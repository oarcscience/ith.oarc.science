<CENTER><H1>The Brewery of Egg-Shells</H1></CENTER>
  <P>
<BR>

  IT may be considered impertinent were I to explain what is meant by a
  changeling: both Shakspeare and Spenser have already done so and who is there
  unacquainted with the Midsummer Night's Dream [Act ii. Sc. 1] and the Fairy
  Queen [Book I. canto 10].</P>

  <P>
Now Mrs. Sullivan fancied that her youngest child had been
  changed by &quot;fairies theft,&quot; to use Spenser's words, and certainly
  appearances warranted such a conclusion; for in one night her healthy,
  blue-eyeed boy had become shrivelled up into almost nothing, and never ceased
  squalling and crying. This naturally made poor Mrs. Sullivan very unhappy; and
  all the neighbours, by way of comforting her, said, that her own child was,
  beyond any kind of doubt, with the good people, and that one of themselves had
  been put in his place.</P>

  <P>
Mrs. Sullivan of course could not disbelieve what every one
  told her, but she did not wish to hurt the thing; for although its face was so
  withered, and its body wasted away to a mere skeleton, it had still a strong
  resemblance to her own boy: she therefore could not find it in her heart to
  roast it alive on the griddle, or to burn its nose off with the red hot tongs,
  or to throw it out in the snow on the road side, notwithstanding these, and
  several like proceedings, were strongly recommended to her for the recovery of
  her child.</P>

  <P>
One day who should Mrs. Sullivan meet but a cunning woman,
  well known about the country by the name of Ellen Leah (or Grey Ellen). She
  had the gift, however she got it, of telling where the dead were, and what was
  good for the rest of their souls; and could charm away warts and wens, and do
  a great many wonderful things of the same nature.</P>

  <P>
&quot;You're in grief this morning, Mrs. Sullivan,&quot; were the
  first words of Ellen Leah to her.</P>

  <P>
&quot;You may say that, Ellen,&quot; said Mrs. Sullivan, and good
  cause I have to be in grief, for there was my own fine child whipped off from
  me out of his cradle, without as much as by your leave, or ask your pardon,
  and an ugly dony bit of a shrivelled up fairy put in his place; no wonder then
  that you see me in grief, Ellen.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Small blame to you, Mrs. Sullivan,&quot; said Ellen Leah;
  &quot;but are you sure 't is a fairy?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Sure !&quot; echoed Mrs. Sullivan, &quot; sure enough am
  I to my sorrow, and can I doubt my own two eyes? Every mother's soul must feel
  for me!&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Will you take an old woman's advice ?&quot; said Ellen Leah,
  fixing her wild and mysterious gaze upon the unhappy mother; and, after a
  pause, she added, &quot;but may be you'll call it foolish? &quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Can you get me back my child, - my own child,
  Ellen?&quot; said Mrs. Sullivan with great energy.</P>

  <P>
&quot;If you do as I bid you,&quot; returned Ellen Leah,
  &quot;you'll know.&quot; Mrs. Sullivan was silent in expectation, and Ellen
  continued, &quot; Put down the big pot, full of water, on the fire, and make
  it boil like mad; then get a dozen new laid eggs, break them, and keep the
  shells, but throw away the rest; when that is done, put the shells in the pot
  of boiling water, and you will soon know whether it is your own boy or a
  fairy. If you find that it is a fairy in the cradle, take the red hot poker
  and cram it down his ugly throat, and you will not have much trouble with him
  after that, I promise you.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Home went Mrs. Sullivan, and did as Ellen Leah desired. She
  put the pot on the fire, and plenty of turf under it, and set the water
  boiling at such a rate, that if ever water was red hot-it surely was.</P>

  <P>
The child was lying for a wonder quite easy and quiet in the
  cradle, every now and then cocking his eye, that would twinkle as keen as a
  star in a frosty night, over at the great fire, and the big pot upon it; and
  he looked on with great attention at Mrs. Sullivan breaking the eggs, and
  putting down the egg-shells to boil. At last he asked, with the voice of a
  very old man, &quot; What are you doing, mammy?&quot;</P>

  <P>
Mrs.. Sullivan's heart, as she said herself, was up in her
  mouth ready to choke her, at hearing the child speak. But she contrived to put
  the poker in the fire, and to answer without making any wonder at the words,
  &quot;I'm brewing, <I>a </I><I>vick,&quot; </I>(my
  son.)</P>

  <P>
&quot;And what are you brewing, mammy?&quot; said the little
  imp, whose supernatural gift of speech now proved beyond question that he was
  a fairy substitute.</P>

  <P>
&quot;I wish the poker was red,&quot; thought Mrs. Sullivan;
  but it was a large one, and took a long time heating: so she determined to
  keep him in talk until the poker was in a proper state to thrust down his
  throat, and therefore repeated the question.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Is it what I'm brewing, <I>a</I> <I>vick,&quot;
  </I>said she, you want to know?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Yes, mammy: what are you brewing ?&quot; returned the fairy.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Egg-shells, <I>a</I> <I>vick,&quot;
  </I>said Mrs. Sullivan.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Oh!&quot; shrieked the imp, starting up in the cradle, and
  clapping his hands together, &quot; I'm fifteen hundred years in the world,
  and I never saw a brewery of egg-shells before!&quot; The poker was by this
  time quite red, and Mrs. Sullivan seizing it, ran furiously towards the
  cradle; but somehow or other her foot slipped, and she fell flat on the <I>floor,
  </I>and the poker flew out of her hand to the other
  end of the house. However, she got up, without much loss of time, and went to
  the cradle intending to pitch the wicked thing that was in it into the pot of
  boiling water, when there she saw her own child in a sweet sleep, one of his
  soft round arms rested upon the pillow his features were as placid as if their
  repose had never been disturbed, save the rosy mouth which moved with a gentle
  and regular breathing.</P>

  <P>
Who can tell the feelings of a mother when she looks upon her
  sleeping child? Why should I, therefore, endeavour to describe those of Mrs.
  Sullivan at again beholding her long lost boy? The fountain of her heart
  overflowed with the excess of joy - and she wept! - tears trickled silently
  down her cheeks, no? did she strive to check them - they were tears not of
  sorrow, but of happiness.</P>
