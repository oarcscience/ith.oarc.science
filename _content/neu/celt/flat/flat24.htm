<CENTER><H1>Cormac and Mary</H1></CENTER>
  <P>
SHE is not dead - she has no grave -<BR>

  She lives beneath Lo ugh Corrib's water [Galway];<BR>

  And in the murmur of each wave<BR>

  Methinks I catch the songs I taught her.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Thus many an evening on the shore<BR>

  Sat Cormac raving wild and lowly;<BR>

  Still idly muttering o'er and o'er,<BR>

  She lives, detain'd by spells unholy.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Death claims her not, too fair for
  earth,<BR>

  Her spirit lives - alien of heaven;<BR>

  Nor will it know: a second birth<BR>

  When sinful mortals are forgiven !</P>

  <P>
Cold is this rock - the wind comes chill,<BR>

  And mists the gloomy waters cover;<BR>

  But oh! her soul is colder still -<BR>

  To lose her God - to leave her lover ! &quot;</P>

  <P>
The lake was in profound repose,<BR>

  Yet one white wave came gently curling,<BR>

  And as it reach'd the shore, arose<BR>

  Dim figures - banners gay unfurling.</P>

  <P>
Onward they move, an airy crowd:<BR>

  Through each thin form a moonlight ray shone;<BR>

  While spear and helm, in pageant proud,<BR>

  Appear in liquid undulation.</P>

  <P>
Bright barbed steeds curvetting tread<BR>

  Their trackless way with antic capers;<BR>

  And curtain clouds hang overhead,<BR>

  Festoon'd by rainbow-colour'd vapours.</P>

  <P>
And when a breath of air would stir<BR>

  That drapery of Heaven's. own wreathing,<BR>

  Light wings of prismy gossamer<BR>

  Just moved and sparkled to the breathing.</P>

  <P>
Nor wanting was the choral song,<BR>

  Swelling in silv'ry chimes of sweetness;<BR>

  To sound of which this subtile throng<BR>

  Advanced in. playful grace and fleetness.</P>

  <P>
With music's strain, all came and went<BR>

  Upon poor Cormac's doubting vision;<BR>

  Now rising in wild merriment,<BR>

  Now softly fading in derision.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Christ, save her soul,&quot; he
  boldly cried;<BR>

  And when that blessed name was spoken,<BR>

  Fierce yells and fiendish shrieks replied,<BR>

  And vanished all, - the spell was broken.</P>

  <P>
And now on Corrib's lonely shore,<BR>

  Freed by his word from power of faery,<BR>

  To life, to love, restored once more,<BR>

  Young Cormac welcomes back his Mary.</P>
