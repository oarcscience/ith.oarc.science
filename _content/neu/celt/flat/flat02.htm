<CENTER><H1>The Legend of Knockfierna</H1></CENTER>
  <P>
[Kockfierna<B>: </B>Called by the people of the country <I>'Knock
  Dhoinn Firinne,' </I>the mountain of Donn of Truth. This mountain is very
  high, and may be seen for several miles round; and when people are desirous to
  know whether or not any. day will rain, they look at the top of Knock Firinn,
  and if they see a vapour or mist there, they immediately conclude that rain
  will soon follow, believing that Donn (the lord or chief) of that mountain and
  his aerial assistants are collecting the clouds, and that he holds them there
  for some short time, to warn the people of the approaching rain. As the
  appearance of mist on that mountain in the morning is considered an infallible
  sign that, that day will be rainy, Donn is called <I>'Dona Firinne,' </I>Donn
  of Truth. &quot;- Mr. Edward O'Reilly]</P>

  <P>
<B>IT</B> is a very good thing not to be any way in dread of
  the fairies, for without doubt they have then less power over a person ; but
  to make too free with them, or to disbelieve in them altogether, is as foolish
  a thing as man, woman, or child can do.</P>

  <P>
It has been truly said, that &quot;good manners are no
  burthen,&quot; and that &quot; civility costs nothing;&quot; but there are
  some people foolhardy enough to disregard doing a civil thing, which, whatever
  they may think, can never harm themselves or any one else, and who at the same
  time will go out of their way for a bit of mischief, which never can serve
  them; but sooner or later they will come to know better, as you shall hear of
  Carroll O'Daly, a strapping young fellow up out of Connaught, whom they used
  to call, in his own country, &quot; Devil Daly.&quot;</P>

  <P>
Carroll O'Daly used to go roving about from one place to
  another, and the fear of nothing stopped him; he would as soon pass an
  churchyard or a regular fairy ground, at any hour of the night, as go from one
  room into another without ever making the sign of the cross, or saying, &quot;
  Good luck attend you, gentlemen.&quot;</P>

  <P>
It so happened that he was once journeying, in the county of
  Limerick, towards &quot; the Balbec of Ireland,&quot; the venerable town of
  Kilmallock; and just at the foot of Knockfierna he overtook a
  respectable4ooking man jogging along upon a white pony. The night wag coming
  on, and they rode side by side for some time, without much conversation
  passing between them, further than saluting each other very kindly; at last,
  Carroll O'Daly asked his companion how far he was going?</P>

  <P>
Not far your way,&quot; said the farmer, for such his
  appearance bespoke him; &quot; I'm only going to the top of this hill
  here.&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;And what might take you there,&quot; said O'Daly,
  &quot;at this time of the night?&quot;</P>

  <P>
&quot;Why then,&quot; replied the farmer,&quot; if you want to
  know; 'tis the <I>good people</I>.&quot;</P>

  <P>
The fairies, you mean,&quot; said O'Daly.</P>


<P>
&quot; Whist
I whist!&quot; said his fellow-traveller, &quot; or you may be sorry for
it;&quot; and he turned his pony off the road they were going towards a little
path which led up the side of the mountain, wishing Carrol O'Daly good night and
a safe journey.</P>

<P>
That fellow,&quot; thought Carroll, &quot; is about no good this
blessed night, and I would have no fear of swearing wrong if I took my Bible
oath, that it is something else beside the fairies, or the good people, as he
calls them, that is taking him up the mountain at this hour. The fairies!&quot;
he repeated, &quot; is it for a well shaped man like him to be going after
little chaps like the fairies! to be sure some say there are such things, and
more say not; but I know this, that never afraid would I be of a dozen of them,
ay, of two dozen, for that matter, if they are no bigger than what I hear tell
of.&quot;</P>

<P>
Carroll O'Daly, whilst these thoughts were passing in his mind,
had fixed his eyes steadfastly on the mountain, behind which the full moon was
rising majestically. Upon an elevated point that appeared darkly against the
moon's disk, he beheld the figure of a man leading a pony, and he had no doubt
it was that of the farmer with whom he had just parted company.</P>

<P>
A sudden resolve to follow flashed across the mind of O'Daly
with the speed of lightning: both his courage and curiosity had been worked up
by his cogitations to a pitch of chivalry; and, muttering &quot;Here's after
you, old boy!&quot; he dismounted from his horse, bound him to an old thorn
tree, and then commenced vigorously ascending the mountain.</P>

<P>
Following as well as he could the direction taken by the figures
of the man and pony, he pursued his way, occasionally guided by their partial
appearance: and, after toiling nearly three hours over a rugged and sometimes
swampy path, came to a green spot on the top of the mountain, where he saw<I> </I>the
white pony at full liberty grazing as quietly as may be. O'Daly looked around
for the rider, but he was nowhere to be seen; he, however, soon discovered close
to where the pony stood an opening in the mountain like the mouth of a pit, and
he remembered having heard, when a child, many a tale about the
&quot;Poul-duve,&quot; or Black Hole of Knockfierna; how it was the entrance to
tbe fairy castle which was within the mountain; and how a man whose name was
Ahern, a land-surveyor in that part of the country, had once attempted to fathom
it with a line, and had been drawn down into it and was never again heard <I>of;
</I>with many other tales of the like nature.</P>

<P>
&quot;But,&quot; thought O'Daly, &quot;these are old woman's
stories; and since I've come up so far<I>, </I>I'll just knock at the castle
door and see if the fairies are at home.&quot;</P>

<P>
No sooner said than done; for, seizing a large stone, as big,
ay, bigger than his two hands, he flung it with all his strength down into the
Poul-duve of Knockfierna. He heard it bounding and tumbling about from one rock
to another with a terrible noise, and he leant his head over to try and hear
when it would reach the bottom, - and what should the very stone he had thrown
in do but come up again with as much force as it had gone down, and gave him
such a blow full in the face, that it sent him rolling down the side of
Knockfierna, head over heels, tumbling from one crag to another, much faster
than he came up. And in the morning Carroll O'Daly was found lying beside his
horse; the bridge of his nose broken, which disfigured him for life ; his head
all cut and bruised, and both his eyes closed up, and as black as if Sir Daniel
Donnelly had painted them for him.</P>

<P>
Carroll O'Daly was never bold again in riding alone near the
haunts of the fairies after dusk; but small blame to him for that; and if ever
he happened to be benighted in a lonesome place, he would make the best of his
way to his journey's end, without asking questions, or turning to the right or
to the left, to seek after the good people, or any who kept company with them.</P>
