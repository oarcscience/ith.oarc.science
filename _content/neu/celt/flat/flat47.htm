<CENTER><H1>Letter from Sir Walter Scott to the author of the Irish Fairy Legends</H1></CENTER>
  <P>
SIR, -- I have been obliged by the
  courtesy which sent me your very interesting work on &quot;Irish
  Superstitions,&quot; and no less by the amusement which it has afforded me,
  both from the interest of the stories and the lively manner in which they are
  told. You are to consider this, sir, as a high compliment from one who holds
  him on the subject of elves, ghosts, visions, etc., nearly as strong as
  William Churns of Staffordshire:</P>

      <P>
&quot;Who every year can mend your
      cheer<BR>

      With tales both old and new.&quot;</P>

  <P>
The extreme similarity of your fictions to
  ours in Scotland is very striking. The Cluricaune (which is an admirable
  subject for a pantomime) is not known here. I suppose the Scottish cheer was
  not sufficient to tempt to the hearth either him, or that singular demon
  called by Heywood the Buttery Spirit, which diminished the profits of an
  unjust landlord by eating up all that he cribbed for his guests.</P>

  <P>
The beautiful superstition of the Banshee
  seems in a great measure peculiar to Ireland, though in some Highland families
  there is such a spectre, particularly in that of MacLean of Lochbuy; but I
  think I could match all your other tales with something similar.</P>

  <P>
I can assure you, however, that the
  progress of philosophy has not even yet entirely &quot;pulled the old woman
  out of our hearts,&quot; as Addison expresses it. Witches are still held in
  reasonable detestation, although we no longer burn or even <I>score above the
  breath. </I>As for the water bull, they live who will take their oaths to
  having seen him emerge from a small lake on the boundary of my property here,
  scarce large enough to have held him, I should think. Some traits in his
  description seem to answer the hippopotamus, and these are always mentioned in
  Highland and Lowland story. Strange if we could conceive there existed, under
  a tradition so universal, some shadowy reference to those fossil bones of
  animals which are so often found in the lakes and bogs.</P>

  <P>
But to leave antediluvian stories for the
  freshest news from Fairyland, I cannot resist the temptation to send you an
  account of King Oberon's court, which was verified before me as a
  magistrate, with all the solemnities of a court of justice, within this
  fortnight past. A young shepherd, a lad of about eighteen years of age, well
  brought up and of good capacity, and, that I may be perfectly accurate, in the
  service of a friend, a most respectable farmer at Oakwood, on the estate of
  Hugh Scott, Esq. of Harden, made oath and said, that going to look after some
  sheep which his master had directed to be put upon turnips, and passing in the
  grey of the morning a small copse-wood adjacent to the River Etterick, he was
  surprised at the sight of four or five little personages, about two feet or
  thirty inches in height, who were seated under the trees and apparently in
  deep conversation. At this singular appearance he paused till he bad refreshed
  his noble courage with a prayer and a few recollections of last Sunday's
  sermon, and then advanced to the little party. But observing that, instead of
  disappearing, they seemed to become yet more magnificently distinct than
  before, and now doubting nothing, from their foreign dresses and splendid
  decorations, that they were the choice ornaments of the fairy court, he fairly
  turned tail and went &quot;to raise the water,&quot; as if the South'ron had
  made a raid. Others came to the rescue, and yet the fairy <I>cortege </I>awaited
  their arrival in still and silent dignity. I wish I could stop here, for the
  devil take all explanations, they stop duels and destroy the credit of
  apparitions, neither allow ghosts to be made in an honourable way or to be 'believed
  in (poor souls !) when they revisit the glimpses of the moon.</P>

  <P>
I must however explain, like other
  honourable gentlemen, elsewhere. You must know, that like our neighbours, we
  have a school of arts for our mechanics at O--,a small manufacturing town in
  this country, and. that the tree of knowledge there, as elsewhere, produces
  its usual crop of good and evil. The day before this avatar of Oberon was a
  fair-day at Selkirk, and amongst other popular divertisements was one which,
  in former days, I would have called a puppet show, and its master a puppet
  showman. He has put me right, however, by informing me, that he writes 'himself
  <I>artist from Vauxhall, </I>and that he exhibits <I>fantoccini; </I>call them
  what you will, it seems they gave great delight to the unwashed artificers of
  G----. Formerly they would have been contented to wonder and applaud, but
  not so were they satisfied in our modern days of investigation, for they broke
  into Punch's sanctuary forcibly, after he had been laid aside for the
  evening, made violent seizure of his person, and carried off him, his spouse,
  and heaven knows what captives besides, in their plaid nooks, to be examined
  at leisure. All this they literally did (forcing a door to accomplish their
  purpose) in the spirit of science alone, or but slightly stimulated by that of
  malt whisky, with which last we have been of late deluged. Cool reflection
  came as they retreated by the banks of the Etterick; they made the discovery
  that they could no more make Punch move than Lord -- could make him speak;
  and recollecting, I believe, that there was such a person as the Sheriff in
  the world, they abandoned their<I> </I>prisoners, in hopes, as they pretended,
  that they would be found and restored in safety to their proper owner.</P>

  <P>
It is only necessary to add that the artist
  had his losses made good by a subscription, and the scientific inquirers
  escaped with a small fine, as a warning not to indulge such an irregular
  spirit of research in future.</P>

  <P>
As this somewhat tedious story contains the
  very last news from Fairyland, I hope you will give it acceptance, and beg you
  to believe me very much, your obliged and thankful servant,</P>

  <P>
&nbsp;</P>

  <P>
WALTER SCOTT<BR>

  ABBOTSFORD, MELROSE, <I>27th April, 1825</P>
