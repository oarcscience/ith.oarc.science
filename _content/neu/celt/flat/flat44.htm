<CENTER><H1>The Rock of the Candle</H1></CENTER>
<P>
&nbsp;</P>

<P>
A FEW miles west of Limerick stands the once formidable castle
of Carrigogunnel. Its riven tower and broken archway remain in mournful evidence
of the sieges sustained by that city. Time, however, the great soother of all
things, has destroyed the painful effect which the view of recent violence
produces on the mind. The ivy creeps around the riven tower, concealing its
injuries, and upholding it by a tough swathing of stalks. The archway is again
united by the long-armed briar which grows across the rent, and the shattered
buttresses are decorated with wild flowers, which gaily spring from their
crevices and broken places.</P>

<P>
Boldly situated on a rock, the ruined walls of Carrigogunnel now
form only a romantic feature in the peaceful landscape. Beneath them, on one
side, lies the flat, marshy ground called Corcass Land, which borders the noble
River Shannon; on the other side is seen the neat parish church of Kilkeedy,
with its glebehouse and surrounding improvements; and at a short distance,
appear the irregular mud cabins of the little village of Ballybrown, with the
venerable trees of Tervoo.</P>

<P>
On the rock of Carrigogunnel, before the castle was built, or
Brien Boro born to build it, dwelt a hag named Grana, who made desolate the
surrounding country. She was gigantic in size and frightful in appearance. Her
eyebrows grew into each other with a grim curve, and beneath their matted
bristles, deeply sunk in her head, two small grey eyes darted forth baneful
looks of evil. From her deeply-wrinkled forehead issued forth a hooked beak,
dividing two shrivelled cheeks. Her skinny lips curled with a cruel and
malignant expression, and her prominent chin was studded with bunches of grisly
hair.</P>

<P>
Death was her sport. Like the angler with his rod, the bag Grana
would toil and watch, nor think it labour, so that the death of a victim
rewarded her vigils. Every evening did she light an enchanted candle upon the
rock, and whoever looked upon it died before the next morning's sun arose.
Numberless were the victims over whom Grana rejoiced ; one after the other had
seen the light, and their death was the consequence. Hence came the country
round to be desolate, and Carrigogunnel, the Rock of the Candle, by its dreaded
name.</P>

<P>
These were fearful times to live in. But the Finnii of Erin were
the avengers of the oppressed. Their fame had gone forth to distant shores, and
their deeds were sung by a hundred bards. To them the name of danger was as an
invitation to a rich banquet. The web of enchantment stopped their course as
little as the swords of an enemy. Many a mother of a son, many a wife of a
husband, many a sister of a brother had the valour of the Finnian heroes bereft.
Dismembered limbs quivered, and heads bounded on the ground before their
progress in battle. They rushed forward with the strength of the furious wind,
tearing up the trees of the forest by their roots. Loud was their war - cry as
the thunder, raging was their impetuosity above that of common men, and fierce
was their anger as the stormy waves of the ocean!</P>

<P>
It was the mighty Finn himself who lifted up his voice, and
commanded the fatal candle of the hag Grana to be extinguished. &quot;Thine,
Regan, be the task,&quot; he said, and to him he gave a cap thrice charmed by
the magician Kuno of Lochlin.</P>

<P>
With the star of the same evening the candle of death burned on
the rook, and Regan stood beneath it. Had he beheld the slightest glimmer of its
blaze, he, too, would have perished, and the hag Grana, with the morning's
dawn, rejoiced over his corse. When Regan looked towards the light, the charmed
cap fell over his eyes and prevented his seeing. The rock was steep, but he
climbed up its craggy side with such caution and dexterity, that before the hag
was aware, the warrior, with averted bead, had seized the candle, and flung it
with prodigious force into the River Shannon, the hissing waters of which
quenched its light for ever !</P>

<P>
Then flew the charmed cap from the eyes of Regan, and he beheld
the enraged hag, with outstretched arms, prepared to seize and whirl him after
her candle. Regan instantly bounded westward from the rock just two miles, with
a wild and wondrous spring. Grana looked for a moment at the leap, and then
tearing up a huge fragment of the rock, flung it after Regan with such
tremendous force, that her crooked hands trembled and her broad chest heaved
with heavy puffs, like a smith's labouring bellows, from the exertion.</P>

<P>
The ponderous stone fell harmless to the ground, for the leap of
Regan far exceeded the strength of the furious hag. In triumph be returned to
Finn :</P>

    <P>
&quot;The hero valiant, renowned and learned;<BR>

    White-tooth'd, graceful, magnanimous, and active.&quot;</P>

<P>
The hag Grana was never heard of more; but the stone remains,
and, deeply imprinted in it, is still to be seen the mark of the hag's
fingers. That stone is far taller than the tallest man, and the power of forty
men would fail to move it from the spot where it fell.</P>

<P>
The grass may wither around it, the spade and plough destroy
dull heaps of earth, the walls of castles fall and perish, but the fame of the
Finnii of Erin endures with the rocks themselves, and <I>Clough-a-Regaun </I>is
a monument fitting to preserve the memory of the deed !</P>
