<CENTER><H1>The Death Coach</H1></CENTER>
  <P>
'T IS midnight ! - how gloomy and dark !<BR>

  By Jupiter there 's not a star! -<BR>

  'T is fearful ! - 't is awful ! - and hark !<BR>

  What sound is that comes from afar?</P>

  <P>
Still rolling and rumbling, that sound<BR>

  Makes nearer and nearer approach;<BR>

  Do I tremble, or is it the ground? -<BR>

  Lord save us ! - what is it ? - a coach ! -</P>

  <P>
A coach ! - but that coach has no head;<BR>

  And the horses are headless as it :<BR>

  Of the driver the same may he said<BR>

  And the passengers inside who sit.</P>

  <P>
See the wheels! how they fly o'er the stones!<BR>

  And whirl, as the whip it goes crack :<BR>

  Their spokes are of dead men's thigh bones,<BR>

  And the pole is the spine of the back!</P>

  <P>
The hammer-cloth, shabby display,<BR>

  Is a pall rather mildew'd by damps;<BR>

  And to light this strange coach on its way,<BR>

  Two hollow sculls hang up for lamps !</P>

  <P>
From the gloom of Rathcooney church-yard,<BR>

  They dash down the hill of Glanmire;<BR>

  Pass Lota in gallop as hard<BR>

  As if horses were never to tire I</P>

  <P>
With people thus headless 't is fun<BR>

  To drive in such furious career;<BR>

  Since <I>headlong</I> their horses can't run,<BR>

  Nor coachman be <I>headdy</I> from beer.</P>

  <P>
Very steep is the Tivoli lane,<BR>

  But up-hill to them is as down;<BR>

  Nor the charms of Woodhill can detain<BR>

  These Dullahans rushing to town.</P>

  <P>
Could they feel as I've felt - in a song -<BR>

  A spell that forbade them depart;<BR>

  They 'd a lingering visit prolong,<BR>

  And after their head lose their heart!</P>

  <P>
No matter ! - 't is past twelve o'clock;<BR>

  Through the streets they sweep on like the wind,<BR>

  And, taking the road to Blackrock,<BR>

  Cork city is soon left behind.</P>

  <P>
Should they hurry thus reckless along,<BR>

  To supper instead of to bed,<BR>

  The landlord will surely be wrong,<BR>

  If he charge it at so much a head!</P>

  <P>
Yet mine host may suppose them too poor<BR>

  To bring to his wealth an increase;<BR>

  As till now, all who drove to his door,<BR>

  Possess'd at least <I>one crown</I> a-piece.</P>

  <P>
Up the Deadwoman's hill they are roll'd;<BR>

  Boreenmannah is quite out of sight;<BR>

  Ballintemple they reach, and behold !<BR>

  At its church-yard they stop and alight.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Who 's there?&quot; said a voice from the ground<BR>

  &quot;We've no room, for the place is quite full.&quot;<BR>

  &quot;O ! room must be speedily found,<BR>

  For we come from the parish of Skull.</P>

  <P>
&quot;Though Murphys and Crowleys appear<BR>

  On headstones of deep-letter'd pride;<BR>

  Though Scannels and Murleys lie here,<BR>

  Fitzgeralds and Toomies beside;</P>

  <P>
Yet here for the night we lie down,<BR>

  To-morrow we speed on the gale;<BR>

  For having no heads of our own,<BR>

  We seek the Old Head of Kinsale.&quot;</P>
