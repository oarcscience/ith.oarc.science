ABOUT the year of God 1031, in the days of Malcolm the Second, King of
Scotland, the Danes and Norwegians, under the conduct of Olanus and
Enetus, seated themselves in the north parts of Scotland, and took the
Castle of Nairn, where they became very strong; from thence they sent
divers companies of soldiers into the neighbouring provinces, not only
to prey, but likewise to seat themselves there, as they should find
occasion and opportunity. Olanus did then send a strong company to
invade the provinces of Ross and Sutherland, and to destroy the
inhabitants; which Allan, Thane of Sutherland, perceiving, he assembled
his countrymen, and the inhabitants of Ross, with all diligence, and
fought a battle at

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Creich, in
Sutherland, against the Danes and Norwegians, who had then come from
Nairn, in Moray, and had landed in the river of Portnacouter, which
divideth Ross from Sutherland. After a long and doubtful fight, the
Danes were overthrown, and chased to their vessels. The monument whereof
remains there unto this day, at a place called Drumilea before Creich.
