### <span class="smallcaps">The Conflict of Blar-na-Pairc</span>.

After the Lord of the Isles had resigned the Earldom of Ross into the
King's hands, the year of God 1477, that province was continually vexed
and molested with incursions of the Islanders. Gillespick (cousin to
Macdonald), gathering a company of men, invaded the height of that
country with great hostility; which, the inhabitants perceiving (and
especially the Clan Mackenzie), they assembled speedily together, and
met the Islanders beside the river of Conon, about two miles from
Brayle, where there ensued a sharp and cruel skirmish. The Clan
Mackenzie fought so hardly, and pressed the enemy so, that in tile end
Gillespick Macdonald was overthrown and chased, the most part of his men
being either slain or drowned in the river of Conon; and this was called
Blar-na-Pairc.
