## THE LAY OF HAROLD <span class="small">\[HARALDSKVÆTHI <span class="small">OR</span> HRAFNSMÓL\] B<span class="small">Y</span> T<span class="small">HÓRBIORN HORNKLOFI</span></span>

N<span class="small">ORWAY</span> enters into the full daylight of
recorded history with King Harold, surnamed Fairhair<span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#note_1) (ca. 860-933), the son of Halvdan the
Black, a petty king of Southeastern Norway. While still a youth, Harold
after a bitter struggle with the independence-loving nobles brought the
whole realm under his sway. The final victorious battle, against a
coalition of chieftains of the West reinforced by auxiliaries from the
British Isles, was a naval action fought in the Hafrs-firth (873), an
inlet of southwest Norway. It is celebrated in this lay. After this
battle, rather than submit and pay tribute to Harold, many nobles left
the land with all their kin and possessions, settling in the Western
Isles and, chiefly, in Iceland.

 Among the engaging qualities of this masterful ruler must be reckoned
his fondness for poetry. We are told in the reliable *Egils saga* that
“of all his followers, he valued most his skalds,”<span
id="fr_2"></span>[2](#note_2) thus probably initiating the tradition of
court poets that lasted for centuries. In fact, he is said to have been
a poet in his own right, like many of his successors. Several of his
court poets are named in the sagas and represented by poems. Of
Thórbiorn hornklofi’s<span id="fr_3"></span>[3](#note_3) personality we
know little, except that he was of high birth and “an old friend of
kings, who had always been attached to their courts.” Two longer poems
are attributed to him, the G*lymdrápa,*<span
id="fr_4"></span>[4](#note_4) a lay apparently descriptive of Harold’s
many battles before accomplishing the unification of Norway, thoroughly
Skaldic in manner, which exists only in inconsiderable fragments; and
the present poem, much simpler in style, which is given no name in the
sources. This, the *Haraldskvæthi* <span id="page_57">p. 57</span> or
*Hrafnsmól,* as it has been called by some editors, is in a most
deplorable condition.

 As here given<span id="fr_5"></span>[5](#note_5) it is pieced together
from fragments found mainly in the large historical work called
*Fagrskinna,*<span id="fr_6"></span>[6](#note_6) which contains a
history of the Norwegian kings. There is considerable difficulty about
the authorship of these portions, some editors considering stanzas 7 to
11, in particular, as a separate poem dealing with the battle in the
Hafrs-firth. The remainder, with descriptions of the life at Harold’s
court, is probably incomplete.

 The structure of the poem is simple. After the usual admonition to the
assembled court to lend their ears, the poet tells us what he heard a
raven—scavenger of the battle-field—say to a valkyrie who questions him
about Harold’s deeds—naturally all warlike ones. For once, the scenes of
carnage here described are individualized. There is grim Viking humor, a
dramatic tension, a zest in these descriptions which one inevitably
associates with a contemporary and participant.<span
id="fr_7"></span>[7](#note_7) Upon her further questioning we are given
realistic, even coarse-grained, glimpses of Harold’s youth, his many
marriages, and his life at court with berserkers, skalds, and jugglers.
In all this, the poem is likely to have set the fashion; possibly also
in the alternation of meters. The greater part is in sonorous
*málaháttr,* smaller portions also in *lióthaháttr* and *fornyrthislag*.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_56">p. 56</span>

<span id="note_1"></span>[1](#fr_1) Concerning his name, cf. the
[note](#note_27) on stanza 10.

<span id="note_2"></span>[2](#fr_2) Their gratitude finds typical
expression in stanza 19.

<span id="note_3"></span>[3](#fr_3) This surname probably means
“raven”—given him with reference, it may be, to his most famous poem.

<span id="note_4"></span>[4](#fr_4) “War-alarum drápa (song of praise).”

<span id="footnotes_page_57">p. 57</span>

<span id="note_5"></span>[5](#fr_5) I follow Finnur Jónsson’s
arrangement.

<span id="note_6"></span>[6](#fr_6) “Beautiful skin (Parchment).”

<span id="note_7"></span>[7](#fr_7) To be sure, it has been observed
that the king could not be said to reside on the estates of Útstein and
Kvinnar until some time after the conquest of the districts in which
they are located.

<span id="note_8"></span>[8](#fr_8) Kenning for “warriors.”

<span id="note_9"></span>[9](#fr_9) As lovers or husbands. The line is
difficult.

<span id="footnotes_page_58">p. 58</span>

<span id="note_10"></span>[10](#fr_10) According to *Grimnismól,* st.
40, the sky was made of the giant Hymir’s skull. The raven cleaves the
sky in his flight.

<span id="note_11"></span>[11](#fr_11) No such estate is known. Very
likely, the famous royal farm on Ogvaldsnes, on the island of Karm
(Rogaland), near the present town of Haugesund, is meant.

<span id="note_12"></span>[12](#fr_12) Adopting Finnur Jónsson’s
emendation.

<span id="note_13"></span>[13](#fr_13) The awnings under which the crew
slept at night.

<span id="note_14"></span>[14](#fr_14) *I.e.,* at sea.

<span id="note_15"></span>[15](#fr_15) The great banquet and reunion,
called the “Yule-ale,” was held at the winter solstice.

<span id="note_16"></span>[16](#fr_16) Frey is the god of fertility and
not associated with warfare. One should expect a valkyrie’s name; but as
it happens the text is clear, and no valkyrie’s name begins with the
alliterating F.

<span id="note_17"></span>[17](#fr_17) Or “pillows.”

<span id="note_18"></span>[18](#fr_18) “Goat-firth,” on the coast of the
old district of Rogaland in southwestern Norway.

<span id="note_19"></span>[19](#fr_19) “The Fat”; which is supposed to
be the nickname for King Guthrœth of Agthir.

<span id="footnotes_page_59">p. 59</span>

<span id="note_20"></span>[20](#fr_20) That of the allies: owing to the
lay of the land in Western Norway, “east” came frequently to be used for
“south.”

<span id="note_21"></span>[21](#fr_21) The warships of the Viking Age
frequently had their stems and sterns carved in the likeness of a
dragon’s head and tail. Hence the term “dragon-ship.”

<span id="note_22"></span>[22](#fr_22) Both designations for fierce
warriors; cf. *Hárbarthslióth,* 37, note.

<span id="note_23"></span>[23](#fr_23) Harold, whose home dominions were
in southeastern Norway.

<span id="note_24"></span>[24](#fr_24) This estate, like those mentioned
above, is situated in southwestern Norway.

<span id="note_25"></span>[25](#fr_25) Nokkvi is the name of a mythical
sea-king; his steed, therefore, is the “ship.”

<span id="note_26"></span>[26](#fr_26) “Long-chin” (or “Long One with
the Harelip”); which is thought to be the nickname for Ólaf the White,
famous Viking chief of Dublin.

<span id="note_27"></span>[27](#fr_27) “Untidy shock of hair,” Harold’s
nickname. The legend tells that, when rejected by the fair Gytha, as not
being the lord of all Norway, he made the vow neither to cut nor comb
his hair till he had brought the whole land under his sway, or else
died. But after he had fulfilled his vow, and had it cut and cleansed,
he was called “Hairfair,” from his long silky hair.

<span id="note_28"></span>[28](#fr_28) *I.e.,* in fleeing.

<span id="note_29"></span>[29](#fr_29) *Glathsheimr* “the shining
abode,” the dwelling of Óthin in Valholl (see *Grimnismól,* stanza 8),
is here substituted by the translator for *Sváfnis salnæfrar*
“the-shingles-of-Óthin’s-hall,” *i.e.,* the shields with which (*ibid*.,
stanza 9) the roof of Óthin’s hall is covered.

<span id="footnotes_page_60">p. 60</span>

<span id="note_30"></span>[30](#fr_30) The present Jæ(de)ren, the
southwesternmost district of Norway.

<span id="note_31"></span>[31](#fr_31) *I.e.,* to be home again at their
ease; but the interpretation is doubtful.

<span id="note_32"></span>[32](#fr_32) Óthin. Fulla, a hypostasis of
Frigg, his wife, is substituted here by the translator.

<span id="note_33"></span>[33](#fr_33) *I.e.,* the ravens. There is the
suspicion that something is lacking after this line.

<span id="note_34"></span>[34](#fr_34) The Danish princess who
superseded Harold’s many other wives.

<span id="note_35"></span>[35](#fr_35) *I.e.,* the wolves.

<span id="note_36"></span>[36](#fr_36) The meaning of this difficult
stanza is, that the Danish women can now no longer taunt Harold for not
having fed the wolves on the carcasses of the slain, *i.e.,* for not
being warlike. It has been supposed that stanzas 13 and 14 may be
fragments of another poem.

<span id="note_37"></span>[37](#fr_37) In order, these districts lie in
the southeast, the west, the east center, and the north, of Norway. The
order has been changed here.

<span id="note_38"></span>[38](#fr_38) The king.

<span id="note_39"></span>[39](#fr_39) Or, perhaps, the game referred to
in *Heithrek’s Riddles,* 26.

<span id="footnotes_page_61">p. 61</span>

<span id="note_40"></span>[40](#fr_40) Here, probably generalized names.

<span id="note_41"></span>[41](#fr_41) It was by no means below the
dignity of warriors to ply the oars in warships; cf. the situation in
*Atlamól hin grœnlænzku,* stanza 34. The oar moved against a tholepin
and was secured by thongs.

<span id="note_42"></span>[42](#fr_42) *I.e.,* the hilts, which were
wound with silver wire.

<span id="note_43"></span>[43](#fr_43) *I.e.,* the shirts of mail.

<span id="footnotes_page_62">p. 62</span>

<span id="note_44"></span>[44](#fr_44) The valkyrie rather falls out of
her rôle in asking about Harold’s jesters and jugglers. The raven voices
the scorn generally felt, and expressed by the skalds, of the low
buffoonery of these foreigners—for such they were generally—who competed
with the skalds for the favors of their prince. The meaning of lines 3-5
is much debated. I follow S. Blöndal’s recent suggestions.
