## THE RIDDLES OF KING HEITHREK<span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#note_1) <span class="small">\[HEITHREKSGÁTUR\]</span>

R<span class="small">IDDLES</span> belong to the popular amusements of
probably all races endowed with sufficient intellectual vivacity and
reflective power to discover analogies. Yet but few collections of them
possess literary value, or even originality, of any sort.

 As is so frequently the case, our Old Norse representative of this
genre does show originality, both in subject and treatment. Moreover,
though the collection is restricted in extent, and cannot, as a whole,
lay claim to great esthetic merit, it is of exceeding interest through
its revealing autochthonous, naïve folk-thought. Most of its riddles are
based on specifically North Scandinavian, or at least, Northern,
environment, beliefs, and conceptions; and are presented in the patterns
evolved in the same region—the greater part in more or less regular
*fornyrthislag* and *lióthaháttr* stanzas. Again, the plastic genius of
the North is evident in the many sharply observed traits of nature,
whose outlines are not blurred by too great subtlety. Compared with
them, the only other notable extant Old Germanic collection, viz., the
Anglo-Saxon riddles of the Exeter Book, will at once be seen to have all
the earmarks of sophistication. And, notwithstanding the several
distinct levels of style, ranging from the homespun manner of such
riddles as the seventh, twelfth, sixteenth, and twenty-eighth, to the
elaborate skaldic diction, with involved kennings, of a few others,
these Northern riddles nowhere smack of “learning.”

 Intrinsically, the collection has nothing to do with the *Hervarar
saga* in which it occurs, but has been rather skillfully connected with
it by means of the widespread folklore motif of a king or giant allowing
some one in his power to ransom himself, or attain the sought object, by
guessing or propounding riddles. With variations, it is used in Old
Norse literature in such poems as *Vafthrúthnismól,* *Alvíssmól,*
*Baldrs draumar,* *Fiolsvithsmól;* <span id="page_86">p. 86</span> but,
to be sure, for the ulterior purpose of inculcating the knowledge of
mythical lore.

 The translation here offered follows the arrangement of the *Hauksbók*
MS—or rather, its derivatives—which is according to form, rather than to
contents; which latter is the principle followed by the other main MS of
the *Hervarar saga*.

 According to the saga, Hervor has two sons by King Heithrek, Angantýr
and Heithrek; of whom the latter inherits both the ruthlessness of his
mother and the wisdom of his father. When king, he makes the vow “that,
however much a man had wronged him, he should have the chance of trial
by his councillors, and that he should go scotfree, if he could propound
any riddle the king could not solve, or else lose his head.” A certain
thane of Heithrek’s, Gestumblindi,<span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#note_2)
had incurred the wrath of the king. In his distress he sacrificed to
Óthin. One night a man came to Gestumblindi, so like him that no one
could tell them apart. They exchanged garments and the stranger went up
to court as Gestumblindi and insisted on his right to free himself by
propounding riddles to the king.

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

1

“That would I have which I had yesterday;  
    heed what I had:  
men’s hamperer, word’s hinderer,  
    and speeder of speech.  
Aright read now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
give him ale! That hampers many a man’s wits; by it, some become
talkative, but other men’s wits are mazed.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

2

“From home I hied me, and from home faring  
    I saw a way of ways:  
<span id="page_87">p. 87</span> was a way beneath and a way above,  
    and ways there were on all sides.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said: \~  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
You went over a bridge, the river ran under it, the birds flew above
your head and on either side of you—that was their way.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

3

“What drink was it I drank yesterday?  
    ’twas neither wine nor water,  
neither mead nor ale, nor meat,<span id="fr_3"></span>[3](#note_3)
either;  
    yet went I thirstless thence.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is.  
you lay down in the shade where the dew had fallen on the grass, and
this cooled your lips and quenched your thirst.  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

4

“Harshly he clangs, on hard paths treading  
    which he has fared before.  
Two mouths<span id="fr_4"></span>[4](#note_4) he has, and mightily
kisses,  
    and on gold alone he goes.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
that is the goldsmith’s hammer with which gold is beaten.”  

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

5

“Who is the great one that glides o’er the earth,  
    and swallows both waters and woods?  
The wind he fears, but wights nowise,  
    and seeks to harm the sun.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
That is the fog. One cannot see the sun because of him, but he
disappears when the wind blows, and men can do naught against him. He
kills the light of the sun.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

6

“Who is the mighty one who o’er much has sway,  
    the half of whom turns toward Hel?  
He saves many men but slashes the earth,  
    if fast with trusty friend.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
That is the anchor, with a stout and strong rope. It guards many a ship.
It grips the earth with one fluke which thus turns Hel-ward. Many a man
has been saved by it.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

7

“On high fells what lives? What falls in deep dales?  
Without air what lives? What is not ever silent?  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
the raven always lives on high fells, the dew always falls in <span
id="page_89">p. 89</span> deep dales, the fish live without air, and the
roaring waterfall is never silent.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

8

“What marvel is it which without I saw,  
    before Delling’s-door,<span id="fr_5"></span>[5](#note_5)  
with his head ever Hel-ward turning,  
    with his feet seeking the sun.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
That is the leek: its head<span id="fr_6"></span>[6](#note_6) turns into
the earth, but the leaves, upward.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

9

“What marvel is it which without I saw,  
    before Delling’s-door?  
Were twain briskly, and breathless withal.  
    boiling a wand-of-wounds.<span id="fr_7"></span>[7](#note_7)  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
they are the smith’s bellows; they blow but have no breath.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

10

“What marvel is it which without I saw,  
    before Delling’s-door?  
The white fliers on the flagstones bounded.  
    but the swart ones sank in the sand.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
they are hail and rain; because the hail beats on the flags, but the
rain drops sink in the sand and go into the ground.”<span
id="fr_8"></span>[8](#note_8)  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

11

“What marvel is it which without I saw,  
    before Delling’s-door?  
A black boar saw I bask in the mud,  
    yet no bristles stood on his back.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
that is the dung-beetle.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

12

“What marvel is it which without I saw,  
    before Delling’s-door?  
Ten tongues has it, has twenty eyes  
and forty feet, slowly fares that wight.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
you saw a sow in the farmyard with nine shoats in her.” Then the king
had the sow killed, and nine pigs were found in her, just as
Gestumblindi had said.  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

13

“What marvel is it which without I saw,  
    before Delling’s-door?  
<span id="page_91">p. 91</span> Upward it flies with eagle’s voice,  
    and hard grip its claws the helmet.<span
id="fr_9"></span>[9](#note_9)  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
that is the arrow.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

14

“What marvel is it which without I saw,  
    before Delling’s-door?  
Eight feet it has and four eyes,  
    and its knees are above its belly.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
it is the spider.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

15

“What marvel is it which without I saw,  
    before Delling’s-door?  
It lights for men, and swallows up lights,<span
id="fr_10"></span>[10](#note_10)  
    and wolves seek ever to win it.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
that is the Sun. He lights all the world and shines on all men; but
there are two wolves, hight Skalli and Hatti, one of whom goes before,
and the other follows, the sun.”<span id="fr_11"></span>[11](#note_11)  

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

16

“What marvel is it which without I saw,  
    before Delling’s-door?  
Harder than horn, blacker than Hel,<span
id="fr_12"></span>[12](#note_12)  
whiter than shell of egg,<span
id="fr_13"></span>[13](#note_13) straighter than shaft of spear.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
that is obsidian, with the sun shining on it.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

17

“Two brides did bear, white-blond their locks,  
and house-maids were they— ale-casks homeward;  
were they not shaped by hand nor by hammers wrought;  
yet upright<span id="fr_14"></span>[14](#note_14) sate he on the isles,
who made them.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
you saw two female swans going to their nests to lay their eggs. Their
shells are neither hand-made nor wrought by hammers; but the he-swan
sits out on the islands, he that gat their eggs with them.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

18

“Who be the women on wilding fell?  
    One bears a babe by the other,  
and maid by maid a man-child begets,  
    yet man has not touched these maids.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
they are two angelica stalks standing together, with a shoot<span
id="fr_15"></span>[15](#note_15) coming up between them.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

19

“Who be the women who, weaponless,  
    for their king kill each other?  
Every day the dark ones shield him,  
    but the fair ones aye go forth.<span
id="fr_16"></span>[16](#note_16)  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
That is the game of *hneftafl*: weaponless, the figures slay each other
for the sake of their king. The red ones<span
id="fr_17"></span>[17](#note_17) are his followers.<span
id="fr_18"></span>[18](#note_18)  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

20

“Who be the playmates that pass over the lands,  
    seeming fair<span id="fr_19"></span>[19](#note_19) to their
father?  
A white shield they show in winter,  
    and a swart one in summer.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
<span id="page_94">p. 94</span> they are the ptarmigans. They are white
in winter and black in summer.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

21

“Who be the sisters that sorrowing fare,  
    seeming fair to their father?  
Many a man their might hath known—  
    and thus they live their lives.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
They are the billows. They are called the maids of Ægir.”<span
id="fr_20"></span>[20](#note_20)  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

22

“Who be the maids that fare, many together,  
    seeming fair to their father?  
Whitish hair have the white-hooded ones,  
    and no man is with the maids.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
but these are the waves, as before.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

23

“Who be the widows that band all together,  
    seeming fair to their father?  
They are seldom kind to sailor-folk,  
    and are wide awake in the wind.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
they are Ægir’s widows. Thus are called the breakers.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

24

“Who be the women that wade in the surf  
    and fare along the firths?  
A hard bed have the white-hooded ones,  
    and quiet are they in calm.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
they are the billows—their beds are skerries and shingle, and they
become somewhat sluggish in calm weather.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

25

“I saw traveling a soil’s-earth-dweller,<span
id="fr_21"></span>[21](#note_21)  
    a corpse sate on a corpse;  
one blind rode a blind thing to the billows’-road,<span
id="fr_22"></span>[22](#note_22)  
    and no life was in the nag.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
you came to a river, and an ice-floe floated down it. On the floe lay a
dead horse, and on the horse, a dead snake; so that one blind thing rode
another blind thing.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

26

“What creature kills the cattle men have,  
    and is iron-clad, without?  
<span id="page_96">p. 96</span> Eight horns it has, but head it has
none,  
    and runs when run it may.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
that is the *húnn*<span id="fr_23"></span>[23](#note_23) on the
checkerboard. It shares its name with the bear, and it runs as soon as
it is overthrown.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

27

“What beast is it which brave men shelters?  
It has a bloody back and wards off blows,  
goes against spears, life-giving to some.  
Against lords’ left hand it lays its body.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
that is the shield. It often becomes bloody in battle, shielding those
men who are handy with it.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

28

“Greatly had grown a goose with big neb,  
had brought timber together, for goslings eager.  
Gave shelter to her the sheaves’-bite-swords;<span
id="fr_24"></span>[24](#note_24)  
but above it lay the drink’s- dinful-rockcave,<span
id="fr_25"></span>[25](#note_25)  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
that is a duck which had built her nest between the jaws of an ox, with
the skull roofing above it.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

29

“Four do hang and four do gang;  
two show the way, two ward off dogs;  
one drags after, most often dirty.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
that is a cow. She has four feet and four tits, two horns and two eyes,
and her tail drags after her.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

30

“Who is the one that in the ashpit sleeps:  
    and is only struck out of stone?  
Neither father nor mother has the greedy fiend—  
    there he wants to live his life.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
that is the fire hidden in the hearth—it is struck out of flint.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

31

“A stallion stood bestriding a mare;  
he put buttock ’neath belly and bobbed with his tail.  
Draw it out and in, work at it long!<span
id="fr_26"></span>[26](#note_26)  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
that horse is a piece of linen on the loom. His mare<span
id="fr_27"></span>[27](#note_27) is the weaver’s reed, and up and down
is the web to be shaken.”<span id="fr_28"></span>[28](#note_28)  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

32

“Who be the thanes to the thing who ride?  
    Sixteen are in that set.  
Their liege-men send they over all the lands,  
    to seek a place to settle.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
they are Itrek and Andath<span id="fr_29"></span>[29](#note_29) sitting
on their checkerboard.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

33

“In the summer saw I, at sunset time,  
a merry band at festive board;  
the men did drink their mead in peace,  
the while the mead-keg muttering stood.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
that is a sow with her shoats. When the pigs suck her she grunts, while
they keep quiet.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

34

“Maidens saw I which were much like dust;  
    boulders served them as beds.  
<span id="page_99">p. 99</span> Are they swart and sallow in sunny
weather,  
    but the fairer, the fainter the light.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
they are the gledes dying on the hearth.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

35

“On a sail I sate and saw dead men  
who a blood-vein bore to the bark of a tree.<span
id="fr_30"></span>[30](#note_30)  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
You sate on a wall and saw a falcon bear an eider duck to the cliff.”  

GESTUMBLINDI said:  

36

“Who are the twain that on ten feet run?  
three eyes they have, but only one tail.  
Aright guess now this riddle, Heithrek!”  

HEITHREK said:  

 

“Good is thy riddle, Gestumblindi,  
    and guessed it is:  
that is Óthin riding on Sleipnir.”<span
id="fr_31"></span>[31](#note_31)  

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>  

   
37

Then Gestumblindi said:  
“Guess one more riddle, since wiser thou seemest  
    than any other wight:<span id="fr_32"></span>[32](#note_32)  
what said Óthin in Baldr’s ear  
    before he was borne to the fire?”<span
id="fr_33"></span>[33](#note_33)  

 

The king answered:  
“But wicked spells and wantonness  
    I ween that it was:  
the words thou spakest no wight knoweth  
    but thou, ill and unclean wight.”<span
id="fr_34"></span>[34](#note_34)  

Then the king drew the sword Tyrfing and struck at Gestumblindi, but he
changed himself into a hawk and flew out through the opening of the
roof. The sword reached the hawk’s tail, and that is why it now has a
short tail, so heathen folk believe. But Óthin was now enraged at
Heithrek, because he had struck at him. That same night the king was
killed with Tyrfing (by thralls who sought revenge and their freedom).

<span id="note_11"></span>[11](#fr_11) Cf. *Grímnismól,* 39; where they
are called Skoll and Hati.

<span id="note_12"></span>[12](#fr_12) In the original: “than the
raven.” In Old Norse, volcanic glass—exceedingly common in Iceland—is
called “raven-flint.”

<span id="note_13"></span>[13](#fr_13) Or rather, than the inner
membrane of the egg.

<span id="note_14"></span>[14](#fr_14) Or “eager.” Both in *malam
partem*.

<span id="note_15"></span>[15](#fr_15) In Old Norse this is called the
“young” of the (Arch)angelica plant, much prized in Scandinavia as a
delicacy.

<span id="note_16"></span>[16](#fr_16) *I.e.,* to assail him.

<span id="note_17"></span>[17](#fr_17) *I.e.,* the “dark ones.”

<span id="note_18"></span>[18](#fr_18) This game was played on a
checkerboard, with hemispherical figures of bone or glass, 12 against
13, the one party white, the other dark. The game turned on one main
figure (hnefi) belonging to the dark party. The turns were decided by
dice.

<span id="note_19"></span>[19](#fr_19) I follow Kock’s suggestion for
the translation of this formula.

<span id="note_20"></span>[20](#fr_20) The god of the sea. This and the
following riddles closely resemble the one in *Baldr’s Dreams*, 12,
which there brings the dénouement. The billows “weep,” casting their
kerchief-corners to the sky—a figure easily interpreted.

<span id="footnotes_page_95">p. 95</span>

<span id="note_21"></span>[21](#fr_21) Kenning for “worm” or “snake.”

<span id="note_22"></span>[22](#fr_22) Kenning for “sea.”

<span id="footnotes_page_96">p. 96</span>

<span id="note_23"></span>[23](#fr_23) “She-bear.” The game here
referred to may have had some resemblance to “Hound and Hare.” The
figures are imagined as cattle killed by a bear. The *húnn* must have
had the shape of a die since it is said to have eight corners (Old Norse
horn may mean both “horn” and “corner”). One such figure was found in
Iceland together with twenty-four others of which half were red and
half, white. Bugge, *Norröne Skritter at Sagnhistorisk Indhold,* p. 358.

<span id="note_24"></span>[24](#fr_24) Literally: “the
biting-blades-of-the-straw”: Kenning for the “jaws” of an ox.

<span id="note_25"></span>[25](#fr_25) Kenning for “skull”: the skull
bones are compared to a passage, through stones, or a “cave,” for drink.

<span id="footnotes_page_97">p. 97</span>

<span id="note_26"></span>[26](#fr_26) Conjectural. The whole stanza of
course *in malam partem*.

<span id="note_27"></span>[27](#fr_27) Obviously, the two are
interchanged.

<span id="note_28"></span>[28](#fr_28) That is, the yarn of the woof
must be alternately lifted up and pressed down with the help of the
crosspiece. Bugge, *loc. cit.,* p. 360.

<span id="note_29"></span>[29](#fr_29) These are the names of the kings
in a modification of chess.

<span id="footnotes_page_99">p. 99</span>

<span id="note_30"></span>[30](#fr_30) This is a good example of the
homonym riddle. Says Bugge, *ibid*., p. 361: “The words that are to be
guessed have two, altogether different, meanings in the original.
Instead of these words, the riddle has expressions which may be said to
have the same meaning as the one sense of the words to be guessed.”
Thus, “dead men” is put for *valr* “falcon,” because this word may also
signify “those fallen in battle.” Instead of *æthr* “eider duck” is set
*blóthshól* “vein,” because *æthr* has also that sense. And apparently,
according to Egilsson, *segl* “sail” is set for *væggr* “wall,” which
word may also mean “wedge”—the shape of the triangular sail. The last
line has so far defied explanation.

<span id="note_31"></span>[31](#fr_31) Óthin’s steed which has eight
legs; cf. *Grímnismól,* 44. Óthin himself has but one eye, having
pledged the other to Mimir; cf. *Voluspó,* 21. This riddle properly
leads to the next, and the dénouement.

<span id="footnotes_page_100">p. 100</span>

<span id="note_32"></span>[32](#fr_32) Prose in the original, but
probably representing a half-stanza. Restored here after Bugge’s
suggestion.

<span id="note_33"></span>[33](#fr_33) The same, insoluble, question—and
thus not really a riddle—is propounded in *Vafthrúthnismól,* 55.

<span id="note_34"></span>[34](#fr_34) This stanza, likewise, is in the
best MSS resolved into prose. Cf. the similar situation at the end of
*Grímnismól*.
