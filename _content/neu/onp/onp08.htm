<H2 ALIGN="center">THE LAY OF HLOTH AND ANGANT&Yacute;R<BR> <SMALL>OR</SMALL><BR> THE BATTLE OF THE HUNS</H2>

<P>T<SMALL>HIS</SMALL> dialogic lay about the hostile half brothers may justly claim high rank among the small number of genuine &#8220;heroic&#8221; poems. In grandeur of theme, in extraordinary vigor and splendor of style, in heroic passion, it challenges comparison with such poems as <I>Atlakvitha</I> and <I>Hamthism&oacute;l;</I> which it resembles also in its air of antiquity, in the epic-dramatic form, in the rugged mixture of <I>fornyrthtslag</I> and <I>m&aacute;lah&aacute;ttr</I> and, alas! also in the sadly mutilated condition of the text. Fully one-third of the original poem seems lost, and a number of stanzas are no doubt corrupted. The total impression is much weakened by the connecting prose, which, in this case, to a large extent represents imperfectly remembered stanzas, with still an occasional rhythm, here and there an alliteration, or a striking phrase suggesting the noble original verse.</P>

<P>&#8195;There are good reasons for thinking the lay a quasi-historical reminiscence from the time of Gothic greatness, transmitted possibly through some South Germanic song&#8212;partial reflection of the tremendous events of the migration period, perhaps the clash of Goth and Hun on the Catalaunian Fields (451), or some other vast battle of nations unrecorded in histories. The conflict is here located on the Dun-heath, whether that locality be the plains of the Danube or those of the Lugii Duni about the upper Oder. In the latter case, it is interesting to note, the Jassar Fells (stanza 27) would correspond to the Jesenik (German, Gesenke), the stretch of hill country which forms the broad gate between the high and impassable Sudeti and the Carpathian ranges. This, again, would permit the inference that the Goths were at that time still in their North European homes by the Vistula<A NAME="fr_1"></A><A HREF="#note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> and the Baltic which, as we know from other sources, they right at

the end of the second century <SMALL>A.D.</SMALL> Ultimate derivation from a Gothic lay of these remote times is no more impossible than in the case of <I>Hamthism&oacute;l,</I> the great figures of Ermanaric and Theodoric, and their relations with Attila forming the very basic layer of Germanic folk hero lore. At any rate there are a number of clear indications that the lay has as its background the vast plains and broad rivers of the east central portions of Europe. Geographic exactness is not to be expected at that distance of time. A clear argument for the very early spread of the story may be seen in the fact that no less than five persons connected with it occur in lines 116-119 of the Anglo-Saxon catalogue poem of <I>W&#299;ds&#299;th</I> from the seventh century&#8212;a poem which also otherwise betrays considerable knowledge of very early Continental conditions.</P>

<P>&#8195;No doubt the episode here celebrated is the original kernel of the composite <I>Hervarar saga</I> in which it is preserved. For the lay after stanza 11 (of this translation) we are dependent on seventeenth-century MSS of the saga.</P>

<P>&#8195;On one of his expeditions the evil but wise son of Hervor, King Heithrek, abducts the daughter of the powerful Humli,<A NAME="fr_2"></A><A HREF="#note_2"><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></A> King of the Huns. She gives birth to Hloth, who is brought up by his maternal grandfather, since Heithrek put his mother away in favor of another queen whose children by him are Angant&yacute;r and Hervor&#8212;a quasi reincarnation of her amazon grandmother. When Heithrek dies Angant&yacute;r succeeds him; but his half brother claims an equal share of the inheritance.</P>

<P>&#8195;Now<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#note_13"><FONT SIZE=1>13</FONT></A> Hloth learned about the death of his father, and that his brother, Angant&yacute;r, had himself made king over all those lands which Heithrek had owned. Then King Humli advised Hloth to claim from Angant&yacute;r his share of the inheritance with fair words; as is said here:</P>

<P>&#8195;But when King Angant&yacute;r heard this, he threw down his trencher on the board and rose and clad himself in his byrnie. He took his white shield in hand, and grasped the sword Tyrfing with the other. Then there arose much din in the hall; as is here said:</P>

<P>&#8195;Gizur, called the Follower<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#note_25"><FONT SIZE=1>25</FONT></A> of the Grytings, King Heithrek&#8217;s faster father, was then in Angant&yacute;r&#8217;s company. He was exceeding old then. When he heard Angant&yacute;r&#8217;s offer he thought that too much was offered, and said:</P>

</TABLE>

<P>&#8195;That winter, King Humli and Hloth stayed at home; but when spring came they drew together so great a host that there

<!------------------------page 42------------------------>

<A NAME="page_42"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 42</FONT></A>

was a dearth of fighting men in Hunland. . . . And when this mighty host was gathered they rode through Murkwood. . . . As they came out of the forest they found many farms and level fields. In the fields there stood a fair castle. There ruled Hervor, Angant&yacute;r&#8217;s and Hloth&#8217;s sister, and with her, Ormar, her foster father. They warded the land against the Huns and had a great host. . . . One morning, about sunrise, Hervor stood on a tower above the castle gate. She saw so much dust southward toward the forest that it hid the sun for a long time. Then saw she a glow under the dust, as though from gold, of fair shields inlaid with gold, of gilded helmets and bright byrnies. Then understood she that this was the Hunnish host, and most numerous. She hurried down and called her trumpeter and bade him summon the host. Then said Hervor to them: &#8220;Take your weapons and make ready for battle; but thou, Ormar, ride out toward the Huns and affer them battle before the southern gate.&#8221;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#note_30"><FONT SIZE=1>30</FONT></A></P>

</TABLE>

<P>&#8195;(And so he did and) then returned to the castle. Then was Hervor armed and all her host. . . . There was a great battle; but because the Huns had a much greater host, the battle turned against Hervor, and at length she fell, and round about her, many men. But when Ormar saw her fall he fled, and with him all they who still lived. He rode day and night as fast as he could, to King Angant&yacute;r in &Aacute;rheimar, while the Huns took to harrying and burning the countryside. When he arrived he said:</P>

<P>&#8195;When Angant&yacute;r heard this he stroked his beard and was silent for a long time. At last he said:</P>

<P>&#8195;It was King Heithrek&#8217;s law, that if a hostile army was in the land and the king of the land challenged them to a pitched battle and appointed the battle field, then those vikings durst not harry before battle was tried between them. Gizur then armed himself with good weapons and leaped on his horse as

The battle lasted eight days, with great slaughter which was made good, in the case of the Goths, by continual reinforcements; so that at last the Huns were forced to give ground. Angant&yacute;r stepped into the front ranks with the sword Tyrfing in hand, and slew both Hloth and Humli. Then the Huns took to flight, and the Goths slew so many that the rivers were dammed up and overflowed their banks and the valleys were filled with dead men and horses. Angant&yacute;r went about on the battlefield to search among the fallen. He found his brother Hloth. Then he said:</P>

<P><A NAME="note_1"></A><A HREF="#fr_1">1</A> In <I>W&#299;ds&#299;th</I> (ll. 119 f) we are told that the Goths defended their ancient home against the Huns &#8220;about the forest of the Vistula.&#8221;</P>

<P><A NAME="note_3"></A><A HREF="#fr_3">3</A> This stanza is held by some not to belong to the lay.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_4"></A><A HREF="#fr_4">4</A> Pronounce Gitsur. Cf. the Prose after 14.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_5"></A><A HREF="#fr_5">5</A> Old Norse <I>Gautar,</I> the inhabitants of the present Swedish provinces of East and West Gotland. Not to be confused with the Goths (Old Norse <I>Gotar</I>)&#8212;a name frequently used in a general and honorific, but here in a special, sense. The seats, at different times, of that noble and gifted race ranged from the Baltic to the Black Sea and thence to Spain.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_6"></A><A HREF="#fr_6">6</A> Used, vaguely, of various west and south European nations.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_7"></A><A HREF="#fr_7">7</A> This name is by some scholars held to be derived from C&aelig;sar, in view especially of <I>W&#299;ds&#299;th,</I> lines 76-78&#8212;<I>mid C&#257;sere, s&#275; the wimburga geweald &#257;hte, Wiolena and Wilna and Wala r&#299;ces</I>.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_8"></A><A HREF="#fr_8">8</A> No such English king is known in legend or history. The name seems identical with that of Abbot &AElig;lfric, the famous writer of the latter part of the tenth century; but unconsciously one thinks of Alfred the Great (849-901).</P>

<P><A NAME="note_9"></A><A HREF="#fr_9">9</A> The hostile brothers no doubt correspond to the <I>Hlithe</I> and <I>Incgenth&#275;ow</I> of <I>W&#299;ds&#299;th</I> (116). <I>Leth</I> was the third king of the Langobardians.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_10"></A><A HREF="#fr_10">10</A> Thus Helgi &#8220;stands in arms&#8221; in earliest infancy; cf. the <I>First Lay of Helgi</I>. The prose preceding rationalizes this heroic trait as follows: &#8220;It was said, in former times, that a man was born &#8216;with weapons and horses,&#8217; for the reason that the weapons lay ready when he was born&#8212;also livestock, such as oxen and horses, if they happened to be born then. All these were given at birth to men of rank, to honor them.&#8221;</P>

<P><A NAME="note_11"></A><A HREF="#fr_11">11</A> <I>I.e.,</I> helmets adorned with strips of plaited rings, as were used in the Viking period.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_12"></A><A HREF="#fr_12">12</A> <I>I.e.,</I> within the confines of royal residence and temple.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_13"></A><A HREF="#fr_13">13</A> This prose link may possibly paraphrase the contents of a lost stanza or stanzas. Still, bearing in mind the abrupt transitions in ballad technique, we need not conclude this.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_14"></A><A HREF="#fr_14">14</A> <I>I.e.,</I> &#8220;River-Dwelling&#8221;; by some supposed to be by the Dniepr River, about which lay the lands of the Goths in the fourth century.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_15"></A><A HREF="#fr_15">15</A> Very evidently, it is Hloth who comes from afar; but the text is ambiguous. To judge from similar passages in other poems, a half-stanza containing a question

<P><A NAME="note_18"></A><A HREF="#fr_18">18</A> Thus the text. Possibly, the awl is taken as representative of peaceful pursuits. &#8220;Edge,&#8221; <I>pars pro toto</I> for &#8220;sword.&#8221;</P>

<P><A NAME="note_19"></A><A HREF="#fr_19">19</A> This great forest is mentioned also in the <I>Lay of Atli,</I> 8, and in the <I>Plaint of Oddr&uacute;n,</I> 23, as separating the land of the Niflungs from that of the Huns.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_20"></A><A HREF="#fr_20">20</A> Bugge (<I>Norr&#339;ne Skrifter,</I> etc., 362) suggests that the &#8220;hallowed grave&#8221; refers to a burial place where the departed Gothic kings were interred; and the &#8220;shining stone,&#8221; to a boulder in the high place of assembly of the Goths on which the newly chosen kings were acclaimed by the people.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_21"></A><A HREF="#fr_21">21</A> <I>I.e.,</I> &#8220;Stead by the Dniepr&#8221; (Latin Danaper), probably. It is mentioned also in <I>R&iacute;gsthula</I>, 49.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_25"></A><A HREF="#fr_25">25</A> Here equivalent to &#8220;armor-bearer&#8221;&#8212;as is, e.g., Hildebrand to Dietrich. The Grytings are probably identical with the Ostrogoths, by the Latin and Greek authors called <I>Greothingi,</I> <I>Grouthingoi</I> (Bugge, <I>op. cit.,</I> p. 273). As the wicked adviser and instigator of strife, he may represent &Oacute;thin. His name may be a reminiscence of the East Germanic name Geiseric (Gizericus).</P>

<P><A NAME="note_26"></A><A HREF="#fr_26">26</A> He sarcastically implies that Hloth would acknowledge himself to be a bastard, entitled to compensation&#8212;and no more&#8212;if he accepted anything but half of his inheritance. Hloth is likened to a shepherd on a hill, tending his flocks, when the kingdom was divided.</P>
