## THE LAY OF VÍKAR <span class="small">\[VÍKARSBÁLKR\]</span>

T<span class="small">HIS FINE</span> but difficult retrospective
monologue is unique in Old Germanic literature; not so much in manner as
in matter. Its hero is, to be sure, the Danish national champion,
Starkath, celebrated in song and story (though this lay is the only
extant poetic treatment of the theme in the original language); but in
this episode he has undergone a change to the sinister and demonic. The
stern warrior and unbending protagonist of the olden simplicity of
morals and customs, such as he appears in the *Lay of Ingiald* and
elsewhere, has here become an uncouth half-troll of superhuman strength
and somewhat dubious, Ahasveric nature. But the lay bespeaks an
unexpected sympathy for this composite character of mixed heroism and
baseness. His crime, the most heinous, according to Old Germanic ethics,
of treacherously slaying his leader and foster brother to whom he is,
moreover, genuinely attached because he owes to him his awakening to the
heroic life—this crime is not to be expiated by “repentance.” To be
sure, the accompanying story, both in the *Gautreks saga,* in which the
lay is interwoven, and in Saxo seeks at least to motivate, and thus
palliate, the deed by laying the blame on Óthin<span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#note_1)—in all the Starkath lays he is the
instigator to strife. But, of course, it is the troll nature that
reveals itself finally, making him a “nithing.”

 As to the prose of the *Gautreks saga* and the similar story of
Saxo,<span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#note_2) it seems to occupy a middle
ground in technique: it is not mainly supererogatory and explicatory
stage direction, as in the oldest lays—say, the *Lays of Skirnir,* of
*Volund;* nor a wordy setting for lays elaborating, and based on, themes
taken from it—as, say, the *Lay of Hiálmar;* but has an independent
value beside the lay, furnishing legendary facts which the lay may not
even hint at, just as the lay in its turn is independent <span
id="page_19">p. 19</span> of the prose. Hence a full account is given
below of the somewhat complicated story.

 There is hardly a question about the Icelandic origin, say in the
twelfth century, of this vigorous and pithy poem. The poor state of
transmission necessitates a number of drastic emendations.
*Fornyrthislag,* with a few *kvithuháttr* lines interspersed, is the
meter employed.

 As the *Hálf’s saga* relates, in its first chapter, the sacrifice of
Víkar to Óthin came about in the following manner: Beautiful Geirhild
managed to be taken as wife by King Alrek of Horthaland<span
id="fr_3"></span>[3](#note_3) through Óthin’s help, on condition that
she should call on the god in all difficulties. King Alrek was married
already to Signy, the daughter of another king. The two wives could not
agree, and Alrek promised that he would retain as his queen her who
brewed the best ale against his return. Signy called on Freya, and
Geirhild on Óthin. He added his spittle for yeast and said that for his
help he must have that which was between her and the vat. Her ale proved
to be the best. Then said Alrek:

if not any evil follow:<br />
on high gallows hanging I see<br />
thy son, Geirhild, given to Óthin.’ ”<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 That same year was born their son Víkar.

 As to Starkath’s origin and youth, we learn from the *Gautreks saga,*
Chapter 3, that his grandfather, the giant Starkath, robbed a princess.
Her father called for aid on Thór, inveterate enemy of the giant tribe,
who slew Starkath and led her back to her father. She gave birth to
Stórvirk—“a handsome man, though black of hair, larger and stronger than
other men.” He becomes right-hand man of King Harold of Agthir. In his
turn, Stórvirk abducts Unni, Earl Freki’s daughter. This deed is avenged
in time by the earl’s two sons, Fiori and Fýri. They burn Stórvirk and
Unni in their hall, but the infant Starkath survives the fire and is
adopted by King Harold. When three years old he is taken thence and
fostered by an old man called Hrosshársgrani <span id="page_20">p.
20</span> (*i.e.,* Óthin) at Ask,<span id="fr_4"></span>[4](#note_4)
where he grows to the age of twelve, uncouth and huge of strength, but
unaware of his powers. Under the same fosterage, and as hostage, grew up
also Víkar, the son (here) of the same King Harold who, meanwhile, was
treacherously slain by a neighboring king, Herthióf. Víkar becomes a
great leader and, joined by Starkath, whom he arouses to action, and
eleven other young warriors, he avenges his father on Herthióf and wins
back his kingdom. On all his various ensuing expeditions Starkath is his
trusted friend and companion and distinguishes himself by deeds of
valor.

 One time, Víkar is held back with his fleet by contrary winds. They
consult the oracle, which pronounces that Óthin must be appeased by the
sacrifice of a man. The lot falls on King Víkar. That same night,
Hrosshársgrani comes to Starkath and bids him follow him. They row to
land. In a forest close at hand the gods are assembled, debating
Starkath’s fate. Óthin, his foster father and protector, bestows on him
all manner of good things, among them, the gift of poetry and three
lives; but Thór, Óthin’s antagonist, who moreover hates Starkath by
reason of his giant origin, adds a misfortune to each gift: in each life
he is to commit some dastardly deed. Óthin, in return for his gifts,
bids Starkath send him Víkar. He consents. On the morrow, Starkath
proposes to the fleet to make a mock sacrifice of Víkar to Óthin. He
induces the king to let him fasten about his neck the soft guts of a
calf, which he attaches to a slender branch of a tree. Then Starkath
touched him with a reed and said: “now I give thee to Óthin,” and let go
of the branch. But the branch lifted Víkar up quickly, the guts did
their service, and the reed became a spear and pierced him.<span
id="fr_5"></span>[5](#note_5) Starkath is outlawed and flees to the
Swedish court where the taunting of inferior men arouses the “speechless
poet” to unburthen his heart in the following monologue.

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

1

“A boy was I when they burned in hall,  
with my father, the warrior host—  
not far outside the firth of Thruma.<span
id="fr_6"></span>[6](#note_6)  

2

“Was Harold of Agthir’s host overthrown—  
had his kinsmen bewrayed the ring-breaker,  
Fiori and Fýri, earl Freki’s heirs.  
Were they Unni’s brothers, my own mother’s;  

3

“the time Herthióf<span id="fr_7"></span>[7](#note_7) Harold betrayed,  
betrayed the king who trusted in him.  
He robbed of his life the liege of Agthir,  
and fetters fastened for his twain sons.  

4

“Me three winters old thence did bring  
Hrosshársgrani<span id="fr_8"></span>[8](#note_8) to Horthaland;  
at Ask gan I grow and strengthen,  
saw none of my sib for nine summers.  

5

“Strength gat I mighty, grew stalwart my arms,  
and long my legs, loathly my head;  
as a gaby, dozing I gaping sate,  
listless and lazy, on lower bench.<span id="fr_9"></span>[9](#note_9)  

6

“Then Víkar wended, from watch-fire faring,<span
id="fr_10"></span>[10](#note_10)  
Herthióf’s hostage, into the hall.  
He knew me again by name and bade me  
up to arise and answer him.  

7

“With hands and fingers he fathomed me:  
were all my arms (much etin-like,)<span
id="fr_11"></span>[11](#note_11)  
<span id="page_22">p. 22</span> to the wrists downward (rough and
hairy,)<span id="fr_11"></span>[11](#note_11)  
and my face bearded from brow to chin.  

8

“Then Harold’s heir<span id="fr_12"></span>[12](#note_12) the host
gathered:  
Sorkvir and Grettir and Hildigrím,  
Erp and Ulf, Án and Skúma,  
Hrói and Hrotti, which were Herbrand’s sons,  

9

“Stýr and Steinthór from Stath<span id="fr_13"></span>[13](#note_13) in
the North,  
gathered also old Gunnólf blesi.<span id="fr_14"></span>[14](#note_14)  
Were then of us thirteen together:  
a hardier host will hardly be found.  

10

“To Herthióf’s hall we hied us then,  
shook its door-posts, broke down its gates,  
shattered its bars, brandished our swords  
where stood seventy stalwart warriors.<span
id="fr_15"></span>[15](#note_15)  

11

“We vied with each other, Víkar to follow<span
id="fr_16"></span>[16](#note_16)  
since first and foremost in the flock he stood;  
we hewed helmets and the heads that bore them,  
sundered byrnies and broke through shields.  

12

“Was great glory granted to Víkar,  
but Herthióf paid for his hateful deed:  
some we wounded, and slew others;  
not far was I stead<span id="fr_17"></span>[17](#note_17) when fell the
king.  

13

“On the Vænir<span id="fr_18"></span>[18](#note_18) wert not with Víkar
then,  
east in the land at early morn,  
<span id="page_23">p. 23</span> in the field when we fought with
Sísar:<span id="fr_19"></span>[19](#note_19)  
were those doughty deeds of undying fame.  

14

“With his sword did he sorely wound me—  
sharp-edged was it— through my shield cleaving.  
My helm he hewed from off my head,  
my chin he cleft clean to the jawteeth.<span
id="fr_20"></span>[20](#note_20)  

15

“And on one side with his sword he cut me—  
mightier than I— the midriff above;  
but through the other he thrust his spear,  
the cold iron, within it stood.<span id="fr_21"></span>[21](#note_21)  

16

“With my sword, Sísar’s side I cut then  
with bitter brand, his belly athwart.  
So wrathfully I raised my sword  
that all my strength I bestowed on it.  

\* \* \*<span id="fr_22"></span>[22](#note_22)  

17

“Much Welsh gold gave me Víkar—  
the red-gold ring which on wrist I wear,  
of three marks’ weight;<span id="fr_23"></span>[23](#note_23) I
Thruma<span id="fr_24"></span>[24](#note_24) gave him.  
I followed the king fifteen summers.  

18

“I followed the king whom foremost I knew:  
my life did I like best then.  
’T was ere we fared— did foul trolls drive us—  
to Horthaland: this happened last.  

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

19

“The outcome this, that Thór gave me  
a nithing’s<span id="fr_25"></span>[25](#note_25) name, unnumbered
woes—  

\* \* \*  

 

I was fated fell things to do.  

20

“In high tree was I to hallow Víkar,  
to give to the gods Geirthiof’s<span id="fr_26"></span>[26](#note_26)
slayer.  
Through his heart I thrust the thane with my spear:  
of all my works most woeful this!  

21

“On wilding ways I wandered thence,  
by the Horthar<span id="fr_27"></span>[27](#note_27) hated, with heart
rueful,  
bereft of rings and robbed of honor,  
leaderless, forlorn in mind.  

22

“Now have I sought the Swedish lands,  
the Ynglings’<span id="fr_28"></span>[28](#note_28) seat, Uppsala
halls.  
A speechless poet,<span id="fr_29"></span>[29](#note_29) the prince’s
sons  
did let me stay— as long I shall.  

23

“They set me here brash<span id="fr_30"></span>[30](#note_30) swains
between,  
who scornfully scoff at the aged skald;  
gleefully girding, they make game of me,  
and lewdly laugh at the liege’s poet.  

24

“They ween they see on my own self  
the etin mark of eight arms,  
<span id="page_25">p. 25</span> the time Hlórrithi<span
id="fr_31"></span>[31](#note_31) Hergrím’s slayer<span
id="fr_32"></span>[32](#note_32)  
reft of his arms in the outmost North.  

25

“The men laugh when looking at me—  
at my loathly mug and long snout,  
my wolf-grey hair and hanging arms,  
my scurvy neck and wrinkled skin.”

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_18">p. 18</span>

<span id="note_1"></span>[1](#fr_1) Cf. also the *Second Lay of Helgi,*
34: “of all evil is Óthin father.” It is instructive to compare the
Herakles of Euripides in this respect.

<span id="note_2"></span>[2](#fr_2) Who derives it from Norwegian
sources.

<span id="footnotes_page_19">p. 19</span>

<span id="note_3"></span>[3](#fr_3) The southwestern district of Norway,
as Agthir (below) is the southernmost.

<span id="footnotes_page_20">p. 20</span>

<span id="note_4"></span>[4](#fr_4) On the island of Fenhring, near the
present city of Bergen. The implied hostility of these divinities, and
Óthin’s assumption, on an island, of the tutelage of his favorite in
sinister arts, recall the story of Geirrœth in the prose of
*Grímnismál*.

<span id="note_5"></span>[5](#fr_5) This story, told similarly by Saxo,
is a reminiscence of the human sacrifices—by hanging and piercing with a
spear—which belonged to the worship of Óthin, the “god of the hanged”
(*Hávamál,* 139.) The circumstances of the sacrifice resemble closely
that of the sacrifice of Iphigenia in Greek lore.

<span id="footnotes_page_21">p. 21</span>

<span id="note_6"></span>[6](#fr_6) The present Tromö-sund, a sound
between the island of Trom-ö and the mainland, near Arendal, on the
southeast coast of Norway.

<span id="note_7"></span>[7](#fr_7) It appears that he joined forces
with Freki, and fell upon both King Harold and Starkath’s father. We are
not told who Víkar’s brother was.

<span id="note_8"></span>[8](#fr_8) “Man with a mustache of (or like)
horse hair”: Óthin, who is frequently pictured as a greybeard.

<span id="note_9"></span>[9](#fr_9) Where the strvants ate: Starkath as
a youth grows up as the typical ashiepattle, huge of body, who conceals
his wits (and his plans of revenge?) under the guise of a tongue-tied
zany. Cf. Helgi in the *Lay of Helgi Hiorvarthsson*.

<span id="note_10"></span>[10](#fr_10) Herthióf had instituted beacon
signals to warn of hostile raids, and Víkar was set over one of them.

<span id="note_11"></span>[11](#fr_11) Lines lacking in the original and
supplied here by guess of the translator.

<span id="footnotes_page_22">p. 22</span>

<span id="note_12"></span>[12](#fr_12) Víkar.

<span id="note_13"></span>[13](#fr_13) The promontory in the west of
Norway.

<span id="note_14"></span>[14](#fr_14) “White-face.”

<span id="note_15"></span>[15](#fr_15) The MSS add the following
(later?) lines:

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>“unafraid of the fray, before their king.<br />
Were there also all of the thralls,<br />
the working men and water-carriers.”<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<span id="note_16"></span>[16](#fr_16) In the original, “it was hard to
follow,” etc., a somewhat unusual thought.

<span id="note_17"></span>[17](#fr_17) Litotes: Starkath slays him.

<span id="note_18"></span>[18](#fr_18) Vænir is the great Swedish lake
on whose frozen surface this, and other, battles were fought. The
following is more particularly addressed to the king’s man who had
taunted Starkath.

<span id="footnotes_page_23">p. 23</span>

<span id="note_19"></span>[19](#fr_19) This redoubtable antagonist bears
the name of the Russian Czar (from *Cisari,* Cæsar).

<span id="note_20"></span>[20](#fr_20) The MSS add:

|                                                |
|------------------------------------------------|
| “my right collar-bone he crushed with a blow.” |

The description of mortal and disfiguring wounds and of other blemishes
is peculiar to the poem.

<span id="note_21"></span>[21](#fr_21) The MSS add:

|                                          |
|------------------------------------------|
| “canst see on me the marks yet, healed.” |

<span id="note_22"></span>[22](#fr_22) At this point, the original
contains eight stanzas, inferior in value and quite evidently
interpolated, dealing with further deeds of Víkar, but speaking of
Starkath in the third person.

<span id="note_23"></span>[23](#fr_23) A “mark” was eight ounces.

<span id="note_24"></span>[24](#fr_24) Which island King Harold had
given Starkath ’s father.

<span id="footnotes_page_24">p. 24</span>

<span id="note_25"></span>[25](#fr_25) “Base villain and coward”; a term
difficult to render in English with one vocable. The stanza is
defective, but evidently the happenings on the island to which Óthin
took Starkath in the night are referred to. The broken style betrays the
agitation of the speaker.

<span id="note_26"></span>[26](#fr_26) Another king, Herthióf’s brother,
slain by Víkar.

<span id="note_27"></span>[27](#fr_27) The inhabitants of Horthaland.

<span id="note_28"></span>[28](#fr_28) The royal race of Sweden,
descended from the god Yngvi-Frey.

<span id="note_29"></span>[29](#fr_29) The exact meaning of Old Norse
*thulr* (here translated “poet”) is not certain, especially in this
passage. If the meaning generally attributed to it, and here followed,
is correct, then we may surinise that the gift of poetry given Starkath
by Óthin was denied utterance by Thór. The princes allow Starkath to
remain silent, brooding over his treachery. For once, he bursts out—with
self-accusation, not in repentance. And he means to relapse into
silence, for a long time.

<span id="note_30"></span>[30](#fr_30) The “white-browed” of the
original I take to refer to their immaturity, contrasted with Starkath’s
swart hairiness.

<span id="footnotes_page_25">p. 25</span>

<span id="note_31"></span>[31](#fr_31) Thór.

<span id="note_32"></span>[32](#fr_32) The older Starkath.
