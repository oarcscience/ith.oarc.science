<H2 ALIGN="center">THE LAY OF INGIALD</H2>

<P>I<SMALL>N THE</SMALL> sixth book of Saxo Grammaticus&#8217;s <I>Gesta Danorum</I> there are embedded, in the narrative of the Danish hero, Starkath&#8217;s, life and deeds, two extensive poems, the <I>Lay of Ingiald</I> and <I>Starkath&#8217;s Death Song;</I> and a third lay, somewhat related to the Icelandic <I>V&iacute;karsb&aacute;lk,</I> is to be inferred from Saxo&#8217;s prose narrative. That there were current lays about Starkath, not only in Scandinavia, but also in Anglo-Saxon England, brought thither from the old home, and that they were in favor, is amply evident from that reproachful passage in one of Alcuin&#8217;s letters:<A NAME="fr_1"></A><A HREF="#note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> &#8220;Quid enim Hinieldus cum Christo? Angusta est domus; utrosque tenere non poterit&#8221;&#8212;What hath Ingiald to do with Christ? Small is the house, it will not hold both&#8212;even if we did not have the well-known Ingeld episode of <I>B&#275;owulf</I> (2024-2069).</P>

<P>&#8195;Like the <I>Biarkam&oacute;l,</I> and likewise Danish in origin, the <I>Lay of Ingiald</I> is an &#8220;exhortation&#8221;&#8212;even more narrowly so&#8212;not to loyal devotion unto death in the king&#8217;s cause, but addressed to the son of the slain father, to bestir himself to revenge. Both the situation and the reaction to it are typical of the Germanic North in pre-Christian times.</P>

<P>&#8195;According to the oldest, and no doubt most original, account as found in <I>B&#275;owulf,</I> the matter is as follows: In a great battle with the Heathobards,<A NAME="fr_2"></A><A HREF="#note_2"><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></A> their king, Fr&#333;da, was slain. In order to effect a reconciliation between the two hostile nations, the Danish king, Hr&#333;thg&#257;r, gave his daughter, Fr&#275;awaru, in marriage to Ingeld, the son of Fr&#333;da; but at the marriage feast&#8212;it seems, in the royal hall of the Heathobards&#8212;a young warrior, stung to the quick by the repeated eggings on of an old warrior, slays one of the Danish company, in order to avenge his father. Ingeld&#8217;s love of the Danish princess &#8220;cools&#8221; (<I>i.e.,</I> he puts her away), the feud breaks out again which according to <I>W&#299;ds&#299;th,</I> ends with the disastrous defeat of the Heathobards before Heorot, the royal hall of the Danes.</P>

</P>

<P>&#8195;This matter is significantly changed, and condensed to far greater dramatic effect, in the Old Danish lay. There, the injured party are the Danes, the ignominious peace and marriage lies in the past. Starkath, the stern old warrior and companion in arms of Fr&oacute;thi, arrives incognito in Leire, where a sumptuous banquet is being given by Ingiald to his brothers-in-law (here called the sons of Sverting), and arouses him by bitter denunciation of his supineness to slay them and put away their sister, his wife. To the r&ocirc;le of the formidable hereditary enemies of the land have succeeded the Germans<A NAME="fr_3"></A><A HREF="#note_3"><FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT></A>&#8212;as well they might under the powerful and aggressive (Saxon) Ottones, who finally compelled the Danes to accept their overlordship and Christianity. The lay has gained, furthermore, by the fierce denunciation of the new and hated Southron ways and by concentrating this invective on Ingiald; who avenges himself on the spot.</P>

<P>&#8195;Starkath&#8217;s own personality is kept in the background, though he is unmistakably felt to be <I>the</I> representative of the older and better ideals of the Viking Age. Since this age, to which the lay harks back with such approbation, had come to an end in the ninth century, after the conquest and settlement of the western and northern Atlantic littoral; since the poem is still thoroughly heathen in spirit; and since the fear and hatred of the Saxon and his ways could have arisen only after the accession of the Saxon emperors, it is safe to conclude that the lay was composed during the tenth century.</P>

<P>&#8195;As for its contents, we are altogether dependent on Saxo&#8217;s prolix and highly rhetorical Latin version&#8212;in Sapphic stanzas and hexameters.<A NAME="fr_4"></A><A HREF="#note_4"><FONT SIZE=1>4</FONT></A> From these, Olrik by judicious reduction brought out the lay approximately as it may have come to the knowledge of Saxo. The version here offered leans on Olrik&#8217;s, but is shorter by nine stanzas through the elimination of some fulsome details improbable in an old lay and, especially, the omission of the weak ending which in Olrik&#8217;s version mars the fine climax of exultation over the revenge accomplished, which Starkath calls on &Oacute;thin to witness.</P>
