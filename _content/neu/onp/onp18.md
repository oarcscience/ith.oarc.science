## THE SUN SONG <span class="small">\[SÓLARLIÓTH\]</span>

W<span class="small">ITH THIS</span> curious poem we are in another
world—that of medieval Christian thought, morality, symbols. Yet,
strangely, there is in it far more of the old and heathen than would
appear at first blush. Indeed, nothing shows more strikingly the
saturation and penetration of the North with the traditional “heathen,”
alliterative art than that such an arch-Catholic poem as *Sólarlióth* is
composed in one of the time-honored forms, *lióthaháttr* or “chant
meter”<span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#note_1)—the measure which is firmly
associated with that arch-heathen collection, *Hóvamól*. Moreover, there
is little doubt that the author consciously patterned his poem—more
specially, the first part of it—on the general plan of that unique
collection of saws in the Germanic spirit. The heathen tradition is seen
no less clearly in numerous stylistic and phraseological reminiscences
from the older collection; so that it would seem that the author, some
pious Icelandic cleric of, say, the thirteenth century, was steeped in
the gnomic lore of his forefathers before even conceiving his poem.
Still further, there are certain similarities with *Hugsvinnsmól,*<span
id="fr_2"></span>[2](#note_2) the translation, (also in *lióthaháttr,*
and possibly by the same person) of the *Dicta Catonis,* a Latin
collection of wise saws in distichs which was very popular in the Middle
Ages. Like the *Sun Song*, it is addressed by a father to his son.
Neither is the substance of our poem, with its inculcation of Christian
ethics, by parable and precept, of any great originality, familiar as
that subject was through a multitudinous literature of homilies,
visions, books of devotion. The great interest, aye, fascination, of the
poem lies, rather, in the remarkable blending and interpenetration of
all these elements to form something individually new which, once read,
is not easily forgotten. It has been aptly called a Christian Eddic lay,
a Christian *Hóvamól;* though it is hardly <span id="page_102">p.
102</span> open to debate that, both as a whole and in its parts, it is
greatly inferior to its prototype.

 The beginning seems abrupt, suggesting the loss of some introductory
stanza or stanzas, to conform with those of the conclusion (81-82). But
for the rest, it appears now, thanks to the searching investigations,
during recent years, of a number of scholars, that the poem forms a
fairly comprehensible and reasonably logical whole; especially when
bearing in mind the visionary character of the latter part and the
nature of its literary sources. They serve to explain a certain general
looseness of structure and a baffling incoherence of thought which has
led some students to doubt the unity of the poem.

 As stated, the poem deals with the Christian way of life, by examples
(1-24) and precepts (the seven Christian counsels, 25-32); but chiefly
by impressive personal experience of death, and of life in the Beyond,
the sight of the punishments and rewards meted out to sinner and saint
(33-75). This scheme leaves as obscure in bearing (and detail) only
stanzas 76-80.<span id="fr_3"></span>[3](#note_3)

 The name of the poem, revealed in 81, seems to have reference, not so
much to the famous initial burthen of the central portion: “The sun I
saw,” as to the Sun as the well-known symbol of Christ.

 We are dependent for our knowledge of the poem on Paper MSS of the
seventeenth century which may all be referred to one and the same
original.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_101">p. 101</span>

<span id="note_1"></span>[1](#fr_1) With frequently only three syllables
in the half-lines.

<span id="note_2"></span>[2](#fr_2) Also, with the Eddic poem
*Fiolsvinnsmól*.

<span id="footnotes_page_102">p. 102</span>

<span id="note_3"></span>[3](#fr_3) These have, somewhat unconvincingly,
been compared to the Rune Poem of *Hóvamól* (139 f.); as, with better
reason, the first portion to the “Óthin Ensamples” (*ibid*., 91-100),
and the second, to *Loddfáfnismól* (*ibid*., 111-137).

<span id="note_4"></span>[4](#fr_4) This unnamed person is to be
imagined as one of the bold solitary robbers who infested the forest and
mountain fastnesses of Scandinavia.

<span id="note_5"></span>[5](#fr_5) Conjectural.

<span id="footnotes_page_103">p. 103</span>

<span id="note_6"></span>[6](#fr_6) *I.e.,* the famished wayfarer. In
the following, the personal pronoun applies, now to the one, now to the
other.

<span id="note_7"></span>[7](#fr_7) Following B. M. Olsen’s
interpretation. The meaning seems to be that the grim outlaw, for once,
takes pity on the frightened wayfarer; who afterwards ill requites him.

<span id="note_8"></span>[8](#fr_8) *I.e.,* overwelled.

<span id="note_9"></span>[9](#fr_9) At the moment. The stanza reminds
one of the many platitudes of *Hugsvinnsmól* (see the Introduction):
“man proposes, God disposes.”

<span id="footnotes_page_104">p. 104</span>

<span id="note_10"></span>[10](#fr_10) These names, as well as most
others occurring in the poem, are evidently made to order.

<span id="note_11"></span>[11](#fr_11) The passage is not certain.

<span id="note_12"></span>[12](#fr_12) *I.e.,* as outlaws.

<span id="note_13"></span>[13](#fr_13) The first woman—or else, Adam and
Eve—came sinless out of the hands of the Creator.

<span id="note_14"></span>[14](#fr_14) Duels were fought out on islands
(holms); hence the expression “to go on the holm” for “to fight a duel.”

<span id="footnotes_page_105">p. 105</span>

<span id="note_15"></span>[15](#fr_15) Evidently a married couple, since
Ráthný is a woman’s name.

<span id="note_16"></span>[16](#fr_16) *I.e.,* in hell.

<span id="note_17"></span>[17](#fr_17) The damned are tortured both by
heat and cold.

<span id="note_18"></span>[18](#fr_18) This very worldly, and certainly
un-Christian, advice corresponds to *Hóvamól,* 89 f.

<span id="note_19"></span>[19](#fr_19) The term in the original may mean
either one who gives good counsel or one who is easily deceived.

<span id="note_20"></span>[20](#fr_20) In certain cases, northern law
allowed the award to be made by the fair-mindedness of one of the
parties to a suit.

<span id="note_21"></span>[21](#fr_21) Cf. the warning *Sigrdrífumól,*
37.

<span id="note_22"></span>[22](#fr_22) The security is given by Sorli to
his enemies.

<span id="footnotes_page_106">p. 106</span>

<span id="note_23"></span>[23](#fr_23) Here, it seems, the *chorus
virginum* that bear up the prayers of men to God. The following, rather
prosy, stanzas are an elaboration on the theme of “pray and ye shall be
given,” somewhat in the form of the arch-heathen *Loddfáfnismál*
(*Hóvamól,* 134 ff.), especially 32.

<span id="footnotes_page_107">p. 107</span>

<span id="note_24"></span>[24](#fr_24) The crown of life.

<span id="note_25"></span>[25](#fr_25) Viz., the Judgment.

<span id="note_26"></span>[26](#fr_26) *I.e.,* are unsteady in the
faith. To the medieval Christian, “doubt” is a mortal sin.

<span id="note_27"></span>[27](#fr_27) These counsels concerning the
Deadly Sins—Pride, Covetousness, Lust, Anger, Gluttony, Envy, Sloth—seem
to refer, in a loose fashion, rather to the preceding stanzas.

<span id="note_28"></span>[28](#fr_28) The following passage is the
kernel of the poem. It deals with life and death, and life in the
Beyond.

<span id="note_29"></span>[29](#fr_29) It is one of pleasure for those
living, but one of terror for those suffering for their sins in hell.

<span id="footnotes_page_108">p. 108</span>

<span id="note_30"></span>[30](#fr_30) That is, of what was to come.

<span id="note_31"></span>[31](#fr_31) Literally, this place for
dwelling in (for a short while).

<span id="note_32"></span>[32](#fr_32) Satan?

<span id="note_33"></span>[33](#fr_33) *I.e.,* death.

<span id="note_34"></span>[34](#fr_34) The meaning of the stanza is
doubtful. Possibly, the maids of hell are the diseases sent by Satan to
torment the dying man.

<span id="note_35"></span>[35](#fr_35) It seems that this world below is
meant, with its tumult and confusion, which reaches the speaker’s ear as
he lies on his deathbed, between this life and the Beyond.

<span id="note_36"></span>[36](#fr_36) The entrance to the realm of the
dead, not necessarily the gates of the Christian hell; cf. the *Short
Lay of Sigurth,* stanza 67.

<span id="footnotes_page_109">p. 109</span>

<span id="note_37"></span>[37](#fr_37) *I.e.,* the sun, which is
feminine in Old Norse. According to Ólson, this passage shows that the
sun is not here to be taken as a symbol (of Christ), but physically.

<span id="note_38"></span>[38](#fr_38) Kenning for “the sea.” (?).

<span id="note_39"></span>[39](#fr_39) *I.e.,* reflecting the bloody red
of sunset.

<span id="note_40"></span>[40](#fr_40) Viz., by contrition, knowing that
his last hour has struck.

<span id="note_41"></span>[41](#fr_41) Accepting Ólsen’s interpretation:
As the eyes of the dying man close, both sun and sea vanish to him.

<span id="note_42"></span>[42](#fr_42) The “star of hope” has been
interpreted as the soul, departing from the body at the time of birth,
viz., into another life: there is an intimate connection between each
human life and its “star.”

<span id="footnotes_page_110">p. 110</span>

<span id="note_43"></span>[43](#fr_43) The night of the “wake.”

<span id="note_44"></span>[44](#fr_44) Cf. *Genesis* 3:19, “Dust thou
art,” etc.

<span id="note_45"></span>[45](#fr_45) The poet seems to complain that
the nearest of kin often do not show loving care for the dying.

<span id="note_46"></span>[46](#fr_46) Separated from his wealth by
death, every man’s destiny is the same.

<span id="note_47"></span>[47](#fr_47) That is, from sin.

<span id="note_48"></span>[48](#fr_48) According to Ólson, whose text I
follow here, this is the Hill of Purgatory (cf. Dante’s Mountain of
Purgatory) where the soul dwells nine days, to be cleansed from nine
deadly sins, then to be lifted up to the highest pinnacle.

<span id="note_49"></span>[49](#fr_49) A difficult passage, but there is
no doubt reference to the light of another world.

<span id="note_50"></span>[50](#fr_50) In this obscure stanza, the
“seats of victory” seem to signify the stations on the way from Hell to
Paradise. According to medieval tradition there are seven worlds
obedient to Christ.

<span id="footnotes_page_111">p. 111</span>

<span id="note_51"></span>[51](#fr_51) *I.e.,* hell.

<span id="note_52"></span>[52](#fr_52) Because coming out of the fire of
cleansing.

<span id="note_53"></span>[53](#fr_53) Leviathan?

<span id="note_54"></span>[54](#fr_54) The glowing Pool (?). The stanza
as a whole is obscure.

<span id="note_55"></span>[55](#fr_55) Very likely, Christ, who in such
legends as those of Placitus, Hubertus, etc., appears as a stag with the
cross between his antlers. He comes to bind together Leviathan and
Lucifer (?).

<span id="note_56"></span>[56](#fr_56) According to Ólson, the seven
Wise Men of the old dispensation, who (like Dante’s poets and sages of
antiquity) are placed at the very entrance, in a *limbus patrum,* where
they indulge in their earthly habits not subjected to torture. But, more
convincingly, Paasche points out that in the homilies, *baugr,* “ring,”
signifies God’s mercy. Hence the-burn-of-the-god(*regin*)-of-the-ring is
a kenning for Christ, who is the “fountain of mercy” (*fons
misericordiæ*) which refreshes the angels.

<span id="note_57"></span>[57](#fr_57) Evidently, as punishment for
adultery. The following stanzas refer to the punishment of the wicked
and the reward of the pious.

<span id="note_58"></span>[58](#fr_58) *I.e.,* millstones.

<span id="footnotes_page_112">p. 112</span>

<span id="note_59"></span>[59](#fr_59) Emasculated? The stanza evidently
refers to the punishment of lecherers.

<span id="note_60"></span>[60](#fr_60) Holy Communion. It is,
doubtfully, suggested that, without it, man is threatened by signs
foreboding hell-torment.

<span id="note_61"></span>[61](#fr_61) The stanza seems to refer to the
punishment of Vanity.

<span id="note_62"></span>[62](#fr_62) “Greedy for Money,” *i.e.*.
Mammon.

<span id="note_63"></span>[63](#fr_63) Instead of the gold they had
craved.

<span id="note_64"></span>[64](#fr_64) As they had run others through
with their swords.

<span id="footnotes_page_113">p. 113</span>

<span id="note_65"></span>[65](#fr_65) The Sabbath-breakers are punished
in the member by which they offended.

<span id="note_66"></span>[66](#fr_66) The sin of Pride was exhibited
chiefly ir their garments.

<span id="note_67"></span>[67](#fr_67) The “Book of Life,” probably, in
which the names of the blessed are recorded. In the following stanzas
the reward of the “virtuous” is pictured.

<span id="note_68"></span>[68](#fr_68) Meant are the pilgrims.

<span id="footnotes_page_114">p. 114</span>

<span id="note_69"></span>[69](#fr_69) Scholars have suggested that the
poet was thinking of the wain of Elijah.

<span id="note_70"></span>[70](#fr_70) In the following, exceedingly
difficult stanzas, the poet seems to return to the punishment of the
wicked. So emended by Ólsen; if correctly, *Hringvor* refers to the sin
of Slander, as *Listvor* does to Treason. both personified as women in
the guise of sirens. Their emanations spread strife among men.

<span id="note_71"></span>[71](#fr_71) As Ólsen ingeniously suggests,
possibly corrupted from (H)*Erebi,* genitive of *Erebus,* the lower
world.

<span id="note_72"></span>[72](#fr_72) Apparently, here *Venus*
(*Freya*).

<span id="note_73"></span>[73](#fr_73) The earth viewed as a ship (?).
Or can the poet here possibly refer to Venus in her shell drifting on
the main?

<span id="note_74"></span>[74](#fr_74) Paasche suggests that *Sólkatla*
is the Heavenly Jerusalem; her sons, therefore, the company of Saints.
But none of the conjectures so far offered seem to clear up this obscure
stanza, whose translation, therefore, mildly put, is uncertain.

<span id="footnotes_page_115">p. 115</span>

<span id="note_75"></span>[75](#fr_75) Hardly the god *Niorth*.

<span id="note_76"></span>[76](#fr_76) Possibly, this name refers to the
sin of Avarice, “the oldest of the sins,” as *Kreppvor* to Pride. Their
sisters are the other mortal sins.

<span id="note_77"></span>[77](#fr_77) It has been suggested that the
meaning is: once men surrender to the deadly sins they become “wolves,”
*i.e.,* commit even unnatural sins.

<span id="note_78"></span>[78](#fr_78) Viz., the son, from his departed
father.

<span id="note_79"></span>[79](#fr_79) *Dies Lætitiæ*.

<span id="note_80"></span>[80](#fr_80) The *Requiem æternum dona eis* of
Catholic prayer.
