## THE LAY OF ERIC <span class="small">\[EIRÍKSMOL\]</span>

T<span class="small">HE MANUSCRIPT</span> *Fagrskinna* is our sole
source for this magnificent lay also. We are told that it was composed
at the behest of Gunnhild, wife of Eric Bloody-axe, oldest of the many
sons of Harold Hairfair, and his heir constituted. Driven by his half
brother, Hákon the Good, from Norway where he was hated on account of
his bloody deeds, Eric fled to England and carved himself a kingdom in
Northumbria. From this, he was driven, too, and killed in a skirmish, it
seems, in the year 950 according to the English Annals. A fierce and
rough warrior, he had few redeeming features besides his bravery. He was
baptized when acknowledging King Eadred of England as his overlord; but
in this encomium of an unknown (Norwegian?) poet the heathen ethos
prevails altogether: warfare as the great content of life.

 The lay is generally regarded as a fragment; but that may be doubted,
for the action seems clear and self-sufficient in its bold simplicity:

 Óthin at break of day soliloquizes—he has dreamed of the advent into
Valholl of a mighty king and that great preparations were made for his
reception. But now, great din arises, and he asks Bragi, the god of
Skaldic art, what it might be. No less joyful it sounds, Bragi thinks,
than if Baldr himself were returning—Baldr whose fall was most fateful
to the gods, and whose longed-for return to Valholl would be for them a
matter of the greatest rejoicing!<span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#note_1) But
Óthin, better acquainted with Fate, recognizes King Eric from afar and
bids two of the heroes of the olden times rise up and welcome him:
*ragnarok,* the Doom of the Gods, is approaching, and heroes such as
Eric will be needed for the impending battle with the monsters of
destruction. Eric draws near; and with him enter into Valholl <span
id="page_64">p. 64</span> no less than five kings slain in battle—worthy
retinue for his apotheosis!<span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#note_2)

 The form of the poem is quite irregular—*málaháttr* followed by loosely
built *lióthaháttr* stanzas. Though a skaldic effort, it is notably
simple in style, and almost without kennings.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_63">p. 63</span>

<span id="note_1"></span>[1](#fr_1) Cf. *Baldr’s Dreams,* 6, 7;
*Voluspó,* 24 ff.

<span id="footnotes_page_64">p. 64</span>

<span id="note_2"></span>[2](#fr_2) It is interesting to note that in
that spirited Anglo-Saxon poem of the *Battle of Brunanburh,* fought not
so many years before (937) and under similar circumstances, the bodies
of five kings likewise lie on the battlefield (line 28).

<span id="note_3"></span>[3](#fr_3) The fallen warriors who are gathered
by the valkyries into Óthin’s hall; cf. *Vafthrúthnismól,* 41.

<span id="footnotes_page_65">p. 65</span>

<span id="note_5"></span>[5](#fr_5) The same reproach is hurled at Óthin
by Loki, *Lokasenna,* 22:

<span id="note_6"></span>[6](#fr_6) Conjecture. Óthin’s defense is that
the best of (fallen) heroes—the *einheriar*—will be needed in the final
battle with the Wolf, Fenrir (cf. *Voluspó,* 45 f.).
