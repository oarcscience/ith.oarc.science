<H2 ALIGN="center">HI&Aacute;LMAR&#8217;S DEATH SONG</H2>

<P>L<SMALL>IKE THE</SMALL> <I>Vikarsb&aacute;lk</I> and <I>Hildibrand&#8217;s Death Song,</I> this essentially monologic lay belongs to a category which forms a masculine counterpart to the feminine retrospective poems of the Edda, such as <I>Helreith Brynhildar</I> and <I>Guthr&uacute;narhv&#491;t</I>: at the point of death, or in the beyond, the speaker lets pass in review the events of his life. This conventional situation conditions a lyric-elegiac mood; which finds especially beautiful, if somewhat facile and not very original, expression in our poem. And inasmuch as there is stress laid on the melancholy &#8220;nevermore&#8221; of lovers beset by a tragic fate, rather than on deeds of valor, we may even speak of a quasi-Romanticism. Indeed, external reasons likewise point to thirteenth-century origin, when medieval influences made themselves felt in the upper levels of Northern society, and French romances and lais were being translated voluminously.</P>

<P>&#8195;Two versions exist, both derived from one now lost&#8212;the one in a MS of the <I>Hervarar saga;</I> the other, both longer and better, in the <I>Orvar Odds saga,</I> which accordingly has been rendered here. However, the lay does not fit organically into the latter saga.</P>

<P>&#8195;Piecing together the accounts in both sagas, the story of Hi&aacute;lmar is as follows: Angant&yacute;r, a ferocious Viking chief, makes a Yuletide vow that he will wed beautiful Ingibiorg, the daughter of King Yngvi at Uppsala in Sweden, or else die. But when he appears there, the princess rejects him in favor of Hi&aacute;lmar, right-hand man of the king, whom she loves. Thereupon Angant&yacute;r challenges Hi&aacute;lmar to single combat, next summer, on the island of Samsey. There, Hi&aacute;lmar and his companion at arms, the redoubtable Orvar Odd (or S&oacute;ti), encounter Angant&yacute;r and his eleven berserker brothers. Hi&aacute;lmar slays Angant&yacute;r, notwithstanding the latter&#8217;s invincible sword Tyrfing, but is mortally wounded himself. Orvar Odd (or S&oacute;ti), protected by a magic silk shirt, is the sole survivor.</P>
