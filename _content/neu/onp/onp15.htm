<H2 ALIGN="center">THE CURSE OF BUSLA<BR> <SMALL>[BUSLUB&#338;N]</SMALL></H2>

<P>T<SMALL>HE MYSTERIOUS</SMALL> power of the word, whether for prayer, benediction or malediction, has been felt at all times. And at all times, both good wishes and imprecations have been apt to clothe themselves in some kind of metric-rhythmic form for greater expressiveness and impressiveness, for enhancing their magic power. And no sooner is the &#8220;formula&#8221; fixed than the need is felt to perpetuate the passing sound of words of such power and value by symbols through which their effect may be multiplied, and even conveyed to some distance in time and space. In the Germanic North the runes&#8212;alphabetic signs which were adopted, it seems, from some Mediterranean alphabet, say, about the beginning of our era<A NAME="fr_1"></A><A HREF="#note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A>&#8212;served this purpose, especially when verbal curses had failed.<A NAME="fr_2"></A><A HREF="#note_2"><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></A> They were scratched (&#8220;written&#8221;) on stone and wood and bone and metal, on weapons, clothing, implements of all kinds to be used by him in whose favor, or against whom, the magic was to take effect.</P>

<P>&#8195;Old High German and Anglo-Saxon literature offers us a wealth of examples of healing, or defensive, magic formulae&#8212;some of them of literary value, like the Merseburg Incantations; but for extended instances of offensive magic we must go to Old Norse literature. The Eddic poems abound with magic of all sorts. As illustrations of &#8220;offensive&#8221; magic we may point out the &#8220;classic&#8221; curses of Sk&iacute;rnir and of Sigr&uacute;n, and the shorter malisons of <I>Lokasenna,</I> <I>Fi&oacute;lsvinnsm&oacute;l,</I> <I>Atlam&oacute;l</I>.<A NAME="fr_3"></A><A HREF="#note_3"><FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT></A> A monument wholly devoted to the purpose of wishing ill &#8220;on&#8221; some one, and perhaps the most instructive of its kind in literature, though admittedly on a lower plane in &aelig;sthetic value than those mentioned,

is the <I>Buslub&#339;n</I> of the <I>B&oacute;sa saga,</I> a Romantic fornaldar saga (legendary tale) of the thirteenth century. Neither is the curse, as a whole, much older; witness certain phrases and views; which, however, does not preclude some portions breathing rank age-old heathendom. It will be noted, by the way, that the last stanza, containing the fiercest rune-magic, does not seem to belong here originally; for whereas all the others contain some proviso, the effectiveness of this curse is dependent, not on King Hring complying with Busla&#8217;s demands, but on his not solving the runic riddle. Very likely, the monument is fragmentary, whether through the pretended squeamishness of the clerical scribe or, as seems more likely, through his not remembering more.</P>

<P>&#8195;The saga tells how, impelled by untoward circumstances, young Herrauth and his companion at arms, B&oacute;si, fight a pitched battle with Herrauth&#8217;s father, King Hring. They are subdued and bound, to be put to death on the morrow; but old Busla, B&oacute;si&#8217;s fostermother, a hag most experienced in witchcraft, approaches the king at night &#8220;and began that curse which is since called Busla&#8217;s Curse. It has become famous. In it are many turns which are bad for Christians to have in their mouths. And this is the beginning of it:&#8221;</P>
