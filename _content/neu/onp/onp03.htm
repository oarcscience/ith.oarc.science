<H2 ALIGN="center">THE OLD LAY OF BIARKI<BR> <SMALL>[BIARKAM&Oacute;L HIN FORNU]</SMALL></H2>

<P>I<SMALL>N A</SMALL> famous passage of his great book on the <I>History of the Norwegian Kings</I> (<I>Heimskringla</I>), Snorri relates how, early at morn, before the fatal battle of Stiklastad (1030), King &Oacute;laf the Saint asked his skald (Th&oacute;rm&oacute;th K&oacute;lbrunarsk&aacute;lld) to intone a song; whereupon he recited the <I>Old Biarkam&oacute;l</I> (<I>Biarkam&oacute;l hin fornu</I>) so that all the army could hear it, and all were pleased; and the men called the lay the <I>Exhortation of the Housecarls</I><A NAME="fr_1"></A><A HREF="#note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> (<I>H&uacute;skarla hvot</I>). In the <I>Legendary Saga of &Oacute;laf</I> we are told, furthermore, that when the king asked Th&oacute;rm&oacute;th what boon he desired, that loyal heart asked for naught better than to be allowed to go before his king in battle, and that it might be granted to him not to survive his lord. &#8220;This answer is in the very spirit of the Biarkam&oacute;l;&#8221;<A NAME="fr_2"></A><A HREF="#note_2"><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></A> as was the poem singularly well chosen, from out of the many Th&oacute;rm&oacute;th no doubt knew, to fit the occasion, for it is a high song of devotion unto death&#8212;and every one felt the king&#8217;s to be a Lost Cause.</P>

<P>&#8195;Unfortunately, only inconsiderable fragments have come down to us of this proud lay, though once it was known all over the North. For a conception of the whole poem we are now dependent on Saxo&#8217;s spirited, but very free and wordy, translation into Latin hexameters,<A NAME="fr_3"></A><A HREF="#note_3"><FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT></A> and on the prolix and novelistic account of the late <I>Hr&oacute;lfs saga kraka</I>. Taking these as his basis, aided by a strong poetic imagination, and with a profound knowledge of Old Norse poetry as a corrective, the Danish scholar, Axel Olrik, essayed to reconstruct the lay in its original form. As to the success of this difficult piece of restoration, one may question a detail, here and there, and yet agree that it is in the main true to the type, and rejoice in the successful

<!------------------------page 4------------------------>

<A NAME="page_4"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 4</FONT></A>

restoration of a noble poem. For its meter Olrik chose the <I>m&aacute;lah&aacute;ttr,</I> irregularly varying with <I>fornyrthislag,</I> which is seen in the few rests preserved. As to structure the poem consists of three long and chiefly lyrical parts of about equal size, separated from one another by brief dramatic interludes. In this decided preponderance of lyric over dramatic elements, as also in the leisurely breadth of the lyric passages, the lay reminds one of the Anglo-Saxon epics rather than of the poems of the Edda with their firmer structure and more energetic movement&#8212;whether now this be due to Danish origin or to the early date of the Icelandic lay used by Saxo. This is estimated by Olrik to be from about 900; but other scholars incline to a much later date (ca. 1200).</P>

<P>&#8195;Putting together the accounts of Saxo and of the saga, the action is as follows: The great hero-king Hr&oacute;lf kraki,<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#note_5"><FONT SIZE=1>5</FONT></A> the son of Helgi (and nephew of Hr&oacute;ar), is assailed in his hall at Leire during the night by his vassal Hiorvarth, the ruler of the Gauts, who is incited to this treachery by his wife Skuld, Hr&oacute;lf&#8217;s own sister (or daughter). Hialti, a youthful champion in Hr&oacute;lf&#8217;s <I>hird,</I> arouses the inmates, and with taunting speeches exhorts them to fight and die for their generous lord, rallying them again and again. After a bitter struggle, Hiorvarth bursts through the castle gate, Hr&oacute;lf falls, but his warriors continue to fight. The castle is fired, it seems by Hr&oacute;lf&#8217;s own men. Meanwhile, Biarki, his greatest champion, who has risen from poverty and finally married Hr&oacute;lf&#8217;s sister Hr&uacute;t, lies in the hall in profound sleep, superinduced by Skuld&#8217;s magic. He wakes at Hialti&#8217;s third call and plunges into battle. But it is too late. Biarki sinks at his beloved chieftain&#8217;s head, Hialti at his feet. When the battle dies down the mortally wounded Biarki is found by Hr&uacute;t and made to see &Oacute;thin riding over the battle field. Dying, he defies him.<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#note_6"><FONT SIZE=1>6</FONT></A></P>

<P>&#8195;The king remains throughout in the background, yet is the invisible center, worthy of the loyalty unto death of such warriors. They but reflect his glory&#8212;Biarki, towering up over the

<!------------------------page 5------------------------>

<A NAME="page_5"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 5</FONT></A>

rest of them, the stern warrior, unyielding in death and defying even the king of the gods; beside him, brisk and steadfast, Hialti, his younger companion at arms, whose ringing alarums are thrice repeated, thanks to the happy retarding device of Biarki&#8217;s magic sleep. Sharp lights fall even on the lesser characters, living and dead&#8212;on wicked Skuld, &#8220;by evil norns for ill created,&#8221; and her husband Hiorvarth, swayed by her &#8220;to his kin to be false, his king to betray&#8221;; on the fierce warrlor Agnar who &#8220;laughs toward death&#8221;; on wretched King Hr&#339;rek and gold-greedy King Athisl. Scelles of the present and the past flit by Hialti&#8217;s and Biarki&#8217;s inner vision, in their supreme hour&#8212;the glorious and deed-filled life of the housecarls in field and in banquet hall, under the eyes of the hero-king. Through their speeches we sense the hurly-burly, and feel the progress, of the battle. We learn of all the noble qualities which the upstanding, manly warrior-life of old allowed to unfold, and above all we appreciate that there may be glory in defeat.</P>
