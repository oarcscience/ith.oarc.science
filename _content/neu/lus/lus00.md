\[*ORIGINAL DEDICATION*, 1776\]

###### TO THE

#### DUKE OF BUCCLEUGH.

MY LORD,

The first idea of offering my LUSIAD to some distinguished personage,
inspired the earnest wish, that it might be accepted by the illustrious
representative of that family under which my father, for many years,
discharged the duties of a clergyman.

Both the late Duke of BUCCLEUGH, and the Earl of DALKEITH, distinguished
him by particular marks of their favour; and I must have forgotten him,
if I could have wished to offer the first Dedication of my literary
labours to any other than the Duke of BUCCLEUGH.

I am, with the greatest respect,  
        My Lord,  
                Your Grace’s most devoted  
                        And most obedient humble servant,

                                WILLIAM JULIUS MICKLE.

"As the mirror of a heart so full of love, courage, generosity, and
patriotism as that of Camoëns, The Lusiad can never fail to please us,
whatever place we may assign to it in the records of poetical
genius."--HALLAM.
