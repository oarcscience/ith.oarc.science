### BOOK V.

#### THE ARGUMENT.

Departure of the expedition under the command of VASCO DE GAMA (A.D.
1497). Mountains of Portugal, Cintra, Morocco. Madeira; the burning
shores of the Desert of Zanhagan; passage of the Tropic; cold waters of
the dark river Senegal. San Jago; pass the rocky coasts of Sierra Leone,
the island of St. Thomas, the kingdom of Congo, watered by the great
river Zaire. They cross the line and behold the magnificent
constellation of the Southern Cross, not visible in the northern
hemisphere. After a voyage of five months, with continued storms, they
arrive in the latitude of the Cape. Apparition of Adamastor, the giant
of the Cape of Storms. His prophecy. The King of Melinda confirms, by
the tradition of his people, the weird story of the Cape-giant told him
by GAMA. Narrative of the voyage continued; arrival of the expedition at
the Port of Good Promise; pass by the ports of Mozambique and Mombas,
and arrive at Melinda.

WHILE on the beach the hoary father stood,  
And spoke the murmurs of the multitude,  
We spread the canvas to the rising gales,  
The gentle winds distend the snowy sails.  
As from our dear-lov’d native shore we fly  
Our votive shouts, redoubled, rend the sky;  
"Success, success!" far echoes o’er the tide,  
While our broad hulks the foamy waves divide.  
From Leo <span id="fr_338"></span>[1](#fn_335) now, the lordly star of
day,  
Intensely blazing, shot his fiercest ray;  
When, slowly gliding from our wishful eyes,  
The Lusian mountains mingled with the skies;

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

Tago’s lov’d stream, and Cintra’s <span id="fr_339"></span>[1](#fn_336)
mountains cold  
Dim fading now, we now no more behold;  
And, still with yearning hearts our eyes explore,  
Till one dim speck of land appears no more.  
Our native soil now far behind, we ply  
The lonely dreary waste of seas, and boundless sky  
Through the wild deep our vent’rous navy bore,  
Where but our Henry plough’d the wave before; <span
id="fr_340"></span>[2](#fn_337)  
The verdant islands, first by him descried,  
We pass’d; and, now in prospect op’ning wide,  
Far to the left, increasing on the view,  
Rose Mauritania’s <span id="fr_341"></span>[3](#fn_338) hills of paly
blue:  
Far to the right the restless ocean roar’d,  
Whose bounding surges never keel explor’d  
If bounding shore (as reason deems) divide  
The vast Atlantic from the Indian tide. <span
id="fr_342"></span>[4](#fn_339)

  Nam’d from her woods, <span id="fr_343"></span>[5](#fn_340) with
fragrant bowers adorn’d,  
From fair Madeira’s purple coast we turn’d: <span
id="fr_344"></span>[5](#fn_340)  
Cyprus and Paphos’ vales the smiling loves  
Might leave with joy for fair Madeira’s groves;  
A shore so flow’ry, and so sweet an air,  
Venus might build her dearest temple there.  
Onward we pass Massilia’s barren strand,  
A waste of wither’d grass and burning sand;  
Where his thin herds the meagre native leads,  
Where not a riv’let laves the doleful meads;  
Nor herds, nor fruitage deck the woodland maze;  
O’er the wild waste the stupid ostrich strays,  
In devious search to pick her scanty meal,  
Whose fierce digestion gnaws the temper’d steel.  
From the green verge, where Tigitania ends,  
To Ethiopia’s line the dreary wild extends.

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

Now, past the limit, which his course divides, <span
id="fr_345"></span>[1](#fn_341)  
When to the north the sun’s bright chariot rides,  
We leave the winding bays and swarthy shores,  
Where Senegal’s black wave impetuous roars;  
A flood, whose course a thousand tribes surveys,  
The tribes who blacken’d in the fiery blaze  
When Phaëton, devious from the solar height,  
Gave Afric’s sons the sable hue of night.  
And now, from far the Libyan cape is seen,  
Now by my mandate named the Cape of Green; <span
id="fr_346"></span>[2](#fn_342)  
Where, midst the billows of the ocean, smiles  
A flow’ry sister-train, the happy isles, <span
id="fr_347"></span>[3](#fn_343)  
Our onward prows the murm’ring surges lave;  
And now, our vessels plough the gentle wave,  
Where the blue islands, named of Hesper old,  
Their fruitful bosoms to the deep unfold.  
Here, changeful Nature shows her various face,  
And frolics o’er the slopes with wildest grace:  
Here, our bold fleet their pond’rous anchors threw,  
The sickly cherish, and our stores renew.  
From him, the warlike guardian pow’r of Spain,  
Whose spear’s dread lightning o’er th’ embattled plain  
Has oft o’erwhelm’d the Moors in dire dismay,  
And fix’d the fortune of the doubtful day;  
From him we name our station of repair,  
And Jago’s name that isle shall ever bear.  
The northern winds now curl’d the black’ning main,  
Our sails unfurl’d, we plough the tide again:  
Round Afric’s coast our winding course we steer,  
Where, bending to the east, the shores appear.  
Here Jalofo <span id="fr_348"></span>[4](#fn_344) its wide extent
displays,  
And vast Mandinga shows its num’rous bays;

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

Whose mountains’ sides, though parch’d and barren, hold,  
In copious store, the seeds of beamy gold <span
id="fr_349"></span>[1](#fn_345)  
The Gambia here his serpent-journey takes,  
And, thro’ the lawns, a thousand windings makes;  
A thousand swarthy tribes his current laves  
Ere mix his waters with th’ Atlantic waves.  
The Gorgades we pass’d, that hated shore, <span
id="fr_350"></span>[2](#fn_346)  
Fam’d for its terrors by the bards of yore;  
Where but one eye by Phorcus’ daughters shar’d,  
The ’born beholders into marble star’d;  
Three dreadful sisters! down whose temples roll’d  
Their hair of snakes in many a hissing fold,  
And, scatt’ring horror o’er the dreary strand,  
With swarms of vipers sow’d the burning sand.  
Still to the south our pointed keels we guide,  
And, thro’ the austral gulf, still onward ride:  
Her palmy forests mingling with the skies,  
Leona’s <span id="fr_351"></span>[3](#fn_347) rugg’d steep behind us
flies;  
The Cape of Palms <span id="fr_352"></span>[4](#fn_348) that jutting
land we name,  
Already conscious of our nation’s <span id="fr_353"></span>[5](#fn_349)
fame.

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

Where the vex’d waves against our bulwarks roar,  
And Lusian towers o’erlook the bending shore:  
Our sails wide swelling to the constant blast,  
Now, by the isle from Thomas nam’d we pass’d;  
And Congo’s spacious realm before us rose,  
Where copious Layra’s limpid billow flows;  
A flood by ancient hero never seen,  
Where many a temple o’er the banks of green, <span
id="fr_354"></span>[1](#fn_350)  
Rear’d by the Lusian heroes, through the night  
Of pagan darkness, pours the mental light.

  O’er the wild waves, as southward thus we stray,  
Our port unknown, unknown the wat’ry way,  
Each night we see, impress’ d with solemn awe,  
Our guiding stars, and native skies withdraw,  
In the wide void we lose their cheering beams,  
Lower and lower still the pole-star gleams.  
Till past the limit, where the car of day  
Roll’d o’er our heads, and pour’d the downward ray:  
We now disprove the faith of ancient lore;  
Boötes shining car appears no more.  
For here we saw Calisto’s <span id="fr_355"></span>[2](#fn_351) star
retire  
Beneath the waves, unaw’d by Juno’s ire.

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

Here, while the sun his polar journeys takes,  
His visit doubled, double season makes;  
Stern winter twice deforms the changeful year,  
And twice the spring’s gay flowers their honours rear.  
Now, pressing onward, past the burning zone,  
Beneath another heaven and stars unknown,  
Unknown to heroes and to sages old,  
With southward prows our pathless course we hold:  
Here, gloomy night assumes a darker reign,  
And fewer stars emblaze the heavenly plain;  
Fewer than those that gild the northern pole,  
And o’er our seas their glitt’ring chariots roll:  
While nightly thus, the lonely seas we brave,  
Another pole-star <span id="fr_356"></span>[1](#fn_352) rises o’er the
wave:  
Full to the south a shining cross <span id="fr_357"></span>[2](#fn_353)
appears,  
Our heaving breasts the blissful omen cheers:  
Seven radiant stars compose the hallow’d sign  
That rose still higher o’er the wavy brine.  
Beneath this southern axle of the world  
Never, with daring search, was flag unfurl’d;  
Nor pilot knows if bounding shores are plac’d,  
Or, if one dreary sea o’erflow the lonely waste.

  While thus our keels still onward boldly stray’d,  
Now toss’d by tempests, now by calms delay’d,  
To tell the terrors of the deep untried,  
What toils we suffer’d, and what storms defied;  
What rattling deluges the black clouds pour’d,  
What dreary weeks of solid darkness lower’d;

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

What mountain-surges mountain-surges lash’d,  
What sudden hurricanes the canvas dash’d;  
What bursting lightnings, with incessant flare,  
Kindled, in one wide flame, the burning air;  
What roaring thunders bellow’d o’er our head,  
And seem’d to shake the reeling ocean’s bed:  
To tell each horror on the deep reveal’d,  
Would ask an iron throat with tenfold vigour steel’d: <span
id="fr_358"></span>[1](#fn_354)  
Those dreadful wonders of the deep I saw,  
Which fill the sailor’s breast with sacred awe;  
And which the sages, of their learning vain,  
Esteem the phantoms of the dreamful brain:  
That living fire, by seamen held divine, <span
id="fr_359"></span>[2](#fn_355)  
Of Heaven’s own care in storms the holy sign,  
Which, midst the horrors of the tempest plays,  
And, on the blast’s dark wings will gaily blaze;  
These eyes distinct have seen that living fire  
Glide through the storm, and round my sails aspire.  
And oft, while wonder thrill’d my breast, mine eyes  
To heaven have seen the wat’ry columns rise.  
Slender, at first, the subtle fume appears,  
And writhing round and round its volume rears:  
Thick as a mast the vapour swells its size,  
A curling whirlwind lifts it to the skies;  
The tube now straightens, now in width extends,  
And, in a hov’ring cloud, its summit ends:

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

Still, gulp on gulp in sucks the rising tide,  
And now the cloud, with cumbrous weight supplied,  
Full-gorg’d, and black’ning, spreads, and moves, more slow,  
And waving trembles to the waves below.  
Thus, when to shun the summer’s sultry beam  
The thirsty heifer seeks the cooling stream,  
The eager horse-leech fixing on her lips,  
Her blood with ardent throat insatiate sips,  
Till the gorg’d glutton, swell’d beyond her size,  
Drops from her wounded hold, and bursting, dies.  
So, bursts the cloud, o’erloaded with its freight,  
And the dash’d ocean staggers with the weight.  
But say, ye sages, who can weigh the cause,  
And trace the secret springs of nature’s laws,  
Say, why the wave, of bitter brine erewhile,  
Should to the bosom of the deep recoil  
Robb’d of its salt, and, from the cloud distil,  
Sweet as the waters of the limpid <span id="fr_360"></span>[1](#fn_356)
rill?  
Ye sons of boastful wisdom, famed of yore,  
Whose feet unwearied wander’d many a shore,  
From nature’s wonders to withdraw the veil,  
Had you with me unfurl’d the daring sail,  
Had view’d the wondrous scenes mine eyes survey’d,  
What seeming miracles the deep display’d,  
What secret virtues various nature show’d,  
Oh! heaven! with what a fire your page had glow’d!

  And now, since wand’ring o’er the foamy spray,  
Our brave Armada held her vent’rous way,

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

Five times the changeful empress of the night  
Had fill’d her shining horns with silver light,  
When sudden, from the maintop’s airy round,  
"Land! land!" is echoed. At the joyful sound,  
Swift to the crowded decks the bounding crew  
On wings of hope and flutt’ring transport flew,  
And each strain’d eye with aching sight explores  
The wide horizon of the eastern shores:  
As thin blue clouds the mountain summits rise,  
And now, the lawns salute our joyful eyes;  
Loud through the fleet the echoing shouts prevail,  
We drop the anchor, and restrain the sail;  
And now, descending in a spacious bay,  
Wide o’er the coast the vent’rous soldiers stray,  
To spy the wonders of the savage shore,  
Where stranger’s foot had never trod before.  
I and my pilots, on the yellow sand,  
Explore beneath what sky the shores expand.  
That sage device, whose wondrous use proclaims  
Th’ immortal honour of its authors’ <span
id="fr_361"></span>[1](#fn_357) names,  
The sun’s height measured, and my compass scann’d,  
The painted globe of ocean and of land.  
Here we perceiv’d our vent’rous keels had past  
Unharm’d the southern tropic’s howling blast;  
And now, approach’d dread Neptune’s secret reign,  
Where the stern power, as o’er the austral main  
He rides, wide scatters from the polar star  
Hail, ice, and snow, and all the wintry war.  
While thus attentive on the beach we stood,  
My soldiers, hast’ning from the upland wood,  
Right to the shore a trembling negro brought,  
Whom, on the forest-height, by force they caught,  
As, distant wander’d from the cell of home,  
He suck’d the honey from the porous comb.

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

Horror glar’d in his look, and fear extreme,  
In mien more wild than brutal Polypheme:  
No word of rich Arabia’s tongue <span id="fr_362"></span>[1](#fn_358) he
knew,  
No sign could answer, nor our gems would view:  
From garments strip’d with shining gold he turn’d,  
The starry diamond and the silver spurn’d.  
Straight at my nod are worthless trinkets brought;  
Round beads of crystal, as a bracelet wrought,  
A cap of red, and, dangling on a string,  
Some little bells of brass before him ring:  
A wide-mouth’d laugh confess’d his barb’rous joy,  
And, both his hands he raised to grasp the toy.  
Pleas’d with these gifts, we set the savage free,  
Homeward he springs away, and bounds with glee.

  Soon as the gleamy streaks of purple morn  
The lofty forest’s topmost boughs adorn,  
Down the steep mountain’s side, yet hoar with dew,  
A naked crowd, and black as night their hue,  
Come tripping to the shore: Their wishful eyes  
Declare what tawdry trifles most they prize:  
These to their hopes were given, and, void of fear  
(Mild seem’d their manners, and their looks sincere),  
A bold rash youth, ambitious of the fame  
Of brave adventurer, Velosó his name,  
Through pathless brakes their homeward steps attends,  
And, on his single arm, for help depends.  
Long was his stay: my earnest eyes explore,  
When, rushing down the mountain to the shore  
I mark’d him; terror urged his rapid strides,  
And soon Coëllo’s skiff the wave divides.  
Yet, ere his friends advanc’d, the treach’rous foe  
Trod on his latest steps, and aim’d the blow.  
Moved by the danger of a youth so brave,  
Myself now snatch’d an oar, and sprung to save:  
When sudden, black’ning down the mountain’s height,  
Another crowd pursu’d his panting flight;  
And, soon an arrowy, and a flinty shower  
Thick o’er our heads the fierce barbarians pour.

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

Nor pour’d in vain; a feather’d arrow stood  
Fix’d <span id="fr_363"></span>[1](#fn_359) in my leg, and drank the
gushing blood.  
Vengeance, as sudden, ev’ry wound repays,  
Full on their fronts our flashing lightnings blaze  
Their shrieks of horror instant pierce the sky,  
And, wing’d with fear, at fullest speed they fly.

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

Long tracks of gore their scatter’d flight betray’d,  
And now, Velosó to the fleet convey’d,  
His sportful mates his brave exploits demand,  
And what the curious wonders of the land:  
"Hard was the hill to climb, my valiant friend,  
But oh! how smooth and easy to descend!  
Well hast thou prov’d thy swiftness for the chase,  
And shown thy matchless merit in the race!"  
With look unmov’d the gallant youth replied,  
"For you, my friends, my fleetest speed was tried;  
’Twas you the fierce barbarians meant to slay;  
For you I fear’d the fortune of the day;  
Your danger great without mine aid I knew,  
And, swift as lightning, to your rescue flew." <span
id="fr_364"></span>[1](#fn_360)

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

He now the treason of the foe relates,  
How, soon as past the mountain’s upland straits,  
They chang’d the colour of their friendly show,  
And force forbade his steps to tread below:  
How, down the coverts of the steepy brake  
Their lurking stand a treach’rous ambush take;  
On us, when speeding to defend his flight,  
To rush, and plunge us in the shades of night;  
Nor, while in friendship, would their lips unfold  
Where India’s ocean laved the orient shores of gold.

  Now, prosp’rous gales the bending canvas swell’d;  
From these rude shores our fearless course we held:  
Beneath the glist’ning wave the god of day  
Had now five times withdrawn the parting ray,  
When o’er the prow a sudden darkness spread,  
And, slowly floating o’er the mast’s tall head  
A black cloud hover’d: nor appear’d from far  
The moon’s pale glimpse, nor faintly twinkling star;  
So deep a gloom the low’ring vapour cast,  
Transfix’d with awe the bravest stood aghast.  
Meanwhile, a hollow bursting roar resounds,  
As when hoarse surges lash their rocky mounds;  
Nor had the black’ning wave, nor frowning heav’n  
The wonted signs of gath’ring tempest giv’n.  
Amaz’d we stood. "O thou, our fortune’s guide,  
Avert this omen, mighty God!" I cried;  
"Or, through forbidden climes adventurous stray’d,  
Have we the secrets of the deep survey’d,  
Which these wide solitudes of seas and sky  
Were doom’d to hide from man’s unhallow’d eye?  
Whate’er this prodigy, it threatens more  
Than midnight tempests, and the mingled roar,  
When sea and sky combine to rock the marble shore."

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

  I spoke, when rising through the darken’d air,  
Appall’d, we saw a hideous phantom glare;  
High and enormous o’er the flood he tower’d,  
And ’thwart our way with sullen aspect lower’d  
An earthy paleness o’er his cheeks was spread,  
Erect uprose his hairs of wither’d red;  
Writhing to speak, his sable lips disclose,  
Sharp and disjoin’d, his gnashing teeth’s blue rows;  
His haggard beard How’d quiv’ring on the wind,  
Revenge and horror in his mien combin’d;  
His clouded front, by with’ring lightnings scar’d,  
The inward anguish of his soul declar’d.  
His red eyes, glowing from their dusky caves,  
Shot livid fires: far echoing o’er the waves  
His voice resounded, as the cavern’d shore  
With hollow groan repeats the tempest’s roar.  
Cold gliding horrors thrill’d each hero’s breast,  
Our bristling hair and tott’ring knees confess’d  
Wild dread, the while with visage ghastly wan,  
His black lips trembling, thus the fiend began:-- <span
id="fr_365"></span>[1](#fn_361)

  "O you, the boldest of the nations, fir’d  
By daring pride, by lust of fame inspir’d,  
Who, scornful of the bow’rs of sweet repose,  
Through these my waves advance your fearless prows,  
Regardless of the length’ning wat’ry way,  
And all the storms that own my sov’reign sway,  
Who, mid surrounding rocks and shelves explore  
Where never hero brav’d my rage before;  
Ye sons of Lusus, who with eyes profane  
Have view’d the secrets of my awful reign,  
Have pass’d the bounds which jealous Nature drew  
To veil her secret shrine from mortal view;  
Hear from my lips what direful woes attend,  
And, bursting soon, shall o’er your race descend.

  "With every bounding keel that dares my rage,  
Eternal war my rocks and storms shall wage,

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

The next proud fleet <span id="fr_366"></span>[1](#fn_362) that through
my drear domain,  
With daring search shall hoist the streaming vane,  
That gallant navy, by my whirlwinds toss’d,  
And raging seas, shall perish on my coast:  
Then he, who first my secret reign descried,  
A naked corpse, wide floating o’er the tide,  
Shall drive------ Unless my heart’s full raptures fail,  
O Lusus! oft shalt thou thy children wail;  
Each year thy shipwreck’d sons shalt thou deplore,  
Each year thy sheeted masts shall strew my shore.

  "With trophies plum’d behold a hero come, <span
id="fr_367"></span>[2](#fn_363)  
Ye dreary wilds, prepare his yawning tomb.  
Though smiling fortune bless’d his youthful morn,  
Though glory’s rays his laurell’d brows adorn,  
Full oft though he beheld with sparkling eye  
The Turkish moons <span id="fr_368"></span>[3](#fn_364) in wild
confusion fly,  
While he, proud victor, thunder’d in the rear,  
All, all his mighty fame shall vanish here.  
Quiloa’s sons, and thine, Mombaz, shall see  
Their conqueror bend his laurell’d head to me;

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

While, proudly mingling with the tempest’s sound,  
Their shouts of joy from every cliff rebound.

  "The howling blast, ye slumb’ring storms prepare,  
A youthful lover, and his beauteous fair,  
Triumphant sail from India’s ravag’d land;  
His evil angel leads him to my strand.  
Through the torn hulk the dashing waves shall roar,  
The shatter’d wrecks shall blacken all my shore.  
Themselves escaped, despoil’d by savage hands,  
Shall, naked, wander o’er the burning sands,  
Spar’d by the waves far deeper woes to bear,  
Woes, e’en by me, acknowledg’d with a tear.  
Their infant race, the promis’d heirs of joy,  
Shall now, no more, a hundred hands employ;  
By cruel want, beneath the parents’ eye,  
In these wide wastes their infant race shall die;  
Through dreary wilds, where never pilgrim trod,  
Where caverns yawn, and rocky fragments nod,  
The hapless lover and his bride shall stray,  
By night unshelter’d, and forlorn by day.  
In vain the lover o’er the trackless plain  
Shall dart his eyes, and cheer his spouse in vain.  
Her tender limbs, and breast of mountain snow,  
Where, ne’er before, intruding blast might blow,  
Parch’d by the sun, and shrivell’d by the cold  
Of dewy night, shall he, fond man, behold.  
Thus, wand’ring wide, a thousand ills o’erpast,  
In fond embraces they shall sink at last;  
While pitying tears their dying eyes o’erflow,  
And the last sigh shall wail each other’s woe. <span
id="fr_369"></span>[1](#fn_365)

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

  "Some few, the sad companions of their fate,  
Shall yet survive, protected by my hate,  
On Tagus’ banks the dismal tale to tell,  
How, blasted by my frown, your heroes fell."

  He paus’d, in act still further to disclose  
A long, a dreary prophecy of woes:  
When springing onward, loud my voice resounds,  
And midst his rage the threat’ning shade confounds.  
"What art thou, horrid form, that rid’st the air?  
By Heaven’s eternal light, stern fiend, declare."  
His lips he writhes, his eyes far round he throws,  
And, from his breast, deep hollow groans arose,  
Sternly askance he stood: with wounded pride  
And anguish torn, "In me, behold," he cried,  
While dark-red sparkles from his eyeballs roll’d,  
"In me the Spirit of the Cape behold,  
That rock, by you the Cape of Tempests nam’d,  
By Neptune’s rage, in horrid earthquakes fram’d,  
When Jove’s red bolts o’er Titan’s offspring flam’d.

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

With wide-stretch’d piles I guard the pathless strand,  
And Afric’s southern mound, unmov’d, I stand:  
Nor Roman prow, nor daring Tyrian oar  
Ere dash’d the white wave foaming to my shore;  
Nor Greece, nor Carthage ever spread the sail  
On these my seas, to catch the trading gale.  
You, you alone have dar’d to plough my main,  
And, with the human voice, disturb my lonesome reign."

  He spoke, and deep a lengthen’d sigh he drew,  
A doleful sound, and vanish’d from the view:  
The frighten’d billows gave a rolling swell,  
And, distant far, prolong’d the dismal yell,  
Faint, and more faint the howling echoes die,  
And the black cloud dispersing, leaves the sky.  
High to the angel-host, whose guardian care  
Had ever round us watch’d, my hands I rear,  
And Heaven’s dread King implore: "As o’er our head  
The fiend dissolv’d, an empty shadow fled;  
So may his curses, by the winds of heav’n,  
Far o’er the deep, their idle sport, be driv’n!"------

  With sacred horror thrill’d, Melinda’s lord  
Held up the eager hand, and caught the word.  
"Oh, wondrous faith of ancient days," he cries,  
"Conceal’d in mystic lore and dark disguise!  
Taught by their sires, our hoary fathers tell,  
On these rude shores a giant-spectre fell,  
What time, from heaven the rebel band were thrown: <span
id="fr_370"></span>[1](#fn_366)  
And oft the wand’ring swain has heard his moan.  
While o’er the wave the clouded moon appears  
To hide her weeping face, his voice he rears  
O’er the wild storm. Deep in the days of yore,  
A holy pilgrim trod the nightly shore;  
Stern groans he heard; by ghostly spells controll’d,  
His fate, mysterious, thus the spectre told:  
’By forceful Titan’s warm embrace compress’d,  
The rock-ribb’d mother, Earth, his love confess’d:

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

The hundred-handed giant <span id="fr_371"></span>[1](#fn_367) at a
birth,  
And me, she bore, nor slept my hopes on earth;  
My heart avow’d, my sire’s ethereal flame;  
Great Adamastor, then, my dreaded name.  
In my bold brother’s glorious toils engaged,  
Tremendous war against the gods I waged:  
Yet, not to reach the throne of heaven I try,  
With mountain pil’d on mountain to the sky;  
To me the conquest of the seas befel,  
In his green realm the second Jove to quell.  
Nor did ambition all ray passions hold,  
’Twas love that prompted an attempt so bold.  
Ah me, one summer in the cool of day,  
I saw the Nereids on the sandy bay,  
With lovely Thetis from the wave, advance  
In mirthful frolic, and the naked dance.  
In all her charms reveal’d the goddess trod,  
With fiercest fires my struggling bosom glow’d;  
Yet, yet I feel them burning in my heart,  
And hopeless, languish with the raging smart.  
For her, each goddess of the heavens I scorn’d,  
For her alone my fervent ardour burn’d.  
In vain I woo’d her to the lover’s bed,  
From my grim form, with horror, mute she fled.  
Madd’ning with love, by force I weep to gain  
The silver goddess of the blue domain;  
To the hoar mother of the Nereid band <span
id="fr_372"></span>[2](#fn_368)  
I tell my purpose, and her aid command:  
By fear impell’d, old Doris tries to move,  
And, win the spouse of Peleus to my love.  
The silver goddess with a smile replies,  
"What nymph can yield her charms a giant’s prize!  
Yet, from the horrors of a war to save,  
And guard in peace our empire of the wave,  
Whate’er with honour he may hope to gain,  
That, let him hope his wish shall soon attain."

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

The promis’d grace infus’d a bolder fire,  
And shook my mighty limbs with fierce desire.  
But ah, what error spreads its dreadful night,  
What phantoms hover o’er the lover’s sight!  
The war resign’d, my steps by Doris led,  
While gentle eve her shadowy mantle spread,  
Before my steps the snowy Thetis shone  
In all her charms, all naked, and alone.  
Swift as the wind with open arms I sprung,  
And, round her waist with joy delirious clung:  
In all the transports of the warm embrace,  
A hundred kisses on her angel face,  
On all its various charms my rage bestows,  
And, on her cheek, my cheek enraptur’d glows.  
When, oh, what anguish while my shame I tell!  
What fix’d despair, what rage my bosom swell!  
Here was no goddess, here no heav’nly charms,  
A rugged mountain fill’d my eager arms,  
Whose rocky top, o’erhung with matted brier,  
Receiv’d the kisses of my am’rous fire.  
Wak’d from my dream, cold horror freez’d my blood;  
Fix’d as a rock, before the rock I stood;  
"O fairest goddess of the ocean train,  
Behold the triumph of thy proud disdain;  
Yet why," I cried, "with all I wish’d decoy,  
And, when exulting in the dream of joy,  
A horrid mountain to mine arms convey!"  
Madd’ning I spoke, and furious, sprung away.  
Far to the south I sought the world unknown,  
Where I, unheard, unscorn’d, might wail alone,  
My foul dishonour, and my tears to hide,  
And shun the triumph of the goddess’ pride.  
My brothers, now, by Jove’s red arm o’erthrown,  
Beneath huge mountains, pil’d on mountains groan;  
And I, who taught each echo to deplore,  
And tell my sorrows to the desert shore,  
I felt the hand of Jove my crimes pursue,  
My stiff’ning flesh to earthy ridges grew,  
And my huge bones, no more by marrow warm’d,  
To horrid piles, and ribs of rock transform’d,  
Yon dark-brow’d cape of monstrous size became,  
Where, round me still, in triumph o’er my shame,

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

The silv’ry Thetis bids her surges roar,  
And waft my groans along the dreary shore.’"------

  Melinda’s monarch thus the tale pursu’d,  
Of ancient faith, and GAMA thus renew’d:--

  Now, from the wave the chariot of the day,  
Whirl’d by the fiery coursers, springs away,  
When, full in view, the giant Cape appears,  
Wide spreads its limbs, and high its shoulders rears;  
Behind us, now, it curves the bending side,  
And our bold vessels plough the eastern tide.  
Nor long excursive off at sea we stand,  
A cultur’d shore invites us to the land.  
Here their sweet scenes the rural joys bestow,  
And give our wearied minds a lively glow. <span
id="fr_373"></span>[1](#fn_369)  
The tenants of the coast, a festive band,  
With dances meet us on the yellow sand;  
Their brides on slow-pac’d oxen rode behind;  
The spreading horns with flow’ry garlands twin’d,  
Bespoke the dew-lapp’d beeves their proudest boast,  
Of all their bestial store they valued most.  
By turns the husbands, and the brides, prolong  
The various measures of the rural song.  
Now, to the dance the rustic reeds resound;  
The dancers’ heels, light-quiv’ring, beat the ground;  
And now, the lambs around them bleating stray,  
Feed from their hands, or, round them frisking play.

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

Methought I saw the sylvan reign of Pan,  
And heard the music of the Mantuan swan: <span
id="fr_374"></span>[1](#fn_370)  
With smiles we hail them, and with joy behold  
The blissful manners of the age of gold.  
With that mild kindness, by their looks display’d,  
Fresh stores they bring, with cloth of red repaid;  
Yet, from their lips no word we knew could flow,  
Nor sign of India’s strand their hands bestow.  
Fair blow the winds; again with sails unfurl’d  
We dare the main, and seek the eastern world.  
Now, round black Afric’s coast our navy veer’d,  
And, to the world’s mid circle, northward steer’d:  
The southern pole low to the wave declin’d,  
We leave the isle of Holy Cross <span id="fr_375"></span>[2](#fn_371)
behind:  
That isle where erst a Lusian, when he pass’d  
The tempest-beaten cape, his anchors cast,  
And own’d his proud ambition to explore  
The kingdoms of the morn could dare no more.  
From thence, still on, our daring course we hold  
Thro’ trackless gulfs, whose billows never roll’d  
Around the vessel’s pitchy sides before;  
Thro’ trackless gulfs, where mountain surges roar,  
For many a night, when not a star appear’d,  
Nor infant moon’s dim horns the darkness cheer’d;  
For many a dreary night, and cheerless day,  
In calms now fetter’d, now the whirlwind’s play,  
By ardent hope still fir’d, we forc’d our dreadful way.  
Now, smooth as glass the shining waters lie,  
No cloud, slow moving, sails the azure sky;  
Slack from their height the sails unmov’d decline,  
The airy streamers form the downward line;  
No gentle quiver owns the gentle gale,  
Nor gentlest swell distends the ready sail;  
Fix’d as in ice, the slumb’ring prows remain,  
And silence wide extends her solemn reign.  
Now to the waves the bursting clouds descend,  
And heaven and sea in meeting tempests blend;

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

The black-wing’d whirlwinds o’er the ocean sweep,  
And from his bottom roars the stagg’ring deep.  
Driv’n by the yelling blast’s impetuous sway  
Stagg’ring we bound, yet onward bound away:  
And now, escaped the fury of the storm,  
New danger threatens in a various form;  
Though fresh the breeze the swelling canvas swell’d,  
A current’s headlong sweep our prows withheld:  
The rapid force impress’d on every keel,  
Backward, o’erpower’d, our rolling vessels reel:  
When from their southern caves the winds, enraged,  
In horrid conflict with the waves engaged;  
Beneath the tempest groans each loaded mast,  
And, o’er the rushing tide our bounding navy pass’d. <span
id="fr_376"></span>[1](#fn_372)

  Now shin’d the sacred morn, when from the east  
Three kings <span id="fr_377"></span>[2](#fn_373) the holy cradled Babe
address’d,  
And hail’d him Lord of heaven: that festive day <span
id="fr_378"></span>[3](#fn_374)  
We drop our anchors in an opening bay;  
The river from the sacred day we name, <span
id="fr_379"></span>[4](#fn_375)  
And stores, the wand’ring seaman’s right, we claim:  
Stores we receiv’d; our dearest hope in vain,  
No word they utter’d could our ears retain;  
Nought to reward our search for India’s sound,  
By word or sign our ardent wishes crown’d. <span
id="fr_380"></span>[5](#fn_376)

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

  Behold, O king, how many a shore we tried!  
How many a fierce barbarian’s rage defied!  
Yet still, in vain, for India’s shore we try,  
The long-sought shores our anxious search defy.  
Beneath new heavens, where not a star we knew,  
Through changing climes, where poison’d air we drew;  
Wandering new seas, in gulfs unknown, forlorn,  
By labour weaken’d, and by famine worn;  
Our food corrupted, pregnant with disease,  
And pestilence on each expected breeze;  
Not even a gleam of hope’s delusive ray  
To lead us onward through the devious way--  
That kind delusion <span id="fr_381"></span>[1](#fn_377) which full oft
has cheer’d  
The bravest minds, till glad success appear’d;  
Worn as we were, each night with dreary care,  
Each day, with danger that increas’d despair;  
Oh! monarch, judge, what less than Lusian fire  
Could still the hopeless scorn of fate inspire!  
What less, O king, than Lusian faith withstand,  
When dire despair and famine gave command  
Their chief to murder, and with lawless power  
Sweep Afric’s seas, and every coast devour!  
What more than men in wild despair still bold!  
These, more than men, in these my band behold!  
Sacred to death, by death alone subdued,  
These, all the rage of fierce despair withstood; <span
id="fr_382"></span>[2](#fn_378)

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

Firm to their faith, though fondest hope no more  
Could give the promise of their native shore!

  Now, the sweet waters of the stream we leave,  
And the salt waves our gliding prows receive:  
Here to the left, between the bending shores,  
Torn by the winds the whirling billow roars;  
And boiling raves against the sounding coast,  
Whose mines of gold Sofala’s merchants boast:  
Full to the gulf the show’ry south-winds howl,  
Aslant, against the wind, our vessels roll:  
Far from the land, wide o’er the ocean driv’n,  
Our helms resigning to the care of heav’n,  
By hope and fear’s keen passions toss’d, we roam,  
When our glad eyes beheld the surges foam  
Against the beacons of a cultur’d bay,  
Where sloops and barges cut the wat’ry way.  
The river’s opening breast some upward plied,  
And some came gliding down the sweepy tide.  
Quick throbs of transport heav’d in every heart  
To view the knowledge of the seaman’s art;  
For here, we hop’d our ardent wish to gain,  
To hear of India’s strand, nor hop’d in vain.  
Though Ethiopia’s sable hue they bore  
No look of wild surprise the natives wore:  
Wide o’er their heads the cotton turban swell’d,  
And cloth of blue the decent loins conceal’d.  
Their speech, though rude and dissonant of sound,  
Their speech a mixture of Arabian own’d.  
Fernando, skill’d in all the copious store  
Of fair Arabia’s speech, and flow’ry lore,  
In joyful converse heard the pleasing tale,  
That, o’er these seas, full oft, the frequent sail,  
And lordly vessels, tall as ours, appear’d,  
Which, to the regions of the morning steer’d,  
And, back returning, to the southmost land  
Convey’d the treasures of the Indian strand;

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

Whose cheerful crews, resembling ours, display  
The kindred face and colour of the day. <span
id="fr_383"></span>[1](#fn_379)  
Elate with joy we raise the glad acclaim,  
And, "River of good signs," <span id="fr_384"></span>[2](#fn_380) the
port we name:  
Then, sacred to the angel guide, <span id="fr_385"></span>[3](#fn_381)
who led  
The young Tobiah to the spousal bed,  
And safe return’d him through the perilous way,  
We rear a column <span id="fr_386"></span>[4](#fn_382) on the friendly
bay.

  Our keels, that now had steer’d through many a clime,  
By shell-fish roughen’d, and incased with slime,  
Joyful we clean, while bleating from the field  
The fleecy dams the smiling natives yield:  
But while each face an honest welcome shows,  
And, big with sprightly hope, each bosom glows,  
(Alas! how vain the bloom of human joy!  
How soon the blasts of woe that bloom destroy!)  
A dread disease its rankling horrors shed,  
And death’s dire ravage through mine army spread.  
Never mine eyes such dreary sight beheld,  
Ghastly the mouth and gums enormous swell’d; <span
id="fr_387"></span>[5](#fn_383)  
And instant, putrid like a dead man’s wound,  
Poisoned with fœtid steams the air around.  
No sage physician’s ever-watchful zeal,  
No skilful surgeon’s gentle hand to heal,  
Were found: each dreary mournful hour we gave  
Some brave companion to a foreign grave.

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

A grave, the awful gift of every shore!------  
Alas! what weary toils with us they bore!  
Long, long endear’d by fellowship in woe,  
O’er their cold dust we give the tears to flow;  
And, in their hapless lot forbode our own,  
A foreign burial, and a grave unknown!

  Now, deeply yearning o’er our deathful fate,  
With joyful hope of India’s shore elate,  
We loose the hawsers and the sail expand,  
And, upward coast the Ethiopian strand.  
What danger threaten’d at Quiloa’s isle,  
Mozambique’s treason, and Mombassa’s guile:  
What miracles kind Heav’n our guardian wrought,  
Loud fame already to thine ears has brought:  
Kind Heaven again that guardian care display’d,  
And, to thy port our weary fleet convey’d,  
Where thou, O king, Heaven’s regent power below,  
Bidd’st thy full bounty and thy truth to flow;  
Health to the sick, and to the weary rest,  
And sprightly hope reviv’d in every breast,  
Proclaim thy gifts, with grateful joy repaid,  
The brave man’s tribute for the brave man’s aid.  
And now, in honour of thy fond command,  
The glorious annals of my native land;  
And what the perils of a route so bold,  
So dread as ours, my faithful lips have told.  
Then judge, great monarch, if the world before  
Ere saw the prow such length of seas explore!  
Nor sage Ulysses, <span id="fr_388"></span>[1](#fn_384) nor the
Trojan <span id="fr_389"></span>[2](#fn_385) pride  
Such raging gulfs, such whirling storms defied;  
Nor one poor tenth of my dread course explor’d,  
Though by the muse as demigods ador’d.

  O thou whose breast all Helicon inflam’d, <span
id="fr_390"></span>[3](#fn_386)  
Whose birth seven vaunting cities proudly claim’d  
And thou whose mellow lute and rural song, <span
id="fr_391"></span>[4](#fn_387)  
In softest flow, led Mincio’s waves along,  
Whose warlike numbers, as a storm impell’d,  
And Tiber’s surges o’er his borders swell’d;

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

Let all Parnassus lend creative fire,  
And all the Nine <span id="fr_392"></span>[1](#fn_388) with all their
warmth inspire;  
Your demigods conduct through every scene  
Cold fear can paint, or wildest fancy feign;  
The Syren’s guileful lay, dire Circe’s spell, <span
id="fr_393"></span>[2](#fn_389)  
And all the horrors of the Cyclop’s cell; <span
id="fr_394"></span>[3](#fn_390)  
Bid Scylla’s barking waves their mates o’erwhelm  
And hurl the guardian pilot from the helm, <span
id="fr_395"></span>[4](#fn_391)  
Give sails and oars to fly the purple shore,  
Where love of absent friend awakes no more; <span
id="fr_396"></span>[5](#fn_392)  
In all their charms display Calypso’s smiles,  
Her flow’ry arbours and her am’rous wiles;  
In skins confin’d the blust’ring winds control, <span
id="fr_397"></span>[6](#fn_393)

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

Or, o’er the feast bid loathsome harpies <span
id="fr_398"></span>[1](#fn_394) prowl;  
And lead your heroes through the dread abodes  
Of tortur’d spectres and infernal <span id="fr_399"></span>[2](#fn_395)
gods;  
Give ev’ry flow’r that decks Aonia’s hill  
To grace your fables with divinest skill;  
Beneath the wonders of my tale they fall,  
Where truth, all unadorn’d and pure, exceeds them all.------

  While thus, illustrious GAMA charm’d their ears,  
The look of wonder each Melindian wears,  
And pleased attention witness’d the command  
Of every movement of his lips, or hand.  
The king, enraptur’d, own’d the glorious fame  
Of Lisbon’s monarchs and the Lusian name;  
What warlike rage the victor-kings inspir’d!  
Nor less their warriors’ loyal faith admir’d.  
Nor less his menial train, in wonder lost,  
Repeat the gallant deeds that please them most,  
Each to his mate; while, fix’d in fond amaze,  
The Lusian features every eye surveys;  
While, present to the view, by fancy brought,  
Arise the wonders by the Lusians wrought,  
And each bold feature to their wond’ring sight  
Displays the raptur’d ardour of the fight.

  Apollo now withdrew the cheerful day,  
And left the western sky to twilight grey;  
Beneath the wave he sought fair Thetis’ bed,  
And, to the shore Melinda’s sov’reign sped.

  What boundless joys are thine, O just Renown,  
Thou hope of Virtue, and her noblest crown!

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

By thee the seeds of conscious worth are fir’d,  
Hero by hero, fame by fame inspir’d:  
Without thine aid how soon the hero dies!  
By thee upborne, his name ascends the skies.  
This Ammon <span id="fr_400"></span>[1](#fn_396) knew, and own’d his
Homer’s lyre  
The noblest glory of Pelides’ ire. <span
id="fr_401"></span>[2](#fn_397)  
This knew Augustus, and from Mantua’s shade  
To courtly ease the Roman bard convey’d; <span
id="fr_402"></span>[3](#fn_398)  
And soon exulting flow’d the song divine,  
The noblest glory of the Roman line.  
Dear was the Muse to Julius; ever dear  
To Scipio, though the pond’rous, conquering spear  
Roughen’d his hand, th’ immortal pen he knew,  
And, to the tented field the gentle Muses drew.  
Each glorious chief of Greek or Latian line,  
Or barb’rous race, adorn’d the Aonian shrine;  
Each glorious name, ever to the Muse endear’d.  
Or woo’d the Muses, or, the Muse rever’d.  
Alas, on Tago’s hapless shores alone  
The Muse is slighted, and her charms unknown;  
For this, no Virgil here attunes the lyre,  
No Homer here awakes the hero’s fire.  
On Tago’s shores are Scipios, Cæsars born,  
And Alexanders Lisbon’s clime adorn;  
But, Heaven has stamp’d them in a rougher mould,  
Nor gave the polish to their genuine gold.  
Careless and rude, or to be known or know,  
In vain, to them, the sweetest numbers flow:  
Unheard, in vain their native poet sings,  
And cold neglect weighs down the Muse’s wings,  
Ev’n he whose veins the blood of GAMA warms, <span
id="fr_403"></span>[4](#fn_399)  
Walks by, unconscious of the Muse’s charms:  
For him no Muse shall leave her golden loom,  
No palm shall blossom, and no wreath shall bloom:  
Yet, shall my labours and my cares be paid  
By fame immortal, and by GAMA’S shade:

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

Him shall the song on ev’ry shore proclaim,  
The first of heroes, first of naval fame.  
Rude, and ungrateful, though my country be,  
This proud example shall be taught by me-  
"Where’er the hero’s worth demands the skies,  
To crown that worth some gen’rous bard shall rise!"

Jalofo lies between the two rivers, the Gambia and the Zanago. The
latter has other names in the several countries through which it runs.
In its course it makes many islands, inhabited only by wild beasts. It
is navigable for 150 leagues, at the end of which it is crossed by a
stupendous ridge of perpendicular rocks, over which the river rushes
with such violence, that travellers pass under it without any other
inconvenience than the prodigious noise. The Gambia, or *Rio Grande*,
runs 180 leagues, but is not so <span id="page_136">p. 136</span> far
navigable. It carries more water, and runs with less noise than the
other, though filled with many rivers which water the country of
Mandinga. Both rivers are branches of the Niger. Their waters have this
remarkable quality; when mixed together they operate as an emetic, but
when separate do not. They abound with great variety of fishes, and
their banks are covered with horses, crocodiles, winged serpents,
elephants, ounces, wild boars, with great numbers of others, wonderful
for the variety of their nature and different forms.--FARIA Y SOUSA.

<span id="fn_349"></span>[136:5](lusbk05.htm#fr_353) During the reign of
John II. the Portuguese erected several forts, and acquired great power
in the extensive regions of Guinea, Azambuja, a Portuguese captain,
having obtained leave from Caramansa, a negro prince, to erect a fort on
his territories, an unlucky accident had almost proved. fatal to the
discoverers. A huge rock lay very commodious for a quarry; the workmen
began on it; but this rock, as the <span id="page_137">p. 137</span>
devil would have it, happened to be a negro god. The Portuguese were
driven away by the enraged worshippers, who were afterwards with
difficulty pacified by a profusion of such presents as they most
esteemed.

<span id="fn_350"></span>[137:1](lusbk05.htm#fr_354) The Portuguese,
having brought an ambassador from Congo to Lisbon, sent him back
instructed in the faith. By this means the king, queen, and about
100,000 of the people were baptized; the idols were destroyed and
churches built. Soon after, the prince, who was then absent at war, was
baptized by the name of *Alonzo*. His younger brother, Aquitimo,
however, would not receive the faith, and the father, because allowed
only one wife, turned apostate, and left the crown to his pagan son,
who, with a great army, surrounded his brother, when only attended by
some Portuguese and Christian blacks, in all only thirty-seven. By the
bravery of these, however, Aquitimo was defeated, taken, and slain. One
of Aquitimo’s officers declared, they were not defeated by the
thirty-seven Christians, but by a glorious army who fought under a
shining cross. The idols were again destroyed, and Alonzo sent his sons,
grandsons, and nephews to Portugal to study; two of whom were afterwards
bishops in Congo.--*Extracted from* Faria y Sousa.

<span id="fn_351"></span>[137:2](lusbk05.htm#fr_355) According to fable,
Calisto was a nymph of Diana. Jupiter having assumed the figure of that
goddess, completed his amorous desires. On the discovery of her
pregnancy, Diana drove her from her train. <span id="page_138">p.
138</span> She fled to the woods, where she was delivered of a son. Juno
changed them into bears, and Jupiter placed them in heaven, where they
form the constellations of Ursa Major and Minor. Juno, still enraged,
entreated Thetis never to suffer Calisto to bathe in the sea. This is
founded on the appearance of the northern pole-star, to the inhabitants
of our hemisphere; but, when GAMA approached the austral pole, the
northern, of consequence, disappeared under the waves.

<span id="fn_353"></span>[138:2](lusbk05.htm#fr_357) The constellation
of the southern pole was called *The Cross* by the Portuguese sailors,
from the appearance of that figure formed by seven stars. In the
southern hemisphere, as Camoëns observes, the nights are darker than in
the northern, the skies being adorned with much fewer stars.

<span id="fn_355"></span>[139:2](lusbk05.htm#fr_359) *That living fire,
by seamen held divine*.--The sulphureous vapours of the air, after being
violently agitated by a tempest, unite, and when the humidity begins to
subside, as is the case when the storm is almost exhausted, by the
agitation of their atoms they take fire, and are attracted by the masts
and cordage of the ship. Being thus, naturally, the pledges of the
approaching calm, it is no wonder that the superstition of sailors
should in all ages have esteemed them divine, and--

*Of heaven’s own care in storms the holy sign*.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In the expedition
of the Golden Fleece, in a violent tempest these fires were seen to
hover over the heads of Castor and Pollux, who were two of the
Argonauts, and a calm immediately ensued. After the apotheoses of these
heroes, the Grecian sailors invoked these fires by the names of Castor
and Pollux, or *the sons of Jupiter*. The Athenians called them Σωτῆρες,
*Saviours*.

<span id="fn_356"></span>[140:1](lusbk05.htm#fr_360) In this book,
particularly in the description of Massilia, the Gorgades, the fires
called Castor and Pollux, and the water-spout, Camoëns has happily
imitated the manner of Lucan. It is probable that Camoëns, in his voyage
to the East Indies, was an eye witness of the phenomena of the fires and
water-spout. The latter is thus described by Pliny, l. 2. c. 51. *Fit et
caligo, belluæ similis nubes dira navigantibus vocatur et columna, cum
spissatus humor rigensque ipse se sustinet, et in longam veluti fistulam
nubes aquam trahit*. When the violent heat attracts the waters to rise
in the form of a tube, the marine salts are left behind, by the action
of rarefaction, being too gross and fixed to ascend. It is thus, when
the overloaded vapour bursts, that it descends--

*Sweet as the waters of the limpid rill*.

<span id="fn_357"></span>[141:1](lusbk05.htm#fr_361) *That sage
device*.--The astrolabe, an instrument of infinite service in
navigation, by which the altitude of the sun, and distance of the stars
is taken. It was invented in Portugal during the reign of John II. by
two Jewish physicians, named Roderic and Joseph. It is asserted by some
that they were assisted by Martin of Bohemia, a celebrated
mathematician. *Partly from* Castera. Vid. Barros, Dec. 1. lib. iv. c.

<span id="fn_359"></span>[143:1](lusbk05.htm#fr_363) Camoëns, in
describing the adventure of Fernando Velosó, by departing from the truth
of history, has shown his judgment as a poet. The place where the
Portuguese landed they named the Bay of St. Helen. They caught one of
two negroes, says Faria, who were busied in gathering honey on a
mountain. Their behaviour to this savage, whom they gratified with a red
cap, some glasses and bells, induced him to bring a number of his
companions for the like trifles. Though some who accompanied GAMA were
skilled in the various African languages, not one of the natives could
understand them. A commerce, however, was commenced by signs and
gestures. GAMA behaved to them with great civility; the fleet was
cheerfully supplied with fresh provisions, for which the natives
received cloths and trinkets. But this friendship was soon interrupted
by a young, rash Portuguese. Having contracted an intimacy with some of
the negroes, he obtained leave to penetrate into the country along with
them, to observe their habitations and strength. They conducted him to
their huts with great good nature, and placed before him, what they
esteemed an elegant repast, a sea-calf dressed in the way of their
country. This so much disgusted the delicate Portuguese, that he
instantly got up and abruptly left them. Nor did they oppose his
departure, but accompanied him with the greatest innocence. As fear,
however, is always jealous, he imagined they were leading him as a
victim to slaughter. No sooner did he come near the ships, than he
called aloud for assistance. Coëllo’s boat immediately set off for his
rescue. The Africans fled to the woods; and now esteeming the Portuguese
as a band of lawless plunderers, they provided themselves with arms, and
lay in ambush. Their weapons were javelins, headed with short pieces of
horn, which they throw with great dexterity. Soon after, while GAMA and
some of his officers were on the shore taking the altitude of the sun by
the astrolabe, they were suddenly and with great fury attacked by the
ambush from the woods. Several were much wounded, *multos convulnerant,
inter quos Gama in pede vulnus accepit*, and GAMA received a wound in
the foot. The admiral made a speedy retreat to the fleet, prudently
choosing rather to leave the negroes the honour of the victory, than to
risk the life of one man in a quarrel so foreign to the destination of
his expedition, and where, to impress the terror of his arms could be of
no service to his interest. When he came nearer to the East Indies he
acted in a different manner. He then made himself dreaded whenever the
treachery of the natives provoked his resentment.--*Collected from*
Faria and Osorius.

<span id="fn_360"></span>[144:1](lusbk05.htm#fr_364) The critics have
vehemently declaimed against the least mixture of the comic, with the
dignity of the epic poem. It is needless to enter into any defence of
this passage of Camoëns, farther than to observe that Homer, Virgil, and
Milton have offended the critics in the same manner, and that this piece
of raillery in the Lusiad is by much the politest, and the least
reprehensible, of anything of the kind in the four poets. In Homer are
several strokes of low raillery. Patroclus having killed Hector’s
charioteer, puns thus on his sudden fall: *It is a pity he is not nearer
the sea! He would soon catch abundance of oysters, nor would the storms
frighten him. See how he dives from his chariot down to the sand! What
excellent divers are the Trojans!* Virgil, the most judicious of all
poets, descends even to burlesque, where the commander of a galley
tumbles the pilot into the sea:--

------------------*Segnemque Menœten  
In mare præcipitem puppi deturbat ab alta.  
At gravis ut sundo vix tandem redditus imo est  
Jam senior, madidaque fluens in veste Menœtes,  
Summa petit scopuli siccaque in rupe resedit.  
Ilium et labentem Teucri, et risere natantem;  
Et salsos rident revomentem pectore fluctus*.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And, though the
character of the speakers, the ingenious defence which has been offered
for Milton, may, in some measure, vindicate the raillery which he puts
into the mouths of Satan and Belial, the lowness of it, when compared
with that of Camoëns, must still be acknowledged. Talking of the
execution of the diabolical artillery among the good angels, they, says
Satan--

"Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell  
As they would dance, yet for a dance they seem’d  
Somewhat extravagant and wild, perhaps  
For joy offer’d peace.------

To whom thus Belial, in like gamesome mood.  
Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight,  
Of hard contents, and full of force urg’d home,  
Such as we might perceive amus’d them all,  
And stumbled many------  
-----------------------this gift they have beside,  
They show us when our foes walk not upright."

<span id="fn_361"></span>[146:1](lusbk05.htm#fr_365) The translator in
reply to the critics will venture the assertion, that the fiction of the
apparition of the Cape of Tempests, in sublimity and awful grandeur of
imagination, stands unsurpassed in human composition.

<span id="fn_362"></span>[147:1](lusbk05.htm#fr_366) *The next proud
fleet*.--On the return of GAMA to Portugal, a fleet of thirteen sail,
under the command of Pedro Alvarez Cabral, was sent out on the second
voyage to India, where the admiral with only six ships arrived. The rest
were mostly destroyed by a terrible tempest at the Cape of Good Hope,
which lasted twenty days. "The daytime," says Faria, "was so dark that
the sailors could scarcely see each other, or hear what was said for the
horrid noise of the winds. Among those who perished was the celebrated
Bartholomew Diaz, who was the first modern discoverer of the Cape of
Good Hope, which he named the Cape of Tempests."

<span id="fn_363"></span>[147:2](lusbk05.htm#fr_367) *Behold a hero
come*.--Don Francisco de Almeyda. He was the first Portuguese viceroy of
India, in which country he obtained several great victories over the
Mohammedans and pagans. He was the first who conquered Quiloa and
Mombas, or Mombaz. On his return to Portugal he put into the bay of
Saldanha, near the Cape of Good Hope, to take in water and provisions.
The rudeness of one of his servants produced a quarrel with the Caffres,
or Hottentots. His attendants, much against his will, forced him to
march against the blacks. "Ah, whither," he exclaimed, "will you carry
the infirm man of sixty years?" After plundering a miserable village, on
the return to their ships they were attacked by a superior number of
Caffres, who fought with such fury in rescue of their, children, whom
the Portuguese had seized, that the viceroy and fifty of his attendants
were slain.

<span id="fn_365"></span>[148:1](lusbk05.htm#fr_369) This poetical
description of the miserable catastrophe of Don Emmanuel de Souza, and
his beautiful spouse, Leonora de Sà, is by no means exaggerated. He was
several years governor of Diu in India, where he amassed immense wealth.
On his return to his native country, the ship in which was his lady, all
his riches, and five hundred men, his sailors and domestics, was dashed
to pieces on the rocks at the Cape of Good Hope. Don Emmanuel, his lady,
and three children, with four hundred of the crew escaped, having only
saved a few arms and provisions. As they marched through the wild
uncultivated deserts, some died of famine, of thirst, and fatigue;
others, who wandered from the main body in search of water, were <span
id="page_149">p. 149</span> murdered by the savages, or destroyed by the
wild beasts. They arrived, at last, at a village inhabited by African
banditti. At first they were courteously received, but the barbarians,
having unexpectedly seized their arms, stripped the whole company naked,
and left them destitute to the mercy of the desert. The wretchedness of
the delicate and exposed Leonora was increased by the brutal insults of
the negroes. Her husband, unable to relieve, beheld her miseries. After
having travelled about 300 leagues, her legs swelled, her feet bleeding
at every step, and her strength exhausted, she sunk down, and with the
sand covered herself to the neck, to conceal her nakedness. In this
dreadful situation, she beheld two of her children expire. Her own death
soon followed. Her husband, who had been long enamoured of her beauty,
received her last breath in a distracted embrace. Immediately, he
snatched his third child in his arms, and uttering the most lamentable
cries, he ran into the thickest of the wood, where the wild beasts were
soon heard to growl over their prey. Of the whole four hundred who
escaped the waves, only six and twenty arrived at another village, whose
inhabitants were more civilized, and traded with the merchants of the
Red Sea, from whence they found a passage to Europe, and brought the
tidings of the unhappy fate of their companions. Jerome de Cortereal, a
Portuguese poet, has written an affecting poem on the shipwreck, and
deplorable catastrophe of Don Emmanuel, and his beloved spouse.--*Partly

<span id="fn_369"></span>[153:1](lusbk05.htm#fr_373) *And give our
wearied minds a lively glow*.--Variety is no less delightful to the
reader than to the traveller, and the imagination of Camoëns gave an
abundant supply. The insertion of this pastoral landscape, between the
terrific scenes which precede and follow, has a fine effect. "Variety,"
says Pope, in one of his notes on the Odyssey, "gives life and delight;
and it is much more necessary in epic, than in comic or tragic, poetry,
sometimes to shift the scenes, to diversify and embellish the story."

The Portuguese, sailing upon the Atlantic Ocean, discovered the most
southern point of Africa: here they found an immense sea, which carried
them to the East Indies. The dangers they encountered in the voyage, the
discovery of Mozambique, of Melinda, and of Calecut, have been sung by
Camoëns, whose poem recalls to our minds the charms of the Odyssey, and
the magnificence of the Æneid.--MONTESQUIEU, Spirit of Laws, bk. xxi. c.

<span id="fn_372"></span>[155:1](lusbk05.htm#fr_376) It was the force of
this rushing current which retarded the further discoveries of Diaz.

<span id="fn_376"></span>[155:5](lusbk05.htm#fr_380) The frequent
disappointments of the Portuguese, when they expect to hear some account
of India, is a judicious imitation of several parts of Virgil; who, in
the same manner, magnifies the distresses of the Trojans in their search
for the fated seat of Empire:--

        -----------------*O gens  
Infelix! cui to exitio fortuna reservat?  
Septima post Trojæ excidium jam vertitur æstas;  
Cum freta, cum terras omnes, tot inhospita saxa  
Sideraque emensæ ferimur: dum per mare magnum

<span id="fn_378"></span>[156:2](lusbk05.htm#fr_382) It had been
extremely impolitic in GAMA to mention the mutiny of his followers to
the King of Melinda. The boast of their loyalty, besides, has a good
effect in the poem, as it elevates the heroes, and gives uniformity to
the character of bravery, which the dignity of the epopea required to be
ascribed to them. History relates the matter differently. In standing
for the Cape of Good Hope, GAMA gave the highest proofs of his
resolution. The fleet seemed now tossed to the clouds, *ut modo nubes
contingere*, and now sunk to the lowest whirlpools of the abyss. The
winds were insufferably cold, and, to the rage of the tempest was added
the horror of an almost continual darkness. The crew expected every
moment to be swallowed up in the deep. At every interval of the storm,
they came round GAMA, asserting the impossibility to proceed further,
and imploring hint to return. This he resolutely refused. A conspiracy
against his life was formed, but was discovered by his brother. He
guarded against it with the greatest courage and prudence; put all the
pilots in chains, and he himself, with some others, took the management
of the helms. At last, after <span id="page_157">p. 157</span> having
many days withstood the tempest, and a perfidious conspiracy, *invicto
animo*, with an unconquered mind, a favourable change of weather revived
the spirits of the fleet, and allowed them to double the Cape of Good
Hope.--*Extr. from* Osorius’s Historia.

<span id="fn_379"></span>[158:1](lusbk05.htm#fr_383) GAMA and his
followers were, from the darkness of the Portuguese complexion, thought
to be Moors. When GAMA arrived in the East, a considerable commerce was
carried on between the Indies and the Red Sea by the Moorish traders, by
whom the gold mines of Sofala, and the riches of East Africa were
enjoyed. The traffic was brought by land to Cairo, from whence Europe
was supplied by the Venetian and Antwerpian merchants.

<span id="fn_382"></span>[158:4](lusbk05.htm#fr_386) It was the custom
of the Portuguese navigators to erect crosses on the shores of
new-discovered countries. GAMA carried materials for pillars of stone
with him, and erected six crosses during his expedition. They bore the
name and arms of the king of Portugal, and were intended as proofs of
the title which accrues from first discovery.

named from the lotus, are thus described by Homer:--

"Not prone to ill, nor strange to foreign guest,  
They eat, they drink, and Nature gives the feast;  
The trees around them all their fruit produce;  
Lotos the name; divine, nectareous juice;  
(Thence call’d Lotophagi) which whoso tastes,  
Insatiate, riots in the sweet repasts,  
Nor other home, nor other care intends,  
But quits his home, his country, and his friends:  
The three we sent, from off th’ enchanting ground  
We dragg’d reluctant, and by force we bound:  
The rest in haste forsook the pleasing shore,  
Or, the charm tasted, had return’d no more."  
                                       POPE, Odyss. ix. 103.

The Libyan lotus is a shrub like a bramble, the berries like the myrtle,
purple when ripe, and about the size of an olive. Mixed with bread-corn,
it was used as food for slaves. They also made an agreeable wine of it,
but which would not keep above ten days. See Pope’s note *in loco*.

Compress’d their force, and lock’d each struggling blast:  
For him the mighty sire of gods assign’d,  
The tempest’s lord, the tyrant of the wind;  
His word alone the list’ning storms obey,  
To smooth the deep, or swell the foamy sea.  
These, in my hollow ship the monarch hung,  
Securely fetter’d by a silver thong; <span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

Rare gift! but oh, what gift to fools avails?"  
                                       POPE, Odyss. x. 20.

The companions of Ulysses imagined that these bags contained some
valuable treasure, and opened them while their leader slept. The
tempests bursting out, drove the fleet from Ithaca, which was then in
sight, and was the cause of a new train of miseries.
