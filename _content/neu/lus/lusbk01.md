# THE LUSIAD. <span id="fr_61"></span>[1](#fn_61)

### BOOK I.

#### ARGUMENT.

Statement of the subject. Invocation to the muses of the Tagus. Herald
calls an assembly of the gods. Jupiter foretells the future conquests of
the Portuguese. Bacchus, apprehensive that the Portuguese may eclipse
the glory acquired by himself in the conquest of India, declares against
them. Venus, who sees in the Portuguese her ancient Romans, promises to
aid their enterprise. Mars induces Jupiter to support them, and Mercury
is sent to direct their course. Gama, commander of the expedition, lands
at Mozambique and Mombas. Opposition of the Moors, instigated by 
Bacchus. They grant Gama a pilot who designs treacherously to take them
to Quiloa to ensure the destruction of the whole expedition.

ARMS and the Heroes, who from Lisbon’s shore,  
Thro’ seas <span id="fr_62"></span>[2](#fn_62) where sail was never
spread before,  
Beyond where Ceylon lifts her spicy breast,  
And waves her woods above the wat’ry waste,

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

With prowess more than human forc’d their way  
To the fair kingdoms of the rising day:  
What wars they wag’d, what seas, what dangers pass’d,  
What glorious empire crown’d their toils at last,  
Vent’rous I sing, on soaring pinions borne,  
And all my country’s wars <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63) the song
adorn;  
What kings, what heroes of my native land  
Thunder’d on Asia’s and on Afric’s strand:  
Illustrious shades, who levell’d in the dust  
The idol-temples and the shrines of lust:  
And where, erewhile, foul demons were rever’d,  
To Holy Faith unnumber’d altars rear’d: <span
id="fr_64"></span>[2](#fn_64)  
Illustrious names, with deathless laurels crown’d,  
While time rolls on in every clime renown’d!

  Let Fame with wonder name the Greek <span
id="fr_65"></span>[3](#fn_65) no more,  
What lands he saw, what toils at sea he bore;  
Nor more the Trojan’s wand’ring <span id="fr_66"></span>[4](#fn_66)
voyage boast,  
What storms he brav’d on many a perilous coast:  
No more let Rome exult in Trajan’s name,  
Nor Eastern conquests Ammon’s <span id="fr_67"></span>[5](#fn_67) pride
proclaim;  
A nobler hero’s deeds demand my lays  
Than e’er adorn’d the song of ancient days,  
Illustrious GAMA, <span id="fr_68"></span>[6](#fn_68) whom the waves
obey’d,  
And whose dread sword the fate of empire sway’d.

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

And you, fair nymphs of Tagus, parent stream,  
If e’er your meadows were my pastoral theme,  
While you have listen’d, and by moonshine seen  
My footsteps wander o’er your banks of green,  
O come auspicious, and the song inspire  
With all the boldness of your hero’s fire:  
Deep and majestic let the numbers flow,  
And, rapt to heaven, with ardent fury glow,  
Unlike the verse that speaks the lover’s grief,  
When heaving sighs afford their soft relief,  
And humble reeds bewail the shepherd’s pain;  
But like the warlike trumpet be the strain  
To rouse the hero’s ire, and far around,  
With equal rage, your warriors’ deeds resound.

  And thou, <span id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_69) O born the pledge of
happier days,  
To guard our freedom and our glories raise,

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

Given to the world to spread Religion’s sway,  
And pour o’er many a land the mental day,  
Thy future honours on thy shield behold,  
The cross and victor’s wreath emboss’d in gold:  
At thy commanding frown we trust to see,  
The Turk and Arab bend the suppliant knee:  
Beneath the morn, <span id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_70) dread king, thine
empire lies,  
When midnight veils thy Lusitanian <span id="fr_71"></span>[2](#fn_71)
skies;

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

And when, descending in the western main,  
The sun <span id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_72) still rises on thy
length’ning reign:  
Thou blooming scion of the noblest stem,  
Our nation’s safety, and our age’s gem,  
O young Sebastian, hasten to the prime  
Of manly youth, to Fame’s high temple climb:  
Yet now attentive hear the Muse’s lay  
While thy green years to manhood speed away:  
The youthful terrors of thy brow suspend,  
And, oh, propitious to the song attend--  
The num’rous song, by patriot-passion fir’d,  
And by the glories of thy race inspir’d:  
To be the herald of my country’s fame  
My first ambition and my dearest aim:  
Nor conquests fabulous nor actions vain,  
The Muse’s pastime, here adorn the strain:  
Orlando’s fury, and Rugero’s rage,  
And all the heroes of th’ Aonian page, <span
id="fr_73"></span>[2](#fn_73)  
The dreams of bards surpass’d the world shall view,  
And own their boldest fictions may be true;  
Surpass’d and dimm’d by the superior blaze  
Of GAMA’S mighty deeds, which here bright Truth displays.  
Nor more let History boast her heroes old,  
Their glorious rivals here, dread prince, behold:  
Here shine the valiant Nunio’s deeds unfeign’d,  
Whose single arm the falling state sustain’d;

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

Here fearless Egas’ wars, and, Fuas, thine,  
To give full ardour to the song combine;  
But ardour equal to your martial ire  
Demands the thund’ring sounds of Homer’s lyre.  
To match the Twelve so long by bards renown’d, <span
id="fr_74"></span>[1](#fn_74)  
Here brave Magricio and his peers are crown’d  
(A glorious Twelve!) with deathless laurels, won  
In gallant arms before the English throne.  
Unmatch’d no more the Gallic Charles shall stand,  
Nor Caesar’s name the first of praise command:  
Of nobler acts the crown’d Alonzo <span id="fr_75"></span>[2](#fn_75)
see,  
Thy valiant sires, to whom the bended knee  
Of vanquish’d Afric bow’d. Nor less in fame,  
He who confin’d the rage of civil flame,  
The godlike John, beneath whose awful sword  
Rebellion crouch’d, and trembling own’d him lord  
Those heroes, too, who thy bold flag unfurl’d,  
And spread thy banners o’er the Eastern world,  
Whose spears subdu’d the kingdoms of the morn,  
Their names and glorious wars the song adorn:  
The daring GAMA, whose unequall’d name  
(Proud monarch) shines o’er all of naval fame:  
Castro the bold, in arms a peerless knight,  
And stern Pacheco, dreadful in the fight:  
The two Almeydas, names for ever dear,  
By Tago’s nymphs embalm’d with many a tear;  
Ah, still their early fate the nymphs shall mourn,  
And bathe with many a tear their hapless urn:  
Nor shall the godlike Albuquerque restrain  
The Muse’s fury; o’er the purpled plain  
The Muse shall lead him in his thund’ring car  
Amidst his glorious brothers of the war,  
Whose fame in arms resounds from sky to sky,  
And bids their deeds the power of death defy.  
And while, to thee, I tune the duteous lay,  
Assume, O potent king, thine empire’s sway;

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

With thy brave host through Afric march along,  
And give new triumphs to immortal song:  
On thee with earnest eyes the nations wait,  
And, cold with dread, the Moor expects his fate;  
The barb’rous mountaineer on Taurus’ brows  
To thy expected yoke his shoulder bows;  
Fair Thetis woos thee with her blue domain,  
Her nuptial son, and fondly yields her reign,  
And from the bow’rs of heav’n thy grandsires <span
id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_76) see  
Their various virtues bloom afresh in thee;  
One for the joyful days of peace renown’d,  
And one with war’s triumphant laurels crown’d:  
With joyful hands, to deck thy manly brow,  
They twine the laurel and the olive-bough;  
With joyful eyes a glorious throne they see,  
In Fame’s eternal dome, reserv’d for thee.  
Yet, while thy youthful hand delays to wield  
The sceptre’d power, or thunder of the field,  
Here view thine Argonauts, in seas unknown,  
And all the terrors of the burning zone,  
Till their proud standards, rear’d in other skies,  
And all their conquests meet thy wond’ring <span
id="fr_77"></span>[2](#fn_77) eyes.

  Now, far from land, o’er Neptune’s dread abode  
The Lusitanian fleet triumphant rode;  
Onward they traced the wide and lonesome main,  
Where changeful Proteus leads his scaly train;  
The dancing vanes before the zephyrs flow’d,  
And their bold keels the trackless ocean plough’d;  
Unplough’d before, the green-ting’d billows rose,  
And curl’d and whiten’d round the nodding prows.

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

When Jove, the god who with a thought controls  
The raging seas, and balances the poles,  
From heav’n beheld, and will’d, in sov’reign state,  
To fix the Eastern World’s depending fate,  
Swift at his nod th’ Olympian herald flies,  
And calls th’ immortal senate of the skies;  
Where, from the sov’reign throne of earth and heav’n,  
Th’ immutable decrees of fate are given.  
Instant the regents of the spheres of light,  
And those who rule the paler orbs of night,  
With those, the gods whose delegated sway  
The burning South and frozen North obey;  
And they whose empires see the day-star rise,  
And evening Phoebus leave the western skies,  
All instant pour’d along the milky road,  
Heaven’s crystal pavements glitt’ring as they trod:  
And now, obedient to the dread command,  
Before their awful lord in order stand.

  Sublime and dreadful on his regal throne,  
That glow’d with stars, and bright as lightning shone,  
Th’ immortal Sire, who darts the thunder, sat,  
The crown and sceptre added solemn state;  
The crown, of heaven’s own pearls, whose ardent rays,  
Flam’d round his brows, outshone the diamond’s blaze:  
His breath such gales of vital fragrance shed,  
As might, with sudden life, inspire the dead:  
Supreme Control thron’d in his awful eyes  
Appear’d, and mark’d the monarch of the skies.  
On seats that burn’d with pearl and ruddy gold,  
The subject gods their sov’reign lord enfold,  
Each in his rank, when with a voice that shook  
The tow’rs of heav’n, the world’s dread ruler spoke:

  "Immortal heirs of light, my purpose hear,  
My counsels ponder, and the Fates revere:  
Unless Oblivion o’er your minds has thrown  
Her dark blank shades, to you, ye gods, are known  
The Fate’s decree, and ancient warlike fame  
Of that bold race which boasts of Lusus’ name;  
That bold advent’rous race, the Fates declare,  
A potent empire in the East shall rear,

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

Surpassing Babel’s or the Persian fame,  
Proud Grecia’s boast, or Rome’s illustrious name.  
Oft from these brilliant seats have you beheld  
The sons of Lusus on the dusty field,  
Though few, triumphant o’er the num’rous Moors,  
Till, from the beauteous lawns on Tagus’ shores  
They drove the cruel foe. And oft has heav’n  
Before their troops the proud Castilians driv’n;  
While Victory her eagle-wings display’d  
Where’er their warriors wav’d the shining blade,  
Nor rests unknown how Lusus’ heroes stood  
When Rome’s ambition dyed the world with blood;  
What glorious laurels Viriatus <span id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_78)
gain’d,  
How oft his sword with Roman gore was stain’d;

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

And what fair palms their martial ardour crown’d,  
When led to battle by the chief renown’d,  
Who <span id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_79) feign’d a dæmon, in a deer
conceal’d,  
To him the counsels of the gods reveal’d.  
And now, ambitious to extend their sway  
Beyond their conquests on the southmost bay  
Of Afric’s swarthy coast, on floating wood  
They brave the terrors of the dreary flood,  
Where only black-wing’d mists have hover’d o’er,  
Or driving clouds have sail’d the wave before;  
Beneath new skies they hold their dreadful way  
To reach the cradle of the new-born day:  
And. Fate, whose mandates unrevok’d remain,  
Has will’d that long shall Lusus’ offspring reign  
The lords of that wide sea, whose waves behold  
The sun come forth enthron’d in burning gold.  
But now, the tedious length of winter past,  
Distress’d and weak, the heroes faint at last.  
What gulfs they dar’d, you saw, what storms they brav’d,  
Beneath what various heav’ns their banners wav’d!  
Now Mercy pleads, and soon the rising land  
To their glad eyes shall o’er the waves expand;  
As welcome friends the natives shall receive,  
With bounty feast them, and with joy relieve.  
And, when refreshment shall their strength renew,  
Thence shall they turn, and their bold route pursue."

  So spoke high Jove: the gods in silence heard,  
Then rising, each by turns his thoughts preferr’d  
But chief was Bacchus of the adverse train;  
Fearful he was, nor fear’d his pride in vain,  
Should Lusus’ race arrive on India’s shore,  
His ancient honours would be known no more;

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

No more in Nysa <span id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_80) should the native
tell  
What kings, what mighty hosts before him fell.  
The fertile vales beneath the rising sun  
He view’d as his, by right of victory won,  
And deem’d that ever in immortal song  
The Conqueror’s title should to him belong.  
Yet Fate, he knew, had will’d, that loos’d from Spain  
Boldly advent’rous thro’ the polar main,  
A warlike race. should come, renown’d in arms,  
And shake the eastern world with war’s alarms,  
Whose glorious conquests and eternal fame  
In black Oblivion’s waves should whelm his name.

  Urania-Venus, <span id="fr_81"></span>[2](#fn_81) queen of sacred
love,  
Arose and fixed her asking eyes on Jove;  
Her eyes, well pleas’d, in Lusus’ sons could trace  
A kindred likeness to the Roman race,  
For whom of old such kind regard she bore; <span
id="fr_82"></span>[3](#fn_82)  
The same their triumphs on Barbaria’s shore,  
The same the ardour of their warlike flame,  
The manly music of their tongue the same: <span
id="fr_83"></span>[4](#fn_83)  
Affection thus the lovely goddess sway’d,  
Nor less what Fate’s unblotted page display’d,

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

Where’er this people should their empire raise,  
She knew her altars would unnumber’d blaze,  
And barb’rous nations at her holy shrine  
Be humaniz’d and taught her lore divine.  
Her spreading honours thus the one inspir’d,  
And one the dread to lose his worship fir’d.  
Their struggling factions shook th’ Olympian state  
With all the clam’rous tempest of debate.  
Thus, when the storm with sudden gust invades  
The ancient forest’s deep and lofty shades,  
The bursting whirlwinds tear their rapid course,  
The shatter’d oaks crash, and with echoes hoarse  
The mountains groan, while whirling on the blast  
The thick’ning leaves a gloomy darkness cast;  
Such was the tumult in the blest abodes,  
When Mars, high tow’ring o’er the rival gods,  
Stepp’d forth: stern sparkles from his eye-balls glanc’d,  
And now, before the throne of Jove advanc’d,  
O’er his left shoulder his broad shield he throws,  
And lifts his helm <span id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_84) above his
dreadful brows:  
Bold and enrag’d he stands, and, frowning round,  
Strikes his tall spear-staff on the sounding ground;  
Heav’n trembled, and the light turn’d pale <span
id="fr_85"></span>[2](#fn_85)--such dread  
His fierce demeanour o’er Olympus spread--  
When thus the warrior: "O Eternal Sire,  
Thine is the sceptre, thine the thunder’s fire,  
Supreme dominion thine; then, Father, hear,  
Shall that bold race which once to thee was dear,  
Who, now fulfilling thy decrees of old,  
Through these wild waves their fearless journey hold,  
Shall that bold race no more thy care engage,  
But sink the victims of unhallow’d rage!  
Did Bacchus yield to Reason’s voice divine,  
Bacchus the cause of Lusus’ sons would join,  
Lusus, the lov’d companion of his cares,  
His earthly toils, his dangers, and his wars:

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

But envy still a foe to worth will prove,  
To worth, though guarded by the arm of Jove.

  "Then thou, dread Lord of Fate, unmov’d remain,  
Nor let weak change thine awful counsels stain,  
For Lusus’ race thy promis’d favour show:  
Swift as the arrow from Apollo’s bow  
Let Maia’s <span id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_86) son explore the wat’ry
way,  
Where, spent with toil, with weary hopes, they stray;  
And safe to harbour, through the deep untried,  
Let him, empower’d, their wand’ring vessels guide;  
There let them hear of India’s wish’d-for shore,  
And balmy rest their fainting strength restore."

  He spoke: high Jove assenting bow’d the head,  
And floating clouds of nectar’d fragrance shed:  
Then, lowly bending to th’ Eternal Sire,  
Each in his duteous rank, the gods retire.

  Whilst thus in heaven’s bright palace fate was weigh’d  
Right onward still the brave Armada strayed:  
Right on they steer by Ethiopia’s strand  
And pastoral Madagascar’s <span id="fr_87"></span>[2](#fn_87) verdant
land.  
Before the balmy gales of cheerful spring,  
With heav’n their friend, they spread the canvas wing ,  
The sky cerulean, and the breathing air,  
The lasting promise of a calm declare.  
Behind them now the Cape of Praso <span
id="fr_88"></span>[3](#fn_88)bends,  
Another ocean to their view extends,  
Where black-topp’d islands, to their longing eyes,  
Lav’d by the gentle waves, <span id="fr_89"></span>[4](#fn_89) in
prospect rise.

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

But GAMA (captain of the vent’rous band,  
Of bold emprize, and born for high command,  
Whose martial fires, with prudence close allied,  
Ensur’d the smiles of fortune on his side)  
Bears off those shores which waste and wild appear’d,  
And eastward still for happier climates steer’d:  
When gath’ring round, and black’ning o’er the tide,  
A fleet of small canoes the pilot spied;  
Hoisting their sails of palm-tree leaves, inwove  
With curious art, a swarming crowd they move:  
Long were their boats, and sharp to bound along  
Through the dash’d waters, broad their oars and strong:  
The bending rowers on their features bore  
The swarthy marks of Phaeton’s <span id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90) fall
of yore:  
When flaming lightnings scorch’d the banks of Po,  
And nations blacken’d in the dread o’erthrow.  
Their garb, discover’d as approaching nigh,  
Was cotton strip’d with many a gaudy dye:  
’Twas one whole piece beneath one arm confin’d,  
The rest hung loose and flutter’d on the wind;  
All, but one breast, above the loins was bare,  
And swelling turbans bound their jetty hair:  
Their arms were bearded darts and faulchions broad,  
And warlike music sounded as they row’d.  
With joy the sailors saw the boats draw near,  
With joy beheld the human face appear:  
What nations these, their wond’ring thoughts explore,  
What rites they follow, and what God adore!  
And now with hands and ’kerchiefs wav’d in air  
The barb’rous race their friendly mind declare.  
Glad were the crew, and ween’d that happy day  
Should end their dangers and their toils repay.

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

The lofty masts the nimble youths ascend,  
The ropes they haul, and o’er the yard-arms bend;  
And now their bowsprits pointing to the shore,  
(A safe moon’d bay), with slacken’d sails they bore:  
With cheerful shouts they furl the gather’d sail  
That less and less flaps quiv’ring on the gale;  
The prows, their speed stopp’d, o’er the surges nod,  
The falling anchors dash the foaming flood;  
When, sudden as they stopp’d, the swarthy race,  
With smiles of friendly welcome on each face,  
The ship’s high sides swift by the cordage climb:  
Illustrious GAMA, with an air sublime,  
Soften’d by mild humanity, receives,  
And to their chief the hand of friendship gives,  
Bids spread the board, and, instant as he said,  
Along the deck the festive board is spread:  
The sparkling wine in crystal goblets glows,  
And round and round with cheerful welcome flows.  
While thus the vine its sprightly glee inspires,  
From whence the fleet, the swarthy chief enquires,  
What seas they past, what ’vantage would attain,  
And what the shore their purpose hop’d to gain?  
"From farthest west," the Lusian race reply,  
"To reach the golden Eastern shores we try.  
Through that unbounded sea whose billows roll  
From the cold northern to the southern pole;  
And by the wide extent, the dreary vast  
Of Afric’s bays, already have we past;  
And many a sky have seen, and many a shore,  
Where but sea monsters cut the waves before.  
To spread the glories of our monarch’s reign,  
For India’s shore we brave the trackless main,  
Our glorious toil, and at his nod would brave  
The dismal gulfs of Acheron’s <span id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_91) black
wave.  
And now, in turn, your race, your country tell,  
If on your lips fair truth delights to dwell  
To us, unconscious of the falsehood, show  
What of these seas and India’s site you know."

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

  "Rude are the natives here," the Moor replied;  
"Dark are their minds, and brute-desire their guide:  
But we, of alien blood, and strangers here,  
Nor hold their customs nor their laws revere.  
From Abram’s race our holy prophet sprung, <span
id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_92)  
An angel taught, and heaven inspir’d his tongue;  
His sacred rites and mandates we obey,  
And distant empires own his holy sway.  
From isle to isle our trading vessels roam,  
Mozambique’s harbour our commodious home.  
If then your sails for India’s shore expand,  
For sultry Ganges or Hydaspes’ <span id="fr_93"></span>[2](#fn_93)
strand,  
Here shall you find a pilot skill’d to guide  
Through all the dangers of the perilous tide,  
Though wide-spread shelves, and cruel rocks unseen,  
Lurk in the way, and whirlpools rage between.  
Accept, meanwhile, what fruits these islands hold,  
And to the regent let your wish be told.  
Then may your mates the needful stores provide,  
And all your various wants be here supplied."

  So spake the Moor, and bearing smiles untrue  
And signs of friendship, with his bands withdrew.  
O’erpower’d with joy unhop’d the sailors stood,  
To find such kindness on a shore so rude.

  Now shooting o’er the flood his fervid blaze,  
The red-brow’d sun withdraws his beamy rays;  
Safe in the bay the crew forget their cares,  
And peaceful rest their wearied strength repairs.  
Calm twilight now <span id="fr_94"></span>[3](#fn_94) his drowsy mantle
spreads,  
And shade on shade, the gloom still deep’ning, sheds.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

The moon, full orb’d, forsakes her wat’ry cave,  
And lifts her lovely head above the wave.  
The snowy splendours of her modest ray  
Stream o’er the glist’ning waves, and quiv’ring play:  
Around her, glitt’ring on the heaven’s arch’d brow,  
Unnumber’d stars, enclos’d in azure, glow,  
Thick as the dew-drops of the April dawn,  
Or May-flowers crowding o’er the daisy-lawn:  
The canvas whitens in the silvery beam,  
And with a mild pale red the pendants gleam:  
The masts’ tall shadows tremble o’er the deep;  
The peaceful winds a holy silence keep;  
The watchman’s carol, echo’d from the prows,  
Alone, at times, awakes the still repose.

  Aurora now, with dewy lustre bright,  
Appears, ascending on the rear of night.  
With gentle hand, as seeming oft to pause,  
The purple curtains of the morn she draws;  
The sun comes forth, and soon the joyful crew,  
Each aiding each, their joyful tasks pursue.  
Wide o’er the decks the spreading sails they throw;  
From each tall mast the waving streamers flow;  
All seems a festive holiday on board  
To welcome to the fleet the island’s lord.  
With equal joy the regent sails to meet,  
And brings fresh cates, his off’rings, to the fleet:  
For of his kindred race their line he deems,  
That savage race <span id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_95) who rush’d from
Caspia’s streams,

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

And triumph’d o’er the East, and, Asia won,  
In proud Byzantium <span id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_96) fix’d their
haughty throne.  
Brave VASCO hails the chief with honest smiles,  
And gift for gift with liberal hand he piles.  
His gifts, the boast of Europe’s heart disclose,  
And sparkling red the wine of Tagus flows.  
High on the shrouds the wond’ring sailors hung,  
To note the Moorish garb, and barb’rous tongue:  
Nor less the subtle Moor, with wonder fir’d,  
Their mien, their dress, and lordly ships admir’d:  
Much he enquires their king’s, their country’s name,  
And, if from Turkey’s fertile shores they came?  
What God they worshipp’d, what their sacred lore,  
What arms they wielded, and what armour wore?  
To whom brave GAMA: "Nor of Hagar’s blood  
Am I, nor plough from Ismael’s shores the flood;  
From Europe’s strand I trace the foamy way,  
To find the regions of the infant day.  
The God we worship stretch’d yon heaven’s high bow,  
And gave these swelling waves to roll below;  
The hemispheres of night and day He spread,  
He scoop’d each vale, and rear’d each mountain’s head;  
His Word produc’d the nations of the earth,  
And gave the spirits of the sky their birth;  
On earth, by Him, his holy lore was given,  
On earth He came to raise mankind to heaven.  
And now behold, what most your eyes desire,  
Our shining armour, and our arms of fire;  
For who has once in friendly peace beheld,  
Will dread to meet them on the battle field."

  Straight as he spoke <span id="fr_97"></span>[2](#fn_97) the warlike
stores display’d  
Their glorious show, where, tire on tire inlaid,

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

Appear’d of glitt’ring steel the carabines,  
There the plum’d helms, <span id="fr_98"></span>[1](#fn_98) and
pond’rous brigandines; <span id="fr_99"></span>[2](#fn_99)  
O’er the broad bucklers sculptur’d orbs emboss’d  
The crooked faulchions, dreadful blades were cross’d:  
Here clasping greaves, and plated mail-quilts strong;  
The long-bows here, and rattling quivers hung,  
And like a grove the burnish’d spears were seen,  
With darts and halberts double-edged between;  
Here dread grenadoes and tremendous bombs,  
With deaths ten thousand lurking in their wombs,  
And far around, of brown and dusky red,  
The pointed piles of iron balls were spread.  
The bombardiers, now to the regent’s view  
The thund’ring mortars and the cannon drew;  
Yet, at their leader’s nod, the sons of flame  
(For brave and gen’rous ever are the same)  
Withheld their hands, nor gave the seeds of fire  
To rouse the thunders of the dreadful tire.  
For GAMA’S soul disdain’d the pride of show  
Which acts the lion o’er the trembling roe.

  His joy and wonder oft the Moor express’d,  
But rankling hate lay brooding in his breast;  
With smiles ’obedient to his will’s control,  
He veils the purpose of his treach’rous soul:  
For pilots, conscious of the Indian strand,  
Brave VASCO sues, and bids the Moor command  
What bounteous gifts shall recompense their toils;  
The Moor prevents him with assenting smiles,  
Resolved that deeds of death, not words of air,  
Shall first the hatred of his soul declare;  
Such sudden rage his rankling mind possess’d,  
When GAMA’S lips Messiah’s name confess’d. <span
id="fr_100"></span>[3](#fn_100)

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

Oh depth of Heaven’s dread will, that ranc’rous hate  
On Heaven’s best lov’d in ev’ry clime should wait!  
Now, smiling round on all the wond’ring crew  
The Moor, attended by his bands, withdrew;  
His nimble barges soon approach’d the land,  
And shouts of joy receiv’d him on the strand.

  From heaven’s high dome the vintage-god <span
id="fr_101"></span>[1](#fn_101) beheld  
(Whom nine long months his father’s thigh conceal’d); <span
id="fr_102"></span>[2](#fn_102)  
Well pleas’d he mark’d the Moor’s determin’d hate  
And thus his mind revolv’d in self-debate:--

  "Has Heaven, indeed, such glorious lot ordain’d,  
By Lusus’ race such conquests to be gain’d  
O’er warlike nations, and on India’s shore,  
Where I, unrivall’d, claim’d the palm before?  
I, sprung from Jove! And shall these wand’ring few,  
What Ammon’s son <span id="fr_103"></span>[3](#fn_103) unconquer’d left,
subdue  
Ammon’s brave son who led the god of war  
His slave auxiliar at his thund’ring car?  
Must these possess what Jove to him denied,  
Possess what never sooth’d the Roman pride?  
Must these the victor’s lordly flag display  
With hateful blaze beneath the rising day,  
My name dishonour’d, and my victories stain’d,  
O’erturn’d my altars, and my shrines profan’d?  
No; be it mine to fan the Regent’s hate  
Occasion seiz’d commands the action’s fate.  
’Tis mine--this captain, now my dread no more,  
Shall never shake his spear on India’s shore."

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

  So spake the Power, <span id="fr_104"></span>[1](#fn_104) and with the
lightning’s flight  
For Afric darted thro’ the fields of light.  
His form divine he cloth’d in human shape, <span
id="fr_105"></span>[2](#fn_105)  
And rush’d impetuous o’er the rocky cape:  
In the dark semblance of a Moor he came  
For art and old experience known to fame:  
Him all his peers with humble deference heard,  
And all Mozambique and its prince rever’d:  
The prince in haste he sought, and thus express’d  
His guileful hate in friendly counsel dress’d:

  "And to the regent of this isle alone  
Are these adventurers and their fraud unknown?  
Has Fame conceal’d their rapine from his ear?  
Nor brought the groans of plunder’d nations here?  
Yet still their hands the peaceful olive bore  
Whene’er they anchor’d on a foreign shore:  
But nor their seeming nor their oaths I trust,  
For Afric knows them bloody and unjust.  
The nations sink beneath their lawless force,  
And fire and blood have mark’d their deadly course.  
We too, unless kind Heav’n and thou prevent,  
Must fall the victims of their dire intent,  
And, gasping in the pangs of death, behold  
Our wives led captive, and our daughters sold.  
By stealth they come, ere morrow dawn, to bring  
The healthful bev’rage from the living spring:  
Arm’d with his troops the captain will appear;  
For conscious fraud is ever prone to fear.  
To meet them there select a trusty band,  
And, in close ambush, take thy silent stand;  
There wait, and sudden on the heedless foe  
Rush, and destroy them ere they dread the blow.  
Or say, should some escape the secret snare,  
Saved by their fate, their valour, or their care,  
Yet their dread fall shall celebrate our isle,  
If Fate consent, and thou approve the guile.

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

Give then a pilot to their wand’ring fleet,  
Bold in his art, and tutor’d in deceit;  
Whose hand advent’rous shall their helms misguide,  
To hostile shores, or whelm them in the tide."

  So spoke the god, in semblance of a sage  
Renown’d for counsel and the craft of age.  
The prince with transport glowing in his face  
Approv’d, and caught him in a kind embrace:  
And instant at the word his bands prepare  
Their bearded darts and implements of war,  
That Lusus’ sons might purple with their gore  
The crystal fountain which they sought on shore:  
And, still regardful of his dire intent,  
A skilful pilot to the bay he sent,  
Of honest mien, yet practised in deceit,  
Who far at distance on the beach should wait,  
And to the ’scaped, if some should ’scape the snare  
Should offer friendship and the pilot’s care,  
But when at sea, on rocks should dash their pride,  
And whelm their lofty vanes beneath the tide.

  Apollo <span id="fr_106"></span>[1](#fn_106) now had left his wat’ry
bed,  
And o’er the mountains of Arabia spread  
His rays that glow’d with gold; when GAMA rose,  
And from his bands a trusty squadron chose:  
Three speedy barges brought their casks to fill  
From gurgling fountain, or the crystal rill:  
Full arm’d they came, for brave defence prepar’d,  
For martial care is ever on the guard:  
And secret warnings ever are imprest  
On wisdom such as wak’d in GAMA’s breast.

  And now, as swiftly springing o’er the tide  
Advanc’d the boats, a troop of Moors they spied;  
O’er the pale sands the sable warriors crowd,  
And toss their threat’ning darts, and shout aloud.

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

Yet seeming artless, though they dar’d the fight,  
Their eager hope they plac’d in artful flight,  
To lead brave GAMA where, unseen by day,  
In dark-brow’d shades their silent ambush lay.  
With scornful gestures o’er the beach they stride,  
And push their levell’d spears with barb’rous pride,  
Then fix the arrow to the bended bow,  
And strike their sounding shields, and dare the foe.  
With gen’rous rage the Lusian race beheld,  
And each brave breast with indignation swell’d,  
To view such foes, like snarling dogs, display  
Their threat’ning tusks, and brave the sanguine fray:  
Together with a bound they spring to land,  
Unknown whose step first trod the hostile strand.

  Thus, when to gain his beauteous charmer’s smile,  
The youthful lover dares the bloody toil, <span
id="fr_107"></span>[1](#fn_107)  
Before the nodding bull’s stern front he stands,  
He leaps, he wheels, he shouts, and waves his hands:  
The lordly brute disdains the stripling’s rage,  
His nostrils smoke, and, eager to engage,  
His hornèd brows he levels with the ground,  
And shuts his flaming eyes, and wheeling round  
With dreadful bellowing rushes on the foe,  
And lays the boastful gaudy champion low.  
Thus to the sight the sons of Lusus sprung,  
Nor slow to fall their ample vengeance hung:  
With sudden roar the carabines resound,  
And bursting echoes from the hills rebound;  
The lead flies hissing through the trembling air,  
And death’s fell dæmons through the flashes glare.  
Where, up the land, a grove of palms enclose,  
And cast their shadows where the fountain flows,  
The lurking ambush from their treach’rous stand  
Beheld the combat burning on the strand:

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

They see the flash with sudden lightnings flare,  
And the blue smoke slow rolling on the air:  
They see their warriors drop, and starting hear  
The ling’ring thunders bursting on their ear.  
Amaz’d, appall’d, the treach’rous ambush fled,  
And rag’d, <span id="fr_108"></span>[1](#fn_108) and curs’d their birth,
and quak’d with dread.  
The bands that vaunting show’d their threaten’d might,  
With slaughter gor’d, precipitate in flight;  
Yet oft, though trembling, on the foe they turn  
Their eyes that red with lust of vengeance burn:  
Aghast with fear, and stern with desperate rage  
The flying war with dreadful howls they wage,  
Flints, clods, and javelins hurling as they fly,  
As rage <span id="fr_109"></span>[2](#fn_109) and wild despair their
hands supply:  
And, soon dispers’d, their bands attempt no more  
To guard the fountain or defend the shore:  
O’er the wide lawns no more their troops appear:  
Nor sleeps the vengeance of the victor here;  
To teach the nations what tremendous fate  
From his right arm on perjur’d vows should wait,  
He seized the time to awe the Eastern world,  
And on the breach of faith his thunders hurl’d.  
*From his black ships the sudden lightnings blaze,  
And o’er old Ocean flash their dreadful rays:  
White clouds on clouds inroll’d the smoke ascends,  
The bursting tumult heaven’s wide concave rends:  
The bays and caverns of the winding shore  
Repeat the cannon’s and the mortar’s roar:* 

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

*The bombs, fair flaming, hiss along the sky,  
And, whirring through the air, the bullets fly;  
The wounded air, with hollow deafen’d sound,  
Groans to the direful strife, and trembles round*.

  *Now from the Moorish town the sheets of fire,  
Wide blaze succeeding blaze, to heaven aspire.  
Black rise the clouds of smoke, and by the gales  
Borne down, in streams hang hov’ring o’er the vales;  
And slowly floating round the mountain’s head  
Their pitchy mantle o’er the landscape spread.  
Unnumber’d sea fowl rising from the shore,  
Beat round in whirls at every cannon’s roar;  
Where o’er the smoke the masts’ tall heads appear,  
Hov’ring they scream, then dart with sudden fear;.  
On trembling wings far round and round they fly,  
And fill with dismal clang their native sky.  
Thus fled in rout confus’d the treach’rous Moors  
From field to field*, <span id="fr_110"></span>[1](#fn_110) then,
hast’ning to the shores,  
Some trust in boats their wealth and lives to save,  
And, wild with dread, they plunge into the wave;  
Some spread their arms to swim, and some beneath  
The whelming billows, struggling, pant for breath,  
Then whirl’d aloft their nostrils spout the brine;  
While show’ring still from many a carabine  
The leaden hail their sails and vessels tore,  
Till, struggling hard, they reach’d the neighb’ring shore:  
Due vengeance thus their perfidy repaid,  
And GAMA’S terrors to the East display’d.

  Imbrown’d with dust a beaten pathway shows  
Where ’midst umbrageous palms the fountain flows;  
From thence, at will, they bear the liquid health;  
And now, sole masters of the island’s wealth,  
With costly spoils and eastern robes adorn’d,  
The joyful victors to the fleet return’d.

  With hell’s keen fires still for revenge athirst  
The regent burns, and weens, by fraud accurst

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

To strike a surer yet a secret blow,  
And in one general death to whelm the foe.  
The promis’d pilot to the fleet he sends  
And deep repentance for his crime pretends.  
Sincere the herald seems, and while he speaks,  
The winning tears steal down his hoary cheeks.  
Brave GAMA, touch’d with gen’rous woe, believes,  
And from his hand the pilot’s hand receives:  
A dreadful gift! instructed to decoy,  
In gulfs to whelm them, or on rocks destroy.

  The valiant chief, impatient of delay,  
For India now resumes the wat’ry way;  
Bids weigh the anchor and unfurl the sail,  
Spread full the canvas to the rising gale.  
He spoke: and proudly o’er the foaming tide,  
Borne on the wind, the full-wing’d vessels ride;  
While as they rode before the bounding prows  
The lovely forms of sea-born nymphs arose.  
The while brave VASCO’S unsuspecting mind  
Yet fear’d not ought the crafty Moor design’d:  
Much of the coast he asks, and much demands  
Of Afric’s shores and India’s spicy lands.  
The crafty Moor by vengeful Bacchus taught  
Employ’d on deadly guile his baneful thought;  
In his dark mind he plann’d, on GAMA’S head  
Full to revenge Mozambique and the dead.  
Yet all the chief demanded he reveal’d,  
Nor aught of truth, that truth he knew, conceal’  
For thus he ween’d to gain his easy faith,  
And gain’d, betray to slavery or death.  
And now, securely trusting to destroy,  
As erst false Sinon <span id="fr_111"></span>[1](#fn_111) snar’d the
sons of Troy,  
"Behold, disclosing from the sky," he cries,  
"Far to the north, yon cloud-like isle arise:  
From ancient times the natives of the shore  
The blood-stain’d image on the cross adore."  
Swift at the word, the joyful GAMA cried:  
"For that fair island turn the helm aside;

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

O bring my vessels where the Christians dwell,  
And thy glad lips my gratitude shall tell."  
With sullen joy the treach’rous Moor complied,  
And for that island turn’d the helm aside.  
For well Quiloa’s <span id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_112) swarthy race he
knew,  
Their laws and faith to Hagar’s offspring true;  
Their strength in war, through all the nations round,  
Above Mozambique and her powers renown’d;  
He knew what hate the Christian name they bore,  
And hop’d that hate on VASCO’S bands to pour.

  Right to the land the faithless pilot steers,  
Right to the land the glad Armada bears;  
But heavenly Love’s fair queen, <span id="fr_113"></span>[2](#fn_113)
whose watchful care  
Had ever been their guide, beheld the snare.  
A sudden storm she rais’d: loud howl’d the blast,  
The yard-arms rattled, and each groaning mast  
Bended beneath the weight. Deep sunk the prows,  
And creaking ropes the creaking ropes oppose;  
In vain the pilot would the speed restrain,  
The captain shouts, the sailors toil in vain;

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

Aslope and gliding on the leeward side,  
The bounding vessels cut the roaring tide:  
Soon far they pass’d; and now the slacken’d sail  
Trembles and bellies to the gentle gale:  
Now many a league before the tempest toss’d  
The treach’rous pilot sees his purpose cross’d:  
Yet vengeful still, and still intent on guile,  
Behold, he cries, yon dim emerging isle:  
There live the votaries of Messiah’s lore  
In faithful peace, and friendship with the Moor.  
Yet all was false, for there Messiah’s name,  
Reviled and scorn’d, was only known by fame.  
The grovelling natives there, a brutal herd,  
The sensual lore of Hagar’s son <span id="fr_114"></span>[1](#fn_114)
preferr’d.  
With joy brave GAMA hears the artful tale,  
Bears to the harbour, and bids furl the sail.  
Yet, watchful still, fair Love’s celestial queen  
Prevents the danger with a hand unseen;  
Now past the bar his vent’rous vessel guides,  
And safe at anchor in the road he rides.

  Between the isle and Ethiopia’s land  
A narrow current laves each adverse strand;  
Close by the margin where the green tide flows,  
Full to the bay a lordly city rose;  
With fervid blaze the glowing evening pours  
Its purple splendours o’er the lofty towers;  
The lofty towers with milder lustre gleam,  
And gently tremble in the glassy stream.  
Here reign’d a hoary king of ancient fame;  
Mombas the town, Mombas the island’s name.

  As when the pilgrim, who with weary pace  
Thro’ lonely wastes untrod by human race,  
For many a day disconsolate has stray’d,  
The turf his bed, the wild-wood boughs his shade,  
O’erjoy’d beholds the cheerful seats of men  
In grateful prospect rising on his ken:  
So GAMA joy’d, who many a dreary day  
Had traced the vast, the lonesome, wat’ry way,

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

Had seen new stars, unknown to Europe, rise,  
And brav’d the horrors of the polar skies:  
So joy’d his bounding heart when, proudly rear’d,  
The splendid city o’er the wave appear’d,  
Where Heaven’s own lore, he trusted, was obey’d,  
And Holy Faith her sacred rites display’d.  
And now, swift crowding through the hornèd bay,  
The Moorish barges wing’d their foamy way,  
To GAMA’S fleet with friendly smiles they bore  
The choicest products of their cultur’d shore.  
But there fell rancour veil’d its serpent-head,  
Though festive roses o’er the gifts were spread.  
For Bacchus, veil’d in human shape, was here,

  And pour’d his counsel in the sov’reign’s ear.  
O piteous lot of man’s uncertain state!  
What woes on Life’s unhappy journey wait!  
When joyful Hope would grasp its fond desire,  
The long-sought transports in the grasp expire.  
By sea what treach’rous calms, what rushing storms,  
And death attendant in a thousand forms!  
By land what strife, what plots of secret guile,  
How many a wound from many a treach’rous smile!  
Oh where shall man escape his num’rous foes,  
And rest his weary head in safe repose!

<span id="fn_61"></span>[1:1](lusbk01.htm#fr_61) *The Lusiad;* in the
original, Os Lusiadas, The Lusiads, from the Latin name (*Lusitania*) of
Portugal, derived from Lusus or Lysas, the companion of Bacchus in his
travels, who settled a colony in Lusitania. See Plin. 1. iii. c. i.

was never spread before*.--M. Duperron de Castera, who has given a
French prose translation, or rather paraphrase, of the Lusiad, has a
long note on this passage, which, he tells us, must not be understood
literally. Our author, he says, could not be ignorant that the African
and Indian Oceans had been navigated before the times of the Portuguese.
The Phœnicians, whose fleets passed the straits of Gibraltar, made
frequent voyages in these seas, though they carefully concealed the
course of their navigation that <span id="page_2">p. 2</span> other
nations might not become partakers of their lucrative traffic.--See the
Periplus of Hanno, in Cory’s Ancient Fragments.--*Ed*.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[2:2](lusbk01.htm#fr_64) *To Holy Faith
unnumber’d altars rear’d*.--In no period of history does human nature
appear with more shocking, more diabolical features than in the wars of
Cortez, and the Spanish conquerors of South America. Zeal for the
Christian religion was esteemed, at the time of the Portuguese grandeur,
as the most cardinal virtue. and to propagate Christianity and extirpate
Mohammedanism were the most certain proofs of that zeal. In all their
expeditions this was professedly a principal motive of the Lusitanian
monarchs, and Camoëns understood the nature of epic poetry too well to
omit it.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[2:6](lusbk01.htm#fr_68) Vasco de Gama is, in a
great measure, though not exclusively, the hero of the Lusiad.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[3:1](lusbk01.htm#fr_69) King Sebastian, who
came to the throne in his minority. Though the warm imagination of
Camoëns anticipated the praises of the future hero, the young monarch,
like Virgil’s Pollio, had not the happiness to fulfil the prophecy. His
endowments and enterprising genius promised, indeed, a glorious reign.
Ambitious of military laurels, he led a powerful army into Africa, on
purpose to replace Muley Hamet on the throne of Morocco, from which he
had been deposed by Muley Molucco. On the 4th of August, 1578, in the
twenty-fifth year of his age, he gave battle to the usurper on the
plains of Alcazar. This was that memorable engagement, to which the
Moorish Emperor, extremely weakened by sickness, was carried in his
litter. By the impetuosity of the attack, the first line of the Moorish
infantry was broken, and the second disordered. Muley Molucco on this
mounted his horse, drew his sabre, and would have put himself at the
head of his troops, but was prevented by his attendants. His emotion of
mind was so great that he fell from his horse, and one of his guards
having caught him in his arms, conveyed him to his litter, where,
putting his finger on his lips to enjoin them silence, he immediately
expired. Hamet Taba stood by the curtains of the carriage, opened them
from time to time, and gave out orders as if he had received them from
the Emperor. Victory declared for the Moors, and the defeat of the
Portuguese was so total, that not above fifty of their whole army
escaped. Hieron de Mendoça and Sebastian de Mesa relate, that Don
Sebastian, after having two horses killed under him, was surrounded and
taken; but the party who had secured him, quarrelling among themselves
whose prisoner he was, a Moorish officer rode up and struck the king a
blow over the right eye, which brought him to the ground; when,
despairing of ransom, the others killed him. About twenty years after
this fatal defeat there appeared a stranger <span id="page_4">p.
4</span> at Venice, who called himself Sebastian, King of Portugal, whom
he so perfectly resembled, that the Portuguese of that city acknowledged
him for their sovereign. He underwent twenty-eight examinations before a
committee of the nobles, in which he gave a distinct account of the
manner in which he had passed his time from the fatal defeat at Alcazar.
It was objected, that the successor of Muley Molucco sent a corpse to
Portugal which had been owned as that of the king by the Portuguese
nobility who survived the battle. To this he replied, that his *valet de
chambre* had produced that body to facilitate his escape, and that the
nobility acted upon the same motive, and Mesa and Baena confess, that
some of the nobility, after their return to Portugal acknowledged that
the corpse was so disfigured with wounds that it was impossible to know
it. He showed natural marks on his body, which many remembered on the
person of the king whose name he assumed. He entered into a minute
detail of the transactions that had. passed between himself and the
republic, and mentioned the secrets of several conversations with the
Venetian ambassadors in the palace of Lisbon. He fell into the hands of
the Spaniards, who conducted him to Naples, where they treated him with
the most barbarous indignities. After they had often exposed him,
mounted on an ass, to the cruel insults of the brutal mob, he was
shipped on beard a galley, as a slave. He was then carried to St. Lucar,
from thence to a castle in the heart of Castile, and never was heard of
more. The firmness of his behaviour, his singular modesty and heroical
patience, are mentioned with admiration by Le Clede. To the last he
maintained the truth of his assertions; a word never slipped from his
lips which might countenance the charge of imposture, or justify the
cruelty of his persecutors.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[4:1](lusbk01.htm#fr_70) Portugal, when Camoëns
wrote his Lusiad, was at the zenith of its power and splendour. The
glorious successes which had attended the arms of the Portuguese in
Africa, had gained them the highest military reputation. Their fleets
covered the ocean. Their dominions and settlements extended along the
western and eastern sides of the vast African continent. From the Red
Sea to China and Japan, they were sole masters of the riches of the
East; and in America, the fertile and extensive regions of Brazil
completed their empire.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[4:2](lusbk01.htm#fr_71) Lusitania is the Latin
name of a Roman province which comprised the greater part of the modern
kingdom of Portugal, besides a considerable portion of Leon and Spanish
Estremadura.--*Ed*.

King of Portugal, the grandfather of Sebastian--

*Inque tuis Phœbus regnis oriensque cadensque  
   Vix longum fesso conderet axe diem.  
Et quæcunque vago se circumvolvit Olympo  
   Affulget ratibus flamma ministra tuis*.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[5:2](lusbk01.htm#fr_73) *i.e*. poetic. Aonia
was the ancient name of Bœotia, in which country was a fountain sacred
to the Muses, whence Juvenal sings of a poet--

"Enamoured of the woods, and fitted for drinking  
At the fountains of the Aonides."  
                                   Juv. Sat. vii. 58.--*Ed*.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[6:1](lusbk01.htm#fr_74) *To match the Twelve so

the old romances. For the episode of Magricio and his eleven companions,
see the sixth Lusiad.

III. King of Portugal, celebrated for a long and peaceful reign; and the
Emperor Charles V., who was engaged in almost continual wars.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[7:2](lusbk01.htm#fr_77) Some critics have
condemned Virgil for stopping his narrative to introduce even a short
observation of his own. Milton’s beautiful complaint of his blindness
has been blamed for the same reason, as being no part of the subject of
his poem. The address of Camoëns to Don Sebastian at the conclusion of
the tenth Lusiad has not escaped the same censure; though in some
measure undeservedly, as the poet has had the art to interweave therein
some part of the general argument of his poem.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[9:1](lusbk01.htm#fr_78) This brave Lusitanian,
who was first a shepherd and a famous hunter, and afterwards a captain
of banditti, exasperated at the tyranny of the Romans, encouraged his
countrymen to revolt and shake off the yoke. Being appointed general, he
defeated Vetilius the prætor, who commanded in Lusitania, or farther
Spain. After this he defeated, in three pitched battles, the prætors, C.
Plautius Hypsæus and Claudius Unimanus, though they led against him very
numerous armies. For six years he continued victorious, putting the
Romans to flight wherever he met them, and laying waste the countries of
their allies. Having obtained such advantages over the proconsul,
Servilianus, that the only choice which was left to the Roman army was
death or slavery, the brave Viriatus, instead of putting them all to the
sword, as he could easily have done, sent a deputation to the general,
offering to conclude a peace with him on this single condition, *That he
should continue master of the country now in his power, and that the
Romans should remain possessed of the rest of Spain*.

The proconsul, who expected nothing but death or slavery, thought these
very favourable and moderate terms, and without hesitation concluded a
peace, which was soon after ratified by the Roman senate and people.
Viriatus, by this treaty, completed the glorious design he had always in
view, which was to erect a kingdom in the vast country he had conquered
from the republic. And, had it not been for the treachery of the Romans,
he would have become, as Florus calls him, the Romulus of Spain.

The senate, desirous to revenge their late defeat, soon after this
peace, ordered Q. Servilius Cæpio to exasperate Viriatus, and force him,
by repeated affronts, to commit the first acts of hostility. But this
mean artifice did not succeed: Viriatus would not be provoked to a
breach of the peace. On this the Conscript Fathers, to the eternal
disgrace of their republic, ordered Cæpio to declare war, and to
proclaim Viriatus, who had given no provocation, an enemy to <span
id="page_10">p. 10</span> Rome. To this baseness Cæpio added one still
greater; he corrupted the ambassadors whom Viriatus had sent to
negotiate with him, who, at the instigation of the Roman, treacherously
murdered their protector and general while he slept.--UNIV. HISTORY.

ancient city in India sacred to Bacchus.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[11:2](lusbk01.htm#fr_81) *Urania-Venus*.--An
Italian poet has given the following description of the celestial
Venus--

*Questa è vaga di Dio Venere bella  
Vicina al Sole, e sopra ogni altra estella  
Questa è quella beata, a cui s’inchina,  
A cui si volge desiando amore,  
Chiamata cui del Ciel rara e divina

Second Book on the following passage--

*As when in Ida’s bower she stood of yore*, etc.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[11:4](lusbk01.htm#fr_83) *The manly music of
their tongue the same*.--Camoëns says:

*E na lingoa, na qual quando imagina,  
Com pouca corrupçao cré que he Latina*.

Qualifications are never elegant in poetry. Fanshaw’s translation and
the original both prove this:

   -------------------   *their tongue  
Which she thinks Latin, with small dross among*.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[12:1](lusbk01.htm#fr_84) *i.e*. helmet.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[12:2](lusbk01.htm#fr_85) ------------- *and the
light turn’d pale*.--The thought in the original has something in it
wildly great, though it is not expressed in the happiest manner of
Camoëns--

*O ceo tremeo, e Apollo detorvado  
Hum pauco a luz perdeo, como infiado*.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[13:4](lusbk01.htm#fr_89) *Lav’d by the gentle

encircled and laved. Thus rendered by Fanshaw--

*Neptune disclos’d new isles which he did play  
About, and with his billows danc’t the hay*.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[14:1](lusbk01.htm#fr_90) The historical
foundation of the fable of Phaeton is this. Phaeton was a young
enterprising prince of Libya. Crossing the Mediterranean in quest of
adventures, he landed at Epirus, from whence he went to Italy to see his
intimate friend Cygnus. Phaeton was skilled in astrology, from whence he
arrogated to himself the title of the son of Apollo. One day in the heat
of summer, as he was riding along the banks of the Po, his horses took
fright at a clap of thunder, and plunged into the river, where, together
with their master, they perished. Cygnus, who was a poet, celebrated the
death of his friend in verse, from whence the fable.--Vid. Plutarch, in
Vit. Pyrr.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[16:3](lusbk01.htm#fr_94) *Calm twilight

Virgil: by diversifying the scene he has made the description his own.
The passage alluded to is in the eighth Iliad--

Ως δ᾽ ὅτ᾽ ἐν οὐρανω ἄστρα φαεινὴν ἀμφὶ σελἡνην  
Φαἰνετ᾽ αριπρεπέα, etc.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span> Thus elegantly translated by Pope:--

*As when the moon, refulgent lamp of night,  
O’er heaven’s clear azure spreads her sacred light,  
When not a breath disturbs the deep serene,  
And not a cloud o’ercasts the solemn scene;  
Around her throne the vivid planets roll,  
And stars unnumber’d gild the glowing pole,  
O’er the dark trees a yellower verdure shed,  
And tip with silver every mountain’s head;  
Then shine the vales, the rocks in prospect rise,  
A flood of glory bursts from all the skies:  
The conscious swains, rejoicing in the sight,  
Eye the blue vault, and bless the useful light*.

Gama gives of his religion, consists, in the original, of thirty-two
lines, which M. Castera has reduced into the following sentence: *Leur
Governeur fait differentes questions au Capitaine, qui pour le
satisfaire lui explique en peu des mots la Religion que les Portugais
suivent, l’usage des armes dont ils se servent dans la guerre, et le
dessein qui les amène*.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[19:1](lusbk01.htm#fr_98) *i.e*., helmets.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[19:2](lusbk01.htm#fr_99) Coats of mail.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[19:3](lusbk01.htm#fr_100) *When Gama’s lips
Messiah’s name confess’d*.--This, and the reason of the Moor’s hate, is
entirely omitted by Castera. The original is, the Moor conceived hatred,
"knowing they were followers of the truth which the Son of David
taught." Thus rendered by Fanshaw

*Knowing they follow that unerring light,  
The Son of David holds out in’ his Book*.

Zacocia (governor of Mozambique) made no doubt but our people <span
id="page_20">p. 20</span> were of some Mohammedan country. The mutual
exchange of good offices between our people and these islanders promised
a long continuance of friendship, but it proved otherwise. No sooner did
Zacocia understand they were Christians, than all his kindness was
turned into the most bitter hatred; he began to meditate their ruin, and
sought to destroy the fleet.--OSORIO, Bp. of Sylves, Hist. of the
Portug. Discov.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[20:1](lusbk01.htm#fr_101) Bacchus, god of

infancy in a cave of mount Meros, which in Greek signifies a thigh.
Hence the fable.

*Thus, when to gain his beauteous charmer’s smile,  
The youthful lover dares the bloody toil*.

This simile is taken from a favourite exercise in Spain, where it is
usual to see young gentlemen of the best families entering the lists to
fight with a bull, adorned with ribbons, and armed with a javelin or
kind of cutlass, which the Spaniards call Machete.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[24:1](lusbk01.htm#fr_108)

    *Jamque faces et saxa volant, furor arma ministrat*.  
                                                  VIRG. Æn. i.

The Spanish commentator on this place relates a very extraordinary
instance of the *furor arma ministrans*. A Portuguese soldier at the
siege of Diu in the Indies, being surrounded by the enemy, and having no
ball to charge his musket, pulled out one of his teeth, and. with it
supplied the place of a bullet.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[27:2](lusbk01.htm#fr_113) *But heavenly Love’s
fair queen*.--When GAMA arrived in the East, the Moors were the only
people who engrossed the trade of those parts. Jealous of such
formidable rivals as the Portuguese, they employed every artifice to
accomplish the destruction of GAMA’S fleet. As the Moors were acquainted
with these seas and spoke the Arabic language, GAMA was obliged to
employ them both as pilots and interpreters. The circumstance now
mentioned by Camoëns is an historical fact. "The Moorish pilot," says De
Barros, "intended to conduct the Portuguese into Quiloa, telling them
that place was inhabited by Christians; but a sudden storm arising,
drove the fleet from that shore, where death or slavery would have been
the certain fate of GAMA and his companions. The villainy of the pilot
was afterwards discovered. As GAMA was endeavouring to enter the port of
Mombaz his ship struck on a sand-bank, and finding their purpose of
bringing him into the harbour defeated, two of the Moorish pilots leaped
into the sea and swam ashore. Alarmed at this tacit acknowledgment of
guilt, GAMA ordered two other Moorish pilots who remained on board to be
examined by whipping, who, after some time, made a full confession of
their intended villainy. This discovery greatly encouraged GAMA and his
men, who now interpreted the sudden storm which had driven them from
Quiloa as a miraculous interposition of Divine Providence in their
favour.
