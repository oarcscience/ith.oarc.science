<P>
Columbus was a failure.
</P>
<P>
He utterly failed to accomplish what NASA would call his 'mission profile,'
that is, to find a practical trade route to India.
Of course, he did get the biggest consolation prize in history...
</P>
<P>
Vasco da Gama, who sailed from Portugal in 1498,
however, succeeded in achieving Columbus' goal.
He rounded the Cape of Good Hope and reached India.
This accomplishment was memorialized shortly thereafter by this
epic poem written by a Portuguese sailor, Luis de Cam&otilde;ens.
Unless you were raised speaking Portuguese, it is unlikely you've
heard of Cam&otilde;ens.
However, if you were, you probably already know that he's
considered the Portuguese Shakespeare, and the <CITE>Lusiads</CITE>
the Portuguese national epic.
</P>
<P>
Although there have been several attempts to translate the <CITE>Lusiads</CITE> into
English, none have been very successful until the 20th century.
Notably, Richard Burton attempted a translation, but it has been
universally criticized.
Mickle's translation is provided here, not because it is of exceptional
literary quality, but because it is in the public domain, and
better than some of the rest.
If you would like to read this poem casually, I recommend a modern
<!-- @+CDEXCL -->
translation such as Landeg White's (see box on right), or
<!-- @-CDEXCL -->
<!-- @+CDINCL -->
<!-- translation such as Landeg White's (ISBN 0192801511), or -->

<P>
Mickle employs ABAB couplets, where the original
whereas Cam&otilde;ens used <CITE>ottava rima</CITE>, an ABABABCC form.
He also took a few liberties with the text.
In the most egregious case, he inserts a 300 line naval engagement
which is not found in the original; he also omits an entire section
where de Gama engages in questionable conduct.
However, the editor of this, the 1877 edition, indicates these sections.
Mickle's footnotes are worth consulting for the wealth of information
on the classical references, as well as Portuguese history.
However, some of his annotations must be taken with a grain of salt,
particularly his five page footnote in book X where he
deprecates Chinese culture, for no particular reason.
</P>
<P>
That said, Mickle is not entirely unreadable, and a thorough reading
of this edition along with the apparatus is well worth the trouble.
This is the first time a full English translation
of the <CITE>Lusiads</CITE> has appeared on the Internet, to my knowledge--JBH.
