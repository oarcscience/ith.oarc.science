<P>
This fantasy novel by William Morris is one of the first to have
a central female character.
The heroine, Birdalone, abducted and raised by a witch in the wood
of Evilshaw, escapes her captivity with the assistance of a good witch.
Habundia.
Birdalone encounters three maidens held prisoner by another witch,
and the quest to unite the maidens with their knightly lovers
rounds out the tale.
