### AUGUST.

ACROSS the gap made by our English hinds,  
Amidst the Roman's handiwork, behold  
Far off the long-roofed church; the shepherd binds  
The withy round the hurdles of his fold;  
Down in the foss the river fed of old,  
That through long lapse of time has grown to be  
The little grassy valley that you see.

   Rest here awhile, not yet the eve is still,  
The bees are wandering yet, and you may hear  
The barley mowers on the trenched hill,  
The sheep-bells, and the restless changing weir,  
All little sounds made musical and clear  
Beneath the sky that burning August gives,  
While yet the thought of glorious Summer lives.

   Ah, love! such happy days, such days as these,  
Must we still waste them, craving for the best,  
Like lovers o’er the painted images  
Of those who once their yearning hearts have blessed?  
Have we been happy on our day of rest?  
Thine eyes say "yes,"—but if it came again,  
Perchance its ending would not seem so vain.

NOW came fulfillment of the year's desire,  
The tall wheat, coloured by the August fire  
Grew heavy-headed, dreading its decay,  
And blacker grew the elm-trees day by day.  
About the edges of the yellow corn,  
And o’er the gardens grown somewhat outworn  
The bees went hurrying to fill up their store;  
The apple-boughs bent over more and more;  
With peach and apricot the garden wall,  
Was odorous, and the pears began to fall  
From off the high tree with each freshening breeze.  
   So in a house bordered about with trees,  
A little raised above the waving gold  
The Wanderers heard this marvellous story told,  
While ’twixt the gleaming flasks of ancient wine,  
They watched the reapers’ slow advancing line.
