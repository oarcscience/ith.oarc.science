<p><i>OF Heaven or Hell I have no power to sing,<br> I cannot ease the burden of your fears,<br> Or make quick-coming death a little thing,<br> Or bring again the pleasure of past years,<br> Nor for my words shall ye forget your tears,<br> Or hope again for aught that I can say,<br> The idle singer of an empty day</i>.</p>  
<p><i>But rather, when aweary of your mirth,<br> From full hearts still unsatisfied ye sigh,<br> And, feeling kindly unto all the earth,<br> Grudge every minute as it passes by,<br> Made the more mindful that the sweet days die&#151;<br> Remember me a little then I pray,<br> The idle singer of an empty day</i>.</p>  
<p><i>The heavy trouble, the bewildering care<br> That weighs us down who live and earn our bread,<br> These idle verses have no power to bear;</i> <A NAME="page_2"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 2</FONT></A><br> <i>So let me sing of names remembered,<br> Because they, living not, can ne&#146;er be dead,<br> Or long time take their memory quite away<br> From us poor singers of an empty day</i>.</p>  
<p><i>Dreamer of dreams, born out of my due time,<br> Why should I strive to set the crooked straight?<br> Let it suffice me that my murmuring rhyme<br> Beats with light wing against the ivory gate,<br> Telling a tale not too importunate<br> To those who in the sleepy region stay,<br> Lulled by the singer of an empty day</i>.</p>  
<p><i>Folk say, a wizard to a northern king<br> At Christmas-tide such wondrous things did show,<br> That through one window men beheld the spring,<br> And through another saw the summer glow,<br> And through a third the fruited vines a-row,<br> While still, unheard, but in its wonted way,<br> Piped the drear wind of that December day</i>.</p>  
<p><i>So with this Earthly Paradise it is,<br> If ye will read aright, and pardon me,<br> Who strive to build a shadowy isle of bliss<br> Midmost the beating of the steely sea,<br> Where tossed about all hearts of men must be;<br> Whose ravening monsters mighty men shall slay,<br> Not the poor singer of an empty day</i>.</p>
