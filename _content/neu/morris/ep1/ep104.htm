<p><i>THINK, listener, that I had the luck to stand,<br> Awhile ago within a flowery land,<br> Fair beyond words; that thence I brought away<br> Some blossoms that before my footsteps lay,<br> Not plucked by me, not over fresh or bright;<br> Yet, since they minded me of that delight,<br> Within the pages of this book I laid<br> Their tender petals, there in peace to fade.<br> Dry are they now, and void of all their scent<br> And lovely colour, yet what once was meant<br> By these dull stains, some men may yet descry<br> As dead upon the quivering leaves they lie.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold them here, and mock me if you will,<br> But yet believe no scorn of men can kill<br> My love of that fair land wherefrom they came,<br> Where midst the grass their petals once did flame</i>.</p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, since that land as ye should know,<br> Bears not alone the gems for summer's show,<br> Or gold and pearls for fresh green-coated spring,<br> Or rich adornment for the flickering wing<br> Of fleeting autumn, but path little fear<br> For the white conqueror of the fruitful year,<br> So in these pages month by month I show<br> Some portion of the flowers that erst did blow<br> In lovely meadows of the varying land,<br> Wherein erewhile I had the luck to stand</i>.</p>
