<p>O LOVE, this morn when the sweet nightingale<br> Had so long finished all he had to say,<br> That thou hadst slept, and sleep had told his tale;<br> And midst a peaceful dream had stolen away<br> In fragrant dawning of the first of May,<br> Didst thou see aught? didst thou hear voices sing<br> Ere to the risen sun the bells &#146;gan ring?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For then methought the Lord of Love went by<br> To take possession of his flowery throne,<br> Ringed round with maids, and youths, and minstrelsy;<br> A little while I sighed to find him gone,<br> A little while the dawning was alone,<br> And the light gathered; then I held my breath,<br> And shuddered at the sight of Eld and Death.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! Love passed me in the twilight dun,<br> His music hushed the wakening ousel's song;<br> But on these twain shone out the golden sun,<br> And o&#146;er their heads the brown bird's tune was strong,<br> As shivering, twixt the trees they stole along;<br> None noted aught their noiseless passing by,<br> The world had quite forgotten it must die.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_345"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 345</FONT></A></p>  
<p>NOW must these men be glad a little while<br> That they had lived to see May once more smile<br> Upon the earth; wherefore, as men who know<br> How fast the bad days and the good days go,<br> They gathered at the feast: the fair abode<br> Wherein they sat, o&#146;erlooked, across the road<br> Unhedged green meads, which willowy streams passed through,<br> And on that morn, before the fresh May dew<br> Had dried upon the sunniest spot of grass,<br> From bush to bush did youths and maidens pass<br> In raiment meet for May apparelled,<br> Gathering the milk-white blossoms and the red;<br> And now, with noon long past, and that bright day<br> Growing aweary, on the sunny way<br> They wandered, crowned with flowers, and loitering,<br> And weary, yet were fresh enough to sing<br> The carols of the morn, and pensive, still<br> Had cast away their doubt of death and ill,<br> And flushed with love, no more grew red with shame.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to the elders as they sat, there came,<br> With scent of flowers, the murmur of that folk<br> Wherethrough from time to time a song outbroke,<br> Till scarce they thought about the story due; <A NAME="page_346"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 346</FONT></A><br> Yet, when anigh to sunsetting it grew,<br> A book upon the board an elder laid,<br> And turning from the open window said,<br> "Too fair a tale the lovely time doth ask,<br> For this of mine to be an easy task,<br> Yet in what words soever this is writ,<br> As for the matter, I dare say of it<br> That it is lovely as the lovely May;<br> Pass then the manner, since the learned say<br> No written record was there of the tale,<br> Ere we from our fair land of Greece set sail;<br> How this may be I know not, this I know<br> That such-like tales the wind would seem to blow<br> From place to place, e&#146;en as the feathery seed<br> Is borne across the sea to help the need<br> Of barren isles; so, sirs, from seed thus sown,<br> This flower, a gift from other lands has grown.</p>
