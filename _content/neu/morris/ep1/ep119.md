#### THE

### WATCHING OF THE FALCON.

#### ARGUMENT.

THE case of this Falcon was such, that whoso watched it without sleeping
for seven days and seven nights, had his first wish granted him by a fay
lady, that appeared to him thereon; and some wished one thing, and some
another. But a certain King, who watched the Falcon daily, would wish
for nought but the love of that fay; which wish being accomplished, was
afterwards his ruin.

ACROSS the sea a land there is,  
Where, if fate will, may men have bliss,  
For it is fair as any land:  
There hath the reaper a full hand,  
While in the orchard hangs aloft  
The purple fig, a-growing soft;  
And fair the trellised vine-bunches  
Are swung across the high elm-trees;  
And in the rivers great fish play,  
While over them pass day by day  
The laden barges to their place.  
There maids are straight, and fair of face, <span id="page_553">p.
553</span>  
And men are stout for husbandry,  
And all is well as it can be  
Upon this earth where all has end.  
   For on them God is pleased to send  
The gift of Death down from above,  
That envy, hatred, and hot love,  
Knowledge with hunger by his side,  
And avarice and deadly pride,  
There may have end like everything  
Both to the shepherd and the king:  
Lest this green earth become but hell  
If folk thereon should ever dwell.  
   Full little most men think of this,  
But half in woe and half in bliss  
They pass their lives, and die at last  
Unwilling, though their lot be cast  
In wretched places of the earth,  
Where men have little joy from birth  
Until they die; in no such case  
Were those who tilled this pleasant place.  
   There soothly men were loth to die,  
Though sometimes in his misery  
A man would say "Would I were dead!"  
Alas! full little likelyhead  
That he should live for ever there.  
   So folk within that country fair  
Lived on unable to forget  
The longed-for things they could not get,  
And without need tormenting still <span id="page_554">p. 554</span>  
Each other with some bitter ill;  
Yea, and themselves too, growing grey  
With dread of some long-lingering day,  
That never came ere they were dead  
With green sods growing on the head;  
Nowise content with what they had,  
But falling still from good to bad  
While hard they sought the hopeless best;  
And seldom happy or at rest  
Until at last with lessening blood  
One foot within the grave they stood.

   Now so it chanced that in this land  
There did a certain castle stand,  
Set all alone deep in the hills,  
Amid the sound of falling rills  
Within a valley of sweet grass,  
To which there went one narrow pass  
Through the dark hills, but seldom trod.  
Rarely did horse-hoof press the sod  
About the quiet weedy moat,  
When unscared did the great fish float;  
Because men dreaded there to see  
The uncouth things of faërie;  
Nathless by some few fathers old  
These tales about the place were told  
   That neither squire nor seneschal  
Or varlet came in bower or hall,  
Yet all things were in order due, <span id="page_555">p. 555</span>  
Hangings of gold and red and blue,  
And tables with fair service set;  
Cups that had paid the Cæsar's debt  
Could he have laid his hands on them;  
Dorsars, with pearls in every hem,  
And fair embroidered gold-wrought things,  
Fit for a company of kings;  
And in the chambers dainty beds,  
With pillows dight for fair young heads;  
And horses in the stables were,  
And in the cellars wine full clear  
And strong, and casks of ale and mead;  
Yea, all things a great lord could need.  
   For whom these things were ready there  
None knew; but if one chanced to fare  
Into that place at Easter-tide,  
There would he find a falcon tied  
Unto a pillar of the Hall;  
And such a fate to him would fall,  
That if unto the seventh night,  
He watched the bird from dark to light,  
And light to dark unceasingly,  
On the last evening he should see  
A lady beautiful past words;  
Then, were he come of clowns or lords,  
Son of a swineherd or a king,  
There must she grant him anything  
Perforce, that he might dare to ask,  
And do his very hardest task. <span id="page_556">p. 556</span>  
   But if he slumbered, ne’er again  
The wretch would wake for he was slain  
Helpless, by hands he could not see,  
And his corpse mangled wretchedly.

   Now said these elders—Ere this tide  
Full many folk this thing have tried,  
But few have got much good thereby;  
For first, a many came to die  
By slumbering ere their watch was done;  
Or else they saw that lovely one,  
And mazed, they knew not what to say;  
Or asked for some small thing that day  
That easily they might have won,  
Nor staked their lives and souls thereon;  
Or asking, asked for some great thing  
That was their bane; as to be king  
One asked, and died the morrow morn  
That he was crowned, of all forlorn.  
   Yet thither came a certain man,  
Who from being poor great riches wan  
Past telling, whose grandsons now are  
Great lords thereby in peace and war.  
And in their coat-of-arms they bear,  
Upon a field of azure fair,  
A castle and a falcon, set  
Below a chief of golden fret.  
   And in our day a certain knight  
Prayed to be worsted in no fight, <span id="page_557">p. 557</span>  
And so it happed to him: yet he  
Died none the less most wretchedly,  
And all his prowess was in vain,  
For by a losel was he slain,  
As on the highway side he slept  
One summer night, of no man kept.

   Such tales as these the fathers old  
About that lonely castle told;  
And in their day the king must try  
Himself to prove that mystery,  
Although, unless the fay could give  
For ever on the earth to live,  
Nought could he ask that he had not:  
For boundless riches had he got,  
Fair children, and a faithful wife;  
And happily had passed his life,  
And all fulfilled of victory,  
Yet was he fain this thing to see.  
   So towards the mountains he set out  
One noontide, with a gallant rout  
Of knights and lords, and as the day  
Began to fail came to the way  
Where he must enter all alone,  
Between the dreary walls of stone.  
Thereon to that fair company  
He bade farewell, who wistfully  
Looked backward oft as home they rode.  
But in the entry he abode <span id="page_558">p. 558</span>  
Of that rough unknown narrowing pass,  
Where twilight at the high noon was.  
   Then onward he began to ride:  
Smooth rose the rocks on every side,  
And seemed as they were cut by man;  
Adown them ever water ran,  
But they of living things were bare,  
Yea, not a blade of grass grew there;  
And underfoot rough was the way,  
For scattered all about there lay  
Great jagged pieces of black stone.  
Throughout the pass the wind did moan,  
With such wild noises, that the King  
Could almost think he heard something  
Spoken of men; as one might hear  
The voices of folk standing near  
One's chamber wall: yet saw he nought  
Except those high walls strangely wrought,  
And overhead the strip of sky.  
   So, going onward painfully,  
He met therein no evil thing,  
But came about the sunsetting  
Unto the opening of the pass,  
And thence beheld a vale of grass  
Bright with the yellow daffodil;  
And all the vale the sun did fill  
With his last glory. Midmost there  
Rose up a stronghold, built four-square,  
Upon a flowery grassy mound, <span id="page_559">p. 559</span>  
That moat and high wall ran around.  
   Thereby he saw a walled pleasance,  
With walks and sward fit for the dance  
Of Arthur's court in its best time,  
That seemed to feel some magic clime;  
For though through all the vale outside  
Things were as in the April-tide,  
And daffodils and cowslips grew  
And hidden the March violets blew,  
Within the bounds of that sweet close  
Was trellised the bewildering rose;  
There was the lily over-sweet,  
And starry pinks for garlands meet;  
And apricots hung on the wall  
And midst the flowers did peaches fall,  
And nought had blemish there or spot,  
For in that place decay was not.

   Silent awhile the King abode  
Beholding all, then on he rode  
And to the castle-gate drew nigh,  
Till fell the drawbridge silently,  
And when across it he did ride  
He found the great gates open wide,  
And entered there, but as he passed  
The gates were shut behind him fast,  
But not before that he could see  
The drawbridge rise up silently.  
   Then round he gazed oppressed with awe, <span id="page_560">p.
560</span>  
And there no living thing he saw  
Except the sparrows in the eaves,  
As restless as light autumn leaves  
Blown by the fitful rainy wind.  
Thereon his final goal to find,  
He lighted off his war-horse good  
And let him wander as he would,  
When he had eased him of his gear;  
Then gathering heart against his fear.  
Just at the silent end of day  
Through the fair porch he took his way,  
And found at last a goodly hall  
With glorious hangings on the wall,  
Inwrought with trees of every clime,  
And stories of the ancient time,  
But all of sorcery they were.  
For o’er the dais Venus fair,  
Fluttered about by many a dove,  
Made hopeless men for hopeless love,  
Both sick and sorry; there they stood  
Wrought wonderfully in various mood,  
But wasted all by that hid fire  
Of measureless o’er-sweet desire,  
And let the hurrying world go by  
Forgetting all felicity.  
But down the hall the tale was wrought  
How Argo in old time was brought  
To Colchis for the fleece of gold.  
And on the other side was told <span id="page_561">p. 561</span>  
How mariners for long years came  
To Circe, winning grief and shame.  
Until at last by hardihead  
And craft, Ulysses won her bed.  
   Long upon these the King did look  
And of them all good heed he took;  
To see if they would tell him aught  
About the matter that he sought,  
But all were of the times long past;  
So going all about, at last  
When grown nigh weary of his search  
A falcon on a silver perch,  
Anigh the daïs did he see,  
And wondered, because certainly  
At his first coming ’twas not there;  
But ’neath the bird a scroll most fair,  
With golden letters on the white  
He saw, and in the dim twilight  
By diligence could he read this:—

   "*Ye who have not enow of bliss,  
And in this hard world labour sore,  
By manhood here may get you more,  
And be fulfilled of everything,  
Till ye be masters of the King.  
   And yet, since I who promise this  
Am nowise God lo give man bliss  
Past ending, now in time beware,  
And if you live in little care* <span id="page_562">p. 562</span>  
*At this time get you back again,  
Lest unknown woe you chance to gain  
In wishing for a thing untried*."

   A little while did he abide,  
When he had read this, deep in thought,  
Wondering indeed if there were aught  
He had not got, that a wise man  
Would wish; yet in his mind it ran  
That he might win a boundless realm,  
Yea, come to wear upon his helm  
The crown of the whole conquered earth;  
That all who lived thereon, from birth  
To death should call him King and Lord,  
And great kings tremble at his word,  
Until in turn he came to die.  
Therewith a little did he sigh,  
But thought, "Of Alexander yet  
Men talk, nor would they e’er forget  
My name, if this should come to be,  
Whoever should come after me:  
But while I lay wrapped round with gold  
Should tales and histories manifold  
Be written of me, false and true;  
And as the time still onward drew  
Almost a god would folk count me,  
Saying, 'In our time none such be.'  
But therewith did he sigh again,  
And said, "Ah, vain, and worse than vain! <span id="page_563">p.
563</span>  
For though the world forget me nought,  
Yet by that time should I be brought  
Where all the world I should forget,  
And bitterly should I regret  
That I, from godlike great renown,  
To helpless death must fall adown:  
How could I bear to leave it all?"  
   Then straight upon his mind did fall  
Thoughts of old longings half forgot,  
Matters for which his heart was hot  
A while ago: whereof no more  
He cared for some, and some right sore  
Had vexed him, being fulfilled at last.  
And when the thought of these had passed  
Still something was there left behind,  
That by no torturing of his mind,  
Could he in any language name,  
Or into form of wishing frame.

   At last he thought, "What matters it,  
Before these seven days shall flit  
Some great thing surely shall I find,  
That gained will not leave grief behind,  
Nor turn to deadly injury.  
So now will I let these things be  
And think of some unknown delight."

   Now, therewithal, was come the night,  
And thus his watch was well begun; <span id="page_564">p. 564</span>  
And till the rising of the sun,  
Waking, he paced about the hall,  
And saw the hangings on the wall  
Fade into nought, and then grow white  
In patches by the pale moonlight,  
And then again fade utterly  
As still the moonbeams passed them by;  
Then in a while, with hope of day,  
Begin a little to grow grey,  
Until familiar things they grew,  
As up at last the great sun drew,  
And lit them with his yellow light  
At ending of another night.  
   Then right glad was he of the day,  
That passed with him in such like way;  
For neither man nor beast came near,  
Nor any voices did he hear.  
And when again it drew to night  
Silent it passed, till first twilight  
Of morning came, and then he heard  
The feeble twittering of some bird,  
That, in that utter silence drear,  
Smote harsh and startling on his ear.  
   Therewith came on that lonely day  
That passed him in no other way;  
And thus six days and nights went by  
And nothing strange had come anigh.  
   And on that day he well-nigh deemed  
That all that story had been dreamed. <span id="page_565">p.
565</span>  
Daylight and dark, and night and day,  
Passed ever in their wonted way;  
The wind played in the trees outside,  
The rooks from out the high trees cried;  
And all seemed natural and fair,  
With little signs of magic there.  
Yet neither could he quite forget  
That close with summer blossoms set,  
And fruit hung on trees blossoming,  
When all about was early spring.  
Yea, if all this by man were made,  
Strange was it that still undecayed  
The food lay on the tables still  
Unchanged by man, that wine did fill  
The golden cups, still bright and red.  
And all was so apparelled  
For guests that came not, yet was all  
As though that servants filled the hall.  
   So waxed and waned his hopes, and still  
He formed no wish for good or ill.  
   And while he thought of this and that  
Upon his perch the falcon sat  
Unfed, unhooded, his bright eyes  
Beholders of the hard-earned prize,  
Glancing around him restlessly,  
As though he knew the time drew nigh  
When this long watching should be done.

   So little by little fell the sun, <span id="page_566">p. 566</span>  
From high noon unto sun-setting;  
And in that lapse of time the King,  
Though still he woke, yet none the less  
Was dreaming in his sleeplessness  
Of this and that which he had done  
Before this watch he had begun;  
Till, with a start, he looked at last  
About him, and all dreams were past;  
For now, though it was past twilight  
Without, within all grew as bright  
As when the noon-sun smote the wall,  
Though no lamp shone within the hall.  
   Then rose the King upon his feet,  
And well-nigh heard his own heart beat,  
And grew all pale for hope and fear,  
As sound of footsteps caught his ear  
But soft, and as some fair lady,  
Going as gently as might be,  
Stopped now and then awhile, distraught  
By pleasant wanderings of sweet thought.  
   Nigher the sound came, and more nigh,  
Until the King unwittingly  
Trembled, and felt his hair arise,  
But on the door still kept his eyes.  
That opened soon, and in the light  
There stepped alone a lady bright,  
And made straight toward him up the hall.  
   In golden garments was she clad  
And round her waist a belt she had <span id="page_567">p. 567</span>  
Of emeralds fair, and from her feet  
She held the raiment daintily,  
And on her golden head had she  
A rose-wreath round a pearl-wrought crown,  
Softly she walked with eyes cast down,  
Nor looked she any other than  
An earthly lady, though no man  
Has seen so fair a thing as she.,  
   So when her face the King could see  
Still more he trembled, and he thought  
"Surely my wish is hither brought,  
And this will be a goodly day  
If for mine own I win this may."  
And therewithal she drew anear  
Until the trembling King could hear  
Her very breathing, and she raised  
Her head and on the King's face gazed  
With serious eyes, and stopping there,  
Swept from her shoulders her long hair,  
And let her gown fall on her feet,  
Then spoke in a clear voice and sweet.

   "Well hast thou watched, so now O King,  
Be bold, and wish for some good thing;  
And yet, I counsel thee, be wise.  
Behold, spite of these lips and eyes,  
Hundreds of years old now am I  
And have seen joy and misery.  
And thou, who yet hast lived in bliss, <span id="page_568">p.
568</span>  
I bid thee well consider this;  
Better it were that men should live  
As beasts, and take what earth can give,  
The air, the warm sun and the grass  
Until unto the earth they pass,  
And gain perchance nought worse than rest,  
Than that not knowing what is best  
For sons of men, they needs must thirst  
For what shall make their lives accurst.  
   "Therefore I bid thee now beware,  
Lest getting something seeming fair,  
Thou com’st in vain to long for more;  
Or lest the thing thou wishest for  
Make thee unhappy till thou diest,  
Or lest with speedy death thou buyest  
A little hour of happiness  
Or lazy joy with sharp distress.  
   "Alas, why say I this to thee,  
For now I see full certainly,  
That thou wilt ask for such a thing,  
It had been best for thee to fling  
Thy body from a mountain top,  
Or in a white hot fire to drop,  
Or ever thou hadst seen me here,  
Nay then be speedy and speak clear."  
   Then the king cried out eagerly,  
Grown fearless, "Ah, be kind to me!  
Thou knowest what I long for then!  
Thou know’st that I, a king of men, <span id="page_569">p. 569</span>  
Will ask for nothing else than thee!  
Thou didst not say this could not be,  
And I have had enow of bliss,  
If I may end my life with this."  
   "Hearken," she said, "what men will say  
When they are mad; before to-day  
I knew that words such things could mean,  
And wondered that it could have been.  
   "Think well, because this wished-for joy,  
That surely will thy bliss destroy,  
Will let thee live, until thy life  
Is wrapped in such bewildering strife  
That all thy days will seem but ill—  
Now wilt thou wish for this thing still?"  
   "Wilt thou then grant it?" cried the King;  
"Surely thou art an earthly thing,  
And all this is but mockery,  
And thou canst tell no more than I  
What ending to my life shall be."  
   "Nay, then," she said, "I grant it thee  
Perforce; come nigh, for I am thine  
Until the morning sun doth shine,  
And only coming time can prove  
What thing I am."  
                      Dizzy with love,  
And with surprise struck motionless  
That this divine thing, with far less  
Of striving than a village maid,  
Had yielded, there he stood afraid, <span id="page_570">p. 570</span>  
Spite of hot words and passionate,  
And strove to think upon his fate.

   But as he stood there, presently  
With smiling face she drew anigh,  
And on his face he felt her breath.  
"O love," she said, "dost thou fear death?  
Not till next morning shalt thou die,  
Or fall into thy misery."  
Then on his hand her hand did fall,  
And forth she led him down the hall,  
Going full softly by his side.  
   "O love," she said, "now well betide  
The day whereon thou cam’st to me.  
I would this night a year might be,  
Yea, life-long; such life as we have,  
A thousand years from womb to grave."

   And then that clinging hand seemed worth  
Whatever joy was left on earth,  
And every trouble he forgot,  
And time and death remembered not:  
Kinder she grew, she clung to him  
With loving arms, her eyes did swim  
With love and pity, as he strove  
To show the wisdom of his love;  
With trembling lips she praised his choice,  
And said, "Ah, well may’st thou rejoice, <span id="page_571">p.
571</span>  
Well may’st thou think this one short night  
Worth years of other men's delight,  
If thy own heart as my heart is,  
Sunk in a boundless sea of bliss;  
O love, rejoice with me! rejoice!"  
   But as she spoke, her honied voice  
Trembled, and midst of sobs she said,  
"O love, and art thou still afraid?  
Return, then, to thine happiness,  
Nor will I love thee any less;  
But watch thee as a mother might  
Her child at play."  
                      With strange delight  
He stammered out, "Nay, keep thy tears  
For me, and for my ruined years  
Weep love, that I may love thee more,  
My little hour will soon be o’er."  
   "Ah, love," she said, "and thou art wise  
As men are, with long miseries  
Buying these idle words and vain,  
My foolish love, with lasting pain;  
And yet, thou wouldst have died at last  
If in all wisdom thou hadst passed  
Thy weary life: forgive me then,  
In pitying the sad life of men."  
   Then in such bliss his soul did swim,  
But tender music unto him  
Her words were; death and misery  
But empty names were grown to be, <span id="page_572">p. 572</span>  
As from that place his steps she drew,  
And dark the hall behind them grew.

 

 

BUT end comes to all earthly bliss,  
And by his choice full short was his;  
And in the morning, grey and cold,  
Beside the dais did she hold  
His trembling hand, and wistfully  
He, doubting what his fate should be,  
Gazed at her solemn eyes, that now,  
Beneath her calm, untroubled brow,  
Were fixed on his wild face and wan;  
At last she said, "Oh, hapless man,  
Depart! your full wish you have had;  
A little time you have been glad,  
You shall be sorry till you die.  
   "And though, indeed, full fain am I  
This might not be; nathless, as day  
Night follows, colourless and grey,  
So this shall follow your delight,  
Your joy hath ending with last night—  
Nay, peace, and hearken to your fate.  
   "Strife without peace, early and late,  
Lasting long after you are dead,  
And laid with earth upon your head;  
War without victory shall you have <span id="page_573">p. 573</span>  
Defeat, nor honour shall you save;  
Your fair land shall be rent and torn,  
Your people be of all forlorn,  
And all men curse you for this thing."  
   She loosed his hand, but yet the King  
Said, "Yea, and I may go with thee?  
Why should we part? then let things be  
E’en as they will!" "Poor man," she said,  
"Thou ravest; our hot love is dead,  
If ever it had any life:  
Go, make thee ready for the strife  
Wherein thy life shall soon be wrapped;  
And of the things that here have happed  
Make thou such joy as thou may’st do;  
But I from this place needs must go,  
Nor shalt thou ever see me more  
Until thy troubled life is o’er:  
Alas! to say 'farewell' to thee  
Were nought but bitter mockery.  
Fare as thou may’st, and with good heart  
Play to the end thy wretched part."

   Therewith she turned and went from him,  
And with such pain his eyes did swim  
He scarce could see her leave the place.  
And then, with troubled and pale face,  
He gat him thence: and soon he found  
His good horse in the base-court bound;  
So, loosing him, forth did he ride, <span id="page_574">p. 574</span>  
For the great gates were open wide,  
And flat the heavy draw-bridge lay.

   So by the middle of the day,  
That murky pass had he gone through,  
And come to country that he knew;  
And homeward turned his horse's head,  
And passing village and homestead  
Nigh to his palace came at last;  
And still the further that he passed  
From that strange castle of the fays,  
More dreamlike seemed those seven days,  
And dreamlike the delicious night;  
And like a dream the shoulders white,  
And clinging arms and yellow hair,  
And dreamlike the sad morning there.  
Until at last he ’gan to deem  
That all might well have been a dream—  
Yet why was life a weariness?  
What meant this sting of sharp distress?  
This longing for a hopeless love,  
No sighing from his heart could move?

   Or else, 'she did not come and go  
As fays might do, but soft and slow  
Her lovely feet fell on the floor;  
She set her fair hand to the door  
As any dainty maid might do;  
And though, indeed, there are but few <span id="page_575">p.
575</span>  
Beneath the sun as fair as she,  
She seemed a fleshly thing to be.  
Perchance a merry mock this is,  
And I may some day have the bliss  
To see her lovely face again,  
As smiling she makes all things plain.  
And then as I am still a king,  
With me may she make tarrying  
Full long, yea, till I come to die.'  
   Therewith at last being come anigh  
Unto his very palace gate,  
He saw his knights and squires wait  
His coming, therefore on the ground  
He lighted, and they flocked around  
Till he should tell them of his fare.  
Then mocking said he, "Ye may dare,  
The worst man of you all, to go  
And watch as I was bold to do;  
For nought I heard except the wind;  
And nought I saw to call to mind."  
So said he, but they noted well  
That something more he had to tell  
If it had pleased him; one old man,  
Beholding his changed face and wan,  
Muttered, "Would God it might be so!  
Alas! I fear what fate may do;  
Too much good fortune hast thou had  
By anything to be more glad  
Than thou hast been, I fear thee then <span id="page_576">p.
576</span>  
Lest thou becom’st a curse to men."  
But to his place the doomed King passed,  
And all remembrance strove to cast  
From out his mind of that past day,  
And spent his life in sport and play.

 

 

GREAT among other kings, I said  
He was before he first was led  
Unto that castle of the fays,  
But soon he lost his happy days  
And all his goodly life was done.  
   And first indeed his best-loved son,  
The very apple of his eye,  
Waged war against him bitterly;  
And when this son was overcome  
And taken, and folk led him home,  
And him the King had gone to meet,  
Meaning with gentle words and sweet  
To win him to his love again,  
By his own hand he found him slain.  
   I know not if the doomed King yet  
Remembered the fay lady's threat,  
But troubles upon troubles came:  
His daughter next was brought to shame,  
Who unto all eyes seemed to be  
The image of all purity, <span id="page_577">p. 577</span>  
And fleeing from the royal place  
The King no more beheld her face.  
Then next a folk that came from far  
Sent to the King great threats of war,  
But he, full-fed of victory,  
Deemed this a little thing to be,  
And thought the troubles of his home  
Thereby he well might overcome  
Amid the hurry of the fight.  
   His foemen seemed of little might,  
Although they thronged like summer bees  
About the outlying villages,  
And on the land great ruin brought.  
Well, he this barbarous people sought  
With such an army as seemed meet  
To put the world beneath his feet;  
The day of battle came, and he,  
Flushed with the hope of victory,  
Grew happy, as he had not been  
Since he those glorious eyes had seen.  
   They met,—his solid ranks of steel  
There scarcely more the darts could feel  
Of those new foemen, than if they  
Had been a hundred miles away:—  
They met,—a storied folk were his  
To whom sharp war had long been bliss,  
A thousand years of memories  
Were flashing in their shielded eyes;  
And grave philosophers they had <span id="page_578">p. 578</span>  
To bid them ever to be glad  
To meet their death and get life done  
Midst glorious deeds from sire to son.  
   And those they met were beasts, or worse,  
To whom life seemed a jest, a curse;  
Of fame and name they had not heard;  
Honour to them was but a word,  
A word spoke in another tongue;  
No memories round their banners clung,  
No walls they knew, no art of war,  
By hunger were they driven afar  
Unto the place whereon they stood,  
Hungry for bestial joys and blood.

   No wonder if these barbarous men  
Were slain by hundreds to each ten  
Of the King's brave well-armoured folk,  
No wonder if their charges broke  
To nothing, on the walls of steel,  
And back the baffled hordes must reel.  
So stood throughout a summer day  
Scarce touched the King's most fair array,  
Yet as it drew to even-tide  
The foe still surged on every side,  
As hopeless hunger-bitten men,  
About his folk grown wearied then.  
   Therewith the King beheld that crowd  
Howling and dusk, and cried aloud,  
"What do ye, soldiers? and how long <span id="page_579">p. 579</span>  
Shall weak folk hold in check the strong.  
Nay, forward banners! end the day  
And show these folk how brave men play."  
The young knights shouted at his word,  
But the old folk in terror heard  
The shouting run adown the line,  
And saw men flush as if with wine—  
"O Sire" they said "the day is sure,  
Nor will these folk the night endure  
Beset with misery and fears."  
Alas! they spoke to heedless ears;  
For scarce one look on them he cast  
But forward through the ranks he passed,  
And cried out, "Who will follow me  
To win a fruitful victory?"  
And toward the foe in haste he spurred,  
And at his back their shouts he heard,  
Such shouts as he ne’er heard again.

   They met—ere moonrise all the plain  
Was filled by men in hurrying flight  
The relics of that shameful fight;  
The close array, the full-armed men,  
The ancient fame availed not then,  
The dark night only was a friend  
To bring that slaughter to an end;  
And surely there the King had died,  
But driven by that back-rushing tide  
Against his will he needs must flee; <span id="page_580">p. 580</span>  
And as he pondered bitterly  
On all that wreck that he had wrought,  
From time to time indeed he thought  
Of the fay woman's dreadful threat.

   "But everything was not lost yet;"  
Next day he said, great was the rout  
And shameful beyond any doubt,  
But since indeed at eventide  
The rout began, not many died,  
And gathering all the stragglers now  
His troops still made a gallant show—  
Alas! it was a show indeed;  
Himself desponding, did he lead  
His beaten men against the foe,  
Thinking at least to lie alow  
Before the final rout should be;  
But scarce upon the enemy  
Could these, whose shaken banners shook  
The frightened world, now dare to look;  
Nor yet could the doomed King die there  
A death he once had held most fair;  
Amid unwounded men he came  
Back to his city, bent with shame,  
Unkingly, midst his great distress,  
Yea, weeping at the bitterness  
Of women's curses that did greet  
His passage down the troubled street.  
   But sight of all the things they loved, <span id="page_581">p.
581</span>  
The memory of their manhood moved  
Within the troops, and aged men  
And boys must think of battle then,  
And men that had not seen the foe  
Must clamour to the war to go.  
So a great army poured once more  
From out the city, and before  
The very gates they fought again,.  
But their late valour was in vain;  
They died indeed, and that was good,  
But nought they gained for all the blood  
Poured out like water; for the foe,  
Men might have stayed a while ago,  
A match for very gods were grown,  
So like the field in June-tide mown  
The king's men fell, and but in vain  
The remnant strove the town to gain;  
Whose battlements were nought to stay  
An untaught foe upon that day,  
Though many a tale the annals told  
Of sieges in the days of old,  
When all the world then knew of war  
From that fair place was driven afar.

   As for the King, a charmed life  
He seemed to bear; from out that strife  
He came unhurt, and he could see,  
As down the valley he did flee  
With his most wretched company, <span id="page_582">p. 582</span>  
His palace flaming to the sky.  
Then in the very midst of woe  
His yearning thoughts would backward go  
Unto the castle of the fay;  
He muttered, "Shall I curse that day,  
The last delight that I have had,  
For certainly I then was glad?  
And who knows if what men call bliss  
Had been much better now than this  
When I am hastening to the end."  
   That fearful rest, that dreaded friend,  
That Death, he did not gain as yet;  
A band of men he soon did get,  
A ruined rout of bad and good,  
With whom within the tangled wood,  
The rugged mountain, he abode,  
And thenceforth oftentimes they rode  
Into the fair land once called his,  
And yet but little came of this,  
Except some added misery  
Unto that miserable realm:  
The barbarous foe did overwhelm  
The cities and the fertile plain,  
And many a peaceful man was slain,  
And many a maiden brought to shame,  
And yielded towns were set aflame;  
For all the land was masterless.

   Long dwelt the King in great distress <span id="page_583">p.
583</span>  
From wood to mountain ever tost,  
Mourning for all that he had lost,  
Until it chanced upon a day,  
Asleep in early morn he lay,  
And in a vision there did see  
Clad all in black, that fay lady  
Whereby all this had come to pass,  
But dim as in a misty glass:  
She said "I come thy death to tell  
Yet now to thee may say 'farewell,'  
For in a short space wilt thou be  
Within an endless dim country  
Where thou mayest well win woe or bliss."  
Therewith she stooped his lips to kiss  
And vanished straightway from his sight,  
So waking there he sat upright  
And looked around, but nought could see  
And heard but song-birds’ melody,  
For it was the first hour of day.

   Then with a sigh adown he lay  
And slept, nor ever woke again,  
For that same hour was he slain  
By stealthy traitors as he slept.  
   He of a few was much bewept,  
But of most men was well forgot  
While that town's ashes still were hot  
The foeman on that day did burn. <span id="page_584">p. 584</span>  
   As for the land, great Time did turn  
The bloody fields to deep green grass,  
And from the minds of men did pass  
The memory of that time of woe,  
And at this day all things are so  
As first I said; a land it is  
Where men may dwell in rest and bliss  
If so they will—Who yet will not,  
Because their hasty hearts are hot  
With foolish hate, and longing vain  
The sire and dam of grief and pain.

 

<span id="page_585">p. 585</span>

NEATH the bright sky cool grew the weary earth,  
And many a bud in that fair hour had birth  
Upon the garden bushes; in the west  
The sky got ready for the great sun's rest,  
And all was fresh and lovely; none the less  
Although those old men shared the happiness  
Of the bright eve, ’twas mixed with memories  
Of how they might in old times have been wise,  
Not casting by for very wilfulness  
What wealth might come their changing life to bless;  
Lulling their hearts to sleep, amid the cold  
Of bitter times, that so they might behold  
Some joy at last, e’en if it lingered long.  
That, wearing not their souls with grief and wrong,  
They still might watch the changing world go by,  
Content to live, content at last to die.  
   Alas! if they had reached content at last,  
It was perforce when all their strength was past;  
And after loss of many days once bright,  
With foolish hopes of unattained delight.
