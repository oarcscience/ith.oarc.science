<p><A NAME="page_506"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 506</FONT></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE LADY OF THE LAND.</h3>  <h4 align="center">ARGUMENT.</h4>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">A CERTAIN Man having landed on an Island in the Greek Sea, found there a beautiful damsel, whom he would fain have delivered from a strange and dreadful doom, but failing herein, he died soon afterwards.</FONT></p>  
<p>IT happened once, some men of Italy<br> Midst the Greek islands went a sea-roving,<br> And much good fortune had they on the sea:<br> Of many a man they had the ransoming,<br> And many a chain they gat, and goodly thing;<br> And midst their voyage to an isle they came,<br> Whereof my story keepeth not the name.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now though but little was there left to gain,<br> Because the richer folk had gone away,<br> Yet since by this of water they were fain<br> They came to anchor in a land-locked bay,<br> Whence in a while some went ashore to play,<br> Going but lightly armed in twos or threes,<br> For midst that folk they feared no enemies. <A NAME="page_507"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 507</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of these fellows that thus went ashore,<br> One was there who left all his friends behind;<br> Who going inland ever more and more,<br> And being left quite alone, at last did find<br> A lonely valley sheltered from the wind,<br> Wherein, amidst an ancient cypress wood,<br> A long-deserted ruined castle stood.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wood, once ordered in fair grove and glade,<br> With gardens overlooked by terraces,<br> And marble-paved pools for pleasure made,<br> Was tangled now, and choked with fallen trees;<br> And he who went there, with but little ease<br> Must stumble by the stream's side, once made meet<br> For tender women's dainty wandering feet.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raven's croak, the low wind choked and drear,<br> The baffled stream, the grey wolf's doleful cry,<br> Were all the sounds that mariner could hear,<br> As through the wood he wandered painfully;<br> But as unto the house he drew anigh,<br> The pillars of a ruined shrine he saw,<br> The once fair temple of a fallen law.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No image was there left behind to tell<br> Before whose face the knees of men had bowed;<br> An altar of black stone, of old wrought well,<br> Alone beneath a ruined roof now showed<br> The goal whereto the folk were wont to crowd, <A NAME="page_508"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 508</FONT></A><br> Seeking for things forgotten long ago,<br> Praying for heads long ages laid a-low.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close to the temple was the castle-gate,<br> Doorless and crumbling; there our fellow turned,<br> Trembling indeed at what might chance to wait<br> The prey entrapped, yet with a heart that burned<br> To know the most of what might there be learned,<br> And hoping somewhat too, amid his fear,<br> To light on such things as all men hold dear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noble the house was, nor seemed built for war,<br> But rather like the work of other days,<br> When men, in better peace than now they are,<br> Had leisure on the world around to gaze,<br> And noted well the past times&#146; changing ways;<br> And fair with sculptured stories it was wrought,<br> By lapse of time unto dim ruin brought.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as he looked about on all these things,<br> And strove to read the mouldering histories,<br> Above the door an image with wide wings,<br> Whose unclad limbs a serpent seemed to seize,<br> He dimly saw, although the western breeze,<br> And years of biting frost and biting rain,<br> Had made the carver's labour well-nigh vain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this, though perished sore, and worn away,<br> He noted well, because it seemed to be, <A NAME="page_509"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 509</FONT></A><br> After the fashion of another day,<br> Some great man's badge of war, or armoury,<br> And round it a carved wreath he seemed to see:<br> But taking note of these things, at the last<br> The mariner beneath the gateway passed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there a lovely cloistered court he found,<br> A fountain in the midst o&#146;erthrown and dry,<br> And in the cloister briers twining round<br> The slender shafts; the wondrous imagery<br> Outworn by more than many years gone by,<br> Because the country people, in their fear<br> Of wizardry, had wrought destruction here;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And piteously these fair things had been maimed;<br> There stood great Jove, lacking his head of might;<br> Here was the archer, swift Apollo, lamed;<br> The shapely limbs of Venus hid from sight<br> By weeds and shards; Diana's ankles light<br> Bound with the cable of some coasting ship;<br> And rusty nails through Helen's maddening lip.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefrom unto the chambers did he pass,<br> And found them fair still, midst of their decay,<br> Though in them now no sign of man there was,<br> And everything but stone had passed away<br> That made them lovely in that vanished day;<br> Nay, the mere walls themselves would soon be gone<br> And nought be left but heaps of mouldering stone. <A NAME="page_510"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 510</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he, when all the place he had gone o&#146;er,<br> And with much trouble clomb the broken stair,<br> And from the topmost turret seen the shore<br> And his good ship drawn up at anchor there,<br> Came down again, and found a crypt most fair<br> Built wonderfully beneath the greatest hall,<br> And there he saw a door within the wall,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well-hinged, close shut; nor was there in that place<br> Another on its hinges, therefore he<br> Stood there and pondered for a little space,<br> And thought, "Perchance some marvel I shall see,<br> For surely here some dweller there must be,<br> Because this door seems whole, and new, and sound,<br> While nought but ruin I can see around."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with that word, moved by a strong desire,<br> He tried the hasp, that yielded to his hand,<br> And in a strange place, lit as by a fire<br> Unseen but near, he presently did stand;<br> And by an odorous breeze his face was fanned,<br> As though in some Arabian plain he stood,<br> Anigh the border of a spice-tree wood.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moved not for awhile, but looking round,<br> He wondered much to see the place so fair,<br> Because, unlike the castle above ground,<br> No pillager or wrecker had been there;<br> It seemed that time had passed on otherwhere, <A NAME="page_511"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 511</FONT></A><br> Nor laid a finger on this hidden place,<br> Rich with the wealth of some forgotten race.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hangings, fresh as when they left the loom,<br> The walls were hung a space above the head,<br> Slim ivory chairs were set about the room,<br> And in one corner was a dainty bed,<br> That seemed for some fair queen apparelled;<br> And marble was the worst stone of the floor,<br> That with rich Indian webs was covered o&#146;er.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wanderer trembled when he saw all this,<br> Because he deemed by magic it was wrought;<br> Yet in his heart a longing for some bliss,<br> Whereof the hard and changing world knows nought,<br> Arose and urged him on, and dimmed the thought<br> That there perchance some devil lurked to slay<br> The heedless wanderer from the light of day.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over against him was another door<br> Set in the wall, so, casting fear aside,<br> With hurried steps he crossed the varied floor,<br> And there again the silver latch he tried<br> And with no pain the door he opened wide,<br> And entering the new chamber cautiously<br> The glory of great heaps of gold could see.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the floor uncounted medals lay,<br> Like things of little value; here and there <A NAME="page_512"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 512</FONT></A><br> Stood golden caldrons, that might well outweigh<br> The biggest midst an emperor's copper ware,<br> And golden cups were set on tables fair,<br> Themselves of gold; and in all hollow things<br> Were stored great gems, worthy the crowns of kings.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls and roof with gold were overlaid,<br> And precious raiment from the wall hung down;<br> The fall of kings that treasure might have stayed,<br> Or gained some longing conqueror great renown,<br> Or built again some god-destroyed old town;<br> What wonder, if this plunderer of the sea<br> Stood gazing at it long and dizzily?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the last his troubled eyes and dazed<br> He lifted from the glory of that gold,<br> And then the image, that well-nigh erased<br> Over the castle-gate he did behold,<br> Above a door well wrought in coloured gold<br> Again he saw; a naked girl with wings<br> Enfolded in a serpent's scaly rings.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even as his eyes were fixed on it<br> A woman's voice came from the other side,<br> And through his heart strange hopes began to flit<br> That in some wondrous land he might abide<br> Not dying, master of a deathless bride,<br> So o&#146;er the gold he scarcely now could see<br> He went, and passed this last door eagerly. <A NAME="page_513"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 513</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in a room he stood wherein there was<br> A marble bath, whose brimming water yet<br> Was scarcely still; a vessel of green glass<br> Half-full of odorous ointment was there set<br> Upon the topmost step that still was wet,<br> And jewelled shoes and women's dainty gear,<br> Lay cast upon the varied pavement near.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one quick glance these things his eyes did see,<br> But speedily they turned round to behold<br> Another sight, for throned on ivory<br> There sat a girl, whose dripping tresses rolled<br> On to the floor in waves of gleaming gold,<br> Cast back from such a form as, erewhile shown<br> To one poor shepherd, lighted up Troy town.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naked she was, the kisses of her feet<br> Upon the floor a dying path had made<br> From the full bath unto her ivory seat;<br> In her right hand, upon her bosom laid,<br> She held a golden comb, a mirror weighed<br> Her left hand down, aback her fair head lay<br> Dreaming awake of some long vanished day.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her eyes were shut, but she seemed not to sleep,<br> Her lips were murmuring things unheard and low,<br> Or sometimes twitched as though she needs must weep<br> Though from her eyes the tears refused to flow,<br> And oft with heavenly red her cheek did glow, <A NAME="page_514"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 514</FONT></A><br> As if remembrance of some half-sweet shame<br> Across the web of many memories came.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood the man, scarce daring to draw breath<br> For fear the lovely sight should fade away;<br> Forgetting heaven, forgetting life and death,<br> Trembling for fear lest something he should say<br> Unwitting, lest some sob should yet betray<br> His presence there, for to his eager eyes<br> Already did the tears begin to rise.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as he gazed she moved, and with a sigh<br> Bent forward, dropping down her golden head;<br> "Alas, alas! another day gone by,<br> Another day and no soul come," she said;<br> "Another year, and still I am not dead!"<br> And with that word once more her head she raised,<br> And on the trembling man with great eyes gazed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he imploring hands to her did reach,<br> And toward her very slowly &#146;gan to move<br> And with wet eyes her pity did beseech,<br> And seeing her about to speak he strove<br> From trembling lips to utter words of love;<br> But with a look she stayed his doubtful feet,<br> And made sweet music as their eyes did meet.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now she spoke in gentle voice and clear,<br> Using the Greek tongue that he knew full well; <A NAME="page_515"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 515</FONT></A><br> "What man art thou, that thus hast wandered here,<br> And found this lonely chamber where I dwell?<br> Beware, beware! for I have many a spell;<br> If greed of power and gold have led thee on,<br> Not lightly shall this untold wealth be won.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if thou com&#146;st here, knowing of my tale,<br> In hope to bear away my body fair,<br> Stout must thine heart be, nor shall that avail<br> If thou a wicked heart in thee dost bear;<br> So once again I bid thee to beware,<br> Because no base man things like this may see,<br> And live thereafter long and happily."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lady," he said, "in Florence is my home,<br> And in my city noble is my name;<br> Neither on peddling voyage am I come,<br> But, like my fathers, bent to gather fame;<br> And though thy face has set my heart a-flame<br> Yet of thy story nothing do I know,<br> But here have wandered heedlessly enow.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But since the sight of thee mine eyes did bless,<br> What can I be but thine? what wouldst thou have?<br> From those thy words, I deem from some distress<br> By deeds of mine thy dear life I might save;<br> O then, delay not! if one ever gave<br> His life to any, mine I give to thee;<br> Come, tell me what the price of love must be? <A NAME="page_516"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 516</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Swift death, to be with thee a day and night<br> And with the earliest dawning to be slain?<br> Or better, a long year of great delight,<br> And many years of misery and pain?<br> Or worse, and this poor hour for all my gain?<br> A sorry merchant am I on this day,<br> E&#146;en as thou wiliest so must I obey."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said, "What brave words! nought divine am I,<br> But an unhappy and unheard-of maid<br> Compelled by evil fate and destiny<br> To live, who long ago should have been laid<br> Under the earth within the cypress shade.<br> Hearken awhile, and quickly shalt thou know<br> What deed I pray thee to accomplish now.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God grant indeed thy words are not for nought!<br> Then shalt thou save me, since for many a day<br> To such a dreadful life I have been brought:<br> Nor will I spare with all my heart to pay<br> What man soever takes my grief away;<br> Ah! I will love thee, if thou lovest me<br> But well enough my saviour now to be.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My father lived a many years agone<br> Lord of this land, master of all cunning,<br> Who ruddy gold could draw from out grey stone,<br> And gather wealth from many an uncouth thing,<br> He made the wilderness rejoice and sing, <A NAME="page_517"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 517</FONT></A><br> And such a leech he was that none could say<br> Without his word what soul should pass away.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto Diana such a gift he gave,<br> Goddess above, below, and on the earth,<br> That I should be her virgin and her slave<br> From the first hour of my most wretched birth;<br> Therefore my life had known but little mirth<br> When I had come unto my twentieth year<br> And the last time of hallowing drew anear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So in her temple had I lived and died<br> And all would long ago have passed away,<br> But ere that time came, did strange things betide,<br> Whereby I am alive unto this day;<br> Alas, the bitter words that I must say!<br> Ah! can I bring my wretched tongue to tell<br> How I was brought unto this fearful hell.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A queen I was, what gods I knew I loved,<br> And nothing evil was there in my thought,<br> And yet by love my wretched heart was moved<br> Until to utter ruin I was brought!<br> Alas! thou sayest our gods were vain and nought,<br> Wait, wait, till thou hast heard this tale of mine,<br> Then shalt thou think them devilish or divine.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hearken! in spite of father and of vow<br> I loved a man; but for that sin I think <A NAME="page_518"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 518</FONT></A><br> Men had forgiven me&#151;yea, yea, even thou;<br> But from the gods the full cup must I drink,<br> And into misery unheard-of sink,<br> Tormented when their own names are forgot,<br> And men must doubt if they e&#146;er lived or not.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Glorious my lover was unto my sight,<br> Most beautiful,&#151;of love we grew so fain<br> That we at last agreed, that on a night<br> We should be happy, but that he were slain<br> Or shut in hold, and neither joy nor pain<br> Should else forbid that hoped-for time to be;<br> So came the night that made a wretch of me.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! well do I remember all that night,<br> When through the window shone the orb of June,<br> And by the bed flickered the taper's light,<br> Whereby I trembled, gazing at the moon:<br> Ah me! the meeting that we had, when soon<br> Into his strong, well-trusted anus I fell,<br> And many a sorrow we began to tell.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah me! what parting on that night we had!<br> I think the story of my great despair<br> A little while might merry folk make sad;<br> For, as he swept away my yellow hair&#151;<br> To make my shoulder and my bosom bare,<br> I raised mine eyes, and shuddering could behold<br> A shadow cast upon the bed of gold: <A NAME="page_519"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 519</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then suddenly was quenched my hot desire<br> And he untwined his arms; the moon so pale<br> A while ago, seemed changed to blood and fire,<br> And yet my limbs beneath me did not fail,<br> And neither had I strength to cry or wail,<br> But stood there helpless, bare, and shivering,<br> With staring eyes still fixed upon the thing.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Because the shade that on the bed of gold<br> The changed and dreadful moon was throwing down<br> Was of Diana, whom I did behold,<br> With knotted hair, and shining girt-up gown,<br> And on the high white brow, a deadly frown<br> Bent upon us, who stood scarce drawing breath,<br> Striving to meet the horrible sure death,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No word at all the dreadful goddess said,<br> But soon across my feet my lover lay,<br> And well indeed I knew that he was dead;<br> And would that I had died on that same day!<br> For in a while the image turned away,<br> And without words my doom I understood,<br> And felt a horror change my natural blood.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And there I fell, and on the floor I lay<br> By the dead man, till daylight came on me,<br> And not a word thenceforward could I say<br> For three years, till of grief and misery,<br> The lingering pest, the cruel enemy, <A NAME="page_520"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 520</FONT></A><br> My father and his folk were dead and gone,<br> And in this castle I was left alone:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then the doom foreseen upon me fell<br> For Queen Diana did my body change<br> Into a fork-tongued dragon flesh and fell,<br> And through the island nightly do I range,<br> Or in the green sea mate with monsters strange,<br> When in the middle of the moonlit night<br> The sleepy mariner I do afright.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But all day long upon this gold I lie<br> Within this place, where never mason's hand<br> Smote trowel on the marble noisily;<br> Drowsy I lie, no folk at my command,<br> Who once was called the Lady of the Land;<br> Who might have bought a kingdom with a kiss,<br> Yea, half the world with such a sight as this."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therewithal, with rosy fingers light,<br> Backward her heavy-hanging hair she threw,<br> To give her naked beauty more to sight;<br> But when, forgetting all the things he knew,<br> Maddened with love unto the prize he drew,<br> She cried, "Nay, wait! for wherefore wilt thou die,<br> Why should we not be happy, thou and I?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wilt thou not save me? once in every year<br> This rightful form of mine that thou dost see <A NAME="page_521"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 521</FONT></A><br> By favour of the goddess have I here<br> From sunrise unto sunset given me,<br> That some brave man may end my misery.<br> And thou&#151;art thou not brave? can thy heart fail,<br> Whose eyes e&#146;en now are weeping at my tale?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then listen! when this day is overpast,<br> A fearful monster shall I be again,<br> And thou mayst be my saviour at the last,<br> Unless, once more, thy words are nought and vain;<br> If thou of love and sovereignty art fain,<br> Come thou next morn, and when thou seest here<br> A hideous dragon, have thereof no fear,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But take the loathsome head up in thine hands,<br> And kiss it, and be master presently<br> Of twice the wealth that is in all the lands,<br> From Cathay to the head of Italy;<br> And master also, if it pleaseth thee,<br> Of all thou praisest as so fresh and bright,<br> Of what thou callest crown of all delight.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah! with what joy then shall I see again<br> The sunlight on the green grass and the trees,<br> And hear the clatter of the summer rain,<br> And see the joyous folk beyond the seas.<br> Ah, me! to hold my child upon my knees,<br> After the weeping of unkindly tears,<br> And all the wrongs of these four hundred years. <A NAME="page_522"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 522</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go now, go quick! leave this grey heap of stone;<br> And from thy glad heart think upon thy way,<br> How I shall love thee&#151;yea, love thee alone,<br> That bringest me from dark death unto day;<br> For this shall be thy wages and thy pay;<br> Unheard-of wealth, unheard-of love is near,<br> If thou hast heart a little dread to bear."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith she turned to go; but he cried out,<br> "Ah! wilt thou leave me then without one kiss,<br> To slay the very seeds of doubt and fear,<br> That glad to-morrow may bring certain bliss?<br> Hast thou forgotten how love lives by this,<br> The memory of some hopeful close embrace,<br> Low whispered words within some lonely place?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she, when his bright glittering eyes she saw,<br> And burning cheeks, cried out, "Alas, alas!<br> Must I be quite undone, and wilt thou draw<br> A worse fate on me than the first one was?<br> O haste thee from this fatal place to pass!<br> Yet, ere thou goest, take this, lest thou shouldst deem<br> Thou hast been fooled by some strange midday dream.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So saying, blushing like a new-kissed maid,<br> From off her neck a little gem she drew,<br> That, &#146;twixt those snowy rose-tinged hillocks laid,<br> The secrets of her glorious beauty knew;<br> And ere he well perceived what she would do, <A NAME="page_523"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 523</FONT></A><br> She touched his hand, the gem within it lay,<br> And, turning, from his sight she fled away.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then at the doorway where her rosy heel<br> Had glanced and vanished, he awhile did stare,<br> And still upon his hand he seemed to feel<br> The varying kisses of her fingers fair;<br> Then turned he toward the dreary crypt and bare,<br> And dizzily throughout the castle passed,<br> Till by the ruined fane he stood at last.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then weighing still the gem within his hand,<br> He stumbled backward though the cypress wood,<br> Thinking the while of some strange lovely land,<br> Where all his life should be most fair and good;<br> Till on the valley's wall of hills he stood,<br> And slowly thence passed down unto the bay<br> Red with the death of that bewildering day.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>THE next day came, and he, who all the night<br> Had ceaselessly been turning in his bed,<br> Arose and clad himself in armour bright,<br> And many a danger he remembered;<br> Storming of towns, lone sieges full of dread,<br> That with renown his heart had borne him through,<br> And this thing seemed a little thing to do. <A NAME="page_524"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 524</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on he went, and on the way he thought<br> Of all the glorious things of yesterday,<br> Nought of the price whereat they must be bought,<br> But ever to himself did softly say,<br> "No roaming now, my wars are passed away,<br> No long dull days devoid of happiness,<br> When such a love my yearning heart shall bless."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus to the castle did he come at last,<br> But when unto the gateway he drew near,<br> And underneath its ruined archway passed<br> Into the court, a strange noise did he hear,<br> And through his heart there shot a pang of fear,<br> Trembling, he gat his sword into his hand,<br> And midmost of the cloisters took his stand.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for a while that unknown noise increased<br> A rattling, that with strident roars did blend,<br> And whining moans; but suddenly it ceased,<br> A fearful thing stood at the cloister's end,<br> And eyed him for a while, then gan to wend<br> Adown the cloisters, and began again<br> That rattling, and the moan like fiends in pain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as it came on towards him, with its teeth<br> The body of a slain goat did it tear,<br> The blood whereof in its hot jaws did seethe,<br> And on its tongue he saw the smoking hair;<br> Then his heart sank, and standing trembling there, <A NAME="page_525"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 525</FONT></A><br> Throughout his mind wild thoughts and fearful ran,<br> "Some fiend she was," he said, "the bane of man."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet he abode her still, although his blood<br> Curdled within him: the thing dropped the goat,<br> And creeping on, came close to where he stood,<br> And raised its head to him, and wrinkled throat,<br> Then he cried out and wildly at her smote,<br> Shutting his eyes, and turned and from the place<br> Ran swiftly, with a white and ghastly face.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But little things rough stones and tree-trunks seemed,<br> And if he fell, he rose and ran on still;<br> No more he felt his hurts than if he dreamed,<br> He made no stay for valley or steep hill,<br> Heedless he dashed through many a foaming rill,<br> Until he came unto the ship at last<br> And with no word into the deep hold passed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the dragon, seeing him clean gone,<br> Followed him not, but crying horribly,<br> Caught up within her jaws a block of stone<br> And ground it into powder, then turned she,<br> With cries that folk could hear far out at sea,<br> And reached the treasure set apart of old,<br> To brood above the hidden heaps of gold.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet was she seen again on many a day<br> By some half-waking mariner, or herd, <A NAME="page_526"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 526</FONT></A><br> Playing amid the ripples of the bay,<br> Or on the hills making all things afeard,<br> Or in the wood, that did that castle gird,<br> But never any man again durst go<br> To seek her woman's form, and end her woe.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the man, who knows what things he bore?<br> What mournful faces peopled the sad night,<br> What wailings vexed him with reproaches sore,<br> What images of that nigh-gained delight!<br> What dreamed caresses from soft hands and white,<br> Turning to horrors ere they reached the best,<br> What struggles vain, what shame, what huge unrest?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No man he knew, three days he lay and raved,<br> And cried for death, until a lethargy<br> Fell on him, and his fellows thought him saved;<br> But on the third day he awoke to die;<br> And at Byzantium doth his body lie<br> Between two blossoming pomegranate trees,<br> Within the churchyard of the Genoese.</p>

<p>A MOMENT'S silence as his tale had end,<br> And then the wind of that June night did blend<br> Their varied voices, as of that and this<br> They fell to talk: of those fair islands' bliss<br> They knew in other days, of hope they had<br> To live there long an easy life and glad,<br> With nought to vex them; and the younger men<br> Began to nourish strange dreams even then<br> Of sailing east, as these had once sailed west;<br> Because the story of that luckless quest<br> With hope, not fear, had filled their joyous hearts<br> And made them dream of new and noble parts<br> That they might act; of raising up the name<br> Their fathers bore, and winning boundless fame.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These too with little patience seemed to hear,<br> That story end with shame and grief and fear;<br> A little thing the man had had to do,<br> They said, if longing burned within him so.<br> But at their words the older men must bow<br> Their heads, and, smiling, somewhat thoughtful grow,<br> Remembering well how fear in days gone by<br> Had dealt with them, and poisoned wretchedly<br> Good days, good deeds, and longings for all good:<br> Yet on the evil times they would not brood,<br> But sighing, strove to raise the weight of years,<br> And no more memory of their hopes and fears<br> They nourished, but such gentle thoughts as fed<br> The pensiveness the lovely season bred.</p>
