<p>JUNE, O June, that we desired so,<br> Wilt thou not make us happy on this day?<br> Across the river thy soft breezes blow<br> Sweet with the scent of beanfields far away,<br> Above our heads rustle the aspens grey,<br> Calm is the sky with harmless clouds beset,<br> No thought of storm the morning vexes yet.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, we have left our hopes and fears behind<br> To give our very hearts up unto thee;<br> What better place than this then could we find<br> By this sweet stream that knows not of the sea,<br> That guesses not the city's misery,<br> This little stream whose hamlets scarce have names,<br> This far-off, lonely mother of the Thames?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here then, O June, thy kindness will we take;<br> And if indeed but pensive men we seem,<br> What should we do? thou wouldst not have us wake<br> From out the arms of this rare happy dream,<br> And wish to leave the murmur of the stream,<br> The rustling boughs, the twitter of the birds,<br> And all thy thousand peaceful happy words.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>NOW in the early June they deemed it good<br> That they should go unto a house that stood<br> On their chief river, so upon a day<br> With favouring wind and tide they took their way<br> Up the fair stream; most lovely was the time<br> Even amidst the days of that fair clime,<br> And still the wanderers thought about their lives,<br> And that desire that rippling water gives<br> To youthful hearts to wander anywhere.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So midst sweet sights and sounds a house most fair<br> They came to, set upon the river side<br> Where kindly folk their coming did abide;<br> There they took land, and in the lime-trees&#146; shade<br> Beneath the trees they found the fair feast laid,<br> And sat, well pleased; but when the water-hen<br> Had got at last to think them harmless men,<br> And they with rest, and pleasure, and old wine,<br> Began to feel immortal and divine,<br> An elder spoke, "O gentle friends, the day<br> Amid such calm delight now slips away,<br> And ye yourselves are grown so bright and glad<br> I care not if I tell you something sad;<br> Sad, though the life I tell you of passed by,<br> Unstained by sordid strife or misery;<br> Sad, because though a glorious end it tells<br> Yet on the end of glorious life it dwells,<br> And striving through all things to reach the best<br> Upon no midway happiness will rest."</p>
