<p><A NAME="page_107"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 107</FONT></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">ATALANTA'S RACE.</h3>  <h4 align="center">ARGUMENT.</h4>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">ATALANTA, daughter of King Sch&#156;neus, not willing to lose her virgin's estate, made it a law to all suitors that they should run a race with her in the public place, and if they failed to overcome her should die unrevenged; and thus many brave men perished. At last came Milanion, the son of Amphidamas, who, outrunning her with the help of Venus, gained the virgin and wedded her.</FONT></p>  
<p>THROUGH thick Arcadian woods a hunter went,<br> Following the beasts up, on a fresh spring day;<br> But since his horn-tipped bow but seldom bent,<br> Now at the noontide nought had happed to slay,<br> Within a vale he called his hounds away,<br> Hearkening the echoes of his lone voice cling<br> About the cliffs and through the beech-trees ring.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when they ended, still awhile he stood,<br> And but the sweet familiar thrush could hear,<br> And all the day-long noises of the wood,<br> And o&#146;er the dry leaves of the vanished year<br> His hounds' feet pattering as they drew anear,<br> And heavy breathing from their heads low hung,<br> To see the mighty cornel bow unstrung. <A NAME="page_108"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 108</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then smiling did he turn to leave the place,<br> But with his first step some new fleeting thought<br> A shadow cast across his sun-burnt face;<br> I think the golden net that April brought<br> From some warm world his wavering soul had caught;<br> For, sunk in vague sweet longing, did he go<br> Betwixt the trees with doubtful steps and slow.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet howsoever slow he went, at last<br> The trees grew sparser, and the wood was done;<br> Whereon one farewell, backward look he cast,<br> Then, turning round to see what place was won,<br> With shaded eyes looked underneath the sun,<br> And o&#146;er green meads and new-turned furrows brown<br> Beheld the gleaming of King Sch&#156;neus&#146; town.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So thitherward he turned, and on each side<br> The folk were busy on the teeming land,<br> And man and maid from the brown furrows cried,<br> Or midst the newly-blossomed vines did stand,<br> And as the rustic weapon pressed the hand<br> Thought of the nodding of the well-filled ear,<br> Or how the knife the heavy bunch should shear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merry it was: about him sung the birds,<br> The spring flowers bloomed along the firm dry road,<br> The sleek-skinned mothers of the sharp-horned herds<br> Now for the barefoot milking-maidens lowed;<br> While from the freshness of his blue abode, <A NAME="page_109"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 109</FONT></A><br> Glad his death-bearing arrows to forget,<br> The broad sun blazed, nor scattered plagues as yet.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through such fair things unto the gates he came,<br> And found them open, as though peace were there;<br> Wherethrough, unquestioned of his race or name,<br> He entered, and along the streets &#146;gan fare,<br> Which at the first of folk were well-nigh bare;<br> But pressing on, and going more hastily,<br> Men hurrying too he &#146;gan at last to see.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the last of these, he still pressed on,<br> Until an open space he came unto,<br> Where wreaths of fame had oft been lost and won,<br> For feats of strength folk there were wont to do.<br> And now our hunter looked for something new,<br> Because the whole wide space was bare, and stilled<br> The high seats were, with eager people filled.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There with the others to a seat he gat,<br> Whence he beheld a broidered canopy,<br> Neath which in fair array King Sch&#156;neus sat<br> Upon his throne with councillors thereby;<br> And underneath this well-wrought seat and high,<br> He saw a golden image of the sun,<br> A silver image of the Fleet-foot One.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brazen altar stood beneath their feet<br> Whereon a thin flame flickered in the wind; <A NAME="page_110"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 110</FONT></A><br> Nigh this a herald clad in raiment meet<br> Made ready even now his horn to wind,<br> By whom a huge man held a sword, entwined<br> With yellow flowers; these stood a little space<br> From off the altar, nigh the starting place.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there two runners did the sign abide<br> Foot set to foot,&#151;a young man slim and fair,<br> Crisp-haired, well knit, with firm limbs often tried<br> In places where no man his strength may spare;<br> Dainty his thin coat was, and on his hair<br> A golden circlet of renown he wore,<br> And in his hand an olive garland bore.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on this day with whom shall he contend?<br> A maid stood by him like Diana clad<br> When in the woods she lists her bow to bend,<br> Too fair for one to look on and be glad,<br> Who scarcely yet has thirty summers had,<br> If he must still behold her from afar;<br> Too fair to let the world live free from war.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She seemed all earthly matters to forget;<br> Of all tormenting lines her face was clear,<br> Her wide grey eyes upon the goal were set<br> Calm and unmoved as though no soul were near,<br> But her foe trembled as a man in fear,<br> Nor from her loveliness one moment turned<br> His anxious face with fierce desire that burned. <A NAME="page_111"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 111</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now through the hush there broke the trumpet's clang<br> Just as the setting sun made eventide.<br> Then from light feet a spurt of dust there sprang,<br> And swiftly were they running side by side;<br> But silent did the thronging folk abide<br> Until the turning-post was reached at last,<br> And round about it still abreast they passed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the people saw how close they ran,<br> When halfway to the starting-point they were,<br> A cry of joy broke forth, whereat the man<br> Headed the white-foot runner, and drew near<br> Unto the very end of all his fear;<br> And scarce his straining feet the ground could feel,<br> And bliss unhoped for o&#146;er his heart &#146;gan steal.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But midst the loud victorious shouts he heard<br> Her footsteps drawing nearer, and the sound<br> Of fluttering raiment, and thereat afeard<br> His flushed and eager face he turned around,<br> And even then he felt her past him bound<br> Fleet as the wind, but scarcely saw her there<br> Till on the goal she laid her fingers fair.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood she breathing like a little child<br> Amid some warlike clamour laid asleep,<br> For no victorious joy her red lips smiled,<br> Her cheek its wonted freshness did but keep;<br> No glance lit up her clear grey eyes and deep, <A NAME="page_112"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 112</FONT></A><br> Though some divine thought softened all her face<br> As once more rang the trumpet through the place.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But her late foe stopped short amidst his course,<br> One moment gazed upon her piteously,<br> Then with a groan his lingering feet did force<br> To leave the spot whence he her eyes could see;<br> And, changed like one who knows his time must be<br> But short and bitter, without any word<br> He knelt before the bearer of the sword;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then high rose up the gleaming deadly blade,<br> Bared of its flowers, and through the crowded place<br> Was silence now, and midst of it the maid<br> Went by the poor wretch at a gentle pace,<br> And he to hers upturned his sad white face;<br> Nor did his eyes behold another sight<br> Ere on his soul there fell eternal night.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>SO was the pageant ended, and all folk<br> Talking of this and that familiar thing<br> In little groups from that sad concourse broke,<br> For now the shrill bats were upon the wing,<br> And soon dark night would slay the evening,<br> And in dark gardens sang the nightingale<br> Her little-heeded, oft-repeated tale. <A NAME="page_113"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 113</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the last of all the hunter went,<br> Who, wondering at the strange sight he had seen,<br> Prayed an old man to tell him what it meant,<br> Both why the vanquished man so slain had been,<br> And if the maiden were an earthly queen,<br> Or rather what much more she seemed to be,<br> No sharer in the world's mortality.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stranger," said he, "I pray she soon may die<br> Whose lovely youth has slain so many an one!<br> King Sch&#156;neus&#146; daughter is she verily,<br> Who when her eyes first looked upon the sun<br> Was fain to end her life but new begun,<br> For he had vowed to leave but men alone<br> Sprung from his loins when he from earth was gone.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therefore he bade one leave her in the wood,<br> And let wild things deal with her as they might,<br> But this being done, some cruel god thought good<br> To save her beauty in the world's despite:<br> Folk say that her, so delicate and white<br> As now she is, a rough root-grubbing bear<br> Amidst her shapeless cubs at first did rear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In course of time the woodfolk slew her nurse,<br> And to their rude abode the youngling brought,<br> And reared her up to be a kingdom's curse,<br> Who grown a woman, of no kingdom thought,<br> But armed and swift, &#146;mid beasts destruction wrought, <A NAME="page_114"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 114</FONT></A><br> Nor spared two shaggy centaur kings to slay<br> To whom her body seemed an easy prey.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So to this city, led by fate, she came<br> Whom known by signs, whereof I cannot tell,<br> King Sch&#156;neus for his child at last did claim,<br> Nor otherwhere since that day doth she dwell<br> Sending too many a noble soul to hell&#151;<br> What! thine eyes glisten! what then, thinkest thou<br> Her shining head unto the yoke to bow?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Listen, my son, and love some other maid<br> For she the saffron gown will never wear,<br> And on no flower-strewn couch shall she be laid,<br> Nor shall her voice make glad a lover's ear:<br> Yet if of Death thou hast not any fear,<br> Yea, rather, if thou lovest him utterly,<br> Thou still may&#146;st woo her ere thou comest to die,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Like him that on this day thou sawest lie dead;<br> For, fearing as I deem the sea-born one,<br> The maid has vowed e&#146;en such a man to wed<br> As in the course her swift feet can outrun,<br> But whoso fails herein, his days are done:<br> He came the nighest that was slain to-day,<br> Although with him I deem she did but play.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Behold, such mercy Atalanta gives<br> To those that long to win her loveliness; <A NAME="page_115"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 115</FONT></A><br> Be wise! be sure that many a maid there lives<br> Gentler than she, of beauty little less,<br> Whose swimming eyes thy loving words shall bless,<br> When in some garden, knee set close to knee,<br> Thou sing&#146;st the song that love may teach to thee."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to the hunter spake that ancient man,<br> And left him for his own home presently:<br> But he turned round, and through the moonlight wan<br> Reached the thick wood, and there &#146;twixt tree and tree<br> Distraught he passed the long night feverishly,<br> &#146;Twixt sleep and waking, and at dawn arose<br> To wage hot war against his speechless foes.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There to the hart's flank seemed his shaft to grow,<br> As panting down the broad green glades he flew,<br> There by his horn the Dryads well might know<br> His thrust against the bear's heart had been true,<br> And there Adonis' bane his javelin slew,<br> But still in vain through rough and smooth he went,.<br> For none the more his restlessness was spent.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So wandering, he to Argive cities came,<br> And in the lists with valiant men he stood,<br> And by great deeds he won him praise and fame,<br> And heaps of wealth for little-valued blood;<br> But none of all these things, or life, seemed good<br> Unto his heart, where still unsatisfied<br> A ravenous longing warred with fear and pride. <A NAME="page_116"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 116</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore it happed when but a month had gone<br> Since he had left King Sch&#156;neus&#146; city old,<br> In hunting-gear again, again alone<br> The forest-bordered meads did he behold,<br> Where still mid thoughts of August's quivering gold<br> Folk hoed the wheat, and clipped the vine in trust<br> Of faint October's purple-foaming must.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And once again he passed the peaceful gate,<br> While to his beating heart his lips did lie,<br> That owning not victorious love and fate,<br> Said, half aloud, "And here too must I try,<br> To win of alien men the mastery,<br> And gather for my head fresh meed of fame<br> And cast new glory on my father's name."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of that, how beat his heart, when first<br> Folk said to him, "And art thou come to see<br> That which still makes our city's name accurst<br> Among all mothers for its cruelty?<br> Then know indeed that fate is good to thee<br> Because to-morrow a new luckless one<br> Against the whitefoot maid is pledged to run."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on the morrow with no curious eyes<br> As once he did, that piteous sight he saw,<br> Nor did that wonder in his heart arise<br> As toward the goal the conquering maid &#146;gan draw,<br> Nor did he gaze upon her eyes with awe, <A NAME="page_117"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 117</FONT></A><br> Too full the pain of longing filled his heart<br> For fear or wonder there to have a part.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But O, how long the night was ere it went!<br> How long it was before the dawn begun<br> Showed to the wakening birds the sun's intent<br> That not in darkness should the world be done!<br> And then, and then, how long before the sun<br> Bade silently the toilers of the earth<br> Get forth to fruitless cares or empty mirth!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And long it seemed that in the market-place<br> He stood and saw the chaffering folk go by,<br> Ere from the ivory throne King Sch&#156;neus&#146; face<br> Looked down upon the murmur royally,<br> But then came trembling that the time was nigh<br> When he midst pitying looks his love must claim,<br> And jeering voices must salute his name.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as the throng he pierced to gain the throne,<br> His alien face distraught and anxious told<br> What hopeless errand he was bound upon,<br> And, each to each, folk whispered to behold<br> His godlike limbs; nay, and one woman old<br> As he went by must pluck him by the sleeve<br> And pray him yet that wretched love to leave.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For sidling up she said, "Canst thou live twice,<br> Fair son? canst thou have joyful youth again, <A NAME="page_118"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 118</FONT></A><br> That thus thou goest to the sacrifice<br> Thyself the victim? nay then, all in vain<br> Thy mother bore her longing and her pain,<br> And one more maiden on the earth must dwell<br> Hopeless of joy, nor fearing death and hell.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O, fool, thou knowest not the compact then<br> That with the threeformed goddess she has made<br> To keep her from the loving lips of men,<br> And in no saffron gown to be arrayed,<br> And therewithal with glory to be paid,<br> And love of her the moonlit river sees<br> White &#146;gainst the shadow of the formless trees.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come back, and I myself will pray for thee<br> Unto the sea-born framer of delights,<br> To give thee her who on the earth may be<br> The fairest stirrer up to death and fights,<br> To quench with hopeful days and joyous nights<br> The flame that doth thy youthful heart consume:<br> Come back, nor give thy beauty to the tomb."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How should he listen to her earnest speech?<br> Words, such as he not once or twice had said<br> Unto himself, whose meaning scarce could reach<br> The firm abode of that sad hardihead&#151;<br> He turned about, and through the marketstead<br> Swiftly he passed, until before the throne<br> In the cleared space he stood at last alone. <A NAME="page_119"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 119</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said the King, "Stranger, what dost thou here?<br> Have any of my folk done ill to thee?<br> Or art thou of the forest men in fear?<br> Or art thou of the sad fraternity<br> Who still will strive my daughter's mates to be,<br> Staking their lives to win to earthly bliss<br> The lonely maid, the friend of Artemis?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O King," he said, "thou sayest the word indeed;<br> Nor will I quit the strife till I have won<br> My sweet delight, or death to end my need.<br> And know that I am called Milanion,<br> Of King Amphidamas the well-loved son<br> So fear not that to thy old name, O King,<br> Much loss or shame my victory will bring."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, Prince," said Sch&#156;neus, "welcome to this land<br> Thou wert indeed, if thou wert here to try<br> Thy strength &#146;gainst some one mighty of his hand;<br> Nor would we grudge thee well-won mastery.<br> But now, why wilt thou come to me to die,<br> And at my door lay down thy luckless head,<br> Swelling the band of the unhappy dead,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whose curses even now my heart doth fear?<br> Lo, I am old, and know what life can be,<br> And what a bitter thing is death anear.<br> O Son! be wise, and hearken unto me,<br> And if no other can be dear to thee, <A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A><br> At least as now, yet is the world full wide,<br> And bliss in seeming hopeless hearts may hide:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if thou losest life, then all is lost."<br> "Nay, King," Milanion said, "thy words are vain.<br> Doubt not that I have counted well the cost.<br> But say, on what day wilt thou that I gain<br> Fulfilled delight, or death to end my pain?<br> Right glad were I if it could be to-day,<br> And all my doubts at rest for ever lay."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay," said King Sch&#156;neus, "thus it shall not be,<br> But rather shalt thou let a month go by,<br> And weary with thy prayers for victory<br> What god thou know&#146;st the kindest and most nigh.<br> So doing, still perchance thou shalt not die:<br> And with my goodwill wouldst thou have the maid,<br> For of the equal gods I grow afraid.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And until then, O Prince, be thou my guest,<br> And all these troublous things awhile forget."<br> "Nay," said he, "couldst thou give my soul good rest,<br> And on mine head a sleepy garland set,<br> Then had I &#146;scaped the meshes of the net,<br> Nor shouldst thou hear from me another word;<br> But now, make sharp thy fearful heading sword.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yet will I do what son of man may do,<br> And promise all the gods may most desire, <A NAME="page_121"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 121</FONT></A><br> That to myself I may at least be true;<br> And on that day my heart and limbs so tire,<br> With utmost strain and measureless desire,<br> That, at the worst, I may but fall asleep<br> When in the sunlight round that sword shall sweep."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went with that, nor anywhere would bide,<br> But unto Argos restlessly did wend;<br> And there, as one who lays all hope aside,<br> Because the leech has said his life must end,<br> Silent farewell he bade to foe and friend,<br> And took his way unto the restless sea,<br> For there he deemed his rest and help might be.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>UPON the shore of Argolis there stands<br> A temple to the goddess that he sought,<br> That, turned unto the lion-bearing lands,<br> Fenced from the east, of cold winds hath no thought,<br> Though to no homestead there the sheaves are brought,<br> No groaning press torments the close-clipped murk,<br> Lonely the fane stands, far from all men's work.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass through a close, set thick with myrtle trees,<br> Through the brass doors that guard the holy place,<br> And entering, hear the washing of the seas <A NAME="page_122"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 122</FONT></A><br> That twice a-day rise high above the base,<br> And with the south-west urging them, embrace<br> The marble feet of her that standeth there<br> That shrink not, naked though they be and fair.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small is the fane through which the seawind sings<br> About Queen Venus&#146; well-wrought image white,<br> But hung around are many precious things,<br> The gifts of those who, longing for delight,<br> Have hung them there within the goddess&#146; sight,<br> And in return have taken at her hands<br> The living treasures of the Grecian lands.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thither now has come Milanion,<br> And showed unto the priests' wide open eyes<br> Gifts fairer than all those that there have shone,<br> Silk cloths, inwrought with Indian fantasies,<br> And bowls inscribed with sayings of the wise<br> Above the deeds of foolish living things,<br> And mirrors fit to be the gifts of kings.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now before the Sea-born One he stands,<br> By the sweet veiling smoke made dim and soft,<br> And while the incense trickles from his hands,<br> And while the odorous smoke-wreaths hang aloft,<br> Thus Both he pray to her: "O Thou, who oft<br> Hast holpen man and maid in their distress,<br> Despise me not for this my wretchedness! <A NAME="page_123"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 123</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O goddess, among us who dwell below,<br> Kings and great men, great for a little while,<br> Have pity on the lowly heads that bow,<br> Nor hate the hearts that love them without guile;<br> Wilt thou be worse than these, and is thy smile<br> A vain device of him who set thee here,<br> An empty dream of some artificer?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O, great one, some men love, and are ashamed;<br> Some men are weary of the bonds of love;<br> Yea, and by some men lightly art thou blamed,<br> That from thy toils their lives they cannot move,<br> And &#146;mid the ranks of men their manhood prove.<br> Alas! O goddess, if thou slayest me<br> What new immortal can I serve but thee?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Think then, will it bring honour to thy head<br> If folk say, 'Everything aside he cast<br> And to all fame and honour was he dead,<br> And to his one hope now is dead at last,<br> Since all unholpen he is gone and past:<br> Ah, the gods love not man, for certainly,<br> He to his helper did not cease to cry.'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, but thou wilt help; they who died before<br> Not single-hearted as I deem came here,<br> Therefore unthanked they laid their gifts before<br> Thy stainless feet, still shivering with their fear,<br> Lest in their eyes their true thought might appear, <A NAME="page_124"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 124</FONT></A><br> Who sought to be the lords of that fair town,<br> Dreaded of men and winners of renown.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Queen, thou knowest I pray not for this:<br> O set us down together in some place<br> Where not a voice can break our heaven of bliss,<br> Where nought but rocks and I can see her face,<br> Softening beneath the marvel of thy grace,<br> Where not a foot our vanished steps can track&#151;<br> The golden age, the golden age come back!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O fairest, hear me now who do thy will,<br> Plead for thy rebel that he be not slain,<br> But live and love and be thy servant still;<br> Ah, give her joy and take away my pain,<br> And thus two long enduring servants gain.<br> An easy thing this is to do for me,<br> What need of my vain words to weary thee!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But none the less, this place will I not leave<br> Until I needs must go my death to meet,<br> Or at thy hands some happy sign receive<br> That in great joy we twain may one day greet<br> Thy presence here and kiss thy silver feet,<br> Such as we deem thee, fair beyond all words,<br> Victorious o&#146;er our servants and our lords."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from the altar back a space he drew,<br> But from the Queen turned not his face away, <A NAME="page_125"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 125</FONT></A><br> But &#146;gainst a pillar leaned, until the blue<br> That arched the sky, at ending of the day,<br> Was turned to ruddy gold and changing grey,<br> And clear, but low, the nigh-ebbed windless sea<br> In the still evening murmured ceaselessly.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there he stood when all the sun was down,<br> Nor had he moved, when the dim golden light,<br> Like the far lustre of a godlike town,<br> Had left the world to seeming hopeless night,<br> Nor would he move the more when wan moonlight<br> Streamed through the pillars for a little while,<br> And lighted up the white Queen's changeless smile.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought noted he the shallow flowing sea<br> As step by step it set the wrack a-swim,<br> The yellow torchlight nothing noted he<br> Wherein with fluttering gown and half-bared limb<br> The temple damsels sung their midnight hymn,<br> And nought the doubled stillness of the fane<br> When they were gone and all was hushed again.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the waves had touched the marble base,<br> And steps the fish swim over twice a-day,<br> The dawn beheld him sunken in his place<br> Upon the floor; and sleeping there he lay,<br> Not heeding aught the little jets of spray<br> The roughened sea brought nigh, across him cast,<br> For as one dead all thought from him had passed. <A NAME="page_126"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 126</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet long before the sun had showed his head,<br> Long ere the varied hangings on the wall<br> Had gained once more their blue and green and red,<br> He rose as one some well-known sign doth call<br> When war upon the city's gates doth fall,<br> And scarce like one fresh risen out of sleep,<br> He &#146;gan again his broken watch to keep.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he turned round; not for the sea-gull's cry<br> That wheeled above the temple in his flight,<br> Not for the fresh south wind that lovingly<br> Breathed on the new-born day and dying night,<br> But some strange hope &#146;twixt fear and great delight<br> Drew round his face, now flushed, now pale and wan,<br> And still constrained his eyes the sea to scan.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now a faint light lit up the southern sky,<br> Not sun or moon, for all the world was grey,<br> But this a bright cloud seemed, that drew anigh,<br> Lighting the dull waves that beneath it lay<br> As toward the temple still it took its way,<br> And still grew greater, till Milanion<br> Saw nought for dazzling light that round him shone.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as he staggered with his arms outspread,<br> Delicious unnamed odours breathed around,<br> For languid happiness he bowed his head,<br> And with wet eyes sank down upon the ground,<br> Nor wished for aught, nor any dream he found <A NAME="page_127"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 127</FONT></A><br> To give him reason for that happiness,<br> Or make him ask more knowledge of his bliss.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last his eyes were cleared, and he could see<br> Through happy tears the goddess face to face<br> With that faint image of Divinity,<br> Whose well-wrought smile and dainty changeless grace<br> Until that morn so gladdened all the place;<br> Then he, unwitting cried aloud her name<br> And covered up his eyes for fear and shame.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But through the stillness he her voice could hear<br> Piercing his heart with joy scarce bearable,<br> That said, "Milanion, wherefore dost thou fear,<br> I am not hard to those who love me well;<br> List to what I a second time will tell,<br> And thou mayest hear perchance, and live to save<br> The cruel maiden from a loveless grave.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"See, by my feet three golden apples lie&#151;<br> Such fruit among the heavy roses falls,<br> Such fruit my watchful damsels carefully<br> Store up within the best loved of my walls,<br> Ancient Damascus, where the lover calls<br> Above my unseen head, and faint and light<br> The rose-leaves flutter round me in the night.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And note, that these are not alone most fair<br> With heavenly gold, but longing strange they bring <A NAME="page_128"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 128</FONT></A><br> Unto the hearts of men, who will not care<br> Beholding these, for any once-loved thing<br> Till round the shining sides their fingers cling.<br> And thou shalt see thy well-girt swiftfoot maid<br> By sight of these amid her glory stayed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For bearing these within a scrip with thee,<br> When first she heads thee from the starting-place<br> Cast down the first one for her eyes to see,<br> And when she turns aside make on apace,<br> And if again she heads thee in the race<br> Spare not the other two to cast aside<br> If she not long enough behind will bide.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell, and when has come the happy time<br> That she Diana's raiment must unbind<br> And all the world seems blessed with Saturn's clime,<br> And thou with eager arms about her twined<br> Beholdest first her grey eyes growing kind,<br> Surely, O trembler, thou shalt scarcely then<br> Forget the Helper of unhappy men."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milanion raised his head at this last word<br> For now so soft and kind she seemed to be<br> No longer of her Godhead was he feared;<br> Too late he looked, for nothing could he see<br> But the white image glimmering doubtfully<br> In the departing twilight cold and grey,<br> And those three apples on the steps that lay. <A NAME="page_129"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 129</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These then he caught up quivering with delight,<br> Yet fearful lest it all might be a dream,<br> And though aweary with the watchful night,<br> And sleepless nights of longing, still did deem<br> He could not sleep; but yet the first sun-beam<br> That smote the fane across the heaving deep<br> Shone on him laid in calm untroubled sleep.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But little ere the noontide did he rise,<br> And why he felt so happy scarce could tell<br> Until the gleaming apples met his eyes.<br> Then leaving the fair place where this befell<br> Oft he looked back as one who loved it well,<br> Then homeward to the haunts of men &#146;gan wend<br> To bring all things unto a happy end.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>NOW has the lingering month at last gone by,<br> Again are all folk round the running place,<br> Nor other seems the dismal pageantry<br> Than heretofore, but that another face<br> Looks o&#146;er the smooth course ready for the race,<br> For now, beheld of all, Milanion<br> Stands on the spot he twice has looked upon.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yet&#151;what change is this that holds the maid?<br> Does she indeed see in his glittering eye <A NAME="page_130"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 130</FONT></A><br> More than disdain of the sharp shearing blade,<br> Some happy hope of help and victory?<br> The others seemed to say, "We come to die,<br> Look down upon us for a little while,<br> That dead, we may bethink us of thy smile."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he&#151;what look of mastery was this<br> He cast on her? why were his lips so red?<br> Why was his face so flushed with happiness?<br> So looks not one who deems himself but dead,<br> E&#146;en if to death he bows a willing head;<br> So rather looks a god well pleased to find<br> Some earthly damsel fashioned to his mind.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why must she drop her lids before his gaze,<br> And even as she casts adown her eyes<br> Redden to note his eager glance of praise,<br> And wish that she were clad in other guise?<br> Why must the memory to her heart arise<br> Of things unnoticed when they first were heard,<br> Some lover's song, some answering maiden's word?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes these longings, vague, without a name,<br> And this vain pity never felt before,<br> This sudden languor, this contempt of fame,<br> This tender sorrow for the time past o&#146;er,<br> These doubts that grow each minute more and more?<br> Why does she tremble as the time grows near,<br> And weak defeat and woeful victory fear? <A NAME="page_131"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 131</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while she seemed to hear her beating heart,<br> Above their heads the trumpet blast rang out<br> And forth they sprang; and she must play her part;<br> Then flew her white feet, knowing not a doubt,<br> Though slackening once, she turned her head about,<br> But then she cried aloud and faster fled<br> Than e&#146;er before, and all men deemed him dead.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with no sound he raised aloft his hand,<br> And thence what seemed a ray of light there flew<br> And past the maid rolled on along the sand;<br> Then trembling she her feet together drew<br> And in her heart a strong desire there grew<br> To have the toy; some god she thought had given<br> That gift to her, to make of earth a heaven.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from the course with eager steps she ran,<br> And in her odorous bosom laid the gold.<br> But when she turned again, the great-limbed man,<br> Now well ahead she failed not to behold,<br> And mindful of her glory waxing cold,<br> Sprang up and followed him in hot pursuit,<br> Though with one hand she touched the golden fruit.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note too, the bow that she was wont to bear<br> She laid aside to grasp the glittering prize,<br> And o&#146;er her shoulder from the quiver fair<br> Three arrows fell and lay before her eyes<br> Unnoticed, as amidst the people's cries <A NAME="page_132"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 132</FONT></A><br> She sprang to head the strong Milanion,<br> Who now the turning-post had well nigh won.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as he set his mighty hand on it<br> White fingers underneath his own were laid,<br> And white limbs from his dazzled eyes did flit,<br> Then he the second fruit cast by the maid,<br> But she ran on awhile, then as afraid<br> Wavered and stopped, and turned and made no stay,<br> Until the globe with its bright fellow lay.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as a troubled glance she cast around<br> Now far ahead the Argive could she see,<br> And in her garment's hem one hand she wound<br> To keep the double prize, and strenuously<br> Sped o&#146;er the course, and little doubt had she<br> To win the day, though now but scanty space<br> Was left betwixt him and the winning place.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short was the way unto such winged feet,<br> Quickly she gained upon him till at last<br> He turned about her eager eyes to meet<br> And from his hand the third fair apple cast.<br> She wavered not, but turned and ran so fast<br> After the prize that should her bliss fulfil,<br> That in her hand it lay ere it was still.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor did she rest, but turned about to win<br> Once more, an unblest woeful victory&#151; <A NAME="page_133"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 133</FONT></A><br> And yet&#151;and yet&#151;why does her breath begin<br> To fail her, and her feet drag heavily?<br> Why fails she now to see if far or nigh<br> The goal is? why do her grey eyes grow dim?<br> Why do these tremors run through every limb?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She spreads her arms abroad some stay to find<br> Else must she fall, indeed, and findeth this,<br> A strong man's arms about her body twined.<br> Nor may she shudder now to feel his kiss,<br> So wrapped she is in new unbroken bliss:<br> Made happy that the foe the prize hath won.<br> She weeps glad tears for all her glory done.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>SHATTER the trumpet, hew adown the posts!<br> Upon the brazen altar break the sword,<br> And scatter incense to appease the ghosts<br> Of those who died here by their own award.<br> Bring forth the image of the mighty Lord,<br> And her who unseen o&#146;er the runners hung,<br> And did a deed for ever to be sung.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the gathered folk, make no delay,<br> Open King Sch&#156;neus' well-filled treasury,<br> Bring out the gifts long hid from light of day,<br> The golden bowls o&#146;erwrought with imagery, <A NAME="page_134"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 134</FONT></A><br> Gold chains, and unguents brought from over sea,<br> The saffron gown the old Ph&#156;nician brought,<br> Within the temple of the Goddess wrought.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O ye, O damsels, who shall never see<br> Her, that Love's servant bringeth now to you,<br> Returning from another victory,<br> In some cool bower do all that now is due!<br> Since she in token of her service new<br> Shall give to Venus offerings rich enow,<br> Her maiden zone, her arrows, and her bow. <A NAME="page_135"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 135</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>SO when his last word's echo died away,<br> The growing wind at end of that wild day<br> Alone they heard, for silence bound them all;<br> Yea, on their hearts a weight had seemed to fall,<br> As unto the scarce-hoped felicity<br> The tale drew round&#151;the end of life so nigh,<br> The aim so little, and the joy so vain&#151;<br> For as a child's unmeasured joy brings pain<br> Unto a grown man holding grief at bay,<br> So the old fervent story of that day<br> Brought pain half-sweet, to these: till now the fire<br> Upon the hearth sent up a flickering spire<br> Of ruddy flame, as fell the burned-through logs,<br> And, waked by sudden silence, grey old dogs,<br> The friends of this or that man, rose and fawned<br> On hands they knew; withal once more there dawned<br> The light of common day on those old hearts,<br> And all were ready now to play their parts,<br> And take what feeble joy might yet remain<br> In place of all they once had hoped to gain. <A NAME="page_136"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 136</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>NOW on the second day that these did meet<br> March was a-dying through soft days and sweet,<br> Too hopeful for the wild days yet to be;<br> But in the hall that ancient company,<br> Not lacking younger folk that day at least,<br> Softened by spring were gathered at the feast,<br> And as the time drew on, throughout the hall<br> A horn was sounded, giving note to all<br> That they at last the looked-for tale should hear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then spake a Wanderer, "O kind hosts and dear,<br> Hearken a little unto such a tale<br> As folk with us will tell in every vale<br> About the yule-tide fire, when the snow<br> Deep in the passes, letteth men to go<br> From place to place: now there few great folk be,<br> Although we upland men have memory<br> Of ills kings did us; yet as now indeed<br> Few have much wealth, few are in utter need.<br> Like the wise ants a kingless, happy folk<br> We long have been, not galled by any yoke,<br> But the white leaguer of the winter tide<br> Whereby all men at home are bound to bide.<br> &#151;Alas, my folly! how I talk of it,<br> As though from this place where to-day we sit<br> The way thereto was short&#151;Ah, would to God<br> Upon the snow-freed herbage now I trod!<br> But pardon, sirs; the time goes swiftly by,<br> Hearken a tale of conquering destiny.</p>
