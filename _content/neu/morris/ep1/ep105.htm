<p>SLAYER of the winter, art thou here again?<br> O welcome, thou that bring&#146;st the summer nigh!<br> The bitter wind makes not thy victory vain,<br> Nor will we mock thee for thy faint blue sky.<br> Welcome, O March! whose kindly days and dry<br> Make April ready for the throstle's song,<br> Thou first redresser of the winter's wrong!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, welcome March! and though I die ere June,<br> Yet for the hope of life I give thee praise,<br> Striving to swell the burden of the tune<br> That even now I hear thy brown birds raise,<br> Unmindful of the past or coming days;<br> Who sing: 'O joy! a new year is begun:<br> What happiness to look upon the sun!'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, what begetteth all this storm of bliss<br> But Death himself, who crying solemnly,<br> E&#146;en from the heart of sweet Forgetfulness,<br> Bids us 'Rejoice, lest pleasureless ye die.<br> Within a little time must ye go by.<br> Stretch forth your open hands, and while ye live<br> Take all the gifts that Death and Life may give.' <A NAME="page_104"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 104</FONT></A></p>  
<p>BEHOLD once more within a quiet land<br> The remnant of that once aspiring band,<br> With all hopes fallen away, but such as light<br> The sons of men to that unfailing night,<br> That death they needs must look on face to face.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time passed, and ever fell the days apace<br> From off the new-strung chaplet of their life;<br> Yet though the time with no bright deeds was rife,<br> Though no fulfilled desire now made them glad,<br> They were not quite unhappy, rest they had,<br> And with their hope their fear had passed away;<br> New things and strange they saw from day to day;<br> Honoured they were, and had no lack of things<br> For which men crouch before the feet of kings,<br> And, stripped of honour, yet may fail to have.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore their latter journey to the grave<br> Was like those days of later autumn-tide,<br> When he who in some town may chance to bide<br> Opens the window for the balmy air,<br> And seeing the golden hazy sky so fair,<br> And from some city garden hearing still<br> The wheeling rooks the air with music fill,<br> Sweet hopeful music, thinketh, Is this spring,<br> Surely the year can scarce be perishing?<br> But then he leaves the clamour of the town,<br> And sees the withered scanty leaves fall down, <A NAME="page_105"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 105</FONT></A><br> The half-ploughed field, the flowerless garden-plot,<br> The dark full stream by summer long forgot,<br> The tangled hedges where, relaxed and dead,<br> The twining plants their withered berries shed,<br> And feels therewith the treachery of the sun,<br> And knows the pleasant time is well-nigh done.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such St. Luke's short summer lived these men,<br> Nearing the goal of threescore years and ten;<br> The elders of the town their comrades were,<br> And they to them were waxen now as dear<br> As ancient men to ancient men can be;<br> Grave matters of belief and polity<br> They spoke of oft, but not alone of these;<br> For in their times of idleness and ease<br> They told of poets&#146; vain imaginings,<br> And memories vague of half-forgotten things,<br> Not true or false, but sweet to think upon.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For nigh the time when first that land they won,<br> When new-born March made fresh the hopeful air,<br> The wanderers sat within a chamber fair,<br> Guests of that city's rulers, when the day<br> Far from the sunny noon had fallen away;<br> The sky grew dark, and on the window-pane<br> They heard the beating of the sudden rain.<br> Then, all being satisfied with plenteous feast,<br> There spoke an ancient man, the land's chief priest,<br> Who said, "Dear guests, the year begins to-day,<br> And fain are we, before it pass away, <A NAME="page_106"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 106</FONT></A><br> To hear some tales of that now altered world,<br> Wherefrom our fathers in old time were hurled<br> By the hard hands of fate and destiny.<br> Nor would ye hear perchance unwillingly<br> How we have dealt with stories of the land<br> Wherein the tombs of our forefathers stand:<br> Wherefore henceforth two solemn feasts shall be<br> In every month, at which some history<br> Shall crown our joyance; and this day, indeed,<br> I have a story ready for our need,<br> If ye will hear it, though perchance it is<br> That many things therein are writ amiss,<br> This part forgotten, that part grown too great,<br> For these things, too, are in the hands of fate."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cried aloud for joy to hear him speak,<br> And as again the sinking sun did break<br> Through the dark clouds and blazed adown the hall,<br> His clear thin voice upon their ears did fall,<br> Telling a tale of times long passed away,<br> When men might cross a kingdom in a day,<br> And kings remembered they should one day die,<br> And all folk dwelt in great simplicity.</p>
