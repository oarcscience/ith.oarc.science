<p><A NAME="page_617"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 617</FONT></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">OGIER THE DANE.</h3>  <h4 align="center">ARGUMENT.</h4>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">WHEN Ogier was born, six fay ladies came to the cradle where he lay, and gave him various gifts, as to be brave and happy and the like; but the sixth gave him to he her love when he should have lived long in the world: so Ogier grew up and became the greatest of knights, and at last, after many years, fell into the hands of that fay, and with her, as the story tells, he lives now, though he returned once to the world, as is shown in the process of this tale.</FONT></p>  
<p>WITHIN some Danish city by the sea,<br> Whose name, changed now, is all unknown to me,<br> Great mourning was there one fair summer eve,<br> Because the angels, bidden to receive<br> The fair Queen's lovely soul in Paradise,<br> Had done their bidding, and in royal guise<br> Her helpless body, once the prize of love,<br> Unable now for fear or hope to move,<br> Lay underneath the golden canopy;<br> And bowed down by unkingly misery<br> The King sat by it, and not far away, <A NAME="page_618"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 618</FONT></A><br> Within the chamber a fair man-child lay,<br> His mother's bane, the king that was to be,<br> Not witting yet of any royalty,<br> Harmless and loved, although so new to life.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm the June evening was, no sign of strife<br> The clear sky showed, no storm grew round the sun,<br> Unhappy that his day of bliss was done;<br> Dumb was the sea, and if the beech-wood stirred,<br> &#146;Twas with the nestling of the grey-winged bird<br> Midst its thick leaves; and though the nightingale<br> Her ancient, hapless sorrow must bewail,<br> No more of woe there seemed in her song<br> Than such as doth to lovers&#146; words belong,<br> Because their love is still unsatisfied.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to the King, on that sweet eventide,<br> No earth there seemed, no heaven when earth was gone;<br> No help, no God! but lonely pain alone;<br> And he, midst unreal shadows, seemed to sit<br> Himself the very heart and soul of it.<br> But round the cradle of the new-born child<br> The nurses now the weary time beguiled<br> With stories of the just departed Queen;<br> And how, amid the heathen folk first seen,<br> She had been won to love and godliness;<br> And as they spoke, e&#146;en midst his dull distress,<br> An eager whisper now and then would smite<br> Upon the King's ear, of some past delight,<br> Some once familiar name, and he would raise <A NAME="page_619"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 619</FONT></A><br> His weary head, and on the speaker gaze<br> Like one about to speak, but soon again<br> Would drop his head and be alone with pain,<br> Nor think of these; who, silent in their turn,<br> Would sit and watch the waxen tapers burn<br> Amidst the dusk of the quick-gathering night,<br> Until beneath the high stars&#146; glimmering light,<br> The fresh earth lay in colourless repose.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So past the night, and now and then one rose<br> From out her place to do what might avail<br> To still the new-born infant's fretful wail;<br> Or through the softly-opened door there came<br> Some nurse new waked, who, whispering low the name<br> Of her whose turn was come, would take her place;<br> Then toward the King would turn about her face<br> And to her fellows whisper of the day,<br> And tell again of her just past away.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So passed the night, the moon arose and grew,<br> From off the sea a little west-wind blew,<br> Rustling the garden-leaves like sudden rain;<br> And ere the moon had &#146;gun to fall again<br> The wind grew cold, a change was in the sky,<br> And in deep silence did the dawn draw nigh:<br> Then from her place a nurse arose to light<br> Fresh hallowed lights, for, dying with the night,<br> The tapers round about the dead Queen were;<br> But the King raised his head and &#146;gan to stare<br> Upon her, as her sweeping gown did glide <A NAME="page_620"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 620</FONT></A><br> About the floor, that in the stillness cried<br> Beneath her careful feet; and now as she<br> Had lit the second candle carefully,<br> And on its silver spike a second one<br> Was setting, through her body did there run<br> A sudden tremor, and the hand was stayed<br> That on the dainty painted wax was laid;<br> Her eyelids fell down and she seemed to sleep,<br> And o&#146;er the staring King began to creep<br> Sweet slumber too; the bitter lines of woe<br> That drew his weary face did softer grow,<br> His eyelids dropped, his arms fell to his side;<br> And moveless in their places did abide<br> The nursing women, held by some strong spell,<br> E&#146;en as they were, and utter silence fell<br> Upon the mournful, glimmering chamber fair.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now light footsteps coming up the stair,<br> Smote on the deadly stillness, and the sound<br> Of silken dresses trailing o&#146;er the ground;<br> And heavenly odours through the chamber passed,<br> Unlike the scents that rose and lily cast<br> Upon the freshness of the dying night;<br> Then nigher drew the sound of footsteps light<br> Until the door swung open noiselessly&#151;<br> A mass of sunlit flowers there seemed to be<br> Within the doorway, and but pale and wan<br> The flame showed now that serveth mortal man,<br> As one by one six seeming ladies passed<br> Into the room, and o&#146;er its sorrow cast <A NAME="page_621"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 621</FONT></A><br> That thoughtless sense of joy bewildering,<br> That kisses youthful hearts amidst of spring;<br> Crowned were they, in such glorious raiment clad,<br> As yet no merchant of the world has had<br> Within his coffers; yet those crowns seemed fair<br> Only because they kissed their odorous hair,<br> And all that flowery raiment was but blessed<br> By those fair bodies that its splendour pressed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to the cradle from that glorious band,<br> A woman passed, and laid a tender hand<br> Upon the babe, and gently drew aside<br> The swathings soft that did his body hide;<br> And, seeing him so fair and great, she smiled,<br> And stooped, and kissed him, saying, "O noble child,<br> Have thou a gift from Gloriande this day;<br> For to the time when life shall pass away<br> From this dear heart, no fear of death or shame,<br> No weariness of good shall foul thy name."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So saying, to her sisters she returned;<br> And one came forth, upon whose brow there burned<br> A crown of rubies, and whose heaving breast<br> With happy rings a golden hauberk pressed;<br> She took the babe, and somewhat frowning said,<br> "This gift I give, that till thy limbs are laid<br> At rest for ever, to thine honoured life<br> There never shall be lacking war and strife,<br> That thou a long-enduring name mayst win,<br> And by thy deeds, good pardon for thy sin."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that another, who, unseen, meanwhile <A NAME="page_622"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 622</FONT></A><br> Had drawn anigh, said with a joyous smile,<br> "And this forgotten gift to thee I give,<br> That while amidst the turmoil thou dost live,<br> Still shalt thou win the game, and unto thee<br> Defeat and shame but idle words shall be."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then back they turned, and therewithal, the fourth<br> Said, "Take this gift for what it may be worth,<br> For that is mine to give; lo, thou shalt be<br> Gentle of speech, and in all courtesy<br> The first of men: a little gift this is,<br> After these promises of fame and bliss."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then toward the babe the fifth fair woman went;<br> Grey-eyed she was, and simple, with eyes bent<br> Down on the floor, parted her red lips were,<br> And o&#146;er her sweet face marvellously fair<br> Oft would the colour spread full suddenly;<br> Clad in a dainty gown and thin was she,<br> For some green summer of the fay-land dight,<br> Tripping she went, and laid her fingers light<br> Upon the child, and said, "O little one,<br> As long as thou shalt look upon the sun<br> Shall women long for thee; take heed to this<br> And give them what thou canst of love and bliss."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, blushing for her words, therefrom she past,<br> And by the cradle stood the sixth and last,<br> The fairest of them all; awhile she gazed<br> Down on the child, and then her hand she raised,<br> And made the one side of her bosom bare;<br> "Ogier," she said, "if this be foul or fair <A NAME="page_623"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 623</FONT></A><br> Thou know&#146;st not now, but when thine earthly life<br> Is drunk out to the dregs, and war and strife<br> Have yielded thee whatever joy they may,<br> Thine head upon this bosom shalt thou lay;<br> And then, despite of knowledge or of God,<br> Will we be glad upon the flowery sod<br> Within the happy country where I dwell:<br> Ogier, my love that is to be, farewell!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned, and even as they came they passed<br> From out the place, and reached the gate at last<br> That oped before their feet, and speedily<br> They gained the edges of the murmuring sea,<br> And as they stood in silence, gazing there<br> Out to the west, they vanished into air,<br> I know not how, nor whereto they returned.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But mixed with twilight in the chamber burned<br> The flickering candles, and those dreary folk,<br> Unlike to sleepers, from their trance awoke,<br> But nought of what had happed meanwhile they knew;<br> Through the half-opened casements now there blew<br> A sweet fresh air, that of the flowers and sea<br> Mingled together, smelt deliciously,<br> And from the unseen sun the spreading light<br> Began to make the fair June blossoms bright,<br> And midst their weary woe uprose the sun,<br> And thus has Ogier's noble life begun.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_624"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 624</FONT></A></p>  
<p>HOPE is our life, when first our life grows clear;<br> Hope and delight, scarce crossed by lines of fear,<br> Yet the day comes when fain we would not hope,<br> But forasmuch as we with life must cope,<br> Struggling with this and that, and who knows why<br> Hope will not give us up to certainty,<br> But still must bide with us: and with this man,<br> Whose life amid such promises began<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great things she wrought; but now the time has come<br> When he no more on earth may have his home.<br> Great things he suffered, great delights he had,<br> Unto great kings he gave good deeds for bad;<br> He ruled o&#146;er kingdoms where his name no more<br> Is had in memory, and on many a shore<br> He left his sweat and blood to win a name<br> Passing the bounds of earthly creatures&#146; fame.<br> A love he won and lost, a well-loved son<br> Whose little day of promise soon was done:<br> A tender wife he had, that he must leave<br> Before his heart her love could well receive;<br> Those promised gifts, that on his careless head<br> In those first hours of his fair life were shed<br> He took unwitting, and unwitting spent,<br> Nor gave himself to grief and discontent<br> Because he saw the end a-drawing nigh. <A NAME="page_625"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 625</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is he now? in what land must he die,<br> To leave an empty name to us on earth?<br> A tale half true, to cast across our mirth<br> Some pensive thoughts of life that might have been,<br> Where is he now, that all this life has seen?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold, another eve I bid you see<br> Than that calm eve of his nativity;<br> The sun is setting in the west, the sky<br> Is clear and hard, and no clouds come anigh<br> The golden orb, but further off they lie,<br> Steel-grey and black with edges red as blood,<br> And underneath them is the weltering flood<br> Of some huge sea, whose tumbling hills, as they<br> Turn restless sides about, are black or grey,<br> Or green, or glittering with the golden flame;<br> The wind has fallen now, but still the same<br> The mighty army moves, as if to drown<br> This lone, bare rock, whose shear scarped sides of brown<br> Cast off the weight of waves in clouds of spray.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! what ships upon an evil day<br> Bent over to the wind in this ill sea?<br> What navy, whose rent bones lie wretchedly<br> Beneath these cliffs? a mighty one it was,<br> A fearful storm to bring such things to pass.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the loadstone rock; no armament<br> Of warring nations, in their madness bent<br> Their course this way; no merchant wittingly <A NAME="page_626"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 626</FONT></A><br> Has steered his keel unto this luckless sea;<br> Upon no shipman's card its name is writ,<br> Though worn-out mariners will speak of it<br> Within the ingle on the winter's night,<br> When all within is warm and safe and bright,<br> And the wind howls without: but &#146;gainst their will<br> Are some folk driven here, and then all skill<br> Against this evil rock is vain and nought,<br> And unto death the shipmen soon are brought;<br> For then the keel, as by a giant's hand,<br> Is drawn unto that mockery of a land,<br> And presently unto its sides doth cleave;<br> When if they &#146;scape swift death, yet none may leave<br> The narrow limits of that barren isle,<br> And thus are slain by famine in a while<br> Mocked, as they say, by night with images<br> Of noble castles among gloves of trees,<br> By day with sounds of merry minstrelsy.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun sinks now below this hopeless sea,<br> The clouds are gone, and all the sky is bright;<br> The moon is rising o&#146;er the growing night,<br> And by its light may ye behold the bones<br> Of generations of these luckless ones<br> Scattered about the rock; but nigh the sea<br> Sits one alive, who uncomplainingly<br> Awaits his death. White-haired is he and old,<br> Arrayed in royal raiment, bright with gold,<br> But tarnished with the waves and rough salt air; <A NAME="page_627"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 627</FONT></A><br> Huge is he, of a noble face and fair,<br> As for an ancient man, though toil and eld<br> Furrow the cheeks that ladies once beheld<br> With melting hearts&#151;Nay, listen, for he speaks!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God, thou hast made me strong! nigh seven weeks<br> Have passed since from the wreck we haled our store,<br> And five long days well told, have now passed o&#146;er<br> Since my last fellow died, with my last bread<br> Between his teeth, and yet I am not dead.<br> Yea, but for this I had been strong enow<br> In some last bloody field my sword to show.<br> What matter? soon will all be past and done,<br> Where&#146;er I died I must have died alone:<br> Yet, Caraheu, a good death had it been<br> Dying, thy face above me to have seen,<br> And heard my banner flapping in the wind,<br> Then, though my memory had not left thy mind,<br> Yet hope and fear would not have vexed thee more<br> When thou hadst known that everything was o&#146;er;<br> But now thou waitest, still expecting me,<br> Whose sail shall never speck thy bright blue sea.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And thou, Clarice, the merchants thou mayst call,<br> To tell thee tales within thy pictured hall,<br> But never shall they tell true tales of me:<br> Whatever sails the Kentish hills may see<br> Swept by the flood-tide toward thy well-walled town,<br> No more on my sails shall they look adown.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get thee another leader, Charlemaine,<br> For thou shalt look to see my shield in vain, <A NAME="page_628"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 628</FONT></A><br> When in the fair fields of the Frankish land,<br> Thick as the corn they tread, the heathen stand.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What matter? ye shall learn to live your lives;<br> Husbands and children, other friends and wives,<br> Shall wipe the tablets of your memory clean,<br> And all shall be as I had never been.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And now, O God, am I alone with Thee;<br> A little thing indeed it seems to be<br> To give this life up, since it needs must go<br> Some time or other; now at last I know<br> How foolishly men play upon the earth,<br> When unto them a year of life seems worth<br> Honour and friends, and these vague hopes and sweet<br> That like real things my dying heart do greet,<br> Unreal while living on the earth I trod,<br> And but myself I knew no other god.<br> Behold, I thank Thee that Thou sweet&#146;nest thus,<br> This end, that I had thought most piteous,<br> If of another I had heard it told."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What man is this, who weak and worn and old,<br> Gives up his life within that dreadful isle,<br> And on the fearful coming death can smile?<br> Alas! this man so battered and outworn,<br> Is none but he, who, on that summer morn,<br> Received such promises of glorious life:<br> Ogier the Dane this is, to whom all strife<br> Was but as wine to stir awhile the blood, <A NAME="page_629"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 629</FONT></A><br> To whom all life, however hard, was good<br> This is the man, unmatched of heart and limb,<br> Ogier the Dane, whose sight has waxed not dim<br> For all the years that he on earth has dwelt;<br> Ogier the Dane, that never fear has felt,<br> Since he knew good from ill; Ogier the Dane,<br> The heathen's dread, the evil-doer's bane.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>BRIGHT had the moon grown as his words were done,<br> And no more was there memory of the sun<br> Within the west, and he grew drowsy now,<br> And somewhat smoother was his wrinkled brow<br> As thought died out beneath the hand of sleep,<br> And o&#146;er his soul forgetfulness did creep,<br> Hiding the image of swift-coming death;<br> Until as peacefully he drew his breath<br> As on that day, past for a hundred years,<br> When, midst the nurse's quickly-falling tears,<br> He fell asleep to his first lullaby.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night changed as he slept, white clouds and high<br> Began about the lonely moon to close;<br> And from the dark west a new wind arose,<br> And with the sound of heavy-falling waves<br> Mingled its pipe about the loadstone caves; <A NAME="page_630"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 630</FONT></A><br> But when the twinkling stars were hid away,<br> And a faint light and broad, like dawn of day,<br> The moon upon that dreary country shed,<br> Ogier awoke, and lifting up his head<br> And smiling, muttered, "Nay, no more again;<br> Rather some pleasure new, some other pain,<br> Unthought of both, some other form of strife;"<br> For he had waked from dreams of his old life,<br> And through St. Omer's archer-guarded gate<br> Once more had seemed to pass, and saw the state<br> Of that triumphant king; and still, though all<br> Seemed changed, and folk by other names did call<br> Faces he knew of old, yet none the less<br> He seemed the same, and, midst that mightiness,<br> Felt his own power, and grew the more athirst<br> For coming glory, as of old, when first<br> He stood before the face of Charlemaine,<br> A helpless hostage with all life to gain.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, awake, his worn face once more sank<br> Between his hands, and, murmuring not, he drank<br> The draught of death that must that thirst allay.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while he sat and waited for the day<br> A sudden light across the bare rock streamed,<br> Which at the first he noted not, but deemed<br> The moon her fleecy veil had broken through;<br> But ruddier indeed this new light grew<br> Than were the moon's grey beams, and, therewithal,<br> Soft far-off music on his ears did fall; <A NAME="page_631"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 631</FONT></A><br> Yet moved he not, but murmured, "This is death,<br> An easy thing like this to yield my breath,<br> Awake, yet dreaming, with no sounds of fear,<br> No dreadful sights to tell me it is near;<br> Yea, God, I thank thee!" but with that last word<br> It seemed to him that he his own name heard<br> Whispered, as though the wind had borne it past;<br> With that he gat unto his feet at last,<br> But still awhile he stood, with sunken head,<br> And in a low and trembling voice he said,<br> "Lord, I am ready, whither shall I go?<br> I pray thee unto me some token show."<br> And, as he said this, round about he turned,<br> And in the east beheld a light that burned<br> As bright as day; then, though his flesh might fear<br> The coming change that he believed so near,<br> Yet did his soul rejoice, for now he thought<br> Unto the very heaven to be brought:<br> And though he felt alive, deemed it might be<br> That he in sleep had died full easily.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then toward that light did he begin to go,<br> And still those strains he heard, far off and low,<br> That grew no louder; still that bright light streamed<br> Over the rocks, yet nothing brighter seemed,<br> But like the light of some unseen bright flame<br> Shone round about, until at last he came<br> Unto the dreary islet's other shore,<br> And then the minstrelsy he heard no more,<br> And softer seemed the strange light unto him; <A NAME="page_632"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 632</FONT></A><br> But yet or ever it had grown quite dim,<br> Beneath its waning light could he behold<br> A mighty palace set about with gold,<br> Above green meads and groves of summer trees<br> Far-off across the welter of the seas;<br> But, as he gazed, it faded from his sight,<br> And the grey hidden moon's diffused soft light,<br> Which soothly was but darkness to him now,<br> His sea-girt island prison did but show.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But o&#146;er the sea he still gazed wistfully,<br> And said, "Alas! and when will this go by<br> And leave my soul in peace? must I still dream<br> Of life that once so dear a thing did seem,<br> That, when I wake, death may the bitterer be?<br> Here will I sit until he come to me,<br> And hide mine eyes and think upon my sin,<br> That so a little calm I yet may win<br> Before I stand within the awful place."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then down he sat and covered up his face,<br> Yet therewithal his trouble could not hide,<br> Nor waiting thus for death could he abide,<br> For, though he knew it not, the yearning pain<br> Of hope of life had touched his soul again&#151;<br> If he could live awhile, if he could live!<br> The mighty being, who once was wont to give<br> The gift of life to many a trembling man;<br> Who did his own will since his life began;<br> Who feared not aught, but strong and great and free<br> Still cast aside the thought of what might be; <A NAME="page_633"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 633</FONT></A><br> Must all this then be lost, and with no will,<br> Powerless and blind, must he some fate fulfil,<br> Nor know what he is doing any more?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon he arose and paced along the shore,<br> And gazed out seaward for the blessed light;<br> But nought he saw except the old sad sight,<br> The ceaseless tumbling of the billows grey,<br> The white upspringing of the spurts of spray<br> Amidst that mass of timbers, the rent bones<br> Of the sea-houses of the hapless ones<br> Once cast like him upon this deadly isle.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped his pacing in a little while,<br> And clenched his mighty hands, and set his teeth,<br> And gazing at the ruin underneath,<br> He swung from off the bare cliff's jagged brow,<br> And on some slippery ledge he wavered now,<br> Without a hand-hold, and now stoutly clung<br> With hands alone, and o&#146;er the welter hung,<br> Not caring aught if thus his life should end;<br> But safely midst all this did he descend<br> The dreadful cliff, and since no beach was there,<br> But from the depths the rock rose stark and bare,<br> Nor crumbled aught beneath the hammering sea,<br> Upon the wrecks he stood unsteadily.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, amid the clamour of the waves,<br> And washing to-and-fro of beams and staves,<br> Dizzy with hunger, dreamy with distress, <A NAME="page_634"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 634</FONT></A><br> And all those days of fear and loneliness,<br> The ocean's tumult seemed the battle's roar,<br> His heart grew hot, as when in days of yore<br> He heard the cymbals clash amid the crowd<br> Of dusky faces; now he shouted loud,<br> And from crushed beam to beam began to leap,<br> And yet his footing somehow did he keep<br> Amidst their tossing, and indeed the sea<br> Was somewhat sunk upon the island's lee.<br> So quickly on from wreck to wreck he passed,<br> And reached the outer line of wrecks at last,<br> And there a moment stood unsteadily,<br> Amid the drift of spray that hurried by,<br> And drew Courtain his sword from out its sheath,<br> And poised himself to meet the coming death,<br> Still looking out to sea; but as he gazed,<br> And once or twice his doubtful feet he raised<br> To take the final plunge, that heavenly strain<br> Over the washing waves he heard again,<br> And from the dimness something bright he saw<br> Across the waste of waters towards him draw;<br> And hidden now, now raised aloft, at last<br> Unto his very feet a boat was cast,<br> Gilded inside and out, and well arrayed<br> With cushions soft; far fitter to have weighed<br> From some sweet garden on the shallow Seine,<br> Or in a reach of green Thames to have lain,<br> Than struggle with that huge confus&egrave;d sea;<br> But Ogier gazed upon it doubtfully <A NAME="page_635"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 635</FONT></A><br> One moment, and then, sheathing Courtain, said,<br> "What tales are these about the newly dead<br> The heathen told? what matter, let all pass;<br> This moment as one dead indeed I was,<br> And this must be what I have got to do,<br> I yet perchance may light on something new<br> Before I die; though yet perchance this keel<br> Unto the wondrous mass of charmed steel<br> Is drawn as others." With that word he leapt<br> Into the boat, and o&#146;er the cushions crept<br> From stem to stern, but found no rudder there,<br> Nor any oars, nor were the cushions fair<br> Made wet by any dashing of the sea.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now while he pondered how these things could be,<br> The boat began to move therefrom at last,<br> But over him a drowsiness was cast,<br> And as o&#146;er tumbling hills the skiff did pass,<br> He clean forgot his death and where he was.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last he woke up to a sunny day,<br> And, looking round, saw that his shallop lay<br> Moored at the edge of some fair tideless sea<br> Unto an overhanging thick-leaved tree,<br> Where in the green waves did the low bank dip<br> Its fresh and green grass-covered daisied lip;<br> But Ogier looking thence no more could see<br> That sad abode of death and misery,<br> Nor aught but wide and empty ocean, grey<br> With gathering haze, for now it neared midday; <A NAME="page_636"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 636</FONT></A><br> Then from the golden cushions did he rise,<br> And wondering still if this were Paradise<br> He stepped ashore, but drew Courtain his sword<br> And muttered therewithal a holy word.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair was the place, as though amidst of May,<br> Nor did the brown birds fear the sunny day,<br> For with their quivering song the air was sweet;<br> Thick grew the field-flowers underneath his feet,<br> And on his head the blossoms down did rain,<br> Yet mid these fair things slowly and with pain<br> He &#146;gan to go, yea, even when his foot<br> First touched the flowery sod, to his heart's root<br> A coldness seemed to strike, and now each limb<br> Was growing stiff, his eyes waxed bleared and dim,<br> And all his stored-up memory &#146;gan to fail,<br> Nor yet would his once mighty heart avail<br> For lamentations o&#146;er his changed lot;<br> Yet urged by some desire, he knew not what,<br> Along a little path &#146;twixt hedges sweet,<br> Drawn sword in hand, he dragged his faltering feet,<br> For what then seemed to him a weary way,<br> Whereon his steps he needs must often stay<br> And lean upon the mighty well-worn sword<br> That in those hands, grown old, for king or lord<br> Had small respect in glorious days long past.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still he crept along, and at the last<br> Came to a gilded wicket, and through this<br> Entered a garden fit for utmost bliss, <A NAME="page_637"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 637</FONT></A><br> If that might last which needs must soon go by:<br> There &#146;gainst a tree he leaned, and with a sigh<br> He said, "O God, a sinner I have been,<br> And good it is that I these things have seen<br> Before I meet what thou hast set apart<br> To cleanse the earthly folly from my heart;<br> But who within this garden now can dwell<br> Wherein guilt first upon the world befell?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little further yet he staggered on,<br> Till to a fountain-side at last he won,<br> O&#146;er which two white-thorns their sweet blossoms shed,<br> There he sank down, and laid his weary head<br> Beside the mossy roots, and in a while<br> He slept, and dreamed himself within the isle;<br> That splashing fount the weary sea did seem,<br> And in his dream the fair place but a dream;<br> But when again to feebleness he woke<br> Upon his ears that heavenly music broke,<br> Not faint or far as in the isle it was,<br> But e&#146;en as though the minstrels now did pass<br> Anigh his resting-place; then fallen in doubt,<br> E&#146;en as he might, he rose and gazed about,<br> Leaning against the hawthorn stem with pain;<br> And yet his straining gaze was but in vain,<br> Death stole so fast upon him, and no more<br> Could he behold the blossoms as before,<br> No more the trees seemed rooted to the ground,<br> A heavy mist seemed gathering all around,<br> And in its heart some bright thing seemed to be, <A NAME="page_638"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 638</FONT></A><br> And round his head there breathed deliciously<br> Sweet odours, and that music never ceased.<br> But as the weight of Death's strong hand increased<br> Again he sank adown, and Courtain's noise<br> Within the scabbard seemed a farewell voice<br> Sent from the world he loved so well of old,<br> And all his life was as a story told,<br> And as he thought thereof he &#146;gan to smile<br> E&#146;en as a child asleep, but in a while<br> It was as though he slept, and sleeping dreamed,<br> For in his half-closed eyes a glory gleamed,<br> As though from some sweet face and golden hair,<br> And on his breast were laid soft hands and fair,<br> And a sweet voice was ringing in his ears,<br> Broken as if with flow of joyous tears;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ogier, sweet friend, hast thou not tarried long?<br> Alas! thine hundred years of strife and wrong!"<br> Then he found voice to say, "Alas! dear Lord,<br> Too long, too long; and yet one little word<br> Right many a year agone had brought me here."<br> Then to his face that face was drawn anear,<br> He felt his head raised up and gently laid<br> On some kind knee, again the sweet voice said,<br> "Nay, Ogier, nay, not yet, not yet, dear friend!<br> Who knoweth when our linked life shall end,<br> Since thou art come unto mine arms at last,<br> And all the turmoil of the world is past?<br> Why do I linger ere I see thy face<br> As I desired it in that mourning place <A NAME="page_639"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 639</FONT></A><br> So many years ago&#151;so many years,<br> Thou knewest not thy love and all her fears?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas!" he said, "what mockery is this<br> That thou wilt speak to me of earthly bliss?<br> No longer can I think upon the earth,<br> Have I not done with all its grief and mirth?<br> Yes, I was Ogier once, but if my love<br> Should come once more my dying heart to move,<br> Then must she come from &#146;neath the milk-white walls<br> Whereon to-day the hawthorn blossom falls<br> Outside St. Omer's&#151;art thou she? her name<br> I could remember once &#146;mid death and fame<br> GIs clean forgotten now; but yesterday,<br> Meseems, our son, upon her bosom lay:<br> Baldwin the fair&#151;what hast thou done with him<br> Since Charlot slew him? Ah, mine eyes wax dim;<br> Woman, forbear! wilt thou not let me die?<br> Did I forget thee in the days gone by?<br> Then let me die, that we may meet again!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to move from her, but all in vain,<br> For life had well-nigh left him, but withal<br> He felt a kiss upon his forehead fall,<br> And could not speak; he felt slim fingers fair<br> Move to his mighty sword-worn hand, and there,<br> Set on some ring, and still he could not speak,<br> And once more sleep weighed down his eyelids weak.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_640"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 640</FONT></A></p>  
<p>BUT, ah! what land was this he woke unto?<br> What joy was this that filled his heart anew?<br> Had he then gained the very Paradise?<br> Trembling, he durst not at the first arise,<br> Although no more he felt the pain of eld,<br> Nor durst he raise his eyes that now beheld<br> Beside him the white flowers and blades of grass;<br> He durst not speak, lest he some monster was.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while he lay and hoped, that gentle voice<br> Once more he heard; "Yea, thou mayst well rejoice!<br> Thou livest still, my sweet, thou livest still,<br> Apart from every earthly fear and ill;<br> Wilt thou not love me, who have wrought thee this,<br> That I like thee may live in double bliss?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Ogier rose up, nowise like to one<br> Whose span of earthly life is nigh outrun,<br> But as he might have risen in old days<br> To see the spears cleave the fresh morning haze;<br> But, looking round, he saw no change there was<br> In the fair place wherethrough he first did pass,<br> Though all, grown clear and joyous to his eyes,<br> Now looked no worse than very Paradise;<br> Behind him were the thorns, the fountain fair<br> Still sent its glittering stream forth into air,<br> And by its basin a fair woman stood,<br> And as their eyes met his renew&egrave;d blood<br> Rushed to his face; with unused thoughts and sweet <A NAME="page_641"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 641</FONT></A><br> And hurrying hopes, his heart began to beat.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fairest of all creatures did she seem;<br> So fresh and delicate you well might deem<br> That scarce for eighteen summers had she blessed<br> The happy, longing world; yet, for the rest,<br> Within her glorious eyes such wisdom dwelt<br> A child before her had the wise man felt,<br> And with the pleasure of a thousand years<br> Her lips were fashioned to move joy or tears<br> Among the longing folk where she might dwell,<br> To give at last the kiss unspeakable.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such wise was she clad as folk may be,<br> Who, for no shame of their humanity,<br> For no sad changes of the imperfect year,<br> Rather for added beauty, raiment wear;<br> For, as the heat-foretelling grey-blue haze<br> Veils the green flowery morn of late May-days,<br> Her raiment veiled her; where the bands did meet<br> That bound the sandals to her dainty feet,<br> Gems gleamed; a fresh rose-wreath embraced her head,<br> And on her breast there lay a ruby red.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with a supplicating look she turned<br> To meet the flame that in his own eyes burned,<br> And held out both her white arms lovingly,<br> As though to greet him as he drew anigh.<br> Stammering he said, "Who art thou? how am I<br> So cured of all my evils suddenly,<br> That certainly I felt no mightier, when,<br> Amid the backward rush of beaten men, <A NAME="page_642"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 642</FONT></A><br> About me drooped the axe-torn Oriflamme?<br> Alas! I fear that in some dream I am."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ogier," she said, "draw near, perchance it is<br> That such a name God gives unto our bliss;<br> I know not, but if thou art such an one<br> As I must deem, all days beneath the sun<br> That thou hast had, shall be but dreams indeed<br> To those that I have given thee at thy need.<br> For many years ago beside the sea<br> When thou wert born, I plighted troth with thee:<br> Come near then, and make mirrors of mine eyes,<br> That thou mayst see what these my mysteries<br> Have wrought in thee; surely but thirty years,<br> Passed amidst joy, thy new-born body bears,<br> Nor while thou art with me, and on this shore<br> Art still full-fed of love, shalt thou seem more.<br> Nay, love, come nigher, and let me take thine hand,<br> The hope and fear of many a warring land,<br> And I will show thee wherein lies the spell,<br> Whereby this happy change upon thee fell."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a shy youth before some royal love,<br> Close up to that fair woman did he move,<br> And their hands met; yet to his changed voice<br> He dared not trust; nay, scarcely could rejoice<br> E&#146;en when her balmy breath he &#146;gan to feel,<br> And felt strange sweetness o&#146;er his spirit steal<br> As her light raiment, driven by the wind,<br> Swept round him, and, bewildered and half-blind, <A NAME="page_643"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 643</FONT></A><br> His lips the treasure of her lips did press,<br> And round him clung her perfect loveliness.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one sweet moment thus they stood, and then<br> She drew herself from out his arms again,<br> And panting, lovelier for her love, did stand<br> Apart awhile, then took her lover's hand,<br> And, in a trembling voice, made haste to say,&#151;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Ogier, when thou camest here to-day,<br> I feared indeed, that in my sport with fate,<br> I might have seen thee e&#146;en one day too late,<br> Before this ring thy finger should embrace;<br> Behold it, love, and thy keen eyes may trace<br> Faint figures wrought upon the ruddy gold;<br> My father dying gave it me, nor told<br> The manner of its making, but I know<br> That it can make thee e&#146;en as thou art now<br> Despite the laws of God&#151;shrink not from me<br> Because I give an impious gift to thee&#151;<br> Has not God made me also, who do this?<br> But I, who longed to share with thee my bliss,<br> Am of the fays, and live their changeless life,<br> And, like the gods of old, I see the strife<br> That moves the world, unmoved if so I will;<br> For we the fruit, that teaches good and ill,<br> Have never touched like you of Adam's race;<br> And while thou dwellest with me in this place<br> Thus shalt thou be&#151;ah, and thou deem&#146;st, indeed,<br> That thou shalt gain thereby no happy meed<br> Reft of the world's joys? nor canst understand <A NAME="page_644"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 644</FONT></A><br> How thou art come into a happy land?&#151;<br> Love, in thy world the priests of heaven still sing,<br> And tell thee of it many a joyous thing;<br> But thinkst thou, bearing the world's joy and pain,<br> Thou couldst live there? nay, nay, but born again<br> Thou wouldst be happy with the angels&#146; bliss;<br> And so with us no otherwise it is,<br> Nor hast thou cast thine old life quite away<br> Even as yet, though that shall be to-day.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But for the love and country thou hast won,<br> Know thou, that thou art come to Avallon,<br> That is both thine and mine; and as for me,<br> Morgan le Fay men call me commonly<br> Within the world, but fairer names than this<br> I have for thee and me, &#146;twixt kiss and kiss."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, what was this? and was it all in vain,<br> That she had brought him here this life to gain?<br> For, ere her speech was done, like one turned blind<br> He watched the kisses of the wandering wind<br> Within her raiment, or as some one sees<br> The very best of well-wrought images<br> When he is blind with grief, did he behold<br> The wandering tresses of her locks of gold<br> Upon her shoulders; and no more he pressed<br> The hand that in his own hand lay at rest:<br> His eyes, grown dull with changing memories,<br> Could make no answer to her glorious eyes:<br> Cold waxed his heart, and weary and distraught, <A NAME="page_645"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 645</FONT></A><br> With many a cast-by, hateful, dreary thought,<br> Unfinished in the old days; and withal<br> He needs must think of what might chance to fall<br> In this life new-begun; and good and bad<br> Tormented him, because as yet he had<br> A worldly heart within his frame made new,<br> And to the deeds that he was wont to do<br> Did his desires still turn. But she a while<br> Stood gazing at him with a doubtful smile,<br> And let his hand fall down; but suddenly<br> Sounded sweet music from some close nearby,<br> And then she spoke again: "Come, love, with me,<br> That thou thy new life and delights mayst see."<br> And gently with that word she led him thence,<br> And though upon him now there fell a sense<br> Of dreamy and unreal bewilderment,<br> As hand in hand through that green place they went,<br> Yet therewithal a strain of tender love<br> A little yet his restless heart did move.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So through the whispering trees they came at last<br> To where a wondrous house a shadow cast<br> Across the flowers, and o&#146;er the daisied grass<br> Before it, crowds of lovely folk did pass,<br> Playing about in carelessness and mirth,<br> Unshadowed by the doubtful deeds of earth;<br> And from the midst a band of fair girls came,<br> With flowers and music, greeting him by name,.<br> And praising him; but ever like a dream <A NAME="page_646"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 646</FONT></A><br> He could not break, did all to Ogier seem,<br> And he his old world did the more desire,<br> For in his heart still burned unquenched the fire,<br> That through the world of old so bright did burn:<br> Yet was he fain that kindness to return,<br> And from the depth of his full heart he sighed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then toward the house the lovely Queen did guide<br> His listless steps, and seemed to take no thought<br> Of knitted brow or wandering eyes distraught,<br> But still with kind love lighting up her face<br> She led him through the door of that fair place,<br> While round about them did the damsels press;<br> And he was moved by all that loveliness<br> As one might be, who, lying half asleep<br> In the May morning, notes the light wind sweep<br> Over the tulip-beds: no more to him<br> Were gleaming eyes, red lips, and bodies slim,<br> Amidst that dream, although the first surprise<br> Of hurried love wherewith the Queen's sweet eyes<br> Had smitten him, still in his heart did stir.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so at last he came, led on by her<br> Into a hall wherein a fair throne was,<br> And hand in hand thereto the twain did pass;<br> And there she bade him sit, and when alone<br> He took his place upon the double throne,<br> She cast herself before him on her knees,<br> Embracing his, and greatly did increase<br> The shame and love that vexed his troubled heart: <A NAME="page_647"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 647</FONT></A><br> But now a line of girls the crowd did part,<br> Lovelier than all, and Ogier could behold<br> One in their midst who bore a crown of gold<br> Within her slender hands and delicate;<br> She, drawing nigh, beside the throne did wait<br> Until the Queen arose and took the crown,<br> Who then to Ogier's lips did stoop adown<br> And kissed him, and said, "Ogier, what were worth<br> Thy miserable days of strife on earth,<br> That on their ashes still thine eyes are turned?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as she spoke these words, his changed heart burned<br> With sudden memories, and thereto had he<br> Made answer, but she raised up suddenly<br> The crown she held and set it on his head,<br> "Ogier," she cried, "those troublous days are dead;<br> Thou wert dead with them also, but for me;<br> Turn unto her who wrought these things for thee!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as he felt her touch, a mighty wave<br> Of love swept o&#146;er his soul, as though the grave<br> Did really hold his body; from his seat<br> He rose to cast himself before her feet;<br> But she clung round him, and in close embrace<br> The twain were locked amidst that thronging place.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thenceforth new life indeed has Ogier won,<br> And in the happy land of Avallon<br> Quick glide the years o&#146;er his unchanging head;<br> There saw he many men the world thought dead,<A NAME="page_648"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 648</FONT></A><br> Living like him in sweet forgetfulness<br> Of all the troubles that did once oppress<br> Their vainly-struggling lives&#151;ah, how can I<br> Tell of their joy as though I had been nigh?<br> Suffice it that no fear of death they knew,<br> That there no talk there was of false or true,<br> Of right or wrong, for traitors came not there;<br> That everything was bright and soft and fair,<br> And yet they wearied not for any change,<br> Nor unto them did constancy seem strange.<br> Love knew they, but its pain they never had,<br> But with each other's joy were they made glad;<br> Nor were their lives wasted by hidden fire,<br> Nor knew they of the unfulfilled desire<br> That turns to ashes all the joys of earth,<br> Nor knew they yearning love amidst the dearth<br> Of kind and loving hearts to spend it on,<br> Nor dreamed of discontent when all was won;<br> Nor need they struggle after wealth and fame;<br> Still was the calm flow of their lives the same,<br> And yet, I say, they wearied not of it&#151;<br> So did the promised days by Ogier flit.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>THINK that a hundred years have now passed by,<br> Since ye beheld Ogier lie down to die<br> Beside the fountain; think that now ye are<br> In France, made dangerous with wasting war; <A NAME="page_649"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 649</FONT></A><br> In Paris, where about each guarded gate,<br> Gathered in knots, the anxious people wait,<br> And press around each new-come man to learn<br> If Harfleur now the pagan wasters burn,<br> Or if the Rouen folk can keep their chain,<br> Or Pont de l&#146;Arche unburnt still guards the Seine?<br> Or if 'tis true that Andelys succour wants?<br> That Vernon's folk are fleeing east to Mantes?<br> When will they come? or rather is it true<br> That a great band the Constable o&#146;erthrew<br> Upon the marshes of the lower Seine,<br> And that their long ships, turning back again,<br> Caught by the high-raised waters of the bore<br> Were driven here and there and cast ashore?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such questions did they ask, and, as fresh men<br> Came hurrying in, they asked them o&#146;er again,<br> And from scared folk, or fools, or ignorant,<br> Still got new lies, or tidings very scant.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now amidst these men at last came one,<br> A little ere the setting of the sun,<br> With two stout men behind him, armed right well,<br> Who ever as they rode on, sooth to tell,<br> With doubtful eyes upon their master stared,<br> Or looked about like troubled men and scared.<br> And he they served was noteworthy indeed;<br> Of ancient fashion were his arms and weed,<br> Rich past the wont of men in those sad times;<br> His face was bronzed, as though by burning climes, <A NAME="page_650"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 650</FONT></A><br> But lovely as the image of a god<br> Carved in the days before on earth Christ trod;<br> But solemn were his eyes, and grey as glass,<br> And like to ruddy gold his fine hair was;<br> A mighty man he was, and taller far<br> Than those who on that day must bear the war<br> The pagans waged: he by the warders stayed<br> Scarce looked on them, but straight their words obeyed<br> And showed his pass; then, asked about his name<br> And from what city of the world he came,<br> Said, that men called him now the Ancient Knight,<br> That he was come midst the king's men to fight<br> From St. Omer's; and as he spoke, he gazed<br> Down on the thronging street as one amazed,<br> And answered no more to the questioning<br> Of frightened folk of this or that sad thing;<br> But, ere he passed on, turned about at last<br> And on the wondering guard a strange look cast,<br> And said, "St. Mary! do such men as ye<br> Fight with the wasters from across the sea?<br> Then, certes, are ye lost, however good<br> Your hearts may be; not such were those who stood<br> Beside the Hammer-bearer years agone."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So said he, and as his fair armour shone<br> With beauty of a time long passed away,<br> So with the music of another day<br> His deep voice thrilled the awe-struck, listening folk.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet from the crowd a mocking voice outbroke, <A NAME="page_651"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 651</FONT></A><br> That cried, "Be merry, masters, fear ye nought,<br> Surely good succour to our side is brought;<br> For here is Charlemaine come off his tomb<br> To save his faithful city from its doom."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea," said another, "this is certain news,<br> Surely ye know how all the carvers use<br> To carve the dead man's image at the best,<br> That guards the place where he may lie at rest;<br> Wherefore this living image looks indeed,<br> Spite of his ancient tongue and marvellous weed,<br> To have but thirty summers."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the name<br> Of Charlemaine, he turned to whence there came<br> The mocking voice, and somewhat knit his brow,<br> And seemed as he would speak, but scarce knew how;<br> So with a half-sigh soon sank back again<br> Into his dream, and shook his well-wrought rein,<br> And silently went on upon his way.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this was Ogier: on what evil day<br> Has he then stumbled, that he needs must come,<br> Midst war and ravage, to the ancient home<br> Of his desires? did he grow weary then,<br> And wish to strive once more with foolish men<br> For worthless things? or is fair Avallon<br> Sunk in the sea, and all that glory gone?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, thus it happed&#151;One day she came to him<br> And said, "Ogier, thy name is waxen dim<br> Upon the world that thou rememberest not; <A NAME="page_652"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 652</FONT></A><br> The heathen men are thick on many a spot<br> Thine eyes have seen, and which I love therefore;<br> And God will give His wonted help no more.<br> Wilt thou, then, help? canst thou have any mind<br> To give thy banner once more to the wind?<br> Since greater glory thou shalt win for this<br> Than erst thou gatheredst ere thou cam&#146;st to bliss:<br> For men are dwindled both in heart and frame,<br> Nor holds the fair land any such a name<br> As thine, when thou wert living midst thy peers;<br> The world is worser for these hundred years."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his calm eyes there gleamed a little fire,<br> And in his voice was something of desire,<br> To see the land where he was used to be,<br> As now he answered: "Nay, choose thou for me,<br> Thou art the wisest; it is more than well<br> Within this peaceful place with thee to dwell:<br> Nor ill perchance in that old land to die,<br> If, dying, I keep not the memory<br> Of this fair life of ours." "Nay, nay," said she,<br> "As to thy dying, that shall never be,<br> Whiles that thou keepst my ring&#151;and now, behold,<br> I take from thee thy charmed crown of gold,<br> And thou wilt be the Ogier that thou wast<br> Ere on the loadstone rock thy ship was cast<br> Yet thou shalt have thy youthful body still,<br> And I will guard thy life from every ill."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So was it done, and Ogier, armed right well, <A NAME="page_653"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 653</FONT></A><br> Sleeping, was borne away by some strong spell,<br> And set upon the Flemish coast; and thence<br> Turned to St. Omer's, with a doubtful sense<br> Of being in some wild dream, the while he knew<br> That great delight forgotten was his due,<br> That all which there might hap was of small worth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on he went, and sometimes unto mirth<br> Did his attire move the country-folk,<br> But oftener when strange speeches from him broke<br> Concerning men and things for long years dead,<br> He filled the listeners with great awe and dread;<br> For in such wild times as these people were<br> Are men soon moved to wonder and to fear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now through the streets of Paris did he ride,<br> And at a certain hostel did abide<br> Throughout that night, and ere he went next day<br> He saw a book that on a table lay,<br> And opening it &#146;gan read in lazy mood:<br> But long before it in that place he stood,<br> Noting nought else; for it did chronicle<br> The deeds of men of old he knew right well,<br> When they were living in the flesh with him:<br> Yea, his own deeds he saw, grown strange and dim<br> Already, and true stories mixed with lies,<br> Until, with many thronging memories<br> Of those old days, his heart was so oppressed,<br> He &#146;gan to wish that he might lie at rest,<br> Forgetting all things: for indeed by this <A NAME="page_654"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 654</FONT></A><br> Little remembrance had he of the bliss<br> That wrapped his soul in peaceful Avallon.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his changed life he needs must carry on;<br> For ye shall know the Queen was gathering men<br> To send unto the good King, who as then<br> In Rouen lay, beset by many a band<br> Of those who carried terror through the land,<br> And still by messengers for help he prayed:<br> Therefore a mighty muster was being made,<br> Of weak and strong, and brave and timorous,<br> Before the Queen anigh her royal house.<br> So thither on this morn did Ogier turn,<br> Some certain news about the war to learn;<br> And when he came at last into the square,<br> And saw the ancient palace great and fair<br> Rise up before him as in other days,<br> And in the merry morn the bright sun's rays<br> Glittering on gathering helms and moving spears,<br> He &#146;gan to feel as in the long-past years,<br> And his heart stirred within him. Now the Queen<br> Came from within, right royally beseen,<br> And took her seat beneath a canopy,<br> With lords and captains of the war anigh;<br> And as she came a mighty shout arose,<br> And round about began the knights to close,<br> Their oath of fealty there to swear anew,<br> And learn what service they had got to do.<br> But so it was, that some their shouts must stay <A NAME="page_655"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 655</FONT></A><br> To gaze at Ogier as he took his way<br> Through the thronged place; and quickly too he gat<br> Unto the place whereas the Lady sat,<br> For men gave place unto him, fearing him:<br> For not alone was he most huge of limb,<br> And dangerous, but something in his face,<br> As his calm eyes looked o&#146;er the crowded place,<br> Struck men with awe; and in the ancient days,<br> When men might hope alive on gods to gaze,<br> They would have thought, 'the Gods yet love our town,<br> And from the heavens have sent a great one down.'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withal unto the throne he came so near,<br> That he the Queen's sweet measured voice could hear;<br> And swiftly now within him wrought the change<br> That first he felt amid those faces strange;<br> And his heart burned to taste the hurrying life<br> With such desires, such changing sweetness rife.<br> Ana yet, indeed, how should he live alone,<br> Who in the old past days such friends had known?<br> Then he began to think of Caraheu,<br> Of Bellicent the fair, and once more knew<br> The bitter pain of rent and ended love.<br> But while with hope and vain regret he strove,<br> He found none &#146;twixt him and the Queen's high-seat,<br> And, stepping forth, he knelt before her feet<br> And took her hand to swear, as was the way<br> Of doing fealty in that ancient day,<br> And raised his eyes to hers; as fair was she<br> As any woman of the world might be, <A NAME="page_656"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 656</FONT></A><br> Full-limbed and tall, dark-haired, from her deep eyes,<br> The snare of fools, the ruin of the wise,<br> Love looked unchecked; and now her dainty hand,<br> The well-knit holder of the golden wand,<br> Trembled in his, she cast her eyes adown,<br> And her sweet brow was knitted to a frown,<br> As he, the taker of such oaths of yore,<br> Now unto her all due obedience swore,<br> Yet gave himself no name; and now the Queen,<br> Awed by his voice as other folk had been,<br> Yet felt a trembling hope within her rise<br> Too sweet to think of, and with love's surprise<br> Her cheek grew pale; she said, "Thy style and name<br> Thou tellest not, nor what land of thy fame<br> Is glad; for, certes, some land must be glad,<br> That in its bounds her house thy mother had."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lady," he said, "from what far land I come<br> I well might tell thee, but another home.<br> Have I long dwelt in, and its name have I<br> Forgotten now, forgotten utterly<br> Who were my fellows, and what deeds they did;<br> Therefore, indeed, shall my first name be hid<br> And my first country; call me on this day<br> The Ancient Knight, and let me go my way."<br> He rose withal, for she her fingers fair<br> Had drawn aback, and on him &#146;gan to stare<br> As one afeard; for something terrible<br> Was in his speech, and that she knew right well,<br> Who &#146;gan to love him, and to fear that she, <A NAME="page_657"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 657</FONT></A><br> Shut out by some strange deadly mystery,<br> Should never gain from him an equal love;<br> Yet, as from her high-seat he &#146;gan to move,<br> She said, "O Ancient Knight, come presently,<br> When we have done this muster, unto me,<br> And thou shalt have thy charge and due command<br> For freeing from our foes this wretched land!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Ogier made his reverence and went,<br> And somewhat could perceive of her intent;<br> For in his heart life grew, and love with life<br> Grew, and therewith, twixt love and fame, was strife.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as he slowly gat him from the square,<br> Gazing at all the people gathered there,<br> A squire of the Queen's behind him came,<br> And breathless, called him by his new-coined name,<br> And bade him turn because the Queen now bade,<br> Since by the muster long she might be stayed,<br> That to the palace he should bring him straight,<br> Midst sport and play her coming back to wait;<br> Then Ogier turned, nought loath, and with him went,<br> And to a postern-gate his steps he bent,<br> That Ogier knew right well in days of old;<br> Worn was it now, and the bright hues and gold<br> Upon the shields above, with lapse of days,<br> Were faded much: but now did Ogier gaze<br> Upon the garden where he walked of yore,<br> Holding the hands that he should see no more;<br> For all was changed except the palace fair,<br> That Charlemaine's own eyes had seen built there <A NAME="page_658"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 658</FONT></A><br> Ere Ogier knew him; there the squire did lead<br> The Ancient Knight, who still took little heed<br> Of all the things that by the way he said,<br> For all his thoughts were on the days long dead.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There in the painted hall he sat again,<br> And &#146;neath the pictured eyes of Charlemaine<br> He ate and drank, and felt it like a dream;<br> And midst his growing longings yet might deem<br> That he from sleep should wake up presently<br> In some fair city on the Syrian sea,<br> Or on the brown rocks of the loadstone isle.<br> But fain to be alone, within a while<br> He gat him to the garden, and there passed<br> By wondering squires and damsels, till at last,<br> Far from the merry folk who needs must play,<br> If on the world were coming its last day,<br> He sat him down, and through his mind there ran<br> Faint thoughts of that day, when, outworn and wan,<br> He lay down by the fountain-side to die.<br> But when he strove to gain clear memory<br> Of what had happed since on the isle he lay<br> Waiting for death, a hopeless castaway,<br> Thought, failing him, would rather bring again<br> His life among the peers of Charlemaine,<br> And vex his soul with hapless memories;<br> Until at last, worn out by thought of these,<br> And hopeless striving to find what was true,<br> And pondering on the deeds he had to do<br> Ere he returned, whereto he could not tell, <A NAME="page_659"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 659</FONT></A><br> Sweet sleep upon his wearied spirit fell.<br> And on the afternoon of that fair day,<br> Forgetting all, beneath the trees he lay.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile the Queen, affairs of state being done,<br> Went through the gardens with one dame alone<br> Seeking for Ogier, whom at last she found<br> Laid sleeping on the daisy-sprinkled ground,<br> Dreaming, I know not what, of other days.<br> Then on him for a while the Queen did gaze,<br> Drawing sweet poison from the lovely sight,<br> Then to her fellow turned, "The Ancient Knight&#151;<br> What means he by this word of his?" she said;<br> "He were well mated with some lovely maid<br> just pondering on the late-heard name of love."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Softly, my lady, he begins to move,"<br> Her fellow said, a woman old and grey;<br> "Look now, his arms are of another day;<br> None know him or his deeds; thy squire just said<br> He asked about the state of men long dead;<br> I fear what he may be; look, seest thou not<br> That ring that on one finger he has got,<br> Where figures strange upon the gold are wrought:<br> God grant that he from hell has not been brought<br> For our confusion, in this doleful war,<br> Who surely in enough of trouble are<br> Without such help;" then the Queen turned aside<br> Awhile, her drawn and troubled face to hide,<br> For lurking dread this speech within her stirred; <A NAME="page_660"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 660</FONT></A><br> But yet she said, "Thou sayest a foolish word,<br> This man is come against our enemies<br> To fight for us." Then down upon her knees<br> Fell the old woman by the sleeping knight,<br> And from his hand she drew with fingers light<br> The wondrous ring, and scarce again could rise<br> Ere &#146;neath the trembling Queen's bewildered eyes<br> The change began; his golden hair turned white,<br> His smooth cheek wrinkled, and his breathing light<br> Was turned to troublous struggling for his breath,<br> And on his shrunk lips lay the hand of death;<br> And, scarce less pale than he, the trembling Queen<br> Stood thinking on the beauty she had seen<br> And longed for but a little while ago,<br> Yet with her terror still her love did grow,<br> And she began to weep as though she saw<br> Her beauty e&#146;en to such an ending draw.<br> And &#146;neath her tears waking he oped his eyes,<br> And strove to speak, but nought but gasping sighs<br> His lips could utter; then he tried to reach<br> His hand to them, as though he would beseech<br> The gift of what was his: but all the while<br> The crone gazed on them with an evil smile,<br> Then holding toward the Queen that wondrous ring,<br> She said, "Why weep&#146;st thou? having this fair thing,<br> Thou, losing nought the beauty that thou hast,<br> May&#146;st watch the vainly struggling world go past,<br> Thyself unchanged." The Queen put forth her hand<br> And took the ring, and there awhile did stand <A NAME="page_661"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 661</FONT></A><br> And strove to think of it, but still in her<br> Such all-absorbing longings love did stir,<br> So young she was, of death she could not think,<br> Or what a cup eld gives to man to drink;<br> Yet on her finger had she set the ring<br> When now the life that hitherto did cling<br> To Ogier's heart seemed fading quite away,<br> And scarcely breathing with shut eyes he lay.<br> Then, kneeling down, she murmured piteously,<br> "Ah, wilt thou love me if I give it thee,<br> And thou grow&#146;st young again? what should I do<br> If with the eyes thou thus shalt gain anew<br> Thou shouldst look scorn on me?" But with that word<br> The hedge behind her, by the west wind stirred<br> Cast fear into her heart of some one nigh,<br> And therewith on his finger hastily<br> She set the ring, then rose and stood apart<br> A little way, and in her doubtful heart<br> With love and fear was mixed desire of life.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But standing so, a look with great scorn rife<br> The elder woman, turning, cast on her,<br> Pointing to Ogier, who began to stir;<br> She looked, and all she erst saw now did seem<br> To have been nothing but a hideous dream,<br> As fair and young he rose from off the ground<br> And cast a dazed and puzzled look around,<br> Like one just waked from sleep in some strange place;<br> But soon his grave eyes rested on her face,<br> And turned yet graver seeing her so pale, <A NAME="page_662"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 662</FONT></A><br> And that her eyes were pregnant with some tale<br> Of love and fear; she &#146;neath his eyes the while<br> Forced her pale lips to semblance of a smile,<br> And said, "O Ancient Knight, thou sleepest then?<br> While through this poor land range the heathen men,<br> Unmet of any but my King and Lord:<br> Nay, let us see the deeds of thine old sword."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Queen," said he, "bid me then unto this work,<br> And certes I behind no wall would lurk,<br> Nor send for succour, while a scanty folk<br> Still followed after me to break the yoke:<br> I pray thee grace for sleeping, and were fain<br> That I might rather never sleep again<br> Then have such wretched dreams as I e&#146;en now<br> Have waked from."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovelier she seemed to grow<br> Unto him as he spoke; fresh colour came<br> Into her face, as though for some sweet shame,<br> While she with tearful eyes beheld him so,<br> That somewhat even must his burnt cheek glow,<br> His heart beat faster. But again she said,<br> "Nay, will dreams burden such a mighty head?<br> Then may I too have pardon for a dream;<br> Last night in sleep I saw thee, who didst seem<br> To be the King of France; and thou and I<br> Were sitting at some great festivity<br> Within the many-peopled gold-hung place."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blush of shame was gone as on his face<br> She gazed, and saw him read her meaning clear <A NAME="page_663"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 663</FONT></A><br> And knew that no cold words she had to fear,<br> But rather that for softer speech he yearned.<br> Therefore, with love alone her smooth cheek burned;<br> Her parted lips were hungry for his kiss,<br> She trembled at the near approaching bliss;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nathless, she checked her love a little while,<br> Because she felt the old dame's curious smile<br> Upon her, and she said, "O Ancient Knight,<br> If I then read my last night's dream aright,<br> Thou art come here our very help to be,<br> Perchance to give my husband back to me;<br> Come then, if thou this land art fain to save,<br> And show the wisdom thou must surely have<br> Unto my council; I will give thee then<br> What charge I may among my valiant men;<br> And certes thou wilt do so well herein,<br> That, ere long, something greater shalt thou win:<br> Come, then, deliverer of my throne and land,<br> And let me touch for once thy mighty hand<br> With these weak fingers."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she spoke, she met<br> His eager hand, and all things did forget<br> But for one moment, for too wise were they<br> To cast the coming years of joy away;<br> Then with her other hand her gown she raised<br> And led him thence, and o&#146;er her shoulder gazed<br> At her old follower with a doubtful smile,<br> As though to say, "Be wise, I know thy guile!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But slowly she behind the lovers walked, <A NAME="page_664"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 664</FONT></A><br> Muttering, "So be it! thou shalt not be balked<br> Of thy desire; be merry! I am wise,<br> Nor will I rob thee of thy Paradise<br> For any other than myself; and thou<br> May'st even happen to have had enow<br> Of this new love, before I get the ring,<br> And I may work for thee no evil thing."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now ye shall know that the old chronicle,<br> Wherein I read all this, doth duly tell<br> Of all the gallant deeds that Ogier did,<br> There may ye read them; nor let me be chid<br> If I therefore say little of these things,<br> Because the thought of Avallon still clings<br> Unto my heart, and scarcely can I bear<br> To think of that long, dragging, useless year,<br> Through which, with dulled and glimmering memory,<br> Ogier was grown content to live and die<br> Like other men; but this I have to say,<br> That in the council chamber on that day<br> The Old Knight showed his wisdom well enow,<br> While fainter still with love the Queen did grow<br> Hearing his words, beholding his grey eyes<br> Flashing with fire of warlike memories;<br> Yea, at the last he seemed so wise indeed<br> That she could give him now the charge, to lead<br> One wing of the great army that set out<br> From Paris&#146; gates, midst many a wavering shout,<br> Midst trembling prayers, and unchecked wails and tears, <A NAME="page_665"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 665</FONT></A><br> And slender hopes and unresisted fears.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now ere he went, upon his bed he lay,<br> Newly awakened at the dawn of day,<br> Gathering perplexed thoughts of many a thing,<br> When, midst the carol that the birds did sing<br> Unto the coming of the hopeful sun,<br> He heard a sudden lovesome song begun<br> &#146;Twixt two young voices in the garden green,<br> That seemed indeed the farewell of the Queen.</p>  
<p align="center">SONG.</p>

<p>Soothed by the pleasure that the music brought<br> And sweet desire, and vague and dreamy thought<br> Of happiness it seemed to promise him,<br> He lay and listened till his eyes grew dim,<br> And o&#146;er him &#146;gan forgetfulness to creep<br> Till in the growing light he lay asleep,<br> Nor woke until the clanging trumpet-blast<br> Had summoned him all thought away to cast:<br> Yet one more joy of love indeed he had<br> Ere with the battle's noise he was made glad;<br> For, as on that May morning forth they rode<br> And passed before the Queen's most fair abode, <A NAME="page_667"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 667</FONT></A><br> There at a window was she waiting them<br> In fair attire with gold in every hem,<br> And as the Ancient Knight beneath her passed<br> A wreath of flowering white-thorn down she cast,<br> And looked farewell to him, and forth he set<br> Thinking of all the pleasure he should get<br> From love and war, forgetting Avallon<br> And all that lovely life so lightly won;<br> Yea, now indeed the earthly life o&#146;erpast<br> Ere on the loadstone rock his ship was cast<br> Was waxing dim, nor yet at all he learned<br> To &#146;scape the fire that erst his heart had burned.<br> And he forgat his deeds, forgat his fame,<br> Forgat the letters of his ancient name<br> As one waked fully shall forget a dream,<br> That once to him a wondrous tale did seem.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I, though writing here no chronicle<br> E&#146;en as I said, must nathless shortly tell<br> That, ere the army Rouen's gates could gain<br> By a broad arrow had the King been slain,<br> And helpless now the wretched country lay<br> Beneath the yoke, until the glorious day<br> When Ogier fell at last upon the foe,<br> And scattered them as helplessly as though<br> They had been beaten men without a name:<br> So when to Paris town once more he came<br> Few folk the memory of the King did keep<br> Within their hearts, and if the folk did weep <A NAME="page_668"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 668</FONT></A><br> At his returning, &#146;twas for joy indeed<br> That such a man had risen at their need<br> To work for them so great deliverance,<br> And loud they called on him for King of France.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the Queen's heart were the more a-flame<br> For all that she had heard of his great fame,<br> I know not; rather with some hidden dread<br> Of coming fate, she heard her lord was dead,<br> And her false dream seemed coming true at last,<br> For the clear sky of love seemed overcast<br> With clouds of God's great judgments, and the fear<br> Of hate and final parting drawing near.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now when he before her throne did stand<br> Amidst the throng as saviour of the land,<br> And she her eyes to his kind eyes did raise,<br> And there before all her own love must praise;<br> Then did she fall a-weeping, and folk said,<br> "See, how she sorrows for the newly dead!<br> Amidst our joy she needs must think of him;<br> Let be, full surely shall her grief wax dim<br> And she shall wed again."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So passed the year,<br> While Ogier set himself the land to clear<br> Of broken remnants of the heathen men,<br> And at the last, when May-time came again,<br> Must he be crowned King of the twice-saved land,<br> And at the altar take the fair Queen's hand<br> And wed her for his own. And now by this <A NAME="page_669"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 669</FONT></A><br> Had he forgotten clean the woe and bliss<br> Of his old life, and still was he made glad<br> As other men; and hopes and fears he had<br> As others, and bethought him not at all<br> Of what strange days upon him yet should fall<br> When he should live and these again be dead.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now drew the time round when he should be wed,<br> And in his palace on his bed he lay<br> Upon the dawning of the very day:<br> &#146;Twixt, sleep and waking was he, and could hear<br> E&#146;en at that hour, through the bright morn and clear,<br> The hammering of the folk who toiled to make<br> Some well-wrought stages for the pageant's sake,<br> Though hardly yet the sparrows had begun<br> To twitter o&#146;er the coming of the sun,<br> Nor through the palace did a creature move.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There in the sweet entanglement of love<br> Midst languid thoughts of greater bliss he lay,<br> Remembering no more of that other day<br> Than the hot noon remembereth of the night,<br> Than summer thinketh of the winter white.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that sweet hour he heard a voice that cried,<br> "Ogier, Ogier!" then, opening his eyes wide,<br> And rising on his elbow, gazed around,<br> And strange to him and empty was the sound<br> Of his own name; "Whom callest thou?" he said,<br> For I, the man who lies upon this bed,<br> Am Charles of France, and shall be King to-day, <A NAME="page_670"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 670</FONT></A><br> But in a year that now is past away<br> The Ancient Knight they called me: who is this,<br> Thou tallest Ogier, then, what deeds are his?<br> And who art thou?" But at that word a sigh,<br> As of one grieved, came from some place anigh<br> His bed-side, and a soft voice spake again,<br> "This Ogier once was great amongst great men;<br> To Italy a helpless hostage led;<br> He saved the King when the false Lombard fled,<br> Bore forth the Oriflamme and gained the day;<br> Charlot he brought back, whom men led away,<br> And fought a day-long fight with Caraheu.<br> The ravager of Rome his right hand slew;<br> Nor did he fear the might of Charlemaine,<br> Who for a dreary year beset in vain<br> &#151;His lonely castle; yet at last caught then,<br> And shut in hold, needs must he come again<br> To give an unhoped great deliverance<br> Unto the burdened helpless land of France:<br> Denmark he gained thereafter, and he wore<br> The crown of England drawn from trouble sore;<br> At Tyre then he reigned, and Babylon<br> With mighty deeds he from the foemen won;<br> And when scarce aught could give him greater fame,<br> He left the world still thinking on his name.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These things did Ogier, and these things didst thou,<br> Nor will I call thee by a new name now<br> Since I have spoken words of love to thee&#151;<br> Ogier, Ogier, dost thou remember me, <A NAME="page_671"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 671</FONT></A><br> E&#146;en if thou hast no thought of that past time<br> Before thou camest to our happy clime?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this was said, his mazed eyes saw indeed<br> A lovely woman clad in dainty weed<br> Beside his bed, and many a thought was stirred<br> Within his heart by that last plaintive word,<br> Though nought he said, but waited what should come.<br> "Love," said she, "I am here to bring thee home;<br> Well hast thou done all that thou cam&#146;st to do,<br> And if thou bidest here, for something new<br> Will folk begin to cry, and all thy fame<br> Shall then avail thee but for greater blame;<br> Thy love shall cease to love thee, and the earth<br> Thou lovest now shall be of little worth<br> While still thou keepest life, abhorring it.<br> Behold, in men's lives that so quickly flit<br> Thus is it, how then shall it be with thee,<br> Who some faint image of eternity<br> Hast gained through me?&#151;alas, thou heedest not!<br> On all these changing things thine heart is hot&#151;<br> Take then this gift that I have brought from far,<br> And then may&#146;st thou remember what we are;<br> The lover and the loved from long ago."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He trembled, and more memory seemed to grow<br> Within his heart as he beheld her stand,<br> Holding a glittering crown in her right hand:<br> "Ogier," she said, "arise and do on thee<br> The emblems of thy worldly sovereignty, <A NAME="page_672"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 672</FONT></A><br> For we must pass o&#146;er many a sea this morn."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rose, and in the glittering tunic worn<br> By Charlemaine he clad himself, and took<br> The ivory hand, that Charlemaine once shook<br> Over the people's head in days of old;<br> Then on his feet he set the shoes of gold,<br> And o&#146;er his shoulders threw the mantle fair,<br> And set the gold crown on his golden hair:<br> Then on the royal chair he sat him down,<br> As though he deemed the elders of the town<br> Should come to audience; and in all he seemed<br> To do these things e&#146;en as a man who dreamed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now adown the Seine the golden sun<br> Shone out, as toward him drew that lovely one<br> And took from off his head the royal crown,<br> And, smiling, on the pillow laid it down<br> And said, "Lie there, O crown of Charlemaine,<br> Worn by a mighty man, and worn in vain,<br> Because he died, and all the things he did<br> Were changed before his face by earth was hid;<br> A better crown I have for my love's head,<br> Whereby he yet shall live, when all are dead<br> His hand has helped." Then on his head she set<br> The wondrous crown, and said, "Forget, forget!<br> Forget these weary things, for thou hast much<br> Of happiness to think of."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that touch<br> He rose, a happy light gleamed in his eyes; <A NAME="page_673"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 673</FONT></A><br> And smitten by the rush of memories,<br> He stammered out, "O love! how came we here?<br> What do we in this land of Death and Fear?<br> Have I not been from thee a weary while?<br> Let us return&#151;I dreamed about the isle;<br> I dreamed of other years of strife and pain,<br> Of new years full of struggles long and vain."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took him by the hand and said, "Come, love,<br> I am not changed;" and therewith did they move<br> Unto the door, and through the sleeping place<br> Swiftly they went, and still was Ogier's face<br> Turned on her beauty, and no thought was his<br> Except the dear returning of his bliss.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the threshold of the palace-gate<br> That opened to them, she awhile did wait,<br> And turned her eyes unto the rippling Seine<br> And said, "O love, behold it once again!"<br> He turned, and gazed upon the city grey<br> Smit by the gold of that sweet morn of May;<br> He heard faint noises as of wakening folk<br> As on their heads his day of glory broke;<br> He heard the changing rush of the swift stream<br> Against the bridge-piers. All was grown a dream,<br> His work was over, his reward was come,<br> Why should he loiter longer from his home?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while she watched him silently,<br> Then beckoned him to follow with a sigh,<br> And, raising up the raiment from her feet, <A NAME="page_674"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 674</FONT></A><br> Across the threshold stepped into the street;<br> One moment on the twain the low sun shone,<br> And then the place was void, and they were gone<br> How I know not; but this I know indeed,<br> That in whatso great trouble or sore need<br> The land of France since that fair day has been,<br> No more the sword of Ogier has she seen.</p>

<p>SUCH was the tale he told of Avallon,<br> E&#146;en such an one as in days past had won<br> His youthful heart to think upon the quest;<br> But to those old hearts nigh in reach of rest,<br> Not much to be desired now it seemed&#151;<br> Perchance the heart that of such things had dreamed<br> Had found no words in this death-laden tongue<br> We speak on earth, wherewith they might be sung;<br> Perchance the changing years that changed his heart<br> E&#146;en in the words of that old tale had part,<br> Changing its sweet to bitter, to despair<br> The foolish hope that once had glittered there&#151;<br> Or think, that in some bay of that far home<br> They then had sat, and watched the green waves come<br> Up to their feet with many promises;<br> Or the light wind midst blossom-laden trees,<br> In the sweet Spring had weighted many a word<br> Of no worth now, and many a hope had stirred<br> Long dead for ever.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howsoe&#146;er that be<br> Among strange folk they now sat quietly,<br> As though that tale with them had nought to do,<br> As though its hopes and fears were something new. <A NAME="page_676"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 676</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But though, indeed, the outworn, dwindled band<br> Hail no tears left for that once longed-for land,<br> The very wind must moan for their decay,<br> And from the sky, grown dull, and low, and grey,<br> Cold tears must fall upon the lonely field,<br> That such fair golden hopes erewhile did yield;<br> And on the blackening woods, wherein the doves<br> Sat silent now, forgetful of their loves.<br> Yet, since a little life at least was left,<br> They were not yet of every joy bereft,<br> For long ago was past the agony,<br> Midst which they found that they indeed must die;<br> And now well nigh as much their pain was past<br> As though death's veil already had been cast<br> Over their heads&#151;so, midst some little mirth,<br> They watched the dark night hide the gloomy earth.</p>
