### THE SON OF CRŒSUS.

#### ARGUMENT.

CRŒSUS, king of Lydia, dreamed that he saw his Son slain by an iron
weapon, and though by every means he strove to avert this doom from him,
yet thus it happened, for his Son was slain by the hand of the man who
seemed least of all likely to do the deed.

OF Crœsus tells my tale, a king of old  
In Lydia, ere the Mede fell on the land,  
A man made mighty by great heaps of gold,  
Feared for the myriads strong of heart and hand  
That ’neath his banners wrought out his command,  
And though his latter ending fell to ill,  
Yet first of every joy he had his fill.

   Two sons he had, and one was dumb from birth;  
The other one, that Atys had to name,  
Grew up a fair youth, and of might and worth,  
And well it seemed the race wherefrom he came  
From him should never get reproach or shame:  
But yet no stroke he struck before his death,  
In no war-shout he spent his latest breath. <span id="page_531">p.
531</span>

   Now Crœsus, lying on his bed a-night,  
Dreamed that he saw this dear son lying low,  
And folk lamenting he was slain outright,  
And that some iron thing had dealt the blow;  
By whose hand guided he could nowise know,  
Or if in peace by traitors it were done,  
Or in some open war not yet begun.

   Three times one night this vision broke his sleep,  
So that at last he rose up from his bed,  
That he might ponder how he best might keep  
The threatened danger from so dear a head;  
And, since he now was old enough to wed,  
The King sent men to search the lands around,  
Until some matchless maiden should be found;

   That in her arms this Atys might forget  
The praise of men, and fame of history,  
Whereby full many a field has been made wet  
With blood of men, and many a deep green sea  
Been reddened therewithal, and yet shall be;  
That her sweet voice might drown the people's praise,  
Her eyes make bright the uneventful days.

   So when at last a wonder they had brought,  
From some sweet land down by the ocean's rim,  
Than whom no fairer could by man be thought,  
And ancient dames, scanning her limb by limb,  
Had said that she was fair enough for him, <span id="page_532">p.
532</span>  
To her was Atys married with much show,  
And looked to dwell with her in bliss enow.

   And in meantime afield he never went,  
Either to hunting or the frontier war,  
No dart was cast, nor any engine bent  
Anigh him, and the Lydian men afar  
Must rein their steeds, and the bright blossoms mar  
If they have any lust of tourney now,  
And in far meadows must they bend the bow.

   And also though the palace everywhere  
The swords and spears were taken from the wall  
That long with honour had been hanging there,  
And from the golden pillars of the hall;  
Lest by mischance some sacred blade should fall,  
And in its falling bring revenge at last  
For many a fatal battle overpast.

   And every day King Crœsus wrought with care  
To save his dear son from that threatened end,  
And many a beast he offered up with prayer  
Unto the gods, and much of wealth did spend,  
That they so prayed might yet perchance defend  
That life, until at least that he were dead,  
With earth laid heavy on his unseeing head.

   But in the midst even of the wedding feast  
There came a man, who by the golden hall <span id="page_533">p.
533</span>  
Sat down upon the steps, and man or beast  
He heeded not, but there against the wall  
He leaned his head, speaking no word at all,  
Till, with his son and son's wife, came the King,  
And then unto his gown the man did cling.

   "What man art thou?" the King said to him then,  
"That in such guise thou prayest on thy knee;  
Hast thou some fell foe here among my men?  
Or hast thou done an ill deed unto me?  
Or hast thy wife been carried over sea?  
Or hast thou on this day great need of gold?  
Or say, why else thou now art grown so bold."

   "O King," he said, "I ask no gold to-day,  
And though indeed thy greatness drew me here,  
No wrong have I that thou could’st wipe away;  
And nought of mine the pirate folk did bear  
Across the sea; none of thy folk I fear:  
But all the gods are now mine enemies,  
Therefore I kneel before thee on my knees.

   "For as with mine own brother on a day  
Within the running place at home I played,  
Unwittingly I smote him in such way  
That dead upon the green grass he was laid;  
Half-dead myself I fled away dismayed,  
Wherefore I pray thee help me in my need,  
And purify my soul of this sad deed. <span id="page_534">p. 534</span>

   "If of my name and country thou wouldst know,  
In Phrygia yet my father is a king,  
Gordius, the son of Midas, rich enow  
In corn and cattle, golden cup and ring;  
And mine own name before I did this thing  
Was called Adrastus, whom, in street and hall,  
The slayer of his brother men now call."

   "Friend," said the King, "have thou no fear of me;  
For though, indeed, I am right happy now,  
Yet well I know this may not always be,  
And I may chance some day to kneel full low,  
And to some happy man mine head to bow  
With prayers to do a greater thing than this,  
Dwell thou with us, and win again thy bliss.

   "For in this city men in sport and play  
Forget the trouble that the gods have sent;  
Who therewithal send wine, and many a may  
As fair as she for whom the Trojan went,  
And many a dear delight besides have lent,  
Which, whoso is well-loved of them shall keep  
Till in forgetful death he falls asleep.

   "Therefore to-morrow shall those rites be done  
That kindred blood demands that thou hast shed,  
That if the mouth of thine own mother's son  
Did hap to curse thee ere he was quite dead,  
The curse may lie the lighter on thy head, <span id="page_535">p.
535</span>  
Because the flower-crowned head of many a beast  
Has fallen voiceless in our glorious feast."

   Then did Adrastus rise and thank the King,  
And the next day when yet low was the sun,  
The sacrifice and every other thing  
That unto these dread rites belonged, was done;  
And there Adrastus dwelt, hated of none,  
And loved of many, and the King loved him  
For brave and wise he was and strong of limb.

   But chiefly amongst all did Atys love  
The luckless stranger, whose fair tales of war  
The Lydian's heart abundantly did move,  
And much they talked of wandering afar  
Some day, to lands where many marvels are,  
With still the Phrygian through all things to be  
The leader unto all felicity.

   Now at this time folk came unto the King  
Who on a forest's borders dwelling were,  
Wherein there roamed full many a dangerous thing,  
As wolf and wild bull, lion and brown bear;  
But chiefly in that forest was the lair  
Of a great boar that no man could withstand,  
And many a woe he wrought upon the land.

   Since long ago that men in Calydon  
Held chase, no beast like him had once been seen, <span id="page_536">p.
536</span>  
He ruined vineyards lying in the sun,  
After his harvesting the men must glean  
What he had left; right glad they had not been  
Among the tall stalks of the ripening wheat,  
The fell destroyer's fatal tusks to meet.

   For often would the lonely man entrapped  
In vain from his dire fury strive to hide  
In some thick hedge, and other whiles it happed  
Some careless stranger by his place would ride,  
And the tusks smote his fallen horse's side,  
And what help then to such a wretch could come  
With sword he could not draw, and far from home?

   Or else girls, sent their water jars to fill,  
Would come back pale, too terrified to cry,  
Because they had but seen him from the hill;  
Or else again with side rent wretchedly,  
Some hapless damsel midst the brake would lie.  
Shortly to say, there neither man nor maid  
Was safe afield whether they wrought or played.

   Therefore were come these dwellers by the wood  
To pray the king brave men to them to send,  
That they might live; and if he deemed it good,  
That Atys with the other knights should wend,  
They thought their grief the easier should have end;  
For both by gods and men they knew him loved,  
And easily by hope of glory moved. <span id="page_537">p. 537</span>

   "O Sire," they said, "thou know’st how Hercules  
Was not content to wait till folk asked aid,  
But sought the pests among their guarded trees;  
Thou know’st what name the Theban Cadmus made,  
And how the bull of Marathon was laid  
Dead on the fallows of the Athenian land,  
And how folk worshipped Atalanta's hand.

   "Fair would thy son's name look upon the roll  
Wherein such noble deeds as this are told;  
And great delight shall surely fill thy soul,  
Thinking upon his deeds when thou art old,  
And thy brave heart is waxen faint and cold:  
Dost thou not know, O King, how men will strive  
That they, when dead, still in their sons may live?"

   He shuddered as they spoke, because he thought,  
Most certainly a winning tale is this  
To draw him from the net where he is caught,  
For hearts of men grow weary of all bliss;  
Nor is he one to be content with his,  
If he should hear the trumpet-blast of fame  
And far-off people calling on his name.

   "Good friends," he said, "go, get ye back again,  
And doubt not I will send you men to slay  
This pest ye fear: yet shall your prayer be vain  
If ye with any other speak to-day;  
And for my son, with me he needs must stay, <span id="page_538">p.
538</span>  
For mighty cares oppress the Lydian land.  
Fear not, for ye shall have a noble band."

   And with that promise must. they be content,  
And so departed, having feasted well.  
And yet some god or other ere they went,  
If they were silent, this their tale must tell  
To more than one man; therefore it befell,  
That at the last Prince Atys knew the thing,  
And came with angry eyes unto the King.

   "Father," he said, "since when am I grown vile?  
Since when am I grown helpless of my hands?  
Or else what folk, with words enwrought with guile,  
Thine ears have poisoned; that when far-off lands  
My fame might fill, by thy most strange commands  
I needs must stay within this slothful home,  
Whereto would God that I had never come?

   "What! wilt thou take mine honour quite away?  
Wouldst thou, that, as with her I just have wed  
I sit among thy folk at end of day,  
She should be ever turning round her head  
To watch some man for war apparelled,  
Because he wears a sword that he may use,  
Which grace to me thou ever wilt refuse?

   "Or dost thou think, when thou hast run thy race  
And thou art gone, and in thy stead I reign, <span id="page_539">p.
539</span>  
The people will do honour to my place,  
Or that the lords leal men will still remain,  
If yet my father's sword be sharp in vain?  
If on the wall his armour still hang up,  
While for a spear I hold a drinking-cup?"

   "O Son!" quoth Crœsus, "well I know thee brave,  
And worthy of high deeds of chivalry;  
Therefore the more thy dear life would I save,  
Which now is threatened by the gods on high;  
Three times one night I dreamed I saw thee die,  
Slain by some deadly iron-pointed thing,  
While weeping lords stood round thee in a ring."

   Then loud laughed Atys, and he said again,  
"Father, and did this ugly dream tell thee  
What day it was on which I should be slain?  
As may the gods grant I may one day be,  
And not from sickness die right wretchedly,  
Groaning with pain, my lords about my bed,  
Wishing to God that I were fairly dead;

   "But slain in battle, as the Lydian kings  
Have died ere now, in some great victory,  
While all about the Lydian shouting rings  
Death to the beaten foemen as they fly.  
What death but this, O father! should I die?  
But if my life by iron shall be done,  
What steel to-day shall glitter in the sun? <span id="page_540">p.
540</span>

   "Yea, father, if to thee it seemeth good  
To keep me from the bright steel-bearing throng,  
Let me be brave at least within the wood;  
For surely, if thy dream be true, no wrong  
Can hap to me from this beast's tushes strong:  
Unless perchance the beast is grown so wise,  
He haunts the forest clad in Lydian guise."

   Then Crœsus said: "O Son, I love thee so,  
That thou shalt do thy will upon this tide:  
But since unto this hunting thou must go,  
A trusty friend along with thee shall ride,  
Who not for anything shall leave thy side.  
I think, indeed, he loves thee well enow  
To thrust his heart ’twixt thee and any blow.

   "Go then, O Son, and if by some short span  
Thy life be measured, how shall it harm thee,  
If while life last thou art a happy man?  
And thou art happy; only unto me  
Is trembling left, and infelicity:  
The trembling of the man who loves on earth,  
But unto thee is hope and present mirth.

   "Nay, be thou not ashamed, for on this day  
I fear not much: thou read’st my dream aright,  
No teeth or claws shall take thy life away.  
And it may chance, ere thy last glorious fight,  
I shall be blinded by the endless night; <span id="page_541">p.
541</span>  
And brave Adrastus on this day shall be  
Thy safeguard, and shall give good heart to me.

   "Go then, and send him hither, and depart;  
And as the heroes did mayst thou too do,  
Winning such fame as well may please thine heart."  
With that word from the King did Atys go,  
Who, left behind, sighed, saying "May it be so,  
Even as I hope; and yet I would to God  
These men upon my threshold ne’er had trod."

   So when Adrastus to the King was come  
He said unto him, "O my Phrygian friend,  
We in this land have given you a fair home,  
And ’gainst all foes your life will we defend:  
Wherefore for us that life thou shouldest spend,  
If any day there should be need therefore;  
And now a trusty friend I need right sore.

   "Doubtless ere now thou hast heard many say  
There is a doom that threatens my son's life;  
Therefore this place is stript of arms to-day,  
And therefore still bides Atys with his wife,  
And tempts not any god by raising strife;  
Yet none the less by no desire of his,  
To whom would war be most abundant bliss.

   "And since to-day some glory he may gain  
Against a monstrous bestial enemy <span id="page_542">p. 542</span>  
And that the meaning of my dream is plain;  
That saith that he by steel alone shall die,  
His burning wish I may not well deny,  
Therefore afield to-morrow doth he wend  
And herein mayst thou show thyself my friend—

   "For thou as captain of his band shalt ride,  
And keep a watchful eye of everything,  
Nor leave him whatsoever may betide:  
Lo, thou art brave, the son of a great king,  
And with thy praises doth this city ring,  
Why should I tell thee what a name those gain,  
Who dying for their friends, die not in vain."

   Then said Adrastus, "Now were I grown base  
Beyond all words, if I should spare for aught  
In guarding him, so sit with smiling face,  
And of this matter take no further thought,  
Because with my life shall his life be bought,  
If ill should hap; and no ill fate it were,  
If I should die for what I hold so dear."

   Then went Adrastus, and next morn all things,  
That 'longed unto the hunting were well dight,  
And forth they went clad as the sons of kings,  
Fair was the morn, as through the sunshine bright  
They rode, the prince half-wild with great delight  
The Phrygian smiling on him soberly,  
And ever looking round with watchful eye. <span id="page_543">p.
543</span>

   So through the city all the rout rode fast,  
With many a great black-muzzled yellow hound  
And then the teeming country-side they passed,  
Until they came to sour and rugged ground,  
And there rode up a little heathy mound,  
That overlooked the scrubby woods and low,  
That of the beast's lair somewhat they might know.

   And there a good man of the country-side  
Showed them the places where he mostly lay;  
And they, descending, through the wood did ride,  
And followed on his tracks for half the day.  
And at the last they brought him well to bay,  
Within an oozy space amidst the wood,  
About the which a ring of alders stood.

   So when the hounds’ changed voices clear they heard,  
With hearts aflame on towards him straight they drew;  
Atys the first of all, of nought afeard,  
Except that folk should say some other slew  
The beast; and lustily his horn he blew,  
Going afoot; then, mighty spear in hand,  
Adrastus headed all the following band.

   Now when they came unto the plot of ground  
Where stood the boar, hounds dead about him lay  
Or sprawled about, bleeding from many a wound,  
But still the others held him well at bay,  
Nor had he been bestead thus ere that day. <span id="page_544">p.
544</span>  
But yet, seeing Atys, straight he rushed at him,  
Speckled with foam, bleeding in flank and limb.

   Then Atys stood and cast his well-steeled spear  
With a great shout, and straight and well it flew;  
For now the broad blade cutting through the ear,  
A stream of blood from out the shoulder drew.  
And therewithal another, no less true,  
Adrastus cast, whereby the boar had died:  
But Atys drew the bright sword from his side,

   And to the tottering beast he drew anigh:  
But as the sun's rays ran adown the blade  
Adrastus threw a javelin hastily,  
For of the mighty beast was he afraid,  
Lest by his wounds he should not yet be stayed,  
But with a last rush cast his life away,  
And dying there, the son of Crœsus slay.

   But even as the feathered dart he hurled,  
His strained, despairing eyes, beheld the end,  
And changed seemed all the fashion of the world,  
And past and future into one did blend,  
As he beheld the fixed eyes of his friend,  
That no reproach had in them, and no fear,  
For Death had seized him ere he thought him near.

   Adrastus shrieked, and running up he caught  
The falling man, and from his bleeding side <span id="page_545">p.
545</span>  
Drew out the dart, and seeing that death had brought  
Deliverance to him, he thereby had died;  
But ere his hand the luckless steel could guide,  
And he the refuge of poor souls could win,  
The horror-stricken huntsmen had rushed in.

   And these, with blows and cries he heeded nought,  
His unresisting hands made haste to bind;  
Then of the alder-boughs a bier they wrought,  
And laid the corpse thereon, and ’gan to wind  
Homeward amidst the tangled wood and blind,  
And going slowly, at the eventide,  
Some leagues from Sardis did that day abide.

   Onward next morn the slaughtered man they bore,  
With him that slew him, and at end of day  
They reached the city, and with mourning sore  
Toward the king's palace did they take their way.  
He in an open western chamber lay  
Feasting, though inwardly his heart did burn  
Until that Atys should to him return.

   And when those wails first smote upon his ear  
He set the wine-cup down, and to his feet  
He rose, and bitter all-consuming fear  
Swallowed his joy, and nigh he went to meet  
That which was coming through the weeping street:  
But in the end he thought it good to wait,  
And stood there doubting all the ills of fate. <span id="page_546">p.
546</span>

   But when at last up to that royal place  
Folk brought the thing he once had held so dear,  
Still stood the King, staring with ghastly face  
As they brought forth Adrastus and the bier,  
But spoke at last, slowly without a tear,  
"O Phrygian man, that I did purify,  
Is it through thee that Atys came to die?"

   "O King," Adrastus said, "take now my life,  
With whatso torment seemeth good to thee,  
As my word went, for I would end this strife,  
And underneath the earth lie quietly;  
Nor is it my will here alive to be:  
For as my brother, so Prince Atys died,  
And this unlucky hand some god did guide."

   Then as a man constrained, the tale he told  
From end to end, nor spared himself one whit:  
And as he spoke, the wood did still behold,  
The trodden grass, and Atys dead on it;  
And many a change o’er the King's face did flit  
Of kingly rage, and hatred and despair,  
As on the slayer's face he still did stare.

   At last he said, "Thy death avails me nought,  
The gods themselves have done this bitter deed,  
That I was all too happy was their thought,  
Therefore thy heart is dead and mine doth bleed,  
And I am helpless as a trodden weed: <span id="page_547">p. 547</span>  
Thou art but as the handle of the spear,  
The caster sits far off from any fear.

   "Yet, if thy hurt they meant, I can do this,—  
—Loose him and let him go in peace from me—  
I will not slay the slayer of all my bliss;  
Yet go, poor man, for when thy face I see  
I curse the gods for their felicity.  
Surely some other slayer they would have found,  
If thou hadst long ago been under ground.

   "Alas, Adrastus! in my inmost heart  
I knew the gods would one day do this thing,  
But deemed indeed that it would be thy part  
To comfort me amidst my sorrowing;  
Make haste to go, for I am still a King!  
Madness may take me, I have many hands  
Who will not spare to do my worst commands."

   With that Adrastus’ bonds were done away,  
And forthwith to the city gates he ran,  
And on the road where they had been that day  
Rushed through the gathering night; and some lone man  
Beheld next day his visage wild and wan,  
Peering from out a thicket of the wood  
Where he had spilt that well-beloved blood.

   And now the day of burial pomp must be,  
And to those rites all lords of Lydia came <span id="page_548">p.
548</span>  
About the King, and that day, they and he  
Cast royal gifts of rich things on the flame;  
But while they stood and wept, and called by name  
Upon the dead, amidst them came a man  
With raiment rent, and haggard face and wan:

   Who when the marshals would have thrust him out  
And men looked strange on him, began to say,  
"Surely the world is changed since ye have doubt  
Of who I am; nay, turn me not away,  
For ye have called me princely ere to-day—  
Adrastus, son of Gordius a great King,  
Where unto Pallas Phrygian maidens sing.

   "O Lydians, many a rich thing have ye cast  
Into this flame, but I myself will give  
A greater gift, since now I see at last  
The gods are wearied for that still I live,  
And with their will, why should I longer strive?  
Atys, O Atys, thus I give to thee  
A life that lived for thy felicity."

   And therewith from his side a knife he drew,  
And, crying out, upon the pile he leapt,  
And with one mighty stroke himself he slew.  
So there these princes both together slept,  
And their light ashes, gathered up, were kept  
Within a golden vessel wrought all o’er  
With histories of this hunting of the boar.

 

<span id="page_549">p. 549</span>

A GENTLE wind had risen midst his tale,  
That bore the sweet scents of the fertile vale  
In at the open windows; and these men  
The burden of their years scarce noted then,  
Soothed by the sweet luxurious summer time,  
And by the cadence of that ancient rhyme,  
Spite of its saddening import; nay, indeed,  
Of some such thoughts the Wanderers had need  
As that tale gave them—Yea, a man shall be  
A wonder for his glorious chivalry,  
First in all wisdom, of a prudent mind.  
Yet none the less him too his fate shall find  
Unfenced by these, a man ’mongst other men.  
Yea, and will Fortune pick out, now and then,  
The noblest for the anvil of her blows;  
Great names are few, and yet, indeed, who knows  
What greater souls have fallen ’neath the stroke  
Of careless fate? Purblind are most of folk,  
The happy are the masters of the earth  
Which ever give small heed to hapless worth;  
So goes the world, and this we needs must bear  
Like eld and death: yet there were some men there  
Who drank in silence to the memory  
Of those who failed on earth great men to be,  
Though better than the men who won the crown. <span id="page_550">p.
550</span>  
   But when the sun was fairly going down  
They left the house, and, following up the stream,  
In the low sun saw the kingfisher gleam  
Twixt bank and alder, and the grebe steal out  
From the high sedge, and, in his restless doubt,  
Dive down, and rise to see what men were there;  
They saw the swallow chase high up in air  
The circling gnats; the shaded dusky pool  
Broke by the splashing chub; the ripple cool,  
Rising and falling, of some distant weir  
They heard, till it oppressed the listening ear,  
As twilight grew: so back they turned again  
Glad of their rest, and pleasure after pain.

 

<span id="page_551">p. 551</span>

WITHIN the gardens once again they met,  
That now the roses did well nigh-forget,  
For hot July was drawing to an end,  
And August came the fainting year to mend  
With fruit and grain; so ’neath the trellises,  
Nigh blossomless, did they lie well at ease,  
And watched the poppies burn across the grass,  
And o’er the bindweed's bells the brown bee pass  
Still murmuring of his gains: windless and bright  
The morn had been, to help their dear delight;  
But heavy clouds ere noon grew round the sun,  
And, halfway to the zenith, wild and dun  
The sky grew, and the thunder growled afar;  
But, ere the steely clouds began their war,  
A change there came, and, as by some great hand,  
The clouds that hung in threatening o’er the land  
Were drawn away; then a light wind arose  
That shook the light stems of that flowery close,  
And made men sigh for pleasure; therewithal  
Did mirth upon the feasting elders fall,  
And they no longer watched the lowering sky,  
But called aloud for some new history.  
   Then spoke the Suabian, "Sirs, this tale is told  
Among our searchers for fine stones and gold,  
And though I tell it wrong be good to me;  
For I the written book did never see,  
Made by some Fleming, as I think, wherein  
Is told this tale of wilfulness and sin."
