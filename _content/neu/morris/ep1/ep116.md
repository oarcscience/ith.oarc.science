### THE LADY OF THE LAND.

#### ARGUMENT.

A CERTAIN Man having landed on an Island in the Greek Sea, found there a
beautiful damsel, whom he would fain have delivered from a strange and
dreadful doom, but failing herein, he died soon afterwards.

IT happened once, some men of Italy  
Midst the Greek islands went a sea-roving,  
And much good fortune had they on the sea:  
Of many a man they had the ransoming,  
And many a chain they gat, and goodly thing;  
And midst their voyage to an isle they came,  
Whereof my story keepeth not the name.

   Now though but little was there left to gain,  
Because the richer folk had gone away,  
Yet since by this of water they were fain  
They came to anchor in a land-locked bay,  
Whence in a while some went ashore to play,  
Going but lightly armed in twos or threes,  
For midst that folk they feared no enemies. <span id="page_507">p.
507</span>

   And of these fellows that thus went ashore,  
One was there who left all his friends behind;  
Who going inland ever more and more,  
And being left quite alone, at last did find  
A lonely valley sheltered from the wind,  
Wherein, amidst an ancient cypress wood,  
A long-deserted ruined castle stood.

   The wood, once ordered in fair grove and glade,  
With gardens overlooked by terraces,  
And marble-paved pools for pleasure made,  
Was tangled now, and choked with fallen trees;  
And he who went there, with but little ease  
Must stumble by the stream's side, once made meet  
For tender women's dainty wandering feet.

   The raven's croak, the low wind choked and drear,  
The baffled stream, the grey wolf's doleful cry,  
Were all the sounds that mariner could hear,  
As through the wood he wandered painfully;  
But as unto the house he drew anigh,  
The pillars of a ruined shrine he saw,  
The once fair temple of a fallen law.

   No image was there left behind to tell  
Before whose face the knees of men had bowed;  
An altar of black stone, of old wrought well,  
Alone beneath a ruined roof now showed  
The goal whereto the folk were wont to crowd, <span id="page_508">p.
508</span>  
Seeking for things forgotten long ago,  
Praying for heads long ages laid a-low.

   Close to the temple was the castle-gate,  
Doorless and crumbling; there our fellow turned,  
Trembling indeed at what might chance to wait  
The prey entrapped, yet with a heart that burned  
To know the most of what might there be learned,  
And hoping somewhat too, amid his fear,  
To light on such things as all men hold dear.

   Noble the house was, nor seemed built for war,  
But rather like the work of other days,  
When men, in better peace than now they are,  
Had leisure on the world around to gaze,  
And noted well the past times’ changing ways;  
And fair with sculptured stories it was wrought,  
By lapse of time unto dim ruin brought.

   Now as he looked about on all these things,  
And strove to read the mouldering histories,  
Above the door an image with wide wings,  
Whose unclad limbs a serpent seemed to seize,  
He dimly saw, although the western breeze,  
And years of biting frost and biting rain,  
Had made the carver's labour well-nigh vain.

   But this, though perished sore, and worn away,  
He noted well, because it seemed to be, <span id="page_509">p.
509</span>  
After the fashion of another day,  
Some great man's badge of war, or armoury,  
And round it a carved wreath he seemed to see:  
But taking note of these things, at the last  
The mariner beneath the gateway passed.

   And there a lovely cloistered court he found,  
A fountain in the midst o’erthrown and dry,  
And in the cloister briers twining round  
The slender shafts; the wondrous imagery  
Outworn by more than many years gone by,  
Because the country people, in their fear  
Of wizardry, had wrought destruction here;

   And piteously these fair things had been maimed;  
There stood great Jove, lacking his head of might;  
Here was the archer, swift Apollo, lamed;  
The shapely limbs of Venus hid from sight  
By weeds and shards; Diana's ankles light  
Bound with the cable of some coasting ship;  
And rusty nails through Helen's maddening lip.

   Therefrom unto the chambers did he pass,  
And found them fair still, midst of their decay,  
Though in them now no sign of man there was,  
And everything but stone had passed away  
That made them lovely in that vanished day;  
Nay, the mere walls themselves would soon be gone  
And nought be left but heaps of mouldering stone. <span id="page_510">p.
510</span>

   But he, when all the place he had gone o’er,  
And with much trouble clomb the broken stair,  
And from the topmost turret seen the shore  
And his good ship drawn up at anchor there,  
Came down again, and found a crypt most fair  
Built wonderfully beneath the greatest hall,  
And there he saw a door within the wall,

   Well-hinged, close shut; nor was there in that place  
Another on its hinges, therefore he  
Stood there and pondered for a little space,  
And thought, "Perchance some marvel I shall see,  
For surely here some dweller there must be,  
Because this door seems whole, and new, and sound,  
While nought but ruin I can see around."

   So with that word, moved by a strong desire,  
He tried the hasp, that yielded to his hand,  
And in a strange place, lit as by a fire  
Unseen but near, he presently did stand;  
And by an odorous breeze his face was fanned,  
As though in some Arabian plain he stood,  
Anigh the border of a spice-tree wood.

   He moved not for awhile, but looking round,  
He wondered much to see the place so fair,  
Because, unlike the castle above ground,  
No pillager or wrecker had been there;  
It seemed that time had passed on otherwhere, <span id="page_511">p.
511</span>  
Nor laid a finger on this hidden place,  
Rich with the wealth of some forgotten race.

   With hangings, fresh as when they left the loom,  
The walls were hung a space above the head,  
Slim ivory chairs were set about the room,  
And in one corner was a dainty bed,  
That seemed for some fair queen apparelled;  
And marble was the worst stone of the floor,  
That with rich Indian webs was covered o’er.

   The wanderer trembled when he saw all this,  
Because he deemed by magic it was wrought;  
Yet in his heart a longing for some bliss,  
Whereof the hard and changing world knows nought,  
Arose and urged him on, and dimmed the thought  
That there perchance some devil lurked to slay  
The heedless wanderer from the light of day.

   Over against him was another door  
Set in the wall, so, casting fear aside,  
With hurried steps he crossed the varied floor,  
And there again the silver latch he tried  
And with no pain the door he opened wide,  
And entering the new chamber cautiously  
The glory of great heaps of gold could see.

   Upon the floor uncounted medals lay,  
Like things of little value; here and there <span id="page_512">p.
512</span>  
Stood golden caldrons, that might well outweigh  
The biggest midst an emperor's copper ware,  
And golden cups were set on tables fair,  
Themselves of gold; and in all hollow things  
Were stored great gems, worthy the crowns of kings.

   The walls and roof with gold were overlaid,  
And precious raiment from the wall hung down;  
The fall of kings that treasure might have stayed,  
Or gained some longing conqueror great renown,  
Or built again some god-destroyed old town;  
What wonder, if this plunderer of the sea  
Stood gazing at it long and dizzily?

   But at the last his troubled eyes and dazed  
He lifted from the glory of that gold,  
And then the image, that well-nigh erased  
Over the castle-gate he did behold,  
Above a door well wrought in coloured gold  
Again he saw; a naked girl with wings  
Enfolded in a serpent's scaly rings.

   And even as his eyes were fixed on it  
A woman's voice came from the other side,  
And through his heart strange hopes began to flit  
That in some wondrous land he might abide  
Not dying, master of a deathless bride,  
So o’er the gold he scarcely now could see  
He went, and passed this last door eagerly. <span id="page_513">p.
513</span>

   Then in a room he stood wherein there was  
A marble bath, whose brimming water yet  
Was scarcely still; a vessel of green glass  
Half-full of odorous ointment was there set  
Upon the topmost step that still was wet,  
And jewelled shoes and women's dainty gear,  
Lay cast upon the varied pavement near.

   In one quick glance these things his eyes did see,  
But speedily they turned round to behold  
Another sight, for throned on ivory  
There sat a girl, whose dripping tresses rolled  
On to the floor in waves of gleaming gold,  
Cast back from such a form as, erewhile shown  
To one poor shepherd, lighted up Troy town.

   Naked she was, the kisses of her feet  
Upon the floor a dying path had made  
From the full bath unto her ivory seat;  
In her right hand, upon her bosom laid,  
She held a golden comb, a mirror weighed  
Her left hand down, aback her fair head lay  
Dreaming awake of some long vanished day.

   Her eyes were shut, but she seemed not to sleep,  
Her lips were murmuring things unheard and low,  
Or sometimes twitched as though she needs must weep  
Though from her eyes the tears refused to flow,  
And oft with heavenly red her cheek did glow, <span id="page_514">p.
514</span>  
As if remembrance of some half-sweet shame  
Across the web of many memories came.

   There stood the man, scarce daring to draw breath  
For fear the lovely sight should fade away;  
Forgetting heaven, forgetting life and death,  
Trembling for fear lest something he should say  
Unwitting, lest some sob should yet betray  
His presence there, for to his eager eyes  
Already did the tears begin to rise.

   But as he gazed she moved, and with a sigh  
Bent forward, dropping down her golden head;  
"Alas, alas! another day gone by,  
Another day and no soul come," she said;  
"Another year, and still I am not dead!"  
And with that word once more her head she raised,  
And on the trembling man with great eyes gazed.

   Then he imploring hands to her did reach,  
And toward her very slowly ’gan to move  
And with wet eyes her pity did beseech,  
And seeing her about to speak he strove  
From trembling lips to utter words of love;  
But with a look she stayed his doubtful feet,  
And made sweet music as their eyes did meet.

   For now she spoke in gentle voice and clear,  
Using the Greek tongue that he knew full well; <span id="page_515">p.
515</span>  
"What man art thou, that thus hast wandered here,  
And found this lonely chamber where I dwell?  
Beware, beware! for I have many a spell;  
If greed of power and gold have led thee on,  
Not lightly shall this untold wealth be won.

   "But if thou com’st here, knowing of my tale,  
In hope to bear away my body fair,  
Stout must thine heart be, nor shall that avail  
If thou a wicked heart in thee dost bear;  
So once again I bid thee to beware,  
Because no base man things like this may see,  
And live thereafter long and happily."

   "Lady," he said, "in Florence is my home,  
And in my city noble is my name;  
Neither on peddling voyage am I come,  
But, like my fathers, bent to gather fame;  
And though thy face has set my heart a-flame  
Yet of thy story nothing do I know,  
But here have wandered heedlessly enow.

   "But since the sight of thee mine eyes did bless,  
What can I be but thine? what wouldst thou have?  
From those thy words, I deem from some distress  
By deeds of mine thy dear life I might save;  
O then, delay not! if one ever gave  
His life to any, mine I give to thee;  
Come, tell me what the price of love must be? <span id="page_516">p.
516</span>

   "Swift death, to be with thee a day and night  
And with the earliest dawning to be slain?  
Or better, a long year of great delight,  
And many years of misery and pain?  
Or worse, and this poor hour for all my gain?  
A sorry merchant am I on this day,  
E’en as thou wiliest so must I obey."

   She said, "What brave words! nought divine am I,  
But an unhappy and unheard-of maid  
Compelled by evil fate and destiny  
To live, who long ago should have been laid  
Under the earth within the cypress shade.  
Hearken awhile, and quickly shalt thou know  
What deed I pray thee to accomplish now.

   "God grant indeed thy words are not for nought!  
Then shalt thou save me, since for many a day  
To such a dreadful life I have been brought:  
Nor will I spare with all my heart to pay  
What man soever takes my grief away;  
Ah! I will love thee, if thou lovest me  
But well enough my saviour now to be.

   "My father lived a many years agone  
Lord of this land, master of all cunning,  
Who ruddy gold could draw from out grey stone,  
And gather wealth from many an uncouth thing,  
He made the wilderness rejoice and sing, <span id="page_517">p.
517</span>  
And such a leech he was that none could say  
Without his word what soul should pass away.

   Unto Diana such a gift he gave,  
Goddess above, below, and on the earth,  
That I should be her virgin and her slave  
From the first hour of my most wretched birth;  
Therefore my life had known but little mirth  
When I had come unto my twentieth year  
And the last time of hallowing drew anear.

   "So in her temple had I lived and died  
And all would long ago have passed away,  
But ere that time came, did strange things betide,  
Whereby I am alive unto this day;  
Alas, the bitter words that I must say!  
Ah! can I bring my wretched tongue to tell  
How I was brought unto this fearful hell.

   "A queen I was, what gods I knew I loved,  
And nothing evil was there in my thought,  
And yet by love my wretched heart was moved  
Until to utter ruin I was brought!  
Alas! thou sayest our gods were vain and nought,  
Wait, wait, till thou hast heard this tale of mine,  
Then shalt thou think them devilish or divine.

   "Hearken! in spite of father and of vow  
I loved a man; but for that sin I think <span id="page_518">p.
518</span>  
Men had forgiven me—yea, yea, even thou;  
But from the gods the full cup must I drink,  
And into misery unheard-of sink,  
Tormented when their own names are forgot,  
And men must doubt if they e’er lived or not.

   "Glorious my lover was unto my sight,  
Most beautiful,—of love we grew so fain  
That we at last agreed, that on a night  
We should be happy, but that he were slain  
Or shut in hold, and neither joy nor pain  
Should else forbid that hoped-for time to be;  
So came the night that made a wretch of me.

   "Ah! well do I remember all that night,  
When through the window shone the orb of June,  
And by the bed flickered the taper's light,  
Whereby I trembled, gazing at the moon:  
Ah me! the meeting that we had, when soon  
Into his strong, well-trusted anus I fell,  
And many a sorrow we began to tell.

   "Ah me! what parting on that night we had!  
I think the story of my great despair  
A little while might merry folk make sad;  
For, as he swept away my yellow hair—  
To make my shoulder and my bosom bare,  
I raised mine eyes, and shuddering could behold  
A shadow cast upon the bed of gold: <span id="page_519">p. 519</span>

   "Then suddenly was quenched my hot desire  
And he untwined his arms; the moon so pale  
A while ago, seemed changed to blood and fire,  
And yet my limbs beneath me did not fail,  
And neither had I strength to cry or wail,  
But stood there helpless, bare, and shivering,  
With staring eyes still fixed upon the thing.

   "Because the shade that on the bed of gold  
The changed and dreadful moon was throwing down  
Was of Diana, whom I did behold,  
With knotted hair, and shining girt-up gown,  
And on the high white brow, a deadly frown  
Bent upon us, who stood scarce drawing breath,  
Striving to meet the horrible sure death,

   "No word at all the dreadful goddess said,  
But soon across my feet my lover lay,  
And well indeed I knew that he was dead;  
And would that I had died on that same day!  
For in a while the image turned away,  
And without words my doom I understood,  
And felt a horror change my natural blood.

   "And there I fell, and on the floor I lay  
By the dead man, till daylight came on me,  
And not a word thenceforward could I say  
For three years, till of grief and misery,  
The lingering pest, the cruel enemy, <span id="page_520">p. 520</span>  
My father and his folk were dead and gone,  
And in this castle I was left alone:

   "And then the doom foreseen upon me fell  
For Queen Diana did my body change  
Into a fork-tongued dragon flesh and fell,  
And through the island nightly do I range,  
Or in the green sea mate with monsters strange,  
When in the middle of the moonlit night  
The sleepy mariner I do afright.

   "But all day long upon this gold I lie  
Within this place, where never mason's hand  
Smote trowel on the marble noisily;  
Drowsy I lie, no folk at my command,  
Who once was called the Lady of the Land;  
Who might have bought a kingdom with a kiss,  
Yea, half the world with such a sight as this."

   And therewithal, with rosy fingers light,  
Backward her heavy-hanging hair she threw,  
To give her naked beauty more to sight;  
But when, forgetting all the things he knew,  
Maddened with love unto the prize he drew,  
She cried, "Nay, wait! for wherefore wilt thou die,  
Why should we not be happy, thou and I?

   "Wilt thou not save me? once in every year  
This rightful form of mine that thou dost see <span id="page_521">p.
521</span>  
By favour of the goddess have I here  
From sunrise unto sunset given me,  
That some brave man may end my misery.  
And thou—art thou not brave? can thy heart fail,  
Whose eyes e’en now are weeping at my tale?

   "Then listen! when this day is overpast,  
A fearful monster shall I be again,  
And thou mayst be my saviour at the last,  
Unless, once more, thy words are nought and vain;  
If thou of love and sovereignty art fain,  
Come thou next morn, and when thou seest here  
A hideous dragon, have thereof no fear,

   "But take the loathsome head up in thine hands,  
And kiss it, and be master presently  
Of twice the wealth that is in all the lands,  
From Cathay to the head of Italy;  
And master also, if it pleaseth thee,  
Of all thou praisest as so fresh and bright,  
Of what thou callest crown of all delight.

   "Ah! with what joy then shall I see again  
The sunlight on the green grass and the trees,  
And hear the clatter of the summer rain,  
And see the joyous folk beyond the seas.  
Ah, me! to hold my child upon my knees,  
After the weeping of unkindly tears,  
And all the wrongs of these four hundred years. <span id="page_522">p.
522</span>

   "Go now, go quick! leave this grey heap of stone;  
And from thy glad heart think upon thy way,  
How I shall love thee—yea, love thee alone,  
That bringest me from dark death unto day;  
For this shall be thy wages and thy pay;  
Unheard-of wealth, unheard-of love is near,  
If thou hast heart a little dread to bear."

   Therewith she turned to go; but he cried out,  
"Ah! wilt thou leave me then without one kiss,  
To slay the very seeds of doubt and fear,  
That glad to-morrow may bring certain bliss?  
Hast thou forgotten how love lives by this,  
The memory of some hopeful close embrace,  
Low whispered words within some lonely place?"

   But she, when his bright glittering eyes she saw,  
And burning cheeks, cried out, "Alas, alas!  
Must I be quite undone, and wilt thou draw  
A worse fate on me than the first one was?  
O haste thee from this fatal place to pass!  
Yet, ere thou goest, take this, lest thou shouldst deem  
Thou hast been fooled by some strange midday dream.

   So saying, blushing like a new-kissed maid,  
From off her neck a little gem she drew,  
That, ’twixt those snowy rose-tinged hillocks laid,  
The secrets of her glorious beauty knew;  
And ere he well perceived what she would do, <span id="page_523">p.
523</span>  
She touched his hand, the gem within it lay,  
And, turning, from his sight she fled away.

   Then at the doorway where her rosy heel  
Had glanced and vanished, he awhile did stare,  
And still upon his hand he seemed to feel  
The varying kisses of her fingers fair;  
Then turned he toward the dreary crypt and bare,  
And dizzily throughout the castle passed,  
Till by the ruined fane he stood at last.

   Then weighing still the gem within his hand,  
He stumbled backward though the cypress wood,  
Thinking the while of some strange lovely land,  
Where all his life should be most fair and good;  
Till on the valley's wall of hills he stood,  
And slowly thence passed down unto the bay  
Red with the death of that bewildering day.

 

 

THE next day came, and he, who all the night  
Had ceaselessly been turning in his bed,  
Arose and clad himself in armour bright,  
And many a danger he remembered;  
Storming of towns, lone sieges full of dread,  
That with renown his heart had borne him through,  
And this thing seemed a little thing to do. <span id="page_524">p.
524</span>

   So on he went, and on the way he thought  
Of all the glorious things of yesterday,  
Nought of the price whereat they must be bought,  
But ever to himself did softly say,  
"No roaming now, my wars are passed away,  
No long dull days devoid of happiness,  
When such a love my yearning heart shall bless."

   Thus to the castle did he come at last,  
But when unto the gateway he drew near,  
And underneath its ruined archway passed  
Into the court, a strange noise did he hear,  
And through his heart there shot a pang of fear,  
Trembling, he gat his sword into his hand,  
And midmost of the cloisters took his stand.

   But for a while that unknown noise increased  
A rattling, that with strident roars did blend,  
And whining moans; but suddenly it ceased,  
A fearful thing stood at the cloister's end,  
And eyed him for a while, then gan to wend  
Adown the cloisters, and began again  
That rattling, and the moan like fiends in pain.

   And as it came on towards him, with its teeth  
The body of a slain goat did it tear,  
The blood whereof in its hot jaws did seethe,  
And on its tongue he saw the smoking hair;  
Then his heart sank, and standing trembling there, <span
id="page_525">p. 525</span>  
Throughout his mind wild thoughts and fearful ran,  
"Some fiend she was," he said, "the bane of man."

   Yet he abode her still, although his blood  
Curdled within him: the thing dropped the goat,  
And creeping on, came close to where he stood,  
And raised its head to him, and wrinkled throat,  
Then he cried out and wildly at her smote,  
Shutting his eyes, and turned and from the place  
Ran swiftly, with a white and ghastly face.

   But little things rough stones and tree-trunks seemed,  
And if he fell, he rose and ran on still;  
No more he felt his hurts than if he dreamed,  
He made no stay for valley or steep hill,  
Heedless he dashed through many a foaming rill,  
Until he came unto the ship at last  
And with no word into the deep hold passed.

   Meanwhile the dragon, seeing him clean gone,  
Followed him not, but crying horribly,  
Caught up within her jaws a block of stone  
And ground it into powder, then turned she,  
With cries that folk could hear far out at sea,  
And reached the treasure set apart of old,  
To brood above the hidden heaps of gold.

   Yet was she seen again on many a day  
By some half-waking mariner, or herd, <span id="page_526">p.
526</span>  
Playing amid the ripples of the bay,  
Or on the hills making all things afeard,  
Or in the wood, that did that castle gird,  
But never any man again durst go  
To seek her woman's form, and end her woe.

   As for the man, who knows what things he bore?  
What mournful faces peopled the sad night,  
What wailings vexed him with reproaches sore,  
What images of that nigh-gained delight!  
What dreamed caresses from soft hands and white,  
Turning to horrors ere they reached the best,  
What struggles vain, what shame, what huge unrest?

   No man he knew, three days he lay and raved,  
And cried for death, until a lethargy  
Fell on him, and his fellows thought him saved;  
But on the third day he awoke to die;  
And at Byzantium doth his body lie  
Between two blossoming pomegranate trees,  
Within the churchyard of the Genoese.

 

<span id="page_527">p. 527</span>

A MOMENT'S silence as his tale had end,  
And then the wind of that June night did blend  
Their varied voices, as of that and this  
They fell to talk: of those fair islands' bliss  
They knew in other days, of hope they had  
To live there long an easy life and glad,  
With nought to vex them; and the younger men  
Began to nourish strange dreams even then  
Of sailing east, as these had once sailed west;  
Because the story of that luckless quest  
With hope, not fear, had filled their joyous hearts  
And made them dream of new and noble parts  
That they might act; of raising up the name  
Their fathers bore, and winning boundless fame.  
   These too with little patience seemed to hear,  
That story end with shame and grief and fear;  
A little thing the man had had to do,  
They said, if longing burned within him so.  
But at their words the older men must bow  
Their heads, and, smiling, somewhat thoughtful grow,  
Remembering well how fear in days gone by  
Had dealt with them, and poisoned wretchedly  
Good days, good deeds, and longings for all good:  
Yet on the evil times they would not brood,  
But sighing, strove to raise the weight of years,  
And no more memory of their hopes and fears  
They nourished, but such gentle thoughts as fed  
The pensiveness the lovely season bred.
