<p align="center"><i>Kiartan weds Refna</i>.</p>  
<p>I THINK that Gudrun on the morrow morn<br> Deemed herself yet more wretched and forlorn<br> Than e&#146;er before; I deem that Kiartan woke<br> And found it harder yet to bear the yoke<br> Than in past days&#151;their eyes had met at last,<br> No look of anger from them had been cast<br> Sweet words might take away; no look of woe<br> A touch might turn to pleasure, none can know<br> But those who know the torturer Love, the bliss<br> That heals the stripes those bear who still are his.<br> Who knows what tale had been to tell, if she<br> Had met his first proud look all tearfully,<br> With weak imploring looks? Ah, sore she yearned<br> To cry aloud the things that in her burned,<br> To cast aside all fear and shame, and kneel<br> Before his feet, so she his lips might feel<br> Once more as in the old days; but, alas!<br> A wall of shame and wrong betwixt them was,<br> Nor could the past deeds ever be undone.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes it might be when they were alone<br> In quiet times&#151;in evening twilight, when <A NAME="page_448"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 448</FONT></A><br> Far off and softened came the voice of men;<br> Or, better yet, the murmur of the sea<br> Smote on the hearts of either peacefully,<br> Each to each kind would seem; until there came<br> The backward rush of pain and bitter blame<br> Unanswerable, cold, blighting, as the sea,<br> Let in o&#146;er flowers&#151;'Why didst thou so to me,<br> To me of all the world? while others strove<br> We looked to hold the sweetness of our love.<br> Yea, if earth failed beneath our feet&#151;and now<br> How is the sweet turned bitter!&#151;yea, and thou<br> Art just so nigh to me, that still thou art<br> A restless anguish to my craving heart.'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take note too midst all this, that Gudrun heard<br> Rumoured about this added bitter word,<br> That Refna, Asgeir's daughter, looked to wear<br> The coif the Norway queen had meant for her,<br> When Kiartan left that broken heart behind;<br> For that tale too her hungry ears must find.<br> Then would she clean forget all other woe,<br> In thinking how she dreamed the days would go,<br> That while she waited doubting nought of him;<br> Then would the past and future wax all dim<br> In brooding o&#146;er that unaccomplished bliss,<br> In moaning to herself, &#146;twixt kiss and kiss<br> The things she would have said, in picturing,<br> As in the hopeful time, how arms would cling<br> About her, and sweet eyes, unsatisfied <A NAME="page_449"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 449</FONT></A><br> E&#146;en with the fullness of all bliss, would hide<br> No love from her&#151;and she forgot those eyes<br> What they were now, all dulled with miseries;<br> And she forgot the sorrow of the heart<br> That fate and time from hers had thrust apart.<br> Still wrong bred wrong within her, day by day<br> Some little speck of kindness fell away,<br> Till in her heart naked desire alone<br> Was left, the one thing not to be undone.<br> Then would the jealous flame in such wise burn<br> Within her, that to Bodli would she turn,<br> And madden him with fond caressing touch<br> And tender word; and he, worn overmuch<br> With useless striving, still his heart would blind,<br> Unto the dread awaking he should find.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubt not, that of this too had Kiartan heard,<br> If nought but idle babbling men had stirred,<br> But more there was; for the fierce-hearted fools,<br> The sons of Oswif, made these twain their tools<br> To satisfy their envious hate; for they<br> Waxed eviller-hearted as day followed day,<br> Grudging the Peacock's house its luck and fame;<br> And when into their household Bodli came,<br> In such wise as ye know, with hate and scorn,<br> Which still they had, of his grave face and worn,<br> A joy began to mingle presently,<br> A thought that they through him might get to see<br> Herdholt beneath their feet in grief and shame;<A NAME="page_450"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 450</FONT></A><br> So cunningly they turned them to the game<br> As such men will, and scattered wide the seeds,<br> Lies, and words half-true, of the bitterest deeds.<br> For doubt not, kindly-natured though he were,<br> That Kiartan too was changing: who would hear<br> Such things as once he heard, from one who went<br> &#146;Twixt the two houses, with no ill intent,<br> But blabbing and a fool, well stuffed with lies,<br> At Ospak's hands&#151;for in most loving wise<br> The new-wed folk lived now, he said; soon too<br> He deemed would Bodli draw to him a crew,<br> And take ship for the southlands: "Nought at all<br> Was talked of last night in the Bathstead hall,<br> But about England and King Ethelred."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, and was Gudrun merry?" Haldor said,<br> Yet stammered saying it, &#146;neath Kiartan's frown,<br> Who cleared his brow though, nor e&#146;en looked adown<br> As the man answered, smiling, pleased to show<br> That he somewhat of great folk's minds did know:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea, many, was she merry. Good cause why,<br> For she will go with Bodli certainly,<br> And win such fame as women love to do;<br> Ye well may wot he saith no nay thereto,<br> If she but ask him; they sat hand in hand<br> As if no folk were left in all the land<br> Except themselves."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stayed his talk hereat, <A NAME="page_451"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 451</FONT></A><br> For men looked strangely on him as he sat<br> Smiling and careless, casting words that bit<br> Like poisoned darts: no less did Kiartan sit<br> With unchanged face, nor rose to go away,<br> Yea, even strove within himself to say:<br> 'Good luck go with them! mine she cannot be,<br> May she be happy, here, or over sea!<br> Why should I wish aught ill on them to fall.'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, indeed, a flood of bitterest gall<br> Swept o&#146;er his heart; despite himself he thought:<br> 'So now, to lonely ways behold me brought,<br> She will not miss me more&#151;so change the days,<br> And Bodli's loving looks and Bodli's praise<br> Shall be enough for her. I am alone,<br> And ne&#146;er shall be aught else&#151;would I were gone<br> From where none need me now&#151;belike my fame<br> Shall be forgotten, wrapped in Bodli's name,<br> E&#146;en as my kisses on the lips, that once<br> Trembled with longing through the change of suns&#151;<br> Those years in Norway shall be blotted out<br> From song and story&#151;yea, or men shall doubt<br> If I or Bodli there that praise did win&#151;<br> What say I, for I deem that men begin<br> To doubt if e&#146;er I loved my love at all!'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So thought he, mid the clamour of the hall,<br> Where few men knew his heart, but rather thought<br> That he began now somewhat to be brought <A NAME="page_452"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 452</FONT></A><br> From out his gloom; withal, time wore away,<br> And certainly as day comes after day,<br> So change comes after change in minds of men;<br> So otherwise he &#146;gan to be, than when<br> In early days his pain, nigh cherished, clung<br> Unto his wounded heart; belike it stung<br> Bitterer at whiles, now that he knew his life,<br> And hardened him to meet the lingering strife<br> &#146;Gainst the cold world that would not think of him<br> Too much. The kindness of old days waxed dim<br> Within his heart; he hearkened when men spake<br> Hard things about his love, for whose dear sake<br> Had fame once seemed so light a thing to win.<br> A blacker deed now seemed his fellow's sin<br> When lesser seemed the prize that it did gain;<br> Little by little from his bitter pain<br> Fell off the softening veil of tenderness;<br> Moody and brooding was he none the less,<br> And all the world, with all its good and ill,<br> Seemed nothing meet to move his sluggish will.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now a whole long year had passed, since he<br> Stood wildered by the borders of the sea<br> &#146;Neath his first sorrow. Herdholt late had seen<br> A noble feast, and thereat had there been<br> Among the guests Refna, the tender maid;<br> Gentle of mood, and pale, with head down-weighed<br> She sat amidst the feast; and Kiartan saw<br> That much she changed as he anigh did draw,<br> That her eyes brightened, and a sprightlier grace <A NAME="page_453"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 453</FONT></A><br> Came o&#146;er her lips, and colour lit her face.<br> And so when all the guests therefrom were gone,<br> Thurid, his sister, sat with him alone<br> Close upon sunset; thoughtful now was she,<br> He gayer than it was his wont to be,<br> And many things he spake to her; at last<br> The absent look from off her face she cast,<br> For she had listened little; and she said;<br> "Yea, brother, is she not a lovesome maid?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He started, "Who?" he said, "I noted not."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled, "Nay, then is beauty soon forgot;<br> Yet if I were a man, not old or wise,<br> Methinks I should remember wide grey eyes,<br> Lips like a scarlet thread, skin lily-white,<br> Round chin, smooth brow &#146;neath the dark hair's delight,<br> Fair neck, slim hands, and dainty limbs, well hid,<br> Since unto most of men doth fate forbid<br> To hold them as their own."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dark cloud spread<br> O&#146;er Kiartan's face: "Sister, forbear," he said;<br> "I am no lover, unto me but nought<br> Are these things grown."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nigher her face she brought<br> To his, and said: "And yet were I a man,<br> And noted how the love of me began<br> To move within the heart of such a maid<br> As Refna is, not soon her face would fade<br> From out my memory." <A NAME="page_454"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 454</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, nay, thou sayst<br> Fools&#146; words," he said, "and every word dost waste;<br> Who shall love broken men like unto me?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therewithal he sprang up angrily<br> And would be gone: she stayed him: "Were it so<br> That over well she loved; what wouldst thou do?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What should I do?" he said; "I have no heart<br> To give away, let her e&#146;en act my part<br> And find the days right dreary, yet live on."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Methinks," she said, "the end will soon be won<br> For her, poor maid! surely she waneth fast."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Thurid sighed withal; but Kiartan passed<br> Swiftly away from her: and yet he went<br> Unto his bed that night less ill content,<br> And ere he slept, of Ingibiorg he thought,<br> And all the pleasure her sweet love had brought<br> While he was with her; and this maid did seem<br> Like her come back amidst a happy dream.<br> The next morn came, and through his dreariness<br> A sweet thought somewhat did his heart caress;<br> Howe&#146;er he put it from him, back it came<br> Until it gathered shape, and took the name<br> Of pity, and seemed worthy to be nursed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So wore the days, and life seemed not so cursed <A NAME="page_455"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 455</FONT></A><br> With this to think of&#151;this so set apart<br> From all the misery that wrung his heart;<br> Until the sweet ruth grew, until he deemed<br> That yet perchance her love was only dreamed,<br> That she was heart-whole, yea, or loved indeed<br> But for another man was in such need:<br> And at that thought blank grew the world again,<br> And his old pain was shot across with pain<br> As woof hides warp. Ah, well! what will you have?<br> This was a man some shreds of joy to save<br> From out the wreck, if so he might, to win<br> Some garden from the waste, and dwell therein.<br> And yet he lingered long, or e&#146;er he told<br> His heart that it another name might hold<br> With that of the lost Gudrun. Time and sight<br> Made Refna's love clear as the noonday light;<br> Yea, nowise hard it was for him to think<br> That she without this joy would quickly sink<br> Into death's arms&#151;and she, she to fade thus<br> God's latest marvel! eyes so piteous<br> With such sweet longing, midst her beauty rare,<br> As though they said, 'Nought worthy thee is here,<br> Yet help me if thou canst: yet, if I die,<br> Like sweet embalmment round my heart shall lie<br> This love, this love, this love I have for thee;<br> Look once again before thou leavest me!'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She died not wholly joyless; they were wed,<br> When twenty changing moons their light had shed <A NAME="page_456"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 456</FONT></A><br> On the dark waves of Burgfirth, since in trust<br> Of Gudrun's love, over the bridge new thrust<br> From out the ship, the much-praised Kiartan ran.<br> So strangely shift men's lives in little span.</p>
