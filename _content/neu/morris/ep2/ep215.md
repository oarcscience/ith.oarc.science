*Kiartan's Farewell to Norway*.

MEANWHILE to Kiartan far across the sea,  
Unto all seeming, life went merrily;  
Yet none the less the lapse of days would bring  
Unto his frank heart something of a sting,  
And Bodli's sad departing face and word,  
Not wholly thrust out from his memory, stirred  
Doubts of the changing days in Kiartan's mind,  
And scarce amid his joyance might he find  
The happy days he ever looked to have,  
Till he were lying silent in his grave.  
And somewhat more distraught now would he take  
The gentle words that the king's sister spake,  
And look into her eyes less fervently,  
And less forget the world when she drew nigh,  
And start and look around as her soft hand  
Fell upon his, as though a ghost did stand  
Anigh him, and he feared to hear it speak.  
   And Ingibiorg for her part, grown too weak <span id="page_419">p.
419</span>  
Against the love she had for him to strive,  
Yet knew no less whither the days did drive  
Her wasted life; and, seeing him as oft  
As she might do, and speaking sweet and soft,  
When they twain were together: smiling, too,  
Though fast away the lovesome time did go,  
Wept long through lonely hours, nor cast away  
From out her heart thought of the coming day,  
When all should be as it had never been,  
And the wild sea should roll its waves between  
His grey eyes and her weary useless tears.

   But while she brooded o’er the coming years  
Empty of love, and snatched what joy there was  
Yet left to her, great tidings came to pass;  
For late the summer after Bodli sailed,  
News came, that now at last had Christ prevailed  
In Iceland; that the Hill of Laws had heard  
Sung through the clear air many a threatening word,  
And seen the weapons gather for the fight;  
Till Snorri's wiles, Hall's wisdom, Gizur's might,  
And fears of many men, and wavering doubt  
On the worse side, had brought it so about  
That now Christ's faith was law to everyone:  
The learned say, a thousand years agone  
Since the cold shepherds in the winter night  
Beheld and heard the angels’ fresh delight.  
   King Olaf's heart swelled at such news as these,  
Straightway he sent for the four hostages, <span id="page_420">p.
420</span>  
And bade them with good gifts to go their ways  
If so they would; or stay and gather praise  
And plenteous honour there; and as he spake  
He glanced at Kiartan, and a smile did break  
Across his kingly face, as who would say,  
"Thou at the least wilt scarcely go away."  
But Kiartan answered not the smile, but stood  
Grave with deep thought, and troubled in his mood,  
Until he saw his fellows looked that he  
Should speak for all; then said he presently:

   "Thanks have thou, King, for all that thou hast done  
To us, and the great honour I have won  
At thine hands here; yet be not angry, King,  
If still we thank thee most for this one thing,  
That here thou stay’st us not against our will;  
Thicker is blood than water, say I still;  
This is the third year since I left my kin  
And land—and other things that dwell therein."

   The king's face fell, and in sharp words and few  
He answered: "Well, a gift I gave to you;  
And will not take it back—Go, Kiartan, then,  
And, if thou canst, find kinder, truer men,  
And lovelier maids in thy land than in this!"

   But Kiartan said, "King, take it not amiss!  
Thou knowest I have ever said to thee,  
That I must one day go across the sea;  
Belike I shall come back upon a tide, <span id="page_421">p.
421</span>  
And show thee such a wonder of a bride  
As earth holds not, nay nor the heavens, I deem."

   "God send thee a good ending to thy dream;  
Yet my heart cries that if thou goest from me,  
Thy pleasant face I never more shall see;  
Be merry then, while fate will have it so!"

   So therewith unto high feast did they go,  
And by the king sat Kiartan, and the day  
’Twixt merry words and sad thoughts wore away.

   Now were the ships got ready, and the wares  
Drawn for long months past from the upland fairs  
Were laid ashipboard. Kálf was skipper still  
Of Kiartan's ship, for never had he will  
To leave his side. Now restless Kiartan was,  
And longed full sore for these last days to pass,  
For in his heart there lurked a spark of fear,  
Nor any word of Gudrun might he hear  
From those who brought the news of change of faith,  
Since nigh the fleet they dwelt, my story saith,  
In the south country, and knew nought at all  
Of what in Laxdale late had chanced to fall.

   Now by their bridges lay the laden ships,  
And he now at the last must see the lips  
Of Ingibiorg grow pale with their farewell;  
And sick at heart he grew, for, sooth to tell,  
He feared her sorrow much, and furthermore <span id="page_422">p.
422</span>  
He loved her with a strange love very sore,  
Despite the past and future. So he went  
Sad-eyed amid the hall's loud merriment  
Unto her bower on that last morn of all.  
   Alone she was, her head against the wall  
Had fallen; her heavy eyes were shut when he  
Stood on the threshold; she rose quietly,  
Hearing the clash of arms, and took his hand,  
And thus with quivering lips awhile did stand  
Regarding him: but he made little show  
Of manliness, but let the hot tears flow  
Fast o’er his cheeks. At last she spake:  
                                       "Weep then!  
If thou who art the kindest of all men  
Must sorrow for me, yet more glad were I  
To see thee leave my bower joyfully  
This last time; that when o’er thee sorrow came,  
And thought of me therewith, thou mightst not blame  
My little love for ever saddening thee.  
Love!—let me say love once—great shalt thou be,  
Beloved of all, and dying ne’er forgot.  
Farewell! farewell! farewell! and think thou not  
That in my heart there lingers any hate  
Of her who through these years for thee did wait,  
A weary waiting—three long, long, long years,  
Well over now; nay when of me she hears,  
Fain were I she should hate me not. Behold,  
Here is a coif, well wrought of silk and gold <span id="page_423">p.
423</span>  
By folk of Micklegarth, who had no thought  
Of thee or me, and thence by merchants brought  
Who perchance loved not. Is Gudrun too fair  
To take this thing, a queen might long to wear?  
Upon the day when on the bench ye sit,  
Hand held in hand, crown her fair head with it,  
And tell her whence thou hadst it. Ah, farewell,  
Lest of mine eyes thou shouldst have worse to tell  
Than now thou hast!"  
                       Therewith she turned from him  
And took the coif, wherein the gold was dim  
With changing silken threads, the linen white  
Scarce seen amid the silk and gold delight.  
With hands that trembled little did she fold  
The precious thing, and set its weight of gold  
Within a silken bag; and then to his  
She reached her hands, and in one bitter kiss  
Tasted his tears, while a great wave of thought  
Of what sweet things the changed years might have brought  
Swept over her—and then she knew him gone,  
And yet for all that scarcely felt more lone  
Than for a many days past she had felt.  
So with fixed eyes she drew into her belt  
Her kirtle, and to this and that thing turned  
With heart that ever for the long rest yearned.

   Bearing that gift, but heeding not what thing  
He had with him, came Kiartan to the king, <span id="page_424">p.
424</span>  
Who in the porch abode him, his great men  
Standing around; then said he:  
                                "Welcome then  
This last day that I see thee; go we forth,  
Fair lords, and see his ship's head greet the north,  
For seldom from the north shall any come  
Like unto him to greet us in our home."

   So forth they went, and all the Iceland men  
Gat them aboard, and skipper Kálf by then  
Stood midway on the last bridge, while the king  
’Gan say to Kiartan:  
                           "Many a treasured thing  
Had I laid down, O friend, to keep thee here,  
But since the old thing still must be more dear  
Than the new thing, to such men as thou art,  
Now, with my goodwill, to thy love depart,  
And leave me here the coming woes to meet  
Without thee. May thy life be fair and sweet,  
Nor yet drag on till present days are nought,  
And all the past days a tormenting thought!  
Take this last gift of me; a noble sword,  
Which if thou dost according to my word,  
Shall never leave thy side; for who can know  
Ere all is o’er, how madly things may go?"

   So Kiartan took the sword, and thanked the king,  
With no light heart, for that and everything  
That at his hands he had, and therewith crossed <span id="page_425">p.
425</span>  
The gangway; shoreward were the hawsers tossed,  
The long sweeps smote the water, and the crew  
Shouted their last farewell; the white sail drew,  
’Twixt Norway and the stern, swept in the sea.

   There stood the king, and long time earnestly  
Looked on the lessening ship; then said at last,  
As o’er his knitted brow his hand he passed:  
"Go thy ways, Kiartan; great thou art indeed,  
And great thy kin are, nathless shalt thou need  
Stout heart enough to meet what waiteth thee  
If aught mine eyes of things to come may see."
