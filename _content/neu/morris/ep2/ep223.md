*Thorhalla tells of Kiartan's Comings and Goings*.

WHAT should the next move in the strange game be?  
Kiartan rode through the country carelessly  
With few behind him, but nought hitherto  
The sons of Oswif durst against him do,  
While he his hand withheld not utterly  
From them; so doubtful did the days go by.

   And Gudrun? Ah, the black spot in her heart  
That rose when first she knew that one had part  
In Kiartan's life, and ever greater grew,  
When of his love toward this new love she knew,  
Now at he last, when over sure she felt  
That she no longer in his memory dwelt,  
O’erspread her life, till from the foiled desire  
Cast back upon her heart, there sprang a fire  
Of very hate: true was it, that at first  
Bodli, herself, and all around she cursed  
Rather than Kiartan—Well, what will you have  
That was ere hope had sunk into his grave, <span id="page_488">p.
488</span>  
While yet some pleasure clung round Kiartan's name.  
Then came the feast at Herdholt; then the shame  
About the coif, and fear of shame again,  
And many a tale told to make over plain  
His love for Refna; then the evil hour,  
When she within the darksome hall must cower  
Among her trembling brethren: then, when she  
Had looked at least a noble death to see,  
Of one who loved her, Kiartan sent him back  
A baffled man, as who all might did lack,  
Yea, even the might to die; still, at each turn  
Afresh this weary lesson must she learn;  
With the wrong-doers hast thou taken part,  
Live then, and die with them, for thy love's heart  
Is now no more for thee! still everywhere  
Did Kiartan's image meet her; the warm air  
Of summer seemed but sent her from his hand,  
The sea that beat the borders of the land  
Still seemed to bear his fame unto her feet;  
All summer sights and sounds, and odours sweet,  
Were heavy with his memory: no least way  
To ’scape from thought of him from day to day.  
Withal, the sight of faces dull with hate  
Of that same man, on every step did wait.  
Familiar grew the muttering sullen voice  
Of those who in no goodhap could rejoice,  
Until the very thought and hope of strife,  
The use of hate, must grow to be her life.  
And shaped therefrom a dreadful longing rose, <span id="page_489">p.
489</span>  
That some fell end the weary way would close,  
Unto herself she scarce durst whisper what.

   Now on a day three of her brothers sat  
Within the hall, and talked, and she stood by  
Hearkening their eager speech most wearily.  
"The gabbling crone Thorhalla has just been,"  
Said Ospak, "And whom think you she has seen?"

   "Nay, by thy scowl I know well," Thorolf said,  
"’Twas Kiartan Olafson, upon my head."

   "Well, Thorolf, thou grow’st wise—now, said the crone,  
That in her life she ne’er saw such an one  
As Kiartan looked, a loving maiden's dream  
Of a great king, she said, the man did seem.  
'Well,' said I, 'and how long then will it last?'  
'Ah,' said the crone, 'till after ye are passed;  
Why, the whole country-side is ringing now  
With this, that ye had best be wise and bow  
Before him humbly, since most kind is he;  
Kind,' says the crone, 'certes he was to me.'  
'Well, well,' says I, 'but these are fools’ words here.'  
'Nay, let me speak,' she says, 'for he will fare  
Unto the west to Knoll; this know I well,  
Because to him therewith I needs must tell  
Of one who owed me half a mark thereby. <span id="page_490">p.
490</span>  
Well, goody, says he, I shall pass anigh,  
And I will fetch it for thee—lo, how kind.'"

   "Now may God strike the gabbling idiot blind!"  
Said Thorolf. "Nay," said Ospak, "not so wise  
Thou growest now; rather, God keep her eyes!  
Tidings she told me, saying he would bide  
For just three days at Knoll, and thence will ride  
Through Swinedale home, close here, nor like that he  
Will ride by us with a great company,  
Say two at most—good luck go with his pride,  
Whereby so fair a chance doth us betide!—  
Bodli shall lead or die."  
                           Then Gudrun turned  
Sick-hearted from them; how her longing burned  
Within her heart! ah, if he died not now,  
How might she tell whereto his hate would grow?  
Yet a strange hope that longing shot across,  
As she got thinking what would be the loss  
If Bodli fell ’neath Kiartan's hand. That day,  
Like years long told, past Gudrun wore away,  
She knew not how; but when the next day came  
She cried aloud, "The same, ah, still the same,  
Shall every day be, now that he is dead!"  
She started as she heard her voice, her head  
Seemed filled with flame: she crawled unto her bower  
And at her mirrored face hour after hour  
She stared, and wondered what she really was,  
The once-loved thing o’er which his lips would pass. <span
id="page_491">p. 491</span>  
Her feet grew heavy at the end of day,  
Her heart grew faint, upon her bed she lay  
Moveless for many an hour, until the sun  
Told her that now the last day was begun;  
Then she arose as one might in a dream  
To clothe herself, till a great cloud did seem  
To draw away from her; as in bright hell,  
Sunless but shadowless she saw full well  
Her life that was and would be, now she knew  
The deed unmasked that summer day should do.  
And then she gnashed her teeth and tore her hair,  
And beat her breast, nor lightened thus despair,  
As over and over the sweet names she told  
Whereby he called her in the days of old;  
And then she thought of Refna's longing eyes,  
And to her face a dreadful smile did rise  
That died amidst its birth, as back again  
Her thoughts went to the tender longing pain  
She once had deemed a sweet fair day would end;  
And therewith such an agony did rend  
Her body and soul, that all things she forgat  
Amidst of it; upon the bed she sat  
Rigid and stark, and deemed she shrieked, yet made  
No sound indeed; but slowly now did fade  
All will away from her, until the sun  
Risen higher, on her moveless body shone,  
And as a smitten thing beneath its stroke  
She shrank and started, and awhile awoke  
To hear the tramp of men about the hall. <span id="page_492">p.
492</span>  
Then did a hand upon the panel fall;  
And in her very soul she heard the ring  
Of weapons pulled adown, and every thing,  
Yea, even pain, was dead a little space.

   At last she woke to see the haggard face  
Of Bodli o’er her own: "I go," he said,  
"Would God that thou mayst hear of me as dead  
Ere the sun sets to-day."  
                           She passed her hand  
Across her eyes, as he in arms did stand  
Before her there, and stared but answered not,  
As though indeed his face were clean forgot;  
Yet her face quickened as his eyes she saw  
So full of ruth yet nigher to her draw:  
She shrank aback, but therewith suddenly  
A thought smote through her, with an angry cry  
She sprang up from the bed, naked and white  
Her gold hair glittering in the sunshine bright  
That flooded all the place; his arm she caught  
And stared into his eyes:  
                            "What is thy thought?"  
She said, "why goest thou with these murderous men?  
Ah! dost thou think thou yet mayst save him then?  
Ah! dost thou think that thou mayst still be kind  
To every one, fool as thou art and blind,  
Yet work thy wicked will to pleasure thee?"

   Across her passion he began to see <span id="page_493">p.
493</span>  
That now she doubted him; he muttered low:  
"The work of these my hands what man can know?  
And yet at least the end shall be to-day."

   She fell aback nor noted more, but lay  
All huddled up upon the bed, her hair  
O’er her white body scattered here and there,  
And as he gazed on her he saw she wept,  
And a wild passion o’er his heart there swept,  
And twice he stretched his arms out, to embrace  
His curse and his delight, twice turned his face  
Unto the door that led unto the hall,  
Then with a cry upon her did he fall  
And, sobbing, strained her to his mail-clad breast,  
And to her writhen lips his lips he pressed,  
And moaned o’er her wet cheeks, and kissed her eyes  
That knew him not; till in his heart ’gan rise,  
Now at the last, a glory in his shame,  
A pride to take the whole world's bitter blame;  
And like a god he felt, though well he deemed  
That to an end at last his dream was dreamed.  
And she, she knew him not, her arms fell down  
Away from him, her drawn mouth and set frown  
Were not for him, she did not shrink from him,  
She turned not round to curse or bless, when dim  
She lay before his burning eyes once more,  
Her long hair gilding the white bed-clothes o’er,  
As midst low restless moaning there she tossed.  
   Wildly he cried: "Oh, Gudrun, thou hast lost, <span id="page_494">p.
494</span>  
But look on me for I have never won!"  
Then from the place he rushed, and with the sun  
Burst into the dusk hall, a stream of light,  
Neath his dark hair, his face so strange and white  
That a dead man dragged up into the day  
By wizard's arts he seemed to be, and they  
Who waited armed there, and the last cup drank  
Looked each at each, and from his presence shrank.

   For there were gathered now the murderous band,  
Long to be cursed thereafter through the land,  
Gudrun's five brethren, and three stout men more.  
Then Ospak cried, "Soon shall our shame be o’er,  
And thou and we shall be great men and famed,  
And Bathstead free; come now, since thou art named  
Our leader, husband of Gudrun, lead forth!  
For this day shall be called a day of worth,  
By those that tell the story of our house."

   Flushed were the men, and fierce and boisterous,  
And Bodli trembled in his helpless rage  
To be among them, but his sin's strong cage  
Was strait and strong about him: with no word  
He girt to him the rover's deadly sword,  
And did his helm on: and so forth they wend  
Through the bright morn to bring about the end.
