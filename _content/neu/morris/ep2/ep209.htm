<p><A NAME="page_277"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 277</FONT></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE STORY OF RHODOPE.</h3>  <h4 align="center">ARGUMENT.</h4>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">THERE was in a poor land a certain maid, lowly but exceeding beautiful, who, by a strange hap, was drawn from her low estate, and became a queen and the world's wonder.</FONT></p>  
<p>A GRECIAN-SPEAKING folk there dwelt of yore,<br> Whose name my tale remembers not, between<br> The snow-topped mountains and the sea-beat shore,<br> Upon a strip of plain, and upland green,<br> Where seldom was the worst of summer seen,<br> And seldom the last bond of winter's cold;<br> Easy was life &#146;twixt garden, field, and fold.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My tale says these dealt little with the sea,<br> But for the mullet's flushed vermilion,<br> And weight o&#146; the tunny, and what things might be<br> Behind the snowy tops but moon and sun<br> They knew not, nor as yet had anyone<br> Sunk shaft in hill-side there, or dried the stream<br> To see if &#146;neath its sand gold specks might gleam. <A NAME="page_278"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 278</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet rich enow they were; deep-uddered kine<br> Went lowing towards the pails at eventide;<br> The sheep cropped close unto the well-fenced vine,<br> Whose clusters hung upon the southering side<br> Of the fair hill; the brown plain far and wide<br> Changed year by year through green to hoary gold,<br> And the unherded, moaning bees untold</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blind-eyed to aught but blossoms, ranged the land,<br> Working for others; and the clacking loom<br> Not long within the homestead still did stand;<br> The spindles twirled within the women's room,<br> And oft amidst the depth of winter's gloom,<br> From off the poplar-block white chips would fly<br> &#146;Neath some deft hand, watched of the standers-by.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes too would the foreign chapmen come,<br> And beach their dromond in the sandy bay,<br> And then the women-folk from many a home,<br> With heavy-laden beasts would take their way,<br> And round the black-keeled ship expend the day,<br> And by the moon would come back, light enow,<br> With things soon told, for that rough wealth to show.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore of delicate array, full oft<br> Small lack there was in coffers of that land,<br> And gold would shine on shoulders smooth and soft,<br> And sparklike gems glitter from many a hand,<br> And by the altar would the goodman stand <A NAME="page_279"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 279</FONT></A><br> Upon the solemn days of sacrifice,<br> Clad in attire of no such wretched price.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the next morn the yellow headed girls<br> Would be afield, or &#146;twixt the vine-rows green,<br> And on the goodman's forehead would no pearls,<br> But rather sundrawn beaded drops be seen,<br> As the bright share carved out the furrow clean,<br> Or the thick swath fell &#146;neath the sturdy stroke:<br> For all must labour midst that simple folk.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in a land where few were poor, if none<br> Were lordly rich, a certain man abode,<br> Who poorer was perchance than anyone<br> That ruled a house; yea, somewhat of a load<br> Of fears he bare adown life's latter road,<br> For, touching now upon his sixtieth year,<br> His wealth still waned, and still his house grew bare.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why this should be none knew, for he was deft<br> In all the simple craft of that fair land,<br> Plough-stilt, and spade, and sickle, and axe-heft,<br> As much as need be pressed his hardened hand,<br> And creeping wanhope still did he withstand;<br> Wedded he was, and his grey helpmate too<br> Was skilled in all, and ever wrought her due.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet did his goods decrease: at end of dry<br> He cut his hay, to lie long in the rain; <A NAME="page_280"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 280</FONT></A><br> And timorous must he let the time go by<br> For vintaging; and August came in vain<br> To his thin wheat; his sheep of wolves were slain;<br> Lame went his horses, barren were his kine,<br> His slaughtering-stock before the knife would pine.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this befell him more than most I say,<br> And yet he lived on; gifts were plenty there,<br> The rich man's wealth but seldom hoarded lay;<br> And at a close-fist would the people stare,<br> And point the finger as at something rare&#151;<br> Yet ever giving is a burden still,<br> And fast our goodman trundled down the hill.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not always though had fortune served him thus,<br> In earlier days rich had he been and great,<br> But had no chick or child to bless his house,<br> And much did it mislike him of his fate,<br> And early to the Gods he prayed and late,<br> To give him that if all they took besides,<br> As to fate's feet will blind men still be guides.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on a day when more than twenty years<br> Of childless wedlock had oppressed his wife,<br> She spake to him with smiles and happy tears;<br> And said, "Be glad, for ended is the strife<br> Betwixt us and the Gods, and our old life<br> Shall be renewed to us; the blossom clings<br> Unto the bough long barren, the waste sings." <A NAME="page_281"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 281</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joyful he was at those glad words, and went<br> A changed man through his homestead on that morn,<br> And on fair things stored up he stared intent,<br> And hugged himself on things he erst did scorn,<br> When life seemed quickly ended and forlorn.<br> And so the days passed, till the time was come<br> When a new voice should wail on its cold home.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March was it, but a foretaste of the June<br> The earth had, and the budding linden-grove<br> About the homestead, with the brown bird's tune<br> Was happy, and the faint blue sky above<br> The black-thorn blossoms made meet roof for love,<br> For though the south wind breathed a thought of rain,<br> No cloud as yet its golden breadth did stain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That afternoon within his well-hung hall,<br> Amidst of many thoughts the goodman lay<br> Until a gentle sleep on him &#146;gan fall,<br> And he began to dream, but the sweet day<br> The dream forgat not, nor could wipe away<br> The pictures of his home that seemed so good,<br> For midst his garden in his dream he stood;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hand in hand with his wife he seemed to be,<br> And both their eyes were lovingly intent<br> Upon a little blossom fair to see<br> Before their feet, that through the fresh air sent<br> Sweet odours; but as over it they bent, <A NAME="page_282"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 282</FONT></A><br> The day seemed changed to cloudiness and rain,<br> And the sweet flower, whereof they were so fain,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was grown a goodly sapling, and they gazed<br> Wondering thereat, but loved it nothing less.<br> But as they looked a bright flame round it blazed,<br> And hid it for a space, and weariness<br> The souls of both the good folk did oppress,<br> And on the earth they lay down side by side,<br> And unto them it was as they had died.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet did they know that o&#146;er them hung the tree<br> Grown mighty, thick-leaved, on each bough did hang<br> Crown, sword, or ship, or temple fair to see;<br> And therewithal a great wind through it sang,<br> And trumpet blast there was; and armour rang<br> Amid that leafy world, and now and then<br> Strange songs were sung in tongues of outland men.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid these sounds the goodman heard at last<br> A song in his own tongue, and sat upright<br> And blinking at the broad bright sun that cast<br> A straight beam through the window, making bright<br> The dusky hangings; till his gathering sight<br> Showed him outside two damsels, pail on head,<br> Who went by, singing, to the milking shed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And meeting them with jingling bit and trace <A NAME="page_283"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 283</FONT></A><br> Came the grey team from field; a merry lad<br> Sat sideways on the foremost, broad of face,<br> Freckled and flaxen-haired, whose red lips had<br> A primrose &#146;twixt them, yet still blithe and glad,<br> With muffled whistle, swinging, did he mock<br> The maidens' song and the brown throstle-cock.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then rose the goodman, happy, for his dream<br> Seemed nowise ill to think on; rather he<br> Some echo of his hopes the thing did deem<br> If hardly any certain prophecy<br> Of happy things in time to come to be;<br> And into the March sun he wandered forth,<br> With life and wealth all grown of double worth.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From barn to well-stocked field he went that eve,<br> Smiling on all, and wondering how it was<br> That any one in such a world might grieve,<br> At least for long, at what might come to pass;<br> The soft south-wind, the flowers amid the grass,<br> The fragrant earth, the sweet sounds everywhere,<br> Seemed gifts too great almost for man to bear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long wandered he, the happiest of all men<br> Till day was gone, and the white moon and high<br> Cast a long shadow on the white stones, when<br> He came once more his homestead door anigh;<br> And there a girl stood watching, and a cry <A NAME="page_284"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 284</FONT></A><br> Burst from her lips when she beheld him come;<br> She said, "O welcome to thy twice-blessed home!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thy wife hath borne to thee a maiden fair,<br> Come and behold it, and give thanks withal<br> Unto the Gods, who thus have heard thy prayer."<br> Sweetly that voice upon his ears did fall,<br> &#146;Twixt him and utter bliss no bounding wall<br> Seemed raised now, nor did end of life-seem nigh;<br> Once more he had forgot that he must die.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on the morrow high feast did he hold,<br> And all the guests with gifts were satisfied,<br> And gladdened were the Gods of field and fold,<br> With many a beast that at their altars died.<br> How should the spring of all that wealth be dried?<br> Nought did he deal with untried things or strange,<br> &#146;Twixt year and year how might the seasons change?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, by next year, grown had the child and thriven<br> Unto his heart's desire, and in his hall<br> Again was high feast held, and good gifts given<br> To the departing guests; yet did it fall<br> That somewhat his goods minished therewithal,<br> But little grief it gave him; "Ah, let be<br> This year will raise the scale once more," said he.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as the time passed, with the child's increase<br> Did ill luck grow apace, till field by field <A NAME="page_285"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 285</FONT></A><br> Fell his lands from him; nought he knew of ease,<br> Yet little good hap did his trouble yield;<br> The Gods belike a new bag had unsealed<br> Of hopeless longing for him, and his day<br> Mid restless yearning still must pass away.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>SO things went on, till June of that same year<br> Whereof I tell, when nineteen May-tides green<br> The maid had looked on, and was grown so fair<br> That never yet the like of her had been<br> Within that land; and her divine soft mien,<br> Her eyes and her soft speech, now blessed alone<br> A house wherefrom all fair things else were gone.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet whoso gloomed thereat, not she it was<br> Who with her grave set face and heart unmoved,<br> Watched, wearied not nor pleased, each new day pass;<br> Nor thought of change, she said. As well behoved,<br> By many men ere now was she beloved;<br> Wild words she oft had heard, and harder grown<br> At bitter tears about her fair feet strown.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For far apart from these she seemed to be,<br> Their joys and sorrows moved her not, and they<br> Looked upon her as some divinity,<br> And cursed her not, though whiles she seemed to lay<br> A curse on them unwitting, and the day <A NAME="page_286"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 286</FONT></A><br> Seemed grown unhappy, useless, as she came<br> With eyes fulfilled of thoughts of life and shame</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across their simple merriment. Meanwhile<br> She laboured as need was, nor heeded aught<br> What thing she did, nor yet did aught seem vile<br> More than another that the long day brought<br> Unto her hands; and as her father fought<br> Against his bitter foe, she watched it all<br> As though in some strange play the thing did fall.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he, who loved her yet amidst of fear,<br> Would look upon her, wondering, even as though<br> He, daring not her soul to draw anear,<br> Yet of her hopes and fears was fain to know,<br> Was fain to hope that she one day would show<br> In what wise he within her heart was borne;<br> Yea, if that day he found in her but scorn.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It fell then in the June-tide, mid these things,<br> That on an eve within the bare great hall,<br> When nigh the window the bat's flickering wings<br> Were brushing, and the soft dew fast did fall,<br> And o&#146;er the ferry far away did call<br> The homeward-hastening traveller? that the three<br> Sat resting in that soft obscurity.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some tale belike unto the other two<br> The goodman had been telling, for he said, <A NAME="page_287"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 287</FONT></A><br> &#147;Well, in the end no more the thieves might do,<br> For when enough of them were hurt or dead<br> Needs must they cry for quarter; by Jove's head,<br> That parley as sweet music did I hear,<br> Who for three hours had seen grim death anear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;So then their tall ship did we take in tow,<br> And beached her in the bay with no small pain.<br> The painted dragon-head, that ye note now<br> Grin at Jove's temple-door with gapings vain,<br> And her steel beaks the merchant-galleys&#146; bane,<br> We smote away; with every second oar<br> We roofed that house of refuge nigh the shore.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Then fell we unto ransacking her hold,<br> And left them store of meal, but took away<br> Armour, fair cloths, and silver things and gold,<br> Rich raiment, wine and honey; then we lay<br> Upon the beach that latter end of day,<br> And shared the spoil by drawing short and long&#151;<br> That was before my fate &#146;gan do me wrong,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;And good things gat I; two such casks of wine,<br> And such a jar of honey, as would make<br> The very Gods smile, had they come to dine<br> E&#146;en in this bare hall; ah! my heart doth ache,<br> O daughter Rhodope, for thy sweet sake<br> When of the gold-sewn purple robe I tell<br> That certes now had matched thy beauty well. <A NAME="page_288"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 288</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;What else? a crested helm all golden wrought,<br> A bow and sheaf of arrows&#151;there they hang<br> Since they with one thing else came not to nought<br> Of all the things o&#146;er which the goodwife sang,<br> When on the threshold first my spear-butt rang,<br> And o&#146;er the bay the terror of the sea<br> With clipped wings laboured slow and painfully.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Take down the bow, goodwife; a thing of price<br> Though unadorned, therefore it yet bides here;<br> For trusty is it in the wood, and wise<br> The long shafts are to find the dappled deer<br> And mend our four days' fast with better cheer.<br> But for the other thing&#151;the twilight fails<br> Amid these half-remembered woeful tales;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So light the taper for a little while<br> To see a marvel." Therewith speedily<br> The goodwife turned and lighted up her smile,<br> And deep-set eyes turned full on Rhodope<br> As hoping there some eagerness to see;<br> But on the brightening stars her wide eyes stared<br> E&#146;en when the taper through the darkness glared.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to the great chest did the goodman go,<br> And turning o&#146;er the coarser household gear<br> That lay therein, much stuff aside did throw<br> Ere from the lowest depths his hand did bear<br> A silken cloth of red, embroidered fair, <A NAME="page_289"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 289</FONT></A><br> Wrapped about something; this upon the board<br> He laid, and &#146;gan unfold the precious hoard.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With languid eyes that hoped for little joy<br> Did Rhodope, now turning, gaze thereon,<br> And wait the showing forth of the fair toy,<br> In days long past from fear and battle won;<br> But yet a strange light in her bright eyes shone<br> When now the goodman did the cloth unfold,<br> And showed the gleam of precious gems and gold.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there upon the silken cloth now lay<br> Twin shoes first made for some fair woman's feet,<br> Wrought like the meadows of an April day,<br> With gems amidst the sun of gold; most meet<br> To show in kings&#146; halls, when the music sweet<br> Is at its softest, and the dance grown slow,<br> Midst of white folds the feet of maids may show.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now unto these fair things went Rhodope,<br> And, blushing faintly, &#146;gan the latchets touch,<br> And drew her hand across them daintily,<br> Then let it fall, smiling, that overmuch<br> She thought of them, then turned away to such<br> Rude work as then the season asked of her,<br> With face firm set that weary life to bear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said the goodman, with a rueful smile <A NAME="page_290"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 290</FONT></A><br> Upon her, &#147;Chick or child I had not then,<br> But riches, wherewith fortune did beguile<br> My heart to ask for more; and now again<br> That thou grow&#146;st fairer than the seed of men,<br> All goes from me&#151;and let these go withal,<br> Since I am thrust so rudely to the wall!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Long have I kept them; first, for this indeed,<br> That few men of our land have will therefor<br> To pay me duly; and the coming need<br> Still did I fear would make the past less sore;<br> And then withal a man well skilled in lore<br> Grew dreamy o&#146;er them once, and said that they<br> Bore with them promise of a changing day.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Yet bread is life, and while we live we yet<br> May turn a corner of this barren lane,<br> And Jove's high-priest hath ever prayed to get<br> These fair things, and prayed hitherto in vain:<br> Belike a yoke of oxen might I gain<br> To turn the home-field deeper, when the corn,<br> Such as it is, to barn and stack is borne.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;The meal-ark groweth empty too, and thou,<br> O fairest daughter, worthy to be clad<br> In weed like this, shalt feel November blow<br> No blessing to thee; cask-staves must be had<br> Against the vintage, seeing that men wax glad <A NAME="page_291"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 291</FONT></A><br> Already o&#146;er the bunches, and the year<br> Folk deem great wealth to all men's sons will bear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So, daughter, unto thee this charge I give<br> To take these things tomorrow morn with thee<br> Unto Jove's priest, and say, we needs must live;<br> Therefore these fair shoes do I let him see,<br> That he may say what he will give to me,<br> That they may shine upon his daughter's feet,<br> When she goes forth the sacrifice to meet."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as he spake again a light flush came<br> Into her cheek, and died away again;<br> Then cried the goodwife; "Ah, thou bearest shame,<br> That we are fallen &#146;neath the feet of men,<br> That thou goest like a slave! what didst thou then<br> So coldly e&#146;en on this man's son to look,<br> That he thy scornful eyes no more might brook?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still sat Rhodope, as though of stone<br> Her face was, and the goodman spake and said;<br> "Nay, mother, nay, she is not such an one<br> As lightly to our highest to be wed<br> Before the crown of love has touched her head:<br> Be patient; hast thou ne&#146;er heard stories tell<br> What things to such as her of old befell?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindly he smiled at her, as half he meant<br> The words he said; but now her changeless eye <A NAME="page_292"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 292</FONT></A><br> Cast on him one hard glance, and then she bent<br> Over her work, and with a half-choked sigh<br> The goodman rose, and from a corner nigh<br> Took up some willow-withes, and so began<br> To shape the handle of a winnowing fan.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>BUT with the new day's sun might you behold<br> The maiden's feet firm planted on the way<br> Which led unto the vale, where field and fold<br> About the temple of the Thunderer lay,<br> And the priest wrought, a sturdy carle today<br> Within the hay-field or behind the plough,<br> Tomorrow dealing with high things enow.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First betwixt sunny meads the highway ran<br> With homesteads set therein, and vineyards green,<br> Now merry with the voice of maid and man,<br> Who shouted greetings the tall rows between,<br> Whereto she answered softly, as a queen<br> Who feels herself of other make to be<br> Than those who worship her divinity.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark-eyed shepherd slowly by her passed,<br> And from his face faded the merry smile,<br> And down upon the road his eyes he cast,<br> And strove with other names his heart to wile<br> From thought of her; so coarse he seemed and vile <A NAME="page_293"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 293</FONT></A><br> Before her smileless face, o&#146;er which there shone<br> Some glory, as of a bright secret sun,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was for her alone. The mother stood<br> Within her door, and as the gown of grey<br> Fluttered about her, and the coarse white hood<br> Flashed from the oak-shade o&#146;er the sunlit way,<br> She muttered after her; "Ah, have thy day,<br> If thou wert set high up as thou art low,<br> On many a neck those feet of thine should go!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But heeding little of the hearts of these<br> She went upon her way, and walking fast<br> Soon left the tilled fields and the cottages,<br> For toward the mountain-slopes the highway passed,<br> And turned unto the south, and &#146;gan at last<br> To mount aloft &#146;twixt heathery slopes set o&#146;er<br> With red-trunked pines, and mossy rocks and hoar.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still fast she went, though high the sun was grown,<br> For on strange thoughts and wild her heart was set;<br> Those things held in the bosom of her gown<br> Seemed teaching hopes she might not soon forget;<br> She clenched her hands harder and harder yet,<br> And cried aloud; &#147;So small, so quickly done,<br> O idle, timorous life beneath the sun!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;And here amid these fields and mountains grey,<br> Drop after drop slowly it ebbs from me, <A NAME="page_294"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 294</FONT></A><br> And leaves no new thing gained; day like to day,<br> Face like to face, as waves in some calm sea!<br> With memory of our sad mortality<br> Pipes the dull tune of earth, nought comes anigh<br> To give us some bright dream before we die.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;What say&#146;st thou&#151;'Beautiful thou art and livest,<br> And men there are, strong, young and fair enow,<br> To take with thankful heart e&#146;en what thou givest;<br> Love and be loved then!'&#151;Nay, heart, dost thou know<br> How through thin flame of love thou still wilt show<br> The long years set with mocking images,<br> Ready to trap me if I think of these?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Ah, love they say, and love! Shall not love fade<br> And turn a prison, barred with vain regret<br> And vain remorse that we so lightly weighed,<br> The woes wherein our stumbling feet were set,<br> Stifling with thoughts we never may forget;<br> Because life waneth, while we strive to turn<br> And seek another thing for which to yearn.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;So deem I of the life that holds me here,<br> As though I were the shade of one long dead,<br> Come back a while from Pluto's region drear<br> To mine own land where unremembered<br> My fathers are&#151;Lo, now, these words just said,<br> This heathery slope my feet are passing o&#146;er,<br> Yon grey-winged dove&#151;has it not been before? <A NAME="page_295"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 295</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Would then that I were gone, and lived again<br> Another life;&#151;if it must still be so,<br> That life on life passes, forgotten, vain<br> To still our longings, that no soul can know<br> By what has been how this and this shall go&#151;<br> Because methinks I yet have heard men tell<br> How lives there were wherein great things befell.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;How mid such life had I forgot the past,<br> Nor thought about the future! but been glad<br> While round my head a dreamy veil I cast,<br> And seemed to strive with seeming good or bad;<br> Till at the last some dream I might have had<br> That nigh a god I was become to be,<br> And, dying, yet should keep all memory;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Know what I was, nor change my hope and fear<br> All utterly, but learn why I was born,<br> Nor come to loathe what once to me was dear,<br> Nor dwell amidst a world of ghosts forlorn,<br> Nor see kind eyes, and hear kind words, with scorn.<br> &#151;But ye, O fields, and hills, and steads of men,<br> Why are ye fair to mock my longings then?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therewithal panting she turned, and stood<br> High up the hillside; a light fitful wind<br> Sung mournful ditties through the pine-tree wood<br> That edged the borders of the pass behind,<br> And made most fitting music to her mind, <A NAME="page_296"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 296</FONT></A><br> But clear and hot the day of June did grow,<br> And a fair picture spread out down below.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green hill-slopes, besprinkled o&#146;er with kine,<br> And a grey neat-herd wandering here and there,<br> And then the greener squares of well-propped vine,<br> The changing cornfields, and the homesteads fair,<br> The white road winding on, that yet did bear<br> Specks as of men and horses; the grey sea<br> Meeting the dim horizon dreamily.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while she gazed, then, with a sigh,<br> She turned again, and went on toward the pass,<br> But slowly now, and somewhat wearily,<br> And murmuring as she met the coarser grass<br> Within the shade: "What, something moved I was,<br> By hope, and pity of myself! Well then,<br> I shall not have that joy so oft again."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with bent head, &#146;twixt rocky wall and wall,<br> Slowly she went, and scarce knew what she thought,<br> So many a picture on her heart did fall,<br> Nor would she let one wish to her be brought<br> Of good or better. Going so, distraught,<br> The long rough road was nothing to her feet,<br> Nor took she heed of what her eyes might meet.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But so far through the pass at last she came,<br> That the road fell unto the temple-vale, <A NAME="page_297"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 297</FONT></A><br> And there she stopped and started, for her name<br> She heard called out. She thought of many a tale<br> Of gods who brought to mortals joy or bale,<br> For so, despite herself, her thoughts would run,<br> That all the joy of life was not yet done.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from the hillside came a dappled hound<br> That fawned upon her e&#146;en as one he knew,<br> And when she raised her eyes, and looked around,<br> She saw the man indeed he &#146;longed unto,<br> A huntsman armed, and clad in gown of blue,<br> Come clattering down the stones of the pass-side;<br> So, standing still, his coming did she bide.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled a smile that was not all of bliss,<br> For this was he of whom her mother spake,<br> The high-priest's son, who fain had made her his;<br> And at the sight of him her heart did ache<br> With hapless thoughts, and scorn and shame &#146;gan wake<br> Within her mind, that still she strove to lull,<br> Calling herself both cursed and beautiful.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, while she gathered heart of grace to meet<br> The few words they might speak together there,<br> He was beside her; slim he was and fleet,<br> Well knit, with dark-brown eyes and crisp black hair,<br> Eager of aspect, round-chinned, fresh, and fair,<br> And well attired as for that simple folk<br> Who in those days might bear no great man's yoke. <A NAME="page_298"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 298</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now his lip trembled, and he blushed blood-red,<br> Then turned all pale again. "O Rhodope,<br> Right fair thou go&#146;st afoot this morn," he said;<br> "Hast thou some errand with my sire or me?"<br> And therewithal, as if unwittingly,<br> Unto her hand did he stretch out his hand;<br> But moveless as an image did she stand,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that her gown was fluttering in the wind<br> That came up from the pass. She spake as one<br> That hath no care at heart: "I thought to find<br> Thy father, and to give to him alone<br> A message from my father. Is he gone?"<br> He seemed to swallow something in his throat:<br> "These two nights, maiden, hath he been afloat,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Watching the tunnies; if thou turn&#146;st again<br> Thou well mayst meet him coming from the sea."<br> "Nay," said she, "neither wholly shall be vain<br> My coming so far, since I have with me<br> Poor offerings meet for the divinity<br> From poor folk, which my mother bade me bear<br> To bless this midmost month of the glad year."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In a good hour," he said, "for I have done<br> Little against the roes whereof to tell,<br> So I will fare with thee; and till the sun<br> Is getting low, in our house shalt thou dwell,<br> And in the evening, if it like thee well, <A NAME="page_299"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 299</FONT></A><br> With helmet on the head, and well-strung bow,<br> Beside thee to thine own home will I go."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought spake she for a while, and his heart beat<br> Quicker with hope of some small happiness;<br> But at the last her eyes his eyes did meet.<br> She spake: &#147;Few hearts this heart of mine will bless,<br> And yet for thee will I do nothing less<br> Than save thee from the anguish of the strife,<br> Wherewith thou fain wouldst make my life thy life.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Thou art unhappy now, but we may part,<br> And to us both is left long lapse of time<br> To gain new bliss. What wouldst thou? To my heart<br> Cold now and alien are this folk and clime,<br> And while I dwell with them no woe or crime,<br> If so I may, shall stain my garments&#146; hem;<br> Thou art an image like the rest of them:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Yea, but an image unto me alone,<br> For unto thee this world is wide enow,<br> Full of warm hearts enow&#151;so get thee gone<br> Upon thy way. I am not fallen so low<br> As unto thee dreams of false love to show,<br> Or for my very heart's own weariness<br> To give thee clinging life-long sharp distress.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now fain I would unto the temple-stead;<br> And, if thou mayst, do thou go otherwhere, <A NAME="page_300"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 300</FONT></A><br> For good it were that all thy hopes were dead,<br> Since nought but bitter fruit they now can bear."<br> He gazed at her as one who doth not hear,<br> Or hears an outland tongue ill understood;<br> Wild love and hate made wild-fire of his blood.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, she belike was nigher unto death<br> Than she might know; yet did he turn at last<br> And, clutching tight his short-sword's gold-wrought sheath,<br> Slowly along the seaward way he passed,<br> Nor backward at her any look he cast,<br> For fate would not that his blind eyes should see<br> How on the way her tears fell plenteously.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet not long there she stayed, but set her face<br> Unto the downward road, but had not fared<br> A many yards from that their meeting-place,<br> Before upon the wind a sound she heard,<br> As though some poor wretch a great sorrow bared<br> Unto the eyes of heaven, and then her feet<br> With quicker steps the stony way did meet.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon she said: "O fate, all left behind,<br> I follow thee adown the bitter road<br> With weary feet, and heavy eyes and blind,<br> That leadeth to thy far unknown abode;<br> No need, then, with thy stings my flesh to goad,<br> Keep them for those that strive with thee in vain,<br> And leave me to my constant weary pain." <A NAME="page_301"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 301</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the pass, widening, to her eyes did show<br> The little vale hemmed in by hills around,<br> Wherein was Jove's house fair and great enow,<br> Some three miles thence, but on a rising ground,<br> And with fair fields as a green girdle bound,<br> And guarded well by long low houses white,<br> Orchards for fruit, and gardens for delight.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far off, like little spots of white, she saw<br> The long-winged circling pigeons glittering<br> Above the roofs, the noise of rook and daw<br> Came sweet upon the wind from the dark ring<br> Of elms that edged the cornfields; with wide wing<br> The fork-tailed restless kite sailed over her,<br> Hushing the twitter of the linnets near.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stayed now, gazing downward; at her feet<br> A dark wood clad the hollow of the hill,<br> And its black shade a little lake did meet,<br> Whose waters smooth a babbling stream did still,<br> Then toward the temple-stead stretched on, until<br> Green meads with oaks beset &#146;gan hem it in,<br> And from its nether end the stream did win.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gazed and saw not, heard and did not hear,<br> But said: &#147;Once more have I been vehement,<br> Have spoken out, as if I knew from where<br> Come good and ill, and whither they are sent,<br> As though I knew whereon I was intent; <A NAME="page_302"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 302</FONT></A><br> So, knowing that I know not, e&#146;en as these<br> Who think themselves as gods and goddesses</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To know both good and evil must I do.<br> Now ne&#146;er again in this wise shall it be<br> While here I dwell, nor shall false hope shine through<br> My prison bars, false passion jeer at me<br> With what might hap if I were changed and free;<br> The end shall come at last, and find me here,<br> Desiring nought, and free from hope or fear."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So saying, but with face cleared not at all,<br> Rather with trembling lips, upon her way<br> Once more she went; short now did shadows fall,<br> It grew unto the hottest of the day,<br> And round the mountain-tops the sky waxed grey<br> For very heat; June's sceptre o&#146;er the earth,<br> If rest it gave, kept back some little mirth.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last upon the bridge the stream that crossed<br> Just ere it met the lake she set her feet,<br> And walked on swiftly, e&#146;en as one clean lost<br> In thought, till at its end her skirt did meet<br> A bough of briar-rose, whose pale blossoms sweet<br> Were draggled in the dust; she stooped thereto<br> And from her hem its hooked green thorns she drew.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then drawing a deep breath, she cast aside<br> The broken bough; and from the dusty road <A NAME="page_303"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 303</FONT></A><br> She turned, and o&#146;er the parapet she eyed<br> The broad blue lake, the basking pike's abode,<br> And the dark oakwood where the pigeons cooed;<br> And as she gazed, some little touch of bliss<br> Came over her amidst her loneliness.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drowsy she felt, and weary with the way,<br> And mid such listlessness that brought no pain,<br> She drew her arms from off the coping grey,<br> And o&#146;er the bridge went slowly back again,<br> As though no whit of purpose did remain<br> Within her mind; but when the other end<br> She passed, along the stream she &#146;gan to wend.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She watched its eddies till it widened out<br> Into the breezy lake, and even there<br> Began the wood; so then she turned about,<br> And shading her grave eyes with fingers fair,<br> Beneath the sun beheld temple glare<br> O&#146;er the far tree-tops; then down<br> Within the shade on last year's oak-leaves brown.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There as she lay, at last her fingers stole<br> Unto the things that on her bosom lay,<br> She drew them forth and slowly &#146;gan unroll<br> The silken cloth, until a wandering ray<br> Upon the shoes&#146; bright &#146;broideries &#146;gan to play<br> Through the thick leaves; and with a flickering smile<br> She &#146;gan her mind with stories to beguile. <A NAME="page_304"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 304</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pondering for whom those dainty things were wrought,<br> And in what land; and in what wondrous wise<br> She missed the gift of them; and what things brought<br> The sea-thieves to her land&#151;until her eyes<br> Fell on her own gear wrought in homely guise,<br> And with a half smile she let fall the gold<br> And glistening gems her listless hand did hold.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then long she lay there, gazing at the sky<br> Between the thick leaves, growing drowsier,<br> While slowly the grey rabbit hobbled by,<br> And the slim squirrel twisted over her<br> As one to heed not; as if none were near<br> The woodpecker slipped up the smooth-barked tree,<br> The water-hen clucked nigh her fearlessly.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in a little while she woke, and still<br> Felt as if dreaming, all seemed far away<br> Save present rest, both hope and fear and ill;<br> The sun was past the middle of the day,<br> But bathed in flood of light the world still lay,<br> And all was quiet, but for faint sounds made<br> By the wood creatures wild and unafraid.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From out her wallet now coarse food she drew,<br> And ate with dainty mouth, then o&#146;er the strip<br> Of dazzling sunlight where the daisies grew<br> Unto the babbling streamlet's rushy lip<br> She went, and kneeling down thereby did dip <A NAME="page_305"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 305</FONT></A><br> Her hollow hand into the water grey<br> And drank, then back again she went her way.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There &#146;neath the tree-bole lay the glittering shoes,<br> And over them she stood awhile and gazed,<br> Then stooped adown as though one might not choose;<br> And from the grass one by the latchet raised,<br> And with the eyes of one by slumber dazed<br> Did off her own foot-gear, and one by one<br> Set the bright things her shapely feet upon.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to the thick wood slowly did she turn,<br> And through its cool shade wandered till once more<br> Thinner it grew, and spots of light did burn<br> Upon her jewelled feet, till lay before<br> Her upraised eyes a bay with sandy shore;<br> And &#146;twixt the waves and birds' abiding place<br> Was stretched a treeless, sunlit, grassy space.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friendly the sun, the bright flowers, and the grass<br> Seemed after the dark wood; with upraised gown<br> Slowly unto the water did she pass,<br> And on the grassy edge she sat her down;<br> And since right swift these latter hours had flown<br> Less did the sun burn; there awhile she lay<br> Watching a little breeze sweep up the bay.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shallow it was, a shore of hard white sand<br> Met the green herbage, and as clear as glass <A NAME="page_306"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 306</FONT></A><br> The water ran in ripples o&#146;er that strand,<br> Until it well-nigh touched the flowery grass;<br> A dainty bath for weary limbs it was,<br> And so our maiden thought belike, for she<br> &#146;Gan put her raiment from her languidly.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until at last from out her poor array,<br> Pure did she rise e&#146;en as that other One<br> Rose up from out the ragged billows grey,<br> For earth's dull days and heavy to atone;<br> How like another sun her gold hair shone;<br> In the green place, as down she knelt, and raised<br> The glittering shoes, and long time on them gazed,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As on strange guides that thus had brought her there,<br> Then cast them by, so that apart they fell,<br> And in the sunlight glittering lay and fair,<br> Like the elves&#146; blossoms, hard and lacking smell;<br> Then to the sward she stooped, and bud and bell<br> Of the June's children gat into her hand,<br> And left the grass for the scarce-covered sand.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood to watch the thin waves mount her feet<br> Before she tried the deep, then toward the wide,<br> Sun-litten space she turned, and &#146;gan to meet<br> The freshness of the water cool, and sighed<br> For pleasure as the little rippling tide<br> Lapped her about, and slow she wandered on<br> Till many a yard from shore she now had won. <A NAME="page_307"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 307</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, as she played, she heard a bird's harsh cry,<br> And looking to the steep hill-side could see<br> A broad-winged eagle hovering anigh,<br> And stood to watch his sweeping flight and free<br> Dark &#146;gainst the sky, then turned round leisurely<br> Unto the bank, and saw a bright red ray<br> Shoot from a great gem on the sea-thieves&#146; prey.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then slowly through the water did she move,<br> Down on the changing ripple gazing still,<br> As loth to leave it, and once more above<br> Her golden head rang out the erne's note shrill,<br> Grown nigher now; she turned unto the hill,<br> And saw him not, and once again her eyes<br> Fell on the strange shoes&#146; jewelled &#146;broideries.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even therewithal a noise of wings<br> Flapping, and close at hand&#151;again the cry,<br> And then the glitter of those dainty things<br> Was gone, as a great mass fell suddenly,<br> And rose again, ere Rhodope could try<br> To raise her voice, for now might she behold<br> Within his claws the gleam of gems and gold.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awhile she gazed at him as, circling wide,<br> He soared aloft, and for a space could see<br> The gold shoe glitter, till the rock-crowned side<br> Of the great mountain hid him presently,<br> And she &#146;gan laugh that such a thing should be <A NAME="page_308"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 308</FONT></A><br> So wrought of fate, for little did she fear<br> The lack of their poor wealth, or pinching cheer.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when she was aland again and clad,<br> And turned back through the wood, a sudden thought<br> Shot through her heart, and made her somewhat glad;<br> "Small things," she said, "her feet had thither brought:<br> Perchance this strange hap should not be for nought."<br> And therewithal stories she &#146;gan to tell<br> Unto her heart how such things once befell,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How as it had been it might be again.<br> Then from her odorous breast she took the shoe<br> Yet left, and turned it o&#146;er and o&#146;er in vain,<br> If yet she might therein find aught of new<br> To tell her what all meant; and thus she drew<br> Unto the wood's edge, and once more sat down<br> Upon the fresh grass and the oak-leaves brown.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there beneath the quickly sinking sun<br> She took again her foot-gear cast aside,<br> And, scarce beholding them now, did them on;<br> And while the pie from out the oak-boughs cried<br> Over her head, arose and slowly hied<br> Unto the road again, and backward turned<br> Up through the pass. Blood-red behind her burned</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunless sky, and scarce awake she seemed,<br> As &#146;gainst the hill she toiled, and when at last <A NAME="page_309"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 309</FONT></A><br> Beneath the moon far off the grey sea gleamed,<br> And all the rugged mountain road was passed,<br> Back from her eyes the wandering locks she cast,<br> And o&#146;er her cheeks warm ran the tears, as she<br> Told herself tales of what she yet might be.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>BUT cold awakening had she when she came<br> Unto the half-deserted homestead gate,<br> And she must think hoed she would take the blame<br> That from her mother did her deed await,<br> Without a slave-like frightened frown at fate;<br> Must harden yet her heart once more to face<br> Her father's wondering sigh at his hard case.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when within the dimly-lighted hall<br> Her mother's wrath brake out, as she did hear<br> Her cold words, and her father's knife did fall<br> Clattering adown; then seemed all life so drear,<br> Hapless and loveless, and so hard to bear,<br> So little worth the bearing, that a pang<br> Of very hate from out her heart up-sprang.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With cold eyes, but a smile on her red lips,<br> She watched them; how her father stooped again<br> And took his knife, and how once more the chips<br> Flew from the bowl half finished, but in vain,<br> Because he saw it not; she watched the rain <A NAME="page_310"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 310</FONT></A><br> Of tears wherewith her mother did bewail<br> That all her joy in her one child should fail.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when her mother's tears to sobs were turned<br> The goodman rose and took her hand in his,<br> And then, with sunken eyes for love that yearned,<br> Gazed hard at her, and said, &#147;Nay, child, some bliss<br> Awaits thee surely yet; enough it is;<br> Trouble and hunger shall not chase me long,<br> The walls of one abiding-place are strong;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And thither now I go apace, my child."<br> Askance she looked at him with steady eyes,<br> But when she saw that midst his words he smiled<br> With trembling lips, then in her heart &#146;gan rise<br> Strange thoughts that troubled her like memories<br> And changed her face; she drew her hands from him,<br> And yet before her eyes his face waxed dim.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then down the old man sat, and now began<br> To talk of how their life went, and their needs,<br> In cheerful strain; and, even as a man,<br> Unbeaten yet by fortune's spiteful deeds,<br> Spoke of the troublous twisted way that leads<br> To peace and happiness, till to a smile<br> The goodwife's tearful face he did beguile.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So slipped the night away, and the June sun<br> Rose the next morn as though no woe there were <A NAME="page_311"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 311</FONT></A><br> Upon the earth, and never anyone<br> Was blind with love or bent by hopeless care;<br> But small content was in the homestead there,<br> Despite the bright-eyed June, for unto two<br> That dwelt there life still held too much to do.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While to the third, empty of deeds it seemed,<br> A dragging dulness changed by here a pain<br> And there a hope, waking or sleeping dreamed,<br> But, waking still or sleeping, dreamed in vain;<br> For how could anything be loss or gain<br> When still the order of the world went round,<br> And still the wall of death all hopes did bound?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So said she oft, and fell to hating men;<br> Nevertheless with hope still beat her heart,<br> And changing thoughts that rose and fell again<br> Would stir within her as she sat apart,<br> And to her brow the unbidden blood would start,<br> And she would rise, nor know whereon she trod,<br> And forth she walked as one who walks with God.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oftener indeed that dull and heavy mood<br> Oppressed her, and when any were anigh,<br> Little she spake, either of bad or good,<br> Nor would she heed the folk that were thereby<br> So much as thereon to look scornfully;<br> Unless perchance her father stood anear,<br> And then her set hard face she strove to clear. <A NAME="page_312"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 312</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if he, fearful, answered with no smile<br> Unto the softening eyes, yet when he went<br> About his labour, would he so beguile<br> His heart with thought of her, that right content<br> He &#146;gan to feel with what the Gods had sent;<br> The little flame of love that in him burned,<br> Hard things and ill to part of pleasure turned.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withal his worldly things went not so ill<br> As for a luckless man; the bounteous year<br> More than before his barn and vats did fill<br> With the earth's fruit, and bettered was his cheer,<br> So that he watched the winter draw anear<br> Calmly this tide, and deemed he yet might live,<br> Some joy unto his daughter's heart to give.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the one shoe that the erne had left,<br> The goodwife's word was, "Take the cursed thing,<br> And when the gems from out it are all reft,<br> Into the fire the weaver's rag go fling;<br> Would in like wise the fond desires, that cling<br> To Rhodope's proud heart, we thus might burn,<br> That she to some good life at last might turn!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think some poison with a double curse<br> Hath smitten her, and double wilfulness,<br> For surely now she groweth worse and worse,<br> Since the bright rag her wayworn foot did press&#151;<br> Well then&#151;and surely thou wilt do no less <A NAME="page_313"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 313</FONT></A><br> Than as I bid&#151;a many things we need,<br> More than this waif of cast-off-royal weed."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With querulous voice she spake, because she saw<br> Her husband look at Rhodope, as she<br> Still through her fingers did the grey thread draw<br> From out the rock, and sitting quietly<br> Seemed not to heed what all the talk might be;<br> But for the goodman's self he answered not<br> Until at last the goodwife waxed o&#146;er hot;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laid hard word on word, till she began<br> To say, "Alas, and wherefore was I wed<br> To such an one as is a foredoomed man?<br> Lo, all this grief hast thou brought on my head,<br> So wander forth, and dream as do the dead<br> When to the shadowy land they first are brought!<br> Surely thou knowest that we lack for nought!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then blind with rage from out the place she went,<br> But still the goodman stood awhile, and gazed<br> At Rhodope, who sat as if intent<br> Upon her work, nor aught her fair head raised.<br> At last he spake: &#147;Well, never was I praised<br> For wisdom overmuch before this day,<br> And can I now be certain of the way?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"True is it that our needs are many and sore, <A NAME="page_314"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 314</FONT></A><br> And that those gems would help us plenteously,<br> Yet do I grudge now more than heretofore<br> The very last of that strange gift to see.<br> What sayest thou, how dost thou counsel me,<br> O daughter? didst thou ever hear folk tell<br> Of the strange dream that at thy birth befell?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blood-red her face grew as she looked on him,<br> And with her foot the twirling spindle stayed.<br> "Yea," said she, "something have I heard, but dim<br> My memory is, and little have I weighed<br> The worth thereof." The goodman smiled and said,<br> "Nay, child, as little wise as I may be,<br> Yet know I that thou liest certainly.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And so no need there is to tell the tale,<br> Or ask thee more what thou wouldst have me do;<br> Have thou thy will, for fate will still prevail,<br> Though oft we deem we lead her thereunto<br> Where lies our good&#151;Daughter, keep thou the shoe,<br> And let the wise men with their wisdom play,<br> While we go dream about a happier day."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he was speaking had she laid adown<br> The rock, and risen unto her feet, and now<br> Upon her bosom lay his visage brown,<br> As round him both her fair arms did she throw;<br> Softly she said, "Somewhat thy need I know, <A NAME="page_315"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 315</FONT></A><br> Remember this whatever happeneth,<br> Let it make sweet the space &#146;twixt this and death!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hard is the world; I, loved ere I was born,<br> This once alone perchance thy heart shall feel,<br> And thou shalt go about, of love forlorn,<br> And little move my heart of stone and steel:<br> Ah, if another life our life might heal,<br> And love become no more the sport of time,<br> Chained upon either hand to pain and crime!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little time she hung about him thus,<br> And then her arms from round his neck unwound,<br> And went her ways; his mouth grew piteous<br> When he had lost her fluttering gown's light sound,<br> And fast his tears &#146;gan fall upon the ground.<br> At last he turned: "So is it now," he said,<br> "With me as with a man soon to be dead.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wise is he all at once, and knows not why,<br> And brave who erst was timorous; fair of speech,<br> Whose tongue once stammered with uncertainty,<br> Because his soul to the dark land doth reach.<br> And is it so that love to me doth teach<br> New things, because he needs must get him gone,<br> And leave me with his memories all alone?" <A NAME="page_316"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 316</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>SO the year passed, as has been writ afore,<br> With better hopes; the pinching winter-tide<br> Went by, and spring his tender longings bore<br> Into all hearts, and scattered troubles wide,<br> Nor yet to see the fruit of them would bide,<br> But left the burning summer next to deal<br> With hearts of men, and hope from them to steal.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now came the time round even to the day<br> When Rhodope had made her journey vain<br> Unto the valley where the temple lay,<br> And now, too, when the morn was on the wane,<br> Before the homestead door she stood again,<br> For to the town she needs must go to bring,<br> For their poor household work, some needful thing.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with slow feet she crossed the threshold o&#146;er<br> With brow a little knitted, as if she<br> Dealt with some troublous thought, that oft before<br> Had mazed her mind: then no less, steadily<br> Through the fair day she went on toward the sea,<br> For by the port, and lying low adown,<br> Stretched out their unwalled simple market-town.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some mile of highway had she got to pace,<br> Ere she might reach the first house of the street<br> That led unto the lowly market-place;<br> So on she went, and still her eyes did meet<br> The elm-tree shade that flickered o&#146;er her feet. <A NAME="page_317"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 317</FONT></A><br> Though thronged beyond its wont the white way was,<br> With folk well clad, who toward the town did pass,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swiftly she went, till come half-way belike,<br> Then stayed her feet and looked up suddenly;<br> There by the way-side the hot sun did strike<br> Upon a patch of grass, whereon did lie<br> A grey old hound, and &#146;gainst an elm thereby<br> His master leaned, a shepherd older yet,<br> Whose deep-sunk eyes her eyes unwitting met.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith a knot of folk she had just passed<br> Passed her in turn, maidens and youths they were,<br> Blithe with their life and youth; on her they cast<br> Such looks as if they had a mind to jeer,<br> Yet held back, some by wonder, some by fear,<br> Went on a space until they deemed them free,<br> Then through the summer day outburst their glee.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her deep eyes followed them, and yet, indeed,<br> As images she saw them; there a space<br> Musing she stood, then turned, and at slow speed<br> Went back again to her abiding-place,<br> Just as the old man moved his puckered face<br> To speak some word to her; and so at last,<br> O&#146;er her own threshold inward her feet passed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to her sleeping-room she went, and knelt<br> Beside a chest, and raised the lid, and drew <A NAME="page_318"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 318</FONT></A><br> From out the dark where year-long it had dwelt,<br> Remembered yet the while, the precious shoe,<br> And dreamy over it awhile she grew,<br> Then set it in her bosom, and went forth,<br> Pondering o&#146;er what her fond desires were worth.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still folk thronged on the highway; as she went<br> Some fragment of their talk would reach her ear<br> Howso upon her dreams she was intent;<br> Of new-come men they spake, their ways and gear,<br> How glorious of array, how great they were,<br> How huge and fair their galley, that last eve<br> The little black-quayed haven did receive.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That talk of strange and great things raised at last<br> New and wild hopes in her, but none the less<br> Straightway unto her journey's end she passed,<br> And did what she must do, nor cared to guess<br> Why in the market-place all folk did press<br> Around a glitter as of steel and gold<br> That in the midst thereof she did behold.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, her work done, she gat her back again<br> Unto the market-place, and curiously<br> &#146;Gan eye the concourse, yea, at last, was fain<br> Unto the heart thereof to come anigh;<br> Her heart beat; strange she felt and knew not why,<br> As on she went, and still the wondering folk<br> To right and left before her beauty broke. <A NAME="page_319"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 319</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A temple midmost of the market-place,<br> Raised to the Mother of the Gods there stood,<br> An ancient house in guise of other days,<br> And e&#146;en amid that simple folk deemed rude;<br> Such as it was the country-folk thought good<br> To meet and talk there, o&#146;er such things as they<br> Found hard to deal with as day passed by day.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when she drew anigh its steps, thereon<br> She saw indeed a goodly company,<br> For there sat strange men, young and old, who shone<br> In such attire as scarce she thought could be,<br> And by these glittering folk from over sea<br> Were the land's fathers, and the chief-priest dight<br> To do a solemn sacrifice aright.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E&#146;en as she came into the foremost rank,<br> Bright gleamed the slayer's falchion in the sun,<br> And silently the rose-crowned heifer sank<br> Upon the time-worn pavement; yet not one<br> Of all the sea-farers might gaze upon<br> Victim or priest, for forth stood Rhodope<br> Lone on the steps, a glorious thing to see.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For on a tripod by the altar's side,<br> Gleaming, as that day year agone it gleamed,<br> The shoe her foot had pressed she now espied,<br> And o&#146;er her soul a sudden light there streamed,<br> While from her eager eyes such glory beamed, <A NAME="page_320"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 320</FONT></A><br> That all folk stared astonished, all must wait<br> For her first word as for the stroke of fate.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, there she stood, that all fair things did lack,<br> Clad in a gown of dark grey woollen stuff,<br> The wares she had just dealt for at her back,<br> And all about her homely, coarse, and rough,<br> Yet, since her beauty blessed them, good enough:<br> For, as a goddess wandering on the earth,<br> How might she deem earth's richest gauds of worth?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently, yet with no flush on her smooth cheek,<br> She mounted up the steps, and spake out clear:<br> "Perchance a match for yon fair thing ye seek<br> Ye seem to prize so much; it lieth here,<br> And both of them on this day was-a-year<br> Were on my feet. My father will be glad<br> Because great joy in them the old man had."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then rose a great shout up into the sky,<br> And in despite herself the blood would rise<br> Unto her cheek and brow, as quietly<br> From her white fragrant bosom, a world's prize,<br> She drew the mass of blazing &#146;broideries,<br> And laid it by its fellow, and her hand<br> Trembled, as there sun-litten she did stand.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then cried a grey-beard, clad in gems and gold:<br> "Praise to the Gods who do all things aright, <A NAME="page_321"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 321</FONT></A><br> And thus have given my weak eyes to behold<br> Now, at the end of life, so fair a sight,<br> Have given withal unto the worth and might<br> Of the great king so fair a mate as thee&#151;<br> How good, how good it is thine eyes to see!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was pale now, though never a word she spake,<br> And held her head, as though a crown it wore<br> And &#146;gan &#146;neath gold, and golden hair to ache<br> With new-born longings, fears unknown before,<br> And calmly her deep eyes the men passed o&#146;er<br> Who sat there marvelling; till the old man said:<br> "Wonder not overmuch, O glorious maid,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At all these things! The Gods who wrought thee thus,<br> And kept thee here apart from ill men's eyes<br> To show thee forth so much more marvellous,<br> Have led our hearts unto thee in this wise;<br> For the great king did solemn sacrifice<br> Unto the Gods well-nigh a year agone,<br> And in the bright sun bright the altar shone.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But e&#146;en as to its highest shot the flame,<br> And to the awful Gods our hearts did turn,<br> A cry from out the far blue sky there came,<br> And a bright thing &#146;twixt flame and sun did burn,<br> And some there were who said they could discern<br> An eagle, like a faint speck, far above<br> The altar, whereon lay this gift of love. <A NAME="page_322"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 322</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How this may be I know not, but the king<br> Trembled, and toward the altar stretched his hand,<br> And drew to him the strange-sent, fair-wrought thing,<br> And, thereon staring, a long while did stand,<br> And left the place, not giving such command<br> As he was wont, and still from that day forth<br> Took little heed of things once held of worth.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Silent and pale, and strange-eyed still he grew,<br> And yet said nought hereon for many days,<br> Until at last he bade us take this shoe<br> And diligently search in every place<br> That we might come to, till we saw the face<br> Of her whose foot had touched it. &#145;Certainly,<br> Whereso she is, she hath been wrought for me.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;'Whereso she is, and by what name men name<br> Her loveliness and love unknown: to now,<br> Young am I, and have heretofore had shame<br> To bend to love, e&#146;en as my folk bend low<br> Before my throne, but now my pride doth grow<br> As a quenched candle in a golden house,<br> And through the dark I wander timorous.'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We marvelled at his word, but deemed some God<br> Possessed his heart; but thenceforth constantly<br> Have we gone over the wide world, and trod<br> Rough ways enow, been tossed o&#146;er many a sea,<br> And dealt with many a lie, until to thee <A NAME="page_323"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 323</FONT></A><br> The Gods have brought us, O thou wondrous one!<br> That we might see thee ere our days are done."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah me!" she said, "what thing do ye demand?<br> Is it a little thing that I should go,<br> Leaving my people and my father's land, .<br> To wed some proud great man I do not know?<br> I look for no glad life; yea, it is so<br> That if a grain of love were left in me<br> In vain your keel had cleft our girdling sea.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to speak; I know what ye would say&#151;<br> &#151;That where I go, still I and love shall rule,<br> That where I go I bear about the day<br> Made golden by my beauty&#151;base and dull,<br> Mid hollow shows to strive with knave and fool,<br> With death, and nothing done, to end it all!<br> &#151;Yet fear ye not! for surely I shall fall</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where the Gods cast me, nor turn round about<br> To gaze on bygone time&#151;so it shall be<br> E&#146;en as ye will." They stared at her, in doubt<br> If her sweet lips had spoken; yea, and she<br> Flushed &#146;neath their eyes fixed on her wonderingly,<br> Wondering herself at the new fear, new scorn<br> That with beginning of new days was born.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they, abased before the rough-clad maid,<br> Now led her to an empty ivory chair, <A NAME="page_324"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 324</FONT></A><br> And each man knee unto the pavement laid,<br> And, unashamed, did reverence to her there;<br> And ever did she seem to grow more fair<br> Before their eyes, till fear arose in them<br> As they bent down to her rude garment's hem.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the rites unto the Gods went on,<br> While she sat musing on the wondrous tale;<br> And when all these at last were duly done,<br> They prayed her give command when they should sail;<br> She raised her face, grown quiet now and pale,<br> And said in a low voice: &#147;Today were best,<br> For here at least may I have nought of rest.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;The old is gone, the new is not yet come,<br> Familiar things with strange eyes I behold,<br> And nowhere now I seem to have a home.<br> But when I go from homespun unto gold,<br> My father and mother, poor folk bent and old,<br> Beaten by fortune, needs must go with me,<br> And share my new proud life beyond the sea.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;And since the old man loveth me too well,<br> And hitherto small joy from me hath gained,<br> Meet is it that my lips alone should tell<br> How all is changed, and weal that long hath waned<br> Is waxen now, and the cold rain that rained<br> Upon his life's grey day hath met the sun,<br> And blossoms spring from the dull earth and dun. <A NAME="page_325"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 325</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, O ye folk, midst whom my feet have dwelt,<br> And whom I leave now, if so be, that I<br> Hard anger in my heart at whiles have felt<br> &#146;Gainst things that pressed upon me wearily,<br> Yet now the kindness of time past draws nigh,<br> And ye will be my folk still, when I go<br> Unto a land where e&#146;en your name none know."</p>  
<p>Then, midst their marvelling silence, she arose,<br> And took her cast-down fardel up again,<br> And went her ways; and they, by whom all close<br> Her body passed, must tremble, and be fain<br> To think of common things to dull the pain<br> Of longing, as her lovely majesty,<br> Too sweet and strange for earth, brushed swiftly by.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet of earth she was, and as she went<br> Through the shrunk shadow to her old abode,<br> Fresh hope a new joy through her body sent,<br> The clear cold vision of her soul to cloud;<br> And less the striving world seemed like a load<br> To weary her, than a strange curious toy,<br> To solace life with foolish grief and joy.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still grew that hope in her, and when she carne<br> Unto the homestead, and her father met<br> Anigh the byre, then doubt, and fear, and shame,<br> Amid the joy of change did she forget,<br> As firm feet mid the loitering kine she set, <A NAME="page_326"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 326</FONT></A><br> And cried aloud, "O father, turn and gaze<br> On Fortune's friend, the Queen of glorious days!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and stared upon her glittering eyes<br> And godlike mien, and &#146;gan to speak, but she<br> Cried out, "The very Gods may call us wise,<br> For great days have they given to thee and me,<br> Things stranger than these meadows shall we see,<br> And thou shalt wonder that thou ere didst keep<br> These kine, as Ph&#156;bus erst Admetus' sheep!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then did she pour the whole tale out on him<br> Eager at first, but faltered to behold<br> How he fell trembling in his every limb;<br> Through the new fever that her heart did fold,<br> Again shame thrust its steely point and cold:<br> "Alas," she thought, "when all the tale is done,<br> Why go we thus alone beneath the sun?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to speak, and the words came at last;<br> "If thou art glad, then surely I am glad&#151;<br> &#151;And yet, we thought our evil time had passed;<br> Surely the days grew not so wholly bad!<br> Ah me, a growing hope of late I had<br> Of quiet days and sweet&#151;yet shame of me,<br> That I should dull the joy that gladdeth thee!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Daughter, thy bidding I will surely do,<br> And go with thee; nathless bethink thee yet, <A NAME="page_327"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 327</FONT></A><br> How yesterday shall seem full long ago,<br> When with to-morrow's dew the grass is wet.<br> Child, I will pray thee never to forget<br> This face of mine, this heart that loves thee well;<br> Let distance though, and time that sweet tale tell!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She cried: &#147;Ah, wilt thou have me lonelier<br> Than the Gods made me? As day passes day<br> The life of fear and hope that happened here,<br> Most oft no doubt shall seem full far away;<br> Yet be thou nigh, to be a scarce-felt stay<br> To my mazed steps, a green close fresh and sweet,<br> On life's hard way, to cool my weary feet.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will not take my bidding back; go thou,<br> And get thee ready swiftly to be gone.<br> The sails are flapping in the haven now,<br> And we depart before the clay is done.<br> O be thou glad, thou shalt not be alone!<br> Canst thou not see e&#146;en now how this my face<br> I softened to thee by the happy days?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said no more, but eyed her lovingly,<br> Upon his worn old face a trembling smile;<br> Then turned him toward the house with one great sigh,<br> And she was left alone a little while,<br> Her restlessness with strange dreams to beguile,<br> And though bright things those dreams did nowise lack,<br> Yet oft oft-conquered cold fear would come back. <A NAME="page_328"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 328</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But midst her thoughts from out the house there came<br> Her father and her mother, and she gazed<br> Upon the twain with something more than shame,<br> As she beheld what timid eyes and mazed<br> The goodwife to her queenly beauty raised,<br> And how with patient mien her father went,<br> On all her motions lovingly intent.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to the market-place passed on the three,<br> And though her grey gown only covered her,<br> Her mother bore some shreds of bravery<br> And clad her father was in scarlet gear,<br> Worn now and wretched, that he once did bear<br> When long ago at his rich board he sat,<br> And all that land's best cheer the glad guests gat.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as they stood there now, the simple folk,<br> Grown used unto the wonder of the tale,<br> Warmed with new joy, and into shouts outbroke;<br> The goodwife flushed, but the old man turned pale,<br> And gazed round helpless, his limbs seemed to fail<br> As though age pressed him sore; while Rhodope<br> Grew softer-eyed and spake majestically;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fain am I, lords, that we depart straightway;<br> For if a dream this is, I long full sore<br> E&#146;en in my dream to feel the wind-blown spray,<br> And hear the well-timed rolling of the oar,<br> And ere dark night behold the lessening shore <A NAME="page_329"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 329</FONT></A><br> From your dreamed dromond's deck&#151;so pass we on,<br> If e&#146;en so far as this my dream hath won."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said they: "All is ready in due wise,<br> E&#146;en as thou bad&#146;st, the ship has been warped round<br> And rideth toward the sea, and sacrifice<br> Has there been done, and goodly gifts been found<br> For this land's folk: but wilt thou not be crowned<br> And clad in fair array of gold, that we<br> May show thy beauty meetly to the sea?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay," said she, "in this lowly guise of mine<br> Let the king first behold me standing there<br> The Gods' gift, that his heart may more incline<br> Towards mine, if thus he note me strange and fair,<br> Grown up a queen, yet with no wondrous care<br> For what I should be. Make no more delay,<br> Low looks the sun upon the watery way."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So seaward now with these all people moved<br> Rejoicing, though belike they scarce knew why,<br> And Rhodope &#146;gan feel herself beloved;<br> And as the south wind breathed deliciously<br> O&#146;er flowers and sweet things, and the sun did die<br> Amid soft golden haze, her loveliness<br> She &#146;gan to feel, and all the world to bless.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her slim hand her father's hand she took,<br> Her red lips trembled, and her eyes were wet <A NAME="page_330"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 330</FONT></A><br> With tears that fell not; but the old man shook<br> As one who sees death; then a hand she set<br> Upon his shoulder, and said, "Long years yet,<br> With loving eyes these eyes shalt thou behold<br> Among the glimmer of fair things and gold."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nought he answered, and they came full soon<br> To where the gangway ran from out the ship<br> On to the black pier; white yet was the moon,<br> And the sun's rim nigh in the sea did dip,<br> And from the place where sky met ocean's lip,<br> Ran a great road of gold across the sea,<br> Where played the unquiet waves impatiently.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now was her foot upon the gangway plank;<br> Now over the green depths and oars blood-red<br> Fluttered her gown, and from the low green bank<br> Above the sea a cry came, as her head<br> Gleamed golden in the way that westward led,<br> And on the deck her feet were, but no more<br> She looked back then unto the peopled shore.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with one hand held back as if to take<br> Her father's hand, she went on toward the prow;<br> And there she stood, and watched the billows break,<br> Nor noted when men back the ropes did throw,<br> And scarce knew when the sea fell from the bow<br> And the ship moved, nor turned, till, cold and grey,<br> And darkling fast, the waste before her lay. <A NAME="page_331"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 331</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the last she turned on well-poised feet,<br> And gazed adown the twilight decks, and heard<br> The freshening wind about the cordage beat,<br> The master's and rough helmsman's answering word,<br> And all alone she felt now, and afeard,<br> In spite of all the folk who stood around,<br> Unto her lightest service straightly bound.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A terror seized her; down the deck she passed,<br> Her gown driven close against her, and her hair<br> Loosed by the driving wind; till at the mast<br> She stayed, and muttered: "Ah, he is not there!<br> And I, where am I? the dream seemed so fair<br> When it began; but now am I alone,<br> Waiting, I know not what, till life be done."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembling she drew her hand across her brow<br> As one who wakes; and then, grown calm once more,<br> She went with steady feet unto the prow,<br> And ran the line of reverent faces o&#146;er<br> With anxious eyes, and stayed at last before<br> The ancient grey-haired man, the chief of these,<br> And spoke amid the washing of the seas:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where is my father? I am fain to speak<br> Of many things with him, we two alone;<br> For mid these winds and waves my heart grows weak<br> With memory of the days for ever gone."<br> The moon was bright, the swaying lanterns shone <A NAME="page_332"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 332</FONT></A><br> On her pale face, and fluttering garment's hem&#151;<br> &#151;Each stared on each, and silence was on them.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And midst that silence a new lonely pain,<br> Like sundering death, smote on her, till he spoke:<br> &#147;O queen, what sayst thou? the old man was fain,<br> He told us, still to dwell among his folk;<br> He said, thou knew&#146;st he might not bear the yoke<br> Of strange eyes watching him&#151;what say I more,<br> Surely thou know&#146;st he never left the shore?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I deemed him wise and true: but give command<br> If so thou willest; certes no great thing<br> It is, in two hours space to make the land,<br> Though much the land-wind now is freshening."<br> One slender hand to the rough shroud did cling,<br> As her limbs failed; she raised the other one,<br> And moved her lips to bid the thing be done:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet no words came, she stood upright again,<br> And dropped her hand and said, "I strive with change,<br> I strive with death the Gods&#146; toy, but in vain:<br> No otherwise than thus might all be strange."<br> Therewith she turned, her unseeing eyes did range<br> Wide o&#146;er the tumbling waste of waters grey,<br> As swift the black ship went upon her way.</p>

<p>DARK night upon the cold still eve did fall<br> Amidst the tale, and now the fair guest-hall<br> Was lit with nought but firelight, as they sat,<br> Silent, soft-hearted, and compassionate<br> Midst their own flickering shadows; yet too old<br> They were, to talk about the story told,<br> Too old, and knew too well what each man thought,<br> And feared in any pleasure to be caught,<br> That hid a snare of sadness at its end.<br> So slowly did the tale's sweet sorrow blend<br> With their own quenched desires, and past regret,<br> And dear-loved follies they might scarce forget;<br> That in these latter days indeed, were grown<br> Nought but a tale, for others to bemoan,<br> Who had not learned with sorrow's self to deal;<br> Who had no need an hour of bliss to steal,<br> With trembling hands, from the dark treasury<br> Of time long unregarded, long gone by,<br> Where cobwebbed o&#146;er amid the dust it lay.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But these stole not, nor strove, from day to day<br> Enough of pleasure to their lot did fall<br> To stay them, that on death they should not call<br> With change or rest to end the weary tide;<br> Though careless now, his coming did they bide. <A NAME="page_334"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 334</FONT></A></p>

<p>SCARCE aught was left of autumn-tide to die<br> When next they met; the north-east wind rushed by<br> The house anigh the woods, wherein they were,<br> And in the oaks and hollies might they hear<br> Its roar grow greater with the dying morn:<br> A hard grey day it was, yet scarce forlorn,<br> Since scarcely aught of tender or of sweet<br> Was left the year, its ruggedness to meet.<br> Bare was the country-side of work and folk:<br> There from the hill-side stead straight out the smoke,<br> Over the climbing row of corn-ricks, sailed;<br> And few folk stirred; a blue-clad horseman hailed<br> A shepherd from the white way, little heard<br> &#146;Twixt ridge and hollow by November seared;<br> The ferryman stared long adown the road<br> That led unto his tottering thatched abode,<br> Ere the dark speck into a goodwife turned;<br> The smouldering weed-heap by the garden burned;<br> Side-long the plough beside the field-gate lay,<br> With no one nigh to. scare the birds away,<br> That twittered mid the scanty wisps of straw.<br> So round the fire the ancient folk did draw,<br> And, mid the day-dreams, that hung round about,<br> Rather beheld the wild-wood dim with doubt,<br> And twilight of the cloudy leafless tide, <A NAME="page_335"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 335</FONT></A><br> Than the scant-peopled fallow country-side,<br> Whose fields the woods hemmed in: the world grew old<br> Unto their eyes, and lacked house, field, and fold.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then spake a wanderer; "Long the tale I tell<br> Though in few years the deeds thereof befell,<br> In a strange land and barren, far removed<br> From southlands and their bliss; yet folk beloved,<br> Yearning for love, striving &#146;gainst change and hate,<br> Strong, uncomplaining, yet compassionate,<br> Have dwelt therein&#151;a strange and awful land<br> Where folk, as in the hollow of God's hand,<br> Beset with fearful things yet fearing nought,<br> Have lived their lives and wondrous deeds have wrought&#151;<br> Wild deeds, as other men. Yet these at least,<br> If death from but a rough and homely feast<br> Drew them away, lived not so full of care, .<br> They and their sons, but that their lives did bear<br> The fruit of deeds recorded. Bear with me<br> If I shall seem to hold this history<br> Of a few freemen of the farthest north,<br> A handful, as a thing of too much worth;<br> Because this Iceland was my fathers' home,<br> Nay, somewhat of the selfsame stock they come<br> As these I tell of: know withal that we<br> Have ever deemed this tale as true to be,<br> As though those very Dwellers in Laxdale, <A NAME="page_336"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 336</FONT></A><br> Risen from the dead had told us their own tale;<br> Who for the rest while yet they dwelt on earth<br> Wearied no God with prayers for more of mirth<br> Than dying men have; nor were ill-content<br> Because no God beside their sorrow went<br> Turning to flowery sward the rock-strewn way,<br> Weakness to strength, or darkness into day.<br> Therefore, no marvels hath my tale to tell,<br> But deals with such things as men know too well;<br> All that I have herein your hearts to move,<br> Is but the seed and fruit of bitter love."</p>
