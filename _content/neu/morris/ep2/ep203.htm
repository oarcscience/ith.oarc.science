<p><A NAME="page_5"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 5</FONT></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE DEATH OF PARIS.</h3>  <h4 align="center">ARGUMENT.</h4>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">PARIS the son of Priam was wounded by one of the poisoned arrows of Hercules that Philoctetes bore to the siege of Troy; wherefore he had himself borne up into Ida that he might see the nymph &#140;none, whom he once had loved, because she, who knew many secret things, alone could heal him: but when he had seen her and spoken with her, she would deal with the matter in no wise, wherefore Paris died of that hurt.</FONT></p>  
<p>IN the last month of Troy's beleaguerment,<br> When both sides, waiting for some God's great hand,<br> But seldom o&#146;er the meads the war-shout sent,<br> Yet idle rage would sometimes drive a band<br> From town or tent about Troy-gate to stand<br> All armed, and there to bicker aimlessly;<br> And so at least the weary time wore by.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such a fight, when wide the arrows flew,<br> And little glory fell to any there,<br> And nought there seemed for a stout man to do,<br> Rose Philoctetes from the ill-roofed lair<br> That hid his rage, and crept out into air, <A NAME="page_6"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 6</FONT></A><br> And strung his bow, and slunk down to the fight,<br> &#146;Twixt rusty helms, and, shields that once were bright.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even as he reached the foremost rank,<br> A glimmer as of polished steel and gold<br> Amid the war-worn Trojan folk, that shrank<br> To right and left, his fierce eyes could behold;<br> He heard a shout, as if one man were bold<br> About the streams of Simoeis that day&#151;<br> One heart still ready to play out the play.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith he heard a mighty bowstring twang,<br> And a shaft screamed &#146;twixt hostile band and band,<br> And close beside him fell, with clash and clang,<br> A well-tried warrior from the Cretan land,<br> And rolled in dust, clutching with desperate hand<br> At the gay feathers of the shaft that lay<br> Deep in his heart, well silenced from that day.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then of the Greeks did man look upon man,<br> While Philoctetes from his quiver drew<br> A dreadful shaft, and through his fingers ran<br> The dull-red feathers; of strange steel and blue<br> The barbs were, such as archer never knew,<br> But black as death the thin-forged bitter point,<br> That with the worm's blood fate did erst anoint.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook the shaft, and notched it, and therewith<br> Forth from the Trojans rang that shout again, <A NAME="page_7"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 7</FONT></A><br> Whistled the arrow, and a Greek did writhe<br> Once more upon the earth in his last pain;<br> While the grey clouds, big with the threat of rain,<br> Parted a space, and on the Trojans shone,<br> And struck a glory from that shining one.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Philoctetes scowled, and cried, "O Fate,<br> I give thee this, thy strong man gave to me.<br> Do with it as thou wilt!&#151;let small or great<br> E&#146;en as thou wilt before its black point be!<br> Late grows the year, and stormy is the sea,<br> The oars lie rotten by the gunwales now<br> That nevermore a Grecian surf shall know."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spake and drew the string with careless eyes,<br> And, as the shaft flew forth, he turned about<br> And tramped back slowly, noting in no wise<br> How from the Greeks uprose a joyous shout,<br> And from the Trojan host therewith brake out<br> Confused clamour, and folk cried the name<br> Of him wherethrough the weary struggle came,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paris the son of Priam! then once more<br> O&#146;erhead of leaguer and beleaguered town<br> Grey grew the sky, a cold sea-wind swept o&#146;er<br> The ruined plain, and the small rain drove down,<br> While slowly underneath that chilling frown<br> Parted the hosts; sad Troy into its gates,<br> Greece to its tents, and waiting on the fates. <A NAME="page_8"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>NEXT day the seaward-looking gates none swung<br> Back on their hinges, whatso Greek might fare,<br> With seeming-careless mien, and bow unstrung,<br> Anigh them; whatso rough-voiced horn might dare<br> With well-known notes, the war-worn warders there;<br> Troy slept amid its nightmares through the day,<br> And dull with waking dreams the leaguer lay.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet in the streets did man say unto man,<br> "Hector is dead, and Troilus is dead;<br> &AElig;neas turneth toward the waters wan;<br> In his fair house Antenor hides his head;<br> Fast from the tree of Troy the boughs are shred;<br> And now this Paris, now this joyous one,<br> Is the cry cried that biddeth him begone?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the morrow's dawn, ere yet the sun<br> Had shone athwart the mists of last night's rain,<br> And shown the image of the Spotless One<br> Unto the tents and hovels of the plain<br> Whose girth of war she long had made all vain,<br> From out a postern looking towards the north<br> A little band of silent men went forth.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in their midst a litter did they bear<br> Whereon lay one with linen wrapped around,<A NAME="page_9"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 9</FONT></A><br> Whose wan face turned unto the fresher air<br> As though a little pleasure he had found<br> Amidst of pain; some dreadful, torturing wound<br> The man endured belike, and as a balm<br> Was the fresh morn, with all its rest and calm,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the weary tossing of the night<br> And close dim-litten chamber, whose dusk seemed<br> Labouring with whispers fearful of the light,<br> Confused with images of dreams long dreamed,<br> Come back again, now that the lone torch gleamed<br> Dim before eyes that saw nought real as true<br> To vex the heart that nought of purpose knew.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the late-passed night in e&#146;en such wise<br> Had Paris lain. What time, like years of life,<br> Had passed before his weary heart and eyes!<br> What hopeless, nameless longings! what wild strife<br> &#146;Gainst nought for nought, with wearying changes rife,<br> Had he gone through, till in the twilight grey<br> They bore him through the cold deserted way.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mocking and strange the streets looked now, most meet<br> For a dream's ending, for a vain life's end;<br> While sounded his strong litter-bearers' feet,<br> Like feet of men who through Death's country wend<br> Silent, for fear lest they should yet offend<br> The grim King satisfied to let them go,<br> Hope bids them hurry, fear's chain makes them slow. <A NAME="page_10"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 10</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In feverish doze he thought of bygone days,<br> When love was soft, life strong, and a sweet name,<br> The first sweet name that led him down love's ways,<br> Unbidden ever to his fresh lips came;<br> Half witting would he speak it, and for shame<br> Flush red, and think what folk would deem thereof<br> If they might know &#140;none was his love.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, &#140;none no more love of his,<br> He worn with war and passion&#151;must he pray,<br> "O thou, I loved and love not, life and bliss<br> Lie in thine hands to give or take away;<br> O heal me, hate me not! think of the day<br> When as thou thinkest still, e&#146;en so I thought,<br> That all the world without thy love was nought."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, he was borne forth such a prayer to make,<br> For she alone of all the world, they said,<br> The thirst of that dread poison now might slake,<br> For midst the ancient wise ones nurtured<br> On peaceful Ida, in the lore long dead,<br> Lost to the hurrying world, right wise she was,<br> Mighty to bring most wondrous things to pass.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the world worth the minute of that prayer<br> If yet her love, despised and cast aside,<br> Should so shine forth that she should heal him there?<br> He knew not and he recked not; fear and pride<br> &#146;Neath Helen's kiss and Helen's tears had died, <A NAME="page_11"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 11</FONT></A><br> And life was love, and love too strong that he<br> Should catch at Death to save him misery.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, with soul drifting down the stream of love,<br> He let them bear him through the fresh fair morn,<br> From out Troy-gates; and no more now he strove<br> To battle with the wild dreams, newly born<br> From that past night of toil and pain forlorn;<br> No farewell did he mutter &#146;neath his breath<br> To failing Troy, no eyes he turned toward death.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Troy dwindled now behind them, and the way<br> That round about the feet of Ida wound,<br> They left; and up a narrow vale, that lay,<br> Grassy and soft betwixt the pine-woods bound,<br> 'They went, and ever gained the higher ground,<br> For as a trench the little valley was<br> To catch the runnels that made green its grass.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now ere that green vale narrowed to an end,<br> Blocked by a shaly slip thrust bleak and bare<br> From the dark pine-wood's edge, as men who wend<br> Upon a well-known way, they turned them there;<br> And through the pine-wood's dusk began to fare<br> By blind ways, till all noise of bird and wind<br> Amid that odorous night was left behind.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in meanwhile deepened the languid doze<br> That lay on Paris into slumber deep, <A NAME="page_12"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 12</FONT></A><br> O&#146;er his unconscious heart, and eyes shut close,<br> The image of that very place &#146;gan creep,<br> And twelve years younger in his dreamful sleep,<br> Light-footed, through the awful wood he went,<br> With beating heart, on lovesome thoughts intent.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreaming, he went, till thinner and more thin,<br> And bright with growing day, the pine-wood grew,<br> Then to an open, rugged space did win;<br> Whence a close beech-wood was he passing through,<br> Whose every tall white stem full well he knew;<br> Then seemed to stay awhile for loving shame,<br> When to the brow of the steep bank he came,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where still the beech-trunks o&#146;er the mast-strewn ground<br> Stood close, and slim and tall, but hid not quite<br> A level grassy space they did surround<br> On every side save one, that to the light<br> Of the clear western sky, cold now, but bright,<br> Was open, and the thought of the far sea,<br> Toward which a small brook tinkled merrily.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Him seemed he lingered there, then stepped adown<br> With troubled heart into the soft green place,<br> And up the eastmost of the beech-slopes brown<br> He turned about a lonesome, anxious face,<br> And stood to listen for a little space<br> If any came, but nought he seemed to hear <A NAME="page_13"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 13</FONT></A><br> Save the brook's babble, and the beech-leaves&#146; stir.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he dreamed great longing o&#146;er him came;<br> Too great, too bitter of those days to be<br> Long past, when love was born amidst of shame;<br> He dreamed that, as he gazed full eagerly<br> Into the green dusk between tree and tree,<br> His trembling hand slid down the horn to take<br> Wherewith he erst was wont his herd to wake.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembling, he set it to his lips, and first<br> Breathed gently through it; then strained hard to blow,<br> For dumb, dumb was it grown, and no note burst<br> From its smooth throat; and ill thoughts poisoned now<br> The sweetness of his dream; he murmured low,<br> "Ah! dead and gone, and ne&#146;er to come again;<br> Ah, past away! ah, longed for long in vain!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lost love, sweet Helen, come again to me!"<br> Therewith he dreamed he fell upon the ground<br> And hid his face, and wept out bitterly,<br> But woke with fall and torturing tears, and found<br> He lay upon his litter, and the sound<br> Of feet departing from him did he hear,<br> And rustling of the last year's leaves anear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the self-same place he lay indeed,<br> Weeping and sobbing, and scarce knowing why; <A NAME="page_14"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 14</FONT></A><br> His hand clutched hard the horn that erst did lead<br> The dew-lapped neat round Ida merrily;<br> He strove to raise himself, he strove to cry<br> That name of Helen once, but then withal<br> Upon him did the load of memory fall.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quiet he lay a space, while o&#146;er him drew<br> The dull, chill cloud of doubt and sordid fear,<br> As now he thought of what he came to do,<br> And what a dreadful minute drew anear;<br> He shut his eyes, and now no more could hear<br> His litter-bearers' feet; as lone he felt<br> As though amid the outer wastes he dwelt.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid that fear most feeble, nought and vain<br> His life and love seemed; with a dreadful sigh<br> He raised his arm, and soul's and body's pain<br> Tore at his heart with new-born agony<br> As a thin quavering note; a ghost-like cry<br> Rang from the long unused lips of the horn,<br> Spoiling the sweetness of the happy morn.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He let the horn fall down upon his breast<br> And lie there, and his hand fell to his side;<br> And there indeed his body seemed to rest,<br> But restless was his soul, and wandered wide<br> Through a dim maze of lusts unsatisfied;<br> Thoughts half thought out, and words half said, and deeds <A NAME="page_15"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 15</FONT></A><br> Half done, unfruitful, like o&#146;er-shadowed weeds.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes were shut now, and his dream's hot tears<br> Were dry upon his cheek; the sun grown high<br> Had slain the wind, when smote upon his ears<br> A sudden rustling in the beech-leaves dry;<br> Then came a pause; then footsteps drew anigh<br> O&#146;er the deep grass; he shuddered, and in vain<br> He strove to turn, despite his burning pain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then through his half-shut eyes he seemed to see<br> A woman drawing near, and held his breath,<br> And clutched at the white linen eagerly,<br> And felt a greater fear than fear of death,<br> A greater pain than that love threateneth,<br> As soft low breathing o&#146;er his head he heard,<br> And thin fine linen raiment gently stirred.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then spoke a sweet voice close, ah, close to him!<br> "Thou sleepest, Paris? would that I could sleep!<br> On the hill-side do I lay limb to limb,<br> And lie day-long watching the shadows creep<br> And change, till day is gone, and night is deep,<br> Yet sleep not ever, wearied with the thought<br> Of all a little lapse of time has brought.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sleep, though thou calledst me! yet &#146;mid thy dream<br> Hearken, the while I tell about my life,<br> The life I led, while &#146;mid the steely gleam <A NAME="page_16"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 16</FONT></A><br> Thou wert made happy with the joyous strife;<br> Or in the soft arms of the Greek king's wife<br> Wouldst still moan out that day had come too soon,<br> Calling the dawn the glimmer of the moon.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake not, wake not, before the tale is told!<br> Not long to tell, the tale of those ten years!<br> A gnawing pain that never groweth old,<br> A pain that shall not be washed out by tears;<br> A dreary road the weary foot-sole wears,<br> Knowing no rest, but going to and fro,<br> Treading it harder &#146;neath the weight of woe.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No middle, no beginning, and no end;<br> No staying place, no thought of anything,<br> Bitter or sweet, with that one thought to blend;<br> No least joy left that I away might fling<br> And deem myself grown great; no hope to cling<br> About me, nought but dull, unresting pain,<br> That made all memory sick, all striving vain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou&#151;hast thou thought thereof, perchance anights<br> &#151;In early dawn, and shuddered, and then said,<br> 'Alas, poor soul! yet bath she had delights,<br> For none are wholly hapless but the dead.'<br> Liar! O liar! my woe upon thine head,<br> My agony that nought can take away!<br> Awake, arise, O traitor, unto day!" <A NAME="page_17"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 17</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her voice rose as she spoke, till loud and shrill<br> It rang about the place; but when at last<br> She ended, and the echoes from the hill,<br> Woeful and wild, back o&#146;er the place were cast<br> From her lost love a little way she passed<br> Trembling, and looking round as if afeared<br> At those ill sounds that through the morn she heard.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then still she stood, her clenched hands slim and white<br> Relaxed, her drawn brow smoothed; with a great sigh<br> Her breast heaved, and she muttered: "Ere the light<br> Of yesterday had faded from the sky<br> I knew that he would seek me certainly;<br> And, knowing it, yet feigned I knew it not,<br> Or with what hope, what hope my heart was hot.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That tumult in my breast I might not name&#151;<br> Love should I call it?&#151;nay, my life was love<br> And pain these ten years&#151;should I call it shame?<br> What shame my weary waiting might reprove<br> After ten years?&#151;or pride?&#151;what pride could move<br> After ten years this heart within my breast?<br> Alas! I lied&#151;I lied, and called it rest.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I called it rest, and wandered through the night;<br> Upon my river's flowery bank I stood,<br> And thought its hurrying changing black and white<br> Stood still beneath the moon, that hill and wood <A NAME="page_18"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 18</FONT></A><br> Were moving round me, and I deemed it good<br> The world should change so, deemed it good, that day<br> For ever into night had passed away.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And still I wandered through the night, and still<br> Things changed, and changed not round me, and the day&#151;<br> This day wherein I am, had little will<br> With dreadful truth to drive the night away&#151;<br> God knows if for its coming I did pray!<br> God knows if at the last in twilight-tide<br> My hope&#151;my hope undone I more might hide."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then looked she toward the litter as she spake,<br> And slowly drew anigh it once again,<br> And from her worn tried heart there did outbreak<br> Wild sobs and weeping, shameless of its pain,<br> Till as the storm of passion &#146;gan to wane<br> She looked and saw the shuddering misery<br> Wherein her love of the old days did lie.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still she wept on, but gentler now withal,<br> And passed on till above the bier she stood,<br> Watching the well-wrought linen rise and fall<br> Beneath his faltering breath, and still her blood<br> Ran fiery hot with thoughts of ill and good,<br> Pity and scorn, and love and hate, as she,<br> Half dead herself, gazed on his misery.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last she spake: "This tale I told e&#146;en now, <A NAME="page_19"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 19</FONT></A><br> Know&#146;st thou &#146;mid dreams what woman suffered this?<br> Canst thou not dream of the old days, and how<br> Full oft thy lips would say &#146;twixt kiss and kiss<br> That all of bliss was not enough of bliss<br> My loveliness and kindness to reward,<br> That for thy Love the sweetest life was hard?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea, Paris, have I not been kind to thee?<br> Did I not live thy wishes to fulfil?<br> Wert thou not happy when thou lovedst me,<br> What dream then did we have of change or ill?<br> Why must thou needs change? I am unchanged still;<br> I need no more than thee&#151;what needest thou<br> But that we might be happy, yea e&#146;en now?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened hollow eyes and looked on her,<br> And stretched a trembling hand out; ah, who knows<br> With what strange mingled look of hope and fear,<br> Of hate and love, their eyes met! Come so close<br> Once more, that everything they now might lose<br> Amid the flashing out of that old fire,<br> The short-lived uttermost of all desire.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spake not, shame and other love there lay<br> Too heavy on him; but she spake again:<br> "E&#146;en now at the beginning of the day,<br> Weary with hope and fear and restless pain,<br> I said&#151;Alas, I said, if all be vain<br> And he will have no pity, yet will I <A NAME="page_20"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 20</FONT></A><br> Have pity&#151;how shall kindness e&#146;er pass by?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drew his hand aback, and laid it now<br> Upon the swathings of his wound, but she<br> Set her slim hand upon her knitted brow<br> And gazed on him with bright eyes eagerly;<br> Nor cruel looked her lips that once would be<br> So kind, so longed for: neither spake awhile,<br> Till in her face there shone a sweet strange smile.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She touched him not, but yet so near she came<br> That on his very face he felt her breath;<br> She whispered, "Speak! thou wilt not speak for shame,<br> I will not grant for love, and grey-winged Death<br> Meanwhile above our folly hovereth;<br> Speak! was it not all false? is it not done?<br> Is not the dream dreamed out, the dull night gone?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hearkenest thou, Paris? O look kind on me!<br> I hope no more indeed, but couldst thou turn<br> Kind eyes to me, then much for me and thee<br> Might love do yet. Doth not the old fire burn?<br> Doth not thine heart for words of old days yearn?<br> Canst thou not say&#151;Alas, what wilt thou say,<br> Since I have put by hope for many a day?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Paris, I hope no more, yet while ago&#151;<br> Take it not ill if I must needs say this&#151;<br> A while ago I cried; Ah! no, no, no! <A NAME="page_21"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 21</FONT></A><br> It is no love at all, this love of his,<br> He loves her not, I it was had the bliss<br> Of being the well-beloved&#151;dead is his love,<br> For surely none but I his heart may move."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wept still; but his eyes grew wild and strange<br> With that last word, and harder his face grew<br> Though her tear-blinded eyes saw not the change.<br> Long beat about his heart false words and true,<br> A veil of strange thought he might not pierce through,<br> Of hope he might not name, clung round about<br> His wavering heart, perplexed with death and doubt.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then trembling did he speak: "I love thee still,<br> Surely I love thee." But a dreadful pain<br> Shot through his heart, and strange presage of ill,<br> As like the ceasing of the summer rain<br> Her tears stopped, and she drew aback again,<br> Silent a moment, till a bitter cry<br> Burst from her lips grown white with agony.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A look of pity came across his face<br> Despite his pain and horror, and her eyes<br> Saw it, and changed, and for a little space<br> Panting she stood, as one checked by surprise<br> Amidst of passion; then in tender wise,<br> Kneeling, she &#146;gan the bandages undo<br> That hid the place the bitter shaft tore through.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then when the wound and his still face and white <A NAME="page_22"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 22</FONT></A><br> Lay there before her, she &#146;gan tremble sore,<br> For images of hope and past delight,<br> Not to be named once, &#146;gan her heart flit o&#146;er;<br> Blossomed the longing in her heart, and bore<br> A dreadful thought of uttermost despair,<br> That all if gained would be no longer fair.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dull low words she spake: "Yea, so it is,<br> That thou art near thy death, and this thy wound<br> I yet may heal, and give thee back what bliss<br> The ending of thy life may yet surround:<br> Mock not thyself with hope! the Trojan ground<br> Holds tombs, not houses now, all Gods are gone<br> From out your temples but cold Death alone.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lo, if I heal thee, and thou goest again<br> Back unto Troy, and she, thy new love, sees<br> Thy lovesome body freed from all its pain,<br> And yet awhile amid the miseries<br> Of Troy ye twain lie loving, well at ease,<br> Yet &#146;midst of this while she is asking thee<br> What kind soul made thee whole and well to be,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And thou art holding back my name with lies,<br> And thinking, maybe, Paris, of this face<br> E&#146;en then the Greekish flame shall sear your eyes,<br> The clatter of the Greeks fill all the place,<br> While she, my woe, the ruin of thy race,<br> Looking toward changed days, a new crown, shall stand, <A NAME="page_23"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 23</FONT></A><br> Her fingers trembling in her husband's hand.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou I called love once, wilt thou die e&#146;en thus,<br> Ruined &#146;midst ruin, ruining, bereft<br> Of name and honour? O love, piteous<br> That but for this were all the hard things cleft<br> That lay &#146;twixt us and love; till nought was left<br> &#146;Twixt thy lips and my lips! O hard that we<br> Were once so full of all felicity!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O love, O Paris, know&#146;st thou this of me<br> That in these hills e&#146;en such a name I have<br> As being akin to a divinity;<br> And lightly may I slay and lightly save;<br> Nor know I surely if the peaceful grave<br> Shall ever hide my body dead&#151;behold,<br> Have ten long years of misery made me old?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly she laughed; and rising wearily<br> Stood by him in the fresh and sunny morn;<br> The image of his youth and faith gone by<br> She seemed to be, for one short minute born<br> To make his shamed lost life seem more forlorn;<br> He shut his eyes and moaned, but once again<br> She knelt beside him, and the weary pain</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deepened upon her face. "Hearken!" she said,<br> "Death is anear thee; is then death so ill<br> With me anigh thee&#151;since Troy is as dead, <A NAME="page_24"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 24</FONT></A><br> Ere many tides the Xanthus' mouth shall fill,<br> And thou art reft of her that harmed me still,<br> Whatso may change&#151;shall I heal thee for this,<br> That thou may&#146;st die more mad for her last kiss?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gazed at him with straining eyes; and he&#151;<br> Despite himself love touched his dying heart,<br> And from his eyes desire flashed suddenly,<br> And o&#146;er his wan face the last blood did start<br> As with soft love his close-shut lips &#146;gan part.<br> She laughed out bitterly, and said, "Why then<br> Must I needs call thee falsest of all men,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Seeing thou liest not to save thy life?&#151;<br> Yee listen once again&#151;fair is this place<br> That knew not the beginning of the strife<br> And recks not of its end&#151;and this my face,<br> This body thou wouldst day-long once embrace<br> And deem thyself right happy&#151;thine it is,<br> Thine only, Paris, shouldst thou deem it bliss."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked into her eyes, and deemed he saw<br> A strange and awful look a-gathering there,<br> And sick scorn at her quivering fine lip draw;<br> Yet trembling he stretched out his hand to her,<br> Although self-loathing and strange hate did tear<br> His heart that Death made cold, e&#146;en as he said,<br> "Whatso thou wilt shall be remembered;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whatso thou wilt, O love, shall be forgot,&#151; <A NAME="page_25"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 25</FONT></A><br> It may be I shall love thee as of old."<br> As thunder laughs she laughed&#151;"Nay, touch me not!<br> Touch me not, fool!" she cried, "Thou grow&#146;st a-cold,<br> And I am Death, Death, Death!&#151;the tale is told<br> Of all thy days! of all those joyous days<br> When thinking nought of me thou garneredst praise.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Turn back again, and think no more of me!<br> I am thy Death! woe for thy happy days!<br> For I must slay thee; ah, my misery!<br> Woe for the God-like wisdom thou wouldst praise!<br> Else I my love to life again might raise<br> A minute, ah, a minute! and be glad<br> While on my lips thy blessing lips I had!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would God that it were yesterday again;<br> Would God the red sun had died yester-eve,<br> And I were no more hapless now than then!<br> Would God that I could say, and not believe,<br> As yesterday, that years past hope did leave<br> My cold heart&#151;that I lived a death in life&#151;<br> Ah! then within my heart was yet a strife!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But now, but now, is all come to an end&#151;<br> Nay, speak not; think not of me! think of her<br> Who made me this; and back unto her wend,<br> Lest her lot, too, should be yet heavier!<br> I will depart for fear thou diest here,<br> Lest I should see thy woeful ghost forlorn <A NAME="page_26"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 26</FONT></A><br> Here wandering ever &#146;twixt the night and morn.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&#151;O heart grown wise, wilt thou not let me go?<br> Will ye be never satisfied, O eyes,<br> With gazing on my misery and my woe?<br> O foolish, quivering heart, now grown so wise,<br> What folly is it that from out thee cries<br> To be all close to him once more, once more<br> Ere yet the dark stream cleaveth shore from shore?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her voice was a wail now, with quivering hand<br> At her white raiment did she clutch and tear<br> Unwitting, as she rose up and did stand<br> Bent over his wide eyes and pale face, where<br> No torturing hope was left, no pain, or fear;<br> For Death's cold rest was gathering fast on him,<br> And toward his heart crept over foot and limb.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while she stood, and spake no word,<br> But hung above him, with white heaving breast,<br> And moaning still as moans the grey-winged bird<br> In autumn-tide o&#146;er his forgotten nest;<br> And then her hands about her throat she pressed,<br> As though to keep a cry back, then stooped down<br> And set her face to his, while spake her moan:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O love, O cherished more than I can tell,<br> Through years of woe, O love, my life and bane,<br> My joy and grief, farewell, farewell, farewell! <A NAME="page_27"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 27</FONT></A><br> Forgetfulness of grief I yet may gain;<br> In some wise may come ending to my pain;<br> It may be yet the Gods will have me glad!<br> Yet, love, I would that thee and pain I had!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas! it may not be, it may not be,<br> The falling blossom of the late spring-tide<br> Shall hang a golden globe upon the tree<br> When through the vale the mists of autumn glide:<br> Yet would, O Love, with thee I might abide.<br> Now, now that restful death is drawing nigh&#151;<br> Farewell, farewell, how good it is to die!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O strange, O strange, when on his lips once more<br> Her lips were laid! O strange that he must die<br> Now, when so clear a vision had come o&#146;er<br> His failing heart, and keenest memory<br> Had shown him all his changing life passed by;<br> And what he was, and what he might have been,<br> Yea, and should be, perchance, so clear were seen!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, then were all things laid within the scale,<br> Pleasure and lust, love and desire of fame,<br> Kindness, and hope, and folly&#151;all the tale<br> Told in a moment, as across him came<br> That sudden flash, bright as the lightning-flame,<br> Showing the wanderer on the waste how he<br> Has gone astray &#146;mid dark and misery.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, and her face upon his dying face <A NAME="page_28"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 28</FONT></A><br> That the sun warmed no more! that agony<br> Of dying love, wild with the tale of days<br> Long past, and strange with hope that might not be&#151;<br> All was gone now, and what least part had he<br> In Love at all, and why was life all gone?<br> Why must he meet the eyes of death alone?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, for she and ruth had left him there;<br> Alone, because the ending of the strife<br> He knew, well taught by death, drew surely near;<br> Alone, for all those years with pleasure rife<br> Should be a tale &#146;mid Helen's coming life,<br> And she and all the world should go its ways,<br> &#146;Midst other troubles, other happy days.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet how was it with him? As if death<br> Strove yet with struggling life and love in vain,<br> With eyes grown deadly bright and rattling breathy<br> He raised himself; while wide his blood did stain<br> The linen fair, and seized the horn again,<br> And blew thereon a wild and shattering blast<br> Ere from his hand afar the thing he cast.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as a man who in a failing fight<br> For a last onset gathers suddenly<br> All soul and strength, he faced the summer light,<br> And from his lips broke forth a mighty cry<br> Of "Helen, Helen, Helen!"&#151;yet the sky<br> Changed not above his cast-back golden head,<br> And merry was the world though he was dead. <A NAME="page_29"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 29</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>BUT now when every echo was as still<br> As were the lips of Paris, once more came<br> The litter-bearers down the beech-clad hill<br> And stood about him crying out his name,<br> Lamenting for his beauty and his fame,<br> His love, his kindness, and his merry heart,<br> That still would thrust ill days and thoughts apart.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homeward they bore him through the dark woods&#146; gloom<br> With heavy hearts presaging nothing good;<br> And when they entered Troy again, a tomb<br> For them and theirs it seemed.&#151;Long has it stood,<br> But now indeed the labour and the blood,<br> The love, the patience, and good-heart are vain&#151;<br> The Greeks may have what yet is left to gain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>I CANNOT tell what crop may clothe the hills,<br> The merry hills Troy whitened long ago&#151;<br> Belike the sheaves, wherewith the reaper fills<br> His yellow wain, no whit the weaker grow<br> For that past harvest-tide of wrong and woe;<br> Belike the tale, wept over otherwhere,<br> Of those old days is clean forgotten there. <A NAME="page_30"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 30</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>ALAS too short seemed to those ancient men<br> The little span of threescore years and ten,<br> Too hard, too bitter, the dull years of life<br> Beset at best with many a care and strife<br> To bear withal Love's torment, and the toils<br> Wherewith the days of youth and joy he spoils;<br> Since e&#146;en so God makes equal Eld and Youth<br> Tormenting Youth with lies and Eld with truth;<br> Well-nigh they blamed the singer too, that he<br> Must needs draw pleasure from men's misery;<br> Nathless a little even they must feel<br> How time and tale a long-past woe will heal,<br> And make a melody of grief, and give<br> Joy to the world that whoso dies shall live.<br> Moreover, good it was for them to note<br> The slim hand set unto the changing throat,<br> The lids down drooped to hide the passionate eyes<br> Whereto the sweet thoughts all unbid would rise;<br> The bright-cheeked shame, the conscious mouth as love<br> Within the half-hid gentle breast &#146;gan move,<br> Like a swift-opening flower beneath the sun;<br> The sigh and half frown as the tale was done,<br> And thoughts uncertain, hard to grasp, did flit<br> &#146;Twixt the beginning and the end of it&#151;<br> And to their ancient eyes it well might seem. <A NAME="page_31"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 31</FONT></A><br> Lay tale in tale, as dream within a dream,<br> Untold now the beginning, and the end<br> Not to be heard by those whose feet should wend<br> Long ere that tide through the dim ways of death.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the sun grew dull, the south wind's breath<br> Ruffled the stream, and spake within the trees<br> Of rain beyond the hills; the images<br> The tale wrought changed with the changed deadening day,<br> Till dim they grew and vanished quite away. <A NAME="page_32"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 32</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>NOW when September drew unto its end,<br> Unto the self-same place those men did wend<br> Where last they feasted; and the autumn day<br> Was so alike to that one passed away,<br> That, but for silence of the close stripped bare,<br> And absence of the merry folk and fair,<br> Whose feet the deep grass, making haste to grow<br> Before the winter, minded nothing now<br> But for the thinned and straightened boughs, well freed<br> Of golden fruit; the vine-stocks that did need<br> No pruning more, ere eager man and maid<br> Brown fingers on the dusty bunches laid&#151;<br> But for these matters, they might even deem<br> That they had slept awhile and dreamed a dream,<br> And woke up weary in the self-same place.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now as each man saw his fellow's face<br> They &#146;gan to smile, beholding this same thought<br> Each in the other's eyes:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Or all is nought<br> Whereof I think," at last a wanderer said,<br> "Or of my tale shall ye be well apaid;<br> Meet is it for this silent company<br> Sitting here musing, well content to see<br> The shadows changing, as the sun goes by:<br> A dream it is, friends, and no history <A NAME="page_33"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 33</FONT></A><br> Of men who ever lived; so blame me nought<br> If wondrous things together there are brought,<br> Strange to our waking world&#151;yet as in dreams<br> Of known things still we dream, whatever gleams<br> Of unknown light may make them strange, so here<br> Our dreamland story holdeth such things dear<br> And such things loathed, as we do; else, indeed,<br> Were all its marvels nought to help our need.</p>
