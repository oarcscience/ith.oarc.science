<p align="center"><i>Kiartan back in Iceland; Refna comes into the Tale</i>.</p>  
<p>KIARTAN and K&aacute;lf in Burgfirth came aland<br> And raised their tents anigh unto the strand,<br> As in the summer-tide the fashion was<br> Of mariners, the while the news did pass<br> That they were come out, through the country-side,<br> And there awhile that summer would abide.<br> Now when to Herdholt did that tidings come,<br> Olaf and all his sons were gone from home:<br> So Kiartan saw them not at first, among<br> The folk that to the newcomers did throng;<br> Amidst the first of whom, he, none the less, <A NAME="page_426"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 426</FONT></A><br> Noted his friend Gudmund of Asbiornsness,<br> Who to his sister Thurid now was wed,<br> And brought her with him; with all goodlihead<br> He greeted them, yet Kiartan deemed that they<br> Looked on him strangely; on the self-same day<br> K&aacute;lf's father, Asgeir, came, and brought with him<br> Refna, his daughter, fair of face and limb,<br> Dark-haired, great-eyed, and gentle: timidly<br> She gazed at Kiartan as he drew anigh<br> And gave her welcome.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as he began<br> To ask them news of this and that good man,<br> And how he fared, Thurid with anxious face<br> Came up to him, and drew him from the place,<br> Saying, "Come, talk with me apart awhile!"<br> He followed after with a puzzled smile,<br> Yet his heart felt as something ill drew near.<br> So, when they came where none their speech might hear,<br> Thurid turned round about on him, and said,<br> "Brother, amidst thy speech, I shook with dread<br> Lest .Gudrun's name from out thy lips should burst;<br> How was it then thou spak&#146;st not of her first?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Kiartan, trembling, said, "Indeed, I thought<br> That news of ill unasked would soon be brought&#151;<br> Sister, what ails thee then&#151;is my love dead?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay," Thurid stammered, "she is well&#151;and wed." <A NAME="page_427"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 427</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What!" cried out Kiartan, "and the Peacock's house?<br> I used to deem my brothers valorous,<br> My father a great man&#151;and Bodli's sword,<br> Where was it midst this shame?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce was the word<br> Out of his lips, ere, looking on her face,<br> He turned and staggered wildly from the place,<br> Crying aloud, "O blind, O blind, O blind!<br> Where is the world I used to deem so kind,<br> So loving to me? O Gudrun, Gudrun,<br> Here I come back with all the honour won<br> We talked of, that thou saidst thou knewest well<br> Was but for thee&#151;to whom then shall I tell<br> The tale of that well-doing? And thou, friend,<br> How might I deem that aught but death should end<br> Our love together? yea, and even now,<br> How shall I learn to hate thee, friend, though thou<br> Art changed into a shadow and a lie?<br> O ill day of my birth, ill earth and sky,<br> Why was I then bemocked with days of bliss<br> If still the ending of them must be this?<br> O wretch, that once wast happy, days a-gone,<br> Before thou wert so wretched and alone,<br> How on unhappy faces wouldst thou look<br> And scarce with scorn and ruth their sorrow brook!<br> Now then at last thou knowest of the earth,<br> And why the elders look askance on mirth." <A NAME="page_428"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 428</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some paces had he gone from where she stood,<br> Gazing in terror on his hapless mood,<br> And now she called his name; he turned about,<br> And far away he heard the shipmen's shout<br> And beat of the sea, and from the down there came<br> The bleat of ewes; and all these, and his name,<br> And the sights too, the green down &#146;neath the sun,<br> The white strand and the far-off hill-sides dun,<br> And white birds wheeling, well-known things did seem,<br> But pictures now or figures in a dream,<br> With all their meaning lost. Yet therewithal<br> On his vexed spirit did the new thought fall<br> How weak and helpless and alone he was.<br> Then gently to his sister did he pass,<br> And spake:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now is the world clean changed for me<br> In this last minute, yet indeed I see<br> That still will it go on for all my pain;<br> Come then, my sister, let us back again;<br> I must meet folk, and face the life beyond,<br> And, as I may, walk &#146;neath the dreadful bond<br> Of ugly pain&#151;such men our fathers were,<br> Not lightly bowed by any weight of care."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled upon him kindly, and they went<br> And found folk gathered in the biggest tent,<br> And busied o&#146;er the wares, and gay enow<br> In outward seeming; though ye well may know<br> Folk dreaded much for all the country's sake <A NAME="page_429"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 429</FONT></A><br> In what wise Kiartan this ill news would take.<br> Now K&aacute;lf had brought the gayest things to show<br> The women-folk, and by a bale knelt now<br> That Kiartan knew right well, and close by him<br> Sat Refna, with her dainty hand and slim<br> Laid on a broidered bag, her fair head crowned<br> With that rich coif thereafter so renowned<br> In Northland story. As he entered there<br> She raised to him her deep grey eyes, and fair<br> Half-opened mouth, and blushed blood-red therewith;<br> And inwardly indeed did Kiartan writhe<br> With bitter anguish as his eyes did meet<br> Her bright-flushed gentle face so pure and sweet;<br> And he thenceforth to have no lot or part<br> In such fair things; yet struggling with his heart<br> He smiled upon her kindly. Pale she grew<br> When the flush passed, as though in sooth she knew<br> What sickness ailed him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be not wroth," she said,<br> "That I have got this queen's gift on my head,<br> I bade them do it not."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then wearily<br> He answered: "Surely it beseemeth thee<br> Right well, and they who set it there did right.<br> Rich were the man who owned the maiden bright,<br> And the bright coif together!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he spake<br> Wandered his eyes; so sore his heart did ache<br> That not for long those matters might he note; <A NAME="page_430"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 430</FONT></A><br> Yet a glad flush again dyed face and throat<br> Of Refna, and she said, "So great and famed,<br> So fair and kind! where shall the maid be named<br> To say no to thine asking?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again<br> All pale she grew, for stung by sudden pain<br> Kiartan turned round upon the shrinking maid,<br> And, laughing wildly, with a scowl he said:<br> "All women are alike to me&#151;all good&#151;<br> All blessings on this fair earth by the rood!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then silence fell on all, yet he began<br> Within awhile to talk to maid and man<br> Mildly as he was wont, and through the days<br> That they abode together in that place<br> Seemed little changed; and so his father thought<br> When he to him at last his greeting brought,<br> And bade him home to Herdholt. So they rode,<br> Talking of many things, to his abode,<br> Nor naming Gudrun aught. Thus Kiartan came<br> Back to his father's house, grown great of fame,<br> And tidingless a while day passed by day<br> What hearts soe&#146;er &#146;neath sorrow's millstone lay.</p>
