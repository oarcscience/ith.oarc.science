<p>THUS have I striven to show the troublous life<br> Of these dead folk, e&#146;en as if mid their strife<br> I dwelt myself; but now is Kiartan slain;<br> Bodli's blank yearning, Gudrun's wearying pain, <A NAME="page_520"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 520</FONT></A><br> Shall change but little now unto the end;<br> And midst a many thoughts home must I wend,<br> And in the ancient days abide no more.<br> Yet, when the shipman draweth nigh the shore,<br> And slacks the sheet and lets adown the sail,<br> Scarce suddenly therewith all way doth fail<br> The sea-clasped keel. So with this history<br> It fareth now; have patience then with me<br> A moment yet, ere all the tale is told.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Olaf Peacock lived, his sons did hold<br> Their hands from Bodli; Oswif's sons must pay<br> With gold and outlawry for that ill day,<br> And nothing else there happened to them worse<br> Than o&#146;er the sea to bear all people's curse,<br> Nor know men aught more of their history.<br> Three winters afterward did Olaf die,<br> Full both of years and honour; then was not<br> Thorgerd's fierce oath amidst her sons forgot;<br> The golden ring, whose end old Guest foresaw,<br> Worn through the weary years with many a flaw,<br> Now smitten, fell asunder: Bodli died<br> Manlike amidst his foes, with none beside<br> To sorrow o&#146;er him, scarcely loth maybe<br> The end of his warped life at last to see.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn back a while; of her I have to tell,<br> Whose sorrow on my heart the more doth dwell,<br> That nought she did to earn it, as I deem&#151; <A NAME="page_521"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 521</FONT></A><br> &#151;Unto the Ridge, where on the willowy stream<br> Her father's stead looks down, did Refna go,<br> That, if it might be, she some rest might know<br> Within the fair vale where she wandered, when<br> The bearded faces of the weaponed men<br> Were wonders to her child's eyes, far away<br> The wild thoughts of their hearts; her little day<br> Of hope and joy gone by, there yet awhile<br> She wandered once again; nor her faint smile<br> Would she withhold, when pitying eyes did gaze<br> On the deep sorrow of her lovely face;<br> For she belike felt strong, and still might deem<br> That life, all turned into a longing dream,<br> Would long abide with her&#151;happier she was,<br> But little time over her head did pass,<br> Before all smiles from off her face did fade,<br> And in the grave her yearning heart was laid,<br> No more now to be rent &#146;twixt hope and fear,<br> No more to sicken with the dull despair.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet is she left to tell of, some might call,<br> The very cause the very curse of all;<br> And yet not I&#151;for after Bodli's death<br> Too dreadful grew the dale, my story saith,<br> For Gudrun longer at her house to dwell,<br> Wherefore with Snorri, lord of Holyfell,<br> Did she change steads. There dwelt she a long space,<br> And true it is, that in her noble face<br> Men deemed but little signs of woe they saw; <A NAME="page_522"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 522</FONT></A><br> And still she lived on long, and in great awe<br> And honour was she held, nor unfulfilled<br> Was the last thing that Guest deemed fate had willed<br> Should fall on her: when Bodli's sons were men<br> And many things had happed, she wed again,<br> And though her days of keen joys might be bare<br> Yet little did they bring of added care<br> As on and on they wore from that old time<br> When she was set amidst mad love and crime.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet went this husband's end no otherwise<br> Than Guest foresaw: at last with dreamy eyes<br> And weary heart from his grave too she turned.<br> Across the waste of life on one hand burned<br> The unforgotten sore regretted days<br> Long left behind; and o&#146;er the stony ways<br> Her feet must pass yet, the grey cloud of death<br> Rolled doubtful, drawing nigher. The tale saith<br> That she lived long years afterwards, and strove,<br> E&#146;en as she might, to win a little love<br> From God now, and with bitter yearning prayer<br> Through these slow-footed lonely days to wear.<br> And men say, as to all the ways of earth<br> Her soul grew blind, and other hopes had birth<br> Within her, that her bodily sight failed too,<br> And now no more the dark from day she knew.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This one more picture gives the ancient book<br> On which I pray you for a while to look, <A NAME="page_523"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 523</FONT></A><br> If for your tears ye may. For it doth tell<br> That on a day she sat at Holyfell<br> Within the bower, another Bodli there<br> Beside her, son of him who wrought her care;<br> A travelled man and mighty, gay of weed,<br> Doer belike of many a desperate deed<br> Within the huge wall of the Grecian king.<br> A summer eve it was, and everything<br> Was calm and fair, the tinkling bells did sound<br> From the fair chapel on the higher ground<br> Of the holy hill, the murmur of the sea<br> Came on the fitful south-west soothingly;<br> The house-caries sang as homeward now they went<br> From out the home-field, and the hay's sweet scent<br> Floated around: and when the sun had died<br> An hour agone now, Bodli stirred and sighed;<br> Perchance too clearly felt he life slip by<br> Amid those pensive things, and certainly<br> He too was passed his youth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mother," he said,<br> "Awhile agone it came into my head<br> To ask thee somewhat; thou hast loved me well,<br> And this perchance is no great thing to tell<br> To one who loves thee."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her sightless eyes<br> Turned on him did she smile in loving wise,<br> But answered nought; then he went on, and said:<br> "Which of the men thou knewest&#151;who are dead<br> Long ago, mother,&#151;didst thou love the best?" <A NAME="page_524"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 524</FONT></A><br> Then her thin hands each upon each she pressed,<br> And her face quivered, as some memory<br> Were hard upon her:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, son! years go by.<br> When we are young this year we call the worst<br> That we can know; this bitter day is cursed,<br> And no more such our hearts can bear we say.<br> But yet as time from us falls fast away<br> There comes a day, son, when all this is fair<br> And sweet, to what, still living, we must bear&#151;<br> <i>Bettered is bale by bale that follows it</i>,<br> The saw saith."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent both awhile did sit<br> Until she spake again: "Easy to tell<br> About them, son, my memory serves me well:<br> A great chief Thorkel was, bounteous and wise, -<br> And ill hap seemed his death in all men's eyes.<br> Bodli thy sire was mighty of his hands,<br> Scarce better dwelt in all the northern lands;<br> Thou wouldst have loved him well. My husband Thord<br> Was a great man; wise at the council-board,<br> Well learned in law&#151;for Thorwald, he indeed,<br> A rash weak heart, like to a stinging weed<br> Must be pulled up&#151;ah, that was long ago!"<br> Then Bodli smiled, "Thou wouldst not have me know<br> Thy thought, O mother&#151;these things know I well;<br> Old folk about these men e&#146;en such tales tell."</p>  
<p>She said, "Alas, O son, thou askst of love! <A NAME="page_525"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 525</FONT></A><br> Long folly lasteth; still that word doth move<br> My old worn heart&#151;hearken one little word,<br> Then ask no more; ill is it to be stirred<br> To vain repining for the vanished days."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned, until her sightless eyes did gaze<br> As though the wall, the hills, must melt away,<br> And show her Herdholt in the twilight grey;<br> She cried, with tremulous voice; and eyes grown wet<br> For the last time, whate&#146;er should happen yet,<br> With hands stretched out for all that she had lost:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I did the worst to him I loved the most."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_526"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 526</FONT></A></p>  
<p>THEY too, those old men, well might sit and gaze<br> Upon the images of bygone days,<br> And wonder mid their soft self-pity, why<br> Mid such wild struggles had their lives gone by,<br> Since neither love nor joy, nor even pain,<br> Should last for ever; yet their strife so vain<br> While still they strove, so sore regretted now,<br> The heavy grief that once their heads did bow,<br> Had wrought so much for them, that they might sit<br> Amid some pleasure at the thought of it;<br> At least not quite consumed by sordid fear,<br> That now at last the end was come anear;<br> At least not hardened quite so much, but they<br> Might hear of love and longing worn away<br> &#146;Twixt birth and death of others, wondering<br> Belike, amid their pity what strange thing<br> Made the mere truth of what poor souls did bear<br> &#151;In vain or not in vain&#151;so sweet to hear,<br> So healing to the tangled woes of earth,<br> At least for a short while.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But little mirth<br> The grey eve and the strong unfailing wind<br> Might ask of them that tide; and yet behind<br> That mask of pensive eyes, so unbeguiled<br> By ancient folly any more, what wild<br> Strange flickering hopes ineffable might lie,<br> As swift that latter end of eve slipped by!</p>
