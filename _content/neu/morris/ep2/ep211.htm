<p align="center"><i>The Prophecy of Guest the Wise</i>.</p>  
<p>UPON a day, amid the maids that spun<br> Within the bower at Bathstead, sat Gudrun,<br> Her father in the firth a-fishing was,<br> The while her mother through the meads did pass<br> About some homely work. So there she sat,<br> Nor set her hand to this work or to that,<br> And a half-frown was on her pensive face,<br> Nor did she heed the chatter of the place<br> As girl spake unto girl. Then did she hear<br> The sound of horse-hoofs swiftly drawing near,<br> And started up, and cried, "That shall be Guest,<br> Riding, as still his wont is, from the west <A NAME="page_340"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 340</FONT></A><br> Unto the Thing, and this is just the day<br> When he is wont at Bathstead to make stay."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to the door she went, and with slim hand<br> Put it aback, and &#146;twixt the posts did stand,<br> And saw therewith a goodly company<br> Ride up the grey slopes leading from the sea.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That spring was she just come to her full height;<br> Low-bosomed yet she was, and slim and light,<br> Yet scarce might she grow fairer from that day;<br> Gold were the locks wherewith the wind did play,<br> Finer than silk, waved softly like the sea<br> After a three days&#146; calm, and to her knee<br> Well-nigh they reached; fair were the white hands laid<br> Upon the door-posts where the dragons played;<br> Her brow was smooth now, and a smile began<br> To cross her delicate mouth, the snare of man;<br> For some thought rose within the heart of her<br> That made her eyes bright, her cheeks ruddier<br> Than was their wont, yet were they delicate<br> As are the changing steps of high heaven's gate;<br> Bluer than grey her eyes were; somewhat thin<br> Her marvellous red lips; round was her chin,<br> Cloven, and clear-wrought; like an ivory tower<br> Rose up her neck from love's white-veiled bower.<br> But in such lordly raiment was she clad,<br> As midst its threads the scent of southlands had,<br> And on its hem the work of such-like hands <A NAME="page_341"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 341</FONT></A><br> As deal with silk and gold in sunny lands.<br> Too dainty seemed her feet to come anear<br> The guest-worn threshold-stone. So stood she there,<br> And rough the world about her seemed to be,<br> A rude heap cast up from the weary sea.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the new-come folk, some twelve in all,<br> Drew rein before the doorway of the hall,<br> And she a step or two across the grass<br> Unto the leader of the men did pass,<br> A white-haired elder clad in kirtle red:<br> "Be welcome here, O Guest the Wise!" she said,<br> "My father honours me so much that I<br> Am bid to pray thee not to pass us by,<br> But bide here for a while; he says withal<br> That thou and he together in the hall<br> Are two wise men together, two who can<br> Talk cunningly about the ways of man."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guest laughed, and leapt from off his horse, and said:<br> "Fair words from fair lips, and a goodly stead,<br> But unto Thickwood must I go to-night<br> To give my kinsman Armod some delight;<br> Nevertheless here will we rest a while,<br> And thou and I with talk an hour beguile,<br> For so it is that all men say of thee,<br> 'Not far off falls the apple from the tree,'<br> That &#146;neath thy coif some day shall lie again <A NAME="page_342"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 342</FONT></A><br> When he is dead, 'the wise old Oswif's brain."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that he took her hand, and to the hall<br> She led him, and his fellows one and all<br> Leapt to the ground, and followed clattering<br> In through the porch, and many a goodly thing<br> There had they plenteously; but mid the noise<br> And rattling horns and laughter, with clear voice<br> Spake Gudrun unto Guest, and ever he<br> Smiled at her goodly sayings joyfully,<br> And yet at whiles grew grave; yea, and she too,<br> Though her eyes glistened, seemed as scarce she knew<br> The things she said. At last, amid their speech,<br> The old man stayed his hand as it did reach<br> Out to the beaker, and his grey eyes stared<br> As though unseen things to his soul were bared;<br> Then Gudrun waited trembling, till he said:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Liest thou awake at midnight in thy bed,<br> Thinking of dreams dreamed in the winter-tide,<br> When the north-east, turned off the mountain-side,<br> Shook the stout timbers of the hall, as when<br> They shook in Norway ere the upland men<br> Bore axe against them?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She spake low to him:<br> "So is it, but of these the most wax dim<br> When daylight comes again; but four there are&#151;<br> Four dreams in one&#151;that bring me yet great care,<br> Nor may I soon forget them, yea, they sink<br> Still deeper in my soul&#151;but do thou drink, <A NAME="page_343"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 343</FONT></A><br> And tell me merry tales; of what avail<br> To speak of things that make a maiden pale<br> And a man laugh?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak quick," he said, "before<br> This glimmer of a sight I have is o&#146;er."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she delayed not, but in quick words said:<br> "Methought that with a coif upon my head<br> I stood upon a stream-side, and withal<br> Upon my heart the sudden thought did fall<br> How foul that coif was, and how ill it sat,<br> And though the folk beside me spoke &#146;gainst that,<br> Nevertheless, from off mine head I tore<br> The cursed thing, and cast it from the shore;<br> And glad at heart was I when it was gone,<br> And woke up laughing."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, the second one,"<br> Said Guest; "Make good speed now, and tell me all!"</p>  
<p>"This was the dream," she said, "that next did fall:<br> By a great water was I; on mine arm<br> A silver ring, that more my heart did charm<br> Than one might deem that such a small thing might;<br> My very own indeed seemed that delight,<br> And long I looked to have it; but as I<br> Stood and caressed the dear thing, suddenly<br> It slipped from off my arm, and straightway fell<br> Into the water: nor is more to tell <A NAME="page_344"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 344</FONT></A><br> But that I wept thereat, and sorrowed sore<br> As for a friend that I should see no more."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As great," said Guest, "is this thing as the last,<br> What follows after?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O&#146;er the road I passed<br> Nigh Bathstead," said she, "in fair raiment clad,<br> And on mine arm a golden ring I had;<br> And seemly did I deem it, yet the love<br> I had therefor was not so much above<br> That wherewithal I loved the silver ring,<br> As gold is held by all a dearer thing<br> Than silver is; now, whatso worth it bore,<br> Methought that needs for longer than before<br> This ring should give me what it might of bliss;<br> But even as with foolish dreams it is<br> So was it now; falling I seemed to be,<br> And spread my arms abroad to steady me;<br> Upon a stone the ring smote, and atwain<br> It broke; and when I stooped the halves to gain,<br> Lo, blood ran out from either broken place;<br> Then as I gazed thereon I seemed to trace<br> A flaw within the craftsman's work, whereby<br> The fair thing brake; yea, withal presently<br> Yet other flaws therein could I discern;<br> And as I stood and looked, and sore did yearn,<br> Midst blind regrets, rather than raging pain,<br> For that fair thing I should not see again,<br> My eyes seemed opened, to my heart it came, <A NAME="page_345"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 345</FONT></A><br> Spite of those flaws, that on me lay the blame<br> Why thus was spoiled that noble gift and rare,<br> Because therewith I dealt not with due care:<br> So with a sigh I woke."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ill fare," said Guest,<br> "Three of thy dreams, tell now about the rest."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the last of the four dreams," she said;<br> "Methought I had a helm upon my head,<br> Wrought all of gold, with precious gems beset,<br> And pride and joy I had therein, and yet,<br> So heavy was it, that I scarce might hold<br> My head upright for that great weight of gold;<br> Yet for all that I laid no blame or wrong<br> Upon it, and I fain had kept it long;<br> But amid this, while least I looked therefor,<br> Something, I knew not what, the fair helm tore<br> From off mine head, and then I saw it swept<br> Into the firth, and when I would have wept<br> Then my voice failed me, and mine eyes were dry<br> Despite my heart; and therewith presently<br> I woke, and heard withal the neat-herd's song<br> As o&#146;er the hard white snow he went along<br> Unto the byre, shouldering his load of hay;<br> Then knew I the beginning of the day,<br> And to the window went and saw afar<br> The wide firth, black beneath the morning-star,<br> And all the waste of snow, and saw the man<br> Dark on the slope; &#146;twixt the dead earth and wan,<A NAME="page_346"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 346</FONT></A><br> And the dark vault of star-besprinkled sky,<br> Croaking, a raven toward the sea did fly&#151;<br> &#151;With that I fell a yearning for the spring,<br> And all the pleasant things that it should bring,<br> And lay back in my bed and shut my eyes,<br> To see what pictures to my heart would rise,<br> And slept, but dreamed no more; now spring is here&#151;<br> Thou knowst perchance, made wise with many a year,<br> What thing it is I long for; but to me<br> All grows as misty as the autumn sea<br> &#146;Neath the first hoar-frost, and I name it not,<br> The thing wherewith my wondering heart is hot"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Guest turned round upon her, with a smile<br> Beholding her fair face a little while,<br> And as he looked on her she hid her eyes<br> With slim hands, but he saw the bright flush rise,<br> Despite of them, up to her forehead fair;<br> Therewith he sighed as one who needs must bear<br> A heavy burden.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since thou thus hast told<br> Thy dreams," he said, "scarce may I now withhold<br> The tale of what mine eyes have seen therein;<br> Yet little from my foresight shalt thou win,<br> Since both the blind, and they who see full well,<br> Go the same road, and leave a tale to tell<br> Of interwoven miseries, lest they,<br> Who after them a while on earth must stay,<br> Should have no pleasure in the winter night, <A NAME="page_347"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 347</FONT></A><br> When this man's pain is made that man's delight."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled an old man's smile, as thus he spake,<br> Then said, "But I must hasten ere it break<br> The thin sharp thread of light that yet I see&#151;<br> &#151;Methinks a stirring life shall hap to thee.<br> Thou shalt be loved and love; wrongs shalt thou give,<br> Wrongs shalt thou take, and therewithal outlive<br> Both wrongs, and love, and joy, and dwell alone<br> When all the fellows of thy life are gone.<br> Nay, think not I can tell thee much of this,<br> How it shall hap, the sorrow or the bliss<br> Only foreshadowing of outward things,<br> Great, and yet not the greatest, dream-lore brings.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For whereas of the ill coif thou didst dream,<br> That such a husband unto me doth seem<br> As thou shalt think mates thee but ill enow,<br> Nor shall love-longings bind thee; so shalt thou<br> By thine own deed shake off this man from thee.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But next the ring of silver seems to me,<br> Another husband, loved and loving well;<br> But even as the ring from off thee fell<br> Into the water, so it is with him,<br> The sea shall make his love and promise dim.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;But for the gold ring; thou shalt wed again, <A NAME="page_348"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 348</FONT></A><br> A worthier man belike&#151;yet well-nigh vain<br> My strivings are to see what means the gold<br> Thou lovedst not more than silver: I am old<br> And thou art very young; hadst thou my sight,<br> Perchance herein thou wouldst have more of might.<br> But my heart says, that on the land there comes<br> A faith that telleth of more lovesome homes<br> For dead men, than we deemed of heretofore,<br> And that this man full well shall know that lore.<br> But whereas blood from out the ring did run,<br> By the sword's edge his life shall be foredone:<br> Then for the flaws&#151;see thou thyself to these!<br> Thou knowest how a thing full well may please,<br> When first thou hast it in thine hold, until<br> Up to the surface float the seeds of ill,<br> And vain regret o&#146;er all thy life is spread.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;But for the heavy helm that bowed thine head&#151;<br> This, thy last husband, a great chief shall be<br> And hold a helm of terror over thee<br> Though thou shalt love him: at the end of life<br> His few last minutes shall he spend in strife<br> With the wild waves of Hwammfirth, and in vain,<br> For him too shall the white sea-goddess gain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So is thy dream areded; but these things<br> Shall hang above thee, as on unheard wings<br> The kestrel hangs above the mouse; nor more<br> As erst I said shalt thou gain by my lore <A NAME="page_349"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 349</FONT></A><br> Than at the end of life, perchance, a smile<br> That fate with sight and blindness did beguile<br> Thine eyes in such sort&#151;that thou knewst the end,<br> But not the way whereon thy feet did wend<br> On any day amid the many years,<br> Wherethrough thou waitedst for the flood of tears,<br> The dreariness that at some halting-place,<br> Waited in turn to change thy smiling face.<br> Be merry yet! these things shall not be all<br> That unto thee in this thy life shall fall."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid these latter words of his, the may<br> From her fair face had drawn her hands away,<br> And sat there with fixed eyes, and face grown pale,.<br> As one who sees the corner of the veil,<br> That hideth strange things, lifted for a while;<br> But when he ceased, she said with a faint smile<br> And trembling lips:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thanked be thou; well it is!<br> From thee I get no promise of vain bliss,<br> And constant joy; a tale I might have had<br> From flattering lips to make my young heart glad&#151;<br> Yea, have my thanks!&#151;yet wise as thou mayst be,<br> Mayst thou not dimly through these tangles see?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered nought, but sat awhile with eyes<br> Distraught and sad, and face made over wise<br> With many a hard vain struggle; but at last<br> As one who from him a great weight doth cast,<br> He rose and snake to her: <A NAME="page_350"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 350</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wild words, fair may,<br> Now time it is that we were on our way."<br> Then unto him her visage did she turn,<br> In either cheek a bright red spot did burn,<br> Her teeth were set hard, and her brow was knit<br> As though she saw her life and strove with it.<br> Yet presently but common words she spake,<br> And bid him bide yet for her father's sake,<br> To make him joyful when the boards were laid;<br> But certainly, whatever words she said,<br> She heeded little, only from her tongue<br> By use and wont clear in his ears they rung.<br> Guest answered as before, that he would ride,<br> Because that night at Thickwood must he bide;<br> So silent now with wandering weary eyes<br> She watched his men do on their riding guise,<br> Then led him from the hall but listlessly,<br> As though she heeded nought where she might be.<br> So forth he rode, but turned and backward gazed<br> Before his folk the garth-gate latch had raised,<br> And saw her standing yet anigh the hall,<br> With her long shadow cast upon its wall,<br> As with her eyes turned down upon the ground<br> A long lock of her hair she wound and wound<br> About her hand. Then turning once again,<br> He passed the gate and shook his bridle-rein.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now but a short way had he gone ere he<br> Beheld a man draw nigh their company, <A NAME="page_351"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 351</FONT></A><br> Who, when they met, with fair words Guest did greet,<br> And said that Olaf Peacock bade him meet<br> Him and his men, and bid them to his stead:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And well ye wot, O Goodman Guest," he said,<br> "That all day long it snoweth meat and drink<br> At Herdholt, and the gurgle and the clink<br> Of mead and horns, the harp alone doth still."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guest laughed, and said, "Well, be that as it will,<br> Get swiftly back, and say that I will come<br> To look upon the marvels of his home<br> And hear his goodly voice; but may not bide<br> The night through, for to Thickwood must I ride."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the man turned and smote his horse; but they<br> Rode slowly by the borders of the bay<br> Upon that fresh and sunny afternoon,<br> Noting the sea-birds&#146; cry and surf's soft tune,<br> Until at last into the dale they came,<br> And saw the gilt roof-ridge of Herdholt flame<br> In the bright sunlight over the fresh grass,<br> O&#146;er which the restless white-woolled lambs did pass<br> And querulous grey ewes; and wide around,<br> Near and far up the dale, they heard the sound<br> Of lowing kine, and the blithe neat-herd's voice,<br> For in those days did all things there rejoice.<br> Now presently from out the garth they saw<br> A goodly company unto them draw,<br> And thitherward came Olaf and his men;<br> So joyous greeting was betwixt them when <A NAME="page_352"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 352</FONT></A><br> They met, and side by side the two chiefs rode,<br> Right glad at heart unto the fair abode.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great-limbed was Olaf Hauskuldson, well knit,<br> And like a chief upon his horse did sit;<br> Clear-browed and wide-eyed was he, smooth of skin<br> Through fifty rough years; of his mother's kin,<br> The Erse king's daughter, did his short lip tell,<br> And dark-lashed grey-blue eyes; like a clear bell<br> His voice was yet, despite of waves and wind,<br> And such a goodly man you scarce might find,<br> As for his years, in all the northern land.<br> He held a gold-wrought spear in his right hand,<br> A chief's gold ring his left arm did upbear,<br> And as a mighty king's was all his gear,<br> Well shaped of Flanders' cloth, and silk and gold.<br> Thus they their way up to the garth did hold,<br> And Thord the Short, Guest's son, was next thereby,<br> A brisk man and a brave; so presently<br> They passed the garth-wall, and drew rein before<br> The new-built hall's well-carven, fair porch-door,<br> And Guest laughed out with pleasure, to behold<br> Its goodly fashion, as the Peacock told<br> With what huge heed and care the place was wrought,<br> And of the Norway earl's great wood, he brought<br> Over the sea; then in they went and Guest<br> Gazed through the cool dusk, till his eyes did rest<br> Upon the noble stories, painted fair<br> On the high panelling and roof-boards there; <A NAME="page_353"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 353</FONT></A><br> For over the high-seat, in his ship there lay<br> The gold-haired Baldur, god of the dead day,<br> The spring-flowers round his high pile, waiting there<br> Until the Gods thereto the torch should bear;<br> And they were wrought on this side and on that,<br> Drawing on towards him. There was Frey, and sat<br> On the gold-bristled boar, who first they say<br> Ploughed the brown earth, and made it green for Frey.<br> Then came dark-bearded Ni&ouml;rd; and after him<br> Freyia, thin-robed, about her ankles slim<br> The grey cats playing. In another place<br> Thor's hammer gleamed o&#146;er Thor's red-bearded face;<br> And Heimdall, with the gold horn slung behind,<br> That in the God's-dusk he shall surely wind,<br> Sickening all hearts with fear; and last of all<br> Was Odin's sorrow wrought upon the wall,<br> As slow-paced, weary-faced, he went along,<br> Anxious with all the tales of woe and wrong<br> His ravens, Thought and Memory, bring to him.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guest looked on these until his eyes grew dim,<br> Then turned about, and had no word to praise,<br> So wrought in him the thought of those strange days<br> Done with so long ago. But furthermore<br> Upon the other side, the deeds of Thor<br> Were duly done; the fight in the far sea<br> With him who rings the world's iniquity,<br> The Midgard Worm; strife in the giants' land,<br> With snares and mockeries thick on either hand, <A NAME="page_354"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 354</FONT></A><br> And dealings with the Evil One who brought<br> Death even amid the Gods&#151;all these well wrought<br> Did Guest behold, as in a dream, while still<br> His joyous men the echoing hall did fill<br> With many-voiced strange clamour, as of these<br> They talked, and stared on all the braveries.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to the presses in the cloth-room there<br> Did Olaf take him, and showed hangings fair<br> Brought from the southlands far across the sea,<br> And English linen and fair napery,<br> And Flemish cloth; then back into the hall<br> He led him, and took arms from off the wall,<br> And let the mail-coat rings run o&#146;er his hands,<br> And strung strange bows brought from the fiery lands.<br> Then through the butteries he made him pass,<br> And, smiling, showed what winter stock yet was;<br> Fish, meal, and casks of wine, and goodly store<br> Of honey, that the bees had grumbled o&#146;er<br> In clover fields of Kent. Out went they then<br> And saw in what wise Olaf's serving-men<br> Dealt with the beasts, and what fair stock he had,<br> And how the maids were working blithe and glad<br> Within the women's chamber. Then at last,<br> Guest smiled, and said;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right fair is all thou hast,<br> A noble life thou livest certainly,<br> And in such wise as now, still may it be,<br> Nor mayst thou know beginning of ill days!<br> Now let it please thee that we go our ways, <A NAME="page_355"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 355</FONT></A><br> E&#146;en as I said, for the sun falleth low."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So be it then," said he. "Nor shalt thou go<br> Giftless henceforth; and I will go with thee<br> Some little way, for we my sons may see;<br> And fain I am to know how to thine eyes<br> They seem, because I know thee for most wise,<br> And that the cloud of time from thee hides less<br> Than from most men, of woe or happiness."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that he gave command, and men brought forth<br> Two precious things; a hat of goodly worth,<br> Of fur of Russia, with a gold chain wound<br> Thrice round it, and a coin of gold that bound<br> The chain's end in the front, and on the same<br> A Greek king's head was wrought, of mighty fame<br> In olden time; this unto Guest he gave,<br> And smiled to see his deep-set eyes and grave<br> Gleam out with joy thereover: but to Thord,<br> Guest's son, he gave a well-adorned sword<br> And English-&#146;broidered belt; and then once more<br> They mounted by the goodly carven door,<br> And to their horses gat all Guest's good men,<br> And forth they rode toward Laxriver: but when<br> They had just overtopped a low knoll's brow,<br> Olaf cried out, "There play hot hearts enow<br> In the cold waves!" Then Guest looked, and afar<br> Beheld the tide play on the sandy bar<br> About the stream's mouth, as the sea waves rushed <A NAME="page_356"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 356</FONT></A><br> In over it and back the land-stream pushed;<br> But in the dark wide pool mid foam-flecks white,<br> Beneath the slanting afternoon sunlight,<br> He saw white bodies sporting, and the air<br> Light from the south-west up the slopes did bear<br> Sound of their joyous cries as there they played.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said he, "Goodman, thou art well apaid<br> Of thy fair sons, if they shall deal as well<br> With earth as water."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nought there is tell<br> Of great deeds at their hands as yet," said he;<br> "But look you, how they note our company!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For waist-high from the waves one rose withal,<br> And sent a shrill voice like a sea-mew's call<br> Across the river, then all turned toward land,<br> And beat the waves to foam with foot and hand,<br> And certes kept no silence; up the side<br> They scrambled, and about the shore spread wide<br> Seeking their raiment, and the yellowing sun<br> Upon the line of moving bodies shone,<br> As running here and there with laugh and shout<br> They flung the linen and grey cloth about,<br> Yet spite of all their clamour clad them fast.<br> So Guest and Olaf o&#146;er the green slopes passed<br> At sober pace, the while the other men<br> Raced down to meet the swimmers. <A NAME="page_357"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 357</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many then<br> There are, who have no part or lot in thee<br> Among these lads," said Guest.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea, such there be,"<br> Said Olaf, "sons of dale-dwellers hereby;<br> But Kiartan rules the swimming."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earnestly<br> Guest gazed upon the lads as they drew near,<br> And scarcely now he seemed the words to hear<br> That Olaf spake, who talked about his race<br> And how they first had dwelling in that place;<br> But at the last Guest turned his horse about<br> Up stream, and drew rein, yet, as one in doubt,<br> Looked o&#146;er his shoulder at the youths withal;<br> But nought said Olaf, doubting what should fall<br> From those wise lips.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Guest spake, "Who are these?<br> Tell me their names; yon lad upon his knees,<br> Turning the blue cloak over with his hands,<br> While over him a sturdy fellow stands,<br> Talking belike?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hauskuld, my youngest son,"<br> Said Olaf, "kneels there, but the standing one<br> Is An the Black, my house-carle, a stout man."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good," Guest said; "name the one who e&#146;en now ran<br> Through upraised hands a glittering silver chain, <A NAME="page_358"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 358</FONT></A><br> And, as we look now, gives it back again<br> Unto a red-haired youth, tall, fair, and slim."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Haldor it was who gave the chain to him,<br> And Helgi took it," Olaf said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Guest:<br> "There kneeleth one in front of all the rest,<br> Less clad than any there, and hides from me<br> Twain who are sitting nigher to the sea?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Then Olaf looked with shaded eyes and said:<br> "Steinthor, the sluggard, is it, by my head<br> He hideth better men! nay, look now, look!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then toward the stream his spear-butt Olaf shook,<br> As Steinthor rose, and gat somewhat aside,<br> And showed the other twain he first did hide.<br> On a grey stone anigh unto the stream<br> Sat a tall youth whose golden head did gleam<br> In the low sun; half covered was his breast,<br> His right arm bare as yet, a sword did rest<br> Upon his knees, and some half-foot of it<br> He from the sheath had drawn; a man did sit<br> Upon the grass before him; slim was he,<br> Black-haired and tall, and looked up smilingly<br> Into the other's face, with one hand laid<br> Upon the sword-sheath nigh the broad grey blade,<br> And seemed as though he listened. <A NAME="page_359"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 359</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then spake Guest:<br> "No need, O friend, to ask about the rest,<br> Since I have seen these; for without a word<br> Kiartan I name the man who draws the sword<br> From out the sheath, and low down in the shade<br> Before him Bodli Thorleikson is laid.<br> But tell me of that sword, who bore it erst?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Olaf laughed, "Some call that sword accursed;<br> Bodli now bears it, which the Eastlander<br> Geirmund, my daughter's husband, once did wear,<br> Hast thou not heard the tale? he won the maid<br> By my wife's word, wherefor with gold he paid,<br> Or so I deemed; but whereas of good kin<br> The man was, and the women hot herein,<br> I stood not in the way; well, but his love,<br> Whate&#146;er it was, quenched not his will to rove;<br> He left her, but would nowise leave the sword,<br> And so she helped herself, and for reward<br> Got that, and a curse with it, babblers say.<br> &#151;Let see if it prevail &#146;gainst my good day!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guest answered nought at all, his head was turned<br> Eastward, away from where the low sun burned<br> Above the swimmers. Olaf spake once more:<br> "Wise friend, thou thus hast heard their names told o&#146;er,<br> How thinkest thou? hast thou the heart to tell<br> Which in the years to come shall do right well?" <A NAME="page_360"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 360</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guest spake nought for a while, and then he said,<br> But yet not turning any more his head:<br> "Surely of this at least thou wouldst be glad,<br> If Kiartan while he lived more glory had<br> Than any man now waxing in the land."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then even as he spoke he raised his hand<br> And smote his horse, and rode upon his way<br> With no word more; neither durst Olaf stay<br> His swift departing, doubting of his mood;<br> For though indeed the word he spake was good,<br> Yet some vague fear he seemed to leave behind,<br> And Olaf scarce durst seek, lest he should find<br> Some ill thing lurking by his glory's side.<br> But after Guest his son and men did ride,<br> And forth to Thickwood with no stay they went.<br> But now, the journey and the day nigh spent,<br> Unto his father as they rode turned Thord,<br> With mind to say to him some common word,<br> But stared astonished, for the great tears ran<br> Over the wrinkled cheeks of the old man,<br> Yea, and adown his beard, nor shame had he<br> That Thord in such a plight his face should see,<br> At last he spake:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou wonderest, O my son,<br> To see the tears fall down from such an one<br> As I am&#151;folly is it in good sooth<br> Bewraying inward grief; but pain and ruth<br> Work in me so, I may not hold my peace <A NAME="page_361"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 361</FONT></A><br> About the woes, that as thy years increase<br> Thou shalt behold fall on the country-side&#151;<br> &#151;But me the grey cairn ere that day shall hide&#151;<br> Fair men and women have I seen to-day,<br> Yet I weep not because these pass away,<br> Sad though that is, but rather weep for this,<br> That they know not upon their day of bliss<br> How their worn hearts shall fail them ere they die,<br> How sore the weight of woe on them shall lie,<br> No sighing eases, wherewithal no hope,<br> No pride, no rage, shall make them fit to cope.<br> Remember what folk thou this day hast seen,<br> And in what joyous steads thy feet have been,<br> Then think of this!&#151;that men may look to see<br> Love slaying love, and ruinous victory,<br> And truth called lies, and kindness turned to hate,<br> And prudence sowing seeds of all debate!<br> Son, thou shalt live to hear when I am dead<br> Of Bodli standing over Kiartan's head,<br> His friend, his foster-brother, and his bane,<br> That he in turn e&#146;en such an end may gain.<br> Woe worth the while! forget it, and be blind!<br> Look not before thee! the road left behind,<br> Let that be to thee as a tale well told<br> To make thee merry when thou growest old!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So spake he; but by this time had they come<br> Unto the wood that lay round Armod's home,<br> So on the tree-beset and narrow way <A NAME="page_362"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 362</FONT></A><br> They entered now, and left behind the day;<br> And whatso things thenceforth to Guest befell,<br> No more of him the story hath to tell.</p>
