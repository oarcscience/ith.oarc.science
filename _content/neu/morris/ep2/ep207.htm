<p><A NAME="page_208"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 208</FONT></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE MAN WHO NEVER LAUGHED AGAIN.</h3>  <h4 align="center">ARGUMENT.</h4>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">A CERTAIN man, who from rich had become poor, having been taken by one of his former friends to a fair house, was shown strange things there, and dwelt there awhile among a company of doleful men; but these in the end dying, and he desiring above all things to know their story, so it happened that he at last learned it to his own cost.</FONT></p>  
<p>A CITY was there nigh the Indian Sea,<br> As tells my tale, where folk for many an age<br> Had lived, perforce, such life as needs must be<br> Beneath the rule of priestly king and mage,<br> Bearing with patient hearts the summer's rage,<br> Yea, even bowing foolish heads in vain<br> Before the mighty sun, their life and bane.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now ere the hottest of the summer came,<br> While yet the rose shed perfume on the earth,<br> And still the grass was green despite the flame<br> Of that land's sun&#151;while folk gave up to mirth<br> A little of their life, so little worth, <A NAME="page_209"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 209</FONT></A><br> And the rich man forgot his fears awhile<br> Beneath the soft eve's still recurring smile&#151;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mid those sweet days, when e&#146;en the burning land<br> Knew somewhat of the green north's summer rest,<br> A stately house within the town did stand,<br> When the fresh morn was failing from its best,<br> Though the street's pavement still the shadow blessed<br> From whispering trees, that rose, thick-leaved and tall,<br> Above the well-built marble bounding-wall.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each side the door therein rose-garlands hung,<br> And through the doorway you might see within<br> The glittering robes of minstrel-men that sung,<br> And resting dancing-girls in raiment thin,<br> Because the master there did now begin<br> Another day of ease and revelry,<br> To make it harder yet for him to die.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And toward the door, perfumed and garlanded,<br> The guests passed, clad in wonderful attire,<br> And this and that one through the archway led<br> Some girl, made languid by the rosy fire<br> Of that fair time; with love and sweet desire<br> The air seemed filled, and how could such folk see<br> In any eyes unspoken misery?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet &#146;gainst the marble wall, anigh the door,<br> A man leaned, gazing at the passers-by, <A NAME="page_210"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 210</FONT></A><br> Who, young, was clad in wretched clothes and poor,<br> And whose pale face, grown thin with misery,<br> Told truthful stories of his end anigh,<br> For such a one was he as rich men fear,<br> Friendless and poor, nor taught hard toil to bear;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some in passing by that woeful man<br> A little time indeed their loud talk stayed<br> To gaze upon his haggard face and wan,<br> Some even, their hands upon their pouches laid,<br> But all passed on again, as if afraid<br> That, e&#146;en in giving thanks for unasked gift,<br> His dolorous voice their veil of joy would lift.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked for nought, nor did his weary eyes<br> Meet theirs at all, until there came at last,<br> On a white mule, and clad in noble guise,<br> A lonely man, who by the poor wretch passed,<br> And, passing, on his face a side-glance cast,<br> Then o&#146;er his shoulder eyed him, then drew rein<br> And turned about, and came to him again;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, "Thou hast the face of one I knew,<br> Men called the Golden One, in such a town,<br> Because they deemed his wealth for ever grew,<br> E&#146;en in such times as beats the richest down;<br> What stroke of hapless fate, then, hast thou known<br> That thou hast come to such a state as this,<br> To which the poorest peasant's would be bliss?" <A NAME="page_211"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 211</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other raised his eyes, and stared awhile<br> Into the speaker's face, as one who draws<br> His soul from dreams, then with a bitter smile<br> He said, "Firuz, thou askest of the cause<br> Of this my death? I knew not the world's laws,<br> But 'give today, and take tomorrow-morn,'<br> I needs must say, holding the wise in scorn.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For even as with gifts contempt I bought,<br> So knowledge buys disease, power loneliness,<br> And honour fear, and pleasure pains unsought,<br> And friendship anxious days of great distress,<br> And love the hate of what we used to bless&#151;<br> Ah, I am wise, and wiser soon shall grow,<br> And know the most that wise dead men can know.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What shall I say? thou knowest the old tale;<br> I gave, I spent, and then I asked in vain,<br> And when I fell, my hands could scarce avail<br> For any work; at last, worse woe to gain,<br> I fled from folk who knew my present pain<br> And ancient pleasure&#151;&#146;midst strange men I wait,<br> In this strange town, the last new jest of fate.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But since we talk of such-like merchandize,<br> What gift has bought for thee an equal curse?<br> Because, indeed, I deem by this thy guise<br> Thou hast not reached the bottom of thy purse;<br> Therefore, perchance, thy face seems something worse <A NAME="page_212"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 212</FONT></A><br> Than mine, for I shall die, but thou must live,<br> More laughter yet unto the Gods to give?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor did he speak these words unwarranted,<br> For in the other's face those signs there were<br> That mark the soul wherein all hope is dead;<br> While, with the new-born image of despair<br> The first man played, and found life even there,<br> Changeless his old friend's face was grown, and he<br> Had no more eyes things new or strange to see.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "Then hast thou still a wish on earth;<br> Come now with me, if thou wouldst know my fate:<br> Thou yet mayst win again that time of mirth<br> When every day was as a flowery gate<br> Through which we passed to joy, importunate<br> To win us from the thought of yesterday,<br> In whatso pleasures it had passed away!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Great things thou promisest," the other said,<br> "And yet indeed since I have feared to die,<br> Though well I know that I were better dead,<br> The life thou givest me I yet will try;<br> It will not be so long in passing by,<br> If it must be such life as thou hast shared&#151;<br> Yet thanks to thee who thus for me hast cared."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Friend," said he, "in thine hand thy life thou hast,<br> If thou hast told me all that grieveth thee, <A NAME="page_213"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 213</FONT></A><br> And unto thee the past may well be past,<br> And days not wholly bad thou yet mayst see;<br> And if indeed thy first felicity<br> Thou winnest not, yet something shalt thou have<br> Thy soul from death, or loathed life, to save.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And for thy thanks, something I deem I owe<br> To our old friendship, could I mind it aught,<br> And well it is that I should pay it now<br> While yet I have a little wavering thought<br> Of things without me: neither have I brought<br> A poisoned life to give to thee today,<br> Or such a life as I have cast away."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay," said he, "let all be since I must live,<br> I will not think of how to play my part:<br> And now some food to me thou needs must give,<br> For wretched hunger gnaweth at my heart.<br> Take heed withal that old desires will start<br> Up to the light since first I heard thee speak,<br> Wretched as now I am, and pined and weak."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firuz thenceforward scarcely seemed to heed<br> What words he said, but as a man well taught<br> To do some dull task, set himself to lead<br> That man unto an hostel, where they brought<br> Food unto him, and raiment richly wrought;<br> Then he being mounted on a mule, the twain<br> Set out therefrom some new abode to gain. <A NAME="page_214"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 214</FONT></A></p>  
<p>NOW cheered by food, and hope at least of ease,<br> Perchance of something more, as on they went<br> Betwixt the thronged streets and the palaces,<br> No more did Bharam keep his head down bent,<br> Rather from right to left quick glances sent,<br> And though his old complaints he murmured still,<br> He scarcely thought his life so lost and ill.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for his fellow, worse he seemed to be<br> Than e&#146;en before, his thin face pinched and grey,<br> Seemed sunk yet deeper into misery,<br> Nor did he lift his eyes from off the way,<br> Nor heed what things his friend to him might say,<br> But plodded on till they were past the town,<br> When now the fiery sun was falling down.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then by the farms and fields they went, until<br> All tillage and smooth ways were left behind,<br> And half-way up a bare and rugged hill<br> They entered a rude forest close and blind,<br> And many a tale perforce seized Bharam's mind<br> Of lonely men by fiends bewildered,<br> So like his fellow looked to one long dead.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now, as careless what might hap to him,<br> He &#146;gan to sing of roses and delight <A NAME="page_215"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 215</FONT></A><br> Some snatch, until the wood that had been dim,<br> E&#146;en in broad day, grew black with coming night;<br> Then lower sank his song, and dropped outright,<br> When on his rein he felt his guide's hand fall,<br> And still they pierced that blackness like a wall.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus on the little-beaten forest-soil<br> They went, with nought to see, and nought to hear<br> Except their mules&#146; unceasing, patient toil:<br> But full the darkness seemed of forms of fear,<br> And like long histories passed the minutes drear<br> To Bharam's o&#146;erwrought mind expecting death,<br> And like a challenge seemed his lowest breath.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long they went he knew not, but at last<br> Upon his face he felt a doubtful breeze,<br> Quickening his soul, and onward as they passed<br> A feeble glimmer showed betwixt the trees,<br> And his eyes, used to darkness, by degrees<br> Could dimly see his fellow, and the way<br> Whereon they rode to some unearthly day.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then as the boughs grew thinner overhead,<br> That glimmer widened into moonlit night,<br> And &#146;twixt the trees grown sparse their pathway led<br> Unto a wide bare plain, that &#146;neath that light<br> Against the black trunks showed all stark and white;<br> Then Bharam, more at ease thereat, began<br> His fellow's visage in that light to scan. <A NAME="page_216"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 216</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No change was in his face, and if he knew<br> Who rode beside him, &#146;twas but as some hook<br> Within an engine knows what it must do,<br> His hand indeed from his friend's rein he took,<br> But never cast on him one slightest look;<br> Then, shuddering, Bharam &#146;gan to sing again<br> To make him turn, but spent his breath in vain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the trees were wholly past, afar<br> Across the plain they saw a watch-tower high,<br> That &#146;neath the moonlight, like an angry star,<br> Shone over a white palace, and thereby<br> Within white walls did black-treed gardens lie:<br> And Firuz smote his mule and hastened on<br> To where that distant sign of trouble shone.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as they went, thereon did Bharam stare,<br> Nor turned his eyes at all unto the plain,<br> Nor heeded when from out her form the hare<br> Started beneath the mule's feet, and in vain<br> The owl called from the wood, for he drew rein<br> Within a little while before the gate,<br> Casting his soul into the hands of fate.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Firuz blew the horn, nor waited long<br> Ere the gate, opened by a man scarce seen,<br> Gave entry to a garden, where the song<br> Of May's brown bird had hardly left the green<br> Sweet-blossomed tree-tops lonely, and between <A NAME="page_217"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 217</FONT></A><br> The whispering glades the fountain leaped on high,<br> And the rose waited till morn came, to die.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the first wave of that soft delight<br> Swept o&#146;er the spendthrift's sense, he smiled and turned<br> Unto his guide throughout the wondrous night,<br> And while his heart with hope and wonder burned,<br> He said, "Indeed a fair thing have I learned<br> With thee for master; yet is this the end?<br> Will they not now bring forth the bride, O friend?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drunk with the sweetness of that place he spoke,<br> And hoped to see the mask fall suddenly<br> From his friend's face, from whose thin lips there broke<br> A dreadful cry of helpless misery,<br> Scaring the birds from flowery bush and tree;<br> "O fool!" he said; "say such things in the day,<br> When noise and light take memory more away!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bharam shrank back abashed, nor had a word<br> To say thereto, and &#146;twixt the trees they rode,<br> Noted of nothing but some wakeful bird,<br> Until they reached a fair and great abode<br> Whereon the red gold e&#146;en in moonlight glowed.<br> There silently they lighted down before<br> Smooth marble stairs, and through the open door <A NAME="page_218"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 218</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They entered a great, dimly-lighted hall;<br> Yet through the dimness well our man could see<br> How fair the hangings were that clad the wall,<br> And what a wealth of beast and flower and tree<br> Was spent wherever carving there might be,<br> And what a floor was &#146;neath his wearied feet,<br> Not made for men who call death rest and sweet.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he, though fain to linger and to ask<br> What was the manner of their living there,<br> And what thenceforth should be his proper task,<br> And who his fellows were, did nowise dare<br> To meet that cry again that seemed to bare<br> A wretched life of every softening veil&#151;<br> A dreadful prelude to a dreadful tale.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So silently whereas the other led<br> He followed, and through corridors they passed,<br> Dim lit, but worthy of a king new wed,<br> Till to a chamber did they come at last,<br> O&#146;er which a little light a taper cast,<br> And showed a fair bed by the window-side;<br> Therewith at last turned round the dreary guide,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, "O thou to whom night still is night<br> And day is day, bide here until the morn,<br> And take some little of that dear delight,<br> That we for many a long day have outworn.<br> Sleep, and forget awhile that thou wast born, <A NAME="page_219"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 219</FONT></A><br> And on the morrow will I come to thee<br> To show thee what thy life with us must be."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with that word he went, and though at first<br> The other thought that he should never sleep<br> For wondering what had made that house accursed,<br> And sunk that seeming bliss in woe so deep,<br> Yet o&#146;er his soul forgetfulness did creep,<br> And in a dreamless slumber long he lay,<br> Not knowing when the sun brought back the day.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in broad daylight of the following morn<br> He woke, and o&#146;er him saw his fellow stand,<br> Who seemed, if it could be, yet more forlorn<br> Than when he last reached out to him his hand.<br> But now he said, "Come thou and see the band<br> Of folk that thou shalt dwell with, and the home<br> Whereto, fate leading thee, thou now hast come."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rose without a word, and went with him<br> Who led the way through pillared passages,<br> Dainty with marble walls, made cool and dim<br> By the o&#146;erhanging boughs of thick-leaved trees<br> That brushed against their windows in the breeze,<br> And still the work of one all seemed to be<br> Who had a mind to mock eternity.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too lovely seemed that place for any one<br> But youths and damsels, who, not growing old, <A NAME="page_220"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 220</FONT></A><br> Should dwell there, knowing not the scorching sun,<br> Without a name for misery or cold,<br> Without a use for glittering steel or gold<br> Except adornment, and content withal,<br> Though change or passion there should ne&#146;er befall.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still despite his fellow's woeful face,<br> And that sad cry that smote him yesternight,<br> The strange luxurious perfume of that place,<br> Where everything seemed wrought for mere delight,<br> Still made his heart beat, and his eyes wax bright<br> With delicate desires new-born again,<br> In that sweet rest from poverty and pain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, looking through the windows there askance,<br> He yet had something like a hope to see<br> The garden blossom into feast and dance,<br> Or, turning round a corner suddenly,<br> Mid voices sweet, and perfumed gowns to be,<br> Bewildered by white limbs and glittering eyes,<br> Striving to learn love's inmost mysteries.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as they went, unto a door they came<br> That Firuz opened, showing a great hall<br> Whose walls with wealth of strange-wrought gold did flame<br> Through a cool twilight, for the light did fall<br> From windows in the dome high up and small,<br> And Bharam's lustful hope was quenched in fear,<br> As he, low moaning and faint sobs could hear. <A NAME="page_221"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 221</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped and shut his eyes, oppressed with awe,<br> Thinking the rites of some sad god to see&#151;<br> The secrets of some blood-stained hidden law&#151;<br> But Firuz grasped his arm impatiently,<br> And drew him in. "O friend, look up!" said he,<br> "Nought dwelleth here but man's accursed race,<br> And thou art far the mightiest in this place."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he, though trembling still, looked up, and there<br> Beheld six men clad even as his guide,<br> Who sat upon a bench of marble fair<br> Against the wall, and some their eyes must hide<br> When they met his, and some rose up and cried<br> Words inarticulate, then sank again<br> Into their places, as out-worn with pain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one against the wall, with head back thrown,<br> Was leaning, and his eyes wide open stared,<br> And by his side his nerveless hands hung down,<br> Nor showed his face a glimmer of surprise,<br> Deaf was he to the wisest of the wise,<br> Speechless though open-mouthed; for there sat he,<br> Dead midst the living slaves of misery.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bharam stared at him, wondering, still in dread;<br> But no heed took his fellows of his case,<br> Till Firuz, with a side-glance at him, said,<br> &#147;Why mourn ye more that yet another face<br> Must see our shame and sorrow in this place? <A NAME="page_222"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 222</FONT></A><br> Do ye not know this worldly man is come<br> To lay the last one of us in his home?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;And now in turn another soul is gone,<br> Get ready then to bear him forth straightway.<br> Be patient, for the heavy days crawl on!<br> But thou, O friend, I pray thee from this day<br> Help thou us helpless men, who cannot pray<br> Even to die; no long time will it be<br> Ere we shall leave this countless wealth to thee.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Behold, a master, not a slave, we need,<br> For we, I say, have neither will to die<br> Nor yet to live, yet will we pay good heed<br> To thy commands, still doing patiently<br> Our daily tasks, as the dull time goes by;<br> Drive us like beasts, yea, slay us if thou wilt,<br> Nor will our souls impute to thee the guilt.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yet ask us not to tell thee of our tale,<br> Why we are brought unto this sad estate,<br> Nor for the rest will any words avail<br> To make us flee from this lone house, where fate<br> With all its cruel sport will we await;<br> Lo, now thy task, O fellow, in return<br> A mighty kingdom's wealth thou soon shalt earn."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as he spoke, a hard forgetfulness<br> Of his own lot, the rich man's cruel pride, <A NAME="page_223"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 223</FONT></A><br> Smote Bharam's heart, he thought, "What dire distress<br> Could make me cast all hope of life aside?<br> Could aught but death my life and will divide:<br> Surely this mood of theirs will pass away<br> And these walls yet may see a merry day."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So thought he, yet, beholding them again,<br> And seeing them so swallowed up with woe<br> That they scarce heeded him, a pang of pain<br> Like pleasure's death throughout his heart did go;<br> And therewithal a strong desire to know<br> The utmost of their tale possessed his mind<br> And made him scorn an easy life and blind.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So midst his silence neither spoke they aught,<br> Firuz himself, as one, who having laid<br> His charge upon another, may take thought<br> Of l is own miseries, sat with head downweighed,<br> With tears that would not flow; then Bharam said,<br> "Masters, I bid you rise and do your best<br> To give your fellow's body its due rest!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rose up at his words and straight began,<br> As men who oft had had such things to do,<br> To dress the body of the just-dead man<br> For his last resting-place, then two and two<br> They bore it forth, passing the chambers through,<br> Where Bharam on that morn had hoped to see<br> Fair folk that had no name for misery. <A NAME="page_224"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 224</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then through the sunny pleasance slow they passed,<br> That sweet with flowers behind the palace lay,<br> Until they reached a thick, black wood at last,<br> Bounding the garden as the night bounds day,<br> And through a narrow path they took their way,<br> Less like to men than shadows in a dream,<br> Till the wood ended at a swift broad stream,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the boughs dark green it ran, and deep,<br> Well-nigh awash with the wood's tangled grass,<br> But on the other side wall-like and steep,<br> Straight from the gurgling eddies, rose a mass<br> Of dark grey cliff; no man unhelped could pass;<br> But a low door e&#146;en in the very base<br> Was set, above the water's hurrying race.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of iron seemed that door to Bharam's eyes,<br> Heavily wrought, and closely locked it seemed;<br> But as he stared thereon strange thoughts would rise<br> Within his heart, until he well-nigh deemed<br> That he in morning sleep of such things dreamed,<br> And dreamed that he had seen all this before,<br> Wood and deep river, cliff, and close-shut door.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in the stream, and close unto his feet,<br> A boat there lay, as though for wafting o&#146;er<br> Whoso had will such doubtful things to meet<br> As that strange door might hide; and on the shore,<br> About the path, a rod of ground or more <A NAME="page_225"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 225</FONT></A><br> Was cleared of wood, in which space here and there<br> Low changing mounds told of dead men anear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there that doleful company made stay,<br> And &#146;twixt the trees and swift stream hurrying by,<br> Their brother's body in the earth did lay.<br> Nor ever to the cliff would raise an eye,<br> But trembling, as with added agony,<br> Did their dull task as swiftly as they could,<br> Then went their way again amidst the wood.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>NOW with these dreary folk must Bharam live<br> Henceforward, doing even as he would;<br> And many a joy the palace had to give<br> To such a man as e&#146;en could find life good<br> So prisoned, and with nought to stir the blood,<br> And seeing still from weary day to day<br> These wretched mourners cast their lives away.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet came deliverance; one by one they died,<br> E&#146;en as new-come he saw that man die first,<br> And so were buried by the river-side.<br> And ever as he saw these men accurst<br> Vanish from life, he grew the more athirst<br> To know what evil deed had been their bane,<br> But still were all his prayers therefor in vain. <A NAME="page_226"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 226</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His utmost will in all things else they did,<br> Serving as slaves if he demanded aught,<br> But in grim silence still their story hid;<br> Nor did he fare the better when he sought<br> In the fair parchments that scribes' hands had wrought<br> Within that house. Of many a tale they told;<br> But none the tale of that sad life did hold.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore in silence he consumed his days<br> Until a weary year had clean gone by<br> Since first upon that palace he did gaze,<br> And all that doleful band had he seen die,<br> Except Firuz; and ever eagerly<br> Did Bharam watch him, lest he too should go,<br> And make an end of all he longed to know.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last a day came when the mourner said,<br> "Beneath the ground my woe thou soon shalt lay,<br> And all our foolish sorrow shall be dead;<br> Come then, I fain would show thee the straight way<br> Through which we came the night of that passed day<br> When first I brought thee here. This knowledge thine,<br> Guard thou this house, and use it as a mine;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"While safe thou dwellest in some city fair,&#151;<br> Hasten, for little strength is in me now!"<br> But Bharam thought, "Yet will he not lay bare<br> His story to me utterly, and show<br> What-thing it was that brought these men so low." <A NAME="page_227"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 227</FONT></A><br> Yet said he nought, but from the house they went,<br> While painfully the mourner on him leant.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the wood gained, by many glades they passed<br> That Firuz heeded not, though they were wide,<br> Until they reached a certain one at last,<br> Whereon he said, "Here did we come that tide;<br> I counsel thee no longer to abide<br> When I am dead, but mount my mule and go,<br> Nor doubt the beast the doubtful way shall know.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"She too shall serve thee when thou com&#146;st again,<br> With many men, and sumpter mules enow<br> To gather up the wealth we held in vain,&#151;<br> Turn me, I would depart! fainter I grow!<br> And thou the road to happy life dost know.<br> Alas, my feet are heavy! nor can I<br> Go any further. Lay me down to die!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then &#146;gainst a tree-root Bharam laid his head,<br> Saying, "Fear not, thou hast been good to me,<br> And by the river-side, when thou art dead,<br> I will not fail to lay thee certainly!"<br> "Nay, nay," he said, &#147;what matter&#151;let it be!<br> I bring the dismal rite unto an end.<br> Hide my bones here, and toward thy city wend!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Better perchance that thou beholdest not<br> That place once more, our misery and bane!" <A NAME="page_228"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 228</FONT></A><br> Then at that word did Bharam's heart wax hot;<br> He seemed at point his whole desire to gain.<br> He cried aloud, "Nay, surely all in vain<br> Thy secret hast thou hidden till this day,<br> Since to the mystic road thou showest the way!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My will is weak," his friend said, "thine is strong;<br> Draw near, and I will tell thee all the tale,<br> If this my feeble voice will last so long.<br> Perchance my dying words may yet avail<br> To make thee wise. This pouch of golden scale,<br> Open thou it. The gold key hid therein<br> Opens the story of our foolish sin.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How thy face flushes, holding it! Just so,<br> As by that door I stood, did my face burn<br> That summer morning past so long ago.<br> Draw nigher still if thou the tale wouldst learn.<br> I scarce can speak now, and withal I yearn<br> To die at last, and leave the thing unsaid.<br> Raise thou me up, or I shall soon be dead!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fellow raised him trembling, nor durst speak<br> Lest he should scare his feeble life away,<br> Then from his mouth came wailing words, and weak:<br> "Where art thou then, O loveliest one, to-day?<br> Beneath the odorous boughs that gladden May,<br> Laid in the thymy hollow of some hill,<br> Dost thou remember me a little still? <A NAME="page_229"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 229</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can kindness such as thine was, vanish quite<br> And be forgotten? Ah, if I forget,<br> Canst thou forget the love and fresh delight<br> That held thee then&#151;my love that even yet<br> Midst other love must make thy sweet eyes wet,<br> At least sometimes, at least when heaven and earth<br> In some fair eve are grown too fair for mirth?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O joy departed, know&#146;st thou how at first<br> I prayed in vain, and strove with hope to dull<br> My ravening hunger, mock my quenchless thirst?<br> And know&#146;st thou not how when my life was full<br> Of nought but pain, I strove asleep to lull<br> My longing for the eyeless, hopeless rest,<br> Lest even yet strange chance should bring the best?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell, farewell, beloved! I depart,<br> But hope, once dead, now liveth though I die,<br> Whispering of marvels to my fainting heart&#151;<br> Perchance the memory of some written lie,<br> Perchance the music of the rest anigh;<br> I know not&#151;but farewell, be no more sad!<br> For life and love that has been, I am glad."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ceased, and his friend, trembling, faintly said&#151;<br> "Wilt thou not speak to me, what hast thou done?'<br> But even as he spoke, the mourner's head<br> Fell backward, and his troubled soul was gone;<br> And Bharam, in the forest left alone, <A NAME="page_230"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 230</FONT></A><br> Durst scarcely move at first for very fear,<br> And longing for the tale he was to hear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in a while the body down he laid,<br> And swiftly gat him o&#146;er the hot dry plain,<br> And through the garden, as a man afraid,<br> Went softly, and the golden porch did gain,<br> And from the wealth those men had held in vain,<br> Most precious things he did not spare to take<br> For his new life and joyous freedom's sake.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So doing he came round unto the door<br> That led out to the passage through the wood,<br> Wherethrough the mourners erst their dead ones bore<br> Down to the river; but as there he stood<br> He felt a new fire kindling in his blood;<br> His sack he laid aside, and touched the key<br> That could unlock that dreadful history;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his friend's words, that loving tender voice<br> He sent forth ere he died, smote on his heart:<br> How could he leave those dead men and rejoice<br> With folk who in their story had no part?<br> Yea, as he lingered did the hot tears start<br> Into his eyes, he wept, and knew not why;<br> Some pleasure seemed within his grasp to lie,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could not grasp or name, and none the less<br> He muttered to himself, "I must be gone <A NAME="page_231"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 231</FONT></A><br> Or I shall die in this fair wilderness,<br> That every minute seems to grow more lone;<br> Why do I stand here like a man of stone?"<br> And with that very word he moved indeed,<br> But took the path that toward the stream did lead.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly he walked with pale face downward bent,<br> As &#146;twixt the trembling tulip-beds he passed,<br> Until a horror seized him as he went,<br> And, turning toward the house, he ran full fast,<br> Nor, till he reached it, one look backward cast;<br> And by the gathered treasure, left behind<br> Awhile ago, he stood confused, half blind.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then slowly did he lift the precious weight,<br> Yet lingered still. "Ah, must I go?" he said,<br> "Have I no heart to meet that unknown fate?<br> And must I lead the life that once I led,<br> Midst folk who will rejoice when I am dead;<br> Even as if they had not shared with me<br> The fear and longing of felicity?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And yet indeed if I must live alone,<br> If fellowship is but an empty dream,<br> Is there not left a world that is mine own?<br> Am I not real, if all else doth but seem?<br> Yea, rather, with what wealth the world doth teem,<br> When we are once content from us to cast<br> The dreadful future and remorseful past." <A NAME="page_232"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 232</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while he lingered yet, and then<br> As fearful what he might be tempted to,<br> He hurried on until he reached again<br> The outer door, and, sighing, passed therethrough,<br> But still made haste to do what he must do,<br> And found the mule and cast on her the sack,<br> And took his way to that lone forest-track.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mattock and spade with him too did he bear,<br> And dug a grave beneath the spreading tree<br> Whereby Firuz had died, and laid him there,<br> Thinking the while of all his misery,<br> And muttering still, "How could it hap to me?<br> Unless I died within a day or two<br> Surely some deed I soon should find to do."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the earth on him he &#146;gan to throw,<br> He said, "And shall I cast the key herein?<br> What need have I this woeful tale to know,<br> To vex me midst the fair life I shall win;<br> Why do I seek to probe my fellow's sin,<br> Who, living, saved my life from misery,<br> And dying, gave this fresh life unto me?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kept the key, his words he answered not,<br> But smoothed the earth above the mourner's head,<br> Then mounting, turned away from that sad spot,<br> Feverish with hope and change, bewildered,<br> And ever more oppressed with growing dread, <A NAME="page_233"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 233</FONT></A><br> As through the dark and silent wood he rode,<br> And drew the nigher unto man's abode.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when at last he met the broad sweet light<br> Upon the hill's brow where that wood had end,<br> And saw the open upland fresh and bright,<br> A thrill of joy that sight through him must send,<br> And with good heart he &#146;twixt the fields did wend,<br> And not so much of that sad house he thought<br> As of the wealthy life he thence had brought;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So amidst thoughts of pleasant life and ease,<br> Seemed all things fair that eve; the peasant's door,<br> The mother with the child upon her knees<br> Sitting within upon the shaded floor;<br> While &#146;neath the trellised gourd some maid sung o&#146;er<br> Her lover to the rude lute's trembling strings,<br> Her brown breast heaving &#146;neath the silver rings;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slender damsel coming from the well,<br> Smiling beneath the flashing brazen jar,<br> Her fellows left behind thereat, to tell<br> How weary of her smiles her lovers are;<br> While the small children round wage watery war<br> Till the thin linen more transparent grows,<br> And ruddy brown the flesh beneath it glows;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trooper drinking at the homestead gate,<br> Telling wild lies about the sword and spear, <A NAME="page_234"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 234</FONT></A><br> Unto the farmer striving to abate<br> The pedler's price; the village drawing near,<br> The smoke, that scenting the fresh eve, and clear,<br> Tells of the feast; the stithy's dying spark,<br> The barn's wealth dimly showing through the dark.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How sweet was all! how easy it should be<br> Amid such life one's self-made woes to bear!<br> He felt as one who, waked up suddenly<br> To life's delight, knows not of grief or care.<br> How kind, how lovesome, all the people were!<br> Why should he think of aught but love and bliss<br> With many years of such-like life as this?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night came at last, and darker and more still<br> The world was, and the stars hung in the sky,<br> And as the road o&#146;ertopped a sunburnt hill<br> He saw before him the great city lie,<br> The glimmering lights about grey towers and high,<br> Rising from gardens dark; the guarded wall,<br> The gleaming dykes, the great sea, bounding all.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who at the trumpet's sound casts by<br> The tender thought of rest, of wife and child,<br> And fear of death for hope of victory,<br> So at that sight those sweet vague hopes and wild<br> Did he cast by, and in the darkness smiled<br> For pleasure of the beauty of the earth,<br> For foretaste of the coming days of mirth.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_235"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 235</FONT></A></p>  
<p>SURELY if any man was blithe and glad<br> Within that city, when the morrow's sun<br> Beheld it, he at least the first place had,<br> And midst of glad folk was the happiest one&#151;<br> So much to do, that was not e&#146;en begun,<br> So much to hope for, that he could not see,<br> So much to win, so many things to be!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, so much, he could turn himself to nought<br> For many days, but wandering aimlessly<br> Wherever men together might be brought,<br> That he once more their daily life might see,<br> That to his new-born life new seemed to be,<br> And staving thought off, he awhile must shrink<br> From touching that sweet cup he had to drink.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet when this mood was past by, what was this,<br> That in the draught he was about to drain,<br> That new victorious life, all seemed amiss?<br> If, thinking of the pleasure and the pain,<br> Men find in struggling life, he turned to gain<br> The godlike joy he hoped to find therein,<br> All turned to cloud, and nought seemed left to win.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love moved him not, yea, something in his heart<br> There was that made him shudder at its name; <A NAME="page_236"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 236</FONT></A><br> He could not rouse himself to take his part<br> In ruling worlds and winning praise and blame;<br> And if vague hope of glory o&#146;er him came,<br> Why should he cast himself against the spears<br> To make vain stories for the unpitying years?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing that men call knowledge moved him not,<br> And if he thought of the world's varying face,<br> And changing manners, then his heart waxed hot<br> For thinking of his journey to that place,<br> And how &#146;twixt him and it was little space,<br> Then back to listlessness once more he turned,<br> Quenching the flame that in his sick heart burned.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What thing was left him now, but only this,<br> A life of aimless ease and luxury,<br> That he must strive to think the promised bliss,<br> Where hoping not for aught that was not nigh,<br> Midst vain pretence he should but have to die,<br> But every minute longing to confess<br> That this was nought but utter weariness.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to the foolish image of delight<br> That rich men worship, now he needs must cling<br> Despite himself, and pass by day and night<br> As friendless and unloved as any king;<br> Till he began to doubt of everything<br> Amidst that world of lies; till he began<br> To think of pain as very friend of man. <A NAME="page_237"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 237</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So passed the time, and though he felt the chain<br> That round about his wasting life, was cast,<br> He still must think the labour all in vain<br> To strive to free himself while life should last,<br> And so, midst all, two weary years went past,<br> Nought done, save death a little brought anear,<br> The hard deliverance that he needs must fear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last one dawn, when all the place was still,<br> He took that key, and e&#146;en as one might gaze<br> Upon the record of some little ill<br> That happed in past days, now grown happy days,<br> He eyed it, sighing, &#146;neath the young sun's rays;<br> And silently he passed his palace through,<br> Nor told himself what deed he had to do.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached the stable where his steeds were kept,<br> And &#146;midst the delicate-limbed beasts he found<br> The mule that o&#146;er the forest grass had stepped,<br> Then, having on her back the saddle bound,<br> Entered the house again, and, looking round<br> The darkened banquet-chamber, caught away<br> What simple food the nighest to him lay.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, with the hand that rich men fawned upon,<br> The wicket he unlocked, and forth he led<br> His beast, and mounted when the street was won,<br> Wherein already folk for daily bread<br> Began to labour, who now turned the head <A NAME="page_238"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 238</FONT></A><br> To whisper as the rich man passed them by<br> Betwixt the frails of fresh-plucked greenery.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He passed the wall where Firuz first he saw,<br> The hostel where the dead man gave him food;<br> He passed the gate and &#146;gan at last to draw<br> Unto the country bordering on the wood,<br> And still he took no thought of bad or good,<br> Or named his journey, nay, if he had met<br> A face he knew, he might have turned back yet.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all the folk he saw were strange to him,<br> And, for all heed that unto them he gave,<br> Might have been nought; the reaper's bare brown limb,<br> The rich man's train with litter and armed slave,<br> The girl bare-footed in the stream's white wave&#151;<br> Like empty shadows by his eyes they passed,<br> The world was narrowed to his heart at last.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached the hill, which e&#146;en in that strange mood<br> Seemed grown familiar to him, with no pain<br> He found the path that pierced the tangled wood,<br> And midst its dusk he gave his mule the reins<br> And in no long time reached the little plain,<br> And then indeed the world seemed left behind,<br> And no more now he felt confused and blind.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cried aloud to see the white house rise<br> O&#146;er the green garden and the long white wall, <A NAME="page_239"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 239</FONT></A><br> Which erst the pale moon showed his wondering eyes,<br> But on the stillness strange his voice did fall,<br> For in the noon now woodland creatures all<br> Were resting &#146;neath the shadow of the trees,<br> Patient, unvexed by any memories.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How should he rest, who might have come too late?<br> O&#146;er the burnt plain he hurried, and laid hand<br> Upon the rusted handle of the gate,<br> Not touched since he himself thereby did stand,<br> The warm and scented air his visage fanned,<br> And on his head down rained the blossoms&#146; dust,<br> As back the heavy grass-choked door he thrust.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ere upon the path grown green with weed<br> 'He set his foot, he paused a little while,<br> And of her gear his patient beast he freed,<br> And muttered, as he smiled a doubtful smile,<br> "Behold now if my troubles make me vile,<br> And I once more have will to herd with man,<br> Let me get back, then, even as I can."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There &#146;neath the tangled boughs he went apace,<br> Remembering him awhile of that sad cry,<br> That erst had been his welcome to that place,<br> That showed him first it might be good to die,<br> When he but thought of new delights anigh;<br> Thereat he shuddered now, bethinking him<br> In what a sea he cast himself to swim. <A NAME="page_240"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 240</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his fate lay before him, on he went,<br> And through the gilded doors, now open wide,<br> He passed, and found the flowery hangings rent,<br> And past his feet did hissing serpents glide,<br> While from the hall wherein the mourners died<br> A grey wolf glared, and o&#146;er his head the bat<br> Hung, and the paddock on the hearth-stone sat.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loitered not amid those loathsome things,<br> That in the place which erst had been so fair,<br> Brought second death to fond imaginings<br> Of that sweet life, he once had hoped for there;<br> So with a troubled heart and full of care,<br> Though still with wild hopes stirring his hot blood,<br> He turned his face unto the dreary wood.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No less the pleasance felt its evil day;<br> The trellis, that had shut the forest trees<br> From the fair flowers, all torn and broken lay,<br> Though still the lily's scent was on the breeze,<br> And the rose clasped the broken images<br> Of kings and priests, and those they once had loved,<br> And in the scented bush the brown bird moved.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the choking weeds the tulip fought,<br> Paler and smaller than he had been erst<br> The wind-flowers round the well, fair feet once sought,<br> Were trodden down by feet of beasts athirst;<br> The well-trained apricot its bonds had burst; <A NAME="page_241"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 241</FONT></A><br> The wild-cat in the cherry-tree anear<br> Eyed the brown lynx that waited for the deer.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while upon the black wood's edge<br> Did Bharam eye the ruin mournfully,<br> Then turned and said, "I take it as a pledge<br> That I shall not come back again to die;<br> The mocking image of felicity<br> Awaited those poor souls that failed herein,<br> But I most surely death or life shall win."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus saying, through the wood he &#146;gan to go,<br> And kindlier its black loneliness did seem<br> Than all the fairness ruin brought so low;<br> So with good heart he reached the swift full stream,<br> And there, as in an old unfinished dream,<br> He stood among the mourners' graves and saw<br> Past the small boat the eddies seaward draw.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly, as one who thinks not of his deed,<br> He gat into the boat, and loosed from shore,<br> And &#146;gan to row the ready shallop freed<br> Unto the landing cut beneath the door,<br> And in a little minute stood before<br> Its rusty leaves with beating heart, and hand<br> His wavering troubled will could scarce command.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But almost ere he willed it, was the key<br> Within the lock, and the great bolt sprang back, <A NAME="page_242"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 242</FONT></A><br> The iron door swung open heavily,<br> And cold the wind rushed from a cavern black:<br> Then with one look upon the woodland track,<br> He stepped from out the fair light of the day,<br> Casting all hope of common life away.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For at his back the heavy door swung to,<br> Before him was thick darkness palpable;<br> And as he struggled further on to go,<br> With dizzied head upon the ground he fell,<br> And if he lived on yet, he scarce could tell,<br> Amid the phantoms new born in that place<br> That past his eyes &#146;gan flit in endless race.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair women changing into shapeless things,<br> His own sad face mirrored, he knew not how,<br> And heavy wingless birds, and beasts with wings,<br> Strange stars, huge swirling seas, whose ebb and flow<br> Now seemed too swift for thought, now dull and slow:<br> Such things emmeshed his dying troubled thought,<br> Until his soul to sightless sleep was brought.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he woke to languid consciousness<br> Too well content he was therewith at first,<br> To ope his eyes, or seek what things might bless<br> His soul with rest from thought of good and worst,<br> And still his faint incurious ease he nursed,<br> Till nigh him rang a bird's note sweet and clear,<br> And stirred in him the seeds of hope and fear. <A NAME="page_243"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 243</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withal the murmur of a quiet sea<br> He heard, and mingled sounds far off and sweet,<br> And o&#146;er his head some rustling summer tree;<br> Slowly thereon he gat unto his feet,<br> And therewithal his sleep-dazed eyes did meet<br> The westering golden splendour of the sun,<br> For on that fair shore day was well-nigh done.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from the flashing sea and gleaming sky<br> Unto the green earth did he turn him round,<br> And saw a fair land sloping lazily<br> Up to a ridge of green with grey rocks crowned,<br> And on those slopes did fruitful trees abound,<br> And, cleaving them, came downward from the hill<br> In many a tinkling fall a little rill.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with his wakening senses, hunger too<br> Must needs awake, parched did his dry throat feel,<br> And hurrying, toward the little stream he drew,<br> And by a clear and sandy pool did kneel<br> And quenched his thirst, the while his hand did steal<br> Unto his wallet, where he thought to find<br> The bread he snatched from vain wealth left behind.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when within his hand he held that bread,<br> Mouldy and perished as with many days,<br> He wondered much that he had not been dead,<br> And fell to think with measureless amaze<br> By what unheard-of, unimagined ways <A NAME="page_244"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 244</FONT></A><br> Unto that lonely land he had been brought;<br> Until, bewildered in the maze of thought</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That needs could lead nowhither, he arose<br> And from the fairest of those fruit-hung trees<br> The ripest and most luscious seeds he chose,<br> And staved his hunger off awhile with these;<br> Then &#146;twixt their trunks got back to where the breeze<br> Blew cool from off the calm sea, thinking still<br> That thence his fate must come for good or ill.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, looking unto right and left, he passed<br> Over the green-sward, till he reached the strand,<br> And nought was &#146;twixt the sea and him at last,<br> Except a lessening belt of yellow sand.<br> There, looking seaward, he awhile did stand,<br> Until at last the great sun's nether rim,<br> Red with the sea-mist, in the sea &#146;gan swim.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But &#146;gainst it now a spot did he behold,<br> Nor knew if he were dazzled with the light,<br> Till as the orb sank and the sea grew cold,<br> Greater that grew beneath the gathering night,<br> And when all red was gone, and clear and bright<br> The high moon was, beneath its light he saw<br> A ship unto him o&#146;er the waters draw.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly his heart &#146;gan beat at sight of it,<br> But what that he could do could change his fate? <A NAME="page_245"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 245</FONT></A><br> So calmly on the turf's edge did he sit<br> The coming of that unknown keel to wait,<br> That o&#146;er the moonlit sea kept growing great,<br> Until at last the dashing oars he heard,<br> The creaking yard, the master's shouted word.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then as the black hull &#146;neath the moonlight lay,<br> In the long swell, bright against side and oar,<br> A little shallop therefrom took its way<br> Unto the low line of the breakers hoar,<br> And when its keel was firm upon the shore<br> Two women stepped out thence, and &#146;gan to go<br> To Bharam's place with gentle steps and slow.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he arose, and wondering what should be<br> The end hereof, stood gazing at them there,<br> And even in that doubtful light could see<br> That they were lovesome damsels young and fair;<br> And as he watched their garlanded loose hair<br> And dainty flutter of their rich array,<br> Full many a hope about his heart &#146;gan play.&#151;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they drew nigh, and one of them began<br> In a sweet voice these hopeful words to say,<br> "Fear not, but come with us, O happy man,<br> Nor with thy doubts or questions make delay;<br> For this soft night gets ready such a day,<br> As shall thy heart for feeble pining blame,<br> And call thy hot desire a languid shame." <A NAME="page_246"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 246</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith she turned again unto the sea,<br> As though she doubted not what he would do,<br> And Bharam followed after silently,<br> And went aboard the shallop with the two,<br> As one who dreams; and as the prow cleft through<br> The grey waves, sat beside them, pondering o&#146;er<br> The days grown dim that led to that strange shore.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None spake to him, the mariners toiled on,<br> Silent the damsels sat, hand joined to hand,<br> Until the black sides of the ship were won;<br> Then folk hauled up the boat, his feet did stand<br> On the wide deck, the master gave command,<br> Back went the oars, and o&#146;er the waters wan,<br> Unto the west &#146;neath sail and oar she ran.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All night they sailed, and when the dawn was nigh<br> And far astern the eastern sky grew bright,<br> A dark line seemed to cross the western sky<br> Afar and faint, and with the growing light<br> Another land began to heave in sight,<br> And when the lingering twilight was all done,<br> Grey cliffs they saw, made ruddy with the sun.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the shadow of their well-shaved mast<br> Had shortened that it no more touched the sea,<br> And well-nigh all the windy waste was past<br> That kept them from the land where they would be,<br> They turned about a ness, and &#146;neath their lee <A NAME="page_247"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 247</FONT></A><br> A sandy-beached and green-banked haven lay,<br> For there a river cleft the mountains grey.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thither they steered with no delay, and then<br> Upon the green slopes Bharam could behold<br> The white tents and the spears of many men,<br> And on the o&#146;erhanging height a castle old,<br> And up the bay a ship o&#146;erlaid with gold,<br> With golden sails and fluttering banners bright,<br> And silken awnings &#146;gainst the hot sun dight.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But underneath the tents, anigh that ship,<br> A space there was amidst of shadowing trees,<br> Well clad with turf down to the haven's lip;<br> And there, amongst the pasture of the bees,<br> Fanned by the long-drawn sweet-breathed ocean-breeze,<br> Well canopied, was set a wondrous throne,<br> Amidst whose cushions sat a maid alone.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowned as a queen was she, and round her seat<br> Were damsels gathered, clad just in such guise<br> As those who on the sands did Bharam meet,<br> And stood beside him now, with lovesome eyes.<br> All this saw Bharam in no other wise<br> Than one might see a dream becoming true,<br> Nor had he thought of what he next should do.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only those longings, vague and aimless erst,<br> Now quickened tenfold, found a cause and aim, <A NAME="page_248"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 248</FONT></A><br> And on his soul a flood of light outburst,<br> That swallowed up in brightness of its flame<br> Strange thoughts of death, and hopes without a name,<br> For now he knew that love had led him on,<br> Until&#151;until, perchance, the end was won.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto that presence straight the shipmen steered,<br> And as the white foam from the oars did fly,<br> And the black prow the daisied green-sward neared,<br> Uprose a song from that fair company,<br> Which those two damsels echoed murmuringly,<br> Bearing love-laden words unto his ears<br> On tender music, mother of sweet tears.</p>  
<p align="center">SONG.</p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O thou who drawest nigh across the sea,<br> O heart that seekest Love perpetually,<br> Nor know&#146;st his name, come now at last to me!</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, thirst of love thy lips too long have borne,<br> Hunger of love thy heart hath long outworn,<br> Speech hadst thou but to call thyself forlorn.</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The seeker finds now, the parched lips are led<br> To sweet full streams, the hungry heart is fed,<br> And song springs up from moans of sorrow dead</i>. <A NAME="page_249"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 249</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Draw nigh, draw nigh, and tell me all thy tale;<br> In words grown sweet since all the woe doth fail,<br> Show me wherewith thou didst thy woe bewail.</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Draw nigh, draw nigh, beloved! think of these<br> That stand around as well-wrought images,<br> Earless and eyeless as these trembling trees.</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the sky calls living none but three:<br> The God that looketh thence and thee and me;<br> And He made us, but we made Love to be.</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think not of time, then, for thou shalt not die,<br> How soon soever shall the world go by,<br> And nought be left but God and thou and I.</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, O love, why makes! thou delay,<br> Life comes not till thou comes, and the day<br> That knows no end may yet be cast away?</i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such words the summer air swept past his ears,<br> Such words the lovesome maidens murmured,<br> With unabashed soft eyes made wet with tears,<br> As though for them the world were really dead,<br> As though indeed those tender words they said<br> Each to her love, and each her fingers moved,<br> As though she thought to meet the hands she loved. <A NAME="page_250"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 250</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Bharam heeded not their lonesomeness,<br> As through his heart there shot one bitter thought<br> Of those dead mourners and their dead distress<br> That his own feet to such a land had brought,<br> But even ere the fear had come to nought,<br> The thought that made it, yea, all memory<br> Of what had been, had utterly passed by.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the song was done, and on the strand<br> The bark's prow grated, and the maidens twain<br> In low words bade him follow them aland,<br> Still, mid the certain hope of boundless gain,<br> About him clung the seeming-causeless pain<br> Of that past thought, that love had driven away,<br> The dreary teaching of a hopeless day.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as unto the throne he drew anigh<br> He tried to say unto himself; "Alas!<br> Why am I full of such felicity?<br> How know I that for me the music was?<br> How know I yet what thing will come to pass?<br> How know I that my heart can bear the best,<br> Vain foolish heart that knew but little rest?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment more and toward that golden ship<br> His face was turned, a hand was holding his;<br> His eyes with happy tears were wet, his lip<br> Still thrilled with memory of a loving kiss,<br> His eager ears drank in melodious bliss <A NAME="page_251"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 251</FONT></A><br> Past words to tell of; joy was born at last,<br> Surely the bitterness of death was past.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can I give her image unto you,<br> Clad in that raiment wonderful and fair?<br> What need? Be sure that love's eye pierceth through<br> What web soever hides the beauty there&#151;<br> To tell her fairness? Measure forth the air,<br> And weigh the wind, and portion out the sun!<br> This still is left, less easy to be done.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the golden ship now passed the twain,<br> he maidens followed, and the soldiers moved<br> Their ordered ranks, the shoreward road to gain;<br> The minstrels played what tunes the best behoved,<br> While in the stern the lover and beloved<br> Had nought to do but each on each to gaze,<br> Without a thought of past or coming days.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up stream the gold prow pointed, the long oars<br> Broke into curves of white the swirling green,<br> On each side opened out the changing shores;<br> So lovely there were all things to be seen,<br> That in the golden age they might have been;<br> But rather had he gaze upon those eyes<br> Than see the whole world freed from miseries.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes she said, "And this, O love, is thine<br> As thou art mine. Look forth thy land to see!" <A NAME="page_252"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 252</FONT></A><br> But he looked not, but rather would entwine<br> His fingers in her fingers amorously,<br> And answer, "Yea, and that one day shall be<br> When thou shalt go upon the blossoms sweet,<br> And I must look thereon to see thy feet!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the stream narrowed, and the country girls<br> Thronged on the banks to see the Queen go by,<br> And cast fresh flowers upon the weedy swirls.<br> "Look forth! they sing to our felicity!"<br> The Queen said, "And the city draweth nigh."<br> "Nay, nay," said Bharam, "I will look on them<br> When they shall kneel to kiss thy garment's hem."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now far ahead, above dark banks of trees<br> Could they behold the city's high white wall,<br> And, as they neared it, on the summer breeze<br> Was borne the tumult of the festival;<br> And when that sound on Bharam's ears did fall,<br> He cried, "Ah, will they lengthen out the day,<br> E&#146;en when kind night has drawn the sun away?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sighed and said, "Nay now, be glad, O king,<br> That thou art coming to thy very own;<br> Nor one day shalt thou think it a small thing<br> That thou therein mayst wear the royal crown<br> When somewhat weary thou at last art grown,<br> Through lapse of days, of this and this and this&#151;<br> That something more is left thee than a kiss." <A NAME="page_253"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 253</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stared at her wide eyes as one who heard<br> Yet knew not what the words might signify,<br> Then said, "And think&#146;st thou I shall be afeard<br> To slay myself before our love goes by,<br> That changed by death, if we indeed can die,<br> Unwearied by this anxious, earthy frame,<br> I still may think of thee, and know no shame?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gazed upon his flushed face tenderly,<br> Reddening herself for love, but said not aught,<br> Only her bosom heaved with one soft sigh,<br> And some unravelled maze of troublous thought<br> Unbidden tears unto her sweet eyes brought;<br> And he forgot that shade of bitterness<br> When such a look his yearning heart did bless.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereat the silver trumpet's tuneful blare<br> Made music strange unto his lovesome dream,<br> For now before them lay the city fair,<br> With high white bridges spanning the swift stream,<br> And bridge and shore with wealth of gold did gleam.<br> From a great multitude shout followed shout,<br> And high in air the sound of bells leapt out.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the shipmen furled the golden sail&#151;<br> Slowly the red oars o&#146;er the stream did skim,<br> As &#146;twixt the houses the light wind &#146;gan fail,<br> Till by a palace on the river's brim,<br> Whose towering height made half the bells grow dim, <A NAME="page_254"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 254</FONT></A><br> The golden ship was stayed, for they had come<br> Unto the happy seeker's wondrous home.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look up and wonder, well-beloved," she said,<br> As now they rose to go unto the shore,<br> "At what the men did for us who are dead,<br> And praise them for the depth of their past lore,<br> And thank them though their life is long past o&#146;er.<br> If they had known that all these things should be<br> How better had they wrought for thee and me?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gravely she looked into his eager eyes,<br> That turned unto the house a little while,<br> But took small heed of all the phantasies<br> Wherewith those men their trouble did beguile,<br> Though calmly did the vast front seem to smile,<br> From all its breadth of beauty looking down<br> Upon the tumult of the joyous town.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again she sighed, but passed on silently,<br> And o&#146;er the golden gangway went the twain<br> Unto the gold shade of the doorway high,<br> Treading on golden cloths, betwixt a lane<br> Of girls who each had been a kingdom's bane<br> In toiling, troubled lands, where loveliness<br> In scanty measure longing men doth bless.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One moment, and the threshold Bharam passed,<br> And that desire his heart was set upon <A NAME="page_255"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 255</FONT></A><br> Yet would not name, his heart hath won at last.<br> Ah, if the end of all thereby were won!<br> For though, indeed, the noon-tide sun hath shone,<br> And all the clouds are scattered, who can say<br> What clouds shall curse the latter end of day?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>THE days passed&#151;growing sweeter as the year<br> Declined through autumn into winter-tide;<br> Perchance, for though no day could be so dear<br> As that whereon he first had seen his bride,<br> Yet still no less did love with him abide,<br> Tempered with quiet days and restfulness;<br> Desire fulfilled, renewed, his life did bless.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thereto now were added other joys,<br> Her gifts indeed, unmeet for him to scorn:<br> The judgment-seat, the tourney's glorious noise,<br> The council wherein were the wise laws born;<br> Sweet tales of lovers vanquished and forlorn,<br> To make bliss greater when these lovers met,<br> Silent, alone, all troubles to forget&#151;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All troubles to forget&#151;the winter went,<br> Spring came, and love seemed worthier therewith weighed, <A NAME="page_256"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 256</FONT></A><br> The summer came, and brought no discontent,<br> Nor yet with autumn's fading did love fade,<br> And the cold winter love the warmer made.<br> &#151;So Bharam said, when round his love he clung,<br> And lonely, still such words were on his tongue.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last from this and that (it boots not now<br> To tell the why and wherefore of the thing),<br> Great war and strife with other lands did grow,<br> And weeping she around his neck must cling,<br> Bidding him look for such a welcoming<br> When he came back again, as should outdo<br> The day that made one heart and life of two.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor did this fail: tried at all points was he,<br> He met the foe, and, beaten back with shame,<br> Snatched from victorious hands the victory,<br> And, winner of a great and godlike name,<br> Sighing with love, back to his love he came,<br> Worthy of love and changed by love indeed,<br> And with most glorious love to be his meed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#151;Ah, changed by love&#151;the fickle careless earth,<br> The deeds of men, the troubles that they had,<br> That in first love he held of little worth,<br> Now like a well-told tale would make him glad,<br> And nought therein to him seemed lost or bad;<br> "And love," he said, "my joyous life doth bound,<br> E&#146;en as the sea some fair isle flows around." <A NAME="page_257"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 257</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#151;"Love flows around"&#151;alas, as time went on<br> Some strong career of striving would he stay,<br> And falter e&#146;en at point of victory won,<br> And well-nigh cast the longed-for thing away:<br> "Nay, let me think of love," then would he say,<br> "Ah, I have swerved from singleness of heart,<br> Let me return, nor in these things have part."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me return"&#151;but, ah, what thing was this?<br> That in his love's arms he would feel the sting<br> Of vain desire, and ne&#146;er-accomplished bliss.<br> &#151;At whiles, indeed&#151;for he had strength to fling<br> All thought away, and to his love to cling.<br> &#151;At least as yet, and still he seemed to be<br> O' Dowered with the depth of all felicity.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So passed the time, till he two years had been<br> Living that joyous life in that fair land,<br> When on a day there came to him the Queen,<br> And said: "Fair love, all folk bow &#146;neath the hand<br> Of this or that, and I, at the command<br> Of one whose will I dare not disobey,<br> Must leave thee lonely till the hundredth day.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Nay, now, forbear to ask me why I go!<br> Thou know&#146;st all things are thine that I have got,<br> Nathless this one thing never shalt thou know,<br> Unless the love grow cold that once was hot,<br> And thou art grown aweary of thy lot. <A NAME="page_258"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 258</FONT></A><br> Ah, love, forgive me! for thy kiss is sweet,<br> As cool fresh streams to bruised and weary feet.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Yet one more word; the room where thou and<br> Were left alone that day of all sweet days;<br> Enter it not, till that time is passed by<br> I told thee of, and many weary ways<br> My feet have worn, to meet thy loving gaze;<br> For surely as thy foot therein shall tread,<br> Thou unto me, as I to thee, art dead.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And yet, for fear of base and prying folk,<br> Needs must thou bear about that chamber's key.<br> Ah, love, farewell! no hard or troublous yoke<br> Thou hast to bear, nor have I doubt of thee.<br> For all the stream of tears that thou dost see,<br> They are love's offspring only, for my heart<br> Yet more than heretofore in thine has part."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus did she go, and he so left behind,<br> Mourned for her and desired her very sore,<br> Yet, with a pang, he felt that he was blind,<br> Despite of words, that yet there was a store<br> Of some undreamed-of and victorious lore<br> He might not touch&#151;frowning he turned away,<br> And seemed a troubled, gloomy man that day.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet loyally for many days he dwelt<br> Within that house, or from his golden throne <A NAME="page_259"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 259</FONT></A><br> Good justice to the thronging people dealt;<br> But when night came, and he was left alone,<br> Then all that splendour scarcely seemed his own;<br> And when he fell to thinking of his love,<br> He &#146;gan to wish that he his heart might prove.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In agony he strove to cast from him<br> Fresh doubts of what she was, and all his tale<br> Rose up once more, now vague indeed and dim,<br> Yet worse therefore perchance&#151;if he should fail,<br> And in some half-remembered hell go wail<br> His happy lot, the days that might have been!<br> Was she his bane?&#151;his life, his love, his queen.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then would he image forth her body fair,<br> And limb by limb would set before his eyes<br> Her loveliness as he had seen it there;<br> Then cry, &#147;Why think of these vain mysteries<br> When still ahead such happy life there lies?<br> And yet and yet, this that doth so outshine<br> All other beauty, is it wholly mine?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;How can it change, that throne of loveliness?<br> How can it change&#151;but I grow old and die.<br> Perchance some other heart those eyes shall bless,<br> Some other head upon that bosom lie,<br> When all that once I was is long gone by:<br> And now what memory through my mind has passed<br> Of men from some strange heaven of love outcast? <A NAME="page_260"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 260</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who knows but in that chamber I may find<br> The clue unto this tangled, weary maze,<br> And vision clear, whereas I now am blind,<br> And endless love instead of anxious days&#151;<br> A glorious end to all these dark strange ways?<br> Perchance those words she did but say to me,<br> To try my heart&#151;did she not give the key?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So passed the days, and sometimes would he strive<br> To think of nothing but her dear return,<br> And midst of kingly deeds would think to live,<br> But then again full oft his heart would burn<br> The uttermost of all the thing to learn;<br> Love failed him not, but baneful jealousy<br> Had scaled his golden throne and sat thereby.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he began to wander nigh the door,<br> And draw from out its place the golden key,<br> And curse the gift, and wish the days passed o&#146;er,<br> Till in his arms his love once more should be;<br> Yet still he dreaded what his eyes should see<br> In those familiar and beloved eyes,<br> Changed now perchance in some unlooked-for wise.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last a day came, on the morn of it<br> Did he arise from haggard dreamful sleep,<br> And on the throne of justice did he sit,<br> In troublous outward things his soul to steep;<br> Then, armed, upon his war-horse did he leap, <A NAME="page_261"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 261</FONT></A><br> And in the lists right eagerly did play,<br> As one who every care hath cast away.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the evening banquet, and he sat<br> To watch the dancers&#146; gold-adorned feet,<br> And with his great men talked of this and that,<br> Then rose, with gold a minstrel-man to greet,<br> Then listened to his pensive song and sweet<br> With serious eyes, and still in everything<br> He seemed an unrebuked and glorious king.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the dead of night was he alone<br> Once more, once more within his wavering heart<br> Strange thought against confused thought was thrown,<br> Nor knew he how real life from dreams to part,<br> All seemed to him a picture made by art,<br> Except the overwhelming strong desire<br> To know the end, that set his heart afire.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn found him thus; then he arose from bed,<br> He kissed her picture hanging on the wall,<br> The linen things that veiled her goodlihead<br> From all but him, and still, like bitterest gall,<br> A thought rose up within him therewithal,<br> And strangely was his heart confused with fears<br> That checked the rise of tender, loving tears.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gat the golden key into his hand,<br> And once more had a glimmering memory <A NAME="page_262"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 262</FONT></A><br> Of how just so he once before did stand,<br> Ready another golden key to try;<br> Then murmured he, "Gat I not bliss thereby?<br> Unless all this is such a gleam of thought,<br> That to a man's mind sometimes will be brought.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of how he lived before, he knows not where."<br> So saying from the chamber did he pass,<br> And went a long way down a cloister fair,<br> And o&#146;er a little pleasance of green grass,<br> Until anigh the very door he was<br> That hid that mystery from him; there he stayed,<br> And in his hand the golden key he weighed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There stood he, trying hard to think thereof,<br> The better and the worse, how all would be<br> If he should do the deed, but thought would move<br> From this thing unto that confusedly,<br> And neither past nor future could he see,<br> Nay scarce could say of what thing then he thought,<br> Such fever now the fierce desire had wrought.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long he lingered, in the lock he set<br> The golden key, as one constrained thereto,<br> And thrust the door back, and with scared eyes met<br> The lovely chamber that so well he knew,<br> And therein still was all in order due,<br> No deathlike image seared his wondering eyes,<br> No strange sound smote his ears with ill surprise. <A NAME="page_263"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 263</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed, and smiled, as one would say, "Ah, why<br> Have I feared this, wherein was nought to fear,<br> Wrapping familiar things in mystery?"<br> And even therewithal did he draw near<br> I To well-remembered things his soul held dear,<br> Gazing at all those matters one by one,<br> That told of sweet things there in past days done.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There in the grey light were the hangings fair,<br> No figure in them changed now any whit,<br> The marble floor half hid with carpets rare<br> E&#146;en as when first he saw her feet on it,<br> A grey moth's whirring wings indeed did flit<br> Across the fair bed's gleaming canopy,<br> But yet no other change had passed thereby.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by the bed upon the floor there lay<br> Soft raiment of his love, as though that she<br> Had there unclad her, ere she went away.<br> He stopped and touched the fair things tenderly,<br> And love swept over him as some grey sea<br> Sweeps o&#146;er the dry shells of a sandy bank,<br> And with dry lips his own salt tears he drank.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rose within a while, and turned about<br> Unto the door, and said, "Three days it is<br> Before she comes to take away all doubt<br> And wrap my soul again in utter bliss;<br> I will depart, that she may smile at this, <A NAME="page_264"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 264</FONT></A><br> Giving the pity and forgiveness due<br> Unto a heart whose feebleness she knew.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith he turned to go, but even then,<br> Upon a little table nigh his hand,<br> Beheld a cup the work of cunning men<br> For many a long year vanished from the land,<br> And up against it did a tablet stand;<br> Whereon were gleaming letters writ in gold;<br> Then breathlessly these things did he behold;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For never had his eyes beheld them erst,<br> And well he deemed the secret lay therein;<br> Trembling, he said, "This cup may quench my thirst,<br> Fair rest from this strange tablet may I win,<br> And if I sin she will forgive my sin;<br> Nay, rather since her word I disobey<br> In entering here, no heavier this will weigh."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withal he took the tablet, and he read;<br> <i>&#147;O thou who, venturing much, hast gained so much,<br> Drink of this cup, and be remembered<br> When all are gone whose feet the green earth touch:<br> Dull is the labouring world, nor holdeth such<br> As think and yet are happy; then be bold,<br> And things unthought of shall thine eyes behold!</i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<i>Yea, thou must drink, for if thou drinkest not<br> Nor soundest all the depths of this hid thing</i>, <A NAME="page_265"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 265</FONT></A><br> <i>Think&#146;st thou that these my words can be forgot,<br> How close soever thou to love mayst cling,<br> How much soever thou art still a king:<br> Drink then, and take what thou hast fairly won,<br> For make no doubt that thine old life is done.</i>"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took the cup and round about the bowl<br> Beheld strange figures carved, strange letters writ,<br> But mid the hurrying tumult of his soul,<br> He of their meaning then could make no whit,<br> Though afterwards their smallest lines would flit<br> Before his eyes, in times that came to him<br> When many a greater matter had grown dim.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with closed eyes he drank, and once again,<br> While on his quivering lip the sweet draught hung,<br> Did he think dimly of those mourning men<br> And saw them winding the dark trees among,<br> And in his ears their doleful wailing rung;<br> His love and all the glories of his home<br> E&#146;en in that minute shadows had become.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E&#146;en in that minute, though at first indeed<br> In one quick flash of pain unbearable,<br> His love, his queen, made bare of any weed,<br> Seemed standing there, as though some tale to tell<br> From opened lips; and then a dark veil fell<br> O&#146;er all things there, a chill and restless breeze<br> Seemed moaning through innumerable trees. <A NAME="page_266"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 266</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet still he staggered onwards to the door<br> With arms outspread, as one who in dark night<br> Wanders through places he has known before;<br> Wide open were his eyes that had no sight,<br> And with a feverish flush his cheeks were bright,<br> His lips moved, some unspoken words to say,<br> As, sinking down, across the door he lay.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>WHAT strange confused dreams swept through his sleep!<br> What fights he fought, nor knew with whom or why;<br> How piteously for nothing he must weep,<br> For what inane rewards he still must try<br> To pierce the inner earth or scale the sky!<br> What faces long forgot rose up to him!<br> On what a sea of unrest did he swim!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He woke, the wind blew cold upon his face,<br> The sound of swirling waters smote his ear,<br> Through the deep quiet of some lonely place;<br> Shuddering with horror at what might be near,<br> He closed his dazzled eyes again for fear,<br> Ere they had seen aught but the light of day<br> And formless things against it, black and grey.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembling awhile he lay, and scarcely knew<br> Why he was sick with fear, but when at last <A NAME="page_267"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 267</FONT></A><br> His wretched soul unto his body drew,<br> And somewhat he could think about the past,<br> As one might wake to hell, around he cast<br> A haggard glance, and saw before him there<br> A grey cliff rising high into the air</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across a deep swift river, and the door<br> Shut fast against him, did he see therein,<br> Wherethrough with trembling steps he passed before<br> That happy life above all lives to win,<br> And round about him the sharp grass and thin,<br> Covered low mounds that here and there arose,<br> For to his head his forerunners were close.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with changed voice he moaned and to his feet<br> Slowly he gat, and &#146;twixt the tree-boles grey<br> He &#146;gan to go, and tender words and sweet<br> Were in his ears, the promise of a day<br> When he should cast all troublous thoughts away.<br> He stopped, and turned his face unto the trees<br> To hearken to the moaning of the breeze;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it seemed well-nigh articulate;<br> He cried aloud, "Come back, come back to me!"<br> If yet the echo of the fearful gate<br> Had any sound to help his misery;<br> He shut his eyes, lest he perchance might be<br> Caught by some fearful dream within a dream,<br> That he might wake up to his gold bed's gleam. <A NAME="page_268"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 268</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voiceless the wind was, the grey cliff was dumb,<br> His eyes could show him nought but that same place<br> Whereto in days of hope his feet had come;<br> He cast himself adown, and hid his face<br> Within the grass, and heeding no disgrace,<br> Howled beastlike, till his voice grew hoarse and dim.<br> And little life indeed seemed left in him.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in a while he rose and tottered on<br> Adown that path, scarce knowing what had been<br> Or why his woe was such, until he won<br> To where had been of old the pleasance green,<br> Whose beauty, whose decay he erst had seen<br> That now indeed a tangled waste had grown,<br> Whose first estate scarce any man had known.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roofless above it then he saw the house,<br> Whose vanished loveliness his heart had filled<br> With fresh luxurious longings amorous,<br> And thitherward, though thus he scarcely willed,<br> His feet must stray to see the wild bird build<br> Her nest within the chambers, once made bright,<br> To house the delicate givers of delight.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the first rage of his grief being o&#146;er,<br> Madness was past, though pain was greater still,<br> And he remembered well the days of yore,<br> And how his great desire made all things ill,<br> And aye with restlessness his life did fill; <A NAME="page_269"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 269</FONT></A><br> Too hard to bear that he must cast away<br> Honour and wealth, to reach e&#146;en such a day.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in the hall upon that bench of stone,<br> Where erst the mourners used to sit, he sat,<br> Striving to think of all that he had done<br> Before his heart's unnamed desire he gat,<br> Striving to hope that still in this or that<br> He might take pleasure yet before he died,<br> That the hard days a little joy might hide.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moaned to think that he had cast away<br> All hope of quiet life then when his hand<br> Was on the key &#146;neath that high cliff and grey,<br> And looking backward he awhile did stand-<br> Needs must he deem him worse than that sad band<br> Who therein erst their wretched lives outwore,<br> However great the burden that they bore.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they, he said, had somewhat left of rest,<br> Since in that place indeed they could abide,<br> But on his heart the weight of woe so pressed<br> That he his wretched head could never hide,<br> But needs must wander forth until he died&#151;<br> Ah God, more full of horror seemed that place,<br> Than the world's curious eyes upon his face.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For there he seemed to sleep that he might dream<br> The worst of dreams,&#151;he seemed to be awake, <A NAME="page_270"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 270</FONT></A><br> That through them all might pierce no hopeful gleam,<br> That he the fearful chain might never break;<br> And shameful images his eyes must make<br> That shuddering he must call by his love's name,<br> And on his lips must gather words of shame.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midst this, I say, what will was left to him,<br> Still urged him unto men's abodes again,<br> So that he rose, and though his eyes were dim<br> With misery, he crossed the sunburnt plain,<br> And as one walks in sleep, with little pain<br> He pierced the forest through, and came once more<br> Unto the hill that looked the uplands o&#146;er.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fierce was the summer sun of that bright day,<br> When on the upland road he set his feet,<br> And man and beast within the shadow lay<br> And rested, but no rest to him was sweet<br> That he could gain, and when the hot sun beat<br> Upon his head as from the wood he passed,<br> Nought noted he that flame upon him cast.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At end of day he reached the city gate,<br> And now no more he moaned, his eyes were dry;<br> Shut in his body's bonds, his soul would wait,<br> The utmost term of all its misery,<br> Nor hope for any ease, nor pray to die.<br> Some poor abode within that city fair<br> He gat himself and passed the long days there. <A NAME="page_271"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 271</FONT></A><br> But now and then men saw him on the quays,<br> Gazing on busy scenes he heeded nought,<br> Or passing through the crowd on festal days,<br> Or in some net of merry children caught,<br> And when they saw his dreamy eyes distraught,<br> His changeless face drawn with that hidden pain,<br> They said, "THE MAN WHO NE'ER SHALL LAUGH AGAIN."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_272"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 272</FONT></A></p>  
<p>AH, these, with life so done with now, might deem<br> That better is it resting in a dream,<br> Yea, e&#146;en a dull dream, than with outstretched hand,<br> And wild eyes, face to face with life to stand,<br> No more the master now of anything,<br> Through striving of all things to be the king&#151;<br> Than waking in a hard taskmaster's grasp<br> Because we strove the unsullied joy to clasp&#151;<br> Than just to find our hearts the world, as we<br> Still thought we were and ever longed to be,<br> To find nought real except ourselves, and find<br> All care for all things scattered to the wind,<br> Scarce in our hearts the very pain alive.<br> Compelled to breathe indeed, compelled to strive,<br> Compelled to fear, yet not allowed to hope&#151;<br> For e&#146;en as men laid on a flowery slope<br> &#146;Twixt inaccessible cliffs and unsailed sea,<br> Painless, and waiting for eternity<br> That will not harm, were these old men now grown.<br> The seed of unrest, that their hearts had sown,<br> Sprung up, and garnered, and consumed, had left<br> Nought that from out their treasure might be reft;<br> All .was a picture in these latter days,<br> That had been once, and they might sit and praise<br> The calm, wise heart that knoweth how to rest, <A NAME="page_273"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 273</FONT></A><br> The man too kind to snatch out at the best,<br> Since he is part of all, each thing a part,<br> Beloved alike of his wide-loving heart.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, how the night-wind raved, and wind and sea<br> Clashed wildly in their useless agony,<br> But dulled not or made weak the minstrel's song<br> That through the hall bemocked the lost year's wrong.</p>
