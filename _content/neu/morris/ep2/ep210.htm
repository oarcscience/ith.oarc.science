<p><FONT SIZE="-1">This story shows how two friends loved a fair woman, and how he who loved her best had her to wife, though she loved him little or not at all; and how one of these two friends gave shame to and received death of the other, who in his turn came to his end by reason of that deed.</FONT></p>  
<p align="center"><i>Of Herdholt and Bathstead</i>.</p>  
<p>HERDHOLT my tale names for the stead, where erst<br> Olaf the Peacock dwelt; nowise the worst<br> Among the great men of a noble day:<br> Upon a knoll amidst a vale it lay,<br> Nigh where Laxriver meets the western sea,<br> And in that day it nourished plenteously<br> Great wealth of sheep and cattle.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye shall know<br> That Olaf to a mighty house did go<br> To take to him a wife: Thorgerd he gat,<br> The daughter of the man, at Burg who sat,<br> After a great life, with eyes waxing dim,<br> Egil, the mighty son of Skallagrim. <A NAME="page_338"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 338</FONT></A><br> Now of the sons the twain had, first we name<br> Kiartan alone, for eld's sake and for fame,<br> Then Steinthor, Haldor, Helgi, and Hauskuld,<br> All of good promise, strong and lithe and bold,<br> Yet little against Kiartan's glory weighed;<br> Besides these props the Peacock's house that stayed,<br> Two maidens, Thurid, Thorbiorg there were;<br> And furthermore a youth was fostered there,<br> Whom Thorleik, Olaf's brother, called his son:<br> Bodli his name was. Thus the tale is done<br> Of those who dwelt at Herdholt in those days.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midst the grey slopes, Bathstead its roof did raise<br> Seven miles from Herdholt; Oswif, wise of men,<br> Who Thordis had to wife, abode there then<br> With his five sons, of whom let names go past<br> That are but names; but these were first and last,<br> Ospak and Thorolf: never, says my tale,<br> That Oswif's wisdom was of much avail<br> In making these, though they were stout enow;<br> But in his house a daughter did there grow<br> To perfect womanhood, Gudrun by name,<br> Whose birth the wondering world no more might blame<br> Than her's who erst called Tyndarus her sire,<br> What hearts soe&#146;er, what roof-trees she might fire,<br> What hearts soe&#146;er, what hearths she might leave cold,<br> Before the ending of the tale be told.<br> But where we take the story up, fifteen<br> The maiden's years were; Kiartan now had seen <A NAME="page_339"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 339</FONT></A><br> His eighteenth spring, and younger by a year<br> Was Bodli, son of Thorleik.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now most fair<br> Seemed Olaf's lot in life, and scarcely worse<br> Was Oswif's, and what shadow of a curse<br> Might hang o&#146;er either house, was thought of now<br> As men think of a cloud the mountain's brow<br> Hides from their eyes an hour before the rain;<br> For so much love there was betwixt the twain,<br> Herdholt and Bathstead, that it well might last<br> Until the folk aforenamed were all passed<br> From out the world; but herein shall be shown<br> How the sky blackened, and the storm swept down.</p>
