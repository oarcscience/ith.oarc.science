<p><FONT SIZE="-1">THIS tale, which is set forth as a dream, tells of a churl's son who won a fair Queen to his love, and afterwards lost her, and yet in the end was not deprived of her.</FONT></p>  
<p><i>IN Norway, in King Magnus&#146; days,<br> A man there dwelt, my story says,<br> Who Gregory had got to name;<br> Folk said from outland parts he came,<br> Though none knew whence; he served withal<br> The Marshal Biorn in field and hall,<br> And little, yet was deft of hand<br> And stout of heart, when men did stand<br> Spear against spear; and his black eyes<br> Folk deemed were somewhat overwise.<br> For of the stars full well he knew,<br> And whither lives of men they drew.<br> So Gregory the Star gazer<br> Men called him, and somewhat in fear<br> They held him, though his daily mood</i> <A NAME="page_35"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 35</FONT></A><br> <i>Was ever mild enow and good.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It chanced upon a summer day,<br> When in the south King Magnus lay,<br> With all his men, the Marshal sent<br> A well-manned cutter, with intent<br> To get him fish for house-keeping,<br> And Gregory, skilful in this thing,<br> The skipper over them to be;<br> So merrily they put to sea,<br> And of a little island lay,<br> Amidst the firth, and fished all day,<br> But when night fell, ashore they went<br> Upon the isle, and pitched their tent,<br> And ate and drank, and slept at last.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while sleep held the others fast<br> Did Gregory waken, turning oft<br> Upon his rough bed nothing soft,<br> Till stealthily at last he rose<br> And crept from the tent thronged and close<br> Into the fresh and cloudless night,<br> And &#146;neath the high-set moon's cold light<br> Went softly down unto the sea;<br> And sleep, that erst had seemed to be<br> A thing his life must hope in vain,<br> Now &#146;gan to fall on him again,<br> E&#146;en as he reached the sandy bay<br> Where on the beach their cutter lay.<br> Calm was the sea &#146;twixt wall and wall<br> Of the green bight; the surf did fall</i> <A NAME="page_36"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 36</FONT></A><br> <i>With little noise upon the sand,<br> Where &#146;neath the moon the smooth curved strand<br> Shone white &#146;twixt dark sea, rocks, and turf</i>.</p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, hearkening to the lazy surf,<br> Musing he scarcely knew of what,<br> Upon a grey rock Gregory sat,<br> Till sleep had all its will of him,<br> And now at last, with slackened limb<br> And nodding head, he fell to dream;<br> And far away now did he seem,<br> Waked up within the great hall, where<br> King Magnus held right merry cheer<br> In honour of the Christmas-tide,<br> At Ladir; and on every side<br> His courtmen and good bonders sat.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There as folk talked of this and that,<br> And drank, and all were blithe enow,<br> Amid the drifting of the snow<br> And howling of the wind without,<br> Within the porch folk heard a shout,<br> And opening of the outer door;<br> Then one came in, who to the floor<br> Cast down the weight of snow, and stood<br> Undoing of his fur-lined hood,<br> And muttering in his beard the while.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King gazed on him with a smile,<br> Then said at last&#151;"What is it then?<br> Art thou called one of my good men</i>, <A NAME="page_37"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 37</FONT></A><br> <i>And art thou of the country-side,<br> Or hast thou mayhap wandered wide?<br> Come sit thee down and eat and drink&#151;<br> &#151;And yet hast thou some news, I think?"</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man said, "News from over sea<br> Of Mary and the Trinity,<br> And goodman Joseph, do I bring;<br> Nowell, Nowell, Nowell, O King!"</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inward he stalked on, therewithal,<br> But stopped amidmost of the hall,<br> And cast to earth his cloak and hood,<br> And there in glittering raiment stood,<br> While the maids went about the board<br> And deftly the cup's river poured,<br> And &#146;mid great clank of ewer and horn<br> Men drank the day when Christ was born</i>.</p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then by the King the gold-clad man<br> Sat, Gregory dreamed, and soon began<br> Great marvels of far lands to tell,<br> And said at last:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ye serve me well,<br> And strange things therefore will I show,<br> Wonders that none save ye may know;<br> That ye this stormy night may call<br> A joyful tide in kingly hall<br> A night to be remembered."</i> <A NAME="page_38"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 38</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Then Gregory dreamed he turned his head<br> Unto the stranger, and their eyes<br> Met therewith, and a great surprise<br> Shot through his heart, because indeed<br> That strange man in the royal weed<br> Seemed as his other self to be<br> As he began this history</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>IN this your land there once did dwell<br> A certain carle who lived full well,<br> And lacked few things to make him glad;<br> And three fair sons this goodman had,<br> Whereof were two stout men enow<br> Betwixt the handles of the plough,<br> Ready to drive the waggons forth,<br> Or pen the sheep up from the north,<br> Or help the corn to garner in,<br> Or from the rain the hay to win;<br> To dyke after the harvesting,<br> And many another needful thing.<br> But slothful was the youngest one,<br> A loiterer in the spring-tide sun,<br> A do-nought by the fire-side<br> From end to end of winter-tide,<br> And wont in summer heats to go <A NAME="page_39"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 39</FONT></A><br> About the garden to and fro,<br> Plucking the flowers from bough and stalk;<br> And muttering oft amid his walk<br> Old rhymes that few men understood.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now is he neither harm nor good,"<br> His father said; "there, let him go<br> And do what he has lust to do."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now so it chanced the goodman had<br> A meadow meet to make him glad<br> Full oft because of its sweet grass,<br> Whereto an ill thing came to pass,<br> When else the days were drawing nigh<br> To hay-harvest, and certainly<br> Our goodman thought all would be won<br> Before the morrow of St. John.<br> For as he walked thereto one day<br> He fell to thinking on the way,<br> "A fair east wind, and cloudless sky<br> In scythes before two days go by."<br> But yet befell a grievous slip<br> Betwixt that fair cup and the lip,<br> For when he reached the wattled fence,<br> And looked across his meadow thence,<br> His broad face drew into a frown,<br> For there he saw all trodden down<br> A full third of the ripening grass,<br> So that no scythe might through it pass; <A NAME="page_40"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 40</FONT></A><br> Then in a rage he turned away<br> And was a moody man that day.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when that eve he sat at home<br> And his two eldest sons had come<br> Back from the field, he spake and said:&#151;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ill-doers, sons, by likelihood<br> Be here about, or envious men;<br> I thought the last had left us, when<br> Skeggi's two sons put off to sea,<br> Yet is there left some enemy<br> Not bold enough on field or way<br> To draw the sword his debt to pay;<br> Therefore, son Thorolf, shalt thou go<br> And bear with thee the great cross-bow,<br> And hide within the white-thorn brake<br> And lie there all this night awake<br> Watching the great south meadow well;<br> Because last night it so befell<br> This gangrel thief thought fit to tread<br> The grass to mammocks by my head!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Thorolf rose unwillingly,<br> And round about his waist did tie<br> The case of bolts, and took adown<br> The mighty cross-bow tough and brown,<br> And in his strong belt set a knife<br> Lest he should come to closer strife, <A NAME="page_41"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 41</FONT></A><br> And thereon, having drunk full well,<br> Went on his way, and thought to tell,<br> A goodly tale at break of day.<br> Thus to the mead he gat, and lay<br> Close hidden in the hawthorn brake,<br> And kept but little time awake,<br> But on the sorrel slept as soft<br> As on his truckle in the loft,<br> Nor woke until the sun was high,<br> When looking thence full sleepily<br> He saw yet more of that fair field,<br> So dealt with, that it scarce would yield<br> Much fodder to his father's neat<br> That summer-tide, of sour or sweet.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then home he turned with hanging head,<br> And right few words that tide he said,<br> In answer to his father's scoff,<br> But toward the middenstead went off.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that same night the vexed carle sent<br> His next son Thord with like intent;<br> But ere the yellow moon was down<br> Asleep and snoring lay our clown,<br> And waking at the dawn could see<br> The meadow trodden grievously.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when unto the house he came,<br> Speaking no word for very shame,<br> The good man &#146;gan to gibe and jeer, <A NAME="page_42"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 42</FONT></A><br> Saying, that many a groat too dear<br> Such sleepy-headed fools he bought,<br> That tide when he their mother sought<br> With Flemish cloth and silver rings<br> And chains, and far-fetched, dear-bought things<br> The mariners had sold to him,<br> For which had many a man to swim<br> Head downward to the porpoises&#151;<br> All to get gluttons like to these!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third son John, who on the floor<br> Was lying kicking at the door,<br> Turned round and yawned, and stretched, and said,<br> "Alas, then, all my rest is sped,<br> For now thou wilt be sending me,<br> O father, the third watch to be.<br> Well, keep thy heart up, I shall know<br> To-morrow, what thing grieves thee so."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea, yea," his father said, "truly<br> A noble son thou art to me!<br> Thou fool, thou thinkest then to win<br> The game when these have failed therein!<br> Truly a mighty mind I have<br> Thy bread and beer henceforth to save,<br> And send thee with some skipper forth,<br> Who brings back stockfish from the north;<br> Then no more dreaming wouldst thou spend<br> Thy days, but learn to know rope's-end, <A NAME="page_43"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 43</FONT></A><br> And stumble on the icy decks<br> To no sweet music of rebecks.<br> &#151;Yet since indeed a fool may do<br> What no wise man may come unto,<br> Go thou, if thou hast any will,<br> Because thou canst not do me ill;<br> And lo, thou! if thou dost me good<br> Then will I fill thy biggest hood<br> With silver pennies for thine own,<br> To squander in the market-town."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought answered John, but turned away,<br> And underneath the trees all day<br> He slept, but with the moon arose;<br> Nor did he arm himself like those,<br> His brethren, for he thought, 'Indeed<br> Of bolt and bow have I no need,<br> For if ill-doers there should be,<br> Then will they slay me certainly,<br> If I should draw on them a bolt;<br> And, though my brethren call me dolt,<br> Yet have I no such foolish thought<br> For a shaft's whistle to be brought<br> To death&#151;withal I shall not see<br> Men-folk belike, but fa&euml;rie,<br> And all the arms within the seas<br> Should help me nought to deal with these;<br> Rather of such lore were I fain<br> As fell to Sigurd Fafnir's-bane <A NAME="page_44"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 44</FONT></A><br> When of the dragon's heart he ate.<br> &#151;Well whatso hap I gain of fate,<br> I know I will not sleep this night,<br> But wake to see a marvellous sight.'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith he came unto the mead,<br> And looked around with utmost heed<br> About the remnant of the hay;<br> Then in the hawthorn brake he lay<br> And watched night-long &#146;midst many a thought<br> Of what might be, and yet saw nought<br> As slowly the short night went by,<br> &#146;Midst bittern's boom and fern-owl's cry;<br> Then the moon sank, the stars grew pale,<br> And the first dawn &#146;gan show the veil<br> The night had drawn from tree to tree,<br> A light wind rose, and suddenly<br> A thrush drew head from under wing,<br> And through the cold dawn &#146;gan to sing,<br> And one by one about him woke<br> The minstrels of the feathered folk,<br> Long ere the first gleam of the sun.<br> Then, though his watch was but begun,<br> E&#146;en at that tide, as well he knew,<br> O&#146;er John a drowsiness there drew,<br> And nothing seemed so good as sleep,<br> And sweet dreams o&#146;er his eyes &#146;gan creep<br> That made him smile, then wake again<br> In terror that his watch was vain; <A NAME="page_45"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 45</FONT></A><br> But in the midst of one of these<br> He started up, for through the trees<br> A mighty rushing sound he heard,<br> As of the wings of many a bird;<br> And, stark awake, with beating heart,<br> He put the hawthorn twigs apart,<br> And yet saw no more wondrous thing<br> Than seven white swans, who on wide wing<br> Went circling round, till one by one<br> They dropped the dewy grass upon.<br> He smiled thereat, and thought to shout<br> And scare them off; but yet a doubt<br> Clung to him, as he gazed on those,<br> And in the brake he held him close,<br> And watched them bridle there, and preen<br> Their snowy feathers well beseen;<br> So near they were, that he a stone<br> Might have cast o&#146;er the furthest one<br> With his left hand, as there he lay.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apace came on the summer day,<br> Though the sun lingered, and more near<br> The swans drew, and began to peer<br> About in strange wise, and John deemed,<br> In after days, he must have dreamed<br> Again, if for the shortest space;<br> For a cloud seemed to dull the place<br> And silence of the birds there was;<br> And when he next looked o&#146;er the grass, <A NAME="page_46"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 46</FONT></A><br> Six swan-skins lay anigh his hand,<br> And nearby on the grass did stand<br> Seven white-skinned damsels, wrought so fair<br> That John must sit and tremble there,<br> And flush blood-red, and cast his eyes<br> Down on the ground in shamefast wise,<br> Then look again with longings sweet<br> Piercing his heart; because their feet<br> Moved through the long grey-seeded grass<br> But some two yards from where he was.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A while in gentle wise they went,<br> Among the ripe long grass that bent<br> Before their beauty; then there ran<br> A thrill through him as they began,<br> In musical sweet speech and low,<br> To talk a tongue he did not know;<br> But when at last one spake alone,<br> It was to him as he had known<br> That heavenly voice for many years,<br> His heart swelled, till through rising tears<br> He saw them now, nor would that voice<br> Suffer his hot heart to rejoice,<br> In all that erst his eyes did bless<br> With unimagined loveliness:<br> Because her face, that yet had been<br> Alone among those girls unseen,<br> He longed for with such strong desire,<br> That his heart sickened, and quick-fire <A NAME="page_47"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 47</FONT></A><br> Within his parched throat seemed to burn.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A while she stood and did not turn,<br> While still the music of her voice<br> Made the birds' song seem tuneless noise;<br> And she alone of all did stand,<br> Holding within her down-drooped hand<br> The swan-skin&#151;like a pink-tinged rose<br> Plucked from amidst a July close,<br> And laid on January snow,<br> Her fingers on the plumes did show:<br> A rosy flame of inner love<br> Seemed glowing through her; she did move<br> Lightly at whiles, or the soft wind<br> Played in her hair no coif did bind.<br> Then did he fear to draw his breath<br> Lest he should find the hand of Death<br> Was showing him vain images;<br> Then did he deem the morning breeze<br> Blew from the flowery fields of heaven,<br> Such fragrance to the morn was given.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now across the long dawn's grey<br> The climbing sun's first level ray,<br> Long hoped, yet sudden when it came,<br> Over the trembling grass did flame<br> And made the world alive once more;<br> And therewithal a pause came o&#146;er<br> The earth and heaven, because she turned, <A NAME="page_48"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 48</FONT></A><br> And with such longing his heart burned<br> That there he thought he needs must die,<br> And, breathless, opened mouth to cry.<br> And yet how soft and kind she seemed;<br> What a sweet helpful smile there gleamed<br> Over the perfect loveliness<br> That now his feeble eyes did bless!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now fell the swan-skin from her hand,<br> And silent all a space did stand,<br> And then again she turned away,<br> And seemed some whispered word to say<br> Unto her fellows; and therewith<br> Their delicate round limbs and lithe<br> Began to sway in measured time<br> Unto a sweet-voiced outland rhyme<br> As they cleft through the morning air<br> Hither and thither: fresh and fair<br> Beyond all words indeed were these,<br> Yet unto him but images<br> Well wrought, fair coloured: while she moved<br> Amid them all, a thing beloved<br> By earth and heaven: could she be<br> Made for his sole felicity?&#151;<br> Yet if she were not, earth and heaven<br> Belike for nought to men were given<br> But to torment his weary heart.<br> He put the thorny twigs apart<br> A little more to gaze his fill; <A NAME="page_49"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 49</FONT></A><br> And as he gazed a thought of ill<br> Shot through him: close unto his hand,<br> Nigher than where she erst did stand,<br> Nigher than where her unkissed feet<br> Had kissed the clover-blossoms sweet,<br> The snowy swan-skin lay cast down.<br> His heart thought, 'She will get her gon<br> E&#146;en as she came, unless I take<br> This snow-white thing for her sweet sake;<br> Then whether death or life shall be,<br> She needs must speak one word to me<br> Before I die.'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therewithal<br> His hand upon the skin did fall<br> Almost without his will, while yet<br> His eyes upon her form were set.<br> He drew it to him, and there lay<br> Until the first dance died away,<br> And from amid the rest thereof<br> Another sprang, whose rhythm did move<br> Light foot, long hair, and supple limb,<br> As the wind moves the poplars slim;<br> Then as the wind dies out again,<br> Like to the end of summer rain<br> Amid their leaves, and quivering now<br> No more their June-clad heads they bow,<br> So sank the rippling song and sweet,<br> And gently upon level feet<br> They swayed, and circle-wise did stand <A NAME="page_50"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 50</FONT></A><br> Each scarcely touching each with hand,<br> Until at last all motion ceased.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still as the dewy shade decreased,<br> Panting John lay, and did not move,<br> Sunk in the wonder of his love,<br> Though fear weighed on him; for he knew<br> That short his time of pleasance grew<br> Though none had told him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the one<br> His heart was set on spake alone,<br> And therewith hand and arm down-dropped,<br> Their scarce-heard murmuring wholly stopped,<br> And softly in long line they passed<br> Unto the thorn-brake, she the last.<br> Then unto agony arose<br> John's fear, as once again all close<br> She was to him. The wind ran by<br> The notched green leaves, the sun was high,<br> Dappling the grass whereon he lay:<br> Fresh, fair, and cheery was the day,<br> And nought like guile or wizardry<br> Could one have thought there was anigh,<br> Till, suddenly, did all things change,<br> E&#146;en as his heart, and dim and strange<br> The old familiar world had grown,<br> That blithe and rough he erst had known,<br> And racked and mined time did seem. <A NAME="page_51"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 51</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sudden, sharp cry pierced his dream,<br> And then his cleared eyes could behold<br> His love, half-hid with hair of gold,<br> Her slim hands covering up her face,<br> Standing amid the grassy place,<br> Shaken with sobs, and round her woe,<br> With long caressing necks of snow<br> And ruffling plumes, the others stood'<br> Bird-like again. Chilled to the blood,<br> Yet close he lay and did not move,<br> Strengthening his heart with thoughts of love,<br> Wild as a morning dream. Withal<br> Some murmured word from her did fall,<br> Closer awhile the swans did press<br> Around her woeful loveliness,<br> As though a loth farewell they bade;<br> And she one fair hand softly laid<br> Upon their heads in wandering wise,<br> Nor drew the other from her eyes,<br> As one by one her body fair<br> They left, and rose into the air<br> With clangorous cries, and circled wide<br> Above her, till the blue did hide<br> Their soaring wings, and all were gone.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As scarce she knew that she was lone,<br> She stood there for a little space,<br> One hand still covering up her face,<br> The other drooped down, half stretched out, <A NAME="page_52"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 52</FONT></A><br> As if her lone heart yet did doubt<br> Somewhat was left her to caress.<br> Yet soon all sound of her distress<br> Was silent, though thought held her fast<br> And nought she moved; the field-mouse passed<br> Close to her feet, the dragon-fly,<br> A thin blue needle flickered by,<br> The bee whirled past her as the morn<br> Grew later, and strange thoughts were born<br> Within her.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she raised her head<br> At last, and, gazing round, she said:<br> "Is pitying love all dead on earth?<br> Is no heart left that holds of worth<br> Love that hands touch not, and that eyes<br> Behold not? Is none left so wise<br> As not to know the smart of bliss<br> That dieth out &#146;twixt kiss and kiss?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stopped and trembled, for she heard<br> The hawthorn brake beside her stirred,<br> Then turned round, half unwittingly,<br> Across the meadow-grass to flee,<br> And knew not whither, as, half blind,<br> She heard the rustling twigs behind,<br> And therewithal a breathless cry<br> And eager footsteps drawing nigh.<br> With streaming hair, a little way<br> She fled across the trodden hay, <A NAME="page_53"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 53</FONT></A><br> Then failed her feet, and turning round,<br> She cowered low upon the ground,<br> With wild eyes turned to meet her fate,<br> E&#146;en as the partridge doth await,<br> With half-dead breast and broken wing,<br> The winged death the hawk doth bring.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dim with the horror of that race,<br> Wild eyes her eyes met, and pale face,<br> And trembling outstretched hands that moved<br> No nigher to her body loved,<br> Whereto they had been brought so near.<br> For very fear of her wild fear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So each of other sore afraid,<br> There fleer and pursuer stayed,<br> Each gathering breath and heart to speak&#151;<br> And he too hopeless, she too weak,<br> For a long space to say a word.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet first her own faint voice she heard,<br> For in his hand she saw the skin,<br> And deemed she knew what he would win,<br> And how that morning's deed had gone:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What have I done? what have I done?<br> Did I work ever harm to thee,<br> That thou this day my bane shouldst be?<br> Why is there such hate in thine eyes<br> Against me?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his breast did rise <A NAME="page_54"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 54</FONT></A><br> A dumb sound, but no word came forth;<br> She shrank aback yet more:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What worth,<br> What worth in all that thou hast done?<br> For say my body thou hast won,<br> Art thou God, then, to keep alive,<br> Unless my will therewith I give?"<br> E&#146;en as she spake, a look of pain<br> Twitched at his face; she spoke again:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  
<p>"For now I see thou hat&#146;st me not,<br> But thinkest thou a prize hast got<br> Thou wilt not lightly cast away:<br> O hearken, hearken!&#151;a poor prey<br> Thy toils shall take, a thing of stone<br> Amid your folk to dwell alone<br> And hide a heart that hateth thee."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shrank back from her wretchedly,<br> And dropped his hand and hung his head;<br> "Nay, now I hate thee not," she said&#151;<br> "And who knows what may come to be<br> If thou but give mine own to me,<br> And free this trembling body here?<br> Wouldst thou rejoice if thou wert dear,<br> Dear unto me though far away,<br> And hope still fed thee day by day?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She deemed he wept now, as he turned <A NAME="page_55"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 55</FONT></A><br> Away from her, and her heart yearned<br> Somewhat toward him as she spake:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And if thou dost this for my sake,<br> Wilt thou, for all that, deem this morn<br> Has made thee utterly forlorn?<br> Hast thou not cast thine arms round Love<br> At least, thy weary heart to move,<br> To make thy wakening strange and new,<br> And dull life false and old tales true;<br> Yea, and a tale to make thy life<br> To speed the others in the strife,<br> To quicken thee with wondrous fire,<br> And make thee fairer with desire?<br> Wilt thou, then, think it all in vain,<br> 'The restless longing and the pain,<br> Lightened by hope that shall not die?<br> For thou shalt hope still certainly,<br> And well mayst deem that thou hast part,<br> Somewhat, at least, in this my heart,<br> Whatever else therein may be."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned about most eagerly<br> And gazed upon her for a while .<br> Wild fear had left her, and a smile<br> Had lit up now her softened face,<br> Sweet pleading kindness gave new grace<br> To all her beauty; fresh again<br> Her cheeks grew, haggard erst with pain <A NAME="page_56"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 56</FONT></A><br> She saw the deep love in his eyes,<br> And slowly therewithal &#146;gan rise,<br> While something in her heart there moved,<br> Some pleasure to be well beloved,<br> Some pain because of doubt and fear,<br> Of once-loved things grown scarce so dear;<br> Less clear all things she seemed to see,<br> Her wisdom in life's mystery<br> Seemed fleeting, and for very shame<br> A tingling flush across her came.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But close unto him did she stand,<br> And, reaching out her little hand,<br> Took his, and in strange searching wise<br> Gazed on him with imploring eyes;<br> And with the sweetness of that touch<br> And look, wrought fear and hope o&#146;ermuch<br> Within him, and his eyes waxed dim,<br> And trembling sore in every limb,<br> He slid adown, and knelt, and said:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O sweetly certes hast thou prayed,<br> Nor used vain words, but smitten me<br> With all the greater agony<br> For all thy sweetness: so, indeed,<br> If thou art holpen well at need<br> By this thy prayer, yet meet it is<br> Ere this one moment of great bliss<br> Has turned to nought all life to come, <A NAME="page_57"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 57</FONT></A><br> That thou shouldst hear me ere my doom,<br> &#151;And yet indeed what prayer to make<br> Thy heart amid its calm to shake,<br> When thou art gone&#151;when thou art gone,<br> And I and woe are left alone!<br> &#151;What fiercest word shall yet avail<br> If this my first and last one fail&#151;<br> Wherewith shall the hard heart be moved<br> If this move not, that it is loved?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eager hand her hand did press,<br> His eyes devoured her loveliness.<br> But silent she a short while stood,<br> Her face now pale, now red as blood,<br> While her lip trembled, and her eyes<br> Grew wet to see his miseries,<br> At last she spake with down-cast head;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas, what shall I do?" she said,<br> "Thy prayer shall make me sorrow more<br> Whenas I go to that far shore<br> I needs must go to; for I know,<br> Poor soul! that thou wilt let me go,<br> Since thou art grown too wise and kind<br> My helpless soul with force to bind&#151;<br> &#151;Would thou might&#146;st have some part in me!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shrank aback afraid, for he<br> Now sprang up with a bitter cry: <A NAME="page_58"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 58</FONT></A><br> "Thou knowest not my agony!<br> Thou knowest not the words thou say&#146;st,<br> Or what a wretched, empty waste<br> This remnant of my life is grown,<br> Or how I need thee all alone<br> To heal the wound this morn has made!<br> &#151;Why tremblest thou?&#151;be not afraid;<br> I will not leave thee any more:<br> Come near to me! My mother bore<br> No dreadful thing when I was born.<br> Fear not, thou art not yet forlorn,<br> As I, as I, as I shall be<br> If ever thou shouldst go from me."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shrank no more, but looked adown<br> And said, "Alas! why dost thou frown?<br> Wilt thou be ever angry thus?"<br> Her voice was weak and piteous<br> As thus she spake, and in her breast<br> A sob there moved, yet hard she pressed<br> The hand she held: too sweet was love<br> For any word his lips to move;<br> Too sweet was hope that lips might dare<br> To touch her sweet cheek smooth and fair.<br> Yet with her downcast eyes she knew<br> That nigher ever his face drew<br> To hers, and new-born love did flame<br> Out from her heart, as now there came <A NAME="page_59"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 59</FONT></A><br> A sound half sigh, half moan from him;<br> She trembled sore, all things &#146;gan swim<br> Before her eyes, nor felt her feet<br> The firm earth&#151;for all over-sweet<br> For sight or hearing life &#146;gan grow,<br> As panting, and with changed eyes now,<br> She raised her parted lips to his.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But ere their fair young mouths might kiss,<br> While hand stole unto hand, and breath<br> Met breath, the image of cold death,<br> With his estranging agonies,<br> Smote on her heart that once was wise;<br> As touched by some sharp sudden sting,<br> Back from her love's arms did she spring,<br> And stood there trembling; and her cry<br> Rang through the morn:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why shouldst thou die<br> Amidst thy just-won joy?" she said,<br> "And must I see thee stark and dead<br> Who have beheld thy gathering bliss?<br> Touch me no more yet&#151;so it is<br> That thy fierce heart hath conquered me,<br> That I no more may look on thee<br> Without desire&#151;for such an end<br> I hitherward, belike, did wend,<br> Led on by fate, and knew it not&#151;<br> But if thy love is e&#146;en as hot<br> As thine eyes say, what wilt thou do? <A NAME="page_60"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 60</FONT></A><br> Loved or loved not, still is it so,<br> That in thy land I may not live.<br> Too strong thou art that I should strive<br> With thee and love&#151;Yet what say&#146;st thou?<br> Art thou content thy love to throw<br> Unto the waste of time, and dwell<br> Here in thy land, and fare right well,<br> Feared, hated maybe, yet through all<br> A conquering man, whate&#146;er shall fall&#151;<br> &#151;Or, in mine own land be mine own,<br> Live long, perchance, yet all unknown,<br> Love for thy master and thy law,<br> Nor hope another lot to draw<br> From out life's urn?&#151;Think of it, then!<br> Be great among the sons of men<br> Because I love thee, and forget<br> That here amid the hay we met&#151;<br> Or else be loved and love, the while<br> Life's vision doth thine eyes beguile."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell upon his knees, and cried:<br> "Ah, wilt thou go?&#151;the world is wide<br> And waste; we were together here<br> A while ago, and I grew dear<br> To thee, I deemed&#151;what hast thou said?<br> Behold, behold, the world is dead,<br> And I must die, or ere I deal<br> With its dead follies more, or feel<br> The dead men's dreams that move men there, <A NAME="page_61"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 61</FONT></A><br> &#151;Alas, how shall I make my prayer<br> To thee, who lovedest me time agone,<br> No more to leave my heart alone?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Musing, his passionate speech she heard,<br> And with a strange look, half afeard,<br> Half pitying, did she gaze on him,<br> Until through tears that sight waxed dim;<br> At last she spake:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need to pray<br> Lest I thy love, O love, betray;<br> But many a thought there is in me<br> If I through love might clearly see;<br> &#151;But the morn wanes fast, dear, arise<br> And let me hence, lest eviler eyes<br> Than thine behold my body here,<br> And thou shouldst buy thy bliss too dear;<br> So bring me to some place anigh<br> Amid thick trees, where thou and I<br> May be alone a little space,<br> To make us ready for the place<br> Where love may still be happiness<br> Unmixed with change and ill distress."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gazed on her, but durst not speak,<br> Nor noted how a sigh did break<br> The sweetness of her speech, but took<br> Her white hand with a hand that shook<br> For very love, and o&#146;er the grass, <A NAME="page_62"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 62</FONT></A><br> Scarce knowing where his feet did pass,<br> He led her, till they came at last<br> Unto a beech-wood, where the mast<br> And dry leaves, made a carpet meet,<br> Sun-speckled, underneath their feet.<br> She stopped him, grown all grave and calm,<br> And laid lips like a healing balm<br> Upon his brow and spake:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, would<br> That I who know of ill and good,<br> And thou who may&#146;st learn e&#146;en as much<br> By misery, might deem this touch<br> Of calm lips, joy enough to last<br> Till life with all its whirl were past&#151;<br> This kiss, and memory of the morn<br> Whereon the sweet desire was born."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He trembled, and beseechingly<br> Gazed on her: "Ah, no, no," said she,<br> "No more with thee this day I strive,<br> E&#146;en as thou prayedst will I give;<br> Belike because I may not choose,<br> Nay nor may let my own soul loose.<br> Is it enow?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more he strove,<br> With some sweet word to bless his love<br> And might not; but she smiled and said:<br> "The lovers of old time are dead,<br> And so too shall it be with thee. <A NAME="page_63"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 63</FONT></A><br> Yea, hast thou heard no history<br> Of lovers who outlived the love<br> That once they deemed the world would move?<br> And so too may it be with thee.<br> &#151;Nay stretch thy right hand out to me,<br> Poor soul, and all shall soon be done."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gold ring with a dark green stone<br> Upon his finger then she set,<br> And said: "Thou may&#146;st repent thee yet<br> The giving of this gift to-day;<br> Be wise then! Cast the ring away,<br> Give me my own and get thee gone;<br> For all the past, not so alone<br> Shall thou and I then be, as erst;<br> Sad, longing, loving, not accurst."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She trembled as she spake, and turned<br> Unto his eyes a face that yearned<br> With great desire, although her eyes<br> Seemed wonderful and overwise.<br> But pain of anger changed his face,<br> He said; "I have compelled thy grace,<br> But not thy love then; do to me<br> E&#146;en as thou willest, and go free."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She murmured; "Nay, what wilt thou have?<br> Thou prayedst and the gift I gave,<br> Giving what I might not withhold, <A NAME="page_64"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 64</FONT></A><br> In spite of wisdom clear and cold.<br> &#151;Alas, poor heart unsatisfied,<br> Why wilt thou love? the world is wide<br> And holdeth many a joyous thing:<br> Why wilt thou for thy misery cling<br> To that desire that resteth not<br> What part soever thou hast got<br> Of that whose whole thou ne&#146;er shalt gain?<br> Alas for thee and me, most vain,<br> Most vain to wrangle more of this!<br> Come then, where wait us woe and bliss,<br> Give me the swan-skin, lay thee down,<br> Nought doubting, on the beech-leaves brown!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What spell weighed on his heart but love<br> I know not, but nought might he move<br> Except to do her whole command;<br> He lay adown, and on his hand<br> Rested his cheek; his eyes grew dim,<br> Yet saw he the white beech-trunks slim<br> At first; and his fair-footed love<br> He saw &#146;twixt sun and shadow move<br> Close unto him, and languidly<br> Her rosy fingers did he see<br> About the ruffled swan-skin white,<br> Even as when that strange delight<br> First maddened him; then dimmer grew<br> His sight, and yet withal he knew<br> That over him she hung, and blessed <A NAME="page_65"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 65</FONT></A><br> His face with her sweet eyes, till rest,<br> As deep as death as soft as sleep,<br> Across his troubled heart did creep;<br> And then a long time seemed gone by<br> And &#146;mid soft herbage did he lie<br> With shut eyes, half awake, and seemed<br> Some dream forgotten to have dreamed,<br> So sweet, he fain would dream again;<br> Then came back memory with a pain,<br> Like death first heard of; with a cry<br> And fear swift born of memory<br> He oped his eyes, that dazed with light<br> Long kept from them, saw nought aright;<br> But something kind, and something fair,<br> Seemed yet to be anigh him there,<br> Whereto he stretched his arms, that met<br> Soft hands, and his own hands were set<br> On a smooth cheek, he seemed to know<br> From days agone;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sweet, sweet doth blow<br> The gentle wind," he said, "whereas<br> Surely o&#146;er blossoms it doth pass<br> If any there be made so sweet."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as he spake, his lips did meet<br> In one unhoped, undreamed-of kiss,<br> The very heart of all his bliss.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like waking from an ecstasy, <A NAME="page_66"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 66</FONT></A><br> Too sweet for truth it seemed to be,<br> Waking to life full satisfied<br> When he arose, and side by side,<br> Cheek touching cheek, hand laid in hand,<br> They stood within a marvellous land,<br> Fruitful, and summer-like, and fair.<br> The light wind sported with her hair,<br> Crowned with a leaf-like crown of gold,<br> Or round her limbs drave lap and fold<br> Of her light raiment strange of hue<br> That earthly shuttle never knew;<br> From overhead the blossoms sweet<br> Fell soft, pink-edged upon her feet,<br> That moved the grass now, as her voice<br> Made the soft scented air rejoice<br> And made him tremble; murmuring;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come,<br> These are the meadows of my home,<br> My home and thine; much have I now<br> To tell thee of, and much to show.<br> Is it with thee, love, as with me<br> That too much of felicity<br> Maketh thee sad? yet sweet it is<br> That little sadness born of bliss<br> And thought of death, and memory<br> That even this perchance goes by."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too glad his eyes now made his heart<br> To let his tongue take any part <A NAME="page_67"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 67</FONT></A><br> In all his joy: afraid he felt,<br> As though but for a while he dwelt<br> Upon the outer ledge of heaven,<br> And scarce he knew how much was given<br> Of all his heart had asked, as she<br> Led softly on from tree to tree.<br> He shut his eyes that he might gain<br> Some image of the world of pain,<br> Some roughness of the world cast by,<br> The more his heart to satisfy,<br> The more to sound the depths of bliss<br> That now belike was ever his.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>BUT therewithal the dream did break,<br> And Gregory sat up, stark awake,<br> And gazing at the surf-line white,<br> Sore yearning for some lost delight,<br> Some pleasure gone, he knew not what;<br> For all that dream was clean forgot.<br> So rising with a smile and sigh,<br> He gat him backward pensively<br> Unto the tent, and past between<br> The sturdy sleepers, all unseen<br> Of sleep-bound eyes, sore troubled yet<br> That he must needs his dream forget.<br> So on his rough bed down he lay</i>, <A NAME="page_68"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 68</FONT></A><br> <i>And thought to wake until the day,<br> But scarce had time to turn him round<br> Ere the lost wonder was well found<br> By sleep; again he dreamed that he<br> Sat at the King's festivity,<br> Again did that sweet tale go on,<br> But now the stranger guest was gone<br> As though he had not been, and he<br> Himself, Star gazing Gregory,<br> Sat by King Magnus, clad in gold,<br> And in such wise the sequel told</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>MIDST all that bliss, and part thereof,<br> Full-fed with choicest gifts of love,<br> The happy lover lived right long<br> Till e&#146;en the names of woe and wrong<br> Had he forgotten.&#151;Of his bliss<br> Nought may we tell, for so it is<br> That verse for battle-song is meet,<br> And sings of sorrow piercing-sweet,<br> And weaves the tale of heavy years<br> And hopeless grief that knows no tears<br> Into a smooth song sweet enow,<br> For fear the winter pass too slow;<br> Yet hath no voice to tell of Heaven<br> Or heavenly joys for long years given, <A NAME="page_69"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 69</FONT></A><br> Themselves an unmatched melody,<br> Where fear is slain of victory<br> And hope, held fast in arms of love,<br> No more the happy heart may move.<br> Sweet souls, grudge not our drearihead,<br> But let the dying mourn their dead<br> With what melodious wail they will!<br> Even as we through good and ill<br> Grudge not your soundless happiness,<br> Through hope whereof alone, we bless<br> Our woe with music and with tears.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now deems the tale that three long years<br> John in that marvellous land abode,<br> Till something like a growing load<br> Of unacknowledged longing came<br> Upon him, mingled with a shame,<br> Which happiness slew not, that he<br> Apart from his own kind must be,<br> Nor share their hopes and fears: withal<br> A gloom upon his face did fall,<br> His love failed not to note, and knew<br> Whither his heart, unwitting, drew.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so it fell that, on a day,<br> As musing by her side he lay,<br> She spake out suddenly, and said:<br> "What burden on thy soul is laid,<br> What veil through which thou canst not see, <A NAME="page_70"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 70</FONT></A><br> Thinkst thou that I hide aught from thee?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He caught her in his arms, and cried,<br> "What is it that from love can hide?<br> Thou knowest this, thou knowest this!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas," she said, "yet so it is<br> That never have I told to thee<br> What danger crept toward thee and me!<br> How could I spoil the lovesome years<br> With telling thee of slow-foot fears,<br> Or shade the sweetness of our home<br> With what perchance might never come?<br> But now we may not turn aside<br> From the sharp thorn the rose did hide."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned on her a troubled face,<br> And said, "What is it, from what place<br> Comes trouble on us?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She flushed red<br> As one who lies, and stammering said;<br> "In thine own land, where while ago<br> Thou dwelledst, doth the danger grow.<br> How thinkst thou? hast thou such a heart,<br> That thou and I a while may part<br> To make joy greater in a while?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled, but something in her smile<br> Was like the heralding of tears, <A NAME="page_71"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 71</FONT></A><br> When lonely pain the grieved heart bears.<br> But he sprang up unto his feet,<br> Glad &#146;gainst his will, and cried; "O sweet,<br> Fear nought at all, for certainly<br> Thy fated fellow still am I;<br> Tell me the tale, and let me go<br> The nighest way to meet the foe."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something there was, that for a while<br> Made her keep silence; with a smile<br> His bright flushed visage did she note,<br> And put her hand unto her throat<br> As though she found it hard to breathe;<br> At last she spake:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The long years seethe<br> With many things, until at last<br> From out their caldron is there cast<br> Somewhat like poison mixed with food;<br> To leave the ill, and take the good<br> Were sweet indeed, but nowise. life,<br> Where all things ever are at strife.<br> Thou, knowing not belike, and I,<br> Wide-eyed indeed and wilfully,<br> Through these three years have ever striven<br> To take the sweet of what was given<br> And cast the bitter half aside;<br> But fate his own time well can bide,<br> And so it fares with us to-day.<br> Bear this too, that I may not say <A NAME="page_72"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 72</FONT></A><br> What danger threatens; thou must go<br> Unto thy land and nothing know<br> Of what shall be&#151;a hard, hard part<br> For such as thee, with patient heart<br> To sit alone, and hope and wait,<br> Nor strive in anywise with fate,<br> Whatever doubt on thee may fall,<br> Unless by certain sign I call<br> On thee to help me: to this end<br> Each day at nightfall shalt thou wend<br> Unto that place, where thou and I<br> First met; there let an hour go by,<br> And if thereby nought hap to thee<br> Of strange, then deem thou certainly<br> All goeth, or too well or ill<br> For thee to help, and bide thou still."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had arisen, side by side<br> They stood now, and all red had died<br> From out his face, most wan he grew,<br> He faltered forth:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would that I knew,<br> If thou hadst ever loved me, sweet!<br> Then surely all things would I meet<br> With good heart."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a trouble came<br> Across his face, that she, for shame<br> Of something hidden, blushed blood-red,<br> Then turned all pale again, and said: <A NAME="page_73"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 73</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou knowest that I love thee well!<br> What shall I do then? can I tell<br> In one short moment all the love<br> That through these years my heart did move?<br> Come nigher, love, and look at me,<br> That thou in these mine eyes mayst see<br> If long enow this troubled dream,<br> That men call life, mine heart may deem<br> To love thee in."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His arms he cast<br> About her and his tears fell fast,<br> Nor was she dry-eyed; slowly there<br> Did their lips part, her fingers fair<br> Sought for his hand:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come, love," she said,<br> "Time wears;" withal the way she led<br> Unto the place where first he woke<br> Betwixt a hawthorn and an oak,<br> And said: "Lie down, and dream a dream,<br> That nought real, wasted then may seem<br> When next we meet! yet hear a word<br> Ere sleep comes: thou mayst well be stirred<br> By idle talk, or longings vain,<br> To wish me in thine arms again;<br> Long then, but let no least word slip<br> Of such a longing past thy lip;<br> For if thou dost, so strangely now<br> Are we twain wedded, I and thou,<br> And that same golden green-stoned ring <A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A><br> Is token of so great a thing<br> That at thy word I needs must come<br> Whereso I be unto thine home;<br> And so were both of us undone:<br> Because the great-eyed glaring sun<br> That lights your world, too mighty is<br> To look upon our secret bliss.<br> &#151;What more to say or e&#146;er thou sleep?<br> I would I yet had time to weep<br> All that I would, then many a day<br> Would pass, or thou shouldst go away.<br> But time wears, and the hand of fate,<br> For all our weeping, will not wait.<br> &#151;Yet speak, before sleep wrap thee round,<br> That I once more may hear the sound<br> Of thy sweet voice, if never more."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all her words she wept right sore.<br> "What wouldest thou?" he said in turn,<br> "Thou know&#146;st for thee and peace I yearn<br> Past words&#151;but now thy lips have sealed,<br> My lips with mysteries unrevealed;<br> How shall I pray, this bitter morn<br> That joy and me atwain hath torn?<br> While yet as in a dream it is<br> Both bliss and this strange end of bliss.<br> Ah what more can I say thereof?<br> That never any end of love<br> I know, though all my bliss hath end; <A NAME="page_75"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 75</FONT></A><br> That where thou willest I will wend,<br> Abide where thou wouldst have me stay,<br> Pass bitter day on bitter day<br> Silent of thee, and make no sign<br> Of all the love and life divine,<br> That is my life and knowledge now."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with that word he lay a-low<br> And by his side she knelt, and took<br> His last kiss with a lovely look,<br> Mingled of utmost love and ruth<br> And knowledge of the hidden truth.<br> And then he heard her sing again<br> Unknown words to a soft low strain,<br> Till dim his senses waxed, nor knew<br> What things were false, and what were true,<br> Mid all the things he saw and heard,<br> But still among strange-plumaged bird,<br> Strange-fruited tree, and strange-clad maid,<br> And horrors making not afraid<br> Of changing man, and dim-eyed beast,<br> &#151;Through all he deemed he knew at least<br> That over him his true-love hung<br> And &#146;twixt her sobs in sweet voice sung<br> That mystic song, until at last<br> Into the dreamless land he passed<br> Of deep, dark sleep without a flaw<br> Where nought he heard and nought he saw. <A NAME="page_76"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 76</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amidst unreasoning huge surprise,<br> Remembering nought, he oped his eyes<br> And leapt up swiftly, and there stood<br> Blinking upon a close beech-wood<br> As one who knew not aught of it;<br> Yet in a while &#146;gan memory flit<br> Across him, and he muttered low<br> Unwitting words said long ago<br> When he was yet a child; then turned<br> To where the autumn noon-sun burned<br> Bright on a cleared space of the wood,<br> Where midst rank grass a spruce-tree stood,<br> Tall, grey-trunked, leafless a long way,<br> And memory of another day,<br> Like to a dream within a dream<br> Therewith across his heart &#146;gan gleam,<br> And gazing up into the tree,<br> He raised his right arm suddenly,<br> E&#146;en as he fain would climb the same;<br> Then, as his vision clearer came,<br> He muttered, 'O Nay, gone is the nest,<br> Nor is it spring-tide; it were best<br> Unto the stead to hurry back,<br> Or else my dinner may I lack,<br> For father's grip is close enow."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therewithal, with head hung low,<br> Even as one who needs not sight,<br> And looking nor to left nor right,<br> Through blind ways of the wood he went, <A NAME="page_77"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 77</FONT></A><br> Seeming as he were right intent<br> On heavy thoughts, as well might be,<br> But scarcely waked yet verily,<br> Or knowing in what place he was.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such wise swiftly did he pass<br> Without a check straight through the wood,<br> Until on the slope-side he stood,<br> Where all its tangles were clean done;<br> There staying, while the unclouded sun<br> Gleamed on the golden braveries<br> That clad him, did he raise his eyes,<br> And &#146;neath his shading hand looked thence,<br> And saw o&#146;er well-tilled close and fence<br> A little knot of roofs between<br> Dark leaves, their ridges bright and green<br> With spiky house-leek; and withal<br> Man unto man did he hear call<br> Afar amid the fields below;<br> And then a hoarse loud horn &#146;gan blow<br> No point of war, but peasant-call<br> To hurry toward the steaming hall.<br> Then as a red spark lights a flame<br> Among light straw, all memory came<br> Back-rushing on his heart, and he<br> &#146;Gan think of joy and misery,<br> Trouble and hope, in tangled wise,<br> Till longing in his heart &#146;gan rise<br> Fretting with troublous ecstasy<br> All else to nought. <A NAME="page_78"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 78</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So pensively<br> Down the hill-side he slipped, and saw<br> All folk unto the homestead draw,<br> And noted how a homeman there<br> Turned round unto the hillside bare<br> Whereas amid the sun he went,<br> Then side-long to his fellow bent<br> And pointed, and all turned about<br> And stood a while, as if in doubt<br> Whether for him they should not stay,<br> Yet went at last upon their way.<br> Now thereat somewhat did he smile<br> And walked the slower for a while,<br> As though with something of a care<br> To meet outside no loiterer,<br> Then went on at a swifter pace:<br> And all things with familiar face<br> Gazed on him; till again the shame<br> Of not being of them o&#146;er him came.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most fair to peaceful heart was all,<br> Windless the ripe fruit down did fall,<br> The shadows of the large grey leaves<br> Lay grey upon the oaten sheaves<br> By the garth-wall as he past by;<br> The startled ousel-cock did cry<br> As from the yew-tree by the gate<br> He flew; the speckled hen did wait<br> With outstretched neck his coming in, <A NAME="page_79"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 79</FONT></A><br> The March-hatched cockerel gaunt and thin<br> Crowed shrilly, while his elder thrust<br> His stiff wing-weathers in the dust<br> That grew aweary of the sun:<br> The old and one-eyed cart-horse dun<br> The middenstead went hobbling round<br> Blowing the light straw from the ground.<br> With curious eyes the drake peered in<br> O&#146;er the barn's dusk, where dust and din<br> Were silent now a little space.</p>  
<p>There for a while with anxious face,<br> Yet smiling therewithal, John stood,<br> Then toward the porch of carven wood<br> He turned, and hearkened to the hum<br> Of mingled speech that thence did come<br> Through the dumb clatter of the hall,<br> Lest any word perchance might fall<br> Upon his ears to tell of aught<br> That change or death thereto had brought,<br> And, listening so, deemed he could hear<br> His father's voice, but nothing clear,<br> And then a pause, and then again<br> The mingled speech of maids and men.<br> Again some word remembered<br> From old days half aloud he said,<br> And pulled his hood about his brow,<br> And went with doubtful steps and slow<br> Unto the door, and took the horn, <A NAME="page_80"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 80</FONT></A><br> His own hand time past did adorn,<br> And blew a loud, clear blast thereon,<br> And pushed the door, then like a sun<br> New come to a dull world he stood,<br> Gleaming with gold from shoes to hood,<br> In the dusk doorway of the place<br> Whence toward him now turned every face.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From &#146;neath his hood he gazed around,<br> And soothly there few gaps he found;<br> Amidmost of the upper board<br> His brethren sat, Thorolf and Thord;<br> He saw his sire, half risen up<br> From the high-seat, a silver cup<br> In his brown hand; and by his side<br> His mother o&#146;er her barm-cloth wide<br> Gazed forward somewhat timidly<br> The new-corner's bright weed to see.<br> Small change in these indeed, John thought,<br> By lapse of days had yet been wrought<br> And for the rest, but one or two<br> There were, he deemed, of faces new.<br> There open-eyed, beer-can in hand,<br> And staring did the damsels stand<br> As he had known them; there he saw<br> Haldor the Icelander half draw<br> His heavy short-sword forth, as he<br> The gleam of gold and steel did see<br> Flash suddenly across the door&#151;<br> An old man skilled in ancient lore, <A NAME="page_81"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 81</FONT></A><br> And John's own foster-sire withal.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on one face did John's eyes fall<br> He needs must note&#151;a woman leaned<br> O&#146;er Thord, and though her face was screened<br> By his wide bush of light red hair<br> Yet might he see that she was fair,<br> And deemed his brother newly wed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, as thoughts ran through his head<br> About the tale that he should tell,<br> His sire, as one who knew right well<br> What manners unto men were meet,<br> Rose up and cried from out his seat:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knight, or fair lord, whatso thou be&#146;st,<br> If thou mayst share a bonder's feast,<br> Sit by me, eat and drink thy fill;<br> For this my hall is open still<br> To peaceful men of all degree."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange seemed his own voice there to be<br> To John, as he in feigned speech said:<br> "Thanks have thou for thy goodlihead<br> And welcome, goodman; certainly<br> Hungry and weary-foot am I,<br> And fain of rest, and strange withal<br> To this your land, for it did fall,<br> That e&#146;en now as I chanced to ride <A NAME="page_82"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 82</FONT></A><br> I lighted by a waterside<br> To slake my thirst; and just as I<br> Was drinking therefrom eagerly,<br> A blue-winged jay, new-hatched in spring,<br> Must needs start forth and fall to sing<br> His villain plain-song o&#146;er my head;<br> And like a ghost come from the dead<br> Was that unto my horse, I trow,<br> Who swerved and went off quick enow,<br> To leave me as a gangrel churl."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou seemest liker to an Earl,"<br> His father said; "but come to meat,<br> To hungry men are bannocks sweet."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So by his father's side he sat<br> And of that homely cheer he ate,<br> Remembered well; and oft he sighed<br> To think how far away and wide<br> The years had set him from all this,<br> And how that all-devouring bliss<br> Had made the simple life of old<br> As a dull tale too often told.<br> But as he sat thereby, full oft<br> The goodwife's eyes waxed sad and soft,<br> Beholding him; she muttered low:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas! fair lips, I ought to know,<br> Like unto lips that once hung here; <A NAME="page_83"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 83</FONT></A><br> Eyes like to eyes that once were dear<br> When all that body I could hold,<br> And flaxen-white was hair of gold."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So muttered she, but said not aught<br> Aloud. Now the fair damsel brought<br> Mead to the gay-clad man, and he<br> Beheld her beauty thoughtfully,<br> As she shook back her cloud of hair,<br> And swung aside her figure fair,<br> And clasped the cup with fingers slim,<br> And poured and reached it forth to him;<br> Then his heart changed again with shame<br> As cold cup and warm fingers came<br> Into his hand, the while his eyes<br> A look in hers must needs surprise<br> That made him flush, and she&#151;the red<br> O&#146;er face and neck and bosom spread<br> And her hand trembled; Thord the while<br> Gazed on her with a foolish smile<br> Across his wide face. So went by<br> The hour of that festivity,<br> And then the boards were set aside;<br> But the host prayed his guest to bide<br> As long as he had will thereto,<br> And therewith to the field did go<br> With sons and homemen, leaving John<br> Among the women-folk alone. <A NAME="page_84"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 84</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these being set to rock and wool,<br> John sat him down upon a stool<br> And &#146;gan to ponder dreamily,<br> &#146;Mid longings, on the days gone by,<br> And many a glance did Thord's wife steal<br> Upon him as she plied the reel<br> Not noted much, though once or twice<br> His pensive eyes did meet her eyes,<br> And troubled and abashed thereat<br> He reddened. But the good wife sat<br> Meanwhile, and ever span and span<br> With steady fingers, and yet wan<br> Her face was grown; her mouth and eyes<br> Seemed troubled with deep memories.<br> At last to Thord's wife did she turn<br> And said:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If honey we would earn<br> Against Yule-tide, the weaving-room<br> Must hear the clatter of the loom;<br> Ere the long web is fully done;<br> So, Thorgerd, thither get thee gone;<br> Thou, Asa, to the cloth-room go<br> And wait me there; and for you two,<br> Mary and Kirstin, best were ye<br> Sitting in Thorgerd's company,<br> To give her help with reel and thread<br> And shuttle."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith, as she said,<br> So did they, and went, one and all; <A NAME="page_85"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 85</FONT></A><br> But in the doorway of the hall<br> Did Thorgerd for a moment stand,<br> Holding her gownskirt in her hand,<br> Her body swaying daintily,<br> Nor cared to hold aback a sigh.<br> Nor son, nor mother noted her,<br> A little time the twain sat there<br> Nor spake, though twice the goodwife strove,<br> But fear forbade her tongue to move;<br> Nor had he noted much forsooth<br> Midst his own longing and self-ruth,<br> Her looks of loving and of doubt.<br> So from the hall did she pass out,<br> And left him there alone, and soon<br> So longing dealt that afternoon<br> That, fallen to musing pensively,<br> In the lone hall, now scarce might he<br> Know if his heart were glad or sad;<br> And tunes within his head he had<br> Of ancient songs learnt long ago,<br> Remembered well through bliss and woe,<br> And now withal a lovesome stave<br> He murmured to a measure grave,<br> Scarce thinking of its sense the while.<br> But as he sat there, with a smile<br> Came handmaid Asa back, who bare<br> Heaped in her arms embroidered gear,<br> Which by his feet did she let fall,<br> Then gat her gone from out the hall; <A NAME="page_86"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 86</FONT></A><br> John, startled, ceased a while his drone<br> To gaze upon the gear cast down,<br> And saw a dark blue cloak and hood<br> Wrought with strange needlework and rude<br> That showed the sun and stars and moon;<br> Then, gazing, John remembered soon<br> How for Yule sport four years agone<br> That selfsame raiment he did on,<br> And thinking on that bygone mirth<br> His own rich cloak he cast to earth,<br> And did on him half wittingly<br> That long-forgotten bravery;<br> And though the sun was warm that day<br> He hugged himself in his old way<br> Within the warmth of fold on fold<br> As though he came from out the cold,<br> And &#146;gan the hall to pace about;<br> And at the last must needs break out<br> Into a song remembered well,<br> That of the Christmas joy did tell.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So sang he, and in pensive wise<br> He sighed, but lifting up his eyes<br> Beheld his mother standing nigh,<br> Looking upon him pitifully.<br> He ran to her, for now he knew <A NAME="page_89"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 89</FONT></A><br> Her yearning love, round her he threw<br> Strong arms, and cried out:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So it is,<br> O mother, that some days of bliss<br> I still may give thee; yet since I<br> To thee at least will never lie<br> Of what I am, and what I hope,<br> And what with ill things I must cope,<br> Sit thou aside, and look not strange<br> When of my glory and great change<br> I shall tell even such a tale<br> As best for all things may avail.<br> And if thou wouldst know verily<br> Meanwhile, how matters fare with me,<br> This thing of all things may I tell;<br> I have been happy and fared well,<br> But now with blind eyes must await<br> Some unseen, half-guessed turn of fate,<br> Before the dropping of the scale<br> Shall make an ending to the tale,<br> Or blithe or sad: think not meanwhile<br> That fear my heart shall now beguile<br> Of all the joy I have in thee."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wept about him tenderly<br> A long while, ere she might say aught;<br> Then she drew back, and some strange thought<br> Stirred in her heart belike, for she<br> Gazed at his splendour timidly, <A NAME="page_90"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 90</FONT></A><br> For the rude cloak to earth was cast,<br> And whispered trembling at the last.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fair art thou come again, sweet son,<br> And sure a long way hast thou gone,<br> I durst not ask thee where: but this<br> I ask thee by the first sweet kiss,<br> Wherewith I kissed thy new-born face<br> Long since within the groaning place&#151;<br> If thou hast been so far, that thou<br> Canst tell to me&#151;grown old, son, now,<br> Through weary life, unsatisfied<br> Desires, and lingering hope untried&#151;<br> If thou canst tell me of thy ruth,<br> What thing there is of lies or truth,<br> In what the new faith saith of those<br> Great glories of the heavenly close,<br> And how that poor folk twinned on earth<br> Shall meet therein in joy and mirth."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling with pity and surprise,<br> He looked into her wistful eyes,<br> And kissed her brow therewith, and said:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nought know I, mother, of the dead,<br> More than thou dost&#151;let be&#151;we live<br> This day at least, great joy to give<br> Each unto other: but the tale<br> Must come from thee about the dale, <A NAME="page_91"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 91</FONT></A><br> And what has happed therein, since I<br> That summer eve went off to try<br> What thing by folly might be wrought<br> When strength and wisdom came to nought."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled amid her tears, and there<br> She told him all he fain would hear,<br> And happily they talked till eve,<br> When the men-folk the field did leave<br> And gat them to the hall, and then<br> Was great rejoicing of all men<br> Within a while, for, cloak and hood<br> Thrown off, in glittering gear John stood<br> And named himself; yet scarcely now<br> His father durst his arms to throw<br> Round his son's neck, remembering<br> How he had thought him such a thing<br> As scarce was meet his bread to win.<br> Small thought had John of that old sin,<br> Yea, scarce had heart to think of aught,<br> But when again he should be brought<br> Face to face with his love; and slow<br> The leaden minutes lingered now;<br> Nor could he fail to hope that he<br> That very hour her face would see;<br> Needs must he hope that his strong love,<br> So sore the heart in her must move,<br> That she no more might bear his pain. <A NAME="page_92"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 92</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That very hour, he thought again&#151;<br> That very hour; woe worth the while,<br> Why should his heart not feel her smile<br> Now, now?&#151;O weary time, O life,<br> Consumed in endless, useless strife,<br> To wash from out the hopeless clay<br> Of heavy day and heavy day<br> Some specks of golden love, to keep<br> Our hearts from madness ere we sleep!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good welcome if of clownish kind<br> Did John from both his brethren find,<br> And from the homemen; Thorgerd seemed<br> As somewhat less of him she deemed<br> Than heretofore, and smiled, as she<br> Put up her fair cheek daintily<br> To take his kiss. So went the night<br> Midst mirth and manifold delight,<br> Till John at last was left alone<br> To think upon the strange day gone,<br> Scarce knowing yet, if nearer drew<br> His bliss because it was gone through.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in such wise, day passed by day,<br> Till heavier on him longing lay,<br> As still less strange it was to wake<br> And no kind kiss of welcome take,<br> And welcome with no loving kiss,<br> Kind eyes to a new day of bliss; <A NAME="page_93"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 93</FONT></A><br> And as the days passed o&#146;er his head<br> Sometimes he needs must wake in dread,<br> That all the welfare, that did seem<br> To be his life, was but a dream,<br> Or all at least slipped swiftly by<br> Into a wretched memory.<br> Yet would hope leave him not, yea, whiles<br> Wrapped round about by her strange guiles<br> All seemed to go right well, and oft<br> Would memory grow so sweet and soft,<br> That scarce the thing it imaged had<br> More might in it to make him glad.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well may ye deem that mid all this<br> His brooding face would cloud the bliss<br> Of many a boisterous night; his sire<br> Would mutter, "He has clomb up higher.<br> But still is moonstruck as before;"<br> His brethren ill his silence bore,<br> Yet feared him; such a tale he told<br> That in that mead he did behold<br> Strange outland people come that morn,<br> 'By whom afar he had been borne<br> Into a fair land, where, he said,<br> Thriving, the king's child did he wed<br> Within a while; "Now, when once more<br> Their keels shall leave their noble shore,<br> At Norway will they touch, and then<br> Back go I with those goodly men, <A NAME="page_94"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 94</FONT></A><br> Now I have seen my land and kin."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair Thorgerd ever sought to win<br> Kind looks of him, and many a day<br> She from the hall would go away<br> To rage within some secret place,<br> That all the sweetness of her face,<br> Her lingering fingers, her soft word,<br> &#146;Twixt red half-opened lips scarce heard,<br> Had bought for her so little ruth;<br> Although there seemed some times, in sooth,<br> When John, grown weary of the strife<br> Within him between dreams and life,<br> Must think it not so over ill<br> To watch her hand the shuttle fill,<br> While on her cheek the red and white<br> Flickered and changed with new delight,<br> And hope of being a thing to move<br> That dreamy man to earthly love.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So autumn fell to winter-tide,<br> And ever there did John abide,<br> &#146;Mid hope deferred and longing fierce,<br> That strove the heavy veil to pierce;<br> And howso strong his love might be,<br> Yet were there tides of misery,<br> When, in his helpless, hopeless rage,<br> He felt himself as in a cage<br> Shown to the gaping world; again <A NAME="page_95"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 95</FONT></A><br> Would heavy languor dull his pain,<br> And make it possible to live,<br> And wait to see if fate would give<br> Some pleasure yet ere all was done.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meantime, with every setting sun,<br> Unto the meadow as she bade<br> He went, and often, half afraid<br> Half hopeful, did he watch the night<br> Suck slowly in the lingering light;<br> But of the homefolk, though all knew<br> Whither his feet at evening drew,<br> Yet now so great a man he was,<br> None asked him why he needs must pass<br> Each eve along the self-same way,<br> Save Thorgerd, who would oft waylay<br> His feet returning, and would watch<br> Some gesture or some word to catch<br> From his unwariness; and whiles<br> Her tender looks and words and smiles<br> Would seem to move him now, and she<br> Laughed to herself delightedly;<br> And as the days grew heavier<br> To John, he oft would gaze on her,<br> At such times as she tripped along,<br> And wonder where would be the wrong<br> If he should tell her of his tale;<br> Withal he deemed her cheek grew pale,<br> As unto Yule-tide drew the days, <A NAME="page_96"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 96</FONT></A><br> And oft into her eyes would gaze<br> In such kind wise, that she awhile<br> Forgot her foolishness and guile<br> Surprised by sparks of inner love.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet nothing a long while did move<br> His mouth to fatal speech, until<br> When the snow lay on moor and hill<br> And it was Yule-day, he did go<br> &#146;Twixt the high drift o&#146;er beaten snow<br> Unto the meadow, as the day<br> Short, wind-bewildered, died away.<br> And so, being come unto the thorn<br> Where first that bitter love was born,<br> He gazed around, but nothing saw<br> But endless waste of grey clouds draw<br> O&#146;er the white waste, while cold and blind<br> The earth looked; e&#146;en the north-west wind<br> Found there no long abiding place,<br> But ever the low clouds did chase<br> Nor let them weep their frozen tears.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange is it how the grieved heart bears<br> Long hours and days and months of woe,<br> As dull and leaden as they go,<br> And makes no sign, yea, and knows not<br> How great a burden it bath got<br> Upon it, till all suddenly<br> Some thought scarce heeded shall flit by, <A NAME="page_97"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 97</FONT></A><br> That tears the veil as by it goes<br> With seeming careless hand, and shows<br> The shrinking soul that deep abyss<br> Of days to come all bare of bliss.<br> And now with John e&#146;en so it fared.<br> He saw his woe and longing bared<br> Before his eyes, as slow and slow<br> The twilight crept across the snow,<br> Like to the dying out of hope;<br> And suddenly he needs must cope<br> With that in-rushing of despair<br> Long held aback, till all things there<br> Seemed grown his foes, his prison-wall;<br> And, whatso good things might befall<br> To others of the wide world, he<br> Was left alone with misery.<br> Why should he hold his peace or strive<br> Amid these men as man to live<br> Who recked not of him? Then he cried:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Would God, would God, that I had died<br> Before the accursed name of Love<br> My miserable heart did move!<br> Why did I leave thee in such wise,<br> False heart, with lovesome, patient eyes,<br> And soul intent to do thy will?<br> And why, why must I love thee still, .<br> And long for thee, and cast on thee<br> Blessings wrung out of misery, <A NAME="page_98"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 98</FONT></A><br> That will not bless thee, if in sooth<br> On my wrecked heart thou hast no ruth?<br> O come, come, come to me, my love,<br> If aught my heart thy heart may move,<br> For I am wretched and alone,<br> With head grown wild, heart turned to stone,<br> Come, if there yet be truth in thee!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gazed about him timorously<br> While thus he spake, as though he thought<br> To see some sudden marvel wrought<br> In earth and heaven; some dreadful death,<br> Some sight, as when God threateneth<br> The world with speedy end; but still<br> Unchanged, o&#146;er mead and wold and hill<br> Drave on the dull low twilight rack,<br> Till all light seemed the sky to lack,<br> And the snow-shrouded earth to gain<br> What it had lost.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In vain, in vain!"<br> He cried, "and I was well bewrayed;<br> She wept o&#146;er me when I was laid<br> Upon the grass beside her feet,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because a pleasure somewhat sweet<br> She needs must lay aside, while I&#151;<br> &#151;What tears shall help my misery?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then back he turned in e&#146;en such mood<br> As when one thing seems no more good <A NAME="page_99"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 99</FONT></A><br> Than is another, and will seems<br> To move the body but by dreams<br> Of ancient life and energy.<br> But as he wandered listlessly<br> Midst the wind's howling, and the drift<br> Of light snow that its force did lift,<br> And gained at last the garth's great gate,<br> He started back, for there did wait<br> A grey form in the dull grey night,<br> Yea, and a woman's; strange affright,<br> Strange hope possessed him, and he strove<br> To cry aloud some word of love,<br> But his voice failed him; she came nigh<br> And drew up to him quietly,<br> Not speaking; when she reached his side<br> Her hand unto his hand did glide<br> And thrilled him with its soft warm touch,<br> He stammered:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Have I loved too much,<br> Have I done wrong? I called thee, dear;<br> Speak, love, and take away my fear!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soft voice answered, "O speak not!<br> I cannot bear my joy, o&#146;er hot<br> Waxeth my heart, when in such wise<br> Thou art changed to me&#151;O thine eyes,<br> I see them through the darksome night<br> Gazing upon me! sweet delight,<br> How shall I deal with all my bliss <A NAME="page_100"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 100</FONT></A><br> So that the world know nought of this,<br> When scarce now I may breathe or stand<br> Holding thy lovesome clinging hand."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now therewith Thorgerd's voice he knew,<br> And from her hand his hand he drew,<br> While o&#146;er his heart there swept again<br> The bitter blast of doubting pain,<br> And scarce he knew who by his side<br> Was going, as aloud he cried:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In vain I call; thou comest not<br> And all our love is quite forgot;<br> What new world hast thou got to rule?<br> What mockeries mak&#146;st thou of the fool<br> Who trusted thee? Alas, alas!<br> Whatever ill may come to pass<br> Still must I love thee."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now by him<br> Went Thorgerd silent, every limb<br> Tingling with madness and desire;<br> Love lit within her such a fire<br> As e&#146;en that eve in nowise cooled,<br> As of her sweet, fresh hope befooled<br> She strove to speak, and found no word<br> To tell wherewith her heart was stirred.<br> So on they went, she knowing nought<br> The bitterness of his ill thought,<br> He heeding not in any wise <A NAME="page_101"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 101</FONT></A><br> The wretchedness of her surprise,<br> Until, thus far estranged, they carne<br> To where the hall's bright light did flame<br> Over a space of trodden snow.<br> Faster a space then did she go,<br> But, as they drew anigh the door,<br> Stopped suddenly, and stood before<br> The musing, downcast man, and laid<br> A hand upon his breast, and said,<br> In a low smothered voice:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wait now,<br> And tell me straightly what didst thou<br> To call me love, and then to cry<br> Thy love came not? I am anigh,<br> What wouldst thou have, did I not move<br> Thy cold heart? am I not thy love?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, trembling as those words she spoke,<br> She cast to earth her heavy cloak;<br> From head to foot clad daintily,<br> Meet for that merry tide was she;<br> A silver girdle clasped around<br> Her well-wrought loins, her fair hair crowned<br> With silver, and her gown enwrought<br> With flowers whereof that tide knows nought;<br> Nor needed she that rich attire<br> To set a young man's heart afire,<br> For she was delicately made<br> As is the lily; there she swayed, <A NAME="page_102"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 102</FONT></A><br> Leaned forward to the strenuous wind<br> That her gay raiment intertwined<br> About her light limbs. Gazing there,<br> Bewildered with a strange despair,<br> John saw her beauty, yet in sooth<br> Something within him slew all ruth<br> If for a moment:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, what love,<br> What love," he cried, "my heart should move,<br> But mine own love, my worshipped sweet?<br> Would God that her beloved feet<br> Would bless our threshold this same night!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, even as a sudden light<br> Shows to some wretch the murderer's knife<br> Drawing anear his outworn life,<br> Knowledge rushed o&#146;er him, and too late<br> Did he bethink him of the fate<br> That threatened, and, grown wild and blind,<br> He turned to meet the western wind<br> That hurried past him, thinking, "Now<br> At least the formless sky will show<br> Some sign of my undoing swift;<br> Surely the sightless rack will lift<br> To show some dreadful misery,<br> Some image of the summer sky<br> Defaced by the red lightning's sword."<br> So spake he, and the fierce wind roared<br> Amid the firs in sullen wise, <A NAME="page_103"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 103</FONT></A><br> But nothing met his fearful eyes<br> Save the grey waste of night. Withal<br> He turned round slowly to the hall,<br> Trembling, yet doubtful of his heart,<br> Doubtful of love. But for her part<br> Thorgerd, half mad with love, had turned<br> And fled from him; a red spot burned<br> Amidst each smooth cheek, and her eyes<br> Afire with furious jealousies,<br> Followed him down the hall, as he<br> Went toward the dais listlessly,<br> And the loud horns blew up to meat,<br> And restless were her fevered feet<br> Throughout the feast that now befell.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now thereat men were served right well,<br> And most were merry, and the horn<br> Full oft from board to beard was borne;<br> But no mead brewed of mortal man<br> Could make John's face less wild and wan;<br> For a long while he trembled sore<br> Whene&#146;er the west-wind shook the door<br> More than its wont; nor heeded he<br> The curse of Thorgerd's misery<br> Wild-gleaming from her eyes; and when<br> She fell to talk with the young men<br> With hapless, haggard merriment,<br> No pang throughout his heart there went:<br> For clear across it were there borne <A NAME="page_104"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 104</FONT></A><br> Pictures of all the life forlorn<br> That should be, yea, his life he saw,<br> Unhelped and heavy-burdened, draw<br> Through the dull joyless years, until<br> The bitter measure they should fill,<br> And he, unloved, unsatisfied,<br> Unkissed, from foolish hope should hide<br> In some dark corner of death's house.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, as the feast grew clamorous<br> About him, and the night went past,<br> The respite wrought on him at last,<br> And from its midst did he begin<br> A little rest from fear to win,<br> And in the feast he joined and seemed<br> No more as in their midst he dreamed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So passed a space, till presently<br> As with a beaker raised on high<br> He stood, and called on some great name<br> Writ in the book of northern fame,<br> Across the wind there came a sound<br> As though afar a horn were wound,<br> A dreadful sound to him; the men<br> Sat hearkening, till it came again<br> Nigher and sharper now, and John,<br> Grown white, laid his left hand upon<br> His beating heart; and then once more<br> Loud rang the horn close by the door, <A NAME="page_105"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 105</FONT></A><br> And men began in haste to take<br> Their weapons for their safety's sake;<br> But John, the cup in his right hand,<br> His left upon his heart, did stand,<br> And might not either move nor speak.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then cried the goodman, "Not so weak<br> Are we, but these may well come in<br> Unmet with weapons; they shall win<br> All good things on this stormy night;<br> Go welcome them to our delight;<br> For on this merry tide of Yule<br> Shall Christ the Lord all matters rule."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then opened they the door, and strong<br> The wild wind swept the hall along,<br> Driving the hangings here and there,<br> Making the torches ruddier,<br> Darkening the fires. But therewithal<br> An utter hush came o&#146;er the hall,<br> And no man spake of bad or good;<br> For in the midst of them there stood<br> A white-clad woman, white as though<br> A piece of fair moonlitten snow<br> Had entered the red smoky hall.<br> Then sweet speech on their ears did fall<br> Thrilling all hearts through:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joy and peace<br> Be on this house, and all increase <A NAME="page_106"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 106</FONT></A><br> Of all good things! and thou, my love,<br> I knew how sore desire must move<br> Thy longing heart, and I am come<br> To look upon thee in thy home:<br> Come to me, give me welcome here!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped adown, and shame and fear<br> Mixed with the joyful agony<br> Of love and longing, as anigh<br> He drew unto her loveliness.<br> A moment, and his arms did press<br> His own love to his heaving breast,<br> And for an instant of sweet rest<br> Midst clinging hands and trembling kiss<br> Did he forget all things but bliss;<br> And still she murmured:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now rejoice<br> That far away I heard thy voice<br> And came! rejoice this night at least,<br> And make good ending to the feast!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith from out his arms she drew,<br> Yet held his hand still; scarce he knew<br> Of where he was, and who were round,<br> And strange and flat his voice did sound<br> Unto himself, as now he spake:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kinsmen, see her, who for my sake<br> Has left her mighty state and home, <A NAME="page_107"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 107</FONT></A><br> Fair beyond words, that she might come<br> With you a little to abide!<br> How say ye, are ye satisfied<br> Her sweet face in your midst to see?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith, though somewhat timidly,<br> Folk shouted; sooth, they deemed her such<br> As mortal man might scarcely touch<br> Or dare to love; with fear fulfilled,<br> With shame of their rough joyance chilled,<br> They sat, scarce moving: but to John<br> Some sweet familiar thing seemed won<br> Despite his fear, as down the hall<br> He led her: if his eyes did fall<br> On Thorgerd's face, how might he heed<br> The anguish of unholpen need,<br> That filled her heart with all despair,<br> As on the twain her eyes did glare?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now softly to the fair high-seat<br> With trembling hand he led his sweet,<br> Who kissed the goodman and goodwife,<br> And wished them fair and happy life,<br> Then like the earth's and heaven's queen,<br> She sat there beauteous and serene,<br> Till, as men gazed upon her there,<br> Joy of her beauty slew their fear;<br> Hot grew their hearts now, as they turned<br> Eyes on her that with strange light burned: <A NAME="page_108"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 108</FONT></A><br> And wild and eager grew the speech<br> Wherewith they praised her each to each,<br> As &#146;neath her eyes they sat.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he<br> Who knew the full felicity<br> Of all they longed for, hushed at whiles,<br> Might answer not her healing smiles<br> With aught but sad imploring eyes,<br> When he bethought him in what wise<br> She there was come&#151;yet none the less<br> Amid bewildered happiness<br> The time went by; until at last<br> Night waned, and slowly all folk passed<br> From out the hall, and the soft sleep<br> O&#146;er all the marvelling house did creep,<br> Bearing to folk that night such dreams,<br> As showed, through wild things, very gleams<br> Of heaven and perfect love, to last<br> Till grey light o&#146;er the world was cast.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, midst the other folk, she too<br> His mazed and doubtful footsteps drew<br> Unto the chamber; when alone<br> They were, and his warm heart seemed one<br> With her and bliss, without a word<br> She gazed on him, and like a sword,<br> Cleaving the very heart atwain<br> That look was, laden with all pain,<br> All love and ruth that she might feel. <A NAME="page_109"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 109</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So through the dark the hours did steal<br> Slow toward the rising of the sun;<br> But long or ere the night was done<br> He slept within her arms, nor heard<br> The sobs wherewith her breast was stirred,<br> Nor felt the tears and kisses sweet<br> That round his set calm face did beat,<br> As round its dead mate beats a bird<br> With useless flutter no more heard:<br> Nor did he move when she unwound<br> The arms that clasped her breast around,<br> And, weeping sore, the gold ring drew<br> From off his hand: and nought he knew<br> When from the bed at last she slid,<br> And, with her body all unhid,<br> Stood gazing on him till a sigh<br> Burst from her heart; and wearily<br> From her sad tear-stained troubled face<br> She swept her hair back:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O the days,<br> Thy weary days, love! Dream not then<br> Of named lands, and abodes of men!<br> Alas, alas, the loneliest<br> Of all such were a land of rest<br> When set against the land where I<br> Unhelped must note the hours go by!<br> Ah, that my hope thy dream might pierce!<br> That mid the dreadful grief and tears,<br> Which presently shall rend thine heart, <A NAME="page_110"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 110</FONT></A><br> This word the cloud might draw apart&#151;<br> My feet, lost Love, shall wander soon<br> <i>East of the Sun, West of the Moon!</i><br> Tell not old tales of love, so strong,<br> That all the world with all its wrong<br> And heedlessness was weak to part<br> The loving heart from loving heart?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith she turned about, and now<br> She wept no more; her cheeks &#146;gan glow,<br> And her eyes glittered, and no more<br> Sorrow her kind mouth brooded o&#146;er,<br> And strange, unearthly beauty shone<br> O&#146;er all her face, whence ruth was gone,<br> Till the dim-litten place was glad<br> That in the midst thereof it had<br> Her loveliness grown dangerous;<br> Softly she gat her through the house<br> Where here and there a dying light<br> Shone on her wondrous limbs and white<br> As through the rough place dreamily<br> She moved: yet was the night wind high<br> And its rude hand, as it did shake<br> Window and door, served but to make<br> The inner stillness yet more still.<br> The clouds were riven; o&#146;er the hill<br> The white moon shone out, yet its light<br> Made the deep night so much more night,<br> That now it seemed as ne&#146;er again <A NAME="page_111"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 111</FONT></A><br> The sun would bless the eyes of men;<br> That all the world had fallen to death.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on she passed, her odorous breath<br> Seen now amidst the moonlit hall,<br> Her unshod foot's light steady fall,<br> The waving of her gust-moved hair,<br> Well-nigh the lonely place might hear<br> Despite the rush and stir without,<br> As, slowly, yet all void of doubt<br> She raised the latchet of the door,<br> And let the wind and moonlight pour<br> Wild clamour and strange light therethrough.<br> She paused not; the wild west wind blew<br> Her hair straight out from her; her feet<br> The bitter, beaten snow did meet<br> And shrank not; slowly forth she passed<br> Nor backward any look she cast,<br> Nor gazed to right or left, but went<br> With eyes on the far sky intent<br> Into the howling, doubtful night,<br> Until at last her body white<br> And its black shadow on the snow,<br> No more the drift-edged way did know.</p>

<p><i>AGAIN the thread snapped; Gregory lay<br> Awake; nor what had passed away<br> Of the short night could tell, till he<br> Through the tent's opening seemed to see<br> A change creep o&#146;er the moonlit sky;<br> So there a short while did he lie<br> Striving to think what he had dreamed,<br> Till utterly awake he seemed;<br> And then, since no more on that night<br> He thought to sleep, and lost delight<br> Of the past dream grown more than dim,<br> With causeless longing wearied him,<br> He rose and left the tent once more,<br> And passed down slowly toward the shore<br> Until the boat he came unto:<br> And there he set himself to do<br> What things were needed to the gear,<br> Until he saw the dawn draw near<br> Across the sea: then, e&#146;en as one<br> Who through a marvellous land hath gone<br> In sleep, and knowing nought thereof<br> To tell, yet knows strange things did move<br> About his sightless journeying,<br> So felt he; and yet seemed to bring,<br> Now and again, some things anigh<br> Unto the wavering boundary<br> &#146;Twixt sight and blindness that awhile<br> Our troubled waking will beguile</i> <A NAME="page_113"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 113</FONT></A><br> <i>When happy dreams have just gone by,<br> And left us without remedy<br> Within the unpitying hands of life</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>THE winter night was on the wane<br> When the poor wretch woke up again;<br> The lone strange sound of cock-crow moved<br> His heart to dream of his beloved<br> &#146;Twixt sleep and waking, and he turned<br> A face with utmost love that yearned<br> And sighed, as his hot hand stole forth<br> To touch a body of more worth<br> To him than Heaven's unmeasured years;<br> Upon his face were undried tears<br> Left by some dream, and yet he smiled<br> To think of deep joy so beguiled<br> By sadness dreamed; his lips began<br> To speak a name unknown to man.<br> A little while in bliss he lay<br> And gathered thoughts of day on day<br> More joyful each than each, until<br> Sweet thankful love his soul did fill<br> With utter ecstasy of bliss,<br> And low he murmured:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kind she is<br> Beyond all kindness ever told!<br> Thou wilt not leave me more, a-cold<br> In the rough world; thou knowest how<br> My weak and clinging heart will grow<br> Unto the strength of thy great heart.<br> O surely no more shall we part, <A NAME="page_115"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 115</FONT></A><br> And never canst thou hurt me more<br> Till all the world and time is o&#146;er!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moonlight waned, on drew the morn,<br> The lessened west wind moaned forlorn<br> In the garth nooks; the eaves dripped now<br> Beneath the thaw, the faint cock-crow<br> Through the dull dawn, and no sound more<br> He heard. Awake, and yearning sore,<br> He turned about and cried:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wake, wake!<br> Day cometh, and my heart doth ache<br> To think how sleep still takes from me<br> Some minutes of felicity,<br> From me and thee, my love, my sweet!<br> O think of Death's forgotten feet,<br> That somewhere surely drawn anigh,<br> And let no minute more pass by<br> With our lips parted each from each!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wildly the ending of his speech<br> Rang from his lips, all strange, as though<br> The thought once thought needs thence must go<br> In words, though all the world were changed.<br> Wildly his opened eyes now ranged<br> The twilight chamber void of her,<br> And through his heart shot such a fear<br> As words may tell not&#151;nay indeed<br> No fear&#151;for now he knew the meed <A NAME="page_116"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 116</FONT></A><br> Of his fool's word, and for a while<br> No hope was left that might beguile<br> His misery and his loneliness,<br> No eager sight, born of distress,<br> Might pierce the cloud that o&#146;er him spread.<br> Such wild thoughts filled his 'wildered head,<br> As once or twice may men endure<br> Yet live; for the earth seemed not sure,<br> Or the air fleeting; fire burned not,<br> Nor water moyed; the snow was hot,<br> The dark hid nought; the coming day<br> No longer sober seemed and grey,<br> But full of flashing light and blue.<br> Yet all things round him well he knew,<br> More real they seemed than e&#146;er before,<br> They would not change, nor would pass o&#146;er<br> One instant of his agony.<br> It was as he had seen time die,<br> And good turn evil &#146;neath his eyes,<br> And God live to forge miseries<br> For him alone, for him alone,<br> For all the world beside seemed gone.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short while, risen in his bed,<br> He hung his wretched brooding head<br> Above the place her limbs had warmed,<br> And shrieked not, though strange curses swarmed<br> About his heart, and wild and fierce<br> Strove hard his dead despair to pierce, <A NAME="page_117"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 117</FONT></A><br> And might not: nought his heart might ease<br> Or for a moment gain him peace.<br> Yet in that time of utter ill,<br> Some reflex of the guiding will<br> That moved his limbs in happier days<br> Still wrought in him; round did he gaze<br> With set eyes, and arose withal;<br> And e&#146;en therewith a thought did fall<br> Upon him that some succour brought,<br> "How can I meet their eyes?" he thought,<br> "How can I bear to hear again<br> The voices of the sons of men?"</p>  
<p>And, nigh unwitting, at that word,<br> Hearkening the while if any stirred,<br> He clad himself and gazed around<br> The place once more, and on the ground<br> There lay her raiment: then he turned<br> His head away, for wild-fire burned<br> Within it, and he strove to speak;<br> But, lest his wretched heart should break<br> And torment end on that first day<br> A new pain did his pain allay,<br> And bitter tears and wailing came<br> To dull the fierceness of the flame<br> That so consumed him; and withal<br> Desire of wandering forth &#146;gan fall<br> Upon him, though he knew not where<br> In all the world to seek for her. <A NAME="page_118"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 118</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, ere his burning tears were spent,<br> Through the unwakened hall he went,<br> And kissed the threshold of the door<br> Her well-loved feet had touched before,<br> Yet saw no signs upon the snow<br> Of those departing feet to show.<br> Cold blew the wind upon his face,<br> As now he left behind the place<br> Where he was born, nor turned again<br> To look farewell; for nought and vain<br> Seemed all things but his misery,<br> That now had grown his life to be,<br> Not to be given away for aught<br> That earth might hold; nor had he thought<br> That anything his lot could change,<br> That anything could more be strange,<br> Lovesome or fearful to his heart,<br> Or in his life have any part.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he went on from that abode,<br> Along a well-known, oft-trod road,<br> He knew not why or where, until<br> Clean hidden by a bare waste hill,<br> Were the snow-covered roofs wherein<br> His outward life did first begin.<br> Then as he wandered on forlorn,<br> From out his unrest was there born<br> Some faint half-memory, that did seem<br> To be the remnant of a dream; <A NAME="page_119"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 119</FONT></A><br> Some image to his mind there clung,<br> Some speech upon his lips yet hung<br> He might not utter.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now he<br> Had gone so long that the wide sea<br> He saw afar, when the dull day<br> Toward eve again had passed away,<br> Amidst the utter solitude<br> Of his time-slaying weary mood.<br> But weak and way-worn was he now,<br> Though greater did his longing grow<br> To wander ever on and on,<br> Until the unknown rest were won.<br> And when he gazed from the hill-side,<br> And saw the great sea spreading wide,<br> All black and empty from the shore,<br> So sharp a longing then came o&#146;er<br> His dull despair, such wild desire,<br> That stung, as when a coal of fire<br> Is laid upon an aching wound,<br> He cast himself upon the ground,<br> And in the cold snow writhed and wailed,<br> While over him the sea-mew sailed,<br> Not silent, and the wind wailed too,<br> As though his bitter grief they knew,<br> And mocked him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet or fell the night<br> He rose, and on the waste of white<br> Stood a black speck, then went until <A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A><br> The black night mingled sea and hill<br> And hurrying rack in nothingness.<br> Yet, kept alive by his distress,<br> He fainted not, nor went astray,<br> For as in dreams he knew the way<br> At last, and whitherward he went,<br> Since round the heart of strong intent<br> His woe was wrapped.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So o&#146;er the down<br> He went, until a haven-town<br> Shone like a patch of stars on earth,<br> And something like a hope had birth<br> Within him, and somewhat he knew<br> His will, now that his body grew<br> Well-nigh too weak to bear him on.<br> Yet to the town at last he won,<br> So heartened now unto the task<br> That he for food and rest might ask;<br> And, since no lack of wealth he had,<br> Soon did he make a goodman glad<br> With gift of gold, and, all outworn,<br> Forgot his grief, and life forlorn<br> In long deep sleep most like to death.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at that town, my story saith,<br> Long must he bide, for so it was<br> That then no good ship well might pass<br> From land to land, for winter-tide<br> Still made the narrow seas full wide. <A NAME="page_121"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 121</FONT></A><br> Each morn did John wake there, to gaze<br> With dead eyes on the waste of days,<br> Each eve he laid him down to sleep,<br> Much marvelling what his life did keep<br> From passing: still the memory<br> Of some faint, dreamlike thing gone by<br> Perplexed his heart, and still he strove,<br> Amid the anguish of his love,<br> To speak that half-remembered word,<br> Amidst a dream, belike, once heard.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This helped him through his dull-eyed woe,<br> That the time passed, and he should go<br> To other lands ere many days,<br> Seeming to seek for that lost face.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last the day desired came<br> When o&#146;er the land the Spring did flame<br> With love and flowers; and on an eve<br> John's good ship did the haven leave,<br> And pale he stood upon the prow,<br> And to the weary place, left now<br> Behind with all its patience dead,<br> No more had will to turn his head,<br> But thinking of the future still,<br> Amid the shipman's tangled skill,<br> Stood looking toward the flaming West,<br> With eyes made strange by love's unrest.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the deck that night he lay, <A NAME="page_122"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 122</FONT></A><br> And nought he slept until the day<br> Began to dawn, and woke again<br> In short space, feeling little pain,<br> And with his pale lips murmuring<br> Some word half-dreamed, some fleeting thing.<br> Then on his arm he rose, and saw<br> The waste of waters seem to draw<br> Unto him as the black prow clave<br> With steady heart green wave on wave;<br> None save the watch were on the deck,<br> Who, sleepy-eyed, no whit did reck<br> Of him and all his woe and love,<br> But &#146;twixt the bulwarks slow did move,<br> With little purpose, as it seemed;<br> The helmsman steered as though he dreamed,<br> Of seafolk's marvels vaguely told<br> By firesides in the days of old;<br> The light wind waxed and waned; the ship<br> Still through the babbling waves did slip<br> As though their talk she hearkened to:<br> And &#146;midst it all John scarcely knew<br> Whether he lived still, or was dead:<br> Well-nigh it came into his head,<br> That he by ghosts of men was borne<br> From out his wasted life forlorn<br> O&#146;er a strange sea to some strange place<br> Of unknown punishment or grace.<br> Skyward he looked, and o&#146;er the mast<br> He saw the moon with all light passed <A NAME="page_123"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 123</FONT></A><br> From out of her, and as he gazed<br> The great sun o&#146;er the green sea blazed,<br> And smote his head with sudden light.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in his heart the flame burned bright<br> That long had smouldered there, he cried;<br> "Ah, woe betide, ah, woe betide,<br> <i>East of the Sun, West of the Moon!</i><br> A land that no man findeth soon,<br> The grave of greedy love that cries<br> To all folk of its agonies:<br> The prison of untrustful love,<br> That thinketh a light word can move<br> The heart of kindness, deep and wise.<br> &#151;O love, love, would thy once-kissed eyes<br> Were glad to-day, that thy sweet smile<br> Forgat a wretch so base and vile,<br> That he but lived to make thee sad,<br> To weep the days that once were glad!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now the dreamlike sight that wrapped<br> His soul all suddenly was snapped.<br> He heard the watch cry out their cry,<br> The helmsman answer cheerily,<br> And mid the homely noise of these<br> Freshened awhile the morning breeze,<br> The ship leaned o&#146;er the highway green,<br> That led to England's meads unseen.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Dunwich, in the east country, <A NAME="page_124"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 124</FONT></A><br> John landed from the weary sea,<br> Not recking where on earth he was;<br> But quickly therefrom did he pass,<br> Driven by growing hope; that word<br> In some old dream belike half heard,<br> <i>East of the Sun, West of the Moon</i>,<br> Seemed unto him a heaven-sent boon,<br> Yet made the merry world around<br> A dreary cage, a narrow round<br> Of dreamlike pain, a hollow place,<br> Filled with a blind and dying race.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That town and country-side, indeed,<br> Seemed all the less to help his need,<br> Whereas for common homely things<br> That well he knew, with Easterlings<br> And his own country-folk they dealt,<br> And scarce knew aught of what folk dwelt<br> Southward beyond the narrow seas;<br> So giving few farewells to these,<br> Towards London did he take his way,<br> And, journeying on, at hostels lay<br> Benights, or whiles at abbeys fair;<br> And as his hope grew, would he dare,<br> In manner of a tale, to tell<br> In what wise woe upon him fell;<br> And most men praised the tale enow,<br> And said no minstrel-wight might show<br> A merrier tale to feasting hall. <A NAME="page_125"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 125</FONT></A><br> And so at last it did befall<br> That at a holy house he lay,<br> A noble house, forsooth, to-day,<br> Men call St. Alban's; there he told<br> Once more, as a thing known of old,<br> The story of his hapless love:<br> Such passion there his tongue did move,<br> That in that Abbey's guest-chamber<br> It was a better thing to hear<br> Than many a history nobly writ,<br> And much were all folk moved by it.<br> But when his speech was fully done,<br> From the board's end there rose up one,<br> A little dry old monk, right wise<br> Of semblance, with small glittering eyes,<br> Who came to John, and said:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thy tale,<br> Fair son, shall much my need avail,<br> For I have many such-like things<br> Writ out for sport of lords and kings;<br> Bide thou with us to-morn, I pray,<br> And hearken some for half a day;<br> For certes shall their memory<br> Help thee to pass the dull days by,<br> When thou growest old."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wide-eyed John stared,<br> For scarce the old man's speech he heard,<br> Or any speech of men, for still<br> One thought his whole sad heart did fill. <A NAME="page_126"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 126</FONT></A><br> Howbeit constrained, he knew not why,<br> He heard full many a history<br> Like to his own next morn, and went<br> Yet more upon his love intent;<br> Yet more the world seemed nought but this,<br> Longing for bliss and losing bliss.<br> And yet, of those fresh tales withal<br> Some endings on his heart did fall<br> As scarcely new; he &#146;gan to make<br> Tales to himself, how for his sake<br> She wept and waited; how some way<br> To Love fulfilled yet open lay;<br> The grey morn often would beguile<br> With dreams his sad lips to a smile,<br> While still his shut eyes did behold<br> Once more her sweetness manifold;<br> And if the waking from delight<br> Unto the real day void and white,<br> Were well-nigh more than man could bear,<br> Yet his own sad voice would he hear<br> Muttering as o&#146;erword to the tune,<br> <i>East of the Sun, West of the Moon</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now come to London at the last,<br> Among the chapmen there he passed,<br> And many a tale of them he had<br> Concerning outlands good and bad<br> That they had journeyed through, but still<br> He heard none speak for good or ill <A NAME="page_127"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 127</FONT></A><br> Of any way unto the place<br> Whereto for him still led all ways.<br> But his hope lived, nor might his heart<br> In any life of man have part,<br> And forth he wandered once again<br> As merchant among chaffering men,<br> And strange he seemed among them all;<br> His face changed not, whate&#146;er might fall<br> Of good or ill; he won, he lost,<br> He gave, as counting not the cost;<br> Fell sick, grew well, and heeded nought<br> What the days took or what they brought;<br> Nowhere he strove great deeds to do,<br> Scarce spoke he save when spoken to;<br> Hither and thither still he went<br> As the winds blow, never content,<br> Never complaining; resting nought,<br> And yet scarce asking what he sought.<br> A strange waif in the tide of life,<br> With nought he seemed to be at strife,<br> To nothing earthly to belong.<br> Still burned his longing bright and strong,<br> As when upon that bitter morn<br> He hung with his white face forlorn,<br> Over the bed yet scarcely cold,<br> That erst her loveliness did hold.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So chasing dreams, so dreamlike chased,<br> Through lapse of years his life did waste; <A NAME="page_128"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 128</FONT></A><br> His body changed, and old he grew<br> Before his time: his face none knew,<br> When, on a time, from journeyings vain<br> In southlands, wandering back again,<br> He heard his father welcome call<br> Across the smoke-wreaths of his hall.<br> O lonely heart! the yearning shame<br> That erst, when back thereto he came,<br> He felt at being so all alone<br> Among his own folk, was clean gone;<br> No lingering kindness of old days<br> Clung now to the familiar place;<br> With unmoved mouth he wandered there,<br> And saw his mother's empty chair,<br> For she was dead: with unchanged eyes<br> Thorgerd he saw from spinning rise,<br> Fair still and young, though he was old.<br> His father's face he did behold<br> With no faint smile of memory,<br> No pang for wasted youth gone by;<br> Betwixt his brethren twain he sat,<br> And heard them talk of this and that<br> Mid stories of a bygone day,<br> Scarce thinking how they used to play<br> Fair children once, and innocent,<br> With the next minute well content.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No goodwill from his kith and kin,<br> And things kind once, he now might win <A NAME="page_129"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 129</FONT></A><br> From out the well-loved wasting fire<br> Of unfulfilled scarce-touched desire.<br> One place was as another place,<br> Haunted by memories of one face,<br> Vocal with one remembered voice,<br> Sad with one time's swift fleeting joys.<br> Yet as he passed the time-worn door<br> The last time, said farewell once more,<br> Scarce mid his outward calm could he<br> Stay quivering lip and trembling knee,<br> That on the threshold longed to lie,<br> Where surely had her feet gone by.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through what wild lands he wandered wide,<br> Among what folk he did abide<br> Thereafter, nought my story saith.<br> Suffice it, that no outbraved death<br> Might end him; no chain of delay<br> His feet from his wild wanderings stay;<br> That every help he strove to gain<br> From wise or fools was still but vain;<br> Until, my story saith, at last<br> The second time in ship he passed<br> The wild waves of the Indian Sea,<br> And with a chaffering company<br> Long time abode, and ever heard<br> And saw great marvels, but no word,<br> No sight of what alone might give<br> A heart unto the dead-alive. <A NAME="page_130"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 130</FONT></A><br> At last from the strange city there<br> He set sail in a dromond fair,<br> With chapmen for his fellows, bound<br> To such a land, that there the ground<br> Bears gems and gold, but nourisheth<br> Little besides save fear and death.<br> So long they sailed, that at the last<br> The skipper's face grew overcast,<br> And the stout chapmen &#146;gan to fear,<br> Because no signs of land drew near,<br> And all the days were fully done<br> When with fair wind they should have won<br> Unto the shore for which they made;<br> But of no death was John afraid<br> While o&#146;er some space as yet untried<br> He bore his love unsatisfied;<br> With hate they eyed his calm face now,<br> For greater still their fear did grow.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anigh the prow one eve he stood,<br> And something new so stirred his blood<br> With hope, that he at last might say,<br> A thing unsaid for many a day,<br> That he was happy; round about<br> The shipmen stood, and gazed in doubt<br> ' Upon a long grey bank of cloud<br> The eastern sky-line that did shroud.<br> He saw it not, grown soft with rest<br> His face was turned unto the west; <A NAME="page_131"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 131</FONT></A><br> The low sun lit his golden hair<br> Changed now with years of toil and care,<br> The light wind stirred it as the prow<br> The babbling ripple soft did throw<br> From its black shining side; the sail<br> Flapped o&#146;erhead as the wind did fail<br> Fitful that eve; the western sky<br> Was bright and clear as night drew nigh<br> Beyond all words to tell; at last<br> He shivered; to the tall white mast<br> He raised his eyes just as the sun<br> Blazed at his lowest: day was done,<br> But yet night lingered, as o&#146;erhead,<br> With a new-kindled hope and dread,<br> The thin-curved moon, all white and cold,<br> &#146;Twixt day and night did he behold.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No need now of that word to think,<br> Or where he heard it; he did shrink<br> Back mid his fellows, for he strove<br> This first time to forget his love<br> Lest hope should slay him; therewith now<br> He heard the shipmen speaking low<br> With anxious puckered brows, and saw<br> The merchants each to other draw<br> As men who feared to be alone;<br> And knew that a fresh fear had grown<br> Beside their old fear, nathless nought<br> To such things might he turn his thought. <A NAME="page_132"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 132</FONT></A><br> All watched that night but he, who slept<br> While lovesome visions o&#146;er him crept,<br> Making night happy with the sight<br> Of kind hands, and soft eyes and bright.<br> At last within a flowery mead<br> He seemed to be, clad in such weed<br> As fellows of the angels wear:<br> Alone a while he wandered there<br> Right glad at heart, until at last<br> By a fair-blossomed brake he passed,<br> And o&#146;er his shoulder gazed as he<br> Went by it; and lo, suddenly,<br> The odorous boughs were thrust apart,<br> And with all heaven within his heart<br> He turned, and saw his love, his sweet,<br> Clad in green raiment to the feet,<br> Her feet upon the blossoms bare,<br> A rose-wreath round her golden hair;<br> Her arms reached out to him, her mouth<br> Trembling to quench his life-long drouth,<br> Yet smiling &#146;neath her deep kind eyes<br> Upon his trembling glad surprise.<br> But when he would have gone to her<br> Him seemed a cry of deadly fear<br> Rang through the fair and lonely close,<br> A cold thick mist betwixt them rose,<br> And then all sight from him did pass,<br> And darkness a long while there was. <A NAME="page_133"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 133</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all at once he woke up, cast<br> With mighty force against the mast,<br> Whereto with desperate hands he clung<br> Unwitting, while the storm-wind sung<br> Its song of death about his ears.<br> But he, though grief had long slain fears,<br> Shouted midst clash of wind and sea,<br> Unheard shrieks, unseen misery<br> Of the black night:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All come to nought!<br> Yestreen I deemed that rest was brought<br> Anigh me, and I thought I knew<br> That toward my Love at last I drew.<br> The loveless rest comes, all deceit<br> Death treads to nothing with his feet!<br> O idle Maker of the world,<br> Art thou content to see me hurled<br> To nought, from longing and from tears,<br> When thou through all these weary years<br> With love my helpless soul hast bound,<br> And fed me in that narrow round<br> With no delight thy fair world knows?<br> Come close, my love, come close, come close,<br> Why wilt thou let me die alone?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howso he deemed his days were done,<br> Yet there still clung he desperately,<br> Mid wash of the in-rushing sea,<br> Mid the storm's night, for no least whit <A NAME="page_134"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 134</FONT></A><br> Might he see through the rage of it,<br> Nor know which unseen hill of wave<br> The rash frail wooden toy would stave,<br> Or if another man did cling<br> Unto the hopeless shivering thing;<br> Yea, or if day had dawned, and light<br> High up serene now mocked the night<br> Of waves and winds. How long he drave<br> From windless trough to wind-sheared wave,<br> No whit he knew, although it seemed<br> So long, that all before was dreamed,<br> That there was neither heaven nor earth<br> Before that turmoil had its birth.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet at last, as on and on<br> He swept, and still death was not won;<br> A pleasure in his heart &#146;gan rise;<br> Love blossomed fresh mid fantasies,<br> Mid dreams born of the overthrow<br> Of sense and sight; he did not know<br> If yet he lived, yet wrong and pain<br> Were words, that hindered not the gain,<br> Of sweet peace, whatso wild unrest<br> Were round about; and all the best<br> Seemed won, nor was one day of bliss<br> Forgotten; all was once more his,<br> That while agone he deemed so lost.<br> How long in sooth the ship was tost<br> From hill to hill of unseen sea <A NAME="page_135"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 135</FONT></A><br> The tale tells not; but suddenly,<br> Amid the sweetest dream of all,<br> A long way down John seemed to fall,<br> Losing all sense of sight and sound;<br> Then brake a sudden light around,<br> Wherethrough he none the less saw nought,<br> And as it waned, waned sense and thought,<br> The peace of dull unconsciousness<br> His wild torn heart at last did bless.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He woke again upon the sand<br> Of a wide bay's curved shell-strewn strand,<br> And long belike had he lain there;<br> For morn it was, and fresh and fair,<br> And no least sign was on the sea<br> Of storm or wrack, but peacefully<br> On the low strand its last wave broke.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce might John dream when thus he woke<br> Of what had happed or where he was;<br> Soft thoughts of bygone days did pass<br> Across his mind at first, and when<br> His later memory came again,<br> It was but with great toil that he<br> Could think about his misery<br> And all his latter wretched years;<br> And if the thought to unused tears<br> Did move him now, yet none the less<br> A strange content and happiness<br> Wrapped him around. <A NAME="page_136"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 136</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to his feet<br> He rose now, and most fresh and sweet<br> The air was round him, and the sun<br> As of the time when morn begun<br> In early summer of the north,<br> Maketh the world seem wondrous worth,<br> And death and pain awhile doth hide.<br> He gazed across the ocean wide<br> With puzzled look; then up and down<br> Sought curiously the sea-sand brown<br> And at the last &#146;gan marvel how<br> No sign the smooth sea-strand might show<br> Of his lost ship and company;<br> Then closer to that summer sea<br> He went, and surely now it seemed<br> That he of India had but dreamed,<br> Because the sand beneath his feet<br> Washed smooth and flat by the sea's beat,<br> Or wrinkled by the ripple low,<br> Such shells and creeping things did show<br> As in the northland well he knew,<br> And round about o&#146;erhead there flew<br> Such sea-fowl as in days of old;<br> Their unknown tales unto him told.<br> He gave a deep sigh, yet his heart<br> From that new bliss would nowise part,<br> Or battle with its strange content;<br> And no more midst his wonderment,<br> Rather for more of pain, he yearned, <A NAME="page_137"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 137</FONT></A><br> Than any rest save one: he turned<br> From the green sea his dreamy eyes,<br> And saw soft slopes and lowly, rise<br> Green and unburnt from the smooth strand,<br> And further in, the rising land,<br> Besprent with trees of no such clime<br> As he had known for weary time;<br> From slope and thicket then there grew<br> High grassy, treeless hillsides, blue<br> With the light haze of that fair tide.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while did he abide<br> Gazing upon that pleasant place,<br> Then o&#146;er his shoulder turned his face<br> Seaward, yet once more &#146;gan to go<br> Unto the hills, and felt as though<br> He bade unto the weltering flood<br> A last farewell; and sweet and good<br> His life seemed grown, e&#146;en when he said,<br> "It may be that my love is dead;<br> Or living, still more like that I<br> Shall see her not before I die;<br> Fool am I then to feel my feet<br> Drawn on some happiness to meet!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So went his words, but e&#146;en as erst<br> When most he felt forlorn and cursed,<br> The words of hope seemed words and air,<br> So now seemed all his words of care <A NAME="page_138"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 138</FONT></A><br> Empty of meaning. Forth he went<br> Light-hearted, till his firm feet bent<br> The daisies of the flowery grass,<br> And swiftly onward did he pass<br> From slope to slope: the land was fair,<br> Yet saw he no house anywhere,<br> No hedge or garden-close or corn;<br> Nor heard he halloo there or horn,<br> To make the dappled deer afraid,<br> That here and there about him strayed<br> Scarce heeding him: no arms he bare,<br> His raiment that had once been fair,<br> Was sorely stained, and worn, and rent,<br> And thirst and hunger as he went<br> Pressed on him; till he came at last<br> To where a spreading fruit-tree cast<br> Its shadows round deliciously;<br> John stayed there, for that friendly tree<br> Had load of apples; so he ate<br> And found them sweet and delicate,<br> As ever monk in garden grew,<br> Though little care belike they knew.<br> But now, when he had had his fill<br> Thereof, there marvelling stood he still,<br> Because to one bough blossoms clung<br> As it were May, but ripe fruit hung<br> Upon the other: then he smiled,<br> As one by a strange dream beguiled,<br> Then slowly on the grass sank down, <A NAME="page_139"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 139</FONT></A><br> For sorely sweet had longing grown<br> With gathering languor of the day.<br> But looking round, as there he lay,<br> Upon the flowers besprent about,<br> Still more was love confused with doubt<br> If still he lived:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Red roses fair<br> To wreathe my love that wanders here,<br> Gold-hearted lilies for her hand!<br> And yet withal that she may stand<br> On something other folk think sweet,<br> March violets for her rosy feet;<br> The black-heart amorous poppy, fain<br> Death from her passing knee to gain,<br> Bows to the gilliflower there:<br> The fiery tulip stands to stare<br> Upon her perfect loveliness,<br> That &#146;gainst the corn-cockle will press<br> Its fainting leaves: further afield<br> The untended vine black fruit doth yield,<br> That bore long torment of the heat,<br> At last in bliss her lips to meet;&#151;<br> The wind-flowers wotting of the thing<br> Must gather round there in the Spring,<br> And live and die and live again,<br> That they might feel the joyous pain<br> At last, of lying crushed and rent<br> Beneath her feet, while well content<br> Above their soft leaves she doth sing. <A NAME="page_140"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 140</FONT></A><br> What marvel, love, that everything<br> That far apart the troubled year,<br> Midst toil and doubt, gives otherwhere,<br> Must gather in this land round thee,<br> Living and dying, still to see<br> A wonder God shall not make twice.<br> Come swiftly, love, because mine eyes<br> Grow dim with love; a little while<br> Shall hope my fainting heart beguile<br> To think me strong; yet well I know<br> That nought of strength is in me now,<br> Save wasting fire of love alone&#151;<br> Come to me then, ere all is gone!<br> And let it not be all for nought<br> That ever one heart have I sought<br> Of all the world, and cast aside<br> All thought that any bliss might hide<br> In aught save in thy love; thy love<br> That even yet perchance might move<br> The Great God not all utterly<br> To slay me, casting my soul by<br> As void henceforth for evermore,<br> What love soever once it bore,<br> That nothing mortal satisfied!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sprang up, o&#146;er the countryside<br> He gazed long, and down ran the tears,<br> At thought of all the pain of years,<br> When he beheld its emptiness; <A NAME="page_141"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 141</FONT></A><br> Yet presently on did he press,<br> With longing grown not all a pain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher slopes now did he gain,<br> Through flowers and blooming trees, until<br> He &#146;gan to breast a steeper hill,<br> And coming out of a close wood,<br> High up above the lowlands stood,<br> And far away beheld the sea<br> Guarding the sweet land patiently,<br> Then turning, clomb on, till the sun<br> Sank low adown and day was done,<br> Before the hill's top he might gain;<br> Then e&#146;en his restlessness was fain<br> There to abide the next day's light.<br> So down he lay, aid the short night<br> Went by in dreams of that past day<br> When in the hawthorn-brake he lay;<br> How many lifetimes now agone<br> That day seemed, when once more alone<br> In the dawn's shiver he awoke!<br> Nathless with sturdy heart he broke<br> Through the morn's hopelessness, and still<br> Pressed up the last steep of the hill,<br> Until together with the sun<br> Its grey and rugged brow he won.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then down into the vale he gazed,<br> And held his breath, as if amazed <A NAME="page_142"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 142</FONT></A><br> By all its wondrous loveliness;<br> For as the sun its depths did bless,<br> It lighted up from side to side,<br> A close-shut valley, nothing wide,<br> But ever full of all things fair.<br> A little way the hill was bare,<br> Then clung to it a deep green wood<br> That guarded many a fertile rood<br> Of terraced vine and slopes of wheat;<br> A white way wound about its feet,<br> Beset with heavy-fruited trees<br> And cleaving orchards through; midst these,<br> Each hemmed round with its flowery close,<br> The cottages and homesteads rose;<br> But the hill-side sprang suddenly<br> From level meadows that did lie<br> On either side a noble stream,<br> O&#146;er which the morning haze did steam,<br> Made golden now; then rose again<br> The further hill-sides, bright with grain,<br> And fair with orchard and close wood,<br> From whence at last the scarped cliffs stood,<br> And clear now, golden in the morn,<br> Against the western sky upborne,<br> Seemed like a guarded wall, lest care<br> Or unrest yet should creep in there.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At John's back now bright the sun shone<br> Once more, once more with all light gone, <A NAME="page_143"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 143</FONT></A><br> Above the further hills hung high,<br> The pale thin moon was in the sky;<br> Then he cried out:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, end the strife<br> Twin lights of God; give death or life!<br> Surely shall I be lying soon<br> <i>East of the Sun, West of the Moon;</i><br> What matter if alive or dead,<br> If so once more our lips are wed!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now he &#146;gan to look around,<br> To see how he the lower ground<br> Might gain, for there the hill had end<br> In shear rocks, so he needs must wend<br> Along its rugged brow; at last,<br> When he a little way had passed,<br> The hill's crest lowered, and &#146;gan draw<br> Back from the vale, and then he saw<br> How it grew wide, and &#146;neath his eyes<br> The river wound now circle-wise,<br> And at the furthest curve thereof<br> There lay, half hid by close and grove,<br> A marvellous house, that jewel-like<br> Gleamed, where the sun its roofs did strike,<br> Or strange-wrought walls; down-gazing now<br> With fluttering heart, he wondered how<br> Its white walls, and its roofs that burned,<br> Should seem e&#146;en like a dream returned<br> From the forgotten land; then down <A NAME="page_144"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 144</FONT></A><br> The hill-side, soft and easy grown,<br> He slipped, and when he reached the way<br> Folk stirred about the morn of day<br> In field and house: fair folk were all<br> He saw, and yet a chill did fall<br> Upon him when he noted them;<br> White linen, well-embroidered hem,<br> Round clean-made limbs he saw, above<br> Were faces sweet, well wrought for love;<br> Yet man and maid, young folk and old,<br> With sad eyes, lonely, strange, and cold,<br> Still seemed to go upon their ways.<br> Moreover, none on him did gaze;<br> And if their eyes met his, as though<br> They saw him not, past did they go;<br> Nor heard he any spoken word<br> Amongst them, nor saw any stirred<br> To laugh or smile by anything.<br> But fearful, yet his hope did cling<br> Unto his heart, nay more, he thought<br> Once more that surely not for nought<br> Among such marvels he was come.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So forth he passed by house and home<br> E&#146;en like a ghost; the open door<br> Of one fair house he stood before,<br> Where folk got ready for their meal,<br> With little sign of woe or weal;<br> And as he stood before their eyes, <A NAME="page_145"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 145</FONT></A><br> They looked his way with no surprise,<br> Nor seemed to see him: nought they spake,<br> Neither durst he the silence break,<br> But went his ways.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tall man stood<br> By the wayside a-hewing wood,<br> And close by was a fair-haired child,<br> Who watched him, but spake not nor smiled,<br> Nor looked up at the wayfarer;<br> John strove to make this goodman hear,<br> Crying out to him cheerily<br> What land of all lands this might be;<br> But nowise did he turn him round,<br> Nor did the youngling heed the sound.<br> Next, as he turned therefrom, there came<br> Along the road an ancient dame,<br> High-perched upon a mule, a lad<br> Of fifteen springs his left hand had<br> Upon the bell-hung bridle-rein&#151;<br> &#151;And still with these were all words vain.<br> So on he went, and no more speech<br> Had heart to try till he did reach<br> The delicate house; and in the square<br> Before it was a conduit fair,<br> Where to and fro the girls did pass,<br> Bearing their jars of earth or brass;<br> Shrill sounded there the grey doves&#146; wings,<br> The steep roof knew their murmurings,<br> The sparrows chirped, the brass did clash, <A NAME="page_146"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 146</FONT></A><br> The water on the stones did plash,<br> The damsels&#146; wind-blown raiment fair<br> And tinkling gold toys sounded there,<br> But not their voices: unto one<br> Who stood and watched the water run<br> Over her jar's lip pensively<br> John turned, for kind she seemed to be:<br> But when with soft beseeching eyes<br> He spake, still in no other wise<br> She dealt with him than had the rest;<br> So when with growing fear oppressed<br> He spake more earnestly, and she<br> Still answered nought, then timidly<br> Upon her hand his hand he laid;<br> Warm was it, but no heed she paid<br> Unto the touch, and he fell back,<br> Wondering what thing those folk did lack<br> That yet they died not: but still burned<br> Hope amid great fear, and he turned<br> Unto the palace door, wherethrough<br> Passed fair-clad people to and fro.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he essayed to enter in<br> None stayed or heeded; he did win<br> Into a fair porch, set around<br> With images of maidens crowned<br> And kings all-armed; through this he gained<br> A pillared court, where waxed and waned<br> A babbling fountain, maidens fair <A NAME="page_147"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 147</FONT></A><br> And slim youths saw he loitering there<br> As lovers loiter; but their eyes,<br> Listless and sad, changed in nowise<br> As past he brushed with hurrying feet<br> And glittering eyes: then did he meet<br> The all-armed clashing guard, and then<br> The long line of the serving-men<br> Bearing up victuals to the hall,<br> And, without bell or trumpet-call,<br> Thither folk streamed. He went with them,<br> And many a wrought cloak and rich hem<br> Brushed past him, many a jewelled sword<br> Clinked at the side of knight or lord,<br> And no word spoken yet&#151;at last<br> Into the mighty hall he passed,<br> And thought no greatest king on earth,<br> E&#146;en were it he of Micklegarth,<br> Or the great lord of Babylon,<br> So fair a place as that had won.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there he stood, till every place<br> Was filled, save midmost of the dais<br> The high-seat lacked a man; so then<br> He laughed loud mid those silent men,<br> Grown reckless in that kingdom cold,<br> And clad in rags mid silk and gold,<br> Barefooted in that dainty hall,<br> He strode up to the ivory stall,<br> And sat him down, and laughed once more <A NAME="page_148"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 148</FONT></A><br> Unheeded, while the servers bore<br> Unto the guests rich meats and drink;<br> Nor from the victuals did he shrink,<br> But well his hunger satisfied<br> Though not long there might he abide,<br> For still his lovesome restlessness<br> Midst all upon his heart did press.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So rising ere the feast was done,<br> He paced the echoing hall alone,<br> And passed the door, and wandered now,<br> Unchecked by any, high and low,<br> And saw strange things and fair; at last<br> A silent maid his side brushed past,<br> And to a carven door did wend,<br> At a long cloister's nether end,<br> Passed in and shut it to again.<br> Then John stood still and strove in vain,<br> With a new hope and gathering fear,<br> And weakly drew the door anear,<br> And laid his hand upon the latch,<br> And with a sob his breath must catch<br> Because of thronging memories.<br> He opened the door now, with eyes<br> Cast down for fear, and therewith heard,<br> As heretofore, no spoken word;<br> But rustling as of women's gear<br> And gentle breathing did he hear<br> And the dull noise upon the ground <A NAME="page_149"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 149</FONT></A><br> Of restless spindles; all around<br> Floated a delicate sweet scent,<br> As though the wind o&#146;er blossoms went.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His breath came fast, his fevered blood<br> Tingled and changed, as there he stood,<br> And each &#146;gainst each now smote his knees;<br> E&#146;en as a world of images<br> The past was grown to him; he knew<br> What in those days he used to do,<br> But knew not what it meant; and yet<br> Would she the past days quite forget,<br> And was she like these dead-alive?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None came, sore trembling did he strive<br> To search the strange place through, but still<br> His hope, fear-tangled, and the ill<br> That might be, bound his eyes full fast<br> A long while&#151;crying out at last<br> E&#146;en ere his eyes had left the ground,<br> As one who some lost thing has found,<br> He stepped forth, and with all surprise<br> Made nought by love, his mortal eyes,<br> His weary eyes, beheld indeed,<br> His heart's desire, his life, his need,<br> Still on the earth, still there for him;<br> And as he gazed, most weak and dim,<br> Seemed all the visions wherewith he<br> Was wont to feed his misery, <A NAME="page_150"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 150</FONT></A><br> To dull the pain unsatisfied,<br> That still for death or presence cried.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the World's Love, the glorious one,<br> My tale says, many maidens spun,<br> Howso John's eyes beheld them not,<br> And she upon her knees had got<br> Some broidery fair, and whiles her hand<br> Moved by her half-dead will's command<br> Would raise it up, and whiles again,<br> As too much all in all grew pain,<br> Would let it fall adown: her face<br> Was altered nothing from the grace<br> That he remembered, save that erst<br> A sad smile even at the worst<br> Would gleam across her pity, but now<br> Betwixt her round chin and smooth brow<br> Lay bound the sorrow of the years,<br> Too sharp for smiles, too hard for tears:<br> Sometimes as some sweet memory<br> Pierced the dull present, wearily<br> She writhed her neck, and raised her head;<br> Sometimes her hands, as feebly led<br> By ghosts of her old longings, moved<br> As though toward some one long time loved,<br> And long time lost; then from her seat<br> Whiles she half rose as if to meet<br> Loved footfalls half-remembered; then<br> The dull pain swallowed all again, <A NAME="page_151"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 151</FONT></A><br> Its child, dull patience, death-in-life,<br> Choked down the rising rest of strife.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarcely his feet might bear him o&#146;er<br> The smoothness of the marble floor<br> Unto her feet; scarce might he raise<br> His wild eyes to her weary face,<br> Scarcely his hand had strength to touch<br> The open hand he loved so much;<br> And yet his thirsting lips love drew<br> Unto dear eyes that nothing knew<br> What closed their lids, to lips still warm,<br> But all forgetful of the harm<br> Their fruitful sweetness erst had wrought,<br> To feet desired, that erewhile brought<br> Love's grief on the sad moaning man,<br> Who fawned on them with lips grown wan,<br> And cheeks grown thin for lack of love.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How might he tell if aught could move<br> Her grief-chilled heart; yet love slew fear,<br> Lulled speech to sleep&#151;sweet to be near;<br> Yea, even if all were changed, if all<br> Into this dumb, strange life must fall,<br> And all the longing and the pain<br> For signs of love were spent in vain;<br> If, in strange wise together brought,<br> They were apart still, and still nought<br> Might tell of better hope! O sweet <A NAME="page_152"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 152</FONT></A><br> Beyond all words, there at her feet<br> To lie and watch her! By what word<br> Might his deep love be better heard<br> Than by that silence.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought he said<br> A long while, and her weary head<br> Hung low, and still she saw him not.<br> At last the heart in him waxed hot,<br> And he cried out:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time long ago,<br> How long, how long, I know not now,<br> I sinned and lost thee: scarce a hope<br> Was left with the dull years to cope;<br> Yet this my hand now touches thee,<br> My cheek is laid upon thy knee;<br> I am thy love, beloved, come,<br> I know not how, to thy new home!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She moved not, but a rush of tears<br> Blinded his eyes, as all the years<br> With all their pain rose up to him;<br> Her head moved then, through foot and limb<br> A tremor ran, as the tears fell.<br> Upon her hands:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Love, scarce well,"<br> He sobbed, "that we should be apart,<br> My sorrow laid upon thy heart,<br> And my heart worn with thine, my love&#151;<br> No word &#146;twixt lips and lips, to move <A NAME="page_153"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 153</FONT></A><br> The double burden&#151;found at last,<br> What chain is it that binds thee fast?<br> Was my great grief so hard to bear<br> That thou art grown cold? Sweet and dear<br> I bore thy grief yet love and live!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He trembled, for she seemed to strive<br> To grasp strange thoughts that flitted round,<br> She clenched her delicate hands, and frowned,<br> And her feet moved uncertainly,<br> The while the maidens sitting by<br> Spun and spun on, nor changed at all.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a strange thought on him did fall,<br> To choke his tears back and tell o&#146;er<br> The story of his longing sore,<br> E&#146;en from that well-remembered day<br> When in the hawthorn-brake he lay.<br> God wot, if his hand trembled oft<br> As he recalled words sweet and soft,<br> And tender touches, all the bliss<br> Of clinging hand and lingering kiss!<br> God wot if he stayed tremblingly<br> As from her breast brake forth a sigh<br> And she fell trembling! And at last,<br> Amid his tale of how she passed<br> Away from him, and left him bare<br> In the rough world of hate and care,<br> Her fingers tightened round his own, <A NAME="page_154"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 154</FONT></A><br> And a sound like a tender moan<br> Parted her lips; he stayed awhile,<br> And on his face a quivering smile<br> Masked the unshed tears, as he told<br> How in that morning drear and cold<br> He found her gone: and therewith she<br> Raised up her head, and eagerly<br> Gazed round, and yet looked not on him:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No hope," he said, "however dim,<br> At first, sweet love, abode with me;<br> I know not how I lived; the sea,<br> The earth, and sky, that day had grown<br> A heavy burden all mine own;<br> As if mine hand all things had wrought<br> To find their strength come all to nought,<br> Their beauty perished, all made vain,<br> Unnoticed parts of the huge pain<br> That filled the world and crushed my heart.<br> Then first, the heavy veil to part,<br> Came memory of thy mouth divine,<br> Some image of a word of thine&#151;<br> &#151;Is it not so that thou saidst this,<br> That morn that parted me and bliss,<br> 'Ah, couldst thou know, I go too soon<br> <i>East of the Sun, West of the Moon?</i>'"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a great sigh, as one who throws<br> A burden off, that sweet arose, <A NAME="page_155"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 155</FONT></A><br> And stood before him, trembling sore<br> With love and joy; ah, me! once more<br> Fulfilled of love their kind eyes met,<br> Although apart they stood as yet,<br> Helpless with pain of ecstasy;<br> Till from her lips a joyful cry,<br> Ringing and sweet, burst forth, and he,<br> Strong no more with love's misery,<br> Faint, changed with this new joyful love,<br> His wandering hands toward her did move<br> E&#146;en but a little way. But round<br> His fluttering heart her arms she wound,<br> And kissed his pale cheeks red again,<br> And hung above his lovesome pain,<br> Desiring him as the spring yearns<br> For the young summer sun, that burns<br> His soft heart into fruitful death.<br> His parched mouth felt her odorous breath,<br> His weary burning head did rest<br> Upon the heaven of her sweet breast,<br> His mazed ears heard her tender speech;<br> His eyes, his silence did beseech<br> For more and more and more of love.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How this their joy fulfilled might move<br> The world around I know not well;<br> But yet this idle dream doth tell<br> That no more silent was the place,<br> That new joy lit up every face, <A NAME="page_156"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 156</FONT></A><br> That joyous lovers kissed and clung,<br> E&#146;en as these twain, that songs were sung<br> From mouth to mouth in rose-bowers,<br> Where, hand in hand and crowned with flowers,<br> Folk praised the Lover and Beloved<br> That such long years, such pain had proved.<br> But soft, they say, their joyance was<br> When midst them soon the twain did pass,<br> Hand locked in hand, heart kissing heart,<br> No more this side of death to part&#151;<br> &#151;No more, no more&#151;Full soft I say<br> Their greetings were that happy day,<br> As though in pensive semblance clad;<br> For fear their faces over-glad<br> This certain thing should seem to hide,<br> That love can ne&#146;er be satisfied.</p>

<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood by as they launched the boat,<br> And little did their labour note.<br> And set no hand thereto at all;<br> Until an awe on these did fall;<br> They muttered, "Ah, the Stargazer<br> Beholdeth strange things drawing near!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So somewhat silently they sailed<br> In up the firth, till the wind failed,<br> Betwixt the high cliffs, and with oars<br> They swept midmost the rocky shores<br> And spake few words.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But smoother now<br> Was grown the worn Stargazer's brow</i>, <A NAME="page_158"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 158</FONT></A><br> <i>And his thin lips were less close-set,<br> For well-nigh now did he forget<br> Fellows and boat and land and sea,<br> And, waking, seemed no less to be</i><br> East of the Sun, West of the Moon,<br> <i>And when they landed at high-noon,<br> From all men would he go apart<br> In woods and meads, and deal by art<br> With his returning memory;<br> And, some things gained, and some slipped by,<br> His weary heart a while to soothe,<br> He wove all into verses smooth,<br> As tells the tale: that wotteth not<br> Hoer much within it&nbsp;it hath got<br> That his hand writ: for soothly he<br> Was deemed a craftsmaster to be<br> In those most noble days of old,<br> Whose words were e&#146;en as kingly gold<br> To our thin brass, or drossy lead:<br> &#151;Well, e&#146;en so all the tale is said<br> How twain grew one and came to bliss&#151;<br> Woe's me an idle dream it is!</i>&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE autumn day, the strange and dreamy tale<br> Were soft as far-off bells adown a vale,<br> Borne to the hill-top on the fitful wind;<br> And like their music past, they left behind<br> Sad thoughts of old desires unsatisfied,<br> And pain and joy that long ago had died,<br> Yea, long been buried &#146;neath the strife of days,<br> Too hard and hapless any woe to raise<br> And crown it with the flowery, fleeting crown<br> Of that strange rest, whose seed is all unknown,<br> That withereth while reproachfully we say;<br> "Why grow&#146;st thou unsought &#146;neath my hand to-day,<br> Whose longed-for scent through many an ill day sought,<br> Swift healing to my sickening soul had brought<br> And kept me young. Fair rest, what dost thou here?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind dealt with the autumn haze, and clear<br> The afternoon was, though the great clouds drew<br> In piled-up hills across the faint-streaked blue,<br> And &#146;gainst them showed the wind-hover's dark spot,<br> Nor yet midst trembling peace was change forgot.</p>
