<p align="center"><i>Kiartan brought dead to Bathstead</i>.</p>  
<p>MEN say that those who went the corpse to bring<br> To Bathstead thence, found Bodli muttering<br> Over the white face turned up to the sky,<br> Nor did he heed them as they drew anigh,<br> Therefore they stood by him, and heard him say:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Perchance it is that thou art far away<br> From us already; caring nought at all<br> For what in after days to us may fall&#151;<br> &#151;O piteous, piteous!&#151;yet perchance it is<br> That thou, though entering on thy life of bliss,<br> The meed of thy great heart, yet art anear,<br> And somewhat of my feeble voice can hear;<br> Then scarce for pardon will I pray thee, friend,<br> Since thus our love is brought unto no end,<br> But rather now, indeed, begins anew;<br> Yet since a long time past nought good or true <A NAME="page_507"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 507</FONT></A><br> My lips might utter, let me speak to thee,<br> If so it really is that thou art free,<br> At peace and happy past the golden gate;<br> That time is dead for thee, and thou mayst wait<br> A thousand years for her and deem it nought.<br> O dead friend, in my heart there springs a thought<br> That, since with thy last breath thou spakst her name,<br> And since thou knowest now how longing came<br> Into my soul, thou wilt forgive me yet<br> That time of times, when in my heart first met<br> Anger against thee, with the sweet&nbsp;sweet love<br> Wherewith my old dull life of habit strove<br> So weakly and so vainly&#151;didst thou quite<br> Know all the value of that dear delight<br> As I did? Kiartan, she is changed to thee;<br> Yea, and since hope is dead changed too to me,<br> What shall we do, if, each of each forgiven,<br> We three shall meet at last in that fair heaven<br> The new faith tells of? Thee and God I pray<br> Impute it not for sin to me to-day,<br> If no thought I can shape thereof but this:<br> O friend, O friend, when thee I meet in bliss,<br> Wilt thou not give my love Gudrun to me,<br> Since now indeed thine eyes made clear can see<br> That I of all the world must love her most?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then his voice sank so that his words were lost<br> A little while; then once again he spake,<br> As one who from a lovesome dream doth wake: <A NAME="page_508"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 508</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas! I speak of heaven who am in hell!<br> I speak of change of days, who know full well<br> How hopeless now is change from misery:<br> I speak of time destroyed, when unto me<br> Shall the world's minutes be as lapse of years;<br> I speak of love who know how my life bears<br> The bitter hate which I must face to-day&#151;<br> I speak of thee, and know thee passed away,<br> Ne&#146;er to come back to help or pity me."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith he looked up, and those folk did see,<br> And rose up to his feet, and with strange eyes<br> That seemed to see nought, slunk in shamefast wise,<br> Silent, behind them, as the corpse they laid<br> Upon the bier; then, all things being arrayed,<br> Back unto Bathstead did they wend once more,<br> As mournful as though dead with them they bore<br> The heart of Iceland; and yet folk must gaze<br> With awe and pity upon Bodli's face,<br> And deem they never might such eyes forget.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when they reached the stead, anigh sunset,<br> There in the porch a tall black figure stood,<br> Whose stern pale face, &#146;neath its o&#146;erhanging hood,<br> In the porch shadow was all cold and grey,<br> Though on her feet the dying sunlight lay.<br> They trembled then at what might come to pass,<br> For that grey face the face of Gudrun was,<br> And they had heard her raving through the day<br> As through the hall they passed; then made they stay <A NAME="page_509"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 509</FONT></A><br> A few yards from the threshold, and in dread<br> Waited what next should follow; but she said,<br> In a low voice and hoarse:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, enter here,<br> Without, this eve is too much change and stir,<br> And rest is good,&#151;is good, if one might win<br> A moment's rest; and now none is within<br> The hall but Oswif: not much will he speak,<br> And as for me&#151;behold, I am grown weak!<br> I cannot vex him much."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stepped aside,<br> And the dark shade her raiment black did hide<br> As they passed through into the dusky hall,<br> Afraid to see her face, and last of all<br> Went Bodli, clashing through the porch, but he<br> Stayed in the midst, and turned round silently,<br> And sought her face and said:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thy will is done.<br> Is it enough? Art thou enough alone<br> As I am?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never any word she spake.<br> No hate was in her face now: "For thy sake<br> I did it, Gudrun. Speak one word to me<br> Before my bitter shame and misery<br> Crushes my heart to death."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reached a hand<br> Out toward the place where trembling he did stand,<br> But touched him not, and never did he know <A NAME="page_510"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 510</FONT></A><br> If she had mind some pity then to show<br> Unto him, or if rather more apart<br> She fain had thrust him from her raging heart,<br> For now those men came tramping from the hall,<br> And Bodli shrank aback unto the wall<br> To let them pass, and when the last was gone,<br> In the dim twilight there he stood alone,<br> Nor durst he follow her, but listened there,<br> Half dead, and but his breathing might he hear,<br> And the faint noises of the gathering night.<br> He stood so long that the moon cast her light<br> In through the porch, and still no sound he heard<br> But the faint clink of mail-rings as he stirred.<br> "Ah, she is dead of grief, or else would she<br> Have come to say some little word to me,<br> Since I so love her, love her!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a wail<br> He cried these words, and in the moonlight pale,<br> Clashing he turned: but e&#146;en therewith a shriek<br> From out the dead hush of the hall did break,<br> And then came footsteps hurrying to the porch,<br> And the red flare of a new-litten torch,<br> And smit by nameless horror and affright<br> He fled away into the moonlit night.</p>
