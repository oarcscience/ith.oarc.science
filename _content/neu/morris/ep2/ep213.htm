<p align="center"><i>The Dealings of King Olaf Tryggvison with the Icelanders</i>.</p>  
<p>NOW tells the tale that safe to Drontheim came<br> Kiartan with all his folk, and the great fame<br> Of Olaf Tryggvison then first they knew,<br> When thereof spake the townsmen to the crew,<br> But therewithal yet other news they heard,<br> Which seemed to one and all a heavy word;<br> How that the king, from the old customs turned,<br> Now with such zeal toward his new faith burned,<br> That thereby nothing else to him was good<br> But that all folk should bow before the Rood. <A NAME="page_386"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 386</FONT></A><br> When Kiartan's coming thitherward betid<br> Three ships of Iceland lay there in the Nid,<br> Manned by stout men enow; downcast were these<br> Who had been glad enow the king to please;<br> And save their goods, and lives, perchance, withal,<br> But knew not how their forefathers to call<br> Souls damned for ever and ever; yet they said<br> That matters drew so swiftly to a head,<br> That when they met the king he passed them by<br> With head turned round, or else with threatening eye<br> Scowled on them; "And when Yule-tide comes," said they,<br> "We look to have from him a settled day<br> When we must change our faith or bide the worst."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," Kiartan said, "this king is not the first<br> To think the world is made for him alone;<br> Who knows how things will go ere all is done?<br> God wot, I wish my will done even as he;<br> I hate him not."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therewith merrily<br> From out the ship the men of Herdholt went;<br> A bright eve was it, and the good town sent<br> Thin smoke and blue straight upward through the air,<br> For it had rained of late, and here and there<br> Sauntered the townsfolk, man and maid and child;<br> Where street met quay a fiddle's sound beguiled<br> A knot of listening folk, who no less turned<br> And stared hard as the westering sunbeams burned <A NAME="page_387"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 387</FONT></A><br> Upon the steel and scarlet of that band,<br> Whom, as ye well may wot, no niggard hand<br> Had furnished forth; so up the long street then,<br> Gazing about, well gazed at, went the men,<br> A goodly sight. But e&#146;en as they would wend<br> About the corner where that street had end,<br> High up in air nearby &#146;gan ring a chime<br> Whose sweetness seemed to bless e&#146;en that sweet time<br> With double blessing. Kiartan stayed his folk<br> When first above his head that sound outbroke,<br> And listened smiling, till he heard a sigh<br> Close by him, and met Bodli's wandering eye<br> That fell before his.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Softly Kiartan spake:<br> "Now would Gudrun were here e&#146;en for the sake<br> Of this sweet sound! nought have I heard so sweet."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on they passed, and turned about the street,<br> And saw the great church cast its shadow down<br> Upon the low roofs of the goodly town,<br> And yet awhile they stayed there marvelling;<br> But therewith heard behind them armour ring,<br> And turning, saw a gallant company<br> Going afoot, and yet most brave to see,<br> Come toward the church, and nigher as they drew<br> It was to Kiartan even as if he knew<br> One man among them, taller by the head<br> Than any there, and clad in kirtle red,<br> Girt with a sword, with whose gold hilt he played <A NAME="page_388"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 388</FONT></A><br> With his left hand, the while his right did shade<br> His eyes from the bright sun that &#146;gainst him blazed,<br> As on the band of Icelanders he gazed;<br> Broad-shouldered was he, grand to look upon,<br> And in his red beard tangled was the sun<br> That lit his bright face up in wrathful wise,<br> That fiercer showed his light-grey eager eyes.<br> Now ere he came quite close, sidelong he bent<br> Unto a man who close beside him went,<br> Then turned, and gazed at Kiartan harder yet,<br> As he passed by, and therewith their eyes met,<br> And Kiartan's heart beat, and his face grew bright,<br> His eyes intent as if amidst a fight,<br> Yet on his lips a smile was, confident,<br> Devoid of hate, as by him the man went.<br> But Bodli said, "Let us begone ere day<br> Is fully passed, if even yet we may;<br> This is the king, and what then may we do<br> &#146;Gainst such a man, a feeble folk and few?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Kiartan turned upon him loftily,<br> And said, "Abide! I do not look to die<br> Ere we get back to Iceland; one there is,<br> Thou knowst, therein, to hold through woe and bliss<br> My soul from its departing; go we then<br> And note the way of worship of these men."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on that eve about the church they hung,<br> And through the open door heard fair things sung, <A NAME="page_389"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 389</FONT></A><br> And sniffed the incense; then to ship they went.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the next morn the king to Kiartan sent<br> To bid him come unto the royal hall,<br> Where nought but good to him and his should fall;<br> Close by the ship upon the sunny quay<br> Was Kiartan, when the man these words did say,<br> Amid a ring of Icelanders, who sat<br> Upon the bales of unshipped goods: with that<br> Kiartan stood up and said unto the man:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Undo thy kirtle if thy worn hands can!<br> Show us thy neck where the king's chain has galled;<br> But tell us not whereby thy sire was called<br> Lest some of these should blush&#151;go tell the king<br> That I left Iceland for another thing<br> Than to curse all the dead men of my race,<br> To make him merry&#151;lengthen not thy face,<br> For thou shalt tell him therewithal, that I<br> Will do him service well and faithfully<br> As a free man may do; else let him take<br> What he can get of me for his God's sake."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence there was about him at this word,<br> Except that Bodli muttered in his beard:<br> "Now certainly a good reward we have,<br> In that we cast away what fortune gave,<br> Yet doubtless shall our names be bruited far <A NAME="page_390"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 390</FONT></A><br> When we are dead&#151;then, too, no longings are<br> For what we may not have."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So as he came<br> The man went, and e&#146;en Kiartan now had blame<br> For his rash word. "What will ye, friends?" he said,<br> "The king is wise; his wrath will well be weighed;<br> He knoweth that we shall not fall for nought.<br> Should I speak soft?&#151;why then should we be brought,<br> Unarmed belike, and helpless, one by one<br> Up to the bishop when the feast was done&#151;<br> What, K&aacute;lf! thou say&#146;st, aboard, and let us weigh?<br> Yes, and be overhauled ere end of day<br> By the king's longships&#151;nay, friends, all is well;<br> And at the worst shall be a tale to tell<br> Ere all is o&#146;er."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hearkened, and cast fear<br> Aside awhile; for death had need be near<br> Unto such men for them to heed him aught.<br> So the time passed, and the king harmed them nought<br> And sent no message more to them, and they<br> Were lodged within the town, and day by day<br> Went here and there in peace, till Yule drew nigh.<br> And now folk said the feast would not pass by<br> Without some troubling of the ancient faith<br> At the king's hands, and war and ugly death<br> Drew round the season of the peace on earth<br> The angels sang of at that blessed birth.<br> Put whoso gloomed at tidings men might show, <A NAME="page_391"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 391</FONT></A><br> It was not Kiartan; wary was he though,<br> And weighed men's speech well; and upon a day<br> He, casting up what this and that might say,<br> All Iceland folk into one place did call,<br> And when they were assembled in the hall,<br> Spake on this wise:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fair fellows, well ye know,<br> The saw that says, <i>the wise saves blow by blow;</i><br> This king who lies so heavy on us here<br> Is a great man; his own folk hold him dear,<br> For he spares nought to them. Yet ye know well<br> That when his might on Hacon's fortune fell,<br> Great foes he left alive, and still they live.<br> Noble the man is; but yet who can give<br> Good fortune to his foe? and he must be,<br> Despite our goodwill, still our enemy.<br> I grudge it not, for noble seems the chance<br> The fortunes of a fair name to advance.<br> And so it may be, friends, that we shall free<br> The land this tide of the long tyranny<br> That Harald Fair-hair laid on it, and give<br> Unto all folk beneath just laws to live,<br> As in the old days&#151;shortly let us go,<br> When time shall serve, and to king Olaf show<br> That death breeds death; I say not this same night,<br> But hold ye ever ready for the fight,<br> And shun the mead-horn: Yule is close anigh<br> And the king's folk will drink abundantly;<br> Then light the torch and draw the whetted sword!&#151; <A NAME="page_392"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 392</FONT></A><br> &#151;A great man certes&#151;yet I marked this word<br> Said by his bishop&#151;many words he made<br> About a matter small if rightly weighed&#151;<br> <i>To die is gain</i>&#151;this king and I, and ye<br> Are young for that, yet so it well may be:<br> Some of us here are deemed to have done well;<br> How shall it be when folk our story tell<br> If we die grey-haired? honour fallen away,<br> Good faith lost, kindness perished&#151;for a day<br> Of little pleasure mingled with great pain&#151;<br> So will we not unto the Gods complain<br> Or draw our mouths awry with foolish hate,<br> This king and I, if &#146;neath the hand of fate<br> Sword to sword yet we meet: hearken once more&#151;<br> It seems the master of this new-found lore<br> Said to his men once, <i>Think ye that I bring<br> Peace upon earth? nay but a sword</i>&#151;O king,<br> Behold the sword ready to meet thy sword!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out sprang his bright steel at that latest word,<br> And bright the weapons glittered round about,<br> And the roof shook again beneath their shout;<br> But only Bodli, silent, pensive, stood,<br> As though he heeded nought of bad or good<br> In word or deed. But Kiartan, flushed and glad,<br> Noted him not, for whatso thought he had,<br> He deemed him ever ready in the end<br> To follow after as himself should wend.<br> Howso that was, now were these men at one, <A NAME="page_393"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 393</FONT></A><br> That e&#146;en as Kiartan bade it should be done,<br> And the king set on, ere on them he fell;<br> So then to meat they gat and feasted well;<br> But the next morn espial should be made<br> How best to do the thing that Kiartan bade.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morn came, and other news withal,<br> For by a messenger the king did call<br> The Icelanders to council in his house,<br> Bidding them note, that howso valorous<br> They might be, still but little doubt there was<br> That lightly he might bring their end to pass<br> If need should drive him thereto. "Yet," said he,<br> "Fain would I give you peace, though certainly<br> This tide but one of two things must ye choose,<br> Either nought else but life itself to lose,<br> Or else to come and hearken to my words<br> In the great hall whereas I see my lords."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kiartan gazed round about when this was said,<br> Smiling beneath a frown, his face flushed red<br> With wrath and shame. "Well," said he, "we are caught&#151;<br> The sluggards&#146; counsel morning brings to nought.<br> What say ye, shall we hold the feast at home?<br> Hearken, the guests get ready! shall they come?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For as he spake upon the wind was borne<br> Unto their ears the blast of a great horn, <A NAME="page_394"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 394</FONT></A><br> And smiled the messenger, and therewithal<br> Down from the minster roar of bells did fall,<br> Rung back and clashing; thereon Bodli spake:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou and I, cousin, for our honour's sake,<br> May be content to die; but what of these?<br> Thy part it is to bring us unto peace<br> If it may be; then, if the worst befall,<br> There can we die too, as in Atli's Hall<br> The Niblungs fell; nor worser will it sound<br> That thus it was, when we are underground,<br> And over there our Gudrun hears the tale."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent sat Kiartan, gazing on the pale<br> Set face of Bodli for a while, then turned<br> Unto his silent folk, and saw they yearned<br> For one chance more of life.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go, man," he said,<br> And tell thy king his will shall be obeyed<br> So far as this, that we will come to him;<br> But bid him guard with steel, head, breast, and limb,<br> Since as we come, belike, we shall not go,<br> And who the end of words begun can know.<br> Ho, friends! do on your war-gear! Fear ye not,<br> Since two good things to choose from have ye got:<br> Peace, or a famed death!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with both his ears<br> Ringing with clink of mail and clash of spears <A NAME="page_395"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 395</FONT></A><br> The messenger went forth upon his way;<br> And the king knew by spies, the wise ones say,<br> What counsel Kiartan gave his folk that eve,<br> And had no will in such great hands to leave<br> His chance of life or death. Now, armed at last,<br> The men of Iceland up the long street passed,<br> And saw few men there; wives and children stood<br> Before the doors to gaze, or in his hood<br> An elder muttered, as they passed him by,<br> Or sad-eyed maids looked on them longingly.<br> So came they to the great hall of the king,<br> And round about the door there stood a ring<br> Of tall men armed, and each a dreaded name;<br> These opened to them as anigh they came,<br> And then again drew close, and hemmed them in,<br> Nor spared they speech or laughter, and the din<br> Was great among them as all silently<br> The men of Herdholt passed the door-posts by.<br> Then through the hall's dusk Kiartan gazed, and saw<br> Small space whereby his company might draw<br> Nigh to the king, for there so thick men stood<br> That their tall spears were like a wizard's wood.<br> Now some way from the da&iuml;s must they stand<br> Where sat the king, and close to his right hand<br> The German bishop, but no heed at all<br> The king gave to our folk, as down the hall<br> His marshal cried for silence, and the din<br> Being quite appeased, in a clear voice and thin<br> The holy man &#146;gan to set forth the faith; <A NAME="page_396"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 396</FONT></A><br> But for these men brought nigh the gate of Death,<br> Hard was it now to weigh the right and wrong<br> Of what he said, that seemed both dull and long.<br> So when at last he came unto an end,<br> Uprose the king, and o&#146;er the place did send<br> A mighty voice: "Now have ye heard the faith,<br> And what the High God through his servant saith;<br> This is my faith: what say ye to it, then?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uprose a great shout from King Olaf's men,<br> And clash of tossing spears, and Bodli set<br> His hand upon his sword, while Kiartan yet<br> Stood still, and, smiling, eyed the king: and he<br> Turned on him as the din fell:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What say ye,<br> What say ye, Icelanders? thou specially?<br> I call thee yet a year too young to die,<br> Son of my namesake; neither seem&#146;st thou such<br> As who would trust in Odin overmuch,<br> Or pray long prayers to Thor, while yet thy sword<br> Hangs by thy side."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now at the king's first word<br> Down Kiartan stooped, and &#146;gan his shoe to lace,<br> And a dumb growl went through the crowded place<br> Like the far thunder while the sky is bright;<br> But when he rose again and stood upright<br> The king cried out:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Which man of these is he <A NAME="page_397"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 397</FONT></A><br> Who counselled you to slay no man but me<br> Amid my guards?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kiartan stood forth a space;<br> And said: "E&#146;en so, O king, thou biddst him face<br> Of his own will, the thing that all men fear,<br> Swift death and certain&#151;king, the man is here,<br> And in his own land, Kiartan Olafson<br> Men called him&#151;pity that his days are done,<br> For fair maids loved him."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he said the word<br> From out its sheath flamed forth the rover's sword,<br> And Bodli was beside him, and the hall<br> Was filled with fury now from wall to wall,<br> And back to back now stood the Herdholt band,<br> Each with his weapon gleaming in his hand.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then o&#146;er the clamour was the king's voice heard;<br> "Peace, men of mine, too quickly are ye stirred!<br> Do ye not see how that this man and I<br> Alone of men still let our sharp swords lie<br> Within their sheaths? Wise is the man to know<br> How troublous things among great men will go.<br> Speak, Kiartan Olafson! I offer thee<br> That in my court here thou abide with me,<br> Keeping what faith thou wilt; but let me deal<br> To these thy fellows either bane or weal,<br> As they shall do my bidding."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kinglike then,"<br> Said Kiartan, "dost thou speak about these men; <A NAME="page_398"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 398</FONT></A><br> Yea, like a fool, who knowest not the earth,<br> And what things thereon bring us woe or mirth;<br> No man there is of these but calls me friend;<br> Yea, and if all truth but this truth should end,<br> And sire, and love, and all were false to me,<br> Still should I look on my right hand to see<br> Bodli the son of Thorleik&#151;Come, then, death,'<br> Thy yokefellow am I."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from his sheath<br> Outsprang his sword, and even therewithal<br> Clear rang the Iceland shout amidst the hall,<br> And in a short space had the tale been o&#146;er,<br> But therewith Olaf stilled the noise once more,<br> And smiling said;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou growest angry, man!<br> Content thee, thou it was the strife began,<br> And now thou hast the best of it; come, then,<br> And sit beside me; thou and thy good men<br> Shall go in peace&#151;only, bethink thee how<br> In idle poet's lies thou needst must trow&#151;<br> Make no delay to take me by the hand,<br> Not meet it is that &#146;neath me thou shouldst stand."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Kiartan's face, pale erst with death, there rose<br> A sudden flush, and then his lips, set close,<br> And knitted brow, grew soft, and in his eyes<br> There came at first a look of great surprise,<br> Then kind they grew, and with shamefaced smile<br> He looked upon the king a little while, <A NAME="page_399"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 399</FONT></A><br> Then slowly sank his sword, and, taking it<br> By the sharp point, to where the king did sit<br> He made his way, and said:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, thou hast won;<br> Do thou for me what no man yet has done,<br> And take my sword, and leave me weaponless:<br> And if thy Christ is one who e&#146;en can bless<br> An earthly man, or heed him aught at all,<br> On me too let his love and blessing fall;<br> But if nor Christ, nor Odin help, why, then<br> Still at the worst are we the sons of men,<br> And will we, will we not, yet must we hope,<br> And after unknown happiness must grope,<br> Since the known fails us, as the elders say;<br> Though sooth, for me, who know no evil day,<br> Are all these things but words."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Put back thy blade,"<br> The king said, "thereof may I be apaid,<br> With thee to wield it for me; and now, come,<br> Deem of my land and house e&#146;en as thy home,<br> For surely now I know that this thy smile<br> The heart from man or maid can well beguile."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the king spake, drew Bodli nigh the place,<br> And a strange look withal there crossed his face;<br> It seemed he waited as a man in dread<br> What next should come; but little Kiartan said<br> Save thanks unto the king, and gayer now<br> Than men had seen him yet, he &#146;gan to grow. <A NAME="page_400"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 400</FONT></A><br> Then gave the king command, and presently<br> All strife was swallowed of festivity,<br> And in all joyance the time slipped away,<br> And a fair ending crowned a troublous day.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great love there grew &#146;twixt Kiartan and the king<br> From that time forth, and many a noble thing<br> Was planned betwixt them; and ere Yule was o&#146;er<br> White raiment in the Minster, Kiartan bore,<br> And he and his were hallowed at the font.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now so I deem it is, that use and wont,<br> The lords of men, the masks of many a face,<br> Raising the base perchance, somewhat abase<br> Those that are wise and noble; even so<br> O&#146;er Kiartan's head as day by day did go,<br> Worthier the king's court, and its ways &#146;gan seem<br> Than many a thing whereof he erst did dream,<br> And gay he grew beyond the wont of men.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with the king dwelt Ingibiorg as then,<br> His sister; unwed was she, fair of face,<br> Beloved and wise, not lacking any grace<br> Of mind or body: Often it befell<br> That she and Kiartan met, and more than well<br> She &#146;gan to love him; and he let her love,<br> Saying withal, that nought at all might move<br> His heart from Gudrun; and for very sooth<br> He might have held that word; but yet for ruth.<br> And a soft pleasure that he would not name <A NAME="page_401"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 401</FONT></A><br> All unrebuked he let her soft eyes claim<br> Kindness from his; and surely to the king<br> This love of theirs seemed a most happy thing,<br> And to himself he promised merry days,<br> And had in heart so Kiartan's state to raise<br> That he should be a king too.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But meanwhile,<br> Silent would Bodli go, without a smile<br> Upon his sad changed face from morn to eve;<br> And often now the thronged hall would he leave<br> To wander by the borders of the sea,<br> Waiting, half dreading, till some news should free<br> The band of Icelanders; most wearily<br> Month after month to him the days dragged by.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ye shall know that the king looked for news<br> Whether the folk of Iceland would refuse,<br> At the priest Thangbrand's word, to change their faith.<br> A man of violence, the story saith,<br> A lecher, and a manslayer&#151;tidings came<br> While yet the summer at its height did flame,<br> And Thangbrand brought it; little could he do,<br> Although indeed two swordsmen stout he slew,<br> Unto the holy faith folk's hearts to turn.<br> Hall of the Side, as in the tale we learn,<br> Gizur the White, and Hialti Skeggison,<br> With some few others, to the faith were won,<br> The most of men little these things would heed,<br> And some were furious heathens; so, indeed, <A NAME="page_402"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 402</FONT></A><br> To save his life he had to flee away.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wroth was the king hereat, and now would stay<br> The Iceland ships from sailing; little fain<br> Was Kiartan yet to get him back again,<br> Since he, forgetting not the former days&#151;<br> It might be&#151;passed his life fulfilled of praise,<br> And love, and glory. So the time went on,<br> Gizur the White and Hialti Skeggison,<br> Fleeing from Iceland, in the autumn-tide<br> Came out to Norway with the king to bide<br> Until the summer came, when they should go<br> Once more the truth of Christ's fair lore to show.<br> Long ago now of Gudrun and her ways,<br> And of the coming of those happy days<br> That were to be, had Kiartan ceased to speak<br> Unto his friend; who sullen now and weak,<br> Weary with waiting, faint with holding back<br> He scarcely knew from what, did surely lack<br> Some change of days if yet he was to live.<br> Tidings the new comers to him did give<br> From Laxdale, speaking lightly of the thing<br> That like a red-hot iron hand did wring<br> His weary heart; Gudrun was fair and well,<br> And still at Bathstead in good hope did dwell<br> Of Kiartan's swift return. That word or two,<br> That name, wrought in him, that at last he knew<br> His longing, and intent; and desolate<br> The passing of the days did he await,<br> Torn by remorse, tortured by fear, lest yet <A NAME="page_403"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 403</FONT></A><br> Kiartan the lapse of strange days should forget,<br> And take to heart the old familiar days,<br> And once more turn him to the bygone ways<br> Where they were happy&#151;but his fear was vain,<br> For if his friend of Iceland had been fain<br> Scarce had he gone; the king would keep him there<br> A pledge with other three, till he should hear<br> What thing the Icelanders this time would do,<br> Nor, as we said, had he good will to go<br> Whatso his power was: for so far things went<br> With Ingibiorg, that folk with one consent<br> Named her his bride that was to be, and said,<br> That sure a nobler pair were never wed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so the time passed, till the day came round<br> When at the quay the ships lay Iceland-bound,<br> And Bodli went to bid his friend farewell,<br> Flushed and bright-eyed, for wild hope, sooth to tell,<br> Had striven with shame, and cast its light on love,<br> Until a fairer sky there seemed above,<br> A fairer earth about, and still most fair<br> The fresh green sea that was to bring him there,<br> Whereon his heart was set.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O gay! O gay!"<br> Said Kiartan, "thou art glad to go away;<br> This is the best face I have seen on thee<br> Since first our black oars smote the Burgfirth sea."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as he spake a dark flush and a frown <A NAME="page_404"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 404</FONT></A><br> Swallowed up Bodli's smile; he cast adown<br> His eager eyes: "Thou art as glad to stay,<br> Belike," he said, "as I to go away.<br> What thinkest thou I plot against thee then?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou art the strangest of the sons of men,"<br> Said Kiartan, with a puzzled look. "Come now,<br> Leave off thy riddles, clear thy troubled brow,<br> And let me think of thee as in time past,<br> When ever a most merry lad thou wast!<br> Why talkest thou of plotting? True and leal<br> I deem thee ever as the well-tried steel<br> That hangs beside thee; neither cross at all<br> Our fond desires. Though whatso thing may fall<br> Still shall I trust thee."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His own face grew grave<br> As o&#146;er his heart there swept a sudden wave<br> Of the old thoughts. But Bodli said, "O friend,<br> Forgive my face fair looks and foul; I wend<br> Back to our kin and land, that gladdens me.<br> I leave thee here behind across the sea,<br> That makes me sad and sour."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not raise<br> His eyes up midst his words, or meet the gaze<br> Kiartan bent on him, till again he said:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Olaf shall hear of all the goodlihead<br> Thou gainest here. Thy brethren shall be glad<br> That thou such honour from all men hast had. <A NAME="page_405"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 405</FONT></A><br> Oswif the Wise no doubt I soon shall see&#151;<br> What shall I say to him?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then steadily<br> Gazed Kiartan on him. "Tell Gudrun all this<br> Thou knowest of, my honour and my bliss;<br> Say we shall meet again!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more they spake,<br> But kissed and parted; either's heart did ache<br> A little while with thought of the old days;<br> Then Bodli to the future turned his gaze,<br> Unhappy and remorseful, knowing well<br> How ill his life should go whate&#146;er befell.<br> But Kiartan, left behind, being such a man<br> As through all turns of fortune never can<br> Hold truce with fear or sorrow, lived his life<br> Not ill content with all the change and strife.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair goes the ship that beareth out Christ's truth,<br> Mingled of hope, of sorrow, and of ruth,<br> And on the prow Bodli the Christian stands,<br> Sunk deep in thought of all the many lands<br> The world holds, and the folk that dwell therein,<br> And wondering why that grief and rage and sin<br> Was ever wrought; but wondering most of all<br> Why such wild passion on his heart should fall. <A NAME="page_406"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 406</FONT></A></p>
