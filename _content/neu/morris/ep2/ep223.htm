<p align="center"><i>Thorhalla tells of Kiartan's Comings and Goings</i>.</p>  
<p>WHAT should the next move in the strange game be?<br> Kiartan rode through the country carelessly<br> With few behind him, but nought hitherto<br> The sons of Oswif durst against him do,<br> While he his hand withheld not utterly<br> From them; so doubtful did the days go by.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gudrun? Ah, the black spot in her heart<br> That rose when first she knew that one had part<br> In Kiartan's life, and ever greater grew,<br> When of his love toward this new love she knew,<br> Now at he last, when over sure she felt<br> That she no longer in his memory dwelt,<br> O&#146;erspread her life, till from the foiled desire<br> Cast back upon her heart, there sprang a fire<br> Of very hate: true was it, that at first<br> Bodli, herself, and all around she cursed<br> Rather than Kiartan&#151;Well, what will you have<br> That was ere hope had sunk into his grave, <A NAME="page_488"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 488</FONT></A><br> While yet some pleasure clung round Kiartan's name.<br> Then came the feast at Herdholt; then the shame<br> About the coif, and fear of shame again,<br> And many a tale told to make over plain<br> His love for Refna; then the evil hour,<br> When she within the darksome hall must cower<br> Among her trembling brethren: then, when she<br> Had looked at least a noble death to see,<br> Of one who loved her, Kiartan sent him back<br> A baffled man, as who all might did lack,<br> Yea, even the might to die; still, at each turn<br> Afresh this weary lesson must she learn;<br> With the wrong-doers hast thou taken part,<br> Live then, and die with them, for thy love's heart<br> Is now no more for thee! still everywhere<br> Did Kiartan's image meet her; the warm air<br> Of summer seemed but sent her from his hand,<br> The sea that beat the borders of the land<br> Still seemed to bear his fame unto her feet;<br> All summer sights and sounds, and odours sweet,<br> Were heavy with his memory: no least way<br> To &#146;scape from thought of him from day to day.<br> Withal, the sight of faces dull with hate<br> Of that same man, on every step did wait.<br> Familiar grew the muttering sullen voice<br> Of those who in no goodhap could rejoice,<br> Until the very thought and hope of strife,<br> The use of hate, must grow to be her life.<br> And shaped therefrom a dreadful longing rose, <A NAME="page_489"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 489</FONT></A><br> That some fell end the weary way would close,<br> Unto herself she scarce durst whisper what.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on a day three of her brothers sat<br> Within the hall, and talked, and she stood by<br> Hearkening their eager speech most wearily.<br> "The gabbling crone Thorhalla has just been,"<br> Said Ospak, "And whom think you she has seen?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, by thy scowl I know well," Thorolf said,<br> "&#146;Twas Kiartan Olafson, upon my head."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Thorolf, thou grow&#146;st wise&#151;now, said the crone,<br> That in her life she ne&#146;er saw such an one<br> As Kiartan looked, a loving maiden's dream<br> Of a great king, she said, the man did seem.<br> 'Well,' said I, 'and how long then will it last?'<br> 'Ah,' said the crone, 'till after ye are passed;<br> Why, the whole country-side is ringing now<br> With this, that ye had best be wise and bow<br> Before him humbly, since most kind is he;<br> Kind,' says the crone, 'certes he was to me.'<br> 'Well, well,' says I, 'but these are fools&#146; words here.'<br> 'Nay, let me speak,' she says, 'for he will fare<br> Unto the west to Knoll; this know I well,<br> Because to him therewith I needs must tell<br> Of one who owed me half a mark thereby. <A NAME="page_490"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 490</FONT></A><br> Well, goody, says he, I shall pass anigh,<br> And I will fetch it for thee&#151;lo, how kind.'"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now may God strike the gabbling idiot blind!"<br> Said Thorolf. "Nay," said Ospak, "not so wise<br> Thou growest now; rather, God keep her eyes!<br> Tidings she told me, saying he would bide<br> For just three days at Knoll, and thence will ride<br> Through Swinedale home, close here, nor like that he<br> Will ride by us with a great company,<br> Say two at most&#151;good luck go with his pride,<br> Whereby so fair a chance doth us betide!&#151;<br> Bodli shall lead or die."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Gudrun turned<br> Sick-hearted from them; how her longing burned<br> Within her heart! ah, if he died not now,<br> How might she tell whereto his hate would grow?<br> Yet a strange hope that longing shot across,<br> As she got thinking what would be the loss<br> If Bodli fell &#146;neath Kiartan's hand. That day,<br> Like years long told, past Gudrun wore away,<br> She knew not how; but when the next day came<br> She cried aloud, "The same, ah, still the same,<br> Shall every day be, now that he is dead!"<br> She started as she heard her voice, her head<br> Seemed filled with flame: she crawled unto her bower<br> And at her mirrored face hour after hour<br> She stared, and wondered what she really was,<br> The once-loved thing o&#146;er which his lips would pass. <A NAME="page_491"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 491</FONT></A><br> Her feet grew heavy at the end of day,<br> Her heart grew faint, upon her bed she lay<br> Moveless for many an hour, until the sun<br> Told her that now the last day was begun;<br> Then she arose as one might in a dream<br> To clothe herself, till a great cloud did seem<br> To draw away from her; as in bright hell,<br> Sunless but shadowless she saw full well<br> Her life that was and would be, now she knew<br> The deed unmasked that summer day should do.<br> And then she gnashed her teeth and tore her hair,<br> And beat her breast, nor lightened thus despair,<br> As over and over the sweet names she told<br> Whereby he called her in the days of old;<br> And then she thought of Refna's longing eyes,<br> And to her face a dreadful smile did rise<br> That died amidst its birth, as back again<br> Her thoughts went to the tender longing pain<br> She once had deemed a sweet fair day would end;<br> And therewith such an agony did rend<br> Her body and soul, that all things she forgat<br> Amidst of it; upon the bed she sat<br> Rigid and stark, and deemed she shrieked, yet made<br> No sound indeed; but slowly now did fade<br> All will away from her, until the sun<br> Risen higher, on her moveless body shone,<br> And as a smitten thing beneath its stroke<br> She shrank and started, and awhile awoke<br> To hear the tramp of men about the hall. <A NAME="page_492"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 492</FONT></A><br> Then did a hand upon the panel fall;<br> And in her very soul she heard the ring<br> Of weapons pulled adown, and every thing,<br> Yea, even pain, was dead a little space.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last she woke to see the haggard face<br> Of Bodli o&#146;er her own: "I go," he said,<br> "Would God that thou mayst hear of me as dead<br> Ere the sun sets to-day."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She passed her hand<br> Across her eyes, as he in arms did stand<br> Before her there, and stared but answered not,<br> As though indeed his face were clean forgot;<br> Yet her face quickened as his eyes she saw<br> So full of ruth yet nigher to her draw:<br> She shrank aback, but therewith suddenly<br> A thought smote through her, with an angry cry<br> She sprang up from the bed, naked and white<br> Her gold hair glittering in the sunshine bright<br> That flooded all the place; his arm she caught<br> And stared into his eyes:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is thy thought?"<br> She said, "why goest thou with these murderous men?<br> Ah! dost thou think thou yet mayst save him then?<br> Ah! dost thou think that thou mayst still be kind<br> To every one, fool as thou art and blind,<br> Yet work thy wicked will to pleasure thee?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across her passion he began to see <A NAME="page_493"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 493</FONT></A><br> That now she doubted him; he muttered low:<br> "The work of these my hands what man can know?<br> And yet at least the end shall be to-day."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She fell aback nor noted more, but lay<br> All huddled up upon the bed, her hair<br> O&#146;er her white body scattered here and there,<br> And as he gazed on her he saw she wept,<br> And a wild passion o&#146;er his heart there swept,<br> And twice he stretched his arms out, to embrace<br> His curse and his delight, twice turned his face<br> Unto the door that led unto the hall,<br> Then with a cry upon her did he fall<br> And, sobbing, strained her to his mail-clad breast,<br> And to her writhen lips his lips he pressed,<br> And moaned o&#146;er her wet cheeks, and kissed her eyes<br> That knew him not; till in his heart &#146;gan rise,<br> Now at the last, a glory in his shame,<br> A pride to take the whole world's bitter blame;<br> And like a god he felt, though well he deemed<br> That to an end at last his dream was dreamed.<br> And she, she knew him not, her arms fell down<br> Away from him, her drawn mouth and set frown<br> Were not for him, she did not shrink from him,<br> She turned not round to curse or bless, when dim<br> She lay before his burning eyes once more,<br> Her long hair gilding the white bed-clothes o&#146;er,<br> As midst low restless moaning there she tossed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wildly he cried: "Oh, Gudrun, thou hast lost, <A NAME="page_494"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 494</FONT></A><br> But look on me for I have never won!"<br> Then from the place he rushed, and with the sun<br> Burst into the dusk hall, a stream of light,<br> Neath his dark hair, his face so strange and white<br> That a dead man dragged up into the day<br> By wizard's arts he seemed to be, and they<br> Who waited armed there, and the last cup drank<br> Looked each at each, and from his presence shrank.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For there were gathered now the murderous band,<br> Long to be cursed thereafter through the land,<br> Gudrun's five brethren, and three stout men more.<br> Then Ospak cried, "Soon shall our shame be o&#146;er,<br> And thou and we shall be great men and famed,<br> And Bathstead free; come now, since thou art named<br> Our leader, husband of Gudrun, lead forth!<br> For this day shall be called a day of worth,<br> By those that tell the story of our house."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flushed were the men, and fierce and boisterous,<br> And Bodli trembled in his helpless rage<br> To be among them, but his sin's strong cage<br> Was strait and strong about him: with no word<br> He girt to him the rover's deadly sword,<br> And did his helm on: and so forth they wend<br> Through the bright morn to bring about the end.</p>
