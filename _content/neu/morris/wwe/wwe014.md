CHAPTER 13

The Streets of the Burg of the Four Friths

He went about the streets and found them all much like to the one which
they had entered by the north gate; he saw no poor or wretched houses,
and none very big as of great lords; they were well and stoutly builded,
but as aforesaid not much adorned either with carven work or painting:
there were folk enough in the streets, and now Ralph, as was like to be,
looked specially at the women, and thought many of them little
better-favoured than the men, being both dark and low; neither were they
gaily clad, though their raiment, like the houses, was stout and well
wrought.  But here and there he came on a woman taller and whiter than
the others, as though she were of another blood; all such of these as he
saw were clad otherwise than the darker women: their heads uncoifed,
uncovered save for some garland or silken band: their gowns yellow like
wheat-straw, but gaily embroidered; sleeveless withal and short, scarce
reaching to the ancles, and whiles so thin that they were rather clad
with the embroidery than the cloth; shoes they had not, but sandals
bound on their naked feet with white thongs, and each bore an iron ring
about her right arm.

The more part of the men wore weapons at their sides and had staves in
hand, and were clad in short jerkins brown or blue of colour, and looked
ready for battle if any moment should call them thereto; but among them
were men of different favour and stature from these, taller for the most
part, unarmed, and clad in long gowns of fair colours with cloths of
thin and gay-coloured web twisted about their heads. These he took for
merchants, as they were oftenest standing in and about the booths and
shops, whereof there were some in all the streets, though the market for
victuals and such like he found over for that day, and but scantily
peopled.

Out of one of these markets, which was the fish and fowl market, he came
into a long street that led him down to a gate right over against that
whereby he had entered the Burg; and as he came thereto he saw that
there was a wide way clear of all houses inside of the wall, so that
men-at-arms might go freely from one part to the other; and he had also
noted that a wide way led from each port out of the great place, and
each ended not but in a gate. But as to any castle in the town, he saw
none; and when he asked a burgher thereof, the carle laughed in his
face, and said to him that the whole Burg, houses and all, was a castle,
and that it would turn out to be none of the easiest to win. And
forsooth Ralph himself was much of that mind.

Now he was just within the south gate when he held this talk, and there
were many folk thereby already, and more flocking thereto; so he stood
there to see what should betide; and anon he heard great blowing of
horns and trumpets all along the wall, and, as he deemed, other horns
answered from without; and so it was; for soon the withoutward horns
grew louder, and the folk fell back on either side of the way, and next
the gates were thrown wide open (which before had been shut save for a
wicket) and thereafter came the first of a company of men-at-arms,
foot-men, with bills some, and some with bows, and all-armed knights and
sergeants a-horseback.

So streamed in these weaponed men till Ralph saw that it was a great
host that was entering the Burg; and his heart rose within him, so
warrior-like they were of men and array, though no big men of their
bodies; and many of them bore signs of battle about them, both in the
battering of their armour and the rending of their raiment, and the
clouts tied about the wounds on their bodies.

After a while among the warriors came herds of neat and flocks of sheep
and strings of horses, of the spoil which the host had lifted; and then
wains filled, some with weapons and war gear, and some with bales of
goods and household stuff.  Last came captives, some going afoot and
some for weariness borne in wains; for all these war-taken thralls were
women and women-children; of males there was not so much as a little
lad.  Of the women many seemed fair to Ralph despite their grief and
travel; and as he looked on them he deemed that they must be of the
kindred and nation of the fair white women he had seen in the streets;
though they were not clad like those, but diversely.

So Ralph gazed on this pageant till all had passed, and he was weary
with the heat and the dust and the confused clamour of shouting and
laughter and talking; and whereas most of the folk followed after the
host and their spoil, the streets of the town there about were soon left
empty and peaceful. So he turned into a street narrower than most, that
went east from the South Gate and was much shaded from the afternoon
sun, and went slowly down it, meaning to come about the inside of the
wall till he should hit the East Gate, and so into the Great Place when
the folk should have gone their ways home.

He saw no folk in the street save here and there an old woman sitting at
the door of her house, and maybe a young child with her. As he came to
where the street turned somewhat, even such a carline was sitting on a
clean white door-step on the sunny side, somewhat shaded by a tall
rose-laurel tree in a great tub, and she sang as she sat spinning, and
Ralph stayed to listen in his idle mood, and he heard how she sang in a
dry, harsh voice:

    Clashed sword on shield In the harvest field;  
    And no man blames The red red flames,  
    War's candle-wick On roof and rick.  
    Now dead lies the yeoman unwept and unknown  
    On the field he hath furrowed, the ridge he hath sown:  
    And all in the middle of wethers and neat  
    The maidens are driven with blood on their feet;  
    For yet 'twixt the Burg-gate and battle half-won  
    The dust-driven highway creeps uphill and on,  
    And the smoke of the beacons goes coiling aloft,  
    While the gathering horn bloweth loud, louder and oft.

    Throw wide the gates  
    For nought night waits;  
    Though the chase is dead  
    The moon's o'erhead  
    And we need the clear  
    Our spoil to share.  
    Shake the lots in the helm then for brethren are we,  
    And the goods of my missing are gainful to thee.  
    Lo! thine are the wethers, and his are the kine;  
    And the colts of the marshland unbroken are thine,  
    With the dapple-grey stallion that trampled his groom;  
    And Giles hath the gold-blossomed rose of the loom.  
    Lo! leaps out the last lot and nought have I won,  
    But the maiden unmerry, by battle undone.

Even as her song ended came one of those fair yellow-gowned damsels
round the corner of the street, bearing in her hand a light basket full
of flowers: and she lifted up her head and beheld Ralph there; then she
went slowly and dropped her eyelids, and it was pleasant to Ralph to
behold her; for she was as fair as need be.  Her corn-coloured gown was
dainty and thin, and but for its silver embroidery had hidden her limbs
but little; the rosiness of her ancles showed amidst her white
sandal-thongs, and there were silver rings and gold on her arms along
with the iron ring.

Now she lifted up her eyes and looked shyly at Ralph, and he smiled at
her well-pleased, and deemed it would be good to hear her voice; so he
went up to her and greeted her, and she seemed to take his greeting
well, though she glanced swiftly at the carline in the doorway.

Said Ralph:  "Fair maiden, I am a stranger in this town, and have seen
things I do not wholly understand; now wilt thou tell me before l ask
the next question, who will be those war-taken thralls whom even now I
saw brought into the Burg by the host? of what nation be they, and of
what kindred?"

Straightway was the damsel all changed; she left her dainty tricks, and
drew herself up straight and stiff.  She looked at him in the eyes,
flushing red, and with knit brows, a moment, and then passed by him with
swift and firm feet as one both angry and ashamed.

But the carline who had beheld the two with a grin on her wrinkled face
changed aspect also, and cried out fiercely after the damsel, and said:
"What! dost thou flee from the fair young man, and he so kind and soft
with thee, thou jade?  Yea, I suppose thou dost fetch and carry for some
mistress who is young and a fool, and who has not yet learned how to
deal with the daughters of thine accursed folk. Ah! if I had but money
to buy some one of you, and a good one, she should do something else for
me than showing her fairness to young men; and I would pay her for her
long legs and her white skin, till she should curse her fate that she
had not been born little and dark-skinned and free, and with heels
un-bloodied with the blood of her back."

Thus she went on, though the damsel was long out of ear-shot of her
curses; and Ralph tarried not to get away from her spiteful babble,
which he now partly understood; and that all those yellow-clad damsels
were thralls to the folk of the Burg; and belike were of the kindred of
those captives late-taken whom he had seen amidst the host at its
entering into the Burg.

So he wandered away thence thinking on what he should do till the sun
was set, and he had come into the open space underneath the walls, and
had gone along it till he came to the East Gate: there he looked around
him a little and found people flowing back from the Great Place, whereto
they had gathered to see the host mustered and the spoil blessed; then
he went on still under the wall, and noted not that here and there a man
turned about to look upon him curiously, for he was deep in thought,
concerning the things which he had seen and heard of, and pondered much
what might have befallen his brethren since they sundered at the
Want-way nigh to the High House of Upmeads. Withal the chief thing that
he desired was to get him away from the Burg, for he felt himself unfree
therein; and he said to himself that if he were forced to dwell among
this folk, that he had better never have stolen himself away from his
father and mother; and whiles even he thought that he would do his best
on the morrow to get him back home to Upmeads again. But then when he
thought of how his life would go in his old home, there seemed to him a
lack, and when he questioned himself as to what that lack was,
straightway he seemed to see that Lady of the Wildwood standing before
the men-at-arms in her scanty raiment the minute before his life was at
adventure because of them. And in sooth he smiled to himself then with a
beating heart, as he told himself that above all things he desired to
see that Lady, whatever she might be, and that he would follow his
adventure to the end until he met her.

Amidst these thoughts he came unto the North Gate, whereby he had first
entered the Burg, and by then it was as dark as the summer night would
be; so he woke up from his dream, as it were, and took his way briskly
back to the Flower de Luce.
