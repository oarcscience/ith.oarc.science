<p><FONT SIZE="-1">BELLEROPHON bore unawares to Jobates King of Lycia the deadly message of King Pr&#156;tus: wherefore the Lycian King threw him often in the way of death, but the Fates willed him not to perish so, but gave him rather great honour and a happy life.</FONT></p>  
<p>LO ye have erst heard how Bellerophon<br> Left Argos with his fortune all undone,<br> Well deeming why, and with a certain scorn,<br> Rather than anger, in his heart new-born,<br> To mingle with old courage, and the hope<br> That yet with life's wild tangle he might cope,<br> Nor be so wholly beaten in the end:<br> Whatever pain he gat from failing friend,<br> And earth made lonely for his feet again,<br> The brightness of his youth might nowise wane<br> Before it, or his hardihood grow dim.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now the evening sun shines fair on him<br> In Lycia, as he goes up from the quays,<br> Well pleased beneath the new folk's curious gaze <A NAME="page_235"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 235</FONT></A><br> With all the fair things that his eyes behold:<br> As goodly as the tale was that men told<br> Of King Jobates&#146; city, goodlier<br> Than all they told it seemeth to him here,<br> And mid things new and strange and fairly wrought<br> Small care he hath for any anxious thought.<br> And so amid the shipmen's company<br> He came unto the King's hall, builded high<br> Above the market-place, and no delay<br> In getting speech of the great King had they,<br> For ever King Jobates' wont it was<br> To learn of new-corners things brought to pass<br> In outlands, and he served in noble wise<br> Such guests as might seem trusty to his eyes.<br> So in the midmost of his company<br> He passed in through the hall, and seemed to be<br> A very god chance-come among them there,<br> Though little splendid soothly was his gear;<br> A bright steel helm upon his brows he had,<br> And in a dark blue kirtle was he clad,<br> And a grey cloak thereover; bright enow<br> With gold and gems his great sword's hilt did glow,<br> But no such thing was in aught else he wore;<br> A spear great-shafted his strong right hand bore,<br> And in his left King Pr&#156;tus' casket shone:<br> Grave was his face now, though there played thereon<br> A flickering smile, that erst you might have seen<br> In such wise play, when small space was between<br> The spears he led and fierce eyes of the foe. <A NAME="page_236"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 236</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus through the Lycian court-folk did they go<br> Till to the King they came: e&#146;en such a man<br> As sixty summers made not pinched or wan,<br> Though beard and hair alike were white as snow.<br> Down on the sea-farers did he gaze now<br> With curious peering eyes, and now and then<br> He smiled and nodded, as he saw such men<br> Amidst them as he knew in other days;<br> But when he met Bellerophon's frank gaze,<br> There his eyes rested, and he said: "O guest,<br> Though among these thy gear is not the best,<br> Yet know I no man more if thou art not<br> E&#146;en that Bellerophon, who late hast got<br> Such praise mid men of Argos, that thy name<br> Two months agone to this our country came,<br> Adorned with many tales of deeds of thine;<br> And certainly as of a man divine<br> Thy mien is and thy face: how sayest thou?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So am I called," he said, "mid all men now,<br> Since that unhappy day that drave me forth,<br> Lacking that half that was of greatest worth,<br> And made me worthy&#151;for my deeds, O King,<br> What I have done is but a little thing;<br> I wrought that I might live from day to day,<br> That something I might give for hire and pay<br> Unto my lord; from whom I bring to thee<br> A message written by him privily,<br> Hid in this casket; take it from my hand, <A NAME="page_237"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 237</FONT></A><br> And do thou worthily to this my band,<br> And let us soon depart, for I am fain<br> The good report of other men to gain,<br> Wide through the world;&#151;nor do thou keep me here<br> As one unto King Pr&#156;tus&#146; heart right dear,<br> Because I deem that I have done amiss<br> Unto him, though I wot not how it is<br> That I have sinned: certes he bade me flee,<br> And ere he went my face he would not see;<br> Therefore I bid thee, King, to have a care<br> Lest on a troublous voyage thou shouldst fare."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sweet is thy voice," the King said; "many a maid<br> Among our fairest would be well a-paid<br> In listening to thy words a summer day.<br> Nor will our honour let thee go away<br> Whatso thy deed is, though I deem full well<br> But little ill there is of thee to tell.<br> Give forth the casket; in good time will we<br> This message of the King of Argos see,<br> And do withal what seemeth good therein.<br> Sit ye, O guests, for supper doth begin!&#151;<br> Ho! marshals, give them room; but thou sit here,<br> And gather heart the deeds of Kings to bear<br> While yet thou mayst, and here with me rejoice,<br> Forgetting much; for certes in thy voice<br> Was wrath e&#146;en now, and unmeet anger is<br> To mingle with our short-lived spell of bliss."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then sat Bellerophon adown and thought <A NAME="page_238"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 238</FONT></A><br> How fate his wandering footsteps erst had brought<br> To such another place, and of the end,<br> Whate&#146;er it was, that fate to him did send.<br> Yet since the time was fair, and day by day<br> Ever some rag of fear he cast away,<br> And ever less doubt of himself he had,<br> In that bright concourse was he blithe and glad,<br> And the King blessed the fair and merry tide<br> That set so blithe a fellow by his side.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>BUT the next day, in honour of the guest,<br> The King bade deck all chambers with his best,<br> And bid all folk to joyous festival,<br> And let the heralds all the fair youth call<br> To play within the lists at many a game;<br> "Since here last eve the great Corinthian came<br> That ye have heard of: and though ye indeed<br> Of more than manly strength may well have need<br> To match him, do your best, lest word he bear<br> Too soft that now the Lycian folk live here,<br> Forgetting whence their fathers came of yore<br> And whom their granddames to their grandsires bore."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So came the young men thronging, and withal <A NAME="page_239"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 239</FONT></A><br> Before the altars did the oxen fall<br> To many a god, the well-washed fleeces fair<br> In their own bearers' blood were dyed, and there<br> The Persian merchants stood and snuffed the scent<br> Of frankincense, for which of old they went<br> Through plain and desert waterless, and faced<br> The lion-haunted woods that edged the waste.<br> Then in the lists were couched the pointless spears,<br> The oiled sleek wrestler struggled with his peers,<br> The panting runner scarce could see the crown<br> Held by white hands before his visage brown;<br> The horses, with no hope of gold or gain,<br> With fluttering hearts remembered not the rein<br> Nor thought of earth. And still all things fared so,<br> That all who with the hero had to do<br> Deemed him too strong for mankind; or if one<br> Gained seeming victory on Bellerophon,<br> He knew it for a courteous mockery<br> Granted to him. So did the day go by,<br> And others like it, and the talk still was<br> How even now such things could come to pass<br> That such a man upon the earth was left.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the ninth sun from the earth had reft<br> Silence, and rest from care, then the King sent<br> To see Bellerophon, who straightly went,<br> And found Jobates with a troubled face,<br> Pacing a chamber of the royal place<br> From end to end, who turned as he drew near, <A NAME="page_240"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 240</FONT></A><br> And said in a low voice, "What dost thou here?<br> This is a land with many dangers rife;<br> Hast thou no heed to save thy joyous life?<br> The wide sea is before thee, get thee gone,<br> All lands are good for thee but this alone!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the hero strove to catch his eye<br> And &#146;gan to speak, he passed him hurriedly,<br> And gat him from the chamber: with a smile<br> Bellerophon turned too within a while,<br> When he could gather breath from such a speech,<br> And said, "Far then King Pr&#156;tus' arm can reach:<br> So was it as I doubted; yet withal<br> Not everything to every king will fall<br> As he desires it, and the Gods are good;<br> Nor shall the Lycian herbage drink my blood:&#151;<br> The Gods are good, though far they drive me forth;<br> But the four quarters, south, west, east, and north,<br> All are alike to me, who therein have<br> None left me now to weep above my grave<br> Whereso I fall: and fair things shall I see,<br> Nor may great deeds be lacking unto me:&#151;<br> Would I were gone then!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with that last word<br> Light footsteps drawing swiftly nigh he heard,<br> And made a shift therewith his eyes to raise,<br> Then staggering back, bewildered with amaze,<br> Caught at the wall and wondered if he dreamed,<br> For there before his very eyes he seemed <A NAME="page_241"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 241</FONT></A><br> To see the Lycian Sthenob&#156;a draw nigh;<br> But as he strove with his perplexity<br> A soft voice reached his ears, and then he knew<br> That in one mould the Gods had fashioned two,<br> But given them hearts unlike; yea, and her eyes<br> Looked on his troubled face in no such wise<br> As had the other's; wistful these and shy,<br> And seemed to pray, Use me not cruelly,<br> I have not harmed thee.&#151;Thus her soft speech ran:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Far have I sought thee, O Corinthian man,<br> And now that I have found thee my words fail,<br> Though erst my heart had taught me well my tale."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused, her half-closed lips were e&#146;en as sweet<br> As the sweet sounds that thence the air did meet,<br> And such a sense swept o&#146;er Bellerophon<br> As whiles in spring had come, and lightly gone<br> Ere he could name it; like a wish it was,<br> A wish for something that full swift did pass,<br> To be forgotten.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some three paces were<br> Betwixt them when she first had spoken there,<br> But now, as though it were unwittingly,<br> He slowly moved a little more anigh;<br> But she flushed red now ere she spake once more,<br> And faltered and looked down upon the floor.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O Prince Bellerophon," at last she said, <A NAME="page_242"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 242</FONT></A><br> "I dreamed last night that I beheld thee dead;<br> I knew thee thus, for twice had I seen thee,<br> Unseen myself, in this festivity;<br> And since I know how loved a man thou art,<br> Here have I come, to bid thee to depart,<br> Since that thou mayst do yet."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nigher he came<br> And said, "O fair one, I am but a name<br> To thee, as men are to the Gods above;<br> And what thing, then, thy heart to this did move?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So spake he, knowing scarce what words he said,<br> Strange his own voice seemed to him; and the maid<br> Spake not at first, but grew pale, and there passed<br> A quivering o&#146;er her lips; but at the last,<br> With eyes fixed full upon him, thus she spake:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why should I lie? this did I for thy sake,<br> Because thou art the worthiest of all men,<br> The loveliest to look on. Hear me, then;<br> But ere my tale is finished, speak thou not,<br> Because this moment has my heart waxed hot,<br> And I can speak before I go my way&#151;<br> Before thou leav&#146;st me.&#151;On my bed I lay,<br> And dreamed I fared within the Lycian land,<br> And still about me there on either hand<br> Were nought but poisonous serpents, yet no dread<br> I had of them, for soothly in my head <A NAME="page_243"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 243</FONT></A><br> The thought was, that my kith and kin they were;<br> But as I went methought I saw thee there<br> Coming on toward me, and thou mad&#146;st as though<br> No whit about those fell worms thou didst know;<br> And then in vain I strove to speak to thee,<br> And bid thee get thee down unto the sea,<br> Where bode thy men ready at bench and mast;<br> But in my dream thou cam&#146;st unto me fast,<br> And unto speech we fell of e&#146;en such things<br> As please the sons and daughters of great kings;<br> And I must smile and talk, and talk and smile,<br> Though I beheld a serpent all the while<br> Draw nigh to strike thee: then&#151;then thy lips came<br> Close unto mine; and while with joy and shame<br> I trembled, in my ears a dreadful cry<br> Rang, and thou fellest from me suddenly<br> And layst dead at my feet: and then I spake<br> Unto myself, 'Would God that I could wake,'<br> But woke not, though my dream changed utterly,<br> Except that thou wert laid stark dead anigh.<br> Then in this palace were we, and the noise<br> Of many folk I heard, and a great voice<br> Rang o&#146;er it ever and again, and said,<br> <i>Bellerophon who would not love is dead</i>.<br> But I&#151;I moved not from thee, but I saw<br> Through the fair windows many people draw<br> Unto the lists, until withal it seemed<br> As though I never yet had slept or dreamed,<br> That all the games went on, where yesterday <A NAME="page_244"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 244</FONT></A><br> Thou like a god amidst of men didst play:<br> But yet through all, the great voice cried and said,<br> <i>Bellerophon who would not love is dead</i>.<br> This is the dream&#151;ah, hast thou heard me, then?<br> Abide no more, I say, among these men:<br> Think&#146;st thou the world without thy life can thrive,<br> More than my heart without thy heart can live?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost before her lips the words could say,<br> She turned her eager glittering eyes away,<br> And hurried past, and as her feet did bear<br> Her loveliness away, he seemed to hear<br> A sob come from her; but for him, he felt<br> As in some fair heaven all his own he dwelt,<br> As though he ne&#146;er of any woe had known,<br> So happy and triumphant had he grown.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he thus a little while had stood<br> With this new pleasure stirring all his blood,<br> He &#146;gan to think how that she was not there,<br> And &#146;thwart the glory of delight came care,<br> As uttermost desire so wrought in him,<br> That now in strange new tears his eyes did swim,<br> He scarce knew if for pleasure or for pain.<br> Of other things he strove to think in vain&#151;<br> Nought seemed they;&#151;the strange threatening of the King,<br> Nay the maid's dream&#151;it seemed a little thing<br> That he should read their meaning more than this:<br> 'Here in the land of Lycia dwells thy bliss; <A NAME="page_245"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 245</FONT></A><br> So much she loved thee that she wished thee gone,<br> That thou mightst live, though she were left alone;<br> Or else she had not left thee; failing not<br> To see how all the heart in thee waxed hot<br> To cast thine arms about her and to press<br> Her heart to thine and heal its loneliness.'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pity grew in him as he thought thereof,<br> And with its sweet content fed burning love,<br> Till all his life was swallowed by its flame,<br> And dead and past away were fear and shame,<br> Nor might he think that he could ever die.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now at last he with a passionate sigh<br> Turned from the place where he had seen her feet,<br> And murmured as he went, "O sweet, O sweet,<br> O sweet the fair morn that thou breathest in,<br> When thou, awakening lone, dost first begin<br> For one more day the dull blind world to bless<br> With sight of thine unmeasured loveliness."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So speaking, through a low door did he gain<br> A little garden; the fair morn did wane,<br> The day grew to its hottest, the warm air<br> Was little stirred, the o&#146;er-sweet lily there<br> With unbowed stem let fall upon the ground<br> Its fainting leaves; full was the air of sound<br> Of restless bees; from high elms far away<br> Came the doves' moan about the lost spring day,<br> And Venus&#146; sparrows twittered in the eaves <A NAME="page_246"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 246</FONT></A><br> Above his head. There &#146;twixt the languid leaves<br> And o&#146;er-blown blossoms he awhile did go,<br> Nursing his love till faint he &#146;gan to grow<br> For very longing, and love, bloomed an hour,<br> Began to show the thorn about the flower,<br> Yet sweet and sweet it was, until the thought<br> Of that departing to his mind was brought,<br> And though he laughed aloud with scorn of it,<br> Yet images of pain and death would flit<br> Across his love, until at last anew<br> He &#146;gan to think that deeds there were to do<br> In his old way, if there he still would bide.<br> Deeds must have birth from hope; grief must he hide,<br> And into hard resolve his longing chill,<br> If he would be god-loved and conquering still:<br> So back he turned into the house, in mind,<br> Whatso might hap, the King once more to find,<br> And crave for leave to serve him; for he deemed,<br> Whate&#146;er the King had warned or his love dreamed,<br> That he and youth &#146;gainst death were fellows twain<br> For years yet, whoso in the end should gain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep buried in his thoughts he went, but when<br> He drew anigh the hall a crowd of men<br> Were round about it; armed they were, indeed,<br> But rent and battered was their warlike weed,<br> And some lacked wounding weapons; some men leant<br> Weakly &#146;gainst pillars; some were so much spent<br> They wept for weariness and pain; no few <A NAME="page_247"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 247</FONT></A><br> Bore bandages the red blood struggled through;<br> E&#146;en such they seemed, the hero thought, as folk<br> That erst before his Argive spears had broke,<br> And at his feet their vain arms down had cast:<br> So, wondering thereat, through these folk he passed<br> Into the hall, where on the ivory throne<br> Jobates sat, with flushed face, gazing down<br> Upon the shrinking captains; therewithal<br> E&#146;en as he entered did the King's eyes fall<br> Upon him, and the King somewhat did start<br> At first, but then, as minding not the part<br> That he had played that morn, a gracious smile<br> Came o&#146;er his face; then spake he in a while:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look upon these, O wise Bellerophon,<br> And ask of them what glory they have won&#151;<br> Or ask them not, but listen unto me:<br> Over the mountain-passes that men see<br> Herefrom, a town there is, and therein dwell<br> Folk baser and more vile than men can tell;<br> A godless folk, without a law or priest;<br> A thankless folk, who at high-tide and feast<br> Remember not the Gods; no image there<br> Makes glad men's eyes, no painted story fair<br> Tells of past days; alone, unhelped they live,<br> And nought but curses unto any give:<br> A rude folk, nothing worth, without a head<br> To lead them forth,&#151;and this morn had I said<br> A feeble folk and bondsmen of mine own.<br> But now behold from this same borel town <A NAME="page_248"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 248</FONT></A><br> Are these men empty-handed now come back,<br> And midst these Solymi is little lack<br> This morn of well-wrought swords and silk attire<br> And gold that seven times o&#146;er has felt the fire.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lo now, thou spak&#146;st of wandering forth again&#151;<br> Rather be thou my man, and &#146;gainst these men<br> Lead thou mine army; nay, nor think to win<br> But little praise if thou dost well herein,<br> For these by yesterday are grown so great<br> That if thou winnest them, midst this red heat<br> Of victory, a great deed shalt thou do,<br> And great will thy reward be; wilt thou go?<br> Methought thou hadst a mind to serve me here."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as Bellerophon drew more anear,<br> He thought within his heart, "Ah, then, I know<br> From all these things why he would have me go;<br> Yet since indeed I may not quite depart<br> From Lycia now, because my new-smitten heart<br> Is bound with bonds of love unto the land,<br> Safer am I in armour, sword in hand,<br> Than midst these silken hangings and fair things,<br> That well I wot hide many poison-stings:<br> The Gods are great, nor midst of men am I<br> Of such as, once being threatened, quickly die."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he spake out: "O King, wilt thou then pray<br> To all the Gods to give me a good day?<br> For when I was a youth and dwelt at home <A NAME="page_249"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 249</FONT></A><br> Men deemed I knew somewhat of things to come,<br> And now methinks more dangers I foresee<br> Than any that have yet been forged for me."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King frowned at that word, and flushed blood-red,<br> As if against his will; but quickly said,<br> In a mild voice: "Be of good cheer, O son;<br> For if the Gods help not Bellerophon<br> They will not have to say, that in this land<br> I prayed their good-will for thee with close hand.<br> No god there is that hath an altar here<br> That shall not smoke with something he holds dear<br> While thou art absent from us&#151;but these men,<br> Worn as they are, are fain to try again,<br> As swiftly as may be, what from the Fates<br> In bloody fields the Lycian name awaits;<br> Mine armoury is not empty, yet there are<br> Unwounded men to furnish forth the war<br> Yea, and mine household-folk shall go with thee,<br> And none but women in mine house shall be,<br> Until the Lycian shield once more is clean<br> Through thee, as though no stain had ever been.<br> Canst thou be ready by the second day<br> Unto the Solymi to take thy way?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So be it," said the wise Corinthian;<br> "And here, O King, I make myself thy man&#151;<br> May the Gods make us faithful; but if worse <A NAME="page_250"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 250</FONT></A><br> Must happen, on his head fall all the curse<br> Who does the wrong!&#151;Now for thy part see thou<br> That we who go have everything enow;<br> Nor think to hear too soon of victory,<br> For though a spliced staff e&#146;en as strong may be<br> As one ne&#146;er broken, lean thou not thereon<br> Till o&#146;er the narrow way thy feet have won<br> And thou may&#146;st try it on the level grass.<br> Now give me leave,. for I am fain to pass<br> Thy men in order by me, and to find<br> How best thy wounded honour I may bind."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When first the hero's hand the King's hand took,<br> But ill belike Jobates that did brook,<br> And well-nigh drew it back; yet still it lay<br> And moved not, and the King made haste to say:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"May the Gods bless us both, as I bless thee,<br> Who at this tide givest good help to me!<br> Depart, brave man; and, doing but thy best,<br> Howe&#146;er fate goes, by me shalt thou be blest."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then went Bellerophon, and laboured sore<br> To give the Lycian folk good heart once more,<br> Till day passed into night, and in fair dream<br> And hopeful waking, happy love did gleam,<br> E&#146;en like the young sun, on the hero's head.<br> But when the next bright day was well-nigh dead, <A NAME="page_251"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 251</FONT></A><br> Within the brazen porch Bellerophon<br> Stood thinking o&#146;er all things that had been done.<br> Alone he was, and yearning for his love,<br> And longing for some deed the truth to prove<br> Of what seemed dreamlike now, midst all the stir<br> Of men and clash of arms; and wearier<br> He felt than need was, as the evening breeze<br> Raised up his hair. But while sweet images<br> His heart made now of what he once had seen,<br> There in the dusk, across the garden green,<br> A white thing fluttered; nor was steadier<br> His heart within him, as he thought of her,<br> And that perchance she came; and soon anigh<br> A woman drew, but stopping presently<br> Over against him, he could see her now<br> To be a handmaid, and, with knitted brow,<br> Was going thence, but through the dusk she cried:<br> "O fair my lord Bellerophon, abide<br> And hearken&#151;here my lady sendeth me,<br> And saith these words withal:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Philono&euml;,<br> Born of the Lycian King, Both give thee this<br> Fair blade, and prayeth for thee health and bliss;<br> Saying, moreover; as for this same sword,<br> Draw it not forth before base man or lord,<br> But be alone when first it leaves the sheath .<br> Yet since upon it lieth life and death,<br> Surely thou wilt not long delay to see<br> The face of that bright friend I give to thee</i>." <A NAME="page_252"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 252</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He felt the cold hilt meet his outstretched hand,<br> And she was gone, nor longer did he stand<br> Than but to look if any stood thereby,<br> Then gat him gone therefrom, and presently<br> Was lone within his chamber; there awhile<br> He stood regarding with a lovesome smile<br> The well-wrought sword, and fairly was it dight<br> With gold and gems; then by the taper's light<br> He drew it from the sheath, and, sooth to tell,<br> E&#146;en that he hoped for therewithal befel,<br> Because a letter lay &#146;twixt blade and sheath,<br> Which straight he opened, and nigh held his breath<br> For very eagerness, the while he read:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Short is the time, and yet enow, it said,<br> Nightfall it will be when thou readest this.<br> If thou wouldst live yet, for the weal and bliss<br> Of many, gird this sword to thee, and go<br> Down to the quay, and there walk to and fro,<br> Until a seafarer thou meetest there,<br> With two behind him who shall torches bear;<br> He shall behold the sword, and say to thee,<br> 'Is it drawn forth?' and say 'Yea, verily,<br> And the wound healed.' Then shall he bring thee straight<br> Unto his keel, which with loose sails doth wait<br> Thy coming, and shall give thee gold good store,<br> Nor bide the morn to leave the Lycian shore.&#151;<br> Farewell; I would have seen thee, but I feared&#151;<br> &#151;I feared two things; first, that we might be heard</i> <A NAME="page_253"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 253</FONT></A><br> <i>By green trees and by walls, and thus should I<br> Have brought the death on thee I bid thee fly;<br> The first&#151;but for the second, since I speak<br> Now for the last time&#151;Love has made me weak;<br> I feared my heart made base by sudden bliss<br> I feared&#151;wilt thou be wroth who readest this?&#151;<br> Mine eyes I saw in thine that other tide;<br> I thought perchance that here thou mightst abide,<br> Constrained by Love.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now if I have said ill,<br> Shall not my soul of sorrow have its fill?<br> I sin, but bitter death shall pay therefor</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He read the piteous letter o&#146;er and o&#146;er,<br> Till fell the tears thereon like sudden rain,<br> For he was young, and might not love again<br> With so much pleasure, such sweet bitterness,<br> Such hope amid that new-born sharp distress<br> Of longing; half-content to love and yearn,<br> Until perchance the fickle wheel might turn.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The well-kissed sword within his belt he set,<br> But ye may well deem was more minded yet<br> To bide his fortune in the Lycian land,<br> What fear soe&#146;er before his path might stand;<br> And great his soul grew, thinking of the tide<br> When every hindrance should be thrust aside,<br> And love should greet him; calm, as though the death,<br> He knew so nigh him, on some distant heath<br> Were sitting, flame-bound, waiting for the word <A NAME="page_254"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 254</FONT></A><br> Himself should give; with hand upon his sword,<br> Unto the hall he took his way: therein<br> Was growing great and greater joyful din,<br> For there they drank unto the coming day;<br> And as through all that crowd he made his way,<br> The shouts rose higher round him, and his name<br> Beat hard about the stony ears of Fame.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So then beside the Lycian King he sat<br> A little while, and spake of this and that,<br> E&#146;en as a man grown mighty; and at last<br> Some few words o&#146;er that feasting folk he cast,<br> Proud, mingling sharp rebuke with confidence.<br> And bade them feast no more, but going thence<br> Make ready straight to live or die like men.<br> And therewithal did he depart again<br> Amidst them, and for half the night he went<br> Hither and thither, on such things intent<br> As fit the snatcher-forth of victory;<br> And then, much wondering how such things could be,<br> That aught but love could move a man at all,<br> Into a dreamless slumber did he fall,<br> Wherefrom the trumpet roused him in the morn,<br> Almost before the summer sun was born;<br> And midst the new-born longings of his heart,<br> From that fair place now must he needs depart<br> Unguarded and unholpen to his fate.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought happed to him &#146;twixt palace-court and gate <A NAME="page_255"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 255</FONT></A><br> Of the fair city; thronged it was e&#146;en then<br> With anxious, weeping women and pale men,<br> But unto him all faces empty were<br> But one, that nowise might he now see there:<br> Or ere he passed the great gate back he gazed'<br> To where the palace its huge pile upraised<br> Unto the fresh and windy morning sky,<br> As seeking if he might e&#146;en now espy<br> That which he durst not raise his eyes unto<br> When &#146;neath its walls he went a while ago.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So through the gate the last man strode, and they<br> Who in the city seemed so great a stay<br> Unto that people, as the country-side<br> About their moving ranks spread bleak and wide,<br> Showed like a handful, and the town no less<br> Seemed given up to utter helplessness.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>SEVEN days of fear wore by; Philono&euml;<br> Must vex her heart with all that yet might be,<br> And oft would curse herself that she it was<br> Through whom such death as his should come to pass,<br> And weep to think of all her life made lone.<br> But on the eighth day, at the stroke of noon,<br> A little band of stained and battered men <A NAME="page_256"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 256</FONT></A><br> Passed through the gate into the town again,<br> And left glad hearts as well as anxious ones<br> Behind them, as they clattered o&#146;er the stones<br> Unto the palace: there the King they found<br> Set on his throne, with ancient lords around,<br> And cried to him, "O King, rejoice! at last<br> Raised is thy banner, that ill men had cast<br> Unto the ground; as safely mayst thou lie<br> Within the city of the Solymi<br> As in this house thou buildedst for thy bliss,<br> For all things there are thine now, e&#146;en as this."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the King rose, and filled a cup with wine,<br> And said, "All praise be unto things divine!<br> Yet ere I pour, how goes it with our folk?<br> Did many die before they laid the yoke<br> On these proud necks? when will they come again?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O King," they said, "though they fell not in vain,<br> Yet many fell; but now upon the way<br> Our fellows are: I think on the third day<br> They will be here, and needs must they be slow,<br> Because they have with them a goodly show;<br> Wains full of spoil, arms, and most fair attire,<br> Wrought gold that seven times o&#146;er has felt the fire;<br> And men and women of thy stubborn foes<br> E&#146;en as thou wilt their lives to keep or lose."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What sayst thou next about Bellerophon," <A NAME="page_257"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 257</FONT></A><br> The King said, "that this day for me hath won?<br> Is he alive yet?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the man waxed pale,<br> And said, "He liveth, and of small avail<br> Man's weapons are against him; on the wall<br> He stood alone, for backward did we fall<br> Before the fury of the Solymi,<br> Because we deemed ourselves brought there to die,,<br> And might not bear it: then it was as though<br> A clear bright light about his head did glow<br> Amidst the darts and clamour, and he turned<br> A face to us that with such glory burned<br> That those behind us drave us back again,<br> And cried aloud to die there in the pain<br> Rather than leave him, and with such a wave<br> Of desperate war swept up, they scarce could save<br> Their inmost citadel from us that tide,<br> Who at the first with mocks had bidden us bide<br> A little longer in a freeman's land,<br> Until their slaves had got their whips in hand<br> To drive us thence."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as he spake, at first<br> The King like one, who heareth of the worst,<br> And must not heed it, hearkened, but when he<br> Had heard his servant's tale out, suddenly<br> The wine he poured, and cried, "Jove, take thou this<br> In token of the greatness of our bliss,<br> In earnest of the gifts that thou shalt have,<br> Who thus our name, our noble friends didst save." <A NAME="page_258"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 258</FONT></A><br> So spake he, looking downward, and his heart<br> In what his lips said, had perchance, some part,<br> However, driven on by long-sworn oath,<br> He dealt in things that sore he needs must loathe:<br> And he who erst had told him of the thing<br> Seemed fain to linger, as if yet the King<br> Had something more to say; but no fresh word<br> He had for him, but with great man and lord<br> Made merry, praising wind and wave<br> That brought Bellerophon their fame to save.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But joyous was the town to hear of this,<br> For in that place, midst all that men call bliss,<br> Cold fear was mingled; such a little band<br> They seemed, but clinging to a barbarous land,<br> With strange things round about them; if the earth<br> Should open not to swallow up their mirth<br> And them together, they must deem it good;<br> Or if the kennels ran not with their blood,<br> While a poor remnant, driven forth with whips,<br> Must sit beneath the hatchways of strange ships,<br> Of such account as beasts. So there dwelt they,<br> Trembling amidst their wealth from day to day,<br> Afraid of god and man, and earth and sky.<br> Judge, therefore, if they thought not joyously<br> Of this one fallen amongst them, who could make<br> The rich man risk his life for honour's sake,<br> The trembling slave remember what he was,<br> The poor man hope for what might come to pass. <A NAME="page_259"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 259</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when the day carne when the gates were flung<br> Back on their hinges, and the people hung<br> About the pageant of their folk returned,<br> And many an eager face about him burned<br> With new and high desires they scarce could name,<br> He wondered how such glory on him came,<br> And why folk gazed upon him as a god,<br> And would have kissed the ground whereon he trod.<br> A little thing it seemed to him to fight<br> Against hard things, that he might see the light<br> A little longer and rejoice therein,<br> A little thing that he should strive to win<br> More time for love; and even therewithal<br> Into a dreamy musing did he fall<br> Amidst the shouts and glitter, and scarce knew<br> What things they were that he that day did do,<br> Only the time seemed long and long and long,<br> The noise and many men still seemed to wrong<br> The daintiness of his heart-piercing love,&#151;<br> As through a world of shadows did he move.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think then how fared his love Philono&euml;<br> Amid the din of that festivity!<br> For if while joy hung betwixt hope and fear<br> Life seemed a hateful thing to her and drear,<br> And all men hateful; if herself she cursed,<br> The hatefullest of all things and the worst;<br> If rest had grown a name for something gone<br> And not remembered; if herself alone <A NAME="page_260"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 260</FONT></A><br> Seemed no more one, but made of many things<br> All wretched and at strife; if sudden stings<br> Of fresh pain made her start up from her place,<br> And set to some strange unknown goal her face,<br> And she must stifle wails with bitterest pain&#151;<br> If all this was, ought she not now to gain<br> A little rest? now, when she heard the voice<br> Of triumph and the people's maddening noise<br> Round her returning love; still did she bear<br> Her grinding dread if with a wearier,<br> Yet with a calmer face, than now she bore<br> Desire so quickened by that fear past o&#146;er.<br> She in her garden wandered through the day,<br> And heavy seemed the hours to pass away.<br> Her colour came and went, she trembled when<br> She heard some louder shout of joyous men;<br> She could not hear the things her maidens spake,<br> Nor aught could she seem gracious for their sake;<br> The sweetest snatch of some familiar song<br> She might not hearken; she abode not long<br> Within the shadow; weary of the sun<br> She grew full soon; the glassy brook did run<br> In vain across her feet; the ice-cold well<br> Quenched not her thirst; the half-blown roses&#146; smell<br> Was not yet sweet enough: the sun sank low,<br> And then she murmured that the day must go<br> That should have been so happy: wearily<br> She laid her down that night, but nought slept she;<br> Yet in the morn the new sun seemed to bring <A NAME="page_261"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 261</FONT></A><br> A joy to her, and some unnamed dear thing<br> Better than rest or peace; for in her heart<br> She knew that he in all her thoughts had part;<br> Yea, and she thought how dreamlike he would ride<br> Amidst his glory, and how ill abide<br> The clamour of the feast; yea, and would not<br> That night to him belike be dull and hot,<br> And that dawn hopeful?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#146;Neath the wall there was<br> A place where dewy was the daisied grass<br> E&#146;en nigh the noon; a high tower great and round<br> Cast a long shadow o&#146;er that spot of ground,<br> And blind it was of window or of door,<br> For, wrought by long-dead men of ancient lore,<br> No part it was of that stone panoply<br> That girt the town; so lilies grew thereby,<br> And woodbine, and the odorous virgin's-bower<br> Hung in great heaps about that undyked tower,<br> And lone and silent was the pleasance there.<br> Thither Love led Philono&euml; the fair,<br> And well she knew of him, and still her heart<br> At every little sound and sight would start,<br> And still her palms were tingling for the touch<br> Of other hands, and ever over-much<br> Her feet seemed light.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the bushes gleamed<br> With something more than the low sun that streamed<br> Athwart their blossoms, and a clear voice rung<br> Above the ousel's; then with terror stung, <A NAME="page_262"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 262</FONT></A><br> She leaned her slim and perfect daintiness<br> &#145;Gainst the grey tower, and even like distress<br> Her great joy seemed. Green clad he was that morn,<br> And to his side there hung a glittering horn,<br> A mighty unbent bow was in his hand,<br> And o&#146;er his shoulders did the feathers stand<br> Of his long arrows; in his gleaming eyes<br> Such joy there was as he beheld the prize,<br> That in that shadow now he seemed to be<br> A piece of sunlight fallen down suddenly.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So face to yearning face they stood awhile,<br> And every word at first seemed poor and vile,<br> None better than another; nor durst they<br> Lips upon lips or palm to fingers lay,<br> More than if many people stood around,<br> With such strange fear and shame doth love abound.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last she spake: "Thou comest, then, to say<br> How thou wilt now be wise and go away,<br> E&#146;en as I bade; the prey has &#146;scaped the net;<br> Be wise, the fowler other wiles hath yet!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea," said he, "then thy word it was indeed<br> That needs must think about me in my need:<br> Strange, then, that now thou biddest me begone!<br> Belike thou know&#146;st not of folk left alone,<br> And what life grows to them: yet art thou kind&#151;<br> Thou deemest other friends I yet may find. <A NAME="page_263"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 263</FONT></A><br> Alas, life goeth fast; not every day<br> Do we behold folk standing in the way<br> With outstretched hands to meet us."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah," she said,<br> "How sweet thou art! Wand yet the dead are dead,<br> The absent are but dead a little while.<br> Then get thee gone from midst of wrong and guile,<br> And we shall meet once more in happier days,<br> When death lurks not amidst of rosy ways&#151;<br> &#151;Ah, wilt thou slay me, then?&#151;I knew not erst<br> How poor a life I had, and how accurst,<br> Before I felt thy lips&#151;what thing is this<br> That makes me faint amidst of new-born bliss?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rest in mine arms, O well-beloved," said he;<br> "I faint not, neither shall death come on me<br> While thus thou art: nay, nay, I think if I,<br> Hacked with an hundred swords, should come to lie,<br> Yet without thee I should not then depart."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O love, alas! the sorer is my heart<br> The more I love," she said, "we are alone;<br> Our loving life is not for any one<br> But for our own selves&#151;ah, deem all I said<br> Before those lips of thine on mine were laid<br> As said again and yet again! Some hate<br> Is round thee here, some undeserved strange fate<br> Awaits thee here in Lycia&#151;yea, full sure<br> The hungry swords here may we twain endure; <A NAME="page_264"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 264</FONT></A><br> But what then?&#151;Of the dead what hast thou heard<br> That maketh thee so rash and unafeared?<br> Can the dead love, or is there any space<br> In their long sleep when they lay face to face<br> Soft as we do now? can their pale lips plead<br> The pleas of love? or can their fixed eyes lead<br> Heart unto heart? or hast thou heard that they<br> Can wait from weary day to weary day,<br> And hope, as I will, while thou gatherest fame?<br> Can they have pleasure there e&#146;en in a name,<br> A memory? is their pain a pleasure there,<br> Are tears sweet, and the longing sobs that wear<br> The hours away, where life and hope are gone?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How can I any longer be alone?<br> Can I forget thee now? the while I live?<br> O my beloved, must I strive and strive,<br> And move thee not? How sweet thou art to me!<br> How dull the coming day that knows not thee!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fear not," he said; "not yet my days are done!<br> When on the deadly wall I stood alone,<br> And back the traitors fell from me, I felt<br> As though within me such a life there dwelt<br> As scarce could end&#151;Lo now, if I depart<br> I lack the safeguard of thy faithful heart,<br> And meet new dangers that thou know&#146;st not of.<br> Yea, listen, nor rebuke me&#151;This our love;<br> Hast thou not heard how love may grow a-cold<br> Before the lips that called thereon wax old? <A NAME="page_265"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 265</FONT></A><br> Ah, listen! seas betwixt us, and great pain,<br> And death of days that shall not be again;<br> And yearning life within us, and desire<br> That changes hearts as fire will quench the fire.<br> These are the engines of the Gods, lest we,<br> Through constant love, Gods too should come to be.<br> A little pain, a little fond regret,<br> A little shame, and we are living yet,<br> While love that should out-live us lieth dead&#151;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, my beloved, lift that glorious head<br> And look upon me! put away the thought<br> Of time and death, and let all things be nought<br> But this love of to-day! and think of me<br> As if for ever I should seem to thee<br> As I am now&#151;I will not go away,<br> Nor sow my love, to reap some coming day<br> I know not what: be merry, we shall live<br> To see our love high o&#146;er all danger thrive."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now she wept, but, starting midst her tears,<br> She stopped and listened like a bird that hears<br> A danger on the wind: the round tower's shade<br> A lesser patch upon the daisies made,<br> And all about the place &#146;gan folk to stir:<br> She turned and girt her loosened gown to her,<br> And with one sob, and a long faithful look,<br> The gathering tears from out her eyes she shook,<br> Nor bade farewell, but swiftly gat her gone. <A NAME="page_266"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 266</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he beneath the tower so left alone<br> Stooped down and kissed her foot-prints in the grass,<br> And then with swift steps through the place did pass,<br> Thinking high things; nor knew he till that hour<br> How sweet life was, or love its fruit and flower.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So passed the days, nor often might it be<br> That such sweet hours as this the twain might see;<br> And they must watch that folk might not surprise<br> Their hearts' love through the windows of their eyes<br> When midst of folk they met: but glorious days<br> Were for Bellerophon, and love and praise<br> From all folk, though the great end lingered yet<br> When he sweet life, or glorious death, should get.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW on a day was held of most and least<br> Unto Diana sacrifice and feast,<br> And on that tide the market empty was,<br> And through the haven might no dromund pass;<br> And then the wont was they should bear about<br> The goddess wrought in gold, with song and shout<br> And winding of great horns, amidst a band<br> Of bare-kneed maidens, bended bow in hand<br> And quiver at the back; and these should take,<br> As if by force, and for the city's sake, <A NAME="page_267"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 267</FONT></A><br> Three damsels chosen by lot for that same end,<br> And bind their hands, and with them straightly wend<br> Unto the temple of Diana; there<br> The priest should lead them to the altar fair<br> And midst old songs should raise aloft the knife<br> As if to take from each her well-loved life;<br> Therewith the King, with a great company,<br> Through the great door would come and respite cry,<br> And offer ransom: a great golden horn,<br> A silver image of a flowering thorn,<br> Three white harts with their antlers gilt with gold,<br> A silk gown for a huntress, every fold<br> Thick wrought with gold and gems; then to and fro<br> An ancient song was sung, to bid men know<br> That of such things the goddess had no need;<br> Yet in the end the maidens all were freed,<br> The harts slain in their place, the dainty things<br> Hung o&#146;er the altar from fair silver rings,<br> And then, midst semblance of festivity<br> And joyful songs, the solemn day went by.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this they told Bellerophon, and said<br> Moreover, that the white-foot well-girt Maid<br> These gifts must have, because a merry rout<br> Of feasters, knowing neither fear nor doubt,<br> With love and riot did her grove defile<br> In the old days; and therefore nought more vile<br> Than three fair maids&#146; lives would she have at first,<br> And with that burden was the city cursed <A NAME="page_268"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 268</FONT></A><br> For many years; "But in these latter days,<br> She to whom we to-morrow give great praise,<br> Will take these signs of our humility,<br> And let the folk in other wise go free."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on the morn joyful the city was,<br> Nor did men look for aught to come to pass<br> More than in other years; but lo, a change!<br> For there betid great portents dire and strange.<br> For first, when in the car of cedar-wood,<br> Decked with green boughs, the golden goddess stood,<br> And the white oxen strained at yoke and trace,<br> In no wise might they move her from the place,<br> Though they had drawn well twenty times that weight.<br> So when the priests had come in all their state<br> To pray her, and no lighter she would grow,<br> They said she did it for that folk might know<br> She fain would have a shrine built o&#146;er the way,<br> And that all rites should there be wrought that day.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So was it done, and now all things seemed well<br> A little space, and nought there was to tell<br> Until the King had brought the ransom due,<br> And the loosed bonds men from the maidens drew;<br> Then fell the third maid down before the King,<br> And cried from foaming mouth a shameful thing<br> Unmeet for maids; then from the frightened folk<br> That filled the street a clamour there outbroke,<br> And some cried out to slay the woman there,<br> And some to burn her wanton body fair, <A NAME="page_269"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 269</FONT></A><br> And some to cast her forth into the sea<br> And purge the town of that iniquity.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the King had bidden lead her forth,<br> And try if she indeed were one of worth,<br> Or if her maidenhood were nought and vain,<br> The tossing street grew somewhat stilled again,<br> And o&#146;er the sinking tumult called a priest:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Abide, let see if she will take the beast<br> E&#146;en as her wont is! but if so it be<br> That of our old crime she has memory<br> And threatens us with something strange and new,<br> Yet mid your fear do all in order due,<br> Nor make two faults of one, that ye may bear<br> A double punishment from year to year."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then were the harts brought forth; the first one stood<br> Fearless as he were lonely in the wood,<br> While to his throat drew nigh the sharp-edged knife,<br> Nor did the second strive to keep his life;<br> But when the third and biggest drew anigh,<br> He tossed his gilded antlers angrily<br> And smote his foot against the marble floor,<br> While from his throat came forth a low hoarse roar;<br> And as the girl whose office was to smite<br> His drawn-back throat came forth confused and white,<br> And raised a wavering hand aloft, then he<br> His branching horns from the priests&#146; hands shook free,<br> And as the affrighted girl fell back, turned round, <A NAME="page_270"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 270</FONT></A><br> And gathered up his limbs for one last bound;<br> But even therewith a soldier from the band<br> That stood about the King raised up his hand,<br> And in the beast's heart thrust his well-steeled spear,<br> And as he smote, like one who knew no fear,<br> He cried aloud:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O foolish Artemis,<br> Men's ways thou knowest not, putting from thee this,<br> The gift once offered! think no more of us<br> That we will pray with eyes all piteous<br> Before thee, or give gifts from trembling hands;<br> But get thee gone straightway to other lands,<br> Where folk will yet abide thee&#151;for we know<br> How long a way it is for thee to go<br> From heaven to earth, how far thine arms will reach,<br> And no more now thy good-will do beseech!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stooped, and from the beast his weapon drew,<br> Then turned and passed his fear-struck fellows through,<br> Or ere the swords from out the scabbards came;<br> And so folk say, that no man knew his name<br> Or whence he was.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But from the concourse broke<br> In pale and murmuring knots the frightened folk;<br> And if the priests had heart yet for a word<br> Of comfort, neither so had they been heard;<br> But they slunk off too, more perchance afraid<br> Because they were the nigher to the Maid. <A NAME="page_271"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 271</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now had the morn begun with cloud and sun;<br> But, little heeded there of any one<br> Mid that beginning of fear's agony,<br> Slowly the clouds were swallowing up the sky;<br> So ere the sun had wholly sunk in them,<br> Great drops fell slowly from a black cloud's hem<br> Amid that troubled folk, who felt as though<br> They from that place of terror needs must go,<br> Yet, going, scarce could feel their unnerved feet;<br> Then gleamed a lightning-flash adown the street,<br> The clattering thunder, made ten times more loud,<br> Because of dread, hushed all the murmuring crowd,<br> And brought a many trembling to their knees,<br> And some set off a-running toward the quays,<br> That they might go they knew not where or why;<br> But therewithal such rain fell from the sky,<br> As though some river of the upper world<br> Had burst his banks, the furious south-wind hurled<br> The folk's wet raiment upward as it tore<br> Along the ground, and the white rain-spray bore<br> Seaward along: yet so it came to pass<br> That no more terror from the sky there was;<br> The wind grew steady, but from roof of grey<br> Fast fell the rain upon the ruined day,<br> Till trembling still, and shivering with the cold,<br> Home went all folk, and soon the Maid of gold<br> Stood lonely in the rain-beat way and drear,<br> Amid drenched cloths and garlands, once made fair<br> To make the day more joyous.&#151;You had thought <A NAME="page_272"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 272</FONT></A><br> That now already had the Maiden brought<br> Upon the city all the dreaded ill,<br> So lifeless was it grown and lone and still.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now to tell of Prince Bellerophon;<br> Upon that day so chanced it he had gone<br> Unto the hills, in chase the hours to spend<br> Until the tide of feasting should have end;<br> For since he was an alien in that place,<br> Beside the King he might not show his face<br> Unto the goddess; so that morn he stood<br> Upon a hill's top that from out a wood<br> Rose bare; thence looking east, he saw the sky<br> Grow black and blacker as the rain drew nigh,<br> And deemed it good to go, but, as he turned,<br> Afar a jagged streak of lightning burned,<br> Paling the sunshine that the dark woods lit,<br> And rocks about him; through his mind did flit<br> Something like fear thereat; and still he gazed<br> Out to the east, but not again there blazed<br> That fire from out the sky. Now was he come<br> To such a place, that thence fair field, and home<br> Of toiling men, and wood, and broad bright stream<br> Lay down below, and many a thing did gleam<br> Beneath the zenith's brightness, brighter yet<br> For horror of the far clouds&#146; stormful threat,<br> And clear the air was with the coming rain&#151;<br> So then as he would turn his head again,<br> Out in the far horizon like a spark <A NAME="page_273"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 273</FONT></A><br> Some flame broke out against the storm-clouds dark,<br> And seemed to grow beneath his eyes; he stood,<br> And, gazing, saw across the day's dark mood<br> Another and another, nigh the first;<br> Then, as the distant thunder's threatening cursed<br> The country-side, and trembling beast and man,<br> The spark-like three flames into one thread ran,<br> That shot aloft amidst, yet further spread<br> At either end; and to himself he said:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, is it so? what tidings then draw near?<br> In warlike lands soon should I look to hear<br> Of armies marching on through war and wrack;<br> Good will it be in haste to get me back<br> Unto the foolish folk that trust in me."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then did he mount and ride off hastily<br> Adown the slopes; but not so fast withal<br> But that upon him did the full storm fall<br> In no long time; and so through pelting rain<br> And howling wind he reached the gate again;<br> And so unto the palace went, to hear<br> From pale lips tales of all that day of fear;<br> And when about those bale-fires seen afar<br> He spake, and bade make ready for some war,<br> Folk listened coldly; for they thought to see<br> Some strange, portentous sign of misery<br> Set in the heavens upon the morrow morn,<br> And the old tale of war seemed well outworn. <A NAME="page_274"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 274</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet ere the night beyond its midst was worn,<br> Another tale unto their ears was borne<br> That cast into their hearts the ancient fear,<br> And the Gods&#146; threatening easier seemed to bear<br> Than this that fell on them.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dead of night<br> The grey clouds drew apart, the moon shone bright<br> Over a dripping world; and some folk slept<br> Wearied by fear, if some their tired limbs kept<br> Ready for flight; then clattering horse-hooves came<br> To the east gate, and one called out the name<br> Of him who had the guard; so said the man<br> That forth he went into the moonlight wan,<br> And saw nought but the tall black-shadowed trees<br> Waving their dripping boughs in the light breeze,<br> So went back scared. But in a while again<br> The galloping of horse did he hear plain,<br> But he and his sat fast and spake no word,<br> And scarce fhr fear might they hold spear or sword.<br> Nigher the sound came, till it reached the gate;<br> Then as the warders did abide their fate,<br> Thinking to see the gates burst open wide,<br> And death in some strange shape betwixt them ride,<br> The gates were smitten on with hasty blows,<br> And breathless cries of wild entreaty rose<br> Up through the night:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Open, O open, ye<br> Who sit in peace, and let in misery!<br> Do ye not see the red sky at our backs? <A NAME="page_275"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 275</FONT></A><br> And how the earth all quiet places lacks,<br> And shakes beneath the myriad hooves of steel?<br> Open, ah open, as ye hope for weal!<br> For ships lie at your quays with sails all bent<br> And oars made ready&#151;Open, we are spent!<br> Do ye not hear them? Open, Lycian men!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With staring eyes still sat the warders when<br> That cry they heard, and knew not what should be;<br> And the great gates of oak, clenched mightily<br> With iron end-long and athwart, seemed fair<br> Unto their eyes; but as they cowered there<br> A clash of steel again their dull ears heard<br> That came from out the town, and more afeard<br> They grew, if it might be; then torches came<br> Into the place of guard, and mid their flame<br> A shining one in arms, with wrathful eyes<br> &#146;Neath his bright helm, who cried:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why in this guise<br> Sit ye, O Lycians? Get each to his home!<br> For know that yesterday three keels did come<br> Laden with spindles and all women's gear,<br> And none need lack e&#146;en such a garment here<br> As well befits him&#151;lutes the Gods have sent,<br> And combs and golden pins, to that intent<br> That ye may all be merry&#151;what say I?<br> Ye may be turned to women verily,<br> Because the Gods are wise, and thriftless deed<br> Mislikes them, and forsooth is little need <A NAME="page_276"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 276</FONT></A><br> That thews and muscles go with suchlike hearts<br> As ye have, while all wise and manly parts<br> Are played by girls, weak-handed, soft, and white.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get to the tower-top, look ye through the night,<br> And ye shall see the cleared sky made all red<br> And murky &#146;neath the moon with signs of dread;<br> Come forth and meet them! What! the Gods ye fear,<br> And what they threaten? Life to you is dear?<br> Ah, fools, that think not how to all on earth<br> The very death is born along with birth;<br> That some men are but dying twenty years,<br> That some men on this sick-bed of all tears<br> Must lie for forty years, for eighty some,<br> Or ever they may reach their peaceful home!<br> Ah, give to birth the name of death, and wait<br> With brave hearts rather for the stroke of fate,<br> And hope, since ye gained death when ye were born,<br> That ye from death by dying may be torn&#151;<br> &#151;Unless ye deem that if this day ye live,<br> The next a deathless life to you will give.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come, then! these few behind me may ye see<br> Who think it worse to live on wretchedly<br> Than cast the die amidst of noble strife<br> For honoured death or fearless glorious life&#151;<br> &#151;Yea, yea! and is the foe upon us then?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For even as he spake they heard again <A NAME="page_277"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 277</FONT></A><br> The smiting on the door, and as the sword<br> Leapt from the exile's sheath with his last word,<br> Again the cry, made dim by the thick door,<br> Smote on their ears:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lycians, are ye no more<br> Within your guarded town? A voice we heard<br> As if of one who bade us not be feared&#151;<br> He was a god belike, and no more men<br> Dwell in your town: ah, will ye open then?<br> Do ye not hear that noise upon the wind,<br> And do ye think that ye fair days shall find<br> If our red blood shall stain your ancient gate?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as if these were maddened by some fate,<br> Down rained the blows upon the unyielding oak,<br> And the scared guards shrank back behind the folk<br> Bellerophon brought with him; therewith he<br> Sheathed his bright blade, and shot back mightily<br> The weight of iron bolt, and therewithal<br> Stepped aside swiftly; back the gates did fall<br> Upon their hinges, and a wretched throng<br> Stood, horse and foot, the glimmering spears among,<br> Cowering and breathless, and with eyes that turned<br> Over their shoulders, as though still they yearned<br> To see no more the quiet moonlit way<br> Beyond the open gates. But now, when they<br> Were ordered somewhat, and the gates again<br> Shut fast, Bellerophon cried out:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O men, <A NAME="page_278"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 278</FONT></A><br> Full fast ye fled, meseems! and who were these,<br> That made you tremble at the wet-leaved trees<br> And quivering acres of the bearded rye?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then spake an old man: "Fair sir, manfully<br> Thou speakest, and thy words are full of hope;<br> And yet with these no power thou hast to cope,<br> Who for each rye-head raise a spear aloft<br> Who know as much of fear, or pity soft,<br> As do the elm-trees; whom the Gods drive on<br> Until the world once happy they have won<br> And made it desert, peopled by the ghosts<br> Of those who happy died before their hosts;<br> Or else lived on in fear and misery<br> A little while before God let them die&#151;<br> Devils are these; but what scorn shall we get<br> When thou hast heard that these are women!&#151;yet<br> Keep thou thy scorn till thou art face to face<br> With these a minute ere the fearful chase."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud laughed Bellerophon, and said, "See ye,<br> O tremblers, what foreknowledge was in me,<br> When I said e&#146;en now ye should change your parts<br> With women! Throw the gates wide, fearful hearts,<br> And let us out, that with a word or two<br> All that is needed herein we may do!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man said, "Laugh, then, while yet your eyes<br> Are still unblasted with the miseries <A NAME="page_279"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 279</FONT></A><br> These days have brought on us!&#151;Lo, if I tell<br> Half of the dreadful things that there befell,<br> Ye will not listen,&#151;if I tell the shape<br> Of these fell monsters, for whom hell doth gape,<br> Still will ye say that but my fear it is,<br> That speaketh in me,&#151;yea, but hearken this;<br> For certainly such foes are on you now<br> As, bound together by a dreadful vow,<br> Will slay yourselves, and wives, and little ones,<br> And build them temples with the blanched bones,<br> Unto the nameless One who gives them force."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then cried Bellerophon, in wrath: "To horse!<br> To horse, O Lycians! Ere the moon is down<br> The dawn shall come to light us; in the town<br> Bide thou, O captain, and guard gate and wall;<br> And leave us to what hap from Fate may fall!<br> We are enow&#151;and for these cowards-here,<br> Let them have yet another death to fear<br> Unless they rule their tongues. Tell thou the King<br> That, when I come again, full many a thing<br> These lips will have to tell him; and meanwhile,<br> Since often will the Gods make strong the vile,<br> And bring adown the great, let him have care<br> That this his city is left nowise bare<br> Of men, and food, and arms. More might I say,<br> But now methinks the night's face looks towards day.<br> The moon sinks fast; so get we speedily<br> Unto that redness in the eastern sky, <A NAME="page_280"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 280</FONT></A><br> That at the dawn with smoke shall dim the sun.'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shout rose when his last clear word was done,<br> And at his back went rolling down the way<br> Mingled with clash of arms, for, sooth to say,<br> Hard had he laboured ere the dark night fell,<br> And thus had gathered men who loved him well,<br> Stout hearts to whom more fair it seemed to be<br> The face of death in stricken field to see<br> Than in that place to bide, till Artemis<br> Had utterly consumed all hope of bliss<br> With some unknown, unheard-of shape of fear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now his well-shod steed they brought him there;<br> Once more from out its sheath he drew his sword,<br> The gates swung backward at his shouted word,<br> And forth with eager eyes into the waves<br> Of darkness did he ride; the spears and glaives<br> Moved like a tossing winter grove behind<br> As on he led them, fame or death to find;<br> And grey night made the world seem over wide,<br> And over empty, in the darkling tide,<br> Betwixt the moonset and the dawn of day.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then rose the sun; the fear that last night lay<br> Upon that people changed to certain fear<br> Well understood, of death that drew anear;<br> And now no more the timorous kept their eyes<br> Turned unto earth, lest in the sky should rise <A NAME="page_281"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 281</FONT></A><br> The dreadful tokens of a changing world;<br> No more they thought to see strange things down-hurled<br> By Gods as unlike their vain images<br> As unto men are hell's flame-branched trees.<br> Last night for any war or pestilence,<br> Glad had they been to change that crushing sense<br> Of helplessness and lies; but now this morn,<br> Tormented by the rumour newly born,<br> The vague fear seemed the lightest; the Gods&#146; hands<br> Less cruel than the deeds of those fell bands.&#151;<br> Uprooted vines, fields trampled into mire,<br> The ring of spears around the stead afire,<br> Steel or the flame for choice; the torture hour<br> When time is gone, and the flesh hath no power<br> But to give agony on agony<br> Unto the soul that will not let it die,<br> So strong it is&#151;the lone despair; the shame<br> Of a lost country and dishonoured name;<br> These last but little things to bear indeed,<br> When e&#146;en the greatest helps not in our need,<br> And o&#146;er the earth is risen furious hell.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, when this terror on the city fell,<br> At first went thronging to the clamorous quays<br> Rich men, with whatso things their palaces<br> Could give, that strong-backed slaves of theirs might bear.<br> And to and fro the great lords wandered there,<br> Making hard bargains &#146;neath the shipmen's grin, <A NAME="page_282"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 282</FONT></A><br> Who had good will a life of ease to win<br> With one last voyage; here and there indeed,<br> Among the heaps of silver and rich weed<br> Piled on the deck, the hard-hand mariners<br> Thrust rudely &#146;gainst the wondering infant heirs,<br> And delicate white slaves, and proud-eyed wives,<br> And grumbled as they wrought to save their lives.<br> And here and there a ship was moving out<br> With white sails spreading amid oath and shout,<br> While her sweeps smote the water heavily,<br> And on the prow stood, yearning for the sea<br> And other lands beyond, some trembling lord.<br> But presently thereof the King had word;<br> And when he knew that thus the matter went,<br> A trusty captain to the quays he sent,<br> And stout men armed, who lined the water-side.<br> So there perforce must every man abide,<br> For shut and guarded now was every gate.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if, amid the fear of coming fate,<br> You ask how fared the sweet Philono&euml;,<br> With mind a shrinking tortured thing to see,<br> How shall you wonder! Tales of dread she heard<br> With scornful eyes, and chid with eager word<br> Her timorous women; and with bright flushed face<br> And glittering eyes, she went from place to place,<br> As though foreknowledge of the joy to come<br> Pierced through all grief. Of those that saw her, some<br> Would say, "Alas! this ill day makes her mad." <A NAME="page_283"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 283</FONT></A><br> And some, "A message certes hath she had<br> From the other world, and is foredoomed to die."<br> But some would gaze upon her wrathfully,<br> While sitting with bent head on woe intent,<br> They watched her fluttering raiment as she went<br> Her daily ways as in fair time of peace.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did the longest of all days decrease<br> Through hours of straining fear; full were the ways<br> With homeless country folk, with &#146;wildered gaze<br> Fixed on the eager townsmen questioning;<br> And carts with this or that poor homely thing,<br> And cumbered women worn and desolate,<br> Blocked up the road anigh the eastern gate.<br> Thronged with pale faces were the walls that day<br> Of folk so scared they could not go away,<br> But still must watch until the horror came,<br> Or watch at least that smoke above the flame<br> Till sundown lit the sky with dreadful light;<br> And still the tales of horror and affright<br> Grew greater, and the cumbered city still<br> Weighed down with wealth could summon up no will<br> To fight or flee, or with closed lips to wait<br> Amidst her gold the evil day of fate.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night came at last, a night of all unrest:<br> Upon the armed men now the people pressed<br> At gate and quay, until they needs must yield,<br> And many a bark o&#146;erladen slowly reeled<br> Beneath the moonlight o&#146;er the harbour green; <A NAME="page_284"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 284</FONT></A><br> While as the breathing of the night wind keen<br> Sang down the creek, great sounds of fear it bore,<br> And redder was the sky than heretofore.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fearful night, when some at last must think<br> That they of no more horror now might drink<br> Than they had drank; wherefore, with stress of fear<br> Made brave, some men must catch up shield and spear,<br> And leaderless go forth unto the flame<br> All eyes were turned to; but when daylight came,<br> With its grey light came naked death again,<br> And honourless did all things seem and vain<br> That man might do; the gates were left ajar,<br> And through the streets helpless in weed of war<br> The warders went: nought worth the King was made,<br> When by each man the truth of all was weighed,<br> And all seemed wanting: help there was in none.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet when &#146;mid these things nigh the day was done,<br> And the foe came not, once more hope was born<br> Within men's hearts too wearied and outworn<br> To gather fresh fear; then the walls seemed good,<br> The great gates more than iron and oaken wood,<br> And with returning hope there came back shame;<br> And they, bethinking them of their old name,<br> &#146;Gan deem that spear to spear was no ill play,<br> What wrath of goddesses soever lay<br> Upon the city; and withal indeed,<br> There came fresh rumours to their honour's need, <A NAME="page_285"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 285</FONT></A><br> And they bethought them of the godlike one<br> Who in their midst so great a deed had done,<br> And who erewhile rode forth so carelessly<br> Their very terror with his eyes to see.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So at the sunset into ordered bands<br> Once more the men were gathered; women's hands<br> Bore stones up to the ramparts that no more<br> That crowd of pale and anxious faces bore,<br> But helms and spear-heads; and the King came forth<br> Amidst his lords, and now of greater worth<br> Than common folk he seemed once more to be.<br> And in some order, if still timorously<br> The Lycians waited through the night; the sky<br> Showed lesser tokens of the foe anigh,<br> So still hope grew.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dawn of day the King<br> Bade folk unto Diana's image bring<br> Things precious and burnt-offerings; and the smoke<br> Curled o&#146;er the bowed heads of the praying folk<br> There in the streets, and though nought came to pass<br> To tell that well appeased the goddess was,<br> And though they durst not strive to move her thence,<br> Yet did there fall on men a growing sense<br> That now the worst was over: and at noon,<br> Just as the King amid the trumpets&#146; tune<br> Went to his house, a messenger pierced through<br> The wondering crowd, and toward Jobates drew,<br> Nor did him reverence, nor spake aught before<br> He gave unto the King the scroll he bore. <A NAME="page_286"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 286</FONT></A><br> Then from his saddle heavily down-leapt,<br> Stiffened, as one who not for long has slept,<br> While the King read the scroll; then those anigh<br> Amid the expectant silence heard him cry,<br> "Praise to the Gods, who are not angry long!<br> Hearken, all ye, how they have quenched our wrong.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Good health and good-hap to the Lycian King<br> And all his folk, and every wished-for thing<br> Wisheth hereby Bellerophon, and saith:<br> From out the valley of the shade of death<br> Late am I come again to make you glad,<br> Because no evil journey have we had.<br> And now the land is cleansed of such a pest<br> As has not been before; be glad and rest,<br> And look to see us back in seven days&#146; space,<br> For yet awhile must we abide to chase<br> The remnant of the women that ye feared</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence a moment followed that last word,<br> Then such a joyous shout, as good it is<br> That those can know not who still dwell in bliss;<br> Then turning here and there, with varied noise<br> The people through all places did rejoice,<br> Till pleasure failed for weariness; but still<br> Did old and young, and men and women fill<br> The temples with their praises; till, when earth<br> Had fallen into twilight mid their mirth, <A NAME="page_287"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 287</FONT></A><br> With prayers and hymns they brought the great-eyed, white,<br> Slow-going oxen through the gathering night,<br> And yoked them to Diana's car again;<br> Nor this time were they yoked thereto in vain,<br> Down went the horned heads, beam and axle-tree<br> Creaked as they drew, and folk cried out to see<br> The wheels go round; heart opened unto heart<br> With unhoped joy, and hate was set apart,<br> Envy and malice waited for some day<br> More common, as the goddess took her way<br> Amid the torch-lit, flower-strewn, joyous street,<br> Unto the house made ready for her feet.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But mid the noise of great festivity<br> That filled the night, slept on Philono&euml;,<br> Amid that sea of love past hope and fear,<br> And woke at sunrise no more sound to hear<br> Than singing of the birds in thick-leaved trees<br> Ere yet the sun might silence them; like these<br> Did she rejoice, nor strange to her it was<br> That all these things her love should bring to pass.<br> Rising, she said, "To-day thou workest this,<br> And unto many givest life and bliss;<br> To-morrow comes: therewith perchance for me<br> A time when thou my faithful heart mayst see."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she alone her fair attire did on,<br> And mid the sleepers went her way alone<br> Into the garden, and from flower to flower <A NAME="page_288"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 288</FONT></A><br> Passed, making sweeter even that sweet hour;<br> And as by soft folds of her fluttering gown<br> Her body's fairness was both hid and shown,<br> E&#146;en so in simpleness her soul indeed<br> Lay, not drawn back, but veiled beneath the weed<br> Of earthly beauty that the Gods had lent<br> Till they through years should work out their intent.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O&#146;er the freed city passed the time away,<br> Until it drew unto the promised day<br> Of their return who all that peace had won.<br> And now the loved name of Bellerophon<br> Rang ever in the maiden's ears; and she,<br> As in the middle of a dream, did see<br> The city made all ready for that hour,<br> When in a fair-hung townward-looking bower,<br> Pale now, amid her maidens she was set,<br> New pain of longing for her heart to get.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some dream there was of hurrying messengers<br> Bright with a glory that was nowise theirs,<br> And strains of music bearing back again<br> The heart to vague years long since lived in vain;<br> Then still a moving dream&#151;of robes of gold,<br> Armour unsullied by the bloody mold<br> That bought this peace; a dream of noble maid<br> And longing youth in snowy robes arrayed;<br> Of tinkling harps and twinkling jewelled hands,<br> And gold-shod feet to meet the war-worn bands, <A NAME="page_289"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 289</FONT></A><br> That few and weary, flower-crowned, made the dream<br> Less real amid the dainty people seem&#151;<br> A wild dream of strange weapons heaped on wains,<br> And rude wrought raiment vile with rents and stains,<br> And dream-like figures by the axle-trees&#151;<br> &#151;Women or beasts? and in the hands of these<br> Trumpets of wood, and conch-shells, and withal<br> Clamour of blast and horrid rallying call,<br> And such a storm of strange discordant cries,<br> As stilled the townsfolk mid their braveries,<br> For therewith came the prisoners of the fight.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dreadful dream!&#151;with blood-stained hair and white,<br> Clad in most strange habiliment of war,<br> Sat an old woman on a brazen car;<br> White stared her eyes from a brown puckered face<br> Upon the longed-for dainties of that place,<br> But wrath and fear no more in them were left,<br> For death seemed creeping on her; an axe-heft<br> Her chained hands held yet; and a monstrous crown,<br> Of heavy gold, &#146;twixt her thin feet and brown<br> Was laid as she had cast it off in fight,<br> When she was fain amidst her hurried flight<br> To hide all signs of her fell royalty.<br> An unreal dream&#151;about her seemed to be,<br> Figures of women, clad in warlike guise,<br> In scales of brass, beasts&#146; skins, and cloths of dyes,<br> Uncouth and coarse, made vile with earth and blood. <A NAME="page_290"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 290</FONT></A><br> A dream of horror! nought that men deem good<br> Was seen in them, were they or young or old:<br> Great-limbed were some and mighty to behold,<br> With long black hair and beast-like brows, and low;<br> Bald-headed, old, and wizened did some go,<br> Yet all adorned with gold; this, in rich gown<br> Of some slain woman, went with eyes cast down;<br> That yelling walked, with armour scantly clad,<br> And at her belt a Lycian's head yet had<br> Hung by the flaxen hair; this old and bent<br> From bushy eyebrows grey, strange glances sent,<br> Grinning as from their limbs the people shrank;<br> But most the cup of pain and terror drank,<br> That they had given to drink so oft ere now<br> If any sign thereof their eyes might show,<br> And whatso mercy they of men might have,<br> No hope for them their gross hearts now did save.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dreadful dream! Philono&euml;'s slim hands<br> Shut from her eyes the sight of those strange bands;<br> Yet dreamlike must her heart behold them still,<br> Amid new thoughts of God, and good and ill,<br> And her eyes filled with tears. But what was this<br> That smote her yearning heart with sudden bliss,<br> Yet left it yearning? her fair head she raised,<br> And with wide eyes down on the street she gazed,<br> Yet cried not out; though all cry had been drowned<br> Amid those joyous shouts, as, laurel-crowned,<br> And sword in hand, and in his battered gear <A NAME="page_291"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 291</FONT></A><br> On his black horse he came, and raised to her<br> Eyes that her heart knew. Nay, she moved not aught,<br> Nor reached her arms abroad, as he was brought<br> Beneath her place, too soon to go away;<br> And open still her hands before her lay<br> As down the street passed on the joyous cries,<br> Nor were there any tears in her soft eyes;<br> Only her lips moved softly, as she cast<br> One look upon the people going past,<br> Struggling and slow behind the last bright spears,<br> Whose steady points had so thrust back their fears.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But amid silence &#146;neath the eyes of men,<br> Another time that day they met again;<br> And that was at the feast in the great hall,<br> For thither must the King's folk, one and all,<br> Women as men, give welcome unto him<br> Through whom they throve. Belike all things grew dim<br> Before the hero's eyes but her alone,<br> Belike a strange light in the maid's eyes shone,<br> Made bright with pain; but yet hand met not hand,<br> Though each to each so close the twain must stand,<br> And though the hall was hushed to hear her say<br> Words that she heeded not of that fair day.<br> But when her clear and tender speech had end,<br> And mouths of men a mighty shout did send<br> Betwixt the pillars, still her lips did move,<br> As though they two were lone, with words of love <A NAME="page_292"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 292</FONT></A><br> Unheard, but felt by him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So passed the day,<br> And other days and nights fell fast away;<br> But now when this great trouble had gone by,<br> And things again seemed no more now to lie<br> Within his mighty hands, she &#146;gan to fear<br> Her father's wiles again; the days grew drear,<br> The nights too long, nor might she see his face,<br> Nor might they speak in any lonely place;<br> And hope at whiles waxed dim, and whiles she saw<br> The fate her heart so dreaded on them draw,<br> While she must sit aside with folded hands,<br> While for her sake he shunned the peaceful lands.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the while there must at last be borne<br> That darkest hour that brings about the morn.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>NOW as the days passed, to his treasury<br> Would the King go, King Pr&#156;tus&#146; gift to see,<br> And stand with knitted brows to gaze on it,<br> While many thoughts about his heart would flit.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on a day he said, "Time yet there is<br> To slay the man who saved our life and bliss.<br> Once did I cast him unto death, and he<br> Must win nought thence but utter victory;<br> And when the Gods helped me with ruin and fear <A NAME="page_293"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 293</FONT></A><br> Another time, yet that brought nowise near<br> The end this binds me to; yet once again<br> Shall it be tried before I call it vain,<br> And strive no more, but bear the punishment<br> That on oath-breakers and weak fools is sent."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then gat he to the doom-hall of the town,<br> And midst his lords and wise men sat him down<br> And judged the people; if at whiles to him<br> The clamour of the jarring folk waxed dim<br> Amid the thoughts of his own life that rose<br> Within him and about his heart did close,<br> Yet none the less a great King there he seemed;<br> As of a god's his heart the people deemed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in good peace and joy the summer wore,<br> Nor did folk mind how it was told of yore<br> That in the days to come great dangers three,<br> Within the bounds of Lycia should there be;<br> For fear of ill was grown an empty name.<br> Into fair autumn slipped the summer's flame<br> More fruitful than its wont, and barn and garth<br> Ran over with the good things of the earth.<br> Crowded the quays were, but no merchandise,<br> No bale of fair-wrought cloth or odorous spice,<br> Bore pestilence within it at that tide;<br> In peace and health the folk dwelt far and wide.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the way's dust easier now was seen <A NAME="page_294"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 294</FONT></A><br> Upon the bordering grape-bunches, whose green<br> Was passing slow through red to heavy black,<br> And the ploughed land all standing crop did lack,<br> Though yet the share the fallow troubled not;<br> Now, when the nights were cool, and noons still hot,<br> And in the windless woods the acorn fell,<br> More tidings were there of that land to tell.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For on a day as in the doom-hall sat<br> Jobates, and gave word on this and that,<br> A clamour by the outer door he heard<br> Of new-come folk, mixed with the answering word<br> Of those his guards, who at the door did stand;<br> So when his say was said, he gave command<br> To bring in one of those about the door;<br> Then was a country carle brought forth before<br> The ivory seat, and scared he seemed to be;<br> And sodden was his face for misery,<br> As on the King he stared with open eyes.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What wilt thou?" said Jobates. "What thing lies<br> Upon thee that my power can take away?<br> For in mine house the Gods are good to-day."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice did the man's lips open as to speak,<br> But no sound came; the third time did outbreak<br> A husky, trembling sound from them, but nought<br> To tell the wondering folk what thing he sought. <A NAME="page_295"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 295</FONT></A><br> Then said the King, "The man is mazed with fear;<br> Go ye and bring him wine; we needs must hear<br> What new thing now has happed beneath the sun.<br> Take heart! for thou art safe!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So was it done:<br> The man raised up the bowl with trembling hand,<br> And drank, and then a while he yet did stand<br> Silent amid the silence; then began<br> In a weak voice:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A poor and toiling man<br> I am indeed; therefore a little thing,<br> My woe may seem to thee; yet note, O King,<br> That the world changes; unimagined ill<br> Is born therein, and shall grow greater still.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In early summer I was well enow<br> Among such men as still have need to sow<br> Before they reap, to reap before they eat,<br> Nor did I think too much of any threat<br> Time had for me; but therewith came the tide<br> When those fell women harried far and wide;<br> I saved myself, my wife, and little ones,<br> And with nought else lay on this city's stones<br> Until peace came; then went I to the west<br> Where dwelt my brother in good peace and rest,<br> And there the four of us must eat our bread<br> From hands that grudged not mayhap, with small dread<br> And plenteous toil. A vineyard hath he there,<br> Whose blossoming in March was full and fair,<br> And May's frost touched it not, and July's hail <A NAME="page_296"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 296</FONT></A><br> Against its bunches green might not prevail;<br> Up a fair hill it stretched; exceeding good<br> Its sunny south-turned slopes are; a thin wood<br> Of oak-trees crowns the hill indeed, wherein<br> Do harbour beasts most fain a feast to win<br> At hands of us and Bacchus; but a wall<br> Well built of stones guardeth the garth from all<br> On three sides, and at bottom of the hill<br> A full stream runs, that dealeth with a mill,<br> My brother's too, whose floury duskiness<br> Our hungry souls with many a hope did bless;<br> Within the mill-head there the perch feed fat,<br> And on the other side are meadows flat,<br> And fruitful; shorn now, and the rooting swine<br> Beneath the hedge-row oak-trees grunt and whine,<br> And close within the long grass lies the quail,<br> While circling overhead the kite doth sail,<br> And long the partridge hath forgot the mowers.<br> A close of pot-herbs and of garland flowers<br> Goes up the hill-side from the green-banked stream,<br> And a house built of clay and oaken beam<br> Stands at its upper end, whose hillward side<br> Is midst the vines, that half its beams do hide.&#151;<br> &#151;Nay, King, I wander not, I mind me well<br> The tale from end to end I have to tell,<br> Have patience!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fair that house was yesterday,<br> When lusty youth and slim light-handed may<br> Were gathered from the hamlets thereabout; <A NAME="page_297"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 297</FONT></A><br> From the stream-side came laughing scream and shout,<br> As up the bank the nets our maidens drew,<br> And o&#146;er their bare feet washed with morning dew<br> Floundered the cold fish; for grape-gathering tide<br> It was that morn, and folk from far and wide<br> Came to our help, and we must feast them there,<br> And give them all we had of good and fair.<br> "King, do I babble? thou for all thy crown<br> And robes of gold hadst gladly sat thee down<br> At the long table &#146;neath the apple-trees-<br> And now&#151;go find the bones of one of these,<br> And be called wise henceforth!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The last guest came,<br> The last shout died away that hailed his name,<br> The ring of men about the homestead door<br> Began to move; the damsels hung no more<br> Over the fish-tubs, but their arms shook dry<br> And shod their feet, and came up daintily<br> To mingle with the girls new-come thereto,<br> And take their baskets and the edge-tools due;<br> The good wife from the white well-scalded press<br> Brushed off the last wasp; while her mate did bless<br> The Gods, and Bacchus chiefly, as he poured<br> Upon the threshold ancient wine long stored<br> Under the earth; and then broke forth the song<br> As to the vineyard gate we moved along.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hearken, O King! call me not mad, or say<br> Some evil god-sent dream upon me lay;<br> Else could I tell thee thus how all things fell?&#151; <A NAME="page_298"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 298</FONT></A><br> Nay, speak not, or the end I may not tell.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea, am I safe here? will he hear of it<br> And come to fetch me, even if I sit<br> Deep underground, deep underneath the sea,<br> In places thou hast built for misery<br> Of those that hate thee; yet for safeguard now<br> Of me perchance?

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said the man: "How much may now avail<br> Thy power and walls I know not, for I thought<br> Upon the wind a certain noise was brought&#151;<br> But now I hear it not, and I will speak<br> What said I?&#151;From all mouths there did outbreak<br> A plaintive song made in the olden time,<br> Long sung by men of the wine-bearing clime;<br> Not long it was, and ere the end was o&#146;er<br> In midst the laden vine-rows did we pour,<br> And fell to work as glad as if we played;<br> And merrier grew the laugh of man and maid<br> As the thin baskets filled upon that morn; <A NAME="page_299"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 299</FONT></A><br> And how should fear or thought of death be born<br> In such a concourse!

The sweet autumn air<br> With a faint sickening vapour now was filled,<br> And all sounds else but that sound were clean stilled,<br> Yea, even the voice of folk by death afeard,<br> That in the void that horror might be heard,<br> And nought be heeded else.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hearken, O King,<br> The while I try to tell thee of the thing<br> What like it was&#151;well, lionlike, say I?<br> Yea, as to one who sees the teeth draw nigh<br> His own neck&#151;like a horror of the wood,<br> Goatlike, as unto him who in drear mood<br> Sees monsters of the night bemock his love,<br> And cannot hide his eyes or turn to move&#151;<br> Or serpent-like, e&#146;en as to such an one<br> A serpent is, who floating all alone<br> In some untroubled sea all void and dim<br> Beholds the hoary-headed sea-worm swim,<br> Circling about him, ere he rise to strike&#151;<br> Nay, rather, say the world hath not its like&#151;<br> A changer of man's life, a swallowing dread,<br> A curse made manifest in devil-head.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Long lay I there, meseems; no thought I had<br> Either of death, or yet of being made glad <A NAME="page_301"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 301</FONT></A><br> In time to come, for all had turned to pain,<br> Nor might I think of aught to call a gain&#151;<br> Right wondrous is the life of man, O King!<br> So strong to bear so many a fearful thing,<br> So weak of will&#151;See now, I live, who lay<br> How long I know not, on that wretched day,<br> As helpless as a dead man, but for this,<br> That pain still grew with memory of what bliss<br> Passed life had been to me; until, God wot,<br> So was I helped, that memory now was not,<br> And all was blank.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, once more did I wake,<br> Empty at first, till stirred the sickening ache<br> Of that great fear; then softly did I rise,<br> And gazed about the garth with half-dead eyes,<br> A heart whence everything but fear was gone."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped a while and hung his head adown,<br> As if remembering somewhat; then he drew<br> Nigher the King, and said: "This thing is true,<br> Though thou believe it not&#151;that I was glad<br> Within the hour that yet my life I had,<br> Though this I saw&#151;the garth made waste and bare,<br> Burnt as with fire, and for the homestead fair<br> The last flames dying o&#146;er an ash-heap grey&#151;<br> Gone was the mill, the freed stream took its way<br> In unchecked shallows o&#146;er a sandy bed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I knew not if my kin were slain or fled,<br> Yet was I glad awhile that nought was there <A NAME="page_302"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 302</FONT></A><br> But me alone, till sense and dread &#146;gan stir<br> Within my heart; then slowly I began<br> To move about, and saw no child of man&#151;<br> Unless maybe those ash-heaps here and there<br> I durst not go anigh, my fellows were.<br> Could I but flee away now! down I gat<br> Unto the stream, yet on the bank I sat<br> A long while yet, bewildered; till at last<br> I gathered heart, and through the stream ran fast,<br> And on and on, and cried, '<i>Are all men gone?<br> Is there none left on earth but I alone,<br> And have I nought to tell my tale unto?</i>'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So did I run, until at last I knew<br> That among men I was, who, full of fear,<br> Were striving somewhat of the words to hear<br> My heart spake, but my lips would utter not;<br> And food and drink from them perchance I got,<br> Perchance at last I told the story there;<br> I know not, but I know I felt the air<br> And seemed to move&#151;they must have brought me then<br> To thee, O King&#151;but these are not the men,<br> These round about&#151;there is no more to say.<br> Meseems I cannot sleep or go away,<br> Yet am I weary."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly came from him<br> The last words, and his eyes, all glazed and dim,<br> Began to close; he tottered, and at last <A NAME="page_303"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 303</FONT></A><br> Sank on the ground, and into deep sleep passed,<br> Nor might men rouse him; so they bore him thence,<br> Till death should reach him or returning sense.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So next of those who brought him thereunto<br> Was question made what of those things they knew;<br> Who answered e&#146;en as for their fear they might;<br> For some had seen a fire the late-past night,<br> And some the morn before a yellow smoke;<br> And one had heard the cries of burning folk;<br> And one had seen a man stark naked fly<br> Adown the stream-side, and as he went by<br> Saw that he bled, and thought that on his flesh<br> Were dreadful marks, that were as done afresh<br> By branding irons. One, too, said he saw<br> A dreadful serpent by the moonlight draw<br> His dry folds o&#146;er the summer-parched way<br> Unto a pool that &#146;neath the hill-side lay.<br> And men there were who said that they had heard<br> The sound of lions roaring, and, afeard,<br> Had watched all-armed, with barred doors, through the night.<br> Then as men's faces paled with sore affright,<br> Unto the doom-hall came more folk, and more,<br> And tales of such-like things they still told o&#146;er,<br> Of fresh deaths and of burnings, and still nought<br> They had to tell of what this fear had wrought.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now ye shall know that Prince Bellerophon <A NAME="page_304"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 304</FONT></A><br> In a swift ship had sailed a while agone<br> &#146;Gainst a Tyrrhenian water-thief, who then<br> Wrought great scathe on the peaceful merchantmen<br> That sought those waters; so the King sent forth<br> Another captain that he held of worth,<br> And eighty men with him in company,<br> Well armed, the truth of all these things to see.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At sunset from the town did they depart,<br> And none among them seemed to lack good heart,<br> And wise they were in war; but ere the sun<br> Through all the hours of the next day had run,<br> One ancient brave man only of the band<br> Came back again, no weapon in his hand,<br> No shield upon his neck&#151;but carrying now<br> His son's dead body on his saddle-bow,<br> A lad of eighteen winters, fair and strong;<br> But when men asked what thing had wrought that wrong,<br> Nought might he answer, but with bowed-down head<br> Still sat beside the armed body dead,<br> As one who had no memory; but when folk<br> Searched the youth's body for the deadly stroke,<br> No wound at all might they find anywhere;<br> So still the old man sat with hopeless stare,<br> And though he seemed right hale and sound of limb,<br> And ate and drank what things were brought to him,<br> Yet speechless did he live for three more days,<br> Then to the silent land he went his ways. <A NAME="page_305"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 305</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now a great terror on the city fell,<br> Even as that whereof we had to tell<br> In the past summer; day by day there came<br> Folk fleeing to the gates, who thought no shame<br> To tell how dreams had scared them, or some sign<br> In earth, or sky, or milk, or bread, or wine,<br> Or in some beast late given unto a god;<br> And on the beaten ways once more there trod<br> The feet of homeless folk; the country-side<br> Grew waste and bare of men-folk far and wide;<br> And whatso arm&egrave;d men the King did send,<br> But little space upon their way did wend<br> Ere they turned back in terror; nigher drew<br> The belt of desolation, yet none knew<br> What thing of ill it was that wrought this woe,<br> More than the man who first the tale did show.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile men's eyes unto the sea were turned<br> Watching, until the Sea-hawk's image burned<br> Upon the prow Bellerophon that bore,<br> And his folk cast the hawser to the shore,<br> And long it seemed to them did he delay.<br> Yet since all things have end, upon a day<br> The Sea-hawk's great sweeps beat the water green,<br> And her long pennon down the wind was seen,<br> As nigh the noontide toward the quays she passed,<br> With sound of horns and singing; on the mast<br> Hung the sea-robbers' fair shields, lip to lip,<br> And high above the clamour of the ship, <A NAME="page_306"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 306</FONT></A><br> Out from the topmast, a great pennoned spear<br> The terror of the seas aloft did bear,<br> The head of him who made the chapmen quake.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New hope did that triumphant music wake<br> Within men's hearts, as now with joyous shout<br> The bay-crowned shipmen shot the gangway out<br> Unto the shore, and once more as a god<br> The wise Bellerophon among them trod,<br> As to the Father's house he took his way,<br> The tenth of all the spoil therein to lay.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he came into the greatest square<br> Where was the temple, a great throng was there,<br> And on the high steps of the doom-hall's door,<br> A clear-voiced, gold-clad herald stood, before<br> A row of spears; and now he cried aloud,<br> Over the raised heads of the listening crowd:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hearken, O Lycians! King Jobates saith;<br> <i>Upon us lies the shadow of a death<br> I may not deal with; old now am I grown,<br> And at the best am but one man alone;<br> But since such men there are, as yet may hope<br> With this vague unseen death of man to cope,<br> He whereby such a happy end is wrought<br> Shall nowise labour utterly for nought<br> As at my hands; lest to the gods we seem<br> To hold too fast to wealth, lest all men deem<br> We are base-born and vile: so know hereby</i>, <A NAME="page_307"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 307</FONT></A><br> <i>That to the man who ends this woe will I<br> Give my fair daughter named Philono&euml;,<br> And this land's rule and wealth to share with me.<br> And if it be so that he may not take<br> The maiden, let him give her for my sake<br> To whom he will; or if that may not be,<br> A noble ransom shall he have of me<br> And be content.&#151;May the gods save us yet,<br> And in fair peace these fears may we forget!</i>"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ended, and the folk about the place,<br> Seeing the shipmen come, on these did gaze,<br> And in their eyes were mingled hope and doubt;<br> But at the last the shadow of a shout<br> They raised for Prince Bellerophon; and he<br> Stood at the door one moment silently,<br> And wondered; for he knew nought of the things<br> That there had fallen while the robber-kings<br> He chased o&#146;er ridge and furrow of the sea;<br> Because folk deemed ill-omened it would be<br> To tell thereof ere all things due were paid<br> Unto the Father, and the fair tenth laid<br> Before his altar. Yet he could not fail<br> To see that in some wise the folk must ail;<br> Such haggard eyes, such feverish faces were<br> About him; yea, the clamour and the cheer<br> That greeted him were eager with the pain<br> Of men who needs must hope yet once again<br> Before they fall into the jaws of death. <A NAME="page_308"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 308</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So as the herald spake, he held his breath,<br> His heart beat fast, and in his eyes there burned<br> The light of coming triumph, as he turned<br> Unto a street that led from out the place,<br> And up the steep way saw the changeless grace<br> Of the King's palace, and the sun thereon,<br> That calmly o&#146;er its walls of marble shone,<br> For all the feverish fears of men who die:<br> One moment thus he stood, and smiled, then high<br> Lifted his sword, and led the spear-wood through<br> The temple-door and toward the altar drew.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>BUT when all rites to Jove were duly done,<br> Unto the King went up Bellerophon,<br> To tell him of his fare upon the sea;<br> So in the chamber named of porphyry<br> He found Jobates pacing to and fro,<br> As on the day when first he bade him go<br> And win the Solymi.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O King," he said,<br> "All hail to thee! the water-thief is dead,<br> His keel makes sport for children of the sea."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And I, Bellerophon, have news for thee,<br> And see thou to it! The gods love so well <A NAME="page_309"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 309</FONT></A><br> The fair wide world, that fear and death and hell<br> In this small land will they shut up for aye.<br> And thou&#151;when thou hadst luck to get away,<br> Why must thou needs come back here, to abide<br> In very hell? I say the world is wide,<br> And thou art young; far better had it been,<br> When o&#146;er the sea-thief's bulwarks first were seen<br> Men's wrathful eyes, the war-shout to have stayed;<br> Then might ye twain, strong in each other's aid,<br> Have won some fair town and good peace therein:<br> For here with us stout heart but death shall win."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on a table nigh the King's right hand<br> Bellerophon beheld a casket stand<br> That well he knew; thereby a letter lay,<br> Whose face he had not seen before that day,<br> And as he noted it a half-smile came<br> Across his face, for a look like to shame<br> Was in the King's eyes as they met his own.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheerly he spake: "O King, I have been thrown<br> Into thine hands, and with this city fair<br> Both weal and woe have I good will to share.<br> Young am I certes, yet have ever heard<br> That whether men live careless or afeard<br> Death reaches them; of endless heaven and hell<br> Strange stories oft have I heard people tell;<br> Yet knew I no man yet that knows the road<br> Which leadeth either to the blest abode <A NAME="page_310"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 310</FONT></A><br> Or to the land of pain. Not overmuch<br> I fear or hope the gates of these to touch&#151;<br> Unless we twain be such men verily<br> As on the earth make heaven and hell to be;<br> And if these countries are upon the earth,<br> Then death shall end the land of heaven and mirth,<br> And death shall end the land of hell and pain.<br> Yea, and say all these tales be not in vain,<br> Within mine hand do I hold hope&#151;within<br> This gold-wrought scabbard&#151;such a life to win<br> As will not let hope fall off utterly,<br> Until such time is come that I must die<br> And no more need it. But the time goes fast;<br> Into mine ears a tale the townsmen cast<br> With eager words, almost before my feet<br> The common earth without Jove's fane could meet;<br> I heard thy herald too say mighty things&#151;<br> How sayest thou about the oaths of kings?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King's eyes glistened: "O Corinthian,"<br> He said, "if there be such a twice-cursed man<br> As rules the foolish folk and punisheth,<br> And yet must breathe out lies with every breath,<br> Let him be thrice cursed, let the Gods make nought<br> Of all his prayers when he in need is caught!"<br> "What sayest thou," then said Bellerophon,<br> "If a man sweareth first to such an one,<br> And then to such another, and the twain <A NAME="page_311"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 311</FONT></A><br> Cannot be kept, but one still maketh vain<br> The other?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the King cast down his eyes:<br> "What sayest thou, my son? What mysteries<br> Lie in these words of thine? Go forth and break<br> This chain of ours, and then return to take<br> Thy due reward&#151;oft meseems so it is<br> That these our woes are forged to make thy bliss."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then laughed Bellerophon aloud, and said,<br> "The Gods are kind to mortals, by my head!<br> But so much do they love me certainly<br> That more than once I shall not have to die;<br> And I myself do love myself so well<br> That each night still a pleasant tale shall tell<br> Of the bright morn to come to me. But thou,<br> Think of thy first vow and thy second vow!<br> For so it is that I may come again<br> Despite of all: and what wilt thou do then?<br> Ponder meanwhile if from ill deeds can come<br> Good hap to bless thee and thy kingly home!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even with that last word was he gone,<br> And the King, left bewildered and alone,<br> Sat down, and strove to think, and said at last:<br> "Good were it if the next three months were passed;<br> I should be merrier, nigher though I were<br> Unto that end of all that all men fear." <A NAME="page_312"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 312</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then sent he for his captain of the guard,<br> And said to him, "Now must thou e&#146;en keep ward<br> Closer than heretofore upon the gates,<br> Because we know not now what thing awaits<br> The city, and Bellerophon will go<br> The truth of all these wondrous things to know:<br> So let none pass unquestioned; nay, bring here<br> Whatever man bears tales of woe or fear<br> Into the city; fain would I know all&#151;<br> Nay, speak, what thinkest thou is like to fall?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Belike," the man said, "he will come again,<br> And with my ancient master o&#146;er us reign;<br> E&#146;en as I came in did he pass me by,<br> And nowise seemed he one about to die."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay," said the King, "thou speak&#146;st but of a man;<br> Shall he prevail o&#146;er what made corpses wan<br> Of many a stout war-hardened company?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Methinks, O King, that such might even be,"<br> The captain said; "he is not of our blood;<br> He goes to meet the beast in other mood<br> Than has been seen among us, nor know I<br> Whether to name him mere man that shall die,<br> Or half a god; for death he feareth not,<br> Yet in his heart desire of life is hot;<br> Life he scorns not, yet will his laughter rise <A NAME="page_313"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 313</FONT></A><br> At hearkening to our timorous miseries,<br> And all the self-wrought woes of restless men."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah," said the King, "belike thou lov&#146;st him then?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, for I fear him, King," the captain said,<br> "And easier should I live if he were dead;<br> Besides, it seems to me our woes began<br> When down our streets first passed this godlike man,<br> And all our fears are puppets unto him;<br> That he may brighter show by our being dim,<br> The Gods have wrought them as it seems to me."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What wouldst thou do then that the man might be<br> A glorious memory to the Lycian folk,<br> A god who from their shoulders raised a yoke<br> Dreadful to bear; then, as he came, so went,<br> When he had fully wrought out his intent?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, King, what say&#146;st thou? Hast thou then forgot<br> Whereto he goes this eve? Nay, hear&#146;st thou not<br> His horse-hooves&#146; ring e&#146;en now upon the street?<br> Look out! look out! thine eyes his eyes shall meet,<br> And see the sun upon his armour bright!<br> Yet the gold sunset brings about the night,<br> And the red dawn is quenched in dull grey rain."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then swiftly did the King a window gain,<br> And down below beheld Bellerophon, <A NAME="page_314"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 314</FONT></A><br> And certes round about his head there shone<br> A glory from the west. Then the King cried:<br> "O great Corinthian, happy mayst thou ride,<br> And bring us back our peace!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hero turned,<br> And through his gold hair still the sunset burned,<br> But half his shaded face was grey. He stayed<br> His eager horse, and round his mouth there played<br> A strange smile as he gazed up at the King,<br> And his bright hauberk tinkled ring by ring.<br> But as the King shrank back before his gaze,<br> With his left hand his great sword did he raise<br> A little way, then back into the sheath<br> He dropped it clattering, and cried:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Life or death,<br> But never death in life for me, O King!"<br> Therewith he turned once more; with sooty wing<br> The shrill swifts down the street before him swept,<br> And from a doorway a tired wanderer leapt<br> Up to his feet, with wondering look to gaze<br> Upon that golden hope of better days.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then back the King turned; silent for awhile<br> He sat beneath his captain's curious smile,<br> Thinking o&#146;er all the years gone by in vain.<br> At last he said:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea, certes, I were fain<br> If I my life and honour so might save<br> That he not half alone, but all should have." <A NAME="page_315"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 315</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea," said the captain, "good the game were then,<br> For thou shouldst be the least of outcast men;<br> So talk no more of honour; what say I,&#151;<br> Thou shouldst be slain in short time certainly,<br> Who hast been nigh a god before to-day!<br> Be merry, for much lieth in the way<br> &#146;Twixt him and life: and, to unsay the word<br> I said before, be not too much afeard<br> That he will come again. The Gods belike<br> Have no great will such things as us to strike,<br> But will grow weary of afflicting us;<br> Because with bowed heads, and eyes piteous,<br> We take their strokes. When thou sitt&#146;st down to hear<br> A minstrel's tale, with nothing great or dear<br> Wouldst thou reward him, if he thought it well<br> Of wretched folk and mean a tale to tell;<br> But when the godlike man is midst the swords<br> He cannot &#146;scape; or when the bitter words,<br> That chide the Gods who made the world and life,<br> Fall from the wise man worsted in the strife;<br> Or when some fairest one whose fervent love<br> Seems strong the world from out its curse to move,<br> Sits with cold breast and empty hands before<br> The hollow dreams that play about death's door&#151;<br> When these things pierce thine ears, how art thou moved!<br> Though in such wise thou lov&#146;st not nor art loved,<br> Though with weak heart thou lettest day wear day<br> As bough rubs bough; though on thy feeble way <A NAME="page_316"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 316</FONT></A><br> Thou hast no eye to see what things are great,<br> What things are small, that by the hand of fate<br> Are laid before thee. Shall we marvel then,<br> If the Gods, like in other things to men,<br> (For so we deem them) think no scorn to sit<br> To see the play, and weep and laugh at it,<br> And will not have poor hearts and bodies vile<br> With unmelodious sorrow to beguile<br> The long&nbsp;long days of heaven&#151;but these, in peace,<br> Trouble or joy, or waxing, or decrease,<br> Shall have no heed from them&#151;ah, well am I<br> To be amongst them! never will I cry<br> Unto the Gods to set me high aloft;<br> For earth beneath my feet is sweet and soft,<br> And, falling, scarce I fall.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Behold, O King,<br> Beasts weep not ever, and a short-lived thing<br> Their fear is, and their generations go<br> Untold-of past; and I who dwell alow,<br> Somewhat with them I feel, and deem nought ill<br> That my few days with more of joy may fill;<br> Therefore swift rede I take with all things here,<br> And short, if sharp, is all my woe and fear.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now happier were I if Bellerophon,<br> This god on earth, from out our land were gone,<br> And well I hope he will not soon return<br> Who knows? but if for some cause thou dost yearn<br> For quiet life without him, such am I<br> As, risking great things for great things, would try <A NAME="page_317"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 317</FONT></A><br> To deal with him, if back again he comes<br> To make a new world of our peaceful homes.<br> Yet, King, it might well be that I should ask<br> Some earthly joy to pay me for the task;<br> And if Bellerophon returns again<br> And lives, with thee he presently will reign,<br> And soon alone in thy place will he sit;<br> Yea, even, and if he hath no will for it.<br> His share I ask then, yet am not so bold<br> As yet to hope within mine arms to fold<br> Philono&euml; thy daughter, any more<br> Than her, who on the green Sicilian shore<br> Plucked flowers, and dreamed no whit of such a mate<br> As holds the keys of life, and death, and fate&#151;<br> &#151;Though that indeed I may ask, as in time,<br> The royal bed's air seem no outland clime<br> To me, whose sire, a rugged mountaineer,<br> Knew what the winter meant, and pinching cheer."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the twinkling crafty eyes of him<br> The King looked long, until his own waxed dim<br> For thinking, and unto himself he said:<br> "To such as fear is trouble ever dead,<br> How oft soe&#146;er the troublous man we slay?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last he spake aloud: "Quick fails the day;<br> These things are ill to speak of in the night;<br> Now let me rest, but with to-morrow's light<br> Come thou to me, and take my word for all." <A NAME="page_318"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 318</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mask of reverence he had erst let fall<br> The Captain brought again across his face,<br> And smiling left the lone King in his place.<br> Who when all day had gone, sat hearkening how<br> Without, his gathering serving-men spake low,<br> And through the door-chinks saw the tapers gleam.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now while thus they talked, and yet the stream<br> Of golden sunsetting lit up the world,<br> Ere yet the swift her long dusk wings had furled<br> In the grey cranny, fair Philono&euml; went<br> Amid her maids with face to earth down-bent<br> Across the palace-yard, oppressed with thought<br> Of what those latter days to her had brought;<br> Daring, unlike a maid's sweet tranquil mind,<br> And hushed surprise, so strange a world to find<br> Within her and around her: life once dear,<br> Despised yet clung to; fear and scorn of fear;<br> A pain she might not strive to cast away,<br> Lest in the heart of it all life's joy lay;<br> Joy now and ever. Toward the door she came<br> Of the great hall; the sunset burned like flame<br> Behind her back, and going ponderingly<br> She noted her grey shadow slim to see<br> Rise up and darken the bright marble wall;<br> Then slower on the grass her feet did fall<br> Till scarce she moved; then from within she heard<br> A voice well loved cry out some hurried word.<br> She raised her face, and in the door she seemed <A NAME="page_319"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 319</FONT></A><br> To see a star new fallen, therefrom there gleamed<br> Such splendour, but although her dazzled eyes<br> Saw nought, her heart, fulfilled of glad surprise,<br> Knew that his face was nigh ere she beheld<br> The noble brow as wise as grief-taught eld,<br> As fair as a god's early unstained youth.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while they stood thus, with new ruth<br> Gathering in either's heart for the other's pain,<br> And fear of days yet to be passed in vain,<br> And wonder at the death they knew so nigh<br> And disbelief in parting, should they die,<br> And joy that still they stood together thus.<br> Then, in a voice that love made piteous<br> Through common words and few, she spake and said:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What dost thou, Prince, with helmet on thine head<br> And sword girt to thee, this fair autumn eve?<br> Is it not yet a day too soon to leave<br> The place thou tamest to this very noon?"<br> He said, "No Lycian man can have too soon<br> His armour on his back in this our need,<br> Yea, steel perchance shall come to be meet weed<br> For such as thou art, lady. Who knows whence<br> We next may hear tales of this pestilence?<br> Fair is this house: yet maybe, or today<br> The autumn evening wind has borne away<br> From its smooth chambers sound of woe and tears, <A NAME="page_320"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 320</FONT></A><br> And shall do yet again. Death slayeth fears,<br> Now I go seek if Death too slayeth love."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little toward him did one slim hand move,<br> Then fell again mid folds of her fair gown;<br> She spake:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farewell, a great man art thou grown;<br> Thou know&#146;st not fear or lies; so fare thou forth:<br> If the Gods keep not what is most of worth<br> Here in the world, its memory bides behind;<br> And we perchance in other days may find<br> The end of hollow dreams we once have dreamed,<br> Waking from which such hopeless anguish seemed."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale was her face when these words were begun,<br> But she flushed red or ere the end was done<br> With more than sunset. But he spake and said:<br> "Farewell, farewell, God grant thee hardihead,<br> And growing pleasure on from day to day!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then toward the open gate he took his way,<br> Nor looked aback, nor yet long did she turn<br> Her eyes on him, though sore her heart did yearn<br> To have some little earthly bliss of love<br> Before the end.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But right and left did move<br> Her damsels as he passed them, e&#146;en as trees<br> Move one by one when the light fickle breeze <A NAME="page_321"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 321</FONT></A><br> Touches their tops in going toward the sea;<br> And their eyes turned upon him wonderingly<br> That such a man could live, such deeds be done;<br> But now his steed's hooves smote upon the stone,<br> He swung into his saddle, and once more<br> Cast round a swift glance at the great hall door<br> And saw her not; alone she stood within,<br> Striving to think what hope of things to win<br> Had left her life; her maidens' prattling speech<br> Within the porch her wildered ears did reach,<br> But not the hard hooves' clatter as he rode<br> Along the white wall of that fair abode,<br> Nor yet the shout that he cast back again<br> Unto the King; dark grew each window-pane,<br> She seemed to think her maids were talking there,<br> She doubted that some answer came from her;<br> She knew she moved thence, that a glare of light<br> Smote on her eyes, that old things came in sight<br> She knew full well; that on her bed she lay,<br> And through long hours was waiting for the day;<br> But knew not what she thought of; life seemed gone,<br> And she had fought with Gods, and they had won. <A NAME="page_322"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 322</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>NEXT morn, the captain, as it was to be,<br> Held speech with King Jobates privily.<br> And when he came from out the royal place<br> A smile of triumph was there on his face,<br> As though the game were won; but as he went<br> Unto the great gate on his luck intent,<br> A woeful sound there smote upon his ear,<br> And crossed his happy mood with sudden fear;<br> For now five women went adown the street,<br> That e&#146;en the curious townsmen durst not meet,<br> Though they turned round to look with wild scared eyes,<br> And listened trembling to those doleful cries;<br> Because for Pallas&#146; sacred maids they knew<br> Those wild-eyed wailing ones that closer drew<br> Scant rags about them, as with feet that bled<br> And failing limbs they tottered blind with dread,<br> Past house and hall. Now such-like had been these,<br> And guarded as the precious images<br> That hold a city's safety in their hands,<br> And dainty things from many distant lands<br> Were gathered round them in the house that stood,<br> Fair above all, within the hallowed wood,<br> Ten leagues from out the city; wondrous lore,<br> Folk deemed, within that house they pondered o&#146;er,<br> And had been goddesses, but that they too<br> The hope of death if not its terror knew. <A NAME="page_323"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 323</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White grew the captain's face these folk to see,<br> Yet midst his fear he muttered: "Well be ye,<br> O Gods, who have no care to guard your own!<br> Perchance ye too weary of good are grown;<br> Look then on me, I shall not weary you&#151;<br> I who once longed great things and high to do<br> If ye would have it so;&#151;come, bless me then,<br> Since ye are grown aweary of good men!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to his folk he turned, and bade them take<br> The holy women for the goddess&#146; sake,<br> And give them into some kind matron's care.<br> So did they, and when bathed and clad they were,<br> He strove in vain to know their tale; for they<br> Had clean forgot all things before that day,<br> And only knew that they by some great curse<br> Had late been smitten, and mid fear of worse<br> Were leaving life behind. So when he knew<br> That with these woful women he might do<br> Nought else, because their hearts were dead before<br> Their bodies, midst the fear and tumult sore<br> He went unto the gate, and waited there<br> If he perchance some other news might hear;<br> But nought befell that day to tell about,<br> And tidingless night came, and dark died out.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But just before the rising of the sun<br> The gate was smitten on, and there sat one<br> On a grey horse, and in bright armour clad.<br> Young was he, and strong built; his face seemed glad <A NAME="page_324"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 324</FONT></A><br> Amidst of weariness, and though he seemed<br> Even as one who of past marvels dreamed.<br> Now turned the captain to him hastily,<br> And said: "Fair fellow, needs thou must with me,<br> Nor speak thou good or bad before the King<br> Has heard thee;" therewith, scarcely wondering,<br> He rode beside the captain, and the twain<br> In no long time the palace gate did gain,<br> Which opened at a word the captain spake,<br> And past the warders standing half awake<br> They came unto the King: sleeping he lay,<br> While o&#146;er his gold bed crept the daylight grey;<br> But softly thereunto the captain went,<br> And to his sleeping head his own down bent<br> And whispered; then as one who has just heard<br> Right in his ears the whisper of death's word,<br> He started up with eyes that, open wide,<br> Still saw not what the strange new light might hide;<br> Upright he sat, and panting for a while,<br> Till heeding at the last the captain's smile,<br> And low and humble words, he smiled and said:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well be ye! for I dreamed that I was dead<br> Before ye came, and waking thought that I<br> Was dead indeed, and that such things were nigh<br> As willingly men name not. What wouldst thou?<br> What new thing must the Lycians suffer now?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"King," said the captain, "here I have with me<br> A man-at-arms who joyful seems to be; <A NAME="page_325"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 325</FONT></A><br> Therefore I deem somewhat has come to pass,<br> Since for these many days no face here has<br> Made e&#146;en a show of gladness, or of more<br> Than thinking good it were if all were o&#146;er,&#151;<br> The slow tormenting hope&#151;the heavy fear.<br> Speak thou, good friend! the King is fain to hear<br> The tale thou hast to tell."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then spake the man:<br> "Good hap to me, indeed, that thus I can<br> Make glad the Lycian folk, and thee, O King!<br> But nowise have I wrought the happy thing,<br> But some immortal as meseems<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now I<br> With other two made up my mind to try<br> The chance of death or glorious life herein,<br> In good hope either rest from fear to win<br> Or many days of pleasure; so I armed<br> In this my father's gear, that had been charmed<br> Years long agone by spells, well worn I doubt<br> To nothing now, if one might clean tell out<br> The truth of all; then in Diana's fane<br> Anigh our house I met the other twain,<br> And forth we went at dawn, two days ago.<br> Not hard it was our rightful road to know,<br> For hour by hour of dreadful deaths we heard,<br> And still met fleeing folk, so sore afeard<br> That they must scowl upon us questioning.<br> And so at last we deemed the dreadful thing,<br> What death soever he dealt otherwhere <A NAME="page_326"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 326</FONT></A><br> From time to time, must have his chiefest lair<br> Within Minerva's consecrated lands,<br> That stretch from where her mighty temple stands<br> Midst its wild olive-groves, until they meet<br> The rugged mountain's bare unwooded feet.<br> Thither we turned, and at the end of day<br> We reached the temple, and with no delay<br> Sought out the priests and told them of our rede.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They answered us that heavy was their need,<br> That day by day they dreaded death would come<br> And take them from the midst of that fair home,<br> And shortly, that when midnight was passed o&#146;er,<br> Their lives in that house they would risk no more,<br> But get them gone. 'All things are done,' said they,<br> 'The sacred maids, who have not seen the day,<br> But in these precincts, count the minutes now<br> Until the midnight moon the way shall show;<br> Ten horse-loads of the precious things we have,<br> That somewhat of our past lives we may save<br> To bring us o&#146;er the sea. So sorry cheer,<br> Fair sons, of meat or lodging get ye here,<br> For all is bare and blank as some hill-side;<br> Nor, if ye love your lives, will ye abide<br> Another minute here: for us, indeed,<br> One answer more from Pallas do we need;<br> And, that being got at, nothing stays us then.'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Worn were the faces of these holy men,<br> And their eyes wandered even as they spake, <A NAME="page_327"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 327</FONT></A><br> And scarcely did they move as men awake<br> About that place, whose mighty walls of stone<br> Seemed waiting for the time when all was gone,<br> Except the presence of the Dreadful Maid,<br> Careless of who was glad and who afraid.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Shortly we answered; we would bide and see<br> What thing within the precinct there might be<br> Until the morn, and if we lived till then,<br> Further afield would seek this death of men.<br> They heard us wondering, or with scorn, but gave<br> Such cheer to us as yet they chanced to have;<br> And we, being weary, fell asleep withal<br> Within a chamber nigh the northern wall<br> Of the great temple. Such a dream I had,<br> As that I thought fair folk, in order glad,<br> Sang songs throughout a place I knew to be<br> A town whereof had tales been told to me<br> When I was but a youngling: years agone<br> Had I forgot it all, and now alone<br> The nameless place had come to me.&#151;O King,<br> I dreamed, I say, I heard much people sing<br> In happy wise; but even therewithal<br> Amidst my dream a great voice did there call,<br> But in a tongue I knew not; and each face<br> Was changed to utter horror in that place;<br> And yet the song rose higher, until all tune<br> Was strangled in it, and to shrill shrieks soon<br> It changed, and I sat upright in my bed, <A NAME="page_328"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 328</FONT></A><br> Waked in an instant, open-mouthed with dread.<br> I know not why&#151;though all about I heard<br> Shrill screams indeed, as though of folk afeard,<br> Mixed with a roar like white flame that doth break<br> From out a furnace-mouth: the earth did shake<br> Beneath my bed, and when my eyes I turned<br> Without the window, such a light there burned<br> As would have made the noon-tide sunshine grey.<br> There on the floor one of my fellows lay,<br> Half-armed and groaning like a wounded man;<br> And circling round about the other ran,<br> With foaming lips as one driven mad with fear.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I, who knew not what thing drew anear,<br> And scarce could think amid my dread, sat still<br> Trembling a little space of time, until<br> To me from out the jaws of death was born,<br> Without a hope it seemed, a sudden scorn<br> Of death and fear; for all the worst I knew,<br> And many a thing seemed false that had been true,<br> And many a thing now seemed of little worth<br> That once had made the mean and sordid earth<br> All glorious.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So with fixed and steady face<br> I armed myself; and turned to leave the place,<br> And passed from out it into the great hall<br> Of the very temple, where from wall to wall<br> There rolled a cloud of white and sulphurous smoke;<br> And there the remnant of the temple folk,<br> That had not heart enow to flee away, <A NAME="page_329"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 329</FONT></A><br> Like dying folk upon the pavement lay,<br> And some seemed dead indeed. High o&#146;er that gear<br> Stood golden Pallas, with her burnished spear<br> Glittering from out the smoke-cloud in that light,<br> That made strange day and ghastly of the night;<br> And her unmoved calm face that knew no smile<br> Cast no look down, as though she deemed too vile<br> The writhing tortured limbs, the sickening sound<br> Of dying groans of those that lay around,<br> Or to the pillars clung in agonies<br> Past telling of; but now I turned mine eyes,<br> Grown used to death within a little space,<br> Unto the other end of that fair place,<br> Where black the wood of polished pillars showed<br> Against the dreadful light, that throbbed and glowed,<br> Changing, and changing back to what it was.<br> So, through their rows did I begin to pass,<br> And heavier grew the smoke-cloud as I went;<br> But I, upon the face of death intent,<br> And what should come thereafter, made no stay<br> Until two fathom of white pavement lay<br> Betwixt me and the grass: the lit-up trees<br> Sparkled like quick-fire in the light night breeze,<br> And turned the sky black, and their stems between<br> The black depths of the inner wood were seen;<br> Like liquid flame a brook leapt out from them,<br> And, turning, ran along the forest hem:<br> &#146;Twixt that and me &#151;How shall I tell thereof,<br> And hope to &#146;scape hard word and bitter scoff? <A NAME="page_330"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 330</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let me say first that, changing horribly<br> That noise went on and seemed a part of me,<br> E&#146;en as the light; unless by death I won<br> Quiet again; earth's peace seemed long years gone,<br> And all its hopes poor toys of little worth.<br> Therefore I turned not, nor fell down to earth,<br> And still within my hand I held my sword,<br> And saw it all as I see thee, fair lord.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And this I saw: a mass, from whence there came<br> That fearful light, as from a heart of flame;<br> But black amid its radiance was that mass,<br> And black and claw-like things therefrom did pass,<br> Lengthening and shortening, and grey flocks of hair<br> Seemed moving on it with some inward air<br> The light bore with it; but in front of me<br> An upreared changing dark bulk did I see,<br> That my heart told me was the monster's head,<br> The seat of all the will that wrought our dread;<br> And midst thereof two orbs of red flame shone<br> When first I came, and then again were gone,<br> Then came again, like lights on a dark sea<br> As the thing turned. And now it seemed to me,<br> Moreover, that, despite the dreadful sound<br> That filled my very heart and shook the ground,<br> Mute was the horror's head, as the great shade<br> That sometimes, as in deep sleep we are laid<br> Seems ready to roll over us, and crush<br> Our souls to nought amidst its shadowy hush: <A NAME="page_331"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 331</FONT></A><br> Nor might I know how that dread noise was wrought.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, when unto the place I first was brought<br> Where now I stayed, and stared, I knew not well<br> If the thing moved; but deemed that I might tell<br> Ten fathoms o&#146;er betwixt us, and midway<br> &#146;Twixt me and it a temple-priest there lay,<br> Face foremost, armed, and in his hand a spear;<br> And as with fixed eyes I stood moveless there,<br> Striving to think how I should meet the thing,<br> Amidst that noise I heard his armour ring<br> As smitten by some stroke; and then I saw<br> Unto that hideous bulk the body draw,<br> And yet saw not what drew it; till at last<br> Into the huge dark mass it slowly passed.<br> Nor did the monster change; unless, methought<br> A little nigher thereto I was brought<br> And still my eyes were fixed on it; with hand<br> Upon my drawn-back sword I still did stand,<br> Mid thoughts of folk who meet dread things alone<br> In dreadful lands, and slowly turn to stone.<br> So stood I: quicker grew my fevered breath,<br> Long, long, the time seemed betwixt life and death,<br> And I began to waver therewithal,<br> And at the last I opened lips to call<br> Aloud, and made no sound; then fell my brand<br> Clanging adown from out my feeble hand,<br> And rest seemed sweet again; one step I made<br> Aback, to gain a huge pier's deep black shade, <A NAME="page_332"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 332</FONT></A><br> Then at my fallen sword in vain I stared,<br> And could not stoop to it&#151;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And then there blared<br> A new sound forth, I deemed a trumpet-blast,<br> And o&#146;er mine eyes a dull thick veil seemed cast,<br> And my knees bent beneath me, and I fell<br> A dead heap to the earth, with death and hell<br> Once more a pain, and terrible once more,<br> Teaching me dreadful things of hidden lore,<br> Showing strange pictures to my soul forlorn<br> That cursed the wretched day when I was born.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There lay I, as it seemed, a weary tide,<br> Nor knew I if I lived yet, or had died,<br> E&#146;en as the other folk, of utter fear,<br> When in mine ears a new voice did I hear,<br> Nor knew at first what words it said to me;<br> Till my eyes opened, and I seemed to see,<br> Grown grey and soft, the marble pillars there,<br> And &#146;twixt their shafts afar the woodland fair,<br> As if through clear green water; then I heard<br> Close by my very head a kindly word:<br> 'Be of good cheer! the earth is earth again,<br> And thou hadst heart enow to face the bane<br> Of Lycia, though the Gods would not that thou<br> Shouldst slay him utterly: but rise up now<br> If so thou mayst, and help me, for I bleed,<br> And of some leech-craft have I speedy need,<br> Though no life-blood it is that flows from me.' <A NAME="page_333"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 333</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then clearer grew mine eyes, and I could see<br> An armed man standing over me, and I<br> Rose up therewith and stood unsteadily,<br> And gazed around, and saw that the fell light<br> Had vanished utterly; fast waned the night<br> And a cold wind blew, as the young dawn strove<br> With the low moon and the faint stars above,<br> And all was quiet. But that new-come man,<br> Standing beside me in the twilight wan,<br> Seemed like a god, come down to make again<br> Another earth all free from death and pain.<br> Tall was he, fair he seemed unto me then<br> Beyond the beauty of the sons of men:<br> But as our eyes met, and mine, shamed and weak,<br> Dropped before his, once more he &#146;gan to speak:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Be not ashamed,' he said, 'but look around,<br> And thou shalt see thy fear lie on the ground,<br> No more divine or dreadful.'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I saw<br> A tangled mass of hair, and scale, and claw,<br> Lie wallowing on the grey down-trodden grass;<br> Huge was it certes, but nought like the mass<br> Of horror mid the light my fear still told<br> My shuddering heart of, nor could I behold<br> Clearly the monster's shape in that dim light;<br> Yet gladly did I turn me from the sight<br> Unto my fellow, and I said:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Hast thou <A NAME="page_334"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 334</FONT></A><br> Some other shape unto mine eyes to show?<br> And is this part of the grim mockery<br> Whereto the Gods have driven me forth to die?<br> Or art thou such a dream as meets the dead<br> When first they die?'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am a man,' he said,<br> 'E&#146;en as thou art; thou livest, if I live;<br> And some god unto me such strength did give,<br> That this my father's&nbsp;father's sword hath wrought<br> Deliverance for the Lycians, and made nought<br> This divine dread&#151;but let us come again<br> When day is grown; and I have eased the pain<br> Of burning thirst that chokes me, and thine hands<br> Have swathed my hurts here with fair linen bands,<br> For somewhat faint I grow.'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So then we passed<br> Betwixt the pillars till we reached at last<br> The chamber where I erst had slept, and there<br> We drank, and then his hurts with water fair<br> I bathed, and swathed them; and by then the day<br> Showed how my fellows on the pavement lay<br> Dead, yet without a wound it seemed; and when<br> Into the pillared hall we came again,<br> From one unto the other did we go<br> That lay about the place, and even so<br> It was with them; then the new-corner sighed<br> And said: 'Belike it was of fear they died,<br> Yet wish them not alive again, for they<br> Had found death fearful on another day; <A NAME="page_335"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 335</FONT></A><br> But gladly had I never seen this sight,<br> For I shall think thereof at whiles by night,<br> And wonder if all life is worth such woe&#151;<br> But now unto the quarry let us go.'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So forth we went, but when we came whereas<br> The beast lay, slantwise o&#146;er the wind-swept grass<br> Shone the low sun on what was left of him,<br> For all about the trodden earth did swim<br> In horrible corruption of black blood,<br> And in the midst thereof his carcase stood,<br> E&#146;en like a keel beat down and castaway<br> At dead ebb high up in a sandy bay.<br> But when I gathered heart close up to go<br> And touch that master of all horror, lo,<br> How had he changed! for nothing now was there<br> But skin, beset with scale and dreadful hair<br> Drawn tight about the bones: flesh, muscle strong,<br> And all that helped the life of that great wrong,<br> Had ebbed away with life; his head, deep cleft<br> By the fair hero's sword-edge, yet had left<br> Three teeth like spears within it; on the ground<br> The rest had fallen, and now lay around<br> Half hidden in the marsh his blood had made;<br> Hollow his sides did sound when, still afraid<br> Of what he had been, with my clenched hand<br> I smote him. So a minute did we stand<br> Wondering, until my fellow said to me:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the past night didst thou do valiantly, <A NAME="page_336"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 336</FONT></A><br> So smite the head from off him, and then go<br> This finished work unto the King to show,<br> And tell him by that token that I come,<br> Who heretofore have had no quiet home<br> Either in Corinth or the Argive land.<br> Here till to-morrow bide I, to withstand<br> What new thing yet may come; for strange to me<br> Are all these things, nor know I if I be<br> Waking or sleeping yet, although methinks<br> My soul some foretaste of a great bliss drinks.<br> So get thee to the work, and then go forth;<br> These coming days in sooth will show the worth<br> Of what my hand hath wrought!'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Weary he seemed<br> And spake, indeed, well-nigh as one who dreamed;<br> But yet his word I durst not disobey;<br> With no great pain I smote the head away<br> From off the trunk, and humbly bade farewell<br> Unto my godlike saviour from deep hell;<br> I gat my horse, and to the saddle bound<br> The monster's head, whose long mane swept the ground,<br> Whose weight e&#146;en now was no light pack-horse load,<br> And so with merry heart went on my road,<br> And made on toward the city, where I thought<br> A little after nightfall to be brought;<br> But so it was, that ere I had gone through<br> The wasted country and now well-nigh drew<br> Unto the lands where people yet did dwell, <A NAME="page_337"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 337</FONT></A><br> So dull a humour on my spirit fell,<br> That at the last I might not go nor stand;<br> So, holding still the reins in my right hand,<br> I laid me down upon the sunburnt grass<br> Of the road-side, and just high noon it was.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But moonrise was it when I woke again;<br> My horse grazed close beside with dangling rein;<br> But when I called him, and he turned to me,<br> No burden on his back I now might see,<br> And wondered; for right firmly had I bound<br> The thing unto him; then I searched around<br> Lest he perchance had rolled, and in such wise<br> Had rid him of that weight; and as mine eyes<br> Grew used to the grey moonlight, I could trace<br> A line of greyish ashes, as from place<br> To greener place, the wandering beast had fed;<br> But nothing more I saw of that grim head.<br> Then much I wondered, and my fear waxed great,<br> And I &#146;gan doubt if there I should not wait<br> The coming of that glorious mighty one,<br> Who for the world so great a deed had done.<br> But at the last I thought it good to go<br> Unto the town e&#146;en as he bade me do,<br> Because his words constrained me. Nought befell<br> Upon the road whereof is need to tell,<br> And so my tale is done; and though it be<br> That I no token have to show to thee,<br> Yet doubt not, King Jobates, that no more<br> The Gods will vex the land as heretofore <A NAME="page_338"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 338</FONT></A><br> With this fell torment. Furthermore, if he<br> Who wrought this deed is no divinity<br> He will be here soon; so must thou devise,<br> O Lycian King, in whatso greatest wise<br> Thou wilt reward him&#151;but for me, I pray<br> That thou wilt give me to him from to-day,<br> That serving him, and in his company,<br> Not wholly base I too become to be."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King and captain for a little while<br> Gazed each at each; an ugly covert smile<br> Lurked round the captain's mouth, but the King stared<br> Blankly upon him, e&#146;en as though he heard<br> A doom go forth against him; and again<br> The man who brought the news stared at the twain<br> With knitted brows, as greatly marvelling<br> Why they spake nought, until at last the King<br> Turned eyes upon him, and the captain spake:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certes, O King, brightly the day doth break<br> If this man sayeth sooth; nor know I one<br> To do this deed except Bellerophon;<br> And so much certes hast thou honoured him<br> That nothing now thy glory can wax dim<br> Because of his; and though indeed the earth<br> Hold nought within it of such wondrous worth<br> As that which thou wilt give him in reward,<br> Not overmuch it is for such a sword,<br> And such a heart, the people's very friend." <A NAME="page_339"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 339</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So spake he, and before his speech had end<br> His wonted face at last the King had got,<br> And spake unto the man:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We doubt thee not;<br> Thy tale seems true, nor dost thou glorify<br> Thyself herein&#151;certes thou wouldst abye<br> A heavy fate if thou shouldst lie herein&#151;<br> So here shalt thou abide till sight we win<br> Of him who wrought this deed; then shalt thou have<br> A good reward, as one both true and brave<br> As for a son of man, for he, meseems,<br> Who made an end of our so fearful dreams<br> Is scarcely man, though friend to me a man&#151;<br> But now this tale of thine, that well began<br> And went on clearly, clearly has not told<br> The very shape of what thou didst behold."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No," said the man, "when I stood therebeside<br> Methought its likeness ever would abide<br> Within my mind! but now, what shall I say&#151;<br> Hast thou not heard, O King, before to-day,<br> That it was three-formed? So men said to me,<br> Before its very body I did see<br> That, lion-like, the beast's shape was before,<br> And that its goat-like hairy middle bore<br> A dragon's scaly folds across the waste<br> Itself had made. But I, who oft have faced<br> The yellow beast, and driven goats afield,<br> And shaken the black viper from my shield, <A NAME="page_340"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 340</FONT></A><br> Can liken it to these things in no whit.<br> Nay, as I try e&#146;en now to think of it,<br> Meseems that when I woke in the past night,<br> E&#146;en like a dream dissolved by morning light,<br> Its memory had gone from me; though, indeed,<br> Nought I forgot of all my dreadful need.<br> Content thee, King, with what I erst have told;<br> For when I try his image to behold<br> Faint grows my heart again, mine eyes wax dim,<br> Nor can I set forth what I deemed of him<br> When he lay dead.&#151;Hearken,&#151;what thing draws nigh?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For from outside there rang a joyous cry,<br> That grew, still coming nearer, till they heard<br> From out the midst thereof a well-known word,<br> The name Bellerophon: then from his bed<br> The King arose, and clad himself, and said:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go, captain, set the King Bellerophon<br> Without delay upon the royal throne,<br> And tell him that I come to make my prayer,<br> That, since for a long time I have sat there,<br> And know no other trade than this of King,<br> He of his bounty yet will add a thing<br> To all that he hath given, and let me reign<br> Along with him. Send here my chamberlain,<br> That I may clothe me in right fitting guise<br> To do him honour in all goodly wise." <A NAME="page_341"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 341</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So spake his lips, but his eyes seemed to say;<br> 'Long is it to the ending of the day,<br> And many a thing may hap ere eventide;<br> And well is he who longest may abide.'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from the presence did the captain pass,<br> When now the autumn morn in glory was,<br> And when he reached the palace court, he found<br> The eager people flocking all around<br> The door of the great hall, and variously<br> Men showed their joyance at that victory.<br> But in the hall there stood Bellerophon<br> Anigh the da&iuml;s, and the young sun shone<br> On his bright arms, and round from man to man<br> In eager notes the hurried question ran,<br> And, smiling still, he answered each; but yet<br> Small share that circle of his tale did get,<br> Because distraught he was, and seemed to be<br> As he who looks the face of one to see<br> Who long delays; but when the captain's staff<br> Cleft through the people's eager word and laugh,<br> And, after that, his fellow of the night<br> Bellerophon beheld, his face grew bright<br> As one who sees the end. Withal he said<br> As they drew nigh:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Has the King seen the head,<br> Knows he what it betokens? For, behold!<br> Before the sun of that day grew acold<br> Whereon thou left&#146;st me, all that heap was gone <A NAME="page_342"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 342</FONT></A><br> Thou sawest there, both hair and flesh and bone;<br> So when this dawn I mounted my good steed,<br> I looked to thee to show forth that my deed,<br> Lest all should seem a feigned tale or a dream."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Master," the other said, "thou well mayst deem,<br> That what thy will loosed, my will might not hold;<br> E&#146;en as thy tale, so must my tale be told,<br> And nought is left to show of that dread thing."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E&#146;en as he spake did folk cry on the King,<br> And now to right and left fell back the crowd,<br> And down the lane of folk gold raiment glowed,<br> And blare of silver trumpets smote the roof.<br> Then said the captain:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Certes, no more proof<br> The King will ask, to show that thou hast done<br> The glorious deed that was for thee alone;<br> Be glad, thy day is come, and all is well!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on his sword the hero's left hand fell,<br> And he looked down and muttered &#146;neath his breath,<br> "Trust slayeth many a man, the wise man saith;<br> Yet must I trust perforce." He stood and heard<br> The joyful people's many-voic&egrave;d word<br> Change into a glad shout; the feet of those<br> Who drew anear came closer and more close,<br> Till their sound ceased, and silence filled the hall; <A NAME="page_343"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 343</FONT></A><br> And then a soft voice on his ears did fall,<br> That seemed the echo to his yearning thought:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look up, look up! the change of days hath brought<br> Sweet end to our desires, and made thee mine!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his eyes, and saw gold raiment shine<br> Before him in the low sun; but a face<br> Above it made the murmuring crowded place<br> Silent and lone; for there she stood, indeed,<br> His troublous scarce-kept life's last crown and meed<br> Her sweet lips trembled, her dear eyes &#146;gan swim<br> In tears that fell not, as she reached to him<br> One hand in greeting, while a little raised<br> And restless was the other, as she gazed<br> Into his eyes, and lowly was her mien;<br> But yet a little forward did she lean,<br> As though she looked for sudden close embrace,<br> Yet feared it &#146;neath the strange eyes of that place.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But though his heart was melted utterly<br> Within him, he but drew a little nigh,<br> And took her hand, and said:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What hour is this<br> That brings so fair a thing to crown my bliss?<br> What land far off from that which first I knew?<br> How shall I know that such a thing is true, <A NAME="page_344"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 344</FONT></A><br> Unless some pain yet falls on thee and me?<br> Rather this hour is called eternity,<br> This land the land of heaven, and we have died<br> That thus at last we might go side by side<br> For ever, in the flower-strewn happy place."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then closer to her drew his bright flushed face;<br> Well-nigh their lips met, when Jobates cried:<br> "Good hap, Corinthian! for thou hast not died;<br> The pale land holds no joy like thou wilt have<br> If yet awhile the Gods thy dear life save.<br> Yet mayst thou fear, indeed, for such thou art,<br> That yet the Gods will have thee play thy part<br> In heaven and not on earth&#151;But come on now,<br> And see if this my throne be all too low<br> For thy great heart; sit here with me to-day,<br> And in the shrines of the Immortals pray,<br> With many offerings, lest they envy thee,<br> And on the morrow wed Philono&euml;,<br> And live thy life thereafter."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he spake,<br> Smiling, and yet a troubled look did break<br> Across the would-be frankness of his smile.<br> But still the hero stood a little while<br> And watched Philono&euml;, as she turned and went<br> Adown the hall, and then a sigh he sent<br> From out his heart, and turned unto the King<br> As one who had no thought that anything<br> Of guile clung round him, and said: <A NAME="page_345"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 345</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Deem thou not,<br> O King, that ruin from me thou hast got,<br> Although I take from thee my due reward;<br> For still for thee my hand shall hold the sword,<br> Nor will I claim more than thou givest me,<br> And great is that, though a king's son I be."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on the throne was set Bellerophon,<br> And on his head was laid the royal crown<br> Instead of helm; and just as safe he felt<br> As though mid half-fed savage beasts he dwelt.<br> Yet when he went out through the crowded street,<br> Shouting because of him, when blossoms sweet<br> Faint with the autumn fell upon his head,<br> When his feet touched the silken carpet spread<br> Over the temple-steps; when the priests' hymn<br> Rang round him in the inner temple dim,<br> He smiled for pleasure once or twice, and said:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So many dangers, yet I am not dead;<br> So many fears, yet sweet is longing grown,<br> Because to-morrow morn I gain my own!<br> So much desire, and but a night there is<br> Betwixt me and the perfecting of bliss!" <A NAME="page_346"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 346</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>SO fell the noisy day to feastful night,<br> For sleep was slow to hush the new delight<br> Of the freed folk; and in the royal house<br> Loud did the revellers grow, and clamorous,<br> And yet that too must have an end at last,<br> And to their sleeping-places all folk passed<br> Not long before the shepherds' sleep grew thin.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But listening to the changing of the din,<br> Philono&euml; lay long upon her bed,<br> Nor would sweet sleep come down to bless her head,<br> No, not when all was still again; for she,<br> Oppressed with her new-found felicity,<br> Had fallen to thoughts of life and death and change,<br> And through strange lands her wearied heart did range,<br> And knew no peace; therefore at last she rose<br> When all was utter stillness and stood close<br> Unto the window. Such a night it was<br> That a thin wind swept o&#146;er the garden-grass<br> And loosened the sick leaves upon the trees;<br> Promise of rain there was within the breeze,<br> Yet was the sky not wholly overcast,<br> But o&#146;er the moon yet high the grey drift passed,<br> And with a watery gleam at whiles she shone,<br> And cast strange wavering shadows down upon<br> The trembling beds of autumn blossoms tall,<br> And made the dusk of the white garden wall<br> Gleam like another land against the sky. <A NAME="page_347"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 347</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned her from the window presently,<br> And went unto her dainty bed once more;<br> But as she touched its silk a change came o&#146;er<br> Her anxious heart, and listening there she stood,<br> Counting the eager throbbing of her blood;<br> But nought she heard except the night's dim noise;<br> Then did she whisper (and her faint, soft voice<br> Seemed hoarse and loud to her)&#151;"Yet will I go<br> To Pallas' shrine, for fain I am to know<br> If all things even yet may go aright,<br> For my heart fails me."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the blind dusk night<br> She showed her loveliness awhile half-veiled,<br> When she had spoke, as though her purpose failed;<br> Then softly did she turn and take to her<br> A dusky cloak, and hid her beauty rare<br> In its dark folds, and turned unto the door;<br> But ere she passed its marble threshold o&#146;er<br> Stayed pondering, and she said:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alas, alas!<br> To-morrow must I say that all this was<br> And is not&#151;this sweet longing?&#151;what say men&#151;<br> It cometh once and cometh not again,<br> This first love for another? holds the earth<br> Within its circle aught that is of worth<br> When it is dead?&#151;and this is part of it,<br> This measureless sweet longing that doth flit,<br> Never to come again, when all is won.<br> And is our first desire so soon foredone, <A NAME="page_348"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 348</FONT></A><br> Like to the rose-bud, that through day and night<br> In early summer strives to meet the light,<br> And in some noon-tide of the June, bursts sheath,<br> And ere the eve is past away in death?<br> Belike love dies then like the rest of life?<br> &#151;Or fails asleep until it mix with strife<br> And fear and grief?&#151;and then we call it pain,<br> And curse it for its labour lost in vain.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sweet pain! be kind to me and leave me not!<br> Leave me not cold, with all my grief forgot,<br> And all the joy consumed I thought should fill<br> My changing troubled days of life, until<br> Death turned all measuring of the days to nought!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And thou, O death, when thou my life hast caught<br> Within thy net, what wilt thou with my love,<br> That now I deem no lapse of time can move?<br> O death, maybe that though I seem to pass<br> And come to nought, with all that once I was,<br> Yet love shall live I called a part of me,<br> And hold me in his heart despite of thee,<br> And call me part of him, when I am dead<br> As the world talks of dying."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she said,<br> But scarcely heard her voice, and through the door<br> Of her own chamber passed; light on the floor<br> Her white feet fell, her soft clothes rustled nought,<br> As slowly, wrapped in many a changing thought,<br> Unto the Maiden's shrine she took her way<br> That midmost of the palace precincts lay; <A NAME="page_349"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 349</FONT></A><br> But in a chamber that was hard thereby,<br> Although she knew it not, that night did lie<br> Her love that was, her lord that was to be.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the dark pillared precinct, silently<br> She went now, pausing every now and then<br> To listen, but heard little sound of men;<br> Though far off in the hill-side homesteads crowed<br> The waking fowl, or restless milch-kine lowed<br> In the fair pastures that her love had saved;<br> And from the haven, as the shipmen heaved<br> Their sail aloft, a mingled strange voice came.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So as she went, across her flitted shame<br> Of her own loneliness, and eager love<br> That shut the world out so, and she &#146;gan move<br> With quicker steps unto the temple-stead,<br> Scarce knowing what her soft feet thither led.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within an open space the temple was,<br> And dark-stemmed olives rose up from the grass<br> About it, but a marble path passed o&#146;er<br> The space betwixt the cloister and its door<br> Of some ten yards; there on its brink she stayed,<br> And from the cloister watched the black trees swayed<br> In the night breeze. E&#146;en as a bather might<br> Shrink from the water, from the naked night<br> She shrank a little&#151;the wind wailed within <A NAME="page_350"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 350</FONT></A><br> The cloister walls, the clouds were gotten thin<br> About the moon, and the night &#146;gan to wane&#151;<br> Then, even as she raised her skirts again<br> And put her foot forth, did she hear arms clash,<br> And fear and shame her heart did so abash,<br> She shrank behind a pillar; then the sound<br> Of footsteps smote upon the hardened ground,<br> And &#146;gainst the white steps of the shrine she saw<br> From out the trees a tall dark figure draw<br> Unto the holy place: the moon withal<br> Ran from a cloud now, and her light did fall<br> Upon a bright steel helm: she trembled then,<br> But her first thought was not of sons of men;<br> Of the armed goddess, rather, did she think,<br> And closer in her hiding-place did shrink.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then though the moon grew dull again, yet she<br> Ten shapes of armed men at the last could see<br> Steal up the steps and vanish from the night,<br> And a sharp pang shot through her; but affright<br> She felt not now of gods: she murmured low;<br> "What do these men-at-arms in such guise now<br> Amidst the feast? God help me, we are caught<br> Within a brazen net!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with that thought<br> No more delay she made but girt her gown<br> Unto her, and with swift feet went adown<br> The marble steps, and so from tree to tree,<br> Through all the darkest shadow, silently <A NAME="page_351"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 351</FONT></A><br> Gained the dark side of the brass temple door;<br> And through its chink she saw the marble floor<br> Just feebly lit by some small spark of light<br> She saw not, and the gleam of armour white,<br> And knew that she unto the men was close.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E&#146;en as some sound that loud and louder grows<br> Within our dreams and yet is nought at all<br> She heard her heart, as clinging to the wall<br> She strove to listen vainly; but at last<br> All feebleness from out her did she cast<br> With thought of love&#151;and death that drew anear-<br> And therewithal a low voice did she hear,<br> She thought she knew.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Milo the Colchian?"<br> It said as asking, and another man<br> Said "Here" in a hoarse voice and low; once more<br> The first voice said; "The Clearer of the Shore,<br> Known by no other name the people say,<br> Art thou here too?" a new voice muttered "Yea."<br> And then again the first:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My tale told o&#146;er<br> And none found wanting&#151;since ye know wherefore<br> We here are met, few words are best to-night:<br> Within the ivory chamber, called the White,<br> Lies the ill monster's bane, asleep belike,<br> Or, at the worst without a sword to strike,<br> Or shield to ward withal; his wont it is<br> To have few by him; on this night of bliss <A NAME="page_352"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 352</FONT></A><br> Those few of night-cropped herbs enow have drunk,<br> And deep in slumber like short death are sunk:<br> So light our work is; yet let those who lack<br> Heart thereunto e&#146;en at this hour go back;<br> Though&#151;let these take good heed that whatsoe&#146;er<br> We risk hereafter they in likewise share,<br> Except the risk of dying by his sword."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ceased awhile, and a low muttered word<br> Seemed to say, "We are ready:" then he said:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When he is slain, then shall ye bear his bed<br> Into this shrine, and burn what burned may be<br> In little space; but into the deep sea<br> Thou Clearer of the Shore, with thy two men<br> Shalt bear him forth.&#151;Fellows, what say we then,<br> When on the morn the city wakes to find<br> Its saviour gone? This:&#151;'Men are fools and blind,<br> And the Gods all-wise; this man born on earth<br> By some strange chance, yet was of too great worth<br> To live, and go as common men may go;<br> Therefore the Gods, who set him work to do,<br> When that was done, had no more will to see<br> His head grow white; or with man's frailty<br> Burn out his heart; they might not hear him curse<br> His latter days, as unto worse and worse<br> He fell at last; therefore they took him hence<br> To make him sharer in omnipotence,<br> And crown him with their immortality, <A NAME="page_353"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 353</FONT></A><br> Nor may ye hope his body more to see.<br> These ashes of the web wherein last lay<br> His godlike limbs that took your fear away,<br> (Limbs now a very god's), this fire-stained gold<br> That, unharmed, very god might nowise hold,<br> Are left for certain signs&#151;so shall ye rear<br> A temple to him nigh the gate; and bear<br> Gifts of good things unto the one who wrought<br> Deliverance for you, when ye e&#146;en were brought<br> Unto the very gate of death and hell.'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fellows, spread vaguely this tale that I tell!<br> But thou, O Chremes, when the work is done<br> Get straight unto the forest all alone,<br> And with some slaughtered beast come back again<br> Ere noon, as though of hearers thou wert fain;<br> Folk know thee for a wanderer through the wood,<br> So make thy tale up as thou deemest good<br> Of voices heard by thee at dead of night;<br> So shall our words live and all things be right.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come, then; the night is changing; good it were<br> That dawn's first glimmer did not find us here!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So spake he, and then opened wide the door,<br> And all seemed lonely there as heretofore;<br> So one by one adown the steps they stole,<br> Setting their anxious faces to the goal<br> Of the White Chamber.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Philono&euml;,<br> Fair-footed, tender-limbed, and where was she? <A NAME="page_354"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 354</FONT></A><br> Her sick heart did but note the name and place<br> They spoke of, ere she moved her woe-worn face<br> From the cold brass, and stayed to hear no more,<br> But stole away as silent as before,<br> Keeping love back till all were lost or won;<br> Nor knew she what she set her feet upon<br> Till, panting, through his chamber-door she passed;<br> There through the dusk a quick glance round she cast<br> And saw his men asleep, nor knew if they<br> Were dead, or if in sleep indeed they lay;<br> Then with such haste as a spent man, borne down<br> A swift stream, catches at some bare bough brown,<br> From off the wall she took sword, shield, and spear,<br> Hauberk and helm, and drew his bed anear,<br> And stayed not now, nor thought, but on his breast,<br> Laid bare before her, a light hand she pressed,<br> And as he started upright in the bed<br> Beneath her touch, bowed down to him and said:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak not, but listen to Philono&euml;,<br> Thy love, and save thy life for thee and me!<br> Thy foes are on thee! make no more delay<br> As thou art wise!&#151;needs must I go away;<br> I do my part&#151;one minute more shall show,<br> If love in death or life we are to know."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His lips yet trembled, yet his heart did ache<br> With longing, ere he felt he was awake<br> And knew that she was gone, and knew not where: <A NAME="page_355"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 355</FONT></A><br> So driving back desire he armed him there<br> Over his nakedness, and hastily<br> Caught up his weapons, and turned round to see<br> What help was nigh: and when he saw his men<br> Lie on the floor as dead, well deemed he then<br> His hour was come; and yet he felt as though<br> He scarce might tell if it were hard to go,<br> So short all life seemed that must end at last;<br> But therewith nowise hope from him he cast,<br> But on the golden bed he took his stand,<br> And poised the well-steeled spear in his right hand,<br> And waited listening.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mid the fallen leaves&#146; sound,<br> Driven by the autumn wind along the ground,<br> Footfalls of stealthy men he seemed to hear;<br> Yet nowise might that minute teach him fear,<br> Who life-long had not learned to speak the name;<br> Calm to his lips his steady breath still came,<br> Well-nigh he smiled; wide open were his eyes,<br> As though they looked to see life's mysteries<br> Unfolded soon before them; as he gazed<br> Through the dusk room, he heard the light latch raised<br> And saw the door move.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even therewithal<br> A gleam of bright light from the sky did fall,<br> As from a fleecy cloud the white moon ran,<br> And smiling, stern, unlike the face of man,<br> His helmed head high o&#146;er the black-shadowed floor <A NAME="page_356"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 356</FONT></A><br> Showed strange and dreadful, as the ivory door<br> Swung back on well-oiled hinges silently.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence a little space yet,&#151;then a cry<br> Burst from his lips, and through the chamber rang<br> A shriek of fear therewith, and a great clang<br> Of falling arms, and the bright glittering brand<br> Instead of the long spear was in his hand.<br> But for his foes, across the threshold lay<br> Their leader slain, and those his fellows, they<br> Hung wavering by the door, and feared the night,<br> And feared the godlike man, who in his might<br> Seemed changed indeed according to the tale<br> They were to tell: but as with faces pale<br> And huddled spears they hung there, in their doubt<br> If he were God or man, a mighty shout<br> Came from his lips again, and there was cast<br> Across the windy night a huge horn's blast,<br> Hoarse, loud, and long-enduring; and they fled<br> This way and that, pursued by nought but dread.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But strange tales of that night of fear they told<br> In after days. Some said they did behold,<br> As through the mighty outer door they ran,<br> A woman greater than a child of man,<br> All armed and helmed: some told of a bright flame<br> Glowing about the hero, when they came<br> Unto the door, and said that his one word<br> Had slain their leader swifter than a sword. <A NAME="page_357"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 357</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for Bellerophon, awhile he stood<br> Nigh to the door until his wrathful mood<br> Changed into scorn; and then the moonlight wan<br> With kindled light he helped, and then the man<br> His spear had reached in strong arms he upraised;<br> But when he saw the eyes that on him gazed<br> With dead stare, then he knew the captain's face.<br> "Fool," said he, "fear hath brought thee to this case,<br> Long hadst thou lived for me&#151;but is this all?<br> Will not the voice of Sthenob&#156;a call<br> O&#146;er the green waves to ghosts of lovers dead,<br> Ere yet the bridal wreath is on my head?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E&#146;en as he spake he heard the horn once more,<br> And then a sound as if on a low shore<br> The sea were breaking, then a swelling shout<br> That louder grew, till his own name leapt out<br> From midst of it, and then he smiled and cried:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pr&#156;tus, thy casket held a goodly bride,<br> A noble realm for me! O love, I come;<br> Surely thine heart has won me a fair home,<br> Instead of that straight house I should have had<br> If these eyes had not made thy dear heart glad."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith he sheathed his sword, and stepping o&#146;er<br> His cumbered threshold, made for the great door,<br> Whither the wakened house now thronging ran: <A NAME="page_358"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 358</FONT></A><br> Men armed and unarmed, child and ancient man;<br> For death it was to wind that mighty horn,<br> But when in dangerous battle it was borne<br> By the king's, hand. Now nigher as he drew<br> Unto the door he &#146;gan to see therethrough<br> The points of steel tossing amid the light<br> Of torches, and the wind of waning night<br> Bore sound of many men on it; but dim<br> The pillared hall was yet. Then close to him<br> A slim close-mantled woman came and said:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go forth and speak&#151;we twain are not yet dead.<br> I think we shall not die at all, dear heart;<br> Farewell!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His soul and body seemed to part,<br> As swiftly, shadow-like, she passed him by,<br> And toward her chamber went: unwittingly<br> He gained the great door's platform, and looked down<br> Upon the tumult of the gathering town.<br> While at his back a dark mass clustered now,<br> With helmet on the head, and spear and how;<br> So, gathering earthly thoughts, he stood and cried:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What will ye, good men, that ye make this tide<br> More noisy than the day? What will ye do?<br> Speak out, that we may rest, some one of you!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then stood a man forth, clad in armour bright, <A NAME="page_359"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 359</FONT></A><br> And cried aloud: "O, well betide the night<br> That hides thee not from us, Bellerophon!<br> Surely we deemed some horror had been done,<br> And deemed the Gods had ta&#146;en thee from our hands;<br> Because the horn, the terror of far lands,<br> The gift of Neptune, did we seem to hear."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said the hero: "Ah, then all the fear<br> The beast divine brought with it is not gone<br> Masters, ye dreamed belike&#151;nor dreamed alone<br> Strange dreams; for I dreamed too,&#151;that all-armed men<br> Beset my door to take my life; and when<br> I went therefrom e&#146;en now, why yet I dreamed<br> E&#146;en as I went upright&#151;because meseemed<br> Over my threshold lay a man new slain.<br> Be merry, O my masters; go again<br> Unto your well-hung beds; to-morrow comes,<br> Whereon ye praise the Gods for your saved homes<br> With great rejoicings, and raise hands for me<br> And my beloved midst your festivity."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ceased, and a great shout the twilight rent,<br> And one by one unto their homes they went.<br> Then turned the Prince unto the palace band,<br> And saw a certain one on his right hand,<br> Making as he would speak, and knew him straight<br> To be the man who had the heart to wait<br> The beast now slain. Smiling on him, he said: <A NAME="page_360"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 360</FONT></A><br> "What, hast thou dreamed the monster was not dead?<br> Good is it that the grain is gathered in,<br> Else should men dream that they the crop did win<br> Last week, and let it stand afield to rot!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay," said the man, "O master, I dreamed not;<br> But from yon flanking tower, waking, I saw<br> A shadowy figure toward the great horn draw,<br> And blow a blast thereon, then vanish quite,<br> Not like a mortal thing, into the night."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then spake a grey old man: "Yea, think thereon<br> As of a portent, O Bellerophon,<br> Of wondrous things to come, that thou shalt see,<br> As showing forth how great thy days shall be;<br> For doubt not this was Pallas, who would show<br> How great a gift she gives the city now."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again from these there rang a joyous shout;<br> But the Prince hung his head, as if in doubt<br> Of the new time with hidden lies begun.<br> At last he said:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go, friends, ere yet the sun<br> Has slain the stars outright; what things soe&#146;er<br> May hap, the Gods will have of me good care,<br> This night at least!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So through the house they went<br> Each to his place, when nigh the night was spent. <A NAME="page_361"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 361</FONT></A><br> But when to his own door Bellerophon<br> Was come, the captain's body was clean gone,<br> And the drugged men were waking. Then he thought,<br> "Was it a dream, indeed, that these things brought<br> Before mine eyes? Nay, my lips tremble yet<br> With that sweet touch. My breast may more forget<br> This hauberk's weight, than that sweet clinging hand.<br> I dreamed not, and this haunted Lycian land<br> Holds for me good and evil infinite.<br> So be it, and the new returning light<br> Shall bring new rede to guard my troubled ways.<br> May the Gods give beginning of good days!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on the bed he sat to think of her,<br> But ere the end of the grey time was there<br> His head had fallen aside; sleeping he lay,<br> And let the bright sun bring about the day.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>HE woke at last, and fresh and joyous felt,<br> As forth he went; no sword within his belt<br> He set that morn; he bore no biting spear;<br> But clad he was in gold and royal gear,<br> Such as a King might bear in Saturn's reign;<br> And in such wise the great hall did he gain,<br> And on the ivory throne he sat him down, <A NAME="page_362"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 362</FONT></A><br> And felt the golden circle of the crown,<br> But light as yet, upon his unused head.<br> Then to his presence were strange people led;<br> Hunters from far-off corners of the realm,<br> Shipmen with hands well hardened by the helm,<br> Merchants who in strange tongues must bid him thrive,<br> And dainty cherished things unto him give<br> And still he wearied, and their words forgot,<br> And wondered why the other King came not.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yet, before the ending of the morn,<br> The casket that his own hands once had borne,<br> Was brought unto him by a man, who spake<br> In this wise:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"King Jobates bids thee take,<br> O King Bellerophon, what lies herein,<br> And saith that since thine office doth begin<br> This day, right good it were to judge of this&#151;<br> If the man did so utterly amiss<br> To strive to keep his oath. He bids thee say<br> Withal if thou wilt have what yesterday<br> He gave unto thine hands&#151;and, taking it,<br> Forget wild dreams that o&#146;er the year did flit."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then King Bellerophon looked down, and drew<br> A letter from that casket that he knew,<br> And opened it and read; and in such wise<br> It gave the key to half-deemed mysteries. <A NAME="page_363"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 363</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>King Pr&#156;tus to Jobates, King of men,<br> Sends goodly greeting.&#151;Dost thou mind thee when<br> I saved thee from the lions? then I had<br> One gift from thee which has not made me glad,<br> Thy daughter; though a goddess, all men said,<br> Had scarce been fairer at my board and bed.&#151;<br> Another thing thou gav&#146;st me then,&#151;an oath<br> To do my bidding once, if lieve or loath<br> It were to thee. Now bring all to an end,<br> And slay the man who bears this&#151;once my friend,<br> And still too close unto my memory,<br> That on my skirts his treacherous blood should lie.<br> Take heed, though, that I say, myself, at whiles,<br> "The Gods are full of lies and luring smiles,<br> And know no faith." And this Bellerophon<br> May be a god; being even such an one<br> As seemeth kind beyond the wont of men,<br> Just and far-seeing, brave in those times when<br> Men's hearts grow sick with fear. Lo, such is he,<br> And yet a monster! He shall dwell with thee<br> Life-long, perchance; and once or twice Desire<br> Shall burn up all these things, as with a fire;<br> And he shall tread his kindness under foot,<br> And turn a liar e&#146;en from his heart's root,<br> And turn a wretched fool. Yea, what say I?<br> Turn a mere trembling coward, loth to die,<br> Rather than be all this. So take him, then,<br> While yet thou deem&#146;st him first of mortal men,<br> And in forefront of battle let him fall;</i> <A NAME="page_364"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 364</FONT></A><br> <i>Or, lonely, on some foeman's spear-swept wall,<br> If it may be;&#151;that he may leave behind<br> A savour, sweet in some men's mouths, nor find<br> That he has fallen to hell while yet he lives</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Such counsel to thee, friend, King Pr&#156;tus gives&#151;<br> A hapless man. But happy mayst thou dwell,<br> As thou shalt keep thy faith. Live hale and well!</i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not clear he saw these latter words of it,<br> For many a memory through his heart did flit,<br> Blinding his eyes belike: at last his head<br> He raised, and to the messenger he said:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Say to Jobates that I deem the man<br> Did even with his oath as such men can,<br> Who fear the Gods so much they may not tell<br> What gifts men give them. Say that all is well,<br> That I will take the gift he gave to me,<br> And long right sore that World's Desire to see."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the man went, and left Bellerophon<br> Pensive, and pondering on the days long gone<br> That brought him unto this: his happy love<br> The heart within him did to pity move;<br> He thought, "Alas! and can it ever be<br> That one can say, 'Thou art enough for me&#151;<br> And I, and I&#151;wilt thou not suffer it,<br> That I, at least, before thy feet may sit <A NAME="page_365"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 365</FONT></A><br> Until perchance I grow enough for thee?'<br> Alas, alas! and can it ever be<br> That thus a heart shall plead and plead, in vain?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did he murmur; but withal a strain<br> Of merry music made him lift his head<br> Slaying all thought of suffering folk or dead;<br> And even as a man new made a god,<br> When first he sets his foot upon the sod<br> Of Paradise, and like a living flame<br> Joy wraps him round, he felt, as now she came,<br> Clear won at last, the thing of all the earth<br> That made his fleeting life a little worth.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart faints now, my lips that tell the tale<br> Falter to think that such a life should fail;<br> That use, and long days dropping one by one,<br> As the wan water frets away the stone,<br> Should change desires of men, and what they bring,<br> E'er while their hearts with sickening longing cling<br> Unto the thought that they are still the same,<br> When all they were is grown an empty name.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Death-in-life, O sure pursuer, Change,<br> Be kind, be kind, and touch me not, till strange,<br> Changed too, thy face shows, when thy fellow Death<br> Delays no more to freeze my faltering breath! <A NAME="page_366"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 366</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>THE dull day long had faded into night<br> Ere all was done; taper and fire-light<br> Cast on the wall's fair painted images<br> Shadows confused of some, amidst of these,<br> The old men on the dais; down below<br> Amid the youths was stir and murmur now;<br> Some said they fain had known a little more<br> Of that Bellerophon ere all was o&#146;er;<br> Some said, that if the man lived, sure it was<br> That happiness of his would soon o&#146;erpass,<br> Because he kept back something of the stake:<br> Some said the story back their thoughts did take<br> To Argos, and the deeds there, and the end<br> Whereto the feet of Sthenob&#156;a did wend<br> So surely from the first, not without praise<br> Of some, they said: some wondered of the days<br> That Pr&#156;tus had, and if the godlike man<br> And he, who clung to joy as cowards can,<br> E'er met again, and what things they forgat<br> And what remembered, if it came to that.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one youth who had sat alone and sad,<br> While others friends and loves beside them had,<br> Rose up amid their talk, and slowly turned<br> To where the many lights that thereby burned<br> Scarce reached, and in that dimness walked awhile; <A NAME="page_367"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 367</FONT></A><br> And when he came back, with a quivering smile<br> On his sad face, gazed at the elders there,<br> As though he deemed his place among them were,<br> Who had nigh done with life; and one or two<br> Among the youths looked up, as if they knew<br> The pain that ailed him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many-peopled earth!<br> In foolish anger and in foolish mirth,<br> In causeless wars that never had an aim,<br> In worshipping the kings that bring thee shame,<br> In spreading lies that hide wrath in their breast,<br> In breaking up the short-lived days of rest,&#151;<br> &#151;In all thy folk care nought for, how they cling<br> Each unto each, fostering the foolish thing,<br> Nought worth, grown out of nought, that lightly lies<br> &#146;Twixt throat and lips, and yet works miseries!<br> While in this love that touches every one,<br> Still wilt thou let each man abide alone,<br> Unholpen, with his pain unnameable!<br> Is it, perchance, lest men should come to tell<br> Each unto other what a pain it is,<br> How little balanced by the sullied bliss<br> They win for some few minutes of their life,&#151;<br> Lest they die out and leave thee void of strife,<br> Empty of all their yearning and their fear,<br> &#146;Twixt storm and sunshine of thy changing year? <A NAME="page_368"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 368</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>LATE February days; and now, at last,<br> Might you have thought that winter's woe was past;<br> So fair the sky was, and so soft the air.<br> The happy birds were hurrying here and there,<br> As something soon would happen. Reddened now<br> The hedges, and in gardens many a bough<br> Was overbold of buds. Sweet days, indeed,<br> Although past road and bridge, through wood and mead,<br> Swift ran the brown stream, swirling by the grass,<br> And in the hill-side hollows snow yet was.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within sound of the city, yet amid<br> Patches of woodland that its white walls hid,<br> The house was, where the elders sat this tide,<br> The young folk with them; by the highway-side<br> The first starred yellow blossoms of the spring<br> Some held in hand; some came in, hurrying<br> From deeper in the woods, and now in fold<br> Of skirt and gown its treasures did they hold;<br> And soon to garland-making youth and maid<br> Were sat down: then the Swabian smiled, and said:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However it be that I, so old and grey,<br> A priest too, yet again must have to say <A NAME="page_369"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 369</FONT></A><br> More words of Venus, judge ye, maids: in sooth,<br> I, wandering once in long-past days of youth,<br> Came to the place my tale shall tell of now.<br> Vague tales, wherein I was well fain to trow,<br> Being dreamy and a youth, I oft had heard<br> Thereof, yet somewhat I did grow afeard<br> Before that cavern, although not alone<br> I was there, and the morn was such an one<br> As this fair morn has been: my fellow there<br> Was an old forester with thin white hair&#151;<br> Lo you, like mine now!&#151;but his deep-set eyes,<br> Bright mid his wrinkles, made him seem right wise&#151;<br> &#151;As I would fain seem, maidens.&#151;Ye may wot<br> That many a tale of that place had he got,<br> Because nearby, child boy and man, had he<br> Dwelt ever: so on a felled oaken tree<br> We sat beside the cave's mouth there of old,<br> While he this story, that I looked for, told.</p>
