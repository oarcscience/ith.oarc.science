<p><FONT SIZE="-1">THERE was a man in a certain great city who on his wedding- day unwittingly gave his spousal-ring to the Goddess Venus, and for this cause trouble came upon him, till in the end he got his ring back again.</FONT></p>  
<p>THE story of this chronicle<br> Doth of an ancient city tell,<br> Well built upon a goodly shore;<br> The wide lands stretched behind it bore<br> Great wealth of oil and wine and wheat;<br> The great sea carried to its feet<br> The dainty things of many lands;<br> There the hid miners&#146; toiling hands<br> Dragged up to light the dull blue lead,<br> And silver white, and copper red,<br> And dreadful iron; many a time<br> The sieves swung to the women's rhyme<br> O&#146;er gravelly streams that carried down<br> The golden sand from caves unknown;<br> Dark basalt o&#146;er the sea's beat stood,<br> And porphyry cliffs as red as blood;<br> From the white marble quarries' edge<br> Down to the sweeping river's sedge, <A NAME="page_181"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 181</FONT></A><br> Sheep bore the web that was to be;<br> The purple lay beneath the sea,<br> The madder waved in the light wind,<br> The woad-stalks did the peasant bind<br> That were to better his worn hood;<br> And ever, amid all things good,<br> Least of all things this lucky land<br> Lacked for the craftsman's cunning hand.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So richer grew that city still<br> Through many a year of good and ill,<br> And when the white beasts drew the car<br> That bore their banner to the war,<br> From out the brazen gates enwrought<br> With many a dreamer's steadfast thought,<br> An hundred thousand men poured out<br> To shake the scared earth with their shout.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now little will your wonder be<br> That mid so great prosperity<br> Enough there was of ill and sin;<br> That many folk who dwelt therein<br> Lived evil lives from day to day,<br> Nor put their worst desires away.<br> But as in otherwise indeed<br> Of God's good pardon had they need,<br> And were herein as other folk,<br> So must they bear this added yoke,<br> That rife was wicked sorcery there; <A NAME="page_182"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 182</FONT></A><br> And why I know not; if it were<br> Wrought by a lingering memory<br> Of how that land was wont to be<br> A dwelling-place, a great stronghold<br> Unto the cozening gods of old.<br> It might be so; but add thereto<br> That of all men life's sweets they knew,<br> That death to them was wholly bad,<br> So that perchance a hope they had<br> That yet another power there was<br> Than His who brought that death to pass.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Howe&#146;er that may be, this I know,<br> That in that land men's lives were so<br> That they in trouble still must turn<br> Unholy things and strange to learn:<br> Had this man mid the infidel<br> A lost son, folk might buy and sell;<br> Did that one fear to pass his life<br> With unrewarded love at strife;<br> Or had he a long-missing keel;<br> Or was he with the commonweal<br> In deadly strife; or perchance laid<br> Abed, by fever long downweighed;<br> Or were his riches well-nigh done;&#151;<br> Love, strife, or sickness, all was one,<br> This seemed the last resource to them,<br> To catch out at the strange-wrought hem<br> Of the dark gown that hid away <A NAME="page_183"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 183</FONT></A><br> The highest ill from light of day.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, though the word unspoken was,<br> And though each day the holy mass<br> At many an altar gold-arrayed<br> From out the painted book was said,<br> And though they doubted nought at all<br> Of how the day of days must fall<br> At last upon the earth, and range<br> All things aright that once seemed strange;<br> Yet Evil seemed so great a thing<br> That &#146;neath its dusk o&#146;ershadowing wing<br> They needs must cower down; now at least<br> While half a god and half a beast<br> Man seemed; some parley must they hold<br> With God's foe, nor be overbold<br> Before the threatening of a hand<br> Whose might they did not understand,<br> Though oftentimes they felt it sore:<br> And through this faithlessness, the more<br> Ill things had power there, as I deem,<br> Till some men's lives were like a dream,<br> Where nought in order can be set,<br> And nought worth thence the soul may get,<br> Or weigh one thing for what it is;<br> Yea, at the best mid woe and bliss,<br> Some dreamlike day would come to most.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this great city still made boast<br> That, mid her merchant's, men there were <A NAME="page_184"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 184</FONT></A><br> Who e&#146;en from kings the bell might bear<br> For wealth and honour: and I think<br> That no men richer wines might drink,<br> Were better housed, or braver clad,<br> Or more of all the world's joy had<br> Than their rich men; that no king's door<br> Could show forth greater crowds of poor,<br> Who lacked for bread and all things good,<br> Than in that land a merchant's could&#151;<br> Yea, rich indeed &#146;mongst all were they.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now on a certain summer day<br> One of their fairest palaces,<br> A paradise midst whispering trees,<br> Beyond its wont was bright and fair;<br> Great feast did men get ready there,<br> Because its young lord, lately come<br> Back from the eastlands to his home,<br> That day should wed a lovely maid;<br> He, for that tide too long delayed,<br> A lading of great rarities<br> Had brought to dazzle those sweet eyes;<br> So had you wandered through the house<br> From hall to chamber amorous,<br> While in the minster church hard by,<br> Mid incense smoke and psalmody,<br> The gold-clad priest made one of twain,<br> So wandering had you tried in vain<br> To light on an uncomely thing; <A NAME="page_185"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 185</FONT></A><br> Such dyes as stain the parrot's wing,<br> The May-flowers or the evening sky,<br> Made bright the silken tapestry;<br> And threaded pearls therein were wrought,<br> And emeralds from far eastlands brought<br> To deck the shapes of knight and king;&#151;<br> His maybe who of old did sing<br> God's praises &#146;twixt the shield and spear,<br> Or his the Trojan folk did fear.<br> Or from the silken mimicry<br> Of fair Cassandra might you see<br> Oileus the red ruby tear,<br> As he her snowy breast made bare;<br> Since woe itself must there be sweet<br> For such a place to be made meet.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If such things hid the marble walls,<br> What wonder that the swift footfalls<br> Were dulled upon the marble floor<br> By silken webs from some far shore,<br> Whereon were pictured images<br> Of other beasts and other trees<br> And other birds than these men knew;<br> That from the vaulted ceilings&#146; blue<br> Stars shone like Dana&euml;'s coming shower,<br> Or that some deftly painted bower<br> Thence mocked the roses of that day?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full many a life had passed away,<br> And many a once young hand grown old, <A NAME="page_186"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 186</FONT></A><br> Dealing with silk and gems and gold,<br> Through weary days and anxious nights,<br> That went to fashion those delights,<br> Which added now small bliss indeed<br> To those who pleasure had to meed<br> Upon a day when all were glad:<br> Yet when the Church all dues had had,<br> And the street, filled with minstrelsy,<br> Gave token of the twain anigh;<br> When through the hall-doors, open wide,<br> Streamed in the damsels of the bride;<br> When the tall brown-cheeked bridegroom came<br> Flushed with hot love and pride and shame,<br> And by the hand his love led on,<br> Who midst that glorious company shone<br> Like some piece of the pale moonlight<br> Cut off from quietness and night,&#151;<br> Then all these dainty things in sooth<br> Seemed meet for such an hour of youth;<br> And vain were words such joy to stay;<br> And deathless seemed that little day,<br> And as a fitful hapless dream<br> The past and future well might seem.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What need to tell how sea and earth<br> Had been run through to make more mirth,<br> For folk already overglad&#151;<br> What cunning pageants there they had;<br> What old tales acted o&#146;er again, <A NAME="page_187"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 187</FONT></A><br> Where grief and death glad folk did feign,<br> Who deemed their own joy still would bide;<br> What old songs sung wherein did hide<br> Meet meanings for that lovesome day;<br> What singing of the bridal lay<br> By a fair, soft-voiced trembling maid,<br> Like to the Goddess well arrayed,<br> Who, dreaded once, was grown to be<br> A pageant-maker's imagery?<br> Why make long words of that sweet band<br> Who scattered flowers from slender hand,<br> And brought the garlands forth? How tell<br> What music on the feasters fell,<br> So sweet and solemn, that from mirth<br> O&#146;erstrained well-nigh must tears have birth?&#151;<br> Nay, let all pass, and deem indeed<br> That every joyance was their meed<br> Wherewith men cheat themselves to think<br> That they of endless joy may drink;<br> That every sense in turn must bear<br> Of o&#146;er-sweet pleasure its full share,<br> Till for awhile the very best<br> They next might gain seemed utter rest,<br> And of some freshness were they fain.<br> So then the garden did they gain,<br> And wandered there by twos and threes<br> Amidst the flowers, or &#146;neath the trees,<br> Sat, keeping troublous thoughts at bay. <A NAME="page_188"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 188</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So fared they through the earlier day;<br> But when the sun did now decline,<br> And men grew graver for the wine<br> That erst such noble tales had told;<br> And maids no more were free and bold,<br> But reddened at the words half-said,<br> While round about the rebecks played;<br> Then needs must the feastmasters strive<br> Too pensive thoughts away to drive,<br> And make the sun go down with mirth<br> At least upon that spot of earth;<br> So did the minstrel men come in,<br> And tale-tellers the lay begin,<br> And men by fabled woes were stirred,<br> Or smiling their own follies heard<br> Told of some other; and withal<br> Here did the dice on table fall,<br> Here stout in arms the chess-king stood;<br> There young men stirred their sluggish blood<br> With clattering sword and buckler play,<br> There others on the daisies lay<br> Above the moat, and watched their quill<br> Make circles in the water still,<br> Or laughed to see the damsel hold<br> Her dainty skirt enwrought with gold<br> Back from the flapping tench's tail,<br> Or to his close-set dusky mail<br> With gentle force brought laughingly<br> The shrinking finger-tip anigh. <A NAME="page_189"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 189</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midst these abode a little knot<br> Of youths and maidens, on a spot<br> Fenced by a cloister of delight,<br> Well wrought of marble green and white;<br> Wherein upon a wall of gold<br> Of Tristram was the story told,<br> Well done by cunning hands that knew<br> What form to man and beast was due;<br> Midmost, upon a space of green,<br> Half shaded from the summer sheen,<br> Half with the afternoon sun thrown<br> Upon its daisies glittering strewn,<br> Was gathered that fair company<br> Wherewith the bridegroom chanced to be,<br> Who through the cloister door must gaze<br> From time to time &#146;thwart the sun's blaze<br> On to a shaded space of grass<br> Whereon his new-wed maiden was,<br> Hearkening in seeming to a song<br> That told of some past love and wrong;<br> But as he strained his ear to catch<br> Across the wind some louder snatch<br> Of the sweet tune, new-coming folk<br> The sweet sight hid, the music broke;<br> Of these one maiden trimly girt<br> Bore in her gleaming upheld skirt<br> Fair silken balls sewed round with gold;<br> Which when the others did behold<br> Men cast their mantles unto earth, <A NAME="page_190"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 190</FONT></A><br> And maids within their raiments&#146; girth<br> Drew up their gown-skirts, loosening here<br> Some button on their bosoms clear<br> Or slender wrists, there making tight<br> The laces round their ankles light;<br> For folk were wont within that land<br> To cast the ball from hand to hand,<br> Dancing meanwhile full orderly;<br> So now the bridegroom with a sigh,<br> Struggling with love's quick-gathering yoke,<br> Turned round unto that joyous folk,<br> And gat him ready for the play.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely to look on was the sway<br> Of the slim maidens &#146;neath the ball<br> As they swung back to note its fall<br> With dainty balanced feet; and fair<br> The bright outflowing golden hair,<br> As swiftly, yet in measured wise<br> One maid ran forth to gain the prize;<br> Eyes glittered and young cheeks glowed bright,<br> And gold-shod foot, round limb and light,<br> Gleamed from beneath the girded gown<br> That, unrebuked, untouched, was thrown<br> Hither and thither by the breeze;<br> Shrill, laughter smote the thick-leaved trees,<br> Familiar names clear voices cried,<br> Sweet sound rose up as sweet sound died,<br> And still the circle spread and spread, <A NAME="page_191"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 191</FONT></A><br> As folk to all that goodlihead<br> Kept thronging in, till they must stay<br> A little while the eager play,<br> And now, for very breathlessness,<br> With rest the trodden daisies bless.<br> So now against the wall some leaned,<br> Some from amidst the daisies gleaned<br> The yellow trefoil, and the blue<br> Faint speedwell in the shade that grew;<br> Some panting sat and clasped their knees<br> With faces turned unto the breeze,<br> And midst them the new-corners stood,<br> With hair smooth yet and unstirred blood.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence, the bridegroom, as the game<br> Unto this tide of resting came,<br> Turned idle eyes about, and met<br> An image in the grey wall set,<br> A thing he knew from early days:<br> There in a gilded carven place<br> Queen Venus&#146; semblance stood, more fair<br> Than women whom that day did bear,<br> And yet a marvel for the life<br> Wherewith its brazen limbs were rife.<br> Not in that country was she wrought,<br> Or in those days; she had been brought<br> From a fair city far away,<br> Ruined e&#146;en then for many a day;<br> Full many a tale had there been told <A NAME="page_192"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 192</FONT></A><br> Of him who once that Queen did mould,<br> And all of these were strange to hear,<br> And dreadful some, and full of fear.<br> And now as Laurence gazed upon<br> That beauty, in the old days won<br> He knew not from what pain and toil,<br> Vague fear new-risen-up seemed to spoil<br> The summer joy; her loveliness<br> That hearts, long dead now, once did bless,<br> Grown dangerous, &#146;gan to lead his mind<br> On through a troublous maze and blind<br> Of unnamed thoughts, and silently,<br> With knitted brow, he drew anigh,<br> And midst the babbling close did gaze<br> Into the marvel of her face:<br> Till, with a sudden start, at last<br> His straying thoughts he seemed to cast<br> Aside, and laughed aloud, and said:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"O cold and brazen goodlihead,<br> How lookest thou on those that live?<br> Thou who, tales say, wert wont to strive<br> On earth, in heaven, and &#146;neath the earth,<br> To wrap all in thy net of mirth,<br> And drag them down to misery<br> Past telling&#151;and didst thou know why?&#151;<br> And what has God done with thee then,<br> That thou art perished from midst men<br> E&#146;en as the things thou didst destroy, <A NAME="page_193"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 193</FONT></A><br> Thy Paris and thy town of Troy,<br> And many a man and maid and town?<br> How is thy glory fallen adown,<br> That I, even I, must sigh for thee!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So spake he, as the minstrelsy<br> Struck up once more a joyous strain,<br> And called them to the play again;<br> And therewithal he looked about,<br> In answer to the merry shout<br> That called on him by name to turn.<br> But even therewith the sun did burn<br> Upon his new-gained spousal-ring&#151;<br> A wondrous work, a priceless thing,<br> Whereon, &#146;neath mulberries white and red,<br> And green leaves, lay fair Thisbe dead<br> By her dead love; the low sun's blaze<br> It caught now, and he fell to gaze<br> Thereon, and said at last:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Perchance<br> The ball might break it in the dance,<br> And that an ugly omen were;<br> Nay, one to ward it well is here.<br> Thou, Goddess, that heardst Thisbe's vow,<br> From blind eyes gaze upon her now<br> Till I return mine own to claim;<br> And as thou mayst, bear thou the shame<br> Of being the handmaid to my love;<br> Full sure I am thou wilt not move." <A NAME="page_194"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 194</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know that this image there did stand<br> With arm put forth and open hand,<br> As erst on Ida triumphing;<br> And now did Laurence set the ring<br> On the fourth finger fair and straight,<br> And laughing, "Thou mayst bear the weight,"<br> Turned back again unto the play.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To him slow passed the time away;<br> But when at last in purple shade<br> &#146;Twixt wall and wall the grass was laid,<br> And he grew gladder therewithal,<br> Then weariness on folk &#146;gan fall;<br> The fifes left off their dancing tune,<br> And sang of lovers fain of June,<br> And thence that company &#146;gan go<br> By twos and threes with footsteps slow,<br> Pensive at end of mirthful day;<br> But from them Laurence turned away<br> Unto the carven dame, to take<br> The ring he wore for true-love's sake;&#151;<br> Daylight it was, though broad and red<br> The sun was grown, and shadows led<br> Eastward with long lines o&#146;er the grass&#151;<br> &#151;Daylight, but what had come to pass?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearby those voices still he heard<br> In laugh and talk and careless word;<br> Upon his cheek the wind blew cold;<br> His own fair house he did behold <A NAME="page_195"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 195</FONT></A><br> Changed nowise; from the little close<br> The scent of trodden grass arose&#151;<br> How could it be a dream?&#151;Yet there<br> She stood, the moveless image fair,<br> The little-noticed, oft-seen thing,<br> With hand fast closed upon his ring.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, in agony and haste,<br> A frantic minute did he waste<br> In pulling at the brazen hand,<br> That was as firm as rocks that stand<br> The day-long beating of the sea;<br> Then did he reel back dizzily,<br> And gaze at sky and earth and trees<br> Once more, as asking words from these<br> To ravel out his tale for him.<br> But now as they were waxing dim<br> Before his eyes, he heard his name<br> Called out, and therewith fear of shame<br> Brought back his heart and made him man.<br> Unto his fellows, pale and wan,<br> He turned, who, when they saw him so,<br> What thing might ail him fain would know,<br> For wild and strange he looked indeed;<br> Then stammered he, "Nay, nought I need<br> But wine, in sooth: John, mind&#146;st thou not<br> How on the steaming shore and hot<br> Of Serendib a sting I gat<br> From some unseen worm, as we sat <A NAME="page_196"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 196</FONT></A><br> Feasting one eve? Well, the black folk<br> E&#146;en saved my life from that ill stroke,<br> By leech-craft; yet they told me then<br> I oft should feel that wound again,<br> Till I had fifty years or more:<br> This is a memory of that shore;<br> A thing to be right soon forgot."<br> And to himself, "If this is not<br> An empty dream, a cutting file<br> My ring therefrom shall soon beguile,<br> When, at the ending of the day,<br> These wearying guests have gone away."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now unto supper all folk turned,<br> And &#146;neath the torches red gold burned,<br> And the best pageants of the day<br> Swept through the hall and said their say,<br> Departing e&#146;en as men's lives go:<br> But though to Laurence slow and slow<br> Those hours must needs seem, none the less<br> He gave himself to mirthfulness,<br> At least in seeming; till at last<br> All guests from out the palace passed.<br> And now the short soft summer night<br> Was left at peace for their delight;<br> But Laurence, muffled up and hid,<br> Shrinking, betwixt his servants slid,<br> For now he had a little space<br> To come unto that mystic place, <A NAME="page_197"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 197</FONT></A><br> Where still his ring he thought to see.<br> A file and chisel now had he,<br> And weighty hammer; yet withal<br> As he drew toward the cloister-wall,<br> Well-nigh he called himself a fool,<br> To go with cloak and blacksmith's tool,<br> And lay hard blows upon a dream;<br> For now in sooth he nigh must deem<br> His eyes had mocked him; reaching soon<br> That cloister by the broad high moon<br> He hurried through the door, and heard<br> All round the sound of June's brown bird<br> Above the voices of the night;<br> Trembling, he sprang into the light<br> Through the black arches of the place,<br> And stealing on stood face to face<br> With the old smiling image there,<br> And lowered to her fingers fair<br> His troubled, wild, and shrinking eyes,<br> And stretched his hand out to the prize:&#151;<br> His eyes, his hand, were there in vain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more, as sure of coming gain,<br> As erst in Ida she did stand,<br> So stood she now; her open hand,<br> That late he saw closed round the ring,<br> Empty and bare of anything:<br> Gaping awhile he stood, for fear<br> Now made him think a voice to hear, <A NAME="page_198"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 198</FONT></A><br> And see her change soon, and depart<br> From out her midst; but gathering heart,<br> He muttered, "Yet, what have I seen?<br> Should it not even thus have been,<br> If the closed hand was but a dream?<br> Of some guest worser must I deem;<br> Go, fool; thine own love waiteth thee."<br> Therewith he went, yet fearfully<br> Looked o&#146;er his shoulder on the way,<br> And terror on his heart still lay.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet to his chamber at the last<br> He came, and to the floor he cast<br> His wrapping mantle, and alone<br> He strove to think of all things done,<br> And strove once more to bring again<br> The longing sweet, the joy and pain<br> That on that morn he called desire;<br> For wretched fear had dulled that fire:<br> And, whereas erewhile he had deemed<br> That life was joy, and it had seemed<br> A never-ending game to be,<br> A fair and rich eternity<br> Before him, now was it indeed<br> A troublous fight, where he should need<br> Help on the left hand and the right,<br> Nor yet so &#146;scape the certain night.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But mid these thoughts he heard withal<br> The chamberlain to pages call, <A NAME="page_199"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 199</FONT></A><br> To bear the bridal wine to him;<br> And as he might he strove to dim<br> His anxious thought, and with a smile<br> The coming curious eyes beguile.<br> They entered now, and whiles that he<br> Drank from the gold cup feverishly,<br> The minstrels, ere his draught was done,<br> Struck up <i>The King of England's Son</i>,<br> And soon amid that ordered word<br> The lessening sound of feet he heard,<br> And then the song itself must die.<br> But from the bridechamber nearby<br> Now for a space rose clear and sweet<br> The damsels&#146; song, <i>Fair Marguerite;</i><br> And when that ended all was still,<br> And he with strained, divided will,<br> Trembling with love, yet pale with fear,<br> To the bridechamber door drew near,<br> Muttering some well-remembered charm<br> That erst had kept his soul from harm.<br> Yet misty seemed the place; the wall&#151;<br> Its woven waters seemed to fall,<br> Its trees, its beasts, its loom-wrought folk,<br> Now seemed indeed as though they woke,<br> And moved unto him as he went.<br> The room seemed full of some strange scent;<br> And strains of wicked songs he heard,<br> And half-said God-denying word:<br> He reeled, and cried aloud, and strove <A NAME="page_200"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 200</FONT></A><br> To gain the door that hid his love;<br> It seemed to him that, were he there,<br> All would again be calm and fair.<br> But in the way before his eyes<br> A cloudy column seemed to rise,<br> Cold, odorous, impalpable,<br> And a voice cried, "<i>I love thee well,<br> And thou hast loved me ere to-night,<br> And longed for this o&#146;ergreat delight,<br> And had no words therefor to pray.<br> Come, have thy will, and cast away<br> Thy foolish fear, thy foolish love,<br> Since me at least thou canst not move,<br> Now thou with ring hast wedded me:<br> Come, cast the hope away from thee<br> Wherewith unhappy brooding men<br> Must mock their threescore years and ten;<br> Come, thou that mockest me, I live!<br> How with my beauty canst thou strive?<br> Unhappy if thou couldst! for see<br> What depth of joy there is in me!</i>"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then round about him closed the mist;<br> It was as though his lips were kissed,<br> His body by soft arms embraced,<br> His fingers lovingly enlaced<br> By other fingers; until he<br> Midst darkness his own ring did see.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nought else awhile; then back there came <A NAME="page_201"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 201</FONT></A><br> New vision: as amidst white flame,<br> The flower-girt goddess wavered there,<br> Nor knew he now where they twain were,<br> Midst wild desire that nigh did rend<br> His changed heart; then there came an end<br> Of all that light and ecstasy;<br> His soul grew blind, his eyes could see;<br> And, moaning from an empty heart,<br> He saw the hangings blown apart<br> By the night wind, the lights flare red<br> In the white light the high moon shed<br> O&#146;er all the place he knew so well,<br> And senseless on the floor he fell.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>AH, what a night to what a morn!<br> Ah, what a morrow black with scorn,<br> And hapless end of happy love!<br> What shame his helpless shame to prove!<br> For who, indeed, alone could bear<br> The dreadful shame, the shameful fear,<br> Of such a bridal? Think withal,<br> More trusted such a tale would fall<br> Upon those folks' ears than on most,<br> Who, as I said erst, saw a host<br> Of wild things lurking in the night;<br> To whom was magic much as right<br> As prayers or holy psalmody. <A NAME="page_202"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 202</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So nothing else it seemed might be,<br> When Laurence for three nights had striven<br> To gain the fair maid to him given,<br> But that her sire should know the thing<br> And help him with his counselling.<br> So, weary, wasted with his shame,<br> Unto his house the bridegroom came,<br> And when the twain were left alone<br> He told him how the thing had gone.<br> The old man doubted not the sooth<br> Of what he said, but, touched with ruth,<br> Yet spent no time in mourning vain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Son," said he, "idle were the pain<br> To seek if thou some deed hast wrought<br> Which on thine head this grief hath brought&#151;<br> Some curse for which this doth atone,<br> Some laugh whereby is honour gone<br> From the dread powers unnameable:<br> Rather, who now can help thee well?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Small heed, my father," Laurence said,<br> "Gave I to such things, and small dread<br> To anything I could not see,<br> But it were God who fashioned me:<br> From witch-wives have I bought ere now<br> Wind-bags indeed, but yet did trow<br> Nothing therein, but dealt with these<br> My shipmen's clamour to appease." <A NAME="page_203"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 203</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," said he, "that perchance is worse<br> For thee, yea, may have gained this curse.<br> But come, I know a certain man<br> Who in these things great marvels can,<br> And something of an age are we,<br> Yoke-fellows in astronomy&#151;<br> &#160;A many years agone, alas!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So therewithal the twain did pass<br> Toward the great church, and entered there,<br> And, going &#146;twixt the pillars fair,<br> Came to a chapel, where a priest<br> Made ready now the Holy Feast:<br> "Hist," said the old man, "there he is;<br> May he find healing for all this!<br> Kneel down, and note him not too much,<br> No easy man he is to touch."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So down upon the floor of stone<br> They knelt, until the mass was done,<br> Midst peasant folk, and sailors&#146; wives,<br> Sore careful for their husbands&#146; lives;<br> But when the mass was fully o&#146;er<br> They made good haste unto the door<br> That led unto the sacristy:<br> And there a ring right fair to see<br> The old man to a verger gave<br> In token, praying much to have<br> With Dan Palumbus speech awhile:<br> The verger took it with a smile, <A NAME="page_204"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 204</FONT></A><br> As one who says, 'Ye ask in vain;'<br> But presently he came again,<br> And said, "Fair sir, come hither then,<br> The priest will see you of all men!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With eyes made grave by their intent<br> From out the lordly church they went<br> Into the precinct, and withal<br> They passed along the minster wall,<br> And heard amid the buttresses<br> The grey hawks chatter to the breeze,<br> The sanctus bell run down the wind;<br> Until the priest's house did they find,<br> Built &#146;neath the belfry huge and high,<br> Fluttered about perpetually<br> By chattering daws, and shaken well<br> From roof to pavement, when the bell<br> Flung out its sound o&#146;er night or day.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sirs, Dan Palumbus takes his way<br> E&#146;en now from out the sacristy,"<br> The verger said, "sirs, well be ye!<br> For time it is that I were gone."<br> Therewith he left the twain alone<br> Beside the door, and, sooth to say,<br> In haste he seemed to get away<br> As one afeard; but they bode there,<br> And round about the house did peer,<br> But found nought dreadful: small it was,<br> Set on a tiny plot of grass, <A NAME="page_205"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 205</FONT></A><br> And on each side the door a bay<br> Brushed &#146;gainst the oak porch rent and grey;<br> A yard-wide garden ran along<br> The wall, by ancient box fenced strong;<br> And in the corner, where it met<br> The belfry, was a great yew set,<br> Where sat the blackbird-hen in spring,<br> Hearkening her bright-billed husband sing.<br> A peaceful place it should have been<br> For one who of the world had seen<br> O&#146;er much, and quiet watch would keep<br> Over his soul awaiting sleep.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now they heard the priest draw nigh,<br> And saw him and his shadow high<br> Wind round the wind-worn buttresses;<br> So coming by the last of these<br> He met them face to face: right tall<br> He was; his straight black hair did fall<br> About his shoulders; strong he seemed,<br> His eyes look far off, as he dreamed<br> Of other things than what they saw;<br> Strange lines his thin pale face did draw<br> Into a set wild look of pain<br> And terror. As he met the twain<br> He greeted well his ancient friend,<br> And prayed them within doors to wend.<br> Small was his chamber; books were there<br> Right many, and in seeming fair. <A NAME="page_206"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 206</FONT></A><br> But who knows what therein might be<br> &#146;Twixt board and board of oaken tree?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Palumbus bade them sit, and sat,<br> And talked apace of this and that,<br> Nor heeded that the youth spake wild,<br> Nor that his old friend coughed and smiled,<br> As ill at ease, while the priest spake,<br> Then from his cloak a purse did take,<br> And at the last pushed in his word<br> Edgewise, as &#146;twere. Palumbus heard<br> As one who fain had been born deaf,<br> Then rose and cried, "Thou fill&#146;st the sheaf,<br> Thou fill&#146;st the sheaf! this is my doom,<br> Well may the sexton make my tomb!"<br> And up and down he walked, muttering,<br> &#146;Twixt closed teeth, many a nameless thing.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last he stopped and said, "O ye,<br> I knew that ye would come to me,<br> And offer me great store of gold:<br> Full often good help have I sold,<br> And thus this tide should I have done;<br> But on this mountain of grey stone<br> I stood last night, and in my art<br> I dealt; and terror filled my heart,<br> And hope, and great uncertainty;<br> Therefore I deem that I shall die;<br> For cool and bold erst have I been, <A NAME="page_207"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 207</FONT></A><br> Whatever I have heard and seen;<br> But the old Master of my fear<br> Seems afar now, and God grown near;<br> And soon I look to see his face.<br> Therefore, if but for a short space,<br> Would I be on his side, and do<br> A good deed; all the more for you;<br> Since thou art part of sweet days, friend,<br> That once we deemed would never end;<br> And in thine eyes meseems, O youth,<br> Kindness I see and hope and truth;<br> And thou and he may speak a word<br> For me unto my master's Lord:&#151;<br> Well, I must reap that I did sow&#151;<br> But take your gold again and go:<br> And thou for six days fast and pray,<br> And come here on the seventh day<br> About nightfall; then shalt thou learn<br> In what way doth the matter turn,<br> And fully know of time and place,<br> And be well armed thy foe to face."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So homeward doubtful went the twain,<br> And Laurence spent in fear and pain<br> The six long days; and so at last,<br> When the seventh sun was well-nigh past,<br> Came to that dark man's fair abode;<br> The grey tower with the sunset glowed,<br> The daws wheeled black against the sky <A NAME="page_208"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 208</FONT></A><br> About the belfry windows high,<br> Or here and there one sank adown<br> The dizzy shaft of panelled stone;<br> And sound of children nigh the close<br> Was mingled with the cries of those;<br> And e&#146;en as Laurence laid his hand<br> Upon the latch, and there did stand<br> Lingering a space, most startling clear<br> The sweet chime filled the evening air.<br> He entered mid the great bell's drone,<br> And found Palumbus all alone<br> Mid books laid open:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rest," said he;<br> "Time presses not for thee or me:<br> Surely shall I die soon enow."<br> Silent, with hands laid to his brow,<br> He sat then, nor did Laurence speak,<br> Fearing perchance some spell to break:<br> At last the priest caught up a book,<br> And from its leaves a letter took,<br> And unknown words there were on it<br> For superscription duly writ,<br> And sealed it was in solemn wise.<br> He said:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou knowest where there lies<br> Five leagues hence, or a little less,<br> North of the town, a sandy ness<br> That shipmen call St. Clement's Head;<br> South of it dreary land and dead <A NAME="page_209"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 209</FONT></A><br> Lies stretched now, and the sea bears o&#146;er<br> Ruin of shingle evermore,<br> And saps the headland year by year,<br> And long have husbandmen had fear<br> Of its short-lived and treacherous soil,<br> And left it free from any toil.<br> There, with thy face turned toward the rand,<br> At the hill's foot take thou thy stand,<br> Just where the turf the shingle meets,<br> Wherewith the sea the marshland eats;<br> But seaward if thy face thou turn,<br> What I have learned then shalt thou learn<br> With like reward&#151;watch carefully<br> And well, and a strange company<br> Shall pass thee as thou standest there,<br> And heed thee not&#151;some foul some fair,<br> Some glad some sorry; rule thy heart,<br> And heed them nothing for thy part,<br> Till at the end of all thou seest<br> A great lord on a marvellous beast<br> Unnameable; on him cry out,<br> And he thereon shall turn about<br> And ask thy need; have thou no fear,<br> But give him what I give thee here,<br> And let him read, and thou shalt win<br> Thine happiness, and have no sin.<br> But as for me, be witness thou<br> That in the scroll I give thee now,<br> My death lies, and I know it well, <A NAME="page_210"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 210</FONT></A><br> And cry to God against his hell."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In languid voice he spake as one,<br> Who knows the task that must be done,<br> And how each word from him should fall,<br> And gives no heed to it at all;<br> But here he stopped a little space,<br> And once more covered up his face;<br> But soon began his speech again<br> In a soft voice, and freed from pain:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And for the folk that thou shalt see,<br> Whence cometh all that company,&#151;<br> Marvel thou not thereat, for know<br> That this is sure; long years ago,<br> Leagues seaward of that barren place,<br> The temple of a glorious race,<br> Built with far mightier walls than these,<br> Stood fair midst groves of whispering trees.<br> Thence come these folk remembering<br> Their glory once so great a thing&#151;<br> I have said: 'Could they be once more<br> As they have been,&#151;but all is o&#146;er,<br> What matters what is, what has been,<br> And what shall be, when I have seen<br> The last few hours of my last day?-<br> Depart.&#151;Ah me, to cast away<br> Such power as I on earth have had!<br> I who could make the lover glad<br> Above his love's dead face,&#151;at least <A NAME="page_211"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 211</FONT></A><br> A little while&#151;now has all ceased<br> With that small scrap of black and white:<br> Think of me, God, midst thy delight,<br> And save me! yea, or do thy will!<br> For thou too hast beheld my skill."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scroll did Laurence hold in hand,<br> And silent he a space did stand,<br> Gazing upon Palumbus, who<br> Sat open-eyed, as though he knew<br> Nought of what things were round about;<br> So, stealthily, and in great doubt<br> Of strange things yet to come to pass,<br> Did Laurence gain the darkening grass,<br> And through the precinct and the town<br> He passed, and reached the foreshores brown,<br> And gathered heart, and as he might<br> Went boldly forward through the night.<br> At first on his left hand uprose<br> Great cliffs and sheer, and, rent from those,<br> Boulders strewn thick across the strand,<br> Made weary work for foot and hand;<br> But well he knew the path indeed,<br> And scarce of such light had he need<br> As still the summer eve might shed<br> From the high stars or sunset dead.<br> Soft was the lovely time and fair,<br> A little sea-wind raised his hair,<br> That seemed as though from heaven it blew. <A NAME="page_212"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 212</FONT></A><br> All sordid thoughts the sweet time slew,<br> And gave good hope such welcoming,<br> That presently he &#146;gan to sing,<br> Though still amid the quiet night<br> He could not hear his song aright<br> For the grave thunder of the sea<br> That smote the beach so musically,<br> And in the dim light seemed so soft<br> As each great wave was raised aloft<br> To fall in foam, you might have deemed<br> That waste of ocean was but dreamed,<br> And that the surf's strong music was<br> By some unknown thing brought to pass;<br> And Laurence, singing as he went,<br> As in some lower firmament,<br> Beneath the line that marked where met<br> The world's roof and the highway wet,<br> Could see a ship's light gleam afar<br> Scarce otherwise than as a star,<br> While o&#146;erhead fields of thin white cloud<br> The more part of the stars did shroud.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So on he went, and here and there<br> A few rough fisher-caries there were,<br> Launching their ordered keels to sea<br> Eager to gain, if it might be,<br> The harbour-mouth with morning-light,<br> Or else some bird that flies by night<br> Wheeled round about with his harsh cry; <A NAME="page_213"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 213</FONT></A><br> Or as the cliffs sank he could spy<br> Afar some homestead glittering<br> With high feast or some other thing.<br> Such gleams of fellowship had he<br> At first along the unquiet sea,<br> But when a long way off the town<br> The cliffs were wholly sunken down,<br> And on the marshland's edge he went,<br> For all sounds then the night-jar sent<br> Its melancholy laugh across<br> The sea-wind moaning for the loss<br> Of long-drowned lands, that in old time<br> Were known for great in many a clime.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the moon rose, and &#146;neath its light,<br> Cloud-barred, the wide wastes came in sight,<br> With gleaming, sand-choked, reed-clad pools,<br> And marsh-lights for the mock of fools;<br> And o&#146;er the waste beneath the moon<br> The sea-wind piped a dreary tune,<br> And louder grew, and the world then<br> No more seemed made for sons of men,<br> And summer seemed an empty name,<br> And harvest-time a mock and shame:<br> Such hopeless ruin seemed settled there,<br> On acres sunny once and fair.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Laurence now could well behold<br> The sandy headland bare and bold <A NAME="page_214"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 214</FONT></A><br> Against the sea, and stayed his feet<br> Awhile, to think how he should meet<br> These nameless things, his enemies,<br> The lords of terror and disease;<br> Then trembling, hastened on, for thought<br> Full many an image to him brought,<br> Once seen, with loathing cast aside,<br> But ready e&#146;en for such a tide,<br> Come back with longing's added sting,<br> And whatso horrors time could bring.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now thrusting all these thoughts apart<br> He hastened on with hardy heart,<br> Till on the doubtful place he stood<br> Where the sea sucked the pasture's blood,<br> And with back turned unto the sea<br> He strove to think right strenuously<br> Of this and that well-liking place;<br> The merry clamour of the chase,<br> Pageant of soldier or of priest,<br> Or market-place or crowded feast,<br> Or splintered spears for ladies' sake,<br> Until he &#146;gan to dream awake:<br> Then, midst of all his striving, still<br> His happiest thoughts must turn to ill,<br> As in a fevered, restless dream.<br> He thought about some flowery stream,<br> Himself in gilded boat thereon&#151;<br> A livid cloud came o&#146;er the sun,<br> A great wave swept from bank to bank; <A NAME="page_215"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 215</FONT></A><br> Or flower-crowned amid friends he drank,<br> And as he raised the red wine up<br> Fell poison shrieked from out the cup;<br> The garland when his heart was full<br> He set upon a fleshless skull;<br> The lute turned to a funeral bell,<br> The golden door led down to hell.<br> Then back from dreams his soul he brought,<br> And of his own ill matters thought,<br> And found his fear the lesser grew<br> When all his heart therein he threw.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet awful was the time indeed,<br> And of good heart sore had he need:<br> The wind's moan louder than before,<br> Some wave cast higher up the shore,<br> The night-bird's brushing past his head,&#151;<br> All little things grew full of dread;<br> Yet did he waver nought at all,<br> Or turn, for whatso thing might fall.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon was growing higher now,<br> The east wind had been strong to blow<br> The night sky clear from vexing cloud,<br> And in the west his flock did crowd;<br> Sharper things grew beneath the light,<br> As with a false dawn; thin and bright<br> The horned poppies&#146; blossoms shone<br> Upon a shingle-bank, thrust on <A NAME="page_216"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 216</FONT></A><br> By the high tide to choke the grass;<br> And nigh it the sea-holly was,<br> Whose cold grey leaves and stiff stark shade<br> On earth a double moonlight made:<br> Above him, specked with thorn and whin,<br> And clad with short grey grass and thin,<br> The hill ran up, and Laurence knew<br> That down the other slope there grew<br> A dark pine-wood, whose added sound<br> Scarce noted, yet did more confound,<br> With changing note, his wearied mind.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But now with drowsiness grown blind,<br> Once more he tottered on his place,<br> And let fall down his weary face;<br> But then remembering all his part,<br> Once and again woke with a start,<br> And dozed again; and then at last,<br> Shuddering, all slumber from him cast,<br> Yet scarce knew if he lived or no:<br> For by his scared wild eyes did go<br> A wondrous pageant, noiselessly,<br> Although so close it passed him by;<br> The fluttering raiment by him brushed,<br> As through its folds the sea-wind rushed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By then his eyes were opened wide.<br> Already up the grey hill-side<br> The backs of two were turned to him: <A NAME="page_217"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 217</FONT></A><br> One like a young man tall and slim,<br> Whose heels with rosy wings were dight;<br> One like a woman clad in white,<br> With glittering wings of many a hue,<br> Still changing, and whose shape none knew.<br> In aftertime would Laurence say,<br> That though the moonshine, cold and grey,<br> Flooded the lonely earth that night,<br> These creatures in the moon's despite<br> Were coloured clear, as though the sun<br> Shone through the earth to light each one,<br> And terrible was that to see.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while he stood, and shudderingly<br> Still gazed on those departing twain,<br> Yet &#146;gan to gather heart again,<br> A noise like echoes of a shout<br> Seemed in the cold air all about,<br> And therewithal came faint and thin<br> What seemed a far-off battle's din,<br> And on a sight most terrible<br> His eyes in that same minute fell,&#151;<br> The images of slaughtered men,<br> With set eyes and wide wounds, as when<br> Upon the field they first lay slain;<br> And those who there had been their bane<br> With open mouths as if to shout,<br> And frightful eyes of rage and doubt,<br> And hate that never more should die. <A NAME="page_218"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 218</FONT></A><br> Then went the shivering fleers by,<br> With death's fear ever in their eyes;<br> And then the heaped-up fatal prize,<br> The blood-stained coin, the unset gem,<br> The gold robe torn from hem to hem,<br> The headless, shattered golden God,<br> The dead priest's crushed divining-rod;<br> The captives, weak from blow and wound,<br> Toiling along; the maiden, bound<br> And helpless, in her raiment torn;<br> The ancient man's last day forlorn:<br> Onward they pressed, and though no sound<br> Their footfalls made upon the ground,<br> Most real indeed they seemed to be.<br> The spilt blood savoured horribly,<br> Heart-breaking the dumb writhings were,<br> Unuttered curses filled the air;<br> Yea, as the wretched band went past,<br> A dreadful look one woman cast<br> On Laurence, and upon his breast<br> A wounded blood-stained hand she pressed.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the heels of these there came<br> A King, that through the night did flame,<br> For something more than steel or brass<br> The matter of his armour was;<br> Its fashion strange past words to say;<br> Who knows where first it saw the day?<br> On a red horse he rode; his face <A NAME="page_219"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 219</FONT></A><br> Gave no more hope of any grace<br> Than through the blackness of the night<br> The swift-descending lightning might;<br> And yet therein great joy indeed<br> The brightness of his eyes did feed;;&#151;<br> A joy as of the leaping fire<br> Over the house-roof rising higher<br> To greet the noon-sun, when the glaive<br> Forbids all folk to help or save.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet harmless this one passed him by,<br> And through the air deliciously<br> Faint pensive music breathed, and then<br> There came a throng of maids and men&#151;<br> A young and fair and gentle band;<br> Whereof some passed him hand in hand,<br> Some side by side not touching walked,<br> As though of happy things they talked;<br> Noiseless they were like all the rest<br> As past him up the hill they pressed;<br> Yet she who brushed by him most close<br> Cast to his feet a fresh red rose.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then somewhat of a space there was<br> Before the next band &#146;gan to pass,<br> So faint they moved for very woe;<br> And these were men and maids also,<br> And young were most, and most were fair;<br> And hand in hand some few went there,<br> And still were fain with love to see <A NAME="page_220"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 220</FONT></A><br> Each other's bitter misery;<br> But most, just sundered, went along,<br> With faces drawn by hidden wrong,<br> Clenched hands and muttering lips that cursed<br> From brooding hearts their sin that nursed.<br> And she that went the last of all,<br> Black-robed, in passing by let fall<br> At Laurence's feet a black-bound wreath<br> Of bitter herbs long come to death.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone, afoot, when these were gone,<br> A bright one came, whose garments shone<br> In wondrous wise; a bow he bore,<br> And deadly feathered shafts' good store;<br> Winged was he and most Godlike fair;<br> Slowly he went, and oft would stare<br> With eyes distraught down on the grass,<br> As waiting what might come to pass;<br> Then whiles would he look up again,<br> And set his teeth as if with pain;<br> And whiles for very joy of heart<br> His eyes would gleam, his lips would part<br> With such a smile as though the earth<br> Were newly made to give him mirth;<br> Back o&#146;er his shoulder would he gaze<br> Seaward, or through the marshland haze<br> That lay before, strain long and hard,<br> Till fast the tears fell on the sward:&#151;<br> So towards the hill's brow wandered he. <A NAME="page_221"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 221</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then through the moaning of the sea<br> There came a faint and thrilling strain,<br> Till Laurence strove with tears in vain,<br> I And his flesh trembled, part with fear,<br> Part as with some great pleasure near,<br> And then his dazzled eyes could see<br> Once more a noiseless company;<br> And his heart failed him at the sight,<br> And he forgot both wrong and right,<br> And nothing thought of his intent;<br> For close before him now there went<br> Fair women clad in ancient guise<br> That hid but little from his eyes<br> More loveliness than earth doth hold<br> Now, when her bones are growing old;<br> But all too swift they went by him,<br> And fluttering gown and ivory limb<br> Went twinkling up the bare hill-side,<br> And lonely there must he abide.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then seaward had he nigh turned round,<br> And thus the end of life had found,<br> When even before his wildered sight<br> There glided forth a figure white,<br> And passed him by afoot, alone;<br> No raiment on her sweet limbs shone,<br> Only the tresses of her hair<br> The wind drove round her body fair;<br> No sandals were there on her feet, <A NAME="page_222"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 222</FONT></A><br> But still before them blossoms sweet<br> Unnamed, unknown within that land,<br> Sprang up; she held aloft her hand<br> As to the trembling man she turned<br> Her glorious eyes, and on it burned<br> The dreadful pledge, the looked-for thing,<br> The well-wrought, lovely spousal ring.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Laurence trembled more and more;<br> Huge longing his faint heart swept o&#146;er,<br> As one who would a boon beseech.<br> His fevered hand forth did he reach,<br> And then she stayed and gazed at him,<br> Just moving lightly each fair limb<br> As one who loiters, but must go;<br> But even as the twain stood so,<br> She saying nought, he saying nought,<br> And who knows what wild wave of thought<br> Beating betwixt them, from his girth<br> The dread scroll loosened fell to earth,<br> And to his ears where sounds waxed dim<br> Louder its rustle seemed to him<br> Than loudest thunder; down he bent,<br> Remembering now his good intent,<br> And got the scroll within his hand;<br> And when mid prayers he came to stand<br> Upright again, then was she gone,<br> And he once more was left alone. <A NAME="page_223"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 223</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foredone, bewildered, downcast now,<br> Confused clamour heard he grow,<br> And then swept onward through the night<br> A babbling crowd in raiment bright,<br> Wherein none listened aught at all<br> To what from other lips might fall,<br> And none might meet his fellow's gaze;<br> And still o&#146;er every restless face<br> Passed restless shades of rage and pain,<br> And sickening fear and longing vain.<br> On wound that manifold agony<br> Unholpen, vile, till earth and sea<br> Grew silent, till the moonlight died<br> Before a false light blaring wide,<br> And from amidst that fearful folk<br> The Lord of all the pageant broke.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most like a mighty king was he,<br> And crowned and sceptered royally;<br> As a white flame his visage shone,<br> Sharp, clear-cut as a face of stone;<br> But flickering flame, not flesh, it was;<br> And over it such looks did pass<br> Of wild desire, and pain, and fear,<br> As in his people's faces were,<br> But tenfold fiercer: furthermore,<br> A wondrous steed the Master bore,<br> Unnameable of kind or make,<br> Not horse, nor hippogriff, nor drake. <A NAME="page_224"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 224</FONT></A><br> Like and unlike to all of these,<br> And flickering like the semblances<br> Of an ill dream, wrought as in scorn<br> Of sunny noon, fresh eve, and morn,<br> That feed the fair things of the earth.<br> And now brake out a mock of mirth<br> From all that host, and all their eyes<br> Were turned on Laurence in strange wise,<br> Who met the maddening fear that burned<br> Round his unholpen heart, and turned<br> Unto the dreadful king and cried:<br> "What errand go ye on? Abide,<br> Abide! for I have tarried long;<br> Turn thou to me, and right my wrong!<br> One of thy servants keeps from me<br> That which I gave her not; nay, see<br> What thing thy Master bids thee do!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then wearily, as though he knew<br> How all should be, the Master turned,<br> And his red eyes on Laurence burned,<br> As without word the scroll he took;<br> But as he touched the skin he shook<br> As though for fear, and presently<br> In a great voice he &#146;gan to cry:<br> "Shall this endure for ever, Lord?<br> Hast thou no care to keep thy word?<br> And must such double men abide?<br> Not mine, not mine, nor on thy side? <A NAME="page_225"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 225</FONT></A><br> For as thou cursest them I curse:&#151;<br> Make thy souls better, Lord, or worse!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then spake he to the trembling man,<br> "What I am bidden, that I can;<br> Bide here, and thou shalt see thine own<br> Unto thy very feet cast down;<br> Then go and dwell in peace awhile."<br> Then round he turned with sneering smile,<br> And once more lonely was the night,<br> And colourless with grey moonlight.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon indeed the dawn drew near,<br> As Laurence stood &#146;twixt hope and fear,<br> Still doubting, now that all was gone,<br> If his own heart the thing had done,<br> Though on his coat the blood-mark was,<br> Though rose and wreath lay on the grass;<br> So long he waited wearily,<br> Until, when dawn &#146;gan stripe the sky,<br> If he were waking scarce he knew,<br> When, as he deemed, a white cloud drew<br> Anigh him from the marshland grey,<br> Over the empty ghost-trod way,<br> And from its midst a voice there' came:<br> "<i>Thou who hast wrought me added shame,<br> Take back thine own and go thy ways;<br> And think, perchance, in coming days</i>, <A NAME="page_226"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 226</FONT></A><br> <i>When all grows old about thee, how<br> From foolish hands thou needs must throw<br> A gift of unhoped great delight</i>."<br> It vanished as the east grew bright,<br> And in the shadowless still morn<br> A sense of rest to him was born,<br> And looking down unto his feet,<br> His eyes the spousal-ring did meet.<br> He caught it up with a glad cry,<br> And kissed it over longingly,<br> And set it on his hand again;<br> And dreamlike now, and vague and vain,<br> Seemed all those images of fear,<br> The wicked sights that held him there;<br> And rather now his eyes could see<br> Her that was his now verily.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from that drear unhallowed place<br> With merry heart he set his face.<br> A light wind o&#146;er the ocean blew,<br> And fresh and fair the young day grew;<br> The sun rose o&#146;er the green sea's rim,<br> And gave new life and joy to him;<br> The white birds crying o&#146;er his head<br> Seemed praising all his hardihead,<br> And laughing at the worsted foe;<br> So, joyous, onward did he go,<br> And in a little sheltered bay<br> His weariness he washed away, <A NAME="page_227"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 227</FONT></A><br> And made afresh on toward the town:<br> He met the fish-wife coming down<br> From her red cottage to the strand,<br> The fisher-children hand in hand<br> Over some wonder washed ashore;<br> The old man muttering words of lore<br> About the wind that was to be;<br> And soon the white sails specked the sea,<br> And fisher-keel on fisher-keel<br> The furrowed sand again did feel,<br> And round them many a barefoot maid<br> The burden on her shoulders laid,<br> While unto rest the fishers went,<br> And grumbling songs from rough throats sent.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now all is done, and he at last,<br> Weary, but full of joy, has passed<br> Over his threshold once again,<br> And scarce believed is all the pain<br> And all the fear that he has had,<br> Now night and day shall make him glad.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Palumbus, tossed about<br> His soul might be in dread and doubt,<br> In rest at least his body lay<br> Ere the great bell struck noon that day.<br> And soon a carver did his best<br> To make an image of that rest, <A NAME="page_228"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 228</FONT></A><br> Nor aught of gold did Laurence spare<br> To make his tomb both rich and fair;<br> And o&#146;er his clasped hands and his head<br> Thereafter many a mass was said.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_229"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 229</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>SO when the tale was clean done, with a smile<br> The old priest looked around a little while,<br> That grew, as young and old &#146;gan say their say<br> On that strange dream of time long past away;<br> So listening, with his pleased and thoughtful look<br> He &#146;gan turn o&#146;er the worn leaves of his book,<br> Half noting at the first the flowers therein,<br> Drawn on the margin of the yellowing skin<br> Where chapters ended; or fair images<br> Of kings and lords amidst of war and peace<br> At books&#146; beginnings; till within a space<br> His eyes grew fixed upon a certain place,<br> And he seemed reading. Was it then the name<br> Of some old town before his eyes that came,<br> And drew his thoughts there? Did he see it now?<br> The bridge across the river choked with snow;<br> The pillared market-place, not thronged this eve;<br> The muffled goodwives making haste to leave<br> The gusty minster porch, whose windows shone<br> With the firs t-litten candles; while the drone<br> Of the great organ shook the leaded panes,<br> And the wind moaned about the turret vanes?<br> &#151;Nought changed there, and himself so changed mid change,<br> That the next land&#151;Death's land&#151;would seem nought strange <A NAME="page_230"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 230</FONT></A><br> To his awakening eyes!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! good and ill,<br> When will your strife the fated measure fill?<br> When will the tangled veil be drawn away,<br> And show us all that unimagined day?</p>
