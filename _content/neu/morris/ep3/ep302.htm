<p>DEAD lonely night and all streets quiet now,<br> Thin o&#146;er the moon the hindmost cloud swims past<br> Of that great rack that brought us up the snow;<br> On earth strange shadows o&#146;er the snow are cast;<br> Pale stars, bright moon, swift cloud make heaven so vast<br> That earth left silent by the wind of night<br> Seems shrunken &#146;neath the grey unmeasured height.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! through the hush the looked-for midnight clangs!<br> And then, e&#146;en while its last stroke's solemn drone<br> In the cold air by unlit windows hangs,<br> Out break the bells above the year foredone,<br> Change, kindness lost, love left unloved alone;<br> Till their despairing sweetness makes thee deem<br> Thou once wert loved, if but amidst a dream.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O thou who clingest still to life and love,<br> Though nought of good, no God thou mayst discern,<br> Though nought that is, thine utmost woe can move,<br> Though no soul knows wherewith thine heart doth yearn,<br> Yet, since thy weary lips no curse can learn,<br> Cast no least thing thou lovedst once away,<br> Since yet perchance thine eyes shall see the day.</p>

<p>DECEMBER came, with mirth men needs must make<br> E&#146;en for the empty days and leisures&#146; sake<br> That earth's cold leaden sleep doth bring; so there<br> Our elders sat within the guest-hall fair,<br> Not looking older for the snow without;<br> Cheery enough; remembering not old doubt,<br> A gnawing pain once, grown too hard to bear,<br> And so cast by; not thinking of old fear,<br> That conquering once, e&#146;en with its victory<br> Must fade away, and, like all things else, die.<br> Not thinking of much else than that they had<br> Enough of life to make them somewhat glad<br> When all went well with them.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now so it fell<br> That mariners were there, who &#146;gan to tell<br> Mishaps betid upon the winter seas,<br> Which set some younger men amidst of these<br> To ask the Wanderers of their voyage vain,<br> As knowing scarce the tale thereof. Small pain<br> It gave them now to answer: yet belike<br> On the old men, their hosts, the thing did strike<br> In jarring wise, this turning o&#146;er and o&#146;er<br> Of memories once so bitter sharp and sore:<br> Wherefore at last an elder said, "Let be,<br> My masters! if about the troublous sea <A NAME="page_4"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 4</FONT></A><br> Ye needs must hear, hearken a tale once told<br> By kin of ours in the dim days of old,<br> Whose thoughts when turning to a peaceful home<br> Unto this very west of ours must come&#151;<br> &#151;Scarce causelessly meseems when all is said,<br> And I remember that years bow my head,<br> And not the trouble of those days of war,<br> Of loss and wrong that in old stories are."</p>
