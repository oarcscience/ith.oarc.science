<p>FROM this dull rainy undersky and low,<br> This murky ending of a leaden day,<br> That never knew the sun, this half-thawed snow,<br> These tossing black boughs faint against the grey<br> Of gathering night, thou turnest, dear, away<br> Silent, but with thy scarce-seen kindly smile<br> Sent through the dusk my longing to beguile.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, the lights gleam, and all is dark without!<br> And in the sudden change our eyes meet dazed&#151;<br> O look, love, look again! the veil of doubt<br> Just for one flash, past counting, then was raised!<br> O eyes of heaven, as clear thy sweet soul blazed<br> On mine a moment! O come back again<br> Strange rest and dear amid the long dull pain!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, nay, gone by! though there she sitteth still,<br> With wide grey eyes so frank and fathomless&#151;<br> Be patient, heart, thy days they yet shall fill<br> With utter rest&#151;Yea, now thy pain they bless,<br> And feed thy last hope of the world's redress&#151;<br> O unseen hurrying rack! O wailing wind!<br> What rest and where go ye this night to find? <A NAME="page_88"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 88</FONT></A></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>THE year has changed its name since that last tale;<br> Yet nought the prisoned spring doth that avail.<br> Deep buried under snow the country lies;<br> Made dim by whirling flakes the rook still flies<br> South-west before the wind; noon is as still<br> As midnight on the southward-looking hill,<br> Whose slopes have heard so many words and loud<br> Since on the vine the woolly buds first showed.<br> The raven hanging o&#146;er the farmstead gate,<br> While for another death his eye doth wait,<br> Hears but the muffled sound of crowded byre<br> And winds&#146; moan round the wall. Up in the spire<br> The watcher set high o&#146;er the half-hid town<br> Hearkens the sound of chiming bells fall down<br> Below him; and so dull and dead they seem<br> That he might well-nigh be amidst a dream<br> Wherein folk hear and hear not.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a tide,<br> With all work gone from the hushed world outside,<br> Still finds our old folk living, and they sit<br> Watching the snow-flakes by the window flit<br> Midmost the time &#146;twixt noon and dusk; till now<br> One of the elders clears his knitted brow,<br> And says:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, hearken of a man who first<br> In every place seemed doomed to be accursed; <A NAME="page_89"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 89</FONT></A><br> To tell about his ill hap lies on me;<br> Before the winter is quite o&#146;er, maybe<br> Some other mouth of his good hap may tell;<br> But no third tale there is, of what befell<br> His fated life, when he had won his place;<br> And that perchance is not so ill a case<br> For him and us; for we may rise up, glad<br> At all the rest and triumph that he had<br> Before he died; while he, forgetting clean<br> The sorrow and the joy his eyes had seen,<br> Lies quiet and well famed&#151;and serves to-day<br> To wear a space of winter-tide away."</p>
