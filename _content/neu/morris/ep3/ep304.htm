<p><FONT SIZE="-1">ASLAUG, the daughter of Sigurd who slew the Dragon, and of Brynhild whom he loved, lost all her friends and kin, and was nourished amid great misery; yet in the end her fortune, her glory, and her beauty prevailed, and she came to mighty estate.</FONT></p>  
<p>A FAIR tale might I tell to you<br> Of Sigurd, who the dragon slew<br> Upon the murder-wasted heath,<br> And how love led him unto death,<br> Through strange wild ways of joy and pain;<br> Then such a story should ye gain,<br> If I could tell it all aright,<br> As well might win you some delight<br> From out the woefullest of days;<br> But now have I no heart to raise<br> That mighty sorrow laid asleep,<br> That love so sweet, so strong and deep,<br> That as ye hear the wonder told<br> In those few strenuous words of old,<br> The whole world seems to rend apart<br> When heart is torn away from heart.<br> But the world lives still, and to-day<br> The green Rhine wendeth on its way <A NAME="page_31"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 31</FONT></A><br> Over the unseen golden curse<br> That drew its lords to worse and worse,<br> Till that last dawn in Atli's hall,<br> When the red flame flared over all,<br> Lighting the leaden, sunless sea.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet so much told of this must be,<br> That Sigurd, while his youth was bright<br> And unstained, &#146;midst the first delight<br> Of Brynhild's love&#151;that him did gain<br> All joy, all woe, and very bane&#151;<br> Begat on her a woman-child.<br> In hope she bore the maid, and smiled<br> When of its father's face she thought;<br> But when sad time the change had brought,<br> And she to Gunnar's house must go,<br> She, thinking how she might bestow<br> The memory of that lovely eve,<br> That morn o&#146;er-sweet, the child did leave<br> With Heimir, her old foster-sire,<br> A mighty lord; then, with the fire<br> Of her old love still smouldering,<br> And brooding over many a thing,<br> She went unto her life and death.<br> Nought, as I said, the story saith<br> Of all the wrong and love that led<br> Her feet astray: together dead<br> They lie now on their funeral pile,<br> And now the little one doth smile <A NAME="page_32"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 32</FONT></A><br> Upon the glittering war-array<br> Of the men come the sooth to say<br> To Heimir of that bitter end.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent he stared till these did wend<br> Into the hall to fire and board,<br> Then by the porch without a word<br> Long time he sat: then he arose<br> And drew his sword, and hard and close<br> Gazed on the thin-worn edge, and said:<br> "Smooth cheeks, sweet hands, and art thou dead?<br> O me thy glory! Woe is me!<br> I thought once more thine eyes to see&#151;<br> Had I been young three years agone,<br> When thou a maiden burd-alone,<br> Hadst eighteen summers!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he spake,<br> He gat him swiftly to the brake<br> Of thorn-trees nigh his house: and some,<br> When calm once more he sat at home,<br> Deemed he had wept: but no word more<br> He spake thereof.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days wore,<br> And now alone he oft would be<br> Within his smithy; heedfully<br> He guarded it, that none came in;<br> Nor marvelled men; "For he doth win<br> Some work of craftsmanship," said they,<br> "And such before on many a day <A NAME="page_33"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 33</FONT></A><br> Hath been his wont."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it went on<br> That a long while he wrought alone;<br> But on the tenth day bore in there<br> Aslaug, the little maiden fair,<br> Three winters old; and then the thing<br> A little set folk marvelling;<br> Yet none the less in nought durst they<br> To watch him. So to end of day<br> Time drew, and still unto the hall<br> He came not, and a dread &#146;gan fall<br> Upon his household, lest some ill<br> The quiet of their lives should kill;<br> And so it fell that the next morn<br> They found them of their lord forlorn,<br> And Aslaug might they see no more;<br> Wide open was the smithy door,<br> The forge a-cold, and hammering tools<br> Lay on the floor, with woodwright's rules,<br> And chips and shavings of hard wood.<br> Moreover, when they deemed it good<br> To seek for him, nought might they do,<br> The tale says, for so dark it grew<br> Over all ways, that no man might<br> Know the green meads from water white.<br> So back they wended sorrowfully,<br> And still most like it seemed to be,<br> That Odin had called Heimir home;<br> And nothing strange it seemed to some <A NAME="page_34"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 34</FONT></A><br> That with him the sweet youngling was,<br> Since Brynhild's love might bring to pass<br> E&#146;en mightier things than this, they said,<br> And sure the little gold-curled head,<br> The pledge of all her earthly weal,<br> In Freyia's house she longed to feel.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further the way was than they deemed<br> Unto that rest whereof they dreamed<br> Both to the greybeard and the child;<br> For now by trodden way and wild<br> Goes Heimir long: wide-faced is he,<br> Thin-cheeked, hooked-nosed, e&#146;en as might be<br> An ancient erne; his hair falls down<br> From &#146;neath a wide slouched hat of brown,<br> And mingles white with his white beard;<br> A broad brown brand, most men have feared,<br> Hangs by his side, and at his back<br> Is slung a huge harp, that doth lack<br> All fairness certes, and so great<br> It is, that few might bear its weight;<br> Yea, Heimir even, somewhat slow<br> Beneath its burden walketh now,<br> And looketh round, and stayeth soon.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a calm sunny afternoon,<br> Within a cleared space of a wood,<br> At last the huge old warrior stood<br> And peered about him doubtfully;<br> Who, when nought living he might see, <A NAME="page_35"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 35</FONT></A><br> But mid the beech-boughs high aloft<br> A blue-winged jay, and squirrel soft,<br> And in the grass a watchful hare,<br> Unslung his harp and knelt down there<br> Beside it, and a little while<br> Handled the hollow with a smile<br> Of cunning, and behold, the thing<br> Opened, as by some secret spring,<br> And there within the hollow lay,<br> Clad in gold-fringed well-wrought array,<br> Aslaug, the golden-headed child,<br> Asleep and rosy; but she smiled<br> As Heimir's brown hand drew a-near,<br> And woke up free from any fear,<br> And stretched her hands out towards his face.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat him down in the green place,<br> With kind arms round the little one,<br> Till, fully waked now, to the sun<br> She turned, and babbling, &#146;gainst his breast<br> Her dimpled struggling hands she pressed:<br> His old lips touched those eyes of hers,<br> That Sigurd's hope and Brynhild's tears<br> Made sad e&#146;en in her life's first spring;<br> Then sweet her chuckling laugh did ring,<br> As down amid the flowery grass<br> He set her, and beheld her pass<br> From flower to flower in utter glee;<br> Therewith he reached out thoughtfully,<br> And cast his arms around the harp, <A NAME="page_36"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 36</FONT></A><br> That at the first most strange and sharp<br> Rang through the still day, and the child<br> Stopped, startled by that music wild:<br> But then a change carne o&#146;er the strings,<br> As, tinkling sweet, of merry things<br> They seemed to tell, and to and fro<br> Danced Aslaug, till the tune did grow<br> Fuller and stronger, sweeter still,<br> And all the woodland place did fill<br> With sound, not merry now nor sad,<br> But sweet, heart-raising, as it had<br> The gathered voice of that fair day<br> Amidst its measured strains; her play<br> Amid the flowers grew slower now,<br> And sadder did the music grow,<br> And yet still sweeter: and with that,<br> Nigher to where the old man sat<br> Aslaug &#146;gan move, until at last<br> All sound from the strained strings there passed<br> As into each other's eyes they gazed;<br> Then, sighing, the young thing he raised,<br> And set her softly on his knee,<br> And laid her round cheek pitifully<br> Unto his own, and said:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Indeed,<br> Of such as I shalt thou have need,<br> As swift the troubled days wear by,<br> And yet I know full certainly<br> My life on earth shall not be long: <A NAME="page_37"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 37</FONT></A><br> And those who think to better wrong<br> By working wrong shall seek thee wide<br> To slay thee; yea, belike they ride<br> E&#146;en now unto my once-loved home.<br> Well, to a void place shall they come,<br> And I for thee thus much have wrought&#151;<br> For thee and Brynhild&#151;yea, and nought<br> I deem it still to turn my face<br> Each morn unto some unknown place<br> Like a poor churl&#151;for, ah! who knows<br> Upon what wandering wind that blows<br> Drives Brynhild's spirit through the air;<br> And now by such road may I fare<br> That we may meet ere many days."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the youngling did he raise<br> Unto his face, for to the earth<br> Had she slipped down; her babbling mirth<br> Had mingled with his low deep speech;<br> But now, as she her hand did reach<br> Unto his beard, nor stinted more<br> Her babble, did a change come o&#146;er<br> His face; for through the windless day<br> Afar a mighty horn did bray;<br> Then from beneath his cloak he drew<br> A golden phial, and set it to<br> Her ruddy lips in haste, and she<br> Gazed at him awhile fearfully,<br> As though she knew he was afraid; <A NAME="page_38"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 38</FONT></A><br> But silently the child he laid<br> In the harp's hollow place, for now<br> Drowsy and drooping did she grow<br> &#146;Neath the strong potion; hastily<br> He shut the harp, and raised it high<br> Upon his shoulder, set his sword<br> Ready to hand, and with no word<br> Stalked off along the forest glade;<br> But muttered presently:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Afraid<br> Is a strange word for me to say;<br> But all is changed in a short day,<br> And full of death the world seems grown.<br> Mayhap I shall be left alone<br> When all are dead beside, to dream<br> Of happy life that once did seem<br> So stirring &#146;midst the folk I loved.<br> Ah! is there nought that may be moved<br> By strong desire? yea, nought that rules<br> The very Gods who thrust earth's fools,<br> This way and that as foolishly,<br> For aught I know thereof, as I<br> Deal with the chess when I am drunk?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His head upon his breast was sunk<br> For a long space, and then again<br> He spake: "My life is on the wane;<br> Somewhat of this I yet may learn<br> Ere long; yet I am fain to earn <A NAME="page_39"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 39</FONT></A><br> My rest by reaching Atli's land;<br> For surely &#146;neath his mighty hand<br> Safe from the Niblungs shall she be,<br> Safe from the forge of misery,<br> Grimhild the Wise-wife."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a goad<br> That name was to him; on he strode<br> Still swifter, silent. But day wore<br> As fast between the tree-stems hoar<br> He went his ways; belike it was<br> That he scarce knew if he did pass<br> O&#146;er rough or smooth, by dark or light,<br> Until at last the very night<br> Had closed round him as thinner grew<br> The wood that he was hurrying through;<br> And as he gained a grey hill's brow<br> He felt the sea-breeze meet him now,<br> And heard the low surf's measured beat<br> Upon the beach. He stayed his feet,<br> And through the dusky gathering dark<br> Peered round and saw what seemed a spark<br> Along the hill's ridge; thitherward<br> He turned, still warily on guard,<br> Until he came unto the door<br> Of some stead, lone belike and poor:<br> There knocking, was he bidden in,<br> And heedfully he raised the pin,<br> And entering stood with blinking gaze<br> Before a fire's unsteady blaze. <A NAME="page_40"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 40</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There sat a woman all alone<br> Whom some ten years would make a crone,<br> Yet would they little worsen her;<br> Her face was sorely pinched with care,<br> Sour and thin-lipped she was; of hue<br> E&#146;en like a duck's foot; whitish blue<br> Her eyes were, seeming as they kept<br> Wide open even when she slept.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rose up, and was no less great<br> Than a tall man, a thing of weight<br> Was the gaunt hand that held a torch<br> As Heimir, midmost of the porch,<br> Fixed his deep grey and solemn eyes<br> Upon that wretched wife's surprise.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," said she, "what may be your will?<br> Little we have your sack to fill,<br> If on thieves&#146; errand ye are come;<br> But since the goodman is from home<br> I know of none shall say you nay<br> If ye have will to bear away<br> The goodwife."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As on a burned house<br> Grown cold, the moon shines dolorous<br> From out the rainy lift, so now<br> A laugh must crease her lip and brow.<br> "I am no thief, goodwife," he said,<br> "But ask wherein to lay my head<br> To-night." <A NAME="page_41"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 41</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, goodman, sit," said she:<br> "Thine ugly box of minstrelsy<br> With thine attire befits not ill;<br> And both belike may match thy skill."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So by the fire he sat him down,<br> And she too sat, and coarse and brown<br> The thread was that her rock gave forth<br> As there she spun; of little worth<br> Was all the gear that hall did hold.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Heimir new-come from the cold<br> Had set his harp down by his side,<br> And, turning his grey eyes and wide<br> Away from hers, slouched down his hat<br> Yet farther o&#146;er his brows, and sat<br> With hands outstretched unto the flame.<br> But had he noted how there came<br> A twinkle into her dead eyes,<br> He had been minded to arise,<br> Methinks; for better company<br> The wild-wood wolf had been than she.<br> Because, from out the hodden grey<br> That was the great man's poor array,<br> Once and again could she behold<br> How that the gleam of ruddy gold<br> Came forth: so therewith she arose,<br> And, wandering round the hall, drew close<br> Unto the great harp, and could see<br> Some fringe of golden bravery <A NAME="page_42"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 42</FONT></A><br> Hanging therefrom.&#151;And the man too,<br> In spite of patch and clouted shoe,<br> And unadorned sword, seemed indeed<br> Scarce less than a great king in need,<br> So wholly noble was his mien.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, with these things thus thought and seen,<br> Within her mind grew fell intent<br> As to and fro the hall she went,<br> And from the ark at last did take<br> Meal forth for porridge and for cake,<br> And to the fire she turned, and &#146;gan<br> To look still closer on the man<br> As with the girdle and the pot<br> She busied her, and doubted not<br> That on his arm a gold ring was;<br> For presently, as she did pass,<br> Somewhat she brushed the cloak from him,<br> And saw the gold gleam nowise dim.<br> Then sure, if man might shape his fate,<br> Her greed impatient and dull hate<br> Within her eyes he might have seen,<br> And so this tale have never been.<br> But nought he heeded; far away<br> His thoughts were.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith did she lay<br> The meal upon the board, and said,<br> "Meseems ye would be well apaid<br> Of meat and drink, and it is here,<br> Fair lord&#151;though somewhat sorry cheer; <A NAME="page_43"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 43</FONT></A><br> Fall to now."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whining, with a grin<br> She watched, as one who sets a gin,<br> If at the name of lord at all<br> He started, but no speech did fall<br> From his old lips, and wearily<br> He gat to meat, and she stood by,<br> And poured the drink to him, and said:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To such a husband am I wed<br> That ill is speech with him, when he<br> Comes home foredone with drudgery;<br> And though indeed I deem thee one<br> Who deeds of fame full oft hath done<br> And would not fear him, yet most ill<br> &#146;Twould be the bliss of us to spill<br> In brawl with him, as might betide<br> If thou his coming shouldst abide.<br> Our barley barn is close hereby,<br> Wherein a weary man might lie<br> And be no worse at dawn of day."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, goodwife," said he, "lead the way!<br> Worse lodging have I had than that,<br> Where the wolf howled unto the bat,<br> And red the woodland stream did run."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She started back, he seemed as one<br> Who might have come back from the dead,<br> To wreak upon her evil head <A NAME="page_44"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 44</FONT></A><br> Her sour ill life, but nought the more<br> He heeded her; "Go on before,"<br> He said, "for I am in no case<br> To-night to meet an angry face<br> And hold my hand from my good sword."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So out she passed without a word,<br> Though when he took in careful wise<br> The heavy harp, with greedy eyes<br> And an ill scowl she gazed thereon,<br> Yet durst say nought. But soon they won<br> Unto the barn's door&#151;he turned round,<br> And, gazing down the rugged ground,<br> Beheld the sea wide reaching, white<br> Beneath the new-risen moon, and bright<br> His face waxed for a little while,<br> And on the still night did he smile,<br> As into the dark place he went,&#151;<br> And saw no more of the grey bent,<br> Or sea, or sky, or morrow's sun.<br> Unless perchance when all is done,<br> And all the wrongs the Gods have wrought<br> Come utterly with them to nought,<br> New heavens and earth he shall behold,<br> And peaceful folk, and days of gold,<br> When Baldur is come back again<br> O&#146;er an undying world to reign.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For when the carl came home that night,<br> In every ill wise that she might, <A NAME="page_45"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 45</FONT></A><br> She egged him on their guest to slay<br> As sleeping in the barn he lay;<br> And, since the man was no ill mate<br> For her, and heedless evil fate<br> Had made him big and strong enow,<br> He plucked up heart to strike the blow,<br> Though but a coward thief he was.<br> So at the grey dawn did he pass<br> Unto the barn, and entered there;<br> But through its dusk therewith did hear<br> The sound of harp-strings tinkling: then,<br> As is the wont of such-like men,<br> Great fear of ghosts fell on his heart;<br> Yet, trembling sore, he thrust apart<br> The long stems of the barley-straw,<br> And, peering round about, he saw<br> Heimir asleep, his naked brand<br> Laid o&#146;er his knees, but his right hand<br> Amid the harp-strings, whence there came<br> A mournful tinkling; and some name<br> His lips seemed muttering, and withal<br> A strange sound on his ears did fall<br> As of a young child murmuring low<br> The muffled sounds of passing woe.<br> Nought dreadful saw he; yet the hair<br> &#146;Gan bristle on his head with fear,<br> And twice was he at point to turn<br> His bread by other craft to earn;<br> But in the end prevailed in him <A NAME="page_46"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 46</FONT></A><br> His raging greed &#146;gainst glimmerings dim<br> Of awe and pity; which but wrought<br> In such wise in him that he thought<br> How good it were if all were done,<br> And day, and noise, and the bright sun<br> Were come again: he crept along,<br> Poising a spear, thick shafted, strong,<br> In his right hand; and ever fast<br> His heart beat as the floor he passed,<br> And o&#146;er his shoulder gazed for fear<br> Once and again; he raised the spear,<br> As Heimir's hand the string still pressed,<br> And thrust it through his noble breast,<br> Then turned and fled, and heard behind<br> A sound as of a wildered wind,<br> Half moan, half sigh; then all was still.<br> But yet such fear his soul did fill<br> That he stayed not until he came<br> Into the hall, and cried the name<br> Of his wife, Grima, in high voice.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah well," she said, "what needs this noise,<br> Can ye not see me here?&#151;Well then?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wife," said he, "of the sons of men<br> I deem him not, rather belike<br> Odin it was that I did strike."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She laughed an ill laugh. "Well," she said,<br> "What then, if only he be dead?" <A NAME="page_47"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 47</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What if he only seemed to die?"<br> He said, "and when night draweth nigh<br> Shall come again grown twice as great,<br> And eat where yesternight he ate?<br> For certes, wife, that harp of his,<br> No earthly minstrelsy it is,<br> Since as in sleep the man was laid<br> Of its own self a tune it played;<br> Yea, yea, and in a man's voice cried;<br> Belike a troll therein doth bide."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An ugly, ill-made minstrel's tool,"<br> She said; "thou blundering, faint-heart fool!<br> Some wind moaned through the barn belike,<br> And the man's hand the strings did strike."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet she shivered as she spake,<br> As though some fear her heart did take,<br> And neither durst to draw anigh<br> The barn until the sun was high,<br> Then in they went together, and saw<br> The old man lying in the straw,<br> Scarce otherwise than if asleep,<br> Though in his heart the spear lay deep,<br> And round about the floor was red.<br> Then Grima went, and from the dead<br> Stripped off the gold ring, while the man<br> Stood still apart; then she began<br> To touch the harp, but in no wise <A NAME="page_48"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 48</FONT></A><br> Might open it to reach the prize.<br> Wherefore she bade her husband bring<br> Edge-tools to split the cursed thing.<br> He brought them trembling, and the twain<br> Fell to, and soon their end did gain;<br> But shrank back trembling to see there<br> The youngling, her grey eyes and clear<br> Wide open, fearless; but the wife<br> Knew too much of her own sour life<br> To fear the other world o&#146;ermuch,<br> And soon began to pull and touch<br> The golden raiment of the may;<br> And at the last took heart to say:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be comforted! we shall not die;<br> For no work is this certainly<br> Wrought in the country never seen.<br> But raiment of a Hunnish queen&#151;<br> Gold seest thou, goodman! gems seest thou!&#151;<br> No ill work hast thou wrought I trow.<br> But, for the maiden, we must give<br> Victuals to her that she may live;<br> For though to-day she is indeed<br> But one more mouth for us to feed,<br> Yet as she waxeth shall she do<br> Right many a thing to help us two;<br> Yea, whatso hardest work there is,<br> That shall be hers&#151;no life of bliss<br> Like sewing gold mid bower-mays; <A NAME="page_49"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 49</FONT></A><br> She shall be strong, too, as the days<br> Increase on her."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said the man:<br> "Get speech from her, for sure she can<br> Tell somewhat of her life and state."<br> But whatso he or his vile mate<br> Might do, no word at all she spake<br> Either for threat or promise sake;<br> Until at last they deemed that she<br> Was tongue-tied: so now presently<br> Unto the homestead was she brought,<br> And her array all golden-wrought<br> Stripped from her, and in rags of grey<br> Clad was she. But from light of day<br> The carl hid Heimir dead, and all<br> Into dull sodden life did fall.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>SO with the twain abode the may,<br> Waxing in beauty day by day,<br> But ever as one tongue-tied was,<br> What thing soever came to pass;<br> And needs the hag must call her Crow:<br> "A name," she said, "full good enow<br> For thee&#151;my mother bore it erst."<br> So lived the child that she was nursed <A NAME="page_50"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 50</FONT></A><br> On little meat and plenteous blows;<br> Yet nowise would she weep, but close<br> Would set her teeth thereat, and go<br> About what work she had to do,<br> And ever wrought most sturdily;<br> Until at last she grew to be<br> More than a child. And now the place<br> That once had borne so dull a face<br> Grew well-nigh bright to look upon,<br> And whatso thing might shine there shone;<br> Yea, all but her who brought about<br> That change therein&#151;for, past all doubt,<br> Years bettered in nowise our hag,<br> And ever she said that any rag<br> Was good enough to clothe the Crow.<br> And still her hate did grow and grow<br> As Aslaug grew to womanhood;<br> Oft would she sit in murderous mood<br> Long hours, with hand anigh a knife,<br> As Aslaug slept, all hate at strife<br> With greed within her; yet withal<br> Something like fear of her did fall<br> Upon her heart, and heavy weighed<br> That awful beauty, that oft stayed<br> Her hand from closing on the hilt,<br> E&#146;en more than thought of good things spilt.<br> Hard words and blows this scarce might stay,<br> For like the minutes of the day,<br> Not looked for, noted not when gone, <A NAME="page_51"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 51</FONT></A><br> Were all such things unto the crone,<br> And, smitten or unsmitten, still<br> The Crow was swift to work her will.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spring-tide of her seventeenth year,<br> On the hill-side the house anear<br> Went Aslaug, following up her goats:<br> On such a day as when Love floats<br> Through the soft air unseen, to touch<br> Our hearts with longings overmuch<br> Unshapen into hopes, to make<br> All things seem fairer for the sake<br> Of that which cometh, who doth bear<br> Who knows how much of grief and fear<br> In his fair arms. So Aslaug went,<br> On vague and unnamed thoughts intent,<br> That seemed to her full sweet enow,<br> And ever greater hope did grow,<br> And sweet seemed life to her and good,<br> Small reason why: into the wood<br> She turned, and wandered slim and fair<br> &#146;Twixt the dark tree-boles: strange and rare<br> The sight was of her golden head,<br> So good, uncoifed, unchapleted,<br> Above her sordid dark array,<br> That over her fair body lay<br> As dark clouds on a lilied hill.<br> The wild things well might gaze their fill,<br> As through the wind-flowers brushed her feet, <A NAME="page_52"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 52</FONT></A><br> As her lips smiled when those did meet<br> The lush-cold blue-bells, or were set<br> Light on the pale dog-violet<br> Late April bears: the red-throat jay<br> Screamed not for nought, as on her way<br> She went, light-laughing at some thought;<br> If the dove moaned &#146;twas not for nought,<br> Since she was gone too soon from him,<br> And e&#146;en the sight he had was dim<br> For the thick budding twigs. At last<br> Into an open space she passed,<br> Nigh filled with a wide, shallow lake,<br> Amidmost which the fowl did take<br> Their pastime; o&#146;er the firmer grass,<br> &#146;Twixt rushy ooze, swift did she pass,<br> Until upon a bank of sand<br> Close to the water did she stand,<br> And gazed down in that windless place<br> Upon the image of her face,<br> And as she gazed laughed musically<br> Once and again; nor heeded she<br> Her straying flock: her voice, that none<br> Had heard since Heimir was undone<br> Within that wretched stead, began<br> Such speech as well had made a man<br> Forget his land and kin to make<br> Those sweet lips tremble for his sake:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spring bringeth love," she said, "to all." <A NAME="page_53"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 53</FONT></A><br> She sighed as those sweet sounds did fall<br> From her unkissed lips: "Ah," said she,<br> "How came that sweet word unto me,<br> Among such wretched folk who dwell,<br> Folk who still seem to carry hell<br> About with them?&#151;That ancient man<br> They slew, with whom my life began,<br> I deem he must have taught me that,<br> And how the steel-clad maiden sat<br> Asleep within the ring of flame,<br> Asleep, and waiting till Love came,<br> Who was my father: many a dream<br> I dream thereof, till it doth seem<br> That they will fetch me hence one day.<br> Somewhere I deem life must be gay,<br> The flowers are wrought not for the sake<br> Of those two murderers."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While she spake<br> Her hands were busy with her gown,<br> And at the end it slipped adown<br> And left her naked there and white<br> In the unshadowed noontide light.<br> Like Freyia in her house of gold,<br> A while her limbs did she behold<br> Clear mirrored in the lake beneath;<br> Then slowly, with a shuddering breath,<br> Stepped in the water cold, and played<br> Amid the ripple that she made,<br> And spoke again aloud, as though <A NAME="page_54"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 54</FONT></A><br> The lone place of her heart might know:<br> "Soothly," she said, "if I knew fear,<br> Scarcely should I be sporting here,<br> But blinder surely has the crone<br> In those last months of winter grown,<br> Nor knows if I be foul or sweet,<br> Or sharp stripes might I chance to meet,<br> As heretofore it hath been seen<br> When I have dared to make me clean<br> Amid their foulness: loathes her heart<br> That one she hates should have a part<br> In the world's joy.&#151;Well, time wears by,<br> I was not made for misery.<br> Surely if dimly do mine eyes<br> Behold no sordid tale arise,<br> No ill life drawing near&#151;who knows<br> But I am kept for greater woes,<br> Godlike despair that makes not base,<br> Though like a stone may grow the face<br> Because of it, yea, and the heart<br> A hard-wrought treasure set apart<br> For the world's glory?"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith she<br> Made for the smooth bank leisurely,<br> And, naked as she was, did pass<br> Unto the warm and flowery grass<br> All unashamed, and fearing not<br> For aught that should draw nigh the spot:<br> And soothly had some hunter been <A NAME="page_55"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 55</FONT></A><br> Near by and all her beauty seen,<br> He would have deemed he saw a fay<br> And hastened trembling on his way.<br> But when full joyance she had had<br> Of sun and flowers, her limbs she clad<br> In no long time, forsooth, and then<br> Called back her wandering flock again<br> With one strange dumb cry, e&#146;en as though<br> Their hearts and minds she needs must know,<br> For hurrying back with many a bleat<br> They huddled round about her feet.<br> And back she went unto the stead,<br> Strange visions pressing round her head,<br> So light of heart and limb, that though<br> She went with measured steps and slow,<br> Each yard seemed but a dance to her.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now the thick wood did she clear,<br> And o&#146;er the bent beheld the sea,<br> And stood amazed there suddenly,<br> For a long ship, with shield-hung rail,<br> And fair-stained flapping raven-sail,<br> And golden dragon-stem, there lay<br> On balanced oars amidst the bay,<br> Slow heaving with the unrippled swell.<br> With a strange hope she might not tell<br> Her eyes ran down the strand, and there<br> Lay beached a ship's boat painted fair,<br> And on the shingle by her side <A NAME="page_56"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 56</FONT></A><br> Three blue-clad axemen did abide<br> Their fellows, sent belike ashore<br> To gather victuals for their store.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked not long; with heart that beat<br> More quickly and with hurrying feet<br> Unto the homestead did she pass,<br> And when anigh the door she was<br> She heard men's voices deep and rough;<br> Then the shrill crone, who said, "Enough<br> Of work I once had done for you,<br> But now my days left are but few<br> And I am weak; I prithee wait,<br> Already now the noon is late,<br> My daughter, Crow, shall soon be here."<br> "Nay," said a shipman, "have no fear,<br> Goodwife, a speedy death to get,<br> Thou art a sturdy carline yet:<br> Howbeit we well may wait a while."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereat Aslaug, with a strange smile,<br> Fresh from that water in the wood,<br> Pushed back the crazy door, and stood<br> Upon the threshold silently;<br> Bareheaded and barefoot was she,<br> And scarce her rags held each to each,<br> Yet did the shipmen stay their speech<br> And open-mouthed upon her stare,<br> As with bright eyes and face flushed fair <A NAME="page_57"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 57</FONT></A><br> She stood; one gleaming lock of gold,<br> Strayed from her fair head's plaited fold,<br> Fell far below her girdlestead,<br> And round about her shapely head<br> A garland of dog-violet<br> And wind-flowers meetly had she set:<br> They deemed it little scathe indeed<br> That her coarse homespun ragged weed<br> Fell off from her round arms and lithe<br> Laid on the door-post, that a withe<br> Of willows was her only belt;<br> And each as he gazed at her felt<br> As some gift had been given him.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last one grumbled, "Nowise dim<br> It is to see, goodwife, that this<br> No branch of thy great kinship is."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grima was glaring on the may,<br> And scarce for rage found words to say;<br> "Yea, soothly is she of our kin:<br> Sixty-five winters changeth skin.<br> And whatsoever she may be,<br> Though she is dumb as a dead tree,<br> She worketh ever double-tide.<br> So, masters, ope your mealsacks wide<br> And fall to work; enow of wood<br> There is, I trow." <A NAME="page_58"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 58</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there she stood,<br> Shaking all o&#146;er, and when the may<br> Brushed past her going on her way,<br> From off the board a knife she caught,<br> And well-nigh had it in her thought<br> To end it all. Small heed the men<br> Would take of her, forsooth; and when<br> They turned their baking-work to speed,<br> And Aslaug fell the meal to knead,<br> He was the happiest of them all<br> Unto whose portion it did fall<br> To take the loaves from out her hand;<br> And gaping often would he stand,<br> And ever he deemed that he could feel<br> A trembling all along the peel<br> Whenas she touched it&#151;sooth to say,<br> Such bread as there was baked that day<br> Was never seen: such as it was<br> The work was done, and they did pass<br> Down toward the ship, and as they went<br> A dull place seemed the thymy bent,<br> Gilded by sunset; the fair ship,<br> That soft in the long swell did dip<br> Her golden dragon, seemed nought worth,<br> And they themselves, all void of mirth,<br> Stammering and blundering in their speech,<br> Still looking back, seemed each to each<br> Ill-shapen, ugly, rough and base<br> As might be found in any place. <A NAME="page_59"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 59</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, saith the tale, and when the bread<br> Was broken, just as light as lead<br> Men found the same, as sweet as gall,<br> Half baked and sodden; one and all<br> Men gave it to the devil; at last<br> Unto their lord the story passed,<br> Who called for them, and bade them say<br> Why they had wrought in such a way;<br> They grinned and stammered, till said one:<br> "We did just e&#146;en as must be done<br> When men are caught; had it been thou<br> A-cold had been the oven now."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ye deal in riddles," said the lord,<br> "Enough brine is there overboard<br> To fill you full if even so<br> Ye needs must have it."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We did go,"<br> The man said, "to a house, and found<br> That lack of all things did abound;<br> A yellow-faced and blear-eyed crone<br> Was in the sooty hall alone;<br> But as we talked with her, and she<br> Spake to us ill and craftily,<br> A wondrous scent was wafted o&#146;er<br> The space about the open door,<br> And all the birds drew near to sing,<br> And summer pushed on into spring,<br> Until there stood before our eyes <A NAME="page_60"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 60</FONT></A><br> A damsel clad in wretched guise,<br> Yet surely of the gods I deem,<br> So fair she was;&#151;well then this dream<br> Of Freyia on midsummer night,<br> This breathing love, this once-seen sight,<br> Flitted amidst us kneading meal,<br> And from us all the wits did steal;&#151;<br> Hadst thou been wise?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," said the lord,<br> "This seemeth but an idle word;<br> Yet since ye all are in one tale<br> Somewhat to you it may avail&#151;<br> Speak out! my lady that is dead&#151;<br> Thora, the chief of goodlihead&#151;<br> Came this one nigh to her at all?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One answer from their mouths did fall,<br> That she was fairest ever seen.<br> "If two such marvellous things have been<br> Wrought by the gods, then have they wrought<br> Exceeding well," the lord said; "nought<br> Will serve me now but to have sight<br> Of her, and hear the fresh delight<br> Of her sweet voice."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, nay," one cried,<br> "The carline called the maid tongue-tied<br> E&#146;en from her birth."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thoughtfully <A NAME="page_61"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 61</FONT></A><br> The lord spake: "Then belike shall be<br> Some wonder in the thing. Lo now,<br> Since I, by reason of my vow<br> Made on the cup at Yule, no more<br> May set foot upon any shore<br> Till I in Micklegarth have been,<br> And somewhat there of arms have seen,<br> Go ye at earliest morn and say<br> That I would see her ere the day<br> Is quite gone by; here shall she come<br> And go as if her father's home<br> The good ship were, and I indeed<br> Her very brother. Odin speed<br> The matter in some better wise,<br> Unless your words be nought but lies!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the next morn she had the word<br> To come unto their king and lord;<br> She answered not, but made as though<br> Their meaning she did fully know,<br> And gave assent: the crone was there,<br> And still askance at her did glare,<br> And mid her hatred grew afeard<br> Of what might come, but spoke no word;<br> And ye may well believe indeed<br> That those men gave her little heed,<br> But stared at Aslaug as she stood<br> Beside the greasy, blackened wood<br> Of the hall's uprights, fairer grown <A NAME="page_62"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 62</FONT></A><br> Than yesterday, soft &#146;neath her gown<br> Her fair breast heaving, her wide eyes<br> Mid dreams of far-off things grown wise,<br> The rock dropped down in her left hand;&#151;<br> There mazed awhile the men did stand,<br> Then gat them back. And so the sun<br> Waxed hot and waned, and, day nigh done,<br> Gleamed on the ship's side as she lay<br> Close in at deepest of the bay,<br> Her bridge gold-hung on either hand<br> Cast out upon the hard white sand;<br> While o&#146;er the bulwarks many a man<br> Gazed forth; and the great lord began<br> To fret and fume, till on the brow<br> Of the low cliff they saw her now,<br> Who stood a moment to behold<br> The ship's sun-litten flashing gold;<br> Then slowly &#146;gan to get her down<br> A steep path in the sea-cliff brown,<br> Till on a sudden did she meet<br> The slant sun cast about its feet,<br> And flashed as in a golden cloud;<br> Since scarcely her poor raiment showed<br> Beneath the glory of her hair,<br> Whose last lock touched her ankles bare.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For so it was that as she went<br> Unto this meeting, all intent<br> Upon the time that was to be, <A NAME="page_63"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 63</FONT></A><br> While yet just hidden from the sea,<br> She stayed her feet a little while,<br> And, gazing on her raiment vile,<br> Flushed red, and muttered,&#151;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who can tell<br> But I may love this great lord well?<br> An evil thing then should it be<br> If he cast loathing eyes on me<br> This first time for my vile attire."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, while her cheek still burned like fire,<br> She set hand to her hair of gold<br> Until its many ripples rolled<br> All over her, and no great queen<br> Was e&#146;er more gloriously beseen;<br> And thus she went upon her way.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when the crew beheld the may<br> Set foot upon the sand there rose<br> A mighty shout from midst of those<br> Rough seafarers; only the lord<br> Stood silent gazing overboard<br> With great eyes, till the bridge she gained,<br> And still the colour waxed and waned<br> Within his face; but when her foot<br> First pressed the plank, to his heart's root<br> Sweet pain there pierced, for her great eyes<br> Were fixed on his in earnest wise,<br> E&#146;en as her thoughts were all of him; <A NAME="page_64"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 64</FONT></A><br> And somewhat now all things waxed dim,<br> As unto her he stretched his hand,<br> And felt hers; and the twain did stand<br> Hearkening each other's eager breath.<br> But she was changed, for pale as death<br> She was now as she heard his voice.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Full well may we this eve rejoice,<br> Fair maid, that thou hast come to us;<br> That this grey shore and dolorous<br> Holds greater beauty than the earth<br> Mid fairer days may bring to birth,<br> And that I hold it now. But come<br> Unto the wind-blown woven home,<br> Where I have dwelt alone awhile,<br> And with thy speech the hours beguile."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For nothing he remembered<br> Of what his men unto him said,<br> That she was dumb. Not once she turned<br> Her eyes from his; the low sun burned<br> Within her waving hair, as she<br> Unto the poop went silently<br> Beside him, and with faltering feet,<br> Because this hour seemed over sweet,<br> And still his right hand held her hand.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when at last the twain did stand<br> Beneath the gold-hung tilt alone, <A NAME="page_65"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 65</FONT></A><br> He said, "Thou seemest such an one<br> As who could love; thou lookst on me<br> As though thou hopedst love might be<br> Betwixt us&#151;thou art pale, my sweet,<br> Good were it if our lips should meet."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then mouth to mouth long time they stood,<br> And when they sundered the red blood<br> Burnt in her cheek, and tenderly<br> Trembled her lips, and drew anigh<br> His lips again: but speech did break<br> Swiftly from out them, and she spake:<br> "May it be so, fair man, that thou<br> Art even no less happy now<br> Than I am."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a joyous cry<br> He caught her to him hastily;<br> And mid that kiss the sun went down,<br> And colder was the dark world grown.<br> Once more they parted; "Ah, my love,"<br> He said, "I knew not aught could move<br> My heart to such joy as thy speech."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She made as if she fain would reach<br> Her lips to his once more; but ere<br> They touched, as smitten by new fear,<br> She drew aback and said: "Alas!<br> It darkens, and I needs must pass<br> Back to the land, to be more sad <A NAME="page_66"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 66</FONT></A><br> Than if this joy I ne&#146;er had had.<br> And thou&#151;thou shalt be sorry too,<br> And pity me that it is so."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To-morrow morn comes back the day,"<br> He said, "If we should part, sweet may:<br> Yet why should I be left forlorn<br> Betwixt this even and the morn?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand had swept aback her hair,<br> And on her shoulder, gleaming bare<br> From midst her rags, was trembling now;<br> But she drew back, and o&#146;er her brow<br> Gathered a troubled thoughtful frown,<br> And on the bench she sat her down<br> And spake: "Nay, it were wise to bide<br> Awhile. Behold, the world is wide,<br> Yet have we found each other here,<br> And each to other seems more dear<br> Than all the world else.&#151;Yet a king<br> Thou art, and I am such a thing,<br> By some half-dreamed-of chance cast forth<br> To live a life of little worth,<br> A lonely life&#151;and it may be<br> That thou shouldst weary soon of me<br> If I abode here now&#151;and I,<br> How know I? All unhappily<br> My life has gone; scarce a kind word<br> Except in dreams my ears have heard <A NAME="page_67"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 67</FONT></A><br> But those thy lovely lips have said:<br> It might be when all things were weighed<br> That I too light of soul should prove<br> To hold for ever this great love."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down at her feet therewith he knelt,<br> And round her his strong arms she felt<br> Drawing her to him, as he said:<br> "These are strange words for thee, O maid;<br> Are those sweet loving lips grown cold<br> So soon? Yet art thou in my hold,<br> And certainly my heart is hot.<br> What help against me hast thou got?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each unto each their cheeks were laid,<br> As in a trembling voice she said:<br> "No help, because so dear to me<br> Thou art, and mighty as may be;<br> Thou hast seen much, art wiser far<br> Than I am; yet strange thoughts there are<br> In my mind now&#151;some half-told tale<br> Stirs in me, if I might avail<br> To tell it."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly she rose,<br> And thrust him from her; "Ah, too close!<br> Too close now, and too far apart<br> To-morrow!&#151;and a barren heart,<br> And days that ever fall to worse, <A NAME="page_68"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 68</FONT></A><br> And blind lives struggling with a curse<br> They cannot grasp! Look on my face,<br> Because I deem me of a race<br> That knoweth such a tale too well.<br> Yet if there be such tale to tell<br> Of us twain, let it e&#146;en be so,<br> Rather than we should fail to know<br> This love&#151;ah me, my love forbear!<br> No pain for thee and me I fear;<br> Yet strive we e&#146;en for more than this!<br> Thou who hast given me my first bliss<br> To-day, forgive me, that in turn<br> I see the pain within thee burn,<br> And may not help&#151;because mine eyes<br> The Gods make clear. I am grown wise<br> With gain of love, and hope of days<br> That many a coming age shall praise."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awhile he gazed on her, and shook<br> With passion, and his cloak's hem took<br> With both hands as to rend it down;<br> Yet from his brow soon cleared the frown:<br> He said: "Yea, such an one thou art,<br> As needs alone must fill my heart<br> If I be like my father's kin,<br> And have a hope great deeds to win;<br> And surely nought shall hinder me<br> From living a great life with thee&#151;<br> Say now what thou wouldst have me do." <A NAME="page_69"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 69</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some deed of fame thou goest to,"<br> She said, "for surely thou art great;<br> Go on thy way then, and if fate<br> So shapen is, that thou mayst come<br> Once more unto this lonely home,<br> There shalt thou find me, who will live<br> Through whatso days that fate may give,<br> Till on some happy coming day<br> Thine oars again make white the bay."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If that might be remembered now,"<br> He said, "last Yule I made a vow<br> In some far land to win me fame.<br> Come nigher, sweet, and hear my name<br> Before thou goest; that if so be<br> Death take me and my love from thee,<br> Thou mayst then think of who I was,<br> Nor let all memory of me pass<br> When thou to some great king art wed:<br> Then shalt thou say, 'Ragnar is dead,<br> Who was the son of Sigurd Ring,<br> Among the Danes a mighty king.<br> He might have had me by his side,'<br> Then shalt thou say, 'that hour he died;<br> But my heart failed and not his heart.'"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, make it not too hard to part,"<br> She said, when once again their lips<br> Had sundered; "as gold-bearing ships <A NAME="page_70"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 70</FONT></A><br> Foundered amidmost of the sea,<br> So shall the loves of most men be,<br> And leave no trace behind. God wot<br> This heart of mine shall hate thee not<br> Whatso befall; but rather bless<br> Thee and this hour of happiness;<br> And if this tide shall come again<br> After hard longing and great pain,<br> How sweet, how sweet! O love, farewell,<br> Lest other tale there be to tell:<br> Yet heed this now lest afterward<br> It seem to thee a thing too hard<br> To keep thy faith to such as me;<br> I am belike what thou dost see,<br> A goatherd girl, a peasant maid,<br> Of a poor wretched crone afraid<br> From dawn to dusk; despite of dreams<br> In morning tides, and misty gleams<br> Of wondrous stories, deem me such<br> As I have said, nor overmuch<br> Cast thou thy love upon my heart<br> If even such a man thou art<br> As needs must wed a great man's child."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped aback from her and smiled,<br> And, stooping &#146;neath the lamp, drew forth<br> From a great chest a thing of worth&#151;<br> A silken sark wrought wondrously<br> In some far land across the sea. <A NAME="page_71"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 71</FONT></A><br> "One thing this is of many such<br> That I were fain thy skin should touch,"<br> He said, "If thou wouldst have it so."<br> But his voice faltered and sank low,<br> As though her great heart he &#146;gan fear.<br> She reached her fine strong hand anear<br> The farfetched thing; then smiling said:<br> "Strange that such fair things can be made<br> By men who die; and like it is<br> Thou think&#146;st me worthy of all bliss;<br> But our rough hills and smoky house<br> Befit not aught so glorious,<br> E&#146;en if thou come again to me;<br> And if not, greater grief to see<br> The gifts of dead love!&#151;what say I,<br> Our crone should wear these certainly<br> If I but brought them unto land."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flushed red, and his strong right hand<br> Fell to his sword-hilt. "Nay," she said,<br> "All that is nought if rightly weighed;<br> Hope and desire shall pass the days<br> If thou come back."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grave was her face<br> And tremulous: he sighed; "Then take<br> This last gift only for my sake."<br> And once again their lips did touch<br> And cling together. "O many such,"<br> She said, "if the time did not fail, <A NAME="page_72"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 72</FONT></A><br> And my heart too: of what avail<br> Against the hand of fate to strive?<br> Let me begin my life to live,<br> As it must be a weary space."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon smote full upon her face,<br> As on a trembling sea, as now<br> From the lamp-litten gold tilt low<br> She stepped into the fresher air,<br> He with her. Slow the twain did fare<br> Amidst the wondering men, till they<br> Had reached the bridge; then swift away<br> She turned, and passed the gold-hung rail,<br> And o&#146;er the sands the moon made pale<br> Went gleaming, all alone: and he<br> Watched till her light feet steadily<br> Stepped up upon the dark cliff's brow:<br> But no one time she turned her now,<br> But vanished from him into night.<br> So there he watched till changing light<br> Brought the beginning of the tide<br> Of longing that he needs must bide;<br> Then he cried out for oars and sail,<br> And ere the morning star did fail<br> No more those cliffs his bird beheld,<br> As &#146;neath the wind the broad sail swelled. <A NAME="page_73"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 73</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>BUT for the maiden, back she went<br> Unto the stead, and her intent<br> She changed in nought: no word she spake<br> What wrath soe&#146;er on her might break<br> From the fell crone, on whom withal<br> Still heavier did that strange awe fall;<br> As well might be, for from the may<br> Had girlish lightness passed away<br> Into a sweet grave majesty,<br> That scarce elsewhere the world might see.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So wore the spring, and summer came,<br> And went, and all the woods did flame<br> With autumn, as in that old tide<br> When slowly by the mirk hill-side<br> Went Heimir to his unseen death:<br> Then came the first frost's windless breath,<br> The steaming sea, the world all white,<br> And glittering morn and silent night,<br> As when the little one first felt<br> The world a-cold; and still she dwelt<br> Unchanged since that first spark of love<br> Wrought the great change, that so did move<br> Her heart to perfect loveliness.<br> Nor overmuch did the days press<br> Upon her with the weary waste<br> Of short life, that too quick doth haste <A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A><br> When joy is gained: if any thought<br> Thereof unto her heart was brought,<br> Rather it was, "Ah, overlong<br> For brooding over change and wrong<br> When that shall come! Good gain to me<br> My love's eyes one more time to see,<br> To feel once more his lips&#146; delight,<br> And die with the short summer night,<br> Not shamed nor sorry! But if I<br> Must bear the weight of misery<br> In the after days, yet even then<br> May I not leave to unborn men<br> A savour of sweet things, a tale<br> That midst all woes shall yet prevail<br> To make the world seem something worth?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So passed the winter of the North,<br> And once again was come the spring;<br> Then whiles would she go loitering<br> Slow-footed, and with hanging head,<br> Through budding brake, o&#146;er flowery mead,<br> With blood that throbbed full quickly now<br> If o&#146;er the flowers her feet were slow,<br> And bonds about her seemed to be.<br> Yet wore the spring past lingeringly<br> Till on a morn of latter May,<br> When her soft sleep had passed away,<br> Nought but the bright-billed sweet-throat bird<br> Within the thorn at first she heard; <A NAME="page_75"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 75</FONT></A><br> But, even as her heart did meet<br> The first wave of desire o&#146;ersweet,<br> The winding of a mighty horn<br> Adown the breeze of May was borne,<br> And throbbing hope on her did fall:<br> Yet from her bed she leapt withal,<br> And clad herself, and went about<br> Her work, as though with ne&#146;er a doubt<br> That this day e&#146;en such like should be<br> As was the last; and so while she<br> Quickened the fire and laid the board,<br> Mid the crone's angry, querulous word<br> Of surly wonder, the goodman,<br> With axe on shoulder, swiftly ran<br> Adown the slope; but presently<br> Came breathless back:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, here they be!<br> Come back again for something worse,"<br> Said he. "This dumb maid is some curse<br> Laid on us."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," the goodwife said,<br> "Who be they?" "They who baked their bread<br> Within this house last spring," said he.<br> "Oft did I marvel then why she,<br> This witch-maid, went unto the strand<br> That eve."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, maybe comes to hand<br> Some luck," the crone said. "Hold thy peace,"<br> He said. "What goodhap or increase <A NAME="page_76"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 76</FONT></A><br> From that ill night shall ever come?<br> Rather I deem that now come home<br> Those fifteen years of murder: lo,<br> The worst of all we soon shall know,<br> I hear their voices."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently,<br> If somewhat pale, Aslaug passed by<br> From fire to board, as though she heard<br> And noted nothing of that word,<br> Whate&#146;er it was: yet now, indeed,<br> The clink of sword on iron weed,<br> And voices of the seafarers,<br> Came clear enow unto her ears;<br> Nor was it long or e&#146;er the door<br> Was darkened, as one stood before<br> The light and cried:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hail to this house,<br> If here still dwells the glorious<br> Fair maiden, that across the seas<br> We come for!"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aslaug on her knees<br> Knelt by the brightening fire and dropped<br> The meal into the pot, nor stopped<br> For all their words, but with her hand<br> Screened her fair face. Then up did stand<br> The goodman, quaking:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well," he said,<br> "Good be my meed! for we have fed<br> This dumb maid all for kindness&#146; sake." <A NAME="page_77"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 77</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No need," he said, "long words to make,<br> And little heed we thy lies now,<br> But if she doom thee to the bough.<br> &#151;All hail, our Lady and our Queen!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For she, arisen, with glorious mien<br> Was drawing near the board, and bare<br> The porridge-bowl and such-like gear<br> Past where the men stood; tremblingly<br> The leader of them drew anigh,<br> And would have taken them, but she<br> Swerved from his strong hand daintily,<br> Smiled on him and passed by, and when<br> They were set down turned back again<br> And spoke, and well then might rejoice<br> That dusky place to hear her voice<br> For the first time:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I doubt me not,<br> O seafarers, but ye have got<br> A message from that goodly lord<br> Who spake last year a pleasant word,<br> Hard to believe for a poor maid."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembled the twain at what she said<br> Less than the unexpected sound,<br> For death seemed in the air around.<br> But the man spake: "E&#146;en thus he saith,<br> That he, who heretofore feared death<br> In no-wise, feared this morn to come <A NAME="page_78"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 78</FONT></A><br> And seek thee out in thy poor home,<br> Lest he should find thee dead or gone;<br> For scarce he deemed so sweet a one<br> Could be for him: 'But if she live,'<br> He said, 'and still her love can give<br> To me, let her make no delay,<br> For fear we see no other day<br> Wherein to love.'"<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said: "Come, then!<br> It shames me not that of all men<br> I love him best. But have ye there<br> Somewhat these twain might reckon dear?<br> Their life is ill enow to live<br> But that withal they needs must strive<br> With griping want when I am gone."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He answered, "O thou goodly one,<br> Here have we many a dear-bought thing,<br> Because our master bade us bring<br> All queenly gear for thee, and deems<br> That thou, so clad as well beseems<br> That lovely body, wouldst aboard;<br> But all we have is at thy word<br> To keep or spend."<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, friends," she said,<br> "If thy lord loves my goodlihead,<br> Fain would I bear alone to him<br> What wealth I have of face or limb,<br> For him to deck when all is his, <A NAME="page_79"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 79</FONT></A><br> So full enow shall even this<br> That I am dight with be for me;<br> But since indeed of his bounty<br> He giveth unto me to give&#151;<br> Take ye this gold, ye twain, and live<br> E&#146;en as ye may&#151;small need to bless<br> Or curse your sordid churlishness,<br> Because methinks, without fresh curse,<br> Each day that comes shall still be worse<br> Than the past day, and worst of all<br> Your ending day on you shall fall.<br> Yet, if it may be, fare ye well,<br> Since in your house I came to dwell<br> A certain time of my life-days."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E&#146;en as she spake, her glorious face<br> Shone the last time on that abode,<br> And her light feet the daisies trod<br> Outside the threshold. But the twain<br> Stood 'mazed above the bounteous gain<br> Of rings and gems and money bright,<br> And a long while, for mere affright<br> And wonder, durst not handle it.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while the butterfly did flit<br> White round about the feet of her,<br> Above the little May-flowers fair,<br> She went adown the hill with these,<br> Until the low wash of the seas <A NAME="page_80"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 80</FONT></A><br> They heard, and murmuring of the men<br> Who manned the long-ships; quickly then<br> They showed above the grey bent's brow,<br> And all the folk beheld them now<br> &#146;Twixt oar and gunwale that abode,<br> And to the sky their shout rose loud.<br> But when upon the beach she came,<br> A bright thing in the sun did flame<br> &#146;Twixt sun and ship-side, and the sea<br> Foamed, as one waded eagerly<br> Unto the smooth and sea-beat sand,<br> And for one moment did she stand<br> Breathless, with beating heart, and then<br> To right and left drew back the men;<br> She heard a voice she deemed well known,<br> Long waited through dull hours bygone,<br> And round her mighty arms were cast:<br> But when her trembling red lips passed<br> From out the heaven of that dear kiss,<br> And eyes met eyes, she saw in his<br> Fresh pride, fresh hope, fresh love, and saw<br> The long sweet days still onward draw,<br> Themselves still going hand in hand,<br> As now they went adown the strand. <A NAME="page_81"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 81</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>NEXT morn, when they awoke to see<br> Each other's hands draw lovingly<br> Each unto each, awhile they lay<br> Silent, as though night passed away<br> They grudged full sore: till the King said<br> Unto the happy golden head<br> That lay upon his breast, "What thought<br> By those few hours of dark was brought<br> Unto thy heart, my love? Did dreams<br> Make strange thy loving sleep with gleams<br> Of changing days that yet may be?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She answered, but still dreamily:<br> "In sleep a little while ago<br> O&#146;er a star-litten world of snow<br> I fared, till suddenly nearby<br> A swirling fire blazed up on high;<br> Thereto I went, and without scathe<br> Passed through the flame, as one doth bathe<br> Within a summer stream, and there<br> I saw a golden palace fair<br> Ringed round about with roaring flame.<br> Unto an open door I came,<br> And entered a great hall thereby,<br> And saw where &#146;neath a canopy<br> A King and Queen there sat, more fair<br> Than the world knoweth otherwhere: <A NAME="page_82"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 82</FONT></A><br> And much methought my heart smiled then<br> Upon that goodliest of all men,<br> That sweetest of all womankind.<br> Then one methought a horn did wind<br> Without, and the King turned and spake:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Wherewith do the hall pillars shake,<br> O Queen, O love?'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She moved her head,<br> And in a voice like music said:<br> 'This is the fame of Ragnar's life,<br> The breath of all the glorious strife<br> Wherewith his days shall wear.'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he:<br> 'What is the shadow that I see<br> Adown the hall?'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then said the Queen:<br> 'Our daughter surely hadst thou seen<br> If thine eyes saw as clear as mine:<br> Well worth she is our love divine,<br> And unto Ragnar is she wed,<br> The best man since that thou wert dead,<br> My King, my love, mine own, mine own!'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then the twain kissed upon the throne,<br> And the dream passed and sleep passed too."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therewith the King her body drew<br> Nearer to him, if it might be, <A NAME="page_83"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 83</FONT></A><br> And spake: "A strange dream came to me.<br> Upon a waste at dawn I went<br> And wandered over vale and bent,<br> And ever was it dawn of day,<br> And still upon all sides there lay<br> The bones of men, and war-gear turned<br> To shards and rust; then far off burned<br> A fire, and thither quick I passed.<br> And when I came to it at last<br> Dreadful it seemed, impassable;<br> But I, fain of that land to tell<br> What things soever might be known,<br> Went round about, and up and down,<br> And gat no passing by the same;<br> Until, methought, just where the flame<br> Burned highest, through the midst I saw<br> A man and woman toward me draw,<br> Even as through a flowery wood:<br> So came they unto where I stood,<br> And glad at heart therewith I grew,<br> For such fair folk as were the two<br> Ne&#146;er had I seen; then the man cried:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Hail to thee, Ragnar! well betide<br> This dawn of day. Stretch forth thine hand.'</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"E&#146;en as he bade me did I stand,<br> Abiding what should hap, but he<br> Turned to the woman lovingly, <A NAME="page_84"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 84</FONT></A><br> And from her bosom's fresh delight<br> Drew forth a blooming lily white,<br> And set it in mine hand, and then<br> Both through the flame went back again.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then afterwards in earth I set<br> This lily, and with soft regret<br> Watched for its fading; but withal<br> Great light upon the world did fall,<br> And fair the sun rose o&#146;er the earth,<br> And blithe I grew and full of mirth:<br> And no more on a waste I was,<br> But in a green world, where the grass<br> White lily-blooms well-nigh did hide;<br> O&#146;er hill and valley far and wide<br> They waved in the warm wind; the sun<br> Seemed shining upon everyone,<br> As though it loved it: and with that<br> I woke, and up in bed I sat<br> And saw thee waking, O my sweet!"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that last word their lips did meet,<br> And even the fresh May morning bright<br> Was noted not in their delight.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let be&#151;as ancient stories tell<br> Full knowledge upon Ragnar fell<br> In lapse of time, that this was she<br> Begot in the felicity <A NAME="page_85"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 85</FONT></A><br> Swift-fleeting of the wondrous twain,<br> Who afterwards through change and pain<br> Must live apart to meet in death.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, would ye know what the tale saith,<br> In the old Danish tongue is writ<br> Full many a word concerning it,&#151;<br> The days through which these lovers passed,<br> Till death made end of all at last.<br> But so great Ragnar's glory seemed<br> To Northern folk, that many deemed<br> That for his death, when song arose<br> From that Northumbrian adder-close,<br> England no due atonement paid<br> Till Harald Godwinson was laid<br> Beside his fallen banner, cold<br> Upon the blood-soaked Sussex mould,<br> And o&#146;er the wrack of Senlac field<br> Full-fed the grey-nebbed raven wheeled. <A NAME="page_86"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 86</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>IN the dim place that the sun knew no more<br> He rose up when his tale was fully o&#146;er,<br> And &#146;gan to pace the long hall to and fro<br> With old eyes looking downward, e&#146;en as though<br> None else were there: at last with upraised face<br> He walked back swiftly to his fire-lit place,<br> And sat him down, and turned to the young folk<br> Smiling perforce; then from their lips outbroke<br> The murmuring speech his moody looks had stilled,<br> And with a sweet sound was the hall fulfilled;<br> E&#146;en like the noise that from the thin wood's side<br> Swims through the dawning day at April-tide<br> Across the speckled eggs, when from the brown<br> Soft feathers glittering eyes are looking down<br> Over the dewy meads, too fresh and fair<br> For aught but lovely feet to wander there.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drag on, long night of winter, in whose heart,<br> Nurse of regret, the dead spring yet has part!<br> Drag on, O night of dreams! O night of fears!<br> Fed by the summers of the bygone years!</p>
