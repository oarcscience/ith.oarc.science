### JANUARY.

FROM this dull rainy undersky and low,  
This murky ending of a leaden day,  
That never knew the sun, this half-thawed snow,  
These tossing black boughs faint against the grey  
Of gathering night, thou turnest, dear, away  
Silent, but with thy scarce-seen kindly smile  
Sent through the dusk my longing to beguile.

   There, the lights gleam, and all is dark without!  
And in the sudden change our eyes meet dazed—  
O look, love, look again! the veil of doubt  
Just for one flash, past counting, then was raised!  
O eyes of heaven, as clear thy sweet soul blazed  
On mine a moment! O come back again  
Strange rest and dear amid the long dull pain!

   Nay, nay, gone by! though there she sitteth still,  
With wide grey eyes so frank and fathomless—  
Be patient, heart, thy days they yet shall fill  
With utter rest—Yea, now thy pain they bless,  
And feed thy last hope of the world's redress—  
O unseen hurrying rack! O wailing wind!  
What rest and where go ye this night to find? <span id="page_88">p.

THE year has changed its name since that last tale;  
Yet nought the prisoned spring doth that avail.  
Deep buried under snow the country lies;  
Made dim by whirling flakes the rook still flies  
South-west before the wind; noon is as still  
As midnight on the southward-looking hill,  
Whose slopes have heard so many words and loud  
Since on the vine the woolly buds first showed.  
The raven hanging o’er the farmstead gate,  
While for another death his eye doth wait,  
Hears but the muffled sound of crowded byre  
And winds’ moan round the wall. Up in the spire  
The watcher set high o’er the half-hid town  
Hearkens the sound of chiming bells fall down  
Below him; and so dull and dead they seem  
That he might well-nigh be amidst a dream  
Wherein folk hear and hear not.  
                                  Such a tide,  
With all work gone from the hushed world outside,  
Still finds our old folk living, and they sit  
Watching the snow-flakes by the window flit  
Midmost the time ’twixt noon and dusk; till now  
One of the elders clears his knitted brow,  
And says:  
           "Well, hearken of a man who first  
In every place seemed doomed to be accursed; <span id="page_89">p.

To tell about his ill hap lies on me;  
Before the winter is quite o’er, maybe  
Some other mouth of his good hap may tell;  
But no third tale there is, of what befell  
His fated life, when he had won his place;  
And that perchance is not so ill a case  
For him and us; for we may rise up, glad  
At all the rest and triumph that he had  
Before he died; while he, forgetting clean  
The sorrow and the joy his eyes had seen,  
Lies quiet and well famed—and serves to-day  
To wear a space of winter-tide away."
