<p>Acrisius, the king of Argos, had already reached an advanced age without having male progeny. As he desired a son, he consulted the Delphian oracle, but this warned him against male descendants, and informed him that his daughter Dana&euml; would bear a son through whose hand he would perish. In order to prevent this, he had his daughter locked up in an iron tower, which he caused to be carefully guarded. But Zeus penetrated through the roof, in the guise of a golden shower, and Dana&euml; became the mother of a boy.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="#fn_46"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> One day Acrisius heard the voice of young Perseus in his daughter's room, and in this way learned that she had given birth to a child. <i>He killed the nurse</i>, but carried his daughter with her son to the domestic</p>

<p>altar of Zeus, to have an oath taken on the true father's name. But he refuses to believe his daughter's statement that Zeus is the father, and <i>he encloses her with the child in a box, which is cast into the sea</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_47"></A><A HREF="mbh09.htm#fn_47"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> The box is carried by the waves to the coast of Seriphos, where Dictys, <i>a fisherman</i>, usually called a brother of King Polydectes, <i>saves mother and child by drawing them out of the sea with his nets</i>. Dictys leads the two into his house and keeps them as his relations. Polydectes, however, becomes enamored of the beautiful mother, and <i>as Perseus was in his way, he tried to remove him</i> by sending him forth to fetch the head of the Gorgon Medusa. But against the king's anticipations Perseus accomplishes this difficult task, and a number of heroic deeds besides. Later, in throwing the discs during a contest, he accidentally kills his grandfather, as foretold by the oracle. He becomes the king of Argos, then of Tiryns, and the builder of Mycenae.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="mbh09.htm#fn_48"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

There it was found by Teuthras who made Auge his wife and took her child into his house as his foster son.</P>
