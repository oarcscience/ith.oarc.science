<p align="center">THE RETURN OF SONG</p>  
<p>"The swans are singing again," said to one another the gods. And looking downwards, for my dreams had taken me to some fair and far Valhalla, I saw below me an iridescent bubble not greatly larger than a star shine beautifully but faintly, and up and up from it looking larger and larger came a flock of white, innumerable swans, singing and singing and singing, till it seemed as though even the gods were wild ships swimming in music.</p>  
<p>"What is it?" I said to one that was humble among the gods.</p>  
<p>"Only a world has ended," he said to me, "and the swans are coming back to the gods returning the gift of song."</p>  
<p>"A whole world dead!" I said.</p>  
<p>"Dead," said he that was humble among the gods. "The worlds are not for ever; only song is immortal."</p>  
<p>"Look! Look!" he said. "There will be a new one soon."</p>  
<p>And I looked and saw the larks, going down from the gods.</p>
