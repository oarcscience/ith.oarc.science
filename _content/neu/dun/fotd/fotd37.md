THE FOOD OF DEATH

Death was sick. But they brought him bread that the modern bakers make,
whitened with alum, and the tinned meats of Chicago, with a pinch of our
modern substitute for salt. They carried him into the dining-room of a
great hotel (in that close atmosphere Death breathed more freely), and
there they gave him their cheap Indian tea. They brought him a bottle of
wine that they called champagne. Death drank it up. They brought a
newspaper and looked up the patent medicines; they gave him the foods
that it recommended for invalids, and a little medicine as prescribed in
the paper. They gave him some milk and borax, such as children drink in
England.

Death arose ravening, strong, and strode again through the cities.
