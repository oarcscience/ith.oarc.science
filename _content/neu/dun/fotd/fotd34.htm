<p align="center">TAKING UP PICADILLY</p>  
<p>Going down Picadilly one day and nearing Grosvenor Place I saw, if my memory is not at fault, some workmen with their coats off&#8212;or so they seemed. They had pickaxes in their hands and wore corduroy trousers and that little leather band below the knee that goes by the astonishing name of "York-to-London."</p>  
<p>They seemed to be working with peculiar vehemence, so that I stopped and asked one what they were doing.</p>  
<p>"We are taking up Picadilly," he said to me.</p>  
<p>"But at this time of year?" I said. "Is it usual in June?"</p>  
<p>"We are not what we seem," said he.</p>  
<p>"Oh, I see," I said, "you are doing it for a joke."</p>  
<p>"Well, not exactly that," he answered me.</p>  
<p>"For a bet?" I said.</p>  
<p>"Not precisely," said he.</p>  
<p>And then I looked at the bit that they had already picked, and though it was broad daylight over my head it was darkness down there, all full of the southern stars.</p>  
<p>"It was noisy and bad and we grew aweary of it," said he that wore corduroy trousers. "We are not what we appear."</p>  
<p>They were taking up Picadilly altogether.</p>
