THE THREE TALL SONS

And at last Man raised on high the final glory of his civilization, the
towering edifice of the ultimate city.

Softly beneath him in the deeps of the earth purred his machinery
fulfilling all his needs, there was no more toil for man. There he sat
at ease discussing the Sex Problem.

And sometimes painfully out of forgotten fields, there came to his outer
door, came to the furthest rampart of the final glory of Man, a poor old
woman begging. And always they turned her away. This glory of Man's
achievement, this city was not for her.

It was Nature that came thus begging in from the fields, whom they
always turned away.

And away she went again alone to her fields.

And one day she came again, and again they sent her hence. But her three
tall sons came too.

"These shall go in," she said. "Even these my sons to your city."

And the three tall sons went in.

And these are Nature's sons, the forlorn one's terrible children, War,
Famine and Plague.

Yea and they went in there and found Man unawares in his city still
poring over his Problems, obsessed with his civilization, and never
hearing their tread as those three came up behind.
