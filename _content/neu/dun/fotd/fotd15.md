THE LITTLE CITY

I was in the pre-destined 11.8 from Goraghwood to Drogheda, when I
suddenly saw the city. It was a little city in a valley, and only seemed
to have a little smoke, and the sun caught the smoke and turned it
golden, so that it looked like an old Italian picture where angels walk
in the foreground and the rest is a blaze of gold. And beyond, as one
could tell by the lie of land although one could not see through the
golden smoke, I knew that there lay the paths of the roving ships.

All round there lay a patchwork of small fields all over the slopes of
the hills, and the snow had come upon them tentatively, but already the
birds of the waste had moved to the sheltered places for every omen
boded more to fall. Far away some little hills blazed like an aureate
bulwark broken off by age and fallen from the earthward rampart of
Paradise. And aloof and dark the mountains stared unconcernedly
seawards.

And when I saw those grey and watchful mountains sitting where they sat
while the cities of the civilization of Araby and Asia arose like
crocuses, and like crocuses fell, I wondered for how long there would be
smoke in the valley and little fields on the hills.
