<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE HELL-RIDE OF BRYNHILD.</H1>
<P>After the death of Brynhild were made two bales, one for Sigurd, and that was first burned; but Brynhild was burned on the other, and she was in a chariot hung about with goodly hangings.</P>
<P>And so folk say that Brynhild drave in her chariot down along the way to Hell, and passed by an abode where dwelt a certain giantess, and the giantess spake:--</P>
<P>THE GIANT-WOMAN:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Nay, with my goodwill<BR>
Never goest thou<BR>
Through this stone-pillared<BR>
Stead of mine!<BR>
More seemly for thee<BR>
To sit sewing the cloth,<BR>
Than to go look on<BR>
The love of another.<BR>
"What dost thou, going<BR>
From the land of the Gauls,<BR>
O restless head,<BR>
To this mine house?<BR>
Golden girl, hast thou not,<BR>
If thou listest to hearken,<BR>
In sweet wise from thy hands<BR>
The blood of men washen?"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>BRYNHILD:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Nay, blame me naught,<BR>
Bride of the rock-hall,<BR>
Though I roved a warring<BR>
In the days that were;<BR>
The higher of us twain<BR>
Shall I ever be holden<BR>
When of our kind<BR>
Men make account."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>THE GIANT-WOMAN</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Thou, O Brynhild,<BR>
Budli's daughter,<BR>
Wert the worst ever born<BR>
Into the world;<BR>
For Giuki's children<BR>
Death hast thou gotten,<BR>
And turned to destruction<BR>
Their goodly dwelling."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>BRYNHILD:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"I shall tell thee<BR>
True tale from my chariot,<BR>
O thou who naught wottest,<BR>
If thou listest to wot;<BR>
How for me they have gotten<BR>
Those heirs of Giuki,<BR>
A loveless life,<BR>
A life of lies.<BR>
"Hild under helm,<BR>
The Hlymdale people,<BR>
E'en those who knew me,<BR>
Ever would call me.<BR>
"The changeful shapes<BR>
Of us eight sisters,<BR>
The wise king bade<BR>
Under oak-tree to bear;<BR>
Of twelve winters was I,<BR>
If thou listest to wot,<BR>
When I sware to the young lord<BR>
Oaths of love.<BR>
"Thereafter gat I<BR>
Mid the folk of the Goths,<BR>
For Helmgunnar the old,<BR>
Swift journey to Hell,<BR>
And gave to Aud's brother<BR>
The young, gain and glory;<BR>
Whereof overwrath<BR>
Waxed Odin with me.<BR>
"So he shut me in shield-wall<BR>
In Skata grove,<BR>
Red shields and white<BR>
Close set around me;<BR>
And bade him alone<BR>
My slumber to break<BR>
Who in no land<BR>
Knew how to fear.<BR>
"He set round my hall,<BR>
Toward the south quarter,<BR>
The Bane of all trees<BR>
Burning aloft;<BR>
And ruled that he only<BR>
Thereover should ride<BR>
Who should bring me the gold<BR>
O'er which Fafnir brooded.<BR>
"Then upon Grani rode<BR>
The goodly gold-strewer<BR>
To where my fosterer<BR>
Ruled his fair dwelling.<BR>
He who alone there<BR>
Was deemed best of all,<BR>
The War-lord of the Danes,<BR>
Well worthy of men.<BR>
"In peace did we sleep<BR>
Soft in one bed,<BR>
As though he had been<BR>
Naught but my brother:<BR>
There as we lay<BR>
Through eight nights wearing,<BR>
No hand in love<BR>
On each other we laid.<BR>
"Yet thence blamed me, Gudrun,<BR>
Giuki's daughter,<BR>
That I had slept<BR>
In the arms of Sigurd;<BR>
And then I wotted<BR>
As I fain had not wotted,<BR>
That they had bewrayed me<BR>
In my betrothals.<BR>
"Ah! For unrest<BR>
All too long<BR>
Are men and women<BR>
Made alive!<BR>
Yet we twain together<BR>
Shall wear through the ages,<BR>
Sigurd and I.--<BR>
Sink adown, O giant-wife!"</P></DIR>
