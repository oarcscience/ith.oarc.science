<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Of the Journey of the Giukings to King Atli.</H2>
<P>Now tells the tale of Gunnar, that in the same wise it fared with him; for when they awoke, Glaumvor his wife told him many dreams which seemed to her like to betoken guile coming; but Gunnar areded them all in other wise.</P>
<P>"This was one of them," said she; "methought a bloody sword was borne into the hall here, wherewith thou wert thrust through, and at either end of that wolves howled."</P>
<P>The king answered, "Our dogs shall bite me belike; blood-stained weapons oft betoken dogs' snappings."</P>
<P>She said, "Yet again I dreamed--that women came in, heavy and drooping, and chose thee for their mate; may-happen these would be thy fateful women."</P>
<P>He answered, "Hard to arede is this, and none may set aside the fated measure of his days, nor is it unlike that my time is short." [1]</P>
<P>So in the morning they arose, and were minded for the journey, but some letted them herein.</P>
<P>Then cried Gunnar to the man who is called Fjornir--</P>
<P>"Arise, and give us to drink goodly wine from great tuns, because may happen this shall be very last of all our feasts; belike if we die the old wolf shall come by the gold, and that bear shall nowise spare the bite of his war-tusks."</P>
<P>Then all the folk of his household brought them on their way weeping.</P>
<P>The son of Hogni said--</P>
<P>"Fare ye well with merry tide."</P>
<P>The more part of their folk were left behind; Solar and Gnoevar, the sons of Hogni, fared with them, and a great champion, named Orkning, who was the brother of Kostbera.</P>
<P>So folk followed them down to the ships, and all fetted them of their journey, but attained to naught therein.</P>
<P>Then spake Glaumvor, and said--</P>
<P>"O Vingi, most like that great ill hap will come of thy coming, and mighty and evil things shall betide in thy travelling."</P>
<P>He answered, "Hearken to my answer; that I lie not aught: and may the high gallows and all things of grame have me, if I lie one word!"</P>
<P>Then cried Kostbera, "Fare ye well with merry days."</P>
<P>And Hogni answered, "Be glad of heart, howsoever it may fare with us!"</P>
<P>And therewith they parted, each to their own fate. Then away they rowed, so hard and fast, that well-nigh the half of the keel slipped away from the ship, and so hard they laid on to the oars that thole and gunwale brake.</P>
<P>But when they came aland they made their ship fast, and then they rode awhile on their noble steeds through the murk wild-wood.</P>
<P>And now they behold the king's army, and huge uproar, and the clatter of weapons they hear from thence; and they see there a mighty host of men, and the manifold array of them, even as they wrought there: and all the gates of the burg were full of men.</P>
<P>So they rode up to the burg, and the gates thereof were shut; then Hogni brake open the gates, and therewith they ride into the burg.</P>
<P>Then spake Vingi, "Well might ye have left this deed undone; go to now, bide ye here while I go seek your gallows-tree! Softly and sweetly I base you hither, but an evil thing abode thereunder; short while to bide ere ye are tied up to that same tree!"</P>
<P>Hogni answered, "None the more shall we waver for that cause; for little methinks have we shrunk aback whenas men fell to fight; and naught shall it avail thee to make us afeard,--and for an ill fate hast thou wrought."</P>
<P>And therewith they cast him down to earth, and smote him with their axe-hammers till he died.</P>
