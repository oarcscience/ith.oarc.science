# The Story of the Volsungs

### (Volsunga Saga),

#### with Excerpts from the Poetic Edda.

##### Anonymous Old Norse and Icelandic Mythologies

Originally written in Icelandic (Old Norse) in the thirteenth century
A.D., by an unknown hand. However, most of the material is based
substantially on previous works, some centuries older. A few of these
works have been preserved in the collection of Norse poetry known as the
"Poetic Edda".

The text of this edition is based on that published as "The Story of the
Volsungs", translated by William Morris and Eirikr Magnusson (Walter
Scott Press, London, 1888).

This electronic edition was edited, proofed, and prepared by Douglas B.
Killings.
