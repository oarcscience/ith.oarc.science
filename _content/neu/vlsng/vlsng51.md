# THE SECOND OR ANCIENT LAY OF GUDRUN.

Thiodrek the King was in Atli's house, and had lost there the more part
of his men: so there Thiodrek and Gudrun bewailed their troubles one to
the other, and she spake and said:--

A may of all mays  
My mother reared me  
Bright in bower;  
Well loved I my brethren,  
Until that Giuki  
With gold arrayed me,  
With gold arrayed me,  
And gave me to Sigurd.  
Such was my Sigurd,  
Among the sons of Giuki  
As is the green leek  
O'er the low grass waxen,  
Or a hart high-limbed  
Over hurrying deer,  
Or glede-red gold  
Over grey silver.  
Till me they begrudged,  
Those my brethren,  
The fate to have him,  
Who was first of all men;  
Nor might they sleep,  
Nor sit a-dooming,  
Ere they let slay  
My well-loved Sigurd.  
Grani ran to the Thing,  
There was clatter to hear,  
But never came Sigurd  
Himself thereunto;  
All the saddle-girt beasts  
With blood were besprinkled,  
As faint with the way  
Neath the slayers they went.  
Then greeting I went  
With Grani to talk,  
And with tear-furrowed cheeks  
I bade him tell all;  
But drooping laid Grani,  
His head in the grass,  
For the steed well wotted  
Of his master's slaying.  
A long while I wandered,  
Long my mind wavered,  
Ere the kings I might ask  
Concerning my king.  
Then Gunnar hung head,  
But Hogni told  
Of the cruel slaying  
Of my Sigurd:  
"On the water's far side  
Lies, smitten to death,  
The bane of Guttorm  
To the wolves given over.  
"Go, look on Sigurd,  
On the ways that go southward,  
There shalt thou hear  
The ernes high screaming,  
The ravens a-croaking  
As their meat they crave for;  
Thou shalt hear the wolves howling  
Over thine husband.  
"How hast thou, Hogni,  
The heart to tell me,  
Me of joy made empty,  
Of such misery?  
Thy wretched heart  
May the ravens tear  
Wide over the world,  
With no men mayst thou wend."  
One thing Hogni  
Had for answer,  
Fallen from his high heart,  
Full of all trouble:  
"More greeting yet,  
O Gudrun, for thee,  
If my heart the ravens  
Should rend asunder!"  
Thence I turned  
From the talk and the trouble  
To go a leasing \[1\]  
What the wolves had left me;  
No sigh I made  
No smote hands together,  
Nor did I wail  
As other women  
When I sat over  
My Sigurd slain.  
Night methought it,  
And the moonless dark,  
When I sat in sorrow  
Over Sigurd;  
Better than all things  
I deemed it would be  
If they would let me  
Cast my life by,  
Or burn me up  
As they burn the birch-wood.  
From the fell I wandered  
Five days together,  
Until the high hall  
Of Half lay before me;  
Seven seasons there  
I sat with Thora,  
The daughter of Hacon,  
Up in Denmark.  
My heart to gladden  
With gold she wrought  
Southland halls  
And swans of the Dane-folk;  
There had we painted  
The chiefs a-playing;  
Fair our hands wrought  
Folk of the kings.  
Red shields we did,  
Doughty knights of the Huns,  
Hosts spear-dight, hosts helm-dight,  
All a high king's fellows;  
And the ships of Sigmund  
From the land swift sailing;  
Heads gilt over  
And prows fair graven.  
On the cloth we broidered  
That tide of their battling,  
Siggeir and Siggar,  
South in Fion.  
Then heard Grimhild,  
The Queen of Gothland,  
How I was abiding,  
Weighed down with woe;  
And she thrust the cloth from her  
And called to her sons,  
And oft and eagerly  
Asked them thereof,  
Who for her son  
Would their sister atone,  
Who for her lord slain  
Would lay down weregild.  
Fain was Gunnar  
Gold to lay down  
All wrongs to atone for,  
And Hogni in likewise;  
Then she asked who was fain  
Of faring straightly,  
The steed to saddle  
To set forth the wain,  
The horse to back,  
And the hawk to fly,  
To shoot forth the arrow  
From out the yew-bow.  
Valdarr the Dane-king  
Came with Jarisleif  
Eymod the third went  
Then went Jarizskar;  
In kingly wise  
In they wended,  
The host of the Longbeards;  
Red cloaks had they,  
Byrnies short-cut,  
Helms strong hammered,  
Girt with glaives,  
And hair red-gleaming.  
Each would give me  
Gifts desired,  
Gifts desired,  
Speech dear to my heart,  
If they might yet,  
Despite my sorrow,  
Win back my trust,  
But in them nought I trusted.  
Then brought me Grimhild  
A beaker to drink of,  
Cold and bitter,  
Wrong's memory to quench;  
Made great was that drink  
With the might of the earth,  
With the death-cold sea  
And the blood that Son \[2\] holdeth.  
On that horn's face were there  
All the kin of letters  
Cut aright and reddened,  
How should I rede them rightly?  
The ling-fish long  
Of the land of Hadding,  
Wheat-ears unshorn,  
And wild things' inwards.  
In that mead were mingled  
Many ills together,  
Blood of all the wood,  
And brown-burnt acorns;  
The black dew of the hearth, \[3\]  
And god-doomed dead beasts' inwards  
And the swine's liver sodden,  
For wrongs late done that deadens.  
Then waned my memory  
When that was within me,  
Of my lord 'mid the hall  
By the iron laid low.  
Three kings came  
Before my knees  
Ere she herself  
Fell to speech with me.  
"I will give to thee, Gudrun,  
Gold to be glad with,  
All the great wealth  
Of thy father gone from us,  
Rings of red gold  
And the great hall of Lodver,  
And all fair hangings left  
By the king late fallen.  
"Maids of the Huns  
Woven pictures to make,  
And work fair in gold  
Till thou deem'st thyself glad.  
Alone shalt thou rule  
O'er the riches of Budli,  
Shalt be made great with gold,  
And be given to Atli."  
"Never will I  
Wend to a husband,  
Or wed the brother  
Of Queen Brynhild;  
Naught it beseems me  
With the son of Budli  
Kin to bring forth,  
Or to live and be merry."  
"Nay, the high chiefs  
Reward not with hatred,  
For take heed that I  
Was the first in this tale!  
To thy heart shall it be  
As if both these had life,  
Sigurd and Sigmund,  
When thou hast borne sons."  
"Naught may I, Grimhild,  
Seek after gladness,  
Nor deem aught hopeful  
Of any high warrior,  
Since wolf and raven  
Were friends together,  
The greedy, the cruel,  
O'er great Sigurd's heart-blood."  
"Of all men that can be  
For the noblest of kin  
This king have I found,  
And the foremost of all;  
Him shalt thou have  
Till with eld thou art heavy--  
Be thou ever unwed,  
If thou wilt naught of him!"  
"Nay, nay, bid me not  
With thy words long abiding  
To take unto me  
That balefullest kin;  
This king shall bid Gunnar  
Be stung to his bane,  
And shall cut the heart  
From out of Hogni.  
"Nor shall I leave life  
Ere the keen lord,  
The eager in sword-play,  
My hand shall make end of."  
Grimhild a-weeping  
Took up the word then,  
When the sore bale she wotted  
Awaiting her sons,  
And the bane hanging over  
Her offspring beloved.  
"I will give thee, moreover,  
Great lands, many men,  
Wineberg and Valberg,  
If thou wilt but have them;  
Hold them lifelong,  
And live happy, O daughter!"  
"Then him must I take  
From among kingly men,  
'Gainst my heart's desire,  
From the hands of my kinsfolk;  
But no joy I look  
To have from that lord:  
Scarce may my brother's bane  
Be a shield to my sons."  
Soon was each warrior  
Seen on his horse,  
But the Gaulish women  
Into wains were gotten;  
Then seven days long  
O'er a cold land we rode,  
And for seven other  
Clove we the sea-waves.  
But with the third seven  
O'er dry land we wended.  
There the gate-wardens  
Of the burg, high and wide,  
Unlooked the barriers  
Ere the burg-garth we rode to--  
Atli woke me  
When meseemed I was  
Full evil of heart  
For my kin dead slain.  
"In such wise did the Norns  
Wake me or now."--  
Fain was he to know  
Of this ill foreshowing--  
"That methought, O Gudrun,  
Giuki's daughter,  
That thou setst in my heart  
A sword wrought for guile."  
"For fires tokening I deem it  
That dreaming of iron,  
But for pride and for lust  
The wrath of fair women  
Against some bale  
Belike, I shall burn thee  
For thy solace and healing  
Though hateful thou art."  
"In the fair garth methought  
Had saplings fallen  
E'en such as I would  
Should have waxen ever;  
Uprooted were these,  
And reddened with blood,  
And borne to the bench,  
And folk bade me eat of them.  
"Methought from my hand then  
Went hawks a-flying  
Lacking their meat  
To the land of all ill;  
Methought that their hearts  
Mingled with honey,  
Swollen with blood  
I ate amid sorrow.  
"Lo, next two whelps  
From my hands I loosened,  
Joyless were both,  
And both a-howling;  
And now their flesh  
Became naught but corpses,  
Whereof must I eat  
But sore against my will."  
"O'er the prey of the fishers  
Will folk give doom;  
From the bright white fish  
The heads will they take;  
Within a few nights,  
Fey as they are,  
A little ere day  
Of that draught will they eat."  
"Ne'er since lay I down,  
Ne'er since would I sleep,  
Hard of heart, in my bed:--  
That deed have I to do. \[4\]

ENDNOTES:

\[1\] The original has "a vid lesa". "Leasing" is the word still used
for gleaning in many country sides in England.

\[2\] Son was the vessel into which was poured the blood of Quasir, the
God of Poetry.

\[3\] This means soot.

\[4\] The whole of this latter part is fragmentary and obscure; there
seems wanting to two of the dreams some trivial interpretation by
Gudrun, like those given by Hogni to Kostbera in the Saga, of which
nature, of course, the interpretation contained in the last stanza but
one is, as we have rendered it: another rendering, from the different
reading of the earlier edition of "Edda" (Copenhagen, 1818) would make
this refer much more directly to the slaying of her sons by Gudrun.
