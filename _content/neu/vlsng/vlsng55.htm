<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE LAMENT OF ODDRUN.</H1>
<P>There was a king hight Heidrik, and his daughter was called Borgny, and the name of her lover was Vilmund. Now she might nowise be made lighter of a child she travailed with, before Oddrun, Atil's sister, came to her,--she who had been the love of Gunnar, Giuki's son. But of their speech together has this been sung:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I have hear tell<BR>
In ancient tales<BR>
How a may there came<BR>
To Morna-land,<BR>
Because no man<BR>
On mould abiding<BR>
For Heidrik's daughter<BR>
Might win healing.<BR>
All that heard Oddrun,<BR>
Atil's sister,<BR>
How that the damsel<BR>
Had heavy sickness,<BR>
So she led from stall<BR>
Her bridled steed,<BR>
And on the swart one<BR>
Laid the saddle.<BR>
She made her horse wend<BR>
O'er smooth ways of earth,<BR>
Until to a high-built<BR>
Hall she came;<BR>
Then the saddle she had<BR>
From the hungry horse,<BR>
And her ways wended<BR>
In along the wide hall,<BR>
And this word first<BR>
Spake forth therewith:<BR>
"What is most famed,<BR>
Afield in Hunland,<BR>
Or what may be<BR>
Blithest in Hunland?"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>QUOTH THE HANDMAID:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Here lieth Borgny,<BR>
Borne down by trouble,<BR>
Thy sweet friend, O Oddrun,<BR>
See to her helping!"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ODDRUN SAID:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Who of the lords<BR>
Hath laid this grief on her,<BR>
Why is the anguish<BR>
Of Borgny so weary?"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>THE HANDMAID SAID:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"He is hight Vilmund,<BR>
Friend of hawk-bearers,<BR>
He wrapped the damsel<BR>
In the warm bed-gear<BR>
Five winters long<BR>
Without her father's wotting."<BR>
No more than this<BR>
They spake methinks;<BR>
Kind sat she down<BR>
By the damsel's knee;<BR>
Mightily sand Oddrun,<BR>
Sharp piercing songs<BR>
By Borgny's side:<BR>
Till a maid and a boy<BR>
Might tread on the world's ways,<BR>
Blithe babes and sweet<BR>
Of Hogni's bane:<BR>
Then the damsel forewearied<BR>
The word took up,<BR>
The first word of all<BR>
That had won from her:<BR>
"So may help thee<BR>
All helpful things,<BR>
Fey and Freyia,<BR>
And all the fair Gods,<BR>
As thou hast thrust<BR>
This torment from me!"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ODDRUN SAID:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Yet no heart had I<BR>
For thy helping,<BR>
Since never wert thou<BR>
Worthy of helping,<BR>
But my word I held to,<BR>
That of old was spoken<BR>
When the high lords<BR>
Dealt out the heritage,<BR>
That every soul<BR>
I would ever help."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>BORGNY SAID:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Right mad art thou, Oddrun,<BR>
And reft of thy wits,<BR>
Whereas thou speakest<BR>
Hard words to me<BR>
Thy fellow ever<BR>
Upon the earth<BR>
As of brothers twain,<BR>
We had been born."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>ODDRUN SAID:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Well I mind me yet,<BR>
What thou saidst that evening,<BR>
Whenas I bore forth<BR>
Fair drink for Gunnar;<BR>
Such a thing, saidst thou,<BR>
Should fall out never,<BR>
For any may<BR>
Save for me alone."<BR>
Mind had the damsel<BR>
Of the weary day<BR>
Whenas the high lords<BR>
Dealt out the heritage,<BR>
And she sat her down,<BR>
The sorrowful woman,<BR>
To tell of the bale,<BR>
And the heavy trouble.<BR>
"Nourished was I<BR>
In the hall of kings--<BR>
Most folk were glad--<BR>
'Mid the council of great ones:<BR>
In fair life lived I,<BR>
And the wealth of my father<BR>
For five winters only,<BR>
While yet he had life.<BR>
"Such were the last words<BR>
That ever he spake,<BR>
The king forewearied,<BR>
Ere his ways he went;<BR>
For be bade folk give me<BR>
The gold red-gleaming,<BR>
And give me in Southlands<BR>
To the son of Grimhild.<BR>
"But Brynhild he bade<BR>
To the helm to betake her,<BR>
And said that Death-chooser<BR>
She should become;<BR>
And that no better<BR>
Might ever be born<BR>
Into the world,<BR>
If fate would not spoil it.<BR>
"Brynhild in bower<BR>
Sewed at her broidery,<BR>
Folk she had<BR>
And fair lands about her;<BR>
Earth lay a-sleeping,<BR>
Slept the heavens aloft<BR>
When Fafnir's-bane<BR>
The burg first saw.<BR>
"Then was war waged<BR>
With the Welsh-wrought sword<BR>
And the burg all broken<BR>
That Brynhild owned;<BR>
Nor wore long space,<BR>
E'en as well might be,<BR>
Ere all those wiles<BR>
Full well she knew.<BR>
"Hard and dreadful<BR>
Was the vengeance she drew down,<BR>
So that all we<BR>
Have woe enow.<BR>
Through all lands of the world<BR>
Shall that story fare forth<BR>
How she did her to death<BR>
For the death of Sigurd.<BR>
"But therewithal Gunnar<BR>
The gold-scatterer<BR>
Did I fall to loving<BR>
And should have loved him.<BR>
Rings of red gold<BR>
Would they give to Atli,<BR>
Would give to my brother<BR>
Things goodly and great.<BR>
"Yea, fifteen steads<BR>
Would they give for me,<BR>
And the load of Grani<BR>
To have as a gift;<BR>
But then spake Atli,<BR>
That such was his will,<BR>
Never gift to take<BR>
From the sons of Giuki.<BR>
"But we in nowise<BR>
Might love withstand,<BR>
And mine head must I lay<BR>
On my love, the ring-breaker;<BR>
And many there were<BR>
Among my kin,<BR>
Who said that they<BR>
Had seen us together.<BR>
"Then Atli said<BR>
That I surely never<BR>
Would fall to crime<BR>
Or shameful folly:<BR>
But now let no one<BR>
For any other,<BR>
That shame deny<BR>
Where love has dealing.<BR>
"For Atli sent<BR>
His serving-folk<BR>
Wide through the murkwood<BR>
Proof to win of me,<BR>
And thither they came<BR>
Where they ne'er should have come,<BR>
Where one bed we twain<BR>
Had dight betwixt us.<BR>
"To those men had we given<BR>
Rings of red gold,<BR>
Naught to tell<BR>
Thereof to Atli,<BR>
But straight they hastened<BR>
Home to the house,<BR>
And all the tale<BR>
To Atli told.<BR>
'Whereas from Gudrun<BR>
Well they hid it,<BR>
Though better by half<BR>
Had she have known it.</P>
<P>"Din was there to hear<BR>
Of the hoofs gold-shod,<BR>
When into the garth<BR>
Rode the sons of Giuki.<BR>
"There from Hogni<BR>
The heart they cut,<BR>
But into the worm-close<BR>
Cast the other.<BR>
There the king, the wise-hearted,<BR>
Swept his harp-strings,<BR>
For the might king<BR>
Had ever mind<BR>
That I to his helping<BR>
Soon should come.<BR>
"But now was I gone<BR>
Yet once again<BR>
Unto Geirmund,<BR>
Good feast to make;<BR>
Yet had I hearing,<BR>
E'en out from Hlesey,<BR>
How of sore trouble<BR>
The harp-strings sang.<BR>
"So I bade the bondmaids<BR>
Be ready swiftly,<BR>
For I listed to save<BR>
The life of the king,<BR>
And we let our ship<BR>
Swim over the sound,<BR>
Till Atli's dwelling<BR>
We saw all clearly.<BR>
Then came the wretch [1]<BR>
Crawling out,<BR>
E'en Atli's mother,<BR>
All sorrow upon her!<BR>
A grave gat her sting<BR>
In the heart of Gunnar,<BR>
So that no helping<BR>
Was left for my hero.<BR>
"O gold-clad woman,<BR>
Full oft I wonder<BR>
How I my life<BR>
Still hold thereafter,<BR>
For methought I loved<BR>
That light in battle,<BR>
The swift with the sword,<BR>
As my very self.<BR>
"Thou hast sat and hearkened<BR>
As I have told thee<BR>
Of many an ill-fate,<BR>
Mine and theirs--<BR>
Each man liveth<BR>
E'en as he may live--<BR>
Now hath gone forth<BR>
The greeting of Oddrun."</P></DIR>
