<P>Now this is my first counsel,<BR>
That thou with thy kin<BR>
Be guiltless, guileless ever,<BR>
Nor hasty of wrath,<BR>
Despite of wrong done--<BR>
Unto the dead good that doeth.<BR>
Lo the second counsel,<BR>
That oath thou swearest never,<BR>
But trusty oath and true:<BR>
Grim tormenting<BR>
Gripes troth-breakers;<BR>
Cursed wretch is the wolf of vows.<BR>
This is my third rede,<BR>
That thou at the Thing<BR>
Deal not with the fools of folk;<BR>
For unwise man<BR>
From mouth lets fall<BR>
Worser word than well he wotteth.<BR>
Yet hard it is<BR>
That holding of peace<BR>
When men shall deem thee dastard,<BR>
Or deem the lie said soothly;<BR>
But woeful is home-witness,<BR>
Unless right good thou gettest it.<BR>
Ah, on another day<BR>
Drive the life from out him,<BR>
And pay the liar back for his lying.<BR>
Now behold the fourth rede:<BR>
If ill witch thee bideth,<BR>
Woe-begatting by the way,<BR>
Good going further<BR>
Rather than guesting,<BR>
Though thick night be on thee.<BR>
Far-seeing eyes<BR>
Need all sons of men<BR>
Who wend in wrath to war;<BR>
For baleful women<BR>
Bide oft by the highway,<BR>
Swords and hearts to soften.<BR>
And now the fifth rede:<BR>
As fair as thou seest<BR>
Brides on the bench abiding,<BR>
Let not love's silver<BR>
Rule over thy sleeping;<BR>
Draw no woman to kind kissing!<BR>
For the sixth thing, I rede<BR>
When men sit a-drinking<BR>
Amid ale-words and ill-words,<BR>
Dead thou naught<BR>
With the drunken fight-staves<BR>
For wine stealeth wit from many.<BR>
Brawling and drink<BR>
Have brought unto men<BR>
Sorrow sore oft enow;<BR>
Yea, bane unto some,<BR>
And to some weary bale;<BR>
Many are the griefs of mankind.<BR>
For the seventh, I rede thee,<BR>
If strife thou raisest<BR>
With a man right high of heart,<BR>
Better fight a-field<BR>
Than burn in the fire<BR>
Within thine hall fair to behold.<BR>
The eighth rede that I give thee:<BR>
Unto all ill look thou,<BR>
And hold thine heart from all beguiling;<BR>
Draw to thee no maiden,<BR>
No man's wife bewray thou,<BR>
Urge them not unto unmeet pleasure.<BR>
This is the ninth counsel:<BR>
That thou have heed of dead folk Whereso thou findest them a-field;<BR>
Be they sick-dead,<BR>
Be they sea-dead,<BR>
Or come to ending by war-weapons.<BR>
Let bath be made<BR>
For such men fordone,<BR>
Wash thou hands and feet thereof,<BR>
Comb their hair and dry them<BR>
Ere the coffin has them;<BR>
Then bid them sleep full sweetly.<BR>
This for the tenth counsel:<BR>
That thou give trust never<BR>
Unto oaths of foeman's kin,<BR>
Be'st thou bane of his brother,<BR>
Or hast thou felled his father;<BR>
Wolf in young son waxes,<BR>
Though he with gold be gladdened.<BR>
For wrong and hatred<BR>
Shall rest them never,<BR>
Nay, nor sore sorrow.<BR>
Both wit and weapons<BR>
Well must the king have<BR>
Who is fain to be the foremost.<BR>
The last rede and eleventh:<BR>
Until all ill look thou.<BR>
And watch thy friends' ways ever<BR>
Scarce durst I look<BR>
For long life for thee, king:<BR>
Strong trouble ariseth now already.</P></DIR>
