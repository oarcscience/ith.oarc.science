# CHAPTER XXIII.

## Sigurd comes to Hlymdale.

Forth Sigurd fides till he comes to a great and goodly dwelling, the
lord whereof was a mighty chief called Heimir; he had to wife a sister
of Brynhild, who was hight Bekkhild, because she had bidden at home, and
learned handicraft, whereas Brynhild fared with helm and byrny, unto the
wars, wherefore was she called Brynhild.

Heimir and Bekkhild had a son called Alswid, the most courteous of men.

Now at this stead were men disporting them abroad, but when they see the
man riding thereto, they leave their play to wonder at him, for none
such had they ever seen erst, so they went to meet him, and gave him
good welcome. Alswid bade him abide and have such things at his hands as
he would; and he takes his bidding blithesomely; due service withal was
established for him; four men bore the treasure of gold from off the
horse, and the fifth took it to him to guard the same; therein were many
things to behold, things of great price, and seldom seen; and great game
and joy men had to look on byrnies and helms, and mighty rings, and
wondrous great golden stoups, and all kinds of war weapons.

So there dwelt Sigurd long in great honour holden; and tidings of that
deed of fame spread wide through all lands, of how he had slain that
hideous and fearful dragon. So good joyance had they there together, and
each was leal to other; and their sport was in the arraying of their
weapons, and the shafting of their arrows, and the flying of their
falcons.
