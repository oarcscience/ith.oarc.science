# THE SONG OF ATLI.

Gudrun, Giuki's daughter, avenger her brethren, as is told far and wide;
first she slew the sons of Atli, and then Atli himself; and she burned
the hall thereafter, and all the household with it: and about these
matters is this song made:--

In days long gone  
Sent Atli to Gunnar  
A crafty one riding,  
Knefrud men called him;  
To Giuki's garth came he,  
To the hall of Gunnar,  
To the benches gay-dight,  
And the gladsome drinking.  
There drank the great folk  
'Mid the guileful one's silence,  
Drank wine in their fair hall:  
The Huns' wrath they feared  
When Knefrud cried  
In his cold voice,  
As he sat on the high seat,  
That man of the Southland:  
"Atli has sent me  
Riding swift on his errands  
On the bit-griping steed  
Through dark woodways unbeaten,  
To bid thee, King Gunnar,  
Come to his fair bench  
With helm well-adorned,  
To the house of King Atli.  
"Shield shall ye have there  
And spears ashen-shafted,  
Helms ruddy with gold,  
And hosts of the Huns;  
Saddle-gear silver gilt,  
Shirts red as blood,  
The hedge of the warwife,  
And horses bit-griping.  
"And he saith he will give you  
Gnitaheath widespread,  
And whistling spears  
And prows well-gilded,  
Might wealth  
With the stead of Danpi,  
And that noble wood  
Men name the Murkwood."  
Then Gunnar turned head  
And spake unto Hogni:  
"What rede from thee, high one,  
Since such things we hear?  
No gold know I  
On Gnitaheath,  
That we for our parts  
Have not portion as great.  
"Seven halls we have  
Fulfilled of swords,  
And hilts of gold  
Each sword there has;  
My horse is the best,  
My blade is the keenest;  
Fair my bow o'er the bench is,  
Gleams my byrny with gold;  
Brightest helm, brightest shield,  
From Kiar's dwelling ere brought--  
Better all things I have  
Than all things of the Huns."

HOGNI SAID:

"What mind has our sister  
That a ring she hath sent us  
In weed of wolves clad?  
Bids she not to be wary?  
For a wolf's hair I found  
The fair ring wreathed about;  
Wolf beset shall the way be  
If we wend on this errand."  
No sons whetted Gunnar,  
Nor none of his kin,  
Nor learned men nor wise men,  
Nor such as were mighty.  
Then spake Gunnar  
E'en as a king should speak,  
Glorious in mead-hall  
From great heart and high:  
"Rise up now, Fiornir,  
Forth down the benches  
Let the gold-cups of great ones  
Pass in hands of my good-men!  
Well shall we drink wine,  
Draughts dear to our hearts,  
Though the last of all feasts  
In our fair house this be!  
"For the wolves shall rule  
O'er the wealth of the Niblungs,  
With the pine-woods' wardens  
In Gunnar perish:  
And the black-felled bears  
With fierce teeth shall bite  
For the glee of the dog kind,  
If again comes not Gunnar."  
Then good men never shamed,  
Greeting aloud,  
Led the great king of men  
From the garth of his home;  
And cried the fair son  
Of Hogni the king:  
"Fare happy, O Lords,  
Whereso your hearts lead you!"  
Then the bold knights  
Let their bit-griping steeds  
Wend swift o'er the fells,  
Tread the murk-wood unknown,  
All the Hunwood was shaking  
As the hardy ones fared there;  
O'er the green meads they urged  
Their steeds shy of the goad.  
Then Atli's land saw they;  
Great towers and strong,  
And the bold men of Bikki,  
Aloft on the burg:  
The Southland folks' hall  
Set with benches about,  
Dight with bucklers well bounden,  
And bright white shining shields.  
There drank Atli,  
The awful Hun king,  
Wine in his fair hall;  
Without were the warders,  
Gunnar's folk to have heed of,  
Lest they had fared thither  
With the whistling spear  
War to wake 'gainst the king.  
But first came their sister  
As they came to the hall,  
Both her brethren she met,  
With beer little gladdened:  
"Bewrayed art thou, Gunnar!  
What dost thou great king  
To deal war to the Huns?  
Go thou swift from the hall!  
Better, brother, hadst thou  
Fared here in thy byrny  
Than with helm gaily dight  
Looked on Atli's great house:  
Them hadst sat then in saddle  
Through days bright with the sun  
Fight to awaken  
And fair fields to redden:  
"O'er the folk fate makes pale  
Should the Norn's tears have fallen,  
The shield mays of the Huns  
Should have known of all sorrow;  
And King Atli himself  
To worm-close should be brought;  
But now is the worm-close  
Kept but for thee."  
Then spake Gunnar  
Great 'mid the people:  
"Over-late sister  
The Niblungs to summon;  
A long way to seek  
The helping of warriors,  
The high lord unshamed,  
From the hills of the Rhine!"  
Seven Hogni beat down  
With his sword sharp-grinded,  
And the eighth man he thrust  
Amidst of the fire.  
Ever so shall famed warrior  
Fight with his foemen,  
As Hogni fought  
For the hand of Gunnar.  
But on Gunnar they fell,  
And set him in fetters,  
And bound hard and fast  
That friend of Burgundians;  
Then the warrior they asked  
If he would buy life,  
But life with gold  
That king of the Goths.  
Nobly spake Gunnar,  
Great lord of the Niblungs;  
"Hogni's bleeding heart first  
Shall lie in mine hand,  
Cut from the breast  
Of the bold-riding lord,  
With bitter-sharp knife  
From the son of the king."  
With guile the great one  
Would they beguile,  
On the wailing thrall  
Laid they hand unwares,  
And cut the heart  
From out of Hjalli,  
Laid it bleeding on trencher  
And bare it to Gunnar.  
"Here have I the heart  
Of Hjalli the trembler,  
Little like the heart  
Of Hogni the hardy:  
As much as it trembleth  
Laid on the trencher  
By the half more it trembled  
In the breast of him hidden."  
Then laughed Hogni  
When they cut the heart from him,  
From the crest-smith yet quick,  
Little thought he to quail.  
The hard acorn of thought  
From the high king they took,  
Laid it bleeding on trencher  
And bare it Gunnar.  
"Here have I the heart  
Of Hogni the hardy,  
Little like to the heart  
Of Hjalli the trembler.  
Howso little it quaketh  
Laid here on the dish,  
Yet far less it quaked  
In the breast of him laid.  
"So far mayst thou bide  
From men's eyen, O Atli,  
As from that treasure  
Thou shalt abide!  
"Behold in my heart  
Is hidden for ever  
That hoard of the Niblungs,  
Now Hogni is dead.  
Doubt threw me two ways  
While the twain of us lived,  
But all that is gone  
Now I live on alone.  
"The great Rhine shall rule  
O'er the hate-raising treasure,  
That gold of the Niblungs,  
The seed of the gods:  
In the weltering water  
Shall that wealth lie a-gleaming,  
Or it shine on the hands  
Of the children of Huns!"  
Then cried Atli,  
King of the Hun-folk,  
"Drive forth your wains now  
The slave is fast bounden."  
And straightly thence  
The bit-shaking steeds  
Drew the hoard-warden,  
The war-god to his death.  
Atli the great king,  
Rode upon Glaum,  
With shields set round about,  
And sharp thorns of battle:  
Gudrun, bound by wedlock  
To these, victory made gods of,  
Held back her tears  
As the hall she ran into.  
"Let it fare with thee, Atli,  
E'en after thine oaths sworn  
To Gunnar fell often;  
Yea, oaths sworn of old time,  
By the sun sloping southward,  
By the high burg of Sigry,  
By the fair bed of rest,  
By the red ring of Ull!"  
Now a host of men  
Cast the high king alive  
Into a close  
Crept o'er within  
With most foul worms,  
Fulfilled of all venom,  
Ready grave to dig  
In his doughty heart.  
Wrathful-hearted he smote  
The harp with his hand,  
Gunnar laid there alone;  
And loud rang the strings.--  
In such wise ever  
Should hardy ring-scatterer  
Keep gold from all folk  
In the garth of his foeman.  
Then Atli would wend  
About his wide land,  
On his steed brazen shod,  
Back from the murder.  
Din there was in the garth,  
All thronged with the horses;  
High the weapon-song rose  
From men come from the heath.  
Out then went Gudrun,  
'Gainst Atli returning,  
With a cup gilded over,  
To greet the land's ruler;  
"Come, then, and take it,  
King glad in thine hall,  
From Gudrun's hands,  
For the hell-farers groan not!"  
Clashed the beakers of Atli,  
Wine-laden on bench,  
As in hall there a-gathered,  
The Huns fell a-talking,  
And the long-bearded eager ones  
Entered therein,  
From a murk den new-come,  
From the murder of Gunnar.  
Then hastened the sweet-faced  
Delight of the shield-folk,  
Bright in the fair hall,  
Wine to bear to them:  
The dreadful woman  
Gave dainties withal  
To the lords pale with fate,  
Laid strange word upon Atli:  
"The hearts of thy sons  
Hast thou eaten, sword-dealer,  
All bloody with death  
And drenched with honey:  
In most heavy mood  
Brood o'er venison of men!  
Drink rich draughts therewith,  
Down the high benches send it!  
"Never callest thou now  
From henceforth to thy knee  
Fair Erp or fair Eiril,  
Bright-faced with the drink;  
Never seest thou them now  
Amidmost the seat,  
Scattering the gold,  
Or shafting of spears;  
Manes trimming duly,  
Or driving steeds forth!"  
Din arose from the benches,  
Dread song of men was there,  
Noise 'mid the fair hangings,  
As all Hun's children wept;  
All saving Gudrun,  
Who never gat greeting,  
For her brethren bear-hardy  
For her sweet sons and bright,  
The young ones, the simple  
Once gotten with Atli.

The seed of gold  
Sowed the swan-bright woman,  
Rings of red gold  
She gave to the house-carls;  
Fate let she wax,  
Let the bright gold flow forth,  
In naught spared that woman  
The store-houses' wealth.  
Atli unaware  
Was a-weary with drink;  
No weapon had he,  
No heeding of Gudrun--  
Ah, the pity would be better,  
When in soft wise they twain  
Would full often embrace  
Before the great lords!  
To the bed with sword-point  
Blood gave she to drink  
With a hand fain of death,  
And she let the dogs loose:  
Then in from the hall-door--  
Up waked the house-carls--  
Hot brands she cast,  
Gat revenge for her brethren.  
To the flame gave she all  
Who therein might be found;  
Fell adown the old timbers,  
Reeked all treasure-houses;  
There the shield-mays were burnt,  
Their lives' span brought to naught;  
In the fierce fire sank down  
All the stead of the Budlungs.  
Wide told of is this--  
Ne'er sithence in the world,  
Thus fared bride clad in byrny  
For her brothers' avenging;  
For behold, this fair woman  
To three kings of the people,  
Hath brought very death  
Or ever she died!
