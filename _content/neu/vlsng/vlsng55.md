# THE LAMENT OF ODDRUN.

There was a king hight Heidrik, and his daughter was called Borgny, and
the name of her lover was Vilmund. Now she might nowise be made lighter
of a child she travailed with, before Oddrun, Atil's sister, came to
her,--she who had been the love of Gunnar, Giuki's son. But of their
speech together has this been sung:

I have hear tell  
In ancient tales  
How a may there came  
To Morna-land,  
Because no man  
On mould abiding  
For Heidrik's daughter  
Might win healing.  
All that heard Oddrun,  
Atil's sister,  
How that the damsel  
Had heavy sickness,  
So she led from stall  
Her bridled steed,  
And on the swart one  
Laid the saddle.  
She made her horse wend  
O'er smooth ways of earth,  
Until to a high-built  
Hall she came;  
Then the saddle she had  
From the hungry horse,  
And her ways wended  
In along the wide hall,  
And this word first  
Spake forth therewith:  
"What is most famed,  
Afield in Hunland,  
Or what may be  
Blithest in Hunland?"

QUOTH THE HANDMAID:

"Here lieth Borgny,  
Borne down by trouble,  
Thy sweet friend, O Oddrun,  
See to her helping!"

ODDRUN SAID:

"Who of the lords  
Hath laid this grief on her,  
Why is the anguish  
Of Borgny so weary?"

THE HANDMAID SAID:

"He is hight Vilmund,  
Friend of hawk-bearers,  
He wrapped the damsel  
In the warm bed-gear  
Five winters long  
Without her father's wotting."  
No more than this  
They spake methinks;  
Kind sat she down  
By the damsel's knee;  
Mightily sand Oddrun,  
Sharp piercing songs  
By Borgny's side:  
Till a maid and a boy  
Might tread on the world's ways,  
Blithe babes and sweet  
Of Hogni's bane:  
Then the damsel forewearied  
The word took up,  
The first word of all  
That had won from her:  
"So may help thee  
All helpful things,  
Fey and Freyia,  
And all the fair Gods,  
As thou hast thrust  
This torment from me!"

ODDRUN SAID:

"Yet no heart had I  
For thy helping,  
Since never wert thou  
Worthy of helping,  
But my word I held to,  
That of old was spoken  
When the high lords  
Dealt out the heritage,  
That every soul  
I would ever help."

BORGNY SAID:

"Right mad art thou, Oddrun,  
And reft of thy wits,  
Whereas thou speakest  
Hard words to me  
Thy fellow ever  
Upon the earth  
As of brothers twain,  
We had been born."

ODDRUN SAID:

"Well I mind me yet,  
What thou saidst that evening,  
Whenas I bore forth  
Fair drink for Gunnar;  
Such a thing, saidst thou,  
Should fall out never,  
For any may  
Save for me alone."  
Mind had the damsel  
Of the weary day  
Whenas the high lords  
Dealt out the heritage,  
And she sat her down,  
The sorrowful woman,  
To tell of the bale,  
And the heavy trouble.  
"Nourished was I  
In the hall of kings--  
Most folk were glad--  
'Mid the council of great ones:  
In fair life lived I,  
And the wealth of my father  
For five winters only,  
While yet he had life.  
"Such were the last words  
That ever he spake,  
The king forewearied,  
Ere his ways he went;  
For be bade folk give me  
The gold red-gleaming,  
And give me in Southlands  
To the son of Grimhild.  
"But Brynhild he bade  
To the helm to betake her,  
And said that Death-chooser  
She should become;  
And that no better  
Might ever be born  
Into the world,  
If fate would not spoil it.  
"Brynhild in bower  
Sewed at her broidery,  
Folk she had  
And fair lands about her;  
Earth lay a-sleeping,  
Slept the heavens aloft  
When Fafnir's-bane  
The burg first saw.  
"Then was war waged  
With the Welsh-wrought sword  
And the burg all broken  
That Brynhild owned;  
Nor wore long space,  
E'en as well might be,  
Ere all those wiles  
Full well she knew.  
"Hard and dreadful  
Was the vengeance she drew down,  
So that all we  
Have woe enow.  
Through all lands of the world  
Shall that story fare forth  
How she did her to death  
For the death of Sigurd.  
"But therewithal Gunnar  
The gold-scatterer  
Did I fall to loving  
And should have loved him.  
Rings of red gold  
Would they give to Atli,  
Would give to my brother  
Things goodly and great.  
"Yea, fifteen steads  
Would they give for me,  
And the load of Grani  
To have as a gift;  
But then spake Atli,  
That such was his will,  
Never gift to take  
From the sons of Giuki.  
"But we in nowise  
Might love withstand,  
And mine head must I lay  
On my love, the ring-breaker;  
And many there were  
Among my kin,  
Who said that they  
Had seen us together.  
"Then Atli said  
That I surely never  
Would fall to crime  
Or shameful folly:  
But now let no one  
For any other,  
That shame deny  
Where love has dealing.  
"For Atli sent  
His serving-folk  
Wide through the murkwood  
Proof to win of me,  
And thither they came  
Where they ne'er should have come,  
Where one bed we twain  
Had dight betwixt us.  
"To those men had we given  
Rings of red gold,  
Naught to tell  
Thereof to Atli,  
But straight they hastened  
Home to the house,  
And all the tale  
To Atli told.  
'Whereas from Gudrun  
Well they hid it,  
Though better by half  
Had she have known it.

"Din was there to hear  
Of the hoofs gold-shod,  
When into the garth  
Rode the sons of Giuki.  
"There from Hogni  
The heart they cut,  
But into the worm-close  
Cast the other.  
There the king, the wise-hearted,  
Swept his harp-strings,  
For the might king  
Had ever mind  
That I to his helping  
Soon should come.  
"But now was I gone  
Yet once again  
Unto Geirmund,  
Good feast to make;  
Yet had I hearing,  
E'en out from Hlesey,  
How of sore trouble  
The harp-strings sang.  
"So I bade the bondmaids  
Be ready swiftly,  
For I listed to save  
The life of the king,  
And we let our ship  
Swim over the sound,  
Till Atli's dwelling  
We saw all clearly.  
Then came the wretch \[1\]  
Crawling out,  
E'en Atli's mother,  
All sorrow upon her!  
A grave gat her sting  
In the heart of Gunnar,  
So that no helping  
Was left for my hero.  
"O gold-clad woman,  
Full oft I wonder  
How I my life  
Still hold thereafter,  
For methought I loved  
That light in battle,  
The swift with the sword,  
As my very self.  
"Thou hast sat and hearkened  
As I have told thee  
Of many an ill-fate,  
Mine and theirs--  
Each man liveth  
E'en as he may live--  
Now hath gone forth  
The greeting of Oddrun."

ENDNOTES:

\[1\] Atli's mother took the form of the only adder that was not lulled
to sleep by Gunnar's harp-playing, and who slew him.
