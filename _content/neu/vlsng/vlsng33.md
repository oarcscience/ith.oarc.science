# CHAPTER XXXI.

## Of the Lamentation of Gudrun over Sigurd's dead, as it is told told in ancient Songs. \[1\]

Gudrun of old days  
Drew near to dying  
As she sat in sorrow  
Over Sigurd;  
Yet she sighed not  
Nor smote hand on hand,  
Nor wailed she aught  
As other women.  
Then went earls to her.  
Full of all wisdom,  
Fain help to deal  
To her dreadful heart:  
Hushed was Gudrun  
Of wail, or greeting,  
But with a heavy woe  
Was her heart a-breaking.  
Bright and fair  
Sat the great earls' brides,  
Gold arrayed  
Before Gudrun;  
Each told the tale  
Of her great trouble,  
The bitterest bale  
She erst abode.

Then spake Giaflaug, Giuki's sister:

"Lo upon earth  
I live most loveless  
Who of five mates  
Must see the ending,  
Of daughters twain  
And three sisters,  
Of brethren eight,  
And abide behind lonely."  
Naught gat Gudrun  
Of wail and greeting,  
So heavy was she  
For her dead husband,  
So dreadful-hearted  
For the King laid dead there.

Then spake Herborg

Queen of Hunland--  
"Crueller tale  
Have I to tell of,  
Of my seven sons  
Down in the Southlands,  
And the eighth man, my mate,  
Felled in the death-mead.  
"Father and mother,  
And four brothers,  
On the wide sea  
The winds and death played with;  
The billows beat  
On the bulwark boards.  
"Alone must I sing o'er them,  
Alone must I array them,  
Alone must my hands deal with  
Their departing;  
And all this was  
In one season's wearing,  
And none was left  
For love or solace.  
"Then was I bound  
A prey of the battle,  
When that same season  
Wore to its ending;  
As a tiring may  
Must I bind the shoon  
Of the duke's high dame,  
Every day at dawning.  
"From her jealous hate  
Gat I heavy mocking,  
Cruel lashes  
She laid upon me,  
Never met I  
Better master  
Or mistress worser  
In all the wide world."  
Naught gat Gudrun  
Of wail or greeting,  
So heavy was she  
For her dead husband,  
So dreadful-hearted  
For the King laid dead there.

Then spake Gullrond,

Giuki's daughter--  
"O foster-mother,  
Wise as thou mayst be,  
Naught canst thou better  
The young wife's bale."  
And she bade uncover  
The dead King's corpse.  
She swept the sheet  
Away from Sigurd,  
And turned his cheek  
Towards his wife's knees--  
"Look on thy loved one  
Lay lips to his lips,  
E'en as thou wert clinging  
To thy king alive yet!"  
Once looked Gudrun--  
One look only,  
And saw her lord's locks  
Lying all bloody,  
The great man's eyes  
Glazed and deadly,  
And his heart's bulwark  
Broken by sword-edge.  
Back then sank Gudrun,  
Back on the bolster,  
Loosed was her head array,  
Red did her cheeks grow,  
And the rain-drops ran  
Down over her knees.

Then wept Gudrun,

Giuki's daughter,  
So that the tears flowed  
Through the pillow;  
As the geese withal  
That were in the homefield,  
The fair fowls the may owned,  
Fell a-screaming.

Then spake Gullrond,

Giuki's daughter--  
"Surely knew I  
No love like your love  
Among all men,  
On the mould abiding;  
Naught wouldst thou joy in  
Without or within doors,  
O my sister,  
Save beside Sigurd."

Then spake Gudrun,

Giuki's daughter--  
"Such was my Sigurd  
Among the sons of Giuki,  
As is the king leek  
O'er the low grass waxing,  
Or a bright stone  
Strung on band,  
Or a pearl of price  
On a prince's brow.  
"Once was I counted  
By the king's warriors  
Higher than any  
Of Herjan's mays;  
Now am I as little  
As the leaf may be,  
Amid wind-swept wood  
Now when dead he lieth.  
I miss from my seat,  
I miss from my bed,  
My darling of sweet speech.  
Wrought the sons of Giuki,  
Wrought the sons of Giuki,  
This sore sorrow,  
Yea, for their sister,  
Most sore sorrow.  
"So may your lands  
Lie waste on all sides,  
As ye have broken  
Your bounden oaths!  
Ne'er shalt thou, Gunnar,  
The gold have joy of;  
The dear-bought rings  
Shall drag thee to death,  
Whereon thou swarest  
Oath unto Sigurd.  
Ah, in the days by-gone  
Great mirth in the homefield  
When my Sigurd  
Set saddle on Grani,  
And they went their ways  
For the wooing of Brynhild!  
An ill day, an ill woman,  
And most ill hap!"

Then spake Brynhild,

Budli's daughter--  
"May the woman lack  
Both love and children,  
Who gained greeting  
For thee, O Gudrun!  
Who gave thee this morning  
Many words!"

Then spake Gullrond,

Giuki's daughter--  
"Hold peace of such words  
Thou hated of all folk!  
The bane of brave men  
Hast thou been ever,  
All waves of ill  
Wash over thy mind,  
To seven great kings  
Hast thou been a sore sorrow,  
And the death of good will  
To wives and women."

Then spake Brynhild,

Budli's daughter--  
"None but Atli  
Brought bale upon us,  
My very brother  
Born of Budli.  
When we saw in the hall  
Of the Hunnish people  
The gold a-gleaming  
On the kingly Giukings;  
I have paid for that faring  
Oft and Full,  
And for the sight  
That then I saw."  
By a pillar she stood  
And strained its wood to her;  
From the eyes of Brynhild,  
Budli's daughter,  
Flashed out fire,  
And she snorted forth venom,  
As the sore wounds she gazed on  
Of the dead-slain Sigurd.
