# FRAGMENTS OF THE LAY OF BRYNHILD

HOGNI SAID:

"What hath wrought Sigurd  
Of any wrong-doing  
That the life of the famed one  
Thou art fain of taking?"

GUNNAR SAID:

"To me has Sigurd  
Sworn many oaths,  
Sworn many oaths,  
And sworn them lying,  
And he bewrayed me  
When it behoved him  
Of all folk to his troth  
To be the most trusty."

HOGNI SAID:

"Thee hath Brynhild  
Unto all bale,  
And all hate whetted,  
And a work of sorrow;  
For she grudges to Gudrun  
All goodly life;  
And to thee the bliss  
Of her very body."

Some the wolf roasted,  
Some minced the worm,  
Some unto Guttorm  
Gave the wolf-meat,  
Or ever they might  
In their lust for murder  
On the high king  
Lay deadly hand.  
Sigurd lay slain  
On the south of the Rhine  
High from the fair tree  
Croaked forth the raven,  
"Ah, yet shall Atli  
On you redden edges,  
The old oaths shall weigh  
On your souls, O warriors."  
Without stood Gudrun,  
Giuki's daughter,  
And the first word she said  
Was even this word:  
"Where then is Sigurd,  
Lord of the Warfolk,  
Since my kin  
Come riding the foremost?  
One word Hogni Had for an answer:  
"Our swords have smitten  
Sigurd asunder,  
And the grey horse hangs drooping  
O'er his lord lying dead."  
Then quoth Brynhild,  
Budli's daughter;  
"Good weal shall ye have  
Of weapons and lands,  
That Sigurd alone  
Would surely have ruled  
If he had lived  
But a little longer.  
"Ah, nothing seemly  
For Sigurd to rule  
Giuki's house  
And the folk of the Goths,  
When of him five sons  
For the slaying of men,  
Eager for battle,  
Should have been begotten!"  
Then laughed Brynhild--  
Loud rang the whole house--  
One laugh only  
From out her heart:  
"Long shall your bliss be  
Of lands and people,  
Whereas the famed lord  
You have felled to the earth!"  
Then spake Gudrun,  
Giuki's daughter;  
"Much thou speakest,  
Many things fearful,  
All grame be on Gunnar  
The bane of Sigurd!  
From a heart full of hate  
Shall come heavy vengeance."  
Forth sped the even  
Enow there was drunken,  
Full enow was there  
Of all soft speech;  
And all men got sleep  
When to bed they were gotten;  
Gunnar only lay waking  
Long after all men.  
His feet fell he to moving,  
Fell to speak to himself  
The waster of men,  
Still turned in his mind  
What on the bough  
Those twain would be saying,  
The raven and erne,  
As they rode their ways homeward.  
But Brynhild awoke,  
Budli's daughter,  
May of the shield-folk,  
A little ere morning:  
"Thrust ye on, hold ye back,  
--Now all harm is wrought,--  
To tell of my sorrow,  
Or to let all slip by me?"  
All kept silence  
After her speaking,  
None might know  
That woman's mind,  
Or why she must weep  
To tell of the work  
That laughing once  
Of men she prayed.

BRYNHILD SPAKE:

"In dreams, O Gunnar,  
Grim things fell on me;  
Dead-cold the hall was,  
And my bed was a-cold,  
And thou, lord, wert riding  
Reft of all bliss,  
Laden with fetters  
'Mid the host of thy foemen."  
"So now all ye,  
O House of the Niblungs,  
Shall be brought to naught,  
O ye oath-breakers!  
"Think'st thou not, Gunnar,  
How that betid,  
When ye let the blood run  
Both in one footstep?  
With ill reward  
Hast thou rewarded  
His heart so fain  
To be the foremost!  
"As well was seen  
When he rode his ways,  
That king of all worth,  
Unto my wooing;  
How the host-destroyer  
Held to the vows  
Sworn beforetime,  
Sworn to the young king.  
"For his wounding-wand  
All wrought with gold,  
The king beloved  
Laid between us;  
Without were its edges  
Wrought with fire,  
But with venom-drops  
Deep dyed within."

Thus this song telleth of the death of Sigurd, and setteth forth how
that they slew him without doors; but some say that they slew him within
doors, sleeping in his bed. But the Dutch Folk say that they slew him
out in the wood: and so sayeth the ancient song of Gudrun, that Sigurd
and the sons of Giuki were riding to the Thing whenas he was slain. But
all with one accord say that they bewrayed him in their troth with him,
and fell on him as he lay unarrayed and unawares.
