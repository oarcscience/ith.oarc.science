# PART OF THE LAY OF SIGRDRIFA \[1\]

Now this is my first counsel,  
That thou with thy kin  
Be guiltless, guileless ever,  
Nor hasty of wrath,  
Despite of wrong done--  
Unto the dead good that doeth.  
Lo the second counsel,  
That oath thou swearest never,  
But trusty oath and true:  
Grim tormenting  
Gripes troth-breakers;  
Cursed wretch is the wolf of vows.  
This is my third rede,  
That thou at the Thing  
Deal not with the fools of folk;  
For unwise man  
From mouth lets fall  
Worser word than well he wotteth.  
Yet hard it is  
That holding of peace  
When men shall deem thee dastard,  
Or deem the lie said soothly;  
But woeful is home-witness,  
Unless right good thou gettest it.  
Ah, on another day  
Drive the life from out him,  
And pay the liar back for his lying.  
Now behold the fourth rede:  
If ill witch thee bideth,  
Woe-begatting by the way,  
Good going further  
Rather than guesting,  
Though thick night be on thee.  
Far-seeing eyes  
Need all sons of men  
Who wend in wrath to war;  
For baleful women  
Bide oft by the highway,  
Swords and hearts to soften.  
And now the fifth rede:  
As fair as thou seest  
Brides on the bench abiding,  
Let not love's silver  
Rule over thy sleeping;  
Draw no woman to kind kissing!  
For the sixth thing, I rede  
When men sit a-drinking  
Amid ale-words and ill-words,  
Dead thou naught  
With the drunken fight-staves  
For wine stealeth wit from many.  
Brawling and drink  
Have brought unto men  
Sorrow sore oft enow;  
Yea, bane unto some,  
And to some weary bale;  
Many are the griefs of mankind.  
For the seventh, I rede thee,  
If strife thou raisest  
With a man right high of heart,  
Better fight a-field  
Than burn in the fire  
Within thine hall fair to behold.  
The eighth rede that I give thee:  
Unto all ill look thou,  
And hold thine heart from all beguiling;  
Draw to thee no maiden,  
No man's wife bewray thou,  
Urge them not unto unmeet pleasure.  
This is the ninth counsel:  
That thou have heed of dead folk Whereso thou findest them a-field;  
Be they sick-dead,  
Be they sea-dead,  
Or come to ending by war-weapons.  
Let bath be made  
For such men fordone,  
Wash thou hands and feet thereof,  
Comb their hair and dry them  
Ere the coffin has them;  
Then bid them sleep full sweetly.  
This for the tenth counsel:  
That thou give trust never  
Unto oaths of foeman's kin,  
Be'st thou bane of his brother,  
Or hast thou felled his father;  
Wolf in young son waxes,  
Though he with gold be gladdened.  
For wrong and hatred  
Shall rest them never,  
Nay, nor sore sorrow.  
Both wit and weapons  
Well must the king have  
Who is fain to be the foremost.  
The last rede and eleventh:  
Until all ill look thou.  
And watch thy friends' ways ever  
Scarce durst I look  
For long life for thee, king:  
Strong trouble ariseth now already.
