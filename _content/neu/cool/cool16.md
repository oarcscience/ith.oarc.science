16\. The Violation of the Agreement

Then it was that Medb despatched six men at one and the same time to
attack Cuchulain, to wit: Traig ('Foot') and Dorn ('Fist') and Dernu
('Palm'), Col ('Sin') and Accuis ('Curse') and Erais√® ('Heresy'), three
druid-men and three druid-women. Cuchulain attacked them, so that they
fell at his hands.

Forasmuch as covenant and terms of single combat had been broken with
Cuchulain, Cuchulain took his sling in hand that day and began to shoot
at the host from Delga ('the Little Dart') in the south. Though numerous
were the men of Erin on that day, not one of them durst turn his face
southwards towards Cuchulain, whether dog, or horse, or man.
