It was nowise a heavy task for Finnchad to gather this assembly and
muster which Conchobar had enjoined upon him. For all there were of
Ulstermen to the east of Emain and to the west of Emain and to the north
of Emain set out at once for the field of Emain in the service of their
king, and at the word of their lord, and to await the recovery of
Conchobar. Such as were from the south of Emain waited not for
Conchobar, but set out directly on the trail of the host and on the
hoof-prints of the Táin.

The first stage the men of Ulster marched under Conchobar was from Emain
to the green in Iraird Cuillinn that night. "Why now delay we, ye men?"
Conchobar asked. "We await thy sons," they answered; "Fiacha and Fiachna
who have gone with a division from us to Tara to fetch Erc son of thy
daughter Fedlimid Nocruthach ('Nine-shaped'), son also of Carbre Niafer
king of Tara, to the end that he should come with the number of his
muster and his troops, his levy and his forces to our host at this
time." "By my word," exclaimed Conchobar; "I will delay here no longer
for them, lest the men of Erin hear of my rising from the weakness and
'Pains' wherein I was. For the men of Erin know not even if I am still
alive!"

Thereupon Conchobar and Celtchar proceeded with thirty hundred
spear-bristling chariot-fighters to Ath Irmidi ('the Ford of
Spear-points'). And there met them eight-score huge men of the
body-guard of Ailill and Medb, with eight-score women as their spoils.
Thus was their portion of the plunder of Ulster: A woman-captive in the
hand of each man of them. Conchobar and Celtchar struck off their
eight-score heads and released their eight-score captive-women. Ath
Irmidi ('the Ford of Spear-points') was the name of the place till that
time; Ath Fenè is its name ever since. It is for this it is called Ath
Fenè, because the warriors of the Fenè from the east and the warriors of
the Fenè from the west encountered one another in battle and contest man
for man on the brink of the ford.

Conchobar and Celtchar returned that night to the green in Iraird
Cuillinn hard by the men of Ulster. Thereupon Celtchar aroused the men
of Ulster.
