6\. The March Of The Host

On the first stage the hosts went from Cruachan, they slept the night at
Cul Silinne, where to-day is Cargin's Lough. And in that place was fixed
the tent of Ailill son of Ross, and the trappings were arranged, both
bedding and bed-clothes. The tent of Fergus macRoig was on his right
hand; Cormac Conlongas, Conchobar's son, was beside him; Ith macEtgaith
next to that; Fiachu macFiraba, the son of Conchobar's daughter, at its
side; Conall Cernach at its side, Gobnenn macLurnig at the side of that.
The place of Ailill's tent was on the right on the march, and thirty
hundred men of Ulster beside him. And the thirty hundred men of Ulster
on his right hand had he to the end that the whispered talk and
conversation and the choice supplies of food and of drink might be the
nearer to them.

Medb of Cruachan, daughter of Eocho Fedlech, moreover, was at Ailill's
left. Finnabair ('Fairbrow'), daughter of Ailill and Medb, at her side,
besides servants and henchmen. Next, Flidais Foltchain ('of the Lovely
Hair'), wife first of Ailill Finn ('the Fair'). She took part in the
Cow-spoil of Cualnge after she had slept with Fergus; and she it was
that every seventh night brought sustenance in milk to the men of Erin
on the march, for king and queen and prince and poet and pupil.

Medb remained in the rear of the host that day in quest of tidings and
augury and knowledge. She called to her charioteer to get ready her nine
chariots for her, to make a circuit of the camp that she might learn who
was loath and who eager to take part in the hosting. With nine chariots
she was wont to travel, that the dust of the great host might not soil
her. Medb suffered not her chariot to be let down nor her horses unyoked
until she had made a circuit of the camp.

Then, when she had reviewed the host, were Medb's horses unyoked and her
chariots let down, and she took her place beside Ailill macMata. And
Ailill asked tidings of Medb: who was eager and who was loath for the
warfare. "Futile for all is the emprise but for one troop only, namely
the division of the Galian ('of Leinster')," quoth Medb. "Why blamest
thou these men?" queried Ailill. "It is not that we blame them," Medb
made answer. "What good service then have these done that they are
praised above all?" asked Ailill. "There is reason to praise them," said
Medb. "Splendid are the warriors. When the others begin making their
pens and pitching their camp, these have finished building their bothies
and huts. When the rest are building their bothies and huts, these have
finished preparing their food and drink. When the rest are preparing
their food and drink, these have finished eating and feasting, and their
harps are playing for them. When all the others have finished eating and
feasting, these are by that time asleep.

And even as their servants and thralls are distinguished above the
servants and thralls of the men of Erin, so shall their heroes and
champions be distinguished beyond the heroes and champions of the men of
Erin this time on this hosting. It is folly then for these to go, since
it is those others will enjoy the victory of the host!'' "So much the
better, I bow," replied Ailill; "for it is with us they go and it is for
us they fight." "They shall not go with us nor shall they fight for us,"
cried Medb. Let them stay at home then," said Ailill. "Stay they shall
not," answered Medb. "They will fall on us in the rear and will seize
our land against us." "What shall they do then," Finnabair asked, "if
they go not out nor yet remain at home?" "Death and destruction and
slaughter is what I desire for them," answered Medb. "For shame then on
thy speech," spake Ailill; "'tis a woman's advice, for that they pitch
their tents and make their pens so promptly and unwearily."

"By the truth of my conscience," cried Fergus, "not thus shall it
happen, for they are allies of us men of Ulster. No one shall do them to
death but he that does death to myself along with them!" "Not to me
oughtest thou thus to speak, O Fergus," then cried Medb, "for I have
hosts enough to slay and slaughter thee with the division of Leinstermen
round thee. For there are the seven Mane, that is, my seven sons with
their seven divisions, and the sons of Maga with their seven divisions,
and Ailill with his division, and I myself with my own body-guard
besides. We are strong enough here to kill and slaughter thee with thy
cantred of the Leinstermen round thee!"

"It befits thee not thus to speak to me," said Fergus, "for I have with
me here in alliance with us Ulstermen, the seven Under-kings of Munster,
with their seven cantreds. Here we have what is best of the youths of
Ulster, even the division of the Black Banishment. Here we have what is
best of the noble youths of Ulster, even the division of the Galian ('of
Leinster'). Furthermore, I myself am bond and surety and guarantee for
them, since ever they left their own native land. I will give thee
battle in the midst of the camp, and to me will they hold steadfast on
the day of battle.

More than all that," added Fergus, "these men shall be no subject of
dispute. By that I mean I will never forsake them. For the rest, we will
care for these warriors, to the end that they get not the upper hand of
the host. "The number of our force is seventeen cantreds, besides our
rabble and our women-folk-- for with each king was his queen in Medb's
company-- and our striplings; the eighteenth division is namely the
cantred of the Galian. This division of Leinstermen I will distribute
among all the host of the men of Erin in such wise that no five men of
them shall be in any one place." "That pleaseth me well," said Medb:
"let them be as they may, if only they be not in the battle-order of the
ranks where they now are in such great force." Forthwith Fergus
distributed the cantred of the Galian among the men of Erin in such wise
that there were not five men of them in any one place.

Thereupon, the troops set out on their way and march. It was no easy
thing for their kings and their leaders to attend to that mighty host.
They took part in the expedition according to the several tribes and
according to the several stems and the several districts wherewith they
had come, to the end that they might see one other and know one other,
that each man might be with his comrades and with his friends and with
his kinsfolk on the march. They declared that in such wise they should
go.

They also took counsel in what manner they should proceed on their
hosting. Thus they declared they should proceed: Each host with its
king, each troop with its lord, and each band with its captain; each
king and each prince of the men of Erin by a separate route on his
halting height apart. They took counsel who was most proper to seek
tidings in advance of the host between the two provinces. And they said
it was Fergus, inasmuch as the expedition was an obligatory one with
him, for it was he that had been seven years in the kingship of Ulster.
And after Conchobar had usurped the kingship and after the murder of the
sons of Usnech who were under his protection and surety, Fergus left the
Ultonians, and for seventeen years he was away from Ulster in exile and
in enmity. For that reason it was fitting that he above all should go
after tidings.

So the lead of the way was entrusted to Fergus. Fergus before all fared
forth to seek tidings, and a feeling of love and affection for his
kindred of the men of Ulster came over him, and he led the troops astray
in a great circuit to the north and the south. And he despatched
messengers with warnings to the Ulstermen. And he began to detain and
delay the host.

Medb perceived this and she upbraided him for it, and chanted the lay:--

> Medb: "Fergus, speak, what shall we say?  
> What may mean this devious way?  
> For we wander north and south;  
> Over other lands we stray!"

> Fergus: "Medb, why art thou so perturbed?  
> There's no treacherous purpose here.  
> Ulster's land it is, O queen,  
> Over which I've led thy host!"

> Medb: "Ailill, splendid with his hosts,  
> Fears thee lest thou should'st betray.  
> Thou hast not bent all thy mind  
> To direct us on our way!"

> Fergus: "Not to bring the host to harm  
> Make these changing circuits I.  
> Haply could I now avoid  
> Sualtach's son, the Blacksmith's Hound!"

> Medb: "Ill of thee to wrong our host,  
> Fergus, son of Ross the Red;  
> Much good hast thou found with us,  
> Fergus, in thy banishment!"

"I will be in the van of the troops no longer," cried Fergus; "but do
thou find another to go before them." For all that, Fergus kept his
place in the van of the troops.

The four mighty provinces of Erin passed that night on Cul Silinne. The
sharp, keen-edged anxiety for Cuchulain came upon Fergus and he warned
the men of Erin to be on their guard, because there would come upon them
the rapacious lion, and the doom of foes, the vanquisher of multitudes,
and the chief of retainers, the mangler of great hosts, the hand that
dispenseth treasures, and the flaming torch, even Cuchulain son of
Sualtaim. And thus he foreshowed him and chanted a lay, and Medb
responded :

> Fergus: "Well for ye to heed and watch,  
> With array of arms and men.  
> He will come, the one we fear,  
> Murthemne's great, deedful youth!"

> Medb: "How so dear, this battle-rede,  
> Comes from thee, Roig's son most bold.  
> Men and arms have I enough  
> To attend Cuchulain here!"

> Fergus: "Thou shalt need them, Medb of Ai,  
> Men and arms for battle hard,  
> With the grey steed's horseman brave,  
> All the night and all the day!"

> Medb: "I have kept here in reserve  
> Heroes fit for fight and spoil;  
> Thirty hundred hostage-chiefs,  
> Leinster's bravest champions they.

> Fighting men from Cruachan fair,  
> Braves from clear-streamed Luachair,  
> Four full realms of goodly Gaels  
> Will defend me from this man!"

> Fergus: "Rich in troops from Mourne and Bann,  
> Blood he'll draw o'er shafts of spears;  
> He will cast to mire and sand  
> These three thousand Leinstermen.

> With the swallow's swiftest speed,  
> With the rush of biting wind,  
> So bounds on my dear brave Hound,  
> Breathing slaughter on his foes!"

> Medb: "Fergus, should he come 'tween us,  
> To Cuchulain bear this word:  
> He were prudent to stay still;  
> Cruachan holds a check in store."

> Fergus: "Valiant will the slaughter be  
> Badb's wild daughter gloats upon.  
> For the Blacksmith's Hound will spill  
> Showers of blood on hosts of men!"

After this lay the men of the four grand provinces of Erin marched on
the morrow over Moin Coltna ('the Marsh of Coltain') eastwards that day;
and there met them eight score deer in a single herd. The troops spread
out and surrounded and killed them so that none of them escaped. But
there is one event to add: Although the division of the Galian had been
dispersed among the men of Erin, wherever there was a man of the Galian,
it was he that got them, except five deer only which was the men of
Erin's share thereof, so that one division took all the eight score
deer.

It was on that same day, after the coming of the warning from Fergus to
the Ulstermen, that Cuchulain son of Sualtaim, and Sualtaim Sidech ('of
the Fairy Mound'), his father, when they had received the warning from
Fergus, came so near on their watch for the host that their horses
grazed in pasture round the pillarstone on Ard Cuillenn ('the Height of
Cuillenn'). Sualtaim's horses cropped the grass north of the pillarstone
close to the ground; Cuchulain's cropped the grass south of the
pillar-stone even to the ground and the bare stones.

"Well, O master Sualtaim," said Cuchulain; "the thought of the host is
fixed sharp upon me to-night, so do thou depart for us with warnings to
the men of Ulster, that they remain not in the smooth plains but that
they betake themselves to the woods and wastes and steep glens of the
province, if so they may keep out of the way of the men of Erin." "And
thou, lad, what wilt thou do?" "I must go southwards to Temair to keep
tryst with the maid of Fedlimid Nocruthach ('of the Nine Forms')
Conchobar's daughter, according to my own agreement, till morning."
"Alas, that one should go on such a journey," said Sualtaim, "and leave
the Ulstermen under the feet of their foes and their enemies for the
sake of a tryst with a woman!" "For all that, I needs must go. For, an I
go not, the troth of men will be held for false and the promises of
women held for true."

Sualtaim departed with warnings to the men of Ulster. Cuchulain strode
into the wood, and there, with a single blow, he lopped the prime
sapling of an oak, root and top, and with only one foot and one hand and
one eye he exerted himself; and he made a twig-ring thereof and set an
ogam script on the plug of the ring, and set the ring round the narrow
part of the pillar-stone on Ard ('the Height') of Cuillenn. He forced
the ring till it reached the thick of the pillar-stone. Thereafter
Cuchulain went his way to his tryst with the woman.

Touching the men of Erin, the account follows here: They came up to the
pillar-stone at Ard Cuillenn, which is called Crossa Coil to-day, and
they began looking out upon the province that was unknown to them, the
province of Ulster. And two of Medb's people went always before them in
the van of the host, at every camp and on every march, at every ford and
every river and every gap. They were wont to do so that they might save
the brooches and cushions and cloaks of the host, so that the dust of
the multitude might not soil them and that no stain might come on the
princes' raiment in the crowd or the crush of the hosts or the throng:
these were the two sons of Nera, who was the son of Nuathar, son of
Tacan, two sons of the house-stewards of Cruachan, Err and Innell, to
wit. Fraech and Fochnam were the names of their charioteers.

The nobles of Erin arrived at the pillar-stone and they there beheld the
signs of the browsing of the horses, cropping around the pillar, and
they looked close at the rude hoop which the royal hero had left behind
about the pillar-stone. And Ailill took the withy in his hand and placed
it in Fergus' hand, and Fergus read the ogam script graven on the plug
of the withy, and made known to the men of Erin what was the meaning of
the ogam writing that was on it.

When Medb came, she asked, "Why wait ye here?" "Because of yonder withy
we wait," Fergus made answer; "there is an ogam writing on its binding
and this is what it saith: ' Let no one go past here till a man be found
to throw a withy like unto this, using only one hand and made of a
single branch, and I except my master Fergus.' Truly," Fergus added, "it
was Cuchulain threw it, and it was his steeds that grazed this plain."
And he placed the hoop in the hands of the druids, and it is thus he
began to recite and he pronounced a lay:--

> "What bespeaks this withe to us,  
> What purports its secret rede?  
> And what number cast it here,  
> Was it one man or a host?

> "If ye go past here this night,  
> And bide not a one night in camp  
> On ye'll come the tear-flesh Hound;  
> Yours the blame, if ye it scorn!

> "'Evil on the host he'll bring,  
> If ye go your way past this.  
> Find, ye druids, find out here,  
> For what cause this withe was made!"

> A druid speaks: "Cut by hero, cast by chief,  
> As a perfect trap for foes.  
> Stayer of lords--with hosts of men--  
> One man cast it with one hand!

> "With fierce rage the battle 'gins  
> Of the Smith's Hound of Red Branch.  
> Bound to meet this madman's rage;  
> This the name that's on the withe!

> "Woes to bring with hundred fights  
> On four realms of Erin's land;  
> Naught I know 'less it be this  
> For what cause the withe was made!"

After that lay: "I pledge you my word," said Fergus, "if so ye set at
naught yon withy and the royal hero that made it, and if ye go beyond
without passing a night's camp and quarterage here, or until a man of
you make a withy of like kind, using but one foot and one eye and one
hand, even as he made it, certain it is, whether ye be under the ground
or in a tight-shut house, the man that wrote the ogam hereon will bring
slaughter and bloodshed upon ye before the hour of rising on the morrow,
if ye make light of him!"

"That, surely, would not be pleasing to us," quoth Medb, "that any one
should straightway spill our blood or besmirch us red, now that we are
come to this unknown province, even to the province of Ulster. More
pleasing would it be to us, to spill another's blood and redden him."
"Far be it from us to set this withy at naught," said Ailill, "nor shall
we make little of the royal hero that wrought it, rather will we resort
to the shelter of this great wood, that is, Fidduin, ('the Wood of the
Dun') southwards till morning. There will we pitch our camp and
quarters."

Thereupon the hosts advanced, and as they went they felled the wood with
their swords before their chariots, so that Slechta ('the Hewn Road') is
still the by-name of that place where is Partraige Beca ('the Lesser
Partry') south-west of Cenannas na Rig ('Kells of the Kings') near Cul
Sibrille.

According to other books, it is told as follows: After they had come to
Fidduin they saw a chariot and therein a beautiful maiden. It is there
that the conversation between Medb and Fedelm the seeress took place
that we spoke of before, and it is after the answer she made to Medb
that the wood was cut down: "Look for me," said Medb, "how my journey
will be." "It is hard for me," the maiden made answer, "for no glance of
eye can I cast upon them in the wood." "Then it is plough-land this
shall be," quoth Medb; "we will cut down the wood." Now, this was done,
so that this is the name of the place, Slechta, to wit. They slept in
Cul Sibrille, which is Cenannas.

A heavy snow fell on them that night, and so great it was that it
reached to the shoulders of the men and to the flanks of the horses and
to the poles of the chariots, so that all the provinces of Erin were one
level plane from the snow. But no huts nor bothies nor tents did they
set up that night, nor did they prepare food nor drink, nor made they a
meal nor repast. None of the men of Erin wot whether friend or foe was
next him until the bright hour of sunrise on the morrow.

Certain it is that the men of Erin experienced not a night of encampment
or of station that held more discomfort or hardship for them than that
night with the snow at Cul Sibrille. The four grand provinces of Erin
moved out early on the morrow with the rising of the bright-shining sun
glistening on the snow and marched on from that part into another.

Now, as regards Cuchulain: It was far from being early when he arose
from his tryst. And then he ate a meal and took a repast, and he
remained until he had washed himself and bathed on that day. He called
to his charioteer to lead out the horses and yoke the chariot. The
charioteer led out the horses and yoked the chariot, and Cuchulain
mounted his chariot. And they came on the track of the army. They found
the trail of the men of Erin leading past them from that part into
another.

"Alas, O master Laeg," cried Cuchulain, "by no good luck went we to our
tryst with the woman last night. Would that we had not gone thither nor
betrayed the Ultonians. This is the least that might be looked for from
him that keeps guard on the marches, a cry, or a shout, or an alarm, or
to call, 'Who goes the road?' This it fell not unto us to say. The men
of Erin have gone past us, without warning, without complaint, into the
land of Ulster." "I foretold thee that, O Cuchulain," said Laeg. "Even
though thou wentest to thy woman-tryst last night, such a disgrace would
come upon thee." "Good now, O Laeg, go thou for us on the trail of the
host and make an estimate of them, and discover for us in what number
the men of Erin went by us."

Laeg came on the track of the host, and he went to the front of the
trail and he came on its sides and he went to the back of it. "Thou art
confused in thy counting, O Laeg, my master," quoth Cuchulain. "Confused
I must be," Laeg replied. "Come into the chariot then, and I will make a
reckoning of them." The charioteer mounted the chariot and Cuchulain
went on the trail of the hosts and after a long while he made a
reckoning of them. "Even thou, it is not easy for thee. Thou art
perplexed in thy counting, my little Cuchulain," quoth Laeg. "Not
perplexed," answered Cuchulain; "it is easier for me than for thee. For
I know the number wherewith the hosts went past us, namely, eighteen
cantreds. Nay more: the eighteenth cantred has been distributed among
the entire host of the men of Erin.

Now, many and divers were the magic virtues that were in Cuchulain that
were in no one else in his day. Excellence of form, excellence of shape,
excellence of build, excellence in swimming, excellence in horsemanship,
excellence in chess and in draughts, excellence in battle, excellence in
contest, excellence in single combat, excellence in reckoning,
excellence in speech, excellence in counsel, excellence in bearing,
excellence in laying waste and in plundering from the neighbouring
border.

"Good, my friend Laeg. Brace the horses for us to the chariot; lay on
the goad for us on the horses; drive on the chariot for us and give thy
left board to the hosts, to see can we overtake the van or the rear or
the midst of the hosts, for I will cease to live unless there fall by my
hand this night a friend or foe of the men of Erin."

Then it was that the charioteer gave the prick to the steeds. He turned
his left board to the hosts till he arrived at Turloch Caille More ('the
Creek of the Great Wood') northwards of Cnogba na Rig ('Knowth of the
Kings') which is called Ath Gabla ('the Ford of the Fork'). Thereupon
Cuchulain went round the host till he came to Ath Grenca. He went into
the wood at that place and sprang out of his chariot, and he lopped off
a four-pronged fork, root and top, with a single stroke of his sword. He
pointed and charred it and put a writing in ogam on its side, and he
gave it a long throw from the hinder part of his chariot with the tip of
a single hand, in such wise that two-thirds of it sank into the ground
and only one-third was above it in the mid part of the stream, so that
no chariot could go thereby on this side or that.

Then it was that the same two striplings surprised him, namely, the two
sons of Nera son of Nuathar son of Tacan, while engaged in that feat.
And they vied which of the twain would be the first to fight and contend
with Cuchulain, which of them would inflict the first wound upon him and
be the first to behead him. Cuchulain turned on them, and straightway he
struck off their four heads from themselves Eirr and Indell and from
Foich and Fochlam, their drivers, and he fixed a head of each man of
them on each of the prongs of the pole.

And Cuchulain let the horses of the party go back in the direction of
the men of Erin, to return by the same road, their reins loose around
their ears and their bellies red and the bodies of the warriors dripping
their blood down outside on the ribs of the chariots. Thus he did, for
he deemed it no honour nor deemed he it fair to take horses or garments
or arms from corpses or from the dead. And then the troops saw the
horses of the party that had gone out in advance before them, and the
headless bodies of the warriors oozing their blood down on the ribs of
the chariots (and their crimsoned trappings upon them). The van of the
army waited for the rear to come up, and all were thrown into confusion
of striking, that is as much as to say, into a tumult of arms.

Medb and Fergus and the Manè and the sons of Maga drew near. For in this
wise was Medb wont to travel, and nine chariots with her alone; two of
these chariots before her, and two chariots behind, and two chariots at
either side, and her own chariot in the middle between them. This is why
Medb did so, that the turves from the horses' hoofs, or the flakes of
foam from the bridle-bits, or the dust of the mighty host or of the
numerous throng might not reach the queen's diadem of gold which she
wore round her head.

"What have we here?" queried Medb. "Not hard to say," each and all made
answer; "the horses of the band that went out before us are here and
their bodies lacking their heads in their chariots." They held a council
and they felt certain it was the sign of a multitude and of the approach
of a mighty host, and that it was the Ulstermen that had come and that
it was a battle that had taken place before them on the ford. And this
was the counsel they took to despatch Cormac Conlongas, Conchobar's son,
from them to learn what was at the ford; because, even though the
Ulstermen might be there, they would not kill the son of their own king.

Thereupon Cormac Conlongas, Conchobar's son, set forth and this was the
complement with which he went, ten hundred in addition to twenty hundred
armed men, to ascertain what was at the ford. And when he was come, he
saw naught save the fork in the middle of the ford, with four heads upon
it dripping their blood down along the stem of the fork into the stream
of the river, and a writing in ogam on the side, and the signs of the
two horses and the track of a single chariot-driver and the marks of a
single warrior leading out of the ford going therefrom to the eastward.
By that time, the nobles of Erin had drawn nigh to the ford and they all
began to look closely at the fork. They marvelled and wondered who had
set up the trophy.

One of their men deciphered the ogam-writing that was on the side of the
fork, to wit: 'A single man cast this fork with but a single hand; and
go ye not past it till one man of you throw it with one hand, excepting
Fergus.'

"What name have ye men of Ulster for this ford till now, Fergus?" asked
Ailill. "Ath Grenca," answered Fergus; "and Ath Gabla ('Ford of the
Fork') shall now be its name forever from this fork," said Fergus. And
he recited the lay:--

> "Grenca's ford shall change its name,  
> From the strong and fierce Hound's deed.  
> Here we see a four-pronged fork,  
> Set to prove all Erin's men!

> "On two points-- as sign of war--  
> Are Fraech's head and Fochnam's head;  
> On its other points are thrust  
> Err's head and Innell's withal!

> "And yon ogam on its side,  
> Find, ye druids, in due form,  
> Who has set it upright there?  
> What host drove it in the ground?"

> (A druid:) "Yon forked pole-- with fearful strength--  
> Which thou seest, Fergus, there,  
> One man cut, to welcome us,  
> With one perfect stroke of sword!

> "Pointed it and shouldered it--  
> Though this was no light exploit--  
> After that he flung it down,  
> To uproot for one of you!

> "Grenca was its name till now--  
> All will keep its memory--  
> Fork-ford be its name for aye,  
> From the fork that's in the ford!"

After the lay, spake Ailill: "I marvel and wonder, O Fergus, who could
have sharpened the fork and slain with such speed the four that had gone
out before us." "Fitter it were to marvel and wonder at him who with a
single stroke lopped the fork which thou seest, root and top, pointed
and charred it and flung it the length of a throw from the hinder part
of his chariot, from the tip of a single hand, so that it sank over
two-thirds into the ground and that naught save one-third is above; nor
was a hole first dug with his sword, but through a grey stone's flag it
was thrust, and thus it is geis for the men of Erin to proceed to the
bed of this ford till one of ye pull out the fork with the tip of one
hand, even as he erewhile drove it down."

"Thou art of our hosts, O Fergus," said Medb; "avert this necessity from
us, and do thou draw the fork for us from the bed of the ford." "Let a
chariot be brought me," cried Fergus, "till I draw it out, that it may
be seen that its butt is of one hewing." And a chariot was brought to
Fergus, and Fergus laid hold with a truly mighty grip on the fork, and
he made splinters and scraps of the chariot. "Let another chariot be
brought me," cried Fergus. Another chariot was brought to Fergus, and
Fergus made a tug at the fork and again made fragments and splinters of
the chariot, both its box and its yoke and its wheels. "Again let a
chariot be brought me," cried Fergus. And Fergus exerted his strength on
the fork, and made pieces and bits of the chariot.

There where the seventeen chariots of the Connachtmen's chariots were,
Fergus made pieces and bits of them all, and yet he failed to draw the
fork from the bed of the ford. "Come now, let it be, O Fergus," cried
Medb; "break our people's chariots no more. For hadst thou not been now
engaged on this hosting, by this time should we have come to Ulster,
driving divers spoils and cattleherds with us. We wot wherefore thou
workest all this, to delay and detain the host till the Ulstermen rise
from their 'Pains' and offer us battle, the battle of the Táin."

"Bring me a swift chariot," cried Fergus. And his own chariot was
brought to Fergus, and Fergus gave a tug at the fork, and nor wheel nor
floor nor one of the chariot-poles creaked nor cracked. Even though it
was with his strength and prowess that the one had driven it down, with
his might and doughtiness the other drew it out,-- the battle-champion,
the gap-breaker of hundreds, the crushing sledge, the stone-of-battle
for enemies, the head of retainers, the foe of hosts, the hacking of
masses, the flaming torch and the leader of mighty combat.

He drew it up with the tip of one hand till it reached the slope of his
shoulder, and he placed the fork in Ailill's hand. Ailill scanned it; he
regarded it near. "The fork, meseems, is all the more perfect," quoth
Ailill; "for a single stroke I see on it from butt to top." "Aye, all
the more perfect," Fergus replied. And Fergus began to sing praise of
Cuchulain, and he made a lay thereon:--

> "Here behold the famous fork,  
> By which cruel Cuchulain stood.  
> Here he left, for hurt to all,  
> Four heads of his border-foes!

> "Surely he'd not flee therefrom,  
> 'Fore aught man, how brave or bold.  
> Though the scatheless Hound this left,  
> On its hard rind there is gore!

> "To its hurt the host goes east,  
> Seeking Cualnge's wild Brown bull.  
> Warriors' cleaving there shall be,  
> 'Neath Cuchulain's baneful sword!

> "No gain will their stout bull be,  
> For which sharp-armed war will rage;  
> At the fall of each head's skull  
> Erin's every tribe shall weep!

> "I have nothing to relate  
> As regards Dechtirè's son.  
> Men and women hear the tale  
> Of this fork, how it came here!"

After this lay: "Let us pitch our booths and tents," said Ailill, "and
let us make ready food and drink, and let us sing songs and strike up
harps, and let us eat and regale ourselves, for, of a truth, never
before nor since knew the men of Erin a night of encampment or of
entrenchment that held sorer discomfort or distress for them than
yesternight. Let us give heed to the manner of folk to whom we go and
let us hear somewhat of their deeds and famous tales." They raised their
booths and pitched their tents. They got ready their food and drink, and
songs were sung and harping intoned by them, and feasting and eating
indulged in.

And Ailill inquired of Fergus: "I marvel and wonder who could have come
to us to our lands and slain so quickly the four that had gone out
before us. Is it likely that Conchobar son of Fachtna Fatach ('the
Mighty'), High King of Ulster, has come to us?" "It is never likely that
he has," Fergus answered; "for a shame it would be to speak ill of him
in his absence. There is nothing he would not stake for the sake of his
honour. For if he had come hither to the border of the land, there would
have come armies and troops and the pick of the men of Erin that are
with him. And even though against him in one and the same place, and in
one mass and one march and one camp, and on one and the same hill were
the men of Erin and Alba, Britons and Saxons, he would give them battle,
before him they would break and it is not he that would be routed."

"A question, then: Who would be like to have come to us? Is it like that
Cuscraid Mend ('the Stammerer') of Macha would have come, Conchobar's
son, from Inis Cuscraid?" "Nay then, it is not; he, the son of the High
King," Fergus answered. "There is nothing he would not hazard for the
sake of his honour. For were it he that had come hither, there would
have come the sons of kings and the royal leaders of Ulster and Erin
that are serving as hirelings with him. And though there might be
against him in one and the same place, in one mass and one march and one
camp, and on one and the same hill the men of Erin and Alba, Britons and
Saxons, he would give them battle, before him they would break and it is
not he that would be routed."

"I ask, then, whether Eogan son of Durthacht, King of Fernmag, would
have come?" "In sooth, it is not likely. For, had he come hither, the
pick of the men of Fernmag would have come with him, battle he would
give them, before him they would break, and it is not he that would be
routed."

"I ask, then: Who would be likely to have come to us? Is it likely that
he would have come, Celtchai son of Uthechar?" "No more is it likely
that it was he. A shame it would be to make light of him in his absence,
him the battle-stone for the foes of the province, the head of all the
retainers and the gate-of-battle of Ulster. And even should there be
against him in one place and one mass and one march and one camp, and on
one and the same hill all the men of Erin from the west to the east,
from the south to the north, battle he would give them, before him they
would break and it is not he that would be routed."

"I ask, then: Who would be like to have come to us?" asked Ailill. "I
know not," Fergus replied, "unless it be the little lad, my nursling and
Conchobar's. Cuchulain ('the Wolf-dog of Culann the Smith') he is
called.

He is the one who could have done the deed," answered Fergus. "He it is
who could have lopped the tree with one blow from its root, could have
killed the four with the quickness wherewith they were killed and could
have come to the border with his charioteer."

"Of a truth," spake Ailill, "I heard from ye of this little boy once on
a time in Cruachan. What might be the age of this little boy now?" "It
is by no means his age that is most formidable in him," answered Fergus.
"Because, manful were his deeds, those of that lad, at a time when he
was younger than he now is.

In his fifth year he went in quest of warlike deeds among the lads of
Emain Macha. In his sixth a year he went to learn skill in arms and
feats with Scathac, and he went to woo Emer; in his seventh year he took
arms; in his seventeenth year he is at this time."

"How so!" exclaimed Medb. "Is there even now amongst the Ulstermen one
his equal in age that is more redoubtable than he?" "We have not found
there a man-at-arms that is harder, nor a point that is keener, more
terrible nor quicker, nor a more bloodthirsty wolf, nor a raven more
flesh-loving, nor a wilder warrior, nor a match of his age that would
reach to a third or a fourth the likes of Cuchulain. Thou findest not
there," Fergus went on, "a hero his peer, nor a lion that is fiercer,
nor a plank of battle, nor a sledge of destruction, nor a gate of
combat, nor a doom of hosts, nor a contest of valour that would be of
more worth than Cuchulain.

Thou findest not there one that could equal his age and his growth, his
dress and his terror, his size and his splendour, his fame and his
voice, his shape and his power, his form and his speech, his strength
and his feats and his valour, his smiting, his heat and his anger, his
dash, his assault and attack, his dealing of doom and affliction, his
roar, his speed, his fury, his rage, and his quick triumph with the feat
of nine men on each sword's point above him, like unto Cuchulain."

"We make not much import of him," quoth Medb. "It is but a single body
he has; he shuns being wounded; he avoids being taken. They do say his
age is but that of a girl to be wed. His deeds of manhood have not yet
come, nor will he hold out against tried men, this young, beardless
elf-man of whom thou spokest." "We say not so," replied Fergus, "for
manful were the deeds of the lad at a time when he was younger than he
now is."
