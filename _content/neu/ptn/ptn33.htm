<p>One day the Bear met the Fox, who came slinking along with a string of fish he had stolen.</p>  
<p>"Whence did you get those from?" asked the Bear.</p>  
<p>"Oh! my Lord Bruin, I've been out fishing and caught them," said the Fox.</p>  
<p>So the Bear had a mind to learn to fish too, and bade the Fox tell him how he was to set about it.</p>  
<p>"Oh! it's an easy craft for you," answered the Fox, "and soon learnt. You've only got to go upon the ice, and cut a hole and stick your tail down into it; and so you must go on holding it there as long as you can. You're not to mind if your tail smarts a little; that's when the fish bite. The longer you hold it there the more fish you'll get; and then all at once out with it, with a cross pull sideways, and with a strong pull too."</p>  
<p>Yes; the Bear did as the Fox had said, and held his tail a long, long time down in the hole, till it was fast frozen in. Then he pulled it out with a cross pull, and it snapped short off. That's why Bruin goes about with a stumpy tail this very day.</p>
