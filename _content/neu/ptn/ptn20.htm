<p>Once on a time there was a woman who went out to hire a herdsman, and she met a bear.</p>  
<p>"Whither away, Goody?" said Bruin.</p>  
<p>"Oh, I'm going out to hire a herdsman," answered the woman.</p>  
<p>"Why not have me for a herdsman?" said Bruin.</p>  
<p>"Well, why not?" said the woman. "If you only knew how to call the flock; just let me hear."</p>  
<p>"OW, OW!" growled the bear.</p>  
<p>"No, no! I won't have you," said the woman, as soon as she heard him say that, and off she went on her way.</p>  
<p>So, when she had gone a bit farther, she met a wolf.</p>  
<p>"Whither away, Goody?" asked the Wolf.</p>  
<p>"Oh," said she, "I'm going out to hire a herdsman."</p>  
<p>"Why not have me for a herdsman?" said the Wolf.</p>  
<p>"Well, why not? if you can only call the flock; let me hear," said she.</p>  
<p>"Uh, uh!" said the Wolf.</p>  
<p>"No, no!" said the woman; "you'll never do for me."</p>  
<p>Well, after she had gone a while longer, she met a fox.</p>  
<p>"Whither away, Goody?" asked the Fox.</p>  
<p>"Oh, I'm just going out to hire a herdsman," said the woman.</p>  
<p><a name="page_70"><font size="1" color="green">p. 70</font></A></p>  
<p>"Why not have me for your herdsman?" asked the Fox.</p>  
<p>"Well, why not?" said she; "if you only knew how to call the flock; let me hear."</p>  
<p>"Dil-dal-holom," sung out the Fox, in such a fine clear voice.</p>  
<p>"Yes; I'll have you for my herdsman," said the woman; and so she set the Fox to herd her flock.</p>  
<p>The first day the Fox was herdsman he ate up all the woman's goats; the next day he made an end of all her sheep; and the third day he ate up all her kine. So, when he came home at even, the woman asked what he had done with all her flocks?</p>  
<p>"Oh!" said the Fox, "their skulls are in the stream, and their bodies in the holt."</p>  
<p>Now, the Goody stood and churned when the Fox said this, but she thought she might as well step out and see after her flock; and while she was away the Fox crept into the churn and ate up the cream. So when the Goody came back and saw that, she fell into such a rage, that she snatched up the little morsel of the cream that was left, and threw it at the Fox as he ran off, so that he got a dab of it on the end of his tail, and that's the reason why the fox has a white tip to his brush.</p>
