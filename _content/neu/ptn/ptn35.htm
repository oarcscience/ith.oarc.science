<p>A sportsman went out once into a wood to shoot, and he met a Snipe.</p>  
<p>"Dear friend," said the Snipe, "don't shoot my children?"</p>  
<p>"How shall I know your children?" asked the Sports-man; "what are they like?"</p>  
<p>"Oh!" said the Snipe, "mine are the prettiest children in all the wood."</p>  
<p>"Very well," said the Sportsman, "I'll not shoot them; don't be afraid."</p>  
<p>But for all that, when he came back, there he had a whole string of young snipes in his hand which he had shot.</p>  
<p>"Oh! oh!" said the Snipe, "why did you shoot my children after all?"</p>  
<p>"What, these your children!" said the Sportsman; "why, I shot the ugliest I could find, that I did!"</p>  
<p>"Woe is me!" said the Snipe; "don't you know that each one thinks his own children the prettiest in the world?"</p>
