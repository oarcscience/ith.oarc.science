<span id="_Toc29619168">CHAPTER XXI</span>

ONE day Arngrim asked Steinolf if he would go down with him to Grund to
a club-feast, and stay two or three nights. He replied, "I will stay at
home now and go some other time when you are here." Arngrim expressed a
hope that he would wait for his return, if he would not accompany him,
and he went on to Grund, but Steinolf stayed over the night. In the
morning Steinolf was sitting by the fire, with some work in hand; it was
a certain casket which belonged to the lady of the house. At that moment
Arngrim returned home with Thorvald the crooked, and as they came into
the sitting-room Steinolf was bending down over his work. Then Arngrim
struck him on the head in such a way as to cause his death; but the
mistress of the house came up to him and exclaimed, "Wretch that thou
are to strike this blow! This is the work of wiser men than thou art;
but from this day I will never be they wife." She went to the house of
Arnor Kerlingarnef and never came together with Arngrim again; but
before she rode off she said, "It will be some consolation, Arngrim,
that your days are to be few, for those which are to come will be worse
for you." Afterwards she became the wife of Asgrim, Ellidagrim’s son.  
        Arngrim and Thorvald rode to Espihole and told Thorarin what had
happened, asking for his protection, and adding that whilst they had
neither the wisdom nor the popularity to hold their own against Glum, he
(Thorarin) had abundance of both. He replied to them and said that the
deed seemed to be bad, and one from which apprehended evil consequences.
Thorvald thought it was no use to find fault with what had been done,
and that if he did not support them, he would soon have greater
difficulties on his hands. They hoped to get other people to help them,
if he would speak on their behalf. "My counsel," says Thorarin, "is that
you should both remove from Grund and Mödrufell, and that we should
collect men as soon as we may, and join our households together, before
Glum is informed of it." They did this before Glum heard what had
occurred; but when he learnt it he assembled his people, who proceeded
to attack them. However, there was no opportunity for doing so with
effect, as the men of Espihole had the larger force, and so they
remained quiet for the winter. Glum, on the other hand, was never to be
got at; he was so cautious about himself that he never slept in the bed
which had been prepared for him. Very often he rested little at night,
but he and Márr walked up and down and talked about lawsuits. One night
Márr asked him how he had slept, and Glum answered by a stanza--

" ‘Mid all this strife and tumult now  
Sleep doth mine eyelids flee.  
These men will find it hard, I trow,  
To make their peace with me,  
  
Before upon their crests shall ring  
My sword in battle-fray.  
I’ve slain men for a small thing,  
And why not these, I pray?

Now I will tell you of my dream. Methought I went out of the homestead
here by myself and without arms, and Thorarin seemed to come at me with
a large whetstone in his hand, and I felt ill prepared for our meeting;
but whilst I was thinking about it I saw another whetstone lying close
by me, so I cuaght it up and attacked him, and when we met either tried
to strike the other, but the two stones came against one another and
there was a tremendous crash." "Was it such," asked Márr, "as might be
considered a conflict between the two houses?" "More than that," replied
Glum. "Did it seem that it might represent a conflict between the two
districts?" "Yes," said Glum, "the omen may well be reckoned such, for I
thought the crash could be heard all over the district, and when I woke
I sung as follows

"I thought this night to see in sleep  
that chief, who o’er the sea  
guides the fierce raven of the deep,  
Smite with a stone at me.  
  
"The lord of Limafirth’s broad strand  
Came on in all his pride,  
I met him fearless hand to hand  
And dash’d the blow aside.

Márr observed it was very likely the old saying would come true, "Each
of you will smite the other with and evil stone before it is over."
"Yes," said Glum, "it is not improbable; there are many bodings tending
that way. There is another dream to tell you. Methought I was standing
out of doors, and that I saw two women who had a trough between them,
and they took their stations at Hrisateig and sprinkled the whole
district with blood. I woke up, and I think this portends something
which is to happen. Then I sung these verses--

"The gods--methought, they swept along  
Across the path of men.  
the clash of swords and the javelin’s song  
We shall hear full soon again.  
  
"I saw the maids of carnage stand,  
In grim and vengeful mood,  
As the battle rag’d, and they drench’d the land  
In slaughter’d warriors blood."

That morning Márr rode to Mödrufell, with seventeen other men, to summon
Arngrim for the death of Steinolf; but Glum remained at home with five
men besides himself, and told them to be quick in getting back again. In
the house with Glum were Jöd, and Eyiolf, the son of Thorleif the tall,
Thorvald Tafalld, Glum’s nephew, and two thralls.
