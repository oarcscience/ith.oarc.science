</FONT><P>GLUM </B>now assumed a high position in the district. There was a man named Gunnstein, who lived at L&oacute;n in H&ouml;gardal, a great and rich man, reckoned to be one of the most important persons in the land. He had a wife called Hlif, and their son was Thorgrim, generally known as "Thorgrim the son of Hlif," being called after his mother because she outlived his father. She was a woman of a high spirit, and Thorgrim himself was all that a man ought to be, and became eminent. Another son of theirs was Grim, surnamed "Eyrarleggr," and their daughter was Halldora, who was a beautiful woman of a gentle temper. She was esteemed to be about the best match in the country both on account of her kindred and of her own accomplishments and great qualities. Glum paid his addresses to her, stating that he did not want the help of kinsmen to explain what his family or his property and personal merits were. "All that you know well enough, and I have set my mind on this marriage is so be that it is agreeable to her friends." He received a favourable answer to his suit, and Halldora was betrothed to him with a great portion; so the wedding went of prosperously, and Glum&#146;s position became one of more dignity that it was before.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thorvald was the son of Reim, who lived at Bard, in "the Fleets:" &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> he had to wife Thurida, the daughter of Thord of H&ouml;fdi. Their children were Klaufi and Thorgerda, whom Thorarin of Espihole had married. Thorvald the crooked of Grund wedded Thorkatla of Thiors&aacute;dal. Hlenni the Old, the son of Ornolf "Wallet-back," dwelt at Vidines, and he had to wife Otkatla, the daughter of Otkel of Thiors&aacute;dal. Gizor was the son of Kadal, and lived at "The Tarns," in the valley of Eyjafirth; his wife was named Saldis, and she was a worthy matron. Gizor was one of the most considerable landowners, well to do in respect of property, with two daughters, named Thordis and Herpruda, both handsome women, who were distinguished in dress and appearance and were considered good matches. They grew up to womanhood at home. Gizor&#146;s brother was called Runolf, and he was the father of Valgerda, mother of Eyiolf of M&ouml;drufell. Thordis was Kadal&#146;s daughter, and she was married to Thorir of Espihole, and they had the children who have been named before. Thorgrim, however, the son of Thorir, although born in wedlock, was not the child of Thordis. He was a brave and well conditioned man, and he set out to meet Gizor and ask Thordis his daughter to wife for himself. His brothers and kinsmen too were engaged in pressing this suit. The maiden&#146;s relatives thought that they ought all to have a voice in the disposal of their kinswoman, and they all considered the proposal an excellent one; but notwithstanding this Thorgrim was refused. It seemed to pepole in general that Thorgrim had proposed a fair and equal match, and his brothers and kinsmen were offended at his rejection.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_11"></A><A HREF="vig13.htm#fr_11">1</A> As a general rule I have not attempted to translate the proper names, but in this case and in that of "the Tarns" I have given the corresponding English appelations. The shallow pieces of water in the Essex marshes are still called "Fleets," and "Tarn" is well known in the north of England.</P>
