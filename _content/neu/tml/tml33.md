WHEN Helgi won his kingdom and his bride, Sinfjotle returned again unto
Hunaland. Thereafter he set to warring in distant realms, and he
achieved widespread renown and won much treasure. Now it chanced that
his eyes fell with love upon an alien maid of exceeding great beauty,
and he sought to have her for himself. But she was also desired by the
brother of Borghild, Sigmund's queen. So the two fought together, and
Sinfjotle slew his rival and laid waste and plundered his land.
Thereafter he returned home and brought tidings of his deeds.

Wrothful was Borghild, and she sought to drive her brother's slayer from
the kingdom; but Sigmund would brook not such an evil doing. So he made
offer of blood treasure to his queen, and she made pretence to be
appeased, knowing well she could prevail not against the king's will.
Yet in her secret heart she brooded over her brother's death and
resolved to be avenged upon Sinfjotle. So she held a funeral feast, and
went round with the mead horn among the war men who had gathered in the
hall. When she asked Sinfjotle to drink, he feared

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

to partake, and Sigmund seized the horn and emptied it. A second time
was the horn filled by Borghild, and a second time Sigmund took it from
his son. But the third time Sinfjotle must needs drain the horn himself,
and when he did that he fell down and died, because the drink was
poisoned. Thus did Borghild take vengeance on her brother's slayer.

Great was the grief of Sigmund when Sinfjotle was dead. The war-men in
the hall feared that his sorrow would kill him. Loud mourning was heard
there then at the funeral feast, and Sigmund, who had grown old,
lamented long for his son. Then tenderly he took Signy's offspring in
his arms--that Volsung of Volsungs--and bore him through the evening
dusk towards the firth's grey beach with purpose to take him to the
opposing shore.

He perceived a small boat. In it was a tall, old man, grave of aspect,
grey bearded, and having but one eye. A round hat was drawn low on his
forehead, and he wore a dim blue cloak mottled with grey. Men tell it
was Odin, but Sigmund knew not who it was.

Unto him the grey ferryman spake, bidding him lay Sinfjotle's body in
the boat; but he said there was no room for Sigmund, who must needs go
round the firth end if he would reach the opposing shore. So Sigmund
parted with him and hastened over the beach. Ere long he turned round to
gaze upon the boat as it went over the waters. . . . Suddenly it
vanished from his sight. . . . So passed Sinfjotle, son of Sigmund and
Signy, whose grandsire was mighty Volsung of Odin's kin.

Sigmund turned homeward. He entered the hall sorrowing. He drave forth
Borghild, remembering how Sinfjotle died, and she became an outcast, so
that ere long she perished.

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

Then Sigmund sought another bride. Hjordis, daughter of King Eylime, was
comely in his eyes, and he sent messengers to her sire beseeching her
for wife. Now King Lynge, son of King Hunding whom Helgi had slain,
desired also to have the fair princess. Her sire would favour neither
Sigmund nor Lynge, and gave the maid her choice; and she vowed she would
wed the Volsung. 'Twas thus it befell, and a great marriage feast was
held. Then Sigmund returned to Hunaland with his bride, and King Eylime
went with them.

Wroth was King Lynge. Tidings he sent unto Sigmund that he would war
against him and shatter the power of the Volsungs. So he assembled a
great army and set forth to wreak his vengeance and capture Hjordis.

Sigmund feared the issue of battle, for the stronger force was with
Lynge. But his courage faltered not. Great treasures have warriors
gained, but Odin gave Sigmund a sword. Although he had grown old, his
faith in Gram was strong. Yet he deemed it best that Hjordis should be
concealed, and with a bondmaid, and bearing much treasure, the queen was
given safe retreat in a deep forest.

A great shore battle was fought. Sigmund contended fiercely against
overwhelming odds. None could stand against him, and for a time it
seemed that Lynge could not prevail. Sigmund's arms were red with blood
of his foeman, nor got he a single wound.

Then entered the field through Lynge's war-men an old and one-eyed man.
He wore a blue cloak, and his round hat was drawn low on his brow. In
his hand was a great spear, and he went against Sigmund.

That was the Volsung's fateful hour. Odin desired his death.. The god
shook his great spear, and when Sigmund smote it the sword Gram broke in
twain. There

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

upon Lynge's war-men fell upon the hero and gave him his deathwound.
King Eylime, who fought by Sigmund's side, was slain, and the Volsung
army was scattered in flight. The shoreland was red with heroes' blood
numerous as dead leaves were the bodies of the slain.

King Lynge waited not on the battleground. He pressed onward with his
army towards Sigmund's hall; but when he reached it he could find not
Hjordis nor any treasure. So search was made through all the kingdom,
and although Lynge found not the bride he sought, he was made glad
because that the Volsung power was ended and the. last of the line was
slain. But he recked not of a hero unborn, and although he set an alien
ruler over Hunaland the glory of the Volsungs was fated to return again
in greater splendour.

Now when night fell, Hjordis went towards the battleground and found
Sigmund where he lay grievously wounded and awaiting death.

She sought to give him healing, so that he might avenge her sire; but
Sigmund told her that his wounds could heal not, for Odin desired his
death, and his sword Gram was shattered.

"I have fought while Odin willed it," he said, "and now 'tis his desire
that I should die."

Then he counselled Hjordis to keep the broken sword, so that it might be
welded for her son unborn, and he foretold that the babe would grow up
to achieve renown which would live through the ages.

"Now," said Sigmund faintly, "I am death-weary, and must go hence to be
with my kin."

All night long Hjordis sat beside the dying king. She soothed him; she
watched him tenderly, and when dawn was breaking golden in the east she
dosed his eyes in death, and wept over him.

</span>

 

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

Then seaward she gazed and beheld a fleet of viking ships coming nigh to
the shore. Hastily she bade her bondmaid change raiment with her,
saying: "Henceforth thou shalt say that thy name is Hjordis."

The leader of the viking horde was Alv, son of King Hjaalprek of
Denmark. He came ashore with his warmen. He spoke to Hjordis and her
maid, and was told of the hidden treasure, and that he took speedily on
board a war ship. The queen he took also and her bondmaid.

Then Alv returned to Denmark, and ever he deemed that the bondmaid was
Sigmund's queen, but Hjaalprek's spouse, when she beheld the two women,
suspected that the bondmaid was the nobler of the two.

To the king she spoke secretly thereanent, and Hjaalprek fell to
questioning the pair. First he addressed her who pretended to be queen,
and said:

"How knowest thou the hour of rising in wintertime when the stars are
clouded over?"

The bondmaid answered him, saying: "It hath been my wont to drink
heavily at dawn, and I awake athirst."

"A strange custom for a king's daughter," the king remarked.

Then Hjaalprek asked of Hjordis how she could tell when the hour of
rising came, and she answered thus:--

"My sire gifted me a magic gold ring, and it turns ice-cold on my finger
when the hour cometh to rise in the wintertime."

The king laughed. "No bondmaid's sire giveth gold rings. A king's
daughter art thou. Of this thou shouldst have told us heretofore."

Then Hjordis made confession that she was indeed Sigmund's queen, and
thereafter she was honoured and well loved in the Hall of Hjaalprek.

When her son was born, the name he received was

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

Sigurd. A Volsung was he indeed. Bright were his eyes, and his face was
kingly, and Hjaalprek took pride in him. He grew up to be strong and
fearless; a warman's skill had he ever and Volsung pride, and he had
great wisdom, and was eloquent of speech.

His foster father was Regin, the wonder, Smith, brother of the dragon
Fafner, and he gave the lad instruction in many arts, and in the mystery
of runes, and taught him many languages.

One day Regin asked the lad if he knew that his father had left great
treasure, and that Hjaalprek guarded it; and Sigurd said it was guarded
for him and he had faith in the king. Then Regin urged him to ask a
horse from Hjaalprek, and when the lad did that the king bade him select
the one he desired.

An old, grey-bearded man, with one eye, came to Sigurd, who knew not
that he was Odin, and he chose for the lad a steed which was of
Sleipner's race. Sigurd called it Grane because it was grey, nor was its
equal [to](errata.htm#3) be found in the world.

Now Alv took Hjordis for wife, and they lived happily together.

Then a day came when Regin, perceiving that the lad grew to manhood's
strength and wisdom while he was yet young, bethought to tell him of the
treasure over which the dragon Fafner kept constant guard. He urged
Sigurd to slay the monster.

"I am scarce more than a child yet," Sigurd said; "why dost thou urge me
to do this mighty deed?"

Then Regin told the story of the treasure, and how Loke had taken it
from the dwarf Andvari; how it was given to his own sire, whom his
brother Fafner slew so that he might have all the gold for himself.

Sigurd heard him in silence, and when Regin said:

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

"If thou shalt go forth to slay Fafner I shall forge a mighty sword for
thee."

So the lad said: "Forge then a sword for me which shall be without an
equal, for fain would I do mighty deeds."

Then Regin went to his smithy and made a sword; but the lad smote it on
the anvil and it flew in pieces. A second sword he splintered
also. <span id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_92)

Thereafter Sigurd went to his mother and asked for the broken pieces of
his sire's great sword Gram. Then he bade Regin forge it anew, and the
Smith did that, although unwillingly. When it was made, the lad put the
blade to test and clove the anvil in twain. Next he cut wool with it in
the river, so keen was its edge. He was well pleased with Gram.

Regin then bade him promise to slay Fafner, and Sigurd said: "As I
promised thee, so shall I do, but first I must set forth to avenge the
death of my sire."

Stronger grew the lad, and he was of great stature <span
id="fr_93"></span>[2](#fn_93) and skilled in feats of arms. Ere he set
forth to do deeds of valour he paid visit to Griper, his mother's
brother, who had power to foretell what would come to pass. Sigurd
desired to know what the norns had decreed regarding him, and although
Griper was at first unwilling to tell him, he at last unfolded to the
lad his whole future life.

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

Thereafter Sigurd went to the king and besought that he should get ships
and war-men to go forth against the tribe of Hunding, and avenge upon
King Lynge the death of Sigmund. Hjaalprek gave him according to his
desire. A great storm broke forth as he crossed the seas, and as the
ships came nigh a headland a man beckoned to Sigurd and desired to be
taken aboard. The young hero commanded that this should be done. His
name was Fjorner <span id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_94), and he carried out
the behests of Urd. He sang strange runes regarding the battle that was
to be. As he did so the storm passed away, and they drew nigh to the
kingdom of King Lynge. Then Fjorner vanished.

Sigurd laid waste the country, and tidings were borne to King Lynge that
fierce foemen had invaded the kingdom. A great army was collected to
oppose them, but Sigurd was given victory, and he slew Lynge, and thus
avenged his sire's death. With the sword Gram he clove the king in
twain, and all the sons of Hunding who were there he slew also. So did
Sigurd achieve great renown, and with the treasure he had captured he
returned unto Hjaalprek.

Ere long Regin spake to him in secret, calling to mind his promise to
slay the dragon Fafner.

"As I have promised," Sigurd said, "so shall I do."

Regin went forth towards the Glittering Heath with the young hero, whom
he counselled to make a pit so that he might slay the dragon from
beneath when it came out to drink.

"If the dragon's blood fills up the pit, how will it fare with me?"
Sigurd exclaimed.

"Thou seem'st to be afraid," Regin said. "'Unlike thy kin art thou."

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

Sigurd went towards the dragon's dwelling, but Regin waited at a
distance. Then to the young hero came an old and grey-bearded man with
one eye, and he gave counsel that he should dig many pits, so that the
blood of the dragon might not drown him. <span
id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_95) Sigurd knew not that the man was Odin, but
he did as he was advised: he dug many pits, and in one of them he
concealed himself and waited for the dragon to come forth.

In time Fafner crawled from his lair, roaring and spouting venom. The
earth shook, and Regin trembled in his hiding place. But Sigurd was not
afraid. He waited until the monster was over the pit in which he stood,
then he plunged his sword Gram through the dragon right up to the hilt.
He drew it forth again, and the blood reddened his arms, and ran into
the pits.

Fafner tossed in fury, and destroyed all things that were nigh him, but
soon he knew well that he was wounded unto death. As he lay helpless and
weak he beheld Sigurd coming forth.

Fafner spake and asked him: "Who art thou that feared me not? What is
thy name, and what is thy sire's name?"

Sigurd answered: "My folk are strangers among men. My name is Lordly
Beast. I have nor sire nor mother, and hither came I alone." <span
id="fr_96"></span>[2](#fn_96)

Fafner said: "Wilt thou lie to me in my hour of death) by saying that
thou hast nor sire nor mother or other name than Lordly Beast?"

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

Sigurd thereupon said: "My name is Sigurd, and I am Sigmund's son."

"Brave was thy sire," said the dragon, "but didst thou never hear that I
was feared among men? Name thou him who urged thee to slay me."

Sigurd told not of Regin, and the dragon warned him that the gold would
be a curse to him.

But the young hero said: "We can but keep our gold till life's end, and
a man dieth once only."

Fafner then said: "By Regin was I betrayed. Thee too would he betray; he
desires my death and thine."

Soon afterwards the dragon died, whereupon Regin came forth from his
hiding place. He came humbly towards the young hero and spake words of
flattery to him. Then he said: "But, alas! thou hast slain my brother,
nor am I myself without blame."

Sigurd said angrily: "When I performed this great deed thou didst crouch
like a coward in a bush."

"It was I who forged the sword with which thou didst slay Fafner," said
Regin.

Then Sigurd answered: "Better in battle is a brave heart than a strong
sword."

Again Regin said: "Alas! thou hast slain my brother, nor am I myself
without blame."

Sigurd cut out the dragon's heart, and Regin drank the blood. Then the
wonder smith bade the young hero to roast the heart for him while he lay
down to sleep. The lad thrust a rod through it and roasted it over a
fire. When the heart frizzled he laid his finger on the spot, lest the
blood should come forth, and then he thrust his finger in his mouth.
When he did that he at once understood the language of birds. <span
id="fr_97"></span>[1](#fn_97)

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

One bird sang: "Why dost thou sit roasting the dragon's heart for
another when thou shouldst eat it thyself and obtain great wisdom?"

Another sang: "Regin lies there with purpose in his heart to betray
Sigurd."

A third sang: "Sigurd should slay Regin and possess all the treasure for
himself."

The first bird sang: "Regin hath drunk of the dragon's blood and will
become a wolf. Sigurd would be wise if he thought of his own safety. He
who hath a wolf's ears will soon have the teeth of a wolf."

Another bird sang: "Sigurd will be less wise than I deem him to be if he
spares the man who desired his -own brother's death."

Sigurd leapt up. "The day hath not come when Regin shall slay me," he
said, and at once cut off the head of the wonder smith.

Then the young hero ate a portion of Fafner's heart, <span
id="fr_98"></span>[1](#fn_98) and took the rest with him. Thereafter he
went to the dragon's lair and took forth the treasure--the rings, the
awesome helmet, the sword Hrotte, gold armour, and many ornaments. In
two chests he placed the treasure, and these he put upon the back of his
strong steed Grane.

The birds sang to him.

"There is a maid most fair if thou couldst possess her.

"Green roads twine to the hall of Giuki, and thither

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

is Sigurd led. The king hath a daughter and thou hast gold for her. . .
."

"On Hindarfell there is a high and gold-decked hall; it is girt around
with fire. . . .

"There sleepeth on the fell a maid of war, a chosen of heroes; flames
flash round her. Odin hath given her long and unbroken sleep, for she
hath stricken down those whom he favoured. Brynhild's sleep is sure and
lasting; thus have the norns decreed."

So Sigurd rode on. The birds sang to him and he heard with wonder. Nor
rested he on the green-girt way until he came to Hindarfell, where
Brynhild lay wrapped in a magic sleep.

### The Sleeping Beauty

Year after year unto her feet,  
  She lying on a couch alone,  
Across the purple coverlet,  
  The maiden's jet-black hair has grown  
On either side her trancèd form  
  Forth streaming from a braid of pearl;  
The slumbrous light is rich and warm,  
  And moves not on the rounded curl.

The silk star-broidered coverlid  
  Unto her limbs itself doth mould  
Languidly ever; and, amid  
  Her full black ringlets downward roll'd,  
Glows forth each softly shadow'd arm  
  With bracelets of the diamond bright;  
Her constant beauty doth inform  
  Stillness with love, and day with light.

She sleeps: her breathings are not heard  
  In palace chambers far apart.<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>  
The fragrant tresses are not stirr'd  
  That lie upon her charmed heart.  
She sleeps on either hand upswells  
  The gold-fringed pillow lightly prest:  
She sleeps, nor dreams, but ever dwells  
  A perfect form in perfect rest.

   .       .       .       .       .       .

He comes, scarce knowing what he seeks:  
  He breaks the hedge: he enters there:  
The colour flies into his cheeks:  
  He trusts to light on something fair:  
For all his life the charm did talk  
  About his path, and hover near  
With words of promise in his walk,  
  And whispered voices at his ear.  
                                             *Tennyson*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_92"></span>[315:1](tml33.htm#fr_92) A similar story is told
in the Highlands of Finn (Fingal), who shook sword after sword to pieces
until the smith forged a matchless blade Which had to be tempered with
the blood of the first living thing that entered the smithy in the
morning. Finn slew the smith. Both stories are probably of common
origin.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[315:2](tml33.htm#fr_93) The Highland Finn was
60 feet high, and Garry was a dwarf because he was but 40 feet in
height. Sigurd did not attain such godlike stature, but he was,
according to Saga statistics, nearly 20 feet high; for when his sword
was girt on, the end of it touched the ears of growing rye. The sword
was seven spans in length. Finn also avenged his father's death, but he
never slew a dragon nor sought great treasure. His ambitions were those
of a huntsman.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[316:1](tml33.htm#fr_94) One of Odin's names.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[317:1](tml33.htm#fr_95) It would appear that in
making imperfect swords and advising the construction of only one pit,
Regin desired to be rid of Sigurd when he had served his purpose.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[317:2](tml33.htm#fr_96) The reluctance shown by
Sigurd is evidence of his belief in the magical power of names. He
feared that the dragon could, by using his name, exercise an evil
influence over him. Even at the present day certain peoples in these
islands are charged with lack of courtesy because they refuse to give
their names to strangers.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[318:1](tml33.htm#fr_97) Here again we have
strong resemblance to the story of Finn. Black Arky, who slew Finn's
father, Coul, caught a certain salmon and asked the lad to roast it
without <span id="page_319">p. 319</span> raising a blister. Then he
went to sleep. A blister rose, and Finn pressed it down, and having
burnt his finger he thrust it into his mouth. He touched a tooth, and it
became his "Tooth of Knowledge". He then knew who Arky was and slew him.
In some Gaelic stories Finn bites his thumb when he desires to know
anything. There are no birds in the Finn story.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[319:1](tml33.htm#fr_98) Because of the
cannibalistic belief that by eating an enemy he would obtain from flesh
and blood whatever strength or wisdom the other possessed in life.
