<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">CONTENTS</H1>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CHAPTER I</H3>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">INTRODUCTORY</H4>
<P>Nature of the Grail problem. Unsatisfactory character of results achieved. Objections to Christian Legendary origin; to Folk-lore origin. Elements in both theories sound. Solution to be sought in a direction which will do justice to both. Sir J. G. Frazer's <I>Golden Bough</I> indicates possible line of research. Sir W. Ridgeway's criticism of <I>Vegetation</I> theory examined. <I>Dramas and Dramatic Dances</I>. The Living and not the Dead King the factor of importance. Impossibility of proving human origin for Vegetation Deities. Not Death but Resurrection the essential centre of Ritual. <I>Muharram</I> too late in date and lacks Resurrection feature. Relation between defunct heroes and special localities. Sanctity possibly antecedent to connection. <I>Mana</I> not necessarily a case of relics. Self-acting weapons frequent in Medieval Romance. Sir J. G. Frazer's theory holds good. Remarks on method and design of present Studies. pp. <A HREF="frr04.htm#page_1">1</A>-10</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CHAPTER II</H3>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">THE TASK OF THE HERO</H4>
<P>Essential to determine the original nature of the task imposed upon the hero. Versions examined. The GAWAIN forms--<I>Bleheris</I>, <I>Di&ucirc; Cr&ocirc;ne</I>. PERCEVAL versions--<I>Gerbert, prose Perceval, Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes, Perlesvaus, Manessier, Peredur, Parzival</I>. GALAHAD--<I>Queste</I>. Result, primary task healing of Fisher King and removal of curse of Waste Land. The two inter-dependent. Illness of King entails misfortune on Land. Enquiry into nature of King's disability. <I>Sone de Nansai</I>. For elucidation of problem necessary to bear in mind close connection between Land and Ruler. Importance of Waste Land <I>motif</I> for criticism. pp. <A HREF="frr05.htm#page_11">11</A>-22</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CHAPTER III</H3>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">THE FREEING OF THE WATERS</H4>
<P>Enquiry may commence with early Aryan tradition. The <I>Rig-Veda</I>. Extreme importance assigned to Indra's feat of "Freeing the Waters." This also specific achievement of Grail heroes. Extracts from <I>Rig-Veda</I>. Dramatic poems and monologues. Professor von Schroeder's theory. <I>Mysterium und Mimus</I>. <I><U>R</U>ishya&ccedil;<U>r</U>i&ntilde;ga</I> drama. Parallels with <I>Perceval</I> story. Result, the specific task of the Grail hero not a literary invention but an inheritance of Aryan tradition. pp. <A HREF="frr06.htm#page_23">23</A>-31</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CHAPTER IV</H3>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">TAMMUZ AND ADONIS</H4>
<P>General objects to be attained by these Nature Cults. Stimulation of Fertility, Animal and Vegetable. Principle of Life ultimately conceived of in anthropomorphic form. This process already advanced in <I>Rig-Veda</I>. Greek Mythology preserves intermediate stage. The <I>Eniautos Daimon</I>. TAMMUZ--earliest known representative of Dying God. Character of the worship. Origin of the name. <I>Lament for Tammuz</I>. His death affects not only Vegetable but Animal life. Lack of artistic representation of Mysteries. Mr Langdon's suggestion. Ritual possibly dramatic. Summary of evidence. ADONIS--Phoenician-Greek equivalent of Tammuz. Probably most popular and best known form of Nature Cult. Mythological tale of Adonis. Enquiry into nature of injury. Importance of recognizing true nature of these cults and of the ritual observed. Varying dates of celebration. Adonis probably originally <I>Eniautos Daimon</I>. Principle of Life in general, hence lack of fixity in date. Details of the ritual. Parallels with the Grail legend examined. Dead Knight or Disabled King. Consequent misfortunes of Land. The Weeping Women. The Hairless Maiden. Position of Castle. Summing up. Can incidents of such remote antiquity be used as criticism for a Medieval text? pp. <A HREF="frr07.htm#page_32">32</A>-48</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CHAPTER V</H3>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">MEDIEVAL AND MODERN FORMS OF NATURE RITUAL</H4>
<P>Is it possible to establish chain of descent connecting early Aryan and Babylonian Ritual with Classic, Medieval and Modern forms of Nature worship? Survival of Adonis cult established. Evidence of Mannhardt and Frazer. Existing Continental customs recognized as survivals of</P>
<P><A NAME="page_xi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xi</FONT></A></P>
<P>ancient beliefs. Instances. 'Directly related' to Attis-Adonis cult. Von Schroeder establishes parallel between existing Fertility procession and <I>Rig-Veda</I> poem. Identification of Life Principle with King. Prosperity of land dependent on king as representative of god. Celts. Greeks. Modern instances, the Shilluk Kings. Parallel between Shilluk King, Grail King and Vegetation Deity. <I>Sone de Nansai</I> and the <I>Lament for Tammuz</I>. Identity of situation. Plea for unprejudiced criticism. Impossibility of such parallels being fortuitous; the result of deliberate intention, not an accident of literary invention. If identity of central character be admitted his relation to Waste Land becomes fundamental factor in criticizing versions. Another African survival. pp. <A HREF="frr08.htm#page_49">49</A>-61</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CHAPTER VI</H3>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">THE SYMBOLS</H4>
<P>Summary of results of previous enquiry. <I>The Medieval Stage</I>. Grail romances probably contain record of secret ritual of a Fertility cult. The Symbols of the cult--Cup, Lance, Sword, Stone, or Dish. Plea for treating Symbols as a related group not as isolated units. Failure to do so probably cause of unsatisfactory result of long research. Essential to recognize Grail story as an original whole and to treat it in its <I>ensemble</I> aspect. We must differentiate between origin and accretion. Instances. <I>The Legend of Longinus</I>. Lance and Cup not associated in Christian Art. Evidence. The <I>Spear</I> of Eastern Liturgies only a <I>Knife</I>. <I>The Bleeding Lance</I>. Treasures of the Tuatha de Danann. Correspond as a group with Grail Symbols. Difficulty of equating Cauldron-Grail. Probably belong to a different line of tradition. Instances given. Real significance of Lance and Cup. Well known as Life Symbols. The Samurai. Four Symbols also preserved as Suits of the Tarot. Origin of Tarot discussed. Probably reached Europe from the East. Use of the Symbols in Magic. Probable explanation of these various appearances to be found in fact that associated group were at one time symbols of a Fertility cult. Further evidence to be examined.</P>

Recognized as representing Death and Revival of Vegetation Deity. Dr Jevons, <I>Masks and the Origin of the Greek Drama</I>. Morris Dances. No dramatic element. Costume of character significant. Possible survival of theriomorphic origin. Elaborate character of figures in each group. Symbols employed. The Pentangle. The Chalice. Present form shows dislocation. Probability that three groups were once a combined whole and Symbols united. Evidence strengthens view advanced in last Chapter. Symbols originally a group connected with lost form of Fertility Ritual. Possible origin of Grail Knights to be found in Sword Dancers. pp. <A HREF="frr10.htm#page_77">77</A>-95</P>
