# CHAPTER X

### The Secret of the Grail (1)

### The Mysteries

Students of the Grail literature cannot fail to have been impressed by a
certain atmosphere of awe and mystery which surrounds that enigmatic
Vessel. There is a secret connected with it, the revelation of which
will entail dire misfortune on the betrayer. If spoken of at all it must
be with scrupulous accuracy. It is so secret a thing that no woman, be
she wife or maid, may venture to speak of it. A priest, or a man of holy
life might indeed tell the marvel of the Grail, but none can hearken to
the recital without shuddering, trembling, and changing colour for very
fear.

"*C'est del Graal dont nus ne doit  
Le secret dire ne conter;  
Car tel chose poroit monter  
Li contes ains qu'il fust tos dis  
Que teus hom en seroit maris  
Qui ne l'aroit mie fourfait*.  
................................................  
*Car, se Maistre Blihis ne ment  
Nus ne doit dire le secré* <span id="fr_207"></span>[1](#fn_207)."

"*Mais la mervelle qu'il trova  
Dont maintes fois s'espoenta  
Ne doit nus hom conter ne dire  
Cil ki le dist en a grant ire  
Car c'est li signes del Graal* (other texts *secrés*)  
*S'en puet avoir et paine et mal* (*Li fet grant pechié et grant mal*)  
*Cil qui s'entremet del conter  
Fors ensi com it doit aler* <span id="fr_208"></span>[2](#fn_208)."

 

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

\[paragraph continues\] The above refers to Gawain's adventure at the
Black Chapel, *en route* for the Grail Castle.

The following is the answer given to Perceval by the maiden of the White
Mule, after he has been overtaken by a storm in the forest. She tells
him the mysterious light he beheld proceeded from the Grail, but on his
enquiry as to what the Grail may be, refuses to give him any
information.

"*Li dist 'Sire, ce ne puet estre  
Que je plus vos en doie dire  
Si vous .c. fois esties me sire  
N'en oseroie plus conter,  
Ne de mon labor plus parler* (other texts, *ma bouche*)  
*Car ce est chose trop secrée  
Si ne doit estre racontée  
Par dame ne par damoisele,  
Par mescine ne par puciele,  
Ne par nul home qui soit nés  
Si prouvoires n'est ordenés,  
U home qui maine sainte vie*,  
...............................................  
*Cil poroit del Graal parler,  
Et la mervelle raconter,  
Que nus hom nel poroit oïr  
Que il ne l'estuece fremir  
Trambler et remuer color,  
Et empalir de la paour* <span id="fr_209"></span>[1](#fn_209).'"

From this evidence there is no doubt that to the romance writers the
Grail was something secret, mysterious and awful, the exact knowledge of
which was reserved to a select few, and which was only to be spoken of
with bated breath, and a careful regard to strict accuracy.

But how does this agree with the evidence set forth in our preceding
chapters? There we have been led rather to

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

emphasize the close parallels existing between the characters and
incidents of the Grail story, and a certain well-marked group of popular
beliefs and observances, now very generally recognized as fragments of a
once widespread Nature Cult. These beliefs and observances, while dating
from remotest antiquity, have, in their modern survivals, of recent
years, attracted the attention of scholars by their persistent and
pervasive character, and their enduring vitality.

Yet, so far as we have hitherto dealt with them, these practices were,
and are, popular in character, openly performed, and devoid of the
special element of mystery which is so characteristic a feature of the
Grail.

Nor, in these public Folk-ceremonies, these Spring festivals, Dances,
and Plays, is there anything which, on the face of it, appears to bring
them into touch with the central mystery of the Christian Faith. Yet the
men who wrote these romances saw no incongruity in identifying the
mysterious Food-providing Vessel of the *Bleheris-Gawain* version with
the Chalice of the Eucharist, and in ascribing the power of bestowing
Spiritual Life to that which certain modern scholars have identified as
a *Wunsch-Ding*, a Folk-tale Vessel of Plenty.

If there be a mystery of the Grail surely the mystery lies here, in the
possibility of identifying two objects which, apparently, lie at the
very opposite poles of intellectual conception. What brought them
together? Where shall we seek a connecting link? By what road did the
romancers reach so strangely unexpected a goal?

It is, of course, very generally recognized that in the case of most of
the pre-Christian religions, upon the nature and character of whose
rites we possess reliable information, such rites possessed a two-fold
character--*exoteric*; in celebrations openly and publicly performed, in
which all adherents of that particular cult could join freely, the
object of such

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

public rites being to obtain some external and material benefit, whether
for the individual worshipper, or for the community as a
whole--*esoteric*; rites open only to a favoured few, the initiates, the
object of which appears, as a rule, to have been individual rather than
social, and non-material. In some cases, certainly, the object aimed at
was the attainment of a conscious, ecstatic, union with the god, and the
definite assurance of a future life. In other words there was the public
worship, and there were the Mysteries.

Of late years there has been a growing tendency among scholars to seek
in the Mysteries the clue which shall enable us to read aright the
baffling riddle of the Grail, and there can be little doubt that, in so
doing, we are on the right path. At the same time I am convinced that to
seek that clue in those Mysteries which are at once the most famous, and
the most familiar to the classical scholar, *i.e.*, the Eleusinian, is a
fatal mistake. There are, as we shall see, certain essential, and
radical, differences between the Greek and the Christian religious
conceptions which, affecting as they do the root conceptions of the two
groups, render it quite impossible that any form of the Eleusinian
Mystery cult could have given such results as we find in the Grail
legend <span id="fr_210"></span>[1](#fn_210).

Cumont in his *Les Religions Orientales dans le Paganisme Romain*,
speaking of the influence of the Mysteries upon Christianity, remarks
acutely, "Or, lorsqu'on parle de mystères on doit songer à l'Asie
hellénisée, bien plus qu'à la Grèce propre, malgré tout le prestige qui
entourait Eleusis, car d'abord les premières communautés Chrétiennes se
font fondées, formées, développées, au milieu de populations Orientales,
Sémites, Phrygiens, Egyptiens <span id="fr_211"></span>[2](#fn_211)."

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

This is perfectly true, but it was not only the influence of *milieu*,
not only the fact that the 'hellenized' faiths were, as Cumont points
out, more advanced, richer in ideas and sentiments, more pregnant, more
poignant, than the more strictly 'classic' faiths, but they possessed,
in common with Christianity, certain distinctive features lacking in
these latter.

If we were asked to define the special characteristic of the central
Christian rite, should we not state it as being a Sacred meal of
Communion in which the worshipper, not merely symbolically, but
actually, partakes of, and becomes one with, his God, receiving thereby
the assurance of eternal life? (*The Body of Our Lord Jesus Christ
preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life*.)

But it is precisely this conception which is lacking in the Greek
Mysteries, and that inevitably, as Rohde points out: "The Eleusinian
Mysteries in common with all Greek religion, differentiated clearly
between gods and men, *eins ist der Menschen, ein andres der
Götter-Geschlecht*--ἓν ἀνδρῶν, ἓν θεῶν γένος." The attainment of union
with the god, by way of ecstasy, as in other Mystery cults, is foreign
to the Eleusinian idea. As Cumont puts it "The Greco-Roman deities
rejoice in the perpetual calm and youth of Olympus, the Eastern deities
die to live again <span id="fr_212"></span>[1](#fn_212)." In other words
Greek religion lacks the Sacramental idea.

Thus even if we set aside the absence of a parallel between the ritual
of the Greek Mysteries and the *mise-en-scène* of the Grail stories,
Eleusis would be unable to offer us those essential elements which would
have rendered possible a translation of the incidents of those stories
into terms of high Christian symbolism. Yet we cannot refrain from the
conclusion that there was something in the legend that not merely
rendered possible, but actually invited, such a translation.

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

If we thus dismiss, as fruitless for our investigation, the most famous
representative of the Hellenic Mysteries proper, how does the question
stand with regard to those faiths to which Cumont is referring, the
hellenized cults of Asia Minor?

Here the evidence, not merely of the existence of Mysteries, but of
their widespread popularity, and permeating influence, is overwhelming;
the difficulty is not so much to prove our case, as to select and
co-ordinate the evidence germane to our enquiry.

Regarding the question as a whole it is undoubtedly true that, as Anrich
remarks, "the extent of the literature devoted to the Mysteries stands
in no relation whatever (*gar keinem Verhältniss*) to the importance in
reality attached to them <span id="fr_213"></span>[1](#fn_213)." Later
in the same connection, after quoting Clement of Alexandria's dictum
"Geheime Dinge wie die Gottheit, werden der Rede anvertraut, nicht der
Schrift," he adds, "*Schriftliche Fixierung ist schon beinahe
Entweihung* <span id="fr_214"></span>[2](#fn_214)." A just remark which
it would be well if certain critics who make a virtue of refusing to
accept as evidence anything short of a direct and positive literary
statement would bear in mind. There are certain lines of research in
which, as Bishop Butler long since emphasized, probability must be our
guide.

Fortunately, however, so far as our present research is concerned, we
have more than probability to rely upon; not only did these Nature Cults
with which we are dealing express themselves in Mystery terms, but as
regards these special Mysteries we possess clear and definite
information, and we know, moreover, that in the Western world they were,
of all the Mystery faiths, the most widely spread, and the most
influential.

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

As Sir J. G. Frazer has before now pointed out, there are parallel and
over-lapping forms of this cult, the name of the god, and certain
details of the ritual, may differ in different countries, but whether he
hails from Babylon, Phrygia, or Phoenicia, whether he be called Tammuz,
Attis, or Adonis, the main lines of the story are fixed, and invariable.
Always he is young and beautiful, always the beloved of a great goddess;
always he is the victim of a tragic and untimely death, a death which
entails bitter loss and misfortune upon a mourning world, and which, for
the salvation of that world, is followed by a resurrection. Death and
Resurrection, mourning and rejoicing, present themselves in sharp
antithesis in each and all of the forms.

We know the god best as Adonis, for it was under that name that, though
not originally Greek, he became known to the Greek world, was adopted by
them with ardour, carried by them to Alexandria, where his feast assumed
the character of a State solemnity; under that name his story has been
enshrined in Art, and as Adonis he is loved and lamented to this day.
The Adonis ritual may be held to be the classic form of the cult.

But in Rome, the centre of Western civilization, it was otherwise: there
it was the Phrygian god who was in possession; the dominating position
held by the cult of Attis and the *Magna Mater*, and the profound
influence exercised by that cult over better known, but subsequently
introduced, forms of worship, have not, so far, been sufficiently
realized.

The first of the Oriental cults to gain a footing in the Imperial city,
the worship of the *Magna Mater* of Pessinonte was, for a time, rigidly
confined within the limits of her sanctuary. The orgiastic ritual of the
priests of Kybele made at first little appeal to the more disciplined
temperament of the Roman population. By degrees, however, it won its

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

way, and by the reign of Claudius had become so popular that the emperor
instituted public feasts in honour of Kybele and Attis, feasts which
were celebrated at the Spring solstice, March 15th-27th <span
id="fr_215"></span>[1](#fn_215).

As the public feast increased in popularity, so did the Mystery feast,
of which the initiated alone were privileged to partake, acquire a
symbolic significance: the foods partaken of became "un aliment de vie
spirituelle, et doivent soutenir dans les épreuves de la vie l'initié."
Philosophers boldly utilized the framework of the Attis cult as the
vehicle for imparting their own doctrines, "Lorsque le Nèoplatonisme
triomphera la fable Phrygienne deviendra le moule traditionnel dans
lequel des exégètes subtils verseront hardiment leurs spéculations
philosophiques sur les forces créatrices fécondantes, principes de
toutes les formes matérielles, et sur la délivrance de l'âme divine
plongée dans la corruption de ce monde terrestre <span
id="fr_216"></span>[2](#fn_216)."

Certain of the Gnostic sects, both pre- and post-Christian, appear to
have been enthusiastic participants in the Attis mysteries <span
id="fr_217"></span>[3](#fn_217); Hepding, in his *Attis* study, goes so
far as to refer to Bishop Aberkios, to whose enigmatic epitaph our
attention was directed in the last chapter, as "*der
Attis-Preister* <span id="fr_218"></span>[4](#fn_218)."

Another element aided in the diffusion of the ritual. Of all the
Oriental cults which journeyed Westward under the aegis of Rome none was
so deeply rooted or so widely spread as the originally Persian cult of
Mithra--the popular religion of the Roman legionary. But between the
cults of Mithra and of Attis there was a close and intimate alliance. In
parts of Asia Minor the Persian god had early taken over features of the
Phrygian deity. "Aussitôt que nous pouvons constater la présence du
culte Persique en Italie

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

nous le trouvons étroitement uni à celui de la Grande Mére de
Pessinonte <span id="fr_219"></span>[1](#fn_219)." The union between
Mithra and the goddess Anâhita was held to be the equivalent of that
subsisting between the two great Phrygian deities Attis-Kybele. The most
ancient Mithreum known, that at Ostia, was attached to the Metroon, the
temple of Kybele. At Saalburg the ruins of the two temples are but a few
steps apart. "L'on a tout lieu de croire que le culte du dieu Iranien et
celui de la déesse Phrygienne vécurent en communion intime sur toute
l'étendue de l'Empire <span id="fr_220"></span>[2](#fn_220)."

A proof of the close union of the two cults is afforded by the mystic
rite of the Taurobolium, which was practised by both, and which, in the
West, at least, seems to have passed from the temples of the Mithra to
those of the *Magna Mater*. At the same time Cumont remarks that the
actual rite seems to have been practised in Asia from a great antiquity,
before Mithraism had attributed to it a spiritual significance. It is
thus possible that the rite had earlier formed a part of the Attis
initiation, and had been temporarily disused <span
id="fr_221"></span>[3](#fn_221).

We shall see that the union of the Mithra-Attis cults becomes of
distinct importance when we examine, (*a*) the spiritual significance of
these rituals, and their elements of affinity with Christianity, (*b*)
their possible diffusion in the British Isles.

But now what do we know of the actual details of the Attis mysteries?
The first and most important point was a Mystic Meal, at which the food
partaken of was served in the sacred vessels, the tympanum, and the
cymbals. The formula of an Attis initiate was "*I have eaten from the
tympanum, I have drunk from the cymbals*." As I have remarked above, the
food thus partaken of was a Food of Life--"*Die Attis-Diener* 

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

in der Tat eine magische Speise des Lebens aus ihren Kult-Geräten zu
essen meinten <span id="fr_222"></span>[1](#fn_222)."

Dieterich in his interesting study entitled *Eine Mithras-liturgie*
refers to this meal as the centre of the whole religious action.

Further, in some mysterious manner, the fate of the initiate was
connected with, and dependent upon, the death and resurrection of the
god. The Christian writer Firmicius Maternus, at one time himself an
initiate, has left an account of the ceremony, without, however,
specifying whether the deity in question was Attis or Adonis--as
Dieterich remarks "Was er erzählt kann sich auf Attis-gemeinden, und auf
Adonis-gemeinden beziehen."

This is what he says: "*Nocte quadam simulacrum in lectica supinum
ponitur, et per numeros digestis fletibus plangitur: deinde cum se ficta
lamentatione satiaverint lumen infertur: tunc a sacerdote omnium qui
flebant fauces unguentur, quibus perunctis sacerdos hoc lento murmure
susurrit*:

Θάρρετε μύϲται τοῦ θεοῦ ϲεϲωϲμένου·  
Ἕϲται γα'ρ ἡμῖν ἐκ πόνων ϲωτηρία--

on which Dieterich remarks: "Das Heil der Mysten hängt an der Rettung
des Gottes <span id="fr_223"></span>[2](#fn_223)."

Hepding holds that in some cases there was an actual burial, and
awakening with the god to a new life <span
id="fr_224"></span>[3](#fn_224). In any case it is clear that the
successful issue of the test of initiation was dependent upon the
resurrection and revival of the god.

Now is it not clear that we have here a close parallel with the Grail
romances? In each case we have a common, and mystic, meal, in which the
food partaken of stands in close connection with the holy vessels. In
the Attis feast the

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

initiates actually ate and drank from these vessels; in the romances the
Grail community never actually eat from the Grail itself, but the food
is, in some mysterious and unexplained manner, supplied by it. In both
cases it is a *Lebens-Speise*, a Food of Life. This point is especially
insisted upon in the *Parzival*, where the Grail community never become
any older than they were on the day they first beheld the Talisman <span
id="fr_225"></span>[1](#fn_225). In the Attis initiation the proof that
the candidate has successfully passed the test is afforded by the
revival of the god--in the Grail romances the proof lies in the healing
of the Fisher King.

Thus, while deferring for a moment any insistence on the obvious points
of parallelism with the Sacrament of the Eucharist, and the
possibilities of Spiritual teaching inherent in the ceremonies,
necessary links in our chain of argument, we are, I think, entitled to
hold that, even when we pass beyond the outward *mise-en-scène* of the
story--the march of incident, the character of the King, his title, his
disability, and relation to his land and folk--to the inner and deeper
significance of the tale, the Nature Cults still remain reliable guides;
it is their inner, their esoteric, ritual which will enable us to bridge
the gulf between what appears at first sight the wholly irreconcilable
elements of Folk-tale and high Spiritual mystery.

knife.
