<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">The Mysteries</H3>
<P>Students of the Grail literature cannot fail to have been impressed by a certain atmosphere of awe and mystery which surrounds that enigmatic Vessel. There is a secret connected with it, the revelation of which will entail dire misfortune on the betrayer. If spoken of at all it must be with scrupulous accuracy. It is so secret a thing that no woman, be she wife or maid, may venture to speak of it. A priest, or a man of holy life might indeed tell the marvel of the Grail, but none can hearken to the recital without shuddering, trembling, and changing colour for very fear.</P><DIR>

<P>From this evidence there is no doubt that to the romance writers the Grail was something secret, mysterious and awful, the exact knowledge of which was reserved to a select few, and which was only to be spoken of with bated breath, and a careful regard to strict accuracy.</P>
<P>But how does this agree with the evidence set forth in our preceding chapters? There we have been led rather to</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_132"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 132</FONT></A></P>
<P>emphasize the close parallels existing between the characters and incidents of the Grail story, and a certain well-marked group of popular beliefs and observances, now very generally recognized as fragments of a once widespread Nature Cult. These beliefs and observances, while dating from remotest antiquity, have, in their modern survivals, of recent years, attracted the attention of scholars by their persistent and pervasive character, and their enduring vitality.</P>
<P>Yet, so far as we have hitherto dealt with them, these practices were, and are, popular in character, openly performed, and devoid of the special element of mystery which is so characteristic a feature of the Grail.</P>
<P>Nor, in these public Folk-ceremonies, these Spring festivals, Dances, and Plays, is there anything which, on the face of it, appears to bring them into touch with the central mystery of the Christian Faith. Yet the men who wrote these romances saw no incongruity in identifying the mysterious Food-providing Vessel of the <I>Bleheris-Gawain</I> version with the Chalice of the Eucharist, and in ascribing the power of bestowing Spiritual Life to that which certain modern scholars have identified as a <I>Wunsch-Ding</I>, a Folk-tale Vessel of Plenty.</P>
<P>If there be a mystery of the Grail surely the mystery lies here, in the possibility of identifying two objects which, apparently, lie at the very opposite poles of intellectual conception. What brought them together? Where shall we seek a connecting link? By what road did the romancers reach so strangely unexpected a goal?</P>
<P>It is, of course, very generally recognized that in the case of most of the pre-Christian religions, upon the nature and character of whose rites we possess reliable information, such rites possessed a two-fold character--<I>exoteric</I>; in celebrations openly and publicly performed, in which all adherents of that particular cult could join freely, the object of such</P>
<P><A NAME="page_133"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 133</FONT></A></P>
<P>public rites being to obtain some external and material benefit, whether for the individual worshipper, or for the community as a whole--<I>esoteric</I>; rites open only to a favoured few, the initiates, the object of which appears, as a rule, to have been individual rather than social, and non-material. In some cases, certainly, the object aimed at was the attainment of a conscious, ecstatic, union with the god, and the definite assurance of a future life. In other words there was the public worship, and there were the Mysteries.</P>
<P>Of late years there has been a growing tendency among scholars to seek in the Mysteries the clue which shall enable us to read aright the baffling riddle of the Grail, and there can be little doubt that, in so doing, we are on the right path. At the same time I am convinced that to seek that clue in those Mysteries which are at once the most famous, and the most familiar to the classical scholar, <I>i.e.</I>, the Eleusinian, is a fatal mistake. There are, as we shall see, certain essential, and radical, differences between the Greek and the Christian religious conceptions which, affecting as they do the root conceptions of the two groups, render it quite impossible that any form of the Eleusinian Mystery cult could have given such results as we find in the Grail legend&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_210"></A><A HREF="#fn_210"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</P>
<P>Cumont in his <I>Les Religions Orientales dans le Paganisme Romain</I>, speaking of the influence of the Mysteries upon Christianity, remarks acutely, "Or, lorsqu'on parle de myst&egrave;res on doit songer &agrave; l'Asie hell&eacute;nis&eacute;e, bien plus qu'&agrave; la Gr&egrave;ce propre, malgr&eacute; tout le prestige qui entourait Eleusis, car d'abord les premi&egrave;res communaut&eacute;s Chr&eacute;tiennes se font fond&eacute;es, form&eacute;es, d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es, au milieu de populations Orientales, S&eacute;mites, Phrygiens, Egyptiens&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_211"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>."</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_134"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 134</FONT></A></P>
<P>This is perfectly true, but it was not only the influence of <I>milieu</I>, not only the fact that the 'hellenized' faiths were, as Cumont points out, more advanced, richer in ideas and sentiments, more pregnant, more poignant, than the more strictly 'classic' faiths, but they possessed, in common with Christianity, certain distinctive features lacking in these latter.</P>
<P>If we were asked to define the special characteristic of the central Christian rite, should we not state it as being a Sacred meal of Communion in which the worshipper, not merely symbolically, but actually, partakes of, and becomes one with, his God, receiving thereby the assurance of eternal life? (<I>The Body of Our Lord Jesus Christ preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life</I>.)</P>
<P>But it is precisely this conception which is lacking in the Greek Mysteries, and that inevitably, as Rohde points out: "The Eleusinian Mysteries in common with all Greek religion, differentiated clearly between gods and men, <I>eins ist der Menschen, ein andres der G&ouml;tter-Geschlecht</I>--&#7955;&#0957; &#7936;&#0957;&#0948;&#0961;&#8182;&#0957;&#0044; &#7955;&#0957; &#0952;&#0949;&#8182;&#0957; &#0947;&#0941;&#0957;&#0959;&#0962;." The attainment of union with the god, by way of ecstasy, as in other Mystery cults, is foreign to the Eleusinian idea. As Cumont puts it "The Greco-Roman deities rejoice in the perpetual calm and youth of Olympus, the Eastern deities die to live again&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_212"></A><A HREF="#fn_212"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>." In other words Greek religion lacks the Sacramental idea.</P>
<P>Thus even if we set aside the absence of a parallel between the ritual of the Greek Mysteries and the <I>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</I> of the Grail stories, Eleusis would be unable to offer us those essential elements which would have rendered possible a translation of the incidents of those stories into terms of high Christian symbolism. Yet we cannot refrain from the conclusion that there was something in the legend that not merely rendered possible, but actually invited, such a translation.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_135"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 135</FONT></A></P>
<P>If we thus dismiss, as fruitless for our investigation, the most famous representative of the Hellenic Mysteries proper, how does the question stand with regard to those faiths to which Cumont is referring, the hellenized cults of Asia Minor?</P>
<P>Here the evidence, not merely of the existence of Mysteries, but of their widespread popularity, and permeating influence, is overwhelming; the difficulty is not so much to prove our case, as to select and co-ordinate the evidence germane to our enquiry.</P>
<P>Regarding the question as a whole it is undoubtedly true that, as Anrich remarks, "the extent of the literature devoted to the Mysteries stands in no relation whatever (<I>gar keinem Verh&auml;ltniss</I>) to the importance in reality attached to them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_213"></A><A HREF="#fn_213"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>." Later in the same connection, after quoting Clement of Alexandria's dictum "Geheime Dinge wie die Gottheit, werden der Rede anvertraut, nicht der Schrift," he adds, "<I>Schriftliche Fixierung ist schon beinahe Entweihung</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_214"></A><A HREF="#fn_214"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>." A just remark which it would be well if certain critics who make a virtue of refusing to accept as evidence anything short of a direct and positive literary statement would bear in mind. There are certain lines of research in which, as Bishop Butler long since emphasized, probability must be our guide.</P>
<P>Fortunately, however, so far as our present research is concerned, we have more than probability to rely upon; not only did these Nature Cults with which we are dealing express themselves in Mystery terms, but as regards these special Mysteries we possess clear and definite information, and we know, moreover, that in the Western world they were, of all the Mystery faiths, the most widely spread, and the most influential.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_138"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 138</FONT></A></P>
<P>As Sir J. G. Frazer has before now pointed out, there are parallel and over-lapping forms of this cult, the name of the god, and certain details of the ritual, may differ in different countries, but whether he hails from Babylon, Phrygia, or Phoenicia, whether he be called Tammuz, Attis, or Adonis, the main lines of the story are fixed, and invariable. Always he is young and beautiful, always the beloved of a great goddess; always he is the victim of a tragic and untimely death, a death which entails bitter loss and misfortune upon a mourning world, and which, for the salvation of that world, is followed by a resurrection. Death and Resurrection, mourning and rejoicing, present themselves in sharp antithesis in each and all of the forms.</P>
<P>We know the god best as Adonis, for it was under that name that, though not originally Greek, he became known to the Greek world, was adopted by them with ardour, carried by them to Alexandria, where his feast assumed the character of a State solemnity; under that name his story has been enshrined in Art, and as Adonis he is loved and lamented to this day. The Adonis ritual may be held to be the classic form of the cult.</P>
<P>But in Rome, the centre of Western civilization, it was otherwise: there it was the Phrygian god who was in possession; the dominating position held by the cult of Attis and the <I>Magna Mater</I>, and the profound influence exercised by that cult over better known, but subsequently introduced, forms of worship, have not, so far, been sufficiently realized.</P>
<P>The first of the Oriental cults to gain a footing in the Imperial city, the worship of the <I>Magna Mater</I> of Pessinonte was, for a time, rigidly confined within the limits of her sanctuary. The orgiastic ritual of the priests of Kybele made at first little appeal to the more disciplined temperament of the Roman population. By degrees, however, it won its</P>
<P><A NAME="page_137"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 137</FONT></A></P>
<P>way, and by the reign of Claudius had become so popular that the emperor instituted public feasts in honour of Kybele and Attis, feasts which were celebrated at the Spring solstice, March 15th-27th&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_215"></A><A HREF="#fn_215"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</P>
<P>As the public feast increased in popularity, so did the Mystery feast, of which the initiated alone were privileged to partake, acquire a symbolic significance: the foods partaken of became "un aliment de vie spirituelle, et doivent soutenir dans les &eacute;preuves de la vie l'initi&eacute;." Philosophers boldly utilized the framework of the Attis cult as the vehicle for imparting their own doctrines, "Lorsque le N&egrave;oplatonisme triomphera la fable Phrygienne deviendra le moule traditionnel dans lequel des ex&eacute;g&egrave;tes subtils verseront hardiment leurs sp&eacute;culations philosophiques sur les forces cr&eacute;atrices f&eacute;condantes, principes de toutes les formes mat&eacute;rielles, et sur la d&eacute;livrance de l'&acirc;me divine plong&eacute;e dans la corruption de ce monde terrestre&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_216"></A><A HREF="#fn_216"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>."</P>
<P>Certain of the Gnostic sects, both pre- and post-Christian, appear to have been enthusiastic participants in the Attis mysteries&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_217"></A><A HREF="#fn_217"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; Hepding, in his <I>Attis</I> study, goes so far as to refer to Bishop Aberkios, to whose enigmatic epitaph our attention was directed in the last chapter, as "<I>der Attis-Preister</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_218"></A><A HREF="#fn_218"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>."</P>
<P>Another element aided in the diffusion of the ritual. Of all the Oriental cults which journeyed Westward under the aegis of Rome none was so deeply rooted or so widely spread as the originally Persian cult of Mithra--the popular religion of the Roman legionary. But between the cults of Mithra and of Attis there was a close and intimate alliance. In parts of Asia Minor the Persian god had early taken over features of the Phrygian deity. "Aussit&ocirc;t que nous pouvons constater la pr&eacute;sence du culte Persique en Italie</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_138"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 138</FONT></A></P>
<P>nous le trouvons &eacute;troitement uni &agrave; celui de la Grande M&eacute;re de Pessinonte&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_219"></A><A HREF="#fn_219"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>." The union between Mithra and the goddess An&acirc;hita was held to be the equivalent of that subsisting between the two great Phrygian deities Attis-Kybele. The most ancient Mithreum known, that at Ostia, was attached to the Metroon, the temple of Kybele. At Saalburg the ruins of the two temples are but a few steps apart. "L'on a tout lieu de croire que le culte du dieu Iranien et celui de la d&eacute;esse Phrygienne v&eacute;curent en communion intime sur toute l'&eacute;tendue de l'Empire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_220"></A><A HREF="#fn_220"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>."</P>
<P>A proof of the close union of the two cults is afforded by the mystic rite of the Taurobolium, which was practised by both, and which, in the West, at least, seems to have passed from the temples of the Mithra to those of the <I>Magna Mater</I>. At the same time Cumont remarks that the actual rite seems to have been practised in Asia from a great antiquity, before Mithraism had attributed to it a spiritual significance. It is thus possible that the rite had earlier formed a part of the Attis initiation, and had been temporarily disused&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_221"></A><A HREF="#fn_221"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</P>
<P>We shall see that the union of the Mithra-Attis cults becomes of distinct importance when we examine, (<I>a</I>) the spiritual significance of these rituals, and their elements of affinity with Christianity, (<I>b</I>) their possible diffusion in the British Isles.</P>
<P>But now what do we know of the actual details of the Attis mysteries? The first and most important point was a Mystic Meal, at which the food partaken of was served in the sacred vessels, the tympanum, and the cymbals. The formula of an Attis initiate was "<I>I have eaten from the tympanum, I have drunk from the cymbals</I>." As I have remarked above, the food thus partaken of was a Food of Life--"<I>Die Attis-Diener</I>&nbsp;</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_139"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 139</FONT></A></P>
<I><P>in der Tat eine magische Speise des Lebens aus ihren Kult-Ger&auml;ten zu essen meinten</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>."</P>
<P>Dieterich in his interesting study entitled <I>Eine Mithras-liturgie</I> refers to this meal as the centre of the whole religious action.</P>
<P>Further, in some mysterious manner, the fate of the initiate was connected with, and dependent upon, the death and resurrection of the god. The Christian writer Firmicius Maternus, at one time himself an initiate, has left an account of the ceremony, without, however, specifying whether the deity in question was Attis or Adonis--as Dieterich remarks "Was er erz&auml;hlt kann sich auf Attis-gemeinden, und auf Adonis-gemeinden beziehen."</P>
<P>This is what he says: "<I>Nocte quadam simulacrum in lectica supinum ponitur, et per numeros digestis fletibus plangitur: deinde cum se ficta lamentatione satiaverint lumen infertur: tunc a sacerdote omnium qui flebant fauces unguentur, quibus perunctis sacerdos hoc lento murmure susurrit</I>:</P><DIR>

</DIR>

<P>on which Dieterich remarks: "Das Heil der Mysten h&auml;ngt an der Rettung des Gottes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_223"></A><A HREF="#fn_223"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>."</P>
<P>Hepding holds that in some cases there was an actual burial, and awakening with the god to a new life&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_224"></A><A HREF="#fn_224"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. In any case it is clear that the successful issue of the test of initiation was dependent upon the resurrection and revival of the god.</P>
<P>Now is it not clear that we have here a close parallel with the Grail romances? In each case we have a common, and mystic, meal, in which the food partaken of stands in close connection with the holy vessels. In the Attis feast the</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_140"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 140</FONT></A></P>
<P>initiates actually ate and drank from these vessels; in the romances the Grail community never actually eat from the Grail itself, but the food is, in some mysterious and unexplained manner, supplied by it. In both cases it is a <I>Lebens-Speise</I>, a Food of Life. This point is especially insisted upon in the <I>Parzival</I>, where the Grail community never become any older than they were on the day they first beheld the Talisman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_225"></A><A HREF="#fn_225"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. In the Attis initiation the proof that the candidate has successfully passed the test is afforded by the revival of the god--in the Grail romances the proof lies in the healing of the Fisher King.</P>
<P>Thus, while deferring for a moment any insistence on the obvious points of parallelism with the Sacrament of the Eucharist, and the possibilities of Spiritual teaching inherent in the ceremonies, necessary links in our chain of argument, we are, I think, entitled to hold that, even when we pass beyond the outward <I>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</I> of the story--the march of incident, the character of the King, his title, his disability, and relation to his land and folk--to the inner and deeper significance of the tale, the Nature Cults still remain reliable guides; it is their inner, their esoteric, ritual which will enable us to bridge the gulf between what appears at first sight the wholly irreconcilable elements of Folk-tale and high Spiritual mystery.</P>

Hepding mentions (op. cit. p. 174) among the <I>sacra</I> of the goddess <I>Phrygium ferrum</I>, which he suggests was the knife from which the Archigallus wounded himself on the 'Blood' day. Thus it is possible that the primitive ritual may have contained a knife.</P>
