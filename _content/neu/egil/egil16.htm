<CENTER>CHAPTER XV.<BR>
<BR>
<I>King Harold and Harek.</I><BR>
<BR>
</CENTER>Hildirida's sons had been that winter with king Harold, and in their company twelve men of their own household and neighbours.  The brothers were often talking with the king, and they still spoke in the same way of Thorolf.  Harek asked: 'Didst thou like well, O king, the Finns' tribute which Thorolf sent thee?'<BR>
'I did,' said the king.<BR>
'Then wouldst thou have been surprised,' said he, 'if thou hadst received all that belonged to thee!  But it was far from being so; Thorolf kept for himself the larger share.  He sent thee three bearskins, but I know for certain that he kept back thirty that were by right thine; and I guess it was the same with other things.  This will prove true, O king, that, if thou put the stewardship into the hand of myself and my brother, we shall bring thee more wealth.'<BR>
And to all that they said about Thorolf their comrades bore witness, wherefore the king was exceeding angry.<BR>
