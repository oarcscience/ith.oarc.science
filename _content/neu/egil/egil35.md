CHAPTER XXXIV.  
  
*Of Skallagrim and Bjorn.*  
  

        It befell in autumn, when ships had come to Iceland from Norway,
that this report came over, how Bjorn had run away with Thora without
the consent of her kin, and for that the king had made him an outlaw
from Norway. But when Skallagrim got to know this, he called Bjorn to
him, and asked how it had been with his marriage; had it been made with
the consent of his wife's kin.  
        'I never looked for this,' said he, 'in a son of Brynjolf, that
I should not know the truth from him.'  
        Bjorn answered, 'Truth only told I to you, Grim, and you may not
rebuke me for this, though I told you no further than you asked. But now
I must own this, which is true, that you have heard truth about this
match not being made with the agreement of Thorir, my wife's brother.'  
        Then spake Skallagrim in great wrath, 'How dared you come to
meet me? Did you not know what friendship was between me and Thorir?'  
        Bjorn answered, 'I knew that between you two was
foster-brotherhood and close friendship; but I sought your home because
I was driven ashore here, and I knew it would avail naught to shun you.
Now will it be for you to rule what my lot shall be, but I hope for good
from you as I am of your household.'  
        Then came forward Thorolf Skallagrim's son, and added many a
word, and begged his father not to lay this to Bjorn's charge after once
receiving him. Several others spoke to the same end. And so it came that
Skallagrim was appeased, and said that Thorolf should have his way
here.  
        'Take you Bjorn,' said he, 'and deal with him as may best prove
your manhood.'
