CHAPTER XLI.  
  
*Of Bjorn.*  
  

        Bjorn got for his portion another good and valuable homestead.
He did not become a liege-man of the king, wherefore he was called Bjorn
Yeoman. He was right wealthy, and a great man. No sooner did Thorolf
come off the sea then he went at once to Bjorn, and brought him Asgerdr
his daughter. There was a joyful meeting. Asgerdr was a most beautiful
and accomplished woman, wise and right skilful.  
        Thorolf went to see king Eric. And when they met, Thorolf
greeted Eric from Skallagrim, and said that he had thankfully received
the king's gift. He then brought out a good long-ship's sail, which he
said Skallagrim had sent to the king. King Eric received the gift well,
and bade Thorolf be with him for the winter. For this Thorolf thanked
the king, but said: 'I must first go to Thorir; with him I have an
urgent errand.'  
        Then Thorolf went to Thorir, as he had said, and met there a
right hearty welcome. Thorir bade him be with him. This Thorolf said he
would accept; 'and there is,' said he, 'one with me who must have
lodging where I am; he is my brother, and he has never before been away
from home, and he needs that I look after him.'  
        Thorir said that Thorolf had every right, if he would, to bring
more men with him thither. 'Your brother, too,' said he, 'we think,
betters our company if he be at all like you.'  
        Then Thorolf went to his ship, and had it drawn up and made
snug, whereafter he and Egil went to lord Thorir. Thorir had a son named
Arinbjorn, who was somewhat older than Egil. Arinbjorn early showed
himself a manly fellow and a doughty. With Arinbjorn Egil struck up a
friendship, and was ever his follower. But between the brothers was
rather a coolness.
