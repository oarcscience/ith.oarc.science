Things to beware of in 1997:

Sudden outbreaks of hostility, racial and otherwise, which seem to 
just as suddenly be quelled.  Some may notice a fine drizzlelike
mist preceding these events.

Subj: Message from CSETI/Greer

FYI and distribution as you see fit.

Steven M. Greer M.D.
Director of CSETITHS
                RELATED TO THE UFO/EXTRATERRESTRIAL SUBJECT

                    copyright 1996 Steven M. Greer M.D.

 A number of first hand military, intelligence and government-
associated witnesses to covert projects dealing with UFOs and
Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI)  have been identified by CSETI's
Project Starlight effort.   Over the past three years, we have located
several dozen such potential witnesses as part of a comprehensive
strategy to collect adequate evidence for a global, definitive
disclosure on this subject.  The story which these important
government witnesses can tell will make a credible, undeniable
case for the reality of UFOs and the existence of extraterrestrial life
forms in proximity to the earth.

One of the persistent obstacles to this testimony  coming out into
the public arena has been the issue of so-called national security
oaths and restrictions placed on these witnesses.  Some feel that
they are not free to speak unless 'released' from these national
security oaths and restrictions, and  so we have been working to
encourage Congress and the White House to take actions which
would remove these restrictions.

In the summer of 1995, a number of these witnesses gathered at a
witnesses summit, and we all signed a letter to President Clinton
asking him to take actions leading to the release of these
restrictions.  While receipt of this letter was acknowledged by a
special assistant to the President, we still await specific action from
the executive branch of the US government.

With this said, it is important to visit the question of whether or
not such national security oaths and restrictions are themselves
legally valid.

We have compelling witness testimony that the operations dealing
with this subject currently exist,  and have existed for several
decades, outside of normal governmental projects.  Members of the
Project Starlight Team have met with very senior members of the
Administration, Congress, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the CIA and
other relevant government agency operatives. The picture which
emerges from these discussions is that of an operation dealing with
UFOs which is functioning outside of the normal channels of
government, as it is usually considered. Indeed, we have found that
the most senior levels of the executive branch,  Congress, the
military etc. are totally out of the loop on this extraordinary matter.

This then brings up the sobering question of who is in the loop,
and under what authorization are such projects operating? It is our
assessment that for the large part, these operations do not fall under
any constitutionally sanctioned avenues of authorization, and as
such are, perforce, illegal.

Aside from the lack of oversight and authorization from the
executive branch and Congress, these operations have, from time
to time, engaged in deceptive practices which have frustrated the
organs of constitutionally legal inquiries and democratic processes.
Any such operation which behaves in this fashion unilaterally
removes itself from the inherent legality and protection which
exists for  projects which are consonant with constitutional law.

This being the case (we are eager - nay, desperate- for someone to
prove otherwise...) all of the so-called 'national security oaths' and
other 'restrictions' placed on military, intelligence and government
contract workers are null and void.  That is, they appear to have no
legal validity since the operations for which they were obtained are
themselves illegal.  In a constitutional democracy, it is a basic
requirement of law that such operations be constitutionally legal,
and if they are not, then all that flows from them - including such
'oaths'- are illegal and therefore non-binding. IF these operations
are legal, nobody  in the Congress, executive branch or senior
military with whom we have spoken knows of it. The production
of a single current executive order or congressional directive
authorizing these projects, which can be independently verified,
would convince us otherwise.

More than one covert contact has told us that, indeed, any such
witnesses can and should speak out at the right time and place
since no legal entity would - or legally could - do anything about
it.   We agree.

Beyond this, it is the legal, moral and patriotic duty of such
witnesses to come together, and at the highest, best and most
credible venue possible, speak out in unison regarding the truth on
this matter.   Granted, if only one or two such persons come
forward, the case will be weak, and the risk will be unacceptable.
But if ten, twenty or more such witnesses come together, and
united, resolve to share their information and experiences on this
subject, then a definitive case will be made , and a great service to
the world  and their country will be fulfilled.

The return of this matter to the legal channels of government and
the deliberation of the people is one of the great unfulfilled tasks
of the post cold war era. Over half a decade has elapsed since the
end of the cold war, and there can no longer be a justification (if
there ever was) for this type of extraordinary secrecy and covert
agenda.  Both national and world security requires that this matter
be returned to the world community as soon as possible.

We recommend that men and women of vision, courage and
dedication join with us in fulfilling this task. Far from being a legal
violation of 'security oaths', the public testimony by such witnesses
is a highly moral and legal act. Further, is it not true that the
continuation of this secrecy itself is illegal and immoral, given the
inherent unconstitutionality of such programs? Credible witnesses,
joining together and providing their testimony in a united strategy
can return this  subject to legal oversight and control, and thereby
enable the people of our country and of the world to begin the
public deliberations which should have occurred 50 years ago.
