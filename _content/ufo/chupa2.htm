Subject:  Have You Hugged Your Chupacabras Lately?      May 20, 1996.
Part 2.

  In previous stories I've read about the Chupacabras it has been
said that they were able to kill guinea fowl  or guinea hens.  I have
attempted to hunt this birds as a youngster and they are really hard
to get close to.  They are a barnyard fowl, having grayish blue
feathers with white dots.  Originally imported from Guinea, a region
of the N. African coast.
  Here we go with part 2.

  2.  The small wounds may be similar in appearance to bites
inflicted by dogs or "baboons,"  due to their being round and small,
but all similarity ends there.  The government officers and
veterinarians willing to follow the official  "explanations" given by
them, do not give the real details pertaining to the wounds.  They
forget to inform us, conveniently, that whatever enters the animal's
body has a length of about, at least, three to four inches long.. and
in some occasions seems to cauterize the walls of the wound,
apparently to prevent excessive blood loss.  No known animal species
on Earth can do this.  Some of the wounds of this type appear also on
the sides and bellies of the victims, and they usually penetrate
into the animal, cutting through the stomach, continuing down to the
liver, affecting it and taking parts of it, as well as "absorbing"
liquids from it.  This requires a length of at least 3, 4 or five
inches, as has been verified on the animals.  Also, the already
mentioned triangular pattern of wounds has been observed going into
the body and penetrating the liver of the victims.

  3.  Even though "something" intrudes and penetrates into the
animals, creating extensive trauma and injuries in them, also leaving
strange materials in the tissues, no natural inflammatory processes
have been observed in the dead animals tissues.  This is totally
unnatural.

  4.  In most cases the victims lack rigor mortis, and remain
flexible, even for days after their death.  Also, incredibly, in
several of these cases, the blood still remaining in the dead
animals wouldn't clot or coagulate,  This weird detail lasts for
days too.

  5.  Several bigger holes or cuts are found on the victims body.
These consist of holes that range from an inch in diameter up to 12
inches.  These openings are usually located in the neck, chest, belly
and anal area of the animals killed, and look as if made with a
surgeon's scalpel.  Clean cut openings are found through which organs
are excised from the bodies.  The organs tend to be the liver, the
reproductive and sexual organs, the anus, eyes and other soft
tissues.

  As for the other official "explanation," that mentioned the
possibility of someone involved with religious or satanic sects who
may be doing the killings, the number of cases is too numerous for
this to be the explanation behind it all.  These killings are
happening everyday, at all hours, all over the island, and no single
sect has the resources needed to finance such an operative.  There is
only one sector in Puerto Rico that can afford these actions, the
government, but what reasons would the government have to do this?

                       The Creature Observed

  Most of the killings are attributed to strange creatures we have
called an Anomalous Biological Entities {ABE's}.  It looks like a
cross between a "grey alien humanoid {because of the shape of its
head and eyes} and what most witnesses describe as "the body of a
biped, erect dinosaur, but with no tail."  Its head is oval in shape,
with an elongated jaw.  It has two big elongated red eyes, small
holes for a nostril and a small slit-like mouth with fangs
protruding upwards and downwards from it.  Some witnesses mention it
has small pointy ears, but most have stated it has none.  It has a
strong, coarse hair all over its body.  This hair is black, but this
creature has the ability to change colors at will, like a chameleon.
If it is in the dark it changes to a dark color, black or dark brown.
If in a sunlit area with vegetation, it changes to green, green-gray,
light brown or beige.

  The creature has two small arms with three fingered-clawed hands
and two strong hind legs with three claws, which enable it to run at
a fast speed and to leap over trees and over more than 20 ft. in a
single bound.  According to witnesses, the creature's legs look
reptilian or goatlike.  Also, it has quill-like appendages running
down from its back, with what seem to be fleshy membranes that change
colors from blue to green, to red to purple, etcetera.  Some
witnesses have described seeing the creature flap these
quill-membrane-like appendages at an incredible speed, and this
allows it to fly.  Even though it has what seems to be a pair of
membrane-like wings, these are used by the anomalous biological
entity to glide and guide itself while flying.  The creature seldom
flaps these "wings."

JW  All I have to say is, "Land-sakes."
