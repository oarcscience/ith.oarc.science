<p><A NAME="page_122"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 122</FONT></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">CHAPTER III</h3>  <h4 align="center">Back on Mother Mu</h4>  
<p>The great sensitive needles of the ionic-trail-indicator&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_42"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> became still and fell back against the pin marked 'O'&#151;no more trail.</p>  
<p>In the split second that the needle stopped, I leaped to my feet, stabbing the button opening the ship communicator.</p>  
<p>"All hands! Attention! Reverse drivers! View screen open! Gun crews stand by!"</p>  
<p>The great dreadnor braked to a tortured halt from full velocity. I could hear Tyron taking over control, alerting the crew for battle&#151;action that might start immediately. Barked orders maneuvered the ship's immense bulk into the exact center of the "zone of weightlessness".</p>  
<p>"&#151;we might have to move fast."</p>  
<p>"Where are we?" I asked myself, as soon as I had made sure that the enemy wasn't in the neighborhood.</p>  
<p>"This constellation looks familiar," I mused. "Can it be . . . still . . . it is!"</p>  
<p>Opening the communicator, I called, "Arl! Do you recognize that planet in your view screen? It's Mu!" Nostalgia gripped me. A homesickness I didn't think I</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_123"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 123</FONT></A></p>  
<p>could still feel smothered me at the sight of the familiar seas and green, white-topped mountains of my abandoned homeland of almost two thousand years ago.</p>  
<p>Taking over the controls from the pilot who didn't even suspect that the planet under us was my former home, I tooled the mighty Darkome to a landing on Mu's satellite. For all of her tremendous mass, she slid gently to a stop in the glistening, liquid-air snow sheltered by the black shadow of one of the moon's mountains.</p>  
<p>I ordered the tender broken out, then called to the control room.</p>  
<p>"I am going to take Lady Arl to the surface of this satellite's planet. While I am scouting down there, keep the crew alerted."</p>  
<p>Tyron saluted, looking a bit envious&#151;envy, I guess, at the thought that he wasn't going to see his desired action. "Yes, sir," was all he said.</p>  
<p>"Observe standard precautions for operation in enemy territory. Avoid using equipment as much as possible to cut down the chances for detection."</p>  
<p>"Yes, sir," he nodded.</p>  
<p>"I don't know where the Sathanas&#146; ship or ships have gone, but I doubt if they would be apt to be close by and still be undetected by our mech. But, until you hear from me, take no chances. That's an order!"</p>  
<p>Returning his salute, the Lady Arl, who had come to the control room, and I boarded the tender and took off. And not too comfortably, either. A tender is a small spacer for short flights&#151;lifeboats for the crew, and on the Darkome the tenders were big, but two thousand years of Vanue's wizardy of growth had increased our height till we were well over fifty feet.</p>  
<p>Both Arl and I felt the old excitement we'd experienced as youths using the small spacers for picnics from Mu to the Moon&#151;felt excitement as I drove the little craft to the surface of the doomed planet for the first visit in a score</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_124"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 124</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of centuries.</p>  
<p>Our excitement soon turned to sadness. This wasn't the same planet we'd left&#151;no darting ships&#151;no shining towers&#151;no signs of civilized life.</p>  
<p>"Oh, Mion," spoke the lovely Arl beside me, "this is all so sad and unreal. I feel like&#151;Mion! Look! What's that over there?"</p>  
<p>"It looks like . . . it is a city, Arl!" Her enthusiasm was contagious. "Shall we go over there?"</p>  
<p>"Oh, yes, Mion. Let's see what man has done in all these years."</p>  
<p>"All right, Arl, but remember we are not allowed to stay here long."</p>  
<p>She nodded, silent.</p>  
<p>We of the Nor are not allowed to stay long on a sunlit planet, for one's character soon becomes twisted&#151;not necessarily into evil, but certainly into err&#151;which can be worse. One in err is stupidly convinced of his correctness, of his own brilliance. All of our food and drink must be brought from our ship, for the radioactives in the water and meat of Earth may not be eaten by Nor men by law. That err, that mental polarization, is the thing men of Earth must fight most fiercely, for err will live in their thinking, an illogic that will make them think black is white till they are forced to check the question with a colorimeter.</p>  
<p>We would pay for my stay on this sad planet with many boring hours before the medicos finish the mental tests to make sure that we have not been seriously affected by the sun's hard light. Sometimes I believed they feared evil and its cause too much to fight it effectively. The old medicos can be tiresome themselves, to the point of evil. I would like to give some of them a few tests myself&#151;of my own devising. Yes! They are too close to some dense metals&#151;err magnets of another kind&#151;and have become polarized by the dullest and heaviest metal to be found on a thousand master-size planets, that I know.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_125"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 125</FONT></A></p>  
<p>I expected to stay but the few hours allowed me and then away. Nearly two thousand years of the destructive magnetic field sweep of the sun had passed over old Mu. The difference between this little planet third from the Sun and the dark planets is immense. There, time is a growth, never a loss. Here, time is a sorrow, a slow destruction, a completely OPPOSITE QUANTITY. Here, the proud towers of Old Atlantis are crumbling stones, eroded by the blowing sands of the encroaching deserts that did not exist under Atlan science. There, the fecund growth of man has multiplied the beauty and pleasure, the power and the glory of Nor, many, many times in these two thousand years.</p>  
<p>Having seen death in many forms, I like to fight death's burning face wherever I find it. Surely, death's face is burning brighter on Mother Mu than on any other globe these feet have trod, feet that sink further into the dis-softened stones&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> of this planet than any other I know. Many have been the globes trod since I last left old Mu to voyage through the dark voids where no light but the light of wisdom can be found. Dull it is, to one who has tasted war and death, and swift-tiding battles, to speed on some mission in which the element of danger has been reduced to the undetectable minimum. I am a warrior, trained through many centuries of supremely difficult schooling to the rigors of battle and war, and there are few indeed, for Nor men to fight who even dare to think of braving our slightest displeasure.</p>  
<p>Nearly two thousand years had passed since I distributed the records of the Atlan migration to dark space to guide the men who should come after us on Mu.</p>  
<p>As I guided the craft in a hovering flight over the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_126"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 126</FONT></A></p>  
<p>scarred face of old Mu, I marveled at the green growth over everything, for it is hard to realize that though everything dies of the Sun poisons, life goes on, renewed forever. After first coming upon such worlds of death, one cannot accustom oneself to the idea that all this life that looks so vibrant and virile is so short-lived.</p>  
<p>I know that since I had left Mu, cities probably had grown and died upon her surface, and cities under her surface must have been peopled and have again lost their peoples in the wars that always rage on the sun-burned planets.</p>  
<p>Arl and I glided over the glittering golden roofs of the city, and, settling to Earth some miles distant, entered a cavern whose ancient shafts still gaped, unfilled by the rubble that now choked most of the openings to the Elder world. We were anxious to see what life had taken root within the caverns, for there lay the tools of the ancient wisdom, waiting for a wise man-child's learning. Arl opened the great air lock at the bottom of the shaft and I floated the tender in to the floor of the cavern.</p>  
<p>We fell to rummaging about in the ruins of the great mansions, as one will in these old places. I activated one of the penetray view rays and took a look at the shining city on the surface not far away. A one man flyer of an antique make rose from the city and came toward us. I augmented the passengers' mind, saw that his name was Tyr, that he was of the Aesir, as the people of the city evidently called themselves. He had seen our ship and was coming to investigate. He seemed excited, as though something about our appearance had revealed to him that we were the uncommon "visitors from the stars" mentioned in the legends and folk-tales of his people.</p>  
<p>"Arl," I called to my lovely lady who was busy satisfying her curiosity about some of the old mechanisms at the far wall of this big room. "Arl, come here and watch this flier&#151;he seems to be heading this way!"</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_127"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 127</FONT></A></p>  
<p>With the quick, cat-like change of interest of women, Arl pranced gaily over to where I sat at the controls of the tele-thought augmentor. With a pleased little laugh, she wagged that ever-charming tail of hers and took her place beside me.</p>  
<p>As we sat at the screen watching the approaching flier, we could see his mind was a maelstrom of conflicting sentiments&#151;I couldn't repress my laughter at the fear I saw there. But there are times when Arl saves me from unrequired cruelty, and when I laughed, she chided me.</p>  
<p>"Oh Mion, don't laugh at that poor little man! Remember, it has been almost twenty centuries since they have had a visit from any of the Elder Races."</p>  
<p>"Lovely Arl," I agreed, "I had forgotten. I should have remembered that fear goes with sun-infection."</p>  
<p>"He is a brave man, Mion," Arl pointed out. "He is afraid, yet his will to investigate makes him overcome his fear. If he is representative of mankind . . .</p>  
<p>I nodded, knowing what Arl meant. As long as there are brave men on Earth who can conquer their fear and dread with their own wills, there is hope that mankind can, in time, defeat the "de" curse of the Sun.</p>  
<p>"Look, Mion, he's dropping down the shaft as though he has done it many times before."</p>  
<p>It was true. The pilot of the little flier expertly dropped down the shaft and came to rest beside the Darkome's tender. There was a moment of indecision&#151;Arl and I knew from reading his mind that it was all he could do to restrain a wild, nearly uncontrollable impulse to flee. He took heart, however, stepped from his machine, and came toward us. He was large for the race of Earthmen, being about twelve feet high.</p>  
<p>Finally, eyes bulging, he stood in awe before us where we sat at the ancient mech.</p>  
<p>I greeted him by name: "Ho, Tyr, what brings you to us who are strangers to you?"</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_128"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 128</FONT></A></p>  
<p>At that he flung himself prostrate before us. Our lack of enmity loosed his tongue and he protested: "Of course you know me, O Gods from the Stars. I have heard the old men speak of your kind, and have read something of you in the ancient writings, but many of us no longer believe in the greater Gods. Of course, you understand all mysteries, and you have read my thoughts over the ancient mechanisms I see you toying with. I am of the Aesir race, and that is our city you see in the distance. I am one of the few who understand the great significance of your coming here. Odin, our all-father, in his palace invites your presence. We have great need of your wisdom, Mighty Ones."</p>  
<p>I finally assented to Tyr's importuning and the invitation of Odin himself over the great ray called Odin's Eye, and we entered the tender and took off for the palace of Gladsheim&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_44"></A><A HREF="#fn_44"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> dominating the shining, gilded-roofed city of Asgard in the distance.</p>  
<p>We spiralled down toward the great courtyard of the palace, reading a dozen minds on my telaug on the way down.</p>  
<p>It is habitual for a Nor to be careful. There was nothing but curiosity and awe in their minds; this was no trap, I knew. As I landed the ship, several brawny, armored warriors came up to us. Axes were slung on their belts beside the antique dis-ray pistols, pistols of a type that the science of the high gods has not surpassed to this day. They spoke the ancient universal tongue called Mantong, but time had so changed the pronunciation that it was difficult to understand it at once. We used small portable</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_129"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 129</FONT></A></p>  
<p>telaugs to tell what was in the minds about us anyway. We easily carried them in our hands. But Arl and I soon began fully to understand the speech, for the basic sounds were all the same as our own, and not by any means are we mentally slow.</p>  
<p>To our way of thinking, these Aesir were little fellows. They were not more than ten or twelve feet in height. The largest showed the graying hair of age, the sign dreaded most of all plagues, in all space, caused from over exposure to the poisonous emanations of a deadly Sun. In space flight, sometimes it happens that some poorly plotted course flashes a ship close into the terrible heat and deadly particles of the field surrounding some dense sun. Also, sometimes, in the little time of their passing such a sun at light speed, their hair grows white, and they die in a few weeks. Such is impregnation by radio-active particles&#151;sure death. Old Sol, the Earth's sun, is not that bad, but it, too, is sure death. A great pity arose in me that these fine men did not know what caused their age, or how to avoid it if they did know. This pity of mine is one reason some man will sometime find this record I leave, and know how to shun the terrible plague of space, the deadly, dense particles from heavy suns that get into the flesh and stay, burning away good life force and leaving a shrivelled corpse.</p>  
<p>Do you remember the lovely Arl? She is still Arl, but grown so big now that the Mutan who loved her then would worship at her feet as once he worshipped at Vanue's huge beauty . . . for that matter I still do anyway. She is here beside me now, toying with the ancient stim rays; the stim ray that is forbidden as its effects can be most evil if the metal is too far gone in slow disintegrance. But Arl carries with her a meter of my devising containing a dial which reveals the most minute flows of "de" force dangerous to man.</p>  
<p>She must know if this one is dangerous stim or not. It seems to be still usable, for a vastly pleasurable viray is</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_130"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 130</FONT></A></p>  
<p>flowing over my form even now from her hands, and her soft lips are multiplied a laughing million of times all over me. I am forever startled by the endlessly varied stim augments that Arl's infinite wit finds in any mech of the kind. I have had a billion tiny Arls lift me in my sleep and carry me to Elysia, their forms growing more and more about me, till all the world was soft, gleaming, rosy Arl, the flowers her faces, the breeze from her lips, and the stim rays looks from her eyes, loving me, while her hair became a vast forest of titanic, curling beauty sheltering me in its scented shade.</p>  
<p>There are no words or images to tell you what a girl of imagination can do with stim augments of her thought. I still think of Arl as a girl, and she looks like a girl, too, except her size is as great as my own, and that is too much to think about. For soon we must leave our loved home on Nor and move on to the heavier planets&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#fn_45"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> of the Elder cities, and that is a hard time for adjustment, as it takes years to accustom oneself to the great gravity.</p>
