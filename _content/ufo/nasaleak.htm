Things to beware of in 1997:

Gradual acclimation of the public to the idea of 'extraterrestrial
life', possibly in the form of us somehow being martian progeny, all
for dubious political ends.

Rich Boylan originally posted the information from Dr. Bergrun, which was
obtained from a radio interview, and I posted it to other newsgroups to find
out if anyone could provide any additional information. William Wilson was
able to obtain the following information:

Science News reported on 02-03-96 (V 149, No.5 p.71) that several objects
in Saturns orbit has been viewed by the Hubble telescope on May 22 and
August 10, 1996.
"From Hubble images taken during the Aug. 10 crossing, Phillip D.
Nicholson of Cornell University and his colleagues detected two never seen
before bodies as well as S3. The team has concluded that none is a moon.
Nicholson says the objects must have been created during the last 14
years, because they are too big and bright for the Voyager craft to have
overlooked them during the Saturn flybys in the early 1980's. In addition,
the brightest of the three bodies is elongated, unlike a satellite. All
three objects seem to have disapperared by Nov. 21......"

Recall the first reference to this elongate "space craft" was seen by
Voyager imaging according to Dr. Bergrun, a retired NASA scientist
interviewed on a recent radio talk show in Greenville South Carolina on
January 30, 1996. I called Dr. Bergrun concerning this statement and his
book and he verified the the facts that were revealled on the interview.

This is a very significant revelation from two different sources
completely separated from each other. I find this a facinating
correlation.

No moon or discovered object has ever "disappered" in the history of
astronomy that was the size described by Dr. Bergrun and images discovered
by the Earth orbiting Hubble telescope. This should be a starting point
for a lot hard questions put to NASA.
