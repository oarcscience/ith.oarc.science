                             Dallas Area UFO Sightings

       In the past  two days there have been reports of UFO's in the Dallas
       Forth Worth, metroplex area. The  sightings  were  even  reported on
       WFAA radio.

       The first sighting was on November 12, 1990 at 10:40 pm and was seen
       by several people. They had described the object as  round  with red
       and blue lights. The object was stationary for several minutes.

       The object was  in  the  south  east  area.  As  referenced from the
       downtown Dallas area.

       On November 14, 1990 at 2:30 am, there  were  again reports of a UFO
       in the Dallas area. This would be just east of Dallas. This was also
       reported to the radio station WFAA. One caller stated  that  he  had
       watched the object through his 8x power rifle scope.

       The caller stated,  "that  the  object had travelled very slowly and
                           that it had a delta wing shape appearance."

       ------------------------------------------------------------------- 
       Vangard Note...

            It is quite probable that these sightings were not of a UFO.

            The first sighting on November 12 was on a night  that was very
            clear outside, the temperature was very cool, in the high 40's.
            And it was an excellent night for star gazing.

            Also that  evening weather reporters had commented "that it was
            an excellent night for people to watch the stars".

            Atmospheric refraction  is especially  notable  on  cold  clear
            nights.  When  warm upper air intermixes with  lower  cold  air
            (remember heat  rises),  we  have  a  definite twinkling and/or
            magnification of the brighter stars.

            We have witnessed how quite competent people can be "entrained"
            to believe that there is something moving up there.

            A ray gun, communicator or some  physical  evidence would still
            be the best evidence.









            The second  sighting on November 14, is a good possibility that
            the people were seeing an F-117A flying area.

            These aircraft can fly at very  low  speeds and they don't make
            as much  noise  as regular jet aircraft do. The  F-117A's  have
            flown out of the Fort Worth air base for the past year.
