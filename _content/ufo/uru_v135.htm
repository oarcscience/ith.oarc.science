Many UFO sightings have taken place in the midwestern United
States during the past week.  But the big flap is in Brazil!

CROWD PANICS IN PARAIBA

     On Wednesday night, October 16, 1996, a gigantic rectangular
UFO appeared over the city of Joao Pessoa (population 498,000)
in northern Brazil, causing over 300 residents to flee in panic.
Joao Pessoa is the capital of Paraiba, a small state in the Sertao
(Northeast) on Brazil's South Atlantic coast.
     The OVNI (Portuguese acronym for UFO) flew at an estimated
altitude of 3,000 meters (11,000 feet).  Witnesses described it as
an object "as long as a twenty-story building (72 meters or 240 feet)."
Late-night diners on the Avenida Rui Carneiro and the Rua Almeida
Barretto had a clear view of the rectangular UFO, which was also
seen in ten other cities of Paraiba, including Patos, 176 kilometers
(110 miles) west of Joao Pessoa.  (See the Brazilian newspaper
O Norte for October 17, 1996 "Discos Voadores Chagam A Capital,"
page 1.)
     The following night, Thursday, October 17, "um gigantesco OVNI
triangular" (gigantic triangular UFO) was seen in Campina Grande
(population 326,200), the state's second largest city, 120 kilometers
(75 miles) west of Joao Pessoa.  The UFO flew slowly over the city on
a westerly course.  People dining in the 11th floor restaurant of the
Rique Palace Hotel, Avenida Venancio Neiva 287, watched as the
UFO drifted over midtown.
     Also that night, in Joao Pessoa, people saw  UFOs flying in
formation over the city.  They made three passes over the city and
were described as "colored balls green on the outside with flashing
yellow lights."  One eyewitness, Prof. Jacipa Lucena de Farias, 45,
watched the sky show from the Rua Indio Piragibe.  She said she
counted 11 UFOs during the second pass over the city and 30
UFOs on the third pass.  The UFO formation was also seen by
passengers waiting to board intercity buses at the Transportadora
Wilson.
     In the small town of Jaguaribe, local residents saw 40 "green
light" UFOs skim overhead at about 11 p.m.
     The flap went into high gear Friday night, October 18, with the
reappearance of a gigantic cylindrical UFO over Guarabira.
This inland city, north of Campina Grande, has been repeatedly
visited by UFOs since April.  According to Wellington Francisco de
Lima, president of Equipe Pesquinas Ufologicas de Guarabira (UFO
Investigating Team of Guarabira), EPUG for short, Friday's UFO was
"a cylindrical object very much like a flourescent lamp.  It moved by
itself both vertically and horizontally.  The object emitted a strong
light but it did not move at great velocity."
     A large UFO was also seen that night in the Parque Arruda
Camara and at Praia de Jacare beach in Joao Pessoa.
     In the rural village of Pilozinhas, Sra. Julia Monteiro de Cabral,
age 92, said "an unusual silver plane" landed at 6:45 p.m. that
Friday, coming down vertically beside some eucalyptus trees.
Emerging from the UFO were a group of occupants she described
as "homem pequenos e feios" (little fantastic men).  Speaking a
high-pitched unintelligible language, the occupants surrounded
Sra. Monteiro de Cabral's small house, and, she added, "They
stole some of my chickens."
     In Sao Neves, residents saw "two OVNIs 30 meters (100 feet)
in diameter of a discoidal (saucer) shape with blinking lights."
     And in Mamanguape, 90 kilometers (55 miles) from Joao
Pessoa, a local man was reported missing after two "bright
balls of light" were seen in the night sky.
(Thanks to EPUG members Wellington Francisco de Lima,
Marcus Sila, Andre Santos Geisa, Pedro Alves and Oriel Farias
for these reports.)

MANY CLOSE ENCOUNTERS IN OHIO

     On Tuesday, October 15, 1996, just past 11 p.m., a man driving
between Kenton and Bellefontaine on Ohio Highway 68 spied a
triangular UFO in the sky.  The UFO was three miles (5 kilometers)
north of Bellefontaine and described as "a bright red light centered
between two white lights...an additional white light was close by,
which made a triangle shape...The red light was centered in the
triangular pattern and detached from the main object."  The witness
had it in view for five minutes before the light "extinguished."  At
11:30 p.m., he phoned the group Tri-States Advocates for Scientific
Knowledge.  Both T.A.S.K. and the Hardin County Sheriff's
Department investigated the incident.
     Four separate UFO incidents took place the following night,
October 16.  At 8:30 p.m., a couple on Flaugher Hill Road in
Aberdeen, Ohio, a town on the Ohio River 48 miles (77 kilometers)
southeast of Cincinnati, saw "an orange light" to their immediate
north.  The UFO "appeared, then disappeared, then reappeared in a
different part of the sky.  I'd never seen anything like it in my life,"
the man said, adding that his wife was "near hysteria."  He phoned
both the Brown County Sheriff's Department and the Ohio State
Highway Patrol.  Police dispatchers, however, deny that any UFO
calls were received that night.
     At 8:37 p.m., another couple saw "a bright orangish red" UFO
"appear and disappear...in the direction of Manchester" (population
2,400), another Ohio River town 12 miles east of Aberdeen.  The
husband phoned a friend in Bethel (population 2,231), forty miles
(64 kilometers) to the northwest, who looked outdoors and saw
"three or four lights moving in a straight line, and two or three
lights in a diagonal line, forming a T shape."
     At 8:45 p.m., in rural Ross County outside of Chillicothe
(population 23,240), a city 64 miles (102 kilometers) northeast
of Manchester, residents spotted "appearing and disappearing
lights."  One man videotaped "an object with lights rotating around
it in a circle."  Radio station WKKJ 93.3 FM in Chillicothe drew
several calls from listeners describing the UFOs.  The UFO tape
was broadcast on TV Channel 10 in Columbus, Ohio the next
day, October 17.
     In Jackson, Ohio (population 6,675), located 31 miles
(50 kilometers) southeast of Chillicothe, a resident reported
seeing "a bright red fireball traversing the sky just after dark
(6 p.m.) heading west."
     On Thursday, October 17, at 11 p.m., Melissa M., 22, of
Lima, Ohio was outdoors walking her dog.  The canine needed to
answer a call of nature.  All at once, she saw "a bright light
moving from the south."  At first glance, Melissa thought it was a
medical emergency helicopter but changed her mind when "the
light went over me at high speed without making any noise."
Minutes later, three military jets roared over her head.  "They were
so low I could see the red of their afterburners."  (Email Interview)
    Melissa's hometown of Lima (population 43,400) is 75 miles
(120 kilometers) north of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and
37 miles (59 kilometers) northwest of Bellefontaine.

UFO reports)

TWO NEW UFO SIGHTINGS IN MINNESOTA

     On Thursday, October 17, Jack Kelliher, who lives near
Wausau, Wisconsin, was driving on Highway 61 just outside
Red Wing, Minnesota, a town on the Mississippi River 57 miles
(91 kilometers) southeast of Minneapolis, when he saw a domed
saucer or daylight disc hovering in the sky.
     "I couldn't believe my eyes," Kelliher said, "but I think I
actually saw a flying disc motionless in the sky, reflecting
sunlight, almost as if they were watching me.  At first I thought
it was a reflection, so I got out of my car.  And it was still
there.  The object had a straight flat bottom.  It domed-out on
the top.  It might have been a reflection, but I seriously doubt it.
Basically, it looked like a peripheral view of a cookie.  It sat there
for a good ten seconds, as I ran up to the fence post to double
check to see if it was a reflection.  But by the time I got to the
fence, it was gone.  I don't think it was a reflection.  The object
appeared truly metallic."  (Email Interview)
     The following day, Friday, October 18, at 7:50 p.m., Maureen
Nickerson was driving on Interstate Highway 94, just west of
Fergus Falls, near the North Dakota state line, when she spied
something unusual in the sky.  "It appeared to be a medium-
sized pulsating star.  As I watched it, it began to move, but
keeping pace with me, then speeding up.  It crossed the highway
in front of me, then stopped and hovered by the side of the road.
I could see distinctly green and red spot-light lights at the top.
They were moving around, not just stationary.  I could see no
structure at all, just the lights.  There was one main large white
circular light and the red and green lights at the top.  While it was
hovering, it appeared to flip upside down.  The (colored) lights
appeared at the bottom.  I had my videocam along and could have
gotten it on video except it didn't seem safe to stop.  The craft
meandered slowly over the countryside until it disappeared from
my view on the horizon."  (Email Interview)
(Editor's Note:  Pamplona, Spain has the running of the bulls.
But, every summer, Fergus Falls has the running of the geese,
also known as the Fergus Falls Goose Gallop.  It's lots of fun,
so if you happen to be in Otter Tail County, drop on in.)

DAYLIGHT DISC APPEARS OVER APPLETON, WISCONSIN

     Sunday, October 20, 1996, at 3 p.m., found Dan Jensen and
his wife driving south on Wisconsin Highway 41 just outside
the city of Appleton (population 59,032).  "As we were driving,"
Jensen recalls, "we happened to look to the southwest and saw
a very shiny object.  From the horizon there was blue sky, then
a cloud bank, then more blue sky.  This object was in the center
of (below) the cloud bank.  I thought it was an airplane with the
sun glaring off the body.  But below the shining or gleaming object
and to our right was an airplane.  You could see the shape of the
plane and that it only showed glare off the top of it.  The other
object's whole body glowed brilliantly and had the distinct (saucer)
shape of a UFO.  It seemed to be somewhat larger than the plane
even though it was farther away.  It was visible for about two
minutes, then disappeared into the clouds.  As we were passing
others on the highway, we saw at least two other drivers looking
in that direction.  We would like to know if anyone else saw it."
(Email Interview)

CIGAR-SHAPED UFO SEEN NEAR CHICAGO

     Mrs. Pamela McIlvaine of Illinois reports a sighting from July 3.
On that day, Mrs. M and her grown son were driving out of Chicago,
heading to Maryland on vacation, when they spotted an unusual
object in the sky.  It was 12:30 p.m., Mrs. M recalls, and her son
"pointed toward the sky and told me to look...My first impression
was that it was a 'flying wing' but, of course, there was nothing
attached to it. It was bluer than the sky, metallic, but not
especially shiny, not reflecting the sun which was very bright.
The object remained stationary for a few minutes, then appeared
to turn at a 90-degree angle and disappear away from us.  We
were driving south, so it was also headed south.  I am very much
interested to know if anyone else saw this object."  (Email
Interview)

UFO SEEN OFF AUSTRALIA'S "SUNSHINE COAST"

     On Thursday, October 17, at 6:50 p.m., Glennys Mackay,
director of Queensland MUFON, her husband, and two American
ufologists, John Carpenter and Joseph Lewis, were driving on
the Bruce Highway in Queensland, near Caloundra and Noosa,
55 kilometers (33 miles) north of Brisbane.  Suddenly, according
to Ms. Mackay, the quartet "noticed a huge light rising up out of
the sea, which was stationary for some time before dropping
rapidly into the ocean once again.  After several minutes, it
surfaced and was once again in the southeast sky."  The four
studied the UFO "through telescopic lenses and found it to have
four white lights.  The very interesting thing about this was that
it showed itself (to be) a round silver ball surrounded by a light
which appeared to be a silver mesh in appearance.  After several
minutes, it took off in a northerly direction."  As it flew away, the
UFO appeared to be "large and long with a huge bright light in
front and several white lights behind."

Updates for this report.)

BIG WEEK FOR UFOs IN BRITAIN

     Early Friday morning, October 18, 1996, Alexander Klement,
age 8, of Penrhyn Avenue, Walthamstow, East London awoke
suddenly when he heard his six-year-old sister cry out in her
sleep, "calling for her mum."  Then he heard a tish-tish-tish
sound coming from the garden behind their home.  Turning in bed,
Alex looked out the window and saw "a big orange triangle in the
air just hanging there."
     According to John Klement, his father, an East London
barrister (lawyer), Alex said the UFO "was a bit rectangular at the
bottom with three lights in it, the two outer ones green and the
middle one orange.  There was a light glow round about."  The
tish-tish noise stopped, and the lights flashed on and off
alternately, then stopped again.  Then, according to Alex, "the
triangle turned over on its side and flew off" noiselessly.
(See the Waltham Forest Independent for October 18. 1996,
"Orange Triangle Hovered Over Garden.")
     In Morecambe, Lancashire, a port on the Irish Sea, the local
UFO study group videotaped an unidentified flying object last
week.  The UFO was flying over Torrisholme, a village just outside
of Morecambe.  The group described it as triangular, "the size of
three Hercules transport planes and totally noiseless."  When last
seen, the UFO was flying south, down the peninsula, seemingly
headed for the Heysham nuclear power station.  (Thanks to Errol
Bruce-Knapp and UFO Updates for this story)
(Editor's Comment:  Headed for the Heysham nuclear power station,
eh?  I'm sure that was REALLY comforting news to the eight million
people living in nearby Liverpool and Manchester!)

UFO PARADE NEAR BOULDER DAM

     At 11 p.m. on Saturday, October 19, 1996, Nelson Deane and
some friends from Boulder City, Nevada parked on a desert rimrock
ridge 23 miles south of gigantic Hoover Dam on the Colorado River.
The group saw "multiple formations of UFOs, all kinds, delta,
box, T-shaped.  Single crafts kept appearing and disappearing,
traveling faster than the rest of the group and flying from formation
to formation."  They watched the UFO formations until 3 a.m. on
Sunday, October 20, when "crafts resembling meteors" showed
up.  "They'd fly a short distance, disappear, and then reappear
and start the cycle again.  Anyone else see this show?"

UFO AIMS A SPOTLIGHT AT A CAR IN QUEBEC

     On Tuesday, October 15, 1996, at 11 p.m., Yves Anger of
Montreal and his girlfriend were driving west on Highway 40 near
Trois Rivieres, Quebec (population 52,508) when Yves spotted
"three unknown objects in the northern sky."  The condition of the
sky was clear, he reported, and the UFOs "were triangular in form,
very big" and had "a variation of green, blue, red and yellow lights
blinking."  One of the objects then aimed "a terrible light" at their
car and kept them bathed in its incandescence for "at least 20
minutes."  The three UFOs were seen by 60 other witnesses.
(See the newspaper Journal de Montreal for October 18, 1996.)
