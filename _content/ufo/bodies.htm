This should provide a wealth of autopsy evidence on ET body structure and
workings when accumulated in any one place.  ETs coming from UFOs have strange
properties, a report:  THE UFO CRASH/RETRIEVAL SYNDROME (STATUS REPORT II:
NEW SOURCES, NEW DATA) by Leonard H. Stringfield is published by MUTUAL UFO
NETWORK INC., 103 Oldtowne Road, Sequin Texas 78155.  It has a January 1980
copyright date.  The report interviews severl medical doctors who did autopsies

on ET bodies from UFO crash sites.  ET had large heads and were around 4 ft.
tall.  They have small noses and mouths with no ears or hair.  The ET photo
that I have was taken by an ET and has an eye diameter of an inch.  He has his
left hand raised in a salute.  That hand has 4 fingers on it with one finger
twice as long as either outside finger.  The photo was taken at a range of 3 ft

from the waist up.  Brain capacity is 1800 cc versus 1300cc for the average
human.  The skin is grey or ashen and under the microscope appears meshlike.
This meshlike appearance gives it the reptilian texture of granular skinned
lizards like iguana or chameleon.  There was a colorless liguid in the body
without red cells, no lymphocytes, no hemoglobin.  There was no digestive
system, intestinal, alimentary canl, or rectal area in the ET autopsy.



Note:  I got this off of the InterNet from the World Wide Times Area.  I'm not
sure who put this report together.

... Will the real alien, please stand up?
