<p>George Hunt Williamson <A NAME="img_ghw"></A>
<TABLE  ALIGN="RIGHT"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="img/ghw.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT"></TD></TR></TABLE> served with the Army Air Corps during World War II as Radio Director for the Army Air Forces Technical Training Command.

He served as an instructor in Anthropology for the United States Armed Forces Institute, and was later appointed Lieutenant in the U. S. Infantry.</p>  
<p>He attended Cornell College, Eastern New Mexico University, the University of Arizona, and took a special course at the University of Denver. He majored in anthropology with many courses in sociology, biology, philosophy and geology.</p>  
<p>In 1948 he was awarded the coveted Gold Key for outstanding scientific research by the Illinois State Archaeological Society. He has spent a great deal of time doing field-work in Social Anthropology in the northern part of the United States, Mexico and Canada. He is an authority on Indian dances, music and ceremonial costuming. Several of his articles have appeared in scientific journals.</p>  
<p>He is listed in the July, 1952 Supplement to "Who's Who In America", and his name appears in the latest editions of "Who Knows, And What", and "Who's Who in the West". He is included in Volume Twenty-Nine of "Who's Who In America", and also in "American. Men of Science".</p>  
<p>He is co-author of <i>The Saucers Speak!</i> (A Documentary Report Of Interstellar Communication By Radiotelegraphy).</p>  
<p>Mrs. Williamson, the former Betty Jane Hettler, is a chemist and an anthropologist, holding an A.S. degree from Grand Rapids Junior College; a B.S. degree from Eastern New Mexico University; and a B.A. degree from the University of Arizona. Both are members of the American Anthropological Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">FRONT FLAP TEXT</h3>  
<p>In more recent times, there has been a growing realization that on other worlds than ours, even in other universes, there are other living beings. The idea that earthbound man may someday journey into the heavens to discover other men and women, like or unlike himself, "grows by leaps and bounds. Within man's soul lies the truth--mortals exist on other spheres!</p>  
<p>Here is a book that brings home this tremendous fact with a dynamic force and sweep that will astound the reader, and convince him beyond all doubt. Here is a <i>history</i>, a collection of <i>proof</i>, and a tremendous <i>theory</i>.</p>  
<p>While man in his heart knows that other worlds are also inhabited, he is reluctant to admit that Earth is only one small house of the "many mansions" in the Father's house. But the truth stares him in he face, and now, having arrived at a place in his civilization where only Truth will be able to survive, it has become necessary to reaffirm</p>

<p>and establish three truths, namely: 1) Science and religion are one and the same thing; 2) The entire universe is magnetic in nature, and even culture is influenced by the laws of magnetism; 3) Space visitors, mentioned in the Bible and ancient mythology, have been coining to Earth throughout the ages, and are now making themselves known to aid mankind in entering a New Age.</p>  
<p>In this book, many references and quotations are given from the latest authentic reports on Saucer phenomena. Because many believe there are contradictions in some of the reported happenings, it has been necessary to show that there is a great story and purpose behind all these experiences.</p>  
<p>Here, in this book, is the history of <i>other tongues</i>, and of <i>other flesh</i>; calm, scientific evidence that there are brothers of ours in the skies overhead.</p>  
<p>We are not alone in the Universe!</p>
