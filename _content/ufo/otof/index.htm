George Hunt Williamson was a pioneering UFO researcher who developed
many of the themes of modern UFOology.
Williamson invented the concept of 'walk-ins,' who he called 'The Wanderers.'
Walk-ins are normal humans who are actually (unknown to themselves)
reincarnated 'Space Brothers.'
Williamson also worked with George Adamski, another UFO pioneer.
One of the centerpieces of this book is a labored interpretation
of symbols in footprints left when Venusians had a close encounter with Adamski
in the California desert.
</P>
<P>
Williamson has a somewhat opaque and very inflated resume.
While his official bibliography lists numerous academic credentials and
honors, Williamson actually dropped out of college,
purchased some of his degrees from a diploma mill and invented the rest.
He also claims to be an expert on Southwestern
Native Americans, which is strange, because I've never seen
any papers by him on that topic.
Despite the attempt to reinvent himself as a <I>bona fide</I> scientist,
Williamson repeatedly disparages the scientific method in this book,
calling scientists 'The Guessers.'
</P>
<P>
Even murkier is his association with the Nazi William Dudley Pelley,
whom he worked for briefly in the early 1950s.
That said, it is difficult to spot any explicit trace of extreme right-wing
politics in this book.
Williamson believed that most of the aliens visiting Earth look like
humans (or <I>are</I> humans), are benign, and preach a telepathic message of
peace and brotherhood.
In this book at least, the amoral, almond-eyed 'grey'
aliens who conduct hostile abduction of humans
for medical experimentation and mutilate livestock
are nowhere to be found.
