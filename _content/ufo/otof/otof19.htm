<p>The book you have just read and the thoughts contained therein are but a "pale shadow" of things to come. Time is running out, but there will be no "end", there will only be a "beginning". Terrestrial Man seems incapable at this moment of making "One World", but he will soon face the more profound challenge to create "One City of the Universe".</p>  
<p>Man will go on into ever expanding <A HREF="errata.htm#55">grandeur</A>; for even when the whole celestial Universe has been mapped, studied and charted, there will be Universes beyond to tempt human imagination.</p>  
<p>In all great adventures of ideas the only prayer which we can address to God is: "Grant us patience." And, "Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near." (Isaiah 55:6).</p>  
<p>"So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. For ye shall go out with joy, and led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands." (Isaiah 55:11-12).</p>  
<p>Remember the words of the Master in St. Mark 13:37: "And what I say unto you I say unto all, <i>Watch!</i>"</p>
