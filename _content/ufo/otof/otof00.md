northern part of the United States, Mexico and Canada. He is an
authority on Indian dances, music and ceremonial costuming. Several of
his articles have appeared in scientific journals.

He is listed in the July, 1952 Supplement to "Who's Who In America", and
his name appears in the latest editions of "Who Knows, And What", and
"Who's Who in the West". He is included in Volume Twenty-Nine of "Who's

### FRONT FLAP TEXT

In more recent times, there has been a growing realization that on other
worlds than ours, even in other universes, there are other living
beings. The idea that earthbound man may someday journey into the
heavens to discover other men and women, like or unlike himself, "grows
by leaps and bounds. Within man's soul lies the truth--mortals exist on
other spheres!

Here is a book that brings home this tremendous fact with a dynamic
force and sweep that will astound the reader, and convince him beyond
all doubt. Here is a *history*, a collection of *proof*, and a
tremendous *theory*.

While man in his heart knows that other worlds are also inhabited, he is
reluctant to admit that Earth is only one small house of the "many
mansions" in the Father's house. But the truth stares him in he face,
and now, having arrived at a place in his civilization where only Truth
will be able to survive, it has become necessary to reaffirm

### BACK FLAP TEXT

(*Continued from front flap*)

and establish three truths, namely: 1) Science and religion are one and
the same thing; 2) The entire universe is magnetic in nature, and even
culture is influenced by the laws of magnetism; 3) Space visitors,
mentioned in the Bible and ancient mythology, have been coining to Earth
throughout the ages, and are now making themselves known to aid mankind
in entering a New Age.

In this book, many references and quotations are given from the latest
authentic reports on Saucer phenomena. Because many believe there are
contradictions in some of the reported happenings, it has been necessary
to show that there is a great story and purpose behind all these
experiences.

Here, in this book, is the history of *other tongues*, and of *other
flesh*; calm, scientific evidence that there are brothers of ours in the
skies overhead.

We are not alone in the Universe!
