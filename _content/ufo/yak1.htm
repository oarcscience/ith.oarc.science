FORWARD

     The Yakima UFO Field project was undertaken by me in August of
1972 at the request of Dr. J. Allen Hynek.  The study has
continued to this day.

     The original reports were not widely circulated by Dr. Hynek
at my request.  However, a number of articles and at least one book
related to the Toppenish Study have been published over the years.
This electronic distribution is my attempt to make the original
documents of the study available to anyone who is interested.

     This distribution contains the text of three papers:  The first
was submitted in November of 1972.  Two follow-up reports, in 1974
and 1975, summarize developments and report statistics following
the conclusion of the initial field study.  The original
typewritten documents were scanned and converted to electronic media
files with OCR software.  Otherwise, they appear essentially as they
did in their original form.

     December of 1995 marks twenty-three years since the Toppenish
Field Study was undertaken.  Bill Vogel and Allen Hynek have died.
Many of the other people who contributed to it have moved on to new
jobs, retired or died.  This publication is dedicated to Bill Vogel
and others who helped to bring the Yakima manifestation to our
attention.

INTRODUCTION

     This report presents findings made during a field study period
extending from August 20, 1972 to August 31, 1972, near Toppenish,
Washington U.S.A.

     It is intended as a preliminary report, since investigation is
still in progress.  The report begins with a description of the
study area.  The following section presents a short history of UFO
activity in the region.  The next section deals with the objectives
of the study, the investigative approach employed and instruments
used.  Detailed reports of each observation of apparent UFO
activity made by this investigator comprise the fourth section of
the report.

     The final section of this report includes some preliminary
assessments concerning the effectiveness of the study and some
suggestions for improving equipment for present and future
investigations.  Care has been taken to report all unusual
observations as accurately as possible and to refrain from
analysis.

     Appendix A summarizes additional observations by other
individuals during the year of 1972, prior to the initiation of the
field study described in this report.


DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY AREA

     The area involved in this study consists of a rectangular
section, about forty miles wide and seventy miles long (2,800 sq.
miles), located in south central Washington state.  Almost all of
the area is a part of the reservation of the Yakima Indian Nation.
Approximately two-thirds of the reservation is closed to the public
and special authorization is required to enter the area.

     Eastern borders of the study area are marked by the towns of
Parker, Wapato, Toppenish, Granger and Mabton.  The western border
is formed by the eastern slopes of the Cascade mountain Range, with
Mount Adams (elevation 12,307 ft.) the dominating feature of the
skyline.  The northern border of the area is marked by Ahtanum
Ridge (4,5OO ft.).  Bickleton Ridge and the Simcoe Mountains (max.
elevation 5,500 ft.) from the southern border.  Figure I is a map
of the study area.

     The eastern quarter (144,325 acres) of the region is used for
agricultural purposes; the principal crops being sugar beets, hops,
mint, asparagus, corn, peas, grain, alfalfa, cherries, peaches,
apples and grapes.  This quarter is flat valley farmland.  The
remaining portion of the eastern half or the valley is used for
rangeland and consists mainly of dry, rolling hills.

     The western half of the study area is made up of heavily
forested terrain, much of it primitive and inaccessible to normal
ground transportation.  Timber from this region is a major source
of income for the area.  Railroad tracks of the Burlington Northern
Line run along the eastern border of the reservation.  U.S. Highway
97 is the only major freeway in the area and, along with primary
power transmission lines of the Bonneville Power Administration,
cuts through the southeastern corner of the reservation.

     Secondary roads, many of them dirt or gravel, crisscross the
reservation.  The town of White Swan, twenty miles due west of
Toppenish, is the most western population center in the area and
has about 300 inhabitants.  The closest areas of industrial
significance are the nuclear research facilities at Hanford, 28
statute miles to the northeast, and the Yakima Firing Range, 14
statute miles to the north of Toppenish.

     Geology of the study area is interesting:  Marine fossils
found in the area indicate that the entire valley might once have
been a huge lake or inland sea.  Volcanic activity is still very
much in evidence, especially in the vicinities of Mt. Adams and
neighboring Mt. Rainier.


HISTORY OF UFO PHENOMENA IN THE STUDY AREA

     Activity recognizable as classical UFO phenomena has been
present in the Toppenish area for more than eight years.  There is
even some evidence to suggest that UFO reports are a part of Yakima
Indian legends.  A detectable increase in activity has taken place
in the last three years.  Reports have recently been made by law
enforcement personnel from the Washington Stare Patrol, County
Sheriff and reservation Law and Order department.  Formerly, fire
lookouts had been the primary source of reports.  A majority of
observations are made at night and consist mostly of the typical
"nocturnal light" (NL) phenomenon described by Hynek(1).  Primary
characteristics of this particular phenomenon include:
          1.  Generally bright light, larger than a point source.

          2.  Colors reported cover the entire spectrum, but most
               usually are yellow-orange.

          3.  Kinematics are not attributable to balloons,
              aircraft or other natural objects and often give
              the appearance of intelligent action.

     The NL in the Toppenish study area have generally conformed to
the above description.  The Toppenish manifestation does seem to
differ slightly in that it is frequently observed on or near the
ground.  Predominant colors range from brownish-orange to pure
white.  Investigation of prior NL activity in the study area
revealed that a few daytime observations have been made.  These
daylight sightings are very rare and have ranged from "fuzzy"
appearing "blobs" to well-defined, metallic colored,
disk shaped objects of the classical "flying saucer" variety.
There was also one ten year old report of a physical impression
made in the ground by an UFO.


DESCRIPTION OF STUDY OBJECTIVES AND METHODS

     Preparations for the Toppenish project began in April of 1972,
following a survey of the extent of activity in the area by Dr. J.
A. Hynek.  It was determined at this time that the activity was of
sufficient quality and regularity to justify placement of an
observer equipped with instruments in the area during a period of
expected peak activity.  The Yakima Tribal council and the Yakima
Agency, Bureau of Indian Affairs, along with the Agency Forestry
Division gave their full cooperation to the project and plans were
made to conduct a field study during the month of August (a period
of prior high sighting probability).

     A primary objective of the study was to determine the
feasibility of "staking-out" a scientific observer in an area of
high sighting probability, with the purpose in mind of obtaining
hard data concerning UFO phenomena.

     First priority was assigned to obtaining photographs,
including spectrographs and position data.  It was felt that this
information would be of greatest use as scientific information and
the easiest to acquire, given the transient nature of the
phenomenon under study.  Another priority was the acquisition of
data relating to any magnetic effects which might arise from UFO
activity.

     The investigative approach used involved setting-up portable
observation points at selected locations in the study area for
several days at a time.  This technique allowed the observer to
become acquainted with normal activity in a given location and
prepare him to detect any abnormal activity which might occur.  No
concerted effort was made to "chase" the phenomenon around the
reservation.  Instead, it was allowed to come to the observer.  The
temporary observation points and instruments were manned during the
times of greatest sighting probability, i.e., between sunset and
sunrise.

     Additional time, during the day, was spent gathering
background data, such as previous sighting reports, geographical
and other supportive information.  Accent was placed on flexibility
of method, because of the large area to be covered and the
elusiveness of the phenomenon under investigation.  The
investigator's presence was purposely made as unobtrusive as
possible to avoid interference with routine business on the
reservation.

     Observation points were established at six points in the study
area.  Three of these locations were adjacent to Satus, Signal Peak
and Sopelia fire lookouts (Slide Nos. l, 2 and 3, respectively).
The remaining observation points were positioned in the valley near
White Swan.  All of the observation points are numbered on the map
of Figure I.  (Satus, Signal Peak and Sopelia lookouts are numbered
5, 4 and 6, respectively.)

     The Tribal Forestry Division radio system was available for
communication between the investigator and fire lookouts.  It was
intended that such a communication link might provide a means of
triangulating the position of a NL, should a sighting occur.  All
transmissions were coded because of previous reports of apparent NL
responses to radio messages concerning them.  When Possible, radio
transmissions were avoided to keep from disturbing personnel who
monitor the 110 unit radio network on a twenty-four hour basis
during the fire season.

     All observation points were accessible by means of roads.
However, a sturdy car was required to traverse them.  The fire
lookout locations afforded  excellent visibility to the
investigator and were free from  interfering lights.  Valley
observation points were often subject to interfering lights and
haze, but afforded the best views of ridges where much of the NL
activity had been previously reported.

     The instruments used included two single lens reflex (SLR)
cameras, a 16mm motion picture camera, a 35mm range finder camera,
a compass spin detector, recording magnetometer, standard time
receiver and tape recorder.  Other instruments for measuring
nuclear radiation, infrared radiation, ultrasonic sound and
frequency references were available, but not normally deployed.

     One of the SLR cameras was fitted with a 500mm, f8
catadioptric design lens.  This camera/lens combination had a 5
degree field of view and served as the primary instrument for recording
visible light data (Slide No. 4).

     The motion picture camera was normally fitted with an 18-86mm,
f2.7 zoom lens, but could be operated with the same 500mm lens used
on the still camera. The second SLR camera was equipped with a 55mm
lens and replica grating to permit recording of spectral data.
(Slide No. 5, right).  These three cameras used Kodak High speed
Ektachrome, Type B (EFB) film.

     EFB film was selected because of its high exposure index, good
resolution characteristics and reasonable exposure latitude.  It
was also found that the "B" emulsion gave the best color balance
under night exposure conditions.

     The range finder camera (Slide No. 5, left) was loaded with
black and white Kodak High Speed infrared film and equipped with a
Wrattan 89B filter.  This camera could record radiation in the
near-infrared spectrum (wavelengths 750 to 900 nanometers).

     The standard time receiver picked-up National Bureau of
standards time signals and served as a time reference for
measurements.  An electronic compass spin detector was also
deployed during the observation periods.  Signals from both devices
were fed into the tape recorder, along with the observer's
commentary.  The latter instruments are shown in a typical field
set-up in Slide No. 6.

     An automatic recording magnetometer, designed and built by the
San Diego section of the Aerial Phenomenon Research Organization
(APRO), was also used during the field study period.  This device
required some initial setup, but afterwards was capable of
unattended operation.  Its primary features were high sensitivity
to changes in magnetic flux, wide frequency response (to 1000 Hz)
and the ability to detect rotational force vectors of possible
paramagnetic nature.


OBSERVATIONS OF NL ACTIVITY MADE DURING THE STUDY PERIOD

     A number of observations of apparent NL activity were made by
this investigator during the field study period.  Many of them were
recorded on film.  This section catalogs the sightings
chronologically.  Slides which are applicable to the particular
observation are referenced by number.  All time is recorded in
Greenwich Mean Time, 24 hour format.  All dates are given at
location.  Headings from observation points are magnetic (add 20
degrees for true headings).

OBSERVATION I
Date: 8-20-72
Observer Location:  Point 1 (Figure I)
Activity Location:  Point A (Figure I)

     One luminous, round light was observed at 0415 on a bearing of
240 degrees  from the observer.  It was joined by another similar
light at 0437.  They were at an elevation of 10-20  and well below
the ridge of the hills.  Their apparent location was north of Hunt
Creek and west of the Job corps camp, at an estimated distance of 19
statute miles.  Topography of the area is rugged, dry hills.

     Sky at the time of the first observation was Partially
overcast in cumulus, with openings to the south and overhead.  The
moon was high in the sky and intermittently visible through the
overcast.  Temperature was about 65 degrees F and surface wind was
from the NW at between 0 and 5 mph during the observation period.

     The two objects were apparently round, with a reddish-orange
glow and no clearly defined outline.  The diffuse glow was evenly
distributed over the surface of each object and no discontinuities
were visible.  The light flickered noticeably, in much the same way
as a flare might look when subjected to a strong wind.  The object
would appear and disappear as if being switched "on" and "off".
Color hue and saturation appeared to remain constant as the light
flickered, but perceived size appeared to change.

     Movement of the objects was erratic and discontinuous.  They
appeared to move independently, circling and changing places in
relation to one another.

     The lights operated below the ridge of the hill at all times
during the observation.  They were last seen at approximately 0510.
Intensities gradually diminished and time between "on" cycles
became longer until they were no longer visible.

     Four slides were obtained during the observation period.  The
camera was stationary during the whole sequence.  Slide Nos. 7-10
were taken at 0437:48, 0438:16, 0439:35 and 0432:46, respectively.
Exposure was ฌ second through the 500mm, f8 lens.  The film (EFB)
was processed for its normal, ASA 125 rating.  Slide No. 11 is an
enlargement of Slide No. 8.  Note the presence of two objects on
this slide.

     The unusual kinematics and physical appearance of these
objects strongly indicates that they did not arise from mundane
causes, such as car or motorcycle lights.


OBSERVATION II
Date : 8-21-72
Observer Location:  Point 2 (Figure I)
Activity Location:  Points B and C (Figure I)

     Equipment was set up in a field west of the intersection of
Wesley and Branch Roads, northwest of White Swan.  This location
was chosen in an attempt to get closer to the activity observed on
the previous night.  At 0405, what appeared to be automobile tail
lights were seen moving on a heading of 20 degrees from the observation
point (Point 8 of Figure I).  No headlights were visible.

     The red lights appeared to be near the base of the hill, at an
estimated distance of 5ซ miles.   (Note: There is a road in this area.)
The tail lights stopped moving and, shortly thereafter, two
luminous, amber "balls" came rapidly down from near the top of
Ahthanum Ridge, circled around each other and approached the red
lights.  All of the lights next went out, suddenly and
simultaneously.  The whole observation lasted less than two minutes
and no sounds were heard.

     At 0512, two "vehicles" with red lights were observed moving
rapidly up and down the hill side, approximately 10 degrees to the
left of the first observation.

     Their distance was again about 5 miles from the observer.
Each "vehicle" had what appeared to be an amber headlight which
swept rapidly back and forth over the ground ahead of its path.
The actual source of the "headlight" was never seen, regardless of
whether the object was going up or down the hill.  Only
the beam cast on the ground by this "headlight" and the red light
were visible.  The objects appeared to move independently of each
other and traversed the distance from near the base of the hill to
the top of the ridge (approximately 900 ft. of elevation), at an
angle of 60 degrees to horizontal in less than ten seconds.

     Again, no sound was heard.  The objects disappeared from view
about ten minutes later.  Weather was almost completely overcast
with cumulus clouds,  Openings in the overcast could be seen to the
northwest and southwest.  A thunderstorm was building to the
southeast.

     Another object appeared on a bearing of 270 degrees at 0619
(Point C on Figure I).  It was a large brownish-orange ball,
apparently positioned above Rattlesnake Ridge.  It might have been
taken for a planet except for the fact that it was under the overcast.
It appeared to flicker slightly and remained stationary.

     The object disappeared in the observer's field of vision, as
if it were a light being turned-off.  Estimated time for this
observation was five minutes.


OBSERVATION III
Date :  8-22-72
Observation Location:  Point 3 (Figure I)
Activity Location:  Point D (Figure I)

     A luminous orange ball, similar to the one observed on 8-20-72
was seen at 0352 on a bearing of 250 degrees from the observation Point,
This object appeared to be stationary and was near the base of the
hill.  It blinked on and off several times.  Slide No. 12 was
taken with a ฌ second exposure through the 500mm, f8 lens.  Again,
EFB film was used and processed for normal ASA.  The top of the
ridge is shown and a mercury vapor street lamp appears at the lower
left of the frame.  The unknown object is to the right.  Slide No.
13 is an enlargement of the mercury vapor light and object.
(Note:  Chromatic aberration in this slide is a result of the copy
process.)

     The light was closer in color to white than orange.  It was
difficult to determine whether the object in this case was a
motorcycle headlamp or "genuine" NL.  The source appears to be too
bright and large for a motorcycle headlamp.


OBSERVATION IV
Date:  8-24-72
Observer Location:  Point 5 (Figure I)  Satus Fire Lookout
Activity Location:  Point E (Figure I) Piscoe Meadow

     At 0510, the investigator and fire lookout spotted one (?)
bright white light moving very rapidly through a wooded area
southeast of Piscoe Meadow (bearing approximately 358 degrees true).
Distance to the sighting area was about 18 miles.

     The light moved so fast that it gave the impression of a
streak.  It would appear stationary for a moment, then, almost
instantaneously, appear some distance away (typically 10 degrees
of arc through 7x50 binoculars).  After another brief pause, it
would dart back in the opposite direction.  When stationary, the
object appeared through the binoculars as an intense pinpoint of
white light.

     The sky was clear and the moon was rising, but there was
considerable haze in the valley.  All car lights observed this
evening had an orange cast.  The observation lasted about one
minute and no photographs were obtained.

     A radio message from an observer in the valley was received at
0730.  He asked the fire lookout if the investigator was "up and
around."  The lookout's reply was affirmative and the transmission
was terminated.

     The following day it was learned that the observer in the
valley had spotted a tan or light orange, slow moving light from
the freeway near the town of Parker (18 miles NE of the lookout).
It moved slowly down the valley to the town of White Swan, turned
and appeared to move directly over the Satus lookout.  It next
turned and headed east, where it disappeared behind Toppenish
Mountain.

     The person in the valley assumed that the observer at the fire
lookout could not have missed the object and he did not want to
make any direct mention of the object over the radio.

     Nothing was seen from the observation point at Satus lookout
before or after the radio message.  There was no reasonable way the
light could have been missed by the investigator and the fire
lookout.  Yet, nothing was seen.  The observer in the valley is
known to be extremely reliable and there is no reason to doubt his
word.  This "non-observation" rates very high on the strangeness
scale.


OBSERVATION V
Date:  8-26-72
Observer Location:  Point 5 (Figure I) Satus Fire Lookout
Activity Location:  Point F (Figure I) near Dry creek

     Intermittent lights were observed along the ridge southeast of
Satus Lookout for much of the night.  They seemed to appear and
disappear at random and were thought to have been lights from cars
or campers.  sky was clear with bright moonlight.  Haze was
moderate in the lower elevations.

     A 2.5 minute time exposure was taken of the area between 0845
and 0847 with the 500mm, f8 lens and EFB film.  Slide No. 14 is the
result.  The two(?) lights appearing on the slide were not seen
during exposure.  Note that the microwave antenna on the relay
station also appears dimly in the left hand foreground of the
picture.  Slide No. 15 is an enlargement of No. 14.

     The closest ridge from the point where the slide was taken is
about 5ซ miles away.  Knowing the distance to the ridge and angle
of view of the lens (5 degree), it should be possible to determine
whether or not the light source was a car.  Further analysis of
this slide is needed.


OBSERVATION VI
Date:  8-31-72
Observer Location:  Point 1 (Figure I)
Activity Location:  Point C (Figure I) At first observation

     A luminous ball, identical in color and kinematics to that
observed on 8-20-72 was seen at 0518 on a bearing of 240 degrees
from the observation point.  The object moved through an arc of
about 10 to 15  in three minutes.  It appeared to follow the hills,
about ll miles away, and was situated vertically about half of the way
between the base and top of Ahtanum Ridge.

     Slide No. 16 is a 60 second time exposure made through the
500mm, f8 lens.  Slide No. 17 is an enlargement of No. 16.  Note
how the object appears to move in "spurts" or flicker (there were
no known obstructions between the object and camera during the
exposure).

     The object was seen briefly again by this investigator at
0739.  It was apparently on or near the side of the hill, directly
below and in line with a microwave tower 8ซ miles due north of the
observation point (Point G).  The object was clearly visible
through binoculars and appeared as a sharply defined,
brownish-orange disc.  It gave the impression of being flat and the
ground near it could be seen illuminated by the glow.  The object
disappeared by "turning-off" before the camera could be trained on
it.  The foregoing observations could not be accounted for in
normal terms.  One additional observer verified the sighting.


SUMMARY

     The primary objective of demonstrating the feasibility of the
"stake-out" technique of UFO field investigation appears to have
been met during the study period.  Nocturnal light activity was
observed and recorded on film.  Unfortunately, the closest activity
was at a distance of about eight miles.

     The long working distance did not permit the acquisition of
any physical data other than a few slides.  However, given the
technical and position data available, it should be possible to
arrive at a reasonable estimate of the size, light output and form
of the objects observed.  It is in this area that primary effort is
needed.

     This investigator is satisfied that genuine NL activity has
been and is still taking place on a more or less regular basis in
the Toppenish area.  However, there was nothing in the nocturnal
light observations made during the study which would suggest
conclusively that the source of the activity is extra terrestrial.
On the other hand, something very unusual is taking place.  The
problem warrants continued very careful and objective examination.

     A few words should be said concerning the measurements -- or
lack of measurements -- made during the study period:  One camera
was responsible for all of the "hard" data obtained,  The only
other camera capable of working at the distances involved was the
16mm camera/500mm lens combination.  It was discovered early,
however, that the motion picture camera could not be aimed
with the very dim light available.  The reason is that the reflex
viewing system in the camera, utilizing a half-silvered prism, did
not transmit enough light to the viewfinder.  (The camera has since
been fitted with an auxiliary viewfinder.)

     All of the NL activity was too far away to permit
spectrograms, because of the relatively short focal length lenses
required by the replica grating.  Additional work is being done on
spectrograph instrumentation which will allow working longer
distances.

     The use of the tape recorder for commentary and time logging
was invaluable in determining the times at which photographs were
made and recalling details of observations.  A great deal of
information would have been lost without the time and recording
equipment.

     There were no abnormal magnetic disturbances sensed by
instruments at any time during the study period.  The compass spin
detector was deployed most of the time during observation periods
and no anomalous compass deflections were sensed.  The recording
magnetometer was used less than the compass spin detector, because
of its extreme sensitivity to normal magnetic disturbances.  The
instrument appears to have potential, however, and a separate
report dealing with the instrument will be forthcoming.

     In conclusion, a great deal in the line of hard, practical
experience has been gained from this study.  It was learned what
things would work - what would not.  Hopefully, the mistakes made
during this initial study period can be avoided in the next.

     At any rate, study of the activity in the Toppenish area will
continue indefinitely until some explanation for the phenomena
there is obtained.

     All material collected during the study period, including the
original slides, is available for inspection by any qualified
investigator.  Questions, suggestions and comments will be
welcomed.

APPENDIX A
SUMMARY OF REPORTS FOR THE PORTION OF 1972 PRIOR TO THE FIELD STUDY


1.   Date: June 7, 1972 -- Between 9:30 and 12:30 am local time
     Activity location: South fork of Toppenish Canyon (7 miles
     from the observer)

     Summary:
        Spherical shaped object going up and down,
        bouncing.  Had a bluish "metal-flake blue") sheen and was at
        least 30 to 40 feet across.  Disappeared with big flash of
        light arcing into air.  Weather was towering cumulus with 7%
        cloud cover.  Wind from SW at  5 mph (2:00 pm reading).
        Visibility was 12 miles.  Cloud-to-cloud lightning observed
        after 2 pm.  Note: Pet dog reacted strangely, as if its ears
        were hurting, for approximately one hour on the evening
        following the observation.  Nothing was visible on the latter
        occasion.


2.   Date: June 29, 1972 -- 10:20 pm local time
     Activity location: Red Butte

     Summary:
        Object sat for about 10 minutes.  "Kind of pear-
        shaped" with fairly  sharp outline.  About four minutes before
        it moved, yellow, red and green lights were observed.  The
        object was sitting motionless and then shot straight up to a
        high altitude.  Object next shot straight east.  Sharp angular
        motion and very high speed.  Weather was clear, with variable
        westerly wind.  Visibility was 17 miles.


3.   Date: July 31, 1972 -- 9:05 pm local time
     Activity location: South slope of Shinando Canyon

     Summary:
        Baseball sized, very white light floating along just
        below tree top level.  No noise as object moved slowly from
        west to east.  Observer was above the tree tops in the canyon
        and above the object.  Distance to the object was less than
        one-half mile.


4.   Date: August 2, 1972 -- 9:10 pm local time
     Activity location: Yego Pasture

     Summary:
        Big "blob" with no definite shape.  Observed for
        ten minutes before it shot straight up, made an
        instantaneous turn and shot north,  Weather clear, NE wind.
        Humidity 35 and lower, with 15 mile visibility,


5.   Date: August 3, 1972 -- between 10:00 and 11:15 pm
     Activity location:  NE of fire lookout (Satus)

     Summary:
        Big, white, bright "thing", something like a cloud
        came and went.  It would appear dim, then become brighter
        and brighter, and then. "like something melting fast",
        disappear.  Angle of elevation was 300 and object was fairly
        close to lookout.  Bright streaks or rays came from the object
        and lighted up the interior of the lookout, making things
        inside visible,  The sky was dark above and below the object.
        Size of the object was estimated to be as large as the lookout
        (about 12x12x8 feet).  No moon was visible.


6.   Date:  August 11, 1972 -- 12:30 pm local time
     Activity location:  1000 to 2000 feet above observer

     Summary:
        Hemispherical object with multicolored, stippled
        streamers observed below cloud cover.  Observed less than a
        minute and disappeared almost instantaneously into clouds.


7.   Date:  August 15, 1972 -- 11:00 pm
     Activity location:  T9, R19, Sec 22  26' (approximately)

     Summary:
