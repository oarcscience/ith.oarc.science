       If you should  happen to have an encounter with a UFO, the following
       guidelines will provide help.....

             1. Remain calm and don't panic.

             2. Do NOT attempt to approach the craft if it is on the ground
                or hovering at a low altitude.  There  have been many cases
                in which  witnesses have heat and/or radiation  burns  from
                approaching too close to a craft.

             3. Do  NOT  attempt  to  make  contact with any of the craft's
                occupants.  Your intentions  may  be  mistaken as an act of
                hostility.

             4. REPORT  YOUR SIGHTING. By all means report  what  you  have
                seen, but  don't  bother reporting it to the Air Force, the
                FBI, or local Police.  These  organizations  maintain there
                are no UFO's and as such will simply file your report away.

                Instead report your sighting to a UFO organization such as
                CUFON, UFORN,  MUFON,  CAUS, or any of a  dozen  other  UFO
                groups.  Chances are these organizations will send a "field
                investigator" to  personally  sit down with you and discuss
                your sighting.

             5. If possible, take a picture  of  the  craft  with a camera.
                DON'T use a flash.

                A flash  on an ordinary camera is only good  for  about  20
                feet and  all  you  will accomplish is letting the UFO know
                exactly where you are (if it didn't know already.)

             6. Note if possible the exact  time of the sighting. This will
                aid in determining the duration of the sighting.  Also look
                around for  familiar  objects  that you can use to estimate
                the size of the craft.

             7. Notice if possible any  unusual  colors  or  shape  of  the
                craft, did the craft produce any sound and  if  so what was
                it.

             8. Notice if possible any related effects caused by the craft,
                i.e. electrical  malfunctions  of  electronic  devices (car
                ignition, radios, etc).   Look  for  ground effects such as
                dust being blown about beneath the craft.

             9. After the craft has left look for any "Traces."
                A trace  would  be any physical sign the craft  was  there,




                i.e.  flattened grass, unusual soil patterns etc.

                DON'T TOUCH ANY AREA THAT HAS SIGNS OF BEING A TRACE, leave
                that to the UFOlogist.

            10. As  quickly  as possible write down exactly what you saw or
                dictate it into a tape recorder.

                As time passes the memory of exact detail may fade.
