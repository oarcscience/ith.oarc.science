<p align="center">By Dr. Ernest L. Norman</p>  
<p>While our materialistic scientists are still arguing about the possibility of life on Mars, psychics and clairvoyants are seeing remarkable visions of its advanced civilization. Dr. Norman, an electronics engineer and natural clairvoyant reports what he sees. Other clairvoyants have "seen" similar things, but the world was not interested. Clairvoyants, like inventors, are often ahead of their time, but their findings are usually correct. Dr. Norman explains the so-called "canals" on Mars&#151;which are not really canals; brings out details of social and economic life. Beautifully illustrated by a great artist.</p>
