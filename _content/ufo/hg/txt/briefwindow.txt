"During a brief window of time,
some may wish to follow us."

The above statement was part of a press release to be issued to the news media by DO, 
dated 3/22/97. 

When Do said: "During a brief window of time, some may wish to follow us" we don't feel 
this is limited only to former class members and to the best of our knowledge He did not 
assign anyone the task of announcing when that gate was closed. None of us are qualified to 
determine how long this brief window exists.  

When we have our Older Member with us,  we are not assigned tasks by having a little voice 
come into our heads saying  "I think I have this task to do."   We learned very early not 
to trust any thoughts that would come into our heads or listen to little voices telling us 
we should do this or that.  Ti and Do did not ask anyone to leave the class because They 
felt an individual might have another Next Level mission outside of the classroom, however, 
some were asked to separate from the class in order to work on their overcoming at a 
distance.  

Those who chose to leave the class, left entirely because they chose NOT to continue 
serving their Older Member. 

We learned by experience that when an Older Member is present on the planet, any 
communication from the Next Level is directed through Their representative.  It is 
considered very inappropriate to make suggestions to this Representative (Ti and Do), for 
tasks we may want to do.  If  The Next level wanted us to do a task They would assign it 
through our Older Member directly (verbally), not by mental telepathy or little voices in 
our heads. We are not aware that Do assigned anyone the task of announcing when the "Brief 
Window" is closed.  No one can say with certainty that this "brief window" is closed.  
Only an Older Member from the Next Level would be in a position to state when that gate is 
closed. And we are not aware of any Older Members here now.
