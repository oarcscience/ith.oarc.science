### *TRANSCRIPTS OF VIDEO TAPE SERIES*

## *Late 1991 - Early 1992*

The ***Beyond Human*** series of video tapes, which we recorded in late
1991/early 1992, were broadcast at that time via satellite TV. These
video tapes represent the most comprehensive presentation of our
material to the public in our 21-year mission. Twelve in-depth
discussions of who we are, Next Level conduct, and Next Level thinking
are presented in 10 one-hour sessions and two longer sessions for a
total of approximately 13½ hours. Complete transcripts of all 12
sessions are included in this section.

During this time period, we used the name **Total Overcomers
Anonymous**, which we felt accurately described our position - that is,
our desire to overcome all aspects of the human kingdom, while remaining
at the same time, both separate and anonymous.
