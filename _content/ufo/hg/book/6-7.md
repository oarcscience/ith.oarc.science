**"UFO CULT"**

RESURFACES WITH

A FINAL OFFER

#### of the FORMULA for entering

**THE EVOLUTIONARY KINGDOM LEVEL ABOVE HUMAN**  
-- the *only real* Heaven

-- a *physical* Kingdom Level that *cannot* be entered "after you die"

-- one that exists in the literal heavens, with its own unique
biological "containers" or bodies, and modes of travel - spacecrafts or
"UFOs"

Entering it requires "midwifing" by an Older Member from that Kingdom
who is incarnate (in the human kingdom) to take you through that
"birthing."

That birthing requires: the shedding of all human-mammalian behavior,
such as sexuality (all forms); ties (to family, human relationships,
possessions, and responsibilities); addictions (of all types); habits;
and self-concerns.

This FORMULA was *first* offered to this civilization 2000 years ago, by
one Older Member from that Kingdom Level (who incarnated into a body
that was 29-30 years old).

It was offered a *second* time in 1975/76 by two Older Members from that
same Kingdom (who incarnated when the bodies that were "picked" and
"prepped" for them were in their early 40's).

It is *now* being offered, for the last time in this civilization, by
those students (from the 1975/76 "yield") who have been taken through
their "birthing" and are now representatives of that Kingdom Level.

The Representative 2000 years ago, the two Representatives who came this
time, and their students (the "yield") all *came* and *will leave* in
spacecrafts or "clouds of light."

REPRESENTATIVES FROM THAT "NEXT LEVEL" WILL SPEAK AT:
