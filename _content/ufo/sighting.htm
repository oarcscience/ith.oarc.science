Subject: New sighting last night in Gulf Breeze

To all interested parties:

Wednesday May 22nd, 1996
Gulf Breeze/Pensacola Beach Florida
10:10pm

Four people on the fishing pier witness 2 black triangular shaped
craft flying in formation at about 5,000 feet.  Each had a small
orange light in each corner.  The objects flew west to east toward
EGILN AIR BASE.  The witnesses reported that the craft were
completely silent as they passed over the unsuspecting heads of
about 150 people who were near the dock on the beach boardwalk.
One of the wintesses was an intern for The North American
Paranormal Network/TERRA NOVA.

We have tried contacting Pensacola Airport and EGLIN but have
received no "official" response as of yet.  We will pass along more
information as we investigate.

One important note is that the same two craft were reported the
previous night further down the beach at 9:45pm by two witnesses.
We do stress that these craft do not appear to be the AURORA which
is suppossedly being used out of EGLIN right now.  More information
as we receive it.  Thanks.
