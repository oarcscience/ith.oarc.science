    1) UFO RESEARCHER ACCUSED OF PLOT AGAINST POLITICIANS
        Key Figure In "Radium Plot" Heads Long Island UFO Network

    RIVERHEAD, N.Y. (Reuter) - Investigators uncovered an apparent plot to
    assassinate several Long Island, New York, local politicians with radioactive
    material, Suffolk County authorities said on Thursday, June 13.

    District Attorney James Catterson told a news conference that two men had
    been arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit murder. The alleged plot
    was "something out of a novel," he said, with radioactive material and
    weapons discovered in a house in Bellport, Long Island.

    Catterson said one of the suspects, 47-year-old John Ford, was soliciting
    people to use radium isotope against Suffolk County Republican Party leader
    John Powell when an informant alerted the District Attorney's office on
    Wednesday. Ford was then recorded on tape outlining the plot.

    Catterson described Ford as a former court officer and president of the Long
    Island UFO Network [LIUFON]. The other man arrested was identified as
    42-year-old Joseph Mazzachelli of Manorville, but no further information was
    available on him.

    "The plot was where an individual obsessed with hatred for mainstream
    political figures, with ballistics people would spread radioactive material
    in the seat of [the victim's] car, in his food or some proximity to him in
    the hope that he would contract incurable diseases and cause his death,"
    Catterson said.

    Apart from Powell, others targeted included two other Republicans, county
    legislator Fred Towle and Brookhaven public safety director Anthony Gazzola.

    Long Island is the political stronghold of Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
    but he was not on the plotters' list.

    Investigators found five canisters of radium, a low-level radioactive
    material, in Ford's home, Catterson said.

    "Any potential threat to public health and safety has been eliminated,"
    Catterson said in a statement. "There is no danger to the community and the
    material has been removed to a facility capable of its proper disposal."

    Investigators also found a cache of rifles and handguns, ammunition, a mine
    sweeper, gas mask and assorted militia literature, the Suffolk County
    District Attorney said. It was not known whether the men belonged to a
    militia.

    A third suspect was arrested Friday [June 14] in the alleged plot. Police
    found a small quantity of radium and weapons in the Medford, New York home of
    Edward Zabo, who was taken into custody, officials said.

    Further arrests were expected, officials said.

    2) CROP CIRCLE EXPERT COLIN ANDREWS REPORTS GLYPH
        DISCOVERED WITHIN STONEHENGE

    [CNI News has just received the following press release from Joyce Murphy
    (jmurphy@onramp.net) at Beyond Boundaries. The exact nature of the
    "discovered glyph" is unclear, but we will report further information as it
    becomes available.]

    World-renowned crop-circle investigator Colin Andrews reports a glyph
    discovered within Stonehenge. The very best Stonehenge investigators in the
    world, including the English Heritage Society,were not aware of any glyph's
    previous existence at this sacred site. Every square inch of Stonehenge has
    been recorded in the past, which makes this find even more amazing. Professor
    Gerald Hawkins, author of "Stonehenge Decoded" and "Beyond Sonehenge," is now
    studying the implications of the pattern which Colin says may be the
    foundation of the crop circles phenomenon.

    The glyph, partly covered by lichen and obviously not a fresh carving, was
    discovered shortly before dusk while Colin was in the company of a Beyond
    Boundaries group. Upon sighting the unusual symbol Colin requested the
    assistance of a Glasgow newspaper photographer who was covering a story about
    the expedition.  The side lighting on the photograph revealed more of the
    intriguing shape which is now is receiving international interest. More study
    of this phenomenon, along with investigation of current crop circles is being
    planned by Beyond Boundaries for July.

    For more information concerning this discovery and to obtain photos, email

    3) THE SAUCERS OF JUNE -- HISTORICAL RECOLLECTIONS

    [CNI News thanks UFO Roundup editor Masinaigan for permission to reprint the
    following item from Roundup number 18.]

    June is traditionally a big month for UFO sightings.  The famous Kenneth
    Arnold case took place on June 24, 1947.  But there have been other, equally
    interesting UFO events that took place in June. Here's a sample...

    June 16, 1909 -- Dong Hoi, Vietnam -- Van Thi Binh, 7, and her sisters were
    awakened by a whooshing sound at around 3 a.m.  As they looked out the
    window, they saw a glowing "bolide" flying slowly in an eastward direction
    over the city.  The bright white glow lit up the rooftops, and the "bolide"
    was seen by Vietnamese fishermen offshore. They watched it for 8 to 10
    minutes before it abruptly dropped into the South China Sea.  Although it
    couldn't possibly have been a bolide or detonating meteor (not at that slow
    speed!), it was written up as such in the French magazine L'Astronomie.  (See
    the book ANATOMY OF A PHENOMENON by Jacques Vallee, page 28)

    June 20, 1953 -- Brush Creek, near Willow Creek, California -- Two
    prospectors saw a UFO land in the meadow.  An occupant came out of the
    object.  He was described as 3 feet tall and wearing silvery gray
    tight-fitting garments and a hood or helmet.  Ignoring the two astounded
    miners, the occupant carried a small silver pail to the creek, filled it with
    water, and then walked back to the UFO.  Two minutes later, the UFO "shot
    into the sky without a sound."

    June 30, 1954 -- Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada -- A British Overseas Airways
    Corporation (BOAC) Stratocruiser airliner, piloted by Capt. James Howard,
    approached Goose Bay at 9 p.m. local time, on its New York to London flight.
     Suddenly, Capt. Howard saw a large object "something like an inverted pear
    suspended in the sky."  The UFO was accompanied by six saucers -- three
    forward, three aft.  The Goose Bay tower told Howard that there were no other
    aircraft in the area.  Capt. Howard and his co-pilot, Lee Boyd, watched as
    the large UFO reshaped itself "into what looked like a flying arrow -- an
    enormous delta-winged plane turning in to close with us."  The large UFO
    paced the BOAC Stratocruiser for over 15 minutes before departing.  Other
    witnesses included chief navigator George Allen, chief radio operator Douglas
    Cox, flight engineers Daniel Godfrey and William Stewart and stewardess
    Daphne Webster.

    June 26, 1972 -- Port Beaufort, South Africa -- Farm worker Boer de Klerk was
    watering cattle in a krans (pasture) at Braeside, a large farm just outside
    Port Beaufort.  Suddenly, he saw a plume of smoke in the sunny cloudless sky.
     The smoke drifted towards him and then exploded into a roaring fireball.
     Terrified, de Klerk dropped his bucket and ran to fetch the owner, Bennie
    Smit.  Rounding up a group of his workers, Smit returned to the spot and
    found the bright orange fireball flying aimlessly around the pasture.  As the
    men climbed the fence, the fireball halted, then backed away from them, and
    then climbed up, up and away.

    4) SPIELBERG PLANS ANOTHER "ET"-TYPE FILM

    [The following item is excerpted from a longer story that appeared in AOL
    News Profiles on June 14, from Reuter/Variety.]

    HOLLYWOOD - Sixteen years after Steven Spielberg's "E.T. The
    Extraterrestrial" became a box office smash, the director's DreamWorks studio
    has bought a screenplay and the feature film rights to the book,
    "Extraterrestrials: A Field Guide for Earthlings," sources said.

    The project, which will be re-titled "Alien Zoo," is about an alien ship that
    crash lands on Earth, where the aliens are moved to a zoo. When they escape,
    they begin wreaking havoc.

    The project, which Disney also bid on, is a special-effects, big-budget
    vehicle. The book was published in 1994 by Camden House and was written by
    Terence Dickenson and Adolf Schaller.

    ========================================================

    5) SAGAN: NEW DISCOVERIES SHOW OTHER PLANET SYSTEMS NOT
        LIKE OURS, BUT LIFE "OUT THERE" STILL LIKELY

    [The following comments are excerpted from an article by Carl Sagan titled
    "So Many Suns, So Many Worlds," which appeared in Parade Magazine on June 9,
    1996. Sagan is discussing newly discovered planets around the stars 51
    Pegasi, 70 Virginis, 47 Ursae Majoris and 55 Cancri.]

    The masses of these planets seem to range from a little less than Jupiter to
    several times greater than Jupiter.  What is most surprising about them is
    how close to their stars they are, from 0.05 AU for 51 Pegasi to a little
    more than 2 AU for 47 Ursae Majoris. [AU = astronomical unit, the distance
    from earth to the sun or 93 million miles.]

    There may of course be smaller, Earthlike planets in these systems not yet
    discovered, but the layout is not like ours.  In our solar system, we have
    the small Earthlike planets on the inside and the large Jupiterlike planets
    on the outside.  For these four stars, the Jupiter-mass planets seem to be on
    the inside.  How that could be, no one now understands.

    As for life on these new worlds, it is no more likely than on our own
    Jupiter.  But what is probable is that these other Jupiters have moons, like
    the 16 that circle our Jupiter. Because these moons, like the giant worlds
    they orbit, are close to the local star, their temperatures, especially in
    the 70 Virginis system, might be clement enough for life.  At 35 to 40
    light-years away, these worlds are close enough for us to begin to dream of
    one day sending fast spacecraft to visit them, the data to be received by our
    descendants.

    To me, it appears likely that in the coming decades we will have information
    on at least hundreds of other planetary systems close to us in the vast Milky
    Way Galaxy--and perhaps even a few small blue worlds graced with water
    oceans, oxygen atmospheres and the telltale signs of wondrous life.
