### Military Brass Go Public With Explosive New Information

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Military brass go public
    with explosive new
    information

    By COLMAN JONES

    While for most people the subject of UFOs and aliens arouses no more
    than mild amusement, if not outright derision, the recent recruitment of
    high-profile former doubters to the believers=92 side is shaking up a
    new round of dissonance.

    In recent weeks, some of these converts have joined a long list of
    credible UFO enthusiasts who have been featured in a flurry of
    television and radio programs in the U.S. and England, programs that are
    no longer treating the extraterrestrial issue as a comedic interlude.

    These newcomers to the cause wonder how long we will continue to stand
    idly by and let deliberately evasive governments shield the world=92s
    peoples from what may be the most important and potentially dangerous
    news ever to surface that we are not alone in the universe.

    The most significant military UFO recruit is Nick Pope, the British
    government=92s appointed investigator of UFO sightings who headed
    Britain=92s secretariat air staff 2A division between 1991 and 94.

    Unlike his predecessors, who merely rubber-stamped sighting reports,
    Pope contacted witnesses and civilian UFO researchers, checking aircraft
    movements, airship flightpaths and weather-balloon launches and ordering
    radar tapes to be impounded and sent to him for analysis.

    After rigorous investigation,=94 Pope says,=93I uncovered conventional
    explanations for around 90 per cent of sightings. But 10 per cent simply
    could not be explained, and it was my belief that some of these were
    extraterrestrial in origin.

    There were too many cases where we were obviously not just talking about
    lights or shapes, but we clearly had evidence that there were structured
    craft, where the technology went way beyond even the cutting edge of our
    own.

    Not pleased

    Pope is still working as a major for the UK ministry of defence,
    although his higher-ups have been none too pleased with his work and
    have attempted to discourage publication of his book, Open Skies, Closed
    Minds, due for publication in June by Simon and Shuster.

    "(What lay behind the resistance) was the closed-minded attitude,=94 he
    says.=93It was people=92s embarrassment that perhaps I was going to talk
    about cases where we had visual sightings and radiation readings and
    where we could show that, unfortunately, the end response of the
    department was to do nothing."

    Another high-ranking addition to the UFO cause is Edgar Mitchell, the
    65-year-old Apollo 14 astronaut and the sixth man to walk on the moon.
    In 1971, he and Alan Shepard spent 33 hours roving the desolate lunar
    hills. It was here that Mitchell first courted an avant-garde
    reputation, conducting mental telepathy experiments by transmitting
    symbolic images to an acquaintance in Chicago.

    Shortly thereafter, he left the astronaut corps and founded the
    Institute for Noetic Sciences in an effort to integrate various
    scientific disciplines into the study of human consciousness. (Noetics
    comes from the Greek work for mind.)

    Mitchell's upcoming book, The Way Of The Explorer, addresses his latest
    research, including his conclusions about extraterrestrial intelligence.

    Speaking from his home in Florida, he says,=93The evidence has
    accumulated to the point that it can no longer be ignored. There is a
    body of solid, powerful, credible evidence=97 surrounded by a whole lot
    of disinfo rmation, misinformation and silliness.=94

    Solid evidence

    Mitchell has tried to gather up as much first-hand data as possible. "I
    have personally gone out of my way to interview government people I can
    have some respect for, who have given firsthand accounts of
    (extraterrestrial) contact of different sorts. I can't reveal these
    people, because they are under security restriction."

    Their accounts have convinced the former astronaut to join the growing
    campaign to press for lifting the gag orders on talking about UFOs. He
    is also pushing, along with 20,000 others, for an executive order to
    declassify any U.S. government-held information on the stirring 1947
    affair at Roswell, New Mexico, where the U.S. air force allegedly
    retrieved the remains of a crashed spaceship complete with alien
    occupants' a tale that continues to fascinate millions.

    Mitchell is only one of several astronauts to go public with what they
    know about UFOs. Another is major Gordon Cooper, one of the original
    seven astronauts who helped pioneer space exploration efforts. But
    unlike most of his colleagues, Cooper has said for decades that he
    believes at least some UFOs are alien spacecraft, testifying to that
    effect in front of the UN in 1978.

    Cooper, who today runs an aerospace management company in Van Nuys,
    California, had already been a firm believer before he flew into space.
    Ten years earlier, in the early 50s, he was assigned to a jet fighter
    group in Germany. While stationed there, he remembers sighting an entire
    formation of circular metallic objects as he piloted his F-86 Sabrejet.

    "We saw these objects coming over at quite a good altitude, flying in
    fighter formations,=94 he says. We tried to get up to them, but we
    couldn't get anywhere near as high as they were. They continued for
    about two days, coming over in great numbers."

    With so many reports of strange happenings, UFO types trained in
    military culture are astounded at governments' apparent indifference to
    the possible strategic implications of all these unexplained phenomena.

    That's the concern of retired British admiral of the fleet Lord
    Hill-Norton, former chief of the defence staff and chair of the NATO
    military committee during the mid-70s.

    The government says that the matter is investigated,=94 he says from his
    home near London. They admit readily 300 or 400 reports a year, which
    they investigate. The ministry's official line is this is not of any
    defence interest. This is silly talk, of course.

    The security aspect of such sightings has been exhaustively explored by
    British writer Timothy Good, whose definitive 1987 book Above Top Secret
    soared up the best-seller lists. His latest entry, Beyond Top Secret:
    The Worldwide UFO Security Threat, with a foreword by Hill-Norton and
    published just last week, is a fully revised edition, citing over 100
    new sightings reported by military and civilian pilots around the world.

    The new book's focus is on the potential defence risks posed by UFOs.
    Good notes, "They interfere with aircraft communications systems and
    military weapons systems and jam radars. There have been quite a number
    of aircraft which have gone missing during close encounters with UFOs,
    in countries as far apart as the U.S. and Iran."

    These devices have been seen over nuclear missile bases and atomic
    energy commission installations in the U.S. since the 1940s. They have
    been known to paralyze launching systems of guided missiles. Here in
    Britain, at the famous Woodbridge case in 1980 (where U.S. military
    officers reported a bright triangular-shaped object landing in a field),
    at least one of the witnesses has confirmed that beams of light were
    shone down at a nuclear weapons storage area. Surely this poses a
    security threat.

    Lobbying friends

    The latest figure to enter the fray is the 85-year-old environmental
    activist and venture capitalist Laurance Rockefeller, son of John D.
    Rockefeller Jr. and brother of Nelson. For the last few years,
    Rockefeller has been lobbying his friends in political circles for any
    information they may have on extraterrestrial life. More recently, he
    agreed to fund a research report presenting the strongest proof of alien
    visits.

    The 169-page document, entitled Unidentified Flying Objects Briefing
    Document: The Best Available Evidence, has the support of the three
    major American UFO organizations and has been sent to U.S. president
    Bill Clinton, Congress and other world leaders.

    The report, a copy of which has been obtained by NOW, includes case
    histories of UFO sightings.

    "It is this large quantity of evidence of the existence of something
    completely baffling," the document says, "which motivates many of us to
    urge the governments of the world to release all they know about UFOs so
    that the people of the world, and especially scientists, can begin to
    come to grips with a mystery that has far too long been subjected to
    secrecy and ridicule."

    With all this ferment, it's somewhat sobering to note that the Canadian
    government is utterly uninterested.

    In Winnipeg, at the Canadian forces' aerospace control and surveillance
    centre, staff officer captain Jim McLean tells me that our air force
    gathers reports of UFO sightings, but little else. "In essence, what
    this office does is accumulate all the files and reports, and keep them
    on file=97 we don't assess or investigate them."

    McLean says the government used to look into unusual sightings, but "it
    took up too much time for things that used to prove to be natural
    events, i.e. meteor showers. It took up many, many man-hours. We hold
    them on file, and can copy everything and send it off to anybody who's
    interested."

    SIDEBAR

    What would happen IF...?
    by Colman Jones

    On January 1, 2000, Bill Clinton enters a Rose Garden press conference,
    accompanied by other world leaders.

    Staring straight into the news cameras, the U.S. president solemnly
    declares, "I have an important announcement to make: we now have reason
    to believe that this planet has been visited by extraterrestrial beings
    who are studying our race. Their ultimate intentions are unknown."

    What if this unearthly scenario were actually to transpire? How would
    the world's peoples react?

    It's a question that some of the world's best minds have long been
    contemplating, and their conclusions may shed light on why governments
    have not been more forthcoming on the subject of UFOs and aliens -
    namely, the fear of the public reaction that such a blatant declaration
    would provoke.

    For example, according to a 1960 report prepared for NASA by the
    Brookings Institution, a Washington thinktank, discovery of life on
    other worlds could cause the earth's civilization to collapse.

    Citing anthropological studies, it noted, "societies sure of their own
    place have disintegrated when confronted by a superior society, and
    others have survived even though changed."

    "Clearly, the better we can come to understanding the factors involved
    in responding to such crisis the better prepared we may be."

    But at a special 1972 symposium on extraterrestrial intelligence held at
    Boston University, Nobel Prize winner George Wald took a more
    pessimistic view. "I can conceive of no nightmare so terrifying as
    establishing such communication with a so-called superior technology in
    outer space," he testified.

    A 1975 report produced by the Library of Congress for the House
    Committee on Science and Technology also warned against automatically
    assuming that open contact with other life forms, if discovered, would
    benefit humanity. "Since we have no knowledge of their nature, we may be
    aiding in our own doom", it said, and went on to speculate about a
    foreign civilization's possible negative views on a lower technological
    society, seeing it as a threat.

    "It's a huge unknown", agrees Michael Michaud, a former U.S. State
    Department career diplomat for 32 years, serving at U.S. embassies all
    over the world, specializing in environment, science and technology. He
    has written extensively on the implications of extraterrestrial contact.
    In an article published in the journal of the American Institute of
    Aeronautics and Astronautics, Michaud noted that discovery of
    extraterrestrial life by military authorities might not necessarily be
    made available to the public.

    Reached at his home in Geneva, Switzerland, the now retired diplomat
    cites a late 1970s incident, in which he was personally involved, in
    which a nuclear-powered Soviet satellite was discovered by the U.S. to
    be losing its orbit, descending towards the earth with a nuclear reactor
    on board.=20

    Michaud recalls "this was discussed intensively between ourselves and
    the Soviets, and later with certain other governments, long before any
    public release of the information was made. That affair was classified
    until it was announced publicly after the satellite came down, so it's
    entirely conceivable that a government might handle the [discovery of
    extraterrestrial life] the same way, if it were done only through
    governmental means."

    Michaud has frequently argued that one of the most profound effects
    would be the feeling of common identity that might be generated by
    contact. Bringing his 32 years in diplomacy to bear on this, Michaud
    says the outside identity contrasting with our own might be potentially
    very useful. "I'm not sure it will solve all our squabbles, but it will
    make them seen a lot less important, and there will be larger context in
    which they will be placed."

    Stanton Friedman, considered by many the grand-daddy of ufologists, says
    there are plenty of reasons for a UFO coverup. Interviewed at his home
    in Fredericton, New Brunswick, the 61-year-old nuclear physicist points
    out that military considerations would override all others, especially
    as concerns the technology underlying alien spacecraft - "you want to
    figure how the damn things work. Say you've got wreckage, you set up
    your secret project - the basic rule for security is that you can't tell
    your friends without telling your enemies."

    For this reason, Friedman says, military authorities would have a vested
    interest in keeping recovery of alien vehicles under wraps. "What if the
    other guy figures out how they work before you do?"

    Obviously, such a revelation would also pull the rug under from many of
    our most cherished institutions, be they religious, economic, or
    political. As Friedman notes, "the biggest implication here is loss of
    power to people who have it. What would happen is that the younger
    generation would immediately push for a new view of ourselves, instead
    as Canadians, American, Russians, Chinese, etc., but as earthlings."

    "That would be splendid, until you realize that there's no government on
    this planet that wants its citizens to owe ther primary allegiance to
    the planet instead of that individual government. Nationalism is the
    only game in town."
