                                   General Topics

    Why was this mission chosen for the       Could this mission stand alone,
    Discovery Program?                        and how does it complement other
                                              missions?
    Describe how Mars Pathfinder is unique,   What is being done to make sure
    and how it follows the "better, faster,   it doesn't go the way of Mars
    cheaper" philosphy.                       Observer?
    What planetary protection measures are
    being used on Mars Pathfinder and Mars
    Global Surveyor?

    Why (in your opinion) was this mission chosen for the Discovery program
    versus other proposed missions?

    Mars Pathfinder and the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission were
    not chosen by the same process as the later Discovery missions. Pathfinder
    was originally designedto demonstration technology for inexpensive entry and
    landing on Mars, as a precursor to a network of landers called Mars
    Environmental Survey, or MESUR. Because Pathfinder was the first mission it
    fell into what was then considered a "Discovery" mission class - that is it
    had to be done for less than $150M in 1992 dollars. The MESUR Network
    missions were never funded, but Pathfinder is now a technology demonstration
    for landers in the Mars Surveyor program. Later Discovery missions are being
    chosen through Announcements of Opportunity and are being developed by teams
    headed by scientists.


    -!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This mission seems to be part of a series starting with the Mars Global
    Surveyor, but those other missions are not part of the Discovery program.
    Could this mission stand alone if necessary? How does it complement the
    other (US and internationally) planned missions?

    Pathfinder is a "Discovery" mission. The Mars Surveyor Program is separate
    from Discovery and will launch one or two missions to Mars at every
    opportunity (every 26 months). Mars Global Surveyor launches in November
    1996, Mars Surveyor 98 will launch an orbiter and a lander in December 1998
    and January 1999. The 98 Surveyor missions are both using Pathfinder
    components, especially the computer and software. The Mars Surveyor 98
    lander is using much of the entry and descent technology demonstrated by
    Pathfinder, including the aeroshell and the parachute. The science from
    Pathfinder will be completely complementary with the Surveyor Program
    science. In fact, the Mars Surveyor 98 lander is using the same camera and
    weather station technology that Pathfinder is using.

    In addition to the U.S. missions, Russia will launch Mars 96 in November
    1996. It comprises an orbiter, two small landers, and two penetrators. There
    is a U.S. experiment on the landers and the landers and penetrators will
    relay data through the Mars Global Surveyor orbiter. Pathfinder carries
    instruments provided by several different countries. The Mars Surveyor 98
    missions also have international payloads, including Russian contributions
    to the U.S. Infrared Radiometer on the orbiter, and to the lander payload.
    The Japanese will fly an aeronomy orbiter in 1998 to study the upper
    atmosphere of Mars. A U.S. instrument is scheduled to be on board this
    Japanese mission.

    We are currently studying the feasibility of a joint U.S.-Russian mission
    called Mars Together in 2001. One option for this mission is for the U.S. to
    launch an orbiter, and to provide a "carrier" spacecraft to be launched with
    a Russian lander on a Russian launch vehicle. We are also studying a sample
    return mission which could be made affordable by partnering with other
    countries.

    -!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Describe your spacecraft and instruments including what is unique, versus
    ones in the past, that allowed it to be built quickly and cheaply?

    The Mars Pathfinder spacecraft is quite different from other missions built
    at JPL. First of all, as a lander mission, the prime focus is on getting the
    lander/rover instrument package safely to the surface of Mars. This means
    that this spacecraft must be able to electro-mechanically transform itself
    autononmously from a "cruise" configuration much like a Galileo (without the
    cruise science observations of course) into a stable science platform on the
    surface of Mars. All of this must be done on a budget quite small compared
    with previous planetary missions. This adds considerably to the technical
    challenge.

    These challenges were met by first taking maximal advantage of past work: we
    "inherited" hardware from the Cassini mission to Saturn; we utilized designs
    of equipment flown to Mars on the Viking missions of the 70's; and we have
    an improved understanding of the environmental uncertainties from science
    observations obtained over the last 2 decades. Secondly, improvements in
    computer technology have allowed us to model, design and test aspects of our
    system that were impossible 20 years ago. Finally, we have built a small
    "Skunkworks-like" team that has accomplished only that work necessary to do
    the mission, with little red tape nor redundancy in effort.


    -!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    What is being done to make sure it doesn't disappear like the Mars Observer?

    No one can build a complex spacecraft that is absolutely guranteed to work.
    Embarking on unique, first-of-a-kind enterprises, by their very nature,
    invoke risk taking. However we can go to great lengths within the limits of
    our budget to minimize technical risk. Much like the design process leading
    to a passenger jet, spacecraft designers must ensure that design margins
    conservatively exceed the uncertainty in the expected environment and that
    the spacecraft is tested to those environments. Much work then must be
    placed in understanding the environment, followed by as much testing as
    money and time will allow. We feel quite certain (and many independent
    reviewers have agreed) that although Mars Pathfinder is about 1/10th total
    mission cost of Mars Observer, that we have struck an appropriate balance
    between cost and risk.

    --Rob Manning, Mars Pathfinder Flight System Chief Engineer


    -!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In what way do planetary protection provisions affect Mars lander missions
    (such as Pathfinder) and Mars orbiter missions (such as Global Surveyor)?

    The major impact of the planetary protection requirements on Pathfinder is
    that we must carefully clean the spacecraft before launch in order to keep
    from contaminating Mars. Although scientists now believe that it would be
    difficult to sustain and cultivate life on Mars, they would prefer that we
    not take any chances. They have developed a system for rating different
    missions by the potential impact that they could have. The most stringent
    missions are those which will be returning samples from Mars or are
    performing life detection experiments there. In both cases, complete
    sterilization is required. In our case (and MGS), we are allocated a
    specific number of biologic spores which are deemed acceptable. We have to
    clean the spacecraft (or perform mission design tricks - I write about
    below) to reduce the number of spores below this level (I am glad to say
    that we are well below the acceptable number). The only parts of the
    spacecraft which we actually need to clean is the part that will come in
    contact with the Martian atmosphere and surface. The other parts (meaning
    the third stage and cruise stage) do not have to be cleaned because they
    will either not hit Mars (we specifically bias the aim point of the Delta
    away from Mars so that upper stage does not hit the planet) or will burn up
    during entry (we had to perform a break-up re-entry analysis of the cruise
    stage to prove this will occur). MGS did not have to do any planetary
    protection related cleaning because they can guarantee that the spacecraft
    will not enter the Martian atmosphere for a long time with high probability.

    While watching pre-launch
    pictures, technicians
    appear dressed in isolation
    suits. Why?

    Why it is that 2:09 a.m. on 2 December (and earlier times on dates
    thereafter) is the precise time Pathfinder must launch? What is is about the
    Earth's position that makes this important?

    When the spacecraft leaves the Earth to go to Mars, it must be going in a
    particular direction. Since the Earth rotates, the launch site is only lined
    up with this direction twice per day (for an instant in each case). Since
    the two opportunities are about 12 hours apart, the launch vehicle people
    make us choose one or the other. It is okay to launch at a time slightly
    different from the ideal time because the spacecraft can use it's propulsion
    system to correct for the error. The spacecraft has a limited amount of
    fuel, however, so we can't accept a very big error (up to approximately 1
    minute is okay).

    You can see all of Mars Pathfinder's launch opportunities at the Launch
    Windows Page.


    -!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Does the fairing of the Delta II rocket fall away in two pieces or more?

    Two.


    -!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Very briefly, can you explain why the second stage temporarily shuts down at
    9 minutes 20 seconds after launch and starts up again about an hour later?

    The first burn of the second stage is used to place the spacecraft in a low
    parking orbit around the Earth. It then coasts until it gets to the right
    point in its orbit to do the burn to go to Mars. The second stage then
    ignites again to begin pushing the spacecraft towards Mars. The third stage
    finishes off the job because the second stage fuel tanks are nearly empty.


    -!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    What is the exact time after launch that the spacecraft enters Earth's
    shadow?

    It depends on launch date. For December 2, we go into shadow at 3:15 am and
    exit at 3:45 am.


    -!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    After emerging from the shadow, the first two-way communication between
    Earth and the spacecraft is from "flight managers at JPL" -- is this
    accurate?

    This is not quite correct. The spacecraft begins transmitting when it
    separates from the third stage (at about 3:25 am). The Deep Space Network
    station in Goldstone, California should detect this signal about five
    minutes later, and we should begin to get engineering data from the
    spacecraft. We don't actually try and send a command to the spacecraft for
    several more hours (about 4-5 hours after launch). All of these operations
    are conducted by engineers at JPL.

    --Richard Cook, Mars Pathfinder Mission Operations Manager


    -!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    How many miles (kilometers) will the spacecraft fly to Mars, and how many
    miles (kilometers) will the Earth be from Mars on arrival day (4 July,
    1997)?

    Because the path which the spacecraft takes to get to Mars, essentially
    "catching up" to the planet, it will travel approximately 312 million miles
    (500 million kilometers) in its seven month journey. However, when
    Pathfinder actually arrives at the planet, the Earth and Mars will be
    separated by approximately 120 million miles (200 million kilometers).

    --Dave Spencer, Mars Pathfinder Trajectory and Navigation Team Member


    -!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    While watching pre-launch pictures, technicians appear dressed in isolation
    suits. Why?

    Technicians and engineers that work in the vicinity of the lander must wear
    what we call "bunny" suits (it was a joke name originally, but many years
    ago the name caught on). These are clean head-to-toe garments that prevent
    dirt and biological contamination of the lander by the workers.

    At other times when the hydrazine fuel was being loaded into Pathfinder's
    fuel tanks, some workers had to wear "SCAPE" suits. These suits are also
    head-to-toe, but they also provide self-contained breathing equipment which
    is strapped to their backs. In fact they look a lot like space suits.
    Hydrazine, in addition to being highly flammable, is an extremely caustic
    and dangerous liquid. These suits are designed to protect the workers in the
    unlikely event of a hydrazine leak.

    Mars?                  operation?              rock?

    parachute from falling landing near the        petal/airbags vs.
    on the lander?         so-called "face"?       traditional landing gear?
    Why is Pathfinder
    landing at night (Mars
    local time)?

    If the Mars atmosphere is less than 1% than that of Earth, how can a
    parachute of the size you are using be sufficient? It would seem to me that
    you would need a parachute close to 1000' wide to achieve the same effect.

    Would you please explain the dynamics of placing a lander on Mars, and why a
    small parachute would work on Mars as it does on Earth?

    You ask a very insightful question. The bottom line is you're right,
    parachutes this small aren't sufficient on Mars! On Mars Pathfinder, as on
    Viking, we use a "small" 40.5 ft (12.5 m) chute. It was scaled so that, with
    our lighter lander, it does about as much for the our descent speed as does
    Viking's. Our terminal velocity seconds before getting to the ground (where
    the atmosphere is "thickest") is still about 65 m/s (146 mph)!!

    You are correct, it would indeed take a a larger chute to get slower
    "normal" Earth-like terminal velocities. Our chute on Mars is about the
    equivalent of a chute 38 times smaller in area on Earth (6.5 ft across!),
    and this includes the effect of Mars' lower gravity! A chute that could
    lower our lander to the Martian ground at a gentle 10 m/s (22 mph) would
    have to have an area about 42 times larger than our "little" chute (or a
    diameter of 263 ft)! That's 42 times the mass (and volume) of our 10 kg
    chute, or 420 kg, more than the mass of our entire lander! It wouldn't fit!
    We would need to have a "gossamer" (ultra-light weight material) parachute
    and then figure out how to get it open at high speeds!

    This is why we turned to solid rockets to stop our lander just before we hit
    the ground. Viking, too, used liquid rockets to slow the terminal decent.
    Also Pathfinder's airbags protect the lander from the local terrain
    variations (bumps, craters, rocks, hills, etc.) after the rockets do their
    thing.

    So why do we do we use a chute at all? Well, parachutes might not be all
    that good a laying a lander gently down on the Martian surface, but they do
    a spectacular job of braking something moving very fast. Remember, the drag
    FORCE a chute generates (therefore its deceleration), is proportional to the
    square of the velocity and only linearly proportional to the atmospheric
    density; so even a thin atmosphere and a "small" chute will do much to slow
    our entry vehicle down once the heatshield's aerobraking has been mostly
    achieved.

    This is also true of heatshields, our entry vehicle (like Viking's) enters
    the upper atmosphere at 7 km/s (or more than 15,000 mph!). Most of this is
    reduced by the friction with the heathsield. But even 2 minutes later, our
    vehicle is still screaming in at nearly 400 m/s (900 mph) when the parachute
    opens before slowing down to 65 m/s near the ground. I'd say that reducing
    our velocity by a factor of 6 (a factor of 36 in kinetic energy), isn't all
    that bad for only 10 kg of extra payload mass, wouldn't you?

    So, the short answer is, you're right, parachutes don't work on Mars like
    they do on Earth (neither do airbags, but that is another story), but they
    do a great job when you need to slow down something that is whipping through
    the Martian atmosphere FAST!

    As with other missions, the ability to deploy the panels for solar use, high
    gain communications, or any other use for that matter, has not been as good
    as could be. What has been done in ensuring successful operation now or in
    the future? It seems without them opening up all the way it can cause major
    problems. Like Galileo's high gain antenna and Mars Surveyor's 20 degree
    shortfall in deployment of its solar panels.

    The problems associated with moving parts are difficult ones to solve. Since
    the cost to send one kilogram of material into space is so high, spacecraft
    designers must be very stingy in allocating mass to the engineers who make
    the mechanisms. You might be surprised that the typical spacecraft mechanism
    can be destroyed with your bare hands!

    The other part of this equation is that MOST of the time, mechanisms must
    only need do their jobs under rather benign weightless conditions in space,
    BUT they must also be able to handle the much rougher conditions that
    precede getting there: ground handling and launch. It is these phases of the
    mechanism's life that are the most traumatic. They are the most difficult to
    quantify as well. I don't think the designers of the Galileo high gain
    antenna mechanism would have expected that the antenna would be closed for
    so long before finally opened in flight and that it would have had to
    survive three cross-country road trips in a van! (Both of these events were
    a direct result of the Challenger disaster.)

    There is no magic formula for making mechanisms work in all situations, but
    we have been learning just how subtle these problems can be. The trick is to
    learn from your (and other people's) mistakes. Mars Pathfinder has more than
    its share of moving parts. We knew that going in, so we went out of our way
    to be a bit paranoid about it. We hired the very best spacecraft mechanical
    engineers we could find. Going to Mars made the job a bit more difficult in
    some cases because of our need to have the mechanisms work under very harsh
    environmental conditions (harsher even than in deep space). For example, the
    Rover, the IMP camera and the high gain antenna actuators must all work
    under very cold conditions (as low as -90 deg C). Most lubricants do not
    lubricate at those temperatures. We had to make sure that the actuators were
    either warmed before they were used or had adequate torque margins for the
    motor to overcome the sticky lubricant before it warmed up with use. In some
    cases we "overkilled" the problem (e.g. the lander petal actuators) and
    provided much more torque than we thought we really needed - just in case.
    (I could go on and on.) It is safe to say that the mechanisms on Mars
    Pathfinder were a LOT of work. But we tested and tested them (even beating
    them up!) under many rough conditions until we were finally satisfied that
    they will work fine when we need them to.


    -!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    What is stopping the lander from "landing" on a large rock, and making it
    impossible to open up the craft to do its thing on Mars?

    We all wondered about this at the beginning. So we tried it! First of all,
    it turns out that we had a hard time getting the inflated, 17 ft beachball
    of a lander close to a big rock! As long as those airbags stayed inflated,
    it wanted to roll away from anything big and pointy. Secondly, even when we
    did manage to coax it right next to a wicked boulder, the petals opened
    right up even if it meant having the whole lander do a backflip! It took
    some work, but we actually made that happen once in our Mars Yard at JPL and
    without damage! It really helped that the petal actuators (a motor and a
    gear train mounted on each of the three petal hinge lines) had the torque
    margin to actually LIFT the lander off of the ground (they can even
    indefinitely support the lander in a sort of "iron cross" once open). And
    these tests were done under Earth's gravity, which gave the rocks a distinct
    advantage. With many many tests behind us, in not one case would it have got
    stuck.


    -!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    What stops the parachute from falling onto the craft and gumming things up
    that way?

    Lots of people asked us that question at the beginning. If you don't give
    this some serious thought, there is a real risk that the lander could get
    covered by the chute (a bit more than embarrassing). Fortunately we designed
    the timing and sizing of the solid rocket firing (remember there are three
    mounted inside the backshell) such that when the lander inside its inflated
    airbags comes to a stop some 12 m above the Martian surface, the software
    activates a cutter that cuts away the bridle thereby freeing the backshell
    from the lander. The rockets, with still a quarter second of impulse left
    over, launch the backshell up and away taking the parachute with it (at an
    angle, tumbling as it goes). Meanwhile the lander and airbag go bouncing
    away in the other direction! (Don't you wish you could be there to watch it
    all happen?). You can click here to see an artist's rendition of this
    procedure...

    -!--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    To satisfy the curious, Pathfinder should have landed near the so-called
    Face/Pyramid area. Or is that a hoax?

    That there is a rock formation on Mars that looks somewhat like a face is
    certainly true, but it is also true there are many similar naturally
    occuring structures on the Earth, Moon and Mars that resemble faces, animals
    and even man-made designs. The best way to see what large geologic stuctures
    exist on Mars is to use the high resolution cameras on board the
    recently-launched Mars Global Surveyor. Mars Pathfinder can not be
    accurately aimed to any site smaller than a typical US county. We are
    specifically targeting the ancient Ares Vallis outflow channel. Fortunately
    the channel is big so we will not miss it! This site is ideally suited to
    Mars Pathfinder's geologic mission. We believe a huge flood carved that
    channel and deposited a large number and variety of rocks from the highland
    water source into the flood basin where we intend to land. Our miniature
    robotic geologist, the Sojourner Rover, will be able to analyse these
    various rock types and give us an idea of how they were formed and about
    Mars' early history.

    In addition, all of the power for the spacecraft is collected from solar
    panels. In order to get maximum power, one of the landing site requirements
    was to have the sun be high in the sky. This restricted the landing site to
    +/- 20 degrees from the equator of Mars. Cydonia (where the so-called "face"
    is located) is at too high of a latitude for the lander to receive adequate
    power.
