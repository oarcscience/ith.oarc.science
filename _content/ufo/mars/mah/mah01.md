#### DEDICATION

To the millions of God's children on this earth enthralled in darkness,
for whom the solicitude of the Father is now in evidence, this book is
dedicated.

May it be a beacon to light the way of weary searchers after TRUTH.

One hemisphere of Mars showing the North Polar Cap and the main Canal
System covering the planet. The many thousands of small lateral canals,
radiating from the larger waterways, and which form an important part of
the general plan, have been purposely omitted from the above to avoid
confusion. The circular spots and dots are the principal reservoirs used
for impounding water for use during the long Martian summer. The dark
areas shown in the drawing are Mars ancient sea bottoms now covered with
vegetation. It will be observed that most of the canals are double,
paralleling each other at a distance of about seventy-five miles.
Centers of population are not shown for the reason that space is not
available on so small a drawing. The City of Urid is situated adjacent
to the reservoir in the center of drawing, just north of the equator.
