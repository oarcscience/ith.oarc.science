<P>
In the early years of the twentieth century Percivel Lowell and others
speculated that Mars was inhabitated by an intelligent species much older than
our civilization.
This page archives texts (fictional and otherwise) about this hypothesis.

<I>About the photo</I>:
This is a recent (2001) 
Mars Orbiter photo of the notorious 'face' formation
in the Cydonia region.
Is it just an unusually symmetrical mesa or a huge, heavily eroded
<I>artificial</I> landform?
You be the judge...
It helps if you view this photo at a distance or squint a bit.
