# My Trip to Mars

## by William Ferguson

#### \[1955, no renewal\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a short account by an early UFO contactee. Mr. Ferguson, who
also wrote a pamphlet called *Relax First,* tells us without any trace
of irony that 'I had become adept at the art of relaxation.' One day in
1938, while 'relaxing,' he has an out-of-body experience, during which
he takes a trip to Mars and meets its kindly, optimistic inhabitants.
Naturally, they have a epochal message for Mr. Ferguson...
