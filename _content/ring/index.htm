<P>
J.R.R. Tolkiens' Middle Earth did not come out of thin air.
Tolkien, an academic linguist, drew on the following
source materials to inspire his world-building exercise.
The texts presented at this site are complete and in some
cases in the original languages.
</P>

<P>

<A HREF="../neu/kveng/index">The Kalevala. [English]</A><BR>

<A HREF="../neu/kvfin/index">The Kalevala. [Finnish]</A><BR>
This Finnish saga, replete with battling wizards and heroes, quests and
magical objects has been cited as one of the early inspirations
for Tolkien.  The languages of Middle Earth also have more than a
passing resemblance to Finnish.
</P>

<P>

<A HREF="../neu/poe/index">The Elder (Poetic) Edda.</A><BR>

<A HREF="../neu/pre/index">The Younger (Prose) Edda.</A><BR>
These Icelandic collections of epic poetry are key sources for
the study of Norse mythology.
Our plane of existence is called 'Middle Earth' in this mythology.
Tolkien also took many of the names of key
characters from this text; particularly one sequence early on in
the <A HREF="../neu/poe/poe03">Voluspo</A>, including Gandalf, and
all of the Dwarves from <CITE>the Hobbit</CITE>.
Also found in the Eddas is the forest of Myrkwood; Bilbo's party
traversed the vast Mirkwood forest in the Hobbit.

<A HREF="../neu/ron/index">Wagner's Ring of the Niblung</A><BR>

<A HREF="../neu/vlsng/index">The Volsung Saga</A><BR>

<A HREF="../neu/nblng/index">The Nibelungenlied</A><BR>
The Volsung saga is the Icelandic version of the 
story which was later re-told in the Germanic Nibelungenlied.
This was the basis for Wagner's Ring cycle.
The cursed ring of doom is likewise a central theme of Tolkiens' mythology.

<A HREF="../neu/heim/index">Heimskringla or The Chronicle of 
the Kings of Norway</A><BR>
by Snorri Sturlson. tr. Samuel Laing [1844]<BR>

Gandalf is not only mentioned in the Voluspo,
but in the Heimskringla Sagas:
Gandalf was the name of the last king to rule over Alfheim,
He was killed by Harald Harfagra in the year 866.
Gandalf gets mentioned in 
<A HREF="../neu/heim/02ynglga">The Ynglinga Saga</A>,
<A HREF="../neu/heim/03halfdn">Halfdan, the Black Saga</A>,
and
<A HREF="../neu/heim/04harfgr">Harald Harfager's Saga</A>.

<span class="c_t"><A HREF="../neu/asbeo">Beowulf [Anglo Saxon]</A></span> &emsp; <span class="c_b">The original monster story, in the original Old English</span>.
Tolkien was a distinguished scholar of Middle and Old English.
The Beowulf saga is one of the treasures of this branch of literature,
and Grendel, the monster of this tale, is a prototype for many of the
darker creatures that populate Middle Earth.

tr. Lady <span class="c_a">Charlotte Guest</span> [<span class="c_d">1877</span>] &emsp; <span class="c_b">The Original Red Book.</span>
Among the sources for Tokien's languages was Welsh, and the Welsh
stories of the 'Red Book of Hergest' appear to have also
had an influence on the narratives
of Tolkien's fictional 'Red Book of Westmarch'.

<A HREF="../neu/eng/fq/index">The Faerie Queene</A>,

by Mary Macleod [1916] &emsp; <span class="c_b">The Faerie Queene is one of the wellsprings of modern Fantasy writing.</span>
Spenser, like Tolkien, did not simply retell classical or medieval stories.
He used similar themes and elements but put the pieces together
in an entirely new way, constructing an invented reality with a consistent
internal logic.
