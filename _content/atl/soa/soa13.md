# The Manus

Some reference to the very mystical subject of the Manus is a necessary
preliminary to the consideration of the origin of a Root Race. In
Transaction No. 26, of the London Lodge, reference was made to the work
done by these very exalted Beings, which embraces not only the planning
of the types of the whole Manvantara, but the superintending the
formation and education of each Root Race in turn. The following
quotation refers to these arrangements: "There are also Manus whose duty
it is to act in a similar way for each Root Race on each Planet of the
Round, the Seed Manu planning the improvement in type which each
successive Root Race inaugurates, and the Root Manu actually incarnating
amongst the new Race as a leader and teacher to direct the development
and ensure the improvement."

The way in which the necessary segregation of the picked specimens is
effected by the Manu in charge, and his subsequent care of the growing
community, may be dealt with in a future Transaction. The merest
reference to the mode of procedure is all that is necessary here.

It was of course from one of the sub-races of the Third Root Race on the
continent which is spoken of as Lemuria, that the segregation was
effected which was destined to produce the Fourth Root Race.

Following where necessary the history of the Race through the four
periods represented by the four maps, it is proposed to divide the
subject under the following headings:

1\. Origin and territorial location of the different sub-races.

2\. The political institutions they respectively evolved.

3\. Their emigrations to other parts of the world.

4\. The arts and sciences they developed.

5\. The manners and customs they adopted.

6\. The rise and decline amongst them of religious ideas.
