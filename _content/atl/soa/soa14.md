# The Sub-Races

The names of the different sub-races must first be given--

1\. Rmoahal.

2\. Tlavatli.

3\. Toltec.

4\. First Turanian.

5\. Original Semite.

6\. Akkadian.

7\. Mongolian.

Some explanation is necessary as to the principle on which these names
are chosen. Wherever modern ethnologists have discovered traces of one
of these sub-races, or even identified a small part of one, the name
they have given to it is used for the sake of simplicity, but in the
case of the first two sub-races there are hardly any traces left for
science to seize upon, so the names by which they called themselves have
been adopted.
