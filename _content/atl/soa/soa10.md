# Second Map Period

As will be seen from the second map the catastrophe of 800,000 years ago
caused very great changes in the land distribution of the globe. The
great continent is now shorn of its northern regions, and its remaining
portion has been still further rent. The now growing American continent
is separated by a chasm from its parent continent of Atlantis, and this
no longer comprises any of the lands now existing, but occupies the bulk
of the Atlantic basin from about 50' north to a few degrees south of the
equator. The subsidences and upheavals in other parts of the world have
also been considerable--the British Islands for example, now being part
of a huge island which also embraces the Scandinavian peninsula, the
North of France, and all the intervening and some of the surrounding
seas. The dimensions of the remains of Lemuria it will be observed, have
been further curtailed, while Europe, Africa and America have received
accretions of territory.
