<p>2. When a boy is twelve years old he must devote one day in seven to learning how to use his weapons.</p>  
<p>3. As soon as he is perfect in the use of them they are to be given to him, and he is to be admitted as a warrior.</p>  
<p>4. After serving as a warrior three years, he may become a citizen, and may have a vote in the election of the headman.</p>  
<p>5. When he has been seven years a voter he then may have a vote for the chief or king, and may be himself elected.</p>  
<p>6. Every year he must be re-elected.</p>  
<p>7. Except the king, all other officials are re-eligible who act according to Frya's laws.</p>  
<p>8. No king may be in office more than three years, in order that the office may not be permanent.</p>  
<p>9. After an interval of seven years he may be elected again.</p>  
<p>10. If the king is killed by the enemy, his nearest relative may be a candidate to succeed. him.</p>  
<p>11. If he dies a natural death, or if his period of service has expired, he shall not be succeeded by any blood relation nearer than the fourth degree.</p>  
<p>12. Those who fight with arms are not men of counsel, therefore no king must bear arms. His wisdom must be his weapon, and the love of his warriors his shield.</p>
