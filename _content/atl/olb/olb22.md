### <span class="smallcaps">How the Bad Time came.</span>

During the whole summer the sun had been hid behind the clouds, as if
unwilling to look upon the earth. There was perpetual calm, and the damp
mist hung like a wet sail over the houses and the marshes. The air was
heavy and oppressive, and in men's hearts was neither joy nor
cheerfulness. In the midst of this stillness the earth began to tremble
as if she was dying. The mountains opened to vomit forth fire and
flames. Some sank into the bosom of the earth, and in other places
mountains rose out of the plain. Aldland <span
id="fr_14"></span>[†](#fn_14), called by the seafaring people, Atland,
disappeared, and the wild waves rose so high over hill and dale that
everything was buried in the sea. Many people were swallowed up by the
earth, and others who had escaped the fire perished in the water.

It was not only in Finda's land that the earth vomited fire, but also in
Twiskland (Germany). Whole forests were burned one after the other, and
when the wind blew from that quarter our land was covered with ashes.
Rivers changed their course, and at their mouths new islands were formed
of sand and drift.

During three years this continued, but at length it ceased, and forests
became visible. Many countries were submerged, and in other places land
rose above the sea, and the wood was destroyed through the half of
Twiskland (Germany). Troops of Finda's people came and settled in the
empty places. Our dispersed people were exterminated or made slaves.
Then watchfulness was doubly impressed upon us, and time taught us that
union is force.
