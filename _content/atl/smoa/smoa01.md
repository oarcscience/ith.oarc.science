### FOREWORD

Atlantis, "the submerged island," some speak of it as a continent, which
for unnumbered generations has been considered a myth, must now be
accepted by fair-minded archeologists and other scientists as a proven
fact that such an island at one time did exist.

The wonderful amount of material, especially fossils of different kinds,
relating to the island of Atlantis that were gathered by the
Schliemanns, father and son, noted archeologists who devoted their lives
to proving that such an island really did once exist. Other scientists
of note working independently, or cooperating with the Schliemanns, have
added their acquirements to the proof.

In his majestic and poetical language Selestor, to whom we are indebted
for the contents of this book, has pictured for us the highly civilized
state of Atlantis’ inhabitants, that in several sciences were even
farther advanced than our nation is today, especially in mentonomy—a
study of the mind.
