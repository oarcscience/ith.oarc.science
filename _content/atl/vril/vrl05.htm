<P>I REMAINED in this unconscious state, as I afterwards learned, for many days, even for some weeks, according to our computation of time. When I recovered I was in a strange room, my host and all his family were gathered round me, and to my utter amaze my host's daughter accosted me in my own language with but a slightly foreign accent.</P>
<P>"How do you feel?" she asked.</P>
<P>It was some moments before I could overcome my surprise enough to falter out, "You know my language? How? Who and what are you?"</P>
<P>My host smiled and motioned to one of his sons, who then took from a table a number of thin metallic sheets on which were traced drawings of various figures--a house, a tree, a bird, a man, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In these designs I recognised my own style of drawing. Under each figure was written the name of it in my language, and in my writing; and in another handwriting a word strange to me beneath it.</P>
<P>Said the host, "Thus we began; and my daughter Zee, who belongs to the College of Sages, has been your instructress and ours too." </P>
<P>Zee then placed before me other metallic sheets, on which, in my writing, words first, and then sentences, were inscribed. Under each word and each sentence strange characters in another hand. Rallying my senses, I comprehended that thus a rude dictionary had been effected. Had it been done while I was dreaming? "That is enough now," said Zee, in a tone of command. "Repose and take food."</P>
