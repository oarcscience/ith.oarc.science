<P><CITE>A Dweller on Two Planets</CITE> is one of the most important texts
of the 19th Century Atlantis canon.
The book was 'channeled' by Frederick S. Oliver.
Oliver was born in Washington D.C. in 1866 and came to Yreka, California,
with his parents when he was two years old.
Yreka is just north of Mount Shasta, a huge dormant volcanic peak in Northern
California.</P>
<P>
Oliver started to write this book at the age of eighteen, in 1883-4,
while surveying the boundaries of his family's mining claim.
He found himself writing uncontrollably in his notebook.
He ran home in terror, where he sat down and let his hand write.
These automatic writing spells continued for several years; he would
write a few pages at a time.
He completed writing this book in 1886,
and died at the age of 33 in 1899.
</P>
<P>
<CITE>A Dweller on Two Planets</CITE> was finally published in 1905, by
his mother Mary Elizabeth Manley-Oliver.
There are two editions which are substantially the same,
except for a different set of typographical errors and hyphens
(although curiously the page numbering in both is identical).
The first edition, published in 1905, was reprinted
in 1974 by Rudolf Steiner Books; the second, published in 1920 by
the Poseid Publishing Company, Los Angeles, CA,
was reprinted in 1964 by Health Research.
The 1920 version was used as the basis for this etext, as it was
printed more legibly.
</P>
<P>
<CITE>A Dweller on Two Planets</CITE> would be a
<I>tour de force</I> for a teenager
from rural California in the post-Gold Rush period.
Although as a literary work it is weak in many ways, the details of the
narrative reveal a well-read and highly intelligent, if inexperienced, author.
The plot and pacing is irregular; the characterizations are poorly
conceived, and there are far too many melodramatic turns and
plot elements left dangling.
However, since this is a novel of ideas, these shortcoming should not
detract from the enjoyment of the book.</P>
<P>
The real brilliance of this book is as a work of speculative fiction,
particularly in the depiction of the high technology of Atlantis,
and the afterlife.
The book goes into great detail about antigravity, mass transit,
the employment of 'dark-side' energy (which today would be
called 'zero point energy'), and
devices such as voice-operated typewriters.
The cigar-shaped, highly maneuverable Atlantean flying machines,
or <I>vailx</I>, have an eerie resemblance to 20th Century UFO reports.
The personalized heavens, almost like virtual realities,
are unforgettable and very compelling.
</P>
<P>
This book is openly acknowledged as source material for many
new age belief systems, including the once-popular "<A HREF="../../eso/index.htm#iam">I AM</A>" movement (whose founder, Guy Ballard, <A HREF="../../eso/um/index">plagiarized</A> extensively from this book),
the Lemurian Fellowship,
and Elizabeth Claire Prophet.
According to Shirley MacLaine,
<CITE>A Dweller on Two Planets</CITE> jumped out of a bookshelf into her hands
in a New Age bookstore in Hong Kong (and obviously had an big influence
on her subsequently).
This book is the source of the idea that there is a
hidden sanctuary of ascended Lemurian masters under Mount Shasta.
This book was also probably the first to propose the concept of
of 'America as the modern Atlantis', which was later adopted by
writers such as Manly P. Hall.
</P>
<P>
The Lemurian Fellowship published a sequel in 1940
titled <I>An Earth Dweller's Return</I>.
This rehashed the plot of the original, and had some radically different
maps, which I've included on the <A HREF="dtp04">maps page</A>.
