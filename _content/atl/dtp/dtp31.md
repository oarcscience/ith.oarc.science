the "gold-fever," which yet lingers in that region of once famed mines;
lingers, though it be now A. D. 1890. Away up on a mountain's side with
pick, pan and shovel he has camped where a little gold may always be
found; where hope whispers he may find a "pile" some time and--fortune.

valleys lie hidden under a pile of smoke. But the miner on the mountain
is above it all, and as he labors looks out over the undulating surface
of the silvery, smoky. ocean, down below. He sees a strange sight. No
waves disturb this sea, which, nearly a mile deep, extends away beyond
scope of vision. Two or three islands dot its expanse; these are all
that is left to see of lofty mountain peaks whose bases are hidden.
Perchance the words "smoke-ocean" seem figurative. Look heavenward from
its bottom down in the valleys; the sun, appearing like a globe of

nine thousand feet.
