# CHAPTER II

### JOB xxxviii:7

Contemplating the victory in us of the Father, we chanted a song in
answer to that of the Sons of God who were our fellows. Perfect at last,
in rapport with all the law fulfilled, karmaless, immortal, beside
Jesus, no more need to incarnate, Life was ended, but Being just
commenced. Paradoxical? In all the aeons of time we had Life, but Being,
which hath no

beginning, neither end, and is not under the dominion of Time, every ego
hath ever from the Father. But Life hath beginning, so also it must have
end; it hath end. If its conditions are strong enough to enchain for
aye, then the soul is diverted from its ego to the tracks of Life, and
is then heritor of death. Only if a soul forfeit not to Life its hold on
Being-on its ego-shall it not die. Sin is the error of turning from
Being unto Life, whereof the shadow is death. The soul that sinneth and
turneth not away from finite life and the conditions thereof, it shall
die.

Down all the realms of light echoed the paeans of praise, as when the
"Morning stars sang together and the Sons of God shouted for joy."
