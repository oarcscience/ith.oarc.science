<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">PREFACE</H1>
<P>This work on Sacred Symbols has been compiled at the suggestion of the late Irving Putnam who felt and assured me that such a work would be appreciated by the public.</P>
<P>The kindly way in which the public have received my first two books on Mu calls for my most sincere thanks and makes me feel that my life's work has not been in vain.</P>
<P>In this work I have given my <I>personal</I> view why religion is in such a chaotic state today. There are over three hundred religions and sects and only <I>One God</I>.</P>
