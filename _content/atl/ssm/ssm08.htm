<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">SYMBOLS USED IN RELIGIOUS TEACHINGS</H1>
<P>THE symbols which were used in the religious teachings of early man are popularly known as the Sacred Symbols.</P>
<P>When symbols were first used it was to concentrate man's mind on the Infinite One, so that by keeping his eyes on the symbol no outside sights or sounds might call off his attention from the object of worship. Man was most carefully taught that the symbol itself was not to be worshipped; the symbol was only a picture to keep his mind from wandering. He was carefully taught that there was only One Deity, but that One Deity had many attributes which looked after health and strength, rain and sunshine, crops; in fact, after the whole welfare of mankind.</P>
<P>In the beginning three symbols only were used. When these were understood, they were compounded and others added, and as time grew so did the number of symbols, also their complexity, until we come down to Egypt about 3,000 or 4,000 years ago, when there was such a riot of symbols scarcely one temple understood the meaning of half the symbols used in another.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_119"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 119</FONT></A></P>
<P>The three original symbols which I have referred to are: <I>The Circle</I>, <I>The Equilateral Triangle</I> and <I>The Square</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_11900"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/11900.jpg"></P>
<P>THE CIRCLE.--The Circle is a picture of the Sun and was the symbol of the Infinite One. As it embraced all of His attributes it was the Monotheistic Symbol. Being the Monotheistic Symbol it was considered the Most Sacred Symbol of all. According to legend, the Sun was selected for this symbol because it was the most powerful object that came within the sight and understanding of man at that time.</P>
<P>The circle having no beginning and no ending also symbolized:--everlasting, without end and infinity.</P>
<P>Before very long it is shown that the circle was being used to symbolize so many things that it became necessary to specialize the circle when using it as the Monotheistic Symbol of the Deity. The Nagas made an addition by placing a dot in the center of the circle. The Uighurs added a smaller circle within, making it a double circle.</P>
<I><P>Papyrus Anana</I>: This is one of the most beautiful Egyptian writings that I have come across. Anana was chief scribe and king's companion to the gentle Seti II about 1320 B. C.</P>
<P>"Behold! is it not written in this roll? Read, ye who</P>
<P><A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A></P>
<P>shall find in the days unborn, if your gods have given you the skill. Read, O children of the future, and learn the secrets of the past, which to you is so far away, and yet in truth so near.</P>
<P>"Men do not live once only and then depart hence forever; they live many times in many places, though not always in this world. That between each life there is a veil of darkness.</P>
<P>"The doors will open at last, and show us all the chambers through which our feet wandered from the beginning.</P>
<P>"Our religion teaches us that we live on eternally. Now eternity having no end, can have had no beginning--<I>it is a circle</I>; therefore, if one be true, namely that we live on forever, it would seem that the other must be true also: namely, that we <I>have always lived</I>.</P>
<P>"To men's eyes God has many faces, and each one swears that the one he sees is the only true God. Yet they are all wrong, for all are true.</P>
<P>"Our Kas, which are our spiritual selves, show them to us in various ways. Drawing from the infinite well of wisdom that is hidden in the being of every man, gives us glimpses of the truth, as they give us, who are instructed, <I>power to work marvels</I>.</P>
<P>"The Spirit should not be judged by the body or the god by his house.</P>
<P>"Among the Egyptians the Scarabaeus Beetle is no god, but a symbol of the Creator, because it rolls a ball of mud between its feet and sets therein its eggs to hatch</P>
<P><A NAME="page_121"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 121</FONT></A></P>
<P>as the Creator rolls the world around which seems to be round causing it to produce life.</P>
<P>"All gods send their gift of love upon this earth, without which it would cease to be. My faith teaches me more clearly perhaps than yours, that life does not end with death, and therefore that love, being life's soul, must endure while it endures.</P>
<P>"The strength of the invisible tie will bind two souls together long after the world is dead.</P>
<P>"The spirits or souls of one incarnation possibly may meet again in another incarnation, and may be drawn together as if by a magnet but for what cause neither knows.</P>
<P>"Man comes into being many times, yet knows nothing of his past lives; except occasionally some daydream or a thought carries him back to some circumstance of a previous incarnation. He cannot, however, determine in his mind when or where the circumstance occurred only that it is something familiar. In the end, however, all of his various pasts will reveal themselves."</P>
<P>Various forms and modifications of the Sun as Ra are to be found in the ancient writings.</P>

<I><P>Fig. 3</I>. A subsequent change made by the Uighurs.</P>
<I><P>Fig. 4</I>. Part of the headdress of some of the Egyptian gods.</P>
<I><P>Fig. 5</I>. This generally appears as a red sphere on tops of pillars and monuments to the dead.</P>
<P>The foregoing Suns are all the Monotheistic Symbol of the Deity and among the ancients was called Ra.</P>
<P>I will now take some pictures of the Sun appearing in ancient writings as the celestial orb and not as Ra the Monotheistic symbol.</P>
<I><P>Fig. A</I>. Is an eight-ray'd Sun. This was Mu's symbol on her Royal Escutcheon. The name in the Motherland of the Sun as the celestial orb was--Kin. In Egypt the name was--Horus. In Greece--Apollo and in Babylonia--Belmarduk, et cetera.</P>
<I><P>Fig. B</I>. A Sun with rays all around it represented the Sun at his meridian in mid-heavens.</P>
<I><P>Fig. C</I>. A rising Sun with rays, half the orb above the horizon, was the symbol on the escutcheon of a colonial empire of Mu.</P>
<I><P>Fig. D</I>. A Sun with half the orb above the horizon without rays had a dual symbolization. It was the symbol of the setting Sun. It was also the symbol of a colony of Mu, before it became a colonial empire.</P>
<I><P>Fig. E</I>. The Lands of the West in darkness. The three-pointed figure is Mu's numeral symbol as the Lands of the West. The Sun above without rays says that no light reaches Mu--she is in darkness. A vignette from the "Book of the Dead."</P>
<P><A NAME="page_124"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 124</FONT></A></P>
<I><P>Fig. F</I>. The Sacrifice of Mu. The Lotus above is Mu's floral symbol; being shown withered and dying it symbolizes Mu as being dead. A rayless Sun stands between Mu and the altar; therefore Mu is dead in the region of darkness--on the altar as a sacrifice.</P>
<I><P>Fig. G</I>. "Peaks only remain above the water." Mu is here depicted as being dead and in darkness with only points or peaks remaining above the water. Kin no longer shines upon her. Vignette from the Egyptian "Book of the Dead."</P>
<P>THE EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE.--The equilateral triangle has a dual significance, dependent upon where and how it is used. Its origin dates back as solving to primitive man the emersion of the three lands which formed the Land of Mu--the Lands of the West.</P>
<P>The Lands of the West consisted of a huge continental island and two small ones, separated from the big one by narrow seas, called in the Egyptian "canals." Tradition says that the big continental island was first emerged and that the two small islands were subsequently emerged at different periods. It was to explain this phenomenon, of the three lands coming up at different periods, that the triangle was selected.</P>
<P>The equilateral triangle has three equal sides joined to one another and forming a single unbroken line without ends.</P>
<P>It was pointed out to primitive man that it was the same Creator that raised all three lands, each land being raised by separate commands: Thus there were not</P>
<P><A NAME="page_125"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 125</FONT></A></P>
<P>three Creators but only one. Apparently, to make it more understandable, each was raised by a separate attribute.</P>
<P>This formed the first Triune Godhead whereon have been built the enormous number of Pantheons that have permeated all ages. The conception of a Triune Godhead has been handed down from the beginning of religious teachings and still remains with us.</P>
<P>An equilateral triangle symbolized the Creator, and, as the Creator dwells in Heaven, the triangle must necessarily symbolize heaven also; for, where the Lord is, there is Heaven.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_12500"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/12500.jpg"></P>
<P>I find this verified among the Egyptian symbols, as the glyph shows. Here we find the Monotheistic Symbol of the Deity within the triangle-within Heaven. Wherever or whenever the equilateral triangle is met with in ancient writings or inscriptions, it is either in reference to the Triune Godhead, or Heaven, or both.</P>
<P>At the time of Confucius, the Chinese Sage, about 500 B. C., in place of the triangle the Chinese used a glyph in the form of the present-day capital Y. This they called: "the Great Term," "the Great Unite," "the Great Y." "The Y has neither body nor shape, all that has body and shape was made by that which has no shape. The Great Term or the Great Unite comprehends</P>
<P><A NAME="page_126"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 126</FONT></A></P>
<P>three--One in three-and three in One."</P>
<P>THE FOUR-SIDED SQUARE.--The Four-sided Square completes the trilogy of the first and original Sacred Symbols.</P>
<P>The square was selected as a conventional symbol of the earth for apparently two reasons:--To prevent it from being confounded with the Sun whose picture was a circle; and for the purpose of teaching to primitive man the cardinal points North, South, East and West. Being drawn as a square gave the earth "four corners" which were to be explained as teaching developed. Later the four corners became the positions of the "Four Great Pillars," one of the many names given to the Four Great Primary Forces which emanate from the Creator. These Forces first evolved law and order out of chaos and darkness; then created the bodies of the Universe and all therein. They now continue and uphold the work that they have accomplished, hence the name of "Pillars" having been given to them. The next step was to appoint keepers for the Pillars. These were known as the Genii.</P>
<P>Apparently, when the meanings of the foregoing three symbols were learnt by primitive man, his next lesson was the compounding of these three symbols.</P>
<P>TRIANGLE WITH THREE STARS.--Fig 1. The triangle here symbolizes Heaven. The three stars within symbolize the three members of the Triune Godhead. The Triune Godhead dwells in Heaven.</P>
<P>TRIANGLE WITH FIVE STARS.--Fig 2. The triangle</P>
<P><A NAME="page_127"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 127</FONT></A></P>
<P>symbolizes Heaven. The five stars within symbolize the full Godhead of Five, namely, the Deity and his Four Great Primary or Creative Forces. The Deity with His Great Forces dwells in Heaven.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_12700"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/12700.jpg"></P>
<P>A TRIANGLE SURMOUNTING A SQUARE. Fig. 3. This glyph is composed of the four-sided square the symbol of the earth, with the triangle symbol of Heaven surmounting it; thus showing Heaven above Earth. Above, in this case, does not refer to altitude in any way. It means: that Heaven is on a higher plane, where life is more perfect than here on earth. Thus this symbol depicts Heaven as being more perfect than earth, more blissful and happy.</P>
<P>A TRIANGLE SURMOUNTING A SQUARE AND THE TRIANGLE HAVING THREE STARS WITHIN.--Fig. 4. In this symbol there is an addition of three stars placed within the triangle, symbolizing that the Triune Godhead is in Heaven, above the Earth. This symbol is to be seen on the end wall of an end room of an ancient temple in Uxmal, Yucatan. This temple has been called "The Temple of Sacred Mysteries" because there is an inscription on a wall stating that the people came from <FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_128"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 128</FONT></A></P>
<P>Mu and brought the Sacred Mysteries with them. In the room where this symbol appears, the postulant received his second degree.</P>
<P>The temple was built about 11,500 to 12,000 years ago as shown by an inscription on its walls which states, "that this temple was erected as a monument to Mu."</P>
<P>A TRIANGLE SURMOUNTING A SQUARE AND THE TRIANGLE HAVING FIVE STARS WITHIN.--Fig. 5. As previously stated five stars symbolize the full Godhead of Five--The Deity and His Four Great Primary Forces. This symbol is to be seen on the end of the wall of the opposite room to the one previously mentioned in the Temple of Sacred Mysteries at Uxmal. Here the postulant received his third degree, and was then prepared to enter the Holy of Holies.</P>
<P>This ends the compounding of the three original symbols.</P>
<P>The Sacred Symbols:--The circle, triangle, square and pentagon became the foundation of the wonderful geometrical. knowledge attained in Mu and thoroughly entwined religion with science.</P>
<P>SYMBOLS OF MORTALITY.--A short space above the lintel of the entrance to the sanctuary of the Temple of Sacred Mysteries at Uxmal, Yucatan, is a cornice that surrounds the whole edifice. On it are sculptured the symbols of mortality which are many times repeated. The emblems of mortality occupied a very prominent place in ancient religion. It was extensively used by the Mayas, Quiches, Egyptians, Hindus and Babylonians</P>
<P><A NAME="page_129"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 129</FONT></A></P>
<P>and was found in the writings and inscriptions of all ancient lands.</P>
<P>The emblems of mortality were used in the ancient religious ceremonies to impress upon the postulant what his end would be and the end of all mortality, and with this end in view impress upon him constantly the necessity of living a life that would bring no terrors when the soul releases itself from the body to pass into the world beyond.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_12900"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/12900.jpg"></P>
<P>The Egyptian was a reflex of the Maya, and the Maya the teachings direct from the Motherland so that, from Egypt, we can get the original ceremonies with but immaterial changes. In the temple within the Great Pyramid was found in one of the chambers a sarcophagus with the emblems of mortality arranged alongside of it. The postulant was placed in the sarcophagus; here he was reminded that after his soul leaves his mortal body another life awaits him. This ceremony persists with the Freemasons today.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_130"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 130</FONT></A></P>
<P>The TAU (<I>Ta-oo</I>).--The Tau is not only one of the most interesting, but it is one of the most ancient symbols, as it. is found repeatedly in the oldest writings of the Motherland.</P>
<P>It is the symbol of both resurrection and emersion. Emersion is really only a resurrection of land. I know of no country on the face of the earth today that has not been under water several times-thus each time it was emersed it was resurrected.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_13000"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/13000.jpg" ALT="<I>The Tau</I>"><BR><FONT SIZE="-3"><I>The Tau</I></FONT></P></P>
<P>The name today is as it was in the Motherland--Tau; it was Tau then and it is Tau today. It is one of the very few words that has persisted through all time without a change in any way. The name means "the stars which bring the water." Ta--stars, and ha--water. The Marquesans today pronounce it "Ta-ha" (the pure Motherland pronunciation).</P>
<P>The Tau is the picture of the constellation, the Southern Cross, the most gorgeous group of stars appearing south of the equator. When the Southern Cross appeared at a certain angle over Mu, the rainy season commenced. The parched, dry land responded to the moisture from above. Leaves, flowers and fruit sprang forth upon tree and shrub. Seeds in the ground, that had been lying dead, germinated and sprang forth into life, enriching</P>
<P><A NAME="page_131"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 131</FONT></A></P>
<P>the land with golden grain. Mu became the land of plenty. Life had been resurrected.</P>

<IMG SRC="img/13400.jpg"></P>
<P>THE DOUBLE TRIANGLE.--A pair of triangles bound together at their base, thus forming a double triangle, was the ancient symbol for an offering, and often appeared on the altar where offerings were made. These altars were generally in the form of the Tau, or had a Tau carved on the face of the altar. The rain brought by the Tau made offerings possible. These offerings, generally, were in the form of flowers or fruit, or products from the fields.</P>
<P>Before the destruction of Mu, sacrifices were unknown. Sacrifice was a word coined to describe the awful destruction of the beloved Motherland.</P>
<P>The general position in which the double triangle was placed was directly under the arms of the Tau, and in the ancient ritual these are supposed to say or read, "Place thine offering upon this altar."</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_13401"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/13401.jpg"></P>
<P>THE TWO-SIDED SQUARE The two-sided square is known among the Masonic brotherhood as the two-sided or Mason's square. It is a very ancient glyph,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_135"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 135</FONT></A></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_13500"></A>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_136"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 136</FONT></A></P>
<P>reading "Builder," and apparently was first used in the crosses symbolizing The Sacred Four when the name of the Great Builders of the Universe was given to them. This glyph was placed within the arm or loop of the cross which symbolized The Four Primary Forces, thus naming them "Builders."</P>
<P>The two-sided square is on many of Niven's Mexican tablets. I am giving a page of examples. In all of these tablets they are referring to the Sacred Four as "The Great Builders of the Universe." Down to the time of Mu's destruction, this symbol was used only to express builders as the name of the Creative Forces.</P>
<P>When, however, thousands of years afterwards, we enter Egypt, we find this symbol with a new vestment and a new name. Here it became the symbol of justice and uprightness.</P>
<P>It has always been thought that this symbol originated in Egypt but it goes back thousands of years beyond the commencement of Egyptian history. The two-sided square is a symbol which is constantly found in the Book of the Dead, also in various Egyptian papyrii. All seats where either gods or goddesses are shown sitting are composed of the two-sided square. In the Great Hall of Truth where Osiris is shown sitting in judgment his seat is composed of the two-sided square.</P>
<P>The people of Egypt were taught that this symbol of the two-sided square represented: "Right from wrong, to act on the square, to act rightly, to act justly, to act truthfully according to Maat." To only the initiated and</P>

<P><A NAME="page_138"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 138</FONT></A></P>
<P>the priesthood of Egypt was the actual meaning of this symbol known. This is shown by the title and symbol of the god Ptah. Two of his titles were "The Divine Artificer" and "The Divine Builder"; accompanying these titles was the two-sided square. In all of the designs of Egyptian Pillars, they symbolize the ancient and true meaning.</P>
<P>THE CUBE.--This symbol is especially interesting to Arch Masons. It is found in the 64th Chapter of the Book of the Dead which is the oldest and one of the most important chapters in this sacred volume, having been written by Thoth at Sais at the commencement of Egyptian history about 14,000 B. C. Translations of it vary somewhat but not materially. The following are some of the translations.</P>
<I><P>M. Paul Pierret</I> translated one of the sentences from the Turin Copy as: "I am yesterday, and I know tomorrow, I am able to be born again."</P>
<I><P>London Papyrus</I> reads: "I am yesterday, today and tomorrow."</P>
<I><P>The Ruberic</I> says: "This chapter was found in the city of Khemennu upon a block of iron from the South which had been inlaid with letters of real Lapis Lazuli, under the foot of God during the reign of his majesty the King of the North and the South Men-Kan-Ra triumphant by the royal son Heru-Ta-Ta-f triumphant. He found it when he was journeying about to make an investigation of the temples. One Neskit was with him who was diligent in making him understand it, and he</P>
<P><A NAME="page_139"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 139</FONT></A></P>
<P>brought it to the King as a wonderful object. When he saw that thing of mystery which had never been seen or looked upon." London Papyrus dating 3733 B. C. <I>The cube</I> is what was found.</P>

<I><P>M. Paul Pierret's</I> translation from the Turin Papyrus: "This chapter was found out in Hermopolis on a brick of burnt clay, written in blue, under the feet of the god <I>Thoth</I>. The finding out at the time of King Menekara was made by Prince Har-titi-f in this place when he was travelling to inspect the temples. It related in itself a hymn which transported him into ecstasy. He brought it to the King's chariot as soon as he saw <I>what was drawn on the cube</I>--a great mystery."</P>
<I><P>Papyrus Mes-em-neter</I> dated 4266 B. C.: "This chapter was found in the foundation of a plinth of the shrine of the Divine Hennu Boat by the chief mason in the time of the King of the North and the South Hesepti triumphant, and it is there directed that it shall be recited only by one who is ceremoniously clean and pure." </P>

<P>The figure shows a central circle enclosed within a pair of triangles crossed and interwoven. Again the two triangles are enclosed within an outer circle which leaves twelve divisions between the two circles. The central symbol, the circle, is the monotheistic symbol of the Deity; the triangle of heaven, and the outer circle the Universe. The twelve divisions between the two</P>

<P>circles are gates, "The twelve gates to heaven." Each gate was a virtue, and these twelve gates must be opened by the twelve virtues before heaven could be entered. Among the twelve virtues were first of all Love; then followed Faith, Hope, Charity, et cetera.</P>
<P>THE FEATHER.--The feather is another of the very prominent Ancient Sacred Symbols; it symbolized Truth.</P>
<P>Three feathers adorned the Crown of Mu. Three feathers were the ornament on the head piece of Ra Mu, the King High Priest of Mu--Niven's Mexican Stone Tablet No. 1780.</P>
<P>We find feathers as symbols among the Mayas, the difference in color denoting the rank of the wearer. In Mu yellow was the color for royalty, blue for the priesthood and red for soldiers and nobility. In these ancient times yellow appears to have been the royal color throughout the world. A dark blue is the mourning color in the Orient today. Research shows that this color was adopted when Mu was sacrificed, and corresponds with the color of her burial shroud--the blue waters of the Pacific Ocean.</P>
<P>The feathers worn by the North American Indian today is a relic which he has inherited from his forefathers. Whether they know the original meaning of the feather, I cannot say. When on the warpath, however, they color the ends of their feathers red, corresponding with the red feathers of the soldiers and nobility of Mu.</P>

<P>about the feather. In the early Egyptian times, as in Mu, a straight feather was used. About the time of Menes a curled ostrich feather was used on all new symbolizations. The curled feather is in the headdress of Osiris and Maat, and in the Great Hall of Truth an ostrich feather is shown as being weighed against the heart of the deceased, the feather symbolizing Truth.</P>
<P>Legend says that the feather was selected to symbolize Truth because a puff of wind blows it away. Truth is just as liable and easy to be frightened away as the feather is to be blown away.</P>
<P>The ancient name for the feather was Kukum, Ku or Kuk. Among the Mayas of North America we find a serpent called Kukul Khan which translated would be Khan--king, Kuk--feather, and ul--covered; so that a free translation would be: The King of Serpents which is covered with feathers. This corresponds with the Quiche Maya as recorded in their Sacred Book the Popol Vuh.</P>
<I><P>Pillars</I> as sacred symbols are of an extremely ancient origin. My personal opinion is they date back to the <I>first</I> temple ever erected for the worship of the Infinite One and that was more than 70,000 years ago. The Pillar is one of the multitude of symbols which symbolize the Four Great Creative Forces. They were first used at the doorway or entrance to the temple. They were specialized in their construction and shapes. From various old tablets and fallen ruins I have reconstructed a pair as they were erected 20,000 years ago.</P>

<P>The foregoing I think clearly establishes the antiquity of pillars as sacred symbols, with their shapes and meanings.</P>
<P>I shall now pass on to the Egyptians of much more recent time, taking the period of about 1,000, to 4,500 B. C.</P>
<I><P>Egyptian Pillars</I>: This is a group of pillars taken from the Book of the Dead and various Egyptian Papyrii. By these it will be seen that the Egyptians did not adhere to the patterns and details of the ancients, but rather made a display of their imagination and artistry. Pillars came to Egypt with both tides of colonists, the Eastern Line brought them and the Western Line</P>

<P><A NAME="page_149"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 149</FONT></A></P>
<P>brought them and between the two, new conceptions of what pillars ought to be developed.</P>
<P>The Egyptians called them Tat Pillars. They are, however, better known throughout the world as Totem Pillars.</P>
<P>The Egyptians called one pillar "Tat" which in their language means "in strength." The other pillar they called "Tattu" which means "to establish," and when conjoined, "In strength this place is established for ever." The Egyptians considered the figure of a Tat an emblem of strength and stability.</P>
<P>It will be noticed that all of the pillars in this group carry four horizontal bars, in this way symbolizing the Four Great Primary Forces, or, as they were more wont to call them:--"The Four Great Gods."</P>
<I><P>The entrance to Amenti</I> taken from the papyrus Anana, one of the most beautiful papyri I have ever seen. In Egyptian mythology, two Tats form the entrance to Tattu. Tattu is the gateway to the region where the mortal soul is blended with an immortal spirit and "established in the mysteries of Amenti for ever."</P>
<P>In the porch or entrance to King Solomon's Temple two special pillars were erected.</P>
<P>I Kings. Chap. 7, Verses 21-22. "And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple, and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin, and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz."</P>
<P>At the entrance of King Solomon's Temple, and at the Osirian Great Hall of Truth, two pillars were</P>

<P>erected standing perpendicularly. In each case they have identically the same meanings, language considered, with identically the same names. Beyond this the ornamentation on the pillars--lily work--are also the same: showing that King Solomon's pillars were a complete copy of the pillars at the Great Hall of Truth; and while both change the pattern of the pillars that they both retained their original meaning: that is, they symbolized the work of the Four Great Primary Forces.</P>
<I><P>North American Indian</I>: The Indians of our Northwestern states and of western Canada erect Totem Poles and hold ceremonies at their base. I have been unable to get anything about them except legend: but these legends and carvings on the Totem Poles strongly confirm the fact that the forefathers of those Indians came from Mu, and from that part of the Motherland where the bird was their symbol of the Creator.</P>
<I><P>The Maoris of New Zealand</I>: A common practice of the Maoris of New Zealand is to erect Totem Poles or Pillars at the main entrance to their villages.</P>
<I><P>The Karangs of Java</I>: Forbes in writing says:--"In Java is a tribe called Karangs, supposed to be the descendants of the aborigines of the island, whose old men and youths, four times a year repair secretly, in procession, to a sacred grove in a dense forest, the old men to worship, the youths to see and learn the mysteries of their forefathers.</P>
<P>"In this grove are the ruins of terraces laid out in</P>
<P><A NAME="page_152"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 152</FONT></A></P>
<P>quadrilateral enclosures, the boundaries of which are marked by blocks of stone, or fixed in the ground. Here and there on the terraces are prominent monuments, <I>erect pillars</I>, and especially noteworthy, <I>a pillar erect within a square</I>.</P>
<P>"Here these despised and secluded people follow the rites and customs that have been handed down to them from their forefathers through vastly remote ages (about 12,000 years) repeating with superstitious awe a litany which they do not understand or comprehend. This very litany is found in the Egyptian Book of the Dead."</P>
<I><P>The Israelites in Egypt</I>: While in Egypt the Israelites had two pillars of red brick at the entrance of their poor little temples. In many of their synagogues today, they erect two pillars at the entrance and say they symbolize the legendary pillars of fire and smoke that accompanied them during their exodus. What did their Egyptian Pillars symbolize?</P>
<I><P>Atlantis</I>: Plato the Greek philosopher informs us that:--"The people of Atlantis gathered every fifth and sixth year alternately and with sacrifices of bulls swore to observe the sacred inscriptions carved on the <I>pillars of the temple</I>."</P>

<P>THE EIGHT ROADS TO HEAVEN.--The eight Roads to Heaven was a religious symbolic teaching which I first found in the Cosmogonic Diagram of Mu which attests its great antiquity. In this Cosmogonic Diagram it was used to show man how he must live on this earth to be prepared to pass into the world beyond when his call came. The eight Roads to Heaven was not an actual conception; it was a symbolic teaching, religious in character. These special teachings were unquestionably universal, as they are found among ancient people throughout the world. Such form of teaching must have been very popular since there were so many designs of symbols for it. Every ancient people appear to have had their own idea as to what design and figure best symbolized the eight Roads to Heaven.</P>

<P>First Civilization, also carved on the stones of the North American cliff dwellers or their predecessors. The Life Symbol is a compound of two symbols. The O loop at the top symbolizes a mouth or gateway. It was from the Egyptian that the symbol of Venus, the looped cross, originated, and with its adoption a new vestment was given to it. With Venus it symbolized the triumph of the spirit over bodily matter, the soul over materialism. Venus was the Roman and Aphrodite the Greek. We find, among the Egyptian relics, that many of the symbols were very much ornamented. In the ancient writings I have only come upon plain, unornamented ones: all of the Egyptian were, however, not ornamented. As an example is the base on which the seat of Osiris rests in the Great Hall of Truth. Here it is many times repeated. Among the cliff dwellers or their predecessors, there is a tendency to curve the perpendicular member of the cross, thus <A NAME="img_15501"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/15501.jpg">, which has led many archaeologists astray, inducing them to give the glyph an erroneous meaning.</P>
<P>THE ROADWAY OF THE SOUL.--I have found in my wanderings two figures prominently placed, but never came across the name by which they are called. As they are generally found on the outside of, and on the walls and ceilings of, burial chambers, I have given them the name as shown in the above caption. Some day perhaps their correct name may be known, then this temporary name can be abandoned.</P>
<P>For many years the spiral figure, shown in cut, has</P>
<P><A NAME="page_15600"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 15600</FONT></A></P>
<P>been a puzzle to me, as it has been found all along the line of the great Uighur migration. The picture I am showing comes from New Grange, County Meath, Ireland.</P>
<P>The figure is either an explanation of the esoteric or hidden meaning of the hieratic letter N in Mu's alphabet, or the letter itself, highly embellished, I cannot say which. After a careful study of many of the writings of Mu in which the letter N appears, I find a slight variation in them. Sometimes they are formed thus <A NAME="img_15600"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/15600.jpg">, sometimes thus <A NAME="img_15601"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/15601.jpg">. The difference is that in one the ends are left open--in the other they are closed--there are no ends. As there are no ends, the figure becomes a continuous line, returning to the starting point, and proceeding on as it can find no place to stop. It is therefore equivalent to a circle, which has no beginning or end.</P>
<P>In the picture shown from New Grange it will be seen the spirals have no ends, but when the center is reached the line returns on itself. There is no starting point in either of the spirals and no end given, consequently, these spirals are also the equivalent of a circle.</P>
<P>In the Sacred Writings of Mu we are told man's soul lives on until finally it reaches the source of its origin. Ana., 1320 B. C., Egyptian Papyrus: "If we live on we must continue for ever, and if we continue for ever, like the circle and eternity, man had no beginning."</P>
<P>Here we find two ancient references to man's soul</P>
<P><A NAME="page_157"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 157</FONT></A></P>
<P>having no end nor beginning. These spirals have no end or beginning and are generally found, associated with the passing on of the soul, in burial chambers of the material body. A careful study of the symbol and where and under what circumstances it is found leads me to the belief that:--These hitherto unreadable spiral symbols give the hidden meaning of the hieratic letter N--Mu's alphabet; that they are intended to depict the continuance of the soul from one cycle to another, from one incarnation to another, eventually ending whence it came. In the New Grange picture which I have shown there are three spirals all running into each other without an end. I take it that the third spiral is meant to indicate the passing of the soul into the world beyond or maybe to some other body in the Universe specially prepared to receive it.</P>
<P>On the walls of New Grange there are carved other symbols, spirals, squares, zig-zags, et cetera.</P>
<P><A NAME="img_15700"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/15700.jpg">, A spiral with an end pointing to the right is an ancient Uighur symbol meaning, "going to somewhere." It is also found in Mexico and among the North American Indians.</P>

<IMG SRC="img/15802.jpg"> A zig-zag or herring-bone with the points defined is the universal ancient symbol for a tank fire, an abyss of molten fire without flames, prominent in Egyptian symbology.</P>

No draughtsman ever draws these ancient figures <I>as they are identically shown</I> on the stones. This has been my experience.

<P>THE TREE AND THE SERPENT.--This work would seem incomplete to me if I omitted the Tree and the Serpent. Innumerable legends about the Serpent and the Tree are found in religions. The tree is invariably called "Tree of Life," and the serpent entwining it, "Tempter," or whatever else signifies Satan. The Tree and the Serpent started as a legend, then gradually drifted into myths: the climax being reached when the tree was credited with its fantastic crop of apples. These apples became necessary to carry out a myth for how otherwise could old Satan tempt Eve to eat apples and Eve tempt Adam? They were needed to accomplish the downfall of Adam. By this action poor woman has been made the cause of every ill befalling mankind. It is a monumental piece of cowardice on the part of man to put that responsibility on the shoulders of the woman. The irony is that a man and not a woman was to blame. The Eve alibi has stood for nearly 3,000 years but it must now be set aside. Had Ezra been able to read correctly the symbols which appeared in the writings of Moses, he would have given a very different version of the wily old Serpent and the Tree of Life.</P>
<P>The small vignette comes from the Sacred Inspired Writings of Mu. These Sacred Writings teach that there <I>is only one real life on this earth</I>, which is the <I>Soul of Man</I>, and which these writings sometimes call <I>The Man</I> also <I>The Inner Man</I>. It was taught that man's</P>
<P><A NAME="page_160"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 160</FONT></A></P>
<P>material body was only a temporary habitation. All other forms which are known to us as life are of a temporary nature also. They are taken from the earth and to earth they must return. Of all the forms of earthly creations, man only had an imperishable part which survived the material body and lived on for ever; therefore <I>Man's Soul</I> was the only <I>true</I> life on earth.</P>
<P>Man <I>first</I> appeared on earth in the <I>Land of Mu</I>; therefore the <I>first actual life</I> on earth appeared in <I>Mu</I>. In these writings man is also spoken of as a fruit. Trees bear fruit, and man was the <I>first fruit</I> of a tree and the fruit was <I>life</I>. The Land of Mu was the Tree of Life. Thus Mu was symbolized as a tree--the Tree of Life.</P>
<P>In the vignette, the tree is shown as having a serpent coiled around it, thus <I>surrounding</I> the tree. It is an unadorned serpent, therefore it is Khan the symbol of Khanab, "The Great Waters," the ocean. Here it is symbolically shown that Mu was surrounded by water. Mu had no land connections with any other continental land. <I>The Serpent is the waters surrounding Mu</I>.</P>
<P>The foregoing shows and intelligently explains what the Tree of Life was, and <I>why</I> a Serpent is coiled around it. What Moses undoubtedly wrote were plain facts, in symbolical language--a symbolically written history, true in all respects. Translations, erroneous and misleading, perverted his writings.</P>
<P>THE ANCIENT MEANINGS OF CERTAIN NUMERALS.--The number 3 is now commonly called the lucky number. Why? We must go back to tradition to tell us.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_161"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 161</FONT></A></P>
<P>On one occasion, I asked the old Rishi, "Do you know why we call the numeral three, the lucky number?" His answer was, "I can only surmise; what is three the symbol of?" My answer was, "Heaven and the Triune Godhead and, yes, the numeral symbol of the Motherland of Mu." He answered: "Don't you think man was lucky to have a Motherland, and more so to know that he will not meet the fate of the Motherland?"</P>
<P>He then turned and said to me: "Four is the lucky numeral because it is the Four Great Primary Forces that have charge of us and care for our material bodies through their earthly lives and their numeral is Four. In ancient times, Four stood amongst the most revered numbers, but today it is almost--if not entirely--forgotten. Possibly the mythical teachings of modern science has much to do with this loss. As Three is looked upon as the Lucky Number, Seven is looked upon as the Sacred Number."</P>
<P>THE SACRED SEVEN.--The original sacred Seven was the Seven Great Commands of the Creator. These were given to the Four Great Primary Forces, to carry out "his will, command or wishes," thus emanating from the Creator. They are the Creative Forces of the Almighty.</P>
<P>The predilection of ancient peoples in their sacred ceremonies for the use of the numeral Seven is very great and conspicuous.</P>

<P>The ancients counted in fives to avoid mentioning ten. Ten was the numeral of the Deity; therefore too sacred to be mentioned. Ten was counted twice five, fifteen three times five and so on up to twenty.</P>
<P>I will take one more example in numerals--the number 13. Thirteen is always looked upon as unlucky especially when in connection with Friday.</P>
<P>Mu, the Motherland, was destroyed on a Friday, the 13th day of the Month of Zac (the white month). The memory of that day, the 13th, has been carried down as an unlucky day for mankind.</P>
