### Religion.

With so primitive a race of men, at the best, there was but little in
the shape of religion that they could be taught. Simple rules of conduct
and the most elementary precepts of morality were all that they were
fitted to understand or to practise. During the evolution of the seventh
sub-race, it is true that their divine instructors taught them some
primitive form of worship and imparted the knowledge of a Supreme Being
whose symbol was represented as the Sun.
