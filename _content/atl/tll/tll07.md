### The Human Kingdom.

Before making any reference to what must, even at this early date, be
called the human kingdom, it must be stated that none of those who, at
the present day, can lay claim to even a moderate amount of mental or
spiritual culture *can* have lived in these ages. It was only with the
advent of the last three sub-races of this Third Root Race that the
least progressed of the first group of the Lunar Pitris began to return
to incarnation, while the most advanced among them did not take birth
till the early sub-races of the Atlantean period.

Indeed, Lemurian man, during at least the first half of the race, must
be regarded rather as an animal destined to reach

humanity than as human according to our understanding of the term; for
though the second and third groups of Pitris, who constituted the
inhabitants of Lemuria during its first four sub-races, had achieved
sufficient self-consciousness in the Lunar Manvantara to differentiate
them from the animal kingdom, they had not yet received the Divine Spark
which should endow them with mind and individuality--in other words,
make them truly human.
