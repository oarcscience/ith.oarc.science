<p><a name="page_404"><font size="1" color="green">p. 404</font></A></p> <h2 align="CENTER">CHAPTER VI.</h2> <h3 align="CENTER" align="center">THE AFRICAN COLONIES.</h3> 
<p>AFRICA, like Europe and America, evidences a commingling of different stocks: the blacks are not all black, nor all woolly-haired; the Africans pass through all shades, from that of a light Berber, no darker than the Spaniard, to the deep black of the Iolofs, between Senegal and Gambia.</p> 
<p>The traces of red men or copper-colored races are found in many parts of the continent. Prichard divides the true negroes into four classes; his second class is thus described:</p> 
<p>"2. Other tribes have forms and features like the European; their complexion is black, or a <i>deep olive</i>, or a <i>copper color</i> approaching to black, while their hair, though often crisp and frizzled, is not in the least woolly. Such are the Bishari and Danekil and Hazorta, and the darkest of the Abyssinians.</p> 
<p>"The complexion and hair of the Abyssinians vary very much, their complexion ranging from almost white to dark brown or black, and their hair from straight to crisp, frizzled, and almost woolly." (Nott and Gliddon, "Types of Mankind," p. 194.)</p> 
<p>"Some of the Nubians are copper-colored or black, with a tinge of red." (<i>Ibid</i>., p. 198.)</p> 
<p>Speaking of the Barbary States, these authors further say (<i>Ibid</i>., p. 204):</p> 
<p>"On the northern coast of Africa, between the Mediterranean and the Great Desert, including Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli, and Benzazi, there is a continuous system of highlands, which have been included under the general term Atlas--anciently Atlantis, now the Barbary States. . . . Throughout</p> 
<p><a name="page_405"><font size="1" color="green">p. 405</font></A></p> 
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Barbary we encounter a peculiar group of races, subdivided into many tribes of various shades, now spread over a vast area, but which formerly had its principal and perhaps <i>aboriginal abode along the mountain slopes of Atlas</i>. . . . The real name of the Berbers is <i>Mazirgh</i>, with the article prefixed or suffixed--T-amazirgh or Amazirgh-T--meaning <i>free</i>, <i>dominant</i>, or '<i>noble race</i>.' . . . We have every reason to believe the Berbers existed in the remotest times, with all their essential moral and physical peculiarities. . . . They existed in the time of Menes in the same condition in which they were discovered by Ph&#156;nician navigators previously to the foundation of Carthage. They are an indomitable, nomadic people, who, since the introduction of camels, have penetrated in considerable numbers into the Desert, and even as far as Nigritia. . . . <i>Some of these clans are white</i>, others black, with woolly hair."</p> 
<p>Speaking of the Barbary Moors, Prichard says:</p> 
<p>"Their figure and stature are nearly the same as those of the southern Europeans, and their complexion, if darker, is only so in proportion to the higher temperature of the country. It displays great varieties."</p> 
<p>Jackson says:</p> 
<p>"The men of Temsena and Showiah are of a strong, robust make, and of a copper color; the women are beautiful. The women of Fez are fair as the Europeans, but hair and eyes always dark. The women of Mequinas are very beautiful, and <i>have the red-and-white complexion of English women</i>."</p> 
<p>Spix and Martins, the German travellers, depict the Moors as follows:</p> 
<p>A high forehead, an oval countenance, large, speaking, black eyes, shaded by arched and strong eyebrows, a thin, rather long, but not too pointed nose, rather broad lips, meeting in an acute angle, <i>brownish-yellow complexion</i>, thick, smooth, and black hair, and a stature greater than the middle height."</p> 
<p>Hodgson states:</p> 
<p>"The Tuarycks are a white people, of the Berber race; the Mozabiaks are a <i>remarkably white</i> people, and mixed with the Bedouin Arabs. The Wadreagans and Wurgelans are of a <i>dark bronze</i>, with woolly hair."</p> 
<p><a name="page_406"><font size="1" color="green">p. 406</font></A></p> 
<p>The Foolahs, Fulbe (sing. <i>Pullo</i>), Fellani, or Fellatah, are a people of West and Central Africa. It is the opinion of modern travellers that the Foolahs are destined to become the dominant people of Negro-land. In language, appearance, and history they present striking differences from the neighboring tribes, to whom they are superior in intelligence, but inferior, according to Garth, in physical development. Golbery describes them as "robust and courageous, of a <i>reddish</i>-black color, with regular features, hair longer and less woolly than that of the common negroes, and high mental capacity." Dr. Barth found great local differences in their physical characteristics, as Bowen describes the Foolahs of Bomba as being some black, some almost white, and many of a mulatto color, varying from dark to very bright. Their features and skulls were cast in the European mould. They have a tradition that their ancestors were whites, and certain tribes call themselves white men. They came from Timbuctoo, which lies to the north of their present location.</p> 
<p>The Nubians and Foolahs are classed as Mediterraneans. They are not black, but yellowish-brown, or red-brown. The hair is not woolly but curly, and sometimes quite straight; it is either dark-brown or black, with a fuller growth of beard than the negroes. The oval face gives them a Mediterranean type. Their noses are prominent, their lips not puffy, and their languages have no connection with the tongues of the negroes proper. ("American Cyclop&aelig;dia," art. <i>Ethnology</i>, p. 759.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>"The Cromlechs (<i>dolmens</i>) of Algeria" was the subject of an address made by General Faidherbe at the Brussels International Congress. He considers these structures to be simply sepulchral monuments, and, after examining five or six thousand of them, maintains that the dolmens of Africa and of Europe were all constructed by the same race, during their emigration from the shores of the Baltic to the southern coast of the Mediterranean. The author does not, however, attempt to explain the existence of these monuments in other countries--</p> 
<p><a name="page_407"><font size="1" color="green">p. 407</font></A></p> 
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Hindostan, for instance, and America. "In Africa," he says, "cromlechs are called tombs of the idolaters"--the <i>idolaters</i> being neither Romans, nor Christians, nor Ph&#156;nicians, but some antique race. He regards the Berbers as the descendants of the primitive dolmen-builders. Certain Egyptian monuments tell of invasions of Lower Egypt one thousand five hundred years before our era by blond tribes from the West. The bones found in the cromlechs are those of a large and dolichocephalous race. General Faidherbe gives the average stature (including the women) at 1.65 or 1.74 metre, while the average stature of French carabineers is only 1.65 metre. He did not find a single brachycephalous skull. <A NAME="img_40700"></A>
<TABLE ALIGN="RIGHT"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="img/40700.jpg" ALT="TAMAHU, FROM THE EGYPTIAN MONUMENTS, 1500 B.C."><BR><FONT SIZE="-3">TAMAHU, FROM THE EGYPTIAN MONUMENTS, 1500 B.C.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE> The profiles indicated great intelligence. The Egyptian documents already referred to call the invaders Tamahu, which must have come from the invaders' own language, as it is not Egyptian. The Tuaregs of the present day may be regarded as the best representatives of the Tamahus. They are of lofty stature, have blue eyes, and cling to the custom of bearing long swords, to be wielded by both hands. In Soudan, on the banks of the Niger, dwells a negro tribe ruled by a royal family (Masas), who are of rather fair complexion, and claim descent from white men. <i>Masas</i> is perhaps the same as <i>Mashash</i>, which occurs in the Egyptian documents applied to the Tamahus. The Masas wear the hair in the same fashion as the Tamahus, and General Faidherbe is inclined to think that they too are the descendants of the dolmen-builders.</p> 
<p>These people, according to my theory, were colonists from Atlantis--colonists of three different races--white, yellow, and sunburnt or red.</p>
