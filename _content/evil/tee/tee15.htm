<p>FROM the protective amulets, specially intended to attract and baffle the evil eye by being worn on the person, or otherwise conspicuously displayed, we pass to another class of protectives, depending for their potency not upon symbolism so much as upon direct invocation of those powers or deities, typified by the various symbols, we have been considering. Of this class there are two distinct kinds: first, the written formul&aelig; of many sorts; and next, the spoken words or actions, all tending to the same end. Both kinds, moreover, may be either concealed from view and hearing, or openly displayed.</p> 
<p>Of the former, of course, the well-known Jewish phylacteries are the most obvious examples. Their virtue was supposed to rest in the written words shut up in the little leather case; their Hebrew name was <i>tephillim</i>, but the name, by which we know them in the New Testament sufficiently proves that they were amulets.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_640"></A><A HREF="#fn_640"><FONT SIZE="1">609</FONT></A></p>

<p>hands, horns, and wolf skin, is very frequently a little canvas bag, containing a prayer to the Madonna, or a verse of Scripture, but always with the same end in view--the <i>jettatore</i> must be countercharmed, in case the ostensible amulets should fail.</p> 
<p>Through the kindness of Mrs. Charles Elton we are able to present a facsimile of a true phylactery from Abyssinia, where such things are common at the present day. The language of this charm, though Amharic, "is not the vernacular, but wholly that of the sacred books, called by the people Geez." At the present time no Ethiopic scholar in Europe reads it, and I am fortunate in having at last found a translator. The full transcription and glossed translation here given are the work of the Rev. R. Weakley of Alexandria, in whose service is a native Ethiopic "debterah" or scribe. This man read it easily, and dictated to Mr. Weakley, who has thus rendered it into English. It appears that these charms are quite common, and there is a class of disreputable men in Abyssinia who get their living by concocting and writing them for their ignorant countrymen.</p> 
<p>Mr. Weakley has added some very valuable notes, which reader the whole much more intelligible, and the present writer desires fully to admit the obligation, and to express his thanks for this unique rendering into English of a most curious document--a document proving up to the hilt all the statements put forward as to the world-wide prevalence, even in these latter days, of the firm belief in the power of the evil eye.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_641"></A><A HREF="#fn_641"><FONT SIZE="1">610</FONT></A> The eyes themselves</p>

<p>The Ethiopic and the Somerset charms are exactly contemporary. The man who used the latter was well known to the writer.</p> 
<p>The manufacture of mystical writings is a very ancient art; so also is the teaching how to ascertain propitious days. <i>Dies fasti</i> and <i>ne fasti</i> were household words in ancient Rome. Much light is thrown on this art by a very remarkable papyrus in the British Museum (No. XLVI. Greek) of about the second century A.D. It came from Egypt, and was discovered in one of the later tombs. The magic arts practised in the early years of the Christian era, which Iren&aelig;us, Origen, Epiphanius, and other Fathers lay to the charge of the heretics of their day, are he-rein laid bare.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_654"></A><A HREF="#fn_654"><FONT SIZE="1">622</FONT></A></p> 
<p>Several spells are given in this document for various purposes, amongst which is one for producing an immediate vision of the god evoked by the operator. Besides the words of incantation, we are told (p. 5) "in a brazen cup with oil, anoint your right eye with water taken from a boat that has been wrecked, and the left [mixing some] Coptic <i>stibium</i> with the water. And if you cannot find water from a boat that has been wrecked, take some from a wicker wherry that has been submerged."</p>

<p>to confess; but the chief interest of the papyrus lies in the following translation:--</p> 
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">Take a sheet of hieratic paper, or a leaden plate, and an iron ring, and place the ring upon the paper, and mark both inside and out with a pen the form of a ring. Then having described the circular outline of the ring, write upon the said outline, inscribing upon the paper the name, and the characters on the outside, and inside the thing which you wish not to happen, or that such a man's mind may be bound so as not to do such and such a thing. Then placing the ring upon its outline which you have made, and taking up the parts outside the outline, sew up the ring with thread, so as to completely conceal it, piercing through the characters with the pen, and when you wish to bind, say: "I bind such an one not to speak to such an one; let him not resist, let him not contradict, let him not be able to look me in the face, or to answer me, but let him be subject to me as long as this ring is buried. And again I bind his mind, and his senses, his desires, his actions, that he may be sluggish towards all men . . . and let not such a woman marry such a man. Common words."</p> 
<p>Then taking it to the grave of one untimely dead, dig four fingers deep and put it in and say "O! departed spirit whosoever thou art . . . I deliver to thee such an one, that he may not do such a thing." Then having covered it up depart.--And you will do it best in the waning of the moon.--The words written within the circle are these (several lines of Greek): let such a thing not be done, as long as this ring is buried. Bind it with knots, making strings for that purpose, and thus deposit it. The ring may also be cast into a disused well, or into the grave of one untimely dead. And after the characters write also these words below the ring as a base (five lines of Greek) and the . . . spell which you also place within.</FONT></p>

<p>There does not appear to be anything which may be termed Magical in the words, but neither is there in passages from Scripture or the Koran worn at the present day. It is very difficult in most cases to perceive any connection between the actual words or figures used, and the purpose for which they are inscribed. This one is based on the ancient Orphic mysticism.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_658"></A><A HREF="#fn_658"><FONT SIZE="1">626</FONT></A> The shape of the case and general conditions, however, prove it incontestably to have been a charm for the protection of the wearer.</p>

<p>versions of the well-known <i>Abracadabra</i>, which was <i>amuletum insigne</i> not only against hemitrit&aelig;um, but also against fevers and other maladies. This famous cabalistic form is of very ancient date, for even in the third century it was a traditional prescription, set out at length by Qu. Serenus Ammoniacus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_660"></A><A HREF="#fn_660"><FONT SIZE="1">628</FONT></A> physician to Gordian Junior.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_661"></A><A HREF="#fn_661"><FONT SIZE="1">629</FONT></A> He directs it to be written in the form of an inverted cone, <i>i.e.</i> each line of repetition drops the final letter until A alone remains as the apex. Frommannd (p. 309) says that this is like the amulet of the Talmudists, worn on their necks against blindness.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_662"></A><A HREF="#fn_662"><FONT SIZE="1">630</FONT></A></p> 
<p>Very closely allied to these writings for the protection of the living, is the remarkable custom still surviving in Russia, of placing in the hands of the dead a sort of passport to the nether-world almost precisely analogous to the "Book of the Dead" of ancient Egypt, see <i>ante</i>, pp. <A HREF="tee04.htm#page_50">50</A>, <A HREF="tee04.htm#page_51">51</A>.</p>

<p>There is abundant evidence in all lands of the value attached to certain words, usually written, though they may be merely uttered, to keep off evil from, or to bring good to, the user. The well-worn "blessed word Mesopotamia" proves that the idea survives, though allied to crass ignorance. The many Scriptural or other inscriptions upon old houses here in England, and perhaps more commonly upon the Continent, or the passages from the Koran upon the houses of Mahomedans, are much less in reality the expressions of piety than protective charms against the origin of every misfortune--the evil eye.</p> 
<p>The first words of the Gospel of St. John in any of the Aryan languages have always been held of great virtue when carried on the person. These should be written upon virgin parchment, enclosed in a goose quill, an hour before sunrise on the first Sunday in the year.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_664"></A><A HREF="#fn_664"><FONT SIZE="1">631</FONT></A></p> 
<p>Brand (iii. 319) gives a number of similar inscriptions, which were called <i>Characts</i>, but the real collector of them must go to Frommannd or Delrio. The former quotes Voetius, who says that the beginning of the fourth Gospel was worn as an amulet from the times of the Apostles themselves.</p>

<p>Combinations of figures, too, have long had high reputation as efficient protectors, particularly those called magic squares-in which certain numbers are arranged in rows, so that their sum, in whatsoever direction it may be taken, always produces the same result.</p>

<p>Not only do we find great store set upon the many combinations such as these, but very wonderful things are done with figures outside the sphere of magic, so that the ignorant may well have become impressed by the power of numbers whether expressed in writing or not. The curious results certain people delight in producing from numbers found in the Revelation and other sacred books are but proofs of the still surviving idea that mystery lies in the very numbers themselves. What wonderful prophecies have been obtained by manipulation of the figures recited in the Book of Daniel, whereby the end of the world has been so often foretold, and the "number of the beast" deciphered!</p> 
<p>In an article called "In Calabria-Passeggiate," by Caterina Pignorini-Beri,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_668"></A><A HREF="#fn_668"><FONT SIZE="1">635</FONT></A> is a description of what was seen in a peasant's house:--</p> 
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">In an angle just over the doorway was affixed a horseshoe; above this were two horns painted, and beneath were placed the two magic numbers (<i>numeri fatali</i>) 8 and 9 to avert the <i>jettatura</i>. "Why is this?" I asked. The old woman replied: "Against</FONT></p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p><a name="page_404"><font size="1" color="green">p. 404</font></A></p> 
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">the evil eye, Miss" ("<i>Pel fora fascino, signorina</i>"). "And what is the evil eye?" "Ah!" said the old woman, pointing the fore and little fingers towards the ground:--</p> 
<p>"Ah! eight nine, eight nine!"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_669"></A><A HREF="#fn_669"><FONT SIZE="1">636</FONT></A></p> 
<p>But why eight nine?"</p> 
<p>"Eccellenza, the witches (<i>streghe</i>) say <i>six</i> and <i>seven</i>."</p> 
<p>No other explanation was obtainable--perhaps it is the only one that can be given, owing to the terror of witchcraft which inspires all southerners, gentle and simple alike. It was indeed a new thing to break the seven, the famous cabalistic seven, which has pursued humanity for six thousand years, by (the use of) the next number. In fact the poor woman had given me something more than others--she had given me a valid reason for the <i>fora fascino</i>, and I could not grumble.</FONT></p> 
<p>The authoress does not further explain the numbers, but she calls at another ground-floor tenement (botteguccia), and remarks that the usual bed was not in the room, nor were the numbers 8 and 9, nor the horseshoe, nor the painted horns to be seen. The owner was a corporal of <i>bersaglieri</i>, and therefore arrived at a state of new civilisation which took no note of such things. She concludes her remarks with the regretful "Ahime! Non tutti sono pi&ugrave; calabresi in Calabria!"</p> 
<p>In Calabria the words which we should translate by "amulet against the evil eye" are <i>fora fascino</i>. The authoress in another place (p. 66) speaks of the utterance of the numbers 8 and 9 as a charm <i>per allontanare la malia</i>. So far as the present writer knows, of all Italians the lottery-loving Calabresi alone furnish an example of the belief that the mere utterance of particular numbers is a protective charm.</p> 
<p>We all know of the common belief in "the luck in odd numbers." We shall see it later in the many</p>

<p><a name="page_405"><font size="1" color="green">p. 405</font></A></p> 
<p>repetitions of "three times" as to spitting. The old saying "Third time lucky" is familiar to everybody.</p> 
<p>Three has always been looked upon by both Jews and Gentiles as a specially complete and mystic number. In Scripture, three is given as an exact measure, while other numbers were used indefinitely, merely to convey the notion of several, or of a great many, precisely as we now speak of dozens, scores, or thousands, when we do not even imply any definite number. There were three great feasts; there were three cities of refuge, and the number three is several times repeated in connection with them; three alternatives were offered to David, and two of these had each the special element of three in it. So we have the three Christian virtues; three great witnesses; and endless other examples of the use of three as something more than a mere numeral. The three-sided triangle is said to be symbolic of deity, pagan as much as Christian. The Egyptians had triads of divinities, specially worshipped in particular cities, while the Romans had their Diana Triformis. In the Hebrides the accounts given in Chap. II. on sun-worship show that each act was performed three times. We are told&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_670"></A><A HREF="#fn_670"><FONT SIZE="1">637</FONT></A> that in Ireland a cure for whooping-cough, called there <i>chin-cough</i>, is to pass the child three times over and under a donkey, certain prayers being said during the operation. So spitting as a preventive act had to be done three times, and in the many recited acts to be performed it will be noted how often "three times" occurs.</p> 
<p>It is not merely as an odd number that three</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p><a name="page_406"><font size="1" color="green">p. 406</font></A></p> 
<p>of all others was held so specially sacred; yet the preference generally for odd numbers is not only old but still abiding. As a matter of course an odd number of eggs are put under a hen. Indeed this is so thoroughly recognised, that one sees constant advertisements of choice eggs for sale at so much "per sitting." A sitting of eggs is a number just as well known as a baker's dozen--thirteen. The notion is that a brood is certain to be odd in number, and that therefore to set an even number of eggs is certain waste. The fact, however, remains that as often as not an even number of chicks are hatched; still the custom is to set thirteen, and no luck is expected from an even number. Again, military salutes are always odd in number. A Royal salute is twenty-one guns. The valiant "Thirteen Club" is in itself an evidence of the belief that if odd numbers generally are lucky, thirteen sitting down together at a meal is held to be unlucky--indeed fatal to one of the party. This notion is said by some to be based upon the experience of past mortality: that out of thirteen adults, the chances are strong that one will die during the next year. Moreover, under the well-worn paradox that exceptions prove the rule, thirteen is a specially unlucky number, except for the setting of eggs.</p> 
<p>Perhaps in these latter days, however, the magic number seven is the one most used. It is that of the strega in Calabria, and of the white-witch in England. A seventh son of a seventh son is a born doctor--he has miraculous powers of healing by touch.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_671"></A><A HREF="#fn_671"><FONT SIZE="1">638</FONT></A> "The doctor" is the recognised name here in</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Somerset of a seventh son; and it is very Commonly held that he should be trained for one, as a matter of course. Seven has always been a mystical number. Balaam had seven altars built by the sun-worshipper Balak, three distinct times. Elisha ordered Naaman to wash in Jordan seven times. Elijah sent seven times to the top of Carmel. The days of Creation were seven; seven weeks divided the great feasts. There were seven Churches in Asia; the great dragon of the Revelation had seven heads; there were seven angels with seven vials; besides a host of sevens, where perhaps only an indefinite number was implied.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_672"></A><A HREF="#fn_672"><FONT SIZE="1">639</FONT></A> Curiously, too, the common name for the dormouse is the "seven-sleeper," no doubt from the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_673"></A><A HREF="#fn_673"><FONT SIZE="1">640</FONT></A> We west-country folks talk of a person who sleeps soundly as a "proper zeb'm-slaiper."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_674"></A><A HREF="#fn_674"><FONT SIZE="1">640a</FONT></A> Again, there is a very common belief that in seven years a man changes every atom in his body, and that each seventh year of his life is a climacteric in which he has to pass through dangers physical and moral. The sixty-third year, that is the ninth septennial period, is the "grand climacteric"--the year specially perilous to old men. The very common term of leases for seven, fourteen, or twenty-one years, is believed to originate in the idea that it is desirable to reconsider conditions and to renew agreements</p>

<p>in accordance with the recognised stages of human life.</p> 
<p>The numbers of certain days and months are considered fortunate or otherwise according to certain modes of reckoning, wherein the rationale or the logic is by no means obvious.</p> 
<p>A curious little black-letter book called <i>A Concordancie of Yeares</i>, by Arthur Hopton, 1612, gives a chapter headed "Of the infortunate and fatall dayes of the yeare," etc., which throws some light upon the methods of "wise men." It sets out the infortunate days, beginning--</p><dir> <dir>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">January the 1, 2, 4, 5, 10,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_675"></A><A HREF="#fn_675"><FONT SIZE="1">641</FONT></A> 15, 17, 19.</p> 
<p>February the 8, 10, and the 17.</p> 
<p>March the 15, 16, and the 19.</p> 
<p>Aprill the 16 and 21. Not so euill the 7, 8, 10, 20;</FONT></p></dir> </dir>  
<p>and so on through the year. He says that "astrologers will have in every moone 2 infortunate daies, wherein they recount it most unhappy to begin or undertake any kind of worldly affaires." These he specifies, and says "it is therefore very ill to have a child borne in them, for feare of an euill death." The most unfortunate days of all the year are "January the 3 day, July the 1, October the 7, Aprill the 30, August the 1 and the 3l."</p> 
<p>Those in the former table were only "infortunate," while these latter appear to be fatal.</p> 
<p>There were also two days in every month called <i>&AElig;gri</i>, <i>mali</i> and <i>&AElig;gyptiaci</i>. On <i>&AElig;gri</i> "if any fell sick they should hardly or never escape." On <i>mali</i> "evill affections of the Constellations" would frustrate any kind of work, and <i>&AElig;gyptiaci</i> were unlucky</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p><a name="page_409"><font size="1" color="green">p. 409</font></A></p> 
<p>because they were so thought by the Egyptians, and because "they do also note unto us the 10 plagues of Egypt in these verses":--</p><dir> <dir>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">Sanguis, rana, culex, musc&aelig; parv&aelig;, pecus, ulcus,<br> Grando, locust&aelig;, nox, mors, prius orta necant.</FONT></p></dir> </dir>  
<p>We are told how to discover lucky or unlucky days, and that "these infortunate days were noted alwaies in the Romane Kalender, notwithstanding y<sup>e</sup> inhibition of Augustine, saying: 'Calendas mensium, et dies &AElig;gyptiacos, non observetis.' But yet to satisfie all, take them in the ensuing verses":--</p><dir> <dir>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">Armis Gunfe, Dei Kalatos, Adamare dabatur.<br> Lixa memor, Constans gelidos, Infancia quosdam.<br> Omne limen, Aaron bagis, Concordia laudat.<br> Chije linkat, Ei Coequata, Gearcha Lisardus.</FONT></p></dir> </dir>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Of the words in these four lines of gibberish he says that</p> 
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">every two serve for one moneth, the first standing for January. If therefore you desire to know the first of the two former fatall daies in any moneth, count so many daies from the beginning of the moneth, descending, as the: first letter in the first word is distant from A inclusively, according to the Alphabet, and where that number ends, there is a fatall day: as in Aprill, L (beginning Lixa) is the 10 letter in the Alphabet, therefore the 10 day is fatall, and according to the number of the first letter (in order of y<sup>e</sup> Alphabet) of the seco_d sillable, y<sup>e</sup> said houre of y<sup>e</sup> said day is vehemently to be suspected.</FONT></p> 
<p>In similar fashion, but "ascending," he shows how to reckon the second fatal day; but we are not told how or by whom the magic verses were composed, whereby such discoveries can be made.</p>

In Shoa these Za_rs are worshipped, we were told, by those who are in the habit of smoking tobacco, except foreigners; and we persuaded ourselves that that very custom is, by those Shoa people who followed it, observed in honour of those imaginary beings. After having witnessed an extraordinary instance of Za_rolatry in our own house, where we saw an otherwise intelligent and respectable woman alternately smoking and praying to the Za_rs with great vehemence until she was mad, and then killing a hen whose brain she ate and became quiet again; after this, I say, we inquired into several instances where we met with smokers, and found that they all were worshippers of the Za_rs.
