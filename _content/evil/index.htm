Evil is, on one level, a cultural construct.  The Easter Islanders
believed that stealing, if successful, was virtuous.
This was probably a social mechanism for redistributing scarce
items on a small island.
However some evils--war, genocide, and terrorism to name a few--are
instantly recognizable as such.
The issue of why an omniscient, all-powerful God would
permit such horrors is one of the most difficult (and obvious)
religious questions.
This section of sacred-texts deals with this thorny issue.

<P>
Note that there aren't any sacred texts of Satanism <I>per se</I> at this site.
Satanism as an organized religion is a very recent phenomena,
and books about it are a long way from entering the public domain.
Besides, to put a fine point on it,
actual Satanists insist that they aren't evil.
