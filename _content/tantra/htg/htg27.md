### (TRIPURASUNDARĪSTOTRA)

1

I SEEK refuge with Tripurasundarī, <span
id="fr_1063"></span>[1](#fn_1057)  
Who wanders in the Kadamba forest; <span
id="fr_1064"></span>[2](#fn_1058)  
The spouse of the Three-eyed One, <span
id="fr_1065"></span>[3](#fn_1059)  
Bank of cloud (in the sky of the heart) of numbers of sages, <span
id="fr_1066"></span>[4](#fn_1060)

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

Whose hips defeat the mountain by their greatness. <span
id="fr_1067"></span>[1](#fn_1061)  
Who is served by celestial women,  
Whose eyes are like the newly blown lotus,  
And who is dark as the colour of a freshly formed rain-cloud. <span
id="fr_1068"></span>[2](#fn_1062)

2

I seek refuge with Tripurasundarī,  
The Spouse of the Three-eyed One,  
Who dwells in the Kadamba forest,  
And who is ever wandering;  
The Large-eyed One who holds a golden *vīnā*, <span
id="fr_1069"></span>[3](#fn_1063)  
Wearing a necklace of priceless gems,  
Whose face is glowing with wine, <span
id="fr_1070"></span>[4](#fn_1064)  
And who of Her mercy grants prosperity to Her devotees.

3

Ever are we protected by Her whose abode is the Kadamba forest,  
The weight of whose breasts are garlanded with glittering gems,  
Whose breasts are rising, <span id="fr_1071"></span>[5](#fn_1065)

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

And excel the mountain in greatness;  
Whose cheeks are flushed with wine, <span
id="fr_1072"></span>[1](#fn_1066)  
Ever singing sweet songs; the playful one, <span
id="fr_1073"></span>[2](#fn_1067) dark as a cloud,  
Ever compassionate to all.

4

I seek refuge with Tripurasundarī,  
The Spouse of the Three-eyed One,  
Who stays in the Kadamba forest,  
Who is seated in the golden circle and dwells in the six lotuses, <span
id="fr_1074"></span>[3](#fn_1068)  
Ever revealing like lightning the great power (of devotees), <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[4](#fn_1069)  
Whose beauty is like that of the *Jaba* flower, <span
id="fr_1076"></span>[5](#fn_1070)  
And whose brow is adorned with the full moon.

5

I take refuge with Her, the sweet speaker,  
Daughter of the sage Matanga, <span id="fr_1077"></span>[6](#fn_1071)

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

Whose breast is adorned with the *vinā*. <span
id="fr_1078"></span>[1](#fn_1072)  
And whose head is beauteous with locks of curling hair;  
Who dwells in the lotus; <span id="fr_1079"></span>[2](#fn_1073)  
The destroyer of the wicked,  
Whose eyes are reddened with wine; <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[3](#fn_1074)  
The charmer of the enemy of the God of Love. <span
id="fr_1081"></span>[4](#fn_1075)

6

I take refuge with Tripurasundarī,  
The Spouse of the Three-eyed One,  
Who should be meditated upon as in the first flush of Her nubile
youth, <span id="fr_1082"></span>[5](#fn_1076)  
Her blue garment stained with drops of blood. <span
id="fr_1083"></span>[6](#fn_1077)  
Holding the wine-cup, <span id="fr_1084"></span>[7](#fn_1078)  
Her eyes rolling with wine; <span id="fr_1085"></span>[8](#fn_1079)

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

With heavy, high, and close-set breasts, <span
id="fr_1086"></span>[1](#fn_1080)  
Dark of colour, and with dishevelled hair. <span
id="fr_1087"></span>[2](#fn_1081)

9

At time of recitation I remember the Mother,  
Lustrous as the scarlet hibiscus, <span
id="fr_1088"></span>[3](#fn_1082)  
Her body pasted with saffron and sandal,  
Her hair kissed by musk; <span id="fr_1089"></span>[4](#fn_1083)  
The Mother with smiling eyes, <span id="fr_1090"></span>[5](#fn_1084)  
With red garland, ornaments, and raiment,  
Who holds the arrow, bow, noose, and goad; <span
id="fr_1091"></span>[6](#fn_1085)  
The charmer <span id="fr_1092"></span>[7](#fn_1086) of countless men.

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

8

I worship the World-Mother  
Who is served by celestial women,  
The Spouse of Indra,  
     Skilful in plaiting hair; <span id="fr_1093"></span>[1](#fn_1087)  
     The devoted Spouse of Brahmā,  
     Anointed with sandal paste;  
     The Spouse of Viṣṇu,  
     Adorned with pleasing ornaments.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1057"></span>[169:1](htg27.htm#fr_1063) The Devī is so
called as the Spouse of Śiva, destroyer of the *tripura*, or cities of
the three Asuras--Kamalākṣa, Tarakākṣa, and Vidyun-māli. According to
the Kālikā Purāṇa, Paraśiva is Tripurā, because he has three *pura* in
Him, His body becoming triple upon the manifestation therein of Brahmā,
Viṣṇu, and Śiva. The Devī is then the Śakti of Paramaśiva.

<span id="fn_1058"></span>[169:2](htg27.htm#fr_1064) The Kadamba
(*Nauclea cadamba*) is a tree with orange fragrant blossom whereunder
Kṛṣṇa played (see *Ādyākālisvarūpaśtotra* in Mahānirvāṇa Tantra).
*Kadamba* also denotes number (multitude), and in this sense the
*Kadamba* forest is the universe which the Devī permeates.

<span id="fn_1059"></span>[169:3](htg27.htm#fr_1065) Śiva with the
central eye of wisdom. Śiva is also *Tryambaka*, because He is the
father of the three Devas, Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Rudra (Tarkālangkāra
Commentary, Mahānirvāṇa Tantra). The Ṛgvidhāna uses it as equivalent of
Mahādeva.

<span id="fn_1060"></span>[169:4](htg27.htm#fr_1066) *Muni*. As the bank
of cloud gives water, so She quenches the spiritual thirst of *munis*.

<span id="fn_1061"></span>[170:1](htg27.htm#fr_1067)
*Nitambajitabhudaram*. *Nitamba* literally means buttocks, which,
however, here reads rather absurdly in English, the side or hips being
*pārśa*, *kakṣa*, or *shroni* (*cf*. tenth śloka of the
*Karpurākhyastava* "*Samantādāpinastana-jaghanadhrikyauvanavatī*")

<span id="fn_1062"></span>[170:2](htg27.htm#fr_1068) That is, of the
dark blue colour seen when the blue of the sky appears through a
freshly-formed black rain-cloud.

<span id="fn_1063"></span>[170:3](htg27.htm#fr_1069) A stringed musical
instrument of that name.

<span id="fn_1064"></span>[170:4](htg27.htm#fr_1070)
*Mukhasamullasattvārunim*. *Vāruni* is wine made from rice. Here and in
following verses the divine ambrosia (*amṛta*) is referred to.

<span id="fn_1065"></span>[170:5](htg27.htm#fr_1071) "Rising" (*cf*.
*Durgādhyāna* in "Devī Purāṇa") *pīnonnata payodharām*. As to weight and
greatness, see *Annapūrṇādhyāna*, *Bhuvaneśvaristotra*,
"*āpīvarastanatating tanuvrittamadhyām*," and Introduction.

<span id="fn_1066"></span>[171:1](htg27.htm#fr_1072) *Madārunakapolaya*
(see n. 4, [p. 170](#page_170)).

<span id="fn_1067"></span>[171:2](htg27.htm#fr_1073) *Lilayā*. Play
(*līlā*) is the mark of a Deva, and the Devī's substance is play
(*lilāmayī*). The Devī is Lalitā ("She who plays"): Padma Purāṇa says:
"Having passed beyond the world She plays, hence She is called Lalitā."
But the Creation is also Her play.

<span id="fn_1068"></span>[171:3](htg27.htm#fr_1074) *Ṣaḍāmbhu*--that
is, the six cakra or centres in the human body: the *mulādhāra*,
*svādihṣṭhāna*, *manipūra*, *anāhata*, *viśuddha*, and *ājnāpadmas* (see
the translation of the Satcakra Nirūpaṇa from the Sanskrit, *The Serpent
Power*). The Devī exists as Kuṇḍalinī in these *cakra*.

<span id="fn_1069"></span>[171:4](htg27.htm#fr_1075)
*Satatasiddhisaudaminim*. *Siddhi* (power so called), which lies latent,
is instantly brought to light by Her.

<span id="fn_1070"></span>[171:5](htg27.htm#fr_1076) Scarlet hibiscus,
the Tāntrik flower sacred to the Devī.

<span id="fn_1071"></span>[171:6](htg27.htm#fr_1077) *Ṛṣi*.

<span id="fn_1072"></span>[172:1](htg27.htm#fr_1078) The musical
instrument which She holds and which rests on Her breast.

<span id="fn_1073"></span>[172:2](htg27.htm#fr_1079) For she is also
Kamalā or Lakṣmī.

<span id="fn_1074"></span>[172:3](htg27.htm#fr_1080)
*Madārunāvilochanam* (see [p. 170](#page_170). note 4).

<span id="fn_1075"></span>[172:4](htg27.htm#fr_1081) That is, charmer of
Śiva who destroyed Kāmadeva with the fire from His eyes when the latter
sought to distract him by thought of passion from the *yoga* in which he
was engaged.

<span id="fn_1076"></span>[172:5](htg27.htm#fr_1082) *Smaretprathama
puṣpinīm*, literally "as having the first 'flower'" which is used in the
same symbolical sense as in English. The *puṣpotsava* is the religious
festival held on its first appearance at puberty.

<span id="fn_1077"></span>[172:6](htg27.htm#fr_1083)
*Rudhiravīndunīlambaram*--that is, stained with the *puṣpa* ("flower").
As this first shows itself when woman is ready to bear, so in the blue
sky, which is the Devī's garment, signs are seen which herald Her
creation.

<span id="fn_1078"></span>[172:7](htg27.htm#fr_1084)
*Grihītamadhupānikām*.

<span id="fn_1079"></span>[172:8](htg27.htm#fr_1085)
*Madhuvighurnanetranchalam* (see [p. 170](#page_170), n. 4).

<span id="fn_1080"></span>[173:1](htg27.htm#fr_1086) *Ghanastana
bharonnatām*: "heavy" (*cf.* *Annapūrṇadhyāna Annapradāna-niratām
stanabhāranamrām*"); "high" (*cf*. *Durgādhyana*, *ante* Introduction);
"close," so that, as it is said in the Kumarāsambhavam (chap. i.) of
Kalidāsa: "Even the filament of a lotus could not be passed between
them" ("*mrinālasūtrāntaramapyalabhyam*").

<span id="fn_1081"></span>[173:2](htg27.htm#fr_1087) *Galitachikurām*.
The Devī in this and other forms, as Kālī, Tārā and Chinnamastā is so
represented. The epithet is a common one in Tantra (*cf*.
*Karpūrādistotra*, verse 3).

<span id="fn_1082"></span>[173:3](htg27.htm#fr_1088) *Jaba*, v. *ante*.
So also the Lalitā (verse 147), "whose body is like the China rose."

<span id="fn_1083"></span>[173:4](htg27.htm#fr_1089) See the
*Ādyākālisvarūpa Stotra* in the Mahānirvāṇa Tantra.

<span id="fn_1084"></span>[173:5](htg27.htm#fr_1090) The Devī is,
according to the Lalitā Sahasranāma (verse 59) *chāruhāsa* (with
beautiful smile), indicating a certain state of consciousness
(*prabodha*) of highest bliss.

<span id="fn_1085"></span>[173:6](htg27.htm#fr_1091) These are Her
weapons. The Tantrarāja (Vāsana chap.) says: "Mind is the bow of
sugar-cane, desire the noose, anger the goad, and the five subtle
sources of the elements (*tanmātra*) the five arrows of flowers." But
the Yoginīhridaya says: "The noose is *Iccāśakti*, and goad
*Jnānāśakti*, and the bow and arrows *Kriyāśakti*."

<span id="fn_1086"></span>[173:7](htg27.htm#fr_1092) She deludes men
with her *māyā*; hence the Lalitā (verse 137) calls Her
"all-bewildering" (*sarvamohinī*). The Kurma Purāṇā says: "This *māyā*
is dear to me by which the world is bewildered. I bewilder the whole
universe with the Devas, Daityas, and men."

<span id="fn_1087"></span>[174:1](htg27.htm#fr_1093)
*Cikurabandhasairiṇdhrikām*: for Her hair, which is in some of Her
aspects dishevelled, is in others beautifully arranged.
