I WORSHIP Kālabhairava, <span id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48) Lord of the

Our great Saviour in our voyage across the ocean of the world. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_48"></span>[15:1](htg05.htm#fr_48) Śiva as such.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[15:2](htg05.htm#fr_49) Benares. The
Kāśipanchakastotra of Śankara says that the pure Ganges is the flow of
knowledge and Kāśī is Śiva's mind (*Jnānapravāhāvimalādigangā
sakāśikāham nijabodharūpah*).

<span id="fn_50"></span>[15:3](htg05.htm#fr_50) Devarāja or Indra.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[15:4](htg05.htm#fr_51) Hence Śiva is called
Candraśekhara.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[15:5](htg05.htm#fr_52) *Digambaram*, as are the
*Yogis* of whom He is Master. For He is clothed with space itself.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[15:6](htg05.htm#fr_53) The Ṛṣi of that name.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[15:7](htg05.htm#fr_54) The refrain is: "I
worship Kālabhairava, Lord of the city of Kāśī."

<span id="fn_55"></span>[16:1](htg05.htm#fr_55) A constant simile. The
world is a storm-tossed ocean not free of danger, even in moments of
calm, for therein many dangers, perils, and terrors lie.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[16:2](htg05.htm#fr_56) For Śiva swallowed the
poison which issued at the churning of the ocean to save the earth from
its dangerous presence.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[16:3](htg05.htm#fr_57) For with the ordinary
eyes He bears in the forehead the eye of wisdom.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[16:4](htg05.htm#fr_58) Śiva is the conqueror of
death ("*mrityunjaya*"), for he gives that knowledge which frees man of
its terrors.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[16:5](htg05.htm#fr_59) Even often of the
low-caste Candālas and others, for Śiva is the adored and protector of
all.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[16:6](htg05.htm#fr_60) His peculiar weapon.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[16:7](htg05.htm#fr_61) For all causes
potentially lie in His destructive energies, the manifestation of which
is the prelude of re-creation.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[16:8](htg05.htm#fr_62) *Śūla*, *tangka*,
*pāśa*, *daṇḍa*, His implements.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[16:9](htg05.htm#fr_63) As Kālabhairava. Usually
he is white and smeared with ashes "shining like a mountain of silver."

<span id="fn_64"></span>[16:10](htg05.htm#fr_64) Hence He is called
Mahādeva.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[17:1](htg05.htm#fr_65) *Vichitratāṇḍavapriyam*.
Śiva is often pictured dancing as Natarāja. The place of the dance is
the body of the individual and the world spoken of as *vanam* (the
forest), on account of the multitude of its components. He as the inner
*ātman* causes all things to dance into and out of life, and again into
it. All life and activity comes through Him, "the unseen Lord of the
stage."

<span id="fn_66"></span>[17:2](htg05.htm#fr_66)
*Bhuktimuktidāyakam*--that is, He gives both worldly and heavenly
enjoyment, and that release from both which is the unending bliss of
liberation.

<span id="fn_67"></span>[17:3](htg05.htm#fr_67) Hung on a girdle.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[17:4](htg05.htm#fr_68) Righteousness. For
*dharma*, religion, law, and duty, are the bridge whereby the dangerous
waters of the world are passed.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[17:5](htg05.htm#fr_69) Unrighteousness.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[17:6](htg05.htm#fr_70) The cause and fruit of
action whereby man is bound to the phenomenal world until by knowledge,
*karma* is exhausted and destroyed, and liberation (through Śiva, with
whose essential being His worshipper becomes one) is attained.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[18:1](htg05.htm#fr_71) The desired (or patron)
Deity of the devotee.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[18:2](htg05.htm#fr_72) For He is the Supreme
Unity.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[18:3](htg05.htm#fr_73) See ante, [p.
16](#page_16), note 4.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[18:4](htg05.htm#fr_74) Each world (for there
are many) is called an egg of Brahmā the creator (*brahmāṇḍa*). Śiva the
great Destroyer by His loud laughter shatters them.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[18:5](htg05.htm#fr_75) Brahmā.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[18:6](htg05.htm#fr_76) *Siddhi*--namely,
*aṇimā*, *mahimā*, *garīmā*, *laghimā*, *prāpti*, *prākāmya*, *iṣitva*,
and *vaṣitva*. The power to become very small, vast, light, heavy, power
of vision and movement, the powers of creation and control over the
worlds and their Lords. These *siddhi* are powers of the all-pervading
*ātmā*, and to greater or less degree may be acquired by Śivayogins
according as they realize their unity therewith.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[19:1](htg05.htm#fr_77) *Kāśivāsiloka
punyapāpaśodhakām*: for to the liberated there is neither sin nor virtue
which are qualities of the phenomenal *jivātma* only. The liberated are
above both.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[19:2](htg05.htm#fr_78) *Nītimargakovidam*.
