### TĀRĀ <span id="fr_321"></span>[1](#fn_321)

### (TĀRĀSṬAKAM) <span id="fr_322"></span>[2](#fn_322)

### FROM THE NĪLA TANTRA

1

O MOTHER, Devī Nīlasarasvatī <span id="fr_323"></span>[3](#fn_323) Tārā,

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

Refuge with Thee I crave.  
Giver of prosperity and wealth art Thou  
To those who worship Thee. Standing on Śiva,  
Thy right foot upon His breast and left upon His thigh.  
Ever art Thou, with smiling lotus-like face.  
Thy three eyes are, as it were, full-blown lotuses.  
In Thy hands Thou holdest a knife, <span id="fr_324"></span>[1](#fn_324)
a skull, a lotus, and a sword.

2

Thou art the presiding Devī of speech.  
Thou art the creeper which grants all desires. <span
id="fr_325"></span>[2](#fn_325)  
Thou art the giver of all *siddhi*, <span
id="fr_326"></span>[3](#fn_326)  
And the power to write both verse and prose.  
Three are Thine eyes, as it were blue lotuses.  
Ocean of kindness and compassion art Thou.  
I pray Thee of Thy mercy shower upon me the nectar of prosperity.

3

O Sharbhā, <span id="fr_327"></span>[4](#fn_327) I pray Thee remove my
fears.  
Proud Lady, brilliant are Thy garments,  
Bright with coiling serpents.  
Thou art clad in tiger skin.  
Thy waist is adorned with tiny tinkling bells.  
Thou holdest the heads of two demons  
Dripping with blood, just severed by the sword.  
Thy waist is girdled with heads of demons,

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

As it were with a garland.  
Thus art Thou beautiful, O formidable One. <span
id="fr_328"></span>[1](#fn_328)

4

O Devī Tārā, attained with difficulty,  
I take refuge with Thee.  
Thou art beautiful with form both amorous and charmful. <span
id="fr_329"></span>[2](#fn_329)  
Thou art *Bindu* and the half-moon, <span
id="fr_330"></span>[3](#fn_330)  
Whose substance is *Hrīm* and *Phat*. <span
id="fr_331"></span>[4](#fn_331)  
Thou art *mantra* <span id="fr_332"></span>[5](#fn_332) and the shelter
of all.  
Thy forms are threefold  
Gross, Subtle, and Supreme.  
Thou art beyond the reach of Veda. <span id="fr_333"></span>[6](#fn_333)

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

5

By the service of Thy lotus feet,  
Men of good deed attain *sāyujya* <span id="fr_334"></span>[1](#fn_334)
liberation.  
O Parameśvarī, Thou art the Spouse of Him <span
id="fr_335"></span>[2](#fn_335)  
Who is Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and the three-eyed One.  
O Mother! he who neglects to serve Thy lotus feet,  
But serves instead the Devas, Indra, and others,  
Who are themselves plunged in the ocean of samsāra, <span
id="fr_336"></span>[3](#fn_336)  
Is indeed and most truly ignorant.

6

O Mother! those Devas who receive on their crowns  
The pollen which comes from Thy lotus-like feet, <span
id="fr_337"></span>[4](#fn_337)

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

Are able to keep their promise of conquest,  
And to gain victory over their enemies in battle--  
Such, without a doubt, are sheltered in Thy lap.  
But their enemies who send forth the defiant challenge,  
"I am a Deva, and none is equal to me in the whole world,"  
Perish and meet such death as befits them.

7

Bhūta, Preta, Piśācha, Rākṣasa,  
Daitya, foremost of Dānava, Yakṣa, Lords of Naga, <span
id="fr_338"></span>[1](#fn_338)  
Wrathful Dākinī, <span id="fr_339"></span>[2](#fn_339) great
birds, <span id="fr_340"></span>[3](#fn_340) tigers, and other dreadful
creatures  
Forthwith take flight at but the remembrance of Thy name,  
And are powerless to do aught of evil.

8

Who serves Thy lotus feet, to him *siddhi* <span
id="fr_341"></span>[4](#fn_341) is given.  
He surpasses the Lord of speech, <span id="fr_342"></span>[5](#fn_342)  
And obtains the beauty of Kāma. <span id="fr_343"></span>[6](#fn_343)  
He can charm and paralyze <span id="fr_344"></span>[7](#fn_344)
multitudes of elephants upon the field of battle,

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

And has power to stay the flow of water. <span
id="fr_345"></span>[1](#fn_345)  
The Siddha <span id="fr_346"></span>[2](#fn_346) and prosperity are
under his control.

### PHALAŚLOKA. <span id="fr_347"></span>[3](#fn_347)

Whoever, being pure and self-controlled,  
Reads this eight-versed hymn to Tārā,  
At morn, at noon, at evening,  
To him is given  
The power to write beautifully in prose or verse, <span
id="fr_348"></span>[4](#fn_348)  
Knowledge in all *Śāstra*,  
Imperishable fortune,  
The enjoyment of whatsoever he may desire,  
Fame, beauty, and wealth,  
The love of all men,  
And at the end liberation.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_321"></span>[56:1](htg11.htm#fr_321) The Matsyasūkta,
Tārārṇava, and Nīla Tantras deal with particulars or Tārā or Tāriṇī, one
of the Mahāvidyā, whose *bīja* is *Hrīm Strīm*, *Hūm* (*Kurccha*),
*Phat* (see verse 4). She is called Nīlasarasvatī, because She playfully
gives the power of speech. She is called Tārā on account of her being
deliverer or saviour (*tārakatvāt*). She gives both pleasure (*sukha*)
and liberation (*mokṣa*). She is called also Ugratārā, because She saves
from formidable and horrible calamities. Ṛṣi Vaśiṣṭha is said to have
cursed this *vidyā*, and then raised the curse so that *siddhi* might be
gained from Her by *japa* of the *bīja Hrīm*, *Strīm*, *Hūm*, *Phat*,
after which She again became glorious. Her Mantra is also given as
*Śrīm*, *Hrīm*, *Strīm*, *Hūm*, *Phat* (giver of wealth and beauty);
another is *Hrīm*, *Hrīm*, *Strīm*, *Hūm*, *Phat* (giver of all
desires); another is *Aim*, *Hrīm*, *Strīm*, *Hūm*, *Phat* (giver of
speech), and *Hrīm*, *Strīm*, *Hūm*, *Phat* (giver of liberation). Her
Yantra is an eight-petalled lotus surrounded by a circle, with inverted
triangle in the centre with *Hūm*. On the petals are *Hrīm*, *Strīm*,
*Śrīm*, *Hūm*. There is also a Tantra (*Tārāṣatkoṇa*) of two
superimposed triangles, making a star.

<span id="fn_322"></span>[56:2](htg11.htm#fr_322) From the Nīla Tantra
(see also Tantrasāra, p. 610, R. M. Chatterjee's edition, and the
Brihatstotraratnākara, p. 283, where a more correct text is given).

<span id="fn_323"></span>[56:3](htg11.htm#fr_323) The blue Sarasvatī,
Devī of speech (see note 1, *ante*). Nīla Tantra says She is in the form
of all language (*sarvabhāṣā ayī*). The Nīlasarasvatī Yantra is figured
at p. 93 of the Dashamahāvidyā.

<span id="fn_324"></span>[57:1](htg11.htm#fr_324) *Karttri* (for
*dhyāna* see p. 94 Daśamahāvidyā).

<span id="fn_325"></span>[57:2](htg11.htm#fr_325) As did the celestial
*Kalpa* tree in Indra's heaven.

<span id="fn_326"></span>[57:3](htg11.htm#fr_326) Material success,
psychical powers, spiritual attainment.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[57:4](htg11.htm#fr_327) Spouse of Śiva
(Sharbha).

<span id="fn_328"></span>[58:1](htg11.htm#fr_328) Her *dhyāna* is given
as follows: The Devī is in the midst of four blazing funeral pyres; Her
feet as described in verse 1; formidable, with garland of severed heads;
short of stature; big-bellied; tiger skin round the waist; youthful;
four-armed; protruding tongue; giving *vara*; holding the articles
mentioned in verse 1 (the skull and lotus in left hands); a *ṛṣi*
Akshobhya in the form of a serpent on her head; her body lustrous as
that of the moonbeams; formidable teeth; smiling face; three eyes
blazing like the morning sun.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[58:2](htg11.htm#fr_329) *Māyānanga
vikārarūpalalane*.

<span id="fn_330"></span>[58:3](htg11.htm#fr_330)
*Ardhacandrātmike*--that is, the crescent sign below the bindu in
*candra bindu*. She is both bindu and Nāda (see Introduction). It is
also said that there are eight *varṇa* above the *bindu* of *Hrīm*,
commencing with *ardhacandra*, and ending with *unmani*, of which the
third is Nāda. Here, as the Mahāsvachchanda Tantra states, the Devī
should be contemplated.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[58:4](htg11.htm#fr_331) Two tantrik *bīja
mantras*: as to *Hūm* (see , note 1, *ante*). *Phat* is the *astra* or
weapon *mantra* (see note 1, [p. 50](htg09.htm#page_50), *ante*).

<span id="fn_332"></span>[58:5](htg11.htm#fr_332) *Mantrātmike* (see [p.
2](htg03.htm#page_2), *ante*).

<span id="fn_333"></span>[58:6](htg11.htm#fr_333) *Vedanāngnahigocharā*,
as to her three forms (*vide ante*).

<span id="fn_334"></span>[59:1](htg11.htm#fr_334) Literally, "becoming
one with the Deity." Identification of the self and the Deity with
attributes; one of the four forms of qualified liberation--*Sālokya*,
*Sārūpya*, *Sāmīpya*, *Sāyujya*. Those who know the Brahman and such
worship to be imperfect reject them, and attain the unconditioned bliss
(*kaivalya*) which transcends all other states. But these others must be
passed before the end is reached, which the Śaktirahasya summarizes by a
short verse: "A mortal who worships by ceremonies, by images, by mind,
by identification, by knowing the self attains *kaivalya*."

<span id="fn_335"></span>[59:2](htg11.htm#fr_335) That is Parameśvara,
in whom the threefold energies which manifest in the *trimūrti* are
contained *tasyastri parameśvari trinayanabrahmādi samnyātmanah*.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[59:3](htg11.htm#fr_336) The Deva, in this like
man, is a *samsārin* or inhabitant [of](errata.htm#6) the *samsāra*,
which comprises earth, the *antarikṣa*, and heaven (*svarga*), the abode
of the Deva. The latter has wife and children, is engaged in conflict
with demons, and so forth. When the merit which gains the Deva heaven is
exhausted, he descends to earth again.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[59:4](htg11.htm#fr_337) That is, the Deva bow
their heads at the feet of the Devī, receiving on their heads the dust
of Her feet.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[60:1](htg11.htm#fr_338) Various spirits and
inferior divinities of more or less evil and malignant character.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[60:2](htg11.htm#fr_339) A form of Śakti
attendant on the Devī in Her terrible forms.

<span id="fn_340"></span>[60:3](htg11.htm#fr_340) *Khacara* (vultures,
eagles, etc.).

<span id="fn_341"></span>[60:4](htg11.htm#fr_341) Vide *ante*, [p.
57](#page_57), note 3,

<span id="fn_342"></span>[60:5](htg11.htm#fr_342) Brihaspati.

<span id="fn_343"></span>[60:6](htg11.htm#fr_343) Deva of Love.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[60:7](htg11.htm#fr_344) He has the powers of
*mohanam* and *stambhanam*, the latter being one of the *Tāntrika
Ṣatkarma*.

<span id="fn_345"></span>[61:1](htg11.htm#fr_345) A particular form of
*Stambhanam* called *jalastambha*.

<span id="fn_346"></span>[61:2](htg11.htm#fr_346) Devayoni of that name
inhabiting the *antarikṣa*.

<span id="fn_347"></span>[61:3](htg11.htm#fr_347) Fruit or result of the
stotra.

<span id="fn_348"></span>[61:4](htg11.htm#fr_348) *Labhate devyām
kavitvām*.
