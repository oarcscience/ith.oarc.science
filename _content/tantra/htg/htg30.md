### YAMUNA <span id="fr_1191"></span>[1](#fn_1185)

### (YAMUNĀṢṬAKAM)

1

MAY the daughter of Kalinda <span id="fr_1192"></span>[2](#fn_1186) ever
cleanse my mind of its impurity,  
She whose waters, beauteous as the black body of the enemy <span
id="fr_1193"></span>[3](#fn_1187) of Mura, <span
id="fr_1194"></span>[4](#fn_1188)  
Cleanse the overgrowth of plants <span id="fr_1195"></span>[5](#fn_1189)
and shrubs which line its pleasant banks.  
Indra's heaven compared with Thy waters is but a thing of straw.  
Destructress of the sorrow of the three worlds--  
*Dhunotu me manomalam Kalindanandinī sadā*. <span
id="fr_1196"></span>[6](#fn_1190)

2

May the daughter of Kalinda ever cleanse my mind of its impurity,  
She whose stream is highly adorned with over-flowing water  
Destructress of sin, dark as night, like unto nectar,

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

Greatly powerful for the destruction of all great sins,  
Beneficent One who is black of colour,  
Through company with the body of the good son of Nanda <span
id="fr_1197"></span>[1](#fn_1191)  
*Dhunotu me manomalam Kalindanandinī sadā*.

3

May the daughter of Kalinda ever cleanse my mind of its impurity,  
The touch of whose shining waves washes away the sins of multitudes of
beings.  
Devoted to Thee is the *Cātaka* bird, <span
id="fr_1198"></span>[2](#fn_1192) receptacle  
that Thou art of freshness and sweetness. <span
id="fr_1199"></span>[3](#fn_1193)  
Giver of desire,  
On the borders of whose banks swans ever dwell,  
*Dhunotu me manomalam Kalindanandinī sadā*.

4

May the daughter of Kalinda ever cleanse my mind of its impurity.  
The gentle breeze on Her banks dispels the lassitude  
Of those who have rambled and played <span
id="fr_1200"></span>[4](#fn_1194) thereon.  
The beauty of Her waters is beyond the power of words;  
It is, indeed, the consortment with Her current,

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

Which purifies all rivers, male and female, <span
id="fr_1201"></span>[1](#fn_1195) on the earth.  
*Dhunotu me manomalam Kalindanandinī sadā*,

5

May the daughter of Kalinda ever cleanse my mind of its impurity,  
Destroyed by (the whiteness of) Her sandy banks laved by Her waters;  
She who is ever white, <span id="fr_1202"></span>[2](#fn_1196)  
Adorned with blossoms beauteous as the rays of the autumn moon. <span
id="fr_1203"></span>[3](#fn_1197)  
May She then purify me by Her waters,  
Most excellent that they are for the worship of Bhava, <span
id="fr_1204"></span>[4](#fn_1198)  
(By her white splendour), <span id="fr_1205"></span>[5](#fn_1199)
Destructress of the darkness of night <span
id="fr_1206"></span>[6](#fn_1200)  
*Dhunotu me manomalam Kalindanandinī sadā*.

6

May the daughter of Kalinda ever cleanse my mind of its impurity.  
The paste and unguents of the beauteous Rādhikā <span
id="fr_1207"></span>[7](#fn_1201)  
Colours Her waters in which Rādhikā plays.

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

Possessor is She of the body of the husband <span
id="fr_1208"></span>[1](#fn_1202) of Rādhikā,  
Which by none other may be possessed.  
Skilled is She in making Her way through the seven sleeping oceans,  
And in filling them with waters <span
id="fr_1209"></span>[2](#fn_1203)--  
*Dhunotu me manomalam Kalindanandinī sadā*.

7

May the daughter of Kalinda ever cleanse my mind of its impurity!  
Her stream is beauteous with the women of the cowherds, <span
id="fr_1210"></span>[3](#fn_1204)  
Made passionate <span id="fr_1211"></span>[4](#fn_1205) by the scent of
the paste and unguent,  
Dropped therein from off the body of Acyuta, <span
id="fr_1212"></span>[5](#fn_1206)  
Garlanded is She with clusters of Champak flowers,

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

Set in the flowing <span id="fr_1213"></span>[1](#fn_1207) hair of
Rādhikā.  
Of all such as come to bathe in Her waters  
Neither is one the servant nor the other master. <span
id="fr_1214"></span>[2](#fn_1208)  
*Dhunotu me manomalam Kalindanandinī sadā*.

8

May the daughter of Kalinda ever cleanse my mind of its impurity!  
Pleasant always is She with groves,  
Where Nandanandi <span id="fr_1215"></span>[3](#fn_1209) ever
played. <span id="fr_1216"></span>[4](#fn_1210)  
Bright is She with the ripened blossom  
Of the *kadamba* <span id="fr_1217"></span>[5](#fn_1211) and
*mallika* <span id="fr_1218"></span>[6](#fn_1212) flowers upon Her
banks.  
It is She who safely carries across the ocean of the world <span
id="fr_1219"></span>[7](#fn_1213)  
All such men as bathe in Her stream.  
*Dhunotu me manomalam Kalindanandinī sadā*.

translated in the first line.

<span id="fn_1191"></span>[191:1](htg30.htm#fr_1197) The cowherd who
brought up Śrīkṛṣṇa, when his life was threatened by Kamsa.

<span id="fn_1192"></span>[191:2](htg30.htm#fr_1198) As to which see [p.
184](htg29.htm#page_184), note 7.

<span id="fn_1193"></span>[191:3](htg30.htm#fr_1199) Literally, "who are
slaves to Her by reason of their inhabitancy of Her banks"

<span id="fn_1194"></span>[191:4](htg30.htm#fr_1200) After the
*rāsalīlā* Śrīkṛṣṇa and the *Gopīs* are tired by their dance and play,
and are refreshed by repose upon Her banks where gentle breezes blow.

<span id="fn_1195"></span>[192:1](htg30.htm#fr_1201) Rivers are either
male (*nada*) or female (*nadī*). Of the former class are the Sone,
Sindu, etc., and of the latter Gangā, Narmadā, Gandakī, etc.

<span id="fn_1196"></span>[192:2](htg30.htm#fr_1202) Her sandy banks are
so.

<span id="fn_1197"></span>[192:3](htg30.htm#fr_1203) Of a soft and
silvery white.

<span id="fn_1198"></span>[192:4](htg30.htm#fr_1204) For use in the
ritual worship of Śiva.

<span id="fn_1199"></span>[192:5](htg30.htm#fr_1205) *Malam*
(*manomalam*). Impurity is a thing which is dark. The river by the white
splendour of its white banks and blossoms is therewith contrasted.

<span id="fn_1200"></span>[192:6](htg30.htm#fr_1206) For luminously
white is She like the moon.

<span id="fn_1201"></span>[192:7](htg30.htm#fr_1207) The beloved of
Śrīkṛṣṇa.

<span id="fn_1202"></span>[193:1](htg30.htm#fr_1208) Śrīkṛṣṇa; for He
too bathes in her stream, which possesses also His dark colour.

<span id="fn_1203"></span>[193:2](htg30.htm#fr_1209) Alluding to the
destruction of the Asuras, called Kālakeya. These excluded the Devas
from *svarga*. On their chiefs bring slain by Indra, they betook
themselves to the depths of the ocean, whence they issued at night to
destroy the *Ṛṣis*. The latter asked the aid of Viṣṇu, who told them to
go to Agastya. He at one sip swallowed all the oceans, which thus
disappeared (therefore "sleeping oceans" of text) until the River Ganges
was brought down by Bhagīratha when they were again filled with Her
waters. This incident is attributed to the Yamunā, both rivers being
manifestations of the same Devī.

<span id="fn_1204"></span>[193:3](htg30.htm#fr_1210) Literally, *Ali*,
which, according to the Amarakośa = *Sakhi*; female friend, referring to

senses were roused by the scent of the pastes which had fallen from the
scented body of Kṛṣṇa.

<span id="fn_1206"></span>[193:5](htg30.htm#fr_1212) Kṛṣṇa
("imperishable one").

<span id="fn_1207"></span>[194:1](htg30.htm#fr_1213) *Vilola*. Her hair
is dishevelled and moving in the movements of breeze and play.

<span id="fn_1208"></span>[194:2](htg30.htm#fr_1214) Literally, "In the
case of those who come down to bathe in Her waters She ever destroys all
righteousness of master and servant"--that is, all are equal in Her
waters which purify all without distinction.

<span id="fn_1209"></span>[194:3](htg30.htm#fr_1215) The text has
*Nandinandana*, but this has no meaning. *Nandanandi* is He who pleases
Nanda or Kṛṣṇa, whose foster-father Nanda the cowherd was.

<span id="fn_1210"></span>[194:4](htg30.htm#fr_1216) With the *Gopī*
women.

<span id="fn_1211"></span>[194:5](htg30.htm#fr_1217) A beautiful
flowering tree with yellow blooms under, and on which (as when he stole
the garments of the bathing Gopīs) Kṛṣṇa played (See [p.
169](htg27.htm#page_169), note 2).

<span id="fn_1212"></span>[194:6](htg30.htm#fr_1218) A kind of Jasmine.
