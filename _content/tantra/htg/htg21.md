Who is the life and strength <span id="fr_785"></span>[3](#fn_780) and
cause of all.  
Knower of the distinction between Puruṣa and Prakṛti, <span
id="fr_786"></span>[4](#fn_781)  
And who is both black <span id="fr_787"></span>[5](#fn_782) and
grey, <span id="fr_788"></span>[6](#fn_783) reverence for ever.

We prostrate ourselves before Thee, who art at once most gentle <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_761"></span>[126:1](htg21.htm#fr_766) Here not the "Great
Goddess," but as Commentator Nagoji Bhatta (cited post as NḄ.) says,
"The Goddess" (Devī) "of the great"--viz., Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Śiva, for
it is by Her power that they enjoy their abode, and it is She whom even
they worship--the Mother of all.

<span id="fn_762"></span>[126:2](htg21.htm#fr_767) The Asuras Śumbha and
Niśumbha bereft the Devas of their dominion whereupon the latter prayed
to the Goddess for help as follows.

<span id="fn_763"></span>[126:3](htg21.htm#fr_768) Nagoji says that Devī
= *prakāśātmika*, that which is by its nature light and manifestation.

<span id="fn_764"></span>[126:4](htg21.htm#fr_769) *Mahādevī* (see note
1, *ante*).

<span id="fn_765"></span>[126:5](htg21.htm#fr_770) Because She is the
cause of all auspicious things.

<span id="fn_766"></span>[126:6](htg21.htm#fr_771) *Śṛṣṭiśakti*, or
*śakti* (power) of creation (N. B).

<span id="fn_767"></span>[126:7](htg21.htm#fr_772) *Bhadrāyai*.
Literally, good = *rakṣanaśakti*, the *Vaiṣṇavaśakti*, which maintains
(N. B.).

<span id="fn_768"></span>[127:1](htg21.htm#fr_773) *Nityāyai*; or She is
the Śakti Nitya (N. B.).

<span id="fn_769"></span>[127:2](htg21.htm#fr_774) That is, She is
*samhāraśakti* or *śakti* of dissolution, the *tāmasika śakti*
(according the Commentator Gopal Chakravarti), as contrasted with
Dhātrī, the *rājasika śakti*, and *indorūpā* (moon form), the *sāttvika
śakti* (*vide post*).

<span id="fn_770"></span>[127:3](htg21.htm#fr_775) Daughter of Guru, the
Lord of the Mountains.

<span id="fn_771"></span>[127:4](htg21.htm#fr_776) Creator and upholder.

<span id="fn_772"></span>[127:5](htg21.htm#fr_777) The moon here stands
for all luminous things: or it may mean *indorūpā* in the technical
sense of *yoga śāstra*.

<span id="fn_773"></span>[127:6](htg21.htm#fr_778) *Sukhā* =
*paramānandarūpā*.

<span id="fn_774"></span>[127:7](htg21.htm#fr_779) That is,
*aṇimādirūpā* (G. C.), the eight *siddhis*--*aṇimā*, *laghima*, etc.

<span id="fn_775"></span>[127:8](htg21.htm#fr_780) Gopal Chakravarti
says this means *Rākṣasaśakti* (demonic power); also *alakṣmī*
(misfortune). At the time of worship [of](errata.htm#14) Lakṣmī (Devī of
Prosperity) on the fifth day after *vijayadaśamī*, the Devī Alakṣmī is
worshipped in the house in the form of a misshapen figure, and then
thrown away.

<span id="fn_776"></span>[127:9](htg21.htm#fr_781) *Bhubritām*, which,
according to G. C., means mountains, for wealth in the form of gems,
etc., are found therein.

<span id="fn_777"></span>[127:10](htg21.htm#fr_782) Maheśvarī or
Śivaśakti.

<span id="fn_778"></span>[128:1](htg21.htm#fr_783) Which means,
according to Nagoji: "She who is known with difficulty (*duhkhajneyā*).

<span id="fn_779"></span>[128:2](htg21.htm#fr_784) As N. B. says:
*Durgātsamsārātpārāngkaroti*, etc. G. C. says it means She whose abode
is not known in either time or space.

<span id="fn_780"></span>[128:3](htg21.htm#fr_785) For She is not only
*antaryāminī*, but remains even at the time of dissolution. She is
feminine because She supports all things as their mother.

<span id="fn_781"></span>[128:4](htg21.htm#fr_786)
*Khyatihprakritipuruṣayor bhedajnānām* (N. B.). *Viveka khyātih* is a
term in Sānkhya denoting the cause of liberation, the recognition of the
self (Puruṣa) by the self; not as one published rendering runs, "to
fame;"

<span id="fn_782"></span>[128:5](htg21.htm#fr_787) As *tāmasika śakti*.

<span id="fn_783"></span>[128:6](htg21.htm#fr_788) *Dhūmra*; that which
is with smoke; the sacrificial rite; here the knowledge of the rites.

<span id="fn_784"></span>[128:7](htg21.htm#fr_789) *Atisaubhāgyā*. As
such She is (N. B.) *vidyārūpinī*, as putting an end to the *samsāra*.
For this reason She, as G. C. says, greatly delights all.

<span id="fn_785"></span>[128:8](htg21.htm#fr_790) *Atiraudrāyā*,
because, as N. B. says, She, as *avidyā*, is the cause of the samsāra
with all its terrors.

<span id="fn_786"></span>[129:1](htg21.htm#fr_791) *Jagatpratishtāyai* =
(as N. B. says) *jagadupādānakāraṇam*; or, as, G. C. has it, She is
*sarvāntaryāminī*, who dwells in the inmost being of all things.

<span id="fn_787"></span>[129:2](htg21.htm#fr_792) Which = (G. C.)
*dyotanaśīla*, whose nature it is to lighten, or (N.) *devaśakti*.

<span id="fn_788"></span>[129:3](htg21.htm#fr_793) Or *mulāvidyā*
(Nagoji).

<span id="fn_789"></span>[129:4](htg21.htm#fr_794) *Namastasyai,
namastasyai, namastasyai namo namah*. The refrain throughout the
succeeding verses.

<span id="fn_790"></span>[129:5](htg21.htm#fr_795) *Cetana* = (Nagoji
says) *chitśakti*, or mind. She Herself is *nirvikalpacitśakti*, but
manifests as *savikalpacitśakti* in all worldly beings.

<span id="fn_791"></span>[129:6](htg21.htm#fr_796) The mind, as the
aspect so named of the *antahkaraṇa*.

<span id="fn_792"></span>[130:1](htg21.htm#fr_797) *Nidrārūpena*.
According to Nagoji, *nidrā* = *suṣupti*, the state of dreamless sleep
where all sense functions are at an end. According to G. C., *svapna* or
dreaming sleep also.

<span id="fn_793"></span>[130:2](htg21.htm#fr_798) Nagoji says this
word=*samsāratāpābhāvah*, or lack of worldly pain. The *samsāra* is like
a burning flame. In its shadow there is coolness and peace. According to
Gopal Chakravarti, however, it = *ātapābhāvah*. *Ātapāh* =
*prakāśarūpatvātvidyā*, or knowledge on account of its giving light, and
therefore as the lack of it She is *avidyā*.

<span id="fn_794"></span>[130:3](htg21.htm#fr_799) *Śakt*i: power,
action.

<span id="fn_795"></span>[131:1](htg21.htm#fr_800) Which, as Nagoji
says, is the desire for that which is not one's own (*anātmīyā*); thirst
for enjoyment, possession, individual life, etc.

<span id="fn_796"></span>[131:2](htg21.htm#fr_801) Which is the desire
not to return evil to those who have done us wrong, notwithstanding our
power to do so (N. B.).

<span id="fn_797"></span>[131:3](htg21.htm#fr_802) *Jātīrūpeṇa*: that
which classifies and differentiates one body of beings from another.

<span id="fn_798"></span>[131:4](htg21.htm#fr_803) Which Nagoji says
means the control of the senses and renunciation of all worldly things.

<span id="fn_799"></span>[132:1](htg21.htm#fr_804) That is, Nagoji says,
*āstikatvam* (belief in God's existence); or, according to Gopal
Chakravarti, also a firm and strong faith in Veda.

<span id="fn_800"></span>[132:2](htg21.htm#fr_805) Wealth, etc.

<span id="fn_801"></span>[132:3](htg21.htm#fr_806) That is, *jīvikā*,
the callings of husbandmen, merchant, cattle-rearing, etc.

<span id="fn_802"></span>[133:1](htg21.htm#fr_807) Which Nagoji says is
the desire of removing the pain of others.

<span id="fn_803"></span>[133:2](htg21.htm#fr_808) Which Nagoji defines
as satisfaction with that which one possesses as distinguished from
longing for what one has not got.

<span id="fn_804"></span>[133:3](htg21.htm#fr_809) She is *jananī*, and,
as Nagoji says, *pālayitrī* (protectress).

<span id="fn_805"></span>[133:4](htg21.htm#fr_810) *Bhrānti*. A
thoroughly Indian conception, though some modern Hindus have lost the
sense of it. Gopal Chakravarti gives as an example the classical
instance of the *jīva* taking mother-of-pearl to be silver, etc.

<span id="fn_806"></span>[134:1](htg21.htm#fr_811) *Cit* = *citśakti*
(N. B.), and according to Gopal Chakravarti, who says the *jīva* is here
meant, *caitanya*.

<span id="fn_807"></span>[134:2](htg21.htm#fr_812) Indra.

<span id="fn_808"></span>[134:3](htg21.htm#fr_813) Queen and Ruler of
the worlds.

<span id="fn_809"></span>[134:4](htg21.htm#fr_814) The Good Devas.

<span id="fn_810"></span>[134:5](htg21.htm#fr_815) Their evil enemies.
