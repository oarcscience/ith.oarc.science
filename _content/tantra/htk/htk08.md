### VERSE 4

O DESTRUCTRESS of the sins of the three worlds, auspicious <span
id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34) Kālikā, who in Thy upper lotus-like left
hand holdest a sword. <span id="fr_35"></span>[2](#fn_35) and in the
lower left hand a severed head; <span id="fr_36"></span>[3](#fn_36) who
with Thy upper right hand maketh the gesture which dispels fear, <span
id="fr_37"></span>[4](#fn_37) and with Thy lower right hand that which
grants boons; they, O Mother with gaping mouth, <span
id="fr_38"></span>[5](#fn_38) who reciting Thy name, meditate in this
way <span id="fr_39"></span>[6](#fn_39) upon the greatness of Thy
mantra, possess the eight great powers <span
id="fr_40"></span>[7](#fn_40) of the Three-Eyed One <span
id="fr_41"></span>[8](#fn_41) in the palm of their hands. <span
id="fr_42"></span>[9](#fn_42)

COMMENTARY

*'Sword' (Kṛpāṇam)*

The sword is knowledge (Jñāna) by which the bonds of ignorance of the
desire-free Sādhaka are severed. See Śivadharmottara.

*'Severed head' (Chinna-muṇdaṁ)*

The human head is the seat of Tattvajñāṇa free of attachment.

*'Terrible countenance' (Prakatita-radane)*

Her white teeth indicative of the white self-manifesting Sattva-Guṇa
bite the red lolling tongue indicative of Rajas Guṇa and suppress both
Rajas and Tamas by Sattva.

*'Precious Mantrās' (Manu-vi-bhavaṁ)*

The three 'Krīṁ' Bījas represent the Cidghana aspect of Devī, the two
Hūm Bījas the Sattva-Guṇa aspect and the two 'Hrīm' Bījas the
Rajah-pradhāna-sattva-Guṇa aspect.

\[Durgārāma-Siddhāntavāgīśa explains this in the following different
ways: (*a*) Manuvibhava = the Vibhava or Saṁpatti (precious possession)
of Manus or Mantras. This precious possession is the

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

name in the vocative case 'Dakshiṇe Kālike.' The meaning of the passage
then is that those who recite Thy name Dakshiṇe Kālike, which is the
precious possession of Mantras, and meditate on this Thine appearance
possess the Powers and so forth. (*b*) Manuvibhava is the Vibhava of the
Manu that is the twenty-two syllabled Mantra of Kālī. This possession is
the name Dakshiṇā Kālikā. (*c*) Manuvibhava = Manu (Mantra) vibhava
(Ghataka) of which (the Devī's body) is the body of which Mantra is the
generator. The bodies of the Devatās are produced by their Mantras. The
passage thus means that, they who recite Thy name Dakshiṇā Kālikā and
meditate on this Thine appearance generated by Mantra possess the
virtues mentioned above.\]

See last Verse.

*Kālikā (Kālike)*

*'Three eyed one (Tryaṁbaka)'*

\[The same commentator (Durgārāma) offers three explanations of the term
Tryaṁbaka used for Śiva (*a*) He who has three Aṁbakas or eyes is
Tryaṁbaka, (*b*) He who has three Mothers or Aṁbās is Tryaṁbaka. The
Kālikāpurāṇa says, 'As Hara is born of three Mothers He is known, even
amongst Devas, by the title Tryaṁbaka.' (*c*) Todala-Tantra says 'the
Vidyā Bhuvaneśvarī is in Heaven, Earth, and the Nether world (Pātāla).
He who delights in the Devī as threefold in three places is called
Tryaṁbaka. He is with Śakti and is worshipped in all Tantras.'\]

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_34"></span>[53:1](htk08.htm#fr_34) <span id="page_54">p.
54</span> *Dakshiṇā*, the beneficent grantor of *Nirvāṇa*. (V)

<span id="fn_35"></span>[53:2](htk08.htm#fr_35) *Khadga*, the peculiar
heavy sword with the blade curved at the tip so named, used to behead
the sacrificial animals.

<span id="fn_36"></span>[53:3](htk08.htm#fr_36) The Devī is the
destroyer of the wicked.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[53:4](htk08.htm#fr_37) The Devī is the
dispeller of all fear, and makes with Her hand the *mudrā*. The right
upper hand makes the gesture of dispelling fear, or the gesture of
assurance of safety (*Abhayamudrā*) and the right lower hand makes the
gesture of granting boons (*Varamudrā*). (V) The *Sādhaka* seeks
fearlessness, which is the great gift of the Goddess, who is
*Bhayāpahā*, 'remover of fear.' 'If thou art remembered in times of
<span id="page_55">p. 55</span> difficulty, Thou takest away all fear'
(Mārkaṇdeya-Purāṇa). At the same time it is she who fills the ignorant
with terror (Paśuloka-bhayaṁkarī) that is, those devoid of the knowledge
of non-duality, for 'fear comes when there is duality' (Br. Up. 1-4-2,
Lalitā, v. 99).

<span id="fn_38"></span>[53:5](htk08.htm#fr_38) *Prakatita-vadane* (see
'*Daśa-Mahāvidyā Upāsanārahasya*,' by Prasanna-Kumāra-Śāstrī).
*Vimalānanda* reads *Prakatitaradane*, that is, with big protruding
teeth. The *Yoginī-Tantra* says, 'Supreme eternal, large-toothed,
smeared with blood.' The *Tārākalpa* speaks of '*Syāmā* of the colour of
a new (freshly formed) cloud, with large breasts, terrible with
protruding teeth.' (V)

<span id="fn_39"></span>[53:6](htk08.htm#fr_39) As stated—that is,
*Krīṁ Krīṁ Krīṁ Hūṁ Hūṁ Hrīṁ Hrīṁ* which with *Dakṣiṇe* makes ten
syllables.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[53:7](htk08.htm#fr_40) *Siddhi*—that is,
*Aṇimā*, *Laghimā*, *Garimā*, *Prāpti*, *Prākāṁya*, *Iśitva*, *Vaśitva*,
*Kāmāvasāyitā* the power of becoming small, great, heavy, light, etc.,
which are inherent in Īśvara, and are attainable by Yogis who become
Īśvara and gain *Āiśvarya*. By realization of the self, that Divine
state which is the universal Self is manifested, as also the eightfold
manifestation of the Divine power.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[53:8](htk08.htm#fr_41) *Tryaṁbaka* or *Śiva*.
According to Tarkālaṁkāra's Commentary on Mahānirvāṇa-Tantra,
*Tryaṁbaka* means the father of the three Devas, Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and
Rudra. The *Ṛgvidhāna* uses it as an equivalent of Mahādeva. The
Mahānirvāṇa-Tantra says: 'As She surveys the entire universe, which is
the product of time, with Her three eyes—the Moon, Sun, and
Fire—therefore She is endowed with three eyes' (*Ullāsa* xiii, verse 8)
The Moon, Sun, and Fire are the *Icchā*, *Kriyā*, *Jñāna* and other
*Śaktis* (see the Ṣatcakranirūpaṅa of Pūrnānaṇda-Śvāmī) and Serpent
Power by A. Avalon.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[53:9](htk08.htm#fr_42) 'By him who carries a
flower its odour is enjoyed without seeking. By him who looks upon
himself as the universal Self the powers (of Brahmā, etc.) are enjoyed'
(Commentary of Sureśvarācārya on tenth Sloka of *Dakṣināmūrti Stotra*).
