### VERSE 22

NUMBERS of women with large eyes, like those of the antelope, <span
id="fr_160"></span>[1](#fn_160) impatient for his love, ever follow him.
Even the King becomes subject to his control. He becomes like unto
Kuvera <span id="fr_161"></span>[2](#fn_161) himself. An enemy fears him
as if he were a prison. Living in continuous bliss <span
id="fr_162"></span>[3](#fn_162) the devotee is liberated when yet
living, and is never again reborn. <span id="fr_163"></span>[4](#fn_163)

Here ends the Hymn by Śrī Mahākāla, entitled *Karpūrādistotra*.

COMMENTARY

*'Liberated' (Jīvanmukta)*

And on death gets Videhamukti.

*'No rebirth' (Muktah pratijanuh)*

He gets Nirvāṇa in Brahman. The Mahākāla-saṁhitā says, 'Whoever
constantly and with devotion reads this Hymn originating from Mahākāla,
is free from danger, disease and death and in the end attains Kaivalya
liberation.'

*Here ends the Hymn named Svarūpastotra of Śrīmatī  
Dakṣiṇa-Kālikā by Śrīmān Mahākāla*.

*Here also ends its annotation and Svarūpavyākhyā  
entitled Vimalānandadāyini*.

OBEISANCE

To Kālī the spouse of Kāla, who destroys all sin and is Kāla. <span
id="fr_164"></span>[1](#fn_164) She who is Tārā the Saviour the Supreme
Brahmavidyā who is adored by the Lotus-born Deva. <span
id="fr_165"></span>[2](#fn_165)

She who is Śrīvidyā, desirous of the welfare of Sādhakas, on the path of
Liberation, to whom Hari and Hara <span id="fr_166"></span>[3](#fn_166)
make obeisance.

May that Devī the Mother, who appears in the form of all things, bring
forth benefits for all such as sing Her praises.

COLOPHON

Of this King of Hymns wherein Mahākāla has described the true self of
Kālikā, the Karpūrādya Hymn, untainted by worldly desire, which gives
bliss to Devotees, the aforesaid Annotation containing its simple
interpretation, as well as the Svarūpavyākhyā (Commentary) which gives
pure joy was prepared by me Vimalānanda Svāmī for the enlightenment of
Sādhakas in the Saka year 1837. Mayest Thou reside in the throat of him
who reads it.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_160"></span>[94:1](htk26.htm#fr_160) *Kuraṅga*, which has
beautiful large eyes.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[94:2](htk26.htm#fr_161) Lord of wealth.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[94:3](htk26.htm#fr_162) <span id="page_95">p.
95</span> *Kelikalayā*, by the various entertaining acts
(*parihāsādinā*) of which there are sixty-four. The meaning here is that
there is continuous bliss.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[94:4](htk26.htm#fr_163) *Kelihalayā ciraṁ
jivanmuktah sa bhavati ca bhakhtah pratijanuh*, The translation in the
text reads *pratijanuh* to mean as K. B. says, *Janmanivritti* or
cessation of birth. But *Pratijanuh* may also mean 'birth after birth.'
According to this translation *jivanmukta* would not refer to the state
immediately preceding Kaivalya but, as K.B. says,
*Jivadavasthānubhūtadevatā-sākṣātkāra-mukha* in which case the
translation will be, He living in continuous bliss obtains direct
Experience of the Devatā and is reborn life after life as Her devotee.
According to the translation adopted complete liberation follows and in
the other case some lower though happy state.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[95:1](htk26.htm#fr_164) The first Kāla is
Mahākāla and the second is the produced Kāla.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[95:2](htk26.htm#fr_165) Brahmā.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[95:3](htk26.htm#fr_166) Viṣṇu and Rudra.
