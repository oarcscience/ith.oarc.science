### VERSE 19

O DARK One, <span id="fr_141"></span>[1](#fn_141) wondrous and excelling
in every way, <span id="fr_142"></span>[2](#fn_142) becomes the
accomplishment, <span id="fr_143"></span>[3](#fn_143) of those
worshippers <span id="fr_144"></span>[4](#fn_144) who living in this
world <span id="fr_145"></span>[5](#fn_145) freely make offering to Thee
in worship <span id="fr_146"></span>[6](#fn_146) of the greatly <span
id="fr_147"></span>[7](#fn_147) satisfying flesh, together with hair and
bone, <span id="fr_148"></span>[8](#fn_148) of cats, camels,
sheep, <span id="fr_149"></span>[9](#fn_149) buffaloes, goats, and
men. <span id="fr_150"></span>[10](#fn_150)

COMMENTARY

*'Oh Black one' (Asītā)*

Asitā means free from bondage. Sitā means bound. Asitā is therefore 'not
bound' or eternally liberated. The root *So*, means 'to bind.' Amarakośa
gives the meaning of Sita as 'bound.'

*'Wondrous' (Apūrvā)*

Best.

*'At every step' (Pratipadam)*

In succession, step by step.

*'All Powers' (Sarvasiddhi)*

The five Siddhis which are the five forms of Liberation. The Śivagītā
says, 'Sālokya, Sārūpya, Sārṣti, Sāyujya and Kaivalya. Know these to be
the five forms of liberation.'

*'The flesh of' (Palalaṁ)*

These animals represent the Six Enemies (Ripu) or Vices which are
specially characteristic of the following animals: The goat stands for
Lust (Kāma) 'as lustful as a goat (Chhāga),' the buffalo, Anger (Krodha)
'as angry as a buffalo (Mahiṣa),' the cat, Greed (Lobha) 'as greedy as a
cat' (Mārjāra), the sheep, Delusion (Moha), 'as stupid as a sheep'
(Meṣa) the camel, Envy (Mātsarya) 'as envious as a camel' (Uṣtra), Man,
Pride (Mada) 'the Pride and arrogance of man' (Nara).

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

The Ānandākalpa says, 'Worship should be done by making offering of lust
as goat, buffalo, and so forth '. Offering is made to Thee who art
Cidrūpā of lust and other vices as articles of offering (Upacāra) in
worship with the object of ridding oneself of them. Bṛhannīla-Tantra
says, 'In the fire of Ātmā which flames with the ghee (Havih) of Dharma
and Adharma, I ever offer in Homa by the Suṣuṁnā path, with the mind as
ladle, all the functions of the senses—Svāhā.'

*'In worship' (Pūjāyām)*

In mental worship according to the manner prescribed.

*'With hair and bone' (Loma, asthi)*

That is the whole without omitting any part. Such Sādhakas attain the
Sālokya and other forms of liberation.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_141"></span>[89:1](htk23.htm#fr_141) Asitā: That is Kālikā
v. *post*.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[89:2](htk23.htm#fr_142) *Pratipadam*. The
Śyāmarahasya-sārasaṁgraha reads *pratidinam* (every day) (K.B.), which
seems preferable, for, as K.B. says, the worship (*pūjā*) is the general
daily *pūjā*, upon which daily advancement in *siddhi* would follow.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[89:3](htk23.htm#fr_143) *Siddhi*: success in
work; accomplishment of all which is desired (V).

<span id="fn_144"></span>[89:4](htk23.htm#fr_144) *Sat*, that is,
*sādhu* (wise, good, pious). *Satāṁ* = *Sādhakānām* (V).

<span id="fn_145"></span>[89:5](htk23.htm#fr_145) That is, among men.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[89:6](htk23.htm#fr_146) *Pūjāyāṁ api* (see
note [2](#fn_142)), *ante*.

*Pūjāyāṁ*: *Naimittika* or occasional worship (V). The force of the
particle *api* is that the offering is not confined to special *Sādhanā*
but is made in ordinary worship also. (K.B.)

<span id="fn_147"></span>[89:7](htk23.htm#fr_147) *Param* (K.B.).

<span id="fn_148"></span>[89:8](htk23.htm#fr_148) That is flesh and all.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[89:9](htk23.htm#fr_149) *Maiṣaṁ*. The
Śyāmarahasya-sārasaṁgraha gives also *mauṣam*, of rat's flesh. The
Fetkāriṇī-Tantra has both sheep and rat's flesh (K.B.).

*Śyāmārahasya* says, To him who makes offering of the flesh of cats,
sheep, camels, and buffaloes together with bone, hair and skin *Dākṣiṇā*
is ever beneficial like a Mother.'

<span id="fn_150"></span>[89:10](htk23.htm#fr_150) As to this human
sacrifice, K. B. says that Kings alone, and not any other, are entitled
to make human sacrifice, citing the Yāmala quoted in the Kālīkalpalatā
(*Rājā naravaliṁ dadyān nānyopi parameśvari*). For inner sense see
Svarūpa-vyākhyā *post*.
