### VERSE 9

WHAT, indeed, O Mother, <span id="fr_74"></span>[1](#fn_74) can we of so
dull a mind say of Thee whose True Being <span
id="fr_75"></span>[2](#fn_75) not even Dhātā, <span
id="fr_76"></span>[3](#fn_76) Īśa, <span id="fr_77"></span>[4](#fn_77)
or Hari <span id="fr_78"></span>[5](#fn_78) know? Yet, despite our
dullness and ignorance, our devotion towards Thee makes us talk of
Thee. <span id="fr_79"></span>[6](#fn_79) Therefore, O Dark Devī, <span
id="fr_80"></span>[7](#fn_80) forgive this our folly. Anger towards
ignorant creatures such as we, is not befitting Thee <span
id="fr_81"></span>[8](#fn_81).

COMMENTARY

*'Mother'*

Of us all including Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Rudra. In the Devi-Sūkta, Viṣṇu
says, 'One, subtle, and unchanged, and yet many, Thou dost give birth to
millions of worlds. Who am I Viṣṇu, and who is the other Śiva and who
are the Devas that we and they should be able to (fully) sing Thy
praises? ' In the Mārkaṇdeya-Purāṇa, Brahmā says, 'When Viṣṇu, Īśvara
and myself owe our appearance to Thee who has the power to (fitly)
praise Thee?' In Viṣṇuyāmala, Viṣṇu says to Devī 'Oh Mother, none know
Thy supreme aspect. The heavenly ones therefore worship that gross
(Sthūla) aspect of Thine in the form of Kālī and the rest.' The
Mahākāla-saṁhitā says, 'When Dhātā was not, nor Viṣṇu, nor Kāla, when
the five Bhūtas were not, then Thou the Cause wert alone as the Supreme
Brahman, the Being of all that is.'

*(Asite) 'Unlimited'*

She is not limited by the Guṇas and is Nirguṇā.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_74"></span>[66:1](htk13.htm#fr_74) *Jānāmi;* origin of the
three worlds.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[66:2](htk13.htm#fr_75) *Paramaṁ*, or 'reality'
(Commentator K. B).

<span id="fn_76"></span>[66:3](htk13.htm#fr_76) <span id="page_67">p.
67</span> *Dhātā* is *Brahmā* who dispenses the fruits of *Karma*. (V)

<span id="fn_77"></span>[66:4](htk13.htm#fr_77) *Śiva*. *Īśa*: *Rudra*
who wields the power of *Īśvara-hood*. (V)

<span id="fn_78"></span>[66:5](htk13.htm#fr_78) *Hari*: *Viṣnu* who
dispels the threefold sorrows of *Jīvas*. (V)

<span id="fn_79"></span>[66:6](htk13.htm#fr_79) *Tathāpi tvadbhaktir
mukharayati*. *Tathāpi*: still, despite our dullness and ignorance (V)
*Tvadbhaktih*: inclination to sing Thy praises (V). *Mukharayati*:
impels to utter words in praise of Thee (V)

<span id="fn_80"></span>[66:7](htk13.htm#fr_80) This is literal but
According to V *Asite* = unlimited one. Mahākala-saṁhitā says,
'Unthinkable, unlimited, *Śakti* Itself, which is That on which all that
is manifested rests, beyond the *Guṇas*, free of the opposites
(*Dvandva*) to be apprehended only through *Buddhi*: Thyself alone art
Supreme Brahman.' (V)

<span id="fn_81"></span>[66:8](htk13.htm#fr_81) As one does not become
angry with animals (Paśu or animal and ignorant men also called Paśu)
because they do wrong, so do not be angry with us. It is moreover, the
part of the great to overlook the faults of their inferiors
(Commentator. K. B.)
