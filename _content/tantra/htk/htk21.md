COMMENTARY

*'Devotee' (Bhaktah)*

The Sādhaka who is a Yogi on the Divya path.

*'The Abode' (Kusuṁadhanusho mandiram)*

The triangular Yoni Mandala in the Mūlādhāra. Nirvāṇa-Tantra says, 'In
the triangle, the abode of Kāma, the Liṅga is Maheśvara.'

*'With its own flowers'*

Adorned with the Svayaṁbhu-liṅga which is compared to a flower.
Gorakṣa-Samhitā says, 'He is truly wise who knows the supreme Tejas in
the Yoni called Svayaṁbhu-liṅga. Others are but beasts of burden.'

*'Lord of Gandharvas' (Gandharva-śreṇīpatih)*

A great singer. It is said 'there is nothing better than a song,'

*'Poesy' (Kavitvāmṛta-nadi-nadinah)*

He becomes like the great poet Kālidāsa.

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

*'Is great' (Prabhavati)*

He attains Nirvāṇa on being united with Thee who are Saccidānandarūpā.
Kūrma-Purāṇa says, Brahmavādīs have learnt in all Vedas and Vedāntas the
one, omnipresent, subtle (Kūtastha), immovable, absolute, endless,
undecaying Brahman, the sole supreme Niṣkala-Tattva higher than the
highest, eternal, auspicious, wondrous.' Devīgītā says 'Oh Mountain, he
in whom Parabhakti is thus generated becomes merged in Pure
Consciousness.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_125"></span>[83:1](htk21.htm#fr_125) *Bhaktah*: here the
*Vira Sādhaka* (V).

<span id="fn_126"></span>[83:2](htk21.htm#fr_126) *Purah*: that is with
the *Mandala* of *Kāma* before him (V).

<span id="fn_127"></span>[83:3](htk21.htm#fr_127) That is, with
intensity. *Dhyāyan dhyāyan*, repeatedly meditating (V).

<span id="fn_128"></span>[83:4](htk21.htm#fr_128) *Kusuma-dhanuṣo
mandiraṁ*. The Deva with the bow of flowers is Kama whose abode is the
*Madanāgāra*. *Tantrakalpadruma* says, 'He who recites the Mantra ten
thousand times meditating on the flower-covered Yoni
(*Svapuṣpairākīrṇam*) of *Śakti*, of a certainty charms all with his
poesy.' *Svapuṣpa* is called *Svayaṁbhukusuma* in *Tantra-śāstr*a,
*Mātṛkābheda-Tantra* says, 'Oh Lady of *Maheśa Svapuṣpa*, which charms
all is the *Ṛtu* which first appears in a married girl (V).

<span id="fn_129"></span>[83:5](htk21.htm#fr_129) *Svapuṣpairākīrṇam*.
The word *svapuṣpa* = *svayambhupuṣpa*—mentioned in the Tantras. The
word *puṣpa* has here, and in ordinary parlance, a figurative sense, as
in English. For *puspaśabdena atra ṛtur ucyate,
mātṛkābheda-tantra-pramāṇānusāreṇa anūḍhāyāh kanyāyāh prathama eva ṛtur
atra ucyate*. *Tantrāntare tu vivāhitāyā eva bālāyā ṛtur atra
vivakṣitah*. The *Śyāmārahasy*a reads '*supuṣpa*,' which literally means
pleasing fragrant flower, but which is possibly a misprint for
*svapushpa*. The meaning of the passage is as follows: *Sādhakah svasya
purobhāge śaktiṁ saṁsthāpya tasyā ṛturudhirasiktāṁ yoniṁ avalokayan san
devmantraṁ japati*.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[83:6](htk21.htm#fr_130) That is, *Kāma*, the
Deva of Desire, whose bow and arrows are made of flowers.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[83:7](htk21.htm#fr_131) *Japati*. Recites ten
thousand times (V).

<span id="fn_132"></span>[83:8](htk21.htm#fr_132) *Aho*. 'Ah' an
exclamation of wonder (V).

<span id="fn_133"></span>[83:9](htk21.htm#fr_133) Celestial spirits
(*devayoni*), who play and sing at the banquets of the Devas. According
to the Viṣṇu-Purāṇa, sons of Brahmā 'born imbibing melody.' The
*Sādhaka* thus becomes a master of dance, music and song, <span
id="page_85">p. 85</span> *Gandarva-śreṇīpatih*. He becomes a great
singer and a master of melody. The *Sāhasānka* says, '*Hāhā* is called a
*Gandharva* and singing also makes a *Gandharva*' (V).

<span id="fn_134"></span>[83:10](htk21.htm#fr_134) He becomes a
*Pandita* in all literature. The Kālī-Tantra, quoted in the
Kālīkalpalatā, says that in strength he becomes like the wind, in wealth
of gifts like Indra, and in the musical art like Tumburu (K.B.)—a *Ṛṣi*,
master of music and inventor of the *tāmbur*.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[83:11](htk21.htm#fr_135) Paramapadalinah
prabhavati, that is, he attains nirvāṇa (K.B.).

*Prabhavati*: becomes capable of creating and so forth on being merged
with Thy Supreme Feet (V). The word literally means 'Excels.'
