COMMENTARY

*'Kālī'*

Dispeller of the fear Kāla or Death.

*'Thou art Earth' (Dharitrī kīlālangshachirapi samīropi gaganam)*

Guptārṇava-Tantra says, 'Thou art Earth, Thou art Water, Thou art Fire,
Thou art the Air of the world, Thou art Ether, Thou art Mind as Manas,
Ahaṁkāra, Mahat (Buddhi) and Thou art Prakṛti. Thou art also, Oh Mother,
Ātmā. Thou art the Supreme. Nothing is greater than Thee. Oh Devī of
terrible form showing Thy teeth may my sins be forgiven me.' The
Triputā-Stotra also says, 'Thou art the Ādhāra-Śakti and the Ādhāra.
Thou dost pervade the world and the world is in Thee.'

*'One' (Ekā)*

Without a second.

*'Beneficent' (Kalyānī)*

Because She grants Nirvāṇa Liberation to Jīvas.

*'Spouse of Girisha' (Giriśaramanī)*

Spouse of Śiva. Or He who is in the Giri or Kūta is Giriśa that is
Kūtastha-Brahman; His spouse or Śakti. Though changeless (Nirvikārā)
Thou dost appear as the twenty-four Tattvas, namely,

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Earth and the rest
through Thy Māyā. The Devīsūkta of the Ṛg-Veda says, 'Thou who art one
and many, subtle and the Vikāras (gross things) and giveth birth to
millions of universes.'

*'All' (Sakalaṁ)*

Śruti says, 'Verily all this is Brahman '.

*'Helpless' (Agatikaṁ)*

On account of liability to rebirth despite Sādhana.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[76:1](htk18.htm#fr_109) <span id="page_77">p.
77</span> The Lord who inhabits the mountain, whereas, *Giriśa* is Lord
thereof.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[76:2](htk18.htm#fr_110) Liṅgapurāṇa says, Devī
becomes matter' (*Kṣetra*). She is *Kṣetrasvarūpā*, that is, the field
or matter which is known by the soul (*Kṣetrajña*). See Lalitā
Sahasranāma (fourth hundred) for the Brahman who creates the visible
world Itself enters into it (*Tat sṛṣtvā tād evānuprāviśat*.)

<span id="fn_111"></span>[76:3](htk18.htm#fr_111) *Kalyāṇi*. According
to the Padma-Purāṇa, Devī is worshipped as *Kalyāṇi* in the Malaya
Mountain.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[76:4](htk18.htm#fr_112) *Bhavaṁ anu na bhūyān
mama januh*, that is, liberated. The Śyāmārahasya reads *Bhavaṁ
ananubhūyāt*, using *bhavaṁ* as meaning *duhkhaṁ* (pain), arising from
*bhava* (the world) (K. B.).
