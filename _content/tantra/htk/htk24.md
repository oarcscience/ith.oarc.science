### VERSE 20

O MOTHER, he who, being a controller of his passions, <span
id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_151) eats *haviṣyānnaṁ*, <span
id="fr_152"></span>[2](#fn_152) and, being proficient in meditation on
Thy feet, rightly recites <span id="fr_153"></span>[3](#fn_153) Thy
*mantra* a hundred thousand times by day, and he who afterwards <span
id="fr_154"></span>[4](#fn_154) naked at night, when united with his
*Śakti*, <span id="fr_155"></span>[5](#fn_155) rightly recites Thy great
*mantra* another such hundred thousand times, becomes on earth like unto
the Destroyer of Smara. <span id="fr_156"></span>[6](#fn_156)

COMMENTARY

*'Naked' (Nagnah)*

That is free from the covering of Māyā; Nirvikāra.

*'Amorous play' (Nidhuvana-vinodena)*

That is enjoying the bliss of union between Ātmā and Paraśakti. The
Kulārṇava-Tantra says, 'That is coition (Maithuna) in which there is the
bliss arising from the union of Ātmā and Paraśakti. Others are but
Enjoyers of women.'

*'Becomes' (Syāt)*

That is, becomes liberated whilst yet living (Jīvanmukta) like Śiva.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_151"></span>[91:1](htk24.htm#fr_151) *Vashī*. The first
part of this *Śloka* refers to *Paśvācāra*.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[91:2](htk24.htm#fr_152) That is, one who has
undertaken the *Puraścaraṇavrata*, and eats the pure form of food known
as *Haviṣyānnaṁ* (K.B.).

*Haviṣyāśanaratah*: that is after the recitation (V).

<span id="fn_153"></span>[91:3](htk24.htm#fr_153) Makes *japa* (see
*ibid*.).

<span id="fn_154"></span>[91:4](htk24.htm#fr_154) *Paraṁ*: that is, when
he has been *Abhiṣikta* into *Vīrācāra*.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[91:5](htk24.htm#fr_155) <span id="page_92">p.
92</span> *Naktaṁ nagno nidhuvana-vinodena*, the meaning of which is
*yādā sādhakah śaktyā saha maithuna-kriyāsakto bhavati, tadā sa mantraṁ
japati*.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[91:6](htk24.htm#fr_156) *Smarahara* or *Śiva*
(see note [5](htk22.htm#fn_140) to *Śloka* 18, *ante*). The
Tantrakalpadruma says, 'He who eats *Haviṣyānnaṁ*, who keeping *Devī* in
mind recites the *Mantra* a hundred thousand times by day and is at
night united with his *Śakti* becomes the Lord of the earth.' (V).
