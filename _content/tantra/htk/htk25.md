*Hymn to Kali*, by Arthur Avalon (Sir John George Woodroffe), \[1922\],

### VERSE 21

O MOTHER, this Hymn of Thine is the source from whence originates Thy
*mantra*. <span id="fr_157"></span>[1](#fn_157) It sings of Thy real
self, and contains injunctions for the worship of Thy two lotus Feet. He
who reads it at midnight or at time of worship <span
id="fr_158"></span>[2](#fn_158) even his random talk <span
id="fr_159"></span>[3](#fn_159) becomes the nectar juice of poesy.

COMMENTARY

*'Thy real self' (Svarūpākhyaṁ)*

Speaks of the Dhyāna of both Thy gross and subtle aspects.

*'Reads' (Paṭati)*

That is recites aloud. The Viśuddheśvara-Tantra says, 'Oh Devī, the
reading of a Hymn (Stotra) mentally, or the recitation of a Mantra
loudly is as ineffectual as water in a broken jar.'

*'Nectar of Poesy' (Prasarati kavitvāmṛtarasah)*

He becomes full of the sweetness of Poesy. The Kālīkulasarvasva says,
All whose difficulties and dangers are destroyed by a single reading, as
it were flies in a flame. His speech flows like the Ganges full of prose
and poetry.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_157"></span>[93:1](htk25.htm#fr_157)
*Manusamuddharaṇajanuh*—that is, cause of *mantroddhāra*: formation of
Mantra of Devī. The *mantra* is made known, and then impressed with the
life and consciousness (*caitanya*) of the *sādhaka*
(*mantra-caitanya*).

<span id="fn_158"></span>[93:2](htk25.htm#fr_158) *Pūjā*.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[93:3](htk25.htm#fr_159) That is, even his
meaningless delirious talk, as in fever or madness, etc. (K.13.).
