### VERSE 16

O KĀLĪ, <span id="fr_119"></span>[1](#fn_119) whoever <span
id="fr_120"></span>[2](#fn_120) on Tuesday at midnight, <span
id="fr_121"></span>[3](#fn_121) having uttered Thy *mantra*, makes
offering even but once with devotion to Thee of a hair of his
*Śakti* <span id="fr_122"></span>[4](#fn_122) in the
cremation-ground, <span id="fr_123"></span>[5](#fn_123) becomes a great
poet, a Lord of the earth, and ever goes mounted upon an elephant. <span
id="fr_124"></span>[6](#fn_124)

COMMENTARY

*'Kālī'*

Dispeller of the fear of Kāla or Death.

*'Whoever'*

Here a Divya Sādhaka.

*'Midday' (Madhyāhne)*

At noon.

*'Devotion' (Premnā)*

That is Parabhakti.

*'Offers' (Vitarati)*

Merges in Thee, that is, attains Nirvikalpa-Samādhi. Pātanjala-Sūtra
says that Nirvikalpa-Samādhi is attained by suppression of the Vṛtti of
mind.

*'In the cremation-ground' (Citāyām)*

In thee as Consciousness (Cit).

*'Bīja'*

That is here nectar which issues on the enjoyment of the union of
Kula-kundalinī and Paramaśiva. The Gandharvamālikā-Tantra says, 'Oh
beloved One, the Queen of Devas unites with Paraśiva and

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

in a moment, Oh Devī Parameśvari, nectar is forthwith produced. That
nectar, Oh Devī, is like the juice of lac. With it, Oh, Mistress of the
Devas, libation (Tarpaṇa) should be offered to the supreme Devatā.'

'*At home' (Gṛhe)*

In the thousand petalled Lotus (Sahasrāra).

*'Hair with its root' (Cikuraṁ samūlaṁ)*

The mind with its functions. It is such Sādhaka who gains both enjoyment
and Liberation.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_119"></span>[80:1](htk20.htm#fr_119) <span id="page_81">p.
81</span> *Kālī* is destroyer of *Kāla* (V).

<span id="fn_120"></span>[80:2](htk20.htm#fr_120) 'Whoever' is here a
*Vīra Sādhaka*.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[80:3](htk20.htm#fr_121) *Madhyāhne*. Noon or
(here) midnight, *Kakārakūtarahasya* says, 'Whoever naked and with
dishevelled hair, on a Tuesday, at midnight, does *Homa* in the
cremation-ground with hair, nails, seed and whatever adheres to the
*Sammārjañī* and offers them after having uttered the *Mūlamantra* and
recited Thy name a thousand times attracts to him the Lord of the Earth'
(V).

<span id="fn_122"></span>[80:4](htk20.htm#fr_122) The offering is stated
in the words *grihe sammārjanyā parigalitabījam hi chikurang samūlang
madhyānhe vitarati chitayāng kujadine*. These words have received
various interpretations, of which the two chief alternatives are given.
*Gṛhe* is by some translated as 'at home,' in distinction from the
cremation-ground to which, according to this rendering, the *sādhaka*
subsequently goes to make his offering. This, however, is said to be
erroneous, as the *sādhanā* takes place not in the house but in the
cremation-ground. Others (see Calcutta edition) translate it as the
equivalent of *grihinī*, or wife. *Sammārjanī* is by them read to mean
'comb.' *Parigalita* is translated 'removed,' in the sense that the
curling of the hair of the wife is 'removed' or straightened with the
comb. *Bijam* given either its primary meaning, or as the equivalent of
*vīrya* is said to mean *kautilyam*, or curl of the hair. *Cikuram* is
hair,' and *samūlam* qualifies it, meaning pulled out, taken off at the
root. The meaning is, then, an offering is made of the wife's hair, the
curls (*kautilyam*) of which have been straightened out with the comb
(*sammārjanyā*), and some of which has come off at the root (*samūlam*).
The correct rendering, however, is according to K. B. *Śaktisādhakayoh
gṛhe maithunasamaye* <span id="page_82">p. 82</span>
*yoniliṁgasaṁgharṣavaśāt śaktiyonipatitaṁ vīryaliptaṁ loma devyai
samarpitaṁ bhavati*. *Gṛhe* thus does not mean 'at home,' but
*manmathagrihe*. The hair is from the same. *Saṁmārjanī* = *Śiśna*.
*Samūlaṁ* qualifies *cikuram* in the sense of 'come off at the root'
under the circumstances stated. *Parigalita* is 'dropped'—referring to
the *vīrya*.

According to *Vimalānanda*, *Gṛhe parigalita-vīryaṁ*, is that produced
by union with the *Sādhaka's* *svaśakti* or wife (V).

Of the words *Gṛhe saṁmārjanyā parigalita-viryaṁ cikuram samūlaṁ* the
Commentator Durgārāma Siddāntavāgiśa gives the two following alternative
expressions: (*a*) *Sammārjanyā* means with a comb with which the hair
is put in order. P*arigalitavīryam chikuram* means hair of which the
*Vīrya* or crookedness has been removed. *Gṛhe* means in the wife: for
it is said the wife is the home. The whole phrase then means Wife's
hair, root and all, combed out straight with a comb or (b) *Sammārjanyā
Parigalita-viryaṁ* means *Śukra* produced by *Sammārjanī* here meaning
*Liṅga* of the *Sādhaka*; *gṛhe* means in the abode of *Kāma* that is
*Yoni* of *Śakti* together with hair, root and all.

The English translation is somewhat abbreviated with the object of
giving only so much as all renderings are agreed upon. But in practice
*Vīrya* is used by most in its literal sense, this is the gross meaning.
The inner sense is given in the *Svarūpa-vyākhyā* which follows.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[80:5](htk20.htm#fr_123) According to some, the
offering is made on the built-up pyre, and, according to others, on the
fire after the body has been consumed. *Citā*, however, is really used
as a synonym for the burning ground (*Smaśāna*). The Niruttara-Tantra
(Ch. I) speaks of two Kinds of *Smaśāna*:

*Śmaśānaṁ dvividhaṁ deva citā yonih prakīṛtitaṁ*.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[80:6](htk20.htm#fr_124) That is, he becomes a
*Rājā*, and has no longer to go on foot like common folk.
