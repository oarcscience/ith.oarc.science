# NOTES.

# PREFACE.

<span id="xref_0_1">0\_1</span>. We are indebted for more than one
useful suggestion to our colleagues Messrs. Charles Michel and Joseph
Bidez, who were kind enough to read the proofs of the French edition.

<span id="xref_0_2">0\_2</span>. An outline of the present state of the
subject will be found in a recent volume by Gruppe, *Griechische
Mythologie*, 1906, pp. 1606 ff., whose views are sharply opposed to the
negative conclusions formulated, with certain reservations, by Harnack,
*Ausbreitung des Christentums,* II, pp. 274 ff. Among the latest studies
intended for the general reader that have appeared on this subject, may
be mentioned in Germany those of Geffcken (*Aus der Werdezeit des
Christentums, Leipsic*, 1904, pp. 114 ff .), and in England those of
Cheyne (*Bible Problems*, 1904), who expresses his opinion in these
terms: "The Christian religion is a synthesis, and only those who have
dim eyes can assert that the intellectual empires of Babylonia and
Persia have fallen."--Very useful is the new book of Clemen,
*Religionsgeschichtliche Erklärung des Neuen Testaments*, Giessen, 1909.

<span id="xref_0_3">0\_3</span>. *Mon. myst. Mithra*, I, p. 342, n. 4;
see the new texts commented on by Usener, *Rhein. Museum*, LX, 1905, pp.
466 ff.; 489 ff., and my paper "Natalis Invicti," *C. R. Acad. des
inscr.*, 1911.

<span id="xref_0_4">0\_4</span>. See page [70](orrp07.htm#page_70).
Compare also *Mon. myst. Mithra*, I, p. 341. The imitation of the church
is plain in the pagan reform attempted by the emperor Julian.

<span id="xref_0_5">0\_5</span>. See Harnack, *Militia Christi*, 1905.

<span id="xref_0_6">0\_6</span>. I have collected a number of texts on
the religious "militias" in *Mon. myst. Mithra*, I. p. 317, n. 1. Others
could certainly be discovered: Apuleius, *Metam.*, XL 14: *E cohorte
religionis* 

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

*unus* (in connection with a mystic of Isis);--Vettius Valens (V, 2, p.
220, 27, Kroll ed.): Στρατιῶται τῆς εἱμαρμένης; (VII. 3, p. 271, 28)
Συστρατεύεσθαι τοῖς καιροῖς γενναίως. See Minucius Felix, 36, § 7: *Quod
patimur non est poena, militia est*.--We might also mention the
commonplace term *militia Veneris*, which was popular with the Augustan
poets (Propertius, IV, 1, 137; see I, 6, 30; Horace, *Od*., III, 26, and
especially the parallel developed by Ovid, *Amor*., I, 9, 1 ff., and
*Ars amat.*, III, 233 ff).--Socrates, in Plato's Apologia (p. 28 E),
incidentally likens the philosophic mission imposed on him by the
divinity to the campaigns he waged under the orders of the archons, but
the comparison of God with a "strategus" was developed especially by the
Stoics; see Capelle, "Schrift von der Welt," *Neue Jahrb. für das klass.
Altert.*, XV, 1905, p. 558, n. 6, and Seneca, *Epist*., 107, 9: *Optimum
est Deum sine murmuratione comitari, malus miles est qui imperatorem
gemens sequitur*.--See now also Reitzenstein, *Hellenistische
Mysterienreligion*, 1910, p. 66.

<span id="xref_0_7">0\_7</span>. See *Rev. des études grecques*, XIV,
1901, pp. 43 ff.

<span id="xref_0_8">0\_8</span>. This has been clearly shown by Wendland
in connection with the idea of the σωτηρία, *Zeitschrift für neutest.
Wiss.*, V, 1904, pp. 355 ff. More recently he has thrown light on the
general influence of Hellenistic civilization on Christianity (*Die
hellenistisch-römische Kultur in ihren Besiehungen zum Judentum und
Christentum*, Tübingen, 1908). A first attempt to determine the
character of Hellenistic mysteries is to be found in Reitzenstein's
*Hellenistische Mysterienreligion*, 1910.
