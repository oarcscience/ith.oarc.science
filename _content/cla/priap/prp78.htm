<P>Quod sum iam senior meumque canis<BR>
Cum barba caput albicet capillis:<BR>
Deprensos ego perforare possum<BR>
Tithonum Priamumque Nestoremque.<BR>
Immanem stomachum mihi movetis,<BR>
qui densam facitis subinde saepem<BR>
et fures prohibetis huc adire.<BR>
hoc est laedere, dum iuvatis; hoc est<BR>
non admittere ad aucupem volucres.<BR>
obstructa est via, nec licet iacenti<BR>
iactura natis expiare culpam.<BR>
ergo qui prius usque et usque et usque<BR>
furum scindere podices solebam,<BR>
per noctes aliquot diesque cesso.<BR>
poenas do quoque, quot satis superque est,<BR>
in semenque abeo salaxque quondam<BR>
nunc vitam perago - quis hoc putaret? -<BR>
ut clusus citharoedus abstinentem.<BR>
at vos, ne peream situ senili,<BR>
quaeso, desinite esse diligentes<BR>
neve imponite fibulam Priapo.</P>
<P>Though I be ag&egrave;d now, though head and chin<BR>
Now show them hoary-hue'd with grizzling hair,<BR>
Still can I perforate those caught by me,<BR>
Tithonus, Priam, Nestor--every one.<BR>
You see how mightily my rage ye rouse<BR>
Who hem me ever with a bullfinch hedge<BR>
Forbidding robbers from approaching me.<BR>
This is to hurt while helping, this is but<BR>
To scare the birdies from the birder's snare.<BR>
The way is clos&egrave;d nor prone-fallen thief<BR>
Can with his backside expiate his crime.<BR>
Thus I who erstwhile ever, ever and aye<BR>
Buttocks of plundering wights was wont to cleave,<BR>
For many a night and day in idlesse stand.<BR>
I also, suffering pains enough and more,<BR>
Flow off in semen and a lecher whiles<BR>
Unlive my life-tide. Who could ever think<BR>
From lute the lutanist should cut him clear?<BR>
But you, ereeld's marasmus do me dead,<BR>
Desist, I pray you from vain diligence,<BR>
Nor hang a buckle on Priapus' yard.</P>
<P>Although I am now growing old, and my beard and locks whiten with hoary hairs, I am still able to perforate [sodomise] a Tithonus, a Priam, and a Nestor, when caught. Ye see that ye stir up my bile, who continually raise a thick fence, and thus prevent thieves from approaching hither. This is hindering, whilst ye help me; this is not to admit birds to the fowler's snare. The way is blocked up, nor can the prostrate one expiate his crime at the expense of his buttocks. So that I who erstwhile was wont ever and ever and ever to cleave the buttocks of pilferers have had naught of employment this many a day and night. I also suffer punishment enough and more than enough; I flow off in seed, and once lecherous, no longer carry out my life's aim. Who would think of the lutist abstaining from his melody? But, lest I perish from senile decay, pray ye desist from such diligence, nor place a <I>fibula</I> on Priapus.</P>
