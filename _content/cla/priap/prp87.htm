<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">by Caius Valerius Catullus</H3>
<P>Ego haec, ego arte fabricata rustica,<BR>
ego arida, o viator, ecce populus<BR>
agellulum hunc, sinistra et ante quem vides,<BR>
erique villulam hortulumque pauperis<BR>
tuor malaque furis arceo manu.<BR>
Mihi corolla picta vere ponitur,<BR>
mihi rubens arista sole fervido,<BR>
mihi virente dulcis uva pampino,<BR>
mihi caduca oliva, cocta frigore.<BR>
Meis capella delicata pascuis<BR>
in urbem adulta lacte portat unbera,<BR>
meisque pinguis agnus ex ovilibus<BR>
gravem domum remittit aere dexteram,<BR>
teneraque matre mugiente vaccula<BR>
deum profundit ante templa sanguinem.<BR>
Proin, viator, hunc deum vereberis<BR>
manumque sursum habebis. Hoc tibi expedit,<BR>
parata namque crux stat ecce mentula.<BR>
"Velim pol" inquis? At pol ecce vilicus<BR>
venit, valente cui revulsa bracchio<BR>
fit ista mentula apta clava dexterae.</P>
<P>I thuswise fashioned I by rustic art<BR>
And from dried poplar-trunk (O traveller!) hewn,<BR>
This fieldlet, leftwards as thy glances fall,<BR>
And my lord's cottage with his pauper garth<BR>
Protect, repelling thieves' rapacious hands.<BR>
In spring with vari-coloured wreaths I'm crown'd,<BR>
In fervid summer with the glowing grain,<BR>
Then with green vine-shoot and the luscious bunch,<BR>
And glaucous olive-tree in bitter cold.<BR>
The dainty she-goat from my pasture bears<BR>
Her milk-distended udders to the town:<BR>
Out of my sheep-cotes ta'en the fatted lamb<BR>
Sends home with silver right-hand heavily charged;<BR>
And, while its mother lows, the tender calf<BR>
Before the temples of the Gods must bleed.<BR>
Hence of such Godhead (traveller!), stand in awe;<BR>
Best it befits thee off to keep thy hands.<BR>
Thy cross is ready, shaped as artless yard;<BR>
'I'm willing 'faith' (thou say'st) but 'faith here comes<BR>
The boor and plucking forth with bended arm<BR>
Makes of this tool a club for doughty hand.</P>
<P>I, O traveller, shaped with rustic art from a dry poplar, guard this little field which thou seest on the left, and the cottage and small garden of its indigent owner, and keep off the greedy hands of the robber. In spring a many-tinted wreath is placed upon me; in summer's heat ruddy grain; [in autumn] a luscious grape cluster with vineshoots, and in the bitter cold the pale-green olive. The tender she-goat bears from my pasture to the town milk-distended udders; the well-fattened lamb from my sheepfolds sends back [its owner] with a heavy handful of money; and the tender calf, 'midst its mother's lowings, sheds its blood before the temple of the gods. Hence, warfarer, thou shalt be in awe of this god, and it will be profitable to thee to keep thy hands off. For a punishment is prepared--a roughly-shaped mentule. 'Truly, I am willing,' thou sayest; then, truly, behold the farmer comes, and that same mentule plucked from my groin will become. an apt cudgel in his strong right hand.[1]</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The traveller mocks at Priapus's threat of sodomy as a punishment. The god, in anger, retorts that if that punishment has no fears for him, a fustigation by the Farmer with the self-same mentule used as a cudgel may have a more deterrent effect.]</P>
