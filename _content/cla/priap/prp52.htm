<P>Heus tu, non bene qui manum rapacem<BR>
mandato mihi contines ab horto,<BR>
iam primum stator hic libidinosus<BR>
alternis et eundo et exeundo<BR>
porta te faciet patentiorem.<BR>
accedent duo, qui latus tuentur,<BR>
pulchre pensilibus peculiati;<BR>
qui cum te male foderint iacentem,<BR>
ad partes veniet salax asellus<BR>
nilo deterius mutuniatus.<BR>
quare qui sapiet, malum cavebit,<BR>
cum tantum sciet esse mentularum.</P>
<P>Ho thou, which hardly thy rapacious hand<BR>
Canst from the garden in my charge contain,<BR>
First shall this watchman, ever lustful loon,<BR>
Entering and exiting alternate-wise<BR>
Widen thy portal to its fullest stretch<BR>
Then shall the couple guarding either flank,<BR>
Grandly provided with those pensile parts,<BR>
After they've sorely pierced thee prostrate thrown<BR>
Bring to the self-same part an ass-foal lewd<BR>
Gifted with pizzle not a whit the worse.<BR>
Then who is wise beware of working ill,<BR>
Knowing so much of pego waits him here.</P>
<P>Hark ye, thou who scarcely withholdest thy greedy hand from the garden entrusted to me. Now, first the watchman, full of lechery, with alternate entrance and exit, shall make thy passage an open one. Then two shall approach, who stand guard at each side, nobly provided with pensile property. Who, when they have grievously ploughed thee, stretched prostrate, to the same part shall come a rampant little ass, by no means inferior in well-hung pizzle. Wherefore, he who is wise will beware of ill-doing, when he knows that here is so much of the mentule.</P>
