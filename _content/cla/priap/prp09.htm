<P>Insulsissima quid puella rides?<BR>
non me Praxiteles Scopasve fecit,<BR>
nec sum Phidiaca manu politus;<BR>
sed lignum rude vilicus dolavit,<BR>
et dixit mihi: 'tu Priapus esto'.<BR>
spectas me tamen et subinde rides?<BR>
nimirum tibi salsa res videtur<BR>
adstans inguinibus columna nostris.</P>
<P>Why laugh such laughter, O most silly maid?<BR>
My form Praxiteles nor Scopas hewed;<BR>
To me no Phidian handwork finish gave;<BR>
But me a bailiff hacked from shapeless log,<BR>
And quoth my maker, 'Thou Priapus be!'<BR>
Yet on me gazing forthright gigglest thou<BR>
And holdest funny matter to deride<BR>
The pillar perking from the groin of me.</P>
<P>Why, most foolish girl, do you laugh? Neither Praxiteles[1] nor Scopas[2] has given me shape, nor have I been perfected by the hand of Phidias;[3] but a bailiff carved me from a shapeless log, and said to me, 'You are Priapus!'[4] Yet you gaze at me, and laugh repeatedly. Doubtless it seems to you a droll thing--the 'column' standing upright from my groin.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Praxiteles, according to Pliny, lived in the time of Pompeius: his statue of Venus was very famous.</P>
<P>2. Scopas was a celebrated sculptor in marble and carved in relief on the Mausoleum.</P>
<P>3. Phidias was a renowned ivory sculptor.</P>
<P>4. The statue was so badly carved that the sculptor had to explain what his work was intended to represent.]</P>
