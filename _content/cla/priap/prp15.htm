<P>Qualibus Hippomenes rapuit Schoeneida pomis,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; qualibus Hesperidum nobilis hortus erat,<BR>
qualia credibile est spatiantem rure paterno<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nausicaam pleno saepe tulisse sinu,<BR>
quale fuit malum quod littera pinxit Aconti,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; qua lecta cupido pacta puella viro est:<BR>
taliacumque pius dominus florentis agelli<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; imposuit mensae, nude Priape, tuae.</P>
<P>Rare as those apples wherewith Hippomenes Schoene&iuml;s ravished;<BR>
Fair as the fruits that enfam'd Garths of the Hesperid maids;<BR>
Fen as one fancies the lot which, pacing her patrial vergers,<BR>
Nausica&auml; full oft bare in her well-fill&egrave;d lap;<BR>
Sweet as the pome whereon Acontius limn&egrave;d the letters<BR>
Which being read his Fair pledged to her love-longing swain;<BR>
Such be the fruits that youth who owneth the flourishing fieldlet<BR>
Placed on the table of stone, naked Priapus! for thee.</P>
<P>As the apples with which Hippomenes raped the daughter of Schoeneus;[1] for which the garden of the Hesperides was renowned; which one may imagine Nausicaa[2] often carrying in her teeming lap as she walked in her father's domains; as was that apple graced by the words of Acontius, which, read aloud [by Cydippe], pledged the maiden to this ardent lover[3]--such are those which the boy-owner of a small but fertile field has placed on thy sacrificial table, O naked Priapus.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Referring to the story of the race between Hippomenes and Atalanta, and how the crafty lover tricked the damsel into defeat by the three gold apples.</P>
<P>2. Nausicaa was the daughter of Alcinous, king of Phaeacia, whose pleasure demensnes and luxuriousness became a proverb.</P>
<P>3. The story is very prettily told by Aristaenetus. The words on the apple were--'I swear to thee inviolably, by the mystic rites of Diana, that I will join myself to thee as thy companion and will become thy bride.' According to Vossius the gift of an apple was equivalent to a promise of the last favour. The Emperor Theodosius caused Paulinus to be murdered for receiving an apple from his empress.]</P>
