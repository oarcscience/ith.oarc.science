### Priapus

### by Caius Valerius Catullus

Ego haec, ego arte fabricata rustica,  
ego arida, o viator, ecce populus  
agellulum hunc, sinistra et ante quem vides,  
erique villulam hortulumque pauperis  
tuor malaque furis arceo manu.  
Mihi corolla picta vere ponitur,  
mihi rubens arista sole fervido,  
mihi virente dulcis uva pampino,  
mihi caduca oliva, cocta frigore.  
Meis capella delicata pascuis  
in urbem adulta lacte portat unbera,  
meisque pinguis agnus ex ovilibus  
gravem domum remittit aere dexteram,  
teneraque matre mugiente vaccula  
deum profundit ante templa sanguinem.  
Proin, viator, hunc deum vereberis  
manumque sursum habebis. Hoc tibi expedit,  
parata namque crux stat ecce mentula.  
"Velim pol" inquis? At pol ecce vilicus  
venit, valente cui revulsa bracchio  
fit ista mentula apta clava dexterae.

I thuswise fashioned I by rustic art  
And from dried poplar-trunk (O traveller!) hewn,  
This fieldlet, leftwards as thy glances fall,  
And my lord's cottage with his pauper garth  
Protect, repelling thieves' rapacious hands.  
In spring with vari-coloured wreaths I'm crown'd,  
In fervid summer with the glowing grain,  
Then with green vine-shoot and the luscious bunch,  
And glaucous olive-tree in bitter cold.  
The dainty she-goat from my pasture bears  
Her milk-distended udders to the town:  
Out of my sheep-cotes ta'en the fatted lamb  
Sends home with silver right-hand heavily charged;  
And, while its mother lows, the tender calf  
Before the temples of the Gods must bleed.  
Hence of such Godhead (traveller!), stand in awe;  
Best it befits thee off to keep thy hands.  
Thy cross is ready, shaped as artless yard;  
'I'm willing 'faith' (thou say'st) but 'faith here comes  
The boor and plucking forth with bended arm  
Makes of this tool a club for doughty hand.

I, O traveller, shaped with rustic art from a dry poplar, guard this
little field which thou seest on the left, and the cottage and small
garden of its indigent owner, and keep off the greedy hands of the
robber. In spring a many-tinted wreath is placed upon me; in summer's
heat ruddy grain; \[in autumn\] a luscious grape cluster with
vineshoots, and in the bitter cold the pale-green olive. The tender
she-goat bears from my pasture to the town milk-distended udders; the
well-fattened lamb from my sheepfolds sends back \[its owner\] with a
heavy handful of money; and the tender calf, 'midst its mother's
lowings, sheds its blood before the temple of the gods. Hence, warfarer,
thou shalt be in awe of this god, and it will be profitable to thee to
keep thy hands off. For a punishment is prepared--a roughly-shaped
mentule. 'Truly, I am willing,' thou sayest; then, truly, behold the
farmer comes, and that same mentule plucked from my groin will become.
an apt cudgel in his strong right hand.\[1\]

\[1. The traveller mocks at Priapus's threat of sodomy as a punishment.
The god, in anger, retorts that if that punishment has no fears for him,
a fustigation by the Farmer with the self-same mentule used as a cudgel
may have a more deterrent effect.\]
