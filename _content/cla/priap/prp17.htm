<P>Commoditas haec est in nostro maxima pene,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; laxa quod esse mihi femina nulla potest.</P>
<P>Aye in this prickle of ours the bonniest boon to be found is,<BR>
Loose for my daily use never a woman can be.</P>
<P>The greatest advantage in my penis is this, that no woman can be [too] roomy[1] for me.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. A popular theme of the poets. From Scioppius, 'However loose her coynte may be I will zealously fill it.' And from Martial against Lydia--</P>
<P>'Me roomy Lydia's private parts surpass<BR>
The lusty dray horse' elephantine arse;<BR>
Wide as the schoolboy's ringing iron hoop;<BR>
Vast as the ring the agile riders stoop<BR>
And leap through neatly, touching not the side,<BR>
As round and round the dusty course they ride;<BR>
Capacious as some old and well-worn shoe,<BR>
That's trudged the muddy streets since first 'twas new;<BR>
Stretched like the net the crafty fowler holds;<BR>
And drapery as a curtain's heavy folds;<BR>
Loose as the bracelet gemmed with green and scarlet,<BR>
That mocks the arm of some consumptive harlot;<BR>
Slack as a feather bed without the feathers;<BR>
And baggy as some ostler's well-used leathers;<BR>
Relaxed and hanging like the skinny coat<BR>
That shields the vulture's foul and flabby throat.<BR>
'Tis said, while bathing once we trod love's path,<BR>
I know not, but I seemed to fuck the bath.</P>
<P>A somewhat similar person was the provident wife in the poem of "The Sutler', who when her husband was robbed of his horses and waggon and all his goods by a party of the enemy's forces, consoled him as follows--</P>
<P>'No matter,' she said, and look'd with a smile,<BR>
'I did the damn'd party, in some sort, beguile;'<BR>
Then drew out a purse twice as big as your fist,<BR>
'Tho' they search'd me,' said she, 'this treasure they missed;<BR>
Then prithee, be cheerful.' This gave him new life,<BR>
He wept, and he laugh'd, and he ogl'd his wife,<BR>
And leering upon her, said, 'Tell me, my dear,<BR>
Where was it you hid the purse I see here?'<BR>
She smil'd on her spouse, then laugh'd in his face,<BR>
'I hid it,' said she, 'in a certain place,<BR>
With which you're acquainted! He said, 'My dear life,<BR>
I see you're a careful and provident wife;<BR>
You've done very well, but you'd had more to brag on,<BR>
If you there had conceal'd the horses and waggon.']</P>
