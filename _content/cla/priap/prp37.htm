<P>Cur pictum memori sit in tabella<BR>
membrum, quaeritis, unde procreamur?<BR>
cum penis mihi forte laesus esset<BR>
chirurgamque manum miser timerem,<BR>
dis me legitimis nimisque magnis,<BR>
ut Phoebo puta filioque Phoebi,<BR>
curatum dare mentulam verebar.<BR>
huic dixi: 'fer opem, Priape, parti,<BR>
cuius tu, pater, ipse pars videris,<BR>
qua salva sine sectione facta<BR>
ponetur tibi picta, quam levaris,<BR>
compar consimilisque concolorque'.<BR>
promisit fore mentulamque movit<BR>
pro nutu deus et rogata fecit.</P>
<P>Why on memorial tablet do they limn<BR>
(You ask) the member which begets us all?<BR>
Whenas by accident my yard was hurt<BR>
And I (unhappy!) feared the surgeon's hand<BR>
To such legitimate almighty gods--<BR>
Phoebus for instance take or Phoebus' son--<BR>
I blushed to offer for a cure my cock<BR>
And prayed--'Priapus, an thou heal the part,<BR>
O Sire, whose very counterpart thou seem'st<BR>
And without hacking make it whole again,<BR>
One linmed on tablet shall to thee be given<BR>
Like-sized, like-coloured and alike of shape.'<BR>
The God to promise deigning wagged his yard,<BR>
By way of nod divine, and did my bede.</P>
<P>You ask why the instrument of procreation has been painted on the memorable tablet. When by accident I had bruised my penis, and wretched with suffering, dreaded the hand of the surgeon (moreover I was afraid to give the cure of my mentule to the legitimate and almighty gods, such as Phoebus, for instance, and Phoebus's son),[2] 'Help, O Priapus,' quoth I, 'help thou the part whose very counterpart, O Sire, thou seemest; and if thou shalt restore it safely to health without amputation,[3] I will consecrate to thee, painted on a tablet, a very facsimile of it, alike in size, shape and colour! 'The God promised; for nod bobbed his mentule;[4] and has granted my prayer.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Pacificus Maximus addresses a similar entreaty to Priapus, when suffering from the pox, offering, if cured, to dedicate to the god a waxen column equal in size to that of the sufferer. Cures were sought to such <I>morbi venerii</I> as <I>inflamatio coleomm</I> (swollen testicles), <I>tubercula circa glandem</I> (warts on the glans penis), <I>cancri carbunculi</I> (chancre or shanker) and a few others.</P>
<P>2. Phoebus was the god of the healing art. Aesculapius was his son.</P>
<P>3. Reminding one of Don Juan's healthy horror when they proposed to circumcise him.</P>
<P>4. Parodying the majestic nod of Jupiter when grating a request.]</P>
