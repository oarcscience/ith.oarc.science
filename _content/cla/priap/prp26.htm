<P>Deliciae populi, magno notissima circo<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Quintia, vibratas docta movere nates,<BR>
cymbala cum crotalis, pruriginis arma, Priapo<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ponit et adducta tympana pulsa manu.<BR>
pro quibus, ut semper placeat spectantibus, orat,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; tentaque ad exemplum sit sua turba dei.</P>
<P>Well-known darling of folk in the Circus Maximus far famed,<BR>
Quinctia, tremulous hips train&egrave;d and artful to wag,<BR>
Cymbals and castanets (the wanton arms) to Priapus<BR>
Offers and tambourine struck with the hand to self drawn.<BR>
Wherefore prays she that aye she please her mob of admirers;<BR>
Let one and all stand stiff after the wont of her god.</P>
<P>Quinctia, the people's darling, renowned in the Great Circus, cunning to flirt her tremulous buttocks to and fro, the cymbals and the castanet, the weapons of wantonness,[1] dedicates to Priapus, and the tambour, struck by the hand towards her drawn. And she prays for them, that she may always find favour with her spectators; and that her crowd of admirers may be 'rigid'[2], after the manner of the god.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. So called because the songs and dances to which the cymbals and castanets were accompaniments were of a loose and wanton character, inciting the spectators to venery.</P>
<P>2. This was looked on as a mark of the dancer's success in arousing the spectators' passions by her lascivious movements and postures.]</P>
