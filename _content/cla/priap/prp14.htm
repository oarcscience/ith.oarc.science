<P>Commisso mihi non satis modestas<BR>
quicumque attulerit manus agello,<BR>
is me sentiet esse non spadonem.<BR>
dicat forsitan haec sibi ipse: 'nemo<BR>
hic inter frutices loco remoto<BR>
percisum sciet esse me', sed errat:<BR>
magnis testibus ista res agetur.</P>
<P>Charged to my charge the fieldlet who shall dare<BR>
With hand not modest anywise molest,<BR>
Me fox no eunuch he shall know and feet.<BR>
Here in a distant place the hurst amid<BR>
He peradventure to himself shall say--<BR>
'None! saw me so misused.' But he is wrong:<BR>
These huge attestors shall the cause maintain.</P>
<P>He who shall plunder with dishonest hand the little field committed to my charge, shall feel me to be no eunuch[1] in this lonely place among the bushes. Here, perhaps, he will say this to himself, 'None will know that I have been thrust through.'[2] He will be mistaken; that cause will be sustained by 'weighty' witnesses![3]</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Martial and Juvenal have many references to eunuchism and the use to which the Roman ladies put these castratos, who were of various kinds: <I>castrati</I> (<I>castare</I>, meaning to cut oft)--those who had lost both penis and testicles; <I>spadones</I> (either <I>spata</I>, a Gallic word meaning a razor, or Spada, a Persian village where the operation of eunuchism is performed)--those who still retained the penis; <I>thlibiae</I> (from the Greek meaning to rub with hemlock, etc.)--those whose testicles had been extracted by compression; <I>thliasiae</I> (from the Greek meaning to crush); <I>cremaster</I> (so called from the destruction of the muscle, <I>cremaster</I>, by which the testicle is suspended or drawn up or compressed in the act of coition); and <I>bagoas</I>. The subject scarcely calls for extended notice in this work, but I would refer those interested in the subject to <I>The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night</I>, translated by Sir Richard F. Burton.</P>
<P>2. <I>Praecidere</I> (literally meaning to cut off). Here means to cut through the bowels. It has a similar meaning in Juvenal--'to run against yesterday's supper'. Like expressions are <I>billas dividere</I>, 'to divide the bowels', and <I>cacare mentulam</I>, 'to defile the mentule with ordure'.</P>
<P>3. In the original, <I>magnis testibus</I>, meaning trustworthy witness; and, by a play upon words, large testicles.]</P>
