### Priapus

Forma Mercurius potest placere,  
forma conspiciendus est Apollo,  
formosus quoque pingitur Lyaeus,  
formosissimus omnium est Cupido.  
me pulchra fateor carere forma,  
verum mentula luculenta nostra est:  
hanc mavult sibi quam deos priores,  
si qua est non fatui puella cunni.

Form-charms in Mercury have might to please;  
Form in Apollo is conspicuous charm;  
Formose in picture is Lyaeus limned  
And Cupid most formose of all is shown.  
Freely of lovely form the lack I own;  
Yet is our mentule a resplendent gem;  
And this to th'erst-named gods shall aye prefer  
The damsel dowered with no fatuous coynte.

Mercury has a pleasing form, Apollo's is eminent for its beauty; Lyaeus
too is painted of comely figure; Cupid is handsomest of all. My figure
is, I confess, wanting in beauty, but my mentule is, in truth,
magnificent; and if there be a girl with a sensible coynte, she had
rather have that for herself than all the former gods.
