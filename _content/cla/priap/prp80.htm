<P>Priape, quod sis fascino gravis tento,<BR>
quod exprobravit hanc tibi suo versu<BR>
poeta noster, erubescere hoc noli:<BR>
non es poeta sarcinosior nostro.</P>
<P>Although with yard distent (Priapus!) weighted<BR>
(Wherewith our poet did reprove thee here<BR>
In verse), on no wise deign thereat to blush;<BR>
Thou be not heavier than our poet hung.</P>
<P>Priapus, though thou mayst be weighty with turgid <I>fascinum</I>, albeit our poet in his verses has cast this in thy teeth, blush not for it. Thou art not more heavily hung than is that poet of ours.</P>
