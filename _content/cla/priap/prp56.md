### Priapus

Derides quoque, fur, et impudicum  
ostendis digitum mihi minanti?  
eheu me miserum, quod ista lignum est,  
quae me terribilem facit videri.  
mandabo domino tamen salaci,  
ut pro me velit irrumare fures.

Thou too dost mock me, Thief! and the infamous  
Finger dost point when menacèd by me!  
Ah hapless I, that should be only wood  
What makes me ever formidable seem!  
Yet will I charge my garden's lustful lord  
For me deign robber-folk to irrumate.

Thou also mockest, O thief, and when threatened, dost stretch out to me
the indecent finger!\[1\] Alas, unhappy I! that the thing is but wood
which makes me seem fearsome. But no matter, I will charge the lecherous
owner of the garden that he may be willing to irrumate the thieves for
me.

\[1. The middle finger. It was called 'infamous', according to some
writers, on account of the custom of the Jews, who used to wipe the
podex when they suffered from bleeding piles. This is not so. It derived
its name from its resemblance to the mentule, and it is used in that
sense here. When the middle finger is pointing, the other fingers are
turned inside, representing a mentule with its accessories; for which
reason it was thus pointedly shown in derision to sodomites. Martial:
'Cestus with tears in his eyes often complains to me, Mamurianus, of
being teased with your finger.' In an admirable article on pederasty in
*The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night*: 'Debauchees had signals
like Freemasons whereby they recognised one another. The Greek
*skematízein* was made by closing the hand to represent the scrotum and
raising the middle finger as if to feel whether a hen had eggs; hence
the Athenians called it *catapygon* or sodomite and the Romans *digitus*
*impudicus* or *infamis*, the 'medical finger' of Rabelais and the
Chiromantists--though properly speaking *medicus* is the third or
ring-finger, as shown by the old Chiromantist verses. The modern Italian
does the same by inserting the thumb-tip between the index and medius to
suggest the clitoris. When the Egyptians wish to represent pederasty,
they painted two partridges, who, when bereft of their mates, were
supposed to enjoy each other. Pliny supports this statement.

The finger was also pointed at people as a mark of simple contempt.
Martial: 'He points with the finger, but with the infamous finger.'
Persius says, without any obscene afterthought, 'The grandmother
cleanses with infamous finger the infant.'\]
