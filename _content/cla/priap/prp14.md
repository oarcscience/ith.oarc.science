### Priapus

Commisso mihi non satis modestas  
quicumque attulerit manus agello,  
is me sentiet esse non spadonem.  
dicat forsitan haec sibi ipse: 'nemo  
hic inter frutices loco remoto  
percisum sciet esse me', sed errat:  
magnis testibus ista res agetur.

Charged to my charge the fieldlet who shall dare  
With hand not modest anywise molest,  
Me fox no eunuch he shall know and feet.  
Here in a distant place the hurst amid  
He peradventure to himself shall say--  
'None! saw me so misused.' But he is wrong:  
These huge attestors shall the cause maintain.

He who shall plunder with dishonest hand the little field committed to
my charge, shall feel me to be no eunuch\[1\] in this lonely place among
the bushes. Here, perhaps, he will say this to himself, 'None will know
that I have been thrust through.'\[2\] He will be mistaken; that cause
will be sustained by 'weighty' witnesses!\[3\]

\[1. Martial and Juvenal have many references to eunuchism and the use
to which the Roman ladies put these castratos, who were of various
kinds: *castrati* (*castare*, meaning to cut oft)--those who had lost
both penis and testicles; *spadones* (either *spata*, a Gallic word
meaning a razor, or Spada, a Persian village where the operation of
eunuchism is performed)--those who still retained the penis; *thlibiae*
(from the Greek meaning to rub with hemlock, etc.)--those whose
testicles had been extracted by compression; *thliasiae* (from the Greek
meaning to crush); *cremaster* (so called from the destruction of the
muscle, *cremaster*, by which the testicle is suspended or drawn up or
compressed in the act of coition); and *bagoas*. The subject scarcely
calls for extended notice in this work, but I would refer those
interested in the subject to *The Book of the Thousand Nights and a
Night*, translated by Sir Richard F. Burton.

2\. *Praecidere* (literally meaning to cut off). Here means to cut
through the bowels. It has a similar meaning in Juvenal--'to run against
yesterday's supper'. Like expressions are *billas dividere*, 'to divide
the bowels', and *cacare mentulam*, 'to defile the mentule with ordure'.

3\. In the original, *magnis testibus*, meaning trustworthy witness;
and, by a play upon words, large testicles.\]
