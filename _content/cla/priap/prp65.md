# 65

### To Priapus

Hic tibi, qui rostro crescentia lilia mersit,  
   caeditur e tepida victima porcus hara:  
ne tamen exanimum facias pecus omne, Priape,  
   horti sit, facias, ianua clausa tui.

This, with his snout aye alert to uproot the lilies a-blowing,  
Slain for thy victim 's the pig bred in the stye's tepid reek.  
But, an thy will be not to murther the herd, O Priapus,  
Grant of thy grace yon gate into the garden be shut.

This pig, which has crushed the rising lilies with his snout, is
sacrificed to thee--a victim warm from the stye. But lest thou shouldst
cause the whole herd to be annihilated, O Priapus, bid the gate of thy
garden to be closed.\[2\]

\[1. The effeminate come, allured by the pleasure of being sodomised.

2\. The priestesses of Priapus were sometimes represented in marble
sculptures as clothed with hides of swine.\]
