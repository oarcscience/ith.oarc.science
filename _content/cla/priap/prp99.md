\[1. One which utters a clucking sound (*poppysma*) during coition by

When th' hast a face of which no woman may  
And body without blur, have ought to say,  
Why suitors thee so seldom do repeat  
And seek dost wonder, Galla? the fault's great,  
As oft as thou and I in the work join'd,  
Thy lips; were silent, but thou prat'st behind.  
Heavens grant that thou wouldst speak, but bridle that,  
I'm angry with thy tatling twit come twat.  
I'd rather hear thee fart, for Symmachus  
Says that's a means of laughter unto us.  
But who can smile to hear the foolish smack  
Of thy loose toul? and when it gives a crack  
Whose mind and mettle will not fall? at least  
Speak something that may usher in a jest  
Of thy Coynte's noise; but if thou art so mute,  
Articulately learn thence to dispute.--Fletcher's *Martial*\]
