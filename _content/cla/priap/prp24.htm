<P>Hoc sceptrum, quod ab arbore est recisum,<BR>
nulla iam poterit virere fronde,<BR>
sceptrum, quod pathicae petunt puellae,<BR>
quod quidam cupiunt tenere reges,<BR>
cui dant oscula nobiles cinaedi,<BR>
intra viscera furis ibit usque<BR>
ad pubem capulumque coleorum.</P>
<P>This staff of office cut from tree as 'tis,<BR>
No more with leafage green for aye to bloom;<BR>
Staff by the pathic damsels fondly loved,<BR>
Which e'en the kings delight in hand to hold<BR>
And oft by noble catamites bekissed--<BR>
This staff in robbers' vitals deep shall plunge<BR>
Up to its bushy base and bag of balls.</P>
<P>This staff of office, which, severed from the tree, can now shoot forth no verdure; sceptre, which pathic maidens crave, and some kings love to hold; to which patrician[1] paederasts give kisses; shall go right into the very bowels of the thief, as far as the hair and the bag of balls.[2]</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. 'Patrician' and 'notorious' are alternative renderings of 'the Latin word <I>oscula</I>.</P>
<P>2. The whole of Priapus's member to the very hair of the pudendum and the scrotum would be thrust into the thief.]</P>
