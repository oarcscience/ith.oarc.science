<P>Parum est quod hic ut fiximus semel sedem,<BR>
agente terra per caniculam rimas<BR>
siticulosam sustinemus aestatem?<BR>
parum, quod hiemis perfluunt sinus imbres<BR>
et in capillos grandines cadunt nostros<BR>
rigetque dura barba vincta crystallo?<BR>
parum, quod acta sub laboribus luce<BR>
parem diebus pervigil traho noctem?<BR>
huc adde, quod me fuste de rudi vilem<BR>
manus sine arte rusticae dolaverunt,<BR>
interque cunctos ultimum deos numen<BR>
cucurbitarum ligneus vocor custos.<BR>
accedit istis impudentiae signum,<BR>
libidinoso tenta pyramis nervo.<BR>
ad hanc puella - paene nomen adieci -<BR>
solet venire cum suo fututore,<BR>
quae tot figuris, quot Philaenis enarrat,<BR>
non inventis, pruriosa discedit.</P>
<P>'Tis not enough, my friends, I set my seat<BR>
Where earth gapes chinky under Canicule,<BR>
Ever enduring thirsty summer's drought.<BR>
'Tis not enough the showers flow down my breast<BR>
And beat the hail-storms on my naked hair,<BR>
With beard fast frozen, rigid by the rime.<BR>
'Tis not enough that days in labour spent<BR>
Sleepless I lengthen through the nights as long.<BR>
Add that a godhead terrible of staff<BR>
Hewed me the rustic's rude unartful hand<BR>
And made me vilest of all deities,<BR>
Invoked as wooden guardian of the gourds.<BR>
And more, for shameless note to me was 'signed<BR>
With lustful nerve a pyramid distent,<BR>
Whereto a damsel (whom well nigh I'd named)<BR>
Is with her fornicator wont to come<BR>
And save in every mode Philaenis tells<BR>
Futtered, in furious lust her way she wends.</P>
<P>'Tis not enough, O friends, that I have fixed my abode here, where the earth gapes into chinks through the heat of the dog days, and that I daily endure the summer's drought; 'tis not enough that the rains flow down my bosom, that hail-storms beat amongst my bared locks, and that my beard frozen together is stiffened by the ice: 'tis too little that having spent the day in labour, I protract it, sleepless, through a night equally long. Add to this, that the unskilled hands of a rustic have chopped me, the awe-inspiring god with a cudgel, and that, amongst all the gods the lowest deity, I am called the wooden guardian of gourds. A pyramid [the virile member] stretched forth with libidinous vigour joins to these the symbol of shamelessness. Hither a damsel (I had almost added her name) is wont to come with her futterer: who if as many forms as Philaenis narrates she does not experience, she departs raging with unsated lust.</P>
