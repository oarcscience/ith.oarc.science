<P>Quicumque vestrum, qui venitis ad cenam,<BR>
libare nullos sustinet mihi versus,<BR>
illius uxor aut amica rivalem<BR>
lasciviendo languidum, precor, reddat,<BR>
et ipse longa nocte dormiat solus<BR>
libidinosis incitatus erucis.</P>
<P>Who of you people here shall come to sup<BR>
Yet bring no verses suited to my taste;<BR>
I pray his wife or punk, hot-wantoning,<BR>
Reduce his rival to most languid state;<BR>
While he, all lonely through the livelong night,<BR>
Lie, by the lustful rockets sore disturbed.</P>
<P>Whichever of you, who, coming to my banquet, abstains from inscribing to me any verses, I pray that his wife or mistress may make languid his rival with lascivious sporting, whilst he himself sleeps alone through the weary night, excited by lustful rockets.[1]</P>
