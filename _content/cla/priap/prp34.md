### To Priapus

Cum sacrum fieret deo salaci,  
conducta est pretio puella parvo  
communis satis omnibus futura,  
quae quot nocte viros peregit una,  
tot verpas tibi dedicat salignas.

At holy offering to the Lustful God  
Hired was a harlot for a slender price  
To meet the common wants of commonweal;  
And for as many men one night outworked  
So many willow yards she'll give to thee.

At a sacrifice made to the God of Lechery, a girl was cheaply hired as
sufficient for the wants of the common weal, who as many men she spent
in a single night, dedicates to thee so many willow-wood pokers.\[1\]

\[1. In the original Latin *verpa*, meaning the virile member. So called
from its similarity in shape to the instrument used in scouring furnace
fires. The damsel laid on the altar of Priapus, as ex-votos, a quantity
of wooden members equal in number to the men with whom she had had
connection in a single night. This seems to have been a customary
practice amongst the lower classes of women.

Juvenal relates how the Empress Messalina was accustomed in disguise to
visit a brothel at night, and borrowing her cell from Lycisca, one of
the courtesans, to show such capability for the work that she exhausted
all who cared to visit her, and returned to the palace in the early
morning, still raging with unsatisfied lust. It is said that within
twenty hours she surpassed the above-named courtesan by twenty-five
'rides'.\]
