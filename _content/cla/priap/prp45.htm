<P>Cum quendam rigidus deus videret<BR>
ferventi caput ustulare ferro,<BR>
ut Maurae similis foret puellae,<BR>
'heus' inquit 'tibi dicimus, cinaede,<BR>
uras te licet usque torqueasque,<BR>
num tandem prior es puella, quaeso,<BR>
quod sunt, mentula quos habet, capilli?'</P>
<P>Whenas the Rigid God espied a wight<BR>
Crisping his head with curling-tongs aglow<BR>
That he be likest to a Moorish maid,<BR>
'Ho thou! (cried he) we tell thee, catamite;<BR>
However much thou toast and curl thyself<BR>
Is then a damsel more of worth, I ask,<BR>
Than are the hairy honours of thy yard?'</P>
<P>When the Rigid God beheld an effeminate crisping his hair with the heated curling-irons, to liken himself to a Moorish damsel, 'Ho there, thou catamite,' quoth he. 'We tell thee, thou mayst crisp and curl to thy liking, but is a girl, prithee, of more value than are the hairs which deck thy mentule?'[2]</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. It needs no augur, because the girl's kisses have put the spear (although it is only wooden) into such a state of erection as self-evidently shows its willingness to swive her.</P>
<P>2. Is it worthwhile disturbing a hair even on thy mentule, much less thy head, to take the semblance of a girl?]</P>
