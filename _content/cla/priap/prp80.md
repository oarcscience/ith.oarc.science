### To Priapus

Priape, quod sis fascino gravis tento,  
quod exprobravit hanc tibi suo versu  
poeta noster, erubescere hoc noli:  
non es poeta sarcinosior nostro.

Although with yard distent (Priapus!) weighted  
(Wherewith our poet did reprove thee here  
In verse), on no wise deign thereat to blush;  
Thou be not heavier than our poet hung.

Priapus, though thou mayst be weighty with turgid *fascinum*, albeit our
poet in his verses has cast this in thy teeth, blush not for it. Thou
art not more heavily hung than is that poet of ours.

\[1. The word *fossis* (ditch) being plural in the original, Scaliger
suggests that Labdace had been overworking both in anus and coynte.\]
