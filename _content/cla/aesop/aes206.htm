<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The Boy Bathing</H1>
<P>A BOY bathing in a river was in danger of being drowned. He called out to a passing traveler for help, but instead of holding out a helping hand, the man stood by unconcernedly, and scolded the boy for his imprudence. "Oh, sir!" cried the youth, "pray help me now and scold me afterwards."</P>
<P>Counsel without help is useless.</P>
