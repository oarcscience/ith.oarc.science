# The Fly and the Draught-Mule

A FLY sat on the axle-tree of a chariot, and addressing the Draught-Mule
said, "How slow you are! Why do you not go faster? See if I do not prick
your neck with my sting." The Draught-Mule replied, "I do not heed your
threats; I only care for him who sits above you, and who quickens my
pace with his whip, or holds me back with the reins. Away, therefore,
with your insolence, for I know well when to go fast, and when to go
slow."
