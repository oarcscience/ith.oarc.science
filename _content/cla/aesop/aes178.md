# The Bull and the Calf

A BULL was striving with all his might to squeeze himself through a
narrow passage which led to his stall. A young Calf came up, and offered
to go before and show him the way by which he could manage to pass.
"Save yourself the trouble," said the Bull; "I knew that way long before
you were born."
