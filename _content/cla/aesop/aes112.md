# The Rivers and the Sea

THE RIVERS joined together to complain to the Sea, saying, "Why is it
that when we flow into your tides so potable and sweet, you work in us
such a change, and make us salty and unfit to drink?" The Sea,
perceiving that they intended to throw the blame on him, said, "Pray
cease to flow into me, and then you will not be made briny."
