<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The Traveler and His Dog</H1>
<P>A TRAVELER about to set out on a journey saw his Dog stand at the door stretching himself. He asked him sharply: "Why do you stand there gaping? Everything is ready but you, so come with me instantly." The Dog, wagging his tail, replied: "O, master! I am quite ready; it is you for whom I am waiting."</P>
<P>The loiterer often blames delay on his more active friend.</P>
