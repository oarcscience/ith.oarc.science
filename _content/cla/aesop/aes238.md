# The Dog's House

IN THE WINTERTIME, a Dog curled up in as small a space as possible on
account of the cold, determined to make himself a house. However when
the summer returned again, he lay asleep stretched at his full length
and appeared to himself to be of a great size. Now he considered that it
would be neither an easy nor a necessary work to make himself such a
house as would accommodate him.
