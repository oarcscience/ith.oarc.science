# The Old Man and Death

AN OLD MAN was employed in cutting wood in the forest, and, in carrying
the faggots to the city for sale one day, became very wearied with his
long journey. He sat down by the wayside, and throwing down his load,
besought "Death" to come. "Death" immediately appeared in answer to his
summons and asked for what reason he had called him. The Old Man
hurriedly replied, "That, lifting up the load, you may place it again
upon my shoulders."
