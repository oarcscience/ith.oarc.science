# The Mischievous Dog

A DOG used to run up quietly to the heels of everyone he met, and to
bite them without notice. His master suspended a bell about his neck so
that the Dog might give notice of his presence wherever he went.
Thinking it a mark of distinction, the Dog grew proud of his bell and
went tinkling it all over the marketplace. One day an old hound said to
him: Why do you make such an exhibition of yourself? That bell that you
carry is not, believe me, any order of merit, but on the contrary a mark
of disgrace, a public notice to all men to avoid you as an ill mannered
dog."

Notoriety is often mistaken for fame.
