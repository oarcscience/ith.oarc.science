<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The Thieves and the Cock</H1>
<P>SOME THIEVES broke into a house and found nothing but a Cock, whom they stole, and got off as fast as they could. Upon arriving at home they prepared to kill the Cock, who thus pleaded for his life: "Pray spare me; I am very serviceable to men. I wake them up in the night to their work." "That is the very reason why we must the more kill you," they replied; "for when you wake your neighbors, you entirely put an end to our business."</P>
<P>The safeguards of virtue are hateful to those with evil intentions.</P>
