# The Ass and the Horse

AN ASS besought a Horse to spare him a small portion of his feed. "Yes,"
said the Horse; "if any remains out of what I am now eating I will give
it you for the sake of my own superior dignity, and if you will come
when I reach my own stall in the evening, I will give you a little sack
full of barley." The Ass replied, "Thank you. But I can't think that
you, who refuse me a little matter now. will by and by confer on me a
greater benefit."
