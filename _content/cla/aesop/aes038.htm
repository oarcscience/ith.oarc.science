<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The Goat and the Goatherd</H1>
<P>A GOATHERD had sought to bring back a stray goat to his flock. He whistled and sounded his horn in vain; the straggler paid no attention to the summons. At last the Goatherd threw a stone, and breaking its horn, begged the Goat not to tell his master. The Goat replied, "Why, you silly fellow, the horn will speak though I be silent."</P>
<P>Do not attempt to hide things which cannot be hid.</P>
