# The Cat and the Mice

A CERTAIN HOUSE was overrun with Mice. A Cat, discovering this, made her
way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one. Fearing for
their lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their holes. The Cat was
no longer able to get at them and perceived that she must tempt them
forth by some device. For this purpose she jumped upon a peg, and
suspending herself from it, pretended to be dead. One of the Mice,
peeping stealthily out, saw her and said, "Ah, my good madam, even
though you should turn into a meal-bag, we will not come near you."
