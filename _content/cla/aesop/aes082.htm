<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The Crab and Its Mother</H1>
<P>A CRAB said to her son, "Why do you walk so one-sided, my child? It is far more becoming to go straight forward." The young Crab replied: "Quite true, dear Mother; and if you will show me the straight way, I will promise to walk in it." The Mother tried in vain, and submitted without remonstrance to the reproof of her child.</P>
<P>Example is more powerful than precept.</P>
