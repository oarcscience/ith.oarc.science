# The Two Bags

EVERY MAN, according to an ancient legend, is born into the world with
two bags suspended from his neck all bag in front full of his neighbors'
faults, and a large bag behind filled with his own faults. Hence it is
that men are quick to see the faults of others, and yet are often blind
to their own failings.
