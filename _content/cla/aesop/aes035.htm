<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The Oxen and the Axle-Trees</H1>
<P>A HEAVY WAGON was being dragged along a country lane by a team of Oxen. The Axle-trees groaned and creaked terribly; whereupon the Oxen, turning round, thus addressed the wheels: "Hullo there! why do you make so much noise? We bear all the labor, and we, not you, ought to cry out."</P>
<P>Those who suffer most cry out the least.</P>
