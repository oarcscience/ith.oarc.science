# The Wolf and the Lion

A WOLF, having stolen a lamb from a fold, was carrying him off to his
lair. A Lion met him in the path, and seizing the lamb, took it from
him. Standing at a safe distance, the Wolf exclaimed, "You have
unrighteously taken that which was mine from me!" To which the Lion
jeeringly replied, "It was righteously yours, eh? The gift of a friend?'
