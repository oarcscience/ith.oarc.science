# The Old Woman and the Wine-Jar

AN OLD WOMAN found an empty jar which had lately been full of prime old
wine and which still retained the fragrant smell of its former contents.
She greedily placed it several times to her nose, and drawing it
backwards and forwards said, "O most delicious! How nice must the Wine
itself have been, when it leaves behind in the very vessel which
contained it so sweet a perfume!"

The memory of a good deed lives.
