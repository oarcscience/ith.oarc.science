# The Milk-Woman and Her Pail

A FARMER'S daughter was carrying her Pail of milk from the field to the
farmhouse, when she fell a-musing. "The money for which this milk will
be sold, will buy at least three hundred eggs. The eggs, allowing for
all mishaps, will produce two hundred and fifty chickens. The chickens
will become ready for the market when poultry will fetch the highest
price, so that by the end of the year I shall have money enough from my
share to buy a new gown. In this dress I will go to the Christmas
parties, where all the young fellows will propose to me, but I will toss
my head and refuse them every one." At this moment she tossed her head
in unison with her thoughts, when down fell the milk pail to the ground,
and all her imaginary schemes perished in a moment.
