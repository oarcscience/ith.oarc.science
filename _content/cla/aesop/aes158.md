# The Bald Knight

A BALD KNIGHT, who wore a wig, went out to hunt. A sudden puff of wind
blew off his hat and wig, at which a loud laugh rang forth from his
companions. He pulled up his horse, and with great glee joined in the
joke by saying, "What a marvel it is that hairs which are not mine
should fly from me, when they have forsaken even the man on whose head
they grew."
