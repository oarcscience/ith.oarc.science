# The Fisherman and the Little Fish

A FISHERMAN who lived on the produce of his nets, one day caught a
single small Fish as the result of his day's labor. The Fish, panting
convulsively, thus entreated for his life: "O Sir, what good can I be to
you, and how little am I worth? I am not yet come to my full size. Pray
spare my life, and put me back into the sea. I shall soon become a large
fish fit for the tables of the rich, and then you can catch me again,
and make a handsome profit of me." The Fisherman replied, "I should
indeed be a very simple fellow if, for the chance of a greater uncertain
profit, I were to forego my present certain gain."
