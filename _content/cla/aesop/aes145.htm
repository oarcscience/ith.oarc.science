<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The Seagull and the Kite</H1>
<P>A SEAGULL having bolted down too large a fish, burst its deep gullet-bag and lay down on the shore to die. A Kite saw him and exclaimed: "You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air has no business to seek its food from the sea."</P>
<P>Every man should be content to mind his own business.</P>
