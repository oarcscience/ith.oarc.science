<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The Lion and the Three Bulls</H1>
<P>THREE BULLS for a long time pastured together. A Lion lay in ambush in the hope of making them his prey, but was afraid to attack them while they kept together. Having at last by guileful speeches succeeded in separating them, he attacked them without fear as they fed alone, and feasted on them one by one at his own leisure.</P>
<P>Union is strength.</P>
