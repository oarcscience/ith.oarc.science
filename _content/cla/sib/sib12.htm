<P>BUT come now, hear of me the mournful time<BR>
Of sons of Latium; and first of all<BR>
After the kings of Egypt were destroyed,<BR>
And the like earth had downwards borne them all,<BR>
5 And after Pella's townsman, under whom<BR>
The whole East and the rich West were cast down,<BR>
Whom Babylon dishonored, and stretched out<BR>
For Philip a dead body (not of Zeus,<BR>
Of Ammon not true things were prophesied),<BR>
10 And after that one of the race and blood<BR>
Of king Assaracus, who came from Troy,<BR>
Even he who cleft the violence of fire,<BR>
And after many lords, and after men<BR>
To Ares dear, and after the young babes,<BR>
15 The children of the beast that feeds on sheep,<BR>
And after the passing of six hundred years<BR>
And decades two of Rome's dictatorship,<BR>
The very first lord, from the western sea,<BR>
Shall be of Rome the ruler, very strong<BR>
20 And warlike, the initial of whose name<BR>
Begins the letters, and fast binding thee,<BR>
O thou of goodly fruit, he shall be full<BR>
Of man-destroying Ares; thou shalt pay</P>

<P>The outrage which thou willing didst force on;<BR>
For he, great soul, shall be the best in wars;<BR>
25 Before him Thrace and Sicily shall crouch,<BR>
With Memphis, Memphis cast headlong to earth<BR>
By reason of the wickedness of rulers<BR>
And of a woman unenslaved who falls<BR>
Under the spear. And laws will he ordain<BR>
30 For peoples and put all things under him;<BR>
Having great fame he shall wield scepter long;<BR>
For no short time shall he last nor shall ever<BR>
Be other greater scepter-bearing king<BR>
35 Than this one, o'er the Romans, not one hour,<BR>
For God did lavish all things upon him,<BR>
And also in the noble earth he showed<BR>
Great marvelous seasons, and with them showed signs.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when a radiant star all like the sun<BR>
40 Shall shine forth out of heaven in the mid days,<BR>
Then shall the secret Word of the Most High<BR>
Come clothed in flesh like mortals; but with him<BR>
The might of Rome and of the illustrious Latins<BR>
Shall increase. But the mighty king himself<BR>
45 Shall under his appointed lot expire,<BR>
Transmitting to another royal power.<BR>
But after him a man, a warrior strong,<BR>
Wearing the purple mantle on his shoulders,<BR>
Shall bear rule, and with his initial be<BR>
50 Numbers three hundred, and he shall destroy<BR>
The Medes and arrow-hurling Parthians;<BR>
And he himself by his power shall subvert</P>

Evil to Egypt and the Assyrians,<BR>
55 And to the Colchian Heniochi,<BR>
And to those by the waters of the Rhine,<BR>
The Germans dwelling o'er the sandy shores.<BR>
And he himself shall ravage afterwards<BR>
The high-gate city near Eridanus<BR>
60 Which is devising evils. And then he<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall forthwith fall down, struck by gleaming iron.<BR>
And afterwards shall rule another man<BR>
Weaving guile, and the initial of his name<BR>
Will show the number three; and he much gold<BR>
65 Shall gather; and with him there shall not be<BR>
Satiety of wealth, but plundering more<BR>
Recklessly he'll put all things in the earth.<BR>
But peace shall come, and Ares shall desist<BR>
From wars; and he shall make known many things<BR>
70 In divination of the greatest things,<BR>
Inquiring for the sake of means of life;<BR>
Yet there shall be on him the greatest sign:<BR>
From heaven down on the king while perishing<BR>
There shall flow many little drops of blood.<BR>
75 And many lawless things will he perform,<BR>
And put around the neck of Romans pain<BR>
Trusting in divination; and the heads<BR>
Of the assembly he will also slay.<BR>
And famine shall seize Cappadocians,<BR>

And the king himself beguiling secretly<BR>
Shall craftily destroy the virgin maid;<BR>
But her the citizens in tearful grief<BR>
85 Shall bury; and against the king they all<BR>
Holding wrath shall abuse him craftily.<BR>
While strong Rome blossoms the strong man shall perish.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And again there shall rule another lord<BR>
Of the number of twice ten; and then shall come<BR>
90 Unto the Sauromatians and to Thrace<BR>
And the Triballi, famed for hurling darts,<BR>
Wars and sad cares; and Roman Ares shall<BR>
Tear all in pieces. And a fearful sign<BR>
Shall there be when this man shall rule the land<BR>
95 Of the Italians and Pannonians;<BR>
And there shall be at the mid hour of day<BR>
Dark night around them and then from the heaven<BR>
A shower of stones; and thereupon the lord<BR>
And vigorous judge of the Italians<BR>
100 Shall go in Hades' halls by his own fate.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again another fearful man shall come<BR>
And dreadful, numbering fifty; and from all<BR>
The cities many noblest citizens<BR>
Born to wealth he shall utterly destroy,<BR>
105 A dreadful serpent breathing grievous war,<BR>
Who sometime stretching forth his hands shall make<BR>

<P>Putting to death and daring countless things;<BR>
110 And he shall cleave the mountain of two seas,<BR>
And sprinkle it with gore. And out of sight<BR>
Shall also vanish the destructive man;<BR>
Then making himself equal unto God<BR>
Shall he return, but God will prove him naught.<BR>
115 And while he rules there shall be peace profound<BR>
And not the fears of men; and from the ocean<BR>
Flowing, and cleaving by Ausonia,<BR>
Shall come untrodden water; and around<BR>
Looking with anxious care he will appoint<BR>
120 His very many contests for the people,<BR>
And he himself an actor will contend<BR>
With voice and cithara, and sing a song<BR>
Along with harp-string; later he will flee<BR>
And leave the royal power, and perishing<BR>
125 Illy will he repay the harm he wrought.<BR>

Shall have the number seventy by their names,<BR>
And in addition to these shall be one<BR>

130 Shall perish by strong Ares' sturdy hands.<BR>
Then shall a mighty ruler of men come,<BR>
Destroyer of the pious, strong-minded man,<BR>
Spear-wielding Ares, whom seven times the tenth<BR>
Shall point out clearly; he shall overthrow<BR>
135 Phœnicia and destroy Assyria.<BR>
A sword shall come upon the sacred land<BR>
Of Solyma even to the utmost bend<BR>
Of the Tiberian sea. Alas, alas,<BR>
Phœnicia, O how much shalt thou endure,<BR>

<P>And every nation shall upon thee tread.<BR>
Alas, alas, to the Assyrians<BR>
Shalt thou come and shalt see young children serve<BR>
Among unfriendly men and with the wives,<BR>
145 And every means of life and wealth shall perish;<BR>
For on thee God's wrath causing grievous woe<BR>
Shall come, because they did not keep his law,<BR>
But served all idols with unseemly arts.<BR>
And many wars and fights and homicides,<BR>
150 Famines, and pestilences, and confusion<BR>
Of cities shall be. But the reverend king<BR>
Of mighty soul shall at the end of life<BR>
Himself fall by a strong necessity.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then shall two other chief men, cherishing<BR>
155 The memory of their father, great king, rule,<BR>
And in contending warriors glory much.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And (one) of these shall be a noble man<BR>
And lordly, whose name shall three hundred hold;<BR>
Yet he shall also fall by treachery,<BR>
160 Not in the warring companies stretched out,<BR>
But struck in Rome's plain by the two-edged brass.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after him a powerful warlike man<BR>
Of the letter four shall rule the mighty realm,<BR>
Whom all men on the boundless earth shall love,<BR>
165 And then shall there be over all the world<BR>
A rest from war. Yet all, from west to east,<BR>
Shall serve him willingly, not by constraint,<BR>
And cities shall be under his control<BR>
And of themselves be subject. For to him<BR>
170 Shall heavenly Sabaoth much glory bring,<BR>
The imperishable God who dwells on high.</P>

<P>And then shall famine waste Pannonia<BR>
And all the Celtic land, and shall destroy<BR>
One here, another there. And there shall be<BR>
175 For the Assyrians, whom Orontes laves,<BR>
Structures and ornament and what may seem<BR>
Yet greater anywhere. And the great king<BR>
Shall have a fondness for these and love them<BR>
Above the others far (and there are many);<BR>
180 But he himself shall in mid breast receive<BR>
A great wound, and seized at the end of life<BR>
Craftily, by a friend, in hallowed house<BR>
Of the great royal hall shall he fall down<BR>
Wounded; and after him shall be a ruler<BR>
185 Numbering fifty, venerable man,<BR>
Who above measure shall destroy from Rome<BR>
Many inhabitants and citizens;<BR>
But he shall rule few; for in Hades' halls<BR>
For a former king's sake he shall wounded go.<BR>
190&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then another king, a warrior strong,<BR>
Who has three hundred for initial sign,<BR>
Shall bear rule and lay waste the Thracians' land<BR>
Which is much varied, and he shall destroy<BR>
The powerful Germans dwelling by the Rhine<BR>
195 And the Iberians that shoot the arrow.<BR>
Moreover, there shall be unto the Jews<BR>
Another greatest evil, and with them<BR>
Bedewed with murder shall Phœnicia drink;<BR>
And the walls of the Assyrians shall fall<BR>
200 By many warriors. And again a man<BR>
Destroying life shall waste them utterly.</P>

<P>And Phrygia shall with earthquakes groan again<BR>
Wretched. Alas, alas, Laodicea;<BR>
Alas, alas, sad Hierapolis;<BR>
360 For you first once the yawning earth received.<BR>
Of Rome . . . immense Aus . . .<BR>
All things as many . . .<BR>
Shall wail . . . while men are perishing<BR>
In the hands of Ares; and the lot of men<BR>
365 Shall be bad; but then by the eastern way<BR>
Hastening to look down upon Italy,<BR>
Stripped naked he shall fall by gleaming iron,<BR>
Acquiring hatred for his mother's sake.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For seasons are of all sorts; each holds back<BR>
370 The other . . . gleaming and this not at once all know;<BR>
For all things shall not be (the lot) of all,<BR>
But only those shall be for happiness<BR>
Who honor God and shun idolatry.<BR>
And now, Lord of the world, of every realm<BR>
375 Unfeigned immortal King--for thou didst put<BR>
Into my heart the oracle divine--<BR>
Make thou the word cease; for I do not know<BR>
What things I say; for thou art in me he<BR>
That speaketh all these things. Now let me rest<BR>
380 A little and put from my heart aside<BR>
The charming song; for weary is my heart<BR>
Foretelling with divine words royal power.</P>
