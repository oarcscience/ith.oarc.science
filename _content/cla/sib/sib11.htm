<P>O WORLD of men wide-scattered, and long walls,<BR>
The cities huge and nations numberless,<BR>
Throughout the east and west and south and north,<BR>
Divided off by various languages<BR>
5 And kingdoms; other things, the very worst,<BR>
Against you I am now about to speak.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For from the time when on the earlier men<BR>
The flood came and the Almighty One himself<BR>
Destroyed that race by many waters, then<BR>
10 Brought he in yet another race of men<BR>
Untiring; and they, setting themselves up<BR>
Against heaven, built to height unspeakable<BR>
A tower; and tongues of all were loosed again;<BR>
And on them hurled came wrath of God most high,<BR>
15 By which the tower unutterably great<BR>
Fell; and against each other they stirred up<BR>
An evil strife. And then of mortal men<BR>
Was the tenth race since these things came to pass;</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The four following books were first published by Angelo Mai, in 1828, and in the manuscripts and in the editions of Alexandre and Rzach are numbered xi-xiv. There would seem, therefore, to have existed two other books, ix and x, which may yet come to light, as did books xi-xiv after various printed editions of the first eight books had appeared. We deem it better, therefore, to adhere to the numbering of the manuscripts and the two principal editions of the Greek text than with Friedlieb to number these later books as ix-xii. This eleventh book deals largely with matters of Egyptian history, but contains also various oracles against other nations. Its date and authorship are uncertain.</P>

<P>And the whole earth was among foreign men<BR>
20 And various languages distributed,<BR>
Whose numbers I will tell and in acrostics<BR>
Of the initial letter show the name.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And first shall Egypt royal power receive<BR>
Preeminent and just; and then in her<BR>
25 Shall many-counseling men be governors;<BR>
Moreover then a fearful man shall rule,<BR>
Close-fighter very strong; and he shall have<BR>
This letter of the acrostic of his name:<BR>
Sword shall he stretch out against pious men.<BR>
30 And while this one is ruler there shall be<BR>
A fearful sign in the Egyptian land,<BR>
Which, gladdening very greatly, shall with corn<BR>
Souls perishing with famine then supply;<BR>
The law-giver, himself a prisoner,<BR>
35 The East and offspring of Assyrian men<BR>
Shall nourish; and his name know thou . . .<BR>
. . . of the measure of the number ten.<BR>
But when there shall come from the radiant heaven<BR>
Ten strokes of judgment upon Egypt, then<BR>
40 Will I again proclaim these things to thee.<BR>
Memphis, alas, alas for thee! alas,<BR>
Great royal one! the Erythr&aelig;an sea<BR>
Shall thy much people utterly destroy.</P>

<P>Then when the people of twelve tribes shall leave<BR>
45 The fruitful land of ruin by command<BR>
Of the Immortal, the Lord God himself<BR>
Will also give a law unto mankind.<BR>
And o'er the Hebrews then a mighty king<BR>
Magnanimous shall rule, and have a name<BR>
50 Derived from sandy Egypt, Theban man<BR>
Of doubtful native land; and Memphis he,<BR>
Dread serpent, will show outward signs of love,<BR>
And he will watch o'er many things in wars.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the tenth kingdom being twelve times complete<BR>
55 Seven besides and even unto the tenth hundred,<BR>
Others being altogether left behind,<BR>
Then shall arise the Persian sovereignty.<BR>
And then an evil shall befall the Jews,<BR>
Famine and pestilence intolerable<BR>
60 They do not make escape from in that day.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when a Persian shall rule, and a son<BR>
Of his son's son shall lay the scepter down,<BR>
While years roll round to five fours, and to these<BR>
A hundred more, and thou a hundred nines<BR>
65 Shalt finish and all things shalt thou repay;<BR>
And then unto the Persians and the Medes<BR>
Shalt thou be given over as a slave,<BR>
Destroyed with blows by reason of hard fights.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straightway to Persians and Assyrians<BR>
70 And to all Egypt shall an evil come,<BR>
And to Libya and the Ethiopians,<BR>
And to the Carians and Pamphylians<BR>
And to all other mortals. And he then</P>

<P>Shall to the grandsons give the royal power,<BR>
75 Who again snatching the whole earth away<BR>
Shall plunder races for their many spoils,<BR>
Not having fellow-feeling. Mournful dirges<BR>
Shall the sad Persians by the Tigris wail,<BR>
And Egypt water many a land with tears.<BR>
80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then to thee, O Median land, a man<BR>
Of wealth abundant and of Indian birth<BR>
Shall many evils do, till thou repay<BR>
All things which thou, possessed of shameless soul,<BR>
Hast done before. Alas, alas for thee,<BR>
85 Thou Median nation; thou shalt afterwards<BR>
Be servant unto Ethiopian men<BR>
Beyond the land of Meroe; wretched thou<BR>
Shalt from the first seven and a hundred years<BR>
Complete, and put thy neck beneath the yoke.<BR>
90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then an Indian of dark countenance<BR>
And gray hair and great soul shall afterwards<BR>
Become lord, who shall many evils bring<BR>
Upon the East by reason of hard fights;<BR>
And he shall treat thee more despitefully<BR>
95 And shall destroy all thy men. But when he<BR>
The twentieth and the tenth year shall be king,<BR>
Among them, also seven and the tenth,<BR>
Then every nation of a royal power<BR>
Shall be mad and declare their liberty,<BR>
100 And during three years leave their servile blood.<BR>
But he shall come again and every nation<BR>
Of valiant men shall put their neck again<BR>
Under the yoke, serve the king as before,<BR>
And of its own free will again obey.<BR>
105 There shall be great peace throughout all the world.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then o'er the Assyrians there shall rule<BR>
A mighty king, a man preeminent,<BR>
And shall persuade all to speak pleasing things,<BR>
Which God ordained according to the law;<BR>
110 Then all kings arrogant with pointed spears<BR>
Timid and speechless shall before him quail,<BR>
And him shall very powerful rulers serve<BR>
Because of counsels of the mighty God;<BR>
For he will carry all things in detail<BR>
115 By reason, and all things will he subject,<BR>
And he the temple of the mighty God<BR>
And lovely altar will himself erect<BR>
In his might, and will hurl the idols down;<BR>
And gathering tribes together, both the race<BR>
120 Of fathers and the helpless little ones,<BR>
He shall encompass the inhabitants;<BR>
His name shall have two hundred for its number,<BR>
And of the eighteenth letter show the sign.<BR>
But when for rolling decades two and five<BR>
125 He shall rule, going forwards towards the end<BR>
Of his time, there shall be as many kings<BR>
As there are tribes of men, as there are clans,<BR>
As there are cities, and as isles and coasts,<BR>
And fields and lands that bring forth goodly fruit.<BR>
130 But one of these shall be a mighty king,<BR>
A leader among men; and many kings<BR>
Of lofty spirit shall submit to him,<BR>
And to his sons and grandsons opulent<BR>
Give portions on account of royal power.</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when with cruel Ares there shall come<BR>
A powerful wild beast, even then for thee,<BR>
O queenly land, shall wrath spring forth again.<BR>
140&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, alas for thee, then Persian land;<BR>
What an outpouring of the blood of men<BR>
Shalt thou receive when that stronger-minded man<BR>
Comes to thee; then I'll shout these things again.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Italian soil shall generate,<BR>
145 Great wonder unto mortals, there shall be<BR>
Moans of young children by a fountain pure,<BR>
In shady cavern off spring of wild beast<BR>
That feeds on sheep, who unto manhood grown<BR>
Shall upon seven strong hills with reckless soul<BR>
150 Hurl many headlong down, in numbers both<BR>
Having a hundred, and their names shall show<BR>
A great sign to them that are yet to be;<BR>
And they shall build upon the seven hills<BR>
Strong walls and wage around them grievous war.<BR>

A great stroke in thy houses; and again<BR>

Now over thee, O wretched Phrygia,<BR>
I weep in pity; for to thee from Greece,<BR>
Tamer of horses, there shall conquest come<BR>
And war and plague by reason of hard fights.<BR>
165 Ilium, I pity thee; for there shall come<BR>
From Sparta an Erinys to thy halls<BR>
Mixed with a deadly sting; and most of all<BR>
Shall she bring thee toils, troubles, groans, and wails,<BR>
When well-skilled men the battle shall begin,<BR>

Who are to Ares dear. And one of these<BR>
Shall be a strong brave king; of foulest deeds<BR>
He for his brother's sake will go in quest.<BR>
And they shall overthrow the famous walls<BR>
175 Of Phrygian Troy; when of the rolling years<BR>
Twice five shall be filled with the bloody deeds<BR>
Of savage war, a wooden artifice<BR>
Shall sudden cover men, and on thy knees<BR>
Thou shalt receive this, not perceiving it<BR>
180 To be an ambush pregnant with the Greeks,<BR>
O cause of grievous woe. Alas, alas,<BR>
How much in one night Hades shall receive,<BR>
And what spoils of the old man weeping much<BR>
Shall he bear off! But with those yet to come<BR>

A hero sprung from Zeus, shall have his name<BR>

And he shall have a trisyllabic name,<BR>

And Lydians, Thracians and Bithynians,<BR>

Through every isthmus, going against all,<BR>

For thee, O dusky land, shall there be wars<BR>
And battles and great slaughter of mankind.<BR>
345&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When many over fertile Rome shall rule,<BR>
Examples not at all of happy men,<BR>
But tyrants, and there be of thousands chiefs<BR>
And of ten thousands, and the overseers<BR>
Of popular assemblies under law,<BR>
350 Then shall the mightiest C&aelig;sars bear the rule<BR>
Ill-fated all their days; and of these last<BR>
Shall for initial have the number ten,<BR>
Last C&aelig;sar stretching on the earth his limbs,<BR>
Struck by dire Ares by a hostile man,<BR>
355 Whom carrying in their hands the youth of Rome<BR>
Shall. bury piously, and over him<BR>
Pour out their token for his friendship's sake<BR>
Rendering a tribute to his memory.<BR>

360 And hast completed twice three hundred years<BR>
And twice ten, from the time when he shall rule<BR>
Who is thy founder, child of the wild beast,<BR>
There shall no longer a dictator be<BR>
Ruling a measured period; but a lord<BR>
365 Shall become king, man equal to the gods.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Egypt, know the king that comes to thee;<BR>
And dreadful Ares of the glittering helm<BR>
Shall surely come. For there shall be for thee,</P>

<P>O widowed one, a capture afterwards;<BR>
370 For round the walls of thy land there shall be<BR>
Terrible raging mischief-working wars.<BR>
But having suffered misery in wars<BR>
Thou, wretched, shalt thyself flee from above<BR>
Those lately wounded; and then to the couch<BR>
375 Shalt thou come to the dreadful man himself;<BR>
The wedlock, sharing one bed, is the end.<BR>
Alas, alas for thee, ill-wedded bride,<BR>
Thy royal power unto the Roman king<BR>
Shalt thou give, and thou shalt repay all things,<BR>
380 Which thou aforetime didst with masculine hands;<BR>
Thou shalt give the whole land by way of dower<BR>
As far as Libya and the dark-skinned men<BR>
To the resistless man. And thou shalt be<BR>
No more a widow, but thou shalt cohabit<BR>
385 With a man-eating lion terrible,<BR>
A furious warrior. And then shalt thou be<BR>
Unhappy and among all men unknown;<BR>
For thou shalt leave possessed of shameless soul;<BR>
And thee, the stately, shall the encircling tomb<BR>
390 Receive . . . is gone . . . living within . . .<BR>
Adapted at the summits, beautiful,<BR>
Wrought curiously, and a great multitude<BR>
Shall mourn thee and the dreadful king shall make<BR>
A piteous lamentation over thee.<BR>
