<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great Son of the Immortal famed in song<BR>
I from the heart proclaim, to whom a throne,<BR>
To be held fast the most Father gave<BR>
Ere, he was brought forth; then was he raised up<BR>
5 According to flesh given, washed, at the mouth<BR>
Of the river Jordan, which goes rushing on<BR>
Trailing its gleaming billows, from the fire<BR>
Escaping he first shall see God's sweet Spirit<BR>
Descending with the wings of a white dove.<BR>
10 And a pure flower shall bloom, and springs be full.<BR>
And he shall show the ways to men, and show<BR>
The heavenly paths, and teach all with wise<BR>
And he shall come for judgement and persuade<BR>
A disobedient people while he boasts<BR>
15 Descent praiseworthy from a heavenly Sire.<BR>
Billows shall he tread, sickness of mankind<BR>
Shall he destroy, he shall raise up the dead,<BR>
And many sufferings shall he drive away;<BR>
And from one scrip shall be men's fill of bread,</P>

<P>20 When the house of David shall bring forth a child;<BR>
And in his hand the whole world, earth, heaven, sea.<BR>
And he shall flash upon the earth, as once<BR>
The two begotten from each other's ribs<BR>
Saw human form appearing. It shall be<BR>
25 When earth shall be glad in the hope of child.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for thee only, Sodomitic land,<BR>
Are evil woes laid up; for thou thyself<BR>
Ill-disposed didst not apprehend thy God<BR>
Who mocks at mortal schemes; but from a thorn<BR>
30 Didst crown him with a crown, and fearful gall<BR>
Didst mingle unto insolence and spirit.<BR>
This shall bring evil woes about for thee.<BR>
O the Wood, O so blessed, upon which<BR>
God was outstretched; the earth shall not have thee,<BR>
35 But thou shalt look upon a heavenly house,<BR>
When thou, O God, shalt flash thine eye of fire.</P>
