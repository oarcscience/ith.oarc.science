<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">BOOK I.</H3>
<P>BEGINNING with the generation first<BR>
Of mortal men down to the very last<BR>
I'll prophesy each thing: what erst has been,<BR>
And what is now, and what shall yet befall<BR>
5 The world through the impiety of men.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First now God urges on me to relate<BR>
Truly how into being came the world.<BR>
And thou, shrewd mortal, prudently make known,<BR>
Lest ever thou should'st my commands neglect,<BR>
10 The King most high, who brought into existence<BR>
The whole world, saying, "Let there be," and there was.<BR>
For he the earth established, placing it<BR>
Round about Tartarus, and he himself</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. This book appears to be one of the latest in composition of this entire collection of oracles, but it was placed first on account of its contents, which relate to the creation and the earliest races of mankind. It is evidently of Christian origin, and was written probably as late as the third century.</P>
<P>13. <I>Tartartus</I>, the prison of the Titans, is here conceived as encompassed by the earth and forming its interior. Hesiod (<I>Theog.</I>, 720, <I>ff</I>) represents it as surrounded by a brazen fence and situated as far beneath the earth as earth is beneath the heaven; it would require nine days and nights, he says, for an anvil to fall from heaven to earth, and as many more for it to fall from earth to Tartarus. Comp. Homer, <I>Il</I>., viii, 13-16. Verg., <I>&AElig;n</I>., vi, 577-581. It will be seen in line 127 and elsewhere that Gehenna is regarded as a part of Tartarus or identical with it, while Hades (line 106) comprehends the abode of all the dead.]</P>

<P>Gave the sweet light; he raised the heaven on high,<BR>
15 Spread out the gleaming sea, and crowned the sky<BR>
With an abundance of bright-shining stars,<BR>
And decked the earth with plants, and mingled sea<BR>
With rivers, and the air with zephyrs mixed<BR>
And watery clouds; and then, another race<BR>
20 Appointing, he gave fishes to the seas<BR>
And birds unto the winds, and to the woods<BR>
The beasts of shaggy neck, and snakes that crawl,<BR>
And all things which now on the earth appear.<BR>
These by his word he made, and every thing<BR>
25 Was speedily and with precision done;<BR>
For he was self-caused and from heaven looked down<BR>
And finished was the world exceeding well.<BR>
And then thereafter fashioned he again<BR>
A living product, copying a new man<BR>
30 From his own image, beautiful, divine,<BR>
And bade him in ambrosial garden dwell,<BR>
That labors beautiful might be his care.<BR>
But in that fertile field of Paradise<BR>
He longed for conversation, being alone,<BR>
35 And prayed that he might see another form<BR>
Such as he had. And forthwith, from man's side<BR>
Taking a bone, God himself made fair Eve,<BR>
A wedded spouse, and in that Paradise<BR>
Gave her to dwell with him. And, when he gazed<BR>
40 Upon her, on a sudden filled with joy<BR>
Great admiration held his soul, he saw<BR>
A pattern so exact; and with wise words<BR>
Spontaneous flowing answered he in turn<BR>
For God had care for all things. For the mind<BR>
45 They darkened not with passion, nor concealed<BR>
Their nakedness, but with hearts far from evil</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(11-36.)</P>
<P>{p. 17}</P>
<P>Even like wild beasts they walked with limbs exposed.<BR>
And afterwards delivering them commands<BR>
God showed them not to touch a certain tree;<BR>
50 But the dread serpent drew them off by guile<BR>
To go away unto the fate of death<BR>
And to gain knowledge of both good and evil.<BR>
But the wife then first traitress proved to God;<BR>
She gave, and urged the unknowing man to sin.<BR>
55 And he, persuaded by the woman's words,<BR>
Forgot the immortal Maker utterly,<BR>
And treated plain commandments with neglect.<BR>
Therefore, instead of good, received they evil<BR>
According to their deed. And then the leaves<BR>
60 Of the sweet fig-tree piercing they made clothes<BR>
And put them on each other, and concealed<BR>
The sexual parts, because they were ashamed.<BR>
But on them the Immortal set his wrath<BR>
And cast them out of the immortal land.<BR>
65 For their abiding now in mortal land<BR>
Was brought to pass, since hearing they kept not<BR>
The word of the immortal mighty God.<BR>
And straightway they, upon the fruitful soil<BR>
Forthgoing, with their tears and groans were wet;<BR>
70 And to them then the immortal God himself<BR>
A word more excellent spoke: "Multiply,<BR>
Increase, work constantly upon the earth,<BR>
That with the sweat of labor ye may have<BR>
Sufficient food." Thus he spoke; and he made<BR>
75 The author of deceit to press the ground<BR>
On belly and on side, a crawling snake,<BR>
Driving him out severely; and he sent<BR>
Dire enmity between them and the one</P>

<P>Is on the look-out to preserve his head,<BR>
80 But man his heel; for death is neighbor near<BR>
Of evil-plotting vipers and of men.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then indeed the race was multiplied<BR>
As the Almighty himself gave command,<BR>
And there grew up one people on another<BR>
85 Innumerable. And houses they adorned<BR>
Of all kinds and made cities and their walls<BR>
Well and expertly; and to them was given<BR>
A day of long time for a life much-loved;<BR>
For they did not worn out with troubles die,<BR>
90 But as subdued by sleep; most happy men<BR>
Of great heart, whom the immortal Saviour loved,<BR>
The King, God. But they also did transgress,<BR>
Smitten with folly. For with impudence<BR>
They mocked their fathers and their mothers scorned;<BR>
95 Kinsmen they knew not, and they formed intrigues<BR>
Against their brothers. And they were impure,<BR>
Having defiled themselves with human gore,<BR>
And they made wars. And then upon them came<BR>
The last calamity sent forth from heaven,<BR>
100 Which snatched the dreadful men away from life;<BR>
And Hades then received them; it was called<BR>
Hades since Adam, having tasted death,<BR>
Went first and earth encompassed him around.<BR>
And therefore all men born upon the earth<BR>
105 Are in abodes of Hades called to go.</P>

<P>But even in Hades all these when they came<BR>
Had honor, since they were the earliest race.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Hades received these, secondly<BR>
[Of the surviving and most righteous men]<BR>
110 God formed another very subtile race<BR>
That cared for lovely works, and noble toils,<BR>
Distinguished reverence and solid wisdom;<BR>
And they were trained in arts of every kind,<BR>
Finding inventions by their lack of means.<BR>
115 And one devised to till the land with plows,<BR>
Another worked in wood, another cared<BR>
For sailing, and another watched the stars<BR>
And practiced augury with winged fowls;<BR>
And use of drugs had interest for one,<BR>
120 While for another magic had a charm;<BR>
And others were in every other art<BR>
Which men care for instructed, wide awake,<BR>
Industrious, worthy of that eponym<BR>
Because they had a sleepless mind within<BR>
125 And a huge body; stout with mighty form<BR>
They were; but, notwithstanding, down they went<BR>
Into Tartarean chamber terrible,<BR>
Kept in firm chains to pay full penalty<BR>
In Gehenna of strong, furious, quenchless fire.<BR>
130&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after these a third strong-minded race<BR>
Appeared, a race of overbearing men<BR>
And terrible, who wrought among themselves</P>

<P>Many an evil. And fights, homicides,<BR>
And battles did continually destroy<BR>
135 Those men possessed of overweening heart,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from these afterward another race<BR>
Proceeded, late-completed, youngest born,<BR>
Blood-stained, perverse in counsel; of men these<BR>
Were in the fourth race; much the blood they spilled,<BR>
140 Nor feared they God nor had regard for men,<BR>
For maddening wrath and sore impiety<BR>
Were sent upon them. And wars, homicides,<BR>
And battles sent some into Erebus,<BR>
Since they were overweening impious men.<BR>
145 But the rest did the heavenly God himself<BR>
In anger afterwards change from his world,<BR>
Casting them into mighty Tartarus<BR>
Down under the foundation of the earth.<BR>
And later yet another race much worse<BR>
150 [Of men he made, to whom no good thereafter]<BR>
The Immortal formed, since they wrought many evils.<BR>
For they were much more violent than those,<BR>
Giants perverse, foul language pouring out.<BR>
Single among all men, most just and true,<BR>
155 Was the most faithful Noah, full of care<BR>
For noblest works. And to him God himself<BR>
From heaven thus spoke: "Noah, be of good cheer<BR>
In thyself and to all the people preach<BR>
Repentance, so that they may all be saved.<BR>

An undecaying house I bid thee frame<BR>
Of planks strong and impervious to the wet.<BR>
165 I will put understanding in thy heart,<BR>
And subtile skill, and rule of measurement<BR>
And order; and for all things will I care<BR>
That thou be saved, and all who dwell with thee.<BR>
And I am He who is, and in thy heart<BR>
170 Do thou discern. I clothe me with the heaven,<BR>

Two letters, the remaining one the rest,<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[175. <I>Nine letters</I>.--The connection shows that the name intended must be some title or designation of the Creator, but no word has been discovered that fully meets the conditions of the puzzle. The nearest solution is found in the word {Greek <I>?ane'kfwnows</I>}. This word has nine letters, four syllables, and five mutes, or consonants. The first three syllables have two letters each, and the sum of all the letters taken at their numerical value is 1,696. But the number stated in the text is twice 800, plus three times thirty (= 90) and seven = 1,697. {Greek <I>?ane'kfwnows</I>} must also be supposed to be a shortened form for {Greek <I>?anekfw'nhtos</I>}, used in ecclesiastical Greek writers to denote the unutterable name, Jehovah. Another name proposed is {Greek <I>&ETH;eo`s Swth'r</I>}, but an obvious objection is that we have here two words, not, as the text suggests, one word of four syllables. Besides, these letters amount to only 1,692. There is, perhaps, an error in the text. If for the words with seven (line 180) we read with two, the numerical difficulty of the last-named solution would be met; or if we read with six, then the word {Greek <I>?ane'kfwnos</I>} solves the problem. Comp. the similar puzzle in lines 395-399 of this same book, and the well-known {footnote p. 22} enigma of the number of the beast in Rev. xiii, 18. A like example is also found in Capella (book ii, 193), who thus addresses the sun: "Hail, thou veritable face and paternal countenance of God, eight and six hundred in number, whose first letter forms a sacred name, a surname, and a sign;" which Kopp explains by the letters {Greek <I>frh</I>} (= 608), representative of the Egyptian name of the sun. Comp. also the designation of the Roman emperors in book v, 16, and following.]</P>

<P>Be thou not uninitiate in my lore."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus he spoke; and great trembling seized on him<BR>
At what he heard. And then, within his mind<BR>
Having contrived each matter, he besought<BR>
185 The people and began with words like these:<BR>
"O men insatiate, smit with madness great,<BR>
Whatever things ye practiced they shall not<BR>
Escape God's notice; for he knows all things,<BR>
Immortal Saviour overseeing all,<BR>
190 Who bade me warn you, that ye perish not.<BR>
Be sober, cut off badness, do not fight<BR>
Perforce each other with blood-guilty heart,<BR>
Nor irrigate much land with human gore.<BR>
Revere, O mortals, the supremely great<BR>
195 And fearless heavenly Creator, God<BR>
Imperishable, whose dwelling is the sky;<BR>
And do ye all entreat him--he is kind--<BR>
For life of cities and of all the world,<BR>
And of four-footed beasts and flying fowls;<BR>

<P>A fearful cry. And suddenly for you<BR>
The air shall be disordered, and from heaven<BR>
205 The fury of the mighty God shall come<BR>
Upon you. And it certainly shall be<BR>
That the immortal Saviour against men<BR>
Will send wrath if ye do not placate God<BR>
And from this time repent; and nothing more<BR>
210 Fretful and evil lawlessly shall ye<BR>
One to another do, but let there be<BR>
A guarding of one's self by holy life."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when they heard him each turned up his nose,<BR>
Calling him mad, a frenzy-smitten man.<BR>
215 And then again did Noah sound this strain:<BR>
"O men exceeding wretched, base in heart,<BR>
Unstable, leaving modesty behind<BR>
And loving shamelessness, rapacious lords,<BR>
Fierce sinners, false, insatiate, mischievous,<BR>
220 In nothing true, stealthy adulterers,<BR>
Flippant in language, pouring forth foul words,<BR>
The wrath of God most high not fearing, kept<BR>
To the fifth generation to atone!<BR>
In no way do ye wail, harsh men, but laugh;<BR>

235 For, if this water bidden of God shall come,<BR>
Earth shall float, hills float, and even sky shall float;<BR>
Everything shall be water, and all things<BR>
Shall be destroyed by waters. And the winds<BR>

240 O Phrygia, thou shalt from the water's crest<BR>
First rise up, and thou first another race<BR>
Of men shalt nourish, once again anew<BR>
Beginning; and thou shalt be nurse for all."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when now to the lawless generation<BR>
245 He had thus vainly spoken, the Most High<BR>
Appeared, and once more cried aloud and said:<BR>
"The time is now come, Noah, to proclaim<BR>
Each thing, even all which I that day to thee<BR>
Did promise and confirm, and to complete,<BR>
250 Because of a people disobedient,<BR>
Throughout the boundless world even all the things<BR>
Which generations of a former time<BR>
Did practice, evil things innumerable.<BR>
But do thou quickly enter with thy sons<BR>
255 And the wives. Call as many as I bid,<BR>
Of tribes of beasts and creeping things and birds,<BR>
And in as many as I ordain for life<BR>
Will I then put a willingness to go."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus spoke he; forth went (Noah) and aloud<BR>
260 Cried out and called. And then wife, sons and brides,<BR>
Entered the house of wood; then also went</P>

Forthwith the purpose of the God of heaven.<BR>
And he massed clouds, and bid the sun's bright disk,<BR>
And moon, and stars, and circle of the heaven,<BR>

And all the winds together were aroused,<BR>
And all the veins of water were unloosed<BR>

And from earth's caverns and the tireless deep<BR>

Illimitable earth was covered o'er.<BR>
But on the water swam that wondrous house;<BR>
And torn by many furious waves, and struck<BR>
By force of winds, it rushed on fearfully;<BR>
280 But with its keel it cut the mass of foam<BR>
While the loud-babbling waters dashed around.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when God deluged all the world with rains<BR>
Then also Noah took thought to observe<BR>
By counsels of the Immortal; for he now<BR>
285 Had&nbsp;had enough of Nereus. And straightway<BR>

Since it was weary wetting all the world<BR>
Many days; parting, then, it brought to light<BR>
295 How pale and blood-red was the mighty sky<BR>
And sun's bright disk awearied; scarcely held<BR>
Noah his courage. And then forth afar<BR>
Sent he a dove alone, that he might learn<BR>
If yet firm land appeared. But with tired wing,<BR>
300 Flying round all things, she again returned;<BR>
For not yet had the water ebbed away;<BR>
For it was deeply filling every place.<BR>
But after resting quietly for days<BR>
He sent the dove once more, to learn if yet<BR>
305 Had ceased the many waters. And she flew<BR>
And flew on, and went o'er the earth and, resting<BR>
Her body lightly on the humid ground,<BR>
Again to Noah back she came and bore<BR>
An olive branch--of tidings a great sign.<BR>

Because they hoped to look upon the land.<BR>
But then thereafter yet another bird,<BR>
Of black wing, sent he forth as hastily;<BR>
Which, trusting to its wings, flow willingly,<BR>

And Noah knew the land was nearer now.<BR>

From death, and there was great desire of heart;<BR>

Increasing, multiplying, rendering justice<BR>

Noah, encouraged, hastened on the land,<BR>
And with him went his sons and wife and brides,<BR>
And creeping things, and birds and quadrupeds,<BR>
