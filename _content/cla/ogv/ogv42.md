### 31. . . . that these unfortunates Seek afar the goodness whose source within they bear.

The source of all goodness is wisdom, and wisdom begins with the
knowledge of oneself. Without this knowledge, one aspires in vain to
real goodness. But how is it obtainable? If you interrogate Plato upon
this important point, he will respond to you, that it is in going back
to the essence of things—that is to say, in considering that which
constitutes man in himself. "A workman, you will say to this
philosopher, is not the same thing as the instrument which he uses; the
one who plays the lyre differs from the lyre upon which he plays. You
will readily agree to this, and the philosopher, pursuing his reasoning,
will add: And the eyes with which this musician reads his music, and the
hands with which he holds his lyre, are they not also instruments? Can
you deny, if the eyes, if the hands are instruments, that the whole body
may likewise be an instrument, different from the being who makes use of
it and who commands?" Unquestionably no, and you will comprehend
sufficiently that this being, by which man is really man, is the soul,
the knowledge of which you ought to seek. "For, "Plato will also tell
you, "he who knows his body, only knows that it is his, and is not
himself. To know his body as a physician or as a sculptor, is an art, to
know his soul, as a sage, is a science and the greatest of all
sciences." <span id="fr_626"></span>[b](#fn_625)

From the knowledge of himself man passes to that of God; and it is in
fixing this model of all perfection that he succeeds in delivering
himself from the evils which he has attracted by his own choice. <span
id="fr_627"></span>[c](#fn_626) His deliverance depends,

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

according to Pythagoras, upon virtue and upon truth. <span
id="fr_628"></span>[a](ogv43.htm#fn_627) The virtue, that he acquires by
purification, tempers and directs the passions; the truth, which he
attains by his union with the Being of beings, dissipates the darkness
with which his intelligence is obsessed; and both of them, acting
jointly in him, give him the divine form, according as he is disposed to
receive it, and guide him to supreme felicity. <span
id="fr_629"></span>[b](ogv43.htm#fn_628) But how difficult to obtain
this desired goal!
