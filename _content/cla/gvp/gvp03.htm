<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE GOLDEN VERSES OF PYTHAGORAS</H1>
<P>1. First worship the Immortal Gods, as they are established and ordained by the Law.</P>
<P>2. Reverence the Oath, and next the Heroes, full of goodness and light.</P>
<P>3. Honour likewise the Terrestrial D&aelig;mons by rendering them the worship lawfully due to them.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_2"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 2</FONT></A></P>
<P>4. Honour likewise thy parents, and those most nearly related to thee.</P>
<P>5. Of all the rest of mankind, make him thy friend who distinguishes himself by his virtue.</P>
<P>6. Always give ear to his mild exhortations, and take example from his virtuous and useful actions.</P>
<P>7. Avoid as much as possible hating thy friend for a slight fault.</P>
<P>8. [And understand that] power is a near neighbour to necessity.</P>
<P>9. Know that all these things are as I have told thee; and accustom thyself to overcome and vanquish these passions:--</P>
<P>10. First gluttony, sloth, sensuality, and anger.</P>
<P>11. Do nothing evil, neither in the presence of others, nor privately;</P>
<P>12. But above all things respect thyself.</P>
<P>13. In the next place, observe justice in thy actions and in thy words.</P>
<P>14. And accustom not thyself to behave thyself in any thing without rule, and without reason.</P>
<P>15. But always make this reflection, that it is ordained by destiny that all men shall die.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_3"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 3</FONT></A></P>
<P>16. And that the goods of fortune are uncertain; and that as they may be acquired, so may they likewise be lost.</P>
<P>17. Concerning all the calamities that men suffer by divine fortune,</P>
<P>18. Support with patience thy lot, be it what it may, and never repine at it.</P>
<P>19. But endeavour what thou canst to remedy it.</P>
<P>20. And consider that fate does not send the greatest portion of these misfortunes to good men.</P>
<P>21. There are among men many sorts of reasonings, good and bad;</P>
<P>22. Admire them not too easily, nor reject them.</P>
<P>23. But if falsehoods be advanced, hear them with mildness, and arm thyself with patience.</P>
<P>24. Observe well, on every occasion, what I am going to tell thee:--</P>
<P>25. Let no man either by his words, or by his deeds, ever seduce thee.</P>
<P>26. Nor entice thee to say or to do what is not profitable for thyself.</P>
<P>27. Consult and deliberate before thou act, that thou mayest not commit foolish actions.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_4"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 4</FONT></A></P>
<P>28. For it is the part of a miserable man to speak and to act without reflection.</P>
<P>29. But do that which will not afflict thee afterwards, nor oblige thee to repentance.</P>
<P>30. Never do anything which thou dost not understand.</P>
<P>31. But learn all thou ought'st to know, and by that means thou wilt lead a very pleasant life.</P>
<P>32. in no wise neglect the health of thy body;</P>
<P>33. But give it drink and meat in due measure, and also the exercise of which it has need.</P>
<P>34. Now by measure I mean what will not incommode thee.</P>
<P>35. Accustom thyself to a way of living that is neat and decent without luxury.</P>
<P>36. Avoid all things that will occasion envy.</P>
<P>37. And be not prodigal out of season, like one who knows not what is decent and honourable.</P>
<P>38. Neither be covetous nor niggardly; a due measure is excellent in these things.</P>
<P>39. Do only the things that cannot hurt thee, and deliberate before thou dost them.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_5"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 5</FONT></A></P>
<P>40. Never suffer sleep to close thy eyelids, after thy going to bed,</P>
<P>41. Till thou hast examined by thy reason all thy actions of the day.</P>
<P>42. Wherein have I done amiss? What have I done? What have I omitted that I ought to have done?</P>
<P>43. If in this examination thou find that thou hast done amiss, reprimand thyself severely for it;</P>
<P>44. And if thou hast done any good, rejoice.</P>
<P>45. Practise thoroughly all these things; meditate on them well; thou oughtest to love them with all thy heart.</P>
<P>46. 'Tis they that will put thee in the way of divine virtue.</P>
<P>47. I swear it by him who has transmitted into our souls the Sacred Quaternion, the source of nature, whose cause is eternal.</P>
<P>48. But never begin to set thy hand to any work, till thou hast first prayed the gods to accomplish what thou art going to begin.</P>
<P>49. When thou hast made this habit familiar to thee,</P>
<P>50. Thou wilt know the constitution of the Immortal Gods and of men.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_6"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 6</FONT></A></P>
<P>51. Even how far the different beings extend, and what contains and binds them together.</P>
<P>52. Thou shalt likewise know that according to Law, the nature of this universe is in all things alike,</P>
<P>53. So that thou shalt not hope what thou ought'st not to hope; and nothing in this world shall be hid from thee.</P>
<P>54. Thou wilt likewise know, that men draw upon themselves their own misfortunes voluntarily, and of their own free choice.</P>
<P>55. Unhappy that they are! They neither see nor understand that their good is near them.</P>
<P>56. Few know how to deliver themselves out of their misfortunes.</P>
<P>57. Such is the fate that blinds mankind, and takes away his senses.</P>
<P>58. Like huge cylinders they roll to and fro, and always oppressed with ills innumerable.</P>
<P>59. For fatal strife, innate, pursues them everywhere, tossing them up and down; nor do they perceive it.</P>
<P>60. Instead of provoking and stirring it up, they ought, by yielding, to avoid it.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_7"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 7</FONT></A></P>
<P>61. Oh! Jupiter, our Father! if Thou would'st deliver men from all the evils that oppress them,</P>
<P>62. Show them of what d&aelig;mon they make use.</P>
<P>63. But take courage; the race of man is divine.</P>
<P>64. Sacred nature reveals to them the most hidden mysteries.</P>
<P>65. If she impart to thee her secrets, thou wilt easily perform all the things which I have ordained thee.</P>
<P>66. And by the healing of thy soul, thou wilt deliver it from all evils, from all afflictions.</P>
<P>67. But abstain thou from the meats, which we have forbidden in the purifications and in the deliverance of the soul;</P>
<P>68. Make a just distinction of them, and examine all things well.</P>
<P>69. Leaving thyself always to be guided and directed by the understanding that comes from above, and that ought to hold the reins.</P>
<P>70. And when, after having divested thyself of thy mortal body, thou arrivest at the most pure &AElig;ther,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_8"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 8</FONT></A></P>
<P>71. Thou shalt be a God, immortal, incorruptible, and Death shall have no more dominion over thee.</P>
