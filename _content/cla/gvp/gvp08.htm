<P>6. Pythagoras said, it is requisite to choose the most excellent life; for custom will make it pleasant. Wealth is an infirm anchor, glory is still more infirm; and in a similar manner, the body, dominion, and honour. For all these are imbecile and powerless. What then are powerful anchors. Prudence, magnanimity, fortitude. These no tempest can shake. This is the Law of God, that virtue is the only thing that is strong; and that every thing else is a trifle.</P>
<P>7. All the parts of human life, in the same manner as those of a statue, ought to be beautiful.</P>
<P>8. Frankincense ought to be given to the Gods, but praise to good men.</P>
<P>9. It is requisite to defend those who are unjustly accused of having acted injuriously, but to praise those who excel in a certain good.</P>
<P>10. Neither will the horse be adjudged to be generous, that is sumptuously adorned, but the horse whose nature is illustrious; nor is the man worthy who possesses great wealth, but he whose soul is generous.</P>
<P>11. When the wise man opens his mouth, the beauties of his soul present themselves</P>
<P><A NAME="page_47"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 47</FONT></A></P>
<P>to the view, like the statues in a temple</P>
<P>12. Remind yourself that all men assert that wisdom is the greatest good, but that there are few who strenuously endeavour to obtain this greatest good.</P>
<P>13. Be sober, and remember to be disposed to believe; for these are the nerves of wisdom.</P>
<P>14. It is better to live lying on the grass, confiding in Divinity and yourself, than to lie on a golden bed with perturbation.</P>
<P>15. You will not be in want of anything, which it is in the power of fortune to give and take away.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
<P>16. Despise all those things which when liberated from the body you will not want; invoke the Gods to become your helpers.</P>
<P>17. Neither is it possible to conceal fire in a garment, nor a base deviation from rectitude in time.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_48"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 48</FONT></A></P>
<P>20. Those things which the body necessarily requires, are easily to be procured by all men, without labour and molestation; but those things to the attainment of which labour and molestation are requisite, are objects of desire, not to the body, but to depraved opinion.</P>
<P>21. Of desire also, he (Pythagoras) said as follows:--This passion is various, laborious, and very multiform. Of desires, however, some are acquired and adventitious, but others are connascent. But he defined desire itself to be a certain tendency and impulse of the soul, and an appetite of a plentitude or presence of sense, or an emptiness and absence of it, and of non-perception. He also said, that there are three most known species of erroneous and depraved desire, viz., the indecorous, the incommensurate, and the unseasonable. For desire is either immediately Indecorous, troublesome, and illiberal, or it is not absolutely so, but is more vehement and lasting than is fit. Or in the third place, it is impelled when it is not proper, and to objects to which it ought not to tend.</P>
<P>22. Endeavour not to conceal your errors</P>
<P><A NAME="page_49"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 49</FONT></A></P>
<P>by words, but to remedy them by reproof.</P>
<P>23. It is not so difficult to err, as not to reprove him who errs.</P>
<P>24. As a bodily disease cannot be healed, if it be concealed, or praised, thus also, neither can a remedy be applied to a diseased soul, which is badly guarded and protected.</P>

<P>27. Neither is the sun to be taken from the world nor freedom of speech from erudition.</P>
<P>28. As it is possible for one who is clothed with a sordid robe, to have a good habit of body; thus also he whose life is poor may possess freedom of speech.</P>
<P>29. Be rather delighted with those that reprove, than with those that flatter you; but avoid flatterers, as worse than enemies.</P>
<P>30. The life of the avaricious resembles a funeral banquet. For though it has all things requisite to a feast, yet no one present rejoices.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_50"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 50</FONT></A></P>
<P>31. Acquire continence as the greatest strength and wealth.</P>
<P>32. "Not frequently man from man," is one of the exhortations of Pythagoras; by which he obscurely signifies, that it is not proper to be frequently engaged in venereal connexions.</P>

<P>34. Pythagoras said, that intoxication is the meditation of insanity.</P>

<P>36. Pythagoras said, that it was requisite either to be silent, or to say something better than silence.</P>
<P>37. Let it be more eligible to you to throw a stone in vain, than to utter an idle word.</P>
<P>38. Do not say a few things in many words, but much in a few words.</P>
<P>39. Genius is to men either a good or an evil d&aelig;mon.</P>

<P>42. To the wise man every land is eligible as a place of residence; for the whole world is the country of the worthy soul.</P>
<P>43. Pythagoras said that luxury entered into cities in the first place, afterwards satiety, then lascivious insolence, and after all these, destruction.</P>
<P>44. Pythagoras said, that of cities that was the best which contained most worthy men.</P>

<P>53. Nor will I be silent as to this particular, that it appeared both to Plato and Pythagoras, that old age was not to be considered with reference to an egress from the present life, but to the beginning of a blessed life.</P>
<P>54. The ancient theologists and priests testify that the soul is conjoined to the body through a certain punishment, and, that it is buried in this body as in a sepulchre.</P>
