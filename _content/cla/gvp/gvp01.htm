<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">PREFACE</H1>
<P>IN this small volume an attempt has been made to gather together the best and most reliable of the sets of Ethical Verses attributed to the Pythagoreans.</P>
<P>Both Hall's translation from the Greek (1657), and Rowe's translation from the French of Andr&eacute; Dacier (1707), have been used in reproducing the Golden Verses of Pythagoras, but Dacier's version has been almost exclusively followed, being clearer and more intelligible.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_vi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. vi</FONT></A></P>
<P>The Golden Sentences of Democrates, the Similitudes of Demophilus, and Pythagorean Symbols are from Bridgman's translation, and are to be found in his little book, <I>Translations from the Greek</I>, published in 1804. The Pythagorean Sentences of Demophilus, translated by Taylor, are contained in that volume also.</P>
<P>The remaining sets of verses, translated by Taylor, are appended by him to his <I>Iamblichus' Life of Pythagoras</I>, published in 1818.</P>
