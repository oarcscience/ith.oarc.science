This essay, published in 1820, was an attempt to prove that
modern Freemasonry derived from ancient Greek philosophical and religious
ideas.
Hippolyto da Costa (1774-1823), was a Brazilian journalist,
author, Freemason and world traveller.
He was imprisoned for being a Freemason by the Inquisition
in Portugal in 1802; he escaped in 1805.
He settled in London and wrote a two volume book about his experiences,
<CITE>Narrativa da Persegui&ccedil;&atilde;o</CITE>, in 1811.
He went on to start the first Brazilian periodical,
the <CITE>Correio Braziliense</CITE>
or <CITE>Armaz&eacute;m Liter&aacute;rio</CITE>,
(1808-23), for which he is known today as "the founder of the Brazilian Press".

The original is extremely rare and was scanned
from a reprint by the Philosophical Research Society Press dated 1936,
which notes that it was "made possible through the courtesy of the Masonic
Grand Lodge Library at Cedar Rapids, Iowa".
