*The Discourses of Epictetus*, tr. by P.E Matheson, \[1916\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Discourses.

### Book I Notes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[1-1](dep002.htm#fr_0) This technical Stoic word,
as Matheson points out, includes 'the power of presenting an image to
the mind's eye' and 'the image so presented'. It is almost the
equivalent of 'the data of consciousness'.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[1-2](dep002.htm#fr_1) These words frequently
recur in Epictetus.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[1-3](dep003.htm#fr_2) Primary notions. 'They are
certain general terms used commonly by men (such as good, happiness,
justice), and their proper application not being reasoned out by the
individual before he uses them, they are in a sense anticipations of
reasoned knowledge.' (Matheson)

<span id="fn_3"></span>[1-4](dep003.htm#fr_3) The Greek says, 'to hold
the pot'.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[1-5](dep003.htm#fr_4) The interruption here of
one of the listeners is perfectly typical of the informal character of
the Discourses.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[1-6](dep005.htm#fr_5) This is a technical Stoic
term.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[1-7](dep005.htm#fr_6) This is a summary of the
three spheres of man's activity, according to the Stoics: (a) The will
to get and will to avoid; (b) impulse positive and negative; (c) assent.
(Matheson)

<span id="fn_7"></span>[1-8](dep008.htm#fr_7) 'A premiss is said to
"vary" when it becomes untrue at some subsequent time.' (Matheson)

<span id="fn_8"></span>[1-9](dep014.htm#fr_8) 'τὸ βάραθρον. The ravine
at Athens into which the corpses of criminals were thrown: hence used
metaphorically of the extreme of misery or degradation.' (Matheson)

<span id="fn_9"></span>[1-10](dep015.htm#fr_9) Epictetus uses Zeus
'interchangeably with "God" and "the divine", to express the Divine
Spirit of the universe.' (Matheson)

<span id="fn_10"></span>[1-11](dep015.htm#fr_10) Sometimes this is
rendered literally by the word 'daemon' and it connoted to the Stoic the
higher element within man, his reason.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[1-12](dep016.htm#fr_11) This is 'the governing
principle of the soul, and as the highest aspect of the soul is
rational, it is often equivalent to διάνοια and λογισμός, but must not
be regarded as purely intellectual: it is the soul as feeling and
willing, as well as thinking.' (Matheson)

<span id="fn_12"></span>[1-13](dep023.htm#fr_12) Cf. above, note 3.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[1-14](dep025.htm#fr_13) 'Epictetus, lecturing
at Nicopolis in Epirus, speaks of sending his pupil to Rome to spy out
the land, to see how things are going in the capital under Domitian, who
had expelled all philosophers.' (Matheson)

<span id="fn_14"></span>[1-15](dep029.htm#fr_14) Medea.
