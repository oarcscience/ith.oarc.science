<SMALL><i>Cleanse your own heart, cast out from your mind, ... pain, fear,
desire, envy, ill will, avarice, cowardice, passion uncontrolled.
These things you cannot cast out, unless you look to God alone,
on Him alone set your thoughts, and consecrate yourself to His commands.</i>
--(bk. II, ch. xvii, p. 316)</SMALL>

<P>
Epictetus was a Greek Stoic philosopher (b. 55-d. 135 CE).
Born a slave in Hierapolis, Phyrgia, in what is today Turkey, Epictetus
lived in Rome until exiled to Nicopolis in Northern Greece.
It was in exile that Epictetus' disciple Arrian took down his
<CITE>Discourses</CITE>.
As we have no actual writings of Epictetus, Arrian's notes are the
only remnants of his philosophy.
</P>
<P>
This edition includes the <CITE>Discourses</CITE>, and two minor works,
the <CITE>Fragments</CITE>, and the <CITE>Manual</CITE>, also known as
the <CITE>Enchiridion</CITE>.--J.B. Hare, June 13th, 2009.
