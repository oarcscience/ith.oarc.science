### CHAPTER XVII

#### CONCERNING PROVIDENCE

<span class="smallcaps">When</span> you accuse Providence, only consider
the matter, and you will understand that its action is according to
reason.

'But the unjust man', you say, 'is better off.'

In what? In money: for in regard to this he has the advantage over you,
because he flatters, is shameless, is vigilant. Is this surprising? But

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

look whether he is better off than you in being trustworthy and
self-respecting. You will find that he is not; where you are superior to
him, you will find that you are better off. So when some one was
indignant once at the prosperity of Philostorgos, I said, 'Would you be
willing to share the bed of Suras?' 'May that day never come!' he said.
'Why then are you indignant at his getting a return for what he sells,
or how do you come to count him blessed who gets what he has by means
that you abhor? Or what is the harm in Providence giving the better lot
to those who are better? Is it not better to be self-respecting than to
be rich?'

He agreed.

Man, why are you indignant then at having the better lot? Therefore
always remember the truth and be ready to apply it—that it is a law of
nature for the better to have the advantage of the worse in that in
which he is better, and then you will never be indignant.

'But my wife uses me ill.'

Very well: if any one asks you, 'What is the matter?' say, 'My wife uses
me ill.'

'Nothing else?'

Nothing.

'My father gives me nothing' ... but need you go further in your own
mind and add this lie, that poverty is evil? For this reason it is not
poverty that we must cast out, but our judgement about poverty, and so
we shall be at peace.
