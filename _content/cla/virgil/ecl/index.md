# THE ECLOGUES OF VIRGIL

### Translated by J. W. MacKail

#### \[1934\]

The Eclogues ('Selections'), also know as the Bucolics, were Virgils'
first major work. These ten poems were written between 42 and 39 B.C.E.
At this time Virgil was in his thirties. These poems are in a particular
format, the pastoral, which the Sicilian poet Theocritus (ca. 280
B.C.E.) had developed in his Idyls. Virgil employs this format to
expound allegorical themes using the language of classical mythology,
much like the bardic poetry of the Druids. The fourth Eclogue stands out
from this series, in which Virgil makes some enigmatic prophecies,
similar to the [Pseudo-Sibylline Oracles](../../sib/index). During the
middle ages Virgil developed a reputation as a sorceror, and it is
possible that the esoteric meaning cloaked in this poem had something to
do with this.

This translation has been cross-linked at the chapter level to the
original Latin text, which was not included in the MacKail version.
