<P>The gates of heav'n unfold: Jove summons all<BR>
The gods to council in the common hall.<BR>
Sublimely seated, he surveys from far<BR>
The fields, the camp, the fortune of the war,<BR>
And all th' inferior world. From first to last,<BR>
The sov'reign senate in degrees are plac'd.</P>
<P>Then thus th' almighty sire began: "Ye gods,<BR>
Natives or denizens of blest abodes,<BR>
From whence these murmurs, and this change of mind,<BR>
This backward fate from what was first design'd?<BR>
Why this protracted war, when my commands<BR>
Pronounc'd a peace, and gave the Latian lands?<BR>
What fear or hope on either part divides<BR>
Our heav'ns, and arms our powers on diff'rent sides?<BR>
A lawful time of war at length will come,<BR>
(Nor need your haste anticipate the doom),<BR>
When Carthage shall contend the world with Rome,<BR>
Shall force the rigid rocks and Alpine chains,<BR>
And, like a flood, come pouring on the plains.<BR>
Then is your time for faction and debate,<BR>
For partial favor, and permitted hate.<BR>
Let now your immature dissension cease;<BR>
Sit quiet, and compose your souls to peace."</P>
<P>Thus Jupiter in few unfolds the charge;<BR>
But lovely Venus thus replies at large:<BR>
"O pow'r immense, eternal energy,<BR>
(For to what else protection can we fly?)<BR>
Seest thou the proud Rutulians, how they dare<BR>
In fields, unpunish'd, and insult my care?<BR>
How lofty Turnus vaunts amidst his train,<BR>
In shining arms, triumphant on the plain?<BR>
Ev'n in their lines and trenches they contend,<BR>
And scarce their walls the Trojan troops defend:<BR>
The town is fill'd with slaughter, and o'erfloats,<BR>
With a red deluge, their increasing moats.<BR>
Aeneas, ignorant, and far from thence,<BR>
Has left a camp expos'd, without defense.<BR>
This endless outrage shall they still sustain?<BR>
Shall Troy renew'd be forc'd and fir'd again?<BR>
A second siege my banish'd issue fears,<BR>
And a new Diomede in arms appears.<BR>
One more audacious mortal will be found;<BR>
And I, thy daughter, wait another wound.<BR>
Yet, if with fates averse, without thy leave,<BR>
The Latian lands my progeny receive,<BR>
Bear they the pains of violated law,<BR>
And thy protection from their aid withdraw.<BR>
But, if the gods their sure success foretell;<BR>
If those of heav'n consent with those of hell,<BR>
To promise Italy; who dare debate<BR>
The pow'r of Jove, or fix another fate?<BR>
What should I tell of tempests on the main,<BR>
Of Aeolus usurping Neptune's reign?<BR>
Of Iris sent, with Bacchanalian heat<BR>
T' inspire the matrons, and destroy the fleet?<BR>
Now Juno to the Stygian sky descends,<BR>
Solicits hell for aid, and arms the fiends.<BR>
That new example wanted yet above:<BR>
An act that well became the wife of Jove!<BR>
Alecto, rais'd by her, with rage inflames<BR>
The peaceful bosoms of the Latian dames.<BR>
Imperial sway no more exalts my mind;<BR>
(Such hopes I had indeed, while Heav'n was kind;)<BR>
Now let my happier foes possess my place,<BR>
Whom Jove prefers before the Trojan race;<BR>
And conquer they, whom you with conquest grace.<BR>
Since you can spare, from all your wide command,<BR>
No spot of earth, no hospitable land,<BR>
Which may my wand'ring fugitives receive;<BR>
(Since haughty Juno will not give you leave;)<BR>
Then, father, (if I still may use that name,)<BR>
By ruin'd Troy, yet smoking from the flame,<BR>
I beg you, let Ascanius, by my care,<BR>
Be freed from danger, and dismiss'd the war:<BR>
Inglorious let him live, without a crown.<BR>
The father may be cast on coasts unknown,<BR>
Struggling with fate; but let me save the son.<BR>
Mine is Cythera, mine the Cyprian tow'rs:<BR>
In those recesses, and those sacred bow'rs,<BR>
Obscurely let him rest; his right resign<BR>
To promis'd empire, and his Julian line.<BR>
Then Carthage may th' Ausonian towns destroy,<BR>
Nor fear the race of a rejected boy.<BR>
What profits it my son to scape the fire,<BR>
Arm'd with his gods, and loaded with his sire;<BR>
To pass the perils of the seas and wind;<BR>
Evade the Greeks, and leave the war behind;<BR>
To reach th' Italian shores; if, after all,<BR>
Our second Pergamus is doom'd to fall?<BR>
Much better had he curb'd his high desires,<BR>
And hover'd o'er his ill-extinguish'd fires.<BR>
To Simois' banks the fugitives restore,<BR>
And give them back to war, and all the woes before."</P>
<P>Deep indignation swell'd Saturnia's heart:<BR>
"And must I own," she said, "my secret smart-<BR>
What with more decence were in silence kept,<BR>
And, but for this unjust reproach, had slept?<BR>
Did god or man your fav'rite son advise,<BR>
With war unhop'd the Latians to surprise?<BR>
By fate, you boast, and by the gods' decree,<BR>
He left his native land for Italy!<BR>
Confess the truth; by mad Cassandra, more<BR>
Than Heav'n inspir'd, he sought a foreign shore!<BR>
Did I persuade to trust his second Troy<BR>
To the raw conduct of a beardless boy,<BR>
With walls unfinish'd, which himself forsakes,<BR>
And thro' the waves a wand'ring voyage takes?<BR>
When have I urg'd him meanly to demand<BR>
The Tuscan aid, and arm a quiet land?<BR>
Did I or Iris give this mad advice,<BR>
Or made the fool himself the fatal choice?<BR>
You think it hard, the Latians should destroy<BR>
With swords your Trojans, and with fires your Troy!<BR>
Hard and unjust indeed, for men to draw<BR>
Their native air, nor take a foreign law!<BR>
That Turnus is permitted still to live,<BR>
To whom his birth a god and goddess give!<BR>
But yet is just and lawful for your line<BR>
To drive their fields, and force with fraud to join;<BR>
Realms, not your own, among your clans divide,<BR>
And from the bridegroom tear the promis'd bride;<BR>
Petition, while you public arms prepare;<BR>
Pretend a peace, and yet provoke a war!<BR>
'T was giv'n to you, your darling son to shroud,<BR>
To draw the dastard from the fighting crowd,<BR>
And, for a man, obtend an empty cloud.<BR>
From flaming fleets you turn'd the fire away,<BR>
And chang'd the ships to daughters of the sea.<BR>
But is my crime- the Queen of Heav'n offends,<BR>
If she presume to save her suff'ring friends!<BR>
Your son, not knowing what his foes decree,<BR>
You say, is absent: absent let him be.<BR>
Yours is Cythera, yours the Cyprian tow'rs,<BR>
The soft recesses, and the sacred bow'rs.<BR>
Why do you then these needless arms prepare,<BR>
And thus provoke a people prone to war?<BR>
Did I with fire the Trojan town deface,<BR>
Or hinder from return your exil'd race?<BR>
Was I the cause of mischief, or the man<BR>
Whose lawless lust the fatal war began?<BR>
Think on whose faith th' adult'rous youth relied;<BR>
Who promis'd, who procur'd, the Spartan bride?<BR>
When all th' united states of Greece combin'd,<BR>
To purge the world of the perfidious kind,<BR>
Then was your time to fear the Trojan fate:<BR>
Your quarrels and complaints are now too late."</P>
<P>Thus Juno. Murmurs rise, with mix'd applause,<BR>
Just as they favor or dislike the cause.<BR>
So winds, when yet unfledg'd in woods they lie,<BR>
In whispers first their tender voices try,<BR>
Then issue on the main with bellowing rage,<BR>
And storms to trembling mariners presage.</P>
<P>Then thus to both replied th' imperial god,<BR>
Who shakes heav'n's axles with his awful nod.<BR>
(When he begins, the silent senate stand<BR>
With rev'rence, list'ning to the dread command:<BR>
The clouds dispel; the winds their breath restrain;<BR>
And the hush'd waves lie flatted on the main.)<BR>
"Celestials, your attentive ears incline!<BR>
Since," said the god, "the Trojans must not join<BR>
In wish'd alliance with the Latian line;<BR>
Since endless jarrings and immortal hate<BR>
Tend but to discompose our happy state;<BR>
The war henceforward be resign'd to fate:<BR>
Each to his proper fortune stand or fall;<BR>
Equal and unconcern'd I look on all.<BR>
Rutulians, Trojans, are the same to me;<BR>
And both shall draw the lots their fates decree.<BR>
Let these assault, if Fortune be their friend;<BR>
And, if she favors those, let those defend:<BR>
The Fates will find their way." The Thund'rer said,<BR>
And shook the sacred honors of his head,<BR>
Attesting Styx, th' inviolable flood,<BR>
And the black regions of his brother god.<BR>
Trembled the poles of heav'n, and earth confess'd the nod.<BR>
This end the sessions had: the senate rise,<BR>
And to his palace wait their sov'reign thro' the skies.</P>
<P>Meantime, intent upon their siege, the foes<BR>
Within their walls the Trojan host inclose:<BR>
They wound, they kill, they watch at ev'ry gate;<BR>
Renew the fires, and urge their happy fate.</P>
<P>Th' Aeneans wish in vain their wanted chief,<BR>
Hopeless of flight, more hopeless of relief.<BR>
Thin on the tow'rs they stand; and ev'n those few<BR>
A feeble, fainting, and dejected crew.<BR>
Yet in the face of danger some there stood:<BR>
The two bold brothers of Sarpedon's blood,<BR>
Asius and Acmon; both th' Assaraci;<BR>
Young Haemon, and tho' young, resolv'd to die.<BR>
With these were Clarus and Thymoetes join'd;<BR>
Tibris and Castor, both of Lycian kind.<BR>
From Acmon's hands a rolling stone there came,<BR>
So large, it half deserv'd a mountain's name:<BR>
Strong-sinew'd was the youth, and big of bone;<BR>
His brother Mnestheus could not more have done,<BR>
Or the great father of th' intrepid son.<BR>
Some firebrands throw, some flights of arrows send;<BR>
And some with darts, and some with stones defend.</P>
<P>Amid the press appears the beauteous boy,<BR>
The care of Venus, and the hope of Troy.<BR>
His lovely face unarm'd, his head was bare;<BR>
In ringlets o'er his shoulders hung his hair.<BR>
His forehead circled with a diadem;<BR>
Distinguish'd from the crowd, he shines a gem,<BR>
Enchas'd in gold, or polish'd iv'ry set,<BR>
Amidst the meaner foil of sable jet.</P>
<P>Nor Ismarus was wanting to the war,<BR>
Directing pointed arrows from afar,<BR>
And death with poison arm'd- in Lydia born,<BR>
Where plenteous harvests the fat fields adorn;<BR>
Where proud Pactolus floats the fruitful lands,<BR>
And leaves a rich manure of golden sands.<BR>
There Capys, author of the Capuan name,<BR>
And there was Mnestheus too, increas'd in fame,<BR>
Since Turnus from the camp he cast with shame.</P>
<P>Thus mortal war was wag'd on either side.<BR>
Meantime the hero cuts the nightly tide:<BR>
For, anxious, from Evander when he went,<BR>
He sought the Tyrrhene camp, and Tarchon's tent;<BR>
Expos'd the cause of coming to the chief;<BR>
His name and country told, and ask'd relief;<BR>
Propos'd the terms; his own small strength declar'd;<BR>
What vengeance proud Mezentius had prepar'd:<BR>
What Turnus, bold and violent, design'd;<BR>
Then shew'd the slipp'ry state of humankind,<BR>
And fickle fortune; warn'd him to beware,<BR>
And to his wholesome counsel added pray'r.<BR>
Tarchon, without delay, the treaty signs,<BR>
And to the Trojan troops the Tuscan joins.</P>
<P>They soon set sail; nor now the fates withstand;<BR>
Their forces trusted with a foreign hand.<BR>
Aeneas leads; upon his stern appear<BR>
Two lions carv'd, which rising Ida bear-<BR>
Ida, to wand'ring Trojans ever dear.<BR>
Under their grateful shade Aeneas sate,<BR>
Revolving war's events, and various fate.<BR>
His left young Pallas kept, fix'd to his side,<BR>
And oft of winds enquir'd, and of the tide;<BR>
Oft of the stars, and of their wat'ry way;<BR>
And what he suffer'd both by land and sea.</P>
<P>Now, sacred sisters, open all your spring!<BR>
The Tuscan leaders, and their army sing,<BR>
Which follow'd great Aeneas to the war:<BR>
Their arms, their numbers, and their names declare.</P>
<P>A thousand youths brave Massicus obey,<BR>
Borne in the Tiger thro' the foaming sea;<BR>
From Asium brought, and Cosa, by his care:<BR>
For arms, light quivers, bows and shafts, they bear.<BR>
Fierce Abas next: his men bright armor wore;<BR>
His stern Apollo's golden statue bore.<BR>
Six hundred Populonia sent along,<BR>
All skill'd in martial exercise, and strong.<BR>
Three hundred more for battle Ilva joins,<BR>
An isle renown'd for steel, and unexhausted mines.<BR>
Asylas on his prow the third appears,<BR>
Who heav'n interprets, and the wand'ring stars;<BR>
From offer'd entrails prodigies expounds,<BR>
And peals of thunder, with presaging sounds.<BR>
A thousand spears in warlike order stand,<BR>
Sent by the Pisans under his command.</P>
<P>Fair Astur follows in the wat'ry field,<BR>
Proud of his manag'd horse and painted shield.<BR>
Gravisca, noisome from the neighb'ring fen,<BR>
And his own Caere, sent three hundred men;<BR>
With those which Minio's fields and Pyrgi gave,<BR>
All bred in arms, unanimous, and brave.</P>
<P>Thou, Muse, the name of Cinyras renew,<BR>
And brave Cupavo follow'd but by few;<BR>
Whose helm confess'd the lineage of the man,<BR>
And bore, with wings display'd, a silver swan.<BR>
Love was the fault of his fam'd ancestry,<BR>
Whose forms and fortunes in his ensigns fly.<BR>
For Cycnus lov'd unhappy Phaeton,<BR>
And sung his loss in poplar groves, alone,<BR>
Beneath the sister shades, to soothe his grief.<BR>
Heav'n heard his song, and hasten'd his relief,<BR>
And chang'd to snowy plumes his hoary hair,<BR>
And wing'd his flight, to chant aloft in air.<BR>
His son Cupavo brush'd the briny flood:<BR>
Upon his stern a brawny Centaur stood,<BR>
Who heav'd a rock, and, threat'ning still to throw,<BR>
With lifted hands alarm'd the seas below:<BR>
They seem'd to fear the formidable sight,<BR>
And roll'd their billows on, to speed his flight.</P>
<P>Ocnus was next, who led his native train<BR>
Of hardy warriors thro' the wat'ry plain:<BR>
The son of Manto by the Tuscan stream,<BR>
From whence the Mantuan town derives the name-<BR>
An ancient city, but of mix'd descent:<BR>
Three sev'ral tribes compose the government;<BR>
Four towns are under each; but all obey<BR>
The Mantuan laws, and own the Tuscan sway.</P>
<P>Hate to Mezentius arm'd five hundred more,<BR>
Whom Mincius from his sire Benacus bore:<BR>
Mincius, with wreaths of reeds his forehead cover'd o'er.<BR>
These grave Auletes leads: a hundred sweep<BR>
With stretching oars at once the glassy deep.<BR>
Him and his martial train the Triton bears;<BR>
High on his poop the sea-green god appears:<BR>
Frowning he seems his crooked shell to sound,<BR>
And at the blast the billows dance around.<BR>
A hairy man above the waist he shows;<BR>
A porpoise tail beneath his belly grows;<BR>
And ends a fish: his breast the waves divides,<BR>
And froth and foam augment the murm'ring tides.</P>
<P>Full thirty ships transport the chosen train<BR>
For Troy's relief, and scour the briny main.</P>
<P>Now was the world forsaken by the sun,<BR>
And Phoebe half her nightly race had run.<BR>
The careful chief, who never clos'd his eyes,<BR>
Himself the rudder holds, the sails supplies.<BR>
A choir of Nereids meet him on the flood,<BR>
Once his own galleys, hewn from Ida's wood;<BR>
But now, as many nymphs, the sea they sweep,<BR>
As rode, before, tall vessels on the deep.<BR>
They know him from afar; and in a ring<BR>
Inclose the ship that bore the Trojan king.<BR>
Cymodoce, whose voice excell'd the rest,<BR>
Above the waves advanc'd her snowy breast;<BR>
Her right hand stops the stern; her left divides<BR>
The curling ocean, and corrects the tides.<BR>
She spoke for all the choir, and thus began<BR>
With pleasing words to warn th' unknowing man:<BR>
"Sleeps our lov'd lord? O goddess-born, awake!<BR>
Spread ev'ry sail, pursue your wat'ry track,<BR>
And haste your course. Your navy once were we,<BR>
From Ida's height descending to the sea;<BR>
Till Turnus, as at anchor fix'd we stood,<BR>
Presum'd to violate our holy wood.<BR>
Then, loos'd from shore, we fled his fires profane<BR>
(Unwillingly we broke our master's chain),<BR>
And since have sought you thro' the Tuscan main.<BR>
The mighty Mother chang'd our forms to these,<BR>
And gave us life immortal in the seas.<BR>
But young Ascanius, in his camp distress'd,<BR>
By your insulting foes is hardly press'd.<BR>
Th' Arcadian horsemen, and Etrurian host,<BR>
Advance in order on the Latian coast:<BR>
To cut their way the Daunian chief designs,<BR>
Before their troops can reach the Trojan lines.<BR>
Thou, when the rosy morn restores the light,<BR>
First arm thy soldiers for th' ensuing fight:<BR>
Thyself the fated sword of Vulcan wield,<BR>
And bear aloft th' impenetrable shield.<BR>
To-morrow's sun, unless my skill be vain,<BR>
Shall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain."<BR>
Parting, she spoke; and with immortal force<BR>
Push'd on the vessel in her wat'ry course;<BR>
For well she knew the way. Impell'd behind,<BR>
The ship flew forward, and outstripp'd the wind.<BR>
The rest make up. Unknowing of the cause,<BR>
The chief admires their speed, and happy omens draws.</P>
<P>Then thus he pray'd, and fix'd on heav'n his eyes:<BR>
"Hear thou, great Mother of the deities.<BR>
With turrets crown'd! (on Ida's holy hill<BR>
Fierce tigers, rein'd and curb'd, obey thy will.)<BR>
Firm thy own omens; lead us on to fight;<BR>
And let thy Phrygians conquer in thy right."</P>
<P>He said no more. And now renewing day<BR>
Had chas'd the shadows of the night away.<BR>
He charg'd the soldiers, with preventing care,<BR>
Their flags to follow, and their arms prepare;<BR>
Warn'd of th' ensuing fight, and bade 'em hope the war.<BR>
Now, his lofty poop, he view'd below<BR>
His camp incompass'd, and th' inclosing foe.<BR>
His blazing shield, imbrac'd, he held on high;<BR>
The camp receive the sign, and with loud shouts reply.<BR>
Hope arms their courage: from their tow'rs they throw<BR>
Their darts with double force, and drive the foe.<BR>
Thus, at the signal giv'n, the cranes arise<BR>
Before the stormy south, and blacken all the skies.</P>
<P>King Turnus wonder'd at the fight renew'd,<BR>
Till, looking back, the Trojan fleet he view'd,<BR>
The seas with swelling canvas cover'd o'er,<BR>
And the swift ships descending on the shore.<BR>
The Latians saw from far, with dazzled eyes,<BR>
The radiant crest that seem'd in flames to rise,<BR>
And dart diffusive fires around the field,<BR>
And the keen glitt'ring the golden shield.<BR>
Thus threat'ning comets, when by night they rise,<BR>
Shoot sanguine streams, and sadden all the skies:<BR>
So Sirius, flashing forth sinister lights,<BR>
Pale humankind with plagues and with dry famine fright:</P>
<P>Yet Turnus with undaunted mind is bent<BR>
To man the shores, and hinder their descent,<BR>
And thus awakes the courage of his friends:<BR>
"What you so long have wish'd, kind Fortune sends;<BR>
In ardent arms to meet th' invading foe:<BR>
You find, and find him at advantage now.<BR>
Yours is the day: you need but only dare;<BR>
Your swords will make you masters of the war.<BR>
Your sires, your sons, your houses, and your lands,<BR>
And dearest wifes, are all within your hands.<BR>
Be mindful of the race from whence you came,<BR>
And emulate in arms your fathers' fame.<BR>
Now take the time, while stagg'ring yet they stand<BR>
With feet unfirm, and prepossess the strand:<BR>
Fortune befriends the bold." Nor more he said,<BR>
But balanc'd whom to leave, and whom to lead;<BR>
Then these elects, the landing to prevent;<BR>
And those he leaves, to keep the city pent.</P>
<P>Meantime the Trojan sends his troops ashore:<BR>
Some are by boats expos'd, by bridges more.<BR>
With lab'ring oars they bear along the strand,<BR>
Where the tide languishes, and leap aland.<BR>
Tarchon observes the coast with careful eyes,<BR>
And, where no ford he finds, no water fries,<BR>
Nor billows with unequal murmurs roar,<BR>
But smoothly slide along, and swell the shore,<BR>
That course he steer'd, and thus he gave command:<BR>
"Here ply your oars, and at all hazard land:<BR>
Force on the vessel, that her keel may wound<BR>
This hated soil, and furrow hostile ground.<BR>
Let me securely land- I ask no more;<BR>
Then sink my ships, or shatter on the shore."</P>
<P>This fiery speech inflames his fearful friends:<BR>
They tug at ev'ry oar, and ev'ry stretcher bends;<BR>
They run their ships aground; the vessels knock,<BR>
(Thus forc'd ashore,) and tremble with the shock.<BR>
Tarchon's alone was lost, that stranded stood,<BR>
Stuck on a bank, and beaten by the flood:<BR>
She breaks her back; the loosen'd sides give way,<BR>
And plunge the Tuscan soldiers in the sea.<BR>
Their broken oars and floating planks withstand<BR>
Their passage, while they labor to the land,<BR>
And ebbing tides bear back upon th' uncertain sand.</P>
<P>Now Turnus leads his troops without delay,<BR>
Advancing to the margin of the sea.<BR>
The trumpets sound: Aeneas first assail'd<BR>
The clowns new-rais'd and raw, and soon prevail'd.<BR>
Great Theron fell, an omen of the fight;<BR>
Great Theron, large of limbs, of giant height.<BR>
He first in open field defied the prince:<BR>
But armor scal'd with gold was no defense<BR>
Against the fated sword, which open'd wide<BR>
His plated shield, and pierc'd his naked side.<BR>
Next, Lichas fell, who, not like others born,<BR>
Was from his wretched mother ripp'd and torn;<BR>
Sacred, O Phoebus, from his birth to thee;<BR>
For his beginning life from biting steel was free.<BR>
Not far from him was Gyas laid along,<BR>
Of monstrous bulk; with Cisseus fierce and strong:<BR>
Vain bulk and strength! for, when the chief assail'd,<BR>
Nor valor nor Herculean arms avail'd,<BR>
Nor their fam'd father, wont in war to go<BR>
With great Alcides, while he toil'd below.<BR>
The noisy Pharos next receiv'd his death:<BR>
Aeneas writh'd his dart, and stopp'd his bawling breath.<BR>
Then wretched Cydon had receiv'd his doom,<BR>
Who courted Clytius in his beardless bloom,<BR>
And sought with lust obscene polluted joys:<BR>
The Trojan sword had curd his love of boys,<BR>
Had not his sev'n bold brethren stopp'd the course<BR>
Of the fierce champions, with united force.<BR>
Sev'n darts were thrown at once; and some rebound<BR>
From his bright shield, some on his helmet sound:<BR>
The rest had reach'd him; but his mother's care<BR>
Prevented those, and turn'd aside in air.</P>
<P>The prince then call'd Achates, to supply<BR>
The spears that knew the way to victory-<BR>
"Those fatal weapons, which, inur'd to blood,<BR>
In Grecian bodies under Ilium stood:<BR>
Not one of those my hand shall toss in vain<BR>
Against our foes, on this contended plain."<BR>
He said; then seiz'd a mighty spear, and threw;<BR>
Which, wing'd with fate, thro' Maeon's buckler flew,<BR>
Pierc'd all the brazen plates, and reach'd his heart:<BR>
He stagger'd with intolerable smart.<BR>
Alcanor saw; and reach'd, but reach'd in vain,<BR>
His helping hand, his brother to sustain.<BR>
A second spear, which kept the former course,<BR>
From the same hand, and sent with equal force,<BR>
His right arm pierc'd, and holding on, bereft<BR>
His use of both, and pinion'd down his left.<BR>
Then Numitor from his dead brother drew<BR>
Th' ill-omen'd spear, and at the Trojan threw:<BR>
Preventing fate directs the lance awry,<BR>
Which, glancing, only mark'd Achates' thigh.</P>
<P>In pride of youth the Sabine Clausus came,<BR>
And, from afar, at Dryops took his aim.<BR>
The spear flew hissing thro' the middle space,<BR>
And pierc'd his throat, directed at his face;<BR>
It stopp'd at once the passage of his wind,<BR>
And the free soul to flitting air resign'd:<BR>
His forehead was the first that struck the ground;<BR>
Lifeblood and life rush'd mingled thro' the wound.<BR>
He slew three brothers of the Borean race,<BR>
And three, whom Ismarus, their native place,<BR>
Had sent to war, but all the sons of Thrace.<BR>
Halesus, next, the bold Aurunci leads:<BR>
The son of Neptune to his aid succeeds,<BR>
Conspicuous on his horse. On either hand,<BR>
These fight to keep, and those to win, the land.<BR>
With mutual blood th' Ausonian soil is dyed,<BR>
While on its borders each their claim decide.<BR>
As wintry winds, contending in the sky,<BR>
With equal force of lungs their titles try:<BR>
They rage, they roar; the doubtful rack of heav'n<BR>
Stands without motion, and the tide undriv'n:<BR>
Each bent to conquer, neither side to yield,<BR>
They long suspend the fortune of the field.<BR>
Both armies thus perform what courage can;<BR>
Foot set to foot, and mingled man to man.</P>
<P>But, in another part, th' Arcadian horse<BR>
With ill success ingage the Latin force:<BR>
For, where th' impetuous torrent, rushing down,<BR>
Huge craggy stones and rooted trees had thrown,<BR>
They left their coursers, and, unus'd to fight<BR>
On foot, were scatter'd in a shameful flight.<BR>
Pallas, who with disdain and grief had view'd<BR>
His foes pursuing, and his friends pursued,<BR>
Us'd threat'nings mix'd with pray'rs, his last resource,<BR>
With these to move their minds, with those to fire their force<BR>
"Which way, companions? whether would you run?<BR>
By you yourselves, and mighty battles won,<BR>
By my great sire, by his establish'd name,<BR>
And early promise of my future fame;<BR>
By my youth, emulous of equal right<BR>
To share his honors- shun ignoble flight!<BR>
Trust not your feet: your hands must hew way<BR>
Thro' yon black body, and that thick array:<BR>
'T is thro' that forward path that we must come;<BR>
There lies our way, and that our passage home.<BR>
Nor pow'rs above, nor destinies below<BR>
Oppress our arms: with equal strength we go,<BR>
With mortal hands to meet a mortal foe.<BR>
See on what foot we stand: a scanty shore,<BR>
The sea behind, our enemies before;<BR>
No passage left, unless we swim the main;<BR>
Or, forcing these, the Trojan trenches gain."<BR>
This said, he strode with eager haste along,<BR>
And bore amidst the thickest of the throng.<BR>
Lagus, the first he met, with fate to foe,<BR>
Had heav'd a stone of mighty weight, to throw:<BR>
Stooping, the spear descended on his chine,<BR>
Just where the bone distinguished either loin:<BR>
It stuck so fast, so deeply buried lay,<BR>
That scarce the victor forc'd the steel away.<BR>
Hisbon came on: but, while he mov'd too slow<BR>
To wish'd revenge, the prince prevents his blow;<BR>
For, warding his at once, at once he press'd,<BR>
And plung'd the fatal weapon in his breast.<BR>
Then lewd Anchemolus he laid in dust,<BR>
Who stain'd his stepdam's bed with impious lust.<BR>
And, after him, the Daucian twins were slain,<BR>
Laris and Thymbrus, on the Latian plain;<BR>
So wondrous like in feature, shape, and size,<BR>
As caus'd an error in their parents' eyes-<BR>
Grateful mistake! but soon the sword decides<BR>
The nice distinction, and their fate divides:<BR>
For Thymbrus' head was lopp'd; and Laris' hand,<BR>
Dismember'd, sought its owner on the strand:<BR>
The trembling fingers yet the fauchion strain,<BR>
And threaten still th' intended stroke in vain.</P>
<P>Now, to renew the charge, th' Arcadians came:<BR>
Sight of such acts, and sense of honest shame,<BR>
And grief, with anger mix'd, their minds inflame.<BR>
Then, with a casual blow was Rhoeteus slain,<BR>
Who chanc'd, as Pallas threw, to cross the plain:<BR>
The flying spear was after Ilus sent;<BR>
But Rhoeteus happen'd on a death unmeant:<BR>
From Teuthras and from Tyres while he fled,<BR>
The lance, athwart his body, laid him dead:<BR>
Roll'd from his chariot with a mortal wound,<BR>
And intercepted fate, he spurn'd the ground.<BR>
As when, in summer, welcome winds arise,<BR>
The watchful shepherd to the forest flies,<BR>
And fires the midmost plants; contagion spreads,<BR>
And catching flames infect the neighb'ring heads;<BR>
Around the forest flies the furious blast,<BR>
And all the leafy nation sinks at last,<BR>
And Vulcan rides in triumph o'er the waste;<BR>
The pastor, pleas'd with his dire victory,<BR>
Beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky:<BR>
So Pallas' troops their scatter'd strength unite,<BR>
And, pouring on their foes, their prince delight.</P>
<P>Halesus came, fierce with desire of blood;<BR>
But first collected in his arms he stood:<BR>
Advancing then, he plied the spear so well,<BR>
Ladon, Demodocus, and Pheres fell.<BR>
Around his head he toss'd his glitt'ring brand,<BR>
And from Strymonius hew'd his better hand,<BR>
Held up to guard his throat; then hurl'd a stone<BR>
At Thoas' ample front, and pierc'd the bone:<BR>
It struck beneath the space of either eye;<BR>
And blood, and mingled brains, together fly.<BR>
Deep skill'd in future fates, Halesus' sire<BR>
Did with the youth to lonely groves retire:<BR>
But, when the father's mortal race was run,<BR>
Dire destiny laid hold upon the son,<BR>
And haul'd him to the war, to find, beneath<BR>
Th' Evandrian spear, a memorable death.<BR>
Pallas th' encounter seeks, but, ere he throws,<BR>
To Tuscan Tiber thus address'd his vows:<BR>
"O sacred stream, direct my flying dart,<BR>
And give to pass the proud Halesus' heart!<BR>
His arms and spoils thy holy oak shall bear."<BR>
Pleas'd with the bribe, the god receiv'd his pray'r:<BR>
For, while his shield protects a friend distress'd,<BR>
The dart came driving on, and pierc'd his breast.</P>
<P>But Lausus, no small portion of the war,<BR>
Permits not panic fear to reign too far,<BR>
Caus'd by the death of so renown'd a knight;<BR>
But by his own example cheers the fight.<BR>
Fierce Abas first he slew; Abas, the stay<BR>
Of Trojan hopes, and hindrance of the day.<BR>
The Phrygian troops escap'd the Greeks in vain:<BR>
They, and their mix'd allies, now load the plain.<BR>
To the rude shock of war both armies came;<BR>
Their leaders equal, and their strength the same.<BR>
The rear so press'd the front, they could not wield<BR>
Their angry weapons, to dispute the field.<BR>
Here Pallas urges on, and Lausus there:<BR>
Of equal youth and beauty both appear,<BR>
But both by fate forbid to breathe their native air.<BR>
Their congress in the field great Jove withstands:<BR>
Both doom'd to fall, but fall by greater hands.</P>
<P>Meantime Juturna warns the Daunian chief<BR>
Of Lausus' danger, urging swift relief.<BR>
With his driv'n chariot he divides the crowd,<BR>
And, making to his friends, thus calls aloud:<BR>
"Let none presume his needless aid to join;<BR>
Retire, and clear the field; the fight is mine:<BR>
To this right hand is Pallas only due;<BR>
O were his father here, my just revenge to view!"<BR>
From the forbidden space his men retir'd.<BR>
Pallas their awe, and his stern words, admir'd;<BR>
Survey'd him o'er and o'er with wond'ring sight,<BR>
Struck with his haughty mien, and tow'ring height.<BR>
Then to the king: "Your empty vaunts forbear;<BR>
Success I hope, and fate I cannot fear;<BR>
Alive or dead, I shall deserve a name;<BR>
Jove is impartial, and to both the same."<BR>
He said, and to the void advanc'd his pace:<BR>
Pale horror sate on each Arcadian face.<BR>
Then Turnus, from his chariot leaping light,<BR>
Address'd himself on foot to single fight.<BR>
And, as a lion- when he spies from far<BR>
A bull that seems to meditate the war,<BR>
Bending his neck, and spurning back the sand-<BR>
Runs roaring downward from his hilly stand:<BR>
Imagine eager Turnus not more slow,<BR>
To rush from high on his unequal foe.</P>
<P>Young Pallas, when he saw the chief advance<BR>
Within due distance of his flying lance,<BR>
Prepares to charge him first, resolv'd to try<BR>
If fortune would his want of force supply;<BR>
And thus to Heav'n and Hercules address'd:<BR>
"Alcides, once on earth Evander's guest,<BR>
His son adjures you by those holy rites,<BR>
That hospitable board, those genial nights;<BR>
Assist my great attempt to gain this prize,<BR>
And let proud Turnus view, with dying eyes,<BR>
His ravish'd spoils." 'T was heard, the vain request;<BR>
Alcides mourn'd, and stifled sighs within his breast.<BR>
Then Jove, to soothe his sorrow, thus began:<BR>
"Short bounds of life are set to mortal man.<BR>
'T is virtue's work alone to stretch the narrow span.<BR>
So many sons of gods, in bloody fight,<BR>
Around the walls of Troy, have lost the light:<BR>
My own Sarpedon fell beneath his foe;<BR>
Nor I, his mighty sire, could ward the blow.<BR>
Ev'n Turnus shortly shall resign his breath,<BR>
And stands already on the verge of death."<BR>
This said, the god permits the fatal fight,<BR>
But from the Latian fields averts his sight.</P>
<P>Now with full force his spear young Pallas threw,<BR>
And, having thrown, his shining fauchion drew<BR>
The steel just graz'd along the shoulder joint,<BR>
And mark'd it slightly with the glancing point,<BR>
Fierce Turnus first to nearer distance drew,<BR>
And pois'd his pointed spear, before he threw:<BR>
Then, as the winged weapon whizz'd along,<BR>
"See now," said he, "whose arm is better strung."<BR>
The spear kept on the fatal course, unstay'd<BR>
By plates of ir'n, which o'er the shield were laid:<BR>
Thro' folded brass and tough bull hides it pass'd,<BR>
His corslet pierc'd, and reach'd his heart at last.<BR>
In vain the youth tugs at the broken wood;<BR>
The soul comes issuing with the vital blood:<BR>
He falls; his arms upon his body sound;<BR>
And with his bloody teeth he bites the ground.</P>
<P>Turnus bestrode the corpse: "Arcadians, hear,"<BR>
Said he; "my message to your master bear:<BR>
Such as the sire deserv'd, the son I send;<BR>
It costs him dear to be the Phrygians' friend.<BR>
The lifeless body, tell him, I bestow,<BR>
Unask'd, to rest his wand'ring ghost below."<BR>
He said, and trampled down with all the force<BR>
Of his left foot, and spurn'd the wretched corse;<BR>
Then snatch'd the shining belt, with gold inlaid;<BR>
The belt Eurytion's artful hands had made,<BR>
Where fifty fatal brides, express'd to sight,<BR>
All in the compass of one mournful night,<BR>
Depriv'd their bridegrooms of returning light.</P>
<P>In an ill hour insulting Turnus tore<BR>
Those golden spoils, and in a worse he wore.<BR>
O mortals, blind in fate, who never know<BR>
To bear high fortune, or endure the low!<BR>
The time shall come, when Turnus, but in vain,<BR>
Shall wish untouch'd the trophies of the slain;<BR>
Shall wish the fatal belt were far away,<BR>
And curse the dire remembrance of the day.</P>
<P>The sad Arcadians, from th' unhappy field,<BR>
Bear back the breathless body on a shield.<BR>
O grace and grief of war! at once restor'd,<BR>
With praises, to thy sire, at once deplor'd!<BR>
One day first sent thee to the fighting field,<BR>
Beheld whole heaps of foes in battle kill'd;<BR>
One day beheld thee dead, and borne upon thy shield.<BR>
This dismal news, not from uncertain fame,<BR>
But sad spectators, to the hero came:<BR>
His friends upon the brink of ruin stand,<BR>
Unless reliev'd by his victorious hand.<BR>
He whirls his sword around, without delay,<BR>
And hews thro' adverse foes an ample way,<BR>
To find fierce Turnus, of his conquest proud:<BR>
Evander, Pallas, all that friendship ow'd<BR>
To large deserts, are present to his eyes;<BR>
His plighted hand, and hospitable ties.</P>
<P>Four sons of Sulmo, four whom Ufens bred,<BR>
He took in fight, and living victims led,<BR>
To please the ghost of Pallas, and expire,<BR>
In sacrifice, before his fun'ral fire.<BR>
At Magus next he threw: he stoop'd below<BR>
The flying spear, and shunn'd the promis'd blow;<BR>
Then, creeping, clasp'd the hero's knees, and pray'd:<BR>
"By young Iulus, by thy father's shade,<BR>
O spare my life, and send me back to see<BR>
My longing sire, and tender progeny!<BR>
A lofty house I have, and wealth untold,<BR>
In silver ingots, and in bars of gold:<BR>
All these, and sums besides, which see no day,<BR>
The ransom of this one poor life shall pay.<BR>
If I survive, will Troy the less prevail?<BR>
A single soul's too light to turn the scale."<BR>
He said. The hero sternly thus replied:<BR>
"Thy bars and ingots, and the sums beside,<BR>
Leave for thy children's lot. Thy Turnus broke<BR>
All rules of war by one relentless stroke,<BR>
When Pallas fell: so deems, nor deems alone<BR>
My father's shadow, but my living son."<BR>
Thus having said, of kind remorse bereft,<BR>
He seiz'd his helm, and dragg'd him with his left;<BR>
Then with his right hand, while his neck he wreath'd,<BR>
Up to the hilts his shining fauchion sheath'd.</P>
<P>Apollo's priest, Emonides, was near;<BR>
His holy fillets on his front appear;<BR>
Glitt'ring in arms, he shone amidst the crowd;<BR>
Much of his god, more of his purple, proud.<BR>
Him the fierce Trojan follow'd thro' the field:<BR>
The holy coward fell; and, forc'd to yield,<BR>
The prince stood o'er the priest, and, at one blow,<BR>
Sent him an off'ring to the shades below.<BR>
His arms Seresthus on his shoulders bears,<BR>
Design'd a trophy to the God of Wars.</P>
<P>Vulcanian Caeculus renews the fight,<BR>
And Umbro, born upon the mountains' height.<BR>
The champion cheers his troops t' encounter those,<BR>
And seeks revenge himself on other foes.<BR>
At Anxur's shield he drove; and, at the blow,<BR>
Both shield and arm to ground together go.<BR>
Anxur had boasted much of magic charms,<BR>
And thought he wore impenetrable arms,<BR>
So made by mutter'd spells; and, from the spheres,<BR>
Had life secur'd, in vain, for length of years.<BR>
Then Tarquitus the field triumph trod;<BR>
A nymph his mother, his sire a god.<BR>
Exulting in bright arms, he braves the prince:<BR>
With his protended lance he makes defense;<BR>
Bears back his feeble foe; then, pressing on,<BR>
Arrests his better hand, and drags him down;<BR>
Stands o'er the prostrate wretch, and, as he lay,<BR>
Vain tales inventing, and prepar'd to pray,<BR>
Mows off his head: the trunk a moment stood,<BR>
Then sunk, and roll'd along the sand in blood.<BR>
The vengeful victor thus upbraids the slain:<BR>
"Lie there, proud man, unpitied, on the plain;<BR>
Lie there, inglorious, and without a tomb,<BR>
Far from thy mother and thy native home,<BR>
Exposed to savage beasts, and birds of prey,<BR>
Or thrown for food to monsters of the sea."</P>
<P>On Lycas and Antaeus next he ran,<BR>
Two chiefs of Turnus, and who led his van.<BR>
They fled for fear; with these, he chas'd along<BR>
Camers the yellow-lock'd, and Numa strong;<BR>
Both great in arms, and both were fair and young.<BR>
Camers was son to Volscens lately slain,<BR>
In wealth surpassing all the Latian train,<BR>
And in Amycla fix'd his silent easy reign.<BR>
And, as Aegaeon, when with heav'n he strove,<BR>
Stood opposite in arms to mighty Jove;<BR>
Mov'd all his hundred hands, provok'd the war,<BR>
Defied the forky lightning from afar;<BR>
At fifty mouths his flaming breath expires,<BR>
And flash for flash returns, and fires for fires;<BR>
In his right hand as many swords he wields,<BR>
And takes the thunder on as many shields:<BR>
With strength like his, the Trojan hero stood;<BR>
And soon the fields with falling corps were strow'd,<BR>
When once his fauchion found the taste of blood.<BR>
With fury scarce to be conceiv'd, he flew<BR>
Against Niphaeus, whom four coursers drew.<BR>
They, when they see the fiery chief advance,<BR>
And pushing at their chests his pointed lance,<BR>
Wheel'd with so swift a motion, mad with fear,<BR>
They threw their master headlong from the chair.<BR>
They stare, they start, nor stop their course, before<BR>
They bear the bounding chariot to the shore.</P>
<P>Now Lucagus and Liger scour the plains,<BR>
With two white steeds; but Liger holds the reins,<BR>
And Lucagus the lofty seat maintains:<BR>
Bold brethren both. The former wav'd in air<BR>
His flaming sword: Aeneas couch'd his spear,<BR>
Unus'd to threats, and more unus'd to fear.<BR>
Then Liger thus: "Thy confidence is vain<BR>
To scape from hence, as from the Trojan plain:<BR>
Nor these the steeds which Diomede bestrode,<BR>
Nor this the chariot where Achilles rode;<BR>
Nor Venus' veil is here, near Neptune's shield;<BR>
Thy fatal hour is come, and this the field."<BR>
Thus Liger vainly vaunts: the Trojan<BR>
Return'd his answer with his flying spear.<BR>
As Lucagus, to lash his horses, bends,<BR>
Prone to the wheels, and his left foot protends,<BR>
Prepar'd for fight; the fatal dart arrives,<BR>
And thro' the borders of his buckler drives;<BR>
Pass'd thro' and pierc'd his groin: the deadly wound,<BR>
Cast from his chariot, roll'd him on the ground.<BR>
Whom thus the chief upbraids with scornful spite:<BR>
"Blame not the slowness of your steeds in flight;<BR>
Vain shadows did not force their swift retreat;<BR>
But you yourself forsake your empty seat."<BR>
He said, and seiz'd at once the loosen'd rein;<BR>
For Liger lay already on the plain,<BR>
By the same shock: then, stretching out his hands,<BR>
The recreant thus his wretched life demands:<BR>
"Now, by thyself, O more than mortal man!<BR>
By her and him from whom thy breath began,<BR>
Who form'd thee thus divine, I beg thee, spare<BR>
This forfeit life, and hear thy suppliant's pray'r."<BR>
Thus much he spoke, and more he would have said;<BR>
But the stern hero turn'd aside his head,<BR>
And cut him short: "I hear another man;<BR>
You talk'd not thus before the fight began.<BR>
Now take your turn; and, as a brother should,<BR>
Attend your brother to the Stygian flood."<BR>
Then thro' his breast his fatal sword he sent,<BR>
And the soul issued at the gaping vent.</P>
<P>As storms the skies, and torrents tear the ground,<BR>
Thus rag'd the prince, and scatter'd deaths around.<BR>
At length Ascanius and the Trojan train<BR>
Broke from the camp, so long besieg'd in vain.</P>
<P>Meantime the King of Gods and Mortal Man<BR>
Held conference with his queen, and thus began:<BR>
"My sister goddess, and well-pleasing wife,<BR>
Still think you Venus' aid supports the strife-<BR>
Sustains her Trojans- or themselves, alone,<BR>
With inborn valor force their fortune on?<BR>
How fierce in fight, with courage undecay'd!<BR>
Judge if such warriors want immortal aid."<BR>
To whom the goddess with the charming eyes,<BR>
Soft in her tone, submissively replies:<BR>
"Why, O my sov'reign lord, whose frown I fear,<BR>
And cannot, unconcern'd, your anger bear;<BR>
Why urge you thus my grief? when, if I still<BR>
(As once I was) were mistress of your will,<BR>
From your almighty pow'r your pleasing wife<BR>
Might gain the grace of length'ning Turnus' life,<BR>
Securely snatch him from the fatal fight,<BR>
And give him to his aged father's sight.<BR>
Now let him perish, since you hold it good,<BR>
And glut the Trojans with his pious blood.<BR>
Yet from our lineage he derives his name,<BR>
And, in the fourth degree, from god Pilumnus came;<BR>
Yet he devoutly pays you rites divine,<BR>
And offers daily incense at your shrine."</P>
<P>Then shortly thus the sov'reign god replied:<BR>
"Since in my pow'r and goodness you confide,<BR>
If for a little space, a lengthen'd span,<BR>
You beg reprieve for this expiring man,<BR>
I grant you leave to take your Turnus hence<BR>
From instant fate, and can so far dispense.<BR>
But, if some secret meaning lies beneath,<BR>
To save the short-liv'd youth from destin'd death,<BR>
Or if a farther thought you entertain,<BR>
To change the fates; you feed your hopes in vain."<BR>
To whom the goddess thus, with weeping eyes:<BR>
"And what if that request, your tongue denies,<BR>
Your heart should grant; and not a short reprieve,<BR>
But length of certain life, to Turnus give?<BR>
Now speedy death attends the guiltless youth,<BR>
If my presaging soul divines with truth;<BR>
Which, O! I wish, might err thro' causeless fears,<BR>
And you (for you have pow'r) prolong his years!"</P>
<P>Thus having said, involv'd in clouds, she flies,<BR>
And drives a storm before her thro' the skies.<BR>
Swift she descends, alighting on the plain,<BR>
Where the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain.<BR>
Of air condens'd a specter soon she made;<BR>
And, what Aeneas was, such seem'd the shade.<BR>
Adorn'd with Dardan arms, the phantom bore<BR>
His head aloft; a plumy crest he wore;<BR>
This hand appear'd a shining sword to wield,.<BR>
And that sustain'd an imitated shield.<BR>
With manly mien he stalk'd along the ground,<BR>
Nor wanted voice belied, nor vaunting sound.<BR>
(Thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight,<BR>
Or dreadful visions in our dreams by night.)<BR>
The specter seems the Daunian chief to dare,<BR>
And flourishes his empty sword in air.<BR>
At this, advancing, Turnus hurl'd his spear:<BR>
The phantom wheel'd, and seem'd to fly for fear.<BR>
Deluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled,<BR>
And with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed.<BR>
"Whether, O coward?" (thus he calls aloud,<BR>
Nor found he spoke to wind, and chas'd a cloud,)<BR>
"Why thus forsake your bride! Receive from me<BR>
The fated land you sought so long by sea."<BR>
He said, and, brandishing at once his blade,<BR>
With eager pace pursued the flying shade.<BR>
By chance a ship was fasten'd to the shore,<BR>
Which from old Clusium King Osinius bore:<BR>
The plank was ready laid for safe ascent;<BR>
For shelter there the trembling shadow bent,<BR>
And skipp't and skulk'd, and under hatches went.<BR>
Exulting Turnus, with regardless haste,<BR>
Ascends the plank, and to the galley pass'd.<BR>
Scarce had he reach'd the prow: Saturnia's hand<BR>
The haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land.<BR>
With wind in poop, the vessel plows the sea,<BR>
And measures back with speed her former way.<BR>
Meantime Aeneas seeks his absent foe,<BR>
And sends his slaughter'd troops to shades below.</P>
<P>The guileful phantom now forsook the shroud,<BR>
And flew sublime, and vanish'd in a cloud.<BR>
Too late young Turnus the delusion found,<BR>
Far on the sea, still making from the ground.<BR>
Then, thankless for a life redeem'd by shame,<BR>
With sense of honor stung, and forfeit fame,<BR>
Fearful besides of what in fight had pass'd,<BR>
His hands and haggard eyes to heav'n he cast;<BR>
"O Jove!" he cried, "for what offense have<BR>
Deserv'd to bear this endless infamy?<BR>
Whence am I forc'd, and whether am I borne?<BR>
How, and with what reproach, shall I return?<BR>
Shall ever I behold the Latian plain,<BR>
Or see Laurentum's lofty tow'rs again?<BR>
What will they say of their deserting chief<BR>
The war was mine: I fly from their relief;<BR>
I led to slaughter, and in slaughter leave;<BR>
And ev'n from hence their dying groans receive.<BR>
Here, overmatch'd in fight, in heaps they lie;<BR>
There, scatter'd o'er the fields, ignobly fly.<BR>
Gape wide, O earth, and draw me down alive!<BR>
Or, O ye pitying winds, a wretch relieve!<BR>
On sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive;<BR>
Or set me shipwrack'd on some desart shore,<BR>
Where no Rutulian eyes may see me more,<BR>
Unknown to friends, or foes, or conscious Fame,<BR>
Lest she should follow, and my flight proclaim."</P>
<P>Thus Turnus rav'd, and various fates revolv'd:<BR>
The choice was doubtful, but the death resolv'd.<BR>
And now the sword, and now the sea took place,<BR>
That to revenge, and this to purge disgrace.<BR>
Sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main,<BR>
By stretch of arms the distant shore to gain.<BR>
Thrice he the sword assay'd, and thrice the flood;<BR>
But Juno, mov'd with pity, both withstood.<BR>
And thrice repress'd his rage; strong gales supplied,<BR>
And push'd the vessel o'er the swelling tide.<BR>
At length she lands him on his native shores,<BR>
And to his father's longing arms restores.</P>
<P>Meantime, by Jove's impulse, Mezentius arm'd,<BR>
Succeeding Turnus, with his ardor warm'd<BR>
His fainting friends, reproach'd their shameful flight,<BR>
Repell'd the victors, and renew'd the fight.<BR>
Against their king the Tuscan troops conspire;<BR>
Such is their hate, and such their fierce desire<BR>
Of wish'd revenge: on him, and him alone,<BR>
All hands employ'd, and all their darts are thrown.<BR>
He, like a solid rock by seas inclos'd,<BR>
To raging winds and roaring waves oppos'd,<BR>
From his proud summit looking down, disdains<BR>
Their empty menace, and unmov'd remains.</P>
<P>Beneath his feet fell haughty Hebrus dead,<BR>
Then Latagus, and Palmus as he fled.<BR>
At Latagus a weighty stone he flung:<BR>
His face was flatted, and his helmet rung.<BR>
But Palmus from behind receives his wound;<BR>
Hamstring'd he falls, and grovels on the ground:<BR>
His crest and armor, from his body torn,<BR>
Thy shoulders, Lausus, and thy head adorn.<BR>
Evas and Mimas, both of Troy, he slew.<BR>
Mimas his birth from fair Theano drew,<BR>
Born on that fatal night, when, big with fire,<BR>
The queen produc'd young Paris to his sire:<BR>
But Paris in the Phrygian fields was slain,<BR>
Unthinking Mimas on the Latian plain.</P>
<P>And, as a savage boar, on mountains bred,<BR>
With forest mast and fatt'ning marshes fed,<BR>
When once he sees himself in toils inclos'd,<BR>
By huntsmen and their eager hounds oppos'd-<BR>
He whets his tusks, and turns, and dares the war;<BR>
Th' invaders dart their jav'lins from afar:<BR>
All keep aloof, and safely shout around;<BR>
But none presumes to give a nearer wound:<BR>
He frets and froths, erects his bristled hide,<BR>
And shakes a grove of lances from his side:<BR>
Not otherwise the troops, with hate inspir'd,<BR>
And just revenge against the tyrant fir'd,<BR>
Their darts with clamor at a distance drive,<BR>
And only keep the languish'd war alive.</P>
<P>From Coritus came Acron to the fight,<BR>
Who left his spouse betroth'd, and unconsummate night.<BR>
Mezentius sees him thro' the squadrons ride,<BR>
Proud of the purple favors of his bride.<BR>
Then, as a hungry lion, who beholds<BR>
A gamesome goat, who frisks about the folds,<BR>
Or beamy stag, that grazes on the plain-<BR>
He runs, he roars, he shakes his rising mane,<BR>
He grins, and opens wide his greedy jaws;<BR>
The prey lies panting underneath his paws:<BR>
He fills his famish'd maw; his mouth runs o'er<BR>
With unchew'd morsels, while he churns the gore:<BR>
So proud Mezentius rushes on his foes,<BR>
And first unhappy Acron overthrows:<BR>
Stretch'd at his length, he spurns the swarthy ground;<BR>
The lance, besmear'd with blood, lies broken in the wound.<BR>
Then with disdain the haughty victor view'd<BR>
Orodes flying, nor the wretch pursued,<BR>
Nor thought the dastard's back deserv'd a wound,<BR>
But, running, gain'd th' advantage of the ground:<BR>
Then turning short, he met him face to face,<BR>
To give his victor the better grace.<BR>
Orodes falls, equal fight oppress'd:<BR>
Mezentius fix'd his foot upon his breast,<BR>
And rested lance; and thus aloud he cries:<BR>
"Lo! here the champion of my rebels lies!"<BR>
The fields around with Io Paean! ring;<BR>
And peals of shouts applaud the conqu'ring king.<BR>
At this the vanquish'd, with his dying breath,<BR>
Thus faintly spoke, and prophesied in death:<BR>
"Nor thou, proud man, unpunish'd shalt remain:<BR>
Like death attends thee on this fatal plain."<BR>
Then, sourly smiling, thus the king replied:<BR>
"For what belongs to me, let Jove provide;<BR>
But die thou first, whatever chance ensue."<BR>
He said, and from the wound the weapon drew.<BR>
A hov'ring mist came swimming o'er his sight,<BR>
And seal'd his eyes in everlasting night.</P>
<P>By Caedicus, Alcathous was slain;<BR>
Sacrator laid Hydaspes on the plain;<BR>
Orses the strong to greater strength must yield;<BR>
He, with Parthenius, were by Rapo kill'd.<BR>
Then brave Messapus Ericetes slew,<BR>
Who from Lycaon's blood his lineage drew.<BR>
But from his headstrong horse his fate he found,<BR>
Who threw his master, as he made a bound:<BR>
The chief, alighting, stuck him to the ground;<BR>
Then Clonius, hand to hand, on foot assails:<BR>
The Trojan sinks, and Neptune's son prevails.<BR>
Agis the Lycian, stepping forth with pride,<BR>
To single fight the boldest foe defied;<BR>
Whom Tuscan Valerus by force o'ercame,<BR>
And not belied his mighty father's fame.<BR>
Salius to death the great Antronius sent:<BR>
But the same fate the victor underwent,<BR>
Slain by Nealces' hand, well-skill'd to throw<BR>
The flying dart, and draw the far-deceiving bow.</P>
<P>Thus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance;<BR>
By turns they quit their ground, by turns advance:<BR>
Victors and vanquish'd, in the various field,<BR>
Nor wholly overcome, nor wholly yield.<BR>
The gods from heav'n survey the fatal strife,<BR>
And mourn the miseries of human life.<BR>
Above the rest, two goddesses appear<BR>
Concern'd for each: here Venus, Juno there.<BR>
Amidst the crowd, infernal Ate shakes<BR>
Her scourge aloft, and crest of hissing snakes.</P>
<P>Once more the proud Mezentius, with disdain,<BR>
Brandish'd his spear, and rush'd into the plain,<BR>
Where tow'ring in the midmost rank she stood,<BR>
Like tall Orion stalking o'er the flood.<BR>
(When with his brawny breast he cuts the waves,<BR>
His shoulders scarce the topmost billow laves),<BR>
Or like a mountain ash, whose roots are spread,<BR>
Deep fix'd in earth; in clouds he hides his head.</P>
<P>The Trojan prince beheld him from afar,<BR>
And dauntless undertook the doubtful war.<BR>
Collected in his strength, and like a rock,<BR>
Pois'd on his base, Mezentius stood the shock.<BR>
He stood, and, measuring first with careful eyes<BR>
The space his spear could reach, aloud he cries:<BR>
"My strong right hand, and sword, assist my stroke!<BR>
(Those only gods Mezentius will invoke.)<BR>
His armor, from the Trojan pirate torn,<BR>
By my triumphant Lausus shall be worn."<BR>
He said; and with his utmost force he threw<BR>
The massy spear, which, hissing as it flew,<BR>
Reach'd the celestial shield, that stopp'd the course;<BR>
But, glancing thence, the yet unbroken force<BR>
Took a new bent obliquely, and betwixt<BR>
The side and bowels fam'd Anthores fix'd.<BR>
Anthores had from Argos travel'd far,<BR>
Alcides' friend, and brother of the war;<BR>
Till, tir'd with toils, fair Italy he chose,<BR>
And in Evander's palace sought repose.<BR>
Now, falling by another's wound, his eyes<BR>
He cast to heav'n, on Argos thinks, and dies.</P>
<P>The pious Trojan then his jav'lin sent;<BR>
The shield gave way; thro' treble plates it went<BR>
Of solid brass, of linen trebly roll'd,<BR>
And three bull hides which round the buckler fold.<BR>
All these it pass'd, resistless in the course,<BR>
Transpierc'd his thigh, and spent its dying force.<BR>
The gaping wound gush'd out a crimson flood.<BR>
The Trojan, glad with sight of hostile blood,<BR>
His faunchion drew, to closer fight address'd,<BR>
And with new force his fainting foe oppress'd.</P>
<P>His father's peril Lausus view'd with grief;<BR>
He sigh'd, he wept, he ran to his relief.<BR>
And here, heroic youth, 't is here I must<BR>
To thy immortal memory be just,<BR>
And sing an act so noble and so new,<BR>
Posterity will scarce believe 't is true.<BR>
Pain'd with his wound, and useless for the fight,<BR>
The father sought to save himself by flight:<BR>
Incumber'd, slow he dragg'd the spear along,<BR>
Which pierc'd his thigh, and in his buckler hung.<BR>
The pious youth, resolv'd on death, below<BR>
The lifted sword springs forth to face the foe;<BR>
Protects his parent, and prevents the blow.<BR>
Shouts of applause ran ringing thro' the field,<BR>
To see the son the vanquish'd father shield.<BR>
All, fir'd with gen'rous indignation, strive,<BR>
And with a storm of darts to distance drive<BR>
The Trojan chief, who, held at bay from far,<BR>
On his Vulcanian orb sustain'd the war.</P>
<P>As, when thick hail comes rattling in the wind,<BR>
The plowman, passenger, and lab'ring hind<BR>
For shelter to the neighb'ring covert fly,<BR>
Or hous'd, or safe in hollow caverns lie;<BR>
But, that o'erblown, when heav'n above 'em smiles,<BR>
Return to travel, and renew their toils:<BR>
Aeneas thus, o'erwhelmed on ev'ry side,<BR>
The storm of darts, undaunted, did abide;<BR>
And thus to Lausus loud with friendly threat'ning cried:<BR>
"Why wilt thou rush to certain death, and rage<BR>
In rash attempts, beyond thy tender age,<BR>
Betray'd by pious love?" Nor, thus forborne,<BR>
The youth desists, but with insulting scorn<BR>
Provokes the ling'ring prince, whose patience, tir'd,<BR>
Gave place; and all his breast with fury fir'd.<BR>
For now the Fates prepar'd their sharpen'd shears;<BR>
And lifted high the flaming sword appears,<BR>
Which, full descending with a frightful sway,<BR>
Thro' shield and corslet forc'd th' impetuous way,<BR>
And buried deep in his fair bosom lay.<BR>
The purple streams thro' the thin armor strove,<BR>
And drench'd th' imbroider'd coat his mother wove;<BR>
And life at length forsook his heaving heart,<BR>
Loth from so sweet a mansion to depart.</P>
<P>But when, with blood and paleness all o'erspread,<BR>
The pious prince beheld young Lausus dead,<BR>
He griev'd; he wept; the sight an image brought<BR>
Of his own filial love, a sadly pleasing thought:<BR>
Then stretch'd his hand to hold him up, and said:<BR>
"Poor hapless youth! what praises can be paid<BR>
To love so great, to such transcendent store<BR>
Of early worth, and sure presage of more?<BR>
Accept whate'er Aeneas can afford;<BR>
Untouch'd thy arms, untaken be thy sword;<BR>
And all that pleas'd thee living, still remain<BR>
Inviolate, and sacred to the slain.<BR>
Thy body on thy parents I bestow,<BR>
To rest thy soul, at least, if shadows know,<BR>
Or have a sense of human things below.<BR>
There to thy fellow ghosts with glory tell:<BR>
''T was by the great Aeneas hand I fell.'"<BR>
With this, his distant friends he beckons near,<BR>
Provokes their duty, and prevents their fear:<BR>
Himself assists to lift him from the ground,<BR>
With clotted locks, and blood that well'd from out the wound.</P>
<P>Meantime, his father, now no father, stood,<BR>
And wash'd his wounds by Tiber's yellow flood:<BR>
Oppress'd with anguish, panting, and o'erspent,<BR>
His fainting limbs against an oak he leant.<BR>
A bough his brazen helmet did sustain;<BR>
His heavier arms lay scatter'd on the plain:<BR>
A chosen train of youth around him stand;<BR>
His drooping head was rested on his hand:<BR>
His grisly beard his pensive bosom sought;<BR>
And all on Lausus ran his restless thought.<BR>
Careful, concern'd his danger to prevent,<BR>
He much enquir'd, and many a message sent<BR>
To warn him from the field- alas! in vain!<BR>
Behold, his mournful followers bear him slain!<BR>
O'er his broad shield still gush'd the yawning wound,<BR>
And drew a bloody trail along the ground.<BR>
Far off he heard their cries, far off divin'd<BR>
The dire event, with a foreboding mind.<BR>
With dust he sprinkled first his hoary head;<BR>
Then both his lifted hands to heav'n he spread;<BR>
Last, the dear corpse embracing, thus he said:<BR>
"What joys, alas! could this frail being give,<BR>
That I have been so covetous to live?<BR>
To see my son, and such a son, resign<BR>
His life, a ransom for preserving mine!<BR>
And am I then preserv'd, and art thou lost?<BR>
How much too dear has that redemption cost!<BR>
'T is now my bitter banishment I feel:<BR>
This is a wound too deep for time to heal.<BR>
My guilt thy growing virtues did defame;<BR>
My blackness blotted thy unblemish'd name.<BR>
Chas'd from a throne, abandon'd, and exil'd<BR>
For foul misdeeds, were punishments too mild:<BR>
I ow'd my people these, and, from their hate,<BR>
With less resentment could have borne my fate.<BR>
And yet I live, and yet sustain the sight<BR>
Of hated men, and of more hated light:<BR>
But will not long." With that he rais'd from ground<BR>
His fainting limbs, that stagger'd with his wound;<BR>
Yet, with a mind resolv'd, and unappall'd<BR>
With pains or perils, for his courser call'd<BR>
Well-mouth'd, well-manag'd, whom himself did dress<BR>
With daily care, and mounted with success;<BR>
His aid in arms, his ornament in peace.</P>
<P>Soothing his courage with a gentle stroke,<BR>
The steed seem'd sensible, while thus he spoke:<BR>
"O Rhoebus, we have liv'd too long for me-<BR>
If life and long were terms that could agree!<BR>
This day thou either shalt bring back the head<BR>
And bloody trophies of the Trojan dead;<BR>
This day thou either shalt revenge my woe,<BR>
For murther'd Lausus, on his cruel foe;<BR>
Or, if inexorable fate deny<BR>
Our conquest, with thy conquer'd master die:<BR>
For, after such a lord, rest secure,<BR>
Thou wilt no foreign reins, or Trojan load endure."<BR>
He said; and straight th' officious courser kneels,<BR>
To take his wonted weight. His hands he fills<BR>
With pointed jav'lins; on his head he lac'd<BR>
His glitt'ring helm, which terribly was grac'd<BR>
With waving horsehair, nodding from afar;<BR>
Then spurr'd his thund'ring steed amidst the war.<BR>
Love, anguish, wrath, and grief, to madness wrought,<BR>
Despair, and secret shame, and conscious thought<BR>
Of inborn worth, his lab'ring soul oppress'd,<BR>
Roll'd in his eyes, and rag'd within his breast.<BR>
Then loud he call'd Aeneas thrice by name:<BR>
The loud repeated voice to glad Aeneas came.<BR>
"Great Jove," he said, "and the far-shooting god,<BR>
Inspire thy mind to make thy challenge good!"<BR>
He spoke no more; but hasten'd, void of fear,<BR>
And threaten'd with his long protended spear.</P>
<P>To whom Mezentius thus: "Thy vaunts are vain.<BR>
My Lausus lies extended on the plain:<BR>
He's lost! thy conquest is already won;<BR>
The wretched sire is murther'd in the son.<BR>
Nor fate I fear, but all the gods defy.<BR>
Forbear thy threats: my bus'ness is to die;<BR>
But first receive this parting legacy."<BR>
He said; and straight a whirling dart he sent;<BR>
Another after, and another went.<BR>
Round in a spacious ring he rides the field,<BR>
And vainly plies th' impenetrable shield.<BR>
Thrice rode he round; and thrice Aeneas wheel'd,<BR>
Turn'd as he turn'd: the golden orb withstood<BR>
The strokes, and bore about an iron wood.<BR>
Impatient of delay, and weary grown,<BR>
Still to defend, and to defend alone,<BR>
To wrench the darts which in his buckler light,<BR>
Urg'd and o'er-labor'd in unequal fight;<BR>
At length resolv'd, he throws with all his force<BR>
Full at the temples of the warrior horse.<BR>
Just where the stroke was aim'd, th' unerring spear<BR>
Made way, and stood transfix'd thro' either ear.<BR>
Seiz'd with unwonted pain, surpris'd with fright,<BR>
The wounded steed curvets, and, rais'd upright,<BR>
Lights on his feet before; his hoofs behind<BR>
Spring up in air aloft, and lash the wind.<BR>
Down comes the rider headlong from his height:<BR>
His horse came after with unwieldy weight,<BR>
And, flound'ring forward, pitching on his head,<BR>
His lord's incumber'd shoulder overlaid.</P>
<P>From either host, the mingled shouts and cries<BR>
Of Trojans and Rutulians rend the skies.<BR>
Aeneas, hast'ning, wav'd his fatal sword<BR>
High o'er his head, with this reproachful word:<BR>
"Now; where are now thy vaunts, the fierce disdain<BR>
Of proud Mezentius, and the lofty strain?"</P>
<P>Struggling, and wildly staring on the skies,<BR>
With scarce recover'd sight he thus replies:<BR>
"Why these insulting words, this waste of breath,<BR>
To souls undaunted, and secure of death?<BR>
'T is no dishonor for the brave to die,<BR>
Nor came I here with hope victory;<BR>
Nor ask I life, nor fought with that design:<BR>
As I had us'd my fortune, use thou thine.<BR>
My dying son contracted no such band;<BR>
The gift is hateful from his murd'rer's hand.<BR>
For this, this only favor let me sue,<BR>
If pity can to conquer'd foes be due:<BR>
Refuse it not; but let my body have<BR>
The last retreat of humankind, a grave.<BR>
Too well I know th' insulting people's hate;<BR>
Protect me from their vengeance after fate:<BR>
This refuge for my poor remains provide,<BR>
And lay my much-lov'd Lausus by my side."<BR>
He said, and to the sword his throat applied.<BR>
The crimson stream distain'd his arms around,<BR>
And the disdainful soul came rushing thro' the wound.</P>
