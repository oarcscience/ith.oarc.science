<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">BOOK I</H1>
<P>Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc'd by fate,<BR>
And haughty Juno's unrelenting hate,<BR>
Expell'd and exil'd, left the Trojan shore.<BR>
Long labors, both by sea and land, he bore,<BR>
And in the doubtful war, before he won<BR>
The Latian realm, and built the destin'd town;<BR>
His banish'd gods restor'd to rites divine,<BR>
And settled sure succession in his line,<BR>
From whence the race of Alban fathers come,<BR>
And the long glories of majestic Rome.</P>
<P>O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate;<BR>
What goddess was provok'd, and whence her hate;<BR>
For what offense the Queen of Heav'n began<BR>
To persecute so brave, so just a man;<BR>
Involv'd his anxious life in endless cares,<BR>
Expos'd to wants, and hurried into wars!<BR>
Can heav'nly minds such high resentment show,<BR>
Or exercise their spite in human woe?</P>
<P>Against the Tiber's mouth, but far away,<BR>
An ancient town was seated on the sea;<BR>
A Tyrian colony; the people made<BR>
Stout for the war, and studious of their trade:<BR>
Carthage the name; belov'd by Juno more<BR>
Than her own Argos, or the Samian shore.<BR>
Here stood her chariot; here, if Heav'n were kind,<BR>
The seat of awful empire she design'd.<BR>
Yet she had heard an ancient rumor fly,<BR>
(Long cited by the people of the sky,)<BR>
That times to come should see the Trojan race<BR>
Her Carthage ruin, and her tow'rs deface;<BR>
Nor thus confin'd, the yoke of sov'reign sway<BR>
Should on the necks of all the nations lay.<BR>
She ponder'd this, and fear'd it was in fate;<BR>
Nor could forget the war she wag'd of late<BR>
For conqu'ring Greece against the Trojan state.<BR>
Besides, long causes working in her mind,<BR>
And secret seeds of envy, lay behind;<BR>
Deep graven in her heart the doom remain'd<BR>
Of partial Paris, and her form disdain'd;<BR>
The grace bestow'd on ravish'd Ganymed,<BR>
Electra's glories, and her injur'd bed.<BR>
Each was a cause alone; and all combin'd<BR>
To kindle vengeance in her haughty mind.<BR>
For this, far distant from the Latian coast<BR>
She drove the remnants of the Trojan host;<BR>
And sev'n long years th' unhappy wand'ring train<BR>
Were toss'd by storms, and scatter'd thro' the main.<BR>
Such time, such toil, requir'd the Roman name,<BR>
Such length of labor for so vast a frame.</P>
<P>Now scarce the Trojan fleet, with sails and oars,<BR>
Had left behind the fair Sicilian shores,<BR>
Ent'ring with cheerful shouts the wat'ry reign,<BR>
And plowing frothy furrows in the main;<BR>
When, lab'ring still with endless discontent,<BR>
The Queen of Heav'n did thus her fury vent:</P>
<P>"Then am I vanquish'd? must I yield?" said she,<BR>
"And must the Trojans reign in Italy?<BR>
So Fate will have it, and Jove adds his force;<BR>
Nor can my pow'r divert their happy course.<BR>
Could angry Pallas, with revengeful spleen,<BR>
The Grecian navy burn, and drown the men?<BR>
She, for the fault of one offending foe,<BR>
The bolts of Jove himself presum'd to throw:<BR>
With whirlwinds from beneath she toss'd the ship,<BR>
And bare expos'd the bosom of the deep;<BR>
Then, as an eagle gripes the trembling game,<BR>
The wretch, yet hissing with her father's flame,<BR>
She strongly seiz'd, and with a burning wound<BR>
Transfix'd, and naked, on a rock she bound.<BR>
But I, who walk in awful state above,<BR>
The majesty of heav'n, the sister wife of Jove,<BR>
For length of years my fruitless force employ<BR>
Against the thin remains of ruin'd Troy!<BR>
What nations now to Juno's pow'r will pray,<BR>
Or off'rings on my slighted altars lay?"</P>
<P>Thus rag'd the goddess; and, with fury fraught.<BR>
The restless regions of the storms she sought,<BR>
Where, in a spacious cave of living stone,<BR>
The tyrant Aeolus, from his airy throne,<BR>
With pow'r imperial curbs the struggling winds,<BR>
And sounding tempests in dark prisons binds.<BR>
This way and that th' impatient captives tend,<BR>
And, pressing for release, the mountains rend.<BR>
High in his hall th' undaunted monarch stands,<BR>
And shakes his scepter, and their rage commands;<BR>
Which did he not, their unresisted sway<BR>
Would sweep the world before them in their way;<BR>
Earth, air, and seas thro' empty space would roll,<BR>
And heav'n would fly before the driving soul.<BR>
In fear of this, the Father of the Gods<BR>
Confin'd their fury to those dark abodes,<BR>
And lock'd 'em safe within, oppress'd with mountain loads;<BR>
Impos'd a king, with arbitrary sway,<BR>
To loose their fetters, or their force allay.<BR>
To whom the suppliant queen her pray'rs address'd,<BR>
And thus the tenor of her suit express'd:</P>
<P>"O Aeolus! for to thee the King of Heav'n<BR>
The pow'r of tempests and of winds has giv'n;<BR>
Thy force alone their fury can restrain,<BR>
And smooth the waves, or swell the troubled main-<BR>
A race of wand'ring slaves, abhorr'd by me,<BR>
With prosp'rous passage cut the Tuscan sea;<BR>
To fruitful Italy their course they steer,<BR>
And for their vanquish'd gods design new temples there.<BR>
Raise all thy winds; with night involve the skies;<BR>
Sink or disperse my fatal enemies.<BR>
Twice sev'n, the charming daughters of the main,<BR>
Around my person wait, and bear my train:<BR>
Succeed my wish, and second my design;<BR>
The fairest, Deiopeia, shall be thine,<BR>
And make thee father of a happy line."</P>
<P>To this the god: "'T is yours, O queen, to will<BR>
The work which duty binds me to fulfil.<BR>
These airy kingdoms, and this wide command,<BR>
Are all the presents of your bounteous hand:<BR>
Yours is my sov'reign's grace; and, as your guest,<BR>
I sit with gods at their celestial feast;<BR>
Raise tempests at your pleasure, or subdue;<BR>
Dispose of empire, which I hold from you."</P>
<P>He said, and hurl'd against the mountain side<BR>
His quiv'ring spear, and all the god applied.<BR>
The raging winds rush thro' the hollow wound,<BR>
And dance aloft in air, and skim along the ground;<BR>
Then, settling on the sea, the surges sweep,<BR>
Raise liquid mountains, and disclose the deep.<BR>
South, East, and West with mix'd confusion roar,<BR>
And roll the foaming billows to the shore.<BR>
The cables crack; the sailors' fearful cries<BR>
Ascend; and sable night involves the skies;<BR>
And heav'n itself is ravish'd from their eyes.<BR>
Loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue;<BR>
Then flashing fires the transient light renew;<BR>
The face of things a frightful image bears,<BR>
And present death in various forms appears.<BR>
Struck with unusual fright, the Trojan chief,<BR>
With lifted hands and eyes, invokes relief;<BR>
And, "Thrice and four times happy those," he cried,<BR>
"That under Ilian walls before their parents died!<BR>
Tydides, bravest of the Grecian train!<BR>
Why could not I by that strong arm be slain,<BR>
And lie by noble Hector on the plain,<BR>
Or great Sarpedon, in those bloody fields<BR>
Where Simois rolls the bodies and the shields<BR>
Of heroes, whose dismember'd hands yet bear<BR>
The dart aloft, and clench the pointed spear!"</P>
<P>Thus while the pious prince his fate bewails,<BR>
Fierce Boreas drove against his flying sails,<BR>
And rent the sheets; the raging billows rise,<BR>
And mount the tossing vessels to the skies:<BR>
Nor can the shiv'ring oars sustain the blow;<BR>
The galley gives her side, and turns her prow;<BR>
While those astern, descending down the steep,<BR>
Thro' gaping waves behold the boiling deep.<BR>
Three ships were hurried by the southern blast,<BR>
And on the secret shelves with fury cast.<BR>
Those hidden rocks th' Ausonian sailors knew:<BR>
They call'd them Altars, when they rose in view,<BR>
And show'd their spacious backs above the flood.<BR>
Three more fierce Eurus, in his angry mood,<BR>
Dash'd on the shallows of the moving sand,<BR>
And in mid ocean left them moor'd aland.<BR>
Orontes' bark, that bore the Lycian crew,<BR>
(A horrid sight!) ev'n in the hero's view,<BR>
From stem to stern by waves was overborne:<BR>
The trembling pilot, from his rudder torn,<BR>
Was headlong hurl'd; thrice round the ship was toss'd,<BR>
Then bulg'd at once, and in the deep was lost;<BR>
And here and there above the waves were seen<BR>
Arms, pictures, precious goods, and floating men.<BR>
The stoutest vessel to the storm gave way,<BR>
And suck'd thro' loosen'd planks the rushing sea.<BR>
Ilioneus was her chief: Alethes old,<BR>
Achates faithful, Abas young and bold,<BR>
Endur'd not less; their ships, with gaping seams,<BR>
Admit the deluge of the briny streams.</P>
<P>Meantime imperial Neptune heard the sound<BR>
Of raging billows breaking on the ground.<BR>
Displeas'd, and fearing for his wat'ry reign,<BR>
He rear'd his awful head above the main,<BR>
Serene in majesty; then roll'd his eyes<BR>
Around the space of earth, and seas, and skies.<BR>
He saw the Trojan fleet dispers'd, distress'd,<BR>
By stormy winds and wintry heav'n oppress'd.<BR>
Full well the god his sister's envy knew,<BR>
And what her aims and what her arts pursue.<BR>
He summon'd Eurus and the western blast,<BR>
And first an angry glance on both he cast;<BR>
Then thus rebuk'd: "Audacious winds! from whence<BR>
This bold attempt, this rebel insolence?<BR>
Is it for you to ravage seas and land,<BR>
Unauthoriz'd by my supreme command?<BR>
To raise such mountains on the troubled main?<BR>
Whom I- but first 't is fit the billows to restrain;<BR>
And then you shall be taught obedience to my reign.<BR>
Hence! to your lord my royal mandate bear-<BR>
The realms of ocean and the fields of air<BR>
Are mine, not his. By fatal lot to me<BR>
The liquid empire fell, and trident of the sea.<BR>
His pow'r to hollow caverns is confin'd:<BR>
There let him reign, the jailer of the wind,<BR>
With hoarse commands his breathing subjects call,<BR>
And boast and bluster in his empty hall."<BR>
He spoke; and, while he spoke, he smooth'd the sea,<BR>
Dispell'd the darkness, and restor'd the day.<BR>
Cymothoe, Triton, and the sea-green train<BR>
Of beauteous nymphs, the daughters of the main,<BR>
Clear from the rocks the vessels with their hands:<BR>
The god himself with ready trident stands,<BR>
And opes the deep, and spreads the moving sands;<BR>
Then heaves them off the shoals. Where'er he guides<BR>
His finny coursers and in triumph rides,<BR>
The waves unruffle and the sea subsides.<BR>
As, when in tumults rise th' ignoble crowd,<BR>
Mad are their motions, and their tongues are loud;<BR>
And stones and brands in rattling volleys fly,<BR>
And all the rustic arms that fury can supply:<BR>
If then some grave and pious man appear,<BR>
They hush their noise, and lend a list'ning ear;<BR>
He soothes with sober words their angry mood,<BR>
And quenches their innate desire of blood:<BR>
So, when the Father of the Flood appears,<BR>
And o'er the seas his sov'reign trident rears,<BR>
Their fury falls: he skims the liquid plains,<BR>
High on his chariot, and, with loosen'd reins,<BR>
Majestic moves along, and awful peace maintains.<BR>
The weary Trojans ply their shatter'd oars<BR>
To nearest land, and make the Libyan shores.</P>
<P>Within a long recess there lies a bay:<BR>
An island shades it from the rolling sea,<BR>
And forms a port secure for ships to ride;<BR>
Broke by the jutting land, on either side,<BR>
In double streams the briny waters glide.<BR>
Betwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene<BR>
Appears above, and groves for ever green:<BR>
A grot is form'd beneath, with mossy seats,<BR>
To rest the Nereids, and exclude the heats.<BR>
Down thro' the crannies of the living walls<BR>
The crystal streams descend in murm'ring falls:<BR>
No haulsers need to bind the vessels here,<BR>
Nor bearded anchors; for no storms they fear.<BR>
Sev'n ships within this happy harbor meet,<BR>
The thin remainders of the scatter'd fleet.<BR>
The Trojans, worn with toils, and spent with woes,<BR>
Leap on the welcome land, and seek their wish'd repose.</P>
<P>First, good Achates, with repeated strokes<BR>
Of clashing flints, their hidden fire provokes:<BR>
Short flame succeeds; a bed of wither'd leaves<BR>
The dying sparkles in their fall receives:<BR>
Caught into life, in fiery fumes they rise,<BR>
And, fed with stronger food, invade the skies.<BR>
The Trojans, dropping wet, or stand around<BR>
The cheerful blaze, or lie along the ground:<BR>
Some dry their corn, infected with the brine,<BR>
Then grind with marbles, and prepare to dine.<BR>
Aeneas climbs the mountain's airy brow,<BR>
And takes a prospect of the seas below,<BR>
If Capys thence, or Antheus he could spy,<BR>
Or see the streamers of Caicus fly.<BR>
No vessels were in view; but, on the plain,<BR>
Three beamy stags command a lordly train<BR>
Of branching heads: the more ignoble throng<BR>
Attend their stately steps, and slowly graze along.<BR>
He stood; and, while secure they fed below,<BR>
He took the quiver and the trusty bow<BR>
Achates us'd to bear: the leaders first<BR>
He laid along, and then the vulgar pierc'd;<BR>
Nor ceas'd his arrows, till the shady plain<BR>
Sev'n mighty bodies with their blood distain.<BR>
For the sev'n ships he made an equal share,<BR>
And to the port return'd, triumphant from the war.<BR>
The jars of gen'rous wine (Acestes' gift,<BR>
When his Trinacrian shores the navy left)<BR>
He set abroach, and for the feast prepar'd,<BR>
In equal portions with the ven'son shar'd.<BR>
Thus while he dealt it round, the pious chief<BR>
With cheerful words allay'd the common grief:<BR>
"Endure, and conquer! Jove will soon dispose<BR>
To future good our past and present woes.<BR>
With me, the rocks of Scylla you have tried;<BR>
Th' inhuman Cyclops and his den defied.<BR>
What greater ills hereafter can you bear?<BR>
Resume your courage and dismiss your care,<BR>
An hour will come, with pleasure to relate<BR>
Your sorrows past, as benefits of Fate.<BR>
Thro' various hazards and events, we move<BR>
To Latium and the realms foredoom'd by Jove.<BR>
Call'd to the seat (the promise of the skies)<BR>
Where Trojan kingdoms once again may rise,<BR>
Endure the hardships of your present state;<BR>
Live, and reserve yourselves for better fate."</P>
<P>These words he spoke, but spoke not from his heart;<BR>
His outward smiles conceal'd his inward smart.<BR>
The jolly crew, unmindful of the past,<BR>
The quarry share, their plenteous dinner haste.<BR>
Some strip the skin; some portion out the spoil;<BR>
The limbs, yet trembling, in the caldrons boil;<BR>
Some on the fire the reeking entrails broil.<BR>
Stretch'd on the grassy turf, at ease they dine,<BR>
Restore their strength with meat, and cheer their souls with<BR>
wine.<BR>
Their hunger thus appeas'd, their care attends<BR>
The doubtful fortune of their absent friends:<BR>
Alternate hopes and fears their minds possess,<BR>
Whether to deem 'em dead, or in distress.<BR>
Above the rest, Aeneas mourns the fate<BR>
Of brave Orontes, and th' uncertain state<BR>
Of Gyas, Lycus, and of Amycus.<BR>
The day, but not their sorrows, ended thus.</P>
<P>When, from aloft, almighty Jove surveys<BR>
Earth, air, and shores, and navigable seas,<BR>
At length on Libyan realms he fix'd his eyes-<BR>
Whom, pond'ring thus on human miseries,<BR>
When Venus saw, she with a lowly look,<BR>
Not free from tears, her heav'nly sire bespoke:</P>
<P>"O King of Gods and Men! whose awful hand<BR>
Disperses thunder on the seas and land,<BR>
Disposing all with absolute command;<BR>
How could my pious son thy pow'r incense?<BR>
Or what, alas! is vanish'd Troy's offense?<BR>
Our hope of Italy not only lost,<BR>
On various seas by various tempests toss'd,<BR>
But shut from ev'ry shore, and barr'd from ev'ry coast.<BR>
You promis'd once, a progeny divine<BR>
Of Romans, rising from the Trojan line,<BR>
In after times should hold the world in awe,<BR>
And to the land and ocean give the law.<BR>
How is your doom revers'd, which eas'd my care<BR>
When Troy was ruin'd in that cruel war?<BR>
Then fates to fates I could oppose; but now,<BR>
When Fortune still pursues her former blow,<BR>
What can I hope? What worse can still succeed?<BR>
What end of labors has your will decreed?<BR>
Antenor, from the midst of Grecian hosts,<BR>
Could pass secure, and pierce th' Illyrian coasts,<BR>
Where, rolling down the steep, Timavus raves<BR>
And thro' nine channels disembogues his waves.<BR>
At length he founded Padua's happy seat,<BR>
And gave his Trojans a secure retreat;<BR>
There fix'd their arms, and there renew'd their name,<BR>
And there in quiet rules, and crown'd with fame.<BR>
But we, descended from your sacred line,<BR>
Entitled to your heav'n and rites divine,<BR>
Are banish'd earth; and, for the wrath of one,<BR>
Remov'd from Latium and the promis'd throne.<BR>
Are these our scepters? these our due rewards?<BR>
And is it thus that Jove his plighted faith regards?"</P>
<P>To whom the Father of th' immortal race,<BR>
Smiling with that serene indulgent face,<BR>
With which he drives the clouds and clears the skies,<BR>
First gave a holy kiss; then thus replies:</P>
<P>"Daughter, dismiss thy fears; to thy desire<BR>
The fates of thine are fix'd, and stand entire.<BR>
Thou shalt behold thy wish'd Lavinian walls;<BR>
And, ripe for heav'n, when fate Aeneas calls,<BR>
Then shalt thou bear him up, sublime, to me:<BR>
No councils have revers'd my firm decree.<BR>
And, lest new fears disturb thy happy state,<BR>
Know, I have search'd the mystic rolls of Fate:<BR>
Thy son (nor is th' appointed season far)<BR>
In Italy shall wage successful war,<BR>
Shall tame fierce nations in the bloody field,<BR>
And sov'reign laws impose, and cities build,<BR>
Till, after ev'ry foe subdued, the sun<BR>
Thrice thro' the signs his annual race shall run:<BR>
This is his time prefix'd. Ascanius then,<BR>
Now call'd Iulus, shall begin his reign.<BR>
He thirty rolling years the crown shall wear,<BR>
Then from Lavinium shall the seat transfer,<BR>
And, with hard labor, Alba Longa build.<BR>
The throne with his succession shall be fill'd<BR>
Three hundred circuits more: then shall be seen<BR>
Ilia the fair, a priestess and a queen,<BR>
Who, full of Mars, in time, with kindly throes,<BR>
Shall at a birth two goodly boys disclose.<BR>
The royal babes a tawny wolf shall drain:<BR>
Then Romulus his grandsire's throne shall gain,<BR>
Of martial tow'rs the founder shall become,<BR>
The people Romans call, the city Rome.<BR>
To them no bounds of empire I assign,<BR>
Nor term of years to their immortal line.<BR>
Ev'n haughty Juno, who, with endless broils,<BR>
Earth, seas, and heav'n, and Jove himself turmoils;<BR>
At length aton'd, her friendly pow'r shall join,<BR>
To cherish and advance the Trojan line.<BR>
The subject world shall Rome's dominion own,<BR>
And, prostrate, shall adore the nation of the gown.<BR>
An age is ripening in revolving fate<BR>
When Troy shall overturn the Grecian state,<BR>
And sweet revenge her conqu'ring sons shall call,<BR>
To crush the people that conspir'd her fall.<BR>
Then Caesar from the Julian stock shall rise,<BR>
Whose empire ocean, and whose fame the skies<BR>
Alone shall bound; whom, fraught with eastern spoils,<BR>
Our heav'n, the just reward of human toils,<BR>
Securely shall repay with rites divine;<BR>
And incense shall ascend before his sacred shrine.<BR>
Then dire debate and impious war shall cease,<BR>
And the stern age be soften'd into peace:<BR>
Then banish'd Faith shall once again return,<BR>
And Vestal fires in hallow'd temples burn;<BR>
And Remus with Quirinus shall sustain<BR>
The righteous laws, and fraud and force restrain.<BR>
Janus himself before his fane shall wait,<BR>
And keep the dreadful issues of his gate,<BR>
With bolts and iron bars: within remains<BR>
Imprison'd Fury, bound in brazen chains;<BR>
High on a trophy rais'd, of useless arms,<BR>
He sits, and threats the world with vain alarms."</P>
<P>He said, and sent Cyllenius with command<BR>
To free the ports, and ope the Punic land<BR>
To Trojan guests; lest, ignorant of fate,<BR>
The queen might force them from her town and state.<BR>
Down from the steep of heav'n Cyllenius flies,<BR>
And cleaves with all his wings the yielding skies.<BR>
Soon on the Libyan shore descends the god,<BR>
Performs his message, and displays his rod:<BR>
The surly murmurs of the people cease;<BR>
And, as the fates requir'd, they give the peace:<BR>
The queen herself suspends the rigid laws,<BR>
The Trojans pities, and protects their cause.</P>
<P>Meantime, in shades of night Aeneas lies:<BR>
Care seiz'd his soul, and sleep forsook his eyes.<BR>
But, when the sun restor'd the cheerful day,<BR>
He rose, the coast and country to survey,<BR>
Anxious and eager to discover more.<BR>
It look'd a wild uncultivated shore;<BR>
But, whether humankind, or beasts alone<BR>
Possess'd the new-found region, was unknown.<BR>
Beneath a ledge of rocks his fleet he hides:<BR>
Tall trees surround the mountain's shady sides;<BR>
The bending brow above a safe retreat provides.<BR>
Arm'd with two pointed darts, he leaves his friends,<BR>
And true Achates on his steps attends.<BR>
Lo! in the deep recesses of the wood,<BR>
Before his eyes his goddess mother stood:<BR>
A huntress in her habit and her mien;<BR>
Her dress a maid, her air confess'd a queen.<BR>
Bare were her knees, and knots her garments bind;<BR>
Loose was her hair, and wanton'd in the wind;<BR>
Her hand sustain'd a bow; her quiver hung behind.<BR>
She seem'd a virgin of the Spartan blood:<BR>
With such array Harpalyce bestrode<BR>
Her Thracian courser and outstripp'd the rapid flood.<BR>
"Ho, strangers! have you lately seen," she said,<BR>
"One of my sisters, like myself array'd,<BR>
Who cross'd the lawn, or in the forest stray'd?<BR>
A painted quiver at her back she bore;<BR>
Varied with spots, a lynx's hide she wore;<BR>
And at full cry pursued the tusky boar."</P>
<P>Thus Venus: thus her son replied again:<BR>
"None of your sisters have we heard or seen,<BR>
O virgin! or what other name you bear<BR>
Above that style- O more than mortal fair!<BR>
Your voice and mien celestial birth betray!<BR>
If, as you seem, the sister of the day,<BR>
Or one at least of chaste Diana's train,<BR>
Let not an humble suppliant sue in vain;<BR>
But tell a stranger, long in tempests toss'd,<BR>
What earth we tread, and who commands the coast?<BR>
Then on your name shall wretched mortals call,<BR>
And offer'd victims at your altars fall."<BR>
"I dare not," she replied, "assume the name<BR>
Of goddess, or celestial honors claim:<BR>
For Tyrian virgins bows and quivers bear,<BR>
And purple buskins o'er their ankles wear.<BR>
Know, gentle youth, in Libyan lands you are-<BR>
A people rude in peace, and rough in war.<BR>
The rising city, which from far you see,<BR>
Is Carthage, and a Tyrian colony.<BR>
Phoenician Dido rules the growing state,<BR>
Who fled from Tyre, to shun her brother's hate.<BR>
Great were her wrongs, her story full of fate;<BR>
Which I will sum in short. Sichaeus, known<BR>
For wealth, and brother to the Punic throne,<BR>
Possess'd fair Dido's bed; and either heart<BR>
At once was wounded with an equal dart.<BR>
Her father gave her, yet a spotless maid;<BR>
Pygmalion then the Tyrian scepter sway'd:<BR>
One who condemn'd divine and human laws.<BR>
Then strife ensued, and cursed gold the cause.<BR>
The monarch, blinded with desire of wealth,<BR>
With steel invades his brother's life by stealth;<BR>
Before the sacred altar made him bleed,<BR>
And long from her conceal'd the cruel deed.<BR>
Some tale, some new pretense, he daily coin'd,<BR>
To soothe his sister, and delude her mind.<BR>
At length, in dead of night, the ghost appears<BR>
Of her unhappy lord: the specter stares,<BR>
And, with erected eyes, his bloody bosom bares.<BR>
The cruel altars and his fate he tells,<BR>
And the dire secret of his house reveals,<BR>
Then warns the widow, with her household gods,<BR>
To seek a refuge in remote abodes.<BR>
Last, to support her in so long a way,<BR>
He shows her where his hidden treasure lay.<BR>
Admonish'd thus, and seiz'd with mortal fright,<BR>
The queen provides companions of her flight:<BR>
They meet, and all combine to leave the state,<BR>
Who hate the tyrant, or who fear his hate.<BR>
They seize a fleet, which ready rigg'd they find;<BR>
Nor is Pygmalion's treasure left behind.<BR>
The vessels, heavy laden, put to sea<BR>
With prosp'rous winds; a woman leads the way.<BR>
I know not, if by stress of weather driv'n,<BR>
Or was their fatal course dispos'd by Heav'n;<BR>
At last they landed, where from far your eyes<BR>
May view the turrets of new Carthage rise;<BR>
There bought a space of ground, which (Byrsa call'd,<BR>
From the bull's hide) they first inclos'd, and wall'd.<BR>
But whence are you? what country claims your birth?<BR>
What seek you, strangers, on our Libyan earth?"</P>
<P>To whom, with sorrow streaming from his eyes,<BR>
And deeply sighing, thus her son replies:<BR>
"Could you with patience hear, or I relate,<BR>
O nymph, the tedious annals of our fate!<BR>
Thro' such a train of woes if I should run,<BR>
The day would sooner than the tale be done!<BR>
From ancient Troy, by force expell'd, we came-<BR>
If you by chance have heard the Trojan name.<BR>
On various seas by various tempests toss'd,<BR>
At length we landed on your Libyan coast.<BR>
The good Aeneas am I call'd- a name,<BR>
While Fortune favor'd, not unknown to fame.<BR>
My household gods, companions of my woes,<BR>
With pious care I rescued from our foes.<BR>
To fruitful Italy my course was bent;<BR>
And from the King of Heav'n is my descent.<BR>
With twice ten sail I cross'd the Phrygian sea;<BR>
Fate and my mother goddess led my way.<BR>
Scarce sev'n, the thin remainders of my fleet,<BR>
From storms preserv'd, within your harbor meet.<BR>
Myself distress'd, an exile, and unknown,<BR>
Debarr'd from Europe, and from Asia thrown,<BR>
In Libyan desarts wander thus alone."</P>
<P>His tender parent could no longer bear;<BR>
But, interposing, sought to soothe his care.<BR>
"Whoe'er you are- not unbelov'd by Heav'n,<BR>
Since on our friendly shore your ships are driv'n-<BR>
Have courage: to the gods permit the rest,<BR>
And to the queen expose your just request.<BR>
Now take this earnest of success, for more:<BR>
Your scatter'd fleet is join'd upon the shore;<BR>
The winds are chang'd, your friends from danger free;<BR>
Or I renounce my skill in augury.<BR>
Twelve swans behold in beauteous order move,<BR>
And stoop with closing pinions from above;<BR>
Whom late the bird of Jove had driv'n along,<BR>
And thro' the clouds pursued the scatt'ring throng:<BR>
Now, all united in a goodly team,<BR>
They skim the ground, and seek the quiet stream.<BR>
As they, with joy returning, clap their wings,<BR>
And ride the circuit of the skies in rings;<BR>
Not otherwise your ships, and ev'ry friend,<BR>
Already hold the port, or with swift sails descend.<BR>
No more advice is needful; but pursue<BR>
The path before you, and the town in view."</P>
<P>Thus having said, she turn'd, and made appear<BR>
Her neck refulgent, and dishevel'd hair,<BR>
Which, flowing from her shoulders, reach'd the ground.<BR>
And widely spread ambrosial scents around:<BR>
In length of train descends her sweeping gown;<BR>
And, by her graceful walk, the Queen of Love is known.<BR>
The prince pursued the parting deity<BR>
With words like these: "Ah! whither do you fly?<BR>
Unkind and cruel! to deceive your son<BR>
In borrow'd shapes, and his embrace to shun;<BR>
Never to bless my sight, but thus unknown;<BR>
And still to speak in accents not your own."<BR>
Against the goddess these complaints he made,<BR>
But took the path, and her commands obey'd.<BR>
They march, obscure; for Venus kindly shrouds<BR>
With mists their persons, and involves in clouds,<BR>
That, thus unseen, their passage none might stay,<BR>
Or force to tell the causes of their way.<BR>
This part perform'd, the goddess flies sublime<BR>
To visit Paphos and her native clime;<BR>
Where garlands, ever green and ever fair,<BR>
With vows are offer'd, and with solemn pray'r:<BR>
A hundred altars in her temple smoke;<BR>
A thousand bleeding hearts her pow'r invoke.</P>
<P>They climb the next ascent, and, looking down,<BR>
Now at a nearer distance view the town.<BR>
The prince with wonder sees the stately tow'rs,<BR>
Which late were huts and shepherds' homely bow'rs,<BR>
The gates and streets; and hears, from ev'ry part,<BR>
The noise and busy concourse of the mart.<BR>
The toiling Tyrians on each other call<BR>
To ply their labor: some extend the wall;<BR>
Some build the citadel; the brawny throng<BR>
Or dig, or push unwieldly stones along.<BR>
Some for their dwellings choose a spot of ground,<BR>
Which, first design'd, with ditches they surround.<BR>
Some laws ordain; and some attend the choice<BR>
Of holy senates, and elect by voice.<BR>
Here some design a mole, while others there<BR>
Lay deep foundations for a theater;<BR>
From marble quarries mighty columns hew,<BR>
For ornaments of scenes, and future view.<BR>
Such is their toil, and such their busy pains,<BR>
As exercise the bees in flow'ry plains,<BR>
When winter past, and summer scarce begun,<BR>
Invites them forth to labor in the sun;<BR>
Some lead their youth abroad, while some condense<BR>
Their liquid store, and some in cells dispense;<BR>
Some at the gate stand ready to receive<BR>
The golden burthen, and their friends relieve;<BR>
All with united force, combine to drive<BR>
The lazy drones from the laborious hive:<BR>
With envy stung, they view each other's deeds;<BR>
The fragrant work with diligence proceeds.<BR>
"Thrice happy you, whose walls already rise!"<BR>
Aeneas said, and view'd, with lifted eyes,<BR>
Their lofty tow'rs; then, entiring at the gate,<BR>
Conceal'd in clouds (prodigious to relate)<BR>
He mix'd, unmark'd, among the busy throng,<BR>
Borne by the tide, and pass'd unseen along.</P>
<P>Full in the center of the town there stood,<BR>
Thick set with trees, a venerable wood.<BR>
The Tyrians, landing near this holy ground,<BR>
And digging here, a prosp'rous omen found:<BR>
From under earth a courser's head they drew,<BR>
Their growth and future fortune to foreshew.<BR>
This fated sign their foundress Juno gave,<BR>
Of a soil fruitful, and a people brave.<BR>
Sidonian Dido here with solemn state<BR>
Did Juno's temple build, and consecrate,<BR>
Enrich'd with gifts, and with a golden shrine;<BR>
But more the goddess made the place divine.<BR>
On brazen steps the marble threshold rose,<BR>
And brazen plates the cedar beams inclose:<BR>
The rafters are with brazen cov'rings crown'd;<BR>
The lofty doors on brazen hinges sound.<BR>
What first Aeneas this place beheld,<BR>
Reviv'd his courage, and his fear expell'd.<BR>
For while, expecting there the queen, he rais'd<BR>
His wond'ring eyes, and round the temple gaz'd,<BR>
Admir'd the fortune of the rising town,<BR>
The striving artists, and their arts' renown;<BR>
He saw, in order painted on the wall,<BR>
Whatever did unhappy Troy befall:<BR>
The wars that fame around the world had blown,<BR>
All to the life, and ev'ry leader known.<BR>
There Agamemnon, Priam here, he spies,<BR>
And fierce Achilles, who both kings defies.<BR>
He stopp'd, and weeping said: "O friend! ev'n here<BR>
The monuments of Trojan woes appear!<BR>
Our known disasters fill ev'n foreign lands:<BR>
See there, where old unhappy Priam stands!<BR>
Ev'n the mute walls relate the warrior's fame,<BR>
And Trojan griefs the Tyrians' pity claim."<BR>
He said (his tears a ready passage find),<BR>
Devouring what he saw so well design'd,<BR>
And with an empty picture fed his mind:<BR>
For there he saw the fainting Grecians yield,<BR>
And here the trembling Trojans quit the field,<BR>
Pursued by fierce Achilles thro' the plain,<BR>
On his high chariot driving o'er the slain.<BR>
The tents of Rhesus next his grief renew,<BR>
By their white sails betray'd to nightly view;<BR>
And wakeful Diomede, whose cruel sword<BR>
The sentries slew, nor spar'd their slumb'ring lord,<BR>
Then took the fiery steeds, ere yet the food<BR>
Of Troy they taste, or drink the Xanthian flood.<BR>
Elsewhere he saw where Troilus defied<BR>
Achilles, and unequal combat tried;<BR>
Then, where the boy disarm'd, with loosen'd reins,<BR>
Was by his horses hurried o'er the plains,<BR>
Hung by the neck and hair, and dragg'd around:<BR>
The hostile spear, yet sticking in his wound,<BR>
With tracks of blood inscrib'd the dusty ground.<BR>
Meantime the Trojan dames, oppress'd with woe,<BR>
To Pallas' fane in long procession go,<BR>
In hopes to reconcile their heav'nly foe.<BR>
They weep, they beat their breasts, they rend their hair,<BR>
And rich embroider'd vests for presents bear;<BR>
But the stern goddess stands unmov'd with pray'r.<BR>
Thrice round the Trojan walls Achilles drew<BR>
The corpse of Hector, whom in fight he slew.<BR>
Here Priam sues; and there, for sums of gold,<BR>
The lifeless body of his son is sold.<BR>
So sad an object, and so well express'd,<BR>
Drew sighs and groans from the griev'd hero's breast,<BR>
To see the figure of his lifeless friend,<BR>
And his old sire his helpless hand extend.<BR>
Himself he saw amidst the Grecian train,<BR>
Mix'd in the bloody battle on the plain;<BR>
And swarthy Memnon in his arms he knew,<BR>
His pompous ensigns, and his Indian crew.<BR>
Penthisilea there, with haughty grace,<BR>
Leads to the wars an Amazonian race:<BR>
In their right hands a pointed dart they wield;<BR>
The left, for ward, sustains the lunar shield.<BR>
Athwart her breast a golden belt she throws,<BR>
Amidst the press alone provokes a thousand foes,<BR>
And dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose.</P>
<P>Thus while the Trojan prince employs his eyes,<BR>
Fix'd on the walls with wonder and surprise,<BR>
The beauteous Dido, with a num'rous train<BR>
And pomp of guards, ascends the sacred fane.<BR>
Such on Eurotas' banks, or Cynthus' height,<BR>
Diana seems; and so she charms the sight,<BR>
When in the dance the graceful goddess leads<BR>
The choir of nymphs, and overtops their heads:<BR>
Known by her quiver, and her lofty mien,<BR>
She walks majestic, and she looks their queen;<BR>
Latona sees her shine above the rest,<BR>
And feeds with secret joy her silent breast.<BR>
Such Dido was; with such becoming state,<BR>
Amidst the crowd, she walks serenely great.<BR>
Their labor to her future sway she speeds,<BR>
And passing with a gracious glance proceeds;<BR>
Then mounts the throne, high plac'd before the shrine:<BR>
In crowds around, the swarming people join.<BR>
She takes petitions, and dispenses laws,<BR>
Hears and determines ev'ry private cause;<BR>
Their tasks in equal portions she divides,<BR>
And, where unequal, there by lots decides.<BR>
Another way by chance Aeneas bends<BR>
His eyes, and unexpected sees his friends,<BR>
Antheus, Sergestus grave, Cloanthus strong,<BR>
And at their backs a mighty Trojan throng,<BR>
Whom late the tempest on the billows toss'd,<BR>
And widely scatter'd on another coast.<BR>
The prince, unseen, surpris'd with wonder stands,<BR>
And longs, with joyful haste, to join their hands;<BR>
But, doubtful of the wish'd event, he stays,<BR>
And from the hollow cloud his friends surveys,<BR>
Impatient till they told their present state,<BR>
And where they left their ships, and what their fate,<BR>
And why they came, and what was their request;<BR>
For these were sent, commission'd by the rest,<BR>
To sue for leave to land their sickly men,<BR>
And gain admission to the gracious queen.<BR>
Ent'ring, with cries they fill'd the holy fane;<BR>
Then thus, with lowly voice, Ilioneus began:</P>
<P>"O queen! indulg'd by favor of the gods<BR>
To found an empire in these new abodes,<BR>
To build a town, with statutes to restrain<BR>
The wild inhabitants beneath thy reign,<BR>
We wretched Trojans, toss'd on ev'ry shore,<BR>
From sea to sea, thy clemency implore.<BR>
Forbid the fires our shipping to deface!<BR>
Receive th' unhappy fugitives to grace,<BR>
And spare the remnant of a pious race!<BR>
We come not with design of wasteful prey,<BR>
To drive the country, force the swains away:<BR>
Nor such our strength, nor such is our desire;<BR>
The vanquish'd dare not to such thoughts aspire.<BR>
A land there is, Hesperia nam'd of old;<BR>
The soil is fruitful, and the men are bold-<BR>
Th' Oenotrians held it once- by common fame<BR>
Now call'd Italia, from the leader's name.<BR>
To that sweet region was our voyage bent,<BR>
When winds and ev'ry warring element<BR>
Disturb'd our course, and, far from sight of land,<BR>
Cast our torn vessels on the moving sand:<BR>
The sea came on; the South, with mighty roar,<BR>
Dispers'd and dash'd the rest upon the rocky shore.<BR>
Those few you see escap'd the Storm, and fear,<BR>
Unless you interpose, a shipwreck here.<BR>
What men, what monsters, what inhuman race,<BR>
What laws, what barb'rous customs of the place,<BR>
Shut up a desart shore to drowning men,<BR>
And drive us to the cruel seas again?<BR>
If our hard fortune no compassion draws,<BR>
Nor hospitable rights, nor human laws,<BR>
The gods are just, and will revenge our cause.<BR>
Aeneas was our prince: a juster lord,<BR>
Or nobler warrior, never drew a sword;<BR>
Observant of the right, religious of his word.<BR>
If yet he lives, and draws this vital air,<BR>
Nor we, his friends, of safety shall despair;<BR>
Nor you, great queen, these offices repent,<BR>
Which he will equal, and perhaps augment.<BR>
We want not cities, nor Sicilian coasts,<BR>
Where King Acestes Trojan lineage boasts.<BR>
Permit our ships a shelter on your shores,<BR>
Refitted from your woods with planks and oars,<BR>
That, if our prince be safe, we may renew<BR>
Our destin'd course, and Italy pursue.<BR>
But if, O best of men, the Fates ordain<BR>
That thou art swallow'd in the Libyan main,<BR>
And if our young Iulus be no more,<BR>
Dismiss our navy from your friendly shore,<BR>
That we to good Acestes may return,<BR>
And with our friends our common losses mourn."<BR>
Thus spoke Ilioneus: the Trojan crew<BR>
With cries and clamors his request renew.</P>
<P>The modest queen a while, with downcast eyes,<BR>
Ponder'd the speech; then briefly thus replies:<BR>
"Trojans, dismiss your fears; my cruel fate,<BR>
And doubts attending an unsettled state,<BR>
Force me to guard my coast from foreign foes.<BR>
Who has not heard the story of your woes,<BR>
The name and fortune of your native place,<BR>
The fame and valor of the Phrygian race?<BR>
We Tyrians are not so devoid of sense,<BR>
Nor so remote from Phoebus' influence.<BR>
Whether to Latian shores your course is bent,<BR>
Or, driv'n by tempests from your first intent,<BR>
You seek the good Acestes' government,<BR>
Your men shall be receiv'd, your fleet repair'd,<BR>
And sail, with ships of convoy for your guard:<BR>
Or, would you stay, and join your friendly pow'rs<BR>
To raise and to defend the Tyrian tow'rs,<BR>
My wealth, my city, and myself are yours.<BR>
And would to Heav'n, the Storm, you felt, would bring<BR>
On Carthaginian coasts your wand'ring king.<BR>
My people shall, by my command, explore<BR>
The ports and creeks of ev'ry winding shore,<BR>
And towns, and wilds, and shady woods, in quest<BR>
Of so renown'd and so desir'd a guest."</P>
<P>Rais'd in his mind the Trojan hero stood,<BR>
And long'd to break from out his ambient cloud:<BR>
Achates found it, and thus urg'd his way:<BR>
"From whence, O goddess-born, this long delay?<BR>
What more can you desire, your welcome sure,<BR>
Your fleet in safety, and your friends secure?<BR>
One only wants; and him we saw in vain<BR>
Oppose the Storm, and swallow'd in the main.<BR>
Orontes in his fate our forfeit paid;<BR>
The rest agrees with what your mother said."<BR>
Scarce had he spoken, when the cloud gave way,<BR>
The mists flew upward and dissolv'd in day.</P>
<P>The Trojan chief appear'd in open sight,<BR>
August in visage, and serenely bright.<BR>
His mother goddess, with her hands divine,<BR>
Had form'd his curling locks, and made his temples shine,<BR>
And giv'n his rolling eyes a sparkling grace,<BR>
And breath'd a youthful vigor on his face;<BR>
Like polish'd ivory, beauteous to behold,<BR>
Or Parian marble, when enchas'd in gold:<BR>
Thus radiant from the circling cloud he broke,<BR>
And thus with manly modesty he spoke:</P>
<P>"He whom you seek am I; by tempests toss'd,<BR>
And sav'd from shipwreck on your Libyan coast;<BR>
Presenting, gracious queen, before your throne,<BR>
A prince that owes his life to you alone.<BR>
Fair majesty, the refuge and redress<BR>
Of those whom fate pursues, and wants oppress,<BR>
You, who your pious offices employ<BR>
To save the relics of abandon'd Troy;<BR>
Receive the shipwreck'd on your friendly shore,<BR>
With hospitable rites relieve the poor;<BR>
Associate in your town a wand'ring train,<BR>
And strangers in your palace entertain:<BR>
What thanks can wretched fugitives return,<BR>
Who, scatter'd thro' the world, in exile mourn?<BR>
The gods, if gods to goodness are inclin'd;<BR>
If acts of mercy touch their heav'nly mind,<BR>
And, more than all the gods, your gen'rous heart.<BR>
Conscious of worth, requite its own desert!<BR>
In you this age is happy, and this earth,<BR>
And parents more than mortal gave you birth.<BR>
While rolling rivers into seas shall run,<BR>
And round the space of heav'n the radiant sun;<BR>
While trees the mountain tops with shades supply,<BR>
Your honor, name, and praise shall never die.<BR>
Whate'er abode my fortune has assign'd,<BR>
Your image shall be present in my mind."<BR>
Thus having said, he turn'd with pious haste,<BR>
And joyful his expecting friends embrac'd:<BR>
With his right hand Ilioneus was grac'd,<BR>
Serestus with his left; then to his breast<BR>
Cloanthus and the noble Gyas press'd;<BR>
And so by turns descended to the rest.</P>
<P>The Tyrian queen stood fix'd upon his face,<BR>
Pleas'd with his motions, ravish'd with his grace;<BR>
Admir'd his fortunes, more admir'd the man;<BR>
Then recollected stood, and thus began:<BR>
"What fate, O goddess-born; what angry pow'rs<BR>
Have cast you shipwrack'd on our barren shores?<BR>
Are you the great Aeneas, known to fame,<BR>
Who from celestial seed your lineage claim?</P>
<P>The same Aeneas whom fair Venus bore<BR>
To fam'd Anchises on th' Idaean shore?<BR>
It calls into my mind, tho' then a child,<BR>
When Teucer came, from Salamis exil'd,<BR>
And sought my father's aid, to be restor'd:<BR>
My father Belus then with fire and sword<BR>
Invaded Cyprus, made the region bare,<BR>
And, conqu'ring, finish'd the successful war.<BR>
From him the Trojan siege I understood,<BR>
The Grecian chiefs, and your illustrious blood.<BR>
Your foe himself the Dardan valor prais'd,<BR>
And his own ancestry from Trojans rais'd.<BR>
Enter, my noble guest, and you shall find,<BR>
If not a costly welcome, yet a kind:<BR>
For I myself, like you, have been distress'd,<BR>
Till Heav'n afforded me this place of rest;<BR>
Like you, an alien in a land unknown,<BR>
I learn to pity woes so like my own."<BR>
She said, and to the palace led her guest;<BR>
Then offer'd incense, and proclaim'd a feast.<BR>
Nor yet less careful for her absent friends,<BR>
Twice ten fat oxen to the ships she sends;<BR>
Besides a hundred boars, a hundred lambs,<BR>
With bleating cries, attend their milky dams;<BR>
And jars of gen'rous wine and spacious bowls<BR>
She gives, to cheer the sailors' drooping souls.<BR>
Now purple hangings clothe the palace walls,<BR>
And sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls:<BR>
On Tyrian carpets, richly wrought, they dine;<BR>
With loads of massy plate the sideboards shine,<BR>
And antique vases, all of gold emboss'd<BR>
(The gold itself inferior to the cost),<BR>
Of curious work, where on the sides were seen<BR>
The fights and figures of illustrious men,<BR>
From their first founder to the present queen.</P>
<P>The good Aeneas, paternal care<BR>
Iulus' absence could no longer bear,<BR>
Dispatch'd Achates to the ships in haste,<BR>
To give a glad relation of the past,<BR>
And, fraught with precious gifts, to bring the boy,<BR>
Snatch'd from the ruins of unhappy Troy:<BR>
A robe of tissue, stiff with golden wire;<BR>
An upper vest, once Helen's rich attire,<BR>
From Argos by the fam'd adultress brought,<BR>
With golden flow'rs and winding foliage wrought,<BR>
Her mother Leda's present, when she came<BR>
To ruin Troy and set the world on flame;<BR>
The scepter Priam's eldest daughter bore,<BR>
Her orient necklace, and the crown she wore<BR>
Of double texture, glorious to behold,<BR>
One order set with gems, and one with gold.<BR>
Instructed thus, the wise Achates goes,<BR>
And in his diligence his duty shows.</P>
<P>But Venus, anxious for her son's affairs,<BR>
New counsels tries, and new designs prepares:<BR>
That Cupid should assume the shape and face<BR>
Of sweet Ascanius, and the sprightly grace;<BR>
Should bring the presents, in her nephew's stead,<BR>
And in Eliza's veins the gentle poison shed:<BR>
For much she fear'd the Tyrians, double-tongued,<BR>
And knew the town to Juno's care belong'd.<BR>
These thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke,<BR>
And thus alarm'd, to winged Love she spoke:<BR>
"My son, my strength, whose mighty pow'r alone<BR>
Controls the Thund'rer on his awful throne,<BR>
To thee thy much-afflicted mother flies,<BR>
And on thy succor and thy faith relies.<BR>
Thou know'st, my son, how Jove's revengeful wife,<BR>
By force and fraud, attempts thy brother's life;<BR>
And often hast thou mourn'd with me his pains.<BR>
Him Dido now with blandishment detains;<BR>
But I suspect the town where Juno reigns.<BR>
For this 't is needful to prevent her art,<BR>
And fire with love the proud Phoenician's heart:<BR>
A love so violent, so strong, so sure,<BR>
As neither age can change, nor art can cure.<BR>
How this may be perform'd, now take my mind:<BR>
Ascanius by his father is design'd<BR>
To come, with presents laden, from the port,<BR>
To gratify the queen, and gain the court.<BR>
I mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep,<BR>
And, ravish'd, in Idalian bow'rs to keep,<BR>
Or high Cythera, that the sweet deceit<BR>
May pass unseen, and none prevent the cheat.<BR>
Take thou his form and shape. I beg the grace<BR>
But only for a night's revolving space:<BR>
Thyself a boy, assume a boy's dissembled face;<BR>
That when, amidst the fervor of the feast,<BR>
The Tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast,<BR>
And with sweet kisses in her arms constrains,<BR>
Thou may'st infuse thy venom in her veins."<BR>
The God of Love obeys, and sets aside<BR>
His bow and quiver, and his plumy pride;<BR>
He walks Iulus in his mother's sight,<BR>
And in the sweet resemblance takes delight.</P>
<P>The goddess then to young Ascanius flies,<BR>
And in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes:<BR>
Lull'd in her lap, amidst a train of Loves,<BR>
She gently bears him to her blissful groves,<BR>
Then with a wreath of myrtle crowns his head,<BR>
And softly lays him on a flow'ry bed.<BR>
Cupid meantime assum'd his form and face,<BR>
Foll'wing Achates with a shorter pace,<BR>
And brought the gifts. The queen already sate<BR>
Amidst the Trojan lords, in shining state,<BR>
High on a golden bed: her princely guest<BR>
Was next her side; in order sate the rest.<BR>
Then canisters with bread are heap'd on high;<BR>
Th' attendants water for their hands supply,<BR>
And, having wash'd, with silken towels dry.<BR>
Next fifty handmaids in long order bore<BR>
The censers, and with fumes the gods adore:<BR>
Then youths, and virgins twice as many, join<BR>
To place the dishes, and to serve the wine.<BR>
The Tyrian train, admitted to the feast,<BR>
Approach, and on the painted couches rest.<BR>
All on the Trojan gifts with wonder gaze,<BR>
But view the beauteous boy with more amaze,<BR>
His rosy-color'd cheeks, his radiant eyes,<BR>
His motions, voice, and shape, and all the god's disguise;<BR>
Nor pass unprais'd the vest and veil divine,<BR>
Which wand'ring foliage and rich flow'rs entwine.<BR>
But, far above the rest, the royal dame,<BR>
(Already doom'd to love's disastrous flame,)<BR>
With eyes insatiate, and tumultuous joy,<BR>
Beholds the presents, and admires the boy.<BR>
The guileful god about the hero long,<BR>
With children's play, and false embraces, hung;<BR>
Then sought the queen: she took him to her arms<BR>
With greedy pleasure, and devour'd his charms.<BR>
Unhappy Dido little thought what guest,<BR>
How dire a god, she drew so near her breast;<BR>
But he, not mindless of his mother's pray'r,<BR>
Works in the pliant bosom of the fair,<BR>
And molds her heart anew, and blots her former care.<BR>
The dead is to the living love resign'd;<BR>
And all Aeneas enters in her mind.</P>
<P>Now, when the rage of hunger was appeas'd,<BR>
The meat remov'd, and ev'ry guest was pleas'd,<BR>
The golden bowls with sparkling wine are crown'd,<BR>
And thro' the palace cheerful cries resound.<BR>
From gilded roofs depending lamps display<BR>
Nocturnal beams, that emulate the day.<BR>
A golden bowl, that shone with gems divine,<BR>
The queen commanded to be crown'd with wine:<BR>
The bowl that Belus us'd, and all the Tyrian line.<BR>
Then, silence thro' the hall proclaim'd, she spoke:<BR>
"O hospitable Jove! we thus invoke,<BR>
With solemn rites, thy sacred name and pow'r;<BR>
Bless to both nations this auspicious hour!<BR>
So may the Trojan and the Tyrian line<BR>
In lasting concord from this day combine.<BR>
Thou, Bacchus, god of joys and friendly cheer,<BR>
And gracious Juno, both be present here!<BR>
And you, my lords of Tyre, your vows address<BR>
To Heav'n with mine, to ratify the peace."<BR>
The goblet then she took, with nectar crown'd<BR>
(Sprinkling the first libations on the ground,)<BR>
And rais'd it to her mouth with sober grace;<BR>
Then, sipping, offer'd to the next in place.<BR>
'T was Bitias whom she call'd, a thirsty soul;<BR>
He took challenge, and embrac'd the bowl,<BR>
With pleasure swill'd the gold, nor ceas'd to draw,<BR>
Till he the bottom of the brimmer saw.<BR>
The goblet goes around: Iopas brought<BR>
His golden lyre, and sung what ancient Atlas taught:<BR>
The various labors of the wand'ring moon,<BR>
And whence proceed th' eclipses of the sun;<BR>
Th' original of men and beasts; and whence<BR>
The rains arise, and fires their warmth dispense,<BR>
And fix'd and erring stars dispose their influence;<BR>
What shakes the solid earth; what cause delays<BR>
The summer nights and shortens winter days.<BR>
With peals of shouts the Tyrians praise the song:<BR>
Those peals are echo'd by the Trojan throng.<BR>
Th' unhappy queen with talk prolong'd the night,<BR>
And drank large draughts of love with vast delight;<BR>
Of Priam much enquir'd, of Hector more;<BR>
Then ask'd what arms the swarthy Memnon wore,<BR>
What troops he landed on the Trojan shore;<BR>
The steeds of Diomede varied the discourse,<BR>
And fierce Achilles, with his matchless force;<BR>
At length, as fate and her ill stars requir'd,<BR>
To hear the series of the war desir'd.<BR>
"Relate at large, my godlike guest," she said,<BR>
"The Grecian stratagems, the town betray'd:<BR>
The fatal issue of so long a war,<BR>
Your flight, your wand'rings, and your woes, declare;<BR>
For, since on ev'ry sea, on ev'ry coast,<BR>
Your men have been distress'd, your navy toss'd,<BR>
Sev'n times the sun has either tropic view'd,<BR>
The winter banish'd, and the spring renew'd."</P>
