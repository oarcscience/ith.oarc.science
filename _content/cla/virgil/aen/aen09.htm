<P>While these affairs in distant places pass'd,<BR>
The various Iris Juno sends with haste,<BR>
To find bold Turnus, who, with anxious thought,<BR>
The secret shade of his great grandsire sought.<BR>
Retir'd alone she found the daring man,<BR>
And op'd her rosy lips, and thus began:<BR>
"What none of all the gods could grant thy vows,<BR>
That, Turnus, this auspicious day bestows.<BR>
Aeneas, gone to seek th' Arcadian prince,<BR>
Has left the Trojan camp without defense;<BR>
And, short of succors there, employs his pains<BR>
In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains.<BR>
Now snatch an hour that favors thy designs;<BR>
Unite thy forces, and attack their lines."<BR>
This said, on equal wings she pois'd her weight,<BR>
And form'd a radiant rainbow in her flight.</P>
<P>The Daunian hero lifts his hands eyes,<BR>
And thus invokes the goddess as she flies:<BR>
"Iris, the grace of heav'n, what pow'r divine<BR>
Has sent thee down, thro' dusky clouds to shine?<BR>
See, they divide; immortal day appears,<BR>
And glitt'ring planets dancing in their spheres!<BR>
With joy, these happy omens I obey,<BR>
And follow to the war the god that leads the way."<BR>
Thus having said, as by the brook he stood,<BR>
He scoop'd the water from the crystal flood;<BR>
Then with his hands the drops to heav'n he throws,<BR>
And loads the pow'rs above with offer'd vows.</P>
<P>Now march the bold confed'rates thro' the plain,<BR>
Well hors'd, well clad; a rich and shining train.<BR>
Messapus leads the van; and, in the rear,<BR>
The sons of Tyrrheus in bright arms appear.<BR>
In the main battle, with his flaming crest,<BR>
The mighty Turnus tow'rs above the rest.<BR>
Silent they move, majestically slow,<BR>
Like ebbing Nile, or Ganges in his flow.<BR>
The Trojans view the dusty cloud from far,<BR>
And the dark menace of the distant war.<BR>
Caicus from the rampire saw it rise,<BR>
Black'ning the fields, and thick'ning thro' the skies.<BR>
Then to his fellows thus aloud he calls:<BR>
"What rolling clouds, my friends, approach the walls?<BR>
Arm! arm! and man the works! prepare your spears<BR>
And pointed darts! the Latian host appears."</P>
<P>Thus warn'd, they shut their gates; with shouts ascend<BR>
The bulwarks, and, secure, their foes attend:<BR>
For their wise gen'ral, with foreseeing care,<BR>
Had charg'd them not to tempt the doubtful war,<BR>
Nor, tho' provok'd, in open fields advance,<BR>
But close within their lines attend their chance.<BR>
Unwilling, yet they keep the strict command,<BR>
And sourly wait in arms the hostile band.<BR>
The fiery Turnus flew before the rest:<BR>
A piebald steed of Thracian strain he press'd;<BR>
His helm of massy gold, and crimson was his crest.<BR>
With twenty horse to second his designs,<BR>
An unexpected foe, he fac'd the lines.<BR>
"Is there," he said, "in arms, who bravely dare<BR>
His leader's honor and his danger share?"<BR>
Then spurring on, his brandish'd dart he threw,<BR>
In sign of war: applauding shouts ensue.</P>
<P>Amaz'd to find a dastard race, that run<BR>
Behind the rampires and the battle shun,<BR>
He rides around the camp, with rolling eyes,<BR>
And stops at ev'ry post, and ev'ry passage tries.<BR>
So roams the nightly wolf about the fold:<BR>
Wet with descending show'rs, and stiff with cold,<BR>
He howls for hunger, and he grins for pain,<BR>
(His gnashing teeth are exercis'd in vain,)<BR>
And, impotent of anger, finds no way<BR>
In his distended paws to grasp the prey.<BR>
The mothers listen; but the bleating lambs<BR>
Securely swig the dug, beneath the dams.<BR>
Thus ranges eager Turnus o'er the plain.<BR>
Sharp with desire, and furious with disdain;<BR>
Surveys each passage with a piercing sight,<BR>
To force his foes in equal field to fight.<BR>
Thus while he gazes round, at length he spies,<BR>
Where, fenc'd with strong redoubts, their navy lies,<BR>
Close underneath the walls; the washing tide<BR>
Secures from all approach this weaker side.<BR>
He takes the wish'd occasion, fills his hand<BR>
With ready fires, and shakes a flaming brand.<BR>
Urg'd by his presence, ev'ry soul is warm'd,<BR>
And ev'ry hand with kindled firs is arm'd.<BR>
From the fir'd pines the scatt'ring sparkles fly;<BR>
Fat vapors, mix'd with flames, involve the sky.<BR>
What pow'r, O Muses, could avert the flame<BR>
Which threaten'd, in the fleet, the Trojan name?<BR>
Tell: for the fact, thro' length of time obscure,<BR>
Is hard to faith; yet shall the fame endure.</P>
<P>'T is said that, when the chief prepar'd his flight,<BR>
And fell'd his timber from Mount Ida's height,<BR>
The grandam goddess then approach'd her son,<BR>
And with a mother's majesty begun:<BR>
"Grant me," she said, "the sole request I bring,<BR>
Since conquer'd heav'n has own'd you for its king.<BR>
On Ida's brows, for ages past, there stood,<BR>
With firs and maples fill'd, a shady wood;<BR>
And on the summit rose a sacred grove,<BR>
Where I was worship'd with religious love.<BR>
Those woods, that holy grove, my long delight,<BR>
I gave the Trojan prince, to speed his flight.<BR>
Now, fill'd with fear, on their behalf I come;<BR>
Let neither winds o'erset, nor waves intomb<BR>
The floating forests of the sacred pine;<BR>
But let it be their safety to be mine."<BR>
Then thus replied her awful son, who rolls<BR>
The radiant stars, and heav'n and earth controls:<BR>
"How dare you, mother, endless date demand<BR>
For vessels molded by a mortal hand?<BR>
What then is fate? Shall bold Aeneas ride,<BR>
Of safety certain, on th' uncertain tide?<BR>
Yet, what I can, I grant; when, wafted o'er,<BR>
The chief is landed on the Latian shore,<BR>
Whatever ships escape the raging storms,<BR>
At my command shall change their fading forms<BR>
To nymphs divine, and plow the wat'ry way,<BR>
Like Dotis and the daughters of the sea."<BR>
To seal his sacred vow, by Styx he swore,<BR>
The lake of liquid pitch, the dreary shore,<BR>
And Phlegethon's innavigable flood,<BR>
And the black regions of his brother god.<BR>
He said; and shook the skies with his imperial nod.</P>
<P>And now at length the number'd hours were come,<BR>
Prefix'd by fate's irrevocable doom,<BR>
When the great Mother of the Gods was free<BR>
To save her ships, and finish Jove's decree.<BR>
First, from the quarter of the morn, there sprung<BR>
A light that sign'd the heav'ns, and shot along;<BR>
Then from a cloud, fring'd round with golden fires,<BR>
Were timbrels heard, and Berecynthian choirs;<BR>
And, last, a voice, with more than mortal sounds,<BR>
Both hosts, in arms oppos'd, with equal horror wounds:<BR>
"O Trojan race, your needless aid forbear,<BR>
And know, my ships are my peculiar care.<BR>
With greater ease the bold Rutulian may,<BR>
With hissing brands, attempt to burn the sea,<BR>
Than singe my sacred pines. But you, my charge,<BR>
Loos'd from your crooked anchors, launch at large,<BR>
Exalted each a nymph: forsake the sand,<BR>
And swim the seas, at Cybele's command."<BR>
No sooner had the goddess ceas'd to speak,<BR>
When, lo! th' obedient ships their haulsers break;<BR>
And, strange to tell, like dolphins, in the main<BR>
They plunge their prows, and dive, and spring again:<BR>
As many beauteous maids the billows sweep,<BR>
As rode before tall vessels on the deep.</P>
<P>The foes, surpris'd with wonder, stood aghast;<BR>
Messapus curb'd his fiery courser's haste;<BR>
Old Tiber roar'd, and, raising up his head,<BR>
Call'd back his waters to their oozy bed.<BR>
Turnus alone, undaunted, bore the shock,<BR>
And with these words his trembling troops bespoke:<BR>
"These monsters for the Trojans' fate are meant,<BR>
And are by Jove for black presages sent.<BR>
He takes the cowards' last relief away;<BR>
For fly they cannot, and, constrain'd to stay,<BR>
Must yield unfought, a base inglorious prey.<BR>
The liquid half of all the globe is lost;<BR>
Heav'n shuts the seas, and we secure the coast.<BR>
Theirs is no more than that small spot of ground<BR>
Which myriads of our martial men surround.<BR>
Their fates I fear not, or vain oracles.<BR>
'T was giv'n to Venus they should cross the seas,<BR>
And land secure upon the Latian plains:<BR>
Their promis'd hour is pass'd, and mine remains.<BR>
'T is in the fate of Turnus to destroy,<BR>
With sword and fire, the faithless race of Troy.<BR>
Shall such affronts as these alone inflame<BR>
The Grecian brothers, and the Grecian name?<BR>
My cause and theirs is one; a fatal strife,<BR>
And final ruin, for a ravish'd wife.<BR>
Was 't not enough, that, punish'd for the crime,<BR>
They fell; but will they fall a second time?<BR>
One would have thought they paid enough before,<BR>
To curse the costly sex, and durst offend no more.<BR>
Can they securely trust their feeble wall,<BR>
A slight partition, a thin interval,<BR>
Betwixt their fate and them; when Troy, tho' built<BR>
By hands divine, yet perish'd by their guilt?<BR>
Lend me, for once, my friends, your valiant hands,<BR>
To force from out their lines these dastard bands.<BR>
Less than a thousand ships will end this war,<BR>
Nor Vulcan needs his fated arms prepare.<BR>
Let all the Tuscans, all th' Arcadians, join!<BR>
Nor these, nor those, shall frustrate my design.<BR>
Let them not fear the treasons of the night,<BR>
The robb'd Palladium, the pretended flight:<BR>
Our onset shall be made in open light.<BR>
No wooden engine shall their town betray;<BR>
Fires they shall have around, but fires by day.<BR>
No Grecian babes before their camp appear,<BR>
Whom Hector's arms detain'd to the tenth tardy year.<BR>
Now, since the sun is rolling to the west,<BR>
Give we the silent night to needful rest:<BR>
Refresh your bodies, and your arms prepare;<BR>
The morn shall end the small remains of war."</P>
<P>The post of honor to Messapus falls,<BR>
To keep the nightly guard, to watch the walls,<BR>
To pitch the fires at distances around,<BR>
And close the Trojans in their scanty ground.<BR>
Twice seven Rutulian captains ready stand,<BR>
And twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command;<BR>
All clad in shining arms the works invest,<BR>
Each with a radiant helm and waving crest.<BR>
Stretch'd at their length, they press the grassy ground;<BR>
They laugh, they sing, (the jolly bowls go round,)<BR>
With lights and cheerful fires renew the day,<BR>
And pass the wakeful night in feasts and play.</P>
<P>The Trojans, from above, their foes beheld,<BR>
And with arm'd legions all the rampires fill'd.<BR>
Seiz'd with affright, their gates they first explore;<BR>
Join works to works with bridges, tow'r to tow'r:<BR>
Thus all things needful for defense abound.<BR>
Mnestheus and brave Seresthus walk the round,<BR>
Commission'd by their absent prince to share<BR>
The common danger, and divide the care.<BR>
The soldiers draw their lots, and, as they fall,<BR>
By turns relieve each other on the wall.</P>
<P>Nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance,<BR>
To watch the gate was warlike Nisus' chance.<BR>
His father Hyrtacus of noble blood;<BR>
His mother was a huntress of the wood,<BR>
And sent him to the wars. Well could he bear<BR>
His lance in fight, and dart the flying spear,<BR>
But better skill'd unerring shafts to send.<BR>
Beside him stood Euryalus, his friend:<BR>
Euryalus, than whom the Trojan host<BR>
No fairer face, or sweeter air, could boast-<BR>
Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun.<BR>
One was their care, and their delight was one:<BR>
One common hazard in the war they shar'd,<BR>
And now were both by choice upon the guard.</P>
<P>Then Nisus thus: "Or do the gods inspire<BR>
This warmth, or make we gods of our desire?<BR>
A gen'rous ardor boils within my breast,<BR>
Eager of action, enemy to rest:<BR>
This urges me to fight, and fires my mind<BR>
To leave a memorable name behind.<BR>
Thou see'st the foe secure; how faintly shine<BR>
Their scatter'd fires! the most, in sleep supine<BR>
Along the ground, an easy conquest lie:<BR>
The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply;<BR>
All hush'd around. Now hear what I revolve-<BR>
A thought unripe- and scarcely yet resolve.<BR>
Our absent prince both camp and council mourn;<BR>
By message both would hasten his return:<BR>
If they confer what I demand on thee,<BR>
(For fame is recompense enough for me,)<BR>
Methinks, beneath yon hill, I have espied<BR>
A way that safely will my passage guide."</P>
<P>Euryalus stood list'ning while he spoke,<BR>
With love of praise and noble envy struck;<BR>
Then to his ardent friend expos'd his mind:<BR>
"All this, alone, and leaving me behind!<BR>
Am I unworthy, Nisus, to be join'd?<BR>
Thinkist thou I can my share of glory yield,<BR>
Or send thee unassisted to the field?<BR>
Not so my father taught my childhood arms;<BR>
Born in a siege, and bred among alarms!<BR>
Nor is my youth unworthy of my friend,<BR>
Nor of the heav'n-born hero I attend.<BR>
The thing call'd life, with ease I can disclaim,<BR>
And think it over-sold to purchase fame."</P>
<P>Then Nisus thus: "Alas! thy tender years<BR>
Would minister new matter to my fears.<BR>
So may the gods, who view this friendly strife,<BR>
Restore me to thy lov'd embrace with life,<BR>
Condemn'd to pay my vows, (as sure I trust,)<BR>
This thy request is cruel and unjust.<BR>
But if some chance- as many chances are,<BR>
And doubtful hazards, in the deeds of war-<BR>
If one should reach my head, there let it fall,<BR>
And spare thy life; I would not perish all.<BR>
Thy bloomy youth deserves a longer date:<BR>
Live thou to mourn thy love's unhappy fate;<BR>
To bear my mangled body from the foe,<BR>
Or buy it back, and fun'ral rites bestow.<BR>
Or, if hard fortune shall those dues deny,<BR>
Thou canst at least an empty tomb supply.<BR>
O let not me the widow's tears renew!<BR>
Nor let a mother's curse my name pursue:<BR>
Thy pious parent, who, for love of thee,<BR>
Forsook the coasts of friendly Sicily,<BR>
Her age committing to the seas and wind,<BR>
When ev'ry weary matron stay'd behind."<BR>
To this, Euryalus: "You plead in vain,<BR>
And but protract the cause you cannot gain.<BR>
No more delays, but haste!" With that, he wakes<BR>
The nodding watch; each to his office takes.<BR>
The guard reliev'd, the gen'rous couple went<BR>
To find the council at the royal tent.</P>
<P>All creatures else forgot their daily care,<BR>
And sleep, the common gift of nature, share;<BR>
Except the Trojan peers, who wakeful sate<BR>
In nightly council for th' indanger'd state.<BR>
They vote a message to their absent chief,<BR>
Shew their distress, and beg a swift relief.<BR>
Amid the camp a silent seat they chose,<BR>
Remote from clamor, and secure from foes.<BR>
On their left arms their ample shields they bear,<BR>
The right reclin'd upon the bending spear.<BR>
Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard,<BR>
And beg admission, eager to be heard:<BR>
Th' affair important, not to be deferr'd.<BR>
Ascanius bids 'em be conducted in,<BR>
Ord'ring the more experienc'd to begin.<BR>
Then Nisus thus: "Ye fathers, lend your ears;<BR>
Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years.<BR>
The foe, securely drench'd in sleep and wine,<BR>
Neglect their watch; the fires but thinly shine;<BR>
And where the smoke in cloudy vapors flies,<BR>
Cov'ring the plain, and curling to the skies,<BR>
Betwixt two paths, which at the gate divide,<BR>
Close by the sea, a passage we have spied,<BR>
Which will our way to great Aeneas guide.<BR>
Expect each hour to see him safe again,<BR>
Loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain.<BR>
Snatch we the lucky minute while we may;<BR>
Nor can we be mistaken in the way;<BR>
For, hunting in the vale, we both have seen<BR>
The rising turrets, and the stream between,<BR>
And know the winding course, with ev'ry ford."</P>
<P>He ceas'd; and old Alethes took the word:<BR>
"Our country gods, in whom our trust we place,<BR>
Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race,<BR>
While we behold such dauntless worth appear<BR>
In dawning youth, and souls so void of fear."<BR>
Then into tears of joy the father broke;<BR>
Each in his longing arms by turns he took;<BR>
Panted and paus'd; and thus again he spoke:<BR>
"Ye brave young men, what equal gifts can we,<BR>
In recompense of such desert, decree?<BR>
The greatest, sure, and best you can receive,<BR>
The gods and your own conscious worth will give.<BR>
The rest our grateful gen'ral will bestow,<BR>
And young Ascanius till his manhood owe."</P>
<P>"And I, whose welfare in my father lies,"<BR>
Ascanius adds, "by the great deities,<BR>
By my dear country, by my household gods,<BR>
By hoary Vesta's rites and dark abodes,<BR>
Adjure you both, (on you my fortune stands;<BR>
That and my faith I plight into your hands,)<BR>
Make me but happy in his safe return,<BR>
Whose wanted presence I can only mourn;<BR>
Your common gift shall two large goblets be<BR>
Of silver, wrought with curious imagery,<BR>
And high emboss'd, which, when old Priam reign'd,<BR>
My conqu'ring sire at sack'd Arisba gain'd;<BR>
And more, two tripods cast in antic mold,<BR>
With two great talents of the finest gold;<BR>
Beside a costly bowl, ingrav'd with art,<BR>
Which Dido gave, when first she gave her heart.<BR>
But, if in conquer'd Italy we reign,<BR>
When spoils by lot the victor shall obtain-<BR>
Thou saw'st the courser by proud Turnus press'd:<BR>
That, Nisus, and his arms, and nodding crest,<BR>
And shield, from chance exempt, shall be thy share:<BR>
Twelve lab'ring slaves, twelve handmaids young and fair<BR>
All clad in rich attire, and train'd with care;<BR>
And, last, a Latian field with fruitful plains,<BR>
And a large portion of the king's domains.<BR>
But thou, whose years are more to mine allied-<BR>
No fate my vow'd affection shall divide<BR>
From thee, heroic youth! Be wholly mine;<BR>
Take full possession; all my soul is thine.<BR>
One faith, one fame, one fate, shall both attend;<BR>
My life's companion, and my bosom friend:<BR>
My peace shall be committed to thy care,<BR>
And to thy conduct my concerns in war."</P>
<P>Then thus the young Euryalus replied:<BR>
"Whatever fortune, good or bad, betide,<BR>
The same shall be my age, as now my youth;<BR>
No time shall find me wanting to my truth.<BR>
This only from your goodness let me gain<BR>
(And, this ungranted, all rewards are vain)<BR>
Of Priam's royal race my mother came-<BR>
And sure the best that ever bore the name-<BR>
Whom neither Troy nor Sicily could hold<BR>
From me departing, but, o'erspent and old,<BR>
My fate she follow'd. Ignorant of this<BR>
(Whatever) danger, neither parting kiss,<BR>
Nor pious blessing taken, her I leave,<BR>
And in this only act of all my life deceive.<BR>
By this right hand and conscious Night I swear,<BR>
My soul so sad a farewell could not bear.<BR>
Be you her comfort; fill my vacant place<BR>
(Permit me to presume so great a grace)<BR>
Support her age, forsaken and distress'd.<BR>
That hope alone will fortify my breast<BR>
Against the worst of fortunes, and of fears."<BR>
He said. The mov'd assistants melt in tears.</P>
<P>Then thus Ascanius, wonderstruck to see<BR>
That image of his filial piety:<BR>
"So great beginnings, in so green an age,<BR>
Exact the faith which I again ingage.<BR>
Thy mother all the dues shall justly claim,<BR>
Creusa had, and only want the name.<BR>
Whate'er event thy bold attempt shall have,<BR>
'T is merit to have borne a son so brave.<BR>
Now by my head, a sacred oath, I swear,<BR>
(My father us'd it,) what, returning here<BR>
Crown'd with success, I for thyself prepare,<BR>
That, if thou fail, shall thy lov'd mother share."</P>
<P>He said, and weeping, while he spoke the word,<BR>
From his broad belt he drew a shining sword,<BR>
Magnificent with gold. Lycaon made,<BR>
And in an ivory scabbard sheath'd the blade.<BR>
This was his gift. Great Mnestheus gave his friend<BR>
A lion's hide, his body to defend;<BR>
And good Alethes furnish'd him, beside,<BR>
With his own trusty helm, of temper tried.</P>
<P>Thus arm'd they went. The noble Trojans wait<BR>
Their issuing forth, and follow to the gate<BR>
With prayers and vows. Above the rest appears<BR>
Ascanius, manly far beyond his years,<BR>
And messages committed to their care,<BR>
Which all in winds were lost, and flitting air.</P>
<P>The trenches first they pass'd; then took their way<BR>
Where their proud foes in pitch'd pavilions lay;<BR>
To many fatal, ere themselves were slain.<BR>
They found the careless host dispers'd upon the plain,<BR>
Who, gorg'd, and drunk with wine, supinely snore.<BR>
Unharness'd chariots stand along the shore:<BR>
Amidst the wheels and reins, the goblet by,<BR>
A medley of debauch and war, they lie.<BR>
Observing Nisus shew'd his friend the sight:<BR>
"Behold a conquest gain'd without a fight.<BR>
Occasion offers, and I stand prepar'd;<BR>
There lies our way; be thou upon the guard,<BR>
And look around, while I securely go,<BR>
And hew a passage thro' the sleeping foe."<BR>
Softly he spoke; then striding took his way,<BR>
With his drawn sword, where haughty Rhamnes lay;<BR>
His head rais'd high on tapestry beneath,<BR>
And heaving from his breast, he drew his breath;<BR>
A king and prophet, by King Turnus lov'd:<BR>
But fate by prescience cannot be remov'd.<BR>
Him and his sleeping slaves he slew; then spies<BR>
Where Remus, with his rich retinue, lies.<BR>
His armor-bearer first, and next he kills<BR>
His charioteer, intrench'd betwixt the wheels<BR>
And his lov'd horses; last invades their lord;<BR>
Full on his neck he drives the fatal sword:<BR>
The gasping head flies off; a purple flood<BR>
Flows from the trunk, that welters in the blood,<BR>
Which, by the spurning heels dispers'd around,<BR>
The bed besprinkles and bedews the ground.<BR>
Lamus the bold, and Lamyrus the strong,<BR>
He slew, and then Serranus fair and young.<BR>
From dice and wine the youth retir'd to rest,<BR>
And puff'd the fumy god from out his breast:<BR>
Ev'n then he dreamt of drink and lucky play-<BR>
More lucky, had it lasted till the day.<BR>
The famish'd lion thus, with hunger bold,<BR>
O'erleaps the fences of the nightly fold,<BR>
And tears the peaceful flocks: with silent awe<BR>
Trembling they lie, and pant beneath his paw.</P>
<P>Nor with less rage Euryalus employs<BR>
The wrathful sword, or fewer foes destroys;<BR>
But on th' ignoble crowd his fury flew;<BR>
He Fadus, Hebesus, and Rhoetus slew.<BR>
Oppress'd with heavy sleep the former fell,<BR>
But Rhoetus wakeful, and observing all:<BR>
Behind a spacious jar he slink'd for fear;<BR>
The fatal iron found and reach'd him there;<BR>
For, as he rose, it pierc'd his naked side,<BR>
And, reeking, thence return'd in crimson dyed.<BR>
The wound pours out a stream of wine and blood;<BR>
The purple soul comes floating in the flood.</P>
<P>Now, where Messapus quarter'd, they arrive.<BR>
The fires were fainting there, and just alive;<BR>
The warrior-horses, tied in order, fed.<BR>
Nisus observ'd the discipline, and said:<BR>
"Our eager thirst of blood may both betray;<BR>
And see the scatter'd streaks of dawning day,<BR>
Foe to nocturnal thefts. No more, my friend;<BR>
Here let our glutted execution end.<BR>
A lane thro' slaughter'd bodies we have made."<BR>
The bold Euryalus, tho' loth, obey'd.<BR>
Of arms, and arras, and of plate, they find<BR>
A precious load; but these they leave behind.<BR>
Yet, fond of gaudy spoils, the boy would stay<BR>
To make the rich caparison his prey,<BR>
Which on the steed of conquer'd Rhamnes lay.<BR>
Nor did his eyes less longingly behold<BR>
The girdle-belt, with nails of burnish'd gold.<BR>
This present Caedicus the rich bestow'd<BR>
On Remulus, when friendship first they vow'd,<BR>
And, absent, join'd in hospitable ties:<BR>
He, dying, to his heir bequeath'd the prize;<BR>
Till, by the conqu'ring Ardean troops oppress'd,<BR>
He fell; and they the glorious gift possess'd.<BR>
These glitt'ring spoils (now made the victor's gain)<BR>
He to his body suits, but suits in vain:<BR>
Messapus' helm he finds among the rest,<BR>
And laces on, and wears the waving crest.<BR>
Proud of their conquest, prouder of their prey,<BR>
They leave the camp, and take the ready way.</P>
<P>But far they had not pass'd, before they spied<BR>
Three hundred horse, with Volscens for their guide.<BR>
The queen a legion to King Turnus sent;<BR>
But the swift horse the slower foot prevent,<BR>
And now, advancing, sought the leader's tent.<BR>
They saw the pair; for, thro' the doubtful shade,<BR>
His shining helm Euryalus betray'd,<BR>
On which the moon with full reflection play'd.<BR>
"'T is not for naught," cried Volscens from the crowd,<BR>
"These men go there;" then rais'd his voice aloud:<BR>
"Stand! stand! why thus in arms? And whither bent?<BR>
From whence, to whom, and on what errand sent?"<BR>
Silent they scud away, and haste their flight<BR>
To neighb'ring woods, and trust themselves to night.<BR>
The speedy horse all passages belay,<BR>
And spur their smoking steeds to cross their way,<BR>
And watch each entrance of the winding wood.<BR>
Black was the forest: thick with beech it stood,<BR>
Horrid with fern, and intricate with thorn;<BR>
Few paths of human feet, or tracks of beasts, were worn.<BR>
The darkness of the shades, his heavy prey,<BR>
And fear, misled the younger from his way.<BR>
But Nisus hit the turns with happier haste,<BR>
And, thoughtless of his friend, the forest pass'd,<BR>
And Alban plains, from Alba's name so call'd,<BR>
Where King Latinus then his oxen stall'd;<BR>
Till, turning at the length, he stood his ground,<BR>
And miss'd his friend, and cast his eyes around:<BR>
"Ah wretch!" he cried, "where have I left behind<BR>
Th' unhappy youth? where shall I hope to find?<BR>
Or what way take?" Again he ventures back,<BR>
And treads the mazes of his former track.<BR>
He winds the wood, and, list'ning, hears the noise<BR>
Of tramping coursers, and the riders' voice.<BR>
The sound approach'd; and suddenly he view'd<BR>
The foes inclosing, and his friend pursued,<BR>
Forelaid and taken, while he strove in vain<BR>
The shelter of the friendly shades to gain.<BR>
What should he next attempt? what arms employ,<BR>
What fruitless force, to free the captive boy?<BR>
Or desperate should he rush and lose his life,<BR>
With odds oppress'd, in such unequal strife?</P>
<P>Resolv'd at length, his pointed spear he shook;<BR>
And, casting on the moon a mournful look:<BR>
"Guardian of groves, and goddess of the night,<BR>
Fair queen," he said, "direct my dart aright.<BR>
If e'er my pious father, for my sake,<BR>
Did grateful off'rings on thy altars make,<BR>
Or I increas'd them with my sylvan toils,<BR>
And hung thy holy roofs with savage spoils,<BR>
Give me to scatter these." Then from his ear<BR>
He pois'd, and aim'd, and launch'd the trembling spear.<BR>
The deadly weapon, hissing from the grove,<BR>
Impetuous on the back of Sulmo drove;<BR>
Pierc'd his thin armor, drank his vital blood,<BR>
And in his body left the broken<BR>
He staggers round; his eyeballs roll in death,<BR>
And with short sobs he gasps away his breath.<BR>
All stand amaz'd- a second jav'lin flies<BR>
With equal strength, and quivers thro' the skies.<BR>
This thro' thy temples, Tagus, forc'd the way,<BR>
And in the brainpan warmly buried lay.<BR>
Fierce Volscens foams with rage, and, gazing round,<BR>
Descried not him who gave the fatal wound,<BR>
Nor knew to fix revenge: "But thou," he cries,<BR>
"Shalt pay for both," and at the pris'ner flies<BR>
With his drawn sword. Then, struck with deep despair,<BR>
That cruel sight the lover could not bear;<BR>
But from his covert rush'd in open view,<BR>
And sent his voice before him as he flew:<BR>
"Me! me!" he cried- "turn all your swords alone<BR>
On me- the fact confess'd, the fault my own.<BR>
He neither could nor durst, the guiltless youth:<BR>
Ye moon and stars, bear witness to the truth!<BR>
His only crime (if friendship can offend)<BR>
Is too much love to his unhappy friend."<BR>
Too late he speaks: the sword, which fury guides,<BR>
Driv'n with full force, had pierc'd his tender sides.<BR>
Down fell the beauteous youth: the yawning wound<BR>
Gush'd out a purple stream, and stain'd the ground.<BR>
His snowy neck reclines upon his breast,<BR>
Like a fair flow'r by the keen share oppress'd;<BR>
Like a white poppy sinking on the plain,<BR>
Whose heavy head is overcharg'd with rain.<BR>
Despair, and rage, and vengeance justly vow'd,<BR>
Drove Nisus headlong on the hostile crowd.<BR>
Volscens he seeks; on him alone he bends:<BR>
Borne back and bor'd by his surrounding friends,<BR>
Onward he press'd, and kept him still in sight;<BR>
Then whirl'd aloft his sword with all his might:<BR>
Th' unerring steel descended while he spoke,<BR>
Piered his wide mouth, and thro' his weazon broke.<BR>
Dying, he slew; and, stagg'ring on the plain,<BR>
With swimming eyes he sought his lover slain;<BR>
Then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell,<BR>
Content, in death, to be reveng'd so well.</P>
<P>O happy friends! for, if my verse can give<BR>
Immortal life, your fame shall ever live,<BR>
Fix'd as the Capitol's foundation lies,<BR>
And spread, where'er the Roman eagle flies!</P>
<P>The conqu'ring party first divide the prey,<BR>
Then their slain leader to the camp convey.<BR>
With wonder, as they went, the troops were fill'd,<BR>
To see such numbers whom so few had kill'd.<BR>
Serranus, Rhamnes, and the rest, they found:<BR>
Vast crowds the dying and the dead surround;<BR>
And the yet reeking blood o'erflows the ground.<BR>
All knew the helmet which Messapus lost,<BR>
But mourn'd a purchase that so dear had cost.<BR>
Now rose the ruddy morn from Tithon's bed,<BR>
And with the dawn of day the skies o'erspread;<BR>
Nor long the sun his daily course withheld,<BR>
But added colors to the world reveal'd:<BR>
When early Turnus, wak'ning with the light,<BR>
All clad in armor, calls his troops to fight.<BR>
His martial men with fierce harangue he fir'd,<BR>
And his own ardor in their souls inspir'd.<BR>
This done- to give new terror to his foes,<BR>
The heads of Nisus and his friend he shows,<BR>
Rais'd high on pointed spears- a ghastly sight:<BR>
Loud peals of shouts ensue, and barbarous delight.</P>
<P>Meantime the Trojans run, where danger calls;<BR>
They line their trenches, and they man their walls.<BR>
In front extended to the left they stood;<BR>
Safe was the right, surrounded by the flood.<BR>
But, casting from their tow'rs a frightful view,<BR>
They saw the faces, which too well they knew,<BR>
Tho' then disguis'd in death, and smear'd all o'er<BR>
With filth obscene, and dropping putrid gore.<BR>
Soon hasty fame thro' the sad city bears<BR>
The mournful message to the mother's ears.<BR>
An icy cold benumbs her limbs; she shakes;<BR>
Her cheeks the blood, her hand the web forsakes.<BR>
She runs the rampires round amidst the war,<BR>
Nor fears the flying darts; she rends her hair,<BR>
And fills with loud laments the liquid air.<BR>
"Thus, then, my lov'd Euryalus appears!<BR>
Thus looks the prop my declining years!<BR>
Was't on this face my famish'd eyes I fed?<BR>
Ah! how unlike the living is the dead!<BR>
And could'st thou leave me, cruel, thus alone?<BR>
Not one kind kiss from a departing son!<BR>
No look, no last adieu before he went,<BR>
In an ill-boding hour to slaughter sent!<BR>
Cold on the ground, and pressing foreign clay,<BR>
To Latian dogs and fowls he lies a prey!<BR>
Nor was I near to close his dying eyes,<BR>
To wash his wounds, to weep his obsequies,<BR>
To call about his corpse his crying friends,<BR>
Or spread the mantle (made for other ends)<BR>
On his dear body, which I wove with care,<BR>
Nor did my daily pains or nightly labor spare.<BR>
Where shall I find his corpse? what earth sustains<BR>
His trunk dismember'd, and his cold remains?<BR>
For this, alas! I left my needful ease,<BR>
Expos'd my life to winds and winter seas!<BR>
If any pity touch Rutulian hearts,<BR>
Here empty all your quivers, all your darts;<BR>
Or, if they fail, thou, Jove, conclude my woe,<BR>
And send me thunderstruck to shades below!"<BR>
Her shrieks and clamors pierce the Trojans' ears,<BR>
Unman their courage, and augment their fears;<BR>
Nor young Ascanius could the sight sustain,<BR>
Nor old Ilioneus his tears restrain,<BR>
But Actor and Idaeus jointly sent,<BR>
To bear the madding mother to her tent.</P>
<P>And now the trumpets terribly, from far,<BR>
With rattling clangor, rouse the sleepy war.<BR>
The soldiers' shouts succeed the brazen sounds;<BR>
And heav'n, from pole to pole, the noise rebounds.<BR>
The Volscians bear their shields upon their head,<BR>
And, rushing forward, form a moving shed.<BR>
These fill the ditch; those pull the bulwarks down:<BR>
Some raise the ladders; others scale the town.<BR>
But, where void spaces on the walls appear,<BR>
Or thin defense, they pour their forces there.<BR>
With poles and missive weapons, from afar,<BR>
The Trojans keep aloof the rising war.<BR>
Taught, by their ten years' siege, defensive fight,<BR>
They roll down ribs of rocks, an unresisted weight,<BR>
To break the penthouse with the pond'rous blow,<BR>
Which yet the patient Volscians undergo:<BR>
But could not bear th' unequal combat long;<BR>
For, where the Trojans find the thickest throng,<BR>
The ruin falls: their shatter'd shields give way,<BR>
And their crush'd heads become an easy prey.<BR>
They shrink for fear, abated of their rage,<BR>
Nor longer dare in a blind fight engage;<BR>
Contented now to gall them from below<BR>
With darts and slings, and with the distant bow.</P>
<P>Elsewhere Mezentius, terrible to view,<BR>
A blazing pine within the trenches threw.<BR>
But brave Messapus, Neptune's warlike son,<BR>
Broke down the palisades, the trenches won,<BR>
And loud for ladders calls, to scale the town.</P>
<P>Calliope, begin! Ye sacred Nine,<BR>
Inspire your poet in his high design,<BR>
To sing what slaughter manly Turnus made,<BR>
What souls he sent below the Stygian shade,<BR>
What fame the soldiers with their captain share,<BR>
And the vast circuit of the fatal war;<BR>
For you in singing martial facts excel;<BR>
You best remember, and alone can tell.</P>
<P>There stood a tow'r, amazing to the sight,<BR>
Built up of beams, and of stupendous height:<BR>
Art, and the nature of the place, conspir'd<BR>
To furnish all the strength that war requir'd.<BR>
To level this, the bold Italians join;<BR>
The wary Trojans obviate their design;<BR>
With weighty stones o'erwhelm their troops below,<BR>
Shoot thro' the loopholes, and sharp jav'lins throw.<BR>
Turnus, the chief, toss'd from his thund'ring hand<BR>
Against the wooden walls, a flaming brand:<BR>
It stuck, the fiery plague; the winds were high;<BR>
The planks were season'd, and the timber dry.<BR>
Contagion caught the posts; it spread along,<BR>
Scorch'd, and to distance drove the scatter'd throng.<BR>
The Trojans fled; the fire pursued amain,<BR>
Still gath'ring fast upon the trembling train;<BR>
Till, crowding to the corners of the wall,<BR>
Down the defense and the defenders fall.<BR>
The mighty flaw makes heav'n itself resound:<BR>
The dead and dying Trojans strew the ground.<BR>
The tow'r, that follow'd on the fallen crew,<BR>
Whelm'd o'er their heads, and buried whom it slew:<BR>
Some stuck upon the darts themselves had sent;<BR>
All the same equal ruin underwent.</P>
<P>Young Lycus and Helenor only scape;<BR>
Sav'd- how, they know not- from the steepy leap.<BR>
Helenor, elder of the two: by birth,<BR>
On one side royal, one a son of earth,<BR>
Whom to the Lydian king Licymnia bare,<BR>
And sent her boasted bastard to the war<BR>
(A privilege which none but freemen share).<BR>
Slight were his arms, a sword and silver shield:<BR>
No marks of honor charg'd its empty field.<BR>
Light as he fell, so light the youth arose,<BR>
And rising, found himself amidst his foes;<BR>
Nor flight was left, nor hopes to force his way.<BR>
Embolden'd by despair, he stood at bay;<BR>
And- like a stag, whom all the troop surrounds<BR>
Of eager huntsmen and invading hounds-<BR>
Resolv'd on death, he dissipates his fears,<BR>
And bounds aloft against the pointed spears:<BR>
So dares the youth, secure of death; and throws<BR>
His dying body on his thickest foes.<BR>
But Lycus, swifter of his feet by far,<BR>
Runs, doubles, winds and turns, amidst the war;<BR>
Springs to the walls, and leaves his foes behind,<BR>
And snatches at the beam he first can find;<BR>
Looks up, and leaps aloft at all the stretch,<BR>
In hopes the helping hand of some kind friend to reach.<BR>
But Turnus follow'd hard his hunted prey<BR>
(His spear had almost reach'd him in the way,<BR>
Short of his reins, and scarce a span behind)<BR>
"Fool!" said the chief, "tho' fleeter than the wind,<BR>
Couldst thou presume to scape, when I pursue?"<BR>
He said, and downward by the feet he drew<BR>
The trembling dastard; at the tug he falls;<BR>
Vast ruins come along, rent from the smoking walls.<BR>
Thus on some silver swan, or tim'rous hare,<BR>
Jove's bird comes sousing down from upper air;<BR>
Her crooked talons truss the fearful prey:<BR>
Then out of sight she soars, and wings her way.<BR>
So seizes the grim wolf the tender lamb,<BR>
In vain lamented by the bleating dam.</P>
<P>Then rushing onward with a barb'rous cry,<BR>
The troops of Turnus to the combat fly.<BR>
The ditch with fagots fill'd, the daring foe<BR>
Toss'd firebrands to the steepy turrets throw.</P>
<P>Ilioneus, as bold Lucetius came<BR>
To force the gate, and feed the kindling flame,<BR>
Roll'd down the fragment of a rock so right,<BR>
It crush'd him double underneath the weight.<BR>
Two more young Liger and Asylas slew:<BR>
To bend the bow young Liger better knew;<BR>
Asylas best the pointed jav'lin threw.<BR>
Brave Caeneus laid Ortygius on the plain;<BR>
The victor Caeneus was by Turnus slain.<BR>
By the same hand, Clonius and Itys fall,<BR>
Sagar, and Ida, standing on the wall.<BR>
From Capys' arms his fate Privernus found:<BR>
Hurt by Themilla first-but slight the wound-<BR>
His shield thrown by, to mitigate the smart,<BR>
He clapp'd his hand upon the wounded part:<BR>
The second shaft came swift and unespied,<BR>
And pierc'd his hand, and nail'd it to his side,<BR>
Transfix'd his breathing lungs and beating heart:<BR>
The soul came issuing out, and hiss'd against the dart.</P>
<P>The son of Arcens shone amid the rest,<BR>
In glitt'ring armor and a purple vest,<BR>
(Fair was his face, his eyes inspiring love,)<BR>
Bred by his father in the Martian grove,<BR>
Where the fat altars of Palicus flame,<BR>
And send in arms to purchase early fame.<BR>
Him when he spied from far, the Tuscan king<BR>
Laid by the lance, and took him to the sling,<BR>
Thrice whirl'd the thong around his head, and threw:<BR>
The heated lead half melted as it flew;<BR>
It pierc'd his hollow temples and his brain;<BR>
The youth came tumbling down, and spurn'd the plain.</P>
<P>Then young Ascanius, who, before this day,<BR>
Was wont in woods to shoot the savage prey,<BR>
First bent in martial strife the twanging bow,<BR>
And exercis'd against a human foe-<BR>
With this bereft Numanus of his life,<BR>
Who Turnus' younger sister took to wife.<BR>
Proud of his realm, and of his royal bride,<BR>
Vaunting before his troops, and lengthen'd with a stride,<BR>
In these insulting terms the Trojans he defied:</P>
<P>"Twice-conquer'd cowards, now your shame is shown-<BR>
Coop'd up a second time within your town!<BR>
Who dare not issue forth in open field,<BR>
But hold your walls before you for a shield.<BR>
Thus threat you war? thus our alliance force?<BR>
What gods, what madness, hether steer'd your course?<BR>
You shall not find the sons of Atreus here,<BR>
Nor need the frauds of sly Ulysses fear.<BR>
Strong from the cradle, of a sturdy brood,<BR>
We bear our newborn infants to the flood;<BR>
There bath'd amid the stream, our boys we hold,<BR>
With winter harden'd, and inur'd to cold.<BR>
They wake before the day to range the wood,<BR>
Kill ere they eat, nor taste unconquer'd food.<BR>
No sports, but what belong to war, they know:<BR>
To break the stubborn colt, to bend the bow.<BR>
Our youth, of labor patient, earn their bread;<BR>
Hardly they work, with frugal diet fed.<BR>
From plows and harrows sent to seek renown,<BR>
They fight in fields, and storm the shaken town.<BR>
No part of life from toils of war is free,<BR>
No change in age, or diff'rence in degree.<BR>
We plow and till in arms; our oxen feel,<BR>
Instead of goads, the spur and pointed steel;<BR>
Th' inverted lance makes furrows in the plain.<BR>
Ev'n time, that changes all, yet changes us in vain:<BR>
The body, not the mind; nor can control<BR>
Th' immortal vigor, or abate the soul.<BR>
Our helms defend the young, disguise the gray:<BR>
We live by plunder, and delight in prey.<BR>
Your vests embroider'd with rich purple shine;<BR>
In sloth you glory, and in dances join.<BR>
Your vests have sweeping sleeves; with female pride<BR>
Your turbants underneath your chins are tied.<BR>
Go, Phrygians, to your Dindymus again!<BR>
Go, less than women, in the shapes of men!<BR>
Go, mix'd with eunuchs, in the Mother's rites,<BR>
Where with unequal sound the flute invites;<BR>
Sing, dance, and howl, by turns, in Ida's shade:<BR>
Resign the war to men, who know the martial trade!"</P>
<P>This foul reproach Ascanius could not hear<BR>
With patience, or a vow'd revenge forbear.<BR>
At the full stretch of both his hands he drew,<BR>
And almost join'd the horns of the tough yew.<BR>
But, first, before the throne of Jove he stood,<BR>
And thus with lifted hands invok'd the god:<BR>
"My first attempt, great Jupiter, succeed!<BR>
An annual off'ring in thy grove shall bleed;<BR>
A snow-white steer, before thy altar led,<BR>
Who, like his mother, bears aloft his head,<BR>
Butts with his threat'ning brows, and bellowing stands,<BR>
And dares the fight, and spurns the yellow sands."</P>
<P>Jove bow'd the heav'ns, and lent a gracious ear,<BR>
And thunder'd on the left, amidst the clear.<BR>
Sounded at once the bow; and swiftly flies<BR>
The feather'd death, and hisses thro' the skies.<BR>
The steel thro' both his temples forc'd the way:<BR>
Extended on the ground, Numanus lay.<BR>
"Go now, vain boaster, and true valor scorn!<BR>
The Phrygians, twice subdued, yet make this third return."<BR>
Ascanius said no more. The Trojans shake<BR>
The heav'ns with shouting, and new vigor take.</P>
<P>Apollo then bestrode a golden cloud,<BR>
To view the feats of arms, and fighting crowd;<BR>
And thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud:<BR>
"Advance, illustrious youth, increase in fame,<BR>
And wide from east to west extend thy name;<BR>
Offspring of gods thyself; and Rome shall owe<BR>
To thee a race of demigods below.<BR>
This is the way to heav'n: the pow'rs divine<BR>
From this beginning date the Julian line.<BR>
To thee, to them, and their victorious heirs,<BR>
The conquer'd war is due, and the vast world is theirs.<BR>
Troy is too narrow for thy name." He said,<BR>
And plunging downward shot his radiant head;<BR>
Dispell'd the breathing air, that broke his flight:<BR>
Shorn of his beams, a man to mortal sight.<BR>
Old Butes' form he took, Anchises' squire,<BR>
Now left, to rule Ascanius, by his sire:<BR>
His wrinkled visage, and his hoary hairs,<BR>
His mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears,<BR>
And thus salutes the boy, too forward for his years:<BR>
"Suffice it thee, thy father's worthy son,<BR>
The warlike prize thou hast already won.<BR>
The god of archers gives thy youth a part<BR>
Of his own praise, nor envies equal art.<BR>
Now tempt the war no more." He said, and flew<BR>
Obscure in air, and vanish'd from their view.<BR>
The Trojans, by his arms, their patron know,<BR>
And hear the twanging of his heav'nly bow.<BR>
Then duteous force they use, and Phoebus' name,<BR>
To keep from fight the youth too fond of fame.<BR>
Undaunted, they themselves no danger shun;<BR>
From wall to wall the shouts and clamors run.<BR>
They bend their bows; they whirl their slings around;<BR>
Heaps of spent arrows fall, and strew the ground;<BR>
And helms, and shields, and rattling arms resound.<BR>
The combat thickens, like the storm that flies<BR>
From westward, when the show'ry Kids arise;<BR>
Or patt'ring hail comes pouring on the main,<BR>
When Jupiter descends in harden'd rain,<BR>
Or bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound,<BR>
And with an armed winter strew the ground.</P>
<P>Pand'rus and Bitias, thunderbolts of war,<BR>
Whom Hiera to bold Alcanor bare<BR>
On Ida's top, two youths of height and size<BR>
Like firs that on their mother mountain rise,<BR>
Presuming on their force, the gates unbar,<BR>
And of their own accord invite the war.<BR>
With fates averse, against their king's command,<BR>
Arm'd, on the right and on the left they stand,<BR>
And flank the passage: shining steel they wear,<BR>
And waving crests above their heads appear.<BR>
Thus two tall oaks, that Padus' banks adorn,<BR>
Lift up to heav'n their leafy heads unshorn,<BR>
And, overpress'd with nature's heavy load,<BR>
Dance to the whistling winds, and at each other nod.<BR>
In flows a tide of Latians, when they see<BR>
The gate set open, and the passage free;<BR>
Bold Quercens, with rash Tmarus, rushing on,<BR>
Equicolus, that in bright armor shone,<BR>
And Haemon first; but soon repuls'd they fly,<BR>
Or in the well-defended pass they die.<BR>
These with success are fir'd, and those with rage,<BR>
And each on equal terms at length ingage.<BR>
Drawn from their lines, and issuing on the plain,<BR>
The Trojans hand to hand the fight maintain.</P>
<P>Fierce Turnus in another quarter fought,<BR>
When suddenly th' unhop'd-for news was brought,<BR>
The foes had left the fastness of their place,<BR>
Prevail'd in fight, and had his men in chase.<BR>
He quits th' attack, and, to prevent their fate,<BR>
Runs where the giant brothers guard the gate.<BR>
The first he met, Antiphates the brave,<BR>
But base-begotten on a Theban slave,<BR>
Sarpedon's son, he slew: the deadly dart<BR>
Found passage thro' his breast, and pierc'd his heart.<BR>
Fix'd in the wound th' Italian cornel stood,<BR>
Warm'd in his lungs, and in his vital blood.<BR>
Aphidnus next, and Erymanthus dies,<BR>
And Meropes, and the gigantic size<BR>
Of Bitias, threat'ning with his ardent eyes.<BR>
Not by the feeble dart he fell oppress'd<BR>
(A dart were lost within that roomy breast),<BR>
But from a knotted lance, large, heavy, strong,<BR>
Which roar'd like thunder as it whirl'd along:<BR>
Not two bull hides th' impetuous force withhold,<BR>
Nor coat of double mail, with scales of gold.<BR>
Down sunk the monster bulk and press'd the ground;<BR>
His arms and clatt'ring shield on the vast body sound,<BR>
Not with less ruin than the Bajan mole,<BR>
Rais'd on the seas, the surges to control-<BR>
At once comes tumbling down the rocky wall;<BR>
Prone to the deep, the stones disjointed fall<BR>
Of the vast pile; the scatter'd ocean flies;<BR>
Black sands, discolor'd froth, and mingled mud arise:<BR>
The frighted billows roll, and seek the shores;<BR>
Then trembles Prochyta, then Ischia roars:<BR>
Typhoeus, thrown beneath, by Jove's command,<BR>
Astonish'd at the flaw that shakes the land,<BR>
Soon shifts his weary side, and, scarce awake,<BR>
With wonder feels the weight press lighter on his back.</P>
<P>The warrior god the Latian troops inspir'd,<BR>
New strung their sinews, and their courage fir'd,<BR>
But chills the Trojan hearts with cold affright:<BR>
Then black despair precipitates their flight.</P>
<P>When Pandarus beheld his brother kill'd,<BR>
The town with fear and wild confusion fill'd,<BR>
He turns the hinges of the heavy gate<BR>
With both his hands, and adds his shoulders to the weight<BR>
Some happier friends within the walls inclos'd;<BR>
The rest shut out, to certain death expos'd:<BR>
Fool as he was, and frantic in his care,<BR>
T' admit young Turnus, and include the war!<BR>
He thrust amid the crowd, securely bold,<BR>
Like a fierce tiger pent amid the fold.<BR>
Too late his blazing buckler they descry,<BR>
And sparkling fires that shot from either eye,<BR>
His mighty members, and his ample breast,<BR>
His rattling armor, and his crimson crest.</P>
<P>Far from that hated face the Trojans fly,<BR>
All but the fool who sought his destiny.<BR>
Mad Pandarus steps forth, with vengeance vow'd<BR>
For Bitias' death, and threatens thus aloud:<BR>
"These are not Ardea's walls, nor this the town<BR>
Amata proffers with Lavinia's crown:<BR>
'T is hostile earth you tread. Of hope bereft,<BR>
No means of safe return by flight are left."<BR>
To whom, with count'nance calm, and soul sedate,<BR>
Thus Turnus: "Then begin, and try thy fate:<BR>
My message to the ghost of Priam bear;<BR>
Tell him a new Achilles sent thee there."</P>
<P>A lance of tough ground ash the Trojan threw,<BR>
Rough in the rind, and knotted as it grew:<BR>
With his full force he whirl'd it first around;<BR>
But the soft yielding air receiv'd the wound:<BR>
Imperial Juno turn'd the course before,<BR>
And fix'd the wand'ring weapon in the door.</P>
<P>"But hope not thou," said Turnus, "when I strike,<BR>
To shun thy fate: our force is not alike,<BR>
Nor thy steel temper'd by the Lemnian god."<BR>
Then rising, on his utmost stretch he stood,<BR>
And aim'd from high: the full descending blow<BR>
Cleaves the broad front and beardless cheeks in two.<BR>
Down sinks the giant with a thund'ring sound:<BR>
His pond'rous limbs oppress the trembling ground;<BR>
Blood, brains, and foam gush from the gaping wound:<BR>
Scalp, face, and shoulders the keen steel divides,<BR>
And the shar'd visage hangs on equal sides.<BR>
The Trojans fly from their approaching fate;<BR>
And, had the victor then secur'd the gate,<BR>
And to his troops without unclos'd the bars,<BR>
One lucky day had ended all his wars.<BR>
But boiling youth, and blind desire of blood,<BR>
Push'd on his fury, to pursue the crowd.<BR>
Hamstring'd behind, unhappy Gyges died;<BR>
Then Phalaris is added to his side.<BR>
The pointed jav'lins from the dead he drew,<BR>
And their friends' arms against their fellows threw.<BR>
Strong Halys stands in vain; weak Phlegys flies;<BR>
Saturnia, still at hand, new force and fire supplies.<BR>
Then Halius, Prytanis, Alcander fall-<BR>
Ingag'd against the foes who scal'd the wall:<BR>
But, whom they fear'd without, they found within.<BR>
At last, tho' late, by Lynceus he was seen.<BR>
He calls new succors, and assaults the prince:<BR>
But weak his force, and vain is their defense.<BR>
Turn'd to the right, his sword the hero drew,<BR>
And at one blow the bold aggressor slew.<BR>
He joints the neck; and, with a stroke so strong,<BR>
The helm flies off, and bears the head along.<BR>
Next him, the huntsman Amycus he kill'd,<BR>
In darts invenom'd and in poison skill'd.<BR>
Then Clytius fell beneath his fatal spear,<BR>
And Creteus, whom the Muses held so dear:<BR>
He fought with courage, and he sung the fight;<BR>
Arms were his bus'ness, verses his delight.</P>
<P>The Trojan chiefs behold, with rage and grief,<BR>
Their slaughter'd friends, and hasten their relief.<BR>
Bold Mnestheus rallies first the broken train,<BR>
Whom brave Seresthus and his troop sustain.<BR>
To save the living, and revenge the dead,<BR>
Against one warrior's arms all Troy they led.<BR>
"O, void of sense and courage!" Mnestheus cried,<BR>
"Where can you hope your coward heads to hide?<BR>
Ah! where beyond these rampires can you run?<BR>
One man, and in your camp inclos'd, you shun!<BR>
Shall then a single sword such slaughter boast,<BR>
And pass unpunish'd from a num'rous host?<BR>
Forsaking honor, and renouncing fame,<BR>
Your gods, your country, and your king you shame!"<BR>
This just reproach their virtue does excite:<BR>
They stand, they join, they thicken to the fight.</P>
<P>Now Turnus doubts, and yet disdains to yield,<BR>
But with slow paces measures back the field,<BR>
And inches to the walls, where Tiber's tide,<BR>
Washing the camp, defends the weaker side.<BR>
The more he loses, they advance the more,<BR>
And tread in ev'ry step he trod before.<BR>
They shout: they bear him back; and, whom by might<BR>
They cannot conquer, they oppress with weight.</P>
<P>As, compass'd with a wood of spears around,<BR>
The lordly lion still maintains his ground;<BR>
Grins horrible, retires, and turns again;<BR>
Threats his distended paws, and shakes his mane;<BR>
He loses while in vain he presses on,<BR>
Nor will his courage let him dare to run:<BR>
So Turnus fares, and, unresolved of flight,<BR>
Moves tardy back, and just recedes from fight.<BR>
Yet twice, inrag'd, the combat he renews,<BR>
Twice breaks, and twice his broken foes pursues.<BR>
But now they swarm, and, with fresh troops supplied,<BR>
Come rolling on, and rush from ev'ry side:<BR>
Nor Juno, who sustain'd his arms before,<BR>
Dares with new strength suffice th' exhausted store;<BR>
For Jove, with sour commands, sent Iris down,<BR>
To force th' invader from the frighted town.</P>
<P>With labor spent, no longer can he wield<BR>
The heavy fanchion, or sustain the shield,<BR>
O'erwhelm'd with darts, which from afar they fling:<BR>
The weapons round his hollow temples ring;<BR>
His golden helm gives way, with stony blows<BR>
Batter'd, and flat, and beaten to his brows.<BR>
His crest is rash'd away; his ample shield<BR>
Is falsified, and round with jav'lins fill'd.</P>
<P>The foe, now faint, the Trojans overwhelm;<BR>
And Mnestheus lays hard load upon his helm.<BR>
Sick sweat succeeds; he drops at ev'ry pore;<BR>
With driving dust his cheeks are pasted o'er;<BR>
Shorter and shorter ev'ry gasp he takes;<BR>
And vain efforts and hurtless blows he makes.<BR>
Plung'd in the flood, and made the waters fly.<BR>
The yellow god the welcome burthen bore,<BR>
And wip'd the sweat, and wash'd away the gore;<BR>
Then gently wafts him to the farther coast,<BR>
And sends him safe to cheer his anxious host.</P>
