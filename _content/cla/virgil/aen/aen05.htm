<P>Meantime the Trojan cuts his wat'ry way,<BR>
Fix'd on his voyage, thro' the curling sea;<BR>
Then, casting back his eyes, with dire amaze,<BR>
Sees on the Punic shore the mounting blaze.<BR>
The cause unknown; yet his presaging mind<BR>
The fate of Dido from the fire divin'd;<BR>
He knew the stormy souls of womankind,<BR>
What secret springs their eager passions move,<BR>
How capable of death for injur'd love.<BR>
Dire auguries from hence the Trojans draw;<BR>
Till neither fires nor shining shores they saw.<BR>
Now seas and skies their prospect only bound;<BR>
An empty space above, a floating field around.<BR>
But soon the heav'ns with shadows were o'erspread;<BR>
A swelling cloud hung hov'ring o'er their head:<BR>
Livid it look'd, the threat'ning of a storm:<BR>
Then night and horror ocean's face deform.<BR>
The pilot, Palinurus, cried aloud:<BR>
"What gusts of weather from that gath'ring cloud<BR>
My thoughts presage! Ere yet the tempest roars,<BR>
Stand to your tackle, mates, and stretch your oars;<BR>
Contract your swelling sails, and luff to wind."<BR>
The frighted crew perform the task assign'd.<BR>
Then, to his fearless chief: "Not Heav'n," said he,<BR>
"Tho' Jove himself should promise Italy,<BR>
Can stem the torrent of this raging sea.<BR>
Mark how the shifting winds from west arise,<BR>
And what collected night involves the skies!<BR>
Nor can our shaken vessels live at sea,<BR>
Much less against the tempest force their way.<BR>
'T is fate diverts our course, and fate we must obey.<BR>
Not far from hence, if I observ'd aright<BR>
The southing of the stars, and polar light,<BR>
Sicilia lies, whose hospitable shores<BR>
In safety we may reach with struggling oars."<BR>
Aeneas then replied: "Too sure I find<BR>
We strive in vain against the seas and wind:<BR>
Now shift your sails; what place can please me more<BR>
Than what you promise, the Sicilian shore,<BR>
Whose hallow'd earth Anchises' bones contains,<BR>
And where a prince of Trojan lineage reigns?"<BR>
The course resolv'd, before the western wind<BR>
They scud amain, and make the port assign'd.<BR>
Meantime Acestes, from a lofty stand,<BR>
Beheld the fleet descending on the land;<BR>
And, not unmindful of his ancient race,<BR>
Down from the cliff he ran with eager pace,<BR>
And held the hero in a strict embrace.<BR>
Of a rough Libyan bear the spoils he wore,<BR>
And either hand a pointed jav'lin bore.<BR>
His mother was a dame of Dardan blood;<BR>
His sire Crinisus, a Sicilian flood.<BR>
He welcomes his returning friends ashore<BR>
With plenteous country cates and homely store.</P>
<P>Now, when the following morn had chas'd away<BR>
The flying stars, and light restor'd the day,<BR>
Aeneas call'd the Trojan troops around,<BR>
And thus bespoke them from a rising ground:<BR>
"Offspring of heav'n, divine Dardanian race!<BR>
The sun, revolving thro' th' ethereal space,<BR>
The shining circle of the year has fill'd,<BR>
Since first this isle my father's ashes held:<BR>
And now the rising day renews the year;<BR>
A day for ever sad, for ever dear.<BR>
This would I celebrate with annual games,<BR>
With gifts on altars pil'd, and holy flames,<BR>
Tho' banish'd to Gaetulia's barren sands,<BR>
Caught on the Grecian seas, or hostile lands:<BR>
But since this happy storm our fleet has driv'n<BR>
(Not, as I deem, without the will of Heav'n)<BR>
Upon these friendly shores and flow'ry plains,<BR>
Which hide Anchises and his blest remains,<BR>
Let us with joy perform his honors due,<BR>
And pray for prosp'rous winds, our voyage to renew;<BR>
Pray, that in towns and temples of our own,<BR>
The name of great Anchises may be known,<BR>
And yearly games may spread the gods' renown.<BR>
Our sports Acestes, of the Trojan race,<BR>
With royal gifts ordain'd, is pleas'd to grace:<BR>
Two steers on ev'ry ship the king bestows;<BR>
His gods and ours shall share your equal vows.<BR>
Besides, if, nine days hence, the rosy morn<BR>
Shall with unclouded light the skies adorn,<BR>
That day with solemn sports I mean to grace:<BR>
Light galleys on the seas shall run a wat'ry race;<BR>
Some shall in swiftness for the goal contend,<BR>
And others try the twanging bow to bend;<BR>
The strong, with iron gauntlets arm'd, shall stand<BR>
Oppos'd in combat on the yellow sand.<BR>
Let all be present at the games prepar'd,<BR>
And joyful victors wait the just reward.<BR>
But now assist the rites, with garlands crown'd."<BR>
He said, and first his brows with myrtle bound.<BR>
Then Helymus, by his example led,<BR>
And old Acestes, each adorn'd his head;<BR>
Thus young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace,<BR>
His temples tied, and all the Trojan race.<BR>
Aeneas then advanc'd amidst the train,<BR>
By thousands follow'd thro' the flow'ry plain,<BR>
To great Anchises' tomb; which when he found,<BR>
He pour'd to Bacchus, on the hallow'd ground,<BR>
Two bowls of sparkling wine, of milk two more,<BR>
And two (from offer'd bulls) of purple gore,<BR>
With roses then the sepulcher he strow'd<BR>
And thus his father's ghost bespoke aloud:<BR>
"Hail, O ye holy manes! hail again,<BR>
Paternal ashes, now review'd in vain!<BR>
The gods permitted not, that you, with me,<BR>
Should reach the promis'd shores of Italy,<BR>
Or Tiber's flood, what flood soe'er it be."<BR>
Scarce had he finish'd, when, with speckled pride,<BR>
A serpent from the tomb began to glide;<BR>
His hugy bulk on sev'n high volumes roll'd;<BR>
Blue was his breadth of back, but streak'd with scaly gold:<BR>
Thus riding on his curls, he seem'd to pass<BR>
A rolling fire along, and singe the grass.<BR>
More various colors thro' his body run,<BR>
Than Iris when her bow imbibes the sun.<BR>
Betwixt the rising altars, and around,<BR>
The sacred monster shot along the ground;<BR>
With harmless play amidst the bowls he pass'd,<BR>
And with his lolling tongue assay'd the taste:<BR>
Thus fed with holy food, the wondrous guest<BR>
Within the hollow tomb retir'd to rest.<BR>
The pious prince, surpris'd at what he view'd,<BR>
The fun'ral honors with more zeal renew'd,<BR>
Doubtful if this place's genius were,<BR>
Or guardian of his father's sepulcher.<BR>
Five sheep, according to the rites, he slew;<BR>
As many swine, and steers of sable hue;<BR>
New gen'rous wine he from the goblets pour'd.<BR>
And call'd his father's ghost, from hell restor'd.<BR>
The glad attendants in long order come,<BR>
Off'ring their gifts at great Anchises' tomb:<BR>
Some add more oxen: some divide the spoil;<BR>
Some place the chargers on the grassy soil;<BR>
Some blow the fires, and off entrails broil.</P>
<P>Now came the day desir'd. The skies were bright<BR>
With rosy luster of the rising light:<BR>
The bord'ring people, rous'd by sounding fame<BR>
Of Trojan feasts and great Acestes' name,<BR>
The crowded shore with acclamations fill,<BR>
Part to behold, and part to prove their skill.<BR>
And first the gifts in public view they place,<BR>
Green laurel wreaths, and palm, the victors' grace:<BR>
Within the circle, arms and tripods lie,<BR>
Ingots of gold and silver, heap'd on high,<BR>
And vests embroider'd, of the Tyrian dye.<BR>
The trumpet's clangor then the feast proclaims,<BR>
And all prepare for their appointed games.<BR>
Four galleys first, which equal rowers bear,<BR>
Advancing, in the wat'ry lists appear.<BR>
The speedy Dolphin, that outstrips the wind,<BR>
Bore Mnestheus, author of the Memmian kind:<BR>
Gyas the vast Chimaera's bulk commands,<BR>
Which rising, like a tow'ring city stands;<BR>
Three Trojans tug at ev'ry lab'ring oar;<BR>
Three banks in three degrees the sailors bore;<BR>
Beneath their sturdy strokes the billows roar.<BR>
Sergesthus, who began the Sergian race,<BR>
In the great Centaur took the leading place;<BR>
Cloanthus on the sea-green Scylla stood,<BR>
From whom Cluentius draws his Trojan blood.</P>
<P>Far in the sea, against the foaming shore,<BR>
There stands a rock: the raging billows roar<BR>
Above his head in storms; but, when 't is clear,<BR>
Uncurl their ridgy backs, and at his foot appear.<BR>
In peace below the gentle waters run;<BR>
The cormorants above lie basking in the sun.<BR>
On this the hero fix'd an oak in sight,<BR>
The mark to guide the mariners aright.<BR>
To bear with this, the seamen stretch their oars;<BR>
Then round the rock they steer, and seek the former shores.<BR>
The lots decide their place. Above the rest,<BR>
Each leader shining in his Tyrian vest;<BR>
The common crew with wreaths of poplar boughs<BR>
Their temples crown, and shade their sweaty brows:<BR>
Besmear'd with oil, their naked shoulders shine.<BR>
All take their seats, and wait the sounding sign:<BR>
They gripe their oars; and ev'ry panting breast<BR>
Is rais'd by turns with hope, by turns with fear depress'd.<BR>
The clangor of the trumpet gives the sign;<BR>
At once they start, advancing in a line:<BR>
With shouts the sailors rend the starry skies;<BR>
Lash'd with their oars, the smoky billows rise;<BR>
Sparkles the briny main, and the vex'd ocean fries.<BR>
Exact in time, with equal strokes they row:<BR>
At once the brushing oars and brazen prow<BR>
Dash up the sandy waves, and ope the depths below.<BR>
Not fiery coursers, in a chariot race,<BR>
Invade the field with half so swift a pace;<BR>
Not the fierce driver with more fury lends<BR>
The sounding lash, and, ere the stroke descends,<BR>
Low to the wheels his pliant body bends.<BR>
The partial crowd their hopes and fears divide,<BR>
And aid with eager shouts the favor'd side.<BR>
Cries, murmurs, clamors, with a mixing sound,<BR>
From woods to woods, from hills to hills rebound.</P>
<P>Amidst the loud applauses of the shore,<BR>
Gyas outstripp'd the rest, and sprung before:<BR>
Cloanthus, better mann'd, pursued him fast,<BR>
But his o'er-masted galley check'd his haste.<BR>
The Centaur and the Dolphin brush the brine<BR>
With equal oars, advancing in a line;<BR>
And now the mighty Centaur seems to lead,<BR>
And now the speedy Dolphin gets ahead;<BR>
Now board to board the rival vessels row,<BR>
The billows lave the skies, and ocean groans below.<BR>
They reach'd the mark. Proud Gyas and his train<BR>
In triumph rode, the victors of the main;<BR>
But, steering round, he charg'd his pilot stand<BR>
More close to shore, and skim along the sand-<BR>
"Let others bear to sea!" Menoetes heard;<BR>
But secret shelves too cautiously he fear'd,<BR>
And, fearing, sought the deep; and still aloof he steer'd.<BR>
With louder cries the captain call'd again:<BR>
"Bear to the rocky shore, and shun the main."<BR>
He spoke, and, speaking, at his stern he saw<BR>
The bold Cloanthus near the shelvings draw.<BR>
Betwixt the mark and him the Scylla stood,<BR>
And in a closer compass plow'd the flood.<BR>
He pass'd the mark; and, wheeling, got before:<BR>
Gyas blasphem'd the gods, devoutly swore,<BR>
Cried out for anger, and his hair he tore.<BR>
Mindless of others' lives (so high was grown<BR>
His rising rage) and careless of his own,<BR>
The trembling dotard to the deck he drew;<BR>
Then hoisted up, and overboard he threw:<BR>
This done, he seiz'd the helm; his fellows cheer'd,<BR>
Turn'd short upon the shelfs, and madly steer'd.</P>
<P>Hardly his head the plunging pilot rears,<BR>
Clogg'd with his clothes, and cumber'd with his years:<BR>
Now dropping wet, he climbs the cliff with pain.<BR>
The crowd, that saw him fall and float again,<BR>
Shout from the distant shore; and loudly laugh'd,<BR>
To see his heaving breast disgorge the briny draught.<BR>
The following Centaur, and the Dolphin's crew,<BR>
Their vanish'd hopes of victory renew;<BR>
While Gyas lags, they kindle in the race,<BR>
To reach the mark. Sergesthus takes the place;<BR>
Mnestheus pursues; and while around they wind,<BR>
Comes up, not half his galley's length behind;<BR>
Then, on the deck, amidst his mates appear'd,<BR>
And thus their drooping courage he cheer'd:<BR>
"My friends, and Hector's followers heretofore,<BR>
Exert your vigor; tug the lab'ring oar;<BR>
Stretch to your strokes, my still unconquer'd crew,<BR>
Whom from the flaming walls of Troy I drew.<BR>
In this, our common int'rest, let me find<BR>
That strength of hand, that courage of the mind,<BR>
As when you stemm'd the strong Malean flood,<BR>
And o'er the Syrtes' broken billows row'd.<BR>
I seek not now the foremost palm to gain;<BR>
Tho' yet- but, ah! that haughty wish is vain!<BR>
Let those enjoy it whom the gods ordain.<BR>
But to be last, the lags of all the race!-<BR>
Redeem yourselves and me from that disgrace."<BR>
Now, one and all, they tug amain; they row<BR>
At the full stretch, and shake the brazen prow.<BR>
The sea beneath 'em sinks; their lab'ring sides<BR>
Are swell'd, and sweat runs gutt'ring down in tides.<BR>
Chance aids their daring with unhop'd success;<BR>
Sergesthus, eager with his beak to press<BR>
Betwixt the rival galley and the rock,<BR>
Shuts up th' unwieldly Centaur in the lock.<BR>
The vessel struck; and, with the dreadful shock,<BR>
Her oars she shiver'd, and her head she broke.<BR>
The trembling rowers from their banks arise,<BR>
And, anxious for themselves, renounce the prize.<BR>
With iron poles they heave her off the shores,<BR>
And gather from the sea their floating oars.<BR>
The crew of Mnestheus, with elated minds,<BR>
Urge their success, and call the willing winds;<BR>
Then ply their oars, and cut their liquid way<BR>
In larger compass on the roomy sea.<BR>
As, when the dove her rocky hold forsakes,<BR>
Rous'd in a fright, her sounding wings she shakes;<BR>
The cavern rings with clatt'ring; out she flies,<BR>
And leaves her callow care, and cleaves the skies:<BR>
At first she flutters; but at length she springs<BR>
To smoother flight, and shoots upon her wings:<BR>
So Mnestheus in the Dolphin cuts the sea;<BR>
And, flying with a force, that force assists his way.<BR>
Sergesthus in the Centaur soon he pass'd,<BR>
Wedg'd in the rocky shoals, and sticking fast.<BR>
In vain the victor he with cries implores,<BR>
And practices to row with shatter'd oars.<BR>
Then Mnestheus bears with Gyas, and outflies:<BR>
The ship, without a pilot, yields the prize.<BR>
Unvanquish'd Scylla now alone remains;<BR>
Her he pursues, and all his vigor strains.<BR>
Shouts from the fav'ring multitude arise;<BR>
Applauding Echo to the shouts replies;<BR>
Shouts, wishes, and applause run rattling thro' the skies.<BR>
These clamors with disdain the Scylla heard,<BR>
Much grudg'd the praise, but more the robb'd reward:<BR>
Resolv'd to hold their own, they mend their pace,<BR>
All obstinate to die, or gain the race.<BR>
Rais'd with success, the Dolphin swiftly ran;<BR>
For they can conquer, who believe they can.<BR>
Both urge their oars, and fortune both supplies,<BR>
And both perhaps had shar'd an equal prize;<BR>
When to the seas Cloanthus holds his hands,<BR>
And succor from the wat'ry pow'rs demands:<BR>
"Gods of the liquid realms, on which I row!<BR>
If, giv'n by you, the laurel bind my brow,<BR>
Assist to make me guilty of my vow!<BR>
A snow-white bull shall on your shore be slain;<BR>
His offer'd entrails cast into the main,<BR>
And ruddy wine, from golden goblets thrown,<BR>
Your grateful gift and my return shall own."<BR>
The choir of nymphs, and Phorcus, from below,<BR>
With virgin Panopea, heard his vow;<BR>
And old Portunus, with his breadth of hand,<BR>
Push'd on, and sped the galley to the land.<BR>
Swift as a shaft, or winged wind, she flies,<BR>
And, darting to the port, obtains the prize.</P>
<P>The herald summons all, and then proclaims<BR>
Cloanthus conqu'ror of the naval games.<BR>
The prince with laurel crowns the victor's head,<BR>
And three fat steers are to his vessel led,<BR>
The ship's reward; with gen'rous wine beside,<BR>
And sums of silver, which the crew divide.<BR>
The leaders are distinguish'd from the rest;<BR>
The victor honor'd with a nobler vest,<BR>
Where gold and purple strive in equal rows,<BR>
And needlework its happy cost bestows.<BR>
There Ganymede is wrought with living art,<BR>
Chasing thro' Ida's groves the trembling hart:<BR>
Breathless he seems, yet eager to pursue;<BR>
When from aloft descends, in open view,<BR>
The bird of Jove, and, sousing on his prey,<BR>
With crooked talons bears the boy away.<BR>
In vain, with lifted hands and gazing eyes,<BR>
His guards behold him soaring thro' the skies,<BR>
And dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries.</P>
<P>Mnestheus the second victor was declar'd;<BR>
And, summon'd there, the second prize he shard.<BR>
A coat of mail, brave Demoleus bore,<BR>
More brave Aeneas from his shoulders tore,<BR>
In single combat on the Trojan shore:<BR>
This was ordain'd for Mnestheus to possess;<BR>
In war for his defense, for ornament in peace.<BR>
Rich was the gift, and glorious to behold,<BR>
But yet so pond'rous with its plates of gold,<BR>
That scarce two servants could the weight sustain;<BR>
Yet, loaded thus, Demoleus o'er the plain<BR>
Pursued and lightly seiz'd the Trojan train.<BR>
The third, succeeding to the last reward,<BR>
Two goodly bowls of massy silver shar'd,<BR>
With figures prominent, and richly wrought,<BR>
And two brass caldrons from Dodona brought.</P>
<P>Thus all, rewarded by the hero's hands,<BR>
Their conqu'ring temples bound with purple bands;<BR>
And now Sergesthus, clearing from the rock,<BR>
Brought back his galley shatter'd with the shock.<BR>
Forlorn she look'd, without an aiding oar,<BR>
And, houted by the vulgar, made to shore.<BR>
As when a snake, surpris'd upon the road,<BR>
Is crush'd athwart her body by the load<BR>
Of heavy wheels; or with a mortal wound<BR>
Her belly bruis'd, and trodden to the ground:<BR>
In vain, with loosen'd curls, she crawls along;<BR>
Yet, fierce above, she brandishes her tongue;<BR>
Glares with her eyes, and bristles with her scales;<BR>
But, groveling in the dust, her parts unsound she trails:<BR>
So slowly to the port the Centaur tends,<BR>
But, what she wants in oars, with sails amends.<BR>
Yet, for his galley sav'd, the grateful prince<BR>
Is pleas'd th' unhappy chief to recompense.<BR>
Pholoe, the Cretan slave, rewards his care,<BR>
Beauteous herself, with lovely twins as fair.</P>
<P>From thence his way the Trojan hero bent<BR>
Into the neighb'ring plain, with mountains pent,<BR>
Whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood.<BR>
Full in the midst of this fair valley stood<BR>
A native theater, which, rising slow<BR>
By just degrees, o'erlook'd the ground below.<BR>
High on a sylvan throne the leader sate;<BR>
A num'rous train attend in solemn state.<BR>
Here those that in the rapid course delight,<BR>
Desire of honor and the prize invite.<BR>
The rival runners without order stand;<BR>
The Trojans mix'd with the Sicilian band.<BR>
First Nisus, with Euryalus, appears;<BR>
Euryalus a boy of blooming years,<BR>
With sprightly grace and equal beauty crown'd;<BR>
Nisus, for friendship to the youth renown'd.<BR>
Diores next, of Priam's royal race,<BR>
Then Salius joined with Patron, took their place;<BR>
(But Patron in Arcadia had his birth,<BR>
And Salius his from Arcananian earth;)<BR>
Then two Sicilian youths- the names of these,<BR>
Swift Helymus, and lovely Panopes:<BR>
Both jolly huntsmen, both in forest bred,<BR>
And owning old Acestes for their head;<BR>
With sev'ral others of ignobler name,<BR>
Whom time has not deliver'd o'er to fame.</P>
<P>To these the hero thus his thoughts explain'd,<BR>
In words which gen'ral approbation gain'd:<BR>
"One common largess is for all design'd,<BR>
(The vanquish'd and the victor shall be join'd,)<BR>
Two darts of polish'd steel and Gnosian wood,<BR>
A silver-studded ax, alike bestow'd.<BR>
The foremost three have olive wreaths decreed:<BR>
The first of these obtains a stately steed,<BR>
Adorn'd with trappings; and the next in fame,<BR>
The quiver of an Amazonian dame,<BR>
With feather'd Thracian arrows well supplied:<BR>
A golden belt shall gird his manly side,<BR>
Which with a sparkling diamond shall be tied.<BR>
The third this Grecian helmet shall content."<BR>
He said. To their appointed base they went;<BR>
With beating hearts th' expected sign receive,<BR>
And, starting all at once, the barrier leave.<BR>
Spread out, as on the winged winds, they flew,<BR>
And seiz'd the distant goal with greedy view.<BR>
Shot from the crowd, swift Nisus all o'erpass'd;<BR>
Nor storms, nor thunder, equal half his haste.<BR>
The next, but tho' the next, yet far disjoin'd,<BR>
Came Salius, and Euryalus behind;<BR>
Then Helymus, whom young Diores plied,<BR>
Step after step, and almost side by side,<BR>
His shoulders pressing; and, in longer space,<BR>
Had won, or left at least a dubious race.</P>
<P>Now, spent, the goal they almost reach at last,<BR>
When eager Nisus, hapless in his haste,<BR>
Slipp'd first, and, slipping, fell upon the plain,<BR>
Soak'd with the blood of oxen newly slain.<BR>
The careless victor had not mark'd his way;<BR>
But, treading where the treach'rous puddle lay,<BR>
His heels flew up; and on the grassy floor<BR>
He fell, besmear'd with filth and holy gore.<BR>
Not mindless then, Euryalus, of thee,<BR>
Nor of the sacred bonds of amity,<BR>
He strove th' immediate rival's hope to cross,<BR>
And caught the foot of Salius as he rose.<BR>
So Salius lay extended on the plain;<BR>
Euryalus springs out, the prize to gain,<BR>
And leaves the crowd: applauding peals attend<BR>
The victor to the goal, who vanquish'd by his friend.<BR>
Next Helymus; and then Diores came,<BR>
By two misfortunes made the third in fame.</P>
<P>But Salius enters, and, exclaiming loud<BR>
For justice, deafens and disturbs the crowd;<BR>
Urges his cause may in the court be heard;<BR>
And pleads the prize is wrongfully conferr'd.<BR>
But favor for Euryalus appears;<BR>
His blooming beauty, with his tender tears,<BR>
Had brib'd the judges for the promis'd prize.<BR>
Besides, Diores fills the court with cries,<BR>
Who vainly reaches at the last reward,<BR>
If the first palm on Salius be conferr'd.<BR>
Then thus the prince: "Let no disputes arise:<BR>
Where fortune plac'd it, I award the prize.<BR>
But fortune's errors give me leave to mend,<BR>
At least to pity my deserving friend."<BR>
He said, and, from among the spoils, he draws<BR>
(Pond'rous with shaggy mane and golden paws)<BR>
A lion's hide: to Salius this he gives.<BR>
Nisus with envy sees the gift, and grieves.<BR>
"If such rewards to vanquish'd men are due."<BR>
He said, "and falling is to rise by you,<BR>
What prize may Nisus from your bounty claim,<BR>
Who merited the first rewards and fame?<BR>
In falling, both an equal fortune tried;<BR>
Would fortune for my fall so well provide!"<BR>
With this he pointed to his face, and show'd<BR>
His hand and all his habit smear'd with blood.<BR>
Th' indulgent father of the people smil'd,<BR>
And caus'd to be produc'd an ample shield,<BR>
Of wondrous art, by Didymaon wrought,<BR>
Long since from Neptune's bars in triumph brought.<BR>
This giv'n to Nisus, he divides the rest,<BR>
And equal justice in his gifts express'd.</P>
<P>The race thus ended, and rewards bestow'd,<BR>
Once more the princes bespeaks th' attentive crowd:<BR>
"If there he here whose dauntless courage dare<BR>
In gauntlet-fight, with limbs and body bare,<BR>
His opposite sustain in open view,<BR>
Stand forth the champion, and the games renew.<BR>
Two prizes I propose, and thus divide:<BR>
A bull with gilded horns, and fillets tied,<BR>
Shall be the portion of the conqu'ring chief;<BR>
A sword and helm shall cheer the loser's grief."</P>
<P>Then haughty Dares in the lists appears;<BR>
Stalking he strides, his head erected bears:<BR>
His nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield,<BR>
And loud applauses echo thro' the field.<BR>
Dares alone in combat us'd to stand<BR>
The match of mighty Paris, hand to hand;<BR>
The same, at Hector's fun'rals, undertook<BR>
Gigantic Butes, of th' Amycian stock,<BR>
And, by the stroke of his resistless hand,<BR>
Stretch'd the vast bulk upon the yellow sand.<BR>
Such Dares was; and such he strode along,<BR>
And drew the wonder of the gazing throng.<BR>
His brawny back and ample breast he shows,<BR>
His lifted arms around his head he throws,<BR>
And deals in whistling air his empty blows.<BR>
His match is sought; but, thro' the trembling band,<BR>
Not one dares answer to the proud demand.<BR>
Presuming of his force, with sparkling eyes<BR>
Already he devours the promis'd prize.<BR>
He claims the bull with awless insolence,<BR>
And having seiz'd his horns, accosts the prince:<BR>
"If none my matchless valor dares oppose,<BR>
How long shall Dares wait his dastard foes?<BR>
Permit me, chief, permit without delay,<BR>
To lead this uncontended gift away."<BR>
The crowd assents, and with redoubled cries<BR>
For the proud challenger demands the prize.</P>
<P>Acestes, fir'd with just disdain, to see<BR>
The palm usurp'd without a victory,<BR>
Reproach'd Entellus thus, who sate beside,<BR>
And heard and saw, unmov'd, the Trojan's pride:<BR>
"Once, but in vain, a champion of renown,<BR>
So tamely can you bear the ravish'd crown,<BR>
A prize in triumph borne before your sight,<BR>
And shun, for fear, the danger of the fight?<BR>
Where is our Eryx now, the boasted name,<BR>
The god who taught your thund'ring arm the game?<BR>
Where now your baffled honor? Where the spoil<BR>
That fill'd your house, and fame that fill'd our isle?"<BR>
Entellus, thus: "My soul is still the same,<BR>
Unmov'd with fear, and mov'd with martial fame;<BR>
But my chill blood is curdled in my veins,<BR>
And scarce the shadow of a man remains.<BR>
O could I turn to that fair prime again,<BR>
That prime of which this boaster is so vain,<BR>
The brave, who this decrepid age defies,<BR>
Should feel my force, without the promis'd prize."</P>
<P>He said; and, rising at the word, he threw<BR>
Two pond'rous gauntlets down in open view;<BR>
Gauntlets which Eryx wont in fight to wield,<BR>
And sheathe his hands with in the listed field.<BR>
With fear and wonder seiz'd, the crowd beholds<BR>
The gloves of death, with sev'n distinguish'd folds<BR>
Of tough bull hides; the space within is spread<BR>
With iron, or with loads of heavy lead:<BR>
Dares himself was daunted at the sight,<BR>
Renounc'd his challenge, and refus'd to fight.<BR>
Astonish'd at their weight, the hero stands,<BR>
And pois'd the pond'rous engines in his hands.<BR>
"What had your wonder," said Entellus, "been,<BR>
Had you the gauntlets of Alcides seen,<BR>
Or view'd the stern debate on this unhappy green!<BR>
These which I bear your brother Eryx bore,<BR>
Still mark'd with batter'd brains and mingled gore.<BR>
With these he long sustain'd th' Herculean arm;<BR>
And these I wielded while my blood was warm,<BR>
This languish'd frame while better spirits fed,<BR>
Ere age unstrung my nerves, or time o'ersnow'd my head.<BR>
But if the challenger these arms refuse,<BR>
And cannot wield their weight, or dare not use;<BR>
If great Aeneas and Acestes join<BR>
In his request, these gauntlets I resign;<BR>
Let us with equal arms perform the fight,<BR>
And let him leave to fear, since I resign my right."</P>
<P>This said, Entellus for the strife prepares;<BR>
Stripp'd of his quilted coat, his body bares;<BR>
Compos'd of mighty bones and brawn he stands,<BR>
A goodly tow'ring object on the sands.<BR>
Then just Aeneas equal arms supplied,<BR>
Which round their shoulders to their wrists they tied.<BR>
Both on the tiptoe stand, at full extent,<BR>
Their arms aloft, their bodies inly bent;<BR>
Their heads from aiming blows they bear afar;<BR>
With clashing gauntlets then provoke the war.<BR>
One on his youth and pliant limbs relies;<BR>
One on his sinews and his giant size.<BR>
The last is stiff with age, his motion slow;<BR>
He heaves for breath, he staggers to and fro,<BR>
And clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly blow.<BR>
Yet equal in success, they ward, they strike;<BR>
Their ways are diff'rent, but their art alike.<BR>
Before, behind, the blows are dealt; around<BR>
Their hollow sides the rattling thumps resound.<BR>
A storm of strokes, well meant, with fury flies,<BR>
And errs about their temples, ears, and eyes.<BR>
Nor always errs; for oft the gauntlet draws<BR>
A sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws.<BR>
Heavy with age, Entellus stands his ground,<BR>
But with his warping body wards the wound.<BR>
His hand and watchful eye keep even pace;<BR>
While Dares traverses and shifts his place,<BR>
And, like a captain who beleaguers round<BR>
Some strong-built castle on a rising ground,<BR>
Views all th' approaches with observing eyes:<BR>
This and that other part in vain he tries,<BR>
And more on industry than force relies.<BR>
With hands on high, Entellus threats the foe;<BR>
But Dares watch'd the motion from below,<BR>
And slipp'd aside, and shunn'd the long descending blow.<BR>
Entellus wastes his forces on the wind,<BR>
And, thus deluded of the stroke design'd,<BR>
Headlong and heavy fell; his ample breast<BR>
And weighty limbs his ancient mother press'd.<BR>
So falls a hollow pine, that long had stood<BR>
On Ida's height, or Erymanthus' wood,<BR>
Torn from the roots. The diff'ring nations rise,<BR>
And shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies,<BR>
Acestus runs with eager haste, to raise<BR>
The fall'n companion of his youthful days.<BR>
Dauntless he rose, and to the fight return'd;<BR>
With shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury burn'd.<BR>
Disdain and conscious virtue fir'd his breast,<BR>
And with redoubled force his foe he press'd.<BR>
He lays on load with either hand, amain,<BR>
And headlong drives the Trojan o'er the plain;<BR>
Nor stops, nor stays; nor rest nor breath allows;<BR>
But storms of strokes descend about his brows,<BR>
A rattling tempest, and a hail of blows.<BR>
But now the prince, who saw the wild increase<BR>
Of wounds, commands the combatants to cease,<BR>
And bounds Entellus' wrath, and bids the peace.<BR>
First to the Trojan, spent with toil, he came,<BR>
And sooth'd his sorrow for the suffer'd shame.<BR>
"What fury seiz'd my friend? The gods," said he,<BR>
"To him propitious, and averse to thee,<BR>
Have giv'n his arm superior force to thine.<BR>
'T is madness to contend with strength divine."<BR>
The gauntlet fight thus ended, from the shore<BR>
His faithful friends unhappy Dares bore:<BR>
His mouth and nostrils pour'd a purple flood,<BR>
And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood.<BR>
Faintly he stagger'd thro' the hissing throng,<BR>
And hung his head, and trail'd his legs along.<BR>
The sword and casque are carried by his train;<BR>
But with his foe the palm and ox remain.</P>
<P>The champion, then, before Aeneas came,<BR>
Proud of his prize, but prouder of his fame:<BR>
"O goddess-born, and you, Dardanian host,<BR>
Mark with attention, and forgive my boast;<BR>
Learn what I was, by what remains; and know<BR>
From what impending fate you sav'd my foe."<BR>
Sternly he spoke, and then confronts the bull;<BR>
And, on his ample forehead aiming full,<BR>
The deadly stroke, descending, pierc'd the skull.<BR>
Down drops the beast, nor needs a second wound,<BR>
But sprawls in pangs of death, and spurns the ground.<BR>
Then, thus: "In Dares' stead I offer this.<BR>
Eryx, accept a nobler sacrifice;<BR>
Take the last gift my wither'd arms can yield:<BR>
Thy gauntlets I resign, and here renounce the field."</P>
<P>This done, Aeneas orders, for the close,<BR>
The strife of archers with contending bows.<BR>
The mast Sergesthus' shatter'd galley bore<BR>
With his own hands he raises on the shore.<BR>
A flutt'ring dove upon the top they tie,<BR>
The living mark at which their arrows fly.<BR>
The rival archers in a line advance,<BR>
Their turn of shooting to receive from chance.<BR>
A helmet holds their names; the lots are drawn:<BR>
On the first scroll was read Hippocoon.<BR>
The people shout. Upon the next was found<BR>
Young Mnestheus, late with naval honors crown'd.<BR>
The third contain'd Eurytion's noble name,<BR>
Thy brother, Pandarus, and next in fame,<BR>
Whom Pallas urg'd the treaty to confound,<BR>
And send among the Greeks a feather'd wound.<BR>
Acestes in the bottom last remain'd,<BR>
Whom not his age from youthful sports restrain'd.<BR>
Soon all with vigor bend their trusty bows,<BR>
And from the quiver each his arrow chose.<BR>
Hippocoon's was the first: with forceful sway<BR>
It flew, and, whizzing, cut the liquid way.<BR>
Fix'd in the mast the feather'd weapon stands:<BR>
The fearful pigeon flutters in her bands,<BR>
And the tree trembled, and the shouting cries<BR>
Of the pleas'd people rend the vaulted skies.<BR>
Then Mnestheus to the head his arrow drove,<BR>
With lifted eyes, and took his aim above,<BR>
But made a glancing shot, and missed the dove;<BR>
Yet miss'd so narrow, that he cut the cord<BR>
Which fasten'd by the foot the flitting bird.<BR>
The captive thus releas'd, away she flies,<BR>
And beats with clapping wings the yielding skies.<BR>
His bow already bent, Eurytion stood;<BR>
And, having first invok'd his brother god,<BR>
His winged shaft with eager haste he sped.<BR>
The fatal message reach'd her as she fled:<BR>
She leaves her life aloft; she strikes the ground,<BR>
And renders back the weapon in the wound.<BR>
Acestes, grudging at his lot, remains,<BR>
Without a prize to gratify his pains.<BR>
Yet, shooting upward, sends his shaft, to show<BR>
An archer's art, and boast his twanging bow.<BR>
The feather'd arrow gave a dire portent,<BR>
And latter augurs judge from this event.<BR>
Chaf'd by the speed, it fir'd; and, as it flew,<BR>
A trail of following flames ascending drew:<BR>
Kindling they mount, and mark the shiny way;<BR>
Across the skies as falling meteors play,<BR>
And vanish into wind, or in a blaze decay.<BR>
The Trojans and Sicilians wildly stare,<BR>
And, trembling, turn their wonder into pray'r.<BR>
The Dardan prince put on a smiling face,<BR>
And strain'd Acestes with a close embrace;<BR>
Then, hon'ring him with gifts above the rest,<BR>
Turn'd the bad omen, nor his fears confess'd.<BR>
"The gods," said he, "this miracle have wrought,<BR>
And order'd you the prize without the lot.<BR>
Accept this goblet, rough with figur'd gold,<BR>
Which Thracian Cisseus gave my sire of old:<BR>
This pledge of ancient amity receive,<BR>
Which to my second sire I justly give."<BR>
He said, and, with the trumpets' cheerful sound,<BR>
Proclaim'd him victor, and with laurel-crown'd.<BR>
Nor good Eurytion envied him the prize,<BR>
Tho' he transfix'd the pigeon in the skies.<BR>
Who cut the line, with second gifts was grac'd;<BR>
The third was his whose arrow pierc'd the mast.</P>
<P>The chief, before the games were wholly done,<BR>
Call'd Periphantes, tutor to his son,<BR>
And whisper'd thus: "With speed Ascanius find;<BR>
And, if his childish troop be ready join'd,<BR>
On horseback let him grace his grandsire's day,<BR>
And lead his equals arm'd in just array."<BR>
He said; and, calling out, the cirque he clears.<BR>
The crowd withdrawn, an open plain appears.<BR>
And now the noble youths, of form divine,<BR>
Advance before their fathers, in a line;<BR>
The riders grace the steeds; the steeds with glory shine.</P>
<P>Thus marching on in military pride,<BR>
Shouts of applause resound from side to side.<BR>
Their casques adorn'd with laurel wreaths they wear,<BR>
Each brandishing aloft a cornel spear.<BR>
Some at their backs their gilded quivers bore;<BR>
Their chains of burnish'd gold hung down before.<BR>
Three graceful troops they form'd upon the green;<BR>
Three graceful leaders at their head were seen;<BR>
Twelve follow'd ev'ry chief, and left a space between.<BR>
The first young Priam led; a lovely boy,<BR>
Whose grandsire was th' unhappy king of Troy;<BR>
His race in after times was known to fame,<BR>
New honors adding to the Latian name;<BR>
And well the royal boy his Thracian steed became.<BR>
White were the fetlocks of his feet before,<BR>
And on his front a snowy star he bore.<BR>
Then beauteous Atys, with Iulus bred,<BR>
Of equal age, the second squadron led.<BR>
The last in order, but the first in place,<BR>
First in the lovely features of his face,<BR>
Rode fair Ascanius on a fiery steed,<BR>
Queen Dido's gift, and of the Tyrian breed.<BR>
Sure coursers for the rest the king ordains,<BR>
With golden bits adorn'd, and purple reins.</P>
<P>The pleas'd spectators peals of shouts renew,<BR>
And all the parents in the children view;<BR>
Their make, their motions, and their sprightly grace,<BR>
And hopes and fears alternate in their face.</P>
<P>Th' unfledg'd commanders and their martial train<BR>
First make the circuit of the sandy plain<BR>
Around their sires, and, at th' appointed sign,<BR>
Drawn up in beauteous order, form a line.<BR>
The second signal sounds, the troop divides<BR>
In three distinguish'd parts, with three distinguish'd guides<BR>
Again they close, and once again disjoin;<BR>
In troop to troop oppos'd, and line to line.<BR>
They meet; they wheel; they throw their darts afar<BR>
With harmless rage and well-dissembled war.<BR>
Then in a round the mingled bodies run:<BR>
Flying they follow, and pursuing shun;<BR>
Broken, they break; and, rallying, they renew<BR>
In other forms the military shew.<BR>
At last, in order, undiscern'd they join,<BR>
And march together in a friendly line.<BR>
And, as the Cretan labyrinth of old,<BR>
With wand'ring ways and many a winding fold,<BR>
Involv'd the weary feet, without redress,<BR>
In a round error, which denied recess;<BR>
So fought the Trojan boys in warlike play,<BR>
Turn'd and return'd, and still a diff'rent way.<BR>
Thus dolphins in the deep each other chase<BR>
In circles, when they swim around the wat'ry race.<BR>
This game, these carousels, Ascanius taught;<BR>
And, building Alba, to the Latins brought;<BR>
Shew'd what he learn'd: the Latin sires impart<BR>
To their succeeding sons the graceful art;<BR>
From these imperial Rome receiv'd the game,<BR>
Which Troy, the youths the Trojan troop, they name.</P>
<P>Thus far the sacred sports they celebrate:<BR>
But Fortune soon resum'd her ancient hate;<BR>
For, while they pay the dead his annual dues,<BR>
Those envied rites Saturnian Juno views;<BR>
And sends the goddess of the various bow,<BR>
To try new methods of revenge below;<BR>
Supplies the winds to wing her airy way,<BR>
Where in the port secure the navy lay.<BR>
Swiftly fair Iris down her arch descends,<BR>
And, undiscern'd, her fatal voyage ends.<BR>
She saw the gath'ring crowd; and, gliding thence,<BR>
The desart shore, and fleet without defense.<BR>
The Trojan matrons, on the sands alone,<BR>
With sighs and tears Anchises' death bemoan;<BR>
Then, turning to the sea their weeping eyes,<BR>
Their pity to themselves renews their cries.<BR>
"Alas!" said one, "what oceans yet remain<BR>
For us to sail! what labors to sustain!"<BR>
All take the word, and, with a gen'ral groan,<BR>
Implore the gods for peace, and places of their own.</P>
<P>The goddess, great in mischief, views their pains,<BR>
And in a woman's form her heav'nly limbs restrains.<BR>
In face and shape old Beroe she became,<BR>
Doryclus' wife, a venerable dame,<BR>
Once blest with riches, and a mother's name.<BR>
Thus chang'd, amidst the crying crowd she ran,<BR>
Mix'd with the matrons, and these words began:<BR>
"O wretched we, whom not the Grecian pow'r,<BR>
Nor flames, destroy'd, in Troy's unhappy hour!<BR>
O wretched we, reserv'd by cruel fate,<BR>
Beyond the ruins of the sinking state!<BR>
Now sev'n revolving years are wholly run,<BR>
Since this improsp'rous voyage we begun;<BR>
Since, toss'd from shores to shores, from lands to lands,<BR>
Inhospitable rocks and barren sands,<BR>
Wand'ring in exile thro' the stormy sea,<BR>
We search in vain for flying Italy.<BR>
Now cast by fortune on this kindred land,<BR>
What should our rest and rising walls withstand,<BR>
Or hinder here to fix our banish'd band?<BR>
O country lost, and gods redeem'd in vain,<BR>
If still in endless exile we remain!<BR>
Shall we no more the Trojan walls renew,<BR>
Or streams of some dissembled Simois view!<BR>
Haste, join with me, th' unhappy fleet consume!<BR>
Cassandra bids; and I declare her doom.<BR>
In sleep I saw her; she supplied my hands<BR>
(For this I more than dreamt) with flaming brands:<BR>
'With these,' said she, 'these wand'ring ships destroy:<BR>
These are your fatal seats, and this your Troy.'<BR>
Time calls you now; the precious hour employ:<BR>
Slack not the good presage, while Heav'n inspires<BR>
Our minds to dare, and gives the ready fires.<BR>
See! Neptune's altars minister their brands:<BR>
The god is pleas'd; the god supplies our hands."<BR>
Then from the pile a flaming fire she drew,<BR>
And, toss'd in air, amidst the galleys threw.</P>
<P>Wrapp'd in amaze, the matrons wildly stare:<BR>
Then Pyrgo, reverenc'd for her hoary hair,<BR>
Pyrgo, the nurse of Priam's num'rous race:<BR>
"No Beroe this, tho' she belies her face!<BR>
What terrors from her frowning front arise!<BR>
Behold a goddess in her ardent eyes!<BR>
What rays around her heav'nly face are seen!<BR>
Mark her majestic voice, and more than mortal mien!<BR>
Beroe but now I left, whom, pin'd with pain,<BR>
Her age and anguish from these rites detain,"<BR>
She said. The matrons, seiz'd with new amaze,<BR>
Roll their malignant eyes, and on the navy gaze.<BR>
They fear, and hope, and neither part obey:<BR>
They hope the fated land, but fear the fatal way.<BR>
The goddess, having done her task below,<BR>
Mounts up on equal wings, and bends her painted bow.<BR>
Struck with the sight, and seiz'd with rage divine,<BR>
The matrons prosecute their mad design:<BR>
They shriek aloud; they snatch, with impious hands,<BR>
The food of altars; fires and flaming brands.<BR>
Green boughs and saplings, mingled in their haste,<BR>
And smoking torches, on the ships they cast.<BR>
The flame, unstopp'd at first, more fury gains,<BR>
And Vulcan rides at large with loosen'd reins:<BR>
Triumphant to the painted sterns he soars,<BR>
And seizes, in this way, the banks and crackling oars.<BR>
Eumelus was the first the news to bear,<BR>
While yet they crowd the rural theater.<BR>
Then, what they hear, is witness'd by their eyes:<BR>
A storm of sparkles and of flames arise.<BR>
Ascanius took th' alarm, while yet he led<BR>
His early warriors on his prancing steed,<BR>
And, spurring on, his equals soon o'erpass'd;<BR>
Nor could his frighted friends reclaim his haste.<BR>
Soon as the royal youth appear'd in view,<BR>
He sent his voice before him as he flew:<BR>
"What madness moves you, matrons, to destroy<BR>
The last remainders of unhappy Troy!<BR>
Not hostile fleets, but your own hopes, you burn,<BR>
And on your friends your fatal fury turn.<BR>
Behold your own Ascanius!" While he said,<BR>
He drew his glitt'ring helmet from his head,<BR>
In which the youths to sportful arms he led.<BR>
By this, Aeneas and his train appear;<BR>
And now the women, seiz'd with shame and fear,<BR>
Dispers'd, to woods and caverns take their flight,<BR>
Abhor their actions, and avoid the light;<BR>
Their friends acknowledge, and their error find,<BR>
And shake the goddess from their alter'd mind.</P>
<P>Not so the raging fires their fury cease,<BR>
But, lurking in the seams, with seeming peace,<BR>
Work on their way amid the smold'ring tow,<BR>
Sure in destruction, but in motion slow.<BR>
The silent plague thro' the green timber eats,<BR>
And vomits out a tardy flame by fits.<BR>
Down to the keels, and upward to the sails,<BR>
The fire descends, or mounts, but still prevails;<BR>
Nor buckets pour'd, nor strength of human hand,<BR>
Can the victorious element withstand.</P>
<P>The pious hero rends his robe, and throws<BR>
To heav'n his hands, and with his hands his vows.<BR>
"O Jove," he cried, "if pray'rs can yet have place;<BR>
If thou abhorr'st not all the Dardan race;<BR>
If any spark of pity still remain;<BR>
If gods are gods, and not invok'd in vain;<BR>
Yet spare the relics of the Trojan train!<BR>
Yet from the flames our burning vessels free,<BR>
Or let thy fury fall alone on me!<BR>
At this devoted head thy thunder throw,<BR>
And send the willing sacrifice below!"</P>
<P>Scarce had he said, when southern storms arise:<BR>
From pole to pole the forky lightning flies;<BR>
Loud rattling shakes the mountains and the plain;<BR>
Heav'n bellies downward, and descends in rain.<BR>
Whole sheets of water from the clouds are sent,<BR>
Which, hissing thro' the planks, the flames prevent,<BR>
And stop the fiery pest. Four ships alone<BR>
Burn to the waist, and for the fleet atone.</P>
<P>But doubtful thoughts the hero's heart divide;<BR>
If he should still in Sicily reside,<BR>
Forgetful of his fates, or tempt the main,<BR>
In hope the promis'd Italy to gain.<BR>
Then Nautes, old and wise, to whom alone<BR>
The will of Heav'n by Pallas was foreshown;<BR>
Vers'd in portents, experienc'd, and inspir'd<BR>
To tell events, and what the fates requir'd;<BR>
Thus while he stood, to neither part inclin'd,<BR>
With cheerful words reliev'd his lab'ring mind:<BR>
"O goddess-born, resign'd in ev'ry state,<BR>
With patience bear, with prudence push your fate.<BR>
By suff'ring well, our Fortune we subdue;<BR>
Fly when she frowns, and, when she calls, pursue.<BR>
Your friend Acestes is of Trojan kind;<BR>
To him disclose the secrets of your mind:<BR>
Trust in his hands your old and useless train;<BR>
Too num'rous for the ships which yet remain:<BR>
The feeble, old, indulgent of their ease,<BR>
The dames who dread the dangers of the seas,<BR>
With all the dastard crew, who dare not stand<BR>
The shock of battle with your foes by land.<BR>
Here you may build a common town for all,<BR>
And, from Acestes' name, Acesta call."<BR>
The reasons, with his friend's experience join'd,<BR>
Encourag'd much, but more disturb'd his mind.</P>
<P>'T was dead of night; when to his slumb'ring eyes<BR>
His father's shade descended from the skies,<BR>
And thus he spoke: "O more than vital breath,<BR>
Lov'd while I liv'd, and dear ev'n after death;<BR>
O son, in various toils and troubles toss'd,<BR>
The King of Heav'n employs my careful ghost<BR>
On his commands: the god, who sav'd from fire<BR>
Your flaming fleet, and heard your just desire.<BR>
The wholesome counsel of your friend receive,<BR>
And here the coward train and woman leave:<BR>
The chosen youth, and those who nobly dare,<BR>
Transport, to tempt the dangers of the war.<BR>
The stern Italians will their courage try;<BR>
Rough are their manners, and their minds are high.<BR>
But first to Pluto's palace you shall go,<BR>
And seek my shade among the blest below:<BR>
For not with impious ghosts my soul remains,<BR>
Nor suffers with the damn'd perpetual pains,<BR>
But breathes the living air of soft Elysian plains.<BR>
The chaste Sibylla shall your steps convey,<BR>
And blood of offer'd victims free the way.<BR>
There shall you know what realms the gods assign,<BR>
And learn the fates and fortunes of your line.<BR>
But now, farewell! I vanish with the night,<BR>
And feel the blast of heav'n's approaching light."<BR>
He said, and mix'd with shades, and took his airy flight.<BR>
"Whither so fast?" the filial duty cried;<BR>
"And why, ah why, the wish'd embrace denied?"</P>
<P>He said, and rose; as holy zeal inspires,<BR>
He rakes hot embers, and renews the fires;<BR>
His country gods and Vesta then adores<BR>
With cakes and incense, and their aid implores.<BR>
Next, for his friends and royal host he sent,<BR>
Reveal'd his vision, and the gods' intent,<BR>
With his own purpose. All, without delay,<BR>
The will of Jove, and his desires obey.<BR>
They list with women each degenerate name,<BR>
Who dares not hazard life for future fame.<BR>
These they cashier: the brave remaining few,<BR>
Oars, banks, and cables, half consum'd, renew.<BR>
The prince designs a city with the plow;<BR>
The lots their sev'ral tenements allow.<BR>
This part is nam'd from Ilium, that from Troy,<BR>
And the new king ascends the throne with joy;<BR>
A chosen senate from the people draws;<BR>
Appoints the judges, and ordains the laws.<BR>
Then, on the top of Eryx, they begin<BR>
A rising temple to the Paphian queen.<BR>
Anchises, last, is honor'd as a god;<BR>
A priest is added, annual gifts bestow'd,<BR>
And groves are planted round his blest abode.<BR>
Nine days they pass in feasts, their temples crown'd;<BR>
And fumes of incense in the fanes abound.<BR>
Then from the south arose a gentle breeze<BR>
That curl'd the smoothness of the glassy seas;<BR>
The rising winds a ruffling gale afford,<BR>
And call the merry mariners aboard.</P>
<P>Now loud laments along the shores resound,<BR>
Of parting friends in close embraces bound.<BR>
The trembling women, the degenerate train,<BR>
Who shunn'd the frightful dangers of the main,<BR>
Ev'n those desire to sail, and take their share<BR>
Of the rough passage and the promis'd war:<BR>
Whom good Aeneas cheers, and recommends<BR>
To their new master's care his fearful friends.<BR>
On Eryx's altars three fat calves he lays;<BR>
A lamb new-fallen to the stormy seas;<BR>
Then slips his haulsers, and his anchors weighs.<BR>
High on the deck the godlike hero stands,<BR>
With olive crown'd, a charger in his hands;<BR>
Then cast the reeking entrails in the brine,<BR>
And pour'd the sacrifice of purple wine.<BR>
Fresh gales arise; with equal strokes they vie,<BR>
And brush the buxom seas, and o'er the billows fly.</P>
<P>Meantime the mother goddess, full of fears,<BR>
To Neptune thus address'd, with tender tears:<BR>
"The pride of Jove's imperious queen, the rage,<BR>
The malice which no suff'rings can assuage,<BR>
Compel me to these pray'rs; since neither fate,<BR>
Nor time, nor pity, can remove her hate:<BR>
Ev'n Jove is thwarted by his haughty wife;<BR>
Still vanquish'd, yet she still renews the strife.<BR>
As if 't were little to consume the town<BR>
Which aw'd the world, and wore th' imperial crown,<BR>
She prosecutes the ghost of Troy with pains,<BR>
And gnaws, ev'n to the bones, the last remains.<BR>
Let her the causes of her hatred tell;<BR>
But you can witness its effects too well.<BR>
You saw the storm she rais'd on Libyan floods,<BR>
That mix'd the mounting billows with the clouds;<BR>
When, bribing Aeolus, she shook the main,<BR>
And mov'd rebellion in your wat'ry reign.<BR>
With fury she possess'd the Dardan dames,<BR>
To burn their fleet with execrable flames,<BR>
And forc'd Aeneas, when his ships were lost,<BR>
To leave his foll'wers on a foreign coast.<BR>
For what remains, your godhead I implore,<BR>
And trust my son to your protecting pow'r.<BR>
If neither Jove's nor Fate's decree withstand,<BR>
Secure his passage to the Latian land."</P>
<P>Then thus the mighty Ruler of the Main:<BR>
"What may not Venus hope from Neptune's reign?<BR>
My kingdom claims your birth; my late defense<BR>
Of your indanger'd fleet may claim your confidence.<BR>
Nor less by land than sea my deeds declare<BR>
How much your lov'd Aeneas is my care.<BR>
Thee, Xanthus, and thee, Simois, I attest.<BR>
Your Trojan troops when proud Achilles press'd,<BR>
And drove before him headlong on the plain,<BR>
And dash'd against the walls the trembling train;<BR>
When floods were fill'd with bodies of the slain;<BR>
When crimson Xanthus, doubtful of his way,<BR>
Stood up on ridges to behold the sea;<BR>
(New heaps came tumbling in, and chok'd his way;)<BR>
When your Aeneas fought, but fought with odds<BR>
Of force unequal, and unequal gods;<BR>
I spread a cloud before the victor's sight,<BR>
Sustain'd the vanquish'd, and secur'd his flight;<BR>
Ev'n then secur'd him, when I sought with joy<BR>
The vow'd destruction of ungrateful Troy.<BR>
My will's the same: fair goddess, fear no more,<BR>
Your fleet shall safely gain the Latian shore;<BR>
Their lives are giv'n; one destin'd head alone<BR>
Shall perish, and for multitudes atone."<BR>
Thus having arm'd with hopes her anxious mind,<BR>
His finny team Saturnian Neptune join'd,<BR>
Then adds the foamy bridle to their jaws,<BR>
And to the loosen'd reins permits the laws.<BR>
High on the waves his azure car he guides;<BR>
Its axles thunder, and the sea subsides,<BR>
And the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides.<BR>
The tempests fly before their father's face,<BR>
Trains of inferior gods his triumph grace,<BR>
And monster whales before their master play,<BR>
And choirs of Tritons crowd the wat'ry way.<BR>
The marshal'd pow'rs in equal troops divide<BR>
To right and left; the gods his better side<BR>
Inclose, and on the worse the Nymphs and Nereids ride.</P>
<P>Now smiling hope, with sweet vicissitude,<BR>
Within the hero's mind his joys renew'd.<BR>
He calls to raise the masts, the sheets display;<BR>
The cheerful crew with diligence obey;<BR>
They scud before the wind, and sail in open sea.<BR>
Ahead of all the master pilot steers;<BR>
And, as he leads, the following navy veers.<BR>
The steeds of Night had travel'd half the sky,<BR>
The drowsy rowers on their benches lie,<BR>
When the soft God of Sleep, with easy flight,<BR>
Descends, and draws behind a trail of light.<BR>
Thou, Palinurus, art his destin'd prey;<BR>
To thee alone he takes his fatal way.<BR>
Dire dreams to thee, and iron sleep, he bears;<BR>
And, lighting on thy prow, the form of Phorbas wears.<BR>
Then thus the traitor god began his tale:<BR>
"The winds, my friend, inspire a pleasing gale;<BR>
The ships, without thy care, securely sail.<BR>
Now steal an hour of sweet repose; and I<BR>
Will take the rudder and thy room supply."<BR>
To whom the yawning pilot, half asleep:<BR>
"Me dost thou bid to trust the treach'rous deep,<BR>
The harlot smiles of her dissembling face,<BR>
And to her faith commit the Trojan race?<BR>
Shall I believe the Siren South again,<BR>
And, oft betray'd, not know the monster main?"<BR>
He said: his fasten'd hands the rudder keep,<BR>
And, fix'd on heav'n, his eyes repel invading sleep.<BR>
The god was wroth, and at his temples threw<BR>
A branch in Lethe dipp'd, and drunk with Stygian dew:<BR>
The pilot, vanquish'd by the pow'r divine,<BR>
Soon clos'd his swimming eyes, and lay supine.<BR>
Scarce were his limbs extended at their length,<BR>
The god, insulting with superior strength,<BR>
Fell heavy on him, plung'd him in the sea,<BR>
And, with the stern, the rudder tore away.<BR>
Headlong he fell, and, struggling in the main,<BR>
Cried out for helping hands, but cried in vain.<BR>
The victor daemon mounts obscure in air,<BR>
While the ship sails without the pilot's care.<BR>
On Neptune's faith the floating fleet relies;<BR>
But what the man forsook, the god supplies,<BR>
And o'er the dang'rous deep secure the navy flies;<BR>
Glides by the Sirens' cliffs, a shelfy coast,<BR>
Long infamous for ships and sailors lost,<BR>
And white with bones. Th' impetuous ocean roars,<BR>
And rocks rebellow from the sounding shores.<BR>
The watchful hero felt the knocks, and found<BR>
The tossing vessel sail'd on shoaly ground.<BR>
Sure of his pilot's loss, he takes himself<BR>
The helm, and steers aloof, and shuns the shelf.<BR>
Inly he griev'd, and, groaning from the breast,<BR>
Deplor'd his death; and thus his pain express'd:<BR>
"For faith repos'd on seas, and on the flatt'ring sky,<BR>
Thy naked corpse is doom'd on shores unknown to lie."</P>
