<P>All were attentive to the godlike man,<BR>
When from his lofty couch he thus began:<BR>
"Great queen, what you command me to relate<BR>
Renews the sad remembrance of our fate:<BR>
An empire from its old foundations rent,<BR>
And ev'ry woe the Trojans underwent;<BR>
A peopled city made a desart place;<BR>
All that I saw, and part of which I was:<BR>
Not ev'n the hardest of our foes could hear,<BR>
Nor stern Ulysses tell without a tear.<BR>
And now the latter watch of wasting night,<BR>
And setting stars, to kindly rest invite;<BR>
But, since you take such int'rest in our woe,<BR>
And Troy's disastrous end desire to know,<BR>
I will restrain my tears, and briefly tell<BR>
What in our last and fatal night befell.</P>
<P>"By destiny compell'd, and in despair,<BR>
The Greeks grew weary of the tedious war,<BR>
And by Minerva's aid a fabric rear'd,<BR>
Which like a steed of monstrous height appear'd:<BR>
The sides were plank'd with pine; they feign'd it made<BR>
For their return, and this the vow they paid.<BR>
Thus they pretend, but in the hollow side<BR>
Selected numbers of their soldiers hide:<BR>
With inward arms the dire machine they load,<BR>
And iron bowels stuff the dark abode.<BR>
In sight of Troy lies Tenedos, an isle<BR>
(While Fortune did on Priam's empire smile)<BR>
Renown'd for wealth; but, since, a faithless bay,<BR>
Where ships expos'd to wind and weather lay.<BR>
There was their fleet conceal'd. We thought, for Greece<BR>
Their sails were hoisted, and our fears release.<BR>
The Trojans, coop'd within their walls so long,<BR>
Unbar their gates, and issue in a throng,<BR>
Like swarming bees, and with delight survey<BR>
The camp deserted, where the Grecians lay:<BR>
The quarters of the sev'ral chiefs they show'd;<BR>
Here Phoenix, here Achilles, made abode;<BR>
Here join'd the battles; there the navy rode.<BR>
Part on the pile their wond'ring eyes employ:<BR>
The pile by Pallas rais'd to ruin Troy.<BR>
Thymoetes first ('t is doubtful whether hir'd,<BR>
Or so the Trojan destiny requir'd)<BR>
Mov'd that the ramparts might be broken down,<BR>
To lodge the monster fabric in the town.<BR>
But Capys, and the rest of sounder mind,<BR>
The fatal present to the flames designed,<BR>
Or to the wat'ry deep; at least to bore<BR>
The hollow sides, and hidden frauds explore.<BR>
The giddy vulgar, as their fancies guide,<BR>
With noise say nothing, and in parts divide.<BR>
Laocoon, follow'd by a num'rous crowd,<BR>
Ran from the fort, and cried, from far, aloud:<BR>
'O wretched countrymen! what fury reigns?<BR>
What more than madness has possess'd your brains?<BR>
Think you the Grecians from your coasts are gone?<BR>
And are Ulysses' arts no better known?<BR>
This hollow fabric either must inclose,<BR>
Within its blind recess, our secret foes;<BR>
Or 't is an engine rais'd above the town,<BR>
T' o'erlook the walls, and then to batter down.<BR>
Somewhat is sure design'd, by fraud or force:<BR>
Trust not their presents, nor admit the horse.'<BR>
Thus having said, against the steed he threw<BR>
His forceful spear, which, hissing as flew,<BR>
Pierc'd thro' the yielding planks of jointed wood,<BR>
And trembling in the hollow belly stood.<BR>
The sides, transpierc'd, return a rattling sound,<BR>
And groans of Greeks inclos'd come issuing thro' the wound<BR>
And, had not Heav'n the fall of Troy design'd,<BR>
Or had not men been fated to be blind,<BR>
Enough was said and done t'inspire a better mind.<BR>
Then had our lances pierc'd the treach'rous wood,<BR>
And Ilian tow'rs and Priam's empire stood.<BR>
Meantime, with shouts, the Trojan shepherds bring<BR>
A captive Greek, in bands, before the king;<BR>
Taken to take; who made himself their prey,<BR>
T' impose on their belief, and Troy betray;<BR>
Fix'd on his aim, and obstinately bent<BR>
To die undaunted, or to circumvent.<BR>
About the captive, tides of Trojans flow;<BR>
All press to see, and some insult the foe.<BR>
Now hear how well the Greeks their wiles disguis'd;<BR>
Behold a nation in a man compris'd.<BR>
Trembling the miscreant stood, unarm'd and bound;<BR>
He star'd, and roll'd his haggard eyes around,<BR>
Then said: 'Alas! what earth remains, what sea<BR>
Is open to receive unhappy me?<BR>
What fate a wretched fugitive attends,<BR>
Scorn'd by my foes, abandon'd by my friends?'<BR>
He said, and sigh'd, and cast a rueful eye:<BR>
Our pity kindles, and our passions die.<BR>
We cheer youth to make his own defense,<BR>
And freely tell us what he was, and whence:<BR>
What news he could impart, we long to know,<BR>
And what to credit from a captive foe.</P>
<P>"His fear at length dismiss'd, he said: 'Whate'er<BR>
My fate ordains, my words shall be sincere:<BR>
I neither can nor dare my birth disclaim;<BR>
Greece is my country, Sinon is my name.<BR>
Tho' plung'd by Fortune's pow'r in misery,<BR>
'T is not in Fortune's pow'r to make me lie.<BR>
If any chance has hither brought the name<BR>
Of Palamedes, not unknown to fame,<BR>
Who suffer'd from the malice of the times,<BR>
Accus'd and sentenc'd for pretended crimes,<BR>
Because these fatal wars he would prevent;<BR>
Whose death the wretched Greeks too late lament-<BR>
Me, then a boy, my father, poor and bare<BR>
Of other means, committed to his care,<BR>
His kinsman and companion in the war.<BR>
While Fortune favor'd, while his arms support<BR>
The cause, and rul'd the counsels, of the court,<BR>
I made some figure there; nor was my name<BR>
Obscure, nor I without my share of fame.<BR>
But when Ulysses, with fallacious arts,<BR>
Had made impression in the people's hearts,<BR>
And forg'd a treason in my patron's name<BR>
(I speak of things too far divulg'd by fame),<BR>
My kinsman fell. Then I, without support,<BR>
In private mourn'd his loss, and left the court.<BR>
Mad as I was, I could not bear his fate<BR>
With silent grief, but loudly blam'd the state,<BR>
And curs'd the direful author of my woes.<BR>
'T was told again; and hence my ruin rose.<BR>
I threaten'd, if indulgent Heav'n once more<BR>
Would land me safely on my native shore,<BR>
His death with double vengeance to restore.<BR>
This mov'd the murderer's hate; and soon ensued<BR>
Th' effects of malice from a man so proud.<BR>
Ambiguous rumors thro' the camp he spread,<BR>
And sought, by treason, my devoted head;<BR>
New crimes invented; left unturn'd no stone,<BR>
To make my guilt appear, and hide his own;<BR>
Till Calchas was by force and threat'ning wrought-<BR>
But why- why dwell I on that anxious thought?<BR>
If on my nation just revenge you seek,<BR>
And 't is t' appear a foe, t' appear a Greek;<BR>
Already you my name and country know;<BR>
Assuage your thirst of blood, and strike the blow:<BR>
My death will both the kingly brothers please,<BR>
And set insatiate Ithacus at ease.'<BR>
This fair unfinish'd tale, these broken starts,<BR>
Rais'd expectations in our longing hearts:<BR>
Unknowing as we were in Grecian arts.<BR>
His former trembling once again renew'd,<BR>
With acted fear, the villain thus pursued:</P>
<P>"'Long had the Grecians (tir'd with fruitless care,<BR>
And wearied with an unsuccessful war)<BR>
Resolv'd to raise the siege, and leave the town;<BR>
And, had the gods permitted, they had gone;<BR>
But oft the wintry seas and southern winds<BR>
Withstood their passage home, and chang'd their minds.<BR>
Portents and prodigies their souls amaz'd;<BR>
But most, when this stupendous pile was rais'd:<BR>
Then flaming meteors, hung in air, were seen,<BR>
And thunders rattled thro' a sky serene.<BR>
Dismay'd, and fearful of some dire event,<BR>
Eurypylus t' enquire their fate was sent.<BR>
He from the gods this dreadful answer brought:</P>
<P>"O Grecians, when the Trojan shores you sought,<BR>
Your passage with a virgin's blood was bought:<BR>
So must your safe return be bought again,<BR>
And Grecian blood once more atone the main."<BR>
The spreading rumor round the people ran;<BR>
All fear'd, and each believ'd himself the man.<BR>
Ulysses took th' advantage of their fright;<BR>
Call'd Calchas, and produc'd in open sight:<BR>
Then bade him name the wretch, ordain'd by fate<BR>
The public victim, to redeem the state.<BR>
Already some presag'd the dire event,<BR>
And saw what sacrifice Ulysses meant.<BR>
For twice five days the good old seer withstood<BR>
Th' intended treason, and was dumb to blood,<BR>
Till, tir'd, with endless clamors and pursuit<BR>
Of Ithacus, he stood no longer mute;<BR>
But, as it was agreed, pronounc'd that I<BR>
Was destin'd by the wrathful gods to die.<BR>
All prais'd the sentence, pleas'd the storm should fall<BR>
On one alone, whose fury threaten'd all.<BR>
The dismal day was come; the priests prepare<BR>
Their leaven'd cakes, and fillets for my hair.<BR>
I follow'd nature's laws, and must avow<BR>
I broke my bonds and fled the fatal blow.<BR>
Hid in a weedy lake all night I lay,<BR>
Secure of safety when they sail'd away.<BR>
But now what further hopes for me remain,<BR>
To see my friends, or native soil, again;<BR>
My tender infants, or my careful sire,<BR>
Whom they returning will to death require;<BR>
Will perpetrate on them their first design,<BR>
And take the forfeit of their heads for mine?<BR>
Which, O! if pity mortal minds can move,<BR>
If there be faith below, or gods above,<BR>
If innocence and truth can claim desert,<BR>
Ye Trojans, from an injur'd wretch avert.'</P>
<P>"False tears true pity move; the king commands<BR>
To loose his fetters, and unbind his hands:<BR>
Then adds these friendly words: 'Dismiss thy fears;<BR>
Forget the Greeks; be mine as thou wert theirs.<BR>
But truly tell, was it for force or guile,<BR>
Or some religious end, you rais'd the pile?'<BR>
Thus said the king. He, full of fraudful arts,<BR>
This well-invented tale for truth imparts:<BR>
'Ye lamps of heav'n!' he said, and lifted high<BR>
His hands now free, 'thou venerable sky!<BR>
Inviolable pow'rs, ador'd with dread!<BR>
Ye fatal fillets, that once bound this head!<BR>
Ye sacred altars, from whose flames I fled!<BR>
Be all of you adjur'd; and grant I may,<BR>
Without a crime, th' ungrateful Greeks betray,<BR>
Reveal the secrets of the guilty state,<BR>
And justly punish whom I justly hate!<BR>
But you, O king, preserve the faith you gave,<BR>
If I, to save myself, your empire save.<BR>
The Grecian hopes, and all th' attempts they made,<BR>
Were only founded on Minerva's aid.<BR>
But from the time when impious Diomede,<BR>
And false Ulysses, that inventive head,<BR>
Her fatal image from the temple drew,<BR>
The sleeping guardians of the castle slew,<BR>
Her virgin statue with their bloody hands<BR>
Polluted, and profan'd her holy bands;<BR>
From thence the tide of fortune left their shore,<BR>
And ebb'd much faster than it flow'd before:<BR>
Their courage languish'd, as their hopes decay'd;<BR>
And Pallas, now averse, refus'd her aid.<BR>
Nor did the goddess doubtfully declare<BR>
Her alter'd mind and alienated care.<BR>
When first her fatal image touch'd the ground,<BR>
She sternly cast her glaring eyes around,<BR>
That sparkled as they roll'd, and seem'd to threat:<BR>
Her heav'nly limbs distill'd a briny sweat.<BR>
Thrice from the ground she leap'd, was seen to wield<BR>
Her brandish'd lance, and shake her horrid shield.<BR>
Then Calchas bade our host for flight<BR>
And hope no conquest from the tedious war,<BR>
Till first they sail'd for Greece; with pray'rs besought<BR>
Her injur'd pow'r, and better omens brought.<BR>
And now their navy plows the wat'ry main,<BR>
Yet soon expect it on your shores again,<BR>
With Pallas pleas'd; as Calchas did ordain.<BR>
But first, to reconcile the blue-ey'd maid<BR>
For her stol'n statue and her tow'r betray'd,<BR>
Warn'd by the seer, to her offended name<BR>
We rais'd and dedicate this wondrous frame,<BR>
So lofty, lest thro' your forbidden gates<BR>
It pass, and intercept our better fates:<BR>
For, once admitted there, our hopes are lost;<BR>
And Troy may then a new Palladium boast;<BR>
For so religion and the gods ordain,<BR>
That, if you violate with hands profane<BR>
Minerva's gift, your town in flames shall burn,<BR>
(Which omen, O ye gods, on Graecia turn!)<BR>
But if it climb, with your assisting hands,<BR>
The Trojan walls, and in the city stands;<BR>
Then Troy shall Argos and Mycenae burn,<BR>
And the reverse of fate on us return.'</P>
<P>"With such deceits he gain'd their easy hearts,<BR>
Too prone to credit his perfidious arts.<BR>
What Diomede, nor Thetis' greater son,<BR>
A thousand ships, nor ten years' siege, had done-<BR>
False tears and fawning words the city won.</P>
<P>"A greater omen, and of worse portent,<BR>
Did our unwary minds with fear torment,<BR>
Concurring to produce the dire event.<BR>
Laocoon, Neptune's priest by lot that year,<BR>
With solemn pomp then sacrific'd a steer;<BR>
When, dreadful to behold, from sea we spied<BR>
Two serpents, rank'd abreast, the seas divide,<BR>
And smoothly sweep along the swelling tide.<BR>
Their flaming crests above the waves they show;<BR>
Their bellies seem to burn the seas below;<BR>
Their speckled tails advance to steer their course,<BR>
And on the sounding shore the flying billows force.<BR>
And now the strand, and now the plain they held;<BR>
Their ardent eyes with bloody streaks were fill'd;<BR>
Their nimble tongues they brandish'd as they came,<BR>
And lick'd their hissing jaws, that sputter'd flame.<BR>
We fled amaz'd; their destin'd way they take,<BR>
And to Laocoon and his children make;<BR>
And first around the tender boys they wind,<BR>
Then with their sharpen'd fangs their limbs and bodies grind.<BR>
The wretched father, running to their aid<BR>
With pious haste, but vain, they next invade;<BR>
Twice round his waist their winding volumes roll'd;<BR>
And twice about his gasping throat they fold.<BR>
The priest thus doubly chok'd, their crests divide,<BR>
And tow'ring o'er his head in triumph ride.<BR>
With both his hands he labors at the knots;<BR>
His holy fillets the blue venom blots;<BR>
His roaring fills the flitting air around.<BR>
Thus, when an ox receives a glancing wound,<BR>
He breaks his bands, the fatal altar flies,<BR>
And with loud bellowings breaks the yielding skies.<BR>
Their tasks perform'd, the serpents quit their prey,<BR>
And to the tow'r of Pallas make their way:<BR>
Couch'd at her feet, they lie protected there<BR>
By her large buckler and protended spear.<BR>
Amazement seizes all; the gen'ral cry<BR>
Proclaims Laocoon justly doom'd to die,<BR>
Whose hand the will of Pallas had withstood,<BR>
And dared to violate the sacred wood.<BR>
All vote t' admit the steed, that vows be paid<BR>
And incense offer'd to th' offended maid.<BR>
A spacious breach is made; the town lies bare;<BR>
Some hoisting-levers, some the wheels prepare<BR>
And fasten to the horse's feet; the rest<BR>
With cables haul along th' unwieldly beast.<BR>
Each on his fellow for assistance calls;<BR>
At length the fatal fabric mounts the walls,<BR>
Big with destruction. Boys with chaplets crown'd,<BR>
And choirs of virgins, sing and dance around.<BR>
Thus rais'd aloft, and then descending down,<BR>
It enters o'er our heads, and threats the town.<BR>
O sacred city, built by hands divine!<BR>
O valiant heroes of the Trojan line!<BR>
Four times he struck: as oft the clashing sound<BR>
Of arms was heard, and inward groans rebound.<BR>
Yet, mad with zeal, and blinded with our fate,<BR>
We haul along the horse in solemn state;<BR>
Then place the dire portent within the tow'r.<BR>
Cassandra cried, and curs'd th' unhappy hour;<BR>
Foretold our fate; but, by the god's decree,<BR>
All heard, and none believ'd the prophecy.<BR>
With branches we the fanes adorn, and waste,<BR>
In jollity, the day ordain'd to be the last.<BR>
Meantime the rapid heav'ns roll'd down the light,<BR>
And on the shaded ocean rush'd the night;<BR>
Our men, secure, nor guards nor sentries held,<BR>
But easy sleep their weary limbs compell'd.<BR>
The Grecians had embark'd their naval pow'rs<BR>
From Tenedos, and sought our well-known shores,<BR>
Safe under covert of the silent night,<BR>
And guided by th' imperial galley's light;<BR>
When Sinon, favor'd by the partial gods,<BR>
Unlock'd the horse, and op'd his dark abodes;<BR>
Restor'd to vital air our hidden foes,<BR>
Who joyful from their long confinement rose.<BR>
Tysander bold, and Sthenelus their guide,<BR>
And dire Ulysses down the cable slide:<BR>
Then Thoas, Athamas, and Pyrrhus haste;<BR>
Nor was the Podalirian hero last,<BR>
Nor injur'd Menelaus, nor the fam'd<BR>
Epeus, who the fatal engine fram'd.<BR>
A nameless crowd succeed; their forces join<BR>
T' invade the town, oppress'd with sleep and wine.<BR>
Those few they find awake first meet their fate;<BR>
Then to their fellows they unbar the gate.</P>
<P>"'T was in the dead of night, when sleep repairs<BR>
Our bodies worn with toils, our minds with cares,<BR>
When Hector's ghost before my sight appears:<BR>
A bloody shroud he seem'd, and bath'd in tears;<BR>
Such as he was, when, by Pelides slain,<BR>
Thessalian coursers dragg'd him o'er the plain.<BR>
Swoln were his feet, as when the thongs were thrust<BR>
Thro' the bor'd holes; his body black with dust;<BR>
Unlike that Hector who return'd from toils<BR>
Of war, triumphant, in Aeacian spoils,<BR>
Or him who made the fainting Greeks retire,<BR>
And launch'd against their navy Phrygian fire.<BR>
His hair and beard stood stiffen'd with his gore;<BR>
And all the wounds he for his country bore<BR>
Now stream'd afresh, and with new purple ran.<BR>
I wept to see the visionary man,<BR>
And, while my trance continued, thus began:<BR>
'O light of Trojans, and support of Troy,<BR>
Thy father's champion, and thy country's joy!<BR>
O, long expected by thy friends! from whence<BR>
Art thou so late return'd for our defense?<BR>
Do we behold thee, wearied as we are<BR>
With length of labors, and with toils of war?<BR>
After so many fun'rals of thy own<BR>
Art thou restor'd to thy declining town?<BR>
But say, what wounds are these? What new disgrace<BR>
Deforms the manly features of thy face?'</P>
<P>"To this the specter no reply did frame,<BR>
But answer'd to the cause for which he came,<BR>
And, groaning from the bottom of his breast,<BR>
This warning in these mournful words express'd:<BR>
'O goddess-born! escape, by timely flight,<BR>
The flames and horrors of this fatal night.<BR>
The foes already have possess'd the wall;<BR>
Troy nods from high, and totters to her fall.<BR>
Enough is paid to Priam's royal name,<BR>
More than enough to duty and to fame.<BR>
If by a mortal hand my father's throne<BR>
Could be defended, 't was by mine alone.<BR>
Now Troy to thee commends her future state,<BR>
And gives her gods companions of thy fate:<BR>
From their assistance walls expect,<BR>
Which, wand'ring long, at last thou shalt erect.'<BR>
He said, and brought me, from their blest abodes,<BR>
The venerable statues of the gods,<BR>
With ancient Vesta from the sacred choir,<BR>
The wreaths and relics of th' immortal fire.</P>
<P>"Now peals of shouts come thund'ring from afar,<BR>
Cries, threats, and loud laments, and mingled war:<BR>
The noise approaches, tho' our palace stood<BR>
Aloof from streets, encompass'd with a wood.<BR>
Louder, and yet more loud, I hear th' alarms<BR>
Of human cries distinct, and clashing arms.<BR>
Fear broke my slumbers; I no longer stay,<BR>
But mount the terrace, thence the town survey,<BR>
And hearken what the frightful sounds convey.<BR>
Thus, when a flood of fire by wind is borne,<BR>
Crackling it rolls, and mows the standing corn;<BR>
Or deluges, descending on the plains,<BR>
Sweep o'er the yellow year, destroy the pains<BR>
Of lab'ring oxen and the peasant's gains;<BR>
Unroot the forest oaks, and bear away<BR>
Flocks, folds, and trees, and undistinguish'd prey:<BR>
The shepherd climbs the cliff, and sees from far<BR>
The wasteful ravage of the wat'ry war.<BR>
Then Hector's faith was manifestly clear'd,<BR>
And Grecian frauds in open light appear'd.<BR>
The palace of Deiphobus ascends<BR>
In smoky flames, and catches on his friends.<BR>
Ucalegon burns next: the seas are bright<BR>
With splendor not their own, and shine with Trojan light.<BR>
New clamors and new clangors now arise,<BR>
The sound of trumpets mix'd with fighting cries.<BR>
With frenzy seiz'd, I run to meet th' alarms,<BR>
Resolv'd on death, resolv'd to die in arms,<BR>
But first to gather friends, with them t' oppose<BR>
(If fortune favor'd) and repel the foes;<BR>
Spurr'd by my courage, by my country fir'd,<BR>
With sense of honor and revenge inspir'd.</P>
<P>"Pantheus, Apollo's priest, a sacred name,<BR>
Had scap'd the Grecian swords, and pass'd the flame:<BR>
With relics loaden. to my doors he fled,<BR>
And by the hand his tender grandson led.<BR>
'What hope, O Pantheus? whither can we run?<BR>
Where make a stand? and what may yet be done?'<BR>
Scarce had I said, when Pantheus, with a groan:<BR>
'Troy is no more, and Ilium was a town!<BR>
The fatal day, th' appointed hour, is come,<BR>
When wrathful Jove's irrevocable doom<BR>
Transfers the Trojan state to Grecian hands.<BR>
The fire consumes the town, the foe commands;<BR>
And armed hosts, an unexpected force,<BR>
Break from the bowels of the fatal horse.<BR>
Within the gates, proud Sinon throws about<BR>
The flames; and foes for entrance press without,<BR>
With thousand others, whom I fear to name,<BR>
More than from Argos or Mycenae came.<BR>
To sev'ral posts their parties they divide;<BR>
Some block the narrow streets, some scour the wide:<BR>
The bold they kill, th' unwary they surprise;<BR>
Who fights finds death, and death finds him who flies.<BR>
The warders of the gate but scarce maintain<BR>
Th' unequal combat, and resist in vain.'</P>
<P>"I heard; and Heav'n, that well-born souls inspires,<BR>
Prompts me thro' lifted swords and rising fires<BR>
To run where clashing arms and clamor calls,<BR>
And rush undaunted to defend the walls.<BR>
Ripheus and Iph'itus by my side engage,<BR>
For valor one renown'd, and one for age.<BR>
Dymas and Hypanis by moonlight knew<BR>
My motions and my mien, and to my party drew;<BR>
With young Coroebus, who by love was led<BR>
To win renown and fair Cassandra's bed,<BR>
And lately brought his troops to Priam's aid,<BR>
Forewarn'd in vain by the prophetic maid.<BR>
Whom when I saw resolv'd in arms to fall,<BR>
And that one spirit animated all:<BR>
'Brave souls!' said I,- 'but brave, alas! in vain-<BR>
Come, finish what our cruel fates ordain.<BR>
You see the desp'rate state of our affairs,<BR>
And heav'n's protecting pow'rs are deaf to pray'rs.<BR>
The passive gods behold the Greeks defile<BR>
Their temples, and abandon to the spoil<BR>
Their own abodes: we, feeble few, conspire<BR>
To save a sinking town, involv'd in fire.<BR>
Then let us fall, but fall amidst our foes:<BR>
Despair of life the means of living shows.'<BR>
So bold a speech incourag'd their desire<BR>
Of death, and added fuel to their fire.</P>
<P>"As hungry wolves, with raging appetite,<BR>
Scour thro' the fields, nor fear the stormy night-<BR>
Their whelps at home expect the promis'd food,<BR>
And long to temper their dry chaps in blood-<BR>
So rush'd we forth at once; resolv'd to die,<BR>
Resolv'd, in death, the last extremes to try.<BR>
We leave the narrow lanes behind, and dare<BR>
Th' unequal combat in the public square:<BR>
Night was our friend; our leader was despair.<BR>
What tongue can tell the slaughter of that night?<BR>
What eyes can weep the sorrows and affright?<BR>
An ancient and imperial city falls:<BR>
The streets are fill'd with frequent funerals;<BR>
Houses and holy temples float in blood,<BR>
And hostile nations make a common flood.<BR>
Not only Trojans fall; but, in their turn,<BR>
The vanquish'd triumph, and the victors mourn.<BR>
Ours take new courage from despair and night:<BR>
Confus'd the fortune is, confus'd the fight.<BR>
All parts resound with tumults, plaints, and fears;<BR>
And grisly Death in sundry shapes appears.<BR>
Androgeos fell among us, with his band,<BR>
Who thought us Grecians newly come to land.<BR>
'From whence,' said he, 'my friends, this long delay?<BR>
You loiter, while the spoils are borne away:<BR>
Our ships are laden with the Trojan store;<BR>
And you, like truants, come too late ashore.'<BR>
He said, but soon corrected his mistake,<BR>
Found, by the doubtful answers which we make:<BR>
Amaz'd, he would have shunn'd th' unequal fight;<BR>
But we, more num'rous, intercept his flight.<BR>
As when some peasant, in a bushy brake,<BR>
Has with unwary footing press'd a snake;<BR>
He starts aside, astonish'd, when he spies<BR>
His rising crest, blue neck, and rolling eyes;<BR>
So from our arms surpris'd Androgeos flies.<BR>
In vain; for him and his we compass'd round,<BR>
Possess'd with fear, unknowing of the ground,<BR>
And of their lives an easy conquest found.<BR>
Thus Fortune on our first endeavor smil'd.<BR>
Coroebus then, with youthful hopes beguil'd,<BR>
Swoln with success, and a daring mind,<BR>
This new invention fatally design'd.<BR>
'My friends,' said he, 'since Fortune shows the way,<BR>
'T is fit we should th' auspicious guide obey.<BR>
For what has she these Grecian arms bestow'd,<BR>
But their destruction, and the Trojans' good?<BR>
Then change we shields, and their devices bear:<BR>
Let fraud supply the want of force in war.<BR>
They find us arms.' This said, himself he dress'd<BR>
In dead Androgeos' spoils, his upper vest,<BR>
His painted buckler, and his plumy crest.<BR>
Thus Ripheus, Dymas, all the Trojan train,<BR>
Lay down their own attire, and strip the slain.<BR>
Mix'd with the Greeks, we go with ill presage,<BR>
Flatter'd with hopes to glut our greedy rage;<BR>
Unknown, assaulting whom we blindly meet,<BR>
And strew with Grecian carcasses the street.<BR>
Thus while their straggling parties we defeat,<BR>
Some to the shore and safer ships retreat;<BR>
And some, oppress'd with more ignoble fear,<BR>
Remount the hollow horse, and pant in secret there.</P>
<P>"But, ah! what use of valor can be made,<BR>
When heav'n's propitious pow'rs refuse their aid!<BR>
Behold the royal prophetess, the fair<BR>
Cassandra, dragg'd by her dishevel'd hair,<BR>
Whom not Minerva's shrine, nor sacred bands,<BR>
In safety could protect from sacrilegious hands:<BR>
On heav'n she cast her eyes, she sigh'd, she cried-<BR>
'T was all she could- her tender arms were tied.<BR>
So sad a sight Coroebus could not bear;<BR>
But, fir'd with rage, distracted with despair,<BR>
Amid the barb'rous ravishers he flew:<BR>
Our leader's rash example we pursue.<BR>
But storms of stones, from the proud temple's height,<BR>
Pour down, and on our batter'd helms alight:<BR>
We from our friends receiv'd this fatal blow,<BR>
Who thought us Grecians, as we seem'd in show.<BR>
They aim at the mistaken crests, from high;<BR>
And ours beneath the pond'rous ruin lie.<BR>
Then, mov'd with anger and disdain, to see<BR>
Their troops dispers'd, the royal virgin free,<BR>
The Grecians rally, and their pow'rs unite,<BR>
With fury charge us, and renew the fight.<BR>
The brother kings with Ajax join their force,<BR>
And the whole squadron of Thessalian horse.</P>
<P>"Thus, when the rival winds their quarrel try,<BR>
Contending for the kingdom of the sky,<BR>
South, east, and west, on airy coursers borne;<BR>
The whirlwind gathers, and the woods are torn:<BR>
Then Nereus strikes the deep; the billows rise,<BR>
And, mix'd with ooze and sand, pollute the skies.<BR>
The troops we squander'd first again appear<BR>
From several quarters, and enclose the rear.<BR>
They first observe, and to the rest betray,<BR>
Our diff'rent speech; our borrow'd arms survey.<BR>
Oppress'd with odds, we fall; Coroebus first,<BR>
At Pallas' altar, by Peneleus pierc'd.<BR>
Then Ripheus follow'd, in th' unequal fight;<BR>
Just of his word, observant of the right:<BR>
Heav'n thought not so. Dymas their fate attends,<BR>
With Hypanis, mistaken by their friends.<BR>
Nor, Pantheus, thee, thy miter, nor the bands<BR>
Of awful Phoebus, sav'd from impious hands.<BR>
Ye Trojan flames, your testimony bear,<BR>
What I perform'd, and what I suffer'd there;<BR>
No sword avoiding in the fatal strife,<BR>
Expos'd to death, and prodigal of life;<BR>
Witness, ye heavens! I live not by my fault:<BR>
I strove to have deserv'd the death I sought.<BR>
But, when I could not fight, and would have died,<BR>
Borne off to distance by the growing tide,<BR>
Old Iphitus and I were hurried thence,<BR>
With Pelias wounded, and without defense.<BR>
New clamors from th' invested palace ring:<BR>
We run to die, or disengage the king.<BR>
So hot th' assault, so high the tumult rose,<BR>
While ours defend, and while the Greeks oppose<BR>
As all the Dardan and Argolic race<BR>
Had been contracted in that narrow space;<BR>
Or as all Ilium else were void of fear,<BR>
And tumult, war, and slaughter, only there.<BR>
Their targets in a tortoise cast, the foes,<BR>
Secure advancing, to the turrets rose:<BR>
Some mount the scaling ladders; some, more bold,<BR>
Swerve upwards, and by posts and pillars hold;<BR>
Their left hand gripes their bucklers in th' ascent,<BR>
While with their right they seize the battlement.<BR>
From their demolish'd tow'rs the Trojans throw<BR>
Huge heaps of stones, that, falling, crush the foe;<BR>
And heavy beams and rafters from the sides<BR>
(Such arms their last necessity provides)<BR>
And gilded roofs, come tumbling from on high,<BR>
The marks of state and ancient royalty.<BR>
The guards below, fix'd in the pass, attend<BR>
The charge undaunted, and the gate defend.<BR>
Renew'd in courage with recover'd breath,<BR>
A second time we ran to tempt our death,<BR>
To clear the palace from the foe, succeed<BR>
The weary living, and revenge the dead.</P>
<P>"A postern door, yet unobserv'd and free,<BR>
Join'd by the length of a blind gallery,<BR>
To the king's closet led: a way well known<BR>
To Hector's wife, while Priam held the throne,<BR>
Thro' which she brought Astyanax, unseen,<BR>
To cheer his grandsire and his grandsire's queen.<BR>
Thro' this we pass, and mount the tow'r, from whence<BR>
With unavailing arms the Trojans make defense.<BR>
From this the trembling king had oft descried<BR>
The Grecian camp, and saw their navy ride.<BR>
Beams from its lofty height with swords we hew,<BR>
Then, wrenching with our hands, th' assault renew;<BR>
And, where the rafters on the columns meet,<BR>
We push them headlong with our arms and feet.<BR>
The lightning flies not swifter than the fall,<BR>
Nor thunder louder than the ruin'd wall:<BR>
Down goes the top at once; the Greeks beneath<BR>
Are piecemeal torn, or pounded into death.<BR>
Yet more succeed, and more to death are sent;<BR>
We cease not from above, nor they below relent.<BR>
Before the gate stood Pyrrhus, threat'ning loud,<BR>
With glitt'ring arms conspicuous in the crowd.<BR>
So shines, renew'd in youth, the crested snake,<BR>
Who slept the winter in a thorny brake,<BR>
And, casting off his slough when spring returns,<BR>
Now looks aloft, and with new glory burns;<BR>
Restor'd with poisonous herbs, his ardent sides<BR>
Reflect the sun; and rais'd on spires he rides;<BR>
High o'er the grass, hissing he rolls along,<BR>
And brandishes by fits his forky tongue.<BR>
Proud Periphas, and fierce Automedon,<BR>
His father's charioteer, together run<BR>
To force the gate; the Scyrian infantry<BR>
Rush on in crowds, and the barr'd passage free.<BR>
Ent'ring the court, with shouts the skies they rend;<BR>
And flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend.<BR>
Himself, among the foremost, deals his blows,<BR>
And with his ax repeated strokes bestows<BR>
On the strong doors; then all their shoulders ply,<BR>
Till from the posts the brazen hinges fly.<BR>
He hews apace; the double bars at length<BR>
Yield to his ax and unresisted strength.<BR>
A mighty breach is made: the rooms conceal'd<BR>
Appear, and all the palace is reveal'd;<BR>
The halls of audience, and of public state,<BR>
And where the lonely queen in secret sate.<BR>
Arm'd soldiers now by trembling maids are seen,<BR>
With not a door, and scarce a space, between.<BR>
The house is fill'd with loud laments and cries,<BR>
And shrieks of women rend the vaulted skies;<BR>
The fearful matrons run from place to place,<BR>
And kiss the thresholds, and the posts embrace.<BR>
The fatal work inhuman Pyrrhus plies,<BR>
And all his father sparkles in his eyes;<BR>
Nor bars, nor fighting guards, his force sustain:<BR>
The bars are broken, and the guards are slain.<BR>
In rush the Greeks, and all the apartments fill;<BR>
Those few defendants whom they find, they kill.<BR>
Not with so fierce a rage the foaming flood<BR>
Roars, when he finds his rapid course withstood;<BR>
Bears down the dams with unresisted sway,<BR>
And sweeps the cattle and the cots away.<BR>
These eyes beheld him when he march'd between<BR>
The brother kings: I saw th' unhappy queen,<BR>
The hundred wives, and where old Priam stood,<BR>
To stain his hallow'd altar with his brood.<BR>
The fifty nuptial beds (such hopes had he,<BR>
So large a promise, of a progeny),<BR>
The posts, of plated gold, and hung with spoils,<BR>
Fell the reward of the proud victor's toils.<BR>
Where'er the raging fire had left a space,<BR>
The Grecians enter and possess the place.</P>
<P>"Perhaps you may of Priam's fate enquire.<BR>
He, when he saw his regal town on fire,<BR>
His ruin'd palace, and his ent'ring foes,<BR>
On ev'ry side inevitable woes,<BR>
In arms, disus'd, invests his limbs, decay'd,<BR>
Like them, with age; a late and useless aid.<BR>
His feeble shoulders scarce the weight sustain;<BR>
Loaded, not arm'd, he creeps along with pain,<BR>
Despairing of success, ambitious to be slain!<BR>
Uncover'd but by heav'n, there stood in view<BR>
An altar; near the hearth a laurel grew,<BR>
Dodder'd with age, whose boughs encompass round<BR>
The household gods, and shade the holy ground.<BR>
Here Hecuba, with all her helpless train<BR>
Of dames, for shelter sought, but sought in vain.<BR>
Driv'n like a flock of doves along the sky,<BR>
Their images they hug, and to their altars fly.<BR>
The Queen, when she beheld her trembling lord,<BR>
And hanging by his side a heavy sword,<BR>
'What rage,' she cried, 'has seiz'd my husband's mind?<BR>
What arms are these, and to what use design'd?<BR>
These times want other aids! Were Hector here,<BR>
Ev'n Hector now in vain, like Priam, would appear.<BR>
With us, one common shelter thou shalt find,<BR>
Or in one common fate with us be join'd.'<BR>
She said, and with a last salute embrac'd<BR>
The poor old man, and by the laurel plac'd.<BR>
Behold! Polites, one of Priam's sons,<BR>
Pursued by Pyrrhus, there for safety runs.<BR>
Thro' swords and foes, amaz'd and hurt, he flies<BR>
Thro' empty courts and open galleries.<BR>
Him Pyrrhus, urging with his lance, pursues,<BR>
And often reaches, and his thrusts renews.<BR>
The youth, transfix'd, with lamentable cries,<BR>
Expires before his wretched parent's eyes:<BR>
Whom gasping at his feet when Priam saw,<BR>
The fear of death gave place to nature's law;<BR>
And, shaking more with anger than with age,<BR>
'The gods,' said he, 'requite thy brutal rage!<BR>
As sure they will, barbarian, sure they must,<BR>
If there be gods in heav'n, and gods be just-<BR>
Who tak'st in wrongs an insolent delight;<BR>
With a son's death t' infect a father's sight.<BR>
Not he, whom thou and lying fame conspire<BR>
To call thee his- not he, thy vaunted sire,<BR>
Thus us'd my wretched age: the gods he fear'd,<BR>
The laws of nature and of nations heard.<BR>
He cheer'd my sorrows, and, for sums of gold,<BR>
The bloodless carcass of my Hector sold;<BR>
Pitied the woes a parent underwent,<BR>
And sent me back in safety from his tent.'</P>
<P>"This said, his feeble hand a javelin threw,<BR>
Which, flutt'ring, seem'd to loiter as it flew:<BR>
Just, and but barely, to the mark it held,<BR>
And faintly tinkled on the brazen shield.</P>
<P>"Then Pyrrhus thus: 'Go thou from me to fate,<BR>
And to my father my foul deeds relate.<BR>
Now die!' With that he dragg'd the trembling sire,<BR>
Slidd'ring thro' clotter'd blood and holy mire,<BR>
(The mingled paste his murder'd son had made,)<BR>
Haul'd from beneath the violated shade,<BR>
And on the sacred pile the royal victim laid.<BR>
His right hand held his bloody falchion bare,<BR>
His left he twisted in his hoary hair;<BR>
Then, with a speeding thrust, his heart he found:<BR>
The lukewarm blood came rushing thro' the wound,<BR>
And sanguine streams distain'd the sacred ground.<BR>
Thus Priam fell, and shar'd one common fate<BR>
With Troy in ashes, and his ruin'd state:<BR>
He, who the scepter of all Asia sway'd,<BR>
Whom monarchs like domestic slaves obey'd.<BR>
On the bleak shore now lies th' abandon'd king,<BR>
A headless carcass, and a nameless thing.</P>
<P>"Then, not before, I felt my cruddled blood<BR>
Congeal with fear, my hair with horror stood:<BR>
My father's image fill'd my pious mind,<BR>
Lest equal years might equal fortune find.<BR>
Again I thought on my forsaken wife,<BR>
And trembled for my son's abandon'd life.<BR>
I look'd about, but found myself alone,<BR>
Deserted at my need! My friends were gone.<BR>
Some spent with toil, some with despair oppress'd,<BR>
Leap'd headlong from the heights; the flames consum'd the rest.<BR>
Thus, wand'ring in my way, without a guide,<BR>
The graceless Helen in the porch I spied<BR>
Of Vesta's temple; there she lurk'd alone;<BR>
Muffled she sate, and, what she could, unknown:<BR>
But, by the flames that cast their blaze around,<BR>
That common bane of Greece and Troy I found.<BR>
For Ilium burnt, she dreads the Trojan sword;<BR>
More dreads the vengeance of her injur'd lord;<BR>
Ev'n by those gods who refug'd her abhorr'd.<BR>
Trembling with rage, the strumpet I regard,<BR>
Resolv'd to give her guilt the due reward:<BR>
'Shall she triumphant sail before the wind,<BR>
And leave in flames unhappy Troy behind?<BR>
Shall she her kingdom and her friends review,<BR>
In state attended with a captive crew,<BR>
While unreveng'd the good old Priam falls,<BR>
And Grecian fires consume the Trojan walls?<BR>
For this the Phrygian fields and Xanthian flood<BR>
Were swell'd with bodies, and were drunk with blood?<BR>
'T is true, a soldier can small honor gain,<BR>
And boast no conquest, from a woman slain:<BR>
Yet shall the fact not pass without applause,<BR>
Of vengeance taken in so just a cause;<BR>
The punish'd crime shall set my soul at ease,<BR>
And murm'ring manes of my friends appease.'<BR>
Thus while I rave, a gleam of pleasing light<BR>
Spread o'er the place; and, shining heav'nly bright,<BR>
My mother stood reveal'd before my sight<BR>
Never so radiant did her eyes appear;<BR>
Not her own star confess'd a light so clear:<BR>
Great in her charms, as when on gods above<BR>
She looks, and breathes herself into their love.<BR>
She held my hand, the destin'd blow to break;<BR>
Then from her rosy lips began to speak:<BR>
'My son, from whence this madness, this neglect<BR>
Of my commands, and those whom I protect?<BR>
Why this unmanly rage? Recall to mind<BR>
Whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind.<BR>
Look if your helpless father yet survive,<BR>
Or if Ascanius or Creusa live.<BR>
Around your house the greedy Grecians err;<BR>
And these had perish'd in the nightly war,<BR>
But for my presence and protecting care.<BR>
Not Helen's face, nor Paris, was in fault;<BR>
But by the gods was this destruction brought.<BR>
Now cast your eyes around, while I dissolve<BR>
The mists and films that mortal eyes involve,<BR>
Purge from your sight the dross, and make you see<BR>
The shape of each avenging deity.<BR>
Enlighten'd thus, my just commands fulfil,<BR>
Nor fear obedience to your mother's will.<BR>
Where yon disorder'd heap of ruin lies,<BR>
Stones rent from stones; where clouds of dust arise-<BR>
Amid that smother Neptune holds his place,<BR>
Below the wall's foundation drives his mace,<BR>
And heaves the building from the solid base.<BR>
Look where, in arms, imperial Juno stands<BR>
Full in the Scaean gate, with loud commands,<BR>
Urging on shore the tardy Grecian bands.<BR>
See! Pallas, of her snaky buckler proud,<BR>
Bestrides the tow'r, refulgent thro' the cloud:<BR>
See! Jove new courage to the foe supplies,<BR>
And arms against the town the partial deities.<BR>
Haste hence, my son; this fruitless labor end:<BR>
Haste, where your trembling spouse and sire attend:<BR>
Haste; and a mother's care your passage shall befriend.'<BR>
She said, and swiftly vanish'd from my sight,<BR>
Obscure in clouds and gloomy shades of night.<BR>
I look'd, I listen'd; dreadful sounds I hear;<BR>
And the dire forms of hostile gods appear.<BR>
Troy sunk in flames I saw (nor could prevent),<BR>
And Ilium from its old foundations rent;<BR>
Rent like a mountain ash, which dar'd the winds,<BR>
And stood the sturdy strokes of lab'ring hinds.<BR>
About the roots the cruel ax resounds;<BR>
The stumps are pierc'd with oft-repeated wounds:<BR>
The war is felt on high; the nodding crown<BR>
Now threats a fall, and throws the leafy honors down.<BR>
To their united force it yields, tho' late,<BR>
And mourns with mortal groans th' approaching fate:<BR>
The roots no more their upper load sustain;<BR>
But down she falls, and spreads a ruin thro' the plain.</P>
<P>"Descending thence, I scape thro' foes and fire:<BR>
Before the goddess, foes and flames retire.<BR>
Arriv'd at home, he, for whose only sake,<BR>
Or most for his, such toils I undertake,<BR>
The good Anchises, whom, by timely flight,<BR>
I purpos'd to secure on Ida's height,<BR>
Refus'd the journey, resolute to die<BR>
And add his fun'rals to the fate of Troy,<BR>
Rather than exile and old age sustain.<BR>
'Go you, whose blood runs warm in ev'ry vein.<BR>
Had Heav'n decreed that I should life enjoy,<BR>
Heav'n had decreed to save unhappy Troy.<BR>
'T is, sure, enough, if not too much, for one,<BR>
Twice to have seen our Ilium overthrown.<BR>
Make haste to save the poor remaining crew,<BR>
And give this useless corpse a long adieu.<BR>
These weak old hands suffice to stop my breath;<BR>
At least the pitying foes will aid my death,<BR>
To take my spoils, and leave my body bare:<BR>
As for my sepulcher, let Heav'n take care.<BR>
'T is long since I, for my celestial wife<BR>
Loath'd by the gods, have dragg'd a ling'ring life;<BR>
Since ev'ry hour and moment I expire,<BR>
Blasted from heav'n by Jove's avenging fire.'<BR>
This oft repeated, he stood fix'd to die:<BR>
Myself, my wife, my son, my family,<BR>
Intreat, pray, beg, and raise a doleful cry-<BR>
'What, will he still persist, on death resolve,<BR>
And in his ruin all his house involve!'<BR>
He still persists his reasons to maintain;<BR>
Our pray'rs, our tears, our loud laments, are vain.</P>
<P>"Urg'd by despair, again I go to try<BR>
The fate of arms, resolv'd in fight to die:<BR>
'What hope remains, but what my death must give?<BR>
Can I, without so dear a father, live?<BR>
You term it prudence, what I baseness call:<BR>
Could such a word from such a parent fall?<BR>
If Fortune please, and so the gods ordain,<BR>
That nothing should of ruin'd Troy remain,<BR>
And you conspire with Fortune to be slain,<BR>
The way to death is wide, th' approaches near:<BR>
For soon relentless Pyrrhus will appear,<BR>
Reeking with Priam's blood- the wretch who slew<BR>
The son (inhuman) in the father's view,<BR>
And then the sire himself to the dire altar drew.<BR>
O goddess mother, give me back to Fate;<BR>
Your gift was undesir'd, and came too late!<BR>
Did you, for this, unhappy me convey<BR>
Thro' foes and fires, to see my house a prey?<BR>
Shall I my father, wife, and son behold,<BR>
Welt'ring in blood, each other's arms infold?<BR>
Haste! gird my sword, tho' spent and overcome:<BR>
'T is the last summons to receive our doom.<BR>
I hear thee, Fate; and I obey thy call!<BR>
Not unreveng'd the foe shall see my fall.<BR>
Restore me to the yet unfinish'd fight:<BR>
My death is wanting to conclude the night.'<BR>
Arm'd once again, my glitt'ring sword I wield,<BR>
While th' other hand sustains my weighty shield,<BR>
And forth I rush to seek th' abandon'd field.<BR>
I went; but sad Creusa stopp'd my way,<BR>
And cross the threshold in my passage lay,<BR>
Embrac'd my knees, and, when I would have gone,<BR>
Shew'd me my feeble sire and tender son:<BR>
'If death be your design, at least,' said she,<BR>
'Take us along to share your destiny.<BR>
If any farther hopes in arms remain,<BR>
This place, these pledges of your love, maintain.<BR>
To whom do you expose your father's life,<BR>
Your son's, and mine, your now forgotten wife!'<BR>
While thus she fills the house with clam'rous cries,<BR>
Our hearing is diverted by our eyes:<BR>
For, while I held my son, in the short space<BR>
Betwixt our kisses and our last embrace;<BR>
Strange to relate, from young Iulus' head<BR>
A lambent flame arose, which gently spread<BR>
Around his brows, and on his temples fed.<BR>
Amaz'd, with running water we prepare<BR>
To quench the sacred fire, and slake his hair;<BR>
But old Anchises, vers'd in omens, rear'd<BR>
His hands to heav'n, and this request preferr'd:<BR>
'If any vows, almighty Jove, can bend<BR>
Thy will; if piety can pray'rs commend,<BR>
Confirm the glad presage which thou art pleas'd to send.'<BR>
Scarce had he said, when, on our left, we hear<BR>
A peal of rattling thunder roll in air:<BR>
There shot a streaming lamp along the sky,<BR>
Which on the winged lightning seem'd to fly;<BR>
From o'er the roof the blaze began to move,<BR>
And, trailing, vanish'd in th' Idaean grove.<BR>
It swept a path in heav'n, and shone a guide,<BR>
Then in a steaming stench of sulphur died.</P>
<P>"The good old man with suppliant hands implor'd<BR>
The gods' protection, and their star ador'd.<BR>
'Now, now,' said he, 'my son, no more delay!<BR>
I yield, I follow where Heav'n shews the way.<BR>
Keep, O my country gods, our dwelling place,<BR>
And guard this relic of the Trojan race,<BR>
This tender child! These omens are your own,<BR>
And you can yet restore the ruin'd town.<BR>
At least accomplish what your signs foreshow:<BR>
I stand resign'd, and am prepar'd to go.'</P>
<P>"He said. The crackling flames appear on high.<BR>
And driving sparkles dance along the sky.<BR>
With Vulcan's rage the rising winds conspire,<BR>
And near our palace roll the flood of fire.<BR>
'Haste, my dear father, ('t is no time to wait,)<BR>
And load my shoulders with a willing freight.<BR>
Whate'er befalls, your life shall be my care;<BR>
One death, or one deliv'rance, we will share.<BR>
My hand shall lead our little son; and you,<BR>
My faithful consort, shall our steps pursue.<BR>
Next, you, my servants, heed my strict commands:<BR>
Without the walls a ruin'd temple stands,<BR>
To Ceres hallow'd once; a cypress nigh<BR>
Shoots up her venerable head on high,<BR>
By long religion kept; there bend your feet,<BR>
And in divided parties let us meet.<BR>
Our country gods, the relics, and the bands,<BR>
Hold you, my father, in your guiltless hands:<BR>
In me 't is impious holy things to bear,<BR>
Red as I am with slaughter, new from war,<BR>
Till in some living stream I cleanse the guilt<BR>
Of dire debate, and blood in battle spilt.'<BR>
Thus, ord'ring all that prudence could provide,<BR>
I clothe my shoulders with a lion's hide<BR>
And yellow spoils; then, on my bending back,<BR>
The welcome load of my dear father take;<BR>
While on my better hand Ascanius hung,<BR>
And with unequal paces tripp'd along.<BR>
Creusa kept behind; by choice we stray<BR>
Thro' ev'ry dark and ev'ry devious way.<BR>
I, who so bold and dauntless, just before,<BR>
The Grecian darts and shock of lances bore,<BR>
At ev'ry shadow now am seiz'd with fear,<BR>
Not for myself, but for the charge I bear;<BR>
Till, near the ruin'd gate arriv'd at last,<BR>
Secure, and deeming all the danger past,<BR>
A frightful noise of trampling feet we hear.<BR>
My father, looking thro' the shades, with fear,<BR>
Cried out: 'Haste, haste, my son, the foes are nigh;<BR>
Their swords and shining armor I descry.'<BR>
Some hostile god, for some unknown offense,<BR>
Had sure bereft my mind of better sense;<BR>
For, while thro' winding ways I took my flight,<BR>
And sought the shelter of the gloomy night,<BR>
Alas! I lost Creusa: hard to tell<BR>
If by her fatal destiny she fell,<BR>
Or weary sate, or wander'd with affright;<BR>
But she was lost for ever to my sight.<BR>
I knew not, or reflected, till I meet<BR>
My friends, at Ceres' now deserted seat.<BR>
We met: not one was wanting; only she<BR>
Deceiv'd her friends, her son, and wretched me.</P>
<P>"What mad expressions did my tongue refuse!<BR>
Whom did I not, of gods or men, accuse!<BR>
This was the fatal blow, that pain'd me more<BR>
Than all I felt from ruin'd Troy before.<BR>
Stung with my loss, and raving with despair,<BR>
Abandoning my now forgotten care,<BR>
Of counsel, comfort, and of hope bereft,<BR>
My sire, my son, my country gods I left.<BR>
In shining armor once again I sheathe<BR>
My limbs, not feeling wounds, nor fearing death.<BR>
Then headlong to the burning walls I run,<BR>
And seek the danger I was forc'd to shun.<BR>
I tread my former tracks; thro' night explore<BR>
Each passage, ev'ry street I cross'd before.<BR>
All things were full of horror and affright,<BR>
And dreadful ev'n the silence of the night.<BR>
Then to my father's house I make repair,<BR>
With some small glimpse of hope to find her there.<BR>
Instead of her, the cruel Greeks I met;<BR>
The house was fill'd with foes, with flames beset.<BR>
Driv'n on the wings of winds, whole sheets of fire,<BR>
Thro' air transported, to the roofs aspire.<BR>
From thence to Priam's palace I resort,<BR>
And search the citadel and desart court.<BR>
Then, unobserv'd, I pass by Juno's church:<BR>
A guard of Grecians had possess'd the porch;<BR>
There Phoenix and Ulysses watch prey,<BR>
And thither all the wealth of Troy convey:<BR>
The spoils which they from ransack'd houses brought,<BR>
And golden bowls from burning altars caught,<BR>
The tables of the gods, the purple vests,<BR>
The people's treasure, and the pomp of priests.<BR>
A rank of wretched youths, with pinion'd hands,<BR>
And captive matrons, in long order stands.<BR>
Then, with ungovern'd madness, I proclaim,<BR>
Thro' all the silent street, Creusa's name:<BR>
Creusa still I call; at length she hears,<BR>
And sudden thro' the shades of night appears-<BR>
Appears, no more Creusa, nor my wife,<BR>
But a pale specter, larger than the life.<BR>
Aghast, astonish'd, and struck dumb with fear,<BR>
I stood; like bristles rose my stiffen'd hair.<BR>
Then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief<BR>
'Nor tears, nor cries, can give the dead relief.<BR>
Desist, my much-lov'd lord,'t indulge your pain;<BR>
You bear no more than what the gods ordain.<BR>
My fates permit me not from hence to fly;<BR>
Nor he, the great controller of the sky.<BR>
Long wand'ring ways for you the pow'rs decree;<BR>
On land hard labors, and a length of sea.<BR>
Then, after many painful years are past,<BR>
On Latium's happy shore you shall be cast,<BR>
Where gentle Tiber from his bed beholds<BR>
The flow'ry meadows, and the feeding folds.<BR>
There end your toils; and there your fates provide<BR>
A quiet kingdom, and a royal bride:<BR>
There fortune shall the Trojan line restore,<BR>
And you for lost Creusa weep no more.<BR>
Fear not that I shall watch, with servile shame,<BR>
Th' imperious looks of some proud Grecian dame;<BR>
Or, stooping to the victor's lust, disgrace<BR>
My goddess mother, or my royal race.<BR>
And now, farewell! The parent of the gods<BR>
Restrains my fleeting soul in her abodes:<BR>
I trust our common issue to your care.'<BR>
She said, and gliding pass'd unseen in air.<BR>
I strove to speak: but horror tied my tongue;<BR>
And thrice about her neck my arms I flung,<BR>
And, thrice deceiv'd, on vain embraces hung.<BR>
Light as an empty dream at break of day,<BR>
Or as a blast of wind, she rush'd away.</P>
<P>"Thus having pass'd the night in fruitless pain,<BR>
I to my longing friends return again,<BR>
Amaz'd th' augmented number to behold,<BR>
Of men and matrons mix'd, of young and old;<BR>
A wretched exil'd crew together brought,<BR>
With arms appointed, and with treasure fraught,<BR>
Resolv'd, and willing, under my command,<BR>
To run all hazards both of sea and land.<BR>
The Morn began, from Ida, to display<BR>
Her rosy cheeks; and Phosphor led the day:<BR>
Before the gates the Grecians took their post,<BR>
And all pretense of late relief was lost.<BR>
I yield to Fate, unwillingly retire,<BR>
And, loaded, up the hill convey my sire."</P>
