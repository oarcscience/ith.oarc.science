<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">BOOK VIII</H1>
<P>When Turnus had assembled all his pow'rs,<BR>
His standard planted on Laurentum's tow'rs;<BR>
When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar,<BR>
Had giv'n the signal of approaching war,<BR>
Had rous'd the neighing steeds to scour the fields,<BR>
While the fierce riders clatter'd on their shields;<BR>
Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare<BR>
To join th' allies, and headlong rush to war.<BR>
Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd,<BR>
With bold Mezentius, who blasphem'd aloud.<BR>
These thro' the country took their wasteful course,<BR>
The fields to forage, and to gather force.<BR>
Then Venulus to Diomede they send,<BR>
To beg his aid Ausonia to defend,<BR>
Declare the common danger, and inform<BR>
The Grecian leader of the growing storm:<BR>
Aeneas, landed on the Latian coast,<BR>
With banish'd gods, and with a baffled host,<BR>
Yet now aspir'd to conquest of the state,<BR>
And claim'd a title from the gods and fate;<BR>
What num'rous nations in his quarrel came,<BR>
And how they spread his formidable name.<BR>
What he design'd, what mischief might arise,<BR>
If fortune favor'd his first enterprise,<BR>
Was left for him to weigh, whose equal fears,<BR>
And common interest, was involv'd in theirs.</P>
<P>While Turnus and th' allies thus urge the war,<BR>
The Trojan, floating in a flood of care,<BR>
Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare.<BR>
This way and that he turns his anxious mind;<BR>
Thinks, and rejects the counsels he design'd;<BR>
Explores himself in vain, in ev'ry part,<BR>
And gives no rest to his distracted heart.<BR>
So, when the sun by day, or moon by night,<BR>
Strike on the polish'd brass their trembling light,<BR>
The glitt'ring species here and there divide,<BR>
And cast their dubious beams from side to side;<BR>
Now on the walls, now on the pavement play,<BR>
And to the ceiling flash the glaring day.</P>
<P>'T was night; and weary nature lull'd asleep<BR>
The birds of air, and fishes of the deep,<BR>
And beasts, and mortal men. The Trojan chief<BR>
Was laid on Tiber's banks, oppress'd with grief,<BR>
And found in silent slumber late relief.<BR>
Then, thro' the shadows of the poplar wood,<BR>
Arose the father of the Roman flood;<BR>
An azure robe was o'er his body spread,<BR>
A wreath of shady reeds adorn'd his head:<BR>
Thus, manifest to sight, the god appear'd,<BR>
And with these pleasing words his sorrow cheer'd:<BR>
"Undoubted offspring of ethereal race,<BR>
O long expected in this promis'd place!<BR>
Who thro' the foes hast borne thy banish'd gods,<BR>
Restor'd them to their hearths, and old abodes;<BR>
This is thy happy home, the clime where fate<BR>
Ordains thee to restore the Trojan state.<BR>
Fear not! The war shall end in lasting peace,<BR>
And all the rage of haughty Juno cease.<BR>
And that this nightly vision may not seem<BR>
Th' effect of fancy, or an idle dream,<BR>
A sow beneath an oak shall lie along,<BR>
All white herself, and white her thirty young.<BR>
When thirty rolling years have run their race,<BR>
Thy son Ascanius, on this empty space,<BR>
Shall build a royal town, of lasting fame,<BR>
Which from this omen shall receive the name.<BR>
Time shall approve the truth. For what remains,<BR>
And how with sure success to crown thy pains,<BR>
With patience next attend. A banish'd band,<BR>
Driv'n with Evander from th' Arcadian land,<BR>
Have planted here, and plac'd on high their walls;<BR>
Their town the founder Pallanteum calls,<BR>
Deriv'd from Pallas, his great-grandsire's name:<BR>
But the fierce Latians old possession claim,<BR>
With war infesting the new colony.<BR>
These make thy friends, and on their aid rely.<BR>
To thy free passage I submit my streams.<BR>
Wake, son of Venus, from thy pleasing dreams;<BR>
And, when the setting stars are lost in day,<BR>
To Juno's pow'r thy just devotion pay;<BR>
With sacrifice the wrathful queen appease:<BR>
Her pride at length shall fall, her fury cease.<BR>
When thou return'st victorious from the war,<BR>
Perform thy vows to me with grateful care.<BR>
The god am I, whose yellow water flows<BR>
Around these fields, and fattens as it goes:<BR>
Tiber my name; among the rolling floods<BR>
Renown'd on earth, esteem'd among the gods.<BR>
This is my certain seat. In times to come,<BR>
My waves shall wash the walls of mighty Rome."</P>
<P>He said, and plung'd below. While yet he spoke,<BR>
His dream Aeneas and his sleep forsook.<BR>
He rose, and looking up, beheld the skies<BR>
With purple blushing, and the day arise.<BR>
Then water in his hollow palm he took<BR>
From Tiber's flood, and thus the pow'rs bespoke:<BR>
"Laurentian nymphs, by whom the streams are fed,<BR>
And Father Tiber, in thy sacred bed<BR>
Receive Aeneas, and from danger keep.<BR>
Whatever fount, whatever holy deep,<BR>
Conceals thy wat'ry stores; where'er they rise,<BR>
And, bubbling from below, salute the skies;<BR>
Thou, king of horned floods, whose plenteous urn<BR>
Suffices fatness to the fruitful corn,<BR>
For this thy kind compassion of our woes,<BR>
Shalt share my morning song and ev'ning vows.<BR>
But, O be present to thy people's aid,<BR>
And firm the gracious promise thou hast made!"<BR>
Thus having said, two galleys from his stores,<BR>
With care he chooses, mans, and fits with oars.<BR>
Now on the shore the fatal swine is found.<BR>
Wondrous to tell!- She lay along the ground:<BR>
Her well-fed offspring at her udders hung;<BR>
She white herself, and white her thirty young.<BR>
Aeneas takes the mother and her brood,<BR>
And all on Juno's altar are bestow'd.</P>
<P>The foll'wing night, and the succeeding day,<BR>
Propitious Tiber smooth'd his wat'ry way:<BR>
He roll'd his river back, and pois'd he stood,<BR>
A gentle swelling, and a peaceful flood.<BR>
The Trojans mount their ships; they put from shore,<BR>
Borne on the waves, and scarcely dip an oar.<BR>
Shouts from the land give omen to their course,<BR>
And the pitch'd vessels glide with easy force.<BR>
The woods and waters wonder at the gleam<BR>
Of shields, and painted ships that stem the stream.<BR>
One summer's night and one whole day they pass<BR>
Betwixt the greenwood shades, and cut the liquid glass.<BR>
The fiery sun had finish'd half his race,<BR>
Look'd back, and doubted in the middle space,<BR>
When they from far beheld the rising tow'rs,<BR>
The tops of sheds, and shepherds' lowly bow'rs,<BR>
Thin as they stood, which, then of homely clay,<BR>
Now rise in marble, from the Roman sway.<BR>
These cots (Evander's kingdom, mean and poor)<BR>
The Trojan saw, and turn'd his ships to shore.<BR>
'T was on a solemn day: th' Arcadian states,<BR>
The king and prince, without the city gates,<BR>
Then paid their off'rings in a sacred grove<BR>
To Hercules, the warrior son of Jove.<BR>
Thick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies,<BR>
And fat of entrails on his altar fries.</P>
<P>But, when they saw the ships that stemm'd the flood,<BR>
And glitter'd thro' the covert of the wood,<BR>
They rose with fear, and left th' unfinish'd feast,<BR>
Till dauntless Pallas reassur'd the rest<BR>
To pay the rites. Himself without delay<BR>
A jav'lin seiz'd, and singly took his way;<BR>
Then gain'd a rising ground, and call'd from far:<BR>
"Resolve me, strangers, whence, and what you are;<BR>
Your bus'ness here; and bring you peace or war?"<BR>
High on the stern Aeneas his stand,<BR>
And held a branch of olive in his hand,<BR>
While thus he spoke: "The Phrygians' arms you see,<BR>
Expell'd from Troy, provok'd in Italy<BR>
By Latian foes, with war unjustly made;<BR>
At first affianc'd, and at last betray'd.<BR>
This message bear: 'The Trojans and their chief<BR>
Bring holy peace, and beg the king's relief.'<BR>
Struck with so great a name, and all on fire,<BR>
The youth replies: "Whatever you require,<BR>
Your fame exacts. Upon our shores descend.<BR>
A welcome guest, and, what you wish, a friend."<BR>
He said, and, downward hasting to the strand,<BR>
Embrac'd the stranger prince, and join'd his hand.</P>
<P>Conducted to the grove, Aeneas broke<BR>
The silence first, and thus the king bespoke:<BR>
"Best of the Greeks, to whom, by fate's command,<BR>
I bear these peaceful branches in my hand,<BR>
Undaunted I approach you, tho' I know<BR>
Your birth is Grecian, and your land my foe;<BR>
From Atreus tho' your ancient lineage came,<BR>
And both the brother kings your kindred claim;<BR>
Yet, my self-conscious worth, your high renown,<BR>
Your virtue, thro' the neighb'ring nations blown,<BR>
Our fathers' mingled blood, Apollo's voice,<BR>
Have led me hither, less by need than choice.<BR>
Our founder Dardanus, as fame has sung,<BR>
And Greeks acknowledge, from Electra sprung:<BR>
Electra from the loins of Atlas came;<BR>
Atlas, whose head sustains the starry frame.<BR>
Your sire is Mercury, whom long before<BR>
On cold Cyllene's top fair Maia bore.<BR>
Maia the fair, on fame if we rely,<BR>
Was Atlas' daughter, who sustains the sky.<BR>
Thus from one common source our streams divide;<BR>
Ours is the Trojan, yours th' Areadian side.<BR>
Rais'd by these hopes, I sent no news before,<BR>
Nor ask'd your leave, nor did your faith implore;<BR>
But come, without a pledge, my own ambassador.<BR>
The same Rutulians, who with arms pursue<BR>
The Trojan race, are equal foes to you.<BR>
Our host expell'd, what farther force can stay<BR>
The victor troops from universal sway?<BR>
Then will they stretch their pow'r athwart the land,<BR>
And either sea from side to side command.<BR>
Receive our offer'd faith, and give us thine;<BR>
Ours is a gen'rous and experienc'd line:<BR>
We want not hearts nor bodies for the war;<BR>
In council cautious, and in fields we dare."</P>
<P>He said; and while spoke, with piercing eyes<BR>
Evander view'd the man with vast surprise,<BR>
Pleas'd with his action, ravish'd with his face:<BR>
Then answer'd briefly, with a royal grace:<BR>
"O valiant leader of the Trojan line,<BR>
In whom the features of thy father shine,<BR>
How I recall Anchises! how I see<BR>
His motions, mien, and all my friend, in thee!<BR>
Long tho' it be, 't is fresh within my mind,<BR>
When Priam to his sister's court design'd<BR>
A welcome visit, with a friendly stay,<BR>
And thro' th' Arcadian kingdom took his way.<BR>
Then, past a boy, the callow down began<BR>
To shade my chin, and call me first a man.<BR>
I saw the shining train with vast delight,<BR>
And Priam's goodly person pleas'd my sight:<BR>
But great Anchises, far above the rest,<BR>
With awful wonder fir'd my youthful breast.<BR>
I long'd to join in friendship's holy bands<BR>
Our mutual hearts, and plight our mutual hands.<BR>
I first accosted him: I sued, I sought,<BR>
And, with a loving force, to Pheneus brought.<BR>
He gave me, when at length constrain'd to go,<BR>
A Lycian quiver and a Gnossian bow,<BR>
A vest embroider'd, glorious to behold,<BR>
And two rich bridles, with their bits of gold,<BR>
Which my son's coursers in obedience hold.<BR>
The league you ask, I offer, as your right;<BR>
And, when to-morrow's sun reveals the light,<BR>
With swift supplies you shall be sent away.<BR>
Now celebrate with us this solemn day,<BR>
Whose holy rites admit no long delay.<BR>
Honor our annual feast; and take your seat,<BR>
With friendly welcome, at a homely treat."<BR>
Thus having said, the bowls (remov'd for fear)<BR>
The youths replac'd, and soon restor'd the cheer.<BR>
On sods of turf he set the soldiers round:<BR>
A maple throne, rais'd higher from the ground,<BR>
Receiv'd the Trojan chief; and, o'er the bed,<BR>
A lion's shaggy hide for ornament they spread.<BR>
The loaves were serv'd in canisters; the wine<BR>
In bowls; the priest renew'd the rites divine:<BR>
Broil'd entrails are their food, and beef's continued chine.</P>
<P>But when the rage of hunger was repress'd,<BR>
Thus spoke Evander to his royal guest:<BR>
"These rites, these altars, and this feast, O king,<BR>
From no vain fears or superstition spring,<BR>
Or blind devotion, or from blinder chance,<BR>
Or heady zeal, or brutal ignorance;<BR>
But, sav'd from danger, with a grateful sense,<BR>
The labors of a god we recompense.<BR>
See, from afar, yon rock that mates the sky,<BR>
About whose feet such heaps of rubbish lie;<BR>
Such indigested ruin; bleak and bare,<BR>
How desart now it stands, expos'd in air!<BR>
'T was once a robber's den, inclos'd around<BR>
With living stone, and deep beneath the ground.<BR>
The monster Cacus, more than half a beast,<BR>
This hold, impervious to the sun, possess'd.<BR>
The pavement ever foul with human gore;<BR>
Heads, and their mangled members, hung the door.<BR>
Vulcan this plague begot; and, like his sire,<BR>
Black clouds he belch'd, and flakes of livid fire.<BR>
Time, long expected, eas'd us of our load,<BR>
And brought the needful presence of a god.<BR>
Th' avenging force of Hercules, from Spain,<BR>
Arriv'd in triumph, from Geryon slain:<BR>
Thrice liv'd the giant, and thrice liv'd in vain.<BR>
His prize, the lowing herds, Alcides drove<BR>
Near Tiber's bank, to graze the shady grove.<BR>
Allur'd with hope of plunder, and intent<BR>
By force to rob, by fraud to circumvent,<BR>
The brutal Cacus, as by chance they stray'd,<BR>
Four oxen thence, and four fair kine convey'd;<BR>
And, lest the printed footsteps might be seen,<BR>
He dragg'd 'em backwards to his rocky den.<BR>
The tracks averse a lying notice gave,<BR>
And led the searcher backward from the cave.</P>
<P>"Meantime the herdsman hero shifts his place,<BR>
To find fresh pasture and untrodden grass.<BR>
The beasts, who miss'd their mates, fill'd all around<BR>
With bellowings, and the rocks restor'd the sound.<BR>
One heifer, who had heard her love complain,<BR>
Roar'd from the cave, and made the project vain.<BR>
Alcides found the fraud; with rage he shook,<BR>
And toss'd about his head his knotted oak.<BR>
Swift as the winds, or Scythian arrows' flight,<BR>
He clomb, with eager haste, th' aerial height.<BR>
Then first we saw the monster mend his pace;<BR>
Fear his eyes, and paleness in his face,<BR>
Confess'd the god's approach. Trembling he springs,<BR>
As terror had increas'd his feet with wings;<BR>
Nor stay'd for stairs; but down the depth he threw<BR>
His body, on his back the door he drew<BR>
(The door, a rib of living rock; with pains<BR>
His father hew'd it out, and bound with iron chains):<BR>
He broke the heavy links, the mountain clos'd,<BR>
And bars and levers to his foe oppos'd.<BR>
The wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast;<BR>
The fierce avenger came with bounding haste;<BR>
Survey'd the mouth of the forbidden hold,<BR>
And here and there his raging eyes he roll'd.<BR>
He gnash'd his teeth; and thrice he compass'd round<BR>
With winged speed the circuit of the ground.<BR>
Thrice at the cavern's mouth he pull'd in vain,<BR>
And, panting, thrice desisted from his pain.<BR>
A pointed flinty rock, all bare and black,<BR>
Grew gibbous from behind the mountain's back;<BR>
Owls, ravens, all ill omens of the night,<BR>
Here built their nests, and hither wing'd their flight.<BR>
The leaning head hung threat'ning o'er the flood,<BR>
And nodded to the left. The hero stood<BR>
Adverse, with planted feet, and, from the right,<BR>
Tugg'd at the solid stone with all his might.<BR>
Thus heav'd, the fix'd foundations of the rock<BR>
Gave way; heav'n echo'd at the rattling shock.<BR>
Tumbling, it chok'd the flood: on either side<BR>
The banks leap backward, and the streams divide;<BR>
The sky shrunk upward with unusual dread,<BR>
And trembling Tiber div'd beneath his bed.<BR>
The court of Cacus stands reveal'd to sight;<BR>
The cavern glares with new-admitted light.<BR>
So the pent vapors, with a rumbling sound,<BR>
Heave from below, and rend the hollow ground;<BR>
A sounding flaw succeeds; and, from on high,<BR>
The gods with hate beheld the nether sky:<BR>
The ghosts repine at violated night,<BR>
And curse th' invading sun, and sicken at the sight.<BR>
The graceless monster, caught in open day,<BR>
Inclos'd, and in despair to fly away,<BR>
Howls horrible from underneath, and fills<BR>
His hollow palace with unmanly yells.<BR>
The hero stands above, and from afar<BR>
Plies him with darts, and stones, and distant war.<BR>
He, from his nostrils huge mouth, expires<BR>
Black clouds of smoke, amidst his father's fires,<BR>
Gath'ring, with each repeated blast, the night,<BR>
To make uncertain aim, and erring sight.<BR>
The wrathful god then plunges from above,<BR>
And, where in thickest waves the sparkles drove,<BR>
There lights; and wades thro' fumes, and gropes his way,<BR>
Half sing'd, half stifled, till he grasps his prey.<BR>
The monster, spewing fruitless flames, he found;<BR>
He squeez'd his throat; he writh'd his neck around,<BR>
And in a knot his crippled members bound;<BR>
Then from their sockets tore his burning eyes:<BR>
Roll'd on a heap, the breathless robber lies.<BR>
The doors, unbarr'd, receive the rushing day,<BR>
And thoro' lights disclose the ravish'd prey.<BR>
The bulls, redeem'd, breathe open air again.<BR>
Next, by the feet, they drag him from his den.<BR>
The wond'ring neighborhood, with glad surprise,<BR>
Behold his shagged breast, his giant size,<BR>
His mouth that flames no more, and his extinguish'd eyes.<BR>
From that auspicious day, with rites divine,<BR>
We worship at the hero's holy shrine.<BR>
Potitius first ordain'd these annual vows:<BR>
As priests, were added the Pinarian house,<BR>
Who rais'd this altar in the sacred shade,<BR>
Where honors, ever due, for ever shall be paid.<BR>
For these deserts, and this high virtue shown,<BR>
Ye warlike youths, your heads with garlands crown:<BR>
Fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood,<BR>
And with deep draughts invoke our common god."</P>
<P>This said, a double wreath Evander twin'd,<BR>
And poplars black and white his temples bind.<BR>
Then brims his ample bowl. With like design<BR>
The rest invoke the gods, with sprinkled wine.<BR>
Meantime the sun descended from the skies,<BR>
And the bright evening star began to rise.<BR>
And now the priests, Potitius at their head,<BR>
In skins of beasts involv'd, the long procession led;<BR>
Held high the flaming tapers in their hands,<BR>
As custom had prescrib'd their holy bands;<BR>
Then with a second course the tables load,<BR>
And with full chargers offer to the god.<BR>
The Salii sing, and cense his altars round<BR>
With Saban smoke, their heads with poplar bound-<BR>
One choir of old, another of the young,<BR>
To dance, and bear the burthen of the song.<BR>
The lay records the labors, and the praise,<BR>
And all th' immortal acts of Hercules:<BR>
First, how the mighty babe, when swath'd in bands,<BR>
The serpents strangled with his infant hands;<BR>
Then, as in years and matchless force he grew,<BR>
Th' Oechalian walls, and Trojan, overthrew.<BR>
Besides, a thousand hazards they relate,<BR>
Procur'd by Juno's and Eurystheus' hate:<BR>
"Thy hands, unconquer'd hero, could subdue<BR>
The cloud-born Centaurs, and the monster crew:<BR>
Nor thy resistless arm the bull withstood,<BR>
Nor he, the roaring terror of the wood.<BR>
The triple porter of the Stygian seat,<BR>
With lolling tongue, lay fawning at thy feet,<BR>
And, seiz'd with fear, forgot his mangled meat.<BR>
Th' infernal waters trembled at thy sight;<BR>
Thee, god, no face of danger could affright;<BR>
Not huge Typhoeus, nor th' unnumber'd snake,<BR>
Increas'd with hissing heads, in Lerna's lake.<BR>
Hail, Jove's undoubted son! an added grace<BR>
To heav'n and the great author of thy race!<BR>
Receive the grateful off'rings which we pay,<BR>
And smile propitious on thy solemn day!"<BR>
In numbers thus they sung; above the rest,<BR>
The den and death of Cacus crown the feast.<BR>
The woods to hollow vales convey the sound,<BR>
The vales to hills, and hills the notes rebound.<BR>
The rites perform'd, the cheerful train retire.</P>
<P>Betwixt young Pallas and his aged sire,<BR>
The Trojan pass'd, the city to survey,<BR>
And pleasing talk beguil'd the tedious way.<BR>
The stranger cast around his curious eyes,<BR>
New objects viewing still, with new surprise;<BR>
With greedy joy enquires of various things,<BR>
And acts and monuments of ancient kings.<BR>
Then thus the founder of the Roman tow'rs:<BR>
"These woods were first the seat of sylvan pow'rs,<BR>
Of Nymphs and Fauns, and salvage men, who took<BR>
Their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak.<BR>
Nor laws they knew, nor manners, nor the care<BR>
Of lab'ring oxen, or the shining share,<BR>
Nor arts of gain, nor what they gain'd to spare.<BR>
Their exercise the chase; the running flood<BR>
Supplied their thirst, the trees supplied their food.<BR>
Then Saturn came, who fled the pow'r of Jove,<BR>
Robb'd of his realms, and banish'd from above.<BR>
The men, dispers'd on hills, to towns he brought,<BR>
And laws ordain'd, and civil customs taught,<BR>
And Latium call'd the land where safe he lay<BR>
From his unduteous son, and his usurping sway.<BR>
With his mild empire, peace and plenty came;<BR>
And hence the golden times deriv'd their name.<BR>
A more degenerate and discolor'd age<BR>
Succeeded this, with avarice and rage.<BR>
Th' Ausonians then, and bold Sicanians came;<BR>
And Saturn's empire often chang'd the name.<BR>
Then kings, gigantic Tybris, and the rest,<BR>
With arbitrary sway the land oppress'd:<BR>
For Tiber's flood was Albula before,<BR>
Till, from the tyrant's fate, his name it bore.<BR>
I last arriv'd, driv'n from my native home<BR>
By fortune's pow'r, and fate's resistless doom.<BR>
Long toss'd on seas, I sought this happy land,<BR>
Warn'd by my mother nymph, and call'd by Heav'n's command."</P>
<P>Thus, walking on, he spoke, and shew'd the gate,<BR>
Since call'd Carmental by the Roman state;<BR>
Where stood an altar, sacred to the name<BR>
Of old Carmenta, the prophetic dame,<BR>
Who to her son foretold th' Aenean race,<BR>
Sublime in fame, and Rome's imperial place:<BR>
Then shews the forest, which, in after times,<BR>
Fierce Romulus for perpetrated crimes<BR>
A sacred refuge made; with this, the shrine<BR>
Where Pan below the rock had rites divine:<BR>
Then tells of Argus' death, his murder'd guest,<BR>
Whose grave and tomb his innocence attest.<BR>
Thence, to the steep Tarpeian rock he leads;<BR>
Now roof'd with gold, then thatch'd with homely reeds.<BR>
A reverent fear (such superstition reigns<BR>
Among the rude) ev'n then possess'd the swains.<BR>
Some god, they knew- what god, they could not tell-<BR>
Did there amidst the sacred horror dwell.<BR>
Th' Arcadians thought him Jove; and said they saw<BR>
The mighty Thund'rer with majestic awe,<BR>
Who took his shield, and dealt his bolts around,<BR>
And scatter'd tempests on the teeming ground.<BR>
Then saw two heaps of ruins, (once they stood<BR>
Two stately towns, on either side the flood,)<BR>
Saturnia's and Janicula's remains;<BR>
And either place the founder's name retains.<BR>
Discoursing thus together, they resort<BR>
Where poor Evander kept his country court.<BR>
They view'd the ground of Rome's litigious hall;<BR>
(Once oxen low'd, where now the lawyers bawl;)<BR>
Then, stooping, thro' the narrow gate they press'd,<BR>
When thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest:<BR>
"Mean as it is, this palace, and this door,<BR>
Receiv'd Alcides, then a conqueror.<BR>
Dare to be poor; accept our homely food,<BR>
Which feasted him, and emulate a god."<BR>
Then underneath a lowly roof he led<BR>
The weary prince, and laid him on a bed;<BR>
The stuffing leaves, with hides of bears o'erspread.<BR>
Now Night had shed her silver dews around,<BR>
And with her sable wings embrac'd the ground,<BR>
When love's fair goddess, anxious for her son,<BR>
(New tumults rising, and new wars begun,)<BR>
Couch'd with her husband in his golden bed,<BR>
With these alluring words invokes his aid;<BR>
And, that her pleasing speech his mind may move,<BR>
Inspires each accent with the charms of love:<BR>
"While cruel fate conspir'd with Grecian pow'rs,<BR>
To level with the ground the Trojan tow'rs,<BR>
I ask'd not aid th' unhappy to restore,<BR>
Nor did the succor of thy skill implore;<BR>
Nor urg'd the labors of my lord in vain,<BR>
A sinking empire longer to sustain,<BR>
Tho'much I ow'd to Priam's house, and more<BR>
The dangers of Aeneas did deplore.<BR>
But now, by Jove's command, and fate's decree,<BR>
His race is doom'd to reign in Italy:<BR>
With humble suit I beg thy needful art,<BR>
O still propitious pow'r, that rules my heart!<BR>
A mother kneels a suppliant for her son.<BR>
By Thetis and Aurora thou wert won<BR>
To forge impenetrable shields, and grace<BR>
With fated arms a less illustrious race.<BR>
Behold, what haughty nations are combin'd<BR>
Against the relics of the Phrygian kind,<BR>
With fire and sword my people to destroy,<BR>
And conquer Venus twice, in conqu'ring Troy."<BR>
She said; and straight her arms, of snowy hue,<BR>
About her unresolving husband threw.<BR>
Her soft embraces soon infuse desire;<BR>
His bones and marrow sudden warmth inspire;<BR>
And all the godhead feels the wonted fire.<BR>
Not half so swift the rattling thunder flies,<BR>
Or forky lightnings flash along the skies.<BR>
The goddess, proud of her successful wiles,<BR>
And conscious of her form, in secret smiles.</P>
<P>Then thus the pow'r, obnoxious to her charms,<BR>
Panting, and half dissolving in her arms:<BR>
"Why seek you reasons for a cause so just,<BR>
Or your own beauties or my love distrust?<BR>
Long since, had you requir'd my helpful hand,<BR>
Th' artificer and art you might command,<BR>
To labor arms for Troy: nor Jove, nor fate,<BR>
Confin'd their empire to so short a date.<BR>
And, if you now desire new wars to wage,<BR>
My skill I promise, and my pains engage.<BR>
Whatever melting metals can conspire,<BR>
Or breathing bellows, or the forming fire,<BR>
Is freely yours: your anxious fears remove,<BR>
And think no task is difficult to love."<BR>
Trembling he spoke; and, eager of her charms,<BR>
He snatch'd the willing goddess to his arms;<BR>
Till in her lap infus'd, he lay possess'd<BR>
Of full desire, and sunk to pleasing rest.<BR>
Now when the Night her middle race had rode,<BR>
And his first slumber had refresh'd the god-<BR>
The time when early housewives leave the bed;<BR>
When living embers on the hearth they spread,<BR>
Supply the lamp, and call the maids to rise-<BR>
With yawning mouths, and with half-open'd eyes,<BR>
They ply the distaff by the winking light,<BR>
And to their daily labor add the night:<BR>
Thus frugally they earn their children's bread,<BR>
And uncorrupted keep the nuptial bed-<BR>
Not less concern'd, nor at a later hour,<BR>
Rose from his downy couch the forging pow'r.</P>
<P>Sacred to Vulcan's name, an isle there lay,<BR>
Betwixt Sicilia's coasts and Lipare,<BR>
Rais'd high on smoking rocks; and, deep below,<BR>
In hollow caves the fires of Aetna glow.<BR>
The Cyclops here their heavy hammers deal;<BR>
Loud strokes, and hissings of tormented steel,<BR>
Are heard around; the boiling waters roar,<BR>
And smoky flames thro' fuming tunnels soar.<BR>
Hether the Father of the Fire, by night,<BR>
Thro' the brown air precipitates his flight.<BR>
On their eternal anvils here he found<BR>
The brethren beating, and the blows go round.<BR>
A load of pointless thunder now there lies<BR>
Before their hands, to ripen for the skies:<BR>
These darts, for angry Jove, they daily cast;<BR>
Consum'd on mortals with prodigious waste.<BR>
Three rays of writhen rain, of fire three more,<BR>
Of winged southern winds and cloudy store<BR>
As many parts, the dreadful mixture frame;<BR>
And fears are added, and avenging flame.<BR>
Inferior ministers, for Mars, repair<BR>
His broken axletrees and blunted war,<BR>
And send him forth again with furbish'd arms,<BR>
To wake the lazy war with trumpets' loud alarms.<BR>
The rest refresh the scaly snakes that fold<BR>
The shield of Pallas, and renew their gold.<BR>
Full on the crest the Gorgon's head they place,<BR>
With eyes that roll in death, and with distorted face.</P>
<P>"My sons," said Vulcan, "set your tasks aside;<BR>
Your strength and master-skill must now be tried.<BR>
Arms for a hero forge; arms that require<BR>
Your force, your speed, and all your forming fire."<BR>
He said. They set their former work aside,<BR>
And their new toils with eager haste divide.<BR>
A flood of molten silver, brass, and gold,<BR>
And deadly steel, in the large furnace roll'd;<BR>
Of this, their artful hands a shield prepare,<BR>
Alone sufficient to sustain the war.<BR>
Sev'n orbs within a spacious round they close:<BR>
One stirs the fire, and one the bellows blows.<BR>
The hissing steel is in the smithy drown'd;<BR>
The grot with beaten anvils groans around.<BR>
By turns their arms advance, in equal time;<BR>
By turns their hands descend, and hammers chime.<BR>
They turn the glowing mass with crooked tongs;<BR>
The fiery work proceeds, with rustic songs.</P>
<P>While, at the Lemnian god's command, they urge<BR>
Their labors thus, and ply th' Aeolian forge,<BR>
The cheerful morn salutes Evander's eyes,<BR>
And songs of chirping birds invite to rise.<BR>
He leaves his lowly bed: his buskins meet<BR>
Above his ankles; sandals sheathe his feet:<BR>
He sets his trusty sword upon his side,<BR>
And o'er his shoulder throws a panther's hide.<BR>
Two menial dogs before their master press'd.<BR>
Thus clad, and guarded thus, he seeks his kingly guest.<BR>
Mindful of promis'd aid, he mends his pace,<BR>
But meets Aeneas in the middle space.<BR>
Young Pallas did his father's steps attend,<BR>
And true Achates waited on his friend.<BR>
They join their hands; a secret seat they choose;<BR>
Th' Arcadian first their former talk renews:<BR>
"Undaunted prince, I never can believe<BR>
The Trojan empire lost, while you survive.<BR>
Command th' assistance of a faithful friend;<BR>
But feeble are the succors I can send.<BR>
Our narrow kingdom here the Tiber bounds;<BR>
That other side the Latian state surrounds,<BR>
Insults our walls, and wastes our fruitful grounds.<BR>
But mighty nations I prepare, to join<BR>
Their arms with yours, and aid your just design.<BR>
You come, as by your better genius sent,<BR>
And fortune seems to favor your intent.<BR>
Not far from hence there stands a hilly town,<BR>
Of ancient building, and of high renown,<BR>
Torn from the Tuscans by the Lydian race,<BR>
Who gave the name of Caere to the place,<BR>
Once Agyllina call'd. It flourish'd long,<BR>
In pride of wealth and warlike people strong,<BR>
Till curs'd Mezentius, in a fatal hour,<BR>
Assum'd the crown, with arbitrary pow'r.<BR>
What words can paint those execrable times,<BR>
The subjects' suff'rings, and the tyrant's crimes!<BR>
That blood, those murthers, O ye gods, replace<BR>
On his own head, and on his impious race!<BR>
The living and the dead at his command<BR>
Were coupled, face to face, and hand to hand,<BR>
Till, chok'd with stench, in loath'd embraces tied,<BR>
The ling'ring wretches pin'd away and died.<BR>
Thus plung'd in ills, and meditating more-<BR>
The people's patience, tir'd, no longer bore<BR>
The raging monster; but with arms beset<BR>
His house, and vengeance and destruction threat.<BR>
They fire his palace: while the flame ascends,<BR>
They force his guards, and execute his friends.<BR>
He cleaves the crowd, and, favor'd by the night,<BR>
To Turnus' friendly court directs his flight.<BR>
By just revenge the Tuscans set on fire,<BR>
With arms, their king to punishment require:<BR>
Their num'rous troops, now muster'd on the strand,<BR>
My counsel shall submit to your command.<BR>
Their navy swarms upon the coasts; they cry<BR>
To hoist their anchors, but the gods deny.<BR>
An ancient augur, skill'd in future fate,<BR>
With these foreboding words restrains their hate:<BR>
'Ye brave in arms, ye Lydian blood, the flow'r<BR>
Of Tuscan youth, and choice of all their pow'r,<BR>
Whom just revenge against Mezentius arms,<BR>
To seek your tyrant's death by lawful arms;<BR>
Know this: no native of our land may lead<BR>
This pow'rful people; seek a foreign head.'<BR>
Aw'd with these words, in camps they still abide,<BR>
And wait with longing looks their promis'd guide.<BR>
Tarchon, the Tuscan chief, to me has sent<BR>
Their crown, and ev'ry regal ornament:<BR>
The people join their own with his desire;<BR>
And all my conduct, as their king, require.<BR>
But the chill blood that creeps within my veins,<BR>
And age, and listless limbs unfit for pains,<BR>
And a soul conscious of its own decay,<BR>
Have forc'd me to refuse imperial sway.<BR>
My Pallas were more fit to mount the throne,<BR>
And should, but he's a Sabine mother's son,<BR>
And half a native; but, in you, combine<BR>
A manly vigor, and a foreign line.<BR>
Where Fate and smiling Fortune shew the way,<BR>
Pursue the ready path to sov'reign sway.<BR>
The staff of my declining days, my son,<BR>
Shall make your good or ill success his own;<BR>
In fighting fields from you shall learn to dare,<BR>
And serve the hard apprenticeship of war;<BR>
Your matchless courage and your conduct view,<BR>
And early shall begin t' admire and copy you.<BR>
Besides, two hundred horse he shall command;<BR>
Tho' few, a warlike and well-chosen band.<BR>
These in my name are listed; and my son<BR>
As many more has added in his own."</P>
<P>Scarce had he said; Achates and his guest,<BR>
With downcast eyes, their silent grief express'd;<BR>
Who, short of succors, and in deep despair,<BR>
Shook at the dismal prospect of the war.<BR>
But his bright mother, from a breaking cloud,<BR>
To cheer her issue, thunder'd thrice aloud;<BR>
Thrice forky lightning flash'd along the sky,<BR>
And Tyrrhene trumpets thrice were heard on high.<BR>
Then, gazing up, repeated peals they hear;<BR>
And, in a heav'n serene, refulgent arms appear:<BR>
Redd'ning the skies, and glitt'ring all around,<BR>
The temper'd metals clash, and yield a silver sound.<BR>
The rest stood trembling, struck with awe divine;<BR>
Aeneas only, conscious to the sign,<BR>
Presag'd th' event, and joyful view'd, above,<BR>
Th' accomplish'd promise of the Queen of Love.<BR>
Then, to th' Arcadian king: "This prodigy<BR>
(Dismiss your fear) belongs alone to me.<BR>
Heav'n calls me to the war: th' expected sign<BR>
Is giv'n of promis'd aid, and arms divine.<BR>
My goddess mother, whose indulgent care<BR>
Foresaw the dangers of the growing war,<BR>
This omen gave, when bright Vulcanian arms,<BR>
Fated from force of steel by Stygian charms,<BR>
Suspended, shone on high: she then foreshow'd<BR>
Approaching fights, and fields to float in blood.<BR>
Turnus shall dearly pay for faith forsworn;<BR>
And corps, and swords, and shields, on Tiber borne,<BR>
Shall choke his flood: now sound the loud alarms;<BR>
And, Latian troops, prepare your perjur'd arms."</P>
<P>He said, and, rising from his homely throne,<BR>
The solemn rites of Hercules begun,<BR>
And on his altars wak'd the sleeping fires;<BR>
Then cheerful to his household gods retires;<BR>
There offers chosen sheep. Th' Arcadian king<BR>
And Trojan youth the same oblations bring.<BR>
Next, of his men and ships he makes review;<BR>
Draws out the best and ablest of the crew.<BR>
Down with the falling stream the refuse run,<BR>
To raise with joyful news his drooping son.<BR>
Steeds are prepar'd to mount the Trojan band,<BR>
Who wait their leader to the Tyrrhene land.<BR>
A sprightly courser, fairer than the rest,<BR>
The king himself presents his royal guest:<BR>
A lion's hide his back and limbs infold,<BR>
Precious with studded work, and paws of gold.<BR>
Fame thro' the little city spreads aloud<BR>
Th' intended march, amid the fearful crowd:<BR>
The matrons beat their breasts, dissolve in tears,<BR>
And double their devotion in their fears.<BR>
The war at hand appears with more affright,<BR>
And rises ev'ry moment to the sight.</P>
<P>Then old Evander, with a close embrace,<BR>
Strain'd his departing friend; and tears o'erflow his face.<BR>
"Would Heav'n," said he, "my strength and youth recall,<BR>
Such as I was beneath Praeneste's wall;<BR>
Then when I made the foremost foes retire,<BR>
And set whole heaps of conquer'd shields on fire;<BR>
When Herilus in single fight I slew,<BR>
Whom with three lives Feronia did endue;<BR>
And thrice I sent him to the Stygian shore,<BR>
Till the last ebbing soul return'd no more-<BR>
Such if I stood renew'd, not these alarms,<BR>
Nor death, should rend me from my Pallas' arms;<BR>
Nor proud Mezentius, thus unpunish'd, boast<BR>
His rapes and murthers on the Tuscan coast.<BR>
Ye gods, and mighty Jove, in pity bring<BR>
Relief, and hear a father and a king!<BR>
If fate and you reserve these eyes, to see<BR>
My son return with peace and victory;<BR>
If the lov'd boy shall bless his father's sight;<BR>
If we shall meet again with more delight;<BR>
Then draw my life in length; let me sustain,<BR>
In hopes of his embrace, the worst of pain.<BR>
But if your hard decrees- which, O! I dread-<BR>
Have doom'd to death his undeserving head;<BR>
This, O this very moment, let me die!<BR>
While hopes and fears in equal balance lie;<BR>
While, yet possess'd of all his youthful charms,<BR>
I strain him close within these aged arms;<BR>
Before that fatal news my soul shall wound!"<BR>
He said, and, swooning, sunk upon the ground.<BR>
His servants bore him off, and softly laid<BR>
His languish'd limbs upon his homely bed.</P>
<P>The horsemen march; the gates are open'd wide;<BR>
Aeneas at their head, Achates by his side.<BR>
Next these, the Trojan leaders rode along;<BR>
Last follows in the rear th' Arcadian throng.<BR>
Young Pallas shone conspicuous o'er the rest;<BR>
Gilded his arms, embroider'd was his vest.<BR>
So, from the seas, exerts his radiant head<BR>
The star by whom the lights of heav'n are led;<BR>
Shakes from his rosy locks the pearly dews,<BR>
Dispels the darkness, and the day renews.<BR>
The trembling wives the walls and turrets crowd,<BR>
And follow, with their eyes, the dusty cloud,<BR>
Which winds disperse by fits, and shew from far<BR>
The blaze of arms, and shields, and shining war.<BR>
The troops, drawn up in beautiful array,<BR>
O'er heathy plains pursue the ready way.<BR>
Repeated peals of shouts are heard around;<BR>
The neighing coursers answer to the sound,<BR>
And shake with horny hoofs the solid ground.</P>
<P>A greenwood shade, for long religion known,<BR>
Stands by the streams that wash the Tuscan town,<BR>
Incompass'd round with gloomy hills above,<BR>
Which add a holy horror to the grove.<BR>
The first inhabitants of Grecian blood,<BR>
That sacred forest to Silvanus vow'd,<BR>
The guardian of their flocks and fields; and pay<BR>
Their due devotions on his annual day.<BR>
Not far from hence, along the river's side,<BR>
In tents secure, the Tuscan troops abide,<BR>
By Tarchon led. Now, from a rising ground,<BR>
Aeneas cast his wond'ring eyes around,<BR>
And all the Tyrrhene army had in sight,<BR>
Stretch'd on the spacious plain from left to right.<BR>
Thether his warlike train the Trojan led,<BR>
Refresh'd his men, and wearied horses fed.</P>
<P>Meantime the mother goddess, crown'd with charms,<BR>
Breaks thro' the clouds, and brings the fated arms.<BR>
Within a winding vale she finds her son,<BR>
On the cool river's banks, retir'd alone.<BR>
She shews her heav'nly form without disguise,<BR>
And gives herself to his desiring eyes.<BR>
"Behold," she said, "perform'd in ev'ry part,<BR>
My promise made, and Vulcan's labor'd art.<BR>
Now seek, secure, the Latian enemy,<BR>
And haughty Turnus to the field defy."<BR>
She said; and, having first her son embrac'd,<BR>
The radiant arms beneath an oak she plac'd,<BR>
Proud of the gift, he roll'd his greedy sight<BR>
Around the work, and gaz'd with vast delight.<BR>
He lifts, he turns, he poises, and admires<BR>
The crested helm, that vomits radiant fires:<BR>
His hands the fatal sword and corslet hold,<BR>
One keen with temper'd steel, one stiff with gold:<BR>
Both ample, flaming both, and beamy bright;<BR>
So shines a cloud, when edg'd with adverse light.<BR>
He shakes the pointed spear, and longs to try<BR>
The plated cuishes on his manly thigh;<BR>
But most admires the shield's mysterious mold,<BR>
And Roman triumphs rising on the gold:<BR>
For these, emboss'd, the heav'nly smith had wrought<BR>
(Not in the rolls of future fate untaught)<BR>
The wars in order, and the race divine<BR>
Of warriors issuing from the Julian line.<BR>
The cave of Mars was dress'd with mossy greens:<BR>
There, by the wolf, were laid the martial twins.<BR>
Intrepid on her swelling dugs they hung;<BR>
The foster dam loll'd out her fawning tongue:<BR>
They suck'd secure, while, bending back her head,<BR>
She lick'd their tender limbs, and form'd them as they fed.<BR>
Not far from thence new Rome appears, with games<BR>
Projected for the rape of Sabine dames.<BR>
The pit resounds with shrieks; a war succeeds,<BR>
For breach of public faith, and unexampled deeds.<BR>
Here for revenge the Sabine troops contend;<BR>
The Romans there with arms the prey defend.<BR>
Wearied with tedious war, at length they cease;<BR>
And both the kings and kingdoms plight the peace.<BR>
The friendly chiefs before Jove's altar stand,<BR>
Both arm'd, with each a charger in his hand:<BR>
A fatted sow for sacrifice is led,<BR>
With imprecations on the perjur'd head.<BR>
Near this, the traitor Metius, stretch'd between<BR>
Four fiery steeds, is dragg'd along the green,<BR>
By Tullus' doom: the brambles drink his blood,<BR>
And his torn limbs are left the vulture's food.<BR>
There, Porsena to Rome proud Tarquin brings,<BR>
And would by force restore the banish'd kings.<BR>
One tyrant for his fellow-tyrant fights;<BR>
The Roman youth assert their native rights.<BR>
Before the town the Tuscan army lies,<BR>
To win by famine, or by fraud surprise.<BR>
Their king, half-threat'ning, half-disdaining stood,<BR>
While Cocles broke the bridge, and stemm'd the flood.<BR>
The captive maids there tempt the raging tide,<BR>
Scap'd from their chains, with Cloelia for their guide.<BR>
High on a rock heroic Manlius stood,<BR>
To guard the temple, and the temple's god.<BR>
Then Rome was poor; and there you might behold<BR>
The palace thatch'd with straw, now roof'd with gold.<BR>
The silver goose before the shining gate<BR>
There flew, and, by her cackle, sav'd the state.<BR>
She told the Gauls' approach; th' approaching Gauls,<BR>
Obscure in night, ascend, and seize the walls.<BR>
The gold dissembled well their yellow hair,<BR>
And golden chains on their white necks they wear.<BR>
Gold are their vests; long Alpine spears they wield,<BR>
And their left arm sustains a length of shield.<BR>
Hard by, the leaping Salian priests advance;<BR>
And naked thro' the streets the mad Luperci dance,<BR>
In caps of wool; the targets dropp'd from heav'n.<BR>
Here modest matrons, in soft litters driv'n,<BR>
To pay their vows in solemn pomp appear,<BR>
And odorous gums in their chaste hands they bear.<BR>
Far hence remov'd, the Stygian seats are seen;<BR>
Pains of the damn'd, and punish'd Catiline<BR>
Hung on a rock- the traitor; and, around,<BR>
The Furies hissing from the nether ground.<BR>
Apart from these, the happy souls he draws,<BR>
And Cato's holy ghost dispensing laws.</P>
<P>Betwixt the quarters flows a golden sea;<BR>
But foaming surges there in silver play.<BR>
The dancing dolphins with their tails divide<BR>
The glitt'ring waves, and cut the precious tide.<BR>
Amid the main, two mighty fleets engage<BR>
Their brazen beaks, oppos'd with equal rage.<BR>
Actium surveys the well-disputed prize;<BR>
Leucate's wat'ry plain with foamy billows fries.<BR>
Young Caesar, on the stern, in armor bright,<BR>
Here leads the Romans and their gods to fight:<BR>
His beamy temples shoot their flames afar,<BR>
And o'er his head is hung the Julian star.<BR>
Agrippa seconds him, with prosp'rous gales,<BR>
And, with propitious gods, his foes assails:<BR>
A naval crown, that binds his manly brows,<BR>
The happy fortune of the fight foreshows.<BR>
Rang'd on the line oppos'd, Antonius brings<BR>
Barbarian aids, and troops of Eastern kings;<BR>
Th' Arabians near, and Bactrians from afar,<BR>
Of tongues discordant, and a mingled war:<BR>
And, rich in gaudy robes, amidst the strife,<BR>
His ill fate follows him- th' Egyptian wife.<BR>
Moving they fight; with oars and forky prows<BR>
The froth is gather'd, and the water glows.<BR>
It seems, as if the Cyclades again<BR>
Were rooted up, and justled in the main;<BR>
Or floating mountains floating mountains meet;<BR>
Such is the fierce encounter of the fleet.<BR>
Fireballs are thrown, and pointed jav'lins fly;<BR>
The fields of Neptune take a purple dye.<BR>
The queen herself, amidst the loud alarms,<BR>
With cymbals toss'd her fainting soldiers warms-<BR>
Fool as she was! who had not yet divin'd<BR>
Her cruel fate, nor saw the snakes behind.<BR>
Her country gods, the monsters of the sky,<BR>
Great Neptune, Pallas, and Love's Queen defy:<BR>
The dog Anubis barks, but barks in vain,<BR>
Nor longer dares oppose th' ethereal train.<BR>
Mars in the middle of the shining shield<BR>
Is grav'd, and strides along the liquid field.<BR>
The Dirae souse from heav'n with swift descent;<BR>
And Discord, dyed in blood, with garments rent,<BR>
Divides the prease: her steps Bellona treads,<BR>
And shakes her iron rod above their heads.<BR>
This seen, Apollo, from his Actian height,<BR>
Pours down his arrows; at whose winged flight<BR>
The trembling Indians and Egyptians yield,<BR>
And soft Sabaeans quit the wat'ry field.<BR>
The fatal mistress hoists her silken sails,<BR>
And, shrinking from the fight, invokes the gales.<BR>
Aghast she looks, and heaves her breast for breath,<BR>
Panting, and pale with fear of future death.<BR>
The god had figur'd her as driv'n along<BR>
By winds and waves, and scudding thro' the throng.<BR>
Just opposite, sad Nilus opens wide<BR>
His arms and ample bosom to the tide,<BR>
And spreads his mantle o'er the winding coast,<BR>
In which he wraps his queen, and hides the flying host.<BR>
The victor to the gods his thanks express'd,<BR>
And Rome, triumphant, with his presence bless'd.<BR>
Three hundred temples in the town he plac'd;<BR>
With spoils and altars ev'ry temple grac'd.<BR>
Three shining nights, and three succeeding days,<BR>
The fields resound with shouts, the streets with praise,<BR>
The domes with songs, the theaters with plays.<BR>
All altars flame: before each altar lies,<BR>
Drench'd in his gore, the destin'd sacrifice.<BR>
Great Caesar sits sublime upon his throne,<BR>
Before Apollo's porch of Parian stone;<BR>
Accepts the presents vow'd for victory,<BR>
And hangs the monumental crowns on high.<BR>
Vast crowds of vanquish'd nations march along,<BR>
Various in arms, in habit, and in tongue.<BR>
Here, Mulciber assigns the proper place<BR>
For Carians, and th' ungirt Numidian race;<BR>
Then ranks the Thracians in the second row,<BR>
With Scythians, expert in the dart and bow.<BR>
And here the tam'd Euphrates humbly glides,<BR>
And there the Rhine submits her swelling tides,<BR>
And proud Araxes, whom no bridge could bind;<BR>
The Danes' unconquer'd offspring march behind,<BR>
And Morini, the last of humankind.</P>
<P>These figures, on the shield divinely wrought,<BR>
By Vulcan labor'd, and by Venus brought,<BR>
With joy and wonder fill the hero's thought.<BR>
Unknown the names, he yet admires the grace,<BR>
And bears aloft the fame and fortune of his race.</P>
