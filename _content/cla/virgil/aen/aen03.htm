<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">BOOK III</H1>
<P>"When Heav'n had overturn'd the Trojan state<BR>
And Priam's throne, by too severe a fate;<BR>
When ruin'd Troy became the Grecians' prey,<BR>
And Ilium's lofty tow'rs in ashes lay;<BR>
Warn'd by celestial omens, we retreat,<BR>
To seek in foreign lands a happier seat.<BR>
Near old Antandros, and at Ida's foot,<BR>
The timber of the sacred groves we cut,<BR>
And build our fleet; uncertain yet to find<BR>
What place the gods for our repose assign'd.<BR>
Friends daily flock; and scarce the kindly spring<BR>
Began to clothe the ground, and birds to sing,<BR>
When old Anchises summon'd all to sea:<BR>
The crew my father and the Fates obey.<BR>
With sighs and tears I leave my native shore,<BR>
And empty fields, where Ilium stood before.<BR>
My sire, my son, our less and greater gods,<BR>
All sail at once, and cleave the briny floods.</P>
<P>"Against our coast appears a spacious land,<BR>
Which once the fierce Lycurgus did command,<BR>
(Thracia the name- the people bold in war;<BR>
Vast are their fields, and tillage is their care,)<BR>
A hospitable realm while Fate was kind,<BR>
With Troy in friendship and religion join'd.<BR>
I land; with luckless omens then adore<BR>
Their gods, and draw a line along the shore;<BR>
I lay the deep foundations of a wall,<BR>
And Aenos, nam'd from me, the city call.<BR>
To Dionaean Venus vows are paid,<BR>
And all the pow'rs that rising labors aid;<BR>
A bull on Jove's imperial altar laid.<BR>
Not far, a rising hillock stood in view;<BR>
Sharp myrtles on the sides, and cornels grew.<BR>
There, while I went to crop the sylvan scenes,<BR>
And shade our altar with their leafy greens,<BR>
I pull'd a plant- with horror I relate<BR>
A prodigy so strange and full of fate.<BR>
The rooted fibers rose, and from the wound<BR>
Black bloody drops distill'd upon the ground.<BR>
Mute and amaz'd, my hair with terror stood;<BR>
Fear shrunk my sinews, and congeal'd my blood.<BR>
Mann'd once again, another plant I try:<BR>
That other gush'd with the same sanguine dye.<BR>
Then, fearing guilt for some offense unknown,<BR>
With pray'rs and vows the Dryads I atone,<BR>
With all the sisters of the woods, and most<BR>
The God of Arms, who rules the Thracian coast,<BR>
That they, or he, these omens would avert,<BR>
Release our fears, and better signs impart.<BR>
Clear'd, as I thought, and fully fix'd at length<BR>
To learn the cause, I tugged with all my strength:<BR>
I bent my knees against the ground; once more<BR>
The violated myrtle ran with gore.<BR>
Scarce dare I tell the sequel: from the womb<BR>
Of wounded earth, and caverns of the tomb,<BR>
A groan, as of a troubled ghost, renew'd<BR>
My fright, and then these dreadful words ensued:<BR>
'Why dost thou thus my buried body rend?<BR>
O spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend!<BR>
Spare to pollute thy pious hands with blood:<BR>
The tears distil not from the wounded wood;<BR>
But ev'ry drop this living tree contains<BR>
Is kindred blood, and ran in Trojan veins.<BR>
O fly from this unhospitable shore,<BR>
Warn'd by my fate; for I am Polydore!<BR>
Here loads of lances, in my blood embrued,<BR>
Again shoot upward, by my blood renew'd.'</P>
<P>"My falt'ring tongue and shiv'ring limbs declare<BR>
My horror, and in bristles rose my hair.<BR>
When Troy with Grecian arms was closely pent,<BR>
Old Priam, fearful of the war's event,<BR>
This hapless Polydore to Thracia sent:<BR>
Loaded with gold, he sent his darling, far<BR>
From noise and tumults, and destructive war,<BR>
Committed to the faithless tyrant's care;<BR>
Who, when he saw the pow'r of Troy decline,<BR>
Forsook the weaker, with the strong to join;<BR>
Broke ev'ry bond of nature and of truth,<BR>
And murder'd, for his wealth, the royal youth.<BR>
O sacred hunger of pernicious gold!<BR>
What bands of faith can impious lucre hold?<BR>
Now, when my soul had shaken off her fears,<BR>
I call my father and the Trojan peers;<BR>
Relate the prodigies of Heav'n, require<BR>
What he commands, and their advice desire.<BR>
All vote to leave that execrable shore,<BR>
Polluted with the blood of Polydore;<BR>
But, ere we sail, his fun'ral rites prepare,<BR>
Then, to his ghost, a tomb and altars rear.<BR>
In mournful pomp the matrons walk the round,<BR>
With baleful cypress and blue fillets crown'd,<BR>
With eyes dejected, and with hair unbound.<BR>
Then bowls of tepid milk and blood we pour,<BR>
And thrice invoke the soul of Polydore.</P>
<P>"Now, when the raging storms no longer reign,<BR>
But southern gales invite us to the main,<BR>
We launch our vessels, with a prosp'rous wind,<BR>
And leave the cities and the shores behind.</P>
<P>"An island in th' Aegaean main appears;<BR>
Neptune and wat'ry Doris claim it theirs.<BR>
It floated once, till Phoebus fix'd the sides<BR>
To rooted earth, and now it braves the tides.<BR>
Here, borne by friendly winds, we come ashore,<BR>
With needful ease our weary limbs restore,<BR>
And the Sun's temple and his town adore.</P>
<P>"Anius, the priest and king, with laurel crown'd,<BR>
His hoary locks with purple fillets bound,<BR>
Who saw my sire the Delian shore ascend,<BR>
Came forth with eager haste to meet his friend;<BR>
Invites him to his palace; and, in sign<BR>
Of ancient love, their plighted hands they join.<BR>
Then to the temple of the god I went,<BR>
And thus, before the shrine, my vows present:<BR>
'Give, O Thymbraeus, give a resting place<BR>
To the sad relics of the Trojan race;<BR>
A seat secure, a region of their own,<BR>
A lasting empire, and a happier town.<BR>
Where shall we fix? where shall our labors end?<BR>
Whom shall we follow, and what fate attend?<BR>
Let not my pray'rs a doubtful answer find;<BR>
But in clear auguries unveil thy mind.'<BR>
Scarce had I said: he shook the holy ground,<BR>
The laurels, and the lofty hills around;<BR>
And from the tripos rush'd a bellowing sound.<BR>
Prostrate we fell; confess'd the present god,<BR>
Who gave this answer from his dark abode:<BR>
'Undaunted youths, go, seek that mother earth<BR>
From which your ancestors derive their birth.<BR>
The soil that sent you forth, her ancient race<BR>
In her old bosom shall again embrace.<BR>
Thro' the wide world th' Aeneian house shall reign,<BR>
And children's children shall the crown sustain.'<BR>
Thus Phoebus did our future fates disclose:<BR>
A mighty tumult, mix'd with joy, arose.</P>
<P>"All are concern'd to know what place the god<BR>
Assign'd, and where determin'd our abode.<BR>
My father, long revolving in his mind<BR>
The race and lineage of the Trojan kind,<BR>
Thus answer'd their demands: 'Ye princes, hear<BR>
Your pleasing fortune, and dispel your fear.<BR>
The fruitful isle of Crete, well known to fame,<BR>
Sacred of old to Jove's imperial name,<BR>
In the mid ocean lies, with large command,<BR>
And on its plains a hundred cities stand.<BR>
Another Ida rises there, and we<BR>
From thence derive our Trojan ancestry.<BR>
From thence, as 't is divulg'd by certain fame,<BR>
To the Rhoetean shores old Teucrus came;<BR>
There fix'd, and there the seat of empire chose,<BR>
Ere Ilium and the Trojan tow'rs arose.<BR>
In humble vales they built their soft abodes,<BR>
Till Cybele, the mother of the gods,<BR>
With tinkling cymbals charm'd th' Idaean woods,<BR>
She secret rites and ceremonies taught,<BR>
And to the yoke the savage lions brought.<BR>
Let us the land which Heav'n appoints, explore;<BR>
Appease the winds, and seek the Gnossian shore.<BR>
If Jove assists the passage of our fleet,<BR>
The third propitious dawn discovers Crete.'<BR>
Thus having said, the sacrifices, laid<BR>
On smoking altars, to the gods he paid:<BR>
A bull, to Neptune an oblation due,<BR>
Another bull to bright Apollo slew;<BR>
A milk-white ewe, the western winds to please,<BR>
And one coal-black, to calm the stormy seas.<BR>
Ere this, a flying rumor had been spread<BR>
That fierce Idomeneus from Crete was fled,<BR>
Expell'd and exil'd; that the coast was free<BR>
From foreign or domestic enemy.</P>
<P>"We leave the Delian ports, and put to sea;<BR>
By Naxos, fam'd for vintage, make our way;<BR>
Then green Donysa pass; and sail in sight<BR>
Of Paros' isle, with marble quarries white.<BR>
We pass the scatter'd isles of Cyclades,<BR>
That, scarce distinguish'd, seem to stud the seas.<BR>
The shouts of sailors double near the shores;<BR>
They stretch their canvas, and they ply their oars.<BR>
'All hands aloft! for Crete! for Crete!' they cry,<BR>
And swiftly thro' the foamy billows fly.<BR>
Full on the promis'd land at length we bore,<BR>
With joy descending on the Cretan shore.<BR>
With eager haste a rising town I frame,<BR>
Which from the Trojan Pergamus I name:<BR>
The name itself was grateful; I exhort<BR>
To found their houses, and erect a fort.<BR>
Our ships are haul'd upon the yellow strand;<BR>
The youth begin to till the labor'd land;<BR>
And I myself new marriages promote,<BR>
Give laws, and dwellings I divide by lot;<BR>
When rising vapors choke the wholesome air,<BR>
And blasts of noisome winds corrupt the year;<BR>
The trees devouring caterpillars burn;<BR>
Parch'd was the grass, and blighted was the corn:<BR>
Nor 'scape the beasts; for Sirius, from on high,<BR>
With pestilential heat infects the sky:<BR>
My men- some fall, the rest in fevers fry.<BR>
Again my father bids me seek the shore<BR>
Of sacred Delos, and the god implore,<BR>
To learn what end of woes we might expect,<BR>
And to what clime our weary course direct.</P>
<P>"'T was night, when ev'ry creature, void of cares,<BR>
The common gift of balmy slumber shares:<BR>
The statues of my gods (for such they seem'd),<BR>
Those gods whom I from flaming Troy redeem'd,<BR>
Before me stood, majestically bright,<BR>
Full in the beams of Phoebe's ent'ring light.<BR>
Then thus they spoke, and eas'd my troubled mind:<BR>
'What from the Delian god thou go'st to find,<BR>
He tells thee here, and sends us to relate.<BR>
Those pow'rs are we, companions of thy fate,<BR>
Who from the burning town by thee were brought,<BR>
Thy fortune follow'd, and thy safety wrought.<BR>
Thro' seas and lands as we thy steps attend,<BR>
So shall our care thy glorious race befriend.<BR>
An ample realm for thee thy fates ordain,<BR>
A town that o'er the conquer'd world shall reign.<BR>
Thou, mighty walls for mighty nations build;<BR>
Nor let thy weary mind to labors yield:<BR>
But change thy seat; for not the Delian god,<BR>
Nor we, have giv'n thee Crete for our abode.<BR>
A land there is, Hesperia call'd of old,<BR>
(The soil is fruitful, and the natives bold-<BR>
Th' Oenotrians held it once,) by later fame<BR>
Now call'd Italia, from the leader's name.<BR>
lasius there and Dardanus were born;<BR>
From thence we came, and thither must return.<BR>
Rise, and thy sire with these glad tidings greet.<BR>
Search Italy; for Jove denies thee Crete.'</P>
<P>"Astonish'd at their voices and their sight,<BR>
(Nor were they dreams, but visions of the night;<BR>
I saw, I knew their faces, and descried,<BR>
In perfect view, their hair with fillets tied;)<BR>
I started from my couch; a clammy sweat<BR>
On all my limbs and shiv'ring body sate.<BR>
To heav'n I lift my hands with pious haste,<BR>
And sacred incense in the flames I cast.<BR>
Thus to the gods their perfect honors done,<BR>
More cheerful, to my good old sire I run,<BR>
And tell the pleasing news. In little space<BR>
He found his error of the double race;<BR>
Not, as before he deem'd, deriv'd from Crete;<BR>
No more deluded by the doubtful seat:<BR>
Then said: 'O son, turmoil'd in Trojan fate!<BR>
Such things as these Cassandra did relate.<BR>
This day revives within my mind what she<BR>
Foretold of Troy renew'd in Italy,<BR>
And Latian lands; but who could then have thought<BR>
That Phrygian gods to Latium should be brought,<BR>
Or who believ'd what mad Cassandra taught?<BR>
Now let us go where Phoebus leads the way.'</P>
<P>"He said; and we with glad consent obey,<BR>
Forsake the seat, and, leaving few behind,<BR>
We spread our sails before the willing wind.<BR>
Now from the sight of land our galleys move,<BR>
With only seas around and skies above;<BR>
When o'er our heads descends a burst of rain,<BR>
And night with sable clouds involves the main;<BR>
The ruffling winds the foamy billows raise;<BR>
The scatter'd fleet is forc'd to sev'ral ways;<BR>
The face of heav'n is ravish'd from our eyes,<BR>
And in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies.<BR>
Cast from our course, we wander in the dark.<BR>
No stars to guide, no point of land to mark.<BR>
Ev'n Palinurus no distinction found<BR>
Betwixt the night and day; such darkness reign'd around.<BR>
Three starless nights the doubtful navy strays,<BR>
Without distinction, and three sunless days;<BR>
The fourth renews the light, and, from our shrouds,<BR>
We view a rising land, like distant clouds;<BR>
The mountain-tops confirm the pleasing sight,<BR>
And curling smoke ascending from their height.<BR>
The canvas falls; their oars the sailors ply;<BR>
From the rude strokes the whirling waters fly.<BR>
At length I land upon the Strophades,<BR>
Safe from the danger of the stormy seas.<BR>
Those isles are compass'd by th' Ionian main,<BR>
The dire abode where the foul Harpies reign,<BR>
Forc'd by the winged warriors to repair<BR>
To their old homes, and leave their costly fare.<BR>
Monsters more fierce offended Heav'n ne'er sent<BR>
From hell's abyss, for human punishment:<BR>
With virgin faces, but with wombs obscene,<BR>
Foul paunches, and with ordure still unclean;<BR>
With claws for hands, and looks for ever lean.</P>
<P>"We landed at the port, and soon beheld<BR>
Fat herds of oxen graze the flow'ry field,<BR>
And wanton goats without a keeper stray'd.<BR>
With weapons we the welcome prey invade,<BR>
Then call the gods for partners of our feast,<BR>
And Jove himself, the chief invited guest.<BR>
We spread the tables on the greensward ground;<BR>
We feed with hunger, and the bowls go round;<BR>
When from the mountain-tops, with hideous cry,<BR>
And clatt'ring wings, the hungry Harpies fly;<BR>
They snatch the meat, defiling all they find,<BR>
And, parting, leave a loathsome stench behind.<BR>
Close by a hollow rock, again we sit,<BR>
New dress the dinner, and the beds refit,<BR>
Secure from sight, beneath a pleasing shade,<BR>
Where tufted trees a native arbor made.<BR>
Again the holy fires on altars burn;<BR>
And once again the rav'nous birds return,<BR>
Or from the dark recesses where they lie,<BR>
Or from another quarter of the sky;<BR>
With filthy claws their odious meal repeat,<BR>
And mix their loathsome ordures with their meat.<BR>
I bid my friends for vengeance then prepare,<BR>
And with the hellish nation wage the war.<BR>
They, as commanded, for the fight provide,<BR>
And in the grass their glitt'ring weapons hide;<BR>
Then, when along the crooked shore we hear<BR>
Their clatt'ring wings, and saw the foes appear,<BR>
Misenus sounds a charge: we take th' alarm,<BR>
And our strong hands with swords and bucklers arm.<BR>
In this new kind of combat all employ<BR>
Their utmost force, the monsters to destroy.<BR>
In vain- the fated skin is proof to wounds;<BR>
And from their plumes the shining sword rebounds.<BR>
At length rebuff'd, they leave their mangled prey,<BR>
And their stretch'd pinions to the skies display.<BR>
Yet one remain'd- the messenger of Fate:<BR>
High on a craggy cliff Celaeno sate,<BR>
And thus her dismal errand did relate:<BR>
'What! not contented with our oxen slain,<BR>
Dare you with Heav'n an impious war maintain,<BR>
And drive the Harpies from their native reign?<BR>
Heed therefore what I say; and keep in mind<BR>
What Jove decrees, what Phoebus has design'd,<BR>
And I, the Furies' queen, from both relate-<BR>
You seek th' Italian shores, foredoom'd by fate:<BR>
Th' Italian shores are granted you to find,<BR>
And a safe passage to the port assign'd.<BR>
But know, that ere your promis'd walls you build,<BR>
My curses shall severely be fulfill'd.<BR>
Fierce famine is your lot for this misdeed,<BR>
Reduc'd to grind the plates on which you feed.'<BR>
She said, and to the neighb'ring forest flew.<BR>
Our courage fails us, and our fears renew.<BR>
Hopeless to win by war, to pray'rs we fall,<BR>
And on th' offended Harpies humbly call,<BR>
And whether gods or birds obscene they were,<BR>
Our vows for pardon and for peace prefer.<BR>
But old Anchises, off'ring sacrifice,<BR>
And lifting up to heav'n his hands and eyes,<BR>
Ador'd the greater gods: 'Avert,' said he,<BR>
'These omens; render vain this prophecy,<BR>
And from th' impending curse a pious people free!'</P>
<P>"Thus having said, he bids us put to sea;<BR>
We loose from shore our haulsers, and obey,<BR>
And soon with swelling sails pursue the wat'ry way.<BR>
Amidst our course, Zacynthian woods appear;<BR>
And next by rocky Neritos we steer:<BR>
We fly from Ithaca's detested shore,<BR>
And curse the land which dire Ulysses bore.<BR>
At length Leucate's cloudy top appears,<BR>
And the Sun's temple, which the sailor fears.<BR>
Resolv'd to breathe a while from labor past,<BR>
Our crooked anchors from the prow we cast,<BR>
And joyful to the little city haste.<BR>
Here, safe beyond our hopes, our vows we pay<BR>
To Jove, the guide and patron of our way.<BR>
The customs of our country we pursue,<BR>
And Trojan games on Actian shores renew.<BR>
Our youth their naked limbs besmear with oil,<BR>
And exercise the wrastlers' noble toil;<BR>
Pleas'd to have sail'd so long before the wind,<BR>
And left so many Grecian towns behind.<BR>
The sun had now fulfill'd his annual course,<BR>
And Boreas on the seas display'd his force:<BR>
I fix'd upon the temple's lofty door<BR>
The brazen shield which vanquish'd Abas bore;<BR>
The verse beneath my name and action speaks:<BR>
'These arms Aeneas took from conqu'ring Greeks.'<BR>
Then I command to weigh; the seamen ply<BR>
Their sweeping oars; the smoking billows fly.<BR>
The sight of high Phaeacia soon we lost,<BR>
And skimm'd along Epirus' rocky coast.</P>
<P>"Then to Chaonia's port our course we bend,<BR>
And, landed, to Buthrotus' heights ascend.<BR>
Here wondrous things were loudly blaz'd fame:<BR>
How Helenus reviv'd the Trojan name,<BR>
And reign'd in Greece; that Priam's captive son<BR>
Succeeded Pyrrhus in his bed and throne;<BR>
And fair Andromache, restor'd by fate,<BR>
Once more was happy in a Trojan mate.<BR>
I leave my galleys riding in the port,<BR>
And long to see the new Dardanian court.<BR>
By chance, the mournful queen, before the gate,<BR>
Then solemniz'd her former husband's fate.<BR>
Green altars, rais'd of turf, with gifts she crown'd,<BR>
And sacred priests in order stand around,<BR>
And thrice the name of hapless Hector sound.<BR>
The grove itself resembles Ida's wood;<BR>
And Simois seem'd the well-dissembled flood.<BR>
But when at nearer distance she beheld<BR>
My shining armor and my Trojan shield,<BR>
Astonish'd at the sight, the vital heat<BR>
Forsakes her limbs; her veins no longer beat:<BR>
She faints, she falls, and scarce recov'ring strength,<BR>
Thus, with a falt'ring tongue, she speaks at length:</P>
<P>"'Are you alive, O goddess-born ?' she said,<BR>
'Or if a ghost, then where is Hector's shade?'<BR>
At this, she cast a loud and frightful cry.<BR>
With broken words I made this brief reply:<BR>
'All of me that remains appears in sight;<BR>
I live, if living be to loathe the light.<BR>
No phantom; but I drag a wretched life,<BR>
My fate resembling that of Hector's wife.<BR>
What have you suffer'd since you lost your lord?<BR>
By what strange blessing are you now restor'd?<BR>
Still are you Hector's? or is Hector fled,<BR>
And his remembrance lost in Pyrrhus' bed?'<BR>
With eyes dejected, in a lowly tone,<BR>
After a modest pause she thus begun:</P>
<P>"'O only happy maid of Priam's race,<BR>
Whom death deliver'd from the foes' embrace!<BR>
Commanded on Achilles' tomb to die,<BR>
Not forc'd, like us, to hard captivity,<BR>
Or in a haughty master's arms to lie.<BR>
In Grecian ships unhappy we were borne,<BR>
Endur'd the victor's lust, sustain'd the scorn:<BR>
Thus I submitted to the lawless pride<BR>
Of Pyrrhus, more a handmaid than a bride.<BR>
Cloy'd with possession, he forsook my bed,<BR>
And Helen's lovely daughter sought to wed;<BR>
Then me to Trojan Helenus resign'd,<BR>
And his two slaves in equal marriage join'd;<BR>
Till young Orestes, pierc'd with deep despair,<BR>
And longing to redeem the promis'd fair,<BR>
Before Apollo's altar slew the ravisher.<BR>
By Pyrrhus' death the kingdom we regain'd:<BR>
At least one half with Helenus remain'd.<BR>
Our part, from Chaon, he Chaonia calls,<BR>
And names from Pergamus his rising walls.<BR>
But you, what fates have landed on our coast?<BR>
What gods have sent you, or what storms have toss'd?<BR>
Does young Ascanius life and health enjoy,<BR>
Sav'd from the ruins of unhappy Troy?<BR>
O tell me how his mother's loss he bears,<BR>
What hopes are promis'd from his blooming years,<BR>
How much of Hector in his face appears?'<BR>
She spoke; and mix'd her speech with mournful cries,<BR>
And fruitless tears came trickling from her eyes.</P>
<P>"At length her lord descends upon the plain,<BR>
In pomp, attended with a num'rous train;<BR>
Receives his friends, and to the city leads,<BR>
And tears of joy amidst his welcome sheds.<BR>
Proceeding on, another Troy I see,<BR>
Or, in less compass, Troy's epitome.<BR>
A riv'let by the name of Xanthus ran,<BR>
And I embrace the Scaean gate again.<BR>
My friends in porticoes were entertain'd,<BR>
And feasts and pleasures thro' the city reign'd.<BR>
The tables fill'd the spacious hall around,<BR>
And golden bowls with sparkling wine were crown'd.<BR>
Two days we pass'd in mirth, till friendly gales,<BR>
Blown from the supplied our swelling sails.<BR>
Then to the royal seer I thus began:<BR>
'O thou, who know'st, beyond the reach of man,<BR>
The laws of heav'n, and what the stars decree;<BR>
Whom Phoebus taught unerring prophecy,<BR>
From his own tripod, and his holy tree;<BR>
Skill'd in the wing'd inhabitants of air,<BR>
What auspices their notes and flights declare:<BR>
O say- for all religious rites portend<BR>
A happy voyage, and a prosp'rous end;<BR>
And ev'ry power and omen of the sky<BR>
Direct my course for destin'd Italy;<BR>
But only dire Celaeno, from the gods,<BR>
A dismal famine fatally forebodes-<BR>
O say what dangers I am first to shun,<BR>
What toils vanquish, and what course to run.'</P>
<P>"The prophet first with sacrifice adores<BR>
The greater gods; their pardon then implores;<BR>
Unbinds the fillet from his holy head;<BR>
To Phoebus, next, my trembling steps he led,<BR>
Full of religious doubts and awful dread.<BR>
Then, with his god possess'd, before the shrine,<BR>
These words proceeded from his mouth divine:<BR>
'O goddess-born, (for Heav'n's appointed will,<BR>
With greater auspices of good than ill,<BR>
Foreshows thy voyage, and thy course directs;<BR>
Thy fates conspire, and Jove himself protects,)<BR>
Of many things some few I shall explain,<BR>
Teach thee to shun the dangers of the main,<BR>
And how at length the promis'd shore to gain.<BR>
The rest the fates from Helenus conceal,<BR>
And Juno's angry pow'r forbids to tell.<BR>
First, then, that happy shore, that seems so nigh,<BR>
Will far from your deluded wishes fly;<BR>
Long tracts of seas divide your hopes from Italy:<BR>
For you must cruise along Sicilian shores,<BR>
And stem the currents with your struggling oars;<BR>
Then round th' Italian coast your navy steer;<BR>
And, after this, to Circe's island veer;<BR>
And, last, before your new foundations rise,<BR>
Must pass the Stygian lake, and view the nether skies.<BR>
Now mark the signs of future ease and rest,<BR>
And bear them safely treasur'd in thy breast.<BR>
When, in the shady shelter of a wood,<BR>
And near the margin of a gentle flood,<BR>
Thou shalt behold a sow upon the ground,<BR>
With thirty sucking young encompass'd round;<BR>
The dam and offspring white as falling snow-<BR>
These on thy city shall their name bestow,<BR>
And there shall end thy labors and thy woe.<BR>
Nor let the threaten'd famine fright thy mind,<BR>
For Phoebus will assist, and Fate the way will find.<BR>
Let not thy course to that ill coast be bent,<BR>
Which fronts from far th' Epirian continent:<BR>
Those parts are all by Grecian foes possess'd;<BR>
The salvage Locrians here the shores infest;<BR>
There fierce Idomeneus his city builds,<BR>
And guards with arms the Salentinian fields;<BR>
And on the mountain's brow Petilia stands,<BR>
Which Philoctetes with his troops commands.<BR>
Ev'n when thy fleet is landed on the shore,<BR>
And priests with holy vows the gods adore,<BR>
Then with a purple veil involve your eyes,<BR>
Lest hostile faces blast the sacrifice.<BR>
These rites and customs to the rest commend,<BR>
That to your pious race they may descend.</P>
<P>"'When, parted hence, the wind, that ready waits<BR>
For Sicily, shall bear you to the straits<BR>
Where proud Pelorus opes a wider way,<BR>
Tack to the larboard, and stand off to sea:<BR>
Veer starboard sea and land. Th' Italian shore<BR>
And fair Sicilia's coast were one, before<BR>
An earthquake caus'd the flaw: the roaring tides<BR>
The passage broke that land from land divides;<BR>
And where the lands retir'd, the rushing ocean rides.<BR>
Distinguish'd by the straits, on either hand,<BR>
Now rising cities in long order stand,<BR>
And fruitful fields: so much can time invade<BR>
The mold'ring work that beauteous Nature made.<BR>
Far on the right, her dogs foul Scylla hides:<BR>
Charybdis roaring on the left presides,<BR>
And in her greedy whirlpool sucks the tides;<BR>
Then spouts them from below: with fury driv'n,<BR>
The waves mount up and wash the face of heav'n.<BR>
But Scylla from her den, with open jaws,<BR>
The sinking vessel in her eddy draws,<BR>
Then dashes on the rocks. A human face,<BR>
And virgin bosom, hides her tail's disgrace:<BR>
Her parts obscene below the waves descend,<BR>
With dogs inclos'd, and in a dolphin end.<BR>
'T is safer, then, to bear aloof to sea,<BR>
And coast Pachynus, tho' with more delay,<BR>
Than once to view misshapen Scylla near,<BR>
And the loud yell of wat'ry wolves to hear.</P>
<P>"'Besides, if faith to Helenus be due,<BR>
And if prophetic Phoebus tell me true,<BR>
Do not this precept of your friend forget,<BR>
Which therefore more than once I must repeat:<BR>
Above the rest, great Juno's name adore;<BR>
Pay vows to Juno; Juno's aid implore.<BR>
Let gifts be to the mighty queen design'd,<BR>
And mollify with pray'rs her haughty mind.<BR>
Thus, at the length, your passage shall be free,<BR>
And you shall safe descend on Italy.<BR>
Arriv'd at Cumae, when you view the flood<BR>
Of black Avernus, and the sounding wood,<BR>
The mad prophetic Sibyl you shall find,<BR>
Dark in a cave, and on a rock reclin'd.<BR>
She sings the fates, and, in her frantic fits,<BR>
The notes and names, inscrib'd, to leafs commits.<BR>
What she commits to leafs, in order laid,<BR>
Before the cavern's entrance are display'd:<BR>
Unmov'd they lie; but, if a blast of wind<BR>
Without, or vapors issue from behind,<BR>
The leafs are borne aloft in liquid air,<BR>
And she resumes no more her museful care,<BR>
Nor gathers from the rocks her scatter'd verse,<BR>
Nor sets in order what the winds disperse.<BR>
Thus, many not succeeding, most upbraid<BR>
The madness of the visionary maid,<BR>
And with loud curses leave the mystic shade.</P>
<P>"'Think it not loss of time a while to stay,<BR>
Tho' thy companions chide thy long delay;<BR>
Tho' summon'd to the seas, tho' pleasing gales<BR>
Invite thy course, and stretch thy swelling sails:<BR>
But beg the sacred priestess to relate<BR>
With willing words, and not to write thy fate.<BR>
The fierce Italian people she will show,<BR>
And all thy wars, and all thy future woe,<BR>
And what thou may'st avoid, and what must undergo.<BR>
She shall direct thy course, instruct thy mind,<BR>
And teach thee how the happy shores to find.<BR>
This is what Heav'n allows me to relate:<BR>
Now part in peace; pursue thy better fate,<BR>
And raise, by strength of arms, the Trojan state.'</P>
<P>"This when the priest with friendly voice declar'd,<BR>
He gave me license, and rich gifts prepar'd:<BR>
Bounteous of treasure, he supplied my want<BR>
With heavy gold, and polish'd elephant;<BR>
Then Dodonaean caldrons put on board,<BR>
And ev'ry ship with sums of silver stor'd.<BR>
A trusty coat of mail to me he sent,<BR>
Thrice chain'd with gold, for use and ornament;<BR>
The helm of Pyrrhus added to the rest,<BR>
That flourish'd with a plume and waving crest.<BR>
Nor was my sire forgotten, nor my friends;<BR>
And large recruits he to my navy sends:<BR>
Men, horses, captains, arms, and warlike stores;<BR>
Supplies new pilots, and new sweeping oars.<BR>
Meantime, my sire commands to hoist our sails,<BR>
Lest we should lose the first auspicious gales.</P>
<P>"The prophet bless'd the parting crew, and last,<BR>
With words like these, his ancient friend embrac'd:<BR>
'Old happy man, the care of gods above,<BR>
Whom heav'nly Venus honor'd with her love,<BR>
And twice preserv'd thy life, when Troy was lost,<BR>
Behold from far the wish'd Ausonian coast:<BR>
There land; but take a larger compass round,<BR>
For that before is all forbidden ground.<BR>
The shore that Phoebus has design'd for you,<BR>
At farther distance lies, conceal'd from view.<BR>
Go happy hence, and seek your new abodes,<BR>
Blest in a son, and favor'd by the gods:<BR>
For I with useless words prolong your stay,<BR>
When southern gales have summon'd you away.'</P>
<P>"Nor less the queen our parting thence deplor'd,<BR>
Nor was less bounteous than her Trojan lord.<BR>
A noble present to my son she brought,<BR>
A robe with flow'rs on golden tissue wrought,<BR>
A phrygian vest; and loads with gifts beside<BR>
Of precious texture, and of Asian pride.<BR>
'Accept,' she said, 'these monuments of love,<BR>
Which in my youth with happier hands I wove:<BR>
Regard these trifles for the giver's sake;<BR>
'T is the last present Hector's wife can make.<BR>
Thou call'st my lost Astyanax to mind;<BR>
In thee his features and his form I find:<BR>
His eyes so sparkled with a lively flame;<BR>
Such were his motions; such was all his frame;<BR>
And ah! had Heav'n so pleas'd, his years had been the same.'</P>
<P>"With tears I took my last adieu, and said:<BR>
'Your fortune, happy pair, already made,<BR>
Leaves you no farther wish. My diff'rent state,<BR>
Avoiding one, incurs another fate.<BR>
To you a quiet seat the gods allow:<BR>
You have no shores to search, no seas to plow,<BR>
Nor fields of flying Italy to chase:<BR>
(Deluding visions, and a vain embrace!)<BR>
You see another Simois, and enjoy<BR>
The labor of your hands, another Troy,<BR>
With better auspice than her ancient tow'rs,<BR>
And less obnoxious to the Grecian pow'rs.<BR>
If e'er the gods, whom I with vows adore,<BR>
Conduct my steps to Tiber's happy shore;<BR>
If ever I ascend the Latian throne,<BR>
And build a city I may call my own;<BR>
As both of us our birth from Troy derive,<BR>
So let our kindred lines in concord live,<BR>
And both in acts of equal friendship strive.<BR>
Our fortunes, good or bad, shall be the same:<BR>
The double Troy shall differ but in name;<BR>
That what we now begin may never end,<BR>
But long to late posterity descend.'</P>
<P>"Near the Ceraunian rocks our course we bore;<BR>
The shortest passage to th' Italian shore.<BR>
Now had the sun withdrawn his radiant light,<BR>
And hills were hid in dusky shades of night:<BR>
We land, and, on the bosom Of the ground,<BR>
A safe retreat and a bare lodging found.<BR>
Close by the shore we lay; the sailors keep<BR>
Their watches, and the rest securely sleep.<BR>
The night, proceeding on with silent pace,<BR>
Stood in her noon, and view'd with equal face<BR>
Her steepy rise and her declining race.<BR>
Then wakeful Palinurus rose, to spy<BR>
The face of heav'n, and the nocturnal sky;<BR>
And listen'd ev'ry breath of air to try;<BR>
Observes the stars, and notes their sliding course,<BR>
The Pleiads, Hyads, and their wat'ry force;<BR>
And both the Bears is careful to behold,<BR>
And bright Orion, arm'd with burnish'd gold.<BR>
Then, when he saw no threat'ning tempest nigh,<BR>
But a sure promise of a settled sky,<BR>
He gave the sign to weigh; we break our sleep,<BR>
Forsake the pleasing shore, and plow the deep.</P>
<P>"And now the rising morn with rosy light<BR>
Adorns the skies, and puts the stars to flight;<BR>
When we from far, like bluish mists, descry<BR>
The hills, and then the plains, of Italy.<BR>
Achates first pronounc'd the joyful sound;<BR>
Then, 'Italy!' the cheerful crew rebound.<BR>
My sire Anchises crown'd a cup with wine,<BR>
And, off'ring, thus implor'd the pow'rs divine:<BR>
'Ye gods, presiding over lands and seas,<BR>
And you who raging winds and waves appease,<BR>
Breathe on our swelling sails a prosp'rous wind,<BR>
And smooth our passage to the port assign'd!'<BR>
The gentle gales their flagging force renew,<BR>
And now the happy harbor is in view.<BR>
Minerva's temple then salutes our sight,<BR>
Plac'd, as a landmark, on the mountain's height.<BR>
We furl our sails, and turn the prows to shore;<BR>
The curling waters round the galleys roar.<BR>
The land lies open to the raging east,<BR>
Then, bending like a bow, with rocks compress'd,<BR>
Shuts out the storms; the winds and waves complain,<BR>
And vent their malice on the cliffs in vain.<BR>
The port lies hid within; on either side<BR>
Two tow'ring rocks the narrow mouth divide.<BR>
The temple, which aloft we view'd before,<BR>
To distance flies, and seems to shun the shore.<BR>
Scarce landed, the first omens I beheld<BR>
Were four white steeds that cropp'd the flow'ry field.<BR>
'War, war is threaten'd from this foreign ground,'<BR>
My father cried, 'where warlike steeds are found.<BR>
Yet, since reclaim'd to chariots they submit,<BR>
And bend to stubborn yokes, and champ the bit,<BR>
Peace may succeed to war.' Our way we bend<BR>
To Pallas, and the sacred hill ascend;<BR>
There prostrate to the fierce virago pray,<BR>
Whose temple was the landmark of our way.<BR>
Each with a Phrygian mantle veil'd his head,<BR>
And all commands of Helenus obey'd,<BR>
And pious rites to Grecian Juno paid.<BR>
These dues perform'd, we stretch our sails, and stand<BR>
To sea, forsaking that suspected land.</P>
<P>"From hence Tarentum's bay appears in view,<BR>
For Hercules renown'd, if fame be true.<BR>
Just opposite, Lacinian Juno stands;<BR>
Caulonian tow'rs, and Scylacaean strands,<BR>
For shipwrecks fear'd. Mount Aetna thence we spy,<BR>
Known by the smoky flames which cloud the sky.<BR>
Far off we hear the waves with surly sound<BR>
Invade the rocks, the rocks their groans rebound.<BR>
The billows break upon the sounding strand,<BR>
And roll the rising tide, impure with sand.<BR>
Then thus Anchises, in experience old:<BR>
''T is that Charybdis which the seer foretold,<BR>
And those the promis'd rocks! Bear off to sea!'<BR>
With haste the frighted mariners obey.<BR>
First Palinurus to the larboard veer'd;<BR>
Then all the fleet by his example steer'd.<BR>
To heav'n aloft on ridgy waves we ride,<BR>
Then down to hell descend, when they divide;<BR>
And thrice our galleys knock'd the stony ground,<BR>
And thrice the hollow rocks return'd the sound,<BR>
And thrice we saw the stars, that stood with dews around.<BR>
The flagging winds forsook us, with the sun;<BR>
And, wearied, on Cyclopian shores we run.<BR>
The port capacious, and secure from wind,<BR>
Is to the foot of thund'ring Aetna join'd.<BR>
By turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high;<BR>
By turns hot embers from her entrails fly,<BR>
And flakes of mounting flames, that lick the sky.<BR>
Oft from her bowels massy rocks are thrown,<BR>
And, shiver'd by the force, come piecemeal down.<BR>
Oft liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow,<BR>
Fed from the fiery springs that boil below.<BR>
Enceladus, they say, transfix'd by Jove,<BR>
With blasted limbs came tumbling from above;<BR>
And, where he fell, th' avenging father drew<BR>
This flaming hill, and on his body threw.<BR>
As often as he turns his weary sides,<BR>
He shakes the solid isle, and smoke the heavens hides.<BR>
In shady woods we pass the tedious night,<BR>
Where bellowing sounds and groans our souls affright,<BR>
Of which no cause is offer'd to the sight;<BR>
For not one star was kindled in the sky,<BR>
Nor could the moon her borrow'd light supply;<BR>
For misty clouds involv'd the firmament,<BR>
The stars were muffled, and the moon was pent.</P>
<P>"Scarce had the rising sun the day reveal'd,<BR>
Scarce had his heat the pearly dews dispell'd,<BR>
When from the woods there bolts, before our sight,<BR>
Somewhat betwixt a mortal and a sprite,<BR>
So thin, so ghastly meager, and so wan,<BR>
So bare of flesh, he scarce resembled man.<BR>
This thing, all tatter'd, seem'd from far t' implore<BR>
Our pious aid, and pointed to the shore.<BR>
We look behind, then view his shaggy beard;<BR>
His clothes were tagg'd with thorns, and filth his limbs<BR>
besmear'd;<BR>
The rest, in mien, in habit, and in face,<BR>
Appear'd a Greek, and such indeed he was.<BR>
He cast on us, from far, a frightful view,<BR>
Whom soon for Trojans and for foes he knew;<BR>
Stood still, and paus'd; then all at once began<BR>
To stretch his limbs, and trembled as he ran.<BR>
Soon as approach'd, upon his knees he falls,<BR>
And thus with tears and sighs for pity calls:<BR>
'Now, by the pow'rs above, and what we share<BR>
From Nature's common gift, this vital air,<BR>
O Trojans, take me hence! I beg no more;<BR>
But bear me far from this unhappy shore.<BR>
'T is true, I am a Greek, and farther own,<BR>
Among your foes besieg'd th' imperial town.<BR>
For such demerits if my death be due,<BR>
No more for this abandon'd life I sue;<BR>
This only favor let my tears obtain,<BR>
To throw me headlong in the rapid main:<BR>
Since nothing more than death my crime demands,<BR>
I die content, to die by human hands.'<BR>
He said, and on his knees my knees embrac'd:<BR>
I bade him boldly tell his fortune past,<BR>
His present state, his lineage, and his name,<BR>
Th' occasion of his fears, and whence he came.<BR>
The good Anchises rais'd him with his hand;<BR>
Who, thus encourag'd, answer'd our demand:<BR>
'From Ithaca, my native soil, I came<BR>
To Troy; and Achaemenides my name.<BR>
Me my poor father with Ulysses sent;<BR>
(O had I stay'd, with poverty content!)<BR>
But, fearful for themselves, my countrymen<BR>
Left me forsaken in the Cyclops' den.<BR>
The cave, tho' large, was dark; the dismal floor<BR>
Was pav'd with mangled limbs and putrid gore.<BR>
Our monstrous host, of more than human size,<BR>
Erects his head, and stares within the skies;<BR>
Bellowing his voice, and horrid is his hue.<BR>
Ye gods, remove this plague from mortal view!<BR>
The joints of slaughter'd wretches are his food;<BR>
And for his wine he quaffs the streaming blood.<BR>
These eyes beheld, when with his spacious hand<BR>
He seiz'd two captives of our Grecian band;<BR>
Stretch'd on his back, he dash'd against the stones<BR>
Their broken bodies, and their crackling bones:<BR>
With spouting blood the purple pavement swims,<BR>
While the dire glutton grinds the trembling limbs.</P>
<P>"'Not unreveng'd Ulysses bore their fate,<BR>
Nor thoughtless of his own unhappy state;<BR>
For, gorg'd with flesh, and drunk with human wine<BR>
While fast asleep the giant lay supine,<BR>
Snoring aloud, and belching from his maw<BR>
His indigested foam, and morsels raw;<BR>
We pray; we cast the lots, and then surround<BR>
The monstrous body, stretch'd along the ground:<BR>
Each, as he could approach him, lends a hand<BR>
To bore his eyeball with a flaming brand.<BR>
Beneath his frowning forehead lay his eye;<BR>
For only one did the vast frame supply-<BR>
But that a globe so large, his front it fill'd,<BR>
Like the sun's disk or like a Grecian shield.<BR>
The stroke succeeds; and down the pupil bends:<BR>
This vengeance follow'd for our slaughter'd friends.<BR>
But haste, unhappy wretches, haste to fly!<BR>
Your cables cut, and on your oars rely!<BR>
Such, and so vast as Polypheme appears,<BR>
A hundred more this hated island bears:<BR>
Like him, in caves they shut their woolly sheep;<BR>
Like him, their herds on tops of mountains keep;<BR>
Like him, with mighty strides, they stalk from steep to steep<BR>
And now three moons their sharpen'd horns renew,<BR>
Since thus, in woods and wilds, obscure from view,<BR>
I drag my loathsome days with mortal fright,<BR>
And in deserted caverns lodge by night;<BR>
Oft from the rocks a dreadful prospect see<BR>
Of the huge Cyclops, like a walking tree:<BR>
From far I hear his thund'ring voice resound,<BR>
And trampling feet that shake the solid ground.<BR>
Cornels and salvage berries of the wood,<BR>
And roots and herbs, have been my meager food.<BR>
While all around my longing eyes I cast,<BR>
I saw your happy ships appear at last.<BR>
On those I fix'd my hopes, to these I run;<BR>
'T is all I ask, this cruel race to shun;<BR>
What other death you please, yourselves bestow.'</P>
<P>"Scarce had he said, when on the mountain's brow<BR>
We saw the giant shepherd stalk before<BR>
His following flock, and leading to the shore:<BR>
A monstrous bulk, deform'd, depriv'd of sight;<BR>
His staff a trunk of pine, to guide his steps aright.<BR>
His pond'rous whistle from his neck descends;<BR>
His woolly care their pensive lord attends:<BR>
This only solace his hard fortune sends.<BR>
Soon as he reach'd the shore and touch'd the waves,<BR>
From his bor'd eye the gutt'ring blood he laves:<BR>
He gnash'd his teeth, and groan'd; thro' seas he strides,<BR>
And scarce the topmost billows touch'd his sides.</P>
<P>"Seiz'd with a sudden fear, we run to sea,<BR>
The cables cut, and silent haste away;<BR>
The well-deserving stranger entertain;<BR>
Then, buckling to the work, our oars divide the main.<BR>
The giant harken'd to the dashing sound:<BR>
But, when our vessels out of reach he found,<BR>
He strided onward, and in vain essay'd<BR>
Th' Ionian deep, and durst no farther wade.<BR>
With that he roar'd aloud: the dreadful cry<BR>
Shakes earth, and air, and seas; the billows fly<BR>
Before the bellowing noise to distant Italy.<BR>
The neigh'ring Aetna trembling all around,<BR>
The winding caverns echo to the sound.<BR>
His brother Cyclops hear the yelling roar,<BR>
And, rushing down the mountains, crowd the shore.<BR>
We saw their stern distorted looks, from far,<BR>
And one-eyed glance, that vainly threaten'd war:<BR>
A dreadful council, with their heads on high;<BR>
(The misty clouds about their foreheads fly;)<BR>
Not yielding to the tow'ring tree of Jove,<BR>
Or tallest cypress of Diana's grove.<BR>
New pangs of mortal fear our minds assail;<BR>
We tug at ev'ry oar, and hoist up ev'ry sail,<BR>
And take th' advantage of the friendly gale.<BR>
Forewarn'd by Helenus, we strive to shun<BR>
Charybdis' gulf, nor dare to Scylla run.<BR>
An equal fate on either side appears:<BR>
We, tacking to the left, are free from fears;<BR>
For, from Pelorus' point, the North arose,<BR>
And drove us back where swift Pantagias flows.<BR>
His rocky mouth we pass, and make our way<BR>
By Thapsus and Megara's winding bay.<BR>
This passage Achaemenides had shown,<BR>
Tracing the course which he before had run.</P>
<P>"Right o'er against Plemmyrium's wat'ry strand,<BR>
There lies an isle once call'd th' Ortygian land.<BR>
Alpheus, as old fame reports, has found<BR>
From Greece a secret passage under ground,<BR>
By love to beauteous Arethusa led;<BR>
And, mingling here, they roll in the same sacred bed.<BR>
As Helenus enjoin'd, we next adore<BR>
Diana's name, protectress of the shore.<BR>
With prosp'rous gales we pass the quiet sounds<BR>
Of still Elorus, and his fruitful bounds.<BR>
Then, doubling Cape Pachynus, we survey<BR>
The rocky shore extended to the sea.<BR>
The town of Camarine from far we see,<BR>
And fenny lake, undrain'd by fate's decree.<BR>
In sight of the Geloan fields we pass,<BR>
And the large walls, where mighty Gela was;<BR>
Then Agragas, with lofty summits crown'd,<BR>
Long for the race of warlike steeds renown'd.<BR>
We pass'd Selinus, and the palmy land,<BR>
And widely shun the Lilybaean strand,<BR>
Unsafe, for secret rocks and moving sand.<BR>
At length on shore the weary fleet arriv'd,<BR>
Which Drepanum's unhappy port receiv'd.<BR>
Here, after endless labors, often toss'd<BR>
By raging storms, and driv'n on ev'ry coast,<BR>
My dear, dear father, spent with age, I lost:<BR>
Ease of my cares, and solace of my pain,<BR>
Sav'd thro' a thousand toils, but sav'd in vain<BR>
The prophet, who my future woes reveal'd,<BR>
Yet this, the greatest and the worst, conceal'd;<BR>
And dire Celaeno, whose foreboding skill<BR>
Denounc'd all else, was silent of the ill.<BR>
This my last labor was. Some friendly god<BR>
From thence convey'd us to your blest abode."</P>
<P>Thus, to the list'ning queen, the royal guest<BR>
His wand'ring course and all his toils express'd;<BR>
And here concluding, he retir'd to rest.</P>
