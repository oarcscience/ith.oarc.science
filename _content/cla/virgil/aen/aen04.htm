<P>But anxious cares already seiz'd the queen:<BR>
She fed within her veins a flame unseen;<BR>
The hero's valor, acts, and birth inspire<BR>
Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire.<BR>
His words, his looks, imprinted in her heart,<BR>
Improve the passion, and increase the smart.<BR>
Now, when the purple morn had chas'd away<BR>
The dewy shadows, and restor'd the day,<BR>
Her sister first with early care she sought,<BR>
And thus in mournful accents eas'd her thought:</P>
<P>"My dearest Anna, what new dreams affright<BR>
My lab'ring soul! what visions of the night<BR>
Disturb my quiet, and distract my breast<BR>
With strange ideas of our Trojan guest!<BR>
His worth, his actions, and majestic air,<BR>
A man descended from the gods declare.<BR>
Fear ever argues a degenerate kind;<BR>
His birth is well asserted by his mind.<BR>
Then, what he suffer'd, when by Fate betray'd!<BR>
What brave attempts for falling Troy he made!<BR>
Such were his looks, so gracefully he spoke,<BR>
That, were I not resolv'd against the yoke<BR>
Of hapless marriage, never to be curst<BR>
With second love, so fatal was my first,<BR>
To this one error I might yield again;<BR>
For, since Sichaeus was untimely slain,<BR>
This only man is able to subvert<BR>
The fix'd foundations of my stubborn heart.<BR>
And, to confess my frailty, to my shame,<BR>
Somewhat I find within, if not the same,<BR>
Too like the sparkles of my former flame.<BR>
But first let yawning earth a passage rend,<BR>
And let me thro' the dark abyss descend;<BR>
First let avenging Jove, with flames from high,<BR>
Drive down this body to the nether sky,<BR>
Condemn'd with ghosts in endless night to lie,<BR>
Before I break the plighted faith I gave!<BR>
No! he who had my vows shall ever have;<BR>
For, whom I lov'd on earth, I worship in the grave."</P>
<P>She said: the tears ran gushing from her eyes,<BR>
And stopp'd her speech. Her sister thus replies:<BR>
"O dearer than the vital air I breathe,<BR>
Will you to grief your blooming years bequeath,<BR>
Condemn'd to waste in woes your lonely life,<BR>
Without the joys of mother or of wife?<BR>
Think you these tears, this pompous train of woe,<BR>
Are known or valued by the ghosts below?<BR>
I grant that, while your sorrows yet were green,<BR>
It well became a woman, and a queen,<BR>
The vows of Tyrian princes to neglect,<BR>
To scorn Hyarbas, and his love reject,<BR>
With all the Libyan lords of mighty name;<BR>
But will you fight against a pleasing flame!<BR>
This little spot of land, which Heav'n bestows,<BR>
On ev'ry side is hemm'd with warlike foes;<BR>
Gaetulian cities here are spread around,<BR>
And fierce Numidians there your frontiers bound;<BR>
Here lies a barren waste of thirsty land,<BR>
And there the Syrtes raise the moving sand;<BR>
Barcaean troops besiege the narrow shore,<BR>
And from the sea Pygmalion threatens more.<BR>
Propitious Heav'n, and gracious Juno, lead<BR>
This wand'ring navy to your needful aid:<BR>
How will your empire spread, your city rise,<BR>
From such a union, and with such allies?<BR>
Implore the favor of the pow'rs above,<BR>
And leave the conduct of the rest to love.<BR>
Continue still your hospitable way,<BR>
And still invent occasions of their stay,<BR>
Till storms and winter winds shall cease to threat,<BR>
And planks and oars repair their shatter'd fleet."</P>
<P>These words, which from a friend and sister came,<BR>
With ease resolv'd the scruples of her fame,<BR>
And added fury to the kindled flame.<BR>
Inspir'd with hope, the project they pursue;<BR>
On ev'ry altar sacrifice renew:<BR>
A chosen ewe of two years old they pay<BR>
To Ceres, Bacchus, and the God of Day;<BR>
Preferring Juno's pow'r, for Juno ties<BR>
The nuptial knot and makes the marriage joys.<BR>
The beauteous queen before her altar stands,<BR>
And holds the golden goblet in her hands.<BR>
A milk-white heifer she with flow'rs adorns,<BR>
And pours the ruddy wine betwixt her horns;<BR>
And, while the priests with pray'r the gods invoke,<BR>
She feeds their altars with Sabaean smoke,<BR>
With hourly care the sacrifice renews,<BR>
And anxiously the panting entrails views.<BR>
What priestly rites, alas! what pious art,<BR>
What vows avail to cure a bleeding heart!<BR>
A gentle fire she feeds within her veins,<BR>
Where the soft god secure in silence reigns.</P>
<P>Sick with desire, and seeking him she loves,<BR>
From street to street the raving Dido roves.<BR>
So when the watchful shepherd, from the blind,<BR>
Wounds with a random shaft the careless hind,<BR>
Distracted with her pain she flies the woods,<BR>
Bounds o'er the lawn, and seeks the silent floods,<BR>
With fruitless care; for still the fatal dart<BR>
Sticks in her side, and rankles in her heart.<BR>
And now she leads the Trojan chief along<BR>
The lofty walls, amidst the busy throng;<BR>
Displays her Tyrian wealth, and rising town,<BR>
Which love, without his labor, makes his own.<BR>
This pomp she shows, to tempt her wand'ring guest;<BR>
Her falt'ring tongue forbids to speak the rest.<BR>
When day declines, and feasts renew the night,<BR>
Still on his face she feeds her famish'd sight;<BR>
She longs again to hear the prince relate<BR>
His own adventures and the Trojan fate.<BR>
He tells it o'er and o'er; but still in vain,<BR>
For still she begs to hear it once again.<BR>
The hearer on the speaker's mouth depends,<BR>
And thus the tragic story never ends.</P>
<P>Then, when they part, when Phoebe's paler light<BR>
Withdraws, and falling stars to sleep invite,<BR>
She last remains, when ev'ry guest is gone,<BR>
Sits on the bed he press'd, and sighs alone;<BR>
Absent, her absent hero sees and hears;<BR>
Or in her bosom young Ascanius bears,<BR>
And seeks the father's image in the child,<BR>
If love by likeness might be so beguil'd.</P>
<P>Meantime the rising tow'rs are at a stand;<BR>
No labors exercise the youthful band,<BR>
Nor use of arts, nor toils of arms they know;<BR>
The mole is left unfinish'd to the foe;<BR>
The mounds, the works, the walls, neglected lie,<BR>
Short of their promis'd heighth, that seem'd to threat the sky,</P>
<P>But when imperial Juno, from above,<BR>
Saw Dido fetter'd in the chains of love,<BR>
Hot with the venom which her veins inflam'd,<BR>
And by no sense of shame to be reclaim'd,<BR>
With soothing words to Venus she begun:<BR>
"High praises, endless honors, you have won,<BR>
And mighty trophies, with your worthy son!<BR>
Two gods a silly woman have undone!<BR>
Nor am I ignorant, you both suspect<BR>
This rising city, which my hands erect:<BR>
But shall celestial discord never cease?<BR>
'T is better ended in a lasting peace.<BR>
You stand possess'd of all your soul desir'd:<BR>
Poor Dido with consuming love is fir'd.<BR>
Your Trojan with my Tyrian let us join;<BR>
So Dido shall be yours, Aeneas mine:<BR>
One common kingdom, one united line.<BR>
Eliza shall a Dardan lord obey,<BR>
And lofty Carthage for a dow'r convey."<BR>
Then Venus, who her hidden fraud descried,<BR>
Which would the scepter of the world misguide<BR>
To Libyan shores, thus artfully replied:<BR>
"Who, but a fool, would wars with Juno choose,<BR>
And such alliance and such gifts refuse,<BR>
If Fortune with our joint desires comply?<BR>
The doubt is all from Jove and destiny;<BR>
Lest he forbid, with absolute command,<BR>
To mix the people in one common land-<BR>
Or will the Trojan and the Tyrian line<BR>
In lasting leagues and sure succession join?<BR>
But you, the partner of his bed and throne,<BR>
May move his mind; my wishes are your own."</P>
<P>"Mine," said imperial Juno, "be the care;<BR>
Time urges, now, to perfect this affair:<BR>
Attend my counsel, and the secret share.<BR>
When next the Sun his rising light displays,<BR>
And gilds the world below with purple rays,<BR>
The queen, Aeneas, and the Tyrian court<BR>
Shall to the shady woods, for sylvan game, resort.<BR>
There, while the huntsmen pitch their toils around,<BR>
And cheerful horns from side to side resound,<BR>
A pitchy cloud shall cover all the plain<BR>
With hail, and thunder, and tempestuous rain;<BR>
The fearful train shall take their speedy flight,<BR>
Dispers'd, and all involv'd in gloomy night;<BR>
One cave a grateful shelter shall afford<BR>
To the fair princess and the Trojan lord.<BR>
I will myself the bridal bed prepare,<BR>
If you, to bless the nuptials, will be there:<BR>
So shall their loves be crown'd with due delights,<BR>
And Hymen shall be present at the rites."<BR>
The Queen of Love consents, and closely smiles<BR>
At her vain project, and discover'd wiles.</P>
<P>The rosy morn was risen from the main,<BR>
And horns and hounds awake the princely train:<BR>
They issue early thro' the city gate,<BR>
Where the more wakeful huntsmen ready wait,<BR>
With nets, and toils, and darts, beside the force<BR>
Of Spartan dogs, and swift Massylian horse.<BR>
The Tyrian peers and officers of state<BR>
For the slow queen in antechambers wait;<BR>
Her lofty courser, in the court below,<BR>
Who his majestic rider seems to know,<BR>
Proud of his purple trappings, paws the ground,<BR>
And champs the golden bit, and spreads the foam around.<BR>
The queen at length appears; on either hand<BR>
The brawny guards in martial order stand.<BR>
A flow'r'd simar with golden fringe she wore,<BR>
And at her back a golden quiver bore;<BR>
Her flowing hair a golden caul restrains,<BR>
A golden clasp the Tyrian robe sustains.<BR>
Then young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace,<BR>
Leads on the Trojan youth to view the chase.<BR>
But far above the rest in beauty shines<BR>
The great Aeneas, the troop he joins;<BR>
Like fair Apollo, when he leaves the frost<BR>
Of wint'ry Xanthus, and the Lycian coast,<BR>
When to his native Delos he resorts,<BR>
Ordains the dances, and renews the sports;<BR>
Where painted Scythians, mix'd with Cretan bands,<BR>
Before the joyful altars join their hands:<BR>
Himself, on Cynthus walking, sees below<BR>
The merry madness of the sacred show.<BR>
Green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose;<BR>
A golden fillet binds his awful brows;<BR>
His quiver sounds: not less the prince is seen<BR>
In manly presence, or in lofty mien.</P>
<P>Now had they reach'd the hills, and storm'd the seat<BR>
Of salvage beasts, in dens, their last retreat.<BR>
The cry pursues the mountain goats: they bound<BR>
From rock to rock, and keep the craggy ground;<BR>
Quite otherwise the stags, a trembling train,<BR>
In herds unsingled, scour the dusty plain,<BR>
And a long chase in open view maintain.<BR>
The glad Ascanius, as his courser guides,<BR>
Spurs thro' the vale, and these and those outrides.<BR>
His horse's flanks and sides are forc'd to feel<BR>
The clanking lash, and goring of the steel.<BR>
Impatiently he views the feeble prey,<BR>
Wishing some nobler beast to cross his way,<BR>
And rather would the tusky boar attend,<BR>
Or see the tawny lion downward bend.</P>
<P>Meantime, the gath'ring clouds obscure the skies:<BR>
From pole to pole the forky lightning flies;<BR>
The rattling thunders roll; and Juno pours<BR>
A wintry deluge down, and sounding show'rs.<BR>
The company, dispers'd, to converts ride,<BR>
And seek the homely cots, or mountain's hollow side.<BR>
The rapid rains, descending from the hills,<BR>
To rolling torrents raise the creeping rills.<BR>
The queen and prince, as love or fortune guides,<BR>
One common cavern in her bosom hides.<BR>
Then first the trembling earth the signal gave,<BR>
And flashing fires enlighten all the cave;<BR>
Hell from below, and Juno from above,<BR>
And howling nymphs, were conscious of their love.<BR>
From this ill-omen'd hour in time arose<BR>
Debate and death, and all succeeding woes.</P>
<P>The queen, whom sense of honor could not move,<BR>
No longer made a secret of her love,<BR>
But call'd it marriage, by that specious name<BR>
To veil the crime and sanctify the shame.</P>
<P>The loud report thro' Libyan cities goes.<BR>
Fame, the great ill, from small beginnings grows:<BR>
Swift from the first; and ev'ry moment brings<BR>
New vigor to her flights, new pinions to her wings.<BR>
Soon grows the pigmy to gigantic size;<BR>
Her feet on earth, her forehead in the skies.<BR>
Inrag'd against the gods, revengeful Earth<BR>
Produc'd her last of the Titanian birth.<BR>
Swift is her walk, more swift her winged haste:<BR>
A monstrous phantom, horrible and vast.<BR>
As many plumes as raise her lofty flight,<BR>
So many piercing eyes inlarge her sight;<BR>
Millions of opening mouths to Fame belong,<BR>
And ev'ry mouth is furnish'd with a tongue,<BR>
And round with list'ning ears the flying plague is hung.<BR>
She fills the peaceful universe with cries;<BR>
No slumbers ever close her wakeful eyes;<BR>
By day, from lofty tow'rs her head she shews,<BR>
And spreads thro' trembling crowds disastrous news;<BR>
With court informers haunts, and royal spies;<BR>
Things done relates, not done she feigns, and mingles truth with</P>
<P>lies.<BR>
Talk is her business, and her chief delight<BR>
To tell of prodigies and cause affright.<BR>
She fills the people's ears with Dido's name,<BR>
Who, lost to honor and the sense of shame,<BR>
Admits into her throne and nuptial bed<BR>
A wand'ring guest, who from his country fled:<BR>
Whole days with him she passes in delights,<BR>
And wastes in luxury long winter nights,<BR>
Forgetful of her fame and royal trust,<BR>
Dissolv'd in ease, abandon'd to her lust.</P>
<P>The goddess widely spreads the loud report,<BR>
And flies at length to King Hyarba's court.<BR>
When first possess'd with this unwelcome news<BR>
Whom did he not of men and gods accuse?<BR>
This prince, from ravish'd Garamantis born,<BR>
A hundred temples did with spoils adorn,<BR>
In Ammon's honor, his celestial sire;<BR>
A hundred altars fed with wakeful fire;<BR>
And, thro' his vast dominions, priests ordain'd,<BR>
Whose watchful care these holy rites maintain'd.<BR>
The gates and columns were with garlands crown'd,<BR>
And blood of victim beasts enrich'd the ground.</P>
<P>He, when he heard a fugitive could move<BR>
The Tyrian princess, who disdain'd his love,<BR>
His breast with fury burn'd, his eyes with fire,<BR>
Mad with despair, impatient with desire;<BR>
Then on the sacred altars pouring wine,<BR>
He thus with pray'rs implor'd his sire divine:<BR>
"Great Jove! propitious to the Moorish race,<BR>
Who feast on painted beds, with off'rings grace<BR>
Thy temples, and adore thy pow'r divine<BR>
With blood of victims, and with sparkling wine,<BR>
Seest thou not this? or do we fear in vain<BR>
Thy boasted thunder, and thy thoughtless reign?<BR>
Do thy broad hands the forky lightnings lance?<BR>
Thine are the bolts, or the blind work of chance?<BR>
A wand'ring woman builds, within our state,<BR>
A little town, bought at an easy rate;<BR>
She pays me homage, and my grants allow<BR>
A narrow space of Libyan lands to plow;<BR>
Yet, scorning me, by passion blindly led,<BR>
Admits a banish'd Trojan to her bed!<BR>
And now this other Paris, with his train<BR>
Of conquer'd cowards, must in Afric reign!<BR>
(Whom, what they are, their looks and garb confess,<BR>
Their locks with oil perfum'd, their Lydian dress.)<BR>
He takes the spoil, enjoys the princely dame;<BR>
And I, rejected I, adore an empty name."</P>
<P>His vows, in haughty terms, he thus preferr'd,<BR>
And held his altar's horns. The mighty Thund'rer heard;<BR>
Then cast his eyes on Carthage, where he found<BR>
The lustful pair in lawless pleasure drown'd,<BR>
Lost in their loves, insensible of shame,<BR>
And both forgetful of their better fame.<BR>
He calls Cyllenius, and the god attends,<BR>
By whom his menacing command he sends:<BR>
"Go, mount the western winds, and cleave the sky;<BR>
Then, with a swift descent, to Carthage fly:<BR>
There find the Trojan chief, who wastes his days<BR>
In slothful not and inglorious ease,<BR>
Nor minds the future city, giv'n by fate.<BR>
To him this message from my mouth relate:<BR>
'Not so fair Venus hop'd, when twice she won<BR>
Thy life with pray'rs, nor promis'd such a son.<BR>
Hers was a hero, destin'd to command<BR>
A martial race, and rule the Latian land,<BR>
Who should his ancient line from Teucer draw,<BR>
And on the conquer'd world impose the law.'<BR>
If glory cannot move a mind so mean,<BR>
Nor future praise from fading pleasure wean,<BR>
Yet why should he defraud his son of fame,<BR>
And grudge the Romans their immortal name!<BR>
What are his vain designs! what hopes he more<BR>
From his long ling'ring on a hostile shore,<BR>
Regardless to redeem his honor lost,<BR>
And for his race to gain th' Ausonian coast!<BR>
Bid him with speed the Tyrian court forsake;<BR>
With this command the slumb'ring warrior wake."</P>
<P>Hermes obeys; with golden pinions binds<BR>
His flying feet, and mounts the western winds:<BR>
And, whether o'er the seas or earth he flies,<BR>
With rapid force they bear him down the skies.<BR>
But first he grasps within his awful hand<BR>
The mark of sov'reign pow'r, his magic wand;<BR>
With this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves;<BR>
With this he drives them down the Stygian waves;<BR>
With this he seals in sleep the wakeful sight,<BR>
And eyes, tho' clos'd in death, restores to light.<BR>
Thus arm'd, the god begins his airy race,<BR>
And drives the racking clouds along the liquid space;<BR>
Now sees the tops of Atlas, as he flies,<BR>
Whose brawny back supports the starry skies;<BR>
Atlas, whose head, with piny forests crown'd,<BR>
Is beaten by the winds, with foggy vapors bound.<BR>
Snows hide his shoulders; from beneath his chin<BR>
The founts of rolling streams their race begin;<BR>
A beard of ice on his large breast depends.<BR>
Here, pois'd upon his wings, the god descends:<BR>
Then, rested thus, he from the tow'ring height<BR>
Plung'd downward, with precipitated flight,<BR>
Lights on the seas, and skims along the flood.<BR>
As waterfowl, who seek their fishy food,<BR>
Less, and yet less, to distant prospect show;<BR>
By turns they dance aloft, and dive below:<BR>
Like these, the steerage of his wings he plies,<BR>
And near the surface of the water flies,<BR>
Till, having pass'd the seas, and cross'd the sands,<BR>
He clos'd his wings, and stoop'd on Libyan lands:<BR>
Where shepherds once were hous'd in homely sheds,<BR>
Now tow'rs within the clouds advance their heads.<BR>
Arriving there, he found the Trojan prince<BR>
New ramparts raising for the town's defense.<BR>
A purple scarf, with gold embroider'd o'er,<BR>
(Queen Dido's gift,) about his waist he wore;<BR>
A sword, with glitt'ring gems diversified,<BR>
For ornament, not use, hung idly by his side.</P>
<P>Then thus, with winged words, the god began,<BR>
Resuming his own shape: "Degenerate man,<BR>
Thou woman's property, what mak'st thou here,<BR>
These foreign walls and Tyrian tow'rs to rear,<BR>
Forgetful of thy own? All-pow'rful Jove,<BR>
Who sways the world below and heav'n above,<BR>
Has sent me down with this severe command:<BR>
What means thy ling'ring in the Libyan land?<BR>
If glory cannot move a mind so mean,<BR>
Nor future praise from flitting pleasure wean,<BR>
Regard the fortunes of thy rising heir:<BR>
The promis'd crown let young Ascanius wear,<BR>
To whom th' Ausonian scepter, and the state<BR>
Of Rome's imperial name is ow'd by fate."<BR>
So spoke the god; and, speaking, took his flight,<BR>
Involv'd in clouds, and vanish'd out of sight.</P>
<P>The pious prince was seiz'd with sudden fear;<BR>
Mute was his tongue, and upright stood his hair.<BR>
Revolving in his mind the stern command,<BR>
He longs to fly, and loathes the charming land.<BR>
What should he say? or how should he begin?<BR>
What course, alas! remains to steer between<BR>
Th' offended lover and the pow'rful queen?<BR>
This way and that he turns his anxious mind,<BR>
And all expedients tries, and none can find.<BR>
Fix'd on the deed, but doubtful of the means,<BR>
After long thought, to this advice he leans:<BR>
Three chiefs he calls, commands them to repair<BR>
The fleet, and ship their men with silent care;<BR>
Some plausible pretense he bids them find,<BR>
To color what in secret he design'd.<BR>
Himself, meantime, the softest hours would choose,<BR>
Before the love-sick lady heard the news;<BR>
And move her tender mind, by slow degrees,<BR>
To suffer what the sov'reign pow'r decrees:<BR>
Jove will inspire him, when, and what to say.<BR>
They hear with pleasure, and with haste obey.</P>
<P>But soon the queen perceives the thin disguise:<BR>
(What arts can blind a jealous woman's eyes!)<BR>
She was the first to find the secret fraud,<BR>
Before the fatal news was blaz'd abroad.<BR>
Love the first motions of the lover hears,<BR>
Quick to presage, and ev'n in safety fears.<BR>
Nor impious Fame was wanting to report<BR>
The ships repair'd, the Trojans' thick resort,<BR>
And purpose to forsake the Tyrian court.<BR>
Frantic with fear, impatient of the wound,<BR>
And impotent of mind, she roves the city round.<BR>
Less wild the Bacchanalian dames appear,<BR>
When, from afar, their nightly god they hear,<BR>
And howl about the hills, and shake the wreathy spear.<BR>
At length she finds the dear perfidious man;<BR>
Prevents his form'd excuse, and thus began:<BR>
"Base and ungrateful! could you hope to fly,<BR>
And undiscover'd scape a lover's eye?<BR>
Nor could my kindness your compassion move.<BR>
Nor plighted vows, nor dearer bands of love?<BR>
Or is the death of a despairing queen<BR>
Not worth preventing, tho' too well foreseen?<BR>
Ev'n when the wintry winds command your stay,<BR>
You dare the tempests, and defy the sea.<BR>
False as you are, suppose you were not bound<BR>
To lands unknown, and foreign coasts to sound;<BR>
Were Troy restor'd, and Priam's happy reign,<BR>
Now durst you tempt, for Troy, the raging main?<BR>
See whom you fly! am I the foe you shun?<BR>
Now, by those holy vows, so late begun,<BR>
By this right hand, (since I have nothing more<BR>
To challenge, but the faith you gave before;)<BR>
I beg you by these tears too truly shed,<BR>
By the new pleasures of our nuptial bed;<BR>
If ever Dido, when you most were kind,<BR>
Were pleasing in your eyes, or touch'd your mind;<BR>
By these my pray'rs, if pray'rs may yet have place,<BR>
Pity the fortunes of a falling race.<BR>
For you I have provok'd a tyrant's hate,<BR>
Incens'd the Libyan and the Tyrian state;<BR>
For you alone I suffer in my fame,<BR>
Bereft of honor, and expos'd to shame.<BR>
Whom have I now to trust, ungrateful guest?<BR>
(That only name remains of all the rest!)<BR>
What have I left? or whither can I fly?<BR>
Must I attend Pygmalion's cruelty,<BR>
Or till Hyarba shall in triumph lead<BR>
A queen that proudly scorn'd his proffer'd bed?<BR>
Had you deferr'd, at least, your hasty flight,<BR>
And left behind some pledge of our delight,<BR>
Some babe to bless the mother's mournful sight,<BR>
Some young Aeneas, to supply your place,<BR>
Whose features might express his father's face;<BR>
I should not then complain to live bereft<BR>
Of all my husband, or be wholly left."</P>
<P>Here paus'd the queen. Unmov'd he holds his eyes,<BR>
By Jove's command; nor suffer'd love to rise,<BR>
Tho' heaving in his heart; and thus at length replies:<BR>
"Fair queen, you never can enough repeat<BR>
Your boundless favors, or I own my debt;<BR>
Nor can my mind forget Eliza's name,<BR>
While vital breath inspires this mortal frame.<BR>
This only let me speak in my defense:<BR>
I never hop'd a secret flight from hence,<BR>
Much less pretended to the lawful claim<BR>
Of sacred nuptials, or a husband's name.<BR>
For, if indulgent Heav'n would leave me free,<BR>
And not submit my life to fate's decree,<BR>
My choice would lead me to the Trojan shore,<BR>
Those relics to review, their dust adore,<BR>
And Priam's ruin'd palace to restore.<BR>
But now the Delphian oracle commands,<BR>
And fate invites me to the Latian lands.<BR>
That is the promis'd place to which I steer,<BR>
And all my vows are terminated there.<BR>
If you, a Tyrian, and a stranger born,<BR>
With walls and tow'rs a Libyan town adorn,<BR>
Why may not we- like you, a foreign race-<BR>
Like you, seek shelter in a foreign place?<BR>
As often as the night obscures the skies<BR>
With humid shades, or twinkling stars arise,<BR>
Anchises' angry ghost in dreams appears,<BR>
Chides my delay, and fills my soul with fears;<BR>
And young Ascanius justly may complain<BR>
Of his defrauded and destin'd reign.<BR>
Ev'n now the herald of the gods appear'd:<BR>
Waking I saw him, and his message heard.<BR>
From Jove he came commission'd, heav'nly bright<BR>
With radiant beams, and manifest to sight<BR>
(The sender and the sent I both attest)<BR>
These walls he enter'd, and those words express'd.<BR>
Fair queen, oppose not what the gods command;<BR>
Forc'd by my fate, I leave your happy land."</P>
<P>Thus while he spoke, already she began,<BR>
With sparkling eyes, to view the guilty man;<BR>
From head to foot survey'd his person o'er,<BR>
Nor longer these outrageous threats forebore:<BR>
"False as thou art, and, more than false, forsworn!<BR>
Not sprung from noble blood, nor goddess-born,<BR>
But hewn from harden'd entrails of a rock!<BR>
And rough Hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck!<BR>
Why should I fawn? what have I worse to fear?<BR>
Did he once look, or lent a list'ning ear,<BR>
Sigh'd when I sobb'd, or shed one kindly tear?-<BR>
All symptoms of a base ungrateful mind,<BR>
So foul, that, which is worse, 'tis hard to find.<BR>
Of man's injustice why should I complain?<BR>
The gods, and Jove himself, behold in vain<BR>
Triumphant treason; yet no thunder flies,<BR>
Nor Juno views my wrongs with equal eyes;<BR>
Faithless is earth, and faithless are the skies!<BR>
Justice is fled, and Truth is now no more!<BR>
I sav'd the shipwrack'd exile on my shore;<BR>
With needful food his hungry Trojans fed;<BR>
I took the traitor to my throne and bed:<BR>
Fool that I was- 't is little to repeat<BR>
The rest- I stor'd and rigg'd his ruin'd fleet.<BR>
I rave, I rave! A god's command he pleads,<BR>
And makes Heav'n accessary to his deeds.<BR>
Now Lycian lots, and now the Delian god,<BR>
Now Hermes is employ'd from Jove's abode,<BR>
To warn him hence; as if the peaceful state<BR>
Of heav'nly pow'rs were touch'd with human fate!<BR>
But go! thy flight no longer I detain-<BR>
Go seek thy promis'd kingdom thro' the main!<BR>
Yet, if the heav'ns will hear my pious vow,<BR>
The faithless waves, not half so false as thou,<BR>
Or secret sands, shall sepulchers afford<BR>
To thy proud vessels, and their perjur'd lord.<BR>
Then shalt thou call on injur'd Dido's name:<BR>
Dido shall come in a black sulph'ry flame,<BR>
When death has once dissolv'd her mortal frame;<BR>
Shall smile to see the traitor vainly weep:<BR>
Her angry ghost, arising from the deep,<BR>
Shall haunt thee waking, and disturb thy sleep.<BR>
At least my shade thy punishment shall know,<BR>
And Fame shall spread the pleasing news below."</P>
<P>Abruptly here she stops; then turns away<BR>
Her loathing eyes, and shuns the sight of day.<BR>
Amaz'd he stood, revolving in his mind<BR>
What speech to frame, and what excuse to find.<BR>
Her fearful maids their fainting mistress led,<BR>
And softly laid her on her ivory bed.</P>
<P>But good Aeneas, tho' he much desir'd<BR>
To give that pity which her grief requir'd;<BR>
Tho' much he mourn'd, and labor'd with his love,<BR>
Resolv'd at length, obeys the will of Jove;<BR>
Reviews his forces: they with early care<BR>
Unmoor their vessels, and for sea prepare.<BR>
The fleet is soon afloat, in all its pride,<BR>
And well-calk'd galleys in the harbor ride.<BR>
Then oaks for oars they fell'd; or, as they stood,<BR>
Of its green arms despoil'd the growing wood,<BR>
Studious of flight. The beach is cover'd o'er<BR>
With Trojan bands, that blacken all the shore:<BR>
On ev'ry side are seen, descending down,<BR>
Thick swarms of soldiers, loaden from the town.<BR>
Thus, in battalia, march embodied ants,<BR>
Fearful of winter, and of future wants,<BR>
T' invade the corn, and to their cells convey<BR>
The plunder'd forage of their yellow prey.<BR>
The sable troops, along the narrow tracks,<BR>
Scarce bear the weighty burthen on their backs:<BR>
Some set their shoulders to the pond'rous grain;<BR>
Some guard the spoil; some lash the lagging train;<BR>
All ply their sev'ral tasks, and equal toil sustain.</P>
<P>What pangs the tender breast of Dido tore,<BR>
When, from the tow'r, she saw the cover'd shore,<BR>
And heard the shouts of sailors from afar,<BR>
Mix'd with the murmurs of the wat'ry war!<BR>
All-pow'rful Love! what changes canst thou cause<BR>
In human hearts, subjected to thy laws!<BR>
Once more her haughty soul the tyrant bends:<BR>
To pray'rs and mean submissions she descends.<BR>
No female arts or aids she left untried,<BR>
Nor counsels unexplor'd, before she died.<BR>
"Look, Anna! look! the Trojans crowd to sea;<BR>
They spread their canvas, and their anchors weigh.<BR>
The shouting crew their ships with garlands bind,<BR>
Invoke the sea gods, and invite the wind.<BR>
Could I have thought this threat'ning blow so near,<BR>
My tender soul had been forewarn'd to bear.<BR>
But do not you my last request deny;<BR>
With yon perfidious man your int'rest try,<BR>
And bring me news, if I must live or die.<BR>
You are his fav'rite; you alone can find<BR>
The dark recesses of his inmost mind:<BR>
In all his trusted secrets you have part,<BR>
And know the soft approaches to his heart.<BR>
Haste then, and humbly seek my haughty foe;<BR>
Tell him, I did not with the Grecians go,<BR>
Nor did my fleet against his friends employ,<BR>
Nor swore the ruin of unhappy Troy,<BR>
Nor mov'd with hands profane his father's dust:<BR>
Why should he then reject a just!<BR>
Whom does he shun, and whither would he fly!<BR>
Can he this last, this only pray'r deny!<BR>
Let him at least his dang'rous flight delay,<BR>
Wait better winds, and hope a calmer sea.<BR>
The nuptials he disclaims I urge no more:<BR>
Let him pursue the promis'd Latian shore.<BR>
A short delay is all I ask him now;<BR>
A pause of grief, an interval from woe,<BR>
Till my soft soul be temper'd to sustain<BR>
Accustom'd sorrows, and inur'd to pain.<BR>
If you in pity grant this one request,<BR>
My death shall glut the hatred of his breast."<BR>
This mournful message pious Anna bears,<BR>
And seconds with her own her sister's tears:<BR>
But all her arts are still employ'd in vain;<BR>
Again she comes, and is refus'd again.<BR>
His harden'd heart nor pray'rs nor threat'nings move;<BR>
Fate, and the god, had stopp'd his ears to love.</P>
<P>As, when the winds their airy quarrel try,<BR>
Justling from ev'ry quarter of the sky,<BR>
This way and that the mountain oak they bend,<BR>
His boughs they shatter, and his branches rend;<BR>
With leaves and falling mast they spread the ground;<BR>
The hollow valleys echo to the sound:<BR>
Unmov'd, the royal plant their fury mocks,<BR>
Or, shaken, clings more closely to the rocks;<BR>
Far as he shoots his tow'ring head on high,<BR>
So deep in earth his fix'd foundations lie.<BR>
No less a storm the Trojan hero bears;<BR>
Thick messages and loud complaints he hears,<BR>
And bandied words, still beating on his ears.<BR>
Sighs, groans, and tears proclaim his inward pains;<BR>
But the firm purpose of his heart remains.</P>
<P>The wretched queen, pursued by cruel fate,<BR>
Begins at length the light of heav'n to hate,<BR>
And loathes to live. Then dire portents she sees,<BR>
To hasten on the death her soul decrees:<BR>
Strange to relate! for when, before the shrine,<BR>
She pours in sacrifice the purple wine,<BR>
The purple wine is turn'd to putrid blood,<BR>
And the white offer'd milk converts to mud.<BR>
This dire presage, to her alone reveal'd,<BR>
From all, and ev'n her sister, she conceal'd.<BR>
A marble temple stood within the grove,<BR>
Sacred to death, and to her murther'd love;<BR>
That honor'd chapel she had hung around<BR>
With snowy fleeces, and with garlands crown'd:<BR>
Oft, when she visited this lonely dome,<BR>
Strange voices issued from her husband's tomb;<BR>
She thought she heard him summon her away,<BR>
Invite her to his grave, and chide her stay.<BR>
Hourly 't is heard, when with a boding note<BR>
The solitary screech owl strains her throat,<BR>
And, on a chimney's top, or turret's height,<BR>
With songs obscene disturbs the silence of the night.<BR>
Besides, old prophecies augment her fears;<BR>
And stern Aeneas in her dreams appears,<BR>
Disdainful as by day: she seems, alone,<BR>
To wander in her sleep, thro' ways unknown,<BR>
Guideless and dark; or, in a desart plain,<BR>
To seek her subjects, and to seek in vain:<BR>
Like Pentheus, when, distracted with his fear,<BR>
He saw two suns, and double Thebes, appear;<BR>
Or mad Orestes, when his mother's ghost<BR>
Full in his face infernal torches toss'd,<BR>
And shook her snaky locks: he shuns the sight,<BR>
Flies o'er the stage, surpris'd with mortal fright;<BR>
The Furies guard the door and intercept his flight.</P>
<P>Now, sinking underneath a load of grief,<BR>
From death alone she seeks her last relief;<BR>
The time and means resolv'd within her breast,<BR>
She to her mournful sister thus address'd<BR>
(Dissembling hope, her cloudy front she clears,<BR>
And a false vigor in her eyes appears):<BR>
"Rejoice!" she said. "Instructed from above,<BR>
My lover I shall gain, or lose my love.<BR>
Nigh rising Atlas, next the falling sun,<BR>
Long tracts of Ethiopian climates run:<BR>
There a Massylian priestess I have found,<BR>
Honor'd for age, for magic arts renown'd:<BR>
Th' Hesperian temple was her trusted care;<BR>
'T was she supplied the wakeful dragon's fare.<BR>
She poppy seeds in honey taught to steep,<BR>
Reclaim'd his rage, and sooth'd him into sleep.<BR>
She watch'd the golden fruit; her charms unbind<BR>
The chains of love, or fix them on the mind:<BR>
She stops the torrents, leaves the channel dry,<BR>
Repels the stars, and backward bears the sky.<BR>
The yawning earth rebellows to her call,<BR>
Pale ghosts ascend, and mountain ashes fall.<BR>
Witness, ye gods, and thou my better part,<BR>
How loth I am to try this impious art!<BR>
Within the secret court, with silent care,<BR>
Erect a lofty pile, expos'd in air:<BR>
Hang on the topmost part the Trojan vest,<BR>
Spoils, arms, and presents, of my faithless guest.<BR>
Next, under these, the bridal bed be plac'd,<BR>
Where I my ruin in his arms embrac'd:<BR>
All relics of the wretch are doom'd to fire;<BR>
For so the priestess and her charms require."</P>
<P>Thus far she said, and farther speech forbears;<BR>
A mortal paleness in her face appears:<BR>
Yet the mistrustless Anna could not find<BR>
The secret fun'ral in these rites design'd;<BR>
Nor thought so dire a rage possess'd her mind.<BR>
Unknowing of a train conceal'd so well,<BR>
She fear'd no worse than when Sichaeus fell;<BR>
Therefore obeys. The fatal pile they rear,<BR>
Within the secret court, expos'd in air.<BR>
The cloven holms and pines are heap'd on high,<BR>
And garlands on the hollow spaces lie.<BR>
Sad cypress, vervain, yew, compose the wreath,<BR>
And ev'ry baleful green denoting death.<BR>
The queen, determin'd to the fatal deed,<BR>
The spoils and sword he left, in order spread,<BR>
And the man's image on the nuptial bed.</P>
<P>And now (the sacred altars plac'd around)<BR>
The priestess enters, with her hair unbound,<BR>
And thrice invokes the pow'rs below the ground.<BR>
Night, Erebus, and Chaos she proclaims,<BR>
And threefold Hecate, with her hundred names,<BR>
And three Dianas: next, she sprinkles round<BR>
With feign'd Avernian drops the hallow'd ground;<BR>
Culls hoary simples, found by Phoebe's light,<BR>
With brazen sickles reap'd at noon of night;<BR>
Then mixes baleful juices in the bowl,<BR>
And cuts the forehead of a newborn foal,<BR>
Robbing the mother's love. The destin'd queen<BR>
Observes, assisting at the rites obscene;<BR>
A leaven'd cake in her devoted hands<BR>
She holds, and next the highest altar stands:<BR>
One tender foot was shod, her other bare;<BR>
Girt was her gather'd gown, and loose her hair.<BR>
Thus dress'd, she summon'd, with her dying breath,<BR>
The heav'ns and planets conscious of her death,<BR>
And ev'ry pow'r, if any rules above,<BR>
Who minds, or who revenges, injur'd love.</P>
<P>"'T was dead of night, when weary bodies close<BR>
Their eyes in balmy sleep and soft repose:<BR>
The winds no longer whisper thro' the woods,<BR>
Nor murm'ring tides disturb the gentle floods.<BR>
The stars in silent order mov'd around;<BR>
And Peace, with downy wings, was brooding on the ground<BR>
The flocks and herds, and party-color'd fowl,<BR>
Which haunt the woods, or swim the weedy pool,<BR>
Stretch'd on the quiet earth, securely lay,<BR>
Forgetting the past labors of the day.<BR>
All else of nature's common gift partake:<BR>
Unhappy Dido was alone awake.<BR>
Nor sleep nor ease the furious queen can find;<BR>
Sleep fled her eyes, as quiet fled her mind.<BR>
Despair, and rage, and love divide her heart;<BR>
Despair and rage had some, but love the greater part.</P>
<P>Then thus she said within her secret mind:<BR>
"What shall I do? what succor can I find?<BR>
Become a suppliant to Hyarba's pride,<BR>
And take my turn, to court and be denied?<BR>
Shall I with this ungrateful Trojan go,<BR>
Forsake an empire, and attend a foe?<BR>
Himself I refug'd, and his train reliev'd-<BR>
'T is true- but am I sure to be receiv'd?<BR>
Can gratitude in Trojan souls have place!<BR>
Laomedon still lives in all his race!<BR>
Then, shall I seek alone the churlish crew,<BR>
Or with my fleet their flying sails pursue?<BR>
What force have I but those whom scarce before<BR>
I drew reluctant from their native shore?<BR>
Will they again embark at my desire,<BR>
Once more sustain the seas, and quit their second Tyre?<BR>
Rather with steel thy guilty breast invade,<BR>
And take the fortune thou thyself hast made.<BR>
Your pity, sister, first seduc'd my mind,<BR>
Or seconded too well what I design'd.<BR>
These dear-bought pleasures had I never known,<BR>
Had I continued free, and still my own;<BR>
Avoiding love, I had not found despair,<BR>
But shar'd with salvage beasts the common air.<BR>
Like them, a lonely life I might have led,<BR>
Not mourn'd the living, nor disturb'd the dead."<BR>
These thoughts she brooded in her anxious breast.<BR>
On board, the Trojan found more easy rest.<BR>
Resolv'd to sail, in sleep he pass'd the night;<BR>
And order'd all things for his early flight.</P>
<P>To whom once more the winged god appears;<BR>
His former youthful mien and shape he wears,<BR>
And with this new alarm invades his ears:<BR>
"Sleep'st thou, O goddess-born! and canst thou drown<BR>
Thy needful cares, so near a hostile town,<BR>
Beset with foes; nor hear'st the western gales<BR>
Invite thy passage, and inspire thy sails?<BR>
She harbors in her heart a furious hate,<BR>
And thou shalt find the dire effects too late;<BR>
Fix'd on revenge, and obstinate to die.<BR>
Haste swiftly hence, while thou hast pow'r to fly.<BR>
The sea with ships will soon be cover'd o'er,<BR>
And blazing firebrands kindle all the shore.<BR>
Prevent her rage, while night obscures the skies,<BR>
And sail before the purple morn arise.<BR>
Who knows what hazards thy delay may bring?<BR>
Woman's a various and a changeful thing."<BR>
Thus Hermes in the dream; then took his flight<BR>
Aloft in air unseen, and mix'd with night.</P>
<P>Twice warn'd by the celestial messenger,<BR>
The pious prince arose with hasty fear;<BR>
Then rous'd his drowsy train without delay:<BR>
"Haste to your banks; your crooked anchors weigh,<BR>
And spread your flying sails, and stand to sea.<BR>
A god commands: he stood before my sight,<BR>
And urg'd us once again to speedy flight.<BR>
O sacred pow'r, what pow'r soe'er thou art,<BR>
To thy blest orders I resign my heart.<BR>
Lead thou the way; protect thy Trojan bands,<BR>
And prosper the design thy will commands."<BR>
He said: and, drawing forth his flaming sword,<BR>
His thund'ring arm divides the many-twisted cord.<BR>
An emulating zeal inspires his train:<BR>
They run; they snatch; they rush into the main.<BR>
With headlong haste they leave the desert shores,<BR>
And brush the liquid seas with lab'ring oars.</P>
<P>Aurora now had left her saffron bed,<BR>
And beams of early light the heav'ns o'erspread,<BR>
When, from a tow'r, the queen, with wakeful eyes,<BR>
Saw day point upward from the rosy skies.<BR>
She look'd to seaward; but the sea was void,<BR>
And scarce in ken the sailing ships descried.<BR>
Stung with despite, and furious with despair,<BR>
She struck her trembling breast, and tore her hair.<BR>
"And shall th' ungrateful traitor go," she said,<BR>
"My land forsaken, and my love betray'd?<BR>
Shall we not arm? not rush from ev'ry street,<BR>
To follow, sink, and burn his perjur'd fleet?<BR>
Haste, haul my galleys out! pursue the foe!<BR>
Bring flaming brands! set sail, and swiftly row!<BR>
What have I said? where am I? Fury turns<BR>
My brain; and my distemper'd bosom burns.<BR>
Then, when I gave my person and my throne,<BR>
This hate, this rage, had been more timely shown.<BR>
See now the promis'd faith, the vaunted name,<BR>
The pious man, who, rushing thro' the flame,<BR>
Preserv'd his gods, and to the Phrygian shore<BR>
The burthen of his feeble father bore!<BR>
I should have torn him piecemeal; strow'd in floods<BR>
His scatter'd limbs, or left expos'd in woods;<BR>
Destroy'd his friends and son; and, from the fire,<BR>
Have set the reeking boy before the sire.<BR>
Events are doubtful, which on battles wait:<BR>
Yet where's the doubt, to souls secure of fate?<BR>
My Tyrians, at their injur'd queen's command,<BR>
Had toss'd their fires amid the Trojan band;<BR>
At once extinguish'd all the faithless name;<BR>
And I myself, in vengeance of my shame,<BR>
Had fall'n upon the pile, to mend the fun'ral flame.<BR>
Thou Sun, who view'st at once the world below;<BR>
Thou Juno, guardian of the nuptial vow;<BR>
Thou Hecate hearken from thy dark abodes!<BR>
Ye Furies, fiends, and violated gods,<BR>
All pow'rs invok'd with Dido's dying breath,<BR>
Attend her curses and avenge her death!<BR>
If so the Fates ordain, Jove commands,<BR>
Th' ungrateful wretch should find the Latian lands,<BR>
Yet let a race untam'd, and haughty foes,<BR>
His peaceful entrance with dire arms oppose:<BR>
Oppress'd with numbers in th' unequal field,<BR>
His men discourag'd, and himself expell'd,<BR>
Let him for succor sue from place to place,<BR>
Torn from his subjects, and his son's embrace.<BR>
First, let him see his friends in battle slain,<BR>
And their untimely fate lament in vain;<BR>
And when, at length, the cruel war shall cease,<BR>
On hard conditions may he buy his peace:<BR>
Nor let him then enjoy supreme command;<BR>
But fall, untimely, by some hostile hand,<BR>
And lie unburied on the barren sand!<BR>
These are my pray'rs, and this my dying will;<BR>
And you, my Tyrians, ev'ry curse fulfil.<BR>
Perpetual hate and mortal wars proclaim,<BR>
Against the prince, the people, and the name.<BR>
These grateful off'rings on my grave bestow;<BR>
Nor league, nor love, the hostile nations know!<BR>
Now, and from hence, in ev'ry future age,<BR>
When rage excites your arms, and strength supplies the rage<BR>
Rise some avenger of our Libyan blood,<BR>
With fire and sword pursue the perjur'd brood;<BR>
Our arms, our seas, our shores, oppos'd to theirs;<BR>
And the same hate descend on all our heirs!"</P>
<P>This said, within her anxious mind she weighs<BR>
The means of cutting short her odious days.<BR>
Then to Sichaeus' nurse she briefly said<BR>
(For, when she left her country, hers was dead):<BR>
"Go, Barce, call my sister. Let her care<BR>
The solemn rites of sacrifice prepare;<BR>
The sheep, and all th' atoning off'rings bring,<BR>
Sprinkling her body from the crystal spring<BR>
With living drops; then let her come, and thou<BR>
With sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow.<BR>
Thus will I pay my vows to Stygian Jove,<BR>
And end the cares of my disastrous love;<BR>
Then cast the Trojan image on the fire,<BR>
And, as that burns, my passions shall expire."</P>
<P>The nurse moves onward, with officious care,<BR>
And all the speed her aged limbs can bear.<BR>
But furious Dido, with dark thoughts involv'd,<BR>
Shook at the mighty mischief she resolv'd.<BR>
With livid spots distinguish'd was her face;<BR>
Red were her rolling eyes, and discompos'd her pace;<BR>
Ghastly she gaz'd, with pain she drew her breath,<BR>
And nature shiver'd at approaching death.</P>
<P>Then swiftly to the fatal place she pass'd,<BR>
And mounts the fun'ral pile with furious haste;<BR>
Unsheathes the sword the Trojan left behind<BR>
(Not for so dire an enterprise design'd).<BR>
But when she view'd the garments loosely spread,<BR>
Which once he wore, and saw the conscious bed,<BR>
She paus'd, and with a sigh the robes embrac'd;<BR>
Then on the couch her trembling body cast,<BR>
Repress'd the ready tears, and spoke her last:<BR>
"Dear pledges of my love, while Heav'n so pleas'd,<BR>
Receive a soul, of mortal anguish eas'd:<BR>
My fatal course is finish'd; and I go,<BR>
A glorious name, among the ghosts below.<BR>
A lofty city by my hands is rais'd,<BR>
Pygmalion punish'd, and my lord appeas'd.<BR>
What could my fortune have afforded more,<BR>
Had the false Trojan never touch'd my shore!"<BR>
Then kiss'd the couch; and, "Must I die," she said,<BR>
"And unreveng'd? 'T is doubly to be dead!<BR>
Yet ev'n this death with pleasure I receive:<BR>
On any terms, 't is better than to live.<BR>
These flames, from far, may the false Trojan view;<BR>
These boding omens his base flight pursue!"</P>
<P>She said, and struck; deep enter'd in her side<BR>
The piercing steel, with reeking purple dyed:<BR>
Clogg'd in the wound the cruel weapon stands;<BR>
The spouting blood came streaming on her hands.<BR>
Her sad attendants saw the deadly stroke,<BR>
And with loud cries the sounding palace shook.<BR>
Distracted, from the fatal sight they fled,<BR>
And thro' the town the dismal rumor spread.<BR>
First from the frighted court the yell began;<BR>
Redoubled, thence from house to house it ran:<BR>
The groans of men, with shrieks, laments, and cries<BR>
Of mixing women, mount the vaulted skies.<BR>
Not less the clamor, than if- ancient Tyre,<BR>
Or the new Carthage, set by foes on fire-<BR>
The rolling ruin, with their lov'd abodes,<BR>
Involv'd the blazing temples of their gods.</P>
<P>Her sister hears; and, furious with despair,<BR>
She beats her breast, and rends her yellow hair,<BR>
And, calling on Eliza's name aloud,<BR>
Runs breathless to the place, and breaks the crowd.<BR>
"Was all that pomp of woe for this prepar'd;<BR>
These fires, this fun'ral pile, these altars rear'd?<BR>
Was all this train of plots contriv'd," said she,<BR>
"All only to deceive unhappy me?<BR>
Which is the worst? Didst thou in death pretend<BR>
To scorn thy sister, or delude thy friend?<BR>
Thy summon'd sister, and thy friend, had come;<BR>
One sword had serv'd us both, one common tomb:<BR>
Was I to raise the pile, the pow'rs invoke,<BR>
Not to be present at the fatal stroke?<BR>
At once thou hast destroy'd thyself and me,<BR>
Thy town, thy senate, and thy colony!<BR>
Bring water; bathe the wound; while I in death<BR>
Lay close my lips to hers, and catch the flying breath."<BR>
This said, she mounts the pile with eager haste,<BR>
And in her arms the gasping queen embrac'd;<BR>
Her temples chaf'd; and her own garments tore,<BR>
To stanch the streaming blood, and cleanse the gore.<BR>
Thrice Dido tried to raise her drooping head,<BR>
And, fainting thrice, fell grov'ling on the bed;<BR>
Thrice op'd her heavy eyes, and sought the light,<BR>
But, having found it, sicken'd at the sight,<BR>
And clos'd her lids at last in endless night.</P>
<P>Then Juno, grieving that she should sustain<BR>
A death so ling'ring, and so full of pain,<BR>
Sent Iris down, to free her from the strife<BR>
Of lab'ring nature, and dissolve her life.<BR>
For since she died, not doom'd by Heav'n's decree,<BR>
Or her own crime, but human casualty,<BR>
And rage of love, that plung'd her in despair,<BR>
The Sisters had not cut the topmost hair,<BR>
Which Proserpine and they can only know;<BR>
Nor made her sacred to the shades below.<BR>
Downward the various goddess took her flight,<BR>
And drew a thousand colors from the light;<BR>
Then stood above the dying lover's head,<BR>
And said: "I thus devote thee to the dead.<BR>
This off'ring to th' infernal gods I bear."<BR>
Thus while she spoke, she cut the fatal hair:<BR>
The struggling soul was loos'd, and life dissolv'd in air.</P>
