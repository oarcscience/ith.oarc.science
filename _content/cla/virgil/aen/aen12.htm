<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">BOOK XII</H1>
<P>When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field,<BR>
Their armies broken, and their courage quell'd,<BR>
Himself become the mark of public spite,<BR>
His honor question'd for the promis'd fight;<BR>
The more he was with vulgar hate oppress'd,<BR>
The more his fury boil'd within his breast:<BR>
He rous'd his vigor for the last debate,<BR>
And rais'd his haughty soul to meet his fate.</P>
<P>As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase,<BR>
He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace;<BR>
But, if the pointed jav'lin pierce his side,<BR>
The lordly beast returns with double pride:<BR>
He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain;<BR>
His sides he lashes, and erects his mane:<BR>
So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire,<BR>
Thro' his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire.</P>
<P>Trembling with rage, around the court he ran,<BR>
At length approach'd the king, and thus began:<BR>
"No more excuses or delays: I stand<BR>
In arms prepar'd to combat, hand to hand,<BR>
This base deserter of his native land.<BR>
The Trojan, by his word, is bound to take<BR>
The same conditions which himself did make.<BR>
Renew the truce; the solemn rites prepare,<BR>
And to my single virtue trust the war.<BR>
The Latians unconcern'd shall see the fight;<BR>
This arm unaided shall assert your right:<BR>
Then, if my prostrate body press the plain,<BR>
To him the crown and beauteous bride remain."</P>
<P>To whom the king sedately thus replied:<BR>
"Brave youth, the more your valor has been tried,<BR>
The more becomes it us, with due respect,<BR>
To weigh the chance of war, which you neglect.<BR>
You want not wealth, or a successive throne,<BR>
Or cities which your arms have made your own:<BR>
My towns and treasures are at your command,<BR>
And stor'd with blooming beauties is my land;<BR>
Laurentum more than one Lavinia sees,<BR>
Unmarried, fair, of noble families.<BR>
Now let me speak, and you with patience hear,<BR>
Things which perhaps may grate a lover's ear,<BR>
But sound advice, proceeding from a heart<BR>
Sincerely yours, and free from fraudful art.<BR>
The gods, by signs, have manifestly shown,<BR>
No prince Italian born should heir my throne:<BR>
Oft have our augurs, in prediction skill'd,<BR>
And oft our priests, foreign son reveal'd.<BR>
Yet, won by worth that cannot be withstood,<BR>
Brib'd by my kindness to my kindred blood,<BR>
Urg'd by my wife, who would not be denied,<BR>
I promis'd my Lavinia for your bride:<BR>
Her from her plighted lord by force I took;<BR>
All ties of treaties, and of honor, broke:<BR>
On your account I wag'd an impious war-<BR>
With what success, 't is needless to declare;<BR>
I and my subjects feel, and you have had your share.<BR>
Twice vanquish'd while in bloody fields we strive,<BR>
Scarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive:<BR>
The rolling flood runs warm with human gore;<BR>
The bones of Latians blanch the neighb'ring shore.<BR>
Why put I not an end to this debate,<BR>
Still unresolv'd, and still a slave to fate?<BR>
If Turnus' death a lasting peace can give,<BR>
Why should I not procure it whilst you live?<BR>
Should I to doubtful arms your youth betray,<BR>
What would my kinsmen the Rutulians say?<BR>
And, should you fall in fight, (which Heav'n defend!)<BR>
How curse the cause which hasten'd to his end<BR>
The daughter's lover and the father's friend?<BR>
Weigh in your mind the various chance of war;<BR>
Pity your parent's age, and ease his care."</P>
<P>Such balmy words he pour'd, but all in vain:<BR>
The proffer'd med'cine but provok'd the pain.<BR>
The wrathful youth, disdaining the relief,<BR>
With intermitting sobs thus vents his grief:<BR>
"The care, O best of fathers, which you take<BR>
For my concerns, at my desire forsake.<BR>
Permit me not to languish out my days,<BR>
But make the best exchange of life for praise.<BR>
This arm, this lance, can well dispute the prize;<BR>
And the blood follows, where the weapon flies.<BR>
His goddess mother is not near, to shroud<BR>
The flying coward with an empty cloud."</P>
<P>But now the queen, who fear'd for Turnus' life,<BR>
And loath'd the hard conditions of the strife,<BR>
Held him by force; and, dying in his death,<BR>
In these sad accents gave her sorrow breath:<BR>
"O Turnus, I adjure thee by these tears,<BR>
And whate'er price Amata's honor bears<BR>
Within thy breast, since thou art all my hope,<BR>
My sickly mind's repose, my sinking age's prop;<BR>
Since on the safety of thy life alone<BR>
Depends Latinus, and the Latian throne:<BR>
Refuse me not this one, this only pray'r,<BR>
To waive the combat, and pursue the war.<BR>
Whatever chance attends this fatal strife,<BR>
Think it includes, in thine, Amata's life.<BR>
I cannot live a slave, or see my throne<BR>
Usurp'd by strangers or a Trojan son."</P>
<P>At this, a flood of tears Lavinia shed;<BR>
A crimson blush her beauteous face o'erspread,<BR>
Varying her cheeks by turns with white and red.<BR>
The driving colors, never at a stay,<BR>
Run here and there, and flush, and fade away.<BR>
Delightful change! Thus Indian iv'ry shows,<BR>
Which with the bord'ring paint of purple glows;<BR>
Or lilies damask'd by the neighb'ring rose.</P>
<P>The lover gaz'd, and, burning with desire,<BR>
The more he look'd, the more he fed the fire:<BR>
Revenge, and jealous rage, and secret spite,<BR>
Roll in his breast, and rouse him to the fight.<BR>
Then fixing on the queen his ardent eyes,<BR>
Firm to his first intent, he thus replies:<BR>
"O mother, do not by your tears prepare<BR>
Such boding omens, and prejudge the war.<BR>
Resolv'd on fight, I am no longer free<BR>
To shun my death, if Heav'n my death decree."<BR>
Then turning to the herald, thus pursues:<BR>
"Go, greet the Trojan with ungrateful news;<BR>
Denounce from me, that, when to-morrow's light<BR>
Shall gild the heav'ns, he need not urge the fight;<BR>
The Trojan and Rutulian troops no more<BR>
Shall dye, with mutual blood, the Latian shore:<BR>
Our single swords the quarrel shall decide,<BR>
And to the victor be the beauteous bride."</P>
<P>He said, and striding on, with speedy pace,<BR>
He sought his coursers of the Thracian race.<BR>
At his approach they toss their heads on high,<BR>
And, proudly neighing, promise victory.<BR>
The sires of these Orythia sent from far,<BR>
To grace Pilumnus, when he went to war.<BR>
The drifts of Thracian snows were scarce so white,<BR>
Nor northern winds in fleetness match'd their flight.<BR>
Officious grooms stand ready by his side;<BR>
And some with combs their flowing manes divide,<BR>
And others stroke their chests and gently soothe their pride</P>
<P>He sheath'd his limbs in arms; a temper'd mass<BR>
Of golden metal those, and mountain brass.<BR>
Then to his head his glitt'ring helm he tied,<BR>
And girt his faithful fauchion to his side.<BR>
In his Aetnaean forge, the God of Fire<BR>
That fauchion labor'd for the hero's sire;<BR>
Immortal keenness on the blade bestow'd,<BR>
And plung'd it hissing in the Stygian flood.<BR>
Propp'd on a pillar, which the ceiling bore,<BR>
Was plac'd the lance Auruncan Actor wore;<BR>
Which with such force he brandish'd in his hand,<BR>
The tough ash trembled like an osier wand:<BR>
Then cried: "O pond'rous spoil of Actor slain,<BR>
And never yet by Turnus toss'd in vain,<BR>
Fail not this day thy wonted force; but go,<BR>
Sent by this hand, to pierce the Trojan foe!<BR>
Give me to tear his corslet from his breast,<BR>
And from that eunuch head to rend the crest;<BR>
Dragg'd in the dust, his frizzled hair to soil,<BR>
Hot from the vexing ir'n, and smear'd with fragrant oil!"</P>
<P>Thus while he raves, from his wide nostrils flies<BR>
A fiery steam, and sparkles from his eyes.<BR>
So fares the bull in his lov'd female's sight:<BR>
Proudly he bellows, and preludes the fight;<BR>
He tries his goring horns against a tree,<BR>
And meditates his absent enemy;<BR>
He pushes at the winds; he digs the strand<BR>
With his black hoofs, and spurns the yellow sand.</P>
<P>Nor less the Trojan, in his Lemnian arms,<BR>
To future fight his manly courage warms:<BR>
He whets his fury, and with joy prepares<BR>
To terminate at once the ling'ring wars;<BR>
To cheer his chiefs and tender son, relates<BR>
What Heav'n had promis'd, and expounds the fates.<BR>
Then to the Latian king he sends, to cease<BR>
The rage of arms, and ratify the peace.</P>
<P>The morn ensuing, from the mountain's height,<BR>
Had scarcely spread the skies with rosy light;<BR>
Th' ethereal coursers, bounding from the sea,<BR>
From out their flaming nostrils breath'd the day;<BR>
When now the Trojan and Rutulian guard,<BR>
In friendly labor join'd, the list prepar'd.<BR>
Beneath the walls they measure out the space;<BR>
Then sacred altars rear, on sods of grass,<BR>
Where, with religious their common gods they place.<BR>
In purest white the priests their heads attire;<BR>
And living waters bear, and holy fire;<BR>
And, o'er their linen hoods and shaded hair,<BR>
Long twisted wreaths of sacred veryain wear,</P>
<P>In order issuing from the town appears<BR>
The Latin legion, arm'd with pointed spears;<BR>
And from the fields, advancing on a line,<BR>
The Trojan and the Tuscan forces join:<BR>
Their various arms afford a pleasing sight;<BR>
A peaceful train they seem, in peace prepar'd for fight.<BR>
Betwixt the ranks the proud commanders ride,<BR>
Glitt'ring with gold, and vests in purple dyed;<BR>
Here Mnestheus, author of the Memmian line,<BR>
And there Messapus, born of seed divine.<BR>
The sign is giv'n; and, round the listed space,<BR>
Each man in order fills his proper place.<BR>
Reclining on their ample shields, they stand,<BR>
And fix their pointed lances in the sand.<BR>
Now, studious of the sight, a num'rous throng<BR>
Of either sex promiscuous, old and young,<BR>
Swarm the town: by those who rest behind,<BR>
The gates and walls and houses' tops are lin'd.<BR>
Meantime the Queen of Heav'n beheld the sight,<BR>
With eyes unpleas'd, from Mount Albano's height<BR>
(Since call'd Albano by succeeding fame,<BR>
But then an empty hill, without a name).<BR>
She thence survey'd the field, the Trojan pow'rs,<BR>
The Latian squadrons, and Laurentine tow'rs.<BR>
Then thus the goddess of the skies bespoke,<BR>
With sighs and tears, the goddess of the lake,<BR>
King Turnus' sister, once a lovely maid,<BR>
Ere to the lust of lawless Jove betray'd:<BR>
Compress'd by force, but, by the grateful god,<BR>
Now made the Nais of the neighb'ring flood.<BR>
"O nymph, the pride of living lakes," said she,<BR>
"O most renown'd, and most belov'd by me,<BR>
Long hast thou known, nor need I to record,<BR>
The wanton sallies of my wand'ring lord.<BR>
Of ev'ry Latian fair whom Jove misled<BR>
To mount by stealth my violated bed,<BR>
To thee alone I grudg'd not his embrace,<BR>
But gave a part of heav'n, and an unenvied place.<BR>
Now learn from me thy near approaching grief,<BR>
Nor think my wishes want to thy relief.<BR>
While fortune favor'd, nor Heav'n's King denied<BR>
To lend my succor to the Latian side,<BR>
I sav'd thy brother, and the sinking state:<BR>
But now he struggles with unequal fate,<BR>
And goes, with gods averse, o'ermatch'd in might,<BR>
To meet inevitable death in fight;<BR>
Nor must I break the truce, nor can sustain the sight.<BR>
Thou, if thou dar'st thy present aid supply;<BR>
It well becomes a sister's care to try."</P>
<P>At this the lovely nymph, with grief oppress'd,<BR>
Thrice tore her hair, and beat her comely breast.<BR>
To whom Saturnia thus: "Thy tears are late:<BR>
Haste, snatch him, if he can be snatch'd from fate:<BR>
New tumults kindle; violate the truce:<BR>
Who knows what changeful fortune may produce?<BR>
'T is not a crime t' attempt what I decree;<BR>
Or, if it were, discharge the crime on me."<BR>
She said, and, sailing on the winged wind,<BR>
Left the sad nymph suspended in her mind.</P>
<P>And now pomp the peaceful kings appear:<BR>
Four steeds the chariot of Latinus bear;<BR>
Twelve golden beams around his temples play,<BR>
To mark his lineage from the God of Day.<BR>
Two snowy coursers Turnus' chariot yoke,<BR>
And in his hand two massy spears he shook:<BR>
Then issued from the camp, in arms divine,<BR>
Aeneas, author of the Roman line;<BR>
And by his side Ascanius took his place,<BR>
The second hope of Rome's immortal race.<BR>
Adorn'd in white, a rev'rend priest appears,<BR>
And off'rings to the flaming altars bears;<BR>
A porket, and a lamb that never suffer'd shears.<BR>
Then to the rising sun he turns his eyes,<BR>
And strews the beasts, design'd for sacrifice,<BR>
With salt and meal: with like officious care<BR>
He marks their foreheads, and he clips their hair.<BR>
Betwixt their horns the purple wine he sheds;<BR>
With the same gen'rous juice the flame he feeds.</P>
<P>Aeneas then unsheath'd his shining sword,<BR>
And thus with pious pray'rs the gods ador'd:<BR>
"All-seeing sun, and thou, Ausonian soil,<BR>
For which I have sustain'd so long a toil,<BR>
Thou, King of Heav'n, and thou, the Queen of Air,<BR>
Propitious now, and reconcil'd by pray'r;<BR>
Thou, God of War, whose unresisted sway<BR>
The labors and events of arms obey;<BR>
Ye living fountains, and ye running floods,<BR>
All pow'rs of ocean, all ethereal gods,<BR>
Hear, and bear record: if I fall in field,<BR>
Or, recreant in the fight, to Turnus yield,<BR>
My Trojans shall encrease Evander's town;<BR>
Ascanius shall renounce th' Ausonian crown:<BR>
All claims, all questions of debate, shall cease;<BR>
Nor he, nor they, with force infringe the peace.<BR>
But, if my juster arms prevail in fight,<BR>
(As sure they shall, if I divine aright,)<BR>
My Trojans shall not o'er th' Italians reign:<BR>
Both equal, both unconquer'd shall remain,<BR>
Join'd in their laws, their lands, and their abodes;<BR>
I ask but altars for my weary gods.<BR>
The care of those religious rites be mine;<BR>
The crown to King Latinus I resign:<BR>
His be the sov'reign sway. Nor will I share<BR>
His pow'r in peace, or his command in war.<BR>
For me, my friends another town shall frame,<BR>
And bless the rising tow'rs with fair Lavinia's name."</P>
<P>Thus he. Then, with erected eyes and hands,<BR>
The Latian king before his altar stands.<BR>
"By the same heav'n," said he, "and earth, and main,<BR>
And all the pow'rs that all the three contain;<BR>
By hell below, and by that upper god<BR>
Whose thunder signs the peace, who seals it with his nod;<BR>
So let Latona's double offspring hear,<BR>
And double-fronted Janus, what I swear:<BR>
I touch the sacred altars, touch the flames,<BR>
And all those pow'rs attest, and all their names;<BR>
Whatever chance befall on either side,<BR>
No term of time this union shall divide:<BR>
No force, no fortune, shall my vows unbind,<BR>
Or shake the steadfast tenor of my mind;<BR>
Not tho' the circling seas should break their bound,<BR>
O'erflow the shores, or sap the solid ground;<BR>
Not tho' the lamps of heav'n their spheres forsake,<BR>
Hurl'd down, and hissing in the nether lake:<BR>
Ev'n as this royal scepter" (for he bore<BR>
A scepter in his hand) "shall never more<BR>
Shoot out in branches, or renew the birth:<BR>
An orphan now, cut from the mother earth<BR>
By the keen ax, dishonor'd of its hair,<BR>
And cas'd in brass, for Latian kings to bear."</P>
<P>When thus in public view the peace was tied<BR>
With solemn vows, and sworn on either side,<BR>
All dues perform'd which holy rites require;<BR>
The victim beasts are slain before the fire,<BR>
The trembling entrails from their bodies torn,<BR>
And to the fatten'd flames in chargers borne.</P>
<P>Already the Rutulians deem their man<BR>
O'ermatch'd in arms, before the fight began.<BR>
First rising fears are whisper'd thro' the crowd;<BR>
Then, gath'ring sound, they murmur more aloud.<BR>
Now, side to side, they measure with their eyes<BR>
The champions' bulk, their sinews, and their size:<BR>
The nearer they approach, the more is known<BR>
Th' apparent disadvantage of their own.<BR>
Turnus himself appears in public sight<BR>
Conscious of fate, desponding of the fight.<BR>
Slowly he moves, and at his altar stands<BR>
With eyes dejected, and with trembling hands;<BR>
And, while he mutters undistinguish'd pray'rs,<BR>
A livid deadness in his cheeks appears.</P>
<P>With anxious pleasure when Juturna view'd<BR>
Th' increasing fright of the mad multitude,<BR>
When their short sighs and thick'ning sobs she heard,<BR>
And found their ready minds for change prepar'd;<BR>
Dissembling her immortal form, she took<BR>
Camertus' mien, his habit, and his look;<BR>
A chief of ancient blood; in arms well known<BR>
Was his great sire, and he his greater son.<BR>
His shape assum'd, amid the ranks she ran,<BR>
And humoring their first motions, thus began:<BR>
"For shame, Rutulians, can you bear the sight<BR>
Of one expos'd for all, in single fight?<BR>
Can we, before the face of heav'n, confess<BR>
Our courage colder, or our numbers less?<BR>
View all the Trojan host, th' Arcadian band,<BR>
And Tuscan army; count 'em as they stand:<BR>
Undaunted to the battle if we go,<BR>
Scarce ev'ry second man will share a foe.<BR>
Turnus, 't is true, in this unequal strife,<BR>
Shall lose, with honor, his devoted life,<BR>
Or change it rather for immortal fame,<BR>
Succeeding to the gods, from whence he came:<BR>
But you, a servile and inglorious band,<BR>
For foreign lords shall sow your native land,<BR>
Those fruitful fields your fighting fathers gain'd,<BR>
Which have so long their lazy sons sustain'd."<BR>
With words like these, she carried her design:<BR>
A rising murmur runs along the line.<BR>
Then ev'n the city troops, and Latians, tir'd<BR>
With tedious war, seem with new souls inspir'd:<BR>
Their champion's fate with pity they lament,<BR>
And of the league, so lately sworn, repent.</P>
<P>Nor fails the goddess to foment the rage<BR>
With lying wonders, and a false presage;<BR>
But adds a sign, which, present to their eyes,<BR>
Inspires new courage, and a glad surprise.<BR>
For, sudden, in the fiery tracts above,<BR>
Appears in pomp th' imperial bird of Jove:<BR>
A plump of fowl he spies, that swim the lakes,<BR>
And o'er their heads his sounding pinions shakes;<BR>
Then, stooping on the fairest of the train,<BR>
In his strong talons truss'd a silver swan.<BR>
Th' Italians wonder at th' unusual sight;<BR>
But, while he lags, and labors in his flight,<BR>
Behold, the dastard fowl return anew,<BR>
And with united force the foe pursue:<BR>
Clam'rous around the royal hawk they fly,<BR>
And, thick'ning in a cloud, o'ershade the sky.<BR>
They cuff, they scratch, they cross his airy course;<BR>
Nor can th' incumber'd bird sustain their force;<BR>
But vex'd, not vanquish'd, drops the pond'rous prey,<BR>
And, lighten'd of his burthen, wings his way.</P>
<P>Th' Ausonian bands with shouts salute the sight,<BR>
Eager of action, and demand the fight.<BR>
Then King Tolumnius, vers'd in augurs' arts,<BR>
Cries out, and thus his boasted skill imparts:<BR>
"At length 't is granted, what I long desir'd!<BR>
This, this is what my frequent vows requir'd.<BR>
Ye gods, I take your omen, and obey.<BR>
Advance, my friends, and charge! I lead the way.<BR>
These are the foreign foes, whose impious band,<BR>
Like that rapacious bird, infest our land:<BR>
But soon, like him, they shall be forc'd to sea<BR>
By strength united, and forego the prey.<BR>
Your timely succor to your country bring,<BR>
Haste to the rescue, and redeem your king."</P>
<P>He said; and, pressing onward thro' the crew,<BR>
Pois'd in his lifted arm, his lance he threw.<BR>
The winged weapon, whistling in the wind,<BR>
Came driving on, nor miss'd the mark design'd.<BR>
At once the cornel rattled in the skies;<BR>
At once tumultuous shouts and clamors rise.<BR>
Nine brothers in a goodly band there stood,<BR>
Born of Arcadian mix'd with Tuscan blood,<BR>
Gylippus' sons: the fatal jav'lin flew,<BR>
Aim'd at the midmost of the friendly crew.<BR>
A passage thro' the jointed arms it found,<BR>
Just where the belt was to the body bound,<BR>
And struck the gentle youth extended on the ground.<BR>
Then, fir'd with pious rage, the gen'rous train<BR>
Run madly forward to revenge the slain.<BR>
And some with eager haste their jav'lins throw;<BR>
And some with sword in hand assault the foe.</P>
<P>The wish'd insult the Latine troops embrace,<BR>
And meet their ardor in the middle space.<BR>
The Trojans, Tuscans, and Arcadian line,<BR>
With equal courage obviate their design.<BR>
Peace leaves the violated fields, and hate<BR>
Both armies urges to their mutual fate.<BR>
With impious haste their altars are o'erturn'd,<BR>
The sacrifice half-broil'd, and half-unburn'd.<BR>
Thick storms of steel from either army fly,<BR>
And clouds of clashing darts obscure the sky;<BR>
Brands from the fire are missive weapons made,<BR>
With chargers, bowls, and all the priestly trade.<BR>
Latinus, frighted, hastens from the fray,<BR>
And bears his unregarded gods away.<BR>
These on their horses vault; those yoke the car;<BR>
The rest, with swords on high, run headlong to the war.</P>
<P>Messapus, eager to confound the peace,<BR>
Spurr'd his hot courser thro' the fighting prease,<BR>
At King Aulestes, by his purple known<BR>
A Tuscan prince, and by his regal crown;<BR>
And, with a shock encount'ring, bore him down.<BR>
Backward he fell; and, as his fate design'd,<BR>
The ruins of an altar were behind:<BR>
There, pitching on his shoulders and his head,<BR>
Amid the scatt'ring fires he lay supinely spread.<BR>
The beamy spear, descending from above,<BR>
His cuirass pierc'd, and thro' his body drove.<BR>
Then, with a scornful smile, the victor cries:<BR>
"The gods have found a fitter sacrifice."<BR>
Greedy of spoils, th' Italians strip the dead<BR>
Of his rich armor, and uncrown his head.</P>
<P>Priest Corynaeus, arm'd his better hand,<BR>
From his own altar, with a blazing brand;<BR>
And, as Ebusus with a thund'ring pace<BR>
Advanc'd to battle, dash'd it on his face:<BR>
His bristly beard shines out with sudden fires;<BR>
The crackling crop a noisome scent expires.<BR>
Following the blow, he seiz'd his curling crown<BR>
With his left hand; his other cast him down.<BR>
The prostrate body with his knees he press'd,<BR>
And plung'd his holy poniard in his breast.</P>
<P>While Podalirius, with his sword, pursued<BR>
The shepherd Alsus thro' the flying crowd,<BR>
Swiftly he turns, and aims a deadly blow<BR>
Full on the front of his unwary foe.<BR>
The broad ax enters with a crashing sound,<BR>
And cleaves the chin with one continued wound;<BR>
Warm blood, and mingled brains, besmear his arms around<BR>
An iron sleep his stupid eyes oppress'd,<BR>
And seal'd their heavy lids in endless rest.</P>
<P>But good Aeneas rush'd amid the bands;<BR>
Bare was his head, and naked were his hands,<BR>
In sign of truce: then thus he cries aloud:<BR>
"What sudden rage, what new desire of blood,<BR>
Inflames your alter'd minds? O Trojans, cease<BR>
From impious arms, nor violate the peace!<BR>
By human sanctions, and by laws divine,<BR>
The terms are all agreed; the war is mine.<BR>
Dismiss your fears, and let the fight ensue;<BR>
This hand alone shall right the gods and you:<BR>
Our injur'd altars, and their broken vow,<BR>
To this avenging sword the faithless Turnus owe."</P>
<P>Thus while he spoke, unmindful of defense,<BR>
A winged arrow struck the pious prince.<BR>
But, whether from some human hand it came,<BR>
Or hostile god, is left unknown by fame:<BR>
No human hand or hostile god was found,<BR>
To boast the triumph of so base a wound.</P>
<P>When Turnus saw the Trojan quit the plain,<BR>
His chiefs dismay'd, his troops a fainting train,<BR>
Th' unhop'd event his heighten'd soul inspires:<BR>
At once his arms and coursers he requires;<BR>
Then, with a leap, his lofty chariot gains,<BR>
And with a ready hand assumes the reins.<BR>
He drives impetuous, and, where'er he goes,<BR>
He leaves behind a lane of slaughter'd foes.<BR>
These his lance reaches; over those he rolls<BR>
His rapid car, and crushes out their souls:<BR>
In vain the vanquish'd fly; the victor sends<BR>
The dead men's weapons at their living friends.<BR>
Thus, on the banks of Hebrus' freezing flood,<BR>
The God of Battles, in his angry mood,<BR>
Clashing his sword against his brazen shield,<BR>
Let loose the reins, and scours along the field:<BR>
Before the wind his fiery coursers fly;<BR>
Groans the sad earth, resounds the rattling sky.<BR>
Wrath, Terror, Treason, Tumult, and Despair<BR>
(Dire faces, and deform'd) surround the car;<BR>
Friends of the god, and followers of the war.<BR>
With fury not unlike, nor less disdain,<BR>
Exulting Turnus flies along the plain:<BR>
His smoking horses, at their utmost speed,<BR>
He lashes on, and urges o'er the dead.<BR>
Their fetlocks run with blood; and, when they bound,<BR>
The gore and gath'ring dust are dash'd around.<BR>
Thamyris and Pholus, masters of the war,<BR>
He kill'd at hand, but Sthenelus afar:<BR>
From far the sons of Imbracus he slew,<BR>
Glaucus and Lades, of the Lycian crew;<BR>
Both taught to fight on foot, in battle join'd,<BR>
Or mount the courser that outstrips the wind.</P>
<P>Meantime Eumedes, vaunting in the field,<BR>
New fir'd the Trojans, and their foes repell'd.<BR>
This son of Dolon bore his grandsire's name,<BR>
But emulated more his father's fame;<BR>
His guileful father, sent a nightly spy,<BR>
The Grecian camp and order to descry:<BR>
Hard enterprise! and well he might require<BR>
Achilles' car and horses, for his hire:<BR>
But, met upon the scout, th' Aetolian prince<BR>
In death bestow'd a juster recompense.<BR>
Fierce Turnus view'd the Trojan from afar,<BR>
And launch'd his jav'lin from his lofty car;<BR>
Then lightly leaping down, pursued the blow,<BR>
And, pressing with his foot his prostrate foe,<BR>
Wrench'd from his feeble hold the shining sword,<BR>
And plung'd it in the bosom of its lord.<BR>
"Possess," said he, "the fruit of all thy pains,<BR>
And measure, at thy length, our Latian plains.<BR>
Thus are my foes rewarded by my hand;<BR>
Thus may they build their town, and thus enjoy the land!"</P>
<P>Then Dares, Butes, Sybaris he slew,<BR>
Whom o'er his neck his flound'ring courser threw.<BR>
As when loud Boreas, with his blust'ring train,<BR>
Stoops from above, incumbent on the main;<BR>
Where'er he flies, he drives the rack before,<BR>
And rolls the billows on th' Aegaean shore:<BR>
So, where resistless Turnus takes his course,<BR>
The scatter'd squadrons bend before his force;<BR>
His crest of horses' hair is blown behind<BR>
By adverse air, and rustles in the wind.</P>
<P>This haughty Phegeus saw with high disdain,<BR>
And, as the chariot roll'd along the plain,<BR>
Light from the ground he leapt, and seiz'd the rein.<BR>
Thus hung in air, he still retain'd his hold,<BR>
The coursers frighted, and their course controll'd.<BR>
The lance of Turnus reach'd him as he hung,<BR>
And pierc'd his plated arms, but pass'd along,<BR>
And only raz'd the skin. He turn'd, and held<BR>
Against his threat'ning foe his ample shield;<BR>
Then call'd for aid: but, while he cried in vain,<BR>
The chariot bore him backward on the plain.<BR>
He lies revers'd; the victor king descends,<BR>
And strikes so justly where his helmet ends,<BR>
He lops the head. The Latian fields are drunk<BR>
With streams that issue from the bleeding trunk.</P>
<P>While he triumphs, and while the Trojans yield,<BR>
The wounded prince is forc'd to leave the field:<BR>
Strong Mnestheus, and Achates often tried,<BR>
And young Ascanius, weeping by his side,<BR>
Conduct him to his tent. Scarce can he rear<BR>
His limbs from earth, supported on his spear.<BR>
Resolv'd in mind, regardless of the smart,<BR>
He tugs with both his hands, and breaks the dart.<BR>
The steel remains. No readier way he found<BR>
To draw the weapon, than t' inlarge the wound.<BR>
Eager of fight, impatient of delay,<BR>
He begs; and his unwilling friends obey.</P>
<P>Iapis was at hand to prove his art,<BR>
Whose blooming youth so fir'd Apollo's heart,<BR>
That, for his love, he proffer'd to bestow<BR>
His tuneful harp and his unerring bow.<BR>
The pious youth, more studious how to save<BR>
His aged sire, now sinking to the grave,<BR>
Preferr'd the pow'r of plants, and silent praise<BR>
Of healing arts, before Phoebean bays.</P>
<P>Propp'd on his lance the pensive hero stood,<BR>
And heard and saw, unmov'd, the mourning crowd.<BR>
The fam'd physician tucks his robes around<BR>
With ready hands, and hastens to the wound.<BR>
With gentle touches he performs his part,<BR>
This way and that, soliciting the dart,<BR>
And exercises all his heav'nly art.<BR>
All soft'ning simples, known of sov'reign use,<BR>
He presses out, and pours their noble juice.<BR>
These first infus'd, to lenify the pain,<BR>
He tugs with pincers, but he tugs in vain.<BR>
Then to the patron of his art he pray'd:<BR>
The patron of his art refus'd his aid.</P>
<P>Meantime the war approaches to the tents;<BR>
Th' alarm grows hotter, and the noise augments:<BR>
The driving dust proclaims the danger near;<BR>
And first their friends, and then their foes appear:<BR>
Their friends retreat; their foes pursue the rear.<BR>
The camp is fill'd with terror and affright:<BR>
The hissing shafts within the trench alight;<BR>
An undistinguish'd noise ascends the sky,<BR>
The shouts those who kill, and groans of those who die.</P>
<P>But now the goddess mother, mov'd with grief,<BR>
And pierc'd with pity, hastens her relief.<BR>
A branch of healing dittany she brought,<BR>
Which in the Cretan fields with care she sought:<BR>
Rough is the stern, which woolly leafs surround;<BR>
The leafs with flow'rs, the flow'rs with purple crown'd,<BR>
Well known to wounded goats; a sure relief<BR>
To draw the pointed steel, and ease the grief.<BR>
This Venus brings, in clouds involv'd, and brews<BR>
Th' extracted liquor with ambrosian dews,<BR>
And odorous panacee. Unseen she stands,<BR>
Temp'ring the mixture with her heav'nly hands,<BR>
And pours it in a bowl, already crown'd<BR>
With juice of med'c'nal herbs prepar'd to bathe the wound.<BR>
The leech, unknowing of superior art<BR>
Which aids the cure, with this foments the part;<BR>
And in a moment ceas'd the raging smart.<BR>
Stanch'd is the blood, and in the bottom stands:<BR>
The steel, but scarcely touch'd with tender hands,<BR>
Moves up, and follows of its own accord,<BR>
And health and vigor are at once restor'd.<BR>
Iapis first perceiv'd the closing wound,<BR>
And first the footsteps of a god he found.<BR>
"Arms! arms!" he cries; "the sword and shield prepare,<BR>
And send the willing chief, renew'd, to war.<BR>
This is no mortal work, no cure of mine,<BR>
Nor art's effect, but done by hands divine.<BR>
Some god our general to the battle sends;<BR>
Some god preserves his life for greater ends."</P>
<P>The hero arms in haste; his hands infold<BR>
His thighs with cuishes of refulgent gold:<BR>
Inflam'd to fight, and rushing to the field,<BR>
That hand sustaining the celestial shield,<BR>
This gripes the lance, and with such vigor shakes,<BR>
That to the rest the beamy weapon quakes.<BR>
Then with a close embrace he strain'd his son,<BR>
And, kissing thro' his helmet, thus begun:<BR>
"My son, from my example learn the war,<BR>
In camps to suffer, and in fields to dare;<BR>
But happier chance than mine attend thy care!<BR>
This day my hand thy tender age shall shield,<BR>
And crown with honors of the conquer'd field:<BR>
Thou, when thy riper years shall send thee forth<BR>
To toils of war, be mindful of my worth;<BR>
Assert thy birthright, and in arms be known,<BR>
For Hector's nephew, and Aeneas' son."<BR>
He said; and, striding, issued on the plain.<BR>
Anteus and Mnestheus, and a num'rous train,<BR>
Attend his steps; the rest their weapons take,<BR>
And, crowding to the field, the camp forsake.<BR>
A cloud of blinding dust is rais'd around,<BR>
Labors beneath their feet the trembling ground.</P>
<P>Now Turnus, posted on a hill, from far<BR>
Beheld the progress of the moving war:<BR>
With him the Latins view'd the cover'd plains,<BR>
And the chill blood ran backward in their veins.<BR>
Juturna saw th' advancing troops appear,<BR>
And heard the hostile sound, and fled for fear.<BR>
Aeneas leads; and draws a sweeping train,<BR>
Clos'd in their ranks, and pouring on the plain.<BR>
As when a whirlwind, rushing to the shore<BR>
From the mid ocean, drives the waves before;<BR>
The painful hind with heavy heart foresees<BR>
The flatted fields, and slaughter of the trees;<BR>
With like impetuous rage the prince appears<BR>
Before his doubled front, nor less destruction bears.<BR>
And now both armies shock in open field;<BR>
Osiris is by strong Thymbraeus kill'd.<BR>
Archetius, Ufens, Epulon, are slain<BR>
(All fam'd in arms, and of the Latian train)<BR>
By Gyas', Mnestheus', and Achates' hand.<BR>
The fatal augur falls, by whose command<BR>
The truce was broken, and whose lance, embrued<BR>
With Trojan blood, th' unhappy fight renew'd.<BR>
Loud shouts and clamors rend the liquid sky,<BR>
And o'er the field the frighted Latins fly.<BR>
The prince disdains the dastards to pursue,<BR>
Nor moves to meet in arms the fighting few;<BR>
Turnus alone, amid the dusky plain,<BR>
He seeks, and to the combat calls in vain.<BR>
Juturna heard, and, seiz'd with mortal fear,<BR>
Forc'd from the beam her brother's charioteer;<BR>
Assumes his shape, his armor, and his mien,<BR>
And, like Metiscus, in his seat is seen.</P>
<P>As the black swallow near the palace plies;<BR>
O'er empty courts, and under arches, flies;<BR>
Now hawks aloft, now skims along the flood,<BR>
To furnish her loquacious nest with food:<BR>
So drives the rapid goddess o'er the plains;<BR>
The smoking horses run with loosen'd reins.<BR>
She steers a various course among the foes;<BR>
Now here, now there, her conqu'ring brother shows;<BR>
Now with a straight, now with a wheeling flight,<BR>
She turns, and bends, but shuns the single fight.<BR>
Aeneas, fir'd with fury, breaks the crowd,<BR>
And seeks his foe, and calls by name aloud:<BR>
He runs within a narrower ring, and tries<BR>
To stop the chariot; but the chariot flies.<BR>
If he but gain a glimpse, Juturna fears,<BR>
And far away the Daunian hero bears.</P>
<P>What should he do! Nor arts nor arms avail;<BR>
And various cares in vain his mind assail.<BR>
The great Messapus, thund'ring thro' the field,<BR>
In his left hand two pointed jav'lins held:<BR>
Encount'ring on the prince, one dart he drew,<BR>
And with unerring aim and utmost vigor threw.<BR>
Aeneas saw it come, and, stooping low<BR>
Beneath his buckler, shunn'd the threat'ning blow.<BR>
The weapon hiss'd above his head, and tore<BR>
The waving plume which on his helm he wore.<BR>
Forced by this hostile act, and fir'd with spite,<BR>
That flying Turnus still declin'd the fight,<BR>
The Prince, whose piety had long repell'd<BR>
His inborn ardor, now invades the field;<BR>
Invokes the pow'rs of violated peace,<BR>
Their rites and injur'd altars to redress;<BR>
Then, to his rage abandoning the rein,<BR>
With blood and slaughter'd bodies fills the plain.</P>
<P>What god can tell, what numbers can display,<BR>
The various labors of that fatal day;<BR>
What chiefs and champions fell on either side,<BR>
In combat slain, or by what deaths they died;<BR>
Whom Turnus, whom the Trojan hero kill'd;<BR>
Who shar'd the fame and fortune of the field!<BR>
Jove, could'st thou view, and not avert thy sight,<BR>
Two jarring nations join'd in cruel fight,<BR>
Whom leagues of lasting love so shortly shall unite!</P>
<P>Aeneas first Rutulian Sucro found,<BR>
Whose valor made the Trojans quit their ground;<BR>
Betwixt his ribs the jav'lin drove so just,<BR>
It reach'd his heart, nor needs a second thrust.<BR>
Now Turnus, at two blows, two brethren slew;<BR>
First from his horse fierce Amycus he threw:<BR>
Then, leaping on the ground, on foot assail'd<BR>
Diores, and in equal fight prevail'd.<BR>
Their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place;<BR>
Their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace.</P>
<P>Three cold on earth the Trojan hero threw,<BR>
Whom without respite at one charge he slew:<BR>
Cethegus, Tanais, Tagus, fell oppress'd,<BR>
And sad Onythes, added to the rest,<BR>
Of Theban blood, whom Peridia bore.</P>
<P>Turnus two brothers from the Lycian shore,<BR>
And from Apollo's fane to battle sent,<BR>
O'erthrew; nor Phoebus could their fate prevent.<BR>
Peaceful Menoetes after these he kill'd,<BR>
Who long had shunn'd the dangers of the field:<BR>
On Lerna's lake a silent life he led,<BR>
And with his nets and angle earn'd his bread;<BR>
Nor pompous cares, nor palaces, he knew,<BR>
But wisely from th' infectious world withdrew:<BR>
Poor was his house; his father's painful hand<BR>
Discharg'd his rent, and plow'd another's land.</P>
<P>As flames among the lofty woods are thrown<BR>
On diff'rent sides, and both by winds are blown;<BR>
The laurels crackle in the sputt'ring fire;<BR>
The frighted sylvans from their shades retire:<BR>
Or as two neighb'ring torrents fall from high;<BR>
Rapid they run; the foamy waters fry;<BR>
They roll to sea with unresisted force,<BR>
And down the rocks precipitate their course:<BR>
Not with less rage the rival heroes take<BR>
Their diff'rent ways, nor less destruction make.<BR>
With spears afar, with swords at hand, they strike;<BR>
And zeal of slaughter fires their souls alike.<BR>
Like them, their dauntless men maintain the field;<BR>
And hearts are pierc'd, unknowing how to yield:<BR>
They blow for blow return, and wound for wound;<BR>
And heaps of bodies raise the level ground.</P>
<P>Murranus, boasting of his blood, that springs<BR>
From a long royal race of Latian kings,<BR>
Is by the Trojan from his chariot thrown,<BR>
Crush'd with the weight of an unwieldy stone:<BR>
Betwixt the wheels he fell; the wheels, that bore<BR>
His living load, his dying body tore.<BR>
His starting steeds, to shun the glitt'ring sword,<BR>
Paw down his trampled limbs, forgetful of their lord.</P>
<P>Fierce Hyllus threaten'd high, and, face to face,<BR>
Affronted Turnus in the middle space:<BR>
The prince encounter'd him in full career,<BR>
And at his temples aim'd the deadly spear;<BR>
So fatally the flying weapon sped,<BR>
That thro' his helm it pierc'd his head.<BR>
Nor, Cisseus, couldst thou scape from Turnus' hand,<BR>
In vain the strongest of th' Arcadian band:<BR>
Nor to Cupentus could his gods afford<BR>
Availing aid against th' Aenean sword,<BR>
Which to his naked heart pursued the course;<BR>
Nor could his plated shield sustain the force.</P>
<P>Iolas fell, whom not the Grecian pow'rs,<BR>
Nor great subverter of the Trojan tow'rs,<BR>
Were doom'd to kill, while Heav'n prolong'd his date;<BR>
But who can pass the bounds, prefix'd by fate?<BR>
In high Lyrnessus, and in Troy, he held<BR>
Two palaces, and was from each expell'd:<BR>
Of all the mighty man, the last remains<BR>
A little spot of foreign earth contains.</P>
<P>And now both hosts their broken troops unite<BR>
In equal ranks, and mix in mortal fight.<BR>
Seresthus and undaunted Mnestheus join<BR>
The Trojan, Tuscan, and Arcadian line:<BR>
Sea-born Messapus, with Atinas, heads<BR>
The Latin squadrons, and to battle leads.<BR>
They strike, they push, they throng the scanty space,<BR>
Resolv'd on death, impatient of disgrace;<BR>
And, where one falls, another fills his place.</P>
<P>The Cyprian goddess now inspires her son<BR>
To leave th' unfinish'd fight, and storm the town:<BR>
For, while he rolls his eyes around the plain<BR>
In quest of Turnus, whom he seeks in vain,<BR>
He views th' unguarded city from afar,<BR>
In careless quiet, and secure of war.<BR>
Occasion offers, and excites his mind<BR>
To dare beyond the task he first design'd.<BR>
Resolv'd, he calls his chiefs; they leave the fight:<BR>
Attended thus, he takes a neighb'ring height;<BR>
The crowding troops about their gen'ral stand,<BR>
All under arms, and wait his high command.<BR>
Then thus the lofty prince: "Hear and obey,<BR>
Ye Trojan bands, without the least delay<BR>
Jove is with us; and what I have decreed<BR>
Requires our utmost vigor, and our speed.<BR>
Your instant arms against the town prepare,<BR>
The source of mischief, and the seat of war.<BR>
This day the Latian tow'rs, that mate the sky,<BR>
Shall level with the plain in ashes lie:<BR>
The people shall be slaves, unless in time<BR>
They kneel for pardon, and repent their crime.<BR>
Twice have our foes been vanquish'd on the plain:<BR>
Then shall I wait till Turnus will be slain?<BR>
Your force against the perjur'd city bend.<BR>
There it began, and there the war shall end.<BR>
The peace profan'd our rightful arms requires;<BR>
Cleanse the polluted place with purging fires."</P>
<P>He finish'd; and, one soul inspiring all,<BR>
Form'd in a wedge, the foot approach the wall.<BR>
Without the town, an unprovided train<BR>
Of gaping, gazing citizens are slain.<BR>
Some firebrands, others scaling ladders bear,<BR>
And those they toss aloft, and these they rear:<BR>
The flames now launch'd, the feather'd arrows fly,<BR>
And clouds of missive arms obscure the sky.<BR>
Advancing to the front, the hero stands,<BR>
And, stretching out to heav'n his pious hands,<BR>
Attests the gods, asserts his innocence,<BR>
Upbraids with breach of faith th' Ausonian prince;<BR>
Declares the royal honor doubly stain'd,<BR>
And twice the rites of holy peace profan'd.</P>
<P>Dissenting clamors in the town arise;<BR>
Each will be heard, and all at once advise.<BR>
One part for peace, and one for war contends;<BR>
Some would exclude their foes, and some admit their friends.<BR>
The helpless king is hurried in the throng,<BR>
And, whate'er tide prevails, is borne along.<BR>
Thus, when the swain, within a hollow rock,<BR>
Invades the bees with suffocating smoke,<BR>
They run around, or labor on their wings,<BR>
Disus'd to flight, and shoot their sleepy stings;<BR>
To shun the bitter fumes in vain they try;<BR>
Black vapors, issuing from the vent, involve the sky.</P>
<P>But fate and envious fortune now prepare<BR>
To plunge the Latins in the last despair.<BR>
The queen, who saw the foes invade the town,<BR>
And brands on tops of burning houses thrown,<BR>
Cast round her eyes, distracted with her fear-<BR>
No troops of Turnus in the field appear.<BR>
Once more she stares abroad, but still in vain,<BR>
And then concludes the royal youth is slain.<BR>
Mad with her anguish, impotent to bear<BR>
The mighty grief, she loathes the vital air.<BR>
She calls herself the cause of all this ill,<BR>
And owns the dire effects of her ungovern'd will;<BR>
She raves against the gods; she beats her breast;<BR>
She tears with both her hands her purple vest:<BR>
Then round a beam a running noose she tied,<BR>
And, fasten'd by the neck, obscenely died.</P>
<P>Soon as the fatal news by Fame was blown,<BR>
And to her dames and to her daughter known,<BR>
The sad Lavinia rends her yellow hair<BR>
And rosy cheeks; the rest her sorrow share:<BR>
With shrieks the palace rings, and madness of despair.<BR>
The spreading rumor fills the public place:<BR>
Confusion, fear, distraction, and disgrace,<BR>
And silent shame, are seen in ev'ry face.<BR>
Latinus tears his garments as he goes,<BR>
Both for his public and his private woes;<BR>
With filth his venerable beard besmears,<BR>
And sordid dust deforms his silver hairs.<BR>
And much he blames the softness of his mind,<BR>
Obnoxious to the charms of womankind,<BR>
And soon seduc'd to change what he so well design'd;<BR>
To break the solemn league so long desir'd,<BR>
Nor finish what his fates, and those of Troy, requir'd.</P>
<P>Now Turnus rolls aloof o'er empty plains,<BR>
And here and there some straggling foes he gleans.<BR>
His flying coursers please him less and less,<BR>
Asham'd of easy fight and cheap success.<BR>
Thus half-contented, anxious in his mind,<BR>
The distant cries come driving in the wind,<BR>
Shouts from the walls, but shouts in murmurs drown'd;<BR>
A jarring mixture, and a boding sound.<BR>
"Alas!" said he, "what mean these dismal cries?<BR>
What doleful clamors from the town arise?"<BR>
Confus'd, he stops, and backward pulls the reins.<BR>
She who the driver's office now sustains,<BR>
Replies: "Neglect, my lord, these new alarms;<BR>
Here fight, and urge the fortune of your arms:<BR>
There want not others to defend the wall.<BR>
If by your rival's hand th' Italians fall,<BR>
So shall your fatal sword his friends oppress,<BR>
In honor equal, equal in success."</P>
<P>To this, the prince: "O sister- for I knew<BR>
The peace infring'd proceeded first from you;<BR>
I knew you, when you mingled first in fight;<BR>
And now in vain you would deceive my sight-<BR>
Why, goddess, this unprofitable care?<BR>
Who sent you down from heav'n, involv'd in air,<BR>
Your share of mortal sorrows to sustain,<BR>
And see your brother bleeding on the plain?<BR>
For to what pow'r can Turnus have recourse,<BR>
Or how resist his fate's prevailing force?<BR>
These eyes beheld Murranus bite the ground:<BR>
Mighty the man, and mighty was the wound.<BR>
I heard my dearest friend, with dying breath,<BR>
My name invoking to revenge his death.<BR>
Brave Ufens fell with honor on the place,<BR>
To shun the shameful sight of my disgrace.<BR>
On earth supine, a manly corpse he lies;<BR>
His vest and armor are the victor's prize.<BR>
Then, shall I see Laurentum in a flame,<BR>
Which only wanted, to complete my shame?<BR>
How will the Latins hoot their champion's flight!<BR>
How Drances will insult and point them to the sight!<BR>
Is death so hard to bear? Ye gods below,<BR>
(Since those above so small compassion show,)<BR>
Receive a soul unsullied yet with shame,<BR>
Which not belies my great forefather's name!"</P>
<P>He said; and while he spoke, with flying speed<BR>
Came Sages urging on his foamy steed:<BR>
Fix'd on his wounded face a shaft he bore,<BR>
And, seeking Turnus, sent his voice before:<BR>
"Turnus, on you, on you alone, depends<BR>
Our last relief: compassionate your friends!<BR>
Like lightning, fierce Aeneas, rolling on,<BR>
With arms invests, with flames invades the town:<BR>
The brands are toss'd on high; the winds conspire<BR>
To drive along the deluge of the fire.<BR>
All eyes are fix'd on you: your foes rejoice;<BR>
Ev'n the king staggers, and suspends his choice;<BR>
Doubts to deliver or defend the town,<BR>
Whom to reject, or whom to call his son.<BR>
The queen, on whom your utmost hopes were plac'd,<BR>
Herself suborning death, has breath'd her last.<BR>
'T is true, Messapus, fearless of his fate,<BR>
With fierce Atinas' aid, defends the gate:<BR>
On ev'ry side surrounded by the foe,<BR>
The more they kill, the greater numbers grow;<BR>
An iron harvest mounts, and still remains to mow.<BR>
You, far aloof from your forsaken bands,<BR>
Your rolling chariot drive o'er empty</P>
<P>Stupid he sate, his eyes on earth declin'd,<BR>
And various cares revolving in his mind:<BR>
Rage, boiling from the bottom of his breast,<BR>
And sorrow mix'd with shame, his soul oppress'd;<BR>
And conscious worth lay lab'ring in his thought,<BR>
And love by jealousy to madness wrought.<BR>
By slow degrees his reason drove away<BR>
The mists of passion, and resum'd her sway.<BR>
Then, rising on his car, he turn'd his look,<BR>
And saw the town involv'd in fire and smoke.<BR>
A wooden tow'r with flames already blaz'd,<BR>
Which his own hands on beams and rafters rais'd;<BR>
And bridges laid above to join the space,<BR>
And wheels below to roll from place to place.<BR>
"Sister, the Fates have vanquish'd: let us go<BR>
The way which Heav'n and my hard fortune show.<BR>
The fight is fix'd; nor shall the branded name<BR>
Of a base coward blot your brother's fame.<BR>
Death is my choice; but suffer me to try<BR>
My force, and vent my rage before I die."<BR>
He said; and, leaping down without delay,<BR>
Thro' crowds of scatter'd foes he freed his way.<BR>
Striding he pass'd, impetuous as the wind,<BR>
And left the grieving goddess far behind.<BR>
As when a fragment, from a mountain torn<BR>
By raging tempests, or by torrents borne,<BR>
Or sapp'd by time, or loosen'd from the roots-<BR>
Prone thro' the void the rocky ruin shoots,<BR>
Rolling from crag to crag, from steep to steep;<BR>
Down sink, at once, the shepherds and their sheep:<BR>
Involv'd alike, they rush to nether ground;<BR>
Stunn'd with the shock they fall, and stunn'd from earth rebound:<BR>
So Turnus, hasting headlong to the town,<BR>
Should'ring and shoving, bore the squadrons down.<BR>
Still pressing onward, to the walls he drew,<BR>
Where shafts, and spears, and darts promiscuous flew,<BR>
And sanguine streams the slipp'ry ground embrue.<BR>
First stretching out his arm, in sign of peace,<BR>
He cries aloud, to make the combat cease:<BR>
"Rutulians, hold; and Latin troops, retire!<BR>
The fight is mine; and me the gods require.<BR>
'T is just that I should vindicate alone<BR>
The broken truce, or for the breach atone.<BR>
This day shall free from wars th' Ausonian state,<BR>
Or finish my misfortunes in my fate."</P>
<P>Both armies from their bloody work desist,<BR>
And, bearing backward, form a spacious list.<BR>
The Trojan hero, who receiv'd from fame<BR>
The welcome sound, and heard the champion's name,<BR>
Soon leaves the taken works and mounted walls,<BR>
Greedy of war where greater glory calls.<BR>
He springs to fight, exulting in his force<BR>
His jointed armor rattles in the course.<BR>
Like Eryx, or like Athos, great he shows,<BR>
Or Father Apennine, when, white with snows,<BR>
His head divine obscure in clouds he hides,<BR>
And shakes the sounding forest on his sides.<BR>
The nations, overaw'd, surcease the fight;<BR>
Immovable their bodies, fix'd their sight.<BR>
Ev'n death stands still; nor from above they throw<BR>
Their darts, nor drive their batt'ring-rams below.<BR>
In silent order either army stands,<BR>
And drop their swords, unknowing, from their hands.<BR>
Th' Ausonian king beholds, with wond'ring sight,<BR>
Two mighty champions match'd in single fight,<BR>
Born under climes remote, and brought by fate,<BR>
With swords to try their titles to the state.</P>
<P>Now, in clos'd field, each other from afar<BR>
They view; and, rushing on, begin the war.<BR>
They launch their spears; then hand to hand they meet;<BR>
The trembling soil resounds beneath their feet:<BR>
Their bucklers clash; thick blows descend from high,<BR>
And flakes of fire from their hard helmets fly.<BR>
Courage conspires with chance, and both ingage<BR>
With equal fortune yet, and mutual rage.<BR>
As when two bulls for their fair female fight<BR>
In Sila's shades, or on Taburnus' height;<BR>
With horns adverse they meet; the keeper flies;<BR>
Mute stands the herd; the heifers roll their eyes,<BR>
And wait th' event; which victor they shall bear,<BR>
And who shall be the lord, to rule the lusty year:<BR>
With rage of love the jealous rivals burn,<BR>
And push for push, and wound for wound return;<BR>
Their dewlaps gor'd, their sides are lav'd in blood;<BR>
Loud cries and roaring sounds rebellow thro' the wood:<BR>
Such was the combat in the listed ground;<BR>
So clash their swords, and so their shields resound.</P>
<P>Jove sets the beam; in either scale he lays<BR>
The champions' fate, and each exactly weighs.<BR>
On this side, life and lucky chance ascends;<BR>
Loaded with death, that other scale descends.<BR>
Rais'd on the stretch, young Turnus aims a blow<BR>
Full on the helm of his unguarded foe:<BR>
Shrill shouts and clamors ring on either side,<BR>
As hopes and fears their panting hearts divide.<BR>
But all in pieces flies the traitor sword,<BR>
And, in the middle stroke, deserts his lord.<BR>
Now is but death, or flight; disarm'd he flies,<BR>
When in his hand an unknown hilt he spies.<BR>
Fame says that Turnus, when his steeds he join'd,<BR>
Hurrying to war, disorder'd in his mind,<BR>
Snatch'd the first weapon which his haste could find.<BR>
'T was not the fated sword his father bore,<BR>
But that his charioteer Metiscus wore.<BR>
This, while the Trojans fled, the toughness held;<BR>
But, vain against the great Vulcanian shield,<BR>
The mortal-temper'd steel deceiv'd his hand:<BR>
The shiver'd fragments shone amid the sand.</P>
<P>Surpris'd with fear, he fled along the field,<BR>
And now forthright, and now in orbits wheel'd;<BR>
For here the Trojan troops the list surround,<BR>
And there the pass is clos'd with pools and marshy ground.<BR>
Aeneas hastens, tho' with heavier pace-<BR>
His wound, so newly knit, retards the chase,<BR>
And oft his trembling knees their aid refuse-<BR>
Yet, pressing foot by foot, his foe pursues.</P>
<P>Thus, when a fearful stag is clos'd around<BR>
With crimson toils, or in a river found,<BR>
High on the bank the deep-mouth'd hound appears,<BR>
Still opening, following still, where'er he steers;<BR>
The persecuted creature, to and fro,<BR>
Turns here and there, to scape his Umbrian foe:<BR>
Steep is th' ascent, and, if he gains the land,<BR>
The purple death is pitch'd along the strand.<BR>
His eager foe, determin'd to the chase,<BR>
Stretch'd at his length, gains ground at ev'ry pace;<BR>
Now to his beamy head he makes his way,<BR>
And now he holds, or thinks he holds, his prey:<BR>
Just at the pinch, the stag springs out with fear;<BR>
He bites the wind, and fills his sounding jaws with air:<BR>
The rocks, the lakes, the meadows ring with cries;<BR>
The mortal tumult mounts, and thunders in the skies.<BR>
Thus flies the Daunian prince, and, flying, blames<BR>
His tardy troops, and, calling by their names,<BR>
Demands his trusty sword. The Trojan threats<BR>
The realm with ruin, and their ancient seats<BR>
To lay in ashes, if they dare supply<BR>
With arms or aid his vanquish'd enemy:<BR>
Thus menacing, he still pursues the course,<BR>
With vigor, tho' diminish'd of his force.<BR>
Ten times already round the listed place<BR>
One chief had fled, and t' other giv'n the chase:<BR>
No trivial prize is play'd; for on the life<BR>
Or death of Turnus now depends the strife.</P>
<P>Within the space, an olive tree had stood,<BR>
A sacred shade, a venerable wood,<BR>
For vows to Faunus paid, the Latins' guardian god.<BR>
Here hung the vests, and tablets were ingrav'd,<BR>
Of sinking mariners from shipwrack sav'd.<BR>
With heedless hands the Trojans fell'd the tree,<BR>
To make the ground inclos'd for combat free.<BR>
Deep in the root, whether by fate, or chance,<BR>
Or erring haste, the Trojan drove his lance;<BR>
Then stoop'd, and tugg'd with force immense, to free<BR>
Th' incumber'd spear from the tenacious tree;<BR>
That, whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain,<BR>
His flying weapon might from far attain.</P>
<P>Confus'd with fear, bereft of human aid,<BR>
Then Turnus to the gods, and first to Faunus pray'd:<BR>
"O Faunus, pity! and thou Mother Earth,<BR>
Where I thy foster son receiv'd my birth,<BR>
Hold fast the steel! If my religious hand<BR>
Your plant has honor'd, which your foes profan'd,<BR>
Propitious hear my pious pray'r!" He said,<BR>
Nor with successless vows invok'd their aid.<BR>
Th' incumbent hero wrench'd, and pull'd, and strain'd;<BR>
But still the stubborn earth the steel detain'd.<BR>
Juturna took her time; and, while in vain<BR>
He strove, assum'd Meticus' form again,<BR>
And, in that imitated shape, restor'd<BR>
To the despairing prince his Daunian sword.<BR>
The Queen of Love, who, with disdain and grief,<BR>
Saw the bold nymph afford this prompt relief,<BR>
T' assert her offspring with a greater deed,<BR>
From the tough root the ling'ring weapon freed.</P>
<P>Once more erect, the rival chiefs advance:<BR>
One trusts the sword, and one the pointed lance;<BR>
And both resolv'd alike to try their fatal chance.</P>
<P>Meantime imperial Jove to Juno spoke,<BR>
Who from a shining cloud beheld the shock:<BR>
"What new arrest, O Queen of Heav'n, is sent<BR>
To stop the Fates now lab'ring in th' event?<BR>
What farther hopes are left thee to pursue?<BR>
Divine Aeneas, (and thou know'st it too,)<BR>
Foredoom'd, to these celestial seats are due.<BR>
What more attempts for Turnus can be made,<BR>
That thus thou ling'rest in this lonely shade?<BR>
Is it becoming of the due respect<BR>
And awful honor of a god elect,<BR>
A wound unworthy of our state to feel,<BR>
Patient of human hands and earthly steel?<BR>
Or seems it just, the sister should restore<BR>
A second sword, when one was lost before,<BR>
And arm a conquer'd wretch against his conqueror?<BR>
For what, without thy knowledge and avow,<BR>
Nay more, thy dictate, durst Juturna do?<BR>
At last, in deference to my love, forbear<BR>
To lodge within thy soul this anxious care;<BR>
Reclin'd upon my breast, thy grief unload:<BR>
Who should relieve the goddess, but the god?<BR>
Now all things to their utmost issue tend,<BR>
Push'd by the Fates to their appointed<BR>
While leave was giv'n thee, and a lawful hour<BR>
For vengeance, wrath, and unresisted pow'r,<BR>
Toss'd on the seas, thou couldst thy foes distress,<BR>
And, driv'n ashore, with hostile arms oppress;<BR>
Deform the royal house; and, from the side<BR>
Of the just bridegroom, tear the plighted bride:<BR>
Now cease at my command." The Thund'rer said;<BR>
And, with dejected eyes, this answer Juno made:<BR>
"Because your dread decree too well I knew,<BR>
From Turnus and from earth unwilling I withdrew.<BR>
Else should you not behold me here, alone,<BR>
Involv'd in empty clouds, my friends bemoan,<BR>
But, girt with vengeful flames, in open sight<BR>
Engag'd against my foes in mortal fight.<BR>
'T is true, Juturna mingled in the strife<BR>
By my command, to save her brother's life-<BR>
At least to try; but, by the Stygian lake,<BR>
(The most religious oath the gods can take,)<BR>
With this restriction, not to bend the bow,<BR>
Or toss the spear, or trembling dart to throw.<BR>
And now, resign'd to your superior might,<BR>
And tir'd with fruitless toils, I loathe the fight.<BR>
This let me beg (and this no fates withstand)<BR>
Both for myself and for your father's land,<BR>
That, when the nuptial bed shall bind the peace,<BR>
(Which I, since you ordain, consent to bless,)<BR>
The laws of either nation be the same;<BR>
But let the Latins still retain their name,<BR>
Speak the same language which they spoke before,<BR>
Wear the same habits which their grandsires wore.<BR>
Call them not Trojans: perish the renown<BR>
And name of Troy, with that detested town.<BR>
Latium be Latium still; let Alba reign<BR>
And Rome's immortal majesty remain."</P>
<P>Then thus the founder of mankind replies<BR>
(Unruffled was his front, serene his eyes)<BR>
"Can Saturn's issue, and heav'n's other heir,<BR>
Such endless anger in her bosom bear?<BR>
Be mistress, and your full desires obtain;<BR>
But quench the choler you foment in vain.<BR>
From ancient blood th' Ausonian people sprung,<BR>
Shall keep their name, their habit, and their tongue.<BR>
The Trojans to their customs shall be tied:<BR>
I will, myself, their common rites provide;<BR>
The natives shall command, the foreigners subside.<BR>
All shall be Latium; Troy without a name;<BR>
And her lost sons forget from whence they came.<BR>
From blood so mix'd, a pious race shall flow,<BR>
Equal to gods, excelling all below.<BR>
No nation more respect to you shall pay,<BR>
Or greater off'rings on your altars lay."<BR>
Juno consents, well pleas'd that her desires<BR>
Had found success, and from the cloud retires.</P>
<P>The peace thus made, the Thund'rer next prepares<BR>
To force the wat'ry goddess from the wars.<BR>
Deep in the dismal regions void of light,<BR>
Three daughters at a birth were born to Night:<BR>
These their brown mother, brooding on her care,<BR>
Indued with windy wings to flit in air,<BR>
With serpents girt alike, and crown'd with hissing hair.<BR>
In heav'n the Dirae call'd, and still at hand,<BR>
Before the throne of angry Jove they stand,<BR>
His ministers of wrath, and ready still<BR>
The minds of mortal men with fears to fill,<BR>
Whene'er the moody sire, to wreak his hate<BR>
On realms or towns deserving of their fate,<BR>
Hurls down diseases, death and deadly care,<BR>
And terrifies the guilty world with war.<BR>
One sister plague if these from heav'n he sent,<BR>
To fright Juturna with a dire portent.<BR>
The pest comes whirling down: by far more slow<BR>
Springs the swift arrow from the Parthian bow,<BR>
Or Cydon yew, when, traversing the skies,<BR>
And drench'd in pois'nous juice, the sure destruction flies.<BR>
With such a sudden and unseen a flight<BR>
Shot thro' the clouds the daughter of the night.<BR>
Soon as the field inclos'd she had in view,<BR>
And from afar her destin'd quarry knew,<BR>
Contracted, to the boding bird she turns,<BR>
Which haunts the ruin'd piles and hallow'd urns,<BR>
And beats about the tombs with nightly wings,<BR>
Where songs obscene on sepulchers she sings.<BR>
Thus lessen'd in her form, with frightful cries<BR>
The Fury round unhappy Turnus flies,<BR>
Flaps on his shield, and flutters o'er his eyes.</P>
<P>A lazy chillness crept along his blood;<BR>
Chok'd was his voice; his hair with horror stood.<BR>
Juturna from afar beheld her fly,<BR>
And knew th' ill omen, by her screaming cry<BR>
And stridor of her wings. Amaz'd with fear,<BR>
Her beauteous breast she beat, and rent her flowing hair.</P>
<P>"Ah me!" she cries, "in this unequal strife<BR>
What can thy sister more to save thy life?<BR>
Weak as I am, can I, alas! contend<BR>
In arms with that inexorable fiend?<BR>
Now, now, I quit the field! forbear to fright<BR>
My tender soul, ye baleful birds of night;<BR>
The lashing of your wings I know too well,<BR>
The sounding flight, and fun'ral screams of hell!<BR>
These are the gifts you bring from haughty Jove,<BR>
The worthy recompense of ravish'd love!<BR>
Did he for this exempt my life from fate?<BR>
O hard conditions of immortal state,<BR>
Tho' born to death, not privileg'd to die,<BR>
But forc'd to bear impos'd eternity!<BR>
Take back your envious bribes, and let me go<BR>
Companion to my brother's ghost below!<BR>
The joys are vanish'd: nothing now remains,<BR>
Of life immortal, but immortal pains.<BR>
What earth will open her devouring womb,<BR>
To rest a weary goddess in the tomb!"<BR>
She drew a length of sighs; nor more she said,<BR>
But in her azure mantle wrapp'd her head,<BR>
Then plung'd into her stream, with deep despair,<BR>
And her last sobs came bubbling up in air.</P>
<P>Now stern Aeneas his weighty spear<BR>
Against his foe, and thus upbraids his fear:<BR>
"What farther subterfuge can Turnus find?<BR>
What empty hopes are harbor'd in his mind?<BR>
'T is not thy swiftness can secure thy flight;<BR>
Not with their feet, but hands, the valiant fight.<BR>
Vary thy shape in thousand forms, and dare<BR>
What skill and courage can attempt in war;<BR>
Wish for the wings of winds, to mount the sky;<BR>
Or hid, within the hollow earth to lie!"<BR>
The champion shook his head, and made this short reply:<BR>
"No threats of thine my manly mind can move;<BR>
'T is hostile heav'n I dread, and partial Jove."<BR>
He said no more, but, with a sigh, repress'd<BR>
The mighty sorrow in his swelling breast.</P>
<P>Then, as he roll'd his troubled eyes around,<BR>
An antique stone he saw, the common bound<BR>
Of neighb'ring fields, and barrier of the ground;<BR>
So vast, that twelve strong men of modern days<BR>
Th' enormous weight from earth could hardly raise.<BR>
He heav'd it at a lift, and, pois'd on high,<BR>
Ran stagg'ring on against his enemy,<BR>
But so disorder'd, that he scarcely knew<BR>
His way, or what unwieldly weight he threw.<BR>
His knocking knees are bent beneath the load,<BR>
And shiv'ring cold congeals his vital blood.<BR>
The stone drops from his arms, and, falling short<BR>
For want of vigor, mocks his vain effort.<BR>
And as, when heavy sleep has clos'd the sight,<BR>
The sickly fancy labors in the night;<BR>
We seem to run; and, destitute of force,<BR>
Our sinking limbs forsake us in the course:<BR>
In vain we heave for breath; in vain we cry;<BR>
The nerves, unbrac'd, their usual strength deny;<BR>
And on the tongue the falt'ring accents die:<BR>
So Turnus far'd; whatever means he tried,<BR>
All force of arms and points of art employ'd,<BR>
The Fury flew athwart, and made th' endeavor void.</P>
<P>A thousand various thoughts his soul confound;<BR>
He star'd about, nor aid nor issue found;<BR>
His own men stop the pass, and his own walls surround.<BR>
Once more he pauses, and looks out again,<BR>
And seeks the goddess charioteer in vain.<BR>
Trembling he views the thund'ring chief advance,<BR>
And brandishing aloft the deadly lance:<BR>
Amaz'd he cow'rs beneath his conqu'ring foe,<BR>
Forgets to ward, and waits the coming blow.<BR>
Astonish'd while he stands, and fix'd with fear,<BR>
Aim'd at his shield he sees th' impending spear.</P>
<P>The hero measur'd first, with narrow view,<BR>
The destin'd mark; and, rising as he threw,<BR>
With its full swing the fatal weapon flew.<BR>
Not with less rage the rattling thunder falls,<BR>
Or stones from batt'ring-engines break the walls:<BR>
Swift as a whirlwind, from an arm so strong,<BR>
The lance drove on, and bore the death along.<BR>
Naught could his sev'nfold shield the prince avail,<BR>
Nor aught, beneath his arms, the coat of mail:<BR>
It pierc'd thro' all, and with a grisly wound<BR>
Transfix'd his thigh, and doubled him to ground.<BR>
With groans the Latins rend the vaulted sky:<BR>
Woods, hills, and valleys, to the voice reply.</P>
<P>Now low on earth the lofty chief is laid,<BR>
With eyes cast upward, and with arms display'd,<BR>
And, recreant, thus to the proud victor pray'd:<BR>
"I know my death deserv'd, nor hope to live:<BR>
Use what the gods and thy good fortune give.<BR>
Yet think, O think, if mercy may be shown-<BR>
Thou hadst a father once, and hast a son-<BR>
Pity my sire, now sinking to the grave;<BR>
And for Anchises' sake old Daunus save!<BR>
Or, if thy vow'd revenge pursue my death,<BR>
Give to my friends my body void of breath!<BR>
The Latian chiefs have seen me beg my life;<BR>
Thine is the conquest, thine the royal wife:<BR>
Against a yielded man, 't is mean ignoble strife."</P>
<P>In deep suspense the Trojan seem'd to stand,<BR>
And, just prepar'd to strike, repress'd his hand.<BR>
He roll'd his eyes, and ev'ry moment felt<BR>
His manly soul with more compassion melt;<BR>
When, casting down a casual glance, he spied<BR>
The golden belt that glitter'd on his side,<BR>
The fatal spoils which haughty Turnus tore<BR>
From dying Pallas, and in triumph wore.<BR>
Then, rous'd anew to wrath, he loudly cries<BR>
(Flames, while he spoke, came flashing from his eyes)<BR>
"Traitor, dost thou, dost thou to grace pretend,<BR>
Clad, as thou art, in trophies of my friend?<BR>
To his sad soul a grateful off'ring go!<BR>
'T is Pallas, Pallas gives this deadly blow."<BR>
He rais'd his arm aloft, and, at the word,<BR>
Deep in his bosom drove the shining sword.<BR>
The streaming blood distain'd his arms around,<BR>
And the disdainful soul came rushing thro' the wound.</P></BODY>
