### TO THE CLOUDS.

###### The FUMIGATION from MYRRH.

Ærial clouds, thro' heav'n's resplendent plains  
Who wander, parents of prolific rains;  
Who nourish fruits, whose water'y frames are hurl'd,  
By winds impetuous, round the mighty world;  
All-thund'ring, lion-roaring, flashing fire, 5  
In Air's wide bosom, bearing thunders dire  
Impell'd by ev'ry stormy, sounding gale,  
With rapid course, along the skies ye fail.  
With blowing winds your wat'ry frames I call,  
On mother Earth with fruitful show'rs to fall.
