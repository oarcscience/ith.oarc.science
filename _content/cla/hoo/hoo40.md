###### XXXV.

### TO DIANA.

###### The FUMIGATION from MANNA.

Hear me, Jove's daughter, celebrated queen,  
Bacchian and Titan, of a noble mien:

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

In darts rejoicing and on all to shine,  
Torch-bearing Goddess, Dictynna divine;  
O'er births presiding, and thyself a maid, 5  <span
id="fr_97"></span>[5](#fn_97)  
To labour-pangs imparting ready aid:  
Dissolver of the zone and wrinkl'd care,  
Fierce huntress, glorying in the Sylvan war:  
Swift in the course, in dreadful arrows skill'd,  
Wandering by night, [rejoicing](errata.htm#7) in the field: 10  
Of manly form, erect, of bounteous mind,  
Illustrious dæmon, nurse of human kind:  
Immortal, earthly, bane of monsters fell,  
'Tis thine; blest maid, on woody hills to dwell:  
Foe of the stag, whom woods and dogs delight, 15  
In endless youth who flourish fair and bright.  
O, universal queen, august, divine,  
A various form, Cydonian pow'r, is thine:  
Dread guardian Goddess, with benignant mind  
Auspicious, come to mystic rites inclin'd 20  
Give earth a store of beauteous fruits to bear,  
Send gentle Peace, and Health with lovely hair,  
And to the mountains drive Disease and Care.
