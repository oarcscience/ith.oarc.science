###### LXII.

### TO EQUITY.

###### The FUMIGATION from FRANKINCENSE.

O Blessed Equity, mankind's delight,  
Th' eternal friend of conduct just and right:  
Abundant, venerable, honor'd maid,  
To judgments pure, dispensing constant aid,

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

A stable conscience, and an upright mind;  
For men unjust, by thee are undermin'd,  
Whose souls perverse thy bondage ne'er desire,  
But more untam'd decline thy scourges dire:  
Harmonious, friendly power, averse to strife,  
In peace rejoicing, and a stable life; 10  
Lovely, loquacious, of a gentle mind,  
Hating excess, to equal deeds inclin'd:  
Wisdom, and virtue of whate'er degree,  
Receive their proper bound alone in thee.  
Hear, Goddess Equity, the deeds destroy 15  
Of evil men, which human life annoy;  
That all may yield to thee of mortal birth,  
Whether supported by the fruits of earth,  
Or in her kindly fertile bosom found,  
or in the depths of Marine Jove profound. 20
