###### VI.

### TO THE STARS.

###### The FUMIGATION from AROMATICS.

WITH holy voice I call the stars on high,  
Pure sacred lights and genii of the sky.  
Celestial stars, the progeny of Night,  
In whirling circles beaming far your light,  
Refulgent rays around the heav'ns ye throw, 5  
Eternal fires, the source of all below.  
With flames significant of Fate ye shine,  
And aptly rule for men a path divine.  
In seven bright zones ye run with wand'ring flames,  
And heaven and earth compose your lucid frames: 10  <span

With course unwearied, pure and fiery bright  
Forever shining thro' the veil of Night.  
Hail twinkling, joyful, ever wakeful fires!  
Propitious shine on all my just desires;

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

These sacred rites regard with conscious rays, 15  
And end our works devoted to your praise.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[121:10](hoo11.htm#fr_52) Ver. 10.\] *And heaven
and earth*, &c. It is an Orphic and Pythagoric opinion that the stars
are inhabited; on which account they are called in this hymn, earthly.
But the greatest geniuses of antiquity were of the same opinion; such as
Anaxagoras, Aristarchus, Heraclitus, Plato, &c. and among the Platonists
not a few, as Alcinous, Plotinus, and Plutarch. Thales too is said to
have called the stars earthly, by which it is probable he was of the
same opinion.
