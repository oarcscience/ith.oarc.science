###### LXIII.

### TO LAW

###### A HYMN.

THE holy king of Gods and men I call,  
Celestial Law, the righteous seal of all;  
The seal which stamps whate'er the earth contains,  
Nature's firm basis, and the liquid plains:  
Stable, and starry, of harmonious frame, 5  
Preserving laws eternally the same:

Thy all-composing pow'r in heaven appears,  
Connects its frame, and props the starry spheres;  
And shakes weak Envy with tremendous sound,  
Toss'd by thy arm in giddy whirls around. 10  
'Tis thine, the life of mortals to defend,  
And crown existence with a blessed end;  
For thy command and alone, of all that lives  
Order and rule to ev'ry dwelling gives:  
Ever observant of the upright mind, 15  
And of just actions the companion kind;  
Foe to the lawless, with avenging ire,  
Their steps involving in destruction dire.  
Come, bless, abundant pow'r, whom all revere,  
By all desir'd, with favr'ing mind draw near; 20  
Give me thro' life, on thee to fix my fight,  
And ne'er forsake the equal paths of right.
