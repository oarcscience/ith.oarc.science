###### II.

### TO NIGHT.

###### The FUMIGATION with TORCHES.

NIGHT, parent goddess, source of sweet repose,  
From whom at first both Gods and men arose,  
Hear, blessed Venus, deck'd with starry light, <span
id="fr_46"></span>[3](#fn_46)  
In sleep's deep silence dwelling Ebon night!  
Dreams and soft case attend thy dusky train, 5  
Pleas'd with the length'ned gloom and **feaftful** strain.

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

Dissolving anxious care, the friend of Mirth,  
With darkling coursers riding round the earth.  
Goddess of phantoms and of shadowy play,  
Whose drowsy pow'r divides the nat'ral day: 10  
By Fate's decree you constant send the light  
To deepest hell, remote from mortal sight  
For dire Necessity which nought withstands,  
Invests the world with adamantine bands.  
Be present, Goddess, to thy suppliant's pray'r, 15  
Desir'd by all, whom all alike revere,  
Blessed, benevolent, with friendly aid  
Dispell the fears of Twilight's dreadful shade.
