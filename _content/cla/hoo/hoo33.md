###### XXVIII.

### TO PROSERPINE.

###### A HYMN

DAUGHTER of Jove, almighty and divine,  
Come, blessed queen, and to these rites incline:  
Only-begotten, Pluto's honor'd wife,  <span
id="fr_83"></span>[3](#fn_83)  
O venerable Goddess, source of life:  
'Tis thine in earth's profundities to dwell, 5  
Fast by the wide and dismal gates of hell:  
Jove's holy offspring, of a beauteous mien,  
Fatal, with lovely locks, infernal queen:  
Source of the furies, whose blest frame proceeds  
From Jove's ineffable and secret seeds: 10  
Mother of Bacchus, Sonorous, divine,  
And many-form'd, the parent of the vine:  
The dancing Hours attend thee, essence bright,  
All-ruling virgin, bearing heav'nly light:

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

Illustrious, horned, of a bounteous mind, 13  
Alone desir'd by those of mortal kind.  
O, vernal queen, whom grassy plains delight,  
Sweet to the smell, and pleasing to the sight:  
Whose holy form in budding fruits we view,  
Earth's vig'rous offspring of a various hue: 20  
Espous'd in Autumn: life and death alone  <span
id="fr_84"></span>[21](#fn_84)  
To wretched mortals from thy power is known:  
For thine the task according to thy will,  <span
id="fr_85"></span>[23](#fn_85)  
Life to produce, and all that lives to kill.

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

Hear, blessed Goddess, send a rich increase 25  
Of various fruits from earth, with lovely Peace;  
Send Health with gentle hand, and crown my life  
With blest abundance, free from noisy strife;  
Last in extreme old age the prey of Death,  
Dismiss we willing to the realms beneath, 30  
To thy fair palace, and the blissful plains  
Where happy spirits dwell, and Pluto reigns.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[153:3](hoo33.htm#fr_83) Ver. 3\]
*Only-begotten*. Καὶ γὰρ ὁ Θεολογός την κόρην ΜΟΥΝΟ-ΓΕΝΕΙΑΝ ἔιαθε
προσαγορεύειν. Proc. Tim. 2 extra p. 139. 9. i.e. "I see that the
theologist (meaning Orpheus) calls Proserpine, "Only-begotten".

<span id="fn_84"></span>[154:21](hoo33.htm#fr_84) Ver. 21.\] *Espous'd
in Autumn*. We have already observed in the Dissertation, that the
Orphic theologers considered a difference of sex in the divinities;
attributing the male to some, and the female to others. Now the mutual
commerce and energy subsisting between these Gods and Goddesses, they
denominated Ιεροι Γαμοι, i. e. "holy marriages:" or according to
Proclus, on the Parmenides of Plato, as cited by Eschenbach, in Epig. p.
59. they mystically called, the simple kindred conjunction, and
communion of divine causes, a marriage. And Proserpine, or the animating
part of the earth's soul, may he considered as resting in Autumn, from
all farther productions; her powers at that time having attained their
full perfection.

Hence at this period may we not say, that she is wholly abstracted from
the animal life, and secretly united with Pluto, or the intellectual
part of the earth's soul; from whom she receives the divine light of
mind, and copious streams of the nectar of divine knowledge.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[154:23](hoo33.htm#fr_85) Ver. 23.\] *For thine
the task*, &c. Proclus, in Theol. Plat. p. 371, informs us, that,
according to the Eleusinian mysteries, Proserpine together with Pluto,
governs terrestrial concerns, and the recesses of the earth: that she
supplies life to the extreme <span id="page_155">p. 155</span> parts of
the universe, and imparts soul to those, who, by her power, are rendered
inanimate and dead. This is perfectly agreeable to the 23d and following
line.
