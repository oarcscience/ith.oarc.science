<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">TO PROSERPINE.</H3>
<H6 ALIGN="CENTER">A HYMN</H6>
<P>DAUGHTER of Jove, almighty and divine,<BR>
Come, blessed queen, and to these rites incline:<BR>
Only-begotten, Pluto's honor'd wife, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_83"></A><A HREF="#fn_83"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><BR>
O venerable Goddess, source of life:<BR>
'Tis thine in earth's profundities to dwell, 5<BR>
Fast by the wide and dismal gates of hell:<BR>
Jove's holy offspring, of a beauteous mien,<BR>
Fatal, with lovely locks, infernal queen:<BR>
Source of the furies, whose blest frame proceeds<BR>
From Jove's ineffable and secret seeds: 10<BR>
Mother of Bacchus, Sonorous, divine,<BR>
And many-form'd, the parent of the vine:<BR>
The dancing Hours attend thee, essence bright,<BR>
All-ruling virgin, bearing heav'nly light:</P>
<P><A NAME="page_154"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 154</FONT></A></P>
<P>Illustrious, horned, of a bounteous mind, 13<BR>
Alone desir'd by those of mortal kind.<BR>
O, vernal queen, whom grassy plains delight,<BR>
Sweet to the smell, and pleasing to the sight:<BR>
Whose holy form in budding fruits we view,<BR>
Earth's vig'rous offspring of a various hue: 20<BR>
Espous'd in Autumn: life and death alone &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A><BR>
To wretched mortals from thy power is known:<BR>
For thine the task according to thy will, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_85"></A><A HREF="#fn_85"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A><BR>
Life to produce, and all that lives to kill.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_155"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 155</FONT></A></P>
<P>Hear, blessed Goddess, send a rich increase 25<BR>
Of various fruits from earth, with lovely Peace;<BR>
Send Health with gentle hand, and crown my life<BR>
With blest abundance, free from noisy strife;<BR>
Last in extreme old age the prey of Death,<BR>
Dismiss we willing to the realms beneath, 30<BR>
To thy fair palace, and the blissful plains<BR>
Where happy spirits dwell, and Pluto reigns.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_84"></A><A HREF="hoo33.htm#fr_84">154:21</A> Ver. 21.] <I>Espous'd in Autumn</I>. We have already observed in the Dissertation, that the Orphic theologers considered a difference of sex in the divinities; attributing the male to some, and the female to others. Now the mutual commerce and energy subsisting between these Gods and Goddesses, they denominated &#0921&#0949&#0961&#0959&#0953 &#0915&#0945&#0956&#0959&#0953, i. e. "holy marriages:" or according to Proclus, on the Parmenides of Plato, as cited by Eschenbach, in Epig. p. 59. they mystically called, the simple kindred conjunction, and communion of divine causes, a marriage. And Proserpine, or the animating part of the earth's soul, may he considered as resting in Autumn, from all farther productions; her powers at that time having attained their full perfection.</P>
<P>Hence at this period may we not say, that she is wholly abstracted from the animal life, and secretly united with Pluto, or the intellectual part of the earth's soul; from whom she receives the divine light of mind, and copious streams of the nectar of divine knowledge.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_85"></A><A HREF="hoo33.htm#fr_85">154:23</A> Ver. 23.] <I>For thine the task</I>, &amp;c. Proclus, in Theol. Plat. p. 371, informs us, that, according to the Eleusinian mysteries, Proserpine together with Pluto, governs terrestrial concerns, and the recesses of the earth: that she supplies life to the extreme <A NAME="page_155"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 155</FONT></A> parts of the universe, and imparts soul to those, who, by her power, are rendered inanimate and dead. This is perfectly agreeable to the 23d and following line.</P>
