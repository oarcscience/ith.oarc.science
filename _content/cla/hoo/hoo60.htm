<P>MUCH-nam'd, and best of d&aelig;mons, hear my pray'r,<BR>
The desart-loving, deck'd with tender hair;<BR>
Joy to diffuse, by all desir'd is thine,<BR>
Much form'd, Eubulus; aliment divine</P>

<P>Female and Male, all charming to the sight, 5<BR>
Adonis ever flourishing and bright;<BR>
At stated periods doom'd to set and rise,<BR>
With splendid lamp, the glory of the skies. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A><BR>
Two-horn'd and lovely, reverenc'd with tears,<BR>
Of beauteous form, adorn'd with copious hairs. 10<BR>
Rejoicing in the chace, all-graceful pow'r,<BR>
Sweet plant of Venus, Love's delightful flow'r:<BR>
Descended from the secret bed divine,<BR>
Of lovely-hair'd, infernal Proserpine.<BR>
'Tis thine to fink in Tartarus profound, 15<BR>
And shine again thro' heav'ns illustrious round,<BR>
With beauteous temp'ral orb restor'd to sight;<BR>
Come, with earth's fruits, and in these flames delight.</P>
