<P>NYMPHS, who from Ocean's stream derive your birth,<BR>
Who dwell in liquid caverns of the earth</P>
<P><A NAME="page_182"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 182</FONT></A></P>
<P>Nurses of Bacchus secret-coursing pow'r,<BR>
Who fruits sustain, and nourish ev'ry flow'r:<BR>
Earthly, rejoicing, who in meadows dwell, 5<BR>
And caves and dens, whose depths extend to hell:<BR>
Holy, oblique, who swiftly soar thro' air,<BR>
Fountains and dews, and mazy streams your care:<BR>
Seen and unseen, who joy with wand'rings wide<BR>
And gentle course, thro' flow'ry vales to glide; 10<BR>
With Pan exulting on the mountains height,<BR>
Loud-founding, mad, whom rocks and woods delight:<BR>
Nymphs od'rous, rob'd in white, whose streams exhale<BR>
The breeze refreshing, and the balmy gale;<BR>
With goats and pastures pleas'd, and beasts of prey, 15<BR>
Nurses of fruits, unconscious of decay:<BR>
In cold rejoicing, and to cattle kind,<BR>
Sportive thro' ocean wand'ring unconfin'd:<BR>
Nysian, fanatic Nymphs, whom oaks delight,<BR>
Lovers of Spring, P&aelig;onian virgins bright. 20<BR>
With Bacchus, and with Ceres, hear my pray'r.<BR>
And to mankind abundant favour bear;<BR>
Propitious listen to your suppliants voice,<BR>
Come, and benignant in these rites rejoice;<BR>
Give plenteous Seasons, and sufficient wealth, 25<BR>
And pour; in lasting streams, continued Health.</P>
