<P>Brass-beating Salians, ministers of Mars,<BR>
Who guard his arms the instruments of wars</P>
<P><A NAME="page_168"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 168</FONT></A></P>
<P>Whose blessed frames, heav'n, earth, and sea compose,<BR>
And from whose breath all animals arose:<BR>
Who dwell in Samothracia's sacred ground, 5<BR>
Defending mortals thro' the sea profound.<BR>
Deathless Curetes, by your pow'r alone,<BR>
Initial rites to men at first were shewn:<BR>
Who shake old Ocean thund'ring to the sky,<BR>
And stubborn oaks with branches waving high. 10<BR>
'Tis your's in glittering arms the earth to beat,<BR>
With lightly-leaping, rapid, sounding feet;<BR>
Then every beast the noise terrific flies,<BR>
And the loud tumult wanders thro' the skies:<BR>
The dust your feet excites with matchless force, 15<BR>
Flies to the clouds amidst their whirling course;<BR>
And ev'ry flower of variegated hue,<BR>
Grows in the dancing motion form'd by you.<BR>
Immortal d&aelig;mons, to your pow'rs consign'd<BR>
The talk to nourish, and destroy mankind. 20</P>
<P><A NAME="page_169"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 169</FONT></A></P>
<P>When rushing furious with loud tumult dire,<BR>
O'erwhelm'd, they perish in your dreadful ire;<BR>
And live replenish'd with the balmy air,<BR>
The food of life, committed to your care.<BR>
When shook by you, the seas, with wild uproar, 25<BR>
Wide-spreading, and profoundly whirling, roar:<BR>
The concave heav'ns, with Echo's voice resound,<BR>
When leaves with ruffling noise bestrew the ground.<BR>
Curetes, Corybantes, ruling kings,<BR>
Whose praise the land of Samothracia sings: 30<BR>
From Jove descended; whose immortal breath<BR>
Sustains the soul, and wafts her back from death;<BR>
Aerial-form'd, much-fam'd, in heav'n ye shine<BR>
Two-fold, in heav'n all-lucid and divine:<BR>
Blowing, serene, from whom abundance springs, 35<BR>
Nurses of seasons, fruit-producing kings.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_99"></A><A HREF="hoo42.htm#fr_99">167:+</A> XXXVII. + The Curetes are plainly celebrated in this Hymn as the winds; the reason of which is as follows. Saturn, who according <A NAME="page_168"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 168</FONT></A> to the Orphic theology as related by Proclus, is allotted a supercelestial and intellectual essence produced Jupiter from Rhea. And Jupiter, or the demiurgus of the universe, silently emerged into light from the three principles, &AElig;ther, Chaos, and Night conflicting together, and mutually concurring with, and separating from each other. Now these three principles are interpreted by Julian, Orat. v. as the Corybantes: and hence with perfect agreement to the Orphic symbolical theology, the mutual conflict of these principles, is represented by the impetuous Fury of the winds.</P>
