###### LXXXIV.

### TO SLEEP.

###### The FUMIGATION from a Poppy.

SLEEP, king of Gods, and men of mortal birth,  
Sov'reign of all sustain'd by mother Earth;

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

For thy dominion is supreme alone,  
O'er all extended, and by all things known.  
'Tis thine all bodies with benignant mind 5  
In other bands than those of brass to bind:  
Tamer of cares, to weary toil repose,  
From whom sweet solace in affliction flows.  
Thy pleasing, gentle chains preserve the soul,  
And e'en the dreadful cares of death controul; 10  
For death and Lethe with oblivious stream,  
Mankind thy genuine brothers justly deem.  
With fav'ring aspect to my pray'r incline,  
And save thy mystics in their works divine.
