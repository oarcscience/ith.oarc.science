###### LX.

### TO NEMESIS.

###### A HYMN.

THEE, Nemesis I call, almighty queen,  
By whom the deeds of mortal life are seen:  
Eternal, much rever'd, of boundless sight,  
Alone rejoicing in the just and right:  
Changing the counsels of the human breast 5  
For ever various, rolling without rest.

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

To every mortal is thy influence known,  
And men beneath thy righteous bondage groan;  
For ev'ry thought within the mind conceal'd  
Is to thy fight perspicuously reveal'd. 10  
The soul unwilling reason to obey  
By lawless passion rul'd, thy eyes survey.  
All to see, hear, and rule, O pow'r divine  
Whose nature Equity contains, is thine.  
Come, blessed, holy Goddess, hear my pray'r, 15  
And make thy mystic's life, thy constant care:  
Give aid benignant in the needful hour,  
And strength abundant to the reas'ning pow'r;  
And far avert the dire, unfriendly race  
Of counsels impious, arrogant, and base. 20
