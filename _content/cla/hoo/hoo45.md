###### XL.

### TO THE CERALIAN MOTHER.

###### The FUMIGATION from AROMATICS.

CERALIAN queen, of celebrated name,  
From whom both men, and Gods immortal came;  
Who widely wand'ring once, oppress'd with grief,  
In Eleusina's valley found'st relief,

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

Discovering Proserpine thy daughter pure 5  
In dread Avernus, dismal and obscure;  
A sacred youth while thro' the world you stray  
Bacchus, attending leader of the way;  
The holy marriage of terrestrial Jove  
Relating, while oppress'd with grief you rove; 10  
Come, much invok'd, and to these rites inclin'd,  
Thy mystic suppliant bless, with fav'ring mind.
