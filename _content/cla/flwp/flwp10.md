#### Argument the Fourth.

<span class="smallcaps">Every</span> thing which is generated from a
cause essentially immovable is immovable. For if that which makes is
immovable, it is immutable; but if immutable, it makes by its very
being, not passing from efficient energy into non-efficiency, nor from
non-efficiency into efficiency. For if it had transition, it would also
have mutation, viz. a

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

transition from the one to the other. But if it has mutation, it will
not be immovable. Hence, if any thing is immovable, it will either never
be an effector, or it will always be so; lest, in consequence of being
effective at a certain time, it should be moved. So that if there is an
immovable cause of a certain thing, and which neither never is not <span
id="fr_28"></span>[\*](#fn_28) a cause, nor is a cause only at a certain
time, it will always be a cause. If, however, this be true, it will be
the cause of that which is perpetual. If, therefore, the cause of the
universe is immovable, (lest, being moved, he should be at first
imperfect, but afterwards perfect, since every motion is an imperfect
energy; and lest, being moved, he should be in want of time, though he
produces tithe,)—this being the case, it is necessary that the universe
should be perpetual, as being produced by an immovable cause. Hence, if
any one wishing to conceive piously of the cause of the universe, should
say that he alone is perpetual, but that this world is not perpetual, he
will evince that this cause is moved, and is not immovable, in
consequence of asserting that the world is not perpetual. But by
asserting that this cause is moved, and is not immovable, he must also
assert

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

that he is not always perfect, but that he was at a certain time
likewise imperfect, because all motion is imperfect energy, and is
indigent of that which is less excellent, viz. of time, through which
motion is effected. He, however, who asserts that this cause is at a
certain time imperfect, and not always perfect, and that he is indigent
of time, is transcendently impious. *Hence, he who, fancies that he is
pious towards the cause of the universe, in asserting that this cause
alone is perpetual, is, in thus asserting, remarkably impious*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_28"></span>[40:\*](flwp10.htm#fr_28) Ουκ is here
erroneously omitted in the original, and appears also to have been
omitted in the MS. from which Mahotius made his translation.
