*Fragments that Remain of the Lost Writings of Proclus*, by Thomas
Taylor, \[1825\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

#### From <span class="smallcaps">Olympiodorus</span>, in Aristot. Meteor. p. 59,

"<span class="smallcaps">It</span> is requisite to know that the divine
Proclus, in his Commentaries on the Timæus <span
id="fr_87"></span>[\*](#fn_87) of Plato, refers metals to the seven
planets, and says, that lead is ascribed to Saturn, through its weight,
dulness, and coldness. But electrum \[or a metal composed of gold and
silver\] is referred to Jupiter, through the well-tempered and vivific
nature of the star. In a similar manner, also, with respect to the metal
which is called *migma;* <span id="fr_88"></span>[†](#fn_88) but the
*migma* is more highly valued than gold, and is well tempered. Again,
iron is ascribed to Mars, on account of its incisive power and
sharpness; but gold to the sun, which is, as it were, the fountain of
light. Copper is referred to Venus, on account of its florid nature; and
also because

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Venus is near to
the sun, in the same manner as copper is to gold. Tin is referred to
Mercury, through its clearness and splendour, and at the same time,
likewise, because Mercury is near to the moon, just as tin is to silver.
And silver is ascribed to the moon; since silver when placed near to
gold, appears to be illuminated by the gold, and to become more
splendid, in the same manner as the moon is illuminated by the sun."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_87"></span>[108:\*](flwp26.htm#fr_87) This extract probably
formed a part of a Sixth Book of Proclus on the Timæus, which is lost,
as it is not to be found in any of the Five Books that are now extant.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[108:†](flwp26.htm#fr_88) From what Proclus says
of this metal, called *migma*, or, *a mixture*, it appears to be the
same with *orichalcum*, which Plato, in the Critias or Atlanticus, says,
"shines with a fiery splendour." Pliny, in list. Nat. lib. xxxiv. cap.
2, says, that this kind of metal has not existed for a long time, owing
to the barrenness of the earth. It is, however, mentioned by Martianus
the lawyer, who flourished in the time of Alexander Severus, as if it
then existed.
