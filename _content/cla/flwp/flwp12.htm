<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> Demiurgus alone can dissolve the world: for Plato says [in the Tim&aelig;us] that it is in every respect indissoluble, except by him by whom it was bound; for every where it is the province of him who knows [and is the cause of] a bond, to know also the mode of dissolving that which he bound; and it is the province of him who knows the mode of dissolution to dissolve. But the Demiurgus will never dissolve the world. For it is he who says [in the Tim&aelig;us of Plato], "that it pertains only to an evil nature to dissolve that which is beautifully harmonised and constituted well." But as it is impossible for him who is truly good to be evil, it is impossible that the world should be dissolved. For neither can it be dissolved by any other, because it is possible for the Demiurgus alone to dissolve it; nor can it be dissolved by its fabricator, because it is the province</p>

<p>of an evil nature to be willing to dissolve that which is beautifully harmonised. Either, therefore, he has not beautifully harmonised the world, and, in this case, he is not the best of artificers; or he has beautifully harmonised it, and will not dissolve it, lest he should become evil, which is a thing impossible. Hence the universe is indissoluble, and therefore incorruptible. But if incorruptible, it was not generated&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> [according to a temporal generation]. <i>For corruption pertains to every thing which is generated</i>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> as Socrates says in his conference with Tim&aelig;us on the preceding day,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A> not in his own words, but professing to utter what the Muses assert. And it is evident that Tim&aelig;us did not consider this dogma of the Muses to be superfluous; since he admits that there is a certain incorruptible genus. If, therefore, this be true, that which is incorruptible is unbegotten, [<i>i.e.</i> never had any temporal beginning of its existence]. But the world is incorruptible, and therefore is unbegotten. Hence also the world is perpetual, if it is unbegotten and incorruptible.</p>
