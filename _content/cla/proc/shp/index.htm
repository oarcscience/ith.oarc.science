Procopius, who also wrote a mainstream military history
and a toadying description of the monuments which Justinian built,
had to keep his most acute writing for posthumous publication.
This text flays Justinian and Theodora as corrupt, immoral,
and just plain evil.
Even though the account sounds fantastic, it is considered
genuine by modern historians (but not necessarily accurate).
Of course, the Eastern Orthodox Church considers Justinian a saint, so
you'll either love or hate this book.
</P>
<P>
The original title of this work was <CITE>Anecdota</CITE>,
which means (as far as I can tell) 'things not given over, withheld.'
I can say that there are a few <I>anecdotes</I>
here which fall into the realm of the fantastic.
Procopius speculates that Justinian might have been
something . . . not even human, perhaps vampiric.
He soberly quotes eyewitness accounts of Justinian
shapeshifting into a 'shapeless mass of flesh,'
and literally losing--and retrieving--his head (<A HREF="shp15.htm#page_132">p. 132</A>).
It sounds just like a modern horror movie special effect. . . .
In another place, the translation has Justinian killing a 'trillion' people.
The text actually says "A myriad myriads of myriads" (a myriad is the highest
number in Greek, 10,000). [By my reckoning, that is 10<SUP>5*3</SUP> =
10<SUP>15</SUP> = 100,000,000,000,000, or 100 trillion.]
All of this is a bit sophistical of course, what Procopius
obviously means here is &quot;a ridiculous number.&quot;
