# Ancient Fragments

### by I. P. Cory

#### \[1832 ed.\]

###### {reduced to HTML by Christopher M. Weimer, Dec. 2002}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This book is a collection of the fragments of documents relating to
ancient near eastern history and pagan beliefs that were preserved in
Greek and Latin. This book was published was before the great
discoveries in the interpretation of hieroglyphics and cuneiform, so
these documents were still thought to be the only reliable written
evidence for the period outside of the Bible and the Greek historians.
While all of the fragments are unquestionably ancient, some are more
ancient than others, and some may not actually be what they purport to
be (notably the oracles of Zoroaster). This does not necessarily reduce
their value as source material, although it does change the focus.

Please note also that this is far from being a 'critical edition' of the
text. The printed book is about three times as long as what is
reproduced here and also includes the original Greek or Latin text of
every selection, which is also not reproduced. Most of what is passed
over is of a more 'historical' that 'religious' cast, mostly king lists.
Also, the pagination of the 1832 edition was hopelessly muddled, so
there are no page numbers given in this edition, and the footnotes that
have been retained have been completely renumbered.
