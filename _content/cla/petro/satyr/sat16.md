# CHAPTER FIFTEEN

Eumolpus having declaimed this effusion with prodigious volubility, we
eventually entered the gates of Croton. Here we baited at a small, mean
inn, but started out next morning to find a lodging of greater
pretensions. We soon fell in with a mob of legacy hunters, who plied us
with questions as to who we were and where we came from. So we answered
both inquiries, in strict accordance with the plan arranged between us,
with an exaggerated glibness, and they believed every word of it; for
they instantly put their fortunes at Eumolpus's disposal, almost
fighting which should be first to do him this service. One and all offer
presents, in order to curry favor with the supposed millionaire.

\[CXXV <span id="CXXV"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl125) \] Things
went on thus at Croton for a long time, till Eumolpus, intoxicated with
success, so completely forgot his former lowly condition as to boast to
his followers how no one could resist his influence, and that any
misdemeanor they might have committed in the town, they could carry off
with impunity by his friends' good offices. For my part however, though
every day I stuffed my swollen carcass with a greater superfluity of
good things and really thought Fortune had at last ceased watching me
with an eye of malevolence, still I often reflected on my present mode
of life and the way it had come about. "What if some astute legacy
hunter," I often said to myself, "sent some one to Africa to make
inquiries, and discovered our swindle? What if Eumolpus's servant, as is
just possible, sick of this life of luxury, should give a hint to his
cronies and betray the whole imposture out of malice? Why! we should
just have to fly once more, return to the penury we have at last got the
better of, and start begging afresh. Gods and goddesses of heaven! what
a life outlaws lead, forever dreading the penalty of one felony or
another!"

\[CXXVI <span id="CXXVI"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl126) \] Thus
communing with myself, I quit the house in a most melancholy mood,
hoping to refresh my spirits with the open air out of doors. I had
scarcely entered the public promenade, when a girl of far from
unpleasing exterior met me, and calling "Polyaenos," the name I had
adopted by way of disguise, informed me that her mistress desired
permission to speak with me.

"You have surely made a mistake," I answered in some confusion; "I am
but a foreigner and a slave, and quite undeserving of the honor."

"Nay! my mission was to yourself," she returned; "but I see, because you
know your own beauty, you give yourself airs, and sell your favors,
instead of giving them. What else can those waved and well combed locks
mean, and that made-up face, and the languishing look of your eyes? For
what else that studied gait, and mincing steps that never exceed a
measured pace, except to sell your person by the meretricious display of
your charms? Look at me; I am no augur, no student of the planets like
the astrologers, yet I can infer a man's character from his looks, and
foretell his intentions the moment I see his way of walking. Therefore,
if you are willing to sell us what I require, there's a customer all
ready; or, if you will give it, like a gentleman, we shall be glad to be
under this obligation to you. You tell me you are a slave and a common
varlet; this only the more inflames my mistress's heated imagination.
There are women fancy muck, whose passions are stirred only at the sight
of slaves or runner boys with bare legs. Others are hot after
gladiators, or dusty muleteers, or actors swaggering on the boards. This
is the sort my mistress is; she jumps clean over the fourteen rows from
orchestra to gallery, to seek her choice among the rabble of the back
benches."

So, charmed with her fascinating chatter, "Tell me, my dear," I said,
"is this lady who loves me yourself?"

The maid laughed heartily at my cool way of putting it, saying, "Pray!
pray! don't be so mighty pleased with yourself. I've never given myself
to a slave yet; and God forbid I should waste my embraces on
gallows-birds. 'Tis their own lookout, if ladies go kissing the marks
the lash has left; for my part, though I'm only a servant maid, I never
go with anybody below a knight.

"Tastes differ 'tis as chance disposes;  
Some like thorns, and some like roses."

I was astounded at such abnormal predilections, and thought it monstrous
thus to find the maid with the mistress's fastidiousness, the mistress
with the maid's vulgar tastes.

Presently, after further pleasantries had passed, I begged the girl to
bring her mistress into the plane tree avenue. She was quite agreeable,
and tucking up her skirts dived into a laurel wood that bordered the
promenade. In a very few moments she brought out her mistress from where
she was hiding, and led her up to me, a more perfect being than ever
artist fashioned. There are no words to express her beauty, for anything
I can say will fall far short of the reality. Her locks, which curled
naturally, rippled all over her shoulders, her brow was low, the hair
being turned back from it, her brows, extending to the very spring of
the cheek, almost met between the eyes, which shone brighter than stars
in a moonless sky, her nose was slightly aquiline, her little mouth such
as Praxiteles gave Diana. Chin, neck, hands, snow-white feet confined in
elegant sandals of gold work, all vied with Parian marble in brilliancy.
For the first time I thought lightly of Doris, whose long-time admirer I
was.

Why tarries Jove, scorning the arts of Love,  
Mute and inglorious in the heavens above?  
How well the Bull would now the God become,  
Or his gray hairs to be transformed to down!  
Here's Danae's self,--a touch from her would fire,  
And make the God in liquid joys expire.

\[CXXVII <span id="CXXVII"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl127) \]
Quite delighted, she smiled so sweetly I thought I saw the moon breaking
full-faced from a cloud. Presently, with fingers punctuating her words,
she laughed, "If you are not too proud to enjoy a woman of condition,
and one who only within the year has known your sex. I offer you a
'sister,' fair youth. You have a 'brother' already, I know, for I did
not disdain to make inquiries, but what hinders you to adopt a sister
too? I claim a like dignity. Only taste and try, when you will, how you
like my kisses."

"Nay!" I replied, "by your own loveliness I adjure you, deign to admit
an alien among your worshipers. You will find him a sincere devotee, if
you give him leave to adore you. And that you may not think I enter this
temple of Love giftless, I will sacrifice my 'brother' to you."

"What!" she cried, "you sacrifice to me the being you cannot live
without, on whose kisses your happiness depends, whom you love as I
would have you love me?" As she said these words, they sounded so
sweetly you might have thought it was the Siren's harmonies came
floating on the breeze. So, lost in admiration and dazzled with a
wondrous effulgence brighter than the light of heaven, I was fain to ask
my divinity's name.

"Why! did not my maid tell you," she replied, "I was called Circe? I am
not indeed the daughter of the Sun; nor did my mother ever stay at her
good pleasure the course of the revolving globe. Still I have one noble
boon to thank heaven for, if the fates unite us two. Yes! some god's
mysterious, silent workings are beneath all this. 'Tis not without a
cause Circe loves Polyaenos; a great torch of sympathy flames between
these names. Then take your will of me, beloved one. For we have no
prying interference to dread, and your 'brother' is far away."

With these words Circe threw her arms, that were softer than down,
around my neck, and drew me down on the flower-bespangled grass:

On Ida's top, when Jove his nymph caressed,  
And lawless heat in open view expressed,  
His mother Earth in all her charms was seen,  
The rose, the violet, the sweet jasmine,  
And the fair lily smiling on the green.  
Such was the plat whereon my Venus lay;  
Our Love was secret, but the charming day  
Was bright, like her, and as her temple gay.

Side by side on the grass we lay, dallying with a thousand kisses, the
prelude to robuster joys. \[CXXVIIII <span
id="CXXVIIII"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl128) \] But alas! a
sudden debility of my nerves quite disappointed Circe, who exclaimed,
infuriated at the affront, "What now? do my kisses revolt you? is my
breath offensive with fasting? are my armpits uncleanly and smelling? If
it is nothing of this sort, can it be that you are afraid of Giton?"

Flushing hotly at her words, I lost any little vigor still left me, and
my whole frame feeling dislocated, I besought my mistress, "Do not, my
Queen, aggravate my misery. I am bewitched."

So trivial an excuse was far from appeasing Circe's indignation. She
turned her eyes contemptuously away from me, and glancing towards her
maid, "Tell me, Chrysis," she said, "and tell me true. Am I repulsive?
am I sluttish? is there some natural blemish disfigures my beauty? Do
not deceive your mistress; there must be something strangely amiss about
us."

Then, as Chrysis stood silent, she snatched up a mirror, and after
rehearsing all the looks and smiles lovers are wont to exchange, she
shook out her robe that lay crumpled on the ground, and flounced off
into the Temple of Venus. I was left standing like a convicted felon, or
a man horror-struck with some awful vision, asking myself whether the
bliss I had been cheated of was indeed a reality or only a dream.

As when in sleep our wanton Fancy sports,  
And our fond eyes with hidden riches courts,  
We hug the theft; the smiling treasure fills  
Our guilty hands; the conscious sweat distills;  
Whilst laboring fear sits heavy on the mind,  
Lest the big secret should an utterance find.  
But when with night th' illusive joys retreat,  
And our eyes open to the gay deceit,  
That which we ne'er possessed, as lost, we mourn,  
And for imaginary blessings burn.

My calamity really seemed to me a dream, or rather a hallucination; and
so long did my enervation last, I could not so much as get up off the
ground. However the mind recovering its tone by degrees, my strength
slowly came back to me, and I made for home, where feigning
indisposition, I threw myself down on my pallet. Before long, Giton, who
had heard I was ill, entered my chamber in much concern. To make his
mind easier, I told him I had gone to bed merely to take a rest, talking
a deal of other stuff besides, but not a word about my misadventure, as
I very much dreaded his jealousy. So to avoid all suspicion, drawing him
to my side, I tried to give him a proof of my love, but all my panting
and sweating was in vain. He got up full of indignation, and upbraiding
me with debilitated vigor and diminished affection, declared he had
noticed for a long time I must certainly have been expending my strength
of mind and body elsewhere.

"No! no! darling," I interrupted, "my affection for you has always been
the same; but reason now prevails over love and lechery."

"Well! thank you, thank you for the Socratic innocency of your passion.
Alcibiades was not more uncontaminated when he lay in his preceptor's
bed." \[CXXIX <span id="CXXIX"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl129) \]
"I tell you, little brother," I went on, "I have lost all knowledge and
sense of manhood. Dead and buried is that part of me that once made me a
very Achilles!"

Seeing I was really unnerved, and afraid, if he were caught alone with
me, it might give rise to scandal, he withdrew in haste, retreating to
an inner room of the house. He was hardly gone when Chrysis entered my
room and handed me her mistress's tablets, on which was written the
following letter:

CIRCE TO POLYAENOS--GREETING.

"If I were a mere wanton, I should complain of my disappointment.
Instead I am positively grateful to your impotence; for so I enjoyed
longer dalliance with the semblance of pleasure. What I ask is, how you
do, and whether you got home on your own legs; for doctors say a man
cannot walk without nerves. I will tell you what I think; beware, young
Sir, of paralysis. I never saw a patient in more imminent danger; upon
my word and honor, you are as good as dead already. If a like lethargy
attack your knees and hands, I should advise you to send immediately for
the undertaker's men.

"Well! well! dire as is the affront I have received, still I will never
grudge a prescription to a man in your miserable plight. If you would be
cured, ask Giton's help. You will recover your nerve, I assure you, if
you sleep three nights running apart from your 'little brother.' For
myself, I have no fear but I can find another admirer to love me a
little. My mirror and my reputation both tell me this is true.

Farewell, (if you can)"

As soon as Chrysis saw I had read this caustic epistle to the end,
"These accidents are common enough," she said, "and particularly in this
city, where there are women who can lure down the moon out of the sky.
So never fear, your matter shall be set right; only write back
graciously to my mistress and restore her confidence with a candid and
gently-worded reply. For to tell you the honest truth--from the hour you
wronged her, she has not been her own woman."

I complied very willingly with the girl's suggestion, and wrote the
following answer on the tablets:

\[CXXX <span id="CXXX"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl130) \]
POLYAENOS TO CIRCE--GREETING.

"I confess, Lady, I have often offended; I am but a man, and a young one
still. But never before this day have I done mortal sin. The criminal
admits his crime; any penalty you inflict, I have richly deserved. I
have betrayed a trust, slain a man, violated a temple; assign due
punishment for all these crimes. If you choose to kill me, I hand you my
sword; if you are satisfied with stripes, I haste to throw myself naked
at my mistress's feet. Remember one thing only, 'twas not myself, but my
tools that failed me. The soldier was ready but he had no arms. What so
demoralized me, I cannot tell. Perhaps my imagination outran my lagging
powers, perhaps in my all-aspiring eagerness, I lavished by ardor
prematurely. I know not how it was. You bid me beware of paralysis; as
if a greater palsy could exist than that which robbed me of the power to
possess you. But this is the sum and substance of my plea: I will
satisfy you yet, if you will grant me leave to repair my fault."

After dismissing Chrysis with fair promises of this sort, I put my body,
which had served me so ill, into special training, and pretermitting the
bath together, restricted myself to a moderate use of unguents. Then
adopting a more fortifying diet, that is to say onions and snails' heads
without sauce, I also cut down my wine. Finally composing my nerves by
an easy walk before retiring, I went to bed with no Giton to share my
couch. For anxious as I was to make my peace, I was afraid of even the
slightest contact with my favorite.

\[CXXXI <span id="CXXXI"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl131) \] Next
day, having risen sound in mind and body, I went down to the same plane
tree walk, though truly I felt a dread of the ominous locality, and
waited for Chrysis to act as my guide. After strolling to and fro for a
while, I had just sat down in the same spot as the day before, when she
came in sight, bringing a little old woman with her. When she had
saluted me, "How now, Sir Squeamsih," she began, "do you feel yourself
in better fettle?"

The old woman meantime drew from her pocket a hank of plaited yarns of
different colors, and tied it round my neck. Then puddling dust and
spittle together, she dipped her middle finder in the mess, and
disregarding my repugnance, marked my forehead with it.

Never despair! Priapus I invoke,  
To help the parts that make his altars smoke.

The incantation ended, she bade me spit out thrice, and thrice toss
pebbles into my bosom, which she had wrapped up in purple after
pronouncing a charm over them. Then putting her hands to my privates,
she began to try my virile condition. Quicker than thought the nerves
obeyed her summons, and filled the old lady's hand with a huge erection.
Then jumping for joy, "Look, Chrysis, look," she cried, "how I've
started the hare for other folk to course." This accomplished, the old
woman handed me back to Chrysis, who was overjoyed at the recovery of
her mistress's treasure; with all haste she led me straight to the
latter, whom we found in a most delightful spot, adorned with everything
that fairest Nature can show to charm the eyes.

Where noble Planes cast a refreshing shade,  
And well-cared Pines their shaking tops displayed,  
And Daphne midst the Cypress crowned her head.  
Near-by a circling river gently flows,  
And rolls the pebbles as it murmuring goes.  
A spot designed for Love; the nightingale  
And gentle swallow its delights can tell,  
Who on each bush salute the coming day,  
And in their orgies sing its hours away.

She lay luxuriously stretched on golden cushions, which supported her
marble neck, fanning the calm air with a branch of flowering myrtle.
Directly she saw me, she blushed a little, no doubt remembering
yesterday's affront; presently, when we were quite alone, and at her
invitation I had sat down by her side, she laid the branch over my eyes,
and this emboldening her as if a wall had been raised between us, "How
goes it, paralytic?" she laughed, "are you quite recovered, that you've
come back again today?"

"Why ask me," I returned, "instead of making trial?" and throwing myself
bodily into her arms, I took my fill of good, healthy, unbewitched
kisses. \[CXXXII <span
id="CXXXII"></span>[(Latin)](../satyrlat/satl132) \] Her loveliness drew
me irresistibly to her and disposed me to enjoyment. Already had our
lips joined in many a sounding kiss, our fingers interlocked had played
all sorts of amorous pranks, our two bodies had twined in mutual
embraces till our very souls seemed fused in one; yet in the very height
of these delicious preliminaries, lo! my nerves once more betrayed me,
and I failed utterly to reach the supreme moment of our bliss.

Lashed to fury by two such dire affronts, the lady ends by seeking
vengeance, and summoning her chamberlains, orders me a sound thumping.
Not content with this cruel treatment of me, she calls together all the
spinning wenches and meanest drudges of the house, and bids them spit at
me. Clapping my hands to my eyes, and without one word of expostulation,
for I knew I richly deserved it all, I fled from the house, driven forth
under a hurricane of blows and spittle. Proselenos is kicked out too,
and Chrysis beaten. The whole household was in dismay, all grumbling
together and asking who it was had put their mistress in so vile a
temper. This was some compensation and encouragement to me, and I
carefully hid the marks of the blows I had received, not to make
Eumolpus merry over my disaster, or Giton sad for the same reason. The
only thing I could do to save my dignity was to pretend to be ill; this
I did, and creeping into bed, turned the whole fire of my wrath against
the vile cause of all my calamities:

With dreadful steel the part I would have lopped;  
Thrice from my trembling hand the razor dropped.  
Now, what I might before, I could not do;  
For, cold as ice, the shuddering thing withdrew,  
And shrank behind a wrinkled canopy.  
Hiding its head from my revenge and me.  
Thus by its fear I'm balked of my intent,  
And in mere mouthing words my anger vent.

So raising myself on my elbow, I address the recreant in some such terms
as these, "What have you to say for yourself, abomination of gods and
men? For indeed your very name must not be mentioned by self-respecting
folks. Did I merit such treatment from you,--to be dragged down from
heaven's bliss to hell's torments, to have the prime and vigor of my
years maligned and to be reduced to the imbecility of dotage? Give me, I
beseech you, give me a proof you are yet good for something." In words
such as these I vented my irritation.

But with averted eyes, unmoved he mourned  
Nor to my fond reproach one look returned;  
Like bended osiers trembling o'er a brook,  
Or wounded poppies by no zephyr shook.

Nevertheless, on reaching the end of this undignified expostulation, I
began to be ashamed of what I had been saying, and to blush furtively at
having so far forgotten my self-respect as to bandy words with a part of
my person men of graver sort do not so much as deign to notice.
Presently after rubbing my brow awhile, "After all, what have I done so
much amiss," I asked myself, "in thus relieving my resentment by means
of a little natural abuse? Do we not habitually curse various parts of
our bodies, our belly, throat,--head even, when it aches, as it often
does? Does not Ulysses quarrel with his own heart? and do not our
Tragedians rail at their own eyes, as if they could hear? The gouty
abuse their feet, the rheumatic their hands, the sore-eyed their optics;
and does not a man who has damaged his toes, vent all the agony of his
pain on his poor feet?"

Nothing is falser than mankind's silly prejudices, or sillier than an
affectation of peculiar gravity.
