Part III.</h3> </p> 
<p>     The generosity of the Christian princes was cold and tardy; but in the first apprehension of a siege, Constantine had negotiated, in the isles of the Archipelago, the Morea, and Sicily, the most indispensable supplies.  As early as the beginning of April, five &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_882"></A><A HREF="#fn_882"><FONT SIZE="1">42</FONT></A> great ships, equipped for merchandise and war, would have sailed from the harbor of Chios, had not the wind blown obstinately from the north. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_883"></A><A HREF="#fn_883"><FONT SIZE="1">43</FONT></A> One of these ships bore the Imperial flag; the remaining four belonged to the Genoese; and they were laden with wheat and barley, with wine, oil, and vegetables, and, above all, with soldiers and mariners for the service of the capital.  After a tedious delay, a gentle breeze, and, on the second day, a strong gale from the south, carried them through the Hellespont and the Propontis: but the city was already invested by sea and land; and the Turkish fleet, at the entrance of the Bosphorus, was stretched from shore to shore, in the form of a crescent, to intercept, or at least to repel, these bold auxiliaries.  The reader who has present to his mind the geographical picture of Constantinople, will conceive and admire the greatness of the spectacle.  The five Christian ships continued to advance with joyful shouts, and a full press both of sails and oars, against a hostile fleet of three hundred vessels; and the rampart, the camp, the coasts of Europe and Asia, were lined with innumerable spectators, who anxiously awaited the event of this momentous succor.  At the first view that event could not appear doubtful; the superiority of the Moslems was beyond all measure or account: and, in a calm, their numbers and valor must inevitably have prevailed.  But their hasty and imperfect navy had been created, not by the genius of the people, but by the will of the sultan: in the height of their prosperity, the Turks have acknowledged, that if God had given them the earth, he had left the sea to the infidels; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_884"></A><A HREF="#fn_884"><FONT SIZE="1">44</FONT></A> and a series of defeats, a rapid progress of decay, has established the truth of their modest confession. Except eighteen galleys of some force, the rest of their fleet consisted of open boats, rudely constructed and awkwardly managed, crowded with troops, and destitute of cannon; and since courage arises in a great measure from the consciousness of strength, the bravest of the Janizaries might tremble on a new element.  In the Christian squadron, five stout and lofty ships were guided by skilful pilots, and manned with the veterans of Italy and Greece, long practised in the arts and perils of the sea.  Their weight was directed to sink or scatter the weak obstacles that impeded their passage: their artillery swept the waters: their liquid fire was poured on the heads of the adversaries, who, with the design of boarding, presumed to approach them; and the winds and waves are always on the side of the ablest navigators.  In this conflict, the Imperial vessel, which had been almost overpowered, was rescued by the Genoese; but the Turks, in a distant and closer attack, were twice repulsed with considerable loss.  Mahomet himself sat on horseback on the beach to encourage their valor by his voice and presence, by the promise of reward, and by fear more potent than the fear of the enemy.  The passions of his soul, and even the gestures of his body, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_885"></A><A HREF="#fn_885"><FONT SIZE="1">45</FONT></A> seemed to imitate the actions of the combatants; and, as if he had been the lord of nature, he spurred his horse with a fearless and impotent effort into the sea.  His loud reproaches, and the clamors of the camp, urged the Ottomans to a third attack, more fatal and bloody than the two former; and I must repeat, though I cannot credit, the evidence of Phranza, who affirms, from their own mouth, that they lost above twelve thousand men in the slaughter of the day.  They fled in disorder to the shores of Europe and Asia, while the Christian squadron, triumphant and unhurt, steered along the Bosphorus, and securely anchored within the chain of the harbor.  In the confidence of victory, they boasted that the whole Turkish power must have yielded to their arms; but the admiral, or captain bashaw, found some consolation for a painful wound in his eye, by representing that accident as the cause of his defeat.  Balthi Ogli was a renegade of the race of the Bulgarian princes: his military character was tainted with the unpopular vice of avarice; and under the despotism of the prince or people, misfortune is a sufficient evidence of guilt. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_886"></A><A HREF="#fn_886"><FONT SIZE="1">*_0059</FONT></A> His rank and services were annihilated by the displeasure of Mahomet.  In the royal presence, the captain bashaw was extended on the ground by four slaves, and received one hundred strokes with a golden rod: &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_887"></A><A HREF="#fn_887"><FONT SIZE="1">46</FONT></A> his death had been pronounced; and he adored the clemency of the sultan, who was satisfied with the milder punishment of confiscation and exile.  The introduction of this supply revived the hopes of the Greeks, and accused the supineness of their Western allies.  Amidst the deserts of Anatolia and the rocks of Palestine, the millions of the crusades had buried themselves in a voluntary and inevitable grave; but the situation of the Imperial city was strong against her enemies, and accessible to her friends; and a rational and moderate armament of the marine states might have saved the relics of the Roman name, and maintained a Christian fortress in the heart of the Ottoman empire.  Yet this was the sole and feeble attempt for the deliverance of Constantinople: the more distant powers were insensible of its danger; and the ambassador of Hungary, or at least of Huniades, resided in the Turkish camp, to remove the fears, and to direct the operations, of the sultan. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_888"></A><A HREF="#fn_888"><FONT SIZE="1">47</FONT></A> </p>

<p>     It was difficult for the Greeks to penetrate the secret of the divan; yet the Greeks are persuaded, that a resistance so obstinate and surprising, had fatigued the perseverance of Mahomet.  He began to meditate a retreat; and the siege would have been speedily raised, if the ambition and jealousy of the second vizier had not opposed the perfidious advice of Calil Bashaw, who still maintained a secret correspondence with the Byzantine court.  The reduction of the city appeared to be hopeless, unless a double attack could be made from the harbor as well as from the land; but the harbor was inaccessible: an impenetrable chain was now defended by eight large ships, more than twenty of a smaller size, with several galleys and sloops; and, instead of forcing this barrier, the Turks might apprehend a naval sally, and a second encounter in the open sea.  In this perplexity, the genius of Mahomet conceived and executed a plan of a bold and marvellous cast, of transporting by land his lighter vessels and military stores from the Bosphorus into the higher part of the harbor.  The distance is about ten &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_889"></A><A HREF="#fn_890"><FONT SIZE="1">*_0060</FONT></A> miles; the ground is uneven, and was overspread with thickets; and, as the road must be opened behind the suburb of Galata, their free passage or total destruction must depend on the option of the Genoese.  But these selfish merchants were ambitious of the favor of being the last devoured; and the deficiency of art was supplied by the strength of obedient myraids.  A level way was covered with a broad platform of strong and solid planks; and to render them more slippery and smooth, they were anointed with the fat of sheep and oxen.  Fourscore light galleys and brigantines, of fifty and thirty oars, were disembarked on the Bosphorus shore; arranged successively on rollers; and drawn forwards by the power of men and pulleys. Two guides or pilots were stationed at the helm, and the prow, of each vessel: the sails were unfurled to the winds; and the labor was cheered by song and acclamation.  In the course of a single night, this Turkish fleet painfully climbed the hill, steered over the plain, and was launched from the declivity into the shallow waters of the harbor, far above the molestation of the deeper vessels of the Greeks.  The real importance of this operation was magnified by the consternation and confidence which it inspired: but the notorious, unquestionable fact was displayed before the eyes, and is recorded by the pens, of the two nations. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_890"></A><A HREF="#fn_889"><FONT SIZE="1">48</FONT></A> A similar stratagem had been repeatedly practised by the ancients; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_891"></A><A HREF="#fn_891"><FONT SIZE="1">49</FONT></A> the Ottoman galleys (I must again repeat) should be considered as large boats; and, if we compare the magnitude and the distance, the obstacles and the means, the boasted miracle &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_892"></A><A HREF="#fn_892"><FONT SIZE="1">50</FONT></A> has perhaps been equalled by the industry of our own times. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_893"></A><A HREF="#fn_893"><FONT SIZE="1">51</FONT></A> As soon as Mahomet had occupied the upper harbor with a fleet and army, he constructed, in the narrowest part, a bridge, or rather mole, of fifty cubits in breadth, and one hundred in length: it was formed of casks and hogsheads; joined with rafters, linked with iron, and covered with a solid floor.  On this floating battery he planted one of his largest cannon, while the fourscore galleys, with troops and scaling ladders, approached the most accessible side, which had formerly been stormed by the Latin conquerors.  The indolence of the Christians has been accused for not destroying these unfinished works; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_894"></A><A HREF="#fn_894"><FONT SIZE="1">!_0060</FONT></A> but their fire, by a superior fire, was controlled and silenced; nor were they wanting in a nocturnal attempt to burn the vessels as well as the bridge of the sultan. His vigilance prevented their approach; their foremost galiots were sunk or taken; forty youths, the bravest of Italy and Greece, were inhumanly massacred at his command; nor could the emperor's grief be assuaged by the just though cruel retaliation, of exposing from the walls the heads of two hundred and sixty Mussulman captives.  After a siege of forty days, the fate of Constantinople could no longer be averted.  The diminutive garrison was exhausted by a double attack: the fortifications, which had stood for ages against hostile violence, were dismantled on all sides by the Ottoman cannon: many breaches were opened; and near the gate of St. Romanus, four towers had been levelled with the ground.  For the payment of his feeble and mutinous troops, Constantine was compelled to despoil the churches with the promise of a fourfold restitution; and his sacrilege offered a new reproach to the enemies of the union.  A spirit of discord impaired the remnant of the Christian strength; the Genoese and Venetian auxiliaries asserted the preeminence of their respective service; and Justiniani and the great duke, whose ambition was not extinguished by the common danger, accused each other of treachery and cowardice. </p>

<p>     During the siege of Constantinople, the words of peace and capitulation had been sometimes pronounced; and several embassies had passed between the camp and the city. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_895"></A><A HREF="#fn_895"><FONT SIZE="1">52</FONT></A> The Greek emperor was humbled by adversity; and would have yielded to any terms compatible with religion and royalty.  The Turkish sultan was desirous of sparing the blood of his soldiers; still more desirous of securing for his own use the Byzantine treasures: and he accomplished a sacred duty in presenting to the Gabours the choice of circumcision, of tribute, or of death.  The avarice of Mahomet might have been satisfied with an annual sum of one hundred thousand ducats; but his ambition grasped the capital of the East: to the prince he offered a rich equivalent, to the people a free toleration, or a safe departure: but after some fruitless treaty, he declared his resolution of finding either a throne, or a grave, under the walls of Constantinople.  A sense of honor, and the fear of universal reproach, forbade Palaeologus to resign the city into the hands of the Ottomans; and he determined to abide the last extremities of war. Several days were employed by the sultan in the preparations of the assault; and a respite was granted by his favorite science of astrology, which had fixed on the twenty-ninth of May, as the fortunate and fatal hour.  On the evening of the twenty-seventh, he issued his final orders; assembled in his presence the military chiefs, and dispersed his heralds through the camp to proclaim the duty, and the motives, of the perilous enterprise.  Fear is the first principle of a despotic government; and his menaces were expressed in the Oriental style, that the fugitives and deserters, had they the wings of a bird, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_896"></A><A HREF="#fn_896"><FONT SIZE="1">53</FONT></A> should not escape from his inexorable justice.  The greatest part of his bashaws and Janizaries were the offspring of Christian parents: but the glories of the Turkish name were perpetuated by successive adoption; and in the gradual change of individuals, the spirit of a legion, a regiment, or an oda, is kept alive by imitation and discipline.  In this holy warfare, the Moslems were exhorted to purify their minds with prayer, their bodies with seven ablutions; and to abstain from food till the close of the ensuing day. A crowd of dervises visited the tents, to instil the desire of martyrdom, and the assurance of spending an immortal youth amidst the rivers and gardens of paradise, and in the embraces of the black-eyed virgins.  Yet Mahomet principally trusted to the efficacy of temporal and visible rewards.  A double pay was promised to the victorious troops: "The city and the buildings," said Mahomet, "are mine; but I resign to your valor the captives and the spoil, the treasures of gold and beauty; be rich and be happy.  Many are the provinces of my empire: the intrepid soldier who first ascends the walls of Constantinople shall be rewarded with the government of the fairest and most wealthy; and my gratitude shall accumulate his honors and fortunes above the measure of his own hopes." Such various and potent motives diffused among the Turks a general ardor, regardless of life and impatient for action: the camp reechoed with the Moslem shouts of "God is God: there is but one God, and Mahomet is the apostle of God;" &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_897"></A><A HREF="#fn_897"><FONT SIZE="1">54</FONT></A> and the sea and land, from Galata to the seven towers, were illuminated by the blaze of their nocturnal fires. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_898"></A><A HREF="#fn_898"><FONT SIZE="1">*_0061</FONT></A> </p> 
<p>
  
  
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>     Far different was the state of the Christians; who, with loud and impotent complaints, deplored the guilt, or the punishment, of their sins. The celestial image of the Virgin had been exposed in solemn procession; but their divine patroness was deaf to their entreaties: they accused the obstinacy of the emperor for refusing a timely surrender; anticipated the horrors of their fate; and sighed for the repose and security of Turkish servitude.  The noblest of the Greeks, and the bravest of the allies, were summoned to the palace, to prepare them, on the evening of the twenty-eighth, for the duties and dangers of the general assault.  The last speech of Palaeologus was the funeral oration of the Roman empire: &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_899"></A><A HREF="#fn_899"><FONT SIZE="1">55</FONT></A> he promised, he conjured, and he vainly attempted to infuse the hope which was extinguished in his own mind. In this world all was comfortless and gloomy; and neither the gospel nor the church have proposed any conspicuous recompense to the heroes who fall in the service of their country.  But the example of their prince, and the confinement of a siege, had armed these warriors with the courage of despair, and the pathetic scene is described by the feelings of the historian Phranza, who was himself present at this mournful assembly. They wept, they embraced; regardless of their families and fortunes, they devoted their lives; and each commander, departing to his station, maintained all night a vigilant and anxious watch on the rampart.  The emperor, and some faithful companions, entered the dome of St. Sophia, which in a few hours was to be converted into a mosque; and devoutly received, with tears and prayers, the sacrament of the holy communion.  He reposed some moments in the palace, which resounded with cries and lamentations; solicited the pardon of all whom he might have injured; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_900"></A><A HREF="#fn_900"><FONT SIZE="1">56</FONT></A> and mounted on horseback to visit the guards, and explore the motions of the enemy.  The distress and fall of the last Constantine are more glorious than the long prosperity of the Byzantine Caesars. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_901"></A><A HREF="#fn_901"><FONT SIZE="1">*_0062</FONT></A>  
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>     In the confusion of darkness, an assailant may sometimes succeed; out in this great and general attack, the military judgment and astrological knowledge of Mahomet advised him to expect the morning, the memorable twenty- ninth of May, in the fourteen hundred and fifty-third year of the Christian aera.  The preceding night had been strenuously employed: the troops, the cannons, and the fascines, were advanced to the edge of the ditch, which in many parts presented a smooth and level passage to the breach; and his fourscore galleys almost touched, with the prows and their scaling-ladders, the less defensible walls of the harbor.  Under pain of death, silence was enjoined: but the physical laws of motion and sound are not obedient to discipline or fear; each individual might suppress his voice and measure his footsteps; but the march and labor of thousands must inevitably produce a strange confusion of dissonant clamors, which reached the ears of the watchmen of the towers.  At daybreak, without the customary signal of the morning gun, the Turks assaulted the city by sea and land; and the similitude of a twined or twisted thread has been applied to the closeness and continuity of their line of attack. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_902"></A><A HREF="#fn_902"><FONT SIZE="1">57</FONT></A> The foremost ranks consisted of the refuse of the host, a voluntary crowd who fought without order or command; of the feebleness of age or childhood, of peasants and vagrants, and of all who had joined the camp in the blind hope of plunder and martyrdom.  The common impulse drove them onwards to the wall; the most audacious to climb were instantly precipitated; and not a dart, not a bullet, of the Christians, was idly wasted on the accumulated throng.  But their strength and ammunition were exhausted in this laborious defence: the ditch was filled with the bodies of the slain; they supported the footsteps of their companions; and of this devoted vanguard the death was more serviceable than the life.  Under their respective bashaws and sanjaks, the troops of Anatolia and Romania were successively led to the charge: their progress was various and doubtful; but, after a conflict of two hours, the Greeks still maintained, and improved their advantage; and the voice of the emperor was heard, encouraging his soldiers to achieve, by a last effort, the deliverance of their country.  In that fatal moment, the Janizaries arose, fresh, vigorous, and invincible. The sultan himself on horseback, with an iron mace in his hand, was the spectator and judge of their valor: he was surrounded by ten thousand of his domestic troops, whom he reserved for the decisive occasion; and the tide of battle was directed and impelled by his voice and eye.  His numerous ministers of justice were posted behind the line, to urge, to restrain, and to punish; and if danger was in the front, shame and inevitable death were in the rear, of the fugitives.  The cries of fear and of pain were drowned in the martial music of drums, trumpets, and attaballs; and experience has proved, that the mechanical operation of sounds, by quickening the circulation of the blood and spirits, will act on the human machine more forcibly than the eloquence of reason and honor.  From the lines, the galleys, and the bridge, the Ottoman artillery thundered on all sides; and the camp and city, the Greeks and the Turks, were involved in a cloud of smoke which could only be dispelled by the final deliverance or destruction of the Roman empire.  The single combats of the heroes of history or fable amuse our fancy and engage our affections: the skilful evolutions of war may inform the mind, and improve a necessary, though pernicious, science.  But in the uniform and odious pictures of a general assault, all is blood, and horror, and confusion nor shall I strive, at the distance of three centuries, and a thousand miles, to delineate a scene of which there could be no spectators, and of which the actors themselves were incapable of forming any just or adequate idea. </p> 
<p>
       The immediate loss of Constantinople may be ascribed to the bullet, or arrow, which pierced the gauntlet of John Justiniani.  The sight of his blood, and the exquisite pain, appalled the courage of the chief, whose arms and counsels were the firmest rampart of the city.  As he withdrew from his station in quest of a surgeon, his flight was perceived and stopped by the indefatigable emperor.  "Your wound," exclaimed Palaeologus, "is slight; the danger is pressing: your presence is necessary; and whither will you retire?" - "I will retire," said the trembling Genoese, "by the same road which God has opened to the Turks;" and at these words he hastily passed through one of the breaches of the inner wall.  By this pusillanimous act he stained the honors of a military life; and the few days which he survived in Galata, or the Isle of Chios, were embittered by his own and the public reproach. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_903"></A><A HREF="#fn_903"><FONT SIZE="1">58</FONT></A> His example was imitated by the greatest part of the Latin auxiliaries, and the defence began to slacken when the attack was pressed with redoubled vigor.  The number of the Ottomans was fifty, perhaps a hundred, times superior to that of the Christians; the double walls were reduced by the cannon to a heap of ruins: in a circuit of several miles, some places must be found more easy of access, or more feebly guarded; and if the besiegers could penetrate in a single point, the whole city was irrecoverably lost. The first who deserved the sultan's reward was Hassan the Janizary, of gigantic stature and strength.  With his cimeter in one hand and his buckler in the other, he ascended the outward fortification: of the thirty Janizaries, who were emulous of his valor, eighteen perished in the bold adventure.  Hassan and his twelve companions had reached the summit: the giant was precipitated from the rampart: he rose on one knee, and was again oppressed by a shower of darts and stones.  But his success had proved that the achievement was possible: the walls and towers were instantly covered with a swarm of Turks; and the Greeks, now driven from the vantage ground, were overwhelmed by increasing multitudes.  Amidst these multitudes, the emperor, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_904"></A><A HREF="#fn_904"><FONT SIZE="1">59</FONT></A> who accomplished all the duties of a general and a soldier, was long seen and finally lost.  The nobles, who fought round his person, sustained, till their last breath, the honorable names of Palaeologus and Cantacuzene: his mournful exclamation was heard, "Cannot there be found a Christian to cut off my head?" &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_905"></A><A HREF="#fn_905"><FONT SIZE="1">60</FONT></A> and his last fear was that of falling alive into the hands of the infidels. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_906"></A><A HREF="#fn_906"><FONT SIZE="1">61</FONT></A> The prudent despair of Constantine cast away the purple: amidst the tumult he fell by an unknown hand, and his body was buried under a mountain of the slain.  After his death, resistance and order were no more: the Greeks fled towards the city; and many were pressed and stifled in the narrow pass of the gate of St. Romanus.  The victorious Turks rushed through the breaches of the inner wall; and as they advanced into the streets, they were soon joined by their brethren, who had forced the gate Phenar on the side of the harbor. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_907"></A><A HREF="#fn_907"><FONT SIZE="1">62</FONT></A> In the first heat of the pursuit, about two thousand Christians were put to the sword; but avarice soon prevailed over cruelty; and the victors acknowledged, that they should immediately have given quarter if the valor of the emperor and his chosen bands had not prepared them for a similar opposition in every part of the capital.  It was thus, after a siege of fifty-three days, that Constantinople, which had defied the power of Chosroes, the Chagan, and the caliphs, was irretrievably subdued by the arms of Mahomet the Second.  Her empire only had been subverted by the Latins: her religion was trampled in the dust by the Moslem conquerors. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_908"></A><A HREF="#fn_908"><FONT SIZE="1">63</FONT></A>

<p>     The tidings of misfortune fly with a rapid wing; yet such was the extent of Constantinople, that the more distant quarters might prolong, some moments, the happy ignorance of their ruin. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_909"></A><A HREF="#fn_909"><FONT SIZE="1">64</FONT></A> But in the general consternation, in the feelings of selfish or social anxiety, in the tumult and thunder of the assault, a sleepless night and morning &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_910"></A><A HREF="#fn_910"><FONT SIZE="1">*_0063</FONT></A> must have elapsed; nor can I believe that many Grecian ladies were awakened by the Janizaries from a sound and tranquil slumber.  On the assurance of the public calamity, the houses and convents were instantly deserted; and the trembling inhabitants flocked together in the streets, like a herd of timid animals, as if accumulated weakness could be productive of strength, or in the vain hope, that amid the crowd each individual might be safe and invisible.  From every part of the capital, they flowed into the church of St. Sophia: in the space of an hour, the sanctuary, the choir, the nave, the upper and lower galleries, were filled with the multitudes of fathers and husbands, of women and children, of priests, monks, and religious virgins: the doors were barred on the inside, and they sought protection from the sacred dome, which they had so lately abhorred as a profane and polluted edifice.  Their confidence was founded on the prophecy of an enthusiast or impostor; that one day the Turks would enter Constantinople, and pursue the Romans as far as the column of Constantine in the square before St. Sophia: but that this would be the term of their calamities: that an angel would descend from heaven, with a sword in his hand, and would deliver the empire, with that celestial weapon, to a poor man seated at the foot of the column.  "Take this sword," would he say, "and avenge the people of the Lord." At these animating words, the Turks would instantly fly, and the victorious Romans would drive them from the West, and from all Anatolia as far as the frontiers of Persia.  It is on this occasion that Ducas, with some fancy and much truth, upbraids the discord and obstinacy of the Greeks.  "Had that angel appeared," exclaims the historian, "had he offered to exterminate your foes if you would consent to the union of the church, even event then, in that fatal moment, you would have rejected your safety, or have deceived your God." &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_911"></A><A HREF="#fn_911"><FONT SIZE="1">65</FONT></A> </p>

<P><A NAME="fn_889"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_890">48</A> The unanimous testimony of the four Greeks is confirmed by Cantemir (p. 96) from the Turkish annals; but I could wish to contract the distance of ten miles, and to prolong the term of one night.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_890"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_889">*_0060</A> Six miles, not ten.  Von Hammer. - M</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_891"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_891">49</A> Phranza relates two examples of a similar transportation over the six miles of the Isthmus of Corinth; the one fabulous, of Augustus after the battle of Actium; the other true, of Nicetas, a Greek general in the xth century.  To these he might have added a bold enterprise of Hannibal, to introduce his vessels into the harbor of Tarentum, (Polybius, l. viii. p. 749, edit. Gronov.) </p> 
<p>     Note: Von Hammer gives a longer list of such transportations, p. 533. Dion Cassius distinctly relates the occurrence treated as fabulous by Gibbon. - M.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_892"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_892">50</A> A Greek of Candia, who had served the Venetians in a similar undertaking, (Spond. A.D. 1438, No. 37,) might possibly be the adviser and agent of Mahomet.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_893"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_893">51</A> I particularly allude to our own embarkations on the lakes of Canada in the years 1776 and 1777, so great in the labor, so fruitless in the event.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_894"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_894">!_0060</A> They were betrayed, according to some accounts, by the Genoese of Galata.  Von Hammer, p. 536. - M.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_895"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_895">52</A> Chalcondyles and Ducas differ in the time and circumstances of the negotiation; and as it was neither glorious nor salutory, the faithful Phranza spares his prince even the thought of a surrender.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_896"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_896">53</A> These wings (Chalcondyles, l. viii. p. 208) are no more than an Oriental figure: but in the tragedy of Irene, Mahomet's passion soars above sense and reason: - </p> 
<p>     Should the fierce North, upon his frozen wings.      Bear him aloft above the wondering clouds,      And seat him in the Pleiads' golden chariot -      Then should my fury drag him down to tortures. </p> 
<p>Besides the extravagance of the rant, I must observe, 1. That the operation of the winds must be confined to the lower region of the air.  2. That the name, etymology, and fable of the Pleiads are purely Greek, (Scholiast ad Homer, Sigma 686.  Eudocia in Ionia, p. 399.  Apollodor. l. iii. c. 10. Heyne, p. 229, Not. 682,) and had no affinity with the astronomy of the East, (Hyde ad Ulugbeg, Tabul. in Syntagma Dissert. tom. i. p. 40, 42. Goguet, Origine des Arts, &c., tom. vi. p. 73 - 78.  Gebelin, Hist. du Calendrier, p. 73,) which Mahomet had studied.  3. The golden chariot does not exist either in science or fiction; but I much fear Dr. Johnson has confounded the Pleiades with the great bear or wagon, the zodiac with a northern constalation.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_897"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_897">54</A> Phranza quarrels with these Moslem acclamations, not for the name of God, but for that of the prophet: the pious zeal of Voltaire is excessive, and even ridiculous.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_898"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_898">*_0061</A> The picture is heightened by the addition of the wailing cries of Kyris, which were heard from the dark interior of the city.  Von Hammer p. 539. - M.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_899"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_899">55</A> I am afraid that this discourse was composed by Phranza himself; and it smells so grossly of the sermon and the convent, that I almost doubt whether it was pronounced by Constantine.  Leonardus assigns him another speech, in which he addresses himself more respectfully to the Latin auxiliaries.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_900"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_900">56</A> This abasement, which devotion has sometimes extorted from dying princes, is an improvement of the gospel doctrine of the forgiveness of injuries: it is more easy to forgive 490 times, than once to ask pardon of an inferior.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_901"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_901">*_0062</A> Compare the very curious Armenian elegy on the fall of Constantinople, translated by M. Bore, in the Journal Asiatique for March, 1835; and by M. Brosset, in the new edition of Le Beau, (tom. xxi. p. 308.) The author thus ends his poem: "I, Abraham, loaded with sins, have composed this elegy with the most lively sorrow; for I have seen Constantinople in the days of its glory." - M.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_902"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_902">57</A> Besides the 10,000 guards, and the sailors and the marines, Ducas numbers in this general assault 250,000 Turks, both horse and foot.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_903"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_903">58</A> In the severe censure of the flight of Justiniani, Phranza expresses his own feelings and those of the public.  For some private reasons, he is treated with more lenity and respect by Ducas; but the words of Leonardus Chiensis express his strong and recent indignation, gloriae salutis suique oblitus.  In the whole series of their Eastern policy, his countrymen, the Genoese, were always suspected, and often guilty. </p> 
<p>     Note: M. Brosset has given some extracts from the Georgian account of the siege of Constantinople, in which Justiniani's wound in the left foot is represented as more serious.  With charitable ambiguity the chronicler adds that his soldiers carried him away with them in their vessel. - M.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_904"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_904">59</A> Ducas kills him with two blows of Turkish soldiers; Chalcondyles wounds him in the shoulder, and then tramples him in the gate. The grief of Phranza, carrying him among the enemy, escapes from the precise image of his death; but we may, without flattery, apply these noble lines of Dryden: -       As to Sebastian, let them search the field;      And where they find a mountain of the slain,      Send one to climb, and looking down beneath,      There they will find him at his manly length,      With his face up to heaven, in that red monument      Which his good sword had digged.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_905"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_905">60</A> Spondanus, (A.D. 1453, No. 10,) who has hopes of his salvation, wishes to absolve this demand from the guilt of suicide.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_906"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_906">61</A> Leonardus Chiensis very properly observes, that the Turks, had they known the emperor, would have labored to save and secure a captive so acceptable to the sultan.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_907"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_907">62</A> Cantemir, p. 96.  The Christian ships in the mouth of the harbor had flanked and retarded this naval attack.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_908"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_908">63</A> Chalcondyles most absurdly supposes, that Constantinople was sacked by the Asiatics in revenge for the ancient calamities of Troy; and the grammarians of the xvth century are happy to melt down the uncouth appellation of Turks into the more classical name of Teucri.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_909"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_909">64</A> When Cyrus suppressed Babylon during the celebration of a festival, so vast was the city, and so careless were the inhabitants, that much time elapsed before the distant quarters knew that they were captives. Herodotus, (l. i. c. 191,) and Usher, (Annal. p. 78,) who has quoted from the prophet Jeremiah a passage of similar import.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_910"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_910">*_0063</A> This refers to an expression in Ducas, who, to heighten the effect of his description, speaks of the "sweet morning sleep resting on the eyes of youths and maidens," p. 288.  Edit. Bekker. - M.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_911"></A><A HREF="daf06031.htm#fr_911">65</A> This lively description is extracted from Ducas, (c. 39,) who two years afterwards was sent ambassador from the prince of Lesbos to the sultan, (c. 44.) Till Lesbos was subdued in 1463, (Phranza, l. iii. c. 27,) that island must have been full of the fugitives of Constantinople, who delighted to repeat, perhaps to adorn, the tale of their misery.</P>
