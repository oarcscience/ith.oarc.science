<p>     In the midst of a rocky and barren country, the walls of Jerusalem &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1085"></A><A HREF="#fn_1084"><FONT SIZE="1">59</FONT></A> enclosed the two mountains of Sion and Acra, within an oval figure of about three English miles. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1086"></A><A HREF="#fn_1085"><FONT SIZE="1">60</FONT></A> Towards the south, the upper town, and the fortress of David, were erected on the lofty ascent of Mount Sion: on the north side, the buildings of the lower town covered the spacious summit of Mount Acra; and a part of the hill, distinguished by the name of Moriah, and levelled by human industry, was crowned with the stately temple of the Jewish nation.  After the final destruction of the temple by the arms of Titus and Hadrian, a ploughshare was drawn over the consecrated ground, as a sign of perpetual interdiction.  Sion was deserted; and the vacant space of the lower city was filled with the public and private edifices of the Aelian colony, which spread themselves over the adjacent hill of Calvary. The holy places were polluted with mountains of idolatry; and, either from design or accident, a chapel was dedicated to Venus, on the spot which had been sanctified by the death and resurrection of Christ. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1087"></A><A HREF="#fn_1086"><FONT SIZE="1">61</FONT></A> &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1088"></A><A HREF="#fn_1087"><FONT SIZE="1">*_0054</FONT></A> Almost three hundred years after those stupendous events, the profane chapel of Venus was demolished by the order of Constantine; and the removal of the earth and stones revealed the holy sepulchre to the eyes of mankind.  A magnificent church was erected on that mystic ground, by the first Christian emperor; and the effects of his pious munificence were extended to every spot which had been consecrated by the footstep of patriarchs, of prophets, and of the Son of God. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1089"></A><A HREF="#fn_1088"><FONT SIZE="1">62</FONT></A>

       The passionate desire of contemplating the original monuments of their redemption attracted to Jerusalem a successive crowd of pilgrims, from the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, and the most distant countries of the East; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1090"></A><A HREF="#fn_1089"><FONT SIZE="1">63</FONT></A> &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1091"></A><A HREF="#fn_1090"><FONT SIZE="1">*_0055</FONT></A> and their piety was authorized by the example of the empress Helena, who appears to have united the credulity of age with the warm feelings of a recent conversion.  Sages and heroes, who have visited the memorable scenes of ancient wisdom or glory, have confessed the inspiration of the genius of the place; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1092"></A><A HREF="#fn_1091"><FONT SIZE="1">64</FONT></A> and the Christian who knelt before the holy sepulchre, ascribed his lively faith, and his fervent devotion, to the more immediate influence of the Divine Spirit.  The zeal, perhaps the avarice, of the clergy of Jerusalem, cherished and multiplied these beneficial visits. They fixed, by unquestionable tradition, the scene of each memorable event. They exhibited the instruments which had been used in the passion of Christ; the nails and the lance that had pierced his hands, his feet, and his side; the crown of thorns that was planted on his head; the pillar at which he was scourged; and, above all, they showed the cross on which he suffered, and which was dug out of the earth in the reign of those princes, who inserted the symbol of Christianity in the banners of the Roman legions. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1093"></A><A HREF="#fn_1092"><FONT SIZE="1">65</FONT></A> Such miracles as seemed necessary to account for its extraordinary preservation, and seasonable discovery, were gradually propagated without opposition.  The custody of the true cross, which on Easter Sunday was solemnly exposed to the people, was intrusted to the bishop of Jerusalem; and he alone might gratify the curious devotion of the pilgrims, by the gift of small pieces, which they encased in gold or gems, and carried away in triumph to their respective countries.  But as this gainful branch of commerce must soon have been annihilated, it was found convenient to suppose, that the marvelous wood possessed a secret power of vegetation; and that its substance, though continually diminished, still remained entire and unimpaired. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1094"></A><A HREF="#fn_1093"><FONT SIZE="1">66</FONT></A> It might perhaps have been expected, that the influence of the place and the belief of a perpetual miracle, should have produced some salutary effects on the morals, as well as on the faith, of the people.  Yet the most respectable of the ecclesiastical writers have been obliged to confess, not only that the streets of Jerusalem were filled with the incessant tumult of business and pleasure, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1095"></A><A HREF="#fn_1094"><FONT SIZE="1">67</FONT></A> but that every species of vice - adultery, theft, idolatry, poisoning, murder - was familiar to the inhabitants of the holy city. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1096"></A><A HREF="#fn_1095"><FONT SIZE="1">68</FONT></A> The wealth and preeminence of the church of Jerusalem excited the ambition of Arian, as well as orthodox, candidates; and the virtues of Cyril, who, since his death, has been honored with the title of Saint, were displayed in the exercise, rather than in the acquisition, of his episcopal dignity. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1097"></A><A HREF="#fn_1096"><FONT SIZE="1">69</FONT></A> </p>

<p>     The vain and ambitious mind of Julian might aspire to restore the ancient glory of the temple of Jerusalem. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1098"></A><A HREF="#fn_1097"><FONT SIZE="1">70</FONT></A> As the Christians were firmly persuaded that a sentence of everlasting destruction had been pronounced against the whole fabric of the Mosaic law, the Imperial sophist would have converted the success of his undertaking into a specious argument against the faith of prophecy, and the truth of revelation. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1099"></A><A HREF="#fn_1098"><FONT SIZE="1">71</FONT></A> He was displeased with the spiritual worship of the synagogue; but he approved the institutions of Moses, who had not disdained to adopt many of the rites and ceremonies of Egypt. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1100"></A><A HREF="#fn_1099"><FONT SIZE="1">72</FONT></A> The local and national deity of the Jews was sincerely adored by a polytheist, who desired only to multiply the number of the gods; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1101"></A><A HREF="#fn_1100"><FONT SIZE="1">73</FONT></A> and such was the appetite of Julian for bloody sacrifice, that his emulation might be excited by the piety of Solomon, who had offered, at the feast of the dedication, twenty-two thousand oxen, and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1102"></A><A HREF="#fn_1101"><FONT SIZE="1">74</FONT></A> These considerations might influence his designs; but the prospect of an immediate and important advantage would not suffer the impatient monarch to expect the remote and uncertain event of the Persian war.  He resolved to erect, without delay, on the commanding eminence of Moriah, a stately temple, which might eclipse the splendor of the church of the resurrection on the adjacent hill of Calvary; to establish an order of priests, whose interested zeal would detect the arts, and resist the ambition, of their Christian rivals; and to invite a numerous colony of Jews, whose stern fanaticism would be always prepared to second, and even to anticipate, the hostile measures of the Pagan government. Among the friends of the emperor (if the names of emperor, and of friend, are not incompatible) the first place was assigned, by Julian himself, to the virtuous and learned Alypius. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1103"></A><A HREF="#fn_1102"><FONT SIZE="1">75</FONT></A> The humanity of Alypius was tempered by severe justice and manly fortitude; and while he exercised his abilities in the civil administration of Britain, he imitated, in his poetical compositions, the harmony and softness of the odes of Sappho. This minister, to whom Julian communicated, without reserve, his most careless levities, and his most serious counsels, received an extraordinary commission to restore, in its pristine beauty, the temple of Jerusalem; and the diligence of Alypius required and obtained the strenuous support of the governor of Palestine.  At the call of their great deliverer, the Jews, from all the provinces of the empire, assembled on the holy mountain of their fathers; and their insolent triumph alarmed and exasperated the Christian inhabitants of Jerusalem.  The desire of rebuilding the temple has in every age been the ruling passion of the children of Israel.  In this propitious moment the men forgot their avarice, and the women their delicacy; spades and pickaxes of silver were provided by the vanity of the rich, and the rubbish was transported in mantles of silk and purple.  Every purse was opened in liberal contributions, every hand claimed a share in the pious labor, and the commands of a great monarch were executed by the enthusiasm of a whole people. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1104"></A><A HREF="#fn_1103"><FONT SIZE="1">76</FONT></A> </p>

 </p> 
<p>     Yet, on this occasion, the joint efforts of power and enthusiasm were unsuccessful; and the ground of the Jewish temple, which is now covered by a Mahometan mosque, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1105"></A><A HREF="#fn_1104"><FONT SIZE="1">77</FONT></A> still continued to exhibit the same edifying spectacle of ruin and desolation.  Perhaps the absence and death of the emperor, and the new maxims of a Christian reign, might explain the interruption of an arduous work, which was attempted only in the last six months of the life of Julian. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1106"></A><A HREF="#fn_1105"><FONT SIZE="1">78</FONT></A> But the Christians entertained a natural and pious expectation, that, in this memorable contest, the honor of religion would be vindicated by some signal miracle.  An earthquake, a whirlwind, and a fiery eruption, which overturned and scattered the new foundations of the temple, are attested, with some variations, by contemporary and respectable evidence. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1107"></A><A HREF="#fn_1106"><FONT SIZE="1">79</FONT></A> This public event is described by Ambrose, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1108"></A><A HREF="#fn_1107"><FONT SIZE="1">80</FONT></A> bishop of Milan, in an epistle to the emperor Theodosius, which must provoke the severe animadversion of the Jews; by the eloquent Chrysostom, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1109"></A><A HREF="#fn_1108"><FONT SIZE="1">81</FONT></A> who might appeal to the memory of the elder part of his congregation at Antioch; and by Gregory Nazianzen, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1110"></A><A HREF="#fn_1109"><FONT SIZE="1">82</FONT></A> who published his account of the miracle before the expiration of the same year. The last of these writers has boldly declared, that this preternatural event was not disputed by the infidels; and his assertion, strange as it may seem is confirmed by the unexceptionable testimony of Ammianus Marcellinus. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1111"></A><A HREF="#fn_1110"><FONT SIZE="1">83</FONT></A> The philosophic soldier, who loved the virtues, without adopting the prejudices, of his master, has recorded, in his judicious and candid history of his own times, the extraordinary obstacles which interrupted the restoration of the temple of Jerusalem.  "Whilst Alypius, assisted by the governor of the province, urged, with vigor and diligence, the execution of the work, horrible balls of fire breaking out near the foundations, with frequent and reiterated attacks, rendered the place, from time to time, inaccessible to the scorched and blasted workmen; and the victorious element continuing in this manner obstinately and resolutely bent, as it were, to drive them to a distance, the undertaking was abandoned." &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1112"></A><A HREF="#fn_1111"><FONT SIZE="1">*_0056</FONT></A> Such authority should satisfy a believing, and must astonish an incredulous, mind.  Yet a philosopher may still require the original evidence of impartial and intelligent spectators.  At this important crisis, any singular accident of nature would assume the appearance, and produce the effects of a real prodigy.  This glorious deliverance would be speedily improved and magnified by the pious art of the clergy of Jerusalem, and the active credulity of the Christian world and, at the distance of twenty years, a Roman historian, care less of theological disputes, might adorn his work with the specious and splendid miracle. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1113"></A><A HREF="#fn_1112"><FONT SIZE="1">84</FONT></A> </p>

The same supernatural privilege must have been communicated to the Virgin's milk, (Erasmi Opera, tom. i. p. 778, Lugd. Batav. 1703, in Colloq. de Peregrinat.

Warburton labors (p. 60-90) to extort a confession of the miracle from the mouths of Julian and Libanius, and to employ the evidence of a rabbi who lived in the fifteenth century.  Such witnesses can only be received by a very favorable judge.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1111"></A><A HREF="daf02040.htm#fr_1112">*_0056</A> Michaelis has given an ingenious and sufficiently probable explanation of this remarkable incident, which the positive testimony of Ammianus, a contemporary and a pagan, will not permit us to call in question. It was suggested by a passage in Tacitus.  That historian, speaking of Jerusalem, says, [I omit the first part of the quotation adduced by M. Guizot, which only by a most extraordinary mistranslation of muri introrsus sinuati by "enfoncemens" could be made to bear on the question. - M.] The Temple itself was a kind of citadel, which had its own walls, superior in their workmanship and construction to those of the city. The porticos themselves, which surrounded the temple, were an excellent fortification.  There was a fountain of constantly running water; subterranean excavations under the mountain; reservoirs and cisterns to collect the rain-water." Tac. Hist. v. ii. 12. These excavations and reservoirs must have been very considerable.  The latter furnished water during the whole siege of Jerusalem to 1,100,000 inhabitants, for whom the fountain of Siloe could not have sufficed, and who had no fresh rain-water, the siege having taken place from the month of April to the month of August, a period of the year during which it rarely rains in Jerusalem.  As to the excavations, they served after, and even before, the return of the Jews from Babylon, to contain not only magazines of oil, wine, and corn, but also the treasures which were laid up in the Temple.  Josephus has related several incidents which show their extent.  When Jerusalem was on the point of being taken by Titus, the rebel chiefs, placing their last hopes in these vast subterranean cavities, formed a design of concealing themselves there, and remaining during the conflagration of the city, and until the Romans had retired to a distance.  The greater part had not time to execute their design; but one of them, Simon, the Son of Gioras, having provided himself with food, and tools to excavate the earth descended into this retreat with some companions: he remained there till Titus had set out for Rome: under the pressure of famine he issued forth on a sudden in the very place where the Temple had stood, and appeared in the midst of the Roman guard.  He was seized and carried to Rome for the triumph.  His appearance made it be suspected that other Jews might have chosen the same asylum; search was made, and a great number discovered. Joseph. de Bell. Jud. l. vii. c. 2.  It is probable that the greater part of these excavations were the remains of the time of Solomon, when it was the custom to work to a great extent under ground: no other date can be assigned to them.  The Jews, on their return from the captivity, were too poor to undertake such works; and, although Herod, on rebuilding the Temple, made some excavations, (Joseph. Ant. Jud. xv. 11, vii.,) the haste with which that building was completed will not allow us to suppose that they belonged to that period.  Some were used for sewers and drains, others served to conceal the immense treasures of which Crassus, a hundred and twenty years before, plundered the Jews, and which doubtless had been since replaced.  The Temple was destroyed A. C. 70; the attempt of Julian to rebuild it, and the fact related by Ammianus, coincide with the year 363. There had then elapsed between these two epochs an interval of near 300 years, during which the excavations, choked up with ruins, must have become full of inflammable air. The workmen employed by Julian as they were digging, arrived at the excavations of the Temple; they would take torches to explore them; sudden flames repelled those who approached; explosions were heard, and these phenomena were renewed every time that they penetrated into new subterranean passages. This explanation is confirmed by the relation of an event nearly similar, by Josephus.  King Herod having heard that immense treasures had been concealed in the sepulchre of David, he descended into it with a few confidential persons; he found in the first subterranean chamber only jewels and precious stuffs: but having wished to penetrate into a second chamber, which had been long closed, he was repelled, when he opened it, by flames which killed those who accompanied him.  (Ant. Jud. xvi. 7, i.) As here there is no room for miracle, this fact may be considered as a new proof of the veracity of that related by Ammianus and the contemporary writers. - G.       To the illustrations of the extent of the subterranean chambers adduced by Michaelis, may be added, that when John of Gischala, during the siege, surprised the Temple, the party of Eleazar took refuge within them. Bell. Jud. vi. 3, i.  The sudden sinking of the hill of Sion when Jerusalem was occupied by Barchocab, may have been connected with similar excavations.  Hist. of Jews, vol. iii. 122 and 186. - M.      It is a fact now popularly known, that when mines which have been long closed are opened, one of two things takes place; either the torches are extinguished and the men fall first into a swoor and soon die; or, if the air is inflammable, a little flame is seen to flicker round the lamp, which spreads and multiplies till the conflagration becomes general, is followed by an explosion, and kill all who are in the way. - G.</P>
