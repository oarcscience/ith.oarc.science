Part III.</h3> </p> 
<p>     But in the calmer moments of reflection, when the mind of Valens was not agitated by fear, or that of Valentinian by rage, the tyrant resumed the sentiments, or at least the conduct, of the father of his country.  The dispassionate judgment of the Western emperor could clearly perceive, and accurately pursue, his own and the public interest; and the sovereign of the East, who imitated with equal docility the various examples which he received from his elder brother, was sometimes guided by the wisdom and virtue of the praefect Sallust.  Both princes invariably retained, in the purple, the chaste and temperate simplicity which had adorned their private life; and, under their reign, the pleasures of the court never cost the people a blush or a sigh.  They gradually reformed many of the abuses of the times of Constantius; judiciously adopted and improved the designs of Julian and his successor; and displayed a style and spirit of legislation which might inspire posterity with the most favorable opinion of their character and government.  It is not from the master of Innocence, that we should expect the tender regard for the welfare of his subjects, which prompted Valentinian to condemn the exposition of new-born infants; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1395"></A><A HREF="#fn_1394"><FONT SIZE="1">60</FONT></A> and to establish fourteen skilful physicians, with stipends and privileges, in the fourteen quarters of Rome.  The good sense of an illiterate soldier founded a useful and liberal institution for the education of youth, and the support of declining science. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1396"></A><A HREF="#fn_1395"><FONT SIZE="1">61</FONT></A> It was his intention, that the arts of rhetoric and grammar should be taught in the Greek and Latin languages, in the metropolis of every province; and as the size and dignity of the school was usually proportioned to the importance of the city, the academies of Rome and Constantinople claimed a just and singular preeminence.  The fragments of the literary edicts of Valentinian imperfectly represent the school of Constantinople, which was gradually improved by subsequent regulations.  That school consisted of thirty-one professors in different branches of learning.  One philosopher, and two lawyers; five sophists, and ten grammarians for the Greek, and three orators, and ten grammarians for the Latin tongue; besides seven scribes, or, as they were then styled, antiquarians, whose laborious pens supplied the public library with fair and correct copies of the classic writers. The rule of conduct, which was prescribed to the students, is the more curious, as it affords the first outlines of the form and discipline of a modern university.  It was required, that they should bring proper certificates from the magistrates of their native province.  Their names, professions, and places of abode, were regularly entered in a public register.  The studious youth were severely prohibited from wasting their time in feasts, or in the theatre; and the term of their education was limited to the age of twenty.  The praefect of the city was empowered to chastise the idle and refractory by stripes or expulsion; and he was directed to make an annual report to the master of the offices, that the knowledge and abilities of the scholars might be usefully applied to the public service.  The institutions of Valentinian contributed to secure the benefits of peace and plenty; and the cities were guarded by the establishment of the Defensors; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1397"></A><A HREF="#fn_1396"><FONT SIZE="1">62</FONT></A> freely elected as the tribunes and advocates of the people, to support their rights, and to expose their grievances, before the tribunals of the civil magistrates, or even at the foot of the Imperial throne.  The finances were diligently administered by two princes, who had been so long accustomed to the rigid economy of a private fortune; but in the receipt and application of the revenue, a discerning eye might observe some difference between the government of the East and of the West.  Valens was persuaded, that royal liberality can be supplied only by public oppression, and his ambition never aspired to secure, by their actual distress, the future strength and prosperity of his people.  Instead of increasing the weight of taxes, which, in the space of forty years, had been gradually doubled, he reduced, in the first years of his reign, one fourth of the tribute of the East. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1398"></A><A HREF="#fn_1397"><FONT SIZE="1">63</FONT></A> Valentinian appears to have been less attentive and less anxious to relieve the burdens of his people.  He might reform the abuses of the fiscal administration; but he exacted, without scruple, a very large share of the private property; as he was convinced, that the revenues, which supported the luxury of individuals, would be much more advantageously employed for the defence and improvement of the state.  The subjects of the East, who enjoyed the present benefit, applauded the indulgence of their prince.  The solid but less splendid, merit of Valentinian was felt and acknowledged by the subsequent generation. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1399"></A><A HREF="#fn_1398"><FONT SIZE="1">64</FONT></A> </p>

 </p> 
<p>     But the most honorable circumstance of the character of Valentinian, is the firm and temperate impartiality which he uniformly preserved in an age of religious contention.  His strong sense, unenlightened, but uncorrupted, by study, declined, with respectful indifference, the subtle questions of theological debate.  The government of the Earth claimed his vigilance, and satisfied his ambition; and while he remembered that he was the disciple of the church, he never forgot that he was the sovereign of the clergy.  Under the reign of an apostate, he had signalized his zeal for the honor of Christianity: he allowed to his subjects the privilege which he had assumed for himself; and they might accept, with gratitude and confidence, the general toleration which was granted by a prince addicted to passion, but incapable of fear or of disguise. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1400"></A><A HREF="#fn_1399"><FONT SIZE="1">65</FONT></A> &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1401"></A><A HREF="#fn_1400"><FONT SIZE="1">*_0077</FONT></A> The Pagans, the Jews, and all the various sects which acknowledged the divine authority of Christ, were protected by the laws from arbitrary power or popular insult; nor was any mode of worship prohibited by Valentinian, except those secret and criminal practices, which abused the name of religion for the dark purposes of vice and disorder.  The art of magic, as it was more cruelly punished, was more strictly proscribed: but the emperor admitted a formal distinction to protect the ancient methods of divination, which were approved by the senate, and exercised by the Tuscan haruspices.  He had condemned, with the consent of the most rational Pagans, the license of nocturnal sacrifices; but he immediately admitted the petition of Praetextatus, proconsul of Achaia, who represented, that the life of the Greeks would become dreary and comfortless, if they were deprived of the invaluable blessing of the Eleusinian mysteries.  Philosophy alone can boast, (and perhaps it is no more than the boast of philosophy,) that her gentle hand is able to eradicate from the human mind the latent and deadly principle of fanaticism.  But this truce of twelve years, which was enforced by the wise and vigorous government of Valentinian, by suspending the repetition of mutual injuries, contributed to soften the manners, and abate the prejudices, of the religious factions. </p> 
<p>
  
 </p> 
<p>     The friend of toleration was unfortunately placed at a distance from the scene of the fiercest controversies.  As soon as the Christians of the West had extricated themselves from the snares of the creed of Rimini, they happily relapsed into the slumber of orthodoxy; and the small remains of the Arian party, that still subsisted at Sirmium or Milan, might be considered rather as objects of contempt than of resentment.  But in the provinces of the East, from the Euxine to the extremity of Thebais, the strength and numbers of the hostile factions were more equally balanced; and this equality, instead of recommending the counsels of peace, served only to perpetuate the horrors of religious war.  The monks and bishops supported their arguments by invectives; and their invectives were sometimes followed by blows.  Athanasius still reigned at Alexandria; the thrones of Constantinople and Antioch were occupied by Arian prelates, and every episcopal vacancy was the occasion of a popular tumult.  The Homoousians were fortified by the reconciliation of fifty-nine Macelonian, or Semi-Arian, bishops; but their secret reluctance to embrace the divinity of the Holy Ghost, clouded the splendor of the triumph; and the declaration of Valens, who, in the first years of his reign, had imitated the impartial conduct of his brother, was an important victory on the side of Arianism. The two brothers had passed their private life in the condition of catechumens; but the piety of Valens prompted him to solicit the sacrament of baptism, before he exposed his person to the dangers of a Gothic war. He naturally addressed himself to Eudoxus, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1402"></A><A HREF="#fn_1401"><FONT SIZE="1">66</FONT></A> &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1403"></A><A HREF="#fn_1402"><FONT SIZE="1">*_0078</FONT></A> bishop of the Imperial city; and if the ignorant monarch was instructed by that Arian pastor in the principles of heterodox theology, his misfortune, rather than his guilt, was the inevitable consequence of his erroneous choice.  Whatever had been the determination of the emperor, he must have offended a numerous party of his Christian subjects; as the leaders both of the Homoousians and of the Arians believed, that, if they were not suffered to reign, they were most cruelly injured and oppressed.  After he had taken this decisive step, it was extremely difficult for him to preserve either the virtue, or the reputation of impartiality.  He never aspired, like Constantius, to the fame of a profound theologian; but as he had received with simplicity and respect the tenets of Euxodus, Valens resigned his conscience to the direction of his ecclesiastical guides, and promoted, by the influence of his authority, the reunion of the Athanasian heretics to the body of the Catholic church.  At first, he pitied their blindness; by degrees he was provoked at their obstinacy; and he insensibly hated those sectaries to whom he was an object of hatred. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1404"></A><A HREF="#fn_1403"><FONT SIZE="1">67</FONT></A> The feeble mind of Valens was always swayed by the persons with whom he familiarly conversed; and the exile or imprisonment of a private citizen are the favors the most readily granted in a despotic court.  Such punishments were frequently inflicted on the leaders of the Homoousian party; and the misfortune of fourscore ecclesiastics of Constantinople, who, perhaps accidentally, were burned on shipboard, was imputed to the cruel and premeditated malice of the emperor, and his Arian ministers.  In every contest, the Catholics (if we may anticipate that name) were obliged to pay the penalty of their own faults, and of those of their adversaries.  In every election, the claims of the Arian candidate obtained the preference; and if they were opposed by the majority of the people, he was usually supported by the authority of the civil magistrate, or even by the terrors of a military force.  The enemies of Athanasius attempted to disturb the last years of his venerable age; and his temporary retreat to his father's sepulchre has been celebrated as a fifth exile.  But the zeal of a great people, who instantly flew to arms, intimidated the praefect: and the archbishop was permitted to end his life in peace and in glory, after a reign of forty-seven years.  The death of Athanasius was the signal of the persecution of Egypt; and the Pagan minister of Valens, who forcibly seated the worthless Lucius on the archiepiscopal throne, purchased the favor of the reigning party, by the blood and sufferings of their Christian brethren.  The free toleration of the heathen and Jewish worship was bitterly lamented, as a circumstance which aggravated the misery of the Catholics, and the guilt of the impious tyrant of the East. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1405"></A><A HREF="#fn_1404"><FONT SIZE="1">68</FONT></A> </p>

<p>
  
       The triumph of the orthodox party has left a deep stain of persecution on the memory of Valens; and the character of a prince who derived his virtues, as well as his vices, from a feeble understanding and a pusillanimous temper, scarcely deserves the labor of an apology.  Yet candor may discover some reasons to suspect that the ecclesiastical ministers of Valens often exceeded the orders, or even the intentions, of their master; and that the real measure of facts has been very liberally magnified by the vehement declamation and easy credulity of his antagonists. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1406"></A><A HREF="#fn_1405"><FONT SIZE="1">69</FONT></A> 1. The silence of Valentinian may suggest a probable argument that the partial severities, which were exercised in the name and provinces of his colleague, amounted only to some obscure and inconsiderable deviations from the established system of religious toleration: and the judicious historian, who has praised the equal temper of the elder brother, has not thought himself obliged to contrast the tranquillity of the West with the cruel persecution of the East. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1407"></A><A HREF="#fn_1406"><FONT SIZE="1">70</FONT></A> 2. Whatever credit may be allowed to vague and distant reports, the character, or at least the behavior, of Valens, may be most distinctly seen in his personal transactions with the eloquent Basil, archbishop of Caesarea, who had succeeded Athanasius in the management of the Trinitarian cause. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1408"></A><A HREF="#fn_1407"><FONT SIZE="1">71</FONT></A> The circumstantial narrative has been composed by the friends and admirers of Basil; and as soon as we have stripped away a thick coat of rhetoric and miracle, we shall be astonished by the unexpected mildness of the Arian tyrant, who admired the firmness of his character, or was apprehensive, if he employed violence, of a general revolt in the province of Cappadocia. The archbishop, who asserted, with inflexible pride, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1409"></A><A HREF="#fn_1408"><FONT SIZE="1">72</FONT></A> the truth of his opinions, and the dignity of his rank, was left in the free possession of his conscience and his throne.  The emperor devoutly assisted at the solemn service of the cathedral; and, instead of a sentence of banishment, subscribed the donation of a valuable estate for the use of a hospital, which Basil had lately founded in the neighborhood of Caesarea. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1410"></A><A HREF="#fn_1409"><FONT SIZE="1">73</FONT></A> 3. I am not able to discover, that any law (such as Theodosius afterwards enacted against the Arians) was published by Valens against the Athanasian sectaries; and the edict which excited the most violent clamors, may not appear so extremely reprehensible.  The emperor had observed, that several of his subjects, gratifying their lazy disposition under the pretence of religion, had associated themselves with the monks of Egypt; and he directed the count of the East to drag them from their solitude; and to compel these deserters of society to accept the fair alternative of renouncing their temporal possessions, or of discharging the public duties of men and citizens. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1411"></A><A HREF="#fn_1410"><FONT SIZE="1">74</FONT></A> The ministers of Valens seem to have extended the sense of this penal statute, since they claimed a right of enlisting the young and ablebodied monks in the Imperial armies.  A detachment of cavalry and infantry, consisting of three thousand men, marched from Alexandria into the adjacent desert of Nitria, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1412"></A><A HREF="#fn_1411"><FONT SIZE="1">75</FONT></A> which was peopled by five thousand monks.  The soldiers were conducted by Arian priests; and it is reported, that a considerable slaughter was made in the monasteries which disobeyed the commands of their sovereign. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1413"></A><A HREF="#fn_1412"><FONT SIZE="1">76</FONT></A> </p>

       The strict regulations which have been framed by the wisdom of modern legislators to restrain the wealth and avarice of the clergy, may be originally deduced from the example of the emperor Valentinian.  His edict, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1414"></A><A HREF="#fn_1413"><FONT SIZE="1">77</FONT></A> addressed to Damasus, bishop of Rome, was publicly read in the churches of the city.  He admonished the ecclesiastics and monks not to frequent the houses of widows and virgins; and menaced their disobedience with the animadversion of the civil judge.  The director was no longer permitted to receive any gift, or legacy, or inheritance, from the liberality of his spiritual-daughter: every testament contrary to this edict was declared null and void; and the illegal donation was confiscated for the use of the treasury.  By a subsequent regulation, it should seem, that the same provisions were extended to nuns and bishops; and that all persons of the ecclesiastical order were rendered incapable of receiving any testamentary gifts, and strictly confined to the natural and legal rights of inheritance. As the guardian of domestic happiness and virtue, Valentinian applied this severe remedy to the growing evil.  In the capital of the empire, the females of noble and opulent houses possessed a very ample share of independent property: and many of those devout females had embraced the doctrines of Christianity, not only with the cold assent of the understanding, but with the warmth of affection, and perhaps with the eagerness of fashion.  They sacrificed the pleasures of dress and luxury; and renounced, for the praise of chastity, the soft endearments of conjugal society.  Some ecclesiastic, of real or apparent sanctity, was chosen to direct their timorous conscience, and to amuse the vacant tenderness of their heart: and the unbounded confidence, which they hastily bestowed, was often abused by knaves and enthusiasts; who hastened from the extremities of the East, to enjoy, on a splendid theatre, the privileges of the monastic profession.  By their contempt of the world, they insensibly acquired its most desirable advantages; the lively attachment, perhaps of a young and beautiful woman, the delicate plenty of an opulent household, and the respectful homage of the slaves, the freedmen, and the clients of a senatorial family.  The immense fortunes of the Roman ladies were gradually consumed in lavish alms and expensive pilgrimages; and the artful monk, who had assigned himself the first, or possibly the sole place, in the testament of his spiritual daughter, still presumed to declare, with the smooth face of hypocrisy, that he was only the instrument of charity, and the steward of the poor.  The lucrative, but disgraceful, trade, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1415"></A><A HREF="#fn_1414"><FONT SIZE="1">78</FONT></A> which was exercised by the clergy to defraud the expectations of the natural heirs, had provoked the indignation of a superstitious age: and two of the most respectable of the Latin fathers very honestly confess, that the ignominious edict of Valentinian was just and necessary; and that the Christian priests had deserved to lose a privilege, which was still enjoyed by comedians, charioteers, and the ministers of idols.  But the wisdom and authority of the legislator are seldom victorious in a contest with the vigilant dexterity of private interest; and Jerom, or Ambrose, might patiently acquiesce in the justice of an ineffectual or salutary law.  If the ecclesiastics were checked in the pursuit of personal emolument, they would exert a more laudable industry to increase the wealth of the church; and dignify their covetousness with the specious names of piety and patriotism. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1416"></A><A HREF="#fn_1415"><FONT SIZE="1">79</FONT></A> </p> 
<p>
  
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>    Damasus, bishop of Rome, who was constrained to stigmatize the avarice of his clergy by the publication of the law of Valentinian, had the good sense, or the good fortune, to engage in his service the zeal and abilities of the learned Jerom; and the grateful saint has celebrated the merit and purity of a very ambiguous character. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1417"></A><A HREF="#fn_1416"><FONT SIZE="1">80</FONT></A> But the splendid vices of the church of Rome, under the reign of Valentinian and Damasus, have been curiously observed by the historian Ammianus, who delivers his impartial sense in these expressive words: "The praefecture of Juventius was accompanied with peace and plenty, but the tranquillity of his government was soon disturbed by a bloody sedition of the distracted people.  The ardor of Damasus and Ursinus, to seize the episcopal seat, surpassed the ordinary measure of human ambition.  They contended with the rage of party; the quarrel was maintained by the wounds and death of their followers; and the praefect, unable to resist or appease the tumult, was constrained, by superior violence, to retire into the suburbs. Damasus prevailed: the well-disputed victory remained on the side of his faction; one hundred and thirty-seven dead bodies &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1418"></A><A HREF="#fn_1417"><FONT SIZE="1">81</FONT></A> were found in the Basilica of Sicininus, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1419"></A><A HREF="#fn_1418"><FONT SIZE="1">82</FONT></A> where the Christians hold their religious assemblies; and it was long before the angry minds of the people resumed their accustomed tranquillity. When I consider the splendor of the capital, I am not astonished that so valuable a prize should inflame the desires of ambitious men, and produce the fiercest and most obstinate contests.  The successful candidate is secure, that he will be enriched by the offerings of matrons; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1420"></A><A HREF="#fn_1419"><FONT SIZE="1">83</FONT></A> that, as soon as his dress is composed with becoming care and elegance, he may proceed, in his chariot, through the streets of Rome; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1421"></A><A HREF="#fn_1420"><FONT SIZE="1">84</FONT></A> and that the sumptuousness of the Imperial table will not equal the profuse and delicate entertainments provided by the taste, and at the expense, of the Roman pontiffs.  How much more rationally (continues the honest Pagan) would those pontiffs consult their true happiness, if, instead of alleging the greatness of the city as an excuse for their manners, they would imitate the exemplary life of some provincial bishops, whose temperance and sobriety, whose mean apparel and downcast looks, recommend their pure and modest virtue to the Deity and his true worshippers!" &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1422"></A><A HREF="#fn_1421"><FONT SIZE="1">85</FONT></A> The schism of Damasus and Ursinus was extinguished by the exile of the latter; and the wisdom of the praefect Praetextatus &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1423"></A><A HREF="#fn_1422"><FONT SIZE="1">86</FONT></A> restored the tranquillity of the city.  Praetextatus was a philosophic Pagan, a man of learning, of taste, and politeness; who disguised a reproach in the form of a jest, when he assured Damasus, that if he could obtain the bishopric of Rome, he himself would immediately embrace the Christian religion. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1424"></A><A HREF="#fn_1423"><FONT SIZE="1">87</FONT></A> This lively picture of the wealth and luxury of the popes in the fourth century becomes the more curious, as it represents the intermediate degree between the humble poverty of the apostolic fishermen, and the royal state of a temporal prince, whose dominions extend from the confines of Naples to the banks of the Po. </p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1408"></A><A HREF="daf02050.htm#fr_1409">72</A> Basilius Caesariensis episcopus Cappadociae clarus habetur ... qui multa continentiae et ingenii bona uno superbiae malo perdidit. This irreverent passage is perfectly in the style and character of St. Jerom.  It does not appear in Scaliger's edition of his Chronicle; but Isaac Vossius found it in some old Mss. which had not been reformed by the monks.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1409"></A><A HREF="daf02050.htm#fr_1410">73</A> This noble and charitable foundation (almost a new city) surpassed in merit, if not in greatness, the pyramids, or the walls of Babylon.  It was principally intended for the reception of lepers, (Greg. Nazianzen, Orat. xx. p. 439.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1410"></A><A HREF="daf02050.htm#fr_1411">74</A> Cod. Theodos. l. xii. tit. i. leg. 63.  Godefroy (tom. iv. p. 409-413) performs the duty of a commentator and advocate.  Tillemont (Mem. Eccles. tom. viii. p. 808) supposes a second law to excuse his orthodox friends, who had misrepresented the edict of Valens, and suppressed the liberty of choice.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1411"></A><A HREF="daf02050.htm#fr_1412">75</A> See D'Anville, Description de l'Egypte, p. 74.  Hereafter I shall consider the monastic institutions.</P>

The monks of Egypt performed many miracles, which prove the truth of their faith.  Right, says Jortin, (Remarks, vol iv. p. 79,) but what proves the truth of those miracles.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1413"></A><A HREF="daf02050.htm#fr_1414">77</A> Cod. Theodos. l. xvi. tit. ii. leg. 20.  Godefroy, (tom. vi. p. 49,) after the example of Baronius, impartially collects all that the fathers have said on the subject of this important law; whose spirit was long afterwards revived by the emperor Frederic II., Edward I. of England, and other Christian princes who reigned after the twelfth century.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1414"></A><A HREF="daf02050.htm#fr_1415">78</A> The expressions which I have used are temperate and feeble, if compared with the vehement invectives of Jerom, (tom. i. p. 13, 45, 144, &c.) In his turn he was reproached with the guilt which he imputed to his brother monks; and the Sceleratus, the Versipellis, was publicly accused as the lover of the widow Paula, (tom. ii. p. 363.) He undoubtedly possessed the affection, both of the mother and the daughter; but he declares that he never abused his influence to any selfish or sensual purpose.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1415"></A><A HREF="daf02050.htm#fr_1416">79</A> Pudet dicere, sacerdotes idolorum, mimi et aurigae, et scorta, haereditates capiunt: solis clericis ac monachis hac lege prohibetur.  Et non prohibetur a persecutoribus, sed a principibus Christianis.  Nec de lege queror; sed doleo cur meruerimus hanc legem. Jerom (tom. i. p. 13) discreetly insinuates the secret policy of his patron Damasus.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1416"></A><A HREF="daf02050.htm#fr_1417">80</A> Three words of Jerom, sanctoe memorioe Damasus (tom. ii. p. 109,) wash away all his stains, and blind the devout eyes of Tillemont. (Mem Eccles. tom. viii. p. 386-424.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1417"></A><A HREF="daf02050.htm#fr_1418">81</A> Jerom himself is forced to allow, crudelissimae interfectiones diversi sexus perpetratae, (in Chron. p. 186.) But an original libel, or petition of two presbyters of the adverse party, has unaccountably escaped. They affirm that the doors of the Basilica were burnt, and that the roof was untiled; that Damasus marched at the head of his own clergy, grave-diggers, charioteers, and hired gladiators; that none of his party were killed, but that one hundred and sixty dead bodies were found.  This petition is published by the P. Sirmond, in the first volume of his work.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1419"></A><A HREF="daf02050.htm#fr_1420">83</A> The enemies of Damasus styled him Auriscalpius Matronarum the ladies' ear-scratcher.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1420"></A><A HREF="daf02050.htm#fr_1421">84</A> Gregory Nazianzen (Orat. xxxii. p. 526) describes the pride and luxury of the prelates who reigned in the Imperial cities; their gilt car, fiery steeds, numerous train, &c.  The crowd gave way as to a wild beast.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1422"></A><A HREF="daf02050.htm#fr_1423">86</A> Ammianus, who makes a fair report of his praefecture (xxvii. 9) styles him praeclarae indolis, gravitatisque senator, (xxii. 7, and Vales. ad loc.) A curious inscription (Grutor MCII. No. 2) records, in two columns, his religious and civil honors.  In one line he was Pontiff of the Sun, and of Vesta, Augur, Quindecemvir, Hierophant, &c., &c.  In the other, 1. Quaestor candidatus, more probably titular.  2. Praetor.  3. Corrector of Tuscany and Umbria.  4. Consular of Lusitania.  5. Proconsul of Achaia. 6. Praefect of Rome.  7. Praetorian praefect of Italy.  8. Of Illyricum. 9. Consul elect; but he died before the beginning of the year 385.  See Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom v. p. 241, 736.</P>
