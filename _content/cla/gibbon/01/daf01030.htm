Part II.</h3> </p> 
<p>     The Goths were now in possession of the Ukraine, a country of considerable extent and uncommon fertility, intersected with navigable rivers, which, from either side, discharge themselves into the Borysthenes; and interspersed with large and leafy forests of oaks.  The plenty of game and fish, the innumerable bee-hives deposited in the hollow of old trees, and in the cavities of rocks, and forming, even in that rude age, a valuable branch of commerce, the size of the cattle, the temperature of the air, the aptness of the soil for every species of gain, and the luxuriancy of the vegetation, all displayed the liberality of Nature, and tempted the industry of man. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_837"></A><A HREF="#fn_837"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A> But the Goths withstood all these temptations, and still adhered to a life of idleness, of poverty, and of rapine. </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>     The Scythian hordes, which, towards the east, bordered on the new settlements of the Goths, presented nothing to their arms, except the doubtful chance of an unprofitable victory.  But the prospect of the Roman territories was far more alluring; and the fields of Dacia were covered with rich harvests, sown by the hands of an industrious, and exposed to be gathered by those of a warlike, people.  It is probable that the conquests of Trajan, maintained by his successors, less for any real advantage than for ideal dignity, had contributed to weaken the empire on that side.  The new and unsettled province of Dacia was neither strong enough to resist, nor rich enough to satiate, the rapaciousness of the barbarians.  As long as the remote banks of the Niester were considered as the boundary of the Roman power, the fortifications of the Lower Danube were more carelessly guarded, and the inhabitants of Maesia lived in supine security, fondly conceiving themselves at an inaccessible distance from any barbarian invaders.  The irruptions of the Goths, under the reign of Philip, fatally convinced them of their mistake.  The king, or leader, of that fierce nation, traversed with contempt the province of Dacia, and passed both the Niester and the Danube without encountering any opposition capable of retarding his progress.  The relaxed discipline of the Roman troops betrayed the most important posts, where they were stationed, and the fear of deserved punishment induced great numbers of them to enlist under the Gothic standard.  The various multitude of barbarians appeared, at length, under the walls of Marcianopolis, a city built by Trajan in honor of his sister, and at that time the capital of the second Maesia. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_838"></A><A HREF="#fn_838"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A> The inhabitants consented to ransom their lives and property by the payment of a large sum of money, and the invaders retreated back into their deserts, animated, rather than satisfied, with the first success of their arms against an opulent but feeble country.  Intelligence was soon transmitted to the emperor Decius, that Cniva, king of the Goths, had passed the Danube a second time, with more considerable forces; that his numerous detachments scattered devastation over the province of Maesia, whilst the main body of the army, consisting of seventy thousand Germans and Sarmatians, a force equal to the most daring achievements, required the presence of the Roman monarch, and the exertion of his military power.  
 </p> 
<p>     Decius found the Goths engaged before Nicopolis, one of the many monuments of Trajan's victories. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_839"></A><A HREF="#fn_839"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A> On his approach they raised the siege, but with a design only of marching away to a conquest of greater importance, the siege of Philippopolis, a city of Thrace, founded by the father of Alexander, near the foot of Mount Haemus. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_840"></A><A HREF="#fn_840"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A> Decius followed them through a difficult country, and by forced marches; but when he imagined himself at a considerable distance from the rear of the Goths, Cniva turned with rapid fury on his pursuers.  The camp of the Romans was surprised and pillaged, and, for the first time, their emperor fled in disorder before a troop of half-armed barbarians.  After a long resistance, Philoppopolis, destitute of succor, was taken by storm.  A hundred thousand persons are reported to have been massacred in the sack of that great city. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_841"></A><A HREF="#fn_841"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A> Many prisoners of consequence became a valuable accession to the spoil; and Priscus, a brother of the late emperor Philip, blushed not to assume the purple, under the protection of the barbarous enemies of Rome. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_842"></A><A HREF="#fn_842"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A> The time, however, consumed in that tedious siege, enabled Decius to revive the courage, restore the discipline, and recruit the numbers of his troops.  He intercepted several parties of Carpi, and other Germans, who were hastening to share the victory of their countrymen, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_843"></A><A HREF="#fn_843"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A> intrusted the passes of the mountains to officers of approved valor and fidelity, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_844"></A><A HREF="#fn_844"><FONT SIZE="1">35</FONT></A> repaired and strengthened the fortifications of the Danube, and exerted his utmost vigilance to oppose either the progress or the retreat of the Goths. Encouraged by the return of fortune, he anxiously waited for an opportunity to retrieve, by a great and decisive blow, his own glory, and that of the Roman arms. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_845"></A><A HREF="#fn_845"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A> </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>

 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
  
       At the same time when Decius was struggling with the violence of the tempest, his mind, calm and deliberate amidst the tumult of war, investigated the more general causes, that, since the age of the Antonines, had so impetuously urged the decline of the Roman greatness.  He soon discovered that it was impossible to replace that greatness on a permanent basis, without restoring public virtue, ancient principles and manners, and the oppressed majesty of the laws.  To execute this noble but arduous design, he first resolved to revive the obsolete office of censor; an office which, as long as it had subsisted in its pristine integrity, had so much contributed to the perpetuity of the state, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_846"></A><A HREF="#fn_846"><FONT SIZE="1">37</FONT></A> till it was usurped and gradually neglected by the Caesars. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_847"></A><A HREF="#fn_847"><FONT SIZE="1">38</FONT></A> Conscious that the favor of the sovereign may confer power, but that the esteem of the people can alone bestow authority, he submitted the choice of the censor to the unbiased voice of the senate. By their unanimous votes, or rather acclamations, Valerian, who was afterwards emperor, and who then served with distinction in the army of Decius, was declared the most worthy of that exalted honor.  As soon as the decree of the senate was transmitted to the emperor, he assembled a great council in his camp, and before the investiture of the censor elect, he apprised him of the difficulty and importance of his great office.  "Happy Valerian," said the prince to his distinguished subject, "happy in the general approbation of the senate and of the Roman republic!  Accept the censorship of mankind; and judge of our manners.  You will select those who deserve to continue members of the senate; you will restore the equestrian order to its ancient splendor; you will improve the revenue, yet moderate the public burdens.  You will distinguish into regular classes the various and infinite multitude of citizens, and accurately view the military strength, the wealth, the virtue, and the resources of Rome.  Your decisions shall obtain the force of laws.  The army, the palace, the ministers of justice, and the great officers of the empire, are all subject to your tribunal.  None are exempted, excepting only the ordinary consuls, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_848"></A><A HREF="#fn_848"><FONT SIZE="1">39</FONT></A> the praefect of the city, the king of the sacrifices, and (as long as she preserves her chastity inviolate) the eldest of the vestal virgins.  Even these few, who may not dread the severity, will anxiously solicit the esteem, of the Roman censor." &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_849"></A><A HREF="#fn_849"><FONT SIZE="1">40</FONT></A> </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
       A magistrate, invested with such extensive powers, would have appeared not so much the minister, as the colleague of his sovereign. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_850"></A><A HREF="#fn_850"><FONT SIZE="1">41</FONT></A> Valerian justly dreaded an elevation so full of envy and of suspicion.  He modestly argued the alarming greatness of the trust, his own insufficiency, and the incurable corruption of the times.  He artfully insinuated, that the office of censor was inseparable from the Imperial dignity, and that the feeble hands of a subject were unequal to the support of such an immense weight of cares and of power. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_851"></A><A HREF="#fn_851"><FONT SIZE="1">42</FONT></A> The approaching event of war soon put an end to the prosecution of a project so specious, but so impracticable; and whilst it preserved Valerian from the danger, saved the emperor Decius from the disappointment, which would most probably have attended it.  A censor may maintain, he can never restore, the morals of a state.  It is impossible for such a magistrate to exert his authority with benefit, or even with effect, unless he is supported by a quick sense of honor and virtue in the minds of the people, by a decent reverence for the public opinion, and by a train of useful prejudices combating on the side of national manners.  In a period when these principles are annihilated, the censorial jurisdiction must either sink into empty pageantry, or be converted into a partial instrument of vexatious oppression. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_852"></A><A HREF="#fn_852"><FONT SIZE="1">43</FONT></A> It was easier to vanquish the Goths than to eradicate the public vices; yet even in the first of these enterprises, Decius lost his army and his life. </p> 
<p>
  
  
 </p> 
<p>     The Goths were now, on every side, surrounded and pursued by the Roman arms.  The flower of their troops had perished in the long siege of Philippopolis, and the exhausted country could no longer afford subsistence for the remaining multitude of licentious barbarians.  Reduced to this extremity, the Goths would gladly have purchased, by the surrender of all their booty and prisoners, the permission of an undisturbed retreat.  But the emperor, confident of victory, and resolving, by the chastisement of these invaders, to strike a salutary terror into the nations of the North, refused to listen to any terms of accommodation.  The high-spirited barbarians preferred death to slavery.  An obscure town of Maesia, called Forum Terebronii, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_853"></A><A HREF="#fn_853"><FONT SIZE="1">44</FONT></A> was the scene of the battle.  The Gothic army was drawn up in three lines, and either from choice or accident, the front of the third line was covered by a morass.  In the beginning of the action, the son of Decius, a youth of the fairest hopes, and already associated to the honors of the purple, was slain by an arrow, in the sight of his afflicted father; who, summoning all his fortitude, admonished the dismayed troops, that the loss of a single soldier was of little importance to the republic. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_854"></A><A HREF="#fn_854"><FONT SIZE="1">45</FONT></A> The conflict was terrible; it was the combat of despair against grief and rage.  The first line of the Goths at length gave way in disorder; the second, advancing to sustain it, shared its fate; and the third only remained entire, prepared to dispute the passage of the morass, which was imprudently attempted by the presumption of the enemy.  "Here the fortune of the day turned, and all things became adverse to the Romans; the place deep with ooze, sinking under those who stood, slippery to such as advanced; their armor heavy, the waters deep; nor could they wield, in that uneasy situation, their weighty javelins. The barbarians, on the contrary, were inured to encounter in the bogs, their persons tall, their spears long, such as could wound at a distance." &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_855"></A><A HREF="#fn_855"><FONT SIZE="1">46</FONT></A> In this morass the Roman army, after an ineffectual struggle, was irrecoverably lost; nor could the body of the emperor ever be found. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_856"></A><A HREF="#fn_856"><FONT SIZE="1">47</FONT></A> Such was the fate of Decius, in the fiftieth year of his age; an accomplished prince, active in war and affable in peace; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_857"></A><A HREF="#fn_857"><FONT SIZE="1">48</FONT></A> who, together with his son, has deserved to be compared, both in life and death, with the brightest examples of ancient virtue. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_858"></A><A HREF="#fn_858"><FONT SIZE="1">49</FONT></A> </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
  
  
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>     This fatal blow humbled, for a very little time, she insolence of the legions.  They appeared to have patiently expected, and submissively obeyed, the decree of the senate which regulated the succession to the throne.  From a just regard for the memory of Decius, the Imperial title was conferred on Hostilianus, his only surviving son; but an equal rank, with more effectual power, was granted to Gallus, whose experience and ability seemed equal to the great trust of guardian to the young prince and the distressed empire. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_859"></A><A HREF="#fn_859"><FONT SIZE="1">50</FONT></A> The first care of the new emperor was to deliver the Illyrian provinces from the intolerable weight of the victorious Goths.  He consented to leave in their hands the rich fruits of their invasion, an immense booty, and what was still more disgraceful, a great number of prisoners of the highest merit and quality.  He plentifully supplied their camp with every conveniency that could assuage their angry spirits or facilitate their so much wished-for departure; and he even promised to pay them annually a large sum of gold, on condition they should never afterwards infest the Roman territories by their incursions. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_860"></A><A HREF="#fn_860"><FONT SIZE="1">51</FONT></A> </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>     In the age of the Scipios, the most opulent kings of the earth, who courted the protection of the victorious commonwealth, were gratified with such trifling presents as could only derive a value from the hand that bestowed them; an ivory chair, a coarse garment of purple, an inconsiderable piece of plate, or a quantity of copper coin. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_861"></A><A HREF="#fn_861"><FONT SIZE="1">52</FONT></A> After the wealth of nations had centred in Rome, the emperors displayed their greatness, and even their policy, by the regular exercise of a steady and moderate liberality towards the allies of the state.  They relieved the poverty of the barbarians, honored their merit, and recompensed their fidelity.  These voluntary marks of bounty were understood to flow, not from the fears, but merely from the generosity or the gratitude of the Romans; and whilst presents and subsidies were liberally distributed among friends and suppliants, they were sternly refused to such as claimed them as a debt. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_862"></A><A HREF="#fn_862"><FONT SIZE="1">53</FONT></A> But this stipulation, of an annual payment to a victorious enemy, appeared without disguise in the light of an ignominious tribute; the minds of the Romans were not yet accustomed to accept such unequal laws from a tribe of barbarians; and the prince, who by a necessary concession had probably saved his country, became the object of the general contempt and aversion.  The death of Hostiliamus, though it happened in the midst of a raging pestilence, was interpreted as the personal crime of Gallus; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_863"></A><A HREF="#fn_863"><FONT SIZE="1">54</FONT></A> and even the defeat of the later emperor was ascribed by the voice of suspicion to the perfidious counsels of his hated successor. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_864"></A><A HREF="#fn_864"><FONT SIZE="1">55</FONT></A> The tranquillity which the empire enjoyed during the first year of his administration, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_865"></A><A HREF="#fn_865"><FONT SIZE="1">56</FONT></A> served rather to inflame than to appease the public discontent; and as soon as the apprehensions of war were removed, the infamy of the peace was more deeply and more sensibly felt. </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
  
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
       But the Romans were irritated to a still higher degree, when they discovered that they had not even secured their repose, though at the expense of their honor.  The dangerous secret of the wealth and weakness of the empire had been revealed to the world.  New swarms of barbarians, encouraged by the success, and not conceiving themselves bound by the obligation of their brethren, spread devastation though the Illyrian provinces, and terror as far as the gates of Rome.  The defence of the monarchy, which seemed abandoned by the pusillanimous emperor, was assumed by Aemilianus, governor of Pannonia and Maesia; who rallied the scattered forces, and revived the fainting spirits of the troops.  The barbarians were unexpectedly attacked, routed, chased, and pursued beyond the Danube.  The victorious leader distributed as a donative the money collected for the tribute, and the acclamations of the soldiers proclaimed him emperor on the field of battle. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_866"></A><A HREF="#fn_866"><FONT SIZE="1">57</FONT></A> Gallus, who, careless of the general welfare, indulged himself in the pleasures of Italy, was almost in the same instant informed of the success, of the revolt, and of the rapid approach of his aspiring lieutenant.  He advanced to meet him as far as the plains of Spoleto.  When the armies came in right of each other, the soldiers of Gallus compared the ignominious conduct of their sovereign with the glory of his rival.  They admired the valor of Aemilianus; they were attracted by his liberality, for he offered a considerable increase of pay to all deserters. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_867"></A><A HREF="#fn_867"><FONT SIZE="1">58</FONT></A> The murder of Gallus, and of his son Volusianus, put an end to the civil war; and the senate gave a legal sanction to the rights of conquest.  The letters of Aemilianus to that assembly displayed a mixture of moderation and vanity.  He assured them, that he should resign to their wisdom the civil administration; and, contenting himself with the quality of their general, would in a short time assert the glory of Rome, and deliver the empire from all the barbarians both of the North and of the East. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_868"></A><A HREF="#fn_868"><FONT SIZE="1">59</FONT></A> His pride was flattered by the applause of the senate; and medals are still extant, representing him with the name and attributes of Hercules the Victor, and Mars the Avenger. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_869"></A><A HREF="#fn_869"><FONT SIZE="1">60</FONT></A>  
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>     If the new monarch possessed the abilities, he wanted the time, necessary to fulfil these splendid promises.  Less than four months intervened between his victory and his fall. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_870"></A><A HREF="#fn_870"><FONT SIZE="1">61</FONT></A> He had vanquished Gallus: he sunk under the weight of a competitor more formidable than Gallus.  That unfortunate prince had sent Valerian, already distinguished by the honorable title of censor, to bring the legions of Gaul and Germany &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_871"></A><A HREF="#fn_871"><FONT SIZE="1">62</FONT></A> to his aid. Valerian executed that commission with zeal and fidelity; and as he arrived too late to save his sovereign, he resolved to revenge him.  The troops of Aemilianus, who still lay encamped in the plains of Spoleto, were awed by the sanctity of his character, but much more by the superior strength of his army; and as they were now become as incapable of personal attachment as they had always been of constitutional principle, they readily imbrued their hands in the blood of a prince who so lately had been the object of their partial choice.  The guilt was theirs, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_872"></A><A HREF="#fn_872"><FONT SIZE="1">*_0075</FONT></A> but the advantage of it was Valerian's; who obtained the possession of the throne by the means indeed of a civil war, but with a degree of innocence singular in that age of revolutions; since he owed neither gratitude nor allegiance to his predecessor, whom he dethroned.  
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
       Valerian was about sixty years of age &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_873"></A><A HREF="#fn_873"><FONT SIZE="1">63</FONT></A> when he was invested with the purple, not by the caprice of the populace, or the clamors of the army, but by the unanimous voice of the Roman world.  In his gradual ascent through the honors of the state, he had deserved the favor of virtuous princes, and had declared himself the enemy of tyrants. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_874"></A><A HREF="#fn_874"><FONT SIZE="1">64</FONT></A> His noble birth, his mild but unblemished manners, his learning, prudence, and experience, were revered by the senate and people; and if mankind (according to the observation of an ancient writer) had been left at liberty to choose a master, their choice would most assuredly have fallen on Valerian. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_875"></A><A HREF="#fn_875"><FONT SIZE="1">65</FONT></A> Perhaps the merit of this emperor was inadequate to his reputation; perhaps his abilities, or at least his spirit, were affected by the languor and coldness of old age.  The consciousness of his decline engaged him to share the throne with a younger and more active associate; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_876"></A><A HREF="#fn_876"><FONT SIZE="1">66</FONT></A> the emergency of the times demanded a general no less than a prince; and the experience of the Roman censor might have directed him where to bestow the Imperial purple, as the reward of military merit.  But instead of making a judicious choice, which would have confirmed his reign and endeared his memory, Valerian, consulting only the dictates of affection or vanity, immediately invested with the supreme honors his son Gallienus, a youth whose effeminate vices had been hitherto concealed by the obscurity of a private station.  The joint government of the father and the son subsisted about seven, and the sole administration of Gallien continued about eight, years.  But the whole period was one uninterrupted series of confusion and calamity.  As the Roman empire was at the same time, and on every side, attacked by the blind fury of foreign invaders, and the wild ambition of domestic usurpers, we shall consult order and perspicuity, by pursuing, not so much the doubtful arrangement of dates, as the more natural distribution of subjects.  The most dangerous enemies of Rome, during the reigns of Valerian and Gallienus, were, 1. The Franks; 2. The Alemanni; 3. The Goths; and, 4. The Persians.  Under these general appellations, we may comprehend the adventures of less considerable tribes, whose obscure and uncouth names would only serve to oppress the memory and perplex the attention of the reader. 
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>     I.  As the posterity of the Franks compose one of the greatest and most enlightened nations of Europe, the powers of learning and ingenuity have been exhausted in the discovery of their unlettered ancestors.  To the tales of credulity have succeeded the systems of fancy.  Every passage has been sifted, every spot has been surveyed, that might possibly reveal some faint traces of their origin.  It has been supposed that Pannonia, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_877"></A><A HREF="#fn_877"><FONT SIZE="1">67</FONT></A> that Gaul, that the northern parts of Germany, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_878"></A><A HREF="#fn_878"><FONT SIZE="1">68</FONT></A> gave birth to that celebrated colony of warriors.  At length the most rational critics, rejecting the fictitious emigrations of ideal conquerors, have acquiesced in a sentiment whose simplicity persuades us of its truth. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_879"></A><A HREF="#fn_879"><FONT SIZE="1">69</FONT></A> They suppose, that about the year two hundred and forty, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_880"></A><A HREF="#fn_880"><FONT SIZE="1">70</FONT></A> a new confederacy was formed under the name of Franks, by the old inhabitants of the Lower Rhine and the Weser. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_881"></A><A HREF="#fn_881"><FONT SIZE="1">*_0076</FONT></A> The present circle of Westphalia, the Landgraviate of Hesse, and the duchies of Brunswick and Luneburg, were the ancient of the Chauci who, in their inaccessible morasses, defied the Roman arms; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_882"></A><A HREF="#fn_882"><FONT SIZE="1">71</FONT></A> of the Cherusci, proud of the fame of Arminius; of the Catti, formidable by their firm and intrepid infantry; and of several other tribes of inferior power and renown. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_883"></A><A HREF="#fn_883"><FONT SIZE="1">72</FONT></A> The love of liberty was the ruling passion of these Germans; the enjoyment of it their best treasure; the word that expressed that enjoyment, the most pleasing to their ear.  They deserved, they assumed, they maintained the honorable appellation of Franks, or Freemen; which concealed, though it did not extinguish, the peculiar names of the several states of the confederacy. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_884"></A><A HREF="#fn_884"><FONT SIZE="1">73</FONT></A> Tacit consent, and mutual advantage, dictated the first laws of the union; it was gradually cemented by habit and experience.  The league of the Franks may admit of some comparison with the Helvetic body; in which every canton, retaining its independent sovereignty, consults with its brethren in the common cause, without acknowledging the authority of any supreme head, or representative assembly. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_885"></A><A HREF="#fn_885"><FONT SIZE="1">74</FONT></A> But the principle of the two confederacies was extremely different.  A peace of two hundred years has rewarded the wise and honest policy of the Swiss.  An inconstant spirit, the thirst of rapine, and a disregard to the most solemn treaties, disgraced the character of the Franks.
