<p>     "The marbles of the Anician palace," were used as a proverbial expression of opulence and splendor; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_434"></A><A HREF="#fn_434"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A> but the nobles and senators of Rome aspired, in due gradation, to imitate that illustrious family.  The accurate description of the city, which was composed in the Theodosian age, enumerates one thousand seven hundred and eighty houses, the residence of wealthy and honorable citizens. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_435"></A><A HREF="#fn_435"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A> Many of these stately mansions might almost excuse the exaggeration of the poet; that Rome contained a multitude of palaces, and that each palace was equal to a city: since it included within its own precincts every thing which could be subservient either to use or luxury; markets, hippodromes, temples, fountains, baths, porticos, shady groves, and artificial aviaries. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_436"></A><A HREF="#fn_436"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A> The historian Olympiodorus, who represents the state of Rome when it was besieged by the Goths, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_437"></A><A HREF="#fn_437"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A> continues to observe, that several of the richest senators received from their estates an annual income of four thousand pounds of gold, above one hundred and sixty thousand pounds sterling; without computing the stated provision of corn and wine, which, had they been sold, might have equalled in value one third of the money.  Compared to this immoderate wealth, an ordinary revenue of a thousand or fifteen hundred pounds of gold might be considered as no more than adequate to the dignity of the senatorian rank, which required many expenses of a public and ostentatious kind.  Several examples are recorded, in the age of Honorius, of vain and popular nobles, who celebrated the year of their praetorship by a festival, which lasted seven days, and cost above one hundred thousand pounds sterling. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_438"></A><A HREF="#fn_438"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A> The estates of the Roman senators, which so far exceeded the proportion of modern wealth, were not confined to the limits of Italy.  Their possessions extended far beyond the Ionian and Aegean Seas, to the most distant provinces: the city of Nicopolis, which Augustus had founded as an eternal monument of the Actian victory, was the property of the devout Paula; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_439"></A><A HREF="#fn_439"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A> and it is observed by Seneca, that the rivers, which had divided hostile nations, now flowed through the lands of private citizens. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_440"></A><A HREF="#fn_440"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A> According to their temper and circumstances, the estates of the Romans were either cultivated by the labor of their slaves, or granted, for a certain and stipulated rent, to the industrious farmer.  The economical writers of antiquity strenuously recommend the former method, wherever it may be practicable; but if the object should be removed, by its distance or magnitude, from the immediate eye of the master, they prefer the active care of an old hereditary tenant, attached to the soil, and interested in the produce, to the mercenary administration of a negligent, perhaps an unfaithful, steward. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_441"></A><A HREF="#fn_441"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A> </p>

<p>     The opulent nobles of an immense capital, who were never excited by the pursuit of military glory, and seldom engaged in the occupations of civil government, naturally resigned their leisure to the business and amusements of private life.  At Rome, commerce was always held in contempt: but the senators, from the first age of the republic, increased their patrimony, and multiplied their clients, by the lucrative practice of usury; and the obselete laws were eluded, or violated, by the mutual inclinations and interest of both parties. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_442"></A><A HREF="#fn_442"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A> A considerable mass of treasure must always have existed at Rome, either in the current coin of the empire, or in the form of gold and silver plate; and there were many sideboards in the time of Pliny which contained more solid silver, than had been transported by Scipio from vanquished Carthage. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_443"></A><A HREF="#fn_443"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A> The greater part of the nobles, who dissipated their fortunes in profuse luxury, found themselves poor in the midst of wealth, and idle in a constant round of dissipation.  Their desires were continually gratified by the labor of a thousand hands; of the numerous train of their domestic slaves, who were actuated by the fear of punishment; and of the various professions of artificers and merchants, who were more powerfully impelled by the hopes of gain.  The ancients were destitute of many of the conveniences of life, which have been invented or improved by the progress of industry; and the plenty of glass and linen has diffused more real comforts among the modern nations of Europe, than the senators of Rome could derive from all the refinements of pompous or sensual luxury. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_444"></A><A HREF="#fn_444"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A> Their luxury, and their manners, have been the subject of minute and laborious disposition: but as such inquiries would divert me too long from the design of the present work, I shall produce an authentic state of Rome and its inhabitants, which is more peculiarly applicable to the period of the Gothic invasion. Ammianus Marcellinus, who prudently chose the capital of the empire as the residence the best adapted to the historian of his own times, has mixed with the narrative of public events a lively representation of the scenes with which he was familiarly conversant. The judicious reader will not always approve of the asperity of censure, the choice of circumstances, or the style of expression; he will perhaps detect the latent prejudices, and personal resentments, which soured the temper of Ammianus himself; but he will surely observe, with philosophic curiosity, the interesting and original picture of the manners of Rome. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_445"></A><A HREF="#fn_445"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A>

<p>     "The greatness of Rome" - such is the language of the historian - "was founded on the rare, and almost incredible, alliance of virtue and of fortune. The long period of her infancy was employed in a laborious struggle against the tribes of Italy, the neighbors and enemies of the rising city.  In the strength and ardor of youth, she sustained the storms of war; carried her victorious arms beyond the seas and the mountains; and brought home triumphal laurels from every country of the globe.  At length, verging towards old age, and sometimes conquering by the terror only of her name, she sought the blessings of ease and tranquillity.  The venerable city, which had trampled on the necks of the fiercest nations, and established a system of laws, the perpetual guardians of justice and freedom, was content, like a wise and wealthy parent, to devolve on the Caesars, her favorite sons, the care of governing her ample patrimony. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_446"></A><A HREF="#fn_446"><FONT SIZE="1">35</FONT></A> A secure and profound peace, such as had been once enjoyed in the reign of Numa, succeeded to the tumults of a republic; while Rome was still adored as the queen of the earth; and the subject nations still reverenced the name of the people, and the majesty of the senate.  But this native splendor," continues Ammianus, "is degraded, and sullied, by the conduct of some nobles, who, unmindful of their own dignity, and of that of their country, assume an unbounded license of vice and folly. They contend with each other in the empty vanity of titles and surnames; and curiously select, or invent, the most lofty and sonorous appellations, Reburrus, or Fabunius, Pagonius, or Tarasius, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_447"></A><A HREF="#fn_447"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A> which may impress the ears of the vulgar with astonishment and respect.  From a vain ambition of perpetuating their memory, they affect to multiply their likeness, in statues of bronze and marble; nor are they satisfied, unless those statues are covered with plates of gold; an honorable distinction, first granted to Acilius the consul, after he had subdued, by his arms and counsels, the power of King Antiochus.  The ostentation of displaying, of magnifying, perhaps, the rent-roll of the estates which they possess in all the provinces, from the rising to the setting sun, provokes the just resentment of every man, who recollects, that their poor and invincible ancestors were not distinguished from the meanest of the soldiers, by the delicacy of their food, or the splendor of their apparel.  But the modern nobles measure their rank and consequence according to the loftiness of their chariots, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_448"></A><A HREF="#fn_448"><FONT SIZE="1">37</FONT></A> and the weighty magnificence of their dress.  Their long robes of silk and purple float in the wind; and as they are agitated, by art or accident, they occasionally discover the under garments, the rich tunics, embroidered with the figures of various animals. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_449"></A><A HREF="#fn_449"><FONT SIZE="1">38</FONT></A> Followed by a train of fifty servants, and tearing up the pavement, they move along the streets with the same impetuous speed as if they travelled with post-horses; and the example of the senators is boldly imitated by the matrons and ladies, whose covered carriages are continually driving round the immense space of the city and suburbs.  Whenever these persons of high distinction condescend to visit the public baths, they assume, on their entrance, a tone of loud and insolent command, and appropriate to their own use the conveniences which were designed for the Roman people.  If, in these places of mixed and general resort, they meet any of the infamous ministers of their pleasures, they express their affection by a tender embrace; while they proudly decline the salutations of their fellow-citizens, who are not permitted to aspire above the honor of kissing their hands, or their knees. As soon as they have indulged themselves in the refreshment of the bath, they resume their rings, and the other ensigns of their dignity, select from their private wardrobe of the finest linen, such as might suffice for a dozen persons, the garments the most agreeable to their fancy, and maintain till their departure the same haughty demeanor; which perhaps might have been excused in the great Marcellus, after the conquest of Syracuse.  Sometimes, indeed, these heroes undertake more arduous achievements; they visit their estates in Italy, and procure themselves, by the toil of servile hands, the amusements of the chase. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_450"></A><A HREF="#fn_450"><FONT SIZE="1">39</FONT></A> If at any time, but more especially on a hot day, they have courage to sail, in their painted galleys, from the Lucrine Lake &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_451"></A><A HREF="#fn_451"><FONT SIZE="1">40</FONT></A> to their elegant villas on the seacoast of Puteoli and Cayeta, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_452"></A><A HREF="#fn_452"><FONT SIZE="1">41</FONT></A> they compare their own expeditions to the marches of Caesar and Alexander. Yet should a fly presume to settle on the silken folds of their gilded umbrellas; should a sunbeam penetrate through some unguarded and imperceptible chink, they deplore their intolerable hardships, and lament, in affected language, that they were not born in the land of the Cimmerians, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_453"></A><A HREF="#fn_453"><FONT SIZE="1">42</FONT></A> the regions of eternal darkness.  In these journeys into the country, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_454"></A><A HREF="#fn_454"><FONT SIZE="1">43</FONT></A> the whole body of the household marches with their master. In the same manner as the cavalry and infantry, the heavy and the light armed troops, the advanced guard and the rear, are marshalled by the skill of their military leaders; so the domestic officers, who bear a rod, as an ensign of authority, distribute and arrange the numerous train of slaves and attendants.  The baggage and wardrobe move in the front; and are immediately followed by a multitude of cooks, and inferior ministers, employed in the service of the kitchens, and of the table.  The main body is composed of a promiscuous crowd of slaves, increased by the accidental concourse of idle or dependent plebeians.  The rear is closed by the favorite band of eunuchs, distributed from age to youth, according to the order of seniority.  Their numbers and their deformity excite the horror of the indignant spectators, who are ready to execrate the memory of Semiramis, for the cruel art which she invented, of frustrating the purposes of nature, and of blasting in the bud the hopes of future generations.  In the exercise of domestic jurisdiction, the nobles of Rome express an exquisite sensibility for any personal injury, and a contemptuous indifference for the rest of the human species.  When they have called for warm water, if a slave has been tardy in his obedience, he is instantly chastised with three hundred lashes: but should the same slave commit a wilful murder, the master will mildly observe, that he is a worthless fellow; but that, if he repeats the offence, he shall not escape punishment.  Hospitality was formerly the virtue of the Romans; and every stranger, who could plead either merit or misfortune, was relieved, or rewarded by their generosity.  At present, if a foreigner, perhaps of no contemptible rank, is introduced to one of the proud and wealthy senators, he is welcomed indeed in the first audience, with such warm professions, and such kind inquiries, that he retires, enchanted with the affability of his illustrious friend, and full of regret that he had so long delayed his journey to Rome, the active seat of manners, as well as of empire. Secure of a favorable reception, he repeats his visit the ensuing day, and is mortified by the discovery, that his person, his name, and his country, are already forgotten.  If he still has resolution to persevere, he is gradually numbered in the train of dependants, and obtains the permission to pay his assiduous and unprofitable court to a haughty patron, incapable of gratitude or friendship; who scarcely deigns to remark his presence, his departure, or his return.  Whenever the rich prepare a solemn and popular entertainment; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_455"></A><A HREF="#fn_455"><FONT SIZE="1">44</FONT></A> whenever they celebrate, with profuse and pernicious luxury, their private banquets; the choice of the guests is the subject of anxious deliberation. The modest, the sober, and the learned, are seldom preferred; and the nomenclators, who are commonly swayed by interested motives, have the address to insert, in the list of invitations, the obscure names of the most worthless of mankind.  But the frequent and familiar companions of the great, are those parasites, who practise the most useful of all arts, the art of flattery; who eagerly applaud each word, and every action, of their immortal patron; gaze with rapture on his marble columns and variegated pavements; and strenuously praise the pomp and elegance which he is taught to consider as a part of his personal merit.  At the Roman tables, the birds, the squirrels, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_456"></A><A HREF="#fn_456"><FONT SIZE="1">45</FONT></A> or the fish, which appear of an uncommon size, are contemplated with curious attention; a pair of scales is accurately applied, to ascertain their real weight; and, while the more rational guests are disgusted by the vain and tedious repetition, notaries are summoned to attest, by an authentic record, the truth of such a marvelous event.  Another method of introduction into the houses and society of the great, is derived from the profession of gaming, or, as it is more politely styled, of play.  The confederates are united by a strict and indissoluble bond of friendship, or rather of conspiracy; a superior degree of skill in the Tesserarian art (which may be interpreted the game of dice and tables) &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_457"></A><A HREF="#fn_457"><FONT SIZE="1">46</FONT></A> is a sure road to wealth and reputation. A master of that sublime science, who in a supper, or assembly, is placed below a magistrate, displays in his countenance the surprise and indignation which Cato might be supposed to feel, when he was refused the praetorship by the votes of a capricious people.  The acquisition of knowledge seldom engages the curiosity of nobles, who abhor the fatigue, and disdain the advantages, of study; and the only books which they peruse are the Satires of Juvenal, and the verbose and fabulous histories of Marius Maximus. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_458"></A><A HREF="#fn_458"><FONT SIZE="1">47</FONT></A> The libraries, which they have inherited from their fathers, are secluded, like dreary sepulchres, from the light of day. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_459"></A><A HREF="#fn_459"><FONT SIZE="1">48</FONT></A> But the costly instruments of the theatre, flutes, and enormous lyres, and hydraulic organs, are constructed for their use; and the harmony of vocal and instrumental music is incessantly repeated in the palaces of Rome.  In those palaces, sound is preferred to sense, and the care of the body to that of the mind.  It is allowed as a salutary maxim, that the light and frivolous suspicion of a contagious malady, is of sufficient weight to excuse the visits of the most intimate friends; and even the servants, who are despatched to make the decent inquiries, are not suffered to return home, till they have undergone the ceremony of a previous ablution.  Yet this selfish and unmanly delicacy occasionally yields to the more imperious passion of avarice.  The prospect of gain will urge a rich and gouty senator as far as Spoleto; every sentiment of arrogance and dignity is subdued by the hopes of an inheritance, or even of a legacy; and a wealthy childless citizen is the most powerful of the Romans.  The art of obtaining the signature of a favorable testament, and sometimes of hastening the moment of its execution, is perfectly understood; and it has happened, that in the same house, though in different apartments, a husband and a wife, with the laudable design of overreaching each other, have summoned their respective lawyers, to declare, at the same time, their mutual, but contradictory, intentions.  The distress which follows and chastises extravagant luxury, often reduces the great to the use of the most humiliating expedients.  When they desire to borrow, they employ the base and supplicating style of the slave in the comedy; but when they are called upon to pay, they assume the royal and tragic declamation of the grandsons of Hercules.  If the demand is repeated, they readily procure some trusty sycophant, instructed to maintain a charge of poison, or magic, against the insolent creditor; who is seldom released from prison, till he has signed a discharge of the whole debt.  These vices, which degrade the moral character of the Romans, are mixed with a puerile superstition, that disgraces their understanding.  They listen with confidence to the predictions of haruspices, who pretend to read, in the entrails of victims, the signs of future greatness and prosperity; and there are many who do not presume either to bathe, or to dine, or to appear in public, till they have diligently consulted, according to the rules of astrology, the situation of Mercury, and the aspect of the moon. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_460"></A><A HREF="#fn_460"><FONT SIZE="1">49</FONT></A> It is singular enough, that this vain credulity may often be discovered among the profane sceptics, who impiously doubt, or deny, the existence of a celestial power." </p>

See Olympiodor. ap. Phot. p. 197. This popular estimation allows some latitude; but it is difficult to explain a law in the Theodosian Code, (l. vi. leg. 5,) which fixes the expense of the first praetor at 25,000, of the second at 20,000, and of the third at 15,000 folles.  The name of follis (see Mem. de l'Academie des Inscriptions, tom. xxviii. p. 727) was equally applied to a purse of 125 pieces of silver, and to a small copper coin of the value of 1/2625 part of that purse.  In the former sense, the 25,000 folles would be equal to 150,000l.; in the latter, to five or six ponuds sterling The one appears extravagant, the other is ridiculous.  There must have existed some third and middle value, which is here understood; but ambiguity is an excusable fault in the language of laws.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_440"></A><A HREF="daf03017.htm#fr_440">29</A> Seneca, Epist. lxxxix.  His language is of the declamatory kind: but declamation could scarcely exaggerate the avarice and luxury of the Romans.  The philosopher himself deserved some share of the reproach, if it be true that his rigorous exaction of Quadringenties, above three hundred thousand pounds which he had lent at high interest, provoked a rebellion in Britain, (Dion Cassius, l. lxii. p. 1003.) According to the conjecture of Gale (Antoninus's Itinerary in Britain, p. 92,) the same Faustinus possessed an estate near Bury, in Suffolk and another in the kingdom of Naples.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_442"></A><A HREF="daf03017.htm#fr_442">31</A> Valesius (ad Ammian. xiv. 6) has proved, from Chrysostom and Augustin, that the senators were not allowed to lend money at usury.  Yet it appears from the Theodosian Code, (see Godefroy ad l. ii. tit. xxxiii. tom. i. p. 230 - 289,) that they were permitted to take six percent., or one half of the legal interest; and, what is more singular, this permission was granted to the young senators.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_444"></A><A HREF="daf03017.htm#fr_444">33</A> The learned Arbuthnot (Tables of Ancient Coins, &c. p. 153) has observed with humor, and I believe with truth, that Augustus had neither glass to his windows, nor a shirt to his back.  Under the lower empire, the use of linen and glass became somewhat more common. </p> 
<p>     Note: The discovery of glass in such common use at Pompeii, spoils the argument of Arbuthnot.  See Sir W. Gell. Pompeiana, 2d ser. p. 98. - M.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_445"></A><A HREF="daf03017.htm#fr_445">34</A> It is incumbent on me to explain the liberties which I have taken with the text of Ammianus.  1. I have melted down into one piece the sixth chapter of the fourteenth and the fourth of the twenty-eighth book. 2. I have given order and connection to the confused mass of materials.  3. I have softened some extravagant hyperbeles, and pared away some superfluities of the original.  4. I have developed some observations which were insinuated rather than expressed.  With these allowances, my version will be found, not literal indeed, but faithful and exact.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_446"></A><A HREF="daf03017.htm#fr_446">35</A> Claudian, who seems to have read the history of Ammianus, speaks of this great revolution in a much less courtly style: - </p> 
<p>     Postquam jura ferox in se communia Caesar      Transtulit; et lapsi mores; desuetaque priscis      Artibus, in gremium pacis servile recessi. </p> 
<p>     De Be. Gildonico, p. 49.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_447"></A><A HREF="daf03017.htm#fr_447">36</A> The minute diligence of antiquarians has not been able to verify these extraordinary names.  I am of opinion that they were invented by the historian himself, who was afraid of any personal satire or application.  It is certain, however, that the simple denominations of the Romans were gradually lengthened to the number of four, five, or even seven, pompous surnames; as, for instance, Marcus Maecius Maemmius Furius Balburius Caecilianus Placidus.  See Noris Cenotaph Piran Dissert. iv. p. 438.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_448"></A><A HREF="daf03017.htm#fr_448">37</A> The or coaches of the romans, were often of solid silver, curiously carved and engraved; and the trappings of the mules, or horses, were embossed with gold.  This magnificence continued from the reign of Nero to that of Honorius; and the Appian way was covered with the splendid equipages of the nobles, who came out to meet St. Melania, when she returned to Rome, six years before the Gothic siege, (Seneca, epist. lxxxvii.  Plin. Hist. Natur. xxxiii. 49.  Paulin. Nolan. apud Baron. Annal. Eccles. A.D. 397, No. 5.) Yet pomp is well exchange for convenience; and a plain modern coach, that is hung upon springs, is much preferable to the silver or gold carts of antiquity, which rolled on the axle-tree, and were exposed, for the most part, to the inclemency of the weather.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_449"></A><A HREF="daf03017.htm#fr_449">38</A> In a homily of Asterius, bishop of Amasia, M. de Valois has discovered (ad Ammian. xiv. 6) that this was a new fashion; that bears, wolves lions, and tigers, woods, hunting-matches, &c., were represented in embroidery: and that the more pious coxcombs substituted the figure or legend of some favorite saint.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_450"></A><A HREF="daf03017.htm#fr_450">39</A> See Pliny's Epistles, i. 6.  Three large wild boars were allured and taken in the toils without interrupting the studies of the philosophic sportsman.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_451"></A><A HREF="daf03017.htm#fr_451">40</A> The change from the inauspicious word Avernus, which stands in the text, is immaterial.  The two lakes, Avernus and Lucrinus, communicated with each other, and were fashioned by the stupendous moles of Agrippa into the Julian port, which opened, through a narrow entrance, into the Gulf of Puteoli.  Virgil, who resided on the spot, has described (Georgic ii. 161) this work at the moment of its execution: and his commentators, especially Catrou, have derived much light from Strabo, Suetonius, and Dion.  Earthquakes and volcanoes have changed the face of the country, and turned the Lucrine Lake, since the year 1538, into the Monte Nuovo.  See Camillo Pellegrino Discorsi della Campania Felice, p. 239, 244, &c.  Antonii Sanfelicii Campania, p. 13, 88 </p>

<P><A NAME="fn_454"></A><A HREF="daf03017.htm#fr_454">43</A> We may learn from Seneca (epist. cxxiii.) three curious circumstances relative to the journeys of the Romans.  1. They were preceded by a troop of Numidian light horse, who announced, by a cloud of dust, the approach of a great man.  2. Their baggage mules transported not only the precious vases, but even the fragile vessels of crystal and murra, which last is almost proved, by the learned French translator of Seneca, (tom. iii. p. 402 - 422,) to mean the porcelain of China and Japan.  3. The beautiful faces of the young slaves were covered with a medicated crust, or ointment, which secured them against the effects of the sun and frost.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_455"></A><A HREF="daf03017.htm#fr_455">44</A> Distributio solemnium sportularum.  The sportuloe, or sportelloe, were small baskets, supposed to contain a quantity of hot provisions of the value of 100 quadrantes, or twelvepence halfpenny, which were ranged in order in the hall, and ostentatiously distributed to the hungry or servile crowd who waited at the door.  This indelicate custom is very frequently mentioned in the epigrams of Martial, and the satires of Juvenal. See likewise Suetonius, in Claud. c. 21, in Neron. c. 16, in Domitian, c. 4, 7.  These baskets of provisions were afterwards converted into large pieces of gold and silver coin, or plate, which were mutually given and accepted even by persons of the highest rank, (see Symmach. epist. iv. 55, ix. 124, and Miscell. p. 256,) on solemn occasions, of consulships, marriages, &c.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_456"></A><A HREF="daf03017.htm#fr_456">45</A> The want of an English name obliges me to refer to the common genus of squirrels, the Latin glis, the French loir; a little animal, who inhabits the woods, and remains torpid in cold weather, (see Plin. Hist. Natur. viii. 82.  Buffon, Hist. Naturelle, tom. viii. 153.  Pennant's Synopsis of Quadrupeds, p. 289.) The art of rearing and fattening great numbers of glires was practised in Roman villas as a profitable article of rural economy, (Varro, de Re Rustica, iii. 15.) The excessive demand of them for luxurious tables was increased by the foolish prohibitions of the censors; and it is reported that they are still esteemed in modern Rome, and are frequently sent as presents by the Colonna princes, (see Brotier, the last editor of Pliny tom. ii. p. 453. epud Barbou, 1779.) </p>

<P><A NAME="fn_457"></A><A HREF="daf03017.htm#fr_457">46</A> This game, which might be translated by the more familiar names of trictrac, or backgammon, was a favorite amusement of the gravest Romans; and old Mucius Scaevola, the lawyer, had the reputation of a very skilful player.  It was called ludus duodecim scriptorum, from the twelve scripta, or lines, which equally divided the alvevolus or table.  On these, the two armies, the white and the black, each consisting of fifteen men, or catculi, were regularly placed, and alternately moved according to the laws of the game, and the chances of the tesseroe, or dice.  Dr. Hyde, who diligently traces the history and varieties of the nerdiludium (a name of Persic etymology) from Ireland to Japan, pours forth, on this trifling subject, a copious torrent of classic and Oriental learning.  See Syntagma Dissertat. tom. ii. p. 217 - 405.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_459"></A><A HREF="daf03017.htm#fr_459">48</A> This satire is probably exaggerated.  The Saturnalia of Macrobius, and the epistles of Jerom, afford satisfactory proofs, that Christian theology and classic literature were studiously cultivated by several Romans, of both sexes, and of the highest rank.</P>
