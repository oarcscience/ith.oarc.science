<p>     Whilst the vacant throne of Italy was abandoned to lawless Barbarians, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1025"></A><A HREF="#fn_1025"><FONT SIZE="1">112</FONT></A> the election of a new colleague was seriously agitated in the council of Leo.  The empress Verina, studious to promote the greatness of her own family, had married one of her nieces to Julius Nepos, who succeeded his uncle Marcellinus in the sovereignty of Dalmatia, a more solid possession than the title which he was persuaded to accept, of Emperor of the West. But the measures of the Byzantine court were so languid and irresolute, that many months elapsed after the death of Anthemius, and even of Olybrius, before their destined successor could show himself, with a respectable force, to his Italian subjects.  During that interval, Glycerius, an obscure soldier, was invested with the purple by his patron Gundobald; but the Burgundian prince was unable, or unwilling, to support his nomination by a civil war: the pursuits of domestic ambition recalled him beyond the Alps, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1026"></A><A HREF="#fn_1026"><FONT SIZE="1">113</FONT></A> and his client was permitted to exchange the Roman sceptre for the bishopric of Salona.  After extinguishing such a competitor, the emperor Nepos was acknowledged by the senate, by the Italians, and by the provincials of Gaul; his moral virtues, and military talents, were loudly celebrated; and those who derived any private benefit from his government, announced, in prophetic strains, the restoration of the public felicity. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1027"></A><A HREF="#fn_1027"><FONT SIZE="1">114</FONT></A> Their hopes (if such hopes had been entertained) were confounded within the term of a single year, and the treaty of peace, which ceded Auvergue to the Visigoths, is the only event of his short and inglorious reign.  The most faithful subjects of Gaul were sacrificed, by the Italian emperor, to the hope of domestic security; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1028"></A><A HREF="#fn_1028"><FONT SIZE="1">115</FONT></A> but his repose was soon invaded by a furious sedition of the Barbarian confederates, who, under the command of Orestes, their general, were in full march from Rome to Ravenna.  Nepos trembled at their approach; and, instead of placing a just confidence in the strength of Ravenna, he hastily escaped to his ships, and retired to his Dalmatian principality, on the opposite coast of the Adriatic.  By this shameful abdication, he protracted his life about five years, in a very ambiguous state, between an emperor and an exile, till he was assassinated at Salona by the ungrateful Glycerius, who was translated, perhaps as the reward of his crime, to the archbishopric of Milan. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1029"></A><A HREF="#fn_1029"><FONT SIZE="1">116</FONT></A>

 </p> 
<p>     The nations who had asserted their independence after the death of Attila, were established, by the right of possession or conquest, in the boundless countries to the north of the Danube; or in the Roman provinces between the river and the Alps.  But the bravest of their youth enlisted in the army of confederates, who formed the defence and the terror of Italy; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1030"></A><A HREF="#fn_1030"><FONT SIZE="1">117</FONT></A> and in this promiscuous multitude, the names of the Heruli, the Scyrri, the Alani, the Turcilingi, and the Rugians, appear to have predominated.  The example of these warriors was imitated by Orestes, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1031"></A><A HREF="#fn_1031"><FONT SIZE="1">118</FONT></A> the son of Tatullus, and the father of the last Roman emperor of the West. Orestes, who has been already mentioned in this History, had never deserted his country.  His birth and fortunes rendered him one of the most illustrious subjects of Pannonia. When that province was ceded to the Huns, he entered into the service of Attila, his lawful sovereign, obtained the office of his secretary, and was repeatedly sent ambassador to Constantinople, to represent the person, and signify the commands, of the imperious monarch.  The death of that conqueror restored him to his freedom; and Orestes might honorably refuse either to follow the sons of Attila into the Scythian desert, or to obey the Ostrogoths, who had usurped the dominion of Pannonia.  He preferred the service of the Italian princes, the successors of Valentinian; and as he possessed the qualifications of courage, industry, and experience, he advanced with rapid steps in the military profession, till he was elevated, by the favor of Nepos himself, to the dignities of patrician, and master-general of the troops. These troops had been long accustomed to reverence the character and authority of Orestes, who affected their manners, conversed with them in their own language, and was intimately connected with their national chieftains, by long habits of familiarity and friendship.  At his solicitation they rose in arms against the obscure Greek, who presumed to claim their obedience; and when Orestes, from some secret motive, declined the purple, they consented, with the same facility, to acknowledge his son Augustulus as the emperor of the West.  By the abdication of Nepos, Orestes had now attained the summit of his ambitious hopes; but he soon discovered, before the end of the first year, that the lessons of perjury and ingratitude, which a rebel must inculcate, will be resorted to against himself; and that the precarious sovereign of Italy was only permitted to choose, whether he would be the slave, or the victim, of his Barbarian mercenaries.  The dangerous alliance of these strangers had oppressed and insulted the last remains of Roman freedom and dignity.  At each revolution, their pay and privileges were augmented; but their insolence increased in a still more extravagant degree; they envied the fortune of their brethren in Gaul, Spain, and Africa, whose victorious arms had acquired an independent and perpetual inheritance; and they insisted on their peremptory demand, that a third part of the lands of Italy should be immediately divided among them. Orestes, with a spirit, which, in another situation, might be entitled to our esteem, chose rather to encounter the rage of an armed multitude, than to subscribe the ruin of an innocent people.  He rejected the audacious demand; and his refusal was favorable to the ambition of Odoacer; a bold Barbarian, who assured his fellow-soldiers, that, if they dared to associate under his command, they might soon extort the justice which had been denied to their dutiful petitions.  From all the camps and garrisons of Italy, the confederates, actuated by the same resentment and the same hopes, impatiently flocked to the standard of this popular leader; and the unfortunate patrician, overwhelmed by the torrent, hastily retreated to the strong city of Pavia, the episcopal seat of the holy Epiphanites.  Pavia was immediately besieged, the fortifications were stormed, the town was pillaged; and although the bishop might labor, with much zeal and some success, to save the property of the church, and the chastity of female captives, the tumult could only be appeased by the execution of Orestes. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1032"></A><A HREF="#fn_1032"><FONT SIZE="1">119</FONT></A> His brother Paul was slain in an action near Ravenna; and the helpless Augustulus, who could no longer command the respect, was reduced to implore the clemency, of Odoacer.  
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>     That successful Barbarian was the son of Edecon; who, in some remarkable transactions, particularly described in a preceding chapter, had been the colleague of Orestes himself. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1033"></A><A HREF="#fn_1033"><FONT SIZE="1">*_0028</FONT></A> The honor of an ambassador should be exempt from suspicion; and Edecon had listened to a conspiracy against the life of his sovereign.  But this apparent guilt was expiated by his merit or repentance; his rank was eminent and conspicuous; he enjoyed the favor of Attila; and the troops under his command, who guarded, in their turn, the royal village, consisted of a tribe of Scyrri, his immediate and hereditary subjects.  In the revolt of the nations, they still adhered to the Huns; and more than twelve years afterwards, the name of Edecon is honorably mentioned, in their unequal contests with the Ostrogoths; which was terminated, after two bloody battles, by the defeat and dispersion of the Scyrri. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1034"></A><A HREF="#fn_1034"><FONT SIZE="1">120</FONT></A> Their gallant leader, who did not survive this national calamity, left two sons, Onulf and Odoacer, to struggle with adversity, and to maintain as they might, by rapine or service, the faithful followers of their exile.  Onulf directed his steps towards Constantinople, where he sullied, by the assassination of a generous benefactor, the fame which he had acquired in arms.  His brother Odoacer led a wandering life among the Barbarians of Noricum, with a mind and a fortune suited to the most desperate adventures; and when he had fixed his choice, he piously visited the cell of Severinus, the popular saint of the country, to solicit his approbation and blessing.  The lowness of the door would not admit the lofty stature of Odoacer: he was obliged to stoop; but in that humble attitude the saint could discern the symptoms of his future greatness; and addressing him in a prophetic tone, "Pursue" (said he) "your design; proceed to Italy; you will soon cast away this coarse garment of skins; and your wealth will be adequate to the liberality of your mind." &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1035"></A><A HREF="#fn_1035"><FONT SIZE="1">121</FONT></A> The Barbarian, whose daring spirit accepted and ratified the prediction, was admitted into the service of the Western empire, and soon obtained an honorable rank in the guards.  His manners were gradually polished, his military skill was improved, and the confederates of Italy would not have elected him for their general, unless the exploits of Odoacer had established a high opinion of his courage and capacity. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1036"></A><A HREF="#fn_1036"><FONT SIZE="1">122</FONT></A> Their military acclamations saluted him with the title of king; but he abstained, during his whole reign, from the use of the purple and diadem, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1037"></A><A HREF="#fn_1037"><FONT SIZE="1">123</FONT></A> lest he should offend those princes, whose subjects, by their accidental mixture, had formed the victorious army, which time and policy might insensibly unite into a great nation. </p> 
<p>
  
 </p> 
<p>
  
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>     Royalty was familiar to the Barbarians, and the submissive people of Italy was prepared to obey, without a murmur, the authority which he should condescend to exercise as the vicegerent of the emperor of the West.  But Odoacer had resolved to abolish that useless and expensive office; and such is the weight of antique prejudice, that it required some boldness and penetration to discover the extreme facility of the enterprise.  The unfortunate Augustulus was made the instrument of his own disgrace: he signified his resignation to the senate; and that assembly, in their last act of obedience to a Roman prince, still affected the spirit of freedom, and the forms of the constitution.  An epistle was addressed, by their unanimous decree, to the emperor Zeno, the son-in-law and successor of Leo; who had lately been restored, after a short rebellion, to the Byzantine throne.  They solemnly "disclaim the necessity, or even the wish, of continuing any longer the Imperial succession in Italy; since, in their opinion, the majesty of a sole monarch is sufficient to pervade and protect, at the same time, both the East and the West.  In their own name, and in the name of the people, they consent that the seat of universal empire shall be transferred from Rome to Constantinople; and they basely renounce the right of choosing their master, the only vestige that yet remained of the authority which had given laws to the world.  The republic (they repeat that name without a blush) might safely confide in the civil and military virtues of Odoacer; and they humbly request, that the emperor would invest him with the title of Patrician, and the administration of the diocese of Italy." The deputies of the senate were received at Constantinople with some marks of displeasure and indignation: and when they were admitted to the audience of Zeno, he sternly reproached them with their treatment of the two emperors, Anthemius and Nepos, whom the East had successively granted to the prayers of Italy.  "The first" (continued he) "you have murdered; the second you have expelled; but the second is still alive, and whilst he lives he is your lawful sovereign." But the prudent Zeno soon deserted the hopeless cause of his abdicated colleague.  His vanity was gratified by the title of sole emperor, and by the statues erected to his honor in the several quarters of Rome; he entertained a friendly, though ambiguous, correspondence with the patrician Odoacer; and he gratefully accepted the Imperial ensigns, the sacred ornaments of the throne and palace, which the Barbarian was not unwilling to remove from the sight of the people. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1038"></A><A HREF="#fn_1038"><FONT SIZE="1">124</FONT></A> </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>     In the space of twenty years since the death of Valentinian, nine emperors had successively disappeared; and the son of Orestes, a youth recommended only by his beauty, would be the least entitled to the notice of posterity, if his reign, which was marked by the extinction of the Roman empire in the West, did not leave a memorable era in the history of mankind. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1039"></A><A HREF="#fn_1039"><FONT SIZE="1">125</FONT></A> The patrician Orestes had married the daughter of Count Romulus, of Petovio in Noricum: the name of Augustus, notwithstanding the jealousy of power, was known at Aquileia as a familiar surname; and the appellations of the two great founders, of the city and of the monarchy, were thus strangely united in the last of their successors. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1040"></A><A HREF="#fn_1040"><FONT SIZE="1">126</FONT></A> The son of Orestes assumed and disgraced the names of Romulus Augustus; but the first was corrupted into Momyllus, by the Greeks, and the second has been changed by the Latins into the contemptible diminutive Augustulus.  The life of this inoffensive youth was spared by the generous clemency of Odoacer; who dismissed him, with his whole family, from the Imperial palace, fixed his annual allowance at six thousand pieces of gold, and assigned the castle of Lucullus, in Campania, for the place of his exile or retirement. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1041"></A><A HREF="#fn_1041"><FONT SIZE="1">127</FONT></A> As soon as the Romans breathed from the toils of the Punic war, they were attracted by the beauties and the pleasures of Campania; and the country- house of the elder Scipio at Liternum exhibited a lasting model of their rustic simplicity. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1042"></A><A HREF="#fn_1042"><FONT SIZE="1">128</FONT></A> The delicious shores of the Bay of Naples were crowded with villas; and Sylla applauded the masterly skill of his rival, who had seated himself on the lofty promontory of Misenum, that commands, on every side, the sea and land, as far as the boundaries of the horizon. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1043"></A><A HREF="#fn_1043"><FONT SIZE="1">129</FONT></A> The villa of Marius was purchased, within a few years, by Lucullus, and the price had increased from two thousand five hundred, to more than fourscore thousand, pounds sterling. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1044"></A><A HREF="#fn_1044"><FONT SIZE="1">130</FONT></A> It was adorned by the new proprietor with Grecian arts and Asiatic treasures; and the houses and gardens of Lucullus obtained a distinguished rank in the list of Imperial palaces. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1045"></A><A HREF="#fn_1045"><FONT SIZE="1">131</FONT></A> When the Vandals became formidable to the sea-coast, the Lucullan villa, on the promontory of Misenum, gradually assumed the strength and appellation of a strong castle, the obscure retreat of the last emperor of the West.  About twenty years after that great revolution, it was converted into a church and monastery, to receive the bones of St. Severinus.  They securely reposed, amidst the the broken trophies of Cimbric and Armenian victories,till the beginning of the tenth century; when the fortifications, which might afford a dangerous shelter to the Saracens, were demolished by the people of Naples. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1046"></A><A HREF="#fn_1046"><FONT SIZE="1">132</FONT></A> </p>

       Odoacer was the first Barbarian who reigned in Italy, over a people who had once asserted their just superiority above the rest of mankind. The disgrace of the Romans still excites our respectful compassion, and we fondly sympathize with the imaginary grief and indignation of their degenerate posterity.  But the calamities of Italy had gradually subdued the proud consciousness of freedom and glory.  In the age of Roman virtue the provinces were subject to the arms, and the citizens to the laws, of the republic; till those laws were subverted by civil discord, and both the city and the province became the servile property of a tyrant.  The forms of the constitution, which alleviated or disguised their abject slavery, were abolished by time and violence; the Italians alternately lamented the presence or the absence of the sovereign, whom they detested or despised; and the succession of five centuries inflicted the various evils of military license, capricious despotism, and elaborate oppression.  During the same period, the Barbarians had emerged from obscurity and contempt, and the warriors of Germany and Scythia were introduced into the provinces, as the servants, the allies, and at length the masters, of the Romans, whom they insulted or protected.  The hatred of the people was suppressed by fear; they respected the spirit and splendor of the martial chiefs who were invested with the honors of the empire; and the fate of Rome had long depended on the sword of those formidable strangers.  The stern Ricimer, who trampled on the ruins of Italy, had exercised the power, without assuming the title, of a king; and the patient Romans were insensibly prepared to acknowledge the royalty of Odoacer and his Barbaric successors.       The king of Italy was not unworthy of the high station to which his valor and fortune had exalted him: his savage manners were polished by the habits of conversation; and he respected, though a conqueror and a Barbarian, the institutions, and even the prejudices, of his subjects. After an interval of seven years, Odoacer restored the consulship of the West.  For himself, he modestly, or proudly, declined an honor which was still accepted by the emperors of the East; but the curule chair was successively filled by eleven of the most illustrious senators; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1047"></A><A HREF="#fn_1047"><FONT SIZE="1">133</FONT></A> and the list is adorned by the respectable name of Basilius, whose virtues claimed the friendship and grateful applause of Sidonius, his client. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1048"></A><A HREF="#fn_1048"><FONT SIZE="1">134</FONT></A> The laws of the emperors were strictly enforced, and the civil administration of Italy was still exercised by the Praetorian praefect and his subordinate officers.  Odoacer devolved on the Roman magistrates the odious and oppressive task of collecting the public revenue; but he reserved for himself the merit of seasonable and popular indulgence. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1049"></A><A HREF="#fn_1049"><FONT SIZE="1">135</FONT></A> Like the rest of the Barbarians, he had been instructed in the Arian heresy; but he revered the monastic and episcopal characters; and the silence of the Catholics attest the toleration which they enjoyed.  The peace of the city required the interposition of his praefect Basilius in the choice of a Roman pontiff: the decree which restrained the clergy from alienating their lands was ultimately designed for the benefit of the people, whose devotions would have been taxed to repair the dilapidations of the church. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1050"></A><A HREF="#fn_1050"><FONT SIZE="1">136</FONT></A> Italy was protected by the arms of its conqueror; and its frontiers were respected by the Barbarians of Gaul and Germany, who had so long insulted the feeble race of Theodosius.  Odoacer passed the Adriatic, to chastise the assassins of the emperor Nepos, and to acquire the maritime province of Dalmatia.  He passed the Alps, to rescue the remains of Noricum from Fava, or Feletheus, king of the Rugians, who held his residence beyond the Danube.  The king was vanquished in battle, and led away prisoner; a numerous colony of captives and subjects was transplanted into Italy; and Rome, after a long period of defeat and disgrace, might claim the triumph of her Barbarian master. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1051"></A><A HREF="#fn_1051"><FONT SIZE="1">137</FONT></A> </p>

 </p> 
<p>
  
 </p> 
<p>     Notwithstanding the prudence and success of Odoacer, his kingdom exhibited the sad prospect of misery and desolation.  Since the age of Tiberius, the decay of agriculture had been felt in Italy; and it was a just subject of complaint, that the life of the Roman people depended on the accidents of the winds and waves. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1052"></A><A HREF="#fn_1052"><FONT SIZE="1">138</FONT></A> In the division and the decline of the empire, the tributary harvests of Egypt and Africa were withdrawn; the numbers of the inhabitants continually diminished with the means of subsistence; and the country was exhausted by the irretrievable losses of war, famine, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1053"></A><A HREF="#fn_1053"><FONT SIZE="1">139</FONT></A> and pestilence.  St. Ambrose has deplored the ruin of a populous district, which had been once adorned with the flourishing cities of Bologna, Modena, Regium, and Placentia. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1054"></A><A HREF="#fn_1054"><FONT SIZE="1">140</FONT></A> Pope Gelasius was a subject of Odoacer; and he affirms, with strong exaggeration, that in Aemilia, Tuscany, and the adjacent provinces, the human species was almost extirpated. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1055"></A><A HREF="#fn_1055"><FONT SIZE="1">141</FONT></A> The plebeians of Rome, who were fed by the hand of their master, perished or disappeared, as soon as his liberality was suppressed; the decline of the arts reduced the industrious mechanic to idleness and want; and the senators, who might support with patience the ruin of their country, bewailed their private loss of wealth and luxury. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1056"></A><A HREF="#fn_1056"><FONT SIZE="1">*_0029</FONT></A> One third of those ample estates, to which the ruin of Italy is originally imputed, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1057"></A><A HREF="#fn_1057"><FONT SIZE="1">142</FONT></A> was extorted for the use of the conquerors.  Injuries were aggravated by insults; the sense of actual sufferings was imbittered by the fear of more dreadful evils; and as new lands were allotted to the new swarms of Barbarians, each senator was apprehensive lest the arbitrary surveyors should approach his favorite villa, or his most profitable farm. The least unfortunate were those who submitted without a murmur to the power which it was impossible to resist.  Since they desired to live, they owed some gratitude to the tyrant who had spared their lives; and since he was the absolute master of their fortunes, the portion which he left must be accepted as his pure and voluntary gift. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1058"></A><A HREF="#fn_1058"><FONT SIZE="1">143</FONT></A> The distress of Italy &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1059"></A><A HREF="#fn_1059"><FONT SIZE="1">!_0029</FONT></A> was mitigated by the prudence and humanity of Odoacer, who had bound himself, as the price of his elevation, to satisfy the demands of a licentious and turbulent multitude. The kings of the Barbarians were frequently resisted, deposed, or murdered, by their native subjects, and the various bands of Italian mercenaries, who associated under the standard of an elective general, claimed a larger privilege of freedom and rapine. A monarchy destitute of national union, and hereditary right, hastened to its dissolution.  After a reign of fourteen years, Odoacer was oppressed by the superior genius of Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths; a hero alike excellent in the arts of war and of government, who restored an age of peace and prosperity, and whose name still excites and deserves the attention of mankind.

<P><A NAME="fn_1036"></A><A HREF="daf03039.htm#fr_1036">122</A> Theophanes, who calls him a Goth, affirms, that he was educated, aursed in Italy, (p. 102;) and as this strong expression will not bear a literal interpretation, it must be explained by long service in the Imperial guards.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1038"></A><A HREF="daf03039.htm#fr_1038">124</A> Malchus, whose loss excites our regret, has preserved (in Excerpt. Legat. p. 93) this extraordinary embassy from the senate to Zeno. The anonymous fragment, (p. 717,) and the extract from Candidus, (apud Phot. p. 176,) are likewise of some use.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1039"></A><A HREF="daf03039.htm#fr_1039">125</A> The precise year in which the Western empire was extinguished, is not positively ascertained.  The vulgar era of A.D. 476 appears to have the sanction of authentic chronicles.  But the two dates assigned by Jornandes (c. 46, p. 680) would delay that great event to the year 479; and though M. de Buat has overlooked his evidence, he produces (tom. viii. p. 261 - 288) many collateral circumstances in support of the same opinion.</P>

We may allege a famous and similar case.  The meanest subjects of the Roman empire assumed the illustrious name of Patricius, which, by the conversion of Ireland has been communicated to a whole nation.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1042"></A><A HREF="daf03039.htm#fr_1042">128</A> See the eloquent Declamation of Seneca, (Epist. lxxxvi.) The philosopher might have recollected, that all luxury is relative; and that the elder Scipio, whose manners were polished by study and conversation, was himself accused of that vice by his ruder contemporaries, (Livy, xxix. 19.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1043"></A><A HREF="daf03039.htm#fr_1043">129</A> Sylla, in the language of a soldier, praised his peritia castrametandi, (Plin. Hist. Natur. xviii. 7.) Phaedrus, who makes its shady walks (loeta viridia) the scene of an insipid fable, (ii. 5,) has thus described the situation: - </p> 
<p>     Caesar Tiberius quum petens Neapolim,      In Misenensem villam venissit suam;      Quae monte summo posita Luculli manu      Prospectat Siculum et prospicit Tuscum mare.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1044"></A><A HREF="daf03039.htm#fr_1044">130</A> From seven myriads and a half to two hundred and fifty myriads of drachmae.  Yet even in the possession of Marius, it was a luxurious retirement.  The Romans derided his indolence; they soon bewailed his activity.  See Plutarch, in Mario, tom. ii. p. 524.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1046"></A><A HREF="daf03039.htm#fr_1046">132</A> Severinus died in Noricum, A.D. 482.  Six years afterwards, his body, which scattered miracles as it passed, was transported by his disciples into Italy.  The devotion of a Neapolitan lady invited the saint to the Lucullan villa, in the place of Augustulus, who was probably no more.  See Baronius (Annal. Eccles. A.D. 496, No. 50, 51) and Tillemont, (Mem. Eccles. tom. xvi. p. 178 - 181,) from the original life by Eugippius. The narrative of the last migration of Severinus to Naples is likewise an authentic piece.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1047"></A><A HREF="daf03039.htm#fr_1047">133</A> The consular Fasti may be found in Pagi or Muratori.  The consuls named by Odoacer, or perhaps by the Roman senate, appear to have been acknowledged in the Eastern empire.</P>

Sirmond) has compared the two leading senators of his time, (A.D. 468,) Gennadius Avienus and Caecina Basilius.  To the former he assigns the specious, to the latter the solid, virtues of public and private life.  A Basilius junior, possibly his son, was consul in the year 480.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1049"></A><A HREF="daf03039.htm#fr_1049">135</A> Epiphanius interceded for the people of Pavia; and the king first granted an indulgence of five years, and afterwards relieved them from the oppression of Pelagius, the Praetorian praefect, (Ennodius in Vit St. Epiphan., in Sirmond, Oper. tom. i. p. 1670 - 1672.)</P>

Grot.,) and in the two Chronicles of Cassiodorus and Cuspinian.  The life of St. Severinus by Eugippius, which the count de Buat (Hist. des Peuples, &c., tom. viii. c. 1, 4, 8, 9) has diligently studied, illustrates the ruin of Noricum and the Bavarian antiquities</P>

I am ignorant from whence he derives his information; but I am well assured that he relates some facts incompatible with the truth of history</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1056"></A><A HREF="daf03039.htm#fr_1056">*_0029</A> Denina supposes that the Barbarians were compelled by necessity to turn their attention to agriculture.  Italy, either imperfectly cultivated, or not at all, by the indolent or ruined proprietors, not only could not furnish the imposts, on which the pay of the soldiery depended, but not even a certain supply of the necessaries of life.  The neighboring countries were now occupied by warlike nations; the supplies of corn from Africa were cut off; foreign commerce nearly destroyed; they could not look for supplies beyond the limits of Italy, throughout which the agriculture had been long in a state of progressive but rapid depression.

Epist. 17) suggests to his friend Papirius Paetus, under the military despotism of Caesar.  The argument, however, of "vivere pulcherrimum duxi," is more forcibly addressed to a Roman philosopher, who possessed the free alternative of life or death</P>
