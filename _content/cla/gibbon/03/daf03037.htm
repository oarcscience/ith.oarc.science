<p>     Without the help of a personal interview, Genseric was sufficiently acquainted with the genius and designs of his adversary.  He practiced his customary arts of fraud and delay, but he practiced them without success. His applications for peace became each hour more submissive, and perhaps more sincere; but the inflexible Majorian had adopted the ancient maxim, that Rome could not be safe, as long as Carthage existed in a hostile state.  The king of the Vandals distrusted the valor of his native subjects, who were enervated by the luxury of the South; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_963"></A><A HREF="#fn_963"><FONT SIZE="1">51</FONT></A> he suspected the fidelity of the vanquished people, who abhorred him as an Arian tyrant; and the desperate measure, which he executed, of reducing Mauritania into a desert, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_964"></A><A HREF="#fn_964"><FONT SIZE="1">52</FONT></A> could not defeat the operations of the Roman emperor, who was at liberty to land his troops on any part of the African coast.  But Genseric was saved from impending and inevitable ruin by the treachery of some powerful subjects, envious, or apprehensive, of their master's success.  Guided by their secret intelligence, he surprised the unguarded fleet in the Bay of Carthagena: many of the ships were sunk, or taken, or burnt; and the preparations of three years were destroyed in a single day. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_965"></A><A HREF="#fn_965"><FONT SIZE="1">53</FONT></A> After this event, the behavior of the two antagonists showed them superior to their fortune.  The Vandal, instead of being elated by this accidental victory, immediately renewed his solicitations for peace.  The emperor of the West, who was capable of forming great designs, and of supporting heavy disappointments, consented to a treaty, or rather to a suspension of arms; in the full assurance that, before he could restore his navy, he should be supplied with provocations to justify a second war. Majorian returned to Italy, to prosecute his labors for the public happiness; and, as he was conscious of his own integrity, he might long remain ignorant of the dark conspiracy which threatened his throne and his life.  The recent misfortune of Carthagena sullied the glory which had dazzled the eyes of the multitude; almost every description of civil and military officers were exasperated against the Reformer, since they all derived some advantage from the abuses which he endeavored to suppress; and the patrician Ricimer impelled the inconstant passions of the Barbarians against a prince whom he esteemed and hated.  The virtues of Majorian could not protect him from the impetuous sedition, which broke out in the camp near Tortona, at the foot of the Alps. He was compelled to abdicate the Imperial purple: five days after his abdication, it was reported that he died of a dysentery; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_966"></A><A HREF="#fn_966"><FONT SIZE="1">54</FONT></A> and the humble tomb, which covered his remains, was consecrated by the respect and gratitude of succeeding generations. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_967"></A><A HREF="#fn_967"><FONT SIZE="1">55</FONT></A> The private character of Majorian inspired love and respect.  Malicious calumny and satire excited his indignation, or, if he himself were the object, his contempt; but he protected the freedom of wit, and, in the hours which the emperor gave to the familiar society of his friends, he could indulge his taste for pleasantry, without degrading the majesty of his rank. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_968"></A><A HREF="#fn_968"><FONT SIZE="1">56</FONT></A>

<p>     It was not, perhaps, without some regret, that Ricimer sacrificed his friend to the interest of his ambition: but he resolved, in a second choice, to avoid the imprudent preference of superior virtue and merit.  At his command, the obsequious senate of Rome bestowed the Imperial title on Libius Severus, who ascended the throne of the West without emerging from the obscurity of a private condition.  History has scarcely deigned to notice his birth, his elevation, his character, or his death.  Severus expired, as soon as his life became inconvenient to his patron; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_969"></A><A HREF="#fn_969"><FONT SIZE="1">57</FONT></A> and it would be useless to discriminate his nominal reign in the vacant interval of six years, between the death of Majorian and the elevation of Anthemius. During that period, the government was in the hands of Ricimer alone; and, although the modest Barbarian disclaimed the name of king, he accumulated treasures, formed a separate army, negotiated private alliances, and ruled Italy with the same independent and despotic authority, which was afterwards exercised by Odoacer and Theodoric.  But his dominions were bounded by the Alps; and two Roman generals, Marcellinus and Aegidius, maintained their allegiance to the republic, by rejecting, with disdain, the phantom which he styled an emperor. Marcellinus still adhered to the old religion; and the devout Pagans, who secretly disobeyed the laws of the church and state, applauded his profound skill in the science of divination.  But he possessed the more valuable qualifications of learning, virtue, and courage; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_970"></A><A HREF="#fn_970"><FONT SIZE="1">58</FONT></A> the study of the Latin literature had improved his taste; and his military talents had recommended him to the esteem and confidence of the great Aetius, in whose ruin he was involved.  By a timely flight, Marcellinus escaped the rage of Valentinian, and boldly asserted his liberty amidst the convulsions of the Western empire. His voluntary, or reluctant, submission to the authority of Majorian, was rewarded by the government of Sicily, and the command of an army, stationed in that island to oppose, or to attack, the Vandals; but his Barbarian mercenaries, after the emperor's death, were tempted to revolt by the artful liberality of Ricimer.  At the head of a band of faithful followers, the intrepid Marcellinus occupied the province of Dalmatia, assumed the title of patrician of the West, secured the love of his subjects by a mild and equitable reign, built a fleet which claimed the dominion of the Adriatic, and alternately alarmed the coasts of Italy and of Africa. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_971"></A><A HREF="#fn_971"><FONT SIZE="1">59</FONT></A> Aegidius, the master-general of Gaul, who equalled, or at least who imitated, the heroes of ancient Rome, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_972"></A><A HREF="#fn_972"><FONT SIZE="1">60</FONT></A> proclaimed his immortal resentment against the assassins of his beloved master.  A brave and numerous army was attached to his standard: and, though he was prevented by the arts of Ricimer, and the arms of the Visigoths, from marching to the gates of Rome, he maintained his independent sovereignty beyond the Alps, and rendered the name of Aegidius, respectable both in peace and war.  The Franks, who had punished with exile the youthful follies of Childeric, elected the Roman general for their king: his vanity, rather than his ambition, was gratified by that singular honor; and when the nation, at the end of four years, repented of the injury which they had offered to the Merovingian family, he patiently acquiesced in the restoration of the lawful prince.  The authority of Aegidius ended only with his life, and the suspicions of poison and secret violence, which derived some countenance from the character of Ricimer, were eagerly entertained by the passionate credulity of the Gauls. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_973"></A><A HREF="#fn_973"><FONT SIZE="1">61</FONT></A> </p>

 </p> 
<p>     The kingdom of Italy, a name to which the Western empire was gradually reduced, was afflicted, under the reign of Ricimer, by the incessant depredations of the Vandal pirates. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_974"></A><A HREF="#fn_974"><FONT SIZE="1">62</FONT></A> In the spring of each year, they equipped a formidable navy in the port of Carthage; and Genseric himself, though in a very advanced age, still commanded in person the most important expeditions.  His designs were concealed with impenetrable secrecy, till the moment that he hoisted sail.  When he was asked, by his pilot, what course he should steer, "Leave the determination to the winds, (replied the Barbarian, with pious arrogance;) they will transport us to the guilty coast, whose inhabitants have provoked the divine justice;" but if Genseric himself deigned to issue more precise orders, he judged the most wealthy to be the most criminal.  The Vandals repeatedly visited the coasts of Spain, Liguria, Tuscany, Campania, Lucania, Bruttium, Apulia, Calabria, Venetia, Dalmatia, Epirus, Greece, and Sicily: they were tempted to subdue the Island of Sardinia, so advantageously placed in the centre of the Mediterranean; and their arms spread desolation, or terror, from the columns of Hercules to the mouth of the Nile.  As they were more ambitious of spoil than of glory, they seldom attacked any fortified cities, or engaged any regular troops in the open field.  But the celerity of their motions enabled them, almost at the same time, to threaten and to attack the most distant objects, which attracted their desires; and as they always embarked a sufficient number of horses, they had no sooner landed, than they swept the dismayed country with a body of light cavalry.  Yet, notwithstanding the example of their king, the native Vandals and Alani insensibly declined this toilsome and perilous warfare; the hardy generation of the first conquerors was almost extinguished, and their sons, who were born in Africa, enjoyed the delicious baths and gardens which had been acquired by the valor of their fathers.  Their place was readily supplied by a various multitude of Moors and Romans, of captives and outlaws; and those desperate wretches, who had already violated the laws of their country, were the most eager to promote the atrocious acts which disgrace the victories of Genseric.  In the treatment of his unhappy prisoners, he sometimes consulted his avarice, and sometimes indulged his cruelty; and the massacre of five hundred noble citizens of Zant or Zacynthus, whose mangled bodies he cast into the Ionian Sea, was imputed, by the public indignation, to his latest posterity. </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>     Such crimes could not be excused by any provocations; but the war, which the king of the Vandals prosecuted against the Roman empire was justified by a specious and reasonable motive.  The widow of Valentinian, Eudoxia, whom he had led captive from Rome to Carthage, was the sole heiress of the Theodosian house; her elder daughter, Eudocia, became the reluctant wife of Hunneric, his eldest son; and the stern father, asserting a legal claim, which could not easily be refuted or satisfied, demanded a just proportion of the Imperial patrimony.  An adequate, or at least a valuable, compensation, was offered by the Eastern emperor, to purchase a necessary peace.  Eudoxia and her younger daughter, Placidia, were honorably restored, and the fury of the Vandals was confined to the limits of the Western empire.  The Italians, destitute of a naval force, which alone was capable of protecting their coasts, implored the aid of the more fortunate nations of the East; who had formerly acknowledged, in peace and war, the supremacy of Rome.  But the perpetual divisions of the two empires had alienated their interest and their inclinations; the faith of a recent treaty was alleged; and the Western Romans, instead of arms and ships, could only obtain the assistance of a cold and ineffectual mediation. The haughty Ricimer, who had long struggled with the difficulties of his situation, was at length reduced to address the throne of Constantinople, in the humble language of a subject; and Italy submitted, as the price and security to accept a master from the choice of the emperor of the East. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_975"></A><A HREF="#fn_975"><FONT SIZE="1">63</FONT></A> It is not the purpose of the present chapter, or even of the present volume, to continue the distinct series of the Byzantine history; but a concise view of the reign and character of the emperor Leo, may explain the last efforts that were attempted to save the falling empire of the West. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_976"></A><A HREF="#fn_976"><FONT SIZE="1">64</FONT></A>  
  
       Since the death of the younger Theodosius, the domestic repose of Constantinople had never been interrupted by war or faction.  Pulcheria had bestowed her hand, and the sceptre of the East, on the modest virtue of Marcian: he gratefully reverenced her august rank and virgin chastity; and, after her death, he gave his people the example of the religious worship that was due to the memory of the Imperial saint. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_977"></A><A HREF="#fn_977"><FONT SIZE="1">65</FONT></A> Attentive to the prosperity of his own dominions, Marcian seemed to behold, with indifference, the misfortunes of Rome; and the obstinate refusal of a brave and active prince, to draw his sword against the Vandals, was ascribed to a secret promise, which had formerly been exacted from him when he was a captive in the power of Genseric. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_978"></A><A HREF="#fn_978"><FONT SIZE="1">66</FONT></A> The death of Marcian, after a reign of seven years, would have exposed the East to the danger of a popular election; if the superior weight of a single family had not been able to incline the balance in favor of the candidate whose interest they supported.  The patrician Aspar might have placed the diadem on his own head, if he would have subscribed the Nicene creed. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_979"></A><A HREF="#fn_979"><FONT SIZE="1">67</FONT></A> During three generations, the armies of the East were successively commanded by his father, by himself, and by his son Ardaburius; his Barbarian guards formed a military force that overawed the palace and the capital; and the liberal distribution of his immense treasures rendered Aspar as popular as he was powerful.  He recommended the obscure name of Leo of Thrace, a military tribune, and the principal steward of his household.  His nomination was unanimously ratified by the senate; and the servant of Aspar received the Imperial crown from the hands of the patriarch or bishop, who was permitted to express, by this unusual ceremony, the suffrage of the Deity. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_980"></A><A HREF="#fn_980"><FONT SIZE="1">68</FONT></A> This emperor, the first of the name of Leo, has been distinguished by the title of the Great; from a succession of princes, who gradually fixed in the opinion of the Greeks a very humble standard of heroic, or at least of royal, perfection. Yet the temperate firmness with which Leo resisted the oppression of his benefactor, showed that he was conscious of his duty and of his prerogative. Aspar was astonished to find that his influence could no longer appoint a praefect of Constantinople: he presumed to reproach his sovereign with a breach of promise, and insolently shaking his purple, "It is not proper, (said he,) that the man who is invested with this garment, should be guilty of lying." "Nor is it proper, (replied Leo,) that a prince should be compelled to resign his own judgment, and the public interest, to the will of a subject."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_981"></A><A HREF="#fn_981"><FONT SIZE="1">69</FONT></A> After this extraordinary scene, it was impossible that the reconciliation of the emperor and the patrician could be sincere; or, at least, that it could be solid and permanent.  An army of Isaurians &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_982"></A><A HREF="#fn_982"><FONT SIZE="1">70</FONT></A> was secretly levied, and introduced into Constantinople; and while Leo undermined the authority, and prepared the disgrace, of the family of Aspar, his mild and cautious behavior restrained them from any rash and desperate attempts, which might have been fatal to themselves, or their enemies.  The measures of peace and war were affected by this internal revolution.  As long as Aspar degraded the majesty of the throne, the secret correspondence of religion and interest engaged him to favor the cause of Genseric.  When Leo had delivered himself from that ignominious servitude, he listened to the complaints of the Italians; resolved to extirpate the tyranny of the Vandals; and declared his alliance with his colleague, Anthemius, whom he solemnly invested with the diadem and purple of the West. </p>

       The virtues of Anthemius have perhaps been magnified, since the Imperial descent, which he could only deduce from the usurper Procopius, has been swelled into a line of emperors. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_983"></A><A HREF="#fn_983"><FONT SIZE="1">71</FONT></A> But the merit of his immediate parents, their honors, and their riches, rendered Anthemius one of the most illustrious subjects of the East.  His father, Procopius, obtained, after his Persian embassy, the rank of general and patrician; and the name of Anthemius was derived from his maternal grandfather, the celebrated praefect, who protected, with so much ability and success, the infant reign of Theodosius.  The grandson of the praefect was raised above the condition of a private subject, by his marriage with Euphemia, the daughter of the emperor Marcian.  This splendid alliance, which might supersede the necessity of merit, hastened the promotion of Anthemius to the successive dignities of count, of master-general, of consul, and of patrician; and his merit or fortune claimed the honors of a victory, which was obtained on the banks of the Danube, over the Huns.  Without indulging an extravagant ambition, the son-in-law of Marcian might hope to be his successor; but Anthemius supported the disappointment with courage and patience; and his subsequent elevation was universally approved by the public, who esteemed him worthy to reign, till he ascended the throne. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_984"></A><A HREF="#fn_984"><FONT SIZE="1">72</FONT></A> The emperor of the West marched from Constantinople, attended by several counts of high distinction, and a body of guards almost equal to the strength and numbers of a regular army: he entered Rome in triumph, and the choice of Leo was confirmed by the senate, the people, and the Barbarian confederates of Italy. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_985"></A><A HREF="#fn_985"><FONT SIZE="1">73</FONT></A> The solemn inauguration of Anthemius was followed by the nuptials of his daughter and the patrician Ricimer; a fortunate event, which was considered as the firmest security of the union and happiness of the state.  The wealth of two empires was ostentatiously displayed; and many senators completed their ruin, by an expensive effort to disguise their poverty.  All serious business was suspended during this festival; the courts of justice were shut; the streets of Rome, the theatres, the places of public and private resort, resounded with hymeneal songs and dances: and the royal bride, clothed in silken robes, with a crown on her head, was conducted to the palace of Ricimer, who had changed his military dress for the habit of a consul and a senator.  On this memorable occasion, Sidonius, whose early ambition had been so fatally blasted, appeared as the orator of Auvergne, among the provincial deputies who addressed the throne with congratulations or complaints. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_986"></A><A HREF="#fn_986"><FONT SIZE="1">74</FONT></A> The calends of January were now approaching, and the venal poet, who had loved Avitus, and esteemed Majorian, was persuaded by his friends to celebrate, in heroic verse, the merit, the felicity, the second consulship, and the future triumphs, of the emperor Anthemius.  Sidonius pronounced, with assurance and success, a panegyric which is still extant; and whatever might be the imperfections, either of the subject or of the composition, the welcome flatterer was immediately rewarded with the praefecture of Rome; a dignity which placed him among the illustrious personages of the empire, till he wisely preferred the more respectable character of a bishop and a saint. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_987"></A><A HREF="#fn_987"><FONT SIZE="1">75</FONT></A> </p>

 </p> 
<p>     The Greeks ambitiously commend the piety and catholic faith of the emperor whom they gave to the West; nor do they forget to observe, that when he left Constantinople, he converted his palace into the pious foundation of a public bath, a church, and a hospital for old men. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_988"></A><A HREF="#fn_988"><FONT SIZE="1">76</FONT></A> Yet some suspicious appearances are found to sully the theological fame of Anthemius.  From the conversation of Philotheus, a Macedonian sectary, he had imbibed the spirit of religious toleration; and the Heretics of Rome would have assembled with impunity, if the bold and vehement censure which Pope Hilary pronounced in the church of St. Peter, had not obliged him to abjure the unpopular indulgence. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_989"></A><A HREF="#fn_989"><FONT SIZE="1">77</FONT></A> Even the Pagans, a feeble and obscure remnant, conceived some vain hopes, from the indifference, or partiality, of Anthemius; and his singular friendship for the philosopher Severus, whom he promoted to the consulship, was ascribed to a secret project, of reviving the ancient worship of the gods. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_990"></A><A HREF="#fn_990"><FONT SIZE="1">78</FONT></A> These idols were crumbled into dust: and the mythology which had once been the creed of nations, was so universally disbelieved, that it might be employed without scandal, or at least without suspicion, by Christian poets. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_991"></A><A HREF="#fn_991"><FONT SIZE="1">79</FONT></A> Yet the vestiges of superstition were not absolutely obliterated, and the festival of the Lupercalia, whose origin had preceded the foundation of Rome, was still celebrated under the reign of Anthemius.  The savage and simple rites were expressive of an early state of society before the invention of arts and agriculture.  The rustic deities who presided over the toils and pleasures of the pastoral life, Pan, Faunus, and their train of satyrs, were such as the fancy of shepherds might create, sportive, petulant, and lascivious; whose power was limited, and whose malice was inoffensive.  A goat was the offering the best adapted to their character and attributes; the flesh of the victim was roasted on willow spits; and the riotous youths, who crowded to the feast, ran naked about the fields, with leather thongs in their hands, communicating, as it was supposed, the blessing of fecundity to the women whom they touched. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_992"></A><A HREF="#fn_992"><FONT SIZE="1">80</FONT></A> The altar of Pan was erected, perhaps by Evander the Arcadian, in a dark recess in the side of the Palantine hill, watered by a perpetual fountain, and shaded by a hanging grove.  A tradition, that, in the same place, Romulus and Remus were suckled by the wolf, rendered it still more sacred and venerable in the eyes of the Romans; and this sylvan spot was gradually surrounded by the stately edifices of the Forum. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_993"></A><A HREF="#fn_993"><FONT SIZE="1">81</FONT></A> After the conversion of the Imperial city, the Christians still continued, in the month of February, the annual celebration of the Lupercalia; to which they ascribed a secret and mysterious influence on the genial powers of the animal and vegetable world.  The bishops of Rome were solicitous to abolish a profane custom, so repugnant to the spirit of Christianity; but their zeal was not supported by the authority of the civil magistrate: the inveterate abuse subsisted till the end of the fifth century, and Pope Gelasius, who purified the capital from the last stain of idolatry, appeased by a formal apology, the murmurs of the senate and people. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_994"></A><A HREF="#fn_994"><FONT SIZE="1">82</FONT></A> </p>

Vandal. l. i. c. 17, and Ruinart, p. 467-481,) and in three panegyrics of Sidonius, whose chronological order is absurdly transposed in the editions both of Savaron and Sirmond.  (Avit. Carm. vii. 441-451.  Majorian. Carm. v. 327-350, 385- 440.  Anthem. Carm. ii. 348-386) In one passage the poet seems inspired by his subject, and expresses a strong idea by a lively image: -        - Hinc Vandalus hostis      Urget; et in nostrum numerosa classe quotannis      Militat excidium; conversoque ordine Fati      Torrida Caucaseos infert mihi Byrsa furoree</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_975"></A><A HREF="daf03037.htm#fr_975">63</A> The poet himself is compelled to acknowledge the distress of Ricimer: - </p> 
<p>     Praeterea invictus Ricimer, quem publica fata      Respiciunt, proprio solas vix Marte repellit      Piratam per rura vagum. </p> 
<p>Italy addresses her complaint to the Tyber, and Rome, at the solicitation of the river god, transports herself to Constantinople, renounces her ancient claims, and implores the friendship of Aurora, the goddess of the East.  This fabulous machinery, which the genius of Claudian had used and abused, is the constant and miserable resource of the muse of Sidonius.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_976"></A><A HREF="daf03037.htm#fr_976">64</A> The original authors of the reigns of Marcian, Leo, and Zeno, are reduced to some imperfect fragments, whose deficiencies must be supplied from the more recent compilations of Theophanes, Zonaras, and Cedrenus.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_977"></A><A HREF="daf03037.htm#fr_977">65</A> St. Pulcheria died A.D. 453, four years before her nominal husband; and her festival is celebrated on the 10th of September by the modern Greeks: she bequeathed an immense patrimony to pious, or, at least, to ecclesiastical, uses.  See Tillemont, Memoires Eccles. tom. xv p. 181 - 184.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_978"></A><A HREF="daf03037.htm#fr_978">66</A> See Procopius, de Bell. Vandal. l. i. c. 4, p. 185.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_979"></A><A HREF="daf03037.htm#fr_979">67</A> From this disability of Aspar to ascend the throne, it may be inferred that the stain of Heresy was perpetual and indelible, while that of Barbarism disappeared in the second generation.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_980"></A><A HREF="daf03037.htm#fr_980">68</A> Theophanes, p. 95.  This appears to be the first origin of a ceremony, which all the Christian princes of the world have since adopted and from which the clergy have deduced the most formidable consequences.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_981"></A><A HREF="daf03037.htm#fr_981">69</A> Cedrenus, (p. 345, 346,) who was conversant with the writers of better days, has preserved the remarkable words of Aspar.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_982"></A><A HREF="daf03037.htm#fr_982">70</A> The power of the Isaurians agitated the Eastern empire in the two succeeding reigns of Zeno and Anastasius; but it ended in the destruction of those Barbarians, who maintained their fierce independences about two hundred and thirty years.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_983"></A><A HREF="daf03037.htm#fr_983">71</A> -     Tali tu civis ab urbe                     Procopio genitore micas; cui prisca propago                     Augustis venit a proavis. </p> 
<p>The poet (Sidon. Panegyr. Anthem. 67 - 306) then proceeds to relate the private life and fortunes of the future emperor, with which he must have been imperfectly acquainted.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_984"></A><A HREF="daf03037.htm#fr_984">72</A> Sidonius discovers, with tolerable ingenuity, that this disappointment added new lustre to the virtues of Anthemius, (210, &c.,) who declined one sceptre, and reluctantly accepted another, (22, &c.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_985"></A><A HREF="daf03037.htm#fr_985">73</A> The poet again celebrates the unanimity of all orders of the state, (15 - 22;) and the Chronicle of Idatius mentions the forces which attended his march.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_986"></A><A HREF="daf03037.htm#fr_986">74</A> Interveni autem nuptiis Patricii Ricimeris, cui filia perennis Augusti in spem publicae securitatis copulabator.  The journey of Sidonius from Lyons, and the festival of Rome, are described with some spirit.  L. i. epist. 5, p. 9 - 13, epist. 9, p. 21.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_987"></A><A HREF="daf03037.htm#fr_987">75</A> Sidonius (l. i. epist. 9, p. 23, 24) very fairly states his motive, his labor, and his reward.  "Hic ipse Panegyricus, si non judicium, certa eventum, boni operis, accepit." He was made bishop of Clermont, A.D. 471.  Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. xvi. p. 750.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_988"></A><A HREF="daf03037.htm#fr_988">76</A> The palace of Anthemius stood on the banks of the Propontis. In the ninth century, Alexius, the son-in-law of the emperor Theophilus, obtained permission to purchase the ground; and ended his days in a monastery which he founded on that delightful spot.  Ducange Constantinopolis Christiana, p. 117, 152.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_989"></A><A HREF="daf03037.htm#fr_989">77</A> Papa Hilarius ... apud beatum Petrum Apostolum, palam ne id fieret, clara voce constrinxit, in tantum ut non ea facienda cum interpositione juramenti idem promitteret Imperator.  Gelasius Epistol ad Andronicum, apud Baron. A.D. 467, No. 3.  The cardinal observes, with some complacency, that it was much easier to plant heresies at Constantinople, than at Rome.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_990"></A><A HREF="daf03037.htm#fr_990">78</A> Damascius, in the life of the philosopher Isidore, apud Photium, p. 1049.  Damascius, who lived under Justinian, composed another work, consisting of 570 praeternatural stories of souls, daemons, apparitions, the dotage of Platonic Paganism.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_991"></A><A HREF="daf03037.htm#fr_991">79</A> In the poetical works of Sidonius, which he afterwards condemned, (l. ix. epist. 16, p. 285,) the fabulous deities are the principal actors. If Jerom was scourged by the angels for only reading Virgil, the bishop of Clermont, for such a vile imitation, deserved an additional whipping from the Muses.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_992"></A><A HREF="daf03037.htm#fr_992">80</A> Ovid (Fast. l. ii. 267 - 452) has given an amusing description of the follies of antiquity, which still inspired so much respect, that a grave magistrate, running naked through the streets, was not an object of astonishment or laughter.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_993"></A><A HREF="daf03037.htm#fr_993">81</A> See Dionys. Halicarn. l. i. p. 25, 65, edit. Hudson.  The Roman antiquaries Donatus (l. ii. c. 18, p. 173, 174) and Nardini (p. 386, 387) have labored to ascertain the true situation of the Lupercal.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_994"></A><A HREF="daf03037.htm#fr_994">82</A> Baronius published, from the MSS. of the Vatican, this epistle of Pope Gelasius, (A.D. 496, No. 28 - 45,) which is entitled Adversus Andromachum Senatorem, caeterosque Romanos, qui Lupercalia secundum morem pristinum colenda constituebant.  Gelasius always supposes that his adversaries are nominal Christians, and, that he may not yield to them in absurd prejudice, he imputes to this harmless festival all the calamities of the age.</P>
