<p>     In the cruel reigns of Decius and Dioclesian, Christianity had been proscribed, as a revolt from the ancient and hereditary religion of the empire; and the unjust suspicions which were entertained of a dark and dangerous faction, were, in some measure, countenanced by the inseparable union and rapid conquests of the Catholic church.  But the same excuses of fear and ignorance cannot be applied to the Christian emperors who violated the precepts of humanity and of the Gospel.  The experience of ages had betrayed the weakness, as well as folly, of Paganism; the light of reason and of faith had already exposed, to the greatest part of mankind, the vanity of idols; and the declining sect, which still adhered to their worship, might have been permitted to enjoy, in peace and obscurity, the religious costumes of their ancestors.  Had the Pagans been animated by the undaunted zeal which possessed the minds of the primitive believers, the triumph of the Church must have been stained with blood; and the martyrs of Jupiter and Apollo might have embraced the glorious opportunity of devoting their lives and fortunes at the foot of their altars.  But such obstinate zeal was not congenial to the loose and careless temper of Polytheism.  The violent and repeated strokes of the orthodox princes were broken by the soft and yielding substance against which they were directed; and the ready obedience of the Pagans protected them from the pains and penalties of the Theodosian Code. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_190"></A><A HREF="#fn_190"><FONT SIZE="1">57</FONT></A> Instead of asserting, that the authority of the gods was superior to that of the emperor, they desisted, with a plaintive murmur, from the use of those sacred rites which their sovereign had condemned.  If they were sometimes tempted by a sally of passion, or by the hopes of concealment, to indulge their favorite superstition, their humble repentance disarmed the severity of the Christian magistrate, and they seldom refused to atone for their rashness, by submitting, with some secret reluctance, to the yoke of the Gospel.  The churches were filled with the increasing multitude of these unworthy proselytes, who had conformed, from temporal motives, to the reigning religion; and whilst they devoutly imitated the postures, and recited the prayers, of the faithful, they satisfied their conscience by the silent and sincere invocation of the gods of antiquity. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_191"></A><A HREF="#fn_191"><FONT SIZE="1">58</FONT></A> If the Pagans wanted patience to suffer they wanted spirit to resist; and the scattered myriads, who deplored the ruin of the temples, yielded, without a contest, to the fortune of their adversaries. The disorderly opposition &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_192"></A><A HREF="#fn_192"><FONT SIZE="1">59</FONT></A> of the peasants of Syria, and the populace of Alexandria, to the rage of private fanaticism, was silenced by the name and authority of the emperor.  The Pagans of the West, without contributing to the elevation of Eugenius, disgraced, by their partial attachment, the cause and character of the usurper.  The clergy vehemently exclaimed, that he aggravated the crime of rebellion by the guilt of apostasy; that, by his permission, the altar of victory was again restored; and that the idolatrous symbols of Jupiter and Hercules were displayed in the field, against the invincible standard of the cross.  But the vain hopes of the Pagans were soon annihilated by the defeat of Eugenius; and they were left exposed to the resentment of the conqueror, who labored to deserve the favor of Heaven by the extirpation of idolatry. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_193"></A><A HREF="#fn_193"><FONT SIZE="1">60</FONT></A>

<p>     A nation of slaves is always prepared to applaud the clemency of their master, who, in the abuse of absolute power, does not proceed to the last extremes of injustice and oppression.  Theodosius might undoubtedly have proposed to his Pagan subjects the alternative of baptism or of death; and the eloquent Libanius has praised the moderation of a prince, who never enacted, by any positive law, that all his subjects should immediately embrace and practise the religion of their sovereign. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_194"></A><A HREF="#fn_194"><FONT SIZE="1">61</FONT></A> The profession of Christianity was not made an essential qualification for the enjoyment of the civil rights of society, nor were any peculiar hardships imposed on the sectaries, who credulously received the fables of Ovid, and obstinately rejected the miracles of the Gospel.  The palace, the schools, the army, and the senate, were filled with declared and devout Pagans; they obtained, without distinction, the civil and military honors of the empire. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_195"></A><A HREF="#fn_195"><FONT SIZE="1">*_0008</FONT></A> Theodosius distinguished his liberal regard for virtue and genius by the consular dignity, which he bestowed on Symmachus; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_196"></A><A HREF="#fn_196"><FONT SIZE="1">62</FONT></A> and by the personal friendship which he expressed to Libanius; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_197"></A><A HREF="#fn_197"><FONT SIZE="1">63</FONT></A> and the two eloquent apologists of Paganism were never required either to change or to dissemble their religious opinions.  The Pagans were indulged in the most licentious freedom of speech and writing; the historical and philosophic remains of Eunapius, Zosimus, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_198"></A><A HREF="#fn_198"><FONT SIZE="1">64</FONT></A> and the fanatic teachers of the school of Plato, betray the most furious animosity, and contain the sharpest invectives, against the sentiments and conduct of their victorious adversaries.  If these audacious libels were publicly known, we must applaud the good sense of the Christian princes, who viewed, with a smile of contempt, the last struggles of superstition and despair. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_199"></A><A HREF="#fn_199"><FONT SIZE="1">65</FONT></A> But the Imperial laws, which prohibited the sacrifices and ceremonies of Paganism, were rigidly executed; and every hour contributed to destroy the influence of a religion, which was supported by custom, rather than by argument.  The devotion or the poet, or the philosopher, may be secretly nourished by prayer, meditation, and study; but the exercise of public worship appears to be the only solid foundation of the religious sentiments of the people, which derive their force from imitation and habit.  The interruption of that public exercise may consummate, in the period of a few years, the important work of a national revolution.  The memory of theological opinions cannot long be preserved, without the artificial helps of priests, of temples, and of books. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_200"></A><A HREF="#fn_200"><FONT SIZE="1">66</FONT></A> The ignorant vulgar, whose minds are still agitated by the blind hopes and terrors of superstition, will be soon persuaded by their superiors to direct their vows to the reigning deities of the age; and will insensibly imbibe an ardent zeal for the support and propagation of the new doctrine, which spiritual hunger at first compelled them to accept.  The generation that arose in the world after the promulgation of the Imperial laws, was attracted within the pale of the Catholic church: and so rapid, yet so gentle, was the fall of Paganism, that only twenty-eight years after the death of Theodosius, the faint and minute vestiges were no longer visible to the eye of the legislator. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_201"></A><A HREF="#fn_201"><FONT SIZE="1">67</FONT></A>

       The ruin of the Pagan religion is described by the sophists as a dreadful and amazing prodigy, which covered the earth with darkness, and restored the ancient dominion of chaos and of night.  They relate, in solemn and pathetic strains, that the temples were converted into sepulchres, and that the holy places, which had been adorned by the statues of the gods, were basely polluted by the relics of Christian martyrs.  "The monks" (a race of filthy animals, to whom Eunapius is tempted to refuse the name of men) "are the authors of the new worship, which, in the place of those deities who are conceived by the understanding, has substituted the meanest and most contemptible slaves.  The heads, salted and pickled, of those infamous malefactors, who for the multitude of their crimes have suffered a just and ignominious death; their bodies still marked by the impression of the lash, and the scars of those tortures which were inflicted by the sentence of the magistrate; such" (continues Eunapius) 'are the gods which the earth produces in our days; such are the martyrs, the supreme arbitrators of our prayers and petitions to the Deity, whose tombs are now consecrated as the objects of the veneration of the people." &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_202"></A><A HREF="#fn_202"><FONT SIZE="1">68</FONT></A> Without approving the malice, it is natural enough to share the surprise of the sophist, the spectator of a revolution, which raised those obscure victims of the laws of Rome to the rank of celestial and invisible protectors of the Roman empire.  The grateful respect of the Christians for the martyrs of the faith, was exalted, by time and victory, into religious adoration; and the most illustrious of the saints and prophets were deservedly associated to the honors of the martyrs.  One hundred and fifty years after the glorious deaths of St. Peter and St. Paul, the Vatican and the Ostian road were distinguished by the tombs, or rather by the trophies, of those spiritual heroes. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_203"></A><A HREF="#fn_203"><FONT SIZE="1">69</FONT></A> In the age which followed the conversion of Constantine, the emperors, the consuls, and the generals of armies, devoutly visited the sepulchres of a tentmaker and a fisherman; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_204"></A><A HREF="#fn_204"><FONT SIZE="1">70</FONT></A> and their venerable bones were deposited under the altars of Christ, on which the bishops of the royal city continually offered the unbloody sacrifice. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_205"></A><A HREF="#fn_205"><FONT SIZE="1">71</FONT></A> The new capital of the Eastern world, unable to produce any ancient and domestic trophies, was enriched by the spoils of dependent provinces.  The bodies of St. Andrew, St. Luke, and St. Timothy, had reposed near three hundred years in the obscure graves, from whence they were transported, in solemn pomp, to the church of the apostles, which the magnificence of Constantine had founded on the banks of the Thracian Bosphorus. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_206"></A><A HREF="#fn_206"><FONT SIZE="1">72</FONT></A> About fifty years afterwards, the same banks were honored by the presence of Samuel, the judge and prophet of the people of Israel.  His ashes, deposited in a golden vase, and covered with a silken veil, were delivered by the bishops into each other's hands.  The relics of Samuel were received by the people with the same joy and reverence which they would have shown to the living prophet; the highways, from Palestine to the gates of Constantinople, were filled with an uninterrupted procession; and the emperor Arcadius himself, at the head of the most illustrious members of the clergy and senate, advanced to meet his extraordinary guest, who had always deserved and claimed the homage of kings. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_207"></A><A HREF="#fn_207"><FONT SIZE="1">73</FONT></A> The example of Rome and Constantinople confirmed the faith and discipline of the Catholic world.  The honors of the saints and martyrs, after a feeble and ineffectual murmur of profane reason, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_208"></A><A HREF="#fn_208"><FONT SIZE="1">74</FONT></A> were universally established; and in the age of Ambrose and Jerom, something was still deemed wanting to the sanctity of a Christian church, till it had been consecrated by some portion of holy relics, which fixed and inflamed the devotion of the faithful. </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
  
 </p> 
<p>
  
  
  
 </p> 
<p>     In the long period of twelve hundred years, which elapsed between the reign of Constantine and the reformation of Luther, the worship of saints and relics corrupted the pure and perfect simplicity of the Christian model: and some symptoms of degeneracy may be observed even in the first generations which adopted and cherished this pernicious innovation. </p> 
<p>     I.  The satisfactory experience, that the relics of saints were more valuable than gold or precious stones, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_209"></A><A HREF="#fn_209"><FONT SIZE="1">75</FONT></A> stimulated the clergy to multiply the treasures of the church.  Without much regard for truth or probability, they invented names for skeletons, and actions for names.  The fame of the apostles, and of the holy men who had imitated their virtues, was darkened by religious fiction.  To the invincible band of genuine and primitive martyrs, they added myriads of imaginary heroes, who had never existed, except in the fancy of crafty or credulous legendaries; and there is reason to suspect, that Tours might not be the only diocese in which the bones of a malefactor were adored, instead of those of a saint. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_210"></A><A HREF="#fn_210"><FONT SIZE="1">76</FONT></A> A superstitious practice, which tended to increase the temptations of fraud, and credulity, insensibly extinguished the light of history, and of reason, in the Christian world.  
  
 </p> 
<p>     II.  But the progress of superstition would have been much less rapid and victorious, if the faith of the people had not been assisted by the seasonable aid of visions and miracles, to ascertain the authenticity and virtue of the most suspicious relics.  In the reign of the younger Theodosius, Lucian, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_211"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">77</FONT></A> a presbyter of Jerusalem, and the ecclesiastical minister of the village of Caphargamala, about twenty miles from the city, related a very singular dream, which, to remove his doubts, had been repeated on three successive Saturdays. A venerable figure stood before him, in the silence of the night, with a long beard, a white robe, and a gold rod; announced himself by the name of Gamaliel, and revealed to the astonished presbyter, that his own corpse, with the bodies of his son Abibas, his friend Nicodemus, and the illustrious Stephen, the first martyr of the Christian faith, were secretly buried in the adjacent field.  He added, with some impatience, that it was time to release himself and his companions from their obscure prison; that their appearance would be salutary to a distressed world; and that they had made choice of Lucian to inform the bishop of Jerusalem of their situation and their wishes. The doubts and difficulties which still retarded this important discovery were successively removed by new visions; and the ground was opened by the bishop, in the presence of an innumerable multitude.  The coffins of Gamaliel, of his son, and of his friend, were found in regular order; but when the fourth coffin, which contained the remains of Stephen, was shown to the light, the earth trembled, and an odor, such as that of paradise, was smelt, which instantly cured the various diseases of seventy-three of the assistants.  The companions of Stephen were left in their peaceful residence of Caphargamala: but the relics of the first martyr were transported, in solemn procession, to a church constructed in their honor on Mount Sion; and the minute particles of those relics, a drop of blood, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_212"></A><A HREF="#fn_212"><FONT SIZE="1">78</FONT></A> or the scrapings of a bone, were acknowledged, in almost every province of the Roman world, to possess a divine and miraculous virtue.  The grave and learned Augustin, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_213"></A><A HREF="#fn_213"><FONT SIZE="1">79</FONT></A> whose understanding scarcely admits the excuse of credulity, has attested the innumerable prodigies which were performed in Africa by the relics of St. Stephen; and this marvellous narrative is inserted in the elaborate work of the City of God, which the bishop of Hippo designed as a solid and immortal proof of the truth of Christianity. Augustin solemnly declares, that he has selected those miracles only which were publicly certified by the persons who were either the objects, or the spectators, of the power of the martyr.  Many prodigies were omitted, or forgotten; and Hippo had been less favorably treated than the other cities of the province.  And yet the bishop enumerates above seventy miracles, of which three were resurrections from the dead, in the space of two years, and within the limits of his own diocese. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_214"></A><A HREF="#fn_214"><FONT SIZE="1">80</FONT></A> If we enlarge our view to all the dioceses, and all the saints, of the Christian world, it will not be easy to calculate the fables, and the errors, which issued from this inexhaustible source.  But we may surely be allowed to observe, that a miracle, in that age of superstition and credulity, lost its name and its merit, since it could scarcely be considered as a deviation from the ordinary and established laws of nature. </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>     III.  The innumerable miracles, of which the tombs of the martyrs were the perpetual theatre, revealed to the pious believer the actual state and constitution of the invisible world; and his religious speculations appeared to be founded on the firm basis of fact and experience.  Whatever might be the condition of vulgar souls, in the long interval between the dissolution and the resurrection of their bodies, it was evident that the superior spirits of the saints and martyrs did not consume that portion of their existence in silent and inglorious sleep. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_215"></A><A HREF="#fn_215"><FONT SIZE="1">81</FONT></A> It was evident (without presuming to determine the place of their habitation, or the nature of their felicity) that they enjoyed the lively and active consciousness of their happiness, their virtue, and their powers; and that they had already secured the possession of their eternal reward.  The enlargement of their intellectual faculties surpassed the measure of the human imagination; since it was proved by experience, that they were capable of hearing and understanding the various petitions of their numerous votaries; who, in the same moment of time, but in the most distant parts of the world, invoked the name and assistance of Stephen or of Martin. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_216"></A><A HREF="#fn_216"><FONT SIZE="1">82</FONT></A> The confidence of their petitioners was founded on the persuasion, that the saints, who reigned with Christ, cast an eye of pity upon earth; that they were warmly interested in the prosperity of the Catholic Church; and that the individuals, who imitated the example of their faith and piety, were the peculiar and favorite objects of their most tender regard. Sometimes, indeed, their friendship might be influenced by considerations of a less exalted kind: they viewed with partial affection the places which had been consecrated by their birth, their residence, their death, their burial, or the possession of their relics.  The meaner passions of pride, avarice, and revenge, may be deemed unworthy of a celestial breast; yet the saints themselves condescended to testify their grateful approbation of the liberality of their votaries; and the sharpest bolts of punishment were hurled against those impious wretches, who violated their magnificent shrines, or disbelieved their supernatural power. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_217"></A><A HREF="#fn_217"><FONT SIZE="1">83</FONT></A> Atrocious, indeed, must have been the guilt, and strange would have been the scepticism, of those men, if they had obstinately resisted the proofs of a divine agency, which the elements, the whole range of the animal creation, and even the subtle and invisible operations of the human mind, were compelled to obey. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_218"></A><A HREF="#fn_218"><FONT SIZE="1">84</FONT></A> The immediate, and almost instantaneous, effects that were supposed to follow the prayer, or the offence, satisfied the Christians of the ample measure of favor and authority which the saints enjoyed in the presence of the Supreme God; and it seemed almost superfluous to inquire whether they were continually obliged to intercede before the throne of grace; or whether they might not be permitted to exercise, according to the dictates of their benevolence and justice, the delegated powers of their subordinate ministry.  The imagination, which had been raised by a painful effort to the contemplation and worship of the Universal Cause, eagerly embraced such inferior objects of adoration as were more proportioned to its gross conceptions and imperfect faculties.  The sublime and simple theology of the primitive Christians was gradually corrupted; and the Monarchy of heaven, already clouded by metaphysical subtleties, was degraded by the introduction of a popular mythology, which tended to restore the reign of polytheism. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_219"></A><A HREF="#fn_219"><FONT SIZE="1">85</FONT></A> </p> 
<p>
  
 </p> 
<p>
  
 </p> 
<p>
       IV.  As the objects of religion were gradually reduced to the standard of the imagination, the rites and ceremonies were introduced that seemed most powerfully to affect the senses of the vulgar.  If, in the beginning of the fifth century, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_220"></A><A HREF="#fn_220"><FONT SIZE="1">86</FONT></A> Tertullian, or Lactantius, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_221"></A><A HREF="#fn_221"><FONT SIZE="1">87</FONT></A> had been suddenly raised from the dead, to assist at the festival of some popular saint, or martyr, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">88</FONT></A> they would have gazed with astonishment, and indignation, on the profane spectacle, which had succeeded to the pure and spiritual worship of a Christian congregation.  As soon as the doors of the church were thrown open, they must have been offended by the smoke of incense, the perfume of flowers, and the glare of lamps and tapers, which diffused, at noonday, a gaudy, superfluous, and, in their opinion, a sacrilegious light. If they approached the balustrade of the altar, they made their way through the prostrate crowd, consisting, for the most part, of strangers and pilgrims, who resorted to the city on the vigil of the feast; and who already felt the strong intoxication of fanaticism, and, perhaps, of wine. Their devout kisses were imprinted on the walls and pavement of the sacred edifice; and their fervent prayers were directed, whatever might be the language of their church, to the bones, the blood, or the ashes of the saint, which were usually concealed, by a linen or silken veil, from the eyes of the vulgar.  The Christians frequented the tombs of the martyrs, in the hope of obtaining, from their powerful intercession, every sort of spiritual, but more especially of temporal, blessings.  They implored the preservation of their health, or the cure of their infirmities; the fruitfulness of their barren wives, or the safety and happiness of their children.  Whenever they undertook any distant or dangerous journey, they requested, that the holy martyrs would be their guides and protectors on the road; and if they returned without having experienced any misfortune, they again hastened to the tombs of the martyrs, to celebrate, with grateful thanksgivings, their obligations to the memory and relics of those heavenly patrons.  The walls were hung round with symbols of the favors which they had received; eyes, and hands, and feet, of gold and silver: and edifying pictures, which could not long escape the abuse of indiscreet or idolatrous devotion, represented the image, the attributes, and the miracles of the tutelar saint.  The same uniform original spirit of superstition might suggest, in the most distant ages and countries, the same methods of deceiving the credulity, and of affecting the senses of mankind: &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_223"></A><A HREF="#fn_223"><FONT SIZE="1">89</FONT></A> but it must ingenuously be confessed, that the ministers of the Catholic church imitated the profane model, which they were impatient to destroy.  The most respectable bishops had persuaded themselves that the ignorant rustics would more cheerfully renounce the superstitions of Paganism, if they found some resemblance, some compensation, in the bosom of Christianity.  The religion of Constantine achieved, in less than a century, the final conquest of the Roman empire: but the victors themselves were insensibly subdued by the arts of their vanquished rivals. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_224"></A><A HREF="#fn_224"><FONT SIZE="1">90</FONT></A> &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_225"></A><A HREF="#fn_225"><FONT SIZE="1">*_0009</FONT></A>

In one passage, Merobaudes, in the genuine heathen spirit, attributes the ruin of the empire to the abolition of Paganism, and almost renews the old accusation of Atheism against Christianity.  He impersonates some deity, probably Discord, who summons Bellona to take arms for the destruction of Rome; and in a strain of fierce irony recommends to her other fatal measures, to extirpate the gods of Rome: - </p>

<P><A NAME="fn_200"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_200">66</A> The Moors of Spain, who secretly preserved the Mahometan religion above a century, under the tyranny of the Inquisition, possessed the Koran, with the peculiar use of the Arabic tongue.  See the curious and honest story of their expulsion in Geddes, (Miscellanies, vol. i. p. 1 - 198.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_201"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_201">67</A> Paganos qui supersunt, quanquam jam nullos esse credamus, &c. Cod. Theodos. l. xvi. tit. x. leg. 22, A.D. 423.  The younger Theodosius was afterwards satisfied, that his judgment had been somewhat premature.       Note: The statement of Gibbon is much too strongly worded.  M. Beugnot has traced the vestiges of Paganism in the West, after this period, in monuments and inscriptions with curious industry.  Compare likewise note, p. 112, on the more tardy progress of Christianity in the rural districts. - M.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_202"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_202">68</A> See Eunapius, in the Life of the sophist Aedesius; in that of Eustathius he foretells the ruin of Paganism.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_203"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_203">69</A> Caius, (apud Euseb. Hist. Eccles. l. ii. c. 25,) a Roman presbyter, who lived in the time of Zephyrinus, (A.D. 202 - 219,) is an early witness of this superstitious practice.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_205"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_205">71</A> Male facit ergo Romanus episcopus?  qui, super mortuorum hominum, Petri & Pauli, secundum nos, ossa veneranda ... offeri Domino sacrificia, et tumulos eorum, Christi arbitratur altaria.  Jerom. tom. ii. advers. Vigilant. p. 183.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_206"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_206">72</A> Jerom (tom. ii. p. 122) bears witness to these translations, which are neglected by the ecclesiastical historians.  The passion of St. Andrew at Patrae is described in an epistle from the clergy of Achaia, which Baronius (Annal. Eccles. A.D. 60, No. 34) wishes to believe, and Tillemont is forced to reject.  St. Andrew was adopted as the spiritual founder of Constantinople, (Mem. Eccles. tom. i. p. 317 - 323, 588 - 594.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_207"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_207">73</A> Jerom (tom. ii. p. 122) pompously describes the translation of Samuel, which is noticed in all the chronicles of the times.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_208"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_208">74</A> The presbyter Vigilantius, the Protestant of his age, firmly, though ineffectually, withstood the superstition of monks, relics, saints, fasts, &c., for which Jerom compares him to the Hydra, Cerberus, the Centaurs, &c., and considers him only as the organ of the Daemon, (tom. ii. p. 120 - 126.) Whoever will peruse the controversy of St. Jerom and Vigilantius, and St. Augustin's account of the miracles of St. Stephen, may speedily gain some idea of the spirit of the Fathers.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_209"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_209">75</A> M. de Beausobre (Hist. du Manicheisme, tom. ii. p. 648) has applied a worldly sense to the pious observation of the clergy of Smyrna, who carefully preserved the relics of St. Polycarp the martyr.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_210"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_210">76</A> Martin of Tours (see his Life, c. 8, by Sulpicius Severus) extorted this confession from the mouth of the dead man.  The error is allowed to be natural; the discovery is supposed to be miraculous.  Which of the two was likely to happen most frequently?</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_211"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_211">77</A> Lucian composed in Greek his original narrative, which has been translated by Avitus, and published by Baronius, (Annal. Eccles. A.D. 415, No. 7 - 16.) The Benedictine editors of St. Augustin have given (at the end of the work de Civitate Dei) two several copies, with many various readings.  It is the character of falsehood to be loose and inconsistent. The most incredible parts of the legend are smoothed and softened by Tillemont, (Mem. Eccles. tom. ii. p. 9, &c.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_212"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_212">78</A> A phial of St. Stephen's blood was annually liquefied at Naples, till he was superseded by St. Jamarius, (Ruinart. Hist. Persecut. Vandal p. 529.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_213"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_213">79</A> Augustin composed the two-and-twenty books de Civitate Dei in the space of thirteen years, A.D. 413 - 426.  (Tillemont, (Mem. Eccles. tom. xiv. p. 608, &c.) His learning is too often borrowed, and his arguments are too often his own; but the whole work claims the merit of a magnificent design, vigorously, and not unskilfully, executed.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_214"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_214">80</A> See Augustin de Civitat. Dei, l. xxii. c. 22, and the Appendix, which contains two books of St. Stephen's miracles, by Evodius, bishop of Uzalis.  Freculphus (apud Basnage, Hist. des Juifs, tom. vii. p. 249) has preserved a Gallic or a Spanish proverb, "Whoever pretends to have read all the miracles of St. Stephen, he lies."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_215"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_215">81</A> Burnet (de Statu Mortuorum, p. 56 - 84) collects the opinions of the Fathers, as far as they assert the sleep, or repose, of human souls till the day of judgment.  He afterwards exposes (p. 91, &c.) the inconveniences which must arise, if they possessed a more active and sensible existence.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_216"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_216">82</A> Vigilantius placed the souls of the prophets and martyrs, either in the bosom of Abraham, (in loco refrigerii,) or else under the altar of God. Nec posse suis tumulis et ubi voluerunt adesse praesentes. But Jerom (tom. ii. p. 122) sternly refutes this blasphemy.  Tu Deo leges pones?  Tu apostolis vincula injicies, ut usque ad diem judicii teneantur custodia, nec sint cum Domino suo; de quibus scriptum est, Sequuntur Agnum quocunque vadit.  Si Agnus ubique, ergo, et hi, qui cum Agno sunt, ubique esse credendi sunt.  Et cum diabolus et daemones tote vagentur in orbe, &c.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_218"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_218">84</A> At Minorca, the relics of St. Stephen converted, in eight days, 540 Jews; with the help, indeed, of some wholesome severities, such as burning the synagogue, driving the obstinate infidels to starve among the rocks, &c.  See the original letter of Severus, bishop of Minorca (ad calcem St. Augustin. de Civ. Dei,) and the judicious remarks of Basnage, (tom. viii. p. 245 - 251.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_219"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_219">85</A> Mr. Hume (Essays, vol. ii. p. 434) observes, like a philosopher, the natural flux and reflux of polytheism and theism.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_220"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_220">86</A> D'Aubigne (see his own Memoires, p. 156 - 160) frankly offered, with the consent of the Huguenot ministers, to allow the first 400 years as the rule of faith.  The Cardinal du Perron haggled for forty years more, which were indiscreetly given.  Yet neither party would have found their account in this foolish bargain.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_221"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_221">87</A> The worship practised and inculcated by Tertullian, Lactantius Arnobius, &c., is so extremely pure and spiritual, that their declamations against the Pagan sometimes glance against the Jewish, ceremonies.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_222"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_222">88</A> Faustus the Manichaean accuses the Catholics of idolatry. Vertitis idola in martyres .... quos votis similibus colitis.  M. de Beausobre, (Hist. Critique du Manicheisme, tom. ii. p. 629 - 700,) a Protestant, but a philosopher, has represented, with candor and learning, the introduction of Christian idolatry in the fourth and fifth centuries.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_223"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_223">89</A> The resemblance of superstition, which could not be imitated, might be traced from Japan to Mexico.  Warburton has seized this idea, which he distorts, by rendering it too general and absolute, (Divine Legation, vol. iv. p. 126, &c.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_224"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_224">90</A> The imitation of Paganism is the subject of Dr. Middleton's agreeable letter from Rome.  Warburton's animadversions obliged him to connect (vol. iii. p. 120 - 132,) the history of the two religions, and to prove the antiquity of the Christian copy.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_225"></A><A HREF="daf03008.htm#fr_225">*_0009</A> But there was always this important difference between Christian and heathen Polytheism.  In Paganism this was the whole religion; in the darkest ages of Christianity, some, however obscure and vague, Christian notions of future retribution, of the life after death, lurked at the bottom, and operated, to a certain extent, on the thoughts and feelings, sometimes on the actions. - M.</P>
