<p>     Final Destruction Of Paganism. - Introduction Of The Worship Of Saints, And Relics, Among The Christians. </p> 
<p>     The ruin of Paganism, in the age of Theodosius, is perhaps the only example of the total extirpation of any ancient and popular superstition; and may therefore deserve to be considered as a singular event in the history of the human mind.  The Christians, more especially the clergy, had impatiently supported the prudent delays of Constantine, and the equal toleration of the elder Valentinian; nor could they deem their conquest perfect or secure, as long as their adversaries were permitted to exist. The influence which Ambrose and his brethren had acquired over the youth of Gratian, and the piety of Theodosius, was employed to infuse the maxims of persecution into the breasts of their Imperial proselytes.  Two specious principles of religious jurisprudence were established, from whence they deduced a direct and rigorous conclusion, against the subjects of the empire who still adhered to the ceremonies of their ancestors: that the magistrate is, in some measure, guilty of the crimes which he neglects to prohibit, or to punish; and, that the idolatrous worship of fabulous deities, and real daemons, is the most abominable crime against the supreme majesty of the Creator.  The laws of Moses, and the examples of Jewish history, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> were hastily, perhaps erroneously, applied, by the clergy, to the mild and universal reign of Christianity. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_130"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> The zeal of the emperors was excited to vindicate their own honor, and that of the Deity: and the temples of the Roman world were subverted, about sixty years after the conversion of Constantine. </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>     From the age of Numa to the reign of Gratian, the Romans preserved the regular succession of the several colleges of the sacerdotal order. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Fifteen Pontiffs exercised their supreme jurisdiction over all things, and persons, that were consecrated to the service of the gods; and the various questions which perpetually arose in a loose and traditionary system, were submitted to the judgment of their holy tribunal Fifteen grave and learned Augurs observed the face of the heavens, and prescribed the actions of heroes, according to the flight of birds.  Fifteen keepers of the Sibylline books (their name of Quindecemvirs was derived from their number) occasionally consulted the history of future, and, as it should seem, of contingent, events.  Six Vestals devoted their virginity to the guard of the sacred fire, and of the unknown pledges of the duration of Rome; which no mortal had been suffered to behold with impunity. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Seven Epulos prepared the table of the gods, conducted the solemn procession, and regulated the ceremonies of the annual festival.  The three Flamens of Jupiter, of Mars, and of Quirinus, were considered as the peculiar ministers of the three most powerful deities, who watched over the fate of Rome and of the universe.  The King of the Sacrifices represented the person of Numa, and of his successors, in the religious functions, which could be performed only by royal hands.  The confraternities of the Salians, the Lupercals, &c., practised such rites as might extort a smile of contempt from every reasonable man, with a lively confidence of recommending themselves to the favor of the immortal gods.  The authority, which the Roman priests had formerly obtained in the counsels of the republic, was gradually abolished by the establishment of monarchy, and the removal of the seat of empire.  But the dignity of their sacred character was still protected by the laws, and manners of their country; and they still continued, more especially the college of pontiffs, to exercise in the capital, and sometimes in the provinces, the rights of their ecclesiastical and civil jurisdiction.  Their robes of purple, chariotz of state, and sumptuous entertainments, attracted the admiration of the people; and they received, from the consecrated lands, and the public revenue, an ample stipend, which liberally supported the splendor of the priesthood, and all the expenses of the religious worship of the state.  As the service of the altar was not incompatible with the command of armies, the Romans, after their consulships and triumphs, aspired to the place of pontiff, or of augur; the seats of Cicero &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_133"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and Pompey were filled, in the fourth century, by the most illustrious members of the senate; and the dignity of their birth reflected additional splendor on their sacerdotal character.  The fifteen priests, who composed the college of pontiffs, enjoyed a more distinguished rank as the companions of their sovereign; and the Christian emperors condescended to accept the robe and ensigns, which were appropriated to the office of supreme pontiff.  But when Gratian ascended the throne, more scrupulous or more enlightened, he sternly rejected those profane symbols; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_134"></A><A HREF="#fn_134"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> applied to the service of the state, or of the church, the revenues of the priests and vestals; abolished their honors and immunities; and dissolved the ancient fabric of Roman superstition, which was supported by the opinions and habits of eleven hundred years.  Paganism was still the constitutional religion of the senate.  The hall, or temple, in which they assembled, was adorned by the statue and altar of Victory; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_135"></A><A HREF="#fn_135"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> a majestic female standing on a globe, with flowing garments, expanded wings, and a crown of laurel in her outstretched hand. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_136"></A><A HREF="#fn_136"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> The senators were sworn on the altar of the goddess to observe the laws of the emperor and of the empire: and a solemn offering of wine and incense was the ordinary prelude of their public deliberations.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>  The removal of this ancient monument was the only injury which Constantius had offered to the superstition of the Romans.  The altar of Victory was again restored by Julian, tolerated by Valentinian, and once more banished from the senate by the zeal of Gratian. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_138"></A><A HREF="#fn_138"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> But the emperor yet spared the statues of the gods which were exposed to the public veneration: four hundred and twenty-four temples, or chapels, still remained to satisfy the devotion of the people; and in every quarter of Rome the delicacy of the Christians was offended by the fumes of idolatrous sacrifice. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_139"></A><A HREF="#fn_139"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A>  
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
  
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>     But the Christians formed the least numerous party in the senate of Rome: &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_140"></A><A HREF="#fn_140"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> and it was only by their absence, that they could express their dissent from the legal, though profane, acts of a Pagan majority.  In that assembly, the dying embers of freedom were, for a moment, revived and inflamed by the breath of fanaticism.  Four respectable deputations were successively voted to the Imperial court, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_141"></A><A HREF="#fn_141"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> to represent the grievances of the priesthood and the senate, and to solicit the restoration of the altar of Victory.  The conduct of this important business was intrusted to the eloquent Symmachus, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_142"></A><A HREF="#fn_142"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> a wealthy and noble senator, who united the sacred characters of pontiff and augur with the civil dignities of proconsul of Africa and praefect of the city.  The breast of Symmachus was animated by the warmest zeal for the cause of expiring Paganism; and his religious antagonists lamented the abuse of his genius, and the inefficacy of his moral virtues. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_143"></A><A HREF="#fn_143"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> The orator, whose petition is extant to the emperor Valentinian, was conscious of the difficulty and danger of the office which he had assumed.  He cautiously avoids every topic which might appear to reflect on the religion of his sovereign; humbly declares, that prayers and entreaties are his only arms; and artfully draws his arguments from the schools of rhetoric, rather than from those of philosophy. Symmachus endeavors to seduce the imagination of a young prince, by displaying the attributes of the goddess of victory; he insinuates, that the confiscation of the revenues, which were consecrated to the service of the gods, was a measure unworthy of his liberal and disinterested character; and he maintains, that the Roman sacrifices would be deprived of their force and energy, if they were no longer celebrated at the expense, as well as in the name, of the republic.  Even scepticism is made to supply an apology for superstition.  The great and incomprehensible secret of the universe eludes the inquiry of man.  Where reason cannot instruct, custom may be permitted to guide; and every nation seems to consult the dictates of prudence, by a faithful attachment to those rites and opinions, which have received the sanction of ages.  If those ages have been crowned with glory and prosperity, if the devout people have frequently obtained the blessings which they have solicited at the altars of the gods, it must appear still more advisable to persist in the same salutary practice; and not to risk the unknown perils that may attend any rash innovations.  The test of antiquity and success was applied with singular advantage to the religion of Numa; and Rome herself, the celestial genius that presided over the fates of the city, is introduced by the orator to plead her own cause before the tribunal of the emperors.  "Most excellent princes," says the venerable matron, "fathers of your country!  pity and respect my age, which has hitherto flowed in an uninterrupted course of piety.  Since I do not repent, permit me to continue in the practice of my ancient rites.  Since I am born free, allow me to enjoy my domestic institutions.  This religion has reduced the world under my laws.  These rites have repelled Hannibal from the city, and the Gauls from the Capitol.  Were my gray hairs reserved for such intolerable disgrace?  I am ignorant of the new system that I am required to adopt; but I am well assured, that the correction of old age is always an ungrateful and ignominious office." &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_144"></A><A HREF="#fn_144"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A> The fears of the people supplied what the discretion of the orator had suppressed; and the calamities, which afflicted, or threatened, the declining empire, were unanimously imputed, by the Pagans, to the new religion of Christ and of Constantine. </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
 </p> 
<p>
  
  
 </p> 
<p>     But the hopes of Symmachus were repeatedly baffled by the firm and dexterous opposition of the archbishop of Milan, who fortified the emperors against the fallacious eloquence of the advocate of Rome.  In this controversy, Ambrose condescends to speak the language of a philosopher, and to ask, with some contempt, why it should be thought necessary to introduce an imaginary and invisible power, as the cause of those victories, which were sufficiently explained by the valor and discipline of the legions.  He justly derides the absurd reverence for antiquity, which could only tend to discourage the improvements of art, and to replunge the human race into their original barbarism.  From thence, gradually rising to a more lofty and theological tone, he pronounces, that Christianity alone is the doctrine of truth and salvation; and that every mode of Polytheism conducts its deluded votaries, through the paths of error, to the abyss of eternal perdition. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_145"></A><A HREF="#fn_145"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A> Arguments like these, when they were suggested by a favorite bishop, had power to prevent the restoration of the altar of Victory; but the same arguments fell, with much more energy and effect, from the mouth of a conqueror; and the gods of antiquity were dragged in triumph at the chariot-wheels of Theodosius. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_146"></A><A HREF="#fn_146"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A> In a full meeting of the senate, the emperor proposed, according to the forms of the republic, the important question, Whether the worship of Jupiter, or that of Christ, should be the religion of the Romans. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_147"></A><A HREF="#fn_147"><FONT SIZE="1">*_0005</FONT></A> The liberty of suffrages, which he affected to allow, was destroyed by the hopes and fears that his presence inspired; and the arbitrary exile of Symmachus was a recent admonition, that it might be dangerous to oppose the wishes of the monarch.  On a regular division of the senate, Jupiter was condemned and degraded by the sense of a very large majority; and it is rather surprising, that any members should be found bold enough to declare, by their speeches and votes, that they were still attached to the interest of an abdicated deity. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_148"></A><A HREF="#fn_148"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A> The hasty conversion of the senate must be attributed either to supernatural or to sordid motives; and many of these reluctant proselytes betrayed, on every favorable occasion, their secret disposition to throw aside the mask of odious dissimulation.  But they were gradually fixed in the new religion, as the cause of the ancient became more hopeless; they yielded to the authority of the emperor, to the fashion of the times, and to the entreaties of their wives and children, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_149"></A><A HREF="#fn_149"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A> who were instigated and governed by the clergy of Rome and the monks of the East.  The edifying example of the Anician family was soon imitated by the rest of the nobility: the Bassi, the Paullini, the Gracchi, embraced the Christian religion; and "the luminaries of the world, the venerable assembly of Catos (such are the high-flown expressions of Prudentius) were impatient to strip themselves of their pontifical garment; to cast the skin of the old serpent; to assume the snowy robes of baptismal innocence, and to humble the pride of the consular fasces before tombs of the martyrs." &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_150"></A><A HREF="#fn_150"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A> The citizens, who subsisted by their own industry, and the populace, who were supported by the public liberality, filled the churches of the Lateran, and Vatican, with an incessant throng of devout proselytes.  The decrees of the senate, which proscribed the worship of idols, were ratified by the general consent of the Romans; &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_151"></A><A HREF="#fn_151"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A> the splendor of the Capitol was defaced, and the solitary temples were abandoned to ruin and contempt. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_152"></A><A HREF="#fn_152"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A> Rome submitted to the yoke of the Gospel; and the vanquished provinces had not yet lost their reverence for the name and authority of Rome. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_153"></A><A HREF="#fn_153"><FONT SIZE="1">**_0005</FONT></A> </p>

<P><A NAME="fn_132"></A><A HREF="daf03006.htm#fr_132">4</A> These mystic, and perhaps imaginary, symbols have given birth to various fables and conjectures.  It seems probable, that the Palladium was a small statue (three cubits and a half high) of Minerva, with a lance and distaff; that it was usually enclosed in a seria, or barrel; and that a similar barrel was placed by its side to disconcert curiosity, or sacrilege.  See Mezeriac (Comment. sur les Epitres d'Ovide, tom i. p. 60 - 66) and Lipsius, (tom. iii. p. 610 de Vesta, &c. c 10.)</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_138"></A><A HREF="daf03006.htm#fr_138">10</A> These facts are mutually allowed by the two advocates, Symmachus and Ambrose.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_139"></A><A HREF="daf03006.htm#fr_139">11</A> The Notitia Urbis, more recent than Constantine, does not find one Christian church worthy to be named among the edifices of the city.  Ambrose (tom. ii. Epist. xvii. p. 825) deplores the public scandals of Rome, which continually offended the eyes, the ears, and the nostrils of the faithful.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_140"></A><A HREF="daf03006.htm#fr_140">12</A> Ambrose repeatedly affirms, in contradiction to common sense (Moyle's Works, vol. ii. p. 147,) that the Christians had a majority in the senate.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_141"></A><A HREF="daf03006.htm#fr_141">13</A> The first (A.D. 382) to Gratian, who refused them audience; the second (A.D. 384) to Valentinian, when the field was disputed by Symmachus and Ambrose; the third (A.D. 388) to Theodosius; and the fourth (A.D. 392) to Valentinian.  Lardner (Heathen Testimonies, vol. iv. p. 372 - 399) fairly represents the whole transaction.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_142"></A><A HREF="daf03006.htm#fr_142">14</A> Symmachus, who was invested with all the civil and sacerdotal honors, represented the emperor under the two characters of Pontifex Maximus, and Princeps Senatus.  See the proud inscription at the head of his works. </p> 
<p>     Note: Mr. Beugnot has made it doubtful whether Symmachus was more than Pontifex Major.  Destruction du Paganisme, vol. i. p. 459. - M.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_143"></A><A HREF="daf03006.htm#fr_143">15</A> As if any one, says Prudentius (in Symmach. i. 639) should dig in the mud with an instrument of gold and ivory.  Even saints, and polemic saints, treat this adversary with respect and civility.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_144"></A><A HREF="daf03006.htm#fr_144">16</A> See the fifty-fourth Epistle of the tenth book of Symmachus. In the form and disposition of his ten books of Epistles, he imitated the younger Pliny; whose rich and florid style he was supposed, by his friends, to equal or excel, (Macrob. Saturnal. l. v. c. i.) But the luxcriancy of Symmachus consists of barren leaves, without fruits, and even without flowers.  Few facts, and few sentiments, can be extracted from his verbose correspondence.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_145"></A><A HREF="daf03006.htm#fr_145">17</A> See Ambrose, (tom. ii. Epist. xvii. xviii. p. 825 - 833.) The former of these epistles is a short caution; the latter is a formal reply of the petition or libel of Symmachus.  The same ideas are more copiously expressed in the poetry, if it may deserve that name, of Prudentius; who composed his two books against Symmachus (A.D. 404) while that senator was still alive.  It is whimsical enough that Montesquieu (Considerations, &c. c. xix. tom. iii. p. 487) should overlook the two professed antagonists of Symmachus, and amuse himself with descanting on the more remote and indirect confutations of Orosius, St. Augustin, and Salvian.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_146"></A><A HREF="daf03006.htm#fr_146">18</A> See Prudentius (in Symmach. l. i. 545, &c.) The Christian agrees with the Pagan Zosimus (l. iv. p. 283) in placing this visit of Theodosius after the second civil war, gemini bis victor caede Tyranni, (l. i. 410.) But the time and circumstances are better suited to his first triumph.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_147"></A><A HREF="daf03006.htm#fr_147">*_0005</A> M. Beugnot (in his Histoire de la Destruction du Paganisme en Occident, i. p. 483 - 488) questions, altogether, the truth of this statement.  It is very remarkable that Zosimus and Prudentius concur in asserting the fact of the question being solemnly deliberated by the senate, though with directly opposite results.  Zosimus declares that the majority of the assembly adhered to the ancient religion of Rome; Gibbon has adopted the authority of Prudentius, who, as a Latin writer, though a poet, deserves more credit than the Greek historian.  Both concur in placing this scene after the second triumph of Theodosius; but it has been almost demonstrated (and Gibbon - see the preceding note - seems to have acknowledged this) by Pagi and Tillemont, that Theodosius did not visit Rome after the defeat of Eugenius.  M. Beugnot urges, with much force, the improbability that the Christian emperor would submit such a question to the senate, whose authority was nearly obsolete, except on one occasion, which was almost hailed as an epoch in the restoration of her ancient privileges.  The silence of Ambrose and of Jerom on an event so striking, and redounding so much to the honor of Christianity, is of considerable weight.  M. Beugnot would ascribe the whole scene to the poetic imagination of Prudentius; but I must observe, that, however Prudentius is sometimes elevated by the grandeur of his subject to vivid and eloquent language, this flight of invention would be so much bolder and more vigorous than usual with this poet, that I cannot but suppose there must have been some foundation for the story, though it may have been exaggerated by the poet, or misrepresented by the historian. - M</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_148"></A><A HREF="daf03006.htm#fr_148">19</A> Prudentius, after proving that the sense of the senate is declared by a legal majority, proceeds to say, (609, &c.) -       Adspice quam pleno subsellia nostra Senatu      Decernant infame Jovis pulvinar, et omne      Idolum longe purgata ex urbe fugandum,      Qua vocat egregii sententia Principis, illuc      Libera, cum pedibus, tum corde, frequentia transit. </p> 
<p>Zosimus ascribes to the conscript feathers a heathenish courage, which few of them are found to possess.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_149"></A><A HREF="daf03006.htm#fr_149">20</A> Jerom specifies the pontiff Albinus, who was surrounded with such a believing family of children and grandchildren, as would have been sufficient to convert even Jupiter himself; an extraordinary proselyted (tom. i. ad Laetam, p. 54.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_150"></A><A HREF="daf03006.htm#fr_150">21</A> Exultare Patres videas, pulcherrima mundi      Lumina; Conciliumque senum gestire Catonum      Candidiore toga niveum pietatis amictum      Sumere; et exuvias deponere pontificales. </p> 
<p>The fancy of Prudentius is warmed and elevated by victory</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_151"></A><A HREF="daf03006.htm#fr_151">22</A> Prudentius, after he has described the conversion of the senate and people, asks, with some truth and confidence,       Et dubitamus adhuc Romam, tibi, Christe, dicatam      In leges transisse tuas?</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_152"></A><A HREF="daf03006.htm#fr_152">23</A> Jerom exults in the desolation of the Capitol, and the other temples of Rome, (tom. i. p. 54, tom. ii. p. 95.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_153"></A><A HREF="daf03006.htm#fr_153">**_0005</A> M. Beugnot is more correct in his general estimate of the measures enforced by Theodosius for the abolition of Paganism.  He seized (according to Zosimus) the funds bestowed by the public for the expense of sacrifices.  The public sacrifices ceased, not because they were positively prohibited, but because the public treasury would no longer bear the expense.  The public and the private sacrifices in the provinces, which were not under the same regulations with those of the capital, continued to take place.  In Rome itself, many pagan ceremonies, which were without sacrifice, remained in full force.  The gods, therefore, were invoked, the temples were frequented, the pontificates inscribed, according to ancient usage, among the family titles of honor; and it cannot be asserted that idolatry was completely destroyed by Theodosius.  See Beugnot, p. 491. - M.</P>
