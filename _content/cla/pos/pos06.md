### ODE TO ANACTORIA

<span class="smallcaps">Peer</span> of Gods to me is the man thy
presence  
Crowns with joy; who hears, as he sits beside thee,  
Accents sweet of thy lips the silence breaking,  
             With lovely laughter;

Tones that make the heart in my bosom flutter,  
For if I, the space of a moment even,  
Near to thee come, any word I would utter  
             Instantly fails me;

Vain my stricken tongue would a whisper fashion,  
Subtly under my skin runs fire ecstatic;  
Straightway mists surge dim to my eyes and leave them  
             Reft of their vision;

Echoes ring in my ears; a trembling seizes  
All my body bathed in soft perspiration;  
Pale as grass I grow in my passion's madness,  
             Like one insensate;

But must I dare all, since to me unworthy,  
Bliss thy beauty brings that a God might envy;  
Never yet was fervid woman a fairer  
             Image of Kypris.

Ah! undying Daughter of God, befriend me!  
Calm my blood that thrills with impending transport;  
Feed my lips the murmur of words to stir her  
             Bosom to pity;

Overcome with kisses her faintest protest,  
Melt her mood to mine with amorous couches,—  
Till her low assent and her sigh's abandon  
             Lure me to rapture.
