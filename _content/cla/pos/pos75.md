### THE DUST OF TIMAS

<span class="smallcaps">This</span> is the dust of Timas! Here inurned  
Rest the dear ashes where so late had burned  
Her spirit's flame. She perished, gentle maid,  
Before her bridal day and now a shade,  
Silent and sad, she evermore must be  
In the dark chamber of Persephone.  
When life had faded with the flower and leaf,  
Each girl friend sweet, in token of her grief,  
Resigned her severed locks with bended head,  
Beauty's fair tribute to the lovely dead.
