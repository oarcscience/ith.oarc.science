### THE SWALLOW

<span class="smallcaps">Daughter</span> of Pandion, lovely  
Swallow that veers at my window,  
Swift on the flood of the sunshine  
        Darting thy shadow;

What is thy innocent purpose,  
Why dost thou hover and haunt me?  
Is it a kinship of sorrow  
        Brings thee anear me?

Must thou forever be tongueless,  
Flying in fear of Tereus?  
Must he for Itys pursue thee,  
        Changed to a lapwing?

Tireless of pinion and never  
Resting on bush or the branches,  
Close to the earth, up the azure,  
        Over the treetops;

After thy wing in its madness  
Follows my glance, as a flitting  
Child on the track of its mother  
        Hastens in silence.

Daughter of Pandion, lovely  
Swallow that veers at my window,  
Hast thou a message from Cyprus  
        Telling of Phaon?
