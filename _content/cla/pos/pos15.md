### THE SLEEP WIND

<span class="smallcaps">Softer</span> than mists o’er the pale green of
waters,  
O’er the charmed sea, shod with sandals of shadow  
Comes the warm sleep wind of Argolis, floating  
                Garlands of fragrance;

Comes the sweet wind by the still hours attended,  
Touching tired lids on the shores dim with distance,  
Ever its way toward the headland of Lesbos,  
                Toward Mitylene.

Faintly one fair star of evening enkindles  
On the dusk afar its lone fire Œtean,  
Shining serene till the darkness will deepen  
                Others to splendor;

Bringing ineffable peace, and the gladsome  
Return with the night of all things that morning  
Ruthlessly parted, the child to its mother,  
                Lover to lover.

From the marble court of rose-crowned companions,  
All alone my feet again seek the little  
Theatre pledged to the Muse, now deserted,  
                Facing the surges;

Where the carved Pan-heads that laugh down the gentle  
Slope of broad steps to the refluent ripple,  
Flute from their thin pipes the dithyrambs deathless,  
                Songs all unuttered.

Empty each seat where my girl friends acclaimed me,  
Poets with names on the tiered stone engraven,  
Over whose verge blooms the apple tree, drifting  
                Perfume and petals;

Gone Telesippa and tender Gyrinno,  
Anactoria, woman divine; Atthis,  
Subtlest of soul, fair Damophyla, Dica,  
                Maids of the Muses.

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

Here an hour past soul-enravished they listened  
While my rapt heart breathed its pæan impassioned,  
Chanted its wild prayer to thee, Aphrodite,  
                Daughter of Cyprus;

Now to their homes are they gone in the city,  
Pensive to dream limb-relaxed while the languid  
Slaves come and lift from the tresses they loosen,  
                Flowers that have faded.

Thou alone, Sappho, art sole with the silence,  
Sole with night and dreams that are darkness, weaving  
Thoughts that are sighs from the heart and their meaning  
                Vague as the shadow;

When the great silence shall come to thee, sad one,  
Men that forget shall remember thy music,  
Murmur thy name that shall steal on their passion  
                Soft as the sleep wind.
