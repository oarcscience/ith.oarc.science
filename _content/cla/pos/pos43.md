### ODE TO ATTHIS

<span class="smallcaps">I loved</span> you, Atthis, once, long years
ago!  
My blood was flame that thrilled to passion's throe;  
Now long neglect has quenched the olden fire,  
And blight of drifting years effaced desire.

I loved you, Atthis—joy of long ago—  
Love shook my soul as winds on forests blow;  
This lawless heart that dared exhaust delight,  
Unsated strove and maddened through the night.

I loved you, Atthis, once, long years ago!  
With pain whose surge I felt to anguish grow;  
Suffered the storms that waste the heart and leave  
A desert shore where seas but break to grieve.

I loved you, Atthis—spring of long ago—  
Watched you depart, to Andromeda go;  
Then I, as keen despair its shadow cast,  
O’er my deserted threshold, sobbing, passed.

I loved you, Atthis, once, long years ago!  
The thought of me is hateful now, I know;  
And all the lavish tenderness of old  
Has gone from me and left my bosom cold.

I loved you, Atthis—dream of long ago—  
.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .  
How the fond words, impassioned music low,  
Sustain the sigh of love's divine regret  
No length of time may bid the heart forget.
