### SPRING

<span class="smallcaps">Come</span>, shell divine, be vocal now for
me,  
As when the Hebrus river and the sea  
To Lesbos bore, on waves harmonious,  
The head and golden lyre of Orpheus.

Calliope, queen of the tuneful throng,  
Descend and be the Muse of melic song;  
For through my frame life's tides renewing bring  
The glad vein-warming vigor of the spring.

The skies that dome the earth with far blue fire  
Make the wide land one temple of desire;—  
Just now across my cheek I felt a God,  
In the enraptured breeze, pass zephyr-shod.

Was that Pan's flute, O Atthis, that we heard,  
Or the soft love-note of a woodland bird?  
That flame a scarlet wing that skimmed the stream,  
Or the red flash of our impassioned dream?

Ah, soon again we two shall gather fair  
Garlands of dill and rose to deck our bare  
White arms that cling, white breast that burns to breast,  
When the long night of love shall banish rest.
