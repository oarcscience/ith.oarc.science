### EROS

<span class="smallcaps">From</span> the gnarled branches of the apple
trees  
The heavy petals, lifted by the breeze,  
Fluttered on puffs of odor fine and fell  
In the clear water of the garden well;

And some a bolder zephyr blew in sport  
Across the marble reaches of my court,  
And some by sudden gusts were wafted wide  
Toward sea and city, down the mountain side.

Lesbos seemed Paphos, isled in rosy glow,  
Green olive hills, the violet vale below;  
The air was azure fire and o’er the blue  
Still sea the doves of Aphrodite flew.

My dreaming eyes saw Eros from afar  
Coming from heaven in his mother's car,  
In purple tunic clad; and at my heart  
The God-was aiming his relentless dart.

He whom fair Aphrodite called her son,  
She, the adored, she, the imperial One;  
He passed as winds that shake the soul, as pains  
Sweet to the heart, as fire that warms the veins;

He passed and left my limbs dissolved in dew,  
Relaxed and faint, with passion quivered through;  
Exhausted with spent thrills of dread delight,  
A sudden darkness rushing on my sight.
