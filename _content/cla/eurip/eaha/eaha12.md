### PRONUNCIATION OF GREEK NAMES

<span class="smallcaps">Greek</span> names have mostly come to the
modern world through Latin and consequently are generally given in their
Latin form. Thus in Latin the K-sound was denoted by C; KH by CH, AI- by
AE; OU- by U; U by Y, which is really a Greek letter taken over into
Latin for this express purpose. Also one or two common terminations are
given in their Latin form, Homêros becoming Homerus, Apollon Apollo, and
Alexandros Alexander. This difference in writing did not mean a
difference in pronunciation; the Latin *Aeschylus* was pronounced
(except perhaps in the termination) exactly like the Greek
"*Aiskhulos*," *Thucydides* like "*Thoukudides*."

The conventional English pronunciation follows the Latin form and
pronounces all vowels and diphthongs as in English, except that E is
always pronounced, and never used merely to lengthen a previous vowel:
e.g., "Euripides" rhymes with "insipid ease," not with "glides,"
"Hermione" roughly with "bryony," not with "tone." OE and AE are
pronounced as one syllable, like "ee" in "free" except when marked as
two syllables, as "Arsinoë: EU as in "feud." Of the consonants C is
pronounced as in English, CH as K. The only difficulty then is to know
where the stress comes and what vowels are long or short.

By Latin custom, if the last syllable but one is long, it will have the
stress (as *surprising*, *everlásting*, *Achílles*, *Agamémnon*); if the
last syllable but one is short, the stress will be on the syllable
before (as *ádamant*, *dángerous*, *Aéschylus*, *Thucýdides*).

In the following index ´ (acute accent) denotes a stressed short vowel
sound, as in *cáttle*, *imbédded*, *pítiful*, *biólogy:* ^ (circumflex)
denotes a stressed long vowel as in *câke*, *creêper*, *spîteful*,
*Octôber*, *endûrable*, *gŷroscope*.
