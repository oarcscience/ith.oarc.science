<P>I was going to say something in answer to Glaucon, when Adeimantus, his brother, interposed: Socrates, he said, you do not suppose that there is nothing more to be urged?</P>
<P>Why, what else is there? I answered.</P>
<P>The strongest point of all has not been even mentioned, he replied.</P>
<P>Well, then, according to the proverb, `Let brother help brother'-- if he fails in any part do you assist him; although I must confess that Glaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust, and take from me the power of helping justice.</P>
