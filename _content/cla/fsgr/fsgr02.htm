<h2>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</h2>

<p>In revising the <i>Four Stages of Greek Religion</i> I have found myself
obliged to change its name. I felt there was a gap in the story. The
high-water mark of Greek religious thought seems to me to have come just
between the Olympian Religion and the Failure of Nerve; and the
decline&mdash;if that is the right word&mdash;which is observable in the later
ages of antiquity is a decline not from Olympianism but from the great
spiritual and intellectual effort of the fourth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, which
culminated in the <i>Metaphysics</i> and the <i>De Anima</i> and the foundation of
the Stoa and the Garden. Consequently I have added a new chapter at this
point and raised the number of Stages to five.</p>

<p>My friend Mr. E. E. Genner has kindly enabled me to correct two or three
errors in the first edition, and I owe special thanks to my old pupil,
Professor E. R. Dodds, for several interesting observations and
criticisms on points connected with Plotinus and Sallustius. Otherwise I
have altered little. I am only sorry to have left the book so long out
of print.</p>
