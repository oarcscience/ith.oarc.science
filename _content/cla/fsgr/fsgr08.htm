<h3>THE FAILURE OF NERVE</h3>


<p>Any one who turns from the great writers of classical Athens, say
Sophocles or Aristotle, to those of the Christian era must be conscious
of a great difference in tone. There is a change in the whole relation
of the writer to the world about him. The new quality is not
specifically Christian: it is just as marked in the Gnostics and
Mithras-worshippers as in the Gospels and the Apocalypse, in Julian and
Plotinus as in Gregory and Jerome. It is hard to describe. It is a rise
of asceticism, of mysticism, in a sense, of pessimism; a loss of
self-confidence, of hope in this life and of faith in normal human
effort; a despair of patient inquiry, a cry for infallible revelation;
an indifference to the welfare of the state, a conversion of the soul to
God. It is an atmosphere in which the aim of the good man is not so much
to live justly, to help the society to which he belongs and enjoy the
esteem of his fellow creatures; but rather, by means of a burning faith,
by contempt for the world and its standards, by ecstasy, suffering, and
martyrdom, to be granted pardon for his unspeakable unworthiness, his
immeasurable sins. There is an intensifying of certain spiritual
emotions; an increase of sensitiveness, a failure of nerve.</p>

<p>Now this antithesis is often exaggerated by the admirers of one side or
the other. A hundred people write as if Sophocles had no mysticism and
practically speaking no conscience. Half a dozen retort as if <a name="page_124"><font size="1" color="green">p. 124</font></A> St. Paul
had no public spirit and no common sense. I have protested often against
this exaggeration; but, stated reasonably, as a change of proportion and
not a creation of new hearts, the antithesis is certainly based on fact.
The historical reasons for it are suggested above, in the first of these
essays.</p>

<p>My description of this complicated change is, of course, inadequate, but
not, I hope, one-sided. I do not depreciate the religions that followed
on this movement by describing the movement itself as a 'failure of
nerve'. Mankind has not yet decided which of two opposite methods leads
to the fuller and deeper knowledge of the world: the patient and
sympathetic study of the good citizen who lives in it, or the ecstatic
vision of the saint who rejects it. But probably most Christians are
inclined to believe that without some failure and sense of failure,
without a contrite heart and conviction of sin, man can hardly attain
the religious life. I can imagine an historian of this temper believing
that the period we are about to discuss was a necessary softening of
human pride, a <i>Praeparatio Evangelica</i>.<A NAME="an_fr_124_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_124_1">124_1</A></p>

<p><a name="page_125"><font size="1" color="green">p. 125</font></A> </p><p>I am concerned in this paper with the lower country lying between two
great ranges. The one range is Greek Philosophy, culminating in Plato,
Aristotle, the Porch, and the Garden; the other is Christianity,
culminating in St. Paul and his successors. The one is the work of
Hellas, using some few foreign elements; the second is the work of
Hellenistic culture on a Hebrew stock. The books of Christianity are
Greek, the philosophical background is Hellenistic, the result of the
interplay, in the free atmosphere of Greek philosophy, of religious
ideas derived from Egypt, Anatolia, Syria, and Babylon. The preaching is
carried on in Greek among the Greek-speaking workmen of the great
manufacturing and commercial cities. The first preachers are Jews: the
central scene is set in Jerusalem. I wish in this essay to indicate how
a period of religious history, which seems broken, is really continuous,
and to trace the lie of the main valleys which lead from the one range
to the other, through a large and imperfectly explored territory.</p>

<p>The territory in question is the so-called Hellenistic Age, the period
during which the Schools of Greece were 'hellenizing' the world. It is a
time of great <a name="page_126"><font size="1" color="green">p. 126</font></A> enlightenment, of vigorous propaganda, of high importance
to history. It is a time full of great names: in one school of
philosophy alone we have Zeno, Cleanthes, Chrysippus, Panaetius,
Posidonius. Yet, curiously enough, it is represented in our tradition by
something very like a mere void. There are practically no complete books
preserved, only fragments and indirect quotations. Consequently in the
search for information about this age we must throw our nets wide.
Beside books and inscriptions of the Hellenistic period proper I have
drawn on Cicero, Pliny, Seneca, and the like for evidence about their
teachers and masters. I have used many Christian and Gnostic documents
and works like the Corpus of Hermetic writings and the Mithras Liturgy.
Among modern writers I must acknowledge a special debt to the researches
of Dieterich, Cumont, Bousset, Wendland, and Reitzenstein.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The Hellenistic Age seems at first sight to have entered on an
inheritance such as our speculative Anarchists sometimes long for, a
<i>tabula rasa</i>, on which a new and highly gifted generation of thinkers
might write clean and certain the book of their discoveries about
life&mdash;what Herodotus would call their '<i>Histori&ecirc;</i>'. For, as we have seen
in the last essay, it is clear that by the time of Plato the traditional
religion of the Greek states was, if taken at its face value, a bankrupt
concern. There was hardly one aspect in which it could bear criticism;
and in the kind of test that chiefly matters, the satisfaction of men's
ethical requirements and aspirations, it was if anything weaker than
elsewhere. Now a religious <a name="page_127"><font size="1" color="green">p. 127</font></A> belief that is scientifically preposterous
may still have a long and comfortable life before it. Any worshipper can
suspend the scientific part of his mind while worshipping. But a
religious belief that is morally contemptible is in serious danger,
because when the religious emotions surge up the moral emotions are not
far away. And the clash cannot be hidden.</p>

<p>This collapse of the traditional religion of Greece might not have
mattered so much if the form of Greek social life had remained. If a
good Greek had his Polis, he had an adequate substitute in most respects
for any mythological gods. But the Polis too, as we have seen in the
last essay, fell with the rise of Macedon. It fell, perhaps, not from
any special spiritual fault of its own; it had few faults except its
fatal narrowness; but simply because there now existed another social
whole, which, whether higher or lower in civilization, was at any rate
utterly superior in brute force and in money. Devotion to the Polis lost
its reality when the Polis, with all that it represented of rights and
laws and ideals of Life, lay at the mercy of a military despot, who
might, of course, be a hero, but might equally well be a vulgar sot or a
corrupt adventurer.</p>

<p>What the succeeding ages built upon the ruins of the Polis is not our
immediate concern. In the realm of thought, on the whole, the Polis
triumphed. Aristotle based his social theory on the Polis, not the
nation. Dicaearchus, Didymus, and Posidonius followed him, and we still
use his language. Rome herself was a Polis, as well as an Empire. And
Professor Haverfield has pointed out that a City has more chance of
taking in the whole world to its freedoms and privileges <a name="page_128"><font size="1" color="green">p. 128</font></A> than a Nation
has of making men of alien birth its compatriots. A Jew of Tarsus could
easily be granted the civic rights of Rome: he could never have been
made an Italian or a Frenchman. The Stoic ideal of the World as 'one
great City of Gods and Men' has not been surpassed by any ideal based on
the Nation.</p>

<p>What we have to consider is the general trend of religious thought from,
say, the Peripatetics to the Gnostics. It is a fairly clear history. A
soil once teeming with wild weeds was to all appearance swept bare and
made ready for new sowing: skilled gardeners chose carefully the best of
herbs and plants and tended the garden sedulously. But the bounds of the
garden kept spreading all the while into strange untended ground, and
even within the original walls the weeding had been hasty and
incomplete. At the end of a few generations all was a wilderness of
weeds again, weeds rank and luxuriant and sometimes extremely beautiful,
with a half-strangled garden flower or two gleaming here and there in
the tangle of them. Does that comparison seem disrespectful to religion?
Is philosophy all flowers and traditional belief all weeds? Well, think
what a weed is. It is only a name for all the natural wild vegetation
which the earth sends up of herself, which lives and will live without
the conscious labour of man. The flowers are what we keep alive with
difficulty; the weeds are what conquer us.</p>

<p>It has been well observed by Zeller that the great weakness of all
ancient thought, not excepting Socratic thought, was that instead of
appealing to objective experiment it appealed to some subjective <a name="page_129"><font size="1" color="green">p. 129</font></A> sense
of fitness. There were exceptions, of course: Democritus, Eratosthenes,
Hippocrates, and to a great extent Aristotle. But in general there was a
strong tendency to follow Plato in supposing that people could really
solve questions by an appeal to their inner consciousness. One result of
this, no doubt, was a tendency to lay too much stress on mere agreement.
It is obvious, when one thinks about it, that quite often a large number
of people who know nothing about a subject will all agree and all be
wrong. Yet we find the most radical of ancient philosophers
unconsciously dominated by the argument <i>ex consensu gentium</i>. It is
hard to find two more uncompromising thinkers than Zeno and Epicurus.
Yet both of them, when they are almost free from the popular
superstitions, when they have constructed complete systems which, if not
absolutely logic-proof, are calculated at least to keep out the weather
for a century or so, open curious side-doors at the last moment and let
in all the gods of mythology.<A NAME="an_fr_129_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_129_1">129_1</A> True, they are admitted as
suspicious characters, and under promise of good behaviour. Epicurus
explains that they do not and cannot do anything whatever to anybody;
Zeno explains that they are not anthropomorphic, and are only symbols or
emanations or subordinates of the all-ruling Unity; both parties get rid
of the myths. But the two great reformers have admitted a dangerous
principle. The general consensus of humanity, they say, shows that there
are gods, and gods which in mind, if not also in visual <a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="green">p. 130</font></A> appearance,
resemble man. Epicurus succeeded in barring the door, and admitted
nothing more. But the Stoics presently found themselves admitting or
insisting that the same consensus proved the existence of daemons, of
witchcraft, of divination, and when they combined with the Platonic
school, of more dangerous elements still.</p>

<p>I take the Stoics and Epicureans as the two most radical schools. On the
whole both of them fought steadily and strongly against the growth of
superstition, or, if you like to put it in other language, against the
dumb demands of man's infra-rational nature. The glory of the Stoics is
to have built up a religion of extraordinary nobleness; the glory of the
Epicureans is to have upheld an ideal of sanity and humanity stark
upright amid a reeling world, and, like the old Spartans, never to have
yielded one inch of ground to the common foe.</p>

<p>The great thing to remember is that the mind of man cannot be
enlightened permanently by merely teaching him to reject some particular
set of superstitions. There is an infinite supply of other superstitions
always at hand; and the mind that desires such things&mdash;that is, the mind
that has not trained itself to the hard discipline of reasonableness and
honesty, will, as soon as its devils are cast out, proceed to fill
itself with their relations.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Let us first consider the result of the mere denial of the Olympian
religion. The essential postulate of that religion was that the world is
governed by a number of definite personal gods, possessed of a human
sense of justice and fairness and capable of being <a name="page_131"><font size="1" color="green">p. 131</font></A> influenced by normal
human motives. In general, they helped the good and punished the bad,
though doubtless they tended too much to regard as good those who paid
them proper attention and as bad those who did not.</p>

<p>Speaking broadly, what was left when this conception proved inadequate?
If it was not these personal gods who made things happen, what was it?
If the Tower of Siloam was not deliberately thrown down by the gods so
as to kill and hurt a carefully collected number of wicked people, while
letting the good escape, what was the explanation of its falling? The
answer is obvious, but it can be put in two ways. You can either say:
'It was just chance that the Tower fell at that particular moment when
So-and-so was under it.' Or you can say, with rather more reflection but
not any more common sense: 'It fell because of a definite chain of
causes, a certain degree of progressive decay in the building, a certain
definite pressure, &amp;c. It was bound to fall.'</p>

<p>There is no real difference in these statements, at least in the meaning
of those who ordinarily utter them. Both are compatible with a
reasonable and scientific view of the world. But in the Hellenistic Age,
when Greek thought was spreading rapidly and superficially over vast
semi-barbarous populations whose minds were not ripe for it, both views
turned back instinctively into a theology as personal as that of the
Olympians. It was not, of course, Zeus or Apollo who willed this; every
one knew so much: it happened by Chance. That is, Chance or Fortune
willed it. And <ins class="greek" title="Tych&ecirc;">&#932;&#8059;&#967;&#951;</ins> became a goddess like the rest. The great
catastrophes, the great transformations of the <a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="green">p. 132</font></A> mediterranean world
which marked the Hellenistic period, had a strong influence here. If
Alexander and his generals had practised some severely orthodox
Macedonian religion, it would have been easy to see that the Gods of
Macedon were the real rulers of the world. But they most markedly did
not. They accepted hospitably all the religions that crossed their path.
Some power or other was disturbing the world, that was clear. It was not
exactly the work of man, because sometimes the good were exalted,
sometimes the bad; there was no consistent purpose in the story. It was
just Fortune. Happy is the man who knows how to placate Fortune and make
her smile upon him!</p>

<p>It is worth remembering that the best seed-ground for superstition is a
society in which the fortunes of men seem to bear practically no
relation to their merits and efforts. A stable and well-governed society
does tend, speaking roughly, to ensure that the Virtuous and Industrious
Apprentice shall succeed in life, while the Wicked and Idle Apprentice
fails. And in such a society people tend to lay stress on the reasonable
or visible chains of causation. But in a country suffering from
earthquakes or pestilences, in a court governed by the whim of a despot,
in a district which is habitually the seat of a war between alien
armies, the ordinary virtues of diligence, honesty, and kindliness seem
to be of little avail. The only way to escape destruction is to win the
favour of the prevailing powers, take the side of the strongest invader,
flatter the despot, placate the Fate or Fortune or angry god that is
sending the earthquake or the pestilence. The Hellenistic period pretty
certainly <a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="green">p. 133</font></A> falls in some degree under all of these categories. And one
result is the sudden and enormous spread of the worship of Fortune. Of
course, there was always a protest. There is the famous</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Nullum numen habes si sit prudentia: nos te,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nos facimus, Fortuna, deam</i>,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>taken by Juvenal from the Greek. There are many unguarded phrases and at
least three corrections in Polybius.<A NAME="an_fr_133_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_133_1">133_1</A> Most interesting of all
perhaps, there is the first oration of Plutarch on the Fortune of
Alexander.<A NAME="an_fr_133_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_133_2">133_2</A> A sentence in Pliny's <i>Natural History</i>, ii. 22, seems
to go back to Hellenistic sources:</p>

<p><a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="green">p. 134</font></A> </p><div class="blockquot"><p>'Throughout the whole world, at every place and hour, by
every voice Fortune alone is invoked and her name spoken: she
is the one defendant, the one culprit, the one thought in
men's minds, the one object of praise, the one cause. She is
worshipped with insults, counted as fickle and often as blind,
wandering, inconsistent, elusive, changeful, and friend of the
unworthy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We are so much at the mercy of chance that Chance
is our god.'</p></div>

<p>The word used is first <i>Fortuna</i> and then <i>Sors</i>. This shows how little
real difference there is between the two apparently contradictory
conceptions.&mdash;'Chance would have it so.' 'It was fated to be.' The sting
of both phrases&mdash;their pleasant bitterness when played with, their
quality of poison when believed&mdash;lies in their denial of the value of
human endeavour.</p>

<p>Yet on the whole, as one might expect, the believers in Destiny are a
more respectable congregation than the worshippers of Chance. It
requires a certain amount of thoughtfulness to rise to the conception
that nothing really happens without a cause. It is the beginning,
perhaps, of science. Ionic philosophers of the fifth century had laid
stress on the <ins class="greek" title="Anank&ecirc; physios">&#7944;&#957;&#8049;&#947;&#954;&#951; &#966;&#8059;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962;</ins>,<A NAME="an_fr_134_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_134_1">134_1</A> what we should call the Chain of
causes in Nature. After the rise of Stoicism Fate becomes something less
physical, more related to conscious purpose. It is not <i>Anank&ecirc;</i> but
<i>Heimarmen&ecirc;</i>. Heimarmen&ecirc;, in the striking simile of Zeno,<A NAME="an_fr_134_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_134_2">134_2</A> is like
a fine thread running through the whole of existence&mdash;the world, we must
remember, was to the Stoics a live <a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="green">p. 135</font></A> thing&mdash;like that invisible thread of
life which, in heredity, passes on from generation to generation of
living species and keeps the type alive; it runs causing, causing for
ever, both the infinitesimal and the infinite. It is the <ins class="greek" title="Logos tou
Kosmou">&#923;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#922;&#8057;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#965;</ins>,<A NAME="an_fr_135_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_135_1">135_1</A> the <ins class="greek" title="Nous Dios">&#925;&#959;&#8166;&#962; &#916;&#953;&#8057;&#962;</ins>, the Reason of the World or the mind of
Zeus, rather difficult to distinguish from the Pronoia or Providence
which is the work of God and indeed the very essence of God. Thus it is
not really an external and alien force. For the human soul itself is a
fragment or effluence of the divine, and this Law of God is also the law
of man's own Phusis. As long as you act in accordance with your true
self you are complying with that divine <ins class="greek" title="Heimarmen&ecirc;">&#917;&#7985;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#951;</ins> or <ins class="greek" title="Pronoia">&#928;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;</ins>, whose
service is perfect freedom. Only when you are false to your own nature
and become a rebel against the kingdom of God which is within you, are
you dragged perforce behind the chariot-wheels. The doctrine is implied
in Cleanthes' celebrated Hymn to Destiny and is explained clearly by
Plotinus.<A NAME="an_fr_135_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_135_2">135_2</A></p>

<p>That is a noble conception. But the vulgar of course can turn Kismet
into a stupid idol, as easily as they can Fortune. And Epicurus may have
had some excuse for exclaiming that he would sooner be a slave to the
old gods of the vulgar, than to the Destiny of the philosophers.<A NAME="an_fr_135_3"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_135_3">135_3</A></p>

<p>So much for the result in superstitious minds of the denial, or rather
the removal, of the Olympian Gods. It landed men in the worship of
Fortune or of Fate.</p>

<p><a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="green">p. 136</font></A> </p><p>Next, let us consider what happened when, instead of merely rejecting
the Gods <i>en masse</i>, people tried carefully to collect what remained of
religion after the Olympian system fell.</p>

<p>Aristotle himself gives us a fairly clear answer. He held that the
origins of man's idea (<ins class="greek" title="ennoia">&#7956;&#957;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;</ins>) of the Divine were twofold,<A NAME="an_fr_136_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_136_1">136_1</A> the
phenomena of the sky and the phenomena of the human soul. It is very
much what Kant found two thousand years later. The spectacle of the vast
and ordered movements of the heavenly bodies are compared by him in a
famous fragment with the marching forth of Homer's armies before Troy.
Behind such various order and strength there must surely be a conscious
mind capable</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>It is only a step from this to regarding the sun, moon, and stars as
themselves divine, and it is a step which both Plato and Aristotle,
following Pythagoras and followed by the Stoics, take with confidence.
Chrysippus gives practically the same list of gods: 'the Sun, Moon, and
Stars; and Law: and men who have become Gods.'<A NAME="an_fr_136_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_136_2">136_2</A> Both the wandering
stars and the fixed stars are 'animate beings, divine and eternal',
self-acting subordinate gods. As to the divinity of the soul or the mind
of man, the earlier generations are shy about it. But in the later
Stoics it is itself a portion of the divine life. It shows this
ordinarily by its power of reason, and more conspicuously by becoming
<ins class="greek" title="entheos">&#7956;&#957;&#952;&#949;&#959;&#962;</ins>, or 'filled with God', in its exalted <a name="page_137"><font size="1" color="green">p. 137</font></A> moments of prevision,
ecstasy, and prophetic dreams. If reason itself is divine, there is
something else in the soul which is even higher than reason or at least
more surprisingly divine.</p>

<p>Let us follow the history of both these remaining substitutes for the
Olympian gods.</p>

<p>First for the Heavenly bodies. If they are to be made divine, we can
hardly stop there. The Earth is also a divine being. Old tradition has
always said so, and Plato has repeated it. And if Earth is divine, so
surely are the other elements, the <i>Stoicheia</i>, Water, Air, and above
all, Fire. For the Gods themselves are said by Plato to be made of fire,
and the Stars visibly are so. Though perhaps the heavenly Fire is really
not our Fire at all, but a <ins class="greek" title="pempton s&ocirc;ma">&#960;&#8051;&#956;&#960;&#964;&#959;&#957; &#963;&#8182;&#956;&#945;</ins>, a 'Fifth Body', seeing that
it seems not to burn nor the Stars to be consumed.</p>

<p>This is persuasive enough and philosophic; but whither has it led us?
Back to the Olympians, or rather behind the Olympians; as St. Paul puts
it (Gal. iv. 9), to 'the beggarly elements'. The old Kor&ecirc;, or Earth
Maiden and Mother, seems to have held her own unshaken by the changes of
time all over the Aegean area. She is there in prehistoric Crete with
her two lions; with the same lions orientalized in Olympia and Ephesus;
in Sparta with her great marsh birds; in Boeotia with her horse. She
runs riot in a number of the Gnostic systems both pre-Christian and
post-Christian. She forms a divine triad with the Father and the Son:
that is ancient and natural. But she also becomes the Divine Wisdom,
Sophia, the Divine Truth, Aletheia, the Holy Breath or Spirit, the
Pneuma. Since the word <a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="green">p. 138</font></A> for 'spirit' is neuter in Greek and masculine in
Latin, this last is rather a surprise. It is explained when we remember
that in Hebrew the word for Spirit, 'Ruah', is mostly feminine. In the
meantime let us notice one curious development in the life of this
goddess. In the old religion of Greece and Western Asia, she begins as a
Maiden, then in fullness of time becomes a mother. There is evidence
also for a third stage, the widowhood of withering autumn.<A NAME="an_fr_138_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_138_1">138_1</A> To the
classical Greek this motherhood was quite as it should be, a due
fulfilment of normal functions. But to the Gnostic and his kind it
connoted a 'fall', a passage from the glory of Virginity to a state of
Sin.<A NAME="an_fr_138_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_138_2">138_2</A> The Kor&ecirc; becomes a fallen Virgin, sometimes a temptress or
even a female devil; sometimes she has to be saved by her Son the
Redeemer.<A NAME="an_fr_138_3"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_138_3">138_3</A> As far as I have observed, she loses most of her
earthly agricultural quality, though as Selene or even Helen she keeps
up her affinity with the Moon.</p>

<p>Almost all the writers of the Hellenistic Age agree in regarding the
Sun, Moon, and Stars as gods. The rationalists Hecataeus and Euhemerus,
before going on to their deified men, always start with the heavenly
bodies. When Plutarch explains in his beautiful and kindly way that all
religions are really attempts towards the same goal, he clinches his
argument by <a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="green">p. 139</font></A> observing that we all see the same Sun and Moon though we
call them by different names in all languages.<A NAME="an_fr_139_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_139_1">139_1</A> But the belief
does not seem to have had much religious intensity in it, until it was
reinforced by two alien influences.</p>

<p>First, we have the ancient worship of the Sun, implicit, if not
explicit, in a great part of the oldest Greek rituals, and then
idealized by Plato in the <i>Republic</i>, where the Sun is the author of all
light and life in the material world, as the Idea of Good is in the
ideal world. This worship came gradually into contact with the
traditional and definite Sun-worship of Persia. The final combination
took place curiously late. It was the Roman conquests of Cilicia,
Cappadocia, Commagene, and Armenia that gave the decisive moment.<A NAME="an_fr_139_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_139_2">139_2</A>
To men who had wearied of the myths of the poets, who could draw no more
inspiration from their Apollo and Hyperion, but still had the habits and
the craving left by their old Gods, a fresh breath of reality came with
the entrance of <ins class="greek" title="H&ecirc;lios anik&ecirc;tos Mithras">&#7981;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#8055;&#954;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#924;&#8055;&#952;&#961;&#945;&#962;</ins>, 'Mithras, the Unconquered
Sun'. But long before the triumph of Mithraism as the military religion
of the Roman frontier, Greek literature is permeated with a kind of
intense language about the Sun, which seems derived from Plato.<A NAME="an_fr_139_3"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_139_3">139_3</A>
In later times, in the fourth century <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> for instance, it has
absorbed some more full-blooded and less critical element as well.</p>

<p><a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="green">p. 140</font></A> </p><p>Secondly, all the seven planets. These had a curious history. The
planets were of course divine and living bodies, so much Plato gave us.
Then come arguments and questions scattered through the Stoic and
eclectic literature. Is it the planet itself that is divine, or is the
planet under the guidance of a divine spirit? The latter seems to win
the day. Anthropomorphism has stolen back upon us: we can use the old
language and speak simply of the planet Mercury as <ins class="greek" title="H&ecirc;rmou ast&ecirc;r">&#7961;&#961;&#956;&#959;&#8166; &#7936;&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#961;</ins>. It is
the star of Hermes, and Hermes is the spirit who guides it.<A NAME="an_fr_140_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_140_1">140_1</A> Even
Plato in his old age had much to say about the souls of the seven
planets. Further, each planet has its sphere. The Earth is in the
centre, then comes the sphere of the Moon, then that of the Sun, and so
on through a range of seven spheres. If all things are full of gods, as
the wise ancients have said, what about those parts of the sphere in
which the shining planet for the moment is not? Are they without god?
Obviously not. The whole sphere is filled with innumerable spirits
everywhere. It is all Hermes, all Aphrodite. (We are more familiar with
the Latin names, Mercury and Venus.) But one part only is visible. The
voice of one school, as usual, is raised in opposition. One veteran had
seen clearly from the beginning whither all this sort of thing was sure
to lead. 'Epicurus approves none of these things.'<A NAME="an_fr_140_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_140_2">140_2</A> It was no
<a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="green">p. 141</font></A> good his having destroyed the old traditional superstition, if people
by deifying the stars were to fill the sky with seven times seven as
many objects of worship as had been there before. He allows no
<i>Schw&auml;rmerei</i> about the stars. They are <i>not</i> divine animate beings, or
guided by Gods. Why cannot the astrologers leave God in peace? When
their orbits are irregular it is <i>not</i> because they are looking for
food. They are just conglomerations of ordinary atoms of air or fire&mdash;it
does not matter which. They are not even very large&mdash;only about as large
as they look, or perhaps smaller, since most fires tend to look bigger
at a distance. They are not at all certainly everlasting. It is quite
likely that the sun comes to an end every day, and a new one rises in
the morning. All kinds of explanations are possible, and none certain.
<ins class="greek" title="Monon ho mythos apest&ocirc;.">&#924;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#8001; &#956;&#8166;&#952;&#959;&#962; &#7936;&#960;&#8051;&#963;&#964;&#969;.</ins> In any case, as you value your life and your
reason, do not begin making myths about them!</p>

<p>On other lines came what might have been the effective protest of real
Science, when Aristarchus of Samos (250 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>) argued that the earth was
not really the centre of the universe, but revolved round the Sun. But
his hypothesis did not account for the phenomena as completely as the
current theory with its 'Epicycles'; his fellow astronomers were against
him; Cleanthes the Stoic denounced him for 'disturbing the Hearth of the
Universe', and his heresy made little headway.<A NAME="an_fr_141_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_141_1">141_1</A></p>

<p>The planets in their seven spheres surrounding the earth continued to be
objects of adoration. They had their special gods or guiding spirits
assigned them. Their ordered movements through space, it was held,
<a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="green">p. 142</font></A> produce a vast and eternal harmony. It is beautiful beyond all earthly
music, this Music of the Spheres, beyond all human dreams of what music
might be. The only pity is that&mdash;except for a few individuals in
trances&mdash;nobody has ever heard it. Circumstances seem always to be
unfavourable. It may be that we are too far off, though, considering the
vastness of the orchestra, this seems improbable. More likely we are
merely deaf to it because it never stops and we have been in the middle
of it since we first drew breath.<A NAME="an_fr_142_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_142_1">142_1</A></p>

<p>The planets also become Elements in the Kosmos, <i>Stoicheia</i>. It is
significant that in Hellenistic theology the word Stoicheion, Element,
gets to mean a Daemon&mdash;as Megathos, Greatness, means an Angel.<A NAME="an_fr_142_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_142_2">142_2</A>
But behold a mystery! The word <i>Stoicheia</i>, 'elementa', had long been
used for the Greek A B C, and in particular for the seven vowels <ins class="greek" title="a">&#945;</ins> <ins class="greek" title="e">&#949;</ins> <ins class="greek" title="&ecirc;">&#951;</ins>
<ins class="greek" title="i">&#953;</ins> <ins class="greek" title="o">&#959;</ins> <ins class="greek" title="u">&#965;</ins> <ins class="greek" title="&ocirc;">&#969;</ins>. That is no chance, no mere coincidence. The vowels are the
mystic signs of the Planets; they have control over the planets. Hence
strange prayers and magic formulae innumerable.</p>

<p>Even the way of reckoning time changed under the influence of the
Planets. Instead of the old division of the month into three periods of
nine days, we find gradually establishing itself the week of seven days
with each day named after its planet, Sun, Moon, Ares, Hermes, Zeus,
Aphrodite, Kronos. The history of the Planet week is given by Dio
Cassius, xxxvii. 18, <a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="green">p. 143</font></A> in his account of the Jewish campaign of Pompeius.
But it was not the Jewish week. The Jews scorned such idolatrous and
polytheistic proceedings. It was the old week of Babylon, the original
home of astronomy and planet-worship.<A NAME="an_fr_143_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_143_1">143_1</A></p>

<p>For here again a great foreign religion came like water in the desert to
minds reluctantly and superficially enlightened, but secretly longing
for the old terrors and raptures from which they had been set free. Even
in the old days Aeschylus had called the planets 'bright potentates,
shining in the fire of heaven', and Euripides had spoken of the 'shaft
hurled from a star'.<A NAME="an_fr_143_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_143_2">143_2</A> But we are told that the first teaching of
astrology in Hellenic lands was in the time of Alexander, when B&ecirc;r&ocirc;ssos
the Chaldaean set up a school in Cos and, according to Seneca, <i>Belum
interpretatus est</i>. This must mean that he translated into Greek the
'<i>Eye of Bel</i>', a treatise in seventy tablets found in the library of
Assur-bani-pal (686-626 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>) but composed for Sargon I in the third
millennium <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> Even the philosopher Theophrastus is reported by
Proclus<A NAME="an_fr_143_3"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_143_3">143_3</A> as saying that 'the most extraordinary thing of his age
was the lore of the Chaldaeans, who foretold not only events of public
interest but even the lives and deaths of individuals'. One wonders
slightly whether Theophrastus spoke with as much implicit faith as
Proclus suggests. But the chief account is given by Diodorus, ii. 30
(perhaps from Hecataeus).</p>

<p><a name="page_144"><font size="1" color="green">p. 144</font></A> </p><div class="blockquot"><p>'Other nations despise the philosophy of Greece. It is so
recent and so constantly changing. They have traditions which
come from vast antiquity and never change. Notably the
Chaldaeans have collected observations of the Stars through
long ages, and teach how every event in the heavens has its
meaning, as part of the eternal scheme of divine forethought.
Especially the seven Wanderers, or Planets, are called by them
Herm&ecirc;neis, Interpreters: and among them the Interpreter in
chief is Saturn. Their work is to interpret beforehand <ins class="greek" title="t&ecirc;n
t&ocirc;n the&ocirc;n ennoian">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#952;&#949;&#8182;&#957; &#7956;&#957;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;&#957;</ins>, the thought that is in the mind of the
Gods. By their risings and settings, and by the colours they
assume, the Chaldaeans predict great winds and storms and
waves of excessive heat, comets, and earthquakes, and in
general all changes fraught with weal or woe not only to
nations and regions of the world, but to kings and to ordinary
men and women. Beneath the Seven are thirty Gods of Counsel,
half below and half above the Earth; every ten days a
Messenger or Angel star passes from above below and another
from below above. Above these gods are twelve Masters, who are
the twelve signs of the Zodiac; and the planets pass through
all the Houses of these twelve in turn. The Chaldaeans have
made prophecies for various kings, such as Alexander who
conquered Darius, and Antigonus and Seleucus Nikator, and have
always been right. And private persons who have consulted them
consider their wisdom as marvellous and above human power.'</p></div>

<p>Astrology fell upon the Hellenistic mind as a new disease falls upon
some remote island people. The tomb of Ozymandias, as described by
Diodorus (i. 49, 5), was covered with astrological symbols, and that of
Antiochus I, which has been discovered in Commagene, is of the same
character. It was natural for monarchs to believe that the stars watched
<a name="page_145"><font size="1" color="green">p. 145</font></A> over them. But every one was ready to receive the germ. The Epicureans,
of course, held out, and so did Panaetius, the coolest head among the
Stoics. But the Stoics as a whole gave way. They formed with good reason
the leading school of philosophy, and it would have been a service to
mankind if they had resisted. But they were already committed to a
belief in the deity of the stars and to the doctrine of Heimarmen&ecirc;, or
Destiny. They believed in the pervading Pronoia,<A NAME="an_fr_145_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_145_1">145_1</A> or Forethought,
of the divine mind, and in the <ins class="greek" title="Sympatheia t&ocirc;n hol&ocirc;n">&#931;&#965;&#956;&#960;&#8049;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#8005;&#955;&#969;&#957;</ins>&mdash;the Sympathy of
all Creation,<A NAME="an_fr_145_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_145_2">145_2</A> whereby whatever happens to any one part, however
remote or insignificant, affects all the rest. It seemed only a natural
and beautiful illustration of this Sympathy that the movements of the
Stars should be bound up with the sufferings of man. They also appealed
to the general belief in prophecy and divination.<A NAME="an_fr_145_3"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_145_3">145_3</A> If a prophet
can foretell that such and such an event will happen, then it is
obviously fated to happen. Foreknowledge implies Predestination. This
belief in prophecy was, in reality, a sort of appeal to fact and to
common sense. People could produce then, as they can now, a large number
of striking cases of second sight, presentiment, clairvoyance, actual
prophecy and the like;<A NAME="an_fr_145_4"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_145_4">145_4</A> and it was more difficult then to test
them.</p>

<p><a name="page_146"><font size="1" color="green">p. 146</font></A> </p><p>The argument involved Stoicism with some questionable allies.
Epicureans and sceptics of the Academy might well mock at the sight of a
great man like Chrysippus or Posidonius resting an important part of his
religion on the undetected frauds of a shady Levantine 'medium'. Still
the Stoics could not but welcome the arrival of a system of prophecy and
predestination which, however the incredulous might rail at it,
possessed at least great antiquity and great stores of learning, which
was respectable, recondite, and in a way sublime.</p>

<p>In all the religious systems of later antiquity, if I mistake not, the
Seven Planets play some lordly or terrifying part. The great Mithras
Liturgy, unearthed by Dieterich from a magical papyrus in Paris,<A NAME="an_fr_146_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_146_1">146_1</A>
repeatedly confronts the worshipper with the seven vowels as names of
'the Seven Deathless Kosmokratores', or Lords of the Universe, and
seems, under their influence, to go off into its 'Seven Maidens with
heads of serpents, in white raiment', and its divers other Sevens. The
various Hermetic and Mithraic communities, the Naassenes described by
Hippolytus,<A NAME="an_fr_146_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_146_2">146_2</A> and other Gnostic bodies, authors like Macrobius and
even Cicero in his <i>Somnium Scipionis</i>, are full of the influence of the
seven planets and of the longing to escape beyond them. For by some
simple psychological law the stars which have inexorably pronounced our
fate, and decreed, or at least registered <a name="page_147"><font size="1" color="green">p. 147</font></A> the decree, that in spite of
all striving we must needs tread their prescribed path; still more
perhaps, the Stars who know in the midst of our laughter how that
laughter will end, become inevitably powers of evil rather than good,
beings malignant as well as pitiless, making life a vain thing. And
Saturn, the chief of them, becomes the most malignant. To some of the
Gnostics he becomes Jaldabaoth, the Lion-headed God, the evil
Jehovah.<A NAME="an_fr_147_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_147_1">147_1</A> The religion of later antiquity is overpoweringly
absorbed in plans of escape from the prison of the seven planets.</p>

<p>In author after author, in one community after another, the subject
recurs. And on the whole there is the same answer. Here on the earth we
are the sport of Fate; nay, on the earth itself we are worse off still.
We are beneath the Moon, and beneath the Moon there is not only Fate but
something more unworthy and equally malignant, Chance&mdash;to say nothing of
damp and the ills of earth and bad daemons. Above the Moon there is no
chance, only Necessity: there is the will of the other six
Kosmokratores, Rulers of the Universe. But above them all there is an
Eighth region&mdash;they call it simply the Ogdoas&mdash;the home of the ultimate
God,<A NAME="an_fr_147_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_147_2">147_2</A> whatever He is named, whose being was before the Kosmos. In
this Sphere is true Being and Freedom. And more than freedom, there is
the ultimate Union with God. For that spark of divine life which is
man's soul is not merely, as some have said, an <ins class="greek" title="aporroia t&ocirc;n astr&ocirc;n">&#7936;&#960;&#8057;&#961;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#945; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7940;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#969;&#957;</ins>,
an effluence of the stars: it comes direct from the first and ultimate
<a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="green">p. 148</font></A> God, the Alpha and Omega, who is beyond the Planets. Though the
Kosmokratores cast us to and fro like their slaves or dead chattels, in
soul at least we are of equal birth with them. The Mithraic votary, when
their wrathful and tremendous faces break in upon his vision, answers
them unterrified: <ins class="greek" title="eg&ocirc; eimi symplanos hymin ast&ecirc;r">&#7952;&#947;&#8061; &#949;&#7984;&#956;&#953; &#963;&#8059;&#956;&#960;&#955;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957; &#7936;&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#961;</ins>, 'I am your fellow
wanderer, your fellow Star.' The Orphic carried to the grave on his
golden scroll the same boast: first, 'I am the child of Earth and of the
starry Heaven'; then later, 'I too am become God'.<A NAME="an_fr_148_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_148_1">148_1</A> The Gnostic
writings consist largely of charms to be uttered by the Soul to each of
the Planets in turn, as it pursues its perilous path past all of them to
its ultimate home.</p>

<p>That journey awaits us after death; but in the meantime? In the meantime
there are initiations, sacraments, mystic ways of communion with God. To
see God face to face is, to the ordinary unprepared man, sheer death.
But to see Him after due purification, to be led to Him along the true
Way by an initiating Priest, is the ultimate blessing of human life. It
is to die and be born again. There were regular official initiations. We
have one in the Mithras-Liturgy, more than one in the Corpus Hermeticum.
Apuleius<A NAME="an_fr_148_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_148_2">148_2</A> tells us at some length, though in guarded language, how
he was initiated to Isis and became 'her image'. After much fasting,
clad in holy garments and led by the High Priest, he crossed the
threshold of Death and passed through all the Elements. The Sun shone
upon him at midnight, and he saw the Gods of Heaven and of Hades. In the
morning he was clad <a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="green">p. 149</font></A> in the Robe of Heaven, set up on a pedestal in
front of the Goddess and worshipped by the congregation as a God. He had
been made one with Osiris or Horus or whatever name it pleased that
Sun-God to be called. Apuleius does not reveal it.</p>

<p>There were also, of course, the irregular personal initiations and
visions of god vouchsafed to persons of special prophetic powers. St.
Paul, we may remember, knew personally a man who had actually been
snatched up into the Third Heaven, and another who was similarly rapt
into Paradise, where he heard unspeakable words;<A NAME="an_fr_149_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_149_1">149_1</A> whether in the
body or not, the apostle leaves undecided. He himself on the road to
Damascus had seen the Christ in glory, not after the flesh. The
philosopher Plotinus, so his disciple tells us, was united with God in
trance four times in five years.<A NAME="an_fr_149_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_149_2">149_2</A></p>

<p>We seem to have travelled far from the simplicity <a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="green">p. 150</font></A> of early Greek
religion. Yet, apart always from Plotinus, who is singularly aloof, most
of the movement has been a reaction under Oriental and barbarous
influences towards the most primitive pre-Hellenic cults. The union of
man with God came regularly through <i>Ekstasis</i>&mdash;the soul must get clear
of its body&mdash;and <i>Enthousiasmos</i>&mdash;the God must enter and dwell inside
the worshipper. But the means to this union, while sometimes allegorized
and spiritualized to the last degree, are sometimes of the most
primitive sort. The vagaries of religious emotion are apt to reach very
low as well as very high in the scale of human nature. Certainly the
primitive Thracian savages, who drank themselves mad with the hot blood
of their God-beast, would have been quite at home in some of these
rituals, though in others they would have been put off with some
substitute for the actual blood. The primitive priestesses who waited in
a bridal chamber for the Divine Bridegroom, even the Cretan Kour&ecirc;tes
with their Zeus Kour&ecirc;s<A NAME="an_fr_150_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_150_1">150_1</A> and those strange hierophants of the
'Men's House' whose initiations are written on the rocks of Thera, would
have found rites very like their own reblossoming on earth after the
fall of Hellenism. 'Prepare thyself as a bride to receive her
bridegroom,' says Markos the Gnostic,<A NAME="an_fr_150_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_150_2">150_2</A> 'that thou mayst be what I
am and I what thou art.' 'I in thee, and thou in me!' is the ecstatic
cry of one of the Hermes liturgies. Before that the prayer has been
'Enter into me as a babe into the womb of a woman'.<A NAME="an_fr_150_3"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_150_3">150_3</A></p>

<p><a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="green">p. 151</font></A> </p><p>In almost all the liturgies that I have read need is felt for a
mediator between the seeker after God and his goal. Mithras himself saw
a Mes&icirc;t&ecirc;s, a Mediator, between Ormuzd and Ahriman, but the ordinary
mediator is more like an interpreter or an adept with inner knowledge
which he reveals to the outsider. The circumstances out of which these
systems grew have left their mark on the new gods themselves. As usual,
the social structure of the worshippers is reflected in their objects of
worship. When the Chaldaeans came to Cos, when the Thracians in the
Piraeus set up their national worship of Bendis, when the Egyptians in
the same port founded their society for the Egyptian ritual of Isis,
when the Jews at Assuan in the fifth century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> established their own
temple, in each case there would come proselytes to whom the truth must
be explained and interpreted, sometimes perhaps softened. And in each
case there is behind the particular priest or initiator there present
some greater authority in the land he comes from. Behind any explanation
that can be made in the Piraeus, there is a deeper and higher
explanation known only to the great master in Jerusalem, in Egypt, in
Babylon, or perhaps in some unexplored and ever-receding region of the
east. This series of revelations, one behind the other, is a
characteristic of all these mixed Graeco-Oriental religions.</p>

<p>Most of the Hermetic treatises are put in the form of initiations or
lessons revealed by a 'father' to a 'son', by Ptah to Hermes, by Hermes
to Thoth or Asclepios, and by one of them to us. It was an ancient
formula, a natural vehicle for traditional wisdom in Egypt, where the
young priest became regularly the 'son' of the old priest. It is a form
<a name="page_152"><font size="1" color="green">p. 152</font></A> that we find in Greece itself as early as Euripides, whose Melanippe
says of her cosmological doctrines,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'It is not my word but my Mother's word'.<A NAME="an_fr_152_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_152_1">152_1</A><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was doubtless the language of the old Medicine-Man to his disciple.
In one fine liturgy Thoth wrestles with Hermes in agony of spirit, till
Hermes is forced to reveal to him the path to union with God which he
himself has trodden before. At the end of the Mithras liturgy the
devotee who has passed through the mystic ordeals and seen his god face
to face, is told: 'After this you can show the way to others.'</p>

<p>But this leads us to the second great division of our subject. We turn
from the phenomena of the sky to those of the soul.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>If what I have written elsewhere is right, one of the greatest works of
the Hellenic spirit, and especially of fifth-century Athens, was to
insist on what seems to us such a commonplace truism, the difference
between Man and God. Sophrosyn&ecirc; in religion was the message of the
classical age. But the ages before and after had no belief in such a
lesson. The old Medicine-Man was perhaps himself the first <i>Theos</i>. At
any rate the primeval kings and queens were treated as divine.<A NAME="an_fr_152_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_152_2">152_2</A>
Just for a few great generations, it would seem, humanity rose to a
sufficient height of self-criticism <a name="page_153"><font size="1" color="green">p. 153</font></A> and self-restraint to reject these
dreams of self-abasement or megalomania. But the effort was too great
for the average world; and in a later age nearly all the kings and
rulers&mdash;all people in fact who can command an adequate number of
flatterers&mdash;become divine beings again. Let us consider how it came
about.</p>

<p>First there was the explicit recognition by the soberest philosophers of
the divine element in man's soul.<A NAME="an_fr_153_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_153_1">153_1</A> Aristotle himself built an
altar to Plato. He did nothing superstitious; he did not call Plato a
god, but we can see from his beautiful elegy to Eudemus, that he
naturally and easily used language of worship which would seem a little
strange to us. It is the same emotion&mdash;a noble and just emotion on the
whole&mdash;which led the philosophic schools to treat their founders as
'heroes', and which has peopled most of Europe and Asia with the
memories and the worship of saints. But we should remember that only a
rare mind will make its divine man of such material as Plato. The common
way to dazzle men's eyes is a more brutal and obvious one.</p>

<p>To people who were at all accustomed to the conception of a God-Man it
was difficult not to feel that the conception was realized in Alexander.
His tremendous power, his brilliant personality, his achievements
beggaring the fables of the poets, put people in the right mind for
worship. Then came the fact that the kings whom he conquered were, as a
matter of fact, mostly regarded by their subjects as <a name="page_154"><font size="1" color="green">p. 154</font></A> divine
beings.<A NAME="an_fr_154_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_154_1">154_1</A> It was easy, it was almost inevitable, for those who
worshipped the 'God'<A NAME="an_fr_154_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_154_2">154_2</A> Darius to feel that it was no man but a
greater god who had overthrown Darius. The incense which had been burned
before those conquered gods was naturally offered to their conqueror. He
did not refuse it. It was not good policy to do so, and
self-depreciation is not apt to be one of the weaknesses of the born
ruler.<A NAME="an_fr_154_3"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_154_3">154_3</A> But besides all this, if you are to judge a God by his
fruits, what God could produce better credentials? Men had often seen
Zeus defied with impunity; they had seen faithful servants of Apollo
come to bad ends. But those who defied Alexander, however great they
might be, always rued their defiance, and those who were faithful to him
always received their reward. With his successors the worship became
more official. Seleucus, Ptolemaeus, Antigonus, Demetrius, all in
different degrees and different styles are deified by the acclamations
of adoring subjects. Ptolemy Philadelphus seems to have been the first
to claim definite divine honours during his own life. On the death of
his wife in 271 he proclaimed her deity and his own as well in the
worship of the Theoi Adelphoi, the 'Gods Brethren'. Of course there was
flattery in all this, ordinary self-interested lying flattery, and its
<a name="page_155"><font size="1" color="green">p. 155</font></A> inevitable accompaniment, megalomania. Any reading of the personal
history of the Ptolemies, the Seleucidae or the Caesars shows it. But
that is not the whole explanation.</p>

<p>One of the characteristics of the period of the Diadochi is the
accumulation of capital and military force in the hands of individuals.
The Ptolemies and Seleucidae had at any moment at their disposal powers
very much greater than any Pericles or Nicias or Lysander.<A NAME="an_fr_155_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_155_1">155_1</A> The
folk of the small cities of the Aegean hinterlands must have felt
towards these great strangers almost as poor Indian peasants in time of
flood and famine feel towards an English official. There were men now on
earth who could do the things that had hitherto been beyond the power of
man. Were several cities thrown down by earthquake; here was one who by
his nod could build them again. Famines had always occurred and been
mostly incurable. Here was one who could without effort allay a famine.
Provinces were harried and wasted by habitual wars: the eventual
conqueror had destroyed whole provinces in making the wars; now, as he
had destroyed, he could also save. 'What do you mean by a god,' the
simple man might say, 'if these men are not gods? The only difference is
that these gods are visible, and the old gods no man has seen.'</p>

<p>The titles assumed by all the divine kings tell the story clearly.
Antiochus Epiphan&ecirc;s&mdash;'the god made manifest'; Ptolemaios Euerget&ecirc;s,
Ptolemaios S&ocirc;t&ecirc;r. Occasionally we have a Keraunos or a Nikator, a
<a name="page_156"><font size="1" color="green">p. 156</font></A> 'Thunderbolt' or a 'God of Mana', but mostly it is S&ocirc;t&ecirc;r, Euerget&ecirc;s and
Epiphan&ecirc;s, the Saviour, the Benefactor, the God made manifest, in
constant alternation. In the honorific inscriptions and in the writings
of the learned, philanthropy (<ins class="greek" title="philanthr&ocirc;pia">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#8055;&#945;</ins>) is by far the most
prominent characteristic of the God upon earth. Was it that people
really felt that to save or benefit mankind was a more godlike thing
than to blast and destroy them? Philosophers have generally said that,
and the vulgar pretended to believe them. It was at least politic, when
ministering to the half-insane pride of one of these princes, to remind
him of his mercy rather than of his wrath.</p>

<p>Wendland in his brilliant book, <i>Hellenistisch-r&ouml;mische Kultur</i>, calls
attention to an inscription of the year 196 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> in honour of the young
Ptolemaios Epiphan&ecirc;s, who was made manifest at the age of twelve
years.<A NAME="an_fr_156_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_156_1">156_1</A> It is a typical document of Graeco-Egyptian king-worship:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'In the reign of the young king by inheritance from his
Father, Lord of the Diadems, great in glory, pacificator of
Egypt and pious towards the gods, superior over his
adversaries, Restorer of the life of man, Lord of the Periods
of Thirty Years, like Hephaistos the Great, King like the Sun,
the Great King of the Upper and Lower Lands; offspring of the
Gods of the Love of the Father, whom Hephaistos has approved,
to whom the Sun has given Victory; living image of Zeus; Son
of the Sun, Ptolemaios the ever-living, beloved by Phtha; in
the ninth year of A&euml;tos son of A&euml;tos, Priest of Alexander and
the Gods Saviours and the Gods Brethren and the Gods
<a name="page_157"><font size="1" color="green">p. 157</font></A> Benefactors and the Gods of the Love of the Father and the
God Manifest for whom thanks be given:'</p></div>

<p>The Priests who came to his coronation ceremony at Memphis proclaim:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Seeing that King Ptolemaios ever-living, beloved of Phtha,
God Manifest for whom Thanks be given, born of King Ptolemaios
and Queen Arsinoe, the Gods of the Love of the Father, has
done many benefactions to the Temples and those in them and
all those beneath his rule, being from the beginning God born
of God and Goddess, like Horus son of Isis and Osiris, who
came to the help of his father Osiris (and?) in his benevolent
disposition towards the Gods has consecrated to the temples
revenues of silver and of corn, and has undergone many
expenses in order to lead Egypt into the sunlight and give
peace to the Temples, and has with all his powers shown love
of mankind.'</p></div>

<p>When the people of Lycopolis revolted, we hear:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'in a short time he took the city by storm and slew all the
Impious who dwelt in it, even as Hermes and Horus, son of Isis
and Osiris, conquered those who of old revolted in the same
regions .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in return for which the Gods have granted him
Health Victory Power and all other good things, the Kingdom
remaining to him and his sons for time everlasting.'<A NAME="an_fr_157_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_157_1">157_1</A></p></div>

<p><a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="green">p. 158</font></A> </p><p>The conclusion which the Priests draw from these facts is that the
young king's titles and honours are insufficient and should be
increased. It is a typical and terribly un-Hellenic document of the
Hellenistic God-man in his appearance as King.</p>

<p>Now the early successors of Alexander mostly professed themselves
members of the Stoic school, and in the mouth of a Stoic this doctrine
of the potential divinity of man was an inspiring one. To them virtue
was the really divine thing in man; and the most divine kind of virtue
was that of helping humanity. To love and help humanity is, according to
Stoic doctrine, the work and the very essence of God. If you take away
Pronoia from God, says Chrysippus,<A NAME="an_fr_158_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_158_1">158_1</A> it is like taking away light
and heat from fire. This doctrine is magnificently expressed by Pliny in
a phrase that is probably translated from Posidonius: 'God is the
helping of man by man; and that is the way to eternal glory.'<A NAME="an_fr_158_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_158_2">158_2</A></p>

<p>The conception took root in the minds of many Romans. A great Roman
governor often had the chance of thus helping humanity on a vast scale,
and liked to think that such a life opened the way to heaven. 'One
should conceive', says Cicero (<i>Tusc.</i> i. <a name="page_159"><font size="1" color="green">p. 159</font></A> 32), 'the gods as like men
who feel themselves born for the work of helping, defending, and saving
humanity. Hercules has passed into the number of the gods. He would
never have so passed if he had not built up that road for himself while
he was among mankind.'</p>

<p>I have been using some rather late authors, though the ideas seem
largely to come from Posidonius.<A NAME="an_fr_159_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_159_1">159_1</A> But before Posidonius the sort
of fact on which we have been dwelling had had its influence on
religious speculation. When Alexander made his conquering journey to
India and afterwards was created a god, it was impossible not to reflect
that almost exactly the same story was related in myth about Dionysus.
Dionysus had started from India and travelled in the other direction:
that was the only difference. A flood of light seemed to be thrown on
all the traditional mythology, which, of course, had always been a
puzzle to thoughtful men. It was impossible to believe it as it stood,
and yet hard&mdash;in an age which had not the conception of any science of
mythology&mdash;to think it was all a mass of falsehood, and the great Homer
and Hesiod no better than liars. But the generation which witnessed the
official deification of the various Seleucidae and Ptolemies seemed
suddenly to see light. The traditional gods, from Heracles and Dionysus
up to Zeus and Cronos and even Ouranos, were simply old-world rulers and
benefactors of mankind, who had, by their own <a name="page_160"><font size="1" color="green">p. 160</font></A> insistence or the
gratitude of their subjects, been transferred to the ranks of heaven.
For that is the exact meaning of making them divine: they are classed
among the true immortals, the Sun and Moon and Stars and Corn and Wine,
and the everlasting elements.</p>

<p>The philosophic romance of Euhemerus, published early in the third
century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, had instantaneous success and enormous influence.<A NAME="an_fr_160_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_160_1">160_1</A>
It was one of the first Greek books translated into Latin, and became
long afterwards a favourite weapon of the Christian fathers in their
polemics against polytheism. 'Euhemerism' was, on the face of it, a very
brilliant theory; and it had, as we have noticed, a special appeal for
the Romans.</p>

<p>Yet, if such a conception might please the leisure of a statesman, it
could hardly satisfy the serious thought of a philosopher or a religious
man. If man's soul really holds a fragment of God and is itself a divine
being, its godhead cannot depend on the possession of great riches and
armies and organized subordinates. If 'the helping of man by man is
God', the help in question cannot be material help. The religion which
ends in deifying only kings and millionaires may be vulgarly popular but
is self-condemned.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the whole tendency of Greek philosophy after Plato,
with some illustrious exceptions, especially among the Romanizing
Stoics, was away from the outer world towards the world of the soul. We
find in the religious writings of this period that the real Saviour of
men is not he who protects <a name="page_161"><font size="1" color="green">p. 161</font></A> them against earthquake and famine, but he
who in some sense saves their souls. He reveals to them the <i>Gn&ocirc;sis
Theou</i>, the Knowledge of God. The 'knowledge' in question is not a mere
intellectual knowledge. It is a complete union, a merging of beings.
And, as we have always to keep reminding our cold modern intelligence,
he who has 'known' God is himself thereby deified. He is the Image of
God, the Son of God, in a sense he <i>is</i> God.<A NAME="an_fr_161_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_161_1">161_1</A> The stratum of ideas
described in the first of the studies will explain the ease with which
transition took place. The worshipper of Bacchos became Bacchos simply
enough, because in reality the God Bacchos was originally only the
projection of the human Bacchoi. And in the Hellenistic age the notion
of these secondary mediating gods was made easier by the analogy of the
human interpreters. Of course, we have abundant instances of actual
preachers and miracle-workers who on their own authority posed, and were
accepted, as gods. The adventure of Paul and Barnabas at Lystra<A NAME="an_fr_161_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_161_2">161_2</A>
shows how easily such things could happen. But as a rule, I suspect, the
most zealous priest or preacher preferred to have his God in the
background. He preaches, he heals the sick and casts out devils, not in
his own name but in the name of One who sent him. This actual present
priest who initiates you or me is himself already an Image of God; but
above him there are greater and <a name="page_162"><font size="1" color="green">p. 162</font></A> wiser priests, above them others, and
above all there is the one eternal Divine Mediator, who being in
perfection both man and God can alone fully reveal God to man, and lead
man's soul up the heavenly path, beyond Change and Fate and the Houses
of the Seven Rulers, to its ultimate peace. I have seen somewhere a
Gnostic or early Christian emblem which indicates this doctrine. Some
Shepherd or Saviour stands, his feet on the earth, his head towering
above the planets, lifting his follower in his outstretched arms.</p>

<p>The Gnostics are still commonly thought of as a body of Christian
heretics. In reality there were Gnostic sects scattered over the
Hellenistic world before Christianity as well as after. They must have
been established in Antioch and probably in Tarsus well before the days
of Paul or Apollos. Their Saviour, like the Jewish Messiah, was
established in men's minds before the Saviour of the Christians. 'If we
look close', says Professor Bousset, 'the result emerges with great
clearness, that the figure of the Redeemer as such did not wait for
Christianity to force its way into the religion of Gn&ocirc;sis, but was
already present there under various forms.'<A NAME="an_fr_162_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_162_1">162_1</A> He occurs notably in
two pre-Christian documents, discovered by the keen analysis and
profound learning of Dr. Reitzenstein: the Poimandres revelation printed
in the <i>Corpus Hermeticum</i>, and the sermon of the Naassenes in
Hippolytus, <i>Refutatio Omnium Haeresium</i>, which is combined with
Attis-worship.<A NAME="an_fr_162_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_162_2">162_2</A> The violent anti-Jewish bias of most of the
sects&mdash;they <a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="green">p. 163</font></A> speak of 'the accursed God of the Jews' and identify him
with Saturn and the Devil&mdash;points on the whole to pre-Christian
conditions: and a completely non-Christian standpoint is still visible
in the Mandaean and Manichean systems.</p>

<p>Their Redeemer is descended by a fairly clear genealogy from the 'Tritos
S&ocirc;t&ecirc;r' of early Greece, contaminated with similar figures, like Attis
and Adonis from Asia Minor, Osiris from Egypt, and the special Jewish
conception of the Messiah of the Chosen people. He has various names,
which the name of Jesus or 'Christos', 'the Anointed', tends gradually
to supersede. Above all he is, in some sense, Man, or 'the Second Man'
or 'the Son of Man'. The origin of this phrase needs a word of
explanation. Since the ultimate unseen God, spirit though He is, made
man in His image, since holy men (and divine kings) are images of God,
it follows that He is Himself Man. He is the real, the ultimate, the
perfect and eternal Man, of whom all bodily men are feeble copies. He is
also the Father; the Saviour is his Son, 'the Image of the Father', 'the
Second Man', 'the Son of Man'. The method in which he performs his
mystery of Redemption varies. It is haunted by the memory of the old
Suffering and Dying God, of whom we spoke in the first of these studies.
It is vividly affected by the ideal 'Righteous Man' of Plato, who 'shall
be scourged, tortured, bound, his eyes burnt out, and at last, after
suffering every evil, shall be impaled or crucified'.<A NAME="an_fr_163_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_163_1">163_1</A> But in <a name="page_164"><font size="1" color="green">p. 164</font></A> the
main he descends, of his free will or by the eternal purpose of the
Father, from Heaven through the spheres of all the Archontes or
Kosmokratores, the planets, to save mankind, or sometimes to save the
fallen Virgin, the Soul, Wisdom, or 'the Pearl'.<A NAME="an_fr_164_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_164_1">164_1</A> The Archontes
let him pass because he is disguised; they do not know him (cf. 1 Cor.
ii. 7 ff.). When his work is done he ascends to Heaven to sit by the
side of the Father in glory; he conquers the Archontes, leads them
captive in his triumph, strips them of their armour (Col. ii. 15; cf.
the previous verse), sometimes even crucifies them for ever in their
places in the sky.<A NAME="an_fr_164_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_164_2">164_2</A> The epistles to the Colossians and the
Ephesians are much influenced by these doctrines. Paul himself
constantly uses the language of them, but in the main we find him
discouraging the excesses of superstition, reforming, ignoring,
rejecting. His Jewish blood was perhaps enough to keep him to strict
monotheism. Though he admits Angels and Archontes, Principalities and
Powers, he scorns the Elements and he seems deliberately to reverse the
doctrine of the first and second Man.<A NAME="an_fr_164_3"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_164_3">164_3</A> He says nothing about the
Trinity of Divine Beings that was usual in Gnosticism, nothing about the
Divine Mother. His mind, for all its vehement mysticism, has something
of that clean antiseptic quality that makes such early Christian works
as the Octavius of Minucius Felix and the Epistle to Diognetus so
infinitely refreshing. He is certainly one of the great figures in Greek
literature, but his system lies <a name="page_165"><font size="1" color="green">p. 165</font></A> outside the subject of this essay. We
are concerned only with those last manifestations of Hellenistic
religion which probably formed the background of his philosophy. It is a
strange experience, and it shows what queer stuff we humans are made of,
to study these obscure congregations, drawn from the proletariate of the
Levant, superstitious, charlatan-ridden, and helplessly ignorant, who
still believed in Gods begetting children of mortal mothers, who took
the 'Word', the 'Spirit', and the 'Divine Wisdom', to be persons called
by those names, and turned the Immortality of the Soul into 'the
standing up of the corpses';<A NAME="an_fr_165_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_165_1">165_1</A> and to reflect that it was these who
held the main road of advance towards the greatest religion of the
western world.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I have tried to sketch in outline the main forms of belief to which
Hellenistic philosophy moved or drifted. Let me dwell for a few pages
more upon the characteristic method by which it reached them. It may be
summed up in one word, Allegory. All Hellenistic philosophy from the
first Stoics onward is permeated by allegory. It is applied to Homer, to
the religious traditions, to the ancient rituals, to the whole world. To
Sallustius after the end of our period the whole material world is only
a great myth, a thing whose value lies not in itself but in the
spiritual meaning which it hides and reveals. To Cleanthes at the
beginning of it the Universe was a mystic pageant, in which the immortal
stars were the dancers and the Sun the priestly torch-bearer.<A NAME="an_fr_165_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_165_2">165_2</A>
<a name="page_166"><font size="1" color="green">p. 166</font></A> Chrysippus reduced the Homeric gods to physical or ethical principles;
and Crates, the great critic, applied allegory in detail to his
interpretation of the all-wise poet.<A NAME="an_fr_166_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_166_1">166_1</A> We possess two small but
complete treatises which illustrate well the results of this tendency,
Cornutus <ins class="greek" title="peri the&ocirc;n">&#961;&#949;&#960;&#8054; &#952;&#949;&#8182;&#957;</ins> and the <i>Homeric Allegories</i> of Heraclitus, a
brilliant little work of the first century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> I will not dwell upon
details: they are abundantly accessible and individually often
ridiculous. A by-product of the same activity is the mystic treatment of
language: a certain Titan in Hesiod is named Koios. Why? Because the
Titans are the elements and one of them is naturally the element of
<ins class="greek" title="Koiot&ecirc;s">&#922;&#959;&#953;&#8057;&#964;&#951;&#962;</ins>, the Ionic Greek for 'Quality'. The Egyptian Isis is derived
from the root of the Greek <ins class="greek" title="eidenai">&#949;&#7984;&#948;&#8051;&#957;&#945;&#953;</ins>, Knowledge, and the Egyptian Osiris
from the Greek <ins class="greek" title="hosios">&#8005;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962;</ins> and <ins class="greek" title="hiros">&#7985;&#961;&#8057;&#962;</ins> ('holy' and 'sacred', or perhaps
more exactly 'lawful' and '<i>tabu</i>'). Is this totally absurd? I think
not. If all human language is, as most of these thinkers believed, a
divine institution, a cap filled to the brim with divine meaning, so
that by reflecting deeply upon a word a pious philosopher can reach the
secret that it holds, then there is no difficulty whatever in supposing
that the special secret held by an Egyptian word may be found in Greek,
or the secret of a Greek word in Babylonian. Language is One. The Gods
who made all these languages equally could use them all, and wind them
all intricately in and out, for the building up of their divine enigma.</p>

<p>We must make a certain effort of imagination to understand this method
of allegory. It is not the <a name="page_167"><font size="1" color="green">p. 167</font></A> frigid thing that it seems to us. In the
first place, we should remember that, as applied to the ancient
literature and religious ritual, allegory was at least a <i>vera
causa</i>&mdash;it was a phenomenon which actually existed. Heraclitus of
Ephesus is an obvious instance. He deliberately expressed himself in
language which should not be understood of the vulgar, and which bore a
hidden meaning to his disciples. Pythagoras did the same. The prophets
and religious writers must have done so to an even greater
extent.<A NAME="an_fr_167_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_167_1">167_1</A> And we know enough of the history of ritual to be sure
that a great deal of it is definitely allegorical. The Hellenistic Age
did not wantonly invent the theory of allegory.</p>

<p>And secondly, we must remember what states of mind tend especially to
produce this kind of belief. They are not contemptible states of mind.
It needs only a strong idealism with which the facts of experience
clash, and allegory follows almost of necessity. The facts cannot be
accepted as they are. They must needs be explained as meaning something
different.</p>

<p>Take an earnest Stoic or Platonist, a man of fervid mind, who is
possessed by the ideals of his philosophy and at the same time feels his
heart thrilled by the beauty of the old poetry. What is he to do? On one
side he can find Zoilus, or Plato himself, or the Cynic preachers,
condemning Homer and the poets without remorse, as teachers of
foolishness. He can treat poetry as the English puritans treated the
stage. But is that a satisfactory solution? Remember that these
generations were trained habitually to give great weight to the voice of
their inner <a name="page_168"><font size="1" color="green">p. 168</font></A> consciousness, and the inner consciousness of a sensitive
man cries out that any such solution is false: that Homer is not a liar,
but noble and great, as our fathers have always taught us. On the other
side comes Heraclitus the allegorist. 'If Homer used no allegories he
committed all impieties.' On this theory the words can be allowed to
possess all their old beauty and magic, but an inner meaning is added
quite different from that which they bear on the surface. It may, very
likely, be a duller and less poetic meaning; but I am not sure that the
verses will not gain by the mere process of brooding study fully as much
as they lose by the ultimate badness of the interpretation. Anyhow, that
was the road followed. The men of whom I speak were not likely to give
up any experience that seemed to make the world more godlike or to feed
their spiritual and emotional cravings. They left that to the barefooted
cynics. They craved poetry and they craved philosophy; if the two spoke
like enemies, their words must needs be explained away by one who loved
both.</p>

<p>The same process was applied to the world itself. Something like it is
habitually applied by the religious idealists of all ages. A fundamental
doctrine of Stoicism and most of the idealist creeds was the perfection
and utter blessedness of the world, and the absolute fulfilment of the
purpose of God. Now obviously this belief was not based on experience.
The poor world, to do it justice amid all its misdoings, has never lent
itself to any such barefaced deception as that. No doubt it shrieked
against the doctrine then, as loud as it has always shrieked, so that
even a Posidonian or a Pythagorean, his ears straining for the music of
the spheres, was <a name="page_169"><font size="1" color="green">p. 169</font></A> sometimes forced to listen. And what was his answer?
It is repeated in all the literature of these sects. 'Our human
experience is so small: the things of the earth may be bad and more than
bad, but, ah! if you only went beyond the Moon! That is where the true
Kosmos begins.' And, of course, if we did ever go there, we all know
they would say it began beyond the Sun. Idealism of a certain type will
have its way; if hard life produces an ounce or a pound or a million
tons of fact in the scale against it, it merely dreams of infinite
millions in its own scale, and the enemy is outweighed and smothered. I
do not wish to mock at these Posidonian Stoics and Hermetics and
Gnostics and Neo-Pythagoreans. They loved goodness, and their faith is
strong and even terrible. One feels rather inclined to bow down before
their altars and cry: <i>Magna est Delusio et praevalebit.</i></p>

<p>Yet on the whole one rises from these books with the impression that all
this allegory and mysticism is bad for men. It may make the emotions
sensitive, it certainly weakens the understanding. And, of course, in
this paper I have left out of account many of the grosser forms of
superstition. In any consideration of the balance, they should not be
forgotten.</p>

<p>If a reader of Proclus and the <i>Corpus Hermeticum</i> wants relief, he will
find it, perhaps, best in the writings of a gentle old Epicurean who
lived at Oenoanda in Cappadocia about <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 200. His name was
Diogenes.<A NAME="an_fr_169_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_169_1">169_1</A> His works are preserved, in a fragmentary state, not on
papyrus or parchment, but on the wall of a large portico where he
engraved them for passers-by to read. He lived in a world of
<a name="page_170"><font size="1" color="green">p. 170</font></A> superstition and foolish terror, and he wrote up the great doctrines of
Epicurus for the saving of mankind.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Being brought by age to the sunset of my life, and expecting
at any moment to take my departure from the world with a glad
song for the fullness of my happiness, I have resolved, lest I
be taken too soon, to give help to those of good temperament.
If one person or two or three or four, or any small number you
choose, were in distress, and I were summoned out to help one
after another, I would do all in my power to give the best
counsel to each. But now, as I have said, the most of men lie
sick, as it were of a pestilence, in their false beliefs about
the world, and the tale of them increases; for by imitation
they take the disease from one another, like sheep. And
further it is only just to bring help to those who shall come
after us&mdash;for they too are ours, though they be yet unborn;
and love for man commands us also to help strangers who may
pass by. Since therefore the good message of the Book has this
wall and to set forth in public the medicine of the healing of
mankind.'</p></div>

<p>The people of his time and neighbourhood seem to have fancied that the
old man must have some bad motive. They understood mysteries and
redemptions and revelations. They understood magic and curses. But they
were puzzled, apparently, by this simple message, which only told them
to use their reason, their courage, and their sympathy, and not to be
afraid of death or of angry gods. The doctrine was condensed into four
sentences of a concentrated eloquence that make a translator
despair:<A NAME="an_fr_170_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fn_170_1">170_1</A> 'Nothing <a name="page_171"><font size="1" color="green">p. 171</font></A> to fear in God: Nothing to feel in Death: Good
can be attained: Evil can be endured.'</p>

<p>Of course, the doctrines of this good old man do not represent the whole
truth. To be guided by one's aversions is always a sign of weakness or
defeat; and it is as much a failure of nerve to reject blindly for fear
of being a fool, as to believe blindly for fear of missing some
emotional stimulus.</p>

<p>There is no royal road in these matters. I confess it seems strange to
me as I write here, to reflect that at this moment many of my friends
and most of my fellow creatures are, as far as one can judge, quite
confident that they possess supernatural knowledge. As a rule, each
individual belongs to some body which has received in writing the
results of a divine revelation. I cannot share in any such feeling. The
Uncharted surrounds us on every side and we must needs have some
relation towards it, a relation which will depend on the general
discipline of a man's mind and the bias of his whole character. As far
as knowledge and conscious reason will go, we should follow resolutely
their austere guidance. When they cease, as cease they must, we must use
as best we can those fainter powers of apprehension and surmise and
sensitiveness by which, after all, most high truth has been reached as
well as most high art and poetry: careful always really to seek for
truth and not for our own emotional satisfaction, careful not to neglect
the real needs of men and women through basing our life on dreams; and
remembering above all to walk gently in a world where the lights are dim
and the very stars wander.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Bibliographical Note</span></h4>

<p>It is not my purpose to make anything like a systematic bibliography,
but a few recommendations may be useful to some students who approach
this subject, as I have done, from the side of classical Greek.</p>

<p>For Greek Philosophy I have used besides Plato and Aristotle, Diogenes
Laertius and Philodemus, Diels, <i>Fragmente der Vorsokratiker</i>; Diels,
<i>Doxographi Graeci</i>; von Arnim, <i>Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta</i>; Usener,
<i>Epicurea</i>; also the old <i>Fragmenta Philosophorum</i> of Mullach.</p>

<p>For later Paganism and Gnosticism, Reitzenstein, <i>Poimandres</i>;
Reitzenstein, <i>Die hellenistischen Mysterienreligionen</i>; Dieterich,
<i>Eine Mithrasliturgic</i> (also <i>Abraxas</i>, <i>Nekyia</i>, <i>Muttererde</i>, &amp;c.); P.
Wendland, <i>Hellenistisch-R&ouml;mische Kultur</i>; Cumont, <i>Textes et Monuments
relatifs aux Myst&egrave;res de Mithra</i> (also <i>The Mysteries of Mithra</i>,
Chicago, 1903), and <i>Les Religions Orientales dans l'Empire Romain</i>;
Seeck, <i>Untergang der antiken Welt</i>, vol. iii; Philo, <i>de Vita
Contemplativa</i>, Conybeare; Gruppe, <i>Griechische Religion and
Mythologie</i>, pp. 1458-1676; Bousset, <i>Hauptprobleme der Gnosis</i>, 1907,
with good bibliography in the introduction; articles by E. Bevan in the
<i>Quarterly Review</i>, No. 424 (June 1910), and the <i>Hibbert Journal</i>, xi.
1 (October 1912). <i>Dokumente der Gnosis</i>, by W. Schultz (Jena, 1910),
gives a highly subjective translation and reconstruction of most of the
Gnostic documents: the <i>Corpus Hermeticum</i> is translated into English by
G. R. S. Meade, <i>Thrice Greatest Hermes</i>, 1906. The first volume of Dr.
Scott's monumental edition of the <i>Hermetica</i> (Clarendon Press, 1924)
has appeared just too late to be used in the present volume.</p>

<p>For Jewish thought before the Christian era Dr. Charles's <i>Testaments of
the Twelve Patriarchs</i>; also the same writer's <i>Book of Enoch</i>, and the
<i>Religionsgeschichtliche Erkl&auml;rung des Neuen Testaments</i> by Carl Clemen,
Giessen, 1909.</p>

<p>Of Christian writers apart from the New Testament those that come most
into account are Hippolytis (<ins class="explain" title="cross symbol">&#10013;</ins> <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 250), <i>Refutatio
Omnium Haeresium</i>, Epiphanius (367-403), <i>Panarion</i>, and Irenaeus
(<ins class="explain" title="cross symbol">&#10013;</ins> <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 202), <i>Contra Haereses</i>, i, ii. For a simple
introduction to the problems presented by the New Testament literature I
would venture to recommend Prof. Bacon's <i>New Testament</i>, in the Home
University Library, and Dr. Estlin Carpenter's <i>First Three Gospels</i>. In
such a vast literature I dare not make any further recommendations, but
for a general introduction to the History of Religions with a good and
brief bibliography I would refer the reader to Salomon Reinach's
<i>Orpheus</i> (Paris, 1909; English translation the same year), a book of
wide learning and vigorous thought.</p>

<h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><A NAME="an_fn_124_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr08.htm#an_fr_124_1">124_1</A> Mr. Marett has pointed out that this conception has its
roots deep in primitive human nature: <i>The Birth of Humility</i>, Oxford,
1910, p. 17. 'It would, perhaps, be fanciful to say that man tends to
run away from the sacred as uncanny, to cower before it as secret, and
to prostrate himself before it as tabu. On the other hand, it seems
plain that to these three negative qualities of the sacred taken
together there corresponds on the part of man a certain negative
attitude of mind. Psychologists class the feelings bound up with flight,
cowering, and prostration under the common head of "asthenic emotion".
In plain English they are all forms of heart-sinking, of feeling
unstrung. This general type of innate disposition would seem to be the
psychological basis of Humility. Taken in its social setting, the
emotion will, of course, show endless shades of complexity; for it will
be excited, and again will find practical expression, in all sorts of
ways. Under these varying conditions, however, it is reasonable to
suppose that what Mr. McDougall would call the "central part" of the
experience remains very much the same. In face of the sacred the normal
man is visited by a heart-sinking, a wave of asthenic emotion.' Mr.
Marett continues: 'If that were all, however, Religion would be a matter
of pure fear. But it is not all. There is yet the positive side of the
sacred to be taken into account.' It is worth remarking also that
Schleiermacher (1767-1834) placed the essence of religion in the feeling
of absolute dependence without attempting to define the object towards
which it was directed.</p></div>

text is perhaps the interesting fragment of Demetrius of Phalerum (fr.
19, in <i>F. H. G.</i> ii. 368), written about 317 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> It is quoted with
admiration by Polybius xxix. 21, with reference to the defeat of Perseus
of Macedon by the Romans:</p>

<p>'One must often remember the saying of Demetrius of Phalerum .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in his
Treatise on Fortune.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. "If you were to take not an indefinite time, nor
many generations, but just the fifty years before this, you could see in
them the violence of Fortune. Fifty years ago do you suppose that either
the Macedonians or the King of Macedon, or the Persians or the King of
Persia, if some God had foretold them what was to come, would ever have
believed that by the present time the Persians, who were then masters of
almost all the inhabited world, would have ceased to be even a
geographical name, while the Macedonians, who were then not even a name,
would be rulers of all? Yet this Fortune, who bears no relation to our
method of life, but transforms everything in the way we do not expect
and displays her power by surprises, is at the present moment showing
all the world that, when she puts the Macedonians into the rich
inheritance of the Persian, she has only lent them these good things
until she changes her mind about them." Which has now happened in the
case of Perseus. The words of Demetrius were a prophecy uttered, as it
were, by inspired lips.'</p></div>

of that God who is without shape or form, established above the
understanding and all the intelligible world. To whom I, Porphyry, being
now in my sixty-eighth year, profess that I once drew near and was made
one with him. At any rate he appeared to Plotinus "a goal close at
