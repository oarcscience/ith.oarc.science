<h2>I</h2>

<h3>SATURNIA REGNA</h3>

<p>Many persons who are quite prepared to admit the importance to the world
of Greek poetry, Greek art, and Greek philosophy, may still feel it
rather a paradox to be told that Greek religion specially repays our
study at the present day. Greek religion, associated with a romantic,
trivial, and not very edifying mythology, has generally seemed one of
the weakest spots in the armour of those giants of the old world. Yet I
will venture to make for Greek religion almost as great a claim as for
the thought and the literature, not only because the whole mass of it is
shot through by those strange lights of feeling and imagination, and the
details of it constantly wrought into beauty by that instinctive sense
of artistic form, which we specially associate with Classical Greece,
but also for two definite historical reasons. In the first place, the
student of that dark and fascinating department of the human mind which
we may call Religious Origins, will find in Greece an extraordinary mass
of material belonging to a very early date. For detail and variety the
primitive Greek evidence has no equal. And, secondly, in this department
as in others, ancient Greece has the triumphant if tragic distinction of
beginning at the very bottom and struggling, however precariously, to
the very summits. There is hardly any horror of primitive superstition
of which we cannot find some distant traces in our Greek record. <a name="page_2"><font size="1" color="green">p. 2</font></A> There
is hardly any height of spiritual thought attained in the world that has
not its archetype or its echo in the stretch of Greek literature that
lies between Thales and Plotinus, embracing much of the
'Wisdom-Teachers' and of St. Paul.</p>

<p>The progress of Greek religion falls naturally into three stages, all of
them historically important. First there is the primitive <i>Euetheia</i> or
Age of Ignorance, before Zeus came to trouble men's minds, a stage to
which our anthropologists and explorers have found parallels in every
part of the world. Dr. Preuss applies to it the charming word
'Urdummheit', or 'Primal Stupidity'. In some ways characteristically
Greek, in others it is so typical of similar stages of thought elsewhere
that one is tempted to regard it as the normal beginning of all
religion, or almost as the normal raw material out of which religion is
made. There is certainly some repulsiveness, but I confess that to me
there is also an element of fascination in the study of these 'Beastly
Devices of the Heathen', at any rate as they appear in early Greece,
where each single 'beastly device' as it passes is somehow touched with
beauty and transformed by some spirit of upward striving.</p>

<p>Secondly there is the Olympian or classical stage, a stage in which, for
good or ill, blunderingly or successfully, this primitive vagueness was
reduced to a kind of order. This is the stage of the great Olympian
gods, who dominated art and poetry, ruled the imagination of Rome, and
extended a kind of romantic dominion even over the Middle Ages. It is
the stage that we learn, or mis-learn, from the statues and the
handbooks of mythology. Critics have said that this <a name="page_3"><font size="1" color="green">p. 3</font></A> Olympian stage has
value only as art and not as religion. That is just one of the points
into which we shall inquire.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there is the Hellenistic period, reaching roughly from Plato to
St. Paul and the earlier Gnostics. The first edition of this book
treated the whole period as one, but I have now divided it by writing a
new chapter on the Movements of the Fourth Century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, and making
that my third stage. This was the time when the Greek mind, still in its
full creative vigour, made its first response to the twofold failure of
the world in which it had put its faith, the open bankruptcy of the
Olympian religion and the collapse of the city-state. Both had failed,
and each tried vainly to supply the place of the other. Greece responded
by the creation of two great permanent types of philosophy which have
influenced human ethics ever since, the Cynic and Stoic schools on the
one hand, and the Epicurean on the other. These schools belong properly,
I think, to the history of religion. The successors of Aristotle
produced rather a school of progressive science, those of Plato a school
of refined scepticism. The religious side of Plato's thought was not
revealed in its full power till the time of Plotinus in the third
century <span class="smcap">a. d.</span>; that of Aristotle, one might say without undue paradox,
not till its exposition by Aquinas in the thirteenth.</p>

<p>The old Third Stage, therefore, becomes now a Fourth, comprising the
later and more popular movements of the Hellenistic Age, a period based
on the consciousness of manifold failure, and consequently touched both
with morbidity and with that spiritual exaltation which is so often the
companion of morbidity. <a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="green">p. 4</font></A> It not only had behind it the failure of the
Olympian theology and of the free city-state, now crushed by
semi-barbarous military monarchies; it lived through the gradual
realization of two other failures&mdash;the failure of human government, even
when backed by the power of Rome or the wealth of Egypt, to achieve a
good life for man; and lastly the failure of the great propaganda of
Hellenism, in which the long-drawn effort of Greece to educate a corrupt
and barbaric world seemed only to lead to the corruption or
barbarization of the very ideals which it sought to spread. This sense
of failure, this progressive loss of hope in the world, in sober
calculation, and in organized human effort, threw the later Greek back
upon his own soul, upon the pursuit of personal holiness, upon emotions,
mysteries and revelations, upon the comparative neglect of this
transitory and imperfect world for the sake of some dream-world far off,
which shall subsist without sin or corruption, the same yesterday,
to-day, and for ever. These four are the really significant and
formative periods of Greek religious thought; but we may well cast our
eyes also on a fifth stage, not historically influential perhaps, but at
least romantic and interesting and worthy of considerable respect, when
the old religion in the time of Julian roused itself for a last
spiritual protest against the all-conquering 'atheism' of the
Christians. I omit Plotinus, as in earlier chapters I have omitted Plato
and Aristotle, and for the same reason. As a rule in the writings of
Julian's circle and still more in the remains of popular belief, the
tendencies of our fourth stage are accentuated by an increased demand
for definite dogma and a still deeper consciousness of worldly defeat.</p>

<p><a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="green">p. 5</font></A> </p><p>I shall not start with any definition of religion. Religion, like
poetry and most other living things, cannot be defined. But one may
perhaps give some description of it, or at least some characteristic
marks. In the first place, religion essentially deals with the uncharted
region of human experience. A large part of human life has been
thoroughly surveyed and explored; we understand the causes at work; and
we are not bewildered by the problems. That is the domain of positive
knowledge. But all round us on every side there is an uncharted region,
just fragments of the fringe of it explored, and those imperfectly; it
is with this that religion deals. And secondly we may note that religion
deals with its own province not tentatively, by the normal methods of
patient intellectual research, but directly, and by methods of emotion
or sub-conscious apprehension. Agriculture, for instance, used to be
entirely a question of religion; now it is almost entirely a question of
science. In antiquity, if a field was barren, the owner of it would
probably assume that the barrenness was due to 'pollution', or offence
somewhere. He would run through all his own possible offences, or at any
rate those of his neighbours and ancestors, and when he eventually
decided the cause of the trouble, the steps that he would take would all
be of a kind calculated not to affect the chemical constitution of the
soil, but to satisfy his own emotions of guilt and terror, or the
imaginary emotions of the imaginary being he had offended. A modern man
in the same predicament would probably not think of religion at all, at
any rate in the earlier stages; he would say it was a case for deeper
ploughing or for basic slag. Later on, <a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="green">p. 6</font></A> if disaster followed disaster
till he began to feel himself a marked man, even the average modern
would, I think, begin instinctively to reflect upon his sins. A third
characteristic flows from the first. The uncharted region surrounds us
on every side and is apparently infinite; consequently, when once the
things of the uncharted region are admitted as factors in our ordinary
conduct of life they are apt to be infinite factors, overruling and
swamping all others. The thing that religion forbids is a thing never to
be done; not all the inducements that this life can offer weigh at all
in the balance. Indeed there is no balance. The man who makes terms with
his conscience is essentially non-religious; the religious man knows
that it will profit him nothing if he gain all this finite world and
lose his stake in the infinite and eternal.<A NAME="an_fr_6_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_6_1">6_1</A></p>

<p><a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="green">p. 7</font></A> </p><p>Am I going to draw no distinction then between religion and mere
superstition? Not at present. Later on we may perhaps see some way to
it. Superstition is the name given to a low or bad form of religion, to
the kind of religion we disapprove. The line of division, if we made
one, would be only an arbitrary bar thrust across a highly complex and
continuous process.</p>

<p>Does this amount to an implication that all the religions that have
existed in the world are false? Not so. It is obvious indeed that most,
if analysed into intellectual beliefs, are false; and I suppose that a
thoroughly orthodox member of any one of the million religious bodies
that exist in the world must be clear in his mind that the other million
minus one are wrong, if not wickedly wrong. That, I think, we must be
clear about. Yet the fact remains that man must have some relation
towards the uncharted, the mysterious, tracts of life which surround him
on every side. And for my own part I am content to say that his method
must be to a large extent very much what St. Paul calls <ins class="greek" title="pistis">&#960;&#8055;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962;</ins> or
faith: that is, some attitude not of the conscious intellect but of the
whole being, using all its powers of sensitiveness, all its feeblest and
most inarticulate feelers and tentacles, in the effort <a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="green">p. 8</font></A> somehow to touch
by these that which cannot be grasped by the definite senses or analysed
by the conscious reason. What we gain thus is an insecure but a precious
possession. We gain no dogma, at least no safe dogma, but we gain much
more. We gain something hard to define, which lies at the heart not only
of religion, but of art and poetry and all the higher strivings of human
emotion. I believe that at times we actually gain practical guidance in
some questions where experience and argument fail.<A NAME="an_fr_8_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_8_1">8_1</A> That is a great
work left for religion, but we must always remember two things about it:
first, that the liability to error is enormous, indeed almost infinite;
and second, that the results of confident error are very terrible.
Probably throughout history the worst things ever done in the world on a
large scale by decent people have been done in the name of religion, and
I do not think that has entirely ceased to be true at the present day.
All the Middle Ages held the <a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="green">p. 9</font></A> strange and, to our judgement, the
obviously insane belief that the normal result of religious error was
eternal punishment. And yet by the crimes to which that false belief led
them they almost proved the truth of something very like it. The record
of early Christian and medieval persecutions which were the direct
result of that one confident religious error comes curiously near to
one's conception of the wickedness of the damned.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>To turn to our immediate subject, I wish to put forward here what is
still a rather new and unauthorized view of the development of Greek
religion; readers will forgive me if, in treating so vast a subject, I
draw my outline very broadly, leaving out many qualifications, and
quoting only a fragment of the evidence.</p>

<p>The things that have misled us moderns in our efforts towards
understanding the primitive stage in Greek religion have been first the
widespread and almost ineradicable error of treating Homer as primitive,
and more generally our unconscious insistence on starting with the
notion of 'Gods'. Mr. Hartland, in his address as president of one of
the sections of the International Congress of Religions at Oxford,<A NAME="an_fr_9_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_9_1">9_1</A>
dwelt on the significant fact about savage religions that wherever the
word 'God' is used our trustiest witnesses tend to contradict one
another. Among the best observers of the Arunta tribes, for instance,
some hold that they have no conception of God, others that they are
constantly thinking about God. The truth is that <a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="green">p. 10</font></A> this idea of a god far
away in the sky&mdash;I do not say merely a First Cause who is 'without body
parts or passions', but almost any being that we should naturally call a
'god'&mdash;is an idea not easy for primitive man to grasp. It is a subtle
and rarefied idea, saturated with ages of philosophy and speculation.
And we must always remember that one of the chief religions of the
world, Buddhism, has risen to great moral and intellectual heights
without using the conception of God at all; in his stead it has Dharma,
the Eternal Law.<A NAME="an_fr_10_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_10_1">10_1</A></p>

<p>Apart from some few philosophers, both Christian and Moslem, the gods of
the ordinary man have as a rule been as a matter of course
anthropomorphic. Men did not take the trouble to try to conceive them
otherwise. In many cases they have had the actual bodily shape of man;
in almost all they have possessed&mdash;of course in their highest
development&mdash;his mind and reason and his mental attributes. It causes
most of us even now something of a shock to be told by a medieval Arab
philosopher that to call God benevolent or righteous or to predicate of
him any other human quality is just as Pagan and degraded as to say that
he has a beard.<A NAME="an_fr_10_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_10_2">10_2</A> Now the Greek gods seem at first sight quite
particularly solid and anthropomorphic. The statues and vases speak
clearly, and they are mostly borne out by the literature. Of course we
must discount the kind of evidence that misled Winckelmann, the mere
Roman and Alexandrian art and mythology; but even if we go back <a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="green">p. 11</font></A> to the
fifth century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> we shall find the ruling conceptions far nobler
indeed, but still anthropomorphic. We find firmly established the
Olympian patriarchal family, Zeus the Father of gods and men, his wife
Hera, his son Apollo, his daughter Athena, his brothers Poseidon and
Hades, and the rest. We probably think of each figure more or less as
like a statue, a habit of mind obviously wrong and indeed absurd, as if
one thought of 'Labour' and 'Grief' as statues because Rodin or St.
Gaudens has so represented them. And yet it was a habit into which the
late Greeks themselves sometimes fell;<A NAME="an_fr_11_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_11_1">11_1</A> their arts of sculpture and
painting as applied to religion had been so dangerously successful: they
sharpened and made vivid an anthropomorphism which in its origin had
been mostly the result of normal human laziness. The process of making
winds and rivers into anthropomorphic gods is, for the most part, not
the result of using the imagination with special vigour. It is the
result of not doing so. The wind is obviously alive; any fool can see
that. Being alive, it blows; how? why, naturally; just as you and I
blow. It knocks things down, it shouts and dances, it whispers and
talks. And, unless we are going to make a great effort of the
imagination and try to realize, like a scientific man, just what really
happens, we naturally assume that it does these things in the normal
way, in the only way we know. Even when you worship a beast or a stone,
you practically anthropomorphize it. It happens indeed to have a
perfectly clear shape, so you accept that. But it talks, acts, and
fights just like a man&mdash;as <a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="green">p. 12</font></A> you can see from the <i>Australian Folk Tales</i>
published by Mrs. Langloh Parker&mdash;because you do not take the trouble to
think out any other way of behaving. This kind of anthropomorphism&mdash;or
as Mr. Gladstone used to call it, 'anthropophuism'&mdash;'humanity of
<i>nature</i>'&mdash;is primitive and inevitable: the sharp-cut statue type of god
is different, and is due in Greece directly to the work of the artists.</p>

<p>We must get back behind these gods of the artist's workshop and the
romance-maker's imagination, and see if the religious thinkers of the
great period use, or imply, the same highly human conceptions. We shall
find Parmenides telling us that God coincides with the universe, which
is a sphere and immovable;<A NAME="an_fr_12_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_12_1">12_1</A> Heraclitus, that God is 'day night,
summer winter, war peace, satiety hunger'. Xenophanes, that God is
all-seeing, all-hearing, and all mind;<A NAME="an_fr_12_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_12_2">12_2</A> and as for his supposed
human shape, why, if bulls and lions were to speak about God they would
doubtless tell us that he was a bull or a lion.<A NAME="an_fr_12_3"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_12_3">12_3</A> We must notice the
instinctive language of the poets, using the word <ins class="greek" title="theos">&#952;&#949;&#8057;&#962;</ins> in many subtle
senses for which our word 'God' is too stiff, too personal, and too
anthropomorphic. <ins class="greek" title="To eutychein">&#932;&#8057; &#949;&#8016;&#964;&#965;&#967;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</ins>, 'the fact of success', is 'a god and
more than a god'; <ins class="greek" title="to gign&ocirc;skein philous">&#964;&#8056; &#947;&#953;&#947;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#966;&#8055;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#962;</ins>, 'the thrill of recognizing a
friend' after long absence, is a 'god'; wine is a 'god' whose body is
poured out in libation to gods; and in the unwritten law of the human
conscience 'a great god liveth and groweth not old'.<A NAME="an_fr_12_4"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_12_4">12_4</A> You will <a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="green">p. 13</font></A> say
that is mere poetry or philosophy: it represents a particular theory or
a particular metaphor. I think not. Language of this sort is used widely
and without any explanation or apology. It was evidently understood and
felt to be natural by the audience. If it is metaphorical, all metaphors
have grown from the soil of current thought and normal experience. And
without going into the point at length I think we may safely conclude
that the soil from which such language as this grew was not any system
of clear-cut personal anthropomorphic theology. No doubt any of these
poets, if he had to make a picture of one of these utterly formless
Gods, would have given him a human form. That was the recognized symbol,
as a veiled woman is St. Gaudens's symbol for 'Grief'.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>But we have other evidence too which shows abundantly that these
Olympian gods are not primary, but are imposed upon a background
strangely unlike themselves. For a long time their luminous figures
dazzled our eyes; we were not able to see the half-lit regions behind
them, the dark primeval tangle of desires and fears and dreams from
which they drew their vitality. The surest test to apply in this
question is the evidence of actual cult. Miss Harrison has <a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="green">p. 14</font></A> here shown
us the right method, and following her we will begin with the three
great festivals of Athens, the Diasia, the Thesmophoria, and the
Anthesteria.<A NAME="an_fr_14_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_14_1">14_1</A></p>

<p>The Diasia was said to be the chief festival of Zeus, the central figure
of the Olympians, though our authorities generally add an epithet to
him, and call him Zeus Meilichios, Zeus of Placation. A god with an
'epithet' is always suspicious, like a human being with an 'alias'. Miss
Harrison's examination (<i>Prolegomena</i>, pp. 28 ff.) shows that in the
rites Zeus has no place at all. Meilichios from the beginning has a
fairly secure one. On some of the reliefs Meilichios appears not as a
god, but as an enormous bearded snake, a well-known representation of
underworld powers or dead ancestors. Sometimes the great snake is alone;
sometimes he rises gigantic above the small human worshippers
approaching him. And then, in certain reliefs, his old barbaric presence
vanishes, and we have instead a benevolent and human father of gods and
men, trying, as Miss Harrison somewhere expresses it, to look as if he
had been there all the time.</p>

<p>There was a sacrifice at the Diasia, but it was not a sacrifice given to
Zeus. To Zeus and all the heavenly gods men gave sacrifice in the form
of a feast, in which the god had his portion and the worshippers theirs.
The two parties cemented their friendship and feasted happily together.
But the sacrifice at the Diasia was a holocaust:<A NAME="an_fr_14_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_14_2">14_2</A> every shred of
the victim was burnt to ashes, that no man might partake of it. We know
<a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="green">p. 15</font></A> quite well the meaning of that form of sacrifice: it is a sacrifice to
placate or appease the powers below, the Chthonioi, the dead and the
lords of death. It was performed, as our authorities tell us, <ins class="greek" title="meta
stygnot&ecirc;tos">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#8048; &#963;&#964;&#965;&#947;&#957;&#8057;&#964;&#951;&#964;&#959;&#962;</ins>, with shuddering or repulsion.<A NAME="an_fr_15_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_15_1">15_1</A></p>

<p>The Diasia was a ritual of placation, that is, of casting away various
elements of pollution or danger and appeasing the unknown wraths of the
surrounding darkness. The nearest approach to a god contained in this
festival is Meilichios, and Meilichios, as we shall see later, belongs
to a particular class of shadowy beings who are built up out of ritual
services. His name means '<i>He of appeasement</i>', and he is nothing else.
He is merely the personified shadow or dream generated by the emotion of
the ritual&mdash;very much, to take a familiar instance, as Father Christmas
is a 'projection' of our Christmas customs.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The Thesmophoria formed the great festival of Demeter and her daughter
Kor&ecirc;, though here again Demeter appears with a clinging epithet,
Thesmophoros. We know pretty clearly the whole course of the ritual:
there is the carrying by women of certain magic charms, fir-cones and
snakes and unnameable objects made of paste, to ensure fertility; there
is a sacrifice of pigs, who were thrown into a deep cleft of the earth,
and their remains afterwards collected and scattered as a charm over the
fields. There is more magic ritual, more carrying of sacred objects, a
fast followed by a rejoicing, a disappearance of life below the earth,
and a rising again of life above it; but it is hard to find definite
traces of any personal <a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="green">p. 16</font></A> goddess. The Olympian Demeter and Persephone
dwindle away as we look closer, and we are left with the shadow
Thesmophoros, '<i>She who carries Thesmoi</i>',<A NAME="an_fr_16_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_16_1">16_1</A> not a substantive
personal goddess, but merely a personification of the ritual itself: an
imaginary Charm-bearer generated by so much charm-bearing, just as
Meilichios in the Diasia was generated from the ritual of appeasement.</p>

<p>Now the Diasia were dominated by a sacred snake. Is there any similar
divine animal in the Thesmophoria? Alas, yes. Both here, and still more
markedly in the mysteries of Demeter and Persephone at Eleusis, we
regularly find the most lovely of all goddesses, Demeter and Persephone,
habitually&mdash;I will not say represented by, but dangerously associated
with, a sacred Sow. A Pig is the one animal in Greek religion that
actually had sacrifice made to it.<A NAME="an_fr_16_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_16_2">16_2</A></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The third feast, the Anthesteria, belongs in classical times to the
Olympian Dionysus, and is said to be the oldest of his feasts. On the
surface there is a touch of the wine-god, and he is given due official
prominence; but as soon as we penetrate anywhere near the heart of <a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="green">p. 17</font></A> the
festival, Dionysus and his brother gods are quite forgotten, and all
that remains is a great ritual for appeasing the dead. All the days of
the Feast were <i>nefasti</i>, of ill omen; the first day especially was <ins class="greek" title="es
to pan apophras">&#7952;&#962; &#964;&#8056; &#960;&#8118;&#957; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#966;&#961;&#8049;&#962;</ins>. On it the Wine Jars which were also Seed and Funeral
Jars were opened and the spirits of the Dead let loose in the
world.<A NAME="an_fr_17_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_17_1">17_1</A> Nameless and innumerable, the ghosts are summoned out of
their tombs, and are duly feasted, each man summoning his own ghosts to
his own house, and carefully abstaining from any act that would affect
his neighbours. And then, when they are properly appeased and made
gentle, they are swept back again out of this world to the place where
they properly belong, and the streets and houses cleaned from the
presence of death. There is one central stage indeed in which Dionysus
does seem to appear. And he appears in a very significant way, to
conduct a Sacred Marriage. For, why do you suppose the dead are summoned
at all? What use to the tribe is the presence of all these dead
ancestors? They have come, I suspect, to be born again, to begin a new
life at the great Spring festival. For the new births of the tribe, the
new crops, the new kids, the new human beings, are of course really only
the old ones returned to earth.<A NAME="an_fr_17_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_17_2">17_2</A> The important thing is to get them
properly placated and purified, free from the contagion of ancient sin
or underworld anger. For nothing is so dangerous as the presence of what
I may call raw ghosts. The Anthesteria <a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="green">p. 18</font></A> contained, like other feasts of
the kind, a <ins class="greek" title="hieros gamos">&#7985;&#949;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#947;&#8049;&#956;&#959;&#962;</ins>, or Holy Marriage, between the wife of the
Basileus or Sacred King, and the imaginary god.<A NAME="an_fr_18_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_18_1">18_1</A> Whatever reality
there ever was in the ceremony has apparently by classical times faded
away. But the place where the god received his bride is curious. It was
called the Boukolion, or Bull's Shed. It was not originally the home of
an anthropomorphic god, but of a divine animal.</p>

<p>Thus in each of these great festivals we find that the Olympian gods
vanish away, and we are left with three things only: first, with an
atmosphere of religious dread; second, with a whole sequence of magical
ceremonies which, in two at least of the three cases,<A NAME="an_fr_18_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_18_2">18_2</A> produce a
kind of strange personal emanation of <a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="green">p. 19</font></A> themselves, the Appeasements
producing Meilichios, the Charm-bearings Thesmophoros; and thirdly, with
a divine or sacred animal. In the Diasia we find the old superhuman
snake, who reappears so ubiquitously throughout Greece, the regular
symbol of the underworld powers, especially the hero or dead ancestor.
Why the snake was so chosen we can only surmise. He obviously lived
underground: his home was among the Chthonioi, the Earth-People. Also,
says the Scholiast to Aristophanes (<i>Plut.</i> 533), he was a type of new
birth because he throws off his old skin and renews himself. And if that
in itself is not enough to show his supernatural power, what normal
earthly being could send his enemies to death by one little pin-prick,
as some snakes can?</p>

<p>In the Thesmophoria we found sacred swine, and the reason given by the
ancients is no doubt the right one. The sow is sacred because of its
fertility, and possibly as practical people we should add, because of
its cheapness. Swine are always prominent in Greek agricultural rites.
And the bull? Well, we modern town-dwellers have almost forgotten what a
real bull is like. For so many centuries we have tamed him and penned
him in, and utterly deposed him from his place as lord of the forest.
The bull was the chief of magic or sacred animals in Greece, chief
because of his enormous strength, his size, his rage, in fine, as
anthropologists call it, his <i>mana</i>; that primitive word which comprises
force, vitality, prestige, holiness, and power of magic, and which may
belong equally to a lion, a chief, a medicine-man, or a battle-axe.</p>

<p>Now in the art and the handbooks these sacred <a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="green">p. 20</font></A> animals have all been
adopted into the Olympian system. They appear regularly as the
'attributes' of particular gods. Zeus is merely accompanied by a snake,
an eagle, a bull, or at worst assumes for his private purposes the forms
of those animals. The cow and the cuckoo are sacred to Hera; the owl and
the snake to Athena; the dolphin, the crow, the lizard, the bull, to
Apollo. Dionysus, always like a wilder and less middle-aged Zeus,
appears freely as a snake, bull, he-goat, and lion. Allowing for some
isolated exceptions, the safest rule in all these cases is that the
attribute is original and the god is added.<A NAME="an_fr_20_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_20_1">20_1</A> It comes out very
clearly in the case of the snake and the bull. The tremendous <i>mana</i> of
the wild bull indeed occupies almost half the stage of pre-Olympian
ritual. The religion unearthed by Dr. Evans in Crete is permeated by the
bull of Minos. The heads and horns are in almost every sacred room and
on every altar. The great religious scene depicted on the sarcophagus of
Hagia Triada<A NAME="an_fr_20_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_20_2">20_2</A> centres in the holy blood that flows from the neck of
a captive and dying bull. Down into classical times bull's blood was a
sacred thing which it was dangerous to touch and death to taste: to
drink a cup of it was the most heroic form of suicide.<A NAME="an_fr_20_3"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_20_3">20_3</A> The
sacrificial bull at Delphi was called <i>Hosi&ocirc;t&ecirc;r</i>: he was not merely
<i>hosios</i>, holy; he <a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="green">p. 21</font></A> was <i>Hosi&ocirc;t&ecirc;r</i>, the Sanctifier, He who maketh Holy.
It was by contact with him that holiness was spread to others. On a coin
and a vase, cited by Miss Harrison,<A NAME="an_fr_21_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_21_1">21_1</A> we have a bull entering a holy
cave and a bull standing in a shrine. We have holy pillars whose
holiness consists in the fact that they have been touched with the blood
of a bull. We have a long record of a bull-ritual at Magnesia,<A NAME="an_fr_21_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_21_2">21_2</A> in
which Zeus, though he makes a kind of external claim to be lord of the
feast, dare not claim that the bull is sacrificed to him. Zeus has a ram
to himself and stands apart, showing but a weak and shadowy figure
beside the original Holy One. We have immense masses of evidence about
the religion of Mithras, at one time the most serious rival of
Christianity, which sought its hope and its salvation in the blood of a
divine bull.</p>

<p>Now what is the origin of this conception of the sacred animal? It was
first discovered and explained with almost prophetic insight by Dr.
Robertson Smith.<A NAME="an_fr_21_3"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_21_3">21_3</A> The origin is what he calls a sacramental feast:
you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the divine animal in
order&mdash;here I diverge from Robertson Smith's language&mdash;to get into you
his <i>mana</i>, his vital power. The classical instance is the sacramental
eating of a camel by an Arab tribe, recorded in the works of St.
Nilus.<A NAME="an_fr_21_4"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_21_4">21_4</A> The camel was devoured on a particular day at the rising of
the morning star. He was cut to pieces alive, and every fragment of him
had <a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="green">p. 22</font></A> to be consumed before the sun rose. If the life had once gone out
of the flesh and blood the sacrifice would have been spoilt; it was the
spirit, the vitality, of the camel that his tribesmen wanted. The only
serious error that later students have found in Robertson Smith's
statement is that he spoke too definitely of the sacrifice as affording
communion with the tribal god. There was no god there, only the raw
material out of which gods are made. You devoured the holy animal to get
its <i>mana</i>, its swiftness, its strength, its great endurance, just as
the savage now will eat his enemy's brain or heart or hands to get some
particular quality residing there. The imagination of the pre-Hellenic
tribes was evidently dominated above all things by the bull, though
there were other sacramental feasts too, combined with sundry horrible
rendings and drinkings of raw blood. It is strange to think that even
small things like kids and fawns and hares should have struck primitive
man as having some uncanny vitality which he longed for, or at least
some uncanny power over the weather or the crops. Yet to him it no doubt
appeared obvious. Frogs, for instance, could always bring rain by
croaking for it, and who can limit the powers and the knowledge of
birds?<A NAME="an_fr_22_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_22_1">22_1</A></p>

<p>Here comes a difficulty. If the Olympian god was not there to start
with, how did he originate? We can understand&mdash;at least after a course
of anthropology&mdash;this desire of primitive man to acquire for himself the
superhuman forces of the bull; but how does he make the transition from
the real animal to the imaginary <a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="green">p. 23</font></A> human god? First let us remember the
innate tendency of primitive man everywhere, and not especially in
Greece, to imagine a personal cause, like himself in all points not
otherwise specified, for every striking phenomenon. If the wind blows it
is because some being more or less human, though of course superhuman,
is blowing with his cheeks. If a tree is struck by lightning it is
because some one has thrown his battle-axe at it. In some Australian
tribes there is no belief in natural death. If a man dies it is because
'bad man kill that fellow'. St. Paul, we may remember, passionately
summoned the heathen to refrain from worshipping <ins class="greek" title="t&ecirc;n ktisin">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#954;&#964;&#8055;&#963;&#953;&#957;</ins>, the
creation, and go back to <ins class="greek" title="ton ktisanta">&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#954;&#964;&#8055;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#945;</ins>, the creator, human and
masculine. It was as a rule a road that they were only too ready to
travel.<A NAME="an_fr_23_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_23_1">23_1</A></p>

<p>But this tendency was helped by a second factor. Research has shown us
the existence in early Mediterranean religion of a peculiar transitional
step, a man wearing the head or skin of a holy beast. The Egyptian gods
are depicted as men with beasts' heads: that is, the best authorities
tell us, their shapes are derived from the kings and priests who on
great occasions of sacrifice covered their heads with a
beast-mask.<A NAME="an_fr_23_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_23_2">23_2</A> Minos, with his projection the Minotaur, was a
bull-god and wore a bull-mask. From early Island gems, from a fresco at
Mycenae, from Assyrian reliefs, Mr. A. B. Cook has collected many
examples of this mixed figure&mdash;a man wearing the <i>protom&ecirc;</i>, or mask and
mane, of a beast. Sometimes we can actually see him <a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="green">p. 24</font></A> offering libations.
Sometimes the worshipper has become so closely identified with his
divine beast that he is represented not as a mere man wearing the
<i>protom&ecirc;</i> of a lion or bull, but actually as a lion or bull wearing the
<i>protom&ecirc;</i> of another.<A NAME="an_fr_24_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_24_1">24_1</A> Hera, <ins class="greek" title="bo&ocirc;pis">&#946;&#959;&#8182;&#960;&#953;&#962;</ins>, with a cow's head; Athena,
<ins class="greek" title="glauk&ocirc;pis">&#947;&#955;&#945;&#965;&#954;&#8182;&#960;&#953;&#962;</ins>, with an owl's head, or bearing on her breast the head of
the Gorgon; Heracles clad in a lion's skin and covering his brow <ins class="greek" title="dein&ocirc;
chasmati th&ecirc;ros">&#948;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#8183; &#967;&#8049;&#963;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953; &#952;&#951;&#961;&#8057;&#962;</ins>, 'with the awful spread jaws of the wild beast', belong
to the same class. So does the Dadouchos at Eleusis and other initiators
who let candidates for purification set one foot&mdash;one only and that the
left&mdash;on the skin of a sacrificial ram, and called the skin <ins class="greek" title="Dios k&ocirc;as">&#916;&#953;&#8056;&#962; &#954;&#8182;&#945;&#962;</ins>,
the fleece not of a ram, but of Zeus.<A NAME="an_fr_24_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_24_2">24_2</A></p>

<p>The <i>mana</i> of the slain beast is in the hide and head and blood and fur,
and the man who wants to be in thorough contact with the divinity gets
inside the skin and wraps himself deep in it. He begins by being a man
wearing a lion's skin: he ends, as we have seen, by feeling himself to
be a lion wearing a lion's skin. And who is this man? He may on
particular occasions be only a candidate for purification or initiation.
But <i>par excellence</i> he who has the right is the priest, the
medicine-man, the divine king. If an old suggestion of my own is right,
he is the original <ins class="greek" title="theos">&#952;&#949;&#8057;&#962;</ins> or <ins class="greek" title="thesos">&#952;&#949;&#963;&#8057;&#962;</ins>, the incarnate medicine or spell
or magic power.<A NAME="an_fr_24_3"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_24_3">24_3</A> He at <a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="green">p. 25</font></A> first, I suspect, is the only <ins class="greek" title="theos">&#952;&#949;&#8057;&#962;</ins> or
'God' that his society knows. We commonly speak of ancient kings being
'deified'; we regard the process as due to an outburst of superstition
or insane flattery. And so no doubt it sometimes was, especially in
later times&mdash;when man and god were felt as two utterly distinct things.
But 'deification' is an unintelligent and misleading word. What we call
'deification' is only the survival of this undifferentiated human
<ins class="greek" title="theos">&#952;&#949;&#8057;&#962;</ins>, with his <i>mana</i>, his <ins class="greek" title="kratos">&#954;&#961;&#8049;&#964;&#959;&#962;</ins> and <ins class="greek" title="bia">&#946;&#8055;&#945;</ins>, his control of the
weather, the rain and the thunder, the spring crops and the autumn
floods; his knowledge of what was lawful and what was not, and his
innate power to curse or to 'make dead'. Recent researches have shown us
in abundance the early Greek medicine-chiefs making thunder and
lightning and rain.<A NAME="an_fr_25_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_25_1">25_1</A> We have long known the king as possessor of
Dike and Themis, of justice and tribal custom; we have known his effect
on the fertility of the fields and the tribes, and the terrible results
of a king's sin or a king's sickness.<A NAME="an_fr_25_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_25_2">25_2</A></p>

<p>What is the subsequent history of this medicine-chief or <ins class="greek" title="theos">&#952;&#949;&#8057;&#962;</ins>? He is
differentiated, as it were: the visible part of him becomes merely
human; the supposed supernatural part grows into what we should call a
God. The process is simple. Any particular <a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="green">p. 26</font></A> medicine-man is bound to
have his failures. As Dr. Frazer gently reminds us, every single
pretension which he puts forth on every day of his life is a lie, and
liable sooner or later to be found out. Doubtless men are tender to
their own delusions. They do not at once condemn the medicine-chief as a
fraudulent institution, but they tend gradually to say that he is not
the real all-powerful <ins class="greek" title="theos">&#952;&#949;&#8057;&#962;</ins>. He is only his representative. The real
<ins class="greek" title="theos">&#952;&#949;&#8057;&#962;</ins>, tremendous, infallible, is somewhere far away, hidden in clouds
perhaps, on the summit of some inaccessible mountain. If the mountain is
once climbed the god will move to the upper sky. The medicine-chief
meanwhile stays on earth, still influential. He has some connexion with
the great god more intimate than that of other men; at worst he
possesses the god's sacred instruments, his <ins class="greek" title="hiera">&#7985;&#949;&#961;&#8049;</ins> or <ins class="greek" title="orgia">&#8004;&#961;&#947;&#953;&#945;</ins>; he knows
the rules for approaching him and making prayers to him.</p>

<p>There is therefore a path open from the divine beast to the
anthropomorphic god. From beings like Thesmophoros and Meilichios the
road is of course much easier. They are already more than half
anthropomorphic; they only lack the concreteness, the lucid shape and
the detailed personal history of the Olympians. In this connexion we
must not forget the power of hallucination, still fairly strong, as the
history of religious revivals in America will bear witness,<A NAME="an_fr_26_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_26_1">26_1</A> but
far stronger, of course, among the impressionable hordes of early men.
'The god', says M. Doutt&eacute; in his profound study of Algerian magic,
'c'est le d&eacute;sir collectif personnifi&eacute;', the collective desire projected,
<a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="green">p. 27</font></A> as it were, or personified.<A NAME="an_fr_27_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_27_1">27_1</A> Think of the gods who have appeared
in great crises of battle, created sometimes by the desperate desire of
men who have for years prayed to them, and who are now at the last
extremity for lack of their aid, sometimes by the confused and excited
remembrances of the survivors after the victory. The gods who led the
Roman charge at Lake Regillus,<A NAME="an_fr_27_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_27_2">27_2</A> the gigantic figures that were seen
fighting before the Greeks at Marathon,<A NAME="an_fr_27_3"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_27_3">27_3</A> even the celestial signs
that promised Constantine victory for the cross:<A NAME="an_fr_27_4"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_27_4">27_4</A>&mdash;these are the
effects of great emotion: we can all understand them. But even in daily
life primitive men seem to have dealt more freely than we generally do
with apparitions and voices and daemons of every kind. One of the most
remarkable and noteworthy sources for this kind of hallucinatory god in
early societies is a social custom that we have almost forgotten, the
religious Dance. When the initiated young men of Crete or elsewhere
danced at night over the mountains in the Oreibasia or Mountain Walk
they not only did things that seemed beyond their ordinary workaday
strength; they also felt themselves led on and on by some power which
guided and sustained them. This daemon has no necessary name: a man may
be named after him 'Oreibasius', 'Belonging to the Mountain Dancer',
just as others may be named 'Apollonius' or 'Dionysius'. The god is only
the spirit of the Mountain <a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="green">p. 28</font></A> Dance, Oreibates, though of course he is
absorbed at different times in various Olympians. There is one god
called Aphiktor, the Suppliant, He who prays for mercy. He is just the
projection, as M. Doutt&eacute; would say, of the intense emotion of one of
those strange processions well known in the ancient world, bands of
despairing men or women who have thrown away all means of self-defence
and join together at some holy place in one passionate prayer for pity.
The highest of all gods, Zeus, was the special patron of the suppliant;
and it is strange and instructive to find that Zeus the all-powerful is
actually identified with this Aphiktor: <ins class="greek" title="Zeus men 'Aphikt&ocirc;r epidoi
prophron&ocirc;s">&#918;&#949;&#8058;&#962; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#7944;&#966;&#8055;&#954;&#964;&#969;&#961; &#7952;&#960;&#8055;&#948;&#959;&#953; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#969;&#962;</ins>.<A NAME="an_fr_28_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_28_1">28_1</A> The assembled prayer, the united cry that rises from
the oppressed of the world, is itself grown to be a god, and the
greatest god. A similar projection arose from the dance of the <i>Kouroi</i>,
or initiate youths, in the dithyramb&mdash;the magic dance which was to
celebrate, or more properly, to hasten and strengthen, the coming on of
spring. That dance projected the Megistos Kouros, the greatest of
youths, who is the incarnation of spring or the return of life, and lies
at the back of so many of the most gracious shapes of the classical
pantheon. The Kouros appears as Dionysus, as Apollo, as Hermes, as Ares:
in our clearest and most detailed piece of evidence he actually appears
with the characteristic history and attributes of Zeus.<A NAME="an_fr_28_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_28_2">28_2</A></p>

<p>This spirit of the dance, who leads it or personifies its emotion,
stands more clearly perhaps than any <a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="green">p. 29</font></A> other daemon half-way between
earth and heaven. A number of difficult passages in Euripides' <i>Bacchae</i>
and other Dionysiac literature find their explanations when we realize
how the god is in part merely identified with the inspired chief dancer,
in part he is the intangible projected incarnation of the emotion of the
dance.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>'The collective desire personified': on what does the collective desire,
or collective dread, of the primitive community chiefly concentrate? On
two things, the food-supply and the tribe-supply, the desire not to die
of famine and not to be harried or conquered by the neighbouring tribe.
The fertility of the earth and the fertility of the tribe, these two are
felt in early religion as one.<A NAME="an_fr_29_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_29_1">29_1</A> The earth is a mother: the human
mother is an <ins class="greek" title="aroura">&#7940;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#945;</ins>, or ploughed field. This earth-mother is the
characteristic and central feature of the early Aegean religions. The
introduction of agriculture made her a mother of fruits and corn, and it
is in that form that we best know her. But in earlier days she had been
a mother of the spontaneous growth of the soil, of wild beasts and trees
and all the life of the mountain.<A NAME="an_fr_29_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_29_2">29_2</A> In early Crete she stands with
lions erect on either side of her or with snakes held in her hands and
coiled about her body. And as the earth is mother <a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="green">p. 30</font></A> when the harvest
comes, so in spring she is maiden or Kor&ecirc;, but a maiden fated each year
to be wedded and made fruitful; and earlier still there has been the
terrible time when fields are bare and lifeless. The Kor&ecirc; has been
snatched away underground, among the dead peoples, and men must wait
expectant till the first buds begin to show and they call her to rise
again with the flowers. Meantime earth as she brings forth vegetation in
spring is Kourotrophos, rearer of Kouroi, or the young men of the tribe.
The nymphs and rivers are all Kourotrophoi. The Moon is Kourotrophos.
She quickens the young of the tribe in their mother's womb; at one
terrible hour especially she is 'a lion to women' who have offended
against her holiness. She also marks the seasons of sowing and
ploughing, and the due time for the ripening of crops. When men learn to
calculate in longer units, the Sun appears: they turn to the Sun for
their calendar, and at all times of course the Sun has been a power in
agriculture. He is not called Kourotrophos, but the Young Sun returning
after winter is himself a Kouros,<A NAME="an_fr_30_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_30_1">30_1</A> and all the Kouroi have some
touch of the Sun in them. The Cretan Spring-song of the Kouretes prays
for <ins class="greek" title="neoi politai">&#957;&#8051;&#959;&#953; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#8150;&#964;&#945;&#953;</ins>, young citizens, quite simply among the other gifts
of the spring.<A NAME="an_fr_30_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_30_2">30_2</A></p>

<p>This is best shown by the rites of tribal initiation, which seem
normally to have formed part of the spring <a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="green">p. 31</font></A> Dr&ocirc;mena or sacred
performances. The Kouroi, as we have said, are the initiated young men.
They pass through their initiation; they become no longer <ins class="greek" title="paides">&#960;&#945;&#8150;&#948;&#949;&#962;</ins>,
boys, but <ins class="greek" title="andres">&#7940;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#949;&#962;</ins>, men. The actual name Kouros is possibly connected
with <ins class="greek" title="keirein">&#954;&#949;&#8055;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#957;</ins>, to shave,<A NAME="an_fr_31_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_31_1">31_1</A> and may mean that after this ceremony
they first cut their long hair. Till then the <ins class="greek" title="kouros">&#954;&#959;&#8166;&#961;&#959;&#962;</ins> is
<ins class="greek" title="akersekom&ecirc;s">&#7936;&#954;&#949;&#961;&#963;&#949;&#954;&#8057;&#956;&#951;&#962;</ins>&mdash;with hair unshorn. They have now open to them the two
roads that belong to <ins class="greek" title="andres">&#7940;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#949;&#962;</ins> alone: they have the work of begetting
children for the tribe, and the work of killing the tribe's enemies in
battle.</p>

<p>The classification of people according to their age is apt to be sharp
and vivid in primitive communities. We, for example, think of an old man
as a kind of man, and an old woman as a kind of woman; but in primitive
peoples as soon as a man and woman cease to be able to perform his and
her due tribal functions they cease to be men and women, <ins class="greek" title="andres">&#7940;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#949;&#962;</ins> and
<ins class="greek" title="gynaikes">&#947;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#8150;&#954;&#949;&#962;</ins>: the ex-man becomes a <ins class="greek" title="ger&ocirc;n">&#947;&#8051;&#961;&#969;&#957;</ins>; the ex-woman a <ins class="greek" title="graus">&#947;&#961;&#945;&#8166;&#962;</ins>.<A NAME="an_fr_31_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_31_2">31_2</A>
We distinguish between 'boy' and 'man', between 'girl' and 'woman'; but
apart from the various words for baby, Attic Greek would have four sharp
divisions, <ins class="greek" title="pais">&#960;&#945;&#8150;&#962;</ins>, <ins class="greek" title="eph&ecirc;bos">&#7956;&#966;&#951;&#946;&#959;&#962;</ins>, <ins class="greek" title="an&ecirc;r">&#7936;&#957;&#8053;&#961;</ins>, <ins class="greek" title="ger&ocirc;n">&#947;&#8051;&#961;&#969;&#957;</ins>.<A NAME="an_fr_31_3"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_31_3">31_3</A> In Sparta the <a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="green">p. 32</font></A> divisions
are still sharper and more numerous, centring in the great initiation
ceremonies of the Iranes, or full-grown youths, to the goddess called
Orthia or Bortheia.<A NAME="an_fr_32_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_32_1">32_1</A> These initiation ceremonies are called
Teletai, 'completions': they mark the great 'rite of transition' from
the immature, charming, but half useless thing which we call boy or
girl, to the <ins class="greek" title="teleios an&ecirc;r">&#964;&#8051;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#8053;&#961;</ins>, the full member of the tribe as fighter or
counsellor, or to the <ins class="greek" title="teleia gyn&ecirc;">&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#8055;&#945; &#947;&#965;&#957;&#8053;</ins>, the full wife and mother. This
whole subject of Greek initiation ceremonies calls pressingly for more
investigation. It is only in the last few years that we have obtained
the material for understanding them, and the whole mass of the evidence
needs re-treatment. For one instance, it is clear that a great number of
rites which were formerly explained as remnants of human sacrifice are
simply ceremonies of initiation.<A NAME="an_fr_32_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_32_2">32_2</A></p>

<p>At the great spring Dr&ocirc;menon the tribe and the growing earth were
renovated together: the earth arises afresh from her dead seeds, the
tribe from its dead ancestors; and the whole process, charged as it is
with the emotion of pressing human desire, projects its anthropomorphic
god or daemon. A vegetation-spirit we call him, very inadequately; he is
a divine Kouros, a Year-Daemon, a spirit that in the first stage is
living, <a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="green">p. 33</font></A> then dies with each year, then thirdly rises again from the
dead, raising the whole dead world with him&mdash;the Greeks called him in
this phase 'the Third One', or the 'Saviour'. The renovation ceremonies
were accompanied by a casting off of the old year, the old garments, and
everything that is polluted by the infection of death. And not only of
death; but clearly I think, in spite of the protests of some Hellenists,
of guilt or sin also. For the life of the Year-Daemon, as it seems to be
reflected in Tragedy, is generally a story of Pride and Punishment. Each
Year arrives, waxes great, commits the sin of Hubris, and then is slain.
The death is deserved; but the slaying is a sin: hence comes the next
Year as Avenger, or as the Wronged One re-risen. 'All things pay
retribution for their injustice one to another according to the
ordinance of time.'<A NAME="an_fr_33_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_33_1">33_1</A> It is this range of ideas, half suppressed
during the classical period, but evidently still current among the ruder
and less Hellenized peoples, which supplied St. Paul with some of his
most famous and deep-reaching metaphors. 'Thou fool, that which thou
sowest is not quickened except it die.'<A NAME="an_fr_33_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_33_2">33_2</A> 'As He was raised from the
dead we may walk with Him in newness of life.' And this renovation must
be preceded by a casting out and killing of the old polluted life&mdash;'the
old man in us must first be crucified'.</p>

<p>'The old man must be crucified.' We observed that in all the three
Festivals there was a pervasive <a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="green">p. 34</font></A> element of vague fear. Hitherto we have
been dealing with early Greek religion chiefly from the point of view of
<i>mana</i>, the positive power or force that man tries to acquire from his
totem-animal or his god. But there is also a negative side to be
considered: there is not only the <i>mana</i>, but the <i>tabu</i>, the Forbidden,
the Thing Feared. We must cast away the old year; we must put our sins
on to a <ins class="greek" title="pharmakos">&#966;&#945;&#961;&#956;&#945;&#954;&#8057;&#962;</ins> or scapegoat and drive it out. When the ghosts have
returned and feasted with us at the Anthesteria we must, with tar and
branches of buckthorn, purge them out of every corner of the rooms till
the air is pure from the infection of death. We must avoid speaking
dangerous words; in great moments we must avoid speaking any words at
all, lest there should be even in the most innocent of them some unknown
danger; for we are surrounded above and below by K&ecirc;res, or Spirits,
winged influences, shapeless or of unknown shape, sometimes the spirits
of death, sometimes of disease, madness, calamity; thousands and
thousands of them, as Sarpedon says, from whom man can never escape nor
hide;<A NAME="an_fr_34_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_34_1">34_1</A> 'all the air so crowded with them', says an unknown ancient
poet, 'that there is not one empty chink into which you could push the
spike of a blade of corn.'<A NAME="an_fr_34_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_34_2">34_2</A></p>

<p>The extraordinary security of our modern life in times of peace makes it
hard for us to realize, except by a definite effort of the imagination,
the constant precariousness, the frightful proximity of death, that was
usual in these weak ancient communities. They were in fear of wild
beasts; they were helpless <a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="green">p. 35</font></A> against floods, helpless against
pestilences. Their food depended on the crops of one tiny plot of
ground; and if the Saviour was not reborn with the spring, they slowly
and miserably died. And all the while they knew almost nothing of the
real causes that made crops succeed or fail. They only felt sure it was
somehow a matter of pollution, of unexpiated defilement. It is this
state of things that explains the curious cruelty of early agricultural
doings, the human sacrifices, the scapegoats, the tearing in pieces of
living animals, and perhaps of living men, the steeping of the fields in
blood. Like most cruelty it has its roots in terror, terror of the
breach of <i>Tabu</i>&mdash;the Forbidden Thing. I will not dwell on this side of
the picture: it is well enough known. But we have to remember that, like
so many morbid growths of the human mind, it has its sublime side. We
must not forget that the human victims were often volunteers. The
records of Carthage and Jerusalem, the long list in Greek legend of
princes and princesses who died for their country, tell the same story.
In most human societies, savage as well as civilized, it is not hard to
find men who are ready to endure death for their fellow-citizens. We
need not suppose that the martyrs were always the noblest of the human
race. They were sometimes mad&mdash;hysterical or megalomaniac: sometimes
reckless and desperate: sometimes, as in the curious case attested of
the Roman armies on the Danube, they were men of strong desires and weak
imagination ready to die at the end of a short period, if in the
meantime they might glut all their senses with unlimited
indulgence.<A NAME="an_fr_35_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fn_35_1">35_1</A></p>

<p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="green">p. 36</font></A> </p><p>Still, when all is said, there is nothing that stirs men's imagination
like the contemplation of martyrdom, and it is no wonder that the more
emotional cults of antiquity vibrate with the worship of this dying
Saviour, the S&ocirc;sipolis, the S&ocirc;t&ecirc;r, who in so many forms dies with his
world or for his world, and rises again as the world rises, triumphant
through suffering over Death and the broken <i>Tabu</i>.</p>

<p><i>Tabu</i> is at first sight a far more prominent element in the primitive
religions than <i>Mana</i>, just as misfortune and crime are more highly
coloured and striking than prosperity and decent behaviour. To an early
Greek tribe the world of possible action was sharply divided between
what was Themis and what was Not Themis, between lawful and <i>tabu</i>, holy
and unholy, correct and forbidden. To do a thing that was not Themis was
a sure source of public disaster. Consequently it was of the first
necessity in a life full of such perils to find out the exact rules
about them. How is that to be managed? Themis is ancient law: it is <ins class="greek" title="ta
patria">&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#8049;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#945;</ins>, the way of our ancestors, the thing that has always been done
and is therefore divinely right. In ordinary life, of course, Themis is
clear. Every one knows it. But from time to time new emergencies arise,
the like of which we have never seen, and they frighten us. We must go
to the Gerontes, the Old Men of the Tribe; they will perhaps remember
what our fathers did. What they tell us will be <i>Presbiston</i>, a word
which means indifferently 'oldest' and 'best'&mdash;<ins class="greek" title="aiei de ne&ocirc;teroi
aphradeousin">&#945;&#7984;&#949;&#8054; &#948;&#8050; &#957;&#949;&#8061;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#953; &#7936;&#966;&#961;&#945;&#948;&#8051;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</ins>, 'Young men are always being foolish'. <a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="green">p. 37</font></A> Of course, if
there is a Basileus, a holy King, he by his special power may perhaps
know best of all, though he too must take care not to gainsay the Old
Men.</p>

<p>For the whole problem is to find out <ins class="greek" title="ta patria">&#964;&#8048; &#960;&#8049;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#945;</ins>, the ways that our
fathers followed. And suppose the Old Men themselves fail us, what must
we needs do? Here we come to a famous and peculiar Greek custom, for
which I have never seen quoted any exact parallel or any satisfactory
explanation. If the Old Men fail us, we must go to those older still, go
to our great ancestors, the <ins class="greek" title="h&ecirc;r&ocirc;es">&#7973;&#961;&#969;&#949;&#962;</ins>, the Chthonian people, lying in
their sacred tombs, and ask them to help. The word <ins class="greek" title="chran">&#967;&#961;&#8118;&#957;</ins> means both
'to lend money' and 'to give an oracle', two ways of helping people in
an emergency. Sometimes a tribe might happen to have a real ancestor
buried in the neighbourhood; if so, his tomb would be an oracle. More
often perhaps, for the memories of savage tribes are very precarious,
there would be no well-recorded personal tomb. The oracle would be at
some place sacred to the Chthonian people in general, or to some
particular personification of them, a Delphi or a cave of Troph&ocirc;nius, a
place of Snakes and Earth. You go to the Chthonian folk for guidance
because they are themselves the Oldest of the Old Ones, and they know
the real custom: they know what is Presbiston, what is Themis. And by an
easy extension of this knowledge they are also supposed to know what is.
He who knows the law fully to the uttermost also knows what will happen
if the law is broken. It is, I think, important to realize that the
normal reason for consulting an oracle was not to ask questions of fact.
It was that some emergency had arisen in which men simply wanted to know
how they ought to behave. The advice they received in this way varied
from <a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="green">p. 38</font></A> the virtuous to the abominable, as the religion itself varied. A
great mass of oracles can be quoted enjoining the rules of customary
morality, justice, honesty, piety, duty to a man's parents, to the old,
and to the weak. But of necessity the oracles hated change and strangled
the progress of knowledge. Also, like most manifestations of early
religion, they throve upon human terror: the more blind the terror the
stronger became their hold. In such an atmosphere the lowest and most
beastlike elements of humanity tended to come to the front; and religion
no doubt as a rule joined with them in drowning the voice of criticism
and of civilization, that is, of reason and of mercy. When really
frightened the oracle generally fell back on some remedy full of pain
and blood. The medieval plan of burning heretics alive had not yet been
invented. But the history of uncivilized man, if it were written, would
provide a vast list of victims, all of them innocent, who died or
suffered to expiate some portent or <i>monstrum</i>&mdash;some reported
<ins class="greek" title="teras">&#964;&#8051;&#961;&#945;&#962;</ins>&mdash;with which they had nothing whatever to do, which was in no way
altered by their suffering, which probably never really happened at all,
and if it did was of no consequence. The sins of the modern world in
dealing with heretics and witches have perhaps been more gigantic than
those of primitive men, but one can hardy rise from the record of these
ancient observances without being haunted by the judgement of the Roman
poet:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum,</span><br />
</p>

<p>and feeling with him that the lightening of this cloud, the taming of
this blind dragon, must rank among the very greatest services that
Hellenism wrought for mankind.</p>

<h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><A NAME="an_fn_6_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fr_6_1">6_1</A> Professor &Eacute;mile Durkheim in his famous analysis of the
religious emotions argues that when a man feels the belief and the
command as something coming from without, superior, authoritative, of
infinite import, it is because religion is the work of the tribe and, as
such, superior to the individual. The voice of God is the imagined voice
of the whole tribe, heard or imagined by him who is going to break its
laws. I have some difficulty about the psychology implied in this
doctrine: surely the apparent externality of the religious command seems
to belong to a fairly common type of experience, in which the
personality is divided, so that first one part of it and then another
emerges into consciousness. If you forget an engagement, sometimes your
peace is disturbed for quite a long time by a vague external annoyance
or condemnation, which at last grows to be a distinct
judgement&mdash;'Heavens! I ought to be at the Committee on So-and-so.' But
apart from this criticism, there is obviously much historical truth in
Professor Durkheim's theory, and it is not so different as it seems at
first sight from the ordinary beliefs of religious men. The tribe to
primitive man is not a mere group of human beings. It is his whole
world. The savage who is breaking the laws of his tribe has all his
world&mdash;totems, tabus, earth, sky and all&mdash;against him. He cannot be at
peace with God.</p>

<p>The position of the hero or martyr who defies his tribe for the sake of
what he thinks the truth or the right can easily be thought out on these
lines. He defies this false temporary Cosmos in loyalty to the true and
permanent Cosmos.</p>

<p>See Durkheim, 'Les Formes &eacute;l&eacute;mentaires de la vie religieuse', in
<i>Travaux de l'Ann&eacute;e Sociologique</i>, 1912; or G. Davy, 'La Sociologie de
M. Durkheim', in <i>Rev. Philosophique</i>, xxxvi, pp. 42-71 and 160-85.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><A NAME="an_fn_8_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr05.htm#an_fr_8_1">8_1</A> I suspect that most reforms pass through this stage. A
man somehow feels clear that some new course is, for him, right, though
he cannot marshal the arguments convincingly in favour of it, and may
even admit that the weight of obvious evidence is on the other side. We
read of judges in the seventeenth century who believed that witches
ought to be burned and that the persons before them were witches, and
yet would not burn them&mdash;evidently under the influence of vague
half-realized feelings. I know a vegetarian who thinks that, as far as
he can see, carnivorous habits are not bad for human health and actually
tend to increase the happiness of the species of animals eaten&mdash;as the
adoption of Swift's <i>Modest Proposal</i> would doubtless relieve the
economic troubles of the human race, and yet feels clear that for him
the ordinary flesh meal (or 'feasting on corpses') would 'partake of the
nature of sin'. The path of progress is paved with inconsistencies,
though it would be an error to imagine that the people who habitually
reject any higher promptings that come to them are really any more
consistent.</p></div>

island of Thera, <i>I. G. I.</i> iii. 329. This gives a god Anthister, who is
clearly identified with Dionysus, and seems to be a projection of a
feast Anthisteria = Anthesteria. The inscription is of the second
century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> and it seems likely that Anthister-Anthisteria, with their
clear derivation from <ins class="greek" title="anthizein">&#7936;&#957;&#952;&#8055;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;</ins>, are corruptions of the earlier and

island lying rather outside the main channels of civilization, kept up
throughout its history a tendency to treat the 'epithet' as a full
person. Hikesios and Koures come very early; also Polieus and Stoichaios
without the name Zeus; Delphinios, Karneios, Aiglatas, and Aguieus
without Apollo.

enormous families attributed to many sacred kings of Greek legend: why
Priam or Danaus have their fifty children, and Heracles, most prolific
of all, his several hundred. The particular numbers chosen, however, are
probably due to other causes, e. g. the fifty moon-months of the
