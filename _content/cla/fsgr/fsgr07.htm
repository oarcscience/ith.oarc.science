<h3>THE GREAT SCHOOLS OF THE FOURTH CENTURY, B. C.</h3>


<p>There is a passage in Xenophon describing how, one summer night, in 405
<span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, people in Athens heard a cry of wailing, an <i>oim&ocirc;g&ecirc;</i>, making its
way up between the long walls from the Piraeus, and coming nearer and
nearer as they listened. It was the news of the final disaster of
Kynoskephalai, brought at midnight to the Piraeus by the galley Paralos.
'And that night no one slept. They wept for the dead, but far more
bitterly for themselves, when they reflected what things they had done
to the people of M&ecirc;los, when taken by siege, to the people of Histiaea,
and Sk&icirc;on&ecirc; and Tor&ocirc;n&ecirc; and Aeg&icirc;na, and many more of the Hellenes.'<A NAME="an_fr_79_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_79_1">79_1</A></p>

<p>The echo of that lamentation seems to ring behind most of the literature
of the fourth century, and not the Athenian literature alone. Defeat can
on occasion leave men their self-respect or even their pride; as it did
after Chaeronea in 338 and after the Chremonidean War in 262, not to
speak of Thermopylae. But the defeat of 404 not only left Athens at the
mercy of her enemies. It stripped her of those things of which she had
been inwardly most proud; her 'wisdom', her high civilization, her
leadership of all that was most Hellenic in Hellas. The 'Beloved City'
of Pericles had become a tyrant, her nature poisoned by war, her
government a by-word in Greece for brutality. And <a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="green">p. 80</font></A> Greece as a whole
felt the tragedy of it. It is curious how this defeat of Athens by
Sparta seems to have been felt abroad as a defeat for Greece itself and
for the hopes of the Greek city state. The fall of Athens mattered more
than the victory of Lysander. Neither Sparta nor any other city ever
attempted to take her place. And no writer after the year 400 speaks of
any other city as Pericles used to speak of fifth-century Athens, not
even Polybius 250 years later, when he stands amazed before the solidity
and the 'fortune' of Rome.</p>

<p>The city state, the Polis, had concentrated upon itself almost all the
loyalty and the aspirations of the Greek mind. It gave security to life.
It gave meaning to religion. And in the fall of Athens it had failed. In
the third century, when things begin to recover, we find on the one hand
the great military monarchies of Alexander's successors, and on the
other, a number of federations of tribes, which were generally strongest
in the backward regions where the city state had been least developed.
<ins class="greek" title="To koinon t&ocirc;n Ait&ocirc;l&ocirc;n">&#932;&#8056; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#8056;&#957; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#913;&#7984;&#964;&#969;&#955;&#8182;&#957;</ins> or <ins class="greek" title="t&ocirc;n Achai&ocirc;n">&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7944;&#967;&#945;&#953;&#8182;&#957;</ins> had become more important than
Athens or Corinth, and Sparta was only strong by means of a
League.<A NAME="an_fr_80_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_80_1">80_1</A> By that time the Polis was recognized as a comparatively
weak social organism, capable of very high culture but not quite able,
as the Covenant of the League of Nations expresses it, 'to hold its own
under the strenuous conditions of modern life'. Besides, it was not now
ruled by the best citizens. The best had turned away from politics.</p>

<p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="green">p. 81</font></A> </p><p>This great discouragement did not take place at a blow. Among the
practical statesmen probably most did not form any theory about the
cause of the failure but went on, as practical statesmen must, doing as
best they could from difficulty to difficulty. But many saw that the
fatal danger to Greece was disunion, as many see it in Europe now. When
Macedon proved indisputably stronger than Athens Isocrates urged Philip
to accept the leadership of Greece against the barbarian and against
barbarism. He might thus both unite the Greek cities and also evangelize
the world. Lysias, the democratic and anti-Spartan orator, had been
groping for a similar solution as early as 384 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, and was prepared
to make an even sharper sacrifice for it. He appealed at Olympia for a
crusade of all the free Greek cities against Dionysius of Syracuse, and
begged Sparta herself to lead it. The Spartans are 'of right the leaders
of Hellas by their natural nobleness and their skill in war. They alone
live still in a city unsacked, unwalled, unconquered, uncorrupted by
faction, and have followed always the same modes of life. They have been
the saviours of Hellas in the past, and one may hope that their freedom
will be everlasting.'<A NAME="an_fr_81_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_81_1">81_1</A> A great and generous change in one who had
'learned by suffering' in the Peloponnesian War. Others no doubt merely
gave their submission to the stronger powers that were now rising. There
were openings for counsellors, for mercenary soldiers, for court savants
and philosophers and poets, and, of course, for agents in every free
city who were prepared for one motive or another not to kick against the
pricks. And there were always also those who had neither <a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="green">p. 82</font></A> learned nor
forgotten, the unrepentant idealists; too passionate or too heroic or,
as some will say, too blind, to abandon their life-long devotion to
'Athens' or to 'Freedom' because the world considered such ideals out of
date. They could look the ruined Athenians in the face, after the lost
battle, and say with Demosthenes, '<ins class="greek" title="Ouk estin, ouk estin hop&ocirc;s
h&ecirc;martete">&#927;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;, &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#8005;&#960;&#969;&#962; &#7969;&#956;&#8049;&#961;&#964;&#949;&#964;&#949;</ins>. It cannot be that you did wrong, it cannot be!'<A NAME="an_fr_82_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_82_1">82_1</A></p>

<p>But in practical politics the currents of thought are inevitably
limited. It is in philosophy and speculation that we find the richest
and most varied reaction to the Great Failure. It takes different shapes
in those writers, like Plato and Xenophon, who were educated in the
fifth century and had once believed in the Great City, and those whose
whole thinking life belonged to the time of disillusion.</p>

<p>Plato was disgusted with democracy and with Athens, but he retained his
faith in the city, if only the city could be set on the right road.
There can be little doubt that he attributes to the bad government of
the Demos many evils which were really due to extraneous causes or to
the mere fallibility of human nature. Still his analysis of democracy is
one of the most brilliant things in the history of political theory. It
is so acute, so humorous, so affectionate; and at many different ages of
the world has seemed like a portrait of the actual contemporary society.
Like a modern popular newspaper, Plato's democracy makes it its business
to satisfy existing desires and give people a 'good time'. It does not
distinguish between higher and lower. Any one man is as good as another,
and so is any impulse or any idea. Consequently the commoner have the
pull. <a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="green">p. 83</font></A> Even the great democratic statesmen of the past, he now sees,
have been ministers to mob desires; they have 'filled the city with
harbours and docks and walls and revenues and such-like trash, without
Sophrosyn&ecirc; and righteousness'. The sage or saint has no place in
practical politics. He would be like a man in a den of wild beasts. Let
him and his like seek shelter as best they can, standing up behind some
wall while the storm of dust and sleet rages past. The world does not
want truth, which is all that he could give it. It goes by appearances
and judges its great men with their clothes on and their rich relations
round them. After death, the judges will judge them naked, and alone;
and then we shall see!<A NAME="an_fr_83_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_83_1">83_1</A></p>

<p>Yet, in spite of all this, the child of the fifth century cannot keep
his mind from politics. The speculations which would be scouted by the
mass in the marketplace can still be discussed with intimate friends and
disciples, or written in books for the wise to read. Plato's two longest
works are attempts to construct an ideal society; first, what may be
called a City of Righteousness, in the <i>Republic</i>; and afterwards in
his old age, in the <i>Laws</i>, something more like a City of Refuge,
uncontaminated by the world; a little city on a hill-top away in Crete,
remote from commerce and riches and the 'bitter and corrupting sea'
which carries them; a city where life shall move in music and discipline
and reverence for the things that are greater than man, and the songs
men sing shall be not common songs but the preambles of the city's laws,
showing <a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="green">p. 84</font></A> their purpose and their principle; where no wall will be
needed to keep out the possible enemy, because the courage and
temperance of the citizens will be wall enough, and if war comes the
women equally with the men 'will fight for their young, as birds do'.</p>

<p>This hope is very like despair; but, such as it is, Plato's thought is
always directed towards the city. No other form of social life ever
tempts him away, and he anticipates no insuperable difficulty in keeping
the city in the right path if once he can get it started right. The
first step, the necessary revolution, is what makes the difficulty. And
he sees only one way. In real life he had supported the conspiracy of
the extreme oligarchs in 404 which led to the rule of the 'Thirty
Tyrants'; but the experience sickened him of such methods. There was no
hope unless, by some lucky combination, a philosopher should become a
king or some young king turn philosopher. 'Give me a city governed by a
tyrant,' he says in the <i>Laws</i>,<A NAME="an_fr_84_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_84_1">84_1</A> 'and let the tyrant be young, with
a good memory, quick at learning, of high courage, and a generous
nature.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And besides, let him have a wise counsellor!' Ironical
fortune granted him an opportunity to try the experiment himself at the
court of Syracuse, first with the elder and then, twenty years later,
with the younger Dionysius (387 and 367 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>). It is a story of
disappointment, of course; bitter, humiliating and ludicrous
disappointment, but with a touch of that sublimity which seems so often
to hang about the errors of the wise. One can study them in Seneca at
the court of Nero, or in Turgot with Louis; not so well perhaps in
Voltaire with Frederick. Plato <a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="green">p. 85</font></A> failed in his enterprise, but he did
keep faith with the 'Righteous City'.</p>

<p>Another of the Socratic circle turned in a different direction.
Xenophon, an exile from his country, a brilliant soldier and adventurer
as well as a man of letters, is perhaps the first Greek on record who
openly lost interest in the city. He thought less about cities and
constitutions than about great men and nations, or generals and armies.
To him it was idle to spin cobweb formations of ideal laws and
communities. Society is right enough if you have a really fine man to
lead it. It may be that his ideal was formed in childhood by stories of
Pericles and the great age when Athens was 'in name a democracy but in
truth an empire of one leading man'. He gave form to his dream in the
<i>Education of Cyrus</i>, an imaginary account of the training which formed
Cyrus the Great into an ideal king and soldier. The <i>Cyropaedeia</i> is
said to have been intended as a counterblast to Plato's <i>Republic</i>, and
it may have provoked Plato's casual remark in the <i>Laws</i> that 'Cyrus
never so much as touched education'. No doubt the book suffered in
persuasiveness from being so obviously fictitious.<A NAME="an_fr_85_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_85_1">85_1</A> For example,
the Cyrus of Xenophon dies peacefully in his bed after much affectionate
and edifying advice to his family, whereas all Athens knew from
Herodotus how the real Cyrus had been killed in a war against the
Massagetae, and his head, to slake its thirst for that liquid, plunged
into a wineskin full of human blood. Perhaps also the monarchical rule
of Cyrus was too absolute for Greek <a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="green">p. 86</font></A> taste. At any rate, later on
Xenophon adopted a more real hero, whom he had personally known and
admired.</p>

<p>Agesilaus, king of Sparta, had been taken as a type of 'virtue' even by
the bitter historian Theopompus. Agesilaus was not only a great general.
He knew how to 'honour the gods, do his duty in the field, and to
practise obedience'. He was true to friend and foe. On one memorable
occasion he kept his word even to an enemy who had broken his. He
enjoined kindness to enemy captives. When he found small children left
behind by the barbarians in some town that he occupied&mdash;because either
their parents or the slave-merchants had no room for them&mdash;he always
took care of them or gave them to guardians of their own race: 'he never
let the dogs and wolves get them'. On the other hand, when he sold his
barbarian prisoners he sent them to market naked, regardless of their
modesty, because it cheered his own soldiers to see how white and fat
they were. He wept when he won a victory over Greeks; 'for he loved all
Greeks and only hated barbarians'. When he returned home after his
successful campaigns, he obeyed the orders of the ephors without
question; his house and furniture were as simple as those of a common
man, and his daughter the princess, when she went to and fro to Amyclae,
went simply in the public omnibus. He reared chargers and hunting dogs;
the rearing of chariot horses he thought effeminate. But he advised his
sister Cynisca about hers, and she won the chariot race at Olympia.
'Have a king like that', says Xenophon, 'and all will be well. He will
govern right; he will beat your enemies; and he will set an example of
good life. If you want Virtue in the state look for it in a good <a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="green">p. 87</font></A> man,
not in a speculative tangle of laws. The Spartan constitution, as it
stands, is good enough for any one.'</p>

<p>But it was another of the great Socratics who uttered first the
characteristic message of the fourth century, and met the blows of
Fortune with a direct challenge. Antisthenes was a man twenty years
older than Plato. He had fought at Tanagra in 426 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> He had been
friends with Gorgias and Prodicus, the great Sophists of the Periclean
age. He seems to have been, at any rate till younger and more brilliant
men cut him out, the recognized philosophic heir of Socrates.<A NAME="an_fr_87_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_87_1">87_1</A> And
late in life, after the fall of Athens and the condemnation and death of
his master, the man underwent a curious change of heart. He is taunted
more than once with the lateness of his discovery of truth,<A NAME="an_fr_87_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_87_2">87_2</A> and
with his childish subservience to the old <i>jeux d'esprit</i> of the
Sceptics which professed to prove the impossibility of knowledge.<A NAME="an_fr_87_3"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_87_3">87_3</A>
It seems that he had lost faith in speculation and dialectic and the
elaborate <a name="page_88"><font size="1" color="green">p. 88</font></A> superstructures which Plato and others had built upon them;
and he felt, like many moralists after him, a sort of hostility to all
knowledge that was not immediately convertible into conduct.</p>

<p>But this scepticism was only part of a general disbelief in the world.
Greek philosophy had from the first been concerned with a fundamental
question which we moderns seldom put clearly to ourselves. It asked
'What is the Good?' meaning thereby 'What is the element of value in
life?' or 'What should be our chief aim in living?' A medieval Christian
would have answered without hesitation 'To go to Heaven and not be
damned', and would have been prepared with the necessary prescriptions
for attaining that end. But the modern world is not intensely enough
convinced of the reality of Sin and Judgement, Hell and Heaven, to
accept this answer as an authoritative guide in life, and has not
clearly thought out any other. The ancient Greek spent a great part of
his philosophical activity in trying, without propounding supernatural
rewards and punishments, or at least without laying stress on them, to
think out what the Good of man really was.</p>

<p>The answers given by mankind to this question seem to fall under two
main heads. Before a battle if both parties were asked what aim they
were pursuing, both would say without hesitation 'Victory'. After the
battle, the conqueror would probably say that his purpose was in some
way to consolidate or extend his victory; but the beaten party, as soon
as he had time to think, would perhaps explain that, after all, victory
was not everything. It was better to have fought for the right, to have
done your best and to have failed, <a name="page_89"><font size="1" color="green">p. 89</font></A> than to revel in the prosperity of
the unjust. And, since it is difficult to maintain, in the midst of the
triumph of the enemy and your own obvious misery and humiliation, that
all is well and you yourself thoroughly contented, this second answer
easily develops a third: 'Wait a little, till God's judgement asserts
itself; and see who has the best of it then!' There will be a rich
reward hereafter for the suffering virtuous.</p>

<p>The typical Athenian of the Periclean age would have been in the first
state of mind. His 'good' would be in the nature of success: to spread
Justice and Freedom, to make Athens happy and strong and her laws wise
and equal for rich and poor. Antisthenes had fallen violently into the
second. He was defeated together with all that he most cared for, and he
comforted himself with the thought that nothing matters except to have
done your best. As he phrased it <i>Aret&ecirc; is the good</i>, Aret&ecirc; meaning
'virtue' or 'goodness', the quality of a good citizen, a good father, a
good dog, a good sword.</p>

<p>The things of the world are vanity, and philosophy as vain as the rest.
Nothing but goodness is good; and the first step towards attaining it is
to repent.</p>

<p>There was in Athens a gymnasium built for those who were base-born and
could not attend the gymnasia of true citizens. It was called Kynosarges
and was dedicated to the great bastard, Heracles. Antisthenes, though he
had moved hitherto in the somewhat patrician circle of the Socratics,
remembered how that his mother was a Thracian slave, and set up his
school in Kynosarges among the disinherited of the earth. He made
friends with the 'bad,' who needed befriending. <a name="page_90"><font size="1" color="green">p. 90</font></A> He dressed like the
poorest workman. He would accept no disciples except those who could
bear hardship, and was apt to drive new-comers away with his stick. Yet
he also preached in the streets, both in Athens and Corinth. He preached
rhetorically, with parables and vivid emotional phrases, compelling the
attention of the crowd. His eloquence was held to be bad style, and it
started the form of literature known to the Cynics as <ins class="greek" title="chreia">&#967;&#961;&#949;&#8055;&#945;</ins>, 'a
help', or <ins class="greek" title="diatrib&ecirc;">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#946;&#8053;</ins>, 'a study', and by the Christians as <ins class="greek" title="homilia">&#8001;&#956;&#953;&#955;&#8055;&#945;</ins>, a
'homily' or sermon.</p>

<p>This passionate and ascetic old man would have attracted the interest of
the world even more, had it not been for one of his disciples. This was
a young man from Sinope, on the Euxine, whom he did not take to at first
sight; the son of a disreputable money-changer who had been sent to
prison for defacing the coinage. Antisthenes ordered the lad away, but
he paid no attention; he beat him with his stick, but he never moved. He
wanted 'wisdom', and saw that Antisthenes had it to give. His aim in
life was to do as his father had done, to 'deface the coinage', but on a
much larger scale. He would deface all the coinage current in the world.
Every conventional stamp was false. The men stamped as generals and
kings; the things stamped as honour and wisdom and happiness and riches;
all were base metal with lying superscriptions. All must have the stamp
defaced.<A NAME="an_fr_90_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_90_1">90_1</A></p>

<p>This young man was Diogenes, afterwards the most famous of all the
Cynics. He started by rejecting all stamps and superscriptions and
holding that nothing but <i>Aret&ecirc;</i>, 'worth' or 'goodness', was good. He
<a name="page_91"><font size="1" color="green">p. 91</font></A> rejected tradition. He rejected the current religion and the rules and
customs of temple worship. True religion was a thing of the spirit, and
needed no forms. He despised divination. He rejected civil life and
marriage. He mocked at the general interest in the public games and the
respect paid to birth, wealth, or reputation. Let man put aside these
delusions and know himself. And for his defences let him arm himself
'against Fortune with courage, against Convention with Nature, against
passion with Reason'. For Reason is 'the god within us'.</p>

<p>The salvation for man was to return to Nature, and Diogenes interpreted
this return in the simplest and crudest way. He should live like the
beasts, like primeval men, like barbarians. Were not the beasts blessed,
<ins class="greek" title="rheia z&ocirc;ontes">&#8165;&#949;&#8150;&#945; &#950;&#8061;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</ins> like the Gods in Homer? And so, though in less
perfection, were primitive men, not vexing their hearts with imaginary
sins and conventions. Travellers told of savages who married their
sisters, or ate human flesh, or left their dead unburied. Why should
they not, if they wished to? No wonder Zeus punished Prometheus the
Fire-Bringer, who had brought all this progress upon us and left man
civilized and more unhappy than any beast! He deserved his crag and his
vulture!</p>

<p>Diogenes took his mission with great earnestness. He was leader in a
'great battle against Pleasures and Desires'. He was 'the servant, the
message-bearer, sent by Zeus', 'the Setter-Free of mankind' and the
'Healer of passions'.</p>

<p>The life that he personally meant to live, and which he recommended to
the wise, was what he called <ins class="greek" title="ton kynikon bion">&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#954;&#965;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957; &#946;&#8055;&#959;&#957;</ins>, 'a dog's life', and he
himself wished to <a name="page_92"><font size="1" color="green">p. 92</font></A> be a 'cynic' or 'canine'. A dog was brave and
faithful; it had no bodily shame, no false theories, and few wants. A
dog needed no clothes, no house, no city, no possessions, no titles;
what he did need was 'virtue', Aret&ecirc;, to catch his prey, to fight wild
beasts, and to defend his master; and that he could provide for himself.
Diogenes found, of course, that he needed a little more than an ordinary
dog; a blanket, a wallet or bowl to hold his food, and a staff a 'to
beat off dogs and bad men'. It was the regular uniform of a beggar. He
asked for no house. There was a huge earthen pitcher&mdash;not a tub&mdash;outside
the Temple of the Great Mother; the sort of vessel that was used for
burial in primitive Greece and which still had about it the associations
of a coffin. Diogenes slept there when he wanted shelter, and it became
the nearest approach to a home that he had. Like a dog he performed any
bodily act without shame, when and where he chose. He obeyed no human
laws because he recognized no city. He was <i>Cosmopol&icirc;tes</i>, Citizen of
the Universe; all men, and all beasts too, were his brothers. He lived
preaching in the streets and begging his bread; except that he did not
'beg', he 'commanded'. Other folk obeyed his commands because they were
still slaves, while he 'had never been a slave again since Antisthenes
set him free'. He had no fear, because there was nothing to take from
him. Only slaves are afraid.</p>

<p>Greece rang with stories of his mordant wit, and every bitter saying
became fathered on Diogenes. Every one knew how Alexander the Great had
come to see the famous beggar and, standing before him where he sat in
the open air, had asked if there was <a name="page_93"><font size="1" color="green">p. 93</font></A> any boon he could confer on him.
'Yes, move from between me and the sun.' They knew the king's saying,
'If I were not Alexander I would be Diogenes', and the polite answer 'If
I were not Diogenes I would be Alexander'. The Master of the World and
the Rejector of the World met on an equality. People told too how the
Cynic walked about with a lamp in the daytime searching, so he said,
'for a man'. They knew his scorn of the Mysteries with their doctrine of
exclusive salvation; was a thief to be in bliss because he was
initiated, while Agesilaus and Epaminondas were in outer darkness? A few
of the stories are more whimsical. A workman carrying a pole
accidentally hit Diogenes and cried 'Look out!' 'Why,' said he, 'are you
going to hit me again?'</p>

<p>He had rejected patriotism as he rejected culture. Yet he suffered as he
saw Greece under the Macedonians and Greek liberties disappearing. When
his death was approaching some disciple asked his wishes about his
burial; 'Let the dogs and wolves have me,' he said; 'I should like to be
of some use to my brothers when I die.' When this request was refused
his thoughts turned again to the Macedonian Wars; 'Bury me face
downwards; everything is soon going to be turned the other way up.'</p>

<p>He remains the permanent and unsurpassed type of one way of grappling
with the horror of life. Fear nothing, desire nothing, possess nothing:
and then Life with all its ingenuity of malice cannot disappoint you. If
man cannot enter into life nor yet depart from it save through agony and
filth, let him learn to endure the one and be indifferent to the other.
The watchdog of Zeus on earth has to fulfil his special <a name="page_94"><font size="1" color="green">p. 94</font></A> duty, to warn
mankind of the truth and to set slaves free. Nothing else matters.</p>

<p>The criticism of this solution is not that it is selfish. It is not. The
Cynic lives for the salvation of his fellow creatures. And it is worth
remembering that before the Roman gladiatorial games were eventually
stopped by the self-immolation of the monk Telemachus, two Cynic
philosophers had thrown themselves into the arena in the same spirit.
Its weakness lies in a false psychology, common to all the world at that
time, which imagined that salvation or freedom consists in living
utterly without desire or fear, that such a life is biologically
possible, and that Diogenes lived it. To a subtler critic it is obvious
that Diogenes was a man of very strong and successful ambitions, though
his ambitions were different from those of most men. He solved the
problem of his own life by following with all the force and courage of
his genius a line of conduct which made him, next to Alexander, the most
famous man in Greece. To be really without fear or desire would mean
death, and to die is not to solve the riddle of living.</p>

<p>The difference between the Cynic view of life and that of Plato's
<i>Republic</i> is interesting. Plato also rejected the most fundamental
conventions of existing society, the accepted methods of government, the
laws of property and of marriage, the traditional religion and even the
poetry which was a second religion to the Greeks. But he rejected the
existing culture only because he wanted it to be better. He condemned
the concrete existing city in order to build a more perfect city, to
proceed in infinite searching and longing towards the Idea of Good, the
Sun of the spiritual <a name="page_95"><font size="1" color="green">p. 95</font></A> universe. Diogenes rejected the civilization which
he saw, and admitted the reality of no other. His crude realistic
attitude of mind had no use for Plato's 'Ideas'. 'I can see a table,' he
said; 'I cannot see Tabularity' (<ins class="greek" title="trapezot&ecirc;s">&#964;&#961;&#945;&#960;&#949;&#950;&#8057;&#964;&#951;&#962;</ins>). 'I know Athens and
Corinth and other cities, and can see that they are all bad. As for the
Ideal Society, show it me and I will say what I think.'</p>

<p>In spite of its false psychology the Cynic conception of life had a
great effect in Greece. It came almost as a revelation to both men and
women<A NAME="an_fr_95_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_95_1">95_1</A> and profoundly influenced all the Schools. Here indeed, it
seemed, was a way to baffle Fortune and to make one's own soul unafraid.
What men wanted was <ins class="greek" title="to tharrein">&#964;&#8056; &#952;&#945;&#961;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</ins> 'to be of good cheer'; as we say now,
to regain their <i>morale</i> after bewildering defeats. The Cynic answer,
afterwards corrected and humanized by the Stoics, was to look at life as
a long and arduous campaign. The loyal soldier does not trouble about
his comfort or his rewards or his pleasures. He obeys his commander's
orders without fear or failing, whether they lead to easy victories or
merely to wounds, captivity or death. Only Goodness is good, and for the
soldier Goodness <a name="page_96"><font size="1" color="green">p. 96</font></A> (<ins class="greek" title="aret&ecirc;">&#7936;&#961;&#949;&#964;&#8053;</ins>) is the doing of Duty. That is his true
prize, which no external power can take away from him.</p>

<p>But after all, what is Duty? Diogenes preached 'virtue' and assumed that
his way of life was 'virtue'. But was it really so? And, if so, on what
evidence? To live like a beast, to be indifferent to art, beauty,
letters, science, philosophy, to the amenities of civic life, to all
that raised Hellenic Man above the beast or the savage? How could this
be the true end of man? The Stoic School, whose founder, Zeno, was a
disciple of old Antisthenes, gradually built up a theory of moral life
which has on the whole weathered the storms of time with great success.
It largely dominated later antiquity by its imaginative and emotional
power. It gave form to the aspirations of early Christianity. It lasts
now as the nearest approach to an acceptable system of conduct for those
who do not accept revelation, but still keep some faith in the Purpose
of Things.</p>

<p>The problem is to combine the absolute value of that Goodness which, as
we say, 'saves the soul' with the relative values of the various good
things that soothe or beautify life. For, if there is any value at
all&mdash;I will not say in health and happiness, but in art, poetry,
knowledge, refinement, public esteem, or human affection, and if their
claims do clash, as in common opinion they sometimes do, with the
demands of absolute sanctity, how is the balance to be struck? Are we to
be content with the principle of accepting a little moral wrong for the
sake of much material or artistic or intellectual advantage? That is the
rule which the practical world follows, though without <a name="page_97"><font size="1" color="green">p. 97</font></A> talking about
it; but the Stoics would have none of any such compromise.</p>

<p>Zeno first, like Antisthenes, denied any value whatever to these earthly
things that are not virtue&mdash;to health or sickness, riches or poverty,
beauty or ugliness, pain or pleasure; who would ever mention them when
the soul stood naked before God? All that would then matter, and
consequently all that can ever matter, is the goodness of the man's
self, that is, of his free and living will. The Stoics improved on the
military metaphor; for to the soldier, after all, it does matter whether
in his part of the field he wins or loses. Life is not like a battle but
like a play, in which God has handed each man his part unread, and the
good man proceeds to act it to the best of his power, not knowing what
may happen in the last scene. He may become a crowned king, he may be a
slave dying in torment. What matters it? The good actor can play either
part. All that matters is that he shall act his best, accept the order
of the Cosmos and obey the Purpose of the great Dramaturge.</p>

<p>The answer seems absolute and unyielding, with no concession to the
weakness of the flesh. Yet, in truth, it contains in itself the germ of
a sublime practical compromise which makes Stoicism human. It accepts
the Cosmos and it obeys the Purpose; therefore there is a Cosmos, and
there is a purpose in the world. Stoicism, like much of ancient thought
at this period, was permeated by the new discoveries of astronomy and
their formation into a coherent scientific system, which remained
unshaken till the days of Copernicus. The stars, which had always moved
men's wonder and even worship, were now seen and proved to be no
<a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="green">p. 98</font></A> wandering fires but parts of an immense and apparently eternal order.
One star might differ from another star in glory, but they were all
alike in their obedience to law. They had their fixed courses, divine
though they were, which had been laid down for them by a Being greater
than they. The Order, or Cosmos, was a proven fact; therefore, the
Purpose was a proven fact; and, though in its completeness inscrutable,
it could at least in part be divined from the fact that all these varied
and eternal splendours had for their centre our Earth and its ephemeral
master. The Purpose, though it is not our Purpose, is especially
concerned with us and circles round us. It is the purpose of a God who
loves Man.</p>

<p>Let us forget that this system of astronomy has been overthrown, and
that we now know that Man is not the centre of the universe. Let us
forget that the majestic order which reigns, or seems to reign, among
the stars, is matched by a brutal conflict and a chaos of jarring
purposes in the realms of those sciences which deal with life.<A NAME="an_fr_98_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_98_1">98_1</A> If
we can recover the imaginative outlook of the generations which
stretched from, say, Meton in the fifth century before Christ to
Copernicus in the sixteenth after, we shall be able to understand the
spiritual exaltation with which men like Zeno or Poseidonius regarded
the world.</p>

<p><a name="page_99"><font size="1" color="green">p. 99</font></A> </p><p>We are part of an Order, a Cosmos, which we see to be infinitely above
our comprehension but which we know to be an expression of love for Man;
what can we do but accept it, not with resignation but with enthusiasm,
and offer to it with pride any sacrifice which it may demand of us. It
is a glory to suffer for such an end.</p>

<p>And there is more. For the Stars show only what may be called a
stationary purpose, an Order which is and remains for ever. But in the
rest of the world, we can see a moving Purpose. It is Phusis, the word
which the Romans unfortunately translated 'Natura', but which means
'Growing' or 'the way things grow'&mdash;almost what we call Evolution. But
to the Stoic it is a living and conscious evolution, a forethought or
<ins class="greek" title="Pronoia">&#928;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;</ins> in the mind of God, what the Romans called <i>providentia</i>,
guiding all things that grow in a direction which accords with the
divine will. And the direction, the Stoic pointed out, was not towards
mere happiness but towards <i>Aret&ecirc;</i>, or the perfection of each thing or
each species after its kind. <i>Phusis</i> shapes the acorn to grow into the
perfect oak, the blind puppy into the good hound; it makes the deer grow
in swiftness to perform the function of a deer, and man grow in power
and wisdom to perform the function of a man. If a man is an artist it is
his function to produce beauty; if he a governor, it is his function to
produce a flourishing and virtuous city. True, the things that he
produces are but shadows and in themselves utterly valueless; it matters
not one straw whether the deer goes at ten miles an hour or twenty,
whether the population of a city die this year of famine and sickness or
twenty years hence of old age. But it belongs to the <a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="green">p. 100</font></A> good governor to
avert famine and to produce healthy conditions, as it belongs to the
deer to run its best. So it is the part of a friend, if need arise, to
give his comfort or his life for a friend; of a mother to love and
defend her children; though it is true that in the light of eternity
these 'creaturely' affections shrivel into their native worthlessness.
If the will of God is done, and done willingly, all is well. You may, if
it brings you great suffering, feel the pain. You may even, through
human weakness, weep or groan; that can be forgiven. <ins class="greek" title="Es&ocirc;then mentoi m&ecirc;
stenax&ecirc;s">&#7964;&#963;&#969;&#952;&#949;&#957; &#956;&#8051;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#953; &#956;&#8052; &#963;&#964;&#949;&#957;&#8049;&#958;&#951;&#962;</ins>, 'But in the centre of your being groan not!' Accept the
Cosmos. Will joyously that which God wills and make the eternal Purpose
your own.</p>

<p>I will say no more of this great body of teaching, as I have dealt with
it in a separate publication.<A NAME="an_fr_100_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_100_1">100_1</A> But I would point out two special
advantages of a psychological kind which distinguish Stoicism from many
systems of philosophy. First, though it never consciously faced the
psychological problem of instinct, it did see clearly that man does not
necessarily pursue what pleases him most, or what is most profitable to
him, or even his 'good'. It saw that man can determine his end, and may
well choose pain in preference to pleasure. This saved the school from a
great deal of that false schematization which besets most forms of
rationalistic psychology. Secondly, it did build up a system of thought
on which, both in good days and evil, a life can be lived which is not
only saintly, but practically wise and human and beneficent. It did for
<a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="green">p. 101</font></A> practical purposes solve the problem of living, without despair and
without grave, or at least without gross, illusion.</p>

<p>The other great school of the fourth century, a school which, in the
matter of ethics, may be called the only true rival of Stoicism, was
also rooted in defeat. But it met defeat in a different spirit.<A NAME="an_fr_101_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_101_1">101_1</A>
Epicurus, son of Neocles, of the old Athenian clan of the Phila&iuml;dae, was
born on a colony in Samos in 341 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> His father was evidently poor;
else he would hardly have left Athens to live on a colonial farm, nor
have had to eke out his farming by teaching an elementary school. We do
not know how much the small boy learned from his father. But for older
students there was a famous school on the neighbouring island of Teos,
where a certain Nausiphanes taught the Ionian tradition of Mathematics
and Physics as well as rhetoric and literary subjects. Epicurus went to
this school when he was fourteen, and seems, among other things, to have
imbibed the Atomic Theory of Democritus without realizing that it was
anything peculiar. He felt afterwards as if his school-days had been
merely a waste of time. At the age of eighteen he went to Athens, the
centre of the philosophic world, but he only went, as Athenian citizens
were in duty bound, to perform his year of military service as
<i>eph&ecirc;bus</i>. Study was to come later. The next year, however, 322,
Perdiccas of Thrace made an attack on Samos and drove out the Athenian
<a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="green">p. 102</font></A> colonists. Neocles had by then lived on his bit of land for thirty
years, and was old to begin life again. The ruined family took refuge in
Colophon, and there Epicurus joined them. They were now too poor for the
boy to go abroad to study philosophy. He could only make the best of a
hard time and puzzle alone over the problems of life.</p>

<p>Recent years have taught us that there are few forms of misery harder
than that endured by a family of refugees, and it is not likely to have
been easier in ancient conditions. Epicurus built up his philosophy, it
would seem, while helping his parents and brothers through this bad
time. The problem was how to make the life of their little colony
tolerable, and he somehow solved it. It was not the kind of problem
which Stoicism and the great religions specially set themselves; it was
at once too unpretending and too practical. One can easily imagine the
condition for which he had to prescribe. For one thing, the unfortunate
refugees all about him would torment themselves with unnecessary
terrors. The Thracians were pursuing them. The Gods hated them; they
must obviously have committed some offence or impiety. (It is always
easy for disheartened men to discover in themselves some sin that
deserves punishment.) It would surely be better to die at once; except
that, with that sin upon them, they would only suffer more dreadfully
beyond the grave! In their distress they jarred, doubtless, on one
another's nerves; and mutual bitterness doubled their miseries.</p>

<p>Epicurus is said to have had poor health, and the situation was one
where even the best health would be sorely tried. But he had superhuman
courage, and&mdash;what <a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="green">p. 103</font></A> does not always go with such courage&mdash;a very
affectionate and gentle nature. In later life all his three brothers
were his devoted disciples&mdash;a testimonial accorded to few prophets or
founders of religions. And he is the first man in the record of European
history whose mother was an important element in his life. Some of his
letters to her have been preserved, and show a touch of intimate
affection which of course must have existed between human beings from
the remotest times, but of which we possess no earlier record. And
fragments of his letters to his friends strike the same note.<A NAME="an_fr_103_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_103_1">103_1</A></p>

<p>His first discovery was that men torture themselves with unnecessary
fears. He must teach them courage, <ins class="greek" title="tharrein apo t&ocirc;n the&ocirc;n, tharrein apo
anthr&ocirc;p&ocirc;n">&#952;&#945;&#961;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#7936;&#961;&#8056; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#952;&#949;&#8182;&#957;, &#952;&#945;&#961;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#7936;&#961;&#8056; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#969;&#957;</ins>, to fear no evil from either man or God. God is a blessed
being; and no blessed being either suffers evil or inflicts evil on
others. And as for men, most of the evils you fear from them can be
avoided by Justice; and if they do come, they can be borne. Death is
like sleep, an unconscious state, nowise to be feared. Pain when it
comes can be endured; it is the anticipation that makes men miserable
and saps their courage. The refugees were forgotten by the world, and
had no hope of any great <a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="green">p. 104</font></A> change in their condition. Well, he argued, so
much the better! Let them till the earth and love one another, and they
would find that they had already in them that Natural Happiness which is
man's possession until he throws it away. And of all things that
contribute to happiness the greatest is Affection, <ins class="greek" title="philia">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#8055;&#945;</ins>.</p>

<p>Like the Cynics and Stoics, he rejected the world and all its
conventions and prizes, its desires and passions and futility. But where
the Stoic and Cynic proclaimed that in spite of all the pain and
suffering of a wicked world, man can by the force of his own will be
virtuous, Epicurus brought the more surprising good news that man can
after all be happy.</p>

<p>But to make this good news credible he had to construct a system of
thought. He had to answer the temple authorities and their adherents
among the vulgar, who threatened his followers with the torments of
Hades for their impiety. He had to answer the Stoics and Cynics,
preaching that all is worthless except Aret&ecirc;; and the Sceptics, who
dwelt on the fallibility of the senses, and the logical impossibility of
knowledge.</p>

<p>He met the last of these by the traditional Ionian doctrine of
sense-impressions, ingeniously developed. We can, he argued, know the
outer world, because our sense impressions are literally 'impressions'
or stamps made by external objects upon our organs. To see, for
instance, is to be struck by an infinitely tenuous stream of images,
flowing from the object and directly impinging upon the retina. Such
streams are flowing from all objects in every direction&mdash;an idea which
seemed incredible until the modern discoveries about light, sound, and
radiation. Thus there is direct contact with reality, and consequently
knowledge. Besides <a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="green">p. 105</font></A> direct vision, however, we have 'anticipations', or
<ins class="greek" title="prol&ecirc;pseis">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#955;&#8053;&#968;&#949;&#953;&#962;</ins>, sometimes called 'common conceptions', e. g. the general
conception which we have of a horse when we are not seeing one. These
are merely the result of repeated acts of vision. A curious result of
this doctrine was that all our 'anticipations' or 'common ideas' are
true; mistakes occur through some interpretation of our own which we add
to the simple sensation.</p>

<p>We can know the world. How then are we to understand it? Here again
Epicurus found refuge in the old Ionian theory of Atoms and the Void,
which is supposed to have originated with Democritus and Leucippus, a
century before. But Epicurus seems to have worked out the Atomic Theory
more in detail, as we have it expounded in Lucretius' magnificent poem.
In particular it was possibly he who first combined the Atomic Theory
with hylozoism; i. e. he conceived of the Atoms as possessing some
rudimentary power of movement and therefore able to swerve slightly in
their regular downward course. That explains how they have become
infinitely tangled and mingled, how plants and animals are alive, and
how men have Free Will. It also enables Epicurus to build up a world
without the assistance of a god. He set man free, as Lucretius says,
from the 'burden of Religion', though his doctrine of the 'blessed
Being' which neither has pain nor gives pain, enables him to elude the
dangerous accusation of atheism. He can leave people believing in all
their traditional gods, including even, if so they wish, 'the bearded
Zeus and the helmed Athena' which they see in dreams and in their
'common ideas', while at the same time having no fear of them.</p>

<p><a name="page_106"><font size="1" color="green">p. 106</font></A> </p><p>There remains the foolish fancy of the Cynics and Stoics that 'Aret&ecirc;'
is the only good. Of course, he answers, Aret&ecirc; is good; but that is
because it produces happy life, or blessedness or pleasure or whatever
you call it. He used normally the word <ins class="greek" title="h&ecirc;don&ecirc;">&#7969;&#948;&#959;&#957;&#8053;</ins> 'sweetness', and counted
the Good as that which makes life sweet. He seems never to have entered
into small disputes as to the difference between 'sweetness', or
'pleasure', and 'happiness' and 'well-being' (<ins class="greek" title="h&ecirc;don&ecirc;">&#7969;&#948;&#959;&#957;&#8053;</ins>, <ins class="greek" title="eudaimonia">&#949;&#8016;&#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#8055;&#945;</ins>,
<ins class="greek" title="euest&ocirc;, ktl.">&#949;&#8016;&#949;&#963;&#964;&#8061;, &#954;&#964;&#955;.</ins>), though sometimes, instead of 'sweetness' he spoke of
'blessedness' (<ins class="greek" title="makariot&ecirc;s">&#956;&#945;&#954;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#8057;&#964;&#951;&#962;</ins>). Ultimately the dispute between him and the
Stoics seems to resolve itself into a question whether the Good lies in
<ins class="greek" title="paschein">&#960;&#8049;&#963;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;</ins> or <ins class="greek" title="poiein">&#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</ins>, in Experience or in Action; and average human
beings seem generally to think that the Good for a conscious being must
be something of which he is conscious.</p>

<p>Thus the great system is built, simple, intelligible, dogmatic, and&mdash;as
such systems go&mdash;remarkably water-tight. It enables man to be unafraid,
and it helps him to be happy. The strange thing is that, although on
more than one point it seems to anticipate most surprisingly the
discoveries of modern science, it was accepted in a spirit more
religious than scientific. As we can see from Lucretius it was taken
almost as a revelation, from one who had saved mankind; whose intellect
had pierced beyond the 'flaming walls of Heaven' and brought back to man
the gospel of an intelligible universe.<A NAME="an_fr_106_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_106_1">106_1</A></p>

<p><a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="green">p. 107</font></A> </p><p>In 310 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, when Epicurus was thirty-two, things had so far improved
that he left Colophon and set up a school of philosophy in Mytilene, but
soon moved to Lampsacus, on the Sea of Marmora, where he had friends.
Disciples gathered about him. Among them were some of the leading men of
the city, like Leonteus and Idomeneus. The doctrine thrilled them and
seemed to bring freedom with it. They felt that such a teacher must be
set up in Athens, the home of the great philosophers. They bought by
subscription a house and garden in Athens for 80 minae (about
&pound;320)<A NAME="an_fr_107_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_107_1">107_1</A> and presented it to the Master. He crossed to Athens in 306
and, though he four times revisited Lampsacus and has left letters
addressed <i>To Friends in Lampsacus</i>, he lived in the famous Garden for
the rest of his life.</p>

<p>Friends from Lampsacus and elsewhere came and lived with him or near
him. The Garden was not only <a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="green">p. 108</font></A> a philosophical school; it was also a sort
of retreat or religious community. There lived there not only
philosophers like M&ecirc;trod&ocirc;rus, Col&ocirc;tes, Hermarchus, and others; there
were slaves, like Mys, and free women, like Themista, the wife of
Leonteus, to both of whom the Master, as the extant fragments testify,
wrote letters of intimate friendship. And not only free women, but women
with names that show that they were slaves, Leontion, Nikidion,
Mammarion. They were <i>hetairae</i>; perhaps victims of war, like many of
the unfortunate heroines in the New Comedy; free women from conquered
cities, who had been sold in the slave market or reduced to misery as
refugees, and to whom now the Garden afforded a true and spiritual
refuge. For, almost as much as Diogenes, Epicurus had obliterated the
stamp on the conventional currency. The values of the world no longer
held good after you had passed the wicket gate of the Garden, and spoken
with the Deliverer.</p>

<p>The Epicureans lived simply. They took neither flesh nor wine, and there
is a letter extant, asking some one to send them a present of 'potted
cheese'<A NAME="an_fr_108_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_108_1">108_1</A> as a special luxury. Their enemies, who were numerous and
lively, make the obvious accusations about the hetairae, and cite an
alleged letter of the Master to Leontion. 'Lord Paean, my dear little
Leontion, your note fills me with such a bubble of excitement!'<A NAME="an_fr_108_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_108_2">108_2</A>
The problem of this letter well illustrates the difficulty <a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="green">p. 109</font></A> of forming
clear judgements about the details of ancient life. Probably the letter
is a forgery: we are definitely informed that there was a collection of
such forgeries, made in order to damage Epicurus. But, if genuine, would
it have seemed to a fair-minded contemporary a permissible or an
impermissible letter for a philosopher to write? By modern standards it
would be about the border-line. And again, suppose it is a definite
love-letter, what means have we of deciding whether Epicurus&mdash;or for
that matter Zeno or Plato or any unconventional philosopher of this
period&mdash;would have thought it blameworthy, or would merely have called
our attention to the legal difficulties of contracting marriage with one
who had been a Hetaira, and asked us how we expect men and women to
live. Curiously enough, we happen to have the recorded sayings of
Epicurus himself: 'The wise man will not fall in love', and 'Physical
union of the sexes never did good; it is much if it does not do harm.'</p>

<p>This philosophy is often unjustly criticized. It is called selfish; but
that it is certainly not. It is always aiming at the deliverance of
mankind<A NAME="an_fr_109_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_109_1">109_1</A> and it bases its happiness on <ins class="greek" title="philia">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#8055;&#945;</ins>, Friendship or
Affection, just as the early Christians based it on <ins class="greek" title="agap&ecirc;">&#7936;&#947;&#8049;&#960;&#951;</ins>, a word no
whit stronger than <ins class="greek" title="philia">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#8055;&#945;</ins>, though it is conventionally translated
'Love'. By this conception it becomes at once more human than the Stoa,
to which, as to a Christian monk, human affection was merely a weakness
of the flesh which might often conflict with the soul's duty towards
God. Epicurus passionately protested against this unnatural 'apathy'. It
was also human in that it recognized degrees of good or bad, of virtue
or error. <a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="green">p. 110</font></A> To the Stoic that which was not right was wrong. A calculator
who says that seven sevens make forty-eight is just as wrong as one who
says they make a thousand, and a sailor one inch below the surface of
the water drowns just as surely as one who is a furlong deep. Just so in
human life, wrong is wrong, falsehood is falsehood, and to talk of
degrees is childish. Epicureanism had an easy and natural answer to
these arguments, since pleasure and pain obviously admit of
degrees.<A NAME="an_fr_110_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_110_1">110_1</A></p>

<p>The school is blamed also for pursuing pleasure, on the ground that the
direct pursuit of pleasure is self-defeating. But Epicurus never makes
that mistake. He says that pleasure, or 'sweetness of life', is the
good; but he never counsels the direct pursuit of it. Quite the reverse.
He says that if you conquer your desires and fears, and live simply and
love those about you, the natural sweetness of life will reveal itself.</p>

<p>A truer criticism is one which appears dimly in Plutarch and
Cicero.<A NAME="an_fr_110_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_110_2">110_2</A> There is a strange shadow of sadness hanging over this
wise and kindly faith, which proceeds from the essential distrust of
life that lies at its heart. The best that Epicurus has really to say of
the world is that if you are very wise and do not attract its
notice&mdash;<ins class="greek" title="Lathe bi&ocirc;sas">&#923;&#8049;&#952;&#949; &#946;&#953;&#8061;&#963;&#945;&#962;</ins>&mdash;it will not hurt you. It is a philosophy not of
conquest but of escape. This was a weakness from which few of the
fourth-century thinkers completely escaped. To aim at what we should
call positive happiness was, to the Epicureans, only to court
disappointment; better make it your aim <a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="green">p. 111</font></A> to live without strong passion
or desire, without high hopes or ambitions. Their professed
ideals&mdash;<ins class="greek" title="pantos tou algountos hypexairesis">&#960;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7936;&#955;&#947;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962; &#8017;&#960;&#949;&#958;&#945;&#8055;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;</ins>, <ins class="greek" title="ataraxia">&#7936;&#964;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#958;&#8055;&#945;</ins>, <ins class="greek" title="heuroia">&#949;&#8021;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#945;</ins>, 'the
removal of all active suffering', 'undisturbedness', 'a smooth
flow'&mdash;seem to result in rather a low tension, in a life that is only
half alive. We know that, as a matter of fact, this was not so. The
Epicureans felt their doctrine to bring not mere comfort but inspiration
and blessedness. The young Colotes, on first hearing the master speak,
fell on his knees with tears and hailed him as a god.<A NAME="an_fr_111_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_111_1">111_1</A> We may
compare the rapturous phrases of Lucretius. What can be the explanation
of this?</p>

<p>Perhaps it is that a deep distrust of the world produces its own inward
reaction, as starving men dream of rich banquets, and persecuted sects
have apocalyptic visions of paradise. The hopes and desires that are
starved of their natural sustenance project themselves on to some plane
of the imagination. The martyr, even the most heretical martyr, sees the
vision of his crown in the skies, the lover sees in obvious defects only
rare and esoteric beauties. Epicurus avoided sedulously the
transcendental optimism of the Stoics. He avoided mysticism, avoided
allegory, avoided faith; he tried to set the feet of his philosophy on
solid ground. He can make a strong case for the probable happiness of a
man of kindly affections and few desires, who asks little from the
outside world. But after all it is only probable; misfortunes and
miseries may come to any man. 'Most of the evils you fear are false,' he
answers, still reasonably. 'Death does not hurt. <a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="green">p. 112</font></A> Poverty need never
make a man less happy.' And actual pain? 'Yes, pain may come. But you
can endure it. Intense pains are brief; long-drawn pains are not
excruciating; or seldom so.' Is that common-sense comfort not enough?
The doctrine becomes more intense both in its promises and its demands.
If intense suffering comes, he enjoins, turn away your mind and conquer
the pain by the 'sweetness' of memory. There are in every wise man's
life moments of intense beauty and delight; if he has strength of mind
he will call them back to him at will and live in the blessedness of the
past, not in the mere dull agony of the moment. Nay, can he not actually
enjoy the intellectual interest of this or that pang? Has he not that
within him which can make the quality of its own life? On hearing of the
death of a friend he will call back the sweetness of that friend's
converse; in the burning Bull of Phalaris he will think his thoughts and
be glad. Illusion, the old Siren with whom man cannot live in peace, nor
yet without her, has crept back unseen to the centre of the citadel. It
was Epicurus, and not a Stoic or Cynic, who asserts that a Wise Man will
be happy on the rack.<A NAME="an_fr_112_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_112_1">112_1</A></p>

<p>Strangely obliging, ironic Fortune gave to him also a chance of testing
of his own doctrine. There is extant a letter written on his death-bed.
'I write to you on this blissful day which is the last of my life. The
obstruction of my bladder and internal pains have reached the extreme
point, but there is marshalled against them the delight of my mind in
thinking over our talks together. Take care of the children of
Metrodorus in a way worthy of your life-long devotion <a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="green">p. 113</font></A> to me and to
philosophy.'<A NAME="an_fr_113_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_113_1">113_1</A> At least his courage, and his kindness, did not
fail.</p>

<p>Epicureanism had certainly its sublime side; and from this very
sublimity perhaps arose the greatest flaw in the system, regarded as a
rational philosophy. It was accepted too much as a Revelation, too
little as a mere step in the search for truth. It was based no doubt on
careful and even profound scientific studies, and was expounded by the
master in a vast array of volumes. But the result so attained was
considered sufficient. Further research was not encouraged. Heterodoxy
was condemned as something almost approaching 'parricide'.<A NAME="an_fr_113_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_113_2">113_2</A> The
pursuit of 'needless knowledge' was deliberately frowned upon.<A NAME="an_fr_113_3"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_113_3">113_3</A>
When other philosophers were working out calculations about the size of
the Sun and the commensurability of the sun-cycle and the moon-cycle,
Epicurus contemptuously remarked that the Sun was probably about as big
as it looked, or perhaps smaller: since fires at a distance generally
look bigger than they are. The various theories of learned men were all
possible but none certain. And as for the cycles, how did any one know
that there was not a new sun shot off and extinguished every day?<A NAME="an_fr_113_4"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_113_4">113_4</A>
It is not surprising to find that none of <a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="green">p. 114</font></A> the great discoveries of the
Hellenistic Age were due to the Epicurean school. Lucretius, writing 250
years later, appears to vary hardly in any detail from the doctrines of
the Master, and Diogenes of Oenoanda, 500 years later, actually repeats
his letters and sayings word for word.</p>

<p>It is sad, this. It is un-Hellenic; it is a clear symptom of decadence
from the free intellectual movement and the high hopes which had made
the fifth century glorious. Only in one great school does the true
Hellenic <i>S&ocirc;phrosyn&ecirc;</i> continue flourishing, a school whose modesty of
pretension and quietness of language form a curious contrast with the
rapt ecstasies of Stoic and Cynic and even, as we have seen, of
Epicurean, just as its immense richness of scientific achievement
contrasts with their comparative sterility. The Porch and the Garden
offered new religions to raise from the dust men and women whose spirits
were broken; Aristotle in his Open Walk, or <i>Peripatos</i>, brought
philosophy and science and literature to guide the feet and interest the
minds of those who still saw life steadily and tried their best to see
it whole.</p>

<p>Aristotle was not lacking in religious insight and imagination, as he
certainly was not without profound influence on the future history of
religion. His complete rejection of mythology and of anthropomorphism;
his resolute attempt to combine religion and science, not by sacrificing
one to the other but by building the highest spiritual aspirations on
ascertained truth and the probable conclusions to which it pointed; his
splendid imaginative conception of the Divine Being or First Cause as
unmoved itself while moving all the universe 'as the beloved moves the
lover'; all these <a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="green">p. 115</font></A> are high services to religious speculation, and
justify the position he held, even when known only through a distorting
Arabic translation, in medieval Christianity. If he had not written his
other books he might well be famous now as a great religious teacher.
But his theology is dwarfed by the magnificence and mass of his other
work. And as a philosopher and man of science he does not belong to our
present subject.</p>

<p>He is only mentioned here as a standard of that characteristic quality
in Hellenism from which the rest of this book records a downfall. One
variant of a well-known story tells how a certain philosopher, after
frequenting the Peripatetic School, went to hear Chrysippus, the Stoic,
and was transfixed. 'It was like turning from men to Gods.' It was
really turning from Greeks to Semites, from philosophy to religion, from
a school of very sober professions and high performance to one whose
professions dazzled the reason. 'Come unto me,' cried the Stoic, 'all ye
who are in storm or delusion; I will show you the truth and the world
will never grieve you more.'</p>

<p>Aristotle made no such profession. He merely thought and worked and
taught better than other men. Aristotle is always surprising us not
merely by the immense volume of clear thinking and co-ordinated
knowledge of which he was master, but by the steady <i>S&ocirc;phrosyn&ecirc;</i> of his
temper. Son of the court physician of Philip, tutor for some years to
Alexander the Great, he never throughout his extant writings utters one
syllable of flattery to his royal and world-conquering employers; nor
yet one syllable which suggests a grievance. He saw, at close quarters
and from the winning side, the conquest of the Greek city states by <a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="green">p. 116</font></A> the
Macedonian <i>ethnos</i> or nation; but he judges dispassionately that the
city is the higher social form.</p>

<p>It seems characteristic that in his will, which is extant, after
providing a dowry for his widow, Herpyllis, to facilitate her getting a
second husband, and thanking her for her goodness to him, he directs
that his bones are to be laid in the same grave with those of his first
wife, Pythias, whom he had rescued from robbers more than twenty years
before.<A NAME="an_fr_116_1"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_116_1">116_1</A></p>

<p>Other philosophers disliked him because he wore no long beard, dressed
neatly and had good normal manners, and they despised his philosophy for
very similar reasons. It was a school which took the existing world and
tried to understand it instead of inventing some intense ecstatic
doctrine which should transform it or reduce it to nothingness.</p>

<p>It possessed no Open Sesame to unlock the prison of mankind; yet it is
not haunted by that <i>Oim&ocirc;g&ecirc;</i> of Kynoskephalai. While armies sweep Greece
this way and that, while the old gods are vanquished and the cities lose
their freedom and their meaning, the Peripatetics instead of
passionately saving souls diligently pursued knowledge, and in
generation after generation produced scientific results which put all
their rivals into the shade.<A NAME="an_fr_116_2"></A><A HREF="fsgr07.htm#an_fn_116_2">116_2</A> In mathematics, astronomy, physics,
botany, zoology, and biology, as well <a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="green">p. 117</font></A> as the human sciences of
literature and history, the Hellenistic Age was one of the most creative
known to our record. And it is not only that among the savants
responsible for these advances the proportion of Peripatetics is
overwhelming; one may also notice that in this school alone it is
assumed as natural that further research will take place and will
probably correct as well as increase our knowledge, and that, when such
corrections or differences of opinion do take place, there is no cry
raised of Heresy.</p>

<p>It is the old difference between Philosophy and Religion, between the
search of the intellect for truth and the cry of the heart for
salvation. As the interest in truth for its own sake gradually abated in
the ancient world, the works of Aristotle might still find commentators,
but his example was forgotten and his influence confined to a small
circle. The Porch and the Garden, for the most part, divided between
them the allegiance of thoughtful men. Both systems had begun in days of
discomfiture, and aimed originally more at providing a refuge for the
soul than at ordering the course of society. But after the turmoil of
the fourth century had subsided, when governments began again to
approach more nearly to peace and consequently to justice, and public
life once more to be attractive to decent men, both philosophies showed
themselves adaptable to the needs of prosperity as well as adversity.
Many kings and great Roman governors professed Stoicism. It held before
them the ideal of universal Brotherhood, and of duty to the 'Great
Society of Gods and Men'; it enabled them to work, indifferent to mere
pain and pleasure, as servants of the divine purpose and 'fellow-workers
with God' in building up <a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="green">p. 118</font></A> a human Cosmos within the eternal Cosmos. It
is perhaps at first sight strange that many kings and governors also
followed Epicurus. Yet after all the work of a public man is not
hindered by a slight irony as to the value of worldly greatness and a
conviction that a dinner of bread and water with love to season it 'is
better than all the crowns of the Greeks'. To hate cruelty and
superstition, to avoid passion and luxury, to regard human 'pleasure' or
'sweetness of life' as the goal to be aimed at, and 'friendship' or
'kindliness' as the principal element in that pleasure, are by no means
doctrines incompatible with wise and effective administration. Both
systems were good and both in a way complementary one to another. They
still divide between them the practical philosophy of western mankind.
At times to most of us it seems as though nothing in life had value
except to do right and to fear not; at others that the only true aim is
to make mankind happy. At times man's best hope seems to lie in that
part of him which is prepared to defy or condemn the world of fact if it
diverges from the ideal; in that intensity of reverence which will
accept many impossibilities rather than ever reject a holy thing; above
all in that uncompromising moral sensitiveness to which not merely the
corruptions of society but the fundamental and necessary facts of animal
existence seem both nauseous and wicked, links and chains in a system
which can never be the true home of the human spirit. At other times men
feel the need to adapt their beliefs and actions to the world as it is;
to brush themselves free from cobwebs; to face plain facts with common
sense and as much kindliness as life permits, meeting the ordinary needs
of a perishable <a name="page_119"><font size="1" color="green">p. 119</font></A> and imperfect species without illusion and without
make-believe. At one time we are Stoics, at another Epicureans.</p>

<p>But amid their differences there is one faith which was held by both
schools in common. It is the great characteristic faith of the ancient
world, revealing itself in many divergent guises and seldom fully
intelligible to modern men; faith in the absolute supremacy of the
inward life over things external. These men really believed that wisdom
is more precious than jewels, that poverty and ill health are things of
no import, that the good man is happy whatever befall him, and all the
rest. And in generation after generation many of the ablest men, and
women also, acted upon the belief. They lived by free choice lives whose
simplicity and privation would horrify a modern labourer, and the world
about them seems to have respected rather than despised their poverty.
To the Middle Age, with its monks and mendicants expectant of reward in
heaven, such an attitude, except for its disinterestedness, would be
easily understood. To some eastern nations, with their cults of
asceticism and contemplation, the same doctrines have appealed almost
like a physical passion or a dangerous drug running riot in their veins.
But modern western man cannot believe them, nor believe seriously that
others believe them. On us the power of the material world has, through
our very mastery of it and the dependence which results from that
mastery, both inwardly and outwardly increased its hold. <i>Capta ferum
victorem cepit.</i> We have taken possession of it, and now we cannot move
without it.</p>

<p>The material element in modern life is far greater <a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="green">p. 120</font></A> than in ancient; but
it does not follow that the spiritual element is correspondingly less.
No doubt it is true that a naval officer in a conning-tower in a modern
battle does not need less courage and character than a naked savage who
meets his enemy with a stick and a spear. Yet probably in the first case
the battle is mainly decided by the weight and accuracy of the guns, in
the second by the qualities of the fighter. Consequently the modern
world thinks more incessantly and anxiously about the guns, that is,
about money and mechanism; the ancient devotes its thought more to human
character and duty. And it is curious to observe how, in general, each
tries to remedy what is wrong with the world by the method that is
habitually in its thoughts. Speaking broadly, apart from certain
religious movements, the enlightened modern reformer, if confronted with
some ordinary complex of misery and wickedness, instinctively proposes
to cure it by higher wages, better food, more comfort and leisure; to
make people comfortable and trust to their becoming good. The typical
ancient reformer would appeal to us to care for none of those things
(since riches notoriously do not make men virtuous), but with all our
powers to pursue wisdom or righteousness and the life of the spirit; to
be good men, as we can be if we will, and to know that all else will
follow.</p>

<p>This is one of the regions in which the ancients might have learned much
from us, and in which we still have much to learn from them, if once we
can shake off our temporal obsessions and listen.</p>


<h4><A NAME="an_Dicaearchus"></A>NOTE</h4>

<p>As an example it is worth noticing, even in a bare catalogue, the work
done by one of Aristotle's own pupils, a Peripatetic <a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="green">p. 121</font></A> of the second
rank, Dicaearchus of Messene. His <i>floruit</i> is given as 310 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> Dorian
by birth, when Theophrastus was made head of the school he retired to
the Peloponnese, and shows a certain prejudice against Athens.</p>

<p>One of the discoveries of the time was biography. And, by a brilliant
stroke of imagination Dicaearchus termed one of his books <ins class="greek" title="Bios
Hellados">&#914;&#8055;&#959;&#962; &#7961;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#948;&#959;&#962;</ins>, <i>The Life of Hellas</i>. He saw civilization as the biography of
the world. First, the Age of Cronos, when man as a simple savage made no
effort after higher things; next, the ancient river-civilizations of the
orient; third, the Hellenic system. Among his scanty fragments we find
notes on such ideas as <ins class="greek" title="patra">&#960;&#8049;&#964;&#961;&#945;</ins>, <ins class="greek" title="phratria">&#966;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#8055;&#945;</ins>, <ins class="greek" title="phyl&ecirc;">&#966;&#965;&#955;&#8053;</ins>, as Greek institutions.
The <i>Life of Hellas</i> was much used by late writers. It formed the model
for another <ins class="greek" title="Bios Hellados">&#914;&#8055;&#959;&#962; &#7961;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#948;&#959;&#962;</ins> by a certain Jason, and for Varro's <i>Vita
Populi Romani</i>.</p>

<p>Then, like his great master, Dicaearchus made studies of the
Constitutions of various states (e. g. Pellene, Athens, and Corinth);
his treatise on the Constitution of Sparta was read aloud annually in
that city by order of the Ephors. It was evidently appreciative.</p>

<p>A more speculative work was his <i>Tripoliticus</i>, arguing that the best
constitution ought to be compounded of the three species, monarchic,
aristocratic, and democratic, as in Sparta. Only then would it be sure
to last. Polybius accepted the principle of the Mixed Constitution, but
found his ideal in the constitution of Rome, which later history was to
prove so violently unstable. Cicero, <i>De Republica</i>, takes the same line
(Polyb. vi. 2-10; Cic. <i>De Rep.</i> i. 45; ii. 65). Dicaearchus treated of
similar political subjects in his public addresses at Olympia and at the
Panathenaea.</p>

<p>We hear more about his work on the history of literature, though his
generation was almost the first to realize that such a subject had any
existence. He wrote <i>Lives of Philosophers</i>&mdash;a subject hitherto not
considered worth recording&mdash;giving the biographical facts followed by
philosophic and aesthetic criticism. We hear, for example, of his life
of Plato; of Pythagoras (in which he laid emphasis on the philosopher's
practical work), of Xenophanes, and of the Seven Wise Men.</p>

<p>He also wrote <i>Lives of Poets</i>. We hear of books on Alcaeus and on
Homer, in which latter he is said to have made the startling remark that
the poems 'should be pronounced in the Aeolic dialect'. Whatever this
remark exactly meant, and we cannot tell without the context, it seems
an extraordinary anticipation of modern philological discoveries. He
wrote on the <i>Hypotheses</i>&mdash;i. e. the subject matter&mdash;<i>of Sophocles and
Euripides</i>; also on <i>Musical Contests</i>, <ins class="greek" title="peri Mousik&ocirc;n ag&ocirc;n&ocirc;n">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#924;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#957; &#7936;&#947;&#8061;&#957;&#969;&#957;</ins>, carrying
further Aristotle's own collection of the <i>Didascaliae</i>, or official
notices of the production of Tragedies in Athens. The book dealt both
with dates and with customs; <a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="green">p. 122</font></A> it told how Skolia were sung, with a
laurel or myrtle twig in the hand, how Sophocles introduced a third
actor, and the like.</p>

<p>In philosophy proper he wrote On the Soul, <ins class="greek" title="peri psych&ecirc;s">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#968;&#965;&#967;&#8134;&#962;</ins>. His first
book, the <i>Corinthiacus</i>, proved that the Soul was a 'harmony' or 'right
blending' of the four elements, and was identical with the force of the
living body. The second, the <i>Lesbiacus</i>, drew the conclusion that, if a
compound, it was destructible. (Hence a great controversy with his
master.)</p>

<p>He wrote <ins class="greek" title="peri phthoras anthr&ocirc;p&ocirc;n">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#966;&#952;&#959;&#961;&#8118;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#969;&#957;</ins>, on the <i>Perishing of Mankind</i>; i. e.
on the way in which large masses of men have perished off the earth,
through famine, pestilence, wild beasts, war, and the like. He decides
that man's most destructive enemy is Man. (The subject may have been
suggested to him by a fine imaginative passage in Aristotle's
<i>Meteorology</i> (i. 14, 7) dealing with the vast changes that have taken
place on the earth's surface and the unrecorded perishings of races and
communities.)</p>

<p>He wrote a treatise against <i>Divination</i>, and a (satirical?) <i>Descent to
the Cave of Trophonius</i>. He seems, however, to have allowed some
importance to dreams and to the phenomena of 'possession'.</p>

<p>And, with all this, we have not touched on his greatest work, which was
in the sphere of geography. He wrote a <ins class="greek" title="Periodos g&ecirc;s">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8055;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#962; &#947;&#8134;&#962;</ins>, a <i>Journey Round
the Earth</i>, accompanied with a map. He used for this map the greatly
increased stores of knowledge gained by the Macedonian expeditions over
all Asia as far as the Ganges. He also seems to have devised the method
of denoting the position of a place by means of two co-ordinates, the
method soon after developed by Eratosthenes into Latitude and Longitude.
He attempted calculations of the measurements of large geographic
distances, for which of course both his data and his instruments were
inadequate. Nevertheless his measurements remained a well-known
standard; we find them quoted and criticized by Strabo and Polybius.
And, lastly, he published <i>Measurements of the Heights of Mountains in
the Peloponnese</i>; but the title seems to have been unduly modest, for we
find in the fragments statements about mountains far outside that area;
about Pelion and Olympus in Thessaly and of Atabyrion in Rhodes. He had
a subvention, Pliny tells us (N. H. ii. 162, 'regum cura permensus
montes'), from the king of Macedon, probably either Cassander or, as one
would like to believe, the philosophic Antigonus Gonatas. And he
calculated the heights, so we are told, by trigonometry, using the
<ins class="greek" title="dioptra">&#948;&#8055;&#959;&#960;&#964;&#961;&#945;</ins>, an instrument of hollow reeds without lenses which served for
his primitive theodolite. It is an extraordinary record, and illustrates
the true Peripatetic spirit.</p>

captured Metrocles' sister, Hipparchia. She loved Crates, his words, and
his way of life, and paid no attention to any of her suitors, however
rich or highborn or handsome. Crates was everything to her. She
threatened her parents that she would commit suicide unless she were
given to him. They asked Crates to try to change the girl's mind, and he
did all he could to no effect, till at last he put all his possessions
on the floor and stood up in front of her. 'Here is your bridegroom;
there is his fortune; now think!' The girl made her choice, put on the
beggar's garb, and went her ways with Crates. She lived with him openly
and went like him to beg food at dinners.' Diog. Laert. vi. 96 ff.</p></div>

Thus, Man has learnt to stand on two feet and use his hands; a great
advantage but one which has led to numerous diseases. Again,
physiologists say that the increasing size of the human head, especially
when combined with the diminishing size of the pelvis, tends to make
normal birth impossible.</p></div>

indignation against that inhuman superiority to natural sorrows which is
so much prized by most of the ancient schools. To him such 'apathy'
argues either a hard heart or a morbid vanity (Fr. 120). His letters are
full of affectionate expressions which rather shock the stern reserve of
antique philosophy. He waits for one friend's 'heavenly presence' (Fr.
165). He 'melts with a peculiar joy mingled with tears in remembering
the last words' of one who is dead (Fr. 186; cf. 213). He is
enthusiastic about an act of kindness performed by another, who walked
some five miles to help a barbarian prisoner (Fr. 194).</p></div>
