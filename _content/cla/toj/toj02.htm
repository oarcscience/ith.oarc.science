<P>The Sun's resplendent deity I sing,<BR>
The beauteous offspring of almighty Jove,<BR>
Who, thro' the vivifying solar fount<BR>
Within his fabricative mind conceal'd,<BR>
A triad form'd of splendid solar gods;<BR>
From whence the world's all-various forms emerg'd<BR>
From mystic darkness into beauteous light,<BR>
Perfect, and full of intellectual goods.<BR>
Hail! Supermundane king of light divine,<BR>
And fairest image of the unknown good:<BR>
For, as the light proceeding from <I>the one</I>,<BR>
The god of gods, and beauty's matchless flower,<BR>
Intelligibles, with deific rays<BR>
Occult, illumes; so from Apollo's beams<BR>
Exulting glorious through harmonic power,<BR>
The mental world with elevating light<BR>
Is fill'd exub'rant: and th' apparent Sun<BR>
Largely diffuses thro' the world of sense,<BR>
Light, all-prolific, beautiful, divine.<BR>
To thee, as bright Apollo, it belongs<BR>
All multitude in union to collect,<BR>
And many natures generate from one;<BR>
With vigour in thy essence to convolve<BR>
The diff'rent ranks of secondary forms;<BR>
And thro' one fair hyparxis&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> to combine</P></DIR>

<P>All-various essences and fertile powers.<BR>
'Tis thine, from multitude exempt, t' inspire<BR>
In forms subordinate, prophetic truth;<BR>
For <I>truth</I> and <I>pure simplicity</I> are one:<BR>
And of preserving unpolluted power,<BR>
Thy <I>liberated</I> essence is the source.<BR>
Fam'd mystic bards of old, in sacred song,<BR>
By thee inspir'd, as th' <I>arrow-darting</I> god,<BR>
Constant invok'd thee, with resistless sway,<BR>
Because thy vig'rous beams like arrows pierce,<BR>
And totally, whate'er of measure void the world<BR>
Inordinate or dark contains, destroy.<BR>
And last, thy revolution is the sign<BR>
Of motion, harmonizing into one<BR>
The various natures of this mighty whole.<BR>
Thy <I>first</I> bright <I>Monad</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> hence, illustrious god,<BR>
Enunciates truth and intellectual light;<BR>
That light, which in the essence of the gods,<BR>
Subsists with rays uniting and unknown.<BR>
Thy <I>second</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, ev'ry thing confus'd destroys:<BR>
And from thy <I>third</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_20"></A><A HREF="#fn_20"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, the universe is bound<BR>
In beauteous symmetry and just consent,<BR>
Thro' splendid reasons and harmonic power.<BR>
Add, that thy essence, 'midst the mundane gods,<BR>
A super-mundane order is assign'd;<BR>
An unbegotten and supreme command<BR>
O'er all the ranks of generated forms;<BR>
And In the ever-flowing realms of sense,<BR>
An intellectual dignity of sway.<BR>
Progression two-fold, hence, to thee belongs,--<BR>
One in conjunction with the mundane gods,<BR>
The other supernat'ral and unknown:<BR>
For when the Demiurgus form'd the world,<BR>
He kindled in the solar sphere a light,<BR>
Unlike the splendour of the other orbs,<BR>
Drawn from his nature's most occult retreats,<BR>
A symbol fair of intellectual forms;<BR>
And openly announcing as it shines<BR>
To ev'ry part of this amazing whole,<BR>
The essence solitary and arcane</P></DIR>

<P>Of all the ruling, supermundane gods.<BR>
Hence too, when first thy beams the world adorn'd<BR>
The mundane gods were ravish'd at the sight;<BR>
And round thy orb, with emulative zeal<BR>
And symphony divine, desir'd to dance,<BR>
And draw abundant from thy fontal light.<BR>
'Tie thine by heat apparent to exalt<BR>
Corporeal natures from the sluggish earth,<BR>
Inspiring vivid, vegetative power;<BR>
And by a nature secretly divine,<BR>
And from the base alloy of matter free,<BR>
Inherent in thy all-productive rays,<BR>
Thou draw'st to union with thy wond'rous form,<BR>
Exalted souls, that In dark Hyle's realms<BR>
Indignant struggle for the courts of. light:<BR>
All beauteous, <I>seven-rayed</I>, supermundane god!<BR>
Whose mystic essence secretly emits<BR>
The splendid fountains of celestial light.<BR>
For 'midst the ruling, super-mundane gods<BR>
A solar world, and total light subsists;<BR>
A light, which as a fertile monad shines<BR>
Superior to the three corporeal worlds.<BR>
By sacred Oracles of old, 'tie said,<BR>
Thy glorious orb beyond the starry sphere<BR>
And in the last etherial world revolves.<BR>
But in thy course, harmoniously divine,<BR>
Thy orb, quadruply intersects these worlds;<BR>
And then twelve powers of radiant gods displays,<BR>
Thro' twelve divisions of the zone oblique.<BR>
And still abundant in productive might,<BR>
Each into three of diff'rent ranks divides.<BR>
Hence, from the fourfold elegance and grace<BR>
Of times and seasons, by thy course produc'd,<BR>
Mankind a triple benefit receive,<BR>
The circling Graces' never-failing gift.<BR>
All-bounteous god, by whom the soul is freed<BR>
Prom Generation's dark corporeal bands,<BR>
Assist THY OFFSPRING, borne on mental wings,<BR>
Beyond the reach of guileful Nature's hands<BR>
Swift to ascend, and gain thy beauteous world.<BR>
The subtle vestment of my soul refine,<BR>
Etherial, firm, and full of sacred light,<BR>
Her ancient vehicle by thee assign'd;<BR>
In which invelop'd, thro' the starry orbs,<BR>
Urg'd' by the Impulse of insane desire,</P></DIR>

<P>She fail'd precipitate, till Lethe's shore,<BR>
Involv'd in night, unhappily she touch'd,<BR>
And lost all knowledge of her pristine state:<BR>
O best of gods, blest d&aelig;mon crown'd with fire,<BR>
My soul's sure refuge in the hour of woe,<BR>
My port paternal in the courts of light,<BR>
Hear, and from punishment my soul absolve,<BR>
The punishment incurr'd by pristine guilt,<BR>
Thro' Lethe's darkness and terrene desire:<BR>
And if for long-extended years I'm doom'd<BR>
In these drear realms Heav'n's exile to remain,<BR>
Oh! grant me soon the necessary means<BR>
To gain that good which solitude confers<BR>
On souls emerging from the bitter waves<BR>
Of fraudful Hyle's black, impetuous flood.<BR>
That thus retiring from the vulgar herd,<BR>
And <I>impious converse of the present age</I>,<BR>
My soul may triumph o'er her natal ills;<BR>
And oft with thee In blissful union join'd<BR>
Thro' energy Ineffable, may soar<BR>
Beyond the highest super-mundane forms;<BR>
And in the vestibule supreme survey,<BR>
Emerging from th' intelligible deep,<BR>
Beauty's transcendent, solitary Sun.</P></DIR>
