<p>Mr Raskin on the absence of fear in the Greek genius. Religion, to writers of the fifth century B.C., mainly a matter of festivals.

Contrast of `g deisidaimon&iacute;a`, fear of spirits.' Plutarch on 'fear of spirits.' Distinction drawn by Isocrates and others between Olympian and apotropaic ritual. Contrast between 'Tendance' (&#0952;&#0949;&#0961;&#0945;&#0960;&#0949;&#0943;&#0945;) and 'Aversion' (&#7936;&#0960;&#0959;&#0964;&#0961;&#0959;&#0960;&#8053;).
