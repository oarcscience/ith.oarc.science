------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sophocles was born about 495 B.C.E. Along with
[Aeschylus](../aesch/index) and [Euripides](../eurip/index) he was one
of the three most prominent ancient Greek tragedians. He wrote over a
hundred plays, of which only seven still survive. The most famous of
these are the 'Theban' or 'Oedipus' cycle. He died in 406 B.C.E.
