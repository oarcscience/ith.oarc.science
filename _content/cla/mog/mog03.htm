<p>Having in the first chapter laid down the principles and premisses according to which we have to proceed, we now enter upon our main subject, a detailed comparison between the centers of Mycenaean civilization and the centers of mythological cycles, and their relative importance. The chief facts of Mycenaean archaeology being well known and easily accessible, this side of our task will need fewer words. It will suffice to recall the main features of the more important finds and sites, for according to our principles there is little place for a discussion of details. What is essential is to comprehend the whole body and the importance of the Mycenaean relics found in certain places. There exist good surveys of this age.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> For our purpose Dr. Fimmen's book is most helpful with its condensed list of Mycenaean find-places and of the authorities on the subject.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> I add solely such things as are of special importance or were discovered after its publication.</p>

<p>The mythological side will need more space and more discussion, for in spite of the many handbooks on mythology,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="mog04.htm#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the mythological materials are not so readily at hand as is the archaeological information. They need to a certain extent to be worked up. It will be necessary to discuss what parts of the myths may with more or less probability be referred to the Mycenaean age and to consider the evidence for this reference, evidence which is often of a rather difficult kind and sometimes, certainly, questionable.</p>
