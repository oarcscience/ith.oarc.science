<p>Oh, are you always going to be bringing some charge against me? No sooner   have I succeeded in rebutting one than you trump up another. I'm sick of this   perpetual bickering. If I happen to run my eye along the topmost tier of the   theatre, you'll be sure to pick one woman out of the crowd</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_44"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 44</FONT></A></p>   
<p>there and make her a pretext for some more nagging. If a woman merely   glances in my direction, and I don't look back at her, my indifference,   you'll say, is all put on; there's something between us right enough. If I   say anything nice about a woman, you immediately start tearing your hair; if   I say anything nasty, well, you say it's just a blind. If I'm looking well,   it's because I leave you alone; and if I'm not, I'm dying of love for someone   else. I shouldn't so much mind if I had really done something. It's easier to   put up with troubles you've brought on yourself; but you upbraid me without   rhyme or reason, and your fatal proclivity for believing the worst about   everybody, weakens whatever effect your fulminations might otherwise have   had. Look at that poor old long-eared donkey there; he doesn't mend his pace,   for all their whackings.</p>   
<p>And now you've got another grievance. It's your smart little maid,   Cypassis, with whom I am supposed to have misconducted myself this time, is   it? And in your bed, too. Now if ever I feel inclined to go astray, the gods   forbid that I should do so with a servant-girl. What man would ever willingly   have relations with a slave or want to fondle a back all covered with weals?   And, mark you, this particular slave is the one that gives the finishing   touches to your hair, whose clever fingers make you look so irresistible; and   I am supposed to go philandering with someone who thinks there's not a woman   like you in the world? Is it likely? I should only get snubbed for my pains,   and she'd tell you all about it. No, I swear by Venus and by the bow of her   wing&egrave;d boy, I'm innocent of the charge you bring against me.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="9%">
