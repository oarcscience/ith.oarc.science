<p>AS my wife was born at fruitful Falisci, we went to visit those walls   which long ago were conquered, Camillus, by thee. The priestesses were making   ready to celebrate the festival of the chaste Juno by holding solemn games   and by the sacrifice of a heifer native to the place. It was a strong motive   for</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_91"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 91</FONT></A></p>   
<p>lingering there awhile, to witness the rite, though full steep is the path   that leads to the scene of its performance.</p>   
<p>It is an immemorial grove, and so dense is the foliage there that the   daylight cannot penetrate the gloom. One needs but to behold it, to realise   that it is the abode of a divinity. An altar receives the prayers and incense   offered by the faithful, a rough-hewn altar made by the artless folk of olden   days. From this spot, once a year, as soon as the trumpet has given forth its   solemn note, the procession sets out and makes its way along the carpeted   paths. Snow-white heifers are led along amid the plaudits of the throng,   heifers nourished by the grass of their native fields, and calves whose brows   are not yet armed with threatening horns, and the humble pig, a lowlier   victim, and the leader of the herd with horns curved back over his stubborn   head. The goat alone is hateful to the lady goddess, ever since the day when   by a goat her presence was betrayed in a deep wood and she was forced to   abandon her flight. And so, even now, the boys pursue her with their darts   and she is given as a prize to the one that brings her low.</p>   
<p>All along the way the goddess is to pass, boys and shy maidens strew the   paths with carpets. Gold and gems sparkle in their virgin hair and the proud   mantle hides their gold-decked feet. In the Grecian manner of their ancestors   they pass on, Clad in white, and on their head they bear the sacred vessels   entrusted to their care. Peep silence holds the people while the stately   procession is passing by, and after her priestesses, follows the goddess   herself.</p>   
<p>The whole procession tells of Greece. After the murder of Agamemnon,   Halesus fled the scene of his crime and the rich lands of his forefathers. It   was only after many adventures, both by land and sea, that with auspicious   hands he reared a high-walled city. &#8217;Twas he that taught the Falisci to   celebrate the rites of Juno. May they to me, and to her own people, ever be   propitious.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="9%">
