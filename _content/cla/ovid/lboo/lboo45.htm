<p>SHALL I believe any longer that the gods exist? She has broken her sworn   oath, and her loveliness is unimpaired. Long was her hair before she took the   gods to witness. Now that she has deceived them, it is just as long. The   whiteness of her skin was suffused with the hue of the rose, and the rose   still blooms on her snowy check. She had a little foot; her foot is still the   daintiest thing on earth. Tall was she, and graceful. Tall and graceful is   she still. Her eyes shone like stars; many a time with them has she deceived   me.</p>   
<p>And so the gods themselves allow beautiful women to break their vow, and   Beauty herself is a goddess. It was, I remember, only the other day that she   swore by her own eyes and by mine; it was mine that felt the smart. Ye gods,   if the deceitful little thing has hoodwinked you, how is it you have punished   me for her crime? It is true you did not hesitate to decree death to the   daughter of Cepheus, in punishment for her mother's pride. If I have found   you vain and ineffectual witnesses, if she plumes herself on having fooled us   both, have I got to suffer for her perjury, have I to be at once her   scapegoat and her dupe?</p>   
<p>Either the gods exist in name alone, a mere chim&aelig;ra</p>

<p>invented to terrify the silly credulous rabble, or, if exist they do, they   display gross favouritism towards women, and let them do what they like. It   is only against us men that Mars is armed with his death-dealing sword; only   against us that Pallas turns her fatal spear. At us Apollo aims his arrows.   At us, and us alone, the thunderbolt is sped from sovran Jove's right hand.   The gods have not the courage to punish the misdeeds of women, and not being   able to terrify them, are themselves in terror of them. And are, we going on   burning incense on their altars? No, men ought to have more spirit.</p>   
<p>Jupiter demolishes sacred woods and citadels, but he withholds his wrath   from perjured women. Out of the whole host of lying jades, only Semele   perished by the flames. And that was because she was so willing. If she had   evaded the attentions of her lover, the father of Bacchus would never have   had to do a mother's duties.</p>   
<p>And why do I thus fall out with all the company of heaven? The gods have   eyes, as we have, they have hearts like ours. If I were a god myself, I   should never quarrel with a woman because she took my name in vain. I should   swear that the jade swore truly, and I'd never be known for a crusty god.</p>   
<p>But you, my dear, use the gods a little more sparingly; or at all events   have a thought for your lover's eyes.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="10%">
