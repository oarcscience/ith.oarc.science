<p>COME, bind ye my brows, ye laurels of victory, for I have conquered; lo,   in my arms I hold her, this wonderful Corinna, whom husband, watchman, oaken   door and all such enemies to love, were guarding from the invader. This is a   victory specially deserving of triumphal honours, since the prize, without   bloodshed, has been gained. No lowly ramparts, nor towns with narrow moats   begirt, but a woman it is that my generalship has won.</p>   
<p>When, after twice five years of war, Troy fell, what, among so many   claimants for reward, was the prize that fell to Atreus' son? But now, the   glory of the day is mine and mine alone; no other can demand his share of the   spoils. I was the leader, I the host, that took the citadel by storm.   Cavalry, infantry and standard-bearer I. By no mischance did Fortune mar my   feats. A Triumph then for me, the guerdon of my efforts! The cause of my   campaign is no new thing. Had not the daughter of Tyndarus been carried off,   the peace of Europe and of Asia had not been disturbed. &#8217;Twas a woman   who, when the wine was going the rounds, stirred up to mutual strife the   fierce Lapith&aelig; and the monstrous race of the Centaurs. &#8217;Twas a   woman who, in thy kingdom, good Latinus, forced the Trojans to begin</p>

<p>fresh wars; &#8217;twas woman who, when the City was but newly founded,   did cause the bloody conflict when the Romans had to battle with the fathers   of their wives. Bulls I have seen fighting for a snow-white heifer, which,   looking on at the fray, stirred them to fresh exploits. Me too, as others oft   before me, hath Cupid bidden march to battle under his banners, but mine was   a bloodless victory.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="9%">
