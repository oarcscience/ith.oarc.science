<p>I HAVE had a lot to put up with, and I've put up with it a great deal too   long. I am completely out of patience with you. My heart is tired out. Away   with you, base Love! My slavery is over; I have escaped my fetters, and what   I bore without shame, it now shames me to have borne at all. I've won the   day; Love is vanquished. I trample it beneath my feet. True, I've been a long   time plucking up courage. Fight on, my soul, and faint not. It is a wrench,   indeed, but some day you'll be glad you bore this present pain. A bitter   potion has oftentimes brought succour to the sick.</p>   
<p>How could I have sunk so low, after so many rebuffs, as to he down on the   hard ground outside your door? Could I for some other lover you had with you   there, act the slave and play the watchman outside the door that was shut   against me? I have seen him coming away from your house, looking a very   worn-out warrior indeed. Seeing him was not so bad as being seen by him, all   the same. May such a disgrace befall my enemies.</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_88"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 88</FONT></A></p>   
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Tell me when I have ever failed to be at your side, your escort,   your lover, and your friend. You owe your popularity to going about with me.   It's because I loved you that you got so many lovers. What's the use of my   telling you about your lying tongue, and all the solemn oaths you've broken   to deceive me? What's the good of referring to the ogling and winking that   went on at dinner between you and your young admirers, and the code words   employed to conceal the true sense of what you were saying. One day they told   me she was ill. I nearly had a fit, and off I rushed. I get there and   find-well, that she isn't too ill to entertain my rival.</p>   
<p>There! there are plenty of other instances I could give, but that's the   sort of thing I've had to put up with. Look and see if you can find another   man who would stand what I have stood. Already I can hear the water rippling   behind my vessel's stern, hung with the votive wreath. Farewell. No, I don't   want any more kisses; and it's no good talking like that any more; it's waste   of time; your words don't move me now. I'm not the madman I used to be.-Yet   oh, this wavering heart of mine! How it is torn this way and that, wrung   simultaneously by love and hate; and love, I think, is winning the day. I   will hate, if I am able; if not, I will love, but not willingly. The ox, too,   loves not the yoke. He hates it; but still he bears it. Even as I fly your   perfidy, your beauty draws me back. I hate the depravity of your soul; I love   your body. Thus I can live neither with you nor without you, and I know not   what I want myself I would that you were less fair or less wicked. Such   loveliness goes ill with such evil ways. Your conduct bids me hate; your   beauty bids me love. Hapless indeed am I; her charms outweigh the evil deeds   of their possessor.</p>   
<p>Forgive me, I beseech you, by the laws of our mutual love; forgive me by   all the gods who lend themselves so often to thy false oaths; by that face   that seems to me a</p>

<p>thing divine, and by thine eyes which have made captives of mine. Whatever   you may be, you ever will be mine. Thine it is to say whether you would have   me a willing or unwilling lover. Ah, let us spread our sails and profit by   the prospering gales, that, though against my will, I shall yet be forced to   love.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="9%">
