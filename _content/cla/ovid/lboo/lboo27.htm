<p>AWAY with thee, Cupid and thy quiver! Love's not such a priceless thing   that I should so often and so desperately long for death. Aye, for death I   long, when I bethink me of thy perfidy, thou thankless girl, born to be a   lasting grief to me. &#8217;Tis not thy tablets carelessly effaced that   reveal thy conduct to me; &#8217;tis not the presents secretly received that   tell me thy misdeeds. Would to heaven I could fail to prove the accusation   that I bring against thee. Ah, hapless me, why is my cause so good! Happy the   lover who can boldly defend the woman he adores; happy he to whom his   mistress may say, "Free of all guilt am I!" Hard of heart is he,   and too indulgent of his grief, who would seek to win a sanguinary triumph by   bringing home a crime to the woman that he loves.</p>   
<p>Alas, I saw it all when you thought I was asleep. Aye, with these eyes did   I behold your treason, for the wine beside me had not dulled my vision. I saw   you making</p>

<p>eyes at him, I saw your nods of the head, and read it all as plainly as if   it had been written down in words. Your eyes were not silent; I saw letters   writ in wine upon the table, even thy fingers had their tale to tell. Try as   yon would to hide it, I read the meaning of your discourse, and guessed the   cipher of your secret code. And now the throne of guests had left the table   and only two remained, both young, both drunk with wine. And then I saw you   both exchange most wanton kisses, kisses in which, as I too plainly saw, your   tongues were intermingled. Not such kisses as a sister gives her sober-minded   brother, but such as a loving mistress might bestow upon her eager lover; not   such kisses as Ph&#339;bus to Diana gives, but such, we may believe, as Venus   often lavished on her darling Mars.</p>   
<p>"How now!" cried I. "On whom dost thou bestow the favours   that are mine? Nay, these things are mine by right. My right I'll hold, my   right I will defend. Thy kisses are for me and mine for thee, alone. What   does this interloper, then, coming between us twain?"</p>   
<p>In such-like words did I outpour my grief. The blush of shame   o&#8217;erspread her guilty cheeks. So flushes the eastern sky when Tithonus'   spouse arises from his bed, and so doth blush the maiden when her betrothed   resteth his gaze upon her. So roses shine when lilies round them blow; so   turns the pale moon red when by some magic spell her course in heaven is   stayed; so gleams Assyrian ivory that a M&aelig;onian dame has dyed with   crimson so that it may not yellow grow with years. Such then, or as near as   may be, was the colour of the wench's cheeks, and never had I seen her look   more lovely. She looked on the ground; the look became her. Sad was her   countenance; the sadness suited her. Her hair, and deftly was it braided, I   nearly tore out by the roots. Her dainty cheeks, I all but laid rude hands   upon. But when I saw her face, my arms fell strengthless at my side; by   weapons of her own was my mistress defended. I who</p>

<p>a moment since she had seen so fierce and menacing, now cast myself at her   feet and begged her to give me kisses no less tender. She smiled, and then,   with all her heart and soul, gave me a kiss, and never was kiss more sweet.   &#8217;Twas such a kiss as would have filched the thunderbolt from the hand   of angry Jove. Yet how my breast is tortured now, lest another may have   tasted kisses just as sweet; I hope that those were not of this celestial   quality. These last kisses that she gave me were better far than those which   I had taught her; she hath, methinks, acquired some novel art. It bodes no   good, this too, too luscious sweetness; it bodes no good that all your tongue   within my mouth was thrust, all mine within your own. And &#8217;tis not this   alone that grieves me; not only of these voluptuous kisses that I complain,   albeit complain I do, but what rankles most is the thought that lessons such   as those could have been given nowhere but in bed, and I know not who is the   instructor that has received such rich remuneration.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="9%">
