<p>THOUGH I am sitting here, it's not in the least because I am interested in   the racing; all the same! I want your favourite to win. What I've come here   for is to talk to you, to sit near you and to tell you how tremendously I   love you. So you are looking at the races, I am looking at you. Let us both   enjoy the sight that pleases, both drink our fill of delight. He's a lucky   fellow, the man you back; he has the good fortune to enlist your interest. I   wish I had his chance; like a flash I should be at the starting-post, and let   my horses run clean away with me. Here, I'd shake the reins about their   necks, here, I'd let them feel the whip, then round I'd go within a hair's   breadth of the</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_68"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 68</FONT></A></p>   
<p>turning-post. But if, in my headlong career, I chanced to catch sight of   you, I should pull up and the reins would drop from my hands. Ah, how   narrowly Pelops escaped falling by a spear at Pisa, through gazing on thy   face, Hippodamia! Nevertheless, he won because his mistress favoured him. May   all lovers thus triumph when their ladies want them to.</p>   
<p>Why do you keep trying to edge away from me? You can't do it; we've got to   sit close because of the seats. That's an advantage I owe to the Circus   arrangements. But you, there, who are sitting on the other side of this lady,   mind what you're about; don't lean on her like that. And you behind there; don't   thrust out your legs like that; don't let your hard knee dig into her back.   Mind, darling, you're letting your dress drag on the ground. Pull it up a   little, or I shall have to do it for you. Ah, jealous dress, how you liked to   cover her beautiful legs. Aye, and the longer you looked--oh, you jealous   dress, you! Atalanta's legs must have looked like yours, when she was   running--no wonder Milanion wanted to catch hold of them--and Diana's too,   when, with uplifted dress, she pursueth the wild beasts in the forests,   beasts less fearless than herself. Though I never saw them, those legs set me   on fire. What would happen if I saw yours? You will be adding fuel to fire,   water to the ocean. I can just imagine, from what I've seen, what those other   charms are like that you conceal so well under your dainty dress.</p>   
<p>Would you like to have a little cool air in your face? If I wave this   tablet a little it will refresh you, unless it's the warmth of my passion   rather than the warmth of the air that is heating you, and lighting up such a   charming flame in your heart. While I've been speaking, a horrid black smut   has come and settled on your white dress. Begone, base smudge, from those   snowy shoulders. But here they come; keep still and drink it all in. Now's   the time to clap; the procession is coming in all its splendour.</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_69"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 69</FONT></A></p>   
<p>First of all comes Victory, with wings outspread. Be kind to me, O   goddess, and help my love to win. Three cheers for Neptune, you rash people   that put your trust in the sea. As for me, I don't like it. I prefer my own   bit of land. You, my soldier friend, shout loud for Mars, he is your god. I   loathe fighting. I love peace and love that thrives with peace. Let   Ph&#339;bus be propitious to the augurs, and Phoebe to the huntsmen, and you,   Minerva, receive the salutations of the craftsmen. And you, ye tillers of the   soil, give hail to Ceres and to kindly Bacchus. May Pollux hearken to the   gladiators' prayers and Castor to the horseman's. For us, &#8217;tis thee,   sweet Venus, thee and the Loves, thy bowmen, that we greet with cheers. Oh,   help me, tender goddess; change thou my fair one's heart, that she may let   herself be loved. See, Venus nods, and seems to tell me I shall win. What she   foretells, tell me yourself, I pray. Hear thou my prayer and--Venus forgive   me--you will be greater than that goddess herself. I swear it, and all the   gods that shine in that procession I call to witness, you shall ever be my   darling mistress. But you've nowhere to rest your legs. Put your toes, if you   like, on these bars. They've cleared the course now, and the big races are   going to begin. The pr&aelig;tor's just given the signal. The four-horsed   chariots are off. I see your favourite. Whoever you favour is bound to win.   The very horses seem to guess your wishes. Ye gods, how wide he takes them   round the turning-post. Wretched creature, what are you about? Now you've let   your rival get ahead of you. He went round ever so much more closely. What <i>are</i> you up to, foolish one? What's the   use of a woman's backing you. For heaven's sake pull your left rein hard. Oh,   he's an idiot, our man. Come on, Romans, have him back, wave your togas   there. See they're calling him back. But mind they don't ruffle your hair,   waving their togas about like that; come and hide your head in the folds of   mine.</p>   
<p>Look, now they're starting again, the bars are down.</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_70"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 70</FONT></A></p>   
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Here they come, with their different colours, driving like mad. Beat   them this time, anyhow; you've got a clear field in front of you. See that my   mistress has her way, and see that I have mine. Well, she's got hers; but I   must wait. He's won. Now I must see what I can do. She smiled, the darling,   and there was a promise in her look. That's enough for here. Elsewhere you'll   let me have the rest.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="9%">
