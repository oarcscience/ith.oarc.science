<p>RIVER, whose soft, muddy banks are overgrown with reeds, I am hastening to   my mistress. Stay thy course a while. No bridge hast thou, nor oarless bark   to ferry me with a rope across thy stream.</p>   
<p>But lately thou wast just a rivulet, I mind me well, and fearlessly I   traversed thee on foot, and in thy deepest part thou scarce did wet my   ankles. Now, swollen by the melting snows from yonder mountain, thou rushest   wildly on and along thy muddy course pourest a foaming mass of waters.</p>   
<p>What did it boot me so to press my speed, to have snatched such scanty   rest, to have turned night into day, if here I needs must halt, if to the   farther bank I have no means to cross? Oh, wherefore, do I lack the wings   which bore the heroic son of Dana&euml; when he carried off Medusa's head   swarming with dreadful serpents? Now long I for the chariot whence came the   seed of Ceres, scattered o&#8217;er the stubborn soil. Alas these wonders,   save in a poet's dream, were never wrought. Never were they seen of man, and   never man will see them. But thou, O stream that overflowest thy wide banks,   flow on within thy bounds, and so flow on for ever. Ne'er couldst thou bear   the weight of public shame, if it were known thou stayedst a lover's steps.</p>   
<p>Verily rivers should help an eager lover on his way, for rivers themselves   have known the pangs of love. Pale Inachus, they say, was smitten with the   charms of Melie, the Bithynian nymph, and his chill waters warmed with his   love for her. Troy had not borne its ten long years of siege, O Xanthus, when   Neaera drew thy gaze. What made Alpheus wander through so many lands if not   his passion for a maid of Arcady? And thou, Peneus, when</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_76"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 76</FONT></A></p>   
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Creusa unto Xanthus was betrothed, hid her so &#8217;tis held,   within the land of the Phthiotians.</p>   
<p>Why should I tell of Asopus, whom warlike Thebe took to her bosom, Thebe   fated to give five daughters to the world? And thou, O Achelo&uuml;s, if I   ask of thee to-day, "Where are thy horns?" thou wouldst with sorrow   make reply and say that in his wrath Hercules did break them off. What   Hercules would not have done for Calydon, would not have done for all   &AElig;tolia, he did for Dejanira and for her alone. The Nile itself, the   mighty river that through seven mouths flows to the sea and hides so well the   secret of its source, could not with all its waters overwhelm the flame with   which he burned for Evadne, Asopus' daughter. Enipeus, so he might embrace   the daughter of Salmoneus, commanded his waters to recede, and, obedient to   his command, those waters did recede. Nor thee will I forget who, flowing   down thy rocky bed, waterest with thy foaming stream the fruitful fields of   Argive Tibur; nor thee whom Ilia charmed, albeit in sorry plight was she, her   hair, her features torn with her own nails, mourning her uncle's sacrilegious   crimes, and the outrage wrought by Mars, wandering bare-footed in solitary   places. Her, from his swift-flowing waters, the generous river saw, and   raising his head above the flood called hoarsely to her, saying,   "Wherefore in sorrow wanderest thou by my banks, O Ilia, seed of   Laomedon of Ida? Whither hath thy raiment gone? Whither bendest thou thy   lonely steps? Wherefore doth the white fillet bind not thy rang&egrave;d   hair? Wherefore dost thou weep and mar thy brimming eyes with tears? Why thus   in frenzy beat thy naked breast? A heart of stone or brass that man must   have, who on a lovely face all stained with tears can look unmoved by pity.   Ilia, fear no more; for thee my palace will fling wide its portals, my waters   from all harm shall keep thee. Ilia, fear no more; over a hundred nymphs or   more thou shalt be queen, for a hundred</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_77"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 77</FONT></A></p>   
<p>nymphs or more beneath my waters dwell. Oh, spurn me not, I pray, thou   seed of Troy; gifts richer than my promises thou shalt have."</p>   
<p>He spake; and Ilia, with downcast eyes, bathed with tears her heaving   bosom. Thrice she essayed to fly; thrice she stayed her steps by the edge of   the deep waters, for fear would not suffer her to flee. Howbeit, at last,   tearing her hair with hostile hand, with trembling lips thus sorrowfully she   spake: "O would to heaven my bones had been gathered up and laid in the   tomb of my fathers while yet I was a virgin. Wherefore to marriage dost thou   invite me, a vestal yesterday, to-day unworthy to tend the sacred fire of   Ilium? Why should I longer tarry? Fen now they point at me with scornful   finger and exclaim, 'Behold the adulteress.' Let me die, and with me die the   shame that suffers me not to raise my eyes without a blush." She said,   and veiling with her robe her lovely weeping eyes, she cast herself   despairingly into the swirling flood. The River, so &#8217;tis said, upstayed   her, placing his hand beneath her breast, and took her as a bride to the   bridal bed.</p>   
<p>And thou, like enough, hast burned with love for a maiden; but thou hast   woods and forests to hide thy little failings. Even as I speak, thy waters   swell still more, and thy bed, broad though it be, is not wide enough to hold   the tributary streams that flow to thee from every side. What grievance hast   thou against me, thou angry river; why dost thou delay the pleasures of a   pair of lovers; why hold me up so roughly on my way? If only thou didst flow   with waters of thine own, if only thou wert a river with a name, if thy fame   throughout the world were known! But name hast thou none; thy waters come from   little tributary brooks; thy source and even thy course are uncertain. Thy   spring is the rain and melted snow, and these thou owest to sluggish winter.   Either in winter-tide thou rollest thy turgid waters, or else, in summer, thy   bed is but a dry and sandy</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_78"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 78</FONT></A></p>   
<p>track. What traveller then has e&#8217;er found water enough to quench his   thirst and say to thee in thankfulness of heart, "Flow on, flow on for   ever!"</p>   
<p>Onward thou flowest, harmful to flocks and herds, more harmful still to   crops. For these things let others grieve, my own ills suffice for me. Fool   that I am, this stream I told how rivers love. It shames me to have spoken of   names so great before so miserable a brook. What was I dreaming of, to speak   to it of Achelo&uuml;s and of Inachus, and of thee, wide-flowing Nile?</p>   
<p>Out on thee, muddy torrent. Scorching summers and rainless winters ever be   thy lot!</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="9%">
