<p>IS she not fair, is she not accomplished? Have I not long hungered to possess   her? Yet she, yes, she of all women in the world, I have held in my arms and   to no purpose. To my shame I confess it, I have lain like a lifeless hulk   upon her couch, strengthless and still. Despite my longings, despite my loved   one's longings, I could not stir myself into life. In vain about my neck she   twined her ivory arms, dear arms, more white than Thracian snows. In vain her   tongue she thrust and thrust against my tongue, and slipped her amorous thigh   beneath my own; vainly she lavished on me all her sweetest names, called me   her conqueror and said the things that women ire wont to say in such a pass;   it was as though my members had been rubbed with chilling hemlock and knew no   more the way to do their duty. Like to a trunk I lay, like to a lifeless   statue, a useless mass, so that indeed she might have doubted whether I were   in sooth a man, or but the simulacrum of a man.</p>

<p>What shall I do when I am old, supposing that I live so long, if I fail so   lamentably now that I am young? Alas, I blush for my youth. I am young, I am   a man, and I could not prove to my mistress that I was either. She left her   bed, even as the holy priestess that watches the everlasting flame of Vesta,   or as a chaste sister saying farewell to a beloved brother. Howbeit, it was   but lately that I paid my debt twice over with the fair-haired Chloe; thrice   with the white-skinned Pitho; thrice again with Libas; and, by Corinna urged,   nine times in one short night I fought with honour in the lists of love.</p>   
<p>Was it some magic philtre that benumbed my limbs to-day? Was it some   incantation, or some poisonous herb that put me in such a sorry plight? Was   it some witch that wrote my name on the crimson wax and plunged a needle into   my liver? The corn, stricken by a witch's curse, soon dwindles into sterile   grass, the springs run dry, the acorn falls from the oak, the grape from the   vine and the fruit drops from the tree, though no one shake the bough. Since   this is so, why should not magic numb the nerves? Perchance &#8217;twas magic   that turned me into ice. And then, think on the shame of the thing! Yes, my   very shame robbed me of my strength. Shame was the secondary cause of my   undoing.</p>   
<p>How fair, withal, was she on whom I was free to look, and whom I was free   to touch, for I touched her, even as the shift she wore. At that sweet   contact the King of Pylos would have grown young again, Tithonus would have   felt strange promptings for his years. In her I found a woman; she found not   in me a man. To what fresh vows, to what new prayer shall I have recourse   to-day? Doubtless the gods regret they ever gave me such a prize, seeing the   shameful use I made of it.</p>   
<p>I longed with feverish longing to be admitted to her house; I was   admitted; to kiss her, and I kissed her; to lie with her, I lay with her. What   availed me my good fortune? To be a king and wield no sceptre? Like a</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_80"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 80</FONT></A></p>   
<p>miser in the midst of wealth, I owned my riches, but I could not use them.   Thus was the prying Tantalus consumed with thirst, with water all around;   thus saw the fruit on which he ne'er could lay his hand; thus in the morning,   the husband leaves his wife in order to go stainless to the altar of the   gods.</p>   
<p>Maybe, you'll say, she did not shower on me kisses most passionate and   most sweet; she did not do her utmost to excite me. The stoutest oaks, the   hardest adamant, the sternest rocks would have been moved by her caresses.   She would have moved any living thing, anything you could dub a man. But   then, alas, I was neither living nor a man. What pleasure would the songs of   Phemius bring to ears that could not hear? What pleasure would a picture give   to sightless Thamyris?</p>   
<p>What delights, withal, I had secretly promised myself, what different ways   of enjoying her had I imagined. And yet my body, shame on it, was like a dead   thing, more drooping than a rose of yesterday. And look at it now, and high   time it is, see how it is coming back to life again; see how it is asking to   be up and doing, to get to work once more. Why are you not overcome with   shame, thou vilest part of me? That was how you made a fool of me before,   promising what you did not fulfil. Through you my mistress was deceived,   through you I found myself a defaulter, through you I suffered the most   painful affront, the most grievous damage.</p>   
<p>And yet my mistress disdains not to incite me with her dainty hand. But   seeing that all her arts were vain, that my body, forgetful of its former   prowess, would give no sign of life, cried, "Why do you play the fool   with me? Who asked you, madman that you are, to come to bed with me against   your will? Or has some enchantress of &AElig;&aelig;a, with her needle and   her wool, bewitched you? Or have you been spending your strength on some   other woman?"</p>   
<p>So saying, she leapt from the bed with nothing on but</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_81"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 81</FONT></A></p>   
<p>her flimsy shift, and fled away bare-footed. And, as she would not have   her servants know she had come unscathed from the combat, she went and laved   herself with water to dissemble the affront.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="9%">
