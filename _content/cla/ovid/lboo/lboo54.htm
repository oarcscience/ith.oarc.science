<p>WHAT day was that, ye birds of mournful plumage, when ye sang things of   evil. presage to my love-affairs? What star shall I suspect is moving counter   to my fate, what gods shall I complain are making war against me? The woman   who but now confessed herself my own, of whom I was the first the only lover,   to-day I fear I share with many rivals.</p>   
<p>Am I at fault, or is it my verses that have made her the talk? &#8217;Tis   even so. My genius hath made of her a wanton. And I deserve it. For why did I   vaunt her beauty? If she sells herself to-day, mine is the fault. I am the   power that hath made her please; &#8217;tis I who have brought her lovers;   these hands have opened the door to them.</p>   
<p>Whether verses are good for aught, I much misdoubt me; they have always   wrought me ill. &#8217;Twas they excited envy of my treasure.</p>   
<p>Though of Thebes I might sing, and Troy and C&aelig;sar's mighty deeds,   Corinna alone could fire my genius. Would to heaven that the Muses had been   unfavourable to my songs and that Ph&#339;bus had deserted me when my task   was but begun. Yet since it is the custom to give ear to what the poets say,   I should not have wished my verses to have had no weight.</p>   
<p>&#8217;Tis we who sang of Scylla stealing from her father's</p>

<p>head his treasured locks and hiding in her womb the raging dogs.   &#8217;Tis we who have given wings to the feet and serpents to the hair, our   song gave victory to Abos' child and the wing&egrave;d horse. &#8217;Tis we   gave Tityos his mighty stature, and to Cerberus gave his triple mouths and his   serpent-crown&egrave;d head. Enceladus we made hurling the spear with a   thousand arms, and through us a youthful sorceress overcame heroes by her   magic spells. We imprisoned the winds of &AElig;olus in the wine-skins of the   Ithacan king; we made the prying Tantalus go mad with thirst, with water all   around him; Niobe we changed into a rock, and a young maiden into a bear.   &#8217;Tis thanks to us that the bird of Cecrops sings Odrysian Itys; that   Jove transforms himself into a bird, or into gold, or, taking on the   semblance of a bull, cleaves the waters with a maiden on his back. Why tell   of Proteus and those dragon's teeth whence sprang the Thebans? Shall I tell   of the bulls that spewed forth flames, and of the tears of amber that flowed,   Orega, from thy sister's cheeks; of ships changed into sea goddesses; of the   sun shrinking in horror from the sight of Atreus' dreadful feast and of the   rocks that followed the music of the lyre?</p>   
<p>Unceasing the genius of the poets pours forth, and recks not of the   trammels of historic truth. Thus the praises of my mistress should have been   looked upon as false. I have been undone by your credulity.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="9%">
