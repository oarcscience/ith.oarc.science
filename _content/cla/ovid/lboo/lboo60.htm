<p>I HAVE just armed the Greeks against the Amazons; now, Penthesilea, it   remains for me to arm thee against the Greeks, thee and thy valiant troop.   Fight with equal resources and let the victory go to he side favoured by   beloved Dione and the boy who flies over the whole world. It was not right to   expose you, all defenceless as you were, to the attacks of a well-armed foe.   Victory, my men, at such a price as that would be a disgrace.</p>   
<p>But perchance one among you will say to me, "Wherefore give fresh   poison to the snake, wherefore surrender the lamb to the raging wolf?"   Now forbear to condemn the whole sex for the crimes of a few of its members;   let every woman be judged on her own merits. If the young Alcides had reason   to complain of Helen, if his elder brother could with justice accuse   Clytemnestra, Helen's sister; if, through the crime of Eriphyle, the daughter   of Talaos, Amphiaraus went riding to the under-world on his living steeds, is   it not also true that Penelope remained chaste when sundered from her husband   who was kept for ten years fighting before Troy and who, when Troy had   fallen, wandered over the seas for ten years more? Look at Laodamia, who, in   order to join her husband in the grave, died long before her tale of years was   told. And Alcestis, who, by sacrificing her own life, redeemed her husband,   Admetus, from the tomb. "Take me in thine arms, Capaneus, and let our   ashes at least be mingled," exclaimed the daughter of Iphis, and   forthwith leapt into the midst of the pyre.</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_154"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 154</FONT></A></p>   
<p>Virtue is a woman both in vesture and in name; what wonder, therefore,   that she should favour her own sex? Nevertheless, it is not these lofty souls   that my art requires; lighter sails are suited to my pinnace. Only wanton loves   are the burden of my discourse; to women I am about to teach the art of   making themselves beloved.</p>   
<p>Woman cannot resist the flames and cruel darts of love, shafts which,   methinks, pierce not the heart of man so deeply. Man is ever a deceiver;   woman deceives but rarely. Make a study of women, you'll find but few   unfaithful ones among them. False Jason cast off Medea when she was already a   mother, and took another woman to his arms. It is no thanks to thee, O   Theseus, that Ariadne, abandoned on an unknown shore, fell not a prey to the   birds of the sea.</p>   
<p>Wherefore did Phyllis return nine times to the seashore? Ask that question   of the woods, who, in sorrow for her loss, shed their green raiment. Thy   guest, Dido, for all his much-belauded conscience, fled from thee leaving   thee nought save the sword that brought thee death. Ah, hapless ones, shall I   reveal to you the cause of your undoing? You knew not how to love. You lacked   the art, and art makes love endure. And even now they would still continue in   their ignorance, but that Cytherea bids me instruct them. Into my presence   did Cytherea come and thus she did command. "What ill, then, have they   wrought thee, these unhappy women, that thou deliverest them, all defenceless   as they are, into the hands of the' men whom thou thyself hast armed? Thou   hast devoted two poems to instructing men. And now the women in their turn   demand thy aid. The poet who had outpoured the vials of his scorn on the wife   of Menelaus, soon repented, and sang her praises in a palinode. If I know   thee truly., thou art not the man to be unkind to the women. Thou wouldst   rather seek to serve them so long as thou dost</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_155"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 155</FONT></A></p>   
<p>live." Thus she spake, and from the wreath that crowned her hair, she   took a leaf and a few myrtle berries, the which she gave to me. As I took   them, an influence divine was shed about me. The air shone purer round about   me, and it seemed as though a burden had been lifted from my heart.</p>   
<p>While Venus inspires me, my fair ones, give ear unto my counsel. Modesty   and the law and your privileges permit. Bethink you, then, of old age which   cometh all too soon, and not an instant will you lose. While yet you may, and   while you yet enjoy the spring-time of your years, taste of the sweets of   life. The years flow on like to the waters of a river. The stream that   fleeteth by, never returns to the source whence it sprang. The hour that hath   sped returns again no more. Make the most of your youth; youth that flies   apace. Each new day that dawns is less sweet than those which went before.   Here, where the land is rough with withering bracken, I have seen the violet   bloom; from this thorny bush, I once did wreathe me garlands of roses. Thou   who rejectest love, to-day art but a girl; but the time will come when, all   alone and. old, thou wilt shiver with cold through the long dark hours in thy   solitary bed. No more shall rival swains come of a night and, battling for   your favours, batter down your doors; no more, of a morning, will you find   your threshold strewn with roses. Ah me! How soon the wrinkles come; how   swiftly fades the colour from the beauteous cheek! Those white hairs, which   (so at least you swear) you had when you were quite a child, will swiftly   cover all your head. The snake, when he sloughs off his skin, sloughs off the   burden of his years, and the stag, when he sprouts new horns, renews his   youth. But nothing brings amends for what Time filches from us. Pluck, then,   the rose and lose no time, since if thou pluck it not &#8217;twill fall   forlorn and withered, of its own accord. Besides, the toil of child-bearing   shortens the span of youth;</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_156"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 156</FONT></A></p>   
<p>too frequent harvests make the soil wax old. Blush not, O Ph&#339;be, that   thou didst love Endymion upon the Latmian height. And Dawn, thou goddess of   the rosy fingers, that thou didst bear off Cephalus, was no shame to thee   Nay, though of Adonis we refrain to speak, whom Venus still doth mourn   to-day, to whom, if not to love, owed she &AElig;neas and Hermione? Follow   then, ye mortal maidens, in the footsteps of these goddesses; withhold not   your favours from your ardent lovers.</p>   
<p>If they deceive you, wherein is your loss? All your charms remain; and   even if a thousand should partake of them, those charms would still be   unimpaired. Iron and stone will wear thin by rubbing; that precious part of   you defies attrition, and you need never fear &#8217;twill wear away. Doth a   torch lose aught of its brightness by giving flame to another torch? Should   we fear to take water from the mighty ocean? "A woman," you will   say, "ought not thus to give herself to a man." Come now, why not?   What does she lose? Nought but the liquid which she may take in again at   will. Ah, no! I am not telling you to make drabs of yourselves; but merely   not to be scared of some imaginary ill; the bestowal of such gifts will never   make you poor.</p>   
<p>But I am still within the harbour. A gentle breeze will waft me to the   main. Once well out on the open sea, I shall be borne along by a stronger   wind. Let me begin with dress. A well-tended vine yields a good harvest, and   high stands the corn on the well-tilled field. Good looks are the gift of   God; but how few can pride themselves upon their beauty. The majority of you   have not been vouchsafed this favour. A careful toilet will make you   attractive, but without such attention, the loveliest faces lose their charm,   even were they comparable to those of the Idalian goddess herself. If the   beautiful women of ancient times recked not of their appearance, the men were   not a whit less careless.</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_157"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 157</FONT></A></p>   
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> If Andromache arrayed herself in a coarse tunic, why should we   marvel? She was the wife of a rugged soldier. Would the wife of Ajax come   richly apparelled to a warrior clad in the hides of seven oxen? In those   far-off days, the ways of our forefathers were rude and simple. Rome nowadays   is all ablaze with gold, rich with the wealth of the world that she hath   conquered. Look at the Capitol; compare it now with what it once was. You   would say it was a temple consecrated to another Jupiter. The palace of the   Senate, worthy now of the august assembly that sits within it, was, in the   days when Tatius was king, nothing but a thatched cottage. These gorgeous   edifices on the Palatine Hill, built in honour of Apollo and our great   leaders, were once but pasture ground for oxen that dragged the plough. Let   others belaud those ancient times; I am satisfied to be a child of to-day. I   find it better suited to my tastes, not because nowadays we ransack the   bowels of the earth for gold, and import purple dyes from distant shores; not   because we see the mountains shrink because we are eternally quarrying them   for marble; not because vast moles keep far away the billows of the deep; but   because we enjoy the amenities of life, and because those rough and boorish   ways, which for a long time characterised our ancestors, have not endured to   our day.</p>   
<p>Nevertheless, burden not your ears with those sumptuous pearls which the   dusky Indian seeks beneath the green waves. Go not forth in garments heavily   inwrought with gold. The wealth by which you would fain attract us, very   often just repels us. Neatness is what we like. Let your hair be nicely done.   That depends greatly on the skill of the person that dresses it. Of course   there are innumerable ways of doing it. Every woman should study to find out   the style that suits her best; and for that her mirror is the surest guide!   Long features demand that the hair should be simply parted</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_158"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 158</FONT></A></p>   
<p>on the forehead. Such was the style of Laodamia. Women with round faces   should wear their hair lightly twisted into a knot on the top of the head,   leaving the ears exposed. One woman will let her hair fall loose on either   shoulder, like Apollo when he holds his dulcet lyre. Another must needs have   her hair tied up behind, like Diana when she pursueth the wild beasts in the   forests. One delights us with her loose flowing ringlets, another by wearing   her hair closely patted down upon her temples. Some women like to adorn their   hair with the shell of the Cyllenian tortoise, others to wear it in towering   waves. But there are not more acorns on an oak tree, more bees on Hybla, or   wild beasts on the mountains, than there are modes of doing a woman's hair,   and new ones are invented every day. Some women look well with their hair   done in careless fashion: you might think it hadn't been done since   yesterday. In point of fact it has only just been combed. Artifice should   look like carelessness. Such was Iole when Hercules first saw her in the   captured city. "That is the woman for me," he exclaimed. Such, too,   was Ariadne, forsaken on the shores of Naxos, when Bacchus bore her away in   his chariot, while the Satyrs cried, "Evo&euml;" Ah, you women!   Nature, kindly toward your charms, has given you how many means to repair the   ravages of time! We men, alas, grow bald. Our hair, of which time robs us,   falls even as the leaves when the North wind brings them down. A woman will   dye her hair with the juice of some German herb; and the artificial colour   becomes her better than the natural one. A woman will appear wearing a mass   of hair that she has just purchased. For a little money she can buy another's   tresses. She'll do the deal without a blush, quite openly, in front of   Hercules and the Virgin band.</p>   
<p>Now what shall I say about clothes? I care not for those golden flounces,   or wool twice dipped in Tyrian purple? There are so many other colours that   cost</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_159"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 159</FONT></A></p>   
<p>less money. Why carry all your fortune on your back? Look at this azure   blue like a clear sky when the wind has ceased to herd the rain clouds from   the South. Now look, too, at this golden yellow; &#8217;tis the colour of the   ram which once on a time saved Phryxus and Helle from the snares of Ino. That   green is called water-green from the colour that it imitates; I could easily   imagine that the Nymphs were clothed in such apparel. This hue resembles   saffron; it is the colour wherein. Aurora arrays herself when, moist with   dew, she yokes her shining coursers to her car. There you will recognise the   colour of the myrtle of Paphos; here the purple amethyst, the whitening rose,   or the Thracian stork; and here again the colour of thy chestnuts, Amaryllis,   or thy almonds, or the colour of that stuff to which wax has given its name.   As numerous as the flowers which blow when sluggish Winter hath departed, and   when beneath the Spring's soft breath, the vine puts forth its buds, so many   and more are the hues that wool receives from all its many dyes. Choose then   with care, for all colours are not becoming to all people. Black suits a fair   complexion: it became Briseis; she was dressed in black when she was carried   off. White suits dark people; white, Andromeda, set off your charms, and   &#8217;twas white that you were wearing when you set foot on the isle of   Seriphos.</p>   
<p>I was going to tell you not to let your armpits smell, and to see that   your legs were not rough with bristles. But it's not, of course, to the coarse   Caucasian women I am addressing my remarks, nor yet to the women who drink   the waters of the Caicus. I need not tell you never to neglect to keep your   teeth white and to rinse your mouth out every morning with clean water. With   wax you know how to whiten your skin, and with carmine to give yourself the   rosy hue which Nature has denied you. Your art will tell you how to fill the   space between your eyebrows, if it be too, faintly marked, and how,</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_160"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 160</FONT></A></p>   
<p>with cosmetics, to conceal the all too patent evidence of the growing   years. You fear not to increase the brightness of your eyes with finely   powdered ash, or with the saffron that grows on the banks of the Cydnus. I   have told of the ways of restoring beauty in a work, which though slender, is   of great value by reason of the studied care with which I wrote it. Consult   it for the remedies you need, all you young women on whom Nature has not   lavished her favours. You will find my treatise abounds in useful counsel.</p>   
<p>But on no account let your lover find you with a lot of "aids to   beauty" boxes about you. The art that adorns you should be unsuspected.   Who but would feel a sensation of disgust if the paint on your face were so   thick that it oozed down on to your breasts? What words could describe the   sickening smell of the &#339;sypum although it comes from Athens; that oily   juice which they extract from the fleece of sheep. I should also disapprove   of your using stag's marrow, or of your cleaning your teeth when anyone is   there to see. I know all that would enhance your charms, but the sight would   be none the less disagreeable. How many things revolt us in the process,   which delight us in the achievement. Those famous masterpieces of the   sculptor Myron were once but useless, shapeless blocks of marble. If you want   a ring of gold, you've got to hammer it into shape; the material you wear was   once dirty, evil-smelling wool. That marble, once an unhewn block, is now a   masterpiece--Venus, naked, wringing the water from her dripping hair. Let   your servants tell us you are still asleep, if we arrive before your toilet's   finished. You will appear all the lovelier when you've put on the finishing   touch. Why should I know what it is that makes your skin so white? Keep your   door shut, and don't let me see the work before it's finished. There are a   whole host of things we men should know nothing about. Most of these various   artifices would give us a</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_161"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 161</FONT></A></p>   
<p>nasty turn, if you didn't take care not to let us see them. Look at those   brilliant ornaments that adorn the stage. If you examined them closely, you   would see that they are merely gilded wood. None of the audience are allowed   to go near till everything is finished and in order. Just in the same way,   it's only when the men are away that you ought to do your titivating.</p>   
<p>Howbeit, I do not b any means forbid you to comb your hair before us; I   love to see it fall in floating tresses about your shoulders. But never get   vexed or petulant, and don't keep on fidgeting with your curls. Don't treat   your maid so as to make her in terror of you. I detest the sort of shrew that   scratches her maid's face, or sticks a needle in her arm, in a fit of temper.   It makes the poor girl wish the devil would take the head she is holding   between her hands, and with blood and tears she moistens her mistress's   hateful tresses. Every woman who has but little hair should have a sentinel   at her door, or else always have her hair attended to in the temple of the   Bona Dea. One day I was announced unexpectedly to my mistress, and in her   flurry she put on her false hair all awry. May such a mischance never befall   any but our enemies! May such a disgrace be reserved for the daughters of the   Parthians. A mutilated animal, a barren field, a leafless tree are hideous   things to see: a bald head is not less so.</p>   
<p>&#8217;Tis not to you, Semele or Leda, that I address my lessons, nor to   thee, O fair Sidonian, who wast borne by a fictitious bull across the seas;   nor yet to Helen whom thou with reason, Menelaus, didst demand, and whom   thou, her ravisher, did with equal reason refuse to give up. My host of   pupils is composed of fair women and of plain, and these latter always   outnumber the rest. The pretty ones are less in need of art's assistance and   take its admonitions less to heart; they are the fortunate possessors of   charms whose potency owes nought to art. When the sea is calm, the mariner</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_162"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 162</FONT></A></p>   
<p>lays him down to rest in careless ease; when the tempest sets it on a   roar, he quits not his station even for an instant.</p>   
<p>Rare, however, is the face without a fault. Hide these blemishes with   care, and so far as may be, conceal the defects of your figure. If you are   short, sit down, lest when standing you should be thought to be sitting; if   you are a dwarf, lie stretched at full length on your couch, and so that none   may see how short you are, throw something over your feet to hide them. If   you are thin, wear dresses of thick material and have a mantle hanging   loosely about your shoulders. If you are sallow, put on a little rouge; if   you are swarthy, see what the fish of Pharos will do for you. Let an ungainly   foot be hid in a white leathern shoe. If your legs are thin, don't be seen   unlacing your sandals. If your shoulder-blades are prominent, little pads   will correct the defect. If you have too full a bust, contain it with a <i>brassi&egrave;re</i>.   If your fingers are stumpy and your nails unsightly, don't gesticulate when   you are talking. If your breath is strong, you should never talk when your   stomach's empty, and always keep some distance away from your lover. A woman   whose teeth are discoloured, or prominent, or uneven, will often give herself   away when she laughs. Who would imagine it? Women are even taught how to   laugh. Even in such a detail as that, they study to be charming. Don't open   your mouth too wide; let the dimples on either side be small, and let the   extremity of the lips cover the upper part of the teeth. Don't laugh too   often and too loud. Let there be something feminine and gentle in your   laughter, something agreeable to the ear. Some women cannot laugh without   making a hideous grimace; others try to show how pleased they are, and you   would imagine they were crying; others offend the car with harsh and ugly   sounds; like the noise a dirty old she-ass makes as she brays at the   mill-stone.</p>   
<p>Where indeed does Art not have a say! Why, women</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_163"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 163</FONT></A></p>   
<p>even learn to weep gracefully; to cry when they will, and as much as they   will. And then there are women who don't pronounce a certain letter in their   words, and lisp with affectation when they come to it. This assumed defect   lends them an added charm; so they actually practise speaking imperfectly.   All these, are details, but, since they have their uses, practise them   assiduously. Learn also how to walk as a woman should. There is a style in   walking that should be carefully cultivated; and that style, or the lack of   it, will often attract or repel a stranger. This woman, for example, walks   with an elegant swing from the hips; her gown floats gracefully in the   breeze, and she moves with dignity and charm. And here again is a woman who   elbows her way along with huge strides like the red-faced wife of an Umbrian   peasant. But in this matter of walking, as in everything else, we must have a   sense of proportion. One woman will walk too much like a country wench,   another with over-much mincing and affectation. Then, again, you should leave   uncovered the top of your shoulder and the upper part of your left arm. That   is especially becoming to women who have a white skin. At the mere sight of   it, I should be mad to cover all I could touch with kisses.</p>   
<p>The Sirens were monsters of the deep, and, with their wondrous singing,   stayed the swiftest vessels in their flight. When their song fell upon his   ears, Ulysses was sore tempted to unbind himself from the mast; as for his   companions, their ears were stopped with wax. Music is a soothing thing.   Women should learn to sing. Many a woman has made up for her lack of beauty   by the sweetness of her voice. Sometimes sing over the songs you have heard   at the theatre; sometimes sing voluptuous, Oriental airs. A woman, who is   fain to attract, should know how to play the lute and the harp. Thracian   Orpheus, with his lyre, charmed rocks and wild beasts, aye, and Acheron and   the triple-headed</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_164"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 164</FONT></A></p>   
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Cerberus. And thou, Amphion, righteous avenger of thy mother's   wrong, didst thou not behold stones rise up at the sound of thy voice and   range themselves into walls? Who has not heard of the wonders wrought by   Arion with his lyre? Even the dumb fish is said to have listened, enchanted,   to his song. Learn, too, to sweep the strings of the joyous psaltery with   either hand. &#8217;Tis an instrument favourable to the dalliance of lovers.   You should also learn Callimachus by heart, and Philetas and Anacreon, who   loved his drop of wine. And Sappho too; for what is more exciting than her   verse? Then there's the poet who tells us about a father being hoodwinked by   the crafty Geta. You might also read the verses of the tender-souled   Propertius, and the poems of my beloved Tibullus, and something out of   Gallus, or the poem Varro wrote about the golden fleece so bitterly lamented,   Phrixus, by thy sister; and the story of the fugitive, &AElig;neas, and the   origins of lofty Rome; for Latium boasts no prouder masterpiece than that.   And peradventure shall my name with theirs be numbered, and my writings shall   not be given over to the waters of Lethe, and perchance someone will say,   "Read o&#8217;er these dainty lines wherein our Master gives instruction   both to men and women; or choose, in those three books, the which he calls   the Loves, passages which you will read with sweetly modulated voice; or, if   thou wilt, declaim with skill one of those letters from his Heroines, a kind   of work unknown before his time and whereof he himself was the   inventor." Hear my prayers, O Ph&#339;bus, hear them, mighty Bacchus,   and you, ye Muses, divine protectresses of poets.</p>   
<p>Who could doubt that I want my charmer to be skilled in the dance? I would   that, when the wine-cup is placed upon the table, she should be accomplished   in swaying her arms to the measure of the music. Graceful dancers delight   your theatre-goer. Such grace, such airy lightness, charms us all.</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_165"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 165</FONT></A></p>   
<p>I am loth to enter into petty details, but I should like my pupil to know   how to throw the dice with skill, and to calculate with nicety the impetus   she gives them as she tosses them on to the table. I should like her to know   when to throw the three numbers, and when to take and when to call. I should   wish her to play chess with skill and caution. One piece against two is bound   to go under. A king that is battling, separated from his queen is liable to   be taken; and his rival is often compelled to retrace his steps. Again, when   the ball bounces against the broad racquet, you must only touch the one you   intend to serve. There is another game divided into as many parts as there   are months in the year. A table has three pieces on either side; the winner   must get all the pieces in a straight line. It is a bad thing for a woman not   to know how to play, for love often comes into being during play.</p>   
<p>Still, it is only half the battle merely to play well; the important thing   is to be master of yourself. Sometimes, when we are not properly on our   guard, when we are carried away by the heat of the game, we forget ourselves   and let our inmost nature stand revealed. Rage and love of gain, such are the   shameful vices that lay hold on us; thence spring quarrels, brawls and vain   regrets. Hot words are bandied to and fro; the air resounds with angry   shouts, and each one calls in turn on the wrathful gods for help. Then no   player trusts another: "The pieces have been tampered with," they   cry; and to have fresh ones they insist; and many a time, I've seen their   faces bathed with tears. May Jove preserve us from tantrums such as that, any   woman who aims at pleasing us.</p>   
<p>Such are the games which kindly Nature to your weakness doth vouchsafe. To   man she opens forth an ampler field: to him the flying ball, the spear, the   quoit and, daring feats of horsemanship. You are not made to strive in   contests on the field of Mars, or to</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_166"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 166</FONT></A></p>   
<p>plunge into the icy waters of the Virgin's spring, or into the tranquil   current of the Tiber. But you may, and you would do well to do so, walk in   the shade of Pompey's Portico when the fiery coursers of the Sun are entering   the constellation of Virgo. Visit the temple sacred to Apollo, to the god   whose brow is decked with the laurel, and who, at Actium, whelmed the   Egyptian fleet beneath the wave; visit those stately buildings raised by the   sister and wife of Augustus, and his son-in-law decorated with the naval   crown. Draw near to the altars where incense is offered to the sacred cow of   Memphis; visit our three theatres, splendid places for displaying your   attractions; go to the arena still warm with blood new-shed, and that goal   round which the chariots whirl with fiery wheel.</p>   
<p>Things that are hidden no one heeds, and none desires what he has never   known. What avails a beautiful face if none be there to see it? Even though   you should sing songs more sweet than the songs of Thamyras and Am&#339;beus,   who would praise the merits of your lyre, if there were none to hear it? If   Apelles, of Cos, had not given us his vision of Venus, the goddess would   still be buried beneath the waves. What does the poet long for? He longs for   fame. That is the guerdon we look for to crown our toil. Time was when poets   were the favourites of heroes and of kings, and in ancient days a choir of   singers gained a rich reward. Hallowed was the dignity and venerable the name   of Poet, and upon them great riches were often bestowed. Ennius, born in the   mountains of Calabria, was deemed worthy of being buried nigh to thee, great   Scipio. But now the poet's crown of ivy lies unhonoured, and they, who   through the hours of night do strictly meditate the Muse, are idlers held.   Howbeit, they strive, and love to strive, for fame. Who would have heard of   Homer if the <i>Iliad</i>--the deathless <i>Iliad</i>--had never seen the   light? Who would have known Dana&euml; if, for ever a</p>

<p>prisoner, she had languished till old age came upon her in her tower?</p>   
<p>You, my fair young charmers, will do well to mingle with the throng; bend   your roaming footsteps full oft beyond your thresholds. The she-wolf has her   eye on many a sheep before she selects her prey; the eagle pursues more birds   than one. Thus a pretty girl should show herself in public. In the throng   there is perhaps one lover in whom her charms will strike an answering chord.   Wherever she be, let her show herself eager to please, and let her be mindful   of everything that could enhance her charms. You never know when a chance may   occur. Always have the bait ready. The fish will come and bite when you least   expect it. It often happens that the dogs scour the woods and hills in vain,   and then the stag comes of his own accord, and steps into the net. When   Andromeda was chained to her rock, how was she to hope that anyone should   have compassion on her tears? Often a new husband is discovered at the old   one's funeral: nothing makes a woman so alluring as to walk with dishevelled   hair and let her tears flow unrestrainedly.</p>   
<p>But avoid the man that makes a parade of his clothes and his good looks,   and is on the tenterhooks lest his hair should get ruffled. The sort of thing   such men will tell you, they've said over and over again to other women.   They're of the roving sort and never settle anywhere. What <i>can</i> a woman   do when a man is more of a woman than she is, and perhaps has a bigger   following of lovers? Perhaps you won't believe this, and yet it's perfectly   true: Troy would still be standing, if the Trojans had listened to old   Priam's advice. There are men who get on good terms with women by making out   they love them; and having done so, proceed disgracefully to fleece them.   Don't be taken in by their scented locks, their dandified clothes, their affected   &aelig;stheticism, and their much-beringed fingers. Perhaps the smartest of</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_168"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 168</FONT></A></p>   
<p>all these fine gentlemen is nothing but a crook, whose sole aim is to rob   you of your fine clothes. "Give me back my property," is the burden   of many a poor woman's complaint, whom some such ruffian has taken in.   "Give me back my property," is what you are always hearing in every   court of justice. And you, O Venus, and you, ye goddesses, whose temples   grace the Appian Way, look down upon the scene unmoved. And some there are among   these rakes, whose reputation is so blown upon, that any women who are taken   in by them deserve no sympathy.</p>   
<p>Women, learn, from the misfortunes of others, how to avoid a similar fate,   and never let your door give admittance to a swindler. Beware, ye daughters   of Cecrops, of paying heed to the protestations of Theseus! It wouldn't be   the first time he had taken his solemn oath to a lie. And you,   Demopho&ouml;n, who inherited Theseus' gift for lying, how can we trust you,   seeing how you broke your vows to Phyllis! If, my dears, your lovers bring   you glittering promises, do the like to them; if they bring you presents, let   them have the favours they have bargained for. A woman who, after receiving   presents from her lover, withholds from him the pleasure that he has a right   to, would be capable of extinguishing Vesta's eternal flame, of stealing the   sacred vessels from the temple of Inachus, and of sending her husband to his   last account with a glass of aconite and hemlock.</p>   
<p>But come now, where am I getting to? Come, my Muse, draw in your reins a   little' lest your steeds carry me beyond my goal. When your lover has paved   the way with a brief note or two, and when your wide-awake maid has duly   received and delivered them, read them over very carefully, weigh every word,   and try to find out whether his love is merely pretence or whether he really   means what he says. Don't be in too great a hurry to answer him; suspense, if   it be not too prolonged,</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_169"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 169</FONT></A></p>   
<p>acts as a spur to love. Don't appear too accommodating to him, if he's a   youngster; on the other hand, don't rap him too severely over the knuckles.   Act in such a way as to instil him at once with hope and fear, and every time   you say " No," make him think he'll have a better chance next time.   What you write him should be ladylike, but simple and direct. Ordinary,   unaffected language pleases the most. It often happens that a letter gives   the necessary impulse to a hesitating heart; and how often too has some   clumsy uncouth utterance completely neutralised a girl's good looks.</p>   
<p>But you women who, though you don't aim at the honours of chastity, want   to cuckold your husbands without their knowing it, be sure not to send your   letters by any but a trusty hand. On no account send these evidences of your   passion to an inexperienced lover. For failing to observe this precaution, I   have seen young married women white with fear and spending their unhappy days   in a condition of continuous slavery.</p>   
<p>Doubtless it is a shame for a man to keep such damning proofs; but they   put into his hands weapons as terrible as the fires of Etna. In my idea,   deceit should be countered by deceit, just as the law allows us to repel   violence by violence. You should practise varying your handwriting as much as   possible. Foul fall the knaves that compel me to give you such advice. And   you should be sure and not write on a tablet that has been used, without   making quite sure that the original writing has been quite rubbed out, lest   the wax should give evidence of two different hands. The letters you write to   your lover should be addressed as though to a woman, and you should always   allude to him as <i>she</i>, <i>her</i>.</p>   
<p>But let us leave these minor details for graver subjects; let us cram on   all sail. If you want to retain your good looks, you must restrain your   temper. Peace, gentle peace, is the attribute of man, as rage and fury are   the characteristics of wild beasts. Rage puffs out</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_170"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 170</FONT></A></p>   
<p>the face, gorges the veins with blood, and kindles in the eye the fiery   fury of the Gorgon. "Away with thee, miserable flute, thou deservest not   that I should spoil my beauty for thee," said Pallas, when in the stream   she beheld her distorted visage. And so with you. If any of you women looked   at yourselves in the glass when you were in a raging temper, you wouldn't   know yourselves, not one of you! Another thing, just as unbecoming, is pride.   You must have a soft, appealing expression, if you want to attract a lover.   Believe an old hand at the game. A haughty, disdainful look puts a man out of   tune at once, and sometimes, even though a woman doesn't say a word, her   countenance betrays something hostile and disagreeable. Look at whoever looks   at you; smile back when you're smiled at; if anyone makes signs to you, send   back an answering signal. &#8217;Tis thus that love, after making essay with   harmless arrows, draws from his quiver his pointed darts. We also dislike   gloomy women. Let Ajax love his Tecmessa. We are a jovial company, and we   like a woman to be gay. As for you, Andromache, and you, Tecmessa, I should   never have wanted either of you for a mistress; and beyond mere   child-getting, I doubt whether your husbands sought, or found, any great   pleasure within your arms. How can we imagine so dreary a woman as Tecmessa   ever saying to Ajax, "O Light of my life," and all those other   sweet things that charm us and console.</p>   
<p>Let me be suffered to illustrate my own gay trifling art with examples   from a much more serious affair. Let me compare it to the tactics of a   general commanding an army. A leader that knows his business will entrust, to   one officer the command of a hundred infantrymen, to another a squadron of   cavalry, to another, the standards. Now you women should consider in what   respect we can serve you best, and assign to each of us his special part. If   a man's rich, make</p>

<p>him give you presents; let the legal luminary give you his professional   advice; let the eloquent barrister plead his lovely client's cause. As for us   poets, we've got nothing to offer you but our verses; but what we can do   better than the rest of them is to love, and we spread far and wide the   renown of the charmer that has succeeded in captivating us. Nemesis and   Cynthia are famous names; Lycoris from East to West is known, and now on   every hand they want to know who is this Corinna that I sing about. Perjury is   hateful to a poet, and poetry too is a great factor in the making of a   gentleman. Ambition, love of riches, these things torment us not; we reck not   of the Forum and its triumphs; all we seek is seclusion and repose. Love is   swift to take hold of us and burns us with its fiercest flame, and into our   love, alas, we put over-much of trust and confidence.</p>   
<p>The peaceful art which we pursue lends a softness to our manners, and our   mode of life is consonant with our work. My fair ones, never withhold your   favours, from the poets; the gods inspire them and the Muses smile upon them.   Ay, a god dwells within us and we commerce with the skies. From the high   heavens doth our inspiration come. How shameful to expect hard cash from a   poet; yet it's a shame no pretty woman is afraid to incur.</p>   
<p>Learn how to dissemble, and don't display your avarice all at once. Mind   you don't lose a fresh lover when he realises the trap you are laying for   him. A skilful groom doesn't treat a colt just broken like a horse that has   grown used to harness. In the same way, you won't catch a novice with the   same snare as you use for a veteran. The one, a new recruit, is fighting for   the first time in his life beneath the standards of love; he has never before   been captured, and now that you have snared him, you must let him know none   but you. He is like a young sapling, and you must surround him with a lofty   fence. Be sure to keep all possible rivals out of</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_172"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 172</FONT></A></p>   
<p>the way. You will only retain your conquest if you share it with no one.   Love's dominion, like a king's, admits of no partition. So much for the   novice. The other is an old campaigner. His pace is slower and more   deliberate. He will endure many things that a raw recruit could never stand.   He won't come battering in or burning down your front door. He won't scratch   and tear his sweetheart's dainty check till the blood comes. He won't rend   his garments, or hers either; he won't pull her hair out and make her cry.   Such tantrums as that are only permitted in youngsters, in the heyday of youth   and heat. But your older man is not a bit like that. He'll put up with all   manner of snubs. He smoulders with a small fire like a damp torch or like   green wood fresh hewn on the mountain top. His love is more sure; the other's   is more blithe, but it doesn't last so long. Be quick and pluck the fleeting   blossom. Well, let us surrender the whole stronghold, lock, stock, and   barrel. The gates have been flung open to the besiegers. Let them be easy in   their minds. The traitor won't betray them. Now if too soon you yield, too   soon you'll lose your love. Denials must be sometimes mingled with dalliance.   You must sometimes keep your lover begging and praying and threatening before   your door. Sweet things are bad for us. Bitters are the best tonic for the   jaded appetite. More than one ship has sailed to perdition with a following   wind. What makes men indifferent to their wives is that they can see them   when they please. So shut your door and let your surly porter growl,   "There's no admittance here!" This will renew the slumbering fires   of love.</p>   
<p>Now let us take the buttons off the foils, and to it with naked weapons;   though, likely enough, I am instructing you for my own undoing. When you have   netted your youthful novice, let him, at first, imagine he's the only one to   enjoy your favours. But soon let</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_173"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 173</FONT></A></p>   
<p>him apprehend a rival. Let him think there's someone else with whom he has   to share your charms. Some such tricks as these are needed, or his ardour   would soon die down. A horse never runs so fast as when he has other horses   to catch up and outpace. A slight gives a new life to our dying flame, and I   confess that, for my own part, I couldn't go on loving unless I had a   set-back to endure from time to time. But don't let him see so very much.   Make him uneasy, and let him fear there's something more than just what meets   his eye,. Tell him that some imaginary servant always has his plaguey eye   upon you. Tell him your husband's green with jealousy and always on the   prowl. That will stimulate his ardour. A safe pleasure is a tame pleasure.   Even if you were as free to have your fling as Tha&iuml;s, trump up some   imaginary fears. When it would be easier for you to have him admitted by the   door, insist on his climbing in at a window, and put on a scared expression   when he looks at you. Then let some smart maid come rushing in crying,   "We're ruined," and thrust him, trembling, into a cupboard. But   sometimes let him have his pleasure of you undisturbed, lest he begin to ask   himself whether the game is wholly worth the candle.</p>   
<p>I was not going to touch on the methods of hood winking a cunning husband   and a watchful guard. A wife should fear her husband; she should be well   looked after; that is quite as it should be; law, equity, decency--all   require it so. But that you should have to put up with such servitude, you   who have just been freed by the Lictor's rod, that would be intolerable. Come   to me, and I'll initiate you into the secret of giving them the slip. If you   had as many warders as Argus had eyes, you shall, if you really are resolved,   evade them all. For example, how is your warder going to hinder you from   writing, during the time you're supposed to be in your bath? Is he going to   prevent a servant who is in your</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_174"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 174</FONT></A></p>   
<p>secrets and aids you in your amours from carrying your missives in her   bosom under a wide shawl? Couldn't she stuff them in her stocking, or hide   them under the sole of her foot? But suppose your warder checkmates all these   subterfuges, let your confidante make her shoulders your tablets, and let her   body become a living letter. Characters written in fresh milk are a   well-known means of secret communication. Touch them with a little powdered   charcoal and you will read them. You may also do likewise with a stalk of   green flax, and your tablets will, unsuspected, take the invisible imprint of   what you write. Acrisius did everything he could think of to keep Dana&euml;   intact. Yet Dana&euml; did what she should not have done, and made a   grandsire of him. What can a woman's keeper do when there are so many   theatres in Rome, when she can go sometimes to a chariot race, sometimes to   religious celebrations where men are not allowed to show their faces? When   the Bona Dea turns away from her temples all men save, perchance, a few whom   she has bidden to come; when the unhappy keeper has to keep an eye on his   mistress's clothes outside the baths, in which, maybe, men are securely   hiding? And whenever she wants, some friend and accomplice will say she's   sick, and for all her illness accommodate her with the loan of her bed. Then,   tool the name of "adulterous" given to a duplicate key tells   plainly enough the use to which we ought to put it. Nor is the door the only   way to get into a woman's house. You can get the keeper under, however prying   he may be, by giving him a good stiff drink; an even if you have to give him   Spanish Wine, it's worth it. There are also potions that induce sleep and   cloud the brain with a darkness as heavy as Lethean night. And your   accomplice may usefully entice the pestilent fellow to hope for her favours,   and by soft dalliance make him oblivious of the fleeting hours.</p>

<p>devices when the man may be bought for a trifling tip. Presents, believe   me, seduce both men and gods. Jove himself is not above accepting a present.   What will the wise man do, when a very fool knows the value of a gift? A   present will even shut the husband's mouth. But only tip the keeper once a   year. When he's held out his hand once, he'll be holding it out for ever. I   lately complained, I remember, that one must beware of one's friends. That   unwelcome statement was not addressed solely to men. If you are too   confiding, others will win the quarry that belonged to you and someone else   will net the hare that you had started. That very kind friend, who lends you   her room and her bed, has more than once been on excessively friendly terms   there with your lover. And don't have too pretty servant-maids about you   either. More than one maid has played her mistress's part for me.</p>   
<p>Oh, what a fool I am! Why do I let my tongue run away with me like that?   Why do I offer my naked bosom to be pierced? Why do I betray myself? The bird   doesn't tell the fowler the way to snare her. The hind does not train the   hounds to hunt her. No matter; if only I can be of service, I will loyally   continue to impart my lessons, even if it means another Lemnian outrage. Act   then, my dears, in such a way as to make us think you love us; there's   nothing easier, for a man readily believes what he wants to believe. Look on   a man seductively; keep sighing deeply; ask him why he's been so long in   coming; make out you're jealous; sham indignation; look as if you're weeping,   and even scratch his face for him. He'll very soon believe that you adore   him, and as he looks upon your sufferings he'll exclaim, The woman's simply   mad about me!" especially if he's a coxcomb and thinks that even a   goddess would fall in love with him. But if he doesn't run quite straight   himself, don't, whatever you do, put yourself out too much about it. Don't go   and lose</p>

<p>your head if you hear that you are not the only pebble on the beach. And   don't be in too much of a hurry to believe everything you hear. Think of   Procris, and be warned by he, how dangerous it is to be too credulous.</p>   
<p>Nigh the soft slopes of flowery Hymettus is a hallowed fount whose lips   are fledged with tender green; and all around low-growing shrubs form not so   much a wood, a, a woodland brake; there the 'arbutus offers a kindly shelter;   rosemary and laurel and the dark-leaved myrtle shed their perfume far and   wide - there likewise grow the thick-leaved box, the fragile tamarisk, the   humble clover and the soaring pine. The leaves of all these divers trees and   plants and the tips of the blades of grass, tremble in the 'breeze, set   a-dance by the soft breath of the zephyrs. Hither young Cephalus, leaving his   comrades and his dogs would often come to rest his limbs o&#8217;erwearied   with the chase; and here, he oft would say "Come, gentle Zephyr, steal   into my breast and cool the heat wherewith I am opprest." It happened   once some busybody heard him and must needs report these harmless words unto   his anxious spouse. Procris no sooner heard this name of Zephyr than, deeming   Zephyr was some rival, she was stricken dumb with grief and fell into a   swoon. Pale was she, pale as those belated clusters which, when the   wine-harvest is over, whiten at the first touch of frost, or like those ripe   quinces which bend down the branches with their weight, or like the wild   cherry ere yet it is ripe enough for our tables. As soon as she came to   herself, she rent the flimsy garments that covered her bosom and scored her   face with her nails. Then swift as lightning, in a tempest of fury, her hair   flying in the wind, she tore across the country like some fierce M&aelig;nad.   When she reached the fatal spot, she left her companions in the valley, and   treading stealthily made her way boldly into the forest. What deed, O   senseless Procris, dost thou meditate, hiding thyself thus? What fatal   resolution</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_177"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 177</FONT></A></p>   
<p>arms thy distracted heart? Doubtless thou thinkest thou wilt see Zephyr,   thine unknown rival, come upon the scene; thou thinkest with thine eyes to   witness the unconscionable scene. Now dost thou repent thee of thy deed. For   'twere horror to surprise the guilty pair. Now dost thou glory in thy   rashness. Love tortures thee and tosses thy bosom this way and that. All   explains and excuses thy credulity. the place, the name, the story told thee,   and that fatal gift that lovers have for believing that their fears are true.   As soon as she saw the trampled grass and the print of recent footsteps, her   heart beat faster than ever.</p>   
<p>Already the noontide sun had curtailed the shadows and looked down at   equal distances upon the East and West, when Cephalus, the son of the   Cyllenian god, comes to the forest and bathes his face in the cool waters of   a spring. Hidden close at hand, Procris, torn with suspense, gazes at him   unseen. She sees him lie on the accustomed sward and hears him cry, "Come,   thou sweet Zephyr, come thou cooling breeze." O what a joyful surprise   is hers; she sees her error, and how a name had led her mind astray. Once   more she is herself. Her wonted colour comes again; she rises to her feet and   longs to fling herself into her husband's arms. But as she rises, she makes a   rustling in the leaves. Cephalus, thinking it some wild creature of the   woods, quickly seizes his bow, and even now he holds in his hands the fatal   shaft. What, O hapless one, art thou about to do? &#8217;Tis no wild animal .   . . stay thy hand! Alas, it is too late; thy wife lies low, pierced by the   arrow thou thyself hast sped! "Alas, alas " she cried. "Thou   has stricken the breast of one who loved thee. And now that Zephyr, who did   cause me so to err, bears away my spirit in the breeze. Ah me, I die . . . at   least let thy beloved hand close my eyelids." Cephalus, distraught with   grief, bears in his arms his dying loved one, and with his tears doth bathe   her cruel wound.</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_178"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 178</FONT></A></p>   
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Little by little the soul of rash Procris ebbs from her bosom, and   Cephalus, his lips pressed close to hers, receives her during breath.</p>   
<p>But let us pursue our voyage and, so that our wearied bark may reach the   haven at last, let us have done with illustrations and speak straight to the   point. No doubt you are expecting me to conduct you to banquets, and you   would like me to tell you what I have to teach you thereupon. Don't come too   soon, and don't show all your graces till the torches are alight. Venus likes   delay; and waiting lends an added value to your charms. Even if you were   plain, eyes dimmed by wine would think you beautiful, and night would fling a   veil over your imperfections. Take the food with the tips of your fingers;   and you must know that eating is itself an art. Take care to wipe your hand,   and don't leave dirty finger-marks about your mouth. Don't eat before meals   when you are at home; and when you are at table, learn to be moderate and to   eat a little less than you feel inclined to. If the son of Priam had seen   Helen eating like a glutton, he would have taken to hating her. "What a   fool I was," he would have said, "to have carried off such a thing   as that!" It were better for a young woman to drink, rather than to eat,   too freely. Love and wine go very well together. However, don't drink more   than your head will stand. Don't lose the use of your head and feet; and   never see two things when only one is there. It's a horrible thing to see a   woman really drunk. When she's in that state, she deserves to be had by the   first comer. When once she's at table, a woman should not drop off to sleep.   A sleeping woman is a whoreson temptation to a man to transgress the bounds   of modesty.</p>   
<p>I am ashamed to proceed, but Venus whispers encouragingly in my ear.   "What you blush to tell," says she, "is the most important   part of the whole matter." Let every woman, then, learn to know herself,   and to</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_179"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 179</FONT></A></p>   
<p>enter upon love's battle in the pose best suited to her charms. If a woman   has a lovely face, let her lie upon her back; if she prides herself upon her   hips let her display them to the best advantage. Melanion bore Atalanta's   legs upon his shoulders; if your legs are as beautiful as hers, put them in   the same position. If you are short, let your lover be the steed. Andromache,   who was as tall as an Amazon, never comported herself like that with Hector.   A woman, who is conspicuously tall, should kneel with her head turned   slightly sideways. If your thighs are still lovely with the charm of youth,   if your bosom is without a flaw, lie aslant upon your couch; and think it not   a shame to let your hair float unbraided about your shoulders. If the labours   of Lucina have left their mark upon you, then, like the swift Parthian, turn   your back to the fray. Love has a thousand postures; the simplest and the   least fatiguing is to lie on your right side.</p>   
<p>Never did the shrine of Ph&#339;bus Apollo, never did Jupiter Ammon,   deliver surer oracles than the sayings chanted by my Muse. If the art which I   so long have practised has aught of worth in it, then list to me; my words   will not deceive you. So, then, my dear ones, feel the pleasure in the very   marrow of your bones; share it fairly with your lover, say pleasant, naughty   things the while. And if Nature has withheld from you the sensation of   pleasure, then teach your lips to lie and say you feel it all. Unhappy is the   woman who feels no answering thrill. But, if you have to pretend, don't   betray yourself by over-acting. Let your movements and your eyes combine to   deceive us, and, gasping, panting, complete the illusion. Alas that the   temple of bliss should have its secrets and mysteries. A woman who, after   enjoying the delights of love, asks for payment from her lover, cannot surely   but be joking. Don't let the light in your bedroom be too bright; there are   many things about a woman that are best seen in</p>

And now, my fair young pupils, do as   your youthful lovers did awhile ago; upon your trophies write, "Ovid was   our master."</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="10%">

similis sit licet illa deae. <br>   corpora si ueteres non sic coluere puellae, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nec ueteres cultos sic habuere uiros:<br>   si fuit Andromache tunicas induta ualentes, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quid mirum? duri militis uxor erat.<br>   scilicet Aiaci coniunx ornata uenires, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cui tegumen septem terga fuere boum!<br>   simplicitas

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alterius dices illa fuisse Iouis. <br>   Curia, concilio quae nunc dignissima tanto, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;de stipula Tatio regna tenente fuit. <br>   quae nunc sub

haec aetas moribus apta meis,<br>   non quia nunc terrae lentum subducitur aurum<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lectaque diuerso litore concha uenit,<br>   nec quia decrescunt effosso marmore montes, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nec quia caeruleae mole fugantur aquae,<br>   sed quia cultus adest, nec nostros mansit in annos <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rusticitas priscis illa superstes auis. <br>   uos quoque nec caris aures onerate lapillis, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quos legit in uiridi decolor Indus aqua,<br>   nec prodite graues insuto uestibus auro, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per quas nos petitis, saepe fugatis, opes. <br>   munditiis capimur: non sint sine lege capilli;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;admotae formam dantque negantque manus. <br>   nec genus ornatus unum est: quod quamque decebit <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eligat et speculum consulate ante suum. <br>   longa probat facies capitis discrimina puri: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sic erat ornatis Laodamia comis. <br>   exiguum summa nodum sibi fronte relinqui, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ut pateant aures, ora rotunda uolunt. <br>   alterius crines umero iactentur utroque: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;talis es adsumpta, Phoebe canore, lyra. <br>   altera succinctae religetur more Dianae, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ut solet, attonitas cum petit illa feras. <br>   huic decet inflatos laxe iacuisse capillos,<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;illa sit adstrictis impedienda comis; <br>   hanc placet ornari testudine Cyllenea,<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sustineat similes fluctibus illa sinus. <br>   sed neque ramosa numerabis in ilice glandes, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nec quot apes Hyblae nec quot in Alpe ferae,<br>   nec mihi tot positus numero conprendere fas est: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adicit ornatus proxima quaeque dies. <br>   et neglecta decet multas coma: saepe iacere <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hesternam credas, illa repexa modo est. <br>   ars casu similis: sic capta uidit ut urbe <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alcides Iolen, 'hanc ego' dixit 'amo.' <br>   talem te Bacchus Satyris clamantibus 'euhoe'<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sustulit in currus, Cnosi relicta, suos. <br>   o quantum indulget uestro natura decori, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quarum sunt multis damna pianda modis!<br>   nos male detegimur, raptique aetate capilli, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ut Borea frondes excutiente, cadunt. <br>   femina canitiem Germanis inficit herbis, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et melior uero quaeritur arte color,<br>   femina procedit densissima crinibus emptis, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proque suis alios efficit aere suos. <br>   nec rubor est emisse: palam uenire uidemus <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herculis ante oculos uirgineumque chorum.<br>   quid de ueste loquar? nec nunc segmenta requiro <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nec te, quae Tyrio murice, lana, rubes.<br>   cum tot prodierint pretio leuiore colores, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quis furor est census corpore ferre suos?<br>   aeris, ecce, color, tum cum sine nubibus aer<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nec tepidus pluuias concitat auster aquas;<br>   ecce, tibi similis, quae quondam Phrixon et Hellen <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;diceris Inois eripuisse dolis; <br>   hic undas imitatur, habet quoque nomen ab undis: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crediderim nymphas hac ego ueste tegi. <br>   ille crocum simulat (croceo uelatur amictu, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;roscida luciferos cum dea iungit equos),<br>   hic Paphias myrtos, hic purpureas amethystos, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;albentesue rosas, Threiciamue gruem; <br>   nec glandes, Amarylli, tuae, nec amygdala desunt,<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et sua uelleribus nomina cera dedit. <br>   quot noua terra parit flores, cum uere tepenti <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uitis agit gemmas pigraque fugit hiems, <br>   lana tot aut plures sucos bibit: elige certos,<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nam non conueniens omnibus omnis erit. <br>   pulla decent niueas: Briseida pulla decebant;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cum rapta est, pulla tum quoque ueste fuit.<br>   alba decent fuscas: albis, Cephei, placebas: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sic tibi uestitae pressa Seriphos erat. <br>   quam paene admonui, ne trux caper iret in alas, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neue forent duris aspera crura pilis!<br>   sed non Caucasea doceo de rupe puellas<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quaeque bibant undas, Myse Caice, tuas. <br>   quid si praecipiam ne fuscet inertia dentes<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oraque suscepta mane lauentur aqua? <br>   scitis et inducta candorem quaerere creta;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sanguine quae uero non rubet, arte rubet.<br>   arte supercilii confinia nuda repletis<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paruaque sinceras uelat aluta genas. <br>   nec pudor est oculos tenui signare fauilla<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uel prope te nato, lucide Cydne, croco. <br>   est mihi, quo dixi uestrae medicamina formae, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paruus, sed cura grande, libellus, opus:<br>   hinc quoque praesidium laesae petitote figurae; <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;non est pro uestris ars mea rebus iners. <br>   non tamen expositas mensa deprendat amator <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pyxidas: ars faciem dissimulata iuuat.<br>   quem non offendat toto faex inlita uultu, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cum fluit in tepidos pondere lapsa sinus? <br>   oesypa quid redolent? quamuis mittatur Athenis <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;demptus ab inmundo uellere sucus ouis?<br>   nec coram mixtas ceruae sumpsisse medullas<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nec coram dentes defricuisse probem.<br>   ista dabunt formam, sed erunt deformia uisu;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multaque, dum fiunt, turpia, facta placent:<br>   quae nunc nomen habent operosi signa Myronis,<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pondus iners quondam duraque massa fuit; <br>   anulus ut fiat, primo conliditur aurum; <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quas geritis uestis, sordida lana fuit; <br>   cum fieret, lapis asper erat: nunc, nobile signum, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nuda Venus madidas exprimit imbre comas. <br>   tu quoque dum coleris, nos te dormire putemus:<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aptius a summa conspiciere manu. <br>   cur mihi nota tuo causa est candoris in ore? <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;claude forem thalami! quid rude prodis opus? <br>   multa uiros nescire decet; pars maxima rerum <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offendat, si non interiora tegas. <br>   aurea quae pendent ornato signa theatro<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inspice, contemnes: brattea ligna tegit; <br>   sed neque ad illa licet populo, nisi facta, uenire, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nec nisi summotis forma paranda uiris. <br>   at non pectendos coram praebere capillos, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ut iaceant fusi per tua terga, ueto. <br>   illo praecipue ne sis morosa caueto <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tempore, nec lapsas saepe resolue comas. <br>   tuta sit ornatrix: odi, quae sauciat ora <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unguibus et rapta brachia figit acu.<br>   deuouet, et tangit, dominae caput illa, simulque <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plorat in inuisas sanguinolenta comas. <br>   quae male crinita est, custodem in limine ponat<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;orneturue Bonae semper in aede Deae. <br>   dictus eram subito cuidam uenisse puellae: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turbida peruersas induit illa comas. <br>   hostibus eueniat tam foedi causa pudoris, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inque nurus Parthas dedecus illud eat. <br>   turpe pecus mutilum, turpis sine gramine campus, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et sine fronde frutex, et sine crine caput. <br>   non mihi uenistis, Semele Ledeue, docendae, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perque fretum falso, Sidoni, uecta boue, <br>   aut Helene, quam non stulte, Menelae, reposcis, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tu quoque non stulte, Troice raptor, habes. <br>   turba docenda uenit pulchrae turpesque puellae,<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pluraque sunt semper deteriora bonis. <br>   formosae non artis opem praeceptaque quaerunt;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;est illis sua dos, forma sine arte potens:<br>   cum mare compositum est, securus nauita cessat;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cum tumet, auxiliis adsidet ille suis.<br>   rara tamen mendo facies caret: occule mendas, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quaque potes uitium corporis abde tui. <br>   si breuis es, sedeas, ne stans uideare sedere: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inque tuo iaceas quantulacumque toro; <br>   hic quoque, ne possit fieri mensura cubantis, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iniecta lateant fac tibi ueste pedes. <br>   quae nimium gracilis, pleno uelamina filo <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sumat, et ex umeris laxus amictus eat. <br>   pallida purpureis spargat sua corpora uirgis, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nigrior ad Pharii confuge piscis opem.<br>   pes malus in niuea semper celetur aluta: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arida nec uinclis crura resolue suis. <br>   conueniunt tenues scapulis analemptrides altis: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angustum circa fascia pectus eat. <br>   exiguo signet gestu, quodcumque loquetur, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cui digiti pingues et scaber unguis erit. <br>   cui grauis oris odor numquam ieiuna loquatur<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et semper spatio distet ab ore uiri. <br>   si niger aut ingens aut non erit ordine natus <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dens tibi, ridendo maxima damna feres. <br>   quis credat? discunt etiam ridere puellae, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quaeritur atque illis hac quoque parte decor. <br>   sint modici rictus, paruaeque utrimque lacunae, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et summos dentes ima labella tegant,<br>   nec sua perpetuo contendant ilia risu, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sed leue nescioquid femineumque sonet. <br>   est, quae peruerso distorqueat ora cachinno;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cum risu laeta est altera, flere putes. <br>   illa sonat raucum quiddam atque inamabile: ridet, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ut rudit a scabra turpis asella mola.<br>   quo non ars penetrat? discunt lacrimare decenter<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quoque uolunt plorant tempore, quoque modo. <br>   quid, cum legitima fraudatur littera uoce<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blaesaque fit iusso lingua coacta sono? <br>   in uitio decor est: quaerunt male reddere uerba<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discunt, posse minus, quam potuere, loqui. <br>   omnibus his, quoniam prosunt, inpendite curam;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discite femineo corpora ferre gradu. <br>   est et in incessu pars non temnenda decoris;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allicit ignotos ille fugatque uiros.<br>   haec mouet arte latus, tunicisque fluentibus auras <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accipit, expensos fertque superba pedes;<br>   illa uelut coniunx Vmbri rubicunda mariti <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ambulat, ingentes uarica fertque gradus. <br>   sed sit, ut in multis, modus hic quoque: rusticus alter <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;motus, concesso mollior alter erit. <br>   pars umeri tamen ima tui, pars summa lacerti <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nuda sit, a laeua conspicienda manu. <br>   hoc uos praecipue, niueae, decet: hoc ubi uidi, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oscula ferre umero, qua patet usque libet. <br>   monstra maris Sirenes erant, quae uoce canora <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quamlibet admissas detinuere rates. <br>   his sua Sisyphides auditis paene resoluit <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corpora, nam sociis inlita cera fuit. <br>   res est blanda canor: discant cantare puellae,<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pro facie multis uox sua lena fuit,<br>   et modo marmoreis referant audita theatris, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et modo Niliacis carmina lusa modis. <br>   nec plectrum dextra, citharam tenuisse sinistra <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nesciat arbitrio femina docta meo.<br>   saxa ferasque lyra mouit Rhodopeius Orpheus, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tartareosque lacus tergeminumque canem. <br>   saxa tuo cantu, uindex iustissime matris, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fecerunt muros officiosa nouos. <br>   quamuis mutus erat, uoci fauisse putatur <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;piscis Arioniae fabula nota lyrae. <br>   disce etiam duplici genialia nablia palma <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uerrere: conueniunt dulcibus illa iocis. <br>   sit tibi Callimachi, sit Coi nota poetae, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sit quoque uinosi

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inuocat iratos et sibi quisque deos.<br>   nulla fides tabulae: quae non per uota petuntur?<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et lacrimis uidi saepe madere genas. <br>   Iuppiter a

uberiore uiri. <br>   sunt illis celeresque pilae iaculumque trochique <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;armaque et in gyros ire coactus equus. <br>   nec uos Campus habet, nec uos gelidissima Virgo, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nec Tuscus placida deuehit amnis aqua. <br>   at licet et prodest Pompeias ire per umbras, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virginis aetheriis cum caput ardet equis; <br>   uisite laurigero sacrata Palatia Phoebo,<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ille Paraetonicas mersit in alta rates, <br>   quaeque soror coniunxque ducis monimenta pararunt, <br>

facies cum bona teste caret. <br>   tu licet et Thamyran superes et Amoebea cantu, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;non erit ignotae gratia magna lyrae.<br>   si Venerem Cous nusquam posuisset Apelles, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mersa sub aequoreis illa lateret aquis. <br>   quid petitur sacris, nisi tantum fama, poetis? <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hoc uotum nostri summa laboris habet. <br>   cura deum fuerant olim regumque poetae,<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;praemiaque antiqui magna tulere chori;<br>   sanctaque maiestas et erat uenerabile nomen <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uatibus, et largae saepe dabantur opes. <br>   Ennius emeruit, Calabris in montibus ortus, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contiguus poni, Scipio magne, tibi.<br>   nunc hederae sine honore iacent operataque doctis <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cura uigil Musis nomen inertis habet. <br>   sed famae uigilare iuuat: quis nosset Homerum, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ilias aeternum si latuisset opus? <br>   quis Danaen nosset, si semper clusa fuisset<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inque sua turri perlatuisset anus? <br>   utilis est uobis, formosae, turba, puellae. <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saepe uagos ultra limina ferte pedes. <br>   ad multas lupa tendit oues, praedetur ut unam, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et Iouis in multas deuolat ales aues.<br>   se quoque det populo mulier speciosa uidendam;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quem trahat, e multis forsitan unus erit. <br>   omnibus illa locis maneat studiosa placendi<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et curam tota mente decoris agat. <br>   casus ubique ualet: semper tibi pendeat hamus;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quo minime credas gurgite, piscis erit. <br>   saepe canes frustra nemorosis montibus errant<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inque plagam nullo ceruus agente uenit. <br>   quid minus Andromedae fuerat sperare reuinctae<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quam lacrimas ulli posse placere suas? <br>   funere saepe uiri uir quaeritur: ire solutis <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crinibus et fletus non tenuisse decet. <br>   sed uitate uiros cultum formamque professos<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quique suas ponunt in statione comas. <br>   quae uobis dicunt, dixerunt mille puellis;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;errat et in nulla sede moratur Amor. <br>   femina quid faciat, cum sit uir leuior ipsa<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forsitan et plures possit habere uiros? <br>   uix mihi credetis, sed credite: Troia maneret, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;praeceptis Priami si foret usa sui.<br>   sunt qui mendaci specie grassentur amoris<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perque aditus talis lucra pudenda petant. <br>   nec coma uos fallat liquido nitidissima nardo<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nec breuis in rugas lingula pressa suas,<br>   nec toga decipiat filo tenuissima, nec si <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anulus in digitis alter et alter erit. <br>   forsitan ex horum numero cultissimus ille <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fur sit, et uratur uestis amore tuae. <br>   'redde meum' clamant spoliatae saepe puellae, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'redde meum' toto uoce boante foro.<br>   has, Venus, e templis multo radiantibus auro <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lenta uides lites Appiadesque tuae. <br>   sunt quoque non dubia quaedam mala nomina fama: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deceptae, a, multi crimen amantis habent. <br>   discite ab alterius uestras timuisse querellis,<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ianua fallaci ne sit aperta uiro. <br>   parcite, Cecropides, iuranti credere Theseo: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quos faciet testis, fecit et ante deos. <br>   et tibi, Demophoon, Thesei criminis heres, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phyllide decepta nulla relicta fides.<br>   si bene promittent, totidem promittite uerbis: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;si dederint, et uos gaudia pacta date. <br>   illa potest uigiles flammas extinguere Vestae<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et rapere e templis, Inachi, sacra tuis, <br>   et dare mixta uiro tritis aconita cicutis, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accepto Venerem munere si qua negat. <br>   fert animus propius consistere: supprime habenas, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Musa, nec admissis excutiare rotis. <br>   uerba uadum temptent abiegnis scripta tabellis: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accipiat missas apta ministra notas.<br>   inspice, quodque leges, ex ipsis collige uerbis<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fingat, an ex animo sollicitusque roget;<br>   postque breuem rescribe moram: mora semper amantes <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incitat, exiguum si modo tempus habet. <br>   sed neque te facilem iuueni promitte roganti<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nec tamen e duro quod petit ille nega. <br>   fac timeat speretque simul, quotiensque remittes, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spesque magis ueniat certa minorque metus. <br>   munda sed e medio consuetaque uerba, puellae, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scribite: sermonis publica forma placet. <br>   a, quotiens dubius scriptis exarsit amator<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et nocuit formae barbara lingua bonae! <br>   sed quoniam, quamuis uittae careatis honore, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;est uobis uestros fallere cura uiros, <br>   ancillae puerique manu perarate tabellas, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pignora nec iuueni credite uestra nouo. <br>   uidi ego pallentes isto terrore puellas <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seruitium miseras tempus in omne pati;<br>   perfidus ille quidem, qui talia pignora seruat, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sed tamen Aetnaei fulminis instar habent. <br>   iudice me fraus est concessa repellere fraudem, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;armaque in armatos sumere iura sinunt. <br>   ducere consuescat multas manus una figuras<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a, pereant, per quos ista monenda mihi!) <br>   nec nisi deletis tutum rescribere ceris, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ne teneat geminas una tabella manus. <br>   femina dicatur scribenti semper amator: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'illa' sit in uestris, qui fuit 'ille', notis.<br>   si licet a paruis animum ad maiora referre<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plenaque curuato pandere uela sinu, <br>   pertinet ad faciem rabidos compescere mores: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;candida pax homines, trux decet ira feras. <br>   ora tument ira, nigrescunt sanguine uenae,<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lumina Gorgoneo saeuius igne micant. <br>   'i procul hinc,' dixit 'non es mihi, tibia, tanti,' <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ut uidit uultus Pallas in amne suos. <br>   uos quoque si media speculum spectetis in ira, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cognoscat faciem uix satis ulla suam. <br>   nec minus in uultu damnosa superbia uestro: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comibus est oculis alliciendus Amor.<br>   odimus inmodicos (experto credite) fastus: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saepe tacens odii semina uultus habet. <br>   spectantem specta, ridenti mollia ride;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;innuet, acceptas tu quoque redde notas. <br>   sic ubi prolusit, rudibus puer ille relictis <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spicula de pharetra promit acuta sua. <br>   odimus et maestas; Tecmessam diligat Aiax; <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nos hilarem populum femina laeta capit. <br>   numquam ego te, Andromache, nec te, Tecmessa, rogarem, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ut mea de uobis altera amica foret.<br>   credere uix uideor, cum cogar credere partu, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uos ego cum uestris concubuisse uiris. <br>   scilicet Aiaci mulier maestissima dixit <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'lux mea' quaeque solent uerba iuuare uiros!<br>   quis uetat a magnis ad res exempla minores <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sumere nec nomen pertimuisse ducis? <br>   dux bonus huic centum commisit uite regendos, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;huic equites, illi signa tuenda dedit: <br>   uos quoque, de nobis quem quisque erit aptus ad usum, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inspicite et certo ponite quemque loco.<br>   munera det diues; ius qui profitebitur, adsit;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;facundus causam saepe clientis agat.<br>   carmina qui facimus, mittamus carmina tantum: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hic chorus ante alios aptus amare sumus. <br>   nos facimus placitae late praeconia formae: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nomen habet Nemesis, Cynthia nomen habet;<br>   Vesper et Eoae nouere Lycorida terrae: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et multi, quae sit nostra Corinna, rogant. <br>   adde, quod insidiae sacris a uatibus absunt<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et facit ad mores ars quoque nostra suos.<br>   nec nos ambitio, nec amor nos tangit habendi;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contempto colitur lectus et umbra foro. <br>   sed facile haeremus ualidoque perurimur aestu<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et nimium certa scimus amare fide. <br>   scilicet ingenium placida mollitur ab arte<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et studio mores conuenienter eunt. <br>   uatibus Aoniis faciles estote, puellae: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;numen inest illis Pieridesque fauent. <br>   est deus in nobis et sunt commercia caeli;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sedibus aetheriis spiritus ille uenit.<br>   a doctis pretium scelus est sperare poetis; <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me miserum, scelus hoc nulla puella timet. <br>   dissimulate tamen, nec prima fronte rapaces <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;este: nouus uiso casse resistet amans. <br>   sed neque uector equum, qui nuper sensit habenas, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comparibus frenis artificemque reget, <br>   nec, stabilis animos annis uiridemque iuuentam <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ut capias, idem limes agendus erit. <br>   hic rudis et castris nunc primum notus Amoris, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;qui tetigit thalamos praeda nouella tuos,<br>   te solam norit, tibi semper inhaereat uni;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cingenda est altis saepibus ista seges. <br>   effuge riualem: uinces, dum sola tenebis; <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;non bene cum sociis regna Venusque manent. <br>   ille uetus miles sensim et sapienter amabit, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multaque tironi non patienda feret;<br>   nec franget postes, nec saeuis ignibus uret<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nec dominae teneras adpetet ungue genas<br>   nec scindet tunicasue suas tunicasue puellae<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nec raptus flendi causa capillus erit.<br>   ista decent pueros aetate et amore calentes; <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hic fera composita uulnera mente feret. <br>   ignibus heu lentis uretur, ut umida faena, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ut modo montanis silua recisa iugis. <br>   certior hic amor est: breuis et fecundior ille:<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quae fugiunt, celeri carpite poma manu. <br>   omnia tradantur (portas reserauimus hosti)<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et sit in infida proditione fides. <br>   quod datur ex facili, longum male nutrit amorem: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;miscenda est laetis rara repulsa iocis.<br>   ante fores iaceat, 'crudelis ianua!' dicat<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multaque summisse, multa minanter agat. <br>   dulcia non ferimus; suco renouemur amaro; <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saepe perit uentis obruta cumba suis.<br>   hoc est, uxores quod non patiatur amari: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conueniunt illas, cum uoluere, uiri.<br>   adde forem, et duro dicat tibi ianitor ore <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'non potes,' exclusum te quoque tanget amor. <br>   ponite iam gladios hebetes, pugnetur acutis; <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nec dubito, telis quin petar ipse meis.<br>   dum cadit in laqueos, captus quoque nuper, amator<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;solum se thalamos speret habere tuos. <br>   postmodo riualem partitaque foedera lecti <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sentiat: has artes tolle, senescet amor. <br>   tum bene fortis equus reserato carcere currit, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cum quos praetereat quosque sequatur habet.<br>   quamlibet extinctos iniuria suscitat ignes:<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;en ego, confiteor, non nisi laesus amo. <br>   causa tamen nimium non sit manifesta doloris, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pluraque sollicitus, quam sciet, esse putet. <br>   incitat et ficti tristis custodia serui<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et nimium duri cura molesta uiri.<br>   quae uenit ex tuto, minus est accepta uoluptas;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ut sis liberior Thaide, finge metus.<br>   cum melius foribus possis, admitte fenestra<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inque tuo uultu signa timentis habe. <br>   callida prosiliat dicatque ancilla 'perimus!' <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tu iuuenem trepidum quolibet abde loco. <br>   admiscenda tamen Venus est secura timori, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ne tanti noctes non putet esse tuas.<br>   qua uafer eludi possit ratione maritus<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quaque uigil custos, praeteriturus eram. <br>   nupta uirum timeat, rata sit custodia nuptae; <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hoc decet, hoc leges iusque pudorque iubent. <br>   te quoque seruari, modo quam uindicta redemit, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quis ferat? ut fallas, ad mea sacra ueni.<br>   tot licet obseruent, adsit modo certa uoluntas, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quot fuerant Argo lumina, uerba dabis. <br>   scilicet obstabit custos ne scribere possis, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sumendae detur cum tibi tempus aquae; <br>   conscia cum possit scriptas portare tabellas, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quas tegat in tepido fascia lata sinu.<br>   cum possit sura chartas celare ligatas, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et uincto blandas sub pede ferre notas!<br>   cauerit haec custos, pro charta conscia tergum <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;praebeat, inque suo corpore uerba ferat. <br>   tuta quoque est fallitque oculos e lacte recenti <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;littera (carbonis puluere tange, leges), <br>   fallet et umiduli quae fiet acumine lini, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ut ferat occultas pura tabella notas.<br>   adfuit Acrisio seruandae cura puellae;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hunc tamen illa suo crimine fecit auum. <br>   quid faciat custos, cum sint tot in Vrbe theatra, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cum spectet iunctos illa libenter equos;<br>   cum sedeat Phariae sistris operata iuuencae, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quoque sui comites ire uetantur, eat;<br>   cum fuget a templis oculos Bona Diua uirorum, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;praeterquam siquos illa uenire iubet? <br>   cum, custode foris tunicas seruante puellae<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;celent furtiuos balnea multa iocos; <br>   cum, quotiens opus est, fallax aegrotet amica<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et cedat lecto quamlibet aegra suo;<br>   nomine cum doceat, quid agamus, adultera clauis, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quasque petas non det ianua sola uias? <br>   fallitur et multo custodis cura Lyaeo, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;illa uel Hispano lecta sit uua iugo; <br>   sunt quoque, quae faciant altos medicamina somnos<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uictaque Lethaea lumina nocte premant; <br>   nec male deliciis odiosum conscia tardis <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;detinet, et longa iungitur ipsa mora.<br>   quid iuuat ambages praeceptaque parua mouere, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cum minimo custos munere possit emi? <br>   munera, crede mihi, capiunt hominesque deosque: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;placatur donis Iuppiter ipse datis. <br>   quid sapiens faciet? stultus cum munere gaudet:<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ipse quoque accepto munere mutus erit. <br>   sed semel est custos longum redimendus in aeuum;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saepe dabit, dederit quas semel, ille manus. <br>   questus eram, memini, metuendos esse sodales;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;non tangit solos ista querella uiros.<br>   credula si fueris, aliae tua gaudia carpent<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et lepus hic aliis exagitatus erit. <br>   haec quoque, quae praebet lectum studiosa locumque,<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crede mihi, mecum non semel illa fuit. <br>   nec nimium uobis formosa ancilla ministret: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saepe uicem dominae praebuit illa mihi. <br>   quo feror insanus? quid aperto pectore in hostem <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mittor, et indicio prodor ab ipse meo? <br>   non auis aucupibus monstrat, qua parte petatur,<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;non docet infestos currere cerua canes.<br>   uiderit utilitas; ego coepta fideliter edam: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lemniasin gladios in mea fata dabo. <br>   efficite (et facile est) ut nos credamus amari: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prona uenit cupidis in sua uota fides. <br>   spectet amabilius iuuenem et suspiret ab imo <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;femina, tam sero cur ueniatque roget;<br>   accedant lacrimae, dolor et de paelice fictus, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et laniet

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;posse suo tangi credet amore deas. <br>   sed te, quaecumque est, moderate iniuria turbet, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nec sis audita paelice mentis inops;<br>   nec cito credideris: quantum cito credere laedat, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exemplum uobis non leue Procris erit. <br>   est prope purpureos colles florentis Hymetti<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fons sacer et uiridi caespite mollis humus;<br>   silua nemus non alta facit; tegit arbutus herbam; <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ros maris et lauri nigraque myrtus olent; <br>   nec densum foliis buxum

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'accipienda sinu, mobilis aura, ueni.' <br>   coniugis ad timidas aliquis male sedulus aures<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;auditos memori detulit ore sonos; <br>   Procris, ut accepit nomen, quasi paelicis, Aurae, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;excidit, et subito muta dolore fuit; <br>   palluit, ut serae lectis de uite racemis <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pallescunt frondes, quas noua laesit hiems, <br>   quaeque suos curuant matura Cydonia ramos<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cornaque adhuc nostris non satis apta cibis.<br>   ut rediit animus, tenues a pectore uestes <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rumpit et indignas sauciat ungue genas; <br>   nec mora, per medias passis furibunda capillis <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;euolat, ut thyrso concita Baccha, uias.<br>   ut prope peruentum, comites in ualle relinquit, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ipsa nemus tacito clam pede fortis init. <br>   quid tibi mentis erat, cum sic male sana lateres, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procri? quis adtoniti pectoris ardor erat? <br>   iamiam uenturam, quaecumque erat Aura, putabas <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scilicet, atque oculis probra uidenda tuis.<br>   nunc uenisse piget (neque enim deprendere uelles), <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nunc iuuat: incertus pectora uersat amor:<br>   credere quae iubeant, locus est et nomen et index<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et quia mens semper quod timet, esse putat.<br>   uidit ut oppressa uestigia corporis herba, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pulsantur trepidi corde micante sinus. <br>   iamque dies medius tenues contraxerat umbras, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inque pari spatio uesper et ortus erant: <br>   ecce, redit Cephalus siluis, Cyllenia proles, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oraque fontana feruida pulsat aqua. <br>   anxia, Procri, lates; solitas iacet ille per herbas<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et 'Zephyri molles auraque' dixit 'ades.' <br>   ut patuit miserae iucundus nominis error, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et mens et rediit uerus in ora color.<br>   surgit et oppositas agitato corpore frondes <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mouit, in amplexus uxor itura uiri;<br>   ille feram mouisse ratus, iuuenaliter artus <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corripit, in dextra tela fuere manu. <br>   quid facis, infelix? non est fera, supprime tela! <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me miserum, iaculo fixa puella tuo est. <br>   'ei mihi!' conclamat 'fixisti pectus amicum:<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hic locus a Cephalo uulnera semper habet. <br>   ante diem morior, sed nulla paelice laesa: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hoc faciet positae te mihi, terra, leuem.<br>   nomine suspectas iam spiritus exit in auras;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;labor, io: cara lumina conde manu.' <br>   ille sinu dominae morientia corpora maesto <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sustinet, et lacrimis uulnera saeua lauat;<br>   exit et incauto paulatim pectore lapsus <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;excipitur miseri spiritus ore uiri. <br>   sed repetamus opus: mihi nudis rebus eundum est, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ut tangat portus fessa carina suos. <br>   sollicite expectas, dum te in conuiuia ducam, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et quaeris monitus hac quoque parte meos.<br>   sera ueni positaque decens incede lucerna: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grata mora uenies; maxima lena mora est. <br>   etsi turpis eris, formosa uidebere potis, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;et latebras uitiis nox dabit ipsa tuis. <br>   carpe cibos digitis (est quiddam gestus edendi),<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ora nec immunda tota perungue manu. <br>   neue domi praesume dapes, sed desine citra <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quam capis; es paulo quam potes esse minus.<br>   Priamides Helenen auide si spectet edentem, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oderit, et dicat 'stulta rapina mea est.'<br>   aptius est, deceatque magis potare puellas: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cum Veneris puero non male, Bacche, facis. <br>   hoc quoque, qua patiens caput est, animusque pedesque <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constant, nec, quae sunt singula, bina uide. <br>   turpe iacens mulier multo madefacta Lyaeo:<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;digna est concubitus quoslibet illa pati. <br>   nec somnis posita tutum succumbere mensa: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per somnos fieri multa pudenda solent. <br>   ulteriora pudet docuisse, sed alma Dione <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'praecipue nostrum est, quod pudet,' inquit 'opus.'<br>   nota sibi sit quaeque; modos a corpore certos <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sumite: non omnes una figura decet. <br>   quae facie praesignis erit, resupina iaceto;<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spectentur tergo, quis sua terga placent. <br>   Milanion umeris Atalantes crura ferebat: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;si bona sunt, hoc sunt accipienda modo. <br>   parua uehatur equo: quod erat longissima, numquam <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thebais Hectoreo nupta resedit equo. <br>   strata premat genibus, paulum ceruice reflexa<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;femina per longum conspicienda latus. <br>   cui femur est iuuenale, carent quoque pectora menda, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stet uir, in obliquo fusa sit ipsa toro. <br>   nec tibi turpe puta crinem, ut Phylleia mater, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soluere, et effusis colla reflecte comis. <br>   tu quoque, cui rugis uterum Lucina notauit, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ut celer auersis utere Parthus equis. <br>   mille modi Veneris; simplex minimique laboris, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cum iacet in dextrum semisupina latus. <br>   sed neque Phoebei tripodes nec corniger Ammon <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uera magis uobis quam mea Musa canet; <br>   si qua fides, arti, quam longo fecimus usu, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;credite: praestabunt carmina nostra fidem. <br>   sentiat ex imis Venerem resoluta medullis <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;femina, et ex aequo res iuuet illa duos.<br>   nec blandae uoces iucundaque murmura cessent<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nec taceant mediis improba uerba iocis. <br>   tu quoque, cui Veneris sensum natura negauit, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dulcia mendaci gaudia finge sono. <br>   infelix, cui torpet hebes locus ille, puella, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quo pariter debent femina uirque frui.<br>   tantum, cum finges, ne sis manifesta, caueto: <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effice per motum luminaque ipsa fidem. <br>   quam iuuet, et uoces et anhelitus arguat oris; <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a pudet! arcanas pars habet ista notas. <br>   gaudia post Veneris quae poscet munus amantem, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;illa suas nolet pondus habere preces. <br>   nec lucem in thalamos totis admitte fenestris:<br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aptius in uestro corpore multa latent. <br>   lusus habet finem: cygnis descendere tempus, <br>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duxerunt collo qui iuga nostra
