<p>HERE is the yearly festival of Ceres come round again: and my lady has to   sleep in a lonely bed. Golden-tress&egrave;d Ceres, with thy fine hair   adorned with ears of corn, wherefore, on thy feast day, dost thou deny us our   pleasure? All the world over, the nations laud thy generosity and no other   divinity looks upon us mortals with more favouring eye.</p>   
<p>In the earliest times the rude inhabitants of the countryside never baked   their bread, and the threshing floor was for them a name unknown. But upon   the oaks, the</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_86"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 86</FONT></A></p>   
<p>earliest oracles, grew acorns; these and the tender shoots of grass were   the food of man. It was Ceres who first taught him how to plant the seed in   the earth so that it should swell and, with the sickle, to reap the golden   corn; she it was who first compelled the bulls to bear the yoke and clove,   with the plough's sharp tooth, the ground that too long had been lying   fallow. Can anyone believe that she delights in the tears of lovers, and that   the way to her favour is to lie in lonely misery? Nay, though she takes pleasure   in the labour of the fields, she is not coy and awkward, nor is her heart   impervious to love. I call the Cretans to witness, and &#8217;tis not all   fable that you hear in Crete, so proud of having nurtured mighty Jove. There   was reared the Sovereign of the starry realms; &#8217;twas there that with   his baby lips he sucked the sweet milk. Here the witnesses are worthy of   credence; their foster-child will vouch for the truth of what they tell and   Ceres, I think, will confess to a frailty of which the whole world knows.</p>   
<p>At the foot of Mount Ida the goddess had perceived the youthful Iasius,   who, with unerring aim, was slaying the wild beasts. She saw, and suddenly   she felt her marrow on fire with a secret flame. On one side shame, on the   other love, were striving to possess her heart. Love triumphed over shame.   Thenceforth you might have seen the furrows grow dry, and the earth produced   scarcely as many grains of corn as had been sown. When, with the mattock, he   had thoroughly turned over the soil and with the plough had broken the   stubborn glebe, when he had scattered the seed evenly over his wide fields,   the hopes of the husbandman were brought to nought.</p>   
<p>The goddess who watches over the crops was dallying in the deep forests.   The wreaths of corn had fallen from her long tresses. Only in Crete was the   year fruitful and the harvests abundant. Wheresoever the goddess had passed,   the earth was thick with crops. Ida, so rich in trees, grew white with corn   and the wild boat cropped</p>   
<p><A NAME="page_87"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 87</FONT></A></p>   
<p>the corn in the woodlands. Minos, the lawgiver, wished for many such years   and longed for the love of Ceres to endure.</p>   
<p>The pain thou wouldst have endured, O fair-tressed goddess, if thou hadst   been compelled to sleep away from thy lover, I am forced to undergo on this   day that is hallowed to thy mysteries. Wherefore must I be sad, when thou   hast found again a daughter, a queen only less exalted than Juno herself?   Such a holiday invites to Love, to Song and to Wine. Such are the offerings   it behoves us to make to the gods that rule the world.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="9%">
