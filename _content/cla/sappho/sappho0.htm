<P>Immortal Aphrodite of the shimmering thone, daughter of Zeus,
weaver of wiles, I pray thee crush not my spirit with anguish
and distress, O Queen.  But come hither if ever before thou didst
hear my voice afar, and hearken, and leaving the golden house of
thy father, camest with chariot yoked, and swift birds drew thee,
their swift pinions fluttering over the dark earth, from heaven
through mid-space. Quickly they arrived; and thou blessed one with
immortal countenance smiling didst ask: What now is befallen me and
why now I call and what I in my heart's madness, most desire.
What fair one now wouldst thou draw to love thee?  Who wrongs thee
Sappho? For even if she flies she shall soon follow and if she rejects
gifts, shall soon offer them and if she loves not shall soon love,
however reluctant. Come I pray thee now and release me from cruel
cares, and let my heart accomplish all that it desires, and be thou
my ally.</P>

                 I
Shimmering-throned immortal Aphrodite,
Daughter of Zeus, Enchantress, I implore thee,
Spare me, O queen, this agony and anguish,
     Crush not my spirit

                 II
Whenever before thou has hearkened to me--
To my voice calling to thee in the distance,
And heeding, thou hast come, leaving thy father's
     Golden dominions,

                 III
With chariot yoked to thy fleet-winged coursers,
Fluttering swift pinions over earth's darkness,
And bringing thee through the infinite, gliding
     Downwards from heaven,

                  IV
Then, soon they arrived and thou, blessed goddess,
With divine contenance smiling, didst ask me
What new woe had befallen me now and why,
     Thus I had called the.

                  V
What in my mad heart was my greatest desire,
Who was it now that must feel my allurements,
Who was the fair one that must be persuaded,
     Who wronged thee Sappho?

                  VI
For if now she flees, quickly she shall follow
And if she spurns gifts, soon shall she offer them
Yea, if she knows not love, soon shall she feel it
     Even reluctant.

                  VII
Come then, I pray, grant me surcease from sorrow,
Drive away care, I beseech thee, O goddess
Fulfil for me what I yearn to accomplish,
     Be thou my ally.

<P>
That one seems to me the equal of the gods, who sits in
thy presence and hears near him thy sweet voice and lovely
laughter; that indeed makes my heart beat fast in my bosom.
For when I see thee even a little I am bereft of utterance,
my tongue is useless and at once a subtle fire races under my
skin, my eyes see nothing, my ears ring, sweat pours forth
and all my body is seized with trembling.  I am paler than
[dried] grass and seem in my madness little better than dead,
but I must dare all ...

</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
                    I

Peer of the gods, the happiest man I seem
Sitting before thee, rapt at thy sight, hearing
Thy soft laughter and they voice most gentle,
     Speaking so sweetly.


                    II

Then in my bosom my heart wildly flutters,
And, when on thee I gaze never so little,
Bereft am I of all power of utterance,
     My tongue is useless.

                    III

There rushes at once through my flesh tingling fire,
My eyes are deprived of all power of vision,
My ears hear nothing by sounds of winds roaring,
    And all is blackness.

                    III

Down courses in streams the sweat of emotion,
A dread trembling o'erwhelms me, paler than I
Than dried grass in autumn, and in my madness
    Dead I seem almost.

<P>
With the emendations by Mr. J.M. Edmonds, the reprinting of which he
has been kind enough to permit, a nearly literal rendering would be as
follows:
</P>

<P>
Some say that the fairest thing upon the dark earth is a host of
horsemen, and some say a host of foot soldiers, and others again
a fleet of ships, but for me it is my beloved. And it is easy to
make anyone understand this. When Helen saw the most beautiful of
mortals, she chose for best that one, the destroyer of all the honour
of Troy and though not much of child or dear parent, but was led
astray by Love, to bestow her heart far off, for woman is ever easy
to lead astray when she thinks of no account what is near and dear.
Even so, Anactoria, you do not remember, it seems, when she is with
you, one the gentle sound of whose footfall I would rather see than
all the chariots and mail-clad footmen of Lydia. I know that in this
world man cannot have the best; yet to pray for a part of
what was once shared is better than to forget it...
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
                 I

A troop of horse, the serried ranks of marchers,
A noble fleet, some think these of all on earth
Most beautiful. For me naught else regarding
    Is my beloved.

                 II

To understand this is for all most simple,
For thus gazing much on mortal perfectino
And knowing already what life could give her,
     Him chose fair Helen,

                 III

Him the betrayer of Ilium's honour.
The recked she not of adored child or parent,
But yielded to love, and forced by her passion,
     Dared Fate in exile.

                 IV

Thus quickly is bent the will of that woman
To whom things near and dear seem to be nothing.
So mightest thou fail, My Anactoria,
    If she were with you.

                 V

She whose gentle footfall and radiant face
Hold the power to charm more than a vision
Of chariots and the mail-clad battalions
    Of Lydia's army.

                 V

So must we learn in world made as this one
Man can never attain his greatest desire,
[But must pray for what good fortune Fate holdeth,
     Never unmindful.]

Athanaeus quotes this to show that there is not necessarily

the fragment is unfortunately too short for anything but a
literal translation. The breathing of the word in question
in Attic Greek would of course be rough.

<P>
The Scholist quotes this to show that Sappho says the same thing
of doves as Pindar (Pyth. 1-10) says of the eagle of Zeus.
</P>

<P>
Another reading is <TT>psau^kros</TT>, "light", for <TT>psu^xros</TT>,
"moist or chill."  The sense would then be "the spirit within
them became light and they relaxed their wings in rest."
