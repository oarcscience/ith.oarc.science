Hesiod lived in the 8th century BCE, probably
about the same time or shortly after Homer.
He refers to himself as a farmer in Boeotia, a region of central Greece,
but other than that we know little.
His poetry codified the chronology and
genealogy of the Greek myths.
<CITE>Works and Days</CITE> and
the <CITE>Theogony</CITE>
are the only two complete works we have of Hesiod,
other than the first few lines of a poem called
the <CITE>Shield of Heracles</CITE>.
</P>

<P>
In <CITE>Works and Days</CITE>
Hesiod divided time into five ages:--the Golden age, ruled by Cronos,
when people lived extremely long lives 'without sorrow of heart';
the Silver age, ruled by Zeus;
the Bronze age, an epoch of war;
the Heroic age, the time of the Trojan war;
and lastly the Iron age, the corrupt present.
This is similar to Hindu and Buddhist concepts of the Kali Yuga.
The idea of a Golden Age has likewise
had a profound impact on western thought.
<CITE>Works and Days</CITE> also discusses pagan ethics, extols hard work,
and lists lucky and unlucky days of the month for various activities.
</P>

<P>
The <CITE>Theogony</CITE> presents the descent of the gods,
and, along with <A HREF="../homer/index">the works of Homer</A>,
is one of the key source documents for Greek mythology;
it is the <A HREF="../../bib/kjv/gen">Genesis</A> of Greek mythology.
It gives the clearest presentation of the Greek pagan creation myth, starting
with the creatrix goddesses Chaos and Earth, from whom descended all the
gods and men; it mentions hundreds of individual gods, goddesses, demi-gods,
elementals and heroes.
