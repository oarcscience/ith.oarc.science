### 42. HIPPOCRATES OF CHIOS

<span class="smallcaps">Hippocrates</span> of <span
class="smallcaps">Chios</span> flourished during the latter half of the
fifth century B.C.

(<span class="smallcaps">Aeschylus</span> was the name of one of his
pupils).

He was the first to write a text-book of mathematics, called the
*Elements*. Parts of it were incorporated by Simplicius in his
Commentary on the *Physics* of Aristotle; but the work itself is lost.
