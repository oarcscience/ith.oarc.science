### 13. ANAXIMENES OF MILÊTUS

<span class="smallcaps">Anaximenes</span> Of <span
class="smallcaps">Milêtus</span> was in his prime about 546 B.C.

He wrote one book, in 'simple and unextravagant Ionic'. One whole
sentence only has survived.

1\. (*Paraphrase containing the word*) Loose. (= *rare*).

2\. As our soul, being air, holds us together, so do breath and air
surround the whole universe.

2a. (*The sun is broad*) like a leaf.

(*Spurious*)

3\. Air is near to the incorporeal; and since we come into being by an
efflux from this (*air*), it is bound to be both non-limited and rich so
that it never fails.
