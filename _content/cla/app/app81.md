### 86. HIPPIAS OF ÊLIS

<span class="smallcaps">Hippias</span> of <span
class="smallcaps">Êlis</span> was active in the second half of the fifth
century B.C.

Various writings are attributed to him, of which almost nothing
survives. He was probably the discoverer of the curve called
*quadratrix*, the construction of which is preserved in Proclus’
*Commentary on Euclid*. <span id="fr_108"></span>[2](#fn_101)

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

1\. (<span class="smallcaps">Pausanias</span>: *Hippias wrote the
elegiac inscription on the bronze statues of those who were drowned when
the boys’ choir was lost on the crossing between Messene and Rhegium*).

2\. (*From a work entitled 'Nomenclature of Tribes': mention of a tribe
called Spartoi*).

3\. (*List of victors at Olympia*).

4\. (*From a work entitled 'Collection': Thargêlia of Miletus
distinguished for beauty and wisdom, was married fourteen times*).

5\. (*Title: 'Trojan Dialogue'*).

*From unspecified writings*

6\. Some of these things may have been said by Orpheus some by Musaeus,
briefly in different places, some by Hesiod and Homer, others by others
of the poets, some in the prose writings of the Greeks. I have put
together the most important and homogeneous of these, and shall make
this speech of mine something new and variegated.

7\. (*Thales gave even inanimate objects a soul*).

8\. (*The continents Asia and Europe are called after two daughters of
Ocean*).

9\. (*The word 'tyrant' came into force later than Homer, who uses it to
mean 'king'*).

10\. (*Shortened form of 'deposit'*).

11\. (*Lycurgus, the Spartan lawgiver, was warlike and experienced in
many campaigns*).

12\. (*Mamercus, brother of Stesichorus the poet, acquired a reputation
for geometry*).

13\. (*There are seven Hyades*).

14\. (*The stepmother of Phrixus was called Gorgôpis*).

15\. (*There was an Ephyra at Elis*). <span
id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_102)

16\. (*There are two sorts of envy, one right, when one envies the bad
who are honoured, one wrong, when one envies the good*.

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

*Envious people have double sufferings: for their own troubles, and for
other people's good fortune*).

17\. (*'Calumny is a dread thing': no penalty is prescribed for it by
law, yet it is theft, for it steals friendship, best of possessions; so
that violence, bad as it is, is better than calumny, because it is not
concealed*).

18\. (*Homer came from Cymê*).

19\. (*The name 'Of Hippias' without title of work, in a papyrus*).

*Doubtful*

20\. (<span class="smallcaps">Aristotle</span>, *Poetics*, 1461a:
*Examples of difficulties solved by accentuation in Homer: attributed to
'Hippias of Thasos', perhaps by confusion*).

21\. (<span class="smallcaps">Proclus</span>, *Commentary in Euclid: the
quadratrices of Nicomedes and Hippias*).
