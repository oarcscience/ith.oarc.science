<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">I&ocirc;n</span> of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Chios</span> was active between 452 and 421 B.C.</p>  
<p>He wrote tragedies, lyrics and other poems; also a philosophical work in prose called <i>Triagmos</i> ('<i>Triad</i>') or <i>Triagmoi</i>.</p>  
<p>1. The beginning of my work is: everything is Three and nothing more or less than these three. The virtue of each thing is a Triad: intelligence, strength, luck.</p>  
<p>2. (<i>Pythagoras ascribed some of his writings to Orpheus</i>).</p>  
<p>3. Luck, that differs greatly from Art, creates many things that are like it.</p>  
<p>3a. (<i>The twenty-fifth letter is called Agma</i>).</p>  
<p>3b. (<i>Of men</i>) agreeing in their views and sharing the same libations.</p>  
<p>4. Thus Pherecydes, who was outstanding in manliness and reverence, even after death has a joyful life for his soul, if the wise Pythagoras had insight concerning all men and knew (<i>them</i>) thoroughly.</p>  
<p><i>Dubious fragment</i></p>  
<p>5. Eleven-stringed lyre, which hast a ten-intervalled range, for a triple melodious way of harmony, before thee the Hellenes used to play a lyre of seven strings with (<i>only</i>) a tetrachord, creating a thin music!</p>
