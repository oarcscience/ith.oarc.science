D&Ecirc;MOCRITUS OF ABD&Ecirc;RA</h3>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">D&ecirc;mocritus</span> of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Abd&ecirc;ra</span> was in his prime about 420 B.C.</p>  
<p>A large body of written work was produced at Abdera, during and after Democritus&#146; time. Thrasyllus, Roman scholar of the first century A.D., using the work of Alexandrian scholars, arranged these works in tetralogies, according to their subject-matter. Ethics (Tetralogies I and II); Natural Science (III to VI); Mathematics (VII to IX); Music (X and XI); and Technical Works (XII and XIII). There were also a group of treatises under the title <i>Causes</i>; a group of monographs on various subjects, the genuineness of which is suspect; a large number of Maxims; and a group of forged writings on magic.</p>

<p>3. The man who wishes to have serenity of spirit should not engage in many activities, either private or public, nor choose activities beyond his power and natural capacity. He must guard against this, so that when good fortune strikes him and leads him on to excess by means of (false) seeming, he must rate it low, and not attempt things beyond his powers. A reasonable fullness is better than overfullness.</p>

If a cone were cut by a plane parallel to the base,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_81"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> what ought one to think of the surfaces resulting from the section: are they equal or unequal? If they are unequal, they will make the cone have many steplike indentations and unevennesses; but if they are equal, the sections will be equal, and the cone will appear to have the same property as a cylinder, being made up of equal, not unequal, circles, which is most absurd.</p>

<p>163. (SEXTUS: <i>Democritus mentions Xeniades of Corinth</i>).</p>  
<p>164. Living creatures consort with their kind, as doves with doves, and cranes with cranes, and similarly with the rest of the animal world. So it is with inanimate things, as one can see with the sieving of seeds and with the pebbles on beaches. In the former, through the circulation of the sieve, beans are separated and ranged with beans, barley-grains with barley, and wheat with wheat; in the latter, with the motion of the wave, oval pebbles are driven to the same place as oval, and round to round, as if the similarity in these things had a sort of power over them which had brought them together.</p>  
<p>165. I say the following about the Whole . . . Man is that which we all know.</p>  
<p>166. (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sextus</span>: <i>Democritus said that</i>) certain images visit men (<i>some beneficent, some harmful. He prayed</i>) to meet with fortunate images.</p>  
<p>167. An eddy, of all manner of forms, is separated off from the Whole.</p>  
<p>168. (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Simplicius</span>: <i>The Democriteans called the atoms 'nature' . . . For they said that these were</i>) scattered about.</p>  
<p>169. Do not try to understand everything, lest you become ignorant of everything.</p>  
<p>170. Happiness, like unhappiness, is a property of the soul.</p>  
<p>171. Happiness does not dwell in flocks of cattle or in gold. The soul is the dwelling-place of the (<i>good and evil</i>) genius.</p>  
<p>172. Those same things from which we get good can also be for us a source of hurt, or else we can avoid the hurt. For instance, deep water is useful for many purposes, and yet again harmful; for there is danger of being drowned. A technique has therefore been invented: instruction in swimming.</p>  
<p>173. For mankind, evil comes out of what is good, if one does not know how to guide and drive correctly. It is not right to place such things in the category of evil, but in that of good. It is possible also to use what is good for an evil end&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_89"></A><A HREF="#fn_82"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> if one wishes.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_108"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 108</FONT></A></p>  
<p>174. The cheerful man, who is impelled towards works that are just and lawful, rejoices by day and by night, and is strong and free from care. But the man who neglects justice, and does not do what he ought, finds all such things disagreeable when he remembers any of them, and he is afraid and torments himself.</p>  
<p>175. But the gods are the givers of all good things, both in the past and now. They are not, however, the givers of things which are bad, harmful or non-beneficial, either in the past or now, but men themselves fall into these through blindness of mind and lack of sense.</p>  
<p>176. Chance is generous but unreliable. Nature, however, is self-sufficient. Therefore it is victorious, by means of its smaller but reliable (<i>power</i>) over the greater promise of hope.</p>  
<p>177. Neither can fine speech cover up base action, nor can good action be injured by calumny.</p>  
<p>178. Worst of all things is frivolity as the educator of youth, for it breeds those pleasures from which wickedness comes.</p>  
<p>179. If children are allowed not to work,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_90"></A><A HREF="#fn_83"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> they cannot learn letters or music or gymnastic, nor that which above all things embraces virtue, (<i>namely</i>) reverence. For it is precisely from these studies that reverence usually grows.</p>  
<p>180. Education is an ornament for the prosperous, a refuge for the unfortunate.</p>  
<p>181. The man who employs exhortation and persuasion will turn out to be a more effective guide to virtue than he who employs law and compulsion. For the man who is prevented by law from wrongdoing will probably do wrong in secret, whereas the man who is led towards duty by persuasion will probably not do anything untoward either secretly or openly. Therefore the man who acts rightly through understanding and knowledge becomes at the same time brave and upright.</p>  
<p>182. Beautiful objects are wrought by study through effort, but ugly things are reaped automatically without toil. For</p>

<p>even one who is unwilling is sometimes so wrought upon by learning (? <i>MSS. corrupt</i>).</p>  
<p>183. There is an intelligence of the young, and an un-intelligence of the aged. It is not time that teaches wisdom, but early training and natural endowment.</p>  
<p>184. Continuous association with base men increases a disposition to crime.</p>  
<p>185. The hopes of the educated are better than the wealth of the ignorant.</p>  
<p>186. Similarity of outlook creates friendship.</p>  
<p>187. It is right that men should value the soul rather than the body; for perfection of soul corrects the inferiority of the body, but physical strength without intelligence does nothing to improve the mind.</p>  
<p>188. The criterion of the advantageous and disadvantageous is enjoyment and lack of enjoyment.</p>  
<p>189. The best way for a man to lead his life is to have been as cheerful as possible and to have suffered as little as possible. This could happen if one did not seek one's pleasures in mortal things.</p>  
<p>190. One must avoid even speaking of evil deeds.</p>  
<p>191. Cheerfulness is created for men through moderation of enjoyment and harmoniousness of life. Things that are in excess or lacking are apt to change and cause great disturbance in the soul. Souls which are stirred by great divergences are neither stable nor cheerful. Therefore one must keep one's mind on what is attainable, and be content with what one has, paying little heed to things envied and admired, and not dwelling on them in one's mind. Rather must you consider the lives of those in distress, reflecting on their intense sufferings, in order that your own possessions and condition may seem great and enviable, and you may, by ceasing to desire more, cease to suffer in your soul. For he who admires those who have, and who are called happy by other mortals, and who dwells on them in his mind every hour, is constantly compelled to undertake something new and to run the risk, through</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_110"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 110</FONT></A></p>  
<p>his desire, of doing something irretrievable among those things which the laws prohibit. Hence one must not seek the latter, but must be content with the former, comparing one's own life with that of those in worse cases, and must consider oneself fortunate, reflecting on their sufferings, in being so much better off than they. If you keep to this way of thinking, you will live more serenely, and will expel those not-negligible curses in life, envy, jealousy and spite.</p>  
<p>192. It is easy to praise and blame what one should not, but both are the marks of a corrupt character.</p>  
<p>193. It is the business of intelligence to guard against a threatened injustice, but it is the mark of insensibility not to avenge it when it has happened.</p>  
<p>194. The great pleasures come from the contemplation of noble works.</p>  
<p>195. . . . Images conspicuous for their dress and ornament, empty of heart.</p>  
<p>196. Forgetfulness of one's own ills breeds boldness.</p>  
<p>197. Fools are shaped by the gifts of chance, but those who understand these things by the gifts of wisdom.</p>  
<p>198. The animal needing something knows how much it needs, the man does not.</p>  
<p>199. People are fools who hate life and yet wish to live through fear of Hades.</p>  
<p>200. People are fools who live without enjoyment of life.</p>  
<p>201. People are fools who yearn for long life without pleasure in long life.</p>  
<p>202. People are fools who yearn for what is absent, but neglect what they have even when it is more valuable than what has gone.</p>  
<p>203. Men who shun death pursue it.</p>  
<p>204. Fools cannot satisfy anyone in the whole of life.</p>  
<p>205. Fools long for life because they fear death.</p>  
<p>206. Fools want to live to be old because they fear death.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_111"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 111</FONT></A></p>  
<p>207. One should choose not every pleasure, but only that concerned with the beautiful.</p>  
<p>208. The self-control of the father is the greatest example for the children.</p>  
<p>209. For a self-sufficiency in food, there is never a 'short night'. (<i>i.e.</i> <i>those who have independence of means do not suffer from insomnia</i>).</p>  
<p>210. A rich table is provided by luck, but a sufficient one by wisdom.</p>  
<p>211. Moderation multiplies pleasures, and increases pleasure.</p>  
<p>212. Sleep in the daytime signifies bodily trouble or aberration of mind or laziness or lack of training.</p>  
<p>213. Courage minimises difficulties.</p>  
<p>214. The brave man is not only he who overcomes the enemy, but he who is stronger than pleasures. Some men are masters of cities, but are enslaved to women.</p>  
<p>215. The reward of justice is confidence of judgement and imperturbability, but the end of injustice is the fear of disaster.</p>  
<p>216. Imperturbable wisdom is worth everything.</p>  
<p>217. They alone are dear to the gods to whom crime is hateful.</p>  
<p>218. Riches derived from evil activity make the disgrace more conspicuous.</p>  
<p>219. The passion for wealth, unless limited by satisfaction, is far more painful than extreme poverty; for greater passions create greater needs.</p>  
<p>220. Evil gains bring loss of virtue.</p>  
<p>221. The hope of evil gains is the beginning of damage.</p>  
<p>222. The excessive accumulation of wealth for one's children is an excuse for covetousness, which thus displays its peculiar nature.</p>  
<p>223. The things needed by the body are available to all without toil and trouble. But the things which require toil</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_112"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 112</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and trouble and which make life disagreeable are not desired by the body but by the ill-constitution of the mind.</p>  
<p>224. The desire for more loses what one has, like the dog in Aesop.</p>  
<p>225. One should tell the truth, not speak at length.</p>  
<p>226. Freedom of speech is the sign of freedom; but the danger lies in discerning the right occasion.</p>  
<p>227. Misers have the fate of bees: they work as if they were going to live for ever.</p>  
<p>228. The children of misers, if they are reared in ignorance, are like those dancers who leap between swords: if they miss, in their leap downwards, a single place where they must plant their feet, they are destroyed. But it is hard to alight upon the one spot, because only the space for the feet is left. So too with the children of misers: if they miss the paternal character of carefulness and thrift, they are apt to be destroyed.</p>  
<p>229. Thrift and fasting are beneficial; so too is expenditure at the right time. But to recognise this is the function of a good man.</p>  
<p>230. The life without festival is a long road without an inn.</p>  
<p>231. The right-minded man is he who is not grieved by what he has not, but enjoys what he has.</p>  
<p>232. Of pleasures, those that come most rarely give the greatest enjoyment.</p>  
<p>233. If one oversteps the due measure, the most pleasurable things become most unpleasant.</p>  
<p>234. Men ask in their prayers for health from the gods, but do not know that the power to attain this lies in themselves; and by doing the opposite through lack of control, they themselves become the betrayers of their own health to their desires.</p>  
<p>235. All who derive their pleasures from the stomach, overstepping due season in eating or drinking or sexual pleasure, have pleasures that are but brief and short-lived, (that is), only while they are eating and drinking, but pains that are many. For this desire is always present for the same things,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_113"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 113</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and when people get what they desire, the pleasure passes quickly, and they have nothing good for themselves except a brief enjoyment; and then again the need for the same things returns.</p>  
<p>236. It is hard to fight desire; but to control it is the sign of a reasonable man.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>237. All bellicosity is foolish; for in studying the disadvantage of one's enemy, one loses sight of one's own advantage.</p>  
<p>238. The man who strives against the stronger ends in disgrace.</p>  
<p>239. Bad men, when they escape, do not keep the oaths which they make in time of stress.</p>  
<p>240. Toils undertaken willingly make the endurance of those done unwillingly easier.</p>  
<p>241. Continuous labour becomes easier through habit.</p>  
<p>242. More men become good through practice than by nature.</p>  
<p>243. All kinds of toil are pleasanter than rest, when men attain that for which they labour, or know that they will attain it. But whenever there is failure to attain, then labour is painful and hard.</p>  
<p>244. Do not say or do what is base, even when you are alone. Learn to feel shame in your own eyes much more than before others.</p>  
<p>245. The laws would not prevent each man from living according to his inclination, unless individuals harmed each other; for envy creates the beginning of strife.</p>  
<p>246. Life in a foreign country teaches self-sufficiency; for bread and bed are the sweetest cures for hunger and fatigue.</p>  
<p>247. To a wise man, the whole earth is open; for the native land of a good soul is the whole earth.</p>  
<p>248. The law wishes to benefit men's life; and it is able to do so, when they themselves wish to receive benefit; for it shows to those who obey it their own particular virtue.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_114"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 114</FONT></A></p>  
<p>249. Civil war is harmful to both parties; for both to the conquerors and the conquered, the destruction is the same.</p>  
<p>250. The greatest undertakings are carried through by means of concord, including wars between City-States: there is no other way.</p>  
<p>251. Poverty under democracy is as much to be preferred to so-called prosperity under an autocracy as freedom to slavery.</p>  
<p>252. One must give the highest importance to affairs of the State, that it may be well run; one must not pursue quarrels contrary to right, nor acquire a power contrary to the common good. The well-run State is the greatest protection, and contains all in itself; when this is safe, all is safe; when this is destroyed, all is destroyed.</p>  
<p>253. To good men, it is not advantageous that they should neglect their own affairs for other things; for their private affairs suffer. But if a man neglects public affairs, he is ill spoken of, even if he steals nothing and does no wrong. And if he is&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_92"></A><A HREF="#fn_85"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> negligent and does wrong, he is liable not only to be ill-spoken of but also to suffer bodily harm. To make mistakes is inevitable, but men find it hard to forgive.</p>  
<p>254. When base men enter upon office, the more unworthy they are, the more neglectful, and they are filled with folly and recklessness.</p>  
<p>255. When the powerful prevail upon themselves to lend to the indigent, and help them, and benefit them, herein at last is pity, and an end to isolation, and friendship, and mutual aid, and harmony among the citizens; and other blessings such as no man could enumerate.</p>  
<p>256. Justice is to do what should be done; injustice is to fail to do what should be done, and to put it aside.</p>  
<p>257. With certain animals, the rule for killing them or not stands thus: any that do wrong and wish to do so may be killed with impunity, and it conduces to well-being to do so rather than not do so.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_115"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 115</FONT></A></p>  
<p>258. One must at all costs kill all those creatures which do hurt contrary to justice. The man who does this has the greater share of cheerfulness(?) and justice and courage and property(?) in every ordered society (<i>than he who does not</i>).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_93"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>259. As has been laid down (<i>by me</i>) regarding beasts and reptiles which are inimical (<i>to man</i>), so I think one should do with regard to human beings: one should, according to ancestral law, kill an enemy of the State in every ordered society, unless a law forbids it. But there are prohibitions in every State: sacred law, treaties and oaths.</p>  
<p>260. Anyone killing any brigand or pirate shall be exempt from penalty, whether he do it by his own hand, or by instigation, or by vote.</p>  
<p>261. One must punish wrong-doers to the best of one's ability, and not neglect it. Such conduct is just and good, but the neglect of it is unjust and bad.</p>  
<p>262. Those who do what is deserving of exile or imprisonment or other punishment must be condemned and not let off. Whoever contrary to the law acquits a man, judging according to profit or pleasure, does wrong, and this is bound to be on his conscience.</p>  
<p>263. He has the greatest share of justice and virtue who awards the greatest offices (<i>honours?</i>) (<i>to the most deserving</i>).</p>  
<p>264. One must not respect the opinion of other men more than one's own; nor must one be more ready to do wrong if no one will know than if all will know. One must respect one's own opinion most, and this must stand as the law of one's soul, preventing one from doing anything improper.</p>  
<p>265. Men remember one's mistakes rather than one's successes. This is just; for as those who return a deposit do not deserve praise, whereas those who do not do so deserve blame and punishment, so with the official: he was elected not to make mistakes but to do things well.</p>  
<p>266. There is no means under the present constitution by which magistrates can be prevented from wrong-doing, however good they may be. For it is not likely for anyone else</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_116"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 116</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (<i>any more</i>) than for oneself, that he will show himself the same man in different circumstances.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_94"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> But we must also make arrangements to see that if a magistrate does no wrong, and convicts wrong-doers, he shall not fall under the power of the latter; rather, a law or some other means must defend the magistrate who does what is just.</p>  
<p>267. Rule belongs by nature to the stronger.</p>  
<p>268. Fear engenders flattery, but it has no good will.</p>  
<p>269. Courage is the beginning of action, but Fortune is the arbiter of the goal.</p>  
<p>270. Use slaves as parts of the body: each to his own function.</p>  
<p>271. A lover's reproach is dissolved by (<i>? corrupt word</i>).</p>  
<p>272. The man who is fortunate in his choice of a son-in-law gains a son; the man unfortunate in his choice loses his daughter also.</p>  
<p>273. A woman is far sharper than a man in malign thoughts.</p>  
<p>274. An adornment for a woman is lack of garrulity. Paucity of adornment is also beautiful.</p>  
<p>275. The rearing of children is full of pitfalls. Success is attended by strife and care, failure means grief beyond all others.</p>  
<p>276. I do not think that one should have children. I observe in the acquisition of children many great risks and many griefs, whereas a harvest is rare, and even when it exists, it is thin and poor.</p>  
<p>277. Whoever wants to have children should, in my opinion, choose them from the family of one of his friends. He will thus obtain a child such as he wishes, for he can select the kind he wants. And the one that seems fittest will be most likely to follow on his natural endowment. The difference is that in the latter way one can take one child out of many who is according to one's liking; but if one begets a child of one's own, the risks are many, for one is bound to accept him as he is.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_117"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 117</FONT></A></p>  
<p>278. For human beings it is one of the necessities of life to have children, arising from nature and primeval law. It is obvious in the other animals too: they all have offspring by nature, and not for the sake of any profit. And when they are born, the parents work and rear each as best they can and are anxious for them while they are small, and if anything happens to them, the parents are grieved. But for man it has now become an established belief that there should be also some advantage from the offspring.</p>  
<p>279. One should, as far as possible, divide out one's property among one's children, at the same time watching over them to see that they do nothing foolish when they have it in their hands. For they thus become much more thrifty over money, and more eager to acquire it and compete with one another. Payments made in a communal establishment do not irk so much as those in a private one, and the income gives much less satisfaction.</p>  
<p>280. It is possible without spending much of one's money to educate one's children, and (<i>so</i>) to build round their property and their persons a fortification and a safeguard.</p>  
<p>281. As among sores canker is the worst disease, so in property . . . (<i>end lost</i>).</p>  
<p>282. The employment of money with sense is useful towards liberality and justice, but with folly it is a continuous tax that maintains all and sundry (<i>? reading and meaning uncertain</i>).</p>  
<p>283. Poverty and wealth are terms for lack and superfluity; so that he who lacks is not wealthy, and he who does not lack is not poor.</p>  
<p>284. If your desires are not great, a little will seem much to you; for small appetite makes poverty equivalent to wealth.</p>  
<p>285. One should realise that human life is weak and brief and mixed with many cares and difficulties, in order that one may care only for moderate possessions, and that hardship may be measured by the standard of one's needs.</p>  
<p>286. He is fortunate who is happy with moderate means, unfortunate who is unhappy with great possessions.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_118"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 118</FONT></A></p>  
<p>287. Communal distress is harder than that of individuals; for there remains no hope of assistance.</p>  
<p>288. Disease of the home and of the life comes about in the same way as that of the body.</p>  
<p>289. It is unreasonableness not to submit to the necessary conditions of life.</p>  
<p>290. Cast forth uncontrollable grief from your benumbed soul by means of reason.</p>  
<p>291. To bear poverty well is the sign of a sensible man.</p>  
<p>292. The hopes of the unintelligent are senseless.</p>  
<p>293. Those to whom their neighbours' misfortunes give pleasure do not understand that the blows of fate are common to all; and also they lack cause for personal joy.</p>  
<p>294. The good things of youth are strength and beauty, but the flower of age is moderation.</p>  
<p>295. The old man has been young; but the young man cannot know if he will reach old age. Thus the perfected good is better than the uncertain future.</p>  
<p>296. Old age is a general mutilation. It possesses everything (<i>i.e.</i> <i>all the limbs and organs</i>), but they each lack something.</p>  
<p>297. Some men, not knowing about the dissolution of mortal nature, but acting on knowledge of the suffering in life, afflict the period of life with anxieties and fears, inventing false tales about the period after the end of life.</p>
