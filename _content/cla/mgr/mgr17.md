### BIBLIOGRAPHY

TILE translations from Homer in this book are taken from the *Iliad* by
Lang Leaf and Myers, and the translation of the *Odyssey* in verse by J.
W. Mackail. The translations of the *Homeric Hymns* are by Andrew Lang,
with the exception of the *Hymn to Athene*, which is by D. S. MacColl.
The translations of Euripides are by Professor Gilbert Murray. For the
remaining translations I am myself responsible.

Much assistance has been obtained of the following books, to which I
refer students for more detailed information:

1\. A. B. Cook: *Zeus: A Study of Ancient Religion*, 2 vols. (Cambridge
University Press, 1954.)

2\. Rendel Harris: *The Ascent of Olympus*. (Manchester University
Press, 1917.)

3\. Gilbert Murray: *Five Stages of Greek Religion*. (Oxford Clarendon
Press, 5925.)

4\. Jane E. Harrison: (a) *Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion*,
third edition. (b) *Themis*, second edition, 1927. (c) *Epilegomena to
the Study of Religion.* (Cambridge University Press.) (d) *Alpha and
Omega*. (Sidgwick and Jackson.)
