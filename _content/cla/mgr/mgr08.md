### ARTEMIS (DIANA)

Homer, in the *Odyssey*, adds a fourth to the Graces, the Gift-Givers,
Artemis. Penelope tells the story of the daughters of Pandareus:

"Their father and their mother dear died by the gods' high doom,  
The maidens were left orphans, alone within their home;  
Fair Aphrodite gave them curds and honey of the bee  
And lovely wine, and Hera made them very fair to see,  
And wise beyond all women-folk. And holy Artemis  
Made them to wax in stature, and Athena for their bliss  
Taught them all glorious handiworks of woman's artifice."

The activities of Artemis lie, indeed, as a rule, rather among plants
and animals and wild things generally than among human beings. There is,
however, one exception. In her aspect of the moon she watches over women
in childbirth.

Artemis, undoubtedly, like her brother Apollo, is a Northerner. She was
worshipped with the title of Queen in Thrace and in Pæonia, and it is
there that her aspect as moon-goddess is most clearly evident. There,
too, she has the title of Hekate, the Far-Darter, the feminine of Apollo
Hekatos. As Hekate, as moon-goddess, she has her dark and spectral side,
and is compact of magic and spells. Of this moon-magic of Artemis-Hekate
we have a wondrous picture in the second Idyll of Theocritus. Simætha,
slighted by her love and half-crazed with misery, invokes Hekate-Artemis
and tries to draw her lover back by the incantation of a wheel, to which
an *iynx*, a *wry-neck*, is bound. The incantation takes place by
moonlight. Simætha sings:

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

"Lo! now the barley smoulders in the flame,  
   Thestylis, wretch! thy wits are woolgathering!  
Am I a laughing stock to thee, a Shame?  
   Scatter the grain, I say, the while I sing;  
   'The bones of Delphis I am scattering;  
Bird, magic Bird, bring the man back to me.'

Next do I burn this wax, God helping me,  
So may the heart of Delphis melted be,  
   This brazen wheel I whirl, so as before  
   Restless may he be whirled about my door.  
'Bird, magic Bird, bring the man home to me.'

Next will I burn these husks. O Artemis,  
   Hast power hell's adamant to shatter down  
And every stubborn thing. Hark! Thestylis,  
   Hecate's hounds are baying up the town,  
   The goddess at the crossways. Clash the gong!  
   .     .      .      .      .      .      .      .  
Lo, now the sea is still. The winds are still.  
The ache within my heart is never still."

The moon has her frightening side, she stares down on man with her cold,
pitiless eye, a spectral terror charged with magic.

"Setebos, Setebos, and Setebos,  
 Thinketh He dwelleth in the cold of the moon."

But the moon has her gentler and fairer aspect. In the *Atalanta in
Calydon* the chorus sings:

"Come with bows bent and with emptying of quivers,  
   Maiden most perfect, lady of light,  
With a noise of winds and many rivers,  
   With a clamour of waters and with might;  
Bind on thy sandals, O thou most fleet,  
Over the splendour and speed of thy feet;  
For the faint east quickens, the wan west shivers,  
   Round the feet of the day and the feet of the night."

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

And this Artemis, when she [comes](errata.htm#2) to slay, slays gently,
mercifully. Homer, in the *Odyssey*, tells of a fair island, a goodly
land with oxen:

                 "With oxen and with sheep  
Well stored, and laden vines and cornfields deep,  
And hunger never comes upon the folk,  
Nor sore diseases that make mortals weep.  
But to the tribes of men, when old they grow  
Therein, the Archer of the silver bow,  
Apollo, comes with Artemis, and thus  
With shafts that hurt not strikes and lays them low."

Artemis is, of all the divine maidens, the most virginal. Perhaps
because she is a Northerner she attains an austerity impossible to the
warmer-blooded Southerners. While Athena refuses marriage, she is still,
in very human fashion, foster-mother, guardian, and friend to many a
hero. The relation of these early and husbandless matriarchal goddesses
to the male figures who attend them is one altogether noble and womanly,
though, perhaps, it is not what the modern mind regards as feminine. It
is a relation that halts somewhere halfway between mother and lover, and
has about it a touch of the patron-saint. These goddesses ask of the
hero whom they choose to inspire and protect, not that he should love
and adore, but that he should do great deeds. Such a relation is that of
Hera to Jason, of Athena to Perseus, to Herakles, to Theseus. And, as
the glory of the goddesses is in their heroes' high deeds, so their
grace is his guerdon. With the coming of patriarchal conditions this
high companionship ends; the women goddesses are sequestered to a
servile domesticity, they become abject and amorous. By Artemis alone
among the maidens this high companionship with heroes is all but
renounced. She dwells apart in lonely mountains and wild, untouched
forests. She is most of all the Lady-of-the-Wild-Things.

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

Accordingly the local cults of Artemis are not untainted by primitive
savagery. At Messene Pausanias was witness of a horrid ritual in honour
of Artemis Laphria. He tells us of "a hall of the Kuretes, where they
sacrifice without distinction all animals, beginning with oxen and goats
and ending with birds; they throw them all into the fire." The Kuretes,
we know, are ministrants of the Great Mother, to whom Artemis was near
akin. Pausanias again tells us, in detail, of the ritual of this Great
Mother at Hierapolis: "In the court of the sanctuary," he says, "were
kept all manner of beasts and birds, consecrated oxen, horses, eagles,
bears, and lions who never hurt anybody, but are holy and tame to
handle." But these tame, holy beasts were kept for a horrid holocaust,
which Lucian thus describes: "Of all the festivals the greatest that I
know of they hold at the beginning of the spring. At this festival they
do as follows. They cut down great trees and set them up in the
courtyard. Then they bring sheep and goats and other live beasts and
hang them upon the trees. They also bring birds and clothes and vessels
of gold and silver. When they have made all ready, they carry the
victims round the trees and set fire to them, and straightway they are
all burned."

Just such a holocaust was held in honour of Artemis at Patræ. After
describing the altar, surrounded by a circle of green logs of wood and
approached by an inclined plane made of earth, he tells of the
procession of the virgin priestess in a car drawn by deer. Of the
sacrifice itself, he says it was not merely a State affair, but popular
among private persons. "For they bring and cast upon the altar living
things of all sorts, both edible birds and all manner of victims, also
wild boars and deer and fawns, and some even bring the cubs of wolves
and bears, and others full-grown beasts. I saw, indeed, a bear and other
beasts struggling to get out of the first force of the flames and
escaping by sheer strength. But those who

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

threw them in dragged them up again on to the fire; I never heard of
anyone being wounded by the wild beasts."

Most horrible of all, among the Tauri, the local Artemis demanded human
blood. In later days the conscience of Greece revolted, and Euripides
makes Iphigeneia, doomed to sacrifice her brother, cry out against
Artemis:

"Herself doth drink the blood of slaughtered men?  
 Could ever Leto, she of the great King  
 Beloved, be mother of so gross a thing?  
 These tales be false, false as those feastlings wild  
 Of Tantalus and gods that love a child.  
 This land of murderers to its god hath given  
 Its own lust: evil dwelleth not in heaven."

It is a relief to turn from these savage ceremonials to a gentler aspect
of Artemis. On the Acropolis at Athens there was a precinct sacred to
Artemis of Brauron. This precinct must have seen strange sights. In it
was enacted the *arkteia* or bear-service. In one of the comedies of
Aristophanes the chorus of women tell how they were reared at the
expense of the State. The State wisely took them in hand early. "As soon
as I was seven years old I became an Errephoros, when I was ten I was
grinder to our Sovereign Lady, then, wearing the saffron robe, I was a
*bear* in the Brauronian festival." That Artemis herself in Arcadia was
a bear does not, perhaps, much surprise us, and Pausanias tells us that
one of her worshippers was turned into a bear. No doubt in rude Arcadia
the bear was a much-dreaded creature, whom it was wise to propitiate.
But to find, in the Christian era, at civilized Athens, a hear-cult is
not a little astounding, and shows strikingly how tenacious is ancient
tradition. We do not know the precise nature of the ritual, though we do
know that no well-born Athenian man dare marry a maiden unless she had
been consecrated as a bear to Artemis. Probably these little Athenian
girls, wrapped

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

in yellow bearskins, would dance and crouch bear-fashion before the
goddess Artemis, and the little girls were safe from marriage for the
ensuing year.

It would seem that after a time the Athenians got a little ashamed of
the rude ritual; a saffron robe was substituted for the bearskin, and
from the time of Aristophanes we hear more of the dedication of raiment
than of the dancing of bears. One maiden, we learn from an inscription
in the British Museum, offers a cloak of carded wool, another her
saffron robe, a third her mirror with an ivory handle. The list is a
long one, and the goddess, if she wore all the dedicated raiment, must
have had enough to put on. She was very gracious, and disdained nothing;
here and there some cloak or shawl is noted down as a "rag."

One girl, nameless, alas! but richer and more pious than the rest,
offered to the goddess an image of herself, a small stone bear. A
fragment of this image I had the good fortune to find when I first
visited Athens as I was turning over a heap of stone lumber. One furry
paw was stuck out and caught my eye. The small bear is crouching
comfortably on her hind paws. She must at one time have been set up in
the Brauronian precinct.

Among the Apaches to-day, we are told, "only ill-bred Americans or
Europeans would think of speaking of the Bear without employing the
reverential prefix *Ostin*, meaning Old One, the equivalent of
'Senator.'" Long after they were full-grown and married, these
well-born, well-bred little Athenians must have thought reverently of
the Great She-Bear.

The virginity of Artemis in her tenderest aspect makes her specially
gentle to the very young maiden. An epigram of the *Anthology* shows
this in very charming fashion. A young girl, Timaretê, dedicates to her
local Artemis, as Lady of the Lake, her clothes and her childish toys
before her marriage:

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

"Maid of the Mere, Timaretê here brings,  
   Before she weds, her cymbals, her dear ball;  
 To Thee, a Maid, her maiden offerings,  
   Her snood, her maiden dolls, their clothes and all.  
 Hold, Leto's child, above Timaretê  
 Thine hand and keep her virginal like thee."

Clearly here the maidenhood of the worshipper is mirrored in the
goddess. The play of words cannot be reproduced in English, as korê is
Greek for both maiden and doll.

The derivation of the name *Artemis* is not so clear as that of Hera or
Athena. It seems probable, however, though not quite certain, that the
goddess took her name from a healing herb much in use in antiquity, the
*artemisia* or mugwort, known also as the Mother of Herbs and as Tutsan
( = *tout saint*) or All Heal. The mugwort has fallen out of the modern
pharmacopoeia. In Parkinson's *Herbal* we are told that the mugwort or
wormwood possessed the power of dispelling demons; it was used in the
Midsummer ceremonials of St. John's Eve for making girdles, and was
called St. John's herb. The herb doctor, Culpepper, says that a hot
decoction of the herb was used to promote delivery and to remove
tumours. In a word, it was essentially a woman's medicine, and was
sometimes called *parthenium*. Another herbalist, Gerarde, notes from
Pliny that the mugwort "doth properly cure women's diseases." It is
specially noted that the mugwort grew in great profusion on Mount
Taygetos in Arcadia, the favourite hunting-ground of Artemis. A
manuscript of the eleventh century shows Artemis in the act of giving
the mugwort to the centaur Cheiron, the ancient physician who dwelt on
Mount Pelion in Thessaly. The reputation of the mugwort lasted on till
modern days. In the last century it was reported that a girl in Galloway
was near dying of consumption,

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

and all had despaired of her recovery, when a mermaid, who often gave
people good counsel, sang:

"Wad ye let the bonnie May die i’ your hand,  
 And the mugwort growing in the land?"

They immediately plucked the herb, gave her the juice of it, and she was
restored to health.

Whether, as Dr. Rendel Harris has supposed, Artemis actually got her
name from the *artemisia*, one thing is clear, the healing herb was
closely associated with her cult. This brings us to an interesting
aspect of her nature that has hitherto been too much neglected. Artemis,
like her twin-brother Apollo, was a healer. Apollo, Sophocles tells us,
had in the North an "ancient garden," and this garden, no doubt, was not
of flowers, but of healing herbs. Hekate, who was, as we have seen, but
the magical moon aspect of Artemis, had a similar garden, which Medea
the sorceress visited, and of which we have an account in the Orphic
*Argonautica*. It was shady with leaf-bearing trees, and in it grew many
a magic herb, black poppy, smilax, mandragora, aconite, and other
"baneful plants." In the *Hippolytus* of Euripides Artemis, all
huntress, is worshipped by the huntsman Hippolytus. In an ancient
treatise on hunting we are told that hunters must pay homage to Artemis
Agrotera, She-of-the-Wild. They must pour libation, sing hymns, and
offer firstfruits of the game taken, and they must crown the goddess. It
is pleasant to learn also that the hunters must crown their dogs, and
that dogs and huntsmen must feast together. But when Hippolytus comes to
pay this service to Artemis, to our surprise he finds her not as
Agrotera on the mountain or in the wilds of the forest, but in a garden
enclosed, a holy magical place. He thus invokes his goddess:

  "Mine own, my own desire,  
             Virgin most fair <span id="page_32">p. 32</span>  
        Of all the virgin choir,  
       Hail! O most pure, most perfect, loveliest one,  
         Lo! in my hand I bear,  
       Woven for the circling of thy long, gold hair,  
       Culled leaves and flowers from places which the sun  
          In spring long shines upon.  
  Where never shepherd hath driven flocks to graze,  
       Nor any grass is mown;  
But there sound through all the sunny sweet warm days,  
       Mid the green place,  
       The wild bees' wing alone.  
  And maiden reverence tends the fair things there,  
  And watereth all of them with sprinkled showers,  
      Whoso is chaste of spirit utterly  
  May gather there the leaves and fruit and flowers,--  
      The unchaste never.  
But thou, O goddess, and dearest love of mine,  
      Take and about thine hair  
      This anadem entwine  
      Take and for my sake wear."

Surely this holy place, this garden enclosed, was the herb-garden of
Artemis the Healer.
