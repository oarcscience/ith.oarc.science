With the emendations by Mr. J.M. Edmonds, the reprinting of which he has
been kind enough to permit, a nearly literal rendering would be as
follows:

Some say that the fairest thing upon the dark earth is a host of
horsemen, and some say a host of foot soldiers, and others again a fleet
of ships, but for me it is my beloved. And it is easy to make anyone
understand this. When Helen saw the most beautiful of mortals, she chose
for best that one, the destroyer of all the honour of Troy and though
not much of child or dear parent, but was led astray by Love, to bestow
her heart far off, for woman is ever easy to lead astray when she thinks
of no account what is near and dear. Even so, Anactoria, you do not
remember, it seems, when she is with you, one the gentle sound of whose
footfall I would rather see than all the chariots and mail-clad footmen
of Lydia. I know that in this world man cannot have the best; yet to
pray for a part of what was once shared is better than to forget it...

 

I

A troop of horse, the serried ranks of marchers,  
A noble fleet, some think these of all on earth  
Most beautiful. For me naught else regarding  
     Is my beloved.

II

To understand this is for all most simple,  
For thus gazing much on mortal perfectino  
And knowing already what life could give her,  
     Him chose fair Helen,

III

Him the betrayer of Ilium's honour.  
The recked she not of adored child or parent,  
But yielded to love, and forced by her passion,  
     Dared Fate in exile.

IV

Thus quickly is bent the will of that woman  
To whom things near and dear seem to be nothing.  
So mightest thou fail, My Anactoria,  
     If she were with you.

V

She whose gentle footfall and radiant face  
Hold the power to charm more than a vision  
Of chariots and the mail-clad battalions  
     Of Lydia's army.

V

So must we learn in world made as this one  
Man can never attain his greatest desire,  
\[But must pray for what good fortune Fate holdeth,  
     Never unmindful.\]
