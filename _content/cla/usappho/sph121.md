Himerius, apparently quoting, says "Thou are the evening star, of all
stars the fairest I think," and he says that the line comes from
Sappho's song to Hesperus. Again, he says, quoting: "Now thou didst
appear like that fairest of all stars; for the Athenians call thee,
Hesperus."

Himerius also refers to an ode which was apparently an imitation of the
work of Sappho. The ode has been transcribed by J.A. Symonds.
