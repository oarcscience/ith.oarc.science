ταισι \[δὲ\] ψῦχροσ μέν ἔγεντο θῦμοσ  
πὰρ δ᾽ ἴεισι τὰ πτέρα ... [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#23)

But the spirit within them turned chill and down dropped their wings.

The Scholist quotes this to show that Sappho says the same thing of
doves as Pindar (Pyth. 1-10) says of the eagle of Zeus.

Another reading is ψαῦκροσ [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#24) ,
"light", for ψῦχροσ [\[transcription\]](xlatall.htm#25) , "moist or
chill." The sense would then be "the spirit within them became light and
they relaxed their wings in rest."
