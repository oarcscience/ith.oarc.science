<p align="center"><i>Glycera. Thais</i></p>  
<p><i>Gly</i>. Thais, that Acarnanian soldier, who used to be so fond of Abrotonum, and then fell in love with me--he was decorated, and wore a military cloak--do you know the man I mean? I suppose you have forgotten him?</p>  
<p><i>Th</i>. Oh no, dear, I know; why, he shared our table last harvest festival. Well? you look as if you had something to tell me about him.</p>  
<p><i>Gly</i>. That wicked Gorgona (such a <i>friend</i> of mine, to be sure!)--she has stolen him away from me.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_53"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 53</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>Th</i>. What! he has given you up, and taken her in your place?</p>  
<p><i>Gly</i>. Yes, dear; isn't it <i>horrid</i> of her?</p>  
<p><i>Th</i>. Well, Glycera darling, it is wicked, of course; but it is not very surprising; it is what all we poor girls do. You mustn't be too much vexed; I shouldn't blame her, if I were you; Abrotonum never blamed you about him, you know; and you were friends, too. But <i>I</i> cannot think what he <i>finds</i> in her; where are his eyes? has he never found out how thin her hair is? what a lot of forehead she shows! and her lips! all livid; they might be a dead woman's; and that scraggy neck, veined all over; and what an amount of nose! I grant you she is tall and straight; and she has quite a nice smile.</p>  
<p><i>Gly</i>. Oh, Thais, you don't think it was her <i>looks</i> caught him. Don't you know? her mother Chrysarium is a witch; she knows Thessalian charms, and can draw down the moon; they do say she flies o' nights. It was she bewitched him with drugs in his drink, and now they are making their harvest out of him.</p>  
<p><i>Th</i>. Ah well, dear, you will get a harvest out of some one else; never mind him.</p>
