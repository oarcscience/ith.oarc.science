<p align="center">DORCAS (<i>Runs in)</i></p>  
<p>Oh, mistress, we are lost! We are lost! Polemon is back from the war. He was wearing a purple cloak and was surrounded by many slaves. I did not get the opportunity to speak to him in person because, as soon as they caught sight of him, his friends rushed up to greet him. But I noticed at his side a person who had accompanied him abroad; you know whom I mean. And I asked the latter person:</p>  
<p>"Tell me, Parmenon, have you got something for us? Has your master brought any worth-while gift from the war?"</p>  
<p align="center">PANNYCHIS</p>  
<p>That was wrong. You shouldn't have used such words. You should have said instead: "You are safe, praised be the gods, especially Dzeus Xenios and Athena Stratia! The mistress has asked me to inquire how your master has gotten along and if both of you</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_82"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 82</FONT></A></p>  
<p>are in good health." And it would have sounded even better if you had added: "She hasn't ceased weeping for Polemon and thinking about him." That would have been much better.</p>  
<p align="center">DORCAS</p>  
<p>Indeed, I did tell something like what you say as soon as I opened my mouth. But I didn't repeat my words, the exact words I used to Parmenon, because I wanted to warn you immediately what I have learned. When I came near Parmenon, I started this way:</p>  
<p>"Is it possible, Parmenon, that your own and your master's ears did not tingle all thru this war? For the mistress hasn't stopped talking about both of you. She has shed tears every day since you left. And whenever anybody returns from the battle area and there is news of a great fight and many are killed, she tears her hair and beats her breasts. Indeed, any kind of war news makes her lament."</p>  
<p align="center">PANNYCHIS</p>  
<p>Very good, Dorcas. You have spoken the right words.</p>  
<p align="center">DORCAS</p>  
<p>Then I asked about gifts and such matters, and he replied: "Dorcas, we return in full magnificence."</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_83"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 83</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center">PANNYCHIS</p>  
<p>He did not begin by saying that Polemon still remembers me and that he hopes to find me alive and awaiting him?</p>  
<p align="center">DORCAS</p>  
<p>In fact, Parmenon did mention several little things to that effect; but I found much more agreeable his account of his master's and his own good fortune. Parmenon spoke at length of great riches, of gold, fine raiments and slaves and ivory. It appears that they have so much money that they don't count it by pieces but by <i>medimnas</i>, and many are the <i>medimnas</i> they have brought along. Parmenon himself carries on his little finger a large polygonal ring in which is set a wonderful tri-colored stone.</p>  
<p>Before I left him, he tried to tell me how they had crossed the Halys and killed a certain Tiridates, and how Polemon distinguished himself in a fight against the Pisidians. I ran to you to announce their return so that you may have time to decide what to do. Should Polemon arrive and find Philostratos here, he will-----Can you imagine what he might do?</p>  
<p align="center">PANNYCHIS</p>  
<p>We must find some remedy for this queer situation. It would not be wise to desert Philostratos; he gave me</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_84"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 84</FONT></A></p>  
<p>six thousand drachmas the other day. And, besides, he is a merchant; he may give me much more later. On the other hand, I can not refuse to receive Polemon when he returns with so much money. One must respect old loves. This Polemon is so jealous a man, it was hard to put up with him when he was poor. I can imagine what he will be like after such a successful war.</p>  
<p align="center">DORCAS</p>  
<p>Here he comes!</p>  
<p align="center">PANNYCHIS</p>  
<p>Oh, I am powerless! What shall I do? I can not think of a way out. Invent something, please. Invent a story immediately! I tremble, Dorcas! I tremble!</p>  
<p align="center">DORCAS</p>  
<p>And there is Philostratos, too!</p>  
<p align="center">PANNYCHIS</p>  
<p>Oh, what will become of me! May the earth open its mouth and swallow me</p>  
<p align="center">PHILOSTRATOS (<i>Coming near</i>)</p>  
<p>I suggest we have a drink, dear Pannychis.</p>  
<p align="center">PANNYCHIS</p>  
<p>(<i>Low</i>) Oh, miserable man, you have ruined me! (<i>Loudly</i>) Hail, Polemon! Why didn't you return sooner?</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_85"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 85</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center">POLEMON</p>  
<p>Who is the man who dares to ask Pannychis to drink with him?</p>  
<p align="center">PANNYCHIS (<i>Silent</i>)</p>  
<p align="center">POLEMON</p>  
<p>You are silent. Very well. I have exerted myself to make the journey from Thermopylae to this city in five days' time in order to see this woman! Many thanks! I must have merited such a reception. From now on you are free to sponge on somebody else.</p>  
<p align="center">PHILOSTRATOS</p>  
<p>And you, friend, who are you?</p>  
<p align="center">POLEMON</p>  
<p>What! You haven't heard of Polemon of Steirieus, the Pandionide who was first a chiliarch and now commands his five thousand shields? Polemon, stranger, was the lover of this Pannychis when he still credited her with human feelings.</p>  
<p align="center">PHILOSTRATOS</p>  
<p>All right, my captain of mercenaries! Learn that Pannychis is mine. She has already received from me six thousand drachmas and will get more as soon as I sell my cargo. Come along, Pannychis. Let our valiant chiliarch disport himself with the Odrysians.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_86"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 86</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center">DORCAS</p>  
<p>My mistress is free. She will follow whomever she pleases</p>  
<p align="center">PANNYCHIS (<i>Low</i>)</p>  
<p>What shall I do, Dorcas?</p>  
<p align="center">DORCAS</p>  
<p>It is best to return inside. You can't remain near Polemon while he is in such a dudgeon. He will become even more jealous.</p>  
<p align="center">PANNYCHIS</p>  
<p>All right. Let us go in.</p>  
<p align="center">POLEMON</p>  
<p>I warn you that this is the last time you will drink together. It is not for play alone that I have survived so many a martial slaughter. I shall kill. My Thracians, Parmenon! Let the phalanx cut off this street from the rest of the metropolis! To the front, hoplites! Slingers and bowmen on the flanks! The rest to the rear of the column!</p>  
<p align="center">PHILOSTRATOS</p>  
<p>You think you are talking to children, mercenary. Do you believe you frighten us? Ah, what grand words! Indeed, have you ever killed a rooster? Where did you see war? You may have mounted guard over some safe rampart; possibly not even that.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_87"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 87</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center">POLEMON</p>  
<p>You will learn very soon where I saw war. Wait till you see us in arms!</p>  
<p align="center">PHILOSTRATOS</p>  
<p>Come on then! Bring on your phalanx! I and this faithful Tibios will show you what can be done with stones and oyster shells. We'll make you run so hard that you won't know the why or whither of your hurry.</p>
