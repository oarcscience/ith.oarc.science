<p><i>Her</i>. Mother, I am the most miserable god in Heaven.</p>  
<p><i>Ma</i>. Don't say such things, child.</p>  
<p><i>Her</i>. Am I to do all the work of Heaven with my own hands, to be hurried from one piece of drudgery to another, and never say a word? I have to get up early, sweep the dining-room, lay the cushions and put all to rights; then I have to wait on Zeus, and take his messages, up and down, all day long; and I am no sooner back again (no time for a wash) than I have to lay the table; and there was the nectar to pour out, too, till</p>

Leda's sons take turn and turn about betwixt Heaven and Hades--<i>I</i> have to be in both every day. And why should the sons of Alemena and Semele, paltry women, why should they feast at their ease, and I--the son of Maia, the grandson of Atlas--wait upon them? And now here am I only just back from Sidon, where he sent me to see after Europa, and before I am in breath again-off I must go to Argos, in quest of Danae, 'and you can take Boeotia on your way,' says father, 'and see Antiope.' I am half dead with it all. Mortal slaves are better off than I am: they have the chance of being sold to a new master; I wish I had the same!</p>  
<p><i>Ma</i>. Come, come, child. You must do as your father bids you, like a good boy. Run along now to Argos and Boeotia; don't loiter, or you will get a whipping. Lovers are apt to be hasty.</p>
