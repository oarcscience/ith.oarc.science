</p>  <h1 align="center">DIALOGUES OF THE GODS</h1>  <h3 align="center" align="center">XIX</h3>  
<p align="center"><i>Aphrodite</i>. <i>Eros</i></p>  
<p><i>Aph</i>. Eros, dear, you have had your victories over most of the Gods--Zeus, Posidon, Rhea, Apollo, nay, your own mother; how is it you make an exception for Athene? against her your torch has no fire, your quiver no arrows, your right hand no cunning.</p>  
<p><i>Eros</i>. I am afraid of her, mother; those awful flashing eyes! she is like a man, only worse. When I go against her with my arrow on the string, a toss of her plume frightens me; my hand shakes so that it drops the bow.</p>  
<p><i>Aph</i>. I should have thought Ares was more terrible still; but you disarmed and conquered him.</p>  
<p><i>Eros</i>. Ah, he is only too glad to have me; he calls me to him. Athene always eyes me so! once when I flew close past her, quite by accident, with my torch, 'If you come near me,' she called out, 'I swear by my father, I will run you through with my spear, or take you by the foot and drop you into Tartarus, or tear you in pieces with my own hands'--and more such dreadful things. And she has such a sour look; and then on her breast she wears that horrid face with the snaky hair; that frightens me worst of all; the nasty bogy--I run away directly I see it.</p>  
<p><i>Aph</i>. Well, well, you are afraid of Athene and the Gorgon; at least so you say, though you do not mind Zeus's thunderbolt</p>

<p>a bit. But why do you let the Muses go scot free? do <i>they</i> toss their plumes and hold out Gorgons' heads?</p>  
<p><i>Eros</i>. Ah, mother, they make me bashful; they are so grand, always studying and composing; I love to stand there listening to their music.</p>  
<p><i>Aph</i>. Let them pass too, because they are grand. And why do you never take a shot at Artemis?</p>  
<p><i>Eros</i>. Why, the great thing is that I cannot catch her; she is always over the hills and far away. But besides that, her heart is engaged already.</p>  
<p><i>Aph</i>. Where, child?</p>  
<p><i>Eros</i>. In hunting stags and fawns; she is so fleet, she catches them up, or else shoots them; she can think of nothing else. Her brother, now, though he is an archer too, and draws a good arrow--</p>  
<p><i>Aph</i>. I know, child, you have hit <i>him</i> often enough.</p>
