<p align="center"><i>Hephaestus. Zeus</i></p>  
<p><i>Heph</i>. What are your orders, Zeus? You sent for me, and here I am; with such an edge to my axe as would cleave a stone at one blow.</p>  
<p><i>Zeus</i>. Ah; that's right, Hephaestus. Just split my head in half, will you?</p>  
<p><i>Heph</i>. You think I am mad, perhaps?--Seriously, now, what can I do for you?</p>  
<p><i>Zeus</i>. What I say: crack my skull. Any insubordination,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_69"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 69</FONT></A></p>  
<p>now, and you shall taste my resentment; it will not be the first time. Come, a good lusty stroke, and quick about it. I am in the pangs of travail; my brain is in a whirl.</p>  
<p><i>Heph</i>. Mind you, the consequences may be serious: the axe is sharp, and will prove but a rough midwife.</p>  
<p><i>Zeus</i>. Hew away, and fear nothing. I know what I am about.</p>  
<p><i>Heph</i>. H&#8217;m. I don't like it: however, one must obey orders.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Why, what have we here? A maiden in full armour! This is no joke, Zeus. You might well be waspish, with this great girl growing up beneath your <i>pia mater</i>; in armour, too! You have been carrying a regular barracks on your shoulders all this time. So active too! See, she is dancing a war-dance, with shield and spear in full swing. She is like one inspired; and (what is more to the point) she is extremely pretty, and has come to marriageable years in these few minutes; those grey eyes, even, look well beneath a helmet. Zeus, I claim her as the fee for my midwifery.</p>  
<p><i>Zeus</i>. Impossible! She is determined to remain a maid for ever. Not that <i>I</i> have any objection, personally.</p>  
<p><i>Heph</i>. That is all I want. You can leave the rest to me. I'll carry her off this moment.</p>  
<p><i>Zeus</i>. Well, if you think it so easy. But I am sure it is a hopeless case.</p>
