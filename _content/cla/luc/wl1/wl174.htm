<p align="center"><i>Agamemnon. Ajax</i></p>  
<p><i>Ag</i>. If you went mad and wrought your own destruction, Ajax, in default of that you designed for us all, why put the blame on Odysseus? Why would you not vouchsafe him a look or a word, when he came to consult Tiresias that day? you stalked past your old comrade in arms as if he was beneath your notice.</p>  
<p><i>Aj</i>. Had I not good reason? My madness lies at the door of my solitary rival for the arms.</p>

<p><i>Ag</i>. Did you expect to be unopposed, and carry it over us all without a contest?</p>
