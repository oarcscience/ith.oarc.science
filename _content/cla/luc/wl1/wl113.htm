</p>  <h1 align="center">DIALOGUES OF THE GODS</h1>  <h3 align="center" align="center">I</h3>  
<p align="center"><i>Prometheus. Zeus</i></p>  
<p><i>Prom</i>. Release me, Zeus; I have suffered enough.</p>  
<p><i>Zeus</i>. Release you? you? Why, by rights your irons should be heavier, you should have the whole weight of Caucasus upon you, and instead of one, a dozen vultures, not just pecking at your liver, but scratching out your eyes. You made these abominable human creatures to vex us, you stole our fire, you invented women. I need not remind you how you overreached me about the meat-offerings; my portion, bones disguised in fat: yours, all the good.</p>  
<p><i>Prom</i>. And have I not been punished enough--riveted to the Caucasus all these years, feeding your bird (on which all worst curses light!) with my liver?</p>  
<p><i>Zeus</i>. &#8217;Tis not a tithe of your deserts.</p>  
<p><i>Prom</i>. Consider, I do not ask you to release me for nothing. I offer you information which is invaluable.</p>  
<p><i>Zeus</i>. Promethean wiles!</p>  
<p><i>Prom</i>. Wiles? to what end? you can find the Caucasus another time; and there are chains to be had, if you catch me cheating.</p>  
<p><i>Zeus</i>. Tell me first the nature of your 'invaluable' offer.</p>  
<p><i>Prom</i>. If I tell you your present errand right, will that convince you that I can prophesy too?</p>  
<p><i>Zeus</i>. Of course it will.</p>  
<p><i>Prom</i>. You are bound on a little visit to Thetis.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_63"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 63</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>Zeus</i>. Right so far. And the sequel? I trust you now.</p>  
<p><i>Prom</i>. Have no dealings with her, Zeus. As sure as Nereus's daughter conceives by you, your child shall mete you the measure you meted to--</p>  
<p><i>Zeus</i>. I shall lose my kingdom, you would say?</p>  
<p><i>Prom</i>. Avert it, Fate! I say only, that union portends this issue.</p>  
<p><i>Zeus</i>. Thetis, farewell! and for this Hephaestus shall set you free.</p>
