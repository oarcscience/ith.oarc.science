# DIALOGUES OF THE DEAD

### VIII

*Cnemon. Damnippus*

*Cne*. Why, ’tis the proverb fulfilled! The fawn hath taken the lion.

*Dam*. What's the matter, Cnemon?

*Cne*. The matter! I have been fooled, miserably fooled. I have passed
over all whom I should have liked to make my heirs, and left my money to
the wrong man.

*Dam*. How was that?

*Cne*. I had been speculating on the death of Hermolaus, the
millionaire. He had no children, and my attentions had been well
received by him. I thought it would be a good idea to let him know that
I had made my will in his favour, on the chance of its exciting his
emulation.

*Dam*. Yes; and Hermolaus?

*Cne*. What *his* will was, I don't know. I died suddenly,--the roof
came down about my ears; and now Hermolaus is my heir. The pike has
swallowed hook and bait.

*Dam*. And your anglership into the bargain. The pit that you digged for
other. . . .

*Cue*. That's about the truth of the matter, confound it.
