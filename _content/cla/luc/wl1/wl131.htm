<p align="center"><i>Apollo. Hermes</i></p>  
<p><i>Ap</i>. Hermes, have you any idea which of those two is Castor, and which is Pollux? I never can make out.</p>  
<p><i>Her</i>. It was Castor yesterday, and Pollux to-day.</p>  
<p><i>Ap</i>. How do you tell? They are exactly alike.</p>  
<p><i>Her</i>. Why, Pollux's face is scarred with the wounds he got in boxing; those that Amycus, the Bebrycian, gave him, when he was on that expedition with Jason, are particularly noticeable. Castor has no marks; his face is all right.</p>  
<p><i>Ap</i>. Good; I am glad I know that. Everything else is the same for both. Each has his half egg-shell, with the star on top, each his javelin and his white horse. I am always calling Pollux Castor, and Castor Pollux. And, by the way, why are they never both here together? Why should they be alternately gods and shades?</p>  
<p><i>Her</i>. That is their brotherly way. You see, it was decreed that one of the sons of Leda must die, and the other be immortal; and by this arrangement they split the immortality between them.</p>  
<p><i>Ap</i>. Rather a stupid way of doing it: if one of them is to be in Heaven, whilst the other is underground, they will never see one another at all; and I suppose that is just what they wanted to do. Then again: all the other gods practise some useful profession, either here or on earth; for instance, I am a prophet, Asclepius is a doctor, you are a first-rate gymnast and trainer, Artemis ushers children into the world; now what are these two going to do? surely two such great fellows are not to have a lazy time of it?</p>  
<p><i>Her</i>. Oh no. Their business is to wait upon Posidon, and ride the waves; and if they see a ship in distress, they go aboard of her, and save the crew.</p>  
<p><i>Ap</i>. A most humane profession.</p>
