<p align="center"><i>Eros. Zeus</i></p>  
<p><i>Eros</i>. You might let me off, Zeus! I suppose it <i>was</i> rather too bad of me; but there!--I am but a child; a wayward child.</p>  
<p><i>Zeus</i>. A child, and born before Iapetus was ever thought of? You bad old man! Just because you have no beard, and no white hairs, are you going to pass yourself off for a child?</p>  
<p><i>Eros</i>. Well, and what such mighty harm has the old man ever done you, that you should talk of chains?</p>  
<p><i>Zeus</i>. Ask your own guilty conscience, what harm. The pranks you have played me! Satyr, bull, swan, eagle, shower of gold,--I have been everything in my time; and I have you to thank for it. You never by any chance make the women in love with <i>me</i>; no one is ever smitten with <i>my</i> charms, that I have noticed. No, there must be magic in it always; I must be kept well out of sight. They like the bull or the swan well enough: but once let them set eyes on <i>me</i>, and they are frightened out of their lives.</p>  
<p><i>Eros</i>. Well, of course. They are but mortals; the sight of Zeus is too much for them.</p>  
<p><i>Zeus</i>. Then why are Branchus and Hyacinth so fond of Apollo?</p>

<p><i>Eros</i>. Daphne ran away from him, anyhow; in spite of his beautiful hair and his smooth chin. Now, shall I tell you the way to win hearts? Keep that aegis of yours quiet, and leave the thunderbolt at home; make yourself as smart as you can; curl your hair and tie it up with a bit of ribbon, get a purple cloak, and gold-bespangled shoes, and march forth to the music of flute and drum;--and see if you don't get a finer following than Dionysus, for all his Maenads.</p>  
<p><i>Zeus</i>. Pooh! I'll win no hearts on such terms.</p>  
<p><i>Eros</i>. Oh, in that case, don't fall in love. Nothing could be simpler.</p>  
<p><i>Zeus</i>. I dare say; but I like being in love, only I don't like all this fuss. Now mind; if I let you off, it is on this understanding.</p>
