<p align="center"><i>Menippus. Cerberus</i></p>  
<p><i>Me</i>. My dear coz--for Cerberus and Cynic are surely related through the dog--I adjure you by the Styx, tell me how Socrates behaved during the descent. A God like you can doubtless articulate instead of barking, if he chooses.</p>  
<p><i>Cer</i>. Well, while he was some way off, he seemed quite unshaken; and I thought he was bent on letting the people outside realize the fact too. Then he passed into the opening and saw the gloom; I at the same time gave him a touch of the hemlock, and a pull by the leg, as he was rather slow. Then he squalled like a baby, whimpered about his children, and, oh, I don't know what he didn't do.</p>  
<p><i>Me</i>. So <i>he</i> was one of the theorists, was he? His indifference was a sham?</p>  
<p><i>Cer</i>. Yes; it was only that he accepted the inevitable, and put a bold face on it, pretending to welcome the universal fate, by way of impressing the bystanders. All that sort are the same, I tell you--bold resolute fellows as far as the entrance; it is inside that the real test comes.</p>  
<p><i>Me</i>. What did you think of <i>my</i> performance?</p>

<p><i>Cer</i>. Ah, Menippus, you were the exception; you are a credit to the breed, and so was Diogenes before you. You two came in without any compulsion or pushing, of your own free will, with a laugh for yourselves and a curse for the rest.</p>
