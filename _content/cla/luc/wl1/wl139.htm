<p align="center"><i>Posidon. Dolphins</i></p>  
<p><i>Pos</i>. Well done, Dolphins!--humane as ever. Not content with your former exploit, when Ino leapt with Melicertes from the Scironian cliff, and you picked the boy up and conveyed him to the Isthmus, one of you swims from Methymna to Taenarum with this musician on his back, mantle and lyre and all. Those sailors had almost had their wicked will of him; but you were not going to stand that.</p>  
<p><i>Dol</i>. You need not be surprised to find us doing a good turn to a man, Posidon; we were men before we were fishes.</p>

He threw his minstrel's cloak about him, and sang a most sweet melody; and then he let himself drop into the water, never doubting but that his last moment had come. But I caught him up on my back, and swam to shore with him at Taenarum.</p>  
<p><i>Pos</i>. I am glad to find you a patron of the arts. This was handsome pay for a song.</p>
