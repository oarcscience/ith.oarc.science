# DIALOGUES OF THE DEAD

### IV

*Hermes. Charon*

*Her*. Ferryman, what do you say to settling up accounts? It will
prevent any unpleasantness later on.

*Ch*. Very good. It does save trouble to get these things straight.

*Her*. One anchor, to your order, five shillings.

*Ch*. That is a lot of money.

*Her*. So help me Pluto, it is what I had to pay. One rowlock-strap,
fourpence.

*Ch*. Five and four; put that down.

*Her*. Then there was a needle, for mending the sail; tenpence.

*Ch*. Down with it.

*Her*. Caulking-wax; nails; and cord for the brace. Two shillings the
lot.

*Ch*. They were worth the money.

*Her*. That's all; unless I have forgotten anything. When will you pay
it?

*Ch*. I can't just now, Hermes; we shall have a war or a plague
presently, and then the passengers will come shoaling in, and I shall be
able to make a little by jobbing the fares.

*Her*. So for the present I have nothing to do but sit down, and pray
for the worst, as my only chance of getting paid?

*Ch*. There is nothing else for it;--very little business doing just
now, as you see, owing to the peace.

*Her*. That is just as well, though it does keep me waiting for my
money. After all, though, Charon, in old days men were men; you remember
the state they used to come down in,--all blood and wounds generally.
Nowadays, a man is poisoned by his slave or his wife; or gets dropsy
from overfeeding; a pale, spiritless lot, nothing like the men of old.
Most of them seem to meet their end in some plot that has money for its
object.

*Ch*. Ah; money is in great request.

*Her*. Yes; you can't blame me if I am somewhat urgent for payment.

F.
