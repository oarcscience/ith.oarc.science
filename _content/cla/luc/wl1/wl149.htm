<p align="center"><i>Hermes. Charon</i></p>  
<p><i>Her</i>. Ferryman, what do you say to settling up accounts? It will prevent any unpleasantness later on.</p>  
<p><i>Ch</i>. Very good. It does save trouble to get these things straight.</p>  
<p><i>Her</i>. One anchor, to your order, five shillings.</p>  
<p><i>Ch</i>. That is a lot of money.</p>  
<p><i>Her</i>. So help me Pluto, it is what I had to pay. One rowlock-strap, fourpence.</p>  
<p><i>Ch</i>. Five and four; put that down.</p>  
<p><i>Her</i>. Then there was a needle, for mending the sail; tenpence.</p>  
<p><i>Ch</i>. Down with it.</p>  
<p><i>Her</i>. Caulking-wax; nails; and cord for the brace. Two shillings the lot.</p>  
<p><i>Ch</i>. They were worth the money.</p>  
<p><i>Her</i>. That's all; unless I have forgotten anything. When will you pay it?</p>  
<p><i>Ch</i>. I can't just now, Hermes; we shall have a war or a plague presently, and then the passengers will come shoaling in, and I shall be able to make a little by jobbing the fares.</p>

<p><i>Her</i>. So for the present I have nothing to do but sit down, and pray for the worst, as my only chance of getting paid?</p>  
<p><i>Ch</i>. There is nothing else for it;--very little business doing just now, as you see, owing to the peace.</p>  
<p><i>Her</i>. That is just as well, though it does keep me waiting for my money. After all, though, Charon, in old days men were men; you remember the state they used to come down in,--all blood and wounds generally. Nowadays, a man is poisoned by his slave or his wife; or gets dropsy from overfeeding; a pale, spiritless lot, nothing like the men of old. Most of them seem to meet their end in some plot that has money for its object.</p>  
<p><i>Ch</i>. Ah; money is in great request.</p>  
<p><i>Her</i>. Yes; you can't blame me if I am somewhat urgent for payment.</p>
