# DIALOGUES OF THE DEAD

### XXVI

*Menippus. Chiron*

*Me*. I have heard that you were a god, Chiron, and that you died of
your own choice?

*Chi*. You were rightly informed. I am dead, as you see, and might have
been immortal.

*Me*. And what should possess you, to be in love with Death? He has no
charm for most people.

*Chi*. You are a sensible fellow; I will tell you. There was no further
satisfaction to be had from immortality.

*Me*. Was it not a pleasure merely to live and see the light?

*Chi*. No; it is variety, as I take it, and not monotony, that
constitutes pleasure. Living on and on, everything always the same; sun,
light, food, spring, summer, autumn, winter, one thing following another
in unending sequence,--I sickened of it all. I found that enjoyment lay
not in continual possession; that deprivation had its share therein.

*Me*. Very true, Chiron. And how have you got on since you made Hades
your home?

*Chi*. Not unpleasantly. I like the truly republican equality that
prevails; and as to whether one is in light or darkness, that makes no
difference at all. Then again there is no hunger or thirst here; one is
independent of such things.

*Me*. Take care, Chiron! You may be caught in the snare of your own
reasonings.

*Chi*. How should that be?

*Me*. Why, if the monotony of the other world brought on satiety, the
monotony here may do the same. You will have to look about for a further
change, and I fancy there is no third life procurable.

*Chi*. Then what is to be done, Menippus?

*Me*. Take things as you find them, I suppose, like a sensible fellow,
and make the best of everything.

F.
