<p align="center"><i>Nireus. Thersites. Menippus</i></p>  
<p><i>Ni</i>. Here we are; Menippus shall award the palm of beauty. Menippus, am I not better-looking than he?</p>  
<p><i>Me</i>. Well, who are you? I must know that first, mustn't I?</p>  
<p><i>Ni</i>. Nireus and Thersites.</p>  
<p><i>Me</i>. Which is which? I cannot tell that yet.</p>  
<p><i>Ther</i>. One to me; I am like you; you have no such superiority as Homer (blind, by the way) gave you when he called you the handsomest of men; he might peak my head and thin my hair, our judge finds me none the worse. Now, Menippus, make up your mind which is handsomer.</p>  
<p><i>Ni</i>. I, of course, I, the son of Aglaia and Charopus,</p>  
<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">Comeliest of all that came &#8217;neath Trojan walls.</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p><i>Me</i>. But not comeliest of all that come &#8217;neath the earth, as far as I know. Your bones are much like other people's; and the only difference between your two skulls is that yours would not take much to stove it in. It is a tender article, something short of masculine.</p>  
<p><i>Ni</i>. Ask Homer what I was, when I sailed with the Achaeans.</p>  
<p><i>Me</i>. Dreams, dreams. I am looking at what you are; what you were is ancient history.</p>  
<p><i>Ni</i>. Am I not handsomer here, Menippus?</p>  
<p><i>Me</i>. You are not handsome at all, nor any one else either. Hades is a democracy; one man is as good as another here.</p>  
<p><i>Ther</i>. And a very tolerable arrangement too, if you ask me.</p>
