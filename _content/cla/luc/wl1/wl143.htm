<p align="center"><i>Doris. Thetis</i></p>  
<p><i>Dor</i>. Crying, dear?</p>  
<p><i>The</i>. Oh, Doris, I have just seen a lovely girl thrown into a chest by her father, and her little baby with her; and he gave the chest to some sailors, and told them, as soon as they were far enough from the shore, to drop it into the water; he meant them to be drowned, poor things.</p>  
<p><i>Dor</i>. Oh, sister, but why? What was it all about? Did you hear?</p>  
<p><i>The</i>. Her father, Acrisius, wanted to keep her from marrying. And, as she was so pretty, he shut her up in an iron room. And--I don't know whether it's true--but they say that Zeus turned himself into gold, and came showering down through the roof, and she caught the gold in her lap,--and it was Zeus all the time. And then her father found out about it--he is a horrid, jealous old man--and he was furious, and thought she had been receiving a lover; and he put her into the chest, the moment the child was born.</p>  
<p><i>Dor</i>. And what did she do then?</p>  
<p><i>The</i>. She never said a word against her own sentence; <i>she</i> was ready to submit: but she pleaded hard for the child's life, and cried, and held him up for his grandfather to see; and there was the sweet babe, that thought no harm, smiling at the waves. I am beginning again, at the mere remembrance of it.</p>  
<p><i>Dor</i>. You make me cry, too. And is it all over?</p>  
<p><i>The</i>. No; the chest has carried them safely so far; it is by Seriphus.</p>  
<p><i>Dor</i>. Then why should we not save them? We can put the</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_103"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 103</FONT></A></p>  
<p>chest into those fishermen's nets, look; and then of course they will be hauled in, and come safe to shore.</p>  
<p><i>The</i>. The very thing. She shall not die; nor the child, sweet treasure!</p>
