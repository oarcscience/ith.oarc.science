# DIALOGUES OF THE DEAD

### VII

*Zenophantus. Callidemides*

*Ze*. Ah, Callidemides, and how did *you* come by your end? As for me, I
was free of Dinias's table, and there died of a surfeit; but that is
stale news; you were there, of course.

*Cal*. Yes, I was. Now there was an element of surprise about *my* fate.
I suppose you know that old Ptoeodorus?

*Ze*. The rich man with no children, to whom you gave most of your
company?

*Cal*. That is the man; he had promised to leave me his heir, and I used
to show my appreciation. However, it went on such a time; Tithonus was a
juvenile to him; so I found a short cut to my property. I bought a
potion, and agreed with the butler that next time his master called for
wine (he is a pretty stiff drinker) he should have this ready in a cup
and present it; and I was pledged to reward the man with his freedom.

*Ze*. And what happened? this is interesting.

*Cal*. When we came from bath, the young fellow had two cups ready, one
with the poison for Ptoeodorus, and the other for me; but by some
blunder he handed me the poisoned cup,

and Ptoeodorus the plain; and behold, before he had done drinking, there
was I sprawling on the ground, a vicarious corpse! Why are you laughing
so, Zenophantus? I am your friend; such mirth is unseemly.

*Ze*. Well, it was such a humorous exit. And how did the old man behave?

*Cal*. He was dreadfully distressed for the moment; then he saw, I
suppose, and laughed as much as you over the butler's trick.

*Ze*. Ah, short cuts are no better for you than for other people, you
see; the high road would have been safer, if not quite so quick.
