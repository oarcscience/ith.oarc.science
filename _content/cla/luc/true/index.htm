Widely hailed as the first science fiction story,
<CITE>A True Story</CITE>, by Lucian
of Samosata is a voyage to the edges of the universe and reason.
The title is the first clue that this will be a tall tale.
As much a predecessor of
<A HREF="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0517226952/internetsacredte">Douglas Adams</A>
as Jules Verne, Lucian's fantasy
explores not only outer space (where he brokers war and peace between
the inhabitants of the sun and moon), but also the Elysian fields,
the geography of the Odyssey, and the interior of a giant whale.
We get to meet Homer, Pythagoras, Socrates, and other immortals, as well as a host
of bizarre creatures.
The text is riddled with
puns, innuendo, parody and satire; however most of this humor will escape
the modern reader.
Suffice it to say that this was considered pretty
funny in the second century C.E.
The narrative breaks off in the second book.
Whether there were more adventures
or Lucian just ran out of ideas is unknown.</P>

<P>This edition includes the English translation of A.M. Harmon,
published as part of volume I of the Loeb Classical Library edition of Lucian.
It has parallel Greek text on a page by page basis.
Each of the two books is about 250 kilobytes, so they may take awhile to
load on a slow connection.
If you have trouble viewing the Greek text in your browser,
you should refer to sacred-texts'
<A HREF="../../../unicode">Unicode troubleshooting page</A>.

Lucian also wrote another proto-science-fictional piece,
<A HREF="../wl3/wl309">Icaromenippus, an Aerial Expedition</A>,
available at this site in the Fowler and Fowler translation.
