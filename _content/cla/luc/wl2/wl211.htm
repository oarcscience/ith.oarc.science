<p>ATHLETES and physical trainers do not limit their attention to the questions of perfect condition and exercise; they say there is a time for relaxation also--which indeed they represent as the most important element in training. I hold it equally true for literary men that after severe study they should unbend the intellect, if it is to come perfectly efficient to its next task.</p>  
<p>The rest they want will best be found in a course of literature<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="136:2">2</A></FONT></span> which does not offer entertainment pure and simple, depending on mere wit or felicity, but is also capable of stirring an educated curiosity--in a way which I hope will be exemplified in the following pages. They are intended to have an attraction independent of any originality of subject, any happiness of general design, any verisimilitude in the piling up of fictions. This attraction is in the veiled reference underlying all the details of my narrative; they parody the cock-and-bull stories of ancient poets, historians, and philosophers; I have only refrained from adding a key because I could rely upon you to recognize as you read.</p>

<p>its characteristics, gives details for which he had neither the evidence of his eyes nor of hearsay. Iambulus's <i>Oceanica</i> is full of marvels; the whole thing is a manifest fiction, but at the same time pleasant reading. Many other writers have adopted the same plan, professing to relate their own travels, and describing monstrous beasts, savages, and strange ways of life. The fount and inspiration of their humour is the Homeric Odysseus, entertaining Alcinous's court with his prisoned winds, his men one-eyed or wild or cannibal, his beasts with many heads, and his metamorphosed comrades; the Phaeacians were simple folk, and he fooled them to the top of their bent.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="137:4">4</A></FONT></span>When I come across a writer of this sort, I do not much mind his lying; the practice is much too well established for that, even with professed philosophers; I am only surprised at his expecting to escape detection. Now I am myself vain enough to cherish the hope of bequeathing something to posterity; I see no reason for resigning my right to that inventive freedom which others enjoy; and, as I have no truth to put on record, having lived a very humdrum life, I fall back on falsehood--but falsehood of a more consistent variety; for I now make the only true statement you are to expect--that I am a liar. This confession is, I consider, a full defence against all imputations. My subject is, then, what I have neither seen, experienced, nor been told, what neither exists nor could conceivably do so. I humbly solicit my readers' incredulity.</p>
