<P>Lucian of Samosata was a writer known for his satire.
He was born in what is now eastern Turkey, in Samosata, about 120 C.E.
Samosata was located in the ancient Roman province of Syria
(not to be confused with the modern country);
the site was recently inundated by the Atat&uuml;rk Dam.
Lucian was trained as a rhetorician (somewhat like a trial attorney).
However, he made a living as an itinerant lecturer.
Lucian traveled widely, as far as Greece, Italy and Gaul.
He died in Athens, about 180 C.E.
Over eighty works, written in Greek,
are attributed to him, some probably spuriously.
The best known of his works, <CITE>A True Story</CITE>, is considered
to be one of the first science fiction stories.
