<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE SYMBOLIC RING</H3>
<P>Travelers coming from Sardis speak of the necklaces and precious stones with which the Lydian women deck themselves, from the tops of their tresses to their tinted feet.</P>
<P>The young girls of my country have neither bracelets nor diadems, but their fingers bear a silver ring, upon the scroll of which the triangle of the goddess is engraved.</P>
<P>When they turn the apex outward, it signifies; "Psyche to be taken." And, when they turn it inward: "Psyche taken."</P>
<P>The men believe in it, the women don't. As for myself, I scarcely notice the direction of the apex, for Psyche is an easy catch. She is always to be taken.</P>
