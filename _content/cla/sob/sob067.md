### SHADOWLIGHT

We slipped beneath the transparent coverlet of wool, she and I. Even our
heads were hidden, and the lamp lit up the cloth above us.

And thus I saw her dear body in a mysterious glow. We were much closer
to each other, freer, more naked and more intimate. "In the selfsame
shift," she said to me.

We left our hair done up so that we'd be more bare, and in the close air
of the bed two female odors rose, as from two natural censers.

Nothing in the world, not even the lamp, saw us that night. And which of
us was loved and which the lover, she and I alone can ever tell. But the
men shall never know a thing about it.
