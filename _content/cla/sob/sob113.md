### DOMESTICITY

Four slaves watch my house: two robust Thracians at the door, a Sicilian
in the kitchen, and a docile Phrygian mute at my bed.

The two Thracians are handsome men. They have sticks in their hands with
which to chase poor lovers, and a hammer to nail upon the wall the
garlands which are sent to me.

The Sicilian is a rare cook; I paid twelve minae for him. No other cook
knows how to prepare fried croquettes and poppy-cakes as he does.

The Phrygian bathes me, coifs me, plucks my hair. She sleeps in my room
each morning, and three nights of each month she takes my place beside
my lovers.
