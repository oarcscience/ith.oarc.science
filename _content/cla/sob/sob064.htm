<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE DOLL</H3>
<P>I have given her a doll, a waxen doll with rosy cheeks. Its arms are attached by little pins, and even its little legs can bend.</P>
<P>When we are together she places it between us in the bed; it is our child. At eventide she rocks it and gives it the breast before putting it to sleep.</P>
<P>She has woven it three little tunics, and on the Aphrodisian days we give it little jewels, jewels and also flowers.</P>
<P>She is careful of its virtue, and will not let it out alone; especially in the sun, for the little doll would melt and drip away in drops of wax.</P>
