<P>She entered, and passionately, with half-closed eyes, she joined her lips with mine, and our tongues knew each other. . . Never in my life had there been a kiss like that.</P>
<P>She stood against me, amorous and willing. Little by little my knee rose between her warm thighs, which spread as though receptive to a lover.</P>
<P>My wandering hand upon her gown sought her secret body, which alternately swayed in undulation, or arching, stiffened with tremblings of the skin.</P>
<P>With maddened eyes she looked upon the bed; but we had no right to love before the wedding, and we separated hastily at last.</P>
