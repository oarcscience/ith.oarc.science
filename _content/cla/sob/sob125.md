### THE COMMAND

"Hear me, old girl. In three days I shall give a festival. I must have a
novel entertainment, You will rent me all your girls. How many have you,
and say, what can they do?"

"--I have seven. Three dance the kordax with the scarf and phallos.
Nephele of the glossy armpits will imitate the love of doves between her
rosy breasts.

A singer in a broidered peplos will sing the songs of Rhodes,
accompanied by flute-blowers with myrtle-garlands twined about their
chestnut limbs."

--That's well. Have them freshly shaven, bathed and perfumed from head
to foot, ready for other games should they be asked. Go give my orders.
Farewell."
