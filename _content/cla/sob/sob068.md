### THE SLEEPER

She sleeps in her undone hair, her hands entwined behind her neck. But
does she dream? Her lips are parted and her breath is gentle.

With a little dab of down I dry, without awakening her, the perspiration
from her arms, the fever from her cheeks. Her closed eyelids are two
purple flowers.

I shall arise quietly; I'll go draw water, milk the cow, and beg some
fire from our neighbors. I want to be coiffed and dressed completely
when she opens her eyes.

Sleep, remain awhile between her lovely curving lashes, and spin out the
happy night with a dream of happy omen.
