### CONFIDENCES

The next day I went to visit her, and we blushed the moment that we saw
each other. She had me come into her private room, that we might be
alone.

I had many things to tell her; but when I saw her I forgot them all. I
did not even dare to throw myself upon her neck, I looked at her high
girdle.

I was astonished that her face remained the same, she still seemed to be
my friend; and yet, since the night before, she had learned so many
things that maddened me.

Suddenly I sat upon her knees, I took her in my arms and whispered
wildly in her ear, most anxiously. She put her cheek to mine and told me
all.
