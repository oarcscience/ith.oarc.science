<P>In the thrice mysterious hall where men have never entered, we have f&ecirc;ted you, Astarte of the Night. Mother of the World, Well-Spring of the life of all the Gods!</P>
<P>I shall reveal a portion of the rite, but no more of it than is permissible. About a crowned Phallos, a hundred-twenty women swayed and cried. The initiates were dressed as men, the others in the split tunic.</P>
<P>The fumes of perfumes and the smoke of torches floated fog-like in and out among us all. I wept my scorching tears. All, at the feet of Berbeia, we threw ourselves, extended on our backs.</P>
<P>Then, when the Religious Act was consummated, and when into the Holy Triangle the purpled phallos had been plunged anew, the mysteries began; but I shall say no more.</P>
