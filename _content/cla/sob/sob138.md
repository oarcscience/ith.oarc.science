### INFORMATION

If you should like, oh! halting passer-by, slim thighs and high-strung
flanks, a hard, strong throat and knees which clasp, go seek out Plango,
she who is my friend.

If you are looking for a laughing girl with round luxurious breasts, a
fragile build, plump buttocks and lovely hollowed flanks, go to the
corner of this street where Spidhorodellis has her domicile.

But if long tranquil hours in a courtesan's arms, her soft skin, the
belly's warmth and odor of her tresses pleases you, go look for Milto,
you will be satisfied.

But do not expect much love; profit by her experience. One can ask
everything of a woman, when she is nude, when it is night and a hundred
drachmae lie upon the hearth.
