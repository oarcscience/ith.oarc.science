### INTERRUPTED SLEEP

I fell asleep alone like a partridge in the heath. . . . The light
breeze, the noise of the water and the softness of the night had held me
there.

I had fallen asleep, imprudently, and I awoke with a scream, and I
struggled and I wept; but it was too late already. What service are a
child's hands?

He would not leave me. Nay, he clasped me more fondly in his arms,
pressed me against him and I saw no more, nor earth nor trees but only
the glowing fire in his eyes.

To you, victorious Kypris, I consecrate these offerings, still moist
with dew, vestiges of the anguish of a maid, witnesses of my slumber and
my struggle.
