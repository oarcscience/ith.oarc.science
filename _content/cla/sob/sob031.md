### THE DISTAFF

All day my mother has shut me in the women's rooms, together with my
sisters whom I loathe, who speak among themselves in lowered voice. In
my own little corner, far away, I ply my distaff.

Distaff dear, since I'm alone with you, 'tis you alone who'll be my
confidante. Your worsted wig of white makes you a woman. Hear me.

If I were able I should not be here, seated in the shadow of the wall
and spinning boredly: I should be lain in violets upon the slopes of
Tauros.

Since he is not as rich as I, my mother will not let him marry me. But
let me tell you; either I will die before my wedding day; or he will be
the one to lead me out. . .
