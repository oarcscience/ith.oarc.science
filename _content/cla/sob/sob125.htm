<P>"Hear me, old girl. In three days I shall give a festival. I must have a novel entertainment, You will rent me all your girls. How many have you, and say, what can they do?"</P>
<P>"--I have seven. Three dance the kordax with the scarf and phallos. Nephele of the glossy armpits will imitate the love of doves between her rosy breasts.</P>
<P>A singer in a broidered peplos will sing the songs of Rhodes, accompanied by flute-blowers with myrtle-garlands twined about their chestnut limbs."</P>
<P>--That's well. Have them freshly shaven, bathed and perfumed from head to foot, ready for other games should they be asked. Go give my orders. Farewell."</P>
