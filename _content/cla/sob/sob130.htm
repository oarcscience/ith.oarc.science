<P>The first one gave me a necklace, a necklace of pearls worth a city, with temples and palaces, treasures and slaves.</P>
<P>The second wrote poetry for me. He said that my tresses were black as the night's, and my eyes were as blue as the day's.</P>
<P>The third one was handsome; so handsome, that his mother would blush when she kissed him. He put his hands on my knees, and his lips he would press to my feet.</P>
<P>You, you have said nothing to me. You have given me naught, being poor. And you are not overly handsome, but you are the one that I love.</P>
