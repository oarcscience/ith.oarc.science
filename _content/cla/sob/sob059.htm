<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">METAMORPHOSIS</H3>
<P>I formerly was amorous of the beauty of young men, and the memory of their words, one time, would keep me long awake.</P>
<P>I remember having carved a name in the bark of a sycamore. I remember having left a fragment of my gown upon the road where one was wont to pass.</P>
<P>I remember having loved. . . Oh! Pannychis, my child, in what hands have I left you? How could I, unhappy one, have thus abandoned you?</P>
<P>Today Mnasidika alone possesses me, and will forever have me. Let her receive as sacrifice the happiness of those whom I have left for her.</P>
