### TRICKERY

I awaken. Then he is gone! He left something! No: two empty amphora and
some sullied flowers. The rug is red with wine.

I slept, but I am still intoxicated. . . With whom did I come home? . .
. Anyhow, we went to bed together. The bed itself is even soaked in
sweat.

There might even have been several; the bed is so upset. I can't
remember. . . But someone must have seen them! There is my Phrygian. She
still is sleeping, cross-wise to the door.

I kick her in the breast and cry: "Bitch, you could not have. . . ." I
am so hoarse I cannot speak at all.
