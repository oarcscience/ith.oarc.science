### JEALOUS CARES

You must not dress your hair for fear the iron might burn your neck or
singe your lovely locks. You'll let it rest upon your shoulders, and
spread along your arms.

You must not dress yourself, for fear your girdle might redden the
fine-drawn lines about your hips. Remain naked like a little girl.

You must not even rise, for fear your tender feet might become sore with
walking here and there. You shall remain in bed, oh Eros' prey, and I
shall dress your wound!

For I would not see upon your body any other mark, Mnasidika, than the
mark of a kiss too long-impressed, the scratch of a sharpened nail, or
the purpled bar of my own embrace.
