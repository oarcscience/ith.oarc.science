### MYDZOURIS

Mydzouris, little baggage, cry no more. You are my friend. If the women
hurt you again, 'tis I who will answer them. Come to my arms and dry
your tears.

Yes, I know you are a dreadful child, and that your mother taught you
early to try out all the passions. But you are young, and that is why
you can do nothing that will not be charming.

The mouth of a girl of fifteen stays pure in spite of everything. The
lips of a hoary woman, although she be a virgin, are defiled; for the
only disgrace is to grow old, and we are not stigmatized except by
wrinkles.

Mydzouris, I like your frank eyes, your bold and shameless name, your
laughing voice, your light-built body. Come home with me and you will be
my aide, and when we go out together in the street, the women will say
"Hail" to you again.
