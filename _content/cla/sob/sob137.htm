<P>Stranger, stop, look who is signalling you: 'tis little Phanion of K&ocirc;s, she is well worth your choice.</P>
<P>See, her hair is curled like parsley, her skin is soft as the down of a woodland bird. She is small and brown. And she converses well.</P>
<P>If you should follow her, she would not ask you all your voyage-money; no, just a drachma or a pair of sandals.</P>
<P>You'll find she has a good bed in her house, fresh figs and milk and wine, and if it should be cold there'll be a fire.</P>
