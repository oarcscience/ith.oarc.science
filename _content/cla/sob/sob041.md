### THE COTTAGE

The little cottage where he has his bed is the loveliest on earth. It is
made of the boughs of trees, four walls of sun-baked clay, and ringleted
above with moss and sod.

I love him, for there we lie now that the nights are cool; and, the
cooler the nights, the longer they become. At break of day I find that I
am tired.

The mattress is upon the earth; two covers of black wool enclose our
warming bodies. His chest is pressing hard against my breasts. My heart
throbs. . .

He crushes me so hard that I shall break, frail little creature that I
know I am; but once he is in me nothing else exists, and I could have my
four limbs cut away without awakening from my ecstasy.
