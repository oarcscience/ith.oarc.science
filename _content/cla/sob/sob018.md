### THE SYMBOLIC RING

Travelers coming from Sardis speak of the necklaces and precious stones
with which the Lydian women deck themselves, from the tops of their
tresses to their tinted feet.

The young girls of my country have neither bracelets nor diadems, but
their fingers bear a silver ring, upon the scroll of which the triangle
of the goddess is engraved.

When they turn the apex outward, it signifies; "Psyche to be taken."
And, when they turn it inward: "Psyche taken."

The men believe in it, the women don't. As for myself, I scarcely notice
the direction of the apex, for Psyche is an easy catch. She is always to
be taken.
