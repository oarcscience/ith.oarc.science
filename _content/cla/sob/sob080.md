### EVENING BY THE FIRE

The winter is severe, Mnasidika. Everything is cold outside our bed.
Arise, however; come with me, for I have built a great fire of dead logs
and split kindling wood.

We will crouch down and warm ourselves, quite nude, our hair hung down
our backs, and drink milk out of the self-same cup and munch on honeyed
cakes.

How sonorous and gay the fire is! Are you not too near? Your skin is
getting red. Let me kiss it wherever the fire has made it hot.

I'll warm the iron amidst the burning brands and dress your hair right
here. And with a burnt-out coal I'll write your name upon the wall.
