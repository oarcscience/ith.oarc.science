### INCERTITUDE

I do not know if I shall mate myself with Glottis or with Kyse. As they
are not much alike, one cannot soothe me for the other's loss, and
greatly fear to make an evil choice.

Each has one of my hands, and one of my breasts too. To which I wonder
shall I give my mouth? to which my heart, and all one cannot share?

For it is shameful to stay this way, all three within one house. They
talk of such things here in Mytilene. Yesterday before the temple of
Ares a passing woman did not say "Good-day"

'Tis Glottis I prefer; but I cannot disown Kyse. What would become of
her all by herself? Or shall I leave them together as I found them, and
take another lover for myself?
