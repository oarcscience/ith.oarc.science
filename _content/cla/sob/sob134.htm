<P>"Yesterday," Na&iuml;s said to me, "I was in the square, when a little girl in scarlet rags and tatters walked up and offered roses to a cluster of young men. And this is what I heard:</P>
<P>'Buy something from me. --Explain yourself, little creature, for we don't know what you're selling: yourself? your roses? or both of them together? --If you buy all these flowers, I will give you mine for nothing.</P>
<P>--And how much do you want for all your roses? --My mother must have six oboli, or I'll be beaten like a bitch. --Follow us and you shall have a drachma. --Then should I go and get my little sister?'</P>
<P>And both of them followed these men. They had no breasts, Bilitis. They did not even know how to smile. They trotted off like kids led to the slaughter."</P>
