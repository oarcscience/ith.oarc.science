<P>I am beloved by little children; when they see me come they run to me and tug upon my tunic, and grasp my legs about with tiny arms.</P>
<P>If they have gathered flowers, all are mine; if they have caught a beetle, they place it in my hand; if they have nothing, they fondle me and make me sit before them.</P>
<P>Then they kiss me on the cheek, they rest their little heads upon my breasts; they supplicate me with their shining eyes. How well I know just what they mean to say!</P>
<P>They mean: "Bilitis sweet, tell us again, for we are good, the story of the hero Perseus, or else how little Helle met her death."&nbsp;<A HREF="sob154.htm#xref_39"><FONT SIZE="1">39</FONT></A></P>
