### SONG

Shades of the wood where she now ought to be, tell me, whence has my
fair mistress strayed? --She has gone down to the plain. --Meadow, oh!
tell me, where is my mistress? --She has followed the banks of the
stream.

--Beautiful river who just saw her passing, tell me, is she hereabouts?
--She has left me to stray on the road. --Oh, road, do you still see
her? --She has left me for the street.

--Oh, white street, path of the city, tell me, oh! where have you lead
her? --To the golden street, which enters Sardis. --Oh! pathway of
light, do her naked feet press you? --She has entered the home of the
King.

--Oh, palace of splendor, light of the world, give her again back to me!
--See! she has necklaces, hung to her breasts, chaplets of blossoms
entwined in her hair, long strings of pearls looped on her legs, and two
arms encircle her waist.
