### INTIMACIES

You ask why I am now a Lesbian, oh, Bilitis? But what flute-player is
not lesbian a little? I am poor; I have no bed; I sleep with her who
wishes me, and thank her with whatever charms I have.

We danced quite naked when we still were small; you know what dances,
oh, my dear!: the twelve desires of Aphrodite. We look at one another,
compare our nakedness, and find ourselves so pretty.

During the long night we become inflamed for the pleasure of the guests;
but our ardour is not feigned, and we feel it so much that sometimes one
of us entices her willing friend behind the doors.

How can we then love men, who are rude with us? They seize us like
whores, and leave before we can attain our pleasure. You who are a
woman, you know what I feel. You pleasure others as *you* would be
pleased.
