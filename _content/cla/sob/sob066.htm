<P>More than her baubles and her doll am I a plaything for Mnasidika. For hours on end, unspeaking, like a child, she amuses herself with all my body's charms.</P>
<P>She undoes my hair and does it up again according to her fancy, sometimes knotting it beneath my chin like some heavy cloth, or twisting it into a knot behind my neck, or plaiting it until its very end.</P>
<P>She looks with wonder at the color of my lashes, or on the bending of my elbow-joint. Sometimes she places me on hands and knees:</P>
<P>And then (it is one of her games), she slips her little head underneath, and plays the trembling kid at nursing time beneath its mother's belly.</P>
