### ROSES IN THE NIGHT

After night creeps up the sky, the earth belongs to us and to the gods.
We come from the fields to the brink of the stream; our bare feet guide
us from the heavy-shadowed woods into the clearings.

Tiny stars shine brilliantly enough for the tiny shadows that we are.
Sometimes we find a sleeping roe beneath the low-hung branches.

But that which is more beautiful at night than any other thing, is a
place known only to ourselves which draws us through the fastness of the
wood; a heavy bush of mysterious roses.

For no other touch of god-head upon earth can equal the scent of roses
in the night. How is it that when I found myself alone I was not
intoxicated by their smell?
