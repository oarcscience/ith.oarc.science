<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE STREAM IN THE WOOD</H3>
<P>I bathed alone in the stream in the wood. I must have frightened the poor na&iuml;ads, for I could scarcely see them far away in the dark water.</P>
<P>I called to them. To mimic them I plaited iris blossoms, black as my hair, about my neck, twined with knots of yellow gilly-flowers.</P>
<P>With a long floating weed, I made myself a green girdle, and to see it I pressed my breasts and inclined my head a little.</P>
<P>And I called: "Na&iuml;ads! na&iuml;ads! play with me, be nice." But the na&iuml;ads are transparent, and perhaps I even caressed their lissom arms, unknowing!</P>
