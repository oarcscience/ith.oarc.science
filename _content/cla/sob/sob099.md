### THE MAENADS

Through the forests that overhang the sea, the Maenads madly rushed.
Maskale of the fiery breasts, howling, brandished the sycamore phallos,
smeared with red.

All leaped and ran and cried aloud beneath their robes and crowns of
twisted vine, crotals clacking in their hands, and thyrses splitting the
bursting skins of echoing dulcimers.

With sopping hair and agile limbs, breasts reddened and tossed about,
sweat of cheeks and foam of lips, oh, Dionysos! they offered in return
the love that you had poured in them.

And the sea-wind tossed Heliokomis' russet hair unto the sky, and
whipped it into a furious flame on her body's white-wax torch.
