### LYKAS

Come, we will stray in the fields, under the juniper bushes; we will eat
honey fresh from the hive and make grasshopper traps from the daffodil
stems.

Come, we'll see Lykas, who watches his father's flocks on the shadowy
slopes of the Tauros. Surely he'll give us some milk.

I can hear his flute even now. He plays so cleverly. Here are the dogs
and the lambs, and there he leans against a tree. Is he not even as fair
as Adonis?

Oh, Lykas, give us some milk. Here are some figs from our trees. We have
come to stay with you. Oh! bearded nannies, do not leap so high, lest
you soon excite the restless goats.
