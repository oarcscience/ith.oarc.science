<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">MATERNAL COUNSEL</H3>
<P>My mother bathes me in the dark, she dresses me in the sunlight and coifs me in the soft glow of the lamp; but if I go out in the moonlight she ties my girdle and makes a double knot.</P>
<P>She tells me: "Play with the virgins, dance with the little children; do not look out of the window; fly the conversation of young men and fear the widow's counsel.</P>
<P>"Some evening, someone, as has always been, will come to lead you over the threshold in the midst of a great cort&egrave;ge of sounding drums and amorous flutes.</P>
<P>"That evening, when you go out, Bilitis, you will leave me three gourds of gall: one for the morning, one for the afternoon, and the third, the bitterest, for the festival days."</P>
