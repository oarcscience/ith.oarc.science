<P>I left the bed as she had left it, unmade and rumpled, coverlets awry, so that her body's print might rest still warm beside my own.</P>
<P>Until the next day I did not go to bathe, I wore no clothes and did not dress my hair, for fear I might erase some sweet caress.</P>
<P>That morning I did not eat, nor yet at dusk, and put no rouge nor powder on my lips, so that her kiss might cling a little longer.</P>
<P>I left the shutters closed, and did not open the door, for fear the memory of the might before might vanish with the wind.</P>
