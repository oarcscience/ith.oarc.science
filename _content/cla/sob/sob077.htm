<P>My little child, as few years older as I am than you, I love you, not as a lover loves, but as though you had come forth from my womb in labour.</P>
<P>When, stretched upon my knees, frail arms about my neck, you seek my breast, and with mouth held forward you slowly suck with palpitating lips,</P>
<P>I dream that at some former time I really nursed this supple, wet and tender mouth, this purple vase of myrrh in which my happiness is mysteriously enclosed.</P>
<P>Sleep! I'll cradle you upon my rocking knee with one hand. Sleep, so. I'll sing you mournful little songs, songs used to lull the new-born child to sleep. . .</P>
