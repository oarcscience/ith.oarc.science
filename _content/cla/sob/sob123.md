### TO ONE WHO HAS STRAYED

The love of women is more beautiful than all the loves we can
experience, and even you would think so, Kleon, if your soul were truly
amorous; but you only dream of vanities.

You waste your nights in cherishing these youths, who have no true
perception of our worth. Just look at them! How ugly they all are!
Compare their round heads to our heavy hair; seek our white breasts upon
their hardened chests.

Beside their narrow flanks, take note of our luxuriant haunches, an
ample couch, especially hollowed for the lover's use. Say finally what
other human lips, if not the ones that they would like to have, can so
exalt the pleasures?

You are ill, oh Kleon! but a girl can make you well. Go seek out young
Satyra, the daughter of my neighbor Gorgo. Her croup is a rose in the
sunlight, and she'll not refuse you the pleasure that she herself
prefers.
