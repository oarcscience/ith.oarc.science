<P>Four slaves watch my house: two robust Thracians at the door, a Sicilian in the kitchen, and a docile Phrygian mute at my bed.</P>
<P>The two Thracians are handsome men. They have sticks in their hands with which to chase poor lovers, and a hammer to nail upon the wall the garlands which are sent to me.</P>
<P>The Sicilian is a rare cook; I paid twelve minae for him. No other cook knows how to prepare fried croquettes and poppy-cakes as he does.</P>
<P>The Phrygian bathes me, coifs me, plucks my hair. She sleeps in my room each morning, and three nights of each month she takes my place beside my lovers.</P>
