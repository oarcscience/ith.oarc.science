### FUNERAL CHANT

Sing a funeral song, Mytilenian muses, sing! The earth is dark like a
mourning cloak, and the yellow trees are trembling like tresses that are
shorn.

Heraïos! oh, sad and gentle month! the leaves fall gently as the falling
snow, the sun-beams are much stronger in the naked forest dells. . . I
hear no longer anything but silence.

Here Pittakos, borne down with years, was carried to his tomb. Many whom
I used to know are dead. And she who lives is as though she were no
more, to me.

This is the tenth autumn I have watched dying on this land. It is time
for me also to die. Weep with me, Mytilenian muses, weep upon my
footprints in the earth!
