<P>Child, keep watch upon the door, and do not let any passers-by come in, for I and six young girls with lovely arms are going secretly to bathe in the basin's tepid pool.</P>
<P>We only want to laugh and swim a while. Let lovers stay outside. We'll drench our legs in the water, and, seated on the marble edge, play dice.</P>
<P>We'll play ball too. But let no lovers enter; our hair is too wet, our throats have gooseflesh and the ends of our fingers are wrinkled.</P>
<P>Besides, whoever found us naked would regret it! Bilitis is not Athene, but she only shows herself at her own hours and she punishes eyes that are too ardent.</P>
