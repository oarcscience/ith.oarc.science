<P>Panting, I took her hand and pressed it tightly beneath the humid skin of my left breast. My head tossed here and there and I moved my lips, but not a word escaped.</P>
<P>My maddened heart, sudden and hard, beat and beat upon my breast, as a captive satyr would beat about, tied in a goat-skin vessel. She said to me: "Your heart is troubling you. . ."</P>
<P>"Oh, Mnasidika!" I answered her, "a woman's heart is not seated <I>there</I>. This is but a little bird, a dove which stirs its feeble wings. The heart of a woman is more terrible.</P>
<P>"It burns like a myrtle-berry, with a bright red flame and beneath abundant foam. 'Tis there that I feel bitten by voracious Aphrodite."</P>
