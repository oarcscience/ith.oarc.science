### THE INN

Inn-keeper, we are four. Give us a room with two beds. It is too late
now to return to the city, and the rain has split the roads.

Bring us a basket of figs, some cheese and black wine; but first take
off my sandals and wash my feet, for the mud is tickling me.

You'll have two basins of water brought to the room, a full lamp, a
krater [135](sob154.htm#xref_135) and a kylix. You'll shake the covers
and beat up all the pillows.

But the beds must be of good solid maple, and the planks silent!
Tomorrow you will not awaken us.
