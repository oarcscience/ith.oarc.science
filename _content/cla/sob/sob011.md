### AWAKENING

It is already daylight. I should have long arisen. But morning sleep is
sweet, and the warmth of the bed keeps me snuggled up. I want to stay
still longer.

Soon I'll go to the stable. I'll give grass and flowers to the goats,
and a skin of fresh water, drawn from the well; and I shall drink out of
it just as they.

Then I'll tie them to the post and draw the milk from their warm udders;
and, if the kids are not jealous, we all shall suck the soft teats
together.

Did not Amalthea [29](sob154.htm#xref_29) give suck to Zeus? Then I
shall go. But not yet. The sun arose too soon, and mother has not yet
awakened.
