<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">GIANTS, SPHINX, PEGASUS, AND CHIMAERA, CENTAURS, GRIFFIN,</H3>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">AND PYGMIES.</H4>

<P>MONSTERS, in the language of mythology, were beings of unnatural
proportions or parts, usually regarded with terror, as possessing
immense strength and ferocity, which they employed for the injury
and annoyance of men. Some of them were supposed to combine the
members of different animals; such were the Sphinx and Chimaera and to
these all the terrible qualities of wild beasts were attributed,
together with human sagacity and faculties. Others, as the giants,
differed from men chiefly in their size; and in this particular we
must recognize a wide distinction among them. The human giants, if
so they may be called, such as the Cyclops, Antaeus, Orion, and
others, must be supposed not to be altogether disproportioned to human
beings, for they mingled in love and strife with them. But the
super-human giants, who warred with the gods, were of vastly larger
dimensions. Tityus, we are told, when stretched on the plain,
covered nine acres, and Enceladus required the whole of Mount AEtna to
be laid upon him to keep him down.
</P>
<P>We have already spoken of the war which the giants waged against the
gods, and of its result. While this war lasted the giants proved a
formidable enemy. Some of them, like Briareus, had a hundred arms;
others, like Typhon, breathed out fire. At one time they put the
gods to such fear that they fled into Egypt and hid themselves under
various forms. Jupiter took the form of a ram, whence he was
afterwards worshipped in Egypt as the god Ammon, with curved horns.
Apollo became a crow, Bacchus a goat, Diana a cat, Juno a cow, Venus a
fish, Mercury a bird. At another time the giants attempted to climb up
into heaven, and for that purpose took up the mountain Ossa and
piled it on Pelion.* They were at last subdued by thunderbolts,
which Minerva invented, and taught Vulcan and his Cyclops to make
for Jupiter.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE SPHINX.</H3>

</P>
<P>Laius, king of Thebes, was warned by an oracle that there was danger
to his throne and life if his new-born son should be suffered to
grow up. He therefore committed the child to the care of a herdsman
with orders to destroy him; but the herdsman, moved with pity, yet not
daring entirely to disobey, tied up the child by the feet and left him
hanging to the branch of a tree. In this condition the infant was
found by a peasant, who carried him to his master and mistress, by
whom he was adopted and called OEdipus, or Swollen-foot.
</P>
<P>Many years afterwards Laius being on his way to Delphi,
accompanied only by one attendant, met in a narrow road a young man
also driving in a chariot. On his refusal to leave the way at their
command the attendant killed one of his horses, and the stranger,
filled with rage, slew both Laius and his attendant. The young man was
OEdipus who thus unknowingly became the slayer of his own father.
</P>
<P>Shortly after this event the city of Thebes was afflicted with a
monster which infested the highroad. It was called the Sphinx. It
had the body of a lion and the upper part of a woman. It lay
crouched on the top of a rock, and arrested all travellers who came
that way, proposing to them a riddle, with the condition that those
who could solve it should pass safe, but those who failed should be
killed. Not one had yet succeeded in solving it, and all had been
slain. OEdipus was not daunted by these alarming accounts, but
boldly advanced to the trial. The Sphinx asked him, "What animal is
that which in the morning goes on feet, at noon on two, and in the
evening upon three?" Oedipus replied, "Man, who in childhood creeps on
hands and knees, in manhood walks erect, and in old age with the aid
of a staff." The Sphinx was so mortified at the solving of her
riddle that she cast herself down from the rock and perished.
</P>
<P>The gratitude of the people for their deliverance was so great
that they made OEdipus their king, giving him in marriage their
queen Jocasta. OEdipus, ignorant of his parentage, had already
become the slayer of his father; in marrying the queen he became the
husband of his mother. These horrors remained undiscovered, till at
length Thebes was afflicted with famine and pestilence, and the oracle
being consulted, the double crime of Oedipus came to light. Jocasta
put an end to her own life, and Oedipus, seized with madness, tore out
his eyes and wandered away from Thebes, dreaded and abandoned by all
except his daughters, who faithfully adhered to him, till after a
tedious period of miserable wandering he found the termination of
his wretched life.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">PEGASUS AND THE CHIMAERA.</H3>

</P>
<P>When Perseus cut off Medusa's head, the blood sinking into the earth
produced the winged horse Pegasus. Minerva caught and tamed him and
presented him to the Muses. The fountain Hippocrene, on the Muse's
mountain Helicon, was opened by a kick from his hoof.
</P>
<P>The Chimaera was a fearful monster, breathing fire. The fore part of
its body was a compound of the lion and the goat, and the hind part
a dragon's. It made great havoc in Lycia, so that the king, Iobates,
sought for some hero to destroy it. At that time there arrived at
his court a gallant young warrior, whose name was Bellerophon. He
brought letters from Proetus, the son-in-law of Iobates,
recommending Bellerophon in the warmest terms as an unconquerable
hero, but added at the close a request to his father-in-law to put him
to death. The reason was that Proetus was jealous of him, suspecting
that his wife Antea looked with too much admiration on the young
warrior. From this instance of Bellerophon being unconsciously the
bearer of his own death warrant, the expression "Bellerophontic
letters" arose, to describe any species of communication which a
person is made the bearer of, containing matter prejudicial to
himself.
</P>
<P>Iobates, on perusing the letters, was puzzled what to do, not
willing to violate the claims of hospitality, yet wishing to oblige
his son-in-law. A lucky thought occurred to him, to send Bellerophon
to combat with the Chimaera. Bellerophon accepted the proposal, but
before proceeding to the combat consulted the soothsayer Polyidus, who
advised him to procure if possible the horse Pegasus for the conflict.
For this purpose he directed him to pass the night in the temple of
Minerva. He did so, and as he slept Minerva came to him and gave him a
golden bridle. When he awoke the bridle remained in his hand.
Minerva also showed him Pegasus drinking at the well of Pirene, and at
sight of the bridle the winged steed came willingly and suffered
himself to be taken. Bellerophon mounted him, rose with him into the
air, soon found the Chimaera, and gained an easy victory over the
monster.
</P>
<P>After the conquest of the Chimaera Bellerophon was exposed to
further trials and labours by his unfriendly host, but by the aid of
Pegasus he triumphed in them all, till at length Iobates, seeing
that the hero was a special favourite of the gods, gave him his
daughter in marriage and made him his successor on the throne. At last
Bellerophon by his pride and presumption drew upon himself the anger
of the gods; it is said he even attempted to fly up into heaven on his
winged steed, but Jupiter sent a gadfly which stung Pegasus and made
him throw his rider, who became lame and blind in consequence. After
this Bellerophon wandered lonely through the Aleian field, avoiding
the paths of men, and died miserably.

</P>
<P>Milton alludes to Bellerophon in the beginning of the seventh book
of "Paradise Lost":

</P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Descend from Heaven, Urania, by that name<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If rightly thou art called, whose voice divine<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following, above the Olympian hill I soar,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the flight of Pegasean wing.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upled by thee,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An earthly guest, and drawn empyreal air<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Thy tempering); with like safety guided down<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return me to my native element;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest, from this flying steed unreined (as once<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bellerophon, though from a lower clime),<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dismounted, on the Aleian field I fall,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erroneous there to wander and forlorn."<BR>

<P>Young, in his "Night Thoughts," speaking of the sceptic, says:

</P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He whose blind thought futurity denies,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconscious bears, Bellerophon, like thee<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His own indictment; he condemns himself.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who reads his bosom reads immortal life,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or nature there, imposing on her sons,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has written fables; man was made a lie."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vol. II., p. 12.<BR>

<P>Pegasus, being the horse of the Muses, has always been at the
service of the poets. Schiller tells a pretty story of his having been
sold by a needy poet and put to the cart and the plough. He was not
fit for such service, and his clownish master could make nothing of
him. But a youth stepped forth and asked leave to try him. As soon
as he was seated on his back the horse, which had appeared at first
vicious, and afterwards spirit-broken, rose kingly, a spirit, a god,
unfolded the splendour of his wings, and soared towards heaven. Our
own poet Longfellow also records adventure of this famous steed in his
"Pegasus in Pound."

</P>
<P>Shakespeare alludes to Pegasus in "Henry IV.," where Vernon
describes Prince Henry:

</P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His cuishes on this thighs, gallantly armed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And vaulted with such ease into his seat,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if an angel dropped down from the clouds,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And witch the world with noble horsemanship."<BR>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE CENTAURS.</H3>

<P>These monsters were represented as men from the head to the loins,
while the remainder of the body was that of a horse. The ancients were
too fond of a horse to consider the union of his nature with man's
as forming a very degraded compound, and accordingly the Centaur is
the only one of the fancied monsters of antiquity to which any good
traits are assigned. The Centaurs were admitted to the companionship
of man, and at the marriage of Pirithous with Hippodamia they were
among the guests. At the feast Eurytion, one of the Centaurs, becoming
intoxicated with the wine, attempted to offer violence to the bride;
the other Centaurs followed his example, and a dreadful conflict arose
in which several of them were slain. This is the celebrated battle
of the Lapithae and Centaurs, a favourite subject with the sculptors
and poets of antiquity.
</P>
<P>But not all the Centaurs were like the rude guests of Pirithous.
Chiron was instructed by Apollo and Diana, and was renowned for his
skill in hunting, medicine, music, and the art of prophecy. The most
distinguished heroes of Grecian story were his pupils. Among the
rest the infant AEsculapius was intrusted to his charge by Apollo, his
father. When the sage returned to his home bearing the infant, his
daughter Ocyrhoe came forth to meet him, and at sight of the child
burst forth into a prophetic strain (for she was a prophetess),
foretelling the glory that he was to achieve. AEsculapius when grown
up became a renowned physician, and even in one instance succeeded
in restoring the dead to life. Pluto resented this, and Jupiter, at
his request, struck the bold physician with lightning, and killed him,
but after his death received him into the number of the gods.
</P>
<P>Chiron was the wisest and justest of all the Centaurs, and at his
death Jupiter placed him among the stars as the constellation
Sagittarius.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE PYGMIES</H3>

</P>
<P>The Pygmies were a nation of dwarfs, so called from a Greek word
which means the cubit or measure of about thirteen inches, which was
said to be the height of these people. They lived near the sources
of the Nile, or according to others, in India. Homer tells us that the
cranes used to migrate every winter to the Pygmies' country, and their
appearance was the signal of bloody warfare to the puny inhabitants,
who had to take up arms to defend their cornfields against the
rapacious strangers. The Pygmies and their enemies the Cranes form the
subject of several works of art.
</P>
<P>Later writers tell of an army of Pygmies which finding Hercules
asleep, made preparations to attack him, as if they were about to
attack a city. But the hero, awaking, laughed at the little
warriors, wrapped some of them up in his lion's skin, and carried them
to Eurystheus.

</P>
<P>Milton uses the Pygmies for a simile, "Paradise Lost," Book I.:

</P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...like that Pygmaean race<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the Indian mount, of fairy elves<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose midnight revels by a forest side,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or fountain, some belated peasant sees<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Or dreams he sees), while overhead the moon<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sits arbitress, and nearer to the earth<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheels her pale course; they on their mirth and dance<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intent, with jocund music charm his ear.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds."<BR>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE GRIFFIN, OR GRYPHON.</H3>

<P>The Griffin is a monster with the body of a lion, the head and wings
of an eagle, and back covered with feathers. Like birds it builds
its nest, and instead of an egg lays an agate therein. It has long
claws and talons of such a size that the people of that country make
them into drinking-cups. India was assigned as the native country of
the Griffins. They found gold in the mountains and built their nests
of it, for which reason their nests were very tempting to the hunters,
and they were forced to keep vigilant guard over them. Their
instinct led them to know where buried treasures lay, and they did
their best to keep plunderers at a distance. The Arimaspians, among
whom the Griffins flourished, were a one-eyed people of Scythia.
</P>
<P>Milton borrows a simile from the Griffins, "Paradise Lose," Book
II.:

</P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As when a Gryphon through the wilderness<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With winged course, o'er hill and moory dale,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stealth<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had from his wakeful custody purloined<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guarded gold," etc.<BR>
