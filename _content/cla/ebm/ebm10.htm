<p><small>Greatest of the gods, God with many names, God ever-ruling, and ruling all things! <br> Zeus, origin of Nature, governing the universe by law, <br> All hail! For it is right for mortals to address thee; <br> For we are thy offspring, and we alone of all<br> That live and creep on earth have the power of imitative speech. <br> Therefore will I praise thee, and hymn forever thy power. <br> Thee the wide heaven, which surrounds the earth, obeys: <br> Following where thou wilt, willingly obeying thy law. <br> Thou holdest at thy service, in thy mighty hands, <br> The two-edged, flaming, immortal thunderbolt, <br> Before whose flash all nature trembles. <br> Thou rulest in the common reason, which goes through all, <br> And appears mingled in all things, great or small, <br> Which filling all nature, is king of all existences. <br> Nor without thee, Oh Deity,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_135"></A><A HREF="#fn_135"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> does anything happen in the world, <br> From the divine ethereal pole to the great ocean, <br> Except only the evil preferred by the senseless wicked. <br> But thou also art able to bring to order that which is chaotic, <br> Giving form to what is formless, and making the discordant friendly; <br> So reducing all variety to unity, and even making good out of evil. <br> Thus throughout nature is one great law <br> Which only the wicked seek to disobey, <br> Poor fools! who long for happiness, <br> But will not see nor hear the divine commands.</small></p>

<p><small>[In frenzy blind they stray away from good,<br> By thirst of glory tempted, or sordid avarice,<br> Or pleasures sensual and joys that fall.]<br> But do thou, Oh Zeus, all-bestower, cloud-compeller!<br> Ruler of thunder! guard men from sad error.<br> Father! dispel the clouds of the soul, and let us follow<br> The laws of thy great and just reign!<br> That we may be honored, let us honor thee again,<br> Chanting thy great deeds, as is proper for mortals,<br> For nothing can be better for gods or men<br> Than to adore with hymns the Universal King.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_136"></A><A HREF="#fn_136"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></small></p>
