Fortune and the Three Fates.

LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS.

##### DRAWN FROM THE ANTIQUE BY A. L. RAWSON.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span class="smallcaps">A description</span> of the illustrations to
this volume properly includes the two or three theories of human life
held by the ancient Greeks, and the beautiful myth of Demeter and
Proserpina, the most charming of all mythological fancies, and the
Orgies of Bacchus, which together supplied the motives to the artists of
the originals from which these drawings were made.

From them we learn that it was believed that the soul is a part of, or a
spark from, the Great Soul of the Kosmos, the Central Sun of the
intellectual universe, and therefore immortal; has lived before, and
will continue to live after this “body prison” is dissolved; that the
river Styx is between us and the unseen world, and hence we have no
recollection of any former state of existence; and that the body is
Hades, in which the soul is made to suffer for past misdeeds done in the
unseen world.

Poets and philosophers, tragedians and comedians, embellished the myth
with a thousand fine fancies which were

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

woven into the ritual of Eleusis, or were presented in the theaters
during the Bacchic festivals.

The pictures include, beside the costumes of priests, priestesses, and
their attendants, and of the fauns and satyrs, many of the sacred
vessels and implements used in celebrating the Mysteries, in the orgies,
and in the theaters, all of which were drawn by the ancient artists from
the objects represented, and their work has been carefully followed
here.

She would have been torn in pieces by the hunter’s dogs, but Jupiter interposed and translated her to the heavens, where she forms the constellation The Great Bear. Juno was jealous of Jupiter, and requested Thetis to refuse the Great Bear permission to descend at night beneath the waves of ocean, and she, being also jealous of Poseidon, complied, and therefore the dipper does not dip, but revolves close around the pole star.</span></p></td>

been classed among the artificial attractions of the theater where it
belongs, and where it did a large share of duty in the Mysteries. They
were invented by the poets as an impersonation of the life that animates
the branches of trees when the wind sweeps through them, meaning,
whistling, or shrieking in the gale. They were said to be the chief
attendants on Bacchus, and to delight in revel and wine.</span>

ancients adored this power under the emblems of the organs of
generation. Many passages in the Bible denounce that worship, which is
called “the grove,” and usually was an upright stone, or wooden pillar,
plain or ornamented, as in Rome, where it became a statue to the waist,
as seen in the engraving. The Palladium at Athens was a Greek form. The
Druzes of Mount Lebanon in Syria now dispense with emblems of wood and
stone, and use the natural objects in their mystic rites and
ceremonies.</span>

The fair huntress sometimes is permitted, as when she is the new moon, or in the first quarter, to approach near the place where her beloved one lingers near the Hesperian gardens, and to follow him even to the Pillars of Hercules, but never to embrace him. The new moon, as soon as visible, sets near but not with the sun. Endymion reluctantly sinks behind the western horizon, and would linger until the loved one can be folded in his arms, but his duty calls and he must turn his steps toward the Elysian Fields to cheer the noble and good souls who await his presence, ever cheerful and benign. Diana follows closely after and is welcomed by the brave and beautiful inhabitants of the Peaceful Islands, but while receiving their homage her lover hastens on toward the eastern gates, where the golden fleece makes the morning sky resplendent.</span></p></td>

The loves bear aloft her magic girdle, which Juno borrowed as a means of winning back Jupiter’s affection. The rose and the myrtle were sacred to her. Her worship was the motive for building temples in Cythera and in Cyprus at Amathus, Idalium. Golgoi, and in many other places.

At a ford the hero entrusts his bride to Nessus the Centaur, to carry across the river. The ferryman made love to the lady, and Hercules resented the indiscretion, and wounded him by an arrow. Dying Nessus tells Deianeira to keep his blood as a love charm in case her husband should love another woman. Hercules did love another, named Iole, and Deianeira dipped his shirt in the blood of Nessus—the crimson and scarlet clouds of a splendid sunset are made glorious by the blood of Nessus, and Hercules is burnt on the funeral pyre of scarlet and crimson sunset clouds.</span></p></td>
