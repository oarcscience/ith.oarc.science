<P>3. Now it may be observed, first of all, that we cannot hold
utterly cheap either the indeterminate, or even a Kind whose 
very idea
implies absence of form, provided only that it offer itself to its
Priors and [through them] to the Highest Beings. We have the
parallel of the Soul itself in its relation to the
Intellectual-Principle and the Divine Reason, taking shape by these
and led so to a nobler principle of form.

<P>Further, a compound in the Intellectual order is not to be
confounded with a compound in the realm of Matter; the Divine
Reasons are compounds and their Act is to produce a compound, namely
that [lower] Nature which works towards Idea. And there is not only
a difference of function; there is a still more notable difference
of source. Then, too, the Matter of the realm of process ceaselessly
changes its form: in the eternal, Matter is immutably one and the
same, so that the two are diametrically opposites. The Matter of
this realm is all things in turn, a new entity in every 
separate case,
so that nothing is permanent and one thing ceaselessly pushes
another out of being: Matter has no identity here. In the 
Intellectual
it is all things at once: and therefore has nothing to 
change into: it
already and ever contains all. This means that not even in its own
Sphere is the Matter there at any moment shapeless: no doubt that is
true of the Matter here as well; but shape is held by a very 
different
right in the two orders of Matter.

<P>As to whether Matter is eternal or a thing of process, this will
be clear when we are sure of its precise nature.
