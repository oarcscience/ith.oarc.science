<P>16. We have, of course, already seen that a secondary must
follow upon the First, and that this is a power immeasurably 
fruitful;
and we indicated that this truth is confirmed by the entire order of
things since there is nothing, not even in the lowest ranks, void of
the power of generating. We have now to add that, since things
engendered tend downwards and not upwards and, especially, move
towards multiplicity, the first principle of all must be less a
manifold than any.

<P>That which engenders the world of sense cannot itself be a
sense-world; it must be the Intellect and the Intellectual world;
similarly, the prior which engenders the Intellectual-Principle and
the Intellectual world cannot be either, but must be 
something of less
multiplicity. The manifold does not rise from the manifold: the
intellectual multiplicity has its source in what is not manifold; by
the mere fact of being manifold, the thing is not the first 
principle:
we must look to something earlier.

<P>All must be grouped under a unity which, as standing outside of
all multiplicity and outside of any ordinary simplicity, is the
veritably and essentially simplex.

<P>Still, how can a Reason-Principle [the Intellectual],
characteristically a manifold, a total, derive from what is
obviously no Reason-Principle?

<P>But how, failing such origin in the simplex, could we 
escape [what
cannot be accepted] the derivation of a Reason-Principle from a
Reason-Principle?

<P>And how does the secondarily good [the imaged Good] derive from
The Good, the Absolute? What does it hold from the Absolute Good to
entitle it to the name?

<P>Similarity to the prior is not enough, it does not help towards
goodness; we demand similarity only to an actually existent Good:
the goodness must depend upon derivation from a Prior of 
such a nature
that the similarity is desirable because that Prior is good, just as
the similarity would be undesirable if the Prior were not good.

<P>Does the similarity with the Prior consist, then, in a voluntary
resting upon it?

<P>It is rather that, finding its condition satisfying, it seeks
nothing: the similarity depends upon the all-sufficiency of what it
possesses; its existence is agreeable because all is present to it,
and present in such a way as not to be even different from it
[Intellectual-Principle is Being].

<P>All life belongs to it, life brilliant and perfect; thus 
all in it
is at once life-principle and Intellectual-Principle, nothing in it
aloof from either life or intellect: it is therefore self-sufficing
and seeks nothing: and if it seeks nothing this is because it has in
itself what, lacking, it must seek. It has, therefore, its 
Good within
itself, either by being of that order- in what we have 
called its life
and intellect- or in some other quality or character going to
produce these.

<P>If this [secondary principle] were The Good [The Absolute],
nothing could transcend these things, life and intellect: but, given
the existence of something higher, this Intellectual-Principle must
possess a life directed towards that Transcendent, dependent upon
it, deriving its being from it, living towards it as towards its
source. The First, then, must transcend this principle of life and
intellect which directs thither both the life in itself, a 
copy of the
Reality of the First, and the intellect in itself which is again a
copy, though of what original there we cannot know.
