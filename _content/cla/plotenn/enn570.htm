<P>10. Another method of division is possible: substances may be
classed as hot-dry, dry-cold, cold-moist, or however we 
choose to make
the coupling. We may then proceed to the combination and blending of
these couples, either halting at that point and going no further
than the compound, or else subdividing by habitation- on the 
earth, in
the earth- or by form and by the differences exhibited by living
beings, not qua living, but in their bodies viewed as instruments of
life.

<P>Differentiation by form or shape is no more out of place than a
division based on qualities- heat, cold and the like. If it be
objected that qualities go to make bodies what they are, then, we
reply, so do blendings, colours, shapes. Since our discussion is
concerned with Sensible Substance, it is not strange that it should
turn upon distinctions related to sense-perception: this Substance
is not Being pure and simple, but the Sensible Being which 
we call the
Universe.

<P>We have remarked that its apparent subsistence is in fact an
assemblage of Sensibles, their existence guaranteed to us by
sense-perception. But since their combination is unlimited, our
division must be guided by the Form-Ideas of living beings, as for
example the Form-Idea of Man implanted in Body; the particular Form
acts as a qualification of Body, but there is nothing unreasonable
in using qualities as a basis of division.

<P>We may be told that we have distinguished between simple and
composite bodies, even ranking them as opposites. But our 
distinction,
we reply, was between material and organic bodies and raised no
question of the composite. In fact, there exists no means of
opposing the composite to the simple; it is necessary to 
determine the
simples in the first stage of division, and then, combining them on
the basis of a distinct underlying principle, to differentiate the
composites in virtue of their places and shapes, distinguishing for
example the heavenly from the earthly.

<P>These observations will suffice for the Being [Substance], or
rather the Becoming, which obtains in the Sensible realm.
