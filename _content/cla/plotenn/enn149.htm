<P>1. Some enquiry must be made into what is known as the complete
transfusion of material substances.

<P>Is it possible that fluid be blended with fluid in such 
a way that
each penetrate the other through and through? or- a difference of no
importance if any such penetration occurs- that one of them pass
completely through the other?

<P>Those that admit only contact need not detain us. They 
are dealing
with mixture, not with the coalescence which makes the total a thing
of like parts, each minutest particle being composed of all the
combined elements.

<P>But there are those who, admitting coalescence, confine it to
the qualities: to them the material substances of two bodies are in
contact merely, but in this contact of the matter they find footing
for the qualities of each.

<P>Their view is plausible because it rejects the notion of total
admixture and because it recognizes that the masses of the mixing
bodies must be whittled away if there is to be mixture without any
gap, if, that is to say, each substance must be divided within
itself through and through for complete interpenetration with the
other. Their theory is confirmed by the cases in which two mixed
substances occupy a greater space than either singly, especially a
space equal to the conjoined extent of each: for, as they point out,
in an absolute interpenetration the infusion of the one into 
the other
would leave the occupied space exactly what it was before and, where
the space occupied is not increased by the juxtaposition, 
they explain
that some expulsion of air has made room for the incoming substance.
They ask further, how a minor quantity of one substance can be
spread out so as to interpenetrate a major quantity of another. In
fact they have a multitude of arguments.

<P>Those, on the other hand, that accept "complete transfusion,"
might object that it does not require the reduction of the mixed
things to fragments, a certain cleavage being sufficient: thus, for
instance, sweat does not split up the body or even pierce 
holes in it.
And if it is answered that this may well be a special decree 
of Nature
to allow of the sweat exuding, there is the case of those 
manufactured
articles, slender but without puncture, in which we can see a liquid
wetting them through and through so that it runs down from the upper
to the under surface. How can this fact be explained, since both the
liquid and the solid are bodily substances? Interpenetration without
disintegration is difficult to conceive, and if there is such mutual
disintegration the two must obviously destroy each other.

<P>When they urge that often there is a mixing without augmentation
their adversaries can counter at once with the exit of air.

<P>When there is an increase in the space occupied, nothing refutes
the explanation- however unsatisfying- that this is a necessary
consequence of two bodies bringing to a common stock their magnitude
equally with their other attributes: size is as permanent as 
any other
property; and, exactly as from the blending of qualities 
there results
a new form of thing, the combination of the two, so we find a new
magnitude; the blending gives us a magnitude representing each of
the two. But at this point the others will answer, "If you mean that
substance lies side by side with substance and mass with mass, each
carrying its quantum of magnitude, you are at one with us: if there
were complete transfusion, one substance sinking its original
magnitude in the other, we would have no longer the case of two
lines joined end to end by their terminal points and thus 
producing an
increased extension; we would have line superimposed upon line with,
therefore, no increase."

<P>But a lesser quantity permeates the entire extent of a 
larger; the
smallest is sunk in the greatest; transfusion is exhibited
unmistakably. In certain cases it is possible to pretend 
that there is
no total penetration but there are manifest examples leaving no room
for the pretence. In what they say of the spreading out of 
masses they
cannot be thought very plausible; the extension would have to be
considerable indeed in the case of a very small quantity [to be in
true mixture with a very large mass]; for they do not 
suggest any such
extension by change as that of water into air.
