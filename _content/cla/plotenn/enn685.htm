<P>4. It will be asked how act rising from desire can be voluntary,
since desire pulls outward and implies need; to desire is still to
be drawn, even though towards the good.

<P>Intellectual-Principle itself comes under the doubt; having a
certain nature and acting by that nature can it be said to have
freedom and self-disposal- in an act which it cannot leave
unenacted? It may be asked, also, whether freedom may strictly be
affirmed of such beings as are not engaged in action.

<P>However that may be, where there is such act there is compulsion
from without, since, failing motive, act will not be performed.
These higher beings, too, obey their own nature; where then is their
freedom?

<P>But, on the other hand, can there be talk of constraint where
there is no compulsion to obey an extern; and how can any movement
towards a good be counted compulsion? Effort is free once it is
towards a fully recognised good; the involuntary is, 
precisely, motion
away from a good and towards the enforced, towards something not
recognised as a good; servitude lies in being powerless to move
towards one's good, being debarred from the preferred path 
in a menial
obedience. Hence the shame of slavedom is incurred not when one is
held from the hurtful but when the personal good must be yielded in
favour of another's.

<P>Further, this objected obedience to the characteristic nature
would imply a duality, master and mastered; but an undivided
Principle, a simplex Activity, where there can be no difference of
potentiality and act, must be free; there can be no thought 
of "action
according to the nature," in the sense of any distinction between
the being and its efficiency, there where being and act are 
identical.
Where act is performed neither because of another nor at another's
will, there surely is freedom. Freedom may of course be an
inappropriate term: there is something greater here: it is
self-disposal in the sense, only, that there is no disposal by the
extern, no outside master over the act.

<P>In a principle, act and essence must be free. No doubt
Intellectual-Principle itself is to be referred to a yet higher; but
this higher is not extern to it; Intellectual-Principle is within
the Good; possessing its own good in virtue of that indwelling, much
more will it possess freedom and self-disposal which are sought only
for the sake of the good. Acting towards the good, it must all the
more possess self-disposal for by that Act it is directed towards
the Principle from which it proceeds, and this its act is 
self-centred
and must entail its very greatest good.
