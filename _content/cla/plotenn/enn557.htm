<P>20. We may thus distinguish two phases of Intellect, in one of
which it may be taken as having no contact whatever with particulars
and no Act upon anything; thus it is kept apart from being a
particular intellect. In the same way science is prior to any of its
constituent species, and the specific science is prior to any of its
component parts: being none of its particulars, it is the 
potentiality
of all; each particular, on the other hand, is actually itself, but
potentially the sum of all the particulars: and as with the specific
science, so with science as a whole. The specific sciences lie in
potentiality in science the total; even in their specific character
they are potentially the whole; they have the whole 
predicated of them
and not merely a part of the whole. At the same time, science must
exist as a thing in itself, unharmed by its divisions.

<P>So with Intellect. Intellect as a whole must be thought of as
prior to the intellects actualized as individuals; but when 
we come to
the particular intellects, we find that what subsists in the
particulars must be maintained from the totality. The Intellect
subsisting in the totality is a provider for the particular
intellects, is the potentiality of them: it involves them as members
of its universality, while they in turn involve the universal
Intellect in their particularity, just as the particular science
involves science the total.

<P>The great Intellect, we maintain, exists in itself and the
particular intellects in themselves; yet the particulars are
embraced in the whole, and the whole in the particulars. The
particular intellects exist by themselves and in another, the
universal by itself and in those. All the particulars exist
potentially in that self-existent universal, which actually is the
totality, potentially each isolated member: on the other hand, each
particular is actually what it is [its individual self], potentially
the totality. In so far as what is predicated of them is their
essence, they are actually what is predicated of them; but where the
predicate is a genus, they are that only potentially. On the other
hand, the universal in so far as it is a genus is the potentiality
of all its subordinate species, though none of them in actuality;
all are latent in it, but because its essential nature exists in
actuality before the existence of the species, it does not submit to
be itself particularized. If then the particulars are to exist in
actuality- to exist, for example, as species- the cause must lie in
the Act radiating from the universal.
