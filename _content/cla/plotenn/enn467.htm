<P>1. There is a principle having intellection of the external and
another having self-intellection and thus further removed from
duality.

<P>Even the first mentioned is not without an effort 
towards the pure
unity of which it is not so capable: it does actually contain its
object, though as something other than itself.

<P>In the self-intellective, there is not even this distinction of
being: self-conversing, the subject is its own object, and thus
takes the double form while remaining essentially a unity. The
intellection is the more profound for this internal possession of
the object.

<P>This principle is the primally intellective since there can be
no intellection without duality in unity. If there is no unity,
perceiving principle and perceived object will be different, and the
intellection, therefore, not primal: a principle concerned with
something external cannot be the primally intellective since it does
not possess the object as integrally its own or as itself; if it
does possess the object as itself- the condition of true 
intellection-
the two are one. Thus [in order to primal intellection] there must
be a unity in duality, while a pure unity with no counterbalancing
duality can have no object for its intellection and ceases to be
intellective: in other words the primally intellective must 
be at once
simplex and something else.

<P>But the surest way of realizing that its nature demands this
combination of unity and duality is to proceed upwards from the
Soul, where the distinction can be made more dearly since the
duality is exhibited more obviously.

<P>We can imagine the Soul as a double light, a lesser
corresponding to the soul proper, a purer representing its
intellective phase; if now we suppose this intellective 
light equal to
the light which is to be its object, we no longer distinguish
between them; the two are recognised as one: we know, indeed, that
there are two, but as we see them they have become one: this gives
us the relation between the intellective subject and the object of
intellection [in the duality and unity required by that primal
intellection]: in our thought we have made the two into one; but on
the other hand the one thing has become two, making itself into a
duality at the moment of intellection, or, to be more exact, being
dual by the fact of intellection and single by the fact that its
intellectual object is itself.
