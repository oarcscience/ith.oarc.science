#### Section 4

4\. But there are earlier and loftier beauties than these. In the
sense-bound life we are no longer granted to know them, but the soul,
taking no help from the organs, sees and proclaims them. To the vision
of these we must mount, leaving sense to its own low place.

As it is not for those to speak of the graceful forms of the material
world who have never seen them or known their grace- men born blind, let
us suppose- in the same way those must be silent upon the beauty of
noble conduct and of learning and all that order who have never cared
for such things, nor may those tell of the splendour of virtue who have
never known the face of Justice and of Moral-Wisdom beautiful beyond the
beauty of Evening and of dawn.

Such vision is for those only who see with the Soul's sight- and at the
vision, they will rejoice, and awe will fall upon them and a trouble
deeper than all the rest could ever stir, for now they are moving in the
realm of Truth.

This is the spirit that Beauty must ever induce, wonderment and a
delicious trouble, longing and love and a trembling that is all delight.
For the unseen all this may be felt as for the seen; and this the Souls
feel for it, every soul in some degree, but those the more deeply that
are the more truly apt to this higher love- just as all take delight in
the beauty of the body but all are not stung as sharply, and those only
that feel the keener wound are known as Lovers.
