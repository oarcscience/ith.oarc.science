<P>6. But, if all this be true, how can evil fall within 
the scope of
seership? The predictions of the seers are based on 
observation of the
Universal Circuit: how can this indicate the evil with the good?

<P>Clearly the reason is that all contraries coalesce. Take, for
example, Shape and Matter: the living being [of the lower order] is
a coalescence of these two; so that to be aware of the Shape and the
Reason-Principle is to be aware of the Matter on which the Shape has
been imposed.

<P>The living-being of the compound order is not present 
[as pure and
simple Idea] like the living being of the Intellectual order: in the
compound entity, we are aware, at once, of the 
Reason-Principle and of
the inferior element brought under form. Now the Universe is such a
compound living thing: to observe, therefore, its content is to be
aware not less of its lower elements than of the Providence which
operates within it.

<P>This Providence reaches to all that comes into being; its scope
therefore includes living things with their actions and states, the
total of their history at once overruled by the Reason-Principle and
yet subject in some degree to Necessity.

<P>These, then, are presented as mingled both by their 
initial nature
and by the continuous process of their existence; and the Seer is
not able to make a perfect discrimination setting on the one side
Providence with all that happens under Providence and on the other
side what the substrate communicates to its product. Such
discrimination is not for a man, not for a wise man or a divine man:
one may say it is the prerogative of a god. Not causes but facts lie
in the Seer's province; his art is the reading of the scriptures of
Nature which tell of the ordered and never condescend to the
disorderly; the movement of the Universe utters its testimony to him
and, before men and things reveal themselves, brings to light what
severally and collectively they are.

<P>Here conspires with There and There with Here, elaborating
together the consistency and eternity of a Kosmos and by their
correspondences revealing the sequence of things to the trained
observer- for every form of divination turns upon correspondences.
Universal interdependence, there could not be, but universal
resemblance there must. This probably is the meaning of the saying
that Correspondences maintain the Universe.

<P>This is a correspondence of inferior with inferior, of superior
with superior, eye with eye, foot with foot, everything with its
fellow and, in another order, virtue with right action and vice with
unrighteousness. Admit such correspondence in the All and we have
the possibility of prediction. If the one order acts on the 
other, the
relation is not that of maker to thing made- the two are 
coeval- it is
the interplay of members of one living being; each in its own place
and way moves as its own nature demands; to every organ its grade
and task, and to every grade and task its effective organ.
