<P>6. But in fact everything follows its own Kind; the birth is a
horse because it comes from the Horse Kind, a man by springing from
the Human Kind; offspring answers to species. Allow the 
kosmic circuit
its part, a very powerful influence upon the thing brought 
into being:
allow the stars a wide material action upon the bodily part of the
man, producing heat and cold and their natural resultants in the
physical constitution; still does such action explain character,
vocation and especially all that seems quite independent of material
elements, a man taking to letters, to geometry, to gambling, and
becoming an originator in any of these pursuits? And can we imagine
the stars, divine beings, bestowing wickedness? And what of 
a doctrine
that makes them wreak vengeance, as for a wrong, because they are in
their decline or are being carried to a position beneath the 
earth- as
if a decline from our point of view brought any change to
themselves, as if they ever ceased to traverse the heavenly spheres
and to make the same figure around the earth.

<P>Nor may we think that these divine beings lose or gain 
in goodness
as they see this one or another of the company in various 
aspects, and
that in their happier position they are benignant to us and, less
pleasantly situated, turn maleficent. We can but believe that their
circuit is for the protection of the entirety of things while they
furnish the incidental service of being letters on which the augur,
acquainted with that alphabet, may look and read the future 
from their
pattern- arriving at the thing signified by such analogies as that a
soaring bird tells of some lofty event.
