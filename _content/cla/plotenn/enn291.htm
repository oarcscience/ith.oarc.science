<P>5. But what place is left for the particular souls, 
yours and mine
and another's?

<P>May we suppose the Soul to be appropriated on the lower ranges
to some individual, but to belong on the higher to that other sphere?

<P>At this there would be a Socrates as long as Socrates' soul
remained in body; but Socrates ceases to exist, precisely on
attainment of the highest.

<P>Now nothing of Real Being is ever annulled.

<P>In the Supreme, the Intellectual-Principles are not annulled,
for in their differentiation there is no bodily partition, no
passing of each separate phase into a distinct unity; every 
such phase
remains in full possession of that identical being. It is exactly so
with the souls.

<P>By their succession they are linked to the several
Intellectual-Principles, for they are the expression, the Logos, of
the Intellectual-Principles, of which they are the unfolding;
brevity has opened out to multiplicity; by that point of their being
which least belongs to the partial order, they are attached each to
its own Intellectual original: they have already chosen the way of
division; but to the extreme they cannot go; thus they keep, at
once, identification and difference; each soul is permanently a
unity [a self] and yet all are, in their total, one being.

<P>Thus the gist of the matter is established: one soul the 
source of
all; those others, as a many founded in that one, are, on the
analogy of the Intellectual-Principle, at once divided and
undivided; that Soul which abides in the Supreme is the one 
expression
or Logos of the Intellectual-Principle, and from it spring other
Reason-Principles, partial but immaterial, exactly as in the
differentiation of the Supreme.
