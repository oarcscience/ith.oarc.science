<P>7. What, then, are the several entities observable in this
plurality?

<P>We have found Substance [Essence] and life simultaneously
present in Soul. Now, this Substance is a common property of 
Soul, but
life, common to all souls, differs in that it is a property of
Intellect also.

<P>Having thus introduced Intellect and its life we make a single
genus of what is common to all life, namely, Motion. 
Substance and the
Motion, which constitutes the highest life, we must consider as two
genera; for even though they form a unity, they are separable to
thought which finds their unity not a unity; otherwise, it could not
distinguish them.

<P>Observe also how in other things Motion or life is clearly
separated from Being- a separation impossible, doubtless, in True
Being, but possible in its shadow and namesake. In the portrait of a
man much is left out, and above all the essential thing, life: the
"Being" of sensible things just such a shadow of True Being, an
abstraction from that Being complete which was life in the
Archetype; it is because of this incompleteness that we are able in
the Sensible world to separate Being from life and life from Being.

<P>Being, then, containing many species, has but one genus. Motion,
however, is to be classed as neither a subordinate nor a 
supplement of
Being but as its concomitant; for we have not found Being serving as
substrate to Motion. Motion is being Act; neither is separated from
the other except in thought; the two natures are one; for Being is
inevitably actual, not potential.

<P>No doubt we observe Motion and Being separately, Motion as
contained in Being and Being as involved in Motion, and in the
individual they may be mutually exclusive; but the dualism is an
affirmation of our thought only, and that thought sees either form
as a duality within a unity.

<P>Now Motion, thus manifested in conjunction with Being, does not
alter Being's nature- unless to complete its essential character-
and it does retain for ever its own peculiar nature: at 
once, then, we
are forced to introduce Stability. To reject Stability would be more
unreasonable than to reject Motion; for Stability is 
associated in our
thought and conception with Being even more than with Motion;
unalterable condition, unchanging mode, single 
Reason-Principle- these
are characteristics of the higher sphere.

<P>Stability, then, may also be taken as a single genus. Obviously
distinct from Motion and perhaps even its contrary, that it is also
distinct from Being may be shown by many considerations. We may
especially observe that if Stability were identical with Being, so
also would Motion be, with equal right. Why identity in the case of
Stability and not in that of Motion, when Motion is 
virtually the very
life and Act both of Substance and of Absolute Being? However, on
the very same principle on which we separated Motion from Being with
the understanding that it is the same and not the same- that they
are two and yet one- we also separate Stability from Being, holding
it, yet, inseparable; it is only a logical separation entailing the
inclusion among the Existents of this other genus. To identify
Stability with Being, with no difference between them, and 
to identify
Being with Motion, would be to identify Stability with Motion
through the mediation of Being, and so to make Motion and Stability
one and the same thing.
