<P>4. But how explain beings by the side of Being, and the 
variety of
intelligences and of souls, when Being has the unity of omnipresent
identity and not merely that of a species, and when 
intellect and soul
are likewise numerically one? We certainly distinguish between the
soul of the All and the particular souls.

<P>This seems to conflict with our view which, moreover, for all
its logical necessity, scarcely carries conviction against our
mental reluctance to the notion of unity identically omnipresent. It
would appear more plausible to suppose a partition of the All-the
original remaining undiminished- or, in a more legitimate phrase, an
engendering from the All.

<P>Thus the Authentic would be left self-gathered, while what we
think of as the parts- the separate souls- would come into being to
produce the multiple total of the universe.

<P>But if the Authentic Being is to be kept unattached in order to
remove the difficulty of integral omnipresence, the same
considerations must apply equally to the souls; we would 
have to admit
that they cannot be integrally omnipresent in the bodies they are
described as occupying; either, soul must be distributed, part to
body's part, or it is lodged entire at some one point in the body
giving forth some of its powers to the other points; and these very
powers, again, present the same difficulty.

<P>A further objection is that some one spot in the body will hold
the soul, the others no more than a power from it.

<P>Still, how account for the many souls, many intelligences, the
beings by the side of the Being?

<P>No doubt the beings proceed from the Priors in the mode only of
numerical distinction and not as concrete masses, but the difficulty
remains as to how they come to constitute the plenitude of the
material universe.

<P>This explanation by progression does not clear the problem.

<P>We are agreed that diversity within the Authentic 
depends not upon
spatial separation but sheerly upon differentiation; all Being,
despite this plurality, is a unity still; "Being neighbours Being";
all holds together; and thus the Intellectual-Principle [which is
Being and the Beings] remains an integral, multiple by
differentiation, not by spatial distinction.

<P>Soul too? Souls too. That principle distributed over material
masses we hold to be in its own nature incapable of distribution;
the magnitude belongs to the masses; when this soul-principle enters
into them- or rather they into it- it is thought of as distributable
only because, within the discrimination of the corporeal, the
animating force is to be recognised at any and every point. For soul
is not articulated, section of soul to section of body; there is
integral omnipresence manifesting the unity of that principle, its
veritable partlessness.

<P>Now as in soul unity does not debar variety, so with 
Being and the
Beings; in that order multiplicity does not conflict with unity.
Multiplicity. This is not due to the need of flooding the universe
with life; nor is the extension of the corporeal the cause of the
multiplicity of souls; before body existed, soul was one and 
many; the
many souls fore-existed in the All not potentially but each
effectively; that one collective soul is no bar to the variety; the
variety does not abrogate the unity; the souls are apart without
partition, present each to all as never having been set in 
opposition;
they are no more hedged off by boundaries than are the multiple
items of knowledge in one mind; the one soul so exists as to include
all souls; the nature of such a principle must be utterly free of
boundary.
