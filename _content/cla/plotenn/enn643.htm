<P>5. Man, thus, must be some Reason-Principle other than soul. But
why should he not be some conjoint- a soul in a certain
Reason-Principle- the Reason-Principle being, as it were, a definite
activity which however could not exist without that which acts?

<P>This is the case with the Reason-Principles in seed which are
neither soulless nor entirely soul. For these productive principles
cannot be devoid of soul and there is nothing surprising in such
essences being Reason-Principles.

<P>But these principles producing other forms than man, of 
what phase
of soul are they activities? Of the vegetal soul? Rather of 
that which
produces animal life, a brighter soul and therefore one more 
intensely
living.

<P>The soul of that order, the soul that has entered into Matter of
that order, is man by having, apart from body, a certain
disposition; within body it shapes all to its own fashion, producing
another form of Man, man reduced to what body admits, just as an
artist may make a reduced image of that again.

<P>It is soul, then, that holds the pattern and Reason-Principles
of Man, the natural tendencies, the dispositions and powers- all
feeble since this is not the Primal Man- and it contains also the
Ideal-Forms of other senses, Forms which themselves are 
senses, bright
to all seeming but images, and dim in comparison with those of the
earlier order.

<P>The higher Man, above this sphere, rises from the more godlike
soul, a soul possessed of a nobler humanity and brighter
perceptions. This must be the Man of Plato's definition ["Man is
Soul"], where the addition "Soul as using body" marks the
distinction between the soul which uses body directly and the soul,
poised above, which touches body only through that intermediary.

<P>The Man of the realm of birth has sense-perception: the higher
soul enters to bestow a brighter life, or rather does not so much
enter as simply impart itself; for soul does not leave the
Intellectual but, maintaining that contact, holds the lower life as
pendant from it, blending with it by the natural link of
Reason-Principle to Reason-Principle: and man, the dimmer, brightens
under that illumination.
