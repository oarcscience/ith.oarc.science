<P>15. The further question, therefore, is raised whether
boundlessness and indetermination are things lodging in something
other than themselves as a sort of attribute and whether 
Privation [or
Negation of quality] is also an attribute residing in some separate
substratum.

<P>Now all that is Number and Reason-Principle is outside of
boundlessness: these bestow bound and settlement and order in
general upon all else: neither anything that has been brought under
order nor any Order-Absolute is needed to bring them under order.
The thing that has to be brought under order [e.g., Matter] is other
than the Ordering Principle which is Limit and Definiteness and
Reason-Principle. Therefore, necessarily, the thing to be brought
under order and to definiteness must be in itself a thing lacking
delimitation.

<P>Now Matter is a thing that is brought under order- like all that
shares its nature by participation or by possessing the same
principle- therefore, necessarily, Matter is The Undelimited and not
merely the recipient of a nonessential quality of Indefiniteness
entering as an attribute.

<P>For, first, any attribute to any subject must be a
Reason-Principle; and Indefiniteness is not a Reason-Principle.

<P>Secondly, what must a thing be to take Indefiniteness as an
attribute? Obviously it must, beforehand, be either Definiteness or
a defined thing. But Matter is neither.

<P>Then again Indefiniteness entering as an attribute into the
definite must cease to be indefinite: but Indefiniteness has not
entered as an attribute into Matter: that is, Matter is essentially
Indefiniteness.

<P>The Matter even of the Intellectual Realm is the Indefinite,
[the undelimited]; it must be a thing generated by the undefined
nature, the illimitable nature, of the Eternal Being, The One
illimitableness, however, not possessing native existence There but
engendered by The One.

<P>But how can Matter be common to both spheres, be here and be
There?

<P>Because even Indefiniteness has two phases.

<P>But what difference can there be between phase and phase of
Indefiniteness?

<P>The difference of archetype and image.

<P>So that Matter here [as only an image of Indefiniteness] would
be less indefinite?

<P>On the contrary, more indefinite as an Image-thing remote from
true being. Indefiniteness is the greater in the less ordered
object; the less deep in good, the deeper in evil. The Indeterminate
in the Intellectual Realm, where there is truer being, might 
almost be
called merely an Image of Indefiniteness: in this lower Sphere where
there is less Being, where there is a refusal of the 
Authentic, and an
adoption of the Image-Kind, Indefiniteness is more authentically
indefinite.

<P>But this argument seems to make no difference between the
indefinite object and Indefiniteness-essential. Is there none?

<P>In any object in which Reason and Matter co-exist we distinguish
between Indeterminateness and the Indeterminate subject: but where
Matter stands alone we make them identical, or, better, we would say
right out that in that case essential Indeterminateness is not
present; for it is a Reason-Principle and could not lodge in the
indeterminate object without at once annulling the indeterminateness.

<P>Matter, then, must be described as Indefinite of itself, by its
natural opposition to Reason-Principle. Reason is Reason and nothing
else; just so Matter, opposed by its indeterminateness to Reason, is
Indeterminateness and nothing else.
