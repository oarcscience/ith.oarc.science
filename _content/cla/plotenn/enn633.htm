<P>14. To the argument touching relation we have an answer surely
legitimate:

<P>The Unity is not of a nature to lose its own manner of being
only because something else stands in a state which it does 
not itself
share; to stray from its unity it must itself suffer division into
duality or the still wider plurality.

<P>If by division the one identical mass can become a 
duality without
loss of quantity, clearly the unity it possessed and by this
destructive division lost was something distinct. What may be
alternatively present and absent to the same subject must be classed
among Real-Beings, regardless of position; an accidental 
elsewhere, it
must have reality in itself whether it be manifested in things of
sense or in the Intellectual- an accidental in the Laters but
self-existent in the higher, especially in the First in its aspect
of Unity developing into Being. We may be told that Unity may lose
that character without change in itself, becoming duality by
association with something else; but this is not true; unity does
not become two things; neither the added nor what takes the addition
becomes two; each remains the one thing it was; the duality is
predicable of the group only, the unity remaining unchanged 
in each of
those unchanged constituents.

<P>Two and the Dyad are not essentially relative: if the only
condition to the construction of duality were meeting and
association such a relation might perhaps constitute Twoness and
Duality; but in fact we see Duality produced by the very opposite
process, by the splitting apart of a unity. This shows that duality-
or any other such numerical form- is no relation produced either by
scission or association. If one configuration produces a certain
thing it is impossible that the opposite should produce the same so
that the thing may be identified with the relation.

<P>What then is the actual cause?

<P>Unity is due to the presence of Unity; duality to that 
of Duality;
it is precisely as things are white by Whiteness, just by Justice,
beautiful by Beauty. Otherwise we must reject these universals and
call in relation here also: justice would arise from a certain
attitude in a given situation, Beauty from a certain pattern of the
person with nothing present able to produce the beauty, 
nothing coming
from without to effect that agreeable appearance.

<P>You see something which you pronounce to be a unity; that thing
possesses also size, form, and a host of other characteristics you
might name; size, bulk, sweetness, bitterness and other Ideas are
actually present in the thing; it surely cannot be thought 
that, while
every conceivable quality has Real-Being, quantity [Number] has not
and that while continuous quantity exists, discrete quantity does
not and this though continuous quantity is measured by the discrete.
No: as size by the presence of Magnitude, and Oneness by the
presence of Unity, so with Duality and all the other numerical modes.

<P>As to the How of participation, the enquiry is that of all
participation in Ideal Forms; we must note, however, that 
the presence
of the Decad in the looser totals is different from its presence in
the continuous; there is difference again in its presence within
many powers where multiplicity is concentred in unity; arrived at
the Intellectuals, there too we discover Number, the 
Authentic Number,
no longer entering the alien, Decad-Absolute not Decad of some
particular Intellectual group.
