<P>5. But some doubt arises when we consider the phenomena of
hearing.

<P>Perhaps we are to understand the process thus: the air 
is modified
by the first movement; layer by layer it is successively 
acted upon by
the object causing the sound: it finally impinges in that modified
form upon the sense, the entire progression being governed 
by the fact
that all the air from starting point to hearing point is similarly
affected.

<P>Perhaps, on the other hand, the intervenient is modified only by
the accident of its midway position, so that, failing any
intervenient, whatsoever sound two bodies in clash might make would
impinge without medium upon our sense?

<P>Still air is necessary; there could be no sound in the absence
of the air set vibrating in the first movement, however different be
the case with the intervenient from that onwards to the perception
point.

<P>The air would thus appear to be the dominant in the production
of sound: two bodies would clash without even an incipient sound,
but that the air, struck in their rapid meeting and hurled outward,
passes on the movement successively till it reaches the ears and the
sense of hearing.

<P>But if the determinant is the air, and the impression is 
simply of
air-movements, what accounts for the differences among voices and
other sounds? The sound of bronze against bronze is different from
that of bronze against some other substance: and so on; the air and
its vibration remain the one thing, yet the difference in sounds is
much more than a matter of greater or less intensity.

<P>If we decide that sound is caused by a percussion upon the air,
then obviously nothing turning upon the distinctive nature of air is
in question: it sounds at a moment in which it is simply a 
solid body,
until [by its distinctive character] it is sent pulsing 
outwards: thus
air in itself is not essential to the production of sound; 
all is done
by clashing solids as they meet and that percussion, reaching the
sense, is the sound. This is shown also by the sounds formed within
living beings not in air but by the friction of parts; for example,
the grinding of teeth and the crunching of bones against 
each other in
the bending of the body, cases in which the air does not intervene.

<P>But all this may now be left over; we are brought to the same
conclusion as in the case of sight; the phenomena of hearing arise
similarly in a certain co-sensitiveness inherent in a living whole.
