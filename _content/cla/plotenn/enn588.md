#### Section 28

28\. We have already indicated that Activity and Passivity are to be
regarded as motions, and that it is possible to distinguish absolute
motions, actions, passions.

As for the remaining so-called genera, we have shown that they are
reducible to those which we have posited.

With regard to the relative, we have maintained that Relation belongs to
one object as compared with another, that the two objects coexist
simultaneously, and that Relation is found wherever a substance is in
such a condition as to produce it; not that the substance is a relative,
except in so far as it constitutes part of a whole- a hand, for example,
or head or cause or principle or element.

We may also adopt the ancient division of relatives into creative
principles, measures, excesses and deficiencies, and those which in
general separate objects on the basis of similarities and differences.

Our investigation into the kinds of Being is now complete.
