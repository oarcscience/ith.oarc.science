<P>16. But here we may be questioned about these numbers which we
describe as the primal and authentic:

<P>"Where do you place these numbers, in what genus among Beings?
To everyone they seem to come under Quantity and you have certainly
brought Quantity in, where you say that discrete Quantity 
equally with
the continuous holds place among Beings; but you go on to say that
there are the numbers belonging to the Firsts and then talk of other
numbers quite distinct, those of reckoning; tell us how you arrange
all this, for there is difficulty here. And then, the unity in
sense-things- is that a quantity or is quantity here just so many
units brought together, the unity being the starting-point 
of quantity
but not quantity itself? And, if the starting-point, is it a kindred
thing or of another genus? All this you owe it to us to make clear."

<P>Be it so; we begin by pointing out a distinction:

<P>You take one thing with another- for we must first deal with
objects of sense- a dog and a man, or two men; or you take a 
group and
affirm ten, a decad of men: in this case the number affirmed is not a
Reality, even as Reality goes in the sphere of sense, but is purely
Quantity: similarly when you resolve into units, breaking up the
decad, those units are your principle of Quantity since the single
individual is not a unity absolute.

<P>But the case is different when you consider one man in 
himself and
affirm a certain number, duality, for example, in that he is at once
living and reasoning.

<P>By this analysis and totalling, you get quantity; but there are
two objects under consideration and each of these is one; each of
the unities contributes to the complete being and the oneness is
inherent in each; this is another kind of number; number essential;
even the duality so formed is no posterior; it does not signify a
quantity apart from the thing but the quantity in the essence which
holds the thing together. The number here is no mere result of your
detailing; the things exist of themselves and are not 
brought together
by your reckoning, but what has it to do with essential reality that
you count one man in with another? There is here no resultant unity
such as that of a choir- the decad is real only to you who count
the ten; in the ten of your reckoning there cannot be a decad without
a unitary basis; it is you that make the ten by your counting, by
fixing that tenness down to quantity; in choir and army there is
something more than that, something not of your placing.

<P>But how do you come to have a number to place?

<P>The Number inherent apart from any enumeration has its own
manner of being, but the other, that resulting upon the appearance
of an external to be appraised by the Number within yourself, is
either an Act of these inherent numbers or an Act in accordance with
them; in counting we produce number and so bring quantity into being
just as in walking we bring a certain movement into being.

<P>But what of that "Number within us having its own manner of
being"?

<P>It is the Number of our essence. "Our essence" we read "partakes
of Number and harmony and, also, is Number and harmony." 
"Neither body
nor magnitude," someone says: soul, then, is Number since it is
essence. The number belonging to body is an essence of the order of
body; the number belonging to soul constitutes the essences of souls.

<P>In the Intellectuals, all, if the Absolute Living-Form, 
there is a
multiple- a triad, let us say- that Triad of the Living-Form 
is of the
nature of essence: and the Triad prior to any living thing, Triad in
the realm of Being, is a principle of essence.

<P>When you enumerate two things- say, animal and beauty- each of
these remains one thing; the number is your production; it lay
within yourself; it is you that elaborate quantity, here the 
dyad. But
when you declare virtue to be a Tetrad, you are affirming a Tetrad
which does actually exist; the parts, so to speak, make one 
thing; you
are taking as the object of your act a Unity- Tetrad to which you
accommodate the Tetrad within yourself.
