<P>9. But what approach have we to the knowing of Good and Evil?

<P>And first of the Evil of soul: Virtue, we may know by the
Intellectual-Principle and by means of the philosophic habit; but
Vice?

<P>A a ruler marks off straight from crooked, so Vice is 
known by its
divergence from the line of Virtue.

<P>But are we able to affirm Vice by any vision we can have 
of it, or
is there some other way of knowing it?

<P>Utter viciousness, certainly not by any vision, for it is
utterly outside of bound and measure; this thing which is nowhere
can be seized only by abstraction; but any degree of evil falling
short of The Absolute is knowable by the extent of that 
falling short.

<P>We see partial wrong; from what is before us we divine that
which is lacking to the entire form [or Kind] thus indicated; we see
that the completed Kind would be the Indeterminate; by this 
process we
are able to identify and affirm Evil. In the same way when we
observe what we feel to be an ugly appearance in Matter- left there
because the Reason-Principle has not become so completely the master
as to cover over the unseemliness- we  recognise Ugliness by the
falling-short from Ideal-Form.

<P>But how can we identify what has never had any touch of Form?

<P>We utterly eliminate every kind of Form; and the object in which
there is none whatever we call Matter: if we are to see 
Matter we must
so completely abolish Form that we take shapelessness into our very
selves.

<P>In fact it is another Intellectual-Principle, not the true, this
which ventures a vision so uncongenial.

<P>To see darkness the eye withdraws from the light; it is striving
to cease from seeing, therefore it abandons the light which 
would make
the darkness invisible; away from the light its power is rather that
of not-seeing than of seeing and this not-seeing is its nearest
approach to seeing Darkness. So the Intellectual-Principle, in order
to see its contrary [Matter], must leave its own light locked up
within itself, and as it were go forth from itself into an outside
realm, it must ignore its native brightness and submit itself to the
very contradition of its being.
