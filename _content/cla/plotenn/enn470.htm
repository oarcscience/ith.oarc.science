<P>4. Another consideration is that if The Good [and First] is
simplex and without need, it can neither need the 
intellective act nor
possess what it does not need: it will therefore not have
intellection. (Interpolation or corruption: It is without 
intellection
because, also, it contains no duality.)

<P>Again; an Intellectual-Principle is distinct from The Good and
takes a certain goodness only by its intellection of The Good.

<P>Yet again: In any dual object there is the unity [the 
principle of
identity] side by side with the rest of the thing; an associated
member cannot be the unity of the two and there must be a
self-standing unity [within the duality] before this unity of
members can exist: by the same reasoning there must be also the
supreme unity entering into no association whatever, something which
is unity-simplex by its very being, utterly devoid of all 
that belongs
to the thing capable of association.

<P>How could anything be present in anything else unless in 
virtue of
a source existing independently of association? The simplex [or
absolute] requires no derivation; but any manifold, or any dual,
must be dependent.

<P>We may use the figure of, first, light; then, following it, the
sun; as a third, the orb of the moon taking its light from the sun:
Soul carries the Intellectual-Principle as something imparted and
lending the light which makes it essentially intellective;
Intellectual-Principle carries the light as its own though it is not
purely the light but is the being into whose very essence the light
has been received; highest is That which, giving forth the light to
its sequent, is no other than the pure light itself by whose 
power the
Intellectual-Principle takes character.

<P>How can this highest have need of any other? It is not to be
identified with any of the things that enter into association; the
self-standing is of a very different order.
