<P>28. Is memory vested in the faculty by which we perceive and
learn? Or does it reside in the faculty by which we set things
before our minds as objects of desire or of anger, the passionate
faculty?

<P>This will be maintained on the ground that there could 
scarcely be
both a first faculty in direct action and a second to remember what
that first experiences. It is certain that the desiring 
faculty is apt
to be stirred by what it has once enjoyed; the object presents
itself again; evidently, memory is at work; why else, the same
object with the same attraction?

<P>But, at that, we might reasonably ascribe to the desiring
faculty the very perception of the desired objects and then 
the desire
itself to the perceptive faculty, and so on all through, and in the
end conclude that the distinctive names merely indicate the function
which happens to be uppermost.

<P>Yet the perception is very different from faculty to faculty;
certainly it is sight and not desire that sees the object; desire is
stirred merely as a result of the seeing, by a transmission; its act
is not in the nature of an identification of an object seen; all is
simply blind response [automatic reaction]. Similarly with 
rage; sight
reveals the offender and the passion leaps; we may think of 
a shepherd
seeing a wolf at his flock, and a dog, seeing nothing, who springs to
the scent or the sound.

<P>In other words the desiring faculty has had the emotion, but the
trace it keeps of the event is not a memory; it is a condition,
something passively accepted: there is another faculty that was
aware of the enjoyment and retains the memory of what has happened.
This is confirmed by the fact that many satisfactions which the
desiring faculty has enjoyed are not retained in the memory: 
if memory
resided in the desiring faculty, such forgetfulness could not be.
