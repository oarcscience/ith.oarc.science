<P>8. If, then, the Intellection is an act upon the inner 
content [of
a perfect unity], that content is at once the Idea [as object:
eidos] and the Idea itself [as concept: idea].

<P>What, then, is that content?

<P>An Intellectual-Principle and an Intellective Essence, no
concept distinguishable from the Intellectual-Principle, 
each actually
being that Principle. The Intellectual-Principle entire is the total
of the Ideas, and each of them is the [entire]
Intellectual-Principle in a special form. Thus a science 
entire is the
total of the relevant considerations each of which, again, 
is a member
of the entire science, a member not distinct in space yet having its
individual efficacy in a total.

<P>This Intellectual-Principle, therefore, is a unity while by that
possession of itself it is, tranquilly, the eternal abundance.

<P>If the Intellectual-Principle were envisaged as preceding Being,
it would at once become a principle whose expression, its 
intellectual
Act, achieves and engenders the Beings: but, since we are 
compelled to
think of existence as preceding that which knows it, we can but
think that the Beings are the actual content of the knowing
principle and that the very act, the intellection, is inherent to
the Beings, as fire stands equipped from the beginning with
fire-act; in this conception, the Beings contain the
Intellectual-Principle as one and the same with themselves, as their
own activity. Thus, Being is itself an activity: there is one
activity, then, in both or, rather, both are one thing.

<P>Being, therefore, and the Intellectual-Principle are one Nature:
the Beings, and the Act of that which is, and the
Intellectual-Principle thus constituted, all are one: and the
resultant Intellections are the Idea of Being and its shape and its
act.

<P>It is our separating habit that sets the one order before the
other: for there is a separating intellect, of another order than
the true, distinct from the intellect, inseparable and unseparating,
which is Being and the universe of things.
