<P>14. On the nature of the Intellectual-Principle we get light
from its manifestations; they show that it demands such diversity as
is compatible with its being a monad. Take what principle you will,
that of plant or animal: if this principle were a pure unity 
and not a
specifically varied thing, it could not so serve as principle; its
product would be Matter, the principle not having taken all those
forms necessary if Matter is to be permeated and utterly
transformed. A face is not one mass; there are nose and eyes; and
the nose is not a unity but has the differences which make it a
nose; as bare unity it would be mere mass.

<P>There is infinity in Intellectual-Principle since, of its very
nature, it is a multiple unity, not with the unity of a 
house but with
that of a Reason-Principle, multiple in itself: in the one
Intellectual design it includes within itself, as it were in
outline, all the outlines, all the patterns. All is within 
it, all the
powers and intellections; the division is not determined by 
a boundary
but goes ever inward; this content is held as the living universe
holds the natural forms of the living creatures in it from the
greatest to the least, down even to the minutest powers 
where there is
a halt at the individual form. The discrimination is not of items
huddled within a sort of unity; this is what is known as the 
Universal
Sympathy, not of course the sympathy known here which is a copy and
prevails amongst things in separation; that authentic Sympathy
consists in all being a unity and never discriminate.
