<P>4. Then consider this god [in man] whom we cannot think to be
absent at some point and present at another. All that have insight
into the nature of the divine beings hold the omnipresence 
of this god
and of all the gods, and reason assures us that so it must be.

<P>Now all-pervasion is inconsistent with partition; that would
mean no longer the god throughout but part of the god at one 
point and
part at another; the god ceases to be one god, just as a mass cut up
ceases to be a mass, the parts no longer giving the first total.
Further, the god becomes corporeal.

<P>If all this is impossible, the disputed doctrine presents itself
again; holding the god to pervade the Being of man, we hold the
omnipresence of an integral identity.

<P>Again, if we think of the divine nature as infinite- and 
certainly
it is confined by no bounds- this must mean that it nowhere 
fails; its
presence must reach to everything; at the point to which it does not
reach, there it has failed; something exists in which it is not.

<P>Now, admitting any sequent to the absolute unity, that sequent
must be bound up with the absolute; any third will be about that
second and move towards it, linked to it as its offspring. 
In this way
all participants in the Later will have share in the First. 
The Beings
of the Intellectual are thus a plurality of firsts and seconds and
thirds attached like one sphere to one centre, not separated by
interval but mutually present; where, therefore, the Intellectual
tertiaries are present, the secondaries and firsts are present too.
