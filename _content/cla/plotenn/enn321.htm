<P>2. Enough on that point: we come now to the question of memory
of the personality?

<P>There will not even be memory of the personality; no thought
that the contemplator is the self- Socrates, for example- or that it
is Intellect or Soul. In this connection it should be borne in mind
that, in contemplative vision, especially when it is vivid, 
we are not
at the time aware of our own personality; we are in possession of
ourselves but the activity is towards the object of vision with
which the thinker becomes identified; he has made himself over as
matter to be shaped; he takes ideal form under the action of the
vision while remaining, potentially, himself. This means that he is
actively himself when he has intellection of nothing.

<P>Or, if he is himself [pure and simple], he is empty of 
all: if, on
the contrary, he is himself [by the self-possession of
contemplation] in such a way as to be identified with what is all,
then by the act of self-intellection he has the simultaneous
intellection of all: in such a case self-intuition by personal
activity brings the intellection, not merely of the self, but also
of the total therein embraced; and similarly the intuition of the
total of things brings that of the personal self as included among
all.

<P>But such a process would appear to introduce into the 
Intellectual
that element of change against which we ourselves have only now been
protesting?

<P>The answer is that, while unchangeable identity is essential to
the Intellectual-Principle, the soul, lying so to speak on 
the borders
of the Intellectual Realm, is amenable to change; it has, 
for example,
its inward advance, and obviously anything that attains position
near to something motionless does so by a change directed 
towards that
unchanging goal and is not itself motionless in the same degree. Nor
is it really change to turn from the self to the constituents of
self or from those constituents to the self; and in this case the
contemplator is the total; the duality has become unity.

<P>None the less the soul, even in the Intellectual Realm, is under
the dispensation of a variety confronting it and a content 
of its own?

<P>No: once pure in the Intellectual, it too possesses that same
unchangeableness: for it possesses identity of essence; when it is
in that region it must of necessity enter into oneness with the
Intellectual-Principle by the sheer fact of its self-orientation,
for by that intention all interval disappears; the soul advances and
is taken into unison, and in that association becomes one with the
Intellectual-Principle- but not to its own destruction: the two are
one, and two. In such a state there is no question of stage and
change: the soul, without motion [but by right of its 
essential being]
would be intent upon its intellectual act, and in possession,
simultaneously, of its self-awareness; for it has become one
simultaneous existence with the Supreme.
