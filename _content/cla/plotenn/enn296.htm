<P>10. In view of all this we must now work back from the items to
the unit, and consider the entire scheme as one enduring thing.

<P>We ascend from air, light, sun- or, moon and light and sun- in
detail, to these things as constituting a total- though a total of
degrees, primary, secondary, tertiary. Thence we come to the
[kosmic] Soul, always the one undiscriminated entity. At 
this point in
our survey we have before us the over-world and all that follows
upon it. That suite [the lower and material world] we take to be the
very last effect that has penetrated to its furthest reach.

<P>Our knowledge of the first is gained from the ultimate of all,
from the very shadow cast by the fire, because this ultimate [the
material world] itself receives its share of the general light,
something of the nature of the Forming-Idea hovering over the
outcast that at first lay in blank obscurity. It is brought under
the scheme of reason by the efficacy of soul whose entire extension
latently holds this rationalizing power. As we know, the
Reason-Principles carried in animal seed fashion and shape living
beings into so many universes in the small. For whatsoever touches
soul is moulded to the nature of soul's own Real-Being.

<P>We are not to think that the Soul acts upon the object by
conformity to any external judgement; there is no pause for 
willing or
planning: any such procedure would not be an act of sheer nature,
but one of applied art: but art is of later origin than 
soul; it is an
imitator, producing dim and feeble copies- toys, things of no great
worth- and it is dependent upon all sorts of mechanism by which
alone its images can be produced. The soul, on the contrary, is
sovereign over material things by might of Real-Being; their quality
is determined by its lead, and those elementary things cannot stand
against its will. On the later level, things are hindered one by the
other, and thus often fall short of the characteristic shape at
which their unextended Reason-Principle must be aiming; in that
other world [under the soul but above the material] the entire shape
[as well as the idea] comes from soul, and all that is produced
takes and keeps its appointed place in a unity, so that the 
engendered
thing, without labour as without clash, becomes all that it 
should be.
In that world the soul has elaborated its creation, the images of
the gods, dwellings for men, each existing to some peculiar purpose.

<P>Soul could produce none but the things which truly represent its
powers: fire produces warmth; another source produces cold; 
soul has a
double efficacy, its act within itself, and its act from within
outwards towards the new production.

<P>In soulless entities, the outgo [natural to everything] remains
dormant, and any efficiency they have is to bring to their own
likeness whatever is amenable to their act. All existence has this
tendency to bring other things to likeness; but the soul has the
distinction of possessing at once an action of conscious attention
within itself, and an action towards the outer. It has thus the
function of giving life to all that does not live by prior right,
and the life it gives is commensurate with its own; that is to say,
living in reason, it communicates reason to the body- an image of
the reason within itself, just as the life given to the body is an
image of Real-Being- and it bestows, also, upon that material the
appropriate shapes of which it contains the Reason-Forms.

<P>The content of the creative soul includes the Ideal 
shapes of gods
and of all else: and hence it is that the kosmos contains all.
