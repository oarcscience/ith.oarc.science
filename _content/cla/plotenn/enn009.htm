<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 6</H4>

<P>6. It may seem reasonable to lay down as a law that when any
powers are contained by a recipient, every action or state
expressive of them must be the action or state of that 
recipient, they
themselves remaining unaffected as merely furnishing efficiency.

<P>But if this were so, then, since the Animate is the recipient of
the Causing-Principle [i.e., the Soul] which brings life to the
Couplement, this Cause must itself remain unaffected, all the
experiences and expressive activities of the life being vested in
the recipient, the Animate.

<P>But this would mean that life itself belongs not to the Soul but
to the Couplement; or at least the life of the Couplement 
would not be
the life of the Soul; Sense-Perception would belong not to the
Sensitive-Faculty but to the container of the faculty.

<P>But if sensation is a movement traversing the body and 
culminating
in Soul, how the soul lack sensation? The very presence of the
Sensitive-Faculty must assure sensation to the Soul.

<P>Once again, where is Sense-Perception seated?

<P>In the Couplement.

<P>Yet how can the Couplement have sensation independently of
action in the Sensitive-Faculty, the Soul left out of count and the
Soul-Faculty?
