<P>2. A cardinal question is where we are to place the freedom of
action ascribed to us.

<P>It must be founded in impulse or in some appetite, as when we
act or omit in lust or rage or upon some calculation of advantage
accompanied by desire.

<P>But if rage or desire implied freedom we must allow freedom to
animals, infants, maniacs, the distraught, the victims of
malpractice producing incontrollable delusions. And if freedom turns
on calculation with desire, does this include faulty calculation?
Sound calculation, no doubt, and sound desire; but then comes the
question whether the appetite stirs the calculation or the 
calculation
the appetite.

<P>Where the appetites are dictated by the very nature they are the
desires of the conjoint of soul and body and then soul lies under
physical compulsions: if they spring in the soul as an independent,
then much that we take to be voluntary is in reality outside of our
free act. Further, every emotion is preceded by some meagre 
reasoning;
how then can a compelling imagination, an appetite drawing 
us where it
will, be supposed to leave us masters in the ensuing act? Need,
inexorably craving satisfaction, is not free in face of that to
which it is forced: and how at all can a thing have efficiency of
its own when it rises from an extern, has an extern for very
principle, thence taking its Being as it stands? It lives by that
extern, lives as it has been moulded: if this be freedom, there is
freedom in even the soulless; fire acts in accordance with its
characteristic being.

<P>We may be reminded that the Living Form and the soul know what
they do. But, if this is knowledge by perception, it does not help
towards the freedom of the act; perception gives awareness, not
mastery: if true knowing is meant, either this is the knowing of
something happening- once more awareness- with the motive- 
force still
to seek, or the reasoning and knowledge have acted to quell the
appetite; then we have to ask to what this repression is to be
referred and where it has taken place. If it is that the mental
process sets up an opposing desire we must assure ourselves 
how; if it
merely stills the appetite with no further efficiency and this is
our freedom, then freedom does not depend upon act but is a thing of
the mind- and in truth all that has to do with act, the very most
reasonable, is still of mixed value and cannot carry freedom.
