<P>4. But there is yet another way to this knowledge:

<P>Admiring the world of sense as we look out upon its vastness and
beauty and the order of its eternal march, thinking of the 
gods within
it, seen and hidden, and the celestial spirits and all the life of
animal and plant, let us mount to its archetype, to the yet more
authentic sphere: there we are to contemplate all things as 
members of
the Intellectual- eternal in their own right, vested with a
self-springing consciousness and life- and, presiding over all
these, the unsoiled Intelligence and the unapproachable wisdom.

<P>That archetypal world is the true Golden Age, age of Kronos, who
is the Intellectual-Principle as being the offspring or exuberance
of God. For here is contained all that is immortal: nothing here but
is Divine Mind; all is God; this is the place of every soul. Here is
rest unbroken: for how can that seek change, in which all is well;
what need that reach to, which holds all within itself; what
increase can that desire, which stands utterly achieved? All its
content, thus, is perfect, that itself may be perfect throughout, as
holding nothing that is less than the divine, nothing that is less
than intellective. Its knowing is not by search but by 
possession, its
blessedness inherent, not acquired; for all belongs to it eternally
and it holds the authentic Eternity imitated by Time which, circling
round the Soul, makes towards the new thing and passes by the old.
Soul deals with thing after thing- now Socrates; now a horse: always
some one entity from among beings- but the Intellectual-Principle is
all and therefore its entire content is simultaneously 
present in that
identity: this is pure being in eternal actuality; nowhere is there
any future, for every then is a now; nor is there any past, for
nothing there has ever ceased to be; everything has taken its stand
for ever, an identity well pleased, we might say, to be as it is;
and everything, in that entire content, is Intellectual-Principle
and Authentic Existence; and the total of all is
Intellectual-Principle entire and Being entire. 
Intellectual-Principle
by its intellective act establishes Being, which in turn, as the
object of intellection, becomes the cause of intellection and of
existence to the Intellectual-Principle- though, of course, there is
another cause of intellection which is also a cause to Being, both
rising in a source distinct from either.

<P>Now while these two are coalescents, having their existence in
common, and are never apart, still the unity they form is two-sided;
there is Intellectual-Principle as against Being, the intellectual
agent as against the object of intellection; we consider the
intellective act and we have the Intellectual-Principle; we think of
the object of that act and we have Being.

<P>Such difference there must be if there is to be any
intellection; but similarly there must also be identity [since, in
perfect knowing, subject and object are identical.]

<P>Thus the Primals [the first "Categories"] are seen to be:
Intellectual-Principle; Existence; Difference; Identity: we must
include also Motion and Rest: Motion provides for the intellectual
act, Rest preserves identity as Difference gives at once a Knower
and a Known, for, failing this, all is one, and silent.

<P>So too the objects of intellection [the ideal content of the
Divine Mind]- identical in virtue of the self-concentration of the
principle which is their common ground- must still be distinct each
from another; this distinction constitutes Difference.

<P>The Intellectual Kosmos thus a manifold, Number and Quantity
arise: Quality is the specific character of each of these ideas
which stand as the principles from which all else derives.
