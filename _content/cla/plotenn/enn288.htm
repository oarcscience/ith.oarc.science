<P>2. To this our first answer is that to place certain things
under one identical class- by admitting an identical range of
operation- is to make them of one common species, and puts an end to
all mention of part; the reasonable conclusion would be, on the
contrary, that there is one identical soul, every separate
manifestation being that soul complete.

<P>Our opponents after first admitting the unity go on to make our
soul dependent on something else, something in which we have 
no longer
the soul of this or that, even of the universe, but a soul 
of nowhere,
a soul belonging neither to the kosmos, nor to anything else, and
yet vested with all the function inherent to the kosmic soul and to
that of every ensouled thing.

<P>The soul considered as an entirety cannot be a soul of any one
given thing- since it is an Essence [a divine Real-Being]- or, at
least, there must be a soul which is not exclusively the soul of any
particular thing, and those attached to particulars must so belong
merely in some mode of accident.

<P>In such questions as this it is important to clarify the
significance of "part."

<P>Part, as understood of body- uniform or varied- need not detain
us; it is enough to indicate that, when part is mentioned in respect
of things whose members are alike, it refers to mass and not to
ideal-form [specific idea]: take for example, whiteness: the 
whiteness
in a portion of milk is not a part of the whiteness of milk in
general: we have the whiteness of a portion not a portion of
whiteness; for whiteness is utterly without magnitude; has nothing
whatever to do with quantity.

<P>That is all we need say with regard to part in material things;
but part in the unembodied may be taken in various ways. We may
think of it in the sense familiar in numbers, "two" a part of the
standard "ten"- in abstract numbers of course- or as we think of a
segment of a circle, or line [abstractly considered], or, again, of
a section or branch of knowledge.

<P>In the case of the units of reckoning and of geometrical figure,
exactly as in that of corporeal masses, partition must diminish the
total; the part must be less than the whole; for these are things of
quantity, and have their being as things of quantity; and- since
they are not the ideal-form Quantity- they are subject to 
increase and
decrease.

<P>Now in such a sense as this, part cannot be affirmed of the soul.

<P>The soul is not a thing of quantity; we are not to 
conceive of the
All-Soul as some standard ten with particular souls as its 
constituent
units.

<P>Such a conception would entail many absurdities:

<P>The Ten could not be [essentially] a unity [the Soul would be an
aggregation, not a self-standing Real-Being] and, further- unless
every one of the single constituents were itself an All-Soul- the
All-Soul would be formed of non-souls.

<P>Again, it is admitted that the particular soul- this "part of
the All-Soul- is of one ideal-form with it, but this does not entail
the relation of part to whole, since in objects formed of continuous
parts there is nothing inevitably making any portion uniform with
the total: take, for example, the parts of a circle or square; we
may divide it in different ways so as to get our part; a 
triangle need
not be divided into triangles; all sorts of different figures are
possible: yet an absolute uniformity is admitted to reign throughout
soul.

<P>In a line, no doubt, the part is inevitably a line; but even
here there is a necessary difference in size; and if, in the case of
the soul we similarly called upon magnitude as the 
distinction between
constituents and collective soul, then soul, thus classed by 
magnitude
becomes quantitative, and is simply body.

<P>But it is admitted that all souls are alike and are entireties;
clearly, soul is not subject to part in the sense in which
magnitudes are: our opponents themselves would not consent to the
notion of the All-Soul being whittled down into fragments, 
yet this is
what they would be doing, annulling the All-Soul- if any collective
soul existed at all- making it a mere piece of terminology, thinking
of it like wine separated into many portions, each portion, in its
jar, being described as a portion of the total thing, wine.

<P>Next there is the conception of the individual soul as a part in
the sense in which we speak of some single proposition as a part of
the science entire.

<P>The theorem is separate, but the science stands as one undivided
thing, the expression and summed efficiency [energy] of each
constituent notion: this is partition without severance; each item
potentially includes the whole science, which itself remains an
unbroken total.

<P>Is this the appropriate parallel?

<P>No; in such a relationship the All-Soul, of which the particular
souls are to be a part, would not be the soul of any definite thing,
but an entity standing aloof; that means that it would not 
even be the
soul of the Kosmos; it would, in fact, be, itself, one of those
partial souls; thus all alike would be partial and of one 
nature; and,
at that, there would be no reason for making any such distinction.
