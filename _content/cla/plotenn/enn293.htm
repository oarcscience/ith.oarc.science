<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 7</H4>

<P>7. So far, so good: but what of the passage in the Philebus
taken to imply that the other souls are parts of the All-Soul?

<P>The statement there made does not bear the meaning read into it;
it expresses only, what the author was then concerned with, that the
heavens are ensouled- a teaching which he maintains in the 
observation
that it is preposterous to make the heavens soulless when we, who
contain a part of the body of the All, have a soul; how, he asks,
could there be soul in the part and none in the total.

<P>He makes his teaching quite clear in the Timaeus, where he shows
us the other souls brought into existence after the All-Soul, but
compounded from the same mixing bowl"; secondary and 
tertiary are duly
marked off from the primal but every form of soul is presented as
being of identical ideal-nature with the All-Soul.

<P>As for saying of the Phaedrus. "All that is soul cares for all
that is soulless," this simply tells us that the corporeal 
kind cannot
be controlled- fashioned, set in place or brought into being- by
anything but the Soul. And we cannot think that there is one soul
whose nature includes this power and another without it. "The
perfect soul, that of the All," we read, "going its lofty journey,
operates upon the kosmos not by sinking into it, but, as it were, by
brooding over it"; and "every perfect soul exercises this 
governance";
he distinguishes the other, the soul in this sphere as "the soul
when its wing is broken."

<P>As for our souls being entrained in the kosmic circuit, 
and taking
character and condition thence; this is no indication that they are
parts: soul-nature may very well take some tincture from even the
qualities of place, from water and from air; residence in 
this city or
in that, and the varying make-up of the body may have their
influence [upon our human souls which, yet, are no parts of place or
of body].

<P>We have always admitted that as members of the universe we take
over something from the All-Soul; we do not deny the influence of
the Kosmic Circuit; but against all this we oppose another soul in
us [the Intellectual as distinguished from the merely vitalizing]
proven to be distinct by that power of opposition.

<P>As for our being begotten children of the kosmos, we answer that
in motherhood the entrant soul is distinct, is not the mother's.
