<P>12. All that thus proceeds from the supernal combines 
into a unity
and every existing entity takes something from this blended infusion
so that the result is the thing itself plus some quality. The
effluence does not make the horse but adds something to it; for
horse comes by horse, and man by man: the sun plays its part no
doubt in the shaping, but the man has his origin in the
Human-Principle. Outer things have their effect, sometimes 
to hurt and
sometimes to help; like a father, they often contribute to good but
sometimes also to harm; but they do not wrench the human being from
the foundations of its nature; though sometimes Matter is the
dominant, and the human principle takes the second place so 
that there
is a failure to achieve perfection; the Ideal has been attenuated.
