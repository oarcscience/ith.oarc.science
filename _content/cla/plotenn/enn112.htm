<P>10. If all this be true, we must at once admit signification,
though, neither singly nor collectively, can we ascribe to the stars
any efficacy except in what concerns the [material] All and 
in what is
of their own function.

<P>We must admit that the Soul before entering into birth presents
itself bearing with it something of its own, for it could never
touch body except under stress of a powerful inner impulse; we must
admit some element of chance around it from its very entry, since
the moment and conditions are determined by the kosmic 
circuit: and we
must admit some effective power in that circuit itself; it is
co-operative, and completes of its own act the task that belongs to
the All of which everything in the circuit takes the rank 
and function
of a part.
