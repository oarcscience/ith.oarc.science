<P>10. But, it may be said, length of time produces an abundance of
good actions missed by the man whose attainment of the happy state
is recent- if indeed we can think at all of a state of 
happiness where
good actions have been few.

<P>Now to make multiplicity, whether in time or in action,
essential to Happiness is to put it together by combining
non-existents, represented by the past, with some one thing that
actually is. This consideration it was that led us at the very
beginning to place Happiness in the actually existent and on that
basis to launch our enquiry as to whether the higher degree was
determined by the longer time. It might be thought that the
Happiness of longer date must surpass the shorter by virtue of the
greater number of acts it included.

<P>But, to begin with, men quite outside of the active life may
attain the state of felicity, and not in a less but in a greater
degree than men of affairs.

<P>Secondly, the good does not derive from the act itself but from
the inner disposition which prompts the noble conduct: the wise and
good man in his very action harvests the good not by what he does
but by what he is.

<P>A wicked man no less than a Sage may save the country, and the
good of the act is for all alike, no matter whose was the 
saving hand.
The contentment of the Sage does not hang upon such actions and
events: it is his own inner habit that creates at once his felicity
and whatever pleasure may accompany it.

<P>To put Happiness in actions is to put it in things that are
outside virtue and outside the Soul; for the Soul's expression is
not in action but in wisdom, in a contemplative operation within
itself; and this, this alone, is Happiness.
