<P>26. Any conscious being, if the good come to him, will know the
good and affirm his possession of it.

<P>But what if one be deceived?

<P>In that case there must be some resemblance to account for the
error: the good will be the original which the delusion
counterfeited and whenever the true presents itself we turn from the
spurious.

<P>All the striving, all the pain, show that to everything
something is a good: the lifeless finds its share in 
something outside
itself; where there is life the longing for good sets up pursuit;
the very dead are cared for and mourned for by the living; the
living plan for their own good. The witness of attainment is
betterment, cleaving to state, satisfaction, settlement, 
suspension of
pursuit. Here pleasure shows itself inadequate; its choice does not
hold; repeated, it is no longer the same; it demands endless
novelty. The good, worthy of the name, can be no such tasting of the
casual; anyone that takes this kind of thing for the good goes
empty, carrying away nothing but an emotion which the good might
have produced. No one could be content to take his pleasure 
thus in an
emotion over a thing not possessed any more than over a child not
there; I cannot think that those setting their good in bodily
satisfactions find table-pleasure without the meal, or love-pleasure
without intercourse with their chosen, or any pleasure where nothing
is done.
