<P>7. Let us consider once more how it is possible for an 
identity to
extend over a universe. This comes to the question how each
variously placed entity in the multiplicity of the sense order can
have its share in one identical Principle.

<P>The solution is in the reasons given for refusing to distribute
that principle; we are not to parcel it out among the entities of
the multiple; on the contrary, we bring the distributed multiples to
the unity. The unity has not gone forth to them: from their 
dispersion
we are led to think of it as broken up to meet them, but this is to
distribute the controller and container equally over the material
handled.

<P>A hand may very well control an entire mass, a long plank, or
anything of that sort; the control is effective throughout and yet
is not distributed, unit for unit, over the object of control: the
power is felt to reach over the whole area, though the hand is only
hand-long, not taking the extension of the mass it wields; lengthen
the object and, provided that the total is within the strength, the
power handles the new load with no need of distributing itself over
the increased area. Now let us eliminate the corporeal mass of the
hand, retaining the power it exerted: is not that power, the
impartible, present integrally over the entire area of control?

<P>Or imagine a small luminous mass serving as centre to a
transparent sphere, so that the light from within shows upon the
entire outer surface, otherwise unlit: we surely agree that the
inner core of light, intact and immobile, reaches over the entire
outer extension; the single light of that small centre 
illuminates the
whole field. The diffused light is not due to any bodily magnitude
of that central point which illuminates not as body but as body lit,
that is by another kind of power than corporeal quality: let us then
abstract the corporeal mass, retaining the light as power: we can no
longer speak of the light in any particular spot; it is equally
diffused within and throughout the entire sphere. We can no longer
even name the spot it occupied so as to say whence it came or how it
is present; we can but seek and wonder as the search shows us the
light simultaneously present at each and every point in the 
sphere. So
with the sunlight: looking to the corporeal mass you are able to
name the source of the light shining through all the air, 
but what you
see is one identical light in integral omnipresence. Consider too
the refraction of light by which it is thrown away from the line of
incidence; yet, direct or refracted, it is one and the same 
light. And
supposing, as before, that the sun were simply an unembodied
illuminant, the light would no longer be fixed to any one definite
spot: having no starting point, no centre of origin, it would be an
integral unity omnipresent.
