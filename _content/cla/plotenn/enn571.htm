<P>11. Passing to Quantity and the quantum, we have to consider the
view which identifies them with number and magnitude on the ground
that everything quantitative is numbered among Sensible things or
rated by the extension of its substrate: we are here, of course,
discussing not Quantity in isolation, but that which causes 
a piece of
wood to be three yards long and gives the five in "five horses,"

<P>Now we have often maintained that number and magnitude are to be
regarded as the only true quantities, and that Space and Time have
no right to be conceived as quantitative: Time as the measure of
Motion should be assigned to Relation, while Space, being that which
circumscribes Body, is also a relative and falls under the same
category; though continuous, it is, like Motion, not included in
Quantity.

<P>On the other hand, why do we not find in the category of
Quantity "great" and "small"? It is some kind of Quantity which
gives greatness to the great; greatness is not a relative, though
greater and smaller are relatives, since these, like 
doubleness, imply
an external correlative.

<P>What is it, then, which makes a mountain small and a grain of
millet large? Surely, in the first place, "small" is equivalent to
"smaller." It is admitted that the term is applied only to things of
the same kind, and from this admission we may infer that the
mountain is "smaller" rather than "small," and that the grain of
millet is not large in any absolute sense but large for a grain of
millet. In other words, since the comparison is between things of
the same kind, the natural predicate would be a comparative.

<P>Again, why is not beauty classed as a relative? Beauty, unlike
greatness, we regard as absolute and as a quality; "more 
beautiful" is
the relative. Yet even the term "beautiful" may be attached to
something which in a given relation may appear ugly: the beauty of
man, for example, is ugliness when compared with that of the gods;
"the most beautiful of monkeys," we may quote, "is ugly in
comparison with any other type." Nonetheless, a thing is beautiful
in itself; as related to something else it is either more or less
beautiful.

<P>Similarly, an object is great in itself, and its 
greatness is due,
not to any external, but to its own participation in the Absolute
Great.

<P>Are we actually to eliminate the beautiful on the pretext that
there is a more beautiful? No more then must we eliminate the great
because of the greater: the greater can obviously have no existence
whatever apart from the great, just as the more beautiful can have
no existence without the beautiful.
