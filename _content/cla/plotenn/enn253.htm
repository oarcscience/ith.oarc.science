<P>2. What definition are we to give to Eternity?

<P>Can it be identified with the [divine or] Intellectual Substance
itself?

<P>This would be like identifying Time with the Universe of Heavens
and Earth- an opinion, it is true, which appears to have had its
adherents. No doubt we conceive, we know, Eternity as something most
august; most august, too, is the Intellectual Kind; and there is no
possibility of saying that the one is more majestic than the other,
since no such degrees can be asserted in the Above-World; there is
therefore a certain excuse for the identification- all the more
since the Intellectual Substance and Eternity have the one scope and
content.

<P>Still; by the fact of representing the one as contained 
within the
other, by making Eternity a predicate to the Intellectual Existents-
"the Nature of the Exemplar," we read, "is eternal"- we cancel the
identification; Eternity becomes a separate thing, something
surrounding that Nature or lying within it or present to it. And the
majestic quality of both does not prove them identical: it might be
transmitted from the one to the other. So, too, Eternity and the
Divine Nature envelop the same entities, yes; but not in the 
same way:
the Divine may be thought of as enveloping parts, Eternity as
embracing its content in an unbroken whole, with no implication of
part, but merely from the fact that all eternal things are so by
conforming to it.

<P>May we, perhaps, identify Eternity with Repose-There as Time has
been identified with Movement-Here?

<P>This would bring on the counter-question whether Eternity is
presented to us as Repose in the general sense or as the Repose that
envelops the Intellectual Essence.

<P>On the first supposition we can no more talk of Repose being
eternal than of Eternity being eternal: to be eternal is to
participate in an outside thing, Eternity.

<P>Further, if Eternity is Repose, what becomes of Eternal
Movement, which, by this identification, would become a thing of
Repose?

<P>Again, the conception of Repose scarcely seems to include that
of perpetuity- I am speaking of course not of perpetuity in the
time-order (which might follow on absence of movement) but of that
which we have in mind when we speak of Eternity.

<P>If, on the other hand, Eternity is identified with the Repose of
the divine Essence, all species outside of the divine are put
outside of Eternity.

<P>Besides, the conception of Eternity requires not merely 
Repose but
also unity- and, in order to keep it distinct from Time, a unity
including interval- but neither that unity nor that absence of
interval enters into the conception of Repose as such.

<P>Lastly, this unchangeable Repose in unity is a predicate
asserted of Eternity, which, therefore, is not itself Repose, the
absolute, but a participant in Repose.
