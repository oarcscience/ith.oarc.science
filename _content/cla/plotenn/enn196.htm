<P>10. But: if the evil in men is involuntary, if their own will
has not made them what they are, how can we either blame wrong-doers
or even reproach their victims with suffering through their 
own fault?

<P>If there is a Necessity, bringing about human wickedness 
either by
force of the celestial movement or by a rigorous sequence set up by
the First Cause, is not the evil a thin rooted in Nature? And if
thus the Reason-Principle of the universe is the creator of evil,
surely all is injustice?

<P>No: Men are no doubt involuntary sinners in the sense 
that they do
not actually desire to sin; but this does not alter the fact that
wrongdoers, of their own choice, are, themselves, the agents; it is
because they themselves act that the sin is in their own; if 
they were
not agents they could not sin.

<P>The Necessity [held to underlie human wickedness] is not an
outer force [actually compelling the individual], but exists only in
the sense of a universal relationship.

<P>Nor is the force of the celestial Movement such as to leave us
powerless: if the universe were something outside and apart 
from us it
would stand as its makers willed so that, once the gods had 
done their
part, no man, however impious, could introduce anything contrary to
their intention. But, as things are, efficient act does come 
from men:
given the starting Principle, the secondary line, no doubt, is
inevitably completed; but each and every principle 
contributes towards
the sequence. Now Men are Principles, or, at least, they are moved
by their characteristic nature towards all that is good, and that
nature is a Principle, a freely acting cause.
