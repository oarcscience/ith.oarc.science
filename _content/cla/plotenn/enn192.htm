<P>6. As for the disregard of desert- the good afflicted, the
unworthy thriving- it is a sound explanation no doubt that 
to the good
nothing is evil and to the evil nothing can be good: still the
question remains why should what essentially offends our nature fall
to the good while the wicked enjoy all it demands? How can such an
allotment be approved?

<P>No doubt since pleasant conditions add nothing to true happiness
and the unpleasant do not lessen the evil in the wicked, the
conditions matter little: as well complain that a good man happens
to be ugly and a bad man handsome.

<P>Still, under such a dispensation, there would surely be a
propriety, a reasonableness, a regard to merit which, as things are,
do not appear, though this would certainly be in keeping with the
noblest Providence: even though external conditions do not affect a
man's hold upon good or evil, none the less it would seem utterly
unfitting that the bad should be the masters, be sovereign in the
state, while honourable men are slaves: a wicked ruler may commit
the most lawless acts; and in war the worst men have a free hand and
perpetrate every kind of crime against their prisoners.

<P>We are forced to ask how such things can be, under a Providence.
Certainly a maker must consider his work as a whole, but 
none the less
he should see to the due ordering of all the parts, especially when
these parts have Soul, that is, are Living and Reasoning Beings: the
Providence must reach to all the details; its functioning 
must consist
in neglecting no point.

<P>Holding, therefore, as we do, despite all, that the Universe
lies under an Intellectual Principle whose power has touched every
existent, we cannot be absolved from the attempt to show in what way
the detail of this sphere is just.
