<P>10. But failure There? What can defensive horns serve to 
There? To
sufficiency as living form, to completeness. That principle must be
complete as living form, complete as Intellect, complete as life, so
that if it is not to be one thing it may be another. Its
characteristic difference is in this power of being now this, now
that, so that, summing all, it may be the completest life-form,
Intelligence complete, life in greatest fulness with each of the
particulars complete in its degree while yet, over all that
multiplicity, unity reigns.

<P>If all were one identity, the total could not contain 
this variety
of forms; there would be nothing but a self-sufficing unity. Like
every compound it must consist of things progressively differing in
form and safeguarded in that form. This is in the very 
nature of shape
and Reason-Principle; a shape, that of man let us suppose, must
include a certain number of differences of part but all 
dominated by a
unity; there will be the noble and the inferior, eye and finger, but
all within a unity; the part will be inferior in comparison with the
total but best in its place. The Reason-Principle, too, is 
at once the
living form and something else, something distinct from the being of
that form. It is so with virtue also; it contains at once the
universal and the particular; and the total is good because the
universal is not differentiated.
