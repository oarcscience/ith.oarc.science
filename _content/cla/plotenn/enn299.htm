<P>13. The Ineluctable, the Kosmic Law is, thus, rooted in a
natural principle under which each several entity is overruled to
go, duly and in order, towards that place and Kind to which it
characteristically tends, that is towards the image of its primal
choice and constitution.

<P>In that archetypal world every form of soul is near to the image
[the thing in the world of copy] to which its individual
constitution inclines it; there is therefore no need of a sender or
leader acting at the right moment to bring it at the right moment
whether into body or into a definitely appropriate body: of its own
motion it descends at the precisely true time and enters where it
must. To every Soul its own hour; when that strikes it descends and
enters the body suitable to it as at the cry of a herald; thus all
is set stirring and advancing as by a magician's power or by some
mighty traction; it is much as, in any living thing, the soul itself
effects the fulfillment of the natural career, stirring and bringing
forth, in due season, every element- beard, horn, and all the
successive stages of tendency and of output- or, as it leads a tree
through its normal course within set periods.

<P>The Souls go forth neither under compulsion nor of freewill; or,
at least, freedom, here, is not to be regarded as action upon
preference; it is more like such a leap of the nature as moves men
to the instinctive desire of sexual union, or, in the case 
of some, to
fine conduct; the motive lies elsewhere than in the reason: like is
destined unfailingly to like, and each moves hither or thither at
its fixed moment.

<P>Even the Intellectual-Principle, which is before all the kosmos,
has, it also, its destiny, that of abiding intact above, and 
of giving
downwards: what it sends down is the particular whose existence is
implied in the law of the universal; for the universal broods
closely over the particular; it is not from without that the law
derives the power by which it is executed; on the contrary the law
is given in the entities upon whom it falls; these bear it about
with them. Let but the moment arrive, and what it decrees will be
brought to act by those beings in whom it resides; they fulfil it
because they contain it; it prevails because it is within them; it
becomes like a heavy burden, and sets up in them a painful longing
to enter the realm to which they are bidden from within.
