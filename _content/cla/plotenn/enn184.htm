<P>9. We admit, then, a Necessity in all that is brought about by
this compromise between evil and accidental circumstance: what room
was there for anything else than the thing that is? Given all the
causes, all must happen beyond aye or nay- that is, all the external
and whatever may be due to the sidereal circuit- therefore when the
Soul has been modified by outer forces and acts under that 
pressure so
that what it does is no more than an unreflecting acceptance of
stimulus, neither the act nor the state can be described as 
voluntary:
so, too, when even from within itself, it falls at times below its
best and ignores the true, the highest, laws of action.

<P>But when our Soul holds to its Reason-Principle, to the guide,
pure and detached and native to itself, only then can we speak of
personal operation, of voluntary act. Things so done may truly be
described as our doing, for they have no other source; they are the
issue of the unmingled Soul, a Principle that is a First, a leader,
a sovereign not subject to the errors of ignorance, not to be
overthrown by the tyranny of the desires which, where they can break
in, drive and drag, so as to allow of no act of ours, but mere
answer to stimulus.
