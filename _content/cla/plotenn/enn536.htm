<P>30. With regard to States:

<P>It may seem strange that States should be set up as a 
third class-
or whatever class it is- since all States are referable to Matter.
We shall be told that there is a difference among States, and that a
State as in Matter has definite characteristics 
distinguishing it from
all other States and further that, whereas Qualities are States of
Matter, States properly so-called belong to Qualities. But if
Qualities are nothing but States of Matter, States [in the strict
sense of the term] are ultimately reducible to Matter, and under
Matter they must be classed.

<P>Further, how can States constitute a single genus, when there is
such manifold diversity among them? How can we group together three
yards long" and "white"- Quantity and Quality respectively? Or again
Time and Place? How can "yesterday," "last year," "in the 
Lyceum," "in
the Academy," be States at all? How can Time be in any sense a
State? Neither is Time a State nor the events in Time, neither the
objects in Space nor Space itself.

<P>And how can Action be a State? One acting is not in a state of
being but in a state of Action, or rather in Action simply: no state
is involved. Similarly, what is predicated of the patient is not a
state of being but a state of Passion, or strictly, Passion
unqualified by state.

<P>But it would seem that State was the right category at least for
cases of Situation and Possession: yet Possession does not imply
possession of some particular state, but is Possession absolute.

<P>As for the Relative State, if the theory does not include it in
the same genus as the other States, another question arises: we must
enquire whether any actuality is attributed to this 
particular type of
relation, for to many types actuality is denied.

<P>It is, moreover, absurd that an entity which depends upon the
prior existence of other entities should be classed in the same
genus with those priors: one and two must, clearly, exist, 
before half
and double can.

<P>The various speculations on the subject of the Existents and the
principles of the Existents, whether they have entailed an 
infinite or
a finite number, bodily or bodiless, or even supposed the 
Composite to
be the Authentic Existent, may well be considered separately with
the help of the criticisms made by the ancients upon them.
