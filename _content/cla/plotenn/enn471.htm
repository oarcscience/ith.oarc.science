<P>5. And again: the multiple must be always seeking its identity,
desiring self-accord and self-awareness: but what scope is there
within what is an absolute unity in which to move towards 
its identity
or at what term may it hope for self-knowing? It holds its 
identity in
its very essence and is above consciousness and all intellective
act. Intellection is not a primal either in the fact of being or in
the value of being; it is secondary and derived: for there exists
The Good; and this moves towards itself while its sequent is 
moved and
by that movement has its characteristic vision. The intellective act
may be defined as a movement towards The Good in some being that
aspires towards it; the effort produces the fact; the two are
coincident; to see is to have desired to see: hence again the
Authentic Good has no need of intellection since itself and nothing
else is its good.

<P>The intellective act is a movement towards the unmoved Good:
thus the self-intellection in all save the Absolute Good is the
working of the imaged Good within them: the intellectual principle
recognises the likeness, sees itself as a good to itself, an 
object of
attraction: it grasps at that manifestation of The Good and, in
holding that, holds self-vision: if the state of goodness is 
constant,
it remains constantly self-attractive and self-intellective. The
self-intellection is not deliberate: it sees itself as an incident
in its contemplation of The Good; for it sees itself in virtue of
its Act; and, in all that exists, the Act is towards The Good.
