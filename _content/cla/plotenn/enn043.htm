<P>11. We shall perhaps be told that in such a state the man is no
longer alive: we answer that these people show themselves equally
unable to understand his inner life and his happiness.

<P>If this does not satisfy them, we must ask them to keep in mind
a living Sage and, under these terms, to enquire whether the 
man is in
happiness: they must not whittle away his life and then ask 
whether he
has the happy life; they must not take away man and then look for
the happiness of a man: once they allow that the Sage lives within,
they must not seek him among the outer activities, still less look
to the outer world for the object of his desires. To consider the
outer world to be a field to his desire, to fancy the Sage desiring
any good external, would be to deny Substantial-Existence to
happiness; for the Sage would like to see all men prosperous and no
evil befalling anyone; but though it prove otherwise, he is still
content.

<P>If it be admitted that such a desire would be against reason,
since evil cannot cease to be, there is no escape from agreeing with
us that the Sage's will is set always and only inward.
