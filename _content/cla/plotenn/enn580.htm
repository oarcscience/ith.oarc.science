<P>20. We have to ascertain whether there is not to every quality a
contrary. In the case of virtue and vice, even the mean appears to
be contrary to the extremes.

<P>But when we turn to colours, we do not find the intermediates so
related. If we regard the intermediates as blendings of the
extremes, we must not posit any contrariety other than that between
black and white, but must show that all other colours are 
combinations
of these two. Contrariety however demands that there be some one
distinct quality in the intermediates, though this quality 
may be seen
to arise from a combination.

<P>It may further be suggested that contraries not only differ from
each other, but also entail the greatest possible 
difference. But "the
greatest possible difference" would seem to presuppose that
intermediates have already been established: eliminate the 
series, and
how will you define "the greatest possible"? Sight, we may be told,
will reveal to us that grey is nearer than black to white; and taste
may be our judge when we have hot, cold and no intermediate.

<P>That we are accustomed to act upon these assumptions is obvious
enough; but the following considerations may perhaps commend
themselves:

<P>White and yellow are entirely different from each other- a
statement which applies to any colour whatsoever as compared with
any other; they are accordingly contrary qualities. Their
contrariety is independent of the presence of intermediates: between
health and disease no intermediate intrudes, and yet they are
contraries.

<P>It may be urged that the products of a contrariety exhibit the
greatest diversity. But "the greatest diversity" is clearly
meaningless, unless we can point to lower degrees of diversity in
the means. Thus, we cannot speak of "the greatest diversity" in
reference to health and disease. This definition of contrariety is
therefore inadmissible.

<P>Suppose that we say "great diversity" instead of "the greatest":
if "great" is equivalent to greater and implies a less, immediate
contraries will again escape us; if, on the other hand, we mean
strictly "great" and assume that every quality shows a great
divergence from every other, we must not suppose that the divergence
can be measured by a comparative.

<P>Nonetheless, we must endeavour to find a meaning for the term
"contrary." Can we accept the principle that when things have a
certain similarity which is not generic nor in any sense due to
admixture, but a similarity residing in their forms- if the term be
permitted- they differ in degree but are not contraries; contraries
being rather those things which have no specific identity? 
It would be
necessary to stipulate that they belong to the same genus, 
Quality, in
order to cover those immediate contraries which [apparently] have
nothing conducing to similarity, inasmuch as there are no
intermediates looking both ways, as it were, and having a mutual
similarity to each other; some contraries are precluded by their
isolation from similarity.

<P>If these observations be sound, colours which have a 
common ground
will not be contraries. But there will be nothing to prevent, not
indeed every colour from being contrary to every other, but any one
colour from being contrary to any other; and similarly with tastes.
This will serve as a statement of the problem.

<P>As for Degree [subsisting in Quality], it was given as 
our opinion
that it exists in the objects participating in Quality, 
though whether
it enters into qualities as such- into health and justice- was left
open to question. If indeed these qualities possess an 
extension quite
apart from their participants, we must actually ascribe to them
degrees: but in truth they belong to a sphere where each 
entity is the
whole and does not admit of degree.
