<P>22. May we think that the mode of the soul's presence to body is
that of the presence of light to the air?

<P>This certainly is presence with distinction: the light
penetrates through and through, but nowhere coalesces; the light is
the stable thing, the air flows in and out; when the air 
passes beyond
the lit area it is dark; under the light it is lit: we have a true
parallel to what we have been saying of body and soul, for the air
is in the light quite as much as the light in the air.

<P>Plato therefore is wise when, in treating of the All, he puts
the body in its soul, and not its soul in the body, and says that,
while there is a region of that soul which contains body, there is
another region to which body does not enter- certain powers, that
is, with which body has no concern. And what is true of the All-Soul
is true of the others.

<P>There are, therefore, certain soul-powers whose presence to body
must be denied.

<P>The phases present are those which the nature of body demands:
they are present without being resident- either in any parts of the
body or in the body as a whole.

<P>For the purposes of sensation the sensitive phase of the soul is
present to the entire sensitive being: for the purposes of act,
differentiation begins; every soul phase operates at a point
peculiar to itself.
