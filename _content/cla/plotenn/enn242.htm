<P>11. I think, in fact, that Plato had this in mind where he
justly speaks of the Images of Real Existents "entering and passing
out": these particular words are not used idly: he wishes us to
grasp the precise nature of the relation between Matter and 
the Ideas.

<P>The difficulty on this point is not really that which presented
itself to most of our predecessors- how the Ideas enter into Matter-
it is rather the mode of their presence in it.

<P>It is in fact strange at sight that Matter should remain itself
intact, unaffected by Ideal-forms present within it, 
especially seeing
that these are affected by each other. It is surprising, 
too, that the
entrant Forms should regularly expel preceding shapes and qualities,
and that the modification [which cannot touch Matter] should affect
what is a compound [of Idea with Matter] and this, again, not a
haphazard but precisely where there is need of the incoming or
outgoing of some certain Ideal-form, the compound being deficient
through the absence of a particular principle whose presence will
complete it.

<P>But the reason is that the fundamental nature of Matter can take
no increase by anything entering it, and no decrease by any
withdrawal: what from the beginning it was, it remains. It 
is not like
those things whose lack is merely that of arrangement and order
which can be supplied without change of substance as when we dress
or decorate something bare or ugly.

<P>But where the bringing to order must cut through to the very
nature, the base original must be transmuted: it can leave ugliness
for beauty only by a change of substance. Matter, then, thus brought
to order must lose its own nature in the supreme degree unless its
baseness is an accidental: if it is base in the sense of being
Baseness the Absolute, it could never participate in order, and, if
evil in the sense of being Evil the Absolute, it could never
participate in good.

<P>We conclude that Matter's participation in Idea is not by way of
modification within itself: the process is very different; it is a
bare seeming. Perhaps we have here the solution of the difficulty as
to how Matter, essentially evil, can be reaching towards The Good:
there would be no such participation as would destroy its essential
nature. Given this mode of pseudo-participation- in which Matter
would, as we say, retain its nature, unchanged, always being what it
has essentially been- there is no longer any reason to wonder as to
how while essentially evil, it yet participates in Idea: for, by
this mode, it does not abandon its own character: 
participation is the
law, but it participates only just so far as its essence 
allows. Under
a mode of participation which allows it to remain on its own
footing, its essential nature stands none the less, whatsoever the
Idea, within that limit, may communicate to it: it is by no means
the less evil for remaining immutably in its own order. If it had
authentic participation in The Good and were veritably changed, it
would not be essentially evil.

<P>In a word, when we call Matter evil we are right only if we mean
that it is not amenable to modification by The Good; but that means
simply that it is subject to no modification whatever.
