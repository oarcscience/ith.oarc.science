<P>4. Now, in general anything that has a potentiality is actually
something else, and this potentiality of the future mode of being is
an existing mode.

<P>But what we think of as Matter, what we assert to be the
potentiality of all things, cannot be said to be actually any one
being among beings: if it were of itself any definite being, it
could not be potentially all.

<P>If, then, it is not among existences, it must necessarily be
without existence.

<P>How, therefore, can it be actually anything?

<P>The answer is that while Matter can not be any of the 
things which
are founded upon it, it may quite well be something else, admitting
that all existences are not rooted in Matter.

<P>But once more, if it is excluded from the entities 
founded upon it
and all these are Beings, it must itself be a Non-Being.

<P>It is, further, by definition, formless and therefore 
not an Idea:
it cannot then be classed among things of the Intellectual Realm,
and so is, once more, a Non-Being. Falling, as regards both worlds,
under Non-Being, it is all the more decidedly the Non-Being.

<P>It has eluded the Nature of the Authentic Existences; it has
even failed to come up with the things to which a spurious existence
can be attributed- for it is not even a phantasm of Reason as these
are- how is it possible to include it under any mode of Being?

<P>And if it falls under no mode of Being, what can it actually be?
