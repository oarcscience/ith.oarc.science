<P>1. The integral omnipresence of a unity numerically identical is
in fact universally received; for all men instinctively 
affirm the god
in each of us to be one, the same in all. It would be taken 
as certain
if no one asked How or sought to bring the conviction to the test of
reasoning; with this effective in their thought, men would 
be at rest,
finding their stay in that oneness and identity, so that 
nothing would
wrench them from this unity. This principle, indeed, is the most
solidly established of all, proclaimed by our very souls; we do not
piece it up item by item, but find it within beforehand; it precedes
even the principle by which we affirm unquestionably that all things
seek their good; for this universal quest of good depends on the
fact that all aim at unity and possess unity and that universally
effort is towards unity.

<P>Now this unity in going forth, so far as it may, towards 
the Other
Order must become manifest as multiplicity and in some sense become
multiple; but the primal nature and the appetition of the good,
which is appetition of unity, lead back to what is authentically
one; to this every form of Being is urged in a movement towards its
own reality. For the good to every nature possessing unity is to be
self-belonging, to be itself, and that means to be a unity.

<P>In virtue of that unity the Good may be regarded as truly
inherent. Hence the Good is not to be sought outside; it could not
have fallen outside of what is; it cannot possibly be found in
non-Being; within Being the Good must lie, since it is never a
non-Being.

<P>If that Good has Being and is within the realm of Being, then it
is present, self-contained, in everything: we, therefore, need not
look outside of Being; we are in it; yet that Good is not
exclusively ours: therefore all beings are one.
