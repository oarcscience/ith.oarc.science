<P>11. In childhood the main activity is in the Couplement and
there is but little irradiation from the higher principles of our
being: but when these higher principles act but feebly or rarely
upon us their action is directed towards the Supreme; they work upon
us only when they stand at the mid-point.

<P>But does not the include that phase of our being which stands
above the mid-point?

<P>It does, but on condition that we lay hold of it: our entire
nature is not ours at all times but only as we direct the mid-point
upwards or downwards, or lead some particular phase of our 
nature from
potentiality or native character into act.

<P>And the animals, in what way or degree do they possess the
Animate?

<P>If there be in them, as the opinion goes, human Souls that have
sinned, then the Animating-Principle in its separable phase does not
enter directly into the brute; it is there but not there to 
them; they
are aware only of the image of the Soul [only of the lower Soul] and
of that only by being aware of the body organised and determined by
that image.

<P>If there be no human Soul in them, the Animate is constituted
for them by a radiation from the All-Soul.
