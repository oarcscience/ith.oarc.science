<P>9. Everything brought into being under some principle not itself
is contained either within its maker or, if there is any 
intermediate,
within that: having a prior essential to its being, it needs that
prior always, otherwise it would not be contained at all. It is the
order of nature: The last in the immediately preceding lasts, things
of the order of the Firsts within their prior-firsts, and so thing
within thing up to the very pinnacle of source.

<P>That Source, having no prior, cannot be contained: uncontained
by any of those other forms of being, each held within the series of
priors, it is orbed round all, but so as not to be pointed 
off to hold
them part for part; it possesses but is not possessed. Holding all-
though itself nowhere held- it is omnipresent, for where its
presence failed something would elude its hold. At the same time, in
the sense that it is nowhere held, it is not present: thus it is
both present and not present; not present as not being circumscribed
by anything; yet, as being utterly unattached, not inhibited from
presence at any point. That inhibition would mean that the First was
determined by some other being; the later series, then, would be
without part in the Supreme; God has His limit and is no longer
self-governed but mastered by inferiors.

<P>While the contained must be where its container is, what is
uncontained by place is not debarred from any: for, imagine a place
where it is not and evidently some other place retains it; at once
it is contained and there is an end of its placelessness.

<P>But if the "nowhere" is to stand and the ascription of a
"where," implying station in the extern, is to fall, then nothing
can be left void; and at once- nothing void, yet no point
containing- God is sovereignly present through all. We 
cannot think of
something of God here and something else there, nor of all God
gathered at some one spot: there is an instantaneous presence
everywhere, nothing containing and nothing left void, everything
therefore fully held by the divine.

<P>Consider our universe. There is none before it and 
therefore it is
not, itself, in a universe or in any place- what place was there
before the universe came to be?- its linked members form and occupy
the whole. But Soul is not in the universe, on the contrary the
universe is in the Soul; bodily substance is not a place to the
Soul; Soul is contained in Intellectual-Principle and is the 
container
of body. The Intellectual-Principle in turn is contained in
something else; but that prior principle has nothing in which to be:
the First is therefore in nothing, and, therefore, nowhere. But all
the rest must be somewhere; and where but in the First?

<P>This can mean only that the First is neither remote from things
nor directly within them; there is nothing containing it; it
contains all. It is The Good to the universe if only in this 
way, that
towards it all things have their being, all dependent upon 
it, each in
its mode, so that thing rises above thing in goodness 
according to its
fuller possession of authentic being.
