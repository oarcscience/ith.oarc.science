<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 13</H4>

<P>13. And the principle that reasons out these matters? Is it We
or the Soul?

<P>We, but by the Soul.

<P>But how "by the Soul"? Does this mean that the Soul reasons by
possession [by contact with the matters of enquiry]?

<P>No; by the fact of being Soul. Its Act subsists without
movement; or any movement that can be ascribed to it must be utterly
distinct from all corporal movement and be simply the Soul's 
own life.

<P>And Intellection in us is twofold: since the Soul is 
intellective,
and Intellection is the highest phase of life, we have Intellection
both by the characteristic Act of our Soul and by the Act of the
Intellectual-Principle upon us- for this Intellectual-Principle is
part of us no less than the Soul, and towards it we are ever rising.
