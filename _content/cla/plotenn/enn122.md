#### Section 1

1\. By common agreement of all that have arrived at the conception of
such a Kind, what is known as Matter is understood to be a certain base,
a recipient of Form-Ideas. Thus far all go the same way. But departure
begins with the attempt to establish what this basic Kind is in itself,
and how it is a recipient and of what.

To a certain school, body-forms exclusively are the Real Beings;
existence is limited to bodies; there is one only Matter, the stuff
underlying the primal-constituents of the Universe: existence is nothing
but this Matter: everything is some modification of this; the elements
of the Universe are simply this Matter in a certain condition.

The school has even the audacity to foist Matter upon the divine beings
so that, finally, God himself becomes a mode of Matter- and this though
they make it corporeal, describing it as a body void of quality, but a
magnitude.

Another school makes it incorporeal: among these, not all hold the
theory of one only Matter; some of them while they maintain the one
Matter, in which the first school believes, the foundation of bodily
forms, admit another, a prior, existing in the divine-sphere, the base
of the Ideas there and of the unembodied Beings.
