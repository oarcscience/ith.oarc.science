<P>13. Of phenomena of this sphere some derive from the Kosmic
Circuit and some not: we must take them singly and mark them off,
assigning to each its origin.

<P>The gist of the whole matter lies in the consideration that Soul
governs this All by the plan contained in the Reason-Principle and
plays in the All exactly the part of the particular 
principle which in
every living-thing forms the members of the organism and adjusts
them to the unity of which they are portions; the entire force of
the Soul is represented in the All, but, in the parts, Soul 
is present
only in proportion to the degree of essential reality held by each
of such partial objects. Surrounding every separate entity there are
other entities, whose approach will sometimes be hostile and 
sometimes
helpful to the purpose of its nature; but to the All taken in its
length and breadth each and every separate existent is an adjusted
part, holding its own characteristic and yet contributing by its own
native tendency to the entire life-history of the Universe.

<P>The soulless parts of the All are merely instruments; all their
action is effected, so to speak, under a compulsion from outside
themselves.

<P>The ensouled fall into two classes. The one kind has a motion of
its own, but haphazard like that of horses between the shafts but
before their driver sets the course; they are set right by the whip.
In the Living-Being possessed of Reason, the 
nature-principle includes
the driver; where the driver is intelligent, it takes in the main a
straight path to a set end. But both classes are members of the All
and co-operate towards the general purpose.

<P>The greater and most valuable among them have an important
operation over a wide range: their contribution towards the life of
the whole consists in acting, not in being acted upon; others, but
feebly equipped for action, are almost wholly passive; there is an
intermediate order whose members contain within themselves a 
principle
of productivity and activity and make themselves very effective in
many spheres or ways and yet serve also by their passivity.

<P>Thus the All stands as one all-complete Life, whose members, to
the measure in which each contains within itself the Highest, effect
all that is high and noble: and the entire scheme must be
subordinate to its Dirigeant as an army to its general, "following
upon Zeus"- it has been said- "as he proceeds towards the 
Intelligible
Kind."

<P>Secondary in the All are those of its parts which possess a less
exalted nature just as in us the members rank lower than the 
Soul; and
so all through, there is a general analogy between the things of the
All and our own members- none of quite equal rank.

<P>All living things, then- all in the heavens and all elsewhere-
fall under the general Reason-Principle of the All- they have been
made parts with a view to the whole: not one of these parts, however
exalted, has power to effect any alteration of these 
Reason-Principles
or of things shaped by them and to them; some modification one part
may work upon another, whether for better or for worse; but there is
no power that can wrest anything outside of its distinct nature.

<P>The part effecting such a modification for the worse may act in
several ways.

<P>It may set up some weakness restricted to the material frame. Or
it may carry the weakness through to the sympathetic Soul 
which by the
medium of the material frame, become a power to debasement, has been
delivered over, though never in its essence, to the inferior order
of being. Or, in the case of a material frame ill-organized, it may
check all such action [of the Soul] upon the material frame 
as demands
a certain collaboration in the part acted upon: thus a lyre may be
so ill-strung as to be incapable of the melodic exactitude necessary
to musical effect.
