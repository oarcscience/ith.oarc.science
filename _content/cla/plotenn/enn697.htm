<P>16. We maintain, and it is evident truth, that the Supreme is
everywhere and yet nowhere; keeping this constantly in mind 
let us see
how it bears on our present enquiry.

<P>If God is nowhere, then not anywhere has He "happened to be"; as
also everywhere, He is everywhere in entirety: at once, He is that
everywhere and everywise: He is not in the everywhere but is the
everywhere as well as the giver to the rest of things of their being
in that everywhere. Holding the supreme place- or rather no 
holder but
Himself the Supreme- all lies subject to Him; they have not brought
Him to be but happen, all, to Him- or rather they stand there before
Him looking upon Him, not He upon them. He is borne, so to speak, to
the inmost of Himself in love of that pure radiance which He is, He
Himself being that which He. loves. That is to say, as self-dwelling
Act and Intellectual-Principle, the most to be loved, He has given
Himself existence. Intellectual-Principle is the issue of Act: God
therefore is issue of Act, but, since no other has generated Him, He
is what He made Himself: He is not, therefore, "as He happened to
be" but as He acted Himself into being.

<P>Again; if He preeminently is because He holds firmly, so 
to speak,
towards Himself, looking towards Himself, so that what we must call
his being is this self-looking, He must again, since the word is
inevitable, make Himself: thus, not "as He happens to be" is 
He but as
He Himself wills to be. Nor is this will a hazard, a something
happening; the will adopting the Best is not a thing of chance.

<P>That his being is constituted by this self-originating
self-tendence- at once Act and repose- becomes clear if we 
imagine the
contrary; inclining towards something outside of Himself, He would
destroy the identity of his being. This self-directed Act is,
therefore, his peculiar being, one with Himself. If, then, his act
never came to be but is eternal- a waking without an awakener, an
eternal wakening and a supra-Intellection- He is as He waked Himself
to be. This awakening is before being, before
Intellectual-Principle, before rational life, though He is these; He
is thus an Act before Intellectual-Principle and consciousness and
life; these come from Him and no other; his being, then, is a
self-presence, issuing from Himself. Thus not "as He happened to be"
is He but as He willed to be.
