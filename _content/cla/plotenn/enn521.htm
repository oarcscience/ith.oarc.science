<P>15. The "category of Action":

<P>The quantum has been regarded as a single genus on the 
ground that
Quantity and Number are attributes of Substance and posterior to it;
the quale has been regarded as another genus because Quality is an
attribute of Substance: on the same principle it is maintained that
since activity is an attribute of Substance, Action constitutes yet
another genus.

<P>Does then the action constitute the genus, or the activity from
which the action springs, in the same way as Quality is the 
genus from
which the quale is derived? Perhaps activity, action and agent
should all be embraced under a single head? But, on the one hand,
the action- unlike activity- tends to comport the agent; and on the
other, it signifies being in some activity and therefore
Being-in-Act [actual as distinct from potential Being]. Consequently
the category will be one of Act rather than of Action.

<P>Act moreover incontestably manifests itself in Substance, as was
found to be the case with Quality: it is connected with Substance as
being a form of motion. But Motion is a distinct genus: for, seeing
that Quality is a distinct attribute of Substance, and Quality a
distinct attribute, and Relative takes its being from the relation
of one substance to another, there can be no reason why Motion, also
an attribute of Substance, should not also constitute a distinct
genus.
