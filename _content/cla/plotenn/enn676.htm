<P>38. And yet this "He Is" does not truly apply: the Supreme has
no need of Being: even "He is good" does not apply since it
indicates Being: the "is" should not suggest something predicated of
another thing; it is to state identity. The word "good" used 
of him is
not a predicate asserting his possession of goodness; it conveys an
identification. It is not that we think it exact to call him either
good or The Good: it is that sheer negation does not indicate; we
use the term The Good to assert identity without the affirmation of
Being.

<P>But how admit a Principle void of self-knowledge,
self-awareness; surely the First must be able to say "I possess
Being?"

<P>But he does not possess Being.

<P>Then, at least he must say "I am good?"

<P>No: once more, that would be an affirmation of Being.

<P>But surely he may affirm merely the goodness, adding nothing:
the goodness would be taken without the being and all 
duality avoided?

<P>No: such self-awareness as good must inevitably carry the
affirmation "I am the Good"; otherwise there would be merely the
unattached conception of goodness with no recognition of 
identity; any
such intellection would inevitably include the affirmation "I am."

<P>If that intellection were the Good, then the intellection would
not be self-intellection but intellection of the Good; not 
the Supreme
but that intellection would be the Good: if on the contrary that
intellection of the Good is distinct from the Good, at once the Good
exists before its knowing; all-sufficiently good in itself, it needs
none of that knowing of its own nature.

<P>Thus the Supreme does not know itself as Good.

<P>As what then?

<P>No such foreign matter is present to it: it can have only an
immediate intuition self-directed.
