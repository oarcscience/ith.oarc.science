<P>7. To Real Being we go back, all that we have and are; to that
we return as from that we came. Of what is There we have direct
knowledge, not images or even impressions; and to know without image
is to be; by our part in true knowledge we are those Beings; 
we do not
need to bring them down into ourselves, for we are There among them.
Since not only ourselves but all other things also are those Beings,
we all are they; we are they while we are also one with all: 
therefore
we and all things are one.

<P>When we look outside of that on which we depend we ignore our
unity; looking outward we see many faces; look inward and all is the
one head. If man could but be turned about by his own motion 
or by the
happy pull of Athene- he would see at once God and himself and the
All. At first no doubt all will not be seen as one whole, but when
we find no stop at which to declare a limit to our being we cease to
rule ourselves out from the total of reality; we reach to 
the All as a
unity- and this not by any stepping forward, but by the fact of
being and abiding there where the All has its being.
