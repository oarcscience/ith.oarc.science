<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 8</H4>

<P>8. C. (11) We come to the theory that this pneuma is an earlier
form, one which on entering the cold and being tempered by 
it develops
into soul by growing finer under that new condition. This is 
absurd at
the start, since many living beings rise in warmth and have a soul
that has been tempered by cold: still that is the theory- 
the soul has
an earlier form, and develops its true nature by force of external
accidents. Thus these teachers make the inferior precede the higher,
and before that inferior they put something still lower, their
"Habitude." It is obvious that the Intellectual-Principle is last
and has sprung from the soul, for, if it were first of all, the
order of the series must be, second the soul, then the
nature-principle, and always the later inferior, as the system
actually stands.

<P>If they treat God as they do the Intellectual-Principle- 
as later,
engendered and deriving intellection from without- soul and
intellect and God may prove to have no existence: this would 
follow if
a potentiality could not come to existence, or does not 
become actual,
unless the corresponding actuality exists. And what could lead it
onward if there were no separate being in previous actuality? Even
on the absurd supposition that the potentially existent brings
itself to actuality, it must be looking to some Term, and 
that must be
no potentiality but actual.

<P>No doubt the eternally self-identical may have 
potentiality and be
self-led to self-realization, but even in this case the being
considered as actualized is of higher order than the being
considered as merely capable of actualization and moving towards a
desired Term.

<P>Thus the higher is the earlier, and it has a nature other than
body, and it exists always in actuality: Intellectual-Principle and
Soul precede Nature: thus, Soul does not stand at the level of
pneuma or of body.

<P>These arguments are sufficient in themselves, though many others
have been framed, to show that the soul is not to be thought of as a
body.
