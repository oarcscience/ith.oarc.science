<P>8. But it is not, in our view, as an attribute that this freedom
is present in the First. In the light of free acts, from which we
eliminate the contraries, we recognise There self-determination,
self-directed and, failing more suitable terms, we apply to it the
lesser terms brought over from lesser things and so tell it 
as best we
may: no words could ever be adequate or even applicable to that from
which all else- the noble, the august- is derived. For This is
principle of all, or, more strictly, unrelated to all and, in this
consideration, cannot be made to possess such laters as even freedom
and self-disposal, which in fact indicate manifestation upon the
extern- unhindered but implying the existence of other beings whose
opposition proves ineffective.

<P>We cannot think of the First as moving towards any 
other; He holds
his own manner of being before any other was; even Being we withhold
and therefore all relation to beings.

<P>Nor may we speak of any "conforming to the nature"; this again
is of the later; if the term be applicable at all in that realm it
applies only to the secondaries- primally to Essential Existence as
next to this First. And if a "nature" belongs only to things of
time, this conformity to nature does not apply even to Essential
Existence. On the other hand, we are not to deny that it is derived
from Essential Existence for that would be to take away its
existence and would imply derivation from something else.

<P>Does this mean that the First is to be described as happening to
be?

<P>No; that would be just as false; nothing "happens" to the First;
it stands in no such relationship; happening belongs only to the
multiple where, first, existence is given and then something 
is added.
And how could the Source "happen to be"? There has been no coming so
that you can put it to the question "How does this come to be? What
chance brought it here, gave it being?" Chance did not yet exist;
there was no "automatic action": these imply something before
themselves and occur in the realm of process.
