<P>7. But why does the existence of the Principle of Good 
necessarily
comport the existence of a Principle of Evil? Is it because the All
necessarily comports the existence of Matter? Yes: for necessarily
this All is made up of contraries: it could not exist if Matter did
not. The Nature of this Kosmos is, therefore, a blend; it is blended
from the Intellectual-Principle and Necessity: what comes 
into it from
God is good; evil is from the Ancient Kind which, we read, is the
underlying Matter not yet brought to order by the Ideal-Form.

<P>But, since the expression "this place" must be taken to mean the
All, how explain the words "mortal nature"?

<P>The answer is in the passage [in which the Father of Gods
addresses the Divinities of the lower sphere], "Since you 
possess only
a derivative being, you are not immortals... but by my power 
you shall
escape dissolution."

<P>The escape, we read, is not a matter of place, but of acquiring
virtue, of disengaging the self from the body; this is the 
escape from
Matter. Plato explains somewhere how a man frees himself and how he
remains bound; and the phrase "to live among the gods" means to live
among the Intelligible-Existents, for these are the Immortals.

<P>There is another consideration establishing the necessary
existence of Evil.

<P>Given that The Good is not the only existent thing, it is
inevitable that, by the outgoing from it or, if the phrase be
preferred, the continuous down-going or away-going from it, there
should be produced a Last, something after which nothing more can be
produced: this will be Evil.

<P>As necessarily as there is Something after the First, so
necessarily there is a Last: this Last is Matter, the thing which
has no residue of good in it: here is the necessity of Evil.
