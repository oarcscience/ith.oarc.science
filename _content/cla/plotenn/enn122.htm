<P>1. By common agreement of all that have arrived at the
conception of such a Kind, what is known as Matter is 
understood to be
a certain base, a recipient of Form-Ideas. Thus far all go the same
way. But departure begins with the attempt to establish what this
basic Kind is in itself, and how it is a recipient and of what.

<P>To a certain school, body-forms exclusively are the Real Beings;
existence is limited to bodies; there is one only Matter, the stuff
underlying the primal-constituents of the Universe: existence is
nothing but this Matter: everything is some modification of this;
the elements of the Universe are simply this Matter in a certain
condition.

<P>The school has even the audacity to foist Matter upon the divine
beings so that, finally, God himself becomes a mode of Matter- and
this though they make it corporeal, describing it as a body void of
quality, but a magnitude.

<P>Another school makes it incorporeal: among these, not 
all hold the
theory of one only Matter; some of them while they maintain the one
Matter, in which the first school believes, the foundation of bodily
forms, admit another, a prior, existing in the 
divine-sphere, the base
of the Ideas there and of the unembodied Beings.
