<P>1. We hold that the ordered universe, in its material mass, has
existed for ever and will for ever endure: but simply to refer this
perdurance to the Will of God, however true an explanation, 
is utterly
inadequate.

<P>The elements of this sphere change; the living beings of earth
pass away; only the Ideal-form [the species] persists: possibly a
similar process obtains in the All.

<P>The Will of God is able to cope with the ceaseless flux 
and escape
of body stuff by ceaselessly reintroducing the known forms in new
substances, thus ensuring perpetuity not to the particular 
item but to
the unity of idea: now, seeing that objects of this realm possess no
more than duration of form, why should celestial objects, and the
celestial system itself, be distinguished by duration of the
particular entity?

<P>Let us suppose this persistence to be the result of the
all-inclusiveness of the celestial and universal- with its
consequence, the absence of any outlying matter into which change
could take place or which could break in and destroy.

<P>This explanation would, no doubt, safeguard the integrity of the
Whole, of the All; but our sun and the individual being of the other
heavenly bodies would not on these terms be secured in perpetuity:
they are parts; no one of them is in itself the whole, the all; it
would still be probable that theirs is no more than that duration in
form which belongs to fire and such entities.

<P>This would apply even to the entire ordered universe itself. For
it is very possible that this too, though not in process of
destruction from outside, might have only formal duration; its parts
may be so wearing each other down as to keep it in a continuous
decay while, amid the ceaseless flux of the Kind constituting its
base, an outside power ceaselessly restores the form: in this way
the living All may lie under the same conditions as man and horse
and the rest man and horse persisting but not the individual of the
type.

<P>With this, we would have no longer the distinction of one order,
the heavenly system, stable for ever, and another, the earthly, in
process of decay: all would be alike except in the point of time;
the celestial would merely be longer lasting. If, then, we accepted
this duration of type alone as a true account of the All equally
with its partial members, our difficulties would be eased- or indeed
we should have no further problem- once the Will of God were shown
to be capable, under these conditions and by such communication, of
sustaining the Universe.

<P>But if we are obliged to allow individual persistence to any
definite entity within the Kosmos then, firstly, we must 
show that the
Divine Will is adequate to make it so; secondly, we have to face the
question, What accounts for some things having individual
persistence and others only the persistence of type? and, thirdly,
we ask how the partial entities of the celestial system hold a real
duration which would thus appear possible to all partial things.
