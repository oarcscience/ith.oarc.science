<P>6. We take it, then, that the Intellectual-Principle is the
authentic existences and contains them all- not as in a place but as
possessing itself and being one thing with this its content. All are
one there and yet are distinct: similarly the mind holds 
many branches
and items of knowledge simultaneously, yet none of them merged into
any other, each acting its own part at call quite 
independently, every
conception coming out from the inner total and working singly. It is
after this way, though in a closer unity, that the
Intellectual-Principle is all Being in one total- and yet not in
one, since each of these beings is a distinct power which, however,
the total Intellectual-Principle includes as the species in a genus,
as the parts in a whole. This relation may be illustrated by the
powers in seed; all lies undistinguished in the unit, the formative
ideas gathered as in one kernel; yet in that unit there is
eye-principle, and there is hand-principle, each of which is
revealed as a separate power by its distinct material product. Thus
each of the powers in the seed is a Reason-Principle one and
complete yet including all the parts over which it presides: there
will be something bodily, the liquid, for example, carrying mere
Matter; but the principle itself is Idea and nothing else, idea
identical with the generative idea belonging to the lower soul,
image of a higher. This power is sometimes designated as 
Nature in the
seed-life; its origin is in the divine; and, outgoing from its
priors as light from fire, it converts and shapes the matter of
things, not by push and pull and the lever work of which we hear so
much, but by bestowal of the Ideas.
