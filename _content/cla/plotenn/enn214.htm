<P>1. Some Existents [Absolute Unity and Intellectual-Principle]
remain at rest while their Hypostases, or Expressed-Idea, come into
being; but, in our view, the Soul generates by its motion, 
to which is
due the sensitive faculty- that in any of its 
expression-forms- Nature
and all forms of life down to the vegetable order. Even as it is
present in human beings the Soul carries its Expression-form
[Hypostasis] with it, but is not the dominant since it is not the
whole man (humanity including the Intellectual Principal, as 
well): in
the vegetable order it is the highest since there is nothing to
rival it; but at this phase it is no longer reproductive, or, at
least, what it produces is of quite another order; here life ceases;
all later production is lifeless.

<P>What does this imply?

<P>Everything the Soul engenders down to this point comes into
being shapeless, and takes form by orientation towards its author
and supporter: therefore the thing engendered on the further side
can be no image of the Soul, since it is not even alive; it 
must be an
utter Indetermination. No doubt even in things of the nearer order
there was indetermination, but within a form; they were undetermined
not utterly but only in contrast with their perfect state: at this
extreme point we have the utter lack of determination. Let it be
raised to its highest degree and it becomes body by taking such
shape as serves its scope; then it becomes the recipient of 
its author
and sustainer: this presence in body is the only example of the
boundaries of Higher Existents running into the boundary of 
the Lower.
