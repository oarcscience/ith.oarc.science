<P>13. But what is the difference between the Wisdom thus
conducting the universe and the principle known as Nature?

<P>This Wisdom is a first [within the All-Soul] while Nature is a
last: for Nature is an image of that Wisdom, and, as a last in the
soul, possesses only the last of the Reason-Principle: we may
imagine a thick waxen seal, in which the imprint has 
penetrated to the
very uttermost film so as to show on both sides, sharp cut on the
upper surface, faint on the under. Nature, thus, does not know, it
merely produces: what it holds it passes, automatically, to its
next; and this transmission to the corporeal and material
constitutes its making power: it acts as a thing warmed, 
communicating
to what lies in next contact to it the principle of which it is the
vehicle so as to make that also warm in some less degree.

<P>Nature, being thus a mere communicator, does not possess even
the imaging act. There is [within the Soul] intellection, superior
to imagination; and there is imagination standing midway between
that intellection and the impression of which alone Nature 
is capable.
For Nature has no perception or consciousness of anything; 
imagination
[the imaging faculty] has consciousness of the external, for it
enables that which entertains the image to have knowledge of the
experience encountered, while Nature's function is to engender- of
itself though in an act derived from the active principle [of the
soul].

<P>Thus the Intellectual-Principle possesses: the Soul of the All
eternally receives from it; this is the soul's life; its 
consciousness
is its intellection of what is thus eternally present to it; what
proceeds from it into Matter and is manifested there is Nature, with
which- or even a little before it- the series of real being comes to
an end, for all in this order are the ultimates of the intellectual
order and the beginnings of the imitative.

<P>There is also the decided difference that Nature operates toward
soul, and receives from it: soul, near to Nature but superior,
operates towards Nature but without receiving in turn; and there is
the still higher phase [the purely Intellectual] with no action
whatever upon body or upon Matter.
