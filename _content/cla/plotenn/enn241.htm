<P>10. Further: If Matter were susceptible of modification, it must
acquire something by the incoming of the new state; it will either
adopt that state, or, at least, it will be in some way different
from what it was. Now upon this first incoming quality suppose a
second to supervene; the recipient is no longer Matter but a
modification of Matter: this second quality, perhaps, departs, but
it has acted and therefore leaves something of itself after it; the
substratum is still further altered. This process proceeding, the
substratum ends by becoming something quite different from Matter;
it becomes a thing settled in many modes and many shapes; at once it
is debarred from being the all-recipient; it will have closed the
entry against many incomers. In other words, the Matter is no longer
there: Matter is destructible.

<P>No: if there is to be a Matter at all, it must be always
identically as it has been from the beginning: to speak of Matter as
changing is to speak of it as not being Matter.

<P>Another consideration: it is a general principle that a thing
changing must remain within its constitutive Idea so that the
alteration is only in the accidents and not in the essential thing;
the changing object must retain this fundamental permanence, and the
permanent substance cannot be the member of it which accepts
modification.

<P>Therefore there are only two possibilities: the first, 
that Matter
itself changes and so ceases to be itself, the second that it never
ceases to be itself and therefore never changes.

<P>We may be answered that it does not change in its character as
Matter: but no one could tell us in what other character it changes;
and we have the admission that the Matter in itself is not subject
to change.

<P>Just as the Ideal Principles stand immutably in their essence-
which consists precisely in their permanence- so, since the 
essence of
Matter consists in its being Matter [the substratum to all material
things] it must be permanent in this character; because it is
Matter, it is immutable. In the Intellectual realm we have the
immutable Idea; here we have Matter, itself similarly immutable.
