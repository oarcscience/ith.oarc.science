<P>3. What then must The Unity be, what nature is left for it?

<P>No wonder that to state it is not easy; even Being and Form are
not easy, though we have a way, an approach through the Ideas.

<P>The soul or mind reaching towards the formless finds itself
incompetent to grasp where nothing bounds it or to take impression
where the impinging reality is diffuse; in sheer dread of holding to
nothingness, it slips away. The state is painful; often it seeks
relief by retreating from all this vagueness to the region of sense,
there to rest as on solid ground, just as the sight distressed by
the minute rests with pleasure on the bold.

<P>Soul must see in its own way; this is by coalescence, 
unification;
but in seeking thus to know the Unity it is prevented by that very
unification from recognising that it has found; it cannot
distinguish itself from the object of this intuition. Nonetheless,
this is our one resource if our philosophy is to give us knowledge
of The Unity.

<P>We are in search of unity; we are to come to know the 
principle of
all, the Good and First; therefore we may not stand away from the
realm of Firsts and lie prostrate among the lasts: we must strike
for those Firsts, rising from things of sense which are the lasts.
Cleared of all evil in our intention towards The Good, we must
ascend to the Principle within ourselves; from many, we must become
one; only so do we attain to knowledge of that which is Principle
and Unity. We shape ourselves into Intellectual-Principle; we make
over our soul in trust to Intellectual-Principle and set it firmly
in That; thus what That sees the soul will waken to see; it 
is through
the Intellectual-Principle that we have this vision of The Unity; it
must be our care to bring over nothing whatever from sense, to allow
nothing even of soul to enter into Intellectual-Principle: with
Intellect pure, and with the summit of Intellect, we are to see the
All-Pure.

<P>If quester has the impression of extension or shape or mass
attaching to That Nature he has not been led by 
Intellectual-Principle
which is not of the order to see such things; the activity 
has been of
sense and of the judgement following upon sense: only
Intellectual-Principle can inform us of the things of its scope; its
competence is upon its priors, its content and its issue: 
but even its
content is outside of sense; and still purer, still less touched by
multiplicity, are its priors, or rather its Prior.

<P>The Unity, then, is not Intellectual-Principle but something
higher still: Intellectual-Principle is still a being but that First
is no being but precedent to all Being; it cannot be a being, for a
being has what we may call the shape of its reality but The Unity is
without shape, even shape Intellectual.

<P>Generative of all, The Unity is none of all; neither thing nor
quantity nor quality nor intellect nor soul; not in motion, not at
rest, not in place, not in time: it is the self-defined, unique in
form or, better, formless, existing before Form was, or Movement or
Rest, all of which are attachments of Being and make Being the
manifold it is.

<P>But how, if not in movement, can it be otherwise than at rest?

<P>The answer is that movement and rest are states pertaining to
Being, which necessarily has one or the other or both. Besides,
anything at rest must be so in virtue of Rest as something distinct:
Unity at rest becomes the ground of an attribute and at once 
ceases to
be a simplex.

<P>Note, similarly, that, when we speak of this First as Cause, we
are affirming something happening not to it but to us, the fact that
we take from this Self-Enclosed: strictly we should put 
neither a This
nor a That to it; we hover, as it were, about it, seeking the
statement of an experience of our own, sometimes nearing 
this Reality,
sometimes baffled by the enigma in which it dwells.
