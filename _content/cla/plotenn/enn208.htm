<P>3. For, even though the I is sovereign in choosing, yet by the
fact of the choice the thing done takes its place in the ordered
total. Your personality does not come from outside into the
universal scheme; you are a part of it, you and your personal
disposition.

<P>But what is the cause of this initial personality?

<P>This question resolves itself into two: are we to make the
Creator, if Creator there is, the cause of the moral quality of the
individual or does the responsibility lie with the creature?

<P>Or is there, perhaps, no responsibility? After all, none is
charged in the case of plants brought into being without the
perceptive faculties; no one is blamed because animals are not all
that men are- which would be like complaining that men are not all
that gods are. Reason acquits plant and animal and, their maker; how
can it complain because men do not stand above humanity?

<P>If the reproach simply means that Man might improve by bringing
from his own stock something towards his betterment we must 
allow that
the man failing in this is answerable for his own inferiority: but
if the betterment must come not from within the man but from
without, from his Author, it is folly to ask more than has 
been given,
as foolish in the case of man as in plant and animal.

<P>The question is not whether a thing is inferior to something
else but whether in its own Kind it suffices to its own part;
universal equality there cannot be.

<P>Then the Reason-Principle has measured things out with the set
purpose of inequality?

<P>Certainly not: the inequality is inevitable by the nature of
things: the Reason-Principle of this Universe follows upon a phase
of the Soul; the Soul itself follows upon an Intellectual Principle,
and this Intellectual Principle is not one among the things of the
Universe but is all things; in all things, there is implied 
variety of
things; where there is variety and not identity there must 
be primals,
secondaries, tertiaries and every grade downward. Forms of 
life, then,
there must be that are not pure Soul but the dwindling of Souls
enfeebled stage by stage of the process. There is, of course, a Soul
in the Reason-Principle constituting a living being, but it 
is another
Soul [a lesser phase], not that [the Supreme Soul] from which the
Reason-Principle itself derives; and this combined vehicle of life
weakens as it proceeds towards matter, and what it engenders is
still more deficient. Consider how far the engendered stands from
its origin and yet, what a marvel!

<P>In sum nothing can secure to a thing of process the 
quality of the
prior order, loftier than all that is product and amenable to no
charge in regard to it: the wonder is, only, that it reaches 
and gives
to the lower at all, and that the traces of its presence should be
so noble. And if its outgiving is greater than the lower can
appropriate, the debt is the heavier; all the blame must 
fall upon the
unreceptive creature, and Providence be the more exalted.
