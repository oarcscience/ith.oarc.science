<P>1. We have seen elsewhere that the Good, the Principle, is
simplex, and, correspondingly, primal- for the secondary can never
be simplex- that it contains nothing: that it is an integral Unity.

<P>Now the same Nature belongs to the Principle we know as The One.
just as the goodness of The Good is essential and not the 
outgrowth of
some prior substance so the Unity of The One is its essential.

<P>Therefore:

<P>When we speak of The One and when we speak of The Good we must
recognize an Identical Nature; we must affirm that they are the
same- not, it is true, as venturing any predication with regard to
that [unknowable] Hypostasis but simply as indicating it to ourselves
in the best terms we find.

<P>Even in calling it "The First" we mean no more than to express
that it is the most absolutely simplex: it is the Self-Sufficing
only in the sense that it is not of that compound nature which would
make it dependent upon any constituent; it is "the Self-Contained"
because everything contained in something alien must also exist by
that alien.

<P>Deriving, then, from nothing alien, entering into nothing alien,
in no way a made-up thing, there can be nothing above it.

<P>We need not, then, go seeking any other Principles; this- the
One and the Good- is our First; next to it follows the Intellectual
Principle, the Primal Thinker; and upon this follows Soul. 
Such is the
order in nature. The Intellectual Realm allows no more than these
and no fewer.

<P>Those who hold to fewer Principles must hold the identity of
either Intellectual-Principle and Soul or of Intellectual-Principle
and The First; but we have abundantly shown that these are distinct.

<P>It remains for us to consider whether there are more than these
Three.

<P>Now what other [Divine] Kinds could there be? No 
Principles of the
universe could be found at once simpler and more transcendent than
this whose existence we have affirmed and described.

<P>They will scarcely urge upon us the doubling of the Principle in
Act by a Principle in Potentiality. It is absurd to seek such a
plurality by distinguishing between potentiality and actuality in
the case of immaterial beings whose existence is in Act- 
even in lower
forms no such division can be made and we cannot conceive a 
duality in
the Intellectual-Principle, one phase in some vague calm, another
all astir. Under what form can we think of repose in the
Intellectual Principle as contrasted with its movement or utterance?
What would the quiescence of the one phase be as against the 
energy of
the others?

<P>No: the Intellectual-Principle is continuously itself,
unchangeably constituted in stable Act. With movement- towards it or
within it- we are in the realm of the Soul's operation: such act is
a Reason-Principle emanating from it and entering into Soul, 
thus made
an Intellectual Soul, but in no sense creating an intermediate
Principle to stand between the two.

<P>Nor are we warranted in affirming a plurality of Intellectual
Principles on the ground that there is one that knows and thinks and
another knowing that it knows and thinks. For whatever distinction
be possible in the Divine between its Intellectual Act and its
Consciousness of that Act, still all must be one projection not
unaware of its own operation: it would be absurd to imagine any such
unconsciousness in the Authentic Intelligence; the knowing principle
must be one and the selfsame with that which knows of the knowing.

<P>The contrary supposition would give us two beings, one 
that merely
knows, and another separate being that knows of the act of knowing.

<P>If we are answered that the distinction is merely a 
process of our
thought, then, at once, the theory of a plurality in the Divine
Hypostasis is abandoned: further, the question is opened whether our
thought can entertain a knowing principle so narrowed to its knowing
as not to know that it knows- a limitation which would be charged as
imbecility even in ourselves, who if but of very ordinary moral
force are always master of our emotions and mental processes.

<P>No: The Divine Mind in its mentation thinks itself; the object
of the thought is nothing external: Thinker and Thought are one;
therefore in its thinking and knowing it possesses itself, observes
itself and sees itself not as something unconscious but as 
knowing: in
this Primal Knowing it must include, as one and the same Act, the
knowledge of the knowing; and even the logical distinction mentioned
above cannot be made in the case of the Divine; the very eternity of
its self-thinking precludes any such separation between that
intellective act and the consciousness of the act.

<P>The absurdity becomes still more blatant if we introduce yet a
further distinction- after that which affirms the knowledge of the
knowing, a third distinction affirming the knowing of the 
knowledge of
the knowing: yet there is no reason against carrying on the division
for ever and ever.

<P>To increase the Primals by making the Supreme Mind engender the
Reason-Principle, and this again engender in the Soul a 
distinct power
to act as mediator between Soul and the Supreme Mind, this is to
deny intellection to the Soul, which would no longer derive 
its Reason
from the Intellectual-Principle but from an intermediate: the Soul
then would possess not the Reason-Principle but an image of it: the
Soul could not know the Intellectual-Principle; it could have no
intellection.
