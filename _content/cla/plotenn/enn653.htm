<P>15. That Life, the various, the all-including, the 
primal and one,
who can consider it without longing to be of it, disdaining all the
other?

<P>All other life is darkness, petty and dim and poor; it is
unclean and polluting the clean for if you do but look upon it you
no longer see nor live this life which includes all living, in which
there is nothing that does not live and live in a life of purity
void of all that is ill. For evil is here where life is in copy and
Intellect in copy; There is the archetype, that which is good in the
very Idea- we read- as holding The Good in the pure Idea. That
Archetype is good; Intellectual-Principle is good as holding its
life by contemplation of the archetype; and it sees also as good the
objects of its contemplation because it holds them in its act of
contemplating the Principle of Good. But these objects come to it
not as they are There but in accord with its own condition, for it
is their source; they spring thence to be here, and
Intellectual-Principle it is that has produced them by its vision
There. In the very law, never, looking to That, could it fail of
Intellectual Act; never, on the other hand, could it produce what is
There; of itself it could not produce; Thence it must draw its power
to bring forth, to teem with offspring of itself; from the Good it
takes what itself did not possess. From that Unity came multiplicity
to Intellectual-Principle; it could not sustain the power poured
upon it and therefore broke it up; it turned that one power into
variety so as to carry it piecemeal.

<P>All its production, effected in the power of The Good, contains
goodness; it is good, itself, since it is constituted by these
things of good; it is Good made diverse. It might be likened to a
living sphere teeming with variety, to a globe of faces radiant with
faces all living, to a unity of souls, all the pure souls, not
faulty but the perfect, with Intellect enthroned over all so that
the place entire glows with Intellectual splendour.

<P>But this would be to see it from without, one thing seeing
another; the true way is to become Intellectual-Principle and be,
our very selves, what we are to see.
