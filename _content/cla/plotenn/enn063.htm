<P>3. And the soul includes a faculty peculiarly addressed 
to Beauty-
one incomparably sure in the appreciation of its own, never in doubt
whenever any lovely thing presents itself for judgement.

<P>Or perhaps the soul itself acts immediately, affirming the
Beautiful where it finds something accordant with the Ideal-Form
within itself, using this Idea as a canon of accuracy in its 
decision.

<P>But what accordance is there between the material and that which
antedates all Matter?

<P>On what principle does the architect, when he finds the house
standing before him correspondent with his inner ideal of a house,
pronounce it beautiful? Is it not that the house before him, the
stones apart, is the inner idea stamped upon the mass of exterior
matter, the indivisible exhibited in diversity?

<P>So with the perceptive faculty: discerning in certain objects
the Ideal-Form which has bound and controlled shapeless matter,
opposed in nature to Idea, seeing further stamped upon the common
shapes some shape excellent above the common, it gathers into unity
what still remains fragmentary, catches it up and carries it within,
no longer a thing of parts, and presents it to the Ideal-Principle
as something concordant and congenial, a natural friend: the joy
here is like that of a good man who discerns in a youth the early
signs of a virtue consonant with the achieved perfection within his
own soul.

<P>The beauty of colour is also the outcome of a unification: it
derives from shape, from the conquest of the darkness inherent in
Matter by the pouring-in of light, the unembodied, which is a
Rational-Principle and an Ideal-Form.

<P>Hence it is that Fire itself is splendid beyond all material
bodies, holding the rank of Ideal-Principle to the other elements,
making ever upwards, the subtlest and sprightliest of all bodies, as
very near to the unembodied; itself alone admitting no other, all
the others penetrated by it: for they take warmth but this is never
cold; it has colour primally; they receive the Form of 
colour from it:
hence the splendour of its light, the splendour that belongs to the
Idea. And all that has resisted and is but uncertainly held by its
light remains outside of beauty, as not having absorbed the
plenitude of the Form of colour.

<P>And harmonies unheard in sound create the harmonies we hear, and
wake the soul to the consciousness of beauty, showing it the one
essence in another kind: for the measures of our sensible music are
not arbitrary but are determined by the Principle whose labour is to
dominate Matter and bring pattern into being.

<P>Thus far of the beauties of the realm of sense, images and
shadow-pictures, fugitives that have entered into Matter- to adorn,
and to ravish, where they are seen.
