<P>6. But how comes it that while the All-Soul has produced 
a kosmos,
the soul of the particular has not, though it is of the one 
ideal Kind
and contains, it too, all things in itself?

<P>We have indicated that a thing may enter and dwell at the same
time in various places; this ought to be explained, and the enquiry
would show how an identity resident simultaneously here and 
there may,
in its separate appearances, act or react- or both- after distinct
modes; but the matter deserves to be examined in a special 
discussion.

<P>To return, then: how and why has the All-Soul produced a kosmos,
while the particular souls simply administer some one part of it?

<P>In the first place, we are not surprised when men of identical
knowledge differ greatly in effective power.

<P>But the reason, we will be asked.

<P>The answer might be that there is an even greater 
difference among
these souls, the one never having fallen away from the All-Soul, but
dwelling within it and assuming body therein, while the others
received their allotted spheres when the body was already in
existence, when their sister soul was already in rule and, 
as it were,
had already prepared habitations for them. Again, the reason may be
that the one [the creative All-Soul] looks towards the universal
Intellectual-Principle [the exemplar of all that can be], while the
others are more occupied with the Intellectual within 
themselves, that
which is already of the sphere of part; perhaps, too, these 
also could
have created, but that they were anticipated by that originator- the
work accomplished before them- an impediment inevitable 
whichsoever of
the souls were first to operate.

<P>But it is safer to account for the creative act by nearer
connection with the over-world; the souls whose tendency is
exercised within the Supreme have the greater power; immune in that
pure seat they create securely; for the greater power takes the
least hurt from the material within which it operates; and this
power remains enduringly attached to the over-world: it creates,
therefore, self gathered and the created things gather round it; the
other souls, on the contrary, themselves go forth; that can mean
only that they have deserted towards the abyss; a main phase in them
is drawn downward and pulls them with it in the desire towards the
lower.

<P>The "secondary and tertiary souls," of which we hear, must be
understood in the sense of closer or remoter position: it is much as
in ourselves the relation to the Supreme is not identical 
from soul to
soul; some of us are capable of becoming Uniate, others of striving
and almost attaining, while a third rank is much less apt; it is a
matter of the degree or powers of the soul by which our expression
is determined- the first degree dominant in the one person, the
second, the third [the merely animal life] in others while, 
still, all
of us contain all the powers.
