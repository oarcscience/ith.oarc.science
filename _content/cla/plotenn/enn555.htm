<P>18. To pass to the consideration of beauty:

<P>If by beauty we mean the primary Beauty, the same or similar
arguments will apply here as to goodness: and if the beauty in the
Ideal-Form is, as it were, an effulgence [from that primary Beauty],
we may observe that it is not identical in all participants and that
an effulgence is necessarily a posterior.

<P>If we mean the beauty which identifies itself with 
Substance, this
has been covered in our treatment of Substance.

<P>If, again, we mean beauty in relation to ourselves as spectators
in whom it produces a certain experience, this Act [of production]
is Motion- and none the less Motion by being directed 
towards Absolute
Beauty.

<P>Knowledge again, is Motion originating in the self; it is the
observation of Being- an Act, not a State: hence it too falls under
Motion, or perhaps more suitably under Stability, or even under
both; if under both, knowledge must be thought of as a 
complex, and if
a complex, is posterior.

<P>Intelligence, since it connotes intelligent Being and comprises
the total of existence, cannot be one of the genera: the true
Intelligence [or Intellect] is Being taken with all its concomitants
[with the other four genera]; it is actually the sum of all the
Existents: Being on the contrary, stripped of its 
concomitants, may be
counted as a genus and held to an element in Intelligence.

<P>Justice and self-control [sophrosyne], and virtue in general-
these are all various Acts of Intelligence: they are consequently
not primary genera; they are posterior to a genus, that is to say,
they are species.
