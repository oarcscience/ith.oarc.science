<P>3. All this calls for examination; the enquiry must 
bring us close
to the solution as regards the gods.

<P>We have traced self-disposal to will, will to reasoning and,
next step, to right reasoning; perhaps to right reasoning we must
add knowledge, for however sound opinion and act may be they do not
yield true freedom when the adoption of the right course is 
the result
of hazard or of some presentment from the fancy with no knowledge of
the foundations of that rightness.

<P>Taking it that the presentment of fancy is not a matter of our
will and choice, how can we think those acting at its dictation to
be free agents? Fancy strictly, in our use, takes it rise from
conditions of the body; lack of food and drink sets up presentments,
and so does the meeting of these needs; similarly with seminal
abundance and other humours of the body. We refuse to range under
the principle of freedom those whose conduct is directed by such
fancy: the baser sort, therefore, mainly so guided, cannot 
be credited
with self-disposal or voluntary act. Self-disposal, to us, belongs
to those who, through the activities of the Intellectual-Principle,
live above the states of the body. The spring of freedom is the
activity of Intellectual-Principle, the highest in our being; the
proposals emanating thence are freedom; such desires as are formed
in the exercise of the Intellectual act cannot be classed as
involuntary; the gods, therefore, that live in this state, living by
Intellectual-Principle and by desire conformed to it, 
possess freedom.
