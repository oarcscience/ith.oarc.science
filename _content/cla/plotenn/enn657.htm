<P>19. Are we to rest all on pursuit and on the soul? Is it 
enough to
put faith in the soul's choice and call that good which the soul
pursues, never asking ourselves the motive of its choice? We marshal
demonstration as to the nature of everything else; is the good to be
dismissed as choice?

<P>Several absurdities would be entailed. The good becomes a mere
attribute of things; objects of pursuit are many and 
different so that
mere choice gives no assurance that the thing chosen is the best; in
fact, we cannot know the best until we know the good.

<P>Are we to determine the good by the respective values of things?

<P>This is to make Idea and Reason-Principle the test: all 
very well;
but arrived at these, what explanation have we to give as to why
Idea and Reason-Principle themselves are good? In the lower, we
recognise goodness- in its less perfect form- by comparison with
what is poorer still; we are without a standard There where no evil
exists, the Bests holding the field alone. Reason demands to 
know what
constitutes goodness; those principles are good in their own nature
and we are left in perplexity because cause and fact are identical:
and even though we should state a cause, the doubt still 
remains until
our reason claims its rights There. But we need not abandon the
search; another path may lead to the light.
