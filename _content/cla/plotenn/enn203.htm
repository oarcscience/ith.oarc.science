<P>17. The nature of the Reason-Principle is adequately expressed
in its Act and, therefore, the wider its extension the 
nearer will its
productions approach to full contrariety: hence the world of sense
is less a unity than is its Reason-Principle; it contains a wider
multiplicity and contrariety: its partial members will, therefore,
be urged by a closer intention towards fullness of life, a warmer
desire for unification.

<P>But desire often destroys the desired; it seeks its own 
good, and,
if the desired object is perishable, the ruin follows: and 
the partial
thing straining towards its completing principle draws towards
itself all it possibly can.

<P>Thus, with the good we have the bad: we have the opposed 
movements
of a dancer guided by one artistic plan; we recognize in his 
steps the
good as against the bad, and see that in the opposition lies 
the merit
of the design.

<P>But, thus, the wicked disappear?

<P>No: their wickedness remains; simply, their role is not of their
own planning.

<P>But, surely, this excuses them?

<P>No; excuse lies with the Reason-Principle- and the
Reason-Principle does not excuse them.

<P>No doubt all are members of this Principle but one is a good
man, another is bad- the larger class, this- and it goes as 
in a play;
the poet while he gives each actor a part is also using them as they
are in their own persons: he does not himself rank the men as
leading actor, second, third; he simply gives suitable words to
each, and by that assignment fixes each man's standing.

<P>Thus, every man has his place, a place that fits the good man, a
place that fits the bad: each within the two orders of them makes
his way, naturally, reasonably, to the place, good or bad, that
suits him, and takes the position he has made his own. There he
talks and acts, in blasphemy and crime or in all goodness: for the
actors bring to this play what they were before it was ever staged.

<P>In the dramas of human art, the poet provides the words but the
actors add their own quality, good or bad- for they have more to do
than merely repeat the author's words- in the truer drama which
dramatic genius imitates in its degree, the Soul displays itself in
a part assigned by the creator of the piece.

<P>As the actors of our stages get their masks and their costume,
robes of state or rags, so a Soul is allotted its fortunes, 
and not at
haphazard but always under a Reason: it adapts itself to the
fortunes assigned to it, attunes itself, ranges itself rightly to
the drama, to the whole Principle of the piece: then it 
speaks out its
business, exhibiting at the same time all that a Soul can express of
its own quality, as a singer in a song. A voice, a bearing,
naturally fine or vulgar, may increase the charm of a piece; on the
other hand, an actor with his ugly voice may make a sorry exhibition
of himself, yet the drama stands as good a work as ever: the
dramatist, taking the action which a sound criticism suggests,
disgraces one, taking his part from him, with perfect 
justice: another
man he promotes to more serious roles or to any more 
important play he
may have, while the first is cast for whatever minor work there may
be.

<P>Just so the Soul, entering this drama of the Universe, making
itself a part of the Play, bringing to its acting its personal
excellence or defect, set in a definite place at the entry and
accepting from the author its entire role- superimposed upon its own
character and conduct- just so, it receives in the end its
punishment and reward.

<P>But these actors, Souls, hold a peculiar dignity: they act in a
vaster place than any stage: the Author has made them masters of all
this world; they have a wide choice of place; they themselves
determine the honour or discredit in which they are agents 
since their
place and part are in keeping with their quality: they therefore fit
into the Reason-Principle of the Universe, each adjusted, most
legitimately, to the appropriate environment, as every string of the
lyre is set in the precisely right position, determined by the
Principle directing musical utterance, for the due production of the
tones within its capacity. All is just and good in the Universe in
which every actor is set in his own quite appropriate place, 
though it
be to utter in the Darkness and in Tartarus the dreadful sounds
whose utterance there is well.

<P>This Universe is good not when the individual is a 
stone, but when
everyone throws in his own voice towards a total harmony, singing
out a life- thin, harsh, imperfect, though it be. The Syrinx does
not utter merely one pure note; there is a thin obscure sound which
blends in to make the harmony of Syrinx music: the harmony is made
up from tones of various grades, all the tones differing, but the
resultant of all forming one sound.

<P>Similarly the Reason-Principle entire is One, but it is broken
into unequal parts: hence the difference of place found in the
Universe, better spots and worse; and hence the inequality of Souls,
finding their appropriate surroundings amid this local 
inequality. The
diverse places of this sphere, the Souls of unequal grade and unlike
conduct, are wen exemplified by the distinction of parts in 
the Syrinx
or any other instrument: there is local difference, but from every
position every string gives forth its own tone, the sound 
appropriate,
at once, to its particular place and to the entire plan.

<P>What is evil in the single Soul will stand a good thing in the
universal system; what in the unit offends nature will serve 
nature in
the total event- and still remains the weak and wrong tone it is,
though its sounding takes nothing from the worth of the whole, just
as, in another order of image, the executioner's ugly office does
not mar the well-governed state: such an officer is a civic 
necessity;
and the corresponding moral type is often serviceable; thus, even as
things are, all is well.
