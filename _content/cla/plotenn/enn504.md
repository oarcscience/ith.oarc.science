#### Section 13

13\. It remains to decide whether only what is known in sense exists
There or whether, on the contrary, as Absolute-Man differs from
individual man, so there is in the Supreme an Absolute-Soul differing
from Soul and an Absolute-Intellect differing from
Intellectual-Principle.

It must be stated at the outset that we cannot take all that is here to
be image of archetype, or Soul to be an image of Absolute-Soul: one
soul, doubtless, ranks higher than another, but here too, though perhaps
not as identified with this realm, is the Absolute-Soul.

Every soul, authentically a soul, has some form of rightness and moral
wisdom; in the souls within ourselves there is true knowing: and these
attributes are no images or copies from the Supreme, as in the
sense-world, but actually are those very originals in a mode peculiar to
this sphere. For those Beings are not set apart in some defined place;
wherever there is a soul that has risen from body, there too these are:
the world of sense is one- where, the Intellectual Kosmos is everywhere.
Whatever the freed soul attains to here, that it is There.

Thus, if by the content of the sense-world we mean simply the visible
objects, then the Supreme contains not only what is in the realm of
sense but more: if in the content of the kosmos we mean to include Soul
and the Soul-things, then all is here that is There.
