<P>2. Now the reasoning faculty which undertakes this problem is
not a unity but a thing of parts; it brings the bodily 
nature into the
enquiry, borrowing its principles from the corporeal: thus it thinks
of the Essential Existence as corporeal and as a thing of parts; it
baulks at the unity because it does not start from the appropriate
principles. We, however, must be careful to bring the appropriately
convincing principles to the discussion of the Unity, of perfect
Being: we must hold to the Intellectual principles which alone apply
to the Intellectual Order and to Real Being.

<P>On the one hand there is the unstable, exposed to all sorts of
change, distributed in place, not so much Being as Becoming: on the
other, there is that which exists eternally, not divided, subject to
no change of state, neither coming into being nor falling 
from it, set
in no region or place or support, emerging from nowhere, 
entering into
nothing, fast within itself.

<P>In dealing with that lower order we would reason from its own
nature and the characteristics it exhibits; thus, on a plausible
foundation, we achieve plausible results by a plausible system of
deduction: similarly, in dealing with the Intellectual, the only way
is to grasp the nature of the essence concerned and so lay the sure
foundations of the argument, not forgetfully straying over into that
other order but basing our treatment on what is essential to the
Nature with which we deal.

<P>In every entity the essential nature is the governing principle
and, as we are told, a sound definition brings to light many even of
the concomitants: where the essential nature is the entire being, we
must be all the more careful to keep to that, to look to that, to
refer all to that.
