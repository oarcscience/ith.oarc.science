<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 7</H4>

<P>7. And since the higher exists, there must be the lower as well.
The Universe is a thing of variety, and how could there be 
an inferior
without a superior or a superior without an inferior? We cannot
complain about the lower in the higher; rather, we must be 
grateful to
the higher for giving something of itself to the lower.

<P>In a word, those that would like evil driven out from the All
would drive out Providence itself.

<P>What would Providence have to provide for? Certainly not for
itself or for the Good: when we speak of a Providence above, we mean
an act upon something below.

<P>That which resumes all under a unity is a Principle in which all
things exist together and the single thing is All. From this
Principle, which remains internally unmoved, particular things push
forth as from a single root which never itself emerges. They are a
branching into part, into multiplicity, each single outgrowth
bearing its trace of the common source. Thus, phase by 
phase, there in
finally the production into this world; some things close 
still to the
root, others widely separate in the continuous progression until we
have, in our metaphor, bough and crest, foliage and fruit. At the
one side all is one point of unbroken rest, on the other is the
ceaseless process, leaf and fruit, all the things of process
carrying ever within themselves the Reason-Principles of the Upper
Sphere, and striving to become trees in their own minor order and
producing, if at all, only what is in strict gradation from
themselves.

<P>As for the abandoned spaces in what corresponds to the branches
these two draw upon the root, from which, despite all their
variance, they also derive; and the branches again operate upon
their own furthest extremities: operation is to be traced only from
point to next point, but, in the fact, there has been both inflow
and outgo [of creative or modifying force] at the very root which,
itself again, has its priors.

<P>The things that act upon each other are branchings from a
far-off beginning and so stand distinct; but they derive initially
from the one source: all interaction is like that of brothers,
resemblant as drawing life from the same parents.

<P></P>
