<P>11. But if these considerations are sound, why has Quality more
than one species? What is the ground for distinguishing between
habit and disposition, seeing that no differentia of Quality is
involved in permanence and non-permanence? A disposition of any kind
is sufficient to constitute a quality; permanence is a mere external
addition. It might however be urged that dispositions are but
incomplete "forms"- if the term may pass- habits being complete
ones. But incomplete, they are not qualities; if already qualities,
the permanence is an external addition.

<P>How do physical powers form a distinct species? If they are
classed as qualities in virtue of being powers, power, we have seen,
is not a necessary concomitant of qualities. If, however, we 
hold that
the natural boxer owes his quality to a particular disposition,
power is something added and does not contribute to the 
quality, since
power is found in habits also.

<P>Another point: why is natural ability to be distinguished from
that acquired by learning? Surely, if both are qualities, they
cannot be differentiae of Quality: gained by practice or given in
nature, it is the same ability; the differentia will be external to
Quality; it cannot be deduced from the Ideal Form of boxing. Whether
some qualities as distinguished from others are derived from
experience is immaterial; the source of the quality makes no
difference- none, I mean, pointing to variations and differences of
Quality.

<P>A further question would seem to be involved: If certain 
qualities
are derived from experience but here is a discrepancy in the manner
and source of the experience, how are they to be included in the
same species? And again, if some create the experience, others are
created by it, the term Quality as applied to both classes will be
equivocal.

<P>And what part is played by the individual form? If it
constitutes the individual's specific character, it is not a
quality; if, however, it is what makes an object beautiful or ugly
after the specific form has been determined, then it involves a
Reason-Principle.

<P>Rough and smooth, tenuous and dense may rightly be classed as
qualities. It is true that they are not determined by distances and
approximations, or in general by even or uneven dispositions, of
parts; though, were they so determined, they might well even then be
qualities.

<P>Knowledge of the meaning of "light" and "heavy" will reveal
their place in the classification. An ambiguity will however 
be latent
in the term "light," unless it be determined by comparative 
weight: it
would then implicate leanness and fineness, and involve another
species distinct from the four [of Aristotle].
