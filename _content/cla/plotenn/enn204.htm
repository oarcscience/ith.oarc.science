<P>18. Souls vary in worth; and the difference is due, among other
causes, to an almost initial inequality; it is in reason that,
standing to the Reason-Principle, as parts, they should be unequal
by the fact of becoming separate.

<P>We must also remember that every Soul has its second 
grade and its
third, and that, therefore, its expression may take any one of three
main forms. But this point must be dealt with here again: the matter
requires all possible elucidation.

<P>We may perhaps think of actors having the right to add something
to the poet's words: the drama as it stands is not perfectly filled
in, and they are to supply where the Author has left blank 
spaces here
and there; the actors are to be something else as well; they become
parts of the poet, who on his side has a foreknowledge of the word
they will add, and so is able to bind into one story what the actors
bring in and what is to follow.

<P>For, in the All, the sequences, including what follows upon
wickedness, become Reason-Principles, and therefore in right reason.
Thus: from adultery and the violation of prisoners the process of
nature will produce fine children, to grow, perhaps, into fine men;
and where wicked violence has destroyed cities, other and nobler
cities may rise in their place.

<P>But does not this make it absurd to introduce Souls as 
responsible
causes, some acting for good and some for evil? If we thus exonerate
the Reason-Principle from any part in wickedness do we not 
also cancel
its credit for the good? Why not simply take the doings of these
actors for representative parts of the Reason-Principle as the
doings of stage-actors are representative parts of the stage-drama?
Why not admit that the Reason-Principle itself includes evil 
action as
much as good action, and inspires the precise conduct of all its
representatives? Would not this be all the more Plausible in that
the universal drama is the completer creation and that the
Reason-Principle is the source of all that exists?

<P>But this raises the question: "What motive could lead 
the Logos to
produce evil?"

<P>The explanation, also, would take away all power in the Universe
from Souls, even those nearest to the divine; they would all be mere
parts of a Reason-Principle.

<P>And, further- unless all Reason-Principles are Souls- why should
some be souls and others exclusively Reason-Principles when 
the All is
itself a Soul?
