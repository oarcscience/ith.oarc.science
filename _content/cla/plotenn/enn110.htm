<P>8. Soul, then, in the same way, is intent upon a task of its
own; alike in its direct course and in its divagation it is the
cause of all by its possession of the Thought of the First
Principle: thus a Law of Justice goes with all that exists in the
Universe which, otherwise, would be dissolved, and is perdurable
because the entire fabric is guided as much by the orderliness as by
the power of the controlling force. And in this order the stars, as
being no minor members of the heavenly system, are co-operators
contributing at once to its stately beauty and to its symbolic
quality. Their symbolic power extends to the entire realm of sense,
their efficacy only to what they patently do.

<P>For our part, nature keeps us upon the work of the Soul 
as long as
we are not wrecked in the multiplicity of the Universe: once 
thus sunk
and held we pay the penalty, which consists both in the fall itself
and in the lower rank thus entailed upon us: riches and poverty are
caused by the combinations of external fact.

<P>And what of virtue and vice?

<P>That question has been amply discussed elsewhere: in a word,
virtue is ours by the ancient staple of the Soul; vice is due to the
commerce of a Soul with the outer world.
