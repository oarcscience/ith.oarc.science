<P>6. Souls that descend, souls that change their state- 
these, then,
may be said to have memory, which deals with what has come and gone;
but what subjects of remembrance can there be for souls whose lot is
to remain unchanged?

<P>The question touches memory in the stars in general, and also in
the sun and moon and ends by dealing with the soul of the 
All, even by
audaciously busying itself with the memories of Zeus himself. The
enquiry entails the examination and identification of acts of
understanding and of reasoning in these beings, if such acts take
place.

<P>Now if, immune from all lack, they neither seek nor doubt, and
never learn, nothing being absent at any time from their knowledge-
what reasonings, what processes of rational investigation, can take
place in them, what acts of the understanding?

<P>Even as regards human concerns they have no need for observation
or method; their administration of our affairs and of earth's in
general does not go so; the right ordering, which is their 
gift to the
universe, is effected by methods very different.

<P>In other words, they have seen God and they do not remember?

<P>Ah, no: it is that they see God still and always, and that, as
long as they see, they cannot tell themselves they have had the
vision; such reminiscence is for souls that have lost it.
