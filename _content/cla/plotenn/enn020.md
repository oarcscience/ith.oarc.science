#### Section 3

3\. We come now to that other mode of Likeness which, we read, is the
fruit of the loftier virtues: discussing this we shall penetrate more
deeply into the essence of the Civic Virtue and be able to define the
nature of the higher kind whose existence we shall establish beyond
doubt.

To Plato, unmistakably, there are two distinct orders of virtue, and the
civic does not suffice for Likeness: "Likeness to God," he says, "is a
flight from this world's ways and things": in dealing with the qualities
of good citizenship he does not use the simple term Virtue but adds the
distinguishing word civic: and elsewhere he declares all the virtues
without exception to be purifications.

But in what sense can we call the virtues purifications, and how does
purification issue in Likeness?

As the Soul is evil by being interfused with the body, and by coming to
share the body's states and to think the body's thoughts, so it would be
good, it would be possessed of virtue, if it threw off the body's moods
and devoted itself to its own Act- the state of Intellection and Wisdom-
never allowed the passions of the body to affect it- the virtue of
Sophrosyne- knew no fear at the parting from the body- the virtue of
Fortitude- and if reason and the Intellectual-Principle ruled- in which
state is Righteousness. Such a disposition in the Soul, become thus
intellective and immune to passion, it would not be wrong to call
Likeness to God; for the Divine, too, is pure and the Divine-Act is such
that Likeness to it is Wisdom.

But would not this make virtue a state of the Divine also?

No: the Divine has no states; the state is in the Soul. The Act of
Intellection in the Soul is not the same as in the Divine: of things in
the Supreme, Soul grasps some after a mode of its own, some not at all.

Then yet again, the one word Intellection covers two distinct Acts?

Rather there is primal Intellection and there is Intellection deriving
from the Primal and of other scope.

As speech is the echo of the thought in the Soul, so thought in the Soul
is an echo from elsewhere: that is to say, as the uttered thought is an
image of the soul-thought, so the soul-thought images a thought above
itself and is the interpreter of the higher sphere.

Virtue, in the same way, is a thing of the Soul: it does not belong to
the Intellectual-Principle or to the Transcendence.
