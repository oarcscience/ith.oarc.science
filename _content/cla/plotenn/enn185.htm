<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 10</H4>

<P>10. To sum the results of our argument: All things and events
are foreshown and brought into being by causes; but the causation is
of two Kinds; there are results originating from the Soul and
results due to other causes, those of the environment.

<P>In the action of our Souls all that is done of their own 
motion in
the light of sound reason is the Soul's work, while what is 
done where
they are hindered from their own action is not so much done as
suffered. Unwisdom, then, is not due to the Soul, and, in general-
if we mean by Fate a compulsion outside ourselves- an act is fated
when it is contrary to wisdom.

<P>But all our best is of our own doing: such is our nature as long
as we remain detached. The wise and good do perform acts; their
right action is the expression of their own power: in the others it
comes in the breathing spaces when the passions are in abeyance; but
it is not that they draw this occasional wisdom from outside
themselves; simply, they are for the time being unhindered.

<P></P>
