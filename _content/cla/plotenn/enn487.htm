<P>10. This is why Zeus, although the oldest of the gods and their
sovereign, advances first [in the Phaidros myth] towards that
vision, followed by gods and demigods and such souls as are of
strength to see. That Being appears before them from some 
unseen place
and rising loftily over them pours its light upon all things, so
that all gleams in its radiance; it upholds some beings, and 
they see;
the lower are dazzled and turn away, unfit to gaze upon that sun,
the trouble falling the more heavily on those most remote.

<P>Of those looking upon that Being and its content, and 
able to see,
all take something but not all the same vision always: intently
gazing, one sees the fount and principle of Justice, another 
is filled
with the sight of Moral Wisdom, the original of that quality 
as found,
sometimes at least, among men, copied by them in their 
degree from the
divine virtue which, covering all the expanse, so to speak, of the
Intellectual Realm is seen, last attainment of all, by those who
have known already many splendid visions.

<P>The gods see, each singly and all as one. So, too, the 
souls; they
see all There in right of being sprung, themselves, of that universe
and therefore including all from beginning to end and having their
existence There if only by that phase which belongs inherently to
the Divine, though often too they are There entire, those of 
them that
have not incurred separation.

<P>This vision Zeus takes, and it is for such of us, also, as share
his love and appropriate our part in the Beauty There, the final
object of all seeing, the entire beauty upon all things; for 
all There
sheds radiance, and floods those that have found their way thither
so that they too become beautiful; thus it will often happen that
men climbing heights where the soil has taken a yellow glow will
themselves appear so, borrowing colour from the place on which they
move. The colour flowering on that other height we speak of 
is Beauty;
or rather all There is light and beauty, through and through, for
the beauty is no mere bloom upon the surface.

<P>To those that do not see entire, the immediate 
impression is alone
taken into account; but those drunken with this wine, filled with
the nectar, all their soul penetrated by this beauty, cannot remain
mere gazers: no longer is there a spectator outside gazing on an
outside spectacle; the clear-eyed hold the vision within themselves,
though, for the most part, they have no idea that it is within but
look towards it as to something beyond them and see it as an 
object of
vision caught by a direction of the will.

<P>All that one sees as a spectacle is still external; one 
must bring
the vision within and see no longer in that mode of separation but
as we know ourselves; thus a man filled with a god- possessed by
Apollo or by one of the Muses- need no longer look outside for his
vision of the divine being; it is but finding the strength to see
divinity within.
