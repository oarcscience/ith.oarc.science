<P>15. How then do the four genera complete Substance without
qualifying it or even particularizing it?

<P>It has been observed that Being is primary, and it is clear that
none of the four- Motion, Stability, Difference, Identity- 
is distinct
from it. That this Motion does not produce Quality is doubtless also
clear, but a word or two will make it clearer still.

<P>If Motion is the Act of Substance, and Being and the Primaries
in general are its Act, then Motion is not an accidental 
attribute: as
the Act of what is necessarily actual [what necessarily 
involves Act],
it is no longer to be considered as the complement of 
Substance but as
Substance itself. For this reason, then, it has not been 
assigned to a
posterior class, or referred to Quality, but has been made
contemporary with Being.

<P>The truth is not that Being first is and then takes Motion,
first is and then acquires Stability: neither Stability nor Motion
is a mere modification of Being. Similarly, Identity and Difference
are not later additions: Being did not grow into plurality; its very
unity was a plurality; but plurality implies Difference, and
unity-in-plurality involves Identity.

<P>Substance [Real Being] requires no more than these five
constituents; but when we have to turn to the lower sphere, we find
other principles giving rise no longer to Substance (as such) but to
quantitative Substance and qualitative: these other principles may
be regarded as genera but not primary genera.
