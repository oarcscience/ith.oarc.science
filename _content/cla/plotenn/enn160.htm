<P>5. Still more unreasonably:

<P>There are men, bound to human bodies and subject to 
desire, grief,
anger, who think so generously of their own faculty that they
declare themselves in contact with the Intelligible World, but deny
that the sun possesses a similar faculty less subject to 
influence, to
disorder, to change; they deny that it is any wiser than we, the
late born, hindered by so many cheats on the way towards truth.

<P>Their own soul, the soul of the least of mankind, they declare
deathless, divine; but the entire heavens and the stars within the
heavens have had no communion with the Immortal Principle, though
these are far purer and lovelier than their own souls- yet they are
not blind to the order, the shapely pattern, the discipline 
prevailing
in the heavens, since they are the loudest in complaint of the
disorder that troubles our earth. We are to imagine the 
deathless Soul
choosing of design the less worthy place, and preferring to abandon
the nobler to the Soul that is to die.

<P>Equally unreasonable is their introduction of that other Soul
which they piece together from the elements.

<P>How could any form or degree of life come about by a blend of
the elements? Their conjunction could produce only a warm or cold or
an intermediate substance, something dry or wet or intermediate.

<P>Besides, how could such a soul be a bond holding the 
four elements
together when it is a later thing and rises from them? And this
element- soul is described as possessing consciousness and will and
the rest- what can we think?

<P>Furthermore, these teachers, in their contempt for this creation
and this earth, proclaim that another earth has been made for them
into which they are to enter when they depart. Now this new earth is
the Reason-Form [the Logos] of our world. Why should they desire to
live in the archetype of a world abhorrent to them?

<P>Then again, what is the origin of that pattern world? It would
appear, from the theory, that the Maker had already declined towards
the things of this sphere before that pattern came into being.

<P>Now let us suppose the Maker craving to construct such an
Intermediate World- though what motive could He have?- in addition
to the Intellectual world which He eternally possesses. If 
He made the
mid-world first, what end was it to serve?

<P>To be a dwelling-place for Souls?

<P>How then did they ever fall from it? It exists in vain.

<P>If He made it later than this world- abstracting the formal-idea
of this world and leaving the Matter out- the Souls that have come
to know that intermediate sphere would have experienced 
enough to keep
them from entering this. If the meaning is simply that Souls exhibit
the Ideal-Form of the Universe, what is there distinctive in the
teaching?
