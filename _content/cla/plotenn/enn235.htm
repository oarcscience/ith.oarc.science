<P>4. We have, however, still to examine what is called the 
affective
phase of the Soul. This has, no doubt, been touched upon above where
we dealt with the passions in general as grouped about the
initiative phase of the Soul and the desiring faculty in its 
effort to
shape things to its choice: but more is required; we must begin by
forming a clear idea of what is meant by this affective 
faculty of the
Soul.

<P>In general terms it means the centre about which we recognize
the affections to be grouped; and by affections we mean those states
upon which follow pleasure and pain.

<P>Now among these affections we must distinguish. Some are pivoted
upon judgements; thus, a Man judging his death to be at hand may
feel fear; foreseeing some fortunate turn of events, he is happy:
the opinion lies in one sphere; the affection is stirred in another.
Sometimes the affections take the lead and automatically bring in
the notion which thus becomes present to the appropriate faculty:
but as we have explained, an act of opinion does not introduce any
change into the Soul or Mind: what happens is that from the notion
of some impending evil is produced the quite separate thing, 
fear, and
this fear, in turn, becomes known in that part of the Mind which is
said under such circumstances to harbour fear.

<P>But what is the action of this fear upon the Mind?

<P>The general answer is that it sets up trouble and 
confusion before
an evil anticipated. It should, however, be quite clear that the
Soul or Mind is the seat of all imaginative representation- both the
higher representation known as opinion or judgement and the lower
representation which is not so much a judgement as a vague notion
unattended by discrimination, something resembling the action by
which, as is believed, the "Nature" of common speech produces,
unconsciously, the objects of the partial sphere. It is equally
certain that in all that follows upon the mental act or state, the
disturbance, confined to the body, belongs to the sense-order;
trembling, pallor, inability to speak, have obviously nothing to do
with the spiritual portion of the being. The Soul, in fact, 
would have
to be described as corporeal if it were the seat of such symptoms:
besides, in that case the trouble would not even reach the body
since the only transmitting principle, oppressed by sensation,
jarred out of itself, would be inhibited.

<P>None the less, there is an affective phase of the Soul 
or Mind and
this is not corporeal; it can be, only, some kind of Ideal-form.

<P>Now Matter is the one field of the desiring faculty, as of the
principles of nutrition growth and engendering, which are root and
spring to desire and to every other affection known to this
Ideal-form. No Ideal-form can be the victim of disturbance or be in
any way affected: it remains in tranquillity; only the Matter
associated with it can be affected by any state or experience
induced by the movement which its mere presence suffices to set up.
Thus the vegetal Principle induces vegetal life but it does not,
itself, pass through the processes of vegetation; it gives growth
but it does not grow; in no movement which it originates is it moved
with the motion it induces; it is in perfect repose, or, at 
least, its
movement, really its act, is utterly different from what it causes
elsewhere.

<P>The nature of an Ideal-form is to be, of itself, an activity; it
operates by its mere presence: it is as if Melody itself plucked the
strings. The affective phase of the Soul or Mind will be the 
operative
cause of all affection; it originates the movement either under the
stimulus of some sense-presentment or independently- and it is a
question to be examined whether the judgement leading to the
movement operates from above or not- but the affective phase itself
remains unmoved like Melody dictating music. The causes originating
the movement may be likened to the musician; what is moved 
is like the
strings of his instrument, and once more, the Melodic 
Principle itself
is not affected, but only the strings, though, however much the
musician desired it, he could not pluck the strings except under
dictation from the principle of Melody.
