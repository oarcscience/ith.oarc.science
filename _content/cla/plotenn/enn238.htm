<P>7. We are thus brought back to the nature of that underlying
matter and the things believed to be based upon it; 
investigation will
show us that Matter has no reality and is not capable of being
affected.

<P>Matter must be bodiless- for body is a later production, a
compound made by Matter in conjunction with some other 
entity. Thus it
is included among incorporeal things in the sense that body is
something that is neither Real-Being nor Matter.

<P>Matter is no Soul; it is not Intellect, is not Life, is no
Ideal-Principle, no Reason-Principle; it is no limit or bound, for
it is mere indetermination; it is not a power, for what does it
produce?

<P>It lives on the farther side of all these categories and 
so has no
tide to the name of Being. It will be more plausibly called a
non-being, and this in the sense not of movement [away from Being]
or station (in Not-Being) but of veritable Not-Being, so 
that it is no
more than the image and phantasm of Mass, a bare aspiration towards
substantial existence; it is stationary but not in the sense 
of having
position, it is in itself invisible, eluding all effort to 
observe it,
present where no one can look, unseen for all our gazing,
ceaselessly presenting contraries in the things based upon it; it is
large and small, more and less, deficient and excessive; a phantasm
unabiding and yet unable to withdraw- not even strong enough to
withdraw, so utterly has it failed to accept strength from the
Intellectual Principle, so absolute its lack of all Being.

<P>Its every utterance, therefore, is a lie; it pretends to be
great and it is little, to be more and it is less; and the Existence
with which it masks itself is no Existence, but a passing 
trick making
trickery of all that seems to be present in it, phantasms within a
phantasm; it is like a mirror showing things as in itself when they
are really elsewhere, filled in appearance but actually empty,
containing nothing, pretending everything. Into it and out of it
move mimicries of the Authentic Existents, images playing upon an
image devoid of Form, visible against it by its very formlessness;
they seem to modify it but in reality effect nothing, for they are
ghostly and feeble, have no thrust and meet none in Matter either;
they pass through it leaving no cleavage, as through water; or they
might be compared to shapes projected so as to make some appearance
upon what we can know only as the Void.

<P>Further: if visible objects were of the rank of the 
originals from
which they have entered into Matter we might believe Matter to be
really affected by them, for we might credit them with some share of
the power inherent in their Senders: but the objects of our
experiences are of very different virtue than the realities they
represent, and we deduce that the seeming modification of matter by
visible things is unreal since the visible thing itself is unreal,
having at no point any similarity with its source and cause. Feeble,
in itself, a false thing and projected upon a falsity, like an image
in dream or against water or on a mirror, it can but leave Matter
unaffected; and even this is saying too little, for water and mirror
do give back a faithful image of what presents itself before them.
