<P>39. We cannot, then, refer all that exists to Reason-Principles
inherent in the seed of things [Spermatic Reasons]; the 
universe is to
be traced further back, to the more primal forces, to the principles
by which that seed itself takes shape. Such spermatic principles
cannot be the containers of things which arise independently of
them, such as what enters from Matter [the reasonless] into 
membership
of the All, or what is due to the mere interaction of existences.

<P>No: the Reason-Principle of the universe would be better 
envisaged
as a wisdom uttering order and law to a state, in full knowledge of
what the citizens will do and why, and in perfect adaptation 
of law to
custom; thus the code is made to thread its way in and out 
through all
their conditions and actions with the honour or infamy 
earned by their
conduct; and all coalesces by a kind of automatism.

<P>The signification which exists is not a first intention; 
it arises
incidentally by the fact that in a given collocation the members
will tell something of each other: all is unity sprung of unity and
therefore one thing is known by way of another other, a cause in the
light of the caused, the sequent as rising from its precedent, the
compound from the constituents which must make themselves 
known in the
linked total.

<P>If all this is sound, at once our doubts fall and we need no
longer ask whether the transmission of any evil is due to the gods.

<P>For, in sum: Firstly, intentions are not to be considered as the
operative causes; necessities inherent in the nature of 
things account
for all that comes from the other realm; it is a matter of the
inevitable relation of parts, and, besides, all is the 
sequence to the
living existence of a unity. Secondly, there is the large 
contribution
made by the individual. Thirdly, each several communication, good in
itself, takes another quality in the resultant combination.
Fourthly, the life in the kosmos does not look to the individual but
to the whole. Finally, there is Matter, the underlie, which being
given one thing receives it as something else, and is unable to make
the best of what it takes.
