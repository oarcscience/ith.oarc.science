<P>9. What, then, is the content- inevitably separated by our
minds- of this one Intellectual-Principle? For there is no resource
but to represent the items in accessible form just as we study the
various articles constituting one science.

<P>This universe is a living thing capable of including 
every form of
life; but its Being and its modes are derived from elsewhere; that
source is traced back to the Intellectual-Principle: it follows that
the all-embracing archetype is in the Intellectual-Principle, which,
therefore, must be an intellectual Kosmos, that indicated by Plato
in the phrase "The living existent."

<P>Given the Reason-Principle [the outgoing divine Idea] of 
a certain
living thing and the Matter to harbour this seed-principle, 
the living
thing must come into being: in the same way once there exists- an
intellective Nature, all powerful, and with nothing to check 
it- since
nothing intervenes between it and that which is of a nature 
to receive
it- inevitably the higher imprints form and the lower 
accepts, it. The
recipient holds the Idea in division, here man, there sun, while in
the giver all remains in unity.
