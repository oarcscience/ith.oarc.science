<P>13. Those, then, that censure the constitution of the Kosmos do
not understand what they are doing or where this audacity leads
them. They do not understand that there is a successive order of
Primals, Secondaries, Tertiaries and so on continuously to the
Ultimates; that nothing is to be blamed for being inferior to the
First; that we can but accept, meekly, the constitution of the
total, and make our best way towards the Primals, 
withdrawing from the
tragic spectacle, as they see it, of the Kosmic spheres- which in
reality are all suave graciousness.

<P>And what, after all, is there so terrible in these Spheres with
which it is sought to frighten people unaccustomed to thinking,
never trained in an instructive and coherent gnosis?

<P>Even the fact that their material frame is of fire does not make
them dreadful; their Movements are in keeping with the All and with
the Earth: but what we must consider in them is the Soul, that on
which these people base their own title to honour.

<P>And, yet, again, their material frames are pre-eminent 
in vastness
and beauty, as they cooperate in act and in influence with the
entire order of Nature, and can never cease to exist as long as the
Primals stand; they enter into the completion of the All of 
which they
are major Parts.

<P>If men rank highly among other living Beings, much more do
these, whose office in the All is not to play the tyrant but to
serve towards beauty and order. The action attributed to them must
be understood as a foretelling of coming events, while the causing
of all the variety is due, in part to diverse destinies- for there
cannot be one lot for the entire body of men- in part to the birth
moment, in part to wide divergencies of place, in part to states of
the Souls.

<P>Once more, we have no right to ask that all men shall be good,
or to rush into censure because such universal virtue is not 
possible:
this would be repeating the error of confusing our sphere with the
Supreme and treating evil as a nearly negligible failure in 
wisdom- as
good lessened and dwindling continuously, a continuous fading out;
it would be like calling the Nature-Principle evil because it is not
Sense-Perception and the thing of sense evil for not being a
Reason-Principle. If evil is no more than that, we will be obliged
to admit evil in the Supreme also, for there, too, Soul is less
exalted than the Intellectual-Principle, and That too has its
Superior.
