#### Section 2

2\. The born lover, to whose degree the musician also may attain- and
then either come to a stand or pass beyond- has a certain memory of
beauty but, severed from it now, he no longer comprehends it: spellbound
by visible loveliness he clings amazed about that. His lesson must be to
fall down no longer in bewildered delight before some, one embodied
form; he must be led, under a system of mental discipline, to beauty
everywhere and made to discern the One Principle underlying all, a
Principle apart from the material forms, springing from another source,
and elsewhere more truly present. The beauty, for example, in a noble
course of life and in an admirably organized social system may be
pointed out to him- a first training this in the loveliness of the
immaterial- he must learn to recognise the beauty in the arts, sciences,
virtues; then these severed and particular forms must be brought under
the one principle by the explanation of their origin. From the virtues
he is to be led to the Intellectual-Principle, to the
Authentic-Existent; thence onward, he treads the upward way.
