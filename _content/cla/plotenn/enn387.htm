<P>8. A. [sometimes appearing as 9] There are those who 
insist on the
activities observed in bodies- warming, chilling, thrusting, 
pressing-
and class soul with body, as it were to assure its efficacy. This
ignores the double fact that the very bodies themselves exercise
such efficiency by means of the incorporeal powers operating in
them, and that these are not the powers we attribute to soul:
intellection, perception, reasoning, desire, wise and 
effective action
in all regards, these point to a very different form of being.

<P>In transferring to bodies the powers of the unembodied, this
school leaves nothing to that higher order. And yet that it is
precisely in virtue of bodiless powers that bodies possess their
efficiency is clear from certain reflections:

<P>It will be admitted that quality and quantity are two different
things, that body is always a thing of quantity but not 
always a thing
of quality: matter is not qualified. This admitted, it will not be
denied that quality, being a different thing from quantity, is a
different thing from body. Obviously quality could not be 
body when it
has not quantity as all body must; and, again, as we have said,
body, any thing of mass, on being reduced to fragments, ceases to be
what it was, but the quality it possessed remains intact in every
particle- for instance the sweetness of honey is still sweetness in
each speck- this shows that sweetness and all other qualities are
not body.

<P>Further: if the powers in question were bodies, then necessarily
the stronger powers would be large masses and those less efficient
small masses: but if there are large masses with small while 
not a few
of the smaller masses manifest great powers, then the efficiency
must be vested in something other than magnitude; efficacy, thus,
belongs to non-magnitude. Again; Matter, they tell us, remains
unchanged as long as it is body, but produces variety upon accepting
qualities; is not this proof enough that the entrants [with whose
arrival the changes happen] are Reason-Principles and not of the
bodily order?

<P>They must not remind us that when pneuma and blood are no longer
present, animals die: these are necessary no doubt to life, 
but so are
many other things of which none could possibly be soul: and neither
pneuma nor blood is present throughout the entire being; but soul is.
