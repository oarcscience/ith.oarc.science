<P>8. What, then, is this Kind, this Matter, described as one
stuff, continuous and without quality?

<P>Clearly since it is without quality it is incorporeal;
bodiliness would be quality.

<P>It must be the basic stuff of all the entities of the
sense-world and not merely base to some while being to 
others achieved
form.

<P>Clay, for example, is matter to the potter but is not Matter
pure and simple. Nothing of this sort is our object: we are seeking
the stuff which underlies all alike. We must therefore refuse to it
all that we find in things of sense- not merely such attributes as
colour, heat or cold, but weight or weightlessness, thickness or
thinness, shape and therefore magnitude; though notice that to be
present within magnitude and shape is very different from possessing
these qualities.

<P>It cannot be a compound, it must be a simplex, one distinct
thing in its nature; only so can it be void of all quality. The
Principle which gives it form gives this as something alien: so with
magnitude and all really-existent things bestowed upon it. If, for
example, it possessed a magnitude of its own, the Principle giving
it form would be at the mercy of that magnitude and must produce not
at will, but only within the limit of the Matter's capacity: to
imagine that Will keeping step with its material is fantastic.

<P>The Matter must be of later origin than the forming-power, and
therefore must be at its disposition throughout, ready to become
anything, ready therefore to any bulk; besides, if it possessed
magnitude, it would necessarily possess shape also: it would 
be doubly
inductile.

<P>No: all that ever appears upon it is brought in by the Idea: the
Idea alone possesses: to it belongs the magnitude and all else that
goes with the Reason-Principle or follows upon it. Quantity is given
with the Ideal-Form in all the particular species- man, bird, and
particular kind of bird.

<P>The imaging of Quantity upon Matter by an outside power is not
more surprising than the imaging of Quality; Quality is no doubt a
Reason-Principle, but Quantity also- being measure, number- 
is equally
so.
