<P>13. With regard to Date:

<P>If "yesterday," "to-morrow," "last year" and similar terms
denote parts of time, why should they not be included in the same
genus as time? It would seem only reasonable to range under time the
past, present and future, which are its species. But time is
referred to Quantity; what then is the need for a separate 
category of
Date?

<P>If we are told that past and future- including under past such
definite dates as yesterday and last year which must clearly be
subordinate to past time- and even the present "now" are not merely
time but time- when, we reply, in the first place, that the notion
of time- when involves time; that, further, if "yesterday" is
time-gone-by, it will be a composite, since time and gone-by are
distinct notions: we have two categories instead of the single one
required.

<P>But suppose that Date is defined not as time but as that which
is in time; if by that which is in time is meant the 
subject- Socrates
in the proposition "Socrates existed last year"- that subject is
external to the notion of time, and we have again a duality.

<P>Consider, however, the proposition "Socrates- or some action-
exists at this time"; what can be the meaning here other than "in a
part of time"? But if, admitted that Date is "a part of time," it be
felt that the part requires definition and involves something more
than mere time, that we must say the part of time gone by, several
notions are massed in the proposition: we have the part 
which qua part
is a relative; and we have "gone-by" which, if it is to have any
import at all, must mean the past: but this "past," we have shown,
is a species of time.

<P>It may be urged that "the past" is in its nature 
indefinite, while
"yesterday" and "last year" are definite. We reply, first, that we
demand some place in our classification for the past: secondly, that
"yesterday," as definite past, is necessarily definite time. But
definite time implies a certain quantity of time: therefore, if time
is quantitative, each of the terms in question must signify 
a definite
quantity.

<P>Again, if by "yesterday" we are expected to understand that this
or that event has taken Place at a definite time gone by, we 
have more
notions than ever. Besides, if we must introduce fresh categories
because one thing acts in another- as in this case something acts in
time- we have more again from its acting upon another in 
another. This
point will be made plain by what follows in our discussion of Place.
