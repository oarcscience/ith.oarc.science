<P>20. The difficulty will be raised that God would seem to have
existed before thus coming into existence; if He makes Himself, then
in regard to the self which He makes He is not yet in being and as
maker He exists before this Himself thus made.

<P>The answer is that we utterly must not speak of Him as made but
sheerly as maker; the making must be taken as absolved from all
else; no new existence is established; the Act here is not 
directed to
an achievement but is God Himself unalloyed: here is no duality but
pure unity. Let no one suspect us of asserting that the 
first Activity
is without Essence; on the contrary the Activity is the very
reality. To suppose a reality without activity would be to make the
Principle of all principles deficient; the supremely complete
becomes incomplete. To make the Activity something superadded to
the essence is to shatter the unity. If then Activity is a more
perfect thing than essence and the First is all perfect, then the
Activity is the First.

<P>By having acted, He is what He is and there is no question of
"existing before bringing Himself into existence"; when He acted He
was not in some state that could be described as "before 
existing." He
was already existent entirely.

<P>Now assuredly an Activity not subjected essence is utterly free;
God's selfhood, then, is of his own Act. If his being has to be
ensured by something else, He is no longer the self-existent 
First: if
it be true to say that He is his own container, then He inducts
Himself; for all that He contains is his own production from the
beginning since from the beginning He caused the being of all that
by nature He contains.

<P>If there had been a moment from which He began to be, it would
be possible assert his self-making in the literal sense; but, since
what He is He is from before all time, his self-making is to be
understood as simultaneous with Himself; the being is one 
and the same
with the making and eternal "coming into existence."

<P>This is the source also of his self-disposal- strictly
applicable if there were a duality, but conveying, in the case of a
unity, a disposing without a disposed, an abstract disposing. But
how a disposer with nothing to dispose? In that there is here a
disposer looking to a prior when there is none: since there is no
prior, This is the First- but a First not in order but in 
sovereignty,
in power purely self-controlled. Purely; then nothing can be There
that is under any external disposition; all in God is self-willing.
What then is there of his content that is not Himself, what that is
not in Act, what not his work? Imagine in Him anything not of his
Act and at once His existence ceases to be pure; He is not
self-disposing, not all-powerful: in that at least of whose doing He
is not master He would be impotent.
