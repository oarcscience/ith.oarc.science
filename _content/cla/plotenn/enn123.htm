<P>2. We are obliged, therefore, at the start, both to establish
the existence of this other Kind and to examine its nature and the
mode of its Being.

<P>Now if Matter must characteristically be undetermined, void of
shape, while in that sphere of the Highest there can be nothing that
lacks determination, nothing shapeless, there can be no Matter
there. Further, if all that order is simplex, there can be no need
of Matter, whose function is to join with some other element 
to form a
compound: it will be found of necessity in things of derived 
existence
and shifting nature- the signs which lead us to the notion of
Matter- but it is unnecessary to the primal.

<P>And again, where could it have come from? whence did it take its
being? If it is derived, it has a source: if it is eternal, then the
Primal-Principles are more numerous than we thought, the Firsts are
a meeting-ground. Lastly, if that Matter has been entered by 
Idea, the
union constitutes a body; and, so, there is Body in the Supreme.
