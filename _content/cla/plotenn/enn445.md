#### Section 14

14\. How, then, do we ourselves come to be speaking of it?

No doubt we deal with it, but we do not state it; we have neither
knowledge nor intellection of it.

But in what sense do we even deal with it when we have no hold upon it?

We do not, it is true, grasp it by knowledge, but that does not mean
that we are utterly void of it; we hold it not so as to state it, but so
as to be able to speak about it. And we can and do state what it is not,
while we are silent as to what it is: we are, in fact, speaking of it in
the light of its sequels; unable to state it, we may still possess it.

Those divinely possessed and inspired have at least the knowledge that
they hold some greater thing within them though they cannot tell what it
is; from the movements that stir them and the utterances that come from
them they perceive the power, not themselves, that moves them: in the
same way, it must be, we stand towards the Supreme when we hold the
Intellectual-Principle pure; we know the divine Mind within, that which
gives Being and all else of that order: but we know, too, that other,
know that it is none of these, but a nobler principle than any-thing we
know as Being; fuller and greater; above reason, mind and feeling;
conferring these powers, not to be confounded with them.
