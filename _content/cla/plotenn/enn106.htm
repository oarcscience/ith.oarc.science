<P>4. It is again not in reason that a particular star should be
gladdened by seeing this or that other while, in a second 
couple, such
an aspect is distressing: what enmities can affect such beings? what
causes of enmity can there be among them?

<P>And why should there be any difference as a given star sees
certain others from the corner of a triangle or in opposition or at
the angle of a square?

<P>Why, again, should it see its fellow from some one given
position and yet, in the next Zodiacal figure, not see it, though
the two are actually nearer?

<P>And, the cardinal question; by what conceivable process 
could they
affect what is attributed to them? How explain either the action of
any single star independently or, still more perplexing, the 
effect of
their combined intentions?

<P>We cannot think of them entering into compromises, each 
renouncing
something of its efficiency and their final action in our regard
amounting to a concerted plan.

<P>No one star would suppress the contribution of another, nor
would star yield to star and shape its conduct under suasion.

<P>As for the fancy that while one is glad when it enters another's
region, the second is vexed when in its turn it occupies the place
of the first, surely this is like starting with the 
supposition of two
friends and then going on to talk of one being attracted to the
other who, however, abhors the first.
