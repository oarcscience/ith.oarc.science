<P>14. What of poverty and riches, glory and power?

<P>In the case of inherited fortune, the stars merely 
announce a rich
man, exactly as they announce the high social standing of the child
born to a distinguished house.

<P>Wealth may be due to personal activity: in this case if the body
has contributed, part of the effect is due to whatever has 
contributed
towards the physical powers, first the parents and then, if place
has had its influence, sky and earth; if the body has borne 
no part of
the burden, then the success, and all the splendid accompaniments
added by the Recompensers, must be attributed to virtue exclusively.
If fortune has come by gift from the good, then the source of the
wealth is, again, virtue: if by gift from the evil, but to a
meritorious recipient, then the credit must be given to the action
of the best in them: if the recipient is himself unprincipled, the
wealth must be attributed primarily to the very wickedness and to
whatsoever is responsible for the wickedness, while the 
givers bear an
equal share in the wrong.

<P>When the success is due to labour, tillage for example, 
it must be
put down to the tiller, with all his environment as contributory. In
the case of treasure-trove, something from the All has entered into
action; and if this be so, it will be foreshown- since all 
things make
a chain, so that we can speak of things universally. Money 
is lost: if
by robbery, the blame lies with the robber and the native principle
guiding him: if by shipwreck, the cause is the chain of 
events. As for
good fame, it is either deserved and then is due to the services
done and to the merit of those appraising them, or it is undeserved,
and then must be attributed to the injustice of those making the
award. And the same principle holds is regards power- for this also
may be rightly or unrightly placed- it depends either upon the merit
of the dispensers of place or upon the man himself who has effected
his purpose by the organization of supporters or in many other
possible ways. Marriages, similarly, are brought about either by
choice or by chance interplay of circumstance. And births are
determined by marriages: the child is moulded true to type when all
goes well; otherwise it is marred by some inner detriment, something
due to the mother personally or to an environment 
unfavourable to that
particular conception.
