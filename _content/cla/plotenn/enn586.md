#### Section 26

26\. We may now take the various specific types of Motion, such as
locomotion, and once again enquire for each one whether it is not to be
divided on the basis of direction, up, down, straight, circular- a
question already raised; whether the organic motion should be
distinguished from the inorganic- they are clearly not alike; whether,
again, organic motions should be subdivided into walking, swimming and
flight.

Perhaps we should also distinguish, in each species, natural from
unnatural motions: this distinction would however imply that motions
have differences which are not external. It may indeed be the case that
motions create these differences and cannot exist without them; but
Nature may be supposed to be the ultimate source of motions and
differences alike.

Motions may also be classed as natural, artificial and purposive:
"natural" embracing growth and decay; "artificial" architecture and
shipbuilding; "purposive" enquiry, learning, government, and, in
general, all speech and action.

Again, with regard to growth, alteration and birth, the division may
proceed from the natural and unnatural, or, speaking generally, from the
characters of the moved objects.
