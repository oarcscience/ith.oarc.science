<P>17. But these Reason-Principles, contained in the Soul, are they
Thoughts?

<P>And if so, by what process does the Soul create in 
accordance with
these Thoughts?

<P>It is upon Matter that this act of the Reason is exercised; and
what acts physically is not an intellectual operation or a 
vision, but
a power modifying matter, not conscious of it but merely acting upon
it: the Reason-Principle, in other words, acts much like a force
producing a figure or pattern upon water- that of a circle, suppose,
where the formation of the ring is conditioned by something distinct
from that force itself.

<P>If this is so, the prior puissance of the Soul [that 
which conveys
the Reason-Principles] must act by manipulating the other Soul, that
which is united with Matter and has the generative function.

<P>But is this handling the result of calculation?

<P>Calculation implies reference. Reference, then, to something
outside or to something contained within itself? If to its own
content, there is no need of reasoning, which could not 
itself perform
the act of creation; creation is the operation of that phase of the
Soul which contains Ideal-Principles; for that is its stronger
puissance, its creative part.

<P>It creates, then, on the model of the Ideas; for, what it has
received from the Intellectual-Principle it must pass on in turn.

<P>In sum, then, the Intellectual-Principle gives from itself to
the Soul of the All which follows immediately upon it: this again
gives forth from itself to its next, illuminated and imprinted by
it; and that secondary Soul at once begins to create, as under
order, unhindered in some of its creations, striving in 
others against
the repugnance of Matter.

<P>It has a creative power, derived; it is stored with
Reason-Principles not the very originals: therefore it creates, but
not in full accordance with the Principles from which it has been
endowed: something enters from itself; and, plainly, this is 
inferior.
The issue then is something living, yes; but imperfect, hindering
its own life, something very poor and reluctant and crude, 
formed in a
Matter that is the fallen sediment of the Higher Order, bitter and
embittering. This is the Soul's contribution to the All.
