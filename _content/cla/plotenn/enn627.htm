<P>8. As then there is a Life-Form primal- which therefore is the
Life-Form Absolute- and there is Intellectual-Principle or Being,
Authentic Being, these, we affirm, contain all living things and all
Number, and Absolute Justice and Beauty and all of that order; for
we ascribe an existence of their own to Absolute Man, 
Absolute Number,
Absolute Justice. It remains to discover, in so far as such
knowledge is possible, how these distinct entities come to 
be and what
is the manner of their being.

<P>At the outset we must lay aside all sense-perception; by
Intellectual-Principle we know Intellectual-Principle. We reflect
within ourselves there is life, there is intellect, not in extension
but as power without magnitude, issue of Authentic Being which is
power self-existing, no vacuity but a thing most living and
intellective- nothing more living, more intelligent, more real- and
producing its effect by contact and in the ratio of the contact,
closely to the close, more remotely to the remote. If Being is to be
sought, then most be sought is Being at its intensest; so too the
intensest of Intellect if the Intellectual act has worth; 
and so, too,
of Life.

<P>First, then, we take Being as first in order; then
Intellectual-Principle; then the Living-Form considered as
containing all things: Intellectual-Principle, as the Act of Real
Being, is a second.

<P>Thus it is clear that Number cannot be dependent upon the
Living-Form since unity and duality existed before that; nor does it
rise in the Intellectual-Principle since before that there existed
Real Being which is both one and numerous.
