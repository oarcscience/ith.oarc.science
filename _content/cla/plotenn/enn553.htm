<P>16. As for Relation, manifestly an offshoot, how can it be
included among primaries? Relation is of thing ranged against thing;
it is not self-pivoted, but looks outward.

<P>Place and Date are still more remote from Being. Place 
denotes the
presence of one entity within another, so that it involves a
duality; but a genus must be a unity, not a composite. Besides,
Place does not exist in the higher sphere, and the present
discussion is concerned with the realm of True Being.

<P>Whether time is There, remains to be considered. 
Apparently it has
less claim than even Place. If it is a measurement, and that a
measurement of Motion, we have two entities; the whole is a
composite and posterior to Motion; therefore it is not on an equal
footing with Motion in our classification.

<P>Action and Passivity presuppose Motion; if, then, they exist in
the higher sphere, they each involve a duality; neither is a simplex.

<P>Possession is a duality, while Situation, as signifying one
thing situated in another, is a threefold conception.
