<P>1. Whether every human being is immortal or we are wholly
destroyed, or whether something of us passes over to dissolution and
destruction, while something else, that which is the true 
man, endures
for ever- this question will be answered here for those willing to
investigate our nature.

<P>We know that man is not a thing of one only element; he 
has a soul
and he has, whether instrument or adjunct in some other mode, a
body: this is the first distinction; it remains to investigate the
nature and essential being of these two constituents.

<P>Reason tells us that the body as, itself too, a composite,
cannot for ever hold together; and our senses show us it breaking
up, wearing out, the victim of destructive agents of many kinds,
each of its constituents going its own way, one part working against
another, perverting, wrecking, and this especially when the material
masses are no longer presided over by the reconciling soul.

<P>And when each single constituent is taken as a thing apart, it
is still not a unity; for it is divisible into shape and matter, the
duality without which bodies at their very simplest cannot cohere.

<P>The mere fact that, as material forms, they have bulk means that
they can be lopped and crushed and so come to destruction.

<P>If this body, then, is really a part of us, we are not wholly
immortal; if it is an instrument of ours, then, as a thing put at
our service for a certain time, it must be in its nature passing.

<P>The sovereign principle, the authentic man, will be as Form to
this Matter or as agent to this instrument, and thus, whatever that
relation be, the soul is the man.
