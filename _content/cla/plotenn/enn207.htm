<P>2. Circumstances are not sovereign over the good of 
life, for they
are themselves moulded by their priors and come in as members of a
sequence. The Leading-Principle holds all the threads while the
minor agents, the individuals, serve according to their own
capacities, as in a war the generalissimo lays down the plan and his
subordinates do their best to its furtherance. The Universe has been
ordered by a Providence that may be compared to a general; he has
considered operations, conditions and such practical needs 
as food and
drink, arms and engines of war; all the problem of reconciling these
complex elements has been worked out beforehand so as to make it
probable that the final event may be success. The entire scheme
emerges from the general's mind with a certain plausible promise,
though it cannot cover the enemy's operations, and there is no power
over the disposition of the enemy's forces: but where the mighty
general is in question whose power extends over all that is, what
can pass unordered, what can fail to fit into the plan?
