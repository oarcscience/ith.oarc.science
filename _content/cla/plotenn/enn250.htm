<P>19. The Ideal Principles entering into Matter as to a Mother [to
be "born into the Universe"] affect it neither for better nor for
worse.

<P>Their action is not upon Matter but upon each other; these
powers conflict with their opponent principles, not with their
substrata- which it would be foolish to confuse with the entrant
forms- Heat [the Principle] annuls Cold, and Blackness annuls
Whiteness; or, the opponents blend to form an intermediate quality.
Only that is affected which enters into combinations: being affected
is losing something of self-identity.

<P>In beings of soul and body, the affection occurs in the body,
modified according to the qualities and powers presiding at 
the act of
change: in all such dissolution of constituent parts, in the new
combinations, in all variation from the original structure, the
affection is bodily, the Soul or Mind having no more than an
accompanying knowledge of the more drastic changes, or perhaps not
even that. [Body is modified: Mind knows] but the Matter concerned
remains unaffected; heat enters, cold leaves it, and it is unchanged
because neither Principle is associated with it as friend or enemy.

<P>So the appellation "Recipient and Nurse" is the better
description: Matter is the mother only in the sense indicated; it
has no begetting power. But probably the term Mother is used by
those who think of a Mother as Matter to the offspring, as a 
container
only, giving nothing to them, the entire bodily frame of the child
being formed out of food. But if this Mother does give 
anything to the
offspring it does so not in its quality as Matter but as being an
Ideal-Form; for only the Idea is generative; the contrary Kind is
sterile.

<P>This, I think, is why the doctors of old, teaching 
through symbols
and mystic representations, exhibit the ancient Hermes with the
generative organ always in active posture; this is to convey that
the generator of things of sense is the Intellectual Reason 
Principle:
the sterility of Matter, eternally unmoved, is indicated by the
eunuchs surrounding it in its representation as the All-Mother.

<P>This too exalting title is conferred upon it in order to
indicate that it is the source of things in the sense of being their
underlie: it is an approximate name chosen for a general conception;
there is no intention of suggesting a complete parallel with
motherhood to those not satisfied with a surface impression but
needing a precisely true presentment; by a remote symbolism, the
nearest they could find, they indicate that Matter is sterile, not
female to full effect, female in receptivity only, not in pregnancy:
this they accomplish by exhibiting Matter as approached by what is
neither female nor effectively male, but castrated of that
impregnating power which belongs only to the unchangeably masculine.
