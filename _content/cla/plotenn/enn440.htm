<P>9. In order, then, to know what the Divine Mind is, we must
observe soul and especially its most God-like phase.

<P>One certain way to this knowledge is to separate first, the man
from the body- yourself, that is, from your body- next to put aside
that soul which moulded the body, and, very earnestly, the system of
sense with desires and impulses and every such futility, all setting
definitely towards the mortal: what is left is the phase of the soul
which we have declared to be an image of the Divine Intellect,
retaining some light from that sun, while it pours downward upon the
sphere of magnitudes [that is, of Matter] the light playing about
itself which is generated from its own nature.

<P>Of course we do not pretend that the sun's light [as the analogy
might imply] remains a self-gathered and sun-centred thing: it is at
once outrushing and indwelling; it strikes outward continuously, lap
after lap, until it reaches us upon our earth: we must take it that
all the light, including that which plays about the sun's orb, has
travelled; otherwise we would have a void expanse, that of the
space- which is material- next to the sun's orb. The Soul, on the
contrary- a light springing from the Divine Mind and shining 
about it-
is in closest touch with that source; it is not in transit 
but remains
centred there, and, in likeness to that principle, it has no place:
the light of the sun is actually in the air, but the soul is clean
of all such contact so that its immunity is patent to itself and to
any other of the same order.

<P>And by its own characteristic act, though not without reasoning
process, it knows the nature of the Intellectual-Principle which, on
its side, knows itself without need of reasoning, for it is ever
self-present whereas we become so by directing our soul towards it;
our life is broken and there are many lives, but that principle
needs no changings of life or of things; the lives it brings to
being are for others not for itself: it cannot need the inferior;
nor does it for itself produce the less when it possesses or is the
all, nor the images when it possesses or is the prototype.

<P>Anyone not of the strength to lay hold of the first soul, that
possessing pure intellection, must grasp that which has to 
do with our
ordinary thinking and thence ascend: if even this prove too hard,
let him turn to account the sensitive phase which carries the ideal
forms of the less fine degree, that phase which, too, with 
its powers,
is immaterial and lies just within the realm of Ideal-principles.

<P>One may even, if it seem necessary, begin as low as the
reproductive soul and its very production and thence make the
ascent, mounting from those ultimate ideal principles to the 
ultimates
in the higher sense, that is to the primals.
