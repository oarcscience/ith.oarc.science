<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 7</H4>

<P>7. Consider the universe: we are agreed that its 
existence and its
nature come to it from beyond itself; are we, now, to 
imagine that its
maker first thought it out in detail- the earth, and its necessary
situation in the middle; water and, again, its position as lying
upon the earth; all the other elements and objects up to the sky in
due place and order; living beings with their appropriate forms as
we know them, their inner organs and their outer limbs- and that
having thus appointed every item beforehand, he then set about the
execution?

<P>Such designing was not even possible; how could the plan for a
universe come to one that had never looked outward? Nor could he
work on material gathered from elsewhere as our craftsmen do, using
hands and tools; feet and hands are of the later order.

<P>One way, only, remains: all things must exist in something else;
of that prior- since there is no obstacle, all being 
continuous within
the realm of reality- there has suddenly appeared a sign, an image,
whether given forth directly or through the ministry of soul or of
some phase of soul, matters nothing for the moment: thus the entire
aggregate of existence springs from the divine world, in greater
beauty There because There unmingled but mingled here.

<P>From the beginning to end all is gripped by the Forms of the
Intellectual Realm: Matter itself is held by the Ideas of 
the elements
and to these Ideas are added other Ideas and others again, so that
it is hard to work down to crude Matter beneath all that sheathing
of Idea. Indeed since Matter itself is in its degree, an Idea- the
lowest- all this universe is Idea and there is nothing that is not
Idea as the archetype was. And all is made silently, since 
nothing had
part in the making but Being and Idea further reason why 
creation went
without toil. The Exemplar was the Idea of an All, and so an All
must come into being.

<P>Thus nothing stood in the way of the Idea, and even now it
dominates, despite all the clash of things: the creation is not
hindered on its way even now; it stands firm in virtue of being All.
To me, moreover, it seems that if we ourselves were 
archetypes, Ideas,
veritable Being, and the Idea with which we construct here were our
veritable Essence, then our creative power too would 
toillessly effect
its purpose: as man now stands, he does not produce in his 
work a true
image of himself: become man, he has ceased to be the All: ceasing
to be man- we read- "he soars aloft and administers the Kosmos
entire"; restored to the All he is maker of the All.

<P>But- to our immediate purpose- it is possible to give a 
reason why
the earth is set in the midst and why it is round and why 
the ecliptic
runs precisely as it does, but, looking to the creating principle,
we cannot say that because this was the way therefore things were so
planned: we can say only that because the All is what it is, 
therefore
there is a total of good; the causing principle, we might put it,
reached the conclusion before all formal reasoning and not from any
premises, not by sequence or plan but before either, since 
all of that
order is later, all reason, demonstration, persuasion.

<P>Since there is a Source, all the created must spring from it and
in accordance with it; and we are rightly told not to go seeking the
causes impelling a Source to produce, especially when this is the
perfectly sufficient Source and identical with the Term: a Source
which is Source and Term must be the All-Unity, complete in itself.
