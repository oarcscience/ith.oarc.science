<P>3. Is it a question of part in the sense that, taking one living
being, the soul in a finger might be called a part of the 
soul entire?

<P>This would carry the alternative that either there is no soul
outside of body, or that- no soul being within body- the thing
described as the soul of the universe is, none the less, outside the
body of the universe. That is a point to be investigated, but for
the present we must consider what kind of soul this parallel would
give us.

<P>If the particular soul is a part of the All-Soul only in 
the sense
that this bestows itself upon all living things of the 
partial sphere,
such a self-bestowal does not imply division; on the contrary, it is
the identical soul that is present everywhere, the one 
complete thing,
multi-present at the one moment: there is no longer question 
of a soul
that is a part against a soul that is an all- especially where an
identical power is present. Even difference of function, as in eyes
and ears, cannot warrant the assertion of distinct parts concerned
in each separate act- with other parts again making allotment of
faculty- all is met by the notion of one identical thing, but a
thing in which a distinct power operates in each separate function.
All the powers are present either in seeing or in hearing; the
difference in impression received is due to the difference in the
organs concerned; all the varying impressions are our various
responses to Ideal-forms that can be taken in a variety of modes.

<P>A further proof [of the unity of Soul] is that perception
demands a common gathering place; every organ has its distinct
function, and is competent only upon its own material, and must
interpret each several experience in its own fashion; the judgement
upon these impressions must, then, be vested in some one principle,
a judge informed upon all that is said and done.

<P>But again: "Everywhere, Unity": in the variety of functions if
each "part of the soul" were as distinct as are the entrant
sensations, none of those parts could have knowledge; awareness
would belong only to that judging faculty- or, if local, every such
act of awareness would stand quite unrelated to any other. But since
the soul is a rational soul, by the very same title by which it is
an All-Soul, and is called the rational soul, in the sense of being
a whole [and so not merely "reasoning locally"], then what is
thought of as a part must in reality be no part but the 
identity of an
unparted thing.
