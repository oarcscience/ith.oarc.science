<P>11. And we must remember that what comes from the supernals does
not enter into the recipients as it left the source; fire, for
instance, will be duller; the loving instinct will degenerate and
issue in ugly forms of the passion; the vital energy in a subject
not so balanced as to display the mean of manly courage, 
will come out
as either ferocity or faint-heartedness; and ambition... in love...;
and the instinct towards good sets up the pursuit of semblant
beauty; intellectual power at its lowest produces the extreme of
wickedness, for wickedness is a miscalculating effort towards
Intelligence.

<P>Any such quality, modified at best from its supreme form,
deteriorates again within itself: things of any kind that approach
from above, altered by merely leaving their source change further
still by their blending with bodies, with Matter, with each other.
