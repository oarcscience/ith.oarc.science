<P>4. If man were all of one piece- I mean, if he were nothing more
than a made thing, acting and acted upon according to a fixed
nature- he could be no more subject to reproach and punishment than
the mere animals. But as the scheme holds, man is singled out for
condemnation when he does evil; and this with justice. For he is no
mere thing made to rigid plan; his nature contains a Principle apart
and free.

<P>This does not, however, stand outside of Providence or of the
Reason of the All; the Over-World cannot be dependent upon the World
of Sense. The higher shines down upon the lower, and this 
illumination
is Providence in its highest aspect: The Reason-Principle has two
phases, one which creates the things of process and another which
links them with the higher beings: these higher beings constitute
the over-providence on which depends that lower providence which is
the secondary Reason-Principle inseparably united with its 
primal: the
two- the Major and Minor Providence- acting together produce the
universal woof, the one all-comprehensive Providence.

<P>Men possess, then, a distinctive Principle: but not all men turn
to account all that is in their Nature; there are men that 
live by one
Principle and men that live by another or, rather, by several
others, the least noble. For all these Principles are present even
when not acting upon the man- though we cannot think of them as
lying idle; everything performs its function.

<P>"But," it will be said, "what reason can there be for their not
acting upon the man once they are present; inaction must mean
absence?"

<P>We maintain their presence always, nothing void of them.

<P>But surely not where they exercise no action? If they
necessarily reside in all men, surely they must be operative in all-
this Principle of free action, especially.

<P>First of all, this free Principle is not an absolute 
possession of
the animal Kinds and is not even an absolute possession to all men.

<P>So this Principle is not the only effective force in all men?

<P>There is no reason why it should not be. There are men in whom
it alone acts, giving its character to the life while all else is
but Necessity [and therefore outside of blame].

<P>For [in the case of an evil life] whether it is that the
constitution of the man is such as to drive him down the troubled
paths or whether [the fault is mental or spiritual in that] the
desires have gained control, we are compelled to attribute the guilt
to the substratum [something inferior to the highest principle in
Man]. We would be naturally inclined to say that this substratum
[the responsible source of evil] must be Matter and not, as our
argument implies, the Reason-Principle; it would appear that not the
Reason-Principle but Matter were the dominant, crude Matter at the
extreme and then Matter as shaped in the realized man: but we must
remember that to this free Principle in man [which is a phase of the
All Soul] the Substratum [the direct inferior to be moulded] is [not
Matter but] the Reason-Principle itself with whatever that produces
and moulds to its own form, so that neither crude Matter nor Matter
organized in our human total is sovereign within us.

<P>The quality now manifested may be probably referred to 
the conduct
of a former life; we may suppose that previous actions have made the
Reason-Principle now governing within us inferior in radiance to
that which ruled before; the Soul which later will shine out again
is for the present at a feebler power.

<P>And any Reason-Principle may be said to include within itself
the Reason-Principle of Matter which therefore it is able to 
elaborate
to its own purposes, either finding it consonant with itself or
bestowing upon it the quality which makes it so. The
Reason-Principle of an ox does not occur except in 
connection with the
Matter appropriate to the ox-Kind. It must be by such a process that
the transmigration, of which we read takes place; the Soul must lose
its nature, the Reason-Principle be transformed; thus there comes
the ox-soul which once was Man.

<P>The degradation, then, is just.

<P>Still, how did the inferior Principle ever come into being, and
how does the higher fall to it?

<P>Once more- not all things are Firsts; there are Secondaries and
Tertiaries, of a nature inferior to that of their Priors; 
and a slight
tilt is enough to determine the departure from the straight course.
Further, the linking of any one being with any other amounts to a
blending such as to produce a distinct entity, a compound of the
two; it is not that the greater and prior suffers any diminution of
its own nature; the lesser and secondary is such from its very
beginning; it is in its own nature the lesser thing it 
becomes, and if
it suffers the consequences, such suffering is merited: all our
reasonings on these questions must take account of previous living
as the source from which the present takes its rise.
