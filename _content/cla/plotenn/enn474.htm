<P>1. We have to examine the question whether there exists an ideal
archetype of individuals, in other words whether I and every other
human being go back to the Intellectual, every [living] thing having
origin and principle There.

<P>If Socrates, Socrates' soul, is external then the Authentic
Socrates- to adapt the term- must be There; that is to say, the
individual soul has an existence in the Supreme as well as in this
world. If there is no such permanent endurance and what was Socrates
may with change of time become another soul and be Pythagoras or
someone else- then the individual Socrates has not that existence in
the Divine.

<P>But if the Soul of the individual contains the Reason-Principles
of all that it traverses, once more all men have their [archetypic]
existence There: and it is our doctrine that every soul contains all
the Reason-Principles that exist in the Kosmos: since then the
Kosmos contains the Reason-Principles not merely of man, but also of
all individual living things, so must the Soul. Its content of
Reason-Principles, then, must be limitless, unless there be a
periodical renovation bounding the boundlessness by the return of a
former series.

<P>But if [in virtue of this periodic return] each archetype may be
reproduced by numerous existents, what need is there that there be
distinct Reason-Principles and archetypes for each existent 
in any one
period? Might not one [archetypal] man suffice for all, and
similarly a limited number of souls produce a limitless 
number of men?

<P>No: one Reason-Principle cannot account for distinct and 
differing
individuals: one human being does not suffice as the 
exemplar for many
distinct each from the other not merely in material constituents but
by innumerable variations of ideal type: this is no question of
various pictures or images reproducing an original Socrates; the
beings produced differ so greatly as to demand distinct
Reason-Principles. The entire soul-period conveys with it all the
requisite Reason-Principles, and so too the same existents 
appear once
more under their action.

<P>There is no need to baulk at this limitlessness in the
Intellectual; it is an infinitude having nothing to do with number
or part; what we may think of it as its outgoing is no other than
its characteristic Act.
