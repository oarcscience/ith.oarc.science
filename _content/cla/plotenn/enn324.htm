<P>5. But this power which determines memory is it also the 
principle
by which the Supreme becomes effective in us?

<P>At any time when we have not been in direct vision of 
that sphere,
memory is the source of its activity within us; when we have 
possessed
that vision, its presence is due to the principle by which we
enjoyed it: this principle awakens where it wakens; and it alone has
vision in that order; for this is no matter to be brought to 
us by way
of analogy, or by the syllogistic reasoning whose grounds lie
elsewhere; the power which, even here, we possess of discoursing
upon the Intellectual Beings is vested, as we show, in that
principle which alone is capable of their contemplation. 
That, we must
awaken, so to speak, and thus attain the vision of the Supreme, as
one, standing on some lofty height and lifting his eyes, sees what
to those that have not mounted with him is invisible.

<P>Memory, by this account, commences after the soul has left the
higher spheres; it is first known in the celestial period.

<P>A soul that has descended from the Intellectual region to the
celestial and there comes to rest, may very well be understood to
recognize many other souls known in its former state supposing that,
as we have said, it retains recollection of much that it knew here.
This recognition would be natural if the bodies with which 
those souls
are vested in the celestial must reproduce the former appearance;
supposing the spherical form [of the stars inhabited by souls in the
mid-realm] means a change of appearance, recognition would go by
character, by the distinctive quality of personality: this is not
fantastic; conditions changing need not mean a change of 
character. If
the souls have mutual conversation, this too would mean recognition.

<P>But those whose descent from the Intellectual is complete, how
is it with them?

<P>They will recall their memories, of the same things, but 
with less
force than those still in the celestial, since they have had other
experiences to remember, and the lapse of time will have utterly
obliterated much of what was formerly present to them.

<P>But what way of remembering the Supreme is left if the souls
have turned to the sense-known kosmos, and are to fall into this
sphere of process?

<P>They need not fall to the ultimate depth: their downward
movement may be checked at some one moment of the way; and as long
as they have not touched the lowest of the region of process [the
point at which non-being begins] there is nothing to prevent them
rising once more.
