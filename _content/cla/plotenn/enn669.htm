<P>31. But since Thence come the beauty and light in all, it is
Thence that Intellectual-Principle took the brilliance of the
Intellectual Energy which flashed Nature into being; Thence soul
took power towards life, in virtue of that fuller life streaming
into it. Intellectual-Principle was raised thus to that Supreme and
remains with it, happy in that presence. Soul too, that soul which
as possessing knowledge and vision was capable, clung to what it
saw; and as its vision so its rapture; it saw and was stricken; but
having in itself something of that principle it felt its kinship and
was moved to longing like those stirred by the image of the 
beloved to
desire of the veritable presence. Lovers here mould themselves to
the beloved; they seek to increase their attraction of person and
their likeness of mind; they are unwilling to fall short in moral
quality or in other graces lest they be distasteful to those
possessing such merit- and only among such can true love be. In the
same way the soul loves the Supreme Good, from its very beginnings
stirred by it to love. The soul which has never strayed from 
this love
waits for no reminding from the beauty of our world: holding that
love- perhaps unawares- it is ever in quest, and, in its 
longing to be
borne Thither, passes over what is lovely here and with one glance
at the beauty of the universe dismisses all; for it sees that all is
put together of flesh and Matter, befouled by its housing, made
fragmentary by corporal extension, not the Authentic Beauty which
could never venture into the mud of body to be soiled, annulled.

<P>By only noting the flux of things it knows at once that from
elsewhere comes the beauty that floats upon them and so it is urged
Thither, passionate in pursuit of what it loves: never- 
unless someone
robs it of that love- never giving up till it attain.

<P>There indeed all it saw was beautiful and veritable; it grew in
strength by being thus filled with the life of the True; itself
becoming veritable Being and attaining veritable knowledge, it
enters by that neighbouring into conscious possession of what it has
long been seeking.
