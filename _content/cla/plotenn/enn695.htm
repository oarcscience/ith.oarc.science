<P>14. Another approach: Everything to which existence may be
attributed is either one with its essence or distinct from it. Thus
any given man is distinct from essential man though belonging to the
order Man: a soul and a soul's essence are the same- that is, in
case of soul pure and unmingled- Man as type is the same as man's
essence; where the thing, man, and the essence are different, the
particular man may be considered as accidental; but man, the
essence, cannot be so; the type, Man, has Real Being. Now if the
essence of man is real, not chanced or accidental, how can we think
That to be accidental which transcends the order man, author of the
type, source of all being, a principle more nearly simplex than
man's being or being of any kind? As we approach the 
simplex, accident
recedes; what is utterly simplex accident never touches at all.

<P>Further we must remember what has been already said, that where
there is true being, where things have been brought to 
reality by that
Principle- and this is true of whatsoever has determined condition
within the order of sense- all that reality is brought about 
in virtue
of something emanating from the divine. By things of determined
condition I mean such as contain, inbound with their essence, the
reason of their being as they are, so that, later, an observer can
state the use for each of the constituent parts- why the 
eye, why feet
of such and such a kind to such and such a being- and can recognise
that the reason for the production of each organ is inherent in that
particular being and that the parts exist for each other. Why feet
of a certain length? Because another member is as it is: because the
face is as it is, therefore the feet are what they are: in a word
the mutual determinant is mutual adaptation and the reason of each
of the several forms is that such is the plan of man.

<P>Thus the essence and its reason are one and the same. The
constituent parts arise from the one source not because that source
has so conceived each separately but because it has produced
simultaneously the plan of the thing and its existence. This 
therefore
is author at once of the existence of things and of their reasons,
both produced at the one stroke. It is in correspondence with the
things of process but far more nearly archetypal and authentic and
in a closer relation with the Better, their source, than they can be.

<P>Of things carrying their causes within, none arises at hazard or
without purpose; this "So it happened to be" is applicable to none.
All that they have comes from The Good; the Supreme itself, then, as
author of reason, of causation, and of causing essence- all
certainly lying far outside of chance- must be the Principle 
and as it
were the examplar of things, thus independent of hazard: it is, the
First, the Authentic, immune from chance, from blind effect and
happening: God is cause of Himself; for Himself and of Himself He is
what He is, the first self, transcendently The Self.
