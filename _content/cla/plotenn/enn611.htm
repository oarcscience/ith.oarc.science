<P>5. Often for the purpose of exposition- as a help towards
stating the nature of the produced multiplicity- we use the 
example of
many lines radiating from one centre; but, while we provide for
individualization, we must carefully preserve mutual 
presence. Even in
the case of our circle we need not think of separated radii; all may
be taken as forming one surface: where there is no distinction even
upon the one surface but all is power and reality undifferentiated,
all the beings may be thought of as centres uniting at one central
centre: we ignore the radial lines and think of their terminals at
that centre, where they are at one. Restore the radii; once more we
have lines, each touching a generating centre of its own, but that
centre remains coincident with the one first centre; the centres all
unite in that first centre and yet remain what they were, so 
that they
are as many as are the lines to which they serve as terminals; the
centres themselves appear as numerous as the lines starting from gem
and yet all those centres constitute a unity.

<P>Thus we may liken the Intellectual Beings in their diversity to
many centres coinciding with the one centre and themselves at one in
it but appearing multiple on account of the radial lines- lines
which do not generate the centres but merely lead to them. The
radii, thus, afford a serviceable illustration for the mode 
of contact
by which the Intellectual Unity manifests itself as multiple and
multipresent.
