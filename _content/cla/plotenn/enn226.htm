<P>6. What then, in sum, is to be thought of Love and of his
"birth" as we are told of it?

<P>Clearly we have to establish the significance, here, of Poverty
and Possession, and show in what way the parentage is appropriate:
we have also to bring these two into line with the other Supernals
since one spirit nature, one spirit essence, must characterize all
unless they are to have merely a name in common.

<P>We must, therefore, lay down the grounds on which we distinguish
the Gods from the Celestials- that is, when we emphasize the
separate nature of the two orders and are not, as often in practice,
including these Spirits under the common name of Gods.

<P>It is our teaching and conviction that the Gods are immune to
all passion while we attribute experience and emotion to the
Celestials which, though eternal Beings and directly next to 
the Gods,
are already a step towards ourselves and stand between the divine
and the human.

<P>But by what process was the immunity lost? What in their nature
led them downwards to the inferior?

<P>And other questions present themselves.

<P>Does the Intellectual Realm include no member of this spirit
order, not even one? And does the Kosmos contain only these spirits,
God being confined to the Intellectual? Or are there Gods in the
sub-celestial too, the Kosmos itself being a God, the third, as is
commonly said, and the Powers down to the Moon being all 
Gods as well?

<P>It is best not to use the word "Celestial" of any Being of that
Realm; the word "God" may be applied to the Essential-Celestial- the
autodaimon- and even to the Visible Powers of the Universe of Sense
down to the Moon; Gods, these too, visible, secondary, sequent upon
the Gods of the Intellectual Realm, consonant with Them, held about
Them, as the radiance about the star.

<P>What, then, are these spirits?

<P>A Celestial is the representative generated by each Soul when it
enters the Kosmos.

<P>And why, by a Soul entering the Kosmos?

<P>Because Soul pure of the Kosmos generates not a Celestial Spirit
but a God; hence it is that we have spoken of Love, offspring of
Aphrodite the Pure Soul, as a God.

<P>But, first what prevents every one of the Celestials 
from being an
Eros, a Love? And why are they not untouched by Matter like the Gods?

<P>On the first question: Every Celestial born in the 
striving of the
Soul towards the good and beautiful is an Eros; and all the Souls
within the Kosmos do engender this Celestial; but other 
Spirit-Beings,
equally born from the Soul of the All, but by other faculties of
that Soul, have other functions: they are for the direct service of
the All, and administer particular things to the purpose of the
Universe entire. The Soul of the All must be adequate to all that is
and therefore must bring into being spirit powers serviceable not
merely in one function but to its entire charge.

<P>But what participation can the Celestials have in Matter, and in
what Matter?

<P>Certainly none in bodily Matter; that would make them simply
living things of the order of sense. And if, even, they are to
invest themselves in bodies of air or of fire, the nature must have
already been altered before they could have any contact with the
corporeal. The Pure does not mix, unmediated, with body- though many
think that the Celestial-Kind, of its very essence, comports a body
aerial or of fire.

<P>But why should one order of Celestial descend to body and
another not? The difference implies the existence of some cause or
medium working upon such as thus descend. What would 
constitute such a
medium?

<P>We are forced to assume that there is a Matter of the 
Intellectual
Order, and that Beings partaking of it are thereby enabled to enter
into the lower Matter, the corporeal.
