<P>7. This is the significance of Plato's account of the birth of
Love.

<P>The drunkenness of the father Poros or Possession is caused by
Nectar, "wine yet not existing"; Love is born before the realm of
sense has come into being: Penia had participation in the 
Intellectual
before the lower image of that divine Realm had appeared; 
she dwelt in
that Sphere, but as a mingled being consisting partly of Form but
partly also of that indetermination which belongs to the Soul before
she attains the Good and when all her knowledge of Reality is a
fore-intimation veiled by the indeterminate and unordered: in this
state Poverty brings forth the Hypostasis, Love.

<P>This, then, is a union of Reason with something that is 
not Reason
but a mere indeterminate striving in a being not yet illuminated:
the offspring Love, therefore, is not perfect, not self-sufficient,
but unfinished, bearing the signs of its parentage, the undirected
striving and the self-sufficient Reason. This offspring is a
Reason-Principle but not purely so; for it includes within itself an
aspiration ill-defined, unreasoned, unlimited- it can never be sated
as long as it contains within itself that element of the
Indeterminate. Love, then, clings to the Soul, from which it 
sprung as
from the principle of its Being, but it is lessened by including an
element of the Reason-Principle which did not remain 
self-concentrated
but blended with the indeterminate, not, it is true, by immediate
contact but through its emanation. Love, therefore, is like 
a goad; it
is without resource in itself; even winning its end, it is 
poor again.

<P>It cannot be satisfied because a thing of mixture never 
can be so:
true satisfaction is only for what has its plenitude in its 
own being;
where craving is due to an inborn deficiency, there may be
satisfaction at some given moment but it does not last. Love, then,
has on the one side the powerlessness of its native 
inadequacy, on the
other the resource inherited from the Reason-Kind.

<P>Such must be the nature and such the origin of the entire Spirit
Order, each- like its fellow, Love- has its appointed sphere, is
powerful there, and wholly devoted to it, and, like Love, 
none is ever
complete of itself but always straining towards some good which it
sees in things of the partial sphere.

<P>We understand, now, why good men have no other Love other Eros
of life- than that for the Absolute and Authentic Good, and never
follow the random attractions known to those ranged under the lower
Spirit Kind.

<P>Each human being is set under his own Spirit-Guides, but this is
mere blank possession when they ignore their own and live by some
other spirit adopted by them as more closely attuned to the
operative part of the Soul in them. Those that go after evil are
natures that have merged all the Love-Principles within them in the
evil desires springing in their hearts and allowed the right reason,
which belongs to our kind, to fall under the spell of false 
ideas from
another source.

<P>All the natural Loves, all that serve the ends of Nature, are
good; in a lesser Soul, inferior in rank and in scope; in the
greater Soul, superior; but all belong to the order of Being. Those
forms of Love that do not serve the purposes of Nature are merely
accidents attending on perversion: in no sense are they 
Real-Beings or
even manifestations of any Reality; for they are no true issue of
Soul; they are merely accompaniments of a spiritual flaw which the
Soul automatically exhibits in the total of disposition and conduct.

<P>In a word; all that is truly good in a Soul acting to 
the purposes
of nature and within its appointed order, all this is Real-Being:
anything else is alien, no act of the Soul, but merely something
that happens to it: a parallel may be found in false mentation,
notions behind which there is no reality as there is in the case of
authentic ideas, the eternal, the strictly defined, in which there
is at once an act of true knowing, a truly knowable object and
authentic existence- and this not merely in the Absolute, but also
in the particular being that is occupied by the 
authentically knowable
and by the Intellectual-Principle manifest in every several form.

<P>In each particular human being we must admit the existence of
the authentic Intellective Act and of the authentically knowable
object- though not as wholly merged into our being, since we are not
these in the absolute and not exclusively these- and hence 
our longing
for absolute things: it is the expression of our intellective
activities: if we sometimes care for the partial, that affection is
not direct but accidental, like our knowledge that a given
triangular figure is made up of two right angles because the
absolute triangle is so.
