<P>29. Are we, then, to refer memory to the perceptive 
faculty and so
make one principle of our nature the seat of both awareness and
remembrance?

<P>Now supposing the very Shade, as we were saying in the case of
Hercules, has memory, then the perceptive faculty is twofold.

<P>[(And if (on the same supposition) the faculty that remembers is
not the faculty that perceives, but some other thing, then the
remembering faculty is twofold.]

<P>And further if the perceptive faculty [= the memory] deals with
matters learned [as well as with matters of observation and feeling]
it will be the faculty for the processes of reason also: but 
these two
orders certainly require two separate faculties.

<P>Must we then suppose a common faculty of apprehension [one
covering both sense perceptions and ideas] and assign memory in both
orders to this?

<P>The solution might serve if there were one and the same 
percipient
for objects of sense and objects of the Intellectual-Kind; but if
these stand in definite duality, then, for all we can say or do, we
are left with two separate principles of memory; and, supposing each
of the two orders of soul to possess both principles, then we have
four.

<P>And, on general grounds, what compelling reason is there that
the principle by which we perceive should be the principle 
by which we
remember, that these two acts should be vested in the one 
faculty? Why
must the seat of our intellectual action be also the seat of our
remembrance of that action? The most powerful thought does not
always go with the readiest memory; people of equal 
perception are not
equally good at remembering; some are especially gifted in 
perception,
others, never swift to grasp, are strong to retain.

<P>But, once more, admitting two distinct principles, 
something quite
separate remembering what sense-perception has first known- 
still this
something must have felt what it is required to remember?

<P>No; we may well conceive that where there is to be memory of a
sense-perception, this perception becomes a mere 
presentment, and that
to this image-grasping power, a distinct thing, belongs the memory,
the retention of the object: for in this imaging faculty the
perception culminates; the impression passes away but the vision
remains present to the imagination.

<P>By the fact of harbouring the presentment of an object that has
disappeared, the imagination is, at once, a seat of memory: where
the persistence of the image is brief, the memory is poor; people of
powerful memory are those in whom the image-holding power is firmer,
not easily allowing the record to be jostled out of its grip.

<P>Remembrance, thus, is vested in the imaging faculty; and memory
deals with images. Its differing quality or degree from man 
to man, we
would explain by difference or similarity in the strength of the
individual powers, by conduct like or unlike, by bodily conditions
present or absent, producing change and disorder or not- a 
point this,
however, which need not detain us here.
