<P>19. Thus what we know as pleasure and pain may be 
identified: pain
is our perception of a body despoiled, deprived of the image of the
soul; pleasure our perception of the living frame in which the image
of the soul is brought back to harmonious bodily operation. The
painful experience takes place in that living frame; but the
perception of it belongs to the sensitive phase of the soul, 
which, as
neighbouring the living body, feels the change and makes it known to
the principle, the imaging faculty, into which the sensations
finally merge; then the body feels the pain, or at least the body is
affected: thus in an amputation, when the flesh is cut the cutting
is an event within the material mass; but the pain felt in that mass
is there felt because it is not a mass pure and simple, but a mass
under certain [non-material] conditions; it is to that modified
substance that the sting of the pain is present, and the 
soul feels it
by an adoption due to what we think of as proximity.

<P>And, itself unaffected, it feels the corporeal 
conditions at every
point of its being, and is thereby enabled to assign every condition
to the exact spot at which the wound or pain occurs. Being present
as a whole at every point of the body, if it were itself affected
the pain would take it at every point, and it would suffer as one
entire being, so that it could not know, or make known, the spot
affected; it could say only that at the place of its presence there
existed pain- and the place of its presence is the entire 
human being.
As things are, when the finger pains the man is in pain 
because one of
his members is in pain; we class him as suffering, from his finger
being painful, just as we class him as fair from his eyes being blue.

<P>But the pain itself is in the part affected unless we include in
the notion of pain the sensation following upon it, in which case we
are saying only that distress implies the perception of distress.
But [this does not mean that the soul is affected] we cannot
describe the perception itself as distress; it is the 
knowledge of the
distress and, being knowledge, is not itself affected, or it 
could not
know and convey a true message: a messenger, affected, overwhelmed
by the event, would either not convey the message or not convey it
faithfully.
