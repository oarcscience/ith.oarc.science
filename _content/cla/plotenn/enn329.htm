<P>10. The ordering principle is twofold; there is the principle
known to us as the Demiurge and there is the Soul of the 
All; we apply
the appellation "Zeus" sometimes to the Demiurge and sometimes to
the principle conducting the universe.

<P>When under the name of Zeus we are considering the Demiurge we
must leave out all notions of stage and progress, and recognize one
unchanging and timeless life.

<P>But the life in the kosmos, the life which carries the leading
principle of the universe, still needs elucidation; does it operate
without calculation, without searching into what ought to be done?

<P>Yes: for what must be stands shaped before the kosmos, and is
ordered without any setting in order: the ordered things are merely
the things that come to be; and the principle that brings them into
being is Order itself; this production is an act of a soul 
linked with
an unchangeably established wisdom whose reflection in that soul is
Order. It is an unchanging wisdom, and there can therefore be no
changing in the soul which mirrors it, not sometimes turned towards
it, and sometimes away from it- and in doubt because it has turned
away- but an unremitting soul performing an unvarying task.

<P>The leading principle of the universe is a unity- and one that
is sovereign without break, not sometimes dominant and sometimes
dominated. What source is there for any such multiplicity of leading
principles as might result in contest and hesitation? And this
governing unity must always desire the one thing: what could bring
it to wish now for this and now for that, to its own greater
perplexing? But observe: no perplexity need follow upon any
development of this soul essentially a unity. The All stands a
multiple thing no doubt, having parts, and parts dashing with parts,
but that does not imply that it need be in doubt as to its conduct:
that soul does not take its essence from its ultimates or from its
parts, but from the Primals; it has its source in the First and
thence, along an unhindered path, it flows into a total of things,
conferring grace, and, because it remains one same thing occupied in
one task, dominating. To suppose it pursuing one new object after
another is to raise the question whence that novelty comes 
into being;
the soul, besides, would be in doubt as to its action; its very
work, the kosmos, would be the less well done by reason of the
hesitancy which such calculations would entail.
