<P>12. Enough upon that side of the question. But how does the
perfection [goodness] of numbers, lifeless things, depend upon their
particular unity? Just as all other inanimates find their perfection
in their unity.

<P>If it should be objected that numbers are simply non-existent,
we should point out that our discussion is concerned [not with units
as such, but] with beings considered from the aspect of their unity.

<P>We may again be asked how the point- supposing its independent
existence granted- participates in perfection. If the point is
chosen as an inanimate object, the question applies to all such
objects: but perfection does exist in such things, for example in a
circle: the perfection of the circle will be perfection for 
the point;
it will aspire to this perfection and strive to attain it, as far as
it can, through the circle.

<P>But how are the five genera to be regarded? Do they form
particulars by being broken up into parts? No; the genus exists as a
whole in each of the things whose genus it is.

<P>But how, at that, can it remain a unity? The unity of a 
genus must
be considered as a whole-in-many.

<P>Does it exist then only in the things participating in it? No;
it has an independent existence of its own as well. But this will,
no doubt, become clearer as we proceed.
