<P>5. But how explain the permanence There, while the 
content of this
sphere- its elements and its living things alike- are passing?

<P>The reason is given by Plato: the celestial order is 
from God, the
living things of earth from the gods sprung from God; and it is law
that the offspring of God endures.

<P>In other words, the celestial soul- and our souls with 
it- springs
directly next from the Creator, while the animal life of 
this earth is
produced by an image which goes forth from that celestial 
soul and may
be said to flow downwards from it.

<P>A soul, then, of the minor degree- reproducing, indeed, that of
the Divine sphere but lacking in power inasmuch as it must exercise
its creative act upon inferior stuff in an inferior region- the
substances taken up into the fabric being of themselves repugnant to
duration; with such an origin the living things of this realm cannot
be of strength to last for ever; the material constituents are not
as firmly held and controlled as if they were ruled immediately by a
Principle of higher potency.

<P>The heavens, on the contrary, must have persistence as a whole,
and this entails the persistence of the parts, of the stars they
contain: we could not imagine that whole to endure with the parts in
flux- though, of course, we must distinguish things 
sub-celestial from
the heavens themselves whose region does not in fact extend so low
as to the moon.

<P>Our own case is different: physically we are formed by that
[inferior] soul, given forth [not directly from God but] from the
divine beings in the heavens and from the heavens 
themselves; it is by
way of that inferior soul that we are associated with the body
[which therefore will not be persistent]; for the higher soul which
constitutes the We is the principle not of our existence but of our
excellence or, if also of our existence, then only in the sense
that, when the body is already constituted, it enters, bringing with
it some effluence from the Divine Reason in support of the existence.
