<P>10. It will be objected, that if the Soul constitutes the We
[the personality] and We are subject to these states then the Soul
must be subject to them, and similarly that what We do must 
be done by
the Soul.

<P>But it has been observed that the Couplement, too- especially
before our emancipation- is a member of this total We, and in fact
what the body experiences we say We experience. This then covers two
distinct notions; sometimes it includes the brute-part, sometimes it
transcends the brute. The body is brute touched to life; the true
man is the other, going pure of the body, natively endowed with the
virtues which belong to the Intellectual-Activity, virtues whose
seat is the Separate Soul, the Soul which even in its dwelling here
may be kept apart. [This Soul constitutes the human being] 
for when it
has wholly withdrawn, that other Soul which is a radiation [or
emanation] from it withdraws also, drawn after it.

<P>Those virtues, on the other hand, which spring not from
contemplative wisdom but from custom or practical discipline 
belong to
the Couplement: to the Couplement, too, belong the vices; 
they are its
repugnances, desires, sympathies.

<P>And Friendship?

<P>This emotion belongs sometimes to the lower part, 
sometimes to the
interior man.
