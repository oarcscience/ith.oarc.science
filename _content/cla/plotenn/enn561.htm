<P>1. We have now explained our conception of Reality [True Being]
and considered how far it agrees with the teaching of Plato. We have
still to investigate the opposed principle [the principle of
Becoming].

<P>There is the possibility that the genera posited for the
Intellectual sphere will suffice for the lower also; possibly with
these genera others will be required; again, the two series 
may differ
entirely; or perhaps some of the sensible genera will be identical
with their intellectual prototypes, and others different- 
"identical,"
however, being understood to mean only analogous and in possession
of a common name, as our results will make dear.

<P>We must begin on these lines:

<P>The subject of our discussion is the Sensible realm: Sensible
Existence is entirely embraced by what we know as the Universe: our
duty, then, would seem to be clear enough- to take this Universe and
analyse its nature, classifying its constituent parts and arranging
them by species. Suppose that we were making a division of speech:
we should reduce its infinity to finite terms, and from the identity
appearing in many instances evolve a unity, then another and
another, until we arrived at some definite number; each such unit we
should call a species if imposed upon individuals, a genus if
imposed upon species. Thus, every species of speech- and 
similarly all
phenomena- might be referred to a unity; speech- or element- might
be predicated of them all.

<P>This procedure however is as we have already shown, impossible
in dealing with the subject of our present enquiry. New 
genera must be
sought for this Universe-genera distinct from those of the
Intellectual, inasmuch as this realm is different from that, 
analogous
indeed but never identical, a mere image of the higher. True, it
involves the parallel existence of Body and Soul, for the Universe
is a living form: essentially however Soul is of the Intellectual
and does not enter into the structure of what is called Sensible
Being.

<P>Remembering this fact, we must- however great the difficulty-
exclude Soul from the present investigation, just as in a census of
citizens, taken in the interests of commerce and taxation, we should
ignore the alien population. As for the experiences to which Soul is
indirectly subject in its conjunction with Body and by reason of
Body's presence, their classification must be attempted at a later
stage, when we enquire into the details of Sensible Existence.
