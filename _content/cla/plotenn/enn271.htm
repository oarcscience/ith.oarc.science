<P>6. Action, thus, is set towards contemplation and an object of
contemplation, so that even those whose life is in doing have seeing
as their object; what they have not been able to achieve by 
the direct
path, they hope to come at by the circuit.

<P>Further: suppose they succeed; they desired a certain thing to
come about, not in order to be unaware of it but to know it, 
to see it
present before the mind: their success is the laying up of a vision.
We act for the sake of some good; this means not for something to
remain outside ourselves, not in order that we possess nothing but
that we may hold the good of the action. And hold it, where? 
Where but
in the mind?

<P>Thus once more, action is brought back to contemplation: 
for [mind
or] Soul is a Reason-Principle and anything that one lays up in the
Soul can be no other than a Reason-Principle, a silent 
thing, the more
certainly such a principle as the impression made is the deeper.

<P>This vision achieved, the acting instinct pauses; the mind is
satisfied and seeks nothing further; the contemplation, in one so
conditioned, remains absorbed within as having acquired certainty to
rest upon. The brighter the certainty, the more tranquil is the
contemplation as having acquired the more perfect unity; and- for
now we come to the serious treatment of the subject-

<P>In proportion to the truth with which the knowing faculty knows,
it comes to identification with the object of its knowledge.

<P>As long as duality persists, the two lie apart, parallel as it
were to each other; there is a pair in which the two elements remain
strange to one another, as when Ideal-Principles laid up in the mind
or Soul remain idle.

<P>Hence the Idea must not be left to lie outside but must be made
one identical thing with the soul of the novice so that he finds it
really his own.

<P>The Soul, once domiciled within that Idea and brought to
likeness with it, becomes productive, active; what it always held by
its primary nature it now grasps with knowledge and applies in deed,
so becoming, as it were, a new thing and, informed as it now 
is by the
purely intellectual, it sees [in its outgoing act] as a stranger
looking upon a strange world. It was, no doubt, essentially a
Reason-Principle, even an Intellectual Principle; but its function
is to see a [lower] realm which these do not see.

<P>For, it is a not a complete thing: it has a lack; it is 
incomplete
in regard to its Prior; yet it, also, has a tranquil vision 
of what it
produces. What it has once brought into being it produces no 
more, for
all its productiveness is determined by this lack: it 
produces for the
purpose of Contemplation, in the desire of knowing all its content:
when there is question of practical things it adapts its content to
the outside order.

<P>The Soul has a greater content than Nature has and 
therefore it is
more tranquil; it is more nearly complete and therefore more
contemplative. It is, however, not perfect, and is all the more
eager to penetrate the object of contemplation, and it seeks the
vision that comes by observation. It leaves its native realm and
busies itself elsewhere; then it returns, and it possesses its
vision by means of that phase of itself from which it had parted.
The self-indwelling Soul inclines less to such experiences.

<P>The Sage, then, is the man made over into a Reason-Principle: to
others he shows his act but in himself he is Vision: such a man is
already set, not merely in regard to exterior things but also within
himself, towards what is one and at rest: all his faculty 
and life are
inward-bent.
