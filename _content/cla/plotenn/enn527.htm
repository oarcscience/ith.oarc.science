<P>21. How, then, are we to recognise Passivity, since clearly it
is not to be found in the Act from outside which the 
recipient in turn
makes his own? Surely we must look for it in cases where the patient
remains without Act, the passivity pure.

<P>Imagine a case where an agent improves, though its Act tends
towards deterioration. Or, say, a a man's activity is guided by evil
and is allowed to dominate another's without restraint. In 
these cases
the Act is clearly wrong, the Passion blameless.

<P>What then is the real distinction between Action and Passion? Is
it that Action starts from within and is directed upon an outside
object, while Passion is derived from without and fulfilled within?
What, then, are we to say of such cases as thought and opinion which
originate within but are not directed outwards? Again, the Passion
"being heated" rises within the self, when that self is 
provoked by an
opinion to reflection or to anger, without the intervention of any
external. Still it remains true that Action, whether self-centred or
with external tendency, is a motion rising in the self.

<P>How then do we explain desire and other forms of aspiration?
Aspiration must be a motion having its origin in the object aspired
to, though some might disallow "origin" and be content with saying
that the motion aroused is subsequent to the object; in what
respect, then, does aspiring differ from taking a blow or being
borne down by a thrust?

<P>Perhaps, however, we should divide aspirations into two classes,
those which follow intellect being described as Actions, the merely
impulsive being Passions. Passivity now will not turn on origin,
without or within- within there can only be deficiency; but 
whenever a
thing, without itself assisting in the process, undergoes an
alteration not directed to the creation of Being but changing the
thing for the worse or not for the better, such an alteration will
be regarded as a Passion and as entailing passivity.

<P>If however "being heated" means "acquiring heat," and is 
sometimes
found to contribute to the production of Being and sometimes not,
passivity will be identical with impassivity: besides, "being
heated" must then have a double significance [according as it does
or does not contribute to Being].

<P>The fact is, however, that "being heated," even when it
contributes to Being, involves the presence of a patient [distinct
from the being produced]. Take the case of the bronze which has to
be heated and so is a patient; the being is a statue, which is not
heated except accidentally [by the accident of being contained in
the bronze]. If then the bronze becomes more beautiful as a result
of being heated and in the same proportion, it certainly 
becomes so by
passivity; for passivity must, clearly, take two forms: there is the
passivity which tends to alteration for better or for worse, 
and there
is the passivity which has neither tendency.
