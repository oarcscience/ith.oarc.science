<P>6. And, what are we to think of the new forms of being they
introduce- their "Exiles" and "Impressions" and "Repentings"?

<P>If all comes to states of the Soul- "Repentance" when it has
undergone a change of purpose; "Impressions" when it contemplates
not the Authentic Existences but their simulacra- there is nothing
here but a jargon invented to make a case for their school: all this
terminology is piled up only to conceal their debt to the ancient
Greek philosophy which taught, clearly and without bombast, 
the ascent
from the cave and the gradual advance of souls to a truer and truer
vision.

<P>For, in sum, a part of their doctrine comes from Plato; all the
novelties through which they seek to establish a philosophy of their
own have been picked up outside of the truth.

<P>From Plato come their punishments, their rivers of the
underworld and the changing from body to body; as for the plurality
they assert in the Intellectual Realm- the Authentic Existent, the
Intellectual-Principle, the Second Creator and the Soul- all this is
taken over from the Timaeus, where we read:

<P>"As many Ideal-Forms as the Divine Mind beheld dwelling 
within the
Veritably Living Being, so many the Maker resolved should be 
contained
in this All."

<P>Misunderstanding their text, they conceived one Mind passively
including within itself all that has being, another mind, a distinct
existence, having vision, and a third planning the Universe- though
often they substitute Soul for this planning Mind as the creating
Principle- and they think that this third being is the Creator
according to Plato.

<P>They are in fact quite outside of the truth in their
identification of the Creator.

<P>In every way they misrepresent Plato's theory as to the method
of creation as in many other respects they dishonour his teaching:
they, we are to understand, have penetrated the Intellectual Nature,
while Plato and all those other illustrious teachers have failed.

<P>They hope to get the credit of minute and exact identification
by setting up a plurality of intellectual Essences; but in reality
this multiplication lowers the Intellectual Nature to the 
level of the
Sense-Kind: their true course is to seek to reduce number to 
the least
possible in the Supreme, simply referring all things to the Second
Hypostasis- which is all that exists as it is Primal Intellect and
Reality and is the only thing that is good except only for the first
Nature- and to recognize Soul as the third Principle, accounting for
the difference among souls merely by diversity of experience and
character. Instead of insulting those venerable teachers they should
receive their doctrine with the respect due to the older thought and
honour all that noble system- an immortal soul, an Intellectual and
Intelligible Realm, the Supreme God, the Soul's need of emancipation
from all intercourse with the body, the fact of separation from it,
the escape from the world of process to the world of
essential-being. These doctrines, all emphatically asserted by
Plato, they do well to adopt: where they differ, they are at full
liberty to speak their minds, but not to procure assent for their
own theories by flaying and flouting the Greeks: where they have a
divergent theory to maintain they must establish it by its 
own merits,
declaring their own opinions with courtesy and with philosophical
method and stating the controverted opinion fairly; they must point
their minds towards the truth and not hunt fame by insult, reviling
and seeking in their own persons to replace men honoured by the fine
intelligences of ages past.

<P>As a matter of fact the ancient doctrine of the Divine Essences
was far the sounder and more instructed, and must be accepted by all
not caught in the delusions that beset humanity: it is easy also to
identify what has been conveyed in these later times from 
the ancients
with incongruous novelties- how for example, where they must set up
a contradictory doctrine, they introduce a medley of generation and
destruction, how they cavil at the Universe, how they make the Soul
blameable for the association with body, how they revile the
Administrator of this All, how they ascribe to the Creator, 
identified
with the Soul, the character and experiences appropriate to 
partial be
beings.
