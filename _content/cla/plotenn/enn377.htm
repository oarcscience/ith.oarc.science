<P>3. With this prologue we come to our discussion of Memory.

<P>That the soul, or mind, having taken no imprint, yet achieves
perception of what it in no way contains need not surprise us; or
rather, surprising though it is, we cannot refuse to believe in this
remarkable power.

<P>The Soul is the Reason-Principle of the universe, ultimate among
the Intellectual Beings- its own essential Nature is one of 
the Beings
of the Intellectual Realm- but it is the primal Reason-Principle of
the entire realm of sense.

<P>Thus it has dealings with both orders- benefited and quickened
by the one, but by the other beguiled, falling before resemblances,
and so led downwards as under spell. Poised midway, it is aware of
both spheres.

<P>Of the Intellectual it is said to have intuition by memory upon
approach, for it knows them by a certain natural identity with them;
its knowledge is not attained by besetting them, so to speak, but by
in a definite degree possessing them; they are its natural vision;
they are itself in a more radiant mode, and it rises from its duller
pitch to that greater brilliance in a sort of awakening, a progress
from its latency to its act.

<P>To the sense-order it stands in a similar nearness and to such
things it gives a radiance out of its own store and, as it were,
elaborates them to visibility: the power is always ripe and, so to
say, in travail towards them, so that, whenever it puts out its
strength in the direction of what has once been present in 
it, it sees
that object as present still; and the more intent its effort the
more durable is the presence. This is why, it is agreed, 
children have
long memory; the things presented to them are not constantly 
withdrawn
but remain in sight; in their case the attention is limited but not
scattered: those whose faculty and mental activity are busied upon a
multitude of subjects pass quickly over all, lingering on none.

<P>Now, if memory were a matter of seal-impressions retained, the
multiplicity of objects would have no weakening effect on the
memory. Further, on the same hypothesis, we would have no need of
thinking back to revive remembrance; nor would we be subject to
forgetting and recalling; all would lie engraved within.

<P>The very fact that we train ourselves to remember shows that
what we get by the process is a strengthening of the mind: just so,
exercises for feet and hands enable us to do easily acts which in no
sense contained or laid up in those members, but to which they may
be fitted by persevering effort.

<P>How else can it be explained that we forget a thing heard once
or twice but remember what is often repeated, and that we recall a
long time afterwards what at first hearing we failed to hold?

<P>It is no answer to say that the parts present themselves sooner
than the entire imprint- why should they too be forgotten?- [there
is no question of parts, for] the last hearing, or our effort to
remember, brings the thing back to us in a flash.

<P>All these considerations testify to an evocation of that faculty
of the soul, or mind, in which remembrance is vested: the mind is
strengthened, either generally or to this particular purpose.

<P>Observe these facts: memory follows upon attention; 
those who have
memorized much, by dint of their training in the use of leading
indications [suggestive words and the like], reach the point of
being easily able to retain without such aid: must we not conclude
that the basis of memory is the soul-power brought to full strength?

<P>The lingering imprints of the other explanation would tell of
weakness rather than power; for to take imprint easily is to be
yielding. An impression is something received passively; the 
strongest
memory, then, would go with the least active nature. But what
happens is the very reverse: in no pursuit to technical 
exercises tend
to make a man less the master of his acts and states. It is as with
sense-perception; the advantage is not to the weak, the weak eye for
example, but to that which has the fullest power towards its 
exercise.
In the old, it is significant, the senses are dulled and so is the
memory.

<P>Sensation and memory, then, are not passivity but power.

<P>And, once it is admitted that sensations are not impressions,
the memory of a sensation cannot consist in the retention of an
impression that was never made.

<P>Yes: but if it is an active power of the mind, a fitness towards
its particular purpose, why does it not come at once- and not with
delay- to the recollection of its unchanging objects?

<P>Simply because the power needs to be poised and prepared: in
this it is only like all the others, which have to be readied for
the task to which their power reaches, some operating very swiftly,
others only after a certain self-concentration.

<P>Quick memory does not in general go with quick wit: the 
two do not
fall under the same mental faculty; runner and boxer are not often
united in one person; the dominant idea differs from man to man.

<P>Yet there could be nothing to prevent men of superior 
faculty from
reading impressions on the mind; why should one thus gifted be
incapable of what would be no more than a passive taking and holding?

<P>That memory is a power of the Soul [not a capacity for taking
imprint] is established at a stroke by the consideration 
that the soul
is without magnitude.

<P>And- one general reflection- it is not extraordinary that
everything concerning soul should proceed in quite other ways than
appears to people who either have never enquired, or have hastily
adopted delusive analogies from the phenomena of sense, and 
persist in
thinking of perception and remembrance in terms of characters
inscribed on plates or tablets; the impossibilities that beset this
theory escape those that make the soul incorporeal equally with
those to whom it is corporeal.
