<P>7. We come to the same result by examining the sense of pain. We
say there is pain in the finger: the trouble is doubtless in the
finger, but our opponents must admit that the sensation of 
the pain is
in the centre of consciousness. The suffering member is one 
thing, the
sense of suffering is another: how does this happen?

<P>By transmission, they will say: the psychic pneuma [= the
semi-material principle of life] stationed at the finger suffers
first; and stage by stage the trouble is passed on until at last it
reaches the centre of consciousness.

<P>But on this theory, there must be a sensation in the spot first
suffering pain, and another sensation at a second point of 
the line of
transmission, another in the third and so on; many 
sensations, in fact
an unlimited series, to deal with one pain; and at the last 
moment the
centre of consciousness has the sensation of all these sensations
and of its own sensation to boot. Or to be exact, these serial
sensations will not be of the pain in the finger: the sensation next
in succession to the suffering finger will be of pain at the joint,
a third will tell of a pain still higher up: there will be a 
series of
separate pains: The centre of consciousness will not feel the pain
seated at the finger, but only that impinging upon itself: it will
know this alone, ignore the rest and so have no notion that 
the finger
is in pain.

<P>Thus: Transmission would not give sensation of the actual
condition at the affected spot: it is not in the nature of body that
where one part suffers there should be knowledge in another part;
for body is a magnitude, and the parts of every magnitude 
are distinct
parts; therefore we need, as the sentient, something of a 
nature to be
identical to itself at any and every spot; this property can belong
only to some other form of being than body.
