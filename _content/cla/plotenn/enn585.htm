<P>25. The nature of integration and disintegrations calls for
scrutiny. Are they different from the motions above mentioned, from
coming-to-be and passing-away, from growth and decay, from change of
place and from alteration? or must they be referred to these? or,
again, must some of these be regarded as types of integration and
disintegration?

<P>If integration implies that one element proceeds towards
another, implies in short an approach, and disintegration, on the
other hand, a retreat into the background, such motions may be
termed local; we have clearly a case of two things moving in the
direction of unity, or else making away from each other.

<P>If however the things achieve a sort of fusion, mixture, 
blending,
and if a unity comes into being, not when the process of combination
is already complete, but in the very act of combining, to 
which of our
specified motions shall we refer this type? There will certainly be
locomotion at first, but it will be succeeded by something
different; just as in growth locomotion is found at the 
outset, though
later it is supplanted by quantitative motion. The present case is
similar: locomotion leads the way, but integration or disintegration
does not inevitably follow; integration takes place only when the
impinging elements become intertwined, disintegration only when they
are rent asunder by the contact.

<P>On the other hand, it often happens that locomotion follows
disintegration, or else occurs simultaneously, though the experience
of the disintegrated is not conceived in terms of locomotion: so too
in integration a distinct experience, a distinct unification,
accompanies the locomotion and remains separate from it.

<P>Are we then to posit a new species for these two motions, adding
to them, perhaps, alteration? A thing is altered by becoming 
dense- in
other words, by integration; it is altered again by being rarefied-
that is, by disintegration. When wine and water are mixed, something
is produced different from either of the pre-existing elements:
thus, integration takes place, resulting in alteration.

<P>But perhaps we should recall a previous distinction, and while
holding that integrations and disintegrations precede alterations,
should maintain that alterations are nonetheless distinct 
from either;
that, further, not every alteration is of this type [presupposing,
that is to say, integration or disintegration], and, in particular,
rarefication and condensation are not identical with disintegration
and integration, nor in any sense derived from them: to suppose that
they were would involve the admission of a vacuum.

<P>Again, can we use integration and disintegration to explain
blackness and whiteness? But to doubt the independent existence of
these qualities means that, beginning with colours, we may end by
annihilating almost all qualities, or rather all without exception;
for if we identify every alteration, or qualitative change, with
integration and disintegration, we allow nothing whatever to 
come into
existence; the same elements persist, nearer or farther apart.

<P>Finally, how is it possible to class learning and being taught
as integrations?
