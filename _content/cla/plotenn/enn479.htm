<P>2. But let us leave the arts and consider those works produced
by Nature and admitted to be naturally beautiful which the creations
of art are charged with imitating, all reasoning life and
unreasoning things alike, but especially the consummate among them,
where the moulder and maker has subdued the material and given the
form he desired. Now what is the beauty here? It has nothing to do
with the blood or the menstrual process: either there is 
also a colour
and form apart from all this, or there is nothing unless sheer
ugliness or a bare recipient, as it were the mere Matter of beauty.

<P>Whence shone forth the beauty of Helen, battle-sought; or of all
those women like in loveliness to Aphrodite; or of Aphrodite
herself; or of any human being that has been perfect in beauty; or
of any of these gods manifest to sight, or unseen but carrying what
would be beauty if we saw?

<P>In all these is it not the Idea, something of that realm but
communicated to the produced from within the producer just 
as in works
of art, we held, it is communicated from the arts to their
creations? Now we can surely not believe that, while the made thing
and the Idea thus impressed upon Matter are beautiful, yet the Idea
not so alloyed but resting still with the creator- the Idea primal,
immaterial, firmly a unity- is not Beauty.

<P>If material extension were in itself the ground of beauty, then
the creating principle, being without extension, could not be
beautiful: but beauty cannot be made to depend upon magnitude since,
whether in a large object or a small, the one Idea equally moves and
forms the mind by its inherent power. A further indication is that
as long as the object remains outside us we know nothing of it; it
affects us by entry; but only as an Idea can it enter 
through the eyes
which are not of scope to take an extended mass: we are, no doubt,
simultaneously possessed of the magnitude which, however, we take in
not as mass but by an elaboration upon the presented form.

<P>Then again the principle producing the beauty must be, itself,
ugly, neutral or beautiful: ugly, it could not produce the opposite;
neutral, why should its product be the one rather than the other?
The Nature, then, which creates things so lovely must be itself of a
far earlier beauty; we, undisciplined in discernment of the inward,
knowing nothing of it, run after the outer, never understanding that
it is the inner which stirs us; we are in the case of one 
who sees his
own reflection but not realizing whence it comes goes in pursuit of
it.

<P>But that the thing we are pursuing is something 
different and that
the beauty is not in the concrete object is manifest from the beauty
there is in matters of study, in conduct and custom; briefly in soul
or mind. And it is precisely here that the greater beauty lies,
perceived whenever you look to the wisdom in a man and delight in
it, not wasting attention on the face, which may be hideous, but
passing all appearance by and catching only at the inner comeliness,
the truly personal; if you are still unmoved and cannot acknowledge
beauty under such conditions, then looking to your own inner 
being you
will find no beauty to delight you and it will be futile in 
that state
to seek the greater vision, for you will be questing it through the
ugly and impure.

<P>This is why such matters are not spoken of to everyone; you, if
you are conscious of beauty within, remember.
