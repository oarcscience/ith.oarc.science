<P>36. The Universe is immensely varied, the container of all the
Reason-Principles and of infinite and diverse efficacies. In man, we
are told, the eye has its power, and the bones have their varied
powers, and so with each separate part of hand and of foot; and
there is no member or organ without its own definite function, some
separate power of its own- a diversity of which we can have no
notion unless our studies take that direction. What is true of man
must be true of the universe, and much more, since all this order is
but a representation of the higher: it must contain an untellably
wonderful variety of powers, with which, of course, the bodies
moving through the heavens will be most richly endowed.

<P>We cannot think of the universe as a soulless habitation,
however vast and varied, a thing of materials easily told 
off, kind by
kind- wood and stone and whatever else there be, all blending into a
kosmos: it must be alert throughout, every member living by its own
life, nothing that can have existence failing to exist within it.

<P>And here we have the solution of the problem, "How an ensouled
living form can include the soulless": for this account allows
grades of living within the whole, grades to some of which we deny
life only because they are not perceptibly self-moved: in the truth,
all of these have a hidden life; and the thing whose life is 
patent to
sense is made up of things which do not live to sense, but, none the
less, confer upon their resultant total wonderful powers towards
living. Man would never have reached to his actual height if the
powers by which he acts were the completely soulless elements of his
being; similarly the All could not have its huge life unless 
its every
member had a life of its own; this however does not necessarily
imply a deliberate intention; the All has no need of intention to
bring about its acts: it is older than intention, and therefore its
powers have many servitors.
