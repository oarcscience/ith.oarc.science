<P>22. And as regards vegetal forms? Are we to imagine beneath the
leading principle [the "Nature" phase] some sort of corporeal echo
of it, something that would be tendency or desire in us and is
growth in them? Or are we to think that, while the earth [which
nourishes them] contains the principle of desire by virtue of
containing soul, the vegetal realm possesses only this latter
reflection of desire?

<P>The first point to be decided is what soul is present in the
earth.

<P>Is it one coming from the sphere of the All, a radiation upon
earth from that which Plato seems to represent as the only thing
possessing soul primarily? Or are we to go by that other 
passage where
he describes earth as the first and oldest of all the gods within
the scope of the heavens, and assigns to it, as to the other stars,
a soul peculiar to itself?

<P>It is difficult to see how earth could be a god if it did not
possess a soul thus distinct: but the whole matter is obscure since
Plato's statements increase or at least do not lessen the
perplexity. It is best to begin by facing the question as a matter
of reasoned investigation.

<P>That earth possesses the vegetal soul may be taken as 
certain from
the vegetation upon it. But we see also that it produces animals;
why then should we not argue that it is itself animated? And,
animated, no small part of the All, must it not be plausible 
to assert
that it possesses an Intellectual-Principle by which it 
holds its rank
as a god? If this is true of every one of the stars, why 
should it not
be so of the earth, a living part of the living All? We cannot think
of it as sustained from without by an alien soul and incapable of
containing one appropriate to itself.

<P>Why should those fiery globes be receptive of soul, and the
earthly globe not? The stars are equally corporeal, and they lack
the flesh, blood, muscle, and pliant material of earth, which,
besides, is of more varied content and includes every form 
of body. If
the earth's immobility is urged in objection, the answer is that
this refers only to spatial movement.

<P>But how can perception and sensation [implied in ensoulment] be
supposed to occur in the earth?

<P>How do they occur in the stars? Feeling does not belong to
fleshy matter: soul to have perception does not require 
body; body, on
the contrary, requires soul to maintain its being and its
efficiency, judgement [the foundation of perception] belongs to the
soul which overlooks the body, and, from what is experienced there,
forms its decisions.

<P>But, we will be asked to say what are the experiences, within
the earth, upon which the earth-soul is thus to form its decisions:
certainly vegetal forms, in so far as they belong to earth have no
sensation or perception: in what then, and through what, does such
sensation take place, for sensation without organs is too rash a
notion. Besides, what would this sense-perception profit the soul?
It could not be necessary to knowledge: surely the consciousness of
wisdom suffices to beings which have nothing to gain from sensation?

<P>This argument is not to be accepted: it ignores the
consideration that, apart from all question of practical utility,
objects of sense provide occasion for a knowing which brings 
pleasure:
thus we ourselves take delight in looking upon sun, stars, sky,
landscape, for their own sake. But we will deal with this 
point later:
for the present we ask whether the earth has perceptions and
sensations, and if so through what vital members these would take
place and by what method: this requires us to examine certain
difficulties, and above all to decide whether earth could have
sensation without organs, and whether this would be directed to some
necessary purpose even when incidentally it might bring other
results as well.
