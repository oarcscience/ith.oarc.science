<P>40. But magic spells; how can their efficacy be explained?

<P>By the reigning sympathy and by the fact in Nature that there is
an agreement of like forces and an opposition of unlike, and by the
diversity of those multitudinous powers which converge in the one
living universe.

<P>There is much drawing and spell-binding dependent on no
interfering machination; the true magic is internal to the All, its
attractions and, not less, its repulsions. Here is the primal mage
and sorcerer- discovered by men who thenceforth turn those same
ensorcellations and magic arts upon one another.

<P>Love is given in Nature; the qualities inducing love 
induce mutual
approach: hence there has arisen an art of magic love-drawing whose
practitioners, by the force of contact implant in others a new
temperament, one favouring union as being informed with love; they
knit soul to soul as they might train two separate trees towards
each other. The magician too draws on these patterns of power, and
by ranging himself also into the pattern is able tranquilly 
to possess
himself of these forces with whose nature and purpose he has become
identified. Supposing the mage to stand outside the All, his
evocations and invocations would no longer avail to draw up 
or to call
down; but as things are he operates from no outside standground, he
pulls knowing the pull of everything towards any other thing in the
living system.

<P>The tune of an incantation, a significant cry, the mien of the
operator, these too have a natural leading power over the soul upon
which they are directed, drawing it with the force of mournful
patterns or tragic sounds- for it is the reasonless soul, 
not the will
or wisdom, that is beguiled by music, a form of sorcery which raises
no question, whose enchantment, indeed, is welcomed, 
exacted, from the
performers. Similarly with regard to prayers; there is no question
of a will that grants; the powers that answer to incantations do not
act by will; a human being fascinated by a snake has neither
perception nor sensation of what is happening; he knows only after
he has been caught, and his highest mind is never caught. In other
words, some influence falls from the being addressed upon the
petitioner- or upon someone else- but that being itself, sun or
star, perceives nothing of it all.
