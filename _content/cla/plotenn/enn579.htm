<P>19. With Quality we have undertaken to group the 
dependent qualia,
in so far as Quality is bound up with them; we shall not however
introduce into this category the qualified objects [qua 
objects], that
we may not be dealing with two categories at once; we shall pass
over the objects to that which gives them their [specific] name.

<P>But how are we to classify such terms as "not white"? If "not
white" signifies some other colour, it is a quality. But if it is
merely a negation of an enumeration of things not white, it will be
either a meaningless sound, or else a name or definition of
something actual: if a sound, it is a kind of motion; if a name or
definition, it is a relative, inasmuch as names and definitions are
significant. But if not only the things enumerated are in some one
genus, but also the propositions and terms in question must 
be each of
them significative of some genus, then we shall assert that negative
propositions and terms posit certain things within a restricted
field and deny others. Perhaps, however, it would be better, in view
of their composite nature, not to include the negations in the same
genus as the affirmations.

<P>What view, then, shall we take of privations? If they are
privations of qualities, they will themselves be qualities:
"toothless" and "blind," for example, are qualities. "Naked" and
"dothed," on the other hand, are neither of them qualities 
but states:
they therefore comport a relation to something else.

<P>[With regard to passive qualities:]

<P>Passivity, while it lasts, is not a quality but a motion; when
it is a past experience remaining in one's possession, it is a
quality; if one ceases to possess the experience then regarded as a
finished occurrence, one is considered to have been moved- in other
words, to have been in Motion. But in none of these cases is it
necessary to conceive of anything but Motion; the idea of time
should be excluded; even present time has no right to be introduced.

<P>"Well" and similar adverbial expressions are to be 
referred to the
single generic notion [of Quality].

<P>It remains to consider whether blushing should be referred to
Quality, even though the person blushing is not included in this
category. The fact of becoming flushed is rightly not referred to
Quality; for it involves passivity- in short, Motion. But if one has
ceased to become flushed and is actually red, this is surely 
a case of
Quality, which is independent of time. How indeed are we to define
Quality but by the aspect which a substance presents? By predicating
of a man redness, we clearly ascribe to him a quality.

<P>We shall accordingly maintain that states alone, and not
dispositions, constitute qualities: thus, "hot" is a quality but not
"growing hot," "ill" but not "turning ill."
