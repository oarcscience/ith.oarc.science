<P>12. And how does this image set to its task immediately after it
comes into being?

<P>By memory of what it has seen?

<P>But it was utterly non-existent, it could have no vision, either
it or the Mother they bestow upon it.

<P>Another difficulty: These people come upon earth not as
Soul-Images but as veritable Souls; yet, by great stress and strain,
one or two of them are able to stir beyond the limits of the world,
and when they do attain Reminiscence barely carry with them some
slight recollection of the Sphere they once knew: on the other hand,
this Image, a new-comer into being, is able, they tell us- as also
is its Mother- to form at least some dim representation of the
celestial world. It is an Image, stamped in Matter, yet it not
merely has the conception of the Supreme and adopts from that world
the plan of this, but knows what elements serve the purpose. How,
for instance, did it come to make fire before anything else? 
What made
it judge fire a better first than some other object?

<P>Again, if it created the fire of the Universe by 
thinking of fire,
why did it not make the Universe at a stroke by thinking of the
Universe? It must have conceived the product complete from the
first; the constituent elements would be embraced in that general
conception.

<P>The creation must have been in all respects more according to
the way of Nature than to that of the arts- for the arts are of
later origin than Nature and the Universe, and even at the present
stage the partial things brought into being by the natural Kinds do
not follow any such order- first fire, then the several other
elements, then the various blends of these- on the contrary 
the living
organism entire is encompassed and rounded off within the uterine
germ. Why should not the material of the Universe be similarly
embraced in a Kosmic Type in which earth, fire and the rest would be
included? We can only suppose that these people themselves, acting
by their more authentic Soul, would have produced the world by such
a process, but that the Creator had not wit to do so.

<P>And yet to conceive the vast span of the Heavens- to be great in
that degree- to devise the obliquity of the Zodiac and the circling
path of all the celestial bodies beneath it, and this earth of ours-
and all in such a way that reason can be given for the plan- this
could never be the work of an Image; it tells of that Power [the
All-Soul] next to the very Highest Beings.

<P>Against their will, they themselves admit this: their
"outshining upon the darkness," if the doctrine is sifted, makes it
impossible to deny the true origins of the Kosmos.

<P>Why should this down-shining take place unless such a process
belonged to a universal law?

<P>Either the process is in the order of Nature or against that
order. If it is in the nature of things, it must have taken 
place from
eternity; if it is against the nature of things, then the breach of
natural right exists in the Supreme also; evil antedates this world;
the cause of evil is not the world; on the contrary the 
Supreme is the
evil to us; instead of the Soul's harm coming from this sphere, we
have this Sphere harmed by the Soul.

<P>In fine, the theory amounts to making the world one of the
Primals, and with it the Matter from which it emerges.

<P>The Soul that declined, they tell us, saw and illuminated the
already existent Darkness. Now whence came that Darkness?

<P>If they tell us that the Soul created the Darkness by 
its Decline,
then, obviously, there was nowhere for the Soul to decline to; the
cause of the decline was not the Darkness but the very nature of the
Soul. The theory, therefore, refers the entire process to 
pre-existing
compulsions: the guilt inheres in the Primal Beings.
