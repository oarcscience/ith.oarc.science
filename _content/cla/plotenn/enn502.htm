<P>11. Now as to the arts and crafts and their productions:

<P>The imitative arts- painting, sculpture, dancing, pantomimic
gesturing- are, largely, earth-based; on an earthly base; they
follow models found in sense, since they copy forms and movements
and reproduce seen symmetries; they cannot therefore be referred to
that higher sphere except indirectly, through the Reason-Principle
in humanity.

<P>On the other hand any skill which, beginning with the
observation of the symmetry of living things, grows to the 
symmetry of
all life, will be a portion of the Power There which observes and
meditates the symmetry reigning among all beings in the Intellectual
Kosmos. Thus all music- since its thought is upon melody and rhythm-
must be the earthly representation of the music there is in 
the rhythm
of the Ideal Realm.

<P>The crafts, such as building and carpentry which give us 
Matter in
wrought forms, may be said, in that they draw on pattern, to take
their principles from that realm and from the thinking There: but in
that they bring these down into contact with the 
sense-order, they are
not wholly in the Intellectual: they are founded in man. So
agriculture, dealing with material growths: so medicine watching
over physical health; so the art which aims at corporeal strength
and well-being: power and well-being mean something else There, the
fearlessness and self-sufficing quality of all that lives.

<P>Oratory and generalship, administration and sovereignty- 
under any
forms in which their activities are associated with Good and 
when they
look to that- possess something derived thence and building up their
knowledge from the knowledge There.

<P>Geometry, the science of the Intellectual entities, holds place
There: so, too, philosophy, whose high concern is Being.

<P>For the arts and products of art, these observations may suffice.
