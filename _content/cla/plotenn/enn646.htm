<P>8. So much for the thing of sense; but it would appear that the
prototype There of the living form, the universal horse, must look
deliberately towards this sphere; and, that being so, the idea of
horse must have been worked out in order there be a horse here?

<P>Yet what was that there to present the idea of the horse it was
desired to produce? Obviously the idea of horse must exist before
there was any planning to make a horse; it could not be thought of
in order to be made; there must have been horse unproduced 
before that
which was later to come into being. If, then, the thing 
existed before
it was produced- if it cannot have been thought of in order to its
production- the Being that held the horse as There held it 
in presence
without any looking to this sphere; it was not with intent to set
horse and the rest in being here that they were contained 
There; it is
that, the universal existing, the reproduction followed of necessity
since the total of things was not to halt at the 
Intellectual. Who was
there to call a halt to a power capable at once of
self-concentration and of outflow?

<P>But how come these animals of earth to be There? What 
have they to
do within God? Reasoning beings, all very well; but this host of the
unreasoning, what is there august in them? Surely the very contrary?

<P>The answer is that obviously the unity of our universe must be
that of a manifold since it is subsequent to that unity-absolute;
otherwise it would be not next to that but the very same thing. As a
next it could not hold the higher rank of being more perfectly a
unity; it must fall short: since the best is a unity, 
inevitably there
must be something more than unity, for deficiency involves plurality.

<P>But why should it not be simply a dyad?

<P>Because neither of the constituents could ever be a pure unity,
but at the very least a duality and so progressively [in an endless
dualization]. Besides, in that first duality of the hypothesis there
would be also movement and rest, Intellect and the life included in
Intellect, all-embracing Intellect and life complete. That means
that it could not be one Intellect; it must be Intellect agglomerate
including all the particular intellects, a thing therefore 
as multiple
as all the Intellects and more so; and the life in it would nat be
that of one soul but of all the souls with the further power of
producing the single souls: it would be the entire living universe
containing much besides man; for if it contained only man, man would
be alone here.
