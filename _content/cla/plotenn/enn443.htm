<P>12. But why, after all, should it not be such a manifold as long
as it remains one substantial existence, having the multiplicity not
of a compound being but of a unity with a variety of activities?

<P>Now, no doubt, if these various activities are not themselves
substantial existences- but merely manifestations of latent
potentiality- there is no compound; but, on the other hand, 
it remains
incomplete until its substantial existence be expressed in 
act. If its
substantial existence consists in its Act, and this Act constitutes
multiplicity, then its substantial existence will be strictly
proportioned to the extent of the multiplicity.

<P>We allow this to be true for the Intellectual-Principle to which
we have allotted [the multiplicity of] self-knowing; but for 
the first
principle of all, never. Before the manifold, there must be The One,
that from which the manifold rises: in all numerical series, the
unit is the first.

<P>But- we will be answered- for number, well and good, since the
suite makes a compound; but in the real beings why must there be a
unit from which the multiplicity of entities shall proceed?

<P>Because [failing such a unity] the multiplicity would consist of
disjointed items, each starting at its own distinct place and moving
accidentally to serve to a total.

<P>But, they will tell us, the Activities in question do 
proceed from
a unity, from the Intellectual-Principle, a simplex.

<P>By that they admit the existence of a simplex prior to the
Activities; and they make the Activities perdurable and class them
as substantial existences [hypostases]; but as Hypostases 
they will be
distinct from their source, which will remain simplex; while its
product will in its own nature be manifold and dependent upon it.

<P>Now if these activities arise from some unexplained 
first activity
in that principle, then it too contains the manifold: if, on the
contrary, they are the very earliest activities and the source and
cause of any multiple product and the means by which that 
Principle is
able, before any activity occurs, to remain self-centred, then they
are allocated to the product of which they are the cause; for this
principle is one thing, the activities going forth from it are
another, since it is not, itself, in act. If this be not so, 
the first
act cannot be the Intellectual-Principle: the One does not 
provide for
the existence of an Intellectual-Principle which thereupon appears;
that provision would be something [an Hypostasis] intervening
between the One and the Intellectual-Principle, its offspring. There
could, in fact, be no such providing in The One, for it was never
incomplete; and such provision could name nothing that ought to be
provided. It cannot be thought to possess only some part of its
content, and not the whole; nor did anything exist to which it could
turn in desire. Clearly anything that comes into being after it,
arises without shaking to its permanence in its own habit. It is
essential to the existence of any new entity that the First remain
in self-gathered repose throughout: otherwise, it moved before there
was motion and had intellectual act before any intellection- unless,
indeed, that first act [as motionless and without intelligence] was
incomplete, nothing more than a tendency. And what can we imagine it
lights upon to become the object of such a tendency?

<P>The only reasonable explanation of act flowing from it 
lies in the
analogy of light from a sun. The entire intellectual order may be
figured as a kind of light with the One in repose at its 
summit as its
King: but this manifestation is not cast out from it: we may think,
rather, of the One as a light before the light, an eternal 
irradiation
resting upon the Intellectual Realm; this, not identical with its
source, is yet not severed from it nor of so remote a nature as to
be less than Real-Being; it is no blind thing, but is seeing and
knowing, the primal knower.

<P>The One, as transcending Intellect, transcends knowing: above
all need, it is above the need of the knowing which pertains 
solely to
the Secondary Nature. Knowing is a unitary thing, but defined: the
first is One, but undefined: a defined One would not be the
One-absolute: the absolute is prior to the definite.
