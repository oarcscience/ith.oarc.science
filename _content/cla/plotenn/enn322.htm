<P>3. But it leaves that conjunction; it cannot suffer that 
unity; it
falls in love with its own powers and possessions, and desires to
stand apart; it leans outward so to speak: then, it appears 
to acquire
a memory of itself.

<P>In this self-memory a distinction is to be made; the memory
dealing with the Intellectual Realm upbears the soul, not to 
fall; the
memory of things here bears it downwards to this universe; the
intermediate memory dealing with the heavenly sphere holds it there
too; and, in all its memory, the thing it has in mind it is and
grows to; for this bearing-in-mind must be either intuition [i.e.,
knowledge with identity] or representation by image: and the imaging
in the case of the is not a taking in of something but is vision and
condition- so much so, that, in its very sense- sight, it is 
the lower
in the degree in which it penetrates the object. Since its
possession of the total of things is not primal but 
secondary, it does
not become all things perfectly [in becoming identical with 
the All in
the Intellectual]; it is of the boundary order, situated between two
regions, and has tendency to both.
