<P>2. Let every soul recall, then, at the outset the truth that
soul is the author of all living things, that it has 
breathed the life
into them all, whatever is nourished by earth and sea, all the
creatures of the air, the divine stars in the sky; it is the maker
of the sun; itself formed and ordered this vast heaven and conducts
all that rhythmic motion; and it is a principle distinct from all
these to which it gives law and movement and life, and it must of
necessity be more honourable than they, for they gather or 
dissolve as
soul brings them life or abandons them, but soul, since it never can
abandon itself, is of eternal being.

<P>How life was purveyed to the universe of things and to the
separate beings in it may be thus conceived:

<P>That great soul must stand pictured before another soul, one not
mean, a soul that has become worthy to look, emancipate from 
the lure,
from all that binds its fellows in bewitchment, holding itself in
quietude. Let not merely the enveloping body be at peace, body's
turmoil stilled, but all that lies around, earth at peace, and sea
at peace, and air and the very heavens. Into that heaven, 
all at rest,
let the great soul be conceived to roll inward at every point,
penetrating, permeating, from all sides pouring in its light. As the
rays of the sun throwing their brilliance upon a lowering cloud make
it gleam all gold, so the soul entering the material expanse of the
heavens has given life, has given immortality: what was abject it
has lifted up; and the heavenly system, moved now in endless 
motion by
the soul that leads it in wisdom, has become a living and a blessed
thing; the soul domiciled within, it takes worth where, before the
soul, it was stark body- clay and water- or, rather, the blankness
of Matter, the absence of Being, and, as an author says, "the
execration of the Gods."

<P>The Soul's nature and power will be brought out more 
clearly, more
brilliantly, if we consider next how it envelops the heavenly system
and guides all to its purposes: for it has bestowed itself upon all
that huge expanse so that every interval, small and great alike, all
has been ensouled.

<P>The material body is made up of parts, each holding its 
own place,
some in mutual opposition and others variously interdependent; the
soul is in no such condition; it is not whittled down so that life
tells of a part of the soul and springs where some such separate
portion impinges; each separate life lives by the soul entire,
omnipresent in the likeness of the engendering father, 
entire in unity
and entire in diffused variety. By the power of the soul the
manifold and diverse heavenly system is a unit: through soul this
universe is a God: and the sun is a God because it is 
ensouled; so too
the stars: and whatsoever we ourselves may be, it is all in virtue
of soul; for "dead is viler than dung."

<P>This, by which the gods are divine, must be the oldest 
God of them
all: and our own soul is of that same Ideal nature, so that to
consider it, purified, freed from all accruement, is to recognise in
ourselves that same value which we have found soul to be, honourable
above all that is bodily. For what is body but earth, and, 
taking fire
itself, what [but soul] is its burning power? So it is with all the
compounds of earth and fire, even with water and air added to them?

<P>If, then, it is the presence of soul that brings worth, how can
a man slight himself and run after other things? You honour the Soul
elsewhere; honour then yourself.
