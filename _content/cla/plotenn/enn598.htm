<P>9. If in such a partition of the unity, that which entered into
each participant were an entire- always identical with the first-
then, in the progressive severance, the firsts would become
numerous, each particular becoming a first: and then what prevents
these many firsts from reconstituting the collective unity?
Certainly not the bodies they have entered, for those firsts 
cannot be
present in the material masses as their Forms if they are to remain
identical with the First from which they come. On the other hand,
taking the part conceived as present in the multiple to be simply a
power [emanating from the First], at once such a part ceases 
to be the
unity; we have then to ask how these powers come to be cut off, to
have abandoned their origin; they certainly have not moved away with
no purpose in their movement.

<P>Again, are those powers, entering the universe of sense, still
within the First or not?

<P>If they are not, we have the absurdity that the First has been
lessened, disempowered, stripped of power originally possessed.
Besides, how could powers thus cut off subsist apart from the
foundations of their being? Suppose these powers to be at once
within the First and elsewhere; then the universe of sense contains
either the entire powers or parts of them; if parts of powers, the
other parts are There; if entires, then either the powers There are
present here also undivided- and this brings us back to an identity
omnipresent in integral identity- or they are each an entire 
which has
taken division into a multiplicity of similars so that attached to
every essence there is one power only- that particularly
appropriated to it- the other powers remaining powers unattached:
yet power apart from Being is as impossible as Being apart 
from power;
for There power is Being or something greater than Being.

<P>Or, again, suppose the powers coming Thence are other than their
source- lesser, fainter, as a bright light dwindles to a 
dim- but each
attached to its essence as a power must always be: such secondary
powers would be perfectly uniform and at once we are forced to admit
the omnipresence of the one same power or at the least the presence-
as in one and the same body- of some undivided identity integral at
every point.

<P>And if this is the case with a particular body, why not with the
entire universe?

<P>If we think of the single power as being endlessly divided, it
is no longer a power entire; partition means lessening of power;
and, with part of power for part of body, the conditions of
consciousness cease.

<P>Further, a vestigial cut off from its source disappears- for
example, a reflected light- and in general an emanant loses its
quality once it is severed from the original which it 
reproduces: just
so the powers derived from that source must vanish if they do not
remain attached to it.

<P>This being so, where these powers appear, their source must be
present with them; thus, once more, that source must itself be
omnipresent as an undivided whole.
