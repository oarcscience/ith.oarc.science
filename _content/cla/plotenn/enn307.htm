<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 21</H4>

<P>21. What does all this come to? What answer do we give 
to him who,
with no opinion of his own to assert, asks us to explain this
presence? And what do we say to the question whether there 
is one only
mode of presence of the entire soul or different modes, phase and
phase?

<P>Of the modes currently accepted for the presence of one thing in
another, none really meets the case of the soul's relation to the
body. Thus we are given as a parallel the steersman in the ship;
this serves adequately to indicate that the soul is potentially
separable, but the mode of presence, which is what we are seeking,
it does not exhibit.

<P>We can imagine it within the body in some incidental way- for
example, as a voyager in a ship- but scarcely as the steersman: and,
of course, too, the steersman is not omnipresent to the ship as the
soul is to the body.

<P>May we, perhaps, compare it to the science or skill that acts
through its appropriate instruments- through a helm, let us 
say, which
should happen to be a live thing- so that the soul effecting the
movements dictated by seamanship is an indwelling directive force?

<P>No: the comparison breaks down, since the science is something
outside of helm and ship.

<P>Is it any help to adopt the illustration of the steersman taking
the helm, and to station the soul within the body as the 
steersman may
be thought to be within the material instrument through which he
works? Soul, whenever and wherever it chooses to operate, 
does in much
that way move the body.

<P>No; even in this parallel we have no explanation of the mode of
presence within the instrument; we cannot be satisfied 
without further
search, a closer approach.
