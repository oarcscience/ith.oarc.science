<P>9. But when he is out of himself, reason quenched by sickness or
by magic arts?

<P>If it be allowed that in this state, resting as it were in a
slumber, he remains a Sage, why should he not equally remain 
happy? No
one rules him out of felicity in the hours of sleep; no one counts
up that time and so denies that he has been happy all his life.

<P>If they say that, failing consciousness, he is no longer 
the Sage,
then they are no longer reasoning about the Sage: but we do suppose
a Sage, and are enquiring whether, as long as he is the 
Sage, he is in
the state of felicity.

<P>"Well, a Sage let him remain," they say, "still, having no
sensation and not expressing his virtue in act, how can he be happy?"

<P>But a man unconscious of his health may be, none the less,
healthy: a man may not be aware of his personal attraction, but he
remains handsome none the less: if he has no sense of his wisdom,
shall he be any the less wise?

<P>It may perhaps be urged that sensation and consciousness are
essential to wisdom and that happiness is only wisdom brought to act.

<P>Now, this argument might have weight if prudence, wisdom, were
something fetched in from outside: but this is not so: wisdom is, in
its essential nature, an Authentic-Existence, or rather is The
Authentic-Existent- and this Existent does not perish in one asleep
or, to take the particular case presented to us, in the man 
out of his
mind: the Act of this Existent is continuous within him; and is a
sleepless activity: the Sage, therefore, even unconscious, is still
the Sage in Act.

<P>This activity is screened not from the man entire but merely
from one part of him: we have here a parallel to what happens in the
activity of the physical or vegetative life in us which is not made
known by the sensitive faculty to the rest of the man: if 
our physical
life really constituted the "We," its Act would be our Act: but, in
the fact, this physical life is not the "We"; the "We" is 
the activity
of the Intellectual-Principle so that when the Intellective is in
Act we are in Act.
