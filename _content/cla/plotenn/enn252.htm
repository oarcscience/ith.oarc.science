<P>1. Eternity and Time; two entirely separate things, we explain
"the one having its being in the everlasting Kind, the other in the
realm of Process, in our own Universe"; and, by continually using
the words and assigning every phenomenon to the one or the other
category, we come to think that, both by instinct and by the more
detailed attack of thought, we hold an adequate experience of them
in our minds without more ado.

<P>When, perhaps, we make the effort to clarify our ideas and close
into the heart of the matter we are at once unsettled: our doubts
throw us back upon ancient explanations; we choose among the various
theories, or among the various interpretations of some one 
theory, and
so we come to rest, satisfied, if only we can counter a question
with an approved answer, and glad to be absolved from 
further enquiry.

<P>Now, we must believe that some of the venerable philosophers of
old discovered the truth; but it is important to examine 
which of them
really hit the mark and by what guiding principle we can ourselves
attain to certitude.

<P>What, then, does Eternity really mean to those who describe it
as something different from Time? We begin with Eternity, since when
the standing Exemplar is known, its representation in image- which
Time is understood to be- will be clearly apprehended- 
though it is of
course equally true, admitting this relationship to Time as image to
Eternity the original, that if we chose to begin by identifying Time
we could thence proceed upwards by Recognition [the Platonic
Anamnesis] and become aware of the Kind which it images.
