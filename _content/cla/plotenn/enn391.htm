<P>8. E. (13) We come to the doctrine of the Entelechy, and must
enquire how it is applied to soul.

<P>It is thought that in the Conjoint of body and soul the 
soul holds
the rank of Form to the Matter which here is the ensouled body- not,
then, Form to every example of body or to body as merely such, but
to a natural organic body having the potentiality of life.

<P>Now; if the soul has been so injected as to be assimilated into
the body as the design of a statue is worked into the bronze, it
will follow that, upon any dividing of the body, the soul is divided
with it, and if any part of the body is cut away a fragment of soul
must go with it. Since an Entelechy must be inseparable from the
being of which it is the accomplished actuality, the 
withdrawal of the
soul in sleep cannot occur; in fact sleep itself cannot occur.
Moreover if the soul is an Entelechy, there is an end to the
resistance offered by reason to the desires; the total [of body and
Entelechy-Soul] must have one-uniform experience throughout, and be
aware of no internal contradiction. Sense-perception might occur;
but intellection would be impossible. The very upholders of the
Entelechy are thus compelled to introduce another soul, the
Intellect, to which they ascribe immortality. The reasoning soul,
then, must be an Entelechy- if the word is to be used at all- in some
other mode.

<P>Even the sense-perceiving soul, in its possession of the
impressions of absent objects, must hold these without aid from the
body; for otherwise the impression must be present in it like shape
and images, and that would mean that it could not take in fresh
impressions; the perceptive soul, then, cannot be described as this
Entelechy inseparable from the body. Similarly the desiring
principle, dealing not only with food and drink but with things
quite apart from body; this also is no inseparable Entelechy.

<P>There remains the vegetal principle which might seem to suggest
the possibility that, in this phase, the soul may be the inseparable
Entelechy of the doctrine. But it is not so. The principle of every
growth lies at the root; in many plants the new springing takes
place at the root or just above it: it is clear that the
life-principle, the vegetal soul, has abandoned the upper portions
to concentrate itself at that one spot: it was therefore not present
in the whole as an inseparable Entelechy. Again, before the plant's
development the life-principle is situated in that small beginning:
if, thus, it passes from large growth to small and from the small to
the entire growth, why should it not pass outside altogether?

<P>An Entelechy is not a thing of parts; how then could it be
present partwise in the partible body?

<P>An identical soul is now the soul of one living being now of
another: how could the soul of the first become the soul of 
the latter
if soul were the Entelechy of one particular being? Yet that this
transference does occur is evident from the facts of animal
metasomatosis.

<P>The substantial existence of the soul, then, does not depend
upon serving as Form to anything: it is an Essence which 
does not come
into being by finding a seat in body; it exists before it 
becomes also
the soul of some particular, for example, of a living being, whose
body would by this doctrine be the author of its soul.

<P>What, then, is the soul's Being? If it is neither body 
nor a state
or experience of body, but is act and creation: if it holds much and
gives much, and is an existence outside of body; of what order and
character must it be? Clearly it is what we describe as Veritable
Essence. The other order, the entire corporeal Kind, is process; it
appears and it perishes; in reality it never possesses Being, but is
merely protected, in so far as it has the capacity, by participating
in what authentically is.
