<P>39. Since the Supreme has no interval, no self-differentiation
what can have this intuitional approach to it but itself? 
Therefore it
quite naturally assumes difference at the point where
Intellectual-Principle and Being are differentiated.

<P>Intellect, to act at all, must inevitably comport difference
with identity; otherwise it could not distinguish itself from its
object by standing apart from it, nor could it ever be aware of the
realm of things whose existence demands otherness, nor could there
be so much as a duality.

<P>Again, if the Supreme is to have intellection it cannot know
only itself; that would not be intellection, for, if it did know
itself, nothing could prevent it knowing all things; but this is
impossible. With self-intellection it would no longer be simplex;
any intellection, even in the Supreme, must be aware of something
distinct; as we have been saying, the inability to see the self as
external is the negation of intellection. That act requires a
manifold-agent, object, movement and all the other conditions of a
thinking principle. Further we must remember what has been indicated
elsewhere that, since every intellectual act in order to be what it
must be requires variety, every movement simple and the same
throughout, though it may comport some form of contact, is devoid of
the intellective.

<P>It follows that the Supreme will know neither itself nor
anything else but will hold an august repose. All the rest is later;
before them all, This was what This was; any awareness of that other
would be acquired, the shifting knowledge of the instable. Even in
knowing the stable he would be manifold, for it is not possible
that, while in the act of knowing the laters possess themselves of
their object, the Supreme should know only in some unpossessing
observation.

<P>As regards Providence, that is sufficiently saved by the 
fact that
This is the source from which all proceeds; the dependent he cannot
know when he has no knowledge of himself but keeps that 
august repose.
Plato dealing with essential Being allows it intellection 
but not this
august repose: intellection then belongs to Essential Being; this
august repose to the Principle in which there is no intellection.
Repose, of course, is used here for want of a fitter word; we are to
understand that the most august, the truly so, is That which
transcends [the movement of] Intellection.
