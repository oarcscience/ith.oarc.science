<P>1. What can it be that has brought the souls to forget 
the father,
God, and, though members of the Divine and entirely of that world,
to ignore at once themselves and It?

<P>The evil that has overtaken them has its source in self-will, in
the entry into the sphere of process, and in the primal
differentiation with the desire for self ownership. They conceived a
pleasure in this freedom and largely indulged their own motion; thus
they were hurried down the wrong path, and in the end, drifting
further and further, they came to lose even the thought of their
origin in the Divine. A child wrenched young from home and brought
up during many years at a distance will fail in knowledge of its
father and of itself: the souls, in the same way, no longer discern
either the divinity or their own nature; ignorance of their rank
brings self-depreciation; they misplace their respect, honouring
everything more than themselves; all their awe and admiration is for
the alien, and, clinging to this, they have broken apart, as far as
a soul may, and they make light of what they have deserted; their
regard for the mundane and their disregard of themselves bring about
their utter ignoring of the divine.

<P>Admiring pursuit of the external is a confession of inferiority;
and nothing thus holding itself inferior to things that rise and
perish, nothing counting itself less honourable and less 
enduring than
all else it admires could ever form any notion of either the 
nature or
the power of God.

<P>A double discipline must be applied if human beings in this pass
are to be reclaimed, and brought back to their origins, lifted once
more towards the Supreme and One and First.

<P>There is the method, which we amply exhibit elsewhere, declaring
the dishonour of the objects which the Soul holds here in honour;
the second teaches or recalls to the soul its race and worth; this
latter is the leading truth, and, clearly brought out, is 
the evidence
of the other.

<P>It must occupy us now for it bears closely upon our enquiry to
which it is the natural preliminary: the seeker is soul and it must
start from a true notion of the nature and quality by which soul may
undertake the search; it must study itself in order to learn whether
it has the faculty for the enquiry, the eye for the object proposed,
whether in fact we ought to seek; for if the object is alien the
search must be futile, while if there is relationship the solution
of our problem is at once desirable and possible.
