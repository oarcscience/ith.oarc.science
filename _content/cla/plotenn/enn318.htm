<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 32</H4>

<P>32. But the memory of friends, children, wife? Country too, and
all that the better sort of man may reasonably remember?

<P>All these, the one [the lower man] retains with emotion, the
authentic man passively: for the experience, certainly, was 
first felt
in that lower phase from which, however, the best of such
impressions pass over to the graver soul in the degree in which the
two are in communication.

<P>The lower soul must be always striving to attain to memory of
the activities of the higher: this will be especially so when it is
itself of a fine quality, for there will always be some that are
better from the beginning and bettered here by the guidance of the
higher.

<P>The loftier, on the contrary, must desire to come to a happy
forgetfulness of all that has reached it through the lower: for one
reason, there is always the possibility that the very excellence of
the lower prove detrimental to the higher, tending to keep it down
by sheer force of vitality. In any case the more urgent the
intention towards the Supreme, the more extensive will be the soul's
forgetfulness, unless indeed, when the entire living has, even here,
been such that memory has nothing but the noblest to deal with: in
this world itself, all is best when human interests have been held
aloof; so, therefore, it must be with the memory of them. In this
sense we may truly say that the good soul is the forgetful. It flees
multiplicity; it seeks to escape the unbounded by drawing all to
unity, for only thus is it free from entanglement, light-footed,
self-conducted. Thus it is that even in this world the soul which
has the desire of the other is putting away, amid its actual 
life, all
that is foreign to that order. It brings there very little of what
it has gathered here; as long as it is in the heavenly regions only,
it will have more than it can retain.

<P>The Hercules of the heavenly regions would still tell of his
feats: but there is the other man to whom all of that is trivial; he
has been translated to a holier place; he has won his way to the
Intellectual Realm; he is more than Hercules, proven in the 
combats in
which the combatants are the wise.
