<P>6. Granted, then, that there exist, apart from things, a unity
absolute and a decad absolute in other words, that the Intellectual
beings, together with their characteristic essence have also their
order, Henads, Dyads, Triads, what is the nature of these numerical
entities and how does it come into being? We cannot but think that
some reason accounts for their origin.

<P>As a beginning, what is the origin of the Ideas in general? It
is not that the thinking principle thought of each Idea and by that
act of thought procured their several existences; not because
Justice and Movement were thus thought did they come to be; 
that would
imply that while the thought is later than the thing- the concept of
Justice must be later than Justice itself- yet the thought precedes
what, as founded on the thinking, owes its existence to it. Besides,
if justice is only a certain definite thought we have the absurdity
that Justice is nothing more than a definition of Justice. 
Thinking of
Justice or Movement is but grasping their nature; this would mean
grasping the non-existent, an impossibility.

<P>We may be reminded that in immaterial objects the knowledge is
identical with the thing; but we must not misapply that statement;
it does not say that the knowledge is the thing known, or that the
reason surveying the thing is the thing, but that the immaterial
thing, being an Intellectual object is also a thought; this does not
imply a definition or conception of the object; the thing itself, as
belonging to the Intellectual, can be nothing else than Intellect or
knowledge. This is not a case of knowledge self-directed; it is that
the thing in the Intellectual transmutes the knowledge, which is not
fixed like the knowledge of material things; in other words it makes
it true knowledge, that is to say no image of the thing but the
thing directly.

<P>Thus it is not the conception of movement that brings movement
to be; movement absolute produces that conception; it produces
itself as at once movement and the concept of movement, for movement
as it exists There, bound up with Being, is a concept. It is
movement absolute because it is the first movement- there can be
none till this exist- and it is the authentic Movement since 
it is not
accidental to something else but is the activity of actual Being in
motion. Thus it is a real existent, though the notion of Being is
different.

<P>Justice therefore is not the thought of Justice but, as 
we may put
it, a state of the Intellectual-Principle, or rather an activity of
it- an appearance so lovely that neither evening nor dawn is so
fair, nor anything else in all the realm of sense, an Intellectual
manifestation self-rising, self-seen, or, rather, self-being.
