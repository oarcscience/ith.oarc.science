<P>6. The Intellectual Beings, thus, are multiple and one; in
virtue of their infinite nature their unity is a 
multiplicity, many in
one and one over many, a unit-plurality. They act as entire upon
entire; even upon the partial thing they act as entire; but there is
the difference that at first the partial accepts this working only
partially though the entire enters later. Thus, when Man enters into
human form there exists a particular man who, however, is still Man.
From the one thing Man- man in the Idea- material man has come to
constitute many individual men: the one identical thing is present
in multiplicity, in multi-impression, so to speak, from the one seal.

<P>This does not mean that Man Absolute, or any Absolute, or the
Universe in the sense of a Whole, is absorbed by multiplicity; on
the contrary, the multiplicity is absorbed by the Absolute, or
rather is bound up with it. There is a difference between the mode
in which a colour may be absorbed by a substance entire and that in
which the soul of the individual is identically present in every
part of the body: it is in this latter mode that Being is 
omnipresent.
