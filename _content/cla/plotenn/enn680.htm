<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 42</H4>

<P>42. Faced by the difficulty of placing these powers, you must in
reason allocate to the secondaries what you count august:
secondaries must not be foisted upon the First, or 
tertiaries upon the
secondaries. Secondaries are to be ranged under the First,
tertiaries under the secondaries: this is giving everything 
its place,
the later dependent on their priors, those priors free.

<P>This is included in that true saying "About the King of All, all
has being and in view of Him all is": we are to understand from the
attribution of all things to Him, and from, the words "in 
view of Him"
that He is their cause and they reach to Him as to something 
differing
from them all and containing nothing that they contain: for
certainly His very nature requires that nothing of the later be in
Him.

<P>Thus, Intellectual-Principle, finding place in the universe,
cannot have place in Him. Where we read that He is the cause of all
beauty we are clearly to understand that beauty depends upon the
Forms, He being set above all that is beautiful here. The 
Forms are in
that passage secondaries, their sequels being attached to them as
dependent thirds: it is clear thus that by "the products of the
thirds" is meant this world, dependent upon soul.

<P>Soul dependent upon Intellectual-Principle and
Intellectual-Principle upon the Good, all is linked to the Supreme
by intermediaries, some close, some nearing those of the closer
attachment, while the order of sense stands remotest, dependent upon
soul.

<P></P>
