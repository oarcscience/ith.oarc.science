<P>37. We must not rob the universe of any factor in its being. If
any of our theorists of to-day seek to explain the action of fire-
or of any other such form, thought of as an agent- they will find
themselves in difficulties unless they recognize the act to be the
object's function in the All, and give a like explanation of other
natural forces in common use.

<P>We do not habitually examine or in any way question the 
normal: we
set to doubting and working out identifications when we are 
confronted
by any display of power outside everyday experience: we wonder at a
novelty and we wonder at the customary when anyone brings 
forward some
single object and explains to our ignorance the efficacy 
vested in it.

<P>Some such power, not necessarily accompanied by reason, every
single item possesses; for each has been brought into being and into
shape within a universe; each in its kind has partaken of 
soul through
the medium of the ensouled All, as being embraced by that definitely
constituted thing: each then is a member of an animate being 
which can
include nothing that is less than a full member [and therefore a
sharer in the total of power]- though one thing is of mightier
efficacy than another, and, especially members of the heavenly
system than the objects of earth, since they draw upon a 
purer nature-
and these powers are widely productive. But productivity does not
comport intention in what appears to be the source of the thing
accomplished: there is efficacy, too, where there is no will: even
attention is not necessary to the communication of power; the very
transmission of soul may proceed without either.

<P>A living being, we know, may spring from another without any
intention, and as without loss so without consciousness in the
begetter: in fact any intention the animal exercised could be a
cause of propagation only on condition of being identical with the
animal [i.e., the theory would make intention a propagative animal,
not a mental act?]

<P>And, if intention is unnecessary to the propagation of life,
much more so is attention.
