<P>9. If we cannot but speak of Happening we must not halt at the
word but look to the intention. And what is that? That the Supreme
by possession of a certain nature and power is the Principle.
Obviously if its nature were other it would be that other and if the
difference were for the worse it would manifest itself as that
lesser being. But we must add in correction that, as 
Principle of All,
it could not be some chance product; it is not enough to say that it
could not be inferior; it could not even be in some way good, for
instance in some less perfect degree; the Principle of All must be
of higher quality than anything that follows it. It is therefore in
a sense determined- determined, I mean, by its uniqueness and not in
any sense of being under compulsion; compulsion did not co-exist
with the Supreme but has place only among secondaries and even there
can exercise no tyranny; this uniqueness is not from outside.

<P>This, then, it is; This and no other; simply what it must be; it
has not "happened" but is what by a necessity prior to all 
necessities
it must be. We cannot think of it as a chance existence; it is not
what it chanced to be but what it must be- and yet without a "Must."

<P>All the rest waits for the appearing of the king to hail him for
himself, not a being of accident and happening but 
authentically king,
authentically Principle, The Good authentically, not a being 
that acts
in conformity with goodness- and so, recognisably, a secondary- but
the total unity that he is, no moulding upon goodness but the very
Good itself.

<P>Even Being is exempt from happening: of course, anything 
happening
happens to Being, but Being itself has not happened nor is the
manner of its Being a thing of happening, of derivation; it is the
very nature of Being to be; how then can we think that this
happening can attach to the Transcendent of Being, That in 
whose power
lay the very engendering of Being?

<P>Certainly this Transcendent never happened to be what it 
is; it is
so, just as Being exists in complete identity with its own essential
nature and that of Intellectual-Principle. Certainly that which has
never passed outside of its own orbit, unbendingly what it 
is, its own
unchangeably, is that which may most strictly be said to possess its
own being: what then are we to say when we mount and contemplate
that which stands yet higher; can we conceivably say "Thus, as we
see it, thus has it happened to be"? Neither thus nor in any mode
did it happen to be; there is no happening; there is only a "Thus
and No Otherwise than Thus." And even "Thus" is false; it would
imply limit, a defined form: to know This is to be able to 
reject both
the "Thus" and the "Not-Thus," either of which classes among 
Beings to
which alone Manner of Being can attach.

<P>A "Thus" is something that attaches to everything in the world
of things: standing before the indefinable you may name any of these
sequents but you must say This is none of them: at most it is to be
conceived as the total power towards things, supremely
self-concentred, being what it wills to be or rather projecting into
existence what it wills, itself higher than all will, will a thing
beneath it. In a word it neither willed its own "Thus"- as something
to conform to- nor did any other make it "Thus."
