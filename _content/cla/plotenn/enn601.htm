<P>12. Think of a sound passing through the air and carrying a
word; an ear within range catches and comprehends; and the sound and
word will strike upon any other ear you may imagine within the
intervening void, upon any that attends; from a great distance many
eyes look to the one object and all take it fully; all this, because
eye and ear exist. In the same way, what is apt for soul will
possess itself of soul, while from the one identical presence
another will derive something else.

<P>Now the sound was diffused throughout the air not in sections
but as one sound, entire at every point of that space. So with
sight: if the air carries a shape impressed upon it this is one
undivided whole; for, wherever there be an eye, there the shape will
be grasped; even to such as reject this particular theory of sight,
the facts of vision still stand as an example of participation
determined by an identical unity.

<P>The sound is the clearer illustration: the form conveyed is an
entirety over all the air space, for unless the spoken word were
entire at every point, for every ear to catch the whole alike, the
same effect could not be made upon every listener; the sound,
evidently, is not strung along the air, section to section. 
Why, then,
need we hesitate to think of soul as a thing not extended in broken
contact, part for part, but omnipresent within the range of its
presence, indwelling in totality at every point throughout the All?

<P>Entered into such bodies as are apt to it, the soul is like the
spoken sound present in the air, before that entry, like the speaker
about to speak- though even embodied it remains at once the speaker
and the silent.

<P>No doubt these illustrations are imperfect, but they carry a
serviceable similitude: the soul belongs to that other Kind, and we
must not conceive a part of it embodied and a part intact; it is at
once a self-enclosed unity and a principle manifested in diversity.

<P>Further, any newcoming entity achieving soul receives 
mysteriously
that same principle which was equally in the previously ensouled;
for it is not in the dispensation that a given part of soul 
situate at
some given point should enter here and there; what is thought of as
entering was always a self-enclosed entire and, for all the seeming
entry, so remains; no real entry is conceivable. If, then, the soul
never entered and yet is now seen to be present- present without
waiting upon the participant- clearly it is present, here 
too, without
breach of its self-inclusion. This can mean only that the
participant came to soul; it lay outside the veritable reality but
advanced towards it and so established itself in the kosmos of life.
But this kosmos of life is a self-gathered entire, not divisible
into constituent masses but prior to mass; in other words, the
participation is of entire in entire. Any newcomer into that 
kosmos of
life will participate in it entire. Admitting, then, that this
kosmos of life is present entire in the universe, it must be 
similarly
entire in each several entity; an identity numerically one, 
it must be
an undivided entire, omnipresent.
