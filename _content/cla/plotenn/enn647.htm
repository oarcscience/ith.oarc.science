<P>9. Admitted, then- it will be said- for the nobler forms of
life; but how can the divine contain the mean, the unreasoning? The
mean is the unreasoning, since value depends upon reason and 
the worth
of the intellective implies worthlessness where intellection is
lacking. Yet how can there be question of the unreasoning or
unintellective when all particulars exist in the divine and 
come forth
from it?

<P>In taking up the refutation of these objections, we must insist
upon the consideration that neither man nor animals here can be
thought of as identical with the counterparts in the higher realm;
those ideal forms must be taken in a larger way. And again the
reasoning thing is not of that realm: here the reasoning, There the
pre-reasoning.

<P>Why then does man alone reason here, the others remaining
reasonless?

<P>Degrees of reasoning here correspond to degrees of 
Intellection in
that other sphere, as between man and the other living beings There;
and those others do in some measure act by understanding.

<P>But why are they not at man's level of reason: why also the
difference from man to man?

<P>We must reflect that, since the many forms of lives are 
movements-
and so with the Intellections- they cannot be identical: 
there must be
different lives, distinct intellections, degrees of lightsomeness
and clarity: there must be firsts, seconds, thirds, determined by
nearness to the Firsts. This is how some of the Intellections are
gods, others of a secondary order having what is here known 
as reason,
while others again belong to the so-called unreasoning: but what we
know here as unreasoning was There a Reason-Principle; the
unintelligent was an Intellect; the Thinker of Horse was 
Intellect and
the Thought, Horse, was an Intellect.

<P>But [it will be objected] if this were a matter of mere thinking
we might well admit that the intellectual concept, remaining
concept, should take in the unintellectual, but where concept is
identical with thing how can the one be an Intellection and the
other without intelligence? Would not this be Intellect making
itself unintelligent?

<P>No: the thing is not unintelligent; it is Intelligence in a
particular mode, corresponding to a particular aspect of Life; and
just as life in whatever form it may appear remains always life, so
Intellect is not annulled by appearing in a certain mode.
Intellectual-Principle adapted to some particular living being does
not cease to be the Intellectual-Principle of all, including 
man: take
it where you will, every manifestation is the whole, though in some
special mode; the particular is produced but the possibility is of
all. In the particular we see the Intellectual-Principle in
realization; the realized is its latest phase; in one case the last
aspect is "horse"; at "horse" ended the progressive outgoing towards
the lesser forms of life, as in another case it will end at
something lower still. The unfolding of the powers of this Principle
is always attended by some abandonment in regard to the highest; the
outgoing is by loss, and by this loss the powers become one thing or
another according to the deficiency of the life-form produced by the
failing principle; it is then that they find the means of adding
various requisites; the safeguards of the life becoming inadequate
there appear nail, talon, fang, horn. Thus the
Intellectual-Principle by its very descent is directed towards the
perfect sufficiency of the natural constitution, finding there
within itself the remedy of the failure.
