<P>4. The present existence of the Ideal-Forms has been
demonstrated elsewhere: we take up our argument from that point.

<P>If, then, there is more than one of such forming Ideas, 
there must
of necessity be some character common to all and equally 
some peculiar
character in each keeping them distinct.

<P>This peculiar characteristic, this distinguishing difference, is
the individual shape. But if shape, then there is the shaped, that
in which the difference is lodged.

<P>There is, therefore, a Matter accepting the shape, a permanent
substratum.

<P>Further, admitting that there is an Intelligible Realm beyond,
of which this world is an image, then, since this world-compound is
based on Matter, there must be Matter there also.

<P>And how can you predicate an ordered system without thinking of
form, and how think of form apart from the notion of something in
which the form is lodged?

<P>No doubt that Realm is, in the strict fact, utterly 
without parts,
but in some sense there is part there too. And in so far as these
parts are really separate from each other, any such division and
difference can be no other than a condition of Matter, of a
something divided and differentiated: in so far as that realm,
though without parts, yet consists of a variety of entities, these
diverse entities, residing in a unity of which they are variations,
reside in a Matter; for this unity, since it is also a 
diversity, must
be conceived of as varied and multiform; it must have been shapeless
before it took the form in which variation occurs. For if we
abstract from the Intellectual-Principle the variety and the
particular shapes, the Reason-Principles and the Thoughts, what
precedes these was something shapeless and undetermined, nothing of
what is actually present there.
