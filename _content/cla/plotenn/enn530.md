#### Section 24

24\. There remains Situation, which like Possession is confined to a few
instances such as reclining and sitting.

Even so, the term is not used without qualification: we say "they are
placed in such and such a manner," "he is situated in such and such a
position." The position is added from outside the genus.

In short, Situation signifies "being in a place"; there are two things
involved, the position and the place: why then must two categories be
combined into one?

Moreover, if sitting signifies an Act, it must be classed among Acts; if
a Passion, it goes under the category to which belong Passions complete
and incomplete.

Reclining is surely nothing but "lying up," and tallies with "lying
down" and "lying midway." But if the reclining belongs thus to the
category of Relation, why not the recliner also? For as "on the right"
belongs to the Relations, so does "the thing on the right"; and
similarly with "the thing on the left."
