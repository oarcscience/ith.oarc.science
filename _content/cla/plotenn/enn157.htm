<P>2. Therefore we must affirm no more than these three Primals: we
are not to introduce superfluous distinctions which their nature
rejects. We are to proclaim one Intellectual-Principle unchangeably
the same, in no way subject to decline, acting in imitation, as true
as its nature allows, of the Father.

<P>And as to our own Soul we are to hold that it stands, in part,
always in the presence of The Divine Beings, while in part it is
concerned with the things of this sphere and in part 
occupies a middle
ground. It is one nature in graded powers; and sometimes the Soul in
its entirety is borne along by the loftiest in itself and in the
Authentic Existent; sometimes, the less noble part is 
dragged down and
drags the mid-soul with it, though the law is that the Soul may
never succumb entire.

<P>The Soul's disaster falls upon it when it ceases to dwell in the
perfect Beauty- the appropriate dwelling-place of that Soul which is
no part and of which we too are no part- thence to pour 
forth into the
frame of the All whatsoever the All can hold of good and 
beauty. There
that Soul rests, free from all solicitude, not ruling by plan or
policy, not redressing, but establishing order by the marvellous
efficacy of its contemplation of the things above it.

<P>For the measure of its absorption in that vision is the 
measure of
its grace and power, and what it draws from this contemplation it
communicates to the lower sphere, illuminated and 
illuminating always.
