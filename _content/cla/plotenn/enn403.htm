<P>4. So it is with the individual souls; the appetite for 
the divine
Intellect urges them to return to their source, but they have, too,
a power apt to administration in this lower sphere; they may be
compared to the light attached upwards to the sun, but not grudging
its presidency to what lies beneath it. In the Intellectual, then,
they remain with soul-entire, and are immune from care and 
trouble; in
the heavenly sphere, absorbed in the soul-entire, they are
administrators with it just as kings, associated with the supreme
ruler and governing with him, do not descend from their kingly
stations: the souls indeed [as distinguished from the 
kosmos] are thus
far in the one place with their overlord; but there comes a stage at
which they descend from the universal to become partial and
self-centred; in a weary desire of standing apart they find 
their way,
each to a place of its very own. This state long maintained, the
soul is a deserter from the All; its differentiation has severed it;
its vision is no longer set in the Intellectual; it is a partial
thing, isolated, weakened, full of care, intent upon the fragment;
severed from the whole, it nestles in one form of being; for this,
it abandons all else, entering into and caring for only the 
one, for a
thing buffeted about by a worldful of things: thus it has 
drifted away
from the universal and, by an actual presence, it administers the
particular; it is caught into contact now, and tends to the outer to
which it has become present and into whose inner depths it
henceforth sinks far.

<P>With this comes what is known as the casting of the wings, the
enchaining in body: the soul has lost that innocency of 
conducting the
higher which it knew when it stood with the All-Soul, that earlier
state to which all its interest would bid it hasten back.

<P>It has fallen: it is at the chain: debarred from 
expressing itself
now through its intellectual phase, it operates through 
sense, it is a
captive; this is the burial, the encavernment, of the Soul.

<P>But in spite of all it has, for ever, something 
transcendent: by a
conversion towards the intellective act, it is loosed from the
shackles and soars- when only it makes its memories the 
starting point
of a new vision of essential being. Souls that take this way have
place in both spheres, living of necessity the life there 
and the life
here by turns, the upper life reigning in those able to consort more
continuously with the divine Intellect, the lower dominant where
character or circumstances are less favourable.

<P>All this is indicated by Plato, without emphasis, where he
distinguishes those of the second mixing-bowl, describes them as
"parts," and goes on to say that, having in this way become partial,
they must of necessity experience birth.

<P>Of course, where he speaks of God sowing them, he is to be
understood as when he tells of God speaking and delivering orations;
what is rooted in the nature of the All is figuratively treated as
coming into being by generation and creation: stage and sequence are
transferred, for clarity of exposition, to things whose being and
definite form are eternal.
