<P>13. And we must not despise the familiar observation 
that there is
something more to be considered than the present. There are the
periods of the past and, again, those in the future; and these have
everything to do with fixing worth of place.

<P>Thus a man, once a ruler, will be made a slave because he abused
his power and because the fall is to his future good. Those that
have money will be made poor- and to the good poverty is no 
hindrance.
Those that have unjustly killed, are killed in turn, unjustly as
regards the murderer but justly as regards the victim, and those
that are to suffer are thrown into the path of those that administer
the merited treatment.

<P>It is not an accident that makes a man a slave; no one is a
prisoner by chance; every bodily outrage has its due cause. The man
once did what he now suffers. A man that murders his mother will
become a woman and be murdered by a son; a man that wrongs a woman
will become a woman, to be wronged.

<P>Hence arises that awesome word "Adrasteia" [the Inevadable
Retribution]; for in very truth this ordinance is an Adrasteia,
justice itself and a wonderful wisdom.

<P>We cannot but recognize from what we observe in this 
universe that
some such principle of order prevails throughout the entire of
existence- the minutest of things a tributary to the vast total; the
marvellous art shown not merely in the mightiest works and sublimest
members of the All, but even amid such littleness as one would think
Providence must disdain: the varied workmanship of wonder in any and
every animal form; the world of vegetation, too; the grace of fruits
and even of leaves, the lavishness, the delicacy, the diversity of
exquisite bloom; and all this not issuing once, and then to die out,
but made ever and ever anew as the Transcendent Beings move
variously over this earth.

<P>In all the changing, there is no change by chance: there is no
taking of new forms but to desirable ends and in ways worthy 
of Divine
Powers. All that is Divine executes the Act of its quality; its
quality is the expression of its essential Being: and this essential
Being in the Divine is the Being whose activities produce as 
one thing
the desirable and the just- for if the good and the just are not
produced there, where, then, have they their being?
