<P>5. But perhaps the explanation of every particular act 
or event is
rather that they are determined by the spheric movement- the Phora-
and by the changing position of the heavenly bodies as these stand
at setting or rising or in mid-course and in various aspects 
with each
other.

<P>Augury, it is urged, is able from these indications to foretell
what is to happen not merely to the universe as a whole, but even to
individuals, and this not merely as regards external conditions of
fortune but even as to the events of the mind. We observe, too, how
growth or check in other orders of beings- animals and Plants- is
determined by their sympathetic relations with the heavenly 
bodies and
how widely they are influenced by them, how, for example, the
various countries show a different produce according to their
situation on the earth and especially their lie towards the sun. And
the effect of place is not limited to plants and animals; it rules
human beings too, determining their appearance, their height and
colour, their mentality and their desires, their pursuits and their
moral habit. Thus the universal circuit would seem to be the monarch
of the All.

<P>Now a first answer to this theory is that its advocates have
merely devised another shift to immolate to the heavenly bodies all
that is ours, our acts of will and our states, all the evil 
in us, our
entire personality; nothing is allowed to us; we are left to 
be stones
set rolling, not men, not beings whose nature implies a task.

<P>But we must be allowed our own- with the understanding that to
what is primarily ours, our personal holding, there is added some
influx from the All- the distinction must be made between our
individual act and what is thrust upon us: we are not to be
immolated to the stars.

<P>Place and climate, no doubt, produce constitutions warmer or
colder; and the parents tell on the offspring, as is seen in the
resemblance between them, very general in personal appearance and
noted also in some of the unreflecting states of the mind.

<P>None the less, in spite of physical resemblance and similar
environment, we observe the greatest difference in temperament and
in ideas: this side of the human being, then, derives from some
quite other Principle [than any external causation or destiny]. A
further confirmation is found in the efforts we make to correct both
bodily constitution and mental aspirations.

<P>If the stars are held to be causing principles on the ground of
the possibility of foretelling individual fate or fortune from
observation of their positions, then the birds and all the other
things which the soothsayer observes for divination must equally be
taken as causing what they indicate.

<P>Some further considerations will help to clarify this matter:

<P>The heavens are observed at the moment of a birth and the
individual fate is thence predicted in the idea that the stars are
no mere indications, but active causes, of the future events.
Sometimes the Astrologers tell of noble birth; "the child is born of
highly placed parents"; yet how is it possible to make out the stars
to be causes of a condition which existed in the father and mother
previously to that star pattern on which the prediction is based?

<P>And consider still further:

<P>They are really announcing the fortunes of parents from the
birth of children; the character and career of children are included
in the predictions as to the parents- they predict for the yet
unborn!- in the lot of one brother they are foretelling the death of
another; a girl's fate includes that of a future husband, a 
boy's that
of a wife.

<P>Now, can we think that the star-grouping over any 
particular birth
can be the cause of what stands already announced in the facts about
the parents? Either the previous star-groupings were the
determinants of the child's future career or, if they were not, then
neither is the immediate grouping. And notice further that physical
likeness to the parents- the Astrologers hold- is of purely domestic
origin: this implies that ugliness and beauty are so caused 
and not by
astral movements.

<P>Again, there must at one and the same time be a widespread
coming to birth- men, and the most varied forms of animal life at
the same moment- and these should all be under the one destiny since
the one pattern rules at the moment; how explain that identical
star-groupings give here the human form, there the animal?
