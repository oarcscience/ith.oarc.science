<P>4. But there are earlier and loftier beauties than these. In the
sense-bound life we are no longer granted to know them, but the
soul, taking no help from the organs, sees and proclaims them. To
the vision of these we must mount, leaving sense to its own 
low place.

<P>As it is not for those to speak of the graceful forms of the
material world who have never seen them or known their 
grace- men born
blind, let us suppose- in the same way those must be silent upon the
beauty of noble conduct and of learning and all that order who have
never cared for such things, nor may those tell of the splendour of
virtue who have never known the face of Justice and of Moral-Wisdom
beautiful beyond the beauty of Evening and of dawn.

<P>Such vision is for those only who see with the Soul's sight- and
at the vision, they will rejoice, and awe will fall upon them and a
trouble deeper than all the rest could ever stir, for now they are
moving in the realm of Truth.

<P>This is the spirit that Beauty must ever induce, wonderment and
a delicious trouble, longing and love and a trembling that is all
delight. For the unseen all this may be felt as for the 
seen; and this
the Souls feel for it, every soul in some degree, but those the more
deeply that are the more truly apt to this higher love- just as all
take delight in the beauty of the body but all are not stung as
sharply, and those only that feel the keener wound are known as
Lovers.
