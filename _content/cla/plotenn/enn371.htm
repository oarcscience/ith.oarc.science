<P>6. We return, then, to the question whether there could be light
if there were no air, the sun illuminating corporeal surfaces across
an intermediate void which, as things are, takes the light
accidentally by the mere fact of being in the path. Supposing air to
be the cause of the rest of things being thus affected, the
substantial existence of light is due to the air; light becomes a
modification of the air, and of course if the thing to be 
modified did
not exist neither could be modification.

<P>The fact is that primarily light is no appanage of air, and does
not depend upon the existence of air: it belongs to every fiery and
shining body, it constitutes even the gleaming surface of certain
stones.

<P>Now if, thus, it enters into other substances from something
gleaming, could it exist in the absence of its container?

<P>There is a distinction to be made: if it is a quality, some
quality of some substance, then light, equally with other qualities,
will need a body in which to lodge: if, on the contrary, it is an
activity rising from something else, we can surely conceive it
existing, though there be no neighbouring body but, if that is
possible, a blank void which it will overleap and so appear on the
further side: it is powerful, and may very well pass over 
unhelped. If
it were of a nature to fall, nothing would keep it up, certainly not
the air or anything that takes its light; there is no reason why
they should draw the light from its source and speed it onwards.

<P>Light is not an accidental to something else, requiring
therefore to be lodged in a base; nor is it a modification,
demanding a base in which the modification occurs: if this 
were so, it
would vanish when the object or substance disappeared; but it does
not; it strikes onward; so, too [requiring neither air nor object]
it would always have its movement.

<P>But movement, where?

<P>Is space, pure and simple, all that is necessary?

<P>With unchecked motion of the light outward, the material sun
will be losing its energy, for the light is its expression.

<P>Perhaps; and [from this untenable consequence] we may gather
that the light never was an appanage of anything, but is the
expressive Act proceeding from a base [the sun] but not seeking to
enter into a base, though having some operation upon any 
base that may
be present.

<P>Life is also an Act, the Act of the soul, and it remains so when
anything- the human body, for instance- comes in its path to be
affected by it; and it is equally an Act though there be nothing for
it to modify: surely this may be true of light, one of the Acts of
whatever luminary source there be [i.e., light, affecting things,
may be quite independent of them and require no medium, air 
or other].
Certainly light is not brought into being by the dark thing, air,
which on the contrary tends to gloom it over with some touch of
earth so that it is no longer the brilliant reality: as reasonable
to talk of some substance being sweet because it is mixed with
something bitter.

<P>If we are told that light is a mode of the air, we answer that
this would necessarily imply that the air itself is changed 
to produce
the new mode; in other words, its characteristic darkness must
change into non-darkness; but we know that the air maintains its
character, in no wise affected: the modification of a thing is an
experience within that thing itself: light therefore is not a
modification of the air, but a self-existent in whose path the air
happens to be present.

<P>On this point we need dwell no longer; but there remains still a
question.
