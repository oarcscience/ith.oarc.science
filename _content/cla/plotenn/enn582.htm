<P>22. But suppose that we identify alteration with Motion on the
ground that Motion itself results in difference: how then do we
proceed to define Motion?

<P>It may roughly be characterized as the passage from the
potentiality to its realization. That is potential which can either
pass into a Form- for example, the potential statue- or else 
pass into
actuality- such as the ability to walk: whenever progress is made
towards the statue, this progress is Motion; and when the ability to
walk is actualized in walking, this walking is itself Motion:
dancing is, similarly, the motion produced by the potential dancer
taking his steps.

<P>In the one type of Motion a new Form comes into existence
created by the motion; the other constitutes, as it were, the pure
Form of the potentiality, and leaves nothing behind it when once the
motion has ceased. Accordingly, the view would not be unreasonable
which, taking some Forms to be active, others inactive, regarded
Motion as a dynamic Form in opposition to the other Forms which are
static, and further as the cause of whatever new Form ensues upon
it. To proceed to identify this bodily motion with life would
however be unwarrantable; it must be considered as identical only in
name with the motions of Intellect and Soul.

<P>That Motion is a genus we may be all the more confident in
virtue of the difficulty- the impossibility even- of confining it
within a definition.

<P>But how can it be a Form in cases where the motion leads to
deterioration, or is purely passive? Motion, we may suggest, is like
the heat of the sun causing some things to grow and withering
others. In so far as Motion is a common property, it is identical in
both conditions; its apparent difference is due to the objects moved.

<P>Is, then, becoming ill identical with becoming well? As motions
they are identical. In what respect, then, do they differ? In their
substrates? or is there some other criterion?

<P>This question may however be postponed until we come to consider
alteration: at present we have to discover what is the constant
element in every motion, for only on this basis can we establish the
claim of Motion to be a genus.

<P>Perhaps the one term covers many meanings; its claim to generic
status would then correspond to that of Being.

<P>As a solution of the problem we may suggest that motions 
conducing
to the natural state or functioning in natural conditions should
perhaps, as we have already asserted, be regarded as being in a
sense Forms, while those whose direction is contrary to 
nature must be
supposed to be assimilated to the results towards which they lead.

<P>But what is the constant element in alteration, in growth and
birth and their opposites, in local change? What is that which makes
them all motions? Surely it is the fact that in every case the
object is never in the same state before and after the 
motion, that it
cannot remain still and in complete inactivity but, so long as the
motion is present, is continually urged to take a new 
condition, never
acquiescing in Identity but always courting Difference; deprived of
Difference, Motion perishes.

<P>Thus, Difference may be predicated of Motion, not merely in the
sense that it arises and persists in a difference of conditions, but
in the sense of being itself perpetual difference. It follows that
Time, as being created by Motion, also entails perpetual difference:
Time is the measure of unceasing Motion, accompanying its course
and, as it were, carried along its stream.

<P>In short, the common basis of all Motion is the existence of a
progression and an urge from potentiality and the potential to
actuality and the actual: everything which has any kind of motion
whatsoever derives this motion from a pre-existent 
potentiality within
itself of activity or passivity.
