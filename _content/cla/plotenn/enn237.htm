<P>6. the Intellectual Essence, wholly of the order of Ideal-form,
must be taken as impassive has been already established.

<P>But Matter also is an incorporeal, though after a mode 
of its own;
we must examine, therefore, how this stands, whether it is 
passive, as
is commonly held, a thing that can be twisted to every shape 
and Kind,
or whether it too must be considered impassive and in what sense and
fashion so. But in engaging this question and defining the nature of
matter we must correct certain prevailing errors about the nature of
the Authentic Existent, about Essence, about Being.

<P>The Existent- rightly so called- is that which has authentic
existence, that, therefore, which is existent completely, and
therefore, again, that which at no point fails in existence. Having
existence perfectly, it needs nothing to preserve it in being; it
is, on the contrary, the source and cause from which all that
appears to exist derives that appearance. This admitted, it must of
necessity be in life, in a perfect life: if it failed it 
would be more
nearly the nonexistent than the existent. But: The Being thus
indicated is Intellect, is wisdom unalloyed. It is, therefore,
determined and rounded off; it is nothing potentially that is not of
the same determined order, otherwise it would be in default.

<P>Hence its eternity, its identity, its utter irreceptivity and
impermeability. If it took in anything, it must be taking in 
something
outside itself, that is to say, Existence would at last include
non-existence. But it must be Authentic Existence all through; it
must, therefore, present itself equipped from its own stores with
all that makes up Existence so that all stands together and 
all is one
thing. The Existent [Real Being] must have thus much of 
determination:
if it had not, then it could not be the source of the Intellectual
Principle and of Life which would be importations into it
originating in the sphere of non-Being; and Real Being would be
lifeless and mindless; but mindlessness and lifelessness are the
characteristics of non-being and must belong to the lower order, to
the outer borders of the existent; for Intellect and Life rise from
the Beyond-Existence [the Indefinable Supreme]- though Itself has no
need of them- and are conveyed from It into the Authentic Existent.

<P>If we have thus rightly described the Authentic Existent, we see
that it cannot be any kind of body nor the under-stuff of body; in
such entities the Being is simply the existing of things outside of
Being.

<P>But body, a non-existence? Matter, on which all this universe
rises, a non-existence? Mountain and rock, the wide solid earth, all
that resists, all that can be struck and driven, surely all
proclaims the real existence of the corporeal? And how, it will be
asked, can we, on the contrary, attribute Being, and the only
Authentic Being, to entities like Soul and Intellect, things 
having no
weight or pressure, yielding to no force, offering no resistance,
things not even visible?

<P>Yet even the corporeal realm witnesses for us; the resting earth
has certainly a scantier share in Being than belongs to what has
more motion and less solidity- and less than belongs to its own most
upward element, for fire begins, already, to flit up and away
outside of the body-kind.

<P>In fact, it appears to be precisely the most self-sufficing that
bear least hardly, least painfully, on other things, while the
heaviest and earthiest bodies- deficient, falling, unable to bear
themselves upward- these, by the very down-thrust due to their
feebleness, offer the resistance which belongs to the falling habit
and to the lack of buoyancy. It is lifeless objects that deal the
severest blows; they hit hardest and hurt most; where there is life-
that is to say participation in Being- there is beneficence towards
the environment, all the greater as the measure of Being is fuller.

<P>Again, Movement, which is a sort of life within bodies, an
imitation of true Life, is the more decided where there is the least
of body a sign that the waning of Being makes the object 
affected more
distinctly corporeal.

<P>The changes known as affections show even more clearly that
where the bodily quality is most pronounced susceptibility is at its
intensest- earth more susceptible than other elements, and these
others again more or less so in the degree of their corporeality:
sever the other elements and, failing some preventive force, 
they join
again; but earthy matter divided remains apart indefinitely. Things
whose nature represents a diminishment have no power of recuperation
after even a slight disturbance and they perish; thus what has most
definitely become body, having most closely approximated to
non-being lacks the strength to reknit its unity: the heavy and
violent crash of body against body works destruction, and weak is
powerful against weak, non-being against its like.

<P>Thus far we have been meeting those who, on the evidence 
of thrust
and resistance, identify body with real being and find assurance of
truth in the phantasms that reach us through the senses, those, in a
word, who, like dreamers, take for actualities the figments of their
sleeping vision. The sphere of sense, the Soul in its 
slumber; for all
of the Soul that is in body is asleep and the true getting-up is not
bodily but from the body: in any movement that takes the body with
it there is no more than a passage from sleep to sleep, from bed to
bed; the veritable waking or rising is from corporeal things; for
these, belonging to the Kind directly opposed to Soul, present to it
what is directly opposed to its essential existence: their origin,
their flux, and their perishing are the warning of their exclusion
from the Kind whose Being is Authentic.
