<P>29. Suppose, however, that pleasure did not result from the good
but there were something preceding pleasure and accounting for it,
would not this be a thing to be embraced?

<P>But when we say "to be embraced" we say "pleasure."

<P>But what if accepting its existence, we think of that 
existence as
leaving still the possibility that it were not a thing to be 
embraced?

<P>This would mean the good being present and the sentient
possessor failing, nonetheless, to perceive it.

<P>It would seem possible, however, to perceive and yet be 
unmoved by
the possession; this is quite likely in the case of the wiser and
least dependent- and indeed it is so with the First, immune 
not merely
because simplex, but because pleasure by acquisition implies lack.

<P>But all this will become clear on the solution of our remaining
difficulties and the rebuttal of the argument brought up against us.
This takes the form of the question: "What gain is there in the Good
to one who, fully conscious, feels nothing when he hears of these
things, whether because he has no grasp of them but takes merely the
words or because he holds to false values, perhaps being all 
in search
of sense, finding his good in money or such things?"

<P>The answer is that even in his disregard of the good proposed he
is with us in setting a good before him but fails to see how the
good we define fits into his own conception. It is impossible to say
"Not that" if one is utterly without experience or conception of the
"That"; there will generally have been, even, some inkling 
of the good
beyond Intellection. Besides, one attaining or approaching the good,
but not recognising it, may assure himself in the light of its
contraries; otherwise he will not even hold ignorance an evil though
everyone prefers to know and is proud of knowing so that our very
sensations seek to ripen into knowledge.

<P>If the knowing principle- and specially primal
Intellectual-Principle- is valuable and beautiful, what must be
present to those of power to see the Author and Father of Intellect?
Anyone thinking slightingly of this principle of Life and 
Being brings
evidence against himself and all his state: of course, distaste for
the life that is mingled with death does not touch that Life
Authentic.
