<P>7. But, if the stars announce the future- as we hold of 
many other
things also- what explanation of the cause have we to offer? What
explains the purposeful arrangement thus implied? Obviously, unless
the particular is included under some general principle of order,
there can be no signification.

<P>We may think of the stars as letters perpetually being inscribed
on the heavens or inscribed once for all and yet moving as 
they pursue
the other tasks allotted to them: upon these main tasks will follow
the quality of signifying, just as the one principle underlying any
living unit enables us to reason from member to member, so that for
example we may judge of character and even of perils and 
safeguards by
indications in the eyes or in some other part of the body. If these
parts of us are members of a whole, so are we: in different ways the
one law applies.

<P>All teems with symbol; the wise man is the man who in any one
thing can read another, a process familiar to all of us in not a few
examples of everyday experience.

<P>But what is the comprehensive principle of co-ordination?
Establish this and we have a reasonable basis for the divination,
not only by stars but also by birds and other animals, from which we
derive guidance in our varied concerns.

<P>All things must be enchained; and the sympathy and
correspondence obtaining in any one closely knit organism must
exist, first, and most intensely, in the All. There must be one
principle constituting this unit of many forms of life and enclosing
the several members within the unity, while at the same time,
precisely as in each thing of detail the parts too have each a
definite function, so in the All each several member must 
have its own
task- but more markedly so since in this case the parts are 
not merely
members but themselves Alls, members of the loftier Kind.

<P>Thus each entity takes its origin from one Principle and,
therefore, while executing its own function, works in with 
every other
member of that All from which its distinct task has by no 
means cut it
off: each performs its act, each receives something from the others,
every one at its own moment bringing its touch of sweet or 
bitter. And
there is nothing undesigned, nothing of chance, in all the process:
all is one scheme of differentiation, starting from the Firsts and
working itself out in a continuous progression of Kinds.
