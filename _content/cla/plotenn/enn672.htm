<P>34. No longer can we wonder that the principle evoking such
longing should be utterly free from shape. The very soul, once it
has conceived the straining love towards this, lays aside all the
shape it has taken, even to the Intellectual shape that has informed
it. There is no vision, no union, for those handling or acting by
any thing other; the soul must see before it neither evil 
nor good nor
anything else, that alone it may receive the Alone.

<P>Suppose the soul to have attained: the highest has come 
to her, or
rather has revealed its presence; she has turned away from all about
her and made herself apt, beautiful to the utmost, brought into
likeness with the divine by those preparings and adornings which
come unbidden to those growing ready for the vision- she has 
seen that
presence suddenly manifesting within her, for there is nothing
between: here is no longer a duality but a two in one; for, 
so long as
the presence holds, all distinction fades: it is as lover and
beloved here, in a copy of that union, long to blend; the 
soul has now
no further awareness of being in body and will give herself 
no foreign
name, not "man," not "living being," not "being," not "all"; any
observation of such things falls away; the soul has neither time nor
taste for them; This she sought and This she has found and 
on This she
looks and not upon herself; and who she is that looks she has not
leisure to know. Once There she will barter for This nothing the
universe holds; not though one would make over the heavens entire to
her; than This there is nothing higher, nothing of more good; above
This there is no passing; all the rest, however lofty, lies on the
downgoing path: she is of perfect judgement and knows that This was
her quest, that nothing higher is. Here can be no deceit; where
could she come upon truer than the truth? and the truth she affirms,
that she is, herself; but all the affirmation is later and is
silent. In this happiness she knows beyond delusion that she 
is happy;
for this is no affirmation of an excited body but of a soul become
again what she was in the time of her early joy. All that she had
welcomed of old-office, power, wealth, beauty, knowledge of all she
tells her scorn as she never could had she not found their better;
linked to This she can fear no disaster nor even know it; let all
about her fall to pieces, so she would have it that she may be
wholly with This, so huge the happiness she has won to.
