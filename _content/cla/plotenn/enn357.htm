<P>38. Whatever springs automatically from the All out of that
distinctive life of its own, and, in addition to that self-moving
activity, whatever is due to some specific agency- for example, to
prayers, simple or taking the form of magic incantations- this
entire range of production is to be referred, not to each such
single cause, but to the nature of the thing produced [i.e., to a
certain natural tendency in the product to exist with its own
quality].

<P>All that forwards life or some other useful purpose is to be
ascribed to the transmission characteristic of the All; it is
something flowing from the major of an integral to its 
minor. Where we
think we see the transmission of some force unfavourable to the
production of living beings, the flaw must be found in the inability
of the subject to take in what would serve it: for what happens does
not happen upon a void; there is always specific form and quality;
anything that could be affected must have an underlying nature
definite and characterized. The inevitable blendings, further, have
their constructive effect, every element adding something 
contributory
to the life. Then again some influence may come into play at the
time when the forces of a beneficent nature are not acting: the
co-ordination of the entire system of things does not always allow
to each several entity everything that it needs: and further we
ourselves add a great deal to what is transmitted to us.

<P>None the less all entwines into a unity: and there is something
wonderful in the agreement holding among these various things of
varied source, even of sources frankly opposite; the secret lies in
a variety within a unity. When by the standard of the better kind
among things of process anything falls short- the reluctance of its
material substratum having prevented its perfect shaping under idea-
it may be thought of as being deficient in that noble element whose
absence brings to shame: the thing is a blend, something due to the
high beings, an alloy from the underlying nature, something added by
the self.

<P>Because all is ever being knit, all brought to culmination in
unity, therefore all events are indicated; but this does not make
virtue a matter of compulsion; its spontaneity is equally 
inwoven into
the ordered system by the general law that the things of this sphere
are pendant from the higher, that the content of our universe lies
in the hands of the diviner beings in whom our world is participant.
