<P>9. The elements in their totality, as they stand produced, may
be thought of as one spheric figure; this cannot be the piecemeal
product of many makers each working from some one point on some one
portion. There must be one cause; and this must operate as an
entire, not by part executing part; otherwise we are brought 
back to a
plurality of makers. The making must be referred to a partless
unity, or, more precisely, the making principle must be a partless
unity not permeating the sphere but holding it as one 
dependent thing.
In this way the sphere is enveloped by one identical life in which
it is inset; its entire content looks to the one life: thus all the
souls are one, a one, however, which yet is infinite.

<P>It is in this understanding that the soul has been taken to be a
numerical principle, while others think of it as in its nature a
self-increasing number; this latter notion is probably designed to
meet the consideration that the soul at no point fails but,
retaining its distinctive character, is ample for all, so 
much so that
were the kosmos vaster yet the virtue of soul would still compass
it- or rather the kosmos still be sunk in soul entire.

<P>Of course, we must understand this adding of extension not as a
literal increase but in the sense that the soul, essentially a
unity, becomes adequate to omnipresence; its unity sets it outside
of quantitative measurement, the characteristic of that other order
which has but a counterfeit unity, an appearance by participation.

<P>The essential unity is no aggregate to be annulled upon the loss
of some one of the constituents; nor is it held within any allotted
limits, for so it would be the less for a set of things, more
extensive than itself, outside its scope; or it must wrench itself
asunder in the effort to reach to all; besides, its presence 
to things
would be no longer as whole to all but by part to part; in vulgar
phrase, it does not know where it stands; dismembered, it no longer
performs any one single function.

<P>Now if this principle is to be a true unity- where the 
unity is of
the essence- it must in some way be able to manifest itself as
including the contrary nature, that of potential multiplicity, while
by the fact that this multiplicity belongs to it not as from without
but as from and by itself, it remains authentically one, possessing
boundlessness and multiplicity within that unity; its nature must be
such that it can appear as a whole at every point; this, as
encircled by a single self-embracing Reason-Principle, which holds
fast about that unity, never breaking with itself but over all the
universe remaining what it must be.

<P>The unity is in this way saved from the local division of the
things in which it appears; and, of course, existing before all that
is in place, it could never be founded upon anything 
belonging to that
order of which, on the contrary, it is the foundation; yet, for all
that they are based upon it, it does not cease to be wholly
self-gathered; if its fixed seat were shaken, all the rest would
fall with the fall of their foundation and stay; nor could it be so
unintelligent as to tear itself apart by such a movement and, secure
within its own being, trust itself to the insecurity of place which,
precisely, looks to it for safety.
