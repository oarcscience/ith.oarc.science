<P>3. We assert, then, a plurality of Existents, but a plurality
not fortuitous and therefore a plurality deriving from a unity.

<P>But even admitting this derivation from a unity- a unity however
not predicated of them in respect of their essential being- there
is, surely, no reason why each of these Existents, distinct in
character from every other, should not in itself stand as a separate
genus.

<P>Is, then, this unity external to the genera thus produced, this
unity which is their source though it cannot be predicated of them
in respect of their essence? it is indeed external; the One 
is beyond;
it cannot, therefore, be included among the genera: it is the
[transcendent] source, while they stand side by side as genera. Yet
surely the one must somehow be included [among the genera]? No: it
is the Existents we are investigating, not that which is beyond
Existence.

<P>We pass on, then, to consider that which is included, and find
to our surprise the cause included with the things it causes: it is
surely strange that causes and effects should be brought 
into the same
genus.

<P>But if the cause is included with its effects only in 
the sense in
which a genus is included with its subordinates, the subordinates
being of a different order, so that it cannot be predicated of them
whether as their genus or in any other relation, these subordinates
are obviously themselves genera with subordinates of their own: you
may, for example, be the cause of the operation of walking, but the
walking is not subordinate to you in the relation of species 
to genus;
and if walking had nothing prior to it as its genus, but had
posteriors, then it would be a [primary] genus and rank among the
Existents.

<P>Perhaps, however, it must be utterly denied that unity 
is even the
cause of other things; they should be considered rather as its parts
or elements- if the terms may be allowed,- their totality 
constituting
a single entity which our thinking divides. All unity though 
it be, it
goes by a wonderful power out into everything; it appears as many
and becomes many when there is a motion; the fecundity of its nature
causes the One to be no longer one, and we, displaying what we call
its parts, consider them each as a unity and make them into
"genera," unaware of our failure to see the whole at once. We
display it, then, in parts, though, unable to restrain their natural
tendency to coalesce, we bring these parts together again, 
resign them
to the whole and allow them to become a unity, or rather to be a
unity.

<P>All this will become clearer in the light of further
consideration- when, that is to say, we have ascertained the 
number of
the genera; for thus we shall also discover their causes. It is not
enough to deny; we must advance by dint of thought and
comprehension. The way is clear:
