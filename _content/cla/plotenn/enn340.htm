<P>21. That this is the phase of the human being in which desire
takes its origin is shown by observation of the different stages of
life; in childhood, youth, maturity, the bodily desires 
differ; health
or sickness also may change them, while the [psychic] faculty is of
course the same through all: the evidence is clear that the 
variety of
desire in the human being results from the fact that he is a 
corporeal
entity, a living body subject to every sort of vicissitude.

<P>The total movement of desire is not always stirred
simultaneously with what we call the impulses to the 
satisfaction even
of the lasting bodily demands; it may refuse assent to the idea of
eating or drinking until reason gives the word: this shows us
desire- the degree of it existing in the living body- advancing
towards some object, with Nature [the lower soul-phase] refusing its
co-operation and approval, and as sole arbiter between what is
naturally fit and unfit, rejecting what does not accord with the
natural need.

<P>We may be told that the changing state of the body is sufficient
explanation of the changing desires in the faculty; but that would
require the demonstration that the changing condition of a given
entity could effect a change of desire in another, in one 
which cannot
itself gain by the gratification; for it is not the desiring faculty
that profits by food, liquid, warmth, movement, or by any relief
from overplenty or any filling of a void; all such services touch
the body only.
