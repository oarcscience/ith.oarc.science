<P>1. We have examined the proposed "ten genera": we have discussed
also the theory which gathers the total of things into one genus and
to this subordinates what may be thought of as its four species. The
next step is, naturally, to expound our own views and to try to show
the agreement of our conclusions with those of Plato.

<P>Now if we were obliged to consider Being as a unity, the 
following
questions would be unnecessary:

<P>Is there one genus embracing everything, or are there 
genera which
cannot be subsumed under such a unity? Are there 
first-principles? Are
first-principles to be identified with genera, or genera with
first-principles? Or is it perhaps rather the case that while not
all genera are first-principles, all first-principles are at the
same time genera? Or is the converse true? Or again, do both classes
overlap, some principles being also genera, and some genera also
principles? And do both the sets of categories we have been
examining imply that only some principles are genera and some genera
principles? or does one of them presuppose that all that belongs to
the class of genera belongs also to the class of principles?

<P>Since, however, we affirm that Being is not a unity- the reason
for this affirmation is stated by Plato and others- these questions
become imperative, once we are satisfied as to the number of 
genera to
be posited and the grounds for our choice.

<P>The subject of our enquiry, then, is the Existent or Existents,
and it presents immediately two problems demanding separate analysis:

<P>What do we mean by the Existent? This is naturally the first
question to be examined.

<P>What is that which, often taken for Being [for the Existent], is
in our view Becoming and never really Being? Note however that these
concepts are not to be taken as distinguished from each other in the
sense of belonging to a genus, Something, divided into Being and
Becoming; and we must not suppose that Plato took this view. It
would be absurd to assign Being to the same genus as non-Being: this
would be to make one genus of Socrates and his portrait. The
division here [between what has Being and what is in 
Becoming] means a
definite marking-off, a setting asunder, leading to the 
assertion that
what takes the appearance of Being is not Being and implying that
the nature of True Being has been quite misapprehended. Being, we
are taught, must have the attribute of eternity, must be so
constituted as never to belie its own nature.

<P>This, then, is the Being of which we shall treat, and in our
investigation we shall assume that it is not a unity: subsequently
we ask leave to say something on the nature of Becoming and 
on what it
is that comes to be, that is, on the nature of the world of Sense.
