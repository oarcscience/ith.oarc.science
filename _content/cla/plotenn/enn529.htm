<P>23. As for Possession, if the term is used comprehensively, why
are not all its modes to be brought under one category? Possession,
thus, would include the quantum as possessing magnitude, the quale
as possessing colour; it would include fatherhood and the
complementary relationships, since the father possesses the son and
the son possesses the father: in short, it would include all
belongings.

<P>If, on the contrary, the category of Possession 
comprises only the
things of the body, such as weapons and shoes, we first ask why this
should be so, and why their possession produces a single category,
while burning, cutting, burying or casting them out do not give
another or others. If it is because these things are carried on the
person, then one's mantle lying on a couch will come under a 
different
category from that of the mantle covering the person. If the 
ownership
of possession suffices, then clearly one must refer to the one
category of Possession all objects identified by being possessed,
every case in which possession can be established; the character of
the possessed object will make no difference.

<P>If however Possession is not to be predicated of Quality because
Quality stands recognised as a category, nor of Quantity because the
category of Quantity has been received, nor of parts because 
they have
been assigned to the category of Substance, why should we predicate
Possession of weapons, when they too are comprised in the accepted
category of Substance? Shoes and weapons are clearly substances.

<P>How, further, is "He possesses weapons," signifying as it does
that the action of arming has been performed by a subject, to be
regarded as an entirely simple notion, assignable to a single
category?

<P>Again, is Possession to be restricted to an animate possessor,
or does it hold good even of a statue as possessing the objects
above mentioned? The animate and inanimate seem to possess in
different ways, and the term is perhaps equivocal. Similarly,
"standing" has not the same connotation as applied to the animate
and the inanimate.

<P>Besides, how can it be reasonable for what is found only in a
limited number of cases to form a distinct generic category?
