<P>8. But what must we do? How lies the path? How come to vision of
the inaccessible Beauty, dwelling as if in consecrated precincts,
apart from the common ways where all may see, even the profane?

<P>He that has the strength, let him arise and withdraw 
into himself,
foregoing all that is known by the eyes, turning away for ever from
the material beauty that once made his joy. When he perceives those
shapes of grace that show in body, let him not pursue: he must know
them for copies, vestiges, shadows, and hasten away towards That
they tell of. For if anyone follow what is like a beautiful shape
playing over water- is there not a myth telling in symbol of such a
dupe, how he sank into the depths of the current and was 
swept away to
nothingness? So too, one that is held by material beauty and will
not break free shall be precipitated, not in body but in 
Soul, down to
the dark depths loathed of the Intellective-Being, where, blind even
in the Lower-World, he shall have commerce only with 
shadows, there as
here.

<P>"Let us flee then to the beloved Fatherland": this is 
the soundest
counsel. But what is this flight? How are we to gain the 
open sea? For
Odysseus is surely a parable to us when he commands the flight from
the sorceries of Circe or Calypso- not content to linger for all the
pleasure offered to his eyes and all the delight of sense filling
his days.

<P>The Fatherland to us is There whence we have come, and There is
The Father.

<P>What then is our course, what the manner of our flight? This is
not a journey for the feet; the feet bring us only from land to
land; nor need you think of coach or ship to carry you away; all
this order of things you must set aside and refuse to see: you must
close the eyes and call instead upon another vision which is to be
waked within you, a vision, the birth-right of all, which few turn
to use.
