<P>3. Thus there is in the Nature-Principle itself an Ideal 
archetype
of the beauty that is found in material forms and, of that archetype
again, the still more beautiful archetype in Soul, source of that in
Nature. In the proficient soul this is brighter and of more advanced
loveliness: adorning the soul and bringing to it a light from that
greater light which is beauty primally, its immediate presence sets
the soul reflecting upon the quality of this prior, the archetype
which has no such entries, and is present nowhere but remains in
itself alone, and thus is not even to be called a 
Reason-Principle but
is the creative source of the very first Reason-Principle 
which is the
Beauty to which Soul serves as Matter.

<P>This prior, then, is the Intellectual-Principle, the veritable,
abiding and not fluctuant since not taking intellectual quality from
outside itself. By what image thus, can we represent it? We have
nowhere to go but to what is less. Only from itself can we take an
image of it; that is, there can be no representation of it, except
in the sense that we represent gold by some portion of gold- 
purified,
either actually or mentally, if it be impure- insisting at the same
time that this is not the total thing-gold, but merely the
particular gold of a particular parcel. In the same way we learn in
this matter from the purified Intellect in ourselves or, if you
like, from the Gods and the glory of the Intellect in them.

<P>For assuredly all the Gods are august and beautiful in a beauty
beyond our speech. And what makes them so? Intellect; and especially
Intellect operating within them [the divine sun and stars] to
visibility. It is not through the loveliness of their 
corporeal forms:
even those that have body are not gods by that beauty; it is 
in virtue
of Intellect that they, too, are gods, and as gods beautiful. They
do not veer between wisdom and folly: in the immunity of Intellect
unmoving and pure, they are wise always, all-knowing, taking
cognisance not of the human but of their own being and of all that
lies within the contemplation of Intellect. Those of them whose
dwelling is in the heavens, are ever in this meditation- what task
prevents them?- and from afar they look, too, into that 
further heaven
by a lifting of the head. The Gods belonging to that higher Heaven
itself, they whose station is upon it and in it, see and know in
virtue of their omnipresence to it. For all There is heaven; earth
is heaven, and sea heaven; and animal and plant and man; all is the
heavenly content of that heaven: and the Gods in it, 
despising neither
men nor anything else that is there where all is of the heavenly
order, traverse all that country and all space in peace.
