<P>24. Now comes the question of the soul leaving the body; where
does it go?

<P>It cannot remain in this world where there is no natural 
recipient
for it; and it cannot remain attached to anything not of a character
to hold it: it can be held here when only it is less than wise,
containing within itself something of that which lures it.

<P>If it does contain any such alien element it gives itself, with
increasing attachment, to the sphere to which that element naturally
belongs and tends.

<P>The space open to the soul's resort is vast and diverse; the
difference will come by the double force of the individual condition
and of the justice reigning in things. No one can ever escape the
suffering entailed by ill deeds done: the divine law is ineluctable,
carrying bound up, as one with it, the fore-ordained execution of
its doom. The sufferer, all unaware, is swept onward towards his
due, hurried always by the restless driving of his errors, until at
last wearied out by that against which he struggled, he 
falls into his
fit place and, by self-chosen movement, is brought to the 
lot he never
chose. And the law decrees, also, the intensity and the duration of
the suffering while it carries with it, too, the lifting of
chastisement and the faculty of rising from those places of pain-
all by power of the harmony that maintains the universal scheme.

<P>Souls, body-bound, are apt to body-punishment; clean souls no
longer drawing to themselves at any point any vestige of body are,
by their very being, outside the bodily sphere; body-free,
containing nothing of body- there where Essence is, and 
Being, and the
Divine within the Divinity, among Those, within That, such a 
soul must
be.

<P>If you still ask Where, you must ask where those Beings are- and
in your seeking, seek otherwise than with the sight, and not as one
seeking for body.
