<P>7. It is inevitably necessary to think of all as contained
within one nature; one nature must hold and encompass all; there
cannot be as in the realm of sense thing apart from thing, here a
sun and elsewhere something else; all must be mutually present
within a unity. This is the very nature of the
Intellectual-Principle as we may know from soul which reproduces it
and from what we call Nature under which and by which the things of
process are brought into their disjointed being while that Nature
itself remains indissolubly one.

<P>But within the unity There, the several entities have 
each its own
distinct existence; the all-embracing Intellect sees what is in it,
what is within Being; it need not look out upon them since 
it contains
them, need not separate them since they stand for ever 
distinct within
it.

<P>Against doubters we cite the fact of participation; the
greatness and beauty of the Intellectual-Principle we know by the
soul's longing towards it; the longing of the rest towards 
soul is set
up by its likeness to its higher and to the possibility open to them
of attaining resemblance through it.

<P>It is surely inconceivable that any living thing be beautiful
failing a Life-Absolute of a wonderful, an ineffable, beauty: this
must be the Collective Life, made up of all living things, or
embracing all, forming a unity coextensive with all, as our universe
is a unity embracing all the visible.
