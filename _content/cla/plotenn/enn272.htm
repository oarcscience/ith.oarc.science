<P>7. Certain Principles, then, we may take to be established- some
self-evident, others brought out by our treatment above:

<P>All the forms of Authentic Existence spring from vision and are
a vision. Everything that springs from these Authentic Existences in
their vision is an object of vision-manifest to sensation or to true
knowledge or to surface-awareness. All act aims at this knowing; all
impulse is towards knowledge, all that springs from vision exists to
produce Ideal-Form, that is a fresh object of vision, so that
universally, as images of their engendering principles, they all
produce objects of vision, Ideal-forms. In the engendering of these
sub-existences, imitations of the Authentic, it is made manifest
that the creating powers operate not for the sake of creation and
action but in order to produce an object of vision. This same vision
is the ultimate purpose of all the acts of the mind and, even
further downward, of all sensation, since sensation also is an
effort towards knowledge; lower still, Nature, producing 
similarly its
subsequent principle, brings into being the vision and Idea that we
know in it. It is certain, also, that as the Firsts exist in vision
all other things must be straining towards the same condition; the
starting point is, universally, the goal.

<P>When living things reproduce their Kind, it is that the
Reason-Principles within stir them; the procreative act is the
expression of a contemplation, a travail towards the creation of
many forms, many objects of contemplation, so that the 
universe may be
filled full with Reason-Principles and that contemplation may be, as
nearly as possible, endless: to bring anything into being is to
produce an Idea-Form and that again is to enrich the universe with
contemplation: all the failures, alike in being and in doing, are
but the swerving of visionaries from the object of vision: in the
end the sorriest craftsman is still a maker of forms, 
ungracefully. So
Love, too, is vision with the pursuit of Ideal-Form.
