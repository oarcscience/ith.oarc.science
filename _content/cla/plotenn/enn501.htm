<P>10. All, then, that is present in the sense realm as Idea comes
from the Supreme. But what is not present as Idea, does not. Thus of
things conflicting with nature, none is There: the inartistic is not
contained in the arts; lameness is not in the seed; for a lame leg
is either inborn through some thwarting of the Reason-principle or
is a marring of the achieved form by accident. To that Intellectual
Kosmos belong qualities, accordant with Nature, and 
quantities; number
and mass; origins and conditions; all actions and experiences not
against nature; movement and repose, both the universals and the
particulars: but There time is replaced by eternity and space by its
intellectual equivalent, mutual inclusiveness.

<P>In that Intellectual Kosmos, where all is one total, every
entity that can be singled out is an intellective essence and a
participant in life: thus, identity and difference, movement and
rest with the object resting or moving, essence and quality, all
have essential existence. For every real being must be in actuality
not merely in potentiality and therefore the nature of each 
essence is
inherent in it.

<P>This suggests the question whether the Intellectual Kosmos
contains the forms only of the things of sense or of other existents
as well. But first we will consider how it stands with artistic
creations: there is no question of an ideal archetype of evil: the
evil of this world is begotten of need, privation, deficiency, and
is a condition peculiar to Matter distressed and to what has 
come into
likeness with Matter.
