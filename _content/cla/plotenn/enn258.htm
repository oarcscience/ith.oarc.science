<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 7</H4>

<P>7. Now comes the question whether, in all this discussion, we
are not merely helping to make out a case for some other order of
Beings and talking of matters alien to ourselves.

<P>But how could that be? What understanding can there be failing
some point of contact? And what contact could there be with the
utterly alien?

<P>We must then have, ourselves, some part or share in Eternity.

<P>Still, how is this possible to us who exist in Time?

<P>The whole question turns on the distinction between being in
Time and being in Eternity, and this will be best realized by
probing to the Nature of Time. We must, therefore, descend from
Eternity to the investigation of Time, to the realm of Time: till
now we have been taking the upward way; we must now take the 
downward-
not to the lowest levels but within the degree in which Time 
itself is
a descent from Eternity.

<P>If the venerable sages of former days had not treated of 
Time, our
method would be to begin by linking to [the idea of] Eternity [the
idea of] its Next [its inevitable downward or outgoing subsequent in
the same order], then setting forth the probable nature of 
such a Next
and proceeding to show how the conception thus formed 
tallies with our
own doctrine.

<P>But, as things are, our best beginning is to range over the most
noteworthy of the ancient opinions and see whether any of them
accord with ours.

<P>Existing explanations of Time seem to fall into three classes:

<P>Time is variously identified with what we know as 
Movement, with a
moved object, and with some phenomenon of Movement: obviously it
cannot be Rest or a resting object or any phenomenon of rest, since,
in its characteristic idea, it is concerned with change.

<P>Of those that explain it as Movement, some identify it with
Absolute Movement [or with the total of Movement], others 
with that of
the All. Those that make it a moved object would identify it with
the orb of the All. Those that conceive it as some 
phenomenon, or some
period, of Movement treat it, severally, either as a standard of
measure or as something inevitably accompanying Movement, abstract
or definite.
