<P>26. But the error in this theory is fundamental. To set 
Matter the
potential above everything, instead of recognising the primacy of
actuality, is in the highest degree perverse. If the potential holds
the primacy among the Existents, its actualization becomes 
impossible;
it certainly cannot bring itself into actuality: either the actual
exists previously, and so the potential is not the first-principle,
or, if the two are to be regarded as existing simultaneously, the
first-principles must be attributed to hazard. Besides, if they are
simultaneous, why is not actuality given the primacy? Why is the
potential more truly real than the actual?

<P>Supposing however that the actual does come later than the
potential, how must the theory proceed? Obviously Matter does not
produce Form: the unqualified does not produce Quality, nor does
actuality take its origin in the potential; for that would mean that
the actual was inherent in the potential, which at once 
becomes a dual
thing.

<P>Furthermore, God becomes a secondary to Matter, inasmuch as even
he is regarded as a body composed of Matter and Form- though how he
acquires the Form is not revealed. If however he be admitted to
exist apart from Matter in virtue of his character as a principle
and a rational law [logos], God will be bodiless, the Creative Power
bodiless. If we are told that he is without Matter but is 
composite in
essence by the fact of being a body, this amounts to introducing
another Matter, the Matter of God.

<P>Again, how can Matter be a first-principle, seeing that it is
body? Body must necessarily be a plurality, since all bodies are
composite of Matter and Quality. If however body in this 
case is to be
understood in some different way, then Matter is identified with
body only by an equivocation.

<P>If the possession of three dimensions is given as the
characteristic of body, then we are dealing simply with mathematical
body. If resistance is added, we are no longer considering a unity:
besides, resistance is a quality or at least derived from Quality.

<P>And whence is this resistance supposed to come? Whence the three
dimensions? What is the source of their existence? Matter is not
comprised in the concept of the three-dimensional, nor the
three-dimensional in the concept of Matter; if Matter 
partakes thus of
extension, it can no longer be a simplex.

<P>Again, whence does Matter derive its unifying power? It is
assuredly not the Absolute Unity, but has only that of participation
in Unity.

<P>We inevitably conclude that Mass or Extension cannot be ranked
as the first of things; Non-Extension and Unity must be 
prior. We must
begin with the One and conclude with the Many, proceed to magnitude
from that which is free from magnitude: a One is necessary to the
existence of a Many, Non-Magnitude to that of Magnitude. Magnitude
is a unity not by being Unity-Absolute, but by participation 
and in an
accidental mode: there must be a primary and absolute preceding the
accidental, or the accidental relation is left unexplained.

<P>The manner of this relation demands investigation. Had this been
undertaken, the thinkers of this school would probably have lighted
upon that Unity which is not accidental but essential and underived.
