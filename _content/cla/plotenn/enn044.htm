<P>12. The pleasure demanded for the life cannot be in the 
enjoyments
of the licentious or in any gratifications of the body- there is no
place for these, and they stifle happiness- nor in any violent
emotions- what could so move the Sage?- it can be only such pleasure
as there must be where Good is, pleasure that does not rise from
movement and is not a thing of process, for all that is good is
immediately present to the Sage and the Sage is present to himself:
his pleasure, his contentment, stands, immovable.

<P>Thus he is ever cheerful, the order of his life ever untroubled:
his state is fixedly happy and nothing whatever of all that is known
as evil can set it awry- given only that he is and remains a Sage.

<P>If anyone seeks for some other kind of pleasure in the 
life of the
Sage, it is not the life of the Sage he is looking for.
