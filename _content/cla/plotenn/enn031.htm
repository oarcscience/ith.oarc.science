<P>6. Philosophy has other provinces, but Dialectic is its precious
part: in its study of the laws of the universe, Philosophy draws on
Dialectic much as other studies and crafts use Arithmetic, though,
of course, the alliance between Philosophy and Dialectic is closer.

<P>And in Morals, too, Philosophy uses Dialectic: by Dialectic it
comes to contemplation, though it originates of itself the 
moral state
or rather the discipline from which the moral state develops.

<P>Our reasoning faculties employ the data of Dialectic almost as
their proper possession for they are mainly concerned about Matter
[whose place and worth Dialectic establishes].

<P>And while the other virtues bring the reason to bear upon
particular experiences and acts, the virtue of Wisdom [i.e., the
virtue peculiarly induced by Dialectic] is a certain super-reasoning
much closer to the Universal; for it deals with correspondence and
sequence, the choice of time for action and inaction, the adoption
of this course, the rejection of that other: Wisdom and 
Dialectic have
the task of presenting all things as Universals and stripped 
of matter
for treatment by the Understanding.

<P>But can these inferior kinds of virtue exist without 
Dialectic and
philosophy?

<P>Yes- but imperfectly, inadequately.

<P>And is it possible to be a Sage, Master in Dialectic, without
these lower virtues?

<P>It would not happen: the lower will spring either before or
together with the higher. And it is likely that everyone normally
possesses the natural virtues from which, when Wisdom steps in, the
perfected virtue develops. After the natural virtues, then, Wisdom
and, so the perfecting of the moral nature. Once the natural virtues
exist, both orders, the natural and the higher, ripen side by side
to their final excellence: or as the one advances it carries forward
the other towards perfection.

<P>But, ever, the natural virtue is imperfect in vision and in
strength- and to both orders of virtue the essential matter is from
what principles we derive them.
