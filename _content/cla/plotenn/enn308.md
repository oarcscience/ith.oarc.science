#### Section 22

22\. May we think that the mode of the soul's presence to body is that
of the presence of light to the air?

This certainly is presence with distinction: the light penetrates
through and through, but nowhere coalesces; the light is the stable
thing, the air flows in and out; when the air passes beyond the lit area
it is dark; under the light it is lit: we have a true parallel to what
we have been saying of body and soul, for the air is in the light quite
as much as the light in the air.

Plato therefore is wise when, in treating of the All, he puts the body
in its soul, and not its soul in the body, and says that, while there is
a region of that soul which contains body, there is another region to
which body does not enter- certain powers, that is, with which body has
no concern. And what is true of the All-Soul is true of the others.

There are, therefore, certain soul-powers whose presence to body must be
denied.

The phases present are those which the nature of body demands: they are
present without being resident- either in any parts of the body or in
the body as a whole.

For the purposes of sensation the sensitive phase of the soul is present
to the entire sensitive being: for the purposes of act, differentiation
begins; every soul phase operates at a point peculiar to itself.
