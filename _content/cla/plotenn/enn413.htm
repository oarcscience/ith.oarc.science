<P>5. How then can a multitude of essential beings be really one?

<P>Obviously either the one essence will be entire in all, or the
many will rise from a one which remains unaltered and yet 
includes the
one- many in virtue of giving itself, without 
self-abandonment, to its
own multiplication.

<P>It is competent thus to give and remain, because while it
penetrates all things it can never itself be sundered: this is an
identity in variety.

<P>There is no reason for dismissing this explanation: we may think
of a science with its constituents standing as one total, the source
of all those various elements: again, there is the seed, a whole,
producing those new parts in which it comes to its division; each of
the new growths is a whole while the whole remains undiminished:
only the material element is under the mode of part, and all the
multiplicity remains an entire identity still.

<P>It may be objected that in the case of science the constituents
are not each the whole.

<P>But even in the science, while the constituent selected for
handling to meet a particular need is present actually and takes the
lead, still all the other constituents accompany it in a potential
presence, so that the whole is in every part: only in this sense [of
particular attention] is the whole science distinguished from the
part: all, we may say, is here simultaneously effected: each part is
at your disposal as you choose to take it; the part invites the
immediate interest, but its value consists in its approach to the
whole.

<P>The detail cannot be considered as something separate from the
entire body of speculation: so treated it would have no technical or
scientific value; it would be childish divagation. The one detail,
when it is a matter of science, potentially includes all. 
Grasping one
such constituent of his science, the expert deduces the rest by
force of sequence.

<P>[As a further illustration of unity in plurality] the
geometrician, in his analysis, shows that the single proposition
includes all the items that go to constitute it and all the
propositions which can be developed from it.

<P>It is our feebleness that leads to doubt in these matters; the
body obscures the truth, but There all stands out clear and separate.
