<P>20. But though not opposed, it is still different from Action
and cannot belong to the same genus as activity; though if they are
both Motion, it will so belong, on the principle that alteration
must be regarded as qualitative motion.

<P>Does it follow that whenever alteration proceeds from Quality,
it will be activity and Action, the quale remaining impassive? It
may be that if the quale remains impassive, the alteration will be
in the category of Action; whereas if, while its energy is directed
outwards, it also suffers- as in beating- it will cease to belong to
that category: or perhaps there is nothing to prevent its being in
both categories at one and the same moment.

<P>If then an alteration be conditioned by Passivity alone, 
as is the
case with rubbing, on what ground is it assigned to Action 
rather than
to Passivity? Perhaps the Passivity arises from the fact that a
counter-rubbing is involved. But are we, in view of this
counter-motion, to recognize the presence of two distinct 
motions? No:
one only.

<P>How then can this one motion be both Action and Passion? We must
suppose it to be Action in proceeding from an object, and Passion in
being directly upon another- though it remains the same motion
throughout.

<P>Suppose however Passion to be a different motion from Action:
how then does its modification of the patient object change that
patient's character without the agent being affected by the patient?
For obviously an agent cannot be passive to the operation it
performs upon another. Can it be that the fact of motion existing
elsewhere creates the Passion, which was not Passion in the agent?

<P>If the whiteness of the swan, produced by its 
Reason-Principle, is
given at its birth, are we to affirm Passion of the swan on its
passing into being? If, on the contrary, the swan grows white after
birth, and if there is a cause of that growth and the corresponding
result, are we to say that the growth is a Passion? Or must 
we confine
Passion to purely qualitative change?

<P>One thing confers beauty and another takes it: is that 
which takes
beauty to be regarded as patient? If then the source of beauty- tin,
suppose- should deteriorate or actually disappear, while the
recipient- copper- improves, are we to think of the copper as
passive and the tin active?

<P>Take the learner: how can he be regarded as passive, seeing that
the Act of the agent passes into him [and becomes his Act]? How can
the Act, necessarily a simple entity, be both Act and Passion? No
doubt the Act is not in itself a Passion; nonetheless, the learner
coming to possess it will be a patient by the fact of his
appropriation of an experience from outside: he will not, of course,
be a patient in the sense of having himself performed no Act;
learning- like seeing- is not analogous to being struck, since it
involves the acts of apprehension and recognition.
