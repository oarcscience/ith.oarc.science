#### Section 8

8\. Soul, then, in the same way, is intent upon a task of its own; alike
in its direct course and in its divagation it is the cause of all by its
possession of the Thought of the First Principle: thus a Law of Justice
goes with all that exists in the Universe which, otherwise, would be
dissolved, and is perdurable because the entire fabric is guided as much
by the orderliness as by the power of the controlling force. And in this
order the stars, as being no minor members of the heavenly system, are
co-operators contributing at once to its stately beauty and to its
symbolic quality. Their symbolic power extends to the entire realm of
sense, their efficacy only to what they patently do.

For our part, nature keeps us upon the work of the Soul as long as we
are not wrecked in the multiplicity of the Universe: once thus sunk and
held we pay the penalty, which consists both in the fall itself and in
the lower rank thus entailed upon us: riches and poverty are caused by
the combinations of external fact.

And what of virtue and vice?

That question has been amply discussed elsewhere: in a word, virtue is
ours by the ancient staple of the Soul; vice is due to the commerce of a
Soul with the outer world.
