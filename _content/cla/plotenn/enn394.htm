<P>11. (16) What intelligent mind can doubt the immortality 
of such a
value, one in which there is a life self-springing and therefore not
to be destroyed?

<P>This is at any rate a life not imported from without, not
present in the mode of the heat in fire- for if heat is 
characteristic
of the fire proper, it certainly is adventitious to the Matter
underlying the fire; or fire, too, would be everlasting- it is not
in any such mode that the soul has life: this is no case of a Matter
underlying and a life brought into that Matter and making it 
into soul
[as heat comes into matter and makes it fire].

<P>Either life is Essential Reality, and therefore self-living- the
very thing we have been seeking- and undeniably immortal: or it,
too, is a compound and must be traced back through all the
constituents until an immortal substance is reached, something
deriving movement from itself, and therefore debarred from accepting
death.

<P>Even supposing life could be described as a condition 
imposed upon
Matter, still the source from which this condition entered the
Matter must necessarily be admitted to be immortal simply by being
unable to take into itself the opposite of the life which it conveys.

<P>Of course, life is no such mere condition, but an independent
principle, effectively living.
