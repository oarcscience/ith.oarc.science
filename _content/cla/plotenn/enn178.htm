<P>3. "Atoms" or "elements"- it is in either case an absurdity, an
impossibility, to hand over the universe and its contents to
material entities, and out of the disorderly swirl thus occasioned
to call order, reasoning, and the governing soul into being; but the
atomic origin is, if we may use the phrase, the most impossible.

<P>A good deal of truth has resulted from the discussion of this
subject; but, even to admit such principles does not compel us to
admit universal compulsion or any kind of "fate."

<P>Suppose the atoms to exist:

<P>These atoms are to move, one downwards- admitting a down and an
up- another slant-wise, all at haphazard, in a confused conflict.
Nothing here is orderly; order has not come into being, though the
outcome, this Universe, when it achieves existence, is all order;
and thus prediction and divination are utterly impossible, whether
by the laws of the science- what science can operate where 
there is no
order?- or by divine possession and inspiration, which no 
less require
that the future be something regulated.

<P>Material entities exposed to all this onslaught may very well be
under compulsion to yield to whatsoever the atoms may bring: 
but would
anyone pretend that the acts and states of a soul or mind could be
explained by any atomic movements? How can we imagine that the
onslaught of an atom, striking downwards or dashing in from any
direction, could force the soul to definite and necessary reasonings
or impulses or into any reasonings, impulses or thoughts at all,
necessary or otherwise? And what of the soul's resistance to bodily
states? What movement of atoms could compel one man to be a
geometrician, set another studying arithmetic or astronomy, lead a
third to the philosophic life? In a word, if we must go, 
like soulless
bodies, wherever bodies push and drive us, there is an end to our
personal act and to our very existence as living beings.

<P>The School that erects other material forces into 
universal causes
is met by the same reasoning: we say that while these can warm us
and chill us, and destroy weaker forms of existence, they can be
causes of nothing that is done in the sphere of mind or 
soul: all this
must be traceable to quite another kind of Principle.
