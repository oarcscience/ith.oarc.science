<P>16. On the other hand, to despise this Sphere, and the 
Gods within
it or anything else that is lovely, is not the way to goodness.

<P>Every evil-doer began by despising the Gods; and one not
previously corrupt, taking to this contempt, even though in other
respects not wholly bad, becomes an evil-doer by the very fact.

<P>Besides, in this slighting of the Mundane Gods and the world,
the honour they profess for the gods of the Intellectual Sphere
becomes an inconsistency; Where we love, our hearts are warm also to
the Kin of the beloved; we are not indifferent to the children of
our friend. Now every Soul is a child of that Father; but in the
heavenly bodies there are Souls, intellective, holy, much closer to
the Supernal Beings than are ours; for how can this Kosmos be a
thing cut off from That and how imagine the gods in it to 
stand apart?

<P>But of this matter we have treated elsewhere: here we urge that
where there is contempt for the Kin of the Supreme the knowledge of
the Supreme itself is merely verbal.

<P>What sort of piety can make Providence stop short of earthly
concerns or set any limit whatsoever to it?

<P>And what consistency is there in this school when they proceed
to assert that Providence cares for them, though for them alone?

<P>And is this Providence over them to be understood of their
existence in that other world only or of their lives here as well?
If in the other world, how came they to this? If in this world, why
are they not already raised from it?

<P>Again, how can they deny that the Lord of Providence is here?
How else can He know either that they are here, or that in their
sojourn here they have not forgotten Him and fallen away? 
And if He is
aware of the goodness of some, He must know of the wickedness of
others, to distinguish good from bad. That means that He is 
present to
all, is, by whatever mode, within this Universe. The Universe,
therefore, must be participant in Him.

<P>If He is absent from the Universe, He is absent from yourselves,
and you can have nothing to tell about Him or about the powers that
come after Him.

<P>But, allowing that a Providence reaches to you from the world
beyond- making any concession to your liking- it remains 
none the less
certain that this world holds from the Supernal and is not deserted
and will not be: a Providence watching entires is even more likely
than one over fragments only; and similarly, Participation is more
perfect in the case of the All-Soul- as is shown, further, 
by the very
existence of things and the wisdom manifest in their existence. Of
those that advance these wild pretensions, who is so well ordered,
so wise, as the Universe? The comparison is laughable, utterly out
of place; to make it, except as a help towards truth, would be
impiety.

<P>The very question can be entertained by no intelligent being but
only by one so blind, so utterly devoid of perception and thought,
so far from any vision of the Intellectual Universe as not 
even to see
this world of our own.

<P>For who that truly perceives the harmony of the 
Intellectual Realm
could fail, if he has any bent towards music, to answer to 
the harmony
in sensible sounds? What geometrician or arithmetician could fail to
take pleasure in the symmetries, correspondences and principles of
order observed in visible things? Consider, even, the case of
pictures: those seeing by the bodily sense the productions of the
art of painting do not see the one thing in the one only 
way; they are
deeply stirred by recognizing in the objects depicted to the eyes
the presentation of what lies in the idea, and so are called to
recollection of the truth- the very experience out of which Love
rises. Now, if the sight of Beauty excellently reproduced upon a
face hurries the mind to that other Sphere, surely no one seeing the
loveliness lavish in the world of sense- this vast orderliness, the
Form which the stars even in their remoteness display- no 
one could be
so dull-witted, so immoveable, as not to be carried by all this to
recollection, and gripped by reverent awe in the thought of all
this, so great, sprung from that greatness. Not to answer thus could
only be to have neither fathomed this world nor had any 
vision of that
other.
