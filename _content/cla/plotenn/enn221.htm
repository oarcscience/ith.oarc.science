<P>1. What is Love? A God, a Celestial Spirit, a state of 
mind? Or is
it, perhaps, sometimes to be thought of as a God or Spirit and
sometimes merely as an experience? And what is it essentially in
each of these respects?

<P>These important questions make it desirable to review prevailing
opinions on the matter, the philosophical treatment it has received
and, especially, the theories of the great Plato who has 
many passages
dealing with Love, from a point of view entirely his own.

<P>Plato does not treat of it as simply a state observed in 
Souls; he
also makes it a Spirit-being so that we read of the birth of Eros,
under definite circumstances and by a certain parentage.

<P>Now everyone recognizes that the emotional state for 
which we make
this "Love" responsible rises in souls aspiring to be knit in the
closest union with some beautiful object, and that this aspiration
takes two forms, that of the good whose devotion is for 
beauty itself,
and that other which seeks its consummation in some vile 
act. But this
generally admitted distinction opens a new question: we need a
philosophical investigation into the origin of the two phases.

<P>It is sound, I think, to find the primal source of Love in a
tendency of the Soul towards pure beauty, in a recognition, in a
kinship, in an unreasoned consciousness of friendly 
relation. The vile
and ugly is in clash, at once, with Nature and with God: Nature
produces by looking to the Good, for it looks towards Order- 
which has
its being in the consistent total of the good, while the unordered
is ugly, a member of the system of evil- and besides Nature itself,
clearly, springs from the divine realm, from Good and 
Beauty; and when
anything brings delight and the sense of kinship, its very image
attracts.

<P>Reject this explanation, and no one can tell how the mental
state rises and where are its causes: it is the explanation of even
copulative love which is the will to beget in beauty; Nature seeks
to produce the beautiful and therefore by all reason cannot desire
to procreate in the ugly.

<P>Those that desire earthly procreation are satisfied with the
beauty found on earth, the beauty of image and of body; it is
because they are strangers to the Archetype, the source of even the
attraction they feel towards what is lovely here. There are Souls to
whom earthly beauty is a leading to the memory of that in the higher
realm and these love the earthly as an image; those that have not
attained to this memory do not understand what is happening within
them, and take the image for the reality. Once there is perfect
self-control, it is no fault to enjoy the beauty of earth; where
appreciation degenerates into carnality, there is sin.

<P>Pure Love seeks the beauty alone, whether there is 
Reminiscence or
not; but there are those that feel, also, a desire of such 
immortality
as lies within mortal reach; and these are seeking Beauty in their
demand for perpetuity, the desire of the eternal; Nature teaches
them to sow the seed and to beget in beauty, to sow towards
eternity, but in beauty through their own kinship with the
beautiful. And indeed the eternal is of the one stock with the
beautiful, the Eternal-Nature is the first shaping of beauty 
and makes
beautiful all that rises from it.

<P>The less the desire for procreation, the greater is the
contentment with beauty alone, yet procreation aims at the 
engendering
of beauty; it is the expression of a lack; the subject is 
conscious of
insufficiency and, wishing to produce beauty, feels that the 
way is to
beget in a beautiful form. Where the procreative desire is lawless
or against the purposes of nature, the first inspiration has been
natural, but they have diverged from the way, they have slipped and
fallen, and they grovel; they neither understand whither Love sought
to lead them nor have they any instinct to production; they have not
mastered the right use of the images of beauty; they do not know
what the Authentic Beauty is.

<P>Those that love beauty of person without carnal desire love for
beauty's sake; those that have- for women, of course- the copulative
love, have the further purpose of self-perpetuation: as long as they
are led by these motives, both are on the right path, though 
the first
have taken the nobler way. But, even in the right, there is the
difference that the one set, worshipping the beauty of earth, look
no further, while the others, those of recollection, 
venerate also the
beauty of the other world while they, still, have no 
contempt for this
in which they recognize, as it were, a last outgrowth, an
attenuation of the higher. These, in sum, are innocent frequenters
of beauty, not to be confused with the class to whom it becomes an
occasion of fall into the ugly- for the aspiration towards a good
degenerates into an evil often.

<P>So much for love, the state.

<P>Now we have to consider Love, the God.
