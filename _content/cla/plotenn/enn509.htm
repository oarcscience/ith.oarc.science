<P>2. But are we really obliged to posit the existence of such
genera?

<P>Take Substance, for Substance must certainly be our
starting-point: what are the grounds for regarding Substance as one
single genus?

<P>It has been remarked that Substance cannot be a single entity
common to both the Intellectual and the Sensible worlds. We may add
that such community would entail the existence of something prior to
Intellectual and Sensible Substances alike, something distinct from
both as predicated of both; and this prior would be neither body nor
unembodied; for it were one or the other, body would be 
unembodied, or
the unembodied would be the body.

<P>This conclusion must not however prevent our seeking in 
the actual
substance of the Sensible world an element held in common by Matter,
by Form and by their Composite, all of which are designated as
substances, though it is not maintained that they are Substance in
an equal degree; Form is usually held to be Substance in a higher
degree than Matter, and rightly so, in spite of those who would have
Matter to be the more truly real.

<P>There is further the distinction drawn between what are known as
First and Second Substances. But what is their common basis, seeing
that the First are the source from which the Second derive 
their right
to be called substances?

<P>But, in sum, it is impossible to define Substance: determine its
property, and still you have not attained to its essence. Even the
definition, "That which, numerically one and the same, is 
receptive of
contraries," will hardly be applicable to all substances alike.
