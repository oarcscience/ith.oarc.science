<P>4. That water extinguishes fire and fire consumes other things
should not astonish us. The thing destroyed derived its being from
outside itself: this is no case of a self-originating substance
being annihilated by an external; it rose on the ruin of something
else, and thus in its own ruin it suffers nothing strange; and for
every fire quenched, another is kindled.

<P>In the immaterial heaven every member is unchangeably itself for
ever; in the heavens of our universe, while the whole has life
eternally and so too all the nobler and lordlier components, 
the Souls
pass from body to body entering into varied forms- and, when 
it may, a
Soul will rise outside of the realm of birth and dwell with the one
Soul of all. For the embodied lives by virtue of a Form or Idea:
individual or partial things exist by virtue of Universals; 
from these
priors they derive their life and maintenance, for life here is a
thing of change; only in that prior realm is it unmoving. From that
unchangingness, change had to emerge, and from that self-cloistered
Life its derivative, this which breathes and stirs, the 
respiration of
the still life of the divine.

<P>The conflict and destruction that reign among living beings are
inevitable, since things here are derived, brought into existence
because the Divine Reason which contains all of them in the upper
Heavens- how could they come here unless they were There?- must
outflow over the whole extent of Matter.

<P>Similarly, the very wronging of man by man may be derived from
an effort towards the Good; foiled, in their weakness, of their true
desire, they turn against each other: still, when they do wrong,
they pay the penalty- that of having hurt their Souls by their evil
conduct and of degradation to a lower place- for nothing can ever
escape what stands decreed in the law of the Universe.

<P>This is not to accept the idea, sometimes urged, that order is
an outcome of disorder and law of lawlessness, as if evil were a
necessary preliminary to their existence or their manifestation: on
the contrary order is the original and enters this sphere as imposed
from without: it is because order, law and reason exist that 
there can
be disorder; breach of law and unreason exist because Reason exists-
not that these better things are directly the causes of the bad but
simply that what ought to absorb the Best is prevented by its own
nature, or by some accident, or by foreign interference. An entity
which must look outside itself for a law, may be foiled of 
its purpose
by either an internal or an external cause; there will be 
some flaw in
its own nature, or it will be hurt by some alien influence, for
often harm follows, unintended, upon the action of others in the
pursuit of quite unrelated aims. Such living beings, on the other
hand, as have freedom of motion under their own will sometimes take
the right turn, sometimes the wrong.

<P>Why the wrong course is followed is scarcely worth enquiring: a
slight deviation at the beginning develops with every advance into a
continuously wider and graver error- especially since there is the
attached body with its inevitable concomitant of desire- and 
the first
step, the hasty movement not previously considered and not 
immediately
corrected, ends by establishing a set habit where there was at first
only a fall.

<P>Punishment naturally follows: there is no injustice in a man
suffering what belongs to the condition in which he is; nor 
can we ask
to be happy when our actions have not earned us happiness; the good,
only, are happy; divine beings are happy only because they are good.
