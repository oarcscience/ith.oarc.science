<P>23. A first principle is that the knowing of sensible objects is
an act of the soul, or of the living conjoint, becoming aware of the
quality of certain corporeal entities, and appropriating the ideas
present in them.

<P>This apprehension must belong either to the soul isolated,
self-acting, or to soul in conjunction with some other entity.

<P>Isolated, self-acting, how is it possible? Self-acting, it has
knowledge of its own content, and this is not perception but
intellection: if it is also to know things outside itself it 
can grasp
them only in one of two ways: either it must assimilate itself to
the external objects, or it must enter into relations with something
that has been so assimilated.

<P>Now as long as it remains self-centred it cannot assimilate: a
single point cannot assimilate itself to an external line: even line
cannot adapt itself to line in another order, line of the 
intellectual
to line of the sensible, just as fire of the intellectual and man of
the intellectual remain distinct from fire and man of the sensible.
Even Nature, the soul-phase which brings man into being, 
does not come
to identity with the man it shapes and informs: it has the faculty
of dealing with the sensible, but it remains isolated, and, its task
done, ignores all but the intellectual as it is itself ignored by
the sensible and utterly without means of grasping it.

<P>Suppose something visible lying at a distance: the soul sees it;
now, admitting to the full that at first only the pure idea of the
thing is seized- a total without discerned part- yet in the end it
becomes to the seeing soul an object whose complete detail of colour
and form is known: this shows that there is something more here than
the outlying thing and the soul; for the soul is immune from
experience; there must be a third, something not thus exempt; and it
is this intermediate that accepts the impressions of shape and the
like.

<P>This intermediate must be able to assume the modifications of
the material object so as to be an exact reproduction of its states,
and it must be of the one elemental-stuff: it, thus, will exhibit
the condition which the higher principle is to perceive; and the
condition must be such as to preserve something of the originating
object, and yet not be identical with it: the essential vehicle of
knowledge is an intermediary which, as it stands between the soul
and the originating object, will, similarly, present a condition
midway between the two spheres, of sense and the
intellectual-linking the extremes, receiving from one side to
exhibit to the other, in virtue of being able to assimilate itself
to each. As an instrument by which something is to receive
knowledge, it cannot be identical with either the knower or 
the known:
but it must be apt to likeness with both- akin to the external
object by its power of being affected, and to the internal, the
knower, by the fact that the modification it takes becomes an idea.

<P>If this theory of ours is sound, bodily organs are necessary to
sense-perception, as is further indicated by the reflection that the
soul entirely freed of body can apprehend nothing in the order of
sense.

<P>The organ must be either the body entire or some member set
apart for a particular function; thus touch for one, vision for
another. The tools of craftsmanship will be seen to be
intermediaries between the judging worker and the judged object,
disclosing to the experimenter the particular character of the
matter under investigation: thus a ruler, representing at once the
straightness which is in the mind and the straightness of a plank,
is used as an intermediary by which the operator proves his work.

<P>Some questions of detail remain for consideration 
elsewhere: Is it
necessary that the object upon which judgement or perception is to
take place should be in contact with the organ of perception, or can
the process occur across space upon an object at a distance? Thus,
is the heat of a fire really at a distance from the flesh it warms,
the intermediate space remaining unmodified; is it possible to see
colour over a sheer blank intervening between the colour and the
eye, the organ of vision reaching to its object by its own power?

<P>For the moment we have one certainty, that perception of 
things of
sense belongs to the embodied soul and takes place through the body.
