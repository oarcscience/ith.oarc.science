<P>9. Anaxagoras, again, in his assertion of a Mind pure 
and unmixed,
affirms a simplex First and a sundered One, though writing 
long ago he
failed in precision.

<P>Heraclitus, with his sense of bodily forms as things of
ceaseless process and passage, knows the One as eternal and
intellectual.

<P>In Empedocles, similarly, we have a dividing principle,
"Strife," set against "Friendship"- which is The One and is to him
bodiless, while the elements represent Matter.

<P>Later there is Aristotle; he begins by making the First
transcendent and intellective but cancels that primacy by 
supposing it
to have self-intellection. Further he affirms a multitude of other
intellective beings- as many indeed as there are orbs in the
heavens; one such principle as in- over to every orb- and thus his
account of the Intellectual Realm differs from Plato's and, failing
reason, he brings in necessity; though whatever reasons he 
had alleged
there would always have been the objection that it would be more
reasonable that all the spheres, as contributory to one 
system, should
look to a unity, to the First.

<P>We are obliged also to ask whether to Aristotle's mind all
Intellectual Beings spring from one, and that one their First; or
whether the Principles in the Intellectual are many.

<P>If from one, then clearly the Intellectual system will be
analogous to that of the universe of sense-sphere encircling sphere,
with one, the outermost, dominating all- the First [in the
Intellectual] will envelop the entire scheme and will be an
Intellectual [or Archetypal] Kosmos; and as in our universe the
spheres are not empty but the first sphere is thick with stars and
none without them, so, in the Intellectual Kosmos, those 
principles of
Movement will envelop a multitude of Beings, and that world will be
the realm of the greater reality.

<P>If on the contrary each is a principle, then the effective
powers become a matter of chance; under what compulsion are they to
hold together and act with one mind towards that work of unity, the
harmony of the entire heavenly system? Again what can make it
necessary that the material bodies of the heavenly system be equal
in number to the Intellectual moving principles, and how can these
incorporeal Beings be numerically many when there is no Matter to
serve as the basis of difference?

<P>For these reasons the ancient philosophers that ranged
themselves most closely to the school of Pythagoras and of his later
followers and to that of Pherekudes, have insisted upon this Nature,
some developing the subject in their writings while others treated
of it merely in unwritten discourses, some no doubt ignoring it
entirely.
