<P>2. It can be demonstrated that soul must, necessarily, be of
just this nature and that there can be no other soul than such a
being, one neither wholly partible but both at once.

<P>If it had the nature of body it would consist of isolated
members each unaware of the conditions of every other; there would
be a particular soul- say a soul of the finger- answering as a
distinct and independent entity to every local experience; in
general terms, there would be a multiplicity of souls administering
each individual; and, moreover, the universe would be governed not
by one soul but by an incalculable number, each standing apart to
itself. But, without a dominant unity, continuity is meaningless.

<P>The theory that "Impressions reach the leading-principle by
progressive stages" must be dismissed as mere illusion.

<P>In the first place, it affirms without investigation a "leading"
phase of the soul.

<P>What can justify this assigning of parts to the soul, the
distinguishing one part from another? What quantity, or what
difference of quality, can apply to a thing defined as a
self-consistent whole of unbroken unity?

<P>Again, would perception be vested in that leading 
principle alone,
or in the other phases as well?

<P>If a given experience bears only on that "leading principle," it
would not be felt as lodged in any particular members of the 
organism;
if, on the other hand, it fastens on some other phase of the 
soul- one
not constituted for sensation- that phase cannot transmit any
experience to the leading principle, and there can be no sensation.

<P>Again, suppose sensation vested in the 
"leading-principle" itself:
then, a first alternative, it will be felt in some one part of that
[some specifically sensitive phase], the other part excluding a
perception which could serve no purpose; or, in the second
alternative, there will be many distinct sensitive phases, 
an infinite
number, with difference from one to another. In that second case,
one sensitive phase will declare "I had this sensation primarily";
others will have to say "I felt the sensation that rose elsewhere";
but either the site of the experience will be a matter of doubt to
every phase except the first, or each of the parts of the 
soul will be
deceived into allocating the occurrence within its own particular
sphere.

<P>If, on the contrary, the sensation is vested not merely in the
"leading principle," but in any and every part of the soul, what
special function raises the one rather than the other into that
leading rank, or why is the sensation to be referred to it 
rather than
elsewhere? And how, at this, account for the unity of the knowledge
brought in by diverse senses, by eyes, by ears?

<P>On the other hand, if the soul is a perfect unity- 
utterly strange
to part, a self-gathered whole- if it continuously eludes 
all touch of
multiplicity and divisibility- then, no whole taken up into it can
ever be ensouled; soul will stand as circle-centre to every object
[remote on the circumference], and the entire mass of a living being
is soulless still.

<P>There is, therefore, no escape: soul is, in the degree
indicated, one and many, parted and impartible. We cannot 
question the
possibility of a thing being at once a unity and multi-present,
since to deny this would be to abolish the principle which sustains
and administers the universe; there must be a Kind which 
encircles and
supports all and conducts all with wisdom, a principle which is
multiple since existence is multiple, and yet is one soul 
always since
a container must be a unity: by the multiple unity of its nature, it
will furnish life to the multiplicity of the series of an all; by
its impartible unity, it will conduct a total to wise ends.

<P>In the case of things not endowed with intelligence, the
"leading-principle" is their mere unity- a lower reproduction of the
soul's efficiency.

<P>This is the deeper meaning of the profound passage [in the
Timaeus], where we read "By blending the impartible, eternally
unchanging essence with that in division among bodies, he produced a
third form of essence partaking of both qualities."

<P>Soul, therefore, is, in this definite sense, one and many; the
Ideal-Form resident in body is many and one; bodies themselves are
exclusively many; the Supreme is exclusively one.
