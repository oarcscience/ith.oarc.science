<P>3. (A)... How, then, does Unity give rise to Multiplicity?

<P>By its omnipresence: there is nowhere where it is not; it
occupies, therefore, all that is; at once, it is manifold- 
or, rather,
it is all things.

<P>If it were simply and solely everywhere, all would be this one
thing alone: but it is, also, in no place, and this gives, in the
final result, that, while all exists by means of it, in virtue of
its omnipresence, all is distinct from it in virtue of its being
nowhere.

<P>But why is it not merely present everywhere but in addition
nowhere-present?

<P>Because, universality demands a previous unity. It must,
therefore, pervade all things and make all, but not be the universe
which it makes.

<P>(B) The Soul itself must exist as Seeing- with the
Intellectual-Principle as the object of its vision- it is 
undetermined
before it sees but is naturally apt to see: in other words, Soul is
Matter to [its determinant] the Intellectual-Principle.

<P>(C) When we exercise intellection upon ourselves, we are,
obviously, observing an intellective nature, for otherwise we would
not be able to have that intellection.

<P>We know, and it is ourselves that we know; therefore we know the
reality of a knowing nature: therefore, before that intellection in
Act, there is another intellection, one at rest, so to speak.

<P>Similarly, that self-intellection is an act upon a reality and
upon a life; therefore, before the Life and Real-Being concerned in
the intellection, there must be another Being and Life. In a word,
intellection is vested in the activities themselves: since, then,
the activities of self-intellection are intellective-forms, We, the
Authentic We, are the Intelligibles and self-intellection conveys
the Image of the Intellectual Sphere.

<P>(D) The Primal is a potentiality of Movement and of 
Repose- and so
is above and beyond both- its next subsequent has rest and movement
about the Primal. Now this subsequent is the Intellectual-Principle-
so characterized by having intellection of something not identical
with itself whereas the Primal is without intellection. A knowing
principle has duality [that entailed by being the knower of 
something)
and, moreover, it knows itself as deficient since its virtue
consists in this knowing and not in its own bare Being.

<P>(E) In the case of everything which has developed from 
possibility
to actuality the actual is that which remains self-identical for its
entire duration- and this it is which makes perfection possible even
in things of the corporeal order, as for instance in fire but the
actual of this kind cannot be everlasting since [by the fact of
their having once existed only in potentiality] Matter has its place
in them. In anything, on the contrary, not composite [= never
touched by Matter or potentiality] and possessing actuality, that
actual existence is eternal... There is, however, the case, also in
which a thing, itself existing in actuality, stands as 
potentiality to
some other form of Being.

<P>(F)... But the First is not to be envisaged as made up from Gods
of a transcendent order: no; the Authentic Existents constitute the
Intellectual-Principle with Which motion and rest begin. The Primal
touches nothing, but is the centre round which those other Beings
lie in repose and in movement. For Movement is aiming, and the
Primal aims at nothing; what could the Summit aspire to?

<P>Has It, even, no Intellection of Itself?

<P>It possesses Itself and therefore is said in general 
terms to know
itself... But intellection does not mean self-ownership; it means
turning the gaze towards the Primal: now the act of intellection is
itself the Primal Act, and there is therefore no place for 
any earlier
one. The Being projecting this Act transcends the Act so that
Intellection is secondary to the Being in which it resides.
Intellection is not the transcendently venerable thing- neither
Intellection in general nor even the Intellection of The Good. Apart
from and over any Intellection stands The Good itself.

<P>The Good therefore needs no consciousness.

<P>What sort of consciousness can be conceived in it?

<P>Consciousness of the Good as existent or non-existent?

<P>If of existent Good, that Good exists before and without any
such consciousness: if the act of consciousness produces that Good,
then The Good was not previously in existence- and, at once, the
very consciousness falls to the ground since it is, no longer
consciousness of The Good.

<P>But would not all this mean that the First does not even live?

<P>The First cannot be said to live since it is the source of Life.

<P>All that has self-consciousness and self-intellection is
derivative; it observes itself in order, by that activity, to become
master of its Being: and if it study itself this can mean only that
ignorance inheres in it and that it is of its own nature lacking and
to be made perfect by Intellection.

<P>All thinking and knowing must, here, be eliminated: the addition
introduces deprivation and deficiency.
