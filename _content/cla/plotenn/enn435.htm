<P>4. But we, too, are king when we are moulded to the
Intellectual-Principle.

<P>That correspondence may be brought about in two ways: either the
radii from that centre are traced upon us to be our law or we are
filled full of the Divine Mind, which again may have become to us a
thing seen and felt as a presence.

<P>Hence our self-knowing comes to the knowing of all the 
rest of our
being in virtue of this thing patently present; or by that power
itself communicating to us its own power of self-knowing; or by our
becoming identical with that principle of knowledge.

<P>Thus the self-knower is a double person: there is the one that
takes cognisance of the principle in virtue of which understanding
occurs in the soul or mind; and there is the higher, knowing himself
by the Intellectual-Principle with which he becomes identical: this
latter knows the self as no longer man but as a being that has
become something other through and through: he has thrown himself as
one thing over into the superior order, taking with him only that
better part of the soul which alone is winged for the 
Intellectual Act
and gives the man, once established There, the power to appropriate
what he has seen.

<P>We can scarcely suppose this understanding faculty to be unaware
that it has understanding; that it takes cognisance of things
external; that in its judgements it decides by the rules and 
standards
within itself held directly from the Intellectual-Principle; that
there is something higher than itself, something which, moreover, it
has no need to seek but fully possesses. What can we conceive to
escape the self-knowledge of a principle which admittedly knows the
place it holds and the work it has to do? It affirms that it springs
from Intellectual-Principle whose second and image it is, that it
holds all within itself, the universe of things, engraved, so to
say, upon it as all is held There by the eternal engraver. Aware so
far of itself, can it be supposed to halt at that? Are we to suppose
that all we can do is to apply a distinct power of our 
nature and come
thus to awareness of that Intellectual-Principle as aware of itself?
Or may we not appropriate that principle- which belongs to 
us as we to
it- and thus attain to awareness, at once, of it and of ourselves?
Yes: this is the necessary way if we are to experience the
self-knowledge vested in the Intellectual-Principle. And a 
man becomes
Intellectual-Principle when, ignoring all other phases of his being,
he sees through that only and sees only that and so knows himself by
means of the self- in other words attains the self-knowledge 
which the
Intellectual-Principle possesses.
