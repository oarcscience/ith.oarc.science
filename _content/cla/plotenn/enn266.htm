<P>1. Supposing we played a little before entering upon our serious
concern and maintained that all things are striving after
Contemplation, looking to Vision as their one end- and this, not
merely beings endowed with reason but even the unreasoning animals,
the Principle that rules in growing things, and the Earth that
produces these- and that all achieve their purpose in the measure
possible to their kind, each attaining Vision and possessing 
itself of
the End in its own way and degree, some things in entire reality,
others in mimicry and in image- we would scarcely find anyone to
endure so strange a thesis. But in a discussion entirely among
ourselves there is no risk in a light handling of our own ideas.

<P>Well- in the play of this very moment am I engaged in the act of
Contemplation?

<P>Yes; I and all that enter this play are in 
Contemplation: our play
aims at Vision; and there is every reason to believe that child or
man, in sport or earnest, is playing or working only towards Vision,
that every act is an effort towards Vision; the compulsory act,
which tends rather to bring the Vision down to outward 
things, and the
act thought of as voluntary, less concerned with the outer,
originate alike in the effort towards Vision.

<P>The case of Man will be treated later on; let us speak, first,
of the earth and of the trees and vegetation in general, asking
ourselves what is the nature of Contemplation in them, how we relate
to any Contemplative activity the labour and productiveness of the
earth, how Nature, held to be devoid of reason and even of conscious
representation, can either harbour Contemplation or produce by means
of the Contemplation which it does not possess.
