<P>3. But perhaps we should rather speak of some single category,
embracing Intellectual Substance, Matter, Form, and the Composite of
Matter and Form. One might refer to the family of the Heraclids as a
unity in the sense, not of a common element in all its 
members, but of
a common origin: similarly, Intellectual Substance would be
Substance in the first degree, the others being substances by
derivation and in a lower degree.

<P>But what is the objection to including everything in a single
category, all else of which existence is predicated being 
derived from
that one thing, Existence or Substance? Because, granted that things
be no more than modifications of Substance, there is a distinct
grading of substances themselves. Moreover, the single category does
not put us in a position to build on Substance, or to grasp it in
its very truth as the plausible source of the other substances.

<P>Supposing we grant that all things known as substances are
homogeneous as possessing something denied to the other genera, what
precisely is this something, this individuality, this 
subject which is
never a predicate, this thing not present in any thing as in a
subject, this thing which does not owe its essential character to
any other thing, as a quality takes character from a body and a
quantity from a substance, as time is related to motion and motion
to the moved?

<P>The Second Substance is, it is true, a predicate. But
predication in this case signifies a different relation from 
that just
considered; it reveals the genus inherent in the subject and the
subject's essential character, whereas whiteness is predicated of a
thing in the sense of being present in the thing.

<P>The properties adduced may indeed be allowed to distinguish
Substance from the other Existents. They afford a means of grouping
substances together and calling them by a common name. They do not
however establish the unity of a genus, and they do not 
bring to light
the concept and the nature of Substance.

<P>These considerations are sufficient for our purpose: let us now
proceed to investigate the nature of Quantity.
