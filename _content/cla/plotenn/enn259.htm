<P>8. Movement Time cannot be- whether a definite act of moving is
meant or a united total made up of all such acts- since movement, in
either sense, takes place in Time. And, of course, if there is any
movement not in Time, the identification with Time becomes all the
less tenable.

<P>In a word, Movement must be distinct from the medium in which it
takes place.

<P>And, with all that has been said or is still said, one
consideration is decisive: Movement can come to rest, can be
intermittent; Time is continuous.

<P>We will be told that the Movement of the All is 
continuous [and so
may be identical with Time].

<P>But, if the reference is to the Circuit of the heavenly 
system [it
is not strictly continuous, or equable, since] the time taken in the
return path is not that of the outgoing movement; the one is twice
as long as the other: this Movement of the All proceeds, 
therefore, by
two different degrees; the rate of the entire journey is not that of
the first half.

<P>Further, the fact that we hear of the Movement of the outermost
sphere being the swiftest confirms our theory. Obviously, it is the
swiftest of movements by taking the lesser time to traverse the
greater space the very greatest- all other moving things are 
slower by
taking a longer time to traverse a mere segment of the same 
extension:
in other words, Time is not this movement.

<P>And, if Time is not even the movement of the Kosmic Sphere much
less is it the sphere itself though that has been identified 
with Time
on the ground of its being in motion.

<P>Is it, then, some phenomenon or connection of Movement?

<P>Let us, tentatively, suppose it to be extent, or duration, of
Movement.

<P>Now, to begin with, Movement, even continuous, has no unchanging
extent [as Time the equable has], since, even in space, it may be
faster or slower; there must, therefore, be some unit of standard
outside it, by which these differences are measurable, and this
outside standard would more properly be called Time. And failing
such a measure, which extent would be Time, that of the fast 
or of the
slow- or rather which of them all, since these speed-differences are
limitless?

<P>Is it the extent of the subordinate Movement [= movement 
of things
of earth]?

<P>Again, this gives us no unit since the movement is infinitely
variable; we would have, thus, not Time but Times.

<P>The extent of the Movement of the All, then?

<P>The Celestial Circuit may, no doubt, be thought of in terms of
quantity. It answers to measure- in two ways. First there is space;
the movement is commensurate with the area it passes 
through, and this
area is its extent. But this gives us, still, space only, not Time.
Secondly, the circuit, considered apart from distance traversed, has
the extent of its continuity, of its tendency not to stop but to
proceed indefinitely: but this is merely amplitude of 
Movement; search
it, tell its vastness, and, still, Time has no more appeared, no
more enters into the matter, than when one certifies a high pitch of
heat; all we have discovered is Motion in ceaseless succession, like
water flowing ceaselessly, motion and extent of motion.

<P>Succession or repetition gives us Number- dyad, triad, etc.- and
the extent traversed is a matter of Magnitude; thus we have Quantity
of Movement- in the form of number, dyad, triad, decade, or in the
form of extent apprehended in what we may call the amount of the
Movement: but, the idea of Time we have not. That definite 
Quantity is
merely something occurring within Time, for, otherwise Time is not
everywhere but is something belonging to Movement which thus would
be its substratum or basic-stuff: once more, then, we would be
making Time identical with Movement; for the extent of 
Movement is not
something outside it but is simply its continuousness, and 
we need not
halt upon the difference between the momentary and the continuous,
which is simply one of manner and degree. The extended movement and
its extent are not Time; they are in Time. Those that explain Time
as extent of Movement must mean not the extent of the movement
itself but something which determines its extension, something with
which the movement keeps pace in its course. But what this something
is, we are not told; yet it is, clearly, Time, that in which all
Movement proceeds. This is what our discussion has aimed at from the
first: "What, essentially, is Time?" It comes to this: we 
ask "What is
Time?" and we are answered, "Time is the extension of Movement in
Time!"

<P>On the one hand Time is said to be an extension apart from and
outside that of Movement; and we are left to guess what this 
extension
may be: on the other hand, it is represented as the extension of
Movement; and this leaves the difficulty what to make of the 
extension
of Rest- though one thing may continue as long in repose as 
another in
motion, so that we are obliged to think of one thing Time that
covers both Rest and Movements, and, therefore, stands distinct from
either.

<P>What then is this thing of extension? To what order of 
beings does
it belong?

<P>It obviously is not spatial, for place, too, is something
outside it.
