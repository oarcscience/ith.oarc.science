<P>43. And the Proficient [the Sage], how does he stand with regard
to magic and philtre-spells?

<P>In the soul he is immune from magic; his reasoning part cannot
be touched by it, he cannot be perverted. But there is in him the
unreasoning element which comes from the [material] All, and in this
he can be affected, or rather this can be affected in him.
Philtre-Love, however, he will not know, for that would require the
consent of the higher soul to the trouble stiffed in the lower. And,
just as the unreasoning element responds to the call of incantation,
so the adept himself will dissolve those horrible powers by
counter-incantations. Death, disease, any experience within the
material sphere, these may result, yes; for anything that has
membership in the All may be affected by another member, or by the
universe of members; but the essential man is beyond harm.

<P>That the effects of magic should be not instantaneous but
developed is only in accord with Nature's way.

<P>Even the Celestials, the Daimones, are not on their unreasoning
side immune: there is nothing against ascribing acts of memory and
experiences of sense to them, in supposing them to accept 
the traction
of methods laid up in the natural order, and to give hearing to
petitioners; this is especially true of those of them that 
are closest
to this sphere, and in the degree of their concern about it.

<P>For everything that looks to another is under spell to that:
what we look to, draws us magically. Only the self-intent go free of
magic. Hence every action has magic as its source, and the 
entire life
of the practical man is a bewitchment: we move to that only which
has wrought a fascination upon us. This is indicated where we read
"for the burgher of greathearted Erechtheus has a pleasant face [but
you should see him naked; then you would be cautious]." For what
conceivably turns a man to the external? He is drawn, drawn by the
arts not of magicians but of the natural order which administers the
deceiving draught and links this to that, not in local contact but
in the fellowship of the philtre.
