<P>4. We have to enquire into the existence of the Numbers in the
Intellectual. Are they Ideas added to the other Ideas? Or are they
no more than necessary concomitants to the Ideas?

<P>In the latter case, Being, as the first [in the Intellectual]
would give us the conception of the Monad; then since Being produces
motion and rest, Three exists; and so on for all the other members
of the realm of Being. Or perhaps there is one monad for each
member, or a monad for the first, with a dyad for its next, since
there exists a series, and a corresponding number for every 
successive
total, decad for ten, and so on.

<P>If, on the contrary, Number is a direct production of the
Intellectual-Principle [an Idea in itself], there is the question
whether it preceded or followed the other Ideas.

<P>Plato, where he says that men arrived at the conception of
Number by way of the changes of day and night- thus making 
the concept
depend upon variation among things- seems to hold that the things
numerable precede and by their differences produce number: 
Number then
would consist in a process within the human mind passing onwards
from thing to thing; it results by the fact that the mind 
takes count,
that is when the mind traverses things and reports their
differences; observing pure identity unbroken by difference, it says
One. But there is the passage where he tells us that the veritable
Number has Being, is a Being; this is the opposed view that Number
is no product of the reckoning mind but a reality in itself, the
concept of which is reawakened in the mind by changes in things of
sense.
