<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 16</H4>

<P>16. The punishment justly overtaking the wicked must therefore
be ascribed to the kosmic order which leads all in 
accordance with the
right.

<P>But what of chastisements, poverty, illness, falling 
upon the good
outside of all justice? These events, we will be told, are equally
interwoven into the world order and fall under prediction, and must
consequently have a cause in the general reason: are they 
therefore to
be charged to past misdoing?

<P>No: such misfortunes do not answer to reasons established in the
nature of things; they are not laid up in the master-facts of the
universe, but were merely accidental sequents: a house falls, and
anyone that chances to be underneath is killed, no matter 
what sort of
man he be: two objects are moving in perfect order- or one if you
like- but anything getting in the way is wounded or trampled down.
Or we may reason that the undeserved stroke can be no evil to the
sufferer in view of the beneficent interweaving of the All or again,
no doubt, that nothing is unjust that finds justification in a past
history.

<P>We may not think of some things being fitted into a system with
others abandoned to the capricious; if things must happen by 
cause, by
natural sequences, under one Reason-Principle and a single 
set scheme,
we must admit that the minor equally with the major is fitted into
that order and pattern.

<P>Wrong-doing from man to man is wrong in the doer and must be
imputed, but, as belonging to the established order of the 
universe is
not a wrong even as regards the innocent sufferer; it is a thing
that had to be, and, if the sufferer is good, the issue is to his
gain. For we cannot think that this ordered combination proceeds
without God and justice; we must take it to be precise in the
distribution of due, while, yet, the reasons of things elude us, and
to our ignorance the scheme presents matter of censure.
