<P>2. We begin with the soul, asking whether it is to be allowed
self-knowledge and what the knowing principle in it would be and how
operating.

<P>The sense-principle in it we may at once decide, takes
cognisance only of the external; even in any awareness of events
within the body it occupies, this is still the perception of 
something
external to a principle dealing with those bodily conditions not as
within but as beneath itself.

<P>The reasoning-principle in the Soul acts upon the
representations standing before it as the result of
sense-perception; these it judges, combining, distinguishing: or it
may also observe the impressions, so to speak, rising from the
Intellectual-Principle, and has the same power of handling these;
and reasoning will develop to wisdom where it recognizes the new and
late-coming impressions [those of sense] and adapts them, so 
to speak,
to those it holds from long before- the act which may be described
as the soul's Reminiscence.

<P>So far as this, the efficacy of the Intellectual-Principle in
the Soul certainly reaches; but is there also introversion and
self-cognition or is that power to be reserved strictly for 
the Divine
Mind?

<P>If we accord self-knowing to this phase of the soul we make it
an Intellectual-Principle and will have to show what distinguishes
it from its prior; if we refuse it self-knowing, all our thought
brings us step by step to some principle which has this power, and
we must discover what such self-knowing consists in. If, again, we
do allow self-knowledge in the lower we must examine the question of
degree; for if there is no difference of degree, then the reasoning
principle in soul is the Intellectual-Principle unalloyed.

<P>We ask, then, whether the understanding principle in the soul
has equally the power of turning inwards upon itself or 
whether it has
no more than that of comprehending the impressions, superior and
inferior, which it receives.

<P>The first stage is to discover what this comprehension is.
