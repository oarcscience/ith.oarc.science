<P>10. Time, again, has been described as some sort of a sequence
upon Movement, but we learn nothing from this, nothing is said,
until we know what it is that produces this sequential 
thing: probably
the cause and not the result would turn out to be Time.

<P>And, admitting such a thing, there would still remain 
the question
whether it came into being before the movement, with it, or after
it; and, whether we say before or with or after, we are speaking of
order in Time: and thus our definition is "Time is a sequence upon
movement in Time!"

<P>Enough: Our main purpose is to show what Time is, not to refute
false definition. To traverse point by point the many opinions of
our many predecessors would mean a history rather than an
identification; we have treated the various theories as fully as is
possible in a cursory review: and, notice, that which makes Time the
Measure of the All-Movement is refuted by our entire discussion and,
especially, by the observations upon the Measurement of Movement in
general, for all the argument- except, of course, that from
irregularity- applies to the All as much as to particular Movement.

<P>We are, thus, at the stage where we are to state what Time
really is.
