<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 22</H4>

<P>22. We may here adduce the pregnant words of Plato: "Inasmuch as
Intellect perceives the variety and plurality of the Forms present
in the complete Living Being...." The words apply equally to Soul;
Soul is subsequent to Intellect, yet by its very nature it involves
Intellect in itself and perceives more clearly in that 
prior. There is
Intellect in our intellect also, which again perceives more 
clearly in
its prior, for while of itself it merely perceives, in the prior it
also perceives its own perception.

<P>This intellect, then, to which we ascribe perception, though not
divorced from the prior in which it originates, evolves plurality
out of unity and has bound up with it the principle of Difference:
it therefore takes the form of a plurality-in-unity. A
plurality-in-unity, it produces the many intellects by the dictate
of its very nature.

<P>It is certainly no numerical unity, no individual thing; for
whatever you find in that sphere is a species, since it is divorced
from Matter. This may be the import of the difficult words of Plato,
that Substance is broken up into an infinity of parts. So long as
the division proceeds from genus to species, infinity is not
reached; a limit is set by the species generated: the lowest
species, however- that which is not divided into further species-
may be more accurately regarded as infinite. And this is the meaning
of the words: "to relegate them once and for all to infinity 
and there
abandon them." As for particulars, they are, considered in 
themselves,
infinite, but come under number by being embraced by the [total]
unity.

<P>Now Soul has Intellect for its prior, is therefore circumscribed
by number down to its ultimate extremity; at that point infinity is
reached. The particular intellect, though all-embracing, is a
partial thing, and the collective Intellect and its various
manifestations [all the particular intellects] are in actuality
parts of that part. Soul too is a part of a part, though in the
sense of being an Act [actuality] derived from it. When the Act of
Intellect is directed upon itself, the result is the manifold
[particular] intellects; when it looks outwards, Soul is produced.

<P>If Soul acts as a genus or a species, the various [particular]
souls must act as species. Their activities [Acts] will be twofold:
the activity upward is Intellect; that which looks downward
constitutes the other powers imposed by the particular
Reason-Principle [the Reason-Principle of the being ensouled]; the
lowest activity of Soul is in its contact with Matter to which it
brings Form.

<P>This lower part of Soul does not prevent the rest from being
entirely in the higher sphere: indeed what we call the lower part is
but an image of Soul: not that it is cut off from Soul; it 
is like the
reflection in the mirror, depending upon the original which stands
outside of it.

<P>But we must keep in mind what this "outside" means. Up to the
production of the image, the Intellectual realm is wholly and
exclusively composed of Intellectual Beings: in the same way the
Sensible world, representing that in so far as it is able to retain
the likeness of a living being, is itself a living being: 
the relation
is like that of a portrait or reflection to the original which is
regarded as prior to the water or the painting reproducing it.

<P>The representation, notice, in the portrait or on the 
water is not
of the dual being, but of the one element [Matter] as formed by the
other [Soul]. Similarly, this likeness of the Intellectual realm
carries images, not of the creative element, but of the entities
contained in that creator, including Man with every other living
being: creator and created are alike living beings, though of a
different life, and both coexist in the Intellectual realm.
