<P>30. Whether pleasure must enter into the good, so that 
life in the
contemplation of the divine things and especially of their source
remains still imperfect, is a question not to be ignored in any
enquiry into the nature of the good.

<P>Now to found the good upon the Intellect and upon that state of
soul or mind which springs from wisdom does not imply that the end
or the absolute good is the conjunction [of Intellect and state]: it
would follow merely that Intellect is the good and that we feel
happy in possession of that good. That is one theory; another
associates pleasure with Intellect in the sense that the 
Good is taken
to be some one thing founded upon both but depending upon our
attaining or at least contemplating an Intellect so modified; this
theory would maintain that the isolated and unrelated could be the
good, could be an object of desire.

<P>But how could Intellect and pleasure combine into one mutually
complementary nature?

<P>Bodily pleasure no one, certainly, would think capable 
of blending
in with Intellect; the unreasoning satisfactions of soul [or lower
mind] are equally incompatible with it.

<P>Every activity, state, and life, will be followed and as it were
escorted by the over-dwelling consciousness; sometimes as these take
their natural course they will be met by hindrance and by 
intrusion of
the conflicting so that the life is the less self-guided; sometimes
the natural activity is unmixed, wholly free, and then the life
goes brilliantly; this last state is judged the pleasantest, the
most to be chosen; so, for lack of an accurate expression, we hear
of "Intellect in conjunction with pleasure." But this is no more
than metaphor, like a hundred others drawn by the poets from our
natural likings- "Drunk with nectar," "To banquet and feast," "The
Father smiled." No: the veritably pleasant lies away in that other
realm, the most to be loved and sought for, not something brought
about and changing but the very principle of all the colour and
radiance and brightness found here. This is why we read of "Truth
introduced into the Mixture" and of the "measuring standard 
as a prior
condition" and are told that the symmetry and beauty necessary to
the Mixture come Thence into whatever has beauty; it is in this way
that we have our share in Beauty; but in another way, also, 
we achieve
the truly desirable, that is by leading our selves up to what is
best within us; this best is what is symmetry, beauty, collective
Idea, life clear, Intellective and good.
