<P>4. If we had to ascertain the nature of body and the place it
holds in the universe, surely we should take some sample of body,
say stone, and examine into what constituents it may be 
divided. There
would be what we think of as the substrate of stone, its quantity-
in this case, a magnitude; its quality- for example, the colour of
stone. As with stone, so with every other body: we should see that
in this thing, body, there are three distinguishable
characteristics- the pseudo-substance, the quantity, the quality-
though they all make one and are only logically trisected, the three
being found to constitute the unit thing, body. If motion 
were equally
inherent in its constitution, we should include this as well, and
the four would form a unity, the single body depending upon them all
for its unity and characteristic nature.

<P>The same method must be applied in examining the Intellectual
Substance and the genera and first-principles of the Intellectual
sphere.

<P>But we must begin by subtracting what is peculiar to body, its
coming-to-be, its sensible nature, its magnitude- that is to say,
the characteristics which produce isolation and mutual separation.
It is an Intellectual Being we have to consider, an Authentic
Existent, possessed of a unity surpassing that of any sensible thing.

<P>Now the wonder comes how a unity of this type can be many as
well as one. In the case of body it was easy to concede
unity-with-plurality; the one body is divisible to infinity; its
colour is a different thing from its shape, since in fact they are
separated. But if we take Soul, single, continuous, without 
extension,
of the highest simplicity- as the first effort of the mind makes
manifest- how can we expect to find multiplicity here too? 
We believed
that the division of the living being into body and soul was final:
body indeed was manifold, composite, diversified; but in soul we
imagined we had found a simplex, and boldly made a halt, supposing
that we had come to the limit of our course.

<P>Let us examine this soul, presented to us from the Intellectual
realm as body from the Sensible. How is its unity a plurality? How
is its plurality a unity? Clearly its unity is not that of a 
composite
formed from diverse elements, but that of a single nature 
comprising a
plurality.

<P>This problem attacked and solved, the truth about the genera
comprised in Being will thereby, as we asserted, be elucidated also.
