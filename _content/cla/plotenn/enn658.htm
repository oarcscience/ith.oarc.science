<P>20. Since we are not entitled to make desire the test by which
to decide on the nature and quality of the good, we may perhaps have
recourse to judgement.

<P>We would apply the opposition of things- order, disorder;
symmetry, irregularity; health, illness; form, shapelessness;
real-being, decay: in a word continuity against dissolution. 
The first
in each pair, no one could doubt, belong to the concept of good and
therefore whatever tends to produce them must be ranged on the good
side.

<P>Thus virtue and Intellectual-Principle and life and soul-
reasoning soul, at least- belong to the idea of good and so
therefore does all that a reasoned life aims at.

<P>Why not halt, then- it will be asked- at Intellectual-Principle
and make that The Good? Soul and life are traces of
Intellectual-Principle; that principle is the Term of Soul which on
judgement sets itself towards Intellectual-Principle, pronouncing
right preferable to wrong and virtue in every form to vice, and thus
ranking by its choosing.

<P>The soul aiming only at that Principle would need a further
lessoning; it must be taught that Intellectual-Principle is not the
ultimate, that not all things look to that while all do look to the
good. Not all that is outside of Intellectual-Principle seeks to
attain it; what has attained it does not halt there but looks still
towards good. Besides, Intellectual-Principle is sought upon motives
of reasoning, the good before all reason. And in any striving
towards life and continuity of existence and activity, the object is
aimed at not as Intellectual-Principle but as good, as rising from
good and leading to it: life itself is desirable only in 
view of good.
