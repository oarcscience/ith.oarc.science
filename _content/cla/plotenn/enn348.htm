<P>29. But- keeping to our illustration, by which the body is
warmed by soul and not merely illuminated by it- how is it that when
the higher soul withdraws there is no further trace of the vital
principle?

<P>For a brief space there is; and, precisely, it begins to 
fade away
immediately upon the withdrawal of the other, as in the case 
of warmed
objects when the fire is no longer near them: similarly hair 
and nails
still grow on the dead; animals cut to pieces wriggle for a good
time after; these are signs of a life force still indwelling.

<P>Besides, simultaneous withdrawal would not prove the identity of
the higher and lower phases: when the sun withdraws there 
goes with it
not merely the light emanating from it, guided by it, attached to
it, but also at once that light seen upon obliquely situated
objects, a light secondary to the sun's and cast upon things outside
of its path [reflected light showing as colour]; the two are not
identical and yet they disappear together.

<P>But is this simultaneous withdrawal or frank obliteration?

<P>The question applies equally to this secondary light and to the
corporeal life, that life which we think of as being completely sunk
into body.

<P>No light whatever remains in the objects once illuminated; that
much is certain; but we have to ask whether it has sunk back into
its source or is simply no longer in existence.

<P>How could it pass out of being, a thing that once has been?

<P>But what really was it? We must remember that what we know as
colour belongs to bodies by the fact that they throw off light, yet
when corruptible bodies are transformed the colour disappears and we
no more ask where the colour of a burned-out fire is than where its
shape is.

<P>Still: the shape is merely a configuration, like the lie of the
hands clenched or spread; the colour is no such accidental 
but is more
like, for example, sweetness: when a material substance 
breaks up, the
sweetness of what was sweet in it, and the fragrance of what was
fragrant, may very well not be annihilated, but enter into some
other substance, passing unobserved there because the new habitat is
not such that the entrant qualities now offer anything solid to
perception.

<P>May we not think that, similarly, the light belonging to bodies
that have been dissolved remains in being while the solid total,
made up of all that is characteristic, disappears?

<P>It might be said that the seeing is merely the sequel to some
law [of our own nature], so that what we call qualities do not
actually exist in the substances.

<P>But this is to make the qualities indestructible and not 
dependent
upon the composition of the body; it would no longer be the
Reason-Principles within the sperm that produce, for instance, the
colours of a bird's variegated plumage; these principles would
merely blend and place them, or if they produced them would draw
also on the full store of colours in the sky, producing in the
sense, mainly, of showing in the formed bodies something very
different from what appears in the heavens.

<P>But whatever we may think on this doubtful point, if, as long as
the bodies remain unaltered, the light is constant and 
unsevered, then
it would seem natural that, on the dissolution of the body, 
the light-
both that in immediate contact and any other attached to that-
should pass away at the same moment, unseen in the going as in the
coming.

<P>But in the case of the soul it is a question whether the 
secondary
phases follow their priors- the derivatives their sources- or
whether every phase is self-governing, isolated from its
predecessors and able to stand alone; in a word, whether no part of
the soul is sundered from the total, but all the souls are
simultaneously one soul and many, and, if so, by what mode; this
question, however, is treated elsewhere.

<P>Here we have to enquire into the nature and being of that
vestige of the soul actually present in the living body: if there is
truly a soul, then, as a thing never cut off from its total, it will
go with soul as soul must: if it is rather to be thought of as
belonging to the body, as the life of the body, we have the same
question that rose in the case of the vestige of light; we must
examine whether life can exist without the presence of soul, 
except of
course in the sense of soul living above and acting upon the remote
object.
