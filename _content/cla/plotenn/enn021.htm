<P>4. We come, so, to the question whether Purification is the
whole of this human quality, virtue, or merely the forerunner upon
which virtue follows? Does virtue imply the achieved state of
purification or does the mere process suffice to it, Virtue being
something of less perfection than the accomplished pureness which is
almost the Term?

<P>To have been purified is to have cleansed away everything alien:
but Goodness is something more.

<P>If before the impurity entered there was Goodness, the Goodness
suffices; but even so, not the act of cleansing but the 
cleansed thing
that emerges will be The Good. And it remains to establish what this
emergent is.

<P>It can scarcely prove to be The Good: The Absolute Good cannot
be thought to have taken up its abode with Evil. We can think of it
only as something of the nature of good but paying a double 
allegiance
and unable to rest in the Authentic Good.

<P>The Soul's true Good is in devotion to the 
Intellectual-Principle,
its kin; evil to the Soul lies in frequenting strangers. There is no
other way for it than to purify itself and so enter into 
relation with
its own; the new phase begins by a new orientation.

<P>After the Purification, then, there is still this orientation to
be made? No: by the purification the true alignment stands
accomplished.

<P>The Soul's virtue, then, is this alignment? No: it is what the
alignment brings about within.

<P>And this is...?

<P>That it sees; that, like sight affected by the thing seen, the
soul admits the imprint, graven upon it and working within it, of
the vision it has come to.

<P>But was not the Soul possessed of all this always, or had it
forgotten?

<P>What it now sees, it certainly always possessed, but as 
lying away
in the dark, not as acting within it: to dispel the 
darkness, and thus
come to knowledge of its inner content, it must thrust towards the
light.

<P>Besides, it possessed not the originals but images, pictures;
and these it must bring into closer accord with the verities they
represent. And, further, if the Intellectual-Principle is 
said to be a
possession of the Soul, this is only in the sense that It is 
not alien
and that the link becomes very close when the Soul's sight is turned
towards It: otherwise, ever-present though It be, It remains
foreign, just as our knowledge, if it does not determine action, is
dead to us.
