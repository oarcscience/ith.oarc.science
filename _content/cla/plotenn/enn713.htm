<P>10. But how comes the soul not to keep that ground?

<P>Because it has not yet escaped wholly: but there will be the
time of vision unbroken, the self hindered no longer by any
hindrance of body. Not that those hindrances beset that in us which
has veritably seen; it is the other phase of the soul that 
suffers and
that only when we withdraw from vision and take to knowing by proof,
by evidence, by the reasoning processes of the mental habit. Such
logic is not to be confounded with that act of ours in the vision;
it is not our reason that has seen; it is something greater than
reason, reason's Prior, as far above reason as the very 
object of that
thought must be.

<P>In our self-seeing There, the self is seen as belonging to that
order, or rather we are merged into that self in us which has the
quality of that order. It is a knowing of the self restored to its
purity. No doubt we should not speak of seeing; but we cannot help
talking in dualities, seen and seer, instead of, boldly, the
achievement of unity. In this seeing, we neither hold an object nor
trace distinction; there is no two. The man is changed, no longer
himself nor self-belonging; he is merged with the Supreme, 
sunken into
it, one with it: centre coincides with centre, for on this higher
plane things that touch at all are one; only in separation is there
duality; by our holding away, the Supreme is set outside. This is
why the vision baffles telling; we cannot detach the Supreme to
state it; if we have seen something thus detached we have failed of
the Supreme which is to be known only as one with ourselves.
