<P>2. Our first observations must be directed to what passes in the
Sensible realm for Substance. It is, we shall agree, only by analogy
that the nature manifested in bodies is designated as Substance, and
by no means because such terms as Substance or Being tally with the
notion of bodies in flux; the proper term would be Becoming.

<P>But Becoming is not a uniform nature; bodies comprise under the
single head simples and composites, together with accidentals or
consequents, these last themselves capable of separate 
classification.

<P>Alternatively, Becoming may be divided into Matter and the Form
imposed upon Matter. These may be regarded each as a separate genus,
or else both may be brought under a single category and receive
alike the name of Substance.

<P>But what, we may ask, have Matter and Form in common? In what
sense can Matter be conceived as a genus, and what will be its
species? What is the differentia of Matter? In which genus, Matter or
Form, are we to rank the composite of both? It may be this very
composite which constitutes the Substance manifested in bodies,
neither of the components by itself answering to the conception of
Body: how, then, can we rank them in one and the same genus as the
composite? How can the elements of a thing be brought within the
same genus as the thing itself? Yet if we begin with bodies, our
first-principles will be compounds.

<P>Why not resort to analogy? Admitted that the 
classification of the
Sensible cannot proceed along the identical lines marked out for the
Intellectual: is there any reason why we should not for
Intellectual-Being substitute Matter, and for Intellectual Motion
substitute Sensible Form, which is in a sense the life and
consummation of Matter? The inertia of Matter would correspond with
Stability, while the Identity and Difference of the 
Intellectual would
find their counterparts in the similarity and diversity which obtain
in the Sensible realm.

<P>But, in the first place, Matter does not possess or acquire Form
as its life or its Act; Form enters it from without, and remains
foreign to its nature. Secondly, Form in the Intellectual is an Act
and a motion; in the Sensible Motion is different from Form and
accidental to it: Form in relation to Matter approximates rather to
Stability than to Motion; for by determining Matter's
indetermination it confers upon it a sort of repose.

<P>In the higher realm Identity and Difference presuppose a unity
at once identical and different: a thing in the lower is different
only by participation in Difference and in relation to some other
thing; Identity and Difference are here predicated of the
particular, which is not, as in that realm, a posterior.

<P>As for Stability, how can it belong to Matter, which is
distorted into every variety of mass, receiving its forms from
without, and even with the aid of these forms incapable of offspring.

<P>This mode of division must accordingly be abandoned.
