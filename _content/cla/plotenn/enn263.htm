<P>12. We are brought thus to the conception of a
Natural-Principle- Time- a certain expanse [a quantitative phase] of
the Life of the Soul, a principle moving forward by smooth 
and uniform
changes following silently upon each other- a Principle, then, whose
Act is sequent.

<P>But let us conceive this power of the Soul to turn back and
withdraw from the life-course which it now maintains, from the
continuous and unending activity of an ever-existent soul not
self-contained or self-intent but concerned about doing and
engendering: imagine it no longer accomplishing any Act, setting a
pause to this work it has inaugurated; let this outgoing phase of
the Soul become once more, equally with the rest, turned to the
Supreme, to Eternal Being, to the tranquilly stable.

<P>What would then exist but Eternity?

<P>All would remain in unity; how could there be any diversity of
things? What Earlier or Later would there be, what long-lasting or
short-lasting? What ground would lie ready to the Soul's 
operation but
the Supreme in which it has its Being? Or, indeed, what operative
tendency could it have even to That since a prior separation is the
necessary condition of tendency?

<P>The very sphere of the Universe would not exist; for it cannot
antedate Time: it, too, has its Being and its Movement in 
Time; and if
it ceased to move, the Soul-Act [which is the essence of Time]
continuing, we could measure the period of its Repose by 
that standard
outside it.

<P>If, then, the Soul withdrew, sinking itself again into its
primal unity, Time would disappear: the origin of Time, 
clearly, is to
be traced to the first stir of the Soul's tendency towards the
production of the sensible universe with the consecutive act
ensuing. This is how "Time"- as we read- "came into Being
simultaneously" with this All: the Soul begot at once the 
Universe and
Time; in that activity of the Soul this Universe sprang into being;
the activity is Time, the Universe is a content of Time. No doubt it
will be urged that we read also of the orbit of the Stars being
Times": but do not forget what follows; "the stars exist," we are
told, "for the display and delimitation of Time," and "that there
may be a manifest Measure." No indication of Time could be derived
from [observation of] the Soul; no portion of it can be seen or
handled, so it could not be measured in itself, especially when
there was as yet no knowledge of counting; therefore the Soul brings
into being night and day; in their difference is given Duality- from
which, we read, arises the concept of Number.

<P>We observe the tract between a sunrise and its return and, as
the movement is uniform, we thus obtain a Time-interval upon which
to measure ourselves, and we use this as a standard. We have thus a
measure of Time. Time itself is not a measure. How would it set to
work? And what kind of thing is there of which it could say, "I find
the extent of this equal to such and such a stretch of my 
own extent?"
What is this "I"? Obviously something by which measurement is known.
Time, then, serves towards measurement but is not itself the
Measure: the Movement of the All will be measured according to Time,
but Time will not, of its own Nature, be a Measure of Movement:
primarily a Kind to itself, it will incidentally exhibit the
magnitudes of that movement.

<P>And the reiterated observation of Movement- the same extent
found to be traversed in such and such a period- will lead to the
conception of a definite quantity of Time past.

<P>This brings us to the fact that, in a certain sense, the 
Movement,
the orbit of the universe, may legitimately be said to measure Time-
in so far as that is possible at all- since any definite stretch of
that circuit occupies a certain quantity of Time, and this 
is the only
grasp we have of Time, our only understanding of it: what 
that circuit
measures- by indication, that is- will be Time, manifested by the
Movement but not brought into being by it.

<P>This means that the measure of the Spheric Movement has itself
been measured by a definite stretch of that Movement and therefore
is something different; as measure, it is one thing and, as the
measured, it is another; [its being measure or] its being measured
cannot be of its essence.

<P>We are no nearer knowledge than if we said that the foot-rule
measures Magnitude while we left the concept Magnitude undefined;
or, again, we might as well define Movement- whose limitlessness
puts it out of our reach- as the thing measured by Space; the
definition would be parallel since we can mark off a certain space
which the Movement has traversed and say the one is equivalent to
the other.
