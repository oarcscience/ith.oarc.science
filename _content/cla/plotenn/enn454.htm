<P>2. Thus we may not look for the Intellectual objects [the Ideas]
outside of the Intellectual-Principle, treating them as 
impressions of
reality upon it: we cannot strip it of truth and so make its objects
unknowable and non-existent and in the end annul the
Intellectual-Principle itself. We must provide for knowledge and for
truth; we must secure reality; being must become knowable
essentially and not merely in that knowledge of quality which could
give us a mere image or vestige of the reality in lieu of
possession, intimate association, absorption.

<P>The only way to this is to leave nothing out side of the 
veritable
Intellectual-Principle which thus has knowledge in the true knowing
[that of identification with the object], cannot forget, need not go
wandering in search. At once truth is there, this is the seat of the
authentic Existents, it becomes living and intellective: 
these are the
essentials of that most lofty Principle; and, failing them, where is
its worth, its grandeur?

<P>Only thus [by this inherence of the Ideas] is it dispensed from
demonstration and from acts of faith in the truth of its 
knowledge: it
is its entire self, self-perspicuous: it knows a prior by
recognising its own source; it knows a sequent to that prior by its
self-identity; of the reality of this sequent, of the fact that it
is present and has authentic existence, no outer entity can bring it
surer conviction.

<P>Thus veritable truth is not accordance with an external; it is
self-accordance; it affirms and is nothing other than itself and is
nothing other; it is at once existence and self-affirmation. What
external, then, can call it to the question, and from what source of
truth could the refutation be brought? Any counter affirmation [of
truth] must fall into identity with the truth which first uttered
itself; brought forward as new, it has to appear before the
Principle which made the earlier statement and to show itself
identical with that: for there is no finding anything truer than the
true.
