<P>18. There remains still something to be said on the question
whether the soul uses deliberate reason before its descent and again
when it has left the body.

<P>Reasoning is for this sphere; it is the act of the soul fallen
into perplexity, distracted with cares, diminished in strength: the
need of deliberation goes with the less self-sufficing intelligence;
craftsmen faced by a difficulty stop to consider; where there is no
problem their art works on by its own forthright power.

<P>But if souls in the Supreme operate without reasoning, how can
they be called reasoning souls?

<P>One answer might be that they have the power of deliberating to
happy issue, should occasion arise: but all is met by repudiating
the particular kind of reasoning intended [the earthly and
discursive type]; we may represent to ourselves a reasoning 
that flows
uninterruptedly from the Intellectual-Principle in them, an inherent
state, an enduring activity, an assertion that is real; in this way
they would be users of reason even when in that overworld. We
certainly cannot think of them, it seems to me, as employing words
when, though they may occupy bodies in the heavenly region, they are
essentially in the Intellectual: and very surely the deliberation of
doubt and difficulty which they practise here must be unknown to
them There; all their act must fall into place by sheer 
force of their
nature; there can be no question of commanding or of taking counsel;
they will know, each, what is to be communicated from another, by
present consciousness. Even in our own case here, eyes often 
know what
is not spoken; and There all is pure, every being is, as it were, an
eye, nothing is concealed or sophisticated, there is no need of
speech, everything is seen and known. As for the Celestials [the
Daimones] and souls in the air, they may well use speech; for all
such are simply Animate [= Beings].
