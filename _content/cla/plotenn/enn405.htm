<P>6. Something besides a unity there must be or all would be
indiscernibly buried, shapeless within that unbroken whole: none of
the real beings [of the Intellectual Kosmos] would exist if 
that unity
remained at halt within itself: the plurality of these beings,
offspring of the unity, could not exist without their own nexts
taking the outward path; these are the beings holding the rank of
souls.

<P>In the same way the outgoing process could not end with 
the souls,
their issue stifled: every Kind must produce its next; it must
unfold from some concentrated central principle as from a 
seed, and so
advance to its term in the varied forms of sense. The prior in its
being will remain unalterably in the native seat; but there is the
lower phase, begotten to it by an ineffable faculty of its being,
native to soul as it exists in the Supreme.

<P>To this power we cannot impute any halt, any limit of jealous
grudging; it must move for ever outward until the universe stands
accomplished to the ultimate possibility. All, thus, is 
produced by an
inexhaustible power giving its gift to the universe, no part of
which it can endure to see without some share in its being.

<P>There is, besides, no principle that can prevent anything from
partaking, to the extent of its own individual receptivity in the
Nature of Good. If therefore Matter has always existed, that 
existence
is enough to ensure its participation in the being which, 
according to
each receptivity, communicates the supreme good universally: 
if on the
contrary, Matter has come into being as a necessary sequence of the
causes preceding it, that origin would similarly prevent it standing
apart from the scheme as though it were out of reach of the
principle to whose grace it owes its existence.

<P>In sum: The loveliness that is in the sense-realm is an index of
the nobleness of the Intellectual sphere, displaying its 
power and its
goodness alike: and all things are for ever linked; the one order
Intellectual in its being, the other of sense; one self-existent,
the other eternally taking its being by participation in that first,
and to the full of its power reproducing the Intellectual nature.
