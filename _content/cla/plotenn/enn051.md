#### Section 2

2\. It may be objected that our will towards living and towards
expressive activity is constant, and that each attainment of such
expression is an increase in Happiness.

But in the first place, by this reckoning every to-morrow's well-being
will be greater than to-day's, every later instalment successively
larger that an earlier; at once time supplants moral excellence as the
measure of felicity.

Then again the Gods to-day must be happier than of old: and their bliss,
too, is not perfect, will never be perfect. Further, when the will
attains what it was seeking, it attains something present: the quest is
always for something to be actually present until a standing felicity is
definitely achieved. The will to life which is will to Existence aims at
something present, since Existence must be a stably present thing. Even
when the act of the will is directed towards the future, and the
furthest future, its object is an actually present having and being:
there is no concern about what is passed or to come: the future state a
man seeks is to be a now to him; he does not care about the forever: he
asks that an actual present be actually present.
