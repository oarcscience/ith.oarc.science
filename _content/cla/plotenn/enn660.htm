<P>22. That light known, then indeed we are stirred towards those
Beings in longing and rejoicing over the radiance about them, just
as earthly love is not for the material form but for the Beauty
manifested upon it. Every one of those Beings exists for itself but
becomes an object of desire by the colour cast upon it from The
Good, source of those graces and of the love they evoke. The soul
taking that outflow from the divine is stirred; seized with a
Bacchic passion, goaded by these goads, it becomes Love. Before
that, even Intellectual-Principle with all its loveliness 
did not stir
the soul; for that beauty is dead until it take the light of 
The Good,
and the soul lies supine, cold to all, unquickened even to
Intellectual-Principle there before it. But when there enters into
it a glow from the divine, it gathers strength, awakens, spreads
true wings, and however urged by its nearer environing, speeds its
buoyant way elsewhere, to something greater to its memory: so long
as there exists anything loftier than the near, its very nature
bears it upwards, lifted by the giver of that love. Beyond
Intellectual-Principle it passes but beyond The Good it cannot, for
nothing stands above That. Let it remain in 
Intellectual-Principle and
it sees the lovely and august, but it is not there possessed 
of all it
sought; the face it sees is beautiful no doubt but not of power to
hold its gaze because lacking in the radiant grace which is the
bloom upon beauty.

<P>Even here we have to recognise that beauty is that which
irradiates symmetry rather than symmetry itself and is that which
truly calls out our love.

<P>Why else is there more of the glory of beauty upon the living
and only some faint trace of it upon the dead, though the face yet
retains all its fulness and symmetry? Why are the most living
portraits the most beautiful, even though the others happen 
to be more
symmetric? Why is the living ugly more attractive than the
sculptured handsome? It is that the one is more nearly what we are
looking for, and this because there is soul there, because there is
more of the Idea of The Good, because there is some glow of the
light of The Good and this illumination awakens and lifts 
the soul and
all that goes with it so that the whole man is won over to goodness,
and in the fullest measure stirred to life.
