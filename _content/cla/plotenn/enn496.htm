<P>5. This Intellectual-Principle, if the term is to convey the
truth, must be understood to be not a principle merely potential and
not one maturing from unintelligence to intelligence- that would
simply send us seeking, once more, a necessary prior- but a
principle which is intelligence in actuality and in eternity.

<P>Now a principle whose wisdom is not borrowed must derive from
itself any intellection it may make; and anything it may possess
within itself it can hold only from itself: it follows that,
intellective by its own resource and upon its own content, it is
itself the very things on which its intellection acts.

<P>For supposing its essence to be separable from its intellection
and the objects of its intellection to be not itself, then 
its essence
would be unintellectual; and it would be intellectual not 
actually but
potentially. The intellection and its object must then be 
inseparable-
however the habit induced by our conditions may tempt us to
distinguish, There too, the thinker from the thought.

<P>What then is its characteristic Act and what the intellection
which makes knower and known here identical?

<P>Clearly, as authentic Intellection, it has authentic
intellection of the authentically existent, and establishes their
existence. Therefore it is the Authentic Beings.

<P>Consider: It must perceive them either somewhere else or within
itself as its very self: the somewhere else is impossible- 
where could
that be?- they are therefore itself and the content of itself.

<P>Its objects certainly cannot be the things of sense, as people
think; no First could be of the sense-known order; for in things of
sense the Idea is but an image of the authentic, and every Idea thus
derivative and exiled traces back to that original and is no 
more than
an image of it.

<P>Further, if the Intellectual-Principle is to be the maker of
this All, it cannot make by looking outside itself to what does not
yet exist. The Authentic Beings must, then, exist before this All,
no copies made on a model but themselves archetypes, primals, and
the essence of the Intellectual-Principle.

<P>We may be told that Reason-Principles suffice [to the
subsistence of the All]: but then these, clearly, must be 
eternal; and
if eternal, if immune, then they must exist in an
Intellectual-Principle such as we have indicated, a principle
earlier than condition, than nature, than soul, than anything whose
existence is potential for contingent].

<P>The Intellectual-Principle, therefore, is itself the authentic
existences, not a knower knowing them in some sphere foreign to it.
The Authentic Beings, thus, exist neither before nor after it: it is
the primal legislator to Being or, rather, is itself the law 
of Being.
Thus it is true that "Intellectual and Being are identical"; in the
immaterial the knowledge of the thing is the thing. And this is the
meaning of the dictum "I sought myself," namely as one of the
Beings: it also bears on reminiscence.

<P>For none of the Beings is outside the 
Intellectual-Principle or in
space; they remain for ever in themselves, accepting no change, no
decay, and by that are the authentically existent. Things that arise
and fall away draw on real being as something to borrow 
from; they are
not of the real; the true being is that on which they draw.

<P>It is by participation that the sense-known has the being we
ascribe to it; the underlying nature has taken its shape from
elsewhere; thus bronze and wood are shaped into what we see by means
of an image introduced by sculpture or carpentry; the craft
permeates the materials while remaining integrally apart from the
material and containing in itself the reality of statue or couch.
And it is so, of course, with all corporeal things.

<P>This universe, characteristically participant in images, 
shows how
the image differs from the authentic beings: against the variability
of the one order, there stands the unchanging quality of the other,
self-situate, not needing space because having no magnitude, holding
an existent intellective and self-sufficing. The body-kind seeks its
endurance in another kind; the Intellectual-Principle, sustaining by
its marvellous Being, the things which of themselves must fall, does
not itself need to look for a staying ground.
