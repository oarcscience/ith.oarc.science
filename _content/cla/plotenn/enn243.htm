<P>12. This is Plato's conception: to him participation does not,
in the case of Matter, comport any such presence of an 
Ideal-form in a
Substance to be shaped by it as would produce one compound thing
made up of the two elements changing at the same moment, merging
into one another, modified each by the other.

<P>In his haste to his purpose he raises many difficult questions,
but he is determined to disown that view; he labours to indicate in
what mode Matter can receive the Ideal-forms without being, itself,
modified. The direct way is debarred since it is not easy to point
to things actually present in a base and yet leaving that base
unaffected: he therefore devises a metaphor for participation
without modification, one which supports, also, his thesis that all
appearing to the senses is void of substantial existence and that
the region of mere seeming is vast.

<P>Holding, as he does, that it is the patterns displayed 
upon Matter
that cause all experience in living bodies while the Matter itself
remains unaffected, he chooses this way of stating its immutability,
leaving us to make out for ourselves that those very patterns
impressed upon it do not comport any experience, any modification,
in itself.

<P>In the case, no doubt, of the living bodies that take one
pattern or shape after having borne another, it might be said that
there was a change, the variation of shape being made verbally
equivalent to a real change: but since Matter is essentially without
shape or magnitude, the appearing of shape upon it can by no freedom
of phrase be described as a change within it. On this point one must
have "a rule for thick and thin" one may safely say that the
underlying Kind contains nothing whatever in the mode commonly
supposed.

<P>But if we reject even the idea of its really containing at least
the patterns upon it, how is it, in any sense, a recipient?

<P>The answer is that in the metaphor cited we have some reasonably
adequate indication of the impassibility of Matter coupled with the
presence upon it of what may be described as images of things not
present.

<P>But we cannot leave the point of its impassibility without a
warning against allowing ourselves to be deluded by sheer custom of
speech.

<P>Plato speaks of Matter as becoming dry, wet, inflamed, 
but we must
remember the words that follow: "and taking the shape of air and of
water": this blunts the expressions "becoming wet, becoming 
inflamed";
once we have Matter thus admitting these shapes, we learn that it
has not itself become a shaped thing but that the shapes remain
distinct as they entered. We see, further, that the expression
"becoming inflamed" is not to be taken strictly: it is rather a case
of becoming fire. Becoming fire is very different from becoming
inflamed, which implies an outside agency and, therefore,
susceptibility to modification. Matter, being itself a portion of
fire, cannot be said to catch fire. To suggest that the fire not
merely permeates the matter, but actually sets it on fire is like
saying that a statue permeates its bronze.

<P>Further, if what enters must be an Ideal-Principle how could it
set Matter aflame? But what if it is a pattern or condition? No: the
object set aflame is so in virtue of the combination of Matter and
condition.

<P>But how can this follow on the conjunction when no unity has
been produced by the two?

<P>Even if such a unity had been produced, it would be a unity of
things not mutually sharing experiences but acting upon each other.
And the question would then arise whether each was effective upon
the other or whether the sole action was not that of one (the form)
preventing the other [the Matter] from slipping away?

<P>But when any material thing is severed, must not the Matter be
divided with it? Surely the bodily modification and other experience
that have accompanied the sundering, must have occurred,
identically, within the Matter?

<P>This reasoning would force the destructibility of Matter upon
us: "the body is dissolved; then the Matter is dissolved." We would
have to allow Matter to be a thing of quantity, a magnitude. 
But since
it is not a magnitude it could not have the experiences that 
belong to
magnitude and, on the larger scale, since it is not body it cannot
know the experiences of body.

<P>In fact those that declare Matter subject to modification may as
well declare it body right out.
