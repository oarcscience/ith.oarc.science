<P>1. What is our answer?

<P>All events and things, good and evil alike, are included 
under the
Universal Reason-Principle of which they are parts- strictly
"included" for this Universal Idea does not engender them but
encompasses them.

<P>The Reason-Principles are acts or expressions of a 
Universal Soul;
its parts [i.e., events good and evil] are expressions of these
Soulparts.

<P>This unity, Soul, has different parts; the Reason-Principles,
correspondingly, will also have their parts, and so, too, will the
ultimates of the system, all that they bring into being.

<P>The Souls are in harmony with each other and so, too, are their
acts and effects; but it is harmony in the sense of a resultant
unity built out of contraries. All things, as they rise from a
unity, come back to unity by a sheer need of nature; differences
unfold themselves, contraries are produced, but all is drawn into
one organized system by the unity at the source.

<P>The principle may be illustrated from the different classes of
animal life: there is one genus, horse, though horses among 
themselves
fight and bite and show malice and angry envy: so all the others
within the unity of their Kind; and so humanity.

<P>All these types, again, can be ranged under the one Kind, that
of living things; objects without life can be thought of under their
specific types and then be resumed under the one Kind of the
"non-living"; if we choose to go further yet, living and non-living
may be included under the one Kind, "Beings," and, further still,
under the Source of Being.

<P>Having attached all to this source, we turn to move down again
in continuous division: we see the Unity fissuring, as it reaches
out into Universality, and yet embracing all in one system so that
with all its differentiation it is one multiple living thing- an
organism in which each member executes the function of its own
nature while it still has its being in that One Whole; fire burns;
horse does horse work; men give, each the appropriate act of the
peculiar personal quality- and upon the several particular Kinds to
which each belongs follow the acts, and the good or evil of the life.
