<P>18. There remains the question whether the body possesses any
force of its own- so that, with the incoming of the soul, it lives
in some individuality- or whether all it has is this Nature we have
been speaking of, the superior principle which enters into relations
with it.

<P>Certainly the body, container of soul and of nature, cannot even
in itself be as a soulless form would be: it cannot even be like air
traversed by light; it must be like air storing heat: the 
body holding
animal or vegetive life must hold also some shadow of soul; and it
is body thus modified that is the seat of corporeal pains and
pleasures which appear before us, the true human being, in such a
way as to produce knowledge without emotion. By "us, the true human
being" I mean the higher soul for, in spite of all, the modified
body is not alien but attached to our nature and is a concern to us
for that reason: "attached," for this is not ourselves nor yet are
we free of it; it is an accessory and dependent of the human being;
"we" means the master-principle; the conjoint, similarly is 
in its own
way an "ours"; and it is because of this that we care for 
its pain and
pleasure, in proportion as we are weak rather than strong, gripped
rather than working towards detachment.

<P>The other, the most honourable phase of our being, is what we
think of as the true man and into this we are penetrating.

<P>Pleasure and pain and the like must not be attributed to the
soul alone, but to the modified body and to something intermediary
between soul and body and made up of both. A unity is independent:
thus body alone, a lifeless thing, can suffer no hurt- in its
dissolution there is no damage to the body, but merely to its unity-
and soul in similar isolation cannot even suffer dissolution, and by
its very nature is immune from evil.

<P>But when two distinct things become one in an artificial unity,
there is a probable source of pain to them in the mere fact that
they were inapt to partnership. This does not, of course, 
refer to two
bodies; that is a question of one nature; and I am speaking of two
natures. When one distinct nature seeks to associate itself with
another, a different, order of being- the lower participating in the
higher, but unable to take more than a faint trace of it- then the
essential duality becomes also a unity, but a unity standing midway
between what the lower was and what it cannot absorb, and therefore
a troubled unity; the association is artificial and uncertain,
inclining now to this side and now to that in ceaseless vacillation;
and the total hovers between high and low, telling, downward bent,
of misery but, directed to the above, of longing for unison.
