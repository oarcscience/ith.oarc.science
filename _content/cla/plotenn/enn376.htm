<P>2. But if perception does not go by impression, what is the
process?

<P>The mind affirms something not contained within it: this is
precisely the characteristic of a power- not to accept 
impression but,
within its allotted sphere, to act.

<P>Besides, the very condition of the mind being able to exercise
discrimination upon what it is to see and hear is not, of 
course, that
these objects be equally impressions made upon it; on the contrary,
there must be no impressions, nothing to which the mind is passive;
there can be only acts of that in which the objects become known.

<P>Our tendency is to think of any of the faculties as 
unable to know
its appropriate object by its own uncompelled act; to us it seems to
submit to its environment rather than simply to perceive it, 
though in
reality it is the master, not the victim.

<P>As with sight, so with hearing. It is the air which takes the
impression, a kind of articulated stroke which may be compared to
letters traced upon it by the object causing the sound; but 
it belongs
to the faculty, and the soul-essence, to read the imprints thus
appearing before it, as they reach the point at which they become
matter of its knowledge.

<P>In taste and smell also we distinguish between the impressions
received and the sensations and judgements; these last are mental
acts, and belong to an order apart from the experiences upon which
they are exercised.

<P>The knowing of the things belonging to the Intellectual is not
in any such degree attended by impact or impression: they come
forward, on the contrary, as from within, unlike the sense-objects
known as from without: they have more emphatically the character of
acts; they are acts in the stricter sense, for their origin is in
the soul, and every concept of this Intellectual order is the soul
about its Act.

<P>Whether, in this self-vision, the soul is a duality and views
itself as from the outside- while seeing the 
Intellectual-Principal as
a unity, and itself with the Intellectual-Principle as a unity- this
question is investigated elsewhere.
