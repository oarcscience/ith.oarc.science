<P>8. For my part I am satisfied that anyone considering the mode
in which Matter participates in the Ideas will be ready enough to
accept this tenet of omnipresence in identity, no longer rejecting
it as incredible or even difficult. This because it seems reasonable
and imperative to dismiss any notion of the Ideas lying apart with
Matter illumined from them as from somewhere above- a meaningless
conception, for what have distance and separation to do here?

<P>This participation cannot be thought of as elusive or very
perplexing; on the contrary, it is obvious, accessible in many
examples.

<P>Note, however, that when we sometimes speak of the Ideas
illuminating Matter this is not to suggest the mode in which
material light pours down on a material object; we use the phrase in
the sense only that, the material being image while the Ideas are
archetypes, the two orders are distinguished somewhat in the 
manner of
illuminant and illuminated. But it is time to be more exact.

<P>We do not mean that the Idea, locally separate, shows itself in
Matter like a reflection in water; the Matter touches the Idea at
every point, though not in a physical contact, and, by dint of
neighbourhood- nothing to keep them apart- is able to absorb thence
all that lies within its capacity, the Idea itself not penetrating,
not approaching, the Matter, but remaining self-locked.

<P>We take it, then, that the Idea, say of Fire- for we had 
best deal
with Matter as underlying the elements- is not in the Matter. The
Ideal Fire, then, remaining apart, produces the form of fire
throughout the entire enfired mass. Now let us suppose- and the same
method will apply to all the so-called elements- that this 
Fire in its
first material manifestation is a multiple mass. That single Fire is
seen producing an image of itself in all the sensible fires; 
yet it is
not spatially separate; it does not, then, produce that image in the
manner of our visible light; for in that case all this sensible
fire, supposing that it were a whole of parts [as the analogy would
necessitate], must have generated spatial positions out of itself,
since the Idea or Form remains in a non-spatial world; for a 
principle
thus pluralized must first have departed from its own character in
order to be present in that many and participate many times 
in the one
same Form.

<P>The Idea, impartible, gives nothing of itself to the Matter; its
unbreaking unity, however, does not prevent it shaping that multiple
by its own unity and being present to the entirety of the multiple,
bringing it to pattern not by acting part upon part but by presence
entire to the object entire. It would be absurd to introduce a
multitude of Ideas of Fire, each several fire being shaped by a
particular idea; the Ideas of fire would be infinite. Besides, how
would these resultant fires be distinct, when fire is a continuous
unity? and if we apply yet another fire to certain matter and
produce a greater fire, then the same Idea must be allowed to have
functioned in the same way in the new matter as in the old;
obviously there is no other Idea.
