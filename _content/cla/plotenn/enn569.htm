<P>9. So much for one of the genera- the "Substance," so called, of
the Sensible realm.

<P>But what are we to posit as its species? how divide this genus?

<P>The genus as a whole must be identified with body. Bodies may be
divided into the characteristically material and the organic: the
material bodies comprise fire, earth, water, air; the organic the
bodies of plants and animals, these in turn admitting of formal
differentiation.

<P>The next step is to find the species of earth and of the other
elements, and in the case of organic bodies to distinguish plants
according to their forms, and the bodies of animals either by their
habitations- on the earth, in the earth, and similarly for the other
elements- or else as light, heavy and intermediate. Some bodies, we
shall observe, stand in the middle of the universe, others
circumscribe it from above, others occupy the middle sphere: in each
case we shall find bodies different in shape, so that the bodies of
the living beings of the heavens may be differentiated from those of
the other elements.

<P>Once we have classified bodies into the four species, we 
are ready
to combine them on a different principle, at the same time
intermingling their differences of place, form and constitution; the
resultant combinations will be known as fiery or earthy on the basis
of the excess or predominance of some one element.

<P>The distinction between First and Second Substances, between
Fire and a given example of fire, entails a difference of a peculiar
kind- the difference between universal and particular. This 
however is
not a difference characteristic of Substance; there is also 
in Quality
the distinction between whiteness and the white object, between
grammar and some particular grammar.

<P>The question may here be asked: "What deficiency has grammar
compared with a particular grammar, and science as a whole in
comparison with a science?" Grammar is certainly not posterior to
the particular grammar: on the contrary, the grammar as in 
you depends
upon the prior existence of grammar as such: the grammar as in you
becomes a particular by the fact of being in you; it is otherwise
identical with grammar the universal.

<P>Turn to the case of Socrates: it is not Socrates who bestows
manhood upon what previously was not Man, but Man upon Socrates; the
individual man exists by participation in the universal.

<P>Besides, Socrates is merely a particular instance of Man; this
particularity can have no effect whatever in adding to his essential
manhood.

<P>We may be told that Man [the universal] is Form alone, Socrates
Form in Matter. But on this very ground Socrates will be less fully
Man than the universal; for the Reason-Principle will be less
effectual in Matter. If, on the contrary, Man is not determined by
Form alone, but presupposes Matter, what deficiency has Man in
comparison with the material manifestation of Man, or the
Reason-Principle in isolation as compared with its embodiment in a
unit of Matter?

<P>Besides, the more general is by nature prior; hence, the 
Form-Idea
is prior to the individual: but what is prior by nature is prior
unconditionally. How then can the Form take a lower rank? The
individual, it is true, is prior in the sense of being more readily
accessible to our cognisance; this fact, however, entails no 
objective
difference.

<P>Moreover, such a difference, if established, would be 
incompatible
with a single Reason-Principle of Substance; First and Second
Substance could not have the same Principle, nor be brought under a
single genus.
