<P>16. The question arises what phase of the Soul enters into the
union for the period of embodiment and what phase remains distinct,
what is separable and what necessarily interlinked, and in general
what the Living-Being is.

<P>On all this there has been a conflict of teaching: the 
matter must
be examined later on from quite other considerations than occupy us
here. For the present let us explain in what sense we have described
the All as the expressed idea of the Governing Soul.

<P>One theory might be that the Soul creates the particular
entities in succession- man followed by horse and other animals
domestic or wild: fire and earth, though, first of all- that it
watches these creations acting upon each other whether to help or to
harm, observes, and no more, the tangled web formed of all these
strands, and their unfailing sequences; and that it makes no concern
of the result beyond securing the reproduction of the primal
living-beings, leaving them for the rest to act upon each other
according to their definite natures.

<P>Another view makes the soul answerable for all that thus comes
about, since its first creations have set up the entire enchainment.

<P>No doubt the Reason-Principle [conveyed by the Soul] covers all
the action and experience of this realm: nothing happens, even here,
by any form of haphazard; all follows a necessary order.

<P>Is everything, then, to be attributed to the act of the
Reason-Principles?

<P>To their existence, no doubt, but not to their effective action;
they exist and they know; or better, the Soul, which contains the
engendering Reason-Principle, knows the results of all it has
brought to pass. For whensoever similar factors meet and act in
relation to each other, similar consequences must inevitably ensue:
the Soul adopting or foreplanning the given conditions accomplishes
the due outcome and links all into a total.

<P>All, then, is antecedent and resultant, each sequent becoming in
turn an antecedent once it has taken its place among things. And
perhaps this is a cause of progressive deterioration: men, for
instance, are not as they were of old; by dint of interval and of
the inevitable law, the Reason-Principles have ceded something to
the characteristics of the Matter.

<P>But:

<P>The Soul watches the ceaselessly changing universe and 
follows all
the fate of all its works: this is its life, and it knows no respite
from this care, but is ever labouring to bring about perfection,
planning to lead all to an unending state of excellence- like a
farmer, first sowing and planting and then constantly setting to
rights where rainstorms and long frosts and high gales have played
havoc.

<P>If such a conception of Soul be rejected as untenable, we are
obliged to think that the Reason-Principles themselves foreknew or
even contained the ruin and all the consequences of flaw.

<P>But then we would be imputing the creation of evil to the
Reason-Principles, though the arts and their guiding principle do
not include blundering, do not cover the inartistic, the destruction
of the work of art.

<P>And here it will be objected that in All there is 
nothing contrary
to nature, nothing evil.

<P>Still, by the side of the better there exists also what is less
good.

<P>Well, perhaps even the less good has its contributory 
value in the
All. Perhaps there is no need that everything be good. Contraries
may co-operate; and without opposites there could be no ordered
Universe: all living beings of the partial realm include contraries.
The better elements are compelled into existence and moulded to
their function by the Reason-Principle directly; the less good are
potentially present in the Reason-Principles, actually present in
the phenomena themselves; the Soul's power had reached its limit,
and failed to bring the Reason-Principles into complete actuality
since, amid the clash of these antecedent Principles, Matter had
already from its own stock produced the less good.

<P>Yet, with all this, Matter is continuously overruled towards the
better; so that out of the total of things- modified by Soul on the
one hand and by Matter on the other hand, and on neither 
hand as sound
as in the Reason-Principles- there is, in the end, a Unity.
