<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 8</H4>

<P>8. The division into elements must, in short, be abandoned,
especially in regard to Sensible Substance, known 
necessarily by sense
rather than by reason. We must no longer look for help in
constituent parts, since such parts will not be substances, or at
any rate not sensible substances.

<P>Our plan must be to apprehend what is constant in stone, earth,
water and the entities which they compose- the vegetal and animal
forms, considered purely as sensibles- and to confine this constant
within a single genus. Neither Matter nor Form will thus be
overlooked, for Sensible Substance comports them; fire and earth and
the two intermediaries consist of Matter and Form, while composite
things are actually many substances in one. They all, moreover, have
that common property which distinguishes them from other things:
serving as subjects to these others, they are never 
themselves present
in a subject nor predicated of any other thing. Similarly, all the
characteristics which we have ascribed to Substance find a place in
this classification.

<P>But Sensible Substance is never found apart from magnitude and
quality: how then do we proceed to separate these accidents? If we
subtract them- magnitude, figure, colour, dryness, moistness- what
is there left to be regarded as Substance itself? All the substances
under consideration are, of course, qualified.

<P>There is, however, something in relation to which whatever turns
Substance into qualified Substance is accidental: thus, the whole of
fire is not Substance, but only a part of it- if the term "part" be
allowed.

<P>What then can this "part" be? Matter may be suggested. But are
we actually to maintain that the particular sensible substance
consists of a conglomeration of qualities and Matter, while Sensible
Substance as a whole is merely the sum of these coagulations in the
uniform Matter, each one separately forming a quale or a quantum or
else a thing of many qualities? Is it true to say that everything
whose absence leaves subsistence incomplete is a part of the
particular substance, while all that is accidental to the substance
already existent takes independent rank and is not submerged in the
mixture which constitutes this so-called substance?

<P>I decline to allow that whatever combines in this way with
anything else is Substance if it helps to produce a single 
mass having
quantity and quality, whereas taken by itself and divorced from this
complementary function it is a quality: not everything which
composes the amalgam is Substance, but only the amalgam as a whole.

<P>And let no one take exception on the ground that we produce
Sensible Substance from non-substances. The whole amalgam itself is
not True Substance; it is merely an imitation of that True Substance
which has Being apart from its concomitants, these indeed being
derived from it as the possessor of True Being. In the lower 
realm the
case is different: the underlying ground is sterile, and from its
inability to produce fails to attain to the status of Being; it
remains a shadow, and on this shadow is traced a sketch- the world
of Appearance.
