<P>12. We may be told that unity and monad have no real existence,
that the only unity is some definite object that is one 
thing, so that
all comes to an attitude of the mind towards things 
considered singly.

<P>But, to begin with, why at this should not the affirmation of
Being pass equally as an attitude of mind so that Being too must
disappear? No doubt Being strikes and stings and gives the
impression of reality; but we find ourselves just as vividly struck
and impressed in the presence of unity. Besides, is this attitude,
this concept itself, a unity or a manifold? When we deny the unity
of an object, clearly the unity mentioned is not supplied by the
object, since we are saying it has none; the unity therefore 
is within
ourselves, something latent in our minds independently of 
any concrete
one thing.

<P>[An objector speaks-] "But the unity we thus possess comes by
our acceptance of a certain idea or impression from things external;
it is a notion derived from an object. Those that take the notion of
numbers and of unity to be but one species of the notions held to be
inherent in the mind must allow to numbers and to unity the reality
they ascribe to any of the others, and upon occasion they 
must be met;
but no such real existence can be posited when the concept 
is taken to
be an attitude or notion rising in us as a by-product of the
objects; this happens when we say "This," "What," and still more
obviously in the affirmations "Crowd," "Festival," "Army,"
"Multiplicity." As multiplicity is nothing apart from certain
constituent items and the festival nothing apart from the people
gathered happily at the rites, so when we affirm unity we are not
thinking of some Oneness self-standing, unrelated. And there are
many other such cases; for instance "on the right," "Above" and
their opposites; what is there of reality about this
"On-the-right-ness" but the fact that two different positions are
occupied? So with "Above": "Above" and "Below" are a mere matter of
position and have no significance outside of this sphere.

<P>Now in answer to this series of objections our first remark is
that there does exist an actuality implicit in each one of the
relations cited; though this is not the same for all or the same for
correlatives or the same for every reference to unity.

<P>But these objections must be taken singly.
