<P>6. Well, but take the unhappy man: must not increase of 
time bring
an increase of his unhappiness? Do not all troubles- long-lasting
pains, sorrows, and everything of that type- yield a greater sum of
misery in the longer time? And if thus in misery the evil is 
augmented
by time why should not time equally augment happiness when all is
well?

<P>In the matter of sorrows and pains there is, no doubt, ground
for saying that time brings increase: for example, in a lingering
malady the evil hardens into a state, and as time goes on the body
is brought lower and lower. But if the constitution did not
deteriorate, if the mischief grew no worse, then, here too, there
would be no trouble but that of the present moment: we 
cannot tell the
past into the tale of unhappiness except in the sense that 
it has gone
to make up an actually existing state- in the sense that, the evil
in the sufferer's condition having been extended over a longer time,
the mischief has gained ground. The increase of ill-being then is
due to the aggravation of the malady not to the extension of time.

<P>It may be pointed out also that this greater length of 
time is not
a thing existent at any given moment; and surely a "more" is 
not to be
made out by adding to something actually present something that has
passed away.

<P>No: true happiness is not vague and fluid: it is an unchanging
state.

<P>If there is in this matter any increase besides that of 
mere time,
it is in the sense that a greater happiness is the reward of a
higher virtue: this is not counting up to the credit of happiness
the years of its continuance; it is simply noting the high-water
mark once for all attained.
