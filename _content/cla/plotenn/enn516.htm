<P>10. As regards Quality, the source of what we call a "quale," we
must in the first place consider what nature it possesses in
accordance with which it produces the "qualia," and whether, 
remaining
one and the same in virtue of that common ground, it has also
differences whereby it produces the variety of species. If 
there is no
common ground and the term Quality involves many connotations, there
cannot be a single genus of Quality.

<P>What then will be the common ground in habit, 
disposition, passive
quality, figure, shape? In light, thick and lean?

<P>If we hold this common ground to be a power adapting 
itself to the
forms of habits, dispositions and physical capacities, a power which
gives the possessor whatever capacities he has, we have no plausible
explanation of incapacities. Besides, how are figure and the shape
of a given thing to be regarded as a power?

<P>Moreover, at this, Being will have no power qua Being but only
when Quality has been added to it; and the activities of those
substances which are activities in the highest degree, will be
traceable to Quality, although they are autonomous and owe their
essential character to powers wholly their own!

<P>Perhaps, however, qualities are conditioned by powers which are
posterior to the substances as such [and so do not interfere with
their essential activities]. Boxing, for example, is not a power of
man qua man; reasoning is: therefore reasoning, on this 
hypothesis, is
not quality but a natural possession of the mature human being; it
therefore is called a quality only by analogy. Thus, Quality is a
power which adds the property of being qualia to substances already
existent.

<P>The differences distinguishing substances from each other are
called qualities only by analogy; they are, more strictly, Acts and
Reason-Principles, or parts of Reason-Principles, and though they
may appear merely to qualify the substance, they in fact indicate
its essence.

<P>Qualities in the true sense- those, that is, which determine
qualia- being in accordance with our definition powers, will 
in virtue
of this common ground be a kind of Reason-Principle; they 
will also be
in a sense Forms, that is, excellences and imperfections whether of
soul or of body.

<P>But how can they all be powers? Beauty or health of soul or
body, very well: but surely not ugliness, disease, weakness,
incapacity. In a word, is powerlessness a power?

<P>It may be urged that these are qualities in so far as qualia are
also named after them: but may not the qualia be so called 
by analogy,
and not in the strict sense of the single principle? Not only may
the term be understood in the four ways [of Aristotle], but each of
the four may have at least a twofold significance.

<P>In the first place, Quality is not merely a question of 
action and
passion, involving a simple distinction between the 
potentially active
[quality] and the passive: health, disposition and habit, disease,
strength and weakness are also classed as qualities. It follows that
the common ground is not power, but something we have still to seek.

<P>Again, not all qualities can be regarded as Reason-Principles:
chronic disease cannot be a Reason-Principle. Perhaps, however, we
must speak in such cases of privations, restricting the term
"Quantities" to Ideal-Forms and powers. Thus we shall have, not a
single genus, but reference only to the unity of a category. 
Knowledge
will be regarded as a Form and a power, ignorance as a privation and
powerlessness.

<P>On the other hand, powerlessness and disease are a kind of Form;
disease and vice have many powers though looking to evil.

<P>But how can a mere failure be a power? Doubtless the 
truth is that
every quality performs its own function independently of a standard;
for in no case could it produce an effect outside of its power.

<P>Even beauty would seem to have a power of its own. Does 
this apply
to triangularity?

<P>Perhaps, after all, it is not a power we must consider, but a
disposition. Thus, qualities will be determined by the forms and
characteristics of the object qualified: their common element, then,
will be Form and ideal type, imposed upon Substance and posterior to
it.

<P>But then, how do we account for the powers? We may doubtless
remark that even the natural boxer is so by being constituted in a
particular way; similarly, with the man unable to box: to
generalize, the quality is a characteristic non-essential. 
Whatever is
seen to apply alike to Being and to non-Being, as do heat and
whiteness and colours generally, is either different from Being- is,
for example, an Act of Being- or else is some secondary of Being,
derived from it, contained in it, its image and likeness.

<P>But if Quality is determined by formation and characteristic and
Reason-Principle, how explain the various cases of powerlessness and
deformity? Doubtless we must think of Principles imperfectly
present, as in the case of deformity. And disease- how does 
that imply
a Reason-Principle? Here, no doubt, we must think of a principle
disturbed, the Principle of health.

<P>But it is not necessary that all qualities involve a
Reason-Principle; it suffices that over and above the 
various kinds of
disposition there exist a common element distinct from Substance,
and it is what comes after the substance that constitutes Quality in
an object.

<P>But triangularity is a quality of that in which it is present;
it is however no longer triangularity as such, but the triangularity
present in that definite object and modified in proportion to its
success in shaping that object.
