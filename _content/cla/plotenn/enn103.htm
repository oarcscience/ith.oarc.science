<P>1. That the circuit of the stars indicates definite 
events to come
but without being the cause direct of all that happens, has been
elsewhere affirmed, and proved by some modicum of argument: but the
subject demands more precise and detailed investigation for to take
the one view rather than the other is of no small moment.

<P>The belief is that the planets in their courses actually produce
not merely such conditions as poverty, wealth, health and 
sickness but
even ugliness and beauty and, gravest of all, vices and 
virtue and the
very acts that spring from these qualities, the definite doings of
each moment of virtue or vice. We are to suppose the stars to be
annoyed with men- and upon matters in which men, moulded to what
they are by the stars themselves, can surely do them no wrong.

<P>They will be distributing what pass for their good gifts, not
out of kindness towards the recipients but as they themselves are
affected pleasantly or disagreeably at the various points of their
course; so that they must be supposed to change their plans as they
stand at their zeniths or are declining.

<P>More absurdly still, some of them are supposed to be 
malicious and
others to be helpful, and yet the evil stars will bestow favours and
the benevolent act harshly: further, their action alters as they see
each other or not, so that, after all, they possess no 
definite nature
but vary according to their angles of aspect; a star is 
kindly when it
sees one of its fellows but changes at sight of another: and there
is even a distinction to be made in the seeing as it occurs in this
figure or in that. Lastly, all acting together, the fused 
influence is
different again from that of each single star, just as the 
blending of
distinct fluids gives a mixture unlike any of them.

<P>Since these opinions and others of the same order are prevalent,
it will be well to examine them carefully one by one, beginning with
the fundamental question:
