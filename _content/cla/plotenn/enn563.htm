<P>3. How then do we go to work?

<P>Let us begin by distinguishing Matter, Form, the Mixture of
both, and the Attributes of the Mixture. The Attributes may be
subdivided into those which are mere predicates, and those serving
also as accidents. The accidents may be either inclusive or
included; they may, further, be classified as activities, 
experiences,
consequents.

<P>Matter will be found common to all substances, not however as a
genus, since it has no differentiae- unless indeed differentiae be
ascribed to it on the ground of its taking such various forms as
fire and air.

<P>It may be held that Matter is sufficiently constituted a genus
by the fact that the things in which it appears hold it in common,
or in that it presents itself as a whole of parts. In this sense
Matter will indeed be a genus, though not in the accepted 
sense of the
term. Matter, we may remark, is also a single element, if the
element as such is able to constitute a genus.

<P>Further, if to a Form be added the qualification "bound up with,
involved in Matter," Matter separates that Form from other Forms: it
does not however embrace the whole of Substantial Form [as, to be
the genus of Form, it must].

<P>We may, again, regard Form as the creator of Substance and make
the Reason-Principle of Substance dependent upon Form: yet we do not
come thereby to an understanding of the nature of Substance.

<P>We may, also, restrict Substance to the Composite. 
Matter and Form
then cease to be substances. If they are Substance equally with the
Composite, it remains to enquire what there is common to all three.

<P>The "mere predicates" fall under the category of Relation: such
are cause and element. The accidents included in the composite
substances ire found to be either Quality or Quantity; those 
which are
inclusive are of the nature of Space and Time. Activities and
experiences comprise Motions; consequents Space and Time, which are
consequents respectively of the Composites and of Motion.

<P>The first three entities [Matter, Form, Composite] go, as we
have discovered, to make a single common genus, the Sensible
counterpart of Substance. Then follow in order Relation, Quantity,
Quality, Time-during-which, Place-in-which, Motion; though, with
Time and Space already included [under Relation], Time-during-which
and Place-in-which become superfluous.

<P>Thus we have five genera, counting the first three entities as
one. If the first three are not massed into a unity, the series will
be Matter, Form, Composite, Relation, Quantity, Quality, Motion. The
last three may, again, be included in Relation, which is capable of
bearing this wider extension.
