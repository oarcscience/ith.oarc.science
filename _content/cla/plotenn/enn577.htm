<P>17. This procedure, if approved, will entail a 
distinction between
psychic and bodily qualities, the latter belonging specifically to
body.

<P>If we decide to refer all souls to the higher, we are still at
liberty to perform for Sensible qualities a division founded upon
the senses themselves- the eyes, the ears, touch, taste, 
smell; and if
we are to look for further differences, colours may be subdivided
according to varieties of vision, sounds according to varieties of
hearing, and so with the other senses: sounds may also be classified
qualitatively as sweet, harsh, soft.

<P>Here a difficulty may be raised: we divide the varieties of
Substance and their functions and activities, fair or foul or indeed
of any kind whatsoever, on the basis of Quality, Quantity rarely, if
ever, entering into the differences which produce species; Quantity,
again, we divide in accordance with qualities of its own: 
how then are
we to divide Quality itself into species? what differences are we to
employ, and from what genus shall we take them? To take them from
Quality itself would be no less absurd than setting up substances as
differences of substances.

<P>How, then, are we to distinguish black from white? how
differentiate colours in general from tastes and tangible qualities?
By the variety of sense-organs? Then there will be no difference in
the objects themselves.

<P>But, waiving this objection, how deal with qualities perceived
by the same sense-organ? We may be told that some colours integrate,
others disintegrate the vision, that some tastes integrate, others
disintegrate the tongue: we reply that, first, it is the actual
experiences [of colour and taste, and not the sense-organs] that we
are discussing and it is to these that the notions of integration
and disintegration must be applied; secondly, a means of
differentiating these experiences has not been offered.

<P>It may be suggested that we divide them by their powers, and
this suggestion is so far reasonable that we may well agree to
divide the non-sensuous qualities, the sciences for example, on this
basis; but we see no reason for resorting to their effects for the
division of qualities sensuous. Even if we divide the sciences by
their powers, founding our division of their processes upon the
faculties of the mind, we can only grasp their differences in a
rational manner if we look not only to their subject-matter but also
to their Reason-Principles.

<P>But, granted that we may divide the arts by their
Reason-Principles and theorems, this method will hardly apply to
embodied qualities. Even in the arts themselves an explanation would
be required for the differences between the Reason-Principles
themselves. Besides, we have no difficulty in seeing that white
differs from black; to account for this difference is the purpose of
our enquiry.
