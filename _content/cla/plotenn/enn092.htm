<P>3. We have to ask, that is, how Matter, this entity of ceaseless
flux constituting the physical mass of the universe, could serve
towards the immortality of the Kosmos.

<P>And our answer is "Because the flux is not outgoing": where
there is motion within but not outwards and the total remains
unchanged, there is neither growth nor decline, and thus the Kosmos
never ages.

<P>We have a parallel in our earth, constant from eternity 
to pattern
and to mass; the air, too, never fails; and there is always 
water: all
the changes of these elements leave unchanged the Principle of the
total living thing, our world. In our own constitution, again, there
is a ceaseless shifting of particles- and that with outgoing 
loss- and
yet the individual persists for a long time: where there is no
question of an outside region, the body-principle cannot clash with
soul as against the identity and endless duration of the 
living thing.

<P>Of these material elements- for example- fire, the keen 
and swift,
cooperates by its upward tendency as earth by its lingering 
below; for
we must not imagine that the fire, once it finds itself at the point
where its ascent must stop, settles down as in its appropriate
place, no longer seeking, like all the rest, to expand in both
directions. No: but higher is not possible; lower is repugnant to
its Kind; all that remains for it is to be tractable and, 
answering to
a need of its nature, to be drawn by the Soul to the 
activity of life,
and so to move to in a glorious place, in the Soul. Anyone 
that dreads
its falling may take heart; the circuit of the Soul provides against
any declination, embracing, sustaining; and since fire has of itself
no downward tendency it accepts that guiding without resistance. The
partial elements constituting our persons do not suffice for 
their own
cohesion; once they are brought to human shape, they must borrow
elsewhere if the organism is to be maintained: but in the upper
spheres since there can be no loss by flux no such replenishment is
needed.

<P>Suppose such loss, suppose fire extinguished there, then a new
fire must be kindled; so also if such loss by flux could 
occur in some
of the superiors from which the celestial fire depends, that too
must be replaced: but with such transmutations, while there might be
something continuously similar, there would be, no longer, a Living
All abidingly self-identical.
