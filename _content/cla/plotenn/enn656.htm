<P>18. But in what way is the content of Intellectual-Principle
participant in good? Is it because each member of it is an Idea or
because of their beauty or how?

<P>Anything coming from The Good carries the image and type 
belonging
to that original or deriving from it, as anything going back 
to warmth
or sweetness carries the memory of those originals: Life entered
into Intellectual-Principle from The Supreme, for its origin 
is in the
Activity streaming Thence; Intellectual-Principle springs from the
Supreme, and with it the beauty of the Ideas; at once all 
these, Life,
Intellectual-Principle, Idea, must inevitably have goodness.

<P>But what is the common element in them? Derivation from the
First is not enough to procure identical quality; there must be some
element held in common by the things derived: one source may produce
many differing things as also one outgoing thing may take difference
in various recipients: what enters into the First Act is different
from what that Act transmits and there is difference, again, in the
effect here. Nonetheless every item may be good in a degree of its
own. To what, then, is the highest degree due?

<P>But first we must ask whether Life is a good, bare Life, or only
the Life streaming Thence, very different from the Life known here?
Once more, then, what constitutes the goodness of Life?

<P>The Life of The Good, or rather not its Life but that given
forth from it.

<P>But if in that higher Life there must be something from That,
something which is the Authentic Life, we must admit that since
nothing worthless can come Thence Life in itself is good; so too we
must admit, in the case of Authentic Intellectual-Principle, that
its Life because good derives from that First; thus it becomes clear
that every Idea is good and informed by the Good. The Ideas must
have something of good, whether as a common property or as a
distinct attribution or as held in some distinct measure.

<P>Thus it is established that the particular Idea contains in its
essence something of good and thereby becomes a good thing; for Life
we found to be good not in the bare being but in its derivation from
the Authentic, the Supreme whence it sprung: and the same is true of
Intellectual-Principle: we are forced therefore admit a certain
identity.

<P>When, with all their differences, things may be affirmed 
to have a
measure of identity, the matter of the identity may very well be
established in their very essence and yet be mentally 
abstracted; thus
life in man or horse yields the notion of animal; from water or fire
we may get that of warmth; the first case is a definition of 
Kind, the
other two cite qualities, primary and secondary respectively. Both
or one part of Intellect, then, would be called by the one term good.

<P>Is The Good, then, inherent in the Ideas essentially? 
Each of them
is good but the goodness is not that of the Unity-Good. How, then,
is it present?

<P>By the mode of parts.

<P>But The Good is without parts?

<P>No doubt The Good is a unity; but here it has become
particularized. The First Activity is good and anything determined
in accord with it is good as also is any resultant. There is the
good that is good by origin in The First, the good that is in an
ordered system derived from that earlier, and the good that is in
the actualization [in the thing participant]. Derived, then, not
identical- like the speech and walk and other characteristics of one
man, each playing its due part.

<P>Here, it is obvious, goodness depends upon order, 
rhythm, but what
equivalent exists There?

<P>We might answer that in the case of the sense-order, 
too, the good
is imposed since the ordering is of things different from the
Orderer but that There the very things are good.

<P>But why are they thus good in themselves? We cannot be content
with the conviction of their goodness on the ground of their 
origin in
that realm: we do not deny that things deriving Thence are good, but
our subject demands that we discover the mode by which they come to
possess that goodness.
