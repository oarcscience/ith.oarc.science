<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Section 16</H4>

<P>16. When each of the entities bound up with the pseudo-substance
is taken apart from the rest, the name of Quality is given 
to that one
among them, by which without pointing to essence or quantity 
or motion
we signify the distinctive mark, the type or aspect of a thing- for
example, the beauty or ugliness of a body. This beauty- need we
say?- is identical in name only with Intellectual Beauty: it follows
that the term "Quality" as applied to the Sensible and the
Intellectual is necessarily equivocal; even blackness and whiteness
are different in the two spheres.

<P>But the beauty in the germ, in the particular 
Reason-Principle- is
this the same as the manifested beauty, or do they coincide only in
name? Are we to assign this beauty- and the same question applies to
deformity in the soul- to the Intellectual order, or to the
Sensible? That beauty is different in the two spheres is by 
now clear.
If it be embraced in Sensible Quality, then virtue must also be
classed among the qualities of the lower. But merely some 
virtues will
take rank as Sensible, others as Intellectual qualities.

<P>It may even be doubted whether the arts, as 
Reason-Principles, can
fairly be among Sensible qualities; Reason-Principles, it is 
true, may
reside in Matter, but "matter" for them means Soul. On the 
other hand,
their being found in company with Matter commits them in some degree
to the lower sphere. Take the case of lyrical music: it is performed
upon strings; melody, which may be termed a part of the art, is
sensuous sound- though, perhaps, we should speak here not of 
parts but
of manifestations [Acts]: yet, called manifestations, they are
nonetheless sensuous. The beauty inherent in body is similarly
bodiless; but we have assigned it to the order of things 
bound up with
body and subordinate to it.

<P>Geometry and arithmetic are, we shall maintain, of a twofold
character; in their earthly types they rank with Sensible 
Quality, but
in so far as they are functions of pure Soul, they necessarily
belong to that other world in close proximity to the Intellectual.
This, too, is in Plato's view the case with music and astronomy.

<P>The arts concerned with material objects and making use of
perceptible instruments and sense-perception must be classed with
Sensible Quality, even though they are dispositions of the Soul,
attendant upon its apostasy.

<P>There is also every reason for consigning to this category the
practical virtues whose function is directed to a social 
end: these do
not isolate Soul by inclining it towards the higher; their
manifestation makes for beauty in this world, a beauty 
regarded not as
necessary but as desirable.

<P>On this principle, the beauty in the germ, and still more the
blackness and whiteness in it, will be included among Sensible
Qualities.

<P>Are we, then, to rank the individual soul, as containing these
Reason-Principles, with Sensible Substance? But we do not even
identify the Principles with body; we merely include them in
Sensible Quality on the ground that they are connected with body and
are activities of body. The constituents of Sensible Substance have
already been specified; we have no intention whatever of adding to
them Substance bodiless.

<P>As for Qualities, we hold that they are invariably 
bodiless, being
affections arising within Soul; but, like the 
Reason-Principles of the
individual soul, they are associated with Soul in its apostasy, and
are accordingly counted among the things of the lower realm: such
affections, torn between two worlds by their objects and their
abode, we have assigned to Quality, which is indeed not bodily but
manifested in body.

<P>But we refrain from assigning Soul to Sensible Substance, on the
ground that we have already referred to Quality [which is Sensible]
those affections of Soul which are related to body. On the contrary,
Soul, conceived apart from affection and Reason-Principle, we have
restored to its origin, leaving in the lower realm no substance
which is in any sense Intellectual.
