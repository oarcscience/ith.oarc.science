<P>6. But how can that higher soul have sense-perception?

<P>It is the perception of what falls under perception There,
sensation in the mode of that realm: it is the source of the soul's
perception of the sense-realm in its correspondence with the
Intellectual. Man as sense-percipient becomes aware of that
correspondence and accommodates the sense-realm to the lowest
extremity of its counterpart There, proceeding from the fire
Intellectual to the fire here which becomes perceptible by 
its analogy
with that of the higher sphere. If material things existed There,
the soul would perceive them; Man in the Intellectual, Man as
Intellectual soul, would be aware of the terrestrial. This is how
the secondary Man, copy of Man in the Intellectual, contains the
Reason-Principles in copy; and Man in the Intellectual-Principle
contained the Man that existed before any man. The diviner shines
out upon the secondary and the secondary upon the tertiary; and even
the latest possesses them all- not in the sense of actually living
by them all but as standing in under-parallel to them. Some of us
act by this lowest; in another rank there is a double activity, a
trace of the higher being included; in yet another there is 
a blending
of the third grade with the others: each is that Man by which he
acts while each too contains all the grades, though in some sense
not so. On the separation of the third life and third Man from the
body, then if the second also departs- of course not losing hold on
the Above- the two, as we are told, will occupy the same place. No
doubt it seems strange that a soul which has been the 
Reason-Principle
of a man should come to occupy the body of an animal: but 
the soul has
always been all, and will at different times be this and that.

<P>Pure, not yet fallen to evil, the soul chooses man and 
is man, for
this is the higher, and it produces the higher. It produces also the
still loftier beings, the Celestials [Daimons], who are of one Form
with the soul that makes Man: higher still stands that Man more
entirely of the Celestial rank, almost a god, reproducing God, a
Celestial closely bound to God as a man is to Man. For that 
Being into
which man develops is not to be called a god; there remains the
difference which distinguishes souls, all of the same race 
though they
be. This is taking "Celestial" ["Daimon"] in the sense of Plato.

<P>When a soul which in the human state has been thus attached
chooses animal nature and descends to that, it is giving forth the
Reason-Principle- necessarily in it- of that particular animal: this
lower it contained and the activity has been to the lower.
