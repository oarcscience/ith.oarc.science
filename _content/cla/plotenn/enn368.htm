<P>3. For the most convincing proof that vision does not depend
upon the transmission of impressions of any kind made upon 
the air, we
have only to consider that in the darkness of night we can see a
fire and the stars and their very shapes.

<P>No one will pretend that these forms are reproduced upon the
darkness and come to us in linked progression; if the fire thus
rayed out its own form, there would be an end to the darkness. In
the blackest night, when the very stars are hidden and show no gleam
of their light, we can see the fire of the beacon-stations and of
maritime signal-towers.

<P>Now if, in defiance of all that the senses tell us, we are to
believe that in these examples the fire [as light] traverses the
air, then, in so far as anything is visible, it must be that dimmed
reproduction in the air, not the fire itself. But if an object can
be seen on the other side of some intervening darkness, much more
would it be visible with nothing intervening.

<P>We may hold one thing certain: the impossibility of 
vision without
an intervening substance does not depend upon that absence in
itself: the sole reason is that, with the absence, there would be an
end to the sympathy reigning in the living whole and relating the
parts to each other in an existent unity.

<P>Perception of every kind seems to depend on the fact that our
universe is a whole sympathetic to itself: that it is so, 
appears from
the universal participation in power from member to member, and
especially in remote power.

<P>No doubt it would be worth enquiry- though we pass it for the
present- what would take place if there were another kosmos, another
living whole having no contact with this one, and the far ridges of
our heavens had sight: would our sphere see that other as from a
mutually present distance, or could there be no dealing at all from
this to that?

<P>To return; there is a further consideration showing that sight
is not brought about by this alleged modification of the 
intervenient.

<P>Any modification of the air substance would necessarily be
corporeal: there must be such an impression as is made upon sealing
wax. But this would require that each part of the object of vision
be impressed on some corresponding portion of the intervenient: the
intervenient, however, in actual contact with the eye would be just
that portion whose dimensions the pupil is capable of receiving. But
as a matter of fact the entire object appears before the 
pupil; and it
is seen entire by all within that air space for a great extent, in
front, sideways, close at hand, from the back, as long as the line
of vision is not blocked. This shows that any given portion 
of the air
contains the object of vision, in face view so to speak, 
and, at once,
we are confronted by no merely corporeal phenomena; the facts are
explicable only as depending upon the greater laws, the spiritual,
of a living being one and self-sensitive.
