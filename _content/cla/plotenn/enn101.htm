<P>3. The truth may be resumed in this way:

<P>There is a lowest power of the Soul, a nearest to earth, and
this is interwoven throughout the entire universe: another phase
possesses sensation, while yet another includes the Reason which is
concerned with the objects of sensation: this higher phase holds
itself to the spheres, poised towards the Above but hovering over
the lesser Soul and giving forth to it an effluence which makes it
more intensely vital.

<P>The lower Soul is moved by the higher which, besides encircling
and supporting it, actually resides in whatsoever part of it has
thrust upwards and attained the spheres. The lower then, ringed
round by the higher and answering its call, turns and tends towards
it; and this upward tension communicates motion to the material
frame in which it is involved: for if a single point in a 
spheric mass
is in any degree moved, without being drawn away from the rest, it
moves the whole, and the sphere is set in motion. Something of the
same kind happens in the case of our bodies: the unspatial 
movement of
the Soul- in happiness, for instance, or at the idea of some
pleasant event- sets up a spatial movement in the body: the Soul,
attaining in its own region some good which increases its sense of
life, moves towards what pleases it; and so, by force of the union
established in the order of nature, it moves the body, in the body's
region, that is in space.

<P>As for that phase of the Soul in which sensation is vested, it,
too, takes its good from the Supreme above itself and moves,
rejoicingly, in quest of it: and since the object of its desire is
everywhere, it too ranges always through the entire scope of the
universe.

<P>The Intellectual-Principle has no such progress in any 
region; its
movement is a stationary act, for it turns upon itself.

<P>And this is why the All, circling as it does, is at the same
time at rest.
