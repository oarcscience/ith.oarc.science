<P>5. There is, then a Providence, which permeates the Kosmos from
first to last, not everywhere equal, as in a numerical distribution,
but proportioned, differing, according to the grades of 
place- just as
in some one animal, linked from first to last, each member 
has its own
function, the nobler organ the higher activity while others
successively concern the lower degrees of the life, each part acting
of itself, and experiencing what belongs to its own nature and what
comes from its relation with every other. Strike, and what 
is designed
for utterance gives forth the appropriate volume of sound while
other parts take the blow in silence but react in their own especial
movement; the total of all the utterance and action and receptivity
constitutes what we may call the personal voice, life and history of
the living form. The parts, distinct in Kind, have distinct 
functions:
the feet have their work and the eyes theirs; the 
understanding serves
to one end, the Intellectual Principle to another.

<P>But all sums to a unity, a comprehensive Providence. From the
inferior grade downwards is Fate: the upper is Providence alone: for
in the Intellectual Kosmos all is Reason-Principle or its
Priors-Divine Mind and unmingled Soul-and immediately upon these
follows Providence which rises from Divine Mind, is the 
content of the
Unmingled Soul, and, through this Soul, is communicated to the
Sphere of living things.

<P>This Reason-Principle comes as a thing of unequal parts, and
therefore its creations are unequal, as, for example, the several
members of one Living Being. But after this allotment of rank and
function, all act consonant with the will of the gods keeps the
sequence and is included under the providential government, for the
Reason-Principle of providence is god-serving.

<P>All such right-doing, then, is linked to Providence; but 
it is not
therefore performed by it: men or other agents, living or lifeless,
are causes of certain things happening, and any good that may result
is taken up again by Providence. In the total, then, the right rules
and what has happened amiss is transformed and corrected. Thus, to
take an example from a single body, the Providence of a living
organism implies its health; let it be gashed or otherwise wounded,
and that Reason-Principle which governs it sets to work to draw it
together, knit it anew, heal it, and put the affected part to rights.

<P>In sum, evil belongs to the sequence of things, but it comes
from necessity. It originates in ourselves; it has its causes no
doubt, but we are not, therefore, forced to it by Providence: some
of these causes we adapt to the operation of Providence and of its
subordinates, but with others we fail to make the connection; the
act instead of being ranged under the will of Providence consults
the desire of the agent alone or of some other element in the
Universe, something which is either itself at variance with 
Providence
or has set up some such state of variance in ourselves.

<P>The one circumstance does not produce the same result wherever
it acts; the normal operation will be modified from case to case:
Helen's beauty told very differently on Paris and on Idomeneus;
bring together two handsome people of loose character and two living
honourably and the resulting conduct is very different; a good man
meeting a libertine exhibits a distinct phase of his nature and,
similarly, the dissolute answer to the society of their betters.

<P>The act of the libertine is not done by Providence or in
accordance with Providence; neither is the action of the good done
by Providence- it is done by the man- but it is done in accordance
with Providence, for it is an act consonant with the 
Reason-Principle.
Thus a patient following his treatment is himself an agent and yet
is acting in accordance with the doctor's method inspired by the art
concerned with the causes of health and sickness: what one does
against the laws of health is one's act, but an act conflicting with
the Providence of medicine.
