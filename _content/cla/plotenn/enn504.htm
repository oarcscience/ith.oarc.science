<P>13. It remains to decide whether only what is known in sense
exists There or whether, on the contrary, as Absolute-Man 
differs from
individual man, so there is in the Supreme an Absolute-Soul
differing from Soul and an Absolute-Intellect differing from
Intellectual-Principle.

<P>It must be stated at the outset that we cannot take all that is
here to be image of archetype, or Soul to be an image of
Absolute-Soul: one soul, doubtless, ranks higher than another, but
here too, though perhaps not as identified with this realm, is the
Absolute-Soul.

<P>Every soul, authentically a soul, has some form of rightness and
moral wisdom; in the souls within ourselves there is true 
knowing: and
these attributes are no images or copies from the Supreme, as in the
sense-world, but actually are those very originals in a mode
peculiar to this sphere. For those Beings are not set apart in some
defined place; wherever there is a soul that has risen from body,
there too these are: the world of sense is one- where, the
Intellectual Kosmos is everywhere. Whatever the freed soul attains
to here, that it is There.

<P>Thus, if by the content of the sense-world we mean simply the
visible objects, then the Supreme contains not only what is in the
realm of sense but more: if in the content of the kosmos we mean to
include Soul and the Soul-things, then all is here that is There.
