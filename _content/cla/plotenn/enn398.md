#### Section 15

15\. (20) Thus far we have offered the considerations appropriate to
those asking for demonstration: those whose need is conviction by
evidence of the more material order are best met from the abundant
records relevant to the subject: there are also the oracles of the Gods
ordering the appeasing of wronged souls and the honouring of the dead as
still sentient, a practice common to all mankind: and again, not a few
souls, once among men, have continued to serve them after quitting the
body and by revelations, practically helpful, make clear, as well, that
the other souls, too, have not ceased to be.
