<P>5. Are we, however, to make freedom and self-disposal 
exclusive to
Intellectual-Principle as engaged in its characteristic Act,
Intellectual-Principle unassociated, or do they belong also to soul
acting under that guidance and performing act of virtue?

<P>If freedom is to be allowed to soul in its Act, it certainly
cannot be allowed in regard to issue, for we are not master 
of events:
if in regard to fine conduct and all inspired by
Intellectual-Principle, that may very well be freedom; but is the
freedom ours?

<P>Because there is war, we perform some brave feat; how is that
our free act since had there been no war it could not have been
performed? So in all cases of fine conduct; there is always some
impinging event leading out our quality to show itself in 
this or that
act. And suppose virtue itself given the choice whether to find
occasion for its exercise- war evoking courage; wrong, so that it
may establish justice and good order; poverty that it may show
independence- or to remain inactive, everything going well, it would
choose the peace of inaction, nothing calling for its intervention,
just as a physician like Hippocrates would prefer no one to stand in
need of his skill.

<P>If thus virtue whose manifestation requires action becomes
inevitably a collaborator under compulsion, how can it have
untrammelled self-disposal?

<P>Should we, perhaps, distinguish between compulsion in the act
and freedom in the preceding will and reasoning?

<P>But in setting freedom in those preceding functions, we 
imply that
virtue has a freedom and self-disposal apart from all act; then we
must state what is the reality of the self-disposal attributed to
virtue as state or disposition. Are we to put it that virtue comes
in to restore the disordered soul, taming passions and appetites? In
what sense, at that, can we hold our goodness to be our own free
act, our fine conduct to be uncompelled? In that we will and 
adopt, in
that this entry of virtue prepares freedom and self-disposal, ending
our slavery to the masters we have been obeying. If then 
virtue is, as
it were, a second Intellectual-Principle, and heightens the soul to
Intellectual quality, then, once more, our freedom is found 
to lie not
in act but in Intellectual-Principle immune from act.
