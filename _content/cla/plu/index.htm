<P>
Plutarch was born in 46 C.E. in Chaeronea, in Boeotia, Greece,
and died about 119-127.
He was one of the two priests of Apollo at the Oracle of Delphi.
His skills as a writer and speaker brought him
fame in the first century Roman Empire.
Often cited in other books at this site, of interest are
the extensive passages where he discusses
puzzling points about ancient Paganism.
In spite of his priestly background, Plutarch was a bit of
a free thinker, and loved to speculate multiple explanations
for natural and cultural phenomena.
As such, he is one of the predecessors of modern social science.
