<p>30. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Why</span> do they, as they conduct the bride to her home, bid her say, "Where you are Gaius, there am I Gaia"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_68"></A><A HREF="#fn_68"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>?</p>  
<p>Is her entrance into the house upon fixed terms, as it were, at once to share everything and to control jointly the household, and is the meaning, then, "Wherever you are lord and master, there am I lady and mistress"? These names are in common use also in other connexions, just as jurists speak of Gaius Seius and Lucius Titius,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_69"></A><A HREF="#fn_69"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A> and philosophers of Dion and Theon.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_70"></A><A HREF="#fn_70"><FONT SIZE="1">c</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Or do they use these names because of Gaia Caecilia,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_71"></A><A HREF="#fn_71"><FONT SIZE="1">d</FONT></A> consort of one of Tarquin's sons, a fair and virtuous woman, whose statue in bronze stands in the temple of Sanctus?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">e</FONT></A> And both her sandals and her spindle were, in ancient days, dedicated there as tokens of her love of home and of her industry respectively.</p>  
<p>

<p>31. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Why</span> is the far-famed "Talassio"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_73"></A><A HREF="#fn_73"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A> sung at the marriage ceremony?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_74"></A><A HREF="#fn_74"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Is it derived from <i>talasia</i> (spinning)? For they call the wool-basket (<i>talaros</i>) <i>talasus</i>. When they lead in the bride, they spread a fleece beneath her; she herself brings with her a distaff and her spindle, and wreaths her husband's door with wool.</p>  
<p>Or is the statement of the historians true? They relate that there was a certain young man, brilliant in military achievements and valuable in other ways, whose name was Talasius; and when the Romans were carrying off the daughters of the Sabines who had come to see the games, a maiden of particularly beautiful appearance was being carried off for him by some plebeian retainers of his. To protect their enterprise and to prevent anyone from approaching and trying to wrest the maiden from them, they shouted continually that she was being brought as a wife for Talasius (<i>Talasio</i>). Since, therefore, everyone honoured Talasius, they followed along and provided escort, joining in the good wishes and acclamations. Wherefore since Talasius's marriage was happy, they became accustomed to invoke Talasius in other marriages also, even as the Greeks invoke Hymen.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>32. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Why</span> is it that in the month of May at the time of. the full moon they throw into the river from the Pons Sublicius figures of men, calling the images thrown Argives?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_75"></A><A HREF="#fn_75"><FONT SIZE="1">c</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Is it because in ancient days the barbarians who</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="green">p. 56</font></A> <a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="green">p. 57</font></A></p>  
<p>lived in these parts used to destroy thus the Greeks whom they captured? But Hercules, who was much admired by them, put an end to their murder of strangers and taught them to throw figures into the river, in imitation of their superstitious custom. The men of old used to call all Greeks alike Argives; unless it be, indeed, since the Arcadians regarded the Argives also as their enemies because of their immediate proximity, that, when Evander and his men&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_76"></A><A HREF="#fn_76"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A> fled from Greece and settled here, they continued to preserve their ancient feud and enmity.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>33. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Why</span> in ancient days did they never dine out without their sons, even when these were still but children?</p>  
<p>Did Lycurgus introduce this custom also, and bring boys to the common meals that they might become accustomed to conduct themselves toward their pleasures, not in a brutish or disorderly way, but with discretion, since they had their elders as supervisors and spectators, as it were? No less important is the fact that the fathers themselves would also be more decorous and prudent in the presence of their sons; for "where the old are shameless," as Plato&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_77"></A><A HREF="#fn_77"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A> remarks, "there the young also must needs be lost to all sense of shame."</p>  
<p>34. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Why</span> is it that while the other Romans make libations and offerings to the dead in the month of February, Decimus Brutus, as Cicero&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">c</FONT></A> has recorded, used to do so in the month of December? This was</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="green">p. 58</font></A> <a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="green">p. 59</font></A></p>  
<p>the Brutus who invaded Lusitania, and was the first to visit those remote places, and cross the river Leth&ecirc; with an army.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_79"></A><A HREF="#fn_79"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Since most peoples are accustomed to make offerings to the dead at the close of the day and at the end of the month, is it not reasonable also to honour the dead in the last month&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_80"></A><A HREF="#fn_80"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A> at the turn of the year? And December is the last month.</p>  
<p>Or do these honours belong to deities beneath the earth, and is it the proper season to honour these deities when all the crops have attained consummation?</p>  
<p>Or is it most fitting to remember those below when men are stirring the earth at the beginning of seed-time?</p>  
<p>Or is it because this month has been consecrated to Saturn by the Romans, and they regard Saturn as an infernal, not a celestial god?</p>  
<p>Or is it that then their greatest festival, the Saturnalia, is set; and it is reputed to contain the most numerous social gatherings and enjoyments, and therefore Brutus deemed it proper to bestow upon the dead first-fruits, as it were, of this festival also?</p>  
<p>Or is this statement, that Brutus alone sacrificed to the dead in this month, altogether a falsehood? For it is in December that they make offerings to Larentia and bring libations to her sepulchre.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>35. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">And</span> why do they thus honour Larentia who was at one time a courtesan?</p>  
<p>They record that there was another Larentia, Acca,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_81"></A><A HREF="#fn_81"><FONT SIZE="1">c</FONT></A> the nurse of Romulus, whom they honour in</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="green">p. 60</font></A> <a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="green">p. 61</font></A></p>  
<p>the month of April. But they say that the surname of the courtesan Larentia was Fabula. She became famous for the following reason&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_82"></A><A HREF="#fn_82"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>: a certain keeper of the temple of Hercules enjoyed, it seems, considerable leisure and had the habit of spending the greater part of the day at draughts and dice; and one day, as it chanced, there was present no one of those who were wont to play with him and share the occupation of his leisure. So, in his boredom, he challenged the god to throw dice with him on fixed terms, as it were: if he should win, he was to obtain some service from the god; but if he should lose, he was to furnish a supper for the god at his own expense and provide a comely girl to spend the night with him. Thereupon he brought out the dice, and threw once for himself and once for the god, and lost. Abiding, therefore, by the terms of his challenge he prepared a somewhat sumptuous repast for the god and fetched Larentia, who openly practised the profession of courtesan. He feasted her, put her to bed in the temple, and, when he departed, locked the doors. The tale is told that the god visited her in the night, not in mortal wise, and bade her on the morrow go into the forum, and pay particular attention to the first man she met, and make him her friend. Larentia arose, therefore, and, going forth, met one of the wealthy men that were unwed and past their prime, whose name was Tarrutius. With this man she became acquainted, and while he lived she presided over his household, and when he died, she inherited his estate; and later, when she herself</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_62"><font size="1" color="green">p. 62</font></A> <a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="green">p. 63</font></A></p>  
<p>died, she left her property to the State; and for that reason she has these honours.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>36. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Why</span> do they call one of the gates the Window, for this is what <i>fenestra</i> means; and why is the so-called Chamber of Fortune beside it?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_83"></A><A HREF="#fn_83"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Is it because King Servius, the luckiest of mortals, was reputed to have converse with Fortune, who visited him through a window?</p>  
<p>Or is this but a fable, and is the true reason that when King Tarquinius Priscus died, his wife Tanaquil, a sensible and a queenly woman, put her head out of a window and, addressing the citizens, persuaded them to appoint Servius king, and thus the place came to have this name?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>37. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Why</span> is it that of all the things dedicated to the gods it is the custom to allow only spoils of war to disintegrate with the passage of time, and not to move them beforehand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_85"></A><A HREF="#fn_85"><FONT SIZE="1">c</FONT></A> nor repair them?</p>  
<p>Is it in order that men may believe that their repute deserts them at the same time with the obliteration of their early memorials, and may ever seek to bring in some fresh reminder of valour?</p>  
<p>Or is it rather that, as time makes dim the memorials of their dissension with their enemies, it would be invidious and malicious to restore and renew them? Nor among the Greeks, either, do</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="green">p. 64</font></A> <a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="green">p. 65</font></A></p>  
<p>they that first erected a trophy of stone or of bronze&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A> stand in good repute.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>38. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Why</span> did Quintus Metellus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A> when he became <i>pontifex maximus</i>, with his reputation for good sense in all other matters as well as in his statesmanship, prevent divination from birds after the month Sextilis, which is now called August?</p>  
<p>Is it that, even as we attend to such matters in the middle of the day or at dawn, or in the beginning of the month when the moon is waxing, and avoid the declining days and hours as unsuitable for business, so likewise did Metellus regard the period of time after the first eight months as the evening or late afternoon, so to speak, of the year, since then it is declining and waning?</p>  
<p>Or is it because we should observe birds when they are in their prime and in perfect condition? And this they are before the summer-time; but towards autumn some are weak and sickly, others but nestlings and not full-grown, and still others have vanished completely, migrating because of the time of year.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>39. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Why</span> were men who were not regularly enlisted, but merely tarrying in the camp, not allowed to throw missiles at the enemy or to wound them?</p>  
<p>This fact Cato the Elder&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">c</FONT></A> has made clear in one of his letters to his son, in which he bids the young man to return home if he has completed his term of service and has been discharged; or, if he should</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_66"><font size="1" color="green">p. 66</font></A> <a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="green">p. 67</font></A></p>  
<p>stay over, to obtain permission from his general to wound or slay an enemy.</p>  
<p>Is it because sheer necessity alone constitutes a warrant to kill a human being, and he who does so illegally and without the word of command is a murderer? For this reason Cyrus also praised Chrysantas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_89"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A> who, when he was about to kill an enemy, and had his weapon raised to strike, heard the recall sounded and let the man go without striking him, believing that he was now prevented from so doing.</p>  
<p>Or must he who grapples with the enemy and fights not be free from accountability nor go unscathed should he play the coward? For he does not help so much by hitting or wounding an enemy as he does harm by fleeing or retreating. He, therefore, who has been discharged from service is freed from military regulations; but he who asks leave to perform the offices of a soldier renders himself again accountable to the regulations and to his general.</p>
