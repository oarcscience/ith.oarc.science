### INTRODUCTION

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> the Greek Questions, as in the Roman
Questions, Plutarch endeavours to give the reason or explanation of
fifty-nine matters concerned with Greek life. The vast majority of them
are customs or names and, as the explanations are usually historical,
they often go back to very early times. A full commentary may be found
in W. R. Halliday, *The Greek Questions of Plutarch* (Oxford, 1928), an
excellent work, embodying also much of the modern speculation in regard
to primitive religion.

The sources for the information contained in this essay seem to be
somewhat varied, but there is little doubt that Aristotle's account of
the numerous *Greek Constitutions* was Plutarch's principal source. The
matter is treated at length by Halliday.

J. J. Hartman (*Mnemosyne*, xli. p. 216, or *De Plutarcho scriptore et
philosopho*, p. 139) is the only modern scholar who has doubted the
authenticity of the attribution to Plutarch of this work <span
id="fr_269"></span>[a](#fn_269); the author was not primarily interested
in ethical matters, according to Hartman, and hence cannot be Plutarch.
J. B. Titchener <span id="fr_270"></span>[b](#fn_270) has promised a
discussion of this

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

matter, but stylistic considerations alone seem to make it uncertain
whether the work is correctly attributed to Plutarch.

A few of the topics treated in the *Greek Questions* appear also in
other works of Plutarch, but the number naturally is not large.

The <span class="smallcaps">MS</span>. tradition is good; the few
difficulties found are generally with single words.

The work is No. 166 in Lamprias's list of Plutarch's works, where the
title is given as Αἰτίαι Ἐλλήνων.
