<p align="center"><i></i><A HREF="pte00.htm#img_title">Title Page.</A></p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Diana</span> of the Ephesians, a palm-branch in each hand, a hind on each side, looking up to her as their mistress: in the field over head, two scorpions. This deity originally symbolized Earth, and was actually identified with Isis; but in later times, being called by the name of the Grecian Artemis, she similarly became the President of the Moon. Trebellius Pollio therefore speaks of the Goths burning the Temple of the "Luna Ephesia," in the reign of Gallienus. (Black Jasper.)</p>  
<p>P. <A HREF="pte01.htm#page_v">v</A>. A group of the chief attributes of Apollo, in his double character. The Gryphon, composed of the lion and eagle (types of solar power), grasps the lyre belonging to the god of Poetry, whilst on the Delphic rock behind is perched the raven, the most sure prophet of all birds of augury. (Amethyst.)</p>  
<p>P. <A HREF="pte01.htm#page_viii">viii</A>. Apollo seated before the Delphic tripod, wearing the topknot and flowing robe alluded to by Plutarch (<A HREF="pte06.htm#page_165">p. 165</A>). He takes the title of "Musagetes" when arrayed in this costume; which therefore became the professional dress of all musicians. Nero, who thought himself the Roman Apollo, appeared in statues and struck coins (still extant) with his own figure "cithar&#339;dico habitu," as Suetonius has recorded. (Sard.)</p>  
<p>P. <A HREF="pte04.htm#page_71">71</A>. Bust of Isis, with the lotus-flower on her forehead, and the sceptre in her hand. (Sard.)</p>  
<p>P. <A HREF="pte05.htm#page_137">137</A>. Apollo standing in front of the Delphic tripod. The inscription <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">LAUR. MED.</span> shows that the gem once belonged to Lorenzo de&#8217; Medici. (Sard.)</p>  
<p>P. <A HREF="pte06.htm#page_172">172</A>. The Pythia, seated in profound meditation in front of the Tripod. (Antique Paste.)</p>  
<p>P. <A HREF="pte07.htm#page_196">196</A>. The Delphic E, "of gold," as the inscription declares. This symbol became a talisman in much request amongst the Romans, for reasons sufficiently obvious to any one who reads Plutarch's exposition of its meaning. (Cameo.)</p>  
<p>P. <A HREF="pte09.htm#page_275">275</A>. Erinnys, the Avenger of Blood, hastening in pursuit of the guilty. Archaic Greek style. (Sard.)</p>  
<p>P. <A HREF="pte10.htm#page_278">278</A>. Apollo, seated in the attitude of meditation: by his side stands the earliest Pythia, Herophile; the staff is placed in her hand to symbolize her extreme age. (Sard.)</p>  
<p><a name="page_xii"><font size="1" color="green">p. xii</font></A></p>  
<p>P. <A HREF="pte11.htm#page_287">287</A>. "Deus Lunus," the Asiatic conception of the Spirit of the Moon. The earliest of all, the Assyrian, embodied the idea in the form of an aged man, "Sin," leaning on his staff, and almost the counterpart of our popular notion of the "Man in the Moon;" but in process of time it was softened down into the effeminate boy represented on the present gem. The chief seat of his worship was Carrh&aelig; in Mesopotamia, where it flourished down to a late period of the Roman Empire: for Julian paid him worship there, "after the established custom," as he marched by on his Persian expedition. (Sard.)</p>
