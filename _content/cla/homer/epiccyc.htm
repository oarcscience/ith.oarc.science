beside Oedipus a rich table of silver which once belonged to
Cadmus the divinely wise: next he filled a fine golden cup with
sweet wine.  But when Oedipus perceived these treasures of his
father, great misery fell on his heart, and he straight-way
called down bitter curses there in the presence of both his sons.
<P>
And the avenging Fury of the gods failed not to hear him as he
prayed that they might never divide their father's goods in
loving brotherhood, but that war and fighting might be ever the
portion of them both.'
<P>
<P>
Fragment #3 --

of Hades.'

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE EPIGONI (fragments)</H3>

Next (Homer composed) the "Epigoni" in seven thousand verses,
beginning, `And now, Muses, let us begin to sing of younger men.'
<P>

Fragment #2 --
Photius, Lexicon:
Teumesia.  Those who have written on Theban affairs have given a
full account of the Teumesian fox. (1)  They relate that the
creature was sent by the gods to punish the descendants of
Cadmus, and that the Thebans therefore excluded those of the
house of Cadmus from kingship.  But (they say) a certain
Cephalus, the son of Deion, an Athenian, who owned a hound which
no beast ever escaped, had accidentally killed his wife Procris,
and being purified of the homicide by the Cadmeans, hunted the
fox with his hound, and when they had overtaken it both hound and
fox were turned into stones near Teumessus.  These writers have
taken the story from the Epic Cycle.
<P>
<P>
Fragment #3 --
Scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius, Arg. i. 308:
The authors of the "Thebais" say that Manto the daughter of
Teiresias was sent to Delphi by the Epigoni as a first fruit of
their spoil, and that in accordance with an oracle of Apollo she
went out and met Rhacius, the son of Lebes, a Mycenaean by race. 
This man she married -- for the oracle also contained the command
that she should marry whomsoever she might meet -- and coming to
Colophon, was there much cast down and wept over the destruction
of her country.
