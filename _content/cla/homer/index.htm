For over three centuries scholars have debated whether an actual person
named Homer existed; some have speculated that
the name Homer is actually a collective name for a group of bards
(the Homeridae) who redacted (edited) a existing cycle
of oral epics about 800 B.C.E.
Others believe, based on textual evidence, that one person did
compose or redact the two major Homeric compositions.
In any case, stating an opinion about this question would be a good way to
start a bar fight at a conference of classical scholars....</P>

<P>
Certainly, there are few details about Homer's life.
According to classical sources, Homer lived around 1200 B.C.E.;
today dates of the 8th or 7th Century B.C.E. are quoted.
Homer is traditionally described as being blind--based on one 
Archaic Greek fragment--but the visual
quality of his work makes this hard to believe; perhaps he
became blind later in life.</P>


<P>
The Homeric cycle was composed around the same time as
the Indian <A HREF="../../hin/rama/index.htm">Ramayana</A>, which it resembles
thematically.
The entire Homeric cycle, of which the <A HREF="#homer">Iliad and Odyssey</A>
are the only complete surviving works, included
dozens of books composed by Homer and others. 
Some fragments of this cycle are included <A HREF="#homerica">below</A>.
</P>

<P>
The Illiad is based on events which probably occurred around 1000 B.C.E.
The Mycenean Greeks of this era were contemporaries with a Bronze age
city in Asia Minor on the Aegean coast of what today is Turkey.
Both these cultures employed megalithic architecture.
Heinrich Schliemann, a German archeologist
in the early 20th Century, excavated both Mycenae in the Peloponessus
region of Greece, and another site in western Turkey which he identified as
the actual city of Troy.
'Troy' was destroyed (sometimes by fire)
and rebuilt--not once, but multiple times--and
resembles closely the description of Troy in the Iliad.
Whether the events in the Iliad are literally true
in some sense is still unknown.
The Odyssey, on the other hand, is pure fiction, and one must strain
to correlate its plot with any actual geography or history; it has been
called the first science fiction novel.</P>
<P>
In any case, these stories remain the most
ancient European literature that we have intact;
because of their lively pacing and vivid characters
they still have strong appeal for modern readers.

The following are fragments written by other authors in
antiquity on the subject of the Homeric epic and Homer; some of these
were spuriously attributed to Homer.
These are remnants of a huge epic cycle which encompassed
the whole mythological and legendary history of the Greeks, of which
the battle for Troy is the centerpiece.
The cycle was never completely canonized, and as late as classical
Roman times <A HREF="../virgil/aen/index.htm">Virgils' Aeneid</A>
added yet another epic poem to the collection.
It seems that sequels and prequels were just as popular in Ancient
Greece as in modern Hollywood...</P>

<P>These are from <CITE>Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns and Homerica</CITE>
by Hugh G. Evelyn-White, [1914] (Loeb Classics #57).
The other portions of this book are presented above on this page,
and in the <A HREF="../hesiod/index.htm">Hesiod section</A>;
this etext was scanned as the
Online Medieval and Classical Library Release #8
by Douglas B. Killings, and is also available from the Gutenburg Project.</P>
