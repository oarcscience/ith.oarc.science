<p><A NAME="page_250"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 250</FONT></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>  <h4 align="center">THE TWELVE POSITIONS OF URANUS, OR HERSCHEL.</h4>  
<p align="center">&#x2645; (<i>Uranus</i>)<i>: its Function</i>.</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">This</span> is the farthest from the sun of any planet we use. Its influence is almost entirely of a metaphysical character; therefore, in dealing with this planet, we find that it affects the physical body only in the sublimated life forces, preparing them for the higher metaphysical uses. Its real nature and influence cannot be fully expressed by any organism on this planet; therefore it produces very strange effects upon the mind and life; and its influence is less potent than that of any other planet, except when it is in the life; that is, in conjunction with the earth at the time of birth. It is also potent in Libra and Scorpio; for as it revolves in an opposite direction from the other planets, it also acts in an opposite direction upon the life forces, turning the sex inclinations away from expression in that function, and directing them upward for the uses of the brain. The same is true, more or less, in all the signs and functions; for it serves as a depolarizer, turning the forces away from the animal, toward the spiritual.</p>  
<p align="center">&#x2645; (<i>Uranus</i>) <i>in</i> &#x2648; (<i>Aries</i>).</p>  
<p>This stirs the mind to activity, and gives a clear idea of the unseen, a love for the spiritual, and a desire for philosophical and metaphysical research and the study of causes. It leads the mental tendencies almost entirely in that direction.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_251"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 251</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center">&#x2645; (<i>Uranus</i>) <i>in</i> &#x2649; (<i>Taurus</i>).</p>  
<p>This gives very fine psychometrical abilities, enabling those who are highly unfolded to feel and perceive the physical and mental conditions of others, and even to read their thoughts; but to those who are controlled by their physical nature, it will create carelessness in regard to dress and personal appearance, a love for the antique, for weird music and amusements, an inclination toward fortune-telling, and faith in mysterious predictions.</p>  
<p align="center">&#x2645; (<i>Uranus</i>) <i>in</i> &#x264A; (<i>Gemini</i>).</p>  
<p>This imparts a desire to study and deal with the finer forces in nature, and a disposition towards the occult philosophies. It gives to speakers strong metaphysical characteristics in all their thoughts and sayings, and inclination to teach the laws of mind.</p>  
<p align="center">&#x2645; (<i>Uranus</i>) <i>in</i> &#x264B; (<i>Cancer</i>).</p>  
<p>This gives a person very peculiar, weird, and unexplainable fancies relating to domestic life, and frequently a desire to possess antique and strange pictures. This is liable to be controlled in almost any direction; therefore we must be guided by other conditions in deciding what tendency it would give the life. It is liable to create antagonistic conditions in domestic relations, which, though suppressed, will usually generate in the system tumorous diseases, which are apt to prove fatal. Such persons ought to be very careful never to enter into the more sacred conjugal relations, unless there is perfect harmony between both parties.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_252"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 252</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center">&#x2645; (<i>Uranus</i>) <i>in</i> &#x264C; (<i>Leo</i>).</p>  
<p>This turns all the mental and intuitive inclinations. largely toward the spiritual and metaphysical. It gives an active, imaginative mind, keen and discriminative in its tendencies; refines the feelings and emotions; and gives love of elegance and refinement in every department of life.</p>  
<p>In case of inverted or abnormal sex proclivities, it gives tendency toward vague imaginings and prevarication.</p>  
<p align="center">&#x2645; (<i>Uranus</i>) <i>in</i> &#x264D; (<i>Virgo</i>).</p>  
<p>This affects the digestive organs unfavorably, making the person over-sensitive to the mental conditions of those who are near them at meal time. It gives a strong desire for refined and pure qualities of food, and a liability to many diseases and <A HREF="errata.htm#11">abnormalities</A> arising from antagonistic and inharmonious conditions while eating. It gives a desire for the study of anatomy, physiology, and hygiene, and in the finer and more cultivated organisms it imparts fine metaphysical intuitions. It also creates strong aspirations toward the unseen and unknown.</p>  
<p align="center">&#x2645; (<i>Uranus</i>) <i>in</i> &#x264E; (<i>Libra</i>).</p>  
<p>This position is in harmony with its nature in all particulars. It brightens the perceptive faculties, giving spiritual visions, foresight, and peculiar dreams. It lessens the desire for sexual indulgence, and greatly strengthens the generative organs, causing the person</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_253"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 253</FONT></A></p>  
<p>to conserve the potencies and elements within the body, thus vitalizing, energizing, and refining their whole being.</p>  
<p align="center">&#x2645; (<i>Uranus</i>) <i>in</i> &#x264F; (<i>Scorpio</i>).</p>  
<p>Here, again, it affects the sexual nature, turning the forces back into the body, giving a disinclination to waste them, and power of self-control in that direction. Scorpio receives only the baser principles of this planet; therefore its contributions are limited mainly to pride, self-esteem, conventionality, and approbativeness.</p>  
<p>It also gives a hidden planning and conniving tendency, and even a dishonest disposition to persons on a low plane of life, the true nature of Uranus being distorted through undeveloped conditions.</p>  
<p align="center">&#x2645; (<i>Uranus</i>) <i>in</i> &#x2650; (<i>Sagittarius</i>).</p>  
<p>In this position it slightly improves the mechanical talents of Sagittarius; gives inclination to follow leaders, some veneration for the invisible and unknown, and, if the person is spiritually inclined, the gifts of foresight and spiritual perception. It unites strongly with other characteristics in making persons anxious to know what is going on around them, so that they are sometimes meddlesome.</p>  
<p align="center">&#x2645; (<i>Uranus</i>) <i>in</i> &#x2651; (<i>Capricorn</i>).</p>  
<p>This gives fine business intuitions, and strong desires to study and investigate the more refined forces of nature, from electricity all the way up to the subtile</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_254"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 254</FONT></A></p>  
<p>principles of mind and spirit; sometimes inclining them to make this research the main business of life,&#151;especially where the mechanical dominates.</p>  
<p align="center">&#x2645; (<i>Uranus</i>) <i>in</i> &#x2652; (<i>Aquarius</i>).</p>  
<p>This gives a peculiar disposition to be among the people, and to study their natures, striving constantly to perceive their motives, thoughts, and inclinations, whether consciously or unconsciously to themselves. It gives a disposition to dress uniquely, and to make their own peculiarities stand out prominently in whatever direction they are led; it creates a desire to control others by the mind and will.</p>  
<p align="center">&#x2645; (<i>Uranus</i>) <i>in</i> &#x2653; (<i>Pisces</i>).</p>  
<p>This imparts a strong desire to study and investigate everything relating to the unseen forces in the universe, and increases the person's secretiveness, and gives a restless activity to the mind. It may give love of study in almost any direction; and if the tendency is downward,&#151;toward the base and sensual,&#151;it will give licentious and intemperate inclinations, and a subtle and deceptive disposition.</p>
