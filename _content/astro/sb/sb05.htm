<IMG SRC="img/sep1.jpg"></p>  <h4 align="center">BIBLE HISTORY OF SOLAR BIOLOGY.</h4>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">It</span> may seem strange to some when we tell them that this system is the foundation principle of the whole order of the Hebraic and Christian Bible, which is the Only book wherein we find indications of the prior existence of this science, unless perchance in the Cabalistic writings. But from the first chapter of Genesis to the last chapter of Revelation, we find unquestionable evidence of its having entered into the history of the origin and life of Israel, and the grand prophecies which point forward to the condition or time for which Jesus taught us to pray; viz., that God's kingdom might come, and his will be done on earth as in heaven, are characterized and formulated according to the laws and mechanism of this system.</p>  
<p>We give only a few of the leading points in evidence, in this work, to guide and assist the student, as. suggesting how he may enlarge thereon, and through their agency make more extended research and application of the principles; for this little work is mainly intended to make available the practical, or personal, and business benefits to be derived therefrom. Therefore we do not attempt to elaborate the sublime</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_2"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>lengths, breadths, heights, and depths of this grand system, which far exceeds the grasp and comprehension of the human mind in its present degree of unfoldment. We do, however, give a few conclusive and useful evidences for the benefit of the many sceptics,&#151;whose numbers are rapidly increasing,&#151;with the desire that they may learn and appreciate that in this ancient book (the Bible) there lie many hidden treasures of priceless value, as yet almost wholly unexplored.</p>  
<p>In the first chapter of Genesis we are given the order of the seven ages, and seven stages of the earth's unfoldment, originating by or through the Word of God.</p>  
<p>A word is the concentration and formation of the thought potencies of the thinker, sent out by the will, endowed with all the essences of its author.</p>  
<p>We often hear people remark, "I conceived an idea of such and such a thing," without any apprehension of the great natural truth that thoughts are generated, conceived, and born into existence by the action of the intellectual faculties, as literally as are children, and that the same essences of our life are used for the one that are required for the other; so that it is not merely a fable that God instructed Moses to say to Pharaoh, "Let my son go," and that the natural mind does now, and always has, claimed sonship to God. We have all, from childhood, been familiar with the saying, "We are God's children." Paul affirmed this in its broadest sense when he said, "By the Logos (the Word, or effectual utterance) the worlds were made."</p>  
<p>The Bible attempts but a very brief sketch of the</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_3"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>order and ages of unfoldment up to the time when the first man appeared on the face of the planet, having attained the likeness and image of God, in that he was. able to receive inspiration, and take cognizance of, and think about, God. Thus he stood as the one living; Word or expression of God, as recorded in Genesis i. 26. Thus he became the visible Logos, the one from out of which, we are told, in symbolical language, went four rivers, which form of speech was always used in ancient metaphysics to symbolize the generation of people; thus, four kinds of humanity flowing out from the one, was after the pattern and manner of the heavens.</p>  
<p>As we examine the twelve signs of the zodiac, we find them divided into four heads, or departments, as hereafter explained in this science.</p>  
<p>We have but a faint idea of the progress and unfoldment of these four rivers of human genealogy, as there has been preserved to us in the Bible but a brief history of the career of one of these branches.</p>  
<p>In the time of Abraham we find an effort being made to restore the image, or Logos, which was continued with Isaac, and brought into external form with Jacob, thus giving us an admirable symbol of the trinity of man's existence: Abraham, the spiritual father; Isaac, the soul or thought body; and Jacob, the physical expression and progenitor of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.</p>  
<p>In him (Jacob) was given a prophetic picture of the present existing conditions in the world. Under the conditions which this prophetic picture foreshadowed, ten-twelfths of the sons of Israel were born under parental conditions, where there was no true spiritual</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_4"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>love existing between the parents; and either through Jacob, or the mothers being instructed so to do, we find that they gave the children names which expressed the true nature of all persons born under similar conditions, from that time to the present. We also learn that these names not only express the nature of children born under those circumstances, but they also express leading characteristics of the persons born in the twelve signs of the zodiac, and that they are given in the exact order of the twelve periods of that zodiac; and we are led to see that they were born under the twelve mental conditions which represent the fulness of the heavens. The student will find abundant proof in this system of the truthfulness of the above statement: thus we see that certain mental conditions are necessary, otherwise a child of a certain quality could not be conceived, and we find a distinct relation or expression of these qualities is registered by the position of the earth and solar system at the period of birth. This fact being thoroughly evinced, we are forced to conclude that the movements of the planets of our system constantly wield a controlling influence upon the life and thought of the people of earth.</p>  
<p>By reading the twenty-ninth chapter of Genesis, beginning at the thirty-second verse, we observe: "And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben (&#x264E;, Libra); for she said, 'Surely the Lord hath looked upon my affliction; now, therefore, my husband will love me.'" (Reuben, <i>who sees the sun</i>, <i>the vision of the sun</i>.) As will be seen, the leading characteristic of Reuben (&#x264E;, Libra) is power of foresight, vision, or intuitive perception.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_5"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the Lord hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also'; and she called his name Simeon" (that is, Simeon or Simon, <i>that hears or obeys, that is heard</i>). This well expresses the leading .characteristic of the sign &#x264F; (Scorpio), which is to hear, or obey authorities; and in their sphere of use as superintendents they demand to be obeyed.</p>  
<p>"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, 'Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have borne him three sons'; therefore was his name called Levi" (<i>who is joined, who is held or associated</i>). The leading characteristic of the &#x2650; (Sagittarius) nature which is herein expressed is fidelity, faithfulness to the marriage vow.</p>  
<p>"And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she said, 'Now will I praise the Lord'; therefore she called his name Judah" (<i>the praise of the Lord</i>). This has a twofold expression,&#151;that of the great business idea embodied in &#x2651; (Capricorn), which was expressed by Solomon in these words: "Men will praise thee when thou doest well to thyself"; and also that deep interior, inexpressible, extravagant ideality, which is a dominant feature of those born in the sign Capricorn.</p>  
<p>"And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister, and said unto Jacob, 'Give me children, or else I die. . . .'</p>  
<p>"And Rachel said, 'God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son': therefore, she called his name Dan" (<i>judgment, or he that judges</i>). This expresses one of the most prominent characteristics of the &#x2652; (Aquarius) nature in the quickness</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_6"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 6</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and accuracy of their intuitions, and in judging of the nature and disposition of people.</p>  
<p>"And Bilhah, Rachel's maid, conceived again and bare Jacob a second son, and Rachel said, 'With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed'; and she called his name Naphtali" (<i>wrestlings of God&#151;my wrestlings</i>). This very well expresses the anxious wrestling nature of those born in the sign &#x2653; (Pisces).</p>  
<p>"And Leah said, 'A troop cometh'; and she called his name Gad" (<i>armed and prepared</i>). Which expresses the uses of the brain &#x2648; (Aries), which keeps the body in harmony, and arms and prepares for all service.</p>  
<p>And Zilpah, Leah's maid, bare Jacob a second son. And Leah said, 'Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed': and she called his name Asher" (<i>blessedness, or happiness</i>). This expresses the leading characteristic of the &#x2649; (Taurus) nature, which is the happy self-satisfied condition of those born in that sign.</p>  
<p>"And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived and bare Jacob the fifth son. And Leah said, 'God hath given me my hire because I have given my maiden unto my husband; and she called his name Issachar" (<i>price, reward, recompense</i>). This expresses the leading characteristics of the sign &#x264A; (Gemini), which are the mental uses and rewards which it always obtains.</p>  
<p>"And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son. And Leah said, 'God hath endowed me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons'; and she called his</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_7"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 7</FONT></A></p>  
<p>name Zebulun" (<i>dwelling, habitation</i>). This expresses the leading characteristic of persons born under the sign of &#x264B; (Cancer), as it relates to their domestic proclivities.</p>  
<p>"And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah, or Diania" (<i>judgment</i>, or <i>who judges; luminous, perfect</i>). This, the seventh child of Leah, was born in the eleventh sign of the zodiac, being the eleventh child born to Jacob. In this sign there is a deep metaphysical principle embodied, in the fact of this child being a female. In the first place, this implies that the sign &#x264C; (Leo), interiorly considered, is a feminine sign; but as it is the seventh child of Leah, seven being the perfect number, as an expresser in internals of the interior perception as hereinafter referred to, that the interior of man is woman, and the intuitive perceptions are from the interior spiritual nature, as referred to by Isaiah xi. 3: "And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears. But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth." Thus justifying the meaning of the name Dinah. But, as the spiritual must have a physical and external through which to express itself, therefore, in place of Dinah, counting in the sign representing the physical character, Joseph, the first child of the beloved wife Rachel, whose birth was accounted the answer to this long-prayed-for event, stood as the physical expression of the gift of God to the world.</p>  
<p>"And she conceived and bare a son, and said, 'God</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_8"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>hath taken away my reproach': and she called his name Joseph" (that is, <i>adding</i>, <i>increase</i>). This has, a double significance. First, as to the physical character of those born in the sign &#x264C; (Leo), which expresses the love nature and prolific sex principle; second, we find evidence throughout the scripture that there is a deep metaphysical reference to this nature or sign as a saviour of the people. We find, Genesis xlix. 22, 24, "Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well . . . (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel)." Again, twenty-fifth verse, "Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breast and of the womb." In chapter xli. 41, we find: "And <A HREF="errata.htm#0">Pharoah</A> said unto Joseph, 'See, I have. set thee over all the land of Egypt.'" Again, in the fifty-seventh verse: "And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn." Chapter xlvii. 12: "And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household with bread, according to their families." Thus, having saved his people, we find Joseph giving assurance to his brethren after the death of Jacob. Genesis 1. 19: "And Joseph said unto them, Fear not, for I am in the place of God.'</p>  
<p>We also find on the part of the prophets a constant reference to the Lion of God, which is generally accepted as referring to Jesus. Isaiah is replete with such reference. In Revelation v. 5 we find: "And one of the elders said unto me, 'Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and loose the seven seals thereof.'"</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_9"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 9</FONT></A></p>  
<p>And now, in regard to the twelfth son of Jacob, we find, Genesis xxxv. 16-18: "And Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor. And it came to pass . . . that the midwife said unto her, 'Fear not, thou shalt have this son also.' And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing (for she died), that she called his name Benoni; but his father called him Benjamin" (<i>son of right hand</i>, or <i>power</i>). This expresses the unparalleled power of those born under the sign &#x264D; (Virgo), in their strong will. The first letter of the great cabalistic name; &#8207;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;&#8206; (Yahveh or Yhvh), usually translated Jehovah, is in itself the symbol of the right hand in the attitude of pointing out the way. Virgo belonging to the digestive function and intuitive faculty, whose office is to take care of its own body by nourishing it, from which source is derived all sustenance and physical strength; therefore power of self-preservation and maintenance are the leading characteristics of the sign Virgo.</p>  
<p>Again, in Genesis xlix., Jacob generalizes the life and character of each of the twelve sons under a prophetic phase of expression. In the third and fourth verses he expresses the excellence and the unreliability of &#x264E; (Libra) owing to its sex proclivities and extreme sensitiveness, and proneness to imitate, true success requiring elements of self-control,&#151;something more than mere imitation.</p>  
<p>The nature of &#x264F; (Scorpio) and &#x2650; (Sagittarius) is expressed from the fifth to the seventh verse,&#151;their hot temper, combativeness, and jealousy.</p>  
<p>The business abilities and luxurious tastes of &#x2651; (Capricorn) are expressed from the eighth to the twelfth verse, showing their power over kingdoms and law-givers,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_10"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 10</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and the function of the business nature in gathering people together in cities.</p>  
<p>The home nature and mercantile proclivities of &#x264B; (Cancer) are expressed in the thirteenth verse. (Here Jacob deviated from the order of the twelve signs, but held close to their character.)</p>  
<p>The anxious, restless nature of &#x264A; (Gemini), and its calling as a server of the intellectuals, is set forth in the fourteenth and fifteenth verses.</p>  
<p>The &#x2652; (Aquarius) nature is expressed from the sixteenth to the eighteenth verse in the treachery and combative tendencies of the trading interests of to-day. Yet behind it all is the desire to do right. Those born in Aquarius are the most difficult to understand, in that they are a paradox in themselves,&#151;merciless, yet ever merciful; kind and sympathetic, yet hard and cold.</p>  
<p>The nineteenth verse expresses the peculiar character of &#x2648; (Aries), the intellectual faculties, which have ever been suppressed in their highest uses by the united physical forces of the world, "but shall overcome at the last," when the intuitions are united with them.</p>  
<p>We can find no better expression of the &#x2649; (Taurus) nature than the words of the twentieth verse: "Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties."</p>  
<p>In the twenty-first verse is expressed the great activity and studious nature of those born under the sign &#x2653; (Pisces).</p>  
<p>From the twenty-second to the twenty-sixth verse inclusive are expressed the wonderful ultimates, that &#x264C; (Leo), being a child of love, is not only capable of, but will attain. This nature is not bound by the walls of conventionality.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_11"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 11</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The twenty-seventh verse expresses the selfishness and self-protective power of &#x264D; (Virgo).</p>  
<p>Moses, who was a master and prophet to the twelve tribes of Israel in the wilderness, before he died repeated another prophecy in Deuteronomy xxxiii. This chapter is wholly an expression of the divine order that will obtain when the prayer that Jesus taught us will have been answered; namely, when the kingdom of God has come on earth.</p>  
<p>The prophet Ezekiel again foresaw the ultimate order of this system, and his whole prophecy is relative thereto, from the first to the last chapter, and will be very plain to all students of this science, especially from chapter xl. to xlviii. inclusive.</p>  
<p>Again, this system is brought to light throughout the book of Revelation, and especially pictured in the description of the holy city in chapter xxi. (See <A HREF="sb04.htm#img_diag07">Diagram No. 7</A>.)</p>  
<p>It is very evident that Jesus, when he came, took up the same line of scientific prophecy, and worked in accordance with the metaphysics of this system, for he chose twelve men as apostles, representatives of the twelve signs of the zodiac, he standing as the central sun, whose spiritual and intellectual light was to flow out through them into the twelve departments of humanity. So important was it considered by the disciples that this order should be kept up, that after Judas betrayed his master they chose Mathias to take his place as one of the twelve.</p>  
<p>Paul, in his letter to the Hebrews, chapter viii. 5, quoted Exodus xxv. 40, and said: "And see that thou make all things according to the pattern showed thee</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_12"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 12</FONT></A></p>  
<p>in the mount," clearly indicating that Moses had a revelation in the mount of the formula of the temple building, which was a pattern of the heavens, but squared by the perfect law of God. (See <A HREF="sb04.htm#img_diag07">Diagram No. 7</A>.)</p>  
<p>The temple in Jerusalem, afterwards built by Solomon, was a hollow square of buildings inside of another hollow square of buildings, and interior to that again was the inner court, or court of the priests, inside of which stood "the house." Each of these had gates facing the four quarters. This was only carrying out in the form of the building what actually was done by the people about the tabernacle in the wilderness (see Numbers ii.), for they camped around it in the order of their use, the minutia of which was given to Moses by God.</p>  
<p>Again, in Revelation xxi., John saw "the holy city, new Jerusalem," and described its pattern according to <A HREF="sb04.htm#img_diag07">Diagram No. 7</A>. We only refer to this, and will not attempt to explain further here. We will leave each person to study and judge of it according to his interest in this line of thought. We may hereafter elaborate this subject in a work on Theosophy.</p>
