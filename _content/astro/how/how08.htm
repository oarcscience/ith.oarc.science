THE UNIVERSAL CONSONANCES OF ALL SIX PLANETS, LIKE COMMON FOUR-PART COUNTERPOINT, CAN EXIST</h3>  
<p>[295] But now, Urania, there is need for louder sound while I climb along the harmonic scale of the celestial movements to higher things where the true archetype of the fabric of the world is kept hidden. Follow after, ye modern musicians, and judge the thing according to your arts, which were unknown to antiquity. Nature, which is never not lavish of herself, after a lying-in of two thousand years, has finally brought you forth in these last generations, the first true images of the universe. By means of your concords of various voices, and through your ears, she has whispered to the human mind, the favorite daughter of God the Creator, how she exists in the innermost bosom.</p>  
<p>(Shall I have committed a crime if I ask the single composers of this generation for some artistic motet instead of this epigraph? The Royal Psalter and the other Holy Books can supply a text suited for this. But alas for you! No more than six are in concord in the heavens. For the moon sings here monody separately, like a dog sitting on the Earth. Compose the melody; I, in order that the book may progress, promise that I will watch carefully over the six parts. To him who more properly expresses the celestial music described in this work, Clio will give a garland, and Urania will betroth Venus his bride.)</p>  
<p>It has been unfolded above what harmonic ratios two neighbouring planets would embrace in their extreme movements. But it happens very rarely that two, especially the slowest, arrive at their extreme intervals at the same time; For example, the apsides of Saturn and Jupiter are about 81&deg; apart. Accordingly, </p>  
<p><A NAME="page_1041"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 1041</FONT></A></p>  
<p>while this distance between them measures out the whole zodiac by definite twenty-year leaps&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, eight hundred years pass by, and nonetheless the leap which concludes the eighth century, does not carry precisely to the very apsides; and if it digresses much further, another eight hundred years must be awaited, that a more fortunate leap than that one may be sought; and the whole route must be repeated as many times as the measure of digression is contained in the length of one leap. Moreover, the other single pairs of planets have periods like that, although not so long. But meanwhile there occur also other consonances of two planets, between movements whereof not both are extremes but one or both are intermediate; and those consonances exist as it were in different tunings [<i>tensionibus</i>]. For, because Saturn tends from <i>G</i> to <i>b</i>, and slightly further, and Jupiter from <i>b</i> to <i>d</i> and further; therefore between Jupiter and Saturn there can exist the following consonances, over and above the octave: the major and minor third and the perfect fourth, either one of the thirds through the tuning which maintains the amplitude of the remaining one, but the perfect fourth through the amplitude of a major whole tone. For there will be a perfect fourth not merely from <i>G</i> of Saturn to <i>cc</i> of Jupiter but also from <i>A</i> of Saturn to <i>dd</i> of Jupiter and through all the intermediates between the <i>G</i> and <i>A</i> of Saturn and the <i>cc</i> and <i>dd</i> of Jupiter. But the octave and the perfect fifth exist solely at the points of the apsides. But Mars, which got a greater interval as its own, received it in order that it should also make an octave with the upper planets through some amplitude of tuning. Mercury received an interval great enough for it to set up almost all the consonances with all the planets within one of its periods, which is not longer than the space of three months. On the other hand, the Earth, and Venus much more so, on account of the smallness of their intervals, limit the consonances, which they form not merely with the others but with one another in especial, to visible fewness. But if three planets are to concord in one harmony, many periodic returns are to be awaited; nevertheless there are many consonances, so that they may so much the more easily take place, while each nearest consonance follows after its neighbour, and very often threefold consonances are seen to exist between Mars, the Earth, and Mercury. But the consonances of four planets now begin to be scattered throughout centuries, and those of five planets throughout thousands of years.</p>  
<p>But that all six should be in concord [296] has been fenced about by the longest intervals of time; and I do not know whether it is absolutely impossible for this to occur twice by precise evolving or whether that points to a certain beginning of time, from which every age of the world has flowed.</p>  
<p>But if only one sextuple harmony can occur, or only one notable one among many, indubitably that could be taken as a sign of the Creation. Therefore we must ask, in exactly how many forms are the movements of all six planets reduced to one common harmony? The method of inquiry is as follows: let us begin with the Earth and Venus, because these two planets do not make more than two consonances and (wherein the cause of this thing is comprehended) by means of very short intensifications of the movements.</p>  
<p>Therefore let us set up two, as it were, skeletal outlines of harmonies, each skeletal outline determined by the two extreme numbers wherewith the limits</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_1042"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 1042</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of the tunings are designated, and let us search out what fits in with them from the variety of movements granted to each planet.</p>  
<p>Harmonies of all the Planets, or Universal Harmonies in the Major Mode</p>

<p>Saturn joins in this universal consonance with its aphelial movement, the Earth with its aphelial, Venus approximately with its aphelial; at highest tuning, Venus joins with its perihelial; at mean tuning, Saturn joins with its perihelial, Jupiter with its aphelial, Mercury with its perihelial. So Saturn can join in with two movements, Mars with two, Mercury with four. But with the rest remaining, the perihelial movement of Saturn and the aphelial of Jupiter are not allowed. But in their place, Mars joins in with perihelial movement.</p>  
<p>The remaining planets join in with single movements, Mars alone with two, and Mercury with four.</p>  
<p>[297] Accordingly, the second skeletal outline will be that wherein the other possible consonance, 5 : 8, exists between the Earth and Venus. Here one eighth of the 94&acute;50&#8243; of the diurnal aphelial movement of Venus or 11&acute;51&#8243; +, if multiplied by 5, equals the 59&acute;16&#8243; of the movement of the Earth; and similar parts of the 97&acute;37&#8243; of the perihelial movement of Venus are equal to the 61&acute;1&#8243; of the movement of the Earth. Accordingly, the other planets are in concord in the following diurnal movements:</p>

<p>Here again, in the mean tuning Saturn joins in with its perihelial movement, Jupiter with its aphelial, Mercury with its perihelial. But at highest tuning approximately the perihelial movement of the Earth joins in.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_1044"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 1044</FONT></A></p>

<p><A HREF="errata.htm#5">And</A> here, with the aphelial movement of Jupiter and the perihelial movement of Saturn removed, the aphelial movement of Mercury is practically admitted besides the perihelial. The rest remain.</p>  
<p>Therefore astronomical experience bears witness that the universal consonances of all the movements can take place, and in the two modes [<i>generum</i>], the major and minor, and in both genera of form, or (if I may say so) in respect to two pitches and in any one of the four cases, with a certain latitude of tuning and also with a certain variety in the particular consonances of Saturn, Mars, and Mercury, of each with the rest; and that is not afforded by the intermediate movements alone, but by all the extreme movements too, except the aphelial movement of Mars and the perihelial movement of Jupiter; because since the former occupies <i>f</i> sharp; and the latter, <i>d</i> Venus, which occupies perpetually the intermediate <i>e</i> flat or <i>e</i>, does not allow those neighbouring dissonances in the universal consonance, as she would do if she had space to go beyond <i>e</i> or <i>e</i> flat. This difficulty is caused by the wedding of the Earth and Venus, or the male and the female. These two planets divide the kinds [<i>genera</i>] of consonances into the major and masculine and the minor and feminine, according as the one spouse has gratified the other&#151;namely, either the Earth is in its aphelion, as if preserving [298] its marital dignity and performing works worthy of a man, with</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_1045"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 1045</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Venus removed and pushed away to her perihelion as to her distaff; or else the Earth has kindly allowed her to ascend into aphelion or the Earth itself has descended into its perihelion towards Venus and as it were, into her embrace, for the sake of pleasure, and has laid aside for a while its shield and arms and all the works befitting a man; for at that time the consonance is minor.</p>  
<p>But if we command this contradictory Venus to keep quiet, <i>i.e.</i>, if we consider what the consonances not of all but merely of the five remaining planets can be, excluding the movement of Venus, the Earth still wanders around its <i>g</i> string and does not ascend a semitone above it. Accordingly <i>b</i>&#9837;, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i><u>&#9837;</u>, and e can be in concord with <i>g</i>, whereupon, as you see, Jupiter, marking the <i>d</i> string with its perihelial movement, is brought in. Accordingly, the difficulty about Mars&#146; aphelial movement remains. For the aphelial movement of the Earth, which occupies <i>g</i>, does not allow it on <i>f</i> sharp; but the perihelial movement, as was said above in Chapter V, is in discord with the aphelial movement of Mars by about half a diesis.</p>

<p>Here at the most grave tuning, Saturn and the Earth join in with their aphelial movements; at the mean tuning, Saturn with its perihelial and Jupiter with its aphelial; at the most acute, Jupiter with its perihelial.</p>

<p>Here the aphelial movement of Jupiter is not allowed, but at the most acute tuning Saturn practically joins in with its perihelial movement.</p>  
<p>But there can also exist the following harmony of the four planets, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury, wherein too the aphelial movement of Mars is present, but it is without latitude of tuning.</p>

<p>Accordingly the movements of the heavens are nothing except a certain everlasting polyphony (intelligible, not audible) with dissonant tunings, like certain syncopations or cadences (wherewith men imitate these natural dissonances), which tends towards fixed and prescribed clauses&#151;the single clauses having six terms (like voices)&#151; and which marks out and distinguishes the immensity of time with those notes. Hence it is no longer a surprise that man, the ape of his Creator, should finally have discovered the art of singing polyphonically [<i>per concentum</i>], which was unknown to the ancients, namely in order that he might play the everlastingness of all created time in some short part of an hour by means of an artistic concord of many voices and that he might to some extent taste the satisfaction of God the Workman with His own works, in that very sweet sense of delight elicited from this music which imitates God.</p>  
<p>NOTE: The comparison Kepler draws between the celestial harmonies and the polyphonic music of his time may be clarified by a simple example for four voices from&#151;Palestrina, <i>O Crux:</i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>As will be observed each of the four voices (as it would also be with the six to which Kepler refers) moves from one consonant chord to another while following a graceful melodic line. Sometimes bits of scales or passing tones are added to give a voice more melodic freedom expressiveness. For the same reason a voice may remain on the same note while the other voices change to a new chord. When this becomes a dissonance (called a syncopation) in the new chord it usually resolves by moving one step downward to a tone that is consonant with the other voices. As in this example each section or "<A HREF="errata.htm#6">clause</A>" ends with a cadence.</p>
