</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">CHAPTER IV</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE QUALITY OF EMPLOYMENT</h3>  
<p>THE dominion of the employment, or profession, is claimed in two quarters; viz. by the Sun, and by the sign on the mid-heaven.</p>  
<p>It is, therefore, necessary to observe whether any planet may be making its oriental appearance nearest to the Sun,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_231"></A><A HREF="#fn_231"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and whether any be posited in the mid-heaven; especially, when also receiving the application of the Moon. And if one and the same planet possess both these qualifications, that is to say, make its nearest appearance to the Sun, and be also in the mid-heaven, that one alone must be elected to determine the present inquiry: and, likewise, though the planet should not be thus doubly qualified, but only singly, in whichever respect, even then that planet alone must still be elected provided itself alone should possess such single qualification. If, however, there should be one planet presenting its nearest appearance, and another in the mid-heaven conciliating the Moon, both must then be noticed; and whichever of two may have greater sway, and possess greater rights of dominion, that one must be preferred. But where not any planet may be found so situated, neither making its appearance as above described, nor being in the mid-heaven, then that one, possessing the dominion of the mid-heaven,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_232"></A><A HREF="#fn_232"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is to be considered as lord of the employment: it is,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_121"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 121</FONT></A></p>  
<p>however, only some occasional occupation which can be thus denoted; because persons, born under such a configuration, most commonly remain at leisure and unemployed.</p>  
<p>What has now been said, relates to the election of the lord of the employment or profession; but the species of the employment will be distinguished by means of the respective properties of the three planets, Mars, Venus, and Mercury, and of the signs in which they may be posited.</p>  
<p>Mercury, for instance, produces writers, superintendents of business, accountants, teachers in the sciences, merchants and bankers: also, soothsayers, astrologers, and attendants on sacrifices, and, in short, all who live by the exercise of literature, and by furnishing explanation or interpretation; as well as by stipend and salary, or allowance. If Saturn bear testimony jointly with Mercury, persons then born will become managers of the affairs of others, or interpreters of dreams, or will be engaged in temples for the purpose of divination, and for the sake of their fanaticism. But, if Jupiter join testimony, they will be painters, orators, or pleaders in argument, and occupied with eminent personages.</p>  
<p>Should Venus have dominion of the employment, she will cause persons to be engaged in the various perfumes of flowers, in unguents and wines, and also in colours, dyes, and in spices: thus she will produce vendors of unguents, garland-makers,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_233"></A><A HREF="#fn_233"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> wine-merchants, dealers in medical drugs, weavers, dealers in spices, painters, dyers, and vendors of apparel. If Saturn add his testimony to hers, he will cause persons to be employed in matters belonging to amusement and decoration; and will also produce jugglers, <A HREF="errata.htm#12">sorcerers</A> and charlatans, and all such as practise similarly. But, if Jupiter join testimony with Venus, persons will become prize-wrestlers, and garland-wearers,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_234"></A><A HREF="#fn_234"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and will be advanced in honour through female interest.</p>  
<p>Mars, ruling the employment, and being configurated with the Sun, will produce persons who operate by means of fire; for instance, cooks, as well as those who work in copper, brass, and other metals, by</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_122"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 122</FONT></A></p>  
<p>melting, burning, and casting: if Mars be separated from the Sun, he will make shipwrights, smiths, agriculturists, stonemasons, carpenters, and subordinate labourers. If Saturn bear testimony, in addition to Mars, persons will <A HREF="errata.htm#13">become</A> mariners, workers in wells, vaults or mines, painters, keepers of beasts or cattle, cooks or butchers, and attendants on baths or on exhibitions. And, if Jupiter join testimony, they will be soldiers, or mechanics, collectors of revenue, inn-keepers, toll-gatherers, or attendants on sacrifices.</p>  
<p>Further, should it happen that two arbiters of employment may be found together, and provided they should be Mercury and Venus, they will then produce musicians, melodists, and persons engaged in music, poetry, and songs: they will also produce (especially if changed in their places)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_235"></A><A HREF="#fn_235"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, mimics, actors, dealers in slaves, makers of musical instruments, choristers and musical performers, dancers, weavers, modellers in wax, and painters. And if Saturn join testimony with Mercury and Venus, the preparation and sale of female ornaments will be added to the aforesaid occupations. But, if Jupiter give testimony, the persons will become administrators of justice, guardians of public affairs, instructors of youth, and magistrates of the people.</p>  
<p>Should Mercury and Mars together be lords of the employment, persons will become statuaries, armour-makers, sculptors,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_236"></A><A HREF="#fn_236"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> modellers of animals, wrestlers, surgeons, spies or informers, adulterers, busy in crime, and forgers. And, if Saturn also bear testimony in addition to Mercury and Mars, he will produce assassins, highwaymen, thieves, robbers lurking in ambush, marauders on cattle, and swindlers. But, if Jupiter afford testimony, he will engage persons in honourable warfare, and in industry; making them cautious and diligent in business, curious in foreign matters, and deriving profit from their pursuits.</p>  
<p>When Venus and Mars exercise the dominion together, persons will become dyers, dealers in unguents and perfumes, workers in tin, lead, gold, and silver, mock combatants or dancers in armour, dealers in medical drugs, agriculturists, and physicians, healing by means of medicine. And if Saturn add testimony to Venus and Mars, he will produce persons attendant on animals consecrated to religion; also grave-diggers and undertakers, mourners and musicians at funerals, and fanatics occupied in religious ceremonies, lamentations, and blood. But, if Jupiter add testimony, the persons will become regulators of sacrifices, augurs, holders of sacred offices, governors placed over women, and interpreters; and they will derive support from such occupations.</p>  
<p>The properties of the signs, in which the lords of the employment may be posited, are also influential in varying the employment. For</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_123"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 123</FONT></A></p>  
<p>example, the signs of human shape promote all scientific pursuits, and such as are of utility to mankind; the quadrupedal signs contribute to produce employment among metals, in business and trade, in house-building, and in the work of smiths and mechanics: the tropical and equinoctial signs tend to give employment in translation or interpretation, in matters of exchange, in mensuration and agriculture, and in religious duties: the terrestrial and watery signs tend to employment in water, and in connection with water, as well in regard to the nurture of plants, as to ship-building; they likewise contribute to employment in funerals, in embalming and preserving, and also in salt.</p>  
<p>Moreover, should the Moon herself actually occupy the place regulating the employment,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_237"></A><A HREF="#fn_237"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and, after her conjunction, continue in course with Mercury, being at the same time in Taurus, Capricorn, or Cancer, she will then produce soothsayers, attendants on sacrifices, and diviners by the basin.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_238"></A><A HREF="#fn_238"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> If she be in Sagittarius or Pisces, she will make necromancers, and evokers of d&aelig;mons: if in Virgo or Scorpio, magicians, astrologers, and oracular persons, possessing prescience: and, if in Libra, Aries, or Leo, she will produce fanatics, interpreters of dreams, and makers of false vows and adjurations.</p>  
<p>From the foregoing rules, the various forms of employment are to be inferred; and its magnitude or importance will be manifested by the existing power of the ruling planets. For instance, if the said planets be oriental, or in angles, they will give the person eminence and authority in his employment; but, if occidental or cadent, they will render him subordinate. And should the benefics be in elevation, the employment will be important, lucrative, secure, honourable, and agreeable; but, on the other hand, if the malefics be in elevation above the lords of the employment, it will then be mean, disreputable, unprofitable, and insecure: thus, Saturn brings an adverse influence in coldness or tardiness, and in the composition or mixture of colours&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_239"></A><A HREF="#fn_239"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; and Mars</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_124"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 124</FONT></A></p>  
<p>produces opposition by audacity and publicity in enterprise: and both planets are alike hostile to proficiency and prosperity.</p>  
<p>The general period, at which any increase or diminution of the employment may take place, must, again in this case also, be determined by the disposition of the stars, which operate the effect towards the oriental and occidental angles.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_231"></A><A HREF="ptb67.htm#fr_231">120:1</A> See the 4th Chapter of the 8th Book of the Almagest inserted in the Appendix.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_232"></A><A HREF="ptb67.htm#fr_232">120:2</A> The Greek says merely "that one having the dominion," without specifying the place of dominion: the Latin printed at Perugio, is, however, "<i>dominum accipe medii c&#339;li</i>," which is certainly the sense required by the tenor of the previous instructions. Whalley also has similarly rendered it.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_233"></A><A HREF="ptb67.htm#fr_233">121:1</A> Among the ancients, a garland was an indispensable decoration at all public ceremonies, whether civil or religious, and at private banquets. The making of garlands was, therefore, a considerable employment.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_234"></A><A HREF="ptb67.htm#fr_234">121:2</A> It would seem, from "garland-wearers" being placed here in connection with "prize-wrestlers" (&#0945;&#0952;&#0955;&#0951;&#0964;&#0945;&#0953;), that the author intended to point out persons competent to obtain the victors' wreath in public exhibitions. But it appears that the word &#0963;&#0949;&#0966;&#0945;&#0957;&#0951;&#0966;&#0959;&#0961;&#0959;&#0962;, <i>garland-wearer</i>, also signifies a person who was annually chosen by the priests to superintend religious ceremonies, an office similar to that of high priest. According to Athen&aelig;us, the Stephanephorus of Tarsos was invested with a purple tunic, edged or striped with white, and wore the laurel chaplet, which Plato, in the treatise <i>de Legibus</i>, describes as being constantly worn by these officers, although the other priests wore it only during the performance of the ceremonies.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_235"></A><A HREF="ptb67.htm#fr_235">122:1</A> Meaning probably "if in mutual reception," which position has been before explained.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_236"></A><A HREF="ptb67.htm#fr_236">122:2</A> Or makers of hieroglyphics--&#0953;&#0949;&#0961;&#0959;&#0947;&#0955;&#0965;&#0966;&#0959;&#0953;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_237"></A><A HREF="ptb67.htm#fr_237">123:1</A> That is to say, the mid-heaven; as stated in the 4th Chapter of the 3rd Book, and in the commencement of the present Chapter.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_238"></A><A HREF="ptb67.htm#fr_238">123:2</A> This mode of divination, as practised by the Greeks, is mentioned by Potter. It is likewise described by a learned Doctor of Medicine, Geo. Pictorius Vigillanus (in his Treatise "de Speciebus Magi&aelig; Ceremonialis," printed at Strasburgh, 1531), as being used "when the fraudulent vanity of a d&aelig;mon renders things more like each other than eggs are to eggs." And, according to this writer, it is practised by exorcising water, and pouring it into a basin, wherein the vain and refractory d&aelig;mon is immersed: the said d&aelig;mon will sometimes remain at the bottom, and sometimes raise himself to the surface, sending forth a slender hissing; out of which the desired responses are to be formed.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_239"></A><A HREF="ptb67.htm#fr_239">123:3</A> &#0922;&#0961;&#0945;&#0963;&#0949;&#0963;&#0953; &#0964;&#0969;&#0957; &#0967;&#0961;&#0969;&#0956;&#0945;&#0964;&#0969;&#0957;.--These words have been rendered literally, but they seem to contain some figurative meaning, rather than a literal one. Perhaps the preferable sense of them is, "<i>by a mixture of views</i>," or "<i>from various pursuits being blended together</i>."</P>
