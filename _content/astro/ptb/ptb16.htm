</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">CHAPTER XIII</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE INFLUENCE OF THE FOUR ANGLES</h3>  
<p>THE angles are the four cardinal points of the horizon, whence are derived the general names of the winds. With respect to their qualities, it is to be observed that the eastern point, or angle of the ascendant,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_22"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 22</FONT></A></p>  
<p>is chiefly dry in its nature; because, on the Sun's arrival therein, the damps occasioned by the night begin to be dried up: and all winds blowing from that quarter, under the common name of east winds, are arid and free from moisture.</p>  
<p>The southern point, or angle of the mid-heaven, is the most hot; because the Sun's <A HREF="errata.htm#3">meridian</A> position, which produces greater warmth and heat, declines (in this part of the earth) towards the south. The winds, therefore, which blow from that quarter, and are commonly called south winds, are hot and rarefying.</p>  
<p>The western point, or occidental angle, is moist; because, when the Sun is there, the moisture, which had been overpowered during the day, recommences its operation: and the winds proceeding from thence, and commonly called west winds, are light and damp.</p>  
<p>The northern point, or angle of the lower heaven, is the most cold; for the Sun's meridian position in this part of the earth is far removed from it in declination: and all winds thence proceeding, under the common name of north winds, are cold and frosty.</p>  
<p>It will, of course, be seen that a thorough acquaintance with the fore-going matters is essential in order to acquire the faculty of distinguishing temperaments in every shape and variation: since it is sufficiently obvious that the effective influence of the stars must be greatly diversified by the constitutions of the seasons, as well as those of the ages of life, and of the angles; and also that the stars have a much stronger influence on any constitution, when there may not be in it any tendency contrary to their own, as the whole influence is then entire and unalloyed For example, stars effecting heat operate more vigorously in constitutions of heat; and those effecting moisture in constitutions of moisture. On the other hand, should a tendency, contrary to their own, exist in any constitution, the stars accordingly become less efficacious; in consequence of being attempered and mixed with that contrary tendency: and this happens, for instance, when stars effecting heat are attempered by constitutions of cold, or stars producing moisture by constitutions of dryness. The influence of every star is thus modified by the proportion-ate admixture presented by constitutions of a nature different from its own.</p>  
<p>In succession to the previous instructions, the following description of the natural and peculiar properties of the signs of the zodiac is annexed: the general temperaments of the signs are analogous to those of the seasons, which are respectively established under each sign, but they have, also, certain peculiar energies, arising from their familiarity with the Sun, the Moon, and the stars, which shall be hereafter specified;--and the simple and unmixed influences existing in the signs, as considered only in themselves and with regard to each other, will be first stated.</p>
