### CHAPTER XVIII

### SIGNS BEHOLDING EACH OTHER, AND OF EQUAL POWER

ANY two signs, equally distant from either tropical sign, are equal to
each other in power; because the Sun, when present in one, makes day and
night, and the divisions of time, respectively equal in duration to
those which he produces when present in the other. Such signs are also
said to behold each other, as well for the foregoing reasons, as because
each of them rises from one and the same part of the horizon, and sets
in one and the same part. <span id="fr_56"></span>[2](#fn_56)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_56"></span>[26:2](ptb21.htm#fr_56) Whalley has a very
lengthy note upon this and the preceding chapter, to show that Ptolemy
here speaks of zodiacal parallels, or parallels of declination, and to
point out the necessity of observing a planet's latitude, in order to
ascertain its true parallels. It is, however, to be recollected, that
the <span id="page_27">p. 27</span> parallels now alluded to are
distinct from the *mundane parallels*, which are equal distances from
the horizon or meridian, and are considered by Ptolemy in the 14th and
15th Chapters of the 3rd Book of this work; although not under the
express name of mundane parallels.
