# BOOK THE FOURTH

### CHAPTER I

### PROEM

ALL those circumstances have now been set forth, which occur previously
to the birth, as well as at the actual birth, and after it, and which it
seemed necessary to mention, as conducing to a knowledge of the general
quality of the contemperament produced. And of the other points, now
remaining, by which extrinsic events <span
id="fr_223"></span>[1](#fn_223) are contemplated, those regarding the
several fortunes of wealth and of rank claim to be taken first into
consideration. Each of these fortunes has a distinct relationship; for
instance, that of wealth relates to the body, and that of rank to the
mind.

### Footnotes

events as are independent of the will, and not necessarily consequent on
any peculiar conformation of the mind or body.
