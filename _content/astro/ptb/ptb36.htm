<p>THE first of the several branches of consideration just enumerated relates to locality, and is to be exercised in the following manner:--</p>  
<p>In all eclipses of the Sun and Moon, and especially in such as are fully visible, the place in the zodiac, where the eclipse happens, is to be noted; and it must be seen what countries are in familiarity with that place, according to the rules laid down regarding the quadrants and the triplicities; and in like manner it must be observed what cities are under the influence of the sign in which the eclipse happens; either by means of the ascendant, and the situations of the luminaries at the time of their foundation, or by means of the mid-heaven of their kings or governors, actually ruling at the time of the eclipse; although such time may be subsequent to the building of the said cities. Whatever countries or cities shall be thus found in familiarity with the ecliptical place, will all be comprehended in the event; which will, however, principally attach to all those parts which may be connected with the identical sign of the eclipse,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_94"></A><A HREF="#fn_94"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and in which it was visible while above the earth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_95"></A><A HREF="#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_94"></A><A HREF="ptb36.htm#fr_94">53:1</A> As shown in the Table at page <A HREF="ptb33.htm#page_51">51</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_95"></A><A HREF="ptb36.htm#fr_95">53:2</A> It does not appear that the text here warrants the conclusion which Whalley has drawn from it, viz. "that wherever eclipses are not visible, they have no influence, and therefore subterranean eclipses cannot have any." Ptolemy declares, that <i>all</i> countries in familiarity with the ecliptical place will be comprehended in the event; and, with regard to the visibility or invisibility of the eclipse, he says merely that its effects will be <i>principally</i> felt in such of the said countries as might have obtained a view of the eclipse.</P>
