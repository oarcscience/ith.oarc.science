</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">CHAPTER V</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE PARENTS</h3>  
<p>UNDER each head of inquiry, the proposed investigation must be entered upon in the manner mentioned in the preceding chapter: and, to proceed in due order, the circumstances relating to the parents require to be first disposed of.</p>  
<p>In conformity with nature, the Sun and Saturn are allotted to the person of the father; and the Moon and Venus to that of the mother: and the mode in which these luminaries and planets may be found posited, with reference to each other, as well as to other planets and stars, will intimate the situation of affairs affecting the parents.</p>  
<p>Thus, for example, the degree of their fortune and wealth will be</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_78"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 78</FONT></A></p>  
<p>indicated by the doryphory,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> or attendants of the luminaries. If the luminaries be accompanied (either in the same signs in which themselves are placed, or in the signs next following), by the benefics, and by such stars or planets as are of the same tendency as themselves, a conspicuous and brilliant fortune is presaged: especially, should the Sun be attended by matutine stars, and the Moon by vespertine,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_130"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and these stars be also well established in the prerogatives before mentioned. Likewise, if Saturn or Venus be matutine, and in proper face,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> or in an angle, it foreshows the prosperity of either parent respectively, according to the scheme.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> If, however, the luminaries hold no connection with the planets, and be unattended by any doryphory, the adverse fortunes of the parents, their humble state and obscurity, and then denoted; especially, if Saturn and Venus may not be favourably constituted. The parents are also subjected to a state of vicissitude, never rising above mediocrity, when the luminaries may have a doryphory of a condition or tendency foreign to their own: as, for instance, when Mars may ascend near in succession to the Sun, or Saturn to the Moon; or if the benefics be found constituted unfavourably, and not in conformity with their own natural condition and tendency. But should the part of fortune, as shown by the scheme of the nativity, be found in a favourable position, and id consonance with the doryphory of the Sun and Moon, the estate of the parents will then remain steady and secure. If, however, the position be discordant and adverse, or if the malefics compose the doryphory, the parents' estate will be unproductive and even burthensome.</p>  
<p>The probable duration of the lives of the parents is to be inferred by means of other configurations. And, in the case of the father, a long life is presaged, if Jupiter, or Venus, be in any mode whatever configurated with either the Sun, or Saturn; or, also, if Saturn himself make an harmonious configuration with the Sun; (that is to say, either by the conjunction, the sextile, or the trine); provided such configuration be fully and strongly established and confirmed:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_133"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and, when not so established and confirmed, although it does not actually denote a short life, yet it will not then equally presage a long life.</p>

<p>If however the planets be not posited in the manner just described and if Mars be elevated above,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_134"></A><A HREF="#fn_134"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> or ascend in succession to the Sun, or to Saturn; or, even, should Saturn himself not be in consonance with the Sun, but configurated with it by the quartile or opposition, and if, when thus circumstanced, both he and the Sun should be posited in cadent houses, it is then indicated that the father is liable to infirmities but, if in angles or succedent houses, the father will live only a short life, and suffer from various bodily injuries and diseases. The shortness of his life is particularly intimated by the position of the Sun and Saturn in the first two angles, viz. the ascendant and the mid-heaven, or in their succedent houses; and his affliction by diseases and injuries, when they may be posited in the two other angles, the western and the lower heaven, or in the houses succedent thereto. And, if Mars be aspected to the Sun in the way before-mentioned, the father will die suddenly, or receive injury in his face or eyes; but, should Mars be so aspected to Saturn, he will be afflicted with contractions of the muscles or limbs, and with fevers and disorders proceeding from inflammation and wounds or even death may be the consequence. And even Saturn himself, if badly configurated with the Sun, will also inflict disease and death on the father, by inducing such particular disorders as are incidental from watery humour.</p>  
<p>The foregoing observations are applicable to the father, and those which follow must be attended to in the case of the mother.</p>  
<p>Should the Sun be configurated, in any mode whatever, with the Moon or Venus, or, should Venus herself be harmoniously configurated with the Moon, either by the sextile, the trine, or the conjunction, the mother will live long.</p>  
<p>If, however, Mars be succedent to the Moon and Venus, or in quartile or opposition to them, or, if Saturn be similarly aspected to the Moon only, and both of them be void of course or retrograde, or cadent,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_80"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 80</FONT></A></p>  
<p>adverse accidents and disease will attend the mother; should they, on the other hand, be swift in motion and placed in angles, they portend that her life will be short, or grievously afflicted. Their position in the oriental angles, or succedent houses, particularly denotes the shortness of her life; and, in those which are occidental, her affliction. In the same manner, should Mars be thus aspected to the Moon (and should that luminary at the same time be oriental), the mother's sudden death, or some injury in her face or eyes, will be produced: and, if the Moon be then occidental, death will be occasioned by miscarriage in parturition, by inflammation, or by wounds. Such are the effects which ensue from these aspects made by Mars to the Moon; but, should he make them to Venus, death will then take place from fever, some latent disease, or sudden sickness. Saturn's aspect&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_135"></A><A HREF="#fn_135"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, to the Moon, when she is oriental, inflicts on the mother disease and death from extreme colds, or fevers; but, should the Moon be occidental, the danger arises from affections of the womb, or from consumption.</p>  
<p>In the investigation of all these circumstances, it is highly essential that the properties of the signs, in which are situated the stars actuating the influence, should be also taken into consideration; and that, by day, the Sun and Venus should be principally observed; and by night, Saturn and the Moon.</p>  
<p>If, however, after due attention has been paid to the foregoing points, a more specific inquiry still, be demanded, it will then become necessary to assume the place allotted to the naternal or maternal condition, as the case may be, for an horoscope or ascendant, in order to pursue the investigation.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_136"></A><A HREF="#fn_136"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> And by this means, which in this respect will answer the purpose of a nativity, all other particulars concerning the parents may be viewed succinctly; according to the general forms hereinafter given, as adapted for practice and applicable to all events.</p>  
<p>In these and in all other cases, the mode, in which the influences are commixed, must be carefully kept in view; and it must be observed whether any particular stars possess, in themselves alone, the operative cause, or whether others share dominion with them; and it is then to be seen which among them all are more powerful, and which of them take the lead in establishing the event: so that due inference may be</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_81"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 81</FONT></A></p>  
<p>drawn agreeably to their several natures. And should the several stars, which may happen to be combined in dominion, be also equal in power, the diversity of their several natures, and the admixture of qualities thence arising, must then be taken into consideration; and, by fairly weighing this various admixture, the nature and quality of the future event may be apprehended.</p>  
<p>Stars, posited separately or at a distance from each other, distribute, at their appropriate times and periods, the events operated by each: thus the earlier events are brought about by stars which are more oriental than others, and the latter events by those which are more occidental. For it is indispensably requisite that the star, under the influence of which some particular event is expected to happen, should be originally&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> connected with the place to which the inquiry, concerning that event, is allotted; and, if such connection should not have existed, no effect of any importance an possibly be produced; because a star does not exercise a vigorous influence, unless it was fully in communication at the beginning. But, however, the time, at which the effect will take place, is further regulated by the relative distance of the star, governing the effect, from the Sun and the angles of the world, as well as by its primary position of dominion.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_130"></A><A HREF="ptb49.htm#fr_130">78:2</A> Or, in other words, "should the stars, which attend the Sun, be such as rise <i>before him</i>; and those, which attend the Moon, such as rise <i>after</i> her."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_131"></A><A HREF="ptb49.htm#fr_131">78:3</A> As described in Chap. XXVI, Book I.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_132"></A><A HREF="ptb49.htm#fr_132">78:4</A> Saturn being applicable to the father, and Venus to the mother.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_133"></A><A HREF="ptb49.htm#fr_133">78:5</A> The Perugio Latin translation, of 1646, inserts here, "and provided Saturn and the Sun are not impeded by being posited in unfortunate or unsuitable places."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_134"></A><A HREF="ptb49.htm#fr_134">79:1</A> "<i>Elevated</i>." Moxon's Mathematical Dictionary gives the following definition of this astrological term. "<i>Elevated</i>. A certain pre-eminence of one planet above another; or, a concurrence of two to a certain act, wherein one being stronger, is carried above the weaker, and does alter and depress its nature and influence: But wherein this being <i>elevated</i> consists, there are several opinions; some say when a planet is nearest the zenith, or meridian; others will have it only that planet is highest; or nearest to the Apog&aelig;on of his eccentric or epicycle. And Argol admits of all these, and several other advantages, and thence advises to collect the several testimonies, and that that planet, who has most, shall be said to be elevated above the other." According to Whalley, Cardan's opinion was that "that planet is most elevated which is more occidental and ponderous." For myself, I conceive this opinion to be inaccurate, because, if Ptolemy meant to signify only the greater occidentality of the planet, he would (as in other instances) have used the word "<i>preceding</i>" instead of "<i>elevated above</i>"; and I incline to think, that <i>greater proximity</i> to the zenith is the truer, as well as more simple, meaning of the term "elevated."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_135"></A><A HREF="ptb49.htm#fr_135">80:1</A> By the quartile or opposition, as before mentioned.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_136"></A><A HREF="ptb49.htm#fr_136">80:2</A> On this passage, Whalley remarks that "Ptolemy teacheth, from the child's nativity, to erect schemes for the father and mother, and thence to give judgment, as if it were their proper nativities; the rule is this: If the nativity be diurnal, for the father, observe the degree the Sun is in, in the child's nativity; and make that the degree ascending for the father; and conformable to that, order the cusps of all the other houses. If for the mother, use Venus. But if the nativity be nocturnal, for the father, take the place of Saturn; and for the mother, that of the Moon." Whalley adds, that what in this chapter hath relation to the parents, is what shall happen to them <i>after</i> the nativity, and not <i>before</i>."</P>
