### CHAPTER VI

### MASCULINE AND FEMININE

THERE are two primary sexes, male and female; and the female sex
partakes chiefly of moisture. The Moon and Venus are therefore said to
be feminine, since their qualities are principally moist.

The Sun, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars are called masculine. Mercury is

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

common to both genders, because at certain times he produces dryness,
and at others moisture, and performs each in an equal ratio.

The stars, however, are also said to be masculine and feminine, by their
positions with regard to the Sun. While they are matutine and preceding
the Sun, they are masculine; when vespertine and following the Sun, they
become feminine <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40).

And they are further regulated in this respect by their positions with
regard to the horizon. From the ascendant to the mid-heaven, or from the
angle of the west to the lower heaven, they are considered to be
masculine, being then oriental: and in the other two quadrants,
feminine, being then occidental.
