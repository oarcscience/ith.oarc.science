### CHAPTER XXIII

### THE DISPOSITION OF THE TERMS <span id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65)

THERE are two methods of disposing the terms of the planets, in
reference to the dominion of the triplicities; one is Ægyptian, the
other Chaldaic.

But the Ægyptian method preserves no regular distribution, neither in
point of successive order nor in point of quantity.

In point of order it is defective, since it, in some instances, allots
the first degrees of a sign to the lord of the house, in others to the
lord of the triplicity, and in others again to the lord of the
exaltation. By selecting examples this failure in order will easily be
seen; for instance, if the order were regulated by the government of
houses, for what reason should Saturn take the first degrees in Libra,
since that sign is the house of Venus? or why should Jupiter take them
in Aries, which is the house of Mars? If the government of triplicities
were followed, for what reason should Mercury take the first degrees in
Capricorn, which is in the triplicity ruled by Venus? If the government
by exaltations, why should Mars take the first degrees in Cancer? that
sign being the exaltation of Jupiter. And if the order were regulated
even by considering the planet which possesses most of these dignities
in the sign, for what reason should Mercury take the first degrees in
Aquarius, in which sign he rules only by triplicity, and why not Saturn,
who has government in it by house, as well as by triplicity? or why in
short should Mercury, who does not possess any kind of dominion in
Capricorn, receive the first degrees in that sign also? The same want of
order is abundantly evident in the rest of the distribution.

An equal irregularity exists in the respective quantities of degrees
allotted by the Ægyptians to the several terms of the planets. For it is
by no means a proper nor sufficient demonstration of accuracy that the
aggregate sum of all the numbers of every single planet amounts to the
precise total requiring to be divided into portions of time; <span
id="fr_66"></span>[2](#fn_66) since, even if it be admitted that this
total, collected from every single star, is correctly asserted by the
Ægyptians, it may still be objected that the same total, so collected by
them, may be found in many other ways by

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

interchanging the numbers in a sign. There are persons also who contend
that in every latitude the same space of time is occupied in ascension
by every star; this, however, is manifestly wrong: for, in the first
place, these persons are guided by the vulgar opinion of the plane
heights of ascension, which is totally foreign to truth, and according
to which, in the parallel of Lower Ægypt, the signs of Virgo and Libra
would ascend each in thirty-eight degrees and a third, <span
id="fr_67"></span>[1](#fn_67) and Leo and Scorpio each in thirty-five
degrees; when it is, on the contrary, shown by the Tables, <span
id="fr_68"></span>[2](#fn_68) that the latter two signs occupy in their
several ascensions more than thirty-five degrees each, but Virgo and
Libra less. It should further be observed, that those who support this
opinion seem (by so doing) not only to dispute the quantity of the terms
most generally received, but to be driven also to the necessity of
falsifying many points; since (as it is indispensable to keep to the
same total amount of all the terms together) they make use of parts of
degrees; but even that contrivance does not enable them to reach the
true point.

The old terms, admitted by many persons on the authority of former
tradition, are as follows:

Thus, by the Ægyptian distribution, it appears that the total numbers of
the degrees for each planet, added together, make 360:--viz. for Saturn
57, Jupiter 79, Mars 66, Venus 82, and Mercury 76.

The method of the Chaldæans contains a certain simplicity of arrangement
as to quantity, and preserves an order of succession rather more
comformable to the dominion of the triplicities. It is, nevertheless,
highly imperfect, as may be easily discovered even without being pointed
out: for in the first triplicity. (which the Chaldæans also attribute to
the same signs; viz. Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius), Jupiter, the lord of
the triplicity, takes the first degrees; Venus, who rules the next
triplicity, follows him; after her, in succession, are Saturn and
Mercury, the lords of the triplicity of Gemini; and lastly Mars, lord of
the remaining triplicity. In the second triplicity (also allotted to the
same signs, viz. Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn), Venus stands first; next
to her, Saturn and Mercury; after them Mars, and Jupiter last. In the
other two triplicities a similar order of succession is closely
followed; and with respect to the third triplicity, which is ascribed to
two lords, viz. to Saturn and Mercury, Saturn is placed first in order
by day and Mercury by night.

The quantity of degrees allotted to each planet is also simply regulated
in the Chaldaic method; it diminishes in graduation from the quantity
given to the planet first in order, so that each successive planet takes
one degree less than that which preceded it. Thus the first planet takes
eight degrees, the second seven, the third six, the fourth five, and the
fifth four. By this arrangement the degrees of Saturn amount by day to
78, and by night to 66; the degrees of Jupiter to 72, of Mars to 69, of
Venus to 75, and of Mercury by day to 66, and by night to 78--the whole
amounting to 360.

Of these two distributions of the terms, that of the Ægyptians seems
more to be relied on than the other; since it has been handed down and
recommended in the writings of the Ægyptian authors, and also because
the degrees of the terms, in nativities rectified by them as examples,
are universally in accordance with this distribution while, on the other
hand, neither the order nor the number of the Chaldaic method has ever
been recorded or explained by any writer--not even by the writers of
that very nation: the accuracy of that method is consequently doubtful,
and its irregularity as to the order of placing the planets is widely
open to censure.

There is, however, an ancient writing which has fallen into the author's
possession, and which gives a rational and consistent account of the
nature of the terms; of the order in which they are to be taken, and of
the quantity belonging to each. It will be found in the subsequent
chapter.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_65"></span>[32:1](ptb26.htm#fr_65) In reference to the
terms of the planets, Placidus has these words (according to Cooper's
translation): "The dignity of the planets in the signs and their parts,
which are called the bounds and terminations" (*quasi*, terms), "have a
real and natural foundation; to wit, the powerful aspect or proportional
influxes to the movable points in which the stars begin to produce the
primary qualities. So that, according to those things we have explained
in the philosophy of the heavens, these are found to agree so well with
the Ægyptian boundaries" (terms), "that they are highly deserving of
admiration."

<span id="fn_66"></span>[32:2](ptb26.htm#fr_66) This total is the 360
degrees of the zodiac, requiring to be divided according to
correspondent portions of the equator; by which all time is reckoned.

<span id="fn_67"></span>[33:1](ptb26.htm#fr_67) The degrees here
mentioned are degrees of the equator.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[33:2](ptb26.htm#fr_68) See, in the Appendix, an
extract from these tables; the whole of which are to be found in the
Almagest.
