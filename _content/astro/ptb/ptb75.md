### ALMAGEST; BOOK II. EXTRACT FROM CHAP. IX

*Of Circumstances regulated by Ascensions*

IN any climate whatever, the magnitude of a given day or night is to be
computed by the number of ascensional times proper to that particular
climate. For example, the magnitude of the day will be ascertained by
numbering the times between the Sun's zodiacal degree and the degree
diametrically opposite, in the succession of the signs; and

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

that of the night, by numbering the times, from the degree diametrically
opposite to the Sun, onwards, in the order of the signs, to be degree
actually occupied by the Sun: because, by dividing the respective
amounts of these times so obtained, by fifteen, the number of equatorial
hours belonging to each space will be exhibited; and if the division be
made by twelve, instead of fifteen, the result will show the numbers of
degrees equivalent to one temporal hour of either of the said spaces
respectively. <span id="fr_296"></span>[1](#fn_296)

The magnitude of any temporal hour may be, however, more easily found by
referring to the annexed Table of Ascensions, and taking the difference
between the respective aggregate numbers, inserted therein under the
heads of the equinoctial parallel or right sphere, and of any particular
climate for which the magnitude of the temporal hour is required; and,
if the said hour be a diurnal hour, the aggregate times as stated
against the zodiacal degree occupied by the Sun; but, if nocturnal,
those stated against the degree diametrically opposite, are to be
compared; and the sixth part of the difference between them is to be
added, if the said degree be in the northern signs, to the fifteen times
of an equatorial hour; but subtracted therefrom, if in the southern
signs. The amount thus obtained will be the required number of degrees
of the temporal hour in question. <span id="fr_297"></span>[2](#fn_297)

And if it be required to reduce the temporal hours of any given day or
night, in a certain climate, into equatorial hours, they must be
multiplied by their proper horary times, whether diurnal or nocturnal,

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

as the case may be; the product is then to be divided by fifteen, and
the quotient will necessarily be the number of equatorial hours in the
climate in question, on the given day or night. <span
id="fr_298"></span>[1](#fn_298) On the other hand, equatorial hours are
also to be reduced into temporal hours by being multiplied by fifteen,
the product of which is to be divided by the horary times proper to the
given day or night in the said climate.

The degree ascending in the ecliptic, at any given temporal hour, may
also be ascertained by multiplying the number of temporal hours since
sunrise, if the given hour be diurnal, but if nocturnal, since sunset,
by their proper horary times; and the product is to be added, in the
succession of the signs, to the aggregate number (as shown by the
ascensions proper to the climate) of the Sun's degree, if the given hour
be diurnal, but, if nocturnal, to that of the degree diametrically
opposite, and that particular degree of the ecliptic which shall
correspond with the total number thus found in the ascensions of the
climate will be the degree then ascending. <span
id="fr_299"></span>[2](#fn_299)

But, in order to ascertain the degree on the meridian above the earth,
the number of temporal hours since the preceding noon are also to be
multiplied by their proper horary times, and the product is to be added
to the aggregate number of the Sun's right ascension; and that degree of
the ecliptic, with which the total number as found in the aggregate

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

times of right ascension shall correspond, will then be on the
meridian. <span id="fr_300"></span>[1](#fn_300) The degree on the
oriental horizon will, however, also show what degrees occupies the
meridian; for, by subtracting 90 times (the amount of the quadrant) from
the aggregate number ascribed to the said ascending degree in the Table
proper to the climate, the number so reduced will be found, in the
aggregate times of the Table of Right Ascension, to correspond with the
degree on the meridian. And again, on the other hand, by adding 90 to
the aggregate times ascribed by right of ascension to the degree on the
meridian above the earth, the degree ascending may be obtained, for it
will be that degree which corresponds to that total number, as stated in
the Table proper to the climate. <span id="fr_301"></span>[2](#fn_301)

The Sun always preserves an equal distance in equatorial hours from all
parts of the same meridian; but his distance in equatorial hours from
different meridians varies according to the degrees of distance between
meridian and meridian.

The foregoing extracts have been made to show the entire agreement
between the astronomy of the Tetrabiblos and that of the Almagest. The
Tables herein given from the latter work are, of course, now, in some
degree, superseded by others of modern calculation, infinitely more
complete.

<span id="fn_296"></span>[148:1](ptb75.htm#fr_296) Thus (according to
the Table inserted at [p. 152](#page_152)), in the climate or latitude
of Lower Ægypt, the times of ascension between the first point of Gemini
and the first point of Sagittarius, diametrically opposite, are 205°
18', which, being divided by 15, give 13 hours 41 minutes and a fraction
of equatorial time, as the length of the day of the first point of
Gemini. And the same number of times of ascension, divided by 12, give
17° 6' and a fraction of the equator, as the length of the diurnal
temporal hour. In the latitude of Southern Britain, the times of
ascension between the same points as above mentioned are 236° 2', which,
divided by 15, give 15 hours 44 minutes and a fraction of equatorial
time, as the length of the day of the first point of Gemini; and, if
divided by 12, they produce 19° 40' and a fraction of the equator, as
the length of the diurnal temporal hour.

<span id="fn_297"></span>[148:2](ptb75.htm#fr_297) Thus, the aggregate
times of ascension, in a right sphere, of the first point of Gemini are
S7° 44'; and, in the climate of Lower Ægypt, 45° 5': the sixth part of
the difference between them is 2° 6' and a fraction, which, added to
15°, again makes the diurnal temporal hour of the first point of Gemini
equal to 17° 6' and a fraction of the equator. In the climate of
Southern Britain, the aggregate times of ascension of the first point of
Gemini are 29° 43': the sixth part of the difference between that sum
and 57° 44' of right ascension is 4° 40' and a fraction, which, added to
15°, makes the diurnal temporal hour of the first point of Gemini, in
South Britain, equal to 19° 40' and a fraction of the equator, as before
shown.

<span id="fn_299"></span>[149:2](ptb75.htm#fr_299) Let the first point
of Gemini be on the meridian above the earth; the number of temporal
hours since sunrise will then be 6, by which 17° 6' 30" are to
multiplied. The product will be 102° 39': this, added to 45° 5', the
aggregate number of the first point of Gemini in the latitude of
Alexandria, will give 147° 44', which, in the ascensions of the climate
in question, will correspond to the 3d degree of Virgo, and show that to
be the degree ascending. In the latitude of Southern Britain the total
number would still amount to the same, viz. 147° 44', but it would show
7° and about 30' of Virgo to be ascending.

<span id="fn_300"></span>[150:1](ptb75.htm#fr_300) Let the first point
of Gemini be three temporal hours past the meridian; these hours reduced
to degrees, in the latitude of Alexandria, will give 51° 19', which,
added to the right ascension of the first point of Gemini, make 109° 3',
showing the 18th degree of Cancer on the meridian. In the latitude of
Southern Britain, these hours would produce 59°, which, added to the
right ascension, would make 116° 44', and show the 25th degree of Cancer
on the meridian.

<span id="fn_301"></span>[150:2](ptb75.htm#fr_301) Thus, in the latitude
of Alexandria, when the first point of Gemini is three temporal hours
past the meridian, the 16th degree of Libra will be on the ascendant,
and the aggregate times of ascension of that degree in the said latitude
are 109° 3': by subtracting 90 from this sum, the remainder will be 19°
3', the right ascension of the mid-heaven answering to the 18th degree
of Cancer. In the latitude of Southern Britain, the 18th degree of Libra
would be on the ascendant, of which degree the aggregate times of
ascension in that latitude are 206° 44', from which, if 90 be
subtracted, the remainder will be 116° 44', the right ascension of the
mid-heaven answering to the 25th degree of Cancer. The converse of these
operations seems too obvious to need explanation.
