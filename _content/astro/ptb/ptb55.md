### CHAPTER XI

### THE DURATION OF LIFE

OF all events whatsoever, which take place after birth, the most
essential is the continuance of life: and as it is, of course, useless
to consider, in cases wherein the life of a child does not extend to the
period of one year, what other events contingent on its birth might
otherwise have subsequently happened, the inquiry into the duration of
life consequently takes precedence of all other questions, as to the
events subsequent to the birth.

The discussion of this inquiry is by no means simple, nor easy of
execution; it is conducted in a diversified process, by means of the
governance of the ruling places. And the method now about to be laid
down seems, of all others, the most consonant with reason, and with
nature: because the influence of the prorogatory places, as well as of
the rulers of those places, and the disposal of the anæretic <span

operation of regulating the duration of life. Each of these influences
is to be distinguished in the mode pointed out in the chapters
immediately ensuing.

is a term of art, adopted from the Greek, signifying fatal, or
destructive.
