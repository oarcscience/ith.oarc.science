<p align="center"><i>Of a Voyage, and its Issue.</i></p>  
<p>If there be good planets in the 9th, or its cusp be well aspected, or the lord of the ascendant or 10th be there, and well affected, it is good. But if &#9797;, &#9796;, &#9794;, or &#9739; be there, It is always evil. If the lord of the 9th be with an evil planet, he shall not speed well. &#9796; shews losses and sickness; &#9794; shews danger by thieves or pirates: and &#9739; much the same as &#9794;, but more of cozening and cheating. The house of substance from the 9th is the 10th. Fortunes there shew wealth; infortunes loss. If benefits be in the 9th, a good voyage; if malefics, many hardships, &amp;c.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>What Wind and Weather the Querent will experience</i>.</p>  
<p>The lord of the ascendant with good planets, and they strong and in friendly aspect, and the lords of the 1st and 9th in &#9651; out of &#9802;, &#9806;, or &#9810;, shew fair weather and favourable winds. The significators in &#9741;, out of fixed signs, shew</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_255"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 255</FONT></A></p>  
<p>detention by foul winds; and if near violent fixed stars; storms and contrary winds will drive him back.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>Of a long Journey, and its Issue</i>.</p>  
<p>If a fortune be in the ascendant, say he will have good success before he sets out, or in the commencement of his journey; if it be in the 10th, then he will have success on the journey; if in the 7th, at the place to which he goes; and if in the 4th, it will be on his return, and when he is come home. In this case &#9795; gives benefits by clerical persons, judges, magistrates, or gentlemen, according to the querent's situation in life and the house &#9795; rules, and the nature of the ruler of &#9795;. As if it be &#9737;, by a king, or nobleman, or person in power; if &#9796;, it will be by old people, or ancient matters, or farmers. &amp;c. Let him apply to such a person in his affairs as &#9796; describes, according to the sign he is in and the aspects he receives. If it be &#9792;, it will be by women, pleasure, sport, &amp;c.; or by dealing in linen, silks, jewels, spices, &amp;c. If &#9791;, by writing or merchandize, letters of introduction, &amp;c. If &#9789;, by some female, probably a widow, or by a sailor, or by carrying news, &amp;c., or by play.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>Of the Length of the Journey, &amp;c</i>.</p>  
<p>The lord of the 9th, or planet therein, or &#9789; in moveable signs, swift and oriental, shew a short time absent. If they be in fixed signs, slow and occidental, it shews a long and tedious journey and absence. If they be in common signs, they shew change of mind, and a varying of his journey, going to other places, &amp;c. According as the &#9789; is assisted or afflicted, judge results to happen. As, for example, if &#9789; be in the 6th, or in &#9741; to its lord, it shews sickness or impediments from servants. The lord of the 4th, and the 4th house, denote the final issue.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_256"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 256</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center"><i>Of the Return, &amp;c ., of a Person who is gone a long Journey</i></p>  
<p>The lord of the ascendant in the ascendant or midheaven, or aspected by planets therein, shows that he is thinking of returning. But if he be in the 7th or 4th, his return is prolonged; and he is not thinking of leaving the place he went to. The lord of the ascendant in the 3d or 9th, applying to a planet in the ascendant, he is on his journey homeward. The same may be judged if he be in the 8th or 2d, and apply to a planet in the 10th; but in this case observe also the &#9789;, and whether she aspect the ascendant, or a planet therein. If the lord of the ascendant or &#9789; apply to a retrograde planet, or the lord of the ascendant be himself a retrograde, and behold the ascendant, he is coming; but if his significator be afflicted, it shews some hinderance which makes him tarry. The dispositor of the &#9789; afflicted, shews hinderance also.</p>  
<p>If you find &#9791; or the &#9789; in the ascendant or midheaven, judge that letters or some news shall come shortly from the party; for &#9791; is the significator of letters, and the &#9789; of news. If they separate from a fortune, it denotes good news; and if from an infortune, the contrary.</p>  
<p>The planet from whom the lord of the ascendant of the quesited is separated, is the significator of the state and condition in which he lately was; the planet to whom he applies, of the state in which he now is; and the planet to whom he afterwards applies is the significator of him to whom he in tends to come.</p>  
<p>If the quesited's significator be going out of one sign into another, judge that he went out of the place he was in, and entered another, or that he has undertaken another journey. Observe in which of those signs he was stronger, better aspected and received, &amp;c.; and so judge of his corresponding condition.</p>  
<p>Observe, that combustion in all questions of one absent,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_257"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 257</FONT></A></p>  
<p>shews some great evil; such as imprisonment, &amp;c.; and if it be in the house of death, or &#9737; be lord of the house of death, it generally denotes death.</p>  
<p>Ever consider for whom the question is asked, and take his proper significator. The lord of the 7th for a husband (or for any one who is no relation), the lord of the 3d a brother, 5th a son, &amp;c.; and note how the fortunes are placed; if strong in the figure, well aspecting the significator of the quesited, or in his house, judge health and prosperity; and the reverse by infortunes.</p>  
<p align="center">OF PROFIT BY, OR PROFICIENCY IN, ANY SCIENCE, &amp;c.</p>  
<p>The ascendant, its lord, and the &#9789;, are for the querent; and the 9th, its lord, or planet therein (if more than one, the nearest to the cusp), for the science.</p>  
<p>See whether the lord of the 9th be fortunate or not, oriental, angular, &amp;c.; and whether he behold the lord of the ascendant with &#10038; or &#9651;. If he be a fortune, and aspect the lord of the ascendant, the man has scientific knowledge, and will gain thereby; the more so if there be reception. If the aspect be &#9744; or &#9741;, the man has talent, but shall do no good by it. If an infortune aspect either the lord of the ascendant or 9th, the man has wearied himself, but to no purpose, for he will never attain the knowledge he desires. If infortunes be in the 9th, or its lord afflicted, the party has but little scientific knowledge.</p>  
<p>The &#9789; must also be observed with the lord of the 9th; for if they both apply to fortunes, the man is scientific; if to infortunes, the contrary.</p>  
<p>If the question be put regarding another person, you must in this case give the ascendant for the quesited.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_118"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>

<p><A NAME="page_258"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 258</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center">EXAMPLE.</p>  
<p>The author having given no good example regarding this question, the reader is here presented with a figure, which will no doubt prove interesting.</p>  
<p>The editor being in company with two other artists, a general desire was expressed to know the future destiny of astrology, and the following figure was erected.</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig24"></A>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
<A HREF="img/fig24.jpg"><IMG SRC="tn/fig24.jpg" ALT="<i>Fig</i>. 24."><BR><FONT SIZE=-3>Click to enlarge</A><BR><i>Fig</i>. 24.</FONT><BR></P></p>  
<p align="center">JUDGMENT ON THE ABOVE FIGURE.</p>  
<p>The first thing to be observed in this figure is that &#9791;, the natural significator of science, is lord of the 9th, and is, therefore,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_259"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 259</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the significator of the science of astrology. He is found cadent, and almost peregrine, having no essential dignity but his term, by which may be seen the present enfeebled state of the science; but as &#9791; has passed through four degrees of his term in a <i>fixed</i> sign, this points out, that for four years it has been in some measure more in credit than previously. And this is the case, as it is about four years since the Editor's publications began to call attention to the science. And as &#9791; has just passed a &#10038; of &#9795;, who describes the person asking the question, it is shewn that the science has been much benefited by such a person, about nine months before, because &#9791; is past the &#10038; of &#9795; by 43', which shews about nine months, taking a degree for a year. And the fact is, that the <i>Grammar of Astrology</i> was published about nine months before the time of the question.</p>  
<p>The &#9739; in the ascendant shews the difficulties the Editor has had to encounter, and the contumely he has had to meet in bringing the science forward again.</p>  
<p>The presence of &#9795; in the 9th, denotes the discredit in which the science is generally held; and being in &#9740; with &#9792;, it shews that injury has been done to it by elderly females, who pretend to practise divining, &amp;c., but who are held in great contempt by the public, as may be seen by the &#9789; (the general significator of the public) being in &#9741; to both &#9792; and &#9796;, from the house of enemies to the science.</p>  
<p>The next aspect formed by &#9791;, is the &#10038; of &#9794;, who being lord of the 11th house of the figure, and placed on the cusp of the 11th from the ninth, denotes <i>friends</i>. This shews, that in about four years from the time of the question, the science will gain many friends among persons denoted by &#9794; in &#9802;, such as writers of public spirit, booksellers, &amp;c.; and there is no doubt that about that time it will suddenly and rapidly gain ground in public opinion. The next aspect</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_260"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 260</FONT></A></p>  
<p>formed by &#9791;, is the &#9741; of &#9797;, from which he is distant 14&deg;; this may shew that some <i>sudden</i> mischief may be done to the interests of the science by means of female agents, as &#9792; is in exact sesquiquadrate aspect to &#9797;. But as &#9797; is retrograde, and not angular, this will not be very important. The &#9737; is in the 12th from the 9th, and denotes secret enmity to the science by men in power, the &#9737; being in &#9804;; and as he disposes of &#9791;, it shews that the hand of power at present keeps it down. As &#9791; is 18&deg; from &#9737;, 1 judge that, about the year 1852, some important honour will be done to the science; probably by the present penal laws being repealed, which forbid the acceptance of any remuneration for practising it. As &#9791; has 20&deg; to pass before he reaches his own dignities, and as &#9796; will then have entered &#9802;, and be disposed of by &#9791;, I judge that about 20 years hence the science will be publicly honoured; and as has afterwards 18&deg; to pass in a common sign (signifying months), I conceive that about 18 months after that, when &#9791; crosses the cusp of the 9th house in this figure (about the year 1856), the science will rapidly rise in public estimation, and be publicly studied in colleges, &amp;c.</p>  
<p>The &#9737; enters &#9805; after two years, as he is two degrees off, which will cause the ruling powers to relax something of their severity against the science; and as he then has 18&deg;, (equal to 18 months, being in a common sign,) to go before he passes the cusp, there will be some person of rank who will assist the science at that time; viz. three years and a half from the time of the question, or the year 1838.</p>  
<p>The &#9789; must now be considered; she is hastening to &#9741; of two planets in the 9th, which shews that there is yet much opposition to be expected to the science by the public, and especially by rash and violent people, which &#9789; in the house of &#9794; always denotes. But after the influence of the &#9741; of &#9796;</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_261"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 261</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and &#9792; is passed away, the &#9789; meets nothing out favourable aspects. It is very remarkable that the &#9789; is aspected by every one of the planets before she passes through &#9800;. The first aspect she forms after &#9741; of &#9796; and &#9792; is &#10038; of &#9795;, which denotes popularity for the works of the Editor, connected with the science. The next is &#9651; of &#9791;, which shews an increase of students, and public discussion. The next is &#10038; of &#9794;, denoting increase of powerful friends, who will boldly advocate the cause of the science. The &#10038; of &#9797; is of little import; but the &#9651; of &#9737; being the last aspect she forms before leaving the sign, decidedly shews that at last the science will receive the highest patronage, and be publicly honoured; and as &#9737; is in &#9804;, a fixed sign, this will be permanent. Finally, the cusp of the 4th is in the term as well as house of &#9794;, and is ruled by &#9737;, by triplicity, and face; and &#9737; casts a &#9651; thereto; &#9794;, lord of the 4th, is in &#9740; with &#9795;, in &#10038; to &#9791; and &#9789;, and &#9651; to &#9796; and &#9792;; and he rules the &#9789; by house and face, and the &#9737; by face. All these are decided testimonies, that in the end the cause of truth shall triumph, and the reality and utility of the science be permanently established. &#9791; in a fixed sign, and so powerfully aspected by &#9796;, &#9795;, &#9794;, (lord of the 4th, the house denoting the end of the matter) &#9792; and &#9789;, is another strong evidence that ASTROLOGY IS DESTINED TO FLOURISH WHILE THE WORLD ENDURES!</p>  
<p>N.B. It is remarkable that &#9791; had just passed the &#10038; of &#9792;, lady of the 2d (or house of property), from the 9th, and lady also of the 10th in the figure, and 9th (house of law) from the 9th. This shewed the benefit resulting to astrology, by the repeal of the law which taxed Almanacs, and which greatly injured the science. It is also remarkable, that &#9795; was exactly passing over the 2d degree of &#9802;, the cusp of the 10th (house of honour) from the 9th, about the 7th</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_262"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 262</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> February, 1835, when the last sheet of the former edition of this work went through the press; and at the same time &#9796; was in &#9806; 23&deg; 6', having just quitted the 9th house, where he had injured the interests of the science.</p>

<p align="center">A WOMAN ASKS OF HER HUSBAND, WHO IS AT SEA; IF ALIVE? WHEN RETURN?</p>  
<p><i>Judgment</i>.--The lord of the ascendant &#9791;, shews the querent. He being with &#9789; and &#9796; in &#9800;, which rules the face, she was extremely disfigured in the face by small pock,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_263"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 263</FONT></A></p>  
<p>had weak eyes, &amp;c., and was full of grief and sorrow for her husband, occasioned by &#9796; afflicting &#9791;. She had also a lisp, and spoke ill; for &#9796; in a bestial sign afflicting &#9791;, causes impediments in speech, especially if also &#9789; be afflicted.</p>  
<p>&#9795; signified the quesited, who being in the 10th, and lately separated from &#10038; of &#9792;, now in the 9th, and lady of the 3d, it shewed that he had been lately some voyage south-east. And as &#9795; was no way afflicted and swift in motion, as well as angular, I judged the man was alive and in health. But as &#9791; who disposes of &#9795;, is lord of his 8th (viz. the 2d house), and as &#9789; is so exceedingly afflicted by &#9791; and &#9796;, I said he had been in much danger and peril of his life by treachery and plots of his adversaries; for &#9791; is lord of the 7th from his ascendant, and &#9796; of his 12th.</p>  
<p>Moreover, &#9795; is accidentally but not essentially fortified, and is in his detriment, and near <i>Oculus</i> &#9801;, a violent fixed star; intimating that the man had endured many sudden and violent chances.</p>  
<p>Finding &#9795; more fortified than &#9789;, she almost entering &#9801;, a southern sign, and &#9795; in &#9802;, a western sign, and south quarter, I judged that the quesited was in the south-west or England, in some harbour, as &#9795; was angular.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>When She should hear of Him, or see Him</i>?</p>  
<p>The &#9789; separates from &#9796;, and applies to &#9791;, the querent's significator; shewing that after much expectation, &amp;c., she should hear of him, and in about three days, as &#9789; is so near &#9791;, and in a moveable sign, (<i>and so she did</i>). But as &#9791; is in a moveable sign, and &#9789; afflicted by him and &#9796;, the news she heard was false, for she heard that he was in town; but it was not so. Considering that &#9791; and &#9795; hastened to a &#9740; in &#9802;, &#9791; being therein very potent, and that this was about the 5th May following, I judged that she would about that time</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_264"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 264</FONT></A></p>  
<p>have certain news of her husband, if he did not then come home. The second week in May she did hear from him, but he did not come home till July. He had been several voyages in the west, was taken prisoner by the king's forces, and, at the time of the question, was in Barnstaple.</p>

<p align="center">QUESTION: WHETHER PRESBYTERY SHALL STAND?</p>  
<p><i>Judgment</i>.--The angles of the figure are not fixed, but the cusp of the 9th, from which this judgment is to be deduced, is &#9801;, a fixed and stable sign; and we must also judge from</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_265"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 265</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> &#9796; therein in the terms of &#9795;, who is the general significator of religious matters. &#9795; is now stationary, and is leaving his exaltation, and is impedited by &#9794;; after leaving &#9803;, he enters the fixed sign &#9804;, and is in the terms of &#9796;. We find &#9792;, who rules the 9th, in her detriment, and in the 12th house from her own, the 9th. She has twenty-one degrees to pass through in the 8th house before she get into her own sign &#9801;, and where she would be fixed. But before she reaches &#9801;, she meets the &#9744; of &#9795;, (shewing that the gentry of England will oppose it), and then of &#9794;, (lord of the ascendant of England, &#9800;), hence the whole commonalty of the kingdom will disapprove of it), and all three planets at the time of the aspect in the term of &#9796;.</p>  
<p>There is not a single planet fixed, except &#9796;, nor essentially dignified, except &#9795;; the &#9789; entering <i>via combusta</i>, &#9794; and &#9791; in their fall, &#9792; in her detriment, and &#9795; impedited by &#9794;. The &#9789; separates from &#9792; in the 8th, and then goes to &#9744; of &#9794; and &#9795;. From these configurations we shall form our judgment, THAT POSTERITY MAY SEE THAT THERE IS SOME VERITY IN ASTROLOGY.</p>  
<p>The position of &#9796; in the 9th, who is naturally of a severe, surly, rigid, and harsh temper, may argue that Presbytery will be too strict, sullen, and dogged for the English constitutions; little gentle or compliant with the nature of the community. And that there shall spring up among themselves many strange opinions and distractions even, concerning this very Presbytery; that they shall grow excessively covetous, contentious, and desirous of more than belongs to them; worldly, envious, and malicious one against the other; that among them some juniors, represented by &#9792;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_119"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> shall be light in</p>

<p>judgment, wavering, and decline the strictness of their discipline; and that the elders, represented by &#9796;, shall not be respected on account of their excessive rigidness, nor shall their orthodox opinions be consented to.</p>  
<p>Observe, that &#9796; is peregrine, and supported by no favourable aspect of either fortune; there is reception between &#9789; and him, but no aspect: &#9791;, lord of the 10th, signifying authority, is fast separating from &#9796;, as if the gentry or supreme of the kingdom do already decline from the severity of the austere Presbyterian clergy, fearing thraldom rather than freedom to ensue from their power.</p>  
<p>Three whole years from hence shall not pass, ere authority itself, or some Divine Providence, will inform our judgment with a way in discipline or government either nearer to the former purity of the primitive times, or better beloved of the whole kingdom of England; or authority shall in this space of time moderate many things now strongly desired. For some time we shall not discover what shall be established, out all shall be even as when there was no king in Israel; a confusion among us shall yet awhile remain. The soldiery then, or some men of fiery spirits, will arise, and keep back their contribution from the clergy, and will deny obedience or submission to this thing called Presbytery. It will then come to be handled by the magistracy, and the grand authority of the kingdom. Also, by the plurality of the clergy, or men of sound judgment, it will be contradicted, disputed against, disapproved; and these shall make it manifest that this very Presbytery, now maintained, is not the same that the commonwealth of England will entertain as a standing rule to live under.</p>  
<p>From what I find by this figure, I conclude <i>that Presbytery shall not stand here in England</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_121"></A><A HREF="#fn_120"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>

<p align="center">QUESTION: WHETHER, THE QUERENT SHOULD OBTAIN THE PARSONAGE DESIRED?</p>  
<p><i>Judgment</i>.--In the first place, I find &#9740; between &#9795;, lord of the 9th, and &#9794;, lord of the ascendant, but separating.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_268"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 268</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> 2dly. Neither the &#9789;, nor lord of the ascendant, in the 9th. 3dly. There is no planet translating the light of &#9795; to &#9794;. 4thly. There is no reception between &#9795; and &#9794;. 5thly. &#9796; is impedited in the ascendant, and by his presence afflicts the querent, and causes him to despair of success. 6thly, The &#9789; separates from a &#9651; of &#9794;, and applies to &#9741; of &#9791;, lord of the 3d; which intimated that some neighbour of the querent, either with a letter, words, or cross information, would wholly destroy the querent's hopes; and that mercurial men, viz. scholars or divines, would be his enemies: and as I found &#9792; in &#9806;, opposing the ascendant, I judged that some female would inform against him, or prejudice him in his suit.</p>  
<p>From all this I persuaded him against proceeding any further in the matter; but the parson being covetous, would proceed, and did: and when he thought to have success, behold a scurvy letter, revealing some unpleasant truths concerning a female, dashed the good man's hopes, <i>et exit</i>.</p>  
<p>The querent was &#9796; and &#9794; exactly, had wit and volubility of tongue; and as &#9791; and &#9789; were in &#9741;, he under the earth, she in the 12th, he could never discover which of his neighbours it was that thus injured him; nor would he ask me.
