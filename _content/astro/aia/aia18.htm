<P><A NAME="fn_43"></A><A HREF="aia18.htm#fr_43">59:1</A> In all cases, I think the hair will be found to be of the colour given by the planet near to or aspecting closely the degree ascending, or on the cusp of the house which signifies the party. I find that &#9802; more frequently gives brown hair in questions.--ZAD.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_44"></A><A HREF="aia18.htm#fr_44">60:1</A> There is little doubt that this disease took its name from the astrological fact, that the sign &#9803; rules the breast, in which it generally occurs. Persons born with this sign ascending have always some defect, scar, mark, or disease in the breast.--ZAD.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_45"></A><A HREF="aia18.htm#fr_45">60:2</A> This term signifies, that if a person be born under or signified by this sign, or if they have &#9789; therein, and at all afflicted by the malefics, they will have less of humane feelings than when under any other sign, except the last half of &#9808;. They do not sympathize with other persons' sufferings, or feel compassion.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_46"></A><A HREF="aia18.htm#fr_46">62:1</A> The early part of the sign gives brown hair.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_47"></A><A HREF="aia18.htm#fr_47">62:2</A> If &#9797; ascend therein, the limbs will be long and the body taller.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_48"></A><A HREF="aia18.htm#fr_48">65:1</A> This remark of the author confirms our previous opinion, that the colour of the hair in questions depends on the ruler of the term ascending: in nativities, or the planets aspecting the ascendant, as well as the sign ascending.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_49"></A><A HREF="aia18.htm#fr_49">66:1</A> The Princess Charlotte of Wales was born with this sign ascending; it gives more beauty than any other sign except &#9806;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_50"></A><A HREF="aia18.htm#fr_50">66:2</A> Eclipses in m cause great innovations in the state in England: comets plunge the nation into war. The greatest changes have occurred in the laws while &#9797; has been in &#9810;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_51"></A><A HREF="aia18.htm#fr_51">67:1</A> This sign denotes standing water, as &#9803; does running water.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_52"></A><A HREF="aia18.htm#fr_52">67:2</A> I have generally found persons born under this sign have a very delicate skin, and often a white chalky appearance, and flabby.--ZAD.</P>
