He governs wholly the watery triplicity, viz. &#9803;, &#9807;, and &#9811;.</p>

<p><i>When ill dignified</i>.--Then he is a prattler, without modesty or honesty; a lover of slaughter and quarrels, murder, thievery, a promoter of sedition, frays, and commotions; an highway thief, as wavering as the wind, a traitor, of turbulent spirit, perjured, obscene, rash, inhuman, neither fearing God nor</p>
