<p>THE ascendant and its lord are for the querent, the 7th and its lord for him you would speak with; but if it be with any relation, take the house signifying that relation and its lord; as, for the father the 4th, for a child the 5th, and for an intimate friend the 11th; if the lord of the 7th, or quesited's significator, be in any of the four angles, the party is at home; but if he be in a succeedent house, he is not far from home; but if in a cadent house, then he is far from home.</p>  
<p>If you find the lord of the ascendant apply to the quesited's perfect aspect the same day you intend to visit him, you may be assured either to meet him going to his house, or hear of him by the way; or, if any planet separate from the lord of the quesited's house, and transfer his light to the lord of the ascendant, you will learn where he is by a person signified by</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_96"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 96</FONT></A></p>  
<p>that planet. Describe the planet, and it personates the individual; and the nature of the planet, sign, and quarter of heaven it is in will, by the plurality of testimonies, shear whether it be male or female.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>Of a thing suddenly happening, whether it signifies Good or Evil</i>?</p>  
<p>Erect your figure of heaven at the exact time of any event happening, or when you first heard of it: then consider who is lord of the ascendant, and which planet disposes of &#9737; and &#9789; and see if either of these be in the ascendant, and, if more than one, take the most powerful; and let his position be well considered. If he be in good aspect with &#9737;, &#9795;, or &#9792;, there will no evil arise from the accident, rumour, or whatever the event may be; but if you find that planet weak in the scheme, combust, or in evil aspect to &#9797;, &#9796;, &#9794;, or &#9792;, there will be some evil occur. If you consider the afflicting planet and his nature and position, you may learn the nature of the misfortune. If it be the lord of the 3d, it will come through some kinsman or neighbour, or by some short journey; if the lord of the 2d cast the ray, or the evil planet be in the 2d, it denotes loss of money;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_66"></A><A HREF="#fn_66"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> if the lord of the 4th. trouble about houses, &amp;c., or by means of a father or wife's mother; if the 5th, by intemperance, or by children, &amp;c., and so of the rest.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_67"></A><A HREF="#fn_67"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

<p>QUERY.--<i>What Mark, Mole, or Scar has the Querent on any Part of his Body? This is useful to prove that a question is radical, and to satisfy sceptics of the truth of the science</i>.</p>  
<p>When you have, upon any demand, erected the querent's figure, observe what member of man's body the ascending sign represents; for upon that part of his body will the querent have a mole, mark, or scar; as, if the ascendant be &#9800;, the same will be on the head; if &#9801;, it will be on the neck; if &#9802;, on the arms or shoulders, &amp;c.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_68"></A><A HREF="#fn_68"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> And also in the part ruled by the sign in which the lord of the ascendant is, will there be another mark.</p>  
<p>The signs on the cusp of the 6th house, and that in which the lord of the 6th is, will give other marks on the parts they rule. Also the sign in which &#9789; is found will give a mark in that part it governs.</p>  
<p>If &#9796; give the mark, it is dark, obscure, or black; &#9794; usually gives a red mole; but if he be in a fiery sign, it is generally a cut or scar.</p>  
<p>If the sign or planet signifying the mark or mole be much afflicted, the mark, &amp;c. will be more obvious and eminent.</p>  
<p>If the sign or planet be masculine, the mark is on the <i>right</i> side of the body; but if they be feminine, on the <i>left</i> side. And if the significator of the mole, &amp;c. be <i>above</i> the horizon, the mark or mole will be on the <i>fore part</i>, or visible to the eye, or on the outside of the member, &amp;c.; but if the planet be <i>below</i> the earth, it will be found on the inside, of</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_98"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 98</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>hinder part</i>, or not visible. If few degrees are on the cusp of the house, or the planet signifying the mole, &amp;c. be in few degrees of the sign, the mark, mole, &amp;c., will be in the upper part of the member. If they be in the middle of the sign, it will be in the middle of the member or part ruled by the sign. But if the latter degrees ascend, or are on the 6th, or their lords, or &#9789; be in the latter degrees of a sign, then will the mark, mole, or scar be near the lower part of the member. If your question be radical, and the time rightly taken, the above rules will always exactly hold good. And so will they (<i>mutatis mutandis</i>) upon the body of the quesited; for if a person inquire concerning his wife, then the sign on the 7th and its lord will shew the woman's marks; and the sign on the 12th, (the 6th from the 7th), and its lord will shew two other marks.</p>  
<p>Many times if the &#9789; be in &#9740; or &#9741; &#9737;, the querent has some blemish in or near his eyes: and this is ever true, if the &#9740; or &#9741; be in angles, and &#9789; or &#9737; be afflicted by Mars.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_69"></A><A HREF="#fn_69"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center"><i>Whether one absent be dead or alive</i>?</p>  
<p>If the quesited have no relation to the querent, then the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_90"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 90</FONT></A></p>  
<p>ascendant, its lord, and &#9789; shall signify the absent person.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_70"></A><A HREF="#fn_70"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> But if the party inquired after be a relation, then take the house and its lord which signifies that relation; as the 3d for a brother or sister, The 4th for a father, the 6th for a paternal uncle or aunt, the 10th for a mother, &amp;c.</p>  
<p>In judging this question, see whether the quesited's lord of the 1st and 8th be joined corporally together in the 8th, or be in &#9741; from the 6th or 8th. These are tokens of his being sick or near to death. See if there be any translation of light between the lord of his ascendant and the 8th, or if the lord of the 8th being in his ascendant, the lord of his ascendant be also in the 8th; or the lord of the 8th in the 4th, and the lord of the 4th in the 8th; these are all tokens that the party is dead; especially if his significator be much afflicted by ill aspects, and the evil planets be angular, and the good ones cadent.</p>  
<p>If the lord of his ascendant be separating from ill aspect of the lord of the 6th, the absent party has been lately sick; if from the lord of the 8th, he has been near death, but is not dead, without other striking testimonies, as above, concur. If from the lord of the 12th, he has been troubled with anxiety about arrests or fear of imprisonment; and if his significator be in the 12th, he is in much trouble by means of a private enemy; and if in a fixed sign, and other testimonies of trouble agree, he is in prison. If he separate from the lord of the 2d by ill aspect, he is now suffering by want of money If from the lord of the 7th, he has had some quarrel or contention. If the 9th, trouble on journeys or by law, &amp;c. and so of the other houses. I have ever found that if the lord of his ascendant be in the 9th, 10th, or 11th, though reported</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_100"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 100</FONT></A></p>  
<p>dead, he was alive. If you find him alive, and would know when you will hear from or see him, observe in the Ephemeris when the lord of the querent's 11th and the quesited's ascendant come to &#10038; or &#9651; aspect: about that time news of him will arrive. If the &#9789; apply to &#10038; or &#9651; of his significator, then allow a day, week, or month, for each degree she be distant, according as the significators may be placed in angles, succeedent or cadent houses, and the signs be moveable, common, or fixed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_71"></A><A HREF="#fn_71"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>

<p>1st QUERY.---<i>A Woman demanded whether her Son was with his Master at her own House</i>?</p>  
<p>In this figure, &#9792; lady of the ascendant denotes the querent. The 5th house is that of children, and describes the matter inquired of. I found &#9795;, lord of the 5th, youth's significator, in the east angle; one argument that the party was at home at his mother's house. The &#9789; was applying to &#10038; of &#9796; lord of the 4th, the significator of the querent's dwelling: I judged that she would find him there at her coming home: which she did. Now, had I found &#9795;, lord of the 5th, in the 10th, which house signifies the master; or had &#9789; separated from &#9795;, the youth's significator, and then applied to &#9737;, the &#9789; being in an angle, I would have judged him at his master's house. I considered further, that the 25th of July following at 2 P.M., the significators of the mother and son (&#9795; and &#9792;) came to &#9651; aspect; and therefore I judged that she should see him at that time: which she did. For usually about that day when the <i>significators</i> come to &#10038; or &#9651; aspect (which may be seen in the <i>Ephemeris</i>), it is very probable that news of, or a letter from, the quesited will arrive, if the distance will permit. But if the querent and quesited be not far asunder, without question they meet on that very day.</p>  
<p>Had the party inquired for been a stranger, he would have been denoted by &#9794; lord of the 7th; and being in the 2d, a <i>succeedent</i> house, I should have said he is not at home, but yet not far from home. And as the sign &#9808; is eastern, and the 2d house is north east, I should judge him in that direction; and as &#9808; governs fields, hills, or high grounds, 1 should direct a messenger, if sent for him, to go in that direction, and look for him in such places; hut if it were in a town, as &#9808; governs stables, fire-places, &amp;c., I should cause him to be sought near a stable, smith's or butcher's shop, &amp;c., as &#9794; delights in such places.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_103"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 103</FONT></A></p>  
<p>2d QUERY.--<i>A Thing suddenly happening, whether Good or Ill is about to follow</i>?</p>  
<p>The &#9737; is here lord of the sign he is in; &#9795; is lord of &#9811;, where &#9789; is; &#9792; is lady of the ascendant, and is casting a &#9651; to the ascendant, and is in &#9651; to &#9795;, and he in the ascendant; from all which we might safely have judged, had this been the time of a sudden accident, or thing done, that it could not have redounded to the querent's injury. But had &#9792; been nearer to &#9741; of &#9794;, he being in the 2d, I should have of judged that the querent would have received some loss of money shortly, and so of the rest.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>3d QUERY.--<i>What Moles or Marks the Querent has</i>?</p>  
<p>I find 25&deg; of &#9806; ascending and &#9795; in the ascendant, which signifies the face. This querent had a wart or mole on the right side of her face, near her mouth; for &#9795; and &#9806; are <i>masculine</i>. And as the latter degrees of &#9806; ascend, so the querent confessed a mole on the lower part of her reins towards the haunches. &#9800; being the sign of the 6th, shewed she had one on the forehead, near the hair, for the cusp of the house is but 4 degrees. &#9794; lord of the 6th, being in &#9808; a masculine sign and under the earth, shewed a mole on the right thigh, towards the middle of it, on the back part, or</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_104"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 104</FONT></A></p>  
<p>that part which is not visible. The &#9789; in 27th degree of &#9811;, a feminine sign, under the earth, I told her she had one mole under and towards the extremity of her left foot.</p>  
<p>The quesited being her son, had &#9811; for his ascendant, which denoted a mole on the left side of his cheek; and as &#9811; signifies the foot, so he had one on the left foot a little below the ancle, as few degrees ascend. The 6th from the 5th is the 10th in the figure, which having 4&deg; &#9804;, shewed that near his right side, below his breast, he had some scar, mole, or mark.</p>  
<p>In this way follow the directions of the rule.</p>  
<p>4th QUERY.--<i>Whether one absent be dead or alive</i>?</p>  
<p>In the aforesaid figure, the ascendant &#9795; therein and &#9792; its ruler, as also &#9789;, are the significators of the party absent. The ascending sign and &#9795; therein describe his person;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_73"></A><A HREF="#fn_73"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and &#9789; and &#9792; shew his condition.</p>  
<p>The &#9789; and &#9792; are free from any evil aspect of the lord of the 8th, and a benefit is in the ascendant, and &#9792; in the 9th; I should therefore pronounce the absent in health. But &#9792; having been recently in &#9741; to &#9794;, lord of the 2d and 6th, he had been lately in trouble about money, and also inclined to a feverish state. But by &#9795; in the ascendant, and in &#9651; to &#9792;, I should say that medicine, or such a person as is described by &#9795;, had relieved him. And as &#9791; lord of the 11th applies to a &#9744; of &#9795;, (both of them in signs of long ascension, which is equivalent to a &#9651;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_74"></A><A HREF="#fn_74"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> I should judge the querent to have news of the absent about ten weeks from the time of the</p>  
<p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_105"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 105</FONT></A></p>  
<p>question, because &#9791; wants ten degrees of the &#9744; of &#9795;. If the absent be known to be at a short distance from the quesited, I should have judged that in ten days they should hear of him, because the signs are moveable.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_75"></A><A HREF="#fn_75"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>

<p>And all these rules apply to the figure of birth, as well as horary figures; but <i>defects</i>, such as protrusion of the breast bone, or a humped back, &amp;c.

For example, her present majesty, having &#9796; in &#9811;, which rules the feet, and situated near the cusp of the 12th <i>house</i>, at her birth, she has a <i>weakness</i> in her feet.

<P><A NAME="fn_72"></A><A HREF="aia26.htm#fr_72">103:1</A> We consider that our author has been rather brief on this point, for numerous occasions occur where the mind is desirous of knowing the result when events happen. If &#9792; had been within orbs of &#9794; opposition, that is, <i>half the distance of their united orbs</i>, or 7&deg;; we should have judged loss of money by a party shewn by &#9792;, and her situation considered with the houses she governs. As, for example, &#9792; ruling the 12th, some private female enemy, among the relations of the wife or husband. because &#9792; is in the 3d from the 7th house. And as &#9794; is &#9741; to &#8853;, we should predict a loss by a servant (since &#9794; rules the 6th); and as &#8853; is in the 8th, it might be by one who comes to char or go messages; if &#8853; had been in a watery sign, a washerwoman.
