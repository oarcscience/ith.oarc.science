### APHORISMS, BY ZADKIEL.

1st. In all cases of hearing rumours or reports, receiving letters or
messages, &c., if you erect a figure for the exact minute of hearing or
reading the news, &c., the lord of the 3d in good aspect with the cusp
of the 7th, or a planet in the 7th, shews that the news is *true*, and
that you are not deceived; if he be in evil aspect, either semi-square,
☐, sesquiquadrate, or ☍, the news is *false*.

2d. Whenever any person applies to another on any business whatever,
either by letter, message, or personally, the 1st house represents him
who is the first mover in the matter, who either goes or sends to the
other, and the 7th represents the person applied to. Therefore, when a
person reads a report in a newspaper, or elsewhere, the 7th shews that
person, because the report, &c. comes. as it were, to him.

3d. If you apply to a person for goods of any kind, and they are
promised, the application of the lord of the 2d to the lord of the 8th,
or a planet therein, shews the time when they will be received.

4th. If you receive a bill of exchange, the figure for that time will
shew whether it will be paid. If ⊕ receive a good aspect of the lord of
the 1st, it will be paid; but if ⊕ receive any evil aspect of the lord
of the 1st, it will not be paid. *Probatum est*.

The ⊕ always denotes money, whether in cash or bills; but *property*,
whether in goods or lands, houses, &c., is always shewn by the lord of
the 2d, or a planet therein.
