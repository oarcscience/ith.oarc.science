In accordance with Dr. Libman's wishes it was named The Hideyo Noguchi Lectureship to pay tribute to the memory of the distinguished Japanese scientist.</p>
<p>The present volume owes its origin to the eleventh lecture on this foundation which was delivered on December 15, 1953, at The Johns Hopkins Institute of the History of Medicine by Professor Alexandre Koyré.</p></td>
