<p align="center"><b>Read the following Testimonials, and then send your subscription for this Wonderful, Inspiring and Helpful Magazine</b></p>  
<p>John Carlton Barnaby, Gig Harbor, Pierce Co., Wash., in sending his subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p>I think <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Magazine of Mysteries</span> is the best periodical I have ever read, and I have read a good many. It is food for the soul.</p>  
<p>Miss E. Willie Lightfoot, Brisbane, Ark., in sending her subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p>This Magazine may be improved by becoming weekly, semi-weekly, then daily, as the Mystic Membership grows larger, the circulation greater, while the contributors get purer, brighter and deeper in thought. May the South get into this circle, too.</p>  
<p>George Brand, Anaconda, Montana, in sending his subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p>I am very well pleased with your Magazine. I have been looking for something of the kind for some time, and it is my everyday handbook and guide.</p>  
<p>Mrs. Wm. H. Stilwell, 1804 West Monroe St., Phoenix, A. Ty., in sending her subscription for one year, says: My trial subscription of three months has been very satisfactory, and I find much of interest and that which is helpful in your journal.</p>  
<p>Katherine Pearce, 78 Walnut St., Newark, N. J., in sending her subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p>I cannot well advise any change in your Magazine. The only copy I have seen pleases me very much. I have been helped and comforted by the many beautiful thoughts printed therein, and hope and believe the future numbers will prove equally inspiring.</p>  
<p>Anna A. Goodwin, 19 1&#8211;2 Swan St., Green Island, N. Y., in sending her subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p>About two months ago I was lonesome one Saturday night and entered a large book-store to see if I could find something interesting to read. While waiting for the clerk, I picked up a copy of your Mystic Magazine, came home and read and re-read the contents, receiving so much consolation from it I waited the April issue with impatience, which came and has been studied through with untold good. It is the very best paper I have ever read.</p>  
<p>Miss E. Southergill, Farmington, Conn., in sending her subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p>I find your Magazine soul-inspiring and helpful.</p>

<p>I enjoy reading the Magazine very much, and feel much better for reading it, and I will do what I can in my humble way to help it along.</p>  
<p>Mrs. M. J. Smithey, 1446 Columbia Ave., Indianapolis, Ind., in sending her subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p>Your Magazine cannot be improved; it is splendid.</p>  
<p>Margaret Aird, 47 12th St., Buffalo, N. Y., in sending her subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p>This is the first of your magazines that I have seen or read, and have enjoyed the reading very much. It is altogether a book that helps to lift one's mind off the petty things of this life to a higher and nobler life above. But as for the improvement of the Magazine I can't say anything until I get better acquainted with it.</p>  
<p>Mary F. Johnson, 28 W. 13th St., Wilmington, Del., in sending her subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p>After reading very carefully the booklets you sent me, and the request of me becoming a subscriber to this valuable grand Magazine, I am more than glad so to do. I am more than pleased with it. I never in all my life saw anything near like it. It not only entrances, but holds you with rapport and delight, and I cannot express fully the pleasure and happiness it affords me.</p>  
<p>Lewis H. Karn, Port Orange, Fla., in sending his subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p>The sample copy of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Magazine of Mysteries</span> came to hand, and I am very much pleased with it. I enclose you $1.00 for one year's subscription.</p>  
<p>Ellsworth E. Worden, Portland, Ore., in sending in his subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p>I have bought several copies of your Magazine. I think it is a wonderful Magazine, just what I have been wanting to find in the line of reading. Hold it up to its high standard and you will do a world of good. I send you one dollar for a year's subscription.</p>  
<p>Maynard Oxley, Extension, B. C., Can., in sending in his subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p>I received the sample copy of the Magazine and was very much interested in it. It is the best I have ever seen. Madame Theodore Rodriguez, Port au Prince, Haiti, in sending in her subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p>Having been privileged (through the goodness of Dr. Tabourin Holly) to read your valuable Magazine, I feel much interested in same. Actuated by none other but a fervent desire toward the love of God and divine knowledge, I take the liberty of enclosing subscription price.</p>  
<p>Thos. A. Clarke, 2723 Bryant Ave., San Francisco, Cal., in sending in his subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p><a name="page_iii"><font size="1" color="green">p. iii</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">MAGAZINE OF MYSTERIES&#8217; TESTIMONIALS&#8212;(Continued)</h5>  
<p>I am so happy I have found such a comforting and helping paper as your <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Magazine of Mysteries</span>. It has done so much for me and I am sure it will do the same for others. I saw it in one of the stores one day, and something kept urging me for a week to go and buy it. Now, since I have got work, I am able to be one of your subscribers, and to continue so. I will try and interest all my friends in buying your paper also, for it is a blessing to all who will read and re-read it as I do. I even sleep with it under my pillow, and send a little prayer to God for others and myself to lead us onward with His Holy Spirit, and keep us from sin.</p>  
<p>John Howell, 518 Grand Ave., Los Angeles. Cal., in sending in his subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p>Inclosed please find an order for one dollar, in return for which please send me your splendid Magazine beginning with the May number. I purchased a copy of your March number at the bookstall here, thinking that it was a fortune-telling affair, and to say I was pleasurably surprised when I began to peruse its pages is a mild way of expressing my delight at having made the acquaintance of the best publication in existence, bar the Bible. Candidly, sir, I believe that the chance purchase of your Magazine marks the great epoch and turning-point in my life, for although I have belonged to a church all my life, and have been confirmed, your Magazine was the first light that has come to me. I read your March and April numbers through, not missing a word, and although I would like to do so, I cannot find words to express to you how much good I have derived from the soul-inspiring words they contain.</p>  
<p>Isaac M. Myers, Ligonier, Ind., in sending his subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p>Your welcome <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Magazine of Mysteries</span> and the postal card at hand, which I received March 13th. I am a strong advocate of what the Magazine teaches. I feel that it is the paper that will help to keep our courage and faith strong in the power of the Divine Jehovah, Father, and the Son Jesus and the Holy Spirit. I am thankful to the subscriber of your paper that suggested my name to you. I believe that the paper should be in every person's hands, that is trying to do right and live up to the first commandment, to love God, the Father, and his neighbor as himself. If you wish, send my delineation of my life. I will feel very grateful to you.</p>  
<p>Mrs. Mary A. Smith, 131 Meadow St., Pittsburgh, Pa., in sending in her subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p>I have been reading your excellent paper for some time and I cannot speak too highly of it. I get more knowledge and comfort from the reading of it than any other paper or publication of the kind that I have ever read. I look upon it as a friend and adviser. Heretofore, I have got the paper at the news depot, but I have trouble sometimes to get them; therefore, I am going to subscribe for it by the year.</p>

<p>Mrs. F. Lindquist, 400 Roscoe St., Chicago, Ill., in sending her subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p>Let me thank you for <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Magazine of Mysteries</span>. It is beautiful, sweet and true. I have read and read it over and over again and never get tired of reading, and you can be sure that I shall try my best to get you customers for it. I find every word so inspiring and elevating, and I wish you success with all my heart.</p>  
<p>Morris Rodman, 1837 Third Ave., N. Y., in sending in his subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p>I have fortunately happened to come across your highly valuable Magazine, and have read it for the last few months, and derived so much pleasure by reading that I actually do not know how I could get along without it. I can gladly call it my instructive companion for my life, and would not part with it for the best thing in the world. I have long been searching for something of that character, and found it at last, which is the knowledge I so long craved for.</p>  
<p>Lydia A. Irons, Milan, Spokane Co., Wash., in sending in her subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p>I can find no words strong enough to express my keen appreciation of all the articles by Mr. J. M. Peebles and C. Fannie Allyn on Spiritualism, and the articles by Hindu writers are particularly helpful to me. Such belief brings with it comfort and peace of mind and would change all this world's sadness to joy. If all issues are equal to this one it surely is valuable.</p>  
<p>J. M. Righter, Cambria, Wyoming, in sending in his subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p>I received your Magazine. I was much pleased with it. I never have had any publication of such a cheerful nature. At this time I am sorely in need of encouragement, and trust it may reform my whole life.</p>  
<p>Rev. M. M. Marshall, Montesano, Wash., in sending his subscription for one year, says:</p>  
<p>I am pleased with <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Magazine of Mysteries</span>. You certainly deserve not only encouragement but the heartfelt gratitude of all who read it. Whenever I find opportunity to call the attention of any who would be likely to appreciate it, to its merits. I shall do so.</p>
