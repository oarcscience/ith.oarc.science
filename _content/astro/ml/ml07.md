### III. THE WOMAN IN THE MOON.

"O woman! lovely woman! nature made thee  
To temper man; we had been brutes without you.  
Angels are painted fair, to look like you:  
There's in you all that we believe of heaven  
Amazing brightness, purity, and truth,  
Eternal joy, and everlasting love."  
                        (Otway's *Venice Preserved*, 1682.)

It is not good that the man in the moon should be alone; therefore
creative imagination has supplied him with a companion. The woman in the
moon as a myth does not obtain to any extent in Europe; she is to be
found chiefly in Polynesia, and among the native races of North America.
The *Middle* <span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

Kingdom furnishes the following allusion: "The universal legend of the
man in the moon takes in China a form that is at least as interesting as
the ruder legends of more barbarous people. The 'Goddess of the Palace
of the Moon,' Chang-o, appeals as much to our sympathies as, and rather
more so than, the ancient beldame who, in European folk-lore, picks up
perpetual sticks to satisfy the vengeful ideas of an ultra-Sabbatical
sect. Mr. G. C. Stent has aptly seized the idea of the Chinese versifier
whom he translates

"On a gold throne, whose radiating brightness  
  Dazzles the eyes--enhaloing the scene,  
Sits a fair form, arrayed in snowy whiteness.  
  She is Chang-o, the beauteous Fairy Queen.  
Rainbow-winged angels softly hover o'er her,  
  Forming a canopy above the throne;  
A host of fairy beings stand before her,  
  Each robed in light, and girt with meteor zone.'" <span

A touching tradition is handed down by Berthold that the moon is Mary
Magdalene, and the spots her tears of repentance. <span
id="fr_63"></span>[63](ml21.htm#fn_65) Fontenelle, the French poet and
philosopher, saw a woman in the moon's changes. "Everything," he says,
"is in perpetual motion; even including a certain young lady in the
moon, who was seen with a telescope about forty years ago, everything
has considerably aged. She had a pretty good face, but her cheeks are
now sunken, her nose is lengthened, her forehead and chin are now
prominent to such an extent, that all her charms have vanished, and I
fear for her days." "What are you relating to

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

me now?" interrupted the marchioness. "This is no jest," replied
Fontenelle. "Astronomers perceived in the moon a particular figure which
had the aspect of a woman's head, which came forth from between the
rocks, and then occurred some changes in this region. Some pieces of
mountain fell, and disclosed three points which could only serve to
compose a forehead, a nose, and an old woman's chin." <span
id="fr_64"></span>[64](ml21.htm#fn_66) Doubtless the face and the
disfigurements were fictions of the author's lively imagination, and his
words savour less of science than of satire; but Fontenelle was neither
the first nor the last of those to whom "the inconstant moon that
monthly changes" has been an impersonation of the fickle and the
feminine. The following illustration is from Plutarch: "Cleobulus said,
As touching fooles, I will tell you a tale which I heard my mother once
relate unto a brother of mine. The time was (quoth she) that the moone
praied her mother to make her a peticoate fit and proportionate for her
body. Why, how is it possible (quoth her mother) that I should knit or
weave one to fit well about thee considering that I see thee one while
full, another while croissant or in the wane and pointed with tips of
horns, and sometime again halfe rounde?" <span
id="fr_65"></span>[65](ml21.htm#fn_67) Old John Lilly, one of our
sixteenth-century dramatists, likewise supports this ungallant theory.
In the *Prologus* to one of his very rare dramas he writes:

"Our poet slumb'ring in the muses laps,  
Hath seen a woman seated in the moone." <span
id="fr_66"></span>[66](ml21.htm#fn_68)

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This woman is
Pandora, the mischief-maker among the Utopian shepherds. In Act v. she
receives her commission to conform the moon to her own mutability:

"Now rule *Pandora* in fayre *Cynthia's* steede,  
And make the moone inconstant like thyselfe,  
Raigne thou at women's nuptials, and their birth,  
Let them be mutable in all their loves.  
Fantasticall, childish, and folish, in their desires  
Demanding toyes; and stark madde  
When they cannot have their will."

In North America the woman in the moon is a cosmological myth. Take, for
example, the tale told by the Esquimaux, which word is the French form
of the Algonquin Indian *Eskimantsic*, "raw-flesh eaters." "Their
tradition of the formation of the sun and moon is, that not long after
the world was formed, a great conjuror or angikak became so powerful
that he could ascend into the heavens when he pleased, and on one
occasion took with him a beautiful sister whom he loved very much, and
also some fire, to which he added great quantities of fuel, and thus
formed the sun. For a time the conjuror treated his sister with great
kindness, and they lived happily together; but at last he became cruel,
ill-used her in many ways, and, as a climax, burnt one side of her face
with fire. After this last indignity she ran away from him and became
the moon. Her brother in the sun has been in chase of her ever since;
but although he sometimes gets near, will never overtake her. When new
moon, the burnt side of her face is towards

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

the earth; when full moon, the reverse is the case." <span
id="fr_67"></span>[67](ml21.htm#fn_69) The likeness between this
tradition and the Greenlanders' myth of Malina and Anninga is very
close, the difference consisting chiefly in the change of sex; here the
moon is feminine, there the moon is masculine. <span
id="fr_68"></span>[68](ml21.htm#fn_70)

In Brazil the story is further varied, in that it is the sister who
falls in love, and receives a discoloured face for her offence.
Professor Hartt says that Dr. Silva de Coutinho found on the Rio Branco
and Sr. Barbosa has reported from the Jamundá a myth "in which the moon
is represented as a maiden who fell in love with her brother and visited
him at night, but who was finally betrayed by his passing his blackened
hand over her face." <span id="fr_69"></span>[69](ml21.htm#fn_71)

The Ottawa tale of Indian cosmogony, called Iosco, narrates the
adventures of two Indians who "found themselves in a beautiful country,
lighted by the moon, which shed around a mild and pleasant light. They
could see the moon approaching as if it were from behind a hill. They
advanced, and the aged woman spoke to them; she had a white face and
pleasing air, and looked rather old, though she spoke to them very
kindly. They knew from her first appearance that she was the moon. She
asked them several questions. She informed them that they were halfway
to her brother's (the sun), and that from the earth to her abode was
half the distance." <span id="fr_70"></span>[70](ml21.htm#fn_72)

Other American Indians have a tradition of an old woman who lived with
her grand-daughter, the most beautiful girl that ever was seen in the
country.<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

Coming of age, she wondered that only herself and her grandmother were
in the world. The grandam explained that an evil spirit had destroyed
all others; but that she by her power had preserved herself and her
grand-daughter. This did not satisfy the young girl, who thought that
surely some survivors might be found. She accordingly travelled in
search, till on the tenth day she found a lodge inhabited by eleven
brothers, who were hunters. The eleventh took her to wife, and died
after a son was born. The widow then wedded each of the others,
beginning with the youngest. When she took the eldest, she soon grew
tired of him, and fled away by the western portal of the hunter's lodge.
Tearing up one of the stakes which supported the door, she disappeared
in the earth with her little dog. Soon all trace of the fugitive was
lost. Then she emerged from the earth in the east, where she met an old
man fishing in the sea. This person was he who made the earth. He bade
her pass into the air toward the west. Meanwhile the deserted husband
pursued his wife into the earth on the west, and out again on the east,
where the tantalizing old fisherman cried out to him, " Go, go; you will
run after your wife as long as the earth lasts without ever overtaking
her, and the nations who will one day be upon the earth will call you
*Gizhigooke*, he who makes the day." From this is derived *Gizis*, the
sun. Some of the Indians count only eleven moons, which represent the
eleven brothers, dying one after another. <span

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

Passing on to Polynesia, we reach Samoa, where "we are told that the
moon came down one evening, and picked up a woman, called Sina, and her
child. It was during a time of famine. She was working in the evening
twilight, beating out some bark with which to make native cloth. The
moon was just rising, and it reminded her of a great bread-fruit.
Looking up to it, she said, 'Why cannot you come down and let my child
have a bit of you?' The moon was indignant at the idea of being eaten,
came down forthwith, and took her up, child, board, mallet, and all. The
popular superstition is not yet forgotten in Samoa of the *woman* in the
moon. 'Yonder is Sina,' they say, 'and her child, and her mallet, and
board.'" <span id="fr_72"></span>[72](ml21.htm#fn_74) The same belief is
held in the adjacent Tonga group, or Friendly Islands, as they were
named by Captain Cook, on account of the supposed friendliness of the
natives. "As to the spots in the moon, they are compared to the figure
of a woman sitting down and beating *gnatoo*" (bark used for
clothing). <span id="fr_73"></span>[73](ml21.htm#fn_75)

In Mangaia, the southernmost island of the Hervey cluster, the woman in
the moon is Ina, the pattern wife, who is always busy, and indefatigable
in the preparation of resplendent cloth, *i.e.* *while clouds*. At Atiu
it is said that Ina took to her celestial abode a mortal husband, whom,
after many happy years, she sent back to the earth on a beautiful
rainbow, lest her fair home should be defiled by death. <span
id="fr_74"></span>[74](ml21.htm#fn_76) Professor Max Müller is reminded
by this story of Selênê and Endymion, of Eos and Tithonos.
