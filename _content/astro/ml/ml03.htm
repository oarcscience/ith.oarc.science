<p>THIS work is a contribution to light literature, and to the literature of light. Though a monograph, it is also a medley.</p> 
<p>The first part is mythological and mirthsome. It is the original nucleus around which the other parts have gathered. Some years since, the writer was led to investigate the world-wide myth of the Man in the Moon, in its legendary and ludicrous aspects; and one study being a stepping-stone to another, the ball was enlarged as it rolled.</p> 
<p>The second part, dealing with moon-worship, is designed to show that anthropomorphism and sexuality have been the principal factors in that idolatry which in all ages has paid homage to the hosts of heaven, as <i>heaved</i> above the aspiring worshipper. Man adores what he regards as higher than he. And if the moon is supposed to affect his tides, that body becomes his water-god.</p> 
<p>The third part treats of lunar superstitions, many of which yet live in the vagaries which sour and shade our modern sweetness and light.</p> 
<p><a name="page_xiv"><font size="1" color="green">p. xiv</font></A></p> 
<p>The fourth and final part is a literary essay on lunar inhabitation, presenting <i>in nuce</i> the present state of the enigma of "the plurality of worlds."</p> 
<p>Of the imperfections of his production the author is partly conscious. Not <i>wholly</i> so; for others see us often more advantageously than we see ourselves. But a hope is cherished that this work--a compendium of lunar literature in its least scientific branches--may win a welcome which shall constitute the worker's richest reward. To the innumerable writers who are quoted, the indebtedness felt is inexpressible.</p>
