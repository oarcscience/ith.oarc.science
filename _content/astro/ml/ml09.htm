<p>We owe an immense debt of gratitude and honour to the many enterprising and cultivated men who have gone into all parts of the earth and among all peoples to investigate human history and habit, mythology and religion, and thus enrich the stores of our national literature. With such a host of travellers gathering up the fragments, nothing of value is likely to be lost. We have to thank intelligent explorers for all we know of the mythical frog or toad in the moon: an addition to our information which is not unworthy of thoughtful notice.</p> 
<p>The Selish race of North-west American Indians, who inhabit the country between the Cascade and Rocky Mountains, have a tradition, which Captain Wilson relates as follows: "The expression of 'a toad in the moon,' equivalent to our 'man in the moon,' is explained by a very pretty story relating how the little wolf, being desperately in love with the toad, went a-wooing one night and prayed that the moon might shine brightly on his adventure; his prayer was granted, and by the clear light of a full moon he was pursuing the toad, and had nearly caught her, when, as a last chance of escape, she made a desperate spring on to the face of the moon, where she remains to this day."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="ml21.htm#fn_93"><FONT SIZE="1">91</FONT></A> Another writer says that "the Cowichan tribes think that the moon has a frog in it."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_92"></A><A HREF="ml21.htm#fn_94"><FONT SIZE="1">92</FONT></A></p>

<p>Eastern world, and in China find the frog in the moon. "The famous astronomer Chang H&ecirc;ng was avowedly a disciple of Indian teachers. The statement given by Chang H&ecirc;ng is to the effect that 'How I, the fabled inventor of arrows in the days of Yao and Shun,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_93"></A><A HREF="#fn_1"><FONT SIZE="1">*70</FONT></A> obtained the drug of immortality from Si Wang Mu (the fairy 'Royal Mother' of the West); and Chang Ngo (his wife) having stolen it, fled to the moon, and became the frog--<i>Chang-chu</i>--which is seen there.' The lady <i>Chang-ngo</i> is still pointed out among the shadows in the surface of the Moon."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_94"></A><A HREF="ml21.htm#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">93</FONT></A> Dr. Wells Williams also tells us that in China "the sun is symbolized by the figure of a raven in a circle, and the moon by a rabbit on his hind legs pounding rice in a mortar, or by a three-legged toad. The last refers to the legend of an ancient beauty, Chang-ngo, who drank the liquor of immortality, and straightway ascended to the moon, where she was transformed into a toad, still to be traced in its face. It is a special object of worship in autumn, and moon cakes dedicated to it are sold at this season."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_95"></A><A HREF="ml21.htm#fn_96"><FONT SIZE="1">94</FONT></A> We have little doubt that what the Chinese look for they see. We in the West characterize and colour objects which we behold, as we see them through the painted windows of our predisposition or prejudice. As a great novelist writes: "From the same object different</p>

<p>conclusions are drawn; the most common externals of nature, the wind and the wave, the stars and the heavens, the very earth on which we tread, never excite in different bosoms the same ideas; and it is from our own hearts, and not from an outward source, that we draw the hues which colour the web of our existence. It is true, answered Clarence. You remember that in two specks of the moon the enamoured maiden perceived two unfortunate lovers, while the ambitious curate conjectured that they were the spires of a cathedral."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_96"></A><A HREF="ml21.htm#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">95</FONT></A> Besides, it must be confessed that the particular moon-patch that has awakened so much interest in every age and nation is quite as much like a frog or toad as it is like a rabbit or hare.</p>
