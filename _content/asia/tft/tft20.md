## The Rabbit and Bumblebee Bet

<span class="small">An empty-handed official has no chance, neither will
a wet vine cause the tea to boil.  
                                                 *Tibetan
Proverb*.</span>

ONE day a rabbit was sitting by the side of the road under a bunch of
nice grass, and near him sat a bumblebee on a big yellow flower. As they
sat talking together they made a bet; the rabbit saying, "I can swell up
bigger than you can," the bumblebee replying, "You can not." So they
decided to try. The rabbit swelled and swelled, and some one passing
said, "Look at that rabbit, he looks as big as a wolf." Then the
bumblebee puffed and puffed until some one passing said, "Look at that
bumblebee, he looks as big as a yak;" so he won the bet.
