This page links together resources at Intangible Textual Heritage
pertaining to traditional people of Asia, including Siberia and
Southeast Asia.

Asia is also the origin of many of the most important and ancient world
religions, including [Hinduism](../hin/index), [Buddhism](../bud/index),
[Confucianism](../cfu/index), and [Taoism](../tao/index). <span

[Northwestern](../nam/nw/index) Native Americans.
