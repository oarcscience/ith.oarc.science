"And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name
of the Lord; and they shall be afraid of thee."

Deliver from fetters Bambina, daughter of Rena, to praise Thy Name, and
may the merits of the Patriarchs shield her. A.N.S.V. (initials of the
words ‘Amen, Netzach, Tselah, Vaad).

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

In the Name of the Most High and the Cause of all Causes, the Exalted El
Jah, the God of Israel, I am that I am, High and Exalted, the Dweller in
Eternity; Whose name is Holy; And in the Name of the Almighty of
Sabaoth, Lord of Lords, Living and Existent for everlasting Ages. Amen,
Selah. And in the name of HVHY (*i.e.* the tetragrammaton).

Prosper me in the writing of this parchment, that it be a preservative,
deliverance, protection and a perfect cure to the wearer of this Charm
from sundry and divers evil diseases existing in the world, from an evil
eye and an evil tongue. I adjure you all ye kinds of evil eyes, a black

The Eye of the Lord is upon them that fear Him, and upon them that trust
in His Goodness."

NOTES

1\. The apparently meaningless combinations in capital and other
letters, shown in the above charm, are formed from the names of the
angels, the four streams of Paradise, etc. The belief is, that the
changes in the position of the letters make these various names more
effective and therefore render the amulet more powerful.

2\. In writing charms, etc., the father's name is never mentioned. The
reason alleged is the example of the Psalmist who prays, "O Lord, truly
I am thy servant; thy servant and the son of thy handmaid."

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

3\. It is not the object of this work to treat the question of Jewish
and Eastern angelology and demonology, amulets, etc., exhaustively. Much
interesting information on these and kindred subjects may be gathered
from the following English works.

Edersheim, "Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah," Appendices xiii., xvi.

Thomson, "Land and the Book," 1873, pp. 150, 151, etc.

Lane's, "Modern Egyptians," vol. i. pp. 300, 306, 317, 338, 361. vol.
ii. pp. 177, 256, 371.

4\. Besides written amulets like that of which a translation from the
original Hebrew is given above, it is customary amongst Jews and other
Orientals to wear different objects made of metal, glass, bone, etc., to
keep away evil spirits, and ward off the effects of the evil eye.
Amongst these objects we may mention, a wolf's bone, blue beads, and
silver figures of a pair of frogs (the sex of each figure being clearly
indicated), a sword, pistol, gun, battle-axe, pair of scissors,
scimitar, a hand, tooth, etc., or to wear a sprig of rue, or a copy of
the Koran, etc.

5\. The belief in the protective power of the name ‏יהוה‎ or YHVH is
shared by the Samaritans equally with the adherents of orthodox Judaism.
I have in my possession the photograph of a Samaritan charm written on
parchment, said to be several centuries old, and to have been used by
generation after generation of "the foolish people that dwell in Sichem"
(Ecclus. 1. 26), in order to cure sick folk of their ailments. It is
written in seven columns divided from each other by lines of Samaritan
writing in larger characters than those covering the greater part of the
document. A framework of two lines of such writing runs along the four
sides of the whole, and, on examination with a magnifier, is easily
decipherable as containing the account of the overthrow of Pharaoh and
his hosts in the sea. The columns are divided into sections by from two
to five lines of similar writing (the names of Jehovah, the words "And
Moses prayed," etc.), whilst between the divisions are paragraphs of
small and closely written lines. The size of this precious document, for
which the trifling sum of 5000 francs was coolly asked, is shown by the
scale of centimetres photographed with it. It was in a terribly dirty
and torn condition, having been worn, rolled, and folded up into a
bundle about 22 inches cube, and apparently next the skin. About the
middle of the eighth column is a "záir ‘geh" table, with letters
arranged inside squares, like that shown by Lane, vol. i. p. 356.

Note.--A remarkable thing in this charm is the omission of the names of
the four angels,  
Gabriel, Michael, Raphael, and Uriel.

TRANSLATION OF THE REMAINDER.

PROTECTION (OR AMULET)

FOR AN INFANT, AND A WOMAN IN CHILD-BED.

And in good luck.

Be reviled, O Satan!

Psalm cxxi., "A Psalm of degrees," from beginning to end.

Charm against Lilith vouched for as efficacious by several famous
Rabbis:--

 

"In the Name of YHVH the God of Israel Whose Name is great and to be
feared."

"Elijah, may his memory be blessed, was walking out one day when he came
upon Lilith. He said to her, 'Unclean one! where art thou going?' She
said to him, 'I am going to the house of So and So, who is in child-bed;
in order to cause her death and to snatch and devour her child.' He said
unto her, 'Be thou smitten with the itch, and imprisoned by the Name of
the Most Holy One, and become a silent stone.' She answered and said
unto him, 'O my lord, let me off, and I swear, in the Name of YHVH to
forsake this my way, and that whenever I shall see or hear any of my
names I shall straightway flee. And now I will make known to thee my
names. And whenever my names shall be mentioned I shall have no power to
do evil or to injure. I swear to thee to reveal my names, and if they be
written and suspended in the dwelling of the child or the confined woman
I shall at once flee.

"'These are my names:--Satrìnah, Lilith, Avìtu, Amìz Raphì, Amìzû,
Kakash, Odem, ’ìk, Pods, ’ìls, Petrota, Abro, Kema, Kalee, Bituah,
Thiltho, Partashah.

"'And whoever fixes up these my names I shall at once flee from the
placard hung up in the house of the confined woman or the child. This is
a charm, and the child as well as his mother shall never be hurt by
me.'"

 

CABBALISTIC DIRECTION.--Rabbi Eleazar of Garmiza, the author of the
Josephta, may his memory be blessed, says

"As a charm against pestilence and fire, from which may YHVH protect us,
let this be hung against the window or against (opposite to) the door
and at once they will flee." Thus

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

also Rabbi Arieh the Saint, has said in a MS. of his, "All this is very
marvellous, as also Rabbi Eliezar Baal Shem Tore says."

In a good sign.

Shaddai.

Solemn Adjuration of the Evil Eye. (As this, though abbreviated, is
almost identical with the Amulet translated on [p.
318](flhl40.htm#page_318) ff, there is no need to reproduce it here.)

Picture of a hand, on the back of which is written "Shaddai" (Almighty)
and "Adonai " (Lord)) with permutations of letters forming names of
angels, etc.
