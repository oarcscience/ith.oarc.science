al Mejìd, and by him presented to this mosque. Sultan Mahmûd was an
excellent writer, and hearing people vaunt the penmanship of a certain

without offence to the padishah, to be just to his more skilful rival.
On the latter's paper he wrote "The handwriting of the best of scribes";
on Mahmûd's, "The handwriting of the best of sultans and scribes." The
sultan, struck with his uprightness, made him a splendid present, and
sent the text which he had written to the Mosque El Aksa.
