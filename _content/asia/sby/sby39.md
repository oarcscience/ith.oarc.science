### DWELLINGS

In regard to their dwellings, the Yezidis are divided into two classes:
Ahl al-ḥaḍar, the people of the villages or cultivated land, and Ahl al
Wabar, the people of the tents. The villages are built of clay, stone or
mud, and unburned brick. A village consists of about sixty houses. A
house is divided into three principal rooms, opening one into another.
These are separated by a wall about six feet high, upon which are placed
wooden pillars supporting the ceiling. The roof rests on trunks of trees
raised on rude stones in the centre chamber, which is open on one side
to the air. The sides of the room are honeycombed with small recesses
like pigeon-holes. The whole is plastered with white plaster, fancy
designs in red being introduced here and there. The houses are kept neat
and clean. They say that cleanliness is next to heaven.

Now, the people of the tents are, like the Arab Bedouins, nomadic,
having no houses and no permanent place of abode. They form but a small
portion of the Yezidis, and are called Kotchar.
