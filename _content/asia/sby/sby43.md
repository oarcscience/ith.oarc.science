# CHAPTER VI

# LIST OF THE YEZIDI TRIBES

(The materials were collected for me by A. N. Andrus, of Mardin)

### THE TRIBES ACROSS THE RIVER FROM MOSUL

1 The tribe named Šeiḫan lives in the mountains of Al-Ḳôš, and has
sixteen villages. They are all under the orders of Šeiḫ ‘Ali Beg Paša,
the Amir, or chief of the Yezidis. This tribe can furnish 1,600 guns for
war. Said ‘Ali Paša has received from the Turkish government the order
of Amir ul-Umara "the Amir of Amirs." He has a brother who has received
the order of Miry Miran, "the Amirs of Amirs." He has a second brother
who has received the order of Romeli Beglar Begi, "the Beg of Begs."
These three are all sons of the former Amir Husein Beg.

2 The Denôdi tribe lives in Dakoke district. It occupies fifteen
villages, and can bring 800 guns to war.

3 The Howari tribe lives in the region of Zaḫo. This tribe is nomadic,
lives in tents, and can furnish 200 guns for war. It has two chiefs,
Bedri Sohr and Dar Bazi Ḥusein. They are all shepherds.

### THE TRIBES OF MIDYAT REGION, USUALLY CALLED JABAL TOR AL-‘ABEDIN (MOUNTAIN OF THE WORSHIPERS)

This region lies one day's journey east of Mardin. There are three
tribes here.

1 The tribe of Šemmike. This tribe inhabits six villages and can
produce, when needed, 500 guns.

2 The tribe called Soḥrani. There are fifteen small villages to this
tribe with 300 guns. These all have houses built of stone, and till the
ground.

3 The tribe called Mamila. This tribe has seven villages:

Mazazah, Bajinne, Kochano, Keunos, Taka, Harobia, and Namirdani.

Mr. Andrus writes me that he has learned of this tribe from Ḳas Samuel,
a Jacobite Syrian priest of Mazazeh near Midyat.

The tribe of Bešreyeh, northwest of Jabal Al-Tor.

There was only one tribe in this district; it was called Ḫaltah. This
tribe had five villages:

Reḍwan, Dooshah, Selaḫar, Bimbarik, and Ṣoolân.

On account of the oppression of the government on the one hand, and of
the Kurdish tribes around them on the other, this tribe has moved to the
Sinjar Mountains.

The tribes around Weran Šahr or Goran Šahr, "the destroyed or the sunken
city," because it was destroyed by earthquake or in war. This district
lies southwest of Mardin.

1 The Denodi tribe. This is probably an offshoot of the Dahoke tribe of
the same name. It occupies three villages, and has Ḥasan Ḳanjo for the
chief. He is now the right arm of Ibrahim Paša of the Ḥamideyeh army.
The three villages are Salmi, Payamlo and Desi.

head man.
