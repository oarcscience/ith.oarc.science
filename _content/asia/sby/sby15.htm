<p>They are divided into seven classes; and each class has functions peculiar to itself that cannot be discharged by any of the other classes. They are:</p>  
<p>1. &#352;ei&#7723;. He is the servant of the tomb, and a descendant of Imam, &#7716;asan al-Ba&#7779;r&icirc;. No one can give a legal decision or sign any document except the &#353;ei&#7723; who is the servant of &#352;ei&#7723; &#145;Ad&icirc;'s tomb. He has a sign by which he is distinguished from others. The sign is a belt which he puts on his body, and net-like gloves, which resemble the halters of camels. If he goes among his people, they bow down and pay him their respects. The &#353;ei&#7723;s sell a place in paradise to anyone who wishes to pay money.</p>  
<p>2. Emir. The emirship specifically belongs to the descendants of Yez&icirc;d. They have a genealogical tree, preserved from their fathers and forefathers, which goes up to Yez&icirc;d himself. The emirs have charge of .the temporal and governmental affairs, and have the right to say, "Do this and do not that,"</p>  
<p>3. &#7730;aww&acirc;l. He has charge of tambourines and flutes and religious hymns.</p>  
<p>4. P&icirc;r. To him appertain the conduct of fasts, the breaking of fasts, and hair-dressing.</p>  
<p>5. K&ocirc;chak. To him appertain the duties of religious</p>

<p>instruction, and sepulture, and interpretation of dreams, <i>i.e.</i>, prophecy.</p>  
<p>6. Fa&#7731;&icirc;r. To him appertain the duties of instruction of boys and girls in playing on the tambourines, in dancing and religious pleasure. He serves &#352;ei&#7723; &#145;Ad&icirc;.</p>  
<p>7. Mulla. To him appertain the duties of instructing children. He guards the books and the mysteries of religion and attends to the affairs of the sect.</p>
