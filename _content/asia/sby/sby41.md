### VII

### OCCUPATION

Generally speaking, the Yezidis are an industrious people, but they do
not engage in business. This is due to their belief that any form of
business leads to cheating and lying, and hence to cursing Melek-Ṭâ’ûs,
*i.e.*, the devil. Their usual occupation is agriculture and
cattle-raising. The Yezidis of Sinjar, who constitute almost the entire
population, raise fruit, such

as figs and grapes; also almonds and nuts. Jabal Sinjar is famous for
its figs. Those who live in the Russian territory, like the sweeper
class of India, are mainly engaged in menial work. But those in the
districts of Reḍwan and Midyat are given to housebreaking and highway
robbery; they are the terror of those regions.

The Yezidis seldom appear in the cities; and when they do they conceal
their peculiarities as much as possible, for the Christians and
Mohammedans are wont to seek amusement at their expense. When they find
a Yezidi in their company, they draw a circle about him on the ground,
from which he superstitiously believes he cannot get out, until some one
breaks it. They annoy him by crying out, Na‘lat Šaitan, *i.e.*, Satan be
cursed. Moreover, city people keep aloof from the habitations of these
despised devil-worshippers. Accordingly the Yezidis have little
intercourse with their neighbors.
