This is one of the only public domain sources of information on the
religious beliefs of the Yezidi, a small group originally from the
northern region of Iraq. Although they speak Kurdish, they are a
distinct population from the Kurds. The Yezidi are notable because they
have been described as devil-worshippers, which has, unfortunately, led
to constant persecution by the dominant Islamic culture of the region.
Yezidi religious beliefs upon closer examination appear to be a mixture
of Gnostic cosmology with Muslim, Christian and other influences. They
have many unique beliefs, such as that the first Yezidi were created by
Adam by parthenogenesis separately from Eve. They believe that there was
a flood before the flood of Noah. They also have a set of food taboos
which include meat, fish, squash, okra, beans, cabbage and lettuce.

Do they really worship the devil? In fact, you could just as well say
that they worship angels, and this might be the best way to spin this
for people who aren't interested in theological nuances, or have no
experience with such a radically 'different' belief system.

Joseph says: ([p. 155](sby24.htm#page_155)) "*It is interesting to note
that, in the history of religion, the god of one people is the devil of
another*." Their cosmology is so radically different from the dominant
paradigm that it is hard to translate the concepts. The Yezidis believe
in a single creator, who created a set of other deities which could be
just as well be called demons, angels, or gods. The primary one of
these, and the one that the Yezidi worship, is called Melek Ta\`us, who
is represented as a peacock. One scholar (whom Joseph disagrees with)
traces this name to that of Tammuz, the ancient Syrian deity. Joseph,
however, claims: ([p. 148](sby24.htm#page_148)) "*\[Melek Ta\`us\]
denotes the devil and nothing else. This is so clear to the Yezidis, or
to anyone acquainted with their religion, as to leave no need for
further discussion*".

In some polytheistic religions good and evil deities are worshipped
equally; the good gods so that good things will happen, and the evil
ones also are propitiated so that bad things won't happen. The Yezidi
theology differs in that God is so good that he has no need of worship;
Melek Ta\`us is sort of a firewall between this imperfect world and the
perfection of the supreme being. This is similar to beliefs of some
ancient [Gnostics](../../gno/index) that God, being purely good, had to
create a set of intermediaries, the Aeons. This is so that the Aeons, in
turn, could create a world which includes [evil](../../evil/index). It
should be kept in mind that, when this book was written, the Gnostics
were virtually unknown, save from opposing views in early Christian
writings.

The Yezidi have a strong ethical code and customs like those of many
other agricultural tribal people, as is apparent from the ethnological
sketch which rounds out this book. In spite of this, authors from [Paul
Carus](../../evil/hod/index) to H.P. Lovecraft have painted the Yezidi
as sinister worshippers of the evil one. Some of the poetry from this
book was borrowed in the 1960s by the Satanist Anton LaVey for his
liturgy. This image is simply not borne out by a close reading.

The Yezidi are important to the study of religions in a way that the
[Basque](../../neu/basque/index) are important to the study of
languages. Like the [Samaritans](../../jud/sam/index) or the Druze, they
are a little island of diversity in a world which is becoming
homogenized by globalism.

Some additional notes: The Yezidi 'Sacred Books' are reputedly never
shown to strangers. This book includes a set of translations from an
Arabic manuscript given to Joseph by a Muslim which purport to be the
text of these books. However, I have been unable to find any other third
party translation of these texts, so *caveat lector*. This etext uses
extended Latin characters and requires a Unicode compliant browser; for
more information refer to [the sacred-texts Unicode
page](../../unicode).
