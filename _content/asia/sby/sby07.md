### CHAPTER II

I requite the descendents of Adam, and reward them with various rewards
that I alone know. Moreover, power and dominion over all that is on
earth, both that which is above and that which is beneath, are in my
hand. I do not allow friendly association with other people, nor do I
deprive them that are my own and that obey me of anything that is good
for them. I place my affairs in the hands of those whom I have tried and
who are in accord with my desires. I appear in divers manners to those
who are faithful and under my command. I give and take away; I enrich
and impoverish; I cause both happiness and misery. I do all this in
keeping with the characteristics of each epoch. And none has a right to
interfere with my management of affairs. Those who oppose me I afflict
with disease; but my own shall not die like the sons of Adam that are
without. None shall live in this world longer than the time set by me;
and if I so desire, I send a person a second or a third time into this
world or into some other by the transmigration of souls.
