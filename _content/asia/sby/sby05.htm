<p>Before all creation this revelation was with Melek &#7788;&acirc;&#146;&ucirc;s, who sent &#145;Abd &#7788;&acirc;&#146;&ucirc;s to this world that he might separate truth known to his particular people.</p>  
<p>This was done, first of all, by means of oral tradition, and afterward by means of this book, Al-Jilwah, which the outsiders may neither read nor behold.</p>
