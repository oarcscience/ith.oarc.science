### VI

### THE LANGUAGE

The language of the Yezidis, in common with the Kurds, is Kurdish, which
belongs to the Iranian group of the Indo-European or Indo-Germanic
stock. This Kurmanji possesses a number of dialects not differing much
from one another, except the zaza dialect, which is spoken in eastern
Mesopotamia by the Kurds, called Ali Alla. The main characteristic of
the Kurmangi are the great brevity of its words and the simplicity of
its grammatical forms. It is fairly rich in vowels, and richer in deep
gutteral sounds. Though Kurdish is the general language of the Yezidis,
their religious mysteries are in Arabic. Both languages are spoken by
those living in the Sinjar hills and in Šeiḫan.
