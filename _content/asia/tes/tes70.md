### 5. A MARKOVA TALE.

There was a duck who called \_herself White-Cap. She asked her
granddaughter to louse her. "O granny! there are no lice on your
forehead, but plenty on the back of your head."--"Géte, géte!" said the
old woman in duck language. "There are none on the back of the head, but
quite a good many on the forehead, géte, géte, géte!"--"O granny! Why do
you talk like that? You never did so before. Géte, géte, I always talked
like the gray geese that pass high above me. They made me lose my wits,
géte, géte, géte!" The girl was frightened and ran away.

For some time she remained alone, then she felt lonely and sat down on a
high stone. A snow-bunting perched on a cranberry-bush. The girl asked
it, "What do you want?"--"Pitititi do you feel warm?"--"I do feel
warm."--"Pitititi, why do you not bathe in the river?"--"I am afraid,
lest I should drown."--"Pitititi, why do you not hold on to a
willow."--"I am afraid to get a splinter in my palm."--"Pitititi, why do
you not put on mittens?"--"I am afraid, lest they should be
torn."--"Pitititi, why do you not mend them?"--"I am afraid the needle
might break."--"Pitititi, why do you not sharpen it?" "I am afraid the
whetstone might split, and brother would blame me."

"What is your bed?"--"A dogskin."--"What is your pillow?"--"A dog's
neck."--"What are your spoons?"--"Dog's paws."--"What are your
forks?"--"Dog's claws."--"What is your kettle?"--"A dog skull."--"What
is your sledge?"--"Dog's cheek-bones."--"What are your ladles?"--"Dog's
shoulder blades."--"What are your titbits?"--"Dog's tongue."--"What are
your cups?"--"Dog's teeth."--"And where is your fire?"--"A jay passed by
and extinguished it."--"And

where is the jay?"--"It flew away to the mountain to peck at the larch
gum." The end.

Told by Mary Alin, a Russianized Chuvantzi woman, in the village of
Markova. Recorded by Mrs. Sophie Bogoras, winter of 1900.
