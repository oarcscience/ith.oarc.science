# VI. ANADYR TALES.

### 10. A CHUVANTZI TALE <span id="fr_111"></span>[1](#fn_111) (*Anadyr Version*).

There was a man, Látka by name, who had an assistant who was called
PóndandI. When Látka died, his daughter remained alone with PóndandI.
PóndandI worked for her as he used to do for her father. One morning she
arose and saw that there was no fire in the house. She walked out, and
saw the assistant sitting on the other bank of the river, quite
motionless. "Eh, PóndandI, PóndandI, why do you not make a fire? We are
cold." He said nothing, but sat as before, looking at her quite
steadfastly. So she made the fire herself. "Here, PóndandI, fetch some
water!" He did not stir. She went for water herself. "Here, PóndandI,
cook some food! We are hungry." He paid no attention. She cooked the
brisket of a wild sheep. "O, PóndandI, PóndandI! what do you want?" He
did not answer. "Come and have a meal!" He did not stir. She ate all
alone, and went to sleep. The next morning she went out of the house. He
was sitting on the very same place, looking at her more steadfastly than
ever. She herself performed all the household work, and said nothing to
him. When all was finished, she called, "Ah, PóndandI, PóndandI! what do
you want?" He did not reply. "Perhaps you want a handsome suit of
clothes. I will prepare them for you." He sat as before without
answering, looking steadfastly at her.

She had a meal and went to sleep. The next morning she looked at the
river, and he was sitting there as before. "O PóndandI, PóndandI I what
do you want? Perhaps you want to take me for your wife?" He jumped up
like a football, and danced about. After one tour he sat down again, and
looked at her as steadfastly as before. She said nothing until the next
morning. Then she went to the river, and said:--

"O PóndandI, PóndandI!  
If you want to marry me,  
Go and kill a big brown bear  
For a blanket for me."

He jumped up and danced about, and then started off like an arrow. She
said to herself, "Oh, let him go! Perhaps the bear will devour him, and
I shall be rid of him." The next morning she went to the river, and
PóndandI, was sitting there as before. "Ah!" thought she, "he is still
alive." But when she came back to her house, a big bear's carcass was
lying near the entrance.

"O, PóndandI, PóndandI!  
Go and kill a big elk  
For trimming my dress."

\[paragraph continues\] He jumped up again and danced off. In due time
she went to sleep, saying to herself, "No he is surely dead." She arose
in the morning and went to the river. PóndandI was sitting there, but a
big elk's carcass lay near the entrance.

"O PóndandI, PóndandI!  
If you want to marry me,  
Go and kill a big mountain-sheep  
For our wedding roast."

\[paragraph continues\] He jumped up and danced off. She said to
herself, "Now perhaps he will fall down the cliff and be killed." The
next morning she went to the river. PóndandI was sitting there, and a
big mountain-sheep carcass was lying near the door.

"O PóndandI, PóndandI!  
See there the big stone!  
Go and bring it here  
For our future children to play with."

\[paragraph continues\] He jumped up and danced off, "Ah," said she,
"now the end is coming. The stone is too heavy. He will desist from his
marriage projects."

The next morning she went out of the house; and a big mountain which had
stood away back from the river had changed its place, and stood before
the entrance.

"O PóndandI, PóndandI!  
If you want to marry me,  
Take a bow with arrows  
And shoot an arrow up to the sky,  
Then you must follow it,  
As swift as your arrow."

\[paragraph continues\] He jumped off and caught his bow. He strung it
and shot an arrow up to heaven. Then he jumped upward and followed the
arrow. She looked up and followed him with her eyes, until he was lost
out of sight. She waited and waited, but he did not fall back, and never
descended. "Ah," said she, cc surely he fell down at some other place.
No doubt he is dead." She went

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

to sleep, and in the morning she went again to the river. Nobody was
there. "Ah!" sighed she," it is allover," and went back to the house. At
that moment, however, a man came driving a team of reindeer. It was
PóndandI. He tell down somewhere among a big herd of reindeer: so he
caught a pair of reindeer, and after attaching them to a sledge, he
drove off. Now he arose from his sledge. He was quite handsome, and his
clothes were fine. He entered the house and sat down on the bed of the
girl.

"O you visitor! Do not sit down on my place! My bridegroom will come,
And he will blame me."

"I am your husband," said PóndandI. "No," said the girl, "you are not.
His coat is of the worst kind of skins, and he himself is no more than a
snotty youth."--"If you do not believe me, come out, and I will prove it
to you." They went out, and he showed her his former clothes and the
skin of a snotty youth in the tree. "Look there!" said PóndandI, "down
the valley. My father and mother are passing there with a few of their
herds." She looked down, and the whole valley was alive with
reindeer,--bucks and deer, and small fawns. The old people came nearer,
and their herd proved much more numerous than the herd of the girl. They
joined their herds and lived there. Látka's daughter married PóndandI.
The end.

Told by Anne Chain, a Russianized Chuvantzi woman, in the village of
Markova, the Anadyr country, summer of 1896.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_111"></span>[136:1](tes75.htm#fr_111) This tale is probably
of Chuvantzi provenience. It is remarkable from the fact that some
fragments of verse have been arranged in the form of an old Russian lay,
although the life it describes is of native color. in the Kolyma country
this tale has been transformed into a similar lay, more coherent in
character, used chiefly as a lullaby. See No. 11, [p.
138](#page_138).--W. B.
