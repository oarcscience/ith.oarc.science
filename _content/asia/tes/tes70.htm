<P>There was a duck who called _herself White-Cap. She asked her granddaughter to louse her. "O granny! there are no lice on your forehead, but plenty on the back of your head."--"G&eacute;te, g&eacute;te!" said the old woman in duck language. "There are none on the back of the head, but quite a good many on the forehead, g&eacute;te, g&eacute;te, g&eacute;te!"--"O granny! Why do you talk like that? You never did so before. G&eacute;te, g&eacute;te, I always talked like the gray geese that pass high above me. They made me lose my wits, g&eacute;te, g&eacute;te, g&eacute;te!" The girl was frightened and ran away.</P>

The girl asked it, "What do you want?"--"Pitititi do you feel warm?"--"I do feel warm."--"Pitititi, why do you not bathe in the river?"--"I am afraid, lest I should drown."--"Pitititi, why do you not hold on to a willow."--"I am afraid to get a splinter in my palm."--"Pitititi, why do you not put on mittens?"--"I am afraid, lest they should be torn."--"Pitititi, why do you not mend them?"--"I am afraid the needle might break."--"Pitititi, why do you not sharpen it?" "I am afraid the whetstone might split, and brother would blame me."</P>
<P>"What is your bed?"--"A dogskin."--"What is your pillow?"--"A dog's neck."--"What are your spoons?"--"Dog's paws."--"What are your forks?"--"Dog's claws."--"What is your kettle?"--"A dog skull."--"What is your sledge?"--"Dog's cheek-bones."--"What are your ladles?"--"Dog's shoulder blades."--"What are your titbits?"--"Dog's tongue."--"What are your cups?"--"Dog's teeth."--"And where is your fire?"--"A jay passed by and extinguished it."--"And</P>

<P>where is the jay?"--"It flew away to the mountain to peck at the larch gum." The end.</P>
<P>Told by Mary Alin, a Russianized Chuvantzi woman, in the village of Markova. Recorded by Mrs. Sophie Bogoras, winter of 1900.</P>
