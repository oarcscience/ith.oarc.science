### 6. (WOLVES AND MEN.)

There lived some people who had no dogs at all, so they caught the small
puppies of a gray fox, and brought them up. These gray foxes brought
forth black and spotted dogs. Another man caught a wolfling and fed it.
That wolf brought forth another kind of dog. They were long-legged, and
light in color. This wolf was so nimble of foot, that it could overtake
and catch reindeer and elk and any other kind of game. So its master
became the richest of all the people.

At last the man said, "I am quite rich. My assistants are too many." So
he ceased to pay the, wolf in food and shelter. The wolf went off and
called all his companions. Twenty wolves came with him, and attacked the
reindeer herd. Many reindeer were killed. The man caught his bow, shot
at the wolves, and killed four of them. From that time began the war
between man and wolf. The end.

Told by Ulashkan, a Lamut man, on the Molonda River, in the Kolyma
country, summer of 1895.
