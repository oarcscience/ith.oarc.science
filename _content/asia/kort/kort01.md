# NOTE.

The present volume was intended to include a collection of Kamchadal
texts. Owing to the war, it has been impossible to communicate with Mr.
Bogoras; and since the volume has been in type for over two years, it
seems best to publish the collection of Koryak texts alone.

There is some inconsistency in spelling the verbal endings -*lin* and
-*łen*. These ought to be read consistently as given here. The forms
-*łin* and -*len* are incorrect. There is no *g* in Koryak. Wherever
this occurs, it should be read *ġ*.

EDITOR.

November, 1916.
