<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>Dig-Raven lived with his people. Oh, Eme'mqut walked along the seashore, and found some shellfish. He detached one shellfish, and it began to whimper, "I&#289;i&#289;i'!" He said, "Cease your crying! Yonder among the stone-pine bushes (lies) your detached hood."</P>
<P>Oh, he went and looked for it! It had turned into a small house. He entered the house and married that Shellfish-Girl. Then he brought her home. They lived there. That is all.</P>
