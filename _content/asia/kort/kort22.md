# 18. The Kamak and his Wife. <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39)

Some people lived in a certain place. One day a kamak and his wife
looked down (through the entrance-hole). They said, "Halloo! have you
not some blubber?"--"There is some in the cache." They entered the
cache, and began to eat blubber. Then they sang, "It tastes well. We are
eating blubber." <span id="fr_40"></span>[2](#fn_40) The next morning it
was the same. "Halloo! have you not some blubber?"--"There is some in
the porch."--"It tastes well. We are eating blubber; but when you have
no more blubber, \[to-morrow\] we shall eat you."

They fled upwards in the night-time. They threw an arrow (upwards), and
it became a road. They fled along this road.

Those came again. "Halloo! have you not some blubber?" But there was no
answer. "Let us jump in! They are hidden somewhere." They entered, and
searched in all the corners. There was nothing.

They said, "Let us try the divining-stone!" <span

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span> <span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

kamak-woman) made (her husband) stand with his legs apart. She used his
penis as a divining-stone. "If they have fled to the morning dawn, we
shall follow them. If they have fled to the sunset, we shall follow
them. To the seaside also we shall follow them. If they have fled
upwards, what then? God would not treat us very pleasantly. How can we
follow them?"

He began to sway his penis. "Shall we go out through the same opening
without any fear. <span id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42) Let us go out
through the vent-hole in the roof of the porch!" The kamak-woman said,
"Take me on your shoulders!" He took her on his back. "Oh, you are
strangling me!" (His head) thrust itself into her anus. "Oh, you are
playing mischief!"

Finally they both died, and lay there. His head slipped into her anus.
After a while (the fugitives) said, "Let us visit the house!" They
visited it, and dragged out his head with an iron hook, and his head had
become (quite) hairless.

"Oh, oh?" They threw them into the direction of the sunset. Then they
lived and were happy. They were not (molested) by spirits. That is all.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_39"></span>[81:1](kort22.htm#fr_39) <span id="page_80">p.
80</span> Compare Jochelson, The Koryak, *l. c.*, No. 105, p. 293.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[81:2](kort22.htm#fr_40) Compare [p.
68](kort17.htm#page_68), footnote 3.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[81:3](kort22.htm#fr_41) Literally "let us act
with the grandmother". The word "grandmother" is used also for
"divining-stone" (Cf. W. Jochelson, The Koryak, *l. c.*, p. 44). <span
id="page_81">p. 81</span> The reason is probably that divination with
stones is chiefly practised by women, and that the divining-stone,
though usually a round pebble or a piece of bone ornamented with beads
and tassels, represents a female guardian of the family.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[83:1](kort22.htm#fr_42) Literally, "without
shame". "Shame" for "fear" is used also in the Chukchee (Publications of
the Jesup North Pacific Expedition, vol. viii, No. 10, p. 61 footnote 1.
