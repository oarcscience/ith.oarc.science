# 22. Eme'mqut and Envious-One. <span id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52)

The next morning Eme'mqut saw Envious-One, and he said -to him, "Where
did you see him? Let us go and visit him." Again they visited him, and
said t o him. "Oh, wait! we are going to roast the omasum on a flat
stone." Then Eme'mqut left Envious-One.

He began to busy himself with the omasum, and to roast it. He finished
this. Then he went away. After some time he took a fine girl for a wife.
Envious-One brought to his home his former (wife) Little U'weñ. After a
long time they said to each other. "Come here! Let us compare the beauty
of our wives!"

Envious-One said, "All right! I will bring her." After that every time
again he rushes at his wife. She had an overcoat fringed with
reindeer-mane. He took her along. While on the way, he washed her quite
frequently with (liquid from) the chamber-vessel, and (by rubbing)
forced the blood into her face.

Then those two came. Eme'mqut's wife was hidden. They were going to
bring the wives. Envious-One fed his wife sumptuously, giving her plenty
of whale-blubber. "Let us compare the beauty of our wives!"

They brought them in. "Ah, but she has long lashes! She has large
buttocks!" All the time he kept jumping over to his wife and
re-arranging the parting of her hair. "Oh, surely she will came out the
victor!" Then they brought forth Eme'mqut's wife. Envious-One swooned at
the first look.

He had a diarrhea from that whale-blubber. <span

recovered his senses. He said, "I have slept." And really he began to
eat

again the matter vomited from his insides. They brought in the woman
again. He swooned.

That vomited matter, which he tried to swallow came out again. They took
her away. He recovered his senses, and ate again that matter vomited
from his insides. Then (he said), "I do not want it. Go away! I have had
enough!" The end.

a larger tale, but the narrator knew no more.
