# 15. Eme'mqut and the Perches. <span id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34)

Eme'mqut went into the open and found a village. They were catching
winter fish with drag-nets. The fish were small perches. He dragged a
net along that fishing-river, and filled with fish a set of
drying-poles. He made such a set. Very quickly he constructed those
drying-poles.

After a while they gave him Fox-Woman, and made him marry her. He
brought home two small dried perch-tails. These he brought home, and
hung them on the drying-pole.

They were going to eat these small dried perch-tails, and all at once
something happened. (These small tails) turned into small men. They
said, "Whose sons are we?"--"Say, 'We are sons of Eme'mqut.'"

Then the (two) girls of this place filled with dried meat two bags; one
for each \[they filled\]. They went away in iron canoes, and took the
girls along. What has become of them I do not know. They went together,
(both of them), headlong.

Those (*i. e.*, Eme'mqut and his wife) were sent away by the people, and
were given (reindeer with) halters of grass. Then the people ceased to
send them away. They ceased to send away Eme'mqut and his wife. They
became as natives, and lived in joy. Fox-Woman now was bringing forth
mere male children.

Winter came, they were wandering in all directions. At times they
visited their neighbors. That is all.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_34"></span>[71:1](kort19.htm#fr_34) *Acerina cernua*. This
tale was told by a young girl. It seems to be a fragment of a longer and
more coherent tale.
