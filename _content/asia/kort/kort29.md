### Footnotes

<span id="fn_56"></span>[103:1](kort29.htm#fr_56) These two songs were
written down from the phonographic records of Mr. Jochelson (No. 2 and
No. 7 on his list). The first is in Koryak of Kamenskoye', the second is
Chukchee in grammar and phonetics, and Koryak in vocabulary. It was
obtained from an old Reindeer Chukchee of Parapolski Dol, who had lived
for a long time among the Reindeer Koryak.
