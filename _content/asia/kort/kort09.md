# 5. Big-Raven and the Kamaks.

Raven-Big said, "I will slide down hill." \[He slid down hill.\] He went
and found a mountain, which was the largest of all. From that mountain
he slid down, and rolled into the porch of the house of the kamaks <span

the porch, and said, "Oh, human game has come to us of its own free
will!"--"I am not human game, I am a man." They took him into the house,
and began to eat his body joint by joint. Still he was alive. They
consumed Big-Raven. Then he carne home, because he was a shaman.

He recovered his senses, and said to his wife, "Cook

some soup for me!" She cooked some soup, and he ate all alone a large
kettleful. Then he said to Miti', "Bring the big hammer! <span
id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19)" She gave him the hammer, and he swallowed
it. He arrived at to the house of some kamaks, and vomited through the
vent-hole. (He filled the whole house) and made them climb upward. The
big kamak was standing in the middle of the house. Big-Raven struck him
with the hammer. He killed him. Big-Raven came home. That is all.
