# 21. Big-Raven and Fox. <span id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48)

Big-Raven walked along the sand-spit, and found a small ringed-seal. He
said, "It seems that if it were a good catch, it would not lie so far
(from the water)." He kicked it, and threw it into the sea. He walked
farther on, and found a spotted seal. He said as before, "It seems that
if it were a good catch, it would not lie so far (from the water)." He
kicked it into the sea.

Then he found a thong-seal, and kicked it into the sea. He found a
white-whale, and threw it into the water. He found a whale, and another
whale, quite big (bowhead whale), and he threw it in still farther. He
walked on, and found a striped whale. (Then he said,) "Here is a good
whale!"

Then he called aloud to the neighboring people. A number of Chukchee
rushed for the whale, knife in hand. They were approaching. He looked on
them and felt frightened. So he entered the mouth of the whale. There he
began to suck in the whale-oil. He filled his mouth full, then he jumped
out and flew away.

A fox <span id="fr_49"></span>[2](#fn_49) saw him. "Where do you come
from?"--"From the whale." She says, "What?" He says, "From the whale."
She said again, "What?"--"From the whale!" <span
id="fr_50"></span>[3](#fn_50) Then the oil dropped down directly on her
(back).

"That is good. I gathered some oil." She wrung out her coat in a
dogs'trough. Big-Raven also gathered oil (for himself). Then the small
fox prepared a cake of (berries and other) vegetable material, and sent
it to Big-Raven to show her gratitude. With these return-payments,
however, she killed him. <span id="fr_51"></span>[4](#fn_51) It is
finished.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[91:2](kort25.htm#fr_49) The fox, in the Koryak
and Chukchee, is usually a female, Fox-Woman.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[91:3](kort25.htm#fr_50) <span id="page_91">p.

closed; the third, with mouth open. They are also imitative of the cry
of the raven.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[91:4](kort25.htm#fr_51) Evidently by poison
mixed with the berries.
