<P>
This is a short extract from a book by a Christian missionary which
gives some historical observations on the Yezidi people of northern
Iraq.
For more information on the Yezidi, refer to
<A HREF="../sby/index">Devil Worship:
The Sacred Books and Traditions of the Yezidiz</A>, which references
this article heavily.

<P>
The Rev. Badger didn't get as close to the Yezidi as Isya Joseph did.
His access was limited because he was a missionary,
rather than an anthropologist.
However, there aren't too many first-hand accounts of the Yezidi during the
mid-nineteenth century, (actually this is the only one I've discovered so far).
This document gives another perspective on this fascinating culture
and their unique religious beliefs.
