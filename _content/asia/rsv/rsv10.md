### VII. ROMAN CATHOLICISM IN SOUTH VIETNAM

As religious beliefs must be understood before one can appreciate social
customs, behavior patterns, value systems, taboos, etc., a brief study
of Roman Catholicism in Vietnam is relevant. This is especially true in
view of the fact that Roman Catholicism is the oldest form of
Christianity in Vietnam. As a factor in Vietnamese history for several
centuries, it has been and now is a religious force which requires the
attention of those who seek to understand the internal situation.

The Roman Catholic Church stated that, as of the end of 1965, 10.5%
(approximately 1,600,000) of all the South Vietnamese Republic's present
population are members. Therefore, the Church, influencing its people by
leadership in moral, ethical, spiritual, and educational realms,
constitutes a force which must be considered in the political, military,
social, and economic decisions of an awakening nation. In 1966 the Roman
Catholic Church of South Vietnam had two Archbishops with administrative
offices at Saigon and Hue, and twenty Bishops who oversaw the pastoral
work of 1,771 priests and the work of 4,026 nuns of the various orders.
Across the 17th Parallel, the Roman Catholic Church has an Archbishop
and an archdiocese at Hanoi, some nine dioceses and thirteen Bishops;
but this study is oriented basically to South Vietnam, except where the
Church's Vietnamese history requires inclusion of the north since the
church early established in Tonkin a strong base. The various decrees
affecting Catholicism were issued by the royal rulers dwelling at Hanoi
for most of Roman Catholicism's Vietnamese history.

Spokesmen of the Church point out that the theology of the Church is
universal and therefore no differences exist insofar as mass, etc., are
involved. They also observe that cultural patterns not in conflict with
Church law or theology may be practiced by adherents of the faith. Thus
the ancestor shelf of veneration with minor physical modifications and
emphasis is found in the home of nearly every Vietnamese except for the
animistic tribespeople and the Protestants.

The comparatively strong educational program of the Church tends to
place many of its graduates near the top of economic, cultural,
political and academic areas of Vietnamese life except where the
dynamics of religious forces gravitate against them. As governmental
educational institutions develop and assume a molding influence, the
effect of Church-oriented education will not be so obvious, which may
lessen the tension which currently seems to exist in varying degrees
throughout South Vietnam.

The Church's figures of 101,010 catechists, 189,930 baptisms and 19,293
marriages for 1963 is considered about normal according to one
Vietnamese Roman Catholic Bishop. Yet the course of the war and
political strife undoubtedly has an effect upon the Church even as it
does upon the individual Vietnamese throughout Vietnam. While the death
rate or apostasy figures have not been included, they are involved in
computation of Church growth according to hierarchy spokesmen.

years, but this review covers the major Church events to give the
setting and understanding of various historical forces so that the
current struggles can be better understood and evaluated.

<u>ROMAN CATHOLIC DIOCESES IN NORTH VIETNAM</u>

Because the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy of Vietnam includes North
Vietnam insofar as the Roman Catholic Church is concerned, the
population of the dioceses of North Vietnam is included with the
percentage of Roman Catholic members.
