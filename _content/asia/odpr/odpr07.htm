<p><i>Number and Distribution:</i>&#151;With the present numerical strength of the Druzes, their geographical distribution in southern Lebanon, W&#257;di-al-Taym, al Jabal al-A&#145;la (between Aleppo and Antioch), &#7778;afad and Mt. Carmel in Palestine, and with their later migrations which determined their present habitat, we are more or less familiar. According to the last census there are about 110,000 Druzes in Lebanon and Syria, and 7,000 in Palestine. The present Druze population of &#7716;awr&#257;n (44,344) are, according to well authenticated documents and local oral tradition,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the descendants of emigrants from south Lebanon who, in 1711, as a result of the defeat of their Yemenite party by its Qaysite enemy, left their home, Kafra,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and sought a new abode. The number was later augmented by fresh recruits&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> as a result of the 1860 civil war in the Lebanon. Earlier the Jabal al-Ala Druzes emigrated thither from the south.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Those of Palestine are of undoubted Lebanese origin, though some of them may have come directly from the Aleppo region.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Lebanon therefore was the distributing center of the Druze people and W&#257;di-al-Taym was the birthplace of their religion.</p>

<p>It is also easy to trace the ancestry of the modern Druze emigrants in Europe and America back to Syria and the Lebanon. In the United States there are about a thousand Druzes, mostly of Lebanese origin, among whom eighty are women.</p>  
<p>The few Druze manuscripts which have thus far fallen into our hands represent the F&#257;&#7789;imite &#7716;ak&#299;m cult as having spread into many lands outside the confines of Syria, and as having found proselytes throughout northern Africa, Egypt, Arabia, &#145;Ir&#257;q, Persia and other parts of the Near East, into which &#7716;amzah had sent missionaries of different grades. That this was not an altogether idle boast is illustrated by a reference in al-Dhahabi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (&#134; 1345 A.D.) to the execution of all those in far-away Khur&#257;s&#257;n who believed in the divinity of al-&#7716;ak&#299;m. Following the example, legendary or historical, of the Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad, al-Muqtana Bah&#257;&#146;-al-D&#299;n, the right hand of &#7716;amzah in the propagation of the cult, addressed epistles eastward as far as India and westward as far as Constantinople, including one to Constantine VIII&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and one to Emperor Michael the Paphlagonian.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> But the fact remains that of those &#7716;ak&#299;m followers, none has survived except the Druzes of the Lebanon.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> In Egypt they were exterminated soon after the appearance of the cult. No matter where the modern Druze, therefore, may be today, he can rightly trace his origin back to that mountain land of Lebanon.</p>  
<p><i>Religious and Racial Boundaries Coterminous:</i>&#151;This is especially true in view of the fact that with the death of Bah&#257;&#146;-al-D&#299;n in 1031 A.D. "the door of the Unitarian religion was closed"</p>

<p>and no one could be admitted into the Druze fold or permitted exit from it. The Druze religion then ceased to be simply a religion and its followers became a distinct nation. Bah&#257;&#146;-al-Din resorted to this policy as a measure of safety. New pretended converts might betray the cause into the hands of its persecutors. He considered "the day of grace," offered to an unworthy world by the divine al-&#7716;&#257;kim and the transcendent &#7716;amzah, as having passed forever. To a religious body thus reduced to the defensive and desperately striving to conceal its identity, if not its very existence, further proselytism became clearly impossible. The Druze religion thus became wholly hereditary, a sacred privilege, a priceless treasure to be jealously and zealously guarded against the profane. This self-centralization which makes its votaries shun all attempts at increasing their number, coupled with the inviolable secrecy with which they practice their religion, and the readiness with which they ever hold themselves to profess any dominant religion that happens to throw its shadow across their way, has enabled the Druze community to maintain a stable and homogeneous existence for upward of nine centuries. In this it may have had no parallel in the religious history of the world.</p>  
<p><i>Silence of Historians:</i>&#151;The first historian to mention the rise and spread of the Druze religion was Ya&#7717;ya ibn-Sa&#145;&#299;d al-An&#7789;&#257;ki,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> a Christian contemporary of Darazi,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the founder of the religion. In his account he was followed by another Christian historian, Jurjus al-Mak&#299;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (&#134; 1273 A.D.). But both historians are silent on</p>

<p>the question of racial origins. Other Arabic sources, written by Moslems, such as ibn-al-Ath&#299;r&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (&#134; 1234), abu-al-Fida&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_20"></A><A HREF="#fn_20"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (&#134; 1331), ibn-Taghri-Birdi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (&#134; 1469) and later Syrian and Egyptian chroniclers like ibn-Khald&#363;n (&#134; 1406), al-Suy&#363;&#7789;i (&#134; 1505), al-Is&#7717;&#257;qi (&#134; cir. 1650) are equally silent. To these annalists, questions of religious, and not racial, grouping were the ones of paramount and all-absorbing interest.</p>  
<p>The Crusading historians of the West and the reports of the pilgrims likewise throw no light on the subject. To them all non-Christian peoples of Syria were included under the generic name "<i>Sarraceni</i>." The pilgrims ordinarily took the coastal route and were therefore not likely to come much in contact with the Druzes. But the Druzes undoubtedly took part in the struggle against the Crusaders and possibly influenced the Templars by their organization and teaching.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>Travelers&#146; and Scholars&#146; Accounts:</i>&#151;Travelers and modern writers have almost exhausted all the list of possible theories in their attempt to explain the racial beginnings of the Druze people. Some have even resorted to fantastic and na&iuml;ve, if not ludicrous, hypotheses.</p>  
<p>Benjamin of Tudela, the Jewish traveler who passed through the Lebanon in or about 1165 was one of the first European writers to refer to the Druzes by name. The word Druzes, in an early Hebrew edition of his travels, occurs as "<i>Dogziyin</i>,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> but it is clear that this is a scribal error. According to the <i>Encyclopaedia</i>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_14"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 14</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>of Islam</i>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Benjamin also states that the Druzes were descended from the Ituraeans (an Aramean or Arabian tribe which Pompey found in Lebanon in 64 B.C.), but I have not been able to find this statement in any version of Benjamin's Itinerary.</p>  
<p><i>Criticism of the Arabian Theory:</i>&#151;Modern travelers like Niebuhr,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and scholars like von Oppenheim,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#fn_26"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> undoubtedly echoing the popular Druze belief regarding their own origin, have classified them as Arabs. The prevailing idea among the Druzes themselves today is that they are of Arab stock. This hypothesis conforms to the general local tradition, but is in contradiction to the results obtained in this study. In his Huxley Memorial Lecture, "The Early Inhabitants of Western Asia," Professor Felix von Luschan, the famous anthropologist of the University of Berlin, states that he measured the skulls of fifty-nine adult male Druzes and "not one single man fell, as regards his cephalic index, within the range of the real Arab."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_27"></A><A HREF="#fn_27"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Evidently the Druze claim of Arab descent is the result of their application of the principle of dissimulation (<i>taqiyyah</i>) to their racial problem, they being a small minority amidst an Arab majority which has always been in the ascendancy. According to this principle, one is not only ethically justified but is under obligation, when the exigencies of the case require, to conceal the reality of his religion, or race, and feign other religious or racial relationships.</p>  
<p>The writer remembers hearing Druzes in Lebanon discussing Japanese victories during the Russo-Japanese War of 1906 and claiming common origin with the yellow Far Easterners. Miss Bell who was then traveling in &#7716;awr&#257;n (Jabal al-Dur&#363;z) observed that the "Druzes believe the Japanese to belong to their own race."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>

<p><i>Diverse Hypotheses:</i>&#151;Lamartine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> discovered in the modern Druzes the remnants of the Samaritans; the Earl of Carnarvon,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> those of the Cuthites&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> whom Esarhaddon transplanted into Palestine; George Washington Chasseaud,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> those of the Hivites; and Mrs. Worsley,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> those of the Hittites. Drawing his conclusions from anthropometric measurements, Professor Luschan makes the Druzes, Maronites, and Nu&#7779;ayriyyah of Syria&#151;together with the Armenians, &#7788;aht&#257;jis, Bekt&#257;shis, &#145;Ali-Il&#257;his and Yez&#299;dis of Asia Minor and Persia&#151;"with their enormous high and short heads and narrow and high noses"&#151;the modern representatives of the ancient Hittites.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> Captain Light describes them on the authority of Pococke "as the remnant of Israel who fled the wrath of Moses after the destruction of the molten calf."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> Canon Parfit, who lived several years among the Druzes, states in a recent book that they are "the descendants of Arabs, Persians, Hindoos, Jews and Christians."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>Supposed Relationship with the French and British and with Freemasonry:</i>&#151;Deceived by superficial and purely accidental phonetic resemblances, certain French scholars once accepted the curious hypothesis, which in the seventeenth century found vogue in Europe, to the effect that the modern Druzes of the Lebanon are the descendants of a Latin colony which owed its origin to a comte de Dreux who, subsequent to the fall of Acre, led his Crusading regiment to the out-of-the-way hills of Lebanon.

<p>same myth makes the Druze chief Fakhr-al-D&#299;n a scion of the house of Lorraine through Godfrey of Bouillon.</p>  
<p>This genealogy was apparently fabricated in connection with the visit of that prince Fakhr-al-D&#299;n to Italy, after he had made an alliance in 1608 with Ferdinand I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, with a view to arousing a crusade against Fakhr-al-D&#299;n's enemy suzerains, the Turks. In 1763 Puget de Saint-Pierre wrote a book entitled <i>Histoire des Druses, Peuple du Liban, form&eacute; par une colonie de Fran&ccedil;ois</i> (Paris). Articles appeared in learned magazines&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> supporting the idea. More discriminating writers like Volney,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Lamartine,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Dussaud,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_40"></A><A HREF="#fn_40"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> were quick to detect the historic impossibility of the hypothesis. English travelers like Maundrell&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_41"></A><A HREF="#fn_41"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and Pococke&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_42"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> seem to have accepted the theory of Druze descent from the remains of some Christian army of Crusading origin.</p>  
<p>It was evidently in an analogous sphere of ideas that such lodges as those of "<i>Druzes R&eacute;unis</i>" and "<i>Commandeurs du Liban</i>" were founded in France.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></p>  
<p>By the same processes of reasoning the Druze name was connected with those of the Druids, and many Freemason lodges have claimed relationship with the Druzes whose "ancestors were none other than the original subjects of King Hiram of Tyre, the builders of Solomon's temple."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_44"></A><A HREF="#fn_44"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The writer remembers more than one occasion on which prominent contemporaneous Druzes claimed common descent for their people with the British. That this claim goes back to the</p>

<p>early part of the eighteenth century is shown by a reference in Pococke's <i>Description</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#fn_45"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> English agents in Syria, anxious for a "zone of influence" among the Druzes to counteract the French zone among the Maronites, may have acquiesced in the Druze claim to blood relationship with the British.</p>  
<p><i>Other Theories:</i>&#151;Some English scholars&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="#fn_46"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of the eighteenth century tried to relate the Druzes to the <i>Derusaiaioi</i> mentioned by Herodotus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_47"></A><A HREF="#fn_47"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> as one of the Median tribes transplanted by Cyrus. In this as in the preceding cases, there seems to be no justification for the theory beyond the apparent similarity in names.</p>  
<p>More worthy of consideration is the statement of Hogarth and Gertrude Bell in the Encyclopaedia Britannica&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="#fn_48"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> that the Druzes are a mixture of stocks in which the Arab largely predominates "grafted on to an original mountain population of Aramaic blood." A study, however, of the Arabic colloquial used by the modern Druzes of Lebanon reveals no such marked Aramaisms as is revealed by a study of the colloquial of their northern neighbors, the Maronites, who are of mixed Aramaic stock; and there is nothing in the sources at our command to justify the inclusion of the Aramaic blood to such an extent in the Druze veins.</p>
