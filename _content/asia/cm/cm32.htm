<P>&#8195;Then you are this woman! You have so much of my husband's love, that he begins to reject me. But you are not a human being. I make you into carrion lying on the pebbly shore, &#8212; old carrion inflated (with rottenness).</P>

<P>&#8195;I make my husband into a (male) bear. The bear comes from a distant land. He has been starving for a long time, he is very hungry. He sees the carrion. Seeing it, he eats of it. After a while he vomits it up. I make you into the stuff vomited. My husband sees it, and it is of no use to him. He rejects it on the mere seeing (of it).</P>

<P>&#8195;At the same time I make this body of mine into a young beaver that has just shed his hair. I make smooth every hair of mine. This woman, object of (my husband's) liking, he leaves her, and desires me, because she is repugnant to look upon.</P>

<P>&#8195;(She spits, and with the saliva smears her whole body from head to foot. Indeed, the husband begins to have liking for her.)</P>

<P>&#8195;I, who was neglected recently, I turn myself towards him, I make myself into a deadly pain for him. Let him be attracted by the smell from here, and have a desire for me. Though I reject him, let him be still more persistent.</P>

<P>&#8195;And really the husband leaves off his former love.</P>
