<P>&#8195;Once a small house stood alone in the wilderness. The ke&acute;let were going to visit it. Only a woman and her children were at home. The man, her

husband was with the herd. On the rear side of the house was a funeral-place,<A NAME="page_52_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_52_note_2"><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></A> and there lay a corpse. One time the woman showed herself to the middle from the sleeping-room,<A NAME="page_52_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_52_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> and saw the dead one. In the evening the woman saw him. "Ah, ah! where are you from?" &#8212; "No. I am your neighbor. I came to see you. Oh, enough! You do not know.

<P>&#8195;They left them. The next day the husband came, and saw the slaughtered dog lying by the entrance. He said, "Oh, good gracious! I left all of my house-mates quite safe, but what may have happened to them? He gave a start and forced an entrance. The woman appeared (from under the cover of the sleeping-room). "Halloo! What is the matter with you?" &#8212; "Nothing. We are all right." Only when in the sleeping-room did she tell him. Ended.</P>
