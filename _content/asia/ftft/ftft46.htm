We went to the bow-maker's and bought three bows, two of which were broken, and the third had no string. <A NAME="img_35801"></A>

<p>In a stream without a drop of water swam three ducks, two of which were dead, while the third hadn't a spark of life. We shot one with an arrow, and taking it in our hand, set off up hill and down dale, drinking coffee and smoking tobacco, gathering tulips and hyacinths, until we had travelled the length of a barleycorn.</p>  
<p>On and on we went, until we came to three houses, two of which were in ruins, while the third had no foundation. There lay three men, two dead and one without life. We asked the dead men to give us a vessel to cook our duck in. They showed us three cupboards, two of which were broken and the third had no sides. In them we found three plates, two full of holes and the third without bottom. In the plate with out bottom we cooked the duck.

<p>At this I went away in anger and came to a tree. Close by was a basket in which some one had put a murdered man. As I looked at him I saw forty thieves approaching; so I took to my heels, they after me. Running till I was out of breath I reached an old tumbledown djami, in the court of which I sat down to rest. The thieves followed and chased me round and round the court, until in my despair I sought to escape them by climbing to the pinnacle of the minaret. One of the thieves drew his knife and came at me, when with a loud shriek I loosed my hold and fell to earth.</p>
