<p><DIR>FAREWELL, thou Sun, and Thou, O Power Divine,<br> That far above my spirit dimly shine.<br> I go to add another star to heaven:--<br> For what are stars, but anguished curses, riven<br> From innocent and hapless souls, that fly<br> To burn the brow of Heaven? and they supply<br> Fresh armaments, and jewels fiery red,<br> To God, the source of lightning flashes dread!</p>  
<p>Alas, what do I say? Send forth thy fires,<br> O God! Consume this brain that thus aspires<br> To soar, and dares to pierce the depths of heaven;<br> And e&#8217;en to climb unto the stars has striven!</p>  
<p>Creator of our trembling beings, hail!<br> Of light and youth, of age when forces fail;<br> Thou that the roses from my brow hast wrenched,<br> Hast stilled my trembling lips, my longings quenched;<br> Mist to mine eyes hast given, sobs to my breath:--<br> Yet thou hast sworn to smile on me in death!<br> Ah, surely thou hast kept for me a life<br> Of fragrance, light, and prayer beyond this strife!<br> But if my latest breath must perish here<br> All silently, in this dark atmosphere--<br> From now a flash of lightning I would be,<br> Coiled round thy name, and, murmuring ceaselessly,<br> A curse I would become to pierce Thy side--<br> God, the Arch Enemy, I would deride!</p>  
<p>Ah me, I tremble, and am pale as death.<br> My brain seethes like a hell; a sobbing breath</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_83"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 83</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>I am amongst the mournful cypress trees,<br> An autumn leaf soon wafted by the breeze!</p>  
<p>Oh, I would live!--give me of life one spark!<br> To dream--and then embrace the grave so dark?<br> My God, how black is this decree of doom<br> Writ in the lees of dread sepulchral gloom!<br> Oh, give my soul one drop of living fire--<br> To love--and live for ever I desire!<br> Ye stars of heaven, into my spirit fall,<br> There live, and hear your hapless lover call!</p>  
<p>To my pale brow the springtime brings no rose.<br> No smile for me in this world's sunbeams glows.<br> Night is my coffin, stars for lights flame round.<br> The moon all weeping seeks my funeral mound.<br> There are some men for whom no mourners sigh--<br> It was for them He placed that moon on high;<br> And he that to death's portals draweth near<br> First life would have--and then a mourner's tear.</p>  
<p>In vain the stars of heaven spelt "Love" for me<br> And nightingales explained its mystery.<br> In vain of Love I learnt to know the truth,<br> And crystal waves reflected back my youth.<br> In vain the forest silent lay around--<br> The secret leaves gave forth no breath or sound;<br> They would not break upon my reverie--<br> They let me dream of Love eternally.<br> All, all in vain I saw the flowers of spring<br> Their incense to my dreams' fair altar bring;<br> With their delights they all have mocked at me--<br> And all the world is but God's mockery!</DIR></p>
