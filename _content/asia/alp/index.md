This is a collection of translations of Armenian literature from the
middle ages, interspersed with poetry from the 19th century. In
addition, there are a number of episodes from the chronicles of Moses of
Khorene, a fifth century Armenian historian. These recount legendary
incidents of ancient Armenian history. The anthologist and translator of
many of these poems, Zabelle Boyajian, also created the luminous
illustrations.

The book concludes with a long essay by Aram Raffi which contextualizes
the long history of Armenian literature. This essay also details the
long religious history of Armenia, starting with an extended discussion
of the ancient Pagan deities. Armenia is in a region which is a
cross-roads between Asia and Europe, and has more often than not been
conquered by the dominant regional power of the day, starting with the
Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Macedonians, through the Ottomans and
finally the Russians.

Nevertheless, Armenia has managed to hold onto a unique cultural and
linguistic identity. Armenians have produced a substantial national
literature, particularly in those short windows of time while not under
foreign domination. Unfortunately, not much of this has been translated
into English. This anthology is one of the few sources we have in the
public domain. So please enjoy this little sampler of Armenian
literature.
