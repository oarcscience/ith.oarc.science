### MY DEATH

##### BY BEDROS TOUR IAN

WHEN Death's pale angel comes to me,  
And smiling sweetly on my head,  
Bids all my pains and sorrows fleet,--  
Believe not then that I am dead.

When my cold limbs they shroud with care,  
And on my brow love's tear-drops shed,  
And lay me on my ebon bier,--  
Believe not then that I am dead.

And when the tolling bell shall ring  
To my black coffin's muted tread  
--Death's fiendish laughter, quivering,--  
Believe not then that I am dead.

And when the black-robed priests shall sing,  
And prayers and incense round me spread,  
With faces dark and sorrowing--  
Believe not still that I am dead.

When on my tomb they heap the clay,  
And leave me in my lonely bed,  
And loved ones turn with sobs away--  
Then never think that I am dead.

But if my grave neglected lie,  
My memory too be gone and fled,  
And dear ones pass unheeding by,  
Ah, then believe that I am dead!
