### THE LITTLE LAKE <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3)

##### BY BEDROS TOURIAN

(1852-1872)

WHY dost thou lie in hushed surprise,  
    Thou little lonely mere?  
Did some fair woman wistfully  
    Gaze in thy mirror clear?

Or are thy waters calm and still  
    Admiring the blue sky,  
Where shining cloudlets, like thy foam,  
    Are drifting softly by?

Sad little lake, let us be friends!  
    I too am desolate;  
I too would fain, beneath the sky,  
    In silence meditate.

As many thoughts are in my mind  
    As wavelets o’er thee roam;  
As many wounds are in my heart  
    As thou hast flakes of foam.

But if heaven's constellations all  
    Should drop into thy breast,  
Thou still wouldst not be like my soul,--  
    A flame-sea without rest.

There, when the air and thou are calm;  
    The clouds let fall no showers;  
The stars that rise there do not set,  
    And fadeless are the flowers.

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

Thou art my queen, O little lake!  
    For e’en when ripples thrill  
Thy surface, in thy quivering depths  
    Thou hold’st me, trembling, still.

Full many have rejected me:  
    "What has he but his lyre?"  
"He trembles, and his face is pale;  
    His life must soon expire!"

None said, "Poor child, why pines he thus?  
    If he beloved should be,  
Haply he might not die, but live,  
    Live, and grow fair to see."

None sought the boy's sad heart to read,  
    Nor in its depths to look.  
They would have found it was a fire,  
    And not a printed book!

Nay, ashes now! a memory!  
    Grow stormy, little mere,  
For a despairing man has gazed  
    Into thy waters clear!
