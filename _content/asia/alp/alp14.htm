<p><DIR><FONT SIZE="-1">"Heaven and earth were in travail,<br> And the crimson waters were in travail.<br> And in the water, the crimson reed<br> Was also in travail.<br> From the mouth of the reed issued smoke,<br> From the mouth of the reed issued flame.<br> And out of the flame sprang the young child.<br> His hair was of fire, a beard had he of flame,<br> And his eyes were suns."</FONT></DIR></p>  
<p>With our own ears did we hear these words sung to the accompaniment of the harp. They sing, moreover, that he did fight with the dragons, and overcame them; and some say that his valiant deeds were like unto those of Hercules. Others declare that he was a god, and that a great image of him stood in the land of Georgia, where it was worshipped with sacrifices.</p>
