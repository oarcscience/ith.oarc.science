<p align="center">(1712-1795)</p>  
<p><DIR>I BEHELD my love this morning, in the garden paths she strayed,<br> All brocaded was the ground with prints her golden pattens made;<br> Like the nightingale, I warbled round my rose with wings displayed,<br> And I wept, my reason faltered, while my heart was sore dismayed.<br> Grant, O Lord, that all my foemen to such grief may be betrayed!</p>  
<p>Love, with these thy whims and humours thou hast wrecked and ruined me.<br> Thou hast drunk of love's own nectar, thy lips speak entrancingly.<br> With those honeyed words how many like me thou hast bound to thee!<br> Take the knife and slay me straightway--pass not by me mockingly.<br> Since I die of love, &#8217;twere better Beauty stabbed and set me free.</p>  
<p>For I have no love beside thee--I would have thee know it well.<br> Thou for whom e&#8217;en death I'd suffer, list to what I have to tell.<br> See thou thwart not thy Creator, all the past do not dispel:<br> Anger not thy Sayat Nova, for when in thy snare he fell<br> He was all bereft of reason by thy whims' and humours' spell.</DIR></p>
