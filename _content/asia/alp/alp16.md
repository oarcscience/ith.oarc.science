### LIBERTY

##### BY MIKAEL NALBANDIAN

(1829-1866)

WHEN the God of Liberty  
Formed of earth this mortal frame,  
Breathed the breath of life in me,  
And a spirit I became,

Wrapped within my swaddling bands,  
Bound and fettered helplessly, <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2)  
I stretched forth my infant hands  
To embrace sweet Liberty.

All night long, until the dawn,  
In my cradle bound I lay;  
And my sobbing's ceaseless moan  
Drove my mother's sleep away.

As I begged her, weeping loud,  
To unbind and set me free;  
From that very day I vowed  
I would love thee, Liberty!

When upon my parents' ear  
First my lisping accents fell,  
And their hearts rejoiced to hear  
Me my childish wishes tell,

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

Then the words that first I spoke  
Were not "father, mother dear":  
"Liberty!" the accents broke  
In my infant utterance clear.

"Liberty!" The voice of Doom  
Echoed to me from above,  
"Wilt thou swear until the tomb  
Liberty to serve and love?

"Thorny is the path, and dim;  
Many trials wait for thee:  
Far too small this world for him  
Who doth worship Liberty!"

"Liberty!" I made reply,  
"O’er my head let thunders burst,  
Lightnings flash, and missiles fly--  
Foes conspire to do their worst;

"Till I die, or meet my doom,  
On the shameful gallows-tree,-  
Till the portals of the tomb,  
I will shout forth Liberty!"
