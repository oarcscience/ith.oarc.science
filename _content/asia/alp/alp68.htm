<p><DIR>DARK forests clothe the mountain-side,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And o&#8217;er that mountain's lofty head<br> The heavens bend their arches wide,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, dome-like, round its summit spread.</p>  
<p>A castle stood upon the steep,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enchanted by a witch's spell;<br> A maiden wept within the keep,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound by the chains of slav&#8217;ry fell.</p>  
<p>Alone and sad, the maiden fair<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat in her dark and narrow room.<br> No hope had she, but dire despair<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had worn her heart with thoughts of gloom.</p>  
<p>A minstrel passed--as it befell<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A singer, singing sweetest strains;<br> He broke the witch's evil spell,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And loosed the gentle maiden's chains.</p>  
<p>She ran to him and kissed his face,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, "How I have longed for thee!<br> God, in His mercy and His grace,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath sent thee here to set me free!"</DIR></p>

<p><DIR>And when, above the mountain steep,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon shone out her silver light,<br> And when the stars began to peep,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twinkling and scatt&#8217;ring jewels bright,</p>  
<p>The minstrel's love stole out unseen,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With burning thoughts of her belov&#8217;d;<br> All through the woods so dark and green,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeking, and seeking him, she roved.</p>  
<p>A hut there was within that wood,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meet dwelling for some dervish old;<br> All lined with moss and leaves, it stood<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protected from the rain and cold.</p>  
<p>The minstrel lived within this nook,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sang alone beneath the trees.<br> His friend--Firdausi's wondrous book,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His comrades--Sadi and Hafiz.</p>  
<p>The Houri of the castle there<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spent many happy days and nights--<br> Immortal souls in Jennet&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> fair<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have never tasted such delights.</p>  
<p>He wiped the tears by sorrow shed,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And healed the wounds by sorrow wrought;<br> Like captive from a prison fled,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her cares and woes she soon forgot.</p>  
<p>Broken and aged was her sire;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mighty Prince, the castle's lord,<br> To satisfy his heart's desire,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had reft her from him with his sword.</DIR></p>

<p><DIR>The Prince held office high at court,<br> And countless women, bright as day,<br> Lived in his harem's vile resort,<br> And slaves, more than my tongue can say.</p>  
<p>His women, guarded day and night,<br> Caged in with iron bars he keeps;<br> But LOVE, more strong than despot's might,<br> Breaks through that cage, those bars o&#8217;erleaps.</DIR></p>
