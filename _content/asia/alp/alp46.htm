<p><DIR>ABOVE the waters, like a hoary giant,<br> The rock stands up, majestic and defiant.<br> The little waves, as to and fro they move,<br> Greet him with kisses and with looks of love.</p>  
<p>The wavelets of the river laugh and dance,<br> As in their arms the mirrored sunbeams glance;<br> And with their smiles of winning, child-like grace,<br> They woo the rock, and murmur in his face:</p>  
<p>"O Aged-One, why art thou never glad?<br> The lines that seam thy countenance are sad.<br> The world is ever changing; thou alone<br> Art still the same with thy dark face of stone.</p>  
<p>"Free children of the mountains ever free,<br> We bring rich gifts of jewels unto thee;<br> Scent thee with perfumes of the mountain rose--<br> Heaven's daughter fair, that on our margin grows.</p>  
<p>"Sweet strains of gentle melody we breathe,<br> And call the fishes from our depths beneath;<br> And gilded with the spring-tide's golden rays,<br> We make thee on our merry revels gaze.</DIR></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_61"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 61</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR>"And songs of love we warble in thine ear,<br> From morning dawn until the stars appear:--<br> We fondle thee, and on thine aged breast<br> Our passions lull, and bid them sink to rest."</p>  
<p>The wavelets hasten, moving to and fro,<br> The rock still sorrows o&#8217;er his ancient woe;<br> The wavelets play, and laughing onward press--<br> The rock remains, gloomy and motionless.</DIR></p>
