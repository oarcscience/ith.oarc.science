### FIRST LETTER WRITTEN BY NESTAN-DAREDJAN TO HER LOVER

<span class="margnote"><span id="363">363</span></span>"I saw the
letter; it was from her for whom fire consumes my heart. The sunbeam
wrote: 'O lion! let not thy wound appear. I am thine. Die not, but I
hate vain fainting. Now Asmat’h tells thee all that is spoken by me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="364">364</span></span>"'Pitiful
fainting and dying, what love dost thou think this! It is better to
exhibit to the beloved deeds of heroism. All dwellers in Khatavet’hi are
our tributaries; now their ill-will towards us cannot be borne by us.

<span class="margnote"><span id="365">365</span></span>"'I was desirous
to wed thee even before, but hitherto I have not found opportunity to
speak. The other day I saw thee deprived of reason sitting in the
litter; then I heard all that had befallen thee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="366">366</span></span>"'I will tell
thee truth; hearken to this that I say to thee: Go, do battle with the
Khatavians, exhibit thyself to me in a goodly manner, this is better for
thee. Weep idly no more; why moisten more the rose! What more can the
sun do to thee! Behold, I have turned thy darkness to dawn.'
