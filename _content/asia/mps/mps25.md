### XXII

### AVT’HANDIL'S PRAYER IN THE MOSQUE, AND HIS FLIGHT

<span class="margnote"><span id="790">790</span></span>He prayed and
said: "Great God of earths and heavens, who sometimes punishest,
sometimes art ready to reward, Unknowable and Unspeakable, Lord of
lordships, give me to endure longings, O ruler of heart-utterances!

<span class="margnote"><span id="791">791</span></span>"God, God, I
beseech Thee, who govern’st the deeps and heights; Thou didst create
love, Thou hast decreed its law; Fate has sundered me from mine
excellent sun; uproot not the love sowed by her for me!

<span class="margnote"><span id="792">792</span></span>"God, God,
merciful, I have none beside Thee; from Thee I beg aid on the road,
however long I travel; shelter me from the mastery of foes, the turmoil
of the seas, the evil one by night! If I survive, I shall serve Thee, I
shall offer sacrifice to Thee."

<span class="margnote"><span id="793">793</span></span>When he had
prayed, he mounted his horse (and) privily passed through the gates; he
sent back Shermadin, albeit he made great lamentations. The vassal weeps
and

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

beats his breast; the wretched man sheds floods of tears. What can
rejoice the vassal deprived of the sight of his lord!

<span class="margnote"><span id="794">794</span></span>Now will I begin
another tale; I will attend the parting knight. There was no audience
that day for the wrathful Rosten. When day dawned he rose sullen; he was
as if he poured flame from his face; he commanded the vizier to be
called; thither they led him pale with fear.
