### XXVI

### OF THE GOING OF AVT’HANDIL TO P’HRIDON'S WHEN HE MET HIM AT MULGHAZANZAR

<span class="margnote"><span id="931">931</span></span>Alas! O world
(Fate), what ails thee? Why dost thou whirl us round? What (? ill) habit
afflicts thee? All who trust in thee weep ceaselessly like me. Whence
and whither earnest thou? Where and whence uprootest thou? But God
abandons not the man forsaken by thee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="932">932</span></span>Avt’handil,
parted from (Tariel), weeps; his voice reaches to the heavens. Quoth he:
"The stream of blood which flowed anew flows once again. Now is parting
as hard as union will be till (we meet) in heaven. Men are not all
equal; there is a great (difference) between man and man."

<span class="margnote"><span id="933">933</span></span>Then the beasts
of the field drank their fill of the tears he shed there; he could not
quench the furnace, he burned with frequent fire. Again the thought of
T’hinat’hin

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

fills him all the more with grief; the coral-rooted crystal shines on
the rose of the lips.

<span class="margnote"><span id="934">934</span></span>The rose is
faded, it drips, the branch of the aloe-tree quivers, the cut crystal
and ruby are changed into lapis-lazuli. He strengthened himself against
death; against him it vaunted not itself. He said: "Why should I wonder
at darkness since thou, O sun, hast abandoned me!"

<span class="margnote"><span id="935">935</span></span>He said to the
sun: "O sun, I compare thee to the cheeks of T’hinat’hin, thou art like
her and she is like thee, ye light mountain and valley. The sight of
thee rejoices me a madman, therefore unweariedly I gaze on thee; but why
have you (both) left my heart cold, unwarmed?

<span class="margnote"><span id="936">936</span></span>The absence of
one sun for a month in winter freezes us; I, alas! have parted from two;
how, then, should heart not be harmed? Only a rock perceives not, is
never hurt! A knife cannot cure a wound; it cuts or causes a swelling."

<span class="margnote"><span id="937">937</span></span>Wending his way
he laments to the sky, he speaks; to the sun he says: "O sun, to thee I
pray, thou mighty of the mightiest mights, who exaltest the humble,
givest sovereignty, happiness (?); part me not from my beloved, turn not
my day to night!" <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20)

<span class="margnote"><span id="938">938</span></span>"Come, O
Zual, <span id="fr_21"></span>[2](#fn_21) add tear to tear, woe to woe;
dye my heart black, give me to thick gloom, heap upon me a heavy load of
grief as on an ass; (but) say to her: 'Forsake him not! Thine he is, and
for thee he weeps.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="939">939</span></span>"O
Musht’har, <span id="fr_22"></span>[3](#fn_22) I entreat thee, thou
just, perfect judge, come and do justice, heart takes counsel with
heart; twist not justice, destroy not thus thy soul. I am righteous,
judge me, why wouldst thou wound afresh me

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="940">940</span></span>"Come, O
Marikh, <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23) mercilessly pierce me with
thy spear, dye me and stain me red with the flow of blood; tell her my
sufferings, let her hear them with the tongue; thou knowest what I am
become, no longer my heart path joy."

<span class="margnote"><span id="941">941</span></span>"Come,
Aspiroz, <span id="fr_24"></span>[2](#fn_24) aid me somewhat; she has
consumed me with the flame of fires, she who encircles the pearl (of her
teeth) with lip of coral; thou beautifiest the fair with such charm (?
as thine); one like me thou abandonest and maddenest."

<span class="margnote"><span id="942">942</span></span>"Otarid! <span
id="fr_25"></span>[3](#fn_25) save thee none other's fate is like to
mine. The sun whirls me, lets me not go, unites with me and gives me
over to burning. Sit down to write my woes! For ink I give thee a lake
of tears, for pen I cut for thee a trim form, slim as a reed."

<span class="margnote"><span id="943">943</span></span>"Come, O Moon,
take pity on me; I shrink and am wasted like thee; the sun fills me, the
sun, too, empties me; sometimes I am full-bodied, sometimes I am spare.
Tell her my tortures, what afflicts me, how I faint. Go, say: 'Forsake
him not!' I am hers, and for her sake I die.

<span class="margnote"><span id="944">944</span></span>"Behold, the
stars bear witness, even the seven confirm my words: the sun, Otarid,
Musht’har and Zual faint for my sake; moon, Aspiroz, Marikh, come and
bear me witness; make her hear what fires consume me without thee
(her)."

<span class="margnote"><span id="945">945</span></span>Now he says to
his heart: "As the tear still flows, and is not dried, what avails it to
slay thyself! It is clear thou hast fraternized with the devil as a
brother. I myself know that she who maddened me has for hair the tail of
a raven; but if thou bearest not grief what is the enduring of joy?

<span class="margnote"><span id="946">946</span></span>"If I remain,
this is better for me"--he speaks of

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

the uncertainty of life--"perchance it will be my lot to see the sun
(T’hinat’hin), I shall not forever cry Alas!" He sang with sweet voice;
he checked not the-channel of tears. Compared to his voice even the
voice of the nightingale was like an owl's.

<span class="margnote"><span id="947">947</span></span>When the knight's
song was heard, the beasts came to listen; by reason of the sweetness of
his voice even the stones came forth from the water, they hearkened,
they marvelled, when he wept they wept; he sings sad songs, tears flow
like a fount.

<span class="margnote"><span id="947a">947a</span></span>All living
creatures on earth came to applaud: game from the forest, fishes in the
water, crocodiles in the sea, birds from the sky, from India, Arabia,
Greece, Orientals and Occidentals, Russians, Persians, Franks and
Egyptians from Misret’hi. <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26)
