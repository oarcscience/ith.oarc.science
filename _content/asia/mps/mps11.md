### VIII

### FIRST LETTER WRITTEN BY TARIEL TO HIS BELOVED

<span class="margnote"><span id="367">367</span></span>"With mine eyes I
gazed upon the letter written by her. I wrote in answer: 'O moon, how
indeed can the sun surpass thee! May God not give me that which is not
like thee! I feel as in a dream; I cannot believe in my survival.'

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="368">368</span></span>"I said to
Asmat’h: 'I cannot devise more answer than this. Say thus to her: O sun!
since thou art arisen as a light for me, behold thou hast quickened me
(who was) dead; I shall faint no more henceforth, whatever be the
service I am a liar if I shun it.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="369">369</span></span>"Asmat’h said to
me: 'She told me: Let us do thus, thus were it better: Whoever sees thee
will discover nothing of my discourse with him; he will come to see me
as if he were making love to thee. She entreated me to tell the Amirbar
so to behave.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="370">370</span></span>"This counsel
pleased me, the wisdom of the heart of her whom even the sun took care
not to gaze on; she had given to me to hear the refined d conversation
of her in whose rays daylight was like darkness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="371">371</span></span>"I gave Asmat’h
choice jewels with a golden cup. She said to me: 'No. I do not want
them; I have these to satiety.' She took one ring weighing a drachmas;
'this is enough for a token; I am full of other bracelets.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="372">372</span></span>"The maid arose
and went forth. The spears spared my heart, joy lightened my darkness,
the fire which had burned me was extinguished. I went in and sat down at
the banquet where my comrades were drinking; joyful, I distributed
gifts, the jubilation increased.
