### XXXI

### P’HATMAN BECOMES ENAMOURED OF AVT’HANDIL; WRITES HIM A LETTER AND SENDS IT

<span class="margnote"><span id="1060">1060</span></span>Desire of
Avt’handil went into the heart of Dame P’hatman, love grew from more to

rained, she poured forth tears.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1061">1061</span></span>"If I tell him

intense. I will speak, let me die or live, let one (or other) be my lot!

piteous letter to be presented to that youth concerning her love,
revealing her sufferings, moving

and shaking the listeners’ heart, a letter to be kept, not to be idly
torn up.
