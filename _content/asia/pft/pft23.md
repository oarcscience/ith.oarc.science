### THE MAN WITH THE COCOANUTS

*Tinguian*

One day a man who had been to gather his cocoanuts loaded his horse
heavily with the fruit. On the way home he *met* a boy whom he asked how
long it would take to reach the house.

"If you go slowly," said the boy, looking at the load on the horse, "you
will arrive very soon; but if you go fast, it will take you all day."

The man could not believe this strange speech, so he hurried his horse.
But the cocoanuts fell off and he had to stop to pick them up. Then he
hurried his horse all the more to make up for lost time, but the
cocoanuts fell off again. Many times he did this, and it was night when
he reached home.  <span id="fr_89"></span>[90](pft68.htm#fn_89)
