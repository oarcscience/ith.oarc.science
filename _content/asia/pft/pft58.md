### JUAN GATHERS GUAVAS

*Tagalog*

One day Juan's father sent him to get some ripe guavas, for a number of
the neighbors had come in and he wanted to give them something to eat.

Juan went to the guava bushes and ate all the fruit he could hold, and
then he decided to play a joke on his father's guests instead of giving
them a feast of guavas. A wasp's nest hung near by. With some difficulty
he succeeded in taking it down and putting it into a tight basket that
he had brought for the fruit. He hastened home and gave the basket to
his father, and then as he left the room where the guests were seated he
closed the door and fastened it.

As soon as Juan's father opened the basket the wasps flew over the room;
and when the people found the door locked they fought to get out of the
windows. After a while Juan opened the door, and when he saw the swollen
faces of the people, he cried.

"What fine, rich guavas you must have had! They have made you all so
fat!".
