<p>A long time ago there was a very big crab &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="pft68.htm#fn_114"><FONT SIZE="1">115</FONT></A> which crawled into the sea. And when he went in he crowded the water out so that it ran all over the earth and covered all the land.</p>  
<p>Now about one moon before this happened, a wise man had told the people that they must build a large raft. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="pft68.htm#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">116</FONT></A> They did as he commanded and cut many large trees, until they had enough to make three layers. These they bound tightly together, and when it was done they fastened the raft with a long rattan cord to a big pole in the earth.</p>  
<p>Soon after this the floods came. White water poured out of the hills, and the sea rose and covered even the highest mountains. The people and animals on the raft were safe, but all the others drowned.</p>  
<p>When the waters went down and the raft was again on the ground, it was near their old home, for the rattan cord had held.</p>  
<p>But these were the only people left on the whole earth.</p>
