*Philippine Folklore Stories*, by John Maurice Miller, \[1904\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Preface

As these stories are only legends that have been handed down from remote
times, the teacher must impress upon the minds of the children that they
are myths and are not to be given credence; otherwise the imaginative
minds of the native children would accept them as truth, and trouble
would be caused that might be hard to remedy. Explain then the fiction
and show the children the folly of belief in such fanciful tales.
