deck.
There are hundreds of others, but the images of the RWS Tarot are the
ones which are instantly recognizable.
This page has abundant detail about the history and
significance of the RWS deck, as well as other texts about Tarot divination.

<A HREF="xr/index">Tarot Card Cross-reference</A><br>
This is an index of all of the Tarot Card images at Intangible Textual Heritage.
Currently this includes the color 1909 RWS deck, the greyscale RWS images
from the Pictorial Key, and the Wirth and Marseilles images from
Tarot of the Bohemians.

<A HREF="tcc/index">Tarot Card Comparison</A><br>
by J.B. Hare<BR>
This presents high resolution images of three cards
from the 1909 Tarot deck and the US Games deck.
Are they different? You be the judge.

<B>NOTE ON THE COLOR TAROT CARD IMAGES</B>:
<A HREF="https://home.comcast.net/~vilex/">Holly Voley</A>
has graciously scanned a set of vintage Tarot cards
for sacred-texts, the earliest in her collection.
These images can be viewed when you click on any of the black and white
thumbnails in the Pictorial Key to the Tarot,
or in the right-hand frame in the Tarot card reader.
They can also be viewed sequentially in the
<A HREF="xr/index">Tarot Card Cross-reference</A>.
These Tarot card images are unambiguously 
in the public domain in the United States, and differ only slightly
from the US Games Tarot deck.
This deck is the one known as the 'Pamela-A' deck
with the <A HREF="pkt/img/verso.jpg">dried mud</A> pattern on the back of
the cards.
There are also high resolution images of three of the Pamela-A cards
available below in the <A HREF="tcc/index">Tarot Card Comparison</A> essay.
