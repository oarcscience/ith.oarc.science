# The Tarot

##### Its Occult Significance, Use in Fortune-Telling, and Method of Play, Etc.

To enter, within the limits of this short treatise, upon any long
inquiry into the History of Cards is utterly out of the question; and I
shall therefore confine myself to examining briefly into what relates to
their most ancient form, the Tarot, or Tarocchi Cards, and to giving, as
clearly and concisely as possible, instructions which will enable my
readers to utilise them for fortune-telling, to which they are far
better adapted, from the greater number and variety of their
combinations, than the ordinary cards. I shall also enter somewhat into
their occult and Qabalistical significations.

The term "Tarot", or "Tarocchi", is applied to a pack of 78 cards,
consisting of four suits of 14 cards each (there being one more court
card than in the ordinary packs--the Cavalier, Knight, or Horseman), and
22 symbolical picture-cards answering for trumps. These latter are
numbered from 1 to 21 inclusive, the 22nd card being marked Zero, 0. The
designs of these trumps are extremely singular, among them being such
representations as Death, the Devil, the Last Judgment, &c.

The idea that cards were first "invented' to amuse Charles VI of France
is now exploded; and it is worthy of note in this connection that their
supposititious "inventor" was Jacques Gringonneur, an Astrologer and
Qabalist. Furthermore, cards were known prior to this period among the
Indians and the Chinese. Etteilla, indeed, gives in one of his tracts on
the Tarot a representation of the mystical arrangement of these cards in
the Temple of Ptah at Memphis, and he further says:

"Upon a table or altar, at the height of the breast of the Egyptian
Magus (or Hierophant), were on one side a book or assemblage of cards or
plates of gold (the Tarot), and on the other a vase, etc." This idea is
further dilated upon by P. Christian (the disciple of Eliphas Levi), in
his *"Histoire de la Magie*," to which I shall have occasion to refer
later. The great exponents of the Tarot, Court de Gèbelin, Levi, and
Etteilla, have always assigned to the Tarot a Qabalistico-Egyptian
origin, and this I have found confirmed in my own researches into this
subject, which have extended over several years.

W. Hughes Willshire, in his remarks on the General History of
Playing-Cards, says: "The most ancient cards which have come down to us
are of the Tarot's character. These are the four cards of the Musée
Correr at Venice; the seventeen pieces of the Paris Cabinet (erroneously
often called the *Gringonneur,* or Charles VI cards of 1392), five
Venetian Tarots of the fifteenth century, in the opinion of some not of
an earlier date than 1425; and the series of cards belonging to a
*Minchiate* set, in the possession of the Countess Aurelia Visconti
Gonzaga at Milan, when Cicognara wrote."

W. A. Chatto, in his "*History of Playing-Cards*," says that cards were
invented in China as early as A.D. 1120, in the reign of Seun-Ho, for
the amusement of his numerous concubines.

J. F. Vaillant, in "*Les Romes, histoire vraie des vraies Bohémiens*,"
Paris, 1857, says that the Chinese have a drawing divided into
compartments or series, based on combinations of the number 7. <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0) "It so closely resembles the Tarot, that the
four suits of the latter occupy its first four columns; of the
twenty-one *atouts* fourteen occupy the fifth column, and the seven
other *atouts* the sixth column. This sixth column of seven *atouts* is
that of the six days of the week of creation. Now, according to the
Chinese, this representation belongs to the first ages of their empire,
to the drying up of the waters of the deluge by IAO; it may be
concluded, therefore, that it is an original, or a copy of the Tarot,
and, under any circumstances, that the latter is of an origin anterior
to Moses, that it belongs to the beginning of our time, to the epoch of
the preparation of the Zodiac, and consequently that it must own 6600
years of existence."

But, notwithstanding the apparent audacity of this latter statement, it
must be evident on reflection that the Tarot, consisting, as it does, of
the ten numbers of the decimal scale counter-changed with the tetrad,
and of a hieroglyphic alphabet of twenty-two mystic symbols, must be
relegated to far earlier period in the history of the world than that
usually assigned to the introduction of cards into Europe; and we may
take the fact of the Tarot being the origin of the modern card as being
now pretty well established by general consensus of Opinion.

It was Court de Gèbelin who, in his "*Monde Primitif*" (Paris 1781),
wrote: "Were we to hear that there exists in our day Work of the Ancient
Egyptians, one of their books which had escaped the flames which
devoured their superb libraries, and which contains their purest
doctrine on most interesting subjects, every one would doubtless be
anxious to acquire the knowledge of so valuable and extraordinary a
work. Were we to add that this book is widely spread through a large
part of Europe, and that for several centuries it has been accessible to
every one, would not it be still more surprising? And would not that
surprise be at its height were it asserted that people have never
suspected that it was Egyptian, that they possess it in such a manner
that they can hardly be said to possess it at all, that no one has ever
attempted to decipher a single leaf, and that the outcome of a recondite
wisdom is regarded as a mass of extravagant designs which mean nothing
in themselves? Would not people think that one was trying to amuse
oneself with, and to play upon the credulity of one's hearers?

"Yet this is a true fact. This Egyptian book, the sole remains of their
superb libraries, exists to our day; it is even so common that no
*savant* has designed to trouble himself about it, no one before myself
having suspected its illustrious origin. This book is composed of
seventy-seven leaves or illustrations, or rather of seventy-eight,
divided into five classes, which each present objects as various as they
are amusing and instructive. In one word, this book is the PACK OF TAROT
CARDS."

Let us now examine the word TAROT, or TARO, and discover, if we can, its
true derivation and meaning. Court de Gèbelin states that there are
three words of Oriental origin preserved in the nomenclature of the
Pack. These are TARO, MAT*,* and PAGAD. Taro, he says, is pure Egyptian;
from TAR, Path, and RO, ROS, or ROG, Royal--the Royal Path of Life. MAT
is Oriental, and means overpowered, murdered, crack-brained; while
PAGAD, he adds, is also Oriental, form PAG, chief, or master, and GAD,
Fortune. Vailant says: "The great divinity Ashtaroth, As-*taroth,* is no
other than the Indo-Tartar *Tan-tara,* the *Tarot,* the Zodiac." My
derivation of the word, which I have never found given by any author, is
from the ancient hieroglyphical Egyptian word "*târu",* to require an
answer, or to consult; *ergo,* that which is consulted, or from which an
answer is required. This appears to me to be the correct origin of the
word, while the second *t* is an Egyptian hieroglyphic final, which is
added to denote the feminine gender. The following are interesting
metatheses of the letters of TARO: TORA *(Hebrew)* = Law; TROA
*(Hebrew)* = Gate; ROTA *(Latin)* = wheel; ORAT *(Latin)* = it speaks,
argues, or entreats; TAOR *(Egyptian)* = Täur, the Goddess of Darkness;
ATOR *(Egyptian)* = Athor, the Egyptian Venus. A Mr. Lumley tells me
that there is a Zend word *"tarisk",* meaning "to require an answer".

There are Italian, Spanish, and German Tarot packs, and since the time
of Etteilla French also, but these latter are not so well adapted for
occult study owing to Etteilla's attempted "corrections" of the
symbolism. The Italian are decidedly the best for divination and
practical occult purposes, and I shall, therefore, use them as the basis
of the present treatise. Unfortunately the old-fashioned single-headed
cards are obsolete now, and the only ones made are double-headed, which
circumstance alters the symbolism in a few instances. I shall,
therefore, wherever necessary, describe the omitted portion of the
design, enclosing it within brackets to mark the same.

As I before observed, the Tarot pack consists of seventy-eight
cards--namely, four suits of fourteen cards each, and twenty-two
symbolic numbered trumps. The four suits are--

Each suit consists of Ace, Deuce, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight,
Nine, Ten; Fanti or Valet = Knave; Cavallo = Knight or Horseman; Dama or
Reine = Queen; Re =  King.

The Kings, in each instance, wear a cap-of-maintenance beneath the
crown; the Queens wear the crown only. The Queen of Pentacles and the
Knave of Sceptres are the only ones represented in profile. In the suit
of Sceptres the King bears a wand akin to that represented on the small
cards of the suit, while the other three honours bear a bludgeon similar
to that which is shown for the ace. In the suit of cups, that only which
is held by the Queen is covered, thus showing the essentially *feminine*
properties of this suit, while the sceptre held by the King of the
preceding suit shows its more *masculine* character.

If we examine the small cards carefully we shall be struck a once by the
comparative similarities of pattern of the Sceptres and the Swords,
which are only distinguished from each other by the former being
*straight* and the latter being *curved.* We shall also notice that the
Deuces have peculiarities of their own, which distinguish them from the
rest of the suit. The Deuce of Sceptres forms a cross with two roses and
two lilies in the opposite angles; the Cross between the Rose of Sharon
and the Lily of the Valley. The Deuce of Cups shows a tesselated
pavement or cloth whereon the cups stand; between them is a species of
Caduceus, whose serpents are replaced by Lion-headed foliations, which
recall the Chnuphis Serpent of the Gnostics, and certain familiar forms
of the Elemental Spirits; *practical* occultists will know to what I
allude. The Deuce of Swords forms a species of *Vesica piscis* enclosing
a mystic rose of the primary colours. The Deuce of Pentacles is bound
together by a continuous band in such a manner as to form a figure 8,
and represents the one as being the reflection of the other, as the
Universe is that of the Divine Idea.

The four Aces stand out by themselves from the rest of the pack, each
forming, as it were, the Key of its respective suit. The Ace of Sceptres
recalls the Club of Hercules; it is surrounded by eight detached leaves,
whose shape recalls that of the Hebrew Letter Yod, or I, and is crowned
with the Symbol of the Triad represented by the three lopped branches;
it is the Symbol of Almighty Strength within the cube of the Universe,
which latter is shown by the eight leaves, for eight is the first
cubical number. The Ace of Cups is of Egyptian origin, which can be more
easily seen in the Spanish Tarot. The figure, like an inverted M on its
front, is all that remains of the Egyptian twin Serpents which
originally decorated it. It represents the Waters of Creation in the
first chapter of Genesis. It is the Symbol of the Power which receives
and modifies. The Ace of Swords is a Sword surmounted by a Crown, from
which depend on either side an olive and a palm branch, symbolic of
mercy and severity; around it are Six Hebrew Yods, recalling the Six
days of the Mosaic Creation. It is the Symbol of that Justice which
maintains the World in order, the equilibrium of Mercy and Severity. The
Ace of Pentacles represents Eternal Synthesis, the great whole of the
visible Universe, the Realisation of counterbalanced power.

The 22 trumps are the hieroglyphic symbols of the occult meanings of the
22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. They are numbered from 0 to 21
inclusive. (See Table).
