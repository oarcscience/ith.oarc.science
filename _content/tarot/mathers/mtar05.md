### TAROT GAME PLAY

These Tarot Cards may be used like the ordinary packs for games, as well
as for divination; and it may be as well to give the general rules and
mode of play. The Game of Tarot may be played by either two or three
persons. The full pack of 78 cards is shuffled and cut in the ordinary
manner. The dealer dears them out in three hands by five cards at a
time, and places the remaining three cards at his own right-hand side.
There will thus be three hands of 25 cards each, and three cards
besides. The players sort their hands, and the dealer discards the three
most useless cards in his own hand and exchanges them for the
before-mentioned three cards. The deal is taken in rotation by each
player. The method of dealing is the same, whether *two* or *three*
players participate, three hands being dealt out in each instance, but
if only two players contend with each other, the third hand is untouched
by either party.

The points constituting the game are 100, which may be marked on a
cribbage board, on paper, or by an ordinary bezique-marker.

Before the hands are played out their score is reckoned in the following
way:

|                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------|
| The 22 trumps are not all of the same value.            |
| 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, are called the Five Greater Trumps. |
| 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, are called the Five Lesser Trumps.       |

Whoever has three of the Greater or three of the Lesser Trumps in his
hand, scores 5 points for the same; 10 points if he has four; and 15
points if he have all five. If the player has *any* ten trumps in his
hand they will score 10 points, *any* thirteen trumps 15 points. It does
not matter if Greater or Lesser Trumps, which have been already scored,
form part of such ten or thirteen; all scores are independent of other
combinations. Furthermore, for any cards to be scored they must be shown
to the adversary at the time of scoring; this rule holds good in all
cases. The non-dealer scores and leads first. If three play, the player
on the dealer's left hand begins.

Seven cards bear the distinguishing title of Tarot Trumps; they are:

The Universe, 21; the Mat, or Foolish Man, 0; the Pagad, Juggler, or
Magician, 1; the King of Sceptres; the King of Cups; the King of Swords;
and the King of Pentacles.

If the player has any two of these Tarot Trumps, he can ask his opponent
for a third; if the latter cannot reply by showing a third Tarot Trump,
the former can score 5 points; but if he has the third it must be given
up to the asker, who then does not score, but gives him some card of
small value in exchange. For every three Tarot Trumps actually held in
the hand, the holder marks 15 points.

Sequences of trumps or of cards of the same suit count; for every four
cards in sequence, 5 points; for every seven cards, 10 points; for ten
cards, 15 points. All cards forming these scores must be shown to the
adversary.

0, *The Foolish Man,* is the lowest card in the pack in playing the
hand; can take no card of any suit, and may be played to a card of any
suit. For instance, if the adversary leads a King, and you have only the
Queen of that suit remaining in your hand, but have also the 0, you can
play this instead of the Queen, and thus save her from being taken. A
King cut counts 5 points to whosoever cuts it. In each suit King is
highest, then come Queen, Knight, Knave, Ten, Nine, etc., down to Ace,
which is lowest, and can only take the 0. The Trumps reckon from 21,
which is highest, to 1, which is lowest. You must follow suit if you
can; if not, you may trump. Each trick should be kept separate for
counting afterwards. Of course, the principal care of the player should
be directed towards saving his own important cards, and taking those of
the adversary. The player who takes a trick leads next. When all the
hand is played out, the tricks on either side are counted as follows:--

For every trick in which there is a Tarot Trump, 5 points (the 0 counts
to its *original* possessor, while the Pagad, 1, counts to the player
who takes it). For every trick with a

Queen, 4 points; with a Knight, 3 points; with a Knave, 2 points; for
every other trick, 1 point.

At the end of each hand the points made by each player are added up
separately, then the lesser is taken from the greater, and only the
*excess* points of the more fortunate player are scored. The same is
done in each hand, and the player who, in this way, first reaches 100
points *(or over* in the final hand) wins the game.

For my reader's convenience I append a table of the points which can be
scored:

 If three players contend, of course the third player will form an
additional factor in the game. Then, when the three compare their
various scores in the same hand, only he who has most should score, and
then only the amount by which he exceeds the player who comes second.
The other players do not score at all.
