A calm, stately personage, with his back turned, looking from a cliff's
edge at ships passing over the sea. Three staves are planted in the
ground, and he leans slightly on one of them. *Divinatory Meanings*: He
symbolizes established strength, enterprise, effort, trade, commerce,
discovery; those are his ships, bearing his merchandise, which are
sailing over the sea. The card also signifies able co-operation in
business, as if the successful merchant prince were looking from his
side towards yours with a view to help you. *Reversed*: The end of
troubles, suspension or cessation of adversity, toil and disappointment.
