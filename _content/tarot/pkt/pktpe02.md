A young man, in the act of dancing, has a pentacle in either hand, and
they are joined by that endless cord which is like the number 8
reversed. *Divinatory Meanings*: On the one hand it is represented as a
card of gaiety, recreation and its connexions, which is the subject of
the design; but it is read also as news and messages in writing, as
obstacles, agitation, trouble, embroilment. *Reversed*: Enforced gaiety,
simulated enjoyment, literal sense, handwriting, composition, letters of
exchange.
