The Wands throughout this suit are always in leaf, as it is a suit of
life and animation. Emotionally and otherwise, the Queen's personality
corresponds to that of the King, but is more magnetic. *Divinatory
Meanings*: A dark woman, countrywoman, friendly, chaste, loving,
honourable. If the card beside her signifies a man, she is well disposed
towards him; if a woman, she is interested in the Querent. Also, love of
money, or a certain success in business. *Reversed*: Good, economical,
obliging, serviceable. Signifies also--but in certain positions and in
the neighbourhood of other cards tending in such directions--opposition,
jealousy, even deceit and infidelity.
