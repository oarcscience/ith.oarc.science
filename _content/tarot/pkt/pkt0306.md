### § 6 THE ART OF TAROT DIVINATION

We come now to the final and practical part of this division of our
subject, being the way to consult and obtain oracles by means of Tarot
cards. The modes of operation are rather numerous, and some of them are
exceedingly involved. I set aside those last mentioned, because persons
who are versed in such questions believe that the way of simplicity is
the way of truth. I set aside also the operations which have been
republished recently in that section of The Tarot of the Bohemians which
is entitled "The Divining Tarot"; it may be recommended at its proper
value to readers who wish to go further than the limits of this
handbook. I offer in the first place a short process which has been used
privately for many years past in England, Scotland and Ireland. I do not
think that it has been published--certainly not in connexion with Tarot
cards; I believe that it will serve all purposes, but I will add by way
of variation-in the second place what used to be known in France as the
Oracles of Julia Orsini.
