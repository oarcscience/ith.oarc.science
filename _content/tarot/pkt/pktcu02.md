A youth and maiden are pledging one another, and above their cups rises
the Caduceus of Hermes, between the great wings of which there appears a
lion's head. It is a variant of a sign which is found in a few old
examples of this card. Some curious emblematical meanings are attached
to it, but they do not concern us in this place. *Divinatory Meanings*:
Love, passion, friendship, affinity, union, concord, sympathy, the
interrelation of the sexes, and--as a suggestion apart from all offices
of divination--that desire which is not in Nature, but by which Nature
is sanctified.
