A young man on a craggy eminence brandishing a staff; six other staves
are raised towards him from below. *Divinatory Meanings*: It is a card
of valour, for, on the surface, six are attacking one, who has, however,
the vantage position. On the intellectual plane, it signifies
discussion, wordy strife; in business--negotiations, war of trade,
barter, competition. It is further a card of success, for the combatant
is on the top and his enemies may be unable to reach him. *Reversed*:
Perplexity, embarrassments, anxiety. It is also a caution against
indecision.
