### The Hanged Man

The gallows from which he is suspended forms a *Tau* cross, while the
figure--from the position of the legs--forms a fylfot cross. There is a
nimbus about the head of the seeming martyr. It should be noted (1) that
the tree of sacrifice is living wood, with leaves thereon; (2) that the
face expresses deep entrancement, not suffering; (3) that the figure, as
a whole, suggests life in suspension, but life and not death. It is a
card of profound significance, but all the significance is veiled. One
of his editors suggests that Éliphas Lévi did not know the meaning,
which is unquestionable nor did the editor himself. It has been called
falsely a card of martyrdom, a card a of prudence, a card of the Great
Work, a card of duty; but we may exhaust all published interpretations
and find only vanity. I will say very simply on my own part that it
expresses the relation, in one of its aspects, between the Divine and
the Universe.

He who can understand that the story of his higher nature is imbedded in
this symbolism will receive intimations concerning a great awakening
that is possible, and will know that after the sacred Mystery of Death
there is a glorious Mystery of Resurrection.
