The figure leans upon his staff and has an expectant look, as if
awaiting an enemy. Behind are eight other staves--erect, in orderly
disposition, like a palisade. *Divinatory Meanings*: The card signifies
strength in opposition. If attacked, the person will meet an onslaught
boldly; and his build shews, that he may prove a formidable antagonist.
With this main significance there are all its possible adjuncts--delay,
suspension, adjournment. *Reversed*: Obstacles, adversity, calamity.
