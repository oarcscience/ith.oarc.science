A man of dejected aspect is deserting the cups of his felicity,
enterprise, undertaking or previous concern. *Divinatory Meanings*: The
card speaks for itself on the surface, but other readings are entirely
antithetical--giving joy, mildness, timidity, honour, modesty. In
practice, it is usually found that the card shews the decline of a
matter, or that a matter which has been thought to be important is
really of slight consequence--either for good or evil. *Reversed*: Great
joy, happiness, feasting.
