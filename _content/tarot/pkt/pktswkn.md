He is riding in full course, as if scattering his enemies. In the design
he is really a prototypical hero of romantic chivalry. He might almost
be Galahad, whose sword is swift and sure because he is clean of heart.
*Divinatory Meanings*: Skill, bravery, capacity, defence, address,
enmity, wrath, war, destruction, opposition, resistance, ruin. There is
therefore a sense in which the card signifies death, but it carries this
meaning only in its proximity to other cards of fatality. *Reversed*:
Imprudence, incapacity, extravagance.
