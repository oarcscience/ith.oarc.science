In a scene similar to the former, a young man stands in the act of
proclamation. He is unknown but faithful, and his tidings are strange.
*Divinatory Meanings*: Dark young man, faithful, a lover, an envoy, a
postman. Beside a man, he will bear favourable testimony concerning him.
A dangerous rival, if followed by the Page of Cups. Has the chief
qualities of his suit. He may signify family intelligence. *Reversed*:
Anecdotes, announcements, evil news. Also indecision and the instability
which accompanies it.
