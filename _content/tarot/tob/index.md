*Tarot of the Bohemians*, along with the *[Pictoral Key to the
Tarot](../pkt/index)*, constitute the core literature of 19th and early
20th century 'Tarotism'. However, PTK is to the TOB as arithmetic is to
differential calculus. If you have no experience reading occult
literature of this period, you may find yourself profoundly lost after
the first couple of pages, staring at the abundant and profoundly
esoteric tables, charts and diagrams, trying to get a clue as to what
Papus is talking about. Papus is after a 'Theory of Everything', and
finds evidence for it in the Tarot and a set of correspondences with
everything from the tetragrammaton to numerology and astrology.

His claim that the Tarot preserves ancient, profound knowledge by way of
the Romany/Gypsies (i.e. 'Bohemians') all the way back to Egypt, India
and Atlantis is unsubstantiated. There is no evidence of any kind of
playing or fortune-telling cards prior to the thirteenth century, either
in literature or folklore. Note that playing cards could not have become
popular until the introduction of printing in Europe. The Tarot is
believed to have originated from an elaborate deck of cards invented in
Italy in the fourteenth century. The Romany people probably started to
use this deck for cartomancy (fortune telling by cards) about a century
thereafter. As Papus notes, all of the early cards depict people dressed
in the costume of this period.

Late in the book, Papus condescends to pen a section, in his words, 'for
the ladies' (cue Barry White music here), which gives some basic
instruction in cartomancy using the Tarot deck. However, this is by far
the weakest portion of this book. Papus is at his best when he is
spinning elaborate webs of correspondence between the Tarot and the
Macrocosm. This book is hard work, but if you master it you will have a
profound grasp of the inner life of the Tarot deck.
