# SECOND LESSON.

### MINOR ARCANA. SIGNIFICATION FROM THE DIVINING POINT OF VIEW.

THE Tarot pack is composed of 78 cards or plates; 22 of them bear
symbolical names (the Juggler, Sun, Moon, Hanged Man, etc.), and they
should be separated from the 56 others, which are divided into four
great series: Sceptres, Cups, Swords, and Pentacles.

These four series each contain 14 cards (King, Queen, Knight, Knave,
Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10), corresponding with the four series
of common playing cards (clubs, hearts, spades, diamonds), but called
Sceptres, Cups, Swords, Pentacles. These are the *Minor Arcana*.

The 22 symbolical cards are the *Major Arcana* or Great Arcana.

1\. MINOR ARCANA, formed of four sequences of 14 cards each, or 56 cards
in all.

2\. MAJOR ARCANA, formed of 22 cards.

These are the two great divisions which must first be remembered.

We have already said that the minor arcana were divided into four
sequences: Sceptres, Cups, Swords, Pentacles. Each of these series
represents one of the four great principles, as follows--

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

ENTERPRISE, LOVE, HATRED, FORTUNE, are the four great principles which
must be remembered.

If you now take one of these packets of 14 cards, you will see that it
is formed of four figures, and of 10 other cards, which bear numbers
formed by the symbols.

We will first look at the 4 figures--

<table data-cellspacing="0" data-border="0" data-cellpadding="9" width="666">

<col style="width: 33%" />

<tr class="even">
<td width="34%" data-valign="TOP"><em></em>
<p>The Queen </p></td>
<td width="33%" data-valign="TOP"><p>---</p></td>
<td width="33%" data-valign="TOP"><em></em>
<p>Woman.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td width="34%" data-valign="TOP"><em></em>
<p>The Knight </p></td>
<td width="33%" data-valign="TOP"><p>---</p></td>
<td width="33%" data-valign="TOP"><em></em>
<p>A Young Man.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td width="34%" data-valign="TOP"><em></em>
<p>The Knave </p></td>
<td width="33%" data-valign="TOP"><p>---</p></td>
<td width="33%" data-valign="TOP"><em></em>
<p>A Child.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

 

The Man represents the creator, the one who undertakes the
*enterprises*; the woman characterizes *love*; the young man, conflict,
struggle, rivalry, *hatred*; the child symbolizes the absolute neuter,
the second He, which varies according to circumstances, *money*, which
addresses itself to all, and applies itself to all, *universal
transition*. Man, Woman, Young Man, Child, are therefore the same
symbols applied to the family as the four great principles applied to
humanity, and to know them in one case is to know them in the other.

To sum up all this, we may say that the first element represents the
*positive*, the second the *negative*, the third the *opposition*
between the two; finally, the last the *absolute neuter*; and these
elements are symbolized by the four figures of each of the minor arcana.

But even as the cards are divided into two colours, red and black, so
humanity is divided into *dark* and *fair*.

The eight figures of the Sceptres and Swords therefore

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

represent *dark people*, the eight figures of the Cups and Pentacles,
*fair people*.

The figures of the Sceptres and Cups are *good*; of the Swords and
Pentacles, *bad*.

We shall presently repeat this in connection with each colour, and will
now recapitulate the meanings of the four figures of the Sceptres.

King of Sceptres. Dark man; good; a friend.  
Queen of Sceptres: Dark woman; good.  
Knight of Sceptres: Dark young man; good.  
Knave of Sceptres: Dark child or messenger; good.

Besides our four figures we have to consider the 10 cards bearing
numbers. How can we discover the meaning of these 10 cards, and above
all how can we recall it?

We have nothing new to learn, but need only apply all that we already
know. We divide our 10 cards into four packets: three packets of 3 cards
each, and one packet formed of a single card, the 10th. When this is
done we say--

The first packet of 3 cards, formed of the ace, 2, and 3, will have the
same meaning as the *Man*, enterprise, commencement, the creation of
some undertaking (enterprise, love, hatred, or money).

The second packet, composed of the 4, 5, and 6, represents *Woman*, and
all the ideas of negation, of reflection, associated with her; that is
to say, the opposite of man, antagonism, opposition in any matter.

The third packet signifies the equilibrium which results from the action
of the two opposites upon each other, represented by the *Young Man*.

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

Lastly, the *Child*, the absolute neuter, will be represented by the
10th card.

Each of the 3 cards in these packets have the same meaning.

The first card of these 3 packets will indicate the commencement; the
second, opposition, antagonism; the third, equilibrium, which gives us
the following general sequence in our 10 cards.

10\. Undetermined: The card which follows will explain it.

 

Thus the three words, Commencement, Opposition, Equilibrium, the
synonyms of *Thesis*, *Antithesis*, *Synthesis*, or of *Brahma*, *Siva*,
*Vishnu*, etc., suffice for the explanation of all the minor arcana of
the Tarot. We need only add the words love, hatred, enterprise or
fortune to each of the series, and we can define the meaning of every
card without wearying the memory. This we will now do.

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

SIGNIFICATION OF THE FOUR SERIES OF THE MINOR ARCANA IN THE DIVINING
TAROT.

SCEPTRES.

Creation. *Enterprise*. *Agriculture*.

KING. The King of Sceptres symbolizes a dark man, a friend. He generally
represents a married man, the father of a family.

QUEEN. A dark woman, a friend. Represents a serious woman, a very good
counsellor, often the mother of a family.

KNIGHT. A dark young man, a friend.

KNAVE. A dark child, a friend. Also represents a message from a near
relation.

ACE OF SCEPTRES. *Commencement of an Enterprise*.

TWO. *Opposition to the commencement of the Enterprise*.

The Enterprise is commenced when an unexpected obstacle suddenly
prevents its execution.

THREE. *Realization of the commencement of the Enterprise*.

The basis of the work is now definitely established, and the undertaking
can be fearlessly continued.

FOUR. *Obstacles to the Enterprise*.

Nothing can be accomplished without obstacles. We therefore now find
them appearing, and must prepare ourselves to overcome them.

FIVE. *Opposition to the obstacles. Victory after surmounting them*.

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

Six. *Realization of the opposition*.

At last the obstacles succeed. *Failure of the Enterprise* in the midst
of its execution.

SEVEN. *Certain success to the Enterprise*.

EIGHT. *Opposition to its success*. The Enterprise will only partially
succeed.

NINE. *Realization of success*. Success is continued.

TEN. Uncertainty in the management of the Enterprise.

CUPS.

Preservation. *Love*. *Instruction*.

Knowing the meaning of one series, we know *à priori* the significations
of the three others. We shall however give them in order to facilitate
the work.

KING OF CUPS. *A fair man, a friend*. This card also represents a
barrister, judge, or ecclesiastic. It symbolizes a Bachelor.

QUEEN OF CUPS. *A fair woman, a friend*. The woman loved. The Mistress.

KNIGHT OF CUPS. *A young fair man, a friend*. The young man loved. The
Lover.

KNAVE OF CUPS. *A fair child*. A messenger. *Birth*.

ACE OF CUPS. *Commencement of a love affair*.

Two. *Opposition to this commencement*. Unimportant obstacles raised by
one of the lovers.

THREE. *Realization of this commencement*. The love is mutual.

FOUR. *Serious obstacles to the love*. They arise from other persons,
not from the lovers.

FIVE. *Opposition to the obstacles*. Victory over the obstacles after a
struggle.

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

Six. *The obstacles triumph*. Love destroyed in the midst of happiness.
Widowhood.

SEVEN. *Success assured to the lovers*.

EIGHT. *Partial failure of love*. Love only partially succeeds.

NINE. Motherhood.

TEN. Uncertainty in the management of the love affair.

SWORDS.

Transformation. *Hatred*. *War*.

KING OF SWORDS. *A dark, bad man*. He is a soldier, a powerful enemy,
who must be distrusted.

QUEEN OF SWORDS. *A dark wicked woman*. The card also indicates her
actions, *gossip and calumnies*.

KNIGHT. *A young, dark man, an enemy*. He is also a *spy*.

KNAVE. *A child, an enemy*. *Bad news*. *Delay*.

The figures generally indicate opposition raised outside the house.

ACE OF SWORDS. *Commencement of enmity*.

Two. *Opposition to this commencement*. The enmity does not last.

THREE. Realization of the enmity. *Hatred*.

FOUR. Opposition to the hatred. *Success against the enemy*.

FIVE. *Opposition to this opposition*. The enemy triumphs at the moment
one fancies the victory is secured.

SIX. *Equilibrium of the opposition*. The enemy is rendered powerless at
last.

SEVEN. *Success assured to the enemy*.

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

EIGHT. *Partial opposition to this success*. The enemy only partially
triumphs.

NINE. *Certain duration of the hatred*.

TEN. Uncertainty in the enmity.

PENTACLES.

Development. *Money*. *Trade*.

KING OF PENTACLES. *A fair man*, inimical or indifferent.

QUEEN OF PENTACLES. *A fair woman*, indifferent, or inimical.

KNIGHT. *A young, fair man*. A stranger. *An arrival*.

KNAVE. *A fair child*. A messenger. *A letter*.

The figures of the Pentacles are inverse to those of the Sceptres and
Cups, and indicate all that comes from outside, from the country or
abroad.

ACE OF PENTACLES. *Commencement of fortune*. Inheritance. Gifts.
Economy, etc., etc.

Two. *Opposition to this commencement*. Difficulty in well establishing
the first landmarks of good fortune.

THREE. *Realization of this commencement of fortune*. A small sum.

FOUR. Opposition of fortune. *Loss of money*.

FIVE. Opposition to this opposition. *A success coming which will
balance the low*.

Six. Realization of the opposition. *Ruin*.

SEVEN. Success assured. *A large fortune*.

EIGHT. *Partial success*. Great loss of money at the moment apparently
of definitely securing the fortune.

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

NINE. Equilibrium of Equilibrium. *A durable fortune*.

TEN. *Uncertainty in the fortune*. Great success and great reverses.

As a whole, we see the same series always repeating themselves. It
therefore requires little time to thoroughly learn the meaning of the
minor arcana, even without much memory. We advise those readers who fear
they may forget them, to simply write the meaning on the cards
themselves. However, professional card readers are careful not to do
this, for intuition often leads them to an interpretation which differs
from the exact meaning of the card.
