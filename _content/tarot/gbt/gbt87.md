E offer the descriptions in this work with the most humble reserve as
regards completeness. We are fully aware, that on these lines the last
word will not be said in the near future. On the other hand we feel
sure, that the key to the mystic system, known as the TARO(T), presented
here, does work, for we have used it in practical divination for some
time already and it has proved to be true, apart from its theoretical
value, which may be judged by those who have studied the ancient
mysteries in general and astrology in particular.

We abstain from adding more concerning the practice of divination in the
present volume--it will demand another one.
