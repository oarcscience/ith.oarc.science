#### Eight of Swords

TRADITION: Critical position, censure, crisis, chagrin, examination,
research, control, condemnation, judgment, sickness, calumny. Reversed:
Difficulty, obstacle, accident, treachery, fatality, adventure, etc.

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

THEORY: The element of *Earth* on the *Eighth house*, the house of death
and of the greatest difficulties of life, the inner problems and sex.
The image drawn on this card may well indicate the blindness of man
amidst the dangers of this world and of his own desire-nature. It must
indicate physical sex-nature above all. Further, we shall find
everything relating to the revenge of matter upon spirit, the latter
being bound and blinded by the former, consequently everything in the
nature of obstacles and hindrances, pain and affliction. The house of
'avenging justice' may well cause a condemnation, or a sickness which is
the result of sinning against nature's laws; patience is required where
this card rules and endurance will save the position. In its most
general sense it means the binding by the laws of matter, suffering from
the lack of money, impotence by debt or material want, poverty. It may
be a great strain on the feelings. As the eight of each suit is accepted
as indicating some feminine influence to which we are ready to
subscribe, there will be danger from an acquisitive girl or uncouth
female here, or even sickness through same. As far as material laws are
compelling in this world, there must of course be 'fatality' in this
card, or at least something from which there will be no physical escape.

CONCLUSION: *Obstacles, conflict, danger, hampering, affliction,
criticism, sex-problems of a threatening nature, danger of death
sometimes, fatality; revenge, debt, poverty, condemnation, sickness.
Patience and endurance will be necessary or helpful. Uncouth female.
Incident or accident*.
