#### Queen of Pentacles

TRADITION: Dark woman, who suggests "the idea of greatness of soul; she
has also the serious cast of intelligence." (*W*.) Opulence, riches,
luxury, assurance (insurance?), security, liberty, frankness. Reversed:
Doubt, indecision, uncertainty, timidity, apprehension, vacillation,
etc.

THEORY: The higher octave of the *two*, consequently covering the *Sixth
house* and demonstrating the features of the noble Virgo-type. So this
must be a woman always inclined to help and to serve, to make herself
useful, a nurse perhaps, a household woman of good
[standing](errata.htm#2) a good hostess. There are also qualities of
science in this house, as it is the house of the Academy and Minerva. So
she may be as an incarnation of Minerva herself, protecting science and
craftsmanship as the Dame of Wands protects the arts. She must have many
qualities and above all refinement, though she may suffer more or less
from the evil--so far as it can be called--of doubt, and the difficulty
of choosing between

many possibilities in her nature. She is generous and benefic. Her
presence is a good augury and she brings always protection and material
wealth or at least well-being, ruling this house of earth. There may be
some timidity; there is always honesty, honourable action, correctness
and the right attitude to all problems of life, discretion, education,
understanding, knowledge. These qualities certainly engender security in
life.

CONCLUSION: *A good and intelligent woman, who will render service to
the querent, benefic influence, help, assistance in word, advice and
action. Woman of good standing and refined type, the personification of
honesty, protection, knowledge, understanding, education, culture.
Discretion may sometimes lapse into timidity through sensitiveness.
Material benefit, earnings, wealth, rent, products. Security,
assuredness, insurance, certificate or diploma. Patronage of science and
technical and industrial works*.
