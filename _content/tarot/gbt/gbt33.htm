<p>TRADITION: Enterprise, effort, essay, trade, commerce, discovery, usurpation, daring, temerity and also imprudence, interruption, cessation and 'the end of troubles,' discontinuative.</p>  
<p>THEORY: The rather contradictory descriptions of this card's significance are well explained by its zodiacal position: <i>Air</i> on the <i>Third house</i>, which doubles the influence of 'air' and of the mercurial vibrations and effects. This card has the accent of the suit of wands. It must consequently denote: communication, reflection and all that comes from these. This needs little explanation.</p>  
<p>CONCLUSION: <i>Communication, instruction, reflexion, message, writing, postage and letters, superficial knowledge</i>,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_91"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 91</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>airiness, passing impressions, discontinuance, interruption, change</i>, perhaps a certain amount of <i>geniality, imprudence</i> also; neglect or want of proper attention; as to 'temerity' I should say only in so far as this means an <i>easy manner of overcoming obstacles, quick insight; effort, essay, trade</i> are correct. Mercury being the God of merchants, and thieves, this card may relate to <i>commerce, theft and loss</i>. "<i>The end of troubles</i>" is indeed well said, because this card gives the key for their solution and shows the way of escape.</p>
