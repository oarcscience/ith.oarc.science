<p>The Author of the "Handbook of Physical Science Restored" writes as follows:</p>  
<p>&sect; 1. God is an Eternal Being, an Infinite Unity, the Radical Principle of all things. His Essence is Infinite Light. His Power&#8212;Omnipotence; His Will&#8212;Perfect Goodness; His Wish&#8212;Absolute Reality. As we strive to think of Him, we plunge into the Abyss of Silence, of infinite Glory. &sect; 2. Many Sages have held that an Archetypal World existed long before the world of sense, when the Archetypal Light began to unfold Himself, and set forth in an Ideal World a counterpart of the Divine Mind. This belief is borne out by the words of Hermes Trismegistus, who says that when God changed His form, the universe was suddenly revealed and put forth in the Light of Actuality&#8212;this world being nothing but a visible Image of a Hidden God. This is what the Ancients meant when they said that Pallas leapt forth in divine perfection from the forehead of Jupiter, with the aid of Vulcan (or Divine Light). &sect; 3. The Eternal Father of All Things, being not less wise in the ordering, than powerful in the creation, of the world, has made the whole Universe to cohere by means of secret influences and mutual subjection and obedience, things below being analagous to things above, and <i>vice vers&acirc;;</i> so that both ends of the world are nevertheless united by a real bond of natural cohesion. Thus Hermes tells us that things below are the same as things above, and that things above are analagous to things below. &sect; 4. He who looks upon Nature as anything but the constant expression of God's Will, is an Atheist; every smallest part of the great universe is constantly vitalized and conserved by the Spirit of the Divine Master, and there is no life or existence apart from His consciously exerted Will. It was He that in the beginning moved upon the face of the waters, and brought forth the Actual out of the Chaos of Potentiality.</p>

<p>Psalm, civ. 5, 14.&#8212;Who laid the foundations of the earth that it should not be removed for ever.

<p>And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth: and it was so.</p>  
<p>And God made two lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; He made the stars also.</p>  
<p>And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,</p>

Great is God who created it, and bade it run its course Moreover, the Moon shines throughout the world, in due season, dividing months and years. It waxes and wanes in wonderful guise.

<p>And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</p>  
<p>And God blessed them, saying: Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.</p>  
<p>And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</p>  
<p>Psalm civ., 24.&#8212;O Lord, how manifold are Thy works: In wisdom hast Thou made them all: the earth is full of Thy riches. So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts. There go the ships; there is that leviathan whom thou hast made to take his pastime therein. These all wait on Thee, that Thou mayest give them their meat in due season.</p>  
<p align="center">TENTH CIRCLE.</p>

<p>And God made the beast of the earth, after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the, earth, after his kind; and God saw that it was good.</p>

<p>sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</p>  
<p>So God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him: male and female created He them.</p>  
<p>And God blessed them, and said unto them: Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</p>  
<p>And God said: Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.</p>  
<p>And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.</p>  
<p>And God saw everything that He had made, and behold it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</p>

<p>GEORGE RIPLEY, in the Prologue to his "Twelve Gates," says: O incomprehensible Light, glorious in Majesty, the brightness of whose rays obscures our lights: O Unity in the substance, and Trinity in the Godhead. Merciful purifier of souls, who dost exalt us from this troublesome vale of vanity to heaven. Infinite power and wisdom, unspeakable goodness, sustain and govern me day by day so that I may displease Thee in nothing. O Thou with whom are all treasures of wisdom and knowledge, out of whose infinite mind this universal frame sprang forth in a moment of time&#8212;when heaven and earth were made by Thy word, and all that is in them by the breath of Thy mouth&#8212;grant unto me grace to know Thy blessedness and Thy goodness. In no other way shall I come to the knowledge of the Blessed Stone.

Its strength is undiminished if it is changed into earth. Separate the earth from the fire, the subtle from the gross, gently, but with great skill. It rises from earth to heaven, and again descends to the earth, and receives the strength of things above and of things below. Thus you have the GLORY OF THE WHOLE WORLD, and all darkness will flee away from you. This is the strength of every strong thing: it overcomes every subtle thing, and penetrates all solids. IN THIS WAY WAS THE WORLD CREATED. These are the wonderful modifications, the manner of which I have described. Hence I am called Hermes Trismegistus, having the three parts of the wisdom of the whole world. I have now said all I have to say concerning the operation of the Sun.</p>
