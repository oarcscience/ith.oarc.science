<P>said to be found in the Valley of Ebron, after the Flood.</P>
<P>1<B>. </B>I speak not fiction, but what is certain and most true.</P>
<P>2<B>. </B>What is below is like that which is above, and what is above is like that which is below for performing the miracle of one thing.</P>
<P>3. And as all things were produced from One by the Mediation of One, so all things are produced from this One thing by adaptation.</P>
<P>4. Its father is the Sun, its mother was the Moon, the wind carried it in its belly, its nurse is the Earth.</P>
<P>5. It is the cause of all perfection throughout the whole world.</P>
<P>6. Its power is perfect if it be changed into the earth.</P>
<P>7. Separate the earth from the fire, the subtle from the gross, gently and with judgment.</P>
<P>8. It ascends from earth to heaven, and descends again to earth, thus you will possess the glory of the whole World and all obscurity will fly away.</P>
<P>9. This thing is the fortitude of all fortitude, because it overcomes all subtle things, and penetrates every solid thing.</P>

<P>10.<B> </B>Thus were all things created.</P>
<P>11. Thence proceed wonderful adaptations which are produced in this way.</P>
<P>12.<B> </B>Therefore am I called Hermes Trismegistus, possessing the three parts of the philosophy of the whole World.</P>
<P>13.<B> </B>What I had to say concerning the operation of the Sun is complete.</P>
