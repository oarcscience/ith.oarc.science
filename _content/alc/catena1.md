## Of the Generation of things, Part I

  

### Chapter 1 What Nature is. 

Nature comprehends the visible and invisible Creatures of the Whole
universe. What we call Nature especially, is the universal fire or Anima
Mundi, filling the whole system of the Universe, and therefore is a
Universal Agent, omnipresent, and endowed with an unerring instinct, and
manifests itself in fire and Light. It is the First creature of Divine
Omnipotence.  
  

### Chapter 2 How all things proceed therefrom. 

Thus God created first this invisible fire and endowed it with an
unerring Instinct and a Capacity to manifest itself in 3 Principles.  
1. In its Original most Universal state it is perfectly invisible,
immaterial, cold and occupies no space, in this tranquil state it is of
no use to us, yet in this unmoved state it is omnipresent.  
2. In its second state it is manifested by motion or agitation into
light. In this state it was separated out of the Chaos, when God said,
"Let there be Light." Yet it is still cold. When gently moved or
agitated, it manifests warmth and Heat, as in the case in all Frictions
and in Fermentation of moist things.  
3. When collected in a sufficient quantity, and violently agitated it is
manifested into burning fire. This continues burning as long as it is
agitated, and has a fit subject to act upon; when that fails, it returns
to its first state of tranquil Universality. In the character of burning
fire it manifests Light and Heat. Thus,  
(a) we say in its first most Universal state it is perfectly invisible
and immaterial.  
(b) In its second state of manifestation it is visible in Light, but
remains cold and immaterial.  
(c) In its third state of Heat and burning fire it is visible, hot or
burning, and becomes somewhat material as it occupies Room or Space
whilst in this State.  
You have seen how 3 distinct powers of the Universal Spirit, but it
possesses still more and even some inconceivable powers.  
We have told you that the Universal spirit endowed with an unerring
Instinct, working by the most simple and nearest way, it has, also,
besides its already mentioned conspicuous qualities, two occult powers,
viz: attracting and repulsing, and these two powers are inconceivably
great!  
We see various instances of it in Thunder and Lightning, in Earthquakes,
Hurricanes and in the surprising effects of Gunpowder.  
When God created this Universal fire, He gave it a power to become
material, that is to become Vapour, Humidity, water and earth, although
that fire in its own Universal Nature, is, and remains centrally the
same. Thus you see the Beginning of the 4 Elements, viz  
(1) burning fire; Vapour or Humidity mixed with Cold fire constitutes
atmospheric air,  
(2) air, which still more condensed becomes water,  
(3) and water inspissated becomes earth.  
Originally it was but one Element Fire.  
Thus the Universal fire became a Vapour of immense Extent, which by
further inspissation became chaotic water, and out of this Chaotic Water
the Creator separated the Light, that is: separated the Universal
invisible fire into Light. Thus we see here that Universal, at first
invisible fire manifested in two Principles, Light and Humidity!  
Therefore out of Light and water, God has created all Things.  
Water was the first condensation or corporification of the Universal
fire, which water nevertheless in its center was, and remains fire, full
of life and activity, and the more so, as it was assisted by its Equal,
the Light, separated out of it, as much as was necessary for the
creating of all immaterial and material Beings, and in success of time
for their maintenance.  
Of the separated Light we have spoken before, we have now to consider
its first body Humidity or water. This water differs it regard to
Rarefaction or Density; if Rarefied to a certain Degree it constitutes
air, that is fire predominating above water, but if condensed to a
degree it becomes Humid water, or Humidity predominating above fire.
Nevertheless, in both, that is in their Center lays concealed fire or
the Universal spirit.  
As soon as the air gets deprived of its Universal fire, which animates
it and renders it elastic, it becomes immediately putrid, and thereby
declines lower down, becomes Humidity, mud, earth and immoveable; it is
the same case with water when deprived of fire, or of animated air, it
becomes putride, condenses still further and becomes earth,
immoveable.  
God has ordained it so that the Universal spirit by means of Humidity
should work all things, because Humidity mixes easily with everything,
by means of which the spirit can soften, penetrate, generate. destroy
and regenerate all things.  
Thus Humidity or water is the Body, the Vehicle and Tool, but the spirit
or fire is the Operator, the Universal Agent and fabricator of all
Natural Things.  
This universal fire fills that immense space in the Universe between the
heavenly bodies. and as it has a power to become material, it generates
a subtil vapour or invisible most subtil Humidity, its first passive
principle: It causes therein a gentle Reaction, and a general, gentle,
most subtil Fermentation takes place Universally, and by this Reaction
the Universal Acid is everywhere generated, which we can deem nothing
else than a most subtil incorporeal Nitre Spiritus Mundi, outwardly cold
and inwardly fire.  
Thus this Spiritual incorporeal Nitre or Universal Acid; we deem the
second invisible change of the Universal fire, generated out of chaotic
invisible Humidity: and as this approaches the atmospheres of the
heavenly bodies, it becomes gradually more and more material, until it
meets an alcaline passive principle wherein it fixes itself and forms
Native nitre, so that from Spiritus Mundi, it becomes nitre.  
Thus we say, not without good reason, that the Solar Rays of Light, are
nothing else but a most subtil spiritual Spiritual Mundi, which
gradually becomes more and more nitreous, as it approaches the Earth,
but Sea Salt in the Ocean; animating the atmosphere with fire or Life,
and thereby giving elasticity to the air, and Life and preservation to
the water. From this, every man of common understanding may learn what
Nature is, and its origin.  
We see that between the Firmament and our Earth continual Vapours,
Clouds, and Fogs, which ascend like a transpiration of the Earth, and
are sublimed upwards by the Central heat of the Earth. This Chaotic
water and Vapours, contain, and are the First Matter of all Things, and
although this appears very simple before our Eyes, yet it is two-fold,
as it contains fire and Humidity, the Invisible in the Visible, the fire
or spirit is the Agent, and the water the Patient.  
Whosoever wishes to arrive at the Fountain of Secret Wisdom, let him
mind this well; and let him go with this Central Point of Truth to the
circumference, and for ever imprint in his memory: that from fire and
water, or spirit enclosed in Humidity all things in the World are
generated, preserved, destroyed and regenerated.  
Whosoever comprehends this well will find no difficulty in analising
Natural things as he may easily volatilize fixt, and fix the volatile: a
stinking subject he may convert into a pleasant smelling one, out of
poison he can make a salutary Medicine because he knows that all things
proceed from one Root; and return to that Root: The distinction is
external and regards only the modification of the Matter, which is more
or less digested or fixt. Therefore the Philosophers say that their
Matter is in all Things, yet they have selected such Subjects wherein
the Universal spirit is more abundantly contained and more concentrated,
and easer to be obtained; otherwise that spirit is All in All.  
  

### Chapter 3 How all things are further generated. 

We have demonstrated that the primordial Vapour, or that fire and water,
are after God, the First Matter of all Things. This two-fold Vapour by
inspissation is become water and this water by the action of the
invisible spirit therein diffused, has begun to ferment and then to
generate Matter. At first, this water was perfectly subtil and pure, but
by means of the action of the inward spirit, it becomes turbid, smelled
badly and thus generated Earth. It was divided into various parts. into
a Spiritual, most subtil, into a half or less subtil, into a half
corporeal, and into a Body. At first it was 1 and 2, -- now it is 1, 2,
and 3, likewise 4 and 5.  
It was 1, as a simple Humidity;  
2, as a water containing a spirit;  
3, when it was separated into volatile, half fixt, and fixt, that is,
chemically speaking -- into Volatil, Acetum and Alcali; Anima, spirit,
Corpus;  
4, when it was divided into the four so-called Elements, fire, air,
water, earth;  
5, when it is by Art, assisted by Nature, formed into an indestructible
fiery Quintessence, thus \[unidentified symbol\].  
When the water has attained to its term of putrefaction, we may separate
one subtil after another; the most subtil will certainly ascend before
the less subtil, and so one principle after another until the least
volatile comes last.  
God had ordained that the different modifications of the Universal
spirit, in the four Elements, should continually generate and produce a
Universal General Sperm, for that reason God has given to each
individual thing its Agent and Patient, in order to cause a Reaction;
This we see by the evaporation of numberless Subjects, who send forth
whatever Humidity then have more than is necessary. This evaporation
when from above is called Influence, but when from things here below it
is called Effluvium.  
God has given each Individual its particular Sperm. which however all
depends on the Universal Sperm, as their Ruler and Conductor.  
  

### Chapter 4 How the Universal Sperm is generated by the four Elements 

After God had divided or corporified the Anima or Spirit Mundi, the
simple Chaos into four Elements. or predominating, leading principles;
He called to them "increase and multiply"; The Heavens and the Air, both
animated by the Universal fire are the Father, the Male, the Agent or
Operating principles. Water and earth are the Mother, the Female or
Passive principle. These four are nevertheless only two, fire and water;
They are forced to engender continually a regenerated Chaotic water or
primordial Chaos out of their Center, for the generation, preservation,
destruction and regeneration of all Things, and this will continue until
it pleases God to Calcine and regenerate the whole Earth!  
These four so-called Elements, which must fabricate the Universal Sperm
or regenerate the Chaos, when one Extream is considered towards the
other, seem quite contrary, and indeed as contraries they cannot effect
any good; yet when they meet orderly, they are fully capable to execute
that what God has ordained them for.  
It is a natural and philosophical Axiom "Non transire posse abuno
Extremo ad alterum absque medio," -- that is: It is impossible to
proceed from one Extream to another Extream without a Medium. This Axiom
every Artist ought to mind, thousands err because they do not observe
this Truth.  
Fire cannot become water without air, and earth cannot become air
without water . If you would unite fire, as being extreamly volatile and
subtil, with the earth, which is corporeal and fixt, you will never be
able to do it; because the most Volatile will forsake the fixt and
return to its Chaos. This is so in all Natural Things, that the most
Volatile principle, cannot unite with the most fixt without its proper
medium. An Artist ought to observe this constantly that he may not lose
his time, his Matter, and Expenses.  
Therefore if you want to unite Heaven or fire with the earth, or convert
fire into earth, unite it first with its nearest volatile medium and
they will unite immediately, when that is done, give them the water, as
a medium between air and earth, and they will also unite; then add the
earth, and thus you may unite fire with earth and fix it therein; and so
vice versa turn the earth into water with water, then convert it into
air, and the air into fire by means of air.  
The Heaven or fire is extreamly subtil, the air is also subtil, but one
degree more corporeal than the fire; water is again a degree more
corporeal than the air, and the earth is a degree more corporeal than
the water. Thus we must proceed as Nature does, and we may then obtain a
Quintessentificated Operation, if we do not mind this, we can do little
or nothing.  
Nature has its different degrees of subtilty, and mixes the most subtil
fire with the less subtil, and that with the least subtil.  
When they are united, they influence into the most subtil water, then
into the less subtil, and into the grossest. Then it mixes gradually
with the most subtil earth, with the less and least subtil, until it
becomes Rocks and Stones.  
In a chemical Anatomy we see how the most subtil comes over first, and
how Nature regulates her Operations, and does not confound one principle
with another, but lets go the most Volatile and most subtil first, and
then the next less Volatile, and so on etc. for Example:  
Take an earth out of a Field or Meadow or what Earth you please, pour
Water upon it so as to dilate your Earth well, then let it stand a few
days and you will find that the coarse heavy earth settles at the bottom
of the Vessel, you must stir it 3 or 4 times a day. The water will in
the meantime dissolve the most subtil earth which is its salt, this does
unite with the water, as being a Virgin earth.  
As soon as this salt, or Virgin earth is extracted out of the common
earth, the water cannot dissolve it any further.  
Now you must distil this water containing the salt, into a spiritual
water, and you must cohobate so often until all the salt has come over
with the water.  
This water now has the power to dissolve again the next subtil earth,
which can like the first salt be distilled over as a spiritual water.  
With this Water you may proceed in dissolving more of the remaining
earth, until by distillations and cohobations, you have dissolved the
whole quantity and volatilised it into a spiritual water; This is a
tedious Operation but of great moment: In the same manner Nature
operates by dissolving and coagulating, until the Universal Sperm of all
Things is generated, which is universal seed.  
The Artist must observe that Nature proceeds gradually and regularly.
and observes time weight, and measure, he must transpose the External
into the Internal and Heavenly, and he will obtain more and more
knowledge.  
  

### Chapter 5 In what manner the divided Chaotic water is regenerated and becomes the Universal and General Sperm of all Things, called Anima or Spiritus Mundi. 

The 4 so-called Elements have been separated out of the Chaos, but they
proceed all from one. The form is but one, and the Matter is but one.
The form is fire, and the Matter is water.  
The difference consists in their external appearance, by Fermentation
fire becomes air, and air becomes water, and water is become earth; But
when fire is fixed by Art or by Nature it becomes earth, and when the
earth is volatilised by water it becomes air and fire.  
Because one Element can be converted into the other, if this was not
true they would differ centrally, but they do not. The Chaos which
produced these Elements was in the beginning fire and water only, these
two have been divided into four b a further volatilisation and
Inspissation: By volatilisatian extennation or rerefaction, Humidity
becomes air animated by fire, but by condensation in Inspissation of
that Primordial Humidity the Earth has been formed with the fire turned
downwards, toward the Center of the Earth. The Hieroglyphic characters
of the Elements explain their nature exactly.  
There is not a Subject under the Heavens, whether liquid or dry which
does not contain this Universal fire, and Primordial Humidity. The first
is called Innate Heat, -- the last is called Radical Humidity.  
The Universal fire becomes Humidity externally, but remained fire
internally; being internally extreamly spiritual and volatile, it was of
course extreamly active and moveable, and by that primitive mobility,
excited warmth and fermentation and by that fermentation the Universal
vinegar was, and is continually generated, and when this meets with a
proper Body, whether in water or in the earth the Universal Sperm
becomes visible and Corporeal, but whilst it is only a Vapour in the
atmosphere, it is then the Universal Astral and incorporeal Sperm. This
is the influence we receive from Heaven by means of the Air.  
The Heavens give their influence, so does the Air, Water and Earth, and
with united efforts they fabricate continually the Universal Sperm of
the World.  
  

### Chapter 6 Of the Heavens and their Influence. 

Heaven, after the separation of the Chaos, is the first principle, and
became visible in Light: It is the most subtil and the highest, as well
as the most universal, when it generated Humidity it became a most
subtil Vapour, pure and extreamly Volatile, for that reason occupies the
highest Station, or the remotest from the atmospheres of the heavenly
Bodies.  
This most subtil principle is full of Life and the most active for which
reason we call Heaven the first Agent, the Male Sperm the Soul, a subtle
air, a subtil water, a volatile earth.  
Heaven and air have their influence not upwards, but downwards, towards
water and earth, but earth and water ascends upwards to meet them. They
mix thus in the state of vapours in order to fabricate the Chaotic
regenerated, and impregnated water or the Universal, Semi-material
Sperma Mundi. As soon as the air is impregnated and animated with
Heaven, it communicates immediately with water and earth to impregnate
them also.  
This communication is done in a moment, as the Elements are gradually
prepared to meet and mix with each other, by a continual circulation.
There is no doubt but our atmosphere is continually loaded with Vapours,
exhalations and clouds for the sake of communication of the Elements; as
soon as these Vapours become condensed into Rain, Dew, Snow or Hail and
fall down that same moment the volatilisations and exhalations of water
and earth take place and are ready to succeed and meet those, which come
down; so that there can never be no want of generation of such Vapours,
which when sufficiently dilated or extended constitute our common air,
which is more or less pure according as it is more or less animated by
Heaven or fire.  
The Heavens receive the ascending Vapours, which as they recede from the
atmosphere become more and more subtil and spiritual until they are
actually returned to their first Universal state of Ether or Spiritus
Mundi. The atmospheric air also receives continually the volatilised
water and succeeding Vapours, until it is satiated and overloaded, when
the superflous Humidity is forced down again in Dew, Rain, Hail, Snow.  
Thus fire and air come down into the Waters and impregnate them; the
Waters dispose their thickest part and give it to the Earth; the Earth
thereby becomes overloaded or saturated, which superfluity of earth and
water is again volatised and sublimed upwards by the fire, inverted fire
or Central Heat, into Vapours, which ascension and descension God has
implanted into the Universal fire, as the Great and only Agent of
nature, or rather Nature herself which causes this perpetual circulation
by its attracting and repulsing power, as we have demonstrated in the
Second Chapter.  
The Lover of Natural Knowledge may clearly learn here how the Effluvium
of one Element becomes the food and nourishment of the others, until
converted therein; the same takes place with us and our food, as, for
instance, we eat Bread and drink Wine, we discharge the superfluities of
our food, which are used for manure on the land; seed is sown therein
and out of such superfluities grows again our food.  
A Tree looses its leaves during Winter, the leaves fall to the Root,
where they putrify and become humidity which penetrates to the Root and
feeds the Tree again.  
Observe this well and you will fully comprehend the Superius and
Inferious of Hermes, and our Catena Homeri or Platonic Ring. Thus you
will see a continual transmutation of Matter, that is a conditional
change or modification, whilst the inward central fire of Nature remains
always the same, as it was in the beginning. All things were water at
first, and return to water . Apply this throughout our Book, which is no
small step towards out Art.  
  

### Chapter 7 Of the Atmosphere or air, and its Influence. 

Air is the second principle after the separation of the Chaos, and is
the Vehicle or Instrument of the first i.e. fire; We mean here the
genuine animated air. This we call Male, Manly, Sperm, and first
Operator in all Things.  
The Heavens or fire is the Anima and Life whilst the air or extenuated,
rarefied Humidity is the spirit and Receptacle of the Soul and Principle
of Life, and consequently animated fire ought to be named Spiritus
Vitalis Macrocosmi, or the Vital Spirit of the Earth which we inhabit.  
Air is a most subtil humid vapour or rarefied water wherein fire dwells
abundantly. This is more corporeal than the Ether beyond the Atmosphere,
which Ether is totally unfit for Inspiration, as being too subtil to
fill the air vesicles in the lungs of animals: Air being the genuine
Medium between fire and water, as it partakes of both, is therefore
capable to receive the most subtil celestial fiery influences as well as
the sublimed vapours from below, and by a continual motion or
circulation, more and more vapours are converted into air, and more and
more of such air becomes animated by fire, and as soon as it is
saturated, the superflous humidity is condensed again and comes down in
the character of animated water, such is Rain, Dew, Hail, and Snow.  
By this you see that atmospheric air is the first Medium to unite fire
with water and earth, and without it the Heavens could never communicate
with water and earth.  
Thus air becomes vapour and water, and the thicker the water gets, the
better it mixes with the Earth, as on the contrary the Earth by
Subtilisation by means of water is again converted into air, Nature
operating these perpetual changes and conversions from one extream to
the other: When they unite in Vapours they fabricate the Universal Sperm
of the World Spiritus Mundi, which is partly resolved in Dew and Rain
etc. and partly remains in the air for the sake of animation; the
atmospheric animated Waters fall down upon the Earth, as the Receptacle
of all Celestial virtues, and fertilises it, for the growth and
nourishment of Animals, Vegetables and Minerals. The Earth itself is a
condensed or fixed Heaven, and Heaven is a volatilised earth, air is a
rarefied water, and water is condensed air. We have here to note that
one Element differs from the other only in this, that the One is
volatile, the Other fixed, the one is fluid or dissolved, the Other is
condensed or coagulated, and yet every one is and remains centrally and
inwardly what they all were at first, -- i.e. prima materia or fire;
Lastly, the Air may be called Renes, or the Kidneys of the Macrocosm,
because in the air is chiefly found the conflux of all radical
substantial. macrocosmical fluids, and the pure Extract of Essence of
the World does meet there, where that ancient primordial Chaos is daily
and hourly generated and regenerated for generation, preservation,
destruction and regeneration of all Natural Things.  
What are Dew, Rain, Snow, or Hail else but a regenerated Chaos? Out of
which Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals receive part of the vivifying
principle and nourishment: and all this is generated in the Air.  
  

### Chaper 8 Of Water and its Effluvium 

Water and earth belong together, as fire and air do, nay, all four stand
in need of each other; the earth wants water, and fire cannot do without
air; air without or deprived of fire becomes a putrid humidity, and
water without animated air becomes mud and earth.  
Water is the third principle, but the first passive Element, the Female
Sperm and Menstrum of the Macrocosm, which does the Office of conveying
food and nourishment to all Sublunary Creatures, and is, with the Earth,
the Mother of all Things. Water is condensed air and a fluid earth.
Water is a Medium between air and earth.  
As soon as fire is become air, and air been converted into water, Dew,
Rain, or Snow, they fall down on the inferior grosser waters and earth
and mix therewith, begin to ferment by means of the primogenial
implanted spirit or fire, and one Element operates into the other, until
they have produced their Fruit from convenient Matrixes.  
Here the Artist may learn Wisdom from Nature, which is not satisfied
with one Medium of Union, viz: air to convert fire into earth, but makes
use of water also. Thus the Artist must follow Nature, if he wants to
unite and fix his principles together; Let him look for a Medium of
Union, which is easily found; and if one Medium is not enough, let him
employ two, and if two prove inadequate, let him take three, but
homogenials and not heterogenials, as minerals agree with minerals,
vegetables with vegetables etc. Minerals agree also with Vegetables, and
Vegetables with Animals, as the Vegetables stand between Animals and
Minerals.  
The difference between them all is but external, not central, as they
proceed originally all from one and the same Universal spirit;  
Minerals are fixt Vegetables, Vegetables are Volatile Minerals, and one
kingdom is transmutable into the other, in regard to its internal
qualities.  
Men and Beasts make use of Vegetables for food, and by their inward
nature, they change those Vegetables into flesh and Blood; now when man
and beasts die, they are buried underground, and Vegetables are again
produced, which receive by means of their fibres and roots mineral
Vapours, which are thus converted again into Vegetables.  
This is the true Pythagorean Metempsychosis. Vegetables again. when they
putrefy, assume a nitreous saline nature which is dissolved by rain and
carried downwards through the pores, into the earth, or into the Sea. if
near hand, from whence it ascends again as a mineral vapour, and thus
Vegetables are frequently changed into Minerals, as well as into
Animals, although more frequently into animals. Heaven and Air are Male
Sperm, water is the Female Sperm and Menstrum, the Earth is the Womb or
Matrix, wherein the two first, by means of the third operate every
Generation.  
  

### Chapter 9 Of the Earth and its Effluvium. 

Earth is the fourth and last principle of the Chaos. It is the second
passive Element, the Matrix, and Mother of all sublinary Creatures;
earth is a coagulated fixt Heaven a coagulated fixt water, and condensed
air. The Center and Receptacle of all the heavenly Influences and of the
Universal Sperm, which takes here a Body as well as in the Ocean.  
Heaven by its extream subtility, is of all Elements the most moveable
and omnipresent; its own motion, on account of its subtility is
imperceptible, although visible in Light; This Universal fire is never
idle, but perpetually active, pervading all things, although its action
is generally imperceptible. This is the original cause of all Motion in
Nature it moves the most subtil Air on the outward superficies of the
atmospheres of the opaque celestial Bodies. This outward subtil air set
in Motion, moves the next towards the region of Clouds and Vapours, yet
as the atmospheres grow gradually thicker, i.e. more loaded with
Vapours, the nearer to Sea and Land, the Motion is successively and
gradually slower.  
That the air is moved by the Ether or fire, is observable on account of
the constant motion of the atmosphere; that Air set in Motion moves the
Waters is well known to those who navigate the Seas and Rivers. That
Water moves the Earth appears by the Sand, Mud and Stones which the
Waters move continually from one place to the other. Here the Water
carries off, and in other places accumulates Sand and whole Shores: now
every Motion manifests warmth of the omnipresent cold, Universal fire,
where it be perceptible or imperceptible as this depends on
circumstances; In living Animals this warmth occasioned by moving the
omnipresent fire is perceptible enough, whilst that same Motion is
imperceptible in Vegetables and in Minerals. All Life proceeds from a
Motion of the Universal fire, as a total privation of action and warmth
extinguishes Life. From this let the Student collect that there exists a
perceptible and imperceptible warmth.  
This we tell you because in all the Elements exist Innate Heat, which is
sometimes observable at other times not, this is not always dependent on
the collected Rays of Light, nor on the Central Heat of the Earth.  
Every Subject under the Sun, although invisibly small contains Life or
fire, and of course the four Elements. Now if every Subject contains
Heaven or fire, so every Subject has a Motion, whether visible and
perceptible or not, yet there is a Motion in it.  
Heaven never rests: it must have a Motion, let it proceed from what
means it will; and although this principle may seem to be inactive or at
rest, yet it has its invisible influences, virtues, and powers.  
For instance, a plant, root, or herb, ore or mineral tore from the Spot
where it grew, seems to be dead, because it is hindered from growing to
a further perfection; But as Heaven is within which is never at rest, it
still continues to show its powers and virtues, when that plant or ore
is rendered medicinal.  
The Lover of Natural Truths sees here, from whence each Concrete derives
its power, viz. from the implanted Heaven within as from without, from
its perpetual Motion, warmth and heat. Therefore you will look in vain
for a Subject big, or even so small which is deprived of Life, that is
of Heaven air, water and earth. It stands to reason that the Children
resemble Father and Mother, now as all Things did proceed from the
Primeval Chaos, they must partake of the same properties. This property
was fire and Humidity, but fire is the mover.  
Thus fire or the spirit is diffused through the whole system of Nature,
so that the meanest drop of water, or the smallest atom of Sand or Earth
is filled with that Universal spirit.  
Observe here that the whole difference of Things consists only in
volatility or fixity; that is: volatility and fixity causes the changes
and different modulations of Matter, and the whole scope of Nature is to
corporify and fix Heaven, in order to become useful and salutary; which,
Heaven could not effect if it were not by the gradual Mediums of
Vapours, as it must communicate with the Earth by means of air and
water. God has ordained it wisely, that Heaven must become corporeal and
be converted into all the Elements, as vice versa, the inferior Elements
are by subtilisation converted into air and fire or Heaven, in order to
be reimpregnated and renewed by the Celestial Influences, for the sake
of generation, preservation, destruction, and regeneration of all
Things. We have explained to you how Vapours are converted into air and
air into fire, we will now examine the nature of these Vapours.  
We have told you that there exists in the Earth an Innate Heat, which we
believe to be the strongest in the Center of the Earth, by reason of its
swift motion. This Celestial Heat causes a continual transpiration and
sublimation of Vapours; such Vapours are Dews and Fogs; these Vapours
are two-fold and four-fold. Two-fold because they consist of water and
earth, fourfold as they contain the 4 Elements, which four Elements
cannot do without each others assistance; that I call these Vapours
water and earth is, because they contain those two Elements volatilised
and subtilised, and if they ascend they are still further subtilised and
converted into air and fire or Heaven.  
Such Vapours have been water will be easily admitted, but that they also
contain a subtilised earth, may perhaps be doubted; but note, that I
have said before, that one Element is the conductor of the other, and
that one Element dissolves and subtilises the other.  
Fire dissolves and subtilises air, air dissolves and subtilises water,
water dissolves and subtilises and mollifies the earth, vice versa, the
earth condenses the water, water condenses air, air condenses or
corporifies Heaven or fire, by which means air becomes animated, as we
have explained before, and becomes this Spiritus Mundi.  
Thus one Element is the others Magnet, solvent, volatilising,
condensing, coagulating and fixing principles. You are to note here that
Nature has its degrees of Volatility and Fixity; as for instance, that
part of fire which is nearest to the atmosphere is not so highly pure or
subtil, as that which is a thousand leagues remote from it: In the same
manner, the highest atmospheric air is purer, colder and more subtil as
well as dryer than that air near us, which we breathe. The superfluities
of the water is also lighter, more aerial and more subtil than the thick
slimy ground waters, which settle on pebbles. stones corals, and
covering them with a slime or subtil mud.  
The Earth has also its degrees of subtility and fixity: We have therein
earth juices, sulphurs, bituminous substances, such as the pitcoal,
clays, loams, minerals, ores and metals, rocks, stones, and flints, and
the precious gems of a wonderful fixity.  
The most volatile earth is mollified and dissolved by water, further
volatilised into air and fire.  
Vice Versa the lowest fire sooner mixes and corporifies itself with the
air, than the remote, whilst the lowest atmospheric air sooner mixes
with, and becomes water, than the pure and highest air, the Inferior
slimy ground waters become earth sooner than the superficial lighter
waters.  
The Volatile soluble Earth, in particular its Virgin earth, i.e., its
salt is sooner dissolved by water than a pebble or Sand. The volatile
water is sooner converted into the lower air than the grownd waters can
possibly be.  
If you understand us right, we shew you here the first beginning of
Nature, and the true First Matter. As the 4 Elements proceed from the
primordial Vapours, they are forced to generate continually such a
Vapour, of the very selfsame principles and substances, which Vapour is
converted by Nature into a Chaotic water, and falls down in Showers of
Rain.  
In this Chaotic water is invisibly contained the Universal Sperm for the
generation, preservation, destruction and regeneration of all Things.  
Now we have treated of the regeneration of the Chaos or Universal
Vapours: we shall further show you its power and virtue so that you may
touch it with your hands, as well as see it with your eyes.  
  

### Chapter 10 Discovery of the genuine Universal Sperm in the regenerated Chaos, the corporified Animal or Spiritus Mundi. 

We have demonstrated how fire water air earth be proceed from the first
Chaotic Waters, and how they produce the Universal Sperm, and how they
continually regenerate the Chaotic waters for generation, preservation
and Regeneration of all Things. This Universal Sperm is generated by
condensation and evaporation of Vapours, which are circulated in the
great Alembic of the Air, until they are sufficiently impregnated or
animated by fire, when they are again condensed and resolved into
water.  
This Chaotic Waters are commonly called Dew, Rain, Showers, Hail, Snow:
But really and truly it is the true regenerated Chaos, the genuine
spirit and Anima Mundi animates it, who generates, preserves, kills, and
regenerates all sublunary Creatures agreeably to their original form, by
means of their Seed or Sperm, and this Anima Mundi is Nature truly.  
Now to prove that this Dew. Rain, Hail. or Snow is actually the
regenerated Chaos, containing the Universal Sperm and spirit Mundi we
must show you that they were generated first out of the primordial
Chaos. We must also show, nay, we have done it before, that our
regenerated Chaos contains the four Elements, and if it contains them,
it must of course possess all what the four Elements contain.  
We say therefore as a fundamental truth, that everything can be resolved
and must return to that; what it was at first; and everything must be
resolved and be returned to its first origin by that self-same principle
by which it was made or generated naturally. The Elements originate from
Vapour and fire, and they return to Vapour, that is Water, and from
thence to fire. They proceed from fire and humidity, and by fire and
humidity they return to their first origin.  
Now that Dew and Rain is fire and water, or such a regenerated Chaos as
the first Chaos was, is proved by its visible effects, better known to
Country-men and Gardeners than to Citizens: Chemical Anatomy
demonstrates visibly that the four Elements are contained in Dew and
Rain water.  
Daily experience confirms it, that by the effects of those waters every
Plant prospers and grows, Animals cannot do without it, and minerals and
metals are generated by their inward fiery principle, as we shall show
hereafter. Now let us examine this Universal Sperm, or regenerated
Chaotic water by Chemical Anatomy. Take a quantity of Dew, Rain, Snow or
Hail, which you like; but the most expeditious way is if you take Rain
water from a thundershower, receive it into clean glazed earthen
Vessels, and filter it in order to separate the dirt from it which
intermixes from the Roofs of Houses, and you will after filtration, have
a clear crystalline water, of no particular taste, in fact a fine clear
water, fit to be used like any other water.  
Place this collected water in a warm garret, where neither Sun nor Moon
can shine upon it, cover the Vessels with a Linen Cloth, to prevent the
dust getting into it.  
Let it stand a month unmoved, and if the place is warm enough, you will
by this time perceive an alteration in the water, because this water
begins by the power of the implanted fire or spirit grow warm although
imperceptibly and to break; it begins to ferment and putrefy and
acquires a bad smell, and you will observe that it becomes turbid,
although it was perfectly clear at first, and a brown spongy earth
ascends swimming at the top, which increases daily and from its weight
falls to the bottom.  
Here you see a separation, occasioned by the ingrafted spirit of the
gross from the subtil.  
The separated earth is brown, spongy or like wool slimy and slippery,
and this slimy earth is the Universal Gur of Nature.  
Here the Artists may observe two things viz. water and earth, which
conceal fire and air.  
Here the air animated by the fire is extended in the water. Now you have
two passive Elements water and earth. In the beginning you had only a
volatile water but by a gentle putrefaction in a warm place you have
manifested the earth also. Fire and air we must look for in another
way.  
When you see now your Rain water in that state of putrefaction that the
slimy Earth is separated and falls to the bottom. then stir it up with a
clean wooden handle.  
  
**Separation and Distillation**  
Now pour your troubled water and earth in that state of putrefaction
into a large Glass Body, which place in an earthenware pot, fixed into a
charcoal distilling furnace, apply a large alembic and receiver and
light your fire, which keep so gentle that only the stream or vapours
arise. Let this all come over first as a pure water, which contains
animated air, that is air and fire. Distil no more of the very volatile
water over; than what will go with the gentlest degree of Heat, whilst
the Subject in the body only vapours away but must not be suffered to
boil, in this manner you vapour over about the fourth part of the whole,
or less.  
Take the receiver off with this very volatile water, this water the more
so, if you afterwards rectify it per se over a steam bath is more
luminous and clearer than common distilled water, which is a proof that
it contains much air and fire.  
Now apply another receiver and continue the distillation, raising your
heat sufficiently, so as to cause the thickish water in the Glass Body
to boil and in this manner you must distil all the water over, which
will appear like water and in drops in the Alembic; continue the
distillation until it remains in the body like melted Honey and looks
Brown, but beware of distilling until it remains dry, because you would
burn the young and tender Virgin earth in the bottom of the Vessel,
which is not yet fixt. Take the distilled water away and put it by as
the Element water.  
The Honey-like Matter, or the moist earth remaining in the Glass body,
take out cleanly and put it into a china basin and set it in the Sun to
evaporate until it is perfectly dry; then grind it in a Glass Mortar to
a subtil earth. Now you have separated the Elements out of your Chaos.  
Now it remains to be proved that they are truly Elements or else it must
be false what I have written, that all sublunary subjects proceed from
them. To produce heavenly subjects out of this Chaos, or meteors, as
this water itself is a meteorical production, let no one undertake; but
we will demonstrate that Animals. Vegetables and Minerals may, and can
be generated, and that is what we pretend and no further.  
  
**To generate Minerals**  
Take your dried earth put it into a glass Body and humect it a little
with a few drops of your Dist: water, but not with the Element air and
fire, and put the Body in a warm room facing the South, but let not the
Sun's Rays shine upon the Body; after your earth is dry, humect or
imbibe it again with the Element water. then set it to dry, and this
humecting and drying you may repeat several times every day and continue
so doing during the whole Summer, and you can mineralise the whole
Earth. You will find by your inbibitions and exsiccations, that the
Earth becomes more ponderous and sandy.  
NB. the Glass Body must be covered with paper only to keep the dust out,
as there must be left access of air. As soon as you perceive that the
earth is become sandy, you may know that it is mineralised, this sandy
earth is neither Animal nor Vegetable, consequently Mineral. If you have
a few ounces of this earth, try it as Glauber tries the sun containing
Sands and you will find a grain or two of sun and moon.  
  
**To produce Vegetables out of your Earth.**  
Take your before mentioned earth dried in the Sun. put it into a Glass
Body, make a mixture of two parts of water and one part of air (which
you rectified in the beginning) with this humect or unbibe your earth as
the gardeners do, by sprinkling only, not too wet, not too dry, place
your Body (open) on the air not so that the Sun can shine upon it, and
you will find several Vegetables productions spring up in a few weeks,
although you have sown no Seed.  
If you like to produce Animals. Take your before mentioned dried and
powdered earth, pour first together, one part of water, and three parts
of air, with this mixture humect your earth so copiously that it may
become like liquid or melted Honey, place the Glass body which contains
this mixture in the Air where it is warm, the Sun may shine on it but
not too hot, nor at the Meridian, and the Glass is left open.  
You will perceive that in a few days, there will be different kinds of
small vermine, in the thick water ; when the earth diminishes and dries
up you must humect it again, so that it may remain of the same
consistence like Honey or Syrup, as before; and you will perceive that
the first small vermine will die and loose themselves, and others will
be produced who will feed on their putrefaction and become larger and
more in number.  
I could reveal here something, but as it would be abused by profligate
men, I am obliged to be silent.  
You may be convinced by these experiments that our water or regenerated
Chaos, Rain water, or Dew, or Snow is, and contains the Mundi and
Universal Sperm, out of which, all things were, and are generated. It
appears from this that this water and Earth are endowed with the
principle of fertility for the three departments of Nature, as all
things are produced thereof.  
Few there are that know the secret powers of these things, and what it
is that causes and gives fertility!  
It is a spirit or fire, but as a volatile unembodied spirit, he can
effect nothing in natural productions.  
All what is to be serviceable in visible Bodies, must be, or become
corporeal with them, it must become visible and palpable: therefore this
great and wonderful Universal spirit must take a visible and palpable
Body, as well as the Animal and Vegetable Sperm is visible and palpable.
Few know this although they handle it often enough.  
This corporified Anima Mundi or Universal Sperm according to its origin
is but little known, although it may be got in great quantity. The cause
of this obscurity is that it bears a different name from what it ought
to have. According to its root and origin it ought to be called the
Sperm of the Macrocosm, the Sperm of the World, the cause of Fertility.
This title belongs to it as it is the concentrated corporified Sperm,
and spirit Mundi in a transparent visible crystalline Body, a dry water,
which does not wet the hands, an earth, a fiery pure earth, full of
Light and fire also full of cold, like ice, a coagulated or congealed
fire, a condensed and animated air, which is better and more valuable
than all the Treasures in the World!  
But that I may show You this embodied spirit and that you may touch It
with your hands, proceed as I teach you. Process to demonstrate the
corporified Anima Mundi!  
Take your putrefied Rain water, put it into a large glass Body cut off
low, or into a china basin of a large size, which place in an
earthenware pot, and evaporate this putrefied water gently, until there
remains only a 1/3 part of the whole. Let the fire die away whilst it is
yet luke warm, filter it through blotting paper. Pour the clear into a
clean pewter basin, or into an earthen glazed dish, which place in a
cool Cellar or Room, and during the night the celebrated Spiritus Mundi
will shoot in Crystals and appear under two different forms.  
The first is of a perfect crystalline transparent form, this shoots ah
round the sides of the Basin and settles on small sticks. if you place
any on the water.  
The second fixes itself on the bottom of the Basin, and is darker and
not so transparent.  
Here now you see that celebrated spirit, the Universal spirit, the Sperm
of the Macrocosm, the regenerated Chaos visible and bodily. Pour the
water off gently, and let the crystals dry. Those crystals which hang
all round the sides or on the sticks keep by themselves separately.
Those that are fixed on the bottom of the Basin keep separately also.  
With both sorts of crystals go to old Lame Vulcan and he will tell you
their Names! Take some of those Crystals which hung all round the sides
of the Basin, or were fastened to the sticks and throw them on lighted
Charcoal, and they will tell you what they are, They are called nitre.  
The bottom Crystals throw also on fiery Coals, they have a harsh voice
and spit about them. They are called Common salt or Alkaline salt.  
Here you have both names of the Corporified spirit Mundi!  
This nitre out of the Rain water fulmunates with sulphur, like any other
Salpetre, and has no other, or greater effect than Common purified
universal seed.  
The salt cracks and flies from the fiery coals like any other Common
salt, and shows the same effect in all other operations like good Common
salt. By this experiment you may perceive clearly the Center and Sperm
of all things, the Sperm of the World, visibly and corporified before
your eyes, and you may touch it with your hands! Both generate,
preserves, destroy and regenerate everything that is on Earth.  
In the atmosphere it is volatile and incorporeal, and produces volatile
meteors in water and earth, it assumes a crystalline Body. and produces
corporeal Subjects. according to different degrees of fixity; no objects
under the sun in their last resolution are found without one or the
other.  
Everything in Nature does consist of these two.  
  

    The one is Nitre               The other is Salt 
    The one is Acid                The other is Alkaline 
    The one is Spirit              The other is Body 
    This is the Father             This is the Mother 
    This is the Male Sperm         This is the Female Sperm 
    This is the Universal Agent    This the Universal Patient 
    Primordial Sulphur             Primordial Mercury and Salt 
    Fire and Air                   The Magnet 
    Chalybs Sendivogii             The Magnet 
    The Hammer                     The Anvil 
    Sulphur Naturae                Mercury and Salt Naturae

In the beginning this Chaotic water was entirely Volatile, because if
you did distil it before putrefaction, every drop of it ascends like
volatile water; By fermentation and putrefaction it gets a basis of
fixation and precipitates its subtil earth.  
The most volatile part of this water generates Animals, when it becomes
a little fixer it generates Vegetables, and when it becomes quite fixed
it generates Minerals and Metals. Whosoever like to generate minerals,
let him take the fixest parts, such as eath and water. If you like to
produce Vegetables, add to the earth and water some air and fire. If you
want to bring forth Animals add still more of the most volatile, that is
more air and fire, as containing more of the Universal. The vegetable
department stands between Animals and Minerals. because out of them a
Mineral or Stone may as soon be produced as an animal, as we shall show
hereafter.  
The efficient cause which has enabled us to see and feel the Universal
Corporified Sperm, is putrefaction, the Principal Key whereby the Lock
of Natural Subjects may be opened.  
The cause of fermentation and putrefaction is the implanted spirit which
is never idle whenever he meets with Humidity, his own instrument, by
means of which this spirit is ever busy, either visibly or invisibly,
either sensibly or insensibly, this causes fermentation and
putrefaction; and out of a volatile makes a fixt, and out of a fixt
again a volatile and this mutation is continued without ceasing.  
This spirit breaks and dissolves Stone and Rocks, which he himself has
coagulated and reduces them into Sand and Dust; this same spirit reduces
Trees into Mould and earth, and putrefies Animals, and again from such
putrefied substances produces Vegetables and Minerals, and this
continues from one thing into another.  
I have said that the Universal Corporified Sperm of the World, produced
out of the regenerated Chaos of Rain water, that is our nitre and salt
is not better than common nitre, and common salt, and it is truly so
because they produce the same effect and operation, and their is no
difference between them, except if the one should be more purified than
the other, but if they were equallv pure, there could be no difference;
therefore let the Artist not be deceived, if anyone would tell him, this
from the Chaotic water is the nitre of the Philosophers, and the other
is vulgar nitre, we say that such a distinction is folly and
superstition.  
If Common pure nitre produces the same effects as the other does, then
Common nitre is philosophical nitre; but that the Reader may be
convinced that the Universal nitre out of the Rain water is not better
than purified vulgar nitre, let him consider that the Universal nitre is
the Father and Generator of vulgar nitre, and he must then naturally
conclude that the Blood of the Infant must be like that of Father and
Mother, and that it must contain the very same principles and
consequently must produce the same effects as the Father, nay, it is
itself the Father, and is centrally one and the same with the Father and
omnipresent.  
Now if out of the Universal nitre and salt all things are produced.
Animals, Vegetables and Minerals, all things of course are reducible
into these their first principles. and still further into Vapour. That
all things proceed from universal seed is demonstrated by nitre and salt
being found everywhere in all things.  
  

### Chapter 11 That nitre and salt are found in the air and in all things in this World.

As we cannot ascend towards the heavenly Bodies, we must judge of what
is above by that which is below within our reach. The Firmament is full
of Light, Light is nothing else but attracted and repulsed, moved and
manifested fire of Nature or Universal spirit. This further agitated and
concentrated produces Heat and fire. Nitre is coagulated fire concealed
in air and Humidity; therefore we say and conclude, that the Heavens or
intermediate Space between us and the Heavenly Bodies consists of, or is
filled with a most volatile incorporeal nitre, which as it descends into
our Atmosphere and probably other atmospheres of Heavenly Bodies becomes
gradually more and more corporeal. Let this suffice concerning the
Spiritual Heavenly nitre. That there is nitre and salt in the Air is
plain by lightning, thunder and Hail. Here on Earth we cannot find
another subject which fulminates, thunders, and hails besides nitre or
stalteous things.  
Nitre is born spiritual and volatile in the Heavens, in the atmosphere
it becomes acid but remains spiritual and volatile, in water and earth
it assumes a visible and palpable Body; how that happens that it
inflames hails, fulminates and thunders in the atmosphere, we will first
demonstrate theoretically by physical reasons, and then mechanically by
practice.  
Nitre does not fulminate, except it meets with a contrary agent and is
excited by heat.  
The more volatile and subtil the nitre is, the more vehemently it
fulminates and is the easier enflamed.  
In the same manner volatile and subtil its contrary agent is the more
vehement, sudden and powerful in their mutual operation. The Light
heavenly fire and Life of all things is condense in the atmosphere in
the form of a subtil volatile nitre and this must have a contrary agent
for its operation.  
In order that this volatile nitre may obtain a contrary agent, there
ascends continually out of the Earth, Ocean and Rivers an equally
subtil, volatile, sulphureous, alcaline Earth in the shape of Vapours,
Fumes, and Fogs, filled with salt alcalicum Volatile. This is the
natural evaporation of the Earth excited by the Central heat of the
Earth. This ascends continually to meet the Volatile incorporeal nitre,
now, when they do meet in a dry rarified atmosphere they are moved by
the Sun's Rays, which by those ascending Vapours are collected and
concentrated, whereby these Vapours become more and more heated until
the subtil nitre takes fire and fulminates with this contrary
sulphureous, volatile, alcaline agent, rarefies the air all round and
thunders with dreadful Explosions as we observe during hot, dry, Summer
days.  
When on the contrary the atmosphere is dense and loaded with humidity,
these two Universal Agents meet peaceably: the subtil nitre joins itself
and embraces quietly the volatile sulphureous alcali without any
vehement concussions: as is the case in Winter, when Humidity and Cold
prevail in our atmosphere. Humidity and Cold hinder the inflammation
and, consequently the fulmen.  
Take nitre let it melt in a crucible, in an open fire, add to it a
volatile alcaline sulphureous nitre, such as sal ammoniac or volatile
nitre of urine, which is also sulphureous, or a volatile earth. Such are
Charcoal, Mineral sulphur, Vegetable and Animal Oils, and the nitre will
take fire and fulminate like gunpowder; the more volatile the earth or
the nitre is, but in a dry state, the more violently does the nitre
fulminate, and this reaction takes place only in a dry heat, but in
humidity they unite peaceably and quietly. Humidity is here a third
Medium which prevents the fulmen.  
If you dissolve volatile salt of urine, or sal ammoniac with nitre in
water, both are dissolved without violence or alteration, but if this
humidity or water is evaporated and coagulated over the fire to dryness,
so that they only commence to melt, they inflame and fulminate
immediately. Another evident proof we have in Aurum fulminans.  
The reason of its fulmen many have sought to explain, but few have known
it.  
Many chemists have attributed this fulmen to the sun itself: some to
compressed air, but here is the true reason:  
  
**The fulmen explained**  
Sun is dissolved in aqua regia, which must contain com. nitre or sal
ammoniac in order to become aqua regia. The sun when dissolved is
precipitateted with fixt oil of tartar or with any other alcali, such as
a volatile salt of urine, or so-called spirit of urine, and the Sol
falls to the bottom as a Spongy quicklime.  
Although this quicklime is edulcorated or washed a 100 times with water,
yet you will not take its fulmen from it by washing because some of the
vinegar and alcaline salt remain fixed therein so that such a sun
quicklime becomes heavier than the sun employed. Now let us examine the
quicklime or sun fulminans.  
It is on the same foundation of nitre and sal ammoniac dissolved in, and
then evaporated to dryness, with this difference, that here in the
progress of the sun fulminans, the ingredients or principles are
subtilised, and in the former solution only crude. The aqua regia is
composed of aqua fortis and sal ammoniac or Sea salt; aqua fortis is
spirit of nitre, the oil of Tartar for the precipitation is a fixt
alchali. Now when the sun is dissolved in the aqua regia containing a
highly volatile nitre by means of sal ammoniac as being a volatile
alcaline earth it is then precipitated with the oil of Tartar, which is
a subtil fixt alcaline earth, the vinegar spirit in the aqua fortis are
here partly saturated, precipitated and fixed by the salt of Tartar
their enemy and contrary, and as this fixt salt is more porous than the
earth of sun, it lets go the sun after having impregnated it first
strongly with fixt vinegar nitreous and volatile alcaline spirits, as
much as the atoms of sun will receive; for that reason it precipitates
the sun to the bottom and detains it as an earth. Every dry earth is
greedy to receive a salt, arid as these two salts of the aqua fortis and
sal ammoniac are very subtil and volatile they are easily excited and
inflamed by the least motion or smallest Heat: as soon as they feel
that, Heat, they fulminate and break forth downwards, as gunpowder shows
its greatest force upwards. Thus the volatile nitre and volatile alcali
in the sal ammoniac as powerful Re-agents cause the fulmen and explosion
and not the sun.  
The cause of the sun's explosion downwards is because it is a fixed
earth which inclines downwards, whilst the charcoal in the gunpowder
being a volatile sulphureous earth explodes upwards.  
We also observe a great difference between the force of the explosion of
sun fulm, and of common gunpowder, the explosion of sun fulm being three
times as violent as that of gunpowder because in the sun fulm is a
spiritual volatile highly subtilised nitre, whilst the gunpowder is
composed of crude corporeal nitre; therefore the more subtil, volatile
and spiritual the counter-agents are, the greater must be the effect.  
If you precipitate to the sun quicklime, in the room of taking a fixt
alcali such as the oil Tartari pr. delig. with a subtilised, volatilised
alcali, such as a salt volatile urineae or a vol: salt of Hartshorn, the
fulmen and explosion will be still more violent. Thus we have
demonstrated that the fulmen and explosion proceeds from the Universal
principles and not from the sun.  
On the contrary if you want to take the fulminating power from the sun
quicklime, proceed in this way; After having well washed your sun fulm.,
let the humidity drain from it on blotting paper; then make a strong
alcaline lye of fixed salt of Tartar and water, or of pure potash and
water, or oil of Tartar and water, and boil your sun fulminans is such a
lye for about 15 or 20 minutes, then wash and dry the quicklime and its
fulmen is entirely gone and lost.  
The reason of this phenomenon is, that the fixt alcaline lye dissolves
the volatile vinegar and alcaline counter-agents, which had fixed
themselves in the golden earth, and dissolving them destroys their
union, and by its fixity destroys the power of fulminating anymore.  
From all this it appears plain that the fulminating quality proceeds
from volatile nitre and a subtil, volatile alcali or a volatile
sulphureous earth, such as the charcoal sulphur, and the more volatile
those agents are, the stronger is the fulmen; and the fixer they are,
the less the fulminate. If you project an oil, sulphur, charcoal dust,
arsenic, \[unidentified symbol\], antimony, etc. into fluid nitre, they
repel each other and cause a violent reaction according to the
volatility and oiliness of the projected agent.  
On the contrary, if you project common nitre or fixed salt of Tartar or
any fixed alcali, or a fixed earth, such as terra sigillata, chalk,
quicklime, which contains nothing volatile into melted nitre, you will
see no re-action, but they will soon unite peaceably and fix each other,
without fulminating. We have now proved theoretically and practically
that there is a volatile nitre and salt in the air, and that the fulmen
proves it, as well as the experiment with thunder-rain water.  
  

### Chapter 12 That there is nitre and salt in all waters and earths. 

That nitre and salt is in Rain water we have proved by an Experiment.
That it is in all earths and waterss can easily be demonstrated.  
If you take any earth whether from fields, meadows, marshes, Hills or
Valleys, a sufficient quantity, and dissolve as much as you can of such
an earth in distilled Rain water, and then filter the solution and
evaporate it, until there remains no more than a third part of the whole
quantity of water employed, the pour it off into basins or dishes and
let it stand to cool over night in a cold place, and you will find
crystals of nitre and salt in a lesser or greater quantity, according as
the Earth was less or more impregnated with nitre and salt. The
Saltpetre boilers understand this best as they boil no earth but such as
is rich in nitre, to pay them for their labour.  
It is the same with all Waters, springs and wells, which are all more or
less impregnated with nitre and salt; nay, some Springs are thoroughly
saline and nitreous.  
Rivers flow out of the Earth, dissolve the nitre and salt and carry it
along with them into the Ocean. Why the Ocean more salt com, than nitre
is because the Sun reverberates it continually, principally between the
Tropics, where the Rays of Light fall more perpendicularly; this along
with the motion occasioned by the Winds and Tides convert the Aereal
incorporeal nitre into Sea salt; it looses its fulmen and becomes
alcaline.  
  
**Experiment**  
Take nitre with its own earth, before it is purified, and boil it often
in water, until it is dry, and increase your heat more and more as you
advance with your boilings, and you will see that the Nitre loses
gradually its Fulmen and becomes more and more fixed, until after 40 or
50 boilings it becomes quite fixed and alkailsed and fulminates no more,
but is converted into common salt. Therefore we say that Common or Sea
salt is nothing else but nitre originally, reverberated and alcalised by
the Rays of Light.  
  
**Fixation in Via Sicca**  
This fixation of nitre is done more expeditiously with quicklime viva,
than by the detonation with charcoal or sulphur.  
Take fiery stone lime fresh from the kiln, which reduce to powder and
Nitre finely powdered \[in equal parts\] mix the two powders by rubbing
them together in a mortar; 1/2 lb. of each. Put this mixture in a roomy
crucible, in a wind furnace and begin your fire gradually (a lid must he
luted on which must have a small hole in the middle) let the fire be
gentle the first two hours to season the crucible, then keep it moderate
during two hours more. so that the Coals lay no higher than the upper
part of the ^-. after that i.e. after the first four hours, cover the
crucible with Coals and keep up a good fire during four hours more, so
that the crucible, keeps always glowing hot like the fiery Coals. Then
let the fire go out gradually: towards night take out and break the
crucible and you will find your nitre alcalised or fixed in a lump which
is outwardly Green and inwardly Purple.  
Elixivate this mass with hot water, or powder it and let it flow per
delig. (this is best).  
During the first three or four hours of the operation the vinegar spirit
is forcibly driven out of the small hole in the cover and even through
the Luting, and displays various beautiful colours on the fiery Cof the
Generation o You may also fix nitre if you melt it with common salt \[in
equal parts\] or with fixt nitre of Tartar \[in equal parts\] and the
nitre becomes fixt.  
If you let the mass flow per dilig. evaporate your oil of fixt nitre to
a dry fat salt,. and melt that, and if you project sulphur or Powdered
Charcoal, it does no longer fulminate.  
NB. Such a nitre fixes sulphur by degrees.  
  

### Chapter 13 That nitre and salt is found in Animals, that Animals proceed from nitre and salt, and are resolved into nitre and salt. 

Whatsoever is intended to cause fertility must be saline or nitreous. or
it can be no manour. All Animals are nitreous or Saline, as by their
Chemical Anatomy, by distillation, we find they contain a certain
quantity of volatile, and some a fixt salt and a stinking oil or
sulphur. The fixt salt appears, when we calcine the ashes. That this
animal oil is a liquid salt is proved by its inflammation, because it
burns, and nothing can burn but what is either nitreeous, or
sulphureous. The fixt salt and fixt earth cannot burn. We have a still
stronger proof in the phosphorous made out of animal salts.  
That the Animal department is very nitreous is proved by the Saltpetre -
boilers in Germany, who dig up the floors of Stables and Cow-houses in
the country, such as have been abandoned, and by boiling such an earth,
they find it very rich of nitre.  
The same is done on old forsaken burying grounds, and they find such an
earth, if it has but laid long enough, very rich of nitre; which are
sufficient proofs that the animal department is nitreeous, and that
animal substances are reduced into nitre; and where into a Concrete is
reduced, from that very principle it has its origin, and this Resolution
and Mutation is performed bid the Archaeous of Nature, or Universal
spirit in the air.  
  

### Chapter 14 That nitre and salt is found in Vegetables; that Vegetables consist of nitre and salt, and are resolved into nitre and salt. 

That Vegetables grow by Dew and Rain out of water and earth is known to
all husband-men and gardeners.  
We have shown you that the pure and real essence of Dew and Rain nitre
and salt, and that all waters and earths do conceal either one or both.
Now it is known that the Universal Sperm, that is. Dew, Rain, Snow or
rather the nitre and salt concealed therein causes fertility and the
growth of Vegetables; nitre and salt are found in all waters and earths
if this be true, it is also true that Vegetables grow and live by those
salts, as a pure or empty earth or an empty water without Sperm are
insufficient for their production and preservation, and this sperm is
nothing else but nitre and salt.  
  
Experiment  
Take two parts of salt and one part of nitre, melt these two together in
a roomy crucible. When cold, beat the mass into a powder, and dissolved
1 lb. weight of it in 10 lbs. of Rain water, keep this for use. In this
water soak any seeds, until then swell, then dry them in the Sun, and
sow them in the ground. Now take some of the same Seeds not soaked in
this Spermatic water, and sow them close to the others, but mark both
places. You will soon perceive the sudden growth of the soaked Seeds the
beauty of the Fruit and the quantity in comparison to the unprepared
seeds. If you will pour about a quart of the above water to the root of
a Fruit tree or Vine, and repeat that once a month, for instance in
Febr: March and April, you will perceive a wonderful fertility of that
Tree that Season.  
That Vegetables are very nitreous in general yet some more than others,
appears by their Ardent spirit, or so-called S.V., by their Vinegar, by
their oiliness and alcaline salt. We see Vegetables break forth into a
strong Flame when they are set on Fire.  
Inflammability, Heat and Flame proceed from nitre and sulphur and from
nothing else.  
Is not the spirit Ardens or S.V. a subtil and heavenly nitre? It burns
so beautifully like the splendour of the Stars. That the oil contains a
salt is demonstrated by their alcali, whereby they dissolve sulphurs.  
We have also given satisfaction to this department and have proved that
their First Matter is nitre and salt, that is, their Universal not yet
specificated Matter, which when united universal seed generate all
things.  
  

### Chapter 15 That nitre and salt is found in Minerals; that Minerals are formed of nitre and salt, and are resolved into nitre and salt. 

The more the Universal fire of Nature approaches the earth, the more it
becomes terrestrial and corporeal; the more it becomes corporeal, it
becomes more fixt, and the more fixt it is, the less it is inflammable;
thus nitre descends from Heaven is volatile and incorporeal, although
visible in Light, and concealed in the water, out of which it becomes
manifest by putrefaction.  
The more terrestrial and fixer this nitre becomes the more it is
alcalised, and looses gradually its fulminating power, as appears in
minerals and metals; because the more it descends from its Universal
Nature, the more it alters its Nature and quality, and assumes a
different nature in Animals, a different character in Vegetables, and
different quality in minerals and Metals; yet it manifests its fiery
nature in all three, more or less, according to its degree of volatility
of Fixity; in the Animal and Vegetable departments in Oils, Fats, Resin,
Pitch, and in the Minerals in sulphureous substances, such as sulphur
etc.  
As the Minerals are of a Stony nature and descend gradually to more and
more fixity, the inflammable sulphur by gradual and continued fixation
is deprived of its inflammability and obtains another quality, and
incombustible one.  
That sulphur and such like adustable substances are of a nitreous origin
we have demonstrated before and proved, that all inflammability proceeds
from nitre. That there is a salt in Minerals is perceived, when we
elixivate a mineral with water, after having glowed it previously in the
fire; but that such a mineral salt is not always found in any
considerable quantity and sometimes hardly perceptible, is the reason,
because it becomes more and more terrestrial, and the more earth it
dissolves; the more it forsakes its original Saline nature, at to
outward appearance.  
We see plainly, that, if we wish to separate the firmly united mineral
and metallic Bodies, we are obliged to make use of Saline and nitreous
Menstrums, without which they cannot be opened, and that every menstrum
is either saline, nitreous, or mercurial, every good chemist knows.
Therefore as the minerals meet and dissolve in a saline menstruum it is
evident that they must possess a nature which is congenial to Salt or
nitre, or they could not be conquered thereby; thus they can be resolved
into a Saline or nitreous Nature, therefore such is also their first
origin.  
After having dissolved a Metallic Body in a Saline Menstruum, if you
evaporate your Solution to a third part, the solution will shoot into a
salt or vitriol, which vitriol by distillation and cohobation becomes an
vinegar, ponderous spirit or oil from or out of which they proceed at
first; because all minerals and metals proceed originally and are
generated from an acid, fermented, putrefied nitre and salt, which
dissolve a suitable Earth and from vitriol, sulphur, marcasit, metal;
which is done by a gradual fixation and nourishment by the original
nitreous and saline spirits thus as they were generated by an acid,
fermented spiritual nitre and salt, they are resolved by them and
brought back to their First Matter.

                            Mercury

The Body of saturn, jupiter, moon, and with more sulphur of Mars, Venus,
Sun, Platina I think is of a Solar nature from its weight and fixity.  
Minerals are generated from nitreous and saline waters, which penetrate
into the Earth through its pores and crevices, this nitreous saline
water is heated and fermented by the ascending central heat of the
Earth, is resolved into Vapours and forced upwards again towards the
circumference but by this continual circulation, these Vapours are
resolved again into water and ferment more and more, whereby they are
subtilised, rendered more acid and corroding. These fermented waters as
they contain a subtil spirit of nitre and salt, they become more and
more corrosive; if they were not corrosive, who could they dissolve
Stones and Rocks?  
Therefore this Corrosive water dissolves Rocks, Stones, and earths which
is condensed and coagulated again by the gentle subterraneous Heat into
Salt, but not into such a Salt as it was in the atmosphere or in the
Ocean, but into a Vitriolic Salt, which by succeeding vapours is formed
into a subtil, corrosive, smeary or unctuous earth, which the Miners all
Gur.  
This Gur is by succeeding Vapours dissolved and filled with corrosive
Acidity until it is changed into native sulphur; because the more
corrosive it receives, the more sulphureous it becomes; but when the
Mercurial Alcaline Vapours of Sea salt predominate over the nitreous
Sulphureous Vapours, the Universal Gur goes over into arsenic, which is
a dry mercury. Both sulphur as well as arsenic, by fixation and
succeeding Vapours become Marcasite, such as antimony, Cobalt, Bismith,
Wolfram, etc. this Marcasite is the first and nearest Matter toward
Metals, and not vitriol, which is the remote first Matter of Minerals
and Metals. That Sulphur is very corrosive, in plainly perceived by its
Smell, which is suffocating, when received in the lungs, and by its
spirit and oil which is a strong corrosive. We see that the spirit and
oil of vitriol are dissolved sulphureous vinegar, if you imbibe a fixt
earth, such as chalk therewith, and suffer the vinegar to evaporate
strongly from that earth in an open fire, you will see an inflammation
and burning like that of common sulphur. That sulphur has been a
nitreous salt, appears from its vinegarspirit which is of a Universal
mineral nature. When this vinegarspirit has forsaken the Body of the
sulphur, there remains an unctuous earth or the First Universal Mineral
Gur behind, in small quantity.  
The reader may judge whether I understand the generation of Minerals or
not: Let him proceed either towards or backwards in the Anatomy of
Minerals, and if he works rightly, he will see what he perhaps did not
believe before!  
Our ancestors have written that sulphur, mercury and salt are the First
Matter of Metals; true philosophers understand this properly; sulphur
and mercury proceed from salt and nitre, and metallic salt is vitriol
perfected and fixt; we have explained how the earth in the Mines by
receiving nitre, or corrosive vinegar becomes sulphur; but the more such
an earth is alcalised by nitre, so that the vinegar corrosive is
overcome, arsenic, mercury, or Mercurial subject is generated.  
Thus it appears plain that nitre and salt are the Sperm of the
Macrocosm, volatile and fixed; the visible elements air, water and earth
being the vehicle or dwelling of that Universal Sperm. All minerals are
generated by an acid corrosive vapour and subterraneous air animated by
nitre and salt, by the ancients named sulphur and mercury, because nitre
and salt contain the very seminal principles of sulphur and mercury,
which vapour and air are circulated and sublimed upwards by the central
fire become water and ferment, and by their corrosiveness dissolve a
suitable earth and generate the Mineral Gur; and what is it else that
performs this generation but the Universal fire of Nature, corporified
in nitre and salt.  
  

### Chapter 16 Of the principal Gate Key to Nature, the author of destruction and regeneration of all things, called Putrefaction. 

Heaven or fire; Anima and spirit Mundi is in its own Nature
unchangeable, omnipresent, and immortal, but as it gradually unites with
humidity, becomes the Universal vinegar and incorporeal Spiritus Mundi,
it lends itself then to all those changes the matter or corporified
humidity is subsequently liable to, therefore in the air it begins to
ferment, and still more so in water and earth, in order to prepare the
way for generation; without this fermentation and putrefaction the
Universal spirit does generate nothing.  
Therefore without previous maceration, fermentation, putrefaction in
gentle warmth and humidity, whether it be quick of slow, perceptible or
imperceptible, no real or genuine Anatomy of Natural Bodies, whether in
Universal or in specificated subjects can be effected.  
Dew, Rain, Snow, Hail, Frost, all without distinction ferment and
thereby cause a separation of the subtil from the gross, the sign of
which is, that a feeble sour smell is perceived.  
1. Animals putrify sooner and easier, and on account of their copious,
very volatile nitre they emit a most intolerable smell.  
2. Vegetables putrefy easily on account of their humidity, yet not so
quickly as animals, nor do they smell so badly.  
3. Minerals ferment and putrefy, but do not smell so badly as the former
two, except mars, which when in real putrefaction smells worse than a
corpse.  
From this putrefaction we learn that minerals are changed into
vegetables, and vegetables into Minerals, and thus Nature changes
continually, converting the uppermost into the lowest, and the lowest
into the highest, nay, the three Departments of Nature are changed into
universal principles. Vapours ascend continually from the Center of the
Earth towards the superficies, some of these are fat and sulphureous,
and serve the Mineral and Vegetable Departments, and when they penetrate
the superficies of the earth, they ascend in Fogs or Mists, and
ascending still higher they are Universalised. Exhalations from decayed
Trees, leaves, or Vegetables, ascend as well as those from putrid Animal
substances and are circulated in the Atmosphere, there to receive the
Spiritus Mundi for Reanimation and Chaotisation, which afterwards in the
character of regenerated atmospheric air return to Animals by
Inspiration, to Vegetables by a magnetic attraction, and to Minerals by
their own penetration and assuming a corrosive Nature, as we have
explained before.  
Few amongst the adolescent Philosophers as well as common self conceited
Chemists will put faith in what we say here, but we ourselves are
thoroughly convinced that we write the Truth.  
Putrefaction or Fermentation are the wonderful Fabricators, which out of
earth, produce water, out of water, air, out of air, fire, and convert
fire into air, air into water and water into earth earth into Gur,
vitriol, sulphur, arsenic, Marcasite, and Metals Nay, the Metals
themselves are dissolved and retrograded into vitriol and salt.  
This mutation is continued, until it will please God to calcine the
whole Earth and vitrifie it into Glass.  
  

### Chapter 17 What Putrefaction is. 

After God had created by Divine Emanation the Universal fire of Nature,
which on account of its essence, being a simple unity not composed of
parts, and consequently omnipresent and immortal and which has since
time immemorial been justly called the Soul or spirit of the Universe
but One in essence, but Threefold in manifestation, resembling its
Divine Origin, its Creator; To this Universal Agent, God has given a
Power to act by three differently manifested principles.  
1. In its omnipresent invisible, most Universal state it has a Universal
power of attracting and repulsion, and thereby is the first cause of
every Magnetism in the World and of every Celestial Body's keeping in
its proper place, as well as of gravitation and falling Bodies in
general.  
2. In its second manifestation of Light, it has Power to generate
Humidity, the firs step towards materiality, to move and ferment that
Humidity and thereby to generate the Universal vinegar and to become
cold incorporeal Spiritus Mundi, inwardly fire, therewith to animate
extended or dilated Humidity, that is atmospheric air, and further to
enliven the whole Creation.  
3. In this third manifestation of concentrated Light into Warmth, Heat,
and burning fire, it does and performs every necessary action what it
could not accomplish in its second and first state, nevertheless
remaining Centrally always One and the same and omnipresent.  
This Universal fire, endowed with an intelligent instinct, called the
Universal Agent of Nature, since its first emanation from God, has never
been inactive not one moment and produces one alteration after the
other, and although it seems to cease in one creature, or recedes from a
deceased subject, that same instant it is occupied in producing
something else out of such a death or temporal corruption, for which
reason the Ancient Philosophers have said "Corruptis unius est generatis
alterius." The corruption of one thing brings forth the generation of
the other.  
This universal fire is the Author and mover of all changes in Natural
Things and the Almighty can do with it what He pleases, either for the
preservation or destruction of His Creatures.  
This Universal spirit begins by Fermentation or by Putrefaction, by this
the spirit causes a separation of the pure from the impure, of the most
Volatile from the less and least Volatile, of the Subtil from the Gross,
when that is done, that same fire unites the pure Volatile again with
the less and least Volatile, and rejects what is not wanted for its
present purpose.  
The above spirit is the Generator, Preserver, Destroyer, and Regenerator
of all Things.  
When this fire descends into our corporeal Elements, it is detained by
them and obliged to assume Body, wherein it appears in a White, cold,
crystalline, transparent form nitre, outwardly cold, but inwardly fire;
When it inflames, and if there was a sufficient quantity of it and its
Enemy should meet him, he would become so irritated, that he would
overset an break not only Rocks, but the whole superficies on the
Earth.  
If its Sister, cold, fixed, Alcali salt, its Venus, whom it loves
dearly, which alone can overcome and tame it, was not coexistent and
always neat at hand, it nitre would long ago have destroyed the whole
Earth.  
Its Sister, or Wife, when they embrace each other in Pluto's Fiery
Palace does not permit him to do mischief much longer, but lays hold of
him by his very Center so that he must convert his Anger ito Love and
Friendship.  
As soon as he has embraced his Venus and is tied by ties of Love, he
forgets his passion totally, so that his Enemies approach him and even
lay hold of him he does not show the least inclination to hurt them, on
the contrary enters into permanent and everlasting Friendship with
them.  
This fire or spirit which is all in all Things is distributed in all
Creatures, and non can do without it.  
Therefore Putrefaction is the First Key and Gate, by means of which the
Universal spirit opens to us the Palace containing Natures Secrets.  
This spirit is never idle but is continually in action, by action and
motion, a warm propriety is communicated; this warmth whether
perceptible or not, opens the Pores of all Things, so that the implanted
spirit can penetrate everywhere, whether it be corruption or Generation,
for Death or Life; after this spirit has penetrated everywhere, it
begins to dissolve, and continues until the whole substance is
dissolved; the subtil volatile particles evaporate, according to the
degree of warmth, and emit a smell, by which we know clearly that the
spirit is operating and employed to open the Body by this natural
Digestion or Fermentation, and this continues until the proposed end is
attained.  
This spirit was in the beginning concealed in Vapour and water, and to
this moment forms all Things by means of Vapour and Water, and without
Humidity of water he generates nothing, because water or Humidity he
wants absolutely for his operations, mixings and solutions, as all
things mix easily with Humidity or water.  
This spirit generates Animals out of Humidity, as Animals consist of
humid and soft particles and after the extinction of the fire of Life,
they are resolved again into Shine and Humidity, by means of Humidity.
It is with Vegetables exactly the same, their juices may be compared to
the Fluids in Animals, and their woods and roots to Bones and
Cartilages.  
Much in the same manner does the Universal spirit generate Minerals by a
corrosive water, and removes them again into water by a corrosive
water.  
The Anima Mundi in its Most Universal State is invisible, and when
unmoved, for instance in the flint and steel, and in all things where
tranquil, is a cold fire. In its moved volatile state becomes visible in
Light, but remains cold, except it is concentrated and further agitated.
In its visible state of Light it is called Firmament or Heaven, volatile
incorporeal nitre, Ether, Anima, Agent, Male, air; when concentrated and
agitated it is Heat fire. When inclining towards corporification it is
Universal Acid. When corporified, but remains volatile it is called
water, vinegar, Sprit, nitre, salt, vitriol, sulphur, etc. But when it
inclines towards fixation it is earth, patient, Body, salt, female,
Magnet, and when fixed it is called Alcali, Female Magnet, Void.  
This is the true meaning of the Universal spirit and its various
forms.  
In the beginning it was a simple Vapour or water, animated by fire,
which like Protheus assumes various forms and shapes.  
Thus we have explained what is the cause of Putrefaction, viz. the
implanted fire, the moving, altering, warming, heating, inflaming.
separating, omnipresent, simple and homogeneous spirit, but in a double
twofold appearance, causing a conflict between Acid and Alcali, sulphur,
mercury, salt, Anima, Spirit, Corpus.
