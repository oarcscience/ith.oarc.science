<p>Day by day, during several weeks;<br> Thus in this one vile thing<br> You will discover and bring to perfection the whole work of Philosophy,<br> Which to most men appears impossible,<br> Though it is a convenient and easy task.<br> If we were to shew it to the outer world<br> We should be derided by men, women, and children.<br> Therefore be modest and secret,<br> And you will be left in peace and security.<br> Remember your duty towards your neighbour and your God,<br> Who gives this Art, and would have it concealed.<br> Now we will conclude the Preface,<br> That we may begin to describe the very Art,<br> And truly and plainly set it forth in figures,<br> Rendering thanks to the Creator of every creature.<br> Hereunto follows the First Figure,</p>  <table border="1">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="327">
