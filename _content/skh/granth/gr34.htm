<HR><CENTER><H1>Shri Guru Granth Sahib: Raag Prabhaatee</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><H2>Section 34 - Raag Prabhaatee - Part 001</H2></CENTER>
 One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<BR>
 Raag Parbhaatee Bibhaas, First Mehl, Chau-Padas, First House:<BR>
 Your Name carries us across; Your Name brings respect and worship.<BR>
 Your Name embellishes us; it is the object of the awakened mind.<BR>
 Your Name brings honor to everyone's name.<BR>
 Without Your Name, no one is ever respected. ||1||<BR>
 All other clever tricks are just for show.<BR>
 Whoever the Lord blesses with forgiveness - his affairs are perfectly resolved. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Your Name is my strength; Your Name is my support.<BR>
 Your Name is my army; Your Name is my king.<BR>
 Your Name brings honor, glory and approval.<BR>
 By Your Grace, one is blessed with the banner and the insignia of Your Mercy. ||2||<BR>
 Your Name brings intuitive peace and poise; Your Name brings praise.<BR>
 Your Name is the Ambrosial Nectar which cleans out the poison.<BR>
 Through Your Name, all peace and comfort comes to abide in the mind.<BR>
 Without the Name, they are bound and gagged, and dragged off to the City of Death. ||3||<BR>
 Man is involved with his wife, hearth and home, land and country,<BR>
 the pleasures of the mind and fine clothes;<BR>
 but when the call comes, he cannot delay.<BR>
 O Nanak, in the end, the false turn out to be false. ||4||1||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl:<BR>
 Your Name is the Jewel, and Your Grace is the Light. In awareness, there is Your Light.<BR>
 Darkness fills the dark, and then everything is lost. ||1||<BR>
 This whole world is corrupt.<BR>
 Your Name is the only cure; nothing else works, O Infinite Creator Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 One side of the scale holds tens of thousands, millions of nether regions and realms.<BR>
 O my Beloved, Your Worth could only be estimated if something else could be placed on the other side of the scale. ||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 34 - Raag Prabhaatee - Part 002</H2></CENTER>
 Out of pain, pleasure is produced, and out of pleasure comes pain.<BR>
 That mouth which praises You - what hunger could that mouth ever suffer? ||3||<BR>
 O Nanak, you alone are foolish; all the rest of the world is good.<BR>
 That body in which the Naam does not well up - that body becomes miserable. ||4||2||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl:<BR>
 For His sake, Brahma uttered the Vedas, and Shiva renounced Maya.<BR>
 For His sake, the Siddhas became hermits and renunciates; even the gods have not realized His Mystery. ||1||<BR>
 O Baba, keep the True Lord in your mind, and utter the Name of the True Lord with your mouth; the True Lord will carry you across.<BR>
 Enemies and pain shall not even approach you; only a rare few realize the Wisdom of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Fire, water and air make up the world; these three are the slaves of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 One who does not chant the Naam is a thief, dwelling in the fortress of the five thieves. ||2||<BR>
 If someone does a good deed for someone else, he totally puffs himself up in his conscious mind.<BR>
 The Lord bestows so many virtues and so much goodness; He does not ever regret it. ||3||<BR>
 Those who praise You gather the wealth in their laps; this is Nanak's wealth.<BR>
 Whoever shows respect to them is not summoned by the Messenger of Death. ||4||3||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl:<BR>
 One who has no beauty, no social status, no mouth, no flesh<BR>
 - meeting with the True Guru, he finds the Immaculate Lord, and dwells in Your Name. ||1||<BR>
 O detached Yogi, contemplate the essence of reality,<BR>
 and you shall never again come to be born into the world. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 One who does not have good karma or Dharmic faith, sacred rosary or mala<BR>
 - through the Light of God, wisdom is bestowed; the True Guru is our Protector. ||2||<BR>
 One who does not observe any fasts, make religious vows or chant<BR>
 - he does not have to worry about good luck or bad, if he obeys the Command of the True Guru. ||3||<BR>
 One who is not hopeful, nor hopeless, who has trained his intuitive consciousness<BR>
 - his being blends with the Supreme Being. O Nanak, his awareness is awakened. ||4||4||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl:<BR>
 What he says is approved in the Court of the Lord.<BR>
 He looks upon poison and nectar as one and the same. ||1||<BR>
 What can I say? You are permeating and pervading all.<BR>
 Whatever happens, is all by Your Will. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Divine Light shines radiantly, and egotistical pride is dispelled.<BR>
 The True Guru bestows the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, one's birth is approved,<BR>
 if one is honored in the True Court. ||3||<BR>
 Speaking and listening, one goes to the Celestial Home of the Indescribable Lord.<BR>
 Mere words of mouth, O Nanak, are burnt away. ||4||5||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl:<BR>
 One who bathes in the Ambrosial Water of spiritual wisdom takes with him the virtues of the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage.<BR>
 The Guru's Teachings are the gems and jewels; the Sikh who serves Him searches and finds them. ||1||<BR>
 There is no sacred shrine equal to the Guru.<BR>
 The Guru encompasses the ocean of contentment. ||1||Pause||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 34 - Raag Prabhaatee - Part 003</H2></CENTER>
 The Guru is the River, from which the Pure Water is obtained forever; it washes away the filth and pollution of evil-mindedness.<BR>
 Finding the True Guru, the perfect cleansing bath is obtained, which transforms even beasts and ghosts into gods. ||2||<BR>
 He is said to be the Guru, with the scent of sandalwood, who is imbued with the True Name to the bottom of His Heart.<BR>
 By His Fragrance, the world of vegetation is perfumed. Lovingly focus yourself on His Feet. ||3||<BR>
 The life of the soul wells up for the Gurmukh; the Gurmukh goes to the House of God.<BR>
 The Gurmukh, O Nanak, merges in the True One; the Gurmukh attains the exalted state of the self. ||4||6||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl:<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, contemplate spiritual knowledge; read it and study it, and you shall be honored.<BR>
 Within the self, the self is revealed, when one is blessed with the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O Creator Lord, You alone are my Benefactor.<BR>
 I beg for only one blessing from You: please bless me with Your Name. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The five wandering thieves are captured and held, and the egotistical pride of the mind is subdued.<BR>
 Visions of corruption, vice and evil-mindedness run away. Such is the spiritual wisdom of God. ||2||<BR>
 Please bless me with the rice of truth and self-restraint, the wheat of compassion, and the leaf-plate of meditation.<BR>
 Bless me with the milk of good karma, and the clarified butter, the ghee, of compassion. Such are the gifts I beg of You, Lord. ||3||<BR>
 Let forgiveness and patience be my milk-cows, and let the calf of my mind intuitively drink in this milk.<BR>
 I beg for the clothes of modesty and the Lord's Praise; Nanak chants the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||4||7||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl:<BR>
 No one can hold anyone back from coming; how could anyone hold anyone back from going?<BR>
 He alone thoroughly understands this, from whom all beings come; all are merged and immersed in Him. ||1||<BR>
 Waaho! - You are Great, and Wondrous is Your Will.<BR>
 Whatever You do, surely comes to pass. Nothing else can happen. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The buckets on the chain of the Persian wheel rotate; one empties out to fill another.<BR>
 This is just like the Play of our Lord and Master; such is His Glorious Greatness. ||2||<BR>
 Following the path of intuitive awareness, one turns away from the world, and one's vision is enlightened.<BR>
 Contemplate this in your mind, and see, O spiritual teacher. Who is the householder, and who is the renunciate? ||3||<BR>
 Hope comes from the Lord; surrendering to Him, we remain in the state of nirvaanaa.<BR>
 We come from Him; surrendering to Him, O Nanak, one is approved as a householder, and a renunciate. ||4||8||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl:<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to that one who binds in bondage his evil and corrupted gaze.<BR>
 One who does not know the difference between vice and virtue wanders around uselessly. ||1||<BR>
 Speak the True Name of the Creator Lord.<BR>
 Then, you shall never again have to come into this world. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Creator transforms the high into the low, and makes the lowly into kings.<BR>
 Those who know the All-knowing Lord are approved and certified as perfect in this world. ||2||<BR>
 If anyone is mistaken and fooled, you should go to instruct him.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 34 - Raag Prabhaatee - Part 004</H2></CENTER>
 The Creator Himself plays all the games; only a few understand this. ||3||<BR>
 Meditate on the Name, and the Word of the Shabad, in the early hours before dawn; leave your worldly entanglements behind.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, the slave of God's slaves: the world loses, and he wins. ||4||9||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl:<BR>
 The mind is Maya, the mind is a chaser; the mind is a bird flying across the sky.<BR>
 The thieves are overpowered by the Shabad, and then the body-village prospers and celebrates.<BR>
 Lord, when You save someone, he is saved; his capital is safe and sound. ||1||<BR>
 Such is my Treasure, the Jewel of the Naam;<BR>
 please bless me with the Guru's Teachings, so that I may fall at Your Feet. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The mind is a Yogi, the mind is a pleasure-seeker; the mind is foolish and ignorant.<BR>
 The mind is the giver, the mind is the beggar; the mind is the Great Guru, the Creator.<BR>
 The five thieves are conquered, and peace is attained; such is the contemplative wisdom of God. ||2||<BR>
 The One Lord is said to be in each and every heart, but no one can see Him.<BR>
 The false are cast upside-down into the womb of reincarnation; without the Name, they lose their honor.<BR>
 Those whom You unite, remain united, if it is Your Will. ||3||<BR>
 God does not ask about social class or birth; you must find your true home.<BR>
 That is your social class and that is your status - the karma of what you have done.<BR>
 The pains of death and rebirth are eradicated; O Nanak, salvation is in the Lord's Name. ||4||10||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl:<BR>
 He is awake, and even happy, but he is being plundered - he is blind!<BR>
 The noose is around his neck, and yet, his head is busy with worldly affairs.<BR>
 In hope, he comes and in desire, he leaves.<BR>
 The strings of his life are all tangled up; he is utterly helpless. ||1||<BR>
 The Lord of Awareness, the Lord of Life is awake and aware.<BR>
 He is the Ocean of peace, the Treasure of Ambrosial Nectar. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He does not understand what he is told; he is blind - he does not see, and so he does his evil deeds.<BR>
 The Transcendent Lord Himself showers His Love and Affection; by His Grace, He bestows glorious greatness. ||2||<BR>
 With the coming of each and every day, his life is wearing away, bit by bit; but still, his heart is attached to Maya.<BR>
 Without the Guru, he is drowned, and finds no place of rest, as long as he is caught in duality. ||3||<BR>
 Day and night, God watches over and takes care of His living beings; they receive pleasure and pain according to their past actions.<BR>
 Nanak, the unfortunate one, begs for the charity of Truth; please bless him with this glory. ||4||11||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl:<BR>
 If I remain silent, the world calls me a fool.<BR>
 If I talk too much, I miss out on Your Love.<BR>
 My mistakes and faults will be judged in Your Court.<BR>
 Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, how can I maintain good conduct? ||1||<BR>
 Such is the falsehood which is plundering the world.<BR>
 The slanderer slanders me, but even so, I love him. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He alone knows the way, who has been slandered.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he is stamped with the Lord's Insignia in His Court.<BR>
 He realizes the Naam, the Cause of causes, deep within himself.<BR>
 He alone knows the way, who is blessed by the Lord's Glance of Grace. ||2||<BR>
 I am filthy and polluted; the True Lord is Immaculate and Sublime.<BR>
 Calling oneself sublime, one does not become exalted.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh openly eats the great poison.<BR>
 But one who becomes Gurmukh is absorbed in the Name. ||3||<BR>
 I am blind, deaf, foolish and ignorant,<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 34 - Raag Prabhaatee - Part 005</H2></CENTER>
 the lowest of the low, the worst of the worst.<BR>
 I am poor, but I have the Wealth of Your Name, O my Beloved.<BR>
 This is the most excellent wealth; all else is poison and ashes. ||4||<BR>
 I pay no attention to slander and praise; I contemplate the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 I celebrate the One who blesses me with His Bounty.<BR>
 Whomever You forgive, O Lord, is blessed with status and honor.<BR>
 Says Nanak, I speak as He causes me to speak. ||5||12||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl:<BR>
 Eating too much, one's filth only increases; wearing fancy clothes, one's home is disgraced.<BR>
 Talking too much, one only starts arguments. Without the Name, everything is poison - know this well. ||1||<BR>
 O Baba, such is the treacherous trap which has caught my mind;<BR>
 riding out the waves of the storm, it will be enlightened by intuitive wisdom. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 They eat poison, speak poison and do poisonous deeds.<BR>
 Bound and gagged at Death's door, they are punished; they can be saved only through the True Name. ||2||<BR>
 As they come, they go. Their actions are recorded, and go along with them.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh loses his capital, and is punished in the Court of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 The world is false and polluted; only the True One is Pure. Contemplate Him through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 Those who have God's spiritual wisdom within, are known to be very rare. ||4||<BR>
 They endure the unendurable, and the Nectar of the Lord, the Embodiment of Bliss, trickles into them continuously.<BR>
 O Nanak, the fish is in love with the water; if it pleases You, Lord, please enshrine such love within me. ||5||13||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl:<BR>
 Songs, sounds, pleasures and clever tricks;<BR>
 joy, love and the power to command;<BR>
 fine clothes and food - these have no place in one's consciousness.<BR>
 True intuitive peace and poise rest in the Naam. ||1||<BR>
 What do I know about what God does?<BR>
 Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, nothing makes my body feel good. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Yoga, thrills, delicious flavors and ecstasy;<BR>
 wisdom, truth and love all come from devotion to the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 My own occupation is to work to praise the Lord.<BR>
 Deep within, I dwell on the Lord of the sun and the moon. ||2||<BR>
 I have lovingly enshrined the love of my Beloved within my heart.<BR>
 My Husband Lord, the Lord of the World, is the Master of the meek and the poor.<BR>
 Night and day, the Naam is my giving in charity and fasting.<BR>
 The waves have subsided, contemplating the essence of reality. ||3||<BR>
 What power do I have to speak the Unspoken?<BR>
 I worship You with devotion; You inspire me to do so.<BR>
 You dwell deep within; my egotism is dispelled.<BR>
 So whom should I serve? There is no other than You. ||4||<BR>
 The Word of the Guru's Shabad is utterly sweet and sublime.<BR>
 Such is the Ambrosial Nectar I see deep within.<BR>
 Those who taste this, attain the state of perfection.<BR>
 O Nanak, they are satisfied, and their bodies are at peace. ||5||14||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl:<BR>
 Deep within, I see the Shabad, the Word of God; my mind is pleased and appeased. Nothing else can touch and imbue me.<BR>
 Day and night, God watches over and cares for His beings and creatures; He is the Ruler of all. ||1||<BR>
 My God is dyed in the most beautiful and glorious color.<BR>
 Merciful to the meek and the poor, my Beloved is the Enticer of the mind; He is so very sweet, imbued with the deep crimson color of His Love. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Well is high up in the Tenth Gate; the Ambrosial Nectar flows, and I drink it in.<BR>
 The creation is His; He alone knows its ways and means. The Gurmukh contemplates spiritual wisdom. ||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 34 - Raag Prabhaatee - Part 006</H2></CENTER>
 The rays of light spread out, and the heart-lotus joyfully blossoms forth; the sun enters into the house of the moon.<BR>
 I have conquered death; the desires of the mind are destroyed. By Guru's Grace, I have found God. ||3||<BR>
 I am dyed in the deep crimson color of His Love. I am not colored by any other color.<BR>
 O Nanak, my tongue is saturated with the taste of God, who is permeating and pervading everywhere. ||4||15||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl:<BR>
 The Yogis are divided into twelve schools, the Sannyaasees into ten.<BR>
 The Yogis and those wearing religious robes, and the Jains with their all hair plucked out - without the Word of the Shabad, the noose is around their necks. ||1||<BR>
 Those who are imbued with the Shabad are the perfectly detached renunciates.<BR>
 They beg to receive charity in the hands of their hearts, embracing love and affection for the One. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Brahmins study and argue about the scriptures; they perform ceremonial rituals, and lead others in these rituals.<BR>
 Without true understanding, those self-willed manmukhs understand nothing. Separated from God, they suffer in pain. ||2||<BR>
 Those who receive the Shabad are sanctified and pure; they are approved in the True Court.<BR>
 Night and day, they remain lovingly attuned to the Naam; throughout the ages, they are merged in the True One. ||3||<BR>
 Good deeds, righteousness and Dharmic faith, purification, austere self-discipline, chanting, intense meditation and pilgrimages to sacred shrines - all these abide in the Shabad.<BR>
 O Nanak, united in union with the True Guru, suffering, sin and death run away. ||4||16||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl:<BR>
 The dust of the feet of the Saints, the Company of the Holy, and the Praises of the Lord carry us across to the other side.<BR>
 What can the wretched, terrified Messenger of Death do to the Gurmukhs? The Lord abides in their hearts. ||1||<BR>
 Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, life might just as well be burnt down.<BR>
 The Gurmukh chants and meditates on the Lord, chanting the chant on the mala; the Flavor of the Lord comes into the mind. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Those who follow the Guru's Teachings find true peace - how can I even describe the glory of such a person?<BR>
 The Gurmukh seeks and finds the gems and jewels, diamonds, rubies and treasures. ||2||<BR>
 So center yourself on the treasures of spiritual wisdom and meditation; remain lovingly attuned to the One True Lord, and the Word of His Shabad.<BR>
 Remain absorbed in the Primal State of the Fearless, Immaculate, Independent, Self-sufficient Lord. ||3||<BR>
 The seven seas are overflowing with the Immaculate Water; the inverted boat floats across.<BR>
 The mind which wandered in external distractions is restrained and held in check; the Gurmukh is intuitively absorbed in God. ||4||<BR>
 He is a householder, he is a renunciate and God's slave, who, as Gurmukh, realizes his own self.<BR>
 Says Nanak, his mind is pleased and appeased by the True Word of the Shabad; there is no other at all. ||5||17||<BR>
 Raag Prabhaatee, Third Mehl, Chau-Padas:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Those who become Gurmukh and understand are very rare; God is permeating and pervading through the Word of His Shabad.<BR>
 Those who are imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, find everlasting peace; they remain lovingly attuned to the True One. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 34 - Raag Prabhaatee - Part 007</H2></CENTER>
 Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, the mind becomes steady and stable; night and day, it remains satisfied with the Sublime Essence of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Night and day, perform devotional worship service to the Lord, day and night; this is the profit to be obtained in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 The humble beings are forever immaculate; no filth ever sticks to them. They focus their consciousness on the True Name. ||2||<BR>
 The True Guru has revealed the ornamentation of peace; the Glorious Greatness of the Naam is Great!<BR>
 The Inexhaustible Treasures are overflowing; they are never exhausted. So serve the Lord forever, O Siblings of Destiny. ||3||<BR>
 The Creator comes to abide in the minds of those whom He Himself has blessed.<BR>
 O Nanak, meditate forever on the Naam, which the True Guru has revealed. ||4||1||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, Third Mehl:<BR>
 I am unworthy; please forgive me and bless me, O my Lord and Master, and unite me with Yourself.<BR>
 You are Endless; no one can find Your limits. Through the Word of Your Shabad, You bestow understanding. ||1||<BR>
 O Dear Lord, I am a sacrifice to You.<BR>
 I dedicate my mind and body and place them in offering before You; I shall remain in Your Sanctuary forever. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Please keep me forever under Your Will, O my Lord and Master; please bless me with the Glorious Greatness of Your Name.<BR>
 Through the Perfect Guru, God's Will is revealed; night and day, remain absorbed in peace and poise. ||2||<BR>
 Those devotees who accept Your Will are pleasing to You, Lord; You Yourself forgive them, and unite them with Yourself.<BR>
 Accepting Your Will, I have found everlasting peace; the Guru has extinguished the fire of desire. ||3||<BR>
 Whatever You do comes to pass, O Creator; nothing else can be done.<BR>
 O Nanak, nothing is as great as the Blessing of the Name; it is obtained through the Perfect Guru. ||4||2||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The Gurmukhs praise the Lord; praising the Lord, they know Him.<BR>
 Doubt and duality are gone from within; they realize the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||<BR>
 O Dear Lord, You are my One and Only.<BR>
 I meditate on You and praise You; salvation and wisdom come from You. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Gurmukhs praise You; they receive the most excellent and sweet Ambrosial Nectar.<BR>
 This Nectar is forever sweet; it never loses its taste. Contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||2||<BR>
 He makes it seem so sweet to me; I am a sacrifice to Him.<BR>
 Through the Shabad, I praise the Giver of peace forever. I have eradicated self-conceit from within. ||3||<BR>
 My True Guru is forever the Giver. I receive whatever fruits and rewards I desire.<BR>
 O Nanak, through the Naam, glorious greatness is obtained; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the True One is found. ||4||3||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Those who enter Your Sanctuary, Dear Lord, are saved by Your Protective Power.<BR>
 I cannot even conceive of any other as Great as You. There never was, and there never shall be. ||1||<BR>
 O Dear Lord, I shall remain in Your Sanctuary forever.<BR>
 As it pleases You, You save me, O my Lord and Master; this is Your Glorious Greatness. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 O Dear Lord, You cherish and sustain those who seek Your Sanctuary.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 34 - Raag Prabhaatee - Part 008</H2></CENTER>
 O Dear Lord, the Messenger of Death cannot even touch those whom You, in Your Mercy, protect. ||2||<BR>
 True Is Your Sanctuary, O Dear Lord; it never diminishes or goes away.<BR>
 Those who abandon the Lord, and become attached to the love of duality, shall continue to die and be reborn. ||3||<BR>
 Those who seek Your Sanctuary, Dear Lord, shall never suffer in pain or hunger for anything.<BR>
 O Nanak, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord forever, and merge in the True Word of the Shabad. ||4||4||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, Third Mehl:<BR>
 As Gurmukh, meditate on the Dear Lord forever, as long as there is the breath of life.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the mind becomes immaculate, and egotistical pride is expelled from the mind.<BR>
 Fruitful and prosperous is the life of that mortal being, who is absorbed in the Name of the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, listen to the Teachings of the Guru.<BR>
 The Name of the Lord is the Giver of peace forever. With intuitive ease, drink in the Sublime Essence of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Those who understand their own origin dwell within the home of their inner being, in intuitive peace and poise.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the heart-lotus blossoms forth, and egotism and evil-mindedness are eradicated.<BR>
 The One True Lord is pervading amongst all; those who realize this are very rare. ||2||<BR>
 Through the Guru's Teachings, the mind becomes immaculate, speaking the Ambrosial Essence.<BR>
 The Name of the Lord dwells in the mind forever; within the mind, the mind is pleased and appeased.<BR>
 I am forever a sacrifice to my Guru, through whom I have realized the Lord, the Supreme Soul. ||3||<BR>
 Those human beings who do not serve the True Guru - their lives are uselessly wasted.<BR>
 When God bestows His Glance of Grace, then we meet the True Guru, merging in intuitive peace and poise.<BR>
 O Nanak, by great good fortune, the Naam is bestowed; by perfect destiny, meditate. ||4||5||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, Third Mehl:<BR>
 God Himself fashioned the many forms and colors; He created the Universe and staged the play.<BR>
 Creating the creation, He watches over it. He acts, and causes all to act; He gives sustenance to all beings. ||1||<BR>
 In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Lord is All-pervading.<BR>
 The One God is pervading and permeating each and every heart; the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is revealed to the Gurmukh. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is hidden, but it is pervasive in the Dark Age. The Lord is totally pervading and permeating each and every heart.<BR>
 The Jewel of the Naam is revealed within the hearts of those who hurry to the Sanctuary of the Guru. ||2||<BR>
 Whoever overpowers the five sense organs, is blessed with forgiveness, patience and contentment, through the Guru's Teachings.<BR>
 Blessed, blessed, perfect and great is that humble servant of the Lord, who is inspired by the Fear of God and detached love, to sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 If someone turns his face away from the Guru, and does not enshrine the Guru's Words in his consciousness<BR>
 - he may perform all sorts of rituals and accumulate wealth, but in the end, he will fall into hell. ||4||<BR>
 The One Shabad, the Word of the One God, is prevailing everywhere. All the creation came from the One Lord.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh is united in union. When the Gurmukh goes, he blends into the Lord, Har, Har. ||5||6||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, Third Mehl:<BR>
 O my mind, praise your Guru.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 34 - Raag Prabhaatee - Part 009</H2></CENTER>
 Perfect destiny is inscribed upon your forehead and face; sing the Praises of the Lord forever. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Lord bestows the Ambrosial Food of the Naam.<BR>
 Out of millions, only a rare few receive it<BR>
 - only those who are blessed by God's Glance of Grace. ||1||<BR>
 Whoever enshrines the Guru's Feet within his mind,<BR>
 is rid of pain and darkness from within.<BR>
 The True Lord unites him with Himself. ||2||<BR>
 So embrace love for the Word of the Guru's Bani.<BR>
 Here and hereafter, this is your only Support.<BR>
 The Creator Lord Himself bestows it. ||3||<BR>
 One whom the Lord inspires to accept His Will,<BR>
 is a wise and knowing devotee.<BR>
 Nanak is forever a sacrifice to him. ||4||7||17||7||24||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, Fourth Mehl, Bibhaas:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Through the Guru's Teachings, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord with joyous love and delight; I am enraptured, lovingly attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I drink in the Ambrosial Essence; I am a sacrifice to the Naam. ||1||<BR>
 The Lord, the Life of the World, is my Breath of Life.<BR>
 The Lofty and Exalted Lord became pleasing to my heart and my inner being, when the Guru breathed the Mantra of the Lord into my ears. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Come, O Saints: let us join together, O Siblings of Destiny; let us meet and chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 How am I to find my God? Please bless me with the Gift of the Lord's Teachings. ||2||<BR>

 By great good fortune, the Society of the Saints is found. Through the Guru, the True Guru, I receive the Touch of the Lord God. ||3||<BR>

 My God has infused this longing within me; I seek my Lord God. ||1||<BR>
 My mind is the dust of the feet of the Holy.<BR>
 The Guru has implanted the Sweet Name of the Lord, Har, Har, within me. I dust the Guru's Feet with my hair. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Dark are the days and nights of the faithless cynics; they are caught in the trap of attachment to Maya.<BR>
 The Lord God does not dwell in their hearts, even for an instant; every hair of their heads is totally tied up in debts. ||2||<BR>
 Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, wisdom and understanding are obtained, and one is released from the traps of egotism and possessiveness.<BR>

 The Sublime Essence of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is enshrined within my mind.<BR>
 As Gurmukh, I have obtained the cooling, soothing Water of the Naam. I eagerly drink in the sublime essence of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Those whose hearts are imbued with the Love of the Lord have the mark of radiant purity upon their foreheads.<BR>
 The Glory of the Lord's humble servant is manifest throughout the world, like the moon among the stars. ||2||<BR>
 Those whose hearts are not filled with the Lord's Name - all their affairs are worthless and insipid.<BR>
 They may adorn and decorate their bodies, but without the Naam, they look like their noses have been cut off. ||3||<BR>
 The Sovereign Lord permeates each and every heart; the One Lord is all-pervading everywhere.<BR>

 In the lake of the body, the Lord's Name has been revealed. Within my own home and mansion, I have obtained the Lord God. ||2||<BR>
 Those beings who wander in the wilderness of doubt - those faithless cynics are foolish, and are plundered.<BR>
 They are like the deer: the scent of musk comes from its own navel, but it wanders and roams around, searching for it in the bushes. ||3||<BR>
 You are Great and Unfathomable; Your Wisdom, God, is Profound and Incomprehensible. Please bless me with that wisdom, by which I might attain You, O Lord God.<BR>

 Even iron slag is transformed into gold, joining the Lord's Congregation. Through the Guru, the Lord's Light is enshrined within the heart. ||2||<BR>
 Those who are continually lured by greed, egotism and corruption, who are lured away by emotional attachment to their children and spouse<BR>
 - they never serve at the feet of the Saints; those self-willed manmukhs are filled with ashes. ||3||<BR>

 There is no other place of rest,<BR>
 none at all, without the Lord's Name.<BR>
 There is total success and salvation,<BR>
 and all affairs are perfectly resolved. ||1||<BR>
 Constantly chant the Name of the Lord.<BR>

 Attached to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, pain runs away. In His Sanctuary, He cherishes and sustains us.<BR>

 Prabhaatee, Ashtapadees, First Mehl, Bibhaas:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The insanity of duality has driven the mind insane.<BR>
 In false greed, life is wasting away.<BR>
 Duality clings to the mind; it cannot be restrained.<BR>
 The True Guru saves us, implanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord within. ||1||<BR>
 Without subduing the mind, Maya cannot be subdued.<BR>
 The One who created this, He alone understands. Contemplating the Word of the Shabad, one is carried across the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Gathering the wealth of Maya, kings become proud and arrogant.<BR>
 But this Maya that they love so much shall not go along with them in the end.<BR>
 There are so many colors and flavors of attachment to Maya.<BR>
 Except for the Name, no one has any friend or companion. ||2||<BR>
 According to one's own mind, one sees the minds of others.<BR>
 According to one's desires, one's condition is determined.<BR>
 According to one's actions, one is focused and tuned in.<BR>
 Seeking the advice of the True Guru, one finds the home of peace and poise. ||3||<BR>
 In music and song, the mind is caught by the love of duality.<BR>
 Filled with deception deep within, one suffers in terrible pain.<BR>
 Meeting with the True Guru, one is blessed with clear understanding,<BR>
 and remains lovingly attuned to the True Name. ||4||<BR>
 Through the True Word of the Shabad, one practices Truth.<BR>
 He sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, through the True Word of His Bani.<BR>
 He dwells in the home of his own heart deep within, and obtains the immortal status.<BR>
 Then, he is blessed with honor in the Court of the True Lord. ||5||<BR>
 Without serving the Guru, there is no devotional worship,<BR>
 even though one may make all sorts of efforts.<BR>
 If one eradicates egotism and selfishness through the Shabad,<BR>
 the Immaculate Naam comes to abide in the mind. ||6||<BR>
 In this world, the practice of the Shabad is the most excellent occupation.<BR>
 Without the Shabad, everything else is the darkness of emotional attachment.<BR>
 Through the Shabad, the Naam is enshrined within the heart.<BR>
 Through the Shabad, one obtains clear understanding and the door of salvation. ||7||<BR>
 There is no other Creator except the All-seeing Lord God.<BR>
 The True Lord Himself is Infinite and Incomparably Beautiful.<BR>
 Through the Lord's Name, one obtains the most sublime and exalted state.<BR>
 O Nanak, how rare are those humble beings, who seek and find the Lord. ||8||1||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl:<BR>
 Emotional attachment to Maya is spread out all over the world.<BR>
 Seeing a beautiful woman, the man is overcome with sexual desire.<BR>
 His love for his children and gold steadily increases.<BR>
 He sees everything as his own, but he does not own the One Lord. ||1||<BR>
 I meditate as I chant on such a mala,<BR>
 that I rise above pleasure and pain; I attain the most wondrous devotional worship of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 O Treasure of Virtue, Your limits cannot be found.<BR>
 Through the True Word of the Shabad, I am absorbed into You.<BR>
 You Yourself created the comings and goings of reincarnation.<BR>
 They alone are devotees, who focus their consciousness on You. ||2||<BR>
 Spiritual wisdom and meditation on the Lord, the Lord of Nirvaanaa<BR>
 - without meeting the True Guru, no one knows this.<BR>
 The Lord's Light fills the sacred pools of all beings.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to the Embodiment of Bliss. ||3||<BR>
 Through the Guru's Teachings, one achieves loving devotional worship.<BR>
 The Shabad burns away egotism from within.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 34 - Raag Prabhaatee - Part 017</H2></CENTER>
 The wandering mind is restrained and held in its place.<BR>
 The True Name is enshrined in the mind. ||4||<BR>
 The exciting and intoxicating worldly plays come to an end,<BR>
 for those who accept the Guru's Teachings, and become lovingly attuned to the One Lord.<BR>
 Seeing this, the fire in the water is extinguished.<BR>
 They alone realize this, who are blessed by great good fortune. ||5||<BR>
 Serving the True Guru, doubt is dispelled.<BR>
 Those who are lovingly attuned to the True Lord remain awake and aware night and day.<BR>
 They know the One Lord, and no other.<BR>
 Serving the Giver of peace, they become immaculate. ||6||<BR>
 Selfless service and intuitive awareness come by reflecting upon the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 Chanting, intensive meditation and austere self-discipline come by subduing the ego.<BR>
 One becomes Jivan-mukta - liberated while yet alive, by listening to the Shabad.<BR>
 Living a truthful way of life, one finds true peace. ||7||<BR>
 The Giver of peace is the Eradicator of pain.<BR>
 I cannot conceive of serving any other.<BR>
 I place my body, mind and wealth in offering before Him.<BR>
 Says Nanak, I have tasted the supreme, sublime Essence of the Lord. ||8||2||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl:<BR>
 You may perform exercises of inner purification, and fire up the furnace of the Kundalini, inhaling and exhaling and holding the breath.<BR>
 Without the True Guru, you will not understand; deluded by doubt, you shall drown and die.<BR>
 The spiritually blind are filled with filth and pollution; they may wash, but the filth within shall never depart.<BR>
 Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, all their actions are useless, like the magician who deceives through illuions. ||1||<BR>
 The merits of the six religious rituals are obtained through the Immaculate Naam.<BR>
 You, O Lord, are the Ocean of virtue; I am so unworthy. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Running around chasing the entanglements of Maya is an evil-minded act of corruption.<BR>
 The fool makes a show of his self-conceit; he does not know how to behave.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh is enticed by his desires for Maya; his words are useless and empty.<BR>
 The ritual cleansings of the sinner are fradulent; his rituals and decorations are useless and empty. ||2||<BR>
 False is the wisdom of the mind; its actions inspire useless disputes.<BR>
 The false are filled with egotism; they do not obtain the sublime taste of their Lord and Master.<BR>
 Without the Name, whatever else they do is tasteless and insipid.<BR>
 Associating with their enemies, they are plundered and ruined. Their speech is poison, and their lives are useless. ||3||<BR>
 Do not be deluded by doubt; do not invite your own death.<BR>
 Serve the True Guru, and you shall be at peace forever.<BR>
 Without the True Guru, no one is liberated.<BR>
 They come and go in reincarnation; they die, only to be reborn and die again. ||4||<BR>
 This body wanders, caught in the three dispositions.<BR>
 It is afflicted by sorrow and suffering.<BR>
 So serve the One who has no mother or father.<BR>
 Desire and selfishness shall depart from within. ||5||<BR>
 Wherever I look, I see Him.<BR>
 Without meeting the True Guru, no one is liberated.<BR>
 Enshrine the True One in your heart; this is the most excellent action.<BR>
 All other hypocritical actions and devotions bring only ruin. ||6||<BR>
 When one is rid of duality, then he realizes the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 Inside and out, he knows the One Lord.<BR>
 This is the most Excellent Wisdom of the Shabad.<BR>
 Ashes fall on the heads of those who are in duality. ||7||<BR>
 To praise the Lord through the Guru's Teachings is the most excellent action.<BR>
 In the Society of the Saints, contemplate the Glories of God and His spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 Whoever subdues his mind, knows the state of being dead while yet alive.<BR>
 O Nanak, by His Grace, the Gracious Lord is realized. ||8||3||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 34 - Raag Prabhaatee - Part 018</H2></CENTER>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl, Dakhnee:<BR>
 Ahalyaa was the wife of Gautam the seer. Seeing her, Indra was enticed.<BR>
 When he received a thousand marks of disgrace on his body, then he felt regret in his mind. ||1||<BR>
 O Siblings of Destiny, no one knowingly makes mistakes.<BR>
 He alone is mistaken, whom the Lord Himself makes so. He alone understands, whom the Lord causes to understand. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Harichand, the king and ruler of his land, did not appreciate the value of his pre-ordained destiny.<BR>
 If he had known that it was a mistake, he would not have made such a show of giving in charity, and he would not have been sold in the market. ||2||<BR>
 The Lord took the form of a dwarf, and asked for some land.<BR>
 If Bal the king has recognized Him, he would not have been deceived, and sent to the underworld. ||3||<BR>
 Vyaas taught and warned the king Janmayjaa not to do three things.<BR>
 But he performed the sacred feast and killed eighteen Brahmins; the record of one's past deeds cannot be erased. ||4||<BR>
 I do not try to calculate the account; I accept the Hukam of God's Command. I speak with intuitive love and respect.<BR>
 No matter what happens, I will praise the Lord. It is all Your Glorious Greatness, O Lord. ||5||<BR>
 The Gurmukh remains detached; filth never attaches itself to him. He remains forever in God's Sanctuary.<BR>
 The foolish self-willed manmukh does not think of the future; he is overtaken by pain, and then he regrets. ||6||<BR>
 The Creator who created this creation acts, and causes all to act.<BR>
 O Lord, egotistical pride does not depart from the soul. Falling into egotistical pride, one is ruined. ||7||<BR>
 Everyone makes mistakes; only the Creator does not make mistakes.<BR>
 O Nanak, salvation comes through the True Name. By Guru's Grace, one is released. ||8||4||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl:<BR>
 To chant and listen to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is my Support.<BR>
 Worthless entanglements are ended and gone.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh, caught in duality, loses his honor.<BR>
 Except for the Name, I have no other at all. ||1||<BR>
 Listen, O blind, foolish, idiotic mind.<BR>
 Aren't you ashamed of your comings and goings in reincarnation? Without the Guru, you shall drown, over and over again. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 This mind is ruined by its attachment to Maya.<BR>
 The Command of the Primal Lord is pre-ordained. Before whom should I cry?<BR>
 Only a few, as Gurmukh, understand this.<BR>
 Without the Naam, no one is liberated. ||2||<BR>
 People wander lost, staggering and stumbling through 8.4 million incarnations.<BR>
 Without knowing the Guru, they cannot escape the noose of Death.<BR>
 This mind, from one moment to the next, goes from the heavens to the underworld.<BR>
 The Gurmukh contemplates the Naam, and is released. ||3||<BR>
 When God sends His Summons, there is no time to delay.<BR>
 When one dies in the Word of the Shabad, he lives in peace.<BR>
 Without the Guru, no one understands.<BR>
 The Lord Himself acts, and inspires all to act. ||4||<BR>
 Inner conflict comes to an end, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<BR>
 Through the Perfect True Guru, one is intuitively absorbed into the Lord.<BR>
 This wobbling, unsteady mind is stabilized,<BR>
 and one lives the lifestyle of true actions. ||5||<BR>
 If someone is false within his own self, then how can he be pure?<BR>
 How rare are those who wash with the Shabad.<BR>
 How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, live the Truth.<BR>
 Their comings and goings in reincarnation are over and done. ||6||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 34 - Raag Prabhaatee - Part 019</H2></CENTER>
 Those who eat and drink the Fear of God, find the most excellent peace.<BR>
 Associating with the humble servants of the Lord, they are carried across.<BR>
 They speak the Truth, and lovingly inspire others to speak it as well.<BR>
 The Word of the Guru's Shabad is the most excellent occupation. ||7||<BR>
 Those who take the Lord's Praises as their karma and Dharma, their honor and worship service<BR>
 - their sexual desire and anger are burnt off in the fire.<BR>
 They taste the sublime essence of the Lord, and their minds are drenched with it.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, there is no other at all. ||8||5||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl:<BR>
 Chant the Lord's Name, and worship Him deep within your being.<BR>
 Contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and no other. ||1||<BR>
 The One is pervading all places.<BR>
 I do not see any other; unto whom should I offer worship? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I place my mind and body in offering before You; I dedicate my soul to You.<BR>
 As it pleases You, You save me, Lord; this is my prayer. ||2||<BR>
 True is that tongue which is delighted by the sublime essence of the Lord.<BR>
 Following the Guru's Teachings, one is saved in the Sanctuary of God. ||3||<BR>
 My God created religious rituals.<BR>
 He placed the glory of the Naam above these rituals. ||4||<BR>
 The four great blessings are under the control of the True Guru.<BR>
 When the first three are put aside, one is blessed with the fourth. ||5||<BR>
 Those whom the True Guru blesses with liberation and meditation<BR>
 realize the Lord's State, and become sublime. ||6||<BR>
 Their minds and bodies are cooled and soothed; the Guru imparts this understanding.<BR>
 Who can estimate the value of those whom God has exalted? ||7||<BR>
 Says Nanak, the Guru has imparted this understanding;<BR>
 without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, no one is emancipated. ||8||6||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, First Mehl:<BR>
 Some are forgiven by the Primal Lord God; the Perfect Guru makes the true making.<BR>
 Those who are attuned to the Love of the Lord are imbued with Truth forever; their pains are dispelled, and they obtain honor. ||1||<BR>
 False are the clever tricks of the evil-minded.<BR>
 They shall disappear in no time at all. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Pain and suffering afflict the self-willed manmukh. The pains of the self-willed manmukh shall never depart.<BR>
 The Gurmukh recognizes the Giver of pleasure and pain. He merges in His Sanctuary. ||2||<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs do not know loving devotional worship; they are insane, rotting away in their egotism.<BR>
 This mind flies in an instant from the heavens to the underworld, as long as it does not know the Word of the Shabad. ||3||<BR>
 The world has become hungry and thirsty; without the True Guru, it is not satisfied.<BR>
 Merging intuitively in the Celestial Lord, peace is obtained, and one goes to the Lord's Court wearing robes of honor. ||4||<BR>
 The Lord in His Court is Himself the Knower and Seer; the Word of the Guru's Bani is Immaculate.<BR>
 He Himself is the Awareness of Truth; He Himself understands the state of nirvaanaa. ||5||<BR>
 He made the waves of water, the fire and the air, and then joined the three together to form the world.<BR>
 He blessed these elements with such power, that they remain subject to His Command. ||6||<BR>
 How rare are those humble beings in this world, whom the Lord tests and places in His Treasury.<BR>
 They rise above social status and color, and rid themselves of possessiveness and greed. ||7||<BR>
 Attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they are like immaculate sacred shrines; they are rid of the pain and pollution of egotism.<BR>
 Nanak washes the feet of those who, as Gurmukh, love the True Lord. ||8||7||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 34 - Raag Prabhaatee - Part 020</H2></CENTER>
 Prabhaatee, Third Mehl, Bibhaas:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, see that the Temple of the Lord is within you.<BR>
 The Temple of the Lord is found through the Word of the Shabad; contemplate the Lord's Name. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, be joyfully attuned to the Shabad.<BR>
 True is devotional worship, and True is the Temple of the Lord; True is His Manifest Glory. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 This body is the Temple of the Lord, in which the jewel of spiritual wisdom is revealed.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs do not know anything at all; they do not believe that the Lord's Temple is within. ||2||<BR>
 The Dear Lord created the Temple of the Lord; He adorns it by His Will.<BR>
 All act according to their pre-ordained destiny; no one can erase it. ||3||<BR>
 Contemplating the Shabad, peace is obtained, loving the True Name.<BR>
 The Temple of the Lord is embellished with the Shabad; it is an Infinite Fortress of God. ||4||<BR>
 This world is the Temple of the Lord; without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness.<BR>
 The blind and foolish self-willed manmukhs worship in the love of duality. ||5||<BR>
 One's body and social status do not go along to that place, where all are called to account.<BR>
 Those who are attuned to Truth are saved; those in the love of duality are miserable. ||6||<BR>
 The treasure of the Naam is within the Temple of the Lord. The idiotic fools do not realize this.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, I have realized this. I keep the Lord enshrined within my heart. ||7||<BR>
 Those who are attuned to the love of the Shabad know the Guru, through the Word of the Guru's Bani.<BR>
 Sacred, pure and immaculate are those humble beings who are absorbed in the Name of the Lord. ||8||<BR>
 The Temple of the Lord is the Lord's Shop; He embellishes it with the Word of His Shabad.<BR>
 In that shop is the merchandise of the One Name; the Gurmukhs adorn themselves with it. ||9||<BR>
 The mind is like iron slag, within the Temple of the Lord; it is lured by the love of duality.<BR>
 Meeting with the Guru, the Philosopher's Stone, the mind is transformed into gold. Its value cannot be described. ||10||<BR>
 The Lord abides within the Temple of the Lord. He is pervading in all.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukhs trade in the merchandise of Truth. ||11||1||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Those who remain awake and aware in the Love and Fear of God, rid themselves of the filth and pollution of egotism.<BR>
 They remain awake and aware forever, and protect their homes, by beating and driving out the five thieves. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, as Gurmukh, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 O mind, do only those deeds which will lead you to the Path of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The celestial melody wells up in the Gurmukh, and the pains of egotism are taken away.<BR>
 The Name of the Lord abides in the mind, as one intuitively sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Those who follow the Guru's Teachings - their faces are radiant and beautiful. They keep the Lord enshrined in their hearts.<BR>
 Here and hereafter, they find absolute peace; chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, they are carried across to the other shore. ||3||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 34 - Raag Prabhaatee - Part 021</H2></CENTER>
 In egotism, one cannot remain awake and aware, and one's devotional worship of the Lord is not accepted.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs find no place in the Court of the Lord; they do their deeds in the love of duality. ||4||<BR>
 Cursed is the food, and cursed are the clothes, of those who are attached to the love of duality.<BR>
 They are like maggots in manure, sinking into manure. In death and rebirth, they are wasted away to ruin. ||5||<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to those who meet with the True Guru.<BR>
 I shall continue to associate with them; devoted to Truth, I am absorbed in Truth. ||6||<BR>
 By perfect destiny, the Guru is found. He cannot be found by any efforts.<BR>
 Through the True Guru, intuitive wisdom wells up; through the Word of the Shabad, egotism is burnt away. ||7||<BR>
 O my mind, hurry to the Sanctuary of the Lord; He is Potent to do everything.<BR>
 O Nanak, never forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Whatever He does, comes to pass. ||8||2||7||2||9||<BR>
 Bibhaas, Prabhaatee, Fifth Mehl, Ashtapadees:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Mother, father, siblings, children and spouse<BR>
 - involved with them, people eat the food of bliss.<BR>
 The mind is entangled in sweet emotional attachment.<BR>
 Those who seek God's Glorious Virtues are the support of my breath of life. ||1||<BR>
 My One Lord is the Inner-Knower, the Searcher of hearts.<BR>
 He alone is my Support; He is my only Protection. My Great Lord and Master is over and above the heads of kings. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I have broken my ties to that deceitful serpent.<BR>
 The Guru has told me that it is false and fraudulent.<BR>
 Its face is sweet, but it tastes very bitter.<BR>
 My mind remains satisfied with the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 I have broken my ties with greed and emotional attachment.<BR>
 The Merciful Guru has rescued me from them.<BR>
 These cheating thieves have plundered so many homes.<BR>
 The Merciful Guru has protected and saved me. ||3||<BR>
 I have no dealings whatsoever with sexual desire and anger.<BR>
 I listen to the Guru's Teachings.<BR>
 Wherever I look, I see the most horrible goblins.<BR>
 My Guru, the Lord of the World, has saved me from them. ||4||<BR>
 I have made widows of the ten sensory organs.<BR>
 The Guru has told me that these pleasures are the fires of corruption.<BR>
 Those who associate with them go to hell.<BR>
 The Guru has saved me; I am lovingly attuned to the Lord. ||5||<BR>
 I have forsaken the advice of my ego.<BR>
 The Guru has told me that this is foolish stubbornness.<BR>
 This ego is homeless; it shall never find a home.<BR>
 The Guru has saved me; I am lovingly attuned to the Lord. ||6||<BR>
 I have become alienated from these people.<BR>
 We cannot both live together in one home.<BR>
 Grasping the hem of the Guru's Robe, I have come to God.<BR>
 Please be fair with me, All-knowing Lord God. ||7||<BR>
 God smiled at me and spoke, passing judgement.<BR>
 He made all the demons perform service for me.<BR>
 You are my Lord and Master; all this home belongs to You.<BR>
 Says Nanak, the Guru has passed judgement. ||8||1||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 34 - Raag Prabhaatee - Part 022</H2></CENTER>
 Within the mind dwell anger and massive ego.<BR>
 Worship services are performed with great pomp and ceremony.<BR>
 Ritual cleansing baths are taken, and sacred marks are applied to the body.<BR>
 But still, the filth and pollution within never depart. ||1||<BR>
 No one has ever found God in this way.<BR>
 The sacred mudras - ritualistic hand gestures - are made, but the mind remains enticed by Maya. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 They commit sins, under the influence of the five thieves.<BR>
 They bathe at sacred shrines, and claim that everything has been washed off.<BR>
 Then they commit them again, without fear of the consequences.<BR>
 The sinners are bound and gagged, and taken to the City of Death. ||2||<BR>
 The ankle-bells shake and the cymbals vibrate,<BR>
 but those who have deception within wander lost like demons.<BR>
 By destroying its hole, the snake is not killed.<BR>
 God, who created you, knows everything. ||3||<BR>
 You worship fire and wear saffron colored robes.<BR>
 Stung by your misfortune, you abandon your home.<BR>
 Leaving your own country, you wander in foreign lands.<BR>
 But you bring the five rejects with you. ||4||<BR>
 You have split your ears, and now you steal crumbs.<BR>
 You beg from door to door, but you fail to be satisfied.<BR>
 You have abandoned your own wife, but now you sneak glances at other women.<BR>
 God is not found by wearing religious robes; you are utterly miserable! ||5||<BR>
 He does not speak; he is on silence.<BR>
 But he is filled with desire; he is made to wander in reincarnation.<BR>
 Abstaining from food, his body suffers in pain.<BR>
 He does not realize the Hukam of the Lord's Command; he is afflicted by possessiveness. ||6||<BR>
 Without the True Guru, no one has attained the supreme status.<BR>
 Go ahead and ask all the Vedas and the Simritees.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs do useless deeds.<BR>
 They are like a house of sand, which cannot stand. ||7||<BR>
 One unto whom the Lord of the Universe becomes Merciful,<BR>
 sews the Word of the Guru's Shabad into his robes.<BR>
 Out of millions, it is rare that such a Saint is seen.<BR>
 O Nanak, with him, we are carried across. ||8||<BR>
 If one has such good destiny, then the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is obtained.<BR>
 He saves himself, and carries across all his family as well. ||1||SECOND PAUSE||2||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, all the sins are erased.<BR>
 The accounts held by the Righteous Judge of Dharma are torn up.<BR>
 Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,<BR>
 I have found the Sublime Essence of the Lord. The Supreme Lord God has melted into my heart. ||1||<BR>
 Dwelling on the Lord, Har, Har, I have found peace.<BR>
 Your slaves seek the Sanctuary of Your Feet. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The cycle of reincarnation is ended, and darkness is dispelled.<BR>
 The Guru has revealed the door of liberation.<BR>
 My mind and body are forever imbued with loving devotion to the Lord.<BR>
 Now I know God, because He has made me know Him. ||2||<BR>
 He is contained in each and every heart.<BR>
 Without Him, there is no one at all.<BR>
 Hatred, conflict, fear and doubt have been eliminated.<BR>
 God, the Soul of Pure Goodness, has manifested His Righteousness. ||3||<BR>
 He has rescued me from the most dangerous waves.<BR>
 Separated from Him for countless lifetimes, I am united with Him once again.<BR>
 Chanting, intense meditation and strict self-discipline are the contemplation of the Naam.<BR>
 My Lord and Master has blessed me with His Glance of Grace. ||4||<BR>
 Bliss, peace and salvation are found in that place,<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 34 - Raag Prabhaatee - Part 023</H2></CENTER>
 where the servants of the Lord of the World abide.<BR>
 God, the Lord of the World, is pleased and satisfied with me.<BR>
 My disharmony with Him of so many lifetimes is ended. ||5||<BR>
 Burnt offerings, sacred feasts, intense meditations with the body upside-down, worship services<BR>
 and taking millions of cleansing baths at sacred shrines of pilgrimage<BR>
 - the merits of all these are obtained by enshrining the Lord's Lotus Feet within the heart, even for an instant.<BR>
 Meditating on the Lord of the Universe, all one's affairs are resolved. ||6||<BR>
 God's Place is the highest of the high.<BR>
 The Lord's humble servants intuitively focus their meditation on Him.<BR>
 I long for the dust of the slaves of the Lord's slaves.<BR>
 My Beloved Lord is overflowing with all powers. ||7||<BR>
 My Beloved Lord, my Mother and Father, is always near.<BR>
 O my Friend and Companion, You are my Trusted Support.<BR>
 God takes His slaves by the hand, and makes them His Own.<BR>

 Bibhaas, Prabhaatee, The Word Of Devotee Kabeer Jee:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 My anxious fears of death and rebirth have been taken away.<BR>
 The Celestial Lord has shown His Love for me. ||1||<BR>
 The Divine Light has dawned, and darkness has been dispelled.<BR>
 Contemplating the Lord, I have obtained the Jewel of His Name. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Pain runs far away from that place where there is bliss.<BR>
 The jewel of the mind is focused and attuned to the essence of reality. ||2||<BR>
 Whatever happens is by the Pleasure of Your Will.<BR>
 Whoever understands this, is intuitively merged in the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 Says Kabeer, my sins have been obliterated.<BR>
 My mind has merged into the Lord, the Life of the World. ||4||1||<BR>
 PRABHAATEE:<BR>
 If the Lord Allah lives only in the mosque, then to whom does the rest of the world belong?<BR>
 According to the Hindus, the Lord's Name abides in the idol, but there is no truth in either of these claims. ||1||<BR>
 O Allah, O Raam, I live by Your Name.<BR>
 Please show mercy to me, O Master. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The God of the Hindus lives in the southern lands, and the God of the Muslims lives in the west.<BR>
 So search in your heart - look deep into your heart of hearts; this is the home and the place where God lives. ||2||<BR>
 The Brahmins observe twenty-four fasts during the year, and the Muslims fast during the month of Ramadaan.<BR>
 The Muslims set aside eleven months, and claim that the treasure is only in the one month. ||3||<BR>
 What is the use of bathing at Orissa? Why do the Muslims bow their heads in the mosque?<BR>
 If someone has deception in his heart, what good is it for him to utter prayers? And what good is it for him to go on pilgrimage to Mecca? ||4||<BR>
 You fashioned all these men and women, Lord. All these are Your Forms.<BR>
 Kabeer is the child of God, Allah, Raam. All the Gurus and prophets are mine. ||5||<BR>
 Says Kabeer, listen, O men and women: seek the Sanctuary of the One.<BR>
 Chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, O mortals, and you shall surely be carried across. ||6||2||<BR>
 PRABHAATEE:<BR>
 First, Allah created the Light; then, by His Creative Power, He made all mortal beings.<BR>
 From the One Light, the entire universe welled up. So who is good, and who is bad? ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 34 - Raag Prabhaatee - Part 024</H2></CENTER>
 O people, O Siblings of Destiny, do not wander deluded by doubt.<BR>
 The Creation is in the Creator, and the Creator is in the Creation, totally pervading and permeating all places. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The clay is the same, but the Fashioner has fashioned it in various ways.<BR>
 There is nothing wrong with the pot of clay - there is nothing wrong with the Potter. ||2||<BR>
 The One True Lord abides in all; by His making, everything is made.<BR>
 Whoever realizes the Hukam of His Command, knows the One Lord. He alone is said to be the Lord's slave. ||3||<BR>
 The Lord Allah is Unseen; He cannot be seen. The Guru has blessed me with this sweet molasses.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, my anxiety and fear have been taken away; I see the Immaculate Lord pervading everywhere. ||4||3||<BR>
 PRABHAATEE:<BR>
 Do not say that the Vedas, the Bible and the Koran are false. Those who do not contemplate them are false.<BR>
 You say that the One Lord is in all, so why do you kill chickens? ||1||<BR>
 O Mullah, tell me: is this God's Justice?<BR>
 The doubts of your mind have not been dispelled. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You seize a living creature, and then bring it home and kill its body; you have killed only the clay.<BR>
 The light of the soul passes into another form. So tell me, what have you killed? ||2||<BR>
 And what good are your purifications? Why do you bother to wash your face? And why do you bother to bow your head in the mosque?<BR>
 Your heart is full of hypocrisy; what good are your prayers or your pilgrimage to Mecca? ||3||<BR>
 You are impure; you do not understand the Pure Lord. You do not know His Mystery.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, you have missed out on paradise; your mind is set on hell. ||4||4||<BR>
 PRABHAATEE:<BR>
 Hear my prayer, Lord; You are the Divine Light of the Divine, the Primal, All-pervading Master.<BR>
 The Siddhas in Samaadhi have not found Your limits. They hold tight to the Protection of Your Sanctuary. ||1||<BR>
 Worship and adoration of the Pure, Primal Lord comes by worshipping the True Guru, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 Standing at His Door, Brahma studies the Vedas, but he cannot see the Unseen Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 With the oil of knowledge about the essence of reality, and the wick of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, this lamp illluminates my body.<BR>
 I have applied the Light of the Lord of the Universe, and lit this lamp. God the Knower knows. ||2||<BR>
 The Unstruck Melody of the Panch Shabad, the Five Primal Sounds, vibrates and resounds. I dwell with the Lord of the World.<BR>
 Kabeer, Your slave, performs this Aartee, this lamp-lit worship service for You, O Formless Lord of Nirvaanaa. ||3||5||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, The Word Of Devotee Naam Dayv Jee:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The mind alone knows the state of the mind; I tell it to the Knowing Lord.<BR>
 I chant the Name of the Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts - why should I be afraid? ||1||<BR>
 My mind is pierced through by the love of the Lord of the World.<BR>
 My God is All-pervading everywhere. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The mind is the shop, the mind is the town, and the mind is the shopkeeper.<BR>
 The mind abides in various forms, wandering all across the world. ||2||<BR>
 This mind is imbued with the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and duality is easily overcome.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 34 - Raag Prabhaatee - Part 025</H2></CENTER>
 He Himself is the Commander; all are under His Command. The Fearless Lord looks on all alike. ||3||<BR>
 That humble being who knows, and meditates on the Supreme Primal Being - his word becomes eternal.<BR>
 Says Naam Dayv, I have found the Invisible, Wondrous Lord, the Life of the World, within my heart. ||4||1||<BR>
 PRABHAATEE:<BR>
 He existed in the beginning, in the primeval age, and all throughout the ages; His limits cannot be known.<BR>
 The Lord is pervading and permeating amongst all; this is how His Form can be described. ||1||<BR>
 The Lord of the Universe appears when the Word of His Shabad is chanted.<BR>
 My Lord is the Embodiment of Bliss. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The beautiful fragrance of sandalwood emanates from the sandalwood tree, and attaches to the other trees of the forest.<BR>
 God, the Primal Source of everything, is like the sandalwood tree; He transforms us woody trees into fragrant sandalwood. ||2||<BR>
 You, O Lord, are the Philosopher's Stone, and I am iron; associating with You, I am transformed into gold.<BR>
 You are Merciful; You are the gem and the jewel. Naam Dayv is absorbed in the Truth. ||3||2||<BR>
 PRABHAATEE:<BR>
 The Primal Being has no ancestry; He has staged this play.<BR>
 God is hidden deep within each and every heart. ||1||<BR>
 No one knows the Light of the soul.<BR>
 Whatever I do, is known to You, Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Just as the pitcher is made from clay,<BR>
 everything is made from the Beloved Divine Creator Himself. ||2||<BR>
 The mortal's actions hold the soul in the bondage of karma.<BR>
 Whatever he does, he does on his own. ||3||<BR>
 Prays Naam Dayv, whatever this soul wants, it obtains.<BR>
 Whoever abides in the Lord, becomes immortal. ||4||3||<BR>
 Prabhaatee, The Word Of Devotee Baynee Jee:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 You rub your body with sandalwood oil, and place basil leaves on your forehead.<BR>
 But you hold a knife in the hand of your heart.<BR>
 You look like a thug; pretending to meditate, you pose like a crane.<BR>
 You try to look like a Vaishnaav, but the breath of life escapes through your mouth. ||1||<BR>
 You pray for hours to God the Beautiful.<BR>
 But your gaze is evil, and your nights are wasted in conflict. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You perform daily cleansing rituals,<BR>
 wear two loin-cloths, perform religious rituals and put only milk in your mouth.<BR>
 But in your heart, you have drawn out the sword.<BR>
 You routinely steal the property of others. ||2||<BR>
 You worship the stone idol, and paint ceremonial marks of Ganesha.<BR>
 You remain awake throughout the night, pretending to worship God.<BR>
 You dance, but your consciousness is filled with evil.<BR>
 You are lewd and depraved - this is such an unrighteous dance! ||3||<BR>
 You sit on a deer-skin, and chant on your mala.<BR>
 You put the sacred mark, the tilak, on your forehead.<BR>
 You wear the rosary beads of Shiva around your neck, but your heart is filled with falsehood.<BR>
 You are lewd and depraved - you do not chant God's Name. ||4||<BR>
 Whoever does not realize the essence of the soul<BR>
 - all his religious actions are hollow and false.<BR>
 Says Baynee, as Gurmukh, meditate.<BR>
 Without the True Guru, you shall not find the Way. ||5||1||<BR>
