<HR><CENTER><H1>Shri Guru Granth Sahib: Raag Jaijaavantee</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><H2>Section 35 - Raag Jaijaavantee - Part 001</H2></CENTER>
 One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<BR>
 Raag Jaijaavantee, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 Meditate in remembrance on the Lord - meditate on the Lord; this alone shall be of use to you.<BR>
 Abandon your association with Maya, and take shelter in the Sanctuary of God.<BR>
 Remember that the pleasures of the world are false; this whole show is just an illusion. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You must understand that this wealth is just a dream. Why are you so proud?<BR>
 The empires of the earth are like walls of sand. ||1||<BR>
 Servant Nanak speaks the Truth: your body shall perish and pass away.<BR>
 Moment by moment, yesterday passed. Today is passing as well. ||2||1||<BR>
 Jaijaavantee, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 Meditate on the Lord - vibrate on the Lord; your life is slipping away.<BR>
 Why am I telling you this again and again? You fool - why don't you understand?<BR>
 Your body is like a hail-stone; it melts away in no time at all. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 So give up all your doubts, and utter the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 At the very last moment, this alone shall go along with you. ||1||<BR>
 Forget the poisonous sins of corruption, and enshrine the Praises of God in your heart.<BR>
 Servant Nanak proclaims that this opportunity is slipping away. ||2||2||<BR>
 Jaijaavantee, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 O mortal, what will your condition be?<BR>
 In this world, you have not listened to the Lord's Name.<BR>
 You are totally engrossed in corruption and sin; you have not turned your mind away from them at all. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You obtained this human life, but you have not remembered the Lord in meditation, even for an instant.<BR>
 For the sake of pleasure, you have become subservient to your woman, and now your feet are bound. ||1||<BR>
 Servant Nanak proclaims that the vast expanse of this world is just a dream.<BR>
 Why not meditate on the Lord? Even Maya is His slave. ||2||3||<BR>
 Jaijaavantee, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 Slipping away - your life is uselessly slipping away.<BR>
 Night and day, you listen to the Puraanas, but you do not understand them, you ignorant fool!<BR>
 Death has arrived; now where will you run? ||1||Pause||<BR>
