<HR><CENTER><H1>Shri Guru Granth Sahib: Raag Wadahans</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 001</H2></CENTER>
 One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<BR>
 Raag Wadahans, First Mehl, First House:<BR>
 To the addict, there is nothing like the drug; to the fish, there is nothing else like water.<BR>
 Those who are attuned to their Lord - everyone is pleasing to them. ||1||<BR>
 I am a sacrifice, cut apart into pieces, a sacrifice to Your Name, O Lord Master. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Lord is the fruitful tree; His Name is ambrosial nectar.<BR>
 Those who drink it in are satisfied; I am a sacrifice to them. ||2||<BR>
 You are not visible to me, although You dwell with everyone.<BR>
 How can the thirst of the thirsty be quenched, with that wall between me and the pond? ||3||<BR>
 Nanak is Your merchant; You, O Lord Master, are my merchandise.<BR>
 My mind is cleansed of doubt, only when I praise You, and pray to You. ||4||1||<BR>
 Wadahans, First Mehl:<BR>
 The virtuous bride enjoys her Husband Lord; why does the unworthy one cry out?<BR>
 If she were to become virtuous, then she too could enjoy her Husband Lord. ||1||<BR>
 My Husband Lord is loving and playful; why should the soul-bride enjoy anyone else? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 If the soul-bride does good deeds, and strings them on the thread of her mind,<BR>
 she obtains the jewel, which cannot be purchased for any price, strung upon the thread of her consciousness. ||2||<BR>
 I ask, but do not follow the way shown to me; still, I claim to have reached my destination.<BR>
 I do not speak with You, O my Husband Lord; how then can I come to have a place in Your home? ||3||<BR>
 O Nanak, without the One Lord, there is no other at all.<BR>
 If the soul-bride remains attached to You, then she shall enjoy her Husband Lord. ||4||2||<BR>
 Wadahans, First Mehl, Second House:<BR>
 The peacocks are singing so sweetly, O sister; the rainy season of Saawan has come.<BR>
 Your beauteous eyes are like a string of charms, fascinating and enticing the soul-bride.<BR>
 I would cut myself into pieces for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; I am a sacrifice to Your Name.<BR>
 I take pride in You; without You, what could I be proud of?<BR>
 So smash your bracelets along with your bed, O soul-bride, and break your arms, along with the arms of your couch.<BR>
 In spite of all the decorations which you have made, O soul-bride, your Husband Lord is enjoying someone else.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 002</H2></CENTER>
 You don't have the bracelets of gold, nor the good crystal jewelry; you haven't dealt with the true jeweller.<BR>
 Those arms, which do not embrace the neck of the Husband Lord, burn in anguish.<BR>
 All my companions have gone to enjoy their Husband Lord; which door should I, the wretched one, go to?<BR>
 O friend, I may look very attractive, but I am not pleasing to my Husband Lord at all.<BR>
 I have woven my hair into lovely braids, and saturated their partings with vermillion;<BR>
 but when I go before Him, I am not accepted, and I die, suffering in anguish.<BR>
 I weep; the whole world weeps; even the birds of the forest weep with me.<BR>
 The only thing which doesn't weep is my body's sense of separateness, which has separated me from my Lord.<BR>
 In a dream, He came, and went away again; I cried so many tears.<BR>
 I can't come to You, O my Beloved, and I can't send anyone to You.<BR>
 Come to me, O blessed sleep - perhaps I will see my Husband Lord again.<BR>
 One who brings me a message from my Lord and Master - says Nanak, what shall I give to Him?<BR>
 Cutting off my head, I give it to Him to sit upon; without my head, I shall still serve Him.<BR>
 Why haven't I died? Why hasn't my life just ended? My Husband Lord has become a stranger to me. ||1||3||<BR>
 Wadahans, Third Mehl, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 When the mind is filthy, everything is filthy; by washing the body, the mind is not cleaned.<BR>
 This world is deluded by doubt; how rare are those who understand this. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, chant the One Name.<BR>
 The True Guru has given me this treasure. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Even if one learns the Yogic postures of the Siddhas, and holds his sexual energy in check,<BR>
 still, the filth of the mind is not removed, and the filth of egotism is not eliminated. ||2||<BR>
 This mind is not controlled by any other discipline, except the Sanctuary of the True Guru.<BR>
 Meeting the True Guru, one is transformed beyond description. ||3||<BR>
 Prays Nanak, one who dies upon meeting the True Guru, shall be rejuvenated through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 The filth of his attachment and possessiveness shall depart, and his mind shall become pure. ||4||1||<BR>
 Wadahans, Third Mehl:<BR>
 By His Grace, one serves the True Guru; by His Grace, service is performed.<BR>
 By His grace, this mind is controlled, and by His Grace, it becomes pure. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, think of the True Lord.<BR>
 Think of the One Lord, and you shall obtain peace; you shall never suffer in sorrow again. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 By His Grace, one dies while yet alive, and by His Grace, the Word of the Shabad is enshrined in the mind.<BR>
 By His Grace, one understands the Hukam of the Lord's Command, and by His Command, one merges into the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 That tongue, which does not savor the sublime essence of the Lord - may that tongue be burned off!<BR>
 It remains attached to other pleasures, and through the love of duality, it suffers in pain. ||3||<BR>
 The One Lord grants His Grace to all; He Himself makes distinctions.<BR>
 O Nanak, meeting the True Guru, the fruits are obtained, and one is blessed with the Glorious Greatness of the Naam. ||4||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 003</H2></CENTER>
 Wadahans, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Emotional attachment to Maya is darkness; without the Guru, there is no wisdom.<BR>
 Those who are attached to the Word of the Shabad understand; duality has ruined the people. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, under Guru's Instruction, do good deeds.<BR>
 Dwell forever and ever upon the Lord God, and you shall find the gate of salvation. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Lord alone is the treasure of virtue; He Himself gives, and then one receives.<BR>
 Without the Name, all are separated from the Lord; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one meets the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Acting in ego, they lose, and nothing comes into their hands.<BR>
 Meeting the True Guru, they find Truth, and merge into the True Name. ||3||<BR>
 Hope and desire abide in this body, but the Lord's Light shines within as well.<BR>
 O Nanak, the self-willed manmukhs remain in bondage; the Gurmukhs are liberated. ||4||3||<BR>
 Wadahans, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The faces of the happy soul-brides are radiant forever; through the Guru, they are peacefully poised.<BR>
 They enjoy their Husband Lord constantly, eradicating their ego from within. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 The True Guru has led me to understand the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The abandoned brides cry out in their suffering; they do not attain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.<BR>
 In the love of duality, they appear so ugly; they suffer in pain as they go to the world beyond. ||2||<BR>
 The virtuous soul-bride constantly chants the Glorious Praises of the Lord; she enshrines the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within her heart.<BR>
 The unvirtuous woman suffers, and cries out in pain. ||3||<BR>
 The One Lord and Master is the Husband Lord of all; His Praises cannot be expressed.<BR>
 O Nanak, He has separated some from Himself, while others are to His Name. ||4||4||<BR>
 Wadahans, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam is always sweet to me; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I come to taste it.<BR>
 Through the True Word of the Guru's Bani, I am merged in peace and poise; the Dear Lord is enshrined in the mind. ||1||<BR>
 The Lord, showing His Mercy, has caused me to meet the True Guru.<BR>
 Through the Perfect True Guru, I meditate on the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Through Brahma, the hymns of the Vedas were revealed, but the love of Maya spread.<BR>
 The wise one, Shiva, remains absorbed in himself, but he is engrossed in dark passions and excessive egotism. ||2||<BR>
 Vishnu is always busy reincarnating himself - who will save the world?<BR>
 The Gurmukhs are imbued with spiritual wisdom in this age; they are rid of the darkness of emotional attachment. ||3||<BR>
 Serving the True Guru, one is emancipated; the Gurmukh crosses over the world-ocean.<BR>
 The detached renunciates are imbued with the True Name; they attain the gate of salvation. ||4||<BR>
 The One True Lord is pervading and permeating everywhere; He cherishes everyone.<BR>
 O Nanak, without the One Lord, I do not know any other; He is the Merciful Master of all. ||5||5||<BR>
 Wadahans, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The Gurmukh practices true self-discipline, and attains the essence of wisdom.<BR>
 The Gurmukh meditates on the True Lord. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 004</H2></CENTER>
 As Gurmukh, O my mind, remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 It shall stand by you always, and go with you. ||Pause||<BR>
 The True Lord is the social status and honor of the Gurmukh.<BR>
 Within the Gurmukh, is God, his friend and helper. ||2||<BR>
 He alone becomes Gurmukh, whom the Lord so blesses.<BR>
 He Himself blesses the Gurmukh with greatness. ||3||<BR>
 The Gurmukh lives the True Word of the Shabad, and practices good deeds.<BR>
 The Gurmukh, O Nanak, emancipates his family and relations. ||4||6||<BR>
 Wadahans, Third Mehl:<BR>
 My tongue is intuitively attracted to the taste of the Lord.<BR>
 My mind is satisfied, meditating on the Name of the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Lasting peace is obtained, contemplating the Shabad, the True Word of God.<BR>
 I am forever a sacrifice to my True Guru. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 My eyes are content, lovingly focused on the One Lord.<BR>
 My mind is content, having forsaken the love of duality. ||2||<BR>
 The frame of my body is at peace, through the Shabad, and the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 The fragrance of the Naam permeates my heart. ||3||<BR>
 O Nanak, one who has such great destiny written upon his forehead,<BR>
 through the Bani of the Guru's Word, easily and intuitively becomes free of desire. ||4||7||<BR>
 Wadahans, Third Mehl:<BR>
 From the Perfect Guru, the Naam is obtained.<BR>
 Through the Shabad, the True Word of God, one merges in the True Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O my soul, obtain the treasure of the Naam,<BR>
 by submitting to the Will of your Guru. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, filth is washed away from within.<BR>
 The Immaculate Naam comes to abide within the mind. ||2||<BR>
 Deluded by doubt, the world wanders around.<BR>
 It dies, and is born again, and is ruined by the Messenger of Death. ||3||<BR>
 O Nanak, very fortunate are those who meditate on the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, they enshrine the Name within their minds. ||4||8||<BR>
 Wadahans, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Ego is opposed to the Name of the Lord; the two do not dwell in the same place.<BR>
 In egotism, selfless service cannot be performed, and so the soul goes unfulfilled. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, think of the Lord, and practice the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 If you submit to the Hukam of the Lord's Command, then you shall meet with the Lord; only then will your ego depart from within. ||Pause||<BR>
 Egotism is within all bodies; through egotism, we come to be born.<BR>
 Egotism is total darkness; in egotism, no one can understand anything. ||2||<BR>
 In egotism, devotional worship cannot be performed, and the Hukam of the Lord's Command cannot be understood.<BR>
 In egotism, the soul is in bondage, and the Naam, the Name of the Lord, does not come to abide in the mind. ||3||<BR>
 O Nanak, meeting with the True Guru, egotism is eliminated, and then, the True Lord comes to dwell in the mind||<BR>
 One starts practicing truth, abides in truth and by serving the True One gets absorbed in Him. ||4||9||12||<BR>
 Wadahans, Fourth Mehl, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 There is one bed, and One Lord God.<BR>
 The Gurmukh enjoys the Lord, the ocean of peace. ||1||<BR>
 My mind longs to meet my Beloved Lord.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 005</H2></CENTER>
 The Perfect Guru leads me to meet my Beloved; I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to my Guru. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 My body is over-flowing with corruption;<BR>
 how can I meet my Perfect Beloved? ||2||<BR>
 The virtuous ones obtain my Beloved;<BR>
 I do not have these virtues. How can I meet Him, O my mother? ||3||<BR>
 I am so tired of making all these efforts.<BR>
 Please protect Nanak, the meek one, O my Lord. ||4||1||<BR>
 Wadahans, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 My Lord God is so beautiful. I do not know His worth.<BR>
 Abandoning my Lord God, I have become entangled in duality. ||1||<BR>
 How can I meet with my Husband? I don't know.<BR>
 She who pleases her Husband Lord is a happy soul-bride. She meets with her Husband Lord - she is so wise. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I am filled with faults; how can I attain my Husband Lord?<BR>
 You have many loves, but I am not in Your thoughts, O my Husband Lord. ||2||<BR>
 She who enjoys her Husband Lord, is the good soul-bride.<BR>
 I don't have these virtues; what can I, the discarded bride, do? ||3||<BR>
 The soul-bride continually, constantly enjoys her Husband Lord.<BR>
 I have no good fortune; will He ever hold me close in His embrace? ||4||<BR>
 You, O Husband Lord, are meritorious, while I am without merit.<BR>
 I am worthless; please forgive Nanak, the meek. ||5||2||<BR>
 Wadahans, Fourth Mehl, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Within my mind there is such a great yearning; how will I attain the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan?<BR>
 I go and ask my True Guru; with the Guru's advice, I shall teach my foolish mind.<BR>
 The foolish mind is instructed in the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and meditates forever on the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 O Nanak, one who is blessed with the Mercy of my Beloved, focuses his consciousness on the Lord's Feet. ||1||<BR>
 I dress myself in all sorts of robes for my Husband, so that my True Lord God will be pleased.<BR>
 But my Beloved Husband Lord does not even cast a glance in my direction; how can I be consoled?<BR>
 For His sake, I adorn myself with adornments, but my Husband is imbued with the love of another.<BR>
 O Nanak, blessed, blessed, blessed is that soul-bride, who enjoys her True, Sublime Husband Lord. ||2||<BR>
 I go and ask the fortunate, happy soul-bride, "How did you attain Him - your Husband Lord, my God?"<BR>
 She answers, "My True Husband blessed me with His Mercy; I abandoned the distinction between mine and yours.<BR>
 Dedicate everything, mind, body and soul, to the Lord God; this is the Path to meet Him, O sister."<BR>
 If her God gazes upon her with favor, O Nanak, her light merges into the Light. ||3||<BR>
 I dedicate my mind and body to the one who brings me a message from my Lord God.<BR>
 I wave the fan over him every day, serve him and carry water for him.<BR>
 Constantly and continuously, I serve the Lord's humble servant, who recites to me the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 006</H2></CENTER>
 Hail, hail unto the Guru, the Guru, the Perfect True Guru, who fulfills Nanak's heart's desires. ||4||<BR>
 O Lord, let me meet the Guru, my best friend; meeting Him, I meditate on the Lord's Name.<BR>
 I seek the Lord's sermon from the Guru, the True Guru; joining with Him, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<BR>
 Each and every day, forever, I sing the Lord's Praises; my mind lives by hearing Your Name.<BR>
 O Nanak, that moment when I forget my Lord and Master - at that moment, my soul dies. ||5||<BR>
 Everyone longs to see the Lord, but he alone sees Him, whom the Lord causes to see Him.<BR>
 One upon whom my Beloved bestows His Glance of Grace, cherishes the Lord, Har, Har forever.<BR>
 He alone cherishes the Lord, Har, Har, forever and ever, who meets my Perfect True Guru.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Lord's humble servant and the Lord become One; meditating on the Lord, he blends with the Lord. ||6||1||3||<BR>
 Wadahans, Fifth Mehl, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 His Darbaar, His Court, is the most lofty and exalted.<BR>
 It has no end or limitations.<BR>
 Millions, millions, tens of millions seek,<BR>
 but they cannot find even a tiny bit of His Mansion. ||1||<BR>
 What is that auspicious moment, when God is met? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Tens of thousands of devotees worship Him in adoration.<BR>
 Tens of thousands of ascetics practice austere discipline.<BR>
 Tens of thousands of Yogis practice Yoga.<BR>
 Tens of thousands of pleasure seekers seek pleasure. ||2||<BR>
 He dwells in each and every heart, but only a few know this.<BR>
 Is there any friend who can rip apart the screen of separation?<BR>
 I can only make the effort, if the Lord is merciful to me.<BR>
 I sacrifice my body and soul to Him. ||3||<BR>
 After wandering around for so long, I have finally come to the Saints;<BR>
 all of my pains and doubts have been eradicated.<BR>
 God summoned me to the Mansion of His Presence, and blessed me with the Ambrosial Nectar of His Name.<BR>
 Says Nanak, my God is lofty and exalted. ||4||1||<BR>
 Wadahans, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Blessed is that time, when the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is given;<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to the feet of the True Guru. ||1||<BR>
 You are the Giver of souls, O my Beloved God.<BR>
 My soul lives by reflecting upon the Name of God. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 True is Your Mantra, Ambrosial is the Bani of Your Word.<BR>
 Cooling and soothing is Your Presence, all-knowing is Your gaze. ||2||<BR>
 True is Your Command; You sit upon the eternal throne.<BR>
 My eternal God does not come or go. ||3||<BR>
 You are the Merciful Master; I am Your humble servant.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Lord and Master is totally permeating and pervading everywhere. ||4||2||<BR>
 Wadahans, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 You are infinite - only a few know this.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, some come to understand You through the Word of the Shabad. ||1||<BR>
 Your servant offers this prayer, O Beloved:<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 007</H2></CENTER>
 I live by meditating on Your Feet, God. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 O my Merciful and Almighty God, O Great Giver,<BR>
 he alone knows You, whom You so bless. ||2||<BR>
 Forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to You.<BR>
 Here and hereafter, I seek Your Protection. ||3||<BR>
 I am without virtue; I know none of Your Glorious Virtues.<BR>
 O Nanak, seeing the Holy Saint, my mind is imbued with You. ||4||3||<BR>
 Wadahans, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 God is perfect - He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.<BR>
 He blesses us with the gift of the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||1||<BR>
 Bless me with Your Grace, God, O Merciful to the meek.<BR>
 I seek Your Protection, O Perfect Lord, Sustainer of the World. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He is totally pervading and permeating the water, the land and the sky.<BR>
 God is near at hand, not far away. ||2||<BR>
 One whom He blesses with His Grace, meditates on Him.<BR>
 Twenty-four hours a day, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 He cherishes and sustains all beings and creatures.<BR>
 Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord's Door. ||4||4||<BR>
 Wadahans, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 You are the Great Giver, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.<BR>
 God, the Perfect Lord and Master, is permeating and pervading in all. ||1||<BR>
 The Name of my Beloved God is my only support.<BR>
 I live by hearing, continually hearing Your Name. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I seek Your Sanctuary, O my Perfect True Guru.<BR>
 My mind is purified by the dust of the Saints. ||2||<BR>
 I have enshrined His Lotus Feet within my heart.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||3||<BR>
 Show mercy unto me, that I may sing Your Glorious Praises.<BR>
 O Nanak, chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, I obtain peace. ||4||5||<BR>
 Wadahans, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord.<BR>
 The soul does not die, nor does it ever waste away. ||1||<BR>
 By great good fortune, one meets the Perfect Guru.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, one meditates on God. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Lord is the jewel, the pearl, the gem, the diamond.<BR>
 Meditating, meditating in remembrance on God, I am in ecstasy. ||2||<BR>
 Wherever I look, I see the Sanctuary of the Holy.<BR>
 Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, my soul becomes immaculately pure. ||3||<BR>
 Within each and every heart, dwells my Lord and Master.<BR>
 O Nanak, one obtains the Naam, the Name of the Lord, when God bestows His Mercy. ||4||6||<BR>
 Wadahans, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Do not forget me, O God, Merciful to the meek.<BR>
 I seek Your Sanctuary, O Perfect, Compassionate Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Wherever You come to mind, that place is blessed.<BR>
 The moment I forget You, I am stricken with regret. ||1||<BR>
 All beings are Yours; You are their constant companion.<BR>
 Please, give me Your hand, and pull me up out of this world-ocean. ||2||<BR>
 Coming and going are by Your Will.<BR>
 One whom You save is not afflicted by suffering. ||3||<BR>
 You are the One and only Lord and Master; there is no other.<BR>
 Nanak offers this prayer with his palms pressed together. ||4||7||<BR>
 Wadahans, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 When You allow Yourself to be known, then we know You.<BR>
 We chant Your Name, which You have given to us. ||1||<BR>
 You are wonderful! Your creative potency is amazing! ||1||Pause||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 008</H2></CENTER>
 You Yourself are the Cause of causes, You Yourself are the Creator.<BR>
 By Your Will, we are born, and by Your Will, we die. ||2||<BR>
 Your Name is the Support of our mind and body.<BR>
 This is Your blessing to Nanak, Your slave. ||3||8||<BR>
 Wadahans, Fifth Mehl, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Deep within me, there is a longing to meet my Beloved; how can I attain my Perfect Guru?<BR>
 Even though a baby may play hundreds of games, he cannot survive without milk.<BR>
 The hunger within me is not satisfied, O my friend, even though I am served hundreds of dishes.<BR>
 My mind and body are filled with love for my Beloved; how can my soul find relief, without the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan? ||1||<BR>
 Listen, O my dear friends and siblings - lead me to my True Friend, the Giver of peace.<BR>
 He knows all the troubles of my soul; every day, he tells me stories of the Lord.<BR>
 I cannot live without Him, even for an instant. I cry out for Him, just as the song-bird cries for the drop of water.<BR>
 Which of Your Glorious Virtues should I sing? You save even worthless beings like me. ||2||<BR>
 I have become depressed, waiting for my Husband Lord, O my friend; when shall my eyes behold my Husband?<BR>
 I have forgotten how to enjoy all pleasures; without my Husband Lord, they are of no use at all.<BR>
 These clothes do not please my body; I cannot dress myself.<BR>
 I bow to those friends of mine, who have enjoyed their Beloved Husband Lord. ||3||<BR>
 I have adorned myself with all sorts of decorations, O my friend, but without my Husband Lord, they are of no use at all.<BR>
 When my Husband does not care for me, O my friend, then my youth passes, totally useless.<BR>
 Blessed, blessed are the happy soul-brides, O my friend, who are blended with their Husband Lord.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to those happy soul-brides; I wash their feet again and again. ||4||<BR>
 As long as I suffered from duality and doubt, O my friend, I thought God was far away.<BR>
 But when I met the Perfect True Guru, O my friend, then all my hopes and desires were fulfilled.<BR>
 I have obtained all pleasures and comforts, O my friend; my Husband Lord is all-pervading everywhere.<BR>
 Servant Nanak enjoys the Lord's Love, O my friend; I fall at the feet of the Guru, the True Guru. ||5||1||9||<BR>
 Wadahans, Third Mehl, Ashtapadees:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 True is the Bani of His Word, and True is the melody; True is contemplative meditation on the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 Night and day, I praise the True Lord. Blessed, blessed is my great good fortune. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, let yourself be a sacrifice to the True Name.<BR>
 If you become the slave of the Lord's slaves, you shall obtain the True Name. ||1||Pause||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 009</H2></CENTER>
 True is the tongue which is imbued with Truth, and true are the mind and body.<BR>
 By praising any other than the True Lord, one's whole life is wasted. ||2||<BR>
 Let Truth be the farm, Truth the seed, and Truth the merchandise you trade.<BR>
 Night and day, you shall earn the profit of the Lord's Name; you shall have the treasure overflowing with the wealth of devotional worship. ||3||<BR>
 Let Truth be your food, and let Truth be your clothes; let your True Support be the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 One who is so blessed by the Lord, obtains a seat in the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||4||<BR>
 In Truth we come, and in Truth we go, and then, we are not consigned to reincarnation again.<BR>
 The Gurmukhs are hailed as True in the True Court; they merge in the True Lord. ||5||<BR>
 Deep within they are True, and their minds are True; they sing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord.<BR>
 In the true place, they praise the True Lord; I am a sacrifice to the True Guru. ||6||<BR>
 True is the time, and true is the moment, when one falls in love with the True Lord.<BR>
 Then, he sees Truth, and speaks the Truth; he realizes the True Lord pervading the entire Universe. ||7||<BR>
 O Nanak, one merges with the True Lord, when He merges with Himself.<BR>
 As it pleases Him, He preserves us; He Himself ordains His Will. ||8||1||<BR>
 Wadahans, Third Mehl:<BR>
 His mind wanders in the ten directions - how can he sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord?<BR>
 The sensory organs are totally engrossed in sensuality; sexual desire and anger constantly afflict him. ||1||<BR>
 Waaho! Waaho! Hail! Hail! Chant His Glorious Praises.<BR>
 The Lord's Name is so difficult to obtain in this age; under Guru's Instruction, drink in the subtle essence of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Remembering the Word of the Shabad, the mind becomes immaculately pure, and then, one sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<BR>
 Under Guru's Instruction, one comes to understand his own self, and then, he comes to dwell in the home of his inner self. ||2||<BR>
 O my mind, be imbued forever with the Lord's Love, and sing forever the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<BR>
 The Immaculate Lord is forever the Giver of peace; from Him, one receives the fruits of his heart's desires. ||3||<BR>
 I am lowly, but I have been exalted, entering the Sanctuary of the Lord.<BR>
 He has lifted up the sinking stone; True is His glorious greatness. ||4||<BR>
 From poison, I have been transformed into Ambrosial Nectar; under Guru's Instruction, I have obtained wisdom.<BR>
 From bitter herbs, I have been transformed into sandalwood; this fragrance permeates me deep within. ||5||<BR>
 This human birth is so precious; one must earn the right to come into the world.<BR>
 By perfect destiny, I met the True Guru, and I meditate on the Lord's Name. ||6||<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs are deluded; attached to corruption, they waste away their lives in vain.<BR>
 The Name of the Lord is forever an ocean of peace, but the manmukhs do not love the Word of the Shabad. ||7||<BR>
 Everyone can chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har with their mouths, but only a few enshrine it within their hearts.<BR>
 O Nanak, those who enshrine the Lord within their hearts, attain liberation and emancipation. ||8||2||<BR>
 Wadahans, First Mehl, Chhant:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Why bother to wash the body, polluted by falsehood?<BR>
 One's cleansing bath is only approved, if he practices Truth.<BR>
 When there is Truth within the heart, then one becomes True, and obtains the True Lord.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 010</H2></CENTER>
 Without pre-ordained destiny, understanding is not attained; talking and babbling, one wastes his life away.<BR>
 Wherever you go and sit, speak well, and write the Word of the Shabad in your consciousness.<BR>
 Why bother to wash the body which is polluted by falsehood? ||1||<BR>
 When I have spoken, I spoke as You made me speak.<BR>
 The Ambrosial Name of the Lord is pleasing to my mind.<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Lord, seems so sweet to my mind; it has destroyed the dwelling of pain.<BR>
 Peace came to dwell in my mind, when You gave the Order.<BR>
 It is Yours to bestow Your Grace, and it is mine to speak this prayer; You created Yourself.<BR>
 When I have spoken, I spoke as You made me speak. ||2||<BR>
 The Lord and Master gives them their turn, according to the deeds they have done.<BR>
 Do not speak ill of others, or get involved in arguments.<BR>
 Do not get into arguments with the Lord, or you shall ruin yourself.<BR>
 If you challenge the One, with whom you must abide, you will cry in the end.<BR>
 Be satisfied with what God gives you; tell your mind not to complain uselessly.<BR>
 The Lord and Master gives them their turn, according to the deeds they have done. ||3||<BR>
 He Himself created all, and He blesses then with His Glance of Grace.<BR>
 No one asks for that which is bitter; everyone asks for sweets.<BR>
 Let everyone ask for sweets, and behold, it is as the Lord wills.<BR>
 Giving donations to charity, and performing various religious rituals are not equal to the contemplation of the Naam.<BR>
 O Nanak, those who are blessed with the Naam have had such good karma pre-ordained.<BR>
 He Himself created all, and He blesses them with His Glance of Grace. ||4||1||<BR>
 Wadahans, First Mehl:<BR>
 Show mercy to me, that I may chant Your Name.<BR>
 You Yourself created all, and You are pervading among all.<BR>
 You Yourself are pervading among all, and You link them to their tasks.<BR>
 Some, You have made kings, while others go about begging.<BR>
 You have made greed and emotional attachment seem sweet; they are deluded by this delusion.<BR>
 Be ever merciful to me; only then can I chant Your Name. ||1||<BR>
 Your Name is True, and ever pleasing to my mind.<BR>
 My pains are dispelled, and I am permeated with peace.<BR>
 The angels, the mortals and the silent sages sing of You.<BR>
 The angels, the mortals and the silent sages sing of You; they are pleasing to Your Mind.<BR>
 Enticed by Maya, they do not remember the Lord, and they waste away their lives in vain.<BR>
 Some fools and idiots never think of the Lord; whoever has come, shall have to go.<BR>
 Your Name is True, and ever pleasing to my mind. ||2||<BR>
 Beauteous is Your time, O Lord; the Bani of Your Word is Ambrosial Nectar.<BR>
 Your servants serve You with love; these mortals are attached to Your essence.<BR>
 Those mortals are attached to Your essence, who are blessed with the Ambrosial Name.<BR>
 Those who are imbued with Your Name, prosper more and more, day by day.<BR>
 Some do not practice good deeds, or live righteously; nor do they practice self-restraint. They do not realize the One Lord.<BR>
 Ever beauteous is Your time, O Lord; the Bani of Your Word is Ambrosial Nectar. ||3||<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to the True Name.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 011</H2></CENTER>
 Your rule shall never end.<BR>
 Your rule is eternal and unchanging; it shall never come to an end.<BR>
 He alone becomes Your servant, who contemplates You in peaceful ease.<BR>
 Enemies and pains shall never touch him, and sin shall never draw near him.<BR>
 I am forever a sacrifice to the One Lord, and Your Name. ||4||<BR>
 Throughout the ages, Your devotees sing the Kirtan of Your Praises, O Lord Master, at Your Door.<BR>
 They meditate on the One True Lord.<BR>
 Only then do they meditate on the True Lord, when they enshrine Him in their minds.<BR>
 Doubt and delusion are Your making; when these are dispelled,<BR>
 then, by Guru's Grace, You grant Your Grace, and save them from the noose of Death.<BR>
 Throughout the ages, they are Your devotees. ||5||<BR>
 O my Great Lord and Master, You are unfathomable and infinite.<BR>
 How should I make and offer my prayer? I do not know what to say.<BR>
 If You bless me with Your Glance of Grace, I realize the Truth.<BR>
 Only then do I come to realize the Truth, when You Yourself instruct me.<BR>
 The pain and hunger of the world are Your making; dispel this doubt.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, ones skepticism is taken away, when he understands the Guru's wisdom.<BR>
 The Great Lord Master is unfathomable and infinite. ||6||<BR>
 Your eyes are so beautiful, and Your teeth are delightful.<BR>
 Your nose is so graceful, and Your hair is so long.<BR>
 Your body is so precious, cast in gold.<BR>
 His body is cast in gold, and He wears Krishna's mala; meditate on Him, O sisters.<BR>
 You shall not have to stand at Death's door, O sisters, if you listen to these teachings.<BR>
 From a crane, you shall be transformed into a swan, and the filth of your mind shall be removed.<BR>
 Your eyes are so beautiful, and Your teeth are delightful. ||7||<BR>
 Your walk is so graceful, and Your speech is so sweet.<BR>
 You coo like a songbird, and your youthful beauty is alluring.<BR>
 Your youthful beauty is so alluring; it pleases You, and it fulfills the heart's desires.<BR>
 Like an elephant, You step with Your Feet so carefully; You are satisfied with Yourself.<BR>
 She who is imbued with the Love of such a Great Lord, flows intoxicated, like the waters of the Ganges.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, I am Your slave, O Lord; Your walk is so graceful, and Your speech is so sweet. ||8||2||<BR>
 Wadahans, Third Mehl, Chhant:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Let yourself be imbued with the Love of your Husband Lord, O beautiful, mortal bride.<BR>
 Let yourself remain merged in the True Word of the Shabad, O mortal bride; savor and enjoy the Love of your Beloved Husband Lord.<BR>
 The Husband Lord embellishes His beloved bride with His True Love; she is in love with the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 Renouncing her self-centeredness, she attains her Husband Lord, and remains merged in the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 That soul bride is adorned, who is attracted by His Love, and who treasures the Love of her Beloved within her heart.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Lord blends that soul bride with Himself; the True King adorns her. ||1||<BR>
 O worthless bride, see your Husband Lord ever-present.<BR>
 One who, as Gurmukh, enjoys her Husband Lord, O mortal bride, knows Him to be all-pervading everywhere.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 012</H2></CENTER>
 The Lord is all-pervading everywhere; behold Him ever-present. Throughout the ages, know Him as the One.<BR>
 The young, innocent bride enjoys her Husband Lord; she meets Him, the Architect of karma.<BR>
 One who tastes the sublime essence of the Lord, and utters the sublime Word of the Shabad, remains immersed in the Lord's Ambrosial Pool.<BR>
 O Nanak, that soul bride is pleasing to her Husband Lord, who, through the Shabad, remains in His Presence. ||2||<BR>
 Go and ask the happy soul-brides, O mortal bride, who have eradicated their self-conceit from within.<BR>
 Those who have not eradicated their self-conceit, O mortal bride, do not realize the Hukam of their Husband Lord's Command.<BR>
 Those who eradicate their self-conceit, obtain their Husband Lord; they delight in His Love.<BR>
 Ever imbued with His Love, in perfect poise and grace, she repeats His Name, night and day.<BR>
 Very fortunate is that bride, who focuses her consciousness on Him; her Lord's Love is so sweet to her.<BR>
 O Nanak, that soul-bride who is adorned with Truth, is imbued with her Lord's Love, in the state of perfect poise. ||3||<BR>
 Overcome your egotism, O mortal bride, and walk in the Guru's Way.<BR>
 Thus you shall ever enjoy your Husband Lord, O mortal bride, and obtain an abode in the home of your own inner being.<BR>
 Obtaining an abode in the home of her inner being, she vibrates the Word of the Shabad, and is a happy soul-bride forever.<BR>
 The Husband Lord is delightful, and forever young; night and day, He embellishes His bride.<BR>
 Her Husband Lord activates the destiny written on her forehead, and she is adorned with the True Shabad.<BR>
 O Nanak, the soul-bride is imbued with the Love of the Lord, when she walks according to the Will of the True Guru. ||4||1||<BR>
 Wadahans, Third Mehl:<BR>
 All dealings of the Gurmukh are good, if they are accomplished with poise and grace.<BR>
 Night and day, he repeats the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and he earns his profits, drinking in the subtle essence of the Lord.<BR>
 He earns the profit of the subtle essence of the Lord, meditating on the Lord, and repeating the Naam, night and day.<BR>
 He gathers in merits, and eliminates demerits, and realizes his own self.<BR>
 Under Guru's Instruction, he is blessed with glorious greatness; he drinks in the essence of the True Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 O Nanak, devotional worship of the Lord is wonderful, but only a few Gurmukhs perform it. ||1||<BR>
 As Gurmukh, plant the crop of the Lord within the field of your body, and let it grow.<BR>
 Within the home of your own being, enjoy the Lord's subtle essence, and earn profits in the world hereafter.<BR>
 This profit is earned by enshrining the Lord within your mind; blessed is this farming and trade.<BR>
 Meditating on the Lord's Name, and enshrining Him within your mind, you shall come to understand the Guru's Teachings.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs have grown weary of this farming and trade; their hunger and thirst will not go away.<BR>
 O Nanak, plant the seed of the Name within your mind, and adorn yourself with the True Word of the Shabad. ||2||<BR>
 Those humble beings engage in the Lord's Trade, who have the jewel of such pre-ordained destiny upon their foreheads.<BR>
 Under Guru's Instruction, the soul dwells in the home of the self; through the True Word of the Shabad, she becomes unattached.<BR>
 By the destiny written upon their foreheads, they become truly unattached, and by reflective meditation, they are imbued with Truth.<BR>
 Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the whole world is insane; through the Shabad, the ego is conquered.<BR>
 Attached to the True Word of the Shabad, wisdom comes forth. The Gurmukh obtains the Naam, the Name of the Husband Lord.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 013</H2></CENTER>
 O Nanak, through the Shabad, one meets the Lord, the Destroyer of fear, and by the destiny written on her forehead, she enjoys Him. ||3||<BR>
 All farming and trading is by Hukam of His Will; surrendering to the Lord's Will, glorious greatness is obtained.<BR>
 Under Guru's Instruction, one comes to understand the Lord's Will, and by His Will, he is united in His Union.<BR>
 By His Will, one merges and easily blends with Him. The Shabads of the Guru are incomparable.<BR>
 Through the Guru, true greatness is obtained, and one is embellished with Truth.<BR>
 He finds the Destroyer of fear, and eradicates his self-conceit; as Gurmukh, he is united in His Union.<BR>
 Says Nanak, the Name of the immaculate, inaccessible, unfathomable Commander is permeating and pervading everywhere. ||4||2||<BR>
 Wadahans, Third Mehl:<BR>
 O my mind, contemplate the True Lord forever.<BR>
 Dwell in peace in the home of your own self, and the Messenger of Death shall not touch you.<BR>
 The noose of the Messenger of Death shall not touch you, when you embrace love for the True Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 Ever imbued with the True Lord, the mind becomes immaculate, and its coming and going is ended.<BR>
 The love of duality and doubt have ruined the self-willed manmukh, who is lured away by the Messenger of Death.<BR>
 Says Nanak, listen, O my mind: contemplate the True Lord forever. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, the treasure is within you; do not search for it on the outside.<BR>
 Eat only that which is pleasing to the Lord, and as Gurmukh, receive the blessing of His Glance of Grace.<BR>
 As Gurmukh, receive the blessing of His Glance of Grace, O my mind; the Name of the Lord, your help and support, is within you.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs are blind, and devoid of wisdom; they are ruined by the love of duality.<BR>
 Without the Name, no one is emancipated. All are bound by the Messenger of Death.<BR>
 O Nanak, the treasure is within you; do not search for it on the outside. ||2||<BR>
 O my mind, obtaining the blessing of this human birth, some are engaged in the trade of Truth.<BR>
 They serve their True Guru, and the Infinite Word of the Shabad resounds within them.<BR>
 Within them is the Infinite Shabad, and the Beloved Naam, the Name of the Lord; through the Naam, the nine treasures are obtained.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs are engrossed in emotional attachment to Maya; they suffer in pain, and through duality, they lose their honor.<BR>
 But those who conquer their ego, and merge in the True Shabad, are totally imbued with Truth.<BR>
 O Nanak, it is so difficult to obtain this human life; the True Guru imparts this understanding. ||3||<BR>
 O my mind, those who serve their True Guru are the most fortunate beings.<BR>
 Those who conquer their minds are beings of renunciation and detachment.<BR>
 They are beings of renunciation and detachment, who lovingly focus their consciousness on the True Lord; they realize and understand their own selves.<BR>
 Their intellect is steady, deep and profound; as Gurmukh, they naturally chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Some are lovers of beautiful young women; emotional attachment to Maya is very dear to them. The unfortunate self-willed manmukhs remain asleep.<BR>
 O Nanak, those who intuitively serve their Guru, have perfect destiny. ||4||3||<BR>
 Wadahans, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Purchase the jewel, the invaluable treasure; the True Guru has given this understanding.<BR>
 The profit of profits is the devotional worship of the Lord; one's virtues merge into the virtues of the Lord.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 014</H2></CENTER>
 One's virtues merge into the virtues of the Lord; he comes to understand his own self. He earns the profit of devotional worship in this world.<BR>
 Without devotion, there is no peace; through duality, one's honor is lost, but under Guru's Instruction, he is blessed with the Support of the Naam.<BR>
 He ever earns the profit of the merchandise of the Naam, whom the Lord employs in this Trade.<BR>
 He purchases the jewel, the invaluable treasure, unto whom the True Guru has given this understanding. ||1||<BR>
 The love of Maya is totally painful; this is a bad deal.<BR>
 Speaking falsehood, one eats poison, and the evil within increases greatly.<BR>
 The evil within increases greatly, in this world of doubt; without the Name, one's honor is lost.<BR>
 Reading and studying, the religious scholars argue and debate; but without understanding, there is no peace.<BR>
 Their comings and goings never end; emotional attachment to Maya is dear to them.<BR>
 The love of Maya is totally painful; this is a bad deal. ||2||<BR>
 The counterfeit and the genuine are all assayed in the Court of the True Lord.<BR>
 The counterfeit are cast out of the Court, and they stand there, crying out in misery.<BR>
 They stand there, crying out in misery; the foolish, idiotic, self-willed manmukhs have wasted their lives.<BR>
 Maya is the poison which has deluded the world; it does not love the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs are resentful toward the Saints; they harvest only pain in this world.<BR>
 The counterfeit and the genuine are assayed in that True Court of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 He Himself acts; who else should I ask? No one else can do anything.<BR>
 As He pleases, He engages us; such is His glorious greatness.<BR>
 Such is His glorious greatness - He Himself causes all to act; no one is a warrior or a coward.<BR>
 The Life of the World, the Great Giver, the Architect of karma - He Himself grants forgiveness.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, self-conceit is eradicated, O Nanak, and through the Naam, honor is obtained.<BR>
 He Himself acts; who else should I ask? No one else can do anything. ||4||4||<BR>
 Wadahans, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The True merchandise is the Lord's Name. This is the true trade.<BR>
 Under Guru's Instruction, we trade in the Lord's Name; its value is very great.<BR>
 The value of this true trade is very great; those who are engaged in the true trade are very fortunate.<BR>
 Inwardly and outwardly, they are imbued with devotion, and they enshrine love for the True Name.<BR>
 One who is blessed with the Lord's Favor, obtains Truth, and reflects upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 O Nanak, those who are imbued with the Name find peace; they deal only in the True Name. ||1||<BR>
 Egotistical involvement in Maya is filth; Maya is overflowing with filth.<BR>
 Under Guru's Instruction, the mind is made pure and the tongue tastes the subtle essence of the Lord.<BR>
 The tongue tastes the subtle essence of the Lord, and deep within, the heart is drenched with His Love, contemplating the True Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 Deep within, the well of the heart is overflowing with the Lord's Ambrosial Nectar; the water-carrier draws and drinks in the water of the Shabad.<BR>
 One who is blessed with the Lord's favor is attuned to the Truth; with his tongue, he chants the Lord's Name.<BR>
 O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are immaculate. The others are full of the filth of egotism. ||2||<BR>
 All the religious scholars and astrologers read and study, and argue and shout. Who are they trying to teach?<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 015</H2></CENTER>
 The filth of attachment to Maya clings to their hearts; they deal in Maya alone.<BR>
 They love to deal in Maya in this world; coming and going, they suffer in pain.<BR>
 The worm of poison is addicted to poison; it is immersed in manure.<BR>
 He does what is pre-ordained for him; no one can erase his destiny.<BR>
 O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, lasting peace is found; the ignorant fools die screaming. ||3||<BR>
 Their minds are colored by emotional attachment to Maya; because of this emotional attachment, they do not understand.<BR>
 The soul of the Gurmukh is imbued with the Lord's Love; the love of duality departs.<BR>
 The love of duality departs, and the soul merges in Truth; the warehouse is overflowing with Truth.<BR>
 One who becomes Gurmukh, comes to understand; the Lord embellishes him with Truth.<BR>
 He alone merges with the Lord, whom the Lord causes to merge; nothing else can be said or done.<BR>
 O Nanak, without the Name, one is deluded by doubt; but some, imbued with the Name, enshrine love for the Lord. ||4||5||<BR>
 Wadahans, Third Mehl:<BR>
 O my mind, the world comes and goes in birth and death; only the True Name shall emancipate you in the end.<BR>
 When the True Lord Himself grants forgiveness, then one does not have to enter the cycle of reincarnation again.<BR>
 He does not have to enter the cycle of reincarnation again, and he is emancipated in the end; as Gurmukh, he obtains glorious greatness.<BR>
 Imbued with love for the True Lord, he is intoxicated with celestial bliss, and he remains absorbed in the Celestial Lord.<BR>
 The True Lord is pleasing to his mind; he enshrines the True Lord in his mind; attuned to the Word of the Shabad, he is emancipated in the end.<BR>
 O Nanak, those who are imbued with the Naam, merge in the True Lord; they are not cast into the terrifying world-ocean again. ||1||<BR>
 Emotional attachment to Maya is total madness; through the love of duality, one is ruined.<BR>
 Mother and father - all are subject to this love; in this love, they are entangled.<BR>
 They are entangled in this love, on account of their past actions, which no one can erase.<BR>
 The One who created the Universe, beholds it; no other is as great as He.<BR>
 The blind, self-willed manmukh is consumed by his burning rage; without the Word of the Shabad, peace is not obtained.<BR>
 O Nanak, without the Name, everyone is deluded, ruined by emotional attachment to Maya. ||2||<BR>
 Seeing that this world on fire, I have hurried to the Sanctuary of the Lord.<BR>
 I offer my prayer to the Perfect Guru: please save me, and bless me with Your glorious greatness.<BR>
 Preserve me in Your Sanctuary, and bless me with the glorious greatness of the Name of the Lord; there is no other Giver as great as You.<BR>
 Those who are engaged in serving You are very fortunate; throughout the ages, they know the One Lord.<BR>
 You may practice celibacy, truth, austere self-discipline and rituals, but without the Guru, you shall not be emancipated.<BR>
 O Nanak, he alone understands the Word of the Shabad, who goes and seeks the Lord's Sanctuary. ||3||<BR>
 That understanding, imparted by the Lord, wells up; there is no other understanding.<BR>
 Deep within, and beyond as well, You alone are, O Lord; You Yourself impart this understanding.<BR>
 One whom He Himself blesses with this understanding, does not love any other. As Gurmukh, he tastes the subtle essence of the Lord.<BR>
 In the True Court, he is forever True; with love, he chants the True Word of the Shabad.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 016</H2></CENTER>
 Within his home, he finds the home of his own being; the True Guru blesses him with glorious greatness.<BR>
 O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam find the Mansion of the Lord's Presence; their understanding is true, and approved. ||4||6||<BR>
 Wadahans, Fourth Mehl, Chhant:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 My mind, my mind - the True Guru has blessed it with the Lord's Love.<BR>
 He has enshrined the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har, within my mind.<BR>
 The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, dwells within my mind; He is the Destroyer of all pain.<BR>
 By great good fortune, I have obtained the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan; blessed, blessed is my True Guru.<BR>
 While standing up and sitting down, I serve the True Guru; serving Him, I have found peace.<BR>
 My mind, my mind - the True Guru has blessed it with the Lord's Love. ||1||<BR>
 I live, I live, and I blossom forth, beholding the True Guru.<BR>
 The Name of the Lord, the Name of the Lord, He has implanted within me; chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I blossom forth.<BR>
 Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the heart-lotus blossoms forth, and through the Name of the Lord, I have obtained the nine treasures.<BR>
 The disease of egotism has been eradicated, suffering has been eliminated, and I have entered the Lord's state of celestial Samaadhi.<BR>
 I have obtained the glorious greatness of Name of the Lord from the True Guru; beholding the Divine True Guru, my mind is at peace.<BR>
 I live, I live, and I blossom forth, beholding the True Guru. ||2||<BR>
 If only someone would come, if only someone would come, and lead me to meet my Perfect True Guru.<BR>
 My mind and body, my mind and body - I cut my body into pieces, and I dedicate these to Him.<BR>
 Cutting my mind and body apart, cutting them into pieces, I offer these to the one, who recites to me the Words of the True Guru.<BR>
 My unattached mind has renounced the world; obtaining the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan, it has found peace.<BR>
 O Lord, Har, Har, O Giver of Peace, please, grant Your Grace, and bless me with the dust of the feet of the True Guru.<BR>
 If only someone would come, if only someone would come, and lead me to meet my Perfect True Guru. ||3||<BR>
 A Giver as great as the Guru, as great as the Guru - I cannot see any other.<BR>
 He blesses me with the gift of the Lord's Name, the gift of the Lord's Name; He is the Immaculate Lord God.<BR>
 Those who worship in adoration the Name of the Lord, Har, Har - their pain, doubts and fears are dispelled.<BR>
 Through their loving service, those very fortunate ones, whose minds are attached to the Guru's Feet, meet Him.<BR>
 Says Nanak, the Lord Himself causes us to meet the Guru; meeting the Almighty True Guru, peace is obtained.<BR>
 A Giver as great as the Guru, as great as the Guru - I cannot see any other. ||4||1||<BR>
 Wadahans, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 Without the Guru, I am - without the Guru, I am totally dishonored.<BR>
 The Life of the World, the Life of the World, the Great Giver has led me to meet and merge with the Guru.<BR>
 Meeting with the True Guru, I have merged into the Naam, the Name of the Lord. I chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and meditate on it.<BR>
 I was seeking and searching for Him, the Lord, my best friend, and I have found Him within the home of my own being.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 017</H2></CENTER>
 I see the One Lord, and I know the One Lord; I realize Him within my soul.<BR>
 Without the Guru, I am - without the Guru, I am totally dishonored. ||1||<BR>
 Those who have found the True Guru, the True Guru, the Lord God unites them in His Union.<BR>
 Their feet, their feet, I adore; I fall at their feet.<BR>
 O Lord, Har, Har, I adore the feet of those who meditate on the True Guru, and the Almighty Lord God.<BR>
 You are the Greatest Giver, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts; please, reward my faith, O Lord King.<BR>
 Meeting the Gursikh, my faith is rewarded; night and day, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<BR>
 Those who have found the True Guru, the True Guru, the Lord God unites them in His Union. ||2||<BR>
 I am a sacrifice, I am a sacrifice to the Gursikhs, my dear friends.<BR>
 They chant the Lord's Name, the Lord's Name; the Beloved Naam, the Name of the Lord, is my only Support.<BR>
 The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is the companion of my breath of life; without it, I cannot live for an instant or a moment.<BR>
 The Lord, Har, Har, the Giver of peace, shows His Mercy, and the Gurmukh drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar.<BR>
 The Lord blesses him with faith, and unites him in His Union; He Himself adorns him.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice, I am a sacrifice to the Gursikhs, my dear friends. ||3||<BR>
 The Lord Himself, the Lord Himself, is the Immaculate Almighty Lord God.<BR>
 The Lord Himself, the Lord Himself, unites us with Himself; that which He does, comes to pass.<BR>
 Whatever is pleasing to the Lord God, that alone comes to pass; nothing else can be done.<BR>
 Even by very clever tricks, He cannot be obtained; all have grown weary of practicing cleverness.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, servant Nanak beholds the Lord; without the Lord, I have no other at all.<BR>
 The Lord Himself, the Lord Himself, is the Immaculate Almighty Lord God. ||4||2||<BR>
 Wadahans, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 The Lord, the True Guru, the Lord, the True Guru - if only I could meet the Lord, the True Guru; His Lotus Feet are so pleasing to me.<BR>
 The darkness of my ignorance was dispelled, when the Guru applied the healing ointment of spiritual wisdom to my eyes.<BR>
 The True Guru has applied the healing ointment of spiritual wisdom to my eyes, and the darkness of ignorance has been dispelled.<BR>
 Serving the Guru, I have obtained the supreme status; I meditate on the Lord with every breath, and every morsel of food.<BR>
 Those, upon whom the Lord God has bestowed His Grace, are committed to the service of the True Guru.<BR>
 The Lord, the True Guru, the Lord, the True Guru - if only I could meet the Lord, the True Guru; His Lotus Feet are so pleasing to me. ||1||<BR>
 My True Guru, my True Guru is my Beloved; without the Guru, I cannot live.<BR>

 The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is my only companion in the end; the Guru, the True Guru, has implanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within me.<BR>
 There, where neither child nor spouse shall accompany you, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har shall emancipate you.<BR>
 Blessed, blessed is the True Guru, the Immaculate, Almighty Lord God; meeting Him, I meditate on the Name of the Lord.<BR>

 Those who have not obtained the Blessed Vision, the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the True Guru, the Almighty Lord God,<BR>
 they have fruitlessly, fruitlessly wasted their whole lives in vain.<BR>
 They have wasted away their whole lives in vain; those faithless cynics die a regretful death.<BR>
 They have the jewel-treasure in their own homes, but still, they are hungry; those unlucky wretches are far away from the Lord.<BR>
 O Lord, please, let me not see those who do not meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,<BR>

 Without the Guru, I have no other friend. The Guru, the True Guru, is my very breath of life.<BR>
 Says Nanak, the Guru has implanted the Naam within me; the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the True Name.<BR>
 I am a song-bird, I am a meek song-bird; I offer my prayer to the Lord. ||4||3||<BR>

 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 This body-horse was created by the Lord.<BR>
 Blessed is human life, which is obtained by virtuous actions.<BR>
 Human life is obtained only by the most virtuous actions; this body is radiant and golden.<BR>
 The Gurmukh is imbued with the deep red color of the poppy; he is imbued with the new color of the Lord's Name, Har, Har, Har.<BR>
 This body is so very beautiful; it chants the Name of the Lord, and it is adorned with the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 By great good fortune, the body is obtained; the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is its companion; O servant Nanak, the Lord has created it. ||1||<BR>
 I place the saddle on the body-horse, the saddle of realization of the Good Lord.<BR>
 Riding this horse, I cross over the terrifying world-ocean.<BR>
 The terrifying world-ocean is rocked by countless waves, but the Gurmukh is carried across.<BR>
 Embarking upon the boat of the Lord, the very fortunate ones cross over; the Guru, the Boatman, carries them across through the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 Night and day, imbued with the Lord's Love, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the Lord's lover loves the Lord.<BR>
 Servant Nanak has obtained the state of Nirvaanaa, the state of ultimate goodness, the state of the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 For a bridle in my mouth, the Guru has implanted spiritual wisdom within me.<BR>
 He has applied the whip of the Lord's Love to my body.<BR>
 Applying the whip of the Lord's Love to his body, the Gurmukh conquers his mind, and wins the battle of life.<BR>
 He trains his untrained mind with the Word of the Shabad, and drinks in the rejuvenating essence of the Lord's Nectar.<BR>
 Listen with your ears to the Word, uttered by the Guru, and attune your body-horse to the Lord's Love.<BR>
 Servant Nanak has crossed over the long and treacherous path. ||3||<BR>
 The transitory body-horse was created by the Lord.<BR>
 Blessed, blessed is that body-horse which meditates on the Lord God.<BR>
 Blessed and acclaimed is that body-horse which meditates on the Lord God; it is obtained by the merits of past actions.<BR>
 Riding the body-horse, one crosses over the terrifying world ocean; the Gurmukh meets the Lord, the embodiment of supreme bliss.<BR>
 The Lord, Har, Har, has perfectly arranged this wedding; the Saints have come together as a marriage party.<BR>
 Servant Nanak has obtained the Lord as his Spouse; joining together, the Saints sing the songs of joy and congratulations. ||4||1||5||<BR>
 Wadahans, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 The body is the Lord's horse; the Lord imbues it with the fresh and new color.<BR>
 From the Guru, I ask for the Lord's spiritual wisdom.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 020</H2></CENTER>
 I ask for the Lord's spiritual wisdom, and the Lord's sublime sermon; through the Name of the Lord, I have come to know His value and His state.<BR>
 The Creator has made my life totally fruitful; I chant the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 The Lord's humble servant begs for the Lord's Name, for the Lord's Praises, and for devotional worship of the Lord God.<BR>

 He obtains the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and he meditates on the Name of the Lord; by great good fortune, he assumes the color of the Lord's Love.<BR>

 Raag Wadahans, Fifth Mehl, Chhant, Fourth House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Meeting with the Guru, I have found my Beloved Lord God.<BR>
 I have made this body and mind a sacrifice, a sacrificial offering to my Lord.<BR>
 Dedicating my body and mind, I have crossed over the terrifying world-ocean, and shaken off the fear of death.<BR>

 One who is pleasing to God receives true honor. The Lord God blesses him with wealth.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 021</H2></CENTER>
 Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to such a humble being. O Lord, You bless all with Your bountiful blessings. ||2||<BR>
 When it pleases You, then I am satisfied and satiated.<BR>
 My mind is soothed and calmed, and all my thirst is quenched.<BR>
 My mind is soothed and calmed, the burning has ceased, and I have found so many treasures.<BR>
 All the Sikhs and servants partake of them; I am a sacrifice to my True Guru.<BR>
 I have become fearless, imbued with the Love of my Lord Master, and I have shaken off the fear of death.<BR>
 Slave Nanak, Your humble servant, lovingly embraces Your meditation; O Lord, be with me always. ||3||<BR>
 My hopes and desires have been fulfilled, O my Lord.<BR>
 I am worthless, without virtue; all virtues are Yours, O Lord.<BR>
 All virtues are Yours, O my Lord and Master; with what mouth should I praise You?<BR>
 You did not consider my merits and demerits; you forgave me in an instant.<BR>
 I have obtained the nine treasures, congratulations are pouring in, and the unstruck melody resounds.<BR>
 Says Nanak, I have found my Husband Lord within my own home, and all my anxiety is forgotten. ||4||1||<BR>
 Shalok:<BR>
 Why do you listen to falsehood? It shall vanish like a gust of wind.<BR>
 O Nanak, those ears are acceptable, which listen to the True Master. ||1||<BR>
 Chhant:<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to those who listen with their ears to the Lord God.<BR>
 Blissful and comfortable are those, who with their tongues chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 They are naturally embellished, with priceless virtues; they have come to save the world.<BR>
 God's Feet are the boat, which carries so many across the terrifying world-ocean.<BR>
 Those who are blessed with the favor of my Lord and Master, are not asked to render their account.<BR>
 Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who listen to God with their ears. ||1||<BR>
 Shalok:<BR>
 With my eyes, I have seen the Light of the Lord, but my great thirst is not quenched.<BR>
 O Nanak, those eyes are different, which behold my Husband Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Chhant:<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to those who have seen the Lord God.<BR>
 In the True Court of the Lord, they are approved.<BR>
 They are approved by their Lord and Master, and acclaimed as supreme; they are imbued with the Lord's Love.<BR>
 They are satiated with the sublime essence of the Lord, and they merge in celestial peace; in each and every heart, they see the all-pervading Lord.<BR>
 They alone are the friendly Saints, and they alone are happy, who are pleasing to their Lord and Master.<BR>
 Says Nanak, I am forever a sacrifice to those who have seen the Lord God. ||2||<BR>

 Pain is eliminated and doubt is dispelled from the body; chanting the Name of the Lord of the World, their victory is celebrated.<BR>
 They are rid of emotional attachment, their sins are erased, and their association with the five passions is broken off.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 022</H2></CENTER>
 Says Nanak, I am every bit a sacrifice to those, within whose hearts my Lord God abides. ||3||<BR>
 Shalok:<BR>
 Those who long for the Lord, are said to be His servants.<BR>
 Nanak knows this Truth, that the Lord is not different from His Saint. ||1||<BR>
 Chhant:<BR>
 As water mixes and blends with water,<BR>
 so does one's light mix and blend with the Lord's Light.<BR>
 Merging with the perfect, all-powerful Creator, one comes to know his own self.<BR>
 Then, he enters the celestial state of absolute Samaadhi, and speaks of the One and Only Lord.<BR>
 He Himself is unmanifest, and He Himself is liberated; He Himself speaks of Himself.<BR>
 O Nanak, doubt, fear and the limitations of the three qualities are dispelled, as one merges into the Lord, like water blending with water. ||4||2||<BR>
 Wadahans, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 God is the all-powerful Creator, the Cause of causes.<BR>
 He preserves the whole world, reaching out with His hand.<BR>
 He is the all-powerful, safe Sanctuary, Lord and Master, Treasure of mercy, Giver of peace.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to Your slaves, who recognize only the One Lord.<BR>
 His color and shape cannot be seen; His description is indescribable.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, hear my prayer, O God, Almighty Creator, Cause of causes. ||1||<BR>
 These beings are Yours; You are their Creator.<BR>
 God is the Destroyer of pain, suffering and doubt.<BR>
 Eliminate my doubt, pain and suffering in an instant, and preserve me, O Lord, Merciful to the meek.<BR>
 You are mother, father and friend, O Lord and Master; the whole world is Your child, O Lord of the World.<BR>
 One who comes seeking Your Sanctuary, obtains the treasure of virtue, and does not have to enter the cycle of birth and death again.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, I am Your slave. All beings are Yours; You are their Creator. ||2||<BR>
 Meditating on the Lord, twenty-four hours a day,<BR>
 the fruits of the heart's desires are obtained.<BR>
 Your heart's desires are obtained, meditating on God, and the fear of death is dispelled.<BR>
 I sing of the Lord of the Universe in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and my hopes are fulfilled.<BR>
 Renouncing egotism, emotional attachment and all corruption, we become pleasing to the Mind of God.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, day and night, meditate forever on the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||<BR>
 At the Lord's Door, the unstruck melody resounds.<BR>
 In each and every heart, the Lord, the Lord of the Universe, sings.<BR>
 The Lord of the Universe sings, and abides forever; He is unfathomable, profoundly deep, lofty and exalted.<BR>
 His virtues are infinite - none of them can be described. No one can reach Him.<BR>
 He Himself creates, and He Himself sustains; all beings and creatures are fashioned by Him.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, happiness comes from devotional worship of the Naam; at His Door, the unstruck melody resounds. ||4||3||<BR>
 Raag Wadahans, First Mehl, Fifth House, Alaahanees ~ Songs Of Mourning:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Blessed is the Creator, the True King, who has linked the whole world to its tasks.<BR>
 When one's time is up, and the measure is full, this dear soul is caught, and driven off.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 023</H2></CENTER>
 This dear soul is driven off, when the pre-ordained Order is received, and all the relatives cry out in mourning.<BR>
 The body and the swan-soul are separated, when one's days are past and done, O my mother.<BR>
 As is one's pre-ordained Destiny, so does one receive, according to one's past actions.<BR>
 Blessed is the Creator, the True King, who has linked the whole world to its tasks. ||1||<BR>
 Meditate in remembrance on the Lord and Master, O my Siblings of Destiny; everyone has to pass this way.<BR>
 These false entanglements last for only a few days; then, one must surely move on to the world hereafter.<BR>
 He must surely move on to the world hereafter, like a guest; so why does he indulge in ego?<BR>
 Chant the Name of the Lord; serving Him, you shall obtain peace in His Court.<BR>
 In the world hereafter, no one's commands will be obeyed. According to their actions, each and every person proceeds.<BR>
 Meditate in remembrance on the Lord and Master, O my Siblings of Destiny; everyone has to pass this way. ||2||<BR>
 Whatever pleases the Almighty Lord, that alone comes to pass; this world is an opportunity to please Him.<BR>
 The True Creator Lord is pervading and permeating the water, the land and the air.<BR>
 The True Creator Lord is invisible and infinite; His limits cannot be found.<BR>
 Fruitful is the coming of those, who meditate single-mindedly on Him.<BR>
 He destroys, and having destroyed, He creates; by His Order, He adorns us.<BR>
 Whatever pleases the Almighty Lord, that alone comes to pass; this world is an opportunity to please Him. ||3||<BR>
 Nanak: he alone truly weeps, O Baba, who weeps in the Lord's Love.<BR>
 One who weeps for the sake of worldly objects, O Baba, weeps totally in vain.<BR>
 This weeping is all in vain; the world forgets the Lord, and weeps for the sake of Maya.<BR>
 He does not distinguish between good and evil, and wastes away this life in vain.<BR>
 Everyone who comes here, shall have to leave; to act in ego is false.<BR>
 Nanak: he alone truly weeps, O Baba, who weeps in the Lord's Love. ||4||1||<BR>
 Wadahans, First Mehl:<BR>
 Come, O my companions - let us meet together and dwell upon the True Name.<BR>
 Let us weep over the body's separation from the Lord and Master; let us remember Him in contemplation.<BR>
 Let us remember the Lord and Master in contemplation, and keep a watchful eye on the Path. We shall have to go there as well.<BR>
 He who has created, also destroys; whatever happens is by His Will.<BR>
 Whatever He has done, has come to pass; how can we command Him?<BR>
 Come, O my companions - let us meet together and dwell upon the True Name. ||1||<BR>
 Death would not be called bad, O people, if one knew how to truly die.<BR>
 Serve your Almighty Lord and Master, and your path in the world hereafter will be easy.<BR>
 Take this easy path, and you shall obtain the fruits of your rewards, and receive honor in the world hereafter.<BR>
 Go there with your offering, and you shall merge in the True Lord; your honor shall be confirmed.<BR>
 You shall obtain a place in the Mansion of the Lord Master's Presence; being pleasing to Him, you shall enjoy the pleasures of His Love.<BR>
 Death would not be called bad, O people, if one knew how to truly die. ||2||<BR>
 The death of brave heroes is blessed, if it is approved by God.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 024</H2></CENTER>
 They alone are acclaimed as brave warriors in the world hereafter, who receive true honor in the Court of the Lord.<BR>
 They are honored in the Court of the Lord; they depart with honor, and they do not suffer pain in the world hereafter.<BR>
 They meditate on the One Lord, and obtain the fruits of their rewards. Serving the Lord, their fear is dispelled.<BR>
 Do not indulge in egotism, and dwell within your own mind; the Knower Himself knows everything.<BR>
 The death of brave heroes is blessed, if it is approved by God. ||3||<BR>
 Nanak: for whom should we mourn, O Baba? This world is merely a play.<BR>
 The Lord Master beholds His work, and contemplates His creative potency.<BR>
 He contemplates His creative potency, having established the Universe. He who created it, He alone knows.<BR>
 He Himself beholds it, and He Himself understands it. He Himself realizes the Hukam of His Command.<BR>
 He who created these things, He alone knows. His subtle form is infinite.<BR>
 Nanak: for whom should we mourn, O Baba? This world is merely a play. ||4||2||<BR>
 Wadahans, First Mehl, Dakhanee:<BR>
 The True Creator Lord is True - know this well; He is the True Sustainer.<BR>
 He Himself fashioned His Own Self; the True Lord is invisible and infinite.<BR>
 He brought together, and then separated, the two grinding stones of the earth and the sky; without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness.<BR>
 He created the sun and the moon; night and day, they move according to His Thought. ||1||<BR>
 O True Lord and Master, You are True. O True Lord, bless me with Your Love. ||Pause||<BR>
 You created the Universe; You are the Giver of pain and pleasure.<BR>
 You created woman and man, the love of poison, and emotional attachment to Maya.<BR>
 The four sources of creation, and the power of the Word, are also of Your making. You give Support to all beings.<BR>
 You have made the Creation as Your Throne; You are the True Judge. ||2||<BR>
 You created comings and goings, but You are ever-stable, O Creator Lord.<BR>
 In birth and death, in coming and going, this soul is held in bondage by corruption.<BR>
 The evil person has forgotten the Naam; he has drowned - what can he do now?<BR>
 Forsaking merit, he has loaded the poisonous cargo of demerits; he is a trader of sins. ||3||<BR>
 The beloved soul has received the Call, the Command of the True Creator Lord.<BR>
 The soul, the husband, has become separated from the body, the bride. The Lord is the Re-uniter of the separated ones.<BR>
 No one cares for your beauty, O beautiful bride.; the Messenger of Death is bound only by the Lord Commander's Command.<BR>
 He does not distinguish between young children and old people; he tears apart love and affection. ||4||<BR>
 The nine doors are closed by the True Lord's Command, and the swan-soul takes flight into the skies.<BR>
 The body-bride is separated, and defrauded by falsehood; she is now a widow - her husband's body lies dead in the courtyard.<BR>
 The widow cries out at the door, "The light of my mind has gone out, O my mother, with his death."<BR>
 So cry out, O soul-brides of the Husband Lord, and dwell on the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. ||5||<BR>
 Her loved one is cleansed, bathed in water, and dressed in silken robes.<BR>
 The musicians play, and the Bani of the True Lord's Words are sung; the five relatives feel as if they too are dead, so deadened are their minds.<BR>
 "Separation from my beloved is like death to me!" cries the widow. "My life in this world is cursed and worthless!"<BR>
 But she alone is approved, who dies, while yet still alive; she lives for the sake of the Love of her Beloved. ||6||<BR>
 So cry out in mourning, you who have come to mourn; this world is false and fraudulent.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 025</H2></CENTER>
 I too have been defrauded, chasing after worldly entanglements; my Husband Lord has forsaken me - I practice the evil deeds of a wife without a spouse.<BR>
 In each and every home, are the brides of the Husband Lord; they gaze upon their Handsome Lord with love and affection.<BR>
 I sing the Praises of my True Husband Lord, and through the Naam, the Name of my Husband Lord, I blossom forth. ||7||<BR>
 Meeting with the Guru, the soul-bride's dress is transformed, and she is adorned with Truth.<BR>
 Come and meet with me, O brides of the Lord; let's meditate in remembrance on the Creator Lord.<BR>
 Through the Naam, the soul-bride becomes the Lord's favorite; she is adorned with Truth.<BR>
 Do not sing the songs of separation, O Nanak; reflect upon God. ||8||3||<BR>
 Wadahans, First Mehl:<BR>
 The One who creates and dissolves the world - that Lord and Master alone knows His creative power.<BR>
 Do not search for the True Lord far away; recognize the Word of the Shabad in each and every heart.<BR>
 Recognize the Shabad, and do not think that the Lord is far away; He created this creation.<BR>
 Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one obtains peace; without the Naam, he plays a losing game.<BR>
 The One who established the Universe, He alone knows the Way; what can anyone say?<BR>
 The One who established the world cast the net of Maya over it; accept Him as your Lord and Master. ||1||<BR>
 O Baba, he has come, and now he must get up and depart; this world is only a way-station.<BR>
 Upon each and every head, the True Lord writes their destiny of pain and pleasure, according to their past actions.<BR>
 He bestows pain and pleasure, according to the deeds done; the record of these deeds stays with the soul.<BR>
 He does those deeds which the Creator Lord causes him to do; he attempts no other actions.<BR>
 The Lord Himself is detached, while the world is entangled in conflict; by His Command, He emancipates it.<BR>
 He may put this off today, but tomorrow he is seized by death; in love with duality, he practices corruption. ||2||<BR>
 The path of death is dark and dismal; the way cannot be seen.<BR>
 There is no water, no quilt or mattress, and no food there.<BR>
 He receives no food there, no honor or water, no clothes or decorations.<BR>
 The chain is put around his neck, and the Messenger of Death standing over his head strikes him; he cannot see the door of his home.<BR>
 The seeds planted on this path do not sprout; bearing the weight of his sins upon his head, he regrets and repents.<BR>
 Without the True Lord, no one is his friend; reflect upon this as true. ||3||<BR>
 O Baba, they alone are known to truly weep and wail, who meet together and weep, chanting the Praises of the Lord.<BR>
 Defrauded by Maya and worldly affairs, the weepers weep.<BR>
 They weep for the sake of worldly affairs, and they do not wash off their own filth; the world is merely a dream.<BR>
 Like the juggler, deceiving by his tricks, one is deluded by egotism, falsehood and illusion.<BR>
 The Lord Himself reveals the Path; He Himself is the Doer of deeds.<BR>
 Those who are imbued with the Naam, are protected by the Perfect Guru, O Nanak; they merge in celestial bliss. ||4||4||<BR>
 Wadahans, First Mehl:<BR>
 O Baba, whoever has come, will rise up and leave; this world is merely a false show.<BR>
 One's true home is obtained by serving the True Lord; real Truth is obtained by being truthful.<BR>
 By falsehood and greed, no place of rest is found, and no place in the world hereafter is obtained.<BR>
 No one invites him to come in and sit down. He is like a crow in a deserted home.<BR>
 Trapped by birth and death, he is separated from the Lord for such a long time; the whole world is wasting away.<BR>
 Greed, worldly entanglements and Maya deceive the world. Death hovers over its head, and causes it to weep. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 026</H2></CENTER>
 Come, O Baba, and Siblings of Destiny - let's join together; take me in your arms, and bless me with your prayers.<BR>
 O Baba, union with the True Lord cannot be broken; bless me with your prayers for union with my Beloved.<BR>
 Bless me with your prayers, that I may perform devotional worship service to my Lord; for those already united with Him, what is there to unite?<BR>
 Some have wandered away from the Name of the Lord, and lost the Path. The Word of the Guru's Shabad is the true game.<BR>
 Do not go on Death's path; remain merged in the Word of the Shabad, the true form throughout the ages.<BR>
 Through good fortune, we meet such friends and relatives, who meet with the Guru, and escape the noose of Death. ||2||<BR>
 O Baba, we come into the world naked, into pain and pleasure, according to the record of our account.<BR>
 The call of our pre-ordained destiny cannot be altered; it follows from our past actions.<BR>
 The True Lord sits and writes of ambrosial nectar, and bitter poison; as the Lord attaches us, so are we attached.<BR>
 The Charmer, Maya, has worked her charms, and the multi-colored thread is around everyone's neck.<BR>
 Through shallow intellect, the mind becomes shallow, and one eats the fly, along with the sweets.<BR>
 Contrary to custom, he comes into the Dark Age of Kali Yuga naked, and naked he is bound down and sent away again. ||3||<BR>
 O Baba, weep and mourn if you must; the beloved soul is bound and driven off.<BR>
 The pre-ordained record of destiny cannot be erased; the summons has come from the Lord's Court.<BR>
 The messenger comes, when it pleases the Lord, and the mourners begin to mourn.<BR>
 Sons, brothers, nephews and very dear friends weep and wail.<BR>
 Let him weep, who weeps in the Fear of God, cherishing the virtues of God. No one dies with the dead.<BR>
 O Nanak, throughout the ages, they are known as wise, who weep, remembering the True Lord. ||4||5||<BR>
 Wadahans, Third Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Praise God, the True Lord; He is all-powerful to do all things.<BR>

 Wadahans, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Listen, O brides of the Lord: serve your Beloved Husband Lord, and contemplate the Word of His Shabad.<BR>
 The worthless bride does not know her Husband Lord - she is deluded; forgetting her Husband Lord, she weeps and wails.<BR>
 She weeps, thinking of her Husband Lord, and she cherishes His virtues; her Husband Lord does not die, and does not leave.<BR>
 As Gurmukh, she knows the Lord; through the Word of His Shabad, He is realized; through True Love, she merges with Him.<BR>
 She who does not know her Husband Lord, the Architect of karma, is deluded by falsehood - she herself is false.<BR>
 Listen, O brides of the Lord: serve your Beloved Husband Lord, and contemplate the Word of His Shabad. ||1||<BR>
 He Himself created the whole world; the world comes and goes.<BR>
 The love of Maya has ruined the world; people die, to be re-born, over and over again.<BR>
 People die to be re-born, over and over again, while their sins increase; without spiritual wisdom, they are deluded.<BR>
 Without the Word of the Shabad, the Husband Lord is not found; the worthless, false bride wastes her life away, weeping and wailing.<BR>
 He is my Beloved Husband Lord, the Life of the World - for whom should I weep? They alone weep, who forget their Husband Lord.<BR>
 He Himself created the whole world; the world comes and goes. ||2||<BR>
 That Husband Lord is True, forever True; He does not die, and He does not leave.<BR>
 The ignorant soul-bride wanders in delusion; in the love of duality, she sits like a widow.<BR>
 She sits like a widow, in the love of duality; through emotional attachment to Maya, she suffers in pain. She is growing old, and her body is withering away.<BR>
 Whatever has come, all that shall pass away; through the love of duality, they suffer in pain.<BR>
 They do not see the Messenger of Death; they long for Maya, and their consciousness is attached to greed.<BR>
 That Husband Lord is True, forever True; He does not die, and He does not leave. ||3||<BR>
 Some weep and wail, separated from their Husband Lord; the blind ones do not know that their Husband is with them.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, they may meet with their True Husband, and cherish Him always deep within.<BR>
 She cherishes her Husband deep within herself - He is always with her; the self-willed manmukhs think that He is far away.<BR>
 This body rolls in the dust, and is totally useless; it does not realize the Presence of the Lord and Master.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 028</H2></CENTER>

 When the True Guru united me, then I was naturally united with my Husband Lord, and now, I keep Him clasped to my heart.<BR>
 I constantly, lovingly cherish my Beloved within my heart; through the True Guru, I see my Beloved.<BR>
 The cloak of Maya's love is false; wearing it, one slips and loses his footing.<BR>

 God, my Lord and Master, is the highest of all; how can I meet my Dear Beloved? ||2||<BR>

 Surrender body and soul to your Guru, and then you shall become happy; your thirst and pain shall be taken away.<BR>

 This body is frail; old age is overtaking it.<BR>
 Those who are protected by the Guru are saved, while others die, to be reincarnated; they continue coming and going.<BR>
 Others die, to be reincarnated; they continue coming and going, and in the end, they depart regretfully. Without the Name, there is no peace.<BR>
 As one acts here, so does he obtain his rewards; the self-willed manmukh loses his honor.<BR>
 In the City of Death, there is pitch darkness, and huge clouds of dust; neither sister nor brother is there.<BR>
 This body is frail; old age is overtaking it. ||1||<BR>
 The body becomes like gold, when the True Guru unites one with Himself.<BR>

 Merged in the True Name of the Lord, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; meeting my Beloved, I have found peace.<BR>
 I am in constant bliss, day and night; egotism has been dispelled from within me.<BR>
 I fall at the feet of those who enshrine the Naam within their consciousness.<BR>
 The body becomes like gold, when the True Guru unites one with Himself. ||2||<BR>
 We truly praise the True Lord, when the True Guru imparts understanding.<BR>
 Without the True Guru, they are deluded by doubt; going to the world hereafter, what face will they display?<BR>
 What face will they show, when they go there? They will regret and repent for their sins; their actions will bring them only pain and suffering.<BR>
 Those who are imbued with the Naam are dyed in the deep crimson color of the Lord's Love; they merge into the Being of their Husband Lord.<BR>
 I can conceive of no other as great as the Lord; unto whom should I go and speak?<BR>
 We truly praise the True Lord, when the True Guru imparts understanding. ||3||<BR>
 I fall at the feet of those who praise the Truest of the True.<BR>
 Those humble beings are true, and immaculately pure; meeting them, all filth is washed off.<BR>

 In this world, they earn only pain and suffering, and dying, they go to abide in hell.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs have filthy faces; they do not know the Word of the Shabad; in sexual desire and anger they waste away.<BR>
 They forsake the Fear of the True Guru, and because of their stubborn ego, their efforts do not come to fruition.<BR>

 Afflicted with pain, he wanders from house to house, and in the world hereafter, he receives double punishment.<BR>
 Peace does not come to his heart - he is not content to eat what comes his way.<BR>

 Instead of wearing these beggar's robes, it is better to be a householder, and give to others.<BR>
 Those who are attuned to the Word of the Shabad, acquire understanding; the others wander, deluded by doubt.<BR>

 Without the Guru, no one has found the Lord's Name, O my Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 The Lord blesses the Gurmukh with devotion. ||13||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 One who has no faith in the True Guru, and who does not love the Word of the Shabad,<BR>
 shall find no peace, even though he may come and go hundreds of times.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh meets the True Lord with natural ease; he is in love with the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 O mind, search for such a True Guru, by serving whom the pains of birth and death are dispelled.<BR>
 Doubt shall never afflict you, and your ego shall be burnt away through the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 The veil of falsehood shall be torn down from within you, and Truth shall come to dwell in the mind.<BR>
 Peace and happiness shall fill your mind deep within, if you act according to truth and self-discipline.<BR>
 O Nanak, by perfect good karma, you shall meet the True Guru, and then the Dear Lord, by His Sweet Will, shall bless you with His Mercy. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The whole world comes under the control of one whose home is filled with the Lord, the King.<BR>
 He is subject to no one else's rule, and the Lord, the King, causes everyone to fall at his feet.<BR>
 One may run away from the courts of other men, but where can one go to escape the Lord's Kingdom?<BR>
 The Lord is such a King, who abides in the hearts of His devotees; He brings the others, and makes them stand before His devotees.<BR>
 The glorious greatness of the Lord's Name is obtained only by His Grace; how few are the Gurmukhs who meditate on Him. ||14||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Without serving the True Guru, the people of the world are dead; they waste their lives away in vain.<BR>
 In love with duality, they suffer terrible pain; they die, and are reincarnated, and continue coming and going.<BR>
 They live in manure, and are reincarnated again and again.<BR>
 O Nanak, without the Name, the Messenger of Death punishes them; in the end, they depart regretting and repenting. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 In this world, there is one Husband Lord; all other beings are His brides.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 036</H2></CENTER>
 He enjoys the hearts of all, and yet He remains detached; He is unseen; He cannot be described.<BR>
 The Perfect Guru reveals Him, and through the Word of His Shabad, we come to understand Him.<BR>
 Those who serve their Husband Lord, become like Him; their egos are burnt away by His Shabad.<BR>
 He has no rival, no attacker, no enemy.<BR>
 His rule is unchanging and eternal; He does not come or go.<BR>
 Night and day, His servant serves Him, singing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord.<BR>
 Beholding the Glorious Greatness of the True Lord, Nanak blossoms forth. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Those whose hearts are forever filled with the Name of the Lord, have the Name of the Lord as their Protector.<BR>
 The Lord's Name is my father, the Lord's Name is my mother; the Lord's Name is my helper and friend.<BR>
 My conversation is with the Lord's Name, and my counseling is with the Lord's Name; the Lord's Name always takes care of me.<BR>
 The Lord's Name is my most beloved society, the Lord's Name is my ancestry, and the Lord's Name is my family.<BR>
 The Guru, the Lord Incarnate, has bestowed upon servant Nanak the Name of the Lord; in this world, and in the next, the Lord ever saves me. ||15||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Those who meet the True Guru, ever sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.<BR>
 The Lord's Name naturally fills their minds, and they are absorbed in the Shabad, the Word of the True Lord.<BR>
 They redeem their generations, and they themselves obtain the state of liberation.<BR>
 The Supreme Lord God is pleased with those who fall at the Guru's Feet.<BR>
 Servant Nanak is the Lord's slave; by His Grace, the Lord preserves his honor. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 In egotism, one is assailed by fear; he passes his life totally troubled by fear.<BR>
 Egotism is such a terrible disease; he dies, to be reincarnated - he continues coming and going.<BR>
 Those who have such pre-ordained destiny meet with the True Guru, God Incarnate.<BR>
 O Nanak, by Guru's Grace, they are redeemed; their egos are burnt away through the Word of the Shabad. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The Lord's Name is my immortal, unfathomable, imperishable Creator Lord, the Architect of Destiny.<BR>
 I serve the Lord's Name, I worship the Lord's Name, and my soul is imbued with the Lord's Name.<BR>
 I know of no other as great as the Lord's Name; the Lord's Name shall deliver me in the end.<BR>
 The Generous Guru has given me the Lord's Name; blessed, blessed are the Guru's mother and father.<BR>
 I ever bow in humble reverence to my True Guru; meeting Him, I have come to know the Lord's Name. ||16||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 One who does not serve the Guru as Gurmukh, who does not love the Lord's Name,<BR>
 and who does not savor the taste of the Shabad, shall die, and be reborn, over and over again.<BR>
 The blind, self-willed manmukh does not think of the Lord; why did he even come into the world?<BR>
 O Nanak, that Gurmukh, upon whom the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, crosses over the world-ocean. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 Only the Guru is awake; the rest of the world is asleep in emotional attachment and desire.<BR>
 Those who serve the True Guru and remain wakeful, are imbued with the True Name, the treasure of virtue.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 037</H2></CENTER>
 The blind, self-willed manmukhs do not think of the Lord; they are ruined through birth and death.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukhs meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; this is their destiny, pre-ordained by the Primal Lord God. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The Lord's Name is my food; eating the thirty-six varieties of it, I am satisfied and satiated.<BR>
 The Lord's Name is my clothing; wearing it, I shall never be naked again, and my desire to wear other clothing is gone.<BR>
 The Lord's Name is my business, the Lord's Name is my commerce; the True Guru has blessed me with its use.<BR>
 I record the account of the Lord's Name, and I shall not be subject to death again.<BR>
 Only a few, as Gurmukh, meditate on the Lord's Name; they are blessed by the Lord, and receive their pre-ordained destiny. ||17||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The world is blind and ignorant; in the love of duality, it engages in actions.<BR>
 But those actions which are performed in the love of duality, cause only pain to the body.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, peace wells up, when one acts according to the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 He acts according to the True Word of the Guru's Bani; night and day, he meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 O Nanak, as the Lord Himself engages him, so is he engaged; no one has any say in this matter. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 Within the home of my own being, is the everlasting treasure of the Naam; it is a treasure house, overflowing with devotion.<BR>
 The True Guru is the Giver of the life of the soul; the Great Giver lives forever.<BR>
 Night and day, I continually sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praise, through the Infinite Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 I recite continually the Guru's Shabads, which have been effective throughout the ages.<BR>
 This mind ever abides in peace, dealing in peace and poise.<BR>
 Deep within me is the Guru's Wisdom, the Lord's jewel, the Bringer of liberation.<BR>
 O Nanak, one who is blessed by the Lord's Glance of Grace obtains this, and is judged to be True in the Court of the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Blessed, blessed is that Sikh of the Guru, who goes and falls at the Feet of the True Guru.<BR>
 Blessed, blessed is that Sikh of the Guru, who with his mouth, utters the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Blessed, blessed is that Sikh of the Guru, whose mind, upon hearing the Lord's Name, becomes blissful.<BR>
 Blessed, blessed is that Sikh of the Guru, who serves the True Guru, and so obtains the Lord's Name.<BR>
 I bow forever in deepest respect to that Sikh of the Guru, who walks in the Way of the Guru. ||18||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 No one has ever found the Lord through stubborn-mindedness. All have grown weary of performing such actions.<BR>
 Through their stubborn-mindedness, and by wearing their disguises, they are deluded; they suffer in pain from the love of duality.<BR>
 Riches and the supernatural spiritual powers of the Siddhas are all emotional attachments; through them, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, does not come to dwell in the mind.<BR>
 Serving the Guru, the mind becomes immaculately pure, and the darkness of spiritual ignorance is dispelled.<BR>
 The jewel of the Naam is revealed in the home of one's own being; O Nanak, one merges in celestial bliss. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 12 - Raag Wadahans - Part 038</H2></CENTER>
 One who does not savor the taste of the Shabad, who does not love the Naam, the Name of the Lord,<BR>
 and who speaks insipid words with his tongue, is ruined, again and again.<BR>
 O Nanak, he acts according to the karma of his past actions, which no one can erase. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Blessed, blessed is the True Being, my True Guru; meeting Him, I have found peace.<BR>
 Blessed, blessed is the True Being, my True Guru; meeting Him, I have attained the Lord's devotional worship.<BR>

 Blessed, blessed is the Knower of the Lord, my True Guru; He has taught me to look upon friend and foe alike.<BR>
 Blessed, blessed is the True Guru, my best friend; He has led me to embrace love for the Name of the Lord. ||19||<BR>
 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
 The soul-bride is at home, while the Husband Lord is away; she cherishes His memory, and mourns His absence.<BR>
 She shall meet Him without delay, if she rids herself of duality. ||1||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 O Nanak, false is the speech of one who acts without loving the Lord.<BR>
 He judges things to be good, only as long as the Lord gives and he receives. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The Lord, who created the creatures, also protects them.<BR>
 I have tasted the food of Ambrosial Nectar, the True Name.<BR>
 I am satisfied and satiated, and my hunger is appeased.<BR>
 The One Lord is pervading in all, but rare are those who realize this.<BR>
 Servant Nanak is enraptured, in the Protection of God. ||20||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 All the living beings of the world behold the True Guru.<BR>
 One is not liberated by merely seeing Him, unless one contemplates the Word of His Shabad.<BR>
 The filth of ego is not removed, and he does not enshrine love for the Naam.<BR>
 The Lord forgives some, and unites them with Himself; they forsake their duality and sinful ways.<BR>
 O Nanak, some behold the Blessed Vision of the True Guru's Darshan, with love and affection; conquering their ego, they meet with the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 The foolish, blind clown does not serve the True Guru.<BR>
 In love with duality, he endures terrible suffering, and burning, he cries out in pain.<BR>
 He forgets the Guru, for the sake of mere objects, but they will not come to his rescue in the end.<BR>
 Through the Guru's Instructions, Nanak has found peace; the Forgiving Lord has forgiven him. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 You Yourself, all by Yourself, are the Creator of all. If there were any other, then I would speak of another.<BR>
 The Lord Himself speaks, and causes us to speak; He Himself is pervading the water and the land.<BR>
 The Lord Himself destroys, and the Lord Himself saves. O mind, seek and remain in the Lord's Sanctuary.<BR>
 Other than the Lord, no one can kill or rejuvenate. O mind, do not be anxious - remain fearless.<BR>
 While standing, sitting, and sleeping, forever and ever, meditate on the Lord's Name; O servant Nanak, as Gurmukh, you shall attain the Lord. ||21||1||SUDH||<BR>
