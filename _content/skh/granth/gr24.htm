<CENTER><H2>Section 24 - Raag Maale Gaaura - Part 001</H2></CENTER>
 Raag Maalee Gauraa, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<BR>
 Countless have tried, but none have found the Lord's limit.<BR>
 The Lord is inaccessible, unapproachable and unfathomable; I humbly bow to the Lord God, my King. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment bring continual conflict and strife.<BR>
 Save me, save me, I am your humble creature, O Lord; I have come to Your Sanctuary, O my Lord God. ||1||<BR>
 You protect and preserve those who take to Your Sanctuary, God; You are called the Lover of Your devotees.<BR>
 Prahlaad, Your humble servant, was caught by Harnaakhash; but You saved Him and carried him across, Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Remember the Lord, O mind, and rise up to the Mansion of His Presence; the Sovereign Lord is the Destroyer of pain.<BR>
 Our Lord and Master takes away the fear of birth and death; following the Guru's Teachings, the Lord God is found. ||3||<BR>
 The Name of the Lord, our Lord and Master, is the Purifier of sinners; I sing of the Lord, the Destroyer of the fears of His devotees.<BR>
 One who wears the necklace of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in his heart, O servant Nanak, merges in the Naam. ||4||1||<BR>
 Maalee Gauraa, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, the Giver of peace.<BR>
 One who joins the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and enjoys the sublime taste of the Lord, as Gurmukh, comes to realize God. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 By great good fortune, one obtains the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan; meeting with the Guru, the Lord God is known.<BR>
 The filth of evil-mindedness is totally washed away, bathing in the Lord's ambrosial pool of nectar. ||1||<BR>
 Blessed, blessed are the Holy, who have found their Lord God; I ask them to tell me the stories of the Lord.<BR>
 I fall at their feet, and always pray to them, to mercifully unite me with my Lord, the Architect of Destiny. ||2||<BR>
 Through the destiny written on my forehead, I have found the Holy Guru; my mind and body are imbued with the Guru's Word.<BR>
 The Lord God has come to meet me; I have found peace, and I am rid of all the sins. ||3||<BR>
 Those who follow the Guru's Teachings find the Lord, the source of nectar; their words are sublime and exalted.<BR>
 By great good fortune, one is blessed with the dust of their feet; servant Nanak falls at their feet. ||4||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 24 - Raag Maale Gaaura - Part 002</H2></CENTER>
 Maalee Gauraa, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 All the Siddhas, seekers and silent sages, with their minds full of love, meditate on the Lord.<BR>
 The Supreme Lord God, my Lord and Master, is limitless; the Guru has inspired me to know the unknowable Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I am low, and I commit evil actions; I have not remembered my Sovereign Lord.<BR>
 The Lord has led me to meet the True Guru; in an instant, He liberated me from bondage. ||1||<BR>
 Such is the destiny God wrote on my forehead; following the Guru's Teachings, I enshrine love for the Lord.<BR>
 The Panch Shabad, the five primal sounds, vibrate and resound in the Court of the Lord; meeting the Lord, I sing the songs of joy. ||2||<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the Purifier of sinners; the unfortunate wretches do not like this.<BR>
 They rot away in the womb of reincarnation; they fall apart like salt in water. ||3||<BR>
 Please bless me with such understanding, O Inaccessible Lord God, my Lord and Master, that my mind may remain attached to the Guru's feet.<BR>
 Servant Nanak remains attached to the Name of the Lord; he is merged in the Naam. ||4||3||<BR>
 Maalee Gauraa, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 My mind is addicted to the juice of the Lord's Name.<BR>
 My heart-lotus has blossomed forth, and I have found the Guru. Meditating on the Lord, my doubts and fears have run away. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 In the Fear of God, my heart is committed in loving devotion to Him; following the Guru's Teachings, my sleeping mind has awakened.<BR>
 All my sins have been erased, and I have found peace and tranquility; I have enshrined the Lord within my heart, by great good fortune. ||1||<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh is like the false color of the safflower, which fades away; its color lasts for only a few days.<BR>
 He perishes in an instant; he is tormented, and punished by the Righteous Judge of Dharma. ||2||<BR>
 The Lord's Love, found in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, is absolutely permanent, and colorfast.<BR>
 The cloth of the body may be torn to shreds, but still, this beautiful color of the Lord's Love does not fade away. ||3||<BR>
 Meeting with the Blessed Guru, one is dyed in the color of the Lord's Love, imbued with this deep crimson color.<BR>
 Servant Nanak washes the feet of that humble being, who is attached to the feet of the Lord. ||4||4||<BR>
 Maalee Gauraa, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 O my mind, meditate, vibrate upon the Name of the Lord, the Lord of the World, Har, Har.<BR>
 My mind and body are merged in the Lord's Name, and through the Guru's Teachings, my intellect is imbued with the Lord, the source of nectar. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Follow the Guru's Teachings, and meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Chant, and meditate, on the beads of the mala of the Lord.<BR>
 Those who have such destiny inscribed upon their foreheads, meet with the Lord, adorned with garlands of flowers. ||1||<BR>
 Those who meditate on the Name of the Lord - all their entanglements are ended.<BR>
 The Messenger of Death does not even approach them; the Guru, the Savior Lord, saves them. ||2||<BR>
 I am a child; I know nothing at all. The Lord cherishes me, as my mother and father.<BR>
 I continually put my hands into the fire of Maya, but the Guru saves me; He is merciful to the meek. ||3||<BR>
 I was filthy, but I have become immaculate. Singing the Lord's Praises, all sins have been burnt to ashes.<BR>
 My mind is in esctasy, having found the Guru; servant Nanak is enraptured through the Word of the Shabad. ||4||5||<BR>
 Maalee Gauraa, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 24 - Raag Maale Gaaura - Part 003</H2></CENTER>
 O my mind, meditate, vibrate on the Lord, and all sins will be eradicated.<BR>
 The Guru has enshried the Lord, Har, Har, within my heart; I place my head on the Guru's Path. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Whoever tells me the stories of my Lord God, I would cut my mind into slices, and dedicate it to him.<BR>
 The Perfect Guru has united me with the Lord, my Friend; I have sold myself at each and every store for the Guru's Word. ||1||<BR>
 One may give donations in charity at Prayaag, and cut the body in two at Benares,<BR>
 but without the Lord's Name, no one attains liberation, even though one may give away huge amounts of gold. ||2||<BR>
 When one follows the Guru's Teachings, and sings the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, the doors of the mind, held shut by deception, are thrown open again.<BR>
 The three qualities are shattered, doubt and fear run away, and the clay pot of public opinion is broken. ||3||<BR>
 They alone find the Perfect Guru in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, upon whose foreheads such pre-ordained destiny is inscribed.<BR>
 Servant Nanak drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar; all his hunger and thirst are quenched. ||4||6||<BR>
 Set of Six Hymns 1||<BR>
 Maalee Gauraa, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 O mind, true peace comes from serving the Lord.<BR>
 Other services are false, and as punishment for them, the Messenger of Death bashes in one's head. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 They alone join the Sangat, the Congregation, upon whose forehead such destiny is inscribed.<BR>
 They are carried across the terrifying world-ocean by the Saints of the Infinite, Primal Lord God. ||1||<BR>
 Serve forever at the feet of the Holy; renounce greed, emotional attachment and corruption.<BR>
 Abandon all other hopes, and rest your hopes in the One Formless Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Some are faithless cynics, deluded by doubt; without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness.<BR>
 Whatever is pre-ordained, comes to pass; no one can erase it. ||3||<BR>
 The beauty of the Lord of the Universe is profound and unfathomable; the Names of the Infinite Lord are immunerable.<BR>
 Blessed, blessed are those humble beings, O Nanak, who enshrine the Lord's Name in their hearts. ||4||1||<BR>

 Maalee Gauraa, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 This is the sort of helper the Name of the Lord is.<BR>
 Meditating in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, one's affairs are perfectly resolved. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 It is like a boat to a drowning man.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 24 - Raag Maale Gaaura - Part 004</H2></CENTER>
 It is like oil to the lamp whose flame is dying out.<BR>
 It is like water poured on the burning fire.<BR>
 It is like milk poured into the baby's mouth. ||1||<BR>
 As one's brother becomes a helper on the field of battle;<BR>
 as one's hunger is satisfied by food;<BR>
 as the cloudburst saves the crops;<BR>
 as one is protected in the tiger's lair;||2||<BR>
 As with the magic spell of Garuda the eagle upon one's lips, one does not fear the snake;<BR>
 as the cat cannot eat the parrot in its cage;<BR>
 as the bird cherishes her eggs in her heart;<BR>
 as the grains are spared, by sticking to the central post of the mill;||3||<BR>
 Your Glory is so great; I can describe only a tiny bit of it.<BR>
 O Lord, You are inaccessible, unapproachable and unfathomable.<BR>
 You are lofty and high, utterly great and infinite.<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, O Nanak, one is carried across. ||4||3||<BR>

 and with my eyes, I gaze upon the Blessed Vision of their Darshan, day and night.<BR>
 With my hands, I work for the Saints.<BR>
 I dedicate my breath of life, my mind and wealth to the Saints. ||1||<BR>
 My mind loves the Society of the Saints.<BR>
 The Virtues of the Saints abide within my consciousness.<BR>
 The Will of the Saints is sweet to my mind.<BR>
 Seeing the Saints, my heart-lotus blossoms forth. ||2||<BR>

 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Blessed, blessed is that flute which the Lord plays.<BR>
 The sweet, sweet unstruck sound current sings forth. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Blessed, blessed is the wool of the sheep;<BR>
 blessed, blessed is the blanket worn by Krishna. ||1||<BR>
 Blessed, blessed are you, O mother Dayvakee;<BR>
 into your home the Lord was born. ||2||<BR>
 Blessed, blessed are the forests of Brindaaban;<BR>
 the Supreme Lord plays there. ||3||<BR>
 He plays the flute, and herds the cows;<BR>
 Naam Dayv's Lord and Master plays happily. ||4||1||<BR>
 O my Father, Lord of wealth, blessed are You, long-haired, dark-skinned, my darling. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You hold the steel chakra in Your hand; You came down from Heaven, and saved the life of the elephant.<BR>
 In the court of Duhsaasan, You saved the honor of Dropati, when her clothes were being removed. ||1||<BR>
 You saved Ahliyaa, the wife of Gautam; how many have You purified and carried across?<BR>
 Such a lowly outcaste as Naam Dayv has come seeking Your Sanctuary. ||2||2||<BR>
 Within all hearts, the Lord speaks, the Lord speaks.<BR>
 Who else speaks, other than the Lord? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Out of the same clay, the elephant, the ant, and the many sorts of species are formed.<BR>
 In stationary life forms, moving beings, worms, moths and within each and every heart, the Lord is contained. ||1||<BR>
 Remember the One, Infinite Lord; abandon all other hopes.<BR>
 Naam Dayv prays, I have become dispassionate and detached; who is the Lord and Master, and who is the slave? ||2||3||<BR>
