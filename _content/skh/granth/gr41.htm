<CENTER><H2>Section 41 - Shaloks Of Shaykh Fareed Jee - Part 001</H2></CENTER>
 He obtains the treasure of liberation, and the difficult road to the Lord is not blocked. ||231||<BR>
 Kabeer, whether is is for an hour, half an hour, or half of that,<BR>
 whatever it is, it is worthwhile to speak with the Holy. ||232||<BR>
 Kabeer, those mortals who consume marijuana, fish and wine<BR>
 - no matter what pilgrimages, fasts and rituals they follow, they will all go to hell. ||233||<BR>
 Kabeer, I keep my eyes lowered, and enshrine my Friend within my heart.<BR>
 I enjoy all pleasures with my Beloved, but I do not let anyone else know. ||234||<BR>
 Twenty-four hours a day, every hour, my soul continues to look to You, O Lord.<BR>
 Why should I keep my eyes lowered? I see my Beloved in every heart. ||235||<BR>
 Listen, O my companions: my soul dwells in my Beloved, and my Beloved dwells in my soul.<BR>
 I realize that there is no difference between my soul and my Beloved; I cannot tell whether my soul or my Beloved dwells in my heart. ||236||<BR>
 Kabeer, the Brahmin may be the guru of the world, but he is not the Guru of the devotees.<BR>
 He rots and dies in the perplexities of the four Vedas. ||237||<BR>
 The Lord is like sugar, scattered in the sand; the elephant cannot pick it up.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, the Guru has given me this sublime understanding: become an ant, and feed on it. ||238||<BR>
 Kabeer, if you desire to play the game of love with the Lord, then cut off your head, and make it into a ball.<BR>
 Lose yourself in the play of it, and then whatever will be, will be. ||239||<BR>
 Kabeer, if you desire to play the game of love with the Lord, play it with someone with committment.<BR>
 Pressing the unripe mustard seeds produces neither oil nor flour. ||240||<BR>
 Searching, the mortal stumbles like a blind person, and does not recognize the Saint.<BR>
 Says Naam Dayv, how can one obtain the Lord God, without His devotee? ||241||<BR>
 Forsaking the Diamond of the Lord, the mortals put their hopes in another.<BR>
 Those people shall go to hell; Ravi Daas speaks the Truth. ||242||<BR>
 Kabeer, if you live the householder's life, then practice righteousness; otherwise, you might as well retire from the world.<BR>
 If someone renounces the world, and then gets involved in worldly entanglements, he shall suffer terrible misfortune. ||243||<BR>
 Shaloks Of Shaykh Fareed Jee:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The day of the bride's wedding is pre-ordained.<BR>
 On that day, the Messenger of Death, of whom she had only heard, comes and shows its face.<BR>
 It breaks the bones of the body and pulls the helpless soul out.<BR>
 That pre-ordained time of marriage cannot be avoided. Explain this to your soul.<BR>
 The soul is the bride, and death is the groom. He will marry her and take her away.<BR>
 After the body sends her away with its own hands, whose neck will it embrace?<BR>
 The bridge to hell is narrower than a hair; haven't you heard of it with your ears?<BR>
 Fareed, the call has come; be careful now - don't let yourself be robbed. ||1||<BR>
 Fareed, it is so difficult to become a humble Saint at the Lord's Door.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 41 - Shaloks Of Shaykh Fareed Jee - Part 002</H2></CENTER>
 I am so accustomed to walking in the ways of the world. I have tied and picked up the bundle; where can I go to throw it away? ||2||<BR>
 I know nothing; I understand nothing. The world is a smouldering fire.<BR>
 My Lord did well to warn me about it; otherwise, I would have been burnt as well. ||3||<BR>
 Fareed, if I had known that I had so few sesame seeds, I would have been more careful with them in my hands.<BR>
 If I had known that my Husband Lord was so young and innocent, I would not have been so arrogant. ||4||<BR>
 If I had known that my robe would come loose, I would have tied a tighter knot.<BR>
 I have found none as great as You, Lord; I have looked and searched throughout the world. ||5||<BR>
 Fareed, if you have a keen understanding, then do not write black marks against anyone else.<BR>
 Look underneath your own collar instead. ||6||<BR>
 Fareed, do not turn around and strike those who strike you with their fists.<BR>
 Kiss their feet, and return to your own home. ||7||<BR>
 Fareed, when there was time for you to earn good karma, you were in love with the world instead.<BR>
 Now, death has a strong foothold; when the load is full, it is taken away. ||8||<BR>
 See, Fareed, what has happened: your beard has become grey.<BR>
 That which is coming is near, and the past is left far behind. ||9||<BR>
 See, Fareed, what has happened: sugar has become poison.<BR>
 Without my Lord, who can I tell of my sorrow? ||10||<BR>
 Fareed, my eyes have become weak, and my ears have become hard of hearing.<BR>
 The body's crop has become ripe and turned color. ||11||<BR>
 Fareed, those who did not enjoy their Spouse when their hair was black - hardly any of them enjoy Him when their hair turns grey.<BR>
 So be in love with the Lord, so that your color may ever be new. ||12||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 Fareed, whether one's hair is black or grey, our Lord and Master is always here if one remembers Him.<BR>
 This loving devotion to the Lord does not come by one's own efforts, even though all may long for it.<BR>
 This cup of loving devotion belongs to our Lord and Master; He gives it to whomever He likes. ||13||<BR>
 Fareed, those eyes which have enticed the world - I have seen those eyes.<BR>
 Once, they could not endure even a bit of mascara; now, the birds hatch their young in them! ||14||<BR>
 Fareed, they shouted and yelled, and constantly gave good advice.<BR>
 But those whom the devil has spoiled - how can they turn their consciousness towards God? ||15||<BR>
 Fareed, become the grass on the path,<BR>
 if you long for the Lord of all.<BR>
 One will cut you down, and another will trample you underfoot;<BR>
 then, you shall enter the Court of the Lord. ||16||<BR>
 Fareed, do not slander the dust; noting is as great as dust.<BR>
 When we are alive, it is under our feet, and when we are dead, it is above us. ||17||<BR>
 Fareed, when there is greed, what love can there be? When there is greed, love is false.<BR>
 How long can one remain in a thatched hut which leaks when it rains? ||18||<BR>
 Fareed, why do you wander from jungle to jungle, crashing through the thorny trees?<BR>
 The Lord abides in the heart; why are you looking for Him in the jungle? ||19||<BR>
 Fareed, with these small legs, I crossed deserts and mountains.<BR>
 But today, Fareed, my water jug seems hundreds of miles away. ||20||<BR>
 Fareed, the nights are long, and my sides are aching in pain.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 41 - Shaloks Of Shaykh Fareed Jee - Part 003</H2></CENTER>
 Cursed are the lives of those who place their hopes in others. ||21||<BR>
 Fareed, if I had been there when my friend came, I would have made myself a sacrifice to him.<BR>
 Now my flesh is burning red on the hot coals. ||22||<BR>
 Fareed, the farmer plants acacia trees, and wishes for grapes.<BR>
 He is spinning wool, but he wishes to wear silk. ||23||<BR>
 Fareed, the path is muddy, and the house of my Beloved is so far away.<BR>
 If I go out, my blanket will get soaked, but if I remain at home, then my heart will be broken. ||24||<BR>
 My blanket is soaked, drenched with the downpour of the Lord's Rain.<BR>
 I am going out to meet my Friend, so that my heart will not be broken. ||25||<BR>
 Fareed, I was worried that my turban might become dirty.<BR>
 My thoughtless self did not realize that one day, dust will consume my head as well. ||26||<BR>
 Fareed: sugar cane, candy, sugar, molasses, honey and buffalo's milk<BR>
 - all these things are sweet, but they are not equal to You. ||27||<BR>
 Fareed, my bread is made of wood, and hunger is my appetizer.<BR>
 Those who eat buttered bread, will suffer in terrible pain. ||28||<BR>
 Eat dry bread, and drink cold water.<BR>
 Fareed, if you see someone else's buttered bread, do not envy him for it. ||29||<BR>
 This night, I did not sleep with my Husband Lord, and now my body is suffering in pain.<BR>
 Go and ask the deserted bride, how she passes her night. ||30||<BR>
 She finds no place of rest in her father-in-law's home, and no place in her parents' home either.<BR>
 Her Husband Lord does not care for her; what sort of a blessed, happy soul-bride is she? ||31||<BR>
 In her father-in-law's home hereafter, and in her parents' home in this world, she belongs to her Husband Lord. Her Husband is Inaccessible and Unfathomable.<BR>
 O Nanak, she is the happy soul-bride, who is pleasing to her Carefree Lord. ||32||<BR>
 Bathing, washing and decorating herself, she comes and sleeps without anxiety.<BR>
 Fareed, she still smells like asafoetida; the fragrance of musk is gone. ||33||<BR>
 I am not afraid of losing my youth, as long as I do not lose the Love of my Husband Lord.<BR>
 Fareed, so many youths, without His Love, have dried up and withered away. ||34||<BR>
 Fareed, anxiety is my bed, pain is my mattress, and the pain of separation is my blanket and quilt.<BR>
 Behold, this is my life, O my True Lord and Master. ||35||<BR>
 Many talk of the pain and suffering of separation; O pain, you are the ruler of all.<BR>
 Fareed, that body, within which love of the Lord does not well up - look upon that body as a cremation ground. ||36||<BR>
 Fareed, these are poisonous sprouts coated with sugar.<BR>
 Some die planting them, and some are ruined, harvesting and enjoying them. ||37||<BR>
 Fareed, the hours of the day are lost wandering around, and the hours of the night are lost in sleep.<BR>
 God will call for your account, and ask you why you came into this world. ||38||<BR>
 Fareed, you have gone to the Lord's Door. Have you seen the gong there?<BR>
 This blameless object is being beaten - imagine what is in store for us sinners! ||39||<BR>
 Each and every hour, it is beaten; it is punished every day.<BR>
 This beautiful body is like the gong; it passes the night in pain. ||40||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 41 - Shaloks Of Shaykh Fareed Jee - Part 004</H2></CENTER>
 Shaykh Fareed has grown old, and his body has begun to tremble.<BR>
 Even if he could live for hundreds of years, his body will eventually turn to dust. ||41||<BR>
 Fareed begs, O Lord, do not make me sit at another's door.<BR>
 If this is the way you are going to keep me, then go ahead and take the life out of my body. ||42||<BR>
 With the axe on his shoulder, and a bucket on his head, the blacksmith is ready to cut down the tree.<BR>
 Fareed, I long for my Lord; you long only for the charcoal. ||43||<BR>
 Fareed, some have lots of flour, while others do not even have salt.<BR>
 When they go beyond this world, it shall be seen, who will be punished. ||44||<BR>
 Drums were beaten in their honor, there were canopies above their heads, and bugles announced their coming.<BR>
 They have gone to sleep in the cemetary, buried like poor orphans. ||45||<BR>
 Fareed, those who built houses, mansions and lofty buildings, are also gone.<BR>
 They made false deals, and were dropped into their graves. ||46||<BR>
 Fareed, there are many seams on the patched coat, but there are no seams on the soul.<BR>
 The shaykhs and their disciples have all departed, each in his own turn. ||47||<BR>
 Fareed, the two lamps are lit, but death has come anyway.<BR>
 It has captured the fortress of the body, and plundered the home of the heart; it extinguishes the lamps and departs. ||48||<BR>
 Fareed, look at what has happened to the cotton and the sesame seed,<BR>
 the sugar cane and paper, the clay pots and the charcoal.<BR>
 This is the punishment for those who do evil deeds. ||49||<BR>
 Fareed, you wear your prayer shawl on your shoulders and the robes of a Sufi; your words are sweet, but there is a dagger in your heart.<BR>
 Outwardly, you look bright, but your heart is dark as night. ||50||<BR>
 Fareed, not even a drop of blood would issue forth, if someone cut my body.<BR>
 Those bodies which are imbued with the Lord - those bodies contain no blood. ||51||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 This body is all blood; without blood, this body could not exist.<BR>
 Those who are imbued with their Lord, do not have the blood of greed in their bodies.<BR>
 When the Fear of God fills the body, it becomes thin; the blood of greed departs from within.<BR>
 Just as metal is purified by fire, the Fear of God removes the filthy residues of evil-mindedness.<BR>
 O Nanak, those humble beings are beautiful, who are imbued with the Lord's Love. ||52||<BR>
 Fareed, seek that sacred pool, in which the genuine article is found.<BR>
 Why do you bother to search in the pond? Your hand will only sink into the mud. ||53||<BR>
 Fareed, when she is young, she does not enjoy her Husband. When she grows up, she dies.<BR>
 Lying in the grave, the soul-bride cries, "I did not meet You, my Lord."||54||<BR>
 Fareed, your hair has turned grey, your beard has turned grey, and your moustache has turned grey.<BR>
 O my thoughtless and insane mind, why are you indulging in pleasures? ||55||<BR>
 Fareed, how long can you run on the rooftop? You are asleep to your Husband Lord - give it up!<BR>
 The days which were allotted to you are numbered, and they are passing, passing away. ||56||<BR>
 Fareed, houses, mansions and balconies - do not attach your consciousness to these.<BR>
 When these collapse into heaps of dust, none of them will be your friend. ||57||<BR>
 Fareed, do not focus on mansions and wealth; center your consciousness on death, your powerful enemy.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 41 - Shaloks Of Shaykh Fareed Jee - Part 005</H2></CENTER>
 Remember that place where you must go. ||58||<BR>
 Fareed, those deeds which do not bring merit - forget about those deeds.<BR>
 Otherwise, you shall be put to shame, in the Court of the Lord. ||59||<BR>
 Fareed, work for your Lord and Master; dispel the doubts of your heart.<BR>
 The dervishes, the humble devotees, have the patient endurance of trees. ||60||<BR>
 Fareed, my clothes are black, and my outfit is black.<BR>
 I wander around full of sins, and yet people call me a dervish - a holy man. ||61||<BR>
 The crop which is burnt will not bloom, even if it is soaked in water.<BR>
 Fareed, she who is forsaken by her Husband Lord, grieves and laments. ||62||<BR>
 When she is a virgin, she is full of desire; but when she is married, then her troubles begin.<BR>
 Fareed, she has this one regret, that she cannot be a virgin again. ||63||<BR>
 The swans have landed in a small pond of salt water.<BR>
 They dip in their bills, but do not drink; they fly away, still thirsty. ||64||<BR>
 The swans fly away, and land in the fields of grain. The people go to chase them away.<BR>
 The thoughtless people do not know, that the swans do not eat the grain. ||65||<BR>
 The birds which lived in the pools have flown away and left.<BR>
 Fareed, the overflowing pool shall also pass away, and only the lotus flowers shall remain. ||66||<BR>
 Fareed, a stone will be your pillow, and the earth will be your bed. The worms shall eat into your flesh.<BR>
 Countless ages will pass, and you will still be lying on one side. ||67||<BR>
 Fareed, your beautiful body shall break apart, and the subtle thread of the breath shall be snapped.<BR>
 In which house will the Messenger of Death be a guest today? ||68||<BR>
 Fareed, your beautiful body shall break apart, and the subtle thread of the breath shall be snapped.<BR>
 Those friends who were a burden on the earth - how can they come today? ||69||<BR>
 Fareed: O faithless dog, this is not a good way of life.<BR>
 You never come to the mosque for your five daily prayers. ||70||<BR>
 Rise up, Fareed, and cleanse yourself; chant your morning prayer.<BR>
 The head which does not bow to the Lord - chop off and remove that head. ||71||<BR>
 That head which does not bow to the Lord - what is to be done with that head?<BR>
 Put it in the fireplace, instead of firewood. ||72||<BR>
 Fareed, where are your mother and father, who gave birth to you?<BR>
 They have left you, but even so, you are not convinced that you shall also have to go. ||73||<BR>
 Fareed, flatten out your mind; smooth out the hills and valleys.<BR>
 Hereafter, the fires of hell shall not even approach you. ||74||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Fareed, the Creator is in the Creation, and the Creation abides in God.<BR>
 Whom can we call bad? There is none without Him. ||75||<BR>
 Fareed, if on that day when my umbilical cord was cut, my throat had been cut instead,<BR>
 I would not have fallen into so many troubles, or undergone so many hardships. ||76||<BR>
 My teeth, feet, eyes and ears have stopped working.<BR>
 My body cries out, "Those whom I knew have left me!"||77||<BR>
 Fareed, answer evil with goodness; do not fill your mind with anger.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 41 - Shaloks Of Shaykh Fareed Jee - Part 006</H2></CENTER>
 Your body shall not suffer from any disease, and you shall obtain everything. ||78||<BR>
 Fareed, the bird is a guest in this beautiful world-garden.<BR>
 The morning drums are beating - get ready to leave! ||79||<BR>
 Fareed, musk is released at night. Those who are sleeping do not receive their share.<BR>
 Those whose eyes are heavy with sleep - how can they receive it? ||80||<BR>
 Fareed, I thought that I was in trouble; the whole world is in trouble!<BR>
 When I climbed the hill and looked around, I saw this fire in each and every home. ||81||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Fareed, in the midst of this beautiful earth, there is a garden of thorns.<BR>
 Those humble beings who are blessed by their spiritual teacher, do not suffer even a scratch. ||82||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Fareed, life is blessed and beautiful, along with the beautiful body.<BR>
 Only a rare few are found, who love their Beloved Lord. ||83||<BR>
 O river, do not destroy your banks; you too will be asked to give your account.<BR>
 The river flows in whatever direction the Lord orders. ||84||<BR>
 Fareed, the day passes painfully; the night is spent in anguish.<BR>
 The boatman stands up and shouts, "The boat is caught in the whirlpool!"||85||<BR>
 The river flows on and on; it loves to eat into its banks.<BR>
 What can the whirlpool do to the boat, if the boatman remains alert? ||86||<BR>
 Fareed, there are dozens who say they are friends; I search, but I cannot find even one.<BR>
 I yearn for my beloved like a smouldering fire. ||87||<BR>
 Fareed, this body is always barking. Who can stand this constant suffering?<BR>
 I have put plugs in my ears; I don't care how much the wind is blowing. ||88||<BR>
 Fareed, God's dates have ripened, and rivers of honey flow.<BR>
 With each passing day, your life is being stolen away. ||89||<BR>
 Fareed, my withered body has become a skeleton; the crows are pecking at my palms.<BR>
 Even now, God has not come to help me; behold, this is the fate of all mortal beings. ||90||<BR>
 The crows have searched my skeleton, and eaten all my flesh.<BR>
 But please do not touch these eyes; I hope to see my Lord. ||91||<BR>
 O crow, do not peck at my skeleton; if you have landed on it, fly away.<BR>
 Do not eat the flesh from that skeleton, within which my Husband Lord abides. ||92||<BR>
 Fareed, the poor grave calls out, "O homeless one, come back to your home.<BR>
 You shall surely have to come to me; do not be afraid of death."||93||<BR>
 These eyes have seen a great many leave.<BR>
 Fareed, the people have their fate, and I have mine. ||94||<BR>
 God says, "If you reform yourself, you shall meet me, and meeting me, you shall be at peace.<BR>
 O Fareed, if you will be mine, the whole world will be yours."||95||<BR>
 How long can the tree remain implanted on the river-bank?<BR>
 Fareed, how long can water be kept in a soft clay pot? ||96||<BR>
 Fareed, the mansions are vacant; those who lived in them have gone to live underground.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 41 - Shaloks Of Shaykh Fareed Jee - Part 007</H2></CENTER>
 They remain there, in those unhonored graves.<BR>
 O Shaykh, dedicate yourself to God; you will have to depart, today or tomorrow. ||97||<BR>
 Fareed, the shore of death looks like the river-bank, being eroded away.<BR>
 Beyond is the burning hell, from which cries and shrieks are heard.<BR>
 Some understand this completely, while others wander around carelessly.<BR>
 Those actions which are done in this world, shall be examined in the Court of the Lord. ||98||<BR>
 Fareed, the crane perches on the river bank, playing joyfully.<BR>
 While it is playing, a hawk suddenly pounces on it.<BR>
 When the Hawk of God attacks, playful sport is forgotten.<BR>
 God does what is not expected or even considered. ||99||<BR>
 The body is nourished by water and grain.<BR>
 The mortal comes into the world with high hopes.<BR>
 But when the Messenger of Death comes, it breaks down all the doors.<BR>
 It binds and gags the mortal, before the eyes of his beloved brothers.<BR>
 Behold, the mortal being is going away, carried on the shoulders of four men.<BR>
 Fareed, only those good deeds done in the world will be of any use in the Court of the Lord. ||100||<BR>
 Fareed, I am a sacrifice to those birds which live in the jungle.<BR>
 They peck at the roots and live on the ground, but they do not leave the Lord's side. ||101||<BR>
 Fareed, the seasons change, the woods shake and the leaves drop from the trees.<BR>
 I have searched in the four directions, but I have not found any resting place anywhere. ||102||<BR>
 Fareed, I have torn my clothes to tatters; now I wear only a rough blanket.<BR>
 I wear only those clothes which will lead me to meet my Lord. ||103||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 Why do you tear apart your fine clothes, and take to wearing a rough blanket?<BR>
 O Nanak, even sitting in your own home, you can meet the Lord, if your mind is in the right place. ||104||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Fareed, those who are very proud of their greatness, wealth and youth,<BR>
 shall return empty-handed from their Lord, like sandhills after the rain. ||105||<BR>
 Fareed, the faces of those who forget the Lord's Name are dreadful.<BR>
 They suffer terrible pain here, and hereafter they find no place of rest or refuge. ||106||<BR>
 Fareed, if you do not awaken in the early hours before dawn, you are dead while yet alive.<BR>
 Although you have forgotten God, God has not forgotten you. ||107||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Fareed, my Husband Lord is full of joy; He is Great and Self-sufficient.<BR>
 To be imbued with the Lord God - this is the most beautiful decoration. ||108||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Fareed, look upon pleasure and pain as the same; eradicate corruption from your heart.<BR>
 Whatever pleases the Lord God is good; understand this, and you will reach His Court. ||109||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Fareed, the world dances as it dances, and you dance with it as well.<BR>
 That soul alone does not dance with it, who is under the care of the Lord God. ||110||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Fareed, the heart is imbued with this world, but the world is of no use to it at all.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 41 - Shaloks Of Shaykh Fareed Jee - Part 008</H2></CENTER>
 It is so difficult to be like the fakeers - the Holy Saints; it is only achieved by perfect karma. ||111||<BR>
 The first watch of the night brings flowers, and the later watches of the night bring fruit.<BR>
 Those who remain awake and aware, receive the gifts from the Lord. ||112||<BR>
 The gifts are from our Lord and Master; who can force Him to bestow them?<BR>
 Some are awake, and do not receive them, while He awakens others from sleep to bless them. ||113||<BR>
 You search for your Husband Lord; you must have some fault in your body.<BR>
 Those who are known as happy soul-brides, do not look to others. ||114||<BR>
 Within yourself, make patience the bow, and make patience the bowstring.<BR>
 Make patience the arrow, the Creator will not let you miss the target. ||115||<BR>
 Those who are patient abide in patience; in this way, they burn their bodies.<BR>
 They are close to the Lord, but they do not reveal their secret to anyone. ||116||<BR>
 Let patience be your purpose in life; implant this within your being.<BR>
 In this way, you will grow into a great river; you will not break off into a tiny stream. ||117||<BR>
 Fareed, it is difficult to be a dervish - a Holy Saint; it is easier to love bread when it is buttered.<BR>
 Only a rare few follow the way of the Saints. ||118||<BR>
 My body is cooking like an oven; my bones are burning like firewood.<BR>
 If my feet become tired, I will walk on my head, if I can meet my Beloved. ||119||<BR>
 Do not heat up your body like an oven, and do not burn your bones like firewood.<BR>
 What harm have your feet and head done to you? Behold your Beloved within yourself. ||120||<BR>
 I search for my Friend, but my Friend is already with me.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Unseen Lord cannot be seen; He is revealed only to the Gurmukh. ||121||<BR>
 Seeing the swans swimming, the cranes became excited.<BR>
 The poor cranes were drowned to death, with their heads below the water and their feet sticking out above. ||122||<BR>
 I knew him as a great swan, so I associated with him.<BR>
 If I had known that he was a only wretched crane, I would never in my life have crossed paths with him. ||123||<BR>
 Who is a swan, and who is a crane, if God blesses him with His Glance of Grace?<BR>
 If it pleases Him, O Nanak, He changes a crow into a swan. ||124||<BR>
 There is only one bird in the lake, but there are fifty trappers.<BR>
 This body is caught in the waves of desire. O my True Lord, You are my only hope! ||125||<BR>
 What is that word, what is that virtue, and what is that magic mantra?<BR>
 What are those clothes, which I can wear to captivate my Husband Lord? ||126||<BR>
 Humility is the word, forgiveness is the virtue, and sweet speech is the magic mantra.<BR>
 Wear these three robes, O sister, and you will captivate your Husband Lord. ||127||<BR>
 If you are wise, be simple;<BR>
 if you are powerful, be weak;<BR>
 and when there is nothing to share, then share with others.<BR>
 How rare is one who is known as such a devotee. ||128||<BR>
 Do not utter even a single harsh word; your True Lord and Master abides in all.<BR>
 Do not break anyone's heart; these are all priceless jewels. ||129||<BR>
 The minds of all are like precious jewels; to harm them is not good at all.<BR>
 If you desire your Beloved, then do not break anyone's heart. ||130||<BR>
