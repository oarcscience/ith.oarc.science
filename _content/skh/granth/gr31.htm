<HR><CENTER><H1>Shri Guru Granth Sahib: Raag Malaar</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 001</H2></CENTER>
 Raag Malaar, Chau-Padas, First Mehl, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<BR>
 Eating, drinking, laughing and sleeping, the mortal forgets about dying.<BR>
 Forgetting his Lord and Master, the mortal is ruined, and his life is cursed. He cannot remain forever. ||1||<BR>
 O mortal, meditate on the One Lord.<BR>
 You shall go to your true home with honor. ||1 Pause||<BR>
 Those who serve You - what can they give You? They beg for and receive what cannot remain.<BR>
 You are the Great Giver of all souls; You are the Life within all living beings. ||2||<BR>
 The Gurmukhs meditate, and receive the Ambrosial Nectar; thus they become pure.<BR>
 Day and night, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, O mortal. It makes the filthy immacuate. ||3||<BR>
 As is the season, so is the comfort of the body, and so is the body itself.<BR>
 O Nanak, that season is beautiful; without the Name, what season is it? ||4||1||<BR>
 Malaar, First Mehl:<BR>
 I offer prayers to my Beloved Guru, that He may unite me with my Husband Lord.<BR>
 I hear the thunder in the clouds, and my mind is cooled and soothed; imbued with the Love of my Dear Beloved, I sing His Glorious Praises. ||1||<BR>
 The rain pours down, and my mind is drenched with His Love.<BR>
 The drop of Ambrosial Nectar pleases my heart; the Guru has fascinated my mind, which is drenched in the sublime essence of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 With intuitive peace and poise, the soul-bride is loved by her Husband Lord; her mind is pleased and appeased by the Guru's Teachings.<BR>
 She is the happy soul-bride of her Husband Lord; her mind and body are filled with joy by His Love. ||2||<BR>
 Discarding her demerits, she becomes detached; with the Lord as her Husband, her marriage is eternal.<BR>
 She never suffers separation or sorrow; her Lord God showers her with His Grace. ||3||<BR>
 Her mind is steady and stable; she does not come and go in reincarnation.<BR>
 She takes the Shelter of the Perfect Guru. O Nanak, as Gurmukh, chant the Naam; you shall be accepted as the true soul-bride of the Lord. ||4||2||<BR>
 Malaar, First Mehl:<BR>
 They pretend to understand the Truth, but they are not satisfied by the Naam; they waste their lives in egotism.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 002</H2></CENTER>
 Caught in slander and attachment to the wealth and women of others, they eat poison and suffer in pain.<BR>
 They think about the Shabad, but they are not released from their fear and fraud; the minds and mouths are filled with Maya, Maya.<BR>
 Loading the heavy and crushing load, they die, only to be reborn, and waste their lives again. ||1||<BR>
 The Word of the Shabad is so very beautiful; it is pleasing to my mind.<BR>
 The mortal wanders lost in reincarnation, wearing various robes and clothes; when he is saved and protected by the Guru, then he finds the Truth. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He does not try to wash away his angry passions by bathing at sacred shrines. He does not love the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 He abandons and discards the priceless jewel, and he goes back from where he came.<BR>
 And so he becomes a maggot in manure, and in that, he is absorbed.<BR>
 The more he tastes, the more he is diseased; without the Guru, there is no peace and poise. ||2||<BR>
 Focusing my awareness on selfless service, I joyfully sing His Praises. As Gurmukh, I contemplate spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 The seeker comes forth, and the debater dies down; I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Guru, the Creator Lord.<BR>
 I am low and wretched, with shallow and false understanding; You embellish and exalt me through the Word of Your Shabad.<BR>
 And wherever there is self-realization, You are there; O True Lord Savior, You save us and carry us across. ||3||<BR>
 Where should I sit to chant Your Praises; which of Your Infinite Praises should I chant?<BR>
 The Unknown cannot be known; O Inaccessible, Unborn Lord God, You are the Lord and Master of masters.<BR>
 How can I compare You to anyone else I see? All are beggars - You are the Great Giver.<BR>
 Lacking devotion, Nanak looks to Your Door; please bless him with Your One Name, that he may enshrine it in his heart. ||4||3||<BR>
 Malaar, First Mehl:<BR>
 The soul-bride who has not known delight with her Husband Lord, shall weep and wail with a wretched face.<BR>
 She becomes hopeless, caught in the noose of her own karma; without the Guru, she wanders deluded by doubt. ||1||<BR>
 So rain down, O clouds. My Husband Lord has come home.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who has led me to meet my Lord God. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 My love, my Lord and Master is forever fresh; I am embellished with devotional worship night and day.<BR>
 I am liberated, gazing on the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan. Devotional worship has made me glorious and exalted throughout the ages. ||2||<BR>
 I am Yours; the three worlds are Yours as well. You are mine, and I am Yours.<BR>
 Meeting with the True Guru, I have found the Immaculate Lord; I shall not be consigned to this terrifying world-ocean ever again. ||3||<BR>
 If the soul-bride is filled with delight on seeing her Husband Lord, then her decorations are true.<BR>
 With the Immaculate Celestial Lord, she becomes the truest of the true. Following the Guru's Teachings, she leans on the Support of the Naam. ||4||<BR>
 She is liberated; the Guru has untied her bonds. Focusing her awareness on the Shabad, she attains honor.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Lord's Name is deep within her heart; as Gurmukh, she is united in His Union. ||5||4||<BR>
 First Mehl, Malaar:<BR>
 Others' wives, others' wealth, greed, egotism, corruption and poison;<BR>
 evil passions, slander of others, sexual desire and anger - give up all these. ||1||<BR>
 The Inaccessible, Infinite Lord is sitting in His Mansion.<BR>
 That humble being, whose conduct is in harmony with the jewel of the Guru's Shabad, obtains the Ambrosial Nectar. ||1||Pause||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 003</H2></CENTER>
 He sees pleasure and pain as both the same, along with good and bad in the world.<BR>
 Wisdom, understanding and awareness are found in the Name of the Lord. In the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, embrace love for the Guru. ||2||<BR>
 Day and night, profit is obtained through the Lord's Name. The Guru, the Giver, has given this gift.<BR>
 That Sikh who becomes Gurmukh obtains it. The Creator blesses him with His Glance of Grace. ||3||<BR>
 The body is a mansion, a temple, the home of the Lord; He has infused His Infinite Light into it.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh is invited to the Mansion of the Lord's Presence; the Lord unites him in His Union. ||4||5||<BR>
 Malaar, First Mehl, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Know that the creation was formed through air and water;<BR>
 have no doubt that the body was made through fire.<BR>
 And if you know where the soul comes from,<BR>
 you shall be known as a wise religious scholar. ||1||<BR>
 Who can know the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, O mother?<BR>
 Without seeing Him, we cannot say anything about Him.<BR>
 How can anyone speak and describe Him, O mother? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He is high above the sky, and beneath the nether worlds.<BR>
 How can I speak of Him? Let me understand.<BR>
 Who knows what sort of Name is chanted, in the heart, without the tongue? ||2||<BR>
 Undoubtedly, words fail me.<BR>
 He alone understands, who is blessed.<BR>
 Day and night, deep within, he remains lovingly attuned to the Lord.<BR>
 He is the true person, who is merged in the True Lord. ||3||<BR>
 If someone of high social standing becomes a selfless servant,<BR>
 then his praises cannot even be expressed.<BR>
 And if someone from a low social class becomes a selfless servant,<BR>
 O Nanak, he shall wear shoes of honor. ||4||1||6||<BR>
 Malaar, First Mehl:<BR>
 The pain of separation - this is the hungry pain I feel.<BR>
 Another pain is the attack of the Messenger of Death.<BR>
 Another pain is the disease consuming my body.<BR>
 O foolish doctor, don't give me medicine. ||1||<BR>
 O foolish doctor, don't give me medicine.<BR>
 The pain persists, and the body continues to suffer.<BR>
 Your medicine has no effect on me. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Forgetting his Lord and Master, the mortal enjoys sensual pleasures;<BR>
 then, disease rises up in his body.<BR>
 The blind mortal receives his punishment.<BR>
 O foolish doctor, don't give me medicine. ||2||<BR>
 The value of sandalwood lies in its fragrance.<BR>
 The value of the human lasts only as long as the breath in the body.<BR>
 When the breath is taken away, the body crumbles into dust.<BR>
 After that, no one takes any food. ||3||<BR>
 The mortal's body is golden, and the soul-swan is immaculate and pure,<BR>
 if even a tiny particle of the Immaculate Naam is within.<BR>
 All pain and disease are eradicated.<BR>
 O Nanak, the mortal is saved through the True Name. ||4||2||7||<BR>
 Malaar, First Mehl:<BR>
 Pain is the poison. The Lord's Name is the antidote.<BR>
 Grind it up in the mortar of contentment, with the pestle of charitable giving.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 004</H2></CENTER>
 Take it each and every day, and your body shall not waste away.<BR>
 At the very last instant, you shall strike down the Messenger of Death. ||1||<BR>
 So take such medicine, O fool,<BR>
 by which your corruption shall be taken away. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Power, wealth and youth are all just shadows,<BR>
 as are the vehicles you see moving around.<BR>
 Neither your body, nor your fame, nor your social status shall go along with you.<BR>
 In the next world it is day, while here, it is all night. ||2||<BR>
 Let your taste for pleasures be the firewood, let your greed be the ghee,<BR>
 and your sexual desire and anger the cooking oil; burn them in the fire.<BR>
 Some make burnt offerings, hold sacred feasts, and read the Puraanas.<BR>
 Whatever pleases God is acceptable. ||3||<BR>
 Intense meditation is the paper, and Your Name is the insignia.<BR>
 Those for whom this treasure is ordered,<BR>
 look wealthy when they reach their true home.<BR>
 O Nanak, blessed is that mother who gave birth to them. ||4||3||8||<BR>
 Malaar, First Mehl:<BR>
 You wear white clothes, and speak sweet words.<BR>
 Your nose is sharp, and your eyes are black.<BR>
 Have you ever seen your Lord and Master, O sister? ||1||<BR>
 O my All-powerful Lord and Master, by Your power, I fly and soar, and ascend to the heavens.<BR>
 I see Him in the water, on the land, in the mountains, on the river-banks,<BR>
 in all places and interspaces, O brother. ||2||<BR>
 He fashioned the body, and gave it wings;<BR>
 He gave it great thirst and desire to fly.<BR>
 When He bestows His Glance of Grace, I am comforted and consoled.<BR>
 As He makes me see, so do I see, O brother. ||3||<BR>
 Neither this body, nor its wings, shall go to the world hereafter.<BR>
 It is a fusion of air, water and fire.<BR>
 O Nanak, if it is in the mortal's karma, then he meditates on the Lord, with the Guru as his Spiritual Teacher.<BR>
 This body is absorbed in the Truth. ||4||4||9||<BR>
 Malaar, Third Mehl, Chau-Padas, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The Formless Lord is formed by Himself. He Himself deludes in doubt.<BR>
 Creating the Creation, the Creator Himself beholds it; He enjoins us as He pleases.<BR>
 This is the true greatness of His servant, that he obeys the Hukam of the Lord's Command. ||1||<BR>
 Only He Himself knows His Will. By Guru's Grace, it is grasped.<BR>
 When this play of Shiva and Shakti comes to his home, he remains dead while yet alive. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 They read the Vedas, and read them again, and engage in arguments about Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.<BR>
 This three-phased Maya has deluded the whole world into cynicism about death and birth.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, know the One Lord, and the anxiety of your mind will be allayed. ||2||<BR>
 I am meek, foolish and thoughtless, but still, You take care of me.<BR>
 Please be kind to me, and make me the slave of Your slaves, so that I may serve You.<BR>
 Please bless me with the treasure of the One Name, that I may chant it, day and night. ||3||<BR>
 Says Nanak, by Guru's Grace, understand. Hardly anyone considers this.<BR>
 Like foam bubbling up on the surface of the water, so is this world.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 005</H2></CENTER>
 It shall eventually merge back into that from which it came, and all its expanse shall be gone. ||4||1||<BR>
 Malaar, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Those who realize the Hukam of the Lord's Command are united with Him; through the Word of His Shabad, their egotism is burnt away.<BR>
 They perform true devotional worship day and night; they remain lovingly attuned to the True Lord.<BR>
 They gaze on their True Lord forever, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, with loving ease. ||1||<BR>
 O mortal, accept His Will and find peace.<BR>
 God is pleased by the Pleasure of His Own Will. Whomever He forgives, meets no obstacles on the way. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Under the influence of the three gunas, the three dispositions, the mind wanders everywhere, without love or devotion to the Lord.<BR>
 No one is ever saved or liberated, by doing deeds in ego.<BR>
 Whatever our Lord and Master wills, comes to pass. People wander according to their past actions. ||2||<BR>
 Meeting with the True Guru, the mind is overpowered; the Lord's Name comes to abide in the mind.<BR>
 The value of such a person cannot be estimated; nothing at all can be said about him.<BR>
 He comes to dwell in the fourth state; he remains merged in the True Lord. ||3||<BR>
 My Lord God is Inaccessible and Unfathomable. His value cannot be expressed.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, he comes to understand, and live the Shabad.<BR>
 O Nanak, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord. ||4||2||<BR>
 Malaar, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Rare is that person who, as Gurmukh, understands; the Lord has bestowed His Glance of Grace.<BR>
 There is no Giver except the Guru. He grants His Grace and forgives.<BR>
 Meeting the Guru, peace and tranquility well up; chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, day and night. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, meditate on the Ambrosial Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Meeting with the True Guru and the Primal Being, the Name is obtained, and one remains forever absorbed in the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs are forever separated from the Lord; no one is with them.<BR>
 They are stricken with the great disease of egotism; they are hit on the head by the Messenger of Death.<BR>
 Those who follow the Guru's Teachings are never separated from the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. They dwell on the Naam, night and day. ||2||<BR>
 You are the One and Only Creator of all. You continually create, watch over and contemplate.<BR>
 Some are Gurmukh - You unite them with Yourself. You bless then with the treasure of devotion.<BR>
 You Yourself know everything. Unto whom should I complain? ||3||<BR>
 The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is Ambrosial Nectar. By the Lord's Grace, it is obtained.<BR>
 Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, night and day, the intuitive peace and poise of the Guru is obtained.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Naam is the greatest treasure. Focus your consciousness on the Naam. ||4||3||<BR>
 Malaar, Third Mehl:<BR>
 I praise the Guru, the Giver of peace, forever. He truly is the Lord God.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, I have obtained the supreme status. His glorious greatness is glorious!<BR>
 One who sings the Glorious Praises of the True Lord, merges in the True Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O mortal, contemplate the Guru's Word in your heart.<BR>
 Abandon your false family, poisonous egotism and desire; remember in your heart, that you will have to leave. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The True Guru is the Giver of the Lord's Name. There is no other giver at all.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 006</H2></CENTER>
 Bestowing the gift of the soul, He satisfies the mortal beings, and merges them in the True Name.<BR>
 Night and day, they ravish and enjoy the Lord within the heart; they are intuitively absorbed in Samaadhi. ||2||<BR>
 The Shabad, the Word of the True Guru, has pierced my mind. The True Word of His Bani permeates my heart.<BR>
 My God is Unseen; He cannot be seen. The Gurmukh speaks the Unspoken.<BR>
 When the Giver of peace grants His Grace, the mortal being meditates on the Lord, the Life of the Universe. ||3||<BR>
 He does not come and go in renicarnation any longer; the Gurmukh meditates intuitively.<BR>
 From the mind, the mind merges into our Lord and Master; the mind is absorbed into the Mind.<BR>
 In truth, the True Lord is pleased with truth; eradicate egotism from within yourself. ||4||<BR>
 Our One and Only Lord and Master dwells within the mind; there is no other at all.<BR>
 The One Name is Sweet Ambrosial Nectar; it is Immaculate Truth in the world.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Name of God is obtained, by those who are so predestined. ||5||4||<BR>
 Malaar, Third Mehl:<BR>
 All the heavenly heralds and celestial singers are saved through the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 They contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Subduing their ego, the Name abides in their minds; they keep the Lord enshrined in their hearts.<BR>
 He alone understands, whom the Lord causes to understand; the Lord unites him with Himself.<BR>
 Night and day, he sings the Word of the Shabad and the Guru's Bani; he remains lovingly attuned to the True Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, each and every moment, dwell on the Naam.<BR>
 The Shabad is the Guru's Gift. It shall bring you lasting peace deep within; it shall always stand by you. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs never give up their hypocrisy; in the love of duality, they suffer in pain.<BR>
 Forgetting the Naam, their minds are imbued with corruption. They waste away their lives uselessly.<BR>
 This opportunity shall not come into their hands again; night and day, they shall always regret and repent.<BR>
 They die and die again and again, only to be reborn, but they never understand. They rot away in manure. ||2||<BR>
 The Gurmukhs are imbued with the Naam, and are saved; they contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 Meditating on the Name of the Lord, they are Jivan-mukta, liberated while yet alive. They enshrine the Lord within their hearts.<BR>
 Their minds and bodies are immaculate, their intellect is immaculate and sublime. Their speech is sublime as well.<BR>
 They realize the One Primal Being, the One Lord God. There is no other at all. ||3||<BR>
 God Himself is the Doer, and He Himself is the Cause of causes. He Himself bestows His Glance of Grace.<BR>
 My mind and body are imbued with the Word of the Guru's Bani. My consciousness is immersed in His service.<BR>
 The Unseen and Inscrutable Lord dwells deep within. He is seen only by the Gurmukh.<BR>
 O Nanak, He gives to whomever He pleases. According to the Pleasure of His Will, He leads the mortals on. ||4||5||<BR>
 Malaar, Third Mehl, Du-Tukas:<BR>
 Through the True Guru, the mortal obtains the special place, the Mansion of the Lord's Presence in his own home.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, his egotistical pride is dispelled. ||1||<BR>
 Those who have the Naam inscribed on their foreheads,<BR>
 meditate on the Naam night and day, forever and ever. They are honored in the True Court of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 From the True Guru, they learn the ways and means of the mind. Night and day, they focus their meditation on the Lord forever.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 007</H2></CENTER>
 Imbued with the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they remain forever detached. They are honored in the True Court of the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 This mind plays, subject to the Lord's Will; in an instant, it wanders out in the ten directions and returns home again.<BR>
 When the True Lord God Himself bestows His Glance of Grace, then this mind is instantly brought under control by the Gurmukh. ||3||<BR>
 The mortal comes to know the ways and means of the mind, realizing and contemplating the Shabad.<BR>
 O Nanak, meditate forever on the Naam, and cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||4||6||<BR>
 Malaar, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Soul, body and breath of life are all His; He is permeating and pervading each and every heart.<BR>
 Except the One Lord, I do not know any other at all. The True Guru has revealed this to me. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, remain lovingly attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I meditate on the Lord, the Unseen, Unfathomable and Infinite Creator. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Mind and body are pleased, lovingly attuned to the One Lord, intuitively absorbed in peace and poise.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, doubt and fear are dispelled, being lovingly attuned to the One Name. ||2||<BR>
 When the mortal follows the Guru's Teachings, and lives the Truth, then he attains the state of emancipation.<BR>
 Among millions, how rare is that one who understands, and is lovingly attuned to the Name of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 Wherever I look, there I see the One. This understanding has come through the Guru's Teachings.<BR>
 I place my mind, body and breath of life in offering before Him; O Nanak, self-conceit is gone. ||4||7||<BR>
 Malaar, Third Mehl:<BR>
 My True Lord God, the Eradicator of suffering, is found through the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 Imbued with devotional worship, the mortal remains forever detached. He is honored in the True Court of the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O mind, remain absorbed in the Mind.<BR>
 The mind of the Gurmukh is pleased with the Lord's Name, lovingly attuned to the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 My God is totally Inaccessible and Unfathomable; through the Guru's Teachings, He is understood.<BR>
 True self-discipline rests in singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, lovingly attuned to the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 He Himself is the Shabad, and He Himself is the True Teachings; He merges our light into the Light.<BR>
 The breath vibrates through this frail body; the Gurmukh obtains the ambrosial nectar. ||3||<BR>
 He Himself fashions, and He Himself links us to our tasks; the True Lord is pervading everywhere.<BR>
 O Nanak, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, no one is anything. Through the Naam,we are blessed with glory. ||4||8||<BR>
 Malaar, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The mortal is enticed by the poison of corruption, burdened with such a heavy load.<BR>
 The Lord has placed the magic spell of the Shabad into his mouth, and destroyed the poison of ego. ||1||<BR>
 O mortal, egotism and attachment are such heavy loads of pain.<BR>
 This terrifying world-ocean cannot be crossed; through the Lord's Name, the Gurmukh crosses over to the other side. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Attachment to the three-phased show of Maya pervades all the created forms.<BR>
 In the Sat Sangat, the Society of the Saints, the state of supreme awareness is attained. The Merciful Lord carries us across. ||2||<BR>
 The smell of sandalwood is so sublime; its fragrance spreads out far and wide.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 008</H2></CENTER>
 The lifestyle of the Lord's humble servant is exalted and sublime. He spreads the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises throughout the world. ||3||<BR>
 O my Lord and Master, please be merciful, merciful to me, that I may enshrine the Lord, Har, Har, Har, within my heart.<BR>
 Nanak has found the Perfect True Guru; in his mind, he chants the Name of the Lord. ||4||9||<BR>
 Malaar, Third Mehl, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Is this mind a householder, or is this mind a detached renunciate?<BR>
 Is this mind beyond social class, eternal and unchanging?<BR>
 Is this mind fickle, or is this mind detached?<BR>
 How has this mind been gripped by possessiveness? ||1||<BR>
 O Pandit, O religious scholar, reflect on this in your mind.<BR>
 Why do you read so many other things, and carry such a heavy load? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Creator has attached it to Maya and possessiveness.<BR>
 Enforcing His Order, He created the world.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, understand this, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 Remain forever in the Sanctuary of the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 He alone is a Pandit, who sheds the load of the three qualities.<BR>
 Night and day, he chants the Name of the One Lord.<BR>
 He accepts the Teachings of the True Guru.<BR>
 He offers his head to the True Guru.<BR>
 He remains forever unattached in the state of Nirvaanaa.<BR>
 Such a Pandit is accepted in the Court of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 He preaches that the One Lord is within all beings.<BR>
 As he sees the One Lord, he knows the One Lord.<BR>
 That person, whom the Lord forgives, is united with Him.<BR>
 He finds eternal peace, here and hereafter. ||4||<BR>
 Says Nanak, what can anyone do?<BR>
 He alone is liberated, whom the Lord blesses with His Grace.<BR>
 Night and day, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<BR>
 Then, he no longer bothers with the proclamations of the Shaastras or the Vedas. ||5||1||10||<BR>
 Malaar, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs wander lost in reincarnation, confused and deluded by doubt.<BR>
 The Messenger of Death constantly beats them and disgraces them.<BR>
 Serving the True Guru, the mortal's subservience to Death is ended.<BR>
 He meets the Lord God, and enters the Mansion of His Presence. ||1||<BR>
 O mortal, as Gurmukh, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 In duality, you are ruining and wasting this priceless human life. You trade it away in exchange for a shell. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Gurmukh falls in love with the Lord, by His Grace.<BR>
 He enshrines loving devotion to the Lord, Har, Har, deep within his heart.<BR>
 The Word of the Shabad carries him across the terrifying world-ocean.<BR>
 He appears true in the True Court of the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Performing all sorts of rituals, they do not find the True Guru.<BR>
 Without the Guru, so many wander lost and confused in Maya.<BR>
 Egotism, possessiveness and attachment rise up and increase within them.<BR>
 In the love of dualty, the self-willed manmukhs suffer in pain. ||3||<BR>
 The Creator Himself is Inaccessible and Infinite.<BR>
 Chant the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and earn the true profit.<BR>
 The Lord is Independent, Ever-present, here and now.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 009</H2></CENTER>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh merges in the Naam. ||4||2||11||<BR>
 Malaar, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Those who are attached to the Guru's Teachings, are Jivan-mukta, liberated while yet alive.<BR>
 They remain forever awake and aware night and day, in devotional worship of the Lord.<BR>
 They serve the True Guru, and eradicate their self-conceit.<BR>
 I fall at the feet of such humble beings. ||1||<BR>
 Constantly singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, I live.<BR>
 The Word of the Guru's Shabad is such totally sweet elixir. Through the Name of the Lord, I have attained the state of liberation. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Attachment to Maya leads to the darkness of ignorance.<BR>
 The self-willed manukhs are attached, foolish and ignorant.<BR>
 Night and day, their lives pass away in worldly entanglements.<BR>
 They die and die again and again, only to be reborn and receive their punishment. ||2||<BR>
 The Gurmukh is lovingly attuned to the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 He does not cling to false greed.<BR>
 Whatever he does, he does with intuitive poise.<BR>
 He drinks in the sublime essence of the Lord; his tongue delights in its flavor. ||3||<BR>
 Among millions, hardly any understand.<BR>
 The Lord Himself forgives, and bestows His glorious greatness.<BR>
 Whoever meets with the Primal Lord God, shall never be separated again.<BR>
 Nanak is absorbed in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||4||3||12||<BR>
 Malaar, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Everyone speaks the Name of the Lord with the tongue.<BR>
 But only by serving the True Guru does the mortal receive the Name.<BR>
 His bonds are shattered, and he stays in the house of liberation.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he sits in the eternal, unchanging house. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, why are you angry?<BR>
 In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Lord's Name is the source of profit. Contemplate and appreciate the Guru's Teachings within your heart, night and day. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Each and every instant, the rainbird cries and calls.<BR>
 Without seeing her Beloved, she does not sleep at all.<BR>
 She cannot endure this separation.<BR>
 When she meets the True Guru, then she intuitively meets her Beloved. ||2||<BR>
 Lacking the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the mortal suffers and dies.<BR>
 He is burnt in the fire of desire, and his hunger does not depart.<BR>
 Without good destiny, he cannot find the Naam.<BR>
 He performs all sorts of rituals until he is exhausted. ||3||<BR>
 The mortal thinks about the Vedic teachings of the three gunas, the three dispositions.<BR>
 He deals in corruption, filth and vice.<BR>
 He dies, only to be reborn; he is ruined over and over again.<BR>
 The Gurmukh enshrines the glory of the supreme state of celestial peace. ||4||<BR>
 One who has faith in the Guru - everyone has faith in him.<BR>
 Through the Guru's Word, the mind is cooled and soothed.<BR>
 Throughout the four ages, that humble being is known to be pure.<BR>
 O Nanak, that Gurmukh is so rare. ||5||4||13||9||13||22||<BR>
 Raag Malaar, Fourth Mehl, First House, Chau-Padas:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Night and day, I meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, within my heart; through the Guru's Teachings, my pain is forgotten.<BR>
 The chains of all my hopes and desires have been snapped; my Lord God has showered me with His Mercy. ||1||<BR>
 My eyes gaze eternally on the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 Gazing on the True Guru, my mind blossoms forth. I have met with the Lord, the Lord of the World. ||1||Pause||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 010</H2></CENTER>
 One who forgets such a Name of the Lord, Har, Har - his family is dishonored.<BR>
 His family is sterile and barren, and his mother is made a widow. ||2||<BR>
 O Lord, let me meet the Holy Guru, who night and day keep the Lord enshrined in his heart.<BR>
 Seeing the Guru, the GurSikh blossoms forth, like the child seeing his mother. ||3||<BR>
 The soul-bride and the Husband Lord live together as one, but the hard wall of egotism has come between them.<BR>
 The Perfect Guru demolishes the wall of egotism; servant Nanak has met the Lord, the Lord of the World. ||4||1||<BR>
 Malaar, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 The Ganges, the Jamunaa, the Godaavari and the Saraswati - these rivers strive for the dust of the feet of the Holy.<BR>
 Overflowing with their filthy sins, the mortals take cleansing baths in them; the rivers' pollution is washed away by the dust of the feet of the Holy. ||1||<BR>
 Instead of bathing at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, take your cleansing bath in the Name.<BR>
 When the dust of the feet of the Sat Sangat rises up into the eyes, all filthy evil-mindedness is removed. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Bhaageerat'h the penitent brought the Ganges down, and Shiva established Kaydaar.<BR>
 Krishna grazed cows in Kaashi; through the humble servant of the Lord, these places became famous. ||2||<BR>
 And all the sacred shrines of pilgrimage established by the gods, long for the dust of the feet of the Holy.<BR>
 Meeting with the Lord's Saint, the Holy Guru, I apply the dust of His feet to my face. ||3||<BR>
 And all the creatures of Your Universe, O my Lord and Master, long for the dust of the feet of the Holy.<BR>
 O Nanak, one who has such destiny inscribed on his forehead, is blessed with the dust of the feet of the Holy; the Lord carries him across. ||4||2||<BR>
 Malaar, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 The Lord seems sweet to that humble being who is blessed by the Grace of the Lord.<BR>
 His hunger and pain are totally taken away; he chants the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||<BR>
 Meditating on the Lord, Har, Har, Har, the mortal is emancipated.<BR>
 One who listens to the Guru's Teachings and meditates on them, is carried across the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I am the slave of that humble being, who is blessed by the Grace of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 Meeting with the Lord's humble servant, peace is obtained; all the pollution and filth of evil-mindedness is washed away. ||2||<BR>
 The humble servant of the Lord feels hunger only for the Lord. He is satisfied only when he chants the Lord's Glories.<BR>
 The humble servant of the Lord is a fish in the Water of the Lord. Forgetting the Lord, he would dry up and die. ||3||<BR>
 He alone knows this love, who enshrines it within his mind.<BR>
 Servant Nanak gazes upon the Lord and is at peace; The hunger of his body is totally satisfied. ||4||3||<BR>
 Malaar, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 All the beings and creatures which God has created - on their foreheds, He has written their destiny.<BR>
 The Lord blesses His humble servant with glorious greatness. The Lord enjoins him to his tasks. ||1||<BR>
 The True Guru implants the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, within.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 011</H2></CENTER>
 Chant the Name of the Lord, O Sikhs of the Guru, O my Siblings of Destiny. Only the Lord will carry you across the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 That humble being who worships, adores and serves the Guru is pleasing to my Lord God.<BR>
 To worship and adore the True Guru is to serve the Lord. In His Mercy, He saves us and carries us across. ||2||<BR>
 The ignorant and the blind wander deluded by doubt; deluded and confused, they pick flowers to offer to their idols.<BR>
 They worship lifeless stones and serve the tombs of the dead; all their efforts are useless. ||3||<BR>
 He alone is said to be the True Guru, who realizes God, and proclaims the Sermon of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 Offer the Guru sacred foods, clothes, silk and satin robes of all sorts; know that He is True. The merits of this shall never leave you lacking. ||4||<BR>
 The Divine True Guru is the Embodiment, the Image of the Lord; He utters the Ambrosial Word.<BR>
 O Nanak, blessed and good is the destiny of that humble being, who focuses his consciousness on the Feet of the Lord. ||5||4||<BR>
 Malaar, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 Those whose hearts are filled with my True Guru - those Saints are good and noble in every way.<BR>
 Seeing them, my mind blossoms forth in bliss; I am forever a sacrifice to them. ||1||<BR>
 O spiritual teacher, chant the Name of the Lord, day and night.<BR>
 All hunger and thirst are satisfied, for those who partake of the sublime essence of the Lord, through the Guru's Teachings. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The slaves of the Lord are our Holy companions. Meeting with them, doubt is taken away.<BR>
 As the swan separates the milk from the water, the Holy Saint removes the fire of egotism from the body. ||2||<BR>
 Those who do not love the Lord in their hearts are deceitful; they continually practice deception.<BR>
 What can anyone give them to eat? Whatever they themselves plant, they must eat. ||3||<BR>
 This is the Quality of the Lord, and of the Lord's humble servants as well; the Lord places His Own Essence within them.<BR>
 Blessed, blessed, is Guru Nanak, who looks impartially on all; He crosses over and transcends both slander and praise. ||4||5||<BR>
 Malaar, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 The Name of the Lord is inaccessible, unfathomable, exalted and sublime. It is chanted by the Lord's Grace.<BR>
 By great good fortune, I have found the True Congregation, and in the Company of the Holy, I am carried across. ||1||<BR>
 My mind is in ecstasy, night and day.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, I chant the Name of the Lord. Doubt and fear are gone from my mind. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Those who chant and meditate on the Lord - O Lord, in Your Mercy, please unite me with them.<BR>
 Gazing upon them, I am at peace; the pain and disease of egotism are gone. ||2||<BR>
 Those who meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord in their hearts - their lives become totally fruitful.<BR>
 They themselves swim across, and carry the world across with them. Their ancestors and family cross over as well. ||3||<BR>
 You Yourself created the whole world, and You Yourself keep it under Your control.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 012</H2></CENTER>
 God has showered His Mercy on servant Nanak; He has lifted him up, and rescued him from the ocean of poison. ||4||6||<BR>
 Malaar, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 Those who do not drink in the Ambrosial Nectar by Guru's Grace - their thirst and hunger are not relieved.<BR>
 The foolish self-willed manmukh burns in the fire of egotistical pride; he suffers painfully in egotism.<BR>
 Coming and going, he wastes his life uselessly; afflicted with pain, he regrets and repents.<BR>
 He does not even think of the One, from whom he originated. Cursed is his life, and cursed is his food. ||1||<BR>
 O mortal, as Gurmukh, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 The Lord, Har, Har, in His Mercy leads the mortal to meet the Guru; he is absorbed in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The life of the self-willed manmukh is useless; he comes and goes in shame.<BR>
 In sexual desire and anger, the proud ones are drowned. They are burnt in their egotism.<BR>
 They do not attain perfection or understanding; their intellect is dimmed. Tossed by the waves of greed, they suffer in pain.<BR>
 Without the Guru, they suffer in terrible pain. Seized by Death, they weep and wail. ||2||<BR>
 As Gurmukh, I have attained the Unfathomable Name of the Lord, with intuitive peace and poise.<BR>
 The treasure of the Naam abides deep within my heart. My tongue sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<BR>
 I am forever in bliss, day and night, lovingly attuned to the One Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 I have obtained the treasure of the Naam with intuitive ease; this is the glorious greatness of the True Guru. ||3||<BR>
 Through the True Guru, the Lord, Har, Har, comes to dwell within my mind. I am forever a sacrifice to the True Guru.<BR>
 I have dedicated my mind and body to Him, and placed everything before Him in offering. I focus my consciousness on His Feet.<BR>
 Please be merciful to me, O my Perfect Guru, and unite me with Yourself.<BR>
 I am just iron; the Guru is the boat, to carry me across. ||4||7||<BR>
 Malaar, Fourth Mehl, Partaal, Third House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The humble servant of the Lord chants the Name of the Supreme Lord; he joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Lord's Holy. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Deal only in the wealth of the Lord, and gather only the wealth of the Lord. No thief can ever steal it. ||1||<BR>
 The rainbirds and the peacocks sing day and night, hearing the thunder in the clouds. ||2||<BR>
 Whatever the deer, the fish and the birds sing, they chant to the Lord, and no other. ||3||<BR>
 Servant Nanak sings the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises; the sound and fury of Death has totally gone away. ||4||1||8||<BR>
 Malaar, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 They speak and chant the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam; the very fortunate ones seek Him.<BR>
 Whoever shows me the Way of the Lord - I fall at his feet. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Lord is my Friend and Compansion; I am in love with the Lord.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 013</H2></CENTER>
 I sing of the Lord, and I speak of the Lord; I have discarded all other loves. ||1||<BR>
 My Beloved is the Enticer of the mind; The Detached Lord God is the Embodiment of Supreme bliss.<BR>
 Nanak lives by gazing upon the Lord; may I see Him for a moment, for even just an instant. ||2||2||9||9||13||9||31||<BR>
 Raag Malaar, Fifth Mehl, Chau-Padas, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 What are you so worried about? What are you thinking? What have you tried?<BR>
 Tell me - the Lord of the Universe - who controls Him? ||1||<BR>
 The rain showers down from the clouds, O companion. The Guest has come into my home.<BR>
 I am meek; my Lord and Master is the Ocean of Mercy. I am absorbed in the nine treasures of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I have prepared all sorts of foods in various ways, and all sorts of sweet deserts.<BR>
 I have made my kitchen pure and sacred. Now, O my Sovereign Lord King, please sample my food. ||2||<BR>
 The villains have been destroyed, and my friends are delighted. This is Your Own Mansion and Temple, O Lord.<BR>
 When my Playful Beloved came into my household, then I found total peace. ||3||<BR>
 In the Society of the Saints, I have the Support and Protection of the Perfect Guru; this is the pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon my forehead.<BR>
 Servant Nanak has found his Playful Husband Lord. He shall never suffer in sorrow again. ||4||1||<BR>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 When the baby's only food is milk, it cannot survive without its milk.<BR>
 The mother takes care of it, and pours milk into its mouth; then, it is satisfied and fulfilled. ||1||<BR>
 I am just a baby; God, the Great Giver, is my Father.<BR>
 The child is so foolish; it makes so many mistakes. But it has nowhere else to go. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The mind of the poor child is fickle; he touches even snakes and fire.<BR>
 His mother and father hug him close in their embrace, and so he plays in joy and bliss. ||2||<BR>
 What hunger can the child ever have, O my Lord and Master, when You are his Father?<BR>
 The treasure of the Naam and the nine treasures are in Your celestial household. You fulfill the desires of the mind. ||3||<BR>
 My Merciful Father has issued this Command: whatever the child asks for, is put into his mouth.<BR>
 Nanak, the child, longs for the Blessed Vision of God's Darshan. May His Feet always dwell within my heart. ||4||2||<BR>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I tried everything, and gathered all devices together; I have discarded all my anxieties.<BR>
 I have begun to set all my household affairs right; I have placed my faith in my Lord and Master. ||1||<BR>
 I listen to the celestial vibrations resonating and resounding.<BR>
 Sunrise has come, and I gaze upon the Face of my Beloved. My household is filled with peace and pleasure. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I focus my mind, and embellish and adorn the place within; then I go out to speak with the Saints.<BR>
 Seeking and searching, I have found my Husband Lord; I bow at His Feet and worship Him with devotion. ||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 014</H2></CENTER>
 When my Beloved came to live in my house, I began to sing the songs of bliss.<BR>
 My friends and companions are happy; God leads me to meet the Perfect Guru. ||3||<BR>
 My friends and companions are in ecstasy; the Guru has completed all my projects.<BR>
 Says Nanak, I have met my Husband, the Giver of peace; He shall never leave me and go away. ||4||3||<BR>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 From a king to a worm, and from a worm to the lord of gods, they engage in evil to fill their bellies.<BR>
 They renounce the Lord, the Ocean of Mercy, and worship some other; they are thieves and killers of the soul. ||1||<BR>
 Forgetting the Lord, they suffer in sorrow and die.<BR>
 They wander lost in reincarnation through all sorts of species; they do not find shelter anywhere. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Those who abandon their Lord and Master and think of some other, are foolish, stupid, idiotic donkeys.<BR>
 How can they cross over the ocean in a paper boat? Their eogtistical boasts that they will cross over are meaningless. ||2||<BR>
 Shiva, Brahma, angels and demons, all burn in the fire of death.<BR>
 Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord's Lotus Feet; O God, Creator, please do not send me into exile. ||3||4||<BR>
 Raag Malaar, Fifth Mehl, Du-Padas, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 My God is detached and free of desire.<BR>
 I cannot survive without Him, even for an instant. I am so in love with Him. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Associating with the Saints, God has come into my consciousness. By their Grace, I have been awakened.<BR>
 Hearing the Teachings, my mind has become immaculate. Imbued with the Lord's Love, I sing His Glorious Praises. ||1||<BR>
 Dedicating this mind, I have made friends with the Saints. They have become merciful to me; I am very fortunate.<BR>
 I have found absolute peace - I cannot describe it. Nanak has obtained the dust of the feet of the humble. ||2||1||5||<BR>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 O mother, please lead me to union with my Beloved.<BR>
 All my friends and companions sleep totally in peace; their Beloved Lord has come into the homes of their hearts. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I am worthless; God is forever Merciful. I am unworthy; what clever tricks could I try?<BR>
 I claim to be on a par with those who are imbued with the Love of their Beloved. This is my stubborn egotism. ||1||<BR>
 I am dishonored - I seek the Sanctuary of the One, the Guru, the True Guru, the Primal Being, the Giver of peace.<BR>
 In an instant, all my pains have been taken away; Nanak passes the night of his life in peace. ||2||2||6||<BR>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Rain down, O cloud; do not delay.<BR>
 O beloved cloud, O support of the mind, you bring lasting bliss and joy to the mind. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I take to Your Support, O my Lord and Master; how could You forget me?<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 015</H2></CENTER>
 I am Your beautiful bride, Your servant and slave. I have no nobility without my Husband Lord. ||1||<BR>
 When my Lord and Master listened to my prayer, He hurried to shower me with His Mercy.<BR>
 Says Nanak, I have become just like my Husband Lord; I am blessed with honor, nobility and the lifestyle of goodness. ||2||3||7||<BR>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Meditate on the True Name of your Beloved.<BR>
 The pains and sorrows of the terrifying world-ocean are dispelled, by enshrining the Image of the Guru within your heart. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Your enemies shall be destroyed, and all the evil-doers shall perish, when you come to the Sanctuary of the Lord.<BR>
 The Savior Lord has given me His Hand and saved me; I have obtained the wealth of the Naam. ||1||<BR>
 Granting His Grace, He has eradicated all my sins; He has placed the Immaculate Naam within my mind.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Treasure of Virtue fills my mind; I shall never again suffer in pain. ||2||4||8||<BR>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 My Beloved God is the Lover of my breath of life.<BR>
 Please bless me with the loving devotional worship of the Naam, O Kind and Compassionate Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I meditate in remembrance on Your Feet, O my Beloved; my heart is filled with hope.<BR>
 I offer my prayer to the humble Saints; my mind thirsts for the Blssed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||1||<BR>
 Separation is death, and Union with the Lord is life. Please bless Your humble servant with Your Darshan.<BR>
 O my God, please be Merciful, and bless Nanak with the support, the life and wealth of the Naam. ||2||5||9||<BR>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Now, I have become just like my Beloved.<BR>
 Dwelling on my Sovereign Lord King, I have found peace. Rain down, O peace-giving cloud. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I cannot forget Him, even for an instant; He is the Ocean of peace. Through the Naam, the Name of the Lord, I have obtained the nine treasures.<BR>
 My perfect destiny has been activated, meeting with the Saints, my help and support. ||1||<BR>
 Peace has welled up, and all pain has been dispelled, lovingly attuned to the Supreme Lord God.<BR>
 The arduous and terrifying world-ocean is crossed over, O Nanak, by meditating on the Feet of the Lord. ||2||6||10||<BR>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The clouds have rained down all over the world.<BR>
 My Beloved Lord God has become merciful to me; I am blessed with ecstasy, bliss and peace. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 My sorrows are erased, and all my thirsts are quenched, meditating on the Supreme Lord God.<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, death and birth come to an end, and the mortal does not wander anywhere, ever again. ||1||<BR>
 My mind and body are imbued with the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord; I am lovingly attuned to His Lotus Feet.<BR>
 God has made Nanak His Own; slave Nanak seeks His Sanctuary. ||2||7||11||<BR>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Separated from the Lord, how can any living being live?<BR>
 My consciousness is filled with yearning and hope to meet my Lord, and drink in the sublime essence of His Lotus Feet. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Those who are thirsty for You, O my Beloved, are not separated from You.<BR>
 Those who forget my Beloved Lord are dead and dying. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 016</H2></CENTER>
 The Lord of the Universe is permeating and pervading my mind and body; I see Him Ever-present, here and now<BR>
 . O Nanak, He is permeating the inner being of all; He is all-pervading everywhere. ||2||8||12||<BR>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Vibrating and meditating on the Lord, who has not been carried across?<BR>
 Those reborn into the body of a bird, the body of a fish, the body of a deer, and the body of a bull - in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, they are saved. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The families of gods, the families of demons, titans, celestial singers and human beings are carried across the ocean.<BR>
 Whoever meditates and vibrates on the Lord in the Saadh Sangat - his pains are taken away. ||1||<BR>
 Sexual desire, anger and the pleasures of terrible corruption - he keeps away from these.<BR>
 He meditates on the Lord, Merciful to the meek, the Embodiment of Compassion; Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him. ||2||9||13||<BR>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Today, I am seated in the Lord's store.<BR>
 With the wealth of the Lord, I have entered into partnership with the humble; I shall not have take the Highway of Death. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Showering me with His Kindness, the Supreme Lord God has saved me; the doors of doubt have been opened wide.<BR>
 I have found God, the Banker of Infinity; I have earned the profit of the wealth of His Feet. ||1||<BR>
 I have grasped the protection of the Sanctuary of the Unchanging, Unmoving, Imperishable Lord; He has picked up my sins and thrown them out.<BR>
 Slave Nanak's sorrow and suffering has ended. He shall never again be squeezed into the mold of reincarnation. ||2||10||14||<BR>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 In so many ways, attachment to Maya leads to ruin.<BR>
 Among millions, it is very rare to find a selfless servant who remains a perfect devotee for very long. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Roaming and wandering here and there, the mortal finds only trouble; his body and wealth become strangers to himself.<BR>
 Hiding from people, he practices deception; he does not know the One who is always with him. ||1||<BR>
 He wanders through troubled incarnations of low and wretched species as a deer, a bird and a fish.<BR>
 Says Nanak, O God, I am a stone - please carry me across, that I may enjoy peace in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||2||11||15||<BR>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The cruel and evil ones died after taking poison, O mother.<BR>
 And the One, to whom all creatures belong, has saved us. God has granted His Grace. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, is contained within all; why should I be afraid, O Siblings of Destiny?<BR>
 God, my Help and Support, is always with me. He shall never leave; I see Him everywhere. ||1||<BR>
 He is the Master of the masterless, the Destroyer of the pains of the poor; He has attached me to the hem of His robe.<BR>
 O Lord, Your slaves live by Your Support; Nanak has come to the Sanctuary of God. ||2||12||16||<BR>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 O my mind, dwell on the Feet of the Lord.<BR>
 My mind is enticed by thirst for the Blessed Vision of the Lord; I would take wings and fly out to meet Him. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Searching and seeking, I have found the Path, and now I serve the Holy.<BR>
 O my Lord and Master, please be kind to me, that I may drink in Your most sublime essence. ||1||<BR>
 Begging and pleading, I have come to Your Sanctuary; I am on fire - please shower me with Your Mercy!<BR>
 Please give me Your Hand - I am Your slave, O Lord. Please make Nanak Your Own. ||2||13||17||<BR>

 It is God's Nature to love His devotees.<BR>
 He destroys the slanderers, crushing them beneath His Feet. His Glory is manifest everywhere. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 His Victory is celebrated all throughout the world. He blesses all creatures with compassion.<BR>
 Hugging him close in His Embrace, the Lord saves and protects His slave. The hot winds cannot even touch him. ||1||<BR>
 My Lord and Master has made me His Own; dispelling my doubts and fears, He has made me happy.<BR>
 The Lord's slaves enjoy ultimate ecstasy; O Nanak, faith has welled up in my mind. ||2||14||18||<BR>

 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The Gurmukh sees God pervading everywhere.<BR>
 The Gurmukh knows that the universe is the extension of the three gunas, the three dispositions.<BR>
 The Gurmukh reflects on the Sound-current of the Naad, and the wisdom of the Vedas.<BR>
 Without the Perfect Guru, there is only pitch-black darkness. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, calling on the Guru, eternal peace is found.<BR>
 Following the Guru's Teachings, the Lord comes to dwell within the heart; I meditate on my Lord and Master with every breath and morsel of food. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to the Guru's Feet.<BR>
 Night and day, I continually sing the Glorious Praises of the Guru.<BR>
 I take my cleansing bath in the dust of the Guru's Feet.<BR>
 I am honored in the True Court of the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 The Guru is the boat, to carry me across the terrifying world-ocean.<BR>
 Meeting with the Guru, I shall not be reincarnated ever again.<BR>
 That humble being serves the Guru,<BR>
 who has such karma inscribed on his forehead by the Primal Lord. ||3||<BR>
 The Guru is my life; the Guru is my support.<BR>
 The Guru is my way of life; the Guru is my family.<BR>
 The Guru is my Lord and Master; I seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Guru is the Supreme Lord God; His value cannot be estimated. ||4||1||19||<BR>

 I enshrine the Lord's Feet within my heart;<BR>
 in His Mercy, God has united me with Himself.<BR>
 God enjoins His servant to his tasks.<BR>
 His worth cannot be expressed. ||1||<BR>
 Please be merciful to me, O Perfect Giver of peace.<BR>
 By Your Grace, You come to mind; I am imbued with Your Love, twenty-four hours a day. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Singing and listening, it is all by Your Will.<BR>
 One who understands the Hukam of Your Command is absorbed in Truth.<BR>
 Chanting and meditating on Your Name, I live.<BR>
 Without You, there is no place at all. ||2||<BR>
 Pain and pleasure come by Your Command, O Creator Lord.<BR>
 By the Pleasure of Your Will You forgive, and by the Pleasure of Your Will You award punishment.<BR>
 You are the Creator of both realms.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to Your Glorious Grandeur. ||3||<BR>

 O my mind, praise the Perfect Guru.<BR>
 Chant the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, day and night. You shall obtain the fruits of your mind's desires. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 No one else is as great as the True Guru.<BR>
 The Guru is the Supreme Lord, the Transcendent Lord God.<BR>
 He saves us from the pains of death and birth,<BR>
 and we will not have to taste the poison of Maya ever again. ||2||<BR>
 The Guru's glorious grandeur cannot be described.<BR>
 The Guru is the Transcendent Lord, in the True Name.<BR>
 True is His self-discipline, and True are all His actions.<BR>
 Immaculate and pure is that mind, which is imbued with love for the Guru. ||3||<BR>
 The Perfect Guru is obtained by great good fortune.<BR>
 Drive out sexual desire, anger and greed from your mind.<BR>
 By His Grace, the Guru's Feet are enshrined within.<BR>
 Nanak offers his prayer to the True Lord God. ||4||4||22||<BR>

 Pleasing the Guru, I have fallen in love with my Merciful Beloved Lord.<BR>
 I have made all my decorations,<BR>
 and renounced all corruption;<BR>
 my wandering mind has become steady and stable. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 O my mind, lose your self-conceit by associating with the Holy, and you shall find Him.<BR>
 The unstruck celestial melody vibrates and resounds; like a song-bird, chant the Lord's Name, with words of sweetness and utter beauty. ||1||<BR>
 Such is the glory of Your Darshan, so utterly inifinte and fruitful, O my Love; so do we become by associating with the Saints.<BR>
 Vibrating, chanting Your Name, we cross over the terrifying world-ocean.<BR>
 They dwell on the Lord, Raam, Raam, chanting on their malas;<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 019</H2></CENTER>
 their minds are turned towards the Lord in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<BR>
 O servant Nanak, their Beloved Lord seems so sweet to them. ||2||1||23||<BR>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 My mind wanders through the dense forest.<BR>
 It walks with eagerness and love,<BR>
 hoping to meet God. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Maya with her three gunas - the three dispositions - has come to entice me; whom can I tell of my pain? ||1||<BR>
 I tried everything else, but nothing could rid me of my sorrow.<BR>
 So hurry to the Sanctuary of the Holy, O Nanak; joining them, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe. ||2||2||24||<BR>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The glory of my Beloved is noble and sublime.<BR>
 The celestial singers and angels sing His Sublime Praises in ecstasy, happiness and joy. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The most worthy beings sing God's Praises in beautiful harmonies, in all sorts of ways, in myriads of sublime forms. ||1||<BR>
 Throughout the mountains, trees, deserts, oceans and galaxies, permeating each and every heart, the sublime grandeur of my Love is totally pervading.<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the Love of the Lord is found; O Nanak, sublime is that faith. ||2||3||25||<BR>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 With love for the Guru, I enshrine the Lotus Feet of my Lord deep within my heart. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I gaze on the Blessed Vision of His Fruitful Darshan; my sins are erased and taken away.<BR>
 My mind is immaculate and enlightened. ||1||<BR>
 I am wonderstruck, stunned and amazed.<BR>
 Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, millions of sins are destroyed.<BR>
 I fall at His Feet, and touch my forehead to them.<BR>
 You alone are, You alone are, O God.<BR>
 Your devotees take Your Support.<BR>
 Servant Nanak has come to the Door of Your Sanctuary. ||2||4||26||<BR>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Rain down with happiness in God's Will.<BR>
 Bless me with total bliss and good fortune. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 My mind blossoms forth in the Society of the Saints; soaking up the rain, the earth is blessed and beautified. ||1||<BR>
 The peacock loves the thunder of the rain clouds.<BR>
 The rainbird's mind is drawn to the rain-drop<BR>
 - so is my mind enticed by the Lord.<BR>
 I have renounced Maya, the deceiver.<BR>
 Joining with the Saints, Nanak is awakened. ||2||5||27||<BR>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Sing forever the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the World.<BR>
 Enshrine the Lord's Name in your consciousness. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Forsake your pride, and abandon your ego; join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<BR>
 Meditate in loving remembrance on the One Lord; your sorrows shall be ended, O friend. ||1||<BR>
 The Supreme Lord God has become merciful;<BR>
 corrupt entanglements have come to an end.<BR>
 Grasping the feet of the Holy,<BR>
 Nanak sings forever the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the World. ||2||6||28||<BR>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The Embodiment of the Lord of the Universe roars like the thunder-cloud.<BR>
 Singing His Glorious Praises brings peace and bliss. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Sanctuary of the Lord's Feet carries us across the world-ocean. His Sublime Word is the unstruck celestial melody. ||1||<BR>
 The thirsty traveller's consciousness obtains the water of the soul from the pool of nectar.<BR>
 Servant Nanak loves the Blessed Vision of the Lord; in His Mercy, God has blessed him with it. ||2||7||29||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 020</H2></CENTER>
 Malaar, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 O Lord of the Universe, O Lord of the World, O Dear Merciful Beloved. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You are the Master of the breath of life, the Companion of the lost and forsaken, the Destroyer of the pains of the poor. ||1||<BR>
 O All-powerful, Inaccessible, Perfect Lord, please shower me with Your Mercy. ||2||<BR>
 Please, carry Nanak across the terrible, deep dark pit of the world to the other side. ||3||8||30||<BR>
 Malaar, First Mehl, Ashtapadees, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The chakvi bird does not long for sleepy eyes; without her beloved, she does not sleep.<BR>
 When the sun rises, she sees her beloved with her eyes; she bows and touches his feet. ||1||<BR>
 The Love of my Beloved is pleasing; it is my Companion and Support.<BR>
 Without Him, I cannot live in this world even for an instant; such is my hunger and thirst. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The lotus in the pool blossoms forth intuitively and naturally, with the rays of the sun in the sky.<BR>
 Such is the love for my Beloved which imbues me; my light has merged into the Light. ||2||<BR>
 Without water, the rainbird cries out, "Pri-o! Pri-o! - Beloved! Beloved!" It cries and wails and laments.<BR>
 The thundering clouds rain down in the ten directions; its thirst is not quenched until it catches the rain-drop in its mouth. ||3||<BR>
 The fish lives in water, from which it was born. It finds peace and pleasure according to its past actions.<BR>
 It cannot survive without water for a moment, even for an instant. Life and death depend on it. ||4||<BR>
 The soul-bride is separated from her Husband Lord, who lives in His Own Country. He sends the Shabad, His Word, through the True Guru.<BR>
 She gathers virtues, and enshrines God within her heart. Imbued with devotion, she is happy. ||5||<BR>
 Everyone cries out, "Beloved! Beloved!" But she alone finds her Beloved, who is pleasing to the Guru.<BR>
 Our Beloved is always with us; through the Truth, He blesses us with His Grace, and unites us in His Union. ||6||<BR>
 He is the life of the soul in each and every soul; He permeates and pervades each and every heart.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, He is revealed within the home of my heart; I am intuitively, naturally, absorbed into Him. ||7||<BR>
 He Himself shall resolve all your affairs, when you meet with the Giver of peace, the Lord of the World.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, you shall find your Husband Lord within your own home; then, O Nanak, the fire within you shall be quenched. ||8||1||<BR>
 Malaar, First Mehl:<BR>
 Remain awake and aware, serving the Guru; except for the Lord, no one is mine.<BR>
 Even by making all sorts of efforts, you shall not remain here; it shall melt like glass in the fire. ||1||<BR>
 Tell me - why are you so proud of your body and wealth?<BR>
 They shall vanish in an instant; O madman, this is how the world is wasting away, in egotism and pride. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Hail to the Lord of the Universe, God, our Saving Grace; He judges and saves the mortal beings.<BR>
 All that is, belongs to You. No one else is equal to You. ||2||<BR>
 Creating all beings and creatures, their ways and means are under Your control; You bless the Gurmukhs with the ointment of spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 My Eternal, Unmastered Lord is over the heads of all. He is the Destroyer of death and rebirth, doubt and fear. ||3||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 021</H2></CENTER>
 This wretched world is a fortress of paper, of color and form and clever tricks.<BR>
 A tiny drop of water or a little puff of wind destroys its glory; in an instant, its life is ended. ||4||<BR>
 It is like a tree-house near the bank of a river, with a serpent's den in that house.<BR>
 When the river overflows, what happens to the tree house? The snake bites, like duality in the mind. ||5||<BR>
 Through the magic spell of the Guru's spiritual wisdom, and meditation on the Word of the Guru's Teachings, vice and corruption are burnt away.<BR>
 The mind and body are cooled and soothed and Truth is obtained, through the wondrous and unique devotional worship of the Lord. ||6||<BR>
 All that exists begs of You; You are merciful to all beings.<BR>
 I seek Your Sanctuary; please save my honor, O Lord of the World, and bless me with Truth. ||7||<BR>
 Bound in worldly affairs and entanglements, the blind one does not understand; he acts like a murderous butcher.<BR>
 But if he meets with the True Guru, then he comprehends and understands, and his mind is imbued with true spiritual wisdom. ||8||<BR>
 Without the Truth, this worthless body is false; I have consulted my Guru on this.<BR>
 O Nanak, that God has revealed God to me; without the Truth, all the world is just a dream. ||9||2||<BR>
 Malaar, First Mehl:<BR>
 The rainbird and the fish find peace in water; the deer is pleased by the sound of the bell. ||1||<BR>
 The rainbird chirps in the night, O my mother. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 O my Beloved, my love for You shall never end, if it is Your Will. ||2||<BR>
 Sleep is gone, and egotism is exhausted from my body; my heart is permeated with the Teachings of Truth. ||3||<BR>
 Flying among the trees and plants, I remain hungry; lovingly drinking in the Naam, the Name of the Lord, I am satisfied. ||4||<BR>
 I stare at You, and my tongue cries out to You; I am so thirsty for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||5||<BR>
 Without my Beloved, the more I decorate myself, the more my body burns; these clothes do not look good on my body. ||6||<BR>
 Without my Beloved, I cannot survive even for an instant; without meeting Him, I cannot sleep. ||7||<BR>
 Her Husband Lord is nearby, but the wretched bride does not know it. The True Guru reveals Him to her. ||8||<BR>
 When she meets Him with intuitive ease, she finds peace; the Word of the Shabad quenches the fire of desire. ||9||<BR>
 Says Nanak, through You, O Lord, my mind is pleased and appeased; I cannot express Your worth. ||10||3||<BR>
 Malaar, First Mehl, Ashtapadees, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The earth bends under the weight of the water,<BR>
 the lofty mountains and the caverns of the underworld.<BR>
 Contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the oceans become calm.<BR>
 The path of liberation is found by subduing the ego. ||1||<BR>
 I am blind; I seek the Light of the Name.<BR>
 I take the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. I walk on the path of mystery of the Guru's Fear. ||1||Pause||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 022</H2></CENTER>
 Through the Shabad, the Word of the True Guru, the Path is known.<BR>
 With the Guru's Support, one is blessed with the strength of the True Lord.<BR>
 Dwell on the Naam, and realize the Beauteous Word of His Bani.<BR>
 If it is Your Will, Lord, You lead me to find Your Door. ||2||<BR>
 Flying high or sitting down, I am lovingly focused on the One Lord.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I take the Naam as my Suppport.<BR>
 There is no ocean of water, no mountain ranges rising up.<BR>
 I dwell within the home of my own inner being, where there is no path and no one travelling on it. ||3||<BR>
 You alone know the way to that House in which You dwell. No one else knows the Mansion of Your Presence.<BR>
 Without the True Guru, there is no understanding. The whole world is buried under its nightmare.<BR>
 The mortal tries all sorts of things, and weeps and wails, but without the Guru, he does not know the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 In the twinkling of an eye, the Naam saves him, if he realizes the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||4||<BR>
 Some are foolish, blind, stupid and ignorant.<BR>
 Some, through fear of the True Guru, take the Support of the Naam.<BR>
 The True Word of His Bani is sweet, the source of ambrosial nectar.<BR>
 Whoever drinks it in, finds the Door of Salvation. ||5||<BR>
 One who, through the love and fear of God, enshrines the Naam within his heart, acts according to the Guru's Instructions and knows the True Bani.<BR>
 When the clouds release their rain, the earth becomes beautiful; God's Light permeates each and every heart.<BR>
 The evil-minded ones plant their seed in the barren soil; such is the sign of those who have no Guru.<BR>
 Without the True Guru, there is utter darkness; they drown there, even without water. ||6||<BR>
 Whatever God does, is by His Own Will.<BR>
 That which is pre-ordained cannot be erased.<BR>
 Bound to the Hukam of the Lord's Command, the mortal does his deeds.<BR>
 Permeated by the One Word of the Shabad, the mortal is immersed in Truth. ||7||<BR>
 Your Command, O God, rules in the four directions; Your Name pervades the four corners of the nether regions as well.<BR>
 The True Word of the Shabad is pervading amongst all. By His Grace, the Eternal One unites us with Himself.<BR>
 Birth and death hang over the heads of all beings, along with hunger, sleep and dying.<BR>
 The Naam is pleasing to Nanak's mind; O True Lord, Source of bliss, please bless me with Your Grace. ||8||1||4||<BR>
 Malaar, First Mehl:<BR>
 You do not understand the nature of death and liberation.<BR>
 You are sitting on the river-bank; realize the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||<BR>
 You stork! - how were you caught in the net?<BR>
 You do not remember in your heart the Unseen Lord God. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 For your one life, you consume many lives.<BR>
 You were supposed to swim in the water, but you are drowning in it instead. ||2||<BR>
 You have tormented all beings.<BR>
 When Death seizes you, then you shall regret and repent. ||3||<BR>
 When the heavy noose is placed around your neck,<BR>
 you may spread your wings, but you shall not be able to fly. ||4||<BR>
 You enjoy the tastes and flavors, you foolish self-willed manmukh.<BR>
 You are trapped. You can only be saved by virtuous conduct, spiritual wisdom and contemplation. ||5||<BR>
 Serving the True Guru, you will shatter the Messenger of Death.<BR>
 In your heart, dwell on the True Word of the Shabad. ||6||<BR>
 The Guru's Teachings, the True Word of the Shabad, is excellent and sublime.<BR>
 Keep the Name of the Lord enshrined in your heart. ||7||<BR>
 One who is obsessed with enjoying pleasures here, shall suffer in pain hereafter.<BR>
 O Nanak, there is no liberation without the True Name. ||8||2||5||<BR>

 Malaar, Third Mehl, Ashtapadees, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 If it is in his karma, then he finds the True Guru; without such karma, He cannot be found.<BR>
 He meets the True Guru, and he is transformed into gold, if it is the Lord's Will. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, focus your consciousness on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 The Lord is found through the True Guru, and then he remains merged with the True Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Spiritual wisdom wells up through the True Guru, and then this cynicism is dispelled.<BR>
 Through the True Guru, the Lord is realized, and then, he is not consigned to the womb of reincarnation ever again. ||2||<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, the mortal dies in life, and by so dying, lives to practice the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 He alone finds the Door of Salvation, who eradicates self-conceit from within himself. ||3||<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, the mortal is reincarnated into the Home of the Lord, having eradicated Maya from within.<BR>
 He eats the uneatable, and is blessed with a discriminating intellect; he meets the Supreme Person, the Primal Lord God. ||4||<BR>
 The world is unconscious, like a passing show; the mortal departs, having lost his capital.<BR>
 The profit of the Lord is obtained in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation; by good karma, it is found. ||5||<BR>
 Without the True Guru, no one finds it; see this in your mind, and consider this in your heart.<BR>
 By great good fortune, the mortal finds the Guru, and crosses over the terrifying world-ocean. ||6||<BR>
 The Name of the Lord is my Anchor and Support. I take only the Support of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 O Dear Lord, please be kind and lead me to meet the Guru, that I may find the Door of Salvation. ||7||<BR>
 The pre-ordained destiny inscribed on the mortal's forehead by our Lord and Master cannot be erased.<BR>
 O Nanak, those humble beings are perfect, who are pleased by the Lord's Will. ||8||1||<BR>
 Malaar, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The world is involved with the words of the Vedas, thinking about the three gunas - the three dispositions.<BR>
 Without the Name, it suffers punishment by the Messenger of Death; it comes and goes in reincarnation, over and over again.<BR>
 Meeting with the True Guru, the world is liberated, and finds the Door of Salvation. ||1||<BR>
 O mortal, immerse yourself in service to the True Guru.<BR>
 By great good fortune, the mortal finds the Perfect Guru, and meditates on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Lord, by the Pleasure of His Own Will, created the Universe, and the Lord Himself gives it sustenance and support.<BR>
 The Lord, by His Own Will, makes the mortal's mind immaculate, and lovingly attunes him to the Lord.<BR>
 The Lord, by His Own Will, leads the mortal to meet the True Guru, the Embellisher of all his lives. ||2||<BR>
 Waaho! Waaho! Blessed and Great is the True Word of His Bani. Only a few, as Gurmukh, understand.<BR>
 Waaho! Waaho! Praise God as Great! No one else is as Great as He.<BR>
 When God's Grace is received, He Himself forgives the mortal, and unites him with Himself. ||3||<BR>
 The True Guru has revealed our True, Supreme Lord and Master.<BR>
 The Ambrosial Nectar rains down and the mind is satisfied, remaining lovingly attuned to the True Lord.<BR>
 In the Lord's Name, it is forever rejuvenated; it shall never wither and dry up again. ||4||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 024</H2></CENTER>
 Without the True Guru, no one finds the Lord; anyone can try and see.<BR>
 By the Lord's Grace, the True Guru is found, and then the Lord is met with intuitive ease.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh is deluded by doubt; without good destiny, the Lord's wealth is not obtained. ||5||<BR>
 The three dispositions are completely distracting; people read and study and contemplate them.<BR>
 Those people are never liberated; they do not find the Door of Salvation.<BR>
 Without the True Guru, they are never released from bondage; they do not embrace love for the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||6||<BR>
 The Pandits, the religious scholars, and the silent sages, reading and studying the Vedas, have grown weary.<BR>
 They do not even think of the Lord's Name; they do not dwell in the home of their own inner being.<BR>
 The Messenger of Death hovers over their heads; they are ruined by the deceit within themselves. ||7||<BR>
 Everyone longs for the Name of the Lord; without good destiny, it is not obtained.<BR>
 When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, the mortal meets the True Guru, and the Lord's Name comes to dwell within the mind.<BR>
 O Nanak, through the Name, honor wells up, and the mortal remains immersed in the Lord. ||8||2||<BR>
 Malaar, Third Mehl, Ashtapadees, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 When the Lord shows His Mercy, He enjoins the mortal to work for the Guru.<BR>
 His pains are taken away, and the Lord's Name comes to dwell within.<BR>
 True deliverance comes by focusing one's consciousness on the True Lord.<BR>
 Listen to the Shabad, and the Word of the Guru's Bani. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, serve the Lord, Har, Har, the true treasure.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, the wealth of the Lord is obtained. Night and day, focus your meditation on the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The soul-bride who adorns herself without her Husband Lord,<BR>
 is ill-mannered and vile, wasted away into ruin.<BR>
 This is the useless way of life of the self-willed manmukh.<BR>
 Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he performs all sorts of empty rituals. ||2||<BR>
 The bride who is Gurmukh is beautifully embellished.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Shabad, she enshrines her Husband Lord within her heart.<BR>
 She realizes the One Lord, and subdues her ego.<BR>
 That soul-bride is virtuous and noble. ||3||<BR>
 Without the Guru, the Giver, no one finds the Lord.<BR>
 The greedy self-willed manmukh is attracted and engrossed in duality.<BR>
 Only a few spiritual teachers realize this,<BR>
 that without meeting the Guru, liberation is not obtained. ||4||<BR>
 Everyone tells the stories told by others.<BR>
 Without subduing the mind, devotional worship does not come.<BR>
 When the intellect achieves spiritual wisdom, the heart-lotus blossoms forth.<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to abide in that heart. ||5||<BR>
 In egotism, everyone can pretend to worship God with devotion.<BR>
 But this does not soften the mind, and it does not bring peace.<BR>
 By speaking and preaching, the mortal only shows off his self-conceit.<BR>
 His devotional worship is useless, and his life is a total waste. ||6||<BR>
 They alone are devotees, who are pleasing to the Mind of the True Guru.<BR>
 Night and day, they remain lovingly attuned to the Name.<BR>
 They behold the Naam, the Name of the Lord, ever-present, near at hand.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 025</H2></CENTER>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is pervading and permeating everywhere. ||7||<BR>
 God Himself forgives, and bestows His Love.<BR>

 By Guru's Grace, this disease is cured.<BR>

 My Beloved Lord is the Giver of loving devotional worship.<BR>
 His humble servants are imbued with His Love.<BR>
 He is imbued with His servants, day and night; He does not forget them from His Mind, even for an instant.<BR>
 He is the Lord of the World, the Treasure of virtue; He is always with me. All glorious virtues belong to the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 With His Feet, He has fascinated my mind; as His humble servant, I am intoxicated with love for His Name.<BR>
 O Nanak, my Beloved is forever Merciful; out of millions, hardly anyone realizes Him. ||1||<BR>
 O Beloved, Your state is inaccessible and infinite.<BR>
 You save even the worst sinners.<BR>
 He is the Purifier of sinners, the Lover of His devotees, the Ocean of mercy, our Lord and Master.<BR>
 In the Society of the Saints, vibrate and meditate on Him with commitment forever; He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.<BR>
 Those who wander in reincarnation through millions of births, are saved and carried across, by meditating in remembrance on the Naam.<BR>
 Nanak is thirsty for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, O Dear Lord; please take care of him. ||2||<BR>
 My mind is absorbed in the Lotus Feet of the Lord.<BR>
 O God, You are the water; Your humble servants are fish.<BR>
 O Dear God, You alone are the water and the fish. I know that there is no difference between the two.<BR>
 Please take hold of my arm and bless me with Your Name. I am honored only by Your Grace.<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, vibrate and meditate with love on the One Lord of the Universe, who is Merciful to the meek.<BR>
 Nanak, the lowly and helpless, seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord, who in His Kindness has made him His Own. ||3||<BR>
 He unites us with Himself.<BR>
 Our Sovereign Lord King is the Destroyer of fear.<BR>
 My Wondrous Lord and Master is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. My Beloved, the Treasure of virtue, has met me.<BR>
 Supreme happiness and peace well up, as I cherish the Glorious Virtues of the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 Meeting with Him, I am embellished and exalted; gazing on Him, I am fascinated, and I realize my pre-ordained destiny.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, I seek the Sanctuary of those who meditate on the Lord, Har, Har. ||4||1||<BR>

 Everything becomes green and lush; the pools and ponds are filled to overflowing.<BR>
 The inner self is imbued with the deep crimson color of love for the True Lord.<BR>
 The heart-lotus blossoms forth and the mind becomes true; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it is ecstatic and exalted.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 026</H2></CENTER>
 The self-willed manmukh is on the wrong side. You can see this with your own eyes.<BR>
 He is caught in the trap like the deer; the Messenger of Death hovers over his head.<BR>
 Hunger, thirst and slander are evil; sexual desire and anger are horrible.<BR>
 These cannot be seen with your eyes, until you contemplate the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 Whoever is pleasing to You is content; all his entanglements are gone.<BR>
 Serving the Guru, his capital is preserved. The Guru is the ladder and the boat.<BR>
 O Nanak, whoever is attached to the Lord receives the essence; O True Lord, You are found when the mind is true. ||1||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 There is one path and one door. The Guru is the ladder to reach one's own place.<BR>
 Our Lord and Master is so beautiful, O Nanak; all comfort and peace are in the Name of the True Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 He Himself created Himself; He Himself understands Himself.<BR>
 Separating the sky and the earth, He has spread out His canopy.<BR>
 Without any pillars, He supports the sky, through the insignia of His Shabad.<BR>
 Creating the sun and the moon, He infused His Light into them.<BR>
 He created the night and the day; Wondrous are His miraculous plays.<BR>
 He created the sacred shrines of pilgrimage, where people contemplate righteousness and Dharma, and take cleansing baths on special occasions.<BR>
 There is no other equal to You; how can we speak and describe You?<BR>
 You are seated on the throne of Truth; all others come and go in reincarnation. ||1||<BR>
 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
 O Nanak, when it rains in the month of Saawan, four are delighted:<BR>
 the snake, the deer, the fish and the wealthy people who seek pleasure. ||1||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 O Nanak, when it rains in the month of Saawan, four suffer the pains of separation:<BR>
 the cow's calves, the poor, the travellers and the servants. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 You are True, O True Lord; You dispense True Justice.<BR>
 Like a lotus, You sit in the primal celestial trance; You are hidden from view.<BR>
 Brahma is called great, but even he does not know Your limits.<BR>
 You have no father or mother; who gave birth to You?<BR>
 You have no form or feature; You transcend all social classes.<BR>
 You have no hunger or thirst; You are satisfied and satiated.<BR>
 You have merged Yourself into the Guru; You are pervading through the Word of Your Shabad.<BR>
 When he is pleasing to the True Lord, the mortal merges in Truth. ||2||<BR>
 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
 The physician was called in; he touched my arm and felt my pulse.<BR>
 The foolish physician did not know that the pain was in the mind. ||1||<BR>
 Second Mehl:<BR>
 O physician, you are a competent physician, if you first diagnose the disease.<BR>
 Prescribe such a remedy, by which all sorts of illnesses may be cured.<BR>
 Administer that medicine, which will cure the disease, and allow peace to come and dwell in the body.<BR>
 Only when you are rid of your own disease, O Nanak, will you be known as a physician. ||2||<BR>

 Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and the deities were created.<BR>
 Brahma was given the Vedas, and enjoined to worship God.<BR>
 The ten incarnations, and Rama the king, came into being.<BR>
 According to His Will, they quickly killed all the demons.<BR>
 Shiva serves Him, but cannot find His limits.<BR>
 He established His throne on the principles of Truth.<BR>
 He enjoined all the world to its tasks, while He keeps Himself hidden from view.<BR>

 They have entered the arena with pomp and ceremony; the Gurmukhs are joyful.<BR>
 The false and foolish self-willed manmukhs are defeated and overcome.<BR>
 The Lord Himself wrestles, and He Himself defeats them. He Himself staged this play.<BR>
 The One God is the Lord and Master of all; this is known by the Gurmukhs.<BR>

 Hanging low, low and thick in the sky, the clouds are changing color.<BR>
 How do I know whether my love for my Husband Lord shall endure?<BR>
 The love of those soul-brides endures, if their minds are filled with the Love and the Fear of God.<BR>
 O Nanak, she who has no Love and Fear of God - her body shall never find peace. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 Hanging low, low and thick in the sky, the clouds come, and pure water rains down.<BR>
 O Nanak, that soul-bride suffers in pain, whose mind is torn away from her Husband Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The One Lord created both sides and pervades the expanse.<BR>
 The words of the Vedas became pervasive, with arguments and divisions.<BR>
 Attachment and detachment are the two sides of it; Dharma, true religion, is the guide between the two.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs are worthless and false. Without a doubt, they lose in the Court of the Lord.<BR>
 Those who follow the Guru's Teachings are the true spiritual warriors; they have conquered sexual desire and anger.<BR>
 They enter into the True Mansion of the Lord's Presence, embellished and exalted by the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 Those devotees are pleasing to Your Will, O Lord; they dearly love the True Name.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to those who serve their True Guru. ||5||<BR>

 Hanging low, low and thick in the sky, the clouds come, and water rains down in torrents.<BR>
 O Nanak, she walks in harmony with the Will of her Husband Lord; she enjoys peace and pleasure forever. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 Why are you standing up, standing up to look? You poor wretch, this cloud has nothing in its hands.<BR>
 The One who sent this cloud - cherish Him in your mind.<BR>
 He alone enshrines the Lord in his mind, upon whom the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace.<BR>
 O Nanak, all those who lack this Grace, cry and weep and wail. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Serve the Lord forever; He acts in no time at all.<BR>
 He stretched the sky across the heavens; in an instant, He creates and destroys.<BR>
 He Himself created the world; He contemplates His Creative Omnipotence.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh will be called to account hereafter; he will be severely punished.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 028</H2></CENTER>
 The Gurmukh's account is settled with honor; the Lord blesses him with the treasure of His Praise.<BR>
 No one's hands can reach there; no one will hear anyone's cries.<BR>
 The True Guru will be your best friend there; at the very last instant, He will save you.<BR>
 These beings should serve no other than the True Guru or the Creator Lord above the heads of all. ||6||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 O rainbird, the One unto whom you call - everyone longs for that Lord.<BR>
 When He grants His Grace, it rains, and the forests and fields blossom forth in their greenery.<BR>

 O Nanak, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord; He reaches out and gives sustenance to all beings.<BR>
 Eating this, peace is produced, and the mortal never again suffers in pain. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 O Dear Lord, You are the Truest of the True. You blend those who are truthful into Your Own Being.<BR>
 Those caught in duality are on the side of duality; entrenched in falsehood, they cannot merge into the Lord.<BR>
 You Yourself unite, and You Yourself separate; You display Your Creative Omnipotence.<BR>
 Attachment brings the sorrow of separation; the mortal acts in accordance with pre-ordained destiny.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to those who remain lovingly attached to the Lord's Feet.<BR>
 They are like the lotus which remains detached, floating upon the water.<BR>
 They are peaceful and beautiful forever; they eradicate self-conceit from within.<BR>
 They never suffer sorrow or separation; they are merged in the Being of the Lord. ||7||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 O Nanak, praise the Lord; everything is in His power.<BR>
 Serve Him, O mortal beings; there is none other than Him.<BR>

 He is never cynical; all anxiety has been taken out from within him.<BR>
 Whatever happens, happens naturally; no one has any say about it.<BR>

 How can the unweighable be weighed? Without weighing Him, He cannot be obtained.<BR>
 Reflect on the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and immerse yourself in His Glorious Virtues.<BR>
 He Himself weighs Himself; He unites in Union with Himself.<BR>
 His value cannot be estimated; nothing can be said about this.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to my Guru; He has made me realize this true realization.<BR>
 The world has been deceived, and the Ambrosial Nectar is being plundered. The self-willed manmukh does not realize this.<BR>
 Without the Name, nothing will go along with him; he wastes his life, and departs.<BR>
 Those who follow the Guru's Teachings and remain awake and aware, preserve and protect the home of their heart; demons have no power against them. ||8||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 O rainbird, do not cry out. Do not let this mind of yours be so thirsty for a drop of water. Obey the Hukam, the Command of your Lord and Master,<BR>
 and your thirst shall be quenched. Your love for Him shall increase four-fold. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 O rainbird, your place is in the water; you move around in the water.<BR>
 But you do not appreciate the water, and so you cry out.<BR>
 In the water and on the land, it rains down in the ten directions. No place is left dry.<BR>
 With so much rain, those who are die of thirst are very unfortunate.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukhs understand; the Lord abides within their minds. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The Yogic Masters, celibates, Siddhas and spiritual teachers - none of them has found the limits of the Lord.<BR>
 The Gurmukhs meditate on the Naam, and merge in You, O Lord.<BR>
 For thirty-six ages, God remained in utter darkness, as He pleased.<BR>
 The vast expanse of water swirled around.<BR>
 The Creator of all is Infinite, Endless and Inaccessible.<BR>
 He formed fire and conflict, hunger and thirst.<BR>
 Death hangs over the heads of the people of the world, in the love of duality.<BR>
 The Savior Lord saves those who realize the Word of the Shabad. ||9||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 This rain pours down on all; it rains down in accordance with God's Loving Will.<BR>
 Those trees become green and lush, which remain immersed in the Guru's Word.<BR>
 O Nanak, by His Grace, there is peace; the pain of these creatures is gone. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 The night is wet with dew; lightning flashes, and the rain pours down in torrents.<BR>
 Food and wealth are produced in abundance when it rains, if it is the Will of God.<BR>
 Consuming it, the minds of His creatures are satisfied, and they adopt the lifestyle of the way.<BR>
 This wealth is the play of the Creator Lord. Sometimes it comes, and sometimes it goes.<BR>
 The Naam is the wealth of the spiritually wise. It is permeating and pervading forever.<BR>
 O Nanak, those who are blessed with His Glance of Grace receive this wealth. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 He Himself does, and causes all to be done. Unto whom can I complain?<BR>
 He Himself calls the mortal beings to account; He Himself causes them to act.<BR>
 Whatever pleases Him happens. Only a fool issues commands.<BR>
 He Himself saves and redeems; He Himself is the Forgiver.<BR>
 He Himself sees, and He Himself hears; He gives His Support to all.<BR>
 He alone is pervading and permeating all; He considers each and every one.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 030</H2></CENTER>
 The Gurmukh reflects on the self, lovingly attached to the True Lord.<BR>
 O Nanak, whom can we ask? He Himself is the Great Giver. ||10||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 This world is a rainbird; let no one be deluded by doubt.<BR>
 This rainbird is an animal; it has no understanding at all.<BR>
 The Name of the Lord is Ambrosial Nectar; drinking it in, thirst is quenched.<BR>
 O Nanak, those Gurmukhs who drink it in shall never again be afflicted by thirst. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 Malaar is a calming and soothing raga; meditating on the Lord brings peace and tranquility.<BR>
 When the Dear Lord grants His Grace, then the rain falls on all the people of the world.<BR>
 From this rain, all creatures find the ways and means to live, and the earth is embellished.<BR>
 O Nanak, this world is all water; everything came from water.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, a rare few realize the Lord; such humble beings are liberated forever. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 O True and Independent Lord God, You alone are my Lord and Master.<BR>
 You Yourself are everything; who else is of any account?<BR>
 False is the pride of man. True is Your glorious greatness.<BR>
 Coming and going in reincarnation, the beings and species of the world came into being.<BR>
 But if the mortal serves his True Guru, his coming into the world is judged to be worthwhile.<BR>
 And if he eradicates eogtism from within himself, then how can he be judged?<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh is lost in the darkness of emotional attachment, like the man lost in the wilderness.<BR>
 Countless sins are erased, by even a tiny particle of the Lord's Name. ||11||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 O rainbird, you do not know the Mansion of your Lord and Master's Presence. Offer your prayers to see this Mansion.<BR>
 You speak as you please, but your speech is not accepted.<BR>
 Your Lord and Master is the Great Giver; whatever you desire, you shall receive from Him.<BR>
 Not only the thirst of the poor rainbird, but the thirst of the whole world is quenched. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 The night is wet with dew; the rainbird sings the True Name with intuitive ease.<BR>
 This water is my very soul; without water, I cannot survive.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, this water is obtained, and egotism is eradicated from within.<BR>
 O Nanak, I cannot live without Him, even for a moment; the True Guru has led me to meet Him. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 There are countless worlds and nether regions; I cannot calculate their number.<BR>
 You are the Creator, the Lord of the Universe; You create it, and You destroy it.<BR>
 The 8.4 million species of beings issued forth from You.<BR>
 Some are called kings, emperors and nobles.<BR>
 Some claim to be bankers and accumulate wealth, but in duality they lose their honor.<BR>
 Some are givers, and some are beggars; God is above the heads of all.<BR>
 Without the Name, they are vulgar, dreadful and wretched.<BR>
 Falsehood shall not last, O Nanak; whatever the True Lord does, comes to pass. ||12||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 O rainbird, the virtuous soul-bride attains the Mansion of her Lord's Presence; the unworthy, unvirtuous one is far away.<BR>
 Deep within your inner being, the Lord abides. The Gurmukh beholds Him ever-present.<BR>
 When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, the mortal no longer weeps and wails.<BR>
 O Nanak, those who are imbued with the Naam intuitively merge with the Lord; they practice the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 031</H2></CENTER>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 The rainbird prays: O Lord, grant Your Grace, and bless me with the gift of the life of the soul.<BR>
 Without the water, my thirst is not quenched, and my breath of life is ended and gone.<BR>
 You are the Giver of peace, O Infinite Lord God; You are the Giver of the treasure of virtue.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh is forgiven; in the end, the Lord God shall be your only friend. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 He created the world; He considers the merits and demerits of the mortals.<BR>
 Those who are entangled in the three gunas - the three dispositions - do not love the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Forsaking virtue, they practice evil; they shall be miserable in the Court of the Lord.<BR>
 They lose their life in the gamble; why did they even come into the world?<BR>
 But those who conquer and subdue their minds, through the True Word of the Shabad - night and day, they love the Naam.<BR>
 Those people enshrine the True, Invisible and Infinite Lord in their hearts.<BR>
 You, O Lord, are the Giver, the Treasure of virtue; I am unvirtuous and unworthy.<BR>
 He alone finds You, whom You bless and forgive, and inspire to contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||13||<BR>
 Shalok, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The faithless cynics forget the Name of the Lord; the night of their lives does not pass in peace.<BR>
 Their days and nights become comfortable, O Nanak, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 All sorts of jewels and gems, diamonds and rubies, shine forth from their foreheads.<BR>
 O Nanak, those who are pleasing to God, look beautiful in the Court of the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Serving the True Guru, I dwell on the True Lord.<BR>
 The work you have done for the True Guru shall be very useful in the end.<BR>
 The Messenger of Death cannot even touch that person who is protected by the True Lord.<BR>
 Lighting the lamp of the Guru's Teachings, my awareness has been awakened.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs are false; without the Name, they wander around like demons.<BR>
 They are nothing more than beasts, wrapped up in human skin; they are black-hearted within.<BR>
 The True Lord is pervading all; through the True Word of the Shabad, He is seen.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Naam is the greatest treasure. The Perfect Guru has revealed it to me. ||14||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The rainbird realizes the Hukam of the Lord's Command with intuitive ease through the Guru.<BR>
 The clouds mercifully burst forth, and the rain pours down in torrents.<BR>
 The cries and wailings of the rainbird have ceased, and peace has come to abide in its mind.<BR>
 O Nanak, praise that Lord, who reaches out and gives sustenance to all beings and creatures. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 O rainbird, you do not know what thirst is within you, or what you can drink to quench it.<BR>
 You wander in the love of duality, and you do not obtain the Ambrosial Water.<BR>
 When God casts His Glance of Grace, then the mortal automatically meets the True Guru.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Ambrosial Water is obtained from the True Guru, and then the mortal remains merged in the Lord with intuitive ease. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Some go and sit in the forest realms, and do not answer any calls.<BR>
 Some, in the dead of winter, break the ice and immerse themselves in freezing water.<BR>
 Some rub ashes on their bodies, and never wash off their dirt.<BR>
 Some look hideous, with their uncut hair matted and dishevelled. They bring dishonor to their family and ancestry.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 032</H2></CENTER>
 Some wander naked day and night and never sleep.<BR>
 Some burn their limbs in fire, damaging and ruining themselves.<BR>
 Without the Name, the body is reduced to ashes; what good is it to speak and cry then?<BR>
 Those who serve the True Guru, are embellished and exalted in the Court of their Lord and Master. ||15||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The rainbird chirps in the ambrosial hours of the morning before the dawn; its prayers are heard in the Court of the Lord.<BR>
 The order is issued to the clouds, to let the rains of mercy shower down.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to those who enshrine the True Lord within their hearts.<BR>
 O Nanak, through the Name, all are rejuvenated, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 O rainbird, this is not the way to quench your thirst, even though you may cry out a hundred times.<BR>
 By God's Grace, the True Guru is found; by His Grace, love wells up.<BR>
 O Nanak, when the Lord and Master abides in the mind, corruption and evil leave from within. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Some are Jains, wasting their time in the wilderness; by their pre-ordained destiny, they are ruined.<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is not on their lips; they do not bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage.<BR>
 They pull out their hair with their hands, instead of shaving.<BR>
 They remain unclean day and night; they do not love the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 They have no status, no honor, and no good karma. They waste away their lives in vain.<BR>
 Their minds are false and impure; that which they eat is impure and defiled.<BR>
 Without the Shabad, no one achieves a lifestyle of good conduct.<BR>
 The Gurmukh is absorbed in the True Lord God, the Universal Creator. ||16||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 In the month of Saawan, the bride is happy, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 O Nanak, she is a happy soul-bride forever; her love for the Guru is unlimited. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 In Saawan, she who has no virtue is burned, in attachment and love of duality.<BR>
 O Nanak, she does not appreciate the value of her Husband Lord; all her decorations are worthless. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The True, Unseen, Mysterious Lord is not won over by stubbornness.<BR>
 Some sing according to traditional ragas, but the Lord is not pleased by these ragas.<BR>
 Some dance and dance and keep the beat, but they do not worship Him with devotion.<BR>
 Some refuse to eat; what can be done with these fools?<BR>
 Thirst and desire have greatly increased; nothing brings satisfaction.<BR>
 Some are tied down by rituals; they hassle themselves to death.<BR>
 In this world, profit comes by drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam.<BR>
 The Gurmukhs gather in loving devotional worship of the Lord. ||17||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Those Gurmukhs who sing in the Raga of Malaar - their minds and bodies become cool and calm.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they realize the One, the One True Lord.<BR>
 Their minds and bodies are true; they obey the True Lord, and they are known as true.<BR>
 True devotional worship is deep within them; they are automatically blessed with honor.<BR>
 In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, there is utter darkness; the self-willed manmukh cannot find the way.<BR>
 O Nanak, very blessed are those Gurmukhs, unto whom the Lord is revealed. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 The clouds rain down mercifully, and joy wells up in the minds of the people.<BR>
 I am forever a sacrifice to the One, by whose Command the clouds burst forth with rain.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 033</H2></CENTER>
 The Gurmukhs dwell on the Word of the Shabad. They sing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord.<BR>
 O Nanak, those humble beings who are imbued with the Naam are pure and immaculate. They are intuitively merged in the True Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Serving the Perfect True Guru, I have found the Perfect Lord.<BR>
 Meditating on the Perfect Lord, by perfect karma, I have enshrined the Shabad within my mind.<BR>
 Through perfect spiritual wisdom and meditation, my filth has been washed away.<BR>
 The Lord is my sacred shrine of pilgrimage and pool of purification; I wash my mind in Him.<BR>
 One who dies in the Shabad and conquers his mind - blessed is the mother who gave birth to him.<BR>
 He is true in the Court of the Lord, and his coming into this world is judged to be true.<BR>
 No one can challenge that person, with whom our Lord and Master is pleased.<BR>
 O Nanak, praising the True Lord, his pre-ordained destiny is activated. ||18||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Those who give out ceremonial hats of recognition are fools; those who receive them have no shame.<BR>
 The mouse cannot enter its hole with a basket tied around its waist.<BR>
 Those who give out blessings shall die, and those that they bless shall also depart.<BR>
 O Nanak, no one knows the Lord's Command, by which all must depart.<BR>
 The spring harvest is the Name of the One Lord; the harvest of autumn is the True Name.<BR>
 I receive a letter of pardon from my Lord and Master, when I reach His Court.<BR>
 There are so many courts of the world, and so many who come and go there.<BR>
 There are so many beggars begging; so many beg and beg until death. ||1||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 The elephant eats a hundred pounds of ghee and molasses, and five hundred pounds of corn.<BR>
 He belches and grunts and scatters dust, and when the breath leaves his body, he regrets it.<BR>
 The blind and arrogant die insane.<BR>
 Submitting to the Lord, one become pleasing to Him.<BR>
 The sparrow eats only half a grain, then it flies through the sky and chirps.<BR>
 The good sparrow is pleasing to her Lord and Master, if she chirps the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 The powerful tiger kills hundreds of deer, and all sorts of other animals eat what it leaves.<BR>
 It becomes very strong, and cannot be contained in its den, but when it must go, it regrets.<BR>
 So who is impressed by the roar of the blind beast?<BR>
 He is not pleasing at all to his Lord and Master.<BR>
 The insect loves the milkweed plant; perched on its branch, it eats it.<BR>
 It becomes good and pleasing to its Lord and Master, if it chirps the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 O Nanak, the world lasts for only a few days; indulging in pleasures, pain is produced.<BR>
 There are many who boast and brag, but none of them can remain detached from the world.<BR>
 The fly dies for the sake of sweets.<BR>
 O Lord, death does not even approach those whom You protect. You carry them across the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 You are Inaccessible and Unfathomable, O Invisible and Infinite True Lord Master.<BR>
 You are the Giver, all are beggars of You. You alone are the Great Giver.<BR>
 Those who serve You find peace, reflecting on the Guru's Teachings.<BR>
 Some, according to Your Will, are in love with Maya.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, praise the Lord with love and affection within.<BR>
 Without love, there is no devotion. Without the True Guru, love is not enshrined.<BR>
 You are the Lord God; everyone serves You. This is the prayer of Your humble minstrel.<BR>
 Please bless me with the gift of contentment, that I may receive the True Name as my Support. ||19||<BR>

 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
 Through the night the time ticks away; through the day the time ticks away.<BR>
 The body wears away and turns to straw.<BR>
 All are involved and entangled in worldly entanglements.<BR>
 The mortal has mistakenly renounced the way of service.<BR>
 The blind fool is caught in conflict, bothered and bewildered.<BR>
 Those who weep after someone has died - can they bring him back to life?<BR>
 Without realization, nothing can be understood.<BR>
 The weepers who weep for the dead shall themselves die as well.<BR>
 O Nanak, this is the Will of our Lord and Master.<BR>
 Those who do not remember the Lord, are dead. ||1||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 Love dies, and affection dies; hatred and strife die.<BR>
 The color fades, and beauty vanishes; the body suffers and collapses.<BR>
 Where did he come from? Where is he going? Did he exist or not?<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh made empty boasts, indulging in parties and pleasures.<BR>
 O Nanak, without the True Name, his honor is torn away, from head to foot. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, is forever the Giver of peace. It shall be your Help and Support in the end.<BR>
 Without the Guru, the world is insane. It does not appreciate the worth of the Name.<BR>
 Those who serve the True Guru are accepted and approved. Their light merges into the Light.<BR>
 That servant who enshrines the Lord's Will within his mind, becomes just like his Lord and Master.<BR>
 Tell me, who has ever found peace by following his own will? The blind act in blindness.<BR>
 No one is ever satisfied and fulfilled by evil and corruption. The hunger of the fool is not satisfied.<BR>
 Attached to duality, all are ruined; without the True Guru, there is no understanding.<BR>
 Those who serve the True Guru find peace; they are blessed with Grace by the Will of the Lord. ||20||<BR>
 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
 Modesty and righteousness both, O Nanak, are qualities of those who are blessed with true wealth.<BR>
 Do not refer to that wealth as your friend, which leads you to get your head beaten.<BR>
 Those who possess only this worldly wealth are known as paupers.<BR>
 But those, within whose hearts You dwell, O Lord - those people are oceans of virtue. ||1||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 Worldly possessions are obtained by pain and suffering; when they are gone, they leave pain and suffering.<BR>
 O Nanak, without the True Name, hunger is never satisfied.<BR>
 Beauty does not satisfy hunger; when the man sees beauty, he hungers even more.<BR>
 As many as are the pleasures of the body, so many are the pains which afflict it. ||2||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 Acting blindly, the mind becomes blind. The blind mind makes the body blind.<BR>

 O Nanak, without the True Name, many multitudes have drowned. ||3||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 Thousands of pounds of gold, and thousands of pounds of silver; the king over the heads of thousands of kings.<BR>
 Thousands of armies, thousands of marching bands and spearmen; the emperor of thousands of horsemen.<BR>
 The unfathomable ocean of fire and water must be crossed.<BR>
 The other shore cannot be seen; only the roar of pitiful cries can be heard.<BR>
 O Nanak, there, it shall be known, whether anyone is a king or an emperor. ||4||<BR>

 By God's Command, it is ordained. When the mortal goes, he knows.<BR>
 Realize the Word of the Shabad, and cross over the terrifying world-ocean.<BR>
 Thieves, adulterers and gamblers are pressed like seeds in the mill.<BR>
 Slanderers and gossipers are hand-cuffed.<BR>
 The Gurmukh is absorbed in the True Lord, and is famous in the Court of the Lord. ||21||<BR>
 Shalok, Second Mehl:<BR>
 The beggar is known as an emperor, and the fool is known as a religious scholar.<BR>
 The blind man is known as a seer; this is how people talk.<BR>
 The trouble-maker is called a leader, and the liar is seated with honor.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukhs know that this is justice in the Dark Age of Kali Yuga. ||1||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 Deer, falcons and government officials are known to be trained and clever.<BR>
 When the trap is set, they trap their own kind; hereafter they will find no place of rest.<BR>
 He alone is learned and wise, and he alone is a scholar, who practices the Name.<BR>
 First, the tree puts down its roots, and then it spreads out its shade above.<BR>
 The kings are tigers, and their officials are dogs;<BR>
 they go out and awaken the sleeping people to harass them.<BR>
 The public servants inflict wounds with their nails.<BR>
 The dogs lick up the blood that is spilled.<BR>
 But there, in the Court of the Lord, all beings will be judged.<BR>
 Those who have violated the people's trust will be disgraced; their noses will be cut off. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 He Himself creates the world, and He himself takes care of it.<BR>
 Without the Fear of God, doubt is not dispelled, and love for the Name is not embraced.<BR>
 Through the True Guru, the Fear of God wells up, and the Door of Salvation is found.<BR>
 Through the Fear of God, intuitive ease is obtained, and one's light merges into the Light of the Infinite.<BR>
 Through the Fear of God, the terrifying world-ocean is crossed over, reflecting on the Guru's Teachings.<BR>
 Through the Fear of God, the Fearless Lord is found; He has no end or limitation.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs do not appreciate the value of the Fear of God. Burning in desire, they weep and wail.<BR>
 O Nanak, through the Name, peace is obtained, by enshrining the Guru's Teachings within the heart. ||22||<BR>
 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
 Beauty and sexual desire are friends; hunger and tasty food are tied together.<BR>
 Greed is bound up in its search for wealth, and sleep will use even a tiny space as a bed.<BR>
 Anger barks and brings ruin on itself, blindly pursuing useless conflicts.<BR>
 It is good to be silent, O Nanak; without the Name, one's mouth spews forth only filth. ||1||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 Royal power, wealth, beauty, social status and youth are the five thieves.<BR>
 These thieves have plundered the world; no one's honor has been spared.<BR>
 But these thieves themselves are robbed, by those who fall at the Guru's Feet.<BR>
 O Nanak, the multitudes who do not have good karma are plundered. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The learned and educated are called to account for their actions.<BR>
 Without the Name, they are judged false; they become miserable and suffer hardship.<BR>
 Their path becomes treacherous and difficult, and their way is blocked.<BR>
 Through the Shabad, the Word of the True and Independent Lord God, one becomes content.<BR>
 The Lord is deep and profound and unfathomable; His depth cannot be measured.<BR>
 Without the Guru, the mortals are beaten and punched in the face and the mouth, and no one is released.<BR>
 Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one returns to his true home with honor.<BR>
 Know that the Lord, by the Hukam of His Command, gives sustenance and the breath of life. ||23||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 036</H2></CENTER>
 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
 Living beings are formed of air, water and fire. They are subject to pleasure and pain.<BR>
 In this world, in the nether regions of the underworld, and in the Akaashic ethers of the heavens, some remain ministers in the Court of the Lord.<BR>
 Some live long lives, while others suffer and die.<BR>
 Some give and consume, and still their wealth is not exhausted, while others remain poor forever.<BR>
 In His Will He creates, and in His Will He destroys thousands in an instant.<BR>
 He has harnessed everyone with His harness; when He forgives, he breaks the harness.<BR>
 He has no color or features; He is invisible and beyond calculation.<BR>
 How can He be described? He is known as the Truest of the True.<BR>
 All the actions which are done and described, O Nanak, are done by the Indescribable Lord Himself.<BR>
 Whoever hears the description of the indescribable,<BR>
 is blessed with wealth, intelligence, perfection, spiritual wisdom and eternal peace. ||1||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 One who bears the unbearable, controls the nine holes of the body.<BR>
 One who worships and adores the Lord with his breath of life, gains stability in his body-wall.<BR>
 Where has he come from, and where will he go?<BR>
 Remaining dead while yet alive, he is accepted and approved.<BR>
 Whoever understands the Hukam of the Lord's Command, realizes the essence of reality.<BR>
 This is known by Guru's Grace.<BR>
 O Nanak, know this: egotism leads to bondage.<BR>
 Only those who have no ego and no self-conceit, are not consigned to reincarnation. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Read the Praise of the Lord's Name; other intellectual pursuits are false.<BR>
 Without dealing in Truth, life is worthless.<BR>
 No one has ever found the Lord's end or limitation.<BR>
 All the world is enveloped by the darkness of egotistical pride. It does not like the Truth.<BR>
 Those who depart from this world, forgetting the Naam, shall be roasted in the frying pan.<BR>
 They pour the oil of duality within, and burn.<BR>
 They come into the world and wander around aimlessly; they depart when the play is finished.<BR>
 O Nanak, imbued with Truth, the mortals merge in Truth. ||24||<BR>
 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
 First, the mortal is conceived in the flesh, and then he dwells in the flesh.<BR>
 When he comes alive, his mouth takes flesh; his bones, skin and body are flesh.<BR>
 He comes out of the womb of flesh, and takes a mouthful of flesh at the breast.<BR>
 His mouth is flesh, his tongue is flesh; his breath is in the flesh.<BR>
 He grows up and is married, and brings his wife of flesh into his home.<BR>
 Flesh is produced from flesh; all relatives are made of flesh.<BR>
 When the mortal meets the True Guru, and realizes the Hukam of the Lord's Command, then he comes to be reformed.<BR>
 Releasing himself, the mortal does not find release; O Nanak, through empty words, one is ruined. ||1||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 The fools argue about flesh and meat, but they know nothing about meditation and spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 What is called meat, and what is called green vegetables? What leads to sin?<BR>
 It was the habit of the gods to kill the rhinoceros, and make a feast of the burnt offering.<BR>
 Those who renounce meat, and hold their noses when sitting near it, devour men at night.<BR>
 They practice hypocrisy, and make a show before other people, but they do not understand anything about meditation or spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 O Nanak, what can be said to the blind people? They cannot answer, or even understand what is said.<BR>
 They alone are blind, who act blindly. They have no eyes in their hearts.<BR>
 They are produced from the blood of their mothers and fathers, but they do not eat fish or meat.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 037</H2></CENTER>
 But when men and women meet in the night, they come together in the flesh.<BR>
 In the flesh we are conceived, and in the flesh we are born; we are vessels of flesh.<BR>
 You know nothing of spiritual wisdom and meditation, even though you call yourself clever, O religious scholar.<BR>
 O master, you believe that flesh on the outside is bad, but the flesh of those in your own home is good.<BR>
 All beings and creatures are flesh; the soul has taken up its home in the flesh.<BR>
 They eat the uneatable; they reject and abandon what they could eat. They have a teacher who is blind.<BR>
 In the flesh we are conceived, and in the flesh we are born; we are vessels of flesh.<BR>
 You know nothing of spiritual wisdom and meditation, even though you call yourself clever, O religious scholar.<BR>
 Meat is allowed in the Puraanas, meat is allowed in the Bible and the Koran. Throughout the four ages, meat has been used.<BR>
 It is featured in sacred feasts and marriage festivities; meat is used in them.<BR>
 Women, men, kings and emperors originate from meat.<BR>
 If you see them going to hell, then do not accept charitable gifts from them.<BR>
 The giver goes to hell, while the receiver goes to heaven - look at this injustice.<BR>
 You do not understand your own self, but you preach to other people. O Pandit, you are very wise indeed.<BR>
 O Pandit, you do not know where meat originated.<BR>
 Corn, sugar cane and cotton are produced from water. The three worlds came from water.<BR>
 Water says, "I am good in many ways." But water takes many forms.<BR>
 Forsaking these delicacies, one becomes a true Sannyaasee, a detached hermit. Nanak reflects and speaks. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 What can I say with only one tongue? I cannot find your limits.<BR>
 Those who contemplate the True Word of the Shabad are absorbed into You, O Lord.<BR>
 Some wander around in saffron robes, but without the True Guru, no one finds the Lord.<BR>
 They wander in foreign lands and countries until they grow weary, but You hide Yourself within them.<BR>
 The Word of the Guru's Shabad is a jewel, through which the Lord shines forth and reveals Himself.<BR>
 Realizing one's own self, following the Guru's Teachings, the mortal is absorbed into Truth.<BR>
 Coming and going, the tricksters and magicians put on their magic show.<BR>
 But those whose minds are pleased by the True Lord, praise the True One, the Ever-stable Lord. ||25||<BR>
 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
 O Nanak, the tree of actions done in Maya yields ambrosial fruit and poisonous fruit.<BR>
 The Creator does all deeds; we eat the fruits as He ordains. ||1||<BR>
 Second Mehl:<BR>
 O Nanak, burn worldly greatness and glory in the fire.<BR>
 These burnt offerings have caused mortals to forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Not even one of them will go along with you in the end. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 He judges each and every being; by the Hukam of His Command, He leads us on.<BR>
 Justice is in Your Hands, O Lord; You are pleasing to my mind.<BR>
 The mortal is bound and gagged by Death and lead away; no one can rescue him.<BR>
 Old age, the tyrant, dances on the mortal's shoulders.<BR>
 So climb aboard the boat of the True Guru, and the True Lord will rescue you.<BR>
 The fire of desire burns like an oven, consuming mortals night and day.<BR>
 Like trapped birds, the mortals peck at the corn; only through the Lord's Command will they find release.<BR>
 Whatever the Creator does, comes to pass; falsehood shall fail in the end. ||26||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 038</H2></CENTER>
 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
 The True Guru is the All-knowing Primal Being; He shows us our true home within the home of the self.<BR>
 The Panch Shabad, the Five Primal Sounds, resonate and resound within; the insignia of the Shabad is revealed there, vibrating gloriously.<BR>
 Worlds and realms, nether regions, solar systems and galaxies are wondrously revealed.<BR>
 The strings and the harps vibrate and resound; the true throne of the Lord is there.<BR>
 Listen to the music of the home of the heart - Sukhmani, peace of mind. Lovingly tune in to His state of celestial ecstasy.<BR>
 Contemplate the Unspoken Speech, and the desires of the mind are dissolved.<BR>
 The heart-lotus is turned upside-down, and is filled with Ambrosial Nectar. This mind does not go out; it does not get distracted.<BR>
 It does not forget the Chant which is chanted without chanting; it is immersed in the Primal Lord God of the ages.<BR>
 All the sister-companions are blessed with the five virtues. The Gurmukhs dwell in the home of the self deep within.<BR>
 Nanak is the slave of that one who seeks the Shabad and finds this home within. ||1||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 The extravagant glamor of the world is a passing show.<BR>
 My twisted mind does not believe that it will end up in a grave.<BR>
 I am meek and lowly; You are the great river.<BR>
 Please, bless me with the one thing; everything else is poison, and does not tempt me.<BR>
 You filled this fragile body with the water of life, O Lord, by Your Creative Power.<BR>
 By Your Omnipotence, I have become powerful.<BR>
 Nanak is a dog in the Court of the Lord, intoxicated more and more, all the time.<BR>
 The world is on fire; the Name of the Lord is cooling and soothing. ||2||<BR>
 New Pauree, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 His wonderful play is all-pervading; it is wonderful and amazing!<BR>
 As Gurmukh, I know the the Transcendent Lord, the Supreme Lord God.<BR>
 All my sins and corruption are washed away, through the insignia of the Shabad, the Word of God.<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, one is saved, and becomes free.<BR>
 Meditating, meditating in remembrance on the Great Giver, I enjoy all comforts and pleasures.<BR>
 I have become famous throughout the world, under the canopy of His kindness and grace.<BR>
 He Himself has forgiven me, and united me with Himself; I am forever a sacrifice to Him.<BR>
 O Nanak, by the Pleasure of His Will, my Lord and Master has blended me with Himself. ||27||<BR>
 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
 Blessed is the paper, blessed is the pen, blessed is the inkwell, and blessed is the ink.<BR>
 Blessed is the writer, O Nanak, who writes the True Name. ||1||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 You Yourself are the writing tablet, and You Yourself are the pen. You are also what is written on it.<BR>
 Speak of the One Lord, O Nanak; how could there be any other? ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 You Yourself are all-pervading; You Yourself made the making.<BR>
 Without You, there is no other at all; You are permeating and pervading everywhere.<BR>
 You alone know Your state and extent. Only You can estimate Your worth.<BR>
 You are invisible, imperceptible and inaccessible. You are revealed through the Guru's Teachings.<BR>
 Deep within, there is ignorance, suffering and doubt; through the spiritual wisdom of the Guru, they are eradicated.<BR>
 He alone meditates on the Naam, whom You unite with Yourself, in Your Mercy.<BR>
 You are the Creator, the Inaccessible Primal Lord God; You are all-pervading everywhere.<BR>
 To whatever You link the mortal, O True Lord, to that he is linked. Nanak sings Your Glorious Praises. ||28||1||<BR>

 Raag Malaar, The Word Of The Devotee Naam Dayv Jee:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Serve the King, the Sovereign Lord of the World. He has no ancestry; He is immaculate and pure.<BR>
 Please bless me with the gift of devotion, which the humble Saints beg for. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 His Home is the pavilion seen in all directions; His ornamental heavenly realms fill the seven worlds alike.<BR>
 In His Home, the virgin Lakshmi dwells. The moon and the sun are His two lamps; the wretched Messenger of Death stages his dramas, and levies taxes on all.<BR>
 Such is my Sovereign Lord King, the Supreme Lord of all. ||1||<BR>
 In His House, the four-faced Brahma, the cosmic potter lives. He created the entire universe.<BR>
 In His House, the insane Shiva, the Guru of the World, lives; he imparts spiritual wisdom to expain the essence of reality.<BR>
 Sin and virtue are the standard-bearers at His Door; Chitr and Gupt are the recording angels of the conscious and subconscious.<BR>
 The Righteous Judge of Dharma, the Lord of Destruction, is the door-man.<BR>
 Such is the Supreme Sovereign Lord of the World. ||2||<BR>
 In His Home are the heavenly heralds, celestial singers, Rishis and poor minstrels, who sing so sweetly.<BR>
 All the Shaastras take various forms in His theater, singing beautiful songs.<BR>
 The wind waves the fly-brush over Him;<BR>
 His hand-maiden is Maya, who has conquered the world.<BR>
 The shell of the earth is His fireplace.<BR>
 Such is the Sovereign Lord of the three worlds. ||3||<BR>
 In His Home, the celestial turtle is the bed-frame, woven with the strings of the thousand-headed snake.<BR>
 His flower-girls are the eighteen loads of vegetation; His water-carriers are the nine hundred sixty million clouds.<BR>
 His sweat is the Ganges River.<BR>
 The seven seas are His water-pitchers.<BR>
 The creatures of the world are His household utensils.<BR>
 Such is the Sovereign Lord King of the three worlds. ||4||<BR>
 In His home are Arjuna, Dhroo, Prahlaad, Ambreek, Naarad, Nayjaa, the Siddhas and Buddhas, the ninety-two heavenly heralds and celestial singers in their wondrous play.<BR>
 All the creatures of the world are in His House.<BR>
 The Lord is diffused in the inner beings of all.<BR>
 Prays Naam Dayv, seek His Protection.<BR>
 All the devotees are His banner and insignia. ||5||1||<BR>
 MALAAR:<BR>
 Please do not forget me; please do not forget me,<BR>
 please do not forget me, O Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The temple priests have doubts about this, and everyone is furious with me.<BR>
 Calling me low-caste and untouchable, they beat me and drove me out; what should I do now, O Beloved Father Lord? ||1||<BR>
 If You liberate me after I am dead, no one will know that I am liberated.<BR>
 These Pandits, these religious scholars, call me low-born; when they say this, they tarnish Your honor as well. ||2||<BR>
 You are called kind and compassionate; the power of Your Arm is absolutely unrivalled.<BR>
 The Lord turned the temple around to face Naam Dayv; He turned His back on the Brahmins. ||3||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 31 - Raag Malaar - Part 040</H2></CENTER>
 Malaar, The Word Of The Devotee Ravi Daas Jee:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 O humble townspeople, I am obviously just a shoemaker.<BR>
 In my heart I cherish the Glories of the Lord, the Lord of the Universe. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Even if wine is made from the water of the Ganges, O Saints, do not drink it.<BR>
 This wine, and any other polluted water which mixes with the Ganges, is not separate from it. ||1||<BR>
 The palmyra palm tree is considered impure, and so its leaves are considered impure as well.<BR>
 But if devotional prayers are written on paper made from its leaves, then people bow in reverence and worship before it. ||2||<BR>
 It is my occupation to prepare and cut leather; each day, I carry the carcasses out of the city.<BR>
 Now, the important Brahmins of the city bow down before me; Ravi Daas, Your slave, seeks the Sanctuary of Your Name. ||3||1||<BR>
 MALAAR:<BR>
 Those humble beings who meditate on the Lord's Lotus Feet - none are equal to them.<BR>
 The Lord is One, but He is diffused in many forms. Bring in, bring in, that All-pervading Lord. ||Pause||<BR>
 He who writes the Praises of the Lord God, and sees nothing else at all, is a low-class, untouchable fabric-dyer by trade.<BR>
 The Glory of the Name is seen in the writings of Vyaas and Sanak, throughout the seven continents. ||1||<BR>
 And he whose family used to kill cows at the festivals of Eed and Bakareed, who worshipped Shayks, martyrs and spiritual teachers,<BR>
 whose father used to do such things - his son Kabeer became so successful that he is now famous throughout the three worlds. ||2||<BR>
 And all the leather-workers in those families still go around Benares removing the dead cattle<BR>
 - the ritualistic Brahmins bow in reverence before their son Ravi Daas, the slave of the Lord's slaves. ||3||2||<BR>
 Malaar:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 What sort of devotional worship will lead me to meet my Beloved, the Lord of my breath of life?<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I have obtained the supreme status. ||Pause||<BR>
 How long shall I wash these dirty clothes?<BR>
 How long shall I remain asleep? ||1||<BR>
 Whatever I was attached to, has perished.<BR>
 The shop of false merchandise has closed down. ||2||<BR>
 Says Ravi Daas, when the account is called for and given,<BR>
 whatever the mortal has done, he shall see. ||3||1||3||<BR>
