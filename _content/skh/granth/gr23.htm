<CENTER><H2>Section 23 - Raag Nat Naaraayan - Part 001</H2></CENTER>
 Raag Nat Naaraayan, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<BR>
 O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, day and night.<BR>
 Millions and millions of sins and mistakes, committed through countless lifetimes, shall all be put aside and sent away. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Those who chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and worship Him in adoration, and serve Him with love, are genuine.<BR>
 All their sins are erased, just as water washes off the dirt. ||1||<BR>
 That being, who sings the Lord's Praises each and every instant, chants with his mouth the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 In a moment, in an instant, the Lord rids him of the five incurable diseases of the body-village. ||2||<BR>
 Very fortunate are those who meditate on the Lord's Name; they alone are the Lord's devotees.<BR>
 I beg for the Sangat, the Congregation; O God, please bless me with them. I am a fool, and an idiot - please save me! ||3||<BR>
 Shower me with Your Mercy and Grace, O Life of the World; save me, I seek Your Sanctuary.<BR>
 Servant Nanak has entered Your Sanctuary; O Lord, please preserve my honor! ||4||1||<BR>
 Nat, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 Meditating on the Lord, His humble servants are blended with the Lord's Name.<BR>
 Chanting the Lord's Name, following the Guru's Teachings, the Lord showers His Mercy upon them. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Our Lord and Master, Har, Har, is inaccessible and unfathomable. Meditating on Him, His humble servant merges with Him, like water with water.<BR>
 Meeting with the Lord's Saints, I have obtained the sublime essence of the Lord. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to His humble servants. ||1||<BR>
 The Lord's humble servant sings the Praises of the Name of the Supreme, Primal Soul, and all poverty and pain are destroyed.<BR>
 Within the body are the five evil and uncontrollable passions. The Lord destroys them in an instant. ||2||<BR>
 The Lord's Saint loves the Lord in his mind, like the lotus flower gazing at the moon.<BR>
 The clouds hang low, the clouds tremble with thunder, and the mind dances joyfully like the peacock. ||3||<BR>
 My Lord and Master has placed this yearning within me; I live by seeing and meeting my Lord.<BR>
 Servant Nanak is addicted to the intoxication of the Lord; meeting with the Lord, he finds sublime bliss. ||4||2||<BR>
 Nat, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, your only Friend.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 23 - Raag Nat Naaraayan - Part 002</H2></CENTER>
 By Guru's Grace, I meditate on the Name of the Lord; I wash the Feet of the True Guru. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Exalted Lord of the World, the Master of the Universe, keeps a sinner like me in His Sanctuary<BR>
 You are the Greatest Being, Lord, Destroyer of the pains of the meek; You have placed Your Name in my mouth, Lord. ||1||<BR>
 I am lowly, but I sing the Lofty Praises of the Lord, meeting with the Guru, the True Guru, my Friend.<BR>
 Like the bitter nimm tree, growing near the sandalwood tree, I am permeated with the fragrance of sandalwood. ||2||<BR>
 My faults and sins of corruption are countless; over and over again, I commit them.<BR>
 I am unworthy, I am a heavy stone sinking down; but the Lord has carried me across, in association with His humble servants. ||3||<BR>
 Those whom You save, Lord - all their sins are destroyed.<BR>
 O Merciful God, Lord and Master of servant Nanak, You have carried across even evil villains like Harnaakhash. ||4||3||<BR>
 Nat, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, with love.<BR>
 When the Lord of the Universe, Har, Har, granted His Grace, then I fell at the feet of the humble, and I meditate on the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Mistaken and confused for so many past lives, I have now come and entered the Sanctuary of God.<BR>
 O my Lord and Master, You are the Cherisher of those who come to Your Sanctuary. I am such a great sinner - please save me! ||1||<BR>
 Associating with You, Lord, who would not be saved? Only God sanctifies the sinners.<BR>
 Naam Dayv, the calico printer, was driven out by the evil villains, as he sang Your Glorious Praises; O God, You protected the honor of Your humble servant. ||2||<BR>
 Those who sing Your Glorious Praises, O my Lord and Master - I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice to them.<BR>
 Those houses and homes are sanctified, upon which the dust of the feet of the humble settles. ||3||<BR>
 I cannot describe Your Glorious Virtues, God; You are the greatest of the great, O Great Primal Lord God.<BR>
 Please shower Your Mercy upon servant Nanak, God; I serve at the feet of Yor humble servants. ||4||4||<BR>
 Nat, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 O my mind, believe in and chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 God, the Master of the Universe, has showered His Mercy upon me, and through the Guru's Teachings, my intellect has been molded by the Naam. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Lord's humble servant sings the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, listening to the Guru's Teachings.<BR>
 The Lord's Name cuts down all sins, like the farmer cutting down his crops. ||1||<BR>
 You alone know Your Praises, God; I cannot even describe Your Glorious Virtues, Lord.<BR>
 You are what You are, God; You alone know Your Glorious Virtues, God. ||2||<BR>
 The mortals are bound by the many bonds of Maya's noose. Meditating on the Lord, the knot is untied,<BR>
 like the elephant, which was caught in the water by the crococile; it remembered the Lord, and chanted the Lord's Name, and was released. ||3||<BR>
 O my Lord and Master, Supreme Lord God, Transcendent Lord, throughout the ages, mortals search for You.<BR>
 Your extent cannot be estimated or known, O Great God of servant Nanak. ||4||5||<BR>
 Nat, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 O my mind, in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises is worthy and commendable.<BR>
 When the Merciful Lord God shows kindness and compassion, then one falls at the feet of the True Guru, and meditates on the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 23 - Raag Nat Naaraayan - Part 003</H2></CENTER>
 O my Lord and Master, You are great, inaccessible and unfathomable; all meditate on You, O Beautiful Lord.<BR>
 Those whom You view with Your Great Eye of Grace, meditate on You, Lord, and become Gurmukh. ||1||<BR>
 The expanse of this creation is Your work, O God, my Lord and Master, Life of the entire universe, united with all.<BR>
 Countless waves rise up from the water, and then they merge into the water again. ||2||<BR>
 You alone, God, know whatever You do. O Lord, I do not know.<BR>
 I am Your child; please enshrine Your Praises within my heart, God, so that I may remember You in meditation. ||3||<BR>
 You are the treasure of water, O Lord, the Maansarovar Lake. Whoever serves You receives all fruitful rewards.<BR>
 Servant Nanak longs for the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har; bless him, Lord, with Your Mercy. ||4||6||<BR>
 Nat Naaraayan, Fourth Mehl, Partaal:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 O my mind, serve the Lord, and receive the fruits of your rewards.<BR>
 Receive the dust of the Guru's feet.<BR>
 All poverty will be eliminated, and your pains will disappear.<BR>
 The Lord shall bless you with His Glance of Grace, and you shall be enraptured. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Lord Himself embellishes His household. The Lord's Mansion of Love is studded with countless jewels, the jewels of the Beloved Lord.<BR>
 The Lord Himself has granted His Grace, and He has come into my home.The Guru is my advocate before the Lord. Gazing upon the Lord, I have become blissful, blissful, blissful. ||1||<BR>
 From the Guru, I received news of the Lord's arrival. My mind and body became ecstatic and blissful, hearing of the arrival of the Lord, my Beloved Love, my Lord.<BR>
 Servant Nanak has met with the Lord, Har, Har; he is intoxicated, enraptured, enraptured. ||2||1||7||<BR>
 Nat, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 O mind, join the Society of the Saints, and become noble and exalted.<BR>
 Listen to the Unspoken Speech of the peace-giving Lord.<BR>
 All sins will be washed away.<BR>
 Meet with the Lord, according to your pre-ordained destiny. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Kirtan of the Lord's Praise is lofty and exalted. Following the Guru's Teachings, the intellect dwells on the sermon of the Lord.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to that person who listens and believes. ||1||<BR>
 One who tastes the sublime essence of the Unspoken Speech of the Lord - all his hunger is satisfied.<BR>
 Servant Nanak listens to the sermon of the Lord, and is satisfied; chanting the Lord's Name, Har, Har, Har, he has become like the Lord. ||2||2||8||<BR>
 Nat, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 If only someone would come and tell me the Lord's sermon.<BR>
 I would be a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice to him.<BR>
 That humble servant of the Lord is the best of the best.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 23 - Raag Nat Naaraayan - Part 004</H2></CENTER>
 Meeting with the Lord, you be enraptured. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Guru, the Saint, has shown me the Lord's Path. The Guru has shown me the way to walk on the Lord's Path.<BR>
 Cast out deception from within yourself, O my Gursikhs, and without deception, serve the Lord. You shall be enraptured, enraptured, enraptured. ||1||<BR>
 Those Sikhs of the Guru, who realize that my Lord God is with them, are pleasing to my Lord God.<BR>
 The Lord God has blessed servant Nanak with understanding; seeing his Lord hear at hand, his is enraptured, enraptured, enraptured, enraptured. ||2||3||9||<BR>
 Raag Nat Naaraayan, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 O Lord, how can I know what pleases You?<BR>
 Within my mind is such a great thirst for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He alone is a spiritual teacher, and he alone is Your humble servant, to whom You have given Your approval.<BR>
 He alone meditates on You forever and ever, O Primal Lord, O Architect of Destiny, unto whom You grant Your Grace. ||1||<BR>
 What sort of Yoga, what spiritual wisdom and meditation, and what virtues please You?<BR>
 He alone is a humble servant, and he alone is God's own devotee, with whom You are in love. ||2||<BR>
 That alone is intelligence, that alone is wisdom and cleverness, which inspires one to never forget God, even for an instant.<BR>
 Joining the Society of the Saints, I have found this peace, singing forever the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 I have seen the Wondrous Lord, the embodiment of supreme bliss, and now, I see nothing else at all.<BR>
 Says Nanak, the Guru has rubbed sway the rust; now how could I ever enter the womb of reincarnation again? ||4||1||<BR>
 Raag Nat Naaraayan, Fifth Mehl, Du-Padas:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 I don't blame anyone else.<BR>
 Whatever You do is sweet to my mind. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Understanding and obeying Your Order, I have found peace; hearing, listening to Your Name, I live.<BR>
 Here and hereafter, O Lord, You, only You. The Guru has implanted this Mantra within me. ||1||<BR>
 Since I came to realize this, I have been blessed with total peace and pleasure.<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, this has been revealed to Nanak, and now, there is no other for him at all. ||2||1||2||<BR>
 Nat, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Whoever has You for support,<BR>
 has the fear of death removed; peace is found, and the disease of egotism is taken away. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The fire within is quenched, and one is satisfied through the Ambrosial Word of the Guru's Bani, as the baby is satisfied by milk.<BR>
 The Saints are my mother, father and friends. The Saints are my help and support, and my brothers. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 23 - Raag Nat Naaraayan - Part 005</H2></CENTER>
 The doors of doubt are thrown open, and I have met the Lord of the World; God's diamond has pierced the diamond of my mind.<BR>
 Nanak blossoms forth in ecstasy, singing the Lord's Praises; my Lord and Master is the ocean of virtue. ||2||2||3||<BR>
 Nat, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 He Himself saves His humble servant.<BR>
 Twenty-four hours a day, He dwells with His humble servant; He never forgets him from His Mind. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Lord does not look at his color or form; He does not consider the ancestry of His slave.<BR>
 Granting His Grace, the Lord blesses him with His Name, and embellishes him with intuitive ease. ||1||<BR>
 The ocean of fire is treacherous and difficult, but he is carried across.<BR>
 Seeing, seeing Him, Nanak blossoms forth, over and over again, a sacrifice to Him. ||2||3||4||<BR>
 Nat, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One who chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, within his mind<BR>
 - millions of sins are erased in an instant, and pain is relieved. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Seeking and searching, I have become detached; I have found the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<BR>
 Renouncing everything, I am lovingly focused on the One Lord. I grab hold of the feet of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||<BR>
 Whoever chants His Name is liberated; whoever listens to it is saved, as is anyone who seeks His Sanctuary.<BR>
 Meditating, meditating in remembrance on God the Lord and Master, says Nanak, I am in ecstasy! ||2||4||5||<BR>
 Nat, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I am in love with Your Lotus Feet.<BR>
 O Lord, ocean of peace, please bless me with the supreme status. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He has inspired His humble servant to grasp the hem of His robe; his mind is pierced through with the intoxication of divine love.<BR>
 Singing His Praises, love wells up within the devotee, and the trap of Maya is broken. ||1||<BR>
 The Lord, the ocean of mercy, is all-pervading, permeating everywhere; I do not see any other at all.<BR>
 He has united slave Nanak with Himself; His Love never diminishes. ||2||5||6||<BR>
 Nat, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 O my mind, chant, and meditate on the Lord.<BR>
 I shall never forget Him from my mind; twenty-four hours a day, I sing His Glorious Praises. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I take my daily cleansing bath in the dust of the feet of the Holy, and I am rid of all my sins.<BR>
 The Lord, the ocean of mercy, is all-pervading, permeating everywhere; He is seen to be contained in each and every heart. ||1||<BR>
 Hundreds of thousands and millions of meditations, austerities and worships are not equal to remembering the Lord in meditation.<BR>
 With his palms pressed together, Nanak begs for this blessing, that he may become the slave of the slaves of Your slaves. ||2||6||7||<BR>
 Nat, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is everything for me.<BR>
 Granting His Grace, He has led me to join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; the True Guru has granted this gift. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Sing the Kirtan, the Praises of the Lord, the Giver of peace, the Destroyer of pain; He shall bless you with perfect spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 Sexual desire, anger and greed shall be shattered and destroyed, and your foolish ego will be dispelled. ||1||<BR>
 What Glorious Virtues of Yours should I chant? O God, You are the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.<BR>
 I seek the Sanctuary of Your Lotus Feet, O Lord, ocean of peace; Nanak is forever a sacrifice to You. ||2||7||8||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 23 - Raag Nat Naaraayan - Part 006</H2></CENTER>
 Nat, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Guru, the Lord of the World. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I am unworthy; You are the Perfect Giver. You are the Merciful Master of the meek. ||1||<BR>
 While standing up and sitting down, while sleeping and awake, You are my soul, my breath of life, my wealth and property. ||2||<BR>
 Within my mind there is such a great thirst for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. Nanak is enraptured with Your Glance of Grace. ||3||8||9||<BR>
 Nat Partaal, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Is there any friend or companion of mine,<BR>
 who will constantly share the Lord's Name with me?<BR>
 Will he rid me of my pains and evil tendencies?<BR>
 I would surrender my mind, body, consciousness and everything. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 How rare is that one whom the Lord makes His own,<BR>
 and whose mind is sewn into the Lord's Lotus Feet.<BR>
 Granting His Grace, the Lord blesses him with His Praise. ||1||<BR>
 Vibrating, meditating on the Lord, he is victorious in this precious human life,<BR>
 and millions of sinners are sanctified.<BR>
 Slave Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to Him. ||2||1||10||19||<BR>
 Nat Ashtapadees, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 O Lord, Your Name is the support of my mind and body.<BR>
 I cannot survive for a moment, even for an instant, without serving You. Following the Guru's Teachings, I dwell upon the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Within my mind, I meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har, Har. The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is so dear to me.<BR>
 When God, my Lord and Master, became merciful to me the meek one, I was exalted by the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||<BR>
 Almighty Lord, Slayer of demons, Life of the World, my Lord and Master, inaccessible and infinite:<BR>
 I offer this one prayer to the Guru, to bless me, that I may wash the feet of the Holy. ||2||<BR>
 The thousands of eyes are the eyes of God; the One God, the Primal Being, remains unattached.<BR>
 The One God, our Lord and Master, has thousands of forms; God alone, through the Guru's Teachings, saves us. ||3||<BR>
 Following the Guru's Teachings, I have been blessed with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. I have enshrined within my heart the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 The sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, is so very sweet; like the mute, I taste its sweetness, but I cannot describe it at all. ||4||<BR>
 The tongue savors the bland, insipid taste of the love of duality, greed and corruption.<BR>
 The Gurmukh tastes the flavor of the Lord's Name, and all other tastes and flavors are forgotten. ||5||<BR>
 Following the Guru's Teachings, I have obtained the wealth of the Lord's Name; hearing it, and chanting it, sins are eradicated.<BR>
 The Messenger of Death and the Righteous Judge of Dharma do not even approach the beloved servant of my Lord and Master. ||6||<BR>
 With as many breaths as I have, I chant the Naam, under Guru's Instructions.<BR>
 Each and every breath which escapes me without the Naam - that breath is useless and corrupt. ||7||<BR>
 Please grant Your Grace; I am meek; I seek Your Sanctuary, God. Unite me with Your beloved, humble servants.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 23 - Raag Nat Naaraayan - Part 007</H2></CENTER>
 Nanak, the slave of Your slaves, says, I am the water-carrier of Your slaves. ||8||1||<BR>
 Nat, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 O Lord, I am an unworthy stone.<BR>
 The Merciful Lord, in His Mercy, has led me to meet the Guru; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, this stone is carried across. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The True Guru has implanted within me the exceedingly sweet Naam, the Name of the Lord; it is like the most fragrant sandalwood.<BR>
 Through the Name, my awareness extends in the ten directions; the fragrance of the fragrant Lord permeates the air. ||1||<BR>
 Your unlimited sermon is the most sweet sermon; I contemplate the most Sublime Word of the Guru.<BR>
 Singing, singing, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; singing His Glorious Praises, the Guru saves me. ||2||<BR>
 The Guru is wise and clear; the Guru looks upon all alike. Meeting with Him, doubt and skepticism are removed.<BR>
 Meeting with the True Guru, I have obtained the supreme status. I am a sacrifice to the True Guru. ||3||<BR>
 Practicing hypocrisy and deception, people wander around in confusion. Greed and hypocrisy are evils in this world.<BR>
 In this world and the next, they are miserable; the Messenger of Death hovers over their heads, and strikes them down. ||4||<BR>
 At the break of day, they take care of their affairs, and the poisonous entanglements of Maya.<BR>
 When night falls, they enter the land of dreams, and even in dreams, they take care of their corruptions and pains. ||5||<BR>
 Taking a barren field, they plant falsehood; they shall harvest only falsehood.<BR>
 The materialistic people shall all remain hungry; the brutal Messenger of Death stands waiting at their door. ||6||<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh has accumulated a tremendous load of debt in sin; only by contemplating the Word of the Shabad, can this debt be paid off.<BR>
 As much debt and as many creditors as there are, the Lord makes them into servants, who fall at his feet. ||7||<BR>
 All the beings which the Lord of the Universe created - He puts the rings through their noses, and leads them all along.<BR>
 O Nanak, as God drives us on, so do we follow; it is all the Will of the Beloved Lord. ||8||2||<BR>
 Nat, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 The Lord has bathed me in the pool of Ambrosial Nectar.<BR>
 The spiritual wisdom of the True Guru is the most excellent cleansing bath; bathing in it, all the filthy sins are washed away. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The virtues of the Sangat, the Holy Congregation, are so very great. Even the prostitute was saved, by teaching the parrot to speak the Lord's Name.<BR>
 Krishna was pleased, and so he touched the hunch-back Kubija, and she was transported to the heavens. ||1||<BR>
 Ajaamal loved his son Naaraayan, and called out his name.<BR>
 His loving devotion pleased my Lord and Master, who struck down and drove off the Messengers of Death. ||2||<BR>
 The mortal speaks and by speaking, makes the people listen; but he does not reflect upon what he himself says.<BR>
 But when he joins the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, he is confirmed in his faith, and he is saved by the Name of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 As long as his soul and body are healthy and strong, he does not remember the Lord at all.<BR>
 But when his home and mansion catch fire, then, he wants to dig the well to draw water. ||4||<BR>
 O mind, do not join with the faithless cynic, who has forgotten the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 The word of the faithless cynic stings like a scorpion; leave the faithless cynic far, far behind. ||5||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 23 - Raag Nat Naaraayan - Part 008</H2></CENTER>
 Fall in love, fall deeply in love with the Lord; clinging to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you will be exalted and embellished.<BR>
 Those who accept the Word of the Guru as True, totally True, are very dear to my Lord and Master. ||6||<BR>
 Because of actions committed in past lives, one comes to love the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, you shall obtain the ambrosial essence; sing of this essence, and reflect upon this essence. ||7||<BR>
 O Lord, Har, Har, all forms and colors are Yours; O my Beloved, my deep crimson ruby.<BR>
 Only that color which You impart, Lord, exists; O Nanak, what can the poor wretched being do? ||8||3||<BR>
 Nat, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 In the Sanctuary of the Guru, the Lord God saves and protects us,<BR>
 as He protected the elephant, when the crocodile seized it and pulled it into the water; He lifted him up and pulled him out. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 God's servants are sublime and exalted; they enshrine faith for Him in their minds.<BR>
 Faith and devotion are pleasing to my God's Mind; He saves the honor of His humble servants. ||1||<BR>
 The servant of the Lord, Har, Har, is committed to His service; He sees God pervading the entire expanse of the universe.<BR>
 He sees the One and only Primal Lord God, who blesses all with His Glance of Grace. ||2||<BR>
 God, our Lord and Master, is permeating and pervading all places; He takes care of the whole world as His slave.<BR>
 The Merciful Lord Himself mercifully gives His gifts, even to worms in stones. ||3||<BR>
 Within the deer is the heavy fragrance of musk, but he is confused and deluded, and he shakes his horns looking for it.<BR>
 Wandering, rambling and roaming through the forests and woods, I exhausted myself, and then in my own home, the Perfect Guru saved me. ||4||<BR>
 The Word, the Bani is Guru, and Guru is the Bani. Within the Bani, the Ambrosial Nectar is contained.<BR>
 If His humble servant believes, and acts according to the Words of the Guru's Bani, then the Guru, in person, emancipates him. ||5||<BR>
 All is God, and God is the whole expanse; man eats what he has planted.<BR>
 When Dhrishtabudhi tormented the humble devotee Chandrahaans, he only set his own house on fire. ||6||<BR>
 God's humble servant longs for Him within his heart; God watches over each breath of His humble servant.<BR>
 Mercifully, mercifully, He implants devotion within his humble servant; for his sake, God saves the whole world. ||7||<BR>
 God, our Lord and Master, is Himself by Himself; God Himself embellishes the universe.<BR>
 O servant Nanak, He Himself is all-pervading; in His Mercy, He Himself emancipates all. ||8||4||<BR>
 Nat, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 Grant Your Grace, Lord, and save me,<BR>
 as You saved Dropadi from shame when she was seized and brought before the court by the evil villians. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Bless me with Your Grace - I am just a humble beggar of Yours; I beg for a single blessing, O my Beloved.<BR>
 I long constantly for the True Guru. Lead me to meet the Guru, O Lord, that I may be exalted and embellished. ||1||<BR>
 The actions of the faithless cynic are like the churning of water; he churns, constantly churning only water.<BR>
 Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, the supreme status is obtained; the butter is produced, and eaten with delight. ||2||<BR>
 He may constantly and continually wash his body; he may constantly rub, clean and polish his body.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 23 - Raag Nat Naaraayan - Part 009</H2></CENTER>
 But if the Word of my True Guru is not pleasing to his mind, then all his preparations and beautiful decorations are useless. ||3||<BR>
 Walk playfully and carefree, O my friends and companions; cherish the Glorious Virtues of my Lord and Master.<BR>
 To serve, as Gurmukh, is pleasing to my God. Through the True Guru, the unknown is known. ||4||<BR>
 Women and men, all the men and women, all came from the One Primal Lord God.<BR>
 My mind loves the dust of the feet of the humble; the Lord emancipates those who meet with the Lord's humble servants. ||5||<BR>
 From village to village, throughout all the cities I wandered; and then, inspired by the Lord's humble servants, I found Him deep within the nucleus of my heart.<BR>
 Faith and longing have welled up within me, and I have been blended with the Lord; the Guru, the Guru, has saved me. ||6||<BR>
 The thread of my breath has been made totally sublime and pure; I contemplate the Shabad, the Word of the True Guru.<BR>
 I came back to the home of my own inner self; drinking in the ambrosial essence, I see the world, without my eyes. ||7||<BR>
 I cannot describe Your Glorious Virtues, Lord; You are the temple, and I am just a tiny worm.<BR>
 Bless Nanak with Your Mercy, and unite him with the Guru; meditating on my Lord, my mind is comforted and consoled. ||8||5||<BR>
 Nat, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 O my mind, vibrate, meditate on the inaccessible and infinite Lord and Master.<BR>
 I am such a great sinner; I am so unworthy. And yet the Guru, in His Mercy, has saved me. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I have found the Holy Person, the Holy and humble servant of the Lord; I offer a prayer to Him, my Beloved Guru.<BR>
 Please, bless me with the wealth, the capital of the Lord's Name, and take away all my hunger and thirst. ||1||<BR>
 The moth, the deer, the bumble bee, the elephant and the fish are ruined, each by the one passion that controls them.<BR>
 The five powerful demons are in the body; the Guru, the True Guru turns out these sins. ||2||<BR>
 I searched and searched through the Shaastras and the Vedas; Naarad the silent sage proclaimed these words as well.<BR>
 Chanting the Lord's Name, salvation is attained; the Guru saves those in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. ||3||<BR>
 In love with the Beloved Lord God, one looks at Him as the lotus looks at the sun.<BR>
 The peacock dances on the mountain, when the clouds hang low and heavy. ||4||<BR>
 The faithless cyinc may be totally drenched with ambrosial nectar, but even so, all his branches and flowers are filled with venom.<BR>
