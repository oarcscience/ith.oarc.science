<CENTER><H2>Section 37 - Fifth Mehl, Gaat'haa - Part 001</H2></CENTER>
 Associating with the Brahmin, one is saved, if his actions are perfect and God-like.<BR>
 Those whose souls are imbued with the world - O Nanak, their lives are fruitless. ||65||<BR>
 The mortal steals the wealth of others, and makes all sorts of problems; his preaching is only for his own livelihood.<BR>
 His desire for this and that is not satisfied; his mind is caught in Maya, and he is acting like a pig. ||66||<BR>
 Those who are intoxicated and absorbed in the Lord's Lotus Feet are saved from the terrifying world-ocean.<BR>
 Countless sins are destroyed, O Nanak, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; there is no doubt about this. ||67||4||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl, Gaat'haa:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Camphor, flowers and perfume become contaminated, by coming into contact with the human body.<BR>
 O Nanak, the ignorant one is proud of his foul-smelling marrow, blood and bones. ||1||<BR>
 Even if the mortal could reduce himself to the size of an atom, and shoot through the ethers, worlds and realms in the blink of an eye, O Nanak, without the Holy Saint, he shall not be saved. ||2||<BR>
 Know for sure that death will come; whatever is seen is false.<BR>
 So chant the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; this alone shall go along with you in the end. ||3||<BR>
 The consciousness wanders lost in Maya, attached to friends and relatives.<BR>
 Vibrating and meditating on the Lord of the Universe in the Saadh Sangat, O Nanak, the eternal place of rest is found. ||4||<BR>
 The lowly nim tree, growing near the sandalwood tree, becomes just like the sandalwood tree.<BR>
 But the bamboo tree, also growing near it, does not pick up its fragrance; it is too tall and proud. ||5||<BR>
 In this Gaat'haa, the Lord's Sermon is woven; listening to it, pride is crushed.<BR>
 The five enemies are killed, O Nanak, by shooting the Arrow of the Lord. ||6||<BR>
 The Words of the Holy are the path of peace. They are obtained by good karma.<BR>
 The cycle of birth and death is ended, O Nanak, singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises. ||7||<BR>
 When the leaves wither and fall, they cannot be attached to the branch again.<BR>
 Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, O Nanak, there is misery and suffering. The mortal wanders in reincarnation day and night. ||8||<BR>
 One is blessed with love for the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, by great good fortune.<BR>
 Whoever sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name, O Nanak, is not affected by the world-ocean. ||9||<BR>
 This Gaat'haa is profound and infinite; how rare are those who understand it.<BR>
 They forsake sexual desire and worldly love, O Nanak, and praise the Lord in the Saadh Sangat. ||10||<BR>
 The Words of the Holy are the most sublime Mantra. They eradicate millions of sinful mistakes.<BR>
 Meditating on the Lotus Feet of the Lord, O Nanak, all one's generations are saved. ||11||<BR>
 That palace is beautiful, in which the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises are sung.<BR>
 Those who dwell on the Lord of the Universe are liberated. O Nanak, only the most fortunate are so blessed. ||12||<BR>
 I have found the Lord, my Friend, my very Best Friend.<BR>
 He shall never break my heart.<BR>
 His dwelling is eternal; His weight cannot be weighed.<BR>
 Nanak has made Him the Friend of his soul. ||13||<BR>
 One's bad reputation is erased by a true son,<BR>
 who meditates in his heart on the Guru's Mantra.<BR>
