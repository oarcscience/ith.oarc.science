<HR><CENTER><H1>Shri Guru Granth Sahib: Raag Sorat'h</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 001</H2></CENTER>
 One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<BR>
 Sorat'h, First Mehl, First House, Chau-Padas:<BR>
 Death comes to all, and all must suffer separation.<BR>
 Go and ask the clever people, whether they shall meet in the world hereafter.<BR>
 Those who forget my Lord and Master shall suffer in terrible pain. ||1||<BR>
 So praise the True Lord,<BR>
 by whose Grace peace ever prevails. ||Pause||<BR>
 Praise Him as great; He is, and He shall ever be.<BR>
 You alone are the Great Giver; mankind cannot give anything.<BR>
 Whatever pleases Him, comes to pass; what good does it do to cry out in protest? ||2||<BR>
 Many have proclaimed their sovereignty over millions of fortresses on the earth, but they have now departed.<BR>
 And those, whom even the sky could not contain, had ropes put through their noses.<BR>
 O mind, if you only knew the torment in your future, you would not relish the sweet pleasures of the present. ||3||<BR>
 O Nanak, as many as are the sins one commits, so many are the chains around his neck.<BR>
 If he possesses virtues, then the chains are cut away; these virtues are his brothers, his true brothers.<BR>
 Going to the world hereafter, those who have no Guru are not accepted; they are beaten, and expelled. ||4||1||<BR>
 Sorat'h, First Mehl, First House:<BR>
 Make your mind the farmer, good deeds the farm, modesty the water, and your body the field.<BR>
 Let the Lord's Name be the seed, contentment the plow, and your humble dress the fence.<BR>
 Doing deeds of love, the seed shall sprout, and you shall see your home flourish. ||1||<BR>
 O Baba, the wealth of Maya does not go with anyone.<BR>
 This Maya has bewitched the world, but only a rare few understand this. ||Pause||<BR>
 Make your ever-decreasing life your shop, and make the Lord's Name your merchandise.<BR>
 Make understanding and contemplation your warehouse, and in that warehouse, store the Lord's Name.<BR>
 Deal with the Lord's dealers, earn your profits, and rejoice in your mind. ||2||<BR>
 Let your trade be listening to scripture, and let Truth be the horses you take to sell.<BR>
 Gather up merits for your travelling expenses, and do not think of tomorrow in your mind.<BR>
 When you arrive in the land of the Formless Lord, you shall find peace in the Mansion of His Presence. ||3||<BR>
 Let your service be the focusing of your consciousness, and let your occupation be the placing of faith in the Naam.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 002</H2></CENTER>
 Let your work be restraint from sin; only then will people call you blessed.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Lord shall look upon you with His Glance of Grace, and you shall be blessed with honor four times over. ||4||2||<BR>
 Sorat'h, First Mehl, Chau-Tukas:<BR>
 The son is dear to his mother and father; he is the wise son-in-law to his father-in-law.<BR>
 The father is dear to his son and daughter, and the brother is very dear to his brother.<BR>
 By the Order of the Lord's Command, he leaves his house and goes outside, and in an instant, everything becomes alien to him.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh does not remember the Name of the Lord, does not give in charity, and does not cleanse his consciousness; his body rolls in the dust. ||1||<BR>
 The mind is comforted by the Comforter of the Naam.<BR>
 I fall at the Guru's feet - I am a sacrifice to Him; He has given me to understand the true understanding. ||Pause||<BR>
 The mind is impressed with the false love of the world; he quarrels with the Lord's humble servant.<BR>
 Infatuated with Maya, night and day, he sees only the worldly path; he does not chant the Naam, and drinking poison, he dies.<BR>
 He is imbued and infatuated with vicious talk; the Word of the Shabad does not come into his consciousness.<BR>
 He is not imbued with the Lord's Love, and he is not impressed by the taste of the Name; the self-willed manmukh loses his honor. ||2||<BR>
 He does not enjoy celestial peace in the Company of the Holy, and there is not even a bit of sweetness on his tongue.<BR>
 He calls his mind, body and wealth his own; he has no knowledge of the Court of the Lord.<BR>
 Closing his eyes, he walks in darkness; he cannot see the home of his own being, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 Tied up at Death's door, he finds no place of rest; he receives the rewards of his own actions. ||3||<BR>
 When the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, then I see Him with my own eyes; He is indescribable, and cannot be described.<BR>
 With my ears, I continually listen to the Word of the Shabad, and I praise Him; His Ambrosial Name abides within my heart.<BR>
 He is Fearless, Formless and absolutely without vengeance; I am absorbed in His Perfect Light.<BR>
 O Nanak, without the Guru, doubt is not dispelled; through the True Name, glorious greatness is obtained. ||4||3||<BR>
 Sorat'h, First Mehl, Du-Tukas:<BR>
 In the realm of land, and in the realm of water, Your seat is the chamber of the four directions.<BR>
 Yours is the one and only form of the entire universe; Your mouth is the mint to fashion all. ||1||<BR>
 O my Lord Master, Your play is so wonderful!<BR>
 You are pervading and permeating the water, the land and the sky; You Yourself are contained in all. ||Pause||<BR>
 Wherever I look, there I see Your Light, but what is Your form?<BR>
 You have one form, but it is unseen; there is none like any other. ||2||<BR>
 The beings born of eggs, born of the womb, born of the earth and born of sweat, all are created by You.<BR>
 I have seen one glory of Yours, that You are pervading and permeating in all. ||3||<BR>
 Your Glories are so numerous, and I do not know even one of them; I am such a fool - please, give me some of them!<BR>
 Prays Nanak, listen, O my Lord Master: I am sinking like a stone - please, save me! ||4||4||<BR>
 Sorat'h, First Mehl:<BR>
 I am a wicked sinner and a great hypocrite; You are the Immaculate and Formless Lord.<BR>
 Tasting the Ambrosial Nectar, I am imbued with supreme bliss; O Lord and Master, I seek Your Sanctuary. ||1||<BR>
 O Creator Lord, You are the honor of the dishonored.<BR>
 In my lap is the honor and glory of the wealth of the Name; I merge into the True Word of the Shabad. ||Pause||<BR>
 You are perfect, while I am worthless and imperfect. You are profound, while I am trivial.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 003</H2></CENTER>
 My mind is imbued with You, day and night and morning, O Lord; my tongue chants Your Name, and my mind meditates on You. ||2||<BR>
 You are True, and I am absorbed into You; through the mystery of the Shabad, I shall ultimately become True as well.<BR>
 Those who are imbued with the Naam day and night are pure, while those who die to be reborn are impure. ||3||<BR>
 I do not see any other like the Lord; who else should I praise? No one is equal to Him.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, I am the slave of His slaves; by Guru's Instruction, I know Him. ||4||5||<BR>
 Sorat'h, First Mehl:<BR>
 He is unknowable, infinite, unapproachable and imperceptible. He is not subject to death or karma.<BR>
 His caste is casteless; He is unborn, self-illumined, and free of doubt and desire. ||1||<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to the Truest of the True.<BR>
 He has no form, no color and no features; through the True Word of the Shabad, He reveals Himself. ||Pause||<BR>
 He has no mother, father, sons or relatives; He is free of sexual desire; He has no wife.<BR>
 He has no ancestry; He is immaculate. He is infinite and endless; O Lord, Your Light is pervading all. ||2||<BR>
 Deep within each and every heart, God is hidden; His Light is in each and every heart.<BR>
 The heavy doors are opened by Guru's Instructions; one becomes fearless, in the trance of deep meditation. ||3||<BR>
 The Lord created all beings, and placed death over the heads of all; all the world is under His Power.<BR>
 Serving the True Guru, the treasure is obtained; living the Word of the Shabad, one is emancipated. ||4||<BR>
 In the pure vessel, the True Name is contained; how few are those who practice true conduct.<BR>
 The individual soul is united with the Supreme Soul; Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary, Lord. ||5||6||<BR>
 Sorat'h, First Mehl:<BR>
 Like a fish without water is the faithless cynic, who dies of thirst.<BR>
 So shall you die, O mind, without the Lord, as your breath goes in vain. ||1||<BR>
 O mind, chant the Lord's Name, and praise Him.<BR>
 Without the Guru, how will you obtain this juice? The Guru shall unite you with the Lord. ||Pause||<BR>
 For the Gurmukh, meeting with the Society of the Saints is like making a pilgrimage to a sacred shrine.<BR>
 The benefit of bathing at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage is obtained by the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan. ||2||<BR>
 Like the Yogi without abstinence, and like penance without truth and contentment,<BR>
 so is the body without the Lord's Name; death will slay it, because of the sin within. ||3||<BR>
 The faithless cynic does not obtain the Lord's Love; the Lord's Love is obtained only through the True Guru.<BR>
 One who meets with the Guru, the Giver of pleasure and pain, says Nanak, is absorbed in the Lord's Praise. ||4||7||<BR>
 Sorat'h, First Mehl:<BR>
 You, God, are the Giver of gifts, the Lord of perfect understanding; I am a mere beggar at Your Door.<BR>
 What should I beg for? Nothing remains permanent; O Lord, please, bless me with Your Beloved Name. ||1||<BR>
 In each and every heart, the Lord, the Lord of the forest, is permeating and pervading.<BR>
 In the water, on the land, and in the sky, He is pervading but hidden; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is revealed. ||Pause||<BR>
 In this world, in the nether regions of the underworld, and in the Akaashic Ethers, the Guru, the True Guru, has shown me the Lord; He has showered me with His Mercy.<BR>
 He is the unborn Lord God; He is, and shall ever be. Deep within your heart, behold Him, the Destroyer of ego. ||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 004</H2></CENTER>
 This wretched world is caught in birth and death; in the love of duality, it has forgotten devotional worship of the Lord.<BR>
 Meeting the True Guru, the Guru's Teachings are obtained; the faithless cynic loses the game of life. ||3||<BR>
 Breaking my bonds, the True Guru has set me free, and I shall not be cast into the womb of reincarnation again.<BR>
 O Nanak, the jewel of spiritual wisdom shines forth, and the Lord, the Formless Lord, dwells within my mind. ||4||8||<BR>
 Sorat'h, First Mehl:<BR>
 The treasure of the Name, for which you have come into the world - that Ambrosial Nectar is with the Guru.<BR>
 Renounce costumes, disguises and clever tricks; this fruit is not obtained by duplicity. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, remain steady, and do not wander away.<BR>
 By searching around on the outside, you shall only suffer great pain; the Ambrosial Nectar is found within the home of your own being. ||Pause||<BR>
 Renounce corruption, and seek virtue; committing sins, you shall only come to regret and repent.<BR>
 You do not know the difference between good and evil; again and again, you sink into the mud. ||2||<BR>
 Within you is the great filth of greed and falsehood; why do you bother to wash your body on the outside?<BR>
 Chant the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord always, under Guru's Instruction; only then will your innermost being be emancipated. ||3||<BR>
 Let greed and slander be far away from you, and renounce falsehood; through the True Word of the Guru's Shabad, you shall obtain the true fruit.<BR>
 As it pleases You, You preserve me, Dear Lord; servant Nanak sings the Praises of Your Shabad. ||4||9||<BR>
 Sorat'h, First Mehl, Panch-Padas:<BR>
 You cannot save your own home from being plundered; why do you spy on the houses of others?<BR>
 That Gurmukh who joins himself to the Guru's service, saves his own home, and tastes the Lord's Nectar. ||1||<BR>
 O mind, you must realize what your intellect is focused on.<BR>
 Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one is involved with other tastes; the unfortunate wretch shall come to regret it in the end. ||Pause||<BR>
 When things come, he is pleased, but when they go, he weeps and wails; this pain and pleasure remains attached to him.<BR>
 The Lord Himself causes him to enjoy pleasure and endure pain; the Gurmukh, however, remains unaffected. ||2||<BR>
 What else can be said to be above the subtle essence of the Lord? One who drinks it in is satisfied and satiated.<BR>
 One who is lured by Maya loses this juice; that faithless cynic is tied to his evil-mindedness. ||3||<BR>
 The Lord is the life of the mind, the Master of the breath of life; the Divine Lord is contained in the body.<BR>
 If You so bless us, Lord, then we sing Your Praises; the mind is satisfied and fulfilled, lovingly attached to the Lord. ||4||<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the subtle essence of the Lord is obtained; meeting the Guru, the fear of death departs.<BR>
 O Nanak, chant the Name of the Lord, as Gurmukh; you shall obtain the Lord, and realize your pre-ordained destiny. ||5||10||<BR>
 Sorat'h, First Mehl:<BR>
 Destiny, pre-ordained by the Lord, looms over the heads of all beings; no one is without this pre-ordained destiny.<BR>
 Only He Himself is beyond destiny; creating the creation by His creative power, He beholds it, and causes His Command to be followed. ||1||<BR>
 O mind, chant the Name of the Lord, and be at peace.<BR>
 Day and night, serve at the Guru's feet; the Lord is the Giver, and the Enjoyer. ||Pause||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 005</H2></CENTER>
 He is within - see Him outside as well; there is no one, other than Him.<BR>
 As Gurmukh, look upon all with the single eye of equality; in each and every heart, the Divine Light is contained. ||2||<BR>
 Restrain your fickle mind, and keep it steady within its own home; meeting the Guru, this understanding is obtained.<BR>
 Seeing the unseen Lord, you shall be amazed and delighted; forgetting your pain, you shall be at peace. ||3||<BR>
 Drinking in the ambrosial nectar, you shall attain the highest bliss, and dwell within the home of your own self.<BR>
 So sing the Praises of the Lord, the Destroyer of the fear of birth and death, and you shall not be reincarnated again. ||4||<BR>
 The essence, the immaculate Lord, the Light of all - I am He and He is me - there is no difference between us.<BR>
 The Infinite Transcendent Lord, the Supreme Lord God - Nanak has met with Him, the Guru. ||5||11||<BR>
 Sorat'h, First Mehl, Third House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 When I am pleasing to Him, then I sing His Praises.<BR>
 Singing His Praises, I receive the fruits of my rewards.<BR>
 The rewards of singing His Praises are obtained when He Himself gives them. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the treasure is obtained;<BR>
 this is why I remain immersed in the True Name. ||Pause||<BR>
 When I awoke within myself to the Guru's Teachings,<BR>
 then I renounced my fickle intellect.<BR>
 When the Light of the Guru's Teachings dawned,<BR>
 and then all darkness was dispelled. ||2||<BR>
 When the mind is attached to the Guru's Feet,<BR>
 then the Path of Death recedes.<BR>
 Through the Fear of God, one attains the Fearless Lord;<BR>
 then, one enters the home of celestial bliss. ||3||<BR>
 Prays Nanak, how rare are those who reflect and understand,<BR>
 the most sublime action in this world.<BR>
 The noblest deed is to sing the Lord's Praises,<BR>
 and so meet the Lord Himself. ||4||1||12||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Third Mehl, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 All of Your servants, who relish the Word of Your Shabad, serve You.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, they become pure, eradicating self-conceit from within.<BR>
 Night and day, they continually sing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord; they are adorned with the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||<BR>
 O my Lord and Master, I am Your child; I seek Your Sanctuary.<BR>
 You are the One and Only Lord, the Truest of the True; You Yourself are the Destroyer of ego. ||Pause||<BR>
 Those who remain wakeful obtain God; through the Word of the Shabad, they conquer their ego.<BR>
 Immersed in family life, the Lord's humble servant ever remains detached; he reflects upon the essence of spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 Serving the True Guru, he finds eternal peace, and he keeps the Lord enshrined in his heart. ||2||<BR>
 This mind wanders in the ten directions; it is consumed by the love of duality.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 006</H2></CENTER>
 The foolish self-willed manmukh does not remember the Lord's Name; he wastes away his life in vain.<BR>
 But when he meets the True Guru, then he obtains the Name; he sheds egotism and emotional attachment. ||3||<BR>
 The Lord's humble servants are True - they practice Truth, and reflect upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 The True Lord God unites them with Himself, and they keep the True Lord enshrined in their hearts.<BR>
 O Nanak, through the Name, I have obtained salvation and understanding; this alone is my wealth. ||4||1||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The True Lord has blessed His devotees with the treasure of devotional worship, and the wealth of the Lord's Name.<BR>
 The wealth of the Naam, shall never be exhausted; no one can estimate its worth.<BR>
 With the wealth of the Naam, their faces are radiant, and they attain the True Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord is found.<BR>
 Without the Shabad, the world wanders around, and receives its punishment in the Court of the Lord. ||Pause||<BR>
 Within this body dwell the five thieves: sexual desire, anger, greed, emotional attachment and egotism.<BR>
 They plunder the Nectar, but the self-willed manmukh does not realize it; no one hears his complaint.<BR>
 The world is blind, and its dealings are blind as well; without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness. ||2||<BR>
 Indulging in egotism and possessiveness, they are ruined; when they depart, nothing goes along with them.<BR>
 But one who becomes Gurmukh meditates on the Naam, and ever contemplates the Lord's Name.<BR>
 Through the True Word of Gurbani, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord; blessed with the Lord's Glance of Grace, he is enraptured. ||3||<BR>
 The spiritual wisdom of the True Guru is a steady light within the heart. The Lord's decree is over the heads of even kings.<BR>
 Night and day, the Lord's devotees worship Him; night and day, they gather in the true profit of the Lord's Name.<BR>
 O Nanak, through the Lord's Name, one is emancipated; attuned to the Shabad, he finds the Lord. ||4||2||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Third Mehl:<BR>
 If one becomes the slave of the Lord's slaves, then he finds the Lord, and eradicates ego from within.<BR>
 The Lord of bliss is his object of devotion; night and day, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<BR>
 Attuned to the Word of the Shabad, the Lord's devotees remain ever as one, absorbed in the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O Dear Lord, Your Glance of Grace is True.<BR>
 Show mercy to Your slave, O Beloved Lord, and preserve my honor. ||Pause||<BR>
 Continually praising the Word of the Shabad, I live; under Guru's Instruction, my fear has been dispelled.<BR>
 My True Lord God is so beautiful! Serving the Guru, my consciousness is focused on Him.<BR>
 One who chants the True Word of the Shabad, and the Truest of the True, the Word of His Bani, remains wakeful, day and night. ||2||<BR>
 He is so very deep and profound, the Giver of eternal peace; no one can find His limit.<BR>
 Serving the Perfect Guru, one becomes carefree, enshrining the Lord within the mind.<BR>
 The mind and body become immaculately pure, and a lasting peace fills the heart; doubt is eradicated from within. ||3||<BR>
 The Way of the Lord is always such a difficult path; only a few find it, contemplating the Guru.<BR>
 Imbued with the Lord's Love, and intoxicated with the Shabad, he renounces ego and corruption.<BR>
 O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, and the Love of the One Lord, he is embellished with the Word of the Shabad. ||4||3||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 007</H2></CENTER>
 Sorat'h, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Dear Beloved Lord, I praise You continually, as long as there is the breath within my body.<BR>
 If I were to forget You, for a moment, even for an instant, O Lord Master, it would be like fifty years for me.<BR>
 I was always such a fool and an idiot, O Siblings of Destiny, but now, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, my mind is enlightened. ||1||<BR>
 Dear Lord, You Yourself bestow understanding.<BR>
 Dear Lord, I am forever a sacrifice to You; I am dedicated and devoted to Your Name. ||Pause||<BR>
 I have died in the Word of the Shabad, and through the Shabad, I am dead while yet alive, O Siblings of Destiny; through the Shabad, I have been liberated.<BR>
 Through the Shabad, my mind and body have been purified, and the Lord has come to dwell within my mind.<BR>
 The Guru is the Giver of the Shabad; my mind is imbued with it, and I remain absorbed in the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Those who do not know the Shabad are blind and deaf; why did they even bother to come into the world?<BR>
 They do not obtain the subtle essence of the Lord's elixir; they waste away their lives, and are reincarnated over and over again.<BR>
 The blind, idiotic, self-willed manmukhs are like maggots in manure, and in manure they rot away. ||3||<BR>
 The Lord Himself creates us, watches over us, and places us on the Path, O Siblings of Destiny; there is no one other than Him.<BR>
 No one can erase that which is pre-ordained, O Siblings of Destiny; whatever the Creator wills, comes to pass.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within the mind; O Siblings of Destiny, there is no other at all. ||4||4||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The Gurmukhs practice devotional worship, and become pleasing to God; night and day, they chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 You Yourself protect and take care of Your devotees, who are pleasing to Your Mind.<BR>
 You are the Giver of virtue, realized through the Word of Your Shabad. Uttering Your Glories, we merge with You, O Glorious Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, remember always the Dear Lord.<BR>
 At the very last moment, He alone shall be your best friend; He shall always stand by you. ||Pause||<BR>
 The gathering of the wicked enemies shall always practice falsehood; they do not contemplate understanding.<BR>
 Who can obtain fruit from the slander of evil enemies? Remember that Harnaakhash was torn apart by the Lord's claws.<BR>
 Prahlaad, the Lord's humble servant, constantly sang the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and the Dear Lord saved him. ||2||<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs see themselves as being very virtuous; they have absolutely no understanding at all.<BR>
 They indulge in slander of the humble spiritual people; they waste their lives away, and then they have to depart.<BR>
 They never think of the Lord's Name, and in the end, they depart, regretting and repenting. ||3||<BR>
 The Lord makes the lives of His devotees fruitful; He Himself links them to the Guru's service.<BR>
 Imbued with the Word of the Shabad, and intoxicated with celestial bliss, night and day, they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<BR>
 Slave Nanak utters this prayer: O Lord, please, let me fall at their feet. ||4||5||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Third Mehl:<BR>
 He alone is a Sikh, a friend, a relative and a sibling, who walks in the Way of the Guru's Will.<BR>
 One who walks according to his own will, O Siblings of Destiny, suffers separation from the Lord, and shall be punished.<BR>
 Without the True Guru, peace is never obtained, O Siblings of Destiny; again and again, he regrets and repents. ||1||<BR>
 The Lord's slaves are happy, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 008</H2></CENTER>
 The sins and sorrows of countless lifetimes are eradicated; the Lord Himself unites them in His Union. ||Pause||<BR>
 All of these relatives are like chains upon the soul, O Siblings of Destiny; the world is deluded by doubt.<BR>
 Without the Guru, the chains cannot be broken; the Gurmukhs find the door of salvation.<BR>
 One who performs rituals without realizing the Word of the Guru's Shabad, shall die and be reborn, again and again. ||2||<BR>
 The world is entangled in egotism and possessiveness, O Siblings of Destiny, but no one belongs to anyone else.<BR>
 The Gurmukhs attain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, singing the Glories of the Lord; they dwell in the home of their own inner being.<BR>
 One who understands here, realizes himself; the Lord God belongs to him. ||3||<BR>
 The True Guru is forever merciful, O Siblings of Destiny; without good destiny, what can anyone obtain?<BR>
 He looks alike upon all with His Glance of Grace, but people receive the fruits of their rewards according to their love for the Lord.<BR>
 O Nanak, when the Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to dwell within the mind, then self-conceit is eradicated from within. ||4||6||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Third Mehl, Chau-Tukas:<BR>
 True devotional worship is obtained only through the True Guru, when the True Word of His Bani is in the heart.<BR>
 Serving the True Guru, eternal peace is obtained; egotism is obliterated through the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 Without the Guru, there is no true devotion; otherwise, people wander around, deluded by ignorance.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs wander around, suffering in constant pain; they drown and die, even without water. ||1||<BR>
 O Siblings of Destiny, remain forever in the Lord's Sanctuary, under His Protection.<BR>
 Bestowing His Glance of Grace, He preserves our honor, and blesses us with the glory of the Lord's Name. ||Pause||<BR>
 Through the Perfect Guru, one comes to understand himself, contemplating the True Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 The Lord, the Life of the world, ever abides in his heart, and he renounces sexual desire, anger and egotism.<BR>
 The Lord is ever-present, permeating and pervading all places; the Name of the Infinite Lord is enshrined within the heart.<BR>
 Throughout the ages, through the Word of His Bani, His Shabad is realized, and the Name becomes so sweet and beloved to the mind. ||2||<BR>
 Serving the Guru, one realizes the Naam, the Name of the Lord; fruitful is his life, and his coming into the world.<BR>
 Tasting the sublime elixir of the Lord, his mind is satisfied and satiated forever; singing the Glories of the Glorious Lord, he is fulfilled and satisfied.<BR>
 The lotus of his heart blossoms forth, he is ever imbued with the Lord's Love, and the unstruck melody of the Shabad resounds within him.<BR>
 His body and mind become immaculately pure; his speech becomes immaculate as well, and he merges in the Truest of the True. ||3||<BR>
 No one knows the state of the Lord's Name; through the Guru's Teachings, it comes to abide in the heart.<BR>
 One who becomes Gurmukh, understands the Path; his tongue savors the sublime essence of the Lord's Nectar.<BR>
 Meditation, austere self-discipline and self-restraint are all obtained from the Guru; the Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to abide within the heart.<BR>
 O Nanak, those humble beings who praise the Naam are beautiful; they are honored in the Court of the True Lord. ||4||7||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Third Mehl, Du-Tukas:<BR>
 Meeting the True Guru, one turns away from the world, O Siblings of Destiny; when he remains dead while yet alive, he obtains true understanding.<BR>
 He alone is the Guru, and he alone is a Sikh, O Siblings of Destiny, whose light merges in the Light. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, be lovingly attuned to the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 Chanting the Name of the Lord, it seems so sweet to the mind, O Siblings of Destiny; the Gurmukhs obtain a place in the Court of the Lord. ||Pause||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 009</H2></CENTER>
 Without the Guru, love for the Lord does not well up, O Siblings of Destiny; the self-willed manmukhs are engrossed in the love of duality.<BR>
 Actions performed by the manmukh are like the threshing of the chaff - they obtain nothing for their efforts. ||2||<BR>
 Meeting the Guru, the Naam comes to permeate the mind, O Siblings of Destiny, with true love and affection.<BR>
 He always sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny, with infinite love for the Guru. ||3||<BR>
 How blessed and approved is his coming into the world, O Siblings of Destiny, who focuses his mind on serving the Guru.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Name of the Lord is obtained, O Siblings of Destiny, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and we merge with the Lord. ||4||8||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Third Mehl, First House:<BR>
 The three worlds are entangled in the three qualities, O Siblings of Destiny; the Guru imparts understanding.<BR>
 Attached to the Lord's Name, one is emancipated, O Siblings of Destiny; go and ask the wise ones about this. ||1||<BR>
 O mind, renounce the three qualities, and focus your consciousness on the fourth state.<BR>
 The Dear Lord abides in the mind, O Siblings of Destiny; ever sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||Pause||<BR>
 From the Naam, everyone originated, O Siblings of Destiny; forgetting the Naam, they die away.<BR>
 The ignorant world is blind, O Siblings of Destiny; those who sleep are plundered. ||2||<BR>
 Those Gurmukhs who remain awake are saved, O Siblings of Destiny; they cross over the terrifying world-ocean.<BR>
 In this world, the Name of the Lord is the true profit, O Siblings of Destiny; keep it enshrined within your heart. ||3||<BR>
 In the Guru's Sanctuary, O Siblings of Destiny, you shall be saved; be lovingly attuned to the Lord's Name.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Name of the Lord is the boat, and the Name is the raft, O Siblings of Destiny; setting out on it, the Lord's humble servant crosses over the world-ocean. ||4||9||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Third Mehl, First House:<BR>
 The True Guru is the ocean of peace in the world; there is no other place of rest and peace.<BR>
 The world is afflicted with the painful disease of egotism; dying, only to be reborn, it cries out in pain. ||1||<BR>
 O mind, serve the True Guru, and obtain peace.<BR>
 If you serve the True Guru, you shall find peace; otherwise, you shall depart, after wasting away your life in vain. ||Pause||<BR>
 Led around by the three qualities, he does many deeds, but he does not come to taste and savor the subtle essence of the Lord.<BR>
 He says his evening prayers, and makes offerings of water, and recites his morning prayers, but without true understanding, he still suffers in pain. ||2||<BR>
 One who serves the True Guru is very fortunate; as the Lord so wills, he meets with the Guru.<BR>
 Drinking in the sublime essence of the Lord, His humble servants remain ever satisfied; they eradicate self-conceit from within themselves. ||3||<BR>
 This world is blind, and all act blindly; without the Guru, no one finds the Path.<BR>
 O Nanak, meeting with the True Guru, one sees with his eyes, and finds the True Lord within the home of his own being. ||4||10||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Without serving the True Guru, he suffers in terrible pain, and throughout the four ages, he wanders aimlessly.<BR>
 I am poor and meek, and throughout the ages, You are the Great Giver - please, grant me the understanding of the Shabad. ||1||<BR>
 O Dear Beloved Lord, please show mercy to me.<BR>
 Unite me in the Union of the True Guru, the Great Giver, and give me the support of the Lord's Name. ||Pause||<BR>
 Conquering my desires and duality, I have merged in celestial peace, and I have found the Naam, the Name of the Infinite Lord.<BR>
 I have tasted the sublime essence of the Lord, and my soul has become immaculately pure; the Lord is the Destroyer of sins. ||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 010</H2></CENTER>
 Dying in the Word of the Shabad, you shall live forever, and you shall never die again.<BR>
 The Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam is ever-sweet to the mind; but how few are those who obtain the Shabad. ||3||<BR>
 The Great Giver keeps His Gifts in His Hand; He gives them to those with whom He is pleased.<BR>
 O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, they find peace, and in the Court of the Lord, they are exalted. ||4||11||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Serving the True Guru, the divine melody wells up within, and one is blessed with wisdom and salvation.<BR>
 The True Name of the Lord comes to abide in the mind, and through the Name, one merges in the Name. ||1||<BR>
 Without the True Guru, the whole world is insane.<BR>
 The blind, self-willed manmukhs do not realize the Word of the Shabad; they are deluded by false doubts. ||Pause||<BR>
 The three-faced Maya had led them astray in doubt, and they are snared by the noose of egotism.<BR>
 Birth and death hang over their heads, and being reborn from the womb, they suffer in pain. ||2||<BR>
 The three qualities permeate the whole world; acting in ego, it loses its honor.<BR>
 But one who becomes Gurmukh comes to realize the fourth state of celestial bliss; he finds peace through the Name of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 The three qualities are all Yours, O Lord; You Yourself created them. Whatever You do, comes to pass.<BR>
 O Nanak, through the Lord's Name, one is emancipated; through the Shabad, he is rid of egotism. ||4||12||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>

 Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 He Himself is born of the egg, from the womb, from sweat and from the earth; He Himself is the continents and all the worlds.<BR>
 He Himself is the thread, and He Himself is the many beads; through His Almighty Power, He has strung the worlds.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 011</H2></CENTER>
 He holds the thread, and when He withdraws the thread, the beads scatter into heaps. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, there is no other than the Lord for me.<BR>
 The treasure of the Beloved Naam is within the True Guru; in His Mercy, he pours the Ambrosial Nectar into my mouth. ||Pause||<BR>
 The Beloved Himself is in all the oceans and lands; whatever God does, comes to pass.<BR>
 The Beloved brings nourishment to all; there is no other than Him.<BR>
 The Beloved Himself plays, and whatever He Himself does, comes to pass. ||2||<BR>
 The Beloved Himself, all by Himself, is immaculate and pure; He Himself is immaculate and pure.<BR>
 The Beloved Himself determines the value of all; whatever He does comes to pass.<BR>
 The Beloved Himself is unseen - He cannot be seen; He Himself causes us to see. ||3||<BR>
 The Beloved Himself is deep and profound and unfathomable; there is no other as great as He.<BR>
 The Beloved Himself enjoys every heart; He is contained within every woman and man.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Beloved is pervading everywhere, but He is hidden; through the Guru, He is revealed. ||4||2||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 He Himself, the Beloved, is Himself all-in-all; He Himself establishes and disestablishes.<BR>
 The Beloved Himself beholds, and rejoices; God Himself works wonders, and beholds them.<BR>
 The Beloved Himself is contained in all the woods and meadows; as Gurmukh, He reveals Himself. ||1||<BR>
 Meditate, O mind, on the Lord, Har, Har; through the sublime essence of Lord's Name, you shall be satisfied.<BR>

 The Beloved is Himself the place of pilgrimage and the raft; God Himself ferries Himself across.<BR>
 The Beloved Himself casts the net over all the world; the Lord Himself is the fish.<BR>

 The Beloved Himself is the Ambrosial Nectar; He Himself is the juice of it.<BR>
 The Beloved Himself praises Himself; servant Nanak is satisfied, with the sublime essence of the Lord. ||4||3||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 God Himself is the balance scale, He Himself is the weigher, and He Himself weighs with the weights.<BR>
 He Himself is the banker, He Himself is the trader, and He Himself makes the trades.<BR>
 The Beloved Himself fashioned the world, and He Himself counter-balances it with a gram. ||1||<BR>
 My mind meditates on the Lord, Har, Har, and finds peace.<BR>
 The Name of the Beloved Lord, Har, Har, is a treasure; the Perfect Guru has made it seem sweet to me. ||Pause||<BR>
 The Beloved Himself is the earth, and He Himself is the water; He Himself acts, and causes others to act.<BR>
 The Beloved Himself issues His Commands, and keeps the water and the land bound down.<BR>
 The Beloved Himself instills the Fear of God; He binds the tiger and the goat together. ||2||<BR>

 The Beloved Himself causes us to sing His Glorious Praises; He Himself is absorbed in the Word of His Shabad.<BR>

 Whoever harbors pride shall be destroyed, O Beloved; meditating on the Lord, Nanak is absorbed in devotional worship. ||4||6||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl, Du-Tukas:<BR>
 Separated from the Lord for countless lifetimes, the self-willed manmukh suffers in pain, engaged in acts of egotism.<BR>
 Beholding the Holy Saint, I found God; O Lord of the Universe, I seek Your Sanctuary. ||1||<BR>
 The Love of God is very dear to me.<BR>
 When I joined the Sat Sangat, the Company of the Holy People, the Lord, the embodiment of peace, came into my heart. ||Pause||<BR>
 You dwell, hidden, within my heart day and night, Lord; but the poor fools do not understand Your Love.<BR>
 Meeting with the Almighty True Guru, God was revealed to me; I sing His Glorious Praises, and reflect upon His Glories. ||2||<BR>
 As Gurmukh, I have become enlightened; peace has come, and evil-mindedness has been dispelled from my mind.<BR>
 Understanding the relationship of the individual soul with God, I have found peace, in Your Sat Sangat, Your True Congregation, O Lord. ||3||<BR>
 Those who are blessed by Your Kind Mercy, meet the Almighty Lord, and find the Guru.<BR>
 Nanak has found the immeasurable, celestial peace; night and day, he remains awake to the Lord, the Master of the Forest of the Universe. ||4||7||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 The inner depths of my mind are pierced by love for the Lord; I cannot live without the Lord.<BR>
 Just as the fish dies without water, I die without the Lord's Name. ||1||<BR>
 O my God, please bless me with the water of Your Name.<BR>
 I beg for Your Name, deep within myself, day and night; through the Name, I find peace. ||Pause||<BR>
 The song-bird cries out for lack of water - without water, its thirst cannot be quenched.<BR>
 The Gurmukh obtains the water of celestial bliss, and is rejuvenated, blossoming forth through the blessed Love of the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs are hungry, wandering around in the ten directions; without the Name, they suffer in pain.<BR>
 They are born, only to die, and enter into reincarnation again; in the Court of the Lord, they are punished. ||3||<BR>
 But if the Lord shows His Mercy, then one comes to sing His Glorious Praises; deep within the nucleus of his own self, he finds the sublime essence of the Lord's elixir.<BR>
 The Lord has become Merciful to meek Nanak, and through the Word of the Shabad, his desires are quenched. ||4||8||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl, Panch-Padas:<BR>
 If one eats the uneatable, then he becomes a Siddha, a being of perfect spirituality; through this perfection, he obtains wisdom.<BR>
 When the arrow of the Lord's Love pierces his body, then his doubt is eradicated. ||1||<BR>
 O my Lord of the Universe, please bless Your humble servant with glory.<BR>
 Under Guru's Instructions, enlighten me with the Lord's Name, that I may dwell forever in Your Sanctuary. ||Pause||<BR>
 This whole world is engrossed in coming and going; O my foolish and ignorant mind, be mindful of the Lord.<BR>
 O Dear Lord, please, take pity upon me, and unite me with the Guru, that I may merge in the Lord's Name. ||2||<BR>
 Only one who has it knows God; he alone has it, to whom God has given it - so very beautiful, unapproachable and unfathomable. Through the Perfect Guru, the unknowable is known. ||3||<BR>
 Only one who tastes it knows it, like the mute, who tastes the sweet candy, but cannot speak of it.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 014</H2></CENTER>
 The jewel is concealed, but it is not concealed, even though one may try to conceal it. ||4||<BR>
 Everything is Yours, O Inner-knower, Searcher of hearts; You are the Lord God of all.<BR>
 He alone receives the gift, unto whom You give it; O servant Nanak, there is no one else. ||5||9||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, First House, Ti-Tukas:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Who should I ask? Who should I worship? All were created by Him.<BR>
 Whoever appears to be the greatest of the great, shall ultimately be mixed with the dust.<BR>
 The Fearless, Formless Lord, the Destroyer of Fear bestows all comforts, and the nine treasures. ||1||<BR>
 O Dear Lord, Your gifts alone satisfy me.<BR>
 Why should I praise the poor helpless man? Why should I feel subservient to him? ||Pause||<BR>
 All things come to one who meditates on the Lord; the Lord satisfies his hunger.<BR>
 The Lord, the Giver of peace, bestows such wealth, that it can never be exhausted.<BR>
 I am in ecstasy, absorbed in celestial peace; the True Guru has united me in His Union. ||2||<BR>
 O mind, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord; worship the Naam, night and day, and recite the Naam.<BR>
 Listen to the Teachings of the Holy Saints, and all fear of death will be dispelled.<BR>
 Those blessed by God's Grace are attached to the Word of the Guru's Bani. ||3||<BR>
 Who can estimate Your worth, God? You are kind and compassionate to all beings.<BR>
 Everything which You do, prevails; I am just a poor child - what can I do?<BR>
 Protect and preserve Your servant Nanak; be kind to him, like a father to his son. ||4||1||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, First House, Chau-Tukas:<BR>
 Praise the Guru, and the Lord of the Universe, O Siblings of Destiny; enshrine Him in your mind, body and heart.<BR>
 Let the True Lord and Master abide in your mind, O Siblings of Destiny; this is the most excellent way of life.<BR>
 Those bodies, in which the Name of the Lord does not well up, O Siblings of Destiny - those bodies are reduced to ashes.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Siblings of Destiny; they take the Support of the One and Only Lord. ||1||<BR>
 So worship and adore that True Lord, O Siblings of Destiny; He alone does everything.<BR>
 The Perfect Guru has taught me, O Siblings of Destiny, that without Him, there is no other at all. ||Pause||<BR>
 Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they putrefy and die, O Siblings of Destiny; their numbers cannot be counted.<BR>
 Without Truth, purity cannot be achieved, O Siblings of Destiny; the Lord is true and unfathomable.<BR>
 Coming and going do not end, O Siblings of Destiny; pride in worldly valuables is false.<BR>
 The Gurmukh saves millions of people, O Siblings of Destiny, blessing them with even a particle of the Name. ||2||<BR>
 I have searched through the Simritees and the Shaastras, O Siblings of Destiny - without the True Guru, doubt does not depart.<BR>
 They are so tired of performing their many deeds, O Siblings of Destiny, but they fall into bondage again and again.<BR>
 I have searched in the four directions, O Siblings of Destiny, but without the True Guru, there is no place at all.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 015</H2></CENTER>
 By great good fortune, I found the Guru, O Siblings of Destiny, and I meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||<BR>
 The Truth is forever pure, O Siblings of Destiny; those who are true are pure.<BR>
 When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, O Siblings of Destiny, then one obtains Him.<BR>
 Among millions, O Siblings of Destiny, hardly one humble servant of the Lord is found.<BR>
 Nanak is imbued with the True Name, O Siblings of Destiny; hearing it, the mind and body become immaculately pure. ||4||2||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, Du-Tukas:<BR>
 As long as this person believes in love and hate, it is difficult for him to meet the Lord.<BR>
 As long as he discriminates between himself and others, he will distance himself from the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O Lord, grant me such understanding,<BR>
 that I might serve the Holy Saints, and seek the protection of their feet, and not forget them, for a moment, even an instant. ||Pause||<BR>
 O foolish, thoughtless and fickle mind, such understanding did not come into your heart.<BR>
 Renouncing the Lord of Life, you have become engrossed in other things, and you are involved with your enemies. ||2||<BR>
 Sorrow does not afflict one who does not harbor self-conceit; in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I have attained this understanding.<BR>
 Know that the babbling of the faithless cynic is like wind passing by. ||3||<BR>
 This mind is inundated by millions of sins - what can I say?<BR>
 Nanak, Your humble servant has come to Your Sanctuary, God; please, erase all his accounts. ||4||3||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Children, spouses, men and women in one's household, are all bound by Maya.<BR>
 At the very last moment, none of them shall stand by you; their love is totally false. ||1||<BR>
 O man, why do you pamper your body so?<BR>
 It shall disperse like a cloud of smoke; vibrate upon the One, the Beloved Lord. ||Pause||<BR>
 There are three ways in which the body can be consumed - it can be thrown into water, given to the dogs, or cremated to ashes.<BR>
 He considers himself to be immortal; he sits in his home, and forgets the Lord, the Cause of causes. ||2||<BR>
 In various ways, the Lord has fashioned the beads, and strung them on a slender thread.<BR>
 The thread shall break, O wretched man, and then, you shall repent and regret. ||3||<BR>
 He created you, and after creating you, He adorned you - meditate on Him day and night.<BR>
 God has showered His Mercy upon servant Nanak; I hold tight to the Support of the True Guru. ||4||4||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I met the True Guru, by great good fortune, and my mind has been enlightened.<BR>
 No one else can equal me, because I have the loving support of my Lord and Master. ||1||<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to my True Guru.<BR>
 I am at peace in this world, and I shall be in celestial peace in the next; my home is filled with bliss. ||Pause||<BR>
 He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, the Creator, my Lord and Master.<BR>
 I have become fearless, attached to the Guru's feet; I take the Support of the Name of the One Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Fruitful is the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; the Form of God is deathless; He is and shall always be.<BR>
 He hugs His humble servants close, and protects and preserves them; their love for Him is sweet to Him. ||3||<BR>
 Great is His glorious greatness, and wondrous is His magnificence; through Him, all affairs are resolved.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 016</H2></CENTER>
 Nanak has met with the Perfect Guru; all his sorrows have been dispelled. ||4||5||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 To the happy person, everyone seems happy; to the sick person, everyone seems sick.<BR>
 The Lord and Master acts, and causes us to act; union is in His Hands. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, no one appears to be mistaken, to one who has dispelled his own doubts; he realizes that everyone is God. ||Pause||<BR>
 One whose mind is comforted in the Society of the Saints, believes that all are joyful.<BR>
 One whose mind is afflicted by the disease of egotism, cries out in birth and death. ||2||<BR>
 Everything is clear to one whose eyes are blessed with the ointment of spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 In the darkness of spiritual ignorance, he sees nothing at all; he wanders around in reincarnation, over and over again. ||3||<BR>
 Hear my prayer, O Lord and Master; Nanak begs for this happiness:<BR>
 whereever Your Holy Saints sing the Kirtan of Your Praises, let my mind be attached to that place. ||4||6||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 My body belongs to the Saints, my wealth belongs to the Saints, and my mind belongs to the Saints.<BR>
 By the Grace of the Saints, I meditate on the Lord's Name, and then, all comforts come to me. ||1||<BR>
 Without the Saints, there are no other givers.<BR>
 Whoever takes to the Sanctuary of the Holy Saints, is carried across. ||Pause||<BR>
 Millions of sins are erased by serving the humble Saints, and singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord with love.<BR>
 One finds peace in this world, and one's face is radiant in the next world, by associating with the humble Saints, through great good fortune. ||2||<BR>
 I have only one tongue, and the Lord's humble servant is filled with countless virtues; how can I sing his praises?<BR>
 The inaccessible, unapproachable and eternally unchanging Lord is obtained in the Sanctuary of the Saints. ||3||<BR>
 I am worthless, lowly, without friends or support, and full of sins; I long for the Shelter of the Saints.<BR>
 I am drowning in the deep, dark pit of household attachments - please save me, Lord! ||4||7||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, First House:<BR>
 O Creator Lord, You fulfill the desires of those, within whose heart You abide.<BR>
 Your slaves do not forget You; the dust of Your feet is pleasing to their minds. ||1||<BR>
 Your Unspoken Speech cannot be spoken.<BR>
 O treasure of excellence, Giver of peace, Lord and Master, Your greatness is the highest of all. ||Pause||<BR>
 The mortal does those deeds, and those alone, which You ordained by destiny.<BR>
 Your servant, whom You bless with Your service, is satisfied and fulfilled, beholding the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||2||<BR>
 You are contained in all, but he alone realizes this, whom You bless with understanding.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, his spiritual ignorance is dispelled, and he is respected everywhere. ||3||<BR>
 He alone is spiritually enlightened, he alone is a meditator, and he alone is a man of good nature.<BR>
 Says Nanak, one unto whom the Lord becomes Merciful, does not forget the Lord from his mind. ||4||8||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The whole creation is engrossed in emotional attachment; sometimes, one is high, and at other times, low.<BR>
 No one can be purified by any rituals or devices; they cannot reach their goal. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 017</H2></CENTER>
 O my mind, emancipation is attained in the Sanctuary of the Holy Saints.<BR>
 Without the Perfect Guru, births and deaths do not cease, and one comes and goes, over and over again. ||Pause||<BR>
 The whole world is entangled in what is called the delusion of doubt.<BR>
 The perfect devotee of the Primal Lord God remains detached from everything. ||2||<BR>
 Don't indulge in slander for any reason, for everything is the creation of the Lord and Master.<BR>
 One who is blessed with the Mercy of my God, dwells on the Name in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||3||<BR>
 The Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord, the True Guru, saves all.<BR>
 Says Nanak, without the Guru, no one crosses over; this is the perfect essence of all contemplation. ||4||9||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I have searched and searched and searched, and found that the Lord's Name is the most sublime reality.<BR>
 Contemplating it for even an instant, sins are erased; the Gurmukh is carried across and saved. ||1||<BR>
 Drink in the sublime essence of the Lord's Name, O man of spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 Listening to the Ambrosial Words of the Holy Saints, the mind finds absolute fulfillment and satisfaction. ||Pause||<BR>
 Liberation, pleasures, and the true way of life are obtained from the Lord, the Giver of all peace.<BR>
 The Perfect Lord, the Architect of Destiny, blesses His slave with the gift of devotional worship. ||2||<BR>
 Hear with your ears, and sing with your tongue, and meditate within your heart on Him.<BR>
 The Lord and Master is all-powerful, the Cause of causes; without Him, there is nothing at all. ||3||<BR>
 By great good fortune, I have obtained the jewel of human life; have mercy on me, O Merciful Lord.<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and contemplates Him forever in meditation. ||4||10||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 After taking your cleansing bath, remember your God in meditation, and your mind and body shall be free of disease.<BR>
 Millions of obstacles are removed, in the Sanctuary of God, and good fortune dawns. ||1||<BR>
 The Word of God's Bani, and His Shabad, are the best utterances.<BR>
 So constantly sing them, listen to them, and read them, O Siblings of Destiny, and the Perfect Guru shall save you. ||Pause||<BR>
 The glorious greatness of the True Lord is immeasurable; the Merciful Lord is the Lover of His devotees.<BR>
 He has preserved the honor of His Saints; from the very beginning of time, His Nature is to cherish them. ||2||<BR>
 So eat the Ambrosial Name of the Lord as your food; put it into your mouth at all times.<BR>
 The pains of old age and death shall all depart, when you constantly sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe. ||3||<BR>
 My Lord and Master has heard my prayer, and all my affairs have been resolved.<BR>
 The glorious greatness of Guru Nanak is manifest, throughout all the ages. ||4||11||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, Second House, Chau-Padas:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The One God is our father; we are the children of the One God. You are our Guru.<BR>
 Listen, friends: my soul is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You; O Lord, reveal to me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 018</H2></CENTER>
 Listen, friends: I am a sacrifice to the dust of Your feet.<BR>
 This mind is yours, O Siblings of Destiny. ||Pause||<BR>
 I wash your feet, I massage and clean them; I give this mind to you.<BR>
 Listen, friends: I have come to Your Sanctuary; teach me, that I might unite with God. ||2||<BR>
 Do not be proud; seek His Sanctuary, and accept as good all that He does.<BR>
 Listen, friends: dedicate your soul, body and your whole being to Him; thus you shall receive the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. ||3||<BR>
 He has shown mercy to me, by the Grace of the Saints; the Lord's Name is sweet to me.<BR>
 The Guru has shown mercy to servant Nanak; I see the casteless, immaculate Lord everywhere. ||4||1||12||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 God is the Lord and Master of millions of universes; He is the Giver of all beings.<BR>
 He ever cherishes and cares for all beings, but the fool does not appreciate any of His virtues. ||1||<BR>
 I do not know how to worship the Lord in adoration.<BR>
 I can only repeat, "Lord, Lord, Guru, Guru."<BR>
 O Dear Lord, I go by the name of the Lord's slave. ||Pause||<BR>
 The Compassionate Lord is Merciful to the meek, the ocean of peace; He fills all hearts.<BR>
 He sees, hears, and is always with me; but I am a fool, and I think that He is far away. ||2||<BR>
 The Lord is limitless, but I can only describe Him within my limitations; what do I know, about what He is like?<BR>
 I offer my prayer to my True Guru; I am so foolish - please, teach me! ||3||<BR>
 I am just a fool, but millions of sinners just like me have been saved.<BR>
 Those who have heard, and seen Guru Nanak, do not descend into the womb of reincarnation again. ||4||2||13||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Those things, which caused me such anxiety, have all vanished.<BR>
 Now, I sleep in peace and tranquility, and my mind is in a state of deep and profound peace; the inverted lotus of my heart has blossomed forth. ||1||<BR>
 Behold, a wondrous miracle has happened!<BR>
 That Lord and Master, whose wisdom is said to be unfathomable, has been enshrined within my heart, by the Guru. ||Pause||<BR>
 The demons which tormented me so much, have themselves become terrified.<BR>
 They pray: please, save us from your Lord Master; we seek your protection. ||2||<BR>
 When the treasure of the Lord of the Universe is opened, those who are pre-destined, receive it.<BR>
 The Guru has given me the one jewel, and my mind and body have become peaceful and tranquil. ||3||<BR>
 The Guru has blessed me with the one drop of Ambrosial Nectar, and so I have become stable, unmoving and immortal - I shall not die.<BR>
 The Lord blessed Guru Nanak with the treasure of devotional worship, and did not call him to account again. ||4||3||14||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Those whose minds are attached to the lotus feet of the Lord - those humble beings are satisfied and fulfilled.<BR>
 But those, within whose hearts the priceless virtue does not abide - those men remain thirsty and unsatisfied. ||1||<BR>
 Worshipping the Lord in adoration, one becomes happy, and free of disease.<BR>
 But one who forgets my Dear Lord - know him to be afflicted with tens of thousands of illnesses. ||Pause||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 019</H2></CENTER>
 Those who hold tightly to Your Support, God, are happy in Your Sanctuary.<BR>
 But those humble beings who forget the Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny, are counted among the most miserable beings. ||2||<BR>
 One who has faith in the Guru, and who is lovingly attached to God, enjoys the delights of supreme ecstasy.<BR>
 One who forgets God and forsakes the Guru, falls into the most horrible hell. ||3||<BR>
 As the Lord engages someone, so he is engaged, and so does he perform.<BR>
 Nanak has taken to the Shelter of the Saints; his heart is absorbed in the Lord's feet. ||4||4||15||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 As the king is entangled in kingly affairs, and the egotist in his own egotism,<BR>
 and the greedy man is enticed by greed, so is the spiritually enlightened being absorbed in the Love of the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 This is what befits the Lord's servant.<BR>
 Beholding the Lord near at hand, he serves the True Guru, and he is satisfied through the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises. ||Pause||<BR>
 The addict is addicted to his drug, and the landlord is in love with his land.<BR>
 As the baby is attached to his milk, so the Saint is in love with God. ||2||<BR>
 The scholar is absorbed in scholarship, and the eyes are happy to see.<BR>
 As the tongue savors the tastes, so does the humble servant of the Lord sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 As is the hunger, so is the fulfiller; He is the Lord and Master of all hearts.<BR>
 Nanak thirsts for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan; he has met God, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. ||4||5||16||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 We are filthy, and You are immaculate, O Creator Lord; we are worthless, and You are the Great Giver.<BR>
 We are fools, and You are wise and all-knowing. You are the knower of all things. ||1||<BR>
 O Lord, this is what we are, and this is what You are.<BR>
 We are sinners, and You are the Destroyer of sins. Your abode is so beautiful, O Lord and Master. ||Pause||<BR>
 You fashion all, and having fashioned them, You bless them. You bestow upon them soul, body and the breath of life.<BR>
 We are worthless - we have no virtue at all; please, bless us with Your gift, O Merciful Lordand Master. ||2||<BR>
 You do good for us, but we do not see it as good; You are kind and compassionate, forever and ever.<BR>
 You are the Giver of peace, the Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny; please, save us, Your children! ||3||<BR>
 You are the treasure, eternal Lord King; all beings and creatures beg of You.<BR>
 Says Nanak, such is our condition; please, Lord, keep us on the Path of the Saints. ||4||6||17||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, Second House:<BR>
 In our mother's womb, You blessed us with Your meditative remembrance, and You preserved us there.<BR>
 Through the countless waves of the ocean of fire, please, carry us across and save us, O Savior Lord! ||1||<BR>
 O Lord, You are the Master above my head.<BR>
 Here and hereafter, You alone are my Support. ||Pause||<BR>
 He looks upon the creation like a mountain of gold, and sees the Creator as a blade of grass.<BR>
 You are the Great Giver, and we are all mere beggars; O God, You give gifts according to Your Will. ||2||<BR>
 In an instant, You are one thing, and in another instant, You are another. Wondrous are Your ways!<BR>
 You are beautiful, mysterious, profound, unfathomable, lofty, inaccessible and infinite. ||3||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 020</H2></CENTER>
 When You brought me to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, then I heard the Bani of Your Word.<BR>
 Nanak is in ecstasy, beholding the Glory of the Primal Lord of Nirvaanaa. ||4||7||18||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I am the dust of the feet of the Beloved Saints; I seek the Protection of their Sanctuary.<BR>
 The Saints are my all-powerful Support; the Saints are my ornament and decoration. ||1||<BR>
 I am hand and glove with the Saints.<BR>
 I have realized my pre-ordained destiny.<BR>
 This mind is yours, O Siblings of Destiny. ||Pause||<BR>
 My dealings are with the Saints, and my business is with the Saints.<BR>
 I have earned the profit with the Saints, and the treasure filled to over-flowing with devotion to the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 The Saints entrusted to me the capital, and my mind's delusion was dispelled.<BR>
 What can the Righteous Judge of Dharma do now? All my accounts have been torn up. ||3||<BR>
 I have found the greatest bliss, and I am at peace, by the Grace of the Saints.<BR>
 Says Nanak, my mind is reconciled with the Lord; it is imbued with the wondrous Love of the Lord. ||4||8||19||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 All the things that you see, O man, you shall have to leave behind.<BR>
 Let your dealings be with the Lord's Name, and you shall attain the state of Nirvaanaa. ||1||<BR>
 O my Beloved, You are the Giver of peace.<BR>
 The Perfect Guru has given me these Teachings, and I am attuned to You. ||Pause||<BR>
 In sexual desire, anger, greed, emotional attachment and self-conceit, peace is not to be found.<BR>
 So be the dust of the feet of all, O my mind, and then you shall find bliss, joy and peace. ||2||<BR>
 He knows the condition of your inner self, and He will not let your work go in vain - serve Him, O mind.<BR>
 Worship Him, and dedicate this mind unto Him, the Image of the Undying Lord, the Divine Guru. ||3||<BR>
 He is the Lord of the Universe, the Compassionate Lord, the Supreme Lord God, the Formless Lord.<BR>
 The Naam is my merchandise, the Naam is my nourishment; the Naam, O Nanak, is the Support of my breath of life. ||4||9||20||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 He infuses the breath into the dead bodies, and he reunited the separated ones.<BR>
 Even beasts, demons and fools become attentive listeners, when He sings the Praises of the Lord's Name. ||1||<BR>
 Behold the glorious greatness of the Perfect Guru.<BR>
 His worth cannot be described. ||Pause||<BR>
 He has demolished the abode of sorrow and disease, and brought bliss, joy and happiness.<BR>
 He effortlessly awards the fruits of the mind's desire, and all works are brought to perfection. ||2||<BR>
 He finds peace in this world, and his face is radiant in the world hereafter; his comings and goings are finished.<BR>
 He becomes fearless, and his heart is filled with the Naam, the Name of the Lord; his mind is pleasing to the True Guru. ||3||<BR>
 Standing up and sitting down, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord; his pain, sorrow and doubt are dispelled.<BR>
 Says Nanak, his karma is perfect; his mind is attached to the Guru's feet. ||4||10||21||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Forsaking the jewel, he is attached to the shell; nothing will come of it.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 021</H2></CENTER>
 O my mind, meditate forever on the Perfect, Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Meditate in remembrance on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O mortal.<BR>
 Your frail body shall perish, you ignorant fool. ||Pause||<BR>
 Illusions and dream-objects possess nothing of greatness.<BR>
 Without meditating on the Lord, nothing succeeds, and nothing will go along with you. ||2||<BR>
 Acting in egotism and pride, his life passes away, and he does nothing for his soul.<BR>
 Wandering and wandering all around, he is never satisfied; he does not remember the Name of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 Intoxicated with the taste of corruption, cruel pleasures and countless sins, he is consigned to the cycle of reincarnation.<BR>
 Nanak offers his prayer to God, to eradicate his demerits. ||4||11||22||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Sing the Glorious Praises of the Perfect, Imperishable Lord, and the poison of sexual desire and anger shall be burnt away.<BR>

 The Perfect Guru has dispelled the darkness of doubt.<BR>
 Remember God with love and devotion; He is near at hand. ||Pause||<BR>
 Drink in the sublime essence, the treasure of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and your mind and body shall remain satisfied.<BR>
 The Transcendent Lord is totally permeating and pervading everywhere; where would He come from, and where would He go? ||2||<BR>
 One whose mind is filled with the Lord, is a person of meditation, penance, self-restraint and spiritual wisdom, and a knower of reality.<BR>
 The Gurmukh obtains the jewel of the Naam; his efforts come to perfect fruition. ||3||<BR>
 All his struggles, sufferings and pains are dispelled, and the noose of death is cut away from him.<BR>
 Says Nanak, God has extended His Mercy, and so his mind and body blossom forth. ||4||12||23||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 God is the Doer, the Cause of causes, the Great Giver; God is the Supreme Lord and Master.<BR>
 The Merciful Lord created all beings; God is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. ||1||<BR>

 In God's Sanctuary, all fears depart, suffering disappears, and peace is obtained.<BR>
 When the Supreme Lord God and Master becomes merciful, we meditate on the Perfect True Guru. ||1||<BR>

 By Your Mercy, O God, Merciful to the meek, imbue me with Your Love, that I might sing Your Glorious Praises. ||Pause||<BR>
 The True Guru has implanted the treasure of the Naam within me, and all my anxieties have been dispelled.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 022</H2></CENTER>
 By His Mercy, He has made me His own, and the imperishable Lord has come to dwell within my mind. ||2||<BR>
 No misfortune afflicts one who is protected by the True Guru.<BR>
 The Lotus Feet of God come to abide within his heart, and he savors the sublime essence of the Lord's Ambrosial Nectar. ||3||<BR>
 So, as a servant, serve your God, who fulfills your mind's desires.<BR>
 Slave Nanak is a sacrifice to the Perfect Lord, who has protected and preserved his honor. ||4||14||25||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Infatuated with the darkness of emotional attachment to Maya, he does not know the Lord, the Great Giver.<BR>
 The Lord created his body and fashioned his soul, but he claims that his power is his own. ||1||<BR>
 O foolish mind, God, your Lord and Master is watching over you.<BR>
 Whatever you do, He knows; nothing can remain concealed from Him. ||Pause||<BR>
 You are intoxicated with the tastes of the tongue, with greed and pride; countless sins spring from these.<BR>
 You wandered in pain through countless incarnations, weighed down by the chains of egotism. ||2||<BR>
 Behind closed doors, hidden by many screens, the man takes his pleasure with another man's wife.<BR>
 When Chitr and Gupt, the celestial accountants of the conscious and subconscious, call for your account, who will screen you then? ||3||<BR>
 O Perfect Lord, Merciful to the meek, Destroyer of pain, without You, I have no shelter at all.<BR>
 Please, lift me up out of the world-ocean; O God, I have come to Your Sanctuary. ||4||15||26||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The Supreme Lord God has become my helper and friend; His sermon and the Kirtan of His Praises have brought me peace.<BR>
 Chant the Word of the Perfect Guru's Bani, and be ever in bliss, O mortal. ||1||<BR>
 Remember the True Lord in meditation, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, eternal peace is obtained, and the Lord is never forgotten. ||Pause||<BR>

 One who is blessed with God's Grace - that humble servant becomes immaculate and pure. ||2||<BR>
 Obstacles are removed, and all pains are eliminated; my mind is attached to the Guru's feet.<BR>

 He is imperishable, the Giver of all beings; meditating on Him, all filth is removed.<BR>
 He is the treasure of excellence, the object of His devotees, but rare are those who find Him. ||1||<BR>

 Twenty-four hours a day, he chants the Praises of the Lord, and the bitter poison does not affect him.<BR>
 My Creator Lord has united me with Himself, and the Holy Saints have become my companions. ||3||<BR>
 Taking me by the hand, He has given me everything, and blended me with Himself.<BR>
 Says Nanak, everything has been perfectly resolved; I have found the Perfect True Guru. ||4||15||79||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Humility is my spiked club.<BR>
 My dagger is to be the dust of all men's feet.<BR>
 No evil-doer can withstand these weapons.<BR>
 The Perfect Guru has given me this understanding. ||1||<BR>
 The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is the support and shelter of the Saints.<BR>
 One who remembers the Lord in meditation, is emancipated; millions have been saved in this way. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 In the Society of the Saints, I sing His Praises.<BR>
 I have found this, the perfect wealth of the Lord.<BR>
 Says Nanak, I have eradicated my self-conceit.<BR>
 I see the Supreme Lord God everywhere. ||2||16||80||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The Perfect Guru has done it perfectly.<BR>
 He blessed me with forgiveness.<BR>
 I have found lasting peace and bliss.<BR>
 Everywhere, the people dwell in peace. ||1||<BR>
 Devotional worship to the Lord is what gives rewards.<BR>
 The Perfect Guru, by His Grace, gave it to me; how rare are those who know this. ||Pause||<BR>
 Sing the Word of the Guru's Bani, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 That is always rewarding and peace-giving.<BR>
 Nanak has meditated on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 He has realized his pre-ordained destiny. ||2||17||81||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 035</H2></CENTER>
 I worship and adore the Perfect Guru.<BR>
 All my affairs have been resolved.<BR>
 All desires have been fulfilled.<BR>
 The unstruck melody of the sound current resounds. ||1||<BR>
 O Saints, meditating on the Lord, we obtain peace.<BR>
 In the home of the Saints, celestial peace is pervading; all pain and suffering is dispelled. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Word of the Perfect Guru's Bani<BR>
 is pleasing to the Mind of the Supreme Lord God.<BR>
 Slave Nanak speaks<BR>
 the Unspoken, immaculate sermon of the Lord. ||2||18||82||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The hungry man is not ashamed to eat.<BR>
 Just so, the humble servant of the Lord sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Why are you so lazy in your own affairs?<BR>
 Remembering Him in meditation, your face shall be radiant in the Court of the Lord; you shall find peace, forever and ever. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Just as the lustful man is enticed by lust,<BR>
 so is the Lord's slave pleased with the Lord's Praise. ||2||<BR>
 Just as the mother holds her baby close,<BR>
 so does the spiritual person cherish the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 This is obtained from the Perfect Guru.<BR>
 Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||19||83||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Safe and sound, I have returned home.<BR>
 The slanderer's face is blackened with ashes.<BR>
 The Perfect Guru has dressed in robes of honor.<BR>
 All my pains and sufferings are over. ||1||<BR>
 O Saints, this is the glorious greatness of the True Lord.<BR>
 He has created such wonder and glory! ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I speak according to the Will of my Lord and Master.<BR>
 God's slave chants the Word of His Bani.<BR>
 O Nanak, God is the Giver of peace.<BR>
 He has created the perfect creation. ||2||20||84||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Within my heart, I meditate on God.<BR>
 I have returned home safe and sound.<BR>
 The world has become contented.<BR>
 The Perfect Guru has saved me. ||1||<BR>
 O Saints, my God is forever merciful.<BR>
 The Lord of the world does not call His devotee to account; He protects His children. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I have enshrined the Lord's Name within my heart.<BR>
 He has resolved all my affairs.<BR>
 The Perfect Guru was pleased, and blessed me,<BR>
 and now, Nanak shall never again suffer pain. ||2||21||85||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The Lord abides in my mind and body.<BR>
 Everyone congratulates me on my victory.<BR>
 This is the glorious greatness of the Perfect Guru.<BR>
 His value cannot be described. ||1||<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to Your Name.<BR>
 He alone, whom You have forgiven, O my Beloved, sings Your Praises. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You are my Great Lord and Master.<BR>
 You are the support of the Saints.<BR>
 Nanak has entered God's Sanctuary.<BR>
 The faces of the slanderers are blackened with ashes. ||2||22||86||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Peace in this world, O my friends,<BR>
 and bliss in the world hereafter - God has given me this.<BR>
 The Transcendent Lord has arranged these arrangements;<BR>
 I shall never waver again. ||1||<BR>
 My mind is pleased with the True Lord Master.<BR>
 I know the Lord to be pervading all. ||1||Pause||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 036</H2></CENTER>
 All beings are Yours, O Merciful Lord.<BR>
 You cherish Your devotees.<BR>
 Your glorious greatness is wonderful and marvellous.<BR>
 Nanak ever meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||23||87||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The Lord is always with me.<BR>
 The Messenger of Death does not approach me.<BR>
 God holds me close in His embrace, and protects me.<BR>
 True are the Teachings of the True Guru. ||1||<BR>
 The Perfect Guru has done it perfectly.<BR>
 He has beaten and driven off my enemies, and given me, His slave, the sublime understanding of the neutral mind. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 God has blessed all places with prosperity.<BR>
 I have returned again safe and sound.<BR>
 Nanak has entered God's Sanctuary.<BR>
 It has eradicated all disease. ||2||24||88||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The True Guru is the Giver of all peace and comfort - seek His Sanctuary.<BR>
 Beholding the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, bliss ensues, pain is dispelled, and one sings the Lord's Praises. ||1||<BR>
 Drink in the sublime essence of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 Chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord; worship the Naam in adoration, and enter the Sanctuary of the Perfect Guru. ||Pause||<BR>
 Only one who has such pre-ordained destiny receives it; he alone becomes perfect, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 Nanak's prayer, O Dear God, is to remain lovingly absorbed in the Naam. ||2||25||89||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The Lord is the Cause of Causes, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts; He preserves the honor of His servant.<BR>
 He is hailed and congratulated throughout the world, and he tastes the sublime essence of the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||<BR>
 Dear God, Lord of the world, You are my only support.<BR>
 You are all-powerful, the Giver of Sanctuary; twenty-four hours a day, I meditate on You. ||Pause||<BR>
 That humble being, who vibrates upon You, O God, is not afflicted by anxiety.<BR>
 Attached to the Feet of the True Guru, his fear is dispelled, and within his mind, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 He abides in celestial peace and utter ecstasy; the True Guru has comforted him.<BR>
 He has returned home victorious, with honor, and his hopes have been fulfilled. ||3||<BR>
 Perfect are the Teachings of the Perfect Guru; Perfect are the actions of God.<BR>
 Grasping hold of the Guru's feet, Nanak has crossed over the terrifying world-ocean, chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||4||26||90||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Becoming merciful, the Destroyer of the pains of the poor has Himself devised all devices.<BR>
 In an instant, He has saved His humble servant; the Perfect Guru has cut away his bonds. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, meditate forever on the Guru, the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 All illness shall depart from this body, and you shall obtain the fruits of your mind's desires. ||Pause||<BR>
 God created all beings and creatures; He is lofty, inaccessible and infinite.<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; his face is radiant in the Court of the Lord. ||2||27||91||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I meditate in remembrance on my Lord.<BR>
 Day and night, I ever meditate on Him.<BR>
 He gave me His hand, and protected me.<BR>
 I drink in the most sublime essence of the Lord's Name. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 037</H2></CENTER>
 I am a sacrifice to my Guru.<BR>
 God, the Great Giver, the Perfect One, has become merciful to me, and now, all are kind to me. ||Pause||<BR>
 Servant Nanak has entered His Sanctuary.<BR>
 He has perfectly preserved his honor.<BR>
 All suffering has been dispelled.<BR>
 So enjoy peace, O my Siblings of Destiny! ||2||28||92||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Hear my prayer, O my Lord and Master; all beings and creatures were created by You.<BR>
 You preserve the honor of Your Name, O Lord, Cause of causes. ||1||<BR>
 O Dear God, Beloved, please, make me Your own.<BR>
 Whether good or bad, I am Yours. ||Pause||<BR>
 The Almighty Lord and Master heard my prayer; cutting away my bonds, He has adorned me.<BR>
 He dressed me in robes of honor, and blended His servant with Himself; Nanak is revealed in glory throughout the world. ||2||29||93||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 All beings and creatures are subservient to all those who serve in the Lord's Court.<BR>
 Their God made them His own, and carried them across the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||<BR>
 He resolves all the affairs of His Saints.<BR>
 He is merciful to the meek, kind and compassionate, the ocean of kindness, my Perfect Lord and Master. ||Pause||<BR>
 I am asked to come and be seated, everywhere I go, and I lack nothing.<BR>
 The Lord blesses His humble devotee with robes of honor; O Nanak, the Glory of God is manifest. ||2||30||94||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 O mind, love the Lord.<BR>
 With your ears, hear the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, and with your tongue, sing His song. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and meditate in remembrance on the Lord; even a sinner like yourself will become pure.<BR>
 Death is on the prowl, with its mouth wide open, friend. ||1||<BR>
 Today or tomorrow, eventually it will seize you; understand this in your consciousness.<BR>
 Says Nanak, meditate, and vibrate upon the Lord; this opportunity is slipping away! ||2||1||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 The mind remains in the mind.<BR>
 He does not meditate on the Lord, nor does he perform service at sacred shrines, and so death seizes him by the hair. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Wife, friends, children, carriages, property, total wealth, the entire world<BR>
 - know that all of these things are false. The Lord's meditation alone is true. ||1||<BR>
 Wandering, wandering around for so many ages, he has grown weary, and finally, he obtained this human body.<BR>
 Says Nanak, this is the opportunity to meet the Lord; why don't you remember Him in meditation? ||2||2||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 O mind, what evil-mindedness have you developed?<BR>
 You are engrossed in the pleasures of other men's wives, and slander; you have not worshipped the Lord at all. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You do not know the way to liberation, but you run all around chasing wealth.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 038</H2></CENTER>
 In the end, nothing shall go along with you; you have entrapped yourself in vain. ||1||<BR>
 You have not meditated or vibrated upon the Lord; you have not served the Guru, or His humble servants; spiritual wisdom has not welled up within you.<BR>
 The Immaculate Lord is within your heart, and yet you search for Him in the wilderness. ||2||<BR>
 You have wandered through many many births; you are exhausted but have still not found a way out of this endless cycle.<BR>
 Now that you have obtained this human body, meditate on the Lord's Feet; Nanak advises with this advice. ||3||3||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 O mind, contemplate the Sanctuary of God.<BR>
 Meditating on Him in remembrance, Ganika the prostitute was saved; enshrine His Praises within your heart. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Meditating on Him in remembrance, Dhroo became immortal, and obtained the state of fearlessness.<BR>
 The Lord and Master removes suffering in this way - why have you forgotten Him? ||1||<BR>
 As soon as the elephant took to the protective Sanctuary of the Lord, the ocean of mercy, he escaped from the crocodile.<BR>
 How much can I describe the Glorious Praises of the Naam? Whoever chants the Lord's Name, his bonds are broken. ||2||<BR>
 Ajaamal, known throughout the world as a sinner, was redeemed in an instant.<BR>
 Says Nanak, remember the Chintaamani, the jewel which fulfills all desires, and you too shall be carried across and saved. ||3||4||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 What efforts should the mortal make,<BR>
 to attain devotional worship of the Lord, and eradicate the fear of death? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Which actions, what sort of knowledge, and what religion - what Dharma should one practice?<BR>
 What Name of the Guru should one remember in meditation, to cross over the terrifying world-ocean? ||1||<BR>
 In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Name of the One Lord is the treasure of mercy; chanting it, one obtains salvation.<BR>
 No other religion is comparable to this; so speak the Vedas. ||2||<BR>
 He is beyond pain and pleasure, forever unattached; He is called the Lord of the world.<BR>
 He dwells deep within your inner self, O Nanak, like the image in a mirror. ||3||5||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 O mother, how can I see the Lord of the world?<BR>
 In the utter darkness of emotional attachment and spiritual ignorance, my mind remains entangled. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Deluded by doubt, I have wasted my whole life; I have not obtained a stable intellect.<BR>
 I remain under the influence of corrupting sins, night and day, and I have not renounced wickedness. ||1||<BR>
 I never joined the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and I did not sing the Kirtan of God's Praises.<BR>
 O servant Nanak, I have no virtues at all; keep me in Your Sanctuary, Lord. ||2||6||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 O mother, my mind is out of control.<BR>
 Night and day, it runs after sin and corruption. How can I restrain it? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He listens to the teachings of the Vedas, the Puraanas and the Simritees, but he does not enshrine them in his heart, even for an instant.<BR>
 Engrossed in the wealth and women of others, his life passes away uselessly. ||1||<BR>
 He has gone insane with the wine of Maya, and does not understand even a bit of spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 Deep within his heart, the Immaculate Lord dwells, but he does not know this secret. ||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 039</H2></CENTER>
 When I came to the Sanctuary of the Holy Saints, all my evil-mindedness was dispelled.<BR>
 Then, O Nanak, I remembered the Chintaamani, the jewel which fulfills all desires, and the noose of Death was snapped. ||3||7||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 O man, grasp this Truth firmly in your soul.<BR>
 The whole world is just like a dream; it will pass away in an instant. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Like a wall of sand, built up and plastered with great care, which does not last even a few days,<BR>
 just so are the pleasures of Maya. Why are you entangled in them, you ignorant fool? ||1||<BR>
 Understand this today - it is not yet too late! Chant and vibrate the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Says Nanak, this is the subtle wisdom of the Holy Saints, which I proclaim out loud to you. ||2||8||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 In this world, I have not found any true friend.<BR>
 The whole world is attached to its own pleasures, and when trouble comes, no one is with you. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Wives, friends, children and relatives - all are attached to wealth.<BR>
 When they see a poor man, they all forsake his company and run away. ||1||<BR>
 So what should I say to this crazy mind, which is affectionately attached to them?<BR>
 The Lord is the Master of the meek, the Destroyer of all fears, and I have forgotten to praise Him. ||2||<BR>
 Like a dog's tail, which will never straighten out, the mind will not change, no matter how many things are tried.<BR>
 Says Nanak, please, Lord, uphold the honor of Your innate nature; I chant Your Name. ||3||9||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 O mind, you have not accepted the Guru's Teachings.<BR>
 What is the use of shaving your head, and wearing saffron robes? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Abandoning Truth, you cling to falsehood; your life is uselessly wasting away.<BR>
 Practicing hypocrisy, you fill your belly, and then sleep like an animal. ||1||<BR>
 You do not know the Way of the Lord's meditation; you have sold yourself into Maya's hands.<BR>
 The madman remains entangled in vice and corruption; he has forgotten the jewel of the Naam. ||2||<BR>
 He remains thoughtless, not thinking of the Lord of the Universe; his life is uselessly passing away.<BR>
 Says Nanak, O Lord, please, confirm your innate nature; this mortal is continually making mistakes. ||3||10||<BR>
 Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 That man, who in the midst of pain, does not feel pain,<BR>
 who is not affected by pleasure, affection or fear, and who looks alike upon gold and dust;||1||Pause||<BR>
 Who is not swayed by either slander or praise, nor affected by greed, attachment or pride;<BR>
 who remains unaffected by joy and sorrow, honor and dishonor;||1||<BR>
 who renounces all hopes and desires and remains desireless in the world;<BR>
 who is not touched by sexual desire or anger - within his heart, God dwells. ||2||<BR>
 That man, blessed by Guru's Grace, understands this way.<BR>
 O Nanak, he merges with the Lord of the Universe, like water with water. ||3||11||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 040</H2></CENTER>
 Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 O dear friend, know this in your mind.<BR>
 The world is entangled in its own pleasures; no one is for anyone else. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 In good times, many come and sit together, surrounding you on all four sides.<BR>
 But when hard times come, they all leave, and no one comes near you. ||1||<BR>
 Your wife, whom you love so much, and who has remained ever attached to you,<BR>
 runs away crying, "Ghost! Ghost!", as soon as the swan-soul leaves this body. ||2||<BR>
 This is the way they act - those whom we love so much.<BR>
 At the very last moment, O Nanak, no one is any use at all, except the Dear Lord. ||3||12||139||<BR>
 Sorat'h, First Mehl, First House, Ashtapadees, Chau-Tukas:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 I am not torn by duality, because I do not worship any other than the Lord; I do not visit tombs or crematoriums.<BR>
 I do not enter the houses of strangers, engrossed in desire. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, has satisfied my desires.<BR>
 Deep within my heart, the Guru has shown me the home of my being, and my mind is imbued with peace and poise, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 You Yourself are all-knowing, and You Yourself are all-seeing; You alone bestow intelligence, O Lord. ||1||<BR>
 My mind is detached, imbued with detachment; the Word of the Shabad has pierced my mind, O my mother.<BR>
 God's Light shines continually within the nucleus of my deepest self; I am lovingly attached to the Bani, the Word of the True Lord Master. ||Pause||<BR>
 Countless detached renunciates talk of detachment and renunciation, but he alone is a true renunciate, who is pleasing to the Lord Master.<BR>
 The Word of the Shabad is ever in his heart; he is absorbed in the Fear of God, and he works to serve the Guru.<BR>
 He remembers the One Lord, his mind does not waver, and he restrains its wanderings.<BR>
 He is intoxicated with celestial bliss, and is ever imbued with the Lord's Love; he sings the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. ||2||<BR>
 The mind is like the wind, but if it comes to rest in peace, even for an instant, then he shall abide in the peace of the Name, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 His tongue, eyes and ears are imbued with Truth; O Lord, You quench the fires of desire.<BR>
 In hope, the renunciate remains free of hopes; in the home of his own inner self, he is absorbed in the trance of deep meditation.<BR>
 He remains content, satisfied with the charity of the Naam; he drinks in the Ambrosial Amrit with ease. ||3||<BR>
 There is no renunciation in duality, as long as there is even a particle of duality.<BR>
 The whole world is Yours, Lord; You alone are the Giver. There is not any other, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh dwells in misery forever, while the Lord bestows greatness upon the Gurmukh.<BR>
 God is infinite, endless, inaccessible and unfathomable; His worth cannot be described. ||4||<BR>
 The consciousness in deep Samaadhi, the Supreme Being, the Lord of the three worlds - these are Your Names, Lord.<BR>
 The creatures born into this world have their destiny inscribed upon their foreheads; they experience according to their destinies.<BR>
 The Lord Himself causes them to do good and bad deeds; He Himself makes them steadfast in devotional worship.<BR>
 The filth of their mind and mouth is washed off when they live in the Fear of God; the inaccessible Lord Himself blesses them with spiritual wisdom. ||5||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 041</H2></CENTER>
 Only those who taste it know its sweet taste, like the mute, who eats the candy, and only smiles.<BR>
 How can I describe the indescribable, O Siblings of Destiny? I shall follow His Will forever.<BR>
 If one meets with the Guru, the Generous Giver, then he understands; those who have no Guru cannot understand this.<BR>
 As the Lord causes us to act, so do we act, O Siblings of Destiny. What other clever tricks can anyone try? ||6||<BR>
 Some are deluded by doubt, while others are imbued with devotional worship; Your play is infinite and endless.<BR>
 As You engage them, they receive the fruits of their rewards; You alone are the One who issues Your Commands.<BR>
 I would serve You, if anything were my own; my soul and body are Yours.<BR>
 One who meets with the True Guru, by His Grace, takes the Support of the Ambrosial Naam. ||7||<BR>
 He dwells in the heavenly realms, and his virtues radiantly shine forth; meditation and spiritual wisdom are found in virtue.<BR>
 The Naam is pleasing to his mind; he speaks it, and causes others to speak it as well. He speaks the essential essence of wisdom.<BR>
 The Word of the Shabad is his Guru and spiritual teacher, profound and unfathomable; without the Shabad, the world is insane.<BR>
 He is a perfect renunciate, naturally at ease, O Nanak, whose mind is pleased with the True Lord. ||8||1||<BR>
 Sorat'h, First Mehl, Ti-Tukas:<BR>
 Hope and desire are entrapments, O Siblings of Destiny. Religious rituals and ceremonies are traps.<BR>
 Because of good and bad deeds, one is born into the world, O Siblings of Destiny; forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he is ruined.<BR>
 This Maya is the enticer of the world, O Siblings of Destiny; all such actions are corrupt. ||1||<BR>
 Listen, O ritualistic Pandit:<BR>
 that religious ritual which produces happiness, O Siblings of Destiny, is contemplation of the essence of the soul. ||Pause||<BR>
 You may stand and recite the Shaastras and the Vedas, O Siblings of Destiny, but these are just worldly actions.<BR>
 Filth cannot be washed away by hypocrisy, O Siblings of Destiny; the filth of corruption and sin is within you.<BR>
 This is how the spider is destroyed, O Siblings of Destiny, by falling head-long in its own web. ||2||<BR>
 So many are destroyed by their own evil-mindedness, O Siblings of Destiny; in the love of duality, they are ruined.<BR>
 Without the True Guru, the Name is not obtained, O Siblings of Destiny; without the Name, doubt does not depart.<BR>
 If one serves the True Guru, then he obtains peace, O Siblings of Destiny; his comings and goings are ended. ||3||<BR>
 True celestial peace comes from the Guru, O Siblings of Destiny; the immaculate mind is absorbed into the True Lord.<BR>
 One who serves the Guru, understands, O Siblings of Destiny; without the Guru, the way is not found.<BR>
 What can anyone do, with greed within? O Siblings of Destiny, by telling lies, they eat poison. ||4||<BR>
 O Pandit, by churning cream, butter is produced.<BR>
 By churning water, you shall only see water, O Siblings of Destiny; this world is like that.<BR>
 Without the Guru, he is ruined by doubt, O Siblings of Destiny; the unseen Divine Lord is in each and every heart. ||5||<BR>
 This world is like a thread of cotton, O Siblings of Destiny, which Maya has tied on all ten sides.<BR>
 Without the Guru, the knots cannot be untied, O Siblings of Destiny; I am so tired of religious rituals.<BR>
 This world is deluded by doubt, O Siblings of Destiny; no one can say anything about it. ||6||<BR>
 Meeting with the Guru, the Fear of God comes to abide in the mind; to die in the Fear of God is one's true destiny.<BR>
 In the Court of the Lord, the Naam is far superior to ritualistic cleansing baths, charity and good deeds, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 042</H2></CENTER>
 One who implants the Naam within himself, through the Guru's halter - O Siblings of Destiny, the Lord dwells in his mind, and he is free of hypocrisy. ||7||<BR>
 This body is the jeweller's shop, O Siblings of Destiny; the incomparable Naam is the merchandise.<BR>
 The merchant secures this merchandise, O Siblings of Destiny, by contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 Blessed is the merchant, O Nanak, who meets the Guru, and engages in this trade. ||8||2||<BR>
 Sorat'h, First Mehl:<BR>
 Those who serve the True Guru, O Beloved, their companions are saved as well.<BR>
 No one blocks their way, O Beloved, and the Lord's Ambrosial Nectar is on their tongue.<BR>
 Without the Fear of God, they are so heavy that they sink and drown, O Beloved; but the Lord, casting His Glance of Grace, carries them across. ||1||<BR>
 I ever praise You, O Beloved, I ever sing Your Praises.<BR>
 Without the boat, one is drowned in the sea of fear, O Beloved; how can I reach the distant shore? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I praise the Praiseworthy Lord, O Beloved; there is no other one to praise.<BR>
 Those who praise my God are good, O Beloved; they are imbued with the Word of the Shabad, and His Love.<BR>
 If I join them, O Beloved, I can churn the essence and so find joy. ||2||<BR>
 The gateway to honor is Truth, O Beloved; it bears the Insignia of the True Name of the Lord.<BR>
 We come into the world, and we depart, with our destiny written and pre-ordained, O Beloved; realize the Command of the Commander.<BR>
 Without the Guru, this Command is not understood, O Beloved; True is the Power of the True Lord. ||3||<BR>
 By His Command, we are conceived, O Beloved, and by His Command, we grow in the womb.<BR>
 By His Command, we are born, O Beloved, head-first, and upside-down.<BR>
 The Gurmukh is honored in the Court of the Lord, O Beloved; he departs after resolving his affairs. ||4||<BR>
 By His Command, one comes into the world, O Beloved, and by His Will, he goes.<BR>
 By His Will, some are bound and gagged and driven away, O Beloved; the self-willed manmukhs suffer their punishment.<BR>
 By His Command, the Word of the Shabad, is realized, O Beloved, and one goes to the Court of the Lord robed in honor. ||5||<BR>
 By His Command, some accounts are accounted for, O Beloved; by His Command, some suffer in egotism and duality.<BR>
 By His Command, one wanders in reincarnation, O Beloved; deceived by sins and demerits, he cries out in his suffering.<BR>
 If he comes to realize the Command of the Lord's Will, O Beloved, then he is blessed with Truth and Honor. ||6||<BR>
 It is so difficult to speak it, O Beloved; how can we speak, and hear, the True Name?<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to those who praise the Lord, O Beloved.<BR>
 I have obtained the Name, and I am satisfied, O Beloved; by His Grace, I am united in His Union. ||7||<BR>
 If my body were to become the paper, O Beloved, and my mind the inkpot;<BR>
 and if my tongue became the pen, O Beloved, I would write, and contemplate, the Glorious Praises of the True Lord.<BR>
 Blessed is that scribe, O Nanak, who writes the True Name, and enshrines it within his heart. ||8||3||<BR>
 Sorat'h, First Mehl, Du-Tukas:<BR>
 You are the Giver of virtue, O Immaculate Lord, but my mind is not immaculate, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 I am a worthless sinner, O Siblings of Destiny; virtue is obtained from You alone, Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O my Beloved Creator Lord, You create, and You behold.<BR>
 I am a hypocritical sinner, O Siblings of Destiny. Bless my mind and body with Your Name, O Lord. ||Pause||<BR>

 If man loves the Lord with detachment, O Siblings of Destiny, he is judged to be true and infallible in the Lord's court and home. ||3||<BR>
 You are pervading the realms of the underworld and the heavenly skies; Your wisdom and glories are in each and every heart.<BR>
 Meeting with the Guru, one finds peace, O Siblings of Destiny, and pride is dispelled from the mind. ||4||<BR>
 Scrubbing with water, the body can be cleaned, O Siblings of Destiny, but the body becomes dirty again.<BR>
 Bathing in the supreme essence of spiritual wisdom, O Siblings of Destiny, the mind and body become pure. ||5||<BR>
 Why worship gods and goddesses, O Siblings of Destiny? What can we ask of them? What can they give us?<BR>
 The stone gods are washed with water, O Siblings of Destiny, but they just sink in the water. ||6||<BR>
 Without the Guru, the unseen Lord cannot be seen, O Siblings of Destiny; the world is drowning, having lost its honor.<BR>
 Greatness is in the hands of my Lord and Master, O Siblings of Destiny; as He is pleased, He gives. ||7||<BR>

 A large pile of firewood, O Siblings of Destiny, will burn if a small fire is applied.<BR>

 Sorat'h, Third Mehl, First House, Ti-Tukas:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 You always preserve the honor of Your devotees, O Dear Lord; You have protected them from the very beginning of time.<BR>
 You protected Your servant Prahlaad, O Dear Lord, and annihilated Harnaakhash.<BR>
 The Gurmukhs place their faith in the Dear Lord, but the self-willed manmukhs are deluded by doubt. ||1||<BR>
 O Dear Lord, this is Your Glory.<BR>
 You preserve the honor of Your devotees, O Lord Master; Your devotees seek Your Sanctuary. ||Pause||<BR>
 The Messenger of Death cannot touch Your devotees; death cannot even approach them.<BR>
 The Name of the Lord alone abides in their minds; through the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they find liberation.<BR>
 Wealth and all the spiritual powers of the Siddhis fall at the feet of the Lord's devotees; they obtain peace and poise from the Guru. ||2||<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs have no faith; they are filled with greed and self-interest.<BR>
 They are not Gurmukh - they do not understand the Word of the Shabad in their hearts; they do not love the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Their masks of falsehood and hypocrisy shall fall off; the self-willed manmukhs speak with insipid words. ||3||<BR>
 You are pervading through Your devotees, O Dear God; through Your devotees, You are known.<BR>
 All the people are enticed by Maya; they are Yours, Lord - You alone are the Architect of Destiny.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 044</H2></CENTER>
 Overcoming my egotism and quieting the desires within my mind, I have come to realize the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||4||<BR>
 God automatically does the work of those who love the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, he ever dwells in their minds, and He resolves all their affairs.<BR>
 Whoever challenges them is destroyed; they have the Lord God as their Savior. ||5||<BR>
 Without serving the True Guru, no one finds the Lord; the self-willed manmukhs die crying out in pain.<BR>
 They come and go, and find no place of rest; in pain and suffering, they perish.<BR>
 But one who becomes Gurmukh drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar, and is easily absorbed in the True Name. ||6||<BR>
 Without serving the True Guru, one cannot escape reincarnation, even by performing numerous rituals.<BR>
 Those who read the Vedas, and argue and debate without the Lord, lose their honor.<BR>
 True is the True Guru, and True is the Word of His Bani; in the Guru's Sanctuary, one is saved. ||7||<BR>
 Those whose minds are filled with the Lord are judged as true in the Court of the Lord; they are hailed as true in the True Court.<BR>

 He has given me the treasure of the Naam; O Siblings of Destiny, through the Guru's Teachings, I am absorbed in celestial bliss. ||4||<BR>

 Serve the True Guru forever, O Siblings of Destiny, and eradicate self-conceit from within. ||5||<BR>
 Under Guru's Instruction, the Fear of God is produced, O Siblings of Destiny; true and excellent are the deeds done in the Fear of God.<BR>

 She who does not know the Will of her Husband Lord, O Siblings of Destiny, is an ill-mannered and bitter bride.<BR>
 She does things with a stubborn mind, O Siblings of Destiny; without the Name, she is false. ||3||<BR>
 They alone sing the Lord's Praises, who have such pre-ordained destiny written upon their foreheads, O Siblings of Destiny; through the Love of the True Lord, they find detachment.<BR>

 In this life, she has not focused her consciousness on the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny; how can she show her face when she leaves?<BR>
 In spite of the warning calls which were sounded, she has been plundered, O Siblings of Destiny; she yearned only for corruption. ||7||<BR>

 We are saved by following those, O Beloved, who seek the Sanctuary of the True Lord. ||2||<BR>
 He thinks that his food is so sweet, O Beloved, but it makes his body ill.<BR>
 It turns out to be bitter, O Beloved, and it produces only sadness.<BR>
 The Lord leads him astray in the enjoyment of pleasures, O Beloved, and so his sense of separation does not depart.<BR>
 Those who meet the Guru are saved, O Beloved; this is their pre-ordained destiny. ||3||<BR>
 He is filled with longing for Maya, O Beloved, and so the Lord does not ever come into his mind.<BR>
 Those who forget You, O Supreme Lord Master, their bodies turn to dust.<BR>
 They cry out and scream horribly, O Beloved, but their torment does not end.<BR>
 Those who meet the Guru, and reform themselves, O Beloved, their capital remains intact. ||4||<BR>
 As far as possible, do not associate with the faithless cynics, O Beloved.<BR>
 Meeting with them, the Lord is forgotten, O Beloved, and you rise and depart with a blackened face.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh finds no rest or shelter, O Beloved; in the Court of the Lord, they are punished.<BR>
 Those who meet with the Guru, and reform themselves, O Beloved, their affairs are resolved. ||5||<BR>
 One may have thousands of clever tricks and techniques of austere self-discipline, O Beloved, but not even one of them will go with him.<BR>
 Those who turn their backs on the Lord of the Universe, O Beloved, their families are stained with disgrace.<BR>
 They do not realize that they do have Him , O Beloved; falsehood will not go with them.<BR>

 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 They read scriptures, and contemplate the Vedas; they practice the inner cleansing techniques of Yoga, and control of the breath.<BR>
 But they cannot escape from the company of the five passions; they are increasingly bound to egotism. ||1||<BR>
 O Beloved, this is not the way to meet the Lord; I have performed these rituals so many times.<BR>
 I have collapsed, exhausted, at the Door of my Lord Master; I pray that He may grant me a discerning intellect. ||Pause||<BR>
 One may remain silent and use his hands as begging bowls, and wander naked in the forest.<BR>
 He may make pilgrimages to river banks and sacred shrines all over the world, but his sense of duality will not leave him. ||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 048</H2></CENTER>
 His mind's desires may lead him to go and dwell at sacred places of pilgrimage, and offer his head to be sawn off;<BR>
 but this will not cause the filth of his mind to depart, even though he may make thousands of efforts. ||3||<BR>
 He may give gifts of all sorts - gold, women, horses and elephants.<BR>
 He may make offerings of corn, clothes and land in abundance, but this will not lead him to the Lord's Door. ||4||<BR>
 He may remain devoted to worship and adoration, bowing his forehead to the floor, practicing the six religious rituals.<BR>
 He indulges in egotism and pride, and falls into entanglements, but he does not meet the Lord by these devices. ||5||<BR>
 He practices the eighty-four postures of Yoga, and acquires the supernatural powers of the Siddhas, but he gets tired of practicing these.<BR>
 He lives a long life, but is reincarnated again and again; he has not met with the Lord. ||6||<BR>
 He may enjoy princely pleasures, and regal pomp and ceremony, and issue unchallenged commands.<BR>
 He may lie on beautiful beds, perfumed with sandalwood oil, but this will led him only to the gates of the most horrible hell. ||7||<BR>
 Singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is the highest of all actions.<BR>
 Says Nanak, he alone obtains it, who is pre-destined to receive it. ||8||<BR>
 Your slave is intoxicated with this Love of Yours.<BR>

 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
 Sorat'h is always beautiful, if it brings the True Lord to dwell in the mind of the soul-bride.<BR>
 Her teeth are clean and her mind is not split by duality; the Name of the True Lord is on her tongue.<BR>
 Here and hereafter, she abides in the Fear of God, and serves the True Guru without hesitation.<BR>
 Discarding worldly adornments, she meets her Husband Lord, and she celebrates joyfully with Him.<BR>
 She is adorned forever with the Name in her mind, and she does not have even an iota of filth.<BR>
 Her husband's younger and elder brothers, the corrupt desires, have died, suffering in pain; and now, who fears Maya, the mother-in-law?<BR>
 If she becomes pleasing to her Husband Lord, O Nanak, she bears the jewel of good karma upon her forehead, and everything is Truth to her. ||1||<BR>
 Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 Sorat'h is beautiful only when it leads the soul-bride to seek the Lord's Name.<BR>
 She pleases her Guru and God; under Guru's Instruction, she speaks the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 She is attracted to the Lord's Name, day and night, and her body is drenched in the color of the Love of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 No other being like the Lord God can be found; I have looked and searched over the whole world.<BR>
 The Guru, the True Guru, has implanted the Naam within me; my mind does not waver any more.<BR>
 Servant Nanak is the Lord's slave, the slave of the slaves of the Guru, the True Guru. ||2||<BR>

 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 In the flames of egotism, he is burnt to death; he wanders in doubt and the love of duality.<BR>
 The Perfect True Guru saves him, making him His own.<BR>
 This world is burning; through the Sublime Word of the Guru's Shabad, this comes to be seen.<BR>
 Those who are attuned to the Shabad are cooled and soothed; O Nanak, they practice Truth. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 Service to the True Guru is fruitful and rewarding; blessed and acceptable is such a life.<BR>
 Those who do not forget the True Guru, in life and in death, are truly wise people.<BR>
 Their families are saved, and they are approved by the Lord.<BR>
 The Gurmukhs are approved in death as in life, while the self-willed manmukhs continue the cycle of birth and death.<BR>
 O Nanak, they are not described as dead, who are absorbed in the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Serve the Immaculate Lord God, and meditate on the Lord's Name.<BR>
 Join the Society of the Holy Saints, and be absorbed in the Lord's Name.<BR>
 O Lord, glorious and great is service to You; I am so foolish<BR>

 As Gurmukh, I shall serve You, as Guru has instructed me. ||2||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 He acts according to pre-ordained destiny, written by the Creator Himself.<BR>
 Emotional attachment has drugged him, and he has forgotten the Lord, the treasure of virtue.<BR>
 Don't think that he is alive in the world - he is dead, through the love of duality.<BR>
 Those who do not meditate on the Lord, as Gurmukh, are not permitted to sit near the Lord.<BR>
 They suffer the most horrible pain and suffering, and neither their sons nor their wives go along with them.<BR>
 Their faces are blackened among men, and they sigh in deep regret.<BR>
 No one places any reliance in the self-willed manmukhs; trust in them is lost.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukhs live in absolute peace; the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides within them. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 They alone are relatives, and they alone are friends, who, as Gurmukh, join together in love.<BR>
 Night and day, they act according to the True Guru's Will; they remain absorbed in the True Name.<BR>
 Those who are attached to the love of duality are not called friends; they practice egotism and corruption.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs are selfish; they cannot resolve anyone's affairs.<BR>
 O Nanak, they act according to their pre-ordained destiny; no one can erase it. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 You Yourself created the world, and You Yourself arranged the play of it.<BR>
 You Yourself created the three qualities, and fostered emotional attachment to Maya.<BR>
 He is called to account for his deeds done in egotism; he continues coming and going in reincarnation.<BR>
 The Guru instructs those whom the Lord Himself blesses with Grace.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to my Guru; forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to Him. ||3||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The love of Maya is enticing; without teeth, it has eaten up the world.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs are eaten away, while the Gurmukhs are saved; they focus their consciousness on the True Name.<BR>
 Without the Name, the world wanders around insane; the Gurmukhs come to see this.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 050</H2></CENTER>
 Involved in worldly affairs, he wastes his life in vain; the peace-giving Lord does not come to abide in his mind.<BR>
 O Nanak, they alone obtain the Name, who have such pre-ordained destiny. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 The home within is filled with Ambrosial Nectar, but the self-willed manmukh does not get to taste it.<BR>
 He is like the deer, who does not recognize its own musk-scent; it wanders around, deluded by doubt.<BR>
 The manmukh forsakes the Ambrosial Nectar, and instead gathers poison; the Creator Himself has fooled him.<BR>
 How rare are the Gurmukhs, who obtain this understanding; they behold the Lord God within themselves.<BR>
 Their minds and bodies are cooled and soothed, and their tongues enjoy the sublime taste of the Lord.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Shabad, the Name wells up; through the Shabad, we are united in the Lord's Union.<BR>
 Without the Shabad, the whole world is insane, and it loses its life in vain.<BR>
 The Shabad alone is Ambrosial Nectar; O Nanak, the Gurmukhs obtain it. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The Lord God is inaccessible; tell me, how can we find Him?<BR>
 He has no form or feature, and He cannot be seen; tell me, how can we meditate on Him?<BR>
 The Lord is formless, immaculate and inaccessible; which of His Virtues should we speak of and sing?<BR>
 They alone walk on the Lord's Path, whom the Lord Himself instructs.<BR>
 The Perfect Guru has revealed Him to me; serving the Guru, He is found. ||4||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 It is as if my body has been crushed in the oil-press, without yielding even a drop of blood;<BR>
 it is as if my soul has been cut apart into pieces for the sake of the Love of the True Lord;<BR>
 O Nanak, still, night and day, my Union with the Lord is not broken. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 My Friend is so full of joy and love; He colors my mind with the color of His Love,<BR>
 like the fabric which is treated to retain the color of the dye.<BR>
 O Nanak, this color does not depart, and no other color can be imparted to this fabric. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The Lord Himself is pervading everywhere; the Lord Himself causes us to chant His Name.<BR>
 The Lord Himself created the creation; He commits all to their tasks.<BR>
 He engages some in devotional worship, and others, He causes to stray.<BR>
 He places some on the Path, while He leads others into the wilderness.<BR>
 Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; as Gurmukh, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||5||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Service to the True Guru is fruitful and rewarding, if one performs it with his mind focused on it.<BR>
 The fruits of the mind's desires are obtained, and egotism departs from within.<BR>
 His bonds are broken, and he is liberated; he remains absorbed in the True Lord.<BR>
 It is so difficult to obtain the Naam in this world; it comes to dwell in the mind of the Gurmukh.<BR>
 O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to one who serves his True Guru. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 The mind of the self-willed manmukh is so very stubborn; it is stuck in the love of duality.<BR>
 He does not find peace, even in dreams; he passes his life in misery and suffering.<BR>
 The Pandits have grown weary of going door to door, reading and reciting their scriptures; the Siddhas have gone into their trances of Samaadhi.<BR>
 This mind cannot be controlled; they are tired of performing religious rituals.<BR>
 The impersonators have grown weary of wearing false costumes, and bathing at the sixty-eight sacred shrines.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 051</H2></CENTER>
 They do not know the state of their own minds; they are deluded by doubt and egotism.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, the Fear of God is obtained; by great good fortune, the Lord comes to abide in the mind.<BR>

 This shall be God's determination in His True Court; servant Nanak predicts and proclaims this. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The True Guru has established the village; the Guru has appointed its guards and protectors.<BR>
 My hopes are fulfilled, and my mind is imbued with the love of the Guru's Feet.<BR>
 The Guru is infinitely merciful; He has erased all my sins.<BR>
 The Guru has showered me with His Mercy, and He has made me His own.<BR>
 Nanak is forever a sacrifice to the Guru, who has countless virtues. ||27||<BR>
 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
 By His Command, we receive our pre-ordained rewards; so what can we do now, O Pandit?<BR>
 When His Command is received, then it is decided; all beings move and act accordingly. ||1||<BR>
 Second Mehl:<BR>
 The string through the nose is in the hands of the Lord Master; one's own actions drive him on.<BR>
 Wherever his food is, there he eats it; O Nanak, this is the Truth. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The Lord Himself puts everything in its proper place.<BR>
 He Himself created the creation, and He Himself destroys it.<BR>
 He Himself fashions His creatures, and He Himself nourishes them.<BR>
 He hugs His slaves close in His embrace, and blesses them with His Glance of Grace.<BR>
 O Nanak, His devotees are forever in bliss; they have burnt away the love of duality. ||28||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 O mind, meditate on the Dear Lord, with single-minded conscious concentration.<BR>
 The glorious greatness of the Lord shall last forever and ever; He never regrets what He gives.<BR>
 I am forever a sacrifice to the Lord; serving Him, peace is obtained.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh remains merged with the Lord; he burns away his ego through the Word of the Shabad. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 He Himself enjoins us to serve Him, and He Himself blesses us with forgiveness.<BR>
 He Himself is the father and mother of all; He Himself cares for us.<BR>
 O Nanak, those who meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abide in the home of their inner being; they are honored throughout the ages. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 You are the Creator, all-powerful, able to do anything. Without You, there is no other at all.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 060</H2></CENTER>
 You Yourself created the world, and You Yourself shall destroy it in the end.<BR>
 The Word of Your Shabad alone is pervading everywhere; whatever You do, comes to pass.<BR>
 God blesses the Gurmukh with glorious greatness, and then, he finds the Lord.<BR>
 As Gurmukh, Nanak worships and adores the Lord; let everyone proclaim, "Blessed, blessed, blessed is He, the Guru!"||29||1||SUDH||<BR>
 Raag Sorat'h, The Word Of Devotee Kabeer Jee, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Worshipping their idols, the Hindus die; the Muslims die bowing their heads.<BR>
 The Hindus cremate their dead, while the Muslims bury theirs; neither finds Your true state, Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O mind, the world is a deep, dark pit.<BR>
 On all four sides, Death has spread his net. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Reciting their poems, the poets die; the mystical ascetics die while journeying to Kaydaar Naat'h.<BR>
 The Yogis die, with their matted hair, but even they do not find Your state, Lord. ||2||<BR>
 The kings die, gathering and hoarding their money, burying great quantities of gold.<BR>
 The Pandits die, reading and reciting the Vedas; women die, gazing at their own beauty. ||3||<BR>
 Without the Lord's Name, all come to ruin; behold, and know this, O body.<BR>
 Without the Name of the Lord, who can find salvation? Kabeer speaks the Teachings. ||4||1||<BR>
 When the body is burnt, it turns to ashes; if it is not cremated, then it is eaten by armies of worms.<BR>
 The unbaked clay pitcher dissolves, when water is poured into it; this is also the nature of the body. ||1||<BR>
 Why, O Siblings of Destiny, do you strut around, all puffed up with pride?<BR>
 Have you forgotten those days, when you were hanging, face down, for ten months? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Like the bee which collects honey, the fool eagerly gathers and collects wealth.<BR>
 At the time of death, they shout, "Take him away, take him away! Why leave a ghost lying around?"||2||<BR>
 His wife accompanies him to the threshold, and his friends and companions beyond.<BR>
 All the people and relatives go as far as the cremation grounds, and then, the soul-swan goes on alone. ||3||<BR>
 Says Kabeer, listen, O mortal being: you have been seized by Death, and you have fallen into the deep, dark pit.<BR>
 You have entangled yourself in the false wealth of Maya, like the parrot caught in the trap. ||4||2||<BR>
 Listening to all the teachings of the Vedas and the Puraanas, I wanted to perform the religious rituals.<BR>
 But seeing all the wise men caught by Death, I arose and left the Pandits; now I am free of this desire. ||1||<BR>
 O mind, you have not completed the only task you were given;<BR>
 you have not meditated on the Lord, your King. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Going to the forests, they practice Yoga and deep, austere meditation; they live on roots and the fruits they gather.<BR>
 The musicians, the Vedic scholars, the chanters of one word and the men of silence, all are listed on the Register of Death. ||2||<BR>
 Loving devotional worship does not enter into your heart; pampering and adorning your body, you must still give it up.<BR>
 You sit and play music, but you are still a hypocrite; what do you expect to receive from the Lord? ||3||<BR>
 Death has fallen on the whole world; the doubting religious scholars are also listed on the Register of Death.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 061</H2></CENTER>
 Says Kabeer, those humble people become pure - they become Khalsa - who know the Lord's loving devotional worship. ||4||3||<BR>
 SECOND HOUSE||<BR>
 With both of my eyes, I look around;<BR>
 I don't see anything except the Lord.<BR>
 My eyes gaze lovingly upon Him,<BR>
 and now, I cannot speak of anything else. ||1||<BR>
 My doubts were removed, and my fear ran away,<BR>
 when my consciousness became attached to the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 When the magician beats his tambourine,<BR>
 everyone comes to see the show.<BR>
 When the magician winds up his show,<BR>
 then he enjoys its play all alone. ||2||<BR>
 By preaching sermons, one's doubt is not dispelled.<BR>
 Everyone is tired of preaching and teaching.<BR>
 The Lord causes the Gurmukh to understand;<BR>
 his heart remains permeated with the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 When the Guru grants even a bit of His Grace,<BR>
 one's body, mind and entire being are absorbed into the Lord.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, I am imbued with the Lord's Love;<BR>
 I have met with the Life of the world, the Great Giver. ||4||4||<BR>
 Let the sacred scriptures be your milk and cream,<BR>
 and the ocean of the mind the churning vat.<BR>
 Be the butter-churner of the Lord,<BR>
 and your buttermilk shall not be wasted. ||1||<BR>
 O soul-bride slave, why don't you take the Lord as your Husband?<BR>
 He is the Life of the world, the Support of the breath of life. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The chain is around your neck, and the cuffs are on your feet.<BR>
 The Lord has sent you wandering around from house to house.<BR>
 And still, you do not meditate on the Lord, O soul-bride, slave.<BR>
 Death is watching you, O wretched woman. ||2||<BR>
 The Lord God is the Cause of causes.<BR>
 What is in the hands of the poor soul-bride, the slave?<BR>
 She awakens from her slumber,<BR>
 and she becomes attached to whatever the Lord attaches her. ||3||<BR>
 O soul-bride, slave, where did you obtain that wisdom,<BR>
 by which you erased your inscription of doubt?<BR>
 Kabeer has tasted that subtle essence;<BR>
 by Guru's Grace, his mind is reconciled with the Lord. ||4||5||<BR>
 Without Him, we cannot even live;<BR>
 when we meet Him, then our task is completed.<BR>
 People say it is good to live forever,<BR>
 but without dying, there is no life. ||1||<BR>
 So now, what sort wisdom should I contemplate and preach?<BR>
 As I watch, worldly things dissipate. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Saffron is ground up, and mixed with sandalwood;<BR>
 without eyes, the world is seen.<BR>
 The son has given birth to his father;<BR>
 without a place, the city has been established. ||2||<BR>
 The humble beggar has found the Great Giver,<BR>
 but he is unable to eat what he has been given.<BR>
 He cannot leave it alone, but it is never exhausted.<BR>
 He shall not go to beg from others any longer. ||3||<BR>
 Those select few, who know how to die while yet alive, enjoy great peace.<BR>
 Kabeer has found that wealth;<BR>
 meeting with the Lord, he has erased his self-conceit. ||4||6||<BR>
 What use is it to read, and what use is it to study?<BR>
 What use is it to listen to the Vedas and the Puraanas?<BR>
 What use is reading and listening,<BR>
 if celestial peace is not attained? ||1||<BR>
 The fool does not chant the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 So what does he think of, over and over again? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 In the darkness, we need a lamp<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 062</H2></CENTER>
 to find the incomprehensible thing.<BR>
 I have found this incomprehensible thing;<BR>
 my mind is illuminated and enlightened. ||2||<BR>
 Says Kabeer, now I know Him;<BR>
 since I know Him, my mind is pleased and appeased.<BR>
 My mind is pleased and appeased, and yet, people do not believe it.<BR>
 They do not believe it, so what can I do? ||3||7||<BR>
 In his heart there is deception, and yet in his mouth are words of wisdom.<BR>
 You are false - why are you churning water? ||1||<BR>
 Why do you bother to wash your body?<BR>
 Your heart is still full of filth. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The gourd may be washed at the sixty-eight sacred shrines,<BR>
 but even then, its bitterness is not removed. ||2||<BR>
 Says Kabeer after deep contemplation,<BR>
 please help me cross over the terrifying world-ocean, O Lord, O Destroyer of ego. ||3||8||<BR>
 Sorat'h:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Practicing great hypocrisy, he acquires the wealth of others.<BR>
 Returning home, he squanders it on his wife and children. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, do not practice deception, even inadvertently.<BR>
 In the end, your own soul shall have to answer for its account. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Moment by moment, the body is wearing away, and old age is asserting itself.<BR>
 And then, when you are old, no one shall pour water into your cup. ||2||<BR>
 Says Kabeer, no one belongs to you.<BR>
 Why not chant the Lord's Name in your heart, when you are still young? ||3||9||<BR>
 O Saints, my windy mind has now become peaceful and still.<BR>
 It seems that I have learned something of the science of Yoga. ||Pause||<BR>
 The Guru has shown me the hole,<BR>
 through which the deer carefully enters.<BR>
 I have now closed off the doors,<BR>
 and the unstruck celestial sound current resounds. ||1||<BR>
 The pitcher of my heart-lotus is filled with water;<BR>
 I have spilled out the water, and set it upright.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, the Lord's humble servant, this I know.<BR>
 Now that I know this, my mind is pleased and appeased. ||2||10||<BR>
 Raag Sorat'h:<BR>
 I am so hungry, I cannot perform devotional worship service.<BR>
 Here, Lord, take back Your mala.<BR>
 I beg for the dust of the feet of the Saints.<BR>
 I do not owe anyone anything. ||1||<BR>
 O Lord, how can I be with You?<BR>
 If You do not give me Yourself, then I shall beg until I get You. ||Pause||<BR>
 I ask for two kilos of flour,<BR>
 and half a pound of ghee, and salt.<BR>
 I ask for a pound of beans,<BR>
 which I shall eat twice a day. ||2||<BR>
 I ask for a cot, with four legs,<BR>
 and a pillow and mattress.<BR>
 I ask for a quit to cover myself.<BR>
 Your humble servant shall perform Your devotional worship service with love. ||3||<BR>
 I have no greed;<BR>
 Your Name is the only ornament I wish for.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, my mind is pleased and appeased;<BR>
 now that my mind is pleased and appeased, I have come to know the Lord. ||4||11||<BR>
 Raag Sorat'h, The Word Of Devotee Naam Dayv Jee, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 When I see Him, I sing His Praises.<BR>
 Then I, his humble servant, become patient. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 063</H2></CENTER>
 Meeting the Divine True Guru, I merge into the sound current of the Naad. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Where the dazzling white light is seen,<BR>
 there the unstruck sound current of the Shabad resounds.<BR>
 One's light merges in the Light;<BR>
 by Guru's Grace, I know this. ||2||<BR>
 The jewels are in the treasure chamber of the heart-lotus.<BR>
 They sparkle and glitter like lightning.<BR>
 The Lord is near at hand, not far away.<BR>
 He is totally permeating and pervading in my soul. ||3||<BR>
 Where the light of the undying sun shines,<BR>
 the light of burning lamps seems insignificant.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, I know this.<BR>
 Servant Naam Dayv is absorbed in the Celestial Lord. ||4||1||<BR>
 FOURTH HOUSE, SORAT'H:<BR>
 The woman next door asked Naam Dayv, "Who built your house?<BR>
 I shall pay him double wages. Tell me, who is your carpenter?"||1||<BR>
 O sister, I cannot give this carpenter to you.<BR>
 Behold, my carpenter is pervading everywhere.<BR>
 My carpenter is the Support of the breath of life. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 This carpenter demands the wages of love, if someone wants Him to build their house.<BR>
 When one breaks his ties with all the people and relatives, then the carpenter comes of His own accord. ||2||<BR>
 I cannot describe such a carpenter, who is contained in everything, everywhere.<BR>
 The mute tastes the most sublime ambrosial nectar, but if you ask him to describe it, he cannot. ||3||<BR>
 Listen to the virtues of this carpenter, O sister; He stopped the oceans, and established Dhroo as the pole star.<BR>
 Naam Dayv's Lord Master brought Sita back, and gave Sri Lanka to Bhabheekhan. ||4||2||<BR>
 SORAT'H, THIRD HOUSE:<BR>
 The skinless drum plays.<BR>
 Without the rainy season, the clouds shake with thunder.<BR>
 Without clouds, the rain falls,<BR>
 if one contemplates the essence of reality. ||1||<BR>
 I have met my Beloved Lord.<BR>
 Meeting with Him, my body is made beauteous and sublime. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Touching the philosopher's stone, I have been transformed into gold.<BR>
 I have threaded the jewels into my mouth and mind.<BR>
 I love Him as my own, and my doubt has been dispelled.<BR>
 Seeking the Guru's guidance, my mind is content. ||2||<BR>
 The water is contained within the pitcher;<BR>
 I know that the One Lord is contained in all.<BR>
 The mind of the disciple has faith in the Guru.<BR>
 Servant Naam Dayv understands the essence of reality. ||3||3||<BR>
 Raag Sorat'h, The Word Of Devotee Ravi Daas Jee:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 When I am in my ego, then You are not with me. Now that You are with me, there is no egotism within me.<BR>
 The wind may raise up huge waves in the vast ocean, but they are just water in water. ||1||<BR>
 O Lord, what can I say about such an illusion?<BR>
 Things are not as they seem. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 It is like the king, who falls asleep upon his throne, and dreams that he is a beggar.<BR>
 His kingdom is intact, but separated from it, he suffers in sorrow. Such is my own condition. ||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 064</H2></CENTER>
 Like the story of the rope mistaken for a snake, the mystery has now been explained to me.<BR>
 Like the many bracelets, which I mistakenly thought were gold; now, I do not say what I said then. ||3||<BR>
 The One Lord is pervading the many forms; He enjoys Himself in all hearts.<BR>
 Says Ravi Daas, the Lord is nearer than our own hands and feet. Whatever will be, will be. ||4||1||<BR>
 If I am bound by the noose of emotional attachment, then I shall bind You, Lord, with the bonds of love.<BR>
 Go ahead and try to escape, Lord; I have escaped by worshipping and adoring You. ||1||<BR>
 O Lord, You know my love for You.<BR>
 Now, what will You do? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 A fish is caught, cut up, and cooked it in many different ways.<BR>
 Bit by bit, it is eaten, but still, it does not forget the water. ||2||<BR>
 The Lord, our King, is father to no one, except those who love Him.<BR>
 The veil of emotional attachment has been cast over the entire world, but it does not bother the Lord's devotee. ||3||<BR>
 Says Ravi Daas, my devotion to the One Lord is increasing; now, who can I tell this to?<BR>
 That which brought me to worship and adore You - I am still suffering that pain. ||4||2||<BR>
 I obtained this precious human life as a reward for my past actions, but without discriminating wisdom, it is wasted in vain.<BR>
 Tell me, without devotional worship of the Lord, of what use are mansions and thrones like those of King Indra? ||1||<BR>
 You have not considered the sublime essence of the Name of the Lord, our King;<BR>
 this sublime essence shall cause you to forget all other essences. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 We do not know what we need to know, and we have become insane. We do not consider what we should consider; our days are passing away.<BR>
 Our passions are strong, and our discriminating intellect is weak; we have no access to the supreme objective. ||2||<BR>
 We say one thing, and do something else; entangled in endless Maya, we do not understand anything.<BR>
 Says Ravi Daas, Your slave, O Lord, I am disillusioned and detached; please, spare me Your anger, and have mercy on my soul. ||3||3||<BR>
 He is the ocean of peace; the miraculous tree of life, the wish-fulfilling jewel, and the Kaamadhayna, the cow which fulfills all desires, all are in His power.<BR>
 The four great blessings, the eighteen supernatural spiritual powers of the Siddhas, and the nine treasures, are all in the palm of His hand. ||1||<BR>
 You do not chant with your tongue the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har.<BR>
 Abandon your involvement in all other words. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The various Shaastras, Puranaas, and the Vedas of Brahma, are made up of thirty-four letters.<BR>
 After deep contemplation, Vyaas spoke of the supreme objective; there is nothing equal to the Lord's Name. ||2||<BR>
 Very fortunate are those who are absorbed in celestial bliss, and released from their entanglements; they are lovingly attached to the Lord.<BR>
 Says Ravi Daas, enshrine the Lord's Light within your heart, and your fear of birth and death shall run away from you. ||3||4||<BR>
 If You are the mountain, Lord, then I am the peacock.<BR>
 If You are the moon, then I am the partridge in love with it. ||1||<BR>
 O Lord, if You will not break with me, then I will not break with You.<BR>
 For, if I were to break with You, with whom would I then join? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 If You are the lamp, then I am the wick.<BR>
 If You are the sacred place of pilgrimage, then I am the pilgrim. ||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 13 - Raag Sorat'h - Part 065</H2></CENTER>
 I am joined in true love with You, Lord.<BR>
 I am joined with You, and I have broken with all others. ||3||<BR>
 Wherever I go, there I serve You.<BR>
 There is no other Lord Master than You, O Divine Lord. ||4||<BR>
 Meditating, vibrating upon You, the noose of death is cut away.<BR>
 To attain devotional worship, Ravi Daas sings to You, Lord. ||5||5||<BR>
 The body is a wall of water, supported by the pillars of air; the egg and sperm are the mortar.<BR>
 The framework is made up of bones, flesh and veins; the poor soul-bird dwells within it. ||1||<BR>
 O mortal, what is mine, and what is yours?<BR>
 The soul is like a bird perched upon a tree. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You lay the foundation and build the walls.<BR>
 But in the end, three and a half cubits will be your measured space. ||2||<BR>
 You make your hair beautiful, and wear a stylish turban on your head.<BR>
 But in the end, this body shall be reduced to a pile of ashes. ||3||<BR>
 Your palaces are lofty, and your brides are beautiful.<BR>
 But without the Lord's Name, you shall lose the game entirely. ||4||<BR>
 My social status is low, my ancestry is low, and my life is wretched.<BR>
 I have come to Your Sanctuary, O Luminous Lord, my King; so says Ravi Daas, the shoemaker. ||5||6||<BR>
 I am a shoemaker, but I do not know how to mend shoes.<BR>
 People come to me to mend their shoes. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I have no awl to stitch them;<BR>
 I have no knife to patch them. ||1||<BR>
 Mending, mending, people waste their lives and ruin themselves.<BR>
 Without wasting my time mending, I have found the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Ravi Daas chants the Lord's Name;<BR>
 he is not concerned with the Messenger of Death. ||3||7||<BR>
 Raag Sorat'h, The Word Of Devotee Bheekhan Jee:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Tears well up in my eyes, my body has become weak, and my hair has become milky-white.<BR>
 My throat is tight, and I cannot utter even one word; what can I do now? I am a mere mortal. ||1||<BR>
 O Lord, my King, Gardener of the world-garden, be my Physician,<BR>
 and save me, Your Saint. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 My head aches, my body is burning, and my heart is filled with anguish.<BR>
 Such is the disease that has struck me; there is no medicine to cure it. ||2||<BR>
 The Name of the Lord, the ambrosial, immaculate water, is the best medicine in the world.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, says servant Bheekhan, I have found the Door of Salvation. ||3||1||<BR>
 Such is the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the invaluable jewel, the most sublime wealth, which I have found through good deeds.<BR>
 By various efforts, I have enshrined it within my heart; this jewel cannot be hidden by hiding it. ||1||<BR>
 The Glorious Praises of the Lord cannot be spoken by speaking.<BR>
 They are like the sweet candies given to a mute. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The tongue speaks, the ears listen, and the mind contemplates the Lord; they find peace and comfort.<BR>
 Says Bheekhan, my eyes are content; wherever I look, there I see the Lord. ||2||2||<BR>
