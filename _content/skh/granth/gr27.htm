<CENTER><H2>Section 27 - Raag Kaydaaraa - Part 001</H2></CENTER>
 Kaydaaraa, Fourth Mehl, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 O my mind, sing continually the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 The Inaccessible, Unfathomable Lord cannot be seen; meeting with the Perfect Guru, He is seen. ||Pause||<BR>
 That person, upon whom my Lord and Master showers His Mercy - the Lord attunes that one to Himself.<BR>
 Everyone worships the Lord, but only that person who is pleasing to the Lord is accepted. ||1||<BR>
 The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is priceless. It rests with the Lord. If the Lord bestows it, then we meditate on the Naam.<BR>
 That person, whom my Lord and Master blesses with His Name - his entire account is forgiven. ||2||<BR>
 Those humble beings who worship and adore the Lord's Name, are said to be blessed. Such is the good destiny written on their foreheads.<BR>
 Gazing upon them, my mind blossoms forth, like the mother who meets with her son and hugs him close. ||3||<BR>
 I am a child, and You, O my Lord God, are my Father; please bless me with such understanding, that I may find the Lord.<BR>
 Like the cow, which is happy upon seeing her calf, O Lord, please hug Nanak close in Your Embrace. ||4||1||<BR>
 Kaydaaraa, Fourth Mehl, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 O my mind, chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 Wash the Feet of the True Guru, and worship them. In this way, you shall find my Lord God. ||Pause||<BR>
 Sexual desire, anger, greed, attachment, egotism and corrupt pleasures - stay away from these.<BR>
 Join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and speak with the Holy People about the Lord. The Love of the Lord is the healing remedy; the Name of the Lord is the healing remedy. Chant the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 27 - Raag Kaydaaraa - Part 002</H2></CENTER>
 So you think that the egotistical pride in power which you harbor deep within is everything. Let it go, and restrain your self-conceit.<BR>
 Please be kind to servant Nanak, O Lord, my Lord and Master; please make him the dust of the Feet of the Saints. ||2||1||2||<BR>
 Kaydaaraa, Fifth Mehl, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 O mother, I have awakened in the Society of the Saints.<BR>
 Seeing the Love of my Beloved, I chant His Name, the greatest treasure||Pause||<BR>
 I am so thirsty for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. my eyes are focused on Him;<BR>
 I have forgotten other thirsts. ||1||<BR>
 Now, I have found my Peace-giving Guru with ease; seeing His Darshan, my mind clings to Him.<BR>
 Seeing my Lord, joy has welled up in my mind; O Nanak, the speech of my Beloved is so sweet! ||2||1||<BR>
 Kaydaaraa, Fifth Mehl, Third House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Please listen to the prayers of the humble, O Merciful Lord.<BR>
 The five thieves and the three dispositions torment my mind.<BR>
 O Merciful Lord, Master of the masterless, please save me from them. ||Pause||<BR>
 I make all sorts of efforts and go on pilgrimages;<BR>
 I perform the six rituals, and meditate in the right way.<BR>
 I am so tired of making all these efforts, but the horrible demons still do not leave me. ||1||<BR>
 I seek Your Sanctuary, and bow to You, O Compassionate Lord.<BR>
 You are the Destroyer of fear, O Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har.<BR>
 You alone are Merciful to the meek.<BR>
 Nanak takes the Support of God's Feet.<BR>
 I have been rescued from the ocean of doubt,<BR>
 holding tight to the feet and the robes of the Saints. ||2||1||2||<BR>
 Kaydaaraa, Fifth Mehl, Fourth House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 I have come to Your Sanctuary, O Lord, O Supreme Treasure.<BR>
 Love for the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is enshrined within my mind; I beg for the gift of Your Name. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 O Pefect Transcendent Lord, Giver of Peace, please grant Your Grace and save my honor.<BR>
 Please bless me with such love, O my Lord and Master, that in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I may chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord with my tongue. ||1||<BR>
 O Lord of the World, Merciful Lord of the Universe, Your sermon and spiritual wisdom are immaculate and pure.<BR>
 Please attune Nanak to Your Love, O Lord, and focus his meditation on Your Lotus Feet. ||2||1||3||<BR>
 Kaydaaraa, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 My mind yearns for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.<BR>
 Please grant Your Grace, and unite me with the Society of the Saints; please bless me with Your Name. ||Pause||<BR>
 I serve my True Beloved Lord. Wherever I hear His Praise, there my mind is in ecstasy.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 27 - Raag Kaydaaraa - Part 003</H2></CENTER>
 I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, forever devoted to You. Your place is incomparably beautiful! ||1||<BR>
 You cherish and nurture all; You take care of all, and Your shade covers all.<BR>
 You are the Primal Creator, the God of Nanak; I behold You in each and every heart. ||2||2||4||<BR>
 Kaydaaraa, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I love the Love of my Beloved.<BR>
 My mind is intoxicated with delight, and my consciousness is filled with hope; my eyes are drenched with Your Love. ||Pause||<BR>
 Blessed is that day, that hour, minute and second when the heavy, rigid shutters are opened, and desire is quenched.<BR>
 Seeing the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, I live. ||1||<BR>
 What is the method, what is the effort, and what is the service, which inspires me to contemplate You?<BR>
 Abandon your egotistical pride and attachment; O Nanak, you shall be saved in the Society of the Saints. ||2||3||5||<BR>
 Kaydaaraa, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, Har.<BR>
 Have Mercy on me, O Life of the World, O Lord of the Universe, that I may chant Your Name. ||Pause||<BR>
 Please lift me up, God, out of vice and corruption, and attach my mind to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<BR>
 Doubt, fear and attachment are eradicated from that person who follows the Guru's Teachings, and gazes on the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. ||1||<BR>
 Let my mind become the dust of all; may I abandon my egotistical intellect.<BR>
 Please bless me with Your devotional worship, O Merciful Lord; by great good fortune, O Nanak, I have found the Lord. ||2||4||6||<BR>
 Kaydaaraa, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Without the Lord, life is useless.<BR>
 Those who forsake the Lord, and become engrossed in other pleasures - false and useless are the clothes they wear, and the food they eat. ||Pause||<BR>
 The pleasures of wealth, youth, property and comforts will not stay with you, O mother.<BR>
 Seeing the mirage, the madman is entangled in it; he is imbued with pleasures that pass away, like the shade of a tree. ||1||<BR>
 Totally intoxicated with the wine of pride and attachment, he has fallen into the pit of sexual desire and anger.<BR>
 O Dear God, please be the Help and Support of servant Nanak; please take me by the hand, and uplift me. ||2||5||7||<BR>
 Kaydaaraa, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Nothing goes along with the mortal, except for the Lord.<BR>
 He is the Master of the meek, the Lord of Mercy, my Lord and Master, the Master of the masterless. ||Pause||<BR>
 Children, possessions and the enjoyment of corrupt pleasures do not go along with the mortal on the path of Death.<BR>
 Singing the Glorious Praises of the treasure of the Naam, and the Lord of the Universe, the mortal is carried across the deep ocean. ||1||<BR>
 In the Sanctuary of the All-powerful, Indescribable, Unfathomable Lord, meditate in remembrance on Him, and your pains shall vanish.<BR>
 Nanak longs for the dust of the feet of the Lord's humble servant; he shall obtain it only if such pre-ordained destiny is written on his forehead. ||2||6||8||<BR>
 Kaydaaraa, Fifth Mehl, Fifth House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 I do not forget the Lord in my mind.<BR>
 This love has now become very strong; it has burnt away other corruption. ||Pause||<BR>
 How can the rainbird forsake the rain-drop? The fish cannot survive without water, even for an instant.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 27 - Raag Kaydaaraa - Part 004</H2></CENTER>
 My tongue chants the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the World; this has become part of my very nature. ||1||<BR>
 The deer is fascinated by the sound of the bell, and so it is shot with the sharp arrow.<BR>
 God's Lotus Feet are the Source of Nectar; O Nanak, I am tied to them by a knot. ||2||1||9||<BR>
 Kaydaaraa, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 My Beloved dwells in the cave of my heart.<BR>
 Shatter the wall of doubt, O my Lord and Master; please grab hold of me, and lift me up towards Yourself. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The world-ocean is so vast and deep; please be kind, lift me up and place me on the shore.<BR>
 In the Society of the Saints, the Lord's Feet are the boat to carry us across. ||1||<BR>
 The One who placed you in the womb of your mother's belly - no one else shall save you in the wilderness of corruption.<BR>
 The power of the Lord's Sanctuary is all-powerful; Nanak does not rely on any other. ||2||2||10||<BR>
 Kaydaaraa, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 With your tongue, chant the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Chanting the Glorious Praises of the Lord, day and night, your sins shall be eradicated. ||Pause||<BR>
 You shall have to leave behind all your riches when you depart. Death is hanging over your head - know this well!<BR>
 Transitory attachments and evil hopes are false. Surely you must believe this! ||1||<BR>
 Within your heart, focus your meditation on the True Primal Being, Akaal Moorat, the Undying Form.<BR>
 Only this profitable merchandise, the treasure of the Naam, O Nanak, shall be accepted. ||2||3||11||<BR>
 Kaydaaraa, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I take only the Support of the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Suffering and conflict do not afflict me; I deal only with the Society of the Saints. ||Pause||<BR>
 Showering His Mercy on me, the Lord Himself has saved me, and no evil thoughts arise within me.<BR>
 Whoever receives this Grace, contemplates Him in meditation; he is not burned by the fire of the world. ||1||<BR>
 Peace, joy and bliss come from the Lord, Har, Har. God's Feet are sublime and excellent.<BR>
 Slave Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary; he is the dust of the feet of Your Saints. ||2||4||12||<BR>
 Kaydaaraa, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Without the Name of the Lord, one's ears are cursed.<BR>
 Those who forget the Embodiment of Life - what is the point of their lives? ||Pause||<BR>
 One who eats and drinks countless delicacies is no more than a donkey, a beast of burden.<BR>
 Twenty-four hours a day, he endures terrible suffering, like the bull, chained to the oil-press. ||1||<BR>
 Forsaking the Life of the World, and attached to another, they weep and wail in so many ways.<BR>
 With his palms pressed together, Nanak begs for this gift; O Lord, please keep me strung around Your Neck. ||2||5||13||<BR>
 Kaydaaraa, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I take the dust of the feet of the Saints and apply it to my face.<BR>
 Hearing of the Imperishable, Eternally Perfect Lord, pain does not afflict me, even in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. ||Pause||<BR>
 Through the Guru's Word, all affairs are resolved, and the mind is not tossed about here and there.<BR>
 Whoever sees the One God to be pervading in all the many beings, does not burn in the fire of corruption. ||1||<BR>
 The Lord grasps His slave by the arm, and his light merges into the Light.<BR>
 Nanak, the orphan, has come seeking the Sanctuary of God's Feet; O Lord, he walks with You. ||2||6||14||<BR>
 Kaydaaraa, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 27 - Raag Kaydaaraa - Part 005</H2></CENTER>
 My mind is filled with yearning for the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 I am totally filled with tranquility and bliss; the burning desire within has been quenched. ||Pause||<BR>
 Walking on the path of the Saints, millions of mortal sinners have been saved.<BR>
 One who applies the dust of the feet of the humble to his forehead, is purified, as if he has bathed at countless sacred shrines. ||1||<BR>
 Meditating on His Lotus Feet deep within, one realizes the Lord and Master in each and every heart.<BR>
 In the Sanctuary of the Divine, Infinite Lord, Nanak shall never again be tortured by the Messenger of Death. ||2||7||15||<BR>
 Kaydaaraa Chhant, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Please meet me, O my Dear Beloved. ||Pause||<BR>
 He is All-pervading amongst all, the Architect of Destiny.<BR>
 The Lord God has created His Path, which is known in the Society of the Saints.<BR>
 The Creator Lord, the Architect of Destiny, is known in the Society of the Saints; You are seen in each and every heart.<BR>
 One who comes to His Sanctuary, finds absolute peace; not even a bit of his work goes unnoticed.<BR>
 One who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the Treasure of Virtue, is easily, naturally intoxicated with the supreme, sublime essence of divine love.<BR>
 Slave Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary; You are the Perfect Creator Lord, the Architect of Destiny. ||1||<BR>
 The Lord's humble servant is pierced through with loving devotion to Him; where else can he go?<BR>
 The fish cannot endure separation, and without water, it will die.<BR>
 Without the Lord, how can I survive? How can I endure the pain? I am like the rainbird, thirsty for the rain-drop.<BR>
 "When will the night pass?," asks the chakvi bird. "I shall find peace only when the rays of the sun shine on me."<BR>
 My mind is attached to the Blessed Vision of the Lord. Blessed are the nights and days, when I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord,<BR>
 Slave Nanak utters this prayer; without the Lord, how can the breath of life continue to flow through me? ||2||<BR>
 Without the breath, how can the body obtain glory and fame?<BR>
 Without the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, the humble, holy person does not find peace, even for an instant.<BR>
 Those who are without the Lord suffer in hell; my mind is pierced through with the Lord's Feet.<BR>
 The Lord is both sensual and unattached; lovingly attune yourself to the Naam, the Name of the Lord. No one can ever deny Him.<BR>
 Go and meet with the Lord, and dwell in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; no one can contain that peace within his being.<BR>
 Please be kind to me, O Lord and Master of Nanak, that I may merge in You. ||3||<BR>
 Searching and searching, I have met with my Lord God, who has showered me with His Mercy.<BR>
 I am unworthy, a lowly orphan, but He does not even consider my faults.<BR>
 He does not consider my faults; He has blessed me with Perfect Peace. It is said that it is His Way to purify us.<BR>
 Hearing that He is the Love of His devotees, I have grasped the hem of His robe. He is totally permeating each and every heart.<BR>
 I have found the Lord, the Ocean of Peace, with intuitive ease; the pains of birth and death are gone.<BR>
 Taking him by the hand, the Lord has saved Nanak, His slave; He has woven the garland of His Name into his heart. ||4||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 27 - Raag Kaydaaraa - Part 006</H2></CENTER>
 Raag Kaydaaraa, The Word Of Kabeer Jee:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Those who ignore both praise and slander, who reject egotistical pride and conceit,<BR>
 who look alike upon iron and gold - they are the very image of the Lord God. ||1||<BR>
 Hardly anyone is a humble servant of Yours, O Lord.<BR>
 Ignoring sexual desire, anger, greed and attachment, such a person becomes aware of the Lord's Feet. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Raajas, the quality of energy and activity; Taamas, the quality of darkness and inertia; and Satvas, the quality of purity and light, are all called the creations of Maya, Your illusion.<BR>
 That man who realizes the fourth state - he alone obtains the supreme state. ||2||<BR>
 Amidst pilgrimages, fasting, rituals, purification and self-discipline, he remains always without thought of reward.<BR>
 Thirst and desire for Maya and doubt depart, remembering the Lord, the Supreme Soul. ||3||<BR>
 When the temple is illuminated by the lamp, its darkness is dispelled.<BR>
 The Fearless Lord is All-pervading. Doubt has run away, says Kabeer, the Lord's humble slave. ||4||1||<BR>
 Some deal in bronze and copper, some in cloves and betel nuts.<BR>
 The Saints deal in the Naam, the Name of the Lord of the Universe. Such is my merchandise as well. ||1||<BR>
 I am a trader in the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 The priceless diamond has come into my hands. I have left the world behind. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 When the True Lord attached me, then I was attached to Truth. I am a trader of the True Lord.<BR>
 I have loaded the commodity of Truth; It has reached the Lord, the Treasurer. ||2||<BR>
 He Himself is the pearl, the jewel, the ruby; He Himself is the jeweller.<BR>
 He Himself spreads out in the ten directions. The Merchant is Eternal and Unchanging. ||3||<BR>
 My mind is the bull, and meditation is the road; I have filled my packs with spiritual wisdom, and loaded them on the bull.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints: my merchandise has reached its destination! ||4||2||<BR>
 You barbaric brute, with your primitive intellect - reverse your breath and turn it inward.<BR>
 Let your mind be intoxicated with the stream of Ambrosial Nectar which trickles down from the furnace of the Tenth Gate. ||1||<BR>
 O Siblings of Destiny, call on the Lord.<BR>
 O Saints, drink in this wine forever; it is so difficult to obtain, and it quenches your thirst so easily. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 In the Fear of God, is the Love of God. Only those few who understand His Love obtain the sublime essence of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 As many hearts as there are - in all of them, is His Ambrosial Nectar; as He pleases, He causes them to drink it in. ||2||<BR>
 There are nine gates to the one city of the body; restrain your mind from escaping through them.<BR>
 When the knot of the three qualities is untied, then the Tenth Gate opens up, and the mind is intoxicated, O Siblings of Destiny. ||3||<BR>
 When the mortal fully realizes the state of fearless dignity, then his sufferings vanish; so says Kabeer after careful deliberation.<BR>
 Turning away from the world, I have obtained this wine, and I am intoxicated with it. ||4||3||<BR>
 You are engrossed with unsatisfied sexual desire and unresolved anger; you do not know the State of the One Lord.<BR>
 Your eyes are blinded, and you see nothing at all. You drown and die without water. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 27 - Raag Kaydaaraa - Part 007</H2></CENTER>
 Why do you walk in that crooked, zig-zag way?<BR>
 You are nothing more than a bundle of bones, wrapped in skin, filled with manure; you give off such a rotten smell! ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You do not meditate on the Lord. What doubts have confused and deluded you? Death is not far away from you!<BR>
 Making all sorts of efforts, you manage to preserve this body, but it shall only survive until its time is up. ||2||<BR>
 By one's own efforts, nothing is done. What can the mere mortal accomplish?<BR>
 When it pleases the Lord, the mortal meets the True Guru, and chants the Name of the One Lord. ||3||<BR>
 You live in a house of sand, but you still puff up your body - you ignorant fool!<BR>
 Says Kabeer, those who do not remember the Lord may be very clever, but they still drown. ||4||4||<BR>
 Your turban is crooked, and you walk crooked; and now you have started chewing betel leaves.<BR>
 You have no use at all for loving devotional worship; you say you have business in court. ||1||<BR>
 In your egotistical pride, you have forgotten the Lord.<BR>
 Gazing upon your gold, and your very beautiful wife, you believe that they are permanent. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You are engrossed in greed, falsehood, corruption and great arrogance. Your life is passing away.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, at the very last moment, death will come and seize you, you fool! ||2||5||<BR>
 The mortal beats the drum for a few days, and then he must depart.<BR>
 With so much wealth and cash and buried treasure, still, he cannot take anything with him. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Sitting on the threshhold, his wife weeps and wails; his mother accompanies him to the outer gate.<BR>
 All the people and relatives together go to the crematorium, but the swan-soul must go home all alone. ||1||<BR>
 Those children, that wealth, that city and town - he shall not come to see them again.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, why do you not meditate on the Lord? Your life is uselessly slipping away! ||2||6||<BR>
 Raag Kaydaaraa, The Word Of Ravi Daas Jee:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 One who performs the six religious rituals and comes from a good family, but who does not have devotion to the Lord in his heart,<BR>
 one who does not appreciate talk of the Lord's Lotus Feet, is just like an outcaste, a pariah. ||1||<BR>
 Be conscious, be conscious, be conscious, O my unconscious mind.<BR>
 Why do you not look at Baalmeek?<BR>
 From such a low social status, what a high status he obtained! Devotional worship to the Lord is sublime! ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The killer of dogs, the lowest of all, was lovingly embraced by Krishna.<BR>
 See how the poor people praise him! His praise extends throughout the three worlds. ||2||<BR>
 Ajaamal, Pingulaa, Lodhia and the elephant went to the Lord.<BR>
 Even such evil-minded beings were emancipated. Why should you not also be saved, O Ravi Daas? ||3||1||<BR>
