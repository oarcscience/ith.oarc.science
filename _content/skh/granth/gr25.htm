<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 001</H2></CENTER>
 Raag Maaroo, First Mehl, First House, Chau-Padas:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<BR>
 Shalok:<BR>
 O my Friend, I shall forever remain the dust of Your feet.<BR>
 Nanak seeks Your protection, and beholds You ever-present, here and now. ||1||<BR>
 SHABAD:<BR>
 Those who receive the call in the last hours of the night, chant the Name of their Lord and Master.<BR>
 Tents, canopies, pavilions and carriages are prepared and made ready for them.<BR>
 You send out the call, Lord, to those who meditate on Your Name. ||1||<BR>
 Father, I am unfortunate, a fraud.<BR>
 I have not found Your Name; my mind is blind and deluded by doubt. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I have enjoyed the tastes, and now my pains have come to fruition; such is my pre-ordained destiny, O my mother.<BR>
 Now my joys are few, and my pains are many. In utter agony, I pass my life. ||2||<BR>
 What separation could be worse than separation from the Lord? For those who are united with Him, what other union can there be?<BR>
 Praise the Lord and Master, who, having created this play, beholds it. ||3||<BR>
 By good destiny, this union comes about; this body enjoys its pleasures.<BR>
 Those who have lost their destiny, suffer separation from this union. O Nanak, they may still be united once again! ||4||1||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 The union of the mother and father brings the body into being.<BR>
 The Creator inscribes upon it the inscription of its destiny.<BR>
 According to this inscription, gifts, light and glorious greatness are received.<BR>
 Joining with Maya, the spiritual consciousness is lost. ||1||<BR>
 O foolish mind, why are you so proud?<BR>
 You shall have to arise and depart when it pleases your Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Abandon the tastes of the world, and find intuitive peace.<BR>
 All must abandon their worldly homes; no one remains here forever.<BR>
 Eat some, and save the rest,<BR>
 if you are destined to return to the world again. ||2||<BR>
 He adorns his body and ress in silk robes.<BR>
 He issues all sorts of commands.<BR>
 Preparing his comfortable bed, he sleeps.<BR>
 When he falls into the hands of the Messenger of Death, what good does it do to cry out? ||3||<BR>
 Household affairs are whirlpools of entanglements, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 002</H2></CENTER>
 Sin is a stone which does not float.<BR>
 So let the Fear of God be the boat to carry your soul across.<BR>
 Says Nanak, rare are those who are blessed with this Boat. ||4||2||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl, First House:<BR>
 Actions are the paper, and the mind is the ink; good and bad are both recorded upon it.<BR>
 As their past actions drive them, so are mortals driven. There is no end to Your Glorious Virtues, Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Why do you not keep Him in your consciousness, you mad man?<BR>
 Forgetting the Lord, your own virtues shall rot away. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The night is a net, and the day is a net; there are as many traps as there are moments.<BR>
 With relish and delight, you continually bite at the bait; you are trapped, you fool - how will you ever escape? ||2||<BR>
 The body is a furnace, and the mind is the iron within it; the five fires are heating it.<BR>
 Sin is the charcoal placed upon it, which burns the mind; the tongs are anxiety and worry. ||3||<BR>
 What was turned to slag is again transformed into gold, if one meets with the Guru.<BR>
 He blesses the mortal with the Ambrosial Name of the One Lord, and then, O Nanak, the body is held steady. ||4||3||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 In the pure, immaculate waters, both the lotus and the slimy scum are found.<BR>
 The lotus flower is with the scum and the water, but it remains untouched by any pollution. ||1||<BR>
 You frog, you will never understand.<BR>
 You eat the dirt, while you dwell in the immaculate waters. You know nothing of the ambrosial nectar there. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You dwell continually in the water; the bumble bee does not dwell there, but it is intoxicated with its fragrance from afar.<BR>
 Intuitively sensing the moon in the distance, the lotus bows its head. ||2||<BR>
 The realms of nectar are irrigated with milk and honey; you think you are clever to live in the water.<BR>
 You can never escape your own inner tendencies, like the love of the flea for blood. ||3||<BR>
 The fool may live with the Pandit, the religious scholar, and listen to the Vedas and the Shaastras.<BR>
 You can never escape your own inner tendencies, like the crooked tail of the dog. ||4||<BR>
 Some are hypocrites; they do not merge with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Some are absorbed in the Feet of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 The mortals obtain what they are predestined to receive; O Nanak, with your tongue, chant the Naam. ||5||4||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl,<BR>
 Shalok:<BR>
 Countless sinners are sanctified, attaching their minds to the Feet of the Lord.<BR>
 The merits of the sixty-eight places of pilgrimage are found in God's Name, O Nanak, when such destiny is inscribed upon one's forehead. ||1||<BR>
 SHABAD:<BR>
 O friends and companions, so puffed up with pride,<BR>
 listen to this one joyous story of your Husband Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Who can I tell about my pain, O my mother?<BR>
 Without the Lord, my soul cannot survive; how can I comfort it, O my mother? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I am a dejected, discarded bride, totally miserable.<BR>
 I have lost my youth; I regret and repent. ||2||<BR>
 You are my wise Lord and Master, above my head.<BR>
 I serve You as Your humble slave. ||3||<BR>
 Nanak humbly prays, this is my only concern:<BR>
 without the Blessed Vision of my Beloved, how can I enjoy Him? ||4||5||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 003</H2></CENTER>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 I am Your slave, Your bonded servant, and so I am called fortunate.<BR>
 I sold myself at Your store in exchange for the Guru's Word; whatever You link me to, to that I am linked. ||1||<BR>
 What cleverness can Your servant try with You?<BR>
 O my Lord and Master, I cannot carry out the Hukam of Your Command. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 My mother is Your slave, and my father is Your slave; I am the child of Your slaves.<BR>
 My slave mother dances, and my slave father sings; I practice devotional worship to You, O my Sovereign Lord. ||2||<BR>
 If You wish to drink, then I shall get water for You; if You wish to eat, I shall grind the corn for You.<BR>
 I wave the fan over You, and wash Your feet, and continue to chant Your Name. ||3||<BR>
 I have been untrue to myself, but Nanak is Your slave; please forgive him, by Your glorious greatness.<BR>
 Since the very beginning of time, and throughout the ages, You have been the merciful and generous Lord. Without You, liberation cannot be attained. ||4||6||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 Some call him a ghost; some say that he is a demon.<BR>
 Some call him a mere mortal; O, poor Nanak! ||1||<BR>
 Crazy Nanak has gone insane, after his Lord, the King.<BR>
 I know of none other than the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He alone is known to be insane, when he goes insane with the Fear of God.<BR>
 He recognizes none other than the One Lord and Master. ||2||<BR>
 He alone is known to be insane, if he works for the One Lord.<BR>
 Recognizing the Hukam, the Command of his Lord and Master, what other cleverness is there? ||3||<BR>
 He alone is known to be insane, when he falls in love with his Lord and Master.<BR>
 He sees himself as bad, and all the rest of the world as good. ||4||7||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 This wealth is all-pervading, permeating all.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh wanders around, thinking that it is far away. ||1||<BR>
 That commodity, the wealth of the Naam, is within my heart.<BR>
 Whoever You bless with it, is emancipated. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 This wealth does not burn; it cannot be stolen by a thief.<BR>
 This wealth does not drown, and its owner is never punished. ||2||<BR>
 Gaze upon the glorious greatness of this wealth,<BR>
 and your nights and days will pass, imbued with celestial peace. ||3||<BR>
 Listen to this incomparably beautiful story, O my brothers, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 Tell me, without this wealth, who has ever obtained the supreme status? ||4||<BR>
 Nanak humbly prays, I proclaim the Unspoken Speech of the Lord.<BR>
 If one meets the True Guru, then this wealth is obtained. ||5||8||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 Heat up the sun energy of the right nostril, and cool down the moon energy of the left nostril; practicing this breath-control, bring them into perfect balance.<BR>
 In this way, the fickle fish of the mind will be held steady; the swan-soul shall not fly away, and the body-wall will not crumble. ||1||<BR>
 You fool, why are you deluded by doubt?<BR>
 You do not remember the detached Lord of supreme bliss. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Seize and burn the unbearable; seize and kill the imperishable; leave behind your doubts, and then, you shall drink in the Nectar.<BR>
 In this way, the fickle fish of the mind will be held steady; the swan-soul shall not fly away, and the body-wall shall not crumble. ||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 004</H2></CENTER>
 Nanak humbly prays, if the Lord's humble servant dwells upon Him, in his mind of minds, with his every breath, then he drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar.<BR>
 In this way, the fickle fish of the mind will be held steady; the swan-soul shall not fly away, and the body-wall shall not crumble. ||3||9||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 Maya is not conquered, and the mind is not subdued; the waves of desire in the world-ocean are intoxicating wine.<BR>
 The boat crosses over the water, carrying the true merchandise.<BR>
 The jewel within the mind subdues the mind; attached to the Truth, it is not broken.<BR>
 The king is seated upon the throne, imbued with the Fear of God and the five qualities. ||1||<BR>
 O Baba, do not see your True Lord and Master as being far away.<BR>
 He is the Light of all, the Life of the world; The True Lord writes His Inscription on each and every head. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Brahma and Vishnu, the Rishis and the silent sages, Shiva and Indra, penitents and beggars<BR>
 - whoever obeys the Hukam of the Lord's Command, looks beautiful in the Court of the True Lord, while the stubborn rebels die.<BR>
 The wandering beggars, warriors, celibates and Sannyaasee hermits - through the Perfect Guru, consider this:<BR>
 without selfless service, no one ever receives the fruits of their rewards. Serving the Lord is the most excellent action. ||2||<BR>
 You are the wealth of the poor, the Guru of the guru-less, the honor of the dishonored.<BR>
 I am blind; I have grasped hold of the jewel, the Guru. You are the strength of the weak.<BR>
 He is not known through burnt offerings and ritual chanting; the True Lord is known through the Guru's Teachings.<BR>
 Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, no one finds shelter in the Court of the Lord; the false come and go in reincarnation. ||3||<BR>
 So praise the True Name, and through the True Name, you will find satisfaction.<BR>
 When the mind is cleaned with the jewel of spiritual wisdom, it does not become dirty again.<BR>
 As long as the Lord and Master dwells in the mind, no obstacles are encountered.<BR>
 O Nanak, giving one's head, one is emancipated, and the mind and body become true. ||4||10||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 The Yogi who is joined to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is pure; he is not stained by even a particle of dirt.<BR>
 The True Lord, his Beloved, is always with him; the rounds of birth and death are ended for him. ||1||<BR>
 O Lord of the Universe, what is Your Name, and what is it like?<BR>
 If You summon me into the Mansion of Your Presence, I will ask You, how I can become one with You. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He alone is a Brahmin, who takes his cleansing bath in the spiritual wisdom of God, and whose leaf-offerings in worship are the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<BR>
 The One Name, the One Lord, and His One Light pervade the three worlds. ||2||<BR>
 My tongue is the balance of the scale, and this heart of mine is the pan of the scale; I weigh the immeasurable Naam.<BR>
 There is one store, and one banker above all; the merchants deal in the one commodity. ||3||<BR>
 The True Guru saves us at both ends; he alone understands, who is lovingly focused on the One Lord; his inner being remains free of doubt.<BR>
 The Word of the Shabad abides within, and doubt is ended, for those who constantly serve, day and night. ||4||<BR>
 Above is the sky of the mind, and beyond this sky is the Lord, the Protector of the World; the Inaccessible Lord God; the Guru abides there as well.<BR>
 According to the Word of the Guru's Teachings, what is outside is the same as what is inside the home of the self. Nanak has become a detached renunciate. ||5||11||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 005</H2></CENTER>
 Raag Maaroo, First Mehl, Fifth House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Day and night, he remains awake and aware; he never sleeps or dreams.<BR>
 He alone knows this, who feels the pain of separation from God.<BR>
 My body is pierced through with the arrow of love. How can any physician know the cure? ||1||<BR>
 Rare is that one, who as Gurmukh, understands, and whom the True Lord links to His Praise.<BR>
 He alone appreciates the value of the Ambsosial Nectar, who deals in this Ambrosia. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The soul-bride is in love with her Husband Lord;<BR>
 the focuses her consciousness on the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 The soul-bride is joyously embellished with intuitive ease; her hunger and thirst are taken away. ||2||<BR>
 Tear down skepticism and dispel your doubt;<BR>
 with your intuition, draw the bow of the Praise of the Lord.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, conquer and subdue your mind; take the support of Yoga - Union with the beautiful Lord. ||3||<BR>
 Burnt by egotism, one forgets the Lord from his mind.<BR>
 In the City of Death, he is attacked with massive swords.<BR>
 Then, even if he asks for it, he will not receive the Lord's Name; O soul, you shall suffer terrible punishment. ||4||<BR>
 You are distracted by thoughts of Maya and worldly attachment.<BR>
 In the City of Death, you will be caught by the noose of the Messenger of Death.<BR>
 You cannot break free from the bondage of loving attachment, and so the Messenger of Death will torture you. ||5||<BR>
 I have done nothing; I am doing nothing now.<BR>
 The True Guru has blessed me with the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam.<BR>
 What other efforts can anyone make, when You bestow Your blessing? Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary. ||6||1||12||<BR>
 Maaroo, Third Mehl, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Wherever You seat me, there I sit, O my Lord and Master; wherever You send me, there I go.<BR>
 In the entire village, there is only One King; all places are sacred. ||1||<BR>
 O Baba, while I dwell in this body, let me sing Your True Praises,<BR>
 that I may intuitively merge with You. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He thinks that good and bad deeds come from himself; this is the source of all evil.<BR>
 Whatever happens in this world is only by the Order of our Lord and Master. ||2||<BR>
 Sexual desires are so strong and compelling; where has this sexual desire come from?<BR>
 The Creator Himself stages all the plays; how rare are those who realize this. ||3||<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, one is lovingly focused on the One Lord, and then, duality is ended.<BR>
 Whatever is in harmony with His Will, he accepts as True; the noose of Death is loosened from around his neck. ||4||<BR>
 Prays Nanak, who can call him to account, when the egotistical pride of his mind has been silenced?<BR>
 Even the Righteous Judge of Dharma is intimidated and afraid of him; he has entered the Sanctuary of the True Lord. ||5||1||<BR>
 Maaroo, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Coming and going in reincarnation no longer exist, when one dwells in the home of the self within.<BR>
 He bestowed the Blessing of His treasure of truth; only He Himself knows. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 006</H2></CENTER>
 O my mind, remember the Dear Lord, and abandon the corruption of your mind.<BR>
 Meditate on the Word of the Guru's Shabad; focus lovingly on the Truth. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 One who forgets the Name in this world, shall not find any place of rest anywhere else.<BR>
 He shall wander in all sorts of reincarnations, and rot away in manure. ||2||<BR>
 By great good fortune, I have found the Guru, according to my pre-ordained destiny, O my mother.<BR>
 Night and day, I practice true devotional worship; I am united with the True Lord. ||3||<BR>
 He Himself fashioned the entire universe; He Himself bestows His Glance of Grace.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is glorious and great; as He pleases, He bestows His Blessings. ||4||2||<BR>
 Maaroo, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Please forgive my past mistakes, O my Dear Lord; now, please place me on the Path.<BR>
 I remain attached to the Lord's Feet, and eradicate self-conceit from within. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, as Gurmukh, meditate on the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Remain attached forever to the Lord's Feet, single-mindedly, with love for the One Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I have no social status or honor; I have no place or home.<BR>
 Pierced through by the Word of the Shabad, my doubts have been cut away. The Guru has inspired me to understand the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 This mind wanders around, driven by greed, totally attached to greed.<BR>
 He is engrossed in false pursuits; he shall endure beatings in the City of Death. ||3||<BR>
 O Nanak, God Himself Himself is all-in-all. There is no other at all.<BR>
 He bestows the treasure of devotional worship, and the Gurmukhs abide in peace. ||4||3||<BR>
 Maaroo, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Seek and find those who are imbued with Truth; they are so rare in this world.<BR>
 Meeting with them, one's face becomes radiant and bright, chanting the Name of the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O Baba, contemplate and cherish the True Lord and Master within your heart.<BR>
 Seek out and see, and ask your True Guru, and obtain the true commodity. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 All serve the One True Lord; through pre-ordained destiny, they meet Him.<BR>
 The Gurmukhs merge with Him, and will not be separated from Him again; they attain the True Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Some do not appreciate the value of devotional worship; the self-willed manmukhs are deluded by doubt.<BR>
 They are fillled with self-conceit; they cannot accomplish anything. ||3||<BR>
 Stand and offer your prayer, to the One who cannot be moved by force.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides within the mind of the Gurmukh; hearing his prayer, the Lord applauds him. ||4||4||<BR>
 Maaroo, Third Mehl:<BR>
 He transforms the burning desert into a cool oasis; he transmutes rusted iron into gold.<BR>
 So praise the True Lord; there is none other as great as He is. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, night and day, meditate on the Lord's Name.<BR>
 Contemplate the Word of the Guru's Teachings, and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, night and day. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 As Gurmukh, one comes to know the One Lord, when the True Guru instructs him.<BR>
 Praise the True Guru, who imparts this understanding. ||2||<BR>
 Those who forsake the True Guru, and attach themselves to duality - what will they do when they go to the world hereafter?<BR>
 Bound and gagged in the City of Death, they will be beaten. They will be punished severely. ||3||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 007</H2></CENTER>
 My God is independent and self-sufficient; he does not have even an iota of greed.<BR>
 O Nanak, run to His Sanctuary; granting His forgiveness, He merges us into Himself. ||4||5||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fourth Mehl, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Suk-deva and Janak meditated on the Naam; following the Guru's Teachings, they sought the Sanctuary of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 God met Sudama and removed his poverty; through loving devotional worship, he crossed over.<BR>
 God is the Lover of His devotees; the Lord's Name is fufilling; God showers His Mercy on the Gurmukhs. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, you will be saved.<BR>
 Dhroo, Prahlaad and Bidar the slave-girl's son, became Gurmukh, and through the Naam, crossed over. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Naam is the supreme wealth; it saves the humble devotees.<BR>
 All the faults of Naam Dayv, Jai Dayv, Kabeer, Trilochan and Ravi Daas the leather-worker were covered.<BR>
 Those who become Gurmukh, and remain attached to the Naam, are saved; all their sins are washed off. ||2||<BR>
 Whoever chants the Naam, all his sins and mistakes are taken away.<BR>
 Ajaamal, who had sex with prostitites, was saved, by chanting the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Chanting the Naam, Ugar Sain obtained salvation; his bonds were broken, and he was liberated. ||3||<BR>
 God Himself takes pity on His humble servants, and makes them His own.<BR>
 My Lord of the Universe saves the honor of His servants; those who seek His Sanctuary are saved.<BR>
 The Lord has showered servant Nanak with His Mercy; he has enshrined the Lord's Name within his heart. ||4||1||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 The Siddhas in Samaadhi meditate on Him; they are lovingly focused on Him. The seekers and the silent sages meditate on Him as well.<BR>
 The celibates, the true and contented beings meditate on Him; Indra and the other gods chant His Name with their mouths.<BR>
 Those who seek His Sanctuary meditate on Him; they become Gurmukh and swim across. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and cross over.<BR>
 Dhanna the farmer, and Balmik the highway robber, became Gurmukh, and crossed over. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Angels, men, heavenly heralds and celestial singers meditate on Him; even the humble Rishis sing of the Lord.<BR>
 Shiva, Brahma and the goddess Lakhshmi, meditate, and chant with their mouths the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 Those whose minds are drenched with the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, as Gurmukh, cross over. ||2||<BR>
 Millions and millions, three hundred thirty million gods meditate on Him; there is no end to those who meditate on the Lord.<BR>
 The Vedas, the Puraanas and the Simritees meditate on the Lord; the Pandits, the religious scholars, sing the Lord's Praises as well.<BR>
 Those whose minds are filled with the Naam, the source of nectar - as Gurmukh, they cross over. ||3||<BR>
 Those who chant the Naam in endless waves - I cannot even count their number.<BR>
 The Lord of the Universe bestows His Mercy, and those who are pleasing to the Mind of the Lord God, find their place.<BR>
 The Guru, granting His Grace, implants the Lord's Name within; servant Nanak chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 008</H2></CENTER>
 Maaroo, Fourth Mehl, Third House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Take the treasure of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Follow the Guru's Teachings, and the Lord shall bless you with honor.<BR>
 Here and hereafter, the Lord goes with you; in the end, He shall deliver you.<BR>
 Where the path is difficult and the street is narrow, there the Lord shall liberate you. ||1||<BR>
 O my True Guru, implant within me the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 The Lord is my mother, father, child and relative; I have none other than the Lord, O my mother. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I feel the pains of love and yearning for the Lord, and the Name of the Lord. If only someone would come and unite me with Him, O my mother.<BR>
 I bow in humble devotion to one who inspires me to meet with my Beloved.<BR>
 The almighty and merciful True Guru unites me with the Lord God instantaneously. ||2||<BR>
 Those who do not remember the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, are most unfortunate, and are slaughtered.<BR>
 They wander in reincarnation, again and again; they die, and are re-born, and continue coming and going.<BR>
 Bound and gagged at Death's Door, they are cruelly beaten, and punished in the Court of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 O God, I seek Your Sanctuary; O my Sovereign Lord King, please unite me with Yourself.<BR>
 O Lord, Life of the World, please shower me with Your Mercy; grant me the Sanctuary of the Guru, the True Guru.<BR>
 The Dear Lord, becoming merciful, has blended servant Nanak with Himself. ||4||1||3||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 I inquire about the commodity of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Is there anyone who can show me the wealth, the capital of the Lord?<BR>
 I cut myself into pieces, and make myself a sacrifice to that one who leads me to meet my Lord God.<BR>
 I am filled with the Love of my Beloved; how can I meet my Friend, and merge with Him? ||1||<BR>
 O my beloved friend, my mind, I take the wealth, the capital of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 The Perfect Guru has implanted the Naam within me; the Lord is my support - I celebrate the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 O my Guru, please unite me with the Lord, Har, Har; show me the wealth, the capital of the Lord.<BR>
 Without the Guru, love does not well up; see this, and know it in your mind.<BR>
 The Lord has installed Himself within the Guru; so praise the Guru, who unites us with the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 The ocean, the treasure of devotional worship of the Lord, rests with the Perfect True Guru.<BR>
 When it pleases the True Guru, He opens the treasure, and and the Gurmukhs are illuminated by the Lord's Light.<BR>
 The unfortunate self-willed manmukhs die of thirst, on the very bank of the river. ||3||<BR>
 The Guru is the Great Giver; I beg for this gift from the Guru,<BR>
 that He may unite me with God, from whom I was separated for so long! This is the great hope of my mind and body.<BR>
 If it pleases You, O my Guru, please listen to my prayer; this is servant Nanak's prayer. ||4||2||4||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 O Lord God, please preach Your sermon to me. Through the Guru's Teachings, the Lord is merged into my heart.<BR>
 Meditate on the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, O very fortunate ones; the Lord shall bless you with the most sublime status of Nirvaanaa.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 009</H2></CENTER>
 The minds of the Gurmukhs are filled with faith; through the Perfect Guru, they merge in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, is pleasing to my mind.<BR>
 Continually and forever, speak the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har; as Gurmukh, speak the Unspoken Speech. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I have searched through and through my mind and body; how can I attain this Unspoken Speech?<BR>
 Meeting with the humble Saints, I have found it; listening to the Unspoken Speech, my mind is pleased.<BR>
 The Lord's Name is the Support of my mind and body; I am united with the all-knowing Primal Lord God. ||2||<BR>
 The Guru, the Primal Being, has united me with the Primal Lord God. My consciousness has merged into the supreme consciousness.<BR>
 By great good fortune, I serve the Guru, and I have found my Lord, all-wise and all-knowing.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs are very unfortunate; they pass their life-night in misery and pain. ||3||<BR>
 I am just a meek beggar at Your Door, God; please, place the Ambrosial Word of Your Bani in my mouth.<BR>
 The True Guru is my friend; He unites me with my all-wise, all-knowing Lord God.<BR>
 Servant Nanak has entered Your Sanctuary; grant Your Grace, and merge me into Your Name. ||4||3||5||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 Detached from the world, I am in love with the Lord; by great good fortune, I have enshrined the Lord within my mind.<BR>
 Joining the Sangat, the Holy Congregation, faith has welled up within me; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I taste the sublime essence of the Lord.<BR>
 My mind and body have totally blossomed forth; through the Word of the Guru's Bani, I chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O my beloved mind, my friend, taste the sublime essence of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 Through the Perfect Guru, I have found the Lord, who saves my honor, here and hereafter. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; as Gurmukh, taste the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.<BR>
 Plant the seed of the Lord in the body-farm. The Lord God is enshrined within the Sangat, the Holy Congregation.<BR>
 The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is Ambrosial Nectar. Through the Perfect Guru, taste the sublime essence of the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs are filled with hunger and thirst; their minds run around in the ten directions, hoping for great wealth.<BR>
 Without the Name of the Lord, their life is cursed; the manmukhs are stuck in manure.<BR>
 They come and go, and are consigned to wander through uncounted incarnations, eating stinking rot. ||3||<BR>
 Begging, imploring, I seek Your Sanctuary; Lord, shower me with Your Mercy, and save me, God.<BR>
 Lead me to join the Society of the Saints, and bless me with the honor and glory of the Lord's Name.<BR>
 I have obtained the wealth of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; servant Nanak chants the Lord's Name, through the Guru's Teachings. ||4||4||6||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fourth Mehl, Fifth House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Devotional worship to the Lord, Har, Har, is an overflowing treasure.<BR>
 The Gurmukh is emancipated by the Lord.<BR>
 One who is blessed by the Mercy of my Lord and Master sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O Lord, Har, Har, take pity on me,<BR>
 that within my heart, I may dwell upon You, Lord, forever and ever.<BR>
 Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my soul; chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, you shall be emancipated. ||1||Pause||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 010</H2></CENTER>
 The Ambrosial Name of the Lord is the ocean of peace.<BR>
 The beggar begs for it; O Lord, please bless him, in Your kindness.<BR>
 True, True is the Lord; the Lord is forever True; the True Lord is pleasing to my mind. ||2||<BR>
 The nine holes pour out filth.<BR>
 Chanting the Lord's Name, they are all purified and sanctified.<BR>
 When my Lord and Master is totally pleased, He leads the mortal to meditate in remembrance on the Lord, and then his filth is taken away. ||3||<BR>
 Attachment to Maya is terribly treacherous.<BR>
 How can one cross over the difficult world-ocean?<BR>
 The True Lord bestows the boat of the True Guru; meditating on the Lord, Har, Har, one is carried across. ||4||<BR>
 You are everywhere; all are Yours.<BR>
 Whatever You do, God, that alone comes to pass.<BR>
 Poor servant Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord; as it pleases the Lord, He bestows His approval. ||5||1||7||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my mind.<BR>
 The Lord shall eradicate all your sins.<BR>
 Treasure the Lord's wealth, and gather in the Lord's wealth; when you depart in the end, the Lord shall go along with you as your only friend and companion. ||1||<BR>
 He alone meditates on the Lord, unto whom He grants His Grace.<BR>
 He continually chants the Lord's Chant; meditating on the Lord, one finds peace.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, the sublime essence of the Lord is obtained. Meditating on the Lord, Har, Har, one is carried across. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The fearless, formless Lord - the Name is Truth.<BR>
 To chant it is the most sublime and exalted activity in this world.<BR>
 Doing so, the Messenger of Death, the evil enemy, is killed. Death does not even approach the Lord's servant. ||2||<BR>
 One whose mind is satisfied with the Lord<BR>
 - that servant is known throughout the four ages, in all four directions.<BR>
 If some sinner speaks evil of him, the Messenger of Death chews him up. ||3||<BR>
 The One Pure Creator Lord is in all.<BR>
 He stages all His wondrous plays, and watches them.<BR>
 Who can kill that person, whom the Lord has saved? The Creator Lord Himself delivers him. ||4||<BR>
 I chant the Name of the Creator Lord, night and day.<BR>
 He saves all His servants and devotees.<BR>
 Consult the eighteen Puraanas and the four Vedas; O servant Nanak, only the Naam, the Name of the Lord, will deliver you. ||5||2||8||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The earth, the Akaashic ethers and the stars abide in the Fear of God. The almighty Order of the Lord is over the heads of all.<BR>
 Wind, water and fire abide in the Fear of God; poor Indra abides in the Fear of God as well. ||1||<BR>
 I have heard one thing, that the One Lord alone is fearless.<BR>
 He alone is at peace, and he alone is embellished forever, who meets with the Guru, and sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The embodied and the divine beings abide in the Fear of God. The Siddhas and seekers die in the Fear of God.<BR>
 The 8.4 millions species of beings die, and die again, and are born over and over again. They are consigned to reincarnation. ||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 011</H2></CENTER>
 Those who embody the energies of sattva-white light, raajas-red passion, and taamas-black darkness, abide in the Fear of God, along with the many created forms.<BR>
 This miserable deceiver Maya abides in the Fear of God; the Righteous Judge of Dharma is utterly afraid of Him as well. ||3||<BR>
 The entire expanse of the Universe is in the Fear of God; only the Creator Lord is without this Fear.<BR>
 Says Nanak, God is the companion of His devotees; His devotees look beautiful in the Court of the Lord. ||4||1||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The five year old orphan boy Dhroo, by meditating in remembrance on the Lord, became stationary and permanent.<BR>
 For the sake of his son, Ajaamal called out, "O Lord, Naaraayan", who struck down and killed the Messenger of Death. ||1||<BR>
 My Lord and Master has saved many, countless beings.<BR>
 I am meek, with little or no understanding, and unworthy; I seek protection at the Lord's Door. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Baalmeek the outcaste was saved, and the poor hunter was saved as well.<BR>
 The elephant remembered the Lord in his mind for an instant, and so was carried across. ||2||<BR>
 He saved His devotee Prahlaad, and tore Harnaakhash with his nails.<BR>
 Bidar, the son of a slave-girl, was purified, and all his generations were redeemed. ||3||<BR>
 What sins of mine should I speak of? I am intoxicated with false emotional attachment.<BR>
 Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the Lord; please, reach out and take me into Your embrace. ||4||2||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 For the sake of riches, I wandered around in so many ways; I rushed around, making all sorts of efforts.<BR>
 The deeds I did in egotism and pride, have all been done in vain. ||1||<BR>
 Other days are of no use to me;<BR>
 please bless me with those days, O Dear God, on which I may sing the Lord's Praises. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Gazing upon children, spouse, household and possessions, one is entangled in these.<BR>
 Tasting the wine of Maya, one is intoxicated, and never sings of the Lord, Har, Har. ||2||<BR>
 In this way, I have examined lots of methods, but without the Saints, it is not found.<BR>
 You are the Great Giver, the great and almighty God; I have come to beg a gift from You. ||3||<BR>
 Abandoning all pride and self-importance, I have sought the Sanctuary of the dust of the feet of the Lord's slave.<BR>
 Says Nanak, meeting with the Lord, I have become one with Him; I have found supreme bliss and peace. ||4||3||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 In what place is the Name established? Where does egotism dwell?<BR>
 What injury have you suffered, listening to abuse from someone else's mouth? ||1||<BR>
 Listen: who are you, and where did you come from?<BR>
 You don't even know how long you will stay here; you have no hint of when you shall leave. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Wind and water have patience and tolerance; the earth has compassion and forgiveness, no doubt.<BR>
 The union of the five tattvas - the five elements - has brought you into being. Which of these is evil? ||2||<BR>
 The Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny, formed your form; He also burdened you with egotism.<BR>
 He alone is born and dies; He alone comes and goes. ||3||<BR>
 Nothing of the color and the form of the creation shall remain; the entire expanse is transitory.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, when He brings His play to its close, then only the One, the One Lord remains. ||4||4||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 012</H2></CENTER>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Pride, emotional attachment, greed and corruption are gone; I have not placed anything else, other than the Lord, within my consciousness.<BR>
 I have purchased the jewel of the Naam and the Glorious Praises of the Lord; loading this merchandise, I have set out on my journey. ||1||<BR>
 The love which the Lord's servant feels for the Lord lasts forever.<BR>
 In my life, I served my Lord and Master, and as I depart, I keep Him enshrined in my consciousness. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I have not turned my face away from my Lord and Master's Command.<BR>
 He fills my household with celestial peace and bliss; if He asks me to leave, I leave at once. ||2||<BR>
 When I am under the Lord's Command, I find even hunger pleasurable; I know no difference between sorrow and joy.<BR>
 Whatever the Command of my Lord and Master is, I bow my forehead and accept it. ||3||<BR>
 The Lord and Master has become merciful to His servant; He has embellished both this world and the next.<BR>
 Blessed is that servant, and fruitful is his birth; O Nanak, he realizes his Lord and Master. ||4||5||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Good karma has dawned for me - my Lord and Master has become merciful. I sing the Kirtan of the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 My struggle is ended; I have found peace and tranquility. All my wanderings have ceased. ||1||<BR>
 Now, I have obtained the state of eternal life.<BR>
 The Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny, has come into my conscious mind; I seek the Sanctuary of the Saints. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment are eradicated; all my enemies are eliminated.<BR>
 He is always ever-present, here and now, watching over me; He is never far away. ||2||<BR>
 In peace and cool tranquility, my faith has been totally fulfilled; the Saints are my Helpers and Support.<BR>
 He has purified the sinners in an instant; I cannot express His Glorious Praises. ||3||<BR>
 I have become fearless; all fear has departed. The feet of the Lord of the Universe are my only Shelter.<BR>
 Nanak sings the Praises of his Lord and Master; night and day, he is lovingly focused on Him. ||4||6||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 He is all-powerful, the Master of all virtues, but you never sing of Him!<BR>
 You shall have to leave all this in an instant, but again and again, you chase after it. ||1||<BR>
 Why do you not contemplate your God?<BR>
 You are entangled in association with your enemies, and the enjoyment of pleasures; your soul is burning up with them! ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Hearing His Name, the Messenger of Death will release you, and yet, you do not enter His Sanctuary!<BR>
 Turn out this wretched jackal, and seek the Shelter of that God. ||2||<BR>
 Praising Him, you shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean, and yet, you have not fallen in love with Him!<BR>
 This meager, short-lived dream, this thing - you are engrossed in it, over and over again. ||3||<BR>
 When our Lord and Master, the ocean of mercy, grants His Grace, one finds honor in the Society of the Saints.<BR>
 Says Nanak, I am rid of the illusion of the three-phased Maya, when God becomes my help and support. ||4||7||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, knows everything; what can anyone hide from Him?<BR>
 Your hands and feet will fall off in an instant, when you are burnt in the fire. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 013</H2></CENTER>
 You fool, you have forgotten the Lord from your mind!<BR>
 You eat His salt, and then you are untrue to Him; before your very eyes, you shall be torn apart. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The incurable disease has arisen in your body; it cannot be removed or overcome.<BR>
 Forgetting God, one endures utter agony; this is the essence of reality which Nanak has realized. ||2||8||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I have enshrined the lotus feet of God within my consciousness.<BR>
 I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, continually, continuously.<BR>
 There is none other than Him at all.<BR>
 He alone exists, in the beginning, in the middle, and in the end. ||1||<BR>
 He Himself is the Shelter of the Saints. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The entire universe is under His control.<BR>
 He Himself, the Formless Lord, is Himself by Himself.<BR>
 Nanak holds tight to that True Lord.<BR>
 He has found peace, and shall never suffer pain again. ||2||9||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl, Third House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 He is the Giver of peace to the breath of life, the Giver of life to the soul; how can you forget Him, you ignorant person?<BR>
 You taste the weak, insipid wine, and you have gone insane. You have uselessly wasted this precious human life. ||1||<BR>
 O man, such is the foolishness you practice.<BR>
 Renouncing the Lord, the Support of the earth, you wander, deluded by doubt; you are engrossed in emotional attachment, associating with Maya, the slave-girl. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Abandoning the Lord, the Support of the earth, you serve her of lowly ancestry, and you pass you life acting egotistically.<BR>
 You do useless deeds, you ignorant person; this is why you are called a blind, self-willed manmukh. ||2||<BR>
 That which is true, you believe to be untrue; what is transitory, you believe to be permanent.<BR>
 You grasp as your own, what belongs to others; in such delusions you are deluded. ||3||<BR>
 The Kh'shaatriyas, Brahmins, Soodras and Vaishyas all cross over, through the Name of the One Lord.<BR>
 Guru Nanak speaks the Teachings; whoever listens to them is carried across. ||4||1||10||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 You may act in secrecy, but God is still with you; you can only deceive other people.<BR>
 Forgetting your Dear Lord, you enjoy corrupt pleasures, and so you shall have to embrace red-hot pillars. ||1||<BR>
 O man, why do you go out to the households of others?<BR>
 You filthy, heartless, lustful donkey! Haven't you heard of the Righteous Judge of Dharma? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The stone of corruption is tied around your neck, and the load of slander is on your head.<BR>
 You must cross over the vast open ocean, but you cannot cross over to the other side. ||2||<BR>
 You are engrossed in sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment; you have turned your eyes away from the Truth.<BR>
 You cannot even raise your head above the water of the vast, impassable sea of Maya. ||3||<BR>
 The sun is liberated, and the moon is liberated; the God-realized being is pure and untouched.<BR>
 His inner nature is like that of fire, untouched and forever immaculate. ||4||<BR>
 When good karma dawns, the wall of doubt is torn down. He lovingly accepts the Guru's Will.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 014</H2></CENTER>
 One who is blessed with the medicine of the GurMantra, the Name of the Lord, O servant Nanak, does not suffer the agonies of reincarnation. ||5||2||<BR>
 O man, in this way, you shall cross over to the other side.<BR>
 Meditate on your Dear Lord, and be dead to the world; renounce your love of duality. ||Second Pause||2||11||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I have quit searching outside; the Guru has shown me that God is within the home of my own heart.<BR>
 I have seen God, fearless, of wondrous beauty; my mind shall never leave Him to go anywhere else. ||1||<BR>
 I have found the jewel; I have found the Perfect Lord.<BR>
 The invaluable value cannot be obtained; in His Mercy, the Guru bestows it. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Supreme Lord God is imperceptible and unfathomable; meeting the Holy Saint, I speak the Unspoken Speech.<BR>
 The unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates and resounds in the Tenth Gate; the Ambrosial Naam trickles down there. ||2||<BR>
 I lack nothing; the thirsty desires of my mind are satisfied. The inexhaustible treasure has entered into my being.<BR>
 I serve the feet, the feet, the feet of the Guru, and manage the unmanageable. I have found the juice, the sublime essence. ||3||<BR>
 Intuitively I come, and intuively I go; my mind intuitively plays.<BR>
 Says Nanak, when the Guru drives out doubt, then the soul-bride enters the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||4||3||12||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 You feel no love for the One who created and embellished you.<BR>
 The seed, planted out season, does not germinate; it does not produce flower or fruit. ||1||<BR>
 O mind, this is the time to plant the seed of the Name.<BR>
 Focus your mind, and cultivate this crop; at the proper time, make this your purpose. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Eradicate the stubbornness and doubt of your mind, and go to the Sanctuary of the True Guru.<BR>
 He alone does such deeds, who has such pre-ordained karma. ||2||<BR>
 He falls in love with the Lord of the Universe, and his efforts are approved.<BR>
 My crop has germinated, and it shall never be used up. ||3||<BR>
 I have obtained the priceless wealth, which shall never leave me or go anywhere else.<BR>
 Says Nanak, I have found peace; I am satisfied and fulfilled. ||4||4||13||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The egg of doubt has burst; my mind has been enlightened.<BR>
 The Guru has shattered the shackles on my feet, and has set me free. ||1||<BR>
 My coming and going in reincarnation is ended.<BR>
 The boiling cauldron has cooled down; the Guru has blessed me with the cooling, soothing Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Since I joined the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, those who were eyeing me have left.<BR>
 The one who tied me up, has released me; what can the Watchman of Death do to me now? ||2||<BR>
 The load of my karma has been removed, and I am now free of karma.<BR>
 I have crossed the world-ocean, and reached the other shore; the Guru has blessed me with this Dharma. ||3||<BR>
 True is my place, and True is my seat; I have made Truth my life's purpose.<BR>
 True is my capital, and True is the merchandise, which Nanak has placed into the home of the heart. ||4||5||14||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 015</H2></CENTER>
 The Pandit, the religious scholar, proclaims the Vedas, but he is slow to act on them.<BR>
 Another person on silence sits alone, but his heart is tied in knots of desire.<BR>
 Another becomes an Udaasi, a renunciate; he abandons his home and walks out on his family, but his wandering impulses do not leave him. ||1||<BR>
 Who can I tell about the state of my soul?<BR>
 Where can I find such a person who is liberated, and who can unite me with my God? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Someone may practice intensive meditation, and discipline his body, but his mind still runs around in ten directions.<BR>
 The celibate practices celibacy, but his heart is filled with pride.<BR>
 The Sannyaasi wanders around at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, but his mindless anger is still within him. ||2||<BR>
 The temple dancers tie bells around their ankles to earn their living.<BR>
 Others go on fasts, take vows, perform the six rituals and wear religious robes for show.<BR>
 Some sing songs and melodies and hymns, but their minds do not sing of the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||<BR>
 The Lord's Saints are immaculately pure; they are beyond pleasure and pain, beyond greed and attachment.<BR>
 My mind obtains the dust of their feet, when the Lord God shows mercy.<BR>
 Says Nanak, I met the Perfect Guru, and then the anxiety of my mind was removed. ||4||<BR>
 My Sovereign Lord is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.<BR>
 The Beloved of my soul knows everything; all trivial talk is forgotten. ||1||Second Pause||6||15||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One who has Your Name in his heart is the king of all the hundreds of thousands and millions of beings.<BR>
 Those, whom my True Guru has not blessed with Your Name, are poor idiots, who die and are reborn. ||1||<BR>
 My True Guru protects and preserves my honor.<BR>
 When You come to mind, Lord, then I obtain perfect honor. Forgetting You, I roll in the dust. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The mind's pleasures of love and beauty bring just as many blames and sins.<BR>
 The Name of the Lord is the treasure of Emancipation; it is absolute peace and poise. ||2||<BR>
 The pleasures of Maya fade away in an instant, like the shade of a passing cloud.<BR>
 They alone are dyed in the deep crimson of the Lord's Love, who meet the Guru, and sing the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||<BR>
 My Lord and Master is lofty and exalted, grand and infinite. The Darbaar of His Court is inaccessible.<BR>
 Through the Naam, glorious greatness and respect are obtained; O Nanak, my Lord and Master is my Beloved. ||4||7||16||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl, Fourth House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The One Universal Creator Lord created the creation.<BR>
 He made all the days and the nights.<BR>
 The forests, meadows, three worlds, water,<BR>
 the four Vedas, the four sources of creation,<BR>
 the countries, the continents and all the worlds,<BR>
 have all come from the One Word of the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Hey - understand the Creator Lord.<BR>
 If you meet the True Guru, then you'll understand. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He formed the expanse of the entire universe from the three gunas, the three qualities.<BR>
 People are incarnated in heaven and in hell.<BR>
 In egotism, they come and go.<BR>
 The mind cannot hold still, even for an instant.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 016</H2></CENTER>
 Without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness.<BR>
 Meeting with the True Guru, one is emancipated. ||2||<BR>
 All the deeds done in egotism,<BR>
 are just chains around the neck.<BR>
 Harboring self-conceit and self-interest<BR>
 is just like placing chains around one's ankles.<BR>
 He alone meets with the Guru, and realizes the One Lord,<BR>
 who has such destiny written on his forehead. ||3||<BR>
 He alone meets the Lord, who is pleasing to His Mind.<BR>
 He alone is deluded, who is deluded by God.<BR>
 No one, by himself, is ignorant or wise.<BR>
 He alone chants the Naam, whom the Lord inspires to do so.<BR>
 You have no end or limitation.<BR>
 Servant Nanak is forever a sacrifice to You. ||4||1||17||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Maya, the enticer, has enticed the world of the three gunas, the three qualities.<BR>
 The false world is engrossed in greed.<BR>
 Crying out, "Mine, mine!" they collect possessions, but in the end, they are all deceived. ||1||<BR>
 The Lord is fearless, formless and merciful.<BR>
 He is the Cherisher of all beings and creatures. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Some collect wealth, and bury it in the ground.<BR>
 Some cannot abandon wealth, even in their dreams.<BR>
 The king exercises his power, and fills his money-bags, but this fickle companion will not go along with him. ||2||<BR>
 Some love this wealth even more than their body and breath of life.<BR>
 Some collect it, forsaking their fathers and mothers.<BR>
 Some hide it from their children, friends and siblings, but it will not remain with them. ||3||<BR>
 Some become hermits, and sit in meditative trances.<BR>
 Some are Yogis, celibates, religious scholars and thinkers.<BR>
 Some dwell in homes, graveyards, cremation grounds and forests; but Maya still clings to them there. ||4||<BR>
 When the Lord and Master releases one from his bonds,<BR>
 the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, comes to dwell in his soul.<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, His humble servants are liberated; O Nanak, they are redeemed and enraptured by the Lord's Glance of Grace. ||5||2||18||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Meditate in remembrance on the One Immaculate Lord.<BR>
 No one is turned away from Him empty-handed.<BR>
 He cherished and preserved you in your mother's womb;<BR>
 He blessed you with body and soul, and embellished you.<BR>
 Each and every instant, meditate on that Creator Lord.<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance on Him, all faults and mistakes are covered.<BR>
 Enshrine the Lord's lotus feet deep within the nucleus of your self.<BR>
 Save your soul from the waters of corruption.<BR>
 Your cries and shrieks shall be ended;<BR>
 meditating on the Lord of the Universe, your doubts and fears shall be dispelled.<BR>
 Rare is that being, who finds the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<BR>
 Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to Him. ||1||<BR>
 The Lord's Name is the support of my mind and body.<BR>
 Whoever meditates on Him is emancipated. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He believes that the false thing is true.<BR>
 The ignorant fool falls in love with it.<BR>
 He is intoxicated with the wine of sexual desire, anger and greed;<BR>
 he loses this human life in exchance for a mere shell.<BR>
 He abandons his own, and loves that of others.<BR>
 His mind and body are permeated with the intoxication of Maya.<BR>
 His thirsty desires are not quenched, although he indulges in pleasures.<BR>
 His hopes are not fulfilled, and all his words are false.<BR>
 He comes alone, and he goes alone.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 017</H2></CENTER>
 False is all his talk of me and you.<BR>
 The Lord Himself administers the poisonous potion, to mislead and delude.<BR>
 O Nanak, the the karma of past actions cannot be erased. ||2||<BR>
 Beasts, birds, demons and ghosts<BR>
 - in these many ways, the false wander in reincarnation.<BR>
 Wherever they go, they cannot remain there.<BR>
 They have no place of rest; they rise up again and again and run around.<BR>
 Their minds and bodies are filled with immense, expansive desires.<BR>
 The poor wretches are cheated by egotism.<BR>
 They are filled with countless sins, and are severely punished.<BR>
 The extent of this cannot be estimated.<BR>
 Forgetting God, they fall into hell.<BR>
 There are no mothers there, no siblings, no friends and no spouses.<BR>
 Those humble beings, unto whom the Lord and Master becomes Merciful,<BR>
 O Nanak, cross over. ||3||<BR>
 Rambling and roaming, wandering around, I came to seek the Sanctuary of God.<BR>
 He is the Master of the meek, the father and mother of the world.<BR>
 The Merciful Lord God is the Destroyer of sorrow and suffering.<BR>
 He emancipates whoever He pleases.<BR>
 He lifts them up and pulls him out of the deep dark pit.<BR>
 Emancipation comes through loving devotional worship.<BR>
 The Holy Saint is the very embodiment of the Lord's form.<BR>
 He Himself saves us from the great fire.<BR>
 By myself, I cannot practice meditation, austerities, penance and self-discipline.<BR>
 In the beginning and in the end, God is inaccessible and unfathomable.<BR>
 Please bless me with Your Name, Lord; Your slave begs only for this.<BR>
 O Nanak, my Lord God is the Giver of the true state of life. ||4||3||19||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Why do you try to deceive others, O people of the world? The Fascinating Lord is Merciful to the meek. ||1||<BR>
 This is what I have come to know.<BR>
 The brave and heroic Guru, the Generous Giver, gives Sanctuary and preserves our honor. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He submits to the Will of His devotees; He is forever and ever the Giver of peace. ||2||<BR>
 Please bless me with Your Mercy, that I may meditate on Your Name alone. ||3||<BR>
 Nanak, the meek and humble, begs for the Naam, the Name of the Lord; it eradicates duality and doubt. ||4||4||20||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 My Lord and Master is utterly powerful.<BR>
 I am just His poor servant. ||1||<BR>
 My Enticing Beloved is very dear to my mind and my breath of life.<BR>
 He blesses me with His gift. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I have seen and tested all.<BR>
 There is none other than Him. ||2||<BR>
 He sustains and nurtures all beings.<BR>
 He was, and shall always be. ||3||<BR>
 Please bless me with Your Mercy, O Divine Lord,<BR>
 and link Nanak to Your service. ||4||5||21||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The Redeemer of sinners, who carries us across; I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice to Him.<BR>
 If only I could meet with such a Saint, who would inspire me to meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, Har. ||1||<BR>
 No one knows me; I am called Your slave.<BR>
 This is my support and sustenance. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You support and cherish all; I am meek and humble - this is my only prayer.<BR>
 You alone know Your Way; You are the water, and I am the fish. ||2||<BR>
 O Perfect and Expansive Lord and Master, I follow You in love.<BR>
 O God, You are pervading all the worlds, solar systems and galaxies. ||3||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 018</H2></CENTER>
 You are eternal and unchanging, imperishable, invisible and infinite, O divine fascinating Lord.<BR>
 Please bless Nanak with the gift of the Society of the Saints, and the dust of the feet of Your slaves. ||4||6||22||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The Saints are fulfilled and satisfied;<BR>
 they know the Guru's Mantra and the Teachings.<BR>
 They cannot even be described;<BR>
 they are blessed with the glorious greatness of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 My Beloved is a priceless jewel.<BR>
 His Name is unattainable and immeasurable. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 One whose mind is satisfied believing in the imperishable Lord God,<BR>
 becomes Gurmukh and attains the essence of spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 He sees all in his meditation.<BR>
 He banishes egotistical pride from his mind. ||2||<BR>
 Permanent is the place of those<BR>

 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl, Sixth House, Du-Padas:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Abandon all your clever tricks; meet with the Holy, and renounce your egotistical pride.<BR>
 Everything else is false; with your tongue, chant the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, with your ears, listen to the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 The sins of your many past lifetimes shall be washed away; then, what can the wretched Messenger of Death do to you? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Pain, poverty and fear shall not afflict you, and you shall find peace and pleasure.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, Nanak speaks; meditation on the Lord is the essence of spiritual wisdom. ||2||1||24||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Those who have forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord - I have seen them reduced to dust.<BR>
 The love of children and friends, and the pleasures of married life are torn apart. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, continually, continuously chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 You shall not burn in the ocean of fire, and your mind and body shall be blessed with peace. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Like the shade of a tree, these things shall pass away, like the clouds blown away by the wind.<BR>
 Meeting with the Holy, devotional worship to the Lord is implanted within; O Nanak, only this shall work for you. ||2||2||25||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The perfect, primal Lord is the Giver of peace; He is always with you.<BR>
 He does not die, and he does not come or go in reincarnation. He does not perish, and He is not affected by heat or cold. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, be in love with the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Within the mind, think of the Lord, Har, Har, the treasure. This is the purest way of life. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Whoever meditates on the merciful compassionate Lord, the Lord of the Universe, is successful.<BR>
 He is always new, fresh and young, clever and beautiful; Nanak's mind is pierced through with His Love. ||2||3||26||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 While walking and sitting, sleeping and waking, contemplate within your heart the GurMantra.<BR>
 Run to the Lord's lotus feet, and join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Cross over the terrifying world-ocean, and reach the other side. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 019</H2></CENTER>
 O my mind, enshrine the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within your heart.<BR>
 Love the Lord, and commit your mind and body to Him; forget everything else. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Soul, mind, body and breath of life belong to God; eliminate your self-conceit.<BR>
 Meditate, vibrate on the Lord of the Universe, and all your desires shall be fulfilled; O Nanak, you shall never be defeated. ||2||4||27||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Renounce your self-conceit, and the fever shall depart; become the dust of the feet of the Holy.<BR>
 He alone receives Your Name, Lord, whom You bless with Your Mercy. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Abandon other bland, insipid tastes; become immortal, and live throughout the ages. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Savor the essence of the One and only Naam; love the Naam, focus and attune yourself to the Naam.<BR>
 Nanak has made the One Lord his only friend, companion and relative. ||2||5||28||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 He nourishes and preserves mortals in the womb of the mother, so that the fiery heat does not hurt them.<BR>
 That Lord and Master protects us here. Understand this in your mind. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, take the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Understand the One who created you; the One God is the Cause of causes. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Remember the One Lord in your mind, renounce your clever tricks, and give up all your religious robes.<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance forever on the Lord, Har, Har, O Nanak, countless beings have been saved. ||2||6||29||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 His Name is the Purifier of sinners; He is the Master of the masterless.<BR>
 In the vast and terrifying world-ocean, he is the raft for those who have such destiny inscribed on their foreheads. ||1||<BR>
 Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, huge numbers of companions have drowned.<BR>
 Even if someone does not remember the Lord, the Cause of causes, still, the Lord reaches out with His hand, and saves him. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and take the Path of the Ambrosial Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Shower me with Your Mercy, O Lord; listening to Your sermon, Nanak lives. ||2||7||30||<BR>
 Maaroo, Anjulee ~ With Hands Cupped In Prayer, Fifth Mehl, Seventh House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Union and separation are ordained by the Primal Lord God.<BR>
 The puppet is made from the five elements.<BR>
 By the Command of the Dear Lord King, the soul came and entered into the body. ||1||<BR>
 In that place, where the fire rages like an oven,<BR>
 in that darkness where the body lies face down<BR>
 - there, one remembers his Lord and Master with each and every breath, and then he is rescued. ||2||<BR>
 Then, one comes out from within the womb,<BR>
 and forgetting his Lord and Master, he attaches his consciousness to the world.<BR>
 He comes and goes, and wanders in reincarnation; he cannot remain anywhere. ||3||<BR>
 The Merciful Lord Himself emancipates.<BR>
 He created and established all beings and creatures.<BR>
 Those who depart after having been victorious in this priceless human life - O Nanak, their coming into the world is approved. ||4||1||31||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 020</H2></CENTER>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The One Lord alone is our help and support; neither physician nor friend, nor sister nor brother can be this. ||1||<BR>
 His actions alone come to pass; He washes off the filth of sins. Meditate in remembrance on that Supreme Lord. ||2||<BR>
 He abides in each and every heart, and dwells in all; His seat and place are eternal. ||3||<BR>
 He does not come or go, and He is always with us. His actions are perfect. ||4||<BR>
 He is the Savior and the Protector of His devotees.<BR>
 The Saints live by meditating on God, the support of the breath of life.<BR>
 The Almighty Lord and Master is the Cause of causes; Nanak is a sacrifice to Him. ||5||2||32||<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Maaroo, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 The Name of the Lord is forever the Giver of peace.<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance on it, Ajaamal was saved, and Ganika the prostitute was emancipated. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Dropadi the princess of Panchaala remembered the Lord's Name in the royal court.<BR>
 The Lord, the embodiment of mercy, removed her suffering; thus His own glory was increased. ||1||<BR>
 That man, who sings the Praise of the Lord, the treasure of mercy, has the help and support of the Lord.<BR>
 Says Nanak, I have come to rely on this. I seek the Sanctuary of the Lord. ||2||1||<BR>
 Maaroo, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 What should I do now, O mother?<BR>
 I have wasted my whole life in sin and corruption; I never remembered the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 When Death places the noose around my neck, then I lose all my senses.<BR>
 Now, in this disaster, other than the Name of the Lord, who will be my help and support? ||1||<BR>
 That wealth, which he believes to be his own, in an instant, belongs to another.<BR>
 Says Nanak, this still really bothers my mind - I never sang the Praises of the Lord. ||2||2||<BR>
 Maaroo, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 O my mother, I have not renounced the pride of my mind.<BR>
 I have wasted my life intoxicated with Maya; I have not focused myself in meditation on the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 When Death's club falls on my head, then I will be wakened from my sleep.<BR>
 But what good will it do to repent at that time? I cannot escape by running away. ||1||<BR>
 When this anxiety arises in the heart, then, one comes to love the Guru's feet.<BR>
 My life becomes fruitful, O Nanak, only when I am absorbed in the Praises of God. ||2||3||<BR>
 Maaroo, Ashtapadees, First Mehl, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Reciting and listening to the Vedas and the Puraanas, countless wise men have grown weary.<BR>
 So many in their various religious robes have grown weary, wandering to the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage.<BR>
 The True Lord and Master is immaculate and pure. The mind is satisfied only by the One Lord. ||1||<BR>
 You are eternal; You do not grow old. All others pass away.<BR>
 One who lovingly focuses on the Naam, the source of nectar - his pains are taken away. ||1||Pause||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 021</H2></CENTER>
 Study the Lord's Name, and understand the Lord's Name; follow the Guru's Teachings, and through the Naam, you shall be saved.<BR>
 Perfect are the Teachings of the Perfect Guru; contemplate the Perfect Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 The Lord's Name is the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, and the Eradicator of sins. ||2||<BR>
 The blind ignorant mortal stirs the water and churns the water, wishing to obtain butter.<BR>
 Following the Guru's Teachings, one churns the cream, and the treasure of the Ambrosial Naam is obtained.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh is a beast; he does not know the essence of reality that is contained within himself. ||3||<BR>
 Dying in egotism and self-conceit, one dies, and dies again, only to be reincarnated over and over again.<BR>
 But when he dies in the Word of the Guru's Shabad, then he does not die, ever again.<BR>
 When he follows the Guru's Teachings, and enshrines the Lord, the Life of the World, within his mind, he redeems all his generations. ||4||<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the true object, the true commodity.<BR>
 The Naam is the only true profit in this world. Follow the Guru's Teachings, and contemplate it.<BR>
 To work in the love of duality, brings constant loss in this world. ||5||<BR>
 True is one's association, true is one's place, and true is one's hearth and home, when one has the support of the Naam.<BR>
 Contemplating the True Word of the Guru's Bani, and the True Word of the Shabad, one becomes content. ||6||<BR>
 Enjoying princely pleasures, one shall be destroyed in pain and pleasure.<BR>
 Adopting a name of greatness, one strings heavy sins around his neck.<BR>
 Mankind cannot give gifts; You alone are the Giver of everything. ||7||<BR>
 You are inaccessible and unfathomable; O Lord, You are imperishable and infinite.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, seeking at the Lord's Door, one finds the treasure of liberation.<BR>
 O Nanak, this union is not broken, if one deals in the merchandise of Truth. ||8||1||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 The boat is loaded with sin and corruption, and launched into the sea.<BR>
 The shore cannot be seen on this side, nor on the shore beyond.<BR>
 There are no oars, nor any boatmen, to cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||<BR>
 O Baba, the world is caught in the great noose.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, they are saved, contemplating the True Name. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The True Guru is the boat; the Word of the Shabad will carry them across.<BR>
 There is neither wind nor fire, neither water nor form there.<BR>
 The True Name of the True Lord is there; it carries them across the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||<BR>
 The Gurmukhs reach the shore beyond, lovingly focusing on the True Lord.<BR>
 Their comings and goings are ended, and their light merges into the Light.<BR>
 Following the Guru's Teachings, intuitive peace wells up within them, and they remain merged in the True Lord. ||3||<BR>
 The snake may be locked in a basket, but it is still poisonous, and the anger within its mind remains.<BR>
 One obtains what is pre-ordained; why does he blame others?<BR>
 If one, as Gurmukh, hears and believes in the Name, the charm against poison, his mind becomes content. ||4||<BR>
 The crocodile is caught by the hook and line;<BR>
 caught in the trap of evil-mindedness, he regrets and repents, again and again.<BR>
 He does not understand birth and death; the inscription of one's past actions cannot be erased. ||5||<BR>
 Injecting the poison of egotism, the world was created; with the Shabad enshrined within, the poison is eliminated.<BR>
 Old age cannot torment one who remains lovingly absorbed in the True Lord.<BR>
 He alone is called Jivan-Mikta, liberated while yet alive, from within whom egotism is eradicated. ||6||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 022</H2></CENTER>
 The world is chasing after worldly affairs; caught and bound, it does not understand contemplative meditation.<BR>
 The foolish, ignorant, self-willed manmukh has forgotten birth and death.<BR>
 Those whom the Guru has protected are saved, contemplating the True Word of the Shabad. ||7||<BR>
 In the cage of divine love, the parrot, speaks.<BR>
 It pecks at the Truth, and drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar; it flies away, only once.<BR>
 Meeting with the Guru, one recognizes his Lord and Master; says Nanak, he finds the gate of liberation. ||8||2||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 One who dies in the Word of the Shabad conquers death; otherwise, where can you run?<BR>
 Through the Fear of God, fear runs away; His Name is Ambrosial Nectar.<BR>
 You alone kill and protect; except for You, there is no place at all. ||1||<BR>
 O Baba, I am filthy, shallow and totally without understanding.<BR>
 Without the Naam, no one is anything; the Perfect Guru has made my intellect perfect. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I am full of faults, and I have no virtue at all. Without virtues, how can I go home?<BR>
 Through the Word of the Shabad, intuitive peace wells up; without good destiny, the wealth is not obtained.<BR>
 Those whose minds are not filled with the Naam are bound and gagged, and suffer in pain. ||2||<BR>
 Those who have forgotten the Naam - why have they even come into the world?<BR>
 Here and hereafter, they do not find any peace; they have loaded their carts with ashes.<BR>
 Those who are separated, do not meet with the Lord; they suffer in terrible pain at Death's Door. ||3||<BR>
 I do not know what will happen in the world hereafter; I am so confused - please teach me, Lord!<BR>
 I am confused; I would fall at the feet of one who shows me the Way.<BR>
 Without the Guru, there is no giver at all; His value cannot be described. ||4||<BR>
 If I see my friend, then I will embrace Him; I have sent Him the letter of Truth.<BR>
 His soul-bride stands waiting expectantly; as Gurmukh, I see Him with my eyes.<BR>
 By the Pleasure of Your Will, You abide in my mind, and bless me with Your Glance of Grace. ||5||<BR>
 One who is wandering hungry and thirsty - what can he give, and what can anyone ask from him?<BR>
 I cannot conceive of any other, who can bless my mind and body with perfection.<BR>
 The One who created me takes care of me; He Himself blesses me with glory. ||6||<BR>
 In the body-village is my Lord and Master, whose body is ever-new, Innocent and child-like, incomparably playful.<BR>
 He is neither a woman, nor a man, nor a bird; the True Lord is so wise and beautiful.<BR>
 Whatever pleases Him, happens; You are the lamp, and You are the incense. ||7||<BR>
 He hears the songs and tastes the flavors, but these flavors are useless and insipid, and bring only disease to the body.<BR>
 One who loves the Truth and speaks the Truth, escapes from the sorrow of separation.<BR>
 Nanak does not forget the Naam; whatever happens is by the Lord's Will. ||8||3||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 Practice Truth - other greed and attachments are useless.<BR>
 The True Lord has fascinated this mind, and my tongue enjoys the taste of Truth.<BR>
 Without the Name, there is no juice; the others depart, loaded with poison. ||1||<BR>
 I am such a slave of Yours, O my Beloved Lord and Master.<BR>
 I walk in harmony with Your Command, O my True, Sweet Beloved. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Night and day, the slave works for his overlord.<BR>
 I have sold my mind for the Word of the Guru's Shabad; my mind is comforted and consoled by the Shabad.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 023</H2></CENTER>
 The Perfect Guru is honored and celebrated; He has taken away the pains of my mind. ||2||<BR>
 I am the servant and slave of my Master; what glorious greatness of His can I describe?<BR>
 The Perfect Master, by the Pleasure of His Will, forgives, and then one practices Truth.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who re-unites the separated ones. ||3||<BR>
 The intellect of His servant and slave is noble and true; it is made so by the Guru's intellect.<BR>
 The intuition of those who are true is beautiful; the intellect of the self-willed manmukh is insipid.<BR>
 My mind and body belong to You, God; from the very beginning, Truth has been my only support. ||4||<BR>
 In Truth I sit and stand; I eat and speak the Truth.<BR>
 With Truth in my consciousness, I gather the wealth of Truth, and drink in the sublime essence of Truth.<BR>
 In the home of Truth, the True Lord protects me; I speak the Words of the Guru's Teachings with love. ||5||<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh is very lazy; he is trapped in the wilderness.<BR>
 He is drawn to the bait, and continually pecking at it, he is trapped; his link to the Lord is ruined.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, one is liberated, absorbed in the primal trance of Truth. ||6||<BR>
 His slave remains continually pierced through with love and affection for God.<BR>
 Without the True Lord, the soul of the false, corrupt person is burnt to ashes.<BR>
 Abandoning all evil actions, he crosses over in the boat of Truth. ||7||<BR>
 Those who have forgotten the Naam have no home, no place of rest.<BR>
 The Lord's slave renounces greed and attachment, and obtains the Lord's Name.<BR>
 If You forgive him, Lord, then He is united with You; Nanak is a sacrifice. ||8||4||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 The Lord's slave renounces his egotistical pride, through the Guru's Fear, intuitively and easily.<BR>
 The slave realizes his Lord and Master; glorious is his greatness!<BR>
 Meeting with his Lord and Master, he finds peace; His value cannot be desribed. ||1||<BR>
 I am the slave and servant of my Lord and Master; all glory is to my Master.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, I am saved, in the Sanctuary of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The slave has been given the most excellent task, by the Primal Command of the Master.<BR>
 The slave realizes the Hukam of His Command, and submits to His Will forever.<BR>
 The Lord King Himself grants forgiveness; how glorious is His greatness! ||2||<BR>
 He Himself is True, and everything is True; this is revealed through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 He alone serves You, whom You have enjoined to do so.<BR>
 Without serving Him, no one finds Him; in duality and doubt, they are ruined. ||3||<BR>
 How could we forget Him from our minds? The gifts which he bestows increase day by day.<BR>
 Soul and body, all belong to Him; He infused the breath into us.<BR>
 If he shows His Mercy, then we serve Him; serving Him, we merge in Truth. ||4||<BR>
 He alone is the Lord's slave, who remains dead while yet alive, and eradicates egotism from within.<BR>
 His bonds are broken, the fire of his desire is quenched, and he is liberated.<BR>
 The treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is within all, but how rare are those who, as Gurmukh, obtain it. ||5||<BR>
 Within the Lord's slave, there is no virtue at all; the Lord's slave is totally unworthy.<BR>
 There is no Giver as great as You, Lord; You alone are the Forgiver.<BR>
 Your slave obeys the Hukam of Your Command; this is the most excellent action. ||6||<BR>
 The Guru is the pool of nectar in the world-ocean; whatever one desires, that fruit is obtained.<BR>
 The treasure of the Naam brings immortality; enshrine it in your heart and mind.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 024</H2></CENTER>
 Serving the Guru, eternal peace is obtained, by those whom the Lord inspires to obey the Hukam of His Command. ||7||<BR>
 Gold and silver, and all metals, mix with dust in the end<BR>
 Without the Name, nothing goes along with you; the True Guru has imparted this understanding.<BR>
 O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam are immaculate and pure; they remain merged in the Truth. ||8||5||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 The Order is issued, and he cannot remain; the permit to stay has been torn up.<BR>
 This mind is tied to its faults; it suffers terrible pain in its body.<BR>
 The Perfect Guru forgives all the mistakes of the beggar at His Door. ||1||<BR>
 How can he stay here? He must get up and depart. Contemplate the Word of the Shabad, and understand this.<BR>
 He alone is united, whom You, O Lord, unite. Such is the Primal Command of the Infinite Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 As You keep me, I remain; whatever You give me, I eat.<BR>
 As You lead me, I follow, with the Ambrosial Name in my mouth.<BR>
 All glorious greatness rests in the hands of my Lord and Master; my mind yearns to unite with You. ||2||<BR>
 Why should anyone praise any other created being? That Lord acts and sees.<BR>
 The One who created me, abides within my mind; there is no other at all.<BR>
 So praise that True Lord, and you shall be blessed with true honor. ||3||<BR>
 The Pandit, the religious scholar, reads, but does not reach the Lord; he is totally entangled in worldly affairs.<BR>
 He keeps the company of both virtue and vice, tormented by hunger and the Messenger of Death.<BR>
 One who is protected by the Perfect Lord, forgets separation and fear. ||4||<BR>
 They alone are perfect, O Siblings of Destiny, whose honor is certified.<BR>
 Perfect is the intellect of the Perfect Lord. True is His glorious greatness.<BR>
 His gifts never run short, although those who receive may grow weary of receiving. ||5||<BR>
 Searching the salty sea, one finds the pearl.<BR>
 It looks beautiful for a few days, but in the end, it is eaten away by dust.<BR>
 If one serves the Guru, the ocean of Truth, the gifts one receives never run short. ||6||<BR>
 They alone are pure, who are pleasing to my God; all others are soiled with filth.<BR>
 The filthy become pure, when they meet with the Guru, the Philosopher's Stone.<BR>
 Who can estimate the value of the color of the true jewel? ||7||<BR>
 Wearing religious robes, the Lord is not obtained, nor is He obtained by giving donations at sacred shrines of pilgrimage.<BR>
 Go and ask the readers of the Vedas; without faith, the world is cheated.<BR>
 O Nanak, he alone values the jewel, who is blessed with the spiritual wisdom of the Perfect Guru. ||8||6||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh, in a fit of passion, abandons his home, and is ruined; then, he spies on the homes of others.<BR>
 He neglects his household duties, and does not meet with the True Guru; he is caught in the whirlpool of evil-mindedness.<BR>
 Wandering in foreign lands and reading scriptures, he grows weary, and his thirsty desires only increase.<BR>
 His perishable body does not remember the Word of the Shabad; like a beast, he fills his belly. ||1||<BR>
 O Baba, this is the way of life of the Sannyaasi, the renunciate.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he is to enshrine love for the One Lord. Imbued with Your Name, Lord, he remains satisfied and fulfilled. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He dyes his robes with saffron dye, and wearing these robes, he goes out begging.<BR>
 Tearing his robes, he makes a patched coat, and puts the money in his wallet.<BR>
 From house to house he goes begging, and tries to teach the world; but his mind is blind, and so he loses his honor.<BR>
 He is deluded by doubt, and does not remember the Word of the Shabad. He loses his life in the gamble. ||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 025</H2></CENTER>
 Without the Guru, the fire within is not quenched; and outside, the fire still burns.<BR>
 Without serving the Guru, there is no devotional worship. How can anyone, by himself, know the Lord?<BR>
 Slandering others, one lives in hell; within him is hazy darkness.<BR>
 Wandering to the eixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, he is ruined. How can the filth of sin be washed away? ||3||<BR>
 He sifts through the dust, and applies ashes to his body, but he is searching for the path of Maya's wealth.<BR>
 Inwardly and outwardly, he does not know the One Lord; if someone tells him the Truth, he grows angry.<BR>
 He reads the scriptures, but tells lies; such is the intellect of one who has no guru.<BR>
 Without chanting the Naam, how can he find peace? Without the Name, how can he look good? ||4||<BR>
 Some shave their heads, some keep their hair in matted tangles; some keep it in braids, while some keep silent, filled with egotistical pride.<BR>
 Their minds waver and wander in ten directions, without loving devotion and enlightenment of the soul.<BR>
 They abandon the Ambrosial Nectar, and drink the deadly poison, driven mad by Maya.<BR>
 Past actions cannot be erased; without understanding the Hukam of the Lord's Command, they become beasts. ||5||<BR>
 With bowl in hand, wearing his patched coat, great desires well up in his mind.<BR>
 Abandoning his own wife, he is engrossed in sexual desire; his thoughts are on the wives of others.<BR>
 He teaches and preaches, but does not contemplate the Shabad; he is bought and sold on the street.<BR>
 With poison within, he pretends to be free of doubt; he is ruined and humiliated by the Messenger of Death. ||6||<BR>
 He alone is a Sannyaasi, who serves the True Guru, and removes his self-conceit from within.<BR>
 He does not ask for clothes or food; without asking, he accepts whatever he receives.<BR>
 He does not speak empty words; he gathers in the wealth of tolerance, and burns away his anger with the Naam.<BR>
 Blessed is such a householder, Sannyaasi and Yogi, who focuses his consciousness on the Lord's feet. ||7||<BR>
 Amidst hope, the Sannyaasi remains unmoved by hope; he remains lovingly focused on the One Lord.<BR>
 He drinks in the sublime essence of the Lord, and so finds peace and tranquility; in the home of his own being, he remains absorbed in the deep trance of meditation.<BR>
 His mind does not waver; as Gurmukh, he understands. He restrains it from wandering out.<BR>
 Following the Guru's Teachings, he searches the home of his body, and obtains the wealth of the Naam. ||8||<BR>
 Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are exalted, imbued with contemplative meditation on the Naam.<BR>
 The sources of creation, speech, the heavens and the underworld, all beings and creatures, are infused with Your Light.<BR>
 All comforts and liberation are found in the Naam, and the vibrations of the Guru's Bani; I have enshrined the True Name within my heart.<BR>
 Without the Naam, no one is saved; O Nanak, with the Truth, cross over to the other side. ||9||7||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 Through the union of mother and father, the fetus is formed. The egg and sperm join together to make the body.<BR>
 Upside-down within the womb, it lovingly dwells on the Lord; God provides for it, and gives it nourishment there. ||1||<BR>
 How can he cross over the terrifying world-ocean?<BR>
 The Gurmukh obtains the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord; the unbearable load of sins is removed. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I have forgotten Your Virtues, Lord; I am insane - what can I do now?<BR>
 You are the Merciful Giver, above the heads of all. Day and night, You give gifts, and take care of all. ||2||<BR>
 One is born to achieve the four great objectives of life. The spirit has taken up its home in the material world.<BR>

 Driven by hunger, it sees the path of Maya's riches; this emotional attachment takes away the treasure of liberation. ||3||<BR>
 Weeping and wailing, he does not receive them; he searches here and there, and grows weary.<BR>
 Engrossed in sexual desire, anger and egotism, he falls in love with his false relatives. ||4||<BR>
 He eats and enjoys, listens and watches, and dresses up to show off in this house of death.<BR>
 Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he does not undersand himself. Without the Lord's Name, death cannot be avoided. ||5||<BR>
 The more attachment and egotism delude and confuse him, the more he cries out, "Mine, mine!", and the more he loses out.<BR>
 His body and wealth pass away, and he is torn by skepticism and cynicism; in the end, he regrets and repents, when the dust falls on his face. ||6||<BR>
 He grows old, his body and youth waste away, and his throat is plugged with mucous; water flows from his eyes.<BR>
 He feet fail him, and his hands shake and tremble; the faithless cynic does not enshrine the Lord in his heart. ||7||<BR>
 His intellect fails him, his black hair turns white, and no one wants to keep him in their home.<BR>
 Forgetting the Naam, these are the stigmas which stick to him; the Messenger of Death beats him, and drags him to hell. ||8||<BR>
 The record of one's past actions cannot be erased; who else is to blame for one's birth and death?<BR>
 Without the Guru, life and death are pointless; without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, life just burns away. ||9||<BR>
 The pleasures enjoyed in happiness bring ruin; acting in corruption is useless indulgence.<BR>
 Forgetting the Naam, and caught by greed, he betrays his own source; the club of the Righteous Judge of Dharma will strike him over the head. ||10||<BR>
 The Gurmukhs sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name; the Lord God blesses them with His Glance of Grace.<BR>
 Those beings are pure, perfect unlimited and infinite; in this world, they are the embodiment of the Guru, the Lord of the Universe. ||11||<BR>
 Meditate in remembrance on the Lord; meditate and contemplate the Guru's Word, and love to associate with the humble servants of the Lord.<BR>
 The Lord's humble servants are the embodiment of the Guru; they are supreme and respected in the Court of the Lord. Nanak seeks the dust of the feet of those humble servants of the Lord. ||12||8||<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Maaroo, Kaafee, First Mehl, Second House:<BR>
 The double-minded person comes and goes, and has numerous friends.<BR>
 The soul-bride is separated from her Lord, and she has no place of rest; how can she be comforted? ||1||<BR>
 My mind is attuned to the Love of my Husband Lord.<BR>
 I am devoted, dedicated, a sacrifice to the Lord; if only He would bless me with His Glance of Grace, even for an instant! ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I am a rejected bride, abandoned in my parents' home; how can I go to my in-laws now?<BR>
 I wear my faults around my neck; without my Husband Lord, I am grieving, and wasting away to death. ||2||<BR>
 But if, in my parents' home, I remember my Husband Lord, then I will come to dwell in the home of my in-laws yet.<BR>
 The happy soul-brides sleep in peace; they find their Husband Lord, the treasure of virtue. ||3||<BR>
 Their blankets and mattresses are made of silk, and so are the clothes on their bodies.<BR>
 The Lord rejects the impure soul-brides. Their life-night passes in misery. ||4||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 027</H2></CENTER>
 I have tasted many flavors, and worn many robes,<BR>
 but without my Husband Lord, my youth is slipping away uselessly; I am separated from Him, and I cry out in pain. ||5||<BR>
 I have heard the True Lord's message, contemplating the Guru.<BR>
 True is the home of the True Lord; by His Gracious Grace, I love Him. ||6||<BR>
 The spiritual teacher applies the ointment of Truth to his eyes, and sees God, the Seer.<BR>
 The Gurmukh comes to know and understand; ego and pride are subdued. ||7||<BR>
 O Lord, You are pleased with those who are like Yourself; there are many more like me.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Husband does not separate from those who are imbued with Truth. ||8||1||9||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 Neither the sisters, nor the sisters-in-law, nor the mothers-in-law, shall remain.<BR>
 The true relationship with the Lord cannot be broken; it was established by the Lord, O sister soul-brides. ||1||<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to my Guru; I am forever a sacrifice to Him.<BR>
 Wandering so far without the Guru, I grew weary; now, the Guru has united me in Union with my Husband Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Aunts, uncles, grandparents and sisters-in-law<BR>
 - they all come and go; they cannot remain. They are like boatloads of passengers embarking. ||2||<BR>
 Uncles, aunts, and cousins of all sorts, cannot remain.<BR>
 The caravans are full, and great crowds of them are loading up at the riverbank. ||3||<BR>
 O sister-friends, my Husband Lord is dyed in the color of Truth.<BR>
 She who lovingly remembers her True Husband Lord is not separated from Him again. ||4||<BR>
 All the seasons are good, in which the soul-bride falls in love with the True Lord.<BR>
 That soul-bride, who knows her Husband Lord, sleeps in peace, night and day. ||5||<BR>
 At the ferry, the ferryman announces, "O travellers, hurry up and cross over."<BR>
 I have seen them crossing over there, on the boat of the True Guru. ||6||<BR>
 Some are getting on board, and some have already set out; some are weighed down with their loads.<BR>
 Those who deal in Truth, remain with their True Lord God. ||7||<BR>
 I am not called good, and I see none who are bad.<BR>
 O Nanak, one who conquers and subdues his ego, becomes just like the True Lord. ||8||2||10||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 I do not believe that anyone is foolish; I do not believe that anyone is clever.<BR>
 Imbued forever with the Love of my Lord and Master, I chant His Name, night and day. ||1||<BR>
 O Baba, I am so foolish, but I am a sacrifice to the Name.<BR>
 You are the Creator, You are wise and all-seeing. Through Your Name, we are carried across. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The same person is foolish and wise; the same light within has two names.<BR>
 The most foolish of the foolish are those who do not believe in the Name. ||2||<BR>
 Through the Guru's Gate, the Gurdwara, the Name is obtained. Without the True Guru, it is not received.<BR>
 Through the Pleasure of the True Guru's Will, the Name comes to dwell in the mind, and then, night and day, one remains lovingly absorbed in the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 In power, pleasures, beauty, wealth and youth, one gambles his life away.<BR>
 Bound by the Hukam of God's Command, the dice are thrown; he is just a piece in the game of chess. ||4||<BR>
 The world is clever and wise, but it is deluded by doubt, and forgets the Name; the Pandit, the religious scholar, studies the scriptures, but he is still a fool.<BR>
 Forgetting the Name, he dwells upon the Vedas; he writes, but he is confused by his poisonous corruption. ||5||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 028</H2></CENTER>
 He is like the crop planted in the salty soil, or the tree growing on the river bank, or the white clothes sprinkled with dirt.<BR>
 This world is the house of desire; whoever enters it, is burnt down by egotistical pride. ||6||<BR>
 Where are all the kings and their subjects? Those who are immersed in duality are destroyed.<BR>
 Says Nanak, these are the steps of the ladder, of the Teachings of the True Guru; only the Unseen Lord shall remain. ||7||3||11||<BR>
 Maaroo, Third Mehl, Fifth House, Ashtapadees:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 One whose mind is filled with the Lord's Love,<BR>
 is intuitively exalted by the True Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 He alone knows the pain of this love; what does anyone else know about its cure? ||1||<BR>
 He Himself unites in His Union.<BR>
 He Himself inspires us with His Love.<BR>
 He alone appreciates the value of Your Love, upon whom You shower Your Grace, O Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 One whose spiritual vision is awakened - his doubt is driven out.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, he obtains the supreme status.<BR>
 He alone is a Yogi, who understands this way, and contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||2||<BR>
 By good destiny, the soul-bride is united with her Husband Lord.<BR>
 Following the Guru's Teachings, she eradicates her evil-mindedness from within.<BR>
 With love, she continually enjoys pleasure with Him; she becomes the beloved of her Husband Lord. ||3||<BR>
 Other than the True Guru, there is no physician.<BR>
 He Himself is the Immaculate Lord.<BR>
 Meeting with the True Guru, evil is conquered, and spiritual wisdom is contemplated. ||4||<BR>
 One who is committed to this most sublime Shabad<BR>
 becomes Gurmukh, and is rid of thirst and hunger.<BR>
 By one's own efforts, nothing can be accomplished; the Lord, in His Mercy, bestows power. ||5||<BR>
 The True Guru has revealed the essence of the Shaastras and the Vedas.<BR>
 In His Mercy, He has come into the home of my self.<BR>
 In the midst of Maya, the Immaculate Lord is known, by those upon whom You bestow Your Grace. ||6||<BR>
 One who becomes Gurmukh, obtains the essence of reality;<BR>
 he eradictes his self-conceit from within.<BR>
 Without the True Guru, all are entangled in worldly affairs; consider this in your mind, and see. ||7||<BR>
 Some are deluded by doubt; they strut around egotistically.<BR>
 Some, as Gurmukh, subdue their egotism.<BR>
 Attuned to the True Word of the Shabad, they remain detached from the world. The other ignorant fools wander, confused and deluded by doubt. ||8||<BR>
 Those who have not become Gurmukh, and who have not found the Naam, the Name of the Lord<BR>
 - those self-willed manmukhs waste their lives uselessly.<BR>
 In the world hereafter, nothing except the Name will be of any assistance; this is understood by contemplating the Guru. ||9||<BR>
 The Ambrosial Naam is the Giver of peace forever.<BR>
 Throughout the four ages, it is known through the Perfect Guru.<BR>
 He alone receives it, unto whom You bestow it; this is the essence of reality which Nanak has realized. ||10||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 029</H2></CENTER>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl, Third House, Ashtapadees:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Wandering and roaming through 8.4 million incarnations, you have now been given this human life, so difficult to obtain. ||1||<BR>
 You fool! You are attached and clinging to such trivial pleasures!<BR>
 The Ambrosial Nectar abides with you, but you are engrossed in sin and corruption. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You have come to trade in gems and jewels, but you have loaded only barren soil. ||2||<BR>
 That home within which you live - you have not kept that home in your thoughts. ||3||<BR>
 He is immovable, indestructible, the Giver of peace to the soul; and yet you do not sing His Praises, even for an instant. ||4||<BR>
 You have forgotten that place where you must go; you have not attached your mind to the Lord, even for an instant. ||5||<BR>
 Gazing upon your children, spouse, household and paraphernalia, you are entangled in them. ||6||<BR>
 As God links the mortals, so are they linked, and so are the deeds they do. ||7||<BR>
 When He becomes Merciful, then the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is found; servant Nanak meditates on God. ||8||1||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Granting His Grace, He has protected me; I have found the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<BR>
 My tongue lovingly chants the Lord's Name; this love is so sweet and intense! ||1||<BR>
 He is the place of rest for my mind,<BR>
 my friend, companion, associate and relative; He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He created the world-ocean; I seek the Sanctuary of that God.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, I worship and adore God; the Messenger of Death can't say anything to me. ||2||<BR>
 Emancipation and liberation are at His Door; He is the treasure in the hearts of the Saints.<BR>
 The all-knowing Lord and Master shows us the true way of life; He is our Savior and Protector forever. ||3||<BR>
 Pain, suffering and troubles are eradicated, when the Lord abides in the mind.<BR>
 Death, hell and the most horrible dwelling of sin and corruption cannot even touch such a person. ||4||<BR>
 Wealth, miraculous spiritual powers and the nine treasures come from the Lord, as do the streams of Ambrosial Nectar.<BR>
 In the beginning, in the middle, and in the end, He is perfect, lofty, unapproachable and unfathomable. ||5||<BR>
 The Siddhas, seekers, angelic beings, silent sages, and the Vedas speak of Him.<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance on the Lord and Master, celestial peace is enjoyed; He has no end or limitation. ||6||<BR>
 Countless sins are erased in an instant, meditating on the Benevolent Lord within the heart.<BR>
 Such a person becomes the purest of the pure, and is blessed with the merits of millions of donations to charity and cleansing baths. ||7||<BR>
 God is power, intellect, understanding, the breath of life, wealth, and everything for the Saints.<BR>
 May I never forget Him from my mind, even for an instant - this is Nanak's prayer. ||8||2||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The sharp tool cuts down the tree, but it does not feel anger in its mind.<BR>
 It serves the purpose of the cutter, and does not blame him at all. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, continually, continuously, meditate on the Lord.<BR>
 The Lord of the Universe is merciful, divine and compassionate. Listen - this is the way of the Saints. ||1||Pause||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 030</H2></CENTER>
 He plants his feet in the boat, and then sits down in it; the fatigue of his body is relieved.<BR>
 The great ocean does not even affect him; in an instant, he arrives on the other shore. ||2||<BR>
 Sandalwood, aloe, and camphor-paste - the earth does not love them.<BR>
 But it doesn't mind, if someone digs it up bit by bit, and applies manure and urine to it. ||3||<BR>
 High and low, bad and good - the comforting canopy of the sky stretches evenly over all.<BR>
 It knows nothing of friend and enemy; all beings are alike to it. ||4||<BR>
 Blazing with its dazzling light, the sun rises, and dispels the darkness.<BR>
 Touching both the pure and the impure, it harbors no hatred to any. ||5||<BR>
 The cool and fragrant wind gently blows upon all places alike.<BR>
 Wherever anything is, it touches it there, and does not hesitate a bit. ||6||<BR>
 Good or bad, whoever comes close to the fire - his cold is taken away.<BR>
 It knows nothing of its own or others'; it is constant in the same quality. ||7||<BR>
 Whoever seeks the Sancuary of the feet of the Sublime Lord - his mind is attuned to the Love of the Beloved.<BR>
 Constantly singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the World, O Nanak, God becomes merciful to us. ||8||3||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl, Fourth House, Ashtapadees:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Moonlight, moonlight - in the courtyard of the mind, let the moonlight of God shine down. ||1||<BR>
 Meditation, meditation - sublime is meditation on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||2||<BR>
 Renunciation, renunciation - noble is the renunciation of sexual desire, anger and greed. ||3||<BR>
 Begging, begging - it is noble to beg for the Lord's Praise from the Guru. ||4||<BR>
 Vigils, vigils - sublime is the vigil spent singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises. ||5||<BR>
 Attachment, attachment - sublime is the attachment of the mind to the Guru's Feet. ||6||<BR>
 He alone is blessed with this way of life, upon whose forehead such destiny is recorded. ||7||<BR>
 Says Nanak, everything is sublime and noble, for one who enters the Sanctuary of God. ||8||1||4||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Please come, O please come into the home of my heart, that I may hear with my ears the Lord's Praises. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 With your coming, my soul and body are rejuvenated, and I sing with you the Lord's Praises. ||1||<BR>
 By the Grace of the Saint, the Lord dwells within the heart, and the love of duality is eradicated. ||2||<BR>
 By the kindness of the devotee, the intellect is enlightened, and pain and evil-mindedness are eradicated. ||3||<BR>
 Beholding the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, one is sanctified, and is no longer consigned to the womb of reincarnation. ||4||<BR>
 The nine treasures, wealth and miraculous spiritual powers are obtained, by one who is pleasing to Your mind. ||5||<BR>
 Without the Saint, I have no place of rest at all; I cannot think of any other place to go. ||6||<BR>
 I am unworthy; no one gives me sanctuary. But in the Society of the Saints, I merge in God. ||7||<BR>
 Says Nanak, the Guru has revealed this miracle; within my mind, I enjoy the Lord, Har, Har. ||8||2||5||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 031</H2></CENTER>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Fruitful is the life, the life of one who hears about the Lord, and chants and meditates on Him; he lives forever. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The real drink is that which satisfies the mind; this drink is the sublime essence of the Ambrosial Naam. ||1||<BR>
 The real food is that which will never leave you hungry again; it will leave you contented and satisfied forever. ||2||<BR>
 The real clothes are those which protect your honor before the Transcendent Lord, and do not leave you naked ever again. ||3||<BR>
 The real enjoyment within the mind is to be absorbed in the sublime essence of the Lord, in the Society of the Saints. ||4||<BR>
 Sew devotional worship to the Lord into the mind, without any needle or thread. ||5||<BR>
 Imbued and intoxicated with the sublime essence of the Lord, this experience will never wear off again. ||6||<BR>
 One is blessed with all treasures, when God, in His Mercy, gives them. ||7||<BR>
 O Nanak, service to the Saints beings peace; I drink in the wash water of the feet of the Saints. ||8||3||6||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl, Eighth House, Anjulees ~ With Hands Cupped In Prayer:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The household which is filled with abundance - that household suffers anxiety.<BR>
 One whose household has little, wanders around searching for more.<BR>
 He alone is happy and at peace, who is liberated from both conditions. ||1||<BR>
 Householders and kings fall into hell, along with renunciates and angry men,<BR>
 and all those who study and recite the Vedas in so many ways.<BR>
 Perfect is the work of that humble servant, who remains unattached while in the body. ||2||<BR>
 The mortal sleeps, even while he is awake; he is being plundered by doubt.<BR>
 Without the Guru, liberation is not obtained, friend.<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the bonds of egotism are released, and one comes to behold the One and only Lord. ||3||<BR>
 Doing deeds, one is placed in bondage; but if he does not act, he is slandered.<BR>
 Intoxicated with emotional attachment, the mind is afflicted with anxiety.<BR>
 One who looks alike upon pleasure and pain, by Guru's Grace, sees the Lord in each and every heart. ||4||<BR>
 Within the world, one is afflicted by skepticism;<BR>
 he does not know the imperceptible Unspoken Speech of the Lord.<BR>
 He alone understands, whom the Lord inspires to understand. The Lord cherishes him as His child. ||5||<BR>
 He may try to abandon Maya, but he is not released.<BR>
 If he collects things, then his mind is afraid of losing them.<BR>
 I wave the fly-brush over that holy person, whose honor is protected in the midst of Maya. ||6||<BR>
 He alone is a warrior hero, who remains dead to the world.<BR>
 One who runs away will wander in reincarnation.<BR>
 Whatever happens, accept that as good. Realize the Hukam of His Command, and your evil-mindedness will be burnt away. ||7||<BR>
 Whatever He links us to, to that we are linked.<BR>
 He acts, and does, and watches over His Creation.<BR>
 You are the Giver of peace, the Perfect Lord of Nanak; as You grant Your blessings, I dwell upon Your Name. ||8||1||7||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Beneath the tree, all beings have gathered.<BR>
 Some are hot-headed, and some speak very sweetly.<BR>
 Sunset has come, and they rise up and depart; their days have run their course and expired. ||1||<BR>
 Those who committed sins are sure to be ruined.<BR>
 Azraa-eel, the Angel of Death, seizes and tortures them.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 032</H2></CENTER>
 They are consigned to hell by the Creator Lord, and the Accountant calls them to give their account. ||2||<BR>
 No brothers or sisters can go with them.<BR>
 Leaving behind their property, youth and wealth, they march off.<BR>
 They do not know the kind and compassionate Lord; they shall be crushed like sesame seeds in the oil-press. ||3||<BR>
 You happily, cheerfully steal the possessions of others,<BR>
 but the Lord God is with you, watching and listening.<BR>
 Through worldly greed, you have fallen into the pit; you know nothing of the future. ||4||<BR>
 You shall be born and born again, and die and die again, only to be reincarnated again.<BR>
 You shall suffer terrible punishment, on your way to the land beyond.<BR>
 The mortal does not know the One who created him; he is blind, and so he shall suffer. ||5||<BR>
 Forgetting the Creator Lord, he is ruined.<BR>
 The drama of the world is bad; it brings sadness and then happiness.<BR>
 One who does not meet the Saint does not have faith or contentment; he wanders just as he pleases. ||6||<BR>
 The Lord Himself stages all this drama. Some, he lifts up, and some he throws into the waves.<BR>
 As He makes them dance, so do they dance. Everyone lives their lives according to their past actions. ||7||<BR>
 When the Lord and Master grants His Grace, then we meditate on Him.<BR>
 In the Society of the Saints, one is not consigned to hell.<BR>
 Please bless Nanak with the gift of the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord; he continually sings the songs of Your Glories. ||8||2||8||12||20||<BR>
 Maaroo, Solahas, First Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The True Lord is True; there is no other at all.<BR>
 He who created, shall in the end destroy.<BR>
 As it pleases You, so You keep me, and so I remain; what excuse could I offer to You? ||1||<BR>
 You Yourself create, and You Yourself destroy.<BR>
 You yourself link each and every person to their tasks.<BR>
 You contemplate Yourself, You Yourself make us worthy; You Yourself place us on the Path. ||2||<BR>
 You Yourself are all-wise, You Yourself are all-knowing.<BR>
 You Yourself created the Universe, and You are pleased.<BR>
 You Yourself are the air, water and fire; You Yourself unite in Union. ||3||<BR>
 You Yourself are the moon, the sun, the most perfect of the perfect.<BR>
 You Yourself are spiritual wisdom, meditation, and the Guru, the Warrior Hero.<BR>
 The Messenger of Death, and his noose of death, cannot touch one, who is lovingly focused on You, O True Lord. ||4||<BR>
 You Yourself are the male, and You Yourself are the female.<BR>
 You Yourself are the chess-board, and You Yourself are the chessman.<BR>
 You Yourself staged the drama in the arena of the world, and You Yourself evaluate the players. ||5||<BR>
 You Yourself are the bumble bee, the flower, the fruit and the tree.<BR>
 You Yourself are the water, the desert, the ocean and the pool.<BR>
 You Yourself are the great fish, the tortoise, the Cause of causes; Your form cannot be known. ||6||<BR>
 You Yourself are the day, and You Yourself are the night.<BR>
 You Yourself are pleased by the Word of the Guru's Bani.<BR>
 From the very beginning, and throughout the ages, the unstruck sound current resounds, night and day; in each and every heart, the Word of the Shabad, echoes Your Will. ||7||<BR>
 You Yourself are the jewel, incomparably beautiful and priceless.<BR>
 You Yourself are the Assessor, the Perfect Weigher.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 033</H2></CENTER>
 You Yourself test and forgive. You Yourself give and take, O Siblings of Destiny. ||8||<BR>
 He Himself is the bow, and He Himself is the archer.<BR>
 He Himself is all-wise, beautiful and all-knowing.<BR>
 He is the speaker, the orator and the listener. He Himself made what is made. ||9||<BR>
 Air is the Guru, and water is known to be the father.<BR>
 The womb of the great mother earth gives birth to all.<BR>
 Night and day are the two nurses, male and female; the world plays in this play. ||10||<BR>
 You Yourself are the fish, and You Yourself are the net.<BR>
 You Yourself are the cows, and You yourself are their keeper.<BR>
 Your Light fills all the beings of the world; they walk according to Your Command, O God. ||11||<BR>
 You Yourself are the Yogi, and You Yourself are the enjoyer.<BR>
 You Yourself are the reveller; You form the supreme Union.<BR>
 You Yourself are speechless, formless and fearless, absorbed in the primal ecstasy of deep meditation. ||12||<BR>
 The sources of creation and speech are contained within You, Lord.<BR>
 All that is seen, is coming and going.<BR>
 They are the true bankers and traders, whom the True Guru has inspired to understand. ||13||<BR>
 The Word of the Shabad is understood through the Perfect True Guru.<BR>
 The True Lord is overflowing with all powers.<BR>
 You are beyond our grasp, and forever independent. You do not have even an iota of greed. ||14||<BR>
 Birth and death are meaningless, for those<BR>
 who enjoy the sublime celestial essence of the Shabad within their minds.<BR>
 He Himself is the Giver of liberation, satisfaction and blessings, to those devotees who love Him in their minds. ||15||<BR>
 He Himself is immaculate; by contact with the Guru, spiritual wisdom is obtained.<BR>
 Whatever is seen, shall merge into You.<BR>
 Nanak, the lowly, begs for charity at Your Door; please, bless him with the glorious greatness of Your Name. ||16||1||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 He Himself is the earth, the mythical bull which supports it and the Akaashic ethers.<BR>
 The True Lord Himself reveals His Glorious Virtues.<BR>
 He Himself is celibate, chaste and contented; He Himself is the Doer of deeds. ||1||<BR>
 He who created the creation, beholds what He has created.<BR>
 No one can erase the Inscription of the True Lord.<BR>
 He Himself is the Doer, the Cause of causes; He Himself is the One who bestows glorious greatness. ||2||<BR>
 The five thieves cause the fickle consciousness to waver.<BR>
 It looks into the homes of others, but does not search its own home.<BR>
 The body-village crumbles into dust; without the Word of the Shabad, one's honor is lost. ||3||<BR>
 One who realizes the Lord through the Guru, comprehends the three worlds.<BR>
 He subdues his desires, and struggles with his mind.<BR>
 Those who serve You, become just like You; O Fearless Lord, You are their best friend from infancy. ||4||<BR>
 You Yourself are the heavenly realms, this world and the nether regions of the underworld.<BR>
 You Yourself are the embodiment of light, forever young.<BR>
 With matted hair, and a horrible, dreadful form, still, You have no form or feature. ||5||<BR>
 The Vedas and the Bible do not know the mystery of God.<BR>
 He has no mother, father, child or brother.<BR>
 He created all the mountains, and levels them again; the Unseen Lord cannot be seen. ||6||<BR>
 I have grown weary of making so many friends.<BR>
 No one can rid me of my sins and mistakes.<BR>
 God is the Supreme Lord and Master of all the angels and mortal beings; blessed with His Love, their fear is dispelled. ||7||<BR>
 He puts back on the Path those who have wandered and strayed.<BR>
 You Yourself make them stray, and You teach them again.<BR>
 I cannot see anything except the Name. Through the Name comes salvation and merit. ||8||<BR>

 The Ganges, the Jamunaa where Krishna played, Kaydar Naat'h,<BR>
 Benares, Kanchivaram, Puri, Dwaarkaa,<BR>
 Ganga Saagar where the Ganges empties into the ocean, Trivaynee where the three rivers come together, and the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, are all merged in the Lord's Being. ||9||<BR>
 He Himself is the Siddha, the seeker, in meditative contemplation.<BR>
 He Himself is the King and the Council.<BR>
 God Himself, the wise Judge, sits on the throne; He takes away doubt, duality and fear. ||10||<BR>
 He Himself is the Qazi; He Himself is the Mullah.<BR>
 He Himself is infallible; He never makes mistakes.<BR>
 He Himself is the Giver of Grace, compassion and honor; He is no one's enemy. ||11||<BR>

 He is the Giver of all; He does not have even an iota of greed.<BR>
 The Immaculate Lord is all pervading, permeating everywhere, both hidden and manifest. ||12||<BR>

 The True Creator Lord is the Enemy of ego.<BR>
 He unites those whom He blesses with His Grace; uniting them in His Union, they are united. ||13||<BR>
 Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva stand at His Door;<BR>
 they serve the unseen, infinite Lord.<BR>
 Millions of others can be seen crying at His door; I cannot even estimate their numbers. ||14||<BR>
 True is the Kirtan of His Praise, and True is the Word of His Bani.<BR>
 I can see no other in the Vedas and the Puraanas.<BR>
 Truth is my capital; I sing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. I have no other support at all. ||15||<BR>
 In each and every age, the True Lord is, and shall always be.<BR>
 Who has not died? Who shall not die?<BR>
 Nanak the lowly offers this prayer; see Him within your own self, and lovingly focus on the Lord. ||16||2||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 In duality and evil-mindedness, the soul-bride is blind and deaf.<BR>
 She wears the dress of sexual desire and anger.<BR>
 Her Husband Lord is within the home of her own heart, but she does not know Him; without her Husband Lord, she cannot go to sleep. ||1||<BR>
 The great fire of desire blazes within her.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh looks around in the four directions.<BR>
 Without serving the True Guru, how can she find peace? Glorious greatness rests in the hands of the True Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Eradicating sexual desire, anger and egotism,<BR>
 she destroys the five thieves through the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 Taking up the sword of spiritual wisdom, she struggles with her mind, and hope and desire are smoothed over in her mind. ||3||<BR>
 From the union of the mother's egg and the father's sperm,<BR>
 the form of infinite beauty has been created.<BR>
 The blessings of light all come from You; You are the Creator Lord, pervading everywhere. ||4||<BR>
 You have created birth and death.<BR>
 Why should anyone fear, if they come to understand through the Guru?<BR>
 When You, O Merciful Lord, look with Your kindness, then pain and suffering leave the body. ||5||<BR>
 One who sits in the home of his own self, eats his own fears.<BR>
 He quiets and holds his wandering mind still.<BR>
 His heart-lotus blossoms forth in the overflowing green pool, and the Lord of his soul becomes his companion and helper. ||6||<BR>
 With their death already ordained, mortals come into this world.<BR>
 How can they remain here? They have to go to the world beyond.<BR>
 True is the Lord's Command; the true ones dwell in the eternal city. The True Lord blesses them with glorious greatness. ||7||<BR>
 He Himself created the whole world.<BR>
 The One who made it, assigns the tasks to it.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 035</H2></CENTER>
 I cannot see any other above the True Lord. The True Lord does the appraisal. ||8||<BR>
 In this green pasture, the mortal stays only a few days.<BR>
 He plays and frolics in utter darkness.<BR>
 The jugglers have staged their show, and left, like people mumbling in a dream. ||9||<BR>
 They alone are blessed with glorious greatness at the Lord's throne,<BR>
 who enshrine the fearless Lord in their minds, and lovingly center themselves on Him.<BR>
 In the galaxies and solar systems, nether regions, celestial realms and the three worlds, the Lord is in the primal void of deep absorption. ||10||<BR>
 True is the village, and true is the throne,<BR>
 of those Gurmukhs who meet with the True Lord, and find peace.<BR>
 In Truth, seated upon the true throne, they are blessed with glorious greatness; their egotism is eradicated, along with the calculation of their account. ||11||<BR>
 Calculating its account, the soul becomes anxious.<BR>
 How can one find peace, through duality and the three gunas - the three qualities?<BR>
 The One Lord is immaculate and formless, the Great Giver; through the Perfect Guru, honor is obtained. ||12||<BR>
 In each and every age, very rare are those who, as Gurmukh, realize the Lord.<BR>
 Their minds are imbued with the True, all-pervading Lord.<BR>
 Seeking His Shelter, they find peace, and their minds and bodies are not stained with filth. ||13||<BR>
 Their tongues are imbued with the True Lord, the source of nectar;<BR>
 abiding with the Lord God, they have no fear or doubt.<BR>
 Hearing the Word of the Guru's Bani, their ears are satisfied, and their light merges into the Light. ||14||<BR>
 Carefully, carefully, I place my feet upon the ground.<BR>
 Wherever I go, I behold Your Sanctuary.<BR>
 Whether You grant me pain or pleasure, You are pleasing to my mind. I am in harmony with You. ||15||<BR>
 No one is anyone's companion or helper at the very last moment;<BR>
 as Gurmukh, I realize You and praise You.<BR>
 O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, I am detached; in the home of my own self deep within, I am absorbed in the primal void of deep meditation. ||16||3||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 From the very beginning of time, and throughout the ages, You are infinite and incomparable.<BR>
 You are my primal, immaculate Lord and Master.<BR>
 I contemplate the Way of Yoga, the Way of Union with the True Lord. I am truly absorbed in the primal void of deep meditation. ||1||<BR>
 For so many ages, there was only pitch darkness;<BR>
 the Creator Lord was absorbed in the primal void.<BR>
 There was the True Name, the glorious greatness of the Truth, and the glory of His true throne. ||2||<BR>
 In the Golden Age of Truth, Truth and contentment filled the bodies.<BR>
 Truth was pervasive, Truth, deep, profound and unfathomable.<BR>
 The True Lord appraises the mortals on the Touchstone of Truth, and issues His True Command. ||3||<BR>
 The Perfect True Guru is true and contented.<BR>
 He alone is a spiritual hero, who believes in the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 He alone obtains a true seat in the True Court of the Lord, who surrenders to the Command of the Commander. ||4||<BR>
 In the Golden Age of Truth, everyone spoke the Truth.<BR>
 Truth was pervasive - the Lord was Truth.<BR>
 With Truth in their minds and mouths, mortals were rid of doubt and fear. Truth was the friend of the Gurmukhs. ||5||<BR>
 In the Silver Age of Traytaa Yoga, one power of Dharma was lost.<BR>
 Three feet remained; through duality, one was cut off.<BR>
 Those who were Gurmukh spoke the Truth, while the self-willed manmukhs wasted away in vain. ||6||<BR>
 The manmukh never succeeds in the Court of the Lord.<BR>
 Without the Word of the Shabad, how can one be pleased within?<BR>
 In bondage they come, and in bondage they go; they understand and comprehend nothing. ||7||<BR>
 In the Brass Age of Dwaapur Yuga, compassion was cut in half.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 036</H2></CENTER>
 Only a few, as Gurmukh, remembered the Lord.<BR>
 Dharmic faith, which upholds and supports the earth, had only two feet; Truth was revealed to the Gurmukhs. ||8||<BR>
 The kings acted righteously only out of self-interest.<BR>
 Tied to hopes of reward, they gave to charities.<BR>
 Without the Lord's Name, liberation did not come, although they grew weary of performing rituals. ||9||<BR>
 Practicing religious rituals, they sought liberation,<BR>
 but the treasure of liberation comes only by praising the Shabad.<BR>
 Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, liberation is not obtained; practicing hypocrisy, they wander around confused. ||10||<BR>
 Love and attachment to Maya cannot be abandoned.<BR>
 They alone find release, who practice deeds of Truth.<BR>
 Day and night, the devotees remain imbued with contemplative meditation; they become just like their Lord and Master. ||11||<BR>
 Some chant and practice intensive meditation, and take cleansing baths at sacred shrines of pilgrimage.<BR>
 They walk as You will them to walk.<BR>
 By stubborn rituals of self-suppression, the Lord is not pleased. No one has ever obtained honor, without the Lord, without the Guru. ||12||<BR>
 In the Iron Age, the Dark Age of Kali Yuga, only one power remains.<BR>
 Without the Perfect Guru, no one has even described it.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs have staged the show of falsehood. Without the True Guru, doubt does not depart. ||13||<BR>
 The True Guru is the Creator Lord, independent and carefree.<BR>
 He does not fear death, and He is not dependent on mortal men.<BR>
 Whoever serves Him becomes immortal and imperishable, and will not be tortured by death. ||14||<BR>
 The Creator Lord has enshrined Himself within the Guru.<BR>
 The Gurmukh saves countless millions.<BR>
 The Life of the World is the Great Giver of all beings. The Fearless Lord has no filth at all. ||15||<BR>
 Everyone begs from the Guru, God's Treasurer.<BR>
 He Himself is the immaculate, unknowable, infinite Lord.<BR>
 Nanak speaks the Truth; he begs from God. Please bless me with the Truth, by Your Will. ||16||4||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 The True Lord unites with those who are united with the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 When it pleases Him, we intuitively merge with Him.<BR>
 The Light of the Transcendent Lord pervades the three worlds; there is no other at all, O Siblings of Destiny. ||1||<BR>
 I am His servant; I serve Him.<BR>
 He is unknowable and mysterious; He is pleased by the Shabad.<BR>
 The Creator is the Benefactor of His devotees. He forgives them - such is His greatness. ||2||<BR>
 The True Lord gives and gives; His blessings never run short.<BR>
 The false ones receive, and then deny having received.<BR>
 They do not understand their origins, they are not pleased with the Truth, and so they wander in duality and doubt. ||3||<BR>
 The Gurmukhs remain awake and aware, day and night.<BR>
 Following the Guru's Teachings, they know the Love of the True Lord.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs remain asleep, and are plundered. The Gurmukhs remain safe and sound, O Siblings of Destiny. ||4||<BR>
 The false come, and the false go;<BR>
 imbued with falsehood, they practice only falsehood.<BR>
 Those who are imbued with the Shabad are robed in honor in the Court of the Lord; the Gurmukhs focus their consciousness on Him. ||5||<BR>
 The false are cheated, and robbed by the robbers.<BR>
 The garden is laid waste, like the rough wilderness.<BR>
 Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, nothing tastes sweet; forgetting the Lord, they suffer in sorrow. ||6||<BR>
 Receiving the food of Truth, one is satisfied.<BR>
 True is the glorious greatness of the jewel of the Name.<BR>
 One who understands his own self, realizes the Lord. His light merges into the Light. ||7||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 037</H2></CENTER>
 Wandering from the Name, he endures beatings.<BR>
 Even great cleverness does not dispel doubt.<BR>
 The unconscious fool does not remain conscious of the Lord; he putrifies and rots away to death, carrying his heavy load of sin. ||8||<BR>
 No one is free of conflict and strife.<BR>
 Show me anyone who is, and I will praise him.<BR>
 Dedicating mind and body to God, one meets the Lord, the Life of the World, and becomes just like Him. ||9||<BR>
 No one knows the state and extent of God.<BR>
 Whoever calls himself great, will be eaten by his greatness.<BR>
 There is no lack of gifts of our True Lord and Master. He created all. ||10||<BR>
 Great is the glorious greatness of the independent Lord.<BR>
 He Himself created, and gives sustanance to all.<BR>
 The Merciful Lord is not far away; the Great Giver spontaneously unites with Himself, by His Will. ||11||<BR>
 Some are sad, and some are afflicted with disease.<BR>
 Whatever God does, He does by Himself.<BR>
 Through loving devotion, and the Perfect Teachings of the Guru, the unstruck sound current of the Shabad is realized. ||12||<BR>
 Some wander and roam around, hungry and naked.<BR>
 Some act in stubbornness and die, but do not know the value of God.<BR>
 They do not know the difference between good and bad; this is understood only through the practice of the Word of the Shabad. ||13||<BR>
 Some bathe at sacred shrines and refuse to eat.<BR>
 Some torment their bodies in burning fire.<BR>
 Without the Lord's Name, liberation is not obtained; how can anyone cross over? ||14||<BR>
 Abandoning the Guru's Teachings, some wander in the wilderness.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs are destitute; they do not meditate on the Lord.<BR>
 They are ruined, destroyed and drowned from practicing falsehood; death is the enemy of the false. ||15||<BR>
 By the Hukam of the Lord's Command, they come, and by the Hukam of His Command, they go.<BR>
 One who realizes His Hukam, merges in the True Lord.<BR>
 O Nanak, he merges in the True Lord, and his mind is pleased with the Lord. The Gurmukhs do His work. ||16||5||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 He Himself is the Creator Lord, the Architect of Destiny.<BR>
 He evaluates those whom He Himself has created.<BR>
 He Himself is the True Guru, and He Himself is the servant; He Himself created the Universe. ||1||<BR>
 He is near at hand, not far away.<BR>
 The Gurmukhs understand Him; perfect are those humble beings.<BR>
 Associating with them night and day is profitable. This is the glorious greatness of associating with the Guru. ||2||<BR>
 Throughout the ages, Your Saints are holy and sublime, O God.<BR>
 They sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, savoring it with their tongues.<BR>
 They chant His Praises, and their pain and poverty are taken away; they are not afraid of anyone else. ||3||<BR>
 They remain awake and aware, and do not appear to sleep.<BR>
 They serve up Truth, and so save their companions and relatives.<BR>
 They are not stained with the filth of sins; they are immaculate and pure, and remain absorbed in loving devotional worship. ||4||<BR>
 O humble servants of the Lord, understand the Word of the Guru's Bani.<BR>
 This youth, breath and body shall pass away.<BR>
 O mortal, you shall die today or tomorrow; chant, and meditate on the Lord within your heart. ||5||<BR>
 O mortal, abandon falsehood and your worthless ways.<BR>
 Death viciously kills the false beings.<BR>
 The faithless cynic is ruined through falsehood and his egotistical mind.On the path of duality, he rots away and decomposes. ||6||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 038</H2></CENTER>
 Abandon slander and envy of others.<BR>
 Reading and studying, they burn, and do not find tranquility.<BR>
 Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The Lord, the Supreme Soul, shall be your helper and companion. ||7||<BR>
 Abandon sexual desire, anger and wickedness.<BR>
 Abandon your involvement in egotistical affairs and conflicts.<BR>
 If you seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru, then you shall be saved. In this way you shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean, O Siblings of Destiny. ||8||<BR>
 In the hereafter, you shall have to cross over the fiery river of poisonous flames.<BR>
 No one else will be there; your soul shall be all alone.<BR>
 The ocean of fire spits out waves of searing flames; the self-willed manmukhs fall into it, and are roasted there. ||9||<BR>
 Liberation comes from the Guru; He grants this blessing by the Pleasure of His Will.<BR>
 He alone knows the way, who obtains it.<BR>
 So ask one who has obtained it, O Siblings of Destiny. Serve the True Guru, and find peace. ||10||<BR>
 Without the Guru, he dies entangled in sin and corruption.<BR>
 The Messenger of Death smashes his head and humiliates him.<BR>
 The slanderous person is not freed of his bonds; he is drowned, slandering others. ||11||<BR>
 So speak the Truth, and realize the Lord deep within.<BR>
 He is not far away; look, and see Him.<BR>
 No obstacles shall block your way; become Gurmukh, and cross over to the other side. This is the way to cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||12||<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within the body.<BR>
 The Creator Lord is eternal and imperishable.<BR>
 The soul does not die, and it cannot be killed; God creates and watches over all. Through the Word of the Shabad, His Will is manifest. ||13||<BR>
 He is immaculate, and has no darkness.<BR>
 The True Lord Himself sits upon His throne.<BR>
 The faithless cynics are bound and gagged, and forced to wander in reincarnation. They die, and are reborn, and continue coming and going. ||14||<BR>
 The Guru's servants are the Beloveds of the True Guru.<BR>
 Contemplating the Shabad, they sit upon His throne.<BR>
 They realize the essence of reality, and know the state of their inner being. This is the true glorious greatness of those who join the Sat Sangat. ||15||<BR>
 He Himself saves His humble servant, and saves his ancestors as well.<BR>
 His companions are liberated; He carries them across.<BR>
 Nanak is the servant and slave of that Gurmukh who lovingly focuses his consciousness on the Lord. ||16||6||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 For many ages, only darkness prevailed;<BR>
 the infinite, endless Lord was absorbed in the primal void.<BR>
 He sat alone and unaffected in absolute darkness; the world of conflict did not exist. ||1||<BR>
 Thirty-six ages passed like this.<BR>
 He causes all to happen by the Pleasure of His Will.<BR>
 No rival of His can be seen. He Himself is infinite and endless. ||2||<BR>
 God is hidden throughout the four ages - understand this well.<BR>
 He pervades each and every heart, and is contained within the belly.<BR>
 The One and Only Lord prevails throughout the ages. How rare are those who contemplate the Guru, and understand this. ||3||<BR>
 From the union of the sperm and the egg, the body was formed.<BR>
 From the union of air, water and fire, the living being is made.<BR>
 He Himself plays joyfully in the mansion of the body; all the rest is just attachment to Maya's expanse. ||4||<BR>
 Within the mother's womb, upside-down, the mortal meditated on God.<BR>
 The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, knows everything.<BR>
 With each and every breath, he contemplated the True Name, deep within himself, within the womb. ||5||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 039</H2></CENTER>
 He came into the world to obtain the four great blessings.<BR>
 He came to dwell in the home of the Shiva and Shakti, energy and matter.<BR>
 But he forgot the One Lord, and he has lost the game. The blind person forgets the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||6||<BR>
 The child dies in his childish games.<BR>
 They cry and mourn, saying that he was such a playful child.<BR>
 The Lord who owns him has taken him back. Those who weep and mourn are mistaken. ||7||<BR>
 What can they do, if he dies in his youth?<BR>
 They cry out, "His is mine, he is mine!"<BR>
 They cry for the sake of Maya, and are ruined; their lives in this world are cursed. ||8||<BR>
 Their black hair eventually turns grey.<BR>
 Without the Name, they lose their wealth, and then leave.<BR>
 They are evil-minded and blind - they are totally ruined; they are plundered, and cry out in pain. ||9||<BR>
 One who understands himself, does not cry.<BR>
 When he meets the True Guru, then he understands.<BR>
 Without the Guru, the heavy, hard doors are not opened. Obtaining the Word of the Shabad, one is emancipated. ||10||<BR>
 The body grows old, and is beaten out of shape.<BR>
 But he does not meditate on the Lord, His only friend, even at the end.<BR>
 Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he departs with his face blackened. The false are humiliated in the Court of the Lord. ||11||<BR>
 Forgetting the Naam, the false ones depart.<BR>
 Coming and going, dust falls on their heads.<BR>
 The soul-bride finds no home in her in-laws' home, the world hereafter; she suffers in agony in this world of her parents' home. ||12||<BR>
 She eats, dresses and plays joyfully,<BR>
 but without loving devotional worship of the Lord, she dies uselessly.<BR>
 One who does not distinguish between good and evil, is beaten by the Messenger of Death; how can anyone escape this? ||13||<BR>
 One who realizes what he has to possess, and what he has to abandon,<BR>
 associating with the Guru, comes to know the Word of the Shabad, within the home of his own self.<BR>
 Do not call anyone else bad; follow this way of life. Those who are true are judged to be genuine by the True Lord. ||14||<BR>
 Without Truth, no one succeeds in the Court of the Lord.<BR>
 Through the True Shabad, one is robed in honor.<BR>
 He forgives those with whom He is pleased; they silence their egotism and pride. ||15||<BR>
 One who realizes the Hukam of God's Command, by the Grace of the Guru,<BR>
 comes to know the lifestyle of the ages.<BR>
 O Nanak, chant the Naam, and cross over to the other side. The True Lord will carry you across. ||16||1||7||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 I have no other friend like the Lord.<BR>
 He gave me body and mind, and infused consciousness into my being.<BR>
 He cherishes and cares for all beings; He is deep within, the wise, all-knowing Lord. ||1||<BR>
 The Guru is the sacred pool, and I am His beloved swan.<BR>
 In the ocean, there are so many jewels and rubies.<BR>
 The Lord's Praises are pearls, gems and diamonds. Singing His Praises, my mind and body are drenched with His Love. ||2||<BR>
 The Lord is inaccessible, inscrutable, unfathomable and unattached.<BR>
 The Lord's limits cannot be found; the Guru is the Lord of the World.<BR>
 Through the Teachings of the True Guru, the Lord carries us across to the other side. He unites in His Union those who are colored by His Love. ||3||<BR>
 Without the True Guru, how can anyone be liberated?<BR>
 He has been the Friend of the Lord, from the very beginning of time, and all throughout the ages.<BR>
 By His Grace, He grants liberation in His Court; He forgives them for their sins. ||4||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 040</H2></CENTER>
 The True Guru, the Giver, grants liberation;<BR>
 all diseases are eradicated, and one is blessed with the Ambrosial Nectar.<BR>
 Death, the tax collector, does not impose any tax on one whose inner fire has been put out, whose heart is cool and tranquil. ||5||<BR>
 The body has developed a great love for the soul-swan.<BR>
 He is a Yogi, and she is a beautiful woman.<BR>
 Day and night, he enjoys her with delight, and then he arises and departs without consulting her. ||6||<BR>
 Creating the Universe, God remains diffused throughout it.<BR>
 In the wind, water and fire, He vibrates and resounds.<BR>
 The mind wavers, keeping company with evil passions; one obtains the rewards of his own actions. ||7||<BR>
 Forgetting the Naam, one suffers the misery of his evil ways.<BR>
 When the order to depart is issued, how can he remain here?<BR>
 He falls into the pit of hell, and suffers like a fish out of water. ||8||<BR>
 The faithless cynic has to endure 8.4 million hellish incarnations.<BR>
 As he acts, so does he suffer.<BR>
 Without the True Guru, there is no liberation. Bound and gagged by his own actions, he is helpless. ||9||<BR>
 This path is very narrow, like the sharp edge of a sword.<BR>
 When his account is read, he shall be crushed like the sesame seed in the mill.<BR>
 Mother, father, spouse and child - none is anyone's friend in the end. Without the Lord's Love, no one is liberated. ||10||<BR>
 You may have many friends and companions in the world,<BR>
 but without the Guru, the Transcendent Lord Incarnate, there is no one at all.<BR>
 Service to the Guru is the way to liberation. Night and day, sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises. ||11||<BR>
 Abandon falsehood, and pursue the Truth,<BR>
 and you shall obtain the fruits of your desires.<BR>
 Very few are those who trade in the merchandise of Truth. Those who deal in it, obtain the true profit. ||12||<BR>
 Depart with the merchandise of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,<BR>
 and you shall intuitively obtain the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, in the Mansion of His Presence.<BR>
 The Gurmukhs search for Him and find Him; they are the perfect humble beings. In this way, they see Him, who looks upon all alike. ||13||<BR>
 God is endless; following the Guru's Teachings, some find Him.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they instruct their minds.<BR>
 Accept as True, Perfectly True, the Word of the True Guru's Bani. In this way, you shall merge in the Lord, the Supreme Soul. ||14||<BR>
 Naarad and Saraswati are Your servants.<BR>
 Your servants are the greatest of the great, throughout the three worlds.<BR>
 Your creative power permeates all; You are the Great Giver of all. You created the whole creation. ||15||<BR>
 Some serve at Your Door, and their sufferings are dispelled.<BR>
 They are robed with honor in the Court of the Lord, and emancipated by the True Guru.<BR>
 The True Guru breaks the bonds of egotism, and restrains the fickle consciousness. ||16||<BR>
 Meet the True Guru, and search for the way,<BR>
 by which you may find God, and not have to answer for your account.<BR>
 Subdue your egotism, and serve the Guru; O servant Nanak, you shall be drenched with the Lord's Love. ||17||2||8||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 My Lord is the Destroyer of demons.<BR>
 My Beloved Lord is pervading each and every heart.<BR>
 The unseen Lord is always with us, but He is not seen at all. The Gurmukh contemplates the record. ||1||<BR>
 The Holy Gurmukh seeks Your Sanctuary.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 041</H2></CENTER>
 God grants His Grace, and carries him across to the other side.<BR>
 The ocean is very deep, filled with fiery water; the Guru, the True Guru, carries us across to the other side. ||2||<BR>
 The blind, self-willed manmukh does not understand.<BR>
 He comes and goes in reincarnation, dying, and dying again.<BR>
 The primal inscription of destiny cannot be erased. The spiritually blind suffer terribly at Death's door. ||3||<BR>
 Some come and go, and do not find a home in their own heart.<BR>
 Bound by their past actions, they commit sins.<BR>
 The blind ones have no understanding, no wisdom; they are trapped and ruined by greed and egotism. ||4||<BR>
 Without her Husband Lord, what good are the soul-bride's decorations?<BR>
 She has forgotten her Lord and Master, and is infatuated with another's husband.<BR>
 Just as no one knows who is the father of the prostitute's son, such are the worthless, useless deeds that are done. ||5||<BR>
 The ghost, in the body-cage, suffers all sorts of afflictions.<BR>
 Those who are blind to spiritual wisdom, putrefy in hell.<BR>
 The Righteous Judge of Dharma collects the balance due on the account, of those who forget the Name of the Lord. ||6||<BR>
 The scorching sun blazes with flames of poison.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh is dishonored, a beast, a demon.<BR>
 Trapped by hope and desire, he practices falsehood, and is afflicted by the terrible disease of corruption. ||7||<BR>
 He carries the heavy load of sins on his forehead and head.<BR>
 How can he cross the terrifying world-ocean?<BR>
 From the very beginning of time, and throughout the ages, the True Guru has been the boat; through the Lord's Name, He carries us across. ||8||<BR>
 The love of one's children and spouse is so sweet in this world.<BR>
 The expansive expanse of the Universe is attachment to Maya.<BR>
 The True Guru snaps the noose of Death, for that Gurmukh who contemplates the essence of reality. ||9||<BR>
 Cheated by falsehood, the self-willed manmukh walks along many paths;<BR>
 he may be highly educated, but he burns in the fire.<BR>
 The Guru is the Great Giver of the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord. Chanting the Naam, sublime peace is obtained. ||10||<BR>
 The True Guru, in His Mercy, implants Truth within.<BR>
 All suffering is eradicated, and one is placed on the Path.<BR>
 Not even a thorn ever pierces the foot of one who has the True Guru as his Protector. ||11||<BR>
 Dust mixes with dust, when the body wastes away.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh is like a stone slab, which is impervious to water.<BR>
 He cries out and weeps and wails; he is reincarnated into heaven and then hell. ||12||<BR>
 They live with the poisonous snake of Maya.<BR>
 This duality has ruined so many homes.<BR>
 Without the True Guru, love does not well up. Imbued with devotional worship, the soul is satisfied. ||13||<BR>
 The faithless cynics chase after Maya.<BR>
 Forgetting the Naam, how can they find peace?<BR>
 In the three qualities, they are destroyed; they cannot cross over to the other side. ||14||<BR>
 The false are called pigs and dogs.<BR>
 They bark themselves to death; they bark and bark and howl in fear.<BR>
 False in mind and body, they practice falsehood; through their evil-mindedness, they lose out in the Court of the Lord. ||15||<BR>
 Meeting the True Guru, the mind is stabilized.<BR>
 One who seeks His Sanctuary is blessed with the Lord's Name.<BR>
 They are given the priceless wealth of the Lord's Name; singing His Praises, they are His beloveds in His court. ||16||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 042</H2></CENTER>
 In the Sanctuary of the Holy, chant the Lord's Name.<BR>
 Through the True Guru's Teachings, one comes to know His state and extent.<BR>
 Nanak: chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my mind; the Lord, the Uniter, shall unite you with Himself. ||17||3||9||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 Remain in your own home, O my foolish and ignorant mind.<BR>
 Meditate on the Lord - concentrate deep within your being and meditate on Him.<BR>
 Renounce your greed, and merge with the infinite Lord. In this way, you shall find the door of liberation. ||1||<BR>
 If you forget Him, the Messenger of Death will catch sight of you.<BR>
 All peace will be gone, and you will suffer in pain in the world hereafter.<BR>
 Chant the Name of the Lord as Gurmukh, O my soul; this is the supreme essence of contemplation. ||2||<BR>
 Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the sweetest essence.<BR>
 As Gurmukh, see the essence of the Lord deep within.<BR>
 Day and night, remain imbued with the Lord's Love. This is the essence of all chanting, deep meditation and self-discipline. ||3||<BR>
 Speak the Guru's Word, and the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 In the Society of the Saints, search for this essence.<BR>
 Follow the Guru's Teachings - seek and find the home of your own self, and you shall never be consigned to the womb of reincarnation again. ||4||<BR>
 Bathe at the sacred shrine of Truth, and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<BR>
 Reflect upon the essence of reality, and lovingly focus your consciousness on the Lord.<BR>
 At the very last moment, the Messenger of Death will not be able to touch you, if you chant the Name of the Beloved Lord. ||5||<BR>
 The True Guru, the Primal Being, the Great Giver, is all-knowing.<BR>
 Whoever has Truth within himself, merges in the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 One whom the True Guru unites in Union, is rid of the overpowering fear of death. ||6||<BR>
 The body is formed from the union of the five elements.<BR>
 Know that the Lord's jewel is within it.<BR>
 The soul is the Lord, and the Lord is the soul; contemplating the Shabad, the Lord is found. ||7||<BR>
 Abide in truth and contentment, O humble Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 Hold tight to compassion and the Sanctuary of the True Guru.<BR>
 Know your soul, and know the Supreme Soul; associating with the Guru, you shall be emancipated. ||8||<BR>
 The faithless cynics are stuck in falsehood and deceit.<BR>
 Day and night, they slander many others.<BR>
 Without meditative remembrance, they come and then go, and are cast into the hellish womb of reincarnation. ||9||<BR>
 The faithless cynic is not rid of his fear of death.<BR>
 The Messenger of Death's club is never taken away.<BR>
 He has to answer to the Righteous Judge of Dharma for the account of his actions; the egotistical being carries the unbearable load. ||10||<BR>
 Tell me: without the Guru, what faithless cynic has been saved?<BR>
 Acting egotistically, he falls into the terrifying world-ocean.<BR>
 Without the Guru, no one is saved; meditating on the Lord, they are carried across to the other side. ||11||<BR>
 No one can erase the Guru's blessings.<BR>
 The Lord carries across those whom He forgives.<BR>
 The pains of birth and death do not even approach those whose minds are filled with God, the infinite and endless. ||12||<BR>
 Those who forget the Guru come and go in reincarnation.<BR>
 They are born, only to die again, and continue committing sins.<BR>
 The unconscious, foolish, faithless cynic does not remember the Lord; but when he is stricken with pain, then he cries out for the Lord. ||13||<BR>
 Pleasure and pain are the consequences of the actions of past lives.<BR>
 The Giver, who blesses us with these - He alone knows.<BR>
 So who can you blame, O mortal being? The hardships you suffer are from your own actions. ||14||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 043</H2></CENTER>
 Practicing egotism and possessiveness, you have come into the world.<BR>
 Hope and desire bind you and lead you on.<BR>
 Indulging in egotism and self-conceit, what will you be able to carry with you, except the load of ashes from poison and corruption? ||15||<BR>
 Worship the Lord in devotion, O humble Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 Speak the Unspoken Speech, and the mind will merge back into the Mind.<BR>
 Restrain your restless mind within its own home, and the Lord, the Destroyer, shall destroy your pain. ||16||<BR>
 I seek the support of the Perfect Guru, the Lord.<BR>
 The Gurmukh loves the Lord; the Gurmukh realizes the Lord.<BR>
 O Nanak, through the Lord's Name, the intellect is exalted; granting His forgiveness, the Lord carries him across to the other side. ||17||4||10||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 O Divine Guru, I have entered Your Sanctuary.<BR>
 You are the Almighty Lord, the Merciful Lord.<BR>
 No one knows Your wondrous plays; You are the perfect Architect of Destiny. ||1||<BR>
 From the very beginning of time, and throughout the ages, You cherish and sustain Your beings.<BR>
 You are in each and every heart, O Merciful Lord of incomparable beauty.<BR>
 As You will, You cause all to walk; everyone acts according to Your Command. ||2||<BR>
 Deep within the nucleus of all, is the Light of the Life of the World.<BR>
 The Lord enjoys the hearts of all, and drinks in their essence.<BR>
 He Himself gives, and He himself takes; He is the generous father of the beings of the three worlds. ||3||<BR>
 Creating the world, He has set His play into motion.<BR>
 He placed the soul in the body of air, water and fire.<BR>
 The body-village has nine gates; the Tenth Gate remains hidden. ||4||<BR>
 There are four horrible rivers of fire.<BR>
 How rare is that Gurmukh who understands this, and through the Word of the Shabad, remains unattached.<BR>
 The faithless cynics are drowned and burnt through their evil-mindedness. The Guru saves those who are imbued with the Love of the Lord. ||5||<BR>
 Water, fire, air, earth and ether<BR>
 - in that house of the five elements, they dwell.<BR>
 Those who remain imbued with the Word of the True Guru's Shabad, renounce Maya, egotism and doubt. ||6||<BR>
 This mind is drenched with the Shabad, and satisfied.<BR>
 Without the Name, what support can anyone have?<BR>
 The temple of the body is being plundered by the thieves within, but this faithless cynic does not even recognize these demons. ||7||<BR>
 They are argumentative demons, terrifying goblins.<BR>
 These demons stir up conflict and strife.<BR>
 Without awareness of the Shabad, one comes and goes in reincarnation; he loses his honor in this coming and going. ||8||<BR>
 The body of the false person is just a pile of barren dirt.<BR>
 Without the Name, what honor can you have?<BR>
 Bound and gagged throughout the four ages, there is no liberation; the Messenger of Death keeps such a person under his gaze. ||9||<BR>
 At Death's door, he is tied up and punished;<BR>
 such a sinner does not obtain salvation.<BR>
 He cries out in pain, like the fish pierced by the hook. ||10||<BR>
 The faithless cynic is caught in the noose all alone.<BR>
 The miserable spiritually blind person is caught in the power of Death.<BR>
 Without the Lord's Name, liberation is not known. He shall waste away, today or tomorrow. ||11||<BR>
 Other than the True Guru, no one is your friend.<BR>
 Here and hereafter, God is the Savior.<BR>
 He grants His Grace, and bestows the Lord's Name. He merges with Him, like water with water. ||12||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 044</H2></CENTER>
 The Guru instructs His wandering Sikhs;<BR>
 if they go astray, He sets them on the right path.<BR>
 So serve the Guru, forever, day and night; He is the Destroyer of pain - He is with you as your companion. ||13||<BR>
 O mortal being, what devotional worship have you performed to the Guru?<BR>
 Even Brahma, Indra and Shiva do not know it.<BR>
 Tell me, how can the unknowable True Guru be known? He alone attains this realization, whom the Lord forgives. ||14||<BR>
 One who has love within, obtains the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.<BR>
 One who enshrines love for the Word of the Guru's Bani, meets with Him.<BR>
 Day and night, the Gurmukh sees the immaculate Divine Light everywhere; this lamp illuminates his heart. ||15||<BR>
 The food of spiritual wisdom is the supremely sweet essence.<BR>
 Whoever tastes it, sees the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.<BR>
 Beholding His Darshan, the unattached one meets the Lord; subduing the mind's desires, he merges into the Lord. ||16||<BR>
 Those who serve the True Guru are supreme and famous.<BR>
 Deep within each and every heart, they recognize God.<BR>
 Please bless Nanak with the Lord's Praises, and the Sangat, the Congregation of the Lord's humble servants; through the True Guru, they know their Lord God. ||17||5||11||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 The True Lord is the Creator of the Universe.<BR>
 He established and contemplates the worldly sphere.<BR>
 He Himself created the creation, and beholds it; He is True and independent. ||1||<BR>
 He created the beings of different kinds.<BR>
 The two travellers have set out in two directions.<BR>
 Without the Perfect Guru, no one is liberated. Chanting the True Name, one profits. ||2||<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs read and study, but they do not know the way.<BR>
 They do not understand the Naam, the Name of the Lord; they wander, deluded by doubt.<BR>
 They take bribes, and give false testimony; the noose of evil-mindedness is around their necks. ||3||<BR>
 They read the Simritees, the Shaastras and the Puraanas;<BR>
 they argue and debate, but do not know the essence of reality.<BR>
 Without the Perfect Guru, the essence of reality is not obtained. The true and pure beings walk the Path of Truth. ||4||<BR>
 All praise God and listen, and listen and speak.<BR>
 He Himself is wise, and He Himself judges the Truth.<BR>
 Those whom God blesses with His Glance of Grace become Gurmukh, and praise the Word of the Shabad. ||5||<BR>
 Many listen and listen, and speak the Guru's Bani.<BR>
 Listening and speaking, no one knows His limits.<BR>
 He alone is wise, unto whom the unseen Lord reveals Himself; he speaks the Unspoken Speech. ||6||<BR>
 At birth, the congratulations pour in;<BR>
 the ignorant sing songs of joy.<BR>
 Whoever is born, is sure to die, according to the destiny of past deeds inscribed upon his head by the Sovereign Lord King. ||7||<BR>
 Union and separation were created by my God.<BR>
 Creating the Universe, He gave it pain and pleasure.<BR>
 The Gurmukhs remain unaffected by pain and pleasure; they wear the armor of humility. ||8||<BR>
 The noble people are traders in Truth.<BR>
 They purchase the true merchandise, contemplating the Guru.<BR>
 One who has the wealth of the true commodity in his lap, is blessed with the rapture of the True Shabad. ||9||<BR>
 The false dealings lead only to loss.<BR>
 The trades of the Gurmukh are pleasing to God.<BR>
 His stock is safe, and his capital is safe and sound. The noose of Death is cut away from around his neck. ||10||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 045</H2></CENTER>
 Everyone speaks as they please.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh, in duality, does not know how to speak.<BR>
 The blind person has a blind and deaf intellect; coming and going in reincarnation, he suffers in pain. ||11||<BR>
 In pain he is born, and in pain he dies.<BR>
 His pain is not relieved, without seeking the Sanctuary of the Guru.<BR>
 In pain he is created, and in pain he perishes. What has he brought with himself? And what will he take away? ||12||<BR>
 True are the actions of those who are under the Guru's influence.<BR>
 They do not come and go in reincarnation, and they are not subject to the laws of Death.<BR>
 Whoever abandons the branches, and clings to the true root, enjoys true ecstasy within his mind. ||13||<BR>
 Death cannot strike down the people of the Lord.<BR>
 They do not see pain on the most difficult path.<BR>
 Deep within the nucleus of their hearts, they worship and adore the Lord's Name; there is nothing else at all for them. ||14||<BR>
 There is no end to the Lord's sermon and Praise.<BR>
 As it pleases You, I remain under Your Will.<BR>
 I am embellished with robes of honor in the Court of the Lord, by the Order of the True King. ||15||<BR>
 How can I chant Your uncounted glories?<BR>
 Even the greatest of the great do not know Your limits.<BR>
 Please bless Nanak with the Truth, and preserve his honor; You are the supreme emperor above the heads of kings. ||16||6||12||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl, Dakhanee:<BR>
 Deep within the body-village is the fortress.<BR>
 The dwelling of the True Lord is within the city of the Tenth Gate.<BR>
 This place is permanent and forever immaculate. He Himself created it. ||1||<BR>
 Within the fortress are balconies and bazaars.<BR>
 He Himself takes care of His merchandise.<BR>
 The hard and heavy doors of the Tenth Gate are closed and locked. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they are thrown open. ||2||<BR>
 Within the fortress is the cave, the home of the self.<BR>
 He established the nine gates of this house, by His Command and His Will.<BR>
 In the Tenth Gate, the Primal Lord, the unknowable and infinite dwells; the unseen Lord reveals Himself. ||3||<BR>
 Within the body of air, water and fire, the One Lord dwells.<BR>
 He Himself stages His wondrous dramas and plays.<BR>
 By His Grace, water puts out the burning fire; He Himself stores it up in the watery ocean. ||4||<BR>
 Creating the earth, He established it as the home of Dharma.<BR>
 Creating and destroying, He remains unattached.<BR>
 He stages the play of the breath everywhere. Withdrawing His power, He lets the beings crumble. ||5||<BR>
 Your gardener is the vast vegetation of nature.<BR>
 The wind blowing around is the chauree, the fly-brush, waving over You.<BR>
 The Lord placed the two lamps, the sun and the moon; the sun merges in the house of the moon. ||6||<BR>
 The five birds do not fly wild.<BR>
 The tree of life is fruitful, bearing the fruit of Ambrosial Nectar.<BR>
 The Gurmukh intuitively sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord; he eats the food of the Lord's sublime essence. ||7||<BR>
 The dazzling light glitters, although neither the moon nor the stars are shining;<BR>
 neither the sun's rays nor the lightning flashes across the sky.<BR>
 I describe the indescribable state, which has no sign, where the all-pervading Lord is still pleasing to the mind. ||8||<BR>
 The rays of Divine Light have spread out their brilliant radiance.<BR>
 Having created the creation, the Merciful Lord Himself gazes upon it.<BR>
 The sweet, melodious, unstruck sound current vibrates continuously in the home of the fearless Lord. ||9||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 046</H2></CENTER>
 When the unstruck sound current resounds, doubt and fear run away.<BR>
 God is all-pervading, giving shade to all.<BR>
 All belong to You; to the Gurmukhs, You are known. Singing Your Praises, they look beautiful in Your Court. ||10||<BR>
 He is the Primal Lord, immaculate and pure.<BR>
 I know of no other at all.<BR>
 The One Universal Creator Lord dwells within, and is pleasing to the mind of those who banishe egotism and pride. ||11||<BR>
 I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar, given by the True Guru.<BR>
 I do not know any other second or third.<BR>
 He is the One, Unique, Infinite and Endless Lord; He evaluates all beings and places some in His treasury. ||12||<BR>
 Spiritual wisdom and meditation on the True Lord are deep and profound.<BR>
 No one knows Your expanse.<BR>
 All that are, beg from You; You are attained only by Your Grace. ||13||<BR>
 You hold karma and Dharma in Your hands, O True Lord.<BR>
 O Independent Lord, Your treasures are inexhaustible.<BR>
 You are forever kind and compassionate, God. You unite in Your Union. ||14||<BR>
 You Yourself see, and cause Yourself to be seen.<BR>
 You Yourself establish, and You Yourself disestablish.<BR>
 The Creator Himself unites and separates; He Himself kills and rejuvenates. ||15||<BR>
 As much as there is, is contained within You.<BR>
 You gaze upon Your creation, sitting within Your royal palace.<BR>
 Nanak offers this true prayer; gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, I have found peace. ||16||1||13||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 If I am pleasing to You, Lord, then I obtain the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.<BR>
 In loving devotional worship, O True Lord, I sing Your Glorious Praises.<BR>
 By Your Will, O Creator Lord, You have become pleasing to me, and so sweet to my tongue. ||1||<BR>
 The devotees look beautiful in the Darbaar, the Court of God.<BR>
 Your slaves, Lord, are liberated.<BR>
 Eradicating self-conceit, they are attuned to Your Love; night and day, they meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Shiva, Brahma, gods and goddesses,<BR>
 Indra, ascetics and silent sages serve You.<BR>
 Celibates, givers of charity and the many forest-dwellers have not found the Lord's limits. ||3||<BR>
 No one knows You, unless You let them know You.<BR>
 Whatever is done, is by Your Will.<BR>
 You created the 8.4 million species of beings; by Your Will, they draw their breath. ||4||<BR>
 Whatever is pleasing to Your Will, undoubtedly comes to pass.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh shows off, and comes to grief.<BR>
 Forgetting the Name, he finds no place of rest; coming and going in reincarnation, he suffers in pain. ||5||<BR>
 Pure is the body, and immaculate is the swan-soul;<BR>
 within it is the immaculate essence of the Naam.<BR>
 Such a being drinks in all his pains like Ambrosial Nectar; he never suffers sorrow again. ||6||<BR>
 For his excessive indulgences, he receives only pain;<BR>
 from his enjoyments, he contracts diseases, and in the end, he wastes away.<BR>
 His pleasure can never erase his pain; without accepting the Lord's Will, he wanders lost and confused. ||7||<BR>
 Without spiritual wisdom, they all just wander around.<BR>
 The True Lord is pervading and permeating everywhere, lovingly engaged.<BR>
 The Fearless Lord is known through the Shabad, the Word of the True Guru; one's light merges into the Light. ||8||<BR>
 He is the eternal, unchanging, immeasurable Lord.<BR>
 In an instant, He destroys, ang then reconstructs.<BR>
 He has no form or shape, no limit or value. Pierced by the Shabad, one is satisfied. ||9||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 047</H2></CENTER>
 I am the slave of Your slaves, O my Beloved.<BR>
 The seekers of Truth and goodness contemplate You.<BR>
 Whoever believes in the Name, wins; He Himself implants Truth within. ||10||<BR>
 The Truest of the True has the Truth is His lap.<BR>
 The True Lord is pleased with those who love the Shabad.<BR>
 Exerting His power, the Lord has established Truth throughout the three worlds; with Truth He is pleased. ||11||<BR>
 Everyone calls Him the greatest of the great.<BR>
 Without the Guru, no one understands Him.<BR>
 The True Lord is pleased with those who merge in Truth; they are not separated again, and they do not suffer. ||12||<BR>
 Separated from the Primal Lord, they loudly weep and wail.<BR>
 They die and die, only to be reborn, when their time has passed.<BR>
 He blesses those whom He forgives with glorious greatness; united with Him, they do not regret or repent. ||13 |<BR>
 | He Himself is the Creator, and He Himself is the Enjoyer.<BR>
 He Himself is satisfied, and He Himself is liberated.<BR>
 The Lord of liberation Himself grants liberation; He eradicates possessiveness and attachment. ||14||<BR>
 I consider Your gifts to be the most wonderful gifts.<BR>
 You are the Cause of causes, Almighty Infinite Lord.<BR>
 Creating the creation, You gaze upon what You have created; You cause all to do their deeds. ||15||<BR>
 They alone sing Your Glorious Praises, who are pleasing to You, O True Lord.<BR>
 They issue forth from You, and merge again into You.<BR>
 Nanak offers this true prayer; meeting with the True Lord, peace is obtained. ||16||2||14||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 For endless eons, there was only utter darkness.<BR>
 There was no earth or sky; there was only the infinite Command of His Hukam.<BR>
 There was no day or night, no moon or sun; God sat in primal, profound Samaadhi. ||1||<BR>
 There were no sources of creation or powers of speech, no air or water.<BR>
 There was no creation or destruction, no coming or going.<BR>
 There were no continents, nether regions, seven seas, rivers or flowing water. ||2||<BR>
 There were no heavenly realms, earth or nether regions of the underworld.<BR>
 There was no heaven or hell, no death or time.<BR>
 There was no hell or heaven, no birth or death, no coming or going in reincarnation. ||3||<BR>
 There was no Brahma, Vishnu or Shiva.<BR>
 No one was seen, except the One Lord.<BR>
 There was no female or male, no social class or caste of birth; no one experienced pain or pleasure. ||4||<BR>
 There were no people of celibacy or charity; no one lived in the forests.<BR>
 There were no Siddhas or seekers, no one living in peace.<BR>
 There were no Yogis, no wandering pilgrims, no religious robes; no one called himself the master. ||5||<BR>
 There was no chanting or meditation, no self-discipline, fasting or worship.<BR>
 No one spoke or talked in duality.<BR>
 He created Himself, and rejoiced; He evaluates Himself. ||6||<BR>
 There was no purification, no self-restraint, no malas of basil seeds.<BR>
 There were no Gopis, no Krishna, no cows or cowherds.<BR>
 There were no tantras, no mantras and no hypocrisy; no one played the flute. ||7||<BR>
 There was no karma, no Dharma, no buzzing fly of Maya.<BR>
 Social class and birth were not seen with any eyes.<BR>
 There was no noose of attachment, no death inscribed upon the forehead; no one meditated on anything. ||8||<BR>
 There was no slander, no seed, no soul and no life.<BR>
 There was no Gorakh and no Maachhindra.<BR>
 There was no spiritual wisdom or meditation, no ancestry or creation, no reckoning of accounts. ||9||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 048</H2></CENTER>
 There were no castes or social classes, no religious robes, no Brahmin or Kh'shaatriya.<BR>
 There were no demi-gods or temples, no cows or Gaayatri prayer.<BR>
 There were no burnt offerings, no ceremonial feasts, no cleansing rituals at sacred shrines of pilgrimage; no one worshipped in adoration. ||10||<BR>
 There was no Mullah, there was no Qazi.<BR>
 There was no Shaykh, or pilgrims to Mecca.<BR>
 There was no king or subjects, and no worldly egotism; no one spoke of himself. ||11||<BR>
 There was no love or devotion, no Shiva or Shakti - no energy or matter.<BR>
 There were no friends or companions, no semen or blood.<BR>
 He Himself is the banker, and He Himself is the merchant. Such is the Pleasure of the Will of the True Lord. ||12||<BR>
 There were no Vedas, Korans or Bibles, no Simritees or Shaastras.<BR>
 There was no recitation of the Puraanas, no sunrise or sunset.<BR>
 The Unfathomable Lord Himself was the speaker and the preacher; the unseen Lord Himself saw everything. ||13||<BR>
 When He so willed, He created the world.<BR>
 Without any supporting power, He sustained the universe.<BR>
 He created Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva; He fostered enticement and attachment to Maya. ||14||<BR>
 How rare is that person who listens to the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 He created the creation, and watches over it; the Hukam of His Command is over all.<BR>
 He formed the planets, solar systems and nether regions, and brought what was hidden to manifestation. ||15||<BR>
 No one knows His limits.<BR>
 This understanding comes from the Perfect Guru.<BR>
 O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Truth are wonderstruck; singing His Glorious Praises, they are filled with wonder. ||16||3||15||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 He Himself created the creation, remaining unattached.<BR>
 The Merciful Lord has established His True Home.<BR>
 Binding together air, water and fire, He created the fortress of the body. ||1||<BR>
 The Creator established the nine gates.<BR>
 In the Tenth Gate, is the dwelling of the infinite, unseen Lord.<BR>
 The seven seas are overflowing with the Ambrosial Water; the Gurmukhs are not stained with filth. ||2||<BR>
 The lamps of the sun and the moon fill all with light.<BR>
 Creating them, He beholds His own glorious greatness.<BR>
 The Giver of peace is forever the embodiment of Light; from the True Lord, glory is obtained. ||3||<BR>
 Within the fortress are the stores and markets; the business is transacted there.<BR>
 The Supreme Merchant weighs with the perfect weights.<BR>
 He Himself buys the jewel, and He Himself appraises its value. ||4||<BR>
 The Appraiser appraises its value.<BR>
 The Independent Lord is overflowing with His treasures.<BR>
 He holds all powers, He is all-pervading; how few are those who, as Gurmukh, understand this. ||5||<BR>
 When He bestows His Glance of Grace, one meets the Perfect Guru.<BR>
 The tyrannical Messenger of Death cannot strike him then.<BR>
 He blossoms forth like the lotus flower in the water; he blossoms forth in joyful meditation. ||6||<BR>
 He Himself rains down the Ambrosial Stream of jewels, diamonds, and rubies of priceless value.<BR>
 When they meet the True Guru, then they find the Perfect Lord; they obtain the treasure of Love. ||7||<BR>
 Whoever receives the priceless treasure of Love<BR>
 - his weight never decreases; he has perfect weight.<BR>
 The trader of Truth becomes true, and obtains the merchandise. ||8||<BR>
 How rare are those who obtain the true merchandise.<BR>
 Meeting the Perfect True Guru, one meets with the Lord.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 049</H2></CENTER>
 One who becomes Gurmukh realizes the Hukam of His command; surrendering to His Command, one merges in the Lord. ||9||<BR>
 By His Command we come, and by His command we merge into Him again.<BR>
 By His Command, the world was formed.<BR>
 By His Command, the heavens, this world and the nether regions were created; by His Command, His Power supports them. ||10||<BR>
 The Hukam of His Command is the mythical bull which supports the burden of the earth on its head.<BR>
 By His Hukam, air, water and fire came into being.<BR>
 By His Hukam, one dwells in the house of matter and energy - Shiva and Shakti. By His Hukam, He plays His plays. ||11||<BR>
 By the Hukam of His command, the sky is spread above.<BR>
 By His Hukam, His creatures dwell in the water, on the land and throughout the three worlds.<BR>
 By His Hukam, we draw our breath and receive our food; by His Hukam, He watches over us, and inspires us to see. ||12||<BR>
 By His Hukam, He created His ten incarnations,<BR>
 and the uncounted and infinite gods and devils.<BR>
 Whoever obeys the Hukam of His Command, is robed with honor in the Court of the Lord; united with the Truth, He merges in the Lord. ||13||<BR>
 By the Hukam of His Command, the thirty-six ages passed.<BR>
 By His Hukam, the Siddhas and seekers contemplate Him.<BR>
 The Lord Himself has brought all under His control. Whoever He forgives, is liberated. ||14||<BR>
 In the strong fortress of the body with its beautiful doors, is the king, with his special assistants and ministers.<BR>
 Those gripped by falsehood and greed do not dwell in the celestial home; engrossed in greed and sin, they come to regret and repent. ||15||<BR>
 Truth and contentment govern this body-village.<BR>
 Chastity, truth and self-control are in the Sanctuary of the Lord.<BR>
 O Nanak, one intuitively meets the Lord, the Life of the World; the Word of the Guru's Shabad brings honor. ||16||4||16||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 In the Primal Void, the Infinite Lord assumed His Power.<BR>
 He Himself is unattached, infinite and incomparable.<BR>
 He Himself exercised His Creative Power, and He gazes upon His creation; from the Primal Void, He formed the Void. ||1||<BR>
 From this Primal Void, He fashioned air and water.<BR>
 He created the universe, and the king in the fortress of the body.<BR>
 Your Light pervades fire, water and souls; Your Power rests in the Primal Void. ||2||<BR>
 From this Primal Void, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva issued forth.<BR>
 This Primal Void is pervasive throughout all the ages.<BR>
 That humble being who contemplates this state is perfect; meeting with him, doubt is dispelled. ||3||<BR>
 From this Primal Void, the seven seas were established.<BR>
 The One who created them, Himself contemplates them.<BR>
 That human being who becomes Gurmukh, who bathes in the pool of Truth, is not cast into the womb of reincarnation again. ||4||<BR>
 From this Primal Void, came the moon, the sun and the earth.<BR>
 His Light pervades all the three worlds.<BR>
 The Lord of this Primal Void is unseen, infinite and immaculate; He is absorbed in the Primal Trance of Deep Meditation. ||5||<BR>
 From this Primal Void, the earth and the Akaashic Ethers were created.<BR>
 He supports them without any visible support, by exercising His True Power.<BR>
 He fashioned the three worlds, and the rope of Maya; He Himself creates and destroys. ||6||<BR>
 From this Primal Void, came the four sources of creation, and the power of speech.<BR>
 They were created from the Void, and they will merge into the Void.<BR>
 The Supreme Creator created the play of Nature; through the Word of His Shabad, He stages His Wondrous Show. ||7||<BR>
 From this Primal Void, He made both night and day;<BR>
 creation and destruction, pleasure and pain.<BR>
 The Gurmukh is immortal, untouched by pleasure and pain. He obtains the home of his own inner being. ||8||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 050</H2></CENTER>
 The Saam Veda, the Rig Veda, the Jujar Veda and the At'harva Veda<BR>
 form the mouth of Brahma; they speak of the three gunas, the three qualities of Maya.<BR>
 None of them can describe His worth. We speak as He inspires us to speak. ||9||<BR>
 From the Primal Void, He created the seven nether regions.<BR>
 From the Primal Void, He established this world to lovingly dwell upon Him.<BR>
 The Infinite Lord Himself created the creation. Everyone acts as You make them act, Lord. ||10||<BR>
 Your Power is diffused through the three gunas: raajas, taamas and satva.<BR>
 Through egotism, they suffer the pains of birth and death.<BR>
 Those blessed by His Grace become Gurmukh; they attain the fourth state, and are liberated. ||11||<BR>
 From the Primal Void, the ten incarnations welled up.<BR>
 Creating the Universe, He made the expanse.<BR>
 He fashioned the demi-gods and demons, the heavenly heralds and celestial musicians; everyone acts according to their past karma. ||12||<BR>
 The Gurmukh understands, and does not suffer the disease.<BR>
 How rare are those who understand this ladder of the Guru.<BR>
 Throughout the ages, they are dedicated to liberation, and so they become liberated; thus they are honored. ||13||<BR>
 From the Primal Void, the five elements became manifest.<BR>
 They joined to form the body, which engages in actions.<BR>
 Both bad and good are written on the forehead, the seeds of vice and virtue. ||14||<BR>
 The True Guru, the Primal Being, is sublime and detached.<BR>
 Attuned to the Word of the Shabad, He is intoxicated with the sublime essence of the Lord.<BR>
 Riches, intellect, miraculous spiritual powers and spiritual wisdom are obtained from the Guru; through perfect destiny, they are received. ||15||<BR>
 This mind is so in love with Maya.<BR>
 Only a few are spiritually wise enough to understand and know this.<BR>
 In hope and desire, egotism and skepticism, the greedy man acts falsely. ||16||<BR>
 From the True Guru, contemplative meditation is obtained.<BR>
 And then, one dwells with the True Lord in His celestial home, the Primal State of Absorption in Deepest Samaadhi.<BR>
 O Nanak, the immaculate sound current of the Naad, and the Music of the Shabad resound; one merges into the True Name of the Lord. ||17||5||17||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 Wherever I look, I see the Lord, merciful to the meek.<BR>
 God is compassionate; He does not come or go in reincarnation.<BR>
 He pervades all beings in His mysterious way; the Sovereign Lord remains detached. ||1||<BR>
 The world is a reflection of Him; He has no father or mother.<BR>
 He has not acquired any sister or brother.<BR>
 There is no creation or destruction for Him; He has no ancestry or social status. The Ageless Lord is pleasing to my mind. ||2||<BR>
 You are the Deathless Primal Being. Death does not hover over Your head.<BR>
 You are the unseen inaccessible and detached Primal Lord.<BR>
 You are true and content; the Word of Your Shabad is cool and soothing. Through it, we are lovingly, intuitively attuned to You. ||3||<BR>
 The three qualities are pervasive; the Lord dwells in His home, the fourth state.<BR>
 He has made death and birth into a bite of food.<BR>
 The immaculate Light is the Life of the whole world. The Guru reveals the unstruck melody of the Shabad. ||4||<BR>
 Sublime and good are those humble Saints, the Beloveds of the Lord.<BR>
 They are intoxicated with the sublime essence of the Lord, and are carried across to the other side.<BR>
 Nanak is the dust of the Society of the Saints; by Guru's Grace, he finds the Lord. ||5||<BR>
 You are the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. All beings belong to You.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 051</H2></CENTER>
 You are the Great Giver; I am Your slave.<BR>
 Please be merciful and bless me with Your Ambrosial Naam, and the jewel, the lamp of the Guru's spiritual wisdom. ||6||<BR>
 From the union of the five elements, this body was made.<BR>
 Finding the Lord, the Supreme Soul, peace is established.<BR>
 The good karma of past actions brings fruitful rewards, and man is blessed with the jewel of the Lord's Name. ||7||<BR>
 His mind does not feel any hunger or thirst.<BR>
 He knows the Immaculate Lord to be everywhere, in each and every heart.<BR>
 Imbued with the Lord's Ambrosial essence, he becomes a pure, detached renunciate; he is lovingly absorbed in the Guru's Teachings. ||8||<BR>
 Whoever does the deeds of the soul, day and night,<BR>
 sees the immaculate Divine Light deep within.<BR>
 Enraptured with the delightful essence of the Shabad, the source of nectar, my tongue plays the sweet music of the flute. ||9||<BR>
 He alone plays the sweet music of this flute,<BR>
 who knows the three worlds.<BR>
 O Nanak, know this, through the Guru's Teachings, and lovingly focus yourself on the Lord's Name. ||10||<BR>
 Rare are those beings in this world,<BR>
 who contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and remain detached.<BR>
 They save themselves, and save all their associates and ancestors; fruitful is their birth and coming into this world. ||11||<BR>
 He alone knows the home of his own heart, and the door to the temple,<BR>
 who obtains perfect understanding from the Guru.<BR>
 In the body-fortress is the palace; God is the True Master of this Palace. The True Lord established His True Throne there. ||12||<BR>
 The fourteen realms and the two lamps are the witnesses.<BR>
 The Lord's servants, the self-elect, do not taste the poison of corruption.<BR>
 Deep within, is the priceless, incomparable commodity; meeting with the Guru, the wealth of the Lord is obtained. ||13||<BR>
 He alone sits on the throne, who is worthy of the throne.<BR>
 Following the Guru's Teachings, he subdues the five demons, and becomes the Lord's foot soldier.<BR>
 He has existed from the very beginning of time and throughout the ages; He exists here and now, and will always exist. Meditating on Him, skepticism and doubt are dispelled. ||14||<BR>
 The Lord of the Throne is greeted and worshipped day and night.<BR>
 This true glorious greatness comes to those who love the Guru's Teachings.<BR>
 O Nanak, meditate on the Lord, and swim across the river; they find the Lord, their best friend, in the end. ||15||1||18||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 Gather in the wealth of the Lord, O humble Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 Serve the True Guru, and remain in His Sanctuary.<BR>
 This wealth cannot be stolen; the celestial melody of the Shabad wells up and keeps us awake and aware. ||1||<BR>
 You are the One Universal Creator, the Immaculate King.<BR>
 You Yourself arrange and resolve the affairs of Your humble servant.<BR>
 You are immortal, immovable, infinite and priceless; O Lord, Your place is beautiful and eternal. ||2||<BR>
 In the body-village, the most sublime place,<BR>
 the supremely noble people dwell.<BR>
 Above them is the Immaculate Lord, the One Universal Creator; they are lovingly absorbed in the profound, primal state of Samaadhi. ||3||<BR>
 There are nine gates to the body-village;<BR>
 the Creator Lord fashioned them for each and every person.<BR>
 Within the Tenth Gate, dwells the Primal Lord, detached and unequalled. The unknowable reveals Himself. ||4||<BR>
 The Primal Lord cannot be held to account; True is His Celestial Court.<BR>
 The Hukam of His Command is in effect; True is His Insignia.<BR>
 O Nanak, search and examine your own home, and you shall find the Supreme Soul, and the Name of the Lord. ||5||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 052</H2></CENTER>
 The Primal Lord is everywhere, immaculate and all-knowing.<BR>
 He administers justice, and is absorbed in the spiritual wisdom of the Guru.<BR>
 He seizes sexual desire and anger by their necks, and kills them; He eradicates egotism and greed. ||6||<BR>
 In the True Place, the Formless Lord abides.<BR>
 Whoever understands his own self, contemplates the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 He comes to abide deep within the True Mansion of His Presence, and his comings and goings are ended. ||7||<BR>
 His mind does not waver, and he is not buffeted by the winds of desire.<BR>
 Such a Yogi vibrates the unstruck sound current of the Shabad.<BR>
 God Himself plays the pure music of the Panch Shabad, the five primal sounds to hear. ||8||<BR>
 In the Fear of God, in detachment, one intuitively merges into the Lord.<BR>
 Renouncing egotism, he is imbued with the unstruck sound current.<BR>
 With the ointment of enlightenment, the Immaculate Lord is known; the Immaculate Lord King is pervading everywhere. ||9||<BR>
 God is eternal and imperishable; He is the Destroyer of pain and fear.<BR>
 He cures the disease, and cuts away the noose of death.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Lord God is the Destroyer of fear; meeting the Guru, the Lord God is found. ||10||<BR>
 One who knows the Immaculate Lord chews up death.<BR>
 One who understands karma, realizes the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 He Himself knows, and He Himself realizes. This whole world is all His play. ||11||<BR>
 He Himself is the Banker, and He Himself is the Merchant.<BR>
 The Appraiser Himself appraises.<BR>
 He Himself tests upon His Touchstone, and He Himself estimates the value. ||12||<BR>
 God Himself, the Merciful Lord, grants His Grace.<BR>
 The Gardener pervades and permeates each and every heart.<BR>
 The pure, primal, detached Lord abides within all. The Guru, the Lord Incarnate, leads us to meet the Lord God. ||13||<BR>
 God is wise and all-knowing; He purges men of their pride.<BR>
 Eradicating duality, the One Lord reveals Himself.<BR>
 Such a being remains unattached amidst hope, singing the Praise of the Immaculate Lord, who has no ancestry. ||14||<BR>
 Eradicating egotism, he obtains the peace of the Shabad.<BR>
 He alone is spiritually wise, who contemplates his own self.<BR>
 O Nanak, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the true profit is obtained; in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, the fruit of Truth is obtained. ||15||2||19||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 Speak the Truth, and remain in the home of Truth.<BR>
 Remain dead while yet alive, and cross over the terrifying world-ocean.<BR>
 The Guru is the boat, the ship, the raft; meditating on the Lord in your mind, you shall be carried across to the other side. ||1||<BR>
 Eliminating egotism, possessiveness and greed,<BR>
 one is liberated from the nine gates, and obtains a place in the Tenth Gate.<BR>
 Lofty and high, the farthest of the far and infinite, He created Himself. ||2||<BR>
 Receiving the Guru's Teachings, and lovingly attuned to the Lord, one crosses over.<BR>
 Singing the Praises of the absolute Lord, why should anyone be afraid of death?<BR>
 Wherever I look, I see only You; I do not sing of any other at all. ||3||<BR>
 True is the Lord's Name, and True is His Sanctuary.<BR>
 True is the Word of the Guru's Shabad, grasping it, one is carries across.<BR>
 Speaking the Unspoken, one sees the Infinite Lord, and then, he does not have to enter the womb of reincarnation again. ||4||<BR>
 Without the Truth, no one finds sincerity or contentment.<BR>
 Without the Guru, no one is liberated; coming and going in reincarnation continue.<BR>
 Chanting the Mool Mantra, and the Name of the Lord, the source of nectar, says Nanak, I have found the Perfect Lord. ||5||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 053</H2></CENTER>
 Without the Truth, the terrifying world-ocean cannot be crossed.<BR>
 This ocean is vast and unfathomable; it is overflowing with the worst poison.<BR>
 One who receives the Guru's Teachings, and remains aloof and detached, obtains a place in the home of the Fearless Lord. ||6||<BR>
 False is the cleverness of loving attachment to the world.<BR>
 In no time at all, it comes and goes.<BR>
 Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the proud egotistical people depart; in creation and destruction they are wasted away. ||7||<BR>
 In creation and destruction, they are bound in bondage.<BR>
 The noose of egotism and Maya is around their necks.<BR>
 Whoever does not accept the Guru's Teachings, and does not dwell upon the Lord's Name, is bound and bagged, and dragged into the City of Death. ||8||<BR>
 Without the Guru, how can anyone be emancipated or liberated?<BR>
 Without the Guru, how can anyone meditate on the Lord's Name?<BR>
 Accepting the Guru's Teachings, cross over the arduous, terrifying world-ocean; you shall be emancipated, and find peace. ||9||<BR>

 The Gurmukh understands, and is pleased with the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 Who does he praise or slander?<BR>
 Know yourself, and meditate on the Lord of the Universe; let your mind be pleased with the Lord, the Master of the Universe. ||13||<BR>
 Know the One who pervades all the realms of the universe.<BR>
 As Gurmukh, understand and realize the Shabad.<BR>
 The Enjoyer enjoys each and every heart, and yet He remains detached from all. ||14||<BR>
 Through the Guru's Teachings, chant the Pure Praises of the Lord.<BR>
 Through the Guru's Teachings, behold the lofty Lord with your eyes.<BR>
 Whoever listens to the Lord's Name, and the Word of His Bani, O Nanak, is imbued with the color of the Lord's Love. ||15||3||20||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 Leave behind sexual desire, anger and the slander of others.<BR>
 Renounce greed and possessiveness, and become carefree.<BR>
 Break the chains of doubt, and remain unattached; you shall find the Lord, and the Lord's sublime essence, deep within yourself. ||1||<BR>
 As one sees the flash of lightning in the night,<BR>
 see the Divine Light deep within your nucleus, day and night.<BR>
 The Lord, the embodiment of bliss, incomparably beautiful, reveals the Perfect Guru. ||2||<BR>
 So meet with the True Guru, and God Himself will save you.<BR>
 He placed the lamps of the sun and the moon in the home of the sky.<BR>
 See the invisible Lord, and remain absorbed in loving devotion. God is all throughout the three worlds. ||3||<BR>
 Obtaining the sublime ambrosial essence, desire and fear are dispelled.<BR>
 The state of inspired illumination is obtained, and self-conceit is eradicated.<BR>
 The lofty and exalted state, the highest of the high is obtained, practicing the immaculate Word of the Shabad. ||4||<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the invisible and unfathomable Lord, is infinite.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 054</H2></CENTER>
 The sublime essence of the Beloved Naam is utterly sweet.<BR>
 O Lord, please bless Nanak with Your Praise in each and every age; meditating on the Lord, I cannot find His limits. ||5||<BR>
 With the Naam deep within the nucleus of the self, the jewel is obtained.<BR>
 Meditating on the Lord, the mind is comforted and consoled by the mind itself.<BR>
 On that most difficult path, the Destroyer of fear is found, and one does not have to enter the womb of reincarnation again. ||6||<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, inspiration for loving devotional worship wells up.<BR>
 I beg for the treasure of the Naam, and the Lord's Praise.<BR>
 When it pleases the Lord, He unites me in Union with the Guru; the Lord saves the whole world. ||7||<BR>
 One who chants the Lord's Chant, attains the Wisdom of the True Guru.<BR>
 The tyrant, the Messenger of Death, becomes a servant at his feet.<BR>
 In the noble congregation of the Sangat, one's state and way of life become noble as well, and one crosses over the terrifying world-ocean. ||8||<BR>
 Through the Shabad, one crosses over this terrifying world-ocean.<BR>
 The duality within is burnt away from within.<BR>
 Taking up the five arrows of virtue, Death is killed, drawing the Bow of the Tenth Gate in the Mind's Sky. ||9||<BR>
 How can the faithless cynics attain enlightened awareness of the Shabad?<BR>
 Without awareness of the Shabad, they come and go in reincarnation.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh obtains the support of liberation; by perfect destiny, he meets the Lord. ||10||<BR>
 The Fearless True Guru is our Savior and Protector.<BR>
 Devotional worship is obtained through the Guru, the Lord of the world.<BR>
 The blissful music of the unstruck sound current vibrates and resounds; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Immaculate Lord is obtained. ||11||<BR>
 He alone is fearless, who has no destiny written on His head.<BR>
 God Himself is unseen; He reveals Himself through His wondrous creative power.<BR>
 He Himself is unattached, unborn and self-existent. O Nanak, through the Guru's Teachings, He is found. ||12||<BR>
 The True Guru knows the state of one's inner being.<BR>
 He alone is fearless, who realizes the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 He looks within his own inner being, and realizes the Lord within all; his mind does not waver at all. ||13||<BR>
 He alone is fearless, within whose being the Lord abides.<BR>
 Day and night, he is delighted with the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 O Nanak, in the Sangat, the Holy Congregation, the Lord's Praise is obtained, and one easily, intuitively meets the Lord. ||14||<BR>
 One who knows God, within the self and beyond,<BR>
 remains detached, and brings his wandering mind back to its home.<BR>
 The True Primal Lord is over all the three worlds; O Nanak, His Ambrosial Nectar is obtained. ||15||4||21||<BR>
 Maaroo, First Mehl:<BR>
 The Creator Lord is infinite; His creative power is wondrous.<BR>
 Created beings have no power over Him.<BR>
 He formed the living beings, and He Himself sustains them; the Hukam of His Command controls each and every one. ||1||<BR>
 The all-pervading Lord orchestrates all through His Hukam.<BR>
 Who is near, and who is far away?<BR>
 Behold the Lord, both hidden and manifest, in each and every heart; the unique Lord is permeating all. ||2||<BR>

 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, meditate on the Lord's Name.<BR>
 God is the embodiment of bliss, incomparably beautiful and unfathomable; meeting with the Guru, doubt is dispelled. ||3||<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is more dear to me than my mind, body and wealth.<BR>
 In the end, when I must depart, it shall be my only help and support.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 055</H2></CENTER>
 In this world of love and attachment, no one is anyone else's friend or companion; without the Lord, without the Guru, who has ever found peace? ||4||<BR>
 He, unto whom the Perfect Guru grants His Grace,<BR>
 is merged in the Word of the Shabad, through the Teachings of the brave, heroic Guru.<BR>
 O Nanak, dwell upon, and serve at the Guru's feet; He places those who wander back on the Path. ||5||<BR>
 The wealth of the Lord's Praise is very dear to the humble Saints.<BR>
 Through the Guru's Teachings, I have obtained Your Name, Lord.<BR>
 The beggar serves at the Lord's door, and in the Court of the Lord, sings His Praises. ||6||<BR>
 When one meets the True Guru, he is called into the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.<BR>
 In the True Court, he is blessed with salvation and honor.<BR>
 The faithless cynic has no place of rest in the Lord's palace; he suffers the pains of birth and death. ||7||<BR>
 So serve the True Guru, the unfathomable ocean,<BR>
 and you shall obtain the profit, the wealth, the jewel of the Naam.<BR>
 The filth of corruption is washed away, by bathing in the pool of Ambrosial Nectar. In the Guru's pool, contentment is obtained. ||8||<BR>
 So serve the Guru without hesitation.<BR>
 And in the midst of hope, remain unmoved by hope.<BR>
 Serve the Eradicator of cynicism and suffering, and you shall never again be afflicted by the disease. ||9||<BR>
 One who is pleasing to the True Lord is blessed with glorious greatness.<BR>
 Who else can teach him anything?<BR>
 The Lord and the Guru are pervading in one form. O Nanak, the Lord loves the Guru. ||10||<BR>
 Some read scriptures, the Vedas and the Puraanas.<BR>
 Some sit and listen, and read to others.<BR>
 Tell me, how can the heavy, rigid doors be opened? Without the True Guru, the essence of reality is not realized. ||11||<BR>
 Some collect dust, and smear their bodies with ashes;<BR>
 but deep within them are the outcasts of anger and egotism.<BR>
 Practicing hypocrisy, Yoga is not obtained; without the True Guru, the unseen Lord is not found. ||12||<BR>
 Some make vows to visit sacred shrines of pilgrimage, keep fasts and live in the forest.<BR>
 Some practice chastity, charity and self-discipline, and speak of spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 But without the Lord's Name, how can anyone find peace? Without the True Guru, doubt is not dispelled. ||13||<BR>
 Inner cleansing techniques, channeling the energy to raise the Kundalini to the Tenth Gate,<BR>
 inhaling, exhaling and holding the breath by the force of the mind -<BR>
 by empty hypocritical practices, Dharmic love for the Lord is not produced. Only through the Word of the Guru's Shabad is the sublime, supreme essence obtained. ||14||<BR>
 Seeing the Lord's creative power, my mind remains satisfied.<BR>
 Through the Guru's Shabad, I have realized that all is God.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Lord, the Supreme Soul, is in all. The Guru, the True Guru, has inspired me to see the unseen Lord. ||15||5||22||<BR>
 Maaroo, Solhay, Third Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 By the Hukam of His Command, He effortlessly created the Universe.<BR>
 Creating the creation, He gazes upon His own greatness.<BR>
 He Himself acts, and inspires all to act; in His Will, He pervades and permeates all. ||1||<BR>
 The world is in the darkness of love and attachment to Maya.<BR>
 How rare is that Gurmukh who contemplates, and understands.<BR>
 He alone attains the Lord, unto whom He grants His Grace. He Himself unites in His Union. ||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 056</H2></CENTER>
 Uniting with Himself, He bestows glorious greatness.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, one comes to know the Lord's worth.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh wanders everywhere, weeping and wailing; he is utterly ruined by the love of duality. ||3||<BR>
 Egotism was instilled into the illusion of Maya.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh is deluded, and loses his honor.<BR>
 But one who becomes Gurmukh is absorbed in the Name; he remains immersed in the True Lord. ||4||<BR>
 Spiritual wisdom is obtained from the Guru, along with the jewel of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Desires are subdued, and one remains immersed in the mind.<BR>
 The Creator Himself stages all His plays; He Himself bestows understanding. ||5||<BR>
 One who serves the True Guru eradicates self-conceit.<BR>
 Meeting with his Beloved, he finds peace through the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 Deep within his inner being, he is imbued with loving devotion; intuitively, he becomes one with the Lord. ||6||<BR>
 The Destroyer of pain is known through the Guru.<BR>
 The Great Giver, the Life of the world, Himself has met me.<BR>
 He alone understands, whom the Lord joins with Himself. Fear and doubt are taken away from his body. ||7||<BR>
 He Himself is the Gurmukh, and He Himself bestows His blessings.<BR>
 Through the True Word of the Shabad, serve the True Guru.<BR>
 Old age and death cannot even touch one who is in harmony with the True Lord. ||8||<BR>
 The world is burning up in the fire of desire.<BR>
 It burns and burns, and is destroyed in all its corruption.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh finds no place of rest anywhere. The True Guru has imparted this understanding. ||9||<BR>
 Those who serve the True Guru are very fortunate.<BR>
 They remain lovingly focused on the True Name forever.<BR>
 The Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord, permeates the nucleus of their inner being; through the Shabad, their desires are quenched. ||10||<BR>
 True is the Word of the Shabad, and True is the Bani of His Word.<BR>
 How rare is that Gurmukh who realizes this.<BR>
 Those who are imbued with the True Shabad are detached. Their comings and goings in reincarnation are ended. ||11||<BR>
 One who realizes the Shabad is cleansed of impurities.<BR>
 The Immaculate Naam abides within his mind.<BR>
 He serves his True Guru forever, and egotism is eradicated from within. ||12||<BR>
 If one comes to understand, through the Guru, then he comes to know the Lord's Door.<BR>
 But without the Naam, one babbles and argues in vain.<BR>
 The glory of serving the True Guru is that it eradicates hunger and thirst. ||13||<BR>
 When the Lord unites them with Himself, then they come to understand.<BR>
 Without spiritual wisdom, they understand nothing at all.<BR>
 One whose mind is filled with the Guru's gift forever - his inner being resounds with the Shabad, and the Word of the Guru's Bani. ||14||<BR>
 He acts according to his pre-ordained destiny.<BR>
 No one can erase the Command of the Primal Lord.<BR>
 They alone dwell in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, who have such pre-ordained destiny. ||15||<BR>
 He alone finds the Lord, unto whom He grants His Grace.<BR>
 He links his consciousness to the deep meditative state of the True Shabad.<BR>
 Nanak, Your slave, offers this humble prayer; I stand at Your Door, begging for Your Name. ||16||1||<BR>
 Maaroo, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The One and only Lord is pervading and permeating everywhere.<BR>
 How rare is that person, who as Gurmukh, understands this.<BR>
 The One Lord is permeating and pervading, deep within the nucleus of all. Without Him, there is no other at all. ||1||<BR>
 He created the 8.4 millions species of beings.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 057</H2></CENTER>
 The spiritual teachers and meditators proclaim this.<BR>
 He Himself nourishes all; no one else can estimate His value. ||2||<BR>
 Love and attachment to Maya are utter darkness.<BR>
 Egotism and possessiveness have spread throughout the expanse of the universe.<BR>
 Night and day, they burn, day and night; without the Guru, there is no peace or tranquility. ||3||<BR>
 He Himself unites, and He Himself separates.<BR>
 He Himself establishes, and He Himself disestablishes.<BR>
 True is the Hukam of His Command, and True is the expanse of His universe. No one else can issue any Command. ||4||<BR>
 He alone is attached to the Lord, whom the Lord attaches to Himself.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, the fear of death runs away.<BR>
 The Shabad, the Giver of peace, dwells forever deep within the nucleus of the self. One who is Gurmukh understands. ||5||<BR>
 God Himself unites those united in His Union.<BR>
 Whatever is pre-ordained by destiny, cannot be erased.<BR>
 Night and day, His devotees worship Him, day and night; one who becomes Gurmukh serves Him. ||6||<BR>
 Serving the True Guru, lasting peace is experienced.<BR>
 He Himself, the Giver of all, has come and met me.<BR>
 Subduing egotism, the fire of thirst has been extinguished; contemplating the Word of the Shabad, peace is found. ||7||<BR>
 One who is attached to his body and family, does not understand.<BR>
 But one who becomes Gurmukh, sees the Lord with his eyes.<BR>
 Night and day, he chants the Naam, day and night; meeting with his Beloved, he finds peace. ||8||<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh wanders distracted, attached to duality.<BR>
 That unfortunate wretch - why didn't he just die as soon as he was born?<BR>
 Coming and going, he wastes away his life in vain. Without the Guru, liberation is not obtained. ||9||<BR>
 That body which is stained with the filth of egotism is false and impure.<BR>
 It may be washed a hundred times, but its filth is still not removed.<BR>
 But if it is washed with the Word of the Shabad, then it is truly cleansed, and it shall never be soiled again. ||10||<BR>
 The five demons destroy the body.<BR>
 He dies and dies again, only to be reincarnated; he does not contemplate the Shabad.<BR>
 The darkness of emotional attachment to Maya is within his inner being; as if in a dream, he does not understand. ||11||<BR>
 Some conquer the five demons, by being attached to the Shabad.<BR>
 They are blessed and very fortunate; the True Guru comes to meet them.<BR>
 Within the nucleus of their inner being, they dwell upon the Truth; attuned to the Lord's Love, they intuitively merge in Him. ||12||<BR>
 The Guru's Way is known through the Guru.<BR>
 His perfect servant attains realization through the Shabad.<BR>
 Deep within his heart, he dwells forever upon the Shabad; he tastes the sublime essence of the True Lord with his tongue. ||13||<BR>
 Egotism is conquered and subdued by the Shabad.<BR>
 I have enshrined the Name of the Lord within my heart.<BR>
 Other than the One Lord, I know nothing at all. Whatever will be, will automatically be. ||14||<BR>
 Without the True Guru, no one obtains intuitive wisdom.<BR>
 The Gurmukh understands, and is immersed in the True Lord.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 058</H2></CENTER>
 There is only One Command, and there is only One Supreme King. In each and every age, He links each to their tasks. ||1||<BR>
 That humble being is immaculate, who knows his own self.<BR>
 The Lord, the Giver of peace, Himself comes and meets him.<BR>
 His tongue is imbued with the Shabad, and he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord; he is honored in the Court of the True Lord. ||2||<BR>
 The Gurmukh is blessed with the glorious greatness of the Naam.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh, the slanderer, loses his honor.<BR>
 Attuned to the Naam, the supreme soul-swans remain detached; in the home of the self, they remain absorbed in deep meditative trance. ||3||<BR>
 That humble being who dies in the Shabad is perfect.<BR>
 The brave, heroic True Guru chants and proclaims this.<BR>
 Deep within the body is the true pool of Ambrosial Nectar; the mind drinks it in with loving devotion. ||4||<BR>
 The Pandit, the religious scholar, reads and instructs others,<BR>
 but he does not realize that his own home is on fire.<BR>
 Without serving the True Guru, the Naam is not obtained. You can read until you are exhausted, but you shall not find peace and tranquility. ||5||<BR>
 Some smear their bodies with ashes, and wander around in religious disguises.<BR>
 Without the Word of the Shabad, who has ever subdued egotism?<BR>
 Night and day, they continue burning, day and night; they are deluded and confused by their doubt and religious costumes. ||6||<BR>
 Some, in the midst of their household and family, remain always unattached.<BR>
 They die in the Shabad, and dwell in the Lord's Name.<BR>
 Night and day, they remain forever attuned to His Love; they focus their consciousness on loving devotion and the Fear of God. ||7||<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh indulges in slander, and is ruined.<BR>
 The dog of greed barks within him.<BR>
 The Messenger of Death never leaves him, and in the end, he leaves, regretting and repenting. ||8||<BR>
 Through the True Word of the Shabad, true honor is obtained.<BR>
 Without the Name, no one attains liberation.<BR>
 Without the True Guru, no one finds the Name. Such is the making which God has made. ||9||<BR>
 Some are Siddhas and seekers, and great contemplators.<BR>
 Some remain imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Formless Lord, day and night.<BR>
 He alone understands, whom the Lord unites with Himself; through loving devotional worship, fear is dispelled. ||10||<BR>
 Some take cleansing baths and give donations to charities, but they do not understand.<BR>

 Through perfect destiny, one realizes the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 Those who are immersed in the Shabad are not separated again. By His Grace, they are intuitively immersed in the Lord. ||14||<BR>
 Acting in egotism, they are stained with the filth of Maya.<BR>
 They die and die again, only to be reborn in the love of duality.<BR>
 Without serving the True Guru, no one finds liberation. O mind, tune into this, and see. ||15||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 059</H2></CENTER>
 He does whatever He pleases.<BR>
 No one has done, or can do anything by himself.<BR>
 O Nanak, through the Name, one is blessed with glorious greatness, and obtains honor in the Court of the True Lord. ||16||3||<BR>
 Maaroo, Third Mehl:<BR>
 All who come shall have to depart.<BR>
 In the love of duality, they are caught by the noose of the Messenger of Death.<BR>
 Those humble beings who are protected by the True Guru, are saved. They merge into the Truest of the True. ||1||<BR>
 The Creator Himself creates the creation, and watches over it.<BR>
 Thay alone are acceptable, upon whom He bestows His Glance of Grace.<BR>
 The Gurmukh attains spiritual wisdom, and understands everything. The ignorant ones act blindly. ||2||<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh is cynical; he doesn't understand.<BR>

 But meeting with the Perfect Guru, it is transmuted into gold once again.<BR>
 When the Lord Himself grants forgiveness, then peace is obtained; through the Perfect Word of the Shabad, one is united with Him. ||4||<BR>
 The false and evil-minded are the most wicked of the wicked.<BR>
 They are the most unworthy of the unworthy.<BR>
 With false intellect, and insipid words of mouth, evil-minded, they do not obtain the Naam. ||5||<BR>
 The unworthy soul-bride is not pleasing to her Husband Lord.<BR>
 False-minded, her actions are false.<BR>
 The foolish person does not know the excellence of her Husband Lord. Without the Guru, she does not understand at all. ||6||<BR>
 The evil-minded, wicked soul-bride practices wickedness.<BR>
 She decorates herself, but her Husband Lord is not pleased.<BR>
 The virtuous soul-bride enjoys and ravishes her Husband Lord forever; the True Guru unites her in His Union. ||7||<BR>
 God Himself issues the Hukam of His Command, and beholds all.<BR>
 Some are forgiven, according to their pre-ordained destiny.<BR>
 Night and day, they are imbued with the Naam, and they find the True Lord. He Himself unites them in His Union. ||8||<BR>
 Egotism attaches them to the juice of emotional attachment, and makes them run around.<BR>
 The Gurmukh is intuitively immersed in the True Love of the Lord.<BR>
 He Himself unites, He Himself acts, and beholds. Without the True Guru, understanding is not obtained. ||9||<BR>
 Some contemplate the Word of the Shabad; these humble beings remain always awake and aware.<BR>
 Some are attached to the love of Maya; these unfortunate ones remain asleep.<BR>
 He Himself acts, and inspires all to act; no one else can do anything. ||10||<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, death is conquered and killed.<BR>
 Keep the Name of the Lord enshrined within your heart.<BR>
 Serving the True Guru, peace is obtained, and one merges in the Name of the Lord. ||11||<BR>
 In the love of duality, the world wanders around insane.<BR>
 Immersed in love and attachment to Maya, it suffers in pain.<BR>
 Wearing all sorts of religious robes, He is not obtained. Without the True Guru, peace is not found. ||12||<BR>
 Who is to blame, when He Himself does everything?<BR>
 As He wills, so is the path we take.<BR>
 He Himself is the Merciful Giver of peace; as He wills, so do we follow. ||13||<BR>
 He Himself is the Creator, and He Himself is the Enjoyer.<BR>
 He Himself is detached, and He Himself is attached.<BR>
 He Himself is immaculate, compassionate, the lover of nectar; the Hukam of His Command cannot be erased. ||14||<BR>
 Those who know the One Lord are very fortunate.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 060</H2></CENTER>
 He dwells in each and every heart, the Great Giver, the Life of the world.<BR>
 At the same time, He is both hidden and revealed. For the Gurmukh, doubt and fear are dispelled. ||15||<BR>
 The Gurmukh knows the One, the Dear Lord.<BR>
 Deep within the nucleus of his inner being, is the Naam, the Name of the Lord; he realizes the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 He alone receives it, unto whom You give it. O Nanak, the Naam is glorious greatness. ||16||4||<BR>
 Maaroo, Third Mehl:<BR>
 I praise the true, profound and unfathomable Lord.<BR>
 All the world is in His power.<BR>
 He enjoys all hearts forever, day and night; He Himself dwells in peace. ||1||<BR>
 True is the Lord and Master, and True is His Name.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, I enshrine Him in my mind.<BR>
 He Himself has come to dwell deep within the nucleus of my heart; the noose of death has been snapped. ||2||<BR>
 Whom should I serve, and whom should I praise?<BR>
 I serve the True Guru, and praise the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 Through the True Shabad, the intellect is exalted and ennobled forever, and the lotus deep within blossoms forth. ||3||<BR>
 The body is frail and perishable, like paper.<BR>
 When the drop of water falls upon it, it crumbles and dissolves instantaneously.<BR>
 But the body of the Gurmukh, who understands, is like gold; the Naam, the Name of the Lord, dwells deep within. ||4||<BR>
 Pure is that kitchen, which is enclosed by spiritual awareness.<BR>
 The Lord's Name is my food, and Truth is my support.<BR>
 Forever satisfied, sanctified and pure is that person, within whose heart the Lord's Name abides. ||5||<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to those who are attached to the Truth.<BR>
 They sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and remain awake and aware night and day.<BR>
 True peace fills them forever, and their tongues savor the sublime essence of the Lord. ||6||<BR>
 I remember the Lord's Name, and no other at all.<BR>
 I serve the One Lord, and no other at all.<BR>
 The Perfect Guru has revealed the whole Truth to me; I dwell in the True Name. ||7||<BR>
 Wandering, wandering in reincarnation, again and again, he comes into the world.<BR>
 He is deluded and confused, when the Lord and Master confuses him.<BR>
 He meets with the Dear Lord, when, as Gurmukh, he understands; he remembers the Shabad, the Word of the immortal, eternal Lord God. ||8||<BR>
 I am a sinner, overflowing with sexual desire and anger.<BR>
 With what mouth should I speak? I have no virtue, and I have rendered no service.<BR>
 I am a sinking stone; please, Lord, unite me with Yourself. Your Name is eternal and imperishable. ||9||<BR>
 No one does anything; no one is able to do anything.<BR>
 That alone happens, which the Lord Himself does, and causes to be done.<BR>
 Those whom He Himself forgives, find peace; they dwell forever in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||10||<BR>
 This body is the earth, and the infinite Shabad is the seed.<BR>
 Deal and trade with the True Name alone.<BR>
 The True wealth increases; it is never exhausted, when the Naam dwells deep within. ||11||<BR>
 O Dear Lord, please bless me, the worthless sinner, with virtue.<BR>
 Forgive me, and bless me with Your Name.<BR>
 One who becomes Gurmukh, is honored; he dwells in the Name of the One Lord alone. ||12||<BR>
 The wealth of the Lord is deep within one's inner being, but he does not realize it.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, one comes to understand.<BR>
 One who becomes Gurmukh is blessed with this wealth; he lives forever in the Naam. ||13||<BR>
 Fire and wind lead him into delusions of doubt.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 061</H2></CENTER>
 In love and attachment to Maya, he has no understanding at all.<BR>
 The blind, self-willed manmukh sees nothing; through the Guru's Teachings, the Naam is gloriously revealed. ||14||<BR>
 The manmukhs are asleep in egotism and Maya.<BR>
 They do not watch over their own homes, and are ruined in the end.<BR>
 They slander others, and burn in great anxiety; they dwell in pain and suffering. ||15||<BR>
 The Creator Himself has created the creation.<BR>
 He blesses the Gurmukh with understanding.<BR>
 O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam - their minds become immaculate; they dwell in the Naam, and only the Naam. ||16||5||<BR>
 Maaroo, Third Mehl:<BR>
 I serve the One Lord, who is eternal, stable and True.<BR>
 Attached to duality, the whole world is false.<BR>
 Following the Guru's Teachings, I praise the True Lord forever, pleased with the Truest of the True. ||1||<BR>
 Your Glorious Virtues are so many, Lord; I do not know even one.<BR>
 The Life of the world, the Great Giver, attaches us to himself.<BR>
 He Himself forgives, and bestows glorious greatness. Following the Guru's Teachings, this mind is delighted. ||2||<BR>
 The Word of the Shabad has subdued the waves of Maya.<BR>
 Egotism has been conquered, and this mind has become immaculate.<BR>
 I intuitively sing His Glorious Praises, imbued with the Lord's Love. My tongue chants and savors the Lord's Name. ||3||<BR>
 Crying out, "Mine, mine!" he spends his life.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh does not understand; he wanders around in ignorance.<BR>
 The Messenger of Death watches over him every moment, every instant; night and day, his life is wasting away. ||4||<BR>
 He practices greed within, and does not understand.<BR>
 He does not see the Messenger of Death hovering over his head.<BR>
 Whatever one does in this world, will come to face him in the hereafter; what can he do at that very last moment? ||5||<BR>
 Those who are attached to the Truth are true.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs, attached to duality, weep and wail.<BR>
 He is the Lord and Master of both worlds; He Himself delights in virtue. ||6||<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, His humble servant is exalted forever.<BR>
 This mind is enticed by the Naam, the source of nectar.<BR>
 It is not stained at all by the dirt of attachment to Maya; through the Guru's Teachings, it is pleased and saturated with the Lord's Name. ||7||<BR>

 Deep within are peace and tranquility, and lasting peace is obtained. Following the Guru's Teachings, one is blessed with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||10||<BR>
 Even Indra, seated upon his throne, is caught in the fear of death.<BR>
 The Messenger of Death will not spare them, even though they try all sorts of things.<BR>
 When one meets with the True Guru, one is liberated, drinking in and savoring the sublime essence of the Lord, Har, Har. ||11||<BR>
 There is no devotion within the self-willed manmukh.<BR>
 Through devotional worship, the Gurmukh obtains peace and tranquility.<BR>
 Forever pure and sanctified is the Word of the Guru's Bani; following the Guru's Teachings, one's inner being is drenched in it. ||12||<BR>
 I have considered Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.<BR>
 They are bound by the three qualities - the three gunas; they are far away from liberation.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 062</H2></CENTER>
 The Gurmukh knows the spiritual wisdom of the One Lord. Night and day, he chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||13||<BR>
 He may read the Vedas, but he does not realize the Lord's Name.<BR>
 For the sake of Maya, he reads and recites and argues.<BR>
 The ignorant and blind person is filled with filth within. How can he cross over the impassable world-ocean? ||14||<BR>
 He voices all the controversies of the Vedas,<BR>
 but his inner being is not saturated or satisfied, and he does not realize the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 The Vedas tell all about virtue and vice, but only the Gurmukh drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||15||<BR>
 The One True Lord is all by Himself.<BR>
 There is no one else except Him.<BR>
 O Nanak, true is the mind of one who is attuned to the Naam; he speaks Truth, and nothing but Truth. ||16||6||<BR>

 He dwells in His own home deep within the self, where there is no emotional attachment to Maya.<BR>

 True is his merchandise, and true is his trade.<BR>
 There is no doubt within him, and no expanse of duality.<BR>
 He has earned the true wealth, which is never exhausted. How few are those who contemplate this, and understand. ||2||<BR>
 They alone are attached to the True Name, whom the Lord Himself attaches.<BR>

 Without the Guru, they do not understand pain and pleasure; attached to Maya, they suffer in terrible pain. ||9||<BR>
 Those whose minds are pleased with the True Word of the Shabad<BR>
 act according to pre-ordained destiny.<BR>
 They serve the True Lord, and meditate on the True Lord; they are imbued with contemplative meditation on the True Lord. ||10||<BR>

 The stubborn and insensitive mind is attached to the love of duality.<BR>
 Deluded by doubt, the unfortunate wander around in confusion.<BR>
 But if they are blessed by God's Grace, they serve the True Guru, and easily obtain peace. ||10||<BR>

 Only in this human life, is devotional worship to the Guru implanted within.<BR>
 Without devotion, one lives in manure; he falls into manure again and again. ||11||<BR>
 If one is blessed with His Grace, devotional worship to the Guru is implanted within.<BR>

 My Tenth Gate has been opened and revealed.<BR>
 The unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates and resounds there, with the melody of the Guru's Bani; one is easily, intuitively absorbed in the Lord. ||6||<BR>
 Those who are so pre-ordained by the Creator,<BR>
 pass their nights and days calling on the Guru.<BR>
 Without the True Guru, no one understands; focus your consciousness on the Guru's Feet. ||7||<BR>
 The Lord Himself blesses those with whom He is pleased.<BR>
 The Gurmukh receives the wealth of the Naam.<BR>
 When the Lord grants His Grace, He bestows the Naam; Nanak is immersed and absorbed in the Naam. ||8||<BR>
 The jewel of spiritual wisdom is revealed within the mind.<BR>
 The wealth of the Naam is easily, intuitively received.<BR>
 This glorious greatness is obtained from the Guru; I am forever a sacrifice to the True Guru. ||9||<BR>
 With the rising of the sun, the darkness of the night is dispelled.<BR>
 Spiritual ignorance is eradicated, by the priceless jewel of the Guru.<BR>
 The True Guru is the fantastically valuable jewel of spiritual wisdom; blessed by God's Mercy, peace is found. ||10||<BR>
 The Gurmukh obtains the Naam, and his good reputation increases.<BR>
 In all four ages he is considered to be pure and good.<BR>
 Imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he finds peace. He remains lovingly focused on the Naam. ||11||<BR>
 The Gurmukh receives the Naam.<BR>
 In intuitive peace he wakes, and in intuitive peace he sleeps.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 082</H2></CENTER>
 The Gurmukh is immersed and absorbed in the Naam; Nanak meditates on the Naam. ||12||<BR>
 The Ambrosial Nectar of the Guru's Bani is in the mouth of the devotees.<BR>
 The Gurmukhs chant and repeat the Lord's Name.<BR>
 Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, their minds forever blossom forth; they focus their minds on the Lord's Feet. ||13||<BR>
 I am foolish and ignorant; I have no wisdom at all.<BR>
 From the True Guru, I have obtained understanding in my mind.<BR>
 O Dear Lord, please be kind to me, and grant Your Grace; let me be committed to serving the True Guru. ||14||<BR>
 Those who know the True Guru realize the One Lord.<BR>
 The Giver of peace is all-pervading, permeating everywhere.<BR>
 Understanding my own soul, I have obtained the Supreme Status; my awareness is immersed in selfless service. ||15||<BR>
 Those who are blessed with glorious greatness by the Primal Lord God<BR>
 are lovingly focused on the True Guru, who dwells within their minds.<BR>
 The Giver of life to the world Himself meets them; O Nanak, they are absorbed in His Being. ||16||1||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 The Lord is inaccessible and unfathomable; He is eternal and imperishable.<BR>
 He dwells in the heart, and is all-pervading, permeating everywhere.<BR>
 There is no other Giver except Him; worship the Lord, O mortals. ||1||<BR>
 No one can kill anyone who is saved by the Savior Lord.<BR>
 So serve such a Lord, O Saints, whose Bani is exalted and sublime. ||2||<BR>
 When it seems that a place is empty and void,<BR>
 there, the Creator Lord is permeating and pervading.<BR>
 He causes the dried-up branch to blossom forth in greenery again; so meditate on the Lord - wondrous are His ways! ||3||<BR>
 The One who knows the anguish of all beings<BR>
 - unto that Lord and Master, I am a sacrifice.<BR>
 Offer your prayers to the One who is the Giver of all peace and joy. ||4||<BR>
 But one who does not know the state of the soul<BR>
 - do not say anything to such an ignorant person.<BR>
 Do not argue with fools, O mortals. Meditate on the Lord, in the state of Nirvaanaa. ||5||<BR>
 Don't worry - let the Creator take care of it.<BR>
 The Lord gives to all creatures in the water and on the land.<BR>
 My God bestows His blessings without being asked, even to worms in soil and stones. ||6||<BR>
 Do not place your hopes in friends, children and siblings.<BR>
 Do not place your hopes in kings or the business of others.<BR>
 Without the Lord's Name, no one will be your helper; so meditate on the Lord, the Lord of the world. ||7||<BR>
 Night and day, chant the Naam.<BR>
 All your hopes and desires shall be fulfilled.<BR>
 O servant Nanak, chant the Naam, the Name of the Destroyer of fear, and your life-night shall pass in intuitive peace and poise. ||8||<BR>
 Those who serve the Lord find peace.<BR>
 They are intuitively absorbed in the Lord's Name.<BR>
 The Lord preserves the honor of those who seek His Sanctuary; go and consult the Vedas and the Puraanas. ||9||<BR>
 That humble being is attached to the Lord's service, whom the Lord so attaches.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, doubt and fear are dispelled.<BR>
 In his own home, he remains unattached, like the lotus flower in the water. ||10||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 083</H2></CENTER>
 One who serves in egotism is not accepted or approved.<BR>
 Such a person is born, only to die again, and come and go in reincarnation.<BR>
 Perfect is that penance and that service, which is pleasing to the Mind of my Lord. ||11||<BR>
 What Glorious Virtues of Yours should I chant, O my Lord and Master?<BR>
 You are the Inner-knower, the Searcher of all souls.<BR>
 I beg for blessings from You, O Creator Lord; I repeat Your Name night and day. ||12||<BR>
 Some speak in egotistical power.<BR>
 Some have the power of authority and Maya.<BR>
 I have no other Support at all, except the Lord. O Creator Lord, please save me, meek and dishonored. ||13||<BR>
 You bless the meek and dishonored with honor, as it pleases You, O Lord.<BR>
 Many others argue in conflict, coming and going in reincarnation.<BR>
 Those people, whose side You take, O Lord and Master, are elevated and successful. ||14||<BR>
 Those who meditate forever on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,<BR>
 by Guru's Grace, obtain the supreme status.<BR>
 Those who serve the Lord find peace; without serving Him, they regret and repent. ||15||<BR>
 You are pervading all, O Lord of the world.<BR>
 He alone meditates on the Lord, upon whose forehead the Guru places His hand.<BR>
 Entering the Sanctuary of the Lord, I meditate on the Lord; servant Nanak is the slave of His slaves. ||16||2||<BR>
 Maaroo, Solahas, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 He infused His power into the earth.<BR>
 He suspends the heavens upon the feet of His Command.<BR>
 He created fire and locked it into wood. That God protects all, O Siblings of Destiny. ||1||<BR>
 He gives nourishment to all beings and creatures.<BR>
 He Himself is the all-powerful Creator, the Cause of causes.<BR>
 In an instant, He establishes and disestablishes; He is your help and support. ||2||<BR>
 He cherished you in your mother's womb.<BR>
 With every breath and morsel of food, He is with you, and takes care of you.<BR>
 Forever and ever, meditate on that Beloved; Great is His glorious greatness! ||3||<BR>
 The sultans and nobles are reduced to dust in an instant.<BR>
 God cherishes the poor, and makes them into rulers.<BR>
 He is the Destroyer of egotistical pride, the Support of all. His value cannot be estimated. ||4||<BR>
 He alone is honorable, and he alone is wealthy,<BR>
 within whose mind the Lord God abides.<BR>
 He alone is my mother, father, child, relative and sibling, who created this Universe. ||5||<BR>
 I have come to God's Sanctuary, and so I fear nothing.<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I am sure to be saved.<BR>
 One who adores the Creator in thought, word and deed, shall never be punished. ||6||<BR>
 One whose mind and body are permeated with the Lord, the treasure of virtue,<BR>
 does not wander in birth, death and reincarnation.<BR>
 Pain vanishes and peace prevails, when one is satisfied and fulfilled. ||7||<BR>
 My Lord and Master is my best friend.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 084</H2></CENTER>
 The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, is in all places and interspaces.<BR>
 Meditating, meditating in remembrance on the Perfect Transcendent Lord, I am rid of all anxieties and calculations. ||8||<BR>
 One who has the Name of the Lord has hundreds of thousands and millions of arms.<BR>
 The wealth of the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises is with him.<BR>
 In His Mercy, God has blessed me with the sword of spiritual wisdom; I have attacked and killed the demons. ||9||<BR>
 Chant the Chant of the Lord, the Chant of Chants.<BR>
 Be a winner of the game of life and come to abide in your true home.<BR>
 You shall not see the 8.4 million types of hell; sing His Glorious Praises and remain saturated with loving devotion||10||<BR>
 He is the Savior of worlds and galaxies.<BR>
 He is lofty, unfathomable, inaccessible and infinite.<BR>
 That humble being, unto whom God grants His Grace, meditates on Him. ||11||<BR>
 God has broken my bonds, and claimed me as His own.<BR>
 In His Mercy, He has made me the slave of His home.<BR>
 The unstruck celestial sound current resounds and vibrates, when one performs acts of true service. ||12||<BR>
 O God, I have enshrined faith in You within my mind.<BR>
 My egotistical intellect has been driven out.<BR>
 God has made me His own, and now I have a glorious reputation in this world. ||13||<BR>
 Proclaim His Glorious Victory, and meditate on the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to my Lord God.<BR>
 I do not see any other except Him. The One Lord pervades the whole world. ||14||<BR>
 True, True, True is God.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, my mind is attuned to Him forever.<BR>
 Your humble servants live by meditating, meditating in remembrance on You, merging in You, O One Universal Creator. ||15||<BR>
 The Dear Lord is the Beloved of His humble devotees.<BR>
 My Lord and Master is the Savior of all.<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, all desires are fulfilled. He has saved the honor of servant Nanak. ||16||1||<BR>
 Maaroo, Solahas, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The body-bride is attached to the Yogi, the husband-soul.<BR>
 She is involved with him, enjoying pleasure and delights.<BR>
 As a consequence of past actions, they have come together, enjoying pleasurable play. ||1||<BR>
 Whatever the husband does, the bride willingly accepts.<BR>
 The husband adorns his bride, and keeps her with himself.<BR>
 Joining together, they live in harmony day and night; the husband comforts his wife. ||2||<BR>
 When the bride asks, the husband runs around in all sorts of ways.<BR>
 Whatever he finds, he brings to show his bride.<BR>
 But there is one thing he cannot reach, and so his bride remains hungry and thirsty. ||3||<BR>
 With her palms pressed together, the bride offers her prayer,<BR>
 "O my beloved, do not leave me and go to foreign lands; please stay here with me.<BR>
 Do such business within our home, that my hunger and thirst may be relieved."||4||<BR>
 All sorts of religious rituals are performed in this age,<BR>
 but without the sublime essence of the Lord, not an iota of peace is found.<BR>
 When the Lord becomes Merciful, O Nanak, then in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, the bride and the husband enjoy ecstasy and bliss. ||5||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 085</H2></CENTER>
 The body-bride is blind, and the groom is clever and wise.<BR>
 The creation was created of the five elements.<BR>
 That merchandise, for which you have come into the world, is received only from the True Guru. ||6||<BR>
 The body-bride says, "Please live with me,<BR>
 O my beloved, peaceful, young lord.<BR>
 Without you, I am of no account. Please give me your word, that you will not leave me". ||7||<BR>
 The soul-husband says, "I am the slave of my Commander.<BR>
 He is my Great Lord and Master, who is fearless and independent.<BR>
 As long as He wills, I will remain with you. When He summons me, I shall arise and depart."||8||<BR>
 The husband speaks words of Truth to the bride,<BR>
 but the bride is restless and inexperienced, and she does not understand anything.<BR>
 Again and again, she begs her husband to stay; she thinks that he is just joking when he answers her. ||9||<BR>
 The Order comes, and the husband-soul is called.<BR>
 He does not consult with his bride, and does not ask her opinion.<BR>
 He gets up and marches off, and the discarded body-bride mingles with dust. O Nanak, behold the illusion of emotional attachment and hope. ||10||<BR>
 O greedy mind - listen, O my mind!<BR>
 Serve the True Guru day and night forever.<BR>
 Without the True Guru, the faithless cynics rot away and die. The noose of Death is around the necks of those who have no guru. ||11||<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh comes, and the self-willed manmukh goes.<BR>
 The manmukh suffers beatings again and again.<BR>
 The manmukh endures as many hells as there are; the Gurmukh is not even touched by them. ||12||<BR>
 He alone is Gurmukh, who is pleasing to the Dear Lord.<BR>
 Who can destroy anyone who is robed in honor by the Lord?<BR>
 The blissful one is forever in bliss; he is dressed in robes of honor. ||13||<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to the Perfect True Guru.<BR>
 He is the Giver of Sanctuary, the Heroic Warrior who keeps His Word.<BR>
 Such is the Lord God, the Giver of peace, whom I have met; He shall never leave me or go anywhere else. ||14||<BR>
 He is the treasure of virtue; His value cannot be estimated.<BR>
 He is perfectly permeating each and every heart, prevailing everywhere.<BR>
 Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Destroyer of the pains of the poor; I am the dust of the feet of Your slaves. ||15||1||2||<BR>
 Maaroo, Solahas, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 My Blissful Lord is forever in bliss.<BR>
 He fills each and every heart, and judges each and everyone.<BR>
 The True Lord and Master is above the heads of all kings; there is none other than Him. ||1||<BR>
 He is joyful, blissful and merciful.<BR>
 God's Light is manifest everywhere.<BR>
 He creates forms, and gazing upon them, He enjoys them; He Himself worships Himself. ||2||<BR>
 He contemplates His own creative power.<BR>
 The True Lord Himself creates the expanse of the Universe.<BR>
 He Himself stages the play, day and night; He Himself listens, and hearing, rejoices. ||3||<BR>
 True is His throne, and True is His kingdom.<BR>
 True is the treasure of the True Banker.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 086</H2></CENTER>
 He Himself is True, and true is all that He has established. True is the prevailing Order of the True Lord. ||4||<BR>
 True is the justice of the True Lord.<BR>
 Your place is forever True, O God.<BR>
 True is Your Creative Power, and True is the Word of Your Bani. True is the peace which You give, O my Lord and Master. ||5||<BR>
 You alone are the greatest king.<BR>
 By the Hukam of Your Command, O True Lord, our affairs are fulfilled.<BR>
 Inwardly and outwardly, You know everything; You Yourself are pleased with Yourself. ||6||<BR>
 You are the great party-goer, You are the great enjoyer.<BR>
 You are detached in Nirvaanaa, You are the Yogi.<BR>
 All celestial comforts are in Your home; Your Glance of Grace rains Nectar. ||7||<BR>
 You alone give Your gifts.<BR>
 You grant Your gifts unto all the beings of the world.<BR>
 Your treasures are overflowing, and are never exhausted; through them, we remain satisfied and fulfilled. ||8||<BR>
 The Siddhas, seekers and forest-dwellers beg from You.<BR>
 The celibates and abstainers, and those who abide in peace beg from You.<BR>
 You alone are the Great Giver; all are beggars of You. You bless all the world with Your gifts. ||9||<BR>
 Your devotees worship You with infinite love.<BR>
 In an instant, You establish and disestablish.<BR>
 Your weight is so heavy, O my infinite Lord and Master. Your devotees surrender to the Hukam of Your Command. ||10||<BR>
 They alone know You, whom You bless with Your Glance of Grace.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they enjoy Your Love forever.<BR>
 They alone are clever, handsome and wise, who are pleasing to Your Mind. ||11||<BR>
 One who keeps You in his consciousness, becomes carefree and independent.<BR>
 One who keeps You in his consciousness, is the true king.<BR>
 One who keeps You in his consciousness - what does he have to fear? And what else does he need to do? ||12||<BR>
 Thirst and desire are quenched, and one's inner being is cooled and soothed.<BR>
 The True Guru has mended the broken one.<BR>
 Awareness of the Word of the Shabad has awakened within my heart. Shaking it and vibrating it, I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||13||<BR>
 I shall not die; I shall live forever and ever.<BR>
 I have become immortal; I am eternal and imperishable.<BR>
 I do not come, and I do not go. The Guru has driven out my doubts. ||14||<BR>
 Perfect is the Word of the Perfect Guru.<BR>
 One who is attached to the Perfect Lord, is immersed in the Perfect Lord.<BR>
 His love increases day by day, and when it is weighed, it does not decrease. ||15||<BR>
 When the gold is made one hundred percent pure,<BR>
 its color is true to the jeweller's eye.<BR>
 Assaying it, it is placed in the treasury by God the Jeweller, and it is not melted down again. ||16||<BR>
 Your Naam is Ambrosial Nectar, O my Lord and Master.<BR>
 Nanak, Your slave, is forever a sacrifice to You.<BR>
 In the Society of the Saints, I have found great peace; gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, this mind is pleased and satisfied. ||17||1||3||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl, Solhas:<BR>

 The Guru is the Shaastras, the Simritees and the six rituals. The Guru is the Holy Shrine. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 087</H2></CENTER>
 Meditating in remembrance on the Guru, all the sins are erased.<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance on the Guru, one is not strangled by the noose of Death.<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance on the Guru, the mind becomes immaculate; the Guru eliminates egotistical pride. ||2||<BR>
 The Guru's servant is not consigned to hell.<BR>
 The Guru's servant meditates on the Supreme Lord God.<BR>
 The Guru's servant joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; the Guru ever gives the life of the soul. ||3||<BR>
 At the Gurdwara, the Guru's Gate, the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises are sung.<BR>
 Meeting with the True Guru, one chants the Lord's Praises.<BR>
 The True Guru eradicates sorrow and suffering, and bestows honor in the Court of the Lord. ||4||<BR>
 The Guru has revealed the inaccessible and unfathomable Lord.<BR>
 The True Guru returns to the Path, those who have wandered away.<BR>
 No obstacles stand in the way of devotion to the Lord, for one who serves the Guru. The Guru implants perfect spiritual wisdom. ||5||<BR>
 The Guru has revealed the Lord everywhere.<BR>
 The Lord of the Universe is permeating and pervading the water and the land.<BR>
 The high and the low are all the same to Him. Focus your mind's meditation intuitively on Him. ||6||<BR>
 Meeting with the Guru, all thirst is quenched.<BR>
 Meeting with the Guru, one is not watched by Maya.<BR>
 The Perfect Guru bestows truth and contentment; I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||7||<BR>
 The Word of the Guru's Bani is contained in all.<BR>
 He Himself hears it, and He Himself repeats it.<BR>
 Those who meditate on it, are all emancipated; they attain the eternal and unchanging home. ||8||<BR>
 The Glory of the True Guru is known only to the True Guru.<BR>
 Whatever He does, is according to the Pleasure of His Will.<BR>
 Your humble servants beg for the dust of the feet of the Holy; Nanak is forever a sacrifice to You. ||9||1||4||<BR>
 Maaroo, Solahas, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The Primal, Immaculate Lord God is formless.<BR>
 The Detached Lord is Himself prevailing in all.<BR>
 He has no race or social class, no identifying mark. By the Hukam of His Will, He created the entire universe. ||1||<BR>
 Out of all the 8.4 million species of beings,<BR>
 God blessed mankind with glory.<BR>
 That human who misses this chance, shall suffer the pains of coming and going in reincarnation. ||2||<BR>
 What should I say, to one who has been created.<BR>
 The Gurmukh receives the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 He alone is confused, whom the Lord Himself confuses. He alone understands, whom the Lord inspires to understand. ||3||<BR>
 This body has been made the village of joy and sorrow.<BR>
 They alone are emancipated, who seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru.<BR>
 One who remains untouched by the three qualities, the three gunas - such a Gurmukh is blessed with glory. ||4||<BR>
 You can do anything, but whatever you do, only serves to tie your feet.<BR>
 The seed which is planted out of season does not sprout, and all one's capital and profits are lost. ||5||<BR>
 In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises are most sublime and exalted.<BR>
 Become Gurmukh, chant and focus your meditation.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 088</H2></CENTER>
 You shall save yourself, and save all your generations as well. You shall go to the Court of the Lord with honor. ||6||<BR>
 All the continents, nether worlds, islands and worlds<BR>
 - God Himself has made them all subject to death.<BR>
 The One Imperishable Lord Himself is unmoving and unchanging. Meditating on Him, one becomes unchanging. ||7||<BR>
 The Lord's servant becomes like the Lord.<BR>
 Do not think that, because of his human body, he is different.<BR>
 The waves of the water rise up in various ways, and then the water merges again in water. ||8||<BR>
 A beggar begs for charity at His Door.<BR>
 When God pleases, He takes pity on him.<BR>
 Please bless me with the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, to satisfy my mind, O Lord. Through the Kirtan of Your Praises, my mind is held steady. ||9||<BR>
 The Beauteous Lord and Master is not controlled in any way.<BR>
 The Lord does that which pleases the Saints of the Lord.<BR>
 He does whatever they wish to be done; nothing blocks their way at His Door. ||10||<BR>
 Wherever the mortal is confronted with difficulty,<BR>
 there he should meditate on the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 Where there are no children, spouse or friends, there the Lord Himself comes to the rescue. ||11||<BR>
 The Great Lord and Master is inaccessible and unfathomable.<BR>
 How can anyone meet with God, the self-suficient One?<BR>
 Those who have had the noose cut away from around their necks, whom God has set back upon the Path, obtain a place in the Sangat, the Congregation. ||12||<BR>
 One who realizes the Hukam of the Lord's Command is said to be His servant.<BR>
 He endures both bad and good equally.<BR>
 When egotism is silenced, then one comes to know the One Lord. Such a Gurmukh intuitively merges in the Lord. ||13||<BR>
 The devotees of the Lord dwell forever in peace.<BR>
 With a child-like, innocent nature, they remain detached, turning away from the world.<BR>
 They enjoy various pleasures in many ways; God caresses them, like a father caressing his son. ||14||<BR>
 He is inaccessible and unfathomable; His value cannot be estimated.<BR>
 We meet Him, only when He causes us to meet.<BR>
 The Lord is revealed to those humble Gurmukhs, who have such pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon their foreheads. ||15||<BR>
 You Yourself are the Creator Lord, the Cause of causes.<BR>
 You created the Universe, and You support the whole earth.<BR>
 Servant Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of Your Door, O Lord; if it is Your Will, please preserve his honor. ||16||1||5||<BR>
 Maaroo, Solahas, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Whatever is seen is You, O One Lord.<BR>
 What the ears hear is the Word of Your Bani.<BR>
 There is nothing else to be seen at all. You give support to all. ||1||<BR>
 You Yourself are conscious of Your Creation.<BR>
 You Yourself established Yourself, O God.<BR>
 Creating Yourself, You formed the expanse of the Universe; You Yourself cherish and sustain each and every heart. ||2||<BR>
 You created some to hold great and royal courts.<BR>
 Some turn away from the world in renunciation, and some maintain their households.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 089</H2></CENTER>
 Some are hungry and some are satisfied and satiated, but all lean on Your Support. ||3||<BR>
 The True Lord Himself is True, True, True.<BR>
 He is woven into the essence of His devotees, through and through.<BR>
 He Himself is hidden, and He Himself is revealed. He Himself spreads Himself out. ||4||<BR>
 Forever, forever and ever, He shall always exist.<BR>
 He is lofty, inaccessible, unfathomable and infinite.<BR>
 He fills the empty, and empties out the filled; such are the plays and dramas of my Lord and Master. ||5||<BR>
 With my mouth, I praise my True Lord King.<BR>
 With my eyes, I behold the inaccessible and unfathomable Lord.<BR>
 Listening, listening with my ears, my mind and body are rejuvenated; my Lord and Master saves all. ||6||<BR>
 He created the creation, and gazes upon what He has created.<BR>
 All beings and creatures meditate on Him.<BR>
 He Himself knows His creative power; He blesses with His Glance of Grace. ||7||<BR>
 Where the Saints gather together and sit, God dwells close at hand.<BR>
 They abide in bliss and joy, beholding the Lord's wondrous play.<BR>
 They sing the Glories of the Lord, and the unstruck sound current of His Bani; O Nanak, His slaves remain conscious of Him. ||8||<BR>
 Coming and going is all Your wondrous play.<BR>
 Creating the Creation, You gaze upon Your infinite play.<BR>
 Creating the Creation, You Yourself cherish and nurture it. ||9||<BR>
 Listening, listening to Your Glory, I live.<BR>
 Forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to You.<BR>
 With my palms pressed together, I meditate in remembrance on You, day and night, O my inaccessible, infinite Lord and Master. ||10||<BR>
 Other than You, who else should I praise?<BR>
 I meditate on the One and Only Lord within my mind.<BR>
 Realizing the Hukam of Your Will, Your humble servants are enraptured; this is the achievement of Your devotees. ||11||<BR>
 Following the Guru's Teachings, I meditate on the True Lord within my mind.<BR>
 Following the Guru's Teachings, I am immersed in the Lord's Love.<BR>
 Following the Guru's Teachings, all bonds are broken, and this doubt and emotional attachment are burnt away. ||12||<BR>
 Wherever He keeps me, is my place of rest.<BR>
 Whatever naturally happens, I accept that as good.<BR>
 Hatred is gone - I have no hatred at all; I see the One Lord in all. ||13||<BR>
 Fear has been removed, and darkness has been dispelled.<BR>
 The all-powerful, primal, detached Lord God has been revealed.<BR>
 Forsaking self-conceit, I have entered His Sanctuary, and I work for Him. ||14||<BR>
 Rare are those few, very blessed people, who come into the world,<BR>
 and meditate on their Lord and Master, twenty-four hours a day.<BR>
 Associating with such humble people, all are saved, and their families are saved as well. ||15||<BR>
 This is the blessing which I have received from my Lord and Master.<BR>
 Twenty-four hours a day, with my palms pressed together, I meditate on Him.<BR>
 I chant the Naam, and through the Naam, I intuitively merge into the Lord; O Nanak, may I be blessed with the Naam, and ever repeat it. ||16||1||6||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Do not be fooled by appearances, you fool.<BR>
 This is a false attachment to the expanse of an illusion.<BR>
 No one can remain in this world; only the One Lord is permanent and unchanging. ||1||<BR>
 Seek the Sanctuary of the Perfect Guru.<BR>
 He shall eradicate all emotional attachment, sorrow and doubt.<BR>
 He shall administer the medicine, the Mantra of the One Name. Sing the True Name within your heart. ||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 090</H2></CENTER>
 So many gods yearn for the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 All the devotees serve Him.<BR>
 He is the Master of the masterless, the Destroyer of the pains of the poor. His Name is obtained from the Perfect Guru. ||3||<BR>
 I cannot conceive of any other door.<BR>
 One who wanders through the three worlds, understands nothing.<BR>
 The True Guru is the banker, with the treasure of the Naam. This jewel is obtained from Him. ||4||<BR>
 The dust of His feet purifies.<BR>
 Even the angelic beings and gods cannot obtain it, O friend.<BR>
 The True Guru is the True Primal Being, the Transcendent Lord God; meeting with Him, one is carried across to the other side. ||5||<BR>
 O my beloved mind, if you wish for the 'tree of life';<BR>
 if you wish for Kaamadhayna, the wish-fulfilling cow to adorn your court;<BR>
 if you wish to be satisfied and contented, then serve the Perfect Guru, and practice the Naam, the source of nectar. ||6||<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the five thieves of desire are conquered.<BR>
 In the Fear of the Supreme Lord God, you shall become immaculate and pure.<BR>
 When one meets the Perfect Guru, the Philosopher's Stone, His touch reveals the Lord, the Philosopher's Stone. ||7||<BR>
 Myriads of heavens do not equal the Lord's Name.<BR>
 The spiritually wise forsake mere liberation.<BR>
 The One Universal Creator Lord is found through the True Guru. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan. ||8||<BR>
 No one knows how to serve the Guru.<BR>
 The Guru is the unfathomable, Supreme Lord God.<BR>
 He alone is the Guru's servant, whom the Guru Himself links to His service, and upon whose forehead such blessed destiny is inscribed. ||9||<BR>
 Even the Vedas do not know the Guru's Glory.<BR>
 They narrate only a tiny bit of what is heard.<BR>
 The True Guru is the Supreme Lord God, the Incomparable One; meditating in remembrance on Him, the mind is cooled and soothed. ||10||<BR>
 Hearing of Him, the mind comes to life.<BR>
 When He dwells within the heart, one becomes peaceful and cool.<BR>
 Chanting the Guru's Name with the mouth, one obtains glory, and does not have to walk on the Path of Death. ||11||<BR>
 I have entered the Sanctuary of the Saints,<BR>
 and placed before them my soul, my breath of life and wealth.<BR>
 I know nothing about service and awareness; please take pity upon this worm. ||12||<BR>
 I am unworthy; please merge me into Yourself.<BR>
 Please bless me with Your Grace, and link me to Your service.<BR>
 I wave the fan, and grind the corn for the Saints; washing their feet, I find peace. ||13||<BR>
 After wandering around at so many doors, I have come to Yours, O Lord.<BR>
 By Your Grace, I have entered Your Sanctuary.<BR>
 Forever and ever, keep me in the Company of the Saints; please bless me with this Gift of Your Name. ||14||<BR>
 My World-Lord has become merciful,<BR>
 and I have obtained the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the Perfect True Guru.<BR>
 I have found eternal peace, poise and bliss; Nanak is the slave of Your slaves. ||15||2||7||<BR>

 He, within whose mind God dwells,<BR>
 has perfect karma, and chants the Chant of the Guru.<BR>
 One who realizes God pervading deep within all, does not wander crying in reincarnation again. ||9||<BR>
 Pain, sorrow and doubt run away from that one, within whose mind the Word of the Guru's Shabad abides.<BR>

 The Lord and Master is profoundly deep, unfathomable and unweighable; how can He be measured? ||13||<BR>

 Without You, there is no other at all.<BR>
 You alone, God, are in the beginning, the middle and the end. You are the root of the entire expanse. ||14||<BR>
 The Messenger of Death does not even approach that person<BR>
 who sings the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<BR>
 All desires are fulfilled, for one who listens with his ears to the Praises of God. ||15||<BR>
 You belong to all, and all belong to You, O my true, deep and profound Lord and Master.<BR>

 Says Nanak, those humble beings are exalted, who are pleasing to Your Mind, O my Lord and Master. ||16||1||8||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 God is the almighty Giver of all peace and joy.<BR>
 Be merciful to me, that I may meditate in remembrance on Your Name.<BR>
 The Lord is the Great Giver; all beings and creatures are beggars; His humble servants yearn to beg from Him. ||1||<BR>
 I beg for the dust of the feet of the humble, that I may be blessed with the supreme status,<BR>
 and the filth of countless lifetimes may be erased.<BR>
 The chronic diseases are cured by the medicine of the Lord's Name; I beg to be imbued with the Immaculate Lord. ||2||<BR>
 With my ears, I listen to the Pure Praises of my Lord and Master.<BR>
 With the Support of the One Lord, I have abandoned corruption, sexuality and desire.<BR>
 I humbly bow and fall at the feet of Your slaves; I do not hesitate to do good deeds. ||3||<BR>
 O Lord, with my tongue I sing Your Glorious Praises.<BR>
 The sins which I have committed are erased.<BR>
 Meditating, meditating in remembrance on my Lord and Master, my mind lives; I am rid of the five oppressive demons. ||4||<BR>
 Meditating on Your lotus feet, I have come aboard Your boat.<BR>
 Joining the Society of the Saints, I cross over the world-ocean.<BR>
 My flower-offering and worship is to realize that the Lord is dwelling alike in all; I shall not be reincarnated naked again. ||5||<BR>
 Please make me the slave of Your slaves, O Lord of the world.<BR>
 You are the treasure of Grace, merciful to the meek.<BR>
 Meet with your companion and helper, the Perfect Transcendent Lord God; you shall never be separated from Him again. ||6||<BR>
 I dedicate my mind and body, and place them in offering before the Lord.<BR>
 Asleep for countless lifetimes, I have awakened.<BR>
 He, to whom I belong, is my cherisher and nurturer. I have killed and discarded my murderous self-conceit. ||7||<BR>
 The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, is pervading the water and the land.<BR>
 The undeceivable Lord and Master is permeating each and every heart.<BR>
 The Perfect Guru has demolished the wall of doubt, and now I see the One Lord pervading everywhere. ||8||<BR>
 Wherever I look, there I see God, the ocean of peace.<BR>
 The Lord's treasure is never exhausted; He is the storehouse of jewels.<BR>
 He cannot be seized; He is inaccessible, and His limits cannot be found. He is realized when the Lord bestows His Grace. ||9||<BR>
 My heart is cooled, and my mind and body are calmed and soothed.<BR>
 The craving for birth and death is quenched.<BR>
 Grasping hold of my hand, He has lifted me up and out; He has blessed me with His Ambrosial Glance of Grace. ||10||<BR>
 The One and Only Lord is permeating and pervading everywhere.<BR>

 Whatever I hear, is the Bani of God's Word.<BR>
 Whatever I do, You make me do; You are the Sanctuary, the help and support of the Saints, Your children. ||13||<BR>
 The beggar begs, and worships You in adoration.<BR>
 You are the Purifier of the sinners, O Perfectly Holy Lord God.<BR>
 Please bless me with this one gift, O treasure of all bliss and virtue; I do not ask for anything else. ||14||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 093</H2></CENTER>
 God is the Creator of the body-vessel.<BR>
 In the Society of the Saints, the dye is produced.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Lord's Bani, one's reputation becomes immaculate, and the mind is colored by the dye of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||15||<BR>
 The sixteen powers, absolute perfection and fruitful rewards are obtained,<BR>
 when the Lord and Master of infinite power is revealed.<BR>
 The Lord's Name is Nanak's bliss, play and peace; he drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord. ||16||2||9||<BR>
 Maaroo, Solhas, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 You are my Lord and Master; You have made me Your servant.<BR>
 My soul and body are all gifts from You.<BR>
 You are the Creator, the Cause of causes; nothing belongs to me. ||1||<BR>
 When You sent me, I came into the world.<BR>
 Whatever is pleasing to Your Will, I do.<BR>
 Without You, nothing is done, so I am not anxious at all. ||2||<BR>
 In the world hereafter, the Hukam of Your Command is heard.<BR>
 In this world, I chant Your Praises, Lord.<BR>
 You Yourself write the account, and You Yourself erase it; no one can argue with You. ||3||<BR>
 You are our father; we are all Your children.<BR>
 We play as You cause us to play.<BR>
 The wilderness and the path are all made by You. No one can take the wrong path. ||4||<BR>
 Some remain seated within their homes.<BR>
 Some wander across the country and through foreign lands.<BR>
 Some are grass-cutters, and some are kings. Who among these can be called false? ||5||<BR>
 Who is liberated, and who will land in hell?<BR>
 Who is worldly, and who is a devotee?<BR>
 Who is wise, and who is shallow? Who is aware, and who is ignorant? ||6||<BR>
 By the Hukam of the Lord's Command, one is liberated, and by His Hukam, one falls into hell.<BR>
 By His Hukam, one is worldly, and by His Hukam, one is a devotee.<BR>
 By His Hukam, one is shallow, and by His Hukam, one is wise. There is no other side except His. ||7||<BR>
 You made the ocean vast and huge.<BR>
 You made some into foolish self-willed manmukhs, and dragged them into hell.<BR>
 Some are carried across, in the ship of Truth of the True Guru. ||8||<BR>
 You issue Your Command for this amazing thing, death.<BR>
 You create all beings and creatures, and absorb them back into Yourself.<BR>
 You gaze in delight upon the one arena of the world, and enjoy all the pleasures. ||9||<BR>
 Great is the Lord and Master, and Great is His Name.<BR>
 He is the Great Giver; Great is His place.<BR>
 He is inaccessible and unfathomable, infinite and unweighable. He cannot be measureed. ||10||<BR>
 No one else knows His value.<BR>
 Only You Yourself, O Immaculate Lord, are equal to Yourself.<BR>
 You Yourself are the spiritual teacher, You Yourself are the One who meditates. You Yourself are the great and immense Being of Truth. ||11||<BR>
 For so many days, You remained invisible.<BR>
 For so many days, You were absorbed in silent absorption.<BR>
 For so many days, there was only pitch darkness, and then the Creator revealed Himself. ||12||<BR>
 You Yourself are called the God of Supreme Power.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 094</H2></CENTER>
 You Yourself are the hero, exerting Your regal power.<BR>
 You Yourself spread peace within; You are cool and icy calm. ||13||<BR>
 One whom You bless and make Gurmukh<BR>
 - the Naam abides within him, and the unstruck sound current vibrates for him.<BR>
 He is peaceful, and he is the master of all; the Messenger of Death does not even approach him. ||14||<BR>
 His value cannot be described on paper.<BR>
 Says Nanak, the Lord of the world is infinite.<BR>
 In the beginning, in the middle and in the end, God exists. Judgement is in His Hands alone. ||15||<BR>
 No one is equal to Him.<BR>
 No one can stand up against Him by any means.<BR>
 Nanak's God is Himself all-in-all. He creates and stages and watches His wondrous plays. ||16||1||10||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The Supreme Lord God is imperishable, the Transcendent Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.<BR>

 The Support of the Earth, the man-lion, the Supreme Lord God.<BR>
 The Protector who tears apart demons with His teeth, the Upholder of the earth.<BR>
 O Creator, You assumed the form of the pygmy to humble the demons; You are the Lord God of all. ||3||<BR>
 You are the Great Raam Chand, who has no form or feature.<BR>
 Adorned with flowers, holding the chakra in Your hand, Your form is incomparably beautiful.<BR>
 You have thousands of eyes, and thousands of forms. You alone are the Giver, and all are beggars of You. ||4||<BR>
 You are the Lover of Your devotees, the Master of the masterless.<BR>
 The Lord and Master of the milk-maids, You are the companion of all.<BR>
 O Lord, Immacuate Great Giver, I cannot describe even an iota of Your Glorious Virtues. ||5||<BR>
 Liberator, Enticing Lord, Lord of Lakshmi, Supreme Lord God.<BR>
 Savior of Dropadi's honor.<BR>
 Lord of Maya, miracle-worker, absorbed in delightful play, unattached. ||6||<BR>
 The Blessed Vision of His Darshan is fruitful and rewarding; He is not born, He is self-existent.<BR>
 His form is undying; it is never destroyed.<BR>
 O imperishable, eternal, unfathomable Lord, everything is attached to You. ||7||<BR>
 The Lover of greatness, who dwells in heaven.<BR>
 By the Pleasure of His Will, He took incarnation as the great fish and the tortoise.<BR>
 The Lord of beauteous hair, the Worker of miraculous deeds, whatever He wishes, comes to pass. ||8||<BR>
 He is beyond need of any sustenance, free of hate and all-pervading.<BR>
 He has staged His play; He is called the four-armed Lord.<BR>
 He assumed the beautiful form of the blue-skinned Krishna; hearing His flute, all are fascinated and enticed. ||9||<BR>
 He is adorned with garlands of flowers, with lotus eyes.<BR>
 His ear-rings, crown and flute are so beautiful.<BR>
 He carries the conch, the chakra and the war club; He is the Great Charioteer, who stays with His Saints. ||10||<BR>
 The Lord of yellow robes, the Master of the three worlds.<BR>
 The Lord of the Universe, the Lord of the world; with my mouth, I chant His Name.<BR>
 The Archer who draws the bow, the Beloved Lord God; I cannot count all His limbs. ||11||<BR>
 He is said to be free of anguish, and absolutely immaculate.<BR>
 The Lord of prosperity, pervading the water, the land and the sky.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 095</H2></CENTER>
 He is near this world and the nether regions of the underworld; His Place is permanent, ever-stable and imperishable. ||12||<BR>
 The Purifier of sinners, the Destroyer of pain and fear.<BR>
 The Eliminator of egotism, the Eradicator of coming and going.<BR>
 He is pleased with devotional worship, and merciful to the meek; He cannot be appeased by any other qualities. ||13||<BR>
 The Formless Lord is undeceivable and unchanging.<BR>
 He is the Embodiment of Light; through Him, the whole world blossoms forth.<BR>
 He alone unites with Him, whom He unites with Himself. No one can attain the Lord by himself. ||14||<BR>
 He Himself is the milk-maid, and He Himself is Krishna.<BR>
 He Himself grazes the cows in the forest.<BR>
 You Yourself create, and You Yourself destroy. Not even a particle of filth attaches to You. ||15||<BR>
 Which of Your Glorious Virtues can I chant with my one tongue?<BR>
 Even the thousand-headed serpent does not know Your limit.<BR>
 One may chant new names for You day and night, but even so, O God, no one can describe even one of Your Glorious Virtues. ||16||<BR>
 I have grasped the Support, and entered the Sanctuary of the Lord, the Father of the world.<BR>
 The Messenger of Death is terrifying and horrendous, and sea of Maya is impassable.<BR>
 Please be merciful, Lord, and save me, if it is Your Will; please lead me to join with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||17||<BR>
 All that is seen is an illusion.<BR>
 I beg for this one gift, for the dust of the feet of the Saints, O Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 Applying it to my forehead, I obtain the supreme status; he alone obtains it, unto whom You give it. ||18||<BR>
 Those, unto whom the Lord, the Giver of peace, grants His Mercy,<BR>
 grasp the feet of the Holy, and weave them into their hearts.<BR>
 They obtain all the wealth of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates and resounds within their minds. ||19||<BR>
 With my tongue I chant the Names given to You.<BR>
 'Sat Naam' is Your perfect, primal Name.<BR>
 Says Nanak, Your devotees have entered Your Sanctuary. Please bestow the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; their minds are filled with love for You. ||20||<BR>
 You alone know Your state and extent.<BR>
 You Yourself speak, and You Yourself describe it.<BR>
 Please make Nanak the slave of Your slaves, O Lord; as it pleases Your Will, please keep him with Your slaves. ||21||2||11||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 O slave of the inaccessible Lord God Allah,<BR>
 forsake thoughts of worldly entanglements.<BR>
 Become the dust of the feet of the humble fakeers, and consider yourself a traveller on this journey. O saintly dervish, you shall be approved in the Court of the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Let Truth be your prayer, and faith your prayer-mat.<BR>
 Subdue your desires, and overcome your hopes.<BR>
 Let your body be the mosque, and your mind the priest. Let true purity be God's Word for you. ||2||<BR>
 Let your practice be to live the spiritual life.<BR>
 Let your spiritual cleansing be to renounce the world and seek God.<BR>
 Let control of the mind be your spiritual wisdom, O holy man; meeting with God, you shall never die again. ||3||<BR>
 Practice within your heart the teachings of the Koran and the Bible;<BR>
 restrain the ten sensory organs from straying into evil.<BR>
 Tie up the five demons of desire with faith, charity and contentment, and you shall be acceptable. ||4||<BR>
 Let compassion be your Mecca, and the dust of the feet of the holy your fast.<BR>
 Let Paradise be your practice of the Prophet's Word.<BR>
 God is the beauty, the light and the fragrance. Meditation on Allah is the secluded meditation chamber. ||5||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 096</H2></CENTER>
 He alone is a Qazi, who practices the Truth.<BR>
 He alone is a Haji, a pilgrim to Mecca, who purifies his heart.<BR>
 He alone is a Mullah, who banishes evil; he alone is a saintly dervish, who takes the Support of the Lord's Praise. ||6||<BR>
 Always, at every moment, remember God, the Creator within your heart.<BR>
 Let your meditation beads be the subjugation of the ten senses. Let good conduct and self-restraint be your circumcision. ||7||<BR>
 You must know in your heart that everything is temporary.<BR>
 Family, household and siblings are all entanglements.<BR>
 Kings, rulers and nobles are mortal and transitory; only God's Gate is the permanent place. ||8||<BR>
 First, is the Lord's Praise; second, contentment;<BR>
 third, humility, and fourth, giving to charities.<BR>
 Fifth is to hold one's desires in restraint. These are the five most sublime daily prayers. ||9||<BR>
 Let your daily worship be the knowledge that God is everywhere.<BR>
 Let renunciation of evil actions be the water-jug you carry.<BR>
 Let realization of the One Lord God be your call to prayer; be a good child of God - let this be your trumpet. ||10||<BR>
 Let what is earned righteously be your blessed food.<BR>
 Wash away pollution with the river of your heart.<BR>
 One who realizes the Prophet attains heaven. Azraa-eel, the Messenger of Death, does not cast him into hell. ||11||<BR>
 Let good deeds be your body, and faith your bride.<BR>
 Play and enjoy the Lord's love and delight.<BR>
 Purify what is impure, and let the Lord's Presence be your religious tradition. Let your total awareness be the turban on your head. ||12||<BR>
 To be Muslim is to be kind-hearted,<BR>
 and wash away pollution from within the heart.<BR>
 He does not even approach worldly pleasures; he is pure, like flowers, silk, ghee and the deer-skin. ||13||<BR>
 One who is blessed with the mercy and compassion of the Merciful Lord,<BR>
 is the manliest man among men.<BR>
 He alone is a Shaykh, a preacher, a Haji, and he alone is God's slave, who is blessed with God's Grace. ||14||<BR>
 The Creator Lord has Creative Power; the Merciful Lord has Mercy.<BR>
 The Praises and the Love of the Merciful Lord are unfathomable.<BR>
 Realize the True Hukam, the Command of the Lord, O Nanak; you shall be released from bondage, and carried across. ||15||3||12||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The Abode of the Supreme Lord God is above all.<BR>
 He Himself establishes, establishes and creates.<BR>
 Holding tight to the Sanctuary of God, peace is found, and one is not afflicted by the fear of Maya. ||1||<BR>
 He saved you from the fire of the womb,<BR>
 and did not destroy you, when you were an egg in your mother's ovary.<BR>
 Blessing you with meditative remembrance upon Himself, He nurtured you and cherished you; He is the Master of all hearts. ||2||<BR>
 I have come to the Sanctuary of His lotus feet.<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I sing the Praises of the Lord.<BR>
 I have erased all the pains of birth and death; meditating on the Lord, Har, Har, I have no fear of death. ||3||<BR>
 God is all-powerful, indescribable, unfathomable and divine.<BR>
 All beings and creatures serve Him.<BR>
 In so many ways, He cherishes those born from eggs, from the womb, from sweat and from the earth. ||4||<BR>
 He alone obtains this wealth,<BR>
 who savors and enjoys, deep within his mind, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Grasping hold of his arm, God lifts him up and pulls him out of the deep, dark pit. Such a devotee of the Lord is very rare. ||5||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 097</H2></CENTER>
 God exists in the beginning, in the middle and in the end.<BR>
 Whatever the Creator Lord Himself does, comes to pass.<BR>
 Doubt and fear are erased, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and then one is not afflicted by deadly pain. ||6||<BR>
 I sing the most Sublime Bani, the Word of the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 I beg for the dust of the feet of the Saadh Sangat.<BR>
 Eradicating desire, I have become free of desire; I have burnt away all my sins. ||7||<BR>
 This is the unique way of the Saints;<BR>
 they behold the Supreme Lord God with them.<BR>
 With each and every breath, they worship and adore the Lord, Har, Har. How could anyone be too lazy to meditate on Him? ||8||<BR>
 Wherever I look, there I see the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.<BR>
 I never forget God, my Lord and Master, even for an instant.<BR>
 Your slaves live by meditating, meditating in remembrance on the Lord; You are permeating the woods, the water and the land. ||9||<BR>
 Even the hot wind does not touch one<BR>
 who remains awake in meditative remembrance, night and day.<BR>
 He delights and enjoys meditative remembrance on the Lord; he has no attachment to Maya. ||10||<BR>
 Disease, sorrow and pain do not affect him;<BR>
 he sings the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<BR>
 Please bless me with Your Name, O my Beloved Lord God; please listen to my prayer, O Creator. ||11||<BR>
 Your Name is a jewel, O my Beloved Lord.<BR>
 Your slaves are imbued with Your Infinite Love.<BR>
 Those who are imbued with Your Love, become like You; it is so rare that they are found. ||12||<BR>
 My mind longs for the dust of the feet of those<BR>
 who never forget the Lord.<BR>
 Associating with them, I obtain the supreme status; the Lord, my Companion, is always with me. ||13||<BR>
 He alone is my beloved friend and companion,<BR>
 who implants the Name of the One Lord within, and eradicates evil-mindedness.<BR>
 Immaculate are the teachings of that humble servant of the Lord, who casts out sexual desire, anger and egotism. ||14||<BR>
 Other than You, O Lord, no one is mine.<BR>
 The Guru has led me to grasp the feet of God.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to the Perfect True Guru, who has destroyed the illusion of duality. ||15||<BR>
 With each and every breath, I never forget God.<BR>
 Twenty-four hours a day, I meditate on the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Saints are imbued with Your Love; You are the great and all-powerful Lord. ||16||4||13||<BR>
 Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 I enshrine the Lord's lotus feet continually within my heart.<BR>
 Each and every moment, I humbly bow to the Perfect Guru.<BR>
 I dedicate my body, mind and everything, and place it in offering before the Lord. His Name is the most beautiful in this world. ||1||<BR>
 Why forget the Lord and Master from your mind?<BR>
 He blessed you with body and soul, creating and embellishing you.<BR>
 With every breath and morsel of food, the Creator takes care of His beings, who receive according to what they have done. ||2||<BR>
 No one returns empty-handed from Him;<BR>
 twenty-four hours a day, keep the Lord in your mind.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 098</H2></CENTER>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, meditate and vibrate upon your imperishable Lord and Master, and you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 The four great blessings, and the eighteen miraculous spiritual powers,<BR>
 are found in the treasure of the Naam, which brings celestial peace and poise, and the nine treasures.<BR>
 If you yearn in your mind for all joys, then join the Saadh Sangat, and dwell upon your Lord and Master. ||4||<BR>
 The Shaastras, the Simritees and the Vedas proclaim<BR>
 that the mortal must be victorious in this priceless human life.<BR>
 Forsaking sexual desire, anger and slander, sing of the Lord with your tongue, O Nanak. ||5||<BR>
 He has no form or shape, no ancestry or social class.<BR>
 The Perfect Lord is perfectly pervading day and night.<BR>
 Whoever meditates on Him is very fortunate; he is not consigned to reincarnation again. ||6||<BR>
 One who forgets the Primal Lord, the Architect of karma,<BR>
 wanders around burning, and remains tormented.<BR>
 No one can save such an ungrateful person; he is thrown into the most horrible hell. ||7||<BR>
 He blessed you with your soul, the breath of life, your body and wealth;<BR>
 He preserved and nurtured you in your mother's womb.<BR>
 Forsaking His Love, you are imbued with another; you shall never achieve your goals like this. ||8||<BR>
 Please shower me with Your Merciful Grace, O my Lord and Master.<BR>
 You dwell in each and every heart, and are near everyone.<BR>
 Nothing is in my hands; he alone knows, whom You inspire to know. ||9||<BR>
 One who has such pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon his forehead,<BR>
 that person is not afflicted by Maya.<BR>
 Slave Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary forever; there is no other equal to You. ||10||<BR>
 In His Will, He made all pain and pleasure.<BR>
 How rare are those who remember the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 His value cannot be described. He is prevailing everywhere. ||11||<BR>
 He is the devotee; He is the Great Giver.<BR>
 He is the Perfect Primal Lord, the Architect of karma.<BR>
 He is your help and support, since infancy; He fulfills your mind's desires. ||12||<BR>
 Death, pain and pleasure are ordained by the Lord.<BR>
 They do not increase or decrease by anyone's efforts.<BR>
 That alone happens, which is pleasing to the Creator; speaking of himself, the mortal ruins himself. ||13||<BR>
 He lifts us up and pulls us out of the deep dark pit;<BR>
 He unites with Himself, those who were separated for so many incarnations.<BR>
 Showering them with His Mercy, He protects them with His own hands. Meeting with the Holy Saints, they meditate on the Lord of the Universe. ||14||<BR>
 Your worth cannot be described.<BR>
 Wondrous is Your form, and Your glorious greatness.<BR>
 Your humble servant begs for the gift of devotional worship. Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You. ||15||1||14||22||24||2||14||62||<BR>
 Vaar Of Maaroo, Third Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
 If virtue is sold when there is no buyer, then it is sold very cheap.<BR>
 But if one meets a buyer of virtue, then virtue sells for hundreds of thousands.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 099</H2></CENTER>
 Meeting with a virtuous person, virtue is obtained, and one is immersed in the True Guru.<BR>
 Priceless virtues are not obtained for any price; they cannot be purchased in a store.<BR>
 O Nanak, their weight is full and perfect; it never decreases at all. ||1||<BR>
 Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they wander around, continually coming and going in reincarnation.<BR>
 Some are in bondage, and some are set free; some are happy in the Love of the Lord.<BR>
 O Nanak, believe in the True Lord, and practice Truth, through the lifestyle of Truth. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 From the Guru, I have obtained the supremely powerful sword of spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 I have cut down the fortress of duality and doubt, attachment, greed and egotism.<BR>
 The Name of the Lord abides within my mind; I contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 Through Truth, self-discipline and sublime understanding, the Lord has become very dear to me.<BR>
 Truly, truly, the True Creator Lord is all-pervading. ||1||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Among the ragas, Kaydaaraa Raga is known as good, O Siblings of Destiny, if through it, one comes to love the Word of the Shabad,<BR>
 and if one remains in the Soceity of the Saints, and enshrines love for the True Lord.<BR>
 Such a person washes away the pollution from within, and saves his generations as well.<BR>
 He gathes in the capital of virtue, and destroys and drives out unvirtuous sins.<BR>
 O Nanak, he alone is known as united, who does not forsake his Guru, and who does not love duality. ||1||<BR>
 Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 Gazing upon the world-ocean, I am afraid of death; but if I live in the Fear of You, God, then I am not afraid.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I am content; O Nanak, I blossom forth in the Name. ||2||<BR>
 Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 I get on board the boat and set out, but the ocean is churning with waves.<BR>
 The boat of Truth encounters no obstruction, if the Guru gives encouragement.<BR>
 He takes us across to the door on the other side, as the Guru keeps watch.<BR>
 O Nanak, if I am blessed with His Grace, I shall go to His Court with honor. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Enjoy your kingdom of bliss; as Gurmukh, practice Truth.<BR>
 Sitting upon the throne of Truth, the Lord administers justice; He unites us in Union with the Society of the Saints.<BR>
 Meditating on the Lord, through the True Teachings, we become just like the Lord.<BR>
 If the Lord, the Giver of peace, abides in the mind, in this world, then in the end, He becomes our help and support.<BR>
 Love for the Lord wells up, when the Guru imparts understanding. ||2||<BR>
 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
 Confused and deluded, I wander around, but no one shows me the way.<BR>
 I go and ask the clever people, if there is there anyone who can rid me of my pain.<BR>
 If the True Guru abides within my mind, then I see the Lord, my best friend, there.<BR>
 O Nanak, my mind is satisfied and fulfilled, contemplating the Praises of the True Name. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 He Himself is the Doer, and He is the deed; He Himself issues the Command.<BR>
 He Himself forgives some, and He Himself does the deed.<BR>
 O Nanak, receiving the Divine Light from the Guru, suffering and corruption are burnt away, through the Name. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Don't be fooled by gazing at the riches of Maya, you foolish self-willed manmukh.<BR>
 It shall not go along with you when you must depart; all the wealth you see is false.<BR>
 The blind and ignorant do not understand, that the sword of death is hanging over their heads.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, those who drink in the sublime essence of the Lord are saved.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 100</H2></CENTER>
 He Himself is the Doer, and He Himself is the Cause; the Lord Himself is our Saving Grace. ||3||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Those who do not meet with the Guru, who have no Fear of God at all,<BR>
 continue coming and going in reincarnation, and suffer terrible pain; their anxiety is never relieved.<BR>
 They are beaten like clothes being washed on the rocks, and struck every hour like chimes.<BR>
 O Nanak, without the True Name, these entanglements are not removed from hanging over one's head. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 I have searched throughout the three worlds, O my friend; egotism is bad for the world.<BR>
 Don't worry, O my soul; speak the Truth, O Nanak, the Truth, and only the Truth. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The Lord Himself forgives the Gurmukhs; they are absorbed and immersed in the Lord's Name.<BR>
 He Himself links them to devotional worship; they bear the Insignia of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 Those who turn towards the Guru, as sunmukh, are beautiful. They are famous in the Court of the True Lord.<BR>
 In this world, and in the world hereafter, they are liberated; they realize the Lord.<BR>
 Blessed, blessed are those humble beings who serve the Lord. I am a sacrifice to them. ||4||<BR>
 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
 The rude, ill-mannered bride is encased in the body-tomb; she is blackened, and her mind is impure.<BR>
 She can enjoy her Husband Lord, only if she is virtuous. O Nanak, the soul-bride is unworthy, and without virtue. ||1||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 She has good conduct, true self-discipline, and a perfect family.<BR>
 O Nanak, day and night, she is always good; she loves her Beloved Husband Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 One who realizes his own self, is blessed with the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Granting His Mercy, the Guru merges him in the Word of His Shabad.<BR>
 The Word of the Guru's Bani is immaculate and pure; through it, one drinks in the sublime essence of the Lord.<BR>
 Those who taste the sublime essence of the Lord, forsake other flavors.<BR>
 Drinking in the sublime essence of the Lord, they remain satisfied forever; their hunger and thirst are quenched. ||5||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Her Husband Lord is pleased, and He enjoys His bride; the soul-bride adorns her heart with the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 O Nanak, that bride who stands before Him, is the most noble and respected woman. ||1||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 In her father-in-law's home hereafter, and in her parents' home in this world, she belongs to her Husband Lord. Her Husband is inaccessible and unfathomable.<BR>
 O Nanak, she is the happy soul-bride, who is pleasing to her carefree, independent Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 That king sits upon the throne, who is worthy of that throne.<BR>
 Those who realize the True Lord, they alone are the true kings.<BR>
 These mere earthly rulers are not called kings; in the love of duality, they suffer.<BR>
 Why should someone praise someone else who is also created? They depart in no time at all.<BR>
 The One True Lord is eternal and imperishable. One who, as Gurmukh, understands becomes eternal as well. ||6||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The One Lord is the Husband of all. No one is without the Husband Lord.<BR>
 O Nanak, they are the pure soul-brides, who merge in the True Guru. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 The mind is churning with so many waves of desire. How can one be emancipated in the Court of the Lord?<BR>
 Be absorbed in the Lord's True Love, and imbued with the deep color of the Lord's Infinite Love.<BR>
 O Nanak, by Guru's Grace, one is emancipated, if the consciousness is attached to the True Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The Name of the Lord is priceless. How can its value be estimated?<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 101</H2></CENTER>
 He Himself created the entire universe, and He Himself is pervading it.<BR>
 The Gurmukhs praise the Lord forever, and through the Truth, they assess Him.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the heart-lotus blossoms forth, and in this way, one drinks in the sublime essence of the Lord.<BR>
 Coming and going in reincarnation ceases, and one sleeps in peace and poise. ||7||<BR>
 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
 Neither dirty, nor dull, nor saffron, nor any color that fades.<BR>
 O Nanak, crimson - deep crimson is the color of one who is imbued with the True Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 The bumble bee intuitively and fearlessly dwells among the vegetation, flowers and fruits.<BR>
 O Nanak, there is only one tree, one flower, and one bumble bee. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Those humble beings who struggle with their minds are brave and distinguished heroes.<BR>
 Those who realize their own selves, remain forever united with the Lord.<BR>
 This is the glory of the spiritual teachers, that they remain absorbed in their mind.<BR>
 They attain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, and focus their meditation on the True Lord.<BR>
 Those who conquer their own minds, by Guru's Grace, conquer the world. ||8||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 If I were to become a Yogi, and wander around the world, begging from door to door,<BR>
 then, when I am summoned to the Court of the Lord, what answer could I give?<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the charity I beg for; contentment is my temple. The True Lord is always with me.<BR>
 Nothing is obtained by wearing religious robes; all will be seized by the Messenger of Death.<BR>
 O Nanak, talk is false; contemplate the True Name. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 Through that door, you will be called to account; do not serve at that door.<BR>
 Seek and find such a True Guru, who has no equal in His greatness.<BR>
 In His Sanctuary, one is released, and no one calls him to account.<BR>
 Truth is implanted within Him, and He implants Truth within others. He bestows the blessing of the True Shabad.<BR>
 One who has Truth within his heart - his body and mind are also true.<BR>
 O Nanak, if one submits to the Hukam, the Command of the True Lord God, he is blessed with true glory and greatness.<BR>
 He is immersed and merged in the True Lord, who blesses him with His Glance of Grace. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 They are not called heroes, who die of egotism, suffering in pain.<BR>
 The blind ones do not realize their own selves; in the love of duality, they rot.<BR>
 They struggle with great anger; here and hereafter, they suffer in pain.<BR>
 The Dear Lord is not pleased by egotism; the Vedas proclaim this clearly.<BR>
 Those who die of egotism, shall not find salvation. They die, and are reborn in reincarnation. ||9||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The crow does not become white, and an iron boat does not float across.<BR>
 One who puts his faith in the treasure of his Beloved Lord is blessed; he exalts and embellishes others as well.<BR>
 One who realizes the Hukam of God's Command - his face is radiant and bright; he floats across, like iron upon wood.<BR>
 Forsake thirst and desire, and abide in the Fear of God; O Nanak, these are the most excellent actions. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 The ignorant people who go to the desert to conquer their minds, are not able to conquer them.<BR>
 O Nanak, if this mind is to be conquered, one must contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 This mind is not conquered by conquering it, even though everyone longs to do so.<BR>
 O Nanak, the mind itself conquers the mind, if one meets with the True Guru. ||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 102</H2></CENTER>
 Pauree:<BR>
 He created both sides; Shiva dwells within Shakti (the soul dwells within the material universe).<BR>
 Through the material universe of Shakti, no one has ever found the Lord; they continue to be born and die in reincarnation.<BR>
 Serving the Guru, peace is found, meditating on the Lord with every breath and morsel of food.<BR>
 Searching and looking through the Simritees and the Shaastras, I have found that the most sublime person is the slave of the Lord.<BR>
 O Nanak, without the Naam, nothing is permanent and stable; I am a sacrifice to the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||10||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 I might become a Pandit, a religious scholar, or an astrologer, and recite the four Vedas with my mouth;<BR>
 I might be worshipped throughout the nine regions of the earth for my wisdom and thought;<BR>
 let me not forget the Word of Truth, that no one can touch my sacred cooking square.<BR>
 Such cooking squares are false, O Nanak; only the One Lord is True. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 He Himself creates and He Himself acts; He bestows His Glance of Grace.<BR>
 He Himself grants glorious greatness; says Nanak, He is the True Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Only death is painful; I cannot conceive of anything else as painful.<BR>
 It is unstoppable; it stalks and pervades the world, and fights with the sinners.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one is immersed in the Lord. Meditating on the Lord, one comes to realize the Lord.<BR>
 He alone is emancipated in the Sanctuary of the Lord, who struggles with his own mind.<BR>
 One who contemplates and meditates on the Lord in his mind, succeeds in the Court of the Lord. ||11||<BR>
 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
 Submit to the Will of the Lord Commander; in His Court, only Truth is accepted.<BR>
 Your Lord and Master shall call you to account; do not go astray on beholding the world.<BR>
 One who keeps watch over his heart, and keeps his heart pure, is a dervish, a saintly devotee.<BR>
 Love and affection, O Nanak, are in the accounts placed before the Creator. ||1||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 One who is unattached like the bumble bee, sees the Lord of the world everywhere.<BR>
 The diamond of his mind is pierced through with the Diamond of the Lord's Name; O Nanak, his neck is embellished with it. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs are afflicted by death; they cling to Maya in emotional attachment.<BR>
 In an instant, they are thrown to the ground and killed; in the love of duality, they are deluded.<BR>
 This opportunity shall not come into their hands again; they are beaten by the Messenger of Death with his stick.<BR>
 But Death's stick does not even strike those who remain awake and aware in the Love of the Lord.<BR>
 All are Yours, and cling to You; only You can save them. ||12||<BR>
 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
 See the imperishable Lord everywhere; attachment to wealth brings only great pain.<BR>
 Loaded with dust, you have to cross over the world-ocean; you are not carrying the profit and capital of the Name with you. ||1||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 My capital is Your True Name, O Lord; this wealth is inexhaustible and infinite.<BR>
 O Nanak, this merchandise is immaculate; blessed is the banker who trades in it. ||2||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 Know and enjoy the primal, eternal Love of the Great Lord and Master.<BR>
 Blessed with the Naam, O Nanak, you shall strike down the Messenger of Death, and push his face to the ground. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 He Himself has embellished the body, and placed the nine treasures of the Naam within it.<BR>
 He confuses some in doubt; fruitless are their actions.<BR>
 Some, as Gurmukh, realize their Lord, the Supreme Soul.<BR>
 Some listen to the Lord, and obey Him; sublime and exalted are their actions.<BR>
 Love for the Lord wells up deep within, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name. ||13||<BR>
 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 103</H2></CENTER>
 The Fear of God abides in the mind of the innocent; this is the straight path to the One Lord.<BR>
 Jealousy and envy bring terrible pain, and one is cursed throughout the three worlds. ||1||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 The drum of the Vedas vibrates, bringing dispute and divisiveness.<BR>
 O Nanak, contemplate the Naam, the Name of the Lord; there is none except Him. ||2||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 The world-ocean of the three qualities is unfathomably deep; how can its bottom be seen?<BR>
 If I meet with the great, self-sufficient True Guru, then I am carried across.<BR>
 This ocean is filled up with pain and suffering.<BR>
 O Nanak, without the True Name, no one's hunger is appeased. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Those who search their inner beings, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, are exalted and adorned.<BR>
 They obtain what they wish for, meditating on the Lord's Name.<BR>
 One who is blessed by God's Grace, meets with the Guru; he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<BR>
 The Righteous Judge of Dharma is his friend; he does not have to walk on the Path of Death.<BR>
 He meditates on the Lord's Name, day and night; he is absorbed and immersed in the Lord's Name. ||14||<BR>
 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
 Listen to and speak the Name of the One Lord, who permeates the heavens, this world and the nether regions of the underworld.<BR>
 The Hukam of His Command cannot be erased; whatever He has written, shall go with the mortal.<BR>
 Who has died, and who kills? Who comes and who goes?<BR>
 Who is enraptured, O Nanak, and whose consciousness merges in the Lord? ||1||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 In egotism, he dies; possessiveness kills him, and the breath flows out like a river.<BR>
 Desire is exhausted, O Nanak, only when the mind is imbued with the Name.<BR>
 His eyes are imbued with the eyes of the Lord, and his ears ring with celestial consciousness.<BR>
 His tongue drinks in the sweet nectar, dyed crimson by chanting the Name of the Beloved Lord.<BR>
 His inner being is drenched with the Lord's fragrance; his worth cannot be described. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 In this age, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the treasure. Only the Naam goes along in the end.<BR>
 It is inexhaustible; it is never empty, no matter how much one may eat, consume or spend.<BR>
 The Messenger of Death does not even approach the humble servant of the Lord.<BR>
 They alone are the true bankers and traders, who have the wealth of the Lord in their laps.<BR>
 By the Lord's Mercy, one finds the Lord, only when the Lord Himself sends for him. ||15||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh does not appreciate the excellence of trading in Truth. He deals in poison, collects poison, and is in love with poison.<BR>
 Outwardly, they call themselves Pandits, religious scholars, but in their minds they are foolish and ignorant.<BR>
 They do not focus their consciousness on the Lord; they love to engage in arguments.<BR>
 They speak to cause arguments, and earn their living by telling lies.<BR>
 In this world, only the Lord's Name is immaculate and pure. All other objects of creation are polluted.<BR>
 O Nanak, those who do not remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are polluted; they die in ignorance. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 Without serving the Lord, he suffers in pain; accepting the Hukam of God's Command, pain is gone.<BR>
 He Himself is the Giver of peace; He Himself awards punishment.<BR>
 O Nanak, know this well; all that happens is according to His Will. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Without the Lord's Name, the world is poor. Without the Name, no one is satisfied.<BR>
 He is deluded by duality and doubt. In egotism, he suffers in pain.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 104</H2></CENTER>
 Without good karma, he does not obtain anything, no matter how much he may wish for it.<BR>
 Coming and going in reincarnation, and birth and death are ended, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 He Himself acts, so unto whom should we complain? There is no other at all. ||16||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 In this world, the Saints earn the wealth; they come to meet God through the True Guru.<BR>
 The True Guru implants the Truth within; the value of this wealth cannot be described.<BR>
 Obtaining this wealth, hunger is relieved, and peace comes to dwell in the mind.<BR>
 Only those who have such pre-ordained destiny, come to receive this.<BR>
 The world of the self-willed manmukh is poor, crying out for Maya.<BR>
 Night and day, it wanders continually, and its hunger is never relieved.<BR>
 It never finds calm tranquility, and peace never comes to dwell in its mind.<BR>
 It is always plagued by anxiety, and its cynicism never departs.<BR>
 O Nanak, without the True Guru, the intellect is perverted; if one meets the True Guru, then one practices the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 Forever and ever, he dwells in peace, and merges in the True Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 The One who created the world, takes care of it.<BR>
 Meditate in remembrance on the One Lord, O Siblings of Destiny; there is none other than Him.<BR>
 So eat the food of the Shabad and goodness; eating it, you shall remain satisfied forever.<BR>
 Dress yourself in the Praise of the Lord. Forever and ever, it is radiant and bright; it is never polluted.<BR>
 I have intuitively earned the true wealth, which never decreases.<BR>
 The body is adorned with the Shabad, and is at peace forever and ever.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh realizes the Lord, who reveals Himself. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Deep within the self are meditation and austere self-discipline, when one realizes the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 Meditating on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, egotism and ignorance are eliminated.<BR>
 One's inner being is overflowing with Ambrosial Nectar; tasting it, the flavor is known.<BR>
 Those who taste it become fearless; they are satisfied with the sublime essence of the Lord.<BR>
 Those who drink it in, by the Grace of the Lord, are never again afflicted by death. ||17||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 People tie up bundles of demerits; no one deals in virtue.<BR>
 Rare is that person, O Nanak, who purchases virtue.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, one is blessed with virtue, when the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 Merits and demerits are the same; they are both created by the Creator.<BR>
 O Nanak, one who obeys the Hukam of the Lord's Command, finds peace, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The King sits on the throne within the self; He Himself administers justice.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord's Court is known; within the self is the Sanctuary, the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.<BR>
 The coins are assayed, and the genuine coins are placed in His treasury, while the counterfeit ones find no place.<BR>
 The Truest of the True is all-pervading; His justice is forever True.<BR>
 One comes to enjoy the Ambrosial essence, when the Name is enshrined in the mind. ||18||<BR>
 Shalok, First Mehl:<BR>
 When one acts in egotism, then You are not there, Lord. Wherever You are, there is no ego.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 105</H2></CENTER>
 O spiritual teachers, understand this: the Unspoken Speech is in the mind.<BR>
 Without the Guru, the essence of reality is not found; the Invisible Lord dwells everywhere.<BR>
 One meets the True Guru, and then the Lord is known, when the Word of the Shabad comes to dwell in the mind.<BR>
 When self-conceit departs, doubt and fear also depart, and the pain of birth and death is removed.<BR>
 Following the Guru's Teachings, the Unseen Lord is seen; the intellect is exalted, and one is carried across.<BR>
 O Nanak, chant the chant of 'Sohang hansaa' - 'He is me, and I am Him.' The three worlds are absorbed in Him. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 Some assay their mind-jewel, and contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 Only a few of those humble beings are known in this world, in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.<BR>
 One's self remains blended with the Lord's Self, when egotism and duality are conquered.<BR>
 O Nanak, those who are imbued with the Naam cross over the difficult, treacherous and terrifying world-ocean. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs do not search within their own selves; they are deluded by their egotistical pride.<BR>
 Wandering in the four directions, they grow weary, tormented by burning desire within.<BR>
 They do not study the Simritees and the Shaastras; the manmukhs waste away and are lost.<BR>
 Without the Guru, no one finds the Naam, the Name of the True Lord.<BR>
 One who contemplates the essence of spiritual wisdom and meditates on the Lord is saved. ||19||<BR>
 Shalok, Second Mehl:<BR>
 He Himself knows, He Himself acts, and He Himself does it right.<BR>
 So stand before Him, O Nanak, and offer your prayers. ||1||<BR>
 First Mehl:<BR>
 He who created the creation, watches over it; He Himself knows.<BR>
 Unto whom should I speak, O Nanak, when everything is contained within the home of the heart? ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Forget everything, and be friends with the One Lord alone.<BR>
 Your mind and body shall be enraptured, and the Lord shall burn away your sins.<BR>
 Your comings and goings in reincarnation shall cease; you shall not be reborn and die again.<BR>
 The True Name shall be your Support, and you shall not burn in sorrow and attachment.<BR>
 O Nanak, gather in the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within your mind. ||20||<BR>
 Shalok, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 You do not forget Maya from your mind; you beg for it with each and every breath.<BR>
 You do not even think of that God; O Nanak, it is not in your karma. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Maya and its wealth shall not go along with you, so why do you cling to it - are you blind?<BR>
 Meditate on the Guru's Feet, and the bonds of Maya shall be cut away from you. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 By the Pleasure of His Will, the Lord inspires us to obey the Hukam of His Command; by the Pleasure of His Will, we find peace.<BR>
 By the Pleasure of His Will, He leads us to meet the True Guru; by the Pleasure of His Will, we meditate on the Truth.<BR>
 There is no other gift as great as the Pleasure of His Will; this Truth is spoken and proclaimed.<BR>
 Those who have such pre-ordained destiny, practice and live the Truth.<BR>
 Nanak has entered His Sanctuary; He created the world. ||21||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Those who do not have spiritual wisdom within, do not have even an iota of the Fear of God.<BR>
 O Nanak, why kill those who are already dead? The Lord of the Universe Himself has killed them. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 To read the horoscope of the mind, is the most sublime joyful peace.<BR>
 He alone is called a good Brahmin, who understands God in contemplative meditation.<BR>
 He praises the Lord, and reads of the Lord, and contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 106</H2></CENTER>
 Celebrated and approved is the coming into the world of such a person, who saves all his generations as well.<BR>
 Hereafter, no one is questioned about social status; excellent and sublime is the practice of the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 Other study is false, and other actions are false; such people are in love with poison.<BR>
 They do not find any peace within themselves; the self-willed manmukhs waste away their lives.<BR>
 O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam are saved; they have infinite love for the Guru. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 He Himself creates the creation, and gazes upon it; He Himself is totally True.<BR>
 One who does not understand the Hukam, the Command of his Lord and Master, is false.<BR>
 By the Pleasure of His Will, the True Lord joins the Gurmukh to Himself.<BR>
 He is the One Lord and Master of all; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, we are blended with Him.<BR>
 The Gurmukhs praise Him forever; all are beggars of Him.<BR>
 O Nanak, as He Himself makes us dance, we dance. ||22||1||<BR>

 Vaar Of Maaroo, Fifth Mehl, Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 If You tell me to, O my Friend, I will cut off my head and give it to You.<BR>
 My eyes long for You; when will I see Your Vision? ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I am in love with You; I have seen that other love is false.<BR>
 Even clothes and food are frightening to me, as long as I do not see my Beloved. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I rise early, O my Husband Lord, to behold Your Vision.<BR>
 Eye make-up, garlands of flowers, and the flavor of betel leaf, are all nothing but dust, without seeing You. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 You are True, O my True Lord and Master; You uphold all that is true.<BR>
 You created the world, making a place for the Gurmukhs.<BR>
 By the Will of the Lord, the Vedas came into being; they discriminate between sin and virtue.<BR>
 You created Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, and the expanse of the three qualities.<BR>
 Creating the world of the nine regions, O Lord, You have embellished it with beauty.<BR>
 Creating the beings of various kinds, You infused Your power into them.<BR>
 No one knows Your limit, O True Creator Lord.<BR>
 You Yourself know all ways and means; You Yourself save the Gurmukhs. ||1||<BR>
 Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 If You are my friend, then don't separate Yourself from me, even for an instant.<BR>
 My soul is fascinated and enticed by You; when will I see You, O my Love? ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Burn in the fire, you evil person; O separation, be dead.<BR>
 O my Husband Lord, please sleep upon my bed, that all my sufferings may be gone. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The evil person is engrossed in the love of duality; through the disease of egotism, he suffers separation.<BR>
 The True Lord King is my friend; meeting with Him, I am so happy. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 You are inaccessible, merciful and infinite; who can estimate Your worth?<BR>
 You created the entire universe; You are the Master of all the worlds.<BR>
 No one knows Your creative power, O my all-pervading Lord and Master.<BR>
 No one can equal You; You are imperishable and eternal, the Savior of the world.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 107</H2></CENTER>
 You established the four ages; You are the Creator of all worlds.<BR>
 You created the comings and goings of reincarnation; not even a particle of filth sticks to You.<BR>
 As you are merciful, You attach us to the Feet of the True Guru.<BR>
 You cannot be found by any other efforts; You are the eternal, imperishable Creator of the Universe. ||2||<BR>
 Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 If You come into my courtyard, all the earth becomes beautiful.<BR>
 Other than the One Lord, my Husband, no one else cares for me. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 All my adornments become beautiful, when You, O Lord, sit in my courtyard and make it Yours.<BR>
 Then no traveller who comes to my home shall leave empty-handed. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I have spread out my bed for You, O my Husband Lord, and applied all my decorations.<BR>
 But even this is not pleasing to me, to wear a garland around my neck. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 O Supreme Lord God, O Transcendent Lord, You do not take birth.<BR>
 By the Hukam of Your Command, You formed the Universe; forming it, You merge into it.<BR>
 Your Form cannot be known; how can one meditate on You?<BR>
 You are pervading and permeating all; You Yourself reveal Your creative potency.<BR>
 Your treasures of devotional worship are overflowing; they never decrease.<BR>
 These gems, jewels and diamonds - their value cannot be estimated.<BR>
 As You Yourself become merciful, Lord, You link us to the service of the True Guru.<BR>
 One who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, never suffers any deficiency. ||3||<BR>
 Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 When I look within my being, I find that my Beloved is with me.<BR>
 All pains are relieved, O Nanak, when He bestows His Glance of Grace. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Nanak sits, waiting for news of the Lord, and stands at the Lord's Door; serving Him for so long.<BR>
 O my Beloved, only You know my objective; I stand, waiting to see the Lord's face. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 What should I say to you, you fool? Don't look at the vines of others - be a true husband.<BR>
 O Nanak, the entire world is blooming, like a garden of flowers. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 You are Wise, all-knowing and beautiful; You are pervading and permeating all.<BR>
 You Yourself are the Lord and Master, and the servant; You worship and adore Yourself.<BR>
 You are all-wise and all-seeing; You Yourself are true and pure.<BR>
 The Immaculate Lord, my Lord God, is celibate and True.<BR>
 God spreads out the expanse of the entire universe, and He Himself plays in it.<BR>
 He created this coming and going of reincarnation; creating the wondrous play, He gazes upon it.<BR>
 One who is blessed with the Guru's Teachings, is not consigned to the womb of reincarnation, ever again.<BR>
 All walk as He makes them walk; nothing is under the control of the created beings. ||4||<BR>
 Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 You are walking along the river-bank, but the land is giving way beneath you.<BR>
 Watch out! Your foot might slip, and you'll fall in and die. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 You believe what is false and temporary to be true, and so you run on and on.<BR>
 O Nanak, like butter in the fire, it shall melt away; it shall fade away like the water-lily. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 O my foolish and silly soul, why are you too lazy to serve?<BR>
 Such a long time has passed. When will this opportunity come again? ||3||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 108</H2></CENTER>
 Pauree:<BR>
 You have no form or shape, no social class or race.<BR>
 These humans believe that You are far away; but You are quite obviously apparent.<BR>
 You enjoy Yourself in every heart, and no filth sticks to You.<BR>
 You are the blissful and infinite Primal Lord God; Your Light is all-pervading.<BR>
 Among all divine beings, You are the most divine, O Creator-architect, Rejuvenator of all.<BR>
 How can my single tongue worship and adore You? You are the eternal, imperishable, infinite Lord God.<BR>
 One whom You Yourself unite with the True Guru - all his generations are saved.<BR>
 All Your servants serve You; Nanak is a humble servant at Your Door. ||5||<BR>
 Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 He builds a hut of straw, and the fool lights a fire in it.<BR>
 Only those who have such pre-ordained destiny on their foreheads, find Shelter with the Master. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 O Nanak, he grinds the corn, cooks it and places it before himself.<BR>
 But without his True Guru, he sits and waits for his food to be blessed. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 O Nanak, the loaves of bread are baked and placed on the plate.<BR>
 Those who obey their Guru, eat and are totally satisfied. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 You have staged this play in the world, and infused egotism into all beings.<BR>
 In the one temple of the body are the five thieves, who continually misbehave.<BR>
 The ten brides, the sensory organs were created, and the one husband, the self; the ten are engrossed in flavors and tastes.<BR>
 This Maya fascinates and entices them; they wander continually in doubt.<BR>
 You created both sides, spirit and matter, Shiva and Shakti.<BR>
 Matter loses out to spirit; this is pleasing to the Lord.<BR>
 You enshrined spirit within, which leads to merger with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.<BR>
 Within the bubble, You formed the bubble, which shall once again merge into the water. ||6||<BR>
 Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Look ahead; don't turn your face backwards.<BR>
 O Nanak, be successful this time, and you shall not be reincarnated again. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 My joyful friend is called the friend of all.<BR>
 All think of Him as their own; He never breaks anyone's heart. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The hidden jewel has been found; it has appeared on my forehead.<BR>
 Beautiful and exalted is that place, O Nanak, where You dwell, O my Dear Lord. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 When You are on my side, Lord, what do I need to worry about?<BR>
 You entrusted everything to me, when I became Your slave.<BR>
 My wealth is inexhaustible, no matter how much I spend and consume.<BR>
 The 8.4 million species of beings all work to serve me.<BR>
 All these enemies have become my friends, and no one wishes me ill.<BR>
 No one calls me to account, since God is my forgiver.<BR>
 I have become blissful, and I have found peace, meeting with the Guru, the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 All my affairs have been resolved, since You are pleased with me. ||7||<BR>
 Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I am so eager to see You, O Lord; what does Your face look like?<BR>
 I wandered around in such a miserable state, but when I saw You, my mind was comforted and consoled. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 109</H2></CENTER>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The miserable endure so much suffering and pain; You alone know their pain, Lord.<BR>
 I may know hundreds of thousands of remedies, but I shall live only if I see my Husband Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I have seen the river-bank washed away by the raging waters of the river.<BR>
 They alone remain intact, who meet with the True Guru. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 No pain afflicts that humble being who hungers for You, Lord.<BR>
 That humble Gurmukh who understands, is celebrated in the four directions.<BR>
 Sins run away from that man, who seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord.<BR>
 The filth of countless incarnations is washed away, bathing in the dust of the Guru's feet.<BR>
 Whoever submits to the Lord's Will does not suffer in sorrow.<BR>
 O Dear Lord, You are the friend of all; all believe that You are theirs.<BR>
 The glory of the Lord's humble servant is as great as the Glorious Radiance of the Lord.<BR>
 Among all, His humble servant is pre-eminent; through His humble servant, the Lord is known. ||8||<BR>
 Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Those whom I followed, now follow me.<BR>
 Those in whom I placed my hopes, now place their hopes in me. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The fly flies around, and comes to the wet lump of molasses.<BR>
 Whoever sits on it, is caught; they alone are saved, who have good destiny on their foreheads. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I see Him within all. No one is without Him.<BR>
 Good destiny is inscribed on the forehead of that companion, who who enjoys the Lord, my Friend. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 I am a minstrel at His Door, singing His Glorious Praises, to please to my Lord God.<BR>
 My God is permanent and stable; others continue coming and going.<BR>
 I beg for that gift from the Lord of the World, which will satisfy my hunger.<BR>
 O Dear Lord God, please bless Your minstrel with the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, that I might be satisfied and fulfilled.<BR>
 God, the Great Giver, hears the prayer, and summons the minstrel to the Mansion of His Presence.<BR>
 Gazing upon God, the minstrel is rid of pain and hunger; he does not think to ask for anything else.<BR>
 All desires are fulfilled, touching the feet of God.<BR>
 I am His humble, unworthy minstrel; the Primal Lord God has forgiven me. ||9||<BR>
 Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 When the soul leaves, you shall become dust, O vacant body; why do you not realize your Husband Lord?<BR>
 You are in love with evil people; by what virtues will you enjoy the Lord's Love? ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 O Nanak, without Him, you cannot survive, even for an instant; you cannot afford to forget Him, even for a moment.<BR>
 Why are you alienated from Him, O my mind? He takes care of you. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Those who are imbued with the Love of the Supreme Lord God, their minds and bodies are colored deep crimson.<BR>
 O Nanak, without the Name, other thoughts are polluted and corrupt. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 O Dear Lord, when You are my friend, what sorrow can afflict me?<BR>
 You have beaten off and destroyed the cheats that cheat the world.<BR>
 The Guru has carried me across the terrifying world-ocean, and I have won the battle.<BR>
 Through the Guru's Teachings, I enjoy all the pleasures in the great world-arena.<BR>
 The True Lord has brought all my senses and organs under my control.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 110</H2></CENTER>
 Wherever I join them, there they are joined; they do not struggle against me.<BR>
 I obtain the fruits of my desires; the Guru has directed me within.<BR>
 When Guru Nanak is pleased, O Siblings of Destiny, the Lord is seen to be dwelling near at hand. ||10||<BR>
 Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 When You come into my consciousness, then I obtain all peace and comfort.<BR>
 Nanak: with Your Name within my mind, O my Husband Lord, I am filled with delight. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Enjoyment of clothes and corrupt pleasures - all these are nothing more than dust.<BR>
 I long for the dust of the feet of those who are imbued with the Lord's Vision. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Why do you look in other directions? O my heart, take the Support of the Lord alone.<BR>
 Become the dust of the feet of the Saints, and find the Lord, the Giver of peace. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Without good karma, the Dear Lord is not found; without the True Guru, the mind is not joined to Him.<BR>
 Only the Dharma remains stable in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga; these sinners will not last at all.<BR>
 Whatever one does with this hand, he obtains with the other hand, without a moment's delay.<BR>
 I have examined the four ages, and without the Sangat, the Holy Congregation, egotism does not depart.<BR>
 Egotism is never eradicated without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<BR>
 As long as one's mind is torn away from his Lord and Master, he finds no place of rest.<BR>
 That humble being, who, as Gurmukh, serves the Lord, has the Support of the Imperishable Lord in the home of his heart.<BR>
 By the Lord's Grace, peace is obtained, and one is attached to the feet of the Guru, the True Guru. ||11||<BR>
 Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I have searched everywhere for the King over the heads of kings.<BR>
 That Master is within my heart; I chant His Name with my mouth. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 O my mother, the Master has blessed me with the jewel.<BR>
 My heart is cooled and soothed, chanting the True Name with my mouth. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I have become the bed for my Beloved Husband Lord; my eyes have become the sheets.<BR>
 If You look at me, even for an instant, then I obtain peace beyond all price. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 My mind longs to meet the Lord; how can I obtain the Blessed Vision of His Darshan?<BR>
 I obtain hundreds of thousands, if my Lord and Master speaks to me, even for an instant.<BR>
 I have searched in four directions; there is no other as great as You, Lord.<BR>
 Show me the Path, O Saints. How can I meet God?<BR>
 I dedicate my mind to Him, and renounce my ego. This is the Path which I shall take.<BR>
 Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I serve my Lord and Master continually.<BR>
 All my hopes are fulfilled; the Guru has ushered me into the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.<BR>
 I cannot conceive of any other as great as You, O my Friend, O Lord of the World. ||12||<BR>
 Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I have become the throne for my Beloved Lord King.<BR>
 If You place Your foot on me, I blossom forth like the lotus flower. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 If my Beloved becomes hungry, I will become food, and place myself before Him.<BR>
 I may be crushed, again and again, but like sugarcane, I do not stop yielding sweet juice. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Break off your love with the cheaters; realize that it is a mirage.<BR>
 Your pleasure lasts for only two moments; this traveller wanders through countless homes. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 God is not found by intellectual devices; He is unknowable and unseen.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 111</H2></CENTER>
 The followers of the six orders wander and roam around wearing religious robes, but they do not meet God.<BR>
 They keep the lunar fasts, but they are of no account.<BR>
 Those who read the Vedas in their entirety, still do not see the sublime essence of reality.<BR>
 They apply ceremonial marks to their foreheads, and take cleansing baths, but they are blackened within.<BR>
 They wear religious robes, but without the True Teachings, God is not found.<BR>
 One who had strayed, finds the Path again, if such pre-ordained destiny is written on his forehead.<BR>
 One who sees the Guru with his eyes, embellishes and exalts his human life. ||13||<BR>
 Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Focus on that which will not pass away.<BR>
 Abandon your false actions, and meditate on the True Master. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 God's Light is permeating all, like the moon reflected in the water.<BR>
 He Himself is revealed, O Nanak, to one who has such destiny inscribed upon his forehead. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One's face becomes beautiful, chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and singing His Glorious Praises, twenty-four hours a day.<BR>
 O Nanak, in the Court of the Lord, you shall be accepted; even the homeless find a home there. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 By wearing religious robes outwardly, God, the Inner-knower is not found.<BR>
 Without the One Dear Lord, all wander around aimlessly.<BR>
 Their minds are imbued with attachment to family, and so they continually wander around, puffed up with pride.<BR>
 The arrogant wander around the world; why are they so proud of their wealth?<BR>
 Their wealth shall not go with them when they depart; in an instant, it is gone.<BR>
 They wander around in the world, according to the Hukam of the Lord's Command.<BR>
 When one's karma is activated, one finds the Guru, and through Him, the Lord and Master is found.<BR>
 That humble being, who serves the Lord, has his affairs resolved by the Lord. ||14||<BR>
 Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 All speak with their mouths, but rare are those one who realize death.<BR>
 Nanak is the dust of the feet of those who have faith in the One Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Know that He dwells within all; rare are those who realize this.<BR>
 There is no obscuring veil on the body of that one, O Nanak, who meets the Guru. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I drink in the water which has washed the feet of those who share the Teachings.<BR>
 My body is filled with infinite love to see my True Master. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Fearless Lord, he becomes attached to Maya.<BR>
 He comes and goes, and wanders, dancing in countless incarnations.<BR>
 He gives his word, but then backs out. All that he says is false.<BR>
 The false person is hollow within; he is totally engrossed in falsehood.<BR>
 He tries to take vengeance upon the Lord, who bears no vengeance; such a person is trapped by falsehood and greed.<BR>
 The True King, the Primal Lord God, kills him when He sees what he has done.<BR>
 The Messenger of Death sees him, and he rots away in pain.<BR>
 Even-handed justice is administered, O Nanak, in the Court of the True Lord. ||15||<BR>
 Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 In the early hours of the morning, chant the Name of God, and meditate on the Feet of the Guru.<BR>
 The filth of birth and death is erased, singing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The body is dark, blind and empty, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 O Nanak, fruitful is the birth of one, within whose heart the True Master dwells. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 With my eyes, I have seen the Light; my great thirst for Him is not quenched.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 112</H2></CENTER>
 O Nanak, these are not the eyes which can see my Beloved Husband Lord. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 That humble being, who, as Gurmukh, serves the Lord, obtains all peace and pleasure.<BR>
 He Himself is saved, along with his family, and all the world is saved as well.<BR>
 He collects the wealth of the Lord's Name, and all his thirst is quenched.<BR>
 He renounces worldly greed, and his inner being is lovingly attuned to the Lord.<BR>
 Forever and ever, the home of his heart is filled with bliss; the Lord is his companion, help and support.<BR>
 He looks alike upon enemy and friend, and wishes well to all.<BR>
 He alone is fulfilled in this world, who meditates on the spiritual wisdom of the Guru.<BR>
 He obtains what is pre-ordained for him, according to the Lord. ||16||<BR>
 Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The true person is said to be beautiful; false is the reputation of the false.<BR>
 O Nanak, rare are those who have Truth in their laps. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The face of my friend, the Lord, is incomparably beautiful; I would watch Him, twenty-four hours a day.<BR>
 In sleep, I saw my Husband Lord; I am a sacrifice to that dream. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 O my friend, realize the True Lord. Just to talk about Him is useless.<BR>
 See Him within your mind; your Beloved is not far away. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The earth, the Akaashic ethers of the sky, the nether regions of the underworld, the moon and the sun shall pass away.<BR>
 Emperors, bankers, rulers and leaders shall depart, and their homes shall be demolished.<BR>
 The poor and the rich, the humble and the intoxicated, all these people shall pass away.<BR>
 The Qazis, Shaykhs and preachers shall all arise and depart.<BR>
 The spiritual teachers, prophets and disciples - none of these shall remain permanently.<BR>
 Fasts, calls to prayer and sacred scriptures - without understanding, all these shall vanish.<BR>
 The 8.4 million species of beings of the earth shall all continue coming and going in reincarnation.<BR>
 The One True Lord God is eternal and unchanging. The Lord's slave is also eternal. ||17||<BR>
 Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I have seen and examined all; without the One Lord, there is none at all.<BR>
 Come, and show me Your face, O my friend, so that my body and mind may be cooled and soothed. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The lover is without hope, but within my mind, there is great hope.<BR>
 In the midst of hope, only You, O Lord, remain free of hope; I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Even if I just hear of separation from You, I am in pain; without seeing You, O Lord, I die.<BR>
 Without her Beloved, the separated lover takes no comfort. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 River-banks, sacred shrines, idols, temples, and places of pilgrimage like Kaydarnaat'h, Mat'huraa and Benares,<BR>
 the three hundred thirty million gods, along with Indra, shall all pass away.<BR>
 The Simritees, Shaastras, the four Vedas and the six systems of philosophy shall vanish.<BR>
 Prayer books, Pandits, religious scholars, songs, poems and poets shall also depart.<BR>
 Those who are celibate, truthful and charitiable, and the Sannyaasee hermits are all subject to death.<BR>
 The silent sages, the Yogis and the nudists, along with the Messengers of Death, shall pass away.<BR>
 Whatever is seen shall perish; all will dissolve and disappear.<BR>
 Only the Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord, is permanent. His servant becomes permanent as well. ||18||<BR>
 Shalok Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Hundreds of times naked does not make the person naked; tens of thousands of hungers do not make him hungry;<BR>
 millions of pains do not cause him pain. O Nanak, the Husband Lord blesses him with his Glance of Grace. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 113</H2></CENTER>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Even if one were to enjoy all pleasures, and be master of the entire earth,<BR>
 O Nanak, all of that is just a disease. Without the Naam, he is dead. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Yearn for the One Lord, and make Him your friend.<BR>
 O Nanak, He alone fulfills your hopes; you should feel embarrassed, visiting other places. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The One and only Lord is eternal, imperishable, inaccessible and incomprehensible.<BR>
 The treasure of the Naam is eternal and imperishable. Meditating in remembrance on Him, the Lord is attained.<BR>
 The Kirtan of His Praises is eternal and imperishable; the Gurmukh sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 Truth, righteousness, Dharma and intense meditation are eternal and imperishable. Day and night, worship the Lord in adoration.<BR>
 Compassion, righteousness, Dharma and intense meditation are eternal and imperishable; they alone obtain these, who have such pre-ordained destiny.<BR>
 The inscription inscribed upon one's forehead is eternal and imperishable; it cannot be avoided by avoidance.<BR>
 The Congregation, the Company of the Holy, and the word of the humble, are eternal and imperishable. The Holy Guru is eternal and imperishable.<BR>
 Those who have such pre-ordained destiny worship and adore the Lord, forever and ever. ||19||<BR>
 Shalok, Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One who himself has drowned - how can he carry anyone else across?<BR>
 One who is imbued with the Love of the Husband Lord - O Nanak, he himself is saved, and he saves others as well. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Wherever someone speaks and hears the Name of my Beloved Lord,<BR>
 that is where I go, O Nanak, to see Him, and blossom forth in bliss. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 You are in love with your children and your wife; why do you keep calling them your own?<BR>
 O Nanak, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the human body has no foundation. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 With my eyes, I gaze upon the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan; I touch my forehead to the Guru's feet.<BR>
 With my feet I walk on the Guru's Path; with my hands, I wave the fan over Him.<BR>
 I meditate on Akaal Moorat, the undying form, within my heart; day and night, I meditate on Him.<BR>
 I have renounced all possessiveness, and have placed my faith in the all-powerful Guru.<BR>
 The Guru has blessed me with the treasure of the Naam; I am rid of all sufferings.<BR>
 Eat and enjoy the Naam, the Name of the indescribable Lord, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 Confirm your faith in the Naam, charity and self-purification; chant the Guru's sermon forever.<BR>
 Blessed with intuitive poise, I have found God; I am rid of the fear of the Messenger of Death. ||20||<BR>
 Shalok, Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I am centered and focused on my Beloved, but I am not satisfied, even by seeing Him.<BR>
 The Lord and Master is within all; I do not see any other. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The sayings of the Saints are the paths of peace.<BR>
 O Nanak, they alone obtain them, upon whose foreheads such destiny is written. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 He is totally permeating the mountains, oceans, deserts, lands, forests, orchards, caves,<BR>
 the nether regions of the underworld, the Akaashic ethers of the skies, and all hearts.<BR>
 Nanak sees that they are all strung on the same thread. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The Dear Lord is my mother, the Dear Lord is my father; the Dear Lord cherishes and nurtures me.<BR>
 The Dear Lord takes care of me; I am the child of the Lord.<BR>
 Slowly and steadily, He feeds me; He never fails.<BR>
 He does not remind me of my faults; He hugs me close in His embrace.<BR>
 Whatever I ask for, He give me; the Lord is my peace-giving father.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 114</H2></CENTER>
 He has blessed me with the capital, the wealth of spiritual wisdom; He has made me worthy of this merchandise.<BR>
 He has made me a partner with the Guru; I have obtained all peace and comforts.<BR>
 He is with me, and shall never separate from me; the Lord, my father, is potent to do everything. ||21||<BR>
 Shalok, Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 O Nanak, break away from the false, and seek out the Saints, your true friends.<BR>
 The false shall leave you, even while you are still alive; but the Saints shall not forsake you, even when you are dead. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 O Nanak, the lightning flashes, and thunder echoes in the dark black clouds.<BR>
 The downpour from the clouds is heavy; O Nanak, the soul-brides are exalted and embellished with their Beloved. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The ponds and the lands are overflowing with water, and the cold wind is blowing.<BR>
 Her bed is adorned with gold, diamonds and rubies;<BR>
 she is blessed with beautiful gowns and delicacies, O Nanak, but without her Beloved, she burns in agony. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 He does the dees which the Creator causes him to do.<BR>
 Even if you run in hundreds of directions, O mortal, you shall still receive what you are pre-destined to receive.<BR>
 Without good karma, you shall obtain nothing, even if you wander across the whole world.<BR>
 Meeting with the Guru, you shall know the Fear of God, and other fears shall be taken away.<BR>
 Through the Fear of God, the attitude of detachment wells up, and one sets out in search of the Lord.<BR>
 Searching and searching, intuitive wisdom wells up, and then, one is not born to die again.<BR>
 Practicing meditation within my heart, I have found the Sanctuary of the Holy.<BR>
 Whoever the Lord places on the boat of Guru Nanak, is carried across the terrifying world-ocean. ||22||<BR>
 Shalok, Dakhanay Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 First, accept death, and give up any hope of life.<BR>
 Become the dust of the feet of all, and then, you may come to me. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 See, that only one who has died, truly lives; one who is alive, consider him dead.<BR>
 Those who are in love with the One Lord, are the supreme people. ||2||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Pain does not even approach that person, within whose mind God abides.<BR>
 Hunger and thirst do not affect him, and the Messenger of Death does not approach him. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Your worth cannot be estimated, O True, Unmoving Lord God.<BR>
 The Siddhas, seekers, spiritual teachers and meditators - who among them can measure You?<BR>
 You are all-powerful, to form and break; You create and destroy all.<BR>
 You are all-powerful to act, and inspire all to act; You speak through each and every heart.<BR>
 You give sustanance to all; why should mankind waver?<BR>
 You are deep, profound and unfathomable; Your virtuous spiritual wisdom is priceless.<BR>
 They do the deeds which they are pre-ordained to do.<BR>
 Without You, there is nothing at all; Nanak chants Your Glorious Praises. ||23||1||2||<BR>
 Raag Maaroo, The Word Of Kabeer Jee:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 O Pandit, O religious scholar, in what foul thoughts are you engaged?<BR>
 You shall be drowned, along with your family, if you do not meditate on the Lord, you unfortunate person. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 What is the use of reading the Vedas and the Puraanas? It is like loading a donkey with sandalwood.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 115</H2></CENTER>
 You do not know the exalted state of the Lord's Name; how will you ever cross over? ||1||<BR>
 You kill living beings, and call it a righteous action. Tell me, brother, what would you call an unrighteous action?<BR>
 You call yourself the most excellent sage; then who would you call a butcher? ||2||<BR>
 You are blind in your mind, and do not understand your own self; how can you make others understand, O brother?<BR>
 For the sake of Maya and money, you sell knowledge; your life is totally worthless. ||3||<BR>
 Naarad and Vyaasa say these things; go and ask Suk Dayv as well.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, chanting the Lord's Name, you shall be saved; otherwise, you shall drown, brother. ||4||1||<BR>
 Living in the forest, how will you find Him? Not until you remove corruption from your mind.<BR>
 Those who look alike upon home and forest, are the most perfect people in the world. ||1||<BR>
 You shall find real peace in the Lord,<BR>
 if you lovingly dwell on the Lord within your being. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 What is the use of wearing matted hair, smearing the body with ashes, and living in a cave?<BR>
 Conquering the mind, one conquers the world, and then remains detached from corruption. ||2||<BR>
 They all apply make-up to their eyes; there is little difference between their objectives.<BR>
 But those eyes, to which the ointment of spiritual wisdom is applied, are approved and supreme. ||3||<BR>
 Says Kabeer, now I know my Lord; the Guru has blessed me with spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 I have met the Lord, and I am emancipated within; now, my mind does not wander at all. ||4||2||<BR>
 You have riches and miraculous spiritual powers; so what business do you have with anyone else?<BR>
 What should I say about the reality of your talk? I am embarrassed even to speak to you. ||1||<BR>
 One who has found the Lord,<BR>
 does not wander from door to door. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The false world wanders all around, in hopes of finding wealth to use for a few days.<BR>
 That humble being, who drinks in the Lord's water, never becomes thirsty again. ||2||<BR>
 Whoever understands, by Guru's Grace, becomes free of hope in the midst of hope.<BR>
 One comes to see the Lord everywhere, when the soul becomes detached. ||3||<BR>
 I have tasted the sublime essence of the Lord's Name; the Lord's Name carries everyone across.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, I have become like gold; doubt is dispelled, and I have crossed over the world-ocean. ||4||3||<BR>
 Like drops of water in the water of the ocean, and like waves in the stream, I merge in the Lord.<BR>
 Merging my being into the Absolute Being of God, I have become impartial and transparent, like the air. ||1||<BR>
 Why should I come into the world again?<BR>
 Coming and going is by the Hukam of His Command; realizing His Hukam, I shall merge in Him. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 When the body, formed of the five elements, perishes, then any such doubts shall end.<BR>
 Giving up the different schools of philosophy, I look upon all equally; I meditate only on the One Name. ||2||<BR>
 Whatever I am attached to, to that I am attached; such are the deeds I do.<BR>
 When the Dear Lord grants His Grace, then I am merged in the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||3||<BR>
 Die while yet alive, and by so dying, be alive; thus you shall not be reborn again.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 116</H2></CENTER>
 Says Kabeer, whoever is absorbed in the Naam remains lovingly absorbed in the Primal, Absolute Lord. ||4||4||<BR>
 If You keep me far away from You, then tell me, what is liberation?<BR>
 The One has many forms, and is contained within all; how can I be fooled now? ||1||<BR>
 O Lord, where will You take me, to save me?<BR>
 Tell me where, and what sort of liberation shall You give me? By Your Grace, I have already obtained it. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 People talk of salvation and being saved, as long as they do not understand the essence of reality.<BR>
 I have now become pure within my heart, says Kabeer, and my mind is pleased and appeased. ||2||5||<BR>
 Raawan made castles and fortresses of gold, but he had to abandon them when he left. ||1||<BR>
 Why do you act only to please your mind?<BR>
 When Death comes and grabs you by the hair, then only the Name of the Lord will save you. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Death, and deathlessness are the creations of our Lord and Master; this show, this expanse, is only an entanglement.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, those who have the sublime essence of the Lord in their hearts - in the end, they are liberated. ||2||6||<BR>
 The body is a village, and the soul is the owner and farmer; the five farm-hands live there.<BR>
 The eyes, nose, ears, tongue and sensory organs of touch do not obey any order. ||1||<BR>
 O father, now I shall not live in this village.<BR>
 The accountants summoned Chitar and Gupat, the recording scribes of the conscious and the unconscious, to ask for an account of each and every moment. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 When the Righteous Judge of Dharma calls for my account, there shall be a very heavy balance against me.<BR>
 The five farm-hands shall then run away, and the bailiff shall arrest the soul. ||2||<BR>
 Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints: settle your accounts in this farm.<BR>
 O Lord, please forgive Your slave now, in this life, so that he may not have to return again to this terrifying world-ocean. ||3||7||<BR>
 Raag Maaroo, The Word Of Kabeer Jee:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 No one has seen the Fearless Lord, O renunciate.<BR>
 Without the Fear of God, how can the Fearless Lord be obtained? ||1||<BR>
 If one sees the Presence of his Husband Lord near at hand, then he feels the Fear of God, O renunciate.<BR>
 If he realizes the Hukam of the Lord's Command, then he becomes fearless. ||2||<BR>
 Don't practice hypocrisy with the Lord, O renunciate!<BR>
 The whole world is filled with hypocrisy. ||3||<BR>
 Thirst and desire do not just go away, O renunciate.<BR>
 The body is burning in the fire of worldly love and attachment. ||4||<BR>
 Anxiety is burned, and the body is burned, O renunciate,<BR>
 only if one lets his mind become dead. ||5||<BR>
 Without the True Guru, there can be no renunciation,<BR>
 even though all the people may wish for it. ||6||<BR>
 When God grants His Grace, one meets the True Guru, O renunciate,<BR>
 and automatically, intuitively finds that Lord. ||7||<BR>
 Says Kabeer, I offer this one prayer, O renunciate.<BR>
 Carry me across the terrifying world-ocean. ||8||1||8||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 117</H2></CENTER>
 O king, who will come to you?<BR>
 I have seen such love from Bidur, that the poor man is pleasing to me. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Gazing upon your elephants, you have gone astray in doubt; you do not know the Great Lord God.<BR>
 I judge Bidur's water to be like ambrosial nectar, in comparison with your milk. ||1||<BR>
 I find his rough vegetables to be like rice pudding; the night of my life passes singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<BR>
 Kabeer's Lord and Master is joyous and blissful; He does not care about anyone's social class. ||2||9||<BR>
 Shalok, Kabeer:<BR>
 The battle-drum beats in the sky of the mind; aim is taken, and the wound is inflicted.<BR>
 The spiritual warriors enter the field of battle; now is the time to fight! ||1||<BR>
 He alone is known as a spiritual hero, who fights in defense of religion.<BR>
 He may be cut apart, piece by piece, but he never leaves the field of battle. ||2||2||<BR>
 Shabad Of Kabeer, Raag Maaroo, The Word Of Naam Dayv Jee:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 I have obtained the four kinds of liberation, and the four miraculous spiritual powers, in the Sanctuary of God, my Husband Lord.<BR>
 I am liberated, and famous throughout the four ages; the canopy of praise and fame waves over my head. ||1||<BR>
 Meditating on the Sovereign Lord God, who has not been saved?<BR>
 Whoever follows the Guru's Teachings and joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is called the most devoted of the devotees. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He is adorned with the conch, the chakra, the mala and the ceremonial tilak mark on his forehead; gazing upon his radiant glory, the Messenger of Death is scared away.<BR>
 He becomes fearless, and the power of the Lord thunders through him; the pains of birth and death are taken away. ||2||<BR>
 The Lord blessed Ambreek with fearless dignity, and elevated Bhabhikhan to become king.<BR>
 Sudama's Lord and Master blessed him with the nine treasures; he made Dhroo permanent and unmoving; as the north star, he still hasn't moved. ||3||<BR>
 For the sake of His devotee Prahlaad, God assumed the form of the man-lion, and killed Harnaakhash.<BR>
 Says Naam Dayv, the beautiful-haired Lord is in the power of His devotees; He is standing at Balraja's door, even now! ||4||1||<BR>
 Maaroo, Kabeer Jee:<BR>
 You have forgotten your religion, O madman; you have forgotten your religion.<BR>
 You fill your belly, and sleep like an animal; you have wasted and lost this human life. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You never joined the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. You are engrossed in false pursuits.<BR>
 You wander like a dog, a pig, a crow; soon, you shall have to get up and leave. ||1||<BR>
 You believe that you yourself are great, and that others are small.<BR>
 Those who are false in thought, word and deed, I have seen them going to hell. ||2||<BR>
 The lustful, the angry, the clever, the deceitful and the lazy<BR>
 waste their lives in slander, and never remember their Lord in meditation. ||3||<BR>
 Says Kabeer, the fools, the idiots and the brutes do not remember the Lord.<BR>
 They do not know the Lord's Name; how can they be carried across? ||4||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 25 - Raag Maaroo - Part 118</H2></CENTER>
 Raag Maaroo, The Word Of Jai Dayv Jee:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The breath is drawn in through the left nostril; it is held in the central channel of the Sushmanaa, and exhaled through the right nostril, repeating the Lord's Name sixteen times.<BR>
 I am powerless; my power has been broken. My unstable mind has been stabliized, and my unadorned soul has been adorned. I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||1||<BR>
 Within my mind, I chant the Name of the Primal Lord God, the Source of virtue.<BR>
 My vision, that You are I are separate, has melted away. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I worship the One who is worthy of being worshipped. I trust the One who is worthy of being trusted. Like water merging in water, I merge in the Lord.<BR>
 Says Jai Dayv, I meditate and contemplate the Luminous, Triumphant Lord. I am lovingly absorbed in the Nirvaanaa of God. ||2||1||<BR>
 Kabeer, Maaroo:<BR>
 Meditate in remembrance on the Lord, or else you will regret it in the end, O mind.<BR>
 O sinful soul, you act in greed, but today or tomorrow, you will have to get up and leave. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Clinging to greed, you have wasted your life, deluded in the doubt of Maya.<BR>
 Do not take pride in your wealth and youth; you shall crumble apart like dry paper. ||1||<BR>
 When the Messenger of Death comes and grabs you by the hair, and knocks you down, on that day, you shall be powerless.<BR>
 You do not remember the Lord, or vibrate upon Him in meditation, and you do not practice compassion; you shall be beaten on your face. ||2||<BR>
 When the Righteous Judge of Dharma calls for your account, what face will you show Him then?<BR>
 Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints: in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you shall be saved. ||3||1||<BR>
 Raag Maaroo, The Word Of Ravi Daas Jee:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 O Love, who else but You could do such a thing?<BR>
 O Patron of the poor, Lord of the World, You have put the canopy of Your Grace over my head. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Only You can grant Mercy to that person whose touch pollutes the world.<BR>
 You exalt and elevate the lowly, O my Lord of the Universe; You are not afraid of anyone. ||1||<BR>
 Naam Dayv, Kabeer, Trilochan, Sadhana and Sain crossed over.<BR>
 Says Ravi Daas, listen, O Saints, through the Dear Lord, all is accomplished. ||2||1||<BR>
 MAAROO:<BR>
 The Lord is the ocean of peace; the miraculous tree of life, the jewel of miracles and the wish-fulfilling cow are all under His power.<BR>
 The four great blessings, the eight great miraculous spiritual powers and the nine treasures are in the palm of His hand. ||1||<BR>
 Why don't you chant the Lord's Name, Har, Har, Har?<BR>
 Abandon all other devices of words. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The many epics, the Puraanas and the Vedas are all composed out of the letters of the alphabet.<BR>
 After careful thought, Vyaasa spoke the supreme truth, that there is nothing equal to the Lord's Name. ||2||<BR>
 In intuitive Samaadhi, their troubles are eliminated; the very fortunate ones lovingly focus on the Lord.<BR>
 Says Ravi Daas, the Lord's slave remains detached from the world; the fear of birth and death runs away from his mind. ||3||2||15||<BR>
