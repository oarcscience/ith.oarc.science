<HR><CENTER><H1>Shri Guru Granth Sahib: Raag Raamkalee</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 001</H2></CENTER>
 Raamkalee, First Mehl, First House, Chau-Padas:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<BR>
 Some read the Sanskrit scriptures, and some read the Puraanas.<BR>
 Some meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and chant it on their malas, focusing on it in meditation.<BR>
 I know nothing, now or ever; I recognize only Your One Name, Lord. ||1||<BR>
 I do not know, Lord, what my condition shall be.<BR>
 I am foolish and ignorant; I seek Your Sanctuary, God. Please, save my honor and my self-respect. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Sometimes, the soul soars high in the heavens, and sometimes it falls to the depths of the nether regions.<BR>
 The greedy soul does not remain stable; it searches in the four directions. ||2||<BR>
 With death pre-ordained, the soul comes into the world, gathering the riches of life.<BR>
 I see that some have already gone, O my Lord and Master; the burning fire is coming closer! ||3||<BR>
 No one has any friend, and no one has any brother; no one has any father or mother.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, if You bless me with Your Name, it shall be my help and support in the end. ||4||1||<BR>
 Raamkalee, First Mehl:<BR>
 Your Light is prevailing everywhere.<BR>
 Wherever I look, there I see the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Please rid me of the desire to live, O my Lord and Master.<BR>
 My mind is entangled in the deep dark pit of Maya. How can I cross over, O Lord and Master? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He dwells deep within, inside the heart; how can He not be outside as well?<BR>
 Our Lord and Master always takes care of us, and keeps us in His thoughts. ||2||<BR>
 He Himself is near at hand, and He is far away.<BR>
 He Himself is all-pervading, permeating everywhere.<BR>
 Meeting the True Guru, the darkness is dispelled.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 002</H2></CENTER>
 Wherever I look, there I see Him pervading. ||3||<BR>
 There is doubt within me, and Maya is outside; it hits me in the eyes like an arrow.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, the slave of the Lord's slaves: such a mortal suffers terribly. ||4||2||<BR>
 Raamkalee, First Mehl:<BR>
 Where is that door, where You live, O Lord? What is that door called? Among all doors, who can find that door?<BR>
 For the sake of that door, I wander around sadly, detached from the world; if only someone would come and tell me about that door. ||1||<BR>
 How can I cross over the world-ocean?<BR>
 While I am living, I cannot be dead. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Pain is the door, and anger is the guard; hope and anxiety are the two shutters.<BR>
 Maya is the water in the moat; in the middle of this moat, he has built his home. The Primal Lord sits in the Seat of Truth. ||2||<BR>
 You have so many Names, Lord, I do not know their limit. There is no other equal to You.<BR>
 Do not speak out loud - remain in your mind. The Lord Himself knows, and He Himself acts. ||3||<BR>
 As long as there is hope, there is anxiety; so how can anyone speak of the One Lord?<BR>
 In the midst of hope, remain untouched by hope; then, O Nanak, you shall meet the One Lord. ||4||<BR>
 In this way, you shall cross over the world-ocean.<BR>
 This is the way to remain dead while yet alive. ||1||Second Pause||3||<BR>
 Raamkalee, First Mehl:<BR>
 Awareness of the Shabad and the Teachings is my horn; the people hear the sound of its vibrations.<BR>
 Honor is my begging-bowl, and the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the charity I receive. ||1||<BR>
 O Baba, Gorakh is the Lord of the Universe; He is always awake and aware.<BR>
 He alone is Gorakh, who sustains the earth; He created it in an instant. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Binding together water and air, He infused the breath of life into the body, and made the lamps of the sun and the moon.<BR>
 To die and to live, He gave us the earth, but we have forgotten these blessings. ||2||<BR>
 There are so many Siddhas, seekers, Yogis, wandering pilgrims, spiritual teachers and good people.<BR>
 If I meet them, I chant the Lord's Praises, and then, my mind serves Him. ||3||<BR>
 Paper and salt, protected by ghee, remain untouched by water, as the lotus remains unaffected in water.<BR>
 Those who meet with such devotees, O servant Nanak - what can death do to them? ||4||4||<BR>
 Raamkalee, First Mehl:<BR>
 Listen, Machhindra, to what Nanak says.<BR>
 One who subdues the five passions does not waver.<BR>
 One who practices Yoga in such a way,<BR>
 saves himself, and saves all his generations. ||1||<BR>
 He alone is a hermit, who attains such understanding.<BR>
 Day and night, he remains absorbed in deepest Samaadhi. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He begs for loving devotion to the Lord, and lives in the Fear of God.<BR>
 He is satisfied, with the priceless gift of contentment.<BR>
 Becoming the embodiment of meditation, he attains the true Yogic posture.<BR>
 He focuses his consciousness in the deep trance of the True Name. ||2||<BR>
 Nanak chants the Ambrosial Bani.<BR>
 Listen, O Machhindra: this is the insignia of the true hermit.<BR>
 One who, in the midst of hope, remains untouched by hope,<BR>
 shall truly find the Creator Lord. ||3||<BR>
 Prays Nanak, I share the mysterious secrets of God.<BR>
 The Guru and His disciple are joined together!<BR>
 One who eats this food, this medicine of the Teachings,<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 003</H2></CENTER>
 has the wisdom of the six Shaastras. ||4||5||<BR>
 Raamkalee, First Mehl:<BR>
 My boat is wobbly and unsteady; it is filled with sins. The wind is rising - what if it tips over?<BR>
 As sunmukh, I have turned to the Guru; O my Perfect Master; please be sure to bless me with Your glorious greatness. ||1||<BR>
 O Guru, my Saving Grace, please carry me across the world-ocean.<BR>
 Bless me with devotion to the perfect, imperishable Lord God; I am a sacrifice to You. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He alone is a Siddha, a seeker, a Yogi, a wandering pilgrim, who meditates on the One Perfect Lord.<BR>
 Touching the feet of the Lord Master, they are emancipated; they come to receive the Word of the Teachings. ||2||<BR>
 I know nothing of charity, meditation, self-discipline or religious rituals; I only chant Your Name, God.<BR>
 Nanak has met the Guru, the Transcendent Lord God; through the True Word of His Shabad, he is set free. ||3||6||<BR>
 Raamkalee, First Mehl:<BR>
 Focus your consciousness in deep absorption on the Lord.<BR>
 Make your body a raft, to cross over.<BR>
 Deep within is the fire of desire; keep it in check.<BR>
 Day and night, that lamp shall burn unceasingly. ||1||<BR>
 Float such a lamp upon the water;<BR>
 this lamp will bring total understanding. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 This understanding is good clay;<BR>
 a lamp made of such clay is acceptable to the Lord.<BR>
 So shape this lamp on the wheel of good actions.<BR>
 In this world and in the next, this lamp shall be with you. ||2||<BR>
 When He Himself grants His Grace,<BR>
 then, as Gurmukh, one may understand Him.<BR>
 Within the heart, this lamp is permanently lit.<BR>
 It is not extinguished by water or wind.<BR>
 Such a lamp will carry you across the water. ||3||<BR>
 Wind does not shake it, or put it out.<BR>
 Its light reveals the Divine Throne.<BR>
 The Kh'shaatriyas, Brahmins, Soodras and Vaishyas<BR>
 cannot find its value, even by thousands of calculations.<BR>
 If any of them lights such a lamp,<BR>
 O Nanak, he is emancipated. ||4||7||<BR>
 Raamkalee, First Mehl:<BR>
 To place one's faith in Your Name, Lord, is true worship.<BR>
 With an offering of Truth, one obtains a place to sit.<BR>
 If a prayer is offered with truth and contentment,<BR>
 the Lord will hear it, and call him in to sit by Him. ||1||<BR>
 O Nanak, no one returns empty-handed;<BR>
 such is the Court of the True Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The treasure I seek is the gift of Your Grace.<BR>
 Please bless this humble beggar - this is what I seek.<BR>
 Please, pour Your Love into the cup of my heart.<BR>
 This is Your pre-determined value. ||2||<BR>
 The One who created everything, does everything.<BR>
 He Himself appraises His own value.<BR>
 The Sovereign Lord King becomes manifest to the Gurmukh.<BR>
 He does not come, and He does not go. ||3||<BR>
 People curse at the beggar; by begging, he does not receive honor.<BR>
 O Lord, You inspire me to speak Your Words, and tell the Story of Your Court. ||4||8||<BR>
 Raamkalee, First Mehl:<BR>
 The drop is in the ocean, and the ocean is in the drop. Who understands, and knows this?<BR>
 He Himself creates the wondrous play of the world. He Himself contemplates it, and understands its true essence. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 004</H2></CENTER>
 How rare are those who contemplate this spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 Through this, the supreme state of liberation is attained. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The night is in the day, and the day is in the night. The same is true of hot and cold.<BR>
 No one else knows His state and extent; without the Guru, this is not understood. ||2||<BR>
 The female is in the male, and the male is in the female. Understand this, O God-realized being!<BR>
 The meditation is in the music, and knowledge is in meditation. Become Gurmukh, and speak the Unspoken Speech. ||3||<BR>
 The Light is in the mind, and the mind is in the Light. The Guru brings the five senses together, like brothers.<BR>
 Nanak is forever a sacrifice to those who enshrine love for the One Word of the Shabad. ||4||9||<BR>
 Raamkalee, First Mehl:<BR>
 When the Lord God showered His Mercy,<BR>
 egotism was eradicated from within me.<BR>
 That humble servant who contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad, is very dear to the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 That humble servant of the Lord is pleasing to his Lord God;<BR>
 day and night, he performs devotional worship, day and night. Disregarding his own honor, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The unstruck melody of the sound current resonates and resounds;<BR>
 my mind is appeased by the subtle essence of the Lord.<BR>
 Through the Perfect Guru, I am absorbed in Truth.<BR>
 Through the Guru, I have found the Lord, the Primal Being. ||2||<BR>
 Gurbani is the sound current of the Naad, the Vedas, everything.<BR>
 My mind is attuned to the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 He is my sacred shrine of pilgrimage, fasting and austere self-discipline.<BR>
 The Lord saves, and carries across, those who meet with the Guru. ||3||<BR>
 One whose self-conceit is gone, sees his fears run away.<BR>
 That servant grasps the Guru's feet.<BR>
 The Guru, the True Guru, has expelled my doubts.<BR>
 Says Nanak, I have merged into the Word of the Shabad. ||4||10||<BR>
 Raamkalee, First Mehl:<BR>
 He runs around, begging for clothes and food.<BR>
 He burns with hunger and corruption, and will suffer in the world hereafter.<BR>
 He does not follow the Guru's Teachings; through his evil-mindedness, he loses his honor.<BR>
 Only through the Guru's Teachings will such a person become devoted. ||1||<BR>
 The way of the Yogi is to dwell in the celestial home of bliss.<BR>
 He looks impartially, equally upon all. He receives the charity of the Lord's Love, and the Word of the Shabad, and so he is satisfied. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The five bulls, the senses, pull the wagon of the body around.<BR>
 By the Lord's power, one's honor is preserved.<BR>
 But when the axle breaks, the wagon falls and crashes.<BR>
 It falls apart, like a pile of logs. ||2||<BR>
 Contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad, Yogi.<BR>
 Look upon pain and pleasure as one and the same, sorrow and separation.<BR>
 Let your food be contemplative meditation upon the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 Your wall shall be permanent, by meditating on the Formless Lord. ||3||<BR>
 Wear the loin-cloth of poise, and be free of entanglements.<BR>
 The Guru's Word shall release you from sexual desire and anger.<BR>
 In your mind, let your ear-rings be the Sanctuary of the Guru, the Lord.<BR>
 O Nanak, worshipping the Lord in deep devotion, the humble are carried across. ||4||11||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 005</H2></CENTER>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Raamkalee, Third Mehl, First House:<BR>
 In the Golden Age of Sat Yuga, everyone spoke the Truth.<BR>
 In each and every home, devotional worship was performed by the people, according to the Guru's Teachings.<BR>
 In that Golden Age, Dharma had four feet.<BR>
 How rare are those people who, as Gurmukh, contemplate this and understand. ||1||<BR>
 In all four ages, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is glory and greatness.<BR>
 One who holds tight to the Naam is liberated; without the Guru, no one obtains the Naam. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 In the Silver Age of Traytaa Yuga, one leg was removed.<BR>
 Hypocrisy became prevalent, and people thought that the Lord was far away.<BR>
 The Gurmukhs still understood and realized;<BR>
 the Naam abided deep within them, and they were at peace. ||2||<BR>
 In the Brass Age of Dwaapur Yuga, duality and double-mindedness arose.<BR>
 Deluded by doubt, they knew duality.<BR>
 In this Brass Age, Dharma was left with only two feet.<BR>
 Those who became Gurmukh implanted the Naam deep within. ||3||<BR>
 In the Iron Age of Kali Yuga, Dharma was left with only one power.<BR>
 It walks on just one foot; love and emotional attachment to Maya have increased.<BR>
 Love and emotional attachment to Maya bring total darkness.<BR>
 If someone meets the True Guru, he is saved, through the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||<BR>
 Throughout the ages, there is only the One True Lord.<BR>
 Among all, is the True Lord; there is no other at all.<BR>
 Praising the True Lord, true peace is attained.<BR>
 How rare are those, who as Gurmukh, chant the Naam. ||5||<BR>
 Throughout all the ages, the Naam is the ultimate, the most sublime.<BR>
 How rare are those, who as Gurmukh, understand this.<BR>
 One who meditates on the Lord's Name is a humble devotee.<BR>
 O Nanak, in each and every age, the Naam is glory and greatness. ||6||1||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fourth Mehl, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 If someone is very fortunate, and is blessed with great high destiny, then he meditates on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he finds peace, and merges in the Naam. ||1||<BR>
 O mortal, as Gurmukh, worship the Lord in devotion forever.<BR>
 Your heart shall be illumined; through the Guru's Teachings, lovingly attune yourself to the Lord. You shall merge in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Great Giver is filled with diamonds, emeralds, rubies and pearls;<BR>
 one who has good fortune and great destiny inscribed upon his forehead, digs them out, by following the Guru's Teachings. ||2||<BR>
 The Lord's Name is the jewel, the emerald, the ruby; digging it out, the Guru has placed it in your palm.<BR>
 The unfortunate, self-willed manmukh does not obtain it; this priceless jewel remains hidden behind a curtain of straw. ||3||<BR>
 If such pre-ordained destiny is written upon one's forehead, then the True Guru enjoins him to serve Him.<BR>
 O Nanak, then he obtains the jewel, the gem; blessed, blessed is that one who follows the Guru's Teachings, and finds the Lord. ||4||1||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 Meeting with the humble servants of the Lord, I am in ecstasy; they preach the sublime sermon of the Lord.<BR>
 The filth of evil-mindedness is totally washed away; joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, one is blessed with understanding. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 006</H2></CENTER>
 O humble servant of the Lord, follow the Guru's Teachings, and chant the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Whoever hears and speaks it is liberated; chanting the Lord's Name, one is embellished with beauty. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 If someone has supremely high destiny written on his forehead, the Lord leads him to meet the humble servants of the Lord.<BR>
 Be merciful, and grant me the Blessed Vision of the Saints' Darshan, which shall rid me of all poverty and pain. ||2||<BR>
 The Lord's people are good and sublime; the unfortunate ones do not like them at all.<BR>
 The more the Lord's exalted servants speak of Him, the more the slanderers attack and sting them. ||3||<BR>
 Cursed, cursed are the slanderers who do not like the humble, the friends and companions of the Lord.<BR>
 Those who do not like the honor and glory of the Guru are faithless, black-faced thieves, who have turned their backs on the Lord. ||4||<BR>
 Have mercy, have mercy, please save me, Dear Lord. I am meek and humble - I seek Your protection.<BR>
 I am Your child, and You are my father, God. Please forgive servant Nanak and merge him with Yourself. ||5||2||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 The friends of the Lord, the humble, Holy Saints are sublime; the Lord spreads out His protecting hands above them.<BR>
 The Gurmukhs are the Holy Saints, pleasing to God; in His mercy, He blends them with Himself. ||1||<BR>
 O Lord, my mind longs to meet with the humble servants of the Lord.<BR>
 The sweet, subtle essence of the Lord is immortalizing ambrosia. Meeting the Saints, I drink it in. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Lord's people are the most lofty and exalted. Meeting with them, the most exalted status is obtained.<BR>
 I am the slave of the slave of the Lord's slaves; my Lord and Master is pleased with me. ||2||<BR>
 The humble servant serves; one who enshrines love for the Lord in his heart, mind and body is very fortunate.<BR>
 One who talks too much without love, speaks falsely, and obtains only false rewards. ||3||<BR>
 Take pity on me, O Lord of the World, O Great Giver; let me fall at the feet of the Saints.<BR>
 I would cut off my head, and cut it into pieces, O Nanak, and set it down for the Saints to walk upon. ||4||3||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 If I am blessed with supreme high destiny, I will meet the humble servants of the Lord, without delay.<BR>
 The Lord's humble servants are pools of ambrosial nectar; by great good fortune, one bathes in them. ||1||<BR>
 O Lord, let me work for the humble servants of the Lord.<BR>
 I carry water, wave the fan and grind the corn for them; I massage and wash their feet. I apply the dust of their feet to my forehead. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Lord's humble servants are great, very great, the greatest and most exalted; they lead us to meet the True Guru.<BR>
 No one else is as great as the True Guru; meeting the True Guru, I meditate on the Lord, the Primal Being. ||2||<BR>
 Those who seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru find the Lord. My Lord and Master saves their honor.<BR>
 Some come for their own purposes, and sit before the Guru; they pretend to be in Samaadhi, like storks with their eyes closed. ||3||<BR>
 Associating with the wretched and the lowly, like the stork and the crow, is like feeding on a carcass of poison.<BR>
 Nanak: O God, unite me with the Sangat, the Congregation. United with the Sangat, I will become a swan. ||4||4||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 007</H2></CENTER>
 Raamkalee, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 O True Guru, please be kind, and unite me with the Lord. My Sovereign Lord is the Beloved of my breath of life.<BR>
 I am a slave; I fall at the Guru's feet. He has shown me the Path, the Way to my Lord God. ||1||<BR>
 The Name of my Lord, Har, Har, is pleasing to my mind.<BR>
 I have no friend except the Lord; the Lord is my father, my mother, my companion. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 My breath of life will not survive for an instant, without my Beloved; unless I see Him, I will die, O my mother!<BR>
 Blessed, blessed is my great, high destiny, that I have come to the Guru's Sanctuary. Meeting with the Guru, I have obtained the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||2||<BR>
 I do not know or understand any other within my mind; I meditate and chant the Lord's Chant.<BR>
 Those who lack the Naam, wander in shame; their noses are chopped off, bit by bit. ||3||<BR>
 O Life of the World, rejuvenate me! O my Lord and Master, enshrine Your Name deep within my heart.<BR>
 O Nanak, perfect is the Guru, the Guru. Meeting the True Guru, I meditate on the Naam. ||4||5||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 The True Guru, the Great Giver, is the Great, Primal Being; meeting Him, the Lord is enshrined within the heart.<BR>
 The Perfect Guru has granted me the life of the soul; I meditate in remembrance on the Ambrosial Name of the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O Lord, the Guru has implanted the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, within my heart.<BR>
 As Gurmukh, I have heard His sermon, which pleases my mind; blessed, blessed is my great destiny. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Millions, three hundred thirty millions of gods meditate on Him, but they cannot find His end or limitation.<BR>
 With sexual urges in their hearts, they beg for beautiful women; stretching out their hands, they beg for riches. ||2||<BR>
 One who chants the Praises of the Lord is the greatest of the great; the Gurmukh keeps the Lord clasped to his heart.<BR>
 If one is blessed with high destiny, he meditates on the Lord, who carries him across the terrifying world-ocean. ||3||<BR>
 The Lord is close to His humble servant, and His humble servant is close to the Lord; He keeps His humble servant clasped to His Heart.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Lord God is our father and mother. I am His child; the Lord cherishes me. ||4||6||18||<BR>
 Raag Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Have mercy on me, O Generous Giver, Lord of the meek; please do not consider my merits and demerits.<BR>
 How can dust be washed? O my Lord and Master, such is the state of mankind. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, serve the True Guru, and be at peace.<BR>
 Whatever you desire, you shall receive that reward, and you shall not be afflicted by pain any longer. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He creates and adorns the earthen vessels; He infuses His Light within them.<BR>
 As is the destiny pre-ordained by the Creator, so are the deeds we do. ||2||<BR>
 He believes the mind and body are all his own; this is the cause of his coming and going.<BR>
 He does not think of the One who gave him these; he is blind, entangled in emotional attachment. ||3||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 008</H2></CENTER>
 One who knows that God created him, reaches the Incomparable Mansion of the Lord's Presence.<BR>
 Worshipping the Lord, I sing His Glorious Praises. Nanak is Your slave. ||4||1||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Place yourself beneath all men's feet, and you will be uplifted; serve Him in this way.<BR>
 Know that all are above you, and you shall find peace in the Court of the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O Saints, speak that speech which purifies the gods and sanctifies the divine beings. As Gurmukh, chant the Word of His Bani, even for an instant. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Renounce your fraudulent plans, and dwell in the celestial palace; do not call anyone else false.<BR>
 Meeting with the True Guru, you shall receive the nine treasures; in this way, you shall find the essence of reality. ||2||<BR>
 Eradicate doubt, and as Gurmukh, enshrine love for the Lord; understand your own soul, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 Know that God is near at hand, and ever-present. How could you try to hurt anyone else? ||3||<BR>
 Meeting with the True Guru, your path shall be clear, and you shall easily meet your Lord and Master.<BR>
 Blessed, blessed are those humble beings, who, in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, find the Lord. Nanak is forever a sacrifice to them. ||4||2||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Coming does not please me, and going does not bring me pain, and so my mind is not afflicted by disease.<BR>
 I am in bliss forever, for I have found the Perfect Guru; my separation from the Lord is totally ended. ||1||<BR>
 This is how I have joined my mind to the Lord.<BR>
 Attachment, sorrow, disease and public opinion do not affect me, and so, I enjoy the subtle essence of the Lord, Har, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I am pure in the heavenly realm, pure on this earth, and pure in the nether regions of the underworld. I remain apart from the people of the world.<BR>
 Obedient to the Lord, I enjoy peace forever; wherever I look, I see the Lord of glorious virtues. ||2||<BR>
 There is no Shiva or Shakti, no energy or matter, no water or wind, no world of form there,<BR>
 where the True Guru, the Yogi, dwells, where the Imperishable Lord God, the Unapproachable Master abides. ||3||<BR>
 Body and mind belong to the Lord; all wealth belongs to the Lord; what glorious virtues of the Lord can I describe?<BR>
 Says Nanak, the Guru has destroyed my sense of 'mine and yours'. Like water with water, I am blended with God. ||4||3||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 It is beyond the three qualities; it remains untouched. The seekers and Siddhas do not know it.<BR>
 There is a chamber filled with jewels, overflowing with Ambrosial Nectar, in the Guru's Treasury. ||1||<BR>
 This thing is wonderful and amazing! It cannot be described.<BR>
 It is an unfathomable object, O Siblings of Destiny! ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Its value cannot be estimated at all; what can anyone say about it?<BR>
 By speaking and describing it, it cannot be understood; only one who sees it realizes it. ||2||<BR>
 Only the Creator Lord knows it; what can any poor creature do?<BR>
 Only He Himself knows His own state and extent. The Lord Himself is the treasure overflowing. ||3||<BR>
 Tasting such Ambrosial Nectar, the mind remains satisfied and satiated.<BR>
 Says Nanak, my hopes are fulfilled; I have found the Guru's Sanctuary. ||4||4||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 009</H2></CENTER>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 God has made me His own, and vanquished all my enemies.<BR>
 Those enemies who have plundered this world, have all been placed in bondage. ||1||<BR>
 The True Guru is my Transcendent Lord.<BR>
 I enjoy countless pleasures of power and tasty delights, chanting Your Name, and placing my faith in You. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I do not think of any other at all. The Lord is my protector, above my head.<BR>
 I am carefree and independent, when I have the Support of Your Name, O my Lord and Master. ||2||<BR>
 I have become perfect, meeting with the Giver of peace, and now, I lack nothing at all.<BR>
 I have obtained the essence of excellence, the supreme status; I shall not forsake it to go anywhere else. ||3||<BR>
 I cannot describe how You are, O True Lord, unseen, infinite,<BR>
 immeasurable, unfathomable and unmoving Lord. O Nanak, He is my Lord and Master. ||4||5||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 You are wise; You are eternal and unchanging. You are my social class and honor.<BR>
 You are unmoving - You never move at all. How can I be worried? ||1||<BR>
 You alone are the One and only Lord;<BR>
 You alone are the king.<BR>
 By Your Grace, I have found peace. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You are the ocean, and I am Your swan; the pearls and rubies are in You.<BR>
 You give, and You do not hesitate for an instant; I receive, forever enraptured. ||2||<BR>
 I am Your child, and You are my father; You place the milk in my mouth.<BR>
 I play with You, and You caress me in every way. You are forever the ocean of excellence. ||3||<BR>
 You are perfect, perfectly all-pervading; I am fulfilled with You as well.<BR>
 I am merged, merged, merged and remain merged; O Nanak, I cannot describe it! ||4||6||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Make your hands the cymbals, your eyes the tambourines, and your forehead the guitar you play.<BR>
 Let the sweet flute music resound in your ears, and with your tongue, vibrate this song.<BR>
 Move your mind like the rhythmic hand-motions; do the dance, and shake your ankle bracelets. ||1||<BR>
 This is the rhythmic dance of the Lord.<BR>
 The Merciful Audience, the Lord, sees all your make-up and decorations. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The whole earth is the stage, with the canopy of the sky overhead.<BR>
 The wind is the director; people are born of water.<BR>
 From the five elements, the puppet was created with its actions. ||2||<BR>
 The sun and the moon are the two lamps which shine, with the four corners of the world placed between them.<BR>
 The ten senses are the dancing girls, and the five passions are the chorus; they sit together within the one body.<BR>
 They all put on their own shows, and speak in different languages. ||3||<BR>
 In each and every home there is dancing, day and night; in each and every home, the bugles blow.<BR>
 Some are made to dance, and some are whirled around; some come and some go, and some are reduced to dust.<BR>
 Says Nanak, one who meets with the True Guru, does not have to dance the dance of reincarnation again. ||4||7||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 010</H2></CENTER>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 He sings the song of the One Universal Creator; he sings the tune of the One Lord.<BR>
 He lives in the land of the One Lord, shows the way to the One Lord, and remains attuned to the One Lord.<BR>
 He centers his consciousness on the One Lord, and serves only the One Lord, who is known through the Guru. ||1||<BR>
 Blessed and good is such a kirtanee, who sings such Praises.<BR>
 He sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord,<BR>
 and renounces the entanglements and pursuits of Maya. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He makes the five virtues, like contentment, his musical instruments, and plays the seven notes of the love of the Lord.<BR>
 The notes he plays are the renunciation of pride and power; his feet keep the beat on the straight path.<BR>
 He does not enter the cycle of reincarnation ever again; he keeps the One Word of the Shabad tied to the hem of his robe. ||2||<BR>
 To play like Naarad, is to know that the Lord is ever-present.<BR>
 The tinkling of the ankle bells is the shedding of sorrows and worries.<BR>
 The dramatic gestures of acting are celestial bliss.<BR>
 Such a dancer is not reincarnated again. ||3||<BR>
 If anyone, out of millions of people, becomes pleasing to his Lord and Master, he sings the Lord's Praises in this way.<BR>
 I have taken the Support of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<BR>
 Says Nanak, the Kirtan of the One Lord's Praises are sung there. ||4||8||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Some call Him, 'Raam, Raam', and some call Him, 'Khudaa-i'.<BR>
 Some serve Him as 'Gusain', others as 'Allaah'. ||1||<BR>
 He is the Cause of causes, the Generous Lord.<BR>
 He showers His Grace and Mercy upon us. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Some bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, and some make the pilgrimage to Mecca.|<BR>
 Some perform devotional worship services, and some bow their heads in prayer. ||2||<BR>
 Some read the Vedas, and some the Koran.<BR>
 Some wear blue robes, and some wear white. ||3||<BR>
 Some call themselves Muslim, and some call themselves Hindu.<BR>
 Some yearn for paradise, and others long for heaven. ||4||<BR>
 Says Nanak, one who realizes the Hukam of God's Will,<BR>
 knows the secrets of his Lord and Master. ||5||9||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The wind merges into the wind.<BR>
 The light blends into the light.<BR>
 The dust becomes one with the dust.<BR>
 What support is there for the one who is lamenting? ||1||<BR>
 Who has died? O, who has died?<BR>
 O God-realized beings, meet together and consider this. What a wondrous thing has happened! ||1||Pause||<BR>
 No one knows what happens after death.<BR>
 The one who is lamenting will also arise and depart.<BR>
 Mortal beings are bound by the bonds of doubt and attachment.<BR>
 When life becomes a dream, the blind man babbles and grieves in vain. ||2||<BR>
 The Creator Lord created this creation.<BR>
 It comes and goes, subject to the Will of the Infinite Lord.<BR>
 No one dies; no one is capable of dying.<BR>
 The soul does not perish; it is imperishable. ||3||<BR>
 That which is known, does not exist.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to the one who knows this.<BR>
 Says Nanak, the Guru has dispelled my doubt.<BR>
 No one dies; no one comes or goes. ||4||10||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Meditate on the Lord of the Universe, the Beloved Lord of the World.<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance on the Lord's Name, you shall live, and the Great Death shall not consume you ever again. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Through millions of incarnations, you have come, wandering, wandering, wandering.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 011</H2></CENTER>
 By the highest destiny, you found the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||<BR>
 Without the Perfect Guru, no one is saved.<BR>
 This is what Baba Nanak says, after deep reflection. ||2||11||<BR>
 Raag Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The four Vedas proclaim it, but you don't believe them.<BR>
 The six Shaastras also say one thing.<BR>
 The eighteen Puraanas all speak of the One God.<BR>
 Even so, Yogi, you do not understand this mystery. ||1||<BR>
 The celestial harp plays the incomparable melody,<BR>
 but in your intoxication, you do not hear it, O Yogi. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 In the first age, the Golden Age, the village of truth was inhabited.<BR>
 In the Silver Age of Traytaa Yuga, things began to decline.<BR>
 In the Brass Age of Dwaapur Yuga, half of it was gone.<BR>
 Now, only one leg of Truth remains, and the One Lord is revealed. ||2||<BR>
 The beads are strung upon the one thread.<BR>
 By means of many, various, diverse knots, they are tied, and kept separate on the string.<BR>
 The beads of the mala are lovingly chanted upon in many ways.<BR>
 When the thread is pulled out, the beads come together in one place. ||3||<BR>
 Throughout the four ages, the One Lord made the body His temple.<BR>
 It is a treacherous place, with several windows.<BR>
 Searching and searching, one comes to the Lord's door.<BR>
 Then, O Nanak, the Yogi attains a home in the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||4||<BR>
 Thus, the celestial harp plays the incomparable melody;<BR>
 hearing it, the Yogi's mind finds it sweet. ||1||Second Pause||1||12||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The body is a patch-work of threads.<BR>
 The muscles are stitched together with the needles of the bones.<BR>
 The Lord has erected a pillar of water.<BR>
 O Yogi, why are you so proud? ||1||<BR>
 Meditate on your Lord Master, day and night.<BR>
 The patched coat of the body shall last for only a few days. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Smearing ashes on your body, you sit in a deep meditative trance.<BR>
 You wear the ear-rings of 'mine and yours'.<BR>
 You beg for bread, but you are not satisfied.<BR>
 Abandoning your Lord Master, you beg from others; you should feel ashamed. ||2||<BR>
 Your consciousness is restless, Yogi, as you sit in your Yogic postures.<BR>
 You blow your horn, but still feel sad.<BR>
 You do not understand Gorakh, your guru.<BR>
 Again and again, Yogi, you come and go. ||3||<BR>
 He, unto whom the Master shows Mercy<BR>
 - unto Him, the Guru, the Lord of the World, I offer my prayer.<BR>
 One who has the Name as his patched coat, and the Name as his robe,<BR>
 O servant Nanak, such a Yogi is steady and stable. ||4||<BR>
 One who meditates on the Master in this way, night and day,<BR>
 finds the Guru, the Lord of the World, in this life. ||1||Second Pause||2||13||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 He is the Creator, the Cause of causes;<BR>
 I do not see any other at all.<BR>
 My Lord and Master is wise and all-knowing.<BR>
 Meeting with the Gurmukh, I enjoy His Love. ||1||<BR>
 Such is the sweet, subtle essence of the Lord.<BR>
 How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, taste it. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Light of the Ambrosial Name of the Lord is immaculate and pure.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 012</H2></CENTER>
 Drinking it in, one becomes immortal and free of desire.<BR>
 The body and mind are cooled and soothed, and the fire is extinguished.<BR>
 Such a being is the embodiment of bliss, famous throughout the world. ||2||<BR>
 What can I offer You, Lord? Everything belongs to You.<BR>
 I am forever a sacrifice to You, hundreds of thousands of times.<BR>
 You blessed me, and fashioned my body, mind and soul.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, this lowly being was exalted. ||3||<BR>
 Opening the door, You summoned me to the Mansion of Your Presence.<BR>
 As You are, so You have revealed Yourself to me.<BR>
 Says Nanak, the screen is totally torn away;<BR>
 I am Yours, and You are enshrined within my mind. ||4||3||14||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 He has linked His servant to His service.<BR>
 The Divine Guru has poured the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, into his mouth.<BR>
 He has subdued all his anxiety.<BR>
 I am forever a sacrifice to that Guru. ||1||<BR>
 The True Guru has perfectly resolved my affairs.<BR>
 The True Guru vibrates the unstruck melody of the sound current. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 His Glory is profound and unfathomable.<BR>
 One whom He blesses with patience becomes blissful.<BR>
 One whose bonds are shattered by the Sovereign Lord<BR>
 is not cast into the womb of reincarnation again. ||2||<BR>
 One who is illuminated by the Lord's radiance within,<BR>
 is not touched by pain and sorrow.<BR>
 He holds in his robe the gems and jewels.<BR>
 That humble being is saved, along with all his generations. ||3||<BR>
 He has no doubt, double-mindedness or duality at all.<BR>
 He worships and adores the One Immaculate Lord alone.<BR>
 Wherever I look, I see the Merciful Lord.<BR>
 Says Nanak, I have found God, the source of nectar. ||4||4||15||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 My self-conceit has been eliminated from my body.<BR>
 The Will of God is dear to me.<BR>
 Whatever He does, seems sweet to my mind.<BR>
 And then, these eyes behold the wondrous Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Now, I have become wise and my demons are gone.<BR>
 My thirst is quenched, and my attachment is dispelled. The Perfect Guru has instructed me. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 In His Mercy, the Guru has kept me under His protection.<BR>
 The Guru has attached me to the Lord's Feet.<BR>
 When the mind is totally held in check,<BR>
 one sees the Guru and the Supreme Lord God as one and the same. ||2||<BR>
 Whoever You have created, I am his slave.<BR>
 My God dwells in all.<BR>
 I have no enemies, no adversaries.<BR>
 I walk arm in arm, like brothers, with all. ||3||<BR>
 One whom the Guru, the Lord, blesses with peace,<BR>
 does not suffer in pain any longer.<BR>
 He Himself cherishes all.<BR>
 Nanak is imbued with the love of the Lord of the World. ||4||5||16||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 You read the scriptures, and the commentaries,<BR>
 but the Perfect Lord does not dwell in your heart.<BR>
 You preach to others to have faith,<BR>
 but you do not practice what you preach. ||1||<BR>
 O Pandit, O religious scholar, contemplate the Vedas.<BR>
 Eradicate anger from your mind, O Pandit. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You place your stone god before yourself,<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 013</H2></CENTER>
 but your mind wanders in the ten directions.<BR>
 You apply a ceremonial tilak mark to its forehead, and fall at its feet.<BR>
 You try to appease the people, and act blindly. ||2||<BR>
 You perform the six religious rituals, and sit wearing your loin-cloth.<BR>
 In the homes of the wealthy, you read the prayer book.<BR>
 You chant on your mala, and beg for money.<BR>
 No one has ever been saved in this way, friend. ||3||<BR>
 He alone is a Pandit, who lives the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 Maya, of the three qualities, leaves him.<BR>
 The four Vedas are completely contained within the Lord's Name.<BR>
 Nanak seeks His Sanctuary. ||4||6||17||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Millions of troubles do not come near him;<BR>
 the many manifestations of Maya are his hand-maidens;<BR>
 countless sins are his water-carriers;<BR>
 he is blessed with the Grace of the Creator Lord. ||1||<BR>
 One who has the Lord God as his help and support<BR>
 - all his efforts are fulfilled. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He is protected by the Creator Lord; what harm can anyone do to him?<BR>
 Even an ant can conquer the whole world.<BR>
 His glory is endless; how can I describe it?<BR>
 I am a sacrifice, a devoted sacrifice, to His feet. ||2||<BR>
 He alone performs worship, austerities and meditation;<BR>
 he alone is a giver to various charities;<BR>
 he alone is approved in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga,<BR>
 whom the Lord Master blesses with honor. ||3||<BR>
 Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I am enlightened.<BR>
 I have found celestial peace, and my hopes are fulfilled.<BR>
 The Perfect True Guru has blessed me with faith.<BR>
 Nanak is the slave of His slaves. ||4||7||18||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Don't blame others, O people;<BR>
 as you plant, so shall you harvest.<BR>
 By your actions, you have bound yourself.<BR>
 You come and go, entangled in Maya. ||1||<BR>
 Such is the understanding of the Saintly people.<BR>
 You shall be enlightened, through the Word of the Perfect Guru. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Body, wealth, spouse and ostentatious displays are false.<BR>
 Horses and elephants will pass away.<BR>
 Power, pleasures and beauty are all false.<BR>
 Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, everything is reduced to dust. ||2||<BR>
 The egotistical people are deluded by useless doubt.<BR>
 Of all this expanse, nothing shall go along with you.<BR>
 Through pleasure and pain, the body is growing old.<BR>
 Doing these things, the faithless cynics are passing their lives. ||3||<BR>
 The Name of the Lord is Ambrosial Nectar in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.<BR>
 This treasure is obtained from the Holy.<BR>
 O Nanak, whoever pleases the Guru,<BR>
 the Lord of the Universe, beholds the Lord in each and every heart. ||4||8||19||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The Panch Shabad, the five primal sounds, echo the perfect sound current of the Naad.<BR>
 The wondrous, amazing unstruck melody vibrates.<BR>
 The Saintly people play there with the Lord.<BR>
 They remain totally detached, absorbed in the Supreme Lord God. ||1||<BR>
 It is the realm of celestial peace and bliss.<BR>
 The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, sits and sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. There is no disease or sorrow there, no birth or death. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 There, they meditate only on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 How rare are those who find this place of rest.<BR>
 The love of God is their food, and the Kirtan of the Lord's Praise is their support.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 014</H2></CENTER>
 They obtain a permanent seat in the infinite. ||2||<BR>
 No one falls there, or wavers, or goes anywhere.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, some find this mansion.<BR>
 They are not touched by doubt, fear, attachment or the traps of Maya.<BR>
 They enter the deepest state of Samaadhi, through the kind mercy of God. ||3||<BR>
 He has no end or limitation.<BR>
 He Himself is unmanifest, and He Himself is manifest.<BR>
 One who enjoys the taste of the Lord, Har, Har, deep within himself,<BR>
 O Nanak, his wondrous state cannot be described. ||4||9||20||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Meeting with the Sangat, the Congregation, the Supreme Lord God has come into my consciousness.<BR>
 In the Sangat, my mind has found contentment.<BR>
 I touch my forehead to the feet of the Saints.<BR>
 Countless times, I humbly bow to the Saints. ||1||<BR>
 This mind is a sacrifice to the Saints;<BR>
 holding tight to their support, I have found peace, and in their mercy, they have protected me. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I wash the feet of the Saints, and drink in that water.<BR>
 Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Saints' Darshan, I live.<BR>
 My mind rests its hopes in the Saints.<BR>
 The Saints are my immaculate wealth. ||2||<BR>
 The Saints have covered my faults.<BR>
 By the Grace of the Saints, I am no longer tormented.<BR>
 The Merciful Lord has blessed me with the Saints' Congregation.<BR>
 The Compassionate Saints have become my help and support. ||3||<BR>
 My consciousness, intellect and wisdom have been enlightened.<BR>
 The Lord is profound, unfathomable, infinite, the treasure of virtue.<BR>
 He cherishes all beings and creatures.<BR>
 Nanak is enraptured, seeing the Saints. ||4||10||21||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Your home, power and wealth will be of no use to you.<BR>
 Your corrupt worldly entanglements will be of no use to you.<BR>
 Know that all your dear friends are fake.<BR>
 Only the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, will go along with you. ||1||<BR>
 Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name, O friend; remembering the Lord in meditation, your honor shall be saved.<BR>
 Remembering the Lord in meditation, the Messenger of Death will not touch you. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Without the Lord, all pursuits are useless.<BR>
 Gold, silver and wealth are just dust.<BR>
 Chanting the Word of the Guru's Shabad, your mind shall be at peace.<BR>
 Here and hereafter, your face shall be radiant and bright. ||2||<BR>
 Even the greatest of the great worked and worked until they were exhausted.<BR>
 None of them ever accomplished the tasks of Maya.<BR>
 Any humble being who chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,<BR>
 will have all his hopes fulfilled. ||3||<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the anchor and support of the Lord's devotees.<BR>
 The Saints are victorious in this priceless human life.<BR>
 Whatever the Lord's Saint does, is approved and accepted.<BR>
 Slave Nanak is a sacrifice to him. ||4||11||22||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 You gather wealth by exploiting people.<BR>
 It is of no use to you; it was meant for others.<BR>
 You practice egotism, and act like a blind man.<BR>
 In the world hereafter, you shall be tied to the leash of the Messenger of Death. ||1||<BR>
 Give up your envy of others, you fool!<BR>
 You only live here for a night, you fool!<BR>
 You are intoxicated with Maya, but you must soon arise and depart.<BR>
 You are totally involved in the dream. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 In his childhood, the child is blind.<BR>
 In the fullness of youth, he is involved in foul-smelling sins.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 015</H2></CENTER>
 In the third stage of life, he gathers the wealth of Maya.<BR>
 And when he grows old, he must leave all this; he departs regretting and repenting. ||2||<BR>
 After a very long time, one obtains this precious human body, so difficult to obtain.<BR>
 Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, it is reduced to dust.<BR>
 Worse than a beast, a demon or an idiot,<BR>
 is that one who does not understand who created him. ||3||<BR>
 Listen, O Creator Lord, Lord of the Universe, Lord of the World,<BR>
 Merciful to the meek, forever compassionate<BR>
 - If You emancipate the human, then his bonds are broken.<BR>
 O Nanak, the people of world are blind; please, Lord, forgive them, and unite them with Yourself. ||4||12||23||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Joining the elements together, the robe of the body is fashioned.<BR>
 The ignorant fool is engrossed in it.<BR>
 He cherishes it, and constantly takes care of it.<BR>
 But at the very last moment, he must arise and depart. ||1||<BR>
 Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, everything is false, O mortal.<BR>
 Those who do not vibrate and meditate on the Lord of the Universe, but instead are imbued with other things, - all those mortals are plundered by Maya. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Bathing at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, filth is not washed off.<BR>
 Religious rituals are all just egotistical displays.<BR>
 By pleasing and appeasing people, no one is saved.<BR>
 Without the Naam, they shall depart weeping. ||2||<BR>
 Without the Lord's Name, the screen is not torn away.<BR>
 I have studied all the Shaastras and Simritees.<BR>
 He alone chants the Naam, whom the Lord Himself inspires to chant.<BR>
 He obtains all fruits and rewards, and merges in peace. ||3||<BR>
 O Savior Lord, please save me!<BR>
 All peace and comforts are in Your Hand, God.<BR>
 Whatever you attach me to, to that I am attached, O my Lord and Master.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Lord is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. ||4||13||24||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Whatever He does makes me happy.<BR>
 The ignorant mind is encouraged, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<BR>
 Now, it does not waver at all; it has become stable and steady.<BR>
 Receiving Truth, it is merged in the True Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Pain is gone, and all illness is gone.<BR>
 I have accepted the Will of God in my mind, associating with the Great Person, the Guru. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 All is pure; all is immaculate.<BR>
 Whatever exists is good.<BR>
 Wherever He keeps me, that is the place of liberation for me.<BR>
 Whatever He makes me chant, is His Name. ||2||<BR>
 That is the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, where the Holy place their feet,<BR>
 and that is heaven, where the Naam is chanted.<BR>
 All bliss comes, when one obtains the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.<BR>
 I sing continuously, continually, the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 The Lord Himself is pervading in each and every heart.<BR>
 The glory of the Merciful Lord is radiant and manifest.<BR>
 The shutters are opened, and doubts have run away.<BR>
 Nanak has met with the Perfect Guru. ||4||14||25||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Millions of meditations and austerities rest in him,<BR>
 along with wealth, wisdom, miraculous spiritual powers and angelic spiritual insight.<BR>
 He enjoys the various shows and forms, pleasures and delicacies;<BR>
 the Naam, the Name of the Lord, dwells within the heart of the Gurmukh. ||1||<BR>
 Such is the glorious greatness of the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Its value cannot be described. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He alone is brave, patient and perfectly wise;<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 016</H2></CENTER>
 he is intuitively in Samaadhi, profound and unfathomable.<BR>
 He is liberated forever and all his affairs are perfectly resolved;<BR>
 the Lord's Name abides within his heart. ||2||<BR>
 He is totally peaceful, blissful and healthy;<BR>
 he looks upon all impartially, and is perfectly detached.<BR>
 He does not come and go, and he never wavers;<BR>
 the Naam abides in his mind. ||3||<BR>
 God is Merciful to the meek; He is the Lord of the World, the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 The Gurmukh meditates on Him, and his worries are gone.<BR>
 The Guru has blessed Nanak with the Naam;<BR>
 he serves the Saints, and works for the Saints. ||4||15||26||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, and the Beej Mantra, the Seed Mantra.<BR>
 Even the homeless find a home in the world hereafter.<BR>
 Fall at the feet of the Perfect Guru;<BR>
 you have slept for so many incarnations - wake up! ||1||<BR>
 Chant the Chant of the Lord's Name, Har, Har.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, it shall be enshrined within your heart, and you shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Meditate on the eternal treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, O mind,<BR>
 and then, the screen of Maya shall be torn away.<BR>
 Drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Guru's Shabad,<BR>
 and then your soul shall be rendered immaculate and pure. ||2||<BR>
 Searching, searching, searching, I have realized<BR>
 that without devotional worship of the Lord, no one is saved.<BR>
 So vibrate, and meditate on that Lord in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy;<BR>
 your mind and body shall be imbued with love for the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 Renounce all your cleverness and trickery.<BR>
 O mind, without the Lord's Name, there is no place of rest.<BR>
 The Lord of the Universe, the Lord of the World, has taken pity on me.<BR>
 Nanak seeks the protection and support of the Lord, Har, Har. ||4||16||27||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 In the Saints' Congregation, play joyfully with the Lord,<BR>
 and you will not have to meet the Messenger of Death hereafter.<BR>
 Your egotistical intellect shall be dispelled,<BR>
 and your evil-mindedness will be totally taken away. ||1||<BR>
 Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name, O Pandit.<BR>
 Religious rituals and egotism are of no use at all. You shall go home with happiness, O Pandit. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I have earned the profit, the wealth of the Lord's praise.<BR>
 All my hopes have been fulfilled.<BR>
 Pain has left me, and peace has come to my home.<BR>
 By the Grace of the Saints, my heart-lotus blossoms forth. ||2||<BR>
 One who is blessed with the gift of the jewel of the Name,<BR>
 obtains all treasures.<BR>
 His mind becomes content, finding the Perfect Lord.<BR>
 Why should he ever go begging again? ||3||<BR>
 Hearing the Lord's sermon, he becomes pure and holy.<BR>
 Chanting it with his tongue, he finds the way to salvation.<BR>
 He alone is approved, who enshrines the Lord within his heart.<BR>
 Nanak: such a humble being is exalted, O Siblings of Destiny. ||4||17||28||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 No matter how hard you try to grab it, it does not come into your hands.<BR>
 No matter how much you may love it, it does not go along with you.<BR>
 Says Nanak, when you abandon it,<BR>
 then it comes and falls at your feet. ||1||<BR>
 Listen, O Saints: this is the pure philosophy.<BR>
 Without the Lord's Name, there is no salvation. Meeting with the Perfect Guru, one is saved. ||1||Pause||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 017</H2></CENTER>
 When someone tries to appease her,<BR>
 then she takes pride in herself.<BR>
 But when someone puts her out of his thoughts,<BR>
 then she serves him like a slave. ||2||<BR>
 She seems to please, but in the end, she deceives.<BR>
 She does not remain in any one place.<BR>
 She has bewitched a great many worlds.<BR>
 The Lord's humble servants cut her apart into pieces. ||3||<BR>
 Whoever begs from her remains hungry.<BR>
 Whoever is infatuated with her obtains nothing.<BR>
 But one who renounces her, and joins the Society of the Saints,<BR>
 by great good fortune, O Nanak, is saved. ||4||18||29||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 See the Lord, the Universal Soul, in all.<BR>
 The One God is perfect, and all-pervading.<BR>
 Know that the priceless jewel is within your own heart.<BR>
 Realize that your essence is within your own self. ||1||<BR>
 Drink in the Ambrosial Nectar, by the Grace of the Saints.<BR>
 One who is blessed with high destiny, obtains it. Without a tongue, how can one know the taste? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 How can a deaf person listen to the eighteen Puraanas and the Vedas?<BR>
 The blind man cannot see even a million lights.<BR>
 The beast loves grass, and remains attached to it.<BR>
 One who has not been taught - how can he understand? ||2||<BR>
 God, the Knower, knows all.<BR>
 He is with His devotees, through and through.<BR>
 Those who sing God's Praises with joy and delight,<BR>
 O Nanak - the Messenger of Death does not even approach them. ||3||19||30||<BR>

 You look upon your children, spouse and wealth; none of these will go along with you.<BR>
 Eating the poisonous potion, you have gone astray. You will have to go, and leave Maya and your mansions. ||1||<BR>
 Slandering others, you are totally ruined; because of your past actions, you shall be consigned to the womb of reincarnation.<BR>
 Your past actions will not just go away; the most horrible Messenger of Death shall seize you. ||2||<BR>
 You tell lies, and do not practice what you preach. Your desires are not satisfied - what a shame.<BR>
 You have contracted an incurable disease; slandering the Saints, your body is wasting away; you are utterly ruined. ||3||<BR>
 He embellishes those whom He has fashioned. He Himself gave life to the Saints.<BR>
 O Nanak, He hugs His slaves close in His Embrace. Please grant Your Grace, O Supreme Lord God, and be kind to me as well. ||4||44||55||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Such is the Perfect Divine Guru, my help and support.<BR>
 Meditation on Him is not wasted. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, I am enraptured.<BR>
 The dust of His feet snaps the noose of Death.<BR>
 His lotus feet dwell within my mind,<BR>
 and so all the affairs of my body are arranged and resolved. ||1||<BR>
 One upon whom He places His Hand, is protected.<BR>
 My God is the Master of the masterless.<BR>
 He is the Savior of sinners, the treasure of mercy.<BR>
 Forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to Him. ||2||<BR>
 One whom He blesses with His Immaculate Mantra,<BR>
 renounces corruption; his egotistical pride is dispelled.<BR>
 Meditate on the One Lord in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<BR>
 Sins are erased, through the love of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 The Guru, the Transcendent Lord, dwells among all.<BR>
 The treasure of virtue pervades and permeates each and every heart.<BR>
 Please grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan;<BR>
 O God, I place my hopes in You. Nanak continually offers this true prayer. ||4||45||56||<BR>

 Raag Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl, Second House, Du-Padas:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Sing the songs of Praise of the Lord.<BR>
 Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, total peace is obtained; coming and going is ended, my friend. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, one is enlightened,<BR>
 and comes to dwell in His lotus feet. ||1||<BR>
 In the Society of the Saints, one is saved.<BR>
 O Nanak, he crosses over the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||1||57||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 My Guru is perfect, my Guru is perfect.<BR>
 Chanting the Lord's Name, I am always at peace; all my illness and fraud is dispelled. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Worship and adore that One Lord alone.<BR>
 In His Sanctuary, eternal peace is obtained. ||1||<BR>
 One who feels hunger for the Naam sleeps in peace.<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, all pains are dispelled. ||2||<BR>
 Enjoy celestial bliss, O my Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 The Perfect Guru has eradicated all anxiety. ||3||<BR>
 Twenty-four hours a day, chant God's Chant.<BR>
 O Nanak, He Himself shall save you. ||4||2||58||<BR>
 Raag Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl, Partaal, Third House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 I humbly bow to the Lord, the Supreme Being.<BR>
 The One, the One and Only Creator Lord permeates the water, the land, the earth and the sky. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Over and over again, the Creator Lord destroys, sustains and creates.<BR>
 He has no home; He needs no nourishment. ||1||<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is deep and profound, strong, poised, lofty, exalted and infinite.<BR>
 He stages His plays; His Virtues are priceless. Nanak is a sacrifice to Him. ||2||1||59||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 You must abandon your beauty, pleasures, fragrances and enjoyments; beguiled by gold and sexual desire, you must still leave Maya behind. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You gaze upon billions and trillions of treasures and riches, which delight and comfort your mind,<BR>
 but these will not go along with you. ||1||<BR>
 Entangled with children, spouse, siblings and friends, you are enticed and fooled; these pass like the shadow of a tree.<BR>
 Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of His lotus feet; He has found peace in the faith of the Saints. ||2||2||60||<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Raag Raamkalee, Ninth Mehl, Ti-Padas:<BR>
 O mind, take the sheltering support of the Lord's Name.<BR>
 Remembering Him in meditation, evil-mindedness is dispelled, and the state of Nirvaanaa is obtained. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Know that one who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord is very fortunate.<BR>
 The sins of countless incarnations are washed off, and he attains the heavenly realm. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 027</H2></CENTER>
 At the very last moment, Ajaamal became aware of the Lord;<BR>
 that state which even the supreme Yogis desire - he attained that state in an instant. ||2||<BR>
 The elephant had no virtue and no knowledge; what religious rituals has he performed?<BR>
 O Nanak, behold the way of the Lord, who bestowed the gift of fearlessness. ||3||1||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 Holy people: what way should I now adopt,<BR>
 by which all evil-mindedness may be dispelled, and the mind may vibrate in devotional worship to the Lord? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 My mind is entangled in Maya; it knows nothing at all of spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 What is that Name, by which the world, contemplating it, might attain the state of Nirvaanaa? ||1||<BR>
 When the Saints became kind and compassionate, they told me this.<BR>
 Understand, that whoever sings the Kirtan of God's Praises, has performed all religious rituals. ||2||<BR>
 One who enshrines the Lord's Name in his heart night and day - even for an instant<BR>
 - has his fear of Death eradicated. O Nanak, his life is approved and fulfilled. ||3||2||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Ninth Mehl:<BR>
 O mortal, focus your thoughts on the Lord.<BR>
 Moment by moment, your life is running out; night and day, your body is passing away in vain. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You have wasted your youth in corrupt pleasures, and your childhood in ignorance.<BR>
 You have grown old, and even now, you do not understand, the evil-mindedness in which you are entangled. ||1||<BR>
 Why have you forgotten your Lord and Master, who blessed you with this human life?<BR>
 Remembering Him in meditation, one is liberated. And yet, you do not sing His Praises, even for an instant. ||2||<BR>
 Why are you intoxicated with Maya? It will not go along with you.<BR>
 Says Nanak, think of Him, remember Him in your mind. He is the Fulfiller of desires, who will be your help and support in the end. ||3||3||81||<BR>
 Raamkalee, First Mehl, Ashtapadees:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The same moon rises, and the same stars; the same sun shines in the sky.<BR>
 The earth is the same, and the same wind blows. The age in which we dwell affects living beings, but not these places. ||1||<BR>
 Give up your attachment to life.<BR>
 Those who act like tyrants are accepted and approved - recognize that this is the sign of the Dark Age of Kali Yuga. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Kali Yuga has not been heard to have come to any country, or to be sitting at any sacred shrine.<BR>
 It is not where the generous person gives to charities, nor seated in the mansion he has built. ||2||<BR>
 If someone practices Truth, he is frustrated; prosperity does not come to the home of the sincere.<BR>
 If someone chants the Lord's Name, he is scorned. These are the signs of Kali Yuga. ||3||<BR>
 Whoever is in charge, is humiliated. Why should the servant be afraid,<BR>
 when the master is put in chains? He dies at the hands of his servant. ||4||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 028</H2></CENTER>
 Chant the Praises of the Lord; Kali Yuga has come.<BR>
 The justice of the previous three ages is gone. One obtains virtue, only if the Lord bestows it. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 In this turbulent age of Kali Yuga, Muslim law decides the cases, and the blue-robed Qazi is the judge.<BR>
 The Guru's Bani has taken the place of Brahma's Veda, and the singing of the Lord's Praises are good deeds. ||5||<BR>
 Worship without faith; self-discipline without truthfulness; the ritual of the sacred thread without chastity - what good are these?<BR>
 You may bathe and wash, and apply a ritualistic tilak mark to your forehead, but without inner purity, there is no understanding. ||6||<BR>
 In Kali Yuga, the Koran and the Bible have become famous.<BR>
 The Pandit's scriptures and the Puraanas are not respected.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Lord's Name now is Rehmaan, the Merciful.<BR>
 Know that there is only One Creator of the creation. ||7||<BR>
 Nanak has obtained the glorious greatness of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. There is no action higher than this.<BR>
 If someone goes out to beg for what is already in his own home, then he should be chastised. ||8||1||<BR>
 Raamkalee, First Mehl:<BR>
 You preach to the world, and set up your house.<BR>
 Abandoning your Yogic postures, how will you find the True Lord?<BR>
 You are attached to possessiveness and the love of sexual pleasure.<BR>
 You are not a renunciate, nor a man of the world. ||1||<BR>
 Yogi, remain seated, and the pain of duality will run away from you.<BR>
 You beg from door to door, and you don't feel ashamed. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You sing the songs, but you do not understand your own self.<BR>
 How will the burning pain within be relieved?<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, let your mind be absorbed in the Lord's Love,<BR>
 and you will intuitively experience the charity of contemplation. ||2||<BR>
 You apply ashes to your body, while acting in hypocrisy.<BR>
 Attached to Maya, you will be beaten by Death's heavy club.<BR>
 Your begging bowl is broken; it will not hold the charity of the Lord's Love.<BR>
 Bound in bondage, you come and go. ||3||<BR>
 You do not control your seed and semen, and yet you claim to practice abstinence.<BR>
 You beg from Maya, lured by the three qualities.<BR>
 You have no compassion; the Lord's Light does not shine in you.<BR>
 You are drowned, drowned in worldly entanglements. ||4||<BR>
 You wear religious robes, and your patched coat assumes many disguises.<BR>
 You play all sorts of false tricks, like a juggler.<BR>
 The fire of anxiety burns brightly within you.<BR>
 Without the karma of good actions, how can you cross over? ||5||<BR>
 You make ear-rings of glass to wear in your ears.<BR>
 But liberation does not come from learning without understanding.<BR>
 You are lured by the tastes of the tongue and sex organs.<BR>
 You have become a beast; this sign cannot be erased. ||6||<BR>
 The people of the world are entangled in the three modes; the Yogis are entangled in the three modes.<BR>
 Contemplating the Word of the Shabad, sorrows are dispelled.<BR>
 Through the Shabad, one becomes radiant, pure and truthful.<BR>
 One who contemplates the true lifestyle is a Yogi. ||7||<BR>
 The nine treasures are with You, Lord; You are potent, the Cause of causes.<BR>
 You establish and disestablish; whatever You do, happens.<BR>
 One who practices celibacy, chastity, self-control, truth and pure consciousness<BR>
 - O Nanak, that Yogi is the friend of the three worlds. ||8||2||<BR>
 Raamkalee, First Mehl:<BR>
 Above the six chakras of the body dwells the detached mind.<BR>
 Awareness of the vibration of the Word of the Shabad has been awakened deep within.<BR>
 The unstruck melody of the sound current resonates and resounds within; my mind is attuned to it.<BR>
 Through the Guru's Teachings, my faith is confirmed in the True Name. ||1||<BR>
 O mortal, through devotion to the Lord, peace is obtained.<BR>
 The Lord, Har, Har, seems sweet to the Gurmukh, who merges in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 029</H2></CENTER>
 Eradicating attachment to Maya, one merges into the Lord.<BR>
 Meeting with the True Guru, we unite in His Union.<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is a priceless jewel, a diamond.<BR>
 Attuned to it, the mind is comforted and encouraged. ||2||<BR>
 The diseases of egotism and possessiveness do not afflict<BR>
 one who worships the Lord. Fear of the Messenger of Death runs away.<BR>
 The Messenger of Death, the enemy of the soul, does not touch me at all.<BR>
 The Immaculate Name of the Lord illuminates my heart. ||3||<BR>
 Contemplating the Shabad, we become Nirankaari - we come to belong to the Formless Lord God.<BR>
 Awakening to the Guru's Teachings, evil-mindedness is taken away.<BR>
 Remaining awake and aware night and day, lovingly focused on the Lord,<BR>
 one becomes Jivan Mukta - liberated while yet alive. He finds this state deep within himself. ||4||<BR>
 In the secluded cave, I remain unattached.<BR>
 With the Word of the Shabad, I have killed the five thieves.<BR>
 My mind does not waver or go to the home of any other.<BR>
 I remain intuitively absorbed deep within. ||5||<BR>
 As Gurmukh, I remain awake and aware, unattached.<BR>
 Forever detached, I am woven into the essence of reality.<BR>
 The world is asleep; it dies, and comes and goes in reincarnation.<BR>
 Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it does not understand. ||6||<BR>
 The unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates day and night.<BR>
 The Gurmukh knows the state of the eternal, unchanging Lord God.<BR>
 When someone realizes the Shabad, then he truly knows.<BR>
 The One Lord is permeating and pervading everywhere in Nirvaanaa. ||7||<BR>
 My mind is intuitively absorbed in the state of deepest Samaadhi;<BR>
 renouncing egotism and greed, I have come to know the One Lord.<BR>
 When the disciple's mind accepts the Guru,<BR>
 O Nanak, duality is eradicated, and he merges in the Lord. ||8||3||<BR>
 Raamkalee, First Mehl:<BR>
 You calculate the auspicious days, but you do not understand<BR>
 that the One Creator Lord is above these auspicious days.<BR>
 He alone knows the way, who meets the Guru.<BR>
 When one follows the Guru's Teachings, then he realizes the Hukam of God's Command. ||1||<BR>
 Do not tell lies, O Pandit; O religious scholar, speak the Truth.<BR>
 When egotism is eradicated through the Word of the Shabad, then one finds His home. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Calculating and counting, the astrologer draws the horoscope.<BR>
 He studies it and announces it, but he does not understand reality.<BR>
 Understand, that the Word of the Guru's Shabad is above all.<BR>
 Do not speak of anything else; it is all just ashes. ||2||<BR>
 You bathe, wash, and worship stones.<BR>
 But without being imbued with the Lord, you are the filthiest of the filthy.<BR>
 Subduing your pride, you shall receive the supreme wealth of God.<BR>
 The mortal is liberated and emancipated, meditating on the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 You study the arguments, but do not contemplate the Vedas.<BR>
 You drown yourself - how will you save your ancestors?<BR>
 How rare is that person who realizes that God is in each and every heart.<BR>
 When one meets the True Guru, then he understands. ||4||<BR>
 Making his calculations, cynicism and suffering afflict his soul.<BR>
 Seeking the Sanctuary of the Guru, peace is found.<BR>
 I sinned and made mistakes, but now I seek Your Sanctuary.<BR>
 The Guru led me to meet the Lord, according to my past actions. ||5||<BR>
 If one does not enter the Guru's Sanctuary, God cannot be found.<BR>
 Deluded by doubt, one is born, only to die, and come back again.<BR>
 Dying in corruption, he is bound and gagged at Death's door.<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is not in his heart, and he does not act according to the Shabad. ||6||<BR>
 Some call themselves Pandits, religious scholars and spiritual teachers.<BR>
 Tinged with double-mindedness, they do not find the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 030</H2></CENTER>
 One who takes the Support of the Naam, by Guru's Grace,<BR>
 is a rare person, one among millions, incomparable. ||7||<BR>
 One is bad, and another good, but the One True Lord is contained in all.<BR>
 Understand this, O spiritual teacher, through the support of the True Guru:<BR>
 rare indeed is that Gurmukh, who realizes the One Lord.<BR>
 His comings and goings cease, and he merges in the Lord. ||8||<BR>
 Those who have the One Universal Creator Lord within their hearts,<BR>
 possess all virtues; they contemplate the True Lord.<BR>
 One who acts in harmony with the Guru's Will,<BR>
 O Nanak, is absorbed in the Truest of the True. ||9||4||<BR>
 Raamkalee, First Mehl:<BR>
 Practicing restraint by Hatha Yoga, the body wears away.<BR>
 The mind is not softened by fasting or austerities.<BR>
 Nothing else is equal to worship of the Lord's Name. ||1||<BR>
 Serve the Guru, O mind, and associate with the humble servants of the Lord.<BR>
 The tyrannical Messenger of Death cannot touch you, and the serpent of Maya cannot sting you, when you drink in the sublime essence of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The world reads the arguments, and is softened only by music.<BR>
 In the three modes and corruption, they are born and die.<BR>
 Without the Lord's Name, they endure suffering and pain. ||2||<BR>
 The Yogi draws the breath upwards, and opens the Tenth Gate.<BR>
 He practices inner cleansing and the six rituals of purification.<BR>
 But without the Lord's Name, the breath he draws is useless. ||3||<BR>
 The fire of the five passions burns within him; how can he be calm?<BR>
 The thief is within him; how can he taste the taste?<BR>
 One who becomes Gurmukh conquers the body-fortress. ||4||<BR>
 With filth within, he wanders around at places of pilgrimage.<BR>
 His mind is not pure, so what is the use of performing ritual cleansings?<BR>
 He carries the karma of his own past actions; who else can he blame? ||5||<BR>
 He does not eat food; he tortures his body.<BR>
 Without the Guru's wisdom, he is not satisfied.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh is born only to die, and be born again. ||6||<BR>
 Go, and ask the True Guru, and associate with the Lord's humble servants.<BR>
 Your mind shall merge into the Lord, and you shall not be reincarnated to die again.<BR>
 Without the Lord's Name, what can anyone do? ||7||<BR>
 Silence the mouse scurrying around within you.<BR>
 Serve the Primal Lord, by chanting the Lord's Name.<BR>
 O Nanak, God blesses us with His Name, when He grants His Grace. ||8||5||<BR>
 Raamkalee, First Mehl:<BR>
 The created Universe emanated from within You; there is no other at all.<BR>
 Whatever is said to be, is from You, O God.<BR>
 He is the True Lord and Master, throughout the ages.<BR>
 Creation and destruction do not come from anyone else. ||1||<BR>
 Such is my Lord and Master, profound and unfathomable.<BR>
 Whoever meditates on Him, finds peace. The arrow of the Messenger of Death does not strike one who has the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is a priceless jewel, a diamond.<BR>
 The True Lord Master is immortal and immeasurable.<BR>
 That tongue which chants the True Name is pure.<BR>
 The True Lord is in the home of the self; there is no doubt about it. ||2||<BR>
 Some sit in the forests, and some make their home in the mountains.<BR>
 Forgetting the Naam, they rot away in egotistical pride.<BR>
 Without the Naam, what is the use of spiritual wisdom and meditation?<BR>
 The Gurmukhs are honored in the Court of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 Acting stubbornly in egotism, one does not find the Lord.<BR>
 Studying the scriptures, reading them to other people,<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 031</H2></CENTER>
 and wandering around at places of pilgrimage, the disease is not taken away.<BR>
 Without the Naam, how can one find peace? ||4||<BR>
 No matter how much he tries, he cannot control his semen and seed.<BR>
 His mind wavers, and he falls into hell.<BR>
 Bound and gagged in the City of Death, he is tortured.<BR>
 Without the Name, his soul cries out in agony. ||5||<BR>
 The many Siddhas and seekers, silent sages and demi-gods<BR>
 cannot satisfy themselves by practicing restraint through Hatha Yoga.<BR>
 One who contemplates the Word of the Shabad, and serves the Guru<BR>
 - his mind and body become immaculate, and his egotistical pride is obliterated. ||6||<BR>
 Blessed with Your Grace, I obtain the True Name.<BR>
 I remain in Your Sanctuary, in loving devotion.<BR>
 Love for Your devotional worship has welled up within me.<BR>
 As Gurmukh, I chant and meditate on the Lord's Name. ||7||<BR>
 When one is rid of egotism and pride, his mind is drenched in the Lord's Love.<BR>
 Practicing fraud and hypocrisy, he does not find God.<BR>
 Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he cannot find the Lord's Door.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh contemplates the essence of reality. ||8||6||<BR>
 Raamkalee, First Mehl:<BR>
 As you come, so will you leave, you fool; as you were born, so will you die.<BR>
 As you enjoy pleasures, so will you suffer pain. Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, you will fall into the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||<BR>
 Gazing upon your body and wealth, you are so proud.<BR>
 Your love for gold and sexual pleasures increases; why have you forgotten the Naam, and why do you wander in doubt? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You do not practice truth, abstinence, self-discipline or humility; the ghost within your skeleton has turned to dry wood.<BR>
 You have not practiced charity, donations, cleansing baths or austerities. Without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, your life has gone in vain. ||2||<BR>
 Attached to greed, you have forgotten the Naam. Coming and going, your life has been ruined.<BR>
 When the Messenger of Death grabs you by your hair, you will be punished. You are unconscious, and have fallen into Death's mouth. ||3||<BR>
 Day and night, you jealously slander others; in your heart, you have neither the Naam, nor compassion for all.<BR>
 Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, you will not find salvation or honor. Without the Lord's Name, you shall go to hell. ||4||<BR>
 In an instant, you change into various costumes, like a juggler; you are entangled in emotional attachment and sin.<BR>
 You gaze here and there upon the expanse of Maya; you are intoxicated with attachment to Maya. ||5||<BR>
 You act in corruption, and put on ostentatious shows, but without awareness of the Shabad, you have fallen into confusion.<BR>
 You suffer great pain from the disease of egotism. Following the Guru's Teachings, you shall be rid of this disease. ||6||<BR>
 Seeing peace and wealth come to him, the faithless cynic become proud in his mind.<BR>
 But He who owns this body and wealth, takes them back again, and then the mortal feels anxiety and pain deep within. ||7||<BR>
 At the very last instant, nothing goes along with you; all is visible only by His Mercy.<BR>
 God is our Primal and Infinite Lord; enshrining the Lord's Name in the heart, one crosses over. ||8||<BR>
 You weep for the dead, but who hears you weeping? The dead have fallen to the serpent in the terrifying world-ocean.<BR>
 Gazing upon his family, wealth, household and mansions, the faithless cynic is entangled in worthless worldly affairs. ||9||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 032</H2></CENTER>
 He comes when the Lord sends him; when the Lord calls him back, he goes.<BR>
 Whatever he does, the Lord is doing. The Forgiving Lord forgives him. ||10||<BR>
 I seek to be with those who have tasted this sublime essence of the Lord.<BR>
 Wealth, miraculous spiritual powers, wisdom and spiritual knowledge, are obtained from the Guru. The treasure of liberation is obtained in His Sanctuary. ||11||<BR>
 The Gurmukh looks upon pain and pleasure as one and the same; he remains untouched by joy and sorrow.<BR>
 Conquering his self-conceit, the Gurmukh finds the Lord; O Nanak, he intuitively merges into the Lord. ||12||7||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Dakhanee, First Mehl:<BR>
 Abstinence, chastity, self-control and truthfulness have been implanted within me; I am imbued with the sublime essence of the True Word of the Shabad. ||1||<BR>
 My Merciful Guru remains forever imbued with the Lord's Love.<BR>
 Day and night, He remains lovingly focused on the One Lord; gazing upon the True Lord, He is pleased. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He abides in the Tenth Gate, and looks equally upon all; He is imbued with the unstruck sound current of the Shabad. ||2||<BR>
 Wearing the loin-cloth of chastity, He remains absorbed in the all-pervading Lord; His tongue enjoys the taste of God's Love. ||3||<BR>
 The One who created the creation has met the True Guru; contemplating the Guru's lifestyle, He is pleased. ||4||<BR>
 All are in the One, and the One is in all. This is what the True Guru has shown me. ||5||<BR>
 He who created the worlds, solar systems and galaxies - that God cannot be known. ||6||<BR>
 From the lamp of God, the lamp within is lit; the Divine Light illuminates the three worlds. ||7||<BR>
 The Guru sits on the true throne in the true mansion; He is attuned, absorbed in the Fearless Lord. ||8||<BR>
 The Guru, the detached Yogi, has enticed the hearts of all; He plays His harp in each and every heart. ||9||<BR>
 O Nanak, in God's Sanctuary, one is emancipated; the True Guru becomes our true help and support. ||10||8||<BR>
 Raamkalee, First Mehl:<BR>
 He has made His home in the monastery of the heart; He has infused His power into the earth and the sky. ||1||<BR>
 Through the Word of the Shabad, the Gurmukhs have saved so very many, O Saints. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He conquers attachment, and eradicates egotism, and sees Your Divine Light pervading the three worlds, Lord. ||2||<BR>
 He conquers desire, and enshrines the Lord within his mind; he contemplates the Word of the True Guru's Shabad. ||3||<BR>
 The horn of consciousness vibrates the unstruck sound current; Your Light illuminates each and every heart, Lord. ||4||<BR>
 He plays the flute of the universe in his mind, and lights the fire of God. ||5||<BR>
 Bringing together the five elements, day and night, the Lord's lamp shines with the Immaculate Light of the Infinite. ||6||<BR>
 The right and left nostrils, the sun and the moon channels, are the strings of the body-harp; they vibrate the wondrous melody of the Shabad. ||7||<BR>
 The true hermit obtains a seat in the City of God, the invisible, inaccessible, infinite. ||8||<BR>
 The mind is the king of the city of the body; the five sources of knowledge dwell within it. ||9||<BR>
 Seated in his home, this king chants the Shabad; he administers justice and virtue. ||10||<BR>
 What can poor death or birth say to him? Conquering his mind, he remains dead while yet alive. ||11||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 033</H2></CENTER>
 Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are manifestations of the One God. He Himself is the Doer of deeds. ||12||<BR>
 One who purifies his body, crosses over the terrifying world-ocean; he contemplates the essence of his own soul. ||13||<BR>
 Serving the Guru, he finds everlasting peace; deep within, the Shabad permeates him, coloring him with virtue. ||14||<BR>
 The Giver of virtue unites with Himself, one who conquers egotism and desire. ||15||<BR>
 Eradicating the three qualities, dwell in the fourth state. This is the unparalleled devotional worship. ||16||<BR>
 This is the Yoga of the Gurmukh: Through the Shabad, he understands his own soul, and he enshrines within his heart the One Lord. ||17||<BR>
 Imbued with the Shabad, his mind becomes steady and stable; this is the most excellent action. ||18||<BR>
 This true hermit does not enter into religious debates or hypocrisy; the Gurmukh contemplates the Shabad. ||19||<BR>
 The Gurmukh practices Yoga - he is the true hermit; he practices abstinence and truth, and contemplates the Shabad. ||20||<BR>
 One who dies in the Shabad and conquers his mind is the true hermit; he understands the Way of Yoga. ||21||<BR>
 Attachment to Maya is the terrifying world-ocean; through the Shabad, the true hermit saves himself, and his ancestors as well. ||22||<BR>
 Contemplating the Shabad, you shall be a hero throughout the four ages, O hermit; contemplate the Word of the Guru's Bani in devotion. ||23||<BR>
 This mind is enticed by Maya, O hermit; contemplating the Shabad, you shall find release. ||24||<BR>
 He Himself forgives, and unites in His Union; Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary, Lord. ||25||9||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Third Mehl, Ashtapadees:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Make humility your ear-rings, Yogi, and compassion your patched coat.<BR>
 Let coming and going be the ashes you apply to your body, Yogi, and then you shall conquer the three worlds. ||1||<BR>
 Play that harp, Yogi,<BR>
 which vibrates the unstruck sound current, and remain lovingly absorbed in the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Make truth and contentment your plate and pouch, Yogi; take the Ambrosial Naam as your food.<BR>
 Make meditation your walking stick, Yogi, and make higher consciousness the horn you blow. ||2||<BR>
 Make your stable mind the Yogic posture you sit in, Yogi, and then you shall be rid of your tormenting desires.<BR>
 Go begging in the village of the body, Yogi, and then, you shall obtain the Naam in your lap. ||3||<BR>
 This harp does not center you in meditation, Yogi, nor does it bring the True Name into your lap.<BR>
 This harp does not bring you peace, Yogi, nor eliminate egotism from within you. ||4||<BR>
 Make the Fear of God, and the Love of God, the two gourds of your lute, Yogi, and make this body its neck.<BR>
 Become Gurmukh, and then vibrate the strings; in this way, your desires shall depart. ||5||<BR>
 One who understands the Hukam of the Lord's Command is called a Yogi; he links his consciousness to the One Lord.<BR>
 His cynicism is dispelled, and he becomes immaculately pure; this is how he finds the Way of Yoga. ||6||<BR>
 Everything that comes into view shall be destroyed; focus your consciousness on the Lord.<BR>
 Enshrine love for the True Guru, and then you shall obtain this understanding. ||7||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 034</H2></CENTER>
 This is not Yoga, O Yogi, to abandon your family and wander around.<BR>
 The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is within the household of the body. By Guru's Grace, you shall find your Lord God. ||8||<BR>
 This world is a puppet of clay, Yogi; the terrible disease, the desire for Maya is in it.<BR>
 Making all sorts of efforts, and wearing religious robes, Yogi, this disease cannot be cured. ||9||<BR>
 The Name of the Lord is the medicine, Yogi; the Lord enshrines it in the mind.<BR>
 One who becomes Gurmukh understands this; he alone finds the Way of Yoga. ||10||<BR>
 The Path of Yoga is very difficult, Yogi; he alone finds it, whom God blesses with His Grace.<BR>
 Inside and outside, he sees the One Lord; he eliminates doubt from within himself. ||11||<BR>
 So play the harp which vibrates without being played, Yogi.<BR>
 Says Nanak, thus you shall be liberated, Yogi, and remain merged in the True Lord. ||12||1||10||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The treasure of devotional worship is revealed to the Gurmukh; the True Guru has inspired me to understand this understanding. ||1||<BR>
 O Saints, the Gurmukh is blessed with glorious greatness. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Dwelling always in Truth, celestial peace wells up; sexual desire and anger are eliminated from within. ||2||<BR>
 Eradicating self-conceit, remain lovingly focused on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; through the Word of the Shabad, burn away possessiveness. ||3||<BR>
 By Him we are created, and by Him we are destroyed; in the end, the Naam will be our only help and support. ||4||<BR>
 He is ever-present; don't think that He is far away. He created the creation. ||5||<BR>
 Deep within your heart, chant the True Word of the Shabad; remain lovingly absorbed in the True Lord. ||6||<BR>
 The Priceless Naam is in the Society of the Saints; by great good fortune, it is obtained. ||7||<BR>
 Do not be deluded by doubt; serve the True Guru, and keep your mind steady in one place. ||8||<BR>
 Without the Name, everyone wanders around in confusion; they waste away their lives in vain. ||9||<BR>
 Yogi, you have lost the Way; you wander around confused. Through hypocrisy, Yoga is not attained. ||10||<BR>
 Sitting in Yogic postures in the City of God, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, you shall find Yoga. ||11||<BR>
 Restrain your restless wanderings through the Shabad, and the Naam will come to dwell in your mind. ||12||<BR>
 This body is a pool, O Saints; bathe in it, and enshrine love for the Lord. ||13||<BR>
 Those who cleanse themselves through the Naam, are the most immaculate people; through the Shabad, they wash off their filth. ||14||<BR>
 Trapped by the three qualities, the unconscious person does not think of the Naam; without the Name, he wastes away. ||15||<BR>
 The three forms of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are trapped in the three qualities, lost in confusion. ||16||<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, this triad is eradicated, and one is lovingly absorbed in the fourth state. ||17||<BR>
 The Pandits, the religious scholars, read, study and discuss the arguments; they do not understand. ||18||<BR>
 Engrossed in corruption, they wander in confusion; who can they possibly instruct, O Siblings of Destiny? ||19||<BR>
 The Bani, the Word of the humble devotee is the most sublime and exalted; it prevails throughout the ages. ||20||<BR>
 One who is committed to this Bani is emancipated, and through the Shabad, merges in Truth. ||21||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 035</H2></CENTER>
 One who searches the village of the body, through the Shabad, obtains the nine treasures of the Naam. ||22||<BR>
 Conquering desire, the mind is absorbed in intuitive ease, and then one chants the Lord's Praises without speaking. ||23||<BR>
 Let your eyes gaze upon the Wondrous Lord; let your consciousness be attached to the Unseen Lord. ||24||<BR>
 The Unseen Lord is forever absolute and immaculate; one's light merges into the Light. ||25||<BR>
 I praise my Guru forever, who has inspired me to understand this true understanding. ||26||<BR>
 Nanak offers this one prayer: through the Name, may I find salvation and honor. ||27||2||11||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Third Mehl:<BR>
 It is so hard to obtain that devotional worship of the Lord, O Saints. It cannot be described at all. ||1||<BR>
 O Saints, as Gurmukh, find the Perfect Lord,<BR>
 and worship the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Without the Lord, everything is filthy, O Saints; what offering should I place before Him? ||2||<BR>
 Whatever pleases the True Lord is devotional worship; His Will abides in the mind. ||3||<BR>
 Everyone worships Him, O Saints, but the self-willed manmukh is not accepted or approved. ||4||<BR>
 If someone dies in the Word of the Shabad, his mind become immaculate, O Saints; such worship is accepted and approved. ||5||<BR>
 Sanctified and pure are those true beings, who enshrine love for the Shabad. ||6||<BR>
 There is no worship of the Lord, other than the Name; the world wanders, deluded by doubt. ||7||<BR>
 The Gurmukh understands his own self, O Saints; he lolvingly centers his mind on the Lord's Name. ||8||<BR>
 The Immaculate Lord Himself inspires worship of Him; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it is accepted and approved. ||9||<BR>
 Those who worship Him, but do not know the Way, are polluted with the love of duality. ||10||<BR>
 One who becomes Gurmukh, knows what worship is; the Lord's Will abides within his mind. ||11||<BR>
 One who accepts the Lord's Will obtains total peace, O Saints; in the end, the Naam will be our help and support. ||12||<BR>
 One who does not understand his own self, O Saints, falsely flatters himself. ||13||<BR>
 The Messenger of Death does not give up on those who practices hypocrisy; they are dragged away in disgrace. ||14||<BR>
 Those who have the Shabad deep within, understand themselves; they find the way of salvation. ||15||<BR>
 Their minds enter into the deepest state of Samaadhi, and their light is absorbed into the Light. ||16||<BR>
 The Gurmukhs listen constantly to the Naam, and chant it in the True Congregation. ||17||<BR>
 The Gurmukhs sing the Lord's Praises, and erase self-conceit; they obtain true honor in the Court of the Lord. ||18||<BR>
 True are their words; they speak only the Truth; they lovingly focus on the True Name. ||19||<BR>
 My God is the Destroyer of fear, the Destroyer of sin; in the end, He is our only help and support. ||20||<BR>
 He Himself pervades and permeates everything; O Nanak, glorious greatness is obtained through the Naam. ||21||3||12||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Third Mehl:<BR>
 I am filthy and polluted, proud and egotistical; receiving the Word of the Shabad, my filth is taken away. ||1||<BR>
 O Saints, the Gurmukhs are saved through the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 The True Name abides deep within their hearts. The Creator Himself embellishes them. ||1||Pause||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 036</H2></CENTER>
 Touching the philosopher's stone, they themselves become the philosopher's stone; the Dear Lord Himself blesses them with His Mercy. ||2||<BR>
 Some wear religious robes, and wander around in pride; they lose their life in the gamble. ||3||<BR>
 Some worship the Lord in devotion, night and day; day and night, they keep the Lord's Name enshrined in their hearts. ||4||<BR>
 Those who are imbued with Him night and day, are spontaneously intoxicated with Him; they intuitively conquer their ego. ||5||<BR>
 Without the Fear of God, devotional worship is never performed; through the Love and the Fear of God, devotional worship is embellished. ||6||<BR>
 The Shabad burns away emotional attachment to Maya, and then one contemplates the essence of spiritual wisdom. ||7||<BR>
 The Creator Himself inspires us to act; He Himself blesses us with His treasure. ||8||<BR>
 The limits of His virtues cannot be found; I sing His Praises and contemplate the Word of the Shabad. ||9||<BR>
 I chant the Lord's Name, and praise my Dear Lord; egotism is eradicated from within me. ||10||<BR>
 The treasure of the Naam is obtained from the Guru; the treasures of the True Lord are inexhaustible. ||11||<BR>
 He Himself is pleased with His devotees; by His Grace, He infuses His strength within them. ||12||<BR>
 They always feel hunger for the True Name; they sing and contemplate the Shabad. ||13||<BR>
 Soul, body and everything are His; it is so difficult to speak of, and contemplate Him. ||14||<BR>
 Those humble beings who are attached to the Shabad are saved; they cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||15||<BR>
 Without the True Lord, no one can cross over; how rare are those who contemplate and understand this. ||16||<BR>
 We obtain only that which is pre-ordained; receiving the Lord's Shabad, we are embellished. ||17||<BR>
 Imbued with the Shabad, the body becomes golden, and loves only the True Name. ||18||<BR>
 The body is then filled to overflowing with Ambrosial Nectar, obtained by contemplating the Shabad. ||19||<BR>
 Those who seek God, find Him; others burst and die from their own egotism. ||20||<BR>
 The debaters waste away, while the servants serve, with love and affection for the Guru. ||21||<BR>
 He alone is a Yogi, who contemplates the essence of spiritual wisdom, and conquers egotism and thirsty desire. ||22||<BR>
 The True Guru, the Great Giver, is revealed to those upon whom You bestow Your Grace, O Lord. ||23||<BR>
 Those who do not serve the True Guru, and who are attached to Maya, are drowned; they die in their own egotism. ||24||<BR>
 As long as there is breath within you, so long you should serve the Lord; then, you will go and meet the Lord. ||25||<BR>
 Night and day, she remains awake and aware, day and night; she is the darling bride of her Beloved Husband Lord. ||26||<BR>
 I offer my body and mind in sacrifice to my Guru; I am a sacrifice to Him. ||27||<BR>
 Attachment to Maya will end and go away; only by contemplating the Shabad will you be saved. ||28||<BR>
 They are awake and aware, whom the Lord Himself awakens; so contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||29||<BR>
 O Nanak, those who do not remember the Naam are dead. The devotees live in contemplative meditation. ||30||4||13||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Receiving the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, from the Guru, I remain satisfied and fulfilled. ||1||<BR>
 O Saints, the Gurmukhs attain the state of liberation.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 037</H2></CENTER>
 The One Name abides deep within my heart; such is the glorious greatness of the Perfect Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He Himself is the Creator, and He Himself is the Enjoyer. He Himself gives sustenance to all. ||2||<BR>
 Whatever He wants to do, He is doing; no one else can do anything. ||3||<BR>
 He Himself fashions and creates the creation; He links each and every person to their task. ||4||<BR>
 If you serve Him, then you will find peace; the True Guru will unite you in His Union. ||5||<BR>
 The Lord Himself creates Himself; the Unseen Lord cannot be seen. ||6||<BR>
 He Himself kills, and brings back to life; He does not have even an iota of greed. ||7||<BR>
 Some are made givers, and some are made beggars; He Himself inspires us to devotional worship. ||8||<BR>
 Those who know the One Lord are very fortunate; they remain absorbed in the True Lord. ||9||<BR>
 He Himself is beautiful, He Himself is wise and clever; His worth cannot be expressed. ||10||<BR>
 He Himself infuses pain and pleasure; He Himself makes them wander around in doubt. ||11||<BR>
 The Great Giver is revealed to the Gurmukh; without the Guru, the world wanders in darkness. ||12||<BR>
 Those who taste, enjoy the flavor; the True Guru imparts this understanding. ||13||<BR>
 Some, the Lord causes to forget and lose the Name; others become Gurmukh, and are granted this understanding. ||14||<BR>
 Forever and ever, praise the Lord, O Saints; how glorious is His greatness! ||15||<BR>
 There is no other King except Him; He administers justice, as He has made it. ||16||<BR>
 His justice is always True; how rare are those who accept His Command. ||17||<BR>
 O mortal, meditate forever on the Lord, who has made the Gurmukh in His making. ||18||<BR>
 That humble being who meets with the True Guru is fulfilled; the Naam abides in his heart. ||19||<BR>
 The True Lord is Himself forever True; He announces His Bani, the Word of His Shabad. ||20||<BR>
 Nanak is wonderstruck, hearing and seeing His Lord; my God is all-pervading, everywhere. ||21||5||14||<BR>

 Some make a big show of devotional worship.<BR>
 Some practice inner cleansing teahniques, and control the breath through Kundalini Yoga.<BR>
 I am meek; I worship and adore the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||<BR>

 I do not know any other way. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Some abandon their homes, and live in the forests.<BR>

 One calls himself a wise Pandit, a religious scholar.<BR>
 One performs the six rituals to appease Shiva.<BR>
 One maintains the rituals of pure lifestyle, and does good deeds.<BR>
 I am meek; I seek the Sanctuary of the Lord, Har, Har, Har. ||7||<BR>
 I have studied the religions and rituals of all the ages.<BR>
 Without the Name, this mind is not awakened.<BR>
 Says Nanak, when I found the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,<BR>
 my thirsty desires were satisfied, and I was totally cooled and soothed. ||8||1||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 He created you out of this water.<BR>
 From clay, He fashioned your body.<BR>
 He blessed you with the light of reason and clear consciousness.<BR>
 In your mother's womb, He preserved you. ||1||<BR>
 Contemplate your Savior Lord.<BR>
 Give up all others thoughts, O mind. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He gave you your mother and father;<BR>
 he gave you your charming children and siblings;<BR>
 he gave you your spouse and friends;<BR>
 enshrine that Lord and Master in your consciousness. ||2||<BR>
 He gave you the invaluable air;<BR>

 He gave you eyes to see, and ears to hear;<BR>
 He gave you hands to work with, and a nose and a tongue;<BR>
 He gave you feet to walk upon, and the crowning glory of your head;<BR>
 O mind, worship the Feet of that Lord and Master. ||5||<BR>
 He transformed you from impure to pure;<BR>
 He installed you above the heads of all creatures;<BR>
 now, you may fulfill your destiny or not;<BR>
 Your affairs shall be resolved, O mind, meditating on God. ||6||<BR>
 Here and there, only the One God exists.<BR>
 Wherever I look, there You are.<BR>
 My mind is reluctant to serve Him;<BR>
 forgetting Him, I cannot survive, even for an instant. ||7||<BR>
 I am a sinner, without any virtue at all.<BR>
 I do not serve You, or do any good deeds.<BR>
 By great good fortune, I have found the boat - the Guru.<BR>
 Slave Nanak has crossed over, with Him. ||8||2||<BR>

 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Even in a forest fire, some trees remain green.<BR>
 The infant is released from the pain of the mother's womb.<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, fear is dispelled.<BR>
 Just so, the Sovereign Lord protects and saves the Saints. ||1||<BR>
 Such is the Merciful Lord, my Protector.<BR>

 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Receiving the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, all sins are erased, and He unites me with the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 My Guru is the Transcendent Lord, the Giver of peace.<BR>
 He implants the Naam, the Name of the Supreme Lord God within us; in the end, He is our help and support. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The source of all pain within is destroyed; I apply the dust of the feet of the Saints to my forehead. ||2||<BR>
 In an instant, He purifies the sinners, and dispels the darkness of ignorance. ||3||<BR>
 The Lord is all-powerful, the Cause of causes. Nanak seeks His Sanctuary. ||4||<BR>
 Shattering the bonds, the Guru implants the Lord's lotus feet within, and lovingly attunes us to the One Word of the Shabad. ||5||<BR>
 He has lifted me up, and pulled me out of the deep, dark pit of sin; I am attuned to the True Shabad. ||6||<BR>
 The fear of birth and death is taken away; I shall never wander again. ||7||<BR>
 This mind is imbued with the sublime elixir of the Naam; drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar, it is satisfied. ||8||<BR>
 Joining the Society of the Saints, I sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises; I dwell in the eternal, unchanging place. ||9||<BR>
 The Perfect Guru has given me the perfect teachings; there is nothing except the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny. ||10||<BR>

 The Lord Master is unlimited and endless; Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to Him. ||17||<BR>
 Being of Immortal Manifestation, He is not born; He is self-existent; He is the Light in the darkness of Kali Yuga. ||18||<BR>
 He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, the Giver of souls; gazing upon Him, I am satisfied and fulfilled. ||19||<BR>
 He is the One Universal Creator Lord, immaculate and fearless; He is permeating and pervading all the water and the land. ||20||<BR>
 He blesses His devotees with the Gift of devotional worship; Nanak longs for the Lord, O my mother. ||21||1||6||<BR>

 Study the Word of the Shabad, O beloveds. It is your anchoring support in life and in death.<BR>
 Your face shall be radiant, and you will be at peace forever, O Nanak, meditating in remembrance on the One Lord. ||1||<BR>
 My mind and body are imbued with my Beloved Lord; I have been blessed with loving devotion to the Lord, O Saints. ||1||<BR>
 The True Guru has approved my cargo, O Saints.<BR>
 He has blessed His slave with the profit of the Lord's Name; all my thirst is quenched, O Saints. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Searching and searching, I have found the One Lord, the jewel; I cannot express His value, O Saints. ||2||<BR>
 I focus my meditation on His Lotus Feet; I am absorbed in the True Vision of His Darshan, O Saints. ||3||<BR>
 Singing, singing His Glorious Praises, I am enraptured; meditating in remembrance on the Lord, I am satisfied and fulfilled, O Saints. ||4||<BR>
 The Lord, the Supreme Soul, is permeating within all; what comes, and what goes, O Saints? ||5||<BR>
 At the very beginning of time, and throughout the ages, He is, and He shall always be; He is the Giver of peace to all beings, O Saints. ||6||<BR>
 He Himself is endless; His end cannot be found. He is totally pervading and permeating everywhere, O Saints. ||7||<BR>
 Nanak: the Lord is my friend, companion, wealth, youth, son, father and mother, O Saints. ||8||2||7||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 In thought, word and deed, I contemplate the Lord's Name.<BR>
 The horrible world-ocean is very treacherous; O Nanak, the Gurmukh is carried across. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Inwardly, peace, and outwardly, peace; meditating on the Lord, evil tendencies are crushed. ||1||<BR>
 He has rid me of what was clinging to me; my Dear Lord God has blessed me with His Grace. ||2||<BR>
 The Saints are saved, in His Sanctuary; the very egotistical people rot away and die. ||3||<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I have obtained this fruit, the Support of the One Name alone. ||4||<BR>
 No one is strong, and no one is weak; all are manifestations of Your Light, Lord. ||5||<BR>
 You are the all-powerful, indescribable, unfathomable, all-pervading Lord. ||6||<BR>
 Who can estimate Your value, O Creator Lord? God has no end or limitation. ||7||<BR>
 Please bless Nanak with the glorious greatness of the gift of the Naam, and the dust of the feet of Your Saints. ||8||3||8||22||<BR>

 Raamkalee, Third Mehl, Anand ~ The Song Of Bliss:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 I am in ecstasy, O my mother, for I have found my True Guru.<BR>
 I have found the True Guru, with intuitive ease, and my mind vibrates with the music of bliss.<BR>
 The jewelled melodies and their related celestial harmonies have come to sing the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 The Lord dwells within the minds of those who sing the Shabad.<BR>
 Says Nanak, I am in ecstasy, for I have found my True Guru. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, remain always with the Lord.<BR>
 Remain always with the Lord, O my mind, and all sufferings will be forgotten.<BR>
 He will accept You as His own, and all your affairs will be perfectly arranged.<BR>
 Our Lord and Master is all-powerful to do all things, so why forget Him from your mind?<BR>
 Says Nanak, O my mind, remain always with the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 O my True Lord and Master, what is there which is not in Your celestial home?<BR>
 Everything is in Your home; they receive, unto whom You give.<BR>
 Constantly singing Your Praises and Glories, Your Name is enshrined in the mind.<BR>
 The divine melody of the Shabad vibrates for those, within whose minds the Naam abides.<BR>
 Says Nanak, O my True Lord and Master, what is there which is not in Your home? ||3||<BR>
 The True Name is my only support.<BR>
 The True Name is my only support; it satisfies all hunger.<BR>
 It has brought peace and tranquility to my mind; it has fulfilled all my desires.<BR>
 I am forever a sacrifice to the Guru, who possesses such glorious greatness.<BR>
 Says Nanak, listen, O Saints; enshrine love for the Shabad.<BR>
 The True Name is my only support. ||4||<BR>
 The Panch Shabad, the five primal sounds, vibrate in that blessed house.<BR>
 In that blessed house, the Shabad vibrates; He infuses His almighty power into it.<BR>
 Through You, we subdue the five demons of desire, and slay Death, the torturer.<BR>
 Those who have such pre-ordained destiny are attached to the Lord's Name.<BR>
 Says Nanak, they are at peace, and the unstruck sound current vibrates within their homes. ||5||<BR>
 Without the true love of devotion, the body is without honor.<BR>
 The body is dishonored without devotional love; what can the poor wretches do?<BR>
 No one except You is all-powerful; please bestow Your Mercy, O Lord of all nature.<BR>
 There is no place of rest, other than the Name; attached to the Shabad, we are embellished with beauty.<BR>
 Says Nanak, without devotional love, what can the poor wretches do? ||6||<BR>
 Bliss, bliss - everyone talks of bliss; bliss is known only through the Guru.<BR>
 Eternal bliss in known only through the Guru, when the Beloved Lord grants His Grace.<BR>
 Granting His Grace, He cuts away our sins; He blesses us with the healing ointment of spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 Those who eradicate attachment from within themselves, are adorned with the Shabad, the Word of the True Lord.<BR>
 Says Nanak, this alone is bliss - bliss which is known through the Guru. ||7||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 043</H2></CENTER>
 O Baba, he alone receives it, unto whom You give it.<BR>
 He alone receives it, unto whom You give it; what can the other poor wretched beings do?<BR>
 Some are deluded by doubt, wandering in the ten directions; some are adorned with attachment to the Naam.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, the mind becomes immaculate and pure, for those who follow God's Will.<BR>
 Says Nanak, he alone receives it, unto whom You give it, O Beloved Lord. ||8||<BR>
 Come, Beloved Saints, let us speak the Unspoken Speech of the Lord.<BR>
 How can we speak the Unspoken Speech of the Lord? Through which door will we find Him?<BR>
 Surrender body, mind, wealth, and everything to the Guru; obey the Order of His Will, and you will find Him.<BR>
 Obey the Hukam of the Guru's Command, and sing the True Word of His Bani.<BR>
 Says Nanak, listen, O Saints, and speak the Unspoken Speech of the Lord. ||9||<BR>
 O fickle mind, through cleverness, no one has found the Lord.<BR>
 Through cleverness, no one has found Him; listen, O my mind.<BR>
 This Maya is so fascinating; because of it, people wander in doubt.<BR>
 This fascinating Maya was created by the One who has administered this potion.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to the One who has made emotional attachment sweet.<BR>
 Says Nanak, O fickle mind, no one has found Him through cleverness. ||10||<BR>
 O beloved mind, contemplate the True Lord forever.<BR>
 This family which you see shall not go along with you.<BR>
 They shall not go along with you, so why do you focus your attention on them?<BR>
 Don't do anything that you will regret in the end.<BR>
 Listen to the Teachings of the True Guru - these shall go along with you.<BR>
 Says Nanak, O beloved mind, contemplate the True Lord forever. ||11||<BR>
 O inaccessible and unfathomable Lord, Your limits cannot be found.<BR>
 No one has found Your limits; only You Yourself know.<BR>
 All living beings and creatures are Your play; how can anyone describe You?<BR>
 You speak, and You gaze upon all; You created the Universe.<BR>
 Says Nanak, You are forever inaccessible; Your limits cannot be found. ||12||<BR>
 The angelic beings and the silent sages search for the Ambrosial Nectar; this Amrit is obtained from the Guru.<BR>
 This Amrit is obtained, when the Guru grants His Grace; He enshrines the True Lord within the mind.<BR>
 All living beings and creatures were created by You; only some come to see the Guru, and seek His blessing.<BR>
 Their greed, avarice and egotism are dispelled, and the True Guru seems sweet.<BR>
 Says Nanak, those with whom the Lord is pleased, obtain the Amrit, through the Guru. ||13||<BR>
 The lifestyle of the devotees is unique and distinct.<BR>
 The devotees' lifestyle is unique and distinct; they follow the most difficult path.<BR>
 They renounce greed, avarice, egotism and desire; they do not talk too much.<BR>
 The path they take is sharper than a two-edged sword, and finer than a hair.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 044</H2></CENTER>
 By Guru's Grace, they shed their selfishness and conceit; their hopes are merged in the Lord.<BR>
 Says Nanak, the lifestyle of the devotees, in each and every age, is unique and distinct. ||14||<BR>
 As You make me walk, so do I walk, O my Lord and Master; what else do I know of Your Glorious Virtues?<BR>
 As You cause them to walk, they walk - You have placed them on the Path.<BR>
 In Your Mercy, You attach them to the Naam; they meditate forever on the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 Those whom You cause to listen to Your sermon, find peace in the Gurdwara, the Guru's Gate.<BR>
 Says Nanak, O my True Lord and Master, you make us walk according to Your Will. ||15||<BR>
 This song of praise is the Shabad, the most beautiful Word of God.<BR>
 This beauteous Shabad is the everlasting song of praise, spoken by the True Guru.<BR>
 This is enshrined in the minds of those who are so pre-destined by the Lord.<BR>
 Some wander around, babbling on and on, but none obtain Him by babbling.<BR>
 Says Nanak, the Shabad, this song of praise, has been spoken by the True Guru. ||16||<BR>
 Those humble beings who meditate on the Lord become pure.<BR>
 Meditating on the Lord, they become pure; as Gurmukh, they meditate on Him.<BR>
 They are pure, along with their mothers, fathers, family and friends; all their companions are pure as well.<BR>
 Pure are those who speak, and pure are those who listen; those who enshrine it within their minds are pure.<BR>
 Says Nanak, pure and holy are those who, as Gurmukh, meditate on the Lord, Har, Har. ||17||<BR>
 By religious rituals, intuitive poise is not found; without intuitive poise, skepticism does not depart.<BR>
 Skepticism does not depart by contrived actions; everybody is tired of performing these rituals.<BR>
 The soul is polluted by skepticism; how can it be cleansed?<BR>
 Wash your mind by attaching it to the Shabad, and keep your consciousness focused on the Lord.<BR>
 Says Nanak, by Guru's Grace, intuitive poise is produced, and this skepticism is dispelled. ||18||<BR>
 Inwardly polluted, and outwardly pure.<BR>
 Those who are outwardly pure and yet polluted within, lose their lives in the gamble.<BR>
 They contract this terrible disease of desire, and in their minds, they forget about dying.<BR>
 In the Vedas, the ultimate objective is the Naam, the Name of the Lord; but they do not hear this, and they wander around like demons.<BR>
 Says Nanak, those who forsake Truth and cling to falsehood, lose their lives in the gamble. ||19||<BR>
 Inwardly pure, and outwardly pure.<BR>
 Those who are outwardly pure and also pure within, through the Guru, perform good deeds.<BR>
 Not even an iota of falsehood touches them; their hopes are absorbed in the Truth.<BR>
 Those who earn the jewel of this human life, are the most excellent of merchants.<BR>
 Says Nanak, those whose minds are pure, abide with the Guru forever. ||20||<BR>
 If a Sikh turns to the Guru with sincere faith, as sunmukh<BR>
 - if a Sikh turns to the Guru with sincere faith, as sunmukh, his soul abides with the Guru.<BR>
 Within his heart, he meditates on the lotus feet of the Guru; deep within his soul, he contemplates Him.<BR>
 Renouncing selfishness and conceit, he remains always on the side of the Guru; he does not know anyone except the Guru.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 045</H2></CENTER>
 Says Nanak, listen, O Saints: such a Sikh turns toward the Guru with sincere faith, and becomes sunmukh. ||21||<BR>
 One who turns away from the Guru, and becomes baymukh - without the True Guru, he shall not find liberation.<BR>
 He shall not find liberation anywhere else either; go and ask the wise ones about this.<BR>
 He shall wander through countless incarnations; without the True Guru, he shall not find liberation.<BR>
 But liberation is attained, when one is attached to the feet of the True Guru, chanting the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 Says Nanak, contemplate this and see, that without the True Guru, there is no liberation. ||22||<BR>
 Come, O beloved Sikhs of the True Guru, and sing the True Word of His Bani.<BR>
 Sing the Guru's Bani, the supreme Word of Words.<BR>
 Those who are blessed by the Lord's Glance of Grace - their hearts are imbued with this Bani.<BR>
 Drink in this Ambrosial Nectar, and remain in the Lord's Love forever; meditate on the Lord, the Sustainer of the world.<BR>
 Says Nanak, sing this True Bani forever. ||23||<BR>
 Without the True Guru, other songs are false.<BR>
 The songs are false without the True Guru; all other songs are false.<BR>
 The speakers are false, and the listeners are false; those who speak and recite are false.<BR>
 They may continually chant, 'Har, Har' with their tongues, but they do not know what they are saying.<BR>
 Their consciousness is lured by Maya; they are just reciting mechanically.<BR>
 Says Nanak, without the True Guru, other songs are false. ||24||<BR>
 The Word of the Guru's Shabad is a jewel, studded with diamonds.<BR>
 The mind which is attached to this jewel, merges into the Shabad.<BR>
 One whose mind is attuned to the Shabad, enshrines love for the True Lord.<BR>
 He Himself is the diamond, and He Himself is the jewel; one who is blessed, understands its value.<BR>
 Says Nanak, the Shabad is a jewel, studded with diamonds. ||25||<BR>
 He Himself created Shiva and Shakti, mind and matter; the Creator subjects them to His Command.<BR>
 Enforcing His Order, He Himself sees all. How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, come to know Him.<BR>
 They break their bonds, and attain liberation; they enshrine the Shabad within their minds.<BR>
 Those whom the Lord Himself makes Gurmukh, lovingly focus their consciousness on the One Lord.<BR>
 Says Nanak, He Himself is the Creator; He Himself reveals the Hukam of His Command. ||26||<BR>
 The Simritees and the Shaastras discriminate between good and evil, but they do not know the true essence of reality.<BR>
 They do not know the true essence of reality without the Guru; they do not know the true essence of reality.<BR>
 The world is asleep in the three modes and doubt; it passes the night of its life sleeping.<BR>
 Those humble beings remain awake and aware, within whose minds, by Guru's Grace, the Lord abides; they chant the Ambrosial Word of the Guru's Bani.<BR>
 Says Nanak, they alone obtain the essence of reality, who night and day remain lovingly absorbed in the Lord; they pass the night of their life awake and aware. ||27||<BR>
 He nourished us in the mother's womb; why forget Him from the mind?<BR>
 Why forget from the mind such a Great Giver, who gave us sustenance in the fire of the womb?<BR>
 Nothing can harm one, whom the Lord inspires to embrace His Love.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 046</H2></CENTER>
 He Himself is the love, and He Himself is the embrace; the Gurmukh contemplates Him forever.<BR>
 Says Nanak, why forget such a Great Giver from the mind? ||28||<BR>
 As is the fire within the womb, so is Maya outside.<BR>
 The fire of Maya is one and the same; the Creator has staged this play.<BR>
 According to His Will, the child is born, and the family is very pleased.<BR>
 Love for the Lord wears off, and the child becomes attached to desires; the script of Maya runs its course.<BR>
 This is Maya, by which the Lord is forgotten; emotional attachment and love of duality well up.<BR>
 Says Nanak, by Guru's Grace, those who enshrine love for the Lord find Him, in the midst of Maya. ||29||<BR>
 The Lord Himself is priceless; His worth cannot be estimated.<BR>
 His worth cannot be estimated, even though people have grown weary of trying.<BR>
 If you meet such a True Guru, offer your head to Him; your selfishness and conceit will be eradicated from within.<BR>
 Your soul belongs to Him; remain united with Him, and the Lord will come to dwell in your mind.<BR>
 The Lord Himself is priceless; very fortunate are those, O Nanak, who attain to the Lord. ||30||<BR>
 The Lord is my capital; my mind is the merchant.<BR>
 The Lord is my capital, and my mind is the merchant; through the True Guru, I know my capital.<BR>
 Meditate continually on the Lord, Har, Har, O my soul, and you shall collect your profits daily.<BR>
 This wealth is obtained by those who are pleasing to the Lord's Will.<BR>
 Says Nanak, the Lord is my capital, and my mind is the merchant. ||31||<BR>
 O my tongue, you are engrossed in other tastes, but your thirsty desire is not quenched.<BR>
 Your thirst shall not be quenched by any means, until you attain the subtle essence of the Lord.<BR>
 If you do obtain the subtle essence of the Lord, and drink in this essence of the Lord, you shall not be troubled by desire again.<BR>
 This subtle essence of the Lord is obtained by good karma, when one comes to meet with the True Guru.<BR>
 Says Nanak, all other tastes and essences are forgotten, when the Lord comes to dwell within the mind. ||32||<BR>
 O my body, the Lord infused His Light into you, and then you came into the world.<BR>
 The Lord infused His Light into you, and then you came into the world.<BR>
 The Lord Himself is your mother, and He Himself is your father; He created the created beings, and revealed the world to them.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, some understand, and then it's a show; it seems like just a show.<BR>
 Says Nanak, He laid the foundation of the Universe, and infused His Light, and then you came into the world. ||33||<BR>
 My mind has become joyful, hearing of God's coming.<BR>
 Sing the songs of joy to welcome the Lord, O my companions; my household has become the Lord's Mansion.<BR>
 Sing continually the songs of joy to welcome the Lord, O my companions, and sorrow and suffering will not afflict you.<BR>
 Blessed is that day, when I am attached to the Guru's feet and meditate on my Husband Lord.<BR>
 I have come to know the unstruck sound current and the Word of the Guru's Shabad; I enjoy the sublime essence of the Lord, the Lord's Name.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 047</H2></CENTER>
 Says Nanak, God Himself has met me; He is the Doer, the Cause of causes. ||34||<BR>
 O my body, why have you come into this world? What actions have you committed?<BR>
 And what actions have you committed, O my body, since you came into this world?<BR>
 The Lord who formed your form - you have not enshrined that Lord in your mind.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, the Lord abides within the mind, and one's pre-ordained destiny is fulfilled.<BR>
 Says Nanak, this body is adorned and honored, when one's consciousness is focused on the True Guru. ||35||<BR>
 O my eyes, the Lord has infused His Light into you; do not look upon any other than the Lord.<BR>
 Do not look upon any other than the Lord; the Lord alone is worthy of beholding.<BR>
 This whole world which you see is the image of the Lord; only the image of the Lord is seen.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, I understand, and I see only the One Lord; there is no one except the Lord.<BR>
 Says Nanak, these eyes were blind; but meeting the True Guru, they became all-seeing. ||36||<BR>
 O my ears, you were created only to hear the Truth.<BR>
 To hear the Truth, you were created and attached to the body; listen to the True Bani.<BR>
 Hearing it, the mind and body are rejuvenated, and the tongue is absorbed in Ambrosial Nectar.<BR>
 The True Lord is unseen and wondrous; His state cannot be described.<BR>
 Says Nanak, listen to the Ambrosial Naam and become holy; you were created only to hear the Truth. ||37||<BR>
 The Lord placed the soul to the cave of the body, and blew the breath of life into the musical instrument of the body.<BR>
 He blew the breath of life into the musical instrument of the body, and revealed the nine doors; but He kept the Tenth Door hidden.<BR>
 Through the Gurdwara, the Guru's Gate, some are blessed with loving faith, and the Tenth Door is revealed to them.<BR>
 There are many images of the Lord, and the nine treasures of the Naam; His limits cannot be found.<BR>
 Says Nanak, the Lord placed the soul to the cave of the body, and blew the breath of life into the musical instrument of the body. ||38||<BR>
 Sing this true song of praise in the true home of your soul.<BR>
 Sing the song of praise in your true home; meditate there on the True Lord forever.<BR>
 They alone meditate on You, O True Lord, who are pleasing to Your Will; as Gurmukh, they understand.<BR>
 This Truth is the Lord and Master of all; whoever is blessed, obtains it.<BR>
 Says Nanak, sing the true song of praise in the true home of your soul. ||39||<BR>
 Listen to the song of bliss, O most fortunate ones; all your longings shall be fulfilled.<BR>
 I have obtained the Supreme Lord God, and all sorrows have been forgotten.<BR>
 Pain, illness and suffering have departed, listening to the True Bani.<BR>
 The Saints and their friends are in ecstasy, knowing the Perfect Guru.<BR>
 Pure are the listeners, and pure are the speakers; the True Guru is all-pervading and permeating.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, touching the Guru's Feet, the unstruck sound current of the celestial bugles vibrates and resounds. ||40||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 048</H2></CENTER>
 Raamkalee, Sadd ~ The Call Of Death:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 He is the Great Giver of the Universe, the Lover of His devotees, throughout the three worlds.<BR>
 One who is merged in the Word of the Guru's Shabad does not know any other.<BR>
 Dwelling upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he does not know any other; he meditates on the One Name of the Lord.<BR>
 By the Grace of Guru Nanak and Guru Angad, Guru Amar Das obtained the supreme status.<BR>
 And when the call came for Him to depart, He merged in the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Through devotional worship in this world, the imperishable, immovable, immeasurable Lord is found. ||1||<BR>
 The Guru gladly accepted the Lord's Will, and so the Guru easily reached the Lord God's Presence.<BR>
 The True Guru prays to the Lord, "Please, save my honor. This is my prayer".<BR>
 Please save the honor of Your humble servant, O Lord; please bless him with Your Immaculate Name.<BR>
 At this time of final departure, it is our only help and support; it destroys death, and the Messenger of Death.<BR>
 The Lord God heard the prayer of the True Guru, and granted His request.<BR>
 The Lord showered His Mercy, and blended the True Guru with Himself; He said, "Blessed! Blessed! Wonderful!"||2||<BR>
 Listen O my Sikhs, my children and Siblings of Destiny; it is my Lord's Will that I must now go to Him.<BR>
 The Guru gladly accepted the Lord's Will, and my Lord God applauded Him.<BR>
 One who is pleased with the Lord God's Will is a devotee, the True Guru, the Primal Lord.<BR>
 The unstruck sound current of bliss resounds and vibrates; the Lord hugs him close in His embrace.<BR>
 O my children, siblings and family, look carefully in your minds, and see.<BR>
 The pre-ordained death warrant cannot be avoided; the Guru is going to be with the Lord God. ||3||<BR>
 The True Guru, in His Own Sweet Will, sat up and summoned His family.<BR>
 Let no one weep for me after I am gone. That would not please me at all.<BR>
 When a friend receives a robe of honor, then his friends are pleased with his honor.<BR>
 Consider this and see, O my children and siblings; the Lord has given the True Guru the robe of supreme honor.<BR>
 The True Guru Himself sat up, and appointed the successor to the Throne of Raja Yoga, the Yoga of Meditation and Success.<BR>
 All the Sikhs, relatives, children and siblings have fallen at the Feet of Guru Ram Das. ||4||<BR>
 Finally, the True Guru said, "When I am gone, sing Kirtan in Praise of the Lord, in Nirvaanaa."<BR>
 Call in the long-haired scholarly Saints of the Lord, to read the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 Read the sermon of the Lord, and listen to the Lord's Name; the Guru is pleased with love for the Lord.<BR>
 Do not bother with offering rice-balls on leaves, lighting lamps, and other rituals like floating the body out on the Ganges; instead, let my remains be given up to the Lord's Pool.<BR>
 The Lord was pleased as the True Guru spoke; he was blended then with the all-knowing Primal Lord God.<BR>
 The Guru then blessed the Sodhi Ram Das with the ceremonial tilak mark, the insignia of the True Word of the Shabad. ||5||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 049</H2></CENTER>
 And as the True Guru, the Primal Lord spoke, and the Gursikhs obeyed His Will.<BR>
 His son Mohri turned sunmukh, and become obedient to Him; he bowed, and touched Ram Das' feet.<BR>
 Then, everyone bowed and touched the feet of Ram Das, into whom the Guru infused His essence.<BR>
 And any that did not bow then because of envy - later, the True Guru brought them around to bow in humility.<BR>
 It pleased the Guru, the Lord, to bestow glorious greatness upon Him; such was the pre-ordained destiny of the Lord's Will.<BR>
 Says Sundar, listen, O Saints: all the world fell at His feet. ||6||1||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl, Chhant:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Friend, my Friend - standing so near to me is my Friend!<BR>
 Beloved, the Lord my Beloved - with my eyes, I have seen the Lord, my Beloved!<BR>
 With my eyes I have seen Him, sleeping upon the bed within each and every heart; my Beloved is the sweetest ambrosial nectar.<BR>
 He is with all, but he cannot be found; the fool does not know His taste.<BR>
 Intoxicated with the wine of Maya, the mortal babbles on about trivial affairs; giving in to the illusion, he cannot meet the Lord.<BR>
 Says Nanak, without the Guru, he cannot understand the Lord, the Friend who is standing near everyone. ||1||<BR>
 God, my God - the Support of the breath of life is my God.<BR>
 Merciful Lord, my Merciful Lord - the Giver of gifts is my Merciful Lord.<BR>
 The Giver of gifts is infinite and unlimited; deep within each and every heart, He is so beautiful!<BR>
 He created Maya, His slave, so powerfully pervasive - she has enticed all beings and creatures.<BR>
 One whom the Lord saves, chants the True Name, and contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 Says Nanak, one who is pleasing to God - God is very dear to him. ||2||<BR>
 I take pride, I take pride in God; I take pride in my God.<BR>
 Wise, God is wise; my Lord and Master is all-wise, and all-knowing.<BR>
 All-wise and all-knowing, and forever supreme; the Name of the Lord is Ambrosial Nectar.<BR>
 Those who have such pre-ordained destiny recorded upon their foreheads, taste it, and are satisfied with the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 They meditate on Him, and find Him; they place all their pride in Him.<BR>
 Says Nanak, He is seated on His eternal throne; True is His royal court. ||3||<BR>
 The song of joy, the Lord's song of joy; listen to the song of joy of my God.<BR>
 The wedding song, God's wedding song; the unstruck sound current of His wedding song resounds.<BR>
 The unstruck sound current vibrates, and the Word of the Shabad resounds; there is continuous, continual rejoicing.<BR>
 Meditating on that God, everything is obtained; He does not die, or come or go.<BR>
 Thirst is quenched, and hopes are fulfilled; the Gurmukh meets with the absolute, unmanifest Lord.<BR>
 Says Nanak, in the Home of my God, the songs of joy are continuously, continually heard. ||4||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 050</H2></CENTER>
 Raamkalee Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, O mind; don't forget Him, even for an instant.<BR>
 Enshrine the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam, Raam, within your heart and throat.<BR>
 Enshrine within your heart the Primal Lord, Har, Har, the all-pervading, supreme, immaculate Lord God.<BR>
 He sends fear far away; He is the Destroyer of sin; He eradicates the unbearable pains of the terrifying world-ocean.<BR>
 Contemplate the Lord of the World, the Cherisher of the World, the Lord, the Virtuous Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, remember the Lord, day and night. ||1||<BR>
 His lotus feet are the support and anchor of His humble servants.<BR>
 He takes the Naam, the Name of the Infinite Lord, as his wealth, property and treasure.<BR>
 Those who have the treasure of the Lord's Name, enjoy the taste of the One Lord.<BR>
 They meditate on the Infinite Lord with each and every breath, as their pleasure, joy and beauty.<BR>
 The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the Destroyer of sins, the only deed of redemption. The Naam drives out the fear of the Messenger of Death.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, the support of His lotus feet is the capital of His humble servant. ||2||<BR>
 Your Glorious Virtues are endless, O my Lord and Master; no one knows them all.<BR>
 Seeing and hearing of Your wondrous plays, O Merciful Lord, Your devotees narrate them.<BR>
 All beings and creatures meditate on You, O Primal Transcendent Lord, Master of men.<BR>
 All beings are beggars; You are the One Giver, O Lord of the Universe, Embodiment of mercy.<BR>
 He alone is holy, a Saint, a truly wise person, who is accepted by the Dear Lord.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, they alone realize You, unto whom You show Mercy. ||3||<BR>
 I am unworthy and without any master; I seek Your Sanctuary, Lord.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Divine Guru, who has implanted the Naam within me.<BR>
 The Guru blessed me with the Naam; happiness came, and all my desires were fulfilled.<BR>
 The fire of desire has been quenched, and peace and tranquility have come; after such a long separation, I have met my Lord again.<BR>
 I have found ecstasy, pleasure and true intuitive poise, singing the great glories, the song of bliss of the Lord.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, I have obtained the Name of God from the Perfect Guru. ||4||2||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Rise early each morning, and with the Saints, sing the melodious harmony, the unstruck sound current of the Shabad.<BR>
 All sins and sufferings are erased, chanting the Lord's Name, under Guru's Instructions.<BR>
 Dwell upon the Lord's Name, and drink in the Nectar; day and night, worship and adore Him.<BR>
 The merits of Yoga, charity and religious rituals are obtained by grasping His lotus feet.<BR>
 Loving devotion to the merciful, enticing Lord takes away all pain.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, cross over the world-ocean, meditating on the Lord, your Lord and Master. ||1||<BR>
 Meditation on the Lord of the Universe is an ocean of peace; Your devotees sing Your Glorious Praises, Lord.<BR>
 Ecstasy, bliss and great happiness are obtained by grasping hold of the Guru's feet.<BR>
 Meeting with the treasure of peace, their pains are taken away; granting His Grace, God protects them.<BR>
 Those who grasp the Lord's feet - their fears and doubts run away, and they chant the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 He thinks of the One Lord, and he sings of the One God; he gazes upon the One Lord alone.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 051</H2></CENTER>
 Prays Nanak, God has granted His Grace, and I have found the Perfect True Guru. ||2||<BR>

 God saves His humble devotees, attaching them to His feet.<BR>
 Twenty-four hours a day, they meditate in remembrance on their God; they meditae on the One Name.<BR>
 Meditating on that God, they cross over the terrifying world-ocean, and their comings and goings cease.<BR>
 They enjoy eternal peace and pleasure, singing the Kirtan of God's Praises; His Will seems so sweet to them.<BR>

 Without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, one dies wandering around in confusion, performing all sorts of rituals.<BR>

 Those who are pleasing to God are united with Him; He separates others from Himself.<BR>
 Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of God; His greatness is glorious! ||2||<BR>
 Chhant:<BR>
 In the summer season, in the months of Jayt'h and Asaarh, the heat is terrible, intense and severe.<BR>
 The discarded bride is separated from His Love, and the Lord does not even look at her.<BR>
 She does not see her Lord, and she dies with an aching sigh; she is defrauded and plundered by her great pride.<BR>
 She flails around, like a fish out of water; attached to Maya, she is alienated from the Lord.<BR>
 She sins, and so she is fearful of reincarnation; the Messenger of Death will surely punish her.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, take me under Your sheltering support, Lord, and protect me; You are the Fulfiller of desire. ||3||<BR>
 Shalok:<BR>
 With loving faith, I am attached to my Beloved; I cannot survive without Him, even for an instant.<BR>
 He is permeating and pervading my mind and body, O Nanak, with intuitive ease. ||1||<BR>

 Thirsty with desire, I wander around; when will I behold the Lord of the World?<BR>

 Entering the Sanctuary of the Lord's Holy Saints, O Nanak, my desires are fulfilled. ||2||<BR>
 Chhant:<BR>
 In the cool, autumn season, in the months of Assu and Katik, I am thirsty for the Lord.<BR>
 Searching for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, I wander around wondering, when will I meet my Lord, the treasure of virtue?<BR>
 Without my Beloved Husband Lord, I find no peace, and all my necklaces and bracelets become cursed.<BR>
 So beautiful, so wise, so clever and knowing; still, without the breath, it is just a body.<BR>

 All my desires have been fulfilled, meeting the Lord face-to-face; I am His servant, I serve at His feet.<BR>
 My necklaces, hair-ties, all decorations and adornments, are in singing the Glorious Praises of the unseen, mysterious Lord.<BR>
 I long for loving devotion to the Lord of the Universe, and so the Messenger of Death cannot even see me.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, God has united me with Himself; I shall never suffer separation from my Beloved again. ||6||<BR>
 Shalok:<BR>
 The happy soul bride has found the wealth of the Lord; her consciousness does not waver.<BR>
 Joining together with the Saints, O Nanak, God, my Friend, has revealed Himself in my home. ||1||<BR>
 With her Beloved Husband Lord, she enjoys millions of melodies, pleasures and joys.<BR>
 The fruits of the mind's desires are obtained, O Nanak, chanting the Lord's Name. ||2||<BR>
 Chhant:<BR>
 The snowy winter season, the months of Maagh and Phagun, are pleasing and ennobling to the mind.<BR>
 O my friends and companions, sing the songs of joy; my Husband Lord has come into my home.<BR>
 My Beloved has come into my home; I meditate on Him in my mind. The bed of my heart is beautifully adorned.<BR>
 The woods, the meadows and the three worlds have blossomed forth in their greenery; gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, I am fascinated.<BR>
 I have met my Lord and Master, and my desires are fulfilled; my mind chants His Immaculate Mantra.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, I celebrate continuously; I have met my Husband Lord, the Lord of excellence. ||7||<BR>
 Shalok:<BR>
 The Saints are the helpers, the support of the soul; they carry us cross the terrifying world-ocean.<BR>
 Know that they are the highest of all; O Nanak, they love the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Those who know Him, cross over; they are the brave heroes, the heroic warriors.<BR>
 Nanak is a sacrifice to those who meditate on the Lord, and cross over to the other shore. ||2||<BR>
 Chhant:<BR>
 His feet are exalted above all. They eradicate all suffering.<BR>
 They destroy the pains of coming and going. They bring loving devotion to the Lord.<BR>
 Imbued with the Lord's Love, one is intoxicated with intuitive peace and poise, and does not forget the Lord from his mind, even for an instant.<BR>
 Shedding my self-conceit, I have entered the Sanctuary of His Feet; all virtues rest in the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 I bow in humility to the Lord of the Universe, the treasure of virtue, the Lord of excellence, our Primal Lord and Master.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, shower me with Your Mercy, Lord; throughout the ages, You take the same form. ||8||1||6||8||<BR>
 Raamkalee, First Mehl, Dakhanee, Ongkaar:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 From Ongkaar, the One Universal Creator God, Brahma was created.<BR>
 He kept Ongkaar in his consciousness.<BR>
 From Ongkaar, the mountains and the ages were created.<BR>
 Ongkaar created the Vedas.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 055</H2></CENTER>
 Ongkaar saves the world through the Shabad.<BR>
 Ongkaar saves the Gurmukhs.<BR>
 Listen to the Message of the Universal, Imperishable Creator Lord.<BR>
 The Universal, Imperishable Creator Lord is the essence of the three worlds. ||1||<BR>
 Listen, O Pandit, O religious scholar, why are you writing about worldly debates?<BR>
 As Gurmukh, write only the Name of the Lord, the Lord of the World. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Sassa: He created the entire universe with ease; His One Light pervades the three worlds.<BR>
 Become Gurmukh, and obtain the real thing; gather the gems and pearls.<BR>
 If one understands, realizes and comprehends what he reads and studies, in the end he shall realize that the True Lord dwells deep within his nucleus.<BR>
 The Gurmukh sees and contemplates the True Lord; without the True Lord, the world is false. ||2||<BR>
 Dhadha: Those who enshrine Dharmic faith and dwell in the City of Dharma are worthy; their minds are steadfast and stable.<BR>
 Dhadha: If the dust of their feet touches one's face and forehead, he is transformed from iron into gold.<BR>
 Blessed is the Support of the Earth; He Himself is not born; His measure and speech are perfect and True.<BR>
 Only the Creator Himself knows His own extent; He alone knows the Brave Guru. ||3||<BR>
 In love with duality, spiritual wisdom is lost; the mortal rots away in pride, and eats poison.<BR>
 He thinks that the sublime essence of the Guru's song is useless, and he does not like to hear it. He loses the profound, unfathomable Lord.<BR>
 Through the Guru's Words of Truth, the Ambrosial Nectar is obtained, and the mind and body find joy in the True Lord.<BR>
 He Himself is the Gurmukh, and He Himself bestows the Ambrosial Nectar; He Himself leads us to drink it in. ||4||<BR>
 Everyone says that God is the One and only, but they are engrossed in egotism and pride.<BR>
 Realize that the One God is inside and outside; understand this, that the Mansion of His Presence is within the home of your heart.<BR>
 God is near at hand; do not think that God is far away. The One Lord permeates the entire universe.<BR>
 There in One Universal Creator Lord; there is no other at all. O Nanak, merge into the One Lord. ||5||<BR>
 How can you keep the Creator under your control? He cannot be seized or measured.<BR>
 Maya has made the mortal insane; she has administered the poisonous drug of falsehood.<BR>
 Addicted to greed and avarice, the mortal is ruined, and then later, he regrets and repents.<BR>
 So serve the One Lord, and attain the state of Salvation; your comings and goings shall cease. ||6||<BR>
 The One Lord is in all actions, colors and forms.<BR>
 He manifests in many shapes through wind, water and fire.<BR>
 The One Soul wanders through the three worlds.<BR>
 One who understands and comprehends the One Lord is honored.<BR>
 One who gathers in spiritual wisdom and meditation, dwells in the state of balance.<BR>
 How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, attain the One Lord.<BR>
 They alone find peace, whom the Lord blesses with His Grace.<BR>
 In the Gurdwara, the Guru's Door, they speak and hear of the Lord. ||7||<BR>
 His Light illuminates the ocean and the earth.<BR>
 Throughout the three worlds, is the Guru, the Lord of the World.<BR>
 The Lord reveals His various forms;<BR>
 granting His Grace, He enters the home of the heart.<BR>
 The clouds hang low, and the rain is pouring down.<BR>
 The Lord embellishes and exalts with the Sublime Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 One who knows the mystery of the One God,<BR>
 is Himself the Creator, Himself the Divine Lord. ||8||<BR>
 When the sun rises, the demons are slain;<BR>
 the mortal looks upwards, and contemplates the Shabad.<BR>
 The Lord is beyond the beginning and the end, beyond the three worlds.<BR>
 He Himself acts, speaks and listens.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 056</H2></CENTER>
 He is the Architect of Destiny; He blesses us with mind and body.<BR>
 That Architect of Destiny is in my mind and mouth.<BR>
 God is the Life of the world; there is no other at all.<BR>
 O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one is honored. ||9||<BR>
 One who lovingly chants the Name of the Sovereign Lord King,<BR>
 fights the battle and conquers his own mind;<BR>
 day and night, he remains imbued with the Lord's Love.<BR>
 He is famous throughout the three worlds and the four ages.<BR>
 One who knows the Lord, becomes like Him.<BR>
 He becomes absolutely immaculate, and his body is sanctified.<BR>
 His heart is happy, in love with the One Lord.<BR>
 He lovingly centers his attention deep within upon the True Word of the Shabad. ||10||<BR>
 Don't be angry - drink in the Ambrosial Nectar; you shall not remain in this world forever.<BR>
 The ruling kings and the paupers shall not remain; they come and go, throughout the four ages.<BR>
 Everyone says that they will remain, but none of them remain; unto whom should I offer my prayer?<BR>
 The One Shabad, the Name of the Lord, will never fail you; the Guru grants honor and understanding. ||11||<BR>
 My shyness and hesitation have died and gone, and I walk with my face unveiled.<BR>
 The confusion and doubt from my crazy, insane mother-in-law has been removed from over my head.<BR>
 My Beloved has summoned me with joyful caresses; my mind is filled with the bliss of the Shabad.<BR>
 Imbued with the Love of my Beloved, I have become Gurmukh, and carefree. ||12||<BR>
 Chant the jewel of the Naam, and earn the profit of the Lord.<BR>
 Greed, avarice, evil and egotism;<BR>
 slander, inuendo and gossip;<BR>
 the self-willed manmukh is blind, foolish and ignorant.<BR>
 For the sake of earning the profit of the Lord, the mortal comes into the world.<BR>
 But he becomes a mere slave laborer, and is mugged by the mugger, Maya.<BR>
 One who earns the profit of the Naam, with the capital of faith,<BR>
 O Nanak, is truly honored by the True Supreme King. ||13||<BR>
 The world is ruined on the path of Death.<BR>
 No one has the power to erase Maya's influence.<BR>
 If wealth visits the home of the lowliest clown,<BR>
 seeing that wealth, all pay their respects to him.<BR>
 Even an idiot is thought of as clever, if he is rich.<BR>
 Without devotional worship, the world is insane.<BR>
 The One Lord is contained among all.<BR>
 He reveals Himself, unto those whom He blesses with His Grace. ||14||<BR>
 Throughout the ages, the Lord is eternally established; He has no vengeance.<BR>
 He is not subject to birth and death; He is not entangled in worldly affairs.<BR>
 Whatever is seen, is the Lord Himself.<BR>
 Creating Himself, He establishes Himself in the heart.<BR>
 He Himself is unfathomable; He links people to their affairs.<BR>
 He is the Way of Yoga, the Life of the World.<BR>
 Living a righteous lifestyle, true peace is found.<BR>
 Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, how can anyone find liberation? ||15||<BR>
 Without the Name, even one's own body is an enemy.<BR>
 Why not meet the Lord, and take away the pain of your mind?<BR>
 The traveller comes and goes along the highway.<BR>
 What did he bring when he came, and what will he take away when he goes?<BR>
 Without the Name, one loses everywhere.<BR>
 The profit is earned, when the Lord grants understanding.<BR>
 In merchandise and trade, the merchant is trading.<BR>
 Without the Name, how can one find honor and nobility? ||16||<BR>
 One who contemplates the Lord's Virtues is spiritually wise.<BR>
 Through His Virtues, one receives spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 How rare in this world, is the Giver of virtue.<BR>
 The True way of life comes through contemplation of the Guru.<BR>
 The Lord is inaccessible and unfathomable. His worth cannot be estimated.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 057</H2></CENTER>
 They alone meet Him, whom the Lord causes to meet.<BR>
 The virtuous soul bride continually contemplates His Virtues.<BR>
 O Nanak, following the Guru's Teachings, one meets the Lord, the true friend. ||17||<BR>
 Unfulfilled sexual desire and unresolved anger waste the body away,<BR>
 as gold is dissolved by borax.<BR>
 The gold is touched to the touchstone, and tested by fire;<BR>
 when its pure color shows through, it is pleasing to the eye of the assayer.<BR>
 The world is a beast, and arrogent Death is the butcher.<BR>
 The created beings of the Creator receive the karma of their actions.<BR>
 He who created the world, knows its worth.<BR>
 What else can be said? There is nothing at all to say. ||18||<BR>
 Searching, searching, I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar.<BR>
 I have adopted the way of tolerance, and given my mind to the True Guru.<BR>
 Everyone calls himself true and genuine.<BR>
 He alone is true, who obtains the jewel throughout the four ages.<BR>
 Eating and drinking, one dies, but still does not know.<BR>
 He dies in an instant, when he realizes the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 His consciousness becomes permanently stable, and his mind accepts death.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, he realizes the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||19||<BR>
 The Profound Lord dwells in the sky of the mind, the Tenth Gate;<BR>
 singing His Glorious Praises, one dwells in intuitive poise and peace.<BR>
 He does not go to come, or come to go.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, he remains lovingly focused on the Lord.<BR>
 The Lord of the mind-sky is inaccessible, independent and beyond birth.<BR>
 The most worthy Samaadhi is to keep the consciousness stable, focused on Him.<BR>
 Remembering the Lord's Name, one is not subject to reincarnation.<BR>
 The Guru's Teachings are the most Excellent; all other ways lack the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||20||<BR>
 Wandering to countless doorsteps and homes, I have grown weary.<BR>
 My incarnations are countless, without limit.<BR>
 I have had so many mothers and fathers, sons and daughters.<BR>
 I have had so many gurus and disciples.<BR>
 Through a false guru, liberation is not found.<BR>
 There are so many brides of the One Husband Lord - consider this.<BR>
 The Gurmukh dies, and lives with God.<BR>
 Searching in the ten directions, I found Him within my own home.<BR>
 I have met Him; the True Guru has led me to meet Him. ||21||<BR>
 The Gurmukh sings, and the Gurmukh speaks.<BR>
 The Gurmukh evaluates the value of the Lord, and inspires others to evaluate Him as well.<BR>
 The Gurmukh comes and goes without fear.<BR>
 His filth is taken away, and his stains are burnt off.<BR>
 The Gurmukh contemplates the sound current of the Naad for his Vedas.<BR>
 The Gurmukh's cleansing bath is the performance of good deeds.<BR>
 For the Gurmukh, the Shabad is the most excellent Ambrosial Nectar.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh crosses over. ||22||<BR>
 The fickle consciousness does not remain stable.<BR>
 The deer secretly nibbles at the green sprouts.<BR>
 One who enshrines the Lord's lotus feet in his heart and consciousness<BR>
 lives long, always remembering the Lord.<BR>
 Everyone has worries and cares.<BR>
 He alone finds peace, who thinks of the One Lord.<BR>
 When the Lord dwells in the consciousness, and one is absorbed in the Lord's Name,<BR>
 one is liberated, and returns home with honor. ||23||<BR>
 The body falls apart, when one knot is untied.<BR>
 Behold, the world is on the decline; it will be totally destroyed.<BR>
 Only one who looks alike upon sunshine and shade<BR>
 has his bonds shattered; he is liberated and returns home.<BR>
 Maya is empty and petty; she has defrauded the world.<BR>
 Such destiny is pre-ordained by past actions.<BR>
 Youth is wasting away; old age and death hover above the head.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 058</H2></CENTER>
 The body falls apart, like algae upon the water. ||24||<BR>
 God Himself appears throughout the three worlds.<BR>
 Throughout the ages, He is the Great Giver; there is no other at all.<BR>
 As it pleases You, You protect and preserve us.<BR>
 I ask for the Lord's Praises, which bless me with honor and credit.<BR>
 Remaining awake and aware, I am pleasing to You, O Lord.<BR>
 When You unite me with Yourself, then I am merged in You.<BR>
 I chant Your Victorious Praises, O Life of the World.<BR>
 Accepting the Guru's Teachings, one is sure to merge in the One Lord. ||25||<BR>
 Why do you speak such nonsense, and argue with the world?<BR>
 You shall die repenting, when you see your own insanity.<BR>
 He is born, only to die, but he does not wish to live.<BR>
 He comes hopeful, and then goes, without hope.<BR>
 Regretting, repenting and grieving, he is dust mixing with dust.<BR>
 Death does not chew up one who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<BR>
 The nine treasures are obtained through the Name of the Lord;<BR>
 the Lord bestows intuitive peace and poise. ||26||<BR>
 He speaks spiritual wisdom, and He Himself understands it.<BR>
 He Himself knows it, and He Himself comprehends it.<BR>
 One who takes the Words of the Guru into his very fiber,<BR>
 is immaculate and holy, and is pleasing to the True Lord.<BR>
 In the ocean of the Guru, there is no shortage of pearls.<BR>
 The treasure of jewels is truly inexhaustible.<BR>
 Do those deeds which the Guru has ordained.<BR>
 Why are you chasing after the Guru's actions?<BR>
 O Nanak, through the Guru's Teachings, merge in the True Lord. ||27||<BR>
 Love is broken, when one speaks in defiance.<BR>
 The arm is broken, when it is pulled from both sides.<BR>
 Love breaks, when the speech goes sour.<BR>
 The Husband Lord abandons and leaves behind the evil-minded bride.<BR>
 The broken knot is tied again, through contemplation and meditation.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one's affairs are resolved in one's own home.<BR>
 One who earns the profit of the True Name, will not lose it again;<BR>
 the Lord and Master of the three worlds is your best friend. ||28||<BR>
 Control your mind, and keep it in its place.<BR>
 The world is destroyed by conflict, regretting its sinful mistakes.<BR>
 There is one Husband Lord, and all are His brides.<BR>
 The false bride wears many costumes.<BR>
 He stops her from going into the homes of others;<BR>
 He summons her to the Mansion of His Presence, and no obstacles block her path.<BR>
 She is embellished with the Word of the Shabad, and is loved by the True Lord.<BR>
 She is the happy soul bride, who takes the Support of her Lord and Master. ||29||<BR>
 Wandering and roaming around, O my companion, your beautiful robes are torn.<BR>
 In jealousy, the body is not at peace; without the Fear of God, multitudes are ruined.<BR>
 One who remains dead within her own home, through the Fear of God, is looked upon with favor by her all-knowing Husband Lord.<BR>
 She maintains fear of her Guru, and chants the Name of the Fearless Lord.<BR>
 Living on the mountain, I suffer such great thirst; when I see Him, I know that He is not far away.<BR>
 My thirst is quenched, and I have accepted the Word of the Shabad. I drink my fill of the Ambrosial Nectar.<BR>
 Everyone says, "Give! Give!" As He pleases, He gives.<BR>
 Through the Gurdwara, the Guru's Door, He gives, and quenches the thirst. ||30||<BR>
 Searching and seeking, I fell down and collapsed upon the bank of the river of life.<BR>
 Those who are heavy with sin sink down, but those who are light swim across.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to those who meet the immortal and immeasurable Lord.<BR>
 The dust of their feet brings emancipation; in their company, we are united in the Lord's Union.<BR>
 I gave my mind to my Guru, and received the Immaculate Name.<BR>

 I serve the One who gave me the Naam; I am a sacrifice to Him.<BR>
 He who builds, also demolishes; there is no other than Him.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, I contemplate Him, and then my body does not suffer in pain. ||31||<BR>
 No one is mine - whose gown should I grasp and hold? No one ever was, and no one shall ever be mine.<BR>
 Coming and going, one is ruined, afflicted with the disease of dual-mindedness.<BR>
 Those beings who lack the Naam, the Name of the Lord, collapse like pillars of salt.<BR>
 Without the Name, how can they find release? They fall into hell in the end.<BR>
 Using a limited number of words, we describe the unlimited True Lord.<BR>
 The ignorant lack understanding. Without the Guru, there is no spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 The separated soul is like the broken string of a guitar, which does not vibrate its sound.<BR>
 God unites the separated souls with Himself, awakening their destiny. ||32||<BR>
 The body is the tree, and the mind is the bird; the birds in the tree are the five senses.<BR>
 They peck at the essence of reality, and merge with the One Lord. They are never trapped at all.<BR>
 But the others fly away in a hurry, when they see the food.<BR>
 Their feathers are clipped, and they are caught in the noose; through their mistakes, they are caught in disaster.<BR>
 Without the True Lord, how can anyone find release? The jewel of the Lord's Glorious Praises comes by the karma of good actions.<BR>
 When He Himself releases them, only then are they released. He Himself is the Great Master.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, they are released, when He Himself grants His Grace.<BR>
 Glorious greatness rests in His Hands. He blesses those with whom He is pleased. ||33||<BR>
 The soul trembles and shakes, when it loses its mooring and support.<BR>
 Only the support of the True Lord brings honor and glory. Through it, one's works are never in vain.<BR>
 The Lord is eternal and forever stable; the Guru is stable, and contemplation upon the True Lord is stable.<BR>
 O Lord and Master of angels, men and Yogic masters, You are the support of the unsupported.<BR>
 In all places and interspaces, You are the Giver, the Great Giver.<BR>
 Wherever I look, there I see You, Lord; You have no end or limitation.<BR>
 You are pervading and permeating the places and interspaces; reflecting upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad, You are found.<BR>
 You give gifts even when they are not asked for; You are great, inaccessible and infinite. ||34||<BR>
 O Merciful Lord, You are the embodiment of mercy; creating the Creation, You behold it.<BR>
 Please shower Your Mercy upon me, O God, and unite me with Yourself. In an instant, You destroy and rebuild.<BR>
 You are all-wise and all-seeing; You are the Greatest Giver of all givers.<BR>
 He is the Eradicator of poverty, and the Destroyer of pain; the Gurmukh realizes spiritual wisdom and meditation. ||35||<BR>
 Losing his wealth, he cries out in anguish; the fool's consciousness is engrossed in wealth.<BR>
 How rare are those who gather the wealth of Truth, and love the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 If by losing your wealth, you may become absorbed in the Love of the One Lord, then just let it go.<BR>
 Dedicate your mind, and surrender your head; seek only the Support of the Creator Lord.<BR>
 Worldly affairs and wanderings cease, when the mind is filled with the bliss of the Shabad.<BR>
 Even one's enemies become friends, meeting with the Guru, the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 Wandering from forest to forest searching, you will find that those things are within the home of your own heart.<BR>
 United by the True Guru, you shall remain united, and the pains of birth and death will be ended. ||36||<BR>
 Through various rituals, one does not find release. Without virtue, one is sent to the City of Death.<BR>
 One will not have this world or the next; committing sinful mistakes, one comes to regret and repent in the end.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 060</H2></CENTER>
 He has neither spiritual wisdom or meditation; neither Dharmic faith mor meditation.<BR>
 Without the Name, how can one be fearless? How can he understand egotistical pride?<BR>
 I am so tired - how can I get there? This ocean has no bottom or end.<BR>
 I have no loving companions, whom I can ask for help.<BR>
 O Nanak, crying out, "Beloved, Beloved", we are united with the Uniter.<BR>
 He who separated me, unites me again; my love for the Guru is infinite. ||37||<BR>
 Sin is bad, but it is dear to the sinner.<BR>
 He loads himself with sin, and expands his world through sin.<BR>
 Sin is far away from one who understands himself.<BR>
 He is not afflicted by sorrow or separation.<BR>
 How can one avoid falling into hell? How can he cheat the Messenger of Death?<BR>
 How can coming and going be forgotten? Falsehood is bad, and death is cruel.<BR>
 The mind is enveloped by entanglements, and into entanglements it falls.<BR>
 Without the Name, how can anyone be saved? They rot away in sin. ||38||<BR>
 Again and again, the crow falls into the trap.<BR>
 Then he regrets it, but what can he do now?<BR>
 Even though he is trapped, he pecks at the food; he does not understand.<BR>
 If he meets the True Guru, then he sees with his eyes.<BR>
 Like a fish, he is caught in the noose of death.<BR>
 Do not seek liberation from anyone else, except the Guru, the Great Giver.<BR>
 Over and over again, he comes; over and over again, he goes.<BR>
 Be absorbed in love for the One Lord, and remain lovingly focused on Him.<BR>
 In this way you shall be saved, and you shall not fall into the trap again. ||39||<BR>
 She calls out, "Brother, O brother - stay, O brother!" But he becomes a stranger.<BR>
 Her brother departs for his own home, and his sister burns with the pain of separation.<BR>
 In this world, her father's home, the daughter, the innocent soul bride, loves her Young Husband Lord.<BR>
 If you long for your Husband Lord, O soul bride, then serve the True Guru with love.<BR>
 How rare are the spiritually wise, who meet the True Guru, and truly understand.<BR>
 All glorious greatness rests in the Lord and Master's Hands. He grants them, when He is pleased.<BR>
 How rare are those who contemplate the Word of the Guru's Bani; they become Gurmukh.<BR>
 This is the Bani of the Supreme Being; through it, one dwells within the home of his inner being. ||40||<BR>
 Shattering and breaking apart, He creates and re-creates; creating, He shatters again. He builds up what He has demolished, and demolishes what He has built.<BR>
 He dries up the pools which are full, and fills the dried tanks again. He is all-powerful and independent.<BR>
 Deluded by doubt, they have gone insane; without destiny, what do they obtain?<BR>
 The Gurmukhs know that God holds the string; wherever He pulls it, they must go.<BR>
 Those who sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, are forever imbued with His Love; they never again feel regret.<BR>
 Bhabha: If someone seeks, and then becomes Gurmukh, then he comes to dwell in the home of his own heart.<BR>
 Bhabha: The way of the terrifying world-ocean is treacherous. Remain free of hope, in the midst of hope, and you shall cross over.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, one comes to understand himself; in this way, he remains dead while yet alive. ||41||<BR>
 Crying out for the wealth and riches of Maya, they die; but Maya does not go along with them.<BR>
 The soul-swan arises and departs, sad and depressed, leaving its wealth behind.<BR>
 The false mind is hunted by the Messenger of Death; it carries its faults along when it goes.<BR>
 The mind turns inward, and merges with mind, when it is with virtue.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 061</H2></CENTER>
 Crying out, "Mine, mine!", they have died, but without the Name, they find only pain.<BR>
 So where are their forts, mansions, palaces and courts? They are like a short story.<BR>
 O Nanak, without the True Name, the false just come and go.<BR>
 He Himself is clever and so very beautiful; He Himself is wise and all-knowing. ||42||<BR>
 Those who come, must go in the end; they come and go, regretting and repenting.<BR>
 They will pass through 8.4 millions species; this number does not decrease or rise.<BR>
 They alone are saved, who love the Lord.<BR>
 Their worldly entanglements are ended, and Maya is conquered.<BR>
 Whoever is seen, shall depart; who should I make my friend?<BR>
 I dedicate my soul, and place my body and mind in offering before Him.<BR>
 You are eternally stable, O Creator, Lord and Master; I lean on Your Support.<BR>
 Conquered by virtue, egotism is killed; imbued with the Word of the Shabad, the mind rejects the world. ||43||<BR>
 Neither the kings nor the nobles will remain; neither the rich nor the poor will remain.<BR>
 When one's turn comes, no one can stay here.<BR>
 The path is difficult and treacherous; the pools and mountains are impassable.<BR>
 My body is filled with faults; I am dying of grief. Without virtue, how can I enter my home?<BR>
 The virtuous take virtue, and meet God; how can I meet them with love?<BR>
 If ony I could be like them, chanting and meditating within my heart on the Lord.<BR>
 He is overflowing with faults and demerits, but virtue dwells within him as well.<BR>
 Without the True Guru, he does not see God's Virtues; he does not chant the Glorious Virtues of God. ||44||<BR>
 God's soldiers take care of their homes; their pay is pre-ordained, before they come into the world.<BR>
 They serve their Supreme Lord and Master, and obtain the profit.<BR>
 They renounce greed, avarice and evil, and forget them from their minds.<BR>
 In the fortress of the body, they announce the victory of their Supreme King; they are never ever vanquished.<BR>
 One who calls himself a servant of his Lord and Master, and yet speaks defiantly to Him,<BR>
 shall forfeit his pay, and not be seated upon the throne.<BR>
 Glorious greatness rests in the hands of my Beloved; He gives, according to the Pleasure of His Will.<BR>
 He Himself does everything; who else should we address? No one else does anything. ||45||<BR>
 I cannot conceive of any other, who could be seated upon the royal cushions.<BR>
 The Supreme Man of men eradicates hell; He is True, and True is His Name.<BR>
 I wandered around searching for Him in the forests and meadows; I contemplate Him within my mind.<BR>
 The treasures of myriads of pearls, jewels and emeralds are in the hands of the True Guru.<BR>
 Meeting with God, I am exalted and elevated; I love the One Lord single-mindedly.<BR>
 O Nanak, one who lovingly meets with his Beloved, earns profit in the world hereafter.<BR>
 He who created and formed the creation, made your form as well.<BR>
 As Gurmukh, meditate on the Infinite Lord, who has no end or limitation. ||46||<BR>
 Rharha: The Dear Lord is beautiful;<BR>
 There is no other king, except Him.<BR>
 Rharha: Listen to the spell, and the Lord will come to dwell in your mind.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, one finds the Lord; do not be deluded by doubt.<BR>
 He alone is the true banker, who has the capital of the wealth of the Lord.<BR>
 The Gurmukh is perfect - applaud him!<BR>
 Through the beautiful Word of the Guru's Bani, the Lord is obtained; contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 062</H2></CENTER>
 Self-conceit is eliminated, and pain is eradicated; the soul bride obtains her Husband Lord. ||47||<BR>
 He hoards gold and silver, but this wealth is false and poisonous, nothing more than ashes.<BR>
 He calls himself a banker, gathering wealth, but he is ruined by his dual-mindedness.<BR>
 The truthful ones gather Truth; the True Name is priceless.<BR>
 The Lord is immaculate and pure; through Him, their honor is true, and their speech is true.<BR>
 You are my friend and companion, all-knowing Lord; You are the lake, and You are the swan.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to that being, whose mind is filled with the True Lord and Master.<BR>
 Know the One who created love and attachment to Maya, the Enticer.<BR>
 One who realizes the all-knowing Primal Lord, looks alike upon poison and nectar. ||48||<BR>
 Without patience and forgiveness, countless hundreds of thousands have perished.<BR>
 Their numbers cannot be counted; how could I count them? Bothered and bewildered, uncounted numbers have died.<BR>
 One who realizes his Lord and Master is set free, and not bound by chains.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Shabad, enter the Mansion of the Lord's Presence; you shall be blessed with patience, forgiveness, truth and peace.<BR>
 Partake of the true wealth of meditation, and the Lord Himself shall abide within your body.<BR>
 With mind, body and mouth, chant His Glorious Virtues forever; courage and composure shall enter deep within your mind.<BR>
 Through egotism, one is distracted and ruined; other than the Lord, all things are corrupt.<BR>
 Forming His creatures, He placed Himself within them; the Creator is unattached and infinite. ||49||<BR>
 No one knows the mystery of the Creator of the World.<BR>
 Whatever the Creator of the World does, is certain to occur.<BR>
 For wealth, some meditate on the Lord.<BR>
 By pre-ordained destiny, wealth is obtained.<BR>
 For the sake of wealth, some become servants or thieves.<BR>
 Wealth does not go along with them when they die; it passes into the hands of others.<BR>
 Without Truth, honor is not obtained in the Court of the Lord.<BR>
 Drinking in the subtle essence of the Lord, one is emancipated in the end. ||50||<BR>
 Seeing and perceiving, O my companions, I am wonder-struck and amazed.<BR>
 My egotism, which proclaimed itself in possessiveness and self-conceit, is dead. My mind chants the Word of the Shabad, and attains spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 I am so tired of wearing all these necklaces, hair-ties and bracelets, and decorating myself.<BR>
 Meeting with my Beloved, I have found peace; now, I wear the necklace of total virtue.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh attains the Lord, with love and affection.<BR>
 Without the Lord, who has found peace? Reflect upon this in your mind, and see.<BR>
 Read about the Lord, understand the Lord, and enshrine love for the Lord.<BR>
 Chant the Lord's Name, and meditate on the Lord; hold tight to the Support of the Name of the Lord. ||51||<BR>
 The inscription inscribed by the Creator Lord cannot be erased, O my companions.<BR>
 He who created the universe, in His Mercy, installs His Feet within us.<BR>
 Glorious greatness rests in the Hands of the Creator; reflect upon the Guru, and understand this.<BR>
 This inscription cannot be challenged. As it pleases You, You care for me.<BR>
 By Your Glance of Grace, I have found peace; O Nanak, reflect upon the Shabad.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs are confused; they rot away and die. Only by reflecting upon the Guru can they be saved.<BR>
 What can anyone say, about that Primal Lord, who cannot be seen?<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who has revealed Him to me, within my own heart. ||52||<BR>
 That Pandit, that religious scholar, is said to be well-educated, if he contemplates knowledge with intuitive ease.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 063</H2></CENTER>
 Considering his knowledge, he finds the essence of reality, and lovingly focuses his attention on the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh sells his knowledge; he earns poison, and eats poison.<BR>
 The fool does not think of the Word of the Shabad. He has no understanding, no comprehension. ||53||<BR>
 That Pandit is called Gurmukh, who imparts understanding to his students.<BR>
 Contemplate the Naam, the Name of the Lord; gather in the Naam, and earn the true profit in this world.<BR>
 With the true notebook of the true mind, study the most sublime Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 O Nanak, he alone is learned, and he alone is a wise Pandit, who wears the necklace of the Lord's Name. ||54||1||<BR>
 Raamkalee, First Mehl, Sidh Gosht ~ Conversations With The Siddhas:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The Siddhas formed an assembly; sitting in their Yogic postures, they shouted, "Salute this gathering of Saints."<BR>
 I offer my salutation to the One who is true, infinite and incomparably beautiful.<BR>
 I cut off my head, and offer it to Him; I dedicate my body and mind to Him.<BR>
 O Nanak, meeting with the Saints, Truth is obtained, and one is spontaneously blessed with distinction. ||1||<BR>
 What is the use of wandering around? Purity comes only through Truth.<BR>
 Without the True Word of the Shabad, no one finds liberation. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 "Who are you? What is your name? What is your way? What is your goal?<BR>
 We pray that you will answer us truthfully; we are a sacrifice to the humble Saints.<BR>
 Where is your seat? Where do you live, boy? Where did you come from, and where are you going?<BR>
 Tell us, Nanak - the detached Siddhas wait to hear your reply. What is your path?"||2||<BR>
 He dwells deep within the nucleus of each and every heart. This is my seat and my home. I walk in harmony with the Will of the True Guru.<BR>
 I came from the Celestial Lord God; I go wherever He orders me to go. I am Nanak, forever under the Command of His Will.<BR>
 I sit in the posture of the eternal, imperishable Lord. These are the Teachings I have received from the Guru.<BR>
 As Gurmukh, I have come to understand and realize myself; I merge in the Truest of the True. ||3||<BR>
 "The world-ocean is treacherous and impassable; how can one cross over?<BR>
 Charpat the Yogi says, O Nanak, think it over, and give us your true reply."<BR>
 What answer can I give to someone, who claims to understand himself?<BR>
 I speak the Truth; if you have already crossed over, how can I argue with you? ||4||<BR>
 The lotus flower floats untouched upon the surface of the water, and the duck swims through the stream;<BR>
 with one's consciousness focused on the Word of the Shabad, one crosses over the terrifying world-ocean. O Nanak, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 One who lives alone, as a hermit, enshrining the One Lord in his mind, remaining unaffected by hope in the midst of hope,<BR>
 sees and inspires others to see the inaccessible, unfathomable Lord. Nanak is his slave. ||5||<BR>
 "Listen, Lord, to our prayer. We seek your true opinion.<BR>
 Don't be angry with us - please tell us: How can we find the Guru's Door?"<BR>
 This fickle mind sits in its true home, O Nanak, through the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 The Creator Himself unites us in Union, and inspires us to love the Truth. ||6||<BR>
 "Away from stores and highways, we live in the woods, among plants and trees.<BR>
 For food, we take fruits and roots. This is the spiritual wisdom spoken by the renunciates.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 064</H2></CENTER>
 We bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, and obtain the fruits of peace; not even an iota of filth sticks to us.<BR>
 Luhaareepaa, the disciple of Gorakh says, this is the Way of Yoga."||7||<BR>
 In the stores and on the road, do not sleep; do not let your consciousness covet anyone else's home.<BR>
 Without the Name, the mind has no firm support; O Nanak, this hunger never departs.<BR>
 The Guru has revealed the stores and the city within the home of my own heart, where I intuitively carry on the true trade.<BR>
 Sleep little, and eat little; O Nanak, this is the essence of wisdom. ||8||<BR>
 "Wear the robes of the sect of Yogis who follow Gorakh; put on the ear-rings, begging wallet and patched coat.<BR>
 Among the twelve schools of Yoga, ours is the highest; among the six schools of philosophy, ours is the best path.<BR>
 This is the way to instruct the mind, so you will never suffer beatings again."<BR>
 Nanak speaks: the Gurmukh understands; this is the way that Yoga is attained. ||9||<BR>
 Let constant absorption in the Word of the Shabad deep within be your ear-rings; eradicate egotism and attachment.<BR>
 Discard sexual desire, anger and egotism, and through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, attain true understanding.<BR>
 For your patched coat and begging bowl, see the Lord God pervading and permeating everywhere; O Nanak, the One Lord will carry you across.<BR>
 True is our Lord and Master, and True is His Name. Analyze it, and you shall find the Word of the Guru to be True. ||10||<BR>
 Let your mind turn away in detachment from the world, and let this be your begging bowl. Let the lessons of the five elements be your cap.<BR>
 Let the body be your meditation mat, and the mind your loin cloth.<BR>
 Let truth, contentment and self-discipline be your companions.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh dwells on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||11||<BR>
 "Who is hidden? Who is liberated?<BR>
 Who is united, inwardly and outwardly?<BR>
 Who comes, and who goes?<BR>
 Who is permeating and pervading the three worlds?"||12||<BR>
 He is hidden within each and every heart. The Gurmukh is liberated.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Shabad, one is united, inwardly and outwardly.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh perishes, and comes and goes.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh merges in Truth. ||13||<BR>
 "How is one placed in bondage, and consumed by the serpent of Maya?<BR>
 How does one lose, and how does one gain?<BR>
 How does one become immaculate and pure? How is the darkness of ignorance removed?<BR>
 One who understands this essence of reality is our Guru."||14||<BR>
 Man is bound by evil-mindedness, and consumed by Maya, the serpent.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh loses, and the Gurmukh gains.<BR>
 Meeting the True Guru, darkness is dispelled.<BR>
 O Nanak, eradicating egotism, one merges in the Lord. ||15||<BR>
 Focused deep within, in perfect absorption,<BR>
 the soul-swan does not fly away, and the body-wall does not collapse.<BR>
 Then, one knows that his true home is in the cave of intuitive poise.<BR>
 O Nanak, the True Lord loves those who are truthful. ||16||<BR>
 "Why have you left your house and become a wandering Udaasee?<BR>
 Why have you adopted these religious robes?<BR>
 What merchandise do you trade?<BR>
 How will you carry others across with you?"||17||<BR>
 I became a wandering Udaasee, searching for the Gurmukhs.<BR>
 I have adopted these robes seeking the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.<BR>
 I trade in the merchandise of Truth.<BR>
 O Nanak, as Gurmukh, I carry others across. ||18||<BR>
 "How have you changed the course of your life?<BR>
 With what have you linked your mind?<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 065</H2></CENTER>
 How have you subdued your hopes and desires?<BR>
 How have you found the Light deep within your nucleus?<BR>
 Without teeth, how can you eat iron?<BR>
 Give us your true opinion, Nanak."||19||<BR>
 Born into the House of the True Guru, my wandering in reincarnation ended.<BR>
 My mind is attached and attuned to the unstruck sound current.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Shabad, my hopes and desires have been burnt away.<BR>
 As Gurmukh, I found the Light deep within the nucleus of my self.<BR>
 Eradicating the three qualities, one eats iron.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Emancipator emancipates. ||20||<BR>
 "What can you tell us about the beginning? In what home did the absolute dwell then?<BR>
 What are the ear-rings of spiritual wisdom? Who dwells in each and every heart?<BR>
 How can one avoid the attack of death? How can one enter the home of fearlessness?<BR>
 How can one know the posture of intuition and contentment, and overcome one's adversaries?"<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, egotism and corruption are conquered, and then one comes to dwell in the home of the self within.<BR>
 One who realizes the Shabad of the One who created the creation - Nanak is his slave. ||21||<BR>
 "Where did we come from? Where are we going? Where will we be absorbed?<BR>
 One who reveals the meaning of this Shabad is the Guru, who has no greed at all.<BR>
 How can one find the essence of the unmanifest reality? How does one become Gurmukh, and enshrine love for the Lord?<BR>
 He Himself is consciousness, He Himself is the Creator; share with us, Nanak, your wisdom."<BR>
 By His Command we come, and by His Command we go; by His Command, we merge in absorption.<BR>
 Through the Perfect Guru, live the Truth; through the Word of the Shabad, the state of dignity is attained. ||22||<BR>
 We can only express a sense of wonder about the beginning. The absolute abided endlessly deep within Himself then.<BR>
 Consider freedom from desire to be the ear-rings of the Guru's spiritual wisdom. The True Lord, the Soul of all, dwells within each and every heart.<BR>
 Through the Guru's Word, one merges in the absolute, and intuitively receives the immaculate essence.<BR>
 O Nanak, that Sikh who seeks and finds the Way does not serve any other.<BR>
 Wonderful and amazing is His Command; He alone realizes His Command and knows the true way of life of His creatures.<BR>
 One who eradicates his self-conceit becomes free of desire; he alone is a Yogi, who enshrines the True Lord deep within. ||23||<BR>
 From His state of absolute existence, He assumed the immaculate form; from formless, He assumed the supreme form.<BR>
 By pleasing the True Guru, the supreme status is obtained, and one is absorbed in the True Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 He knows the True Lord as the One and only; he sends his egotism and duality far away.<BR>
 He alone is a Yogi, who realizes the Word of the Guru's Shabad; the lotus of the heart blossoms forth within.<BR>
 If one remains dead while yet alive, then he understands everything; he knows the Lord deep within himself, who is kind and compassionate to all.<BR>
 O Nanak, he is blessed with glorious greatness; he realizes himself in all beings. ||24||<BR>
 We emerge from Truth, and merge into Truth again. The pure being merges into the One True Lord.<BR>
 The false come, and find no place of rest; in duality, they come and go.<BR>
 This coming and going in reincarnation is ended through the Word of the Guru's Shabad; the Lord Himself analyzes and grants His forgiveness.<BR>
 One who suffers from the disease of duality, forgets the Naam, the source of nectar.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 066</H2></CENTER>
 He alone understands, whom the Lord inspires to understand. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one is liberated.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Emancipator emancipates one who drives out egotism and duality. ||25||<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs are deluded, under the shadow of death.<BR>
 They look into the homes of others, and lose.<BR>
 The manmukhs are confused by doubt, wandering in the wilderness.<BR>
 Having lost their way, they are plundered; they chant their mantras at cremation grounds.<BR>
 They do not think of the Shabad; instead, they utter obscenities.<BR>
 O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Truth know peace. ||26||<BR>
 The Gurmukh lives in the Fear of God, the True Lord.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Bani, the Gurmukh refines the unrefined.<BR>
 The Gurmukh sings the immaculate, Glorious Praises of the Lord.<BR>
 The Gurmukh attains the supreme, sanctified status.<BR>
 The Gurmukh meditates on the Lord with every hair of his body.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh merges in Truth. ||27||<BR>
 The Gurmukh is pleasing to the True Guru; this is contemplation on the Vedas.<BR>
 Pleasing the True Guru, the Gurmukh is carried across.<BR>
 Pleasing the True Guru, the Gurmukh receives the spiritual wisdom of the Shabad.<BR>
 Pleasing the True Guru, the Gurmukh comes to know the path within.<BR>
 The Gurmukh attains the unseen and infinite Lord.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh finds the door of liberation. ||28||<BR>
 The Gurmukh speaks the unspoken wisdom.<BR>
 In the midst of his family, the Gurmukh lives a spiritual life.<BR>
 The Gurmukh lovingly meditates deep within.<BR>
 The Gurmukh obtains the Shabad, and righteous conduct.<BR>
 He knows the mystery of the Shabad, and inspires others to know it.<BR>
 O Nanak, burning away his ego, he merges in the Lord. ||29||<BR>
 The True Lord fashioned the earth for the sake of the Gurmukhs.<BR>
 There, he set in motion the play of creation and destruction.<BR>
 One who is filled with the Word of the Guru's Shabad enshrines love for the Lord.<BR>
 Attuned to the Truth, he goes to his home with honor.<BR>
 Without the True Word of the Shabad, no one receives honor.<BR>
 O Nanak, without the Name, how can one be absorbed in Truth? ||30||<BR>
 The Gurmukh obtains the eight miraculous spiritual powers, and all wisdom.<BR>
 The Gurmukh crosses over the terrifying world-ocean, and obtains true understanding.<BR>
 The Gurmukh knows the ways of truth and untruth.<BR>
 The Gurmukh knows worldliness and renunciation.<BR>
 The Gurmukh crosses over, and carries others across as well.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh is emancipated through the Shabad. ||31||<BR>
 Attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, egotism is dispelled.<BR>
 Attuned to the Naam, they remain absorbed in the True Lord.<BR>
 Attuned to the Naam, they contemplate the Way of Yoga.<BR>
 Attuned to the Naam, they find the door of liberation.<BR>
 Attuned to the Naam, they understand the three worlds.<BR>
 O Nanak, attuned to the Naam, eternal peace is found. ||32||<BR>
 Attuned to the Naam, they attain Sidh Gosht - conversation with the Siddhas.<BR>
 Attuned to the Naam, they practice intense meditation forever.<BR>
 Attuned to the Naam, they live the true and excellent lifestyle.<BR>
 Attuned to the Naam, they contemplate the Lord's virtues and spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 Without the Name, all that is spoken is useless.<BR>
 O Nanak, attuned to the Naam, their victory is celebrated. ||33||<BR>
 Through the Perfect Guru, one obtains the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 The Way of Yoga is to remain absorbed in Truth.<BR>
 The Yogis wander in the twelve schools of Yoga; the Sannyaasis in six and four.<BR>
 One who remains dead while yet alive, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, finds the door of liberation.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 067</H2></CENTER>
 Without the Shabad, all are attached to duality. Contemplate this in your heart, and see.<BR>
 O Nanak, blessed and very fortunate are those who keep the True Lord enshrined in their hearts. ||34||<BR>
 The Gurmukh obtains the jewel, lovingly focused on the Lord.<BR>
 The Gurmukh intuitively recognizes the value of this jewel.<BR>
 The Gurmukh practices Truth in action.<BR>
 The mind of the Gurmukh is pleased with the True Lord.<BR>

 The Gurmukh obtains the Supreme Lord, the Destroyer of fear.<BR>

 The Gurmukh understands the Simritees, the Shaastras and the Vedas.<BR>
 The Gurmukh knows the secrets of each and every heart.<BR>
 The Gurmukh eliminates hate and envy.<BR>
 The Gurmukh erases all accounting.<BR>
 The Gurmukh is imbued with love for the Lord's Name.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh realizes his Lord and Master. ||37||<BR>
 Without the Guru, one wanders, coming and going in reincarnation.<BR>
 Without the Guru, one's work is useless.<BR>
 Without the Guru, the mind is totally unsteady.<BR>
 Without the Guru, one is unsatisfied, and eats poison.<BR>
 Without the Guru, one is stung by the poisonous snake of Maya, and dies.<BR>
 O Nanak without the Guru, all is lost. ||38||<BR>
 One who meets the Guru is carried across.<BR>
 His sins are erased, and he is emancipated through virtue.<BR>
 The supreme peace of liberation is attained, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 The Gurmukh is never defeated.<BR>
 In the store of the body, this mind is the merchant;<BR>
 O Nanak, it deals intuitively in Truth. ||39||<BR>
 The Gurmukh is the bridge, built by the Architect of Destiny.<BR>
 The demons of passion which plundered Sri Lanka - the body - have been conquered.<BR>
 Ram Chand - the mind - has slaughtered Raawan - pride;<BR>
 the Gurmukh understands the secret revealed by Babheekhan.<BR>
 The Gurmukh carries even stones across the ocean.<BR>
 The Gurmukh saves millions of people. ||40||<BR>
 The comings and goings in reincarnation are ended for the Gurmukh.<BR>
 The Gurmukh is honored in the Court of the Lord.<BR>
 The Gurmukh distinguishes the true from the false.<BR>
 The Gurmukh focuses his meditation on the celestial Lord.<BR>
 In the Court of the Lord, the Gurmukh is absorbed in His Praises.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh is not bound by bonds. ||41||<BR>
 The Gurmukh obtains the Name of the Immaculate Lord.<BR>
 Through the Shabad, the Gurmukh burns away his ego.<BR>
 The Gurmukh sings the Glorious Praises of the True Lord.<BR>
 The Gurmukh remains absorbed in the True Lord.<BR>
 Through the True Name, the Gurmukh is honored and exalted.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh understands all the worlds. ||42||<BR>
 "What is the root, the source of all? What teachings hold for these times?<BR>
 Who is your guru? Whose disciple are you?<BR>
 What is that speech, by which you remain unattached?<BR>
 Listen to what we say, O Nanak, you little boy.<BR>
 Give us your opinion on what we have said.<BR>
 How can the Shabad carry us across the terrifying world-ocean?"||43||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 068</H2></CENTER>
 From the air came the beginning. This is the age of the True Guru's Teachings.<BR>
 The Shabad is the Guru, upon whom I lovingly focus my consciousness; I am the chaylaa, the disciple.<BR>
 Speaking the Unspoken Speech, I remain unattached.<BR>
 O Nanak, throughout the ages, the Lord of the World is my Guru.<BR>
 I contemplate the sermon of the Shabad, the Word of the One God.<BR>
 The Gurmukh puts out the fire of egotism. ||44||<BR>
 "With teeth of wax, how can one chew iron?<BR>
 What is that food, which takes away pride?<BR>
 How can one live in the palace, the home of snow, wearing robes of fire?<BR>
 Where is that cave, within which one may remain unshaken?<BR>
 Who should we know to be pervading here and there?<BR>
 What is that meditation, which leads the mind to be absorbed in itself?"||45||<BR>
 Eradicating egotism and individualism from within,<BR>
 and erasing duality, the mortal becomes one with God.<BR>
 The world is difficult for the foolish, self-willed manmukh;<BR>
 practicing the Shabad, one chews iron.<BR>
 Know the One Lord, inside and out.<BR>
 O Nanak, the fire is quenched, through the Pleasure of the True Guru's Will. ||46||<BR>
 Imbued with the True Fear of God, pride is taken away;<BR>
 realize that He is One, and contemplate the Shabad.<BR>
 With the True Shabad abiding deep within the heart,<BR>
 the body and mind are cooled and soothed, and colored with the Lord's Love.<BR>
 The fire of sexual desire, anger and corruption is quenched.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Beloved bestows His Glance of Grace. ||47||<BR>
 "The moon of the mind is cool and dark; how is it enlightened?<BR>
 How does the sun blaze so brilliantly?<BR>
 How can the constant watchful gaze of Death be turned away?<BR>
 By what understanding is the honor of the Gurmukh preserved?<BR>
 Who is the warrior, who conquers Death?<BR>
 Give us your thoughtful reply, O Nanak."||48||<BR>
 Giving voice to the Shabad, the moon of the mind is illuminated with infinity.<BR>
 When the sun dwells in the house of the moon, the darkness is dispelled.<BR>
 Pleasure and pain are just the same, when one takes the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 He Himself saves, and carries us across.<BR>
 With faith in the Guru, the mind merges in Truth,<BR>
 and then, prays Nanak, one is not consumed by Death. ||49||<BR>
 The essence of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is known to be the most exalted and excellent of all.<BR>
 Without the Name, one is afflicted by pain and death.<BR>
 When one's essence merges into the essence, the mind is satisfied and fulfilled.<BR>
 Duality is gone, and one enters into the home of the One Lord.<BR>
 The breath blows across the sky of the Tenth Gate and vibrates.<BR>
 O Nanak, the mortal then intuitively meets the eternal, unchanging Lord. ||50||<BR>
 The absolute Lord is deep within; the absolute Lord is outside us as well. The absolute Lord totally fills the three worlds.<BR>
 One who knows the Lord in the fourth state, is not subject to virtue or vice.<BR>
 One who knows the mystery of God the Absolute, who pervades each and every heart, knows the Primal Being, the Immaculate Divine Lord.<BR>
 That humble being who is imbued with the Immaculate Naam,<BR>
 O Nanak, is himself the Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny. ||51||<BR>
 "Everyone speaks of the Absolute Lord, the unmanifest void.<BR>
 How can one find this absolute void?<BR>
 Who are they, who are attuned to this absolute void?"<BR>
 They are like the Lord, from whom they originated.<BR>
 They are not born, they do not die; they do not come and go.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukhs instruct their minds. ||52||<BR>
 By practicing control over the nine gates, one attains perfect control over the Tenth Gate.<BR>
 There, the unstruck sound current of the absolute Lord vibrates and resounds.<BR>
 Behold the True Lord ever-present, and merge with Him.<BR>
 The True Lord is pervading and permeating each and every heart.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 069</H2></CENTER>
 The hidden Bani of the Word is revealed.<BR>
 O Nanak, the True Lord is revealed and known. ||53||<BR>
 Meeting with the Lord through intuition and love, peace is found.<BR>
 The Gurmukh remains awake and aware; he does not fall sleep.<BR>
 He enshrines the unlimited, absolute Shabad deep within.<BR>
 Chanting the Shabad, he is liberated, and saves others as well.<BR>
 Those who practice the Guru's Teachings are attuned to the Truth.<BR>
 O Nanak, those who eradicate their self-conceit meet with the Lord; they do not remain separated by doubt. ||54||<BR>
 "Where is that place, where evil thoughts are destroyed?<BR>
 The mortal does not understand the essence of reality; why must he suffer in pain?"<BR>
 No one can save one who is tied up at Death's door.<BR>
 Without the Shabad, no one has any credit or honor.<BR>
 "How can one obtain understanding and cross over?"<BR>
 O Nanak, the foolish self-willed manmukh does not understand. ||55||<BR>
 Evil thoughts are erased, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 Meeting with the True Guru, the door of liberation is found.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh does not understand the essence of reality, and is burnt to ashes.<BR>
 His evil-mindedness separates him from the Lord, and he suffers.<BR>
 Accepting the Hukam of the Lord's Command, he is blessed with all virtues and spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 O Nanak, he is honored in the Court of the Lord. ||56||<BR>
 One who possesses the merchandise, the wealth of the True Name,<BR>
 crosses over, and carries others across with him as well.<BR>
 One who intuitively understands, and is attuned to the Lord, is honored.<BR>
 No one can estimate his worth.<BR>
 Wherever I look, I see the Lord permeating and pervading.<BR>
 O Nanak, through the Love of the True Lord, one crosses over. ||57||<BR>
 "Where is the Shabad said to dwell? What will carry us across the terrifying world-ocean?<BR>
 The breath, when exhaled, extends out ten finger lengths; what is the support of the breath?<BR>
 Speaking and playing, how can one be stable and steady? How can the unseen be seen?"<BR>
 Listen, O master; Nanak prays truly. Instruct your own mind.<BR>
 The Gurmukh is lovingly attuned to the True Shabad. Bestowing His Glance of Grace, He unites us in His Union.<BR>
 He Himself is all-knowing and all-seeing. By perfect destiny, we merge in Him. ||58||<BR>
 That Shabad dwells deep within the nucleus of all beings. God is invisible; wherever I look, there I see Him.<BR>
 The air is the dwelling place of the absolute Lord. He has no qualities; He has all qualities.<BR>
 When He bestows His Glance of Grace, the Shabad comes to abide within the heart, and doubt is eradicated from within.<BR>
 The body and mind become immaculate, through the Immaculate Word of His Bani. Let His Name be enshrined in your mind.<BR>
 The Shabad is the Guru, to carry you across the terrifying world-ocean. Know the One Lord alone, here and hereafter.<BR>
 He has no form or color, shadow or illusion; O Nanak, realize the Shabad. ||59||<BR>
 O reclusive hermit, the True, Absolute Lord is the support of the exhaled breath, which extends out ten finger lengths.<BR>
 The Gurmukh speaks and churns the essence of reality, and realizes the unseen, infinite Lord.<BR>
 Eradicating the three qualities, he enshrines the Shabad within, and then, his mind is rid of egotism.<BR>
 Inside and out, he knows the One Lord alone; he is in love with the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 He understands the Sushmana, Ida and Pingala, when the unseen Lord reveals Himself.<BR>
 O Nanak, the True Lord is above these three energy channels. Through the Word, the Shabad of the True Guru, one merges with Him. ||60||<BR>
 "The air is said to be the soul of the mind. But what does the air feed on?<BR>
 What is the way of the spiritual teacher, and the reclusive hermit? What is the occupation of the Siddha?"<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 070</H2></CENTER>
 Without the Shabad, the essence does not come, O hermit, and the thirst of egotism does not depart.<BR>
 Imbued with the Shabad, one finds the ambrosial essence, and remains fulfilled with the True Name.<BR>
 "What is that wisdom, by which one remains steady and stable? What food brings satisfaction?"<BR>
 O Nanak, when one looks upon pain and pleasure alike, through the True Guru, then he is not consumed by Death. ||61||<BR>
 If one is not imbued with the Lord's Love, nor intoxicated with His subtle essence,<BR>
 without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he is frustrated, and consumed by his own inner fire.<BR>
 He does not preserve his semen and seed, and does not chant the Shabad.<BR>
 He does not control his breath; he does not worship and adore the True Lord.<BR>
 But one who speaks the Unspoken Speech, and remains balanced,<BR>
 O Nanak, attains the Lord, the Supreme Soul. ||62||<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, one is attuned to the Lord's Love.<BR>
 Drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar, he is intoxicated with the Truth.<BR>
 Contemplating the Guru, the fire within is put out.<BR>
 Drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar, the soul settles in peace.<BR>
 Worshipping the True Lord in adoration, the Gurmukh crosses over the river of life.<BR>
 O Nanak, after deep contemplation, this is understood. ||63||<BR>
 "Where does this mind-elephant live? Where does the breath reside?<BR>
 Where should the Shabad reside, so that the wanderings of the mind may cease?"<BR>
 When the Lord blesses one with His Glance of Grace, he leads him to the True Guru. Then, this mind dwells in its own home within.<BR>
 When the individual consumes his egotism, he becomes immaculate, and his wandering mind is restrained.<BR>
 "How can the root, the source of all be realized? How can the soul know itself? How can the sun enter into the house of the moon?"<BR>
 The Gurmukh eliminates egotism from within; then, O Nanak, the sun naturally enters into the home of the moon. ||64||<BR>
 When the mind becomes steady and stable, it abides in the heart, and then the Gurmukh realizes the root, the source of all.<BR>
 The breath is seated in the home of the navel; the Gurmukh searches, and finds the essence of reality.<BR>
 This Shabad permeates the nucleus of the self, deep within, in its own home; the Light of this Shabad pervades the three worlds.<BR>
 Hunger for the True Lord shall consume your pain, and through the True Lord, you shall be satisfied.<BR>
 The Gurmukh knows the unstruck sound current of the Bani; how rare are those who understand.<BR>
 Says Nanak, one who speaks the Truth is dyed in the color of Truth, which will never fade away. ||65||<BR>
 "When this heart and body did not exist, where did the mind reside?<BR>
 When there was no support of the navel lotus, then in which home did the breath reside?<BR>
 When there was no form or shape, then how could anyone lovingly focus on the Shabad?<BR>
 When there was no dungeon formed from egg and sperm, who could measure the Lord's value and extent?<BR>
 When color, dress and form could not be seen, how could the True Lord be known?"<BR>
 O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are detached. Then and now, they see the Truest of the True. ||66||<BR>
 When the heart and the body did not exist, O hermit, then the mind resided in the absolute, detached Lord.<BR>
 When there was no support of the lotus of the navel, the breath remained in its own home, attuned to the Lord's Love.<BR>
 When there was no form or shape or social class, then the Shabad, in its essence, resided in the unmanifest Lord.<BR>
 When the world and the sky did not even exist, the Light of the Formless Lord filled the three worlds.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 071</H2></CENTER>
 Color, dress and form were contained in the One Lord; the Shabad was contained in the One, Wondrous Lord.<BR>
 Without the True Name, no one can become pure; O Nanak, this is the Unspoken Speech. ||67||<BR>
 "How, in what way, was the world formed, O man? And what disaster will end it?"<BR>
 In egotism, the world was formed, O man; forgetting the Naam, it suffers and dies.<BR>
 One who becomes Gurmukh contemplates the essence of spiritual wisdom; through the Shabad, he burns away his egotism.<BR>
 His body and mind become immaculate, through the Immaculate Bani of the Word. He remains absorbed in Truth.<BR>
 Through the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he remains detached; he enshrines the True Name in his heart.<BR>
 O Nanak, without the Name, Yoga is never attained; reflect upon this in your heart, and see. ||68||<BR>
 The Gurmukh is one who reflects upon the True Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 The True Bani is revealed to the Gurmukh.<BR>
 The mind of the Gurmukh is drenched with the Lord's Love, but how rare are those who understand this.<BR>
 The Gurmukh dwells in the home of the self, deep within.<BR>
 The Gurmukh realizes the Way of Yoga.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh knows the One Lord alone. ||69||<BR>
 Without serving the True Guru, Yoga is not attained;<BR>
 without meeting the True Guru, no one is liberated.<BR>
 Without meeting the True Guru, the Naam cannot be found.<BR>
 Without meeting the True Guru, one suffers in terrible pain.<BR>
 Without meeting the True Guru, there is only the deep darkness of egotistical pride.<BR>
 O Nanak, without the True Guru, one dies, having lost the opportunity of this life. ||70||<BR>
 The Gurmukh conquers his mind by subduing his ego.<BR>
 The Gurmukh enshrines Truth in his heart.<BR>
 The Gurmukh conquers the world; he knocks down the Messenger of Death, and kills it.<BR>
 The Gurmukh does not lose in the Court of the Lord.<BR>
 The Gurmukh is united in God's Union; he alone knows.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh realizes the Word of the Shabad. ||71||<BR>
 This is the essence of the Shabad - listen, you hermits and Yogis. Without the Name, there is no Yoga.<BR>
 Those who are attuned to the Name, remain intoxicated night and day; through the Name, they find peace.<BR>
 Through the Name, everything is revealed; through the Name, understanding is obtained.<BR>
 Without the Name, people wear all sorts of religious robes; the True Lord Himself has confused them.<BR>
 The Name is obtained only from the True Guru, O hermit, and then, the Way of Yoga is found.<BR>
 Reflect upon this in your mind, and see; O Nanak, without the Name, there is no liberation. ||72||<BR>
 You alone know Your state and extent, Lord; What can anyone say about it?<BR>
 You Yourself are hidden, and You Yourself are revealed. You Yourself enjoy all pleasures.<BR>
 The seekers, the Siddhas, the many gurus and disciples wander around searching for You, according to Your Will.<BR>
 They beg for Your Name, and You bless them with this charity. I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.<BR>
 The eternal imperishable Lord God has staged this play; the Gurmukh understands it.<BR>
 O Nanak, He extends Himself throughout the ages; there is no other than Him. ||73||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 072</H2></CENTER>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Vaar Of Raamkalee, Third Mehl,<BR>
 To Be Sung To The Tune Of 'Jodha And Veera Poorbaanee':<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The True Guru is the field of intuitive wisdom. One who is inspired to love Him,<BR>
 plants the seed of the Name there. The Name sprouts up, and he remains absorbed in the Name.<BR>
 But this egotism is the seed of skepticism; it has been uprooted.<BR>
 It is not planted there, and it does not sprout; whatever God grants us, we eat.<BR>
 When water mixes with water, it cannot be separated again.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh is wonderful; come, poeple, and see!<BR>
 But what can the poor people see? They do not understand.<BR>
 He alone sees, whom the Lord causes to see; the Lord comes to dwell in his mind. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh is the field of sorrow and suffering. He plains sorrow, and eats sorrow.<BR>
 In sorrow he is born, and in sorrow he dies. Acting in egotism, his life passes away.<BR>
 He does not understand the coming and going of reincarnation; the blind man acts in blindness.<BR>
 He does not know the One who gives, but he is attached to what is given.<BR>
 O Nanak, he acts according to his pre-ordained destiny. He cannot do anything else. ||2||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 Meeting the True Guru, everlasting peace is obtained. He Himself leads us to meet Him.<BR>
 This is the true meaning of peace, that one becomes immaculate within oneself.<BR>
 The doubt of ignorance is eradicated, and spiritual wisdom is obtained.<BR>
 Nanak comes to gaze upon the One Lord alone; wherever he looks, there He is. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 The True Lord created His throne, upon which He sits.<BR>
 He Himself is everything; this is what the Word of the Guru's Shabad says.<BR>
 Through His almighty creative power, He created and fashioned the mansions and hotels.<BR>
 He made the two lamps, the sun and the moon; He formed the perfect form.<BR>
 He Himself sees, and He Himself hears; meditate on the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||<BR>
 Waaho! Waaho! Hail, hail, O True King! True is Your Name. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Shalok:<BR>
 Kabeer, I have ground myself into henna paste.<BR>
 O my Husband Lord, You took no notice of me; You never applied me to Your feet. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 O Nanak, my Husband Lord keeps me like henna paste; He blesses me with His Glance of Grace.<BR>
 He Himself grinds me, and He Himself rubs me; He Himself applies me to His feet.<BR>
 This is the cup of love of my Lord and Master; He gives it as He chooses. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 You created the world with its variety; by the Hukam of Your Command, it comes, goes, and merges again in You.<BR>
 You Yourself see, and blossom forth; there is no one else at all.<BR>
 As it pleases You, You keep me. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I understand You.<BR>
 You are the strength of all. As it pleases You, You lead us on.<BR>
 There is no other as great as You; unto whom should I speak and talk? ||2||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 Deluded by doubt, I wandered over the whole world. Searching, I became frustrated.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 073</H2></CENTER>
 My Husband Lord has not blessed me with peace and tranquility; what will work with Him?<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, I meditate on the Lord; I enshrine Him deep within my heart.<BR>
 O Nanak, seated in his her own home, she finds her Husband Lord, when the Creator Lord grants His Grace. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 Chasing after worldly affairs, the day is wasted, and the night passes in sleep.<BR>
 Speaking lies, one eats poison; the self-willed manmukh departs, crying out in pain.<BR>
 The Mesenger of Death holds his club over the mortal's head; in the love of duality, he loses his honor.<BR>
 He never even thinks of the Name of the Lord; over and over again, he comes and goes in reincarnation.<BR>
 But if, by Guru's Grace, the Lord's Name comes to dwell in his mind, then the Messenger of Death will not strike him down with his club.<BR>
 Then, O Nanak, he merges intuitively into the Lord, receiving His Grace. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Some are linked to His Praises, when the Lord blesses them with the Guru's Teachings.<BR>
 Some are blessed with the Name of the eternal, unchanging True Lord.<BR>
 Water, air and fire, by His Will, worship Him.<BR>
 They are held in the Fear of God; He has formed the perfect form.<BR>
 The Hukam, the Command of the One Lord is all-pervasive; accepting it, peace is found. ||3||<BR>
 Shalok:<BR>
 Kabeer, such is the touchstone of the Lord; the false cannot even touch it.<BR>
 He alone passes this test of the Lord, who remains dead while yet alive. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 How can this mind be conquered? How can it be killed?<BR>
 If one does not accept the Word of the Shabad, egotism does not depart.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, egotism is eradicated, and then, one is Jivan Mukta - liberated while yet alive.<BR>
 O Nanak, one whom the Lord forgives is united with Him, and then no obstacles block his way. ||2||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 Everyone can say that they are dead while yet alive; how can they be liberated while yet alive?<BR>
 If someone restrains himself through the Fear of God, and takes the medicine of the Love of God,<BR>
 night and day, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. In celestial peace and poise, he crosses over the poisonous, terrifying world-ocean, through the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Gurmukh finds the Lord; he is blessed with His Glance of Grace. ||3||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 God created the love of duality, and the three modes which pervade the universe.<BR>
 He created Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, who act according to His Will.<BR>
 The Pandits, the religious scholars, and the astrologers study their books, but they do not understand contemplation.<BR>
 Everything is Your play, O True Creator Lord.<BR>
 As it pleases You, You bless us with forgiveness, and merge us in the True Word of the Shabad. ||4||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 The man of false mind practices falsehood.<BR>
 He runs after Maya, and yet pretends to be a man of disciplined meditation.<BR>
 Deluded by doubt, he visits all the sacred shrines of pilgrimage.<BR>
 How can such a man of disciplined meditation attain the supreme status?<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, one lives the Truth.<BR>
 O Nanak, such a man of disciplined meditation attains liberation. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 He alone is a man of disciplined meditation, who practices this self-discipline.<BR>
 Meeting with the True Guru, he contemplates the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 Serving the True Guru - this is the only acceptable disciplined meditation.<BR>
 O Nanak, such a man of disciplined meditation is honored in the Court of the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 He created the night and the day, for the activities of the world.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 074</H2></CENTER>
 Following the Guru's Teachings, one's heart is illumined, and the darkness is dispelled.<BR>
 By the Hukam of His Command, He creates everything; He pervades and permeates all the woods and meadows.<BR>
 He Himself is everything; the Gurmukh constantly chants the Lord's Name.<BR>
 Through the Shabad, understanding comes; the True Lord Himself inspires us to understand. ||5||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 He is not called a renunciate, whose consciousness is filled with doubt.<BR>
 Donations to him bring proportionate rewards.<BR>
 He hungers for the supreme status of the Fearless, Immaculate Lord;<BR>
 O Nanak, how rare are those who offer him this food. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 They are not called renunciates, who take food in the homes of others.<BR>
 For the sake of their bellies, they wear various religious robes.<BR>
 They alone are renunciates, O Nanak, who enter into their own souls.<BR>
 They seek and find their Husband Lord; they dwell within the home of their own inner self. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 They sky and the earth are separate, but the True Lord supports them from within.<BR>
 True are all those homes and gates, within which the True Name is enshrined.<BR>
 The Hukam of the True Lord's Command is effective everywhere. The Gurmukh merges in the True Lord.<BR>
 He Himself is True, and True is His throne. Seated upon it, He administers true justice.<BR>
 The Truest of the True is all-pervading everywhere; the Gurmukh sees the unseen. ||6||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>
 In the world-ocean, the Infinite Lord abides. The false come and go in reincarnation.<BR>
 One who walks according to his own will, suffers terrible punishment.<BR>
 All things are in the world-ocean, but they are obtained only by the karma of good actions.<BR>
 O Nanak, he alone obtains the nine treasures, who walks in the Will of the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Third Mehl:<BR>
 One who intuitively serves the True Guru, loses his life in egotism.<BR>
 His tongue does not taste the sublime essence of the Lord, and his heart-lotus does not blossom forth.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukh eats poison and dies; he is ruined by love and attachment to Maya.<BR>
 Without the Name of the One Lord, his life is cursed, and his home is cursed as well.<BR>
 When God Himself bestows His Glance of Grace, then one becomes the slave of His slaves.<BR>
 And then, night and day, he serves the True Guru, and never leaves His side.<BR>
 As the lotus flower floats unaffected in the water, so does he remain detached in his own household.<BR>
 O servant Nanak, the Lord acts, and inspires everyone to act, according to the Pleasure of His Will. He is the treasure of virtue. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 For thirty-six ages, there was utter darkness. Then, the Lord revealed Himself.<BR>
 He Himself created the entire universe. He Himself blessed it with understanding.<BR>
 He created the Simritees and the Shaastras; He calculates the accounts of virtue and vice.<BR>
 He alone understands, whom the Lord inspires to understand and to be pleased with the True Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 He Himself is all-pervading; He Himself forgives, and unites with Himself. ||7||<BR>
 Shalok, Third Mehl:<BR>

 She who is in love with her Lord, is the most infinitely beautiful.<BR>
 Such a beautiful, happy soul-bride enjoys her Husband Lord forever.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs do not know how to decorate themselves; wasting their whole lives, they depart.<BR>
 Those who decorate themselves without devotional worship to the Lord, are continually reincarnated to suffer.<BR>
 They do not obtain respect in this world; the Creator Lord alone knows what will happen to them in the world hereafter.<BR>
 O Nanak, the True Lord is the One and only; duality exists only in the world.<BR>

 O Nanak, one who accepts the Will of the Lord is His devotee. Without accepting it, he is the falsest of the false. ||1||<BR>

 They come, and sit and talk for their own purposes. The Messenger of Death strikes them down.<BR>
 Hereafter, they are called to account in the Court of the Lord; the false ones are struck down and humiliated.<BR>
 How can this filth of falsehood be washed off? Can anyone think about this, and find the way?<BR>
 If one meets with the True Guru, He implants the Naam, the Name of the Lord within; all his sins are destroyed.<BR>
 Let all bow in humility to that humble being who chants the Naam, and worships the Naam in adoration.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 076</H2></CENTER>
 The Naam washes off the filth of falsehood; chanting the Naam, one becomes truthful.<BR>

 One who knows the Lord here, realizes Him there as well.<BR>
 Others, whether Hindu or Muslim, are just babbling.<BR>
 Everyone's account is read in the Court of the Lord;<BR>
 without the karma of good actions, no one crosses over.<BR>
 One who speaks the True Name of the True Lord,<BR>

 Pauree:<BR>
 The fortress of the body is called the Mansion of the Lord.<BR>
 The rubies and gems are found within it; the Gurmukh chants the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 The body, the Mansion of the Lord, is very beautiful, when the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is implanted deep within.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs ruin themselves; they boil continuously in attachment to Maya.<BR>

 When you look alike upon sunshine and shade,<BR>

 The students follow the six systems.<BR>
 They are neither worldly people, nor detached renunciates.<BR>
 One who remains absorbed in the Formless Lord<BR>
 - why should he go out begging? ||7||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 That alone is said to be the Lord's temple, where the Lord is known.<BR>

 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 To ask for any other than You, Lord, is the most miserable of miseries.<BR>
 Please bless me with Your Name, and make me content; may the hunger of my mind be satisfied.<BR>
 The Guru has made the woods and meadows green again. O Nanak, is it any wonder that He blesses human beings as well? ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Such is that Great Giver; may I never forget Him from my mind.<BR>
 I cannot survive without Him, for an instant, for a moment, for a second.<BR>
 Inwardly and outwardly, He is with us; how can we hide anything from Him?<BR>
 One whose honor He Himself has preserved, crosses over the terrifying world-ocean.<BR>
 He alone is a devotee, a spiritual teacher, and a disciplined pratictioner of meditation, whom the Lord has so blessed.<BR>
 He alone is perfect and renowned as supreme, whom the Lord has blessed with His power.<BR>
 He alone endures the unendurable, whom the Lord inspires to endure it.<BR>
 And he alone meets the True Lord, within whose mind the Guru's Mantra is implanted. ||3||<BR>
 Shalok, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Blessed are those beautiful Ragas which, when chanted, quench all thirst.<BR>
 Blessed are those beautiful people who, as Gurmukh, chant the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to those who single-mindedly worship and adore the One Lord.<BR>
 I yearn for the dust of their feet; by His Grace, it is obtained.<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to those who are imbued with love for the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 I tell them the state of my soul, and pray that I may be united with the Sovereign Lord King, my Friend.<BR>
 The Perfect Guru has united me with Him, and the pains of birth and death have departed.<BR>
 Servant Nanak has found the inaccessible, infinitely beautiful Lord, and he will not go anywhere else. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Blessed is that time, blessed is that hour, blessed is that second, excellent is that instant;<BR>
 blessed is that day, and that opportunity, when I gazed upon the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan.<BR>
 The mind's desires are fulfilled, when the inaccessible, unfathomable Lord is obtained.<BR>
 Egotism and emotional attachment are eradicated, and one leans only on the Support of the True Name.<BR>
 O servant Nanak, one who is committed to the Lord's service - the whole world is saved along with him. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 How rare are those who are blessed to praise the Lord, in devotional worship.<BR>
 Those who are blessed with the Lord's treasures are not called to give their account again.<BR>
 Those who are imbued with His Love are absorbed in ecstasy.<BR>
 They take the Support of the One Name; the One Name is their only food.<BR>
 For their sake, the world eats and enjoys.<BR>
 Their Beloved Lord belongs to them alone.<BR>

 The desires of the mind are fulfilled; I have attained my pre-destined Union with God.<BR>
 Nanak has obtained the True Name; He enjoys the enjoyments forever. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Friendship with the self-willed manmukhs is an alliance with Maya.<BR>
 As we watch, they run away; they never stand firm.<BR>
 As long as they get food and clothing, they stick around.<BR>
 But on that day when they receive nothing, then they start to curse.<BR>
 The self-willed manmukhs are ignorant and blind; they do not know the secrets of the soul.<BR>
 The false bond does not last; it is like stones joined with mud.<BR>
 The blind do not understand themselves; they are engrossed in false worldly entanglements.<BR>
 Entangled in false attachments, they pass their lives in egotism and self-conceit.<BR>
 But that being, whom the Lord has blessed with His Mercy from the very beginning, does perfect deeds, and accumulates good karma.<BR>
 O servant Nanak, those humble beings alone are saved, who enter the Sanctuary of the True Guru. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Those who are imbued with the Lord's Vision, speak the Truth.<BR>
 How can I obtain the dust of those who realize their Lord and Master?<BR>
 The mind, stained by corruption, becomes pure by associating with them.<BR>
 One sees the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, when the door of doubt is opened.<BR>
 That one, unto whom the Mansion of the Lord's Presence is revealed, is never pushed or shoved.<BR>
 My mind and body are enraptured, when the Lord blesses me, even for an instant, with His Glance of Grace.<BR>
 The nine treasures, and the treasure of the Naam are obtained by commitment to the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 He alone is blessed with the dust of the feet of the Saints, upon whose forehead such pre-ordained desiny is inscribed. ||5||<BR>
 Shalok, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 O deer-eyed bride, I speak the Truth, which shall save you.<BR>
 Listen to these beautiful words, O beauteous bride; your Beloved Lord is your mind's only support.<BR>
 You have fallen in love with an evil person; tell me - show me why!<BR>
 I lack nothing, and I am not sad or depressed; I have no deficiency at all.<BR>
 I abandoned and lost my fascinating and beautiful Husband Lord; in this evil-mindedness, I have lost my good fortune.<BR>
 I am not mistaken, and I am not confused; I have no egotism, and commit no offense.<BR>
 As You have linked me, so I am linked; listen to my true message.<BR>
 She alone is the blessed soul-bride, and she alone is fortunate, upon whom the Husband Lord has showered His Mercy.<BR>
 Her Husband Lord takes away all her faults and mistakes; hugging her close in His embrace, He embellishes her.<BR>
 The unfortunate soul-bride makes this prayer: O Nanak, when will my turn come?<BR>
 All the blessed soul-brides celebrate and make merry; bless me as well with a night of bliss, O Lord. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Why do you waver, O my mind? The Lord is the Fulfiller of hopes and desires.<BR>
 Meditate on the True Guru, the Primal Being; He is the Destroyer of all pains.<BR>
 Worship and adore the Lord's Name, O my mind; all sins and corruption shall be washed away.<BR>
 Those who are blessed with such pre-ordained destiny, are in love with the Formless Lord.<BR>
 They abandon the tastes of Maya, and gather in the infinite wealth of the Naam.<BR>
 Twenty-four hours a day, they are lovingly absorbed in the One Lord; they surrender and accept the Will of the Infinite Lord.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 085</H2></CENTER>

 One who is conscious of You becomes very wealthy.<BR>
 One who is conscious of You has a great family.<BR>
 One who is conscious of You saves his ancestors. ||6||<BR>
 Shalok, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Blind inwardly, and blind outwardly, he sings falsely, falsely.<BR>
 He washes his body, and draws ritual marks on it, and totally runs after wealth.<BR>
 But the filth of his egotism is not removed from within, and over and over again, he comes and goes in reincarnation.<BR>
 Engulfed in sleep, and tormented by frustrated sexual desire, he chants the Lord's Name with his mouth.<BR>
 He is called a Vaishnav, but he is bound to deeds of egotism; by threshing only husks, what rewards can be obtained?<BR>
 Sitting among the swans, the crane does not become one of them; sitting there, he keeps staring at the fish.<BR>
 And when the gathering of swans looks and sees, they realize that they can never form an alliance with the crane.<BR>
 The swans peck at the diamonds and pearls, while the crane chases after frogs.<BR>
 The poor crane flies away, so that his secret will not be exposed.<BR>
 Whatever the Lord attaches one to, to that he is attached. Who is to blame, when the Lord wills it so?<BR>
 The True Guru is the lake, overflowing with pearls. One who meets the True Guru obtains them.<BR>
 The Sikh-swans gather at the lake, according to the Will of the True Guru.<BR>
 The lake is filled with the wealth of these jewels and pearls; they are spent and consumed, but they never run out.<BR>
 The swan never leaves the lake; such is the Pleasure of the Creator's Will.<BR>
 O servant Nanak, one who has such pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon his forehead - that Sikh comes to the Guru.<BR>
 He saves himself, and saves all his generations as well; he emancipates the whole world. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 He is called a Pandit, a religious scholar, and yet he wanders along many pathways. He is as hard as uncooked beans.<BR>
 He is filled with attachment, and constantly engrossed in doubt; his body cannot hold still.<BR>
 False is his coming, and false is his going; he is continually on the lookout for Maya.<BR>
 If someone speaks the truth, then he is aggravated; he is totally filled with anger.<BR>
 The evil fool is engrossed in evil-mindedness and false intellectualizations; his mind is attached to emotional attachment.<BR>
 The deceiver abides with the five deceivers; it is a gathering of like minds.<BR>
 And when the Jeweller, the True Guru, appraises him, then he is exposed as mere iron.<BR>
 Mixed and mingled with others, he was passed off as genuine in many places; but now, the veil has been lifted, and he stands naked before all.<BR>
 One who comes to the Sanctuary of the True Guru, shall be transformed from iron into gold.<BR>
 The True Guru has no anger or vengeance; He looks upon son and enemy alike. Removing faults and mistakes, He purifies the human body.<BR>
 O Nanak, one who has such pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon his forehead, is in love with the True Guru.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 086</H2></CENTER>

 Please grant Your Grace, O Merciful Lord; please forgive me.<BR>
 Forever and ever, I chant Your Name; I fall at the feet of the True Guru.<BR>
 Please, dwell within my mind and body, and end my sufferings.<BR>
 Please give me Your hand, and save me, that fear may not afflict me.<BR>
 May I sing Your Glorious Praises day and night; please commit me to this task.<BR>
 Associating with the humble Saints, the disease of egotism is eradicated.<BR>
 The One Lord and Master is all-pervading, permeating everywhere.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, I have truly found the Truest of the True.<BR>

 One who is blessed with Your Kind Mercy is dedicated to Your worship. ||8||<BR>
 Shalok, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Be Merciful, O my Lord and Master, that I may pass my life in the Society of the Saints.<BR>
 Those who forget You are born only to die and be reincarnated again; their sufferings will never end. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Meditate in remembrance within your heart on the True Guru, whether you are on the most difficult path, on the mountain or by the river bank.<BR>

 Where You are, Almighty Lord, there is no one else.<BR>
 There, in the fire of the mother's womb, You protected us.<BR>
 Hearing Your Name, the Messenger of Death runs away.<BR>
 The terrifying, treacherous, impassible world-ocean is crossed over, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.<BR>
 Those who feel thirst for You, take in Your Ambrosial Nectar.<BR>
 This is the only act of goodness in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, to sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.<BR>

 You are eternal and unchanging, without vengeance and True; True is the Darbaar of Your Court.<BR>
 Your worth cannot be described; You have no end or limitation.<BR>
 To forsake God, and ask for something else, is all corruption and ashes.<BR>
 They alone find peace, and they are the true kings, whose dealings are true.<BR>
 Those who are in love with God's Name, intuitively enjoy the essence of peace.<BR>
 Nanak worships and adores the One Lord; he seeks the dust of the Saints. ||1||<BR>

 Singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, bliss, peace and rest are obtained.<BR>

 O Nanak, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; this is the Teaching imparted by the Perfect Guru.<BR>
 In the Lord's Will, they practice meditation, austerity and self-discipline; in the Lord's Will, they are released.<BR>
 In the Lord's Will, they are made to wander in reincarnation; in the Lord's Will, they are forgiven.<BR>
 In the Lord's Will, pain and pleasure are experienced; in the Lord's Will, actions are performed.<BR>
 In the Lord's Will, clay is fashioned into form; in the Lord's Will, His Light is infused into it.<BR>
 In the Lord's Will, enjoyments are enjoyed; in the Lord's Will, these enjoyments are denied.<BR>
 In the Lord's Will, they are incarnated in heaven and hell; in the Lord's Will, they fall to the ground.<BR>
 In the Lord's Will, they are committed to His devotional worship and Praise; O Nanak, how rare are these! ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 Hearing, hearing of the glorious greatness of the True Name, I live.<BR>
 Even ignorant beasts and goblins can be saved, in an instant.<BR>

 My mother-in-law is my enemy, O Nanak; my father-in-law is argumentative and my brother-in-law burns me at every step.<BR>

 Those who are blessed by their spiritual teacher are not even scratched. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Fareed, blessed is the life, with such a beautiful body.<BR>
 How rare are those who are found to love their Beloved Lord. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 He alone obtains meditation, austerities, self-discipline, compassion and Dharmic faith, whom the Lord so blesses.<BR>
 He alone meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, whose fire the Lord puts out.<BR>
 The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, the Inaccessible Primal Lord, inspires us to look upon all with an impartial eye.<BR>
 With the support of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, one falls in love with God.<BR>
 One's faults are eradicated, and one's face becomes radiant and bright; through the Lord's Name, one crosses over.<BR>
 The fear of birth and death is removed, and he is not reincarnated again.<BR>
 God lifts him up and pulls him out of the deep, dark pit, and attaches him to the hem of His robe.<BR>
 O Nanak, God forgives him, and holds him close in His embrace. ||21||<BR>
 Shalok, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One who loves God is imbued with the deep crimson color of His love.<BR>
 O Nanak, such a person is rarely found; the value of such a humble person can never be estimated. ||1||<BR>
 Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The True Name has pierced the nucleus of my self deep within. Outside, I see the True Lord as well.<BR>
 O Nanak, He is pervading and permeating all places, the forests and the meadows, the three worlds, and every hair. ||2||<BR>
 Pauree:<BR>
 He Himself created the Universe; He Himself imbues it.<BR>
 He Himself is One, and He Himself has numerous forms.<BR>
 He Himself is within all, and He Himself is beyond them.<BR>
 He Himself is known to be far away, and He Himself is right here.<BR>
 He Himself is hidden, and He Himself is revealed.<BR>
 No one can estimate the value of Your Creation, Lord.<BR>
 You are deep and profound, unfathomable, infinite and invaluable.<BR>
 O Nanak, the One Lord is all-pervading. You are the One and only. ||22||1||2||<BR>
 Sudh||<BR>
 Vaar Of Raamkalee, Uttered By Satta And Balwand The Drummer:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 One who chants the Name of the Almighty Creator - how can his words be judged?<BR>
 His divine virtues are the true sisters and brothers; through them, the gift of supreme status is obtained.<BR>
 Nanak established the kingdom; He built the true fortress on the strongest foundations.<BR>
 He installed the royal canopy over Lehna's head; chanting the Lord's Praises, He drank in the Ambrosial Nectar.<BR>
 The Guru implanted the almighty sword of the Teachings to illuminate his soul.<BR>
 The Guru bowed down to His disciple, while Nanak was still alive.<BR>
 The King, while still alive, applied the ceremonial mark to his forehead. ||1||<BR>
 Nanak proclaimed Lehna's succession - he earned it.<BR>
 They shared the One Light and the same way; the King just changed His body.<BR>
 The immaculate canopy waves over Him, and He sits on the throne in the Guru's shop.<BR>
 He does as the Guru commands; He tasted the tasteless stone of Yoga.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 092</H2></CENTER>
 The Langar - the Kitchen of the Guru's Shabad has been opened, and its supplies never run short.<BR>
 Whatever His Master gave, He spent; He distributed it all to be eaten.<BR>
 The Praises of the Master were sung, and the Divine Light descended from the heavens to the earth.<BR>
 Gazing upon You, O True King, the filth of countless past lives is washed away.<BR>
 The Guru gave the True Command; why should we hesitate to proclaim this?<BR>
 His sons did not obey His Word; they turned their backs on Him as Guru.<BR>
 These evil-hearted ones became rebellious; they carry loads of sin on their backs.<BR>
 Whatever the Guru said, Lehna did, and so he was installed on the throne.<BR>
 Who has lost, and who has won? ||2||<BR>
 He who did the work, is accepted as Guru; so which is better - the thistle or the rice?<BR>
 The Righteous Judge of Dharma considered the arguments and made the decision.<BR>
 Whatever the True Guru says, the True Lord does; it comes to pass instantaneously.<BR>
 Guru Angad was proclaimed, and the True Creator confirmed it.<BR>
 Nanak merely changed his body; He still sits on the throne, with hundreds of branches reaching out.<BR>
 Standing at His door, His followers serve Him; by this service, their rust is scraped off.<BR>
 He is the Dervish - the Saint, at the door of His Lord and Master; He loves the True Name, and the Bani of the Guru's Word.<BR>
 Balwand says that Khivi, the Guru's wife, is a noble woman, who gives soothing, leafy shade to all.<BR>
 She distributes the bounty of the Guru's Langar; the kheer - the rice pudding and ghee, is like sweet ambrosia.<BR>
 The faces of the Guru's Sikhs are radiant and bright; the self-willed manmukhs are pale, like straw.<BR>
 The Master gave His approval, when Angad exerted Himself heroically.<BR>
 Such is the Husband of mother Khivi; He sustains the world. ||3||<BR>
 It is as if the Guru made the Ganges flow in the opposite direction, and the world wonders: what has he done?<BR>
 Nanak, the Lord, the Lord of the World, spoke the words out loud.<BR>
 Making the mountain his churning stick, and the snake-king his churning string, He has churned the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 From it, He extracted the fourteen jewels, and illuminated the world.<BR>
 He revealed such creative power, and touched such greatness.<BR>
 He raised the royal canopy to wave over the head of Lehna, and raised His glory to the skies.<BR>
 His Light merged into the Light, and He blended Him into Himself.<BR>
 Guru Nanak tested His Sikhs and His sons, and everyone saw what happened.<BR>
 When Lehna alone was found to be pure, then He was set on the throne. ||4||<BR>
 Then, the True Guru, the son of Pheru, came to dwell at Khadoor.<BR>
 Meditation, austerities and self-discipline rest with You, while the others are filled with excessive pride.<BR>
 Greed ruins mankind, like the green algae in the water.<BR>
 In the Guru's Court, the Divine Light shines in its creative power.<BR>
 You are the cooling peace, whose depth cannot be found.<BR>
 You are overflowing with the nine treasures, and the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 Whoever slanders You will be totally ruined and destroyed.<BR>
 People of the world can see only what is near at hand, but You can see far beyond.<BR>
 Then the True Guru, the son of Pheru, came to dwell at Khadoor. ||5||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 093</H2></CENTER>
 The same mark on the forehead, the same throne, and the same Royal Court.<BR>
 Just like the father and grandfather, the son is approved.<BR>
 He took the thousand-headed serpent as his churning string, and with the force of devotional love, he churned the ocean of the world with his churning stick, the Sumayr mountain.<BR>
 He extracted the fourteen jewels, and brought forth the Divine Light.<BR>
 He made intuition his horse, and chastity his saddle.<BR>
 He placed the arrow of the Lord's Praise in the bow of Truth.<BR>
 In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, there was only pitch darkness. Then, He rose like the sun to illuminate the darkness.<BR>
 He farms the field of Truth, and spreads out the canopy of Truth.<BR>
 Your kitchen always has ghee and flour to eat.<BR>
 You understand the four corners of the universe; in your mind, the Word of the Shabad is approved and supreme.<BR>
 You eliminate the comings and goings of reincarnation, and bestow the insignia of Your Glance of Grace.<BR>
 You are the Avataar, the Incarnation of the all-knowing Primal Lord.<BR>
 You are not pushed or shaken by the storm and the wind; you are like the Sumayr Mountain.<BR>
 You know the inner state of the soul; You are the Knower of knowers.<BR>
 How can I praise You, O True Supreme King, when You are so wise and all-knowing?<BR>
 Those blessings granted by the Pleasure of the True Guru - please bless Satta with those gifts.<BR>
 Seeing Nanak's canopy waving over Your head, everyone was astonished.<BR>
 The same mark on the forehead, the same throne, and the same Royal Court.<BR>
 Just like the father and grandfather, the son is approved. ||6||<BR>
 Blessed, blessed is Guru Raam Daas; He who created You, has also exalted You.<BR>
 Perfect is Your miracle; the Creator Lord Himself has installed You on the throne.<BR>
 The Sikhs and all the Congregation recognize You as the Supreme Lord God, and bow down to You.<BR>
 You are unchanging, unfathomable and immeasurable; You have no end or limitation.<BR>
 Those who serve You with love - You carry them across.<BR>
 Greed, envy, sexual desire, anger and emotional attachment - You have beaten them and driven them out.<BR>
 Blessed is Your place, and True is Your magnificent glory.<BR>
 You are Nanak, You are Angad, and You are Amar Daas; so do I recognize You.<BR>
 When I saw the Guru, then my mind was comforted and consoled. ||7||<BR>
 The four Gurus enlightened the four ages; the Lord Himself assumed the fifth form.<BR>
 He created Himself, and He Himself is the supporting pillar.<BR>
 He Himself is the paper, He Himself is the pen, and He Himself is the writer.<BR>
 All His followers come and go; He alone is fresh and new.<BR>
 Guru Arjun sits on the throne; the royal canopy waves over the True Guru.<BR>
 From east to west, He illuminates the four directions.<BR>
 Those self-willed manmukhs who do not serve the Guru die in shame.<BR>
 Your miracles increase two-fold, even four-fold; this is the True Lord's true blessing.<BR>
 The four Gurus enlightened the four ages; the Lord Himself assumed the fifth form. ||8||1||<BR>
 Raamkalee, The Word Of The Devotees.<BR>
 Kabeer Jee:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Make your body the vat, and mix in the yeast. Let the Word of the Guru's Shabad be the molasses.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 094</H2></CENTER>
 Cut up desire, sexuality, anger, pride and envy, and let them be the fermenting bark. ||1||<BR>
 Is there any Saint, with intuitive peace and poise deep within, unto whom I might offer my meditation and austerities as payment?<BR>
 I dedicate my body and mind to whoever gives me even a drop of this wine from such a vat. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I have made the fourteen worlds the furnace, and I have burnt my body with the fire of God.<BR>
 My mudra - my hand-gesture, is the pipe; tuning into the celestial sound current within, the Shushmanaa - the central spinal channel, is my cooling pad. ||2||<BR>
 Pilgrimages, fasting, vows, purifications, self-discipline, austerities and breath control through the sun and moon channels - all these I pledge.<BR>
 My focused consciousness is the cup, and the Ambrosial Nectar is the pure juice. I drink in the supreme, sublime essence of this juice. ||3||<BR>
 The pure stream constantly trickles forth, and my mind is intoxicated by this sublime essence.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, all other wines are trivial and tasteless; this is the only true, sublime essence. ||4||1||<BR>
 Make spiritual wisdom the molasses, meditation the flowers, and the Fear of God the fire enshrined in your mind.<BR>
 The Shushmanaa, the central spinal channel, is intuitively balanced, and the drinker drinks in this wine. ||1||<BR>
 O hermit Yogi, my mind is intoxicated.<BR>
 When that wine rises up, one tastes the sublime essence of this juice, and sees across the three worlds. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Joining the two channels of the breath, I have lit the furnace, and I drink in the supreme, sublime essence.<BR>
 I have burnt both sexual desire and anger, and I have been emancipated from the world. ||2||<BR>
 The light of spiritual wisdom enlightens me; meeting with the Guru, the True Guru, I have obtained this understanding.<BR>
 Slave Kabeer is intoxicated with that wine, which never wears off. ||3||2||<BR>
 You are my Sumayr Mountain, O my Lord and Master; I have grasped Your Support.<BR>
 You do not shake, and I do not fall. You have preserved my honor. ||1||<BR>
 Now and then, here and there, You, only You.<BR>
 By Your Grace, I am forever in peace. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Relying upon You, I can live even in the cursed place of Magahar; You have put out the fire of my body.<BR>
 First, I obtained the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan in Magahar; then, I came to dwell at Benares. ||2||<BR>
 As is Magahar, so is Benares; I see them as one and the same.<BR>
 I am poor, but I have obtained this wealth of the Lord; the proud are bursting with pride, and die. ||3||<BR>
 One who takes pride in himself is stuck with thorns; no one can pull them out.<BR>
 Here, he cries bitterly, and hereafter, he burns in the most hideous hell. ||4||<BR>
 What is hell, and what is heaven? The Saints reject them both.<BR>
 I have no obligation to either of them, by the Grace of my Guru. ||5||<BR>
 Now, I have mounted to the throne of the Lord; I have met the Lord, the Sustainer of the World.<BR>
 The Lord and Kabeer have become one. No one can tell them apart. ||6||3||<BR>
 I honor and obey the Saints, and punish the wicked; this is my duty as God's police officer.<BR>
 Day and night, I wash Your feet, Lord; I wave my hair as the chauree, to brush away the flies. ||1||<BR>
 I am a dog at Your Court, Lord.<BR>
 I open my snout and bark before it. ||1||Pause||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 095</H2></CENTER>
 In my past life, I was Your servant; now, I cannot leave You.<BR>
 The celestial sound current resounds at Your Door. Your insignia is stamped upon my forehead. ||2||<BR>
 Those who are branded with Your brand fight bravely in battle; those without Your brand run away.<BR>
 One who becomes a Holy person, appreciates the value of devotional worship to the Lord. The Lord places him in His treasury. ||3||<BR>
 In the fortress is the chamber; by contemplative meditation it becomes the supreme chamber.<BR>
 The Guru has blessed Kabeer with the commodity, saying, "Take this commodity; cherish it and keep it secure."||4||<BR>
 Kabeer gives it to the world, but he alone receives it, upon whose forehead such destiny is recorded.<BR>
 Permanent is the marriage, of one who receives this ambrosial essence. ||5||4||<BR>
 O Brahmin, how can you forget the One, from whose mouth the Vedas and the Gayitri prayer issured forth?<BR>
 The whole world falls at His feet; why don't you chant the Name of that Lord, O Pandit? ||1||<BR>
 Why, O my Brahmin, do you not chant the Lord's Name?<BR>
 If you don't chant the Lord's Name, O Pandit, you will only suffer in hell. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 You think that you are high, but you take food from the houses of the lowly; you fill up your belly by forcibly practicing your rituals.<BR>
 On the fourteenth day, and the night of the new moon, you go out begging; even though you hold the lamp in your hands, still, you fall into the pit. ||2||<BR>
 You are a Brahmin, and I am only a weaver from Benares. How can I compare to you?<BR>
 Chanting the Lord's Name, I have been saved; relying on the Vedas, O Brahmin, you shall drown and die. ||3||5||<BR>
 There is a single tree, with countless branches and twigs; its flowers and leaves are filled with its juice.<BR>
 This world is a garden of Ambrosial Nectar. The Perfect Lord created it. ||1||<BR>
 I have come to know the story of my Sovereign Lord.<BR>
 How rare is that Gurmukh who knows, and whose inner being is illumined by the Lord's Light. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The bumble bee, addicted to the nectar of the twelve-petalled flowers, enshrines it in the heart.<BR>
 He holds his breath suspended in the sixteen-petalled sky of the Akaashic Ethers, and beats his wings in esctasy. ||2||<BR>
 In the profound void of intuitive Samaadhi, the one tree rises up; it soaks up the water of desire from the ground.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, I am the servant of those who have seen this celestial tree. ||3||6||<BR>
 Make silence your ear-rings, and compassion your wallet; let meditation be your begging bowl.<BR>
 Sew this body as your patched coat, and take the Lord's Name as your support. ||1||<BR>
 Practice such Yoga, O Yogi.<BR>
 As Gurmukh, enjoy meditation, austerities and self-discipline. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Apply the ashes of wisdom to your body; let your horn be your focused consciousness.<BR>
 Become detached, and wander through the city of your body; play the harp of your mind. ||2||<BR>
 Enshrine the five tatvas - the five elements, within your heart; let your deep meditative trance be undisturbed.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints: make righteousness and compassion your garden. ||3||7||<BR>
 For what purpose were you created and brought into the world? What rewards have you received in this life?<BR>
 God is the boat to carry you across the terrifying world-ocean; He is the Fulfiller of the mind's desires. You have not centered your mind on Him, even for an instant. ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 096</H2></CENTER>
 O Lord of the Universe, I am such a sinner!<BR>
 God gave me body and soul, but I have not practiced loving devotional worship to Him. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Others' wealth, others' bodies, others' wives, others' slander and others' fights - I have not given them up.<BR>
 For the sake of these, coming and going in reincarnation happens over and over again, and this story never ends. ||2||<BR>
 That house, in which the Saints speak of the Lord - I have not visited it, even for an instant.<BR>
 Drunkards, thieves, and evil-doers - I constantly dwell with them. ||3||<BR>
 Sexual desire, anger, the wine of Maya, and envy - these are what I collect within myself.<BR>
 Compassion, righteousness, and service to the Guru - these do not visit me, even in my dreams. ||4||<BR>
 He is merciful to the meek, compassionate and benevolent, the Lover of His devotees, the Destroyer of fear.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, please protect Your humble servant from disaster; O Lord, I serve only You. ||5||8||<BR>
 Remembering Him in meditation, the door of liberation is found.<BR>
 You shall go to heaven, and not return to this earth.<BR>
 In the home of the Fearless Lord, the celestial trumpets resound.<BR>
 The unstruck sound current will vibrate and resonate forever. ||1||<BR>
 Practice such meditative remembrance in your mind.<BR>
 Without this meditative remembrance, liberation will never be found. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Remembering Him in meditation, you will meet with no obstruction.<BR>
 You will be liberated, and the great load will be taken away.<BR>
 Bow in humility within your heart,<BR>
 and you will not have to be reincarnated over and over again. ||2||<BR>
 Remember Him in meditation, celebrate and be happy.<BR>
 God has placed His lamp deep within you, which burns without any oil.<BR>
 That lamp makes the world immortal;<BR>
 it conquers and drives out the poisons of sexual desire and anger. ||3||<BR>
 Remembering Him in meditation, you shall obtain salvation.<BR>
 Wear that meditative remembrance as your necklace.<BR>
 Practice that meditative remembrance, and never let it go.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, you shall cross over. ||4||<BR>
 Remembering Him in meditation, you shall not be obligated to others.<BR>
 You shall sleep in your mansion, in blankets of silk.<BR>
 Your soul shall blossom forth in happiness, on this comfortable bed.<BR>
 So drink in this meditative remembrance, night and day. ||5||<BR>
 Remembering Him in meditation, your troubles will depart.<BR>
 Remembering Him in meditation, Maya will not bother you.<BR>
 Meditate, meditate in remembrance on the Lord, Har, Har, and sing His Praises in your mind.<BR>
 This meditative remembrance is obtained from the True Guru. ||6||<BR>
 Forever and ever, remember Him, day and night,<BR>
 while standing up and sitting down, with every breath and morsel of food.<BR>
 While awake and asleep, enjoy the essence of this meditative remembrance.<BR>
 The Lord's meditative remembrance is obtained by good destiny. ||7||<BR>
 Remembering Him in meditation, you shall not be loaded down.<BR>
 Make this meditative remembrance of the Lord's Name your Support.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, He has no limits;<BR>
 no tantras or mantras can be used against Him. ||8||9||<BR>
 Raamkalee, Second House, The Word Of Kabeer Jee:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Maya, the Trapper, has sprung her trap.<BR>
 The Guru, the Liberated One, has put out the fire.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 097</H2></CENTER>
 When I came to understand this mind, from the tips of my toes to the crown of my head,<BR>
 then I took my cleansing bath, deep within my self. ||1||<BR>
 The mind, the master of the breath, abides in the state of supreme bliss.<BR>
 There is no death, no re-birth, and no aging for me now. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Turning away from materialism, I have found intuitive support.<BR>
 I have entered into the sky of the mind, and opened the Tenth Gate.<BR>
 The chakras of the coiled Kundalini energy have been opened,<BR>
 and I have met my Sovereign Lord King without fear. ||2||<BR>
 My attachment to Maya has been eradicated;<BR>
 the moon energy has devoured the sun energy.<BR>
 When I was focused and merged into the all-pervading Lord,<BR>
 then the unstruck sound current began to vibrate. ||3||<BR>
 The Speaker has spoken, and proclaimed the Word of the Shabad.<BR>
 The hearer has heard, and enshrined it in the mind.<BR>
 Chanting to the Creator, one crosses over.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, this is the essence. ||4||1||10||<BR>
 The moon and the sun are both the embodiment of light.<BR>
 Within their light, is God, the incomparable. ||1||<BR>
 O spiritual teacher, contemplate God.<BR>
 In this light is contained the expanse of the created universe. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Gazing upon the diamond, I humbly salute this diamond.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, the Immaculate Lord is indescribable. ||2||2||11||<BR>
 People of the world, remain awake and aware. Even though you are awake, you are being robbed, O Siblings of Destiny.<BR>
 While the Vedas stand guard watching, the Messenger of Death carries you away. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He thinks that the bitter nimm fruit is a mango, and the mango is a bitter nimm. He imagines the ripe banana on the thorny bush.<BR>
 He thinks that the ripe coconut hangs on the barren simmal tree; what a stupid, idiotic fool he is! ||1||<BR>
 The Lord is like sugar, spilled onto the sand; the elephant cannot pick it up.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, give up your ancestry, social status and honor; be like the tiny ant - pick up and eat the sugar. ||2||3||12||<BR>
 The Word Of Naam Dayv Jee, Raamkalee, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The boy takes paper, cuts it and makes a kite, and flies it in the sky.<BR>
 Talking with his friends, he still keeps his attention on the kite string. ||1||<BR>
 My mind has been pierced by the Name of the Lord,<BR>
 like the goldsmith, whose attention is held by his work. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The young girl in the city takes a pitcher, and fills it with water.<BR>
 She laughs, and plays, and talks with her friends, but she keeps her attention focused on the pitcher of water. ||2||<BR>
 The cow is let loose, out of the mansion of the ten gates, to graze in the field.<BR>
 It grazes up to five miles away, but keeps its attention focused on its calf. ||3||<BR>
 Says Naam Dayv, listen, O Trilochan: the child is laid down in the cradle.<BR>
 Its mother is at work, inside and outside, but she holds her child in her thoughts. ||4||1||<BR>
 There are countless Vedas, Puraanas and Shaastras; I do not sing their songs and hymns.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 098</H2></CENTER>
 In the imperishable realm of the Formless Lord, I play the flute of the unstruck sound current. ||1||<BR>
 Becoming detached, I sing the Lord's Praises.<BR>
 Imbued with the unattached, unstruck Word of the Shabad, I shall go to the home of the Lord, who has no ancestors. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Then, I shall no longer control the breath through the energy channels of the Ida, Pingala and Shushmanaa.<BR>
 I look upon both the moon and the sun as the same, and I shall merge in the Light of God. ||2||<BR>
 I do not go to see sacred shrines of pilgrimage, or bathe in their waters; I do not bother any beings or creatures.<BR>
 The Guru has shown me the sixty-eight places of pilgrimage within my own heart, where I now take my cleansing bath. ||3||<BR>
 I do not pay attention to anyone praising me, or calling me good and nice.<BR>
 Says Naam Dayv, my consciousness is imbued with the Lord; I am absorbed in the profound state of Samaadhi. ||4||2||<BR>
 When there was no mother and no father, no karma and no human body,<BR>
 when I was not and you were not, then who came from where? ||1||<BR>
 O Lord, no one belongs to anyone else.<BR>
 We are like birds perched on a tree. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 When there was no moon and no sun, then water and air were blended together.<BR>
 When there were no Shaastras and no Vedas, then where did karma come from? ||2||<BR>
 Control of the breath and positioning of the tongue, focusing at the third eye and wearing malas of tulsi beads, are all obtained through Guru's Grace.<BR>
 Naam Dayv prays, this is the supreme essence of reality; the True Guru has inspired this realization. ||3||3||<BR>
 RAAMKALEE, SECOND HOUSE:<BR>
 Someone may practice austerities at Benares, or die upside-down at a sacred shrine ofpilgrimage, or burn his body in fire, or rejuvenate his body to life almost forever;<BR>
 he may perform the horse-sacrifice ceremony, or give donations of gold covered over, but none of these is equal to the worship of the Lord's Name. ||1||<BR>
 O hypocrite, renounce and abandon your hypocrisy; do not practice deception.<BR>
 Constantly, continually, chant the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Someone may go to the Ganges or the Godaavari, or to the Kumbha festival, or bathe at Kaydaar Naat'h, or make donations of thousands of cows at Gomti;<BR>
 he may make millions of pilgrimages to sacred shrines, or freeze his body in the Himalayas; still, none of these is equal to the worship of the Lord's Name. ||2||<BR>
 Someone may give away horses and elephants, or women on their beds, or land; he may give such gifts over and over again.<BR>
 He may purify his soul, and give away in charity his body weight in gold; none of these is equal to the worship of the Lord's Name. ||3||<BR>
 Do not harbor anger in your mind, or blame the Messenger of Death; instead, realize the immaculate state of Nirvaanaa.<BR>
 My Sovereign Lord King is Raam Chandra, the Son of the King Dasrat'h; prays Naam Dayv, I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||4||4||<BR>
 Raamkalee, The Word Of Ravi Daas Jee:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 They read and reflect upon all the Names of God; they listen, but they do not see the Lord, the embodiment of love and intuition.<BR>
 How can iron be transformed into gold, unless it touches the Philosopher's Stone? ||1||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 22 - Raag Raamkalee - Part 099</H2></CENTER>
 O Divine Lord, the knot of skepticism cannot be untied.<BR>
 Sexual desire, anger, Maya, intoxication and jealousy - these five have combined to plunder the world. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I am a great poet, of noble heritage; I am a Pandit, a religious scholar, a Yogi and a Sannyaasi;<BR>
 I am a spiritual teacher, a warrior and a giver - such thinking never ends. ||2||<BR>
 Says Ravi Daas, no one understands; they all run around, deluded like madmen.<BR>
 The Lord's Name is my only Support; He is my life, my breath of life, my wealth. ||3||1||<BR>
 Raamkalee, The Word Of Baynee Jee:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The energy channels of the Ida, Pingala and Shushmanaa: these three dwell in one place.<BR>
 This is the true place of confluence of the three sacred rivers: this is where my mind takes its cleansing bath. ||1||<BR>
 O Saints, the Immaculate Lord dwells there;<BR>
 how rare are those who go to the Guru, and understand this.<BR>
 The all-pervading immaculate Lord is there. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 What is the insignia of the Divine Lord's dwelling?<BR>
 The unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates there.<BR>
 There is no moon or sun, no air or water there.<BR>
 The Gurmukh becomes aware, and knows the Teachings. ||2||<BR>
 Spiritual wisdom wells up, and evil-mindedness departs;<BR>
 the nucleus of the mind sky is drenched with Ambrosial Nectar.<BR>
 One who knows the secret of this device,<BR>
 meets the Supreme Divine Guru. ||3||<BR>
 The Tenth Gate is the home of the inaccessible, infinite Supreme Lord.<BR>
 Above the store is a niche, and within this niche is the commodity. ||4||<BR>
 One who remains awake, never sleeps.<BR>
 The three qualities and the three worlds vanish, in the state of Samaadhi.<BR>
 He takes the Beej Mantra, the Seed Mantra, and keeps it in his heart.<BR>
 Turning his mind away from the world, he focuses on the cosmic void of the absolute Lord. ||5||<BR>
 He remains awake, and he does not lie.<BR>
 He keeps the five sensory organs under his control.<BR>
 He cherishes in his consciousness the Guru's Teachings.<BR>
 He dedicates his mind and body to the Lord's Love. ||6||<BR>
 He considers his hands to be the leaves and branches of the tree.<BR>
 He does not lose his life in the gamble.<BR>
 He plugs up the source of the river of evil tendencies.<BR>
 Turning away from the west, he makes the sun rise in the east.<BR>
 He bears the unbearable, and the drops trickle down within;<BR>
 then, he speaks with the Lord of the world. ||7||<BR>
 The four-sided lamp illuminates the Tenth Gate.<BR>
 The Primal Lord is at the center of the countless leaves.<BR>
 He Himself abides there with all His powers.<BR>
 He weaves the jewels into the pearl of the mind. ||8||<BR>
 The lotus is at the forehead, and the jewels surround it.<BR>
 Within it is the Immaculate Lord, the Master of the three worlds.<BR>
 The Panch Shabad, the five primal sounds, resound and vibrate their in their purity.<BR>
 The chauris - the fly brushes wave, and the conch shells blare like thunder.<BR>
 The Gurmukh tramples the demons underfoot with his spiritual wisdom.<BR>
 Baynee longs for Your Name, Lord. ||9||1||<BR>
