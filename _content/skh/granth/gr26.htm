 Tukhaari Chhant, First Mehl, Baarah Maahaa ~ The Twelve Months:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Listen: according to the karma of their past actions, each and every person experiences happiness or sorrow; whatever You give, Lord, is good.<BR>
 O Lord, the Created Universe is Yours; what is my condition? Without the Lord, I cannot survive, even for an instant.<BR>
 Without my Beloved, I am miserable; I have no friend at all. As Gurmukh, I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar.<BR>
 The Formless Lord is contained in His Creation. To obey God is the best course of action.<BR>
 O Nanak, the soul-bride is gazing upon Your Path; please listen, O Supreme Soul. ||1||<BR>
 The rainbird cries out, "Pri-o! Beloved!", and the song-bird sings the Lord's Bani.<BR>
 The soul-bride enjoys all the pleasures, and merges in the Being of her Beloved.<BR>
 She merges into the Being of her Beloved, when she becomes pleasing to God; she is the happy, blessed soul-bride.<BR>
 Establishing the nine houses, and the Royal Mansion of the Tenth Gate above them, the Lord dwells in that home deep within the self.<BR>
 All are Yours, You are my Beloved; night and day, I celebrate Your Love.<BR>
 O Nanak, the rainbird cries out, "Pri-o! Pri-o! Beloved! Beloved!" The song-bird is embellished with the Word of the Shabad. ||2||<BR>
 Please listen, O my Beloved Lord - I am drenched with Your Love.<BR>
 My mind and body are absorbed in dwelling on You; I cannot forget You, even for an instant.<BR>
 How could I forget You, even for an instant? I am a sacrifice to You; singing Your Glorious Praises, I live.<BR>
 No one is mine; unto whom do I belong? Without the Lord, I cannot survive.<BR>
 I have grasped the Support of the Lord's Feet; dwelling there, my body has become immaculate.<BR>
 O Nanak, I have obtained profound insight, and found peace; my mind is comforted by the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||3||<BR>
 The Ambrosial Nectar rains down on us! Its drops are so delightful!<BR>
 Meeting the Guru, the Best Friend, with intuitive ease, the mortal falls in love with the Lord.<BR>
 The Lord comes into the temple of the body, when it pleases God's Will; the soul-bride rises up, and sings His Glorious Praises.<BR>
 In each and every home, the Husband Lord ravishes and enjoys the happy soul-brides; so why has He forgotten me?<BR>
 The sky is overcast with heavy, low-hanging clouds; the rain is delightful, and my Beloved's Love is pleasing to my mind and body.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Ambrosial Nectar of Gurbani rains down; the Lord, in His Grace, has come into the home of my heart. ||4||<BR>
 In the month of Chayt, the lovely spring has come, and the bumble bees hum with joy.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 26 - Raag Tukhaari - Part 002</H2></CENTER>
 The forest is blossoming in front of my door; if only my Beloved would return to my home!<BR>
 If her Husband Lord does not return home, how can the soul-bride find peace? Her body is wasting away with the sorrow of separation.<BR>
 The beautiful song-bird sings, perched on the mango tree; but how can I endure the pain in the depths of my being?<BR>
 The bumble bee is buzzing around the flowering branches; but how can I survive? I am dying, O my mother!<BR>
 O Nanak, in Chayt, peace is easily obtained, if the soul-bride obtains the Lord as her Husband, within the home of her own heart. ||5||<BR>
 Baisakhi is so pleasant; the branches blossom with new leaves.<BR>
 The soul-bride yearns to see the Lord at her door. Come, O Lord, and take pity on me!<BR>
 Please come home, O my Beloved; carry me across the treacherous world-ocean. Without You, I am not worth even a shell.<BR>
 Who can estimate my worth, if I am pleasing to You? I see You, and inspire others to see You, O my Love.<BR>
 I know that You are not far away; I believe that You are deep within me, and I realize Your Presence.<BR>
 O Nanak, finding God in Baisakhi, the consciousness is filled with the Word of the Shabad, and the mind comes to believe. ||6||<BR>
 The month of Jayt'h is so sublime. How could I forget my Beloved?<BR>
 The earth burns like a furnace, and the soul-bride offers her prayer.<BR>
 The bride offers her prayer, and sings His Glorious Praises; singing His Praises, she becomes pleasing to God.<BR>
 The Unattached Lord dwells in His true mansion. If He allows me, then I will come to Him.<BR>
 The bride is dishonored and powerless; how will she find peace without her Lord?<BR>
 O Nanak, in Jayt'h, she who knows her Lord becomes just like Him; grasping virtue, she meets with the Merciful Lord. ||7||<BR>
 The month of Aasaarh is good; the sun blazes in the sky.<BR>
 The earth suffers in pain, parched and roasted in the fire.<BR>
 The fire dries up the moisture, and she dies in agony. But even then, the sun does not grow tired.<BR>
 His chariot moves on, and the soul-bride seeks shade; the crickets are chirping in the forest.<BR>
 She ties up her bundle of faults and demerits, and suffers in the world hereafter. But dwelling on the True Lord, she finds peace.<BR>
 O Nanak, I have given this mind to Him; death and life rest with God. ||8||<BR>
 In Saawan, be happy, O my mind. The rainy season has come, and the clouds have burst into showers.<BR>
 My mind and body are pleased by my Lord, but my Beloved has gone away.<BR>
 My Beloved has not come home, and I am dying of the sorrow of separation. The lightning flashes, and I am scared.<BR>
 My bed is lonely, and I am suffering in agony. I am dying in pain, O my mother!<BR>
 Tell me - without the Lord, how can I sleep, or feel hungry? My clothes give no comfort to my body.<BR>
 O Nanak, she alone is a happy soul-bride, who merges in the Being of her Beloved Husband Lord. ||9||<BR>
 In Bhaadon, the young woman is confused by doubt; later, she regrets and repents.<BR>
 The lakes and fields are overflowing with water; the rainy season has come - the time to celebrate!<BR>
 In the dark of night it rains; how can the young bride find peace? The frogs and peacocks send out their noisy calls.<BR>
 "Pri-o! Pri-o! Beloved! Beloved!" cries the rainbird, while the snakes slither around, biting.<BR>
 The mosquitoes bite and sting, and the ponds are filled to overflowing; without the Lord, how can she find peace?<BR>
 O Nanak, I will go and ask my Guru; wherever God is, there I will go. ||10||<BR>
 In Assu, come, my Beloved; the soul-bride is grieving to death.<BR>
 She can only meet Him, when God leads her to meet Him; she is ruined by the love of duality.<BR>
 If she is plundered by falsehood, then her Beloved forsakes her. Then, the white flowers of old age blossom in my hair.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 26 - Raag Tukhaari - Part 003</H2></CENTER>
 Summer is now behind us, and the winter season is ahead. Gazing upon this play, my shaky mind wavers.<BR>
 In all ten directions, the branches are green and alive. That which ripens slowly, is sweet.<BR>
 O Nanak, in Assu, please meet me, my Beloved. The True Guru has become my Advocate and Friend. ||11||<BR>
 In Katak, that alone comes to pass, which is pleasing to the Will of God.<BR>
 The lamp of intuition burns, lit by the essence of reality.<BR>
 Love is the oil in the lamp, which unites the soul-bride with her Lord. The bride is delighted, in ecstasy.<BR>
 One who dies in faults and demerits - her death is not successful. But one who dies in glorious virtue, really truly dies.<BR>
 Those who are blessed with devotional worship of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, sit in the home of their own inner being. They place their hopes in You.<BR>
 Nanak: please open the shutters of Your Door, O Lord, and meet me. A single moment is like six months to me. ||12||<BR>
 The month of Maghar is good, for those who sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and merge in His Being.<BR>
 The virtuous wife utters His Glorious Praises; my Beloved Husband Lord is Eternal and Unchanging.<BR>
 The Primal Lord is Unmoving and Unchanging, Clever and Wise; all the world is fickle.<BR>
 By virtue of spiritual wisdom and meditation, she merges in His Being; she is pleasing to God, and He is pleasing to her.<BR>
 I have heard the songs and the music, and the poems of the poets; but only the Name of the Lord takes away my pain.<BR>
 O Nanak, that soul-bride is pleasing to her Husband Lord, who performs loving devotional worship before her Beloved. ||13||<BR>
 In Poh, the snow falls, and the sap of the trees and the fields dries up.<BR>
 Why have You not come? I keep You in my mind, body and mouth.<BR>
 He is permeating and pervading my mind and body; He is the Life of the World. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I enjoy His Love.<BR>
 His Light fills all those born of eggs, born from the womb, born of sweat and born of the earth, each and every heart.<BR>
 Grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, O Lord of Mercy and Compassion. O Great Giver, grant me understanding, that I might find salvation.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Lord enjoys, savors and ravishes the bride who is in love with Him. ||14||<BR>
 In Maagh, I become pure; I know that the sacred shrine of pilgrimage is within me.<BR>
 I have met my Friend with intuitive ease; I grasp His Glorious Virtues, and merge in His Being.<BR>
 O my Beloved, Beauteous Lord God, please listen: I sing Your Glories, and merge in Your Being. If it is pleasing to Your Will, I bathe in the sacred pool within.<BR>
 The Ganges, Jamunaa, the sacred meeting place of the three rivers, the seven seas, charity, donations, adoration and worship all rest in the Transcendent Lord God; throughout the ages, I realize the One.<BR>
 O Nanak, in Maagh, the most sublime essence is meditation on the Lord; this is the cleansing bath of the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage. ||15||<BR>
 In Phalgun, her mind is enraptured, pleased by the Love of her Beloved.<BR>
 Night and day, she is enraptured, and her selfishness is gone.<BR>
 Emotional attachment is eradicated from her mind, when it pleases Him; in His Mercy, He comes to my home.<BR>
 I dress in various clothes, but without my Beloved, I shall not find a place in the Mansion of His Presence.<BR>
 I have adorned myself with garlands of flowers, pearl necklaces, scented oils and silk robes.<BR>
 O Nanak, the Guru has united me with Him. The soul-bride has found her Husband Lord, within the home of her own heart. ||16||<BR>
 The twelve months, the seasons, the weeks, the days, the hours, the minutes and the seconds are all sublime, when the True Lord comes and meets her with natural ease.<BR>
 God, my Beloved, has met me, and my affairs are all resolved. The Creator Lord knows all ways and means.<BR>
 I am loved by the One who has embellished and exalted me; I have met Him, and I savor His Love.<BR>
 The bed of my heart becomes beautiful, when my Husband Lord ravishes me. As Gurmukh, the destiny on my forehead has been awakened and activated.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 26 - Raag Tukhaari - Part 004</H2></CENTER>
 O Nanak, day and night, my Beloved enjoys me; with the Lord as my Husband, my Marriage is Eternal. ||17||1||<BR>
 Tukhaari, First Mehl:<BR>
 In the first watch of the dark night, O bride of splendored eyes,<BR>
 protect your riches; your turn is coming soon.<BR>
 When your turn comes, who will wake you? While you sleep, your juice shall be sucked out by the Messenger of Death.<BR>
 The night is so dark; what will become of your honor? The thieves will break into your home and rob you.<BR>
 O Saviour Lord, Inaccessible and Infinite, please hear my prayer.<BR>
 O Nanak, the fool never remembers Him; what can he see in the dark of night? ||1||<BR>
 The second watch has begun; wake up, you unconscious being!<BR>
 Protect your riches, O mortal; your farm is being eaten.<BR>
 Protect your crops, and love the Lord, the Guru. Stay awake and aware, and the thieves shall not rob you.<BR>
 You shall not have to go on the path of Death, and you shall not suffer in pain; your fear and terror of death shall run away.<BR>
 The lamps of the sun and the moon are lit by the Guru's Teachings, through His Door, meditating on the True Lord, in the mind and with the mouth.<BR>
 O Nanak, the fool still does not remember the Lord. How can he find peace in duality? ||2||<BR>
 The third watch has begun, and sleep has set in.<BR>
 The mortal suffers in pain, from attachment to Maya, children and spouse.<BR>
 Maya, his children, his wife and the world are so dear to him; he bites the bait, and is caught.<BR>
 Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he shall find peace; following the Guru's Teachings, he shall not be seized by death.<BR>
 He cannot escape from birth, dying and death; without the Name, he suffers.<BR>
 O Nanak, in the third watch of the three-phased Maya, the world is engrossed in attachment to Maya. ||3||<BR>
 The fourth watch has begun, and the day is about to dawn.<BR>
 Those who remain awake and aware, night and day, preserve and protect their homes.<BR>
 The night is pleasant and peaceful, for those who remain awake; following the Guru's advice, they focus on the Naam.<BR>
 Those who practice the Word of the Guru's Shabad are not reincarnated again; the Lord God is their Best Friend.<BR>
 The hands shake, the feet and body totter, the vision goes dark, and the body turns to dust.<BR>
 O Nanak, people are miserable throughout the four ages, if the Name of the Lord does not abide in the mind. ||4||<BR>
 The knot has been untied; rise up - the order has come!<BR>
 Pleasures and comforts are gone; like a prisoner, you are driven on.<BR>
 You shall be bound and gagged, when it pleases God; you will not see or hear it coming.<BR>
 Everyone will have their turn; the crop ripens, and then it is cut down.<BR>
 The account is kept for every second, every instant; the soul suffers for the bad and the good.<BR>
 O Nanak, the angelic beings are united with the Word of the Shabad; this is the way God made it. ||5||2||<BR>
 Tukhaari, First Mehl:<BR>
 The meteor shoots across the sky. How can it be seen with the eyes?<BR>
 The True Guru reveals the Word of the Shabad to His servant who has such perfect karma.<BR>
 The Guru reveals the Shabad; dwelling on the True Lord, day and night, he beholds and reflects on God.<BR>
 The five restless desires are restrained, and he knows the home of his own heart. He conquers sexual desire, anger and corruption.<BR>
 His inner being is illuminated, by the Guru's Teachings; He beholds the Lord's play of karma.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 26 - Raag Tukhaari - Part 005</H2></CENTER>
 O Nanak, killing his ego, he is satisfied; the meteor has shot across the sky. ||1||<BR>
 The Gurmukhs remain awake and aware; their egotistical pride is eradicated.<BR>
 Night and day, it is dawn for them; they merge in the True Lord.<BR>
 The Gurmukhs are merged in the True Lord; they are pleasing to His Mind. The Gurmukhs are intact, safe and sound, awake and awake.<BR>
 The Guru blesses them with the Ambrosial Nectar of the True Name; they are lovingly attuned to the Lord's Feet.<BR>
 The Divine Light is revealed, and in that Light, they achieve realization; the self-willed manmukhs wander in doubt and confusion.<BR>
 O Nanak, when the dawn breaks, their minds are satisfied; they pass their life-night awake and aware. ||2||<BR>
 Forgetting faults and demerits, virtue and merit enter one's home.<BR>
 The One Lord is permeating everywhere; there is no other at all.<BR>
 He is All-pervading; there is no other. The mind comes to believe, from the mind.<BR>
 The One who established the water, the land, the three worlds, each and every heart - that God is known by the Gurmukh.<BR>
 The Infinite, All-powerful Lord is the Creator, the Cause of causes; erasing the three-phased Maya, we merge in Him.<BR>
 O Nanak, then, demerits are dissolved by merits; such are the Guru's Teachings. ||3||<BR>
 My coming and going in reincarnation have ended; doubt and hesitation are gone.<BR>
 Conquering my ego, I have met the True Lord, and now I wear the robe of Truth.<BR>
 The Guru has rid me of egotism; my sorrow and suffering are dispelled.<BR>
 My might merges into the Light; I realize and understand my own self.<BR>
 In this world of my parents' home, I am satisfied with the Shabad; at my in-laws' home, in the world beyond, I shall be pleasing to my Husband Lord.<BR>
 O Nanak, the True Guru has united me in His Union; my dependence on people has ended. ||4||3||<BR>
 Tukhaari, First Mehl:<BR>
 Deluded by doubt, misled and confused, the soul-bride later regrets and repents.<BR>
 Abandoning her Husband Lord, she sleeps, and does not appreciate His Worth.<BR>
 Leaving her Husband Lord, she sleeps, and is plundered by her faults and demerits. The night is so painful for this bride.<BR>
 Sexual desire, anger and egotism destroy her. She burns in egotism.<BR>
 When the soul-swan flies away, by the Command of the Lord, her dust mingles with dust.<BR>
 O Nanak, without the True Name, she is confused and deluded, and so she regrets and repents. ||1||<BR>
 Please listen, O my Beloved Husband Lord, to my one prayer.<BR>
 You dwell in the home of the self deep within, while I roll around like a dust-ball.<BR>
 Without my Husband Lord, no one likes me at all; what can I say or do now?<BR>
 The Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the sweetest nectar of nectars. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, with my tongue, I drink in this nectar.<BR>
 Without the Name, no one has any friend or companion; millions come and go in reincarnation.<BR>
 Nanak: the profit is earned and the soul returns home. True, true are Your Teachings. ||2||<BR>
 O Friend, You have travelled so far from Your homeland; I send my message of love to You.<BR>
 I cherish and remember that Friend; the eyes of this soul-bride are filled with tears.<BR>
 The eyes of the soul-bride are filled with tears; I dwell upon Your Glorious Virtues. How can I meet my Beloved Lord God?<BR>
 I do not know the treacherous path, the way to You. How can I find You and cross over, O my Husband Lord?<BR>
 Through the Shabad, the Word of the True Guru, the separated soul-bride meets with the Lord; I place my body and mind before You.<BR>
 O Nanak, the ambrosial tree bears the most delicious fruits; meeting with my Beloved, I taste the sweet essence. ||3||<BR>
 The Lord has called you to the Mansion of His Presence - do not delay!<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 26 - Raag Tukhaari - Part 006</H2></CENTER>
 Night and day, imbued with His Love, you shall meet with Him with intuitive ease.<BR>
 In celestial peace and poise, you shall meet Him; do not harbor anger - subdue your proud self!<BR>
 Imbued with Truth, I am united in His Union, while the self-willed manmukhs continue coming and going.<BR>
 When you dance, what veil covers you? Break the water pot, and be unattached.<BR>
 O Nanak, realize your own self; as Gurmukh, contemplate the essence of reality. ||4||4||<BR>
 Tukhaari, First Mehl:<BR>
 O my Dear Beloved, I am the slave of Your slaves.<BR>
 The Guru has shown me the Invisible Lord, and now, I do not seek any other.<BR>
 The Guru showed me the Invisible Lord, when it pleased Him, and when God showered His Blessings.<BR>
 The Life of the World, the Great Giver, the Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny, the Lord of the woods - I have met Him with intuitive ease.<BR>
 Bestow Your Glance of Grace and carry me across, to save me. Please bless me with the Truth, O Lord, Merciful to the meek.<BR>
 Prays Nanak, I am the slave of Your slaves. You are the Cherisher of all souls. ||1||<BR>
 My Dear Beloved is enshrined throughout the Universe.<BR>
 The Shabad is pervading, through the Guru, the Embodiment of the Lord.<BR>
 The Guru, the Embodiment of the Lord, is enshrined throughout the three worlds; His limits cannot be found.<BR>
 He created the beings of various colors and kinds; His Blessings increase day by day.<BR>
 The Infinite Lord Himself establishes and disestablishes; whatever pleases Him, happens.<BR>
 O Nanak, the diamond of the mind is pierced through by the diamond of spiritual wisdom. The garland of virtue is strung. ||2||<BR>
 The virtuous person merges in the Virtuous Lord; his forehead bears the insignia of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 The true person merges in the True Lord; his comings and goings are over.<BR>
 The true person realizes the True Lord, and is imbued with Truth. He meets the True Lord, and is pleasing to the Lord's Mind.<BR>
 No one else is seen to be above the True Lord; the true person merges in the True Lord.<BR>
 The Fascinating Lord has fascinated my mind; releasing me from bondage, He has set me free.<BR>
 O Nanak, my light merged into the Light, when I met my most Darling Beloved. ||3||<BR>
 By searching, the true home, the place of the True Guru is found.<BR>
 The Gurmukh obtains spiritual wisdom, while the self-willed manmukh does not.<BR>
 Whoever the Lord has blessed with the gift of Truth is accepted; the Supremely Wise Lord is forever the Great Giver.<BR>
 He is known to be Immortal, Unborn and Permanent; the True Mansion of His Presence is everlasting.<BR>
 The day-to-day account of deeds is not recorded for that person, who manifests the radiance of the Divine Light of the Lord.<BR>
 O Nanak, the true person is absorbed in the True Lord; the Gurmukh crosses over to the other side. ||4||5||<BR>
 Tukhaari, First Mehl:<BR>
 O my ignorant, unconscious mind, reform yourself.<BR>
 O my mind, leave behind your faults and demerits, and be absorbed in virtue.<BR>
 You are deluded by so many flavors and pleasures, and you act in such confusion. You are separated, and you will not meet your Lord.<BR>
 How can the impassible world-ocean be crossed? The fear of the Messenger of Death is deadly. The path of Death is agonizingly painful.<BR>
 The mortal does not know the Lord in the evening, or in the morning; trapped on the treacherous path, what will he do then?<BR>
 Bound in bondage, he is released only by this method: as Gurmukh, serve the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, abandon your household entanglements.<BR>
 O my mind, serve the Lord, the Primal, Detached Lord.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 26 - Raag Tukhaari - Part 007</H2></CENTER>
 Meditate in remembrance on the One Universal Creator; the True Lord created the entire Universe.<BR>
 The Guru controls the air, water and fire; He has staged the drama of the world.<BR>
 Reflect on your own self, and so practice good conduct; chant the Name of the Lord as your self-discipline and meditation.<BR>
 The Name of the Lord is your Companion, Friend and Dear Beloved; chant it, and meditate on it. ||2||<BR>
 O my mind, remain steady and stable, and you will not have to endure beatings.<BR>
 O my mind, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, you shall merge into Him with intuitive ease.<BR>
 Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, be happy. Apply the ointment of spiritual wisdom to your eyes.<BR>
 The Word of the Shabad is the lamp which illuminates the three worlds; it slaughters the five demons.<BR>
 Quieting your fears, become fearless, and you shall cross over the impassible world ocean. Meeting the Guru, your affairs shall be resolved.<BR>
 You shall find the joy and the beauty of the Lord's Love and Affection; the Lord Himself shall shower you with His Grace. ||3||<BR>
 O my mind, why did you come into the world? What will you take with you when you go?<BR>
 O my mind, you shall be emancipated, when you eliminate your doubts.<BR>
 So gather the wealth and capital of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, you shall realize its value.<BR>
 Filth shall be taken away, through the Immaculate Word of the Shabad; you shall know the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, your true home.<BR>
 Through the Naam, you shall obtain honor, and come home. Eagerly drink in the Ambrosial Amrit.<BR>
 Meditate on the Lord's Name, and you shall obtain the sublime essence of the Shabad; by great good fortune, chant the Praises of the Lord. ||4||<BR>
 O my mind, without a ladder, how will you climb up to the Temple of the Lord?<BR>
 O my mind, without a boat, you shall not reach the other shore.<BR>
 On that far shore is Your Beloved, Infinite Friend. Only your awareness of the Guru's Shabad will carry you across.<BR>
 Join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and you shall enjoy ecstasy; you shall not regret or repent later on.<BR>
 Be Merciful, O Merciful True Lord God: please give me the Blessing of the Lord's Name, and the Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<BR>
 Nanak prays: please hear me, O my Beloved; instruct my mind through the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||5||6||<BR>
 Tukhaari Chhant, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 My inner being is filled with love for my Beloved Husband Lord. How can I live without Him?<BR>
 As long as I do not have the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, how can I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar?<BR>
 How can I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar without the Lord? I cannot survive without Him.<BR>
 Night and day, I cry out, "Pri-o! Pri-o! Beloved! Beloved!", day and night. Without my Husband Lord, my thirst is not quenched.<BR>
 Please, bless me with Your Grace, O my Beloved Lord, that I may dwell on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, forever.<BR>
 Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I have met my Beloved; I am a sacrifice to the True Guru. ||1||<BR>
 When I see my Beloved Husband Lord, I chant the Lord's Glorious Praises with love.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 26 - Raag Tukhaari - Part 008</H2></CENTER>
 My inner being blossoms forth; I continually utter, "Pri-o! Pri-o! Beloved! Beloved!"<BR>
 I speak of my Dear Beloved, and through the Shabad, I am saved. Unless I can see Him, I am not satisfied.<BR>
 That soul-bride who is ever adorned with the Shabad, meditates on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 Please bless this beggar, Your humble servant, with the Gift of Mercy; please unite me with my Beloved.<BR>
 Night and day, I meditate on the Guru, the Lord of the World; I am a sacrifice to the True Guru. ||2||<BR>
 I am a stone in the Boat of the Guru. Please carry me across the terrifying ocean of poison.<BR>
 O Guru, please, lovingly bless me with the Word of the Shabad. I am such a fool - please save me!<BR>
 I am a fool and an idiot; I know nothing of Your extent. You are known as Inaccessible and Great.<BR>
 You Yourself are Merciful; please, mercifully bless me. I am unworthy and dishonored - please, unite me with Yourself!<BR>
 Through countless lifetimes, I wandered in sin; now, I have come seeking Your Sanctuary.<BR>
 Take pity on me and save me, Dear Lord; I have grasped the Feet of the True Guru. ||3||<BR>
 The Guru is the Philosopher's Stone; by His touch, iron is transformed into gold.<BR>
 My light merges into the Light, and my body-fortress is so beautiful.<BR>
 My body-fortress is so beautiful; I am fascinated by my God. How could I forget Him, for even a breath, or a morsel of food?<BR>
 I have seized the Unseen and Unfathomable Lord, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad. I am a sacrifice to the True Guru.<BR>
 I place my head in offering before the True Guru, if it truly pleases the True Guru.<BR>
 Take pity on me, O God, Great Giver, that Nanak may merge in Your Being. ||4||1||<BR>
 Tukhaari, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 The Lord, Har, Har, is Inaccessible, Unfathomable, Infinite, the Farthest of the Far.<BR>
 Those who meditate on You, O Lord of the Universe - those humble beings cross over the terrifying, treacherous world-ocean.<BR>
 Those who meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, easily cross over the terrifying, treacherous world-ocean.<BR>
 Those who lovingly walk in harmony with the Word of the Guru, the True Guru - the Lord, Har, Har, unites them with Himself.<BR>
 The mortal's light meets the Light of God, and blends with that Divine Light when the Lord, the Support of the Earth, grants His Grace.<BR>
 The Lord, Har, Har, is Inaccessible, Unfathomable, Infinite, the Farthest of the Far. ||1||<BR>
 O my Lord and Master, You are Inaccessible and Unfathomable. You are totally pervading and permeating each and every heart.<BR>
 You are Unseen, Unknowable and Unfathomable; You are found through the Word of the Guru, the True Guru.<BR>
 Blessed, blessed are those humble, powerful and perfect people, who join the Guru's Sangat, the Society of the Saints, and chant His Glorious Praises.<BR>
 With clear and precise understanding, the Gurmukhs contemplate the Guru's Shabad; each and every instant, they continually speak of the Lord.<BR>
 When the Gurmukh sits down, he chants the Lord's Name. When the Gurmukh stands up, he chants the Lord's Name, Har, Har.<BR>
 O my Lord and Master, You are Inaccessible and Unfathomable. You are totally pervading and permeating each and every heart. ||2||<BR>
 Those humble servants who serve are accepted. They serve the Lord, and follow the Guru's Teachings.<BR>
 All their millions of sins are taken away in an instant; the Lord takes them far away.<BR>
