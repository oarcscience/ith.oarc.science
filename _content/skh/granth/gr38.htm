<CENTER><H2>Section 38 - Phunhay, Fifth Mehl - Part 001</H2></CENTER>
 The Beloved Eternal Lord God,<BR>
 O Nanak, carries us across the world-ocean. ||14||<BR>
 It is death to forget the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 It is life to meditate on the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 The Lord is found in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,<BR>
 O Nanak, by pre-ordained destiny. ||15||<BR>
 The snake-charmer, by his spell, neutralizes the poison and leaves the snake without fangs.<BR>
 Just so, the Saints remove suffering;<BR>
 O Nanak, they are found by good karma. ||16||<BR>
 The Lord is All-pervading everywhere; He gives Sanctuary to all living beings.<BR>
 The mind is touched by His Love, O Nanak,<BR>
 by Guru's Grace, and the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. ||17||<BR>
 My mind is pierced through by the Lord's Lotus Feet.<BR>
 I am blessed with total happiness.<BR>
 Holy people have been singing this Gaat'haa, O Nanak, since the very beginning of time. ||18||<BR>
 Chanting and singing the Sublime Word of God in the Saadh Sangat, mortals are saved from the world-ocean. O Nanak, they shall never again be consigned to reincarnation. ||19||<BR>
 People contemplate the Vedas, Puraanas and Shaastras.<BR>
 But by enshrining in their hearts the Naam, the Name of the One and Only Creator of the Universe,<BR>
 everyone can be saved.<BR>
 By great good fortune, O Nanak, a few cross over like this. ||20||<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, the Name of Lord of the Universe, all one's generations are saved.<BR>
 It is obtained in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. O Nanak, by great good fortune, the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is seen. ||21||<BR>
 Abandon all your evil habits, and implant all Dharmic faith within.<BR>
 The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is obtained, O Nanak, by those who have such destiny written upon their foreheads. ||22||<BR>
 God was, is, and shall always be. He sustains and destroys all.<BR>
 Know that these Holy people are true, O Nanak; they are in love with the Lord. ||23||<BR>
 The mortal is engrossed in sweet words and transitory pleasures which shall soon fade away.<BR>
 Disease, sorrow and separation afflict him; O Nanak, he never finds peace, even in dreams. ||24||<BR>
 Phunhay, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 With Pen in Hand, the Unfathomable Lord writes the mortal's destiny upon his forehead.<BR>
 The Incomparably Beautiful Lord is involved with all.<BR>
 I cannot utter Your Praises with my mouth.<BR>
 Nanak is fascinated, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. I am a sacrifice to You. ||1||<BR>
 Seated in the Society of the Saints, I chant the Lord's Praises.<BR>
 I dedicate all my adornments to Him, and give all this soul to Him.<BR>
 With hopeful yearning for Him, I have made the bed for my Husband.<BR>
 O Lord! If such good destiny is inscribed upon my forehead, then I shall find my Friend. ||2||<BR>
 O my companion, I have prepared everything: make-up, garlands and betel-leaves.<BR>
 I have embellished myself with the sixteen decorations, and applied the mascara to my eyes.<BR>
 If my Husband Lord comes to my home, then I obtain everything.<BR>
 O Lord! Without my Husband, all these adornments are useless. ||3||<BR>
 Very fortunate is she, within whose home the Husband Lord abides.<BR>
 She is totally adorned and decorated; she is a happy soul-bride.<BR>
 I sleep in peace, without anxiety; the hopes of my mind have been fulfilled.<BR>
 O Lord! When my Husband came into the home of my heart, I obtained everything. ||4||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 38 - Phunhay, Fifth Mehl - Part 002</H2></CENTER>
 My hope is so intense, that this hope alone should fulfill my hopes.<BR>
 When the True Guru becomes merciful, then I attain the Perfect Lord.<BR>
 My body is filled with so many demerits; I am covered with faults and demerits.<BR>
 O Lord! When the True Guru becomes Merciful, then the mind is held in place. ||5||<BR>
 Says Nanak, I have meditated on the Lord, Infinite and Endless.<BR>
 This world-ocean is so difficult to cross; the True Guru has carried me across.<BR>
 My comings and goings in reincarnation ended, when I met the Perfect Lord.<BR>
 O Lord! I have obtained the Ambrosial Nectar of the Name of the Lord from the True Guru. ||6||<BR>
 The lotus is in my hand; in the courtyard of my heart I abide in peace.<BR>
 O my companion, the Jewel is around my neck; beholding it, sorrow is taken away.<BR>
 I abide with the Lord of the World, the Treasury of Total Peace. O Lord!<BR>
 All wealth, spiritual perfection and the nine treasures are in His Hand. ||7||<BR>
 Those men who go out to enjoy other men's women shall suffer in shame.<BR>
 Those who steal the wealth of others - how can their guilt be concealed?<BR>
 Those who chant the Sacred Praises of the Lord save and redeem all their generations.<BR>
 O Lord! Those who listen and contemplate the Supreme Lord God become pure and holy. ||8||<BR>
 The sky above looks lovely, and the earth below is beautiful.<BR>
 Lightning flashes in the ten directions; I behold the Face of my Beloved.<BR>
 If I go searching in foreign lands, how can I find my Beloved?<BR>
 O Lord! If such destiny is inscribed upon my forehead, I am absorbed in the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. ||9||<BR>
 I have seen all places, but none can compare to You.<BR>
 The Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny, has established You; thus You are adorned and embellished.<BR>
 Ramdaspur is prosperous and thickly populated, and incomparably beautiful.<BR>
 O Lord! Bathing in the Sacred Pool of Raam Daas, the sins are washed away, O Nanak. ||10||<BR>
 The rainbird is very smart; in its consciousness, it longs for the friendly rain.<BR>
 It longs for that, to which its breath of life is attached.<BR>
 It wanders depressed, from forest to forest, for the sake of a drop of water.<BR>
 O Lord! In just the same way, the humble servant of the Lord begs for the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Nanak is a sacrifice to him. ||11||<BR>
 The Consciousness of my Friend is incomparably beautiful. Its mystery cannot be known.<BR>
 One who purchases the priceless virtues realizes the essence of reality.<BR>
 When the consciousness is absorbed in the supreme consciousness, great joy and bliss are found.<BR>
 O Lord! When the fickle thieves are overcome, the true wealth is obtained. ||12||<BR>
 In a dream, I was lifted up; why didn't I grasp the hem of His Robe?<BR>
 Gazing upon the Beautiful Lord relaxing there, my mind was charmed and fascinated.<BR>
 I am searching for His Feet - tell me, where can I find Him?<BR>
 O Lord! Tell me how I can find my Beloved, O my companion. ||13||<BR>
 The eyes which do not see the Holy - those eyes are miserable.<BR>
 The ears which do not hear the Sound-current of the Naad - those ears might just as well be plugged.<BR>
 The tongue which does not chant the Naam ought to be cut out, bit by bit.<BR>
 O Lord! When the mortal forgets the Lord of the Universe, the Sovereign Lord King, he grows weaker day by day. ||14||<BR>
 The wings of the bumble bee are caught in the intoxicating fragrant petals of the lotus.<BR>
 With its limbs entangled in the petals, it loses its senses.<BR>
