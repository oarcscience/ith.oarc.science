 So Dar ~ That Door. Raag Aasaa, First Mehl:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Where is That Door of Yours, and where is That Home, in which You sit and take care of all?<BR>
 The Sound-current of the Naad vibrates there for You, and countless musicians play all sorts of instruments there for You.<BR>
 There are so many Ragas and musical harmonies to You; so many minstrels sing hymns of You.<BR>
 Wind, water and fire sing of You. The Righteous Judge of Dharma sings at Your Door.<BR>
 Chitr and Gupt, the angels of the conscious and the subconscious who keep the record of actions, and the Righteous Judge of Dharma who reads this record, sing of You.<BR>
 Shiva, Brahma and the Goddess of Beauty, ever adorned by You, sing of You.<BR>
 Indra, seated on His Throne, sings of You, with the deities at Your Door.<BR>
 The Siddhas in Samaadhi sing of You; the Saadhus sing of You in contemplation.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 02 - So Dar - Part 002</H2></CENTER>
 The celibates, the fanatics, and the peacefully accepting sing of You; the fearless warriors sing of You.<BR>
 The Pandits, the religious scholars who recite the Vedas, with the supreme sages of all the ages, sing of You.<BR>
 The Mohinis, the enchanting heavenly beauties who entice hearts in paradise, in this world, and in the underworld of the subconscious, sing of You.<BR>
 The celestial jewels created by You, and the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, sing of You.<BR>
 The brave and mighty warriors sing of You. The spiritual heroes and the four sources of creation sing of You.<BR>
 The worlds, solar systems and galaxies, created and arranged by Your Hand, sing of You.<BR>
 They alone sing of You, who are pleasing to Your Will. Your devotees are imbued with Your Sublime Essence.<BR>
 So many others sing of You, they do not come to mind. O Nanak, how can I think of them all?<BR>
 That True Lord is True, forever True, and True is His Name.<BR>
 He is, and shall always be. He shall not depart, even when this Universe which He has created departs.<BR>
 He created the world, with its various colors, species of beings, and the variety of Maya.<BR>
 Having created the creation, He watches over it Himself, by His Greatness.<BR>
 He does whatever He pleases. No one can issue any order to Him.<BR>
 He is the King, the King of kings, the Supreme Lord and Master of kings. Nanak remains subject to His Will. ||1||<BR>
 Aasaa, First Mehl:<BR>
 Hearing of His Greatness, everyone calls Him Great.<BR>
 But just how Great His Greatness is-this is known only to those who have seen Him.<BR>
 His Value cannot be estimated; He cannot be described.<BR>
 Those who describe You, Lord, remain immersed and absorbed in You. ||1||<BR>
 O my Great Lord and Master of Unfathomable Depth, You are the Ocean of Excellence.<BR>
 No one knows the extent or the vastness of Your Expanse. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 All the intuitives met and practiced intuitive meditation.<BR>
 All the appraisers met and made the appraisal.<BR>
 The spiritual teachers, the teachers of meditation, and the teachers of teachers<BR>
 -they cannot describe even an iota of Your Greatness. ||2||<BR>
 All Truth, all austere discipline, all goodness,<BR>
 all the great miraculous spiritual powers of the Siddhas<BR>
 -without You, no one has attained such powers.<BR>
 They are received only by Your Grace. No one can block them or stop their flow. ||3||<BR>
 What can the poor helpless creatures do?<BR>
 Your Praises are overflowing with Your Treasures.<BR>
 Those, unto whom You give-how can they think of any other?<BR>
 O Nanak, the True One embellishes and exalts. ||4||2||<BR>
 Aasaa, First Mehl:<BR>
 Chanting it, I live; forgetting it, I die.<BR>
 It is so difficult to chant the True Name.<BR>
 If someone feels hunger for the True Name,<BR>
 that hunger shall consume his pain. ||1||<BR>
 How can I forget Him, O my mother?<BR>
 True is the Master, True is His Name. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Trying to describe even an iota of the Greatness of the True Name,<BR>
 people have grown weary, but they have not been able to evaluate it.<BR>
 Even if everyone were to gather together and speak of Him,<BR>
 He would not become any greater or any lesser. ||2||<BR>
 That Lord does not die; there is no reason to mourn.<BR>
 He continues to give, and His Provisions never run short.<BR>
 This Virtue is His alone; there is no other like Him.<BR>
 There never has been, and there never will be. ||3||<BR>
 As Great as You Yourself are, O Lord, so Great are Your Gifts.<BR>
