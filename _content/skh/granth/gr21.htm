 One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:<BR>
 Raag Gond, Chau-Padas, Fourth Mehl, First House:<BR>
 If, in his conscious mind, he places his hopes in the Lord, then he shall obtain the fruits of all the many desires of his mind.<BR>
 The Lord knows everything which happens to the soul. Not even an iota of one's effort goes to waste.<BR>
 Place your hopes in the Lord, O my mind; the Lord and Master is pervading and permeating all. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, place your hopes in the Lord of the World, the Master of the Universe.<BR>
 That hope which is placed in any other than the Lord - that hope is fruitless, and totally useless. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 That which you can see, Maya, and all attachment to family - don't place your hopes in them, or your life will be wasted and lost.<BR>
 Nothing is in their hands; what can these poor creatures do? By their actions, nothing can be done.<BR>
 O my mind, place your hopes in the Lord, your Beloved, who shall carry you across, and save your whole family as well. ||2||<BR>
 If you place your hopes in any other, in any friend other than the Lord, then you shall come to know that it is of no use at all.<BR>
 This hope placed in other friends comes from the love of duality. In an instant, it is gone; it is totally false.<BR>
 O my mind, place your hopes in the Lord, your True Beloved, who shall approve and reward you for all your efforts. ||3||<BR>
 Hope and desire are all Yours, O my Lord and Master. As You inspire hope, so are the hopes held.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 21 - Raag Gond - Part 002</H2></CENTER>
 Nothing is in the hands of anyone, O my Lord and Master; such is the understanding the True Guru has given me to understand.<BR>
 You alone know the hope of servant Nanak, O Lord; gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, he is satisfied. ||4||1||<BR>
 Gond, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 Serve such a Lord, and ever meditate on Him, who in an instant erases all sins and mistakes.<BR>
 If someone forsakes the Lord and places his hopes in another, then all his service to the Lord is rendered fruitless.<BR>
 O my mind, serve the Lord, the Giver of peace; serving Him, all your hunger shall depart. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, place your faith in the Lord.<BR>
 Wherever I go, my Lord and Master is there with me. The Lord saves the honor of His humble servants and slaves. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 If you tell your sorrows to another, then he, in return, will tell you of his greater sorrows.<BR>
 So tell your sorrows to the Lord, your Lord and Master, who shall instantly dispel your pain.<BR>
 Forsaking such a Lord God, if you tell your sorrows to another, then you shall die of shame. ||2||<BR>
 The relatives, friends and siblings of the world that you see, O my mind, all meet with you for their own purposes.<BR>
 And that day, when their self-interests are not served, on that day, they shall not come near you.<BR>
 O my mind, serve your Lord, day and night; He shall help you in good times and bad. ||3||<BR>
 Why place your faith in anyone, O my mind, who cannot come to your rescue at the last instant?<BR>
 Chant the Lord's Mantra, take the Guru's Teachings, and meditate on Him. In the end, the Lord saves those who love Him in their consciousness.<BR>
 Servant Nanak speaks: night and day, chant the Lord's Name, O Saints; this is the only true hope for emancipation. ||4||2||<BR>
 Gond, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 Remembering the Lord in meditation, you shall find bliss and peace forever deep within, and your mind will become tranquil and cool.<BR>
 It is like the harsh sun of Maya, with its burning heat; seeing the moon, the Guru, its heat totally vanishes. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, night and day, meditate, and chant the Lord's Name.<BR>
 Here and hereafter, He shall protect you, everywhere; serve such a God forever. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Meditate on the Lord, who contains all treasures, O my mind; as Gurmukh, search for the jewel, the Lord.<BR>
 Those who meditate on the Lord, find the Lord, my Lord and Master; I wash the feet of those slaves of the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 One who realizes the Word of the Shabad, obtains the sublime essence of the Lord; such a Saint is lofty and sublime, the greatest of the great.<BR>
 The Lord Himself magnifies the glory of that humble servant. No one can lessen or decrease that glory, not even a bit. ||3||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 21 - Raag Gond - Part 003</H2></CENTER>
 He shall give you peace, O my mind; meditate forever, every day on Him, with your palms pressed together.<BR>
 Please bless servant Nanak with this one gift, O Lord, that Your feet may dwell within my heart forever. ||4||3||<BR>
 Gond, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 All the kings, emperors, nobles, lords and chiefs are false and transitory, engrossed in duality - know this well.<BR>
 The eternal Lord is permanent and unchanging; meditate on Him, O my mind, and you shall be approved. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, vibrate, and meditate on the Lord's Name, which shall be your defender forever.<BR>
 One who obtains the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, through the Word of the Guru's Teachings - no one else's power is as great as his. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 All the wealthy, high class property owners which you see, O my mind, shall vanish, like the fading color of the safflower.<BR>
 Serve the True, Immaculate Lord forever, O my mind, and you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord. ||2||<BR>
 There are four castes: Brahmin, Kh'shaatriya, Soodra and Vaishya, and there are four stages of life. One who meditates on the Lord, is the most distinguished and renowned.<BR>
 The poor castor oil plant, growing near the sandalwood tree, becomes fragrant; in the same way, the sinner, associating with the Saints, becomes acceptable and approved. ||3||<BR>
 He, within whose heart the Lord abides, is the highest of all, and the purest of all.<BR>
 Servant Nanak washes the feet of thM at humble servant of the Lord; he may be from a low class family, but he is now the Lord's servant. ||4||4||<BR>
 Gond, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 The Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, is all-pervading. As the Lord causes them to act, so do they act.<BR>
 So serve forever such a Lord, O my mind, who will protect you from everything. ||1||<BR>
 O my mind, meditate on the Lord, and read about the Lord every day.<BR>
 Other than the Lord, no one can kill you or save you; so why do you worry, O my mind? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Creator created the entire universe, and infused His Light into it.<BR>
 The One Lord speaks, and the One Lord causes all to speak.The Perfect Guru has revealed the One Lord. ||2||<BR>
 The Lord is with you, inside and out; tell me, O mind, how can You hide anything from Him?<BR>
 Serve the Lord open-heartedly, and then, O my mind, you shall find total peace. ||3||<BR>
 Everything is under His control; He is the greatest of all. O my mind, meditate forever on Him.<BR>
 O Servant Nanak, that Lord is always with you. Meditate forever on your Lord, and He shall emancipate you. ||4||5||<BR>
 Gond, Fourth Mehl:<BR>
 My mind yearns so deeply for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, like the thirsty man without water. ||1||<BR>
 My mind is pierced through by the arrow of the Lord's Love.<BR>
 The Lord God knows my anguish, and the pain deep within my mind. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Whoever tells me the Stories of my Beloved Lord is my Sibling of Destiny, and my friend. ||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 21 - Raag Gond - Part 004</H2></CENTER>
 Come, and join together, O my companions; let's sing the Glorious Praises of my God, and follow the comforting advice of the True Guru.. ||3||<BR>
 Please fulfill the hopes of servant Nanak, O Lord; his body finds peace and tranquility in the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||4||6||<BR>
 First set of six. ||<BR>
 Raag Gond, Fifth Mehl, Chau-Padas, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 He is the Creator of all, He is the Enjoyer of all. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Creator listens, and the Creator sees.<BR>
 The Creator is unseen, and the Creator is seen.<BR>
 The Creator forms, and the Creator destroys.<BR>
 The Creator touches, and the Creator is detached. ||1||<BR>
 The Creator is the One who speaks, and the Creator is the One who understands.<BR>
 The Creator comes, and the Creator also goes.<BR>
 The Creator is absolute and without qualities; the Creator is related, with the most excellent qualities.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, Nanak looks upon all the same. ||2||1||<BR>
 Gond, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 You are caught, like the fish and the monkey; you are entangled in the transitory world.<BR>
 Your foot-steps and your breaths are numbered; only by singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord will you be saved. ||1||<BR>
 O mind, reform yourself, and forsake your aimless wandering.<BR>
 You have found no place of rest for yourself; so why do you try to teach others? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Like the elephant, driven by sexual desire, you are attached to your family.<BR>
 People are like birds that come together, and fly apart again; you shall become stable and steady, only when you meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, in the Company of the Holy. ||2||<BR>
 Like the fish, which perishes because of its desire to taste, the fool is ruined by his greed.<BR>
 You have fallen under the power of the five thieves; escape is only possible in the Sanctuary of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 Be Merciful to me, O Destroyer of the pains of the meek; all beings and creatures belong to You.<BR>
 May I obtain the gift of always seeing the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; meeting with You, Nanak is the slave of Your slaves. ||4||2||<BR>
 Raag Gond, Fifth Mehl, Chau-Padas, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 He fashioned the soul and the breath of life,<BR>
 and infused His Light into the dust;<BR>

 - how can you forsake that God, you fool! Where else will you go? ||1||<BR>
 Commit yourself to the service of the Transcendent Lord.<BR>
 Through the Guru, one understands the Immaculate, Divine Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He created plays and dramas of all sorts;<BR>
 He creates and destroys in an instant;<BR>
 His state and condition cannot be described.<BR>
 Meditate forever on that God, O my mind. ||2||<BR>
 The unchanging Lord does not come or go.<BR>
 His Glorious Virtues are infinite; how many of them can I count?<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 21 - Raag Gond - Part 005</H2></CENTER>
 His treasure is overflowing with the rubies of the Name.<BR>
 He gives Support to all hearts. ||3||<BR>
 The Name is the True Primal Being;<BR>
 millions of sins are washed away in an instant, singing His Praises.<BR>
 The Lord God is your best friend, your playmate from earliest childhood.<BR>
 He is the Support of the breath of life; O Nanak, He is love, He is consciousness. ||4||1||3||<BR>
 Gond, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I trade in the Naam, the Name of the Lord.<BR>
 The Naam is the Support of the mind.<BR>
 My consciousness takes to the Shelter of the Naam.<BR>
 Chanting the Naam, millions of sins are erased. ||1||<BR>
 The Lord has blessed me with the wealth of the Naam, the Name of the One Lord.<BR>
 The wish of my mind is to meditate on the Naam, in association with the Guru. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Naam is the wealth of my soul.<BR>
 Wherever I go, the Naam is with me.<BR>
 The Naam is sweet to my mind.<BR>
 In the water, on the land, and everywhere, I see the Naam. ||2||<BR>
 Through the Naam, one's face becomes radiant in the Court of the Lord.<BR>
 Through the Naam, all one's generations are saved.<BR>
 Through the Naam, my affairs are resolved.<BR>
 My mind is accustomed to the Naam. ||3||<BR>
 Through the Naam, I have become fearless.<BR>
 Through the Naam, my comings and goings have ceased.<BR>
 The Perfect Guru has united me with the Lord, the treasure of virtue.<BR>
 Says Nanak, I dwell in celestial peace. ||4||2||4||<BR>
 Gond, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 He grants honor to the dishonored,<BR>
 and gives gifts to all the hungry;<BR>
 he protects those in the terrible womb.<BR>
 So humbly bow forever to that Lord and Master. ||1||<BR>
 Meditate on such a God in your mind.<BR>
 He shall be your help and support everywhere, in good times and bad. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The beggar and the king are all the same to Him.<BR>
 He sustains and fulfills both the ant and the elephant.<BR>
 He does not consult or seek anyone's advice.<BR>
 Whatever He does, He does Himself. ||2||<BR>
 No one knows His limit.<BR>
 He Himself is the Immaculate Lord.<BR>
 He Himself is formed, and He Himself is formless.<BR>
 In the heart, in each and every heart, He is the Support of all hearts. ||3||<BR>
 Through the Love of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the devotees become His Beloveds.<BR>
 Singing the Praises of the Creator, the Saints are forever in bliss.<BR>
 Through the Love of the Naam, the Lord's humble servants remain satisfied.<BR>
 Nanak falls at the feet of those humble servants of the Lord. ||4||3||5||<BR>

 Associating with them, one meditates in remembrance on the Lord, Har, Har.<BR>
 Associating with them, all the sins are erased.<BR>
 Associating with them, the heart is illumined. ||1||<BR>
 Those Saints of the Lord are my friends.<BR>
 It is their custom to sing only the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 By their mantra, the Lord, Har, Har, dwells in the mind.<BR>
 By their teachings, doubt and fear are dispelled.<BR>
 By their kirtan, they become immaculate and sublime.<BR>
 The world longs for the dust of their feet. ||2||<BR>
 Millions of sinners are saved by associating with them.<BR>
 They have the Support of the Name of the One Formless Lord.<BR>
 He knows the secrets of all beings;<BR>
 He is the treasure of mercy, the divine immaculate Lord. ||3||<BR>
 When the Supreme Lord God becomes merciful,<BR>
 then one meets the Merciful Holy Guru.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 21 - Raag Gond - Part 006</H2></CENTER>

 One whose mind is attached to the Guru's feet<BR>
 - his pains, sufferings and doubts run away.<BR>
 Serving the Guru, honor is obtained.<BR>
 I am forever a sacrifice to the Guru. ||2||<BR>
 Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan, I am exalted.<BR>
 The work of the Guru's servant is perfect.<BR>
 Pain does not afflict the Guru's servant.<BR>
 The Guru's servant is famous in the ten directions. ||3||<BR>
 The Guru's glory cannot be described.<BR>
 The Guru remains absorbed in the Supreme Lord God.<BR>
 Says Nanak, one who is blessed with perfect destiny<BR>
 - his mind is attached to the Guru's feet. ||4||6||8||<BR>

 Gond, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Deal and trade only with the Lord, Raam, Raam.<BR>

 Gond, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 My Lord and Master has held back the five demons.<BR>
 He conquered them, and scared them away from the Lord's slave.<BR>
 They cannot find the mansion of the Lord's devotee.<BR>
 Joining together, the Lord's humble servants sing the songs of joy. ||1||<BR>
 The five demons are the rulers of the whole world,<BR>
 but they are just water-carriers for the Lord's devotee. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 They collect taxes from the world,<BR>
 but they bow in subservience to God's devotees.<BR>
 They plunder and dishonor the faithless cynics,<BR>
 but they massage and wash the feet of the Holy. ||2||<BR>
 The One Mother gave birth to the five sons,<BR>
 and began the play of the created world.<BR>
 With the three qualities joined together, they celebrate.<BR>
 Renouncing these three qualities, the Lord's humble servants rise above them. ||3||<BR>
 In His Mercy, He saves His humble servants.<BR>
 They belong to Him, and so He saves them by driving out the five.<BR>
 Says Nanak, devotion to God is noble and sublime.<BR>
 Without devotion, all just waste away uselessly. ||4||9||11||<BR>

 Suffering and troubles are eradicated by the Lord's Name.<BR>
 Pain is dispelled, and peace takes its place.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>Section 21 - Raag Gond - Part 008</H2></CENTER>
 Bow in humility to the lotus feet of the Guru.<BR>
 Eliminate sexual desire and anger from this body.<BR>
 Be the dust of all,<BR>
 and see the Lord in each and every heart, in all. ||1||<BR>
 In this way, dwell upon the Lord of the World, the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 My body and wealth belong to God; my soul belongs to God. ||1||Pause||<BR>

 and in the world hereafter you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord.<BR>
 Your mind and body will be immaculate and blissful;<BR>
 chant the Name of the Lord of the Universe with your tongue. ||3||<BR>
 Grant Your Kind Mercy, O my Lord, Merciful to the meek.<BR>
 My mind begs for the dust of the feet of the Holy.<BR>
 Be merciful, and bless me with this gift,<BR>
 that Nanak may live, chanting God's Name. ||4||11||13||<BR>
 Gond, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 My incense and lamps are my service to the Lord.<BR>
 Time and time again, I humbly bow to the Creator.<BR>
 I have renounced everything, and grasped the Sanctuary of God.<BR>
 By great good fortune, the Guru has become pleased and satisfied with me. ||1||<BR>
 Twenty-four hours a day, I sing of the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 My body and wealth belong to God; my soul belongs to God. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Chanting the Glorious Praises of the Lord, I am in bliss.<BR>
 The Supreme Lord God is the Perfect Forgiver.<BR>
 Granting His Mercy, He has linked His humble servants to His service.<BR>
 He has rid me of the pains of birth and death, and merged me with Himself. ||2||<BR>
 This is the essence of karma, righteous conduct and spiritual wisdom,<BR>
 to chant the Lord's Name in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<BR>
 God's Feet are the boat to cross over the world-ocean.<BR>
 God, the Inner-knower, is the Cause of causes. ||3||<BR>

 The Divine Guru has saved His child.<BR>
 God is kind and compassionate; He is the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 He forgives all beings and creatures. ||1||<BR>
 I seek Your Sanctuary, O God, O Merciful to the meek.<BR>
 Meditating on the Supreme Lord God, I am forever in ecstasy. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 There is no other like the Merciful Lord God.<BR>
 He is contained deep within each and every heart.<BR>
 He embellishes His slave, here and hereafter.<BR>
 It is Your nature, God, to purify sinners. ||2||<BR>
 Meditation on the Lord of the Universe is the medicine to cure millions of illnesses.<BR>
 My Tantra and Mantra is to meditate, to vibrate upon the Lord God.<BR>
 Illnesses and pains are dispelled, meditating on God.<BR>
 The fruits of the mind's desires are fulfilled. ||3||<BR>
 He is the Cause of causes, the All-powerful Merciful Lord.<BR>
 Contemplating Him is the greatest of all treasures.<BR>
 God Himself has forgiven Nanak;<BR>
 forever and ever, he chants the Name of the One Lord. ||4||13||15||<BR>
 Gond, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my friend.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 21 - Raag Gond - Part 009</H2></CENTER>
 Your consciousness shall become immaculate and pure.<BR>
 All the misfortunes of your mind and body shall be taken away,<BR>
 and all your pain and darkness will be dispelled. ||1||<BR>
 Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, cross over the world-ocean.<BR>
 By great good fortune, one attains the Infinite Lord, the Primal Being. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Messenger of Death cannot even touch that humble being, who sings the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.<BR>
 The Gurmukh realizes his Lord and Master; his coming into this world is approved. ||2||<BR>
 He sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, by the Grace of the Saints;<BR>
 his sexual desire, anger and madness are eradicated.<BR>
 He knows the Lord God to be ever-present.<BR>
 This is the Perfect Teaching of the Perfect Guru. ||3||<BR>
 He earns the treasure of the Lord's wealth.<BR>
 Meeting with the True Guru, all his affairs are resolved.<BR>
 He is awake and aware in the Love of the Lord's Name;<BR>
 O Nanak, his mind is attached to the Lord's Feet. ||4||14||16||<BR>
 Gond, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The Lord's Feet are the boat to cross over the terrifying world-ocean.<BR>
 Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he does not die again.<BR>
 Chanting the Glorious Praises of the Lord, he does not have to walk on the Path of Death.<BR>
 Contemplating the Supreme Lord, the five demons are conquered. ||1||<BR>
 I have entered Your Sanctuary, O Perfect Lord and Master.<BR>
 Please give Your hand to Your creatures. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Simritees, Shaastras, Vedas and Puraanas<BR>
 expound upon the Supreme Lord God.<BR>
 The Yogis, celibates, Vaishnavs and followers of Ram Das<BR>
 cannot find the limits of the Eternal Lord God. ||2||<BR>
 Shiva and the gods lament and moan,<BR>
 but they do not understand even a tiny bit of the unseen and unknown Lord.<BR>
 One whom the Lord Himself blesses with loving devotional worship,<BR>
 is very rare in this world. ||3||<BR>
 I am worthless, with absolutely no virtue at all;<BR>
 all treasures are in Your Glance of Grace.<BR>
 Nanak, the meek, desires only to serve You.<BR>
 Please be merciful, and grant him this blessing, O Divine Guru. ||4||15||17||<BR>
 Gond, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One who is cursed by the Saints, is thrown down on the ground.<BR>
 The slanderer of the Saints is thrown down from the skies.<BR>
 I hold the Saints close to my soul.<BR>
 The Saints are saved instantaneously. ||1||<BR>
 He alone is a Saint, who is pleasing to the Lord.<BR>
 The Saints, and God, have only one job to do. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 God gives His hand to shelter the Saints.<BR>
 He dwells with His Saints, day and night.<BR>
 With each and every breath, He cherishes His Saints.<BR>
 He takes the power away from the enemies of the Saints. ||2||<BR>
 Let no one slander the Saints.<BR>
 Whoever slanders them, will be destroyed.<BR>
 One who is protected by the Creator Lord,<BR>
 cannot be harmed, no matter how much the whole world may try. ||3||<BR>
 I place my faith in my God.<BR>
 My soul and body all belong to Him.<BR>
 This is the faith which inspires Nanak:<BR>
 the self-willed manmukhs will fail, while the Gurmukhs will always win. ||4||16||18||<BR>
 Gond, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 The Name of the Immaculate Lord is the Ambrosial Water.<BR>
 Chanting it with the tongue, sins are washed away. ||1||Pause||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 21 - Raag Gond - Part 010</H2></CENTER>
 The Lord abides in everyone.<BR>
 The Lord illumines each and every heart.<BR>
 Chanting the Lord's Name, one does not fall into hell.<BR>
 Serving the Lord, all fruitful rewards are obtained. ||1||<BR>
 Within my mind is the Support of the Lord.<BR>
 The Lord is the boat to cross over the world-ocean.<BR>
 Chant the Lord's Name, and the Messenger of Death will run away.<BR>
 The Lord breaks the teeth of Maya, the witch. ||2||<BR>
 The Lord is forever and ever the Forgiver.<BR>
 The Lord blesses us with peace and bliss.<BR>
 The Lord has revealed His glory.<BR>
 The Lord is the mother and father of His Saint. ||3||<BR>
 The Lord, the Lord, is in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.<BR>
 Time and time again, I sing the Lord's Praises.<BR>
 Meeting with the Guru, I have attained the incomprehensible object.<BR>
 Slave Nanak has grasped the Support of the Lord. ||4||17||19||<BR>
 Gond, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 One who is protected by the Protector Lord<BR>
 - the Formless Lord is on his side. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 In the mother's womb, the fire does not touch him.<BR>
 Sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment do not affect him.<BR>
 In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, he meditates on the Formless Lord.<BR>
 Dust is thrown into the faces of the slanderers. ||1||<BR>
 The Lord's protective spell is the armor of His slave.<BR>
 The wicked, evil demons cannot even touch him.<BR>
 Whoever indulges in egotistical pride, shall waste away to ruin.<BR>
 God is the Sanctuary of His humble slave. ||2||<BR>
 Whoever enters the Sanctuary of the Sovereign Lord<BR>
 - He saves that slave, hugging him close in His embrace.<BR>
 Whoever takes great pride in himself,<BR>
 in an instant, shall be like dust mixing with dust. ||3||<BR>
 The True Lord is, and shall always be.<BR>
 Forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to Him.<BR>
 Granting His Mercy, He saves His slaves.<BR>
 God is the Support of Nanak's breath of life. ||4||18||20||<BR>
 Gond, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 Wondrous and beautiful is the description of the beauty of the Supreme Soul, the Supreme Lord God. ||Pause||<BR>
 He is not old; He is not young.<BR>
 He is not in pain; He is not caught in Death's noose.<BR>
 He does not die; He does not go away.<BR>
 In the beginning, and throughout the ages, He is permeating everywhere. ||1||<BR>
 He is not hot; He is not cold.<BR>
 He has no enemy; He has no friend.<BR>
 He is not happy; He is not sad.<BR>
 Everything belongs to Him; He can do anything. ||2||<BR>
 He has no father; He has no mother.<BR>
 He is beyond the beyond, and has always been so.<BR>
 He is not affected by virtue or vice.<BR>
 Deep within each and every heart, He is always awake and aware. ||3||<BR>
 From the three qualities, the one mechanism of Maya was produced.<BR>
 The great Maya is only His shadow.<BR>
 He is undeceivable, impenetrable, unfathomable and merciful.<BR>
 He is merciful to the meek, forever compassionate.<BR>
 His state and limits cannot ever be known.<BR>
 Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to Him. ||4||19||21||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 21 - Raag Gond - Part 011</H2></CENTER>
 Gond, Fifth Mehl:<BR>
 I am a sacrifice to the Saints.<BR>
 Associating with the Saints, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.<BR>
 By the Grace of the Saints, all the sins are taken away.<BR>
 By great good fortune, one finds the Sanctuary of the Saints. ||1||<BR>
 Meditating on the Lord, no obstacles will block your way.<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, meditate on God. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 When the Supreme Lord God becomes merciful,<BR>
 he makes me the dust of the feet of the Holy.<BR>
 Sexual desire and anger leave his body,<BR>
 and the Lord, the jewel, comes to dwell in his mind. ||2||<BR>
 Fruitful and approved is the life of one<BR>
 who knows the Supreme Lord God to be close.<BR>
 One who is committed to loving devotional worship of God, and the Kirtan of His Praises,<BR>
 awakens from the sleep of countless incarnations. ||3||<BR>
 The Lord's Lotus Feet are the Support of His humble servant.<BR>
 To chant the Praises of the Lord of the Universe is the true trade.<BR>
 Please fulfill the hopes of Your humble slave.<BR>
 Nanak finds peace in the dust of the feet of the humble. ||4||20||22||6||28||<BR>
 Raag Gond, Ashtapadees, Fifth Mehl, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Humbly bow to the Perfect Divine Guru.<BR>
 Fruitful is His image, and fruitful is service to Him.<BR>
 He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, the Architect of Destiny.<BR>
 Twenty-four hours a day, he remains imbued with the love of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||<BR>
 The Guru is the Lord of the Universe, the Guru is the Lord of the World.<BR>
 He is the Saving Grace of His slaves. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He satisfies the kings, emperors and nobles.<BR>
 He destroys the egotistical villains.<BR>
 He puts illness into the mouths of the slanderers.<BR>
 All the people celebrate His victory. ||2||<BR>
 Supreme bliss fills the minds of the Saints.<BR>
 The Saints meditate on the Divine Guru, the Lord God.<BR>
 The faces of His companions become radiant and bright.<BR>
 The slanderers lose all places of rest. ||3||<BR>
 With each and every breath, the Lord's humble slaves praise Him.<BR>
 The Supreme Lord God and the Guru are care-free.<BR>
 All fears are eradicated, in His Sanctuary.<BR>
 Smashing all the slanderers, the Lord knocks them to the ground. ||4||<BR>
 Let no one slander the Lord's humble servants.<BR>
 Whoever does so, will be miserable.<BR>
 Twenty-four hours a day, the Lord's humble servant meditates on Him alone.<BR>
 The Messenger of Death does not even approach him. ||5||<BR>
 The Lord's humble servant has no vengeance. The slanderer is egotistical.<BR>
 The Lord's humble servant wishes well, while the slanderer dwells on evil.<BR>
 The Sikh of the Guru meditates on the True Guru.<BR>
 The Lord's humble servants are saved, while the slanderer is cast into hell. ||6||<BR>
 Listen, O my beloved friends and companions:<BR>
 these words shall be true in the Court of the Lord.<BR>
 As you plant, so shall you harvest.<BR>
 The proud, egotistical person will surely be uprooted. ||7||<BR>
 O True Guru, You are the Support of the unsupported.<BR>
 Be merciful, and save Your humble servant.<BR>
 Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to the Guru;<BR>

 Raag Gond, The Word Of The Devotees.<BR>
 Kabeer Jee, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 When you meet a Saint, talk to him and listen.<BR>
 Meeting with an unsaintly person, just remain silent. ||1||<BR>
 O father, if I speak, what words should I utter?<BR>
 Speak such words, by which you may remain absorbed in the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Speaking with the Saints, one becomes generous.<BR>
 To speak with a fool is to babble uselessly. ||2||<BR>
 By speaking and only speaking, corruption only increases.<BR>
 If I do not speak, what can the poor wretch do? ||3||<BR>
 Says Kabeer, the empty pitcher makes noise,<BR>
 but that which is full makes no sound. ||4||1||<BR>
 GOND:<BR>
 When a man dies, he is of no use to anyone.<BR>
 But when an animal dies, it is used in ten ways. ||1||<BR>
 What do I know, about the state of my karma?<BR>
 What do I know, O Baba? ||1||Pause||<BR>
 His bones burn, like a bundle of logs;<BR>
 his hair burns like a bale of hay. ||2||<BR>
 Says Kabeer, the man wakes up,<BR>
 only when the Messenger of Death hits him over the head with his club. ||3||2||<BR>
 GOND:<BR>
 The Celestial Lord is in the Akaashic ethers of the skies, the Celestial Lord is in the nether regions of the underworld; in the four directions, the Celestial Lord is pervading.<BR>
 The Supreme Lord God is forever the source of bliss. When the vessel of the body perishes, the Celestial Lord does not perish. ||1||<BR>
 I have become sad,<BR>
 wondering where the soul comes from, and where it goes. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The body is formed from the union of the five tatvas; but where were the five tatvas created?<BR>
 You say that the soul is tied to its karma, but who gave karma to the body? ||2||<BR>
 The body is contained in the Lord, and the Lord is contained in the body. He is permeating within all.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, I shall not renounce the Lord's Name. I shall accept whatever happens. ||3||3||<BR>
 Raag Gond, The Word Of Kabeer Jee, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 They tied my arms, bundled me up, and threw me before an elephant.<BR>
 The elephant driver struck him on the head, and infuriated him.<BR>
 But the elephant ran away, trumpeting,<BR>
 "I am a sacrifice to this image of the Lord."||1||<BR>
 O my Lord and Master, You are my strength.<BR>
 The Qazi shouted at the driver to drive the elephant on. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He yelled out, "O driver, I shall cut you into pieces.<BR>
 Hit him, and drive him on!"<BR>
 But the elephant did not move; instead, he began to meditate.<BR>
 The Lord God abides within his mind. ||2||<BR>
 What sin has this Saint committed,<BR>
 that you have made him into a bundle and thrown him before the elephant?<BR>
 Lifting up the bundle, the elephant bows down before it.<BR>
 The Qazi could not understand it; he was blind. ||3||<BR>
 Three times, he tried to do it.<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 21 - Raag Gond - Part 013</H2></CENTER>
 Even then, his hardened mind was not satisfied.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, such is my Lord and Master.<BR>
 The soul of His humble servant dwells in the fourth state. ||4||1||4||<BR>
 GOND:<BR>
 It is not human, and it is not a god.<BR>
 It is not called celibate, or a worshipper of Shiva.<BR>
 It is not a Yogi, and it is not a hermit.<BR>
 It is not a mother, or anyone's son. ||1||<BR>
 Then what is it, which dwells in this temple of the body?<BR>
 No one can find its limits. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 It is not a house-holder, and it is not a renouncer of the world.<BR>
 It is not a king, and it is not a beggar.<BR>
 It has no body, no drop of blood.<BR>
 It is not a Brahmin, and it is not a Kh'shaatriya. ||2||<BR>
 It is not called a man of austere self-discipline, or a Shaykh.<BR>
 It does not live, and it is not seen to die.<BR>
 If someone cries over its death,<BR>
 that person loses his honor. ||3||<BR>
 By Guru's Grace, I have found the Path.<BR>
 Birth and death have both been erased.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, this is formed of the same essence as the Lord.<BR>
 It is like the ink on the paper which cannot be erased. ||4||2||5||<BR>
 GOND:<BR>
 The threads are broken, and the starch has run out.<BR>
 Bare reeds glisten at the front door.<BR>
 The poor brushes are scattered in pieces.<BR>
 Death has entered this shaven head. ||1||<BR>
 This shaven-headed mendicant has wasted all his wealth.<BR>
 All this coming and going has irritated him. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He has given up all talk of his weaving equipment.<BR>
 His mind is attuned to the Lord's Name.<BR>
 His daughters and sons have nothing to eat,<BR>
 while the shaven-headed mendicants night and day eat their fill. ||2||<BR>
 One or two are in the house, and one or two more are on the way.<BR>
 We sleep on the floor, while they sleep in the beds.<BR>
 They rub their bare heads, and carry prayer-books in their waist-bands.<BR>
 We get dry grains, while they get loaves of bread. ||3||<BR>
 He will become one of these shaven-headed mendicants.<BR>
 They are the support of the drowning.<BR>
 Listen, O blind and unguided Loi:<BR>
 Kabeer has taken shelter with these shaven-headed mendicants. ||4||3||6||<BR>
 GOND:<BR>
 When her husband dies, the woman does not cry.<BR>
 Someone else becomes her protector.<BR>
 When this protector dies,<BR>
 he falls into the world of hell hereafter, for the sexual pleasures he enjoyed in this world. ||1||<BR>
 The world loves only the one bride, Maya.<BR>
 She is the wife of all beings and creatures. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 With her necklace around her neck, this bride looks beautiful.<BR>
 She is poison to the Saint, but the world is delighted with her.<BR>
 Adorning herself, she sits like a prostitute.<BR>
 Cursed by the Saints, she wanders around like a wretch. ||2||<BR>
 She runs around, chasing after the Saints.<BR>
 She is afraid of being beaten by those blessed with the Guru's Grace.<BR>
 She is the body, the breath of life, of the faithless cynics.<BR>
 She appears to me like a blood-thirsty witch. ||3||<BR>
 I know her secrets well<BR>
 - in His Mercy, the Divine Guru met me.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, now I have thrown her out.<BR>
 She clings to the skirt of the world. ||4||4||7||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 21 - Raag Gond - Part 014</H2></CENTER>
 GOND:<BR>
 When someone's household has no glory,<BR>
 the guests who come there depart still hungry.<BR>
 Deep within, there is no contentment.<BR>
 Without his bride, the wealth of Maya, he suffers in pain. ||1||<BR>
 So praise this bride, which can shake the consciousness of even the most dedicated ascetics and sages. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 This bride is the daughter of a wretched miser.<BR>
 Abandoning the Lord's servant, she sleeps with the world.<BR>
 Standing at the door of the holy man,<BR>
 she says, "I have come to your sanctuary; now save me!"||2||<BR>
 This bride is so beautiful.<BR>
 The bells on her ankles make soft music.<BR>
 As long as there is the breath of life in the man, she remains attached to him.<BR>
 But when it is no more, she quickly gets up and departs, bare-footed. ||3||<BR>
 This bride has conquered the three worlds.<BR>
 The eighteen Puraanas and the sacred shrines of pilgrimage love her as well.<BR>
 She pierced the hearts of Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu.<BR>
 She destroyed the great emperors and kings of the world. ||4||<BR>
 This bride has no restraint or limits.<BR>
 She is in collusion with the five thieving passions.<BR>
 When the clay pot of these five passions bursts,<BR>
 then, says Kabeer, by Guru's Mercy, one is released. ||5||5||8||<BR>
 GOND:<BR>
 As the house will not stand when the supporting beams are removed from within it,<BR>
 just so, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, how can anyone be carried across?<BR>
 Without the pitcher, the water is not contained;<BR>
 just so, without the Holy Saint, the mortal departs in misery. ||1||<BR>
 One who does not remember the Lord - let him burn;<BR>
 his body and mind have remained absorbed in this field of the world. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Without a farmer, the land is not planted;<BR>
 without a thread, how can the beads be strung?<BR>
 Without a loop, how can the knot be tied?<BR>
 Just so, without the Holy Saint, the mortal departs in misery. ||2||<BR>
 Without a mother or father there is no child;<BR>
 just so, without water, how can the clothes be washed?<BR>
 Without a horse, how can there be a rider?<BR>
 Without the Holy Saint, one cannot reach the Court of the Lord. ||3||<BR>
 Just as without music, there is no dancing,<BR>
 the bride rejected by her husband is dishonored.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, do this one thing:<BR>
 become Gurmukh, and you shall never die again. ||4||6||9||<BR>
 GOND:<BR>
 He alone is a pimp, who pounds down his mind.<BR>
 Pounding down his mind, he escapes from the Messenger of Death.<BR>
 Pounding and beating his mind, he puts it to the test;<BR>
 such a pimp attains total liberation. ||1||<BR>
 Who is called a pimp in this world?<BR>
 In all speech, one must carefully consider. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 He alone is a dancer, who dances with his mind.<BR>
 The Lord is not satisfied with falsehood; He is pleased only with Truth.<BR>
 So play the beat of the drum in the mind.<BR>
 The Lord is the Protector of the dancer with such a mind. ||2||<BR>
 She alone is a street-dancer, who cleanses her body-street,<BR>
 and educates the five passions.<BR>
 She who embraces devotional worship for the Lord<BR>
 - I accept such a street-dancer as my Guru. ||3||<BR>
 He alone is a thief, who is above envy,<BR>
 and who uses his sense organs to chant the Lord's Name.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, these are the qualities of the one<BR>
 I know as my Blessed Divine Guru, who is the most beautiful and wise. ||4||7||10||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 21 - Raag Gond - Part 015</H2></CENTER>
 GOND:<BR>
 Blessed is the Lord of the World. Blessed is the Divine Guru.<BR>
 Blessed is that grain, by which the heart-lotus of the hungry blossoms forth.<BR>
 Blessed are those Saints, who know this.<BR>
 Meeting with them, one meets the Lord, the Sustainer of the World. ||1||<BR>
 This grain comes from the Primal Lord God.<BR>
 One chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord, only when he tastes this grain. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Meditate on the Naam, and meditate on this grain.<BR>
 Mixed with water, its taste becomes sublime.<BR>
 One who abstains from this grain,<BR>
 loses his honor in the three worlds. ||2||<BR>
 One who discards this grain, is practicing hypocrisy.<BR>
 She is neither a happy soul-bride, nor a widow.<BR>
 Those who claim in this world that they live on milk alone,<BR>
 secretly eat whole loads of food. ||3||<BR>
 Without this grain, time does not pass in peace.<BR>
 Forsaking this grain, one does not meet the Lord of the World.<BR>
 Says Kabeer, this I know:<BR>
 blessed is that grain, which brings faith in the Lord and Master to the mind. ||4||8||11||<BR>
 Raag Gond, The Word Of Naam Dayv Jee, First House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 The ritual sacrifice of horses,<BR>
 giving one's weight in gold to charities,<BR>
 and ceremonial cleansing baths -||1||<BR>
 These are not equal to singing the Praises of the Lord's Name.<BR>
 Meditate on your Lord, you lazy man! ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Offering sweet rice at Gaya,<BR>
 living on the river banks at Benares,<BR>
 reciting the four Vedas by heart;||2||<BR>
 Completing all religious rituals,<BR>
 restraining sexual passion by the spiritual wisdom given by the Guru,<BR>
 and performing the six rituals;||3||<BR>
 Expounding on Shiva and Shakti<BR>
 - O man, renounce and abandon all these things.<BR>
 Meditate, meditate in remembrance on the Lord of the Universe.<BR>
 Meditate, O Naam Dayv, and cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||4||1||<BR>
 GOND:<BR>
 The deer is lured by the sound of the hunter's bell;<BR>
 it loses its life, but it cannot stop thinking about it. ||1||<BR>
 In the same way, I look upon my Lord.<BR>
 I will not abandon my Lord, and turn my thoughts to another. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 As the fisherman looks upon the fish,<BR>
 and the goldsmith looks upon the gold he fashions;||2||<BR>
 As the man driven by sex looks upon another man's wife,<BR>
 and the gambler looks upon the throwing of the dice -||3||<BR>
 In the same way, wherever Naam Dayv looks, he sees the Lord.<BR>
 Naam Dayv meditates continuously on the Feet of the Lord. ||4||2||<BR>
 GOND:<BR>
 Carry me across, O Lord, carry me across.<BR>
 I am ignorant, and I do not know how to swim. O my Beloved Father, please give me Your arm. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 I have been transformed from a mortal being into an angel, in an instant; the True Guru has taught me this.<BR>
 Born of human flesh, I have conquered the heavens; such is the medicine I was given. ||1||<BR>
 Please place me where You placed Dhroo and Naarad, O my Master.<BR>
 With the Support of Your Name, so many have been saved; this is Naam Dayv's understanding. ||2||3||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 21 - Raag Gond - Part 016</H2></CENTER>
 GOND:<BR>
 I am restless and unhappy.<BR>
 Without her calf, the cow is lonely. ||1||<BR>
 Without water, the fish writhes in pain.<BR>
 So is poor Naam Dayv without the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Like the cow's calf, which, when let loose,<BR>
 sucks at her udders and drinks her milk -||2||<BR>
 So has Naam Dayv found the Lord.<BR>
 Meeting the Guru, I have seen the Unseen Lord. ||3||<BR>
 As the man driven by sex wants another man's wife,<BR>
 so does Naam Dayv love the Lord. ||4||<BR>
 As the earth burns in the dazzling sunlight,<BR>
 so does poor Naam Dayv burn without the Lord's Name. ||5||4||<BR>
 Raag Gond, The Word Of Naam Dayv Jee, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, all doubts are dispelled.<BR>
 Chanting the Name of the Lord is the highest religion.<BR>
 Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, erases social classes and ancestral pedigrees.<BR>
 The Lord is the walking stick of the blind. ||1||<BR>
 I bow to the Lord, I humbly bow to the Lord.<BR>
 Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, you will not be tormented by the Messenger of Death. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Lord took the life of Harnaakhash,<BR>
 and gave Ajaamal a place in heaven.<BR>
 Teaching a parrot to speak the Lord's Name, Ganika the prostitute was saved.<BR>
 That Lord is the light of my eyes. ||2||<BR>
 Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Pootna was saved,<BR>
 even though she was a deceitful child-killer.<BR>
 Contemplating the Lord, Dropadi was saved.<BR>
 Gautam's wife, turned to stone, was saved. ||3||<BR>
 The Lord, who killed Kaysee and Kans,<BR>
 gave the gift of life to Kali.<BR>
 Prays Naam Dayv, such is my Lord;<BR>
 meditating on Him, fear and suffering are dispelled. ||4||1||5||<BR>
 GOND:<BR>
 One who chases after the god Bhairau, evil spirits and the goddess of smallpox,<BR>
 is riding on a donkey, kicking up the dust. ||1||<BR>
 I take only the Name of the One Lord.<BR>
 I have given away all other gods in exchange for Him. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 That man who chants "Shiva, Shiva", and meditates on him,<BR>
 is riding on a bull, shaking a tambourine. ||2||<BR>
 One who worships the Great Goddess Maya<BR>
 will be reincarnated as a woman, and not a man. ||3||<BR>
 You are called the Primal Goddess.<BR>
 At the time of liberation, where will you hide then? ||4||<BR>
 Follow the Guru's Teachings, and hold tight to the Lord's Name, O friend.<BR>
 Thus prays Naam Dayv, and so says the Gita as well. ||5||2||6||<BR>
 BILAAVAL GOND:<BR>
 Today, Naam Dayv saw the Lord, and so I will instruct the ignorant. ||Pause||<BR>
 O Pandit, O religious scholar, your Gayatri was grazing in the fields.<BR>
 Taking a stick, the farmer broke its leg, and now it walks with a limp. ||1||<BR>
 O Pandit, I saw your great god Shiva, riding along on a white bull.<BR>
 In the merchant's house, a banquet was prepared for him - he killed the merchant's son. ||2||<BR>
<CENTER><H2>Section 21 - Raag Gond - Part 017</H2></CENTER>
 O Pandit, I saw your Raam Chand coming too<BR>
 ; he lost his wife, fighting a war against Raawan. ||3||<BR>
 The Hindu is sightless; the Muslim has only one eye.<BR>
 The spiritual teacher is wiser than both of them.<BR>
 The Hindu worships at the temple, the Muslim at the mosque.<BR>
 Naam Dayv serves that Lord, who is not limited to either the temple or the mosque. ||4||3||7||<BR>
 Raag Gond, The Word Of Ravi Daas Jee, Second House:<BR>
 One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:<BR>
 Meditate on the Lord Mukanday, the Liberator, O people of the world.<BR>
 Without Mukanday, the body shall be reduced to ashes.<BR>
 Mukanday is the Giver of liberation.<BR>
 Mukanday is my father and mother. ||1||<BR>
 Meditate on Mukanday in life, and meditate on Mukanday in death.<BR>
 His servant is blissful forever. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 The Lord, Mukanday, is my breath of life.<BR>
 Meditating on Mukanday, one's forehead will bear the Lord's insignia of approval.<BR>
 The renunciate serves Mukanday.<BR>
 Mukanday is the wealth of the poor and forlorn. ||2||<BR>
 When the One Liberator does me a favor,<BR>
 then what can the world do to me?<BR>
 Erasing my social status, I have entered His Court.<BR>
 You, Mukanday, are potent throughout the four ages. ||3||<BR>
 Spiritual wisdom has welled up, and I have been enlightened.<BR>
 In His Mercy, the Lord has made this worm His slave.<BR>
 Says Ravi Daas, now my thirst is quenched;<BR>
 I meditate on Mukanday the Liberator, and I serve Him. ||4||1||<BR>
 GOND:<BR>
 Someone may bathe at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage,<BR>
 and worship the twelve Shiva-lingam stones,<BR>
 and dig wells and pools,<BR>
 but if he indulges in slander, then all of this is useless. ||1||<BR>
 How can the slanderer of the Holy Saints be saved?<BR>
 Know for certain, that he shall go to hell. ||1||Pause||<BR>
 Someone may bathe at Kuruk-shaytra during a solar eclipse,<BR>
 and give his decorated wife in offering,<BR>
 and listen to all the Simritees,<BR>
 but if he indulges in slander, these are of no account. ||2||<BR>
 Someone may give countless feasts,<BR>
 and donate land, and build splendid buildings;<BR>
 he may neglect his own affairs to work for others,<BR>
 but if he indulges in slander, he shall wander in countless incarnations. ||3||<BR>
 Why do you indulge in slander, O people of the world?<BR>
 The emptiness of the slanderer is soon exposed.<BR>
 I have thought, and determined the fate of the slanderer.<BR>
 Says Ravi Daas, he is a sinner; he shall go to hell. ||4||2||11||7||2||49|| Total||<BR>
