<P>IN the house in which God's praise is sung and He is meditated on,<BR>
Sing the Sohila and remember the Creator.<BR>
Sing the Sohila of my Fearless Lord; I am a sacrifice to that song of joy by which everlasting comfort is obtained.<BR>
Ever and ever living things are watched over; the Giver regardeth <I>their wants</I>.<BR>
When <I>even</I> Thy gifts cannot be appraised, who can appraise the Giver?<BR>
The year and the auspicious time <I>for marriage</I> are recorded; <I>relations</I> meet and pour oil on me the bride.<BR>
O my friends, pray for me that I may meet my Lord.<BR>
This message is ever sent to every house: such invitations are ever issued.<BR>
Remember the Caller; Nanak, the day is approaching.</P></DIR>

<P>There are six schools of <I>philosophy</I>, six teachers, and six doctrines.<BR>
The Guru of gurus is but one, though He hath various forms.<BR>
O father, preserve the system<BR>
In which the Creator is praised[2] that will redound to thy glory.<BR>
As there is one sun and many seasons,<BR>
In which there are wisas, chasas, gharis, pahars, lunar and week days, and months;</P></DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The collection of hymns called Sohila is repeated at bedtime by pious Sikhs. It consists of three hymns of Guru N&acirc;nak, one of Guru R&acirc;m D&acirc;s, and one of Guru Arjan. The word Sohila is derived from <I>sowam wela</I> meaning in the Panjabi language the time for sleep.</P>
<P>2 The meaning is that Guru Nanak rejects the Hindu systems.]</P>

<P>So, O Nanak, there is but one God, although His forms are many.</P></DIR>

<P>The sun and moon, <I>O Lord</I>, are Thy lamps; the firmament Thy salver; the orbs of the stars the pearls <I>enchased</I> in it.<BR>
The perfume of the sandal is Thine incense, the wind is Thy fan, all the forests are Thy flowers, O Lord of light.<BR>
What worship is this, O Thou Destroyer of birth? Unbeaten strains of ecstasy are the trumpets of Thy worship.<BR>
Thou hast a thousand eyes and yet not one eye; Thou hast a thousand forms and yet not one form;<BR>
Thou hast a thousand stainless feet and yet not one foot; Thou hast a thousand organs of smell and yet not one organ. I am fascinated by this play of Thine.<BR>
The light which is in everything is Thine, O Lord of light.<BR>
From its brilliancy everything is brilliant;<BR>
By the Guru's teaching the light becometh manifest.<BR>
What pleaseth Thee is the <I>real</I> worship.<BR>
O God, my mind is fascinated with Thy lotus feet as the bumble-bee with the flower: night and day I thirst for them.<BR>
Give the water of Thy favour to the sarang Nanak, so that he may dwell in Thy name.</P></DIR>

<P>The city[1] is greatly filled with lust and wrath; but these are destroyed on meeting the saints.<BR>
By predestination the Guru is found, and the soul is absorbed in the region of God's love.<BR>
Salute the saint with clasped hands--this is a greatly meritorious act.<BR>
Prostrate thyself before him--this is a greatly religious act.<BR>
The infidel knoweth not the taste of God's essence; he beareth the thorn of pride in his heart.<BR>
The more he moveth, the more it pricketh him, and the more pain he feeleth: his head shall feel death's mace.</P></DIR>

<P>The saints of God are absorbed in God's name, and have destroyed the pain and fear of transmigration.<BR>
They have found God the imperishable Being, and great honour is theirs in the earth's continents and the universe.<BR>
O God, we poor, and wretched, are Thine; preserve us, preserve us, Thou greatest of the great!<BR>
The Name is Nanak's support and prop; I have obtained happiness through being absorbed only in God's name.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">GURU ARJAN, RAG GAURI PURBI</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>I pray you hear me, my friends, it is time to serve the saints.<BR>
Earn here the profit of God's name, and in the next world ye shall abide in happiness.<BR>
Human life groweth shorter every day and night O man, meet the Guru and arrange thine affairs.<BR>
This world is involved in wickedness and superstition they who know God are saved.<BR>
He whom God awakeneth and causeth to drink the essence <I>of His word</I>, knoweth the story of the Ineffable.[1]<BR>
Purchase that[2] for which thou hast come into the world, and God by the Guru's favour will dwell in thy heart.<BR>
Thou shalt find a home with comfort and peace in God's own palace, and not return again to this world.<BR>
O God, Searcher of hearts, Arranger,[3] fulfil the desires of my heart.<BR>
The slave Nanak craveth the happiness of being made the dust of the saints' feet.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. This and the concluding portion of the preceding line are also translated--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>He whom the saint who knoweth God awakeneth, shall be saved,<BR>
And shall quaff the essence of God's name: it is he who knoweth the story of the Ineffable.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>2. God's name.</P>
<P>3. The gy&acirc;nis often translate Bidh&acirc;ta--He who gives man the fruit of his acts. The third Guru uses the expression in the same sense.]</P>
