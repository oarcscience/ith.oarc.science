<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">THE JAPJI[1]</H2>
<P>THERE is but one God whose name is true, the Creator,[2] devoid of fear and enmity, immortal, unborn, self-existent by the favour of the Guru.[4]</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">REPEAT HIS NAME</P>
<P>The True One was in the beginning; the True One was in the primal age.</P>
<P>The True One is[5] now also, O Nanak; the True One also shall be.[6]</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The Japji is considered by the Sikhs a key to their sacred volume and an epitome of its doctrines. It is silently repeated by the Sikhs early in the morning. Every Sikh must have it by heart, otherwise he is not deemed orthodox. It is the duty of all Sikhs, even if they cannot read, to have themselves taught this eat morning divine service. The composition appears to have been the work of Guru N&acirc;nak in advanced age.</P>
<P>2. <I>Karta purukh</I>. It is perhaps not necessary to translate the word <I>purukh</I>. It means male or creative agency. The all-pervading spirit in union with a female element uttered a word from which sprang creation.</P>
<P>3. <I>Saibhan</I> is derived from the Sanskrit <I>swayambhu</I>, which we have found in this passage in a very ancient Sikh MS.</P>
<P>4 <I>Gur Pars&acirc;d</I>. We have translated these words in deference to the opinions of the majority of the Sikhs; but with several carried gy&acirc;nis we have no doubt that they were intended as epithets of God--the great and bountiful. Guru Nanak had no human guru; as we have already seen, his guru was God. It was during the spiritual supremacy of his Successors the favour of the Guru was invoked, and deemed indispensable for deliverance. Moreover, though <I>gur pars&acirc;d</I> does sometimes in the Granth S&acirc;hib mean the Guru's favour, this appears to be more often expressed by <I>gur pars&acirc;di</I>.</P>
<P>5. <I>Bhi</I>. There are two <I>bhi</I>s in this line which some say are idiomatic. We have very little doubt that the first <I>bhi</I> is an obsolete past tense of the defective verb <I>bhu</I>, and that the verse ought to be translated 'The True One is, was, and also shall be.' Compare--'Guru N&acirc;nak, Shahu hai, bhi, hosi.'--S&ucirc;hi Ashtapadi 1.</P>
<P>6. Also translated--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>God was true in the beginning, he was true in the primal age<BR>
He is true now also, N&acirc;nak, and He also will be true.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>{footnote p. 196} This translation appears to be unmeaning, for it is not doubted that God was true in all ages. With the translation in the text compare {Greek <I>E?gw' ei`mi pa^n to' gegonos, kai` o?'n, kai` e?so'menon</I>}, 'I am all that was, and is, and will be.'--Inscription on a Greek temple.]</P>

<P>By thinking I cannot obtain a conception <I>of Him</I>, even though I think hundreds of thousands of times.<BR>
Even though I be silent and keep my attention firmly fixed on Him, I cannot preserve silence.<BR>
The hunger of the hungry <I>for God</I> subsideth not though they obtain the load of the worlds.<BR>
If man should have thousands and hundreds of thousands of devices, even one would not assist him in obtaining God.<BR>
How shall <I>man</I> become true before God? How shall the veil of falsehood be rent?[1]<BR>
By walking, O Nanak, according to the will[2] of the Commander as preordained.</P></DIR>

By His order some obtain their reward;[4] by His order others must ever wander in transmigration.<BR>
All are subject to His order; none is exempt from it.<BR>
He who understandeth God's order, O Nanak, is never guilty of egoism.[5]</P></DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. This verse is also translated--By our former acts we acquire this <I>human</I> vesture, and by God's favour reach the gate of salvation.</P>
<P>The body is first formed, and then the soul from another body enters it. God decides in what body the soul is to have residence until the, body perishes. The acts of previous births are adjusted when the soul attains a human body. It is the acts done in human body which accompany the soul to future states of existence.</P>
