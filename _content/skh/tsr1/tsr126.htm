<P>When Guru Nanak visited Ceylon he gave the following advice to its queen, who was proud of her beauty and her state:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Hear, young woman with the gazelle eyes, hear my serious and weighty words.<BR>
First examine thy goods and make thy traffic.<BR>
Dismiss[1] the evil and welcome the good.<BR>
Consider, O young woman, what proclamation to give by which thou mayest find friends.<BR>
Give thy soul and body to thy friends, and thou shalt thus enjoy the utmost hilarity.<BR>
Love not that which is transitory<BR>
Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who understand this.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>In spiritual matters consult the holy:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>If thou art to cross the. water, consult those who have the skill to cross:<BR>
They are very wise and will keep clear of the whirlpool.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The dangers of the world:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>There are continual showers, squalls, and torrents hundreds of thousands of waves succeed one another.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. <I>Dohi dichai</I>. Literally-make a proclamation to depart.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 380}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Address the True Guru, and there shall be no fear that thy bark will founder.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Another of the Guru's reflections on the sinfulness of his age:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Nanak, to what hath the world come?<BR>
No companion or friend remaineth.<BR>
Love hath ceased among brethren and kinsmen<BR>
Faith is lost on account of mammon.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The following was composed by Guru Nanak on seeing women mourning:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>They are saying 'Hai hai!' and 'Oh Oh!';<BR>
They beat their cheeks and pluck out the hairs of their heads;<BR>
They utter God's name[1] <I>without meaning it: if they</I> were absorbed in it,<BR>
Then would Nanak be a sacrifice unto them.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The Guru went to visit a man of reputed sanctity, but on finding him a hypocrite composed the following:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The raven washeth and rubbeth itself in a small pool in the desert;<BR>
Its mind and body are full of demerits and its beak of filth.<BR>
The swan of the lake, not knowing that the raven was an evil bird, associated with him.<BR>
Such is affection for the infidel; O man of divine knowledge, understand the allusion.<BR>
Congratulate the congregation of the saints, and act like a holy man.<BR>
Pure is the ablution, O Nanak, when the Guru is deemed the river of pilgrimage.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The really holy are few:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The saints are few, not many; deceit and wrangling Prevail in the world.[2]</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. <I>Oh hai</I>. He is.</P>
<P>2. Also translated--They who act as become faq&icirc;rs are few in the world.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 381}</P>
<P>The following has reference to the concremation of widows:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Nanak, <I>the widow</I> followeth her <I>husband</I> and dieth; she hath no power to live.<BR>
But she who dieth struck <I>by the news of her husband's death</I> is acceptable.<BR>
When the Allwise hath struck her with the arrow of love it cannot be extracted.<BR>
She whom God hath struck with it is struck, and being struck is acceptable.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The body is frail and cannot be saved without God's grace:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Who can wash a vessel which is fragile in its construction?<BR>
The body is a compound of five elements; it hath a false gilding.<BR>
If it please God, the vessel shall be acceptable,<BR>
The supreme light shall shine and God's praises resound in it.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Pride without merit:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Nanak, those men are the real donkeys who are proud without merit.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>A definition of a Brahman:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>He is a Brahman who knoweth God,<BR>
Who performeth works of devotion, penance, and self-restraint;<BR>
And who observeth the religion of mildness and patience.<BR>
Such a Brahman shall burst his bonds, obtain salvation,.<BR>
And be worthy of worship.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>A definition of a Khatri:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>He is a Khatri who is brave in good deeds<BR>
And who employeth his body in charity.[1]<BR>
The Khatri who inspecteth his ground before sowing his gifts,</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. That is, who sacrifices himself for others.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 382}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Shall be acceptable in <I>God's</I> court.<BR>
The Khatri who practiseth greed, covetousness, and falsehood,<BR>
Shall suffer for his misdeeds.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The Guru required complete self-sacrifice from his disciples:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>If thou desire to play at love with me,<BR>
Come my way with thy head in the palm of thy hand.<BR>
Put thy feet on this road;<BR>
Give thy head and regard not human opinion.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The Guru, faith, truth, and the capital of God's name are necessary for salvation:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Without the Guru there is no divine knowledge, without faith no meditation;<BR>
Without truth there is no credit, and without capital no balance.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>If Ram had been God he would not have lost his queen Sita, and he would himself have healed his half-brother Lachhman instead of calling on Hanuman to do so:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Ram Chandar mourned in his soul for Sita and Lachhman<BR>
He remembered Hanuman,[l] and he came to meet him.<BR>
The misguided demon <I>Rawan</I> did not know it was <I>not Ram but God</I> who did this.<BR>
Nanak, God is independent: Ram could not erase his destiny.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>A purse-proud person addressed improper language to the Guru. When the Guru's disciples took this amiss, the Guru uttered the following:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Impute not blame to the Rai;[2] his intellect is forsaking him in his old age.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. See the story of Hanum&acirc;n going for a plant to heal Lachhman, in Dowson's <I>Dictionary of Hindu Mythology</I>.</P>
<P>2. This word means a nobleman.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 383}</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The blind man talketh much and falleth into the pit.<BR>
Whatever the Perfect One hath done is perfect; there is no deficiency or excess in it.<BR>
Nanak, the pious who know this, shall be absorbed in the Perfect One.</P></DIR>
