<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">LIFE OF GURU NANAK</H1>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">CHAPTER I</H2>
<P>To recapitulate what has been more fully stated in the Introduction, Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh religion, was born, according to all ancient Sikh records, in the early morning of the third day of the light half of the month of Baisakh (April-May) in the year A.D. 1469; but for convenience sake his anniversary is now observed by the Sikhs on the occasion of the full moon in the month of Kartik (October-November). His father, who was called Kalu, was accountant in the village of Talwandi in the present Lahore District of the Panjab, and his mother was Tripta, memorable in Sikh writings for heir devotion to her son.</P>
<P>The Sikh biographers recount in minute detail all the circumstances of the birth of Guru Nanak. Daulatan, a midwife, assisted on the occasion. When next morning interrogated by the astrologer Hardial, who came to write the child's horoscope, as to the nature of the voice uttered by him at birth, she said it was as the laughing voice of a wise man joining a social gathering; and she expressed herself at her wits' end to comprehend the child's nature. The astrologer desired to see him, but his mother refused owing to the chillness of the weather. He pressed the matter, and the child was brought to him in his swaddling clothes. The astrologer on seeing the infant is said to have worshipped him with clasped hands. He declared the child should wear the umbrella, the symbol of regal or prophetic dignity in the East. At the same time he regretted that he should never live to see young Nanak's eminence, worshipped as he should be alike by Hindus and Musalmans, and not merely by Hindus</P>
<P>{p. 2}</P>
<P>as in the previous human manifestations of the Creator. The child's name should resound both in earth and heaven. Inanimate nature should cry out 'Nanak, Nanak!' He should have power over matter so as to traverse unscathed the depths of the ocean. He should worship and acknowledge but one God, and the creature he should treat as a creature. In other words he should be a monotheist, not a worshipper of minor deities and idols.</P>
<P>At the unripe age of five years Nanak is said to have begun to talk of divine subjects, and to have fully understood the meaning of his language. Great trust was reposed in him; and both Hindus and Musalmans lavished on him. their characteristic language of religious adulation.</P>
<P>At Nankana[1] every place with which Nanak had any association is deemed sacred. On the spot where he used to play with children of his own age and subsequently spend nights in devotion, there was a small tank constructed by Rai Bular, the landlord of the village, in affectionate remembrance of the childhood of the Guru, at a time when his fame had extended far and wide. The tank was greatly enlarged by Kaura Mal, the Diwan or financial minister of Zakaria Khan, who was satrap of Lahore. Kaura Mal was an enthusiastic admirer of Guru Nanak, and lent his great material and political influence to the amelioration of the condition of the Sikhs. The spot is called Balkrira or the child's playground.</P>
<P>When Nanak was seven years of age, his father in the manner of Hindus asked the village astrologer to select an auspicious time for the commencement of the boy's education. The schoolmaster thought the time had arrived. The school appears to have been a humble one, and the tuition fees not exorbitant. Kalu's wife and not, as in modern times, the village moneylender was the custodian of the wealth of the house. Kalu took from her a coin corresponding to three</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. By which name Talwandi is now known.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 3}</P>
<P>farthings of English money, some betel-nut, and rice, and presented them to the schoolmaster with his son. In India wooden tablets painted black are employed in teaching children the letters of their language. The schoolmaster writes the letters with a kind of liquid chalk on the tablet; and the children repeat their names aloud with much noise and energy. The schoolmaster wrote the alphabet for Nanak, and the latter copied it from memory after one day.</P>
<P>It is said that on that occasion the young Guru made an acrostic on his alphabet. As in similar compositions in other languages, the letters were taken consecutively, and words whose initials they formed were employed to give metrical expression to the Guru's divine aspirations, his tenets, and his admiration of the attributes of the Creator.</P>
<P>The acrostic called the patti or tablet in the Rag[1] Asa is as follows:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>S. The one Lord who created the world is the Lord of all.<BR>
Fortunate is their advent into the world, whose hearts remain attached to God's service.<BR>
O foolish man, why hast thou forgotten Him?<BR>
When thou adjustest thine account, my friend, thou shalt be <I>deemed</I> educated.</P>
<P>I. The Primal Being is the Giver; He alone is true.<BR>
No account shall be due by the pious man who understandeth by means of these letters.</P></DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. In Sikh writings this world is likened to a terrible and stormy ocean which can only be traversed with difficulty, and in which man is ever liable to founder without spiritual guidance. The Guru supplies a boat for salvation.</P>
<P>2. <I>Karma</I> are acts which follow the soul in its transmigration and hinder its progress to Nirv&acirc;n.</P>
<P>3 The Gurus speak of God as a husband and themselves as His wives; and spiritual happiness they liken to connubial bliss. This belief has to some extent a parallel in Greek mythology. Psyche, the human soul, having forfeited--the love of Eros, the divine soul, endured various sufferings; to regain the affection of her lover.]</P><DIR>

He giveth eating and drinking equally to all, and ordereth them as He pleaseth.</P>

Seeth, tasteth, and knoweth everything; He is contained within and without the world.</P>
<P>R. Why quarrel, O mortal? meditate on God, under whose order is <I>creation</I>.<BR>
Meditate on Him; be absorbed in the True One; and be a sacrifice unto Him.</P>
<P>H. There is no other Giver than He who created creatures and gave them sustenance.<BR>
Meditate on God's name; be absorbed in God's name, and thou shalt night and day derive profit therefrom.</P></DIR>

<P>A. What God who made <I>the world</I> hath to do He continueth to do.<BR>
He acteth and causeth others to act; He knoweth everything; thus saith the poet Nanak.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Nanak appears to have continued to attend school for some time. One day he was observed to remain silent, and not apply himself to his books. The schoolmaster asked him why he was not reading. Nanak inquired, 'Art thou sufficiently learned to teach me?' The schoolmaster replied that he had read everything. He knew the Veds and Shastars,[1] and he had learned to cast up accounts, post ledgers and daybooks, and strike balances. Upon this Nanak said, 'To your accomplishments I prefer the study of divine knowledge'. He then composed the following hymn:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Burn worldly love, grind <I>its ashes</I> and make it into ink;[2] turn superior intellect into paper.<BR>
Make divine love thy pen, and thy heart the writer; ask thy guru and write his instruction.<BR>
Write <I>God's</I> name, write His praises, write that He hath neither end nor limit.<BR>
O master, learn to write this account,<BR>
So that, whenever it is called for, a true mark may be found thereon.<BR>
There[3] greatness is obtained, everlasting joys, and everlasting delights.<BR>
They in whose hearts is the true have the marks of it on their brows.</P></DIR>

<P>By God's mercy men obtain it and not by idle words.<BR>
One man cometh, another goeth; we give them great names.[1]<BR>
Some men God created to beg, and some to <I>preside over</I> great courts.<BR>
When they have departed, they shall know that without the Name[2] they are of no account.<BR>

They who have been called kings and lords are beheld as ashes.<BR>
Nanak,[3] when man departeth all false affections are sundered.[4]</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Upon this the schoolmaster became astonished, did Nanak homage as a perfect saint, and told him to do what he pleased.</P>
<P>Nanak, having thus shown his scholastic proficiency, left school and took to private study and meditation. He remained for long periods in the same attitude, whether sleeping or waking, and associated continually with religious men.</P>

<P>2. In the Sikh writings the word Name is frequently used for God. A somewhat similar practice was known to the ancient Jews (Amos vii. 10). At a time too early to be traced the Jews abstained from pronouncing the name Jehovah for fear of its irreverent use, and uttered instead Adonai or Lord. in connexion with this we may say that the repetition of God's name is one of the principal forms of Sikh worship. Set forms of prayer are apt to be repeated mechanically or ostentatiously; and it was believed that by the constant heartfelt repetition of God's name man should be eventually absorbed in Him, and thus obtain the supreme object of human birth after countless transmigrations.</P>
<P>2. In Oriental poetical works it is usual for the poet to insert his real or assumed name--<I>takhallus-</I>-in the end of a composition or section of it composition. This practice is unknown to European poets except in the case of professed imitators of Oriental poetry. Were we therefore to omit the word 'N&acirc;nak' wherever it occurs, we should be consulting the taste of European readers, but the Sikhs do not desire such an Omission.</P>
<P>4 Sri R&acirc;g.]</P>
</FONT><P>religions has been made the subject of many a boast on the part of their followers. The object, of course, is that the acquirements and utterances of the religious teachers may be attributed solely to divine inspiration. We see no reason for ascribing a want of education to the founder of the Sikh religion; and the manner in which his learning was acquired is not difficult to understand. Had he remained at the humble village school, there is no reason to suppose that he would have acquired any considerable knowledge, but in the dense forests around Talwandi were to be found ascetics and anchorets who sought the extreme retirement of the locality for the combined objects of undisturbed prayer and escape from the persecution of bigoted Moslem rulers. All the Janamsakhis are unanimous in stating that Nanak courted the retirement of the forest and the society of the religious men who frequented it. Several of them were profoundly versed in the Indian religious literature of the age. They had also travelled far and wide within the limits of Hindustan, and met its renowned religious teachers. Nanak thus became acquainted with the latest teachings of Indian philosophers and reformers. The satisfaction which he derived from spiritual thought and religious association he thus expressed:--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Let Jogis practise Jog,[1] let gluttons practise gluttony,<BR>
Let penitents practise penance, and rub and bathe themselves at places of pilgrimage;<BR>
But let me listen to Thy songs, O Beloved, if any will sit and sing them to me.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The names of the men with whom Nanak associated in the forest and who sang to him the songs of the Lord are all lost, and their excellences merged as</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. <I>Jog</I>, connected with the Greek {Greek zugo'n}, originally meant the union of the soul with God, and may be compared with the etymological meaning of the word 'religion'. They who practised Jog were called Jogis. The word Jog is now applied to certain practices of the Jogis which are detailed in the <I>Aphorisms of Patanjali</I>.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 11}</P>
<P>by a process of nirvan in the religious splendour of the founder of the Sikh religion. But more perhaps than learning from the lips of religious masters were his own undisturbed communings with nature, with his own soul, and with his Creator. The voice that had spoken to many a seer again became vocal in that wilderness, and raised Nanak's thoughts to the summit of religious exaltation. In summer's heat and winter's frost, in the glory of the firmament, in the changeful aspects of nature, as well as in the joys and sorrows of the inhabitants of his little natal village, he read in bright characters and repeated with joyous iteration the name of the Formless Creator. The Name henceforth became the object of his continual worship and meditation and indeed one of the distinctive features of his creed.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>As a man soweth so shall he reap; as he earneth so shall he eat.<BR>
No inquiry shall be made hereafter <I>regarding the utterers of the Name</I>. With banners <I>flying</I> shall they go to heaven.[1]<BR>
Men are judged according to their acts.<BR>
The breath drawn without the thought of God is wasted in vain.<BR>
I would sell this body if only I found a purchaser.<BR>
Nanak, the body which is not filled with the true Name is of no account.[2]</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>There is also proof from the satisfactory internal evidence of his own compositions that Guru Nanak studied the Persian language. Kalu felt that the society of religious men was not likely to advance his son's secular interests. Rai Bular promised that if Nanak learned Persian, in which all state documents and accounts were then written, he would appoint him village accountant in succession to his father. Persian was never the tongue of Hindus, and was despised by them as the language of foreigners and conquerors</P>

<P>and of impure Musalman literature;[1] but Hindus in the age of Nanak applied themselves to it as they do now--for the simple purpose of obtaining a livelihood. Nanak soon astonished his Persian as he had previously astonished his Hindu teacher. In reply to Rukn-ul-Din's injunctions he assumed the r&ocirc;le of teacher in turn and composed the following acrostic on the letters of the Persian alphabet</P><DIR>

In the institutes of Par&acirc;sar there is found an injunction not to speak the language of the inhabitants of Yavan--a word which originally meant Greece, but was afterwards applied to Arabia--even though it save life from issuing by the throat.

His words are now understood by the Hindus to refer to the language of the Musalmans, though there were no Musalmans for centuries after his time.</P>

<P>There are numerous Persian words and some Persian verses of the Guru found in the Granth Sahib, and it may be accepted as a fact that. he became a fair Persian scholar. It is highly probable that his habit of free thought and toleration for other men's opinions were assisted by his perusal of the Muhammadan writings with which the Persian language abounds.</P>
<P>It does not appear that even the acquisition of Persian tended to give Nanak's thoughts a more practical direction. His father thought him insane, and was sore distressed for his future. He, however, sent him to herd buffaloes in the adjoining forest. Matters progressed smoothly for one day, but the next day Nanak fell asleep, and his cattle trespassed on a neighbour's field. The owner remonstrated, but Nanak said that God would bless the field. The owner was not to be diverted by this unpractical defence. He complained to Rai Bular, and the latter, hearing that Nanak was insane, was not content to send for him, but also for his father to adjust the quarrel. Nanak said that no injury had befallen the field: it was blessed by God. Rai Bular sent his own messengers to inspect the spot. On their arrival they found that not one blade had been trampled on or eaten. The field where this miracle is said to have occurred is pointed out to visitors. It is known as the Kiara Sahib, or the parterre <I>par excellence</I>.</P>
