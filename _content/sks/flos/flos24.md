### CHAPTER XXII.

#### SUNDRY SUPERSTITIONS.

<span class="smallcaps">Almanacs</span>.—In Shakespeare's day these were
published under this title:—"An Almanack and Prognostication made for
the year of our Lord God, 1595." So in the "Winter's Tale" (iv. 3),
Autolycus says—"the hottest day prognostication proclaims; "that is, the
hottest day foretold in the almanac. In the xivth sonnet the
prognostications in almanacs are also noticed:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;  
 And yet methinks I have astronomy,  
 But not to tell of good or evil luck,  
 Of plagues, of dearths, or season's quality:  
 Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,  
 Pointing to each his thunder, rain, and wind;  
 Or say with princes if it shall go well,  
 By oft predict that I in heaven find."</span>

</div>

   In "Antony and Cleopatra" (i. 2) Enobarbus says—"They are greater
storms and tempests than almanacs can report;" and in "2 Henry IV." (ii.
4), Prince Henry says—"Saturn and Venus this year in conjunction! what
says the almanac to that?"

   *Amulets*.—A belief in the efficacy of an amulet or charm to ward off
diseases and to avert contagion has prevailed from a very early period.
The use of amulets was common among the Greeks and Romans, whose amulets
were principally formed of gems, crowns of pearls, necklaces of coral,
shells, &c. The amulet of modern times has been of the most varied
kinds; objects being selected either from the animal, vegetable, or
mineral kingdom, pieces of old rags or garments, scraps of writing in
legible or illegible characters

<span id="page_475">p. 475</span>

in fact, of anything to which any superstitious property has been
considered to belong." <span id="fr_944"></span>[1](#fn_941) This form
of superstition is noticed in I Henry VI. (v. 3) in the scene laid at
Angiers where La Pucelle exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The regent conquers, and the Frenchmen fly.  
 Now help, ye charming spells and periapts."</span>

</div>

—periapts being charms which were worn as preservatives against diseases
or mischief. Thus Cotgrave <span id="fr_945"></span>[2](#fn_942)
explains the word as "a medicine hanged about any part of the bodie."

   *Ceremonies*.—These, says Malone, were "omens or signs deduced from
sacrifices or other ceremonial rites." Thus, in "Julius Cæsar" (ii. 1),
Cassius says of Cæsar, that—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">       "He is superstitious grown of late,  
Quite from the main opinion he held once  
Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies," &c.</span>

</div>

And in the next scene Calpurnia adds—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Cæsar, I never stood on ceremonies,  
 Yet now they fright me."</span>

</div>

   *Charms*.—These, as Mr Pettigrew <span
id="fr_946"></span>[3](#fn_943) has pointed out, differ little from
amulets, the difference consisting in the manner in which they are used
rather than in their nature. Thus, whereas the amulet was to be
suspended on the person when employed, the charm was not necessarily
subjected to such a method of application. In days gone by, and even at
the present day, in country districts, so universal has been the use of
this source of supposed magical power that there is scarcely a disease
for which a charm has not been given. It is not only, also, to diseases
of body and mind that the superstitious practice has been directed;
having been in popular request to avert evil, and to counteract supposed
malignant influences. As might be expected, Shakespeare

<span id="page_476">p. 476</span>

has given various allusions to this usage, as, for example, in
"Cymbeline" (v. 3), where Posthumus says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"To day how many would have given their honours  
 To have saved their carcases! took heel to do’t,  
 And yet died too! I, in my own woe charm’d,  
 Could not find death where I did hear him groan,  
 Nor feel him where he struck."</span>

</div>

this passage referring to the notion of certain charms being powerful
enough to keep men unhurt in battle.

   Othello (iii. 4), speaking of the handkerchief which he had given to
Desdemona, relates:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"That handkerchief  
 Did an Egyptian to my mother give;  
 She was a charmer, and almost could read  
 The thoughts of people."</span>

</div>

And in the same play (i. 1), Brabantio asks—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                   "Is there not charms  
By which the property of youth and maidhood  
May be abused?"</span>

</div>

   Again, in "Much Ado About Nothing" (iii. 2), Benedick, who is
represented as having the toothache, after listening to the banter of
his comrades, replies, "Yet is this no charm for the toothache."

   Perfect silence seems to have been regarded as indispensable for the
success of any charm; and Pliny informs us that "favete linguis" was the
usual exclamation employed on such an occasion. From this circumstance
it has been suggested that the well-known phrase "to charm a tongue" may
have originated. Thus we have the following dialogue in "Othello" (v.
2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Iago*.                          Go to, charm your
tongue.  
*Emilia*. I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak."</span>

</div>

   Thus, on the appearance amidst thunder of the first apparition to
Macbeth, after the witches have performed certain charms (iv. i),
Shakespeare introduces the following dialogue—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Macbeth*. Tell me thou unknown power.  
 *First Witch*.              He knows thy thoughts:  
Hear his speech, but say thou nought."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_477">p. 477</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Again in the
"Tempest" (iv. 1), Prospero says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                      "Hush, and be mute,  
Or else our spell is marr’d."</span>

</div>

   *Metrical Charms*.—There was a superstition long prevalent that life
might be taken away by metrical charms. Reginald Scot, in his "Discovery
of Witchcraft" (1584), says—"The Irishmen addict themselves, &c.; yea,
they will not sticke to affirme that they can *rime* a man to
death." <span id="fr_947"></span>[1](#fn_944)\* In "1 Henry VI." (i. 1),
the Duke of Exeter, referring to the lamented death of Henry V., says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">   "Shall we think the subtle-witted French  
Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him,  
By magic verses have contrived his end."</span>

</div>

These "magic verses," to which the death of Henry V. is here attributed,
were not required to be uttered in his presence; their deadly energy
existing solely in the words of the imprecation and the malevolence of
the reciter, which were supposed to render them effectual at any
distance.

   Again, the alphabet was called the Christ-cross-row; either because a
cross was prefixed to the alphabet in the old primers, or more probably
from a superstitious custom of writing the alphabet in the form of a
cross by way of a charm. In "Richard III." (i. 1), Clarence relates how
the king—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Hearkens after prophecies and dreams;  
 And from the cross-row plucks the letter G."</span>

</div>

   *Dreams*.—These, considered as prognostics of good or evil, are
frequently introduced by Shakespeare. In "Troilus and Cressida" (v. 3),
Andromache exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"My dreams will, sure, prove ominous to the
day."</span>

</div>

While Romeo (v. 1), declares—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"My dreams presage some joyful news at hand."</span>

</div>

It is chiefly as precursors of misfortune that the poet has availed
himself of their supposed influence as omens of future fate. Thus, there
are few passages in his dramas more terrific than the dreams of Richard
the Third and Clarence; the latter especially, as Mr Drake says, <span
id="fr_948"></span>[2](#fn_945) "is replete with the

<span id="page_478">p. 478</span>

most fearful imagery, and makes the blood run chill with horror."

   Dreaming of certain things has generally been supposed to be ominous
either of good or ill-luck; <span id="fr_949"></span>[1](#fn_946) and at
the present day the credulous pay oftentimes no small attention to their
dreams, should these happen to have referred to what they consider
unlucky things. In the same way Shylock, in the "Merchant of Venice"
(ii. 5), is a victim to much superstitious dread—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Jessica, my girl,  
Look to my house. I am right loath to go:  
There is some ill a brewing towards my rest,  
For I did dream of money-bags to-night."</span>

</div>

In "Julius Cæsar" dreaming of banquet is supposed to presage misfortune.

   It was also supposed that malicious spirits took advantage of sleep
to torment their victims; <span id="fr_950"></span>[2](#fn_947) hence
Macbeth (ii. 1), exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                          "Merciful powers,  
Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature  
Gives way to in repose!" <span id="fr_951"></span>[3](#fn_948)</span>

</div>

   *Duels*.—The death of the vanquished person was always considered a
certain evidence of his guilt. Thus in "2 Henry VI." (ii. 3), King Henry
speaking of the death of Horner in the duel with Peter, says— <span
id="fr_952"></span>[4](#fn_949)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Go, take hence that traitor from our sight;  
 For by his death we do perceive his guilt:  
 And God in justice hath reveal’d to us  
 The truth and innocence of this poor fellow,  
 Which he hath thought to have murder’d wrongfully,  
 Come, fellow, follow us for thy reward."</span>

</div>

We may also compare what Arcite says to Palamon in the "Two Noble
Kinsmen" (iii. 6)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"If I fall, curse me, and say I was a coward;  
 For none but such dare die in these just trials."</span>

</div>

Among the customs connected with duelling, it appears that, according to
an old law, knights were to fight with the lance

<span id="page_479">p. 479</span>

and the sword, as those of inferior rank fought with an ebon staff or
batoon, to the farther end of which was fixed a bag crammed hard with
sand. Thus Shakespeare, in "2 Henry VI." (ii. 3), represents Horner
entering "bearing his staff with a sand-bag fastened to it." <span
id="fr_953"></span>[1](#fn_950)\* Butler, in his "Hudibras," alludes to
this custom—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Engag’d with money bags, as bold  
 As men with sand-bags did of old."</span>

</div>

   Steevens adds that "a passage in St Chrysostom very clearly proves
the great antiquity of this practice."

   *Fortune-tellers*.—A common method of fortune-tellers in pretending
to tell future events, was by means of a beryl or glass. In an extract
from the "Penal Laws against Witches," it is said, "they do answer
either by voice, or else set before their eyes in glasses, chrystal
stones, etc., the pictures or images of the persons or things sought
for." It is to this kind of juggling prophecy that Angelo in "Measure
for Measure" (ii. 2), refers, when he tells how the law—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                            "Like a prophet,  
Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,  
Either new, or by remissness new-conceived," etc.</span>

</div>

   Again, Macbeth (iv. f), when "a show of eight kings" is presented to
him, exclaims after witnessing the seventh—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                           "I'll see no more:  
And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass  
Which shows me many more."</span>

</div>

   Spenser <span id="fr_954"></span>[2](#fn_951) has given a
circumstantial account of the glass which Merlin made for King Ryence. A
mirror of the same kind was presented to Cambuslan, in the "Squire's
Tale" of Chaucer; and we are also told how "a certain philosopher did
the like to Pompey, the which showed him in a glass the order of his
enemies’ march." <span id="fr_955"></span>[3](#fn_952) Brand, in his
"Popular Antiquities," <span id="fr_956"></span>[4](#fn_953) gives
several interesting accounts of this method of fortune-telling; and
quotes the following from Vallancey's "Collectanea de Rebus
Hibernicis:"—"In the Highlands of Scotland, a large chrystal, of a
figure somewhat

<span id="page_480">p. 480</span>

oval was kept by the priests to work charms by; water poured upon it at
this day is given to cattle against diseases; these stones are now
preserved by the oldest and most superstitious in the country; they were
once common in Ireland."

   Further allusions to fortune-tellers occur in "Comedy of Errors" (v.
1), and "Merry Wives of Windsor" (iv. 2).

   It appears, too, that the trade of fortune-telling was in
Shakespeare's day, as now, exercised by the wandering hordes of gipsies.
In "Antony and Cleopatra" (iv. 12), the Roman complains that Cleopatra—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,  
 Beguiled me to the very heart of loss."</span>

</div>

   *Giants*.—The belief in giants and other monsters was much credited
in olden times, and, "amongst the legends of nearly every race or tribe,
few are more universal than those relating to giants or men of colossal
size and superhuman power." <span id="fr_957"></span>[1](#fn_954) That
such stories were current in Shakespeare's day, is attested by the fact
that the poet makes Othello (i. 3), in his eloquent defence before the
Senate of Venice, when explaining his method of courtship, allude to—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"—The Cannibals that each other eat,  
 The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads  
 Do grow beneath their shoulders."</span>

</div>

In the "Tempest" (iii. 3), Gonzalo relates how—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                          "When we were boys,  
Who would believe that there were mountaineers  
Dew-lapp’d like bulls, whose throats had hanging at ’em  
Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men,  
Whose heads stood in their breasts?"</span>

</div>

And after the appearance of Prospero's magic repast, Sebastian says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                      "Now I will believe  
That there are unicorns, that in Arabia  
There is one tree, the phœnix's throne, one phœnix  
At this hour reigning there."</span>

</div>

   Amongst the numerous references to giants by Shakespeare, we may
quote the following. In "2 Henry VI." (ii. 3), Horner

<span id="page_481">p. 481</span>

says—"Peter, have at thee with a downright blow, \[as Bevis of
Southampton fell upon Ascapart\]." <span id="fr_958"></span>[1](#fn_955)

   Ascapart, according to the legend, was "ful thyrty fote longe," and
was conquered by Sir Bevis of Southampton.

   In "Cymbeline" (iii. 3), Belarius says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                      "The gates of monarchs  
Are arch’d so high, that giants may jet through  
And keep their impious turbans on, without  
Good morrow to the sun."</span>

</div>

   In the "Merry Wives of Windsor" (ii. 1), Mrs Page says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I had rather be a giantess, and lie under Mount
Pelion." <span id="fr_959"></span>[2](#fn_956)</span>

</div>

   *Lucky Days*.—From the most remote period certain days have been
supposed to be just as lucky as others are the reverse, a notion which
is not confined to any one country. In Shakespeare's day great attention
was paid to this superstitious fancy, which is probably alluded to in
the "Winter's Tale" (iii. 3), where the shepherd says to the clown,
"’Tis a lucky day, boy; and we'll do good deeds on’t."

   In "King John" (iii. 1) Constance exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"What hath this day deserved? what hath it done,  
 That it in golden letters should be set  
 Among the high tides in the calendar?  
 Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,  
 This day of shame, oppression, perjury.  
 Or, if it must stand still, let wives with child  
 Pray that their burthens may not fall this day,  
 Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross’d:  
 But on this day let seamen fear no wreck;  
 No bargains break that are not this day made:  
 This day, all things begun come to ill end,  
 Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!"</span>

</div>

Again, Macbeth (iv. 1) says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">             "Let this pernicious hour  
Stand aye accursed in the calendar!"</span>

</div>

   In the old almanacs the days supposed to be favourable or

<span id="page_482">p. 482</span>

unfavourable are enumerated, allusion to which occurs in Webster's
"Duchess of Malfy," 1623—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"By the almanack, I think,  
 To choose good days and shun the critical."</span>

</div>

   At the present day this superstition still retains its hold on the
popular mind, and in the transactions of life exerts an important
influence. <span id="fr_960"></span>[1](#fn_957)\*

   *Magic*.—The system of magic which holds such a prominent place in
the "Tempest" was formerly an article in the popular creed, and as such
is frequently noticed by the writers of Shakespeare's time. Thus, in
describing Prospero, Shakespeare has given him several of the adjuncts,
beside the costume, of the popular magician, much virtue being inherent
in his very garments. So Prospero, when addressing his daughter (i. 2),
says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                      "Lend thy hand,  
And pluck my magic garment from me.—So;  
Lie there, my art."</span>

</div>

A similar importance is assigned to his staff, for he tells Ferdinand
(i. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I can here disarm thee with this stick,  
 And make thy weapon drop."</span>

</div>

And when he abjures the practice of magic, one of the requisites is "to
break his staff," and to (v. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Bury it certain fathoms in the earth."</span>

</div>

   The more immediate instruments of power were books, by means of which
spells were usually performed. Hence, in the old romances the sorcerer
is always furnished with a book, by reading certain parts of which he is
enabled to summon to his aid what demons or spirits he has occasion to
employ. When he is deprived of his book his power ceases. Malone quotes
in illustration of this notion Caliban's words in the "Tempest" (iii.
2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                       "Remember,  
First to possess his books; for without them,  
He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not  
One spirit to command."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_483">p. 483</span>

Prospero, too, declares (iii. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                "I'll to my book,  
For yet ere supper time must I perform  
Much business appertaining."</span>

</div>

And on his relinquishing his art he says that—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Deeper than did ever plummet sound  
 I'll drown my book."</span>

</div>

   Those who practice nocturnal sorcery are styled in "Troilus and
Cressida" (iv. 2), "Venomous wights."

   *Merlin's Prophecies*.—In Shakespeare's day there was an extensive
belief in strange and absurd prophecies, which were eagerly caught up
and repeated by one person to another. This form of superstition is
alluded to in "1 King Henry IV." (iii. 1), where, after Owen Glendower
has been descanting on the "omens and portents dire" which heralded his
nativity, and Hotspur's unbelieving and taunting replies to the
chieftain's assertions, the poet makes Hotspur, on Mortimer's saying,
"Fye, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!" thus reply—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I cannot choose: sometime he angers me,  
 With telling me of the moldwarp and the ant,  
 Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies;  
 And of a dragon and a finless fish," etc.</span>

</div>

   In "King Lear" (iii. 2) the fool says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">           "I'll speak a prophecy ere I go;  
            When priests are more in word than matter;  
            When brewers mar their malt with water;  
            When nobles are their tailors’ tutors;  
            No heretics burn’d, but wenches' suitors;  
            When every case in law is right;  
            No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;  
            When slanders do not live in tongues:  
            Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;  
            When usurers tell their gold i’ the field;  
            And bawds and whores do churches build;—  
            Then shall the realm of Albion  
            Come to great confusion:  
            Then comes the time, who lives to see’t,  
            That going shall be used with feet.  
This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_484">p. 484</span>

   This witty satire was probably against the prophecies attributed to
Merlin, which were then prevalent among the people. <span
id="fr_961"></span>[1](#fn_958)

   Formerly, too, prophecies of apparent impossibilities were common in
Scotland; such as the removal of one place to another. So in "Macbeth"
(iv. i), the apparition says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Macbeth shall never vanquish’d be until  
 Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill  
 Shall come against him."</span>

</div>

   *Portents and Prodigies*.—In years gone the belief in supernatural
occurrences was a common article of faith; and our ancestors made use of
every opportunity to prove the truth of this superstitious belief. The
most usual monitions of this kind were, "lamentings heard in the air;
shakings and tremblings of the earth; sudden gloom at noon-day; the
appearance of meteors; the shooting of stars; eclipses of the sun and
moon; the moon of a bloody hue; the shrieking of owls; the croaking of
ravens; the shrillings of crickets; night-howlings of dogs; the
death-watch; the chattering of pies; wild neighing of horses; blood
dropping from the nose; winding sheets; strange and fearful noises,
&c.," many of which Shakespeare has used, introducing them as the
precursors of murder, sudden death, disasters, and superhuman
events. <span id="fr_962"></span>[2](#fn_959) Thus in "King Richard II."
(ii. 4), the following prodigies are selected as the forerunners of the
death or fall of kings

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"’Tis thought the king is dead: we will not stay.  
 The bay-trees in our country are all wither’d,  
 And meteors fright the fix’d stars of heaven;  
 The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth,  
 And lean-look’d prophets whisper fearful change;  
 Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap,  
 The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,  
 The other to enjoy by rage and war:  
 These signs forerun the death or fall of kings."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_485">p. 485</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Previous to the
assassination of Julius Cæsar we are told in "Hamlet" (i. 1) how—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"In the most high and palmy state of Rome,  
 A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,  
 The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead  
 Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;  
 As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,  
 Disasters in the sun, and the moist star;  
 Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands  
 Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse."</span>

</div>

More appalling still are the circumstances which preceded and
accompanied the murder of Duncan ("Macbeth," ii. 3). We may also compare
the omens which marked the births of Owen Glendower and Richard III.
Indeed, the supposed sympathy of the elements with human joy or sorrow
or suffering is evidently a very ancient superstition; and this presumed
sensitiveness, not only of the elements, but of animated nature to the
perpetration of deeds of darkness and blood by perverted nature, has in
all ages been extensively believed. It is again beautifully illustrated
in the lines, where Shakespeare makes Lennox, on the morning following
the murder of Duncan, by his host, "Macbeth," (ii. 3), give the
following narrative:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The night has been unruly: where we lay,  
 Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,  
 Lamentings heard i’ the air; strange screams of death,  
 And prophesyings with accents terrible  
 Of dire combustion and confused events  
 New hatch’d to the woeful time: the obscure bird  
 Clamour’d the livelong night: some say, the earth  
 Was feverous and did shake."</span>

This idea is further illustrated in the dialogue, which follows, between
Ross and an old man:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Old Man*. Threescore and ten I can remember
well:  
 Within the volume of which time I have seen  
 Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night  
 Hath trifled former knowings."  
 "*Ross*.           Ah, good father,  
 Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man's act,  
 Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, ’tis day,</span>

</div>

<span id="page_486">p. 486</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small"><span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span>  And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:  
 Is’t night's predominance, or the day's shame,  
 That darkness does the face of earth entomb,  
 When living light should kiss it?"</span>

</div>

   *Supernatural authority of Kings*.—The belief in the supernatural
authority of monarchs is but a remnant of the long supposed "divine
right" of kings to govern, which resulted from a conviction that they
could trace their pedigrees back to the deities themselves. <span
id="fr_963"></span>[1](#fn_960) Thus Shakespeare even puts into the
mouth of the murderer and usurper Claudius, King of Denmark, the
following sentence:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Let him go, Gertrude: do not fear our person:  
 There's such a divinity doth hedge a king,  
 That treason can but peep to what it would,  
 Acts little of his will."</span>

</div>

This notion is by no means confined to either civilized or
semi-civilized nations. It is, says Mr Hardwick, "a universal feeling
among savage tribes." The ignorant serf of Russia believed, and indeed
yet believes, that if the deity were to die the Emperor would succeed to
his power and authority.

   *Sympathetic Indications*.—According to a very old tradition, the
wounds of a murdered person were supposed to bleed afresh at the
approach or touch of the murderer. This effect, though impossible,
remarks Nares, <span id="fr_964"></span>[2](#fn_961) except it were by
miracle, was firmly believed, and almost universally, for a very long
period. Poets, therefore, were fully justified in their use of it. Thus
Shakespeare in "King Richard III." (i. 2) makes Lady Anne, speaking of
Richard Duke of Gloster, say—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O, gentlemen, see, see! dear Henry's wounds  
 Open their congeal’d mouths and bleed afresh!  
 Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity;  
 For ’tis thy presence that exhales this blood  
 From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;  
 Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,  
 Provokes this deluge most unnatural."</span>

</div>

Stow alludes to this circumstance in his "Annals" (424). He says the
king's body "was brought to St Paul's in an

<span id="page_487">p. 487</span>

open coffin, barefaced, where he bled; thence he was carried to the
Blackfriars, and there bled." Matthew Paris also states that after Henry
the Second's death his son Richard came to view the body—"Quo
superveniente, confestim erupit sanguis ex naribus regis mortui; ac si
indignaretur spiritus in adventu ejus, qui ejusdem mortis causa esse
credebatur, ut videretur sanguis clamare ad Deum." <span
id="fr_965"></span>[1](#fn_962) In the "Athenian Oracle" (i. 106), this
supposed phenomenon is thus accounted for—"The blood is congealed in the
body for two or three days, and then becomes liquid again, in its
tendency to corruption. The air being heated by many persons coming
about the body, is the same thing to it as motion is. ’Tis observed that
dead bodies will bleed in a concourse of people when murderers are
absent, as well as present, yet legislators have thought fit to
authorise it, and use this trial as an argument, at least to frighten,
though ’tis no conclusive one to condemn them." Among other allusions to
this superstition may be mentioned one by King James in his
"Dæmonology," where we read—"In a secret murder, if the dead carkasse be
at any time thereafter handled by the murderer, it will gush out of
blood, as if the blood were crying to heaven for revenge of the
murderer." It is spoken of also in a note to Chap. V. of the "Fair Maid
of Perth," that this bleeding of a corpse was urged as an evidence of
guilt in the High Court of Justiciary at Edinburgh as late as the year
1668. An interesting survival of this curious notion exists in Durham,
where, says Mr Henderson, <span id="fr_966"></span>[2](#fn_963)
"touching of the corpse by those who come to look at it is still
expected by the poor on the part of those who come to their house while
a dead body is lying in it, in token that they wished no ill to the
departed, and were in peace and amity with him."

   We may also compare the following passage, where Macbeth (iii. 4),
speaking of the Ghost, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"It will have blood; they say, blood will have
blood;  
 Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;  
 Augures and understood relations have  
 By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth  
 The secret’st man of blood."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_488">p. 488</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Shakespeare
perhaps alludes to some story in which the stones covering the corpse of
a murdered man were said to have moved of themselves, and so revealed
the secret. The idea of trees speaking probably refers to the story of
the tree which revealed to Æneas the murder of Polydorus (Virg. "Æneid,"
iii. 22, 599). Indeed, in days gone by, this superstition was carried to
such an extent that we are told, in D’Israeli's "Curiosities Of
Literature," "by the side of the bier, if the slightest change was
observable in the eyes, the mouth, feet, or hands of the corpse, the
murderer was conjectured to be present, and many an innocent spectator
must have suffered death. This practice forms a rich picture in the
imagination of our old writers; and their histories and ballads are
laboured into pathos by dwelling on this phenomenon."
