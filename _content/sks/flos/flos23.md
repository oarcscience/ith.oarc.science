### CHAPTER XXI.

#### FISHES.

<span class="smallcaps">Although</span> it has been suggested that
Shakespeare found but little recreation in fishing, <span
id="fr_930"></span>[1](#fn_927)\* rather considering, as he makes Ursula
say in "Much Ado About Nothing" (iii. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The pleasant’st angling is to see the fish  
 Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,  
 And greedily devour the treacherous bait,"</span>

</div>

and that it would be difficult to illustrate a work on angling with
quotations from his writings," the Rev. H. N. Ellacombe, in his
interesting papers <span id="fr_931"></span>[2](#fn_928) on "Shakespeare
as an Angler," has not only shown the strong probability that he was a
lover of this sport, but further adds, that "he may be claimed as the
first English poet that wrote of angling with any freedom; and there can
be little doubt that he would not have done so if the subject had not
been very familiar to him—so familiar, that he could scarcely write
without dropping the little hints and unconscious expressions which
prove that the subject was not only familiar, but full of pleasant
memories to him." His allusions, however, to the folk-lore associated
with fishes are very few; but the two or three popular notions and
proverbial sayings which he has quoted in connection with them, help to
embellish this part of our subject.

   *Carp*.—This fish was proverbially the most cunning of fishes, and so
"Polonius's comparison of his own worldly-wise

<span id="page_467">p. 467</span>

deceit to the craft required for catching a carp," is most apt
("Hamlet," ii. I) <span id="fr_932"></span>[1](#fn_929)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                    "See you now;  
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth."</span>

</div>

This notion is founded on fact, the brain of the carp being six times as
large as the average brain of other fishes.

   *Cockle*.—The badge of a pilgrim was formerly a cockleshell, which
was worn usually in the front of the hat. "The habit," we are
told, <span id="fr_933"></span>[2](#fn_930) "being sacred, this served
as a protection, and therefore was often assumed as a disguise." The
escalop was sometimes used, and either of them was considered as an
emblem of the pilgrim's intention to go beyond the sea. Thus in
Ophelia's Ballad ("Hamlet," iv. 5, song), the lover is to be known:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"By his cockle hat and staff,  
 And his sandal shoon."</span>

</div>

In Peele's "Old Wives’ Tale," 1595, we read, "I will give thee a
palmer's staff of ivory, and a scallop shell of beaten gold." Nares,
too, quotes from Green's "Never too Late," an account of the pilgrim's
dress:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A hat of straw, like to a swain,  
 Shelter for the sun and rain,  
 With a scallop shell before."</span>

</div>

   *Cuttle*.—A foul-mouthed fellow was so called, says Mr
Halliwell-Phillipps, <span id="fr_934"></span>[3](#fn_931) because this
fish is said to throw out of its mouth, upon certain occasions, an inky
and black juice that fouls the water; and as an illustration of its use
in this sense, he quotes Doll Tearsheet's words to Pistol, "2 Henry IV."
(ii. 4):—"By this wine, I'll thrust my knife in your mouldy chaps, an
you play the saucy cuttle with me." Dyce says that the context would
seem to imply that the term is equivalent to "culter, swaggerer,
bully." <span id="fr_935"></span>[4](#fn_932)

   *Gudgeon*.—This being the bait for many of the larger fish, "to
swallow a gudgeon," was sometimes used for to be caught or deceived.
More commonly, however, the allusion

<span id="page_468">p. 468</span>

is to the easiness with which the gudgeon itself is caught, as in the
"Merchant of Venice" (i. 1), where Gratiano says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"But fish not, with this melancholy bait,  
 For this fool gudgeon."</span>

</div>

   *Gurnet*.—The phrase "soused gurnet" was formerly a well-known term
of approach, in allusion to which Falstaff, in "1 Henry IV." (iv. 2),
says, "If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused gurnet." The
gurnet, of which there are several species, was probably thought a very
bad and vulgar dish when soused or pickled.

   *Loach*.—A small fish, known also as "the groundling." The allusion
to it by one of the Carriers, in "1 Henry IV." (ii. 1), who says, "Your
chamber-lie breeds fleas like a Loach," has much puzzled the
commentators. It appears, however, from a passage in Holland's
translation of Pliny's "Natural History" (B. ix. c. xlvii), that
anciently fishes were supposed to be infested with fleas:—"Last of all
some fishes there be which of themselves are given to breed fleas and
lice; among which the chalcis, a kind of turgot, is one." Malone
suggests that the passage may mean, "breeds fleas as fast as a Loach
breeds loaches;" this fish being reckoned a peculiarly prolific fish. It
seems probable, however, that the Carrier alludes to one of those
fanciful notions as make up a great part of the natural history among
the common people. <span id="fr_936"></span>[1](#fn_933) At the present
day there is a fisherman's fancy on the Norfolk coast that fish and
fleas come together. "Lawk, sir!" said an old fellow, near Cromer, to a
correspondent of "Notes and Queries" (Oct. 7th, 1865), "times is as you
may look in my flannel-shirt, and scarce see a flea, and then there
ain't but a very few herrins; but times that ’ll be right alive with
’em, and then there's sartin to be a sight o’ fish."

   Mr Houghton, writing in the "Academy" (May 27th, 1882), thinks that
in the above passage the small river Loach (cobitis barbatula), is the
fish intended. He says, "at certain times of the year, chiefly during
the summer months, almost all fresh-water fish are liable to be infested
with some kind of Epizoa. There are two kinds of parasitic creatures

<span id="page_469">p. 469</span>

which are most commonly seen on various fish caught in the rivers and
ponds of this country; and these are the "Argulus foliaceus," a
crustacean, and the "Piscicola piscium," a small cylindrical kind of
leech."

   *Mermaids*.—From the earliest ages mermaids have had a legendary
existence—the syrens of the ancients evidently belonging to the same
remarkable family. The orthodox mermaid is half woman half fish—the
fishy half being sometimes depicted as doubly-tailed. Shakespeare
frequently makes his characters talk about mermaids, as in the "Comedy
of Errors" (iii. 2), where Antipholus of Syracuse says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,  
   To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears;  
 Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote.  
   Spread o’er the silver waves thy golden hairs,  
 And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,  
   And in that glorious supposition think  
 He gains by death that hath such means to die."</span>

</div>

And again, further on he adds—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I'll stop my ears against the mermaid's
song."</span>

</div>

   Staunton considers that in these passages the allusion is obviously
to the long-current opinion that the syren, or mermaid, decoyed mortals
to destruction by the witchery of her songs. This superstition has been
charmingly illustrated by Leyden, in his poem, "The Mermaid" (see
Scott's "Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border," iv. 294)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Thus, all to soothe the chieftain's woe,  
 Far from the maid he loved so dear,  
 The song arose, so soft and slow,  
 He seem’d her prating sigh to hear.  
   \*       \*       \*       \*       \*

 That sea-maid's form of pearly light,  
 Was whiter than the downy spray,  
 And round her bosom, heaving bright,  
 Her glossy, yellow ringlets play.

 Borne on a foaming crested wave  
 She reached amain the bounding prow,  
 Then clasping fast the [chieftain](errata.htm#10) brave,  
 She, plunging, sought the deep below."

</div>

<span id="page_470">p. 470</span>

   This tradition gave rise to a curious custom in the Isle of Man,
which, in Waldron's time, was observed on the 24th December, though
afterwards on St Stephen's Day. It is said that, once upon a time, a
fairy of uncommon beauty exerted such undue influence over the male
population that she induced, by the enchantment of her sweet voice,
numbers to follow her footsteps, till by degrees she led them into the
sea, where they perished. This barbarous exercise of power had continued
for a great length of time, till it was apprehended that the island
would be exhausted of its defenders. Fortunately, however, a
knight-errant sprang up, who discovered a means of counteracting the
charms used by this syren—even laying a plot for her destruction, which
she only escaped by taking the form of a wren. Although she evaded
instant annihilation, a spell was cast upon her, by which she was
condemned, on every succeeding New Year's Day, to reanimate the same
form, with the definite sentence that she must ultimately perish by
human hand. Hence, on the specified anniversary, every effort was made
to extirpate the fairy; and the poor wrens were pursued, pelted, fired
at, and destroyed without mercy, their feathers being preserved as a
charm against shipwreck for one year. At the present day there is no
particular time for pursuing the wren; it is captured by boys alone, who
keep up the old custom chiefly for amusement. On St Stephen's Day, a
band of boys go from door to door with a wren suspended by the legs, in
the centre of two hoops crossing each other at right angles, decorated
with evergreens and ribbons, singing lines called "Hunt the Wren." <span
id="fr_937"></span>[1](#fn_934)

   In the "Midsummer Night's Dream" (ii. 1), Oberon speaks of heaving "a
mermaid on a dolphin's back;" and in "Hamlet," the queen referring to
Ophelia's death, says (iv. 7)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                  "Her clothes spread wide;  
And, mermaid-like, a while they bore her up."</span>

</div>

   In two other passages Shakespeare alludes to this legendary creature.
Thus in "3 Henry VI." (iii. 2) Gloucester boasts that he will "drown
more sailors than the mermaid

<span id="page_471">p. 471</span>

shall;" and in "Antony and Cleopatra" (ii. 2) Enobarbus relates how—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,  
 So many mermaids, tended her i’ the eyes,  
 And made their bends adornings: at the helm  
 A seeming mermaid steers."</span>

</div>

   In all these cases Shakespeare, <span id="fr_938"></span>[1](#fn_935)
as was his wont, made his characters say what they were likely to think,
in their several positions and periods of life. It has been
suggested, <span id="fr_939"></span>[2](#fn_936) however, that the idea
of the mermaid, in some of the passages just quoted, seems more
applicable to the syren, especially in the "Midsummer's Night's Dream,"
where the "mermaid on a dolphin's back" could not easily have been so
placed, had she had a fish-like tail instead of legs.

Notices of mermaids are scattered abundantly in books of bygone times.
Mermen and mermaids, men of the sea, and women of the sea, having been
as "stoutly believed in as the great sea-serpent, and on very much the
same kind of evidence." Holinshed gives a detailed account of a merman
caught at Oxford, in Suffolk, in the reign of King John. He was kept
alive on raw meal and fish for six months, but at last "gledde
secretelye to the sea, and was neuer after seene nor heard off." Even in
modern times we are told how every now and then a mermaid has made her
appearance. Thus, in the "General Magazine" (Jan. 1747), we read—"It is
reported from the north of Scotland that some time this month a sea
creature, known by the name of mermaid, which has the shape of a human
body from the trunk upwards, but below is wholly fish, was carried some
miles up the water of Devron." In 1824, <span
id="fr_940"></span>[3](#fn_937) a mermaid or merman made its appearance,
when, as the papers of that day inform us, "upwards of 150 distinguished
fashionables" went to see it.

The sign of the "Mermaid" was a famous tavern, situated in Bread Street.
As early as the fifteenth century, we are

<span id="page_472">p. 472</span>

told, it was one of the haunts of the pleasure-seeking Sir John Howard,
whose trusty steward records, anno 1464:—"Paid for wyn at the Mermayd in
Bred Street, for my mastyr and Syr Nicholas Latimer, xd. ob." In 2603
Sir Walter Raleigh established a Literary Club in this house, amongst
its members being Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher,
Selden, Carew, Martin, Doune, &c. It is often alluded to by Beaumont and
Fletcher.

   *Minnow*.—This little fish, from its insignificant character, is used
by "Coriolanus" (iii. 1), as a term of contempt, "Hear you this Triton
of the minnows?" and again in "Love's Labour's Lost" (i. 1, letter), it
occurs, "that base minnow of thy mirth."

   *Pike*.—An old name for this fish was *luce*. In the "Merry Wives of
Windsor" (i. 1), we are told that—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The luce is the fresh fish."</span>

</div>

There can be no doubt, too, that there is in this passage an allusion to
the armorial bearings of Shakespeare's old enemy, Sir Thomas Lucy.
Amongst the various instances of the use of this term we may quote Isaac
Walton, who says" The mighty luce or pike is taken to be the tyrant, as
the salmon is the king of the fresh waters." Stow, in his "Survey of
London," describes a procession of the Fishmongers’ Company in 1298, as
having horses painted like *sea-luce*—"Then four salmons of silver on
foure horses, and after them sixe and fortie armed knightes riding on
horses made like *luces of the sea*."

   *Porpoise*.—According to sailors the playing of porpoises round a
ship is a certain prognostic of a violent gale of wind; hence the
allusion in "Pericles" (ii. 1), where one of the fishermen says,
speaking of the storm—"Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw the
porpus how he bounced and tumbled?" Thus, too, in the "Canterbury
Guests, or a Bargain Broken," by Ravenscroft, we read—"My heart begins
to leap and play, like a porpice before a storm." And a further
reference occurs in Wilsford's "Nature's Secrets"—"Porpoises, or
sea-hogs, when observed to sport and chase one another about ships,
expect then some stormy weather."

<span id="page_473">p. 473</span>

   *Sea-monster*.—The reference in "King Lear" (i. 4), to the
"sea-monster:"—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,  
 More hideous when thou show’st thee in a child  
 Than the sea-monster"—</span>

</div>

is generally supposed to be the hippopotamus, which, according to Upton,
was the hieroglyphical symbol of impiety and ingratitude. <span
id="fr_941"></span>[1](#fn_938) Sandys <span
id="fr_942"></span>[2](#fn_939) gives a picture said to be portrayed in
the porch of the temple of Minerva at Sais, in which is the figure of a
river horse, denoting "murder, impudence, violence, and injustice; for
they say that he killeth his sire and ravisheth his own dam." His
account is no doubt taken from Plutarch's "Isis and Osiris;" and
Shakespeare may have read it in Holland's translation (p. 1300), <span
id="fr_943"></span>[3](#fn_940)\* but why he should call the river horse
a "sea-monster" is not very clear. It is more likely, however, that the
whale is meant.
