### CHAPTER XXIII.

#### MISCELLANEOUS CUSTOMS, ETC.

*<span class="smallcaps">Badge</span> of Poverty*.—In the reign of
William III., those who received parish relief had to wear a badge. It
was the letter P, with the initial of the parish to which they belonged,
in red or blue cloth, on the shoulder of the right sleeve. In "2 Henry
VI." (v. 1), Clifford says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Might I but know thee by thy household
badge."</span>

</div>

   *Bedfellow*.—A proof of the simplicity of manners in olden times is
evidenced by the fact, that it was customary for men, even of the
highest rank, to sleep together. In "Henry V." (ii. 2), Exeter says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,  
 Whom he hath dull’d and cloy’d with gracious favours."</span>

</div>

"This unseemly custom," says Malone, "continued common till the middle
of the last century, if not later." Beaumont and Fletcher, in the
"Coxcomb" (i. 1), thus refer to it—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Must we that have so long time been as one,  
 Seen cities, countries, kingdoms, and their wonders,  
 Been bedfellows, and in our various journey  
 Mixt all our observations," &c.</span>

</div>

In the same way letters from noblemen to each other often began with the
appellation *bedfellow*. <span id="fr_967"></span>[1](#fn_964)

   *The Curfew Bell*, which is generally supposed to be of Norman
origin, is still rung in some of our old country villages, although it
has long lost its significance. It seems to have been as important to
ghosts as to living men; it being their signal for walking, a licence
which apparently lasted till the first cock. Fairies, too, and other
spirits were

<span id="page_490">p. 490</span>

under the same regulations; and hence Prospero, in the "Tempest" (v. 1),
says of his elves, that they

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                         "Rejoice  
To hear the solemn curfew."</span>

</div>

In "King Lear" (iii. 4), we find the fiend Flibbertigibbet obeying the
same rule, for Edgar says—"This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet; he
begins at curfew, and walks till the first cock."

   In "Measure for Measure" (iv. 2), we find another allusion—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Duke*. The best and wholesomest spirits of the
night  
 Envelope you, good Provost! who call’d here of late?  
 *Prov*. None, since the curfew rung."</span>

</div>

And once more in "Romeo and Juliet" (iv. 4), Capulet says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath
crow’d,  
 The curfew bell hath rung, ’tis three o'clock." <span
id="fr_968"></span>[1](#fn_965)</span>

</div>

   *Sacring Bell*.—This was a bell which rang for processions and other
holy ceremonies. <span id="fr_969"></span>[2](#fn_966) It is mentioned
in "Henry VIII." (iii. 2), by the Earl of Surrey—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                   "I'll startle you  
Worse than the sacring bell."</span>

</div>

It is rung in the Romish Church to give notice that the "Host" is
approaching, and is now called "Sanctus bell," from the words "Sanctus,
sanctus, sanctus, dominus, Deus, Sabaoth," pronounced by the priest.

   On the graphic passage (ii. 1), where Macbeth says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">               "The bell invites me,  
Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell  
That summons thee to heaven or to hell."</span>

</div>

   Malone has this note—"Thus Raleigh speaking of love, in England's
'Helicon' (1600)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"'It is perhaps that sauncing bell,  
 That toules all into heaven or hell.'</span>

</div>

<span id="page_491">p. 491</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Sauncing* being
probably a mistake for sacring or saint's bell, originally, perhaps,
written saintis bell." In "Hudibras" we find—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The old saintis bell that rings all in."</span>

</div>

   *Carpet-knights*.—These were knights dubbed at court by mere favour,
and not on the field of battle for their military exploits. In "Twelfth
Night" (iii. 4), Sir Toby defines one of them thus—"He is knight, dubbed
with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration."

   A "trencher knight" was probably synonymous, as in "Love's Labour's
Lost" (v. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Some mumbles-news, some trencher-knight, some
Dick."</span>

</div>

These carpet-knights were sometimes called "knights of the green
cloth." <span id="fr_970"></span>[1](#fn_967)

   *Chair Days*.—Days of old age and infirmity. So, in "2 Henry VI." (v.
2), young Clifford, on seeing his dead father, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                   "Wast thou ordain’d, dear
father,  
To close thy youth in peace, and to achieve  
The silver livery of advised age,  
And in thy reverence, and thy chair days, thus  
To die in ruffian battle."</span>

</div>

   *Chivalry*.—The expression "sworn brothers," which Shakespeare
several times employs, refers to the "fratres jurati," who in the days
of chivalry mutually bound themselves by oath to share each other's
fortune. Thus, Falstaff says of Shallow in "2 Henry IV." (iii. 2)—"He
talks as familiarly of John a Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to
him." In "Henry V." (ii. 1), Bardolph says, "We'll be all three sworn
brothers to France." In course of time it was used in a laxer sense to
denote intimacy, as in "Much Ado About Nothing" (i. 1), where Beatrice
says of Benedick, that "he hath every month a new sworn brother." <span
id="fr_971"></span>[2](#fn_968)

<span id="page_492">p. 492</span>

   According to the laws of chivalry, a person of superior birth might
not be challenged by an inferior, or if challenged might refuse combat,
a reference to which seems to be made by Cleopatra ("Antony and
Cleopatra," ii. 5)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                  "I will not hurt him.  
These hands do lack nobility, that they strike  
A meaner than myself."</span>

</div>

Again, in "Troilus and Cressida" (v. 5), the same practice is alluded to
by Hector, who asks Thersites—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"What art thou, Greek? art thou for Hector's
match?  
 Art thou of blood and honour?"</span>

</div>

   Singer quotes from "Melville's Memoirs" (1735, p. 165):—"The laird of
Grange offered to fight Bothwell, who answered that he was not his
equal. The like answer made he to Tullibardine. Then my lord Lindsay
offered to fight him, which he could not well refuse; but his heart
failed him, and he grew cold on the business." <span
id="fr_972"></span>[1](#fn_969)\*

   *Clubs*.—According to Malone, it was once a common custom, on the
breaking out of a fray, to call out "Clubs, clubs!" to part the
combatants. Thus, in "1 Henry VI." (i. 3), the Mayor declares—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I'll call for clubs, if you will not away."</span>

</div>

In "Titus Andronicus" (ii. 1), Aaron says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Clubs, clubs! these lovers will not keep the
peace."</span>

</div>

   “Clubs,” too, “was originally the popular cry to call forth the
London apprentices, who employed their clubs for the preservation of the
public peace. Sometimes, however, they used those weapons to raise a
disturbance, as they are described doing in the following passage in
"Henry VIII." (v. 4), “I missed the meteor once, and hit that woman; who
cried out 'Clubs!' when I might see from far some forty truncheoners
draw to her succour, which were the hope o’ the Strand, where she was
quartered.”

<span id="page_493">p. 493</span>

   *Colour-Lore*.—Green eyes have been praised by poets of nearly every
land, <span id="fr_973"></span>[1](#fn_970) and according to Armado, in
"Love's Labour's Lost" (i. 2), "Green indeed is the colour of lovers."

   In "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (v. 1). Thisbe laments:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Lovers, make moan:  
 His eyes were green as leeks."</span>

</div>

The Nurse, in her description of Romeo's rival ("Romeo and Juliet," iii.
5), says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                   "An eagle, madam,  
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye  
As Paris hath."</span>

</div>

In the "Two Noble Kinsmen" (v. 1), Emilia, praying to Diana, says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                  "O vouchsafe,  
With that thy rare green eye, which never yet  
Beheld things maculate—look on thy virgin."</span>

</div>

The words of Armado have been variously explained as alluding to green
eyes—Spanish writers being peculiarly enthusiastic in this praise—to the
willow worn by unsuccessful lovers, and to their melancholy. <span
id="fr_974"></span>[2](#fn_971) It has also been suggested <span
id="fr_975"></span>[3](#fn_972) that as green is the colour most
suggestive of freshness and spring-time, it may have been considered the
most appropriate lover's badge. At the same time, however, it is
curious, that as green has been regarded as an ominous colour it should
be connected with lovers for, as an old couplet remarks:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Those dressed in blue  
 Have lovers true;  
 In green and white,  
 Forsaken quite." <span id="fr_976"></span>[4](#fn_973)</span>

</div>

In "Merchant of Venice" (iii. 2), "Green-eyed jealousy;" and in
"Othello" (iii. 3), its equivalent "Green-eyed monster," are expressions
used by Shakespeare.

   *Yellow* is an epithet often, too, applied to jealousy by the old
writers. In the "Merry Wives of Windsor" (i. 3), Nym

<span id="page_494">p. 494</span>

says he will possess Ford "with yellowness." In "Much ado about Nothing"
(ii. 1), Beatrice describes the Count as "Civil as an orange, and
something of that jealous complexion." In "Twelfth Night" (ii. 4),
Violet tells the Duke how her father's daughter loved a man, but never
told her love:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">             "She pined in thought,  
And with a green and yellow melancholy  
She sat like patience on a monument."</span>

</div>

   *Dinner Customs*.—In days gone there was but one saltcellar on the
dinner table, which was a large piece of plate generally much
ornamented. The tables being long, the salt was commonly placed about
the middle, and served as a kind of boundary to the different quality of
the guests invited. Those of distinction were ranked above; the space
below being assigned to the dependents, inferior relations of the master
of the house, etc. <span id="fr_977"></span>[1](#fn_974) Shakespeare
would seem to allude to this custom in the "Winter's Tale" (i. 2), where
Leontes says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                     "Lower messes  
Perchance are to this business purblind?"</span>

</div>

Upon which passage Steevens adds, "Leontes comprehends inferiority of
understanding in the idea of inferiority of rank." Ben Jonson, speaking
of the characteristics of an insolent coxcomb, remarks;—"His fashion is
not to take knowledge of him that is beneath him in clothes. He never
drinks below the salt."

   *Ordinary*.—This was a public dinner, where each paid his share, an
allusion to which custom is made by Enobarbus in "Antony and Cleopatra"
(ii. 2), who speaking of Antony says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Being barber’d ten times o’er, goes to the feast,  
 And for his ordinary pays his heart  
 For what his eyes eat only."</span>

</div>

Again, in "All's Well that ends Well" (ii. 3), Lafeu says:—"I did think
thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty wise fellow; thou did’st make
tolerable vent of thy travel."

   The "ordinary" also denoted the lounging place of the men

<span id="page_495">p. 495</span>

of the town, and the fantastic gallants who herded together. They were,
says the author of "Curiosities of Literature" (iii. p. 82), "the
exchange for news, the echoing places for all sorts of town talk; there
they might hear of the last new play and poem, and the last fresh widow
sighing for some knight to make her a lady; these resorts were attended
also to save charges of house-keeping."

   *Drinking Customs*.—Shakespeare has given several allusions to the
old customs associated with drinking, which have always varied in
different countries. At the present day many of the drinking customs
still observed are very curious, especially those kept up at the
Universities and Inns of Court. <span id="fr_978"></span>[1](#fn_975)\*

   *Alms-drink* was a phrase in use, says Warburton, amongst good
fellows, to signify that liquor of another's share which his companion
drank to ease him. So in "Antony and Cleopatra" (ii. 7), one of the
servants of Lepidus says:—"They have made him drink alms-drink."

   *By-drinkings*.—This was a phrase for drinkings between meals;. and
is used by the Hostess in "1 Henry IV." (iii. 3), who says to
Falstaff:—"You owe money here besides, Sir John, for your diet and
by-drinkings."

   *Hooped Pots*.—In olden times drinking pots were made with hoops, so
that when two or more drank from the same tankard, no one should drink
more than his share. There were generally three hoops to the pots,
hence, in "2 King Henry VI." (iv. 2), Cade says—"The three-hooped pot
shall have ten hoops." In Nash's "Pierce Pennilesse" we read:—"I believe
hoopes on quart pots were invented that every man should take his hoope,
and no more."

   The phrases "to do a man right," and "to do him reason," were in
years gone by the common expressions in pledging healths; he who drank a
bumper, expected that a bumper should be drunk to his toast. To this
practice alludes the scrap of a song which Silence sings in "2 Henry
IV." (v 3)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Do me right,  
 And dub me knight:  
     Samingo."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_496">p. 496</span>

   He who drank, too, a bumper on his knee to the health of his
mistress, was dubbed a knight for the evening. The word Samingo is
either a corruption of, or an intended blunder for San Domingo, but why
this saint should be the patron of topers is uncertain.

   *Rouse*.—According to Gifford, <span id="fr_979"></span>[1](#fn_976)
a rouse was a large glass in which a health was given, the drinking of
which, by the rest of the company, formed a carouse. Hamlet (i. 4) says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The king doth wake to-night and takes his
rouse."</span>

</div>

The word occurs again in the following Act (i.), where Polonius uses the
phrase, "o’ertook in’s rouse;" and in the sense of a bumper, or glass of
liquor in "Othello" (ii. 3), "they have given me a rouse already."

   *Sheer Ale*.—This term which occurs in the "Taming of the Shrew"
(Ind. 2) by Sly:—"Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale wife of Wincot, if she
know me not: if she say I am not fourteen-pence on the score for sheer
ale," etc.; according to some expositors, means "ale alone, nothing but
ale," rather than "unmixed ale.''

   *Sneak Cup*.—This phrase, which is used by Falstaff in "1 Henry IV."
(iii. 3):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The prince is a jack, a sneak-cup,"</span>

</div>

was used to denote one who balked his glass.

   *Earnest Money*.—It was in olden times customary to ratify an
agreement by a bent coin. In "Henry VIII." (ii. 3), the old lady
remarks:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">’Tis strange: a three-pence bow’d would hire me,  
 Old as I am, to queen it."</span>

</div>

   There were, however, no threepences so early as the reign of Henry
VIII.

   *Exclamations*.—"Charity for the Lord's sake," was the form of
ejaculatory supplication used by imprisoned debtors to the passers
by. <span id="fr_980"></span>[2](#fn_977)\* So, in Davies’ "Epigrams"
(1611):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Good, gentle writers, 'for the Lord's sake, for the
Lord's sake,'  
 Like Ludgate prisoner, lo, I begging make  
 My mone."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_497">p. 497</span>

   In "Measure for Measure" (iv. 3), the phrase is alluded to by Pompey.
"All great doers in our trade, and are now for the Lord's sake."

   "Cry Budget."—A watchword. Thus Slender says to Shallow in the "Merry
Wives of Windsor" (v. 2):—"We have a nay-word how to know one another: I
come to her in white, and cry 'mum;' she cries 'budget;' and by that we
know one another."

   "God save the mark."—"Romeo and Juliet" (iii. 2). This exclamation
has hitherto baffled the research of every commentator. It occurs again
in "1 Henry IV." (i. 3); and in the "Merchant of Venice" (ii. 2); and in
"Othello" (i. 1), we have "God help the mark." In the quarto, 1597,
instead of "God save the mark" in the first passage quoted, we have "God
save the sample," an expression equally obscure. <span
id="fr_981"></span>[1](#fn_978)

   *Halidom*.—This exclamation was used, says Minsheu, <span
id="fr_982"></span>[2](#fn_979) by old countrymen, by manner of
swearing. In "Two Gentlemen of Verona" (iv. 2), the hostess says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"By my halidom, I was fast asleep."</span>

</div>

the probable derivation being *holy*, with the termination *dome*.

   *Hall! Hall!*—An exclamation formerly used, to make a clear space in
a crowd for any particular purpose, was "a hall, a hall." So in "Romeo
and Juliet" (i. 5), Capulet says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                "Come, musicians, play,  
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls."</span>

</div>

   *Hay*.—This is equivalent to "you have it," an exclamation in
fencing, when a thrust or hit is received by the antagonist. In "Romeo
and Juliet" (ii. 4), Mercutio speaks of "the punto reverso! the hai!"

   *Hold*—To cry *hold!* when persons were fighting, was an
authoritative way of separating them according to the old military law.
So Macbeth in his struggle with Macduff:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And damn’d be him that first cries, Hold,
enough!"</span>

</div>

<span id="page_498">p. 498</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> We may compare
Lady Macbeth's words (i. 5):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Nor heaven peeps through the blanket of the dark,  
 To cry, Hold, hold!"</span>

</div>

   "I’ the name of evil."—A vulgar exclamation formerly in use. So in
the "Winter's Tale" (iv. 2), it is used by the Clown.

   *"O ho, o ho!"*—This savage exclamation was, says Steevens,
constantly appropriated by the writers of our ancient mysteries and
moralities to the devil. In the "Tempest" (i. 2), Caliban, when rebuked
by Prospero for seeking "to violate the honour of my child," replies:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O ho, O ho! would’t had been done!  
 Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else  
 This isle with Calibans."</span>

</div>

   *Push*.—A exclamation equivalent to *pish*. <span
id="fr_983"></span>[1](#fn_980) It is used by Leonato in "Much ado about
Nothing" (v. 1):—"And made a push at chance and sufferance;" and again
in "Timon of Athens" (iii. 6), where one of the Lords says:—"Push! did
you see my cap?"

   *Rivo* was an exclamation often used in Bacchanalian revels, but its
origin is uncertain. It occurs in "1 Henry IV." (ii. 4)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"'Rivo!' says the drunkard."</span>

</div>

Gifford suggests that it is "corrupted, perhaps, from the Spanish *rio*,
which is figuratively used for a large quantity of liquor," a
derivation, however, which Mr Dyce does not think probable.

   *Snick-up*.—This was an exclamation of contempt, equivalent to "go
and hang yourself." <span id="fr_984"></span>[2](#fn_981) It is used by
Sir Toby in "Twelfth Night" (ii. 3), in reply to Malvolio's rebuke:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"We did keep time, sir, in our catches, sneck
up!"</span>

</div>

   *So-ho*.—This is the cry of sportsmen when the hare is found in her
seat.

<span id="page_499">p. 499</span>

   *Spy*.—"I spy," is the usual exclamation at a well-known childish
game called "Hie spy, hie?" <span id="fr_985"></span>[1](#fn_982)

   *Tailor*.—Johnson explains the following words of Puck in "A
Midsummer Night's Dream" (ii. 1), thus:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,  
 Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;  
 Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,  
 And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough."</span>

</div>

   "The custom of crying tailor at a sudden fall backwards, I think I
remember to have observed. He that slips beside his chair, falls as a
tailor squats upon his board." Mr Dyce, <span
id="fr_986"></span>[2](#fn_983) however, adds, "it may be doubted if
this explains the text."

   *Tilly-vally*.—An exclamation of contempt, the etymology of which is
uncertain. According to Douce it is a hunting phrase borrowed from the
French. Singer says it is equivalent to *fiddle-faddle*. It occurs in
"Twelfth Night" (ii. 3), being used by Sir Toby:—"Am not I
consanguineous? am I not of her blood? Tilly vally, Lady!"

   In "2 Henry IV." (ii. 4), the hostess corrupts it to
*tilly-fally:*—"Tilly-fally, Sir John, ne’er tell me: your ancient
swaggerer comes not in my doors."

   As a further illustration of the use of this word, Singer quotes a
conversation between Sir Thomas More and his wife, given in Roper's
Life:—"Is not this house, quoth he, as nigh heaven as my own? To whom
she, after her accustomed homely fashion, not liking such talk,
answered, Tylle-valle, Tylle-valle."

   *Westward-ho*.—This was one of the exclamations of the watermen who
plied on the Thames, and is used by Viola in "Twelfth Night" (iii. 1).
Dyce <span id="fr_987"></span>[3](#fn_984) quotes from Peel's "Edward
I.," to illustrate the use of this word:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Q. Elinor*. Ay, good woman, conduct me to the
court,  
 That there I may bewail my sinful life,  
 And call to God to save my wretched soul.  
                 A cry of 'Westward, ho!'  
 Woman, what noise is this I hear?  
 *Potter's Wife*. An like your grace, it is the watermen that call for
passengers to go westward now."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_500">p. 500</span>

   Decker took the exclamation, "Westward, ho!" for the title of a
comedy; and Jonson, Chapman, and Marston adopted that of "Eastward, ho!"
for one jointly written by them a few years afterwards.

   *Fools*.—Mr Douce in his essay "On the Clowns and Fools of
Shakespeare," has made a ninefold division of English fools, according
to quality or place of employment, as the domestic fool, the city or
corporation fool, the tavern fool, the fool of the mysteries and
moralities. The last is generally called the "vice," and is the original
of the stage clowns so common among the dramatists of the time of
Elizabeth, and who embody so much of the wit of Shakespeare.

   A very palpable distinction is that which distinguishes between such
creatures as were chosen to excite to laughter from some deformity of
mind or body, and such as were chosen for a certain alertness of mind
and power of repartee—or briefly, butts and wits. The dress of the
regular court fool of the middle ages was not altogether a rigid
uniform, but seems to have changed from time to time. The head was
shaved, the coat was motley, and the breeches tight, with, generally,
one leg different in colour from the other. The head was covered with a
garment resembling a monk's cowl, which fell over the breast and
shoulders, and often bore asses' ears, and was crested with a coxcomb,
while bells hung from various parts of the attire. The fool's bauble was
a short staff bearing a ridiculous head, to which was sometimes attached
an inflated bladder, by which sham castigations were inflicted; a long
petticoat was also occasionally worn, but seems to have belonged rather
to the idiots than the wits. The fool's business was to amuse his
master, to excite his laughter by sharp contrast, to prevent the over
oppression of state affairs, and, in harmony with a well-known
physiological precept, by his liveliness at meals to assist his lord's
digestion. <span id="fr_988"></span>[1](#fn_985)

   The custom of shaving and nicking the head of a fool is very old.
There is a penalty of ten shillings, in one of Alfred's Ecclesiastical
Laws, if one opprobriously shave a

<span id="page_501">p. 501</span>

common man like a fool; and Malone cites a passage from "The Choice of
Change," &c., by S. R. Gent, 4to, 1598—"Three things used by monks,
which provoke other men to laugh at their follies: 1. They are shaven
and notched on the head like fooles." <span
id="fr_989"></span>[1](#fn_986)\*

   In the "Comedy of Errors" (v. 1), the servants says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"My master preaches patience to him and the while  
 His man, with scissors nicks him like a fool," &c.</span>

</div>

   *Forfeits*.—In order to enforce some kind of regularity in barbers’
shops, which were once places of great resort for the idle, certain laws
were usually made, the breaking of which was to be punished by forfeits.
Rules of this kind, however, were as often laughed at as obeyed. So in
"Measure for Measure" (ii. 2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                    "Laws for all faults,  
But calls so countenanc’d, that the strong statutes  
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,  
As much in mock and mark.</span>

</div>

   *Gambling*.—It was once customary for a person when going abroad "to
put out" a sum of money on condition of receiving good interest for it
on his return home; if he never returned the deposit was forfeited.
Hence such a one was called "a putter out." It is to this practice that
reference is made in the following passage ("Tempest," iii. 3):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                     "Or that there were such men  
Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find  
Each putter out of five for one will bring us  
God warrant of."</span>

</div>

   Malone quotes from Moryson's "Itinerary" (1617, pt. i. 198), who
says:—"This custom of giving out money upon these adventures was first
used in court and noblemen;" a practice which "bankerouts,
stage-players, and men of base condition had drawn into contempt," by
undertaking journeys merely for gain upon their return. In Ben Jonson's
"Every Man Out of his Humour" (ii. 3), the custom is thus alluded to:—"I
do intend, this year of jubilee coming on, to travel; and because I will
not altogether go upon expence, I am determined to put forth some five
thousand pound, to be paid me *five* 

<span id="page_502">p. 502</span>

*for one*, upon the return of my wife, myself, and my dog, from the
Turk's court at Constantinople. If all, or either of us, miscarry in the
journey, ’tis gone; if we be successful, why then there will be five and
twenty thousand pound to entertain time with."

   *Garters*.—It was the regular amorous etiquette in the reign of
Elizabeth, <span id="fr_990"></span>[1](#fn_987) "for a man, professing
himself deeply in love, to assume certain outward marks of negligence in
his dress, as if too much occupied by his passion to attend to such
trifles, or driven by despondency to a forgetfulness of all outward
appearance." His "garters, in particular, were not to be tied up." In
"As You Like It" (iii. 2), this custom is described by Rosalind, who
tells Orlando:—"There is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me
how to know a man in love; . . . . your hose should be ungartered, your
bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and
everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation." Another
fashion which seems to have been common among the beaux of Queen
Elizabeth's reign, was that of wearing garters across about the knees,
an allusion to which we find in "Twelfth Night" (ii. 5), in the letter
which Malvolio reads:—"Remember who commended thy yellow stockings, and
wished to see thee ever cross-gartered." Douce quotes from the old
comedy of "The Two Angrie Women of Abingdon" (1599), where a servingman
is thus described:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Hee's a fine neate fellow,  
A spruce slave, I warrant ye, he’ele have  
His cruell garters crosse about the knee."</span>

</div>

   In days gone by, when garters were worn in sight, the upper classes
wore very expensive ones, but the lower orders worsted galloon ones.
Prince Henry calls Poins ("1 Henry IV.," ii. 4), a "caddice garter,"
meaning a man of mean rank.

   *Gaudy Days*.—Feast-days in the Colleges of our Universities are so
called, as they were formerly at the Inns of Court. In "Antony and
Cleopatra" (iii. i3), Antony says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                                     "Come,  
Let's have one other gaudy night, call to me,  
All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;  
Let's mock the midnight bell."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_503">p. 503</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They were so
called, says Blount, "from *gaudium*, because, to say truth, they are
days of joy, as bringing good cheer to the hungry students."

   *Glove*.—As an article of dress the glove held a conspicuous place in
many of our old customs and ceremonies. Thus, it was often worn in the
hat as a favour and as a mark to be challenged by an enemy, as is
illustrated by the following dialogue in "Henry V." (iv. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*King Henry*. Give me any gage of thine, and I will
wear it in my bonnet: then, if thou darest acknowledge it, I will make
it my quarrel.  
 *Will*. Here's my glove, give me another of thine.  
 *K. H*. There.  
 *Will*. This will I also wear in my cap; if ever thou come to me and
say, after to-morrow, 'This is my glove,' by this hand I will take thee
a box on the ear.  
 *K. H*. If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.  
 *Will*. Thou darest well be hanged."</span>

</div>

Again, in "Troilus and Cressida" (v. 2), Diomede, taking the glove from
Cressida, says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,  
 And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it."</span>

</div>

And in "Richard II." (v. 3), Percy narrates how Prince Henry boasted
that—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                 "He would unto the stews,  
And from the common’st creature pluck a glove,  
And wear it as a favour; and with that  
He would unhorse the lustiest challenger."</span>

</div>

   The glove was also worn in the hat as the memorial of a friend, and
in the "Merchant of Venice" (iv. 1), Portia, in her assumed character,
asks Bassanio for his gloves, which she says she will wear for his
sake:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your
sake."</span>

</div>

When the fashion of thus wearing gloves declined, "it fell into the
hands of coxcombical and dissolute servants." <span
id="fr_991"></span>[1](#fn_988) Thus Edgar, in "King Lear" (iii. 4),
being asked by Lear what he had been, replies:—"A serving-man, proud in
heart and mind; that curled my hair, wore gloves in my cap," &c.

<span id="page_504">p. 504</span>

   To throw the glove, as the signal of a challenge, is alluded to by
Troilus (iv. 4), who tells Cressida:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"For I will throw my glove to Death himself,  
 That's there's no maculation in thy heart,"</span>

</div>

—the meaning being, says Johnson:—"I will challenge Death himself in
defence of thy fidelity."

   The glove then thrown down was popularly called "a gage," <span
id="fr_992"></span>[1](#fn_989) from the French, signifying a pledge,
and in "Richard II." (iv. 1), it is so termed by Aumerle:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"There is my gage, the manual seal of death,  
 That marks thee out for hell."</span>

</div>

In the same play it is also called "honour's pawn." Thus Bolingbroke (i.
1), says to Mowbray—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,  
 Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,  
 And lay aside my high blood's royalty,  
 Which fear, not reverence, make thee to except.  
 If guilty dread hath left thee so much strength  
 As to take up my honour's pawn, then stoop."</span>

</div>

And further on (iv. 1), one of the Lords employs the same phrase

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">               "There is my honour's pawn;  
Engage to the trial, if thou darest."</span>

</div>

   It is difficult to discover why the glove was recognised as the sign
of defiance. Brand <span id="fr_993"></span>[2](#fn_990) suggests that
the custom of dropping or sending the glove, "as the signal of a
challenge, may have been derived from the circumstance of its being the
cover of the hand, and therefore put for the hand itself. The giving of
the hand is well known to intimate that the person who does so will not
deceive, but stand to his agreement. *To shake hands upon it* would not
be very delicate in

<span id="page_505">p. 505</span>

an agreement to fight, and, therefore gloves may possibly have been
deputed as substitutes."

   Again, the glove was often thrown down as a pledge, as in "Timon of
Athens" (v. 4), where the senator says to Alcibiades:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                   "Throw thy glove,  
Or any token of thine honour else,  
That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress  
And not as our confusion."</span>

</div>

Whereupon Alcibiades answers—"Then, there's my glove." In "King Lear"
(v. 2), Albany thus speaks:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thou art arm’d, Gloucester: let the trumpet
sound:  
 If none appear to prove upon thy head  
 Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,  
 There is my pledge \[throwing down a glove.\] I'll prove it on thy
heart."</span>

</div>

In "Troilus and Cressida" (iv. 5), Hector further alludes to this
practice:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Your quondam wife swears still by Venus’ glove:  
 She's well, but made me not commend her to you."</span>

</div>

   Scented gloves were formerly given away as presents. In "Winter's
Tale," the custom is referred to by Mopsa, who says to the Clown (iv.
4):—"Come, you promised me a tawdry lace, and a pair of sweet gloves;"
and Autolycus is introduced singing:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Gloves as sweet as damask roses."</span>

</div>

In "Much ado about Nothing" (iii. 4), Hero says:—"These-gloves the Count
sent me; they are an excellent perfume." Trinity College, Oxford, not
ungrateful to its founder and his spouse, has many entries, after the
date of 1556, in the Bursar's books, "pro fumigatis chirothecis," for
perfumed gloves.

   *Kiss*.—In years past, a kiss was the recognised fee of a lady's
partner, and as such is noticed in "Henry VIII." (i.4):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I were unmannerly, to take you out,  
 And not kiss you."</span>

</div>

   In the "Tempest" (i. 2), it is alluded to in Ariel's song:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Come unto these yellow sands,  
   And then take hands:</span>

</div>

<span id="page_506">p. 506</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small"><span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span>  Courtsied when you have and kiss’d,  
   The wild waves whist,  
 Foot it featly here and there,  
 And sweet sprites, the burthen bear."</span>

</div>

   There is probably a veiled allusion to the same ceremony in "Winter's
Tale" (iv. 4), where, at the dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses, the
following dialogue occurs:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Clown*.                         Come on, strike
up!  
 *Dorcas*. Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,  
 To mend her kissing with!  
 *Mopsa*.                         Now, in good time!  
 *Clown*. Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.  
         Come, strike up!"</span>

</div>

   In an old treatise, entitled the "Use and Abuse of Dancing and
Minstrelsie," we read:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"But some reply, what fools will daunce,  
 If that when daunce is doon,  
 He may not have at ladyes lips,  
 That which in daunce he doon."</span>

</div>

   The practice of saluting ladies with a kiss was once very general,
and in the "Merry Wives of Windsor," to kiss the hostess is indirectly
spoken of as a common courtesy of the day.

   In "Romeo and Juliet" (i. 5), a further instance occurs, where Romeo
kisses Juliet at Capulet's entertainment; and in "Henry VIII." (i. 4),
Lord Sands is represented as kissing Anne Bullen, next whom he sits at
supper.

   The celebrated "kissing comfits" were sugar plums, once extensively
used by fashionable persons to make the breath sweet. Falstaff, in the
"Merry Wives of Windsor" (v. 5), when embracing Mrs Ford, says:—"Let it
thunder to the tune of Green Sleeves, hail kissing comfits, and snow
erringoes."

   In "Measure for Measure" (iv. i., song) kisses are referred to as
"seals of love." A Judas kiss was a kiss of treachery. Thus in "3 Henry
VI." (v. 7), Gloucester says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                  "So Judas kiss’d his Master,  
And cried 'all hail!' when as he meant all harm."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_507">p. 507</span>

   *Lace Songs*.—These were jingling rhymes, sung by young girls while
engaged at their lace-pillows. A practice alluded to by the Duke in
"Twelfth Night" (ii. 4):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O fellow, come, the song we had last night.  
 Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;  
 The spinsters and the knitters in the sun  
 And the free maids that weave their thread with bones  
 Do use to chant it."</span>

</div>

   Miss Baker, in her "Northamptonshire Glossary" (1854, i. 378), says,
"the movement of the bobbins is timed by the modulation of the tune,
which excites them to regularity and cheerfulness; and it is a pleasing
sight to see them in warm sunny weather, seated outside their cottage
doors, or seeking the shade of a neighbouring tree; where, in cheerful
groups, they unite in singing their rude and simple rhymes. The
following is a specimen of one of these ditties, most descriptive of the
occupation:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Nineteen long lines, bring over my down,  
 The faster I work it, I'll shorten my score,  
 But if I do play, it ’ll stick to a stay,  
 So high ho! little fingers, and twank it away."</span>

</div>

   *Letters*.—The word Emmanuel was formerly prefixed, probably from
feelings of piety, to letters and public deeds. So in "2 Henry VI." (iv.
2), there is the following allusion to it:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Cade*. What is thy name?  
 *Clerk*. Emmanuel.  
 *Dick*. They use to write it on the top of letters."</span>

</div>

   Staunton says: "We can refer to one MS. alone, in the British Museum
(Ad. MSS. 19, 400), which contain no less than fourteen private epistles
headed 'Emanewell,' or 'Jesus Immanuel.'"

   Another superscription of a letter in years gone by was "to the
bosom" of a lady. Thus Hamlet says to Ophelia (ii. 2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"In her excellent white bosom, these."</span>

</div>

And in the "Two Gentlemen of Verona" (iii. 2), Proteus says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence;  
 Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver’d  
 Even in the milk white bosom of thy love."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_508">p. 508</span>

   This custom seems to have originated in the circumstance of women
having a pocket in the forepart of their stays, in which, according to
Steevens, "they carried not only love-letters and love-tokens, but even
their money and materials for needlework."

   *Livery*.—The phrase, "sue my livery," which occurs in the following
speech of Bolingbroke ("King Richard II." ii. 3):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I am denied to sue my livery here,  
 And yet my letters-patents give me leave;  
 My father's goods are all distrain’d and sold,  
 And these and all are all amiss employ’d."</span>

</div>

is thus explained by Malone:—"On the death of every person who held by
knight's service, the escheator of the court in which he died summoned a
jury, who enquired what estate he died seized of, and of what age his
next heir was. If he was under age, he became a ward of the king's; but
if he was found to be of full age, he then had a right to sue out a writ
of *ouster le main*, that is, his livery, that the king's hand might be
taken off, and the land delivered to him." York (ii. 1), also says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's right,  
 Call in the letters patent that he hath,  
 By his attorneys-general to sue  
 His livery."</span>

</div>

   *Love-Day*.—This denoted a day of amity or reconciliation; an
expression which is used by Saturnius in "Titus Andronicus" (i. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends,  
 This day shall be a love-day, Tamora."</span>

</div>

<span class="smallcaps">Military Lore</span>—*Fleshment*.—This is a
military term;—a young soldier being said to *flesh* his sword the first
time he draws blood with it. In "King Lear" (ii. 2), Oswald relates how
Kent:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">          "In the fleshment of this dread exploit,  
Drew on me here again,"</span>

</div>

upon which passage, Singer (ix. 377) has this note:—"Fleshment,
therefore, is here metaphorically applied to the first

<span id="page_509">p. 509</span>

act, which Kent, in his new capacity, had performed for his master; and
at the same time, in a sarcastic sense, although he had esteemed it an
heroic exploit to trip a man behind, who was actually falling." The
phrase occurs again in "1 Henry IV." (v. 4), where Prince Henry tells
his brother:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Come, brother John, full bravely hast thou
flesh’d  
 Thy maiden sword."</span>

</div>

   *Swearing by the Sword*.—According to Nares, <span
id="fr_994"></span>[1](#fn_991) "the singular mixture of religious and
military fanaticism which arose from the Crusades, gave rise to the
custom of taking a solemn oath upon a sword. In a plain unenriched
sword, the separation between the blade and the hilt was usually a
straight transverse bar, which, suggesting the idea of a cross, added to
the devotion which every true knight felt for his favourite weapon, and
evidently led to this practice." Hamlet makes Horatio swear that he will
never divulge having seen the ghost (i. 5):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Never to speak of this that you have seen,  
 Swear by my sword."</span>

</div>

   In the "Winter's Tale" (ii. 3), Leonato says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                "Swear by this sword  
Thou wilt perform my bidding."</span>

</div>

   The cross of the sword is also mentioned to illustrate the true
bearing of the oath. Hence, in 1 Henry IV." (ii. 4), Falstaff says
jestingly of Glendower, that he "swore the devil his true liegeman upon
the cross of a Welsh hook." <span id="fr_995"></span>[2](#fn_992)

   On account of the practice of swearing by a sword, or rather by the
cross or upper end of it, the name of *Jesus* was sometimes inscribed on
the handle or some other part.

   *Mining Terms*.—According to Mr Collier, the phrase "true-penny" is a
mining term current in the north of England, signifying a particular
indication in the soil, of the

<span id="page_510">p. 510</span>

direction in which ore is to be found. Thus, Hamlet says (i. 5):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Ah, ha, boy! say’st thou so? art thou there,
truepenny?"</span>

</div>

when making Horatio and Marcellus again swear that they will not divulge
having seen the ghost.

   *Patrons*.—The custom of clergymen praying for their patrons, in what
is called the bidding prayer, seems alluded to by Kent in "King Lear"
(i. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                       "Royal Lear,  
Whom I have ever honour’d as my king,  
Loved as my father, as my master follow’d,  
As my great patron thought on in my prayers."</span>

</div>

   *Sagittary*.—This was a monster, half man, half beast, described as a
terrible archer; neighing like a horse, and with its eyes of fire
striking men dead like lightning. In "Troilus and Cressida" (v. 5),
Agamemnon says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">            "The dreadful sagittary  
Appals our numbers."</span>

</div>

Hence any deadly shot was called a sagittary. In "Othello" (i. 1) the
barrack is so named from the figure of an archer over the door.

   *Salad Days*.—Days of green youth and inexperience. Cleopatra says
(I. v):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                      "My salad days,  
When I was green in judgement: cold in blood."</span>

</div>

   *Salt*.—The salt of youth is that vigour and strong passion which
then predominates. The term is several times used by Shakespeare for
strong amorous passion. Iago, in "Othello" (iii. 3), refers to it as
"hot as monkeys, as salt as wolves in pride." In "Measure for Measure"
(v. 1), the Duke calls Angelo's base passion, his "salt imagination,"
because he supposed his victim to be Isabella, and not his betrothed
wife, whom he was forced by the Duke to marry. <span
id="fr_996"></span>[1](#fn_993)

   *Salutations*.—God-den was used by our forefathers as soon as noon
was past, after which time "good morrow" or "good-day" was esteemed
improper; the phrase "God ye good den," being a contraction of "God give
you a good

<span id="page_511">p. 511</span>

evening." This fully appears from the following passage in "Romeo and
Juliet" (ii. 4):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Nurse*. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.  
 *Mercutio*. God ye good den, fair gentlewoman."</span>

</div>

Upon being thus corrected, the Nurse asks, "Is it good den?" to which
Mercutio replies, "’Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
dial is now upon the prick of noon."

   A further corruption of the same phrase was "God-dig you den," as
used by Costard in "Love's Labour's Lost" (iv. 1):—"God-dig-you-den
all!" Shakespeare uses it several times, as in "Titus Andronicus" (iv.
4), where the Clown says:—"God and Saint Stephen give you good den;" and
in "King John" (i. 1), the King says: "Good-den, Sir Richard!"

   Another old popular salutation was "good even and twenty" ("Merry
Wives of Windsor," ii. I), equivalent to "twenty good evenings." Mr
Halliwell-Phillipps quotes a similar phrase from Elliot's "Fruits of the
French" (1593), "God night, and a thousand to everybody."

   We may also compare the phrase "good-deed" in "Winter's Tale" (i.
2.); a species of asseveration, as "in very deed."

   *Servants’ Customs*.—The old custom of the servants of great families
taking an oath of fidelity on their entrance into office—as is still the
case with those of the sovereign—is alluded to by Posthumus in
"Cymbeline" (ii. 4), where, speaking of Imogen's servants, he says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                   "Her attendants are  
All sworn and honourable." <span id="fr_997"></span>[1](#fn_994)</span>

</div>

   Gold chains were formerly worn by persons of rank and dignity, and by
rich merchants—a fashion which descended to upper servants in great
houses, and by stewards as badges of office. These chains were usually
cleaned by being rubbed with crumbs. Hence, in "Twelfth Night" (ii. 3),
Sir Toby says to the Clown:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Go, sir, rub your chain with crums."</span>

</div>

   In days gone by, too, it was customary for the servants of the
nobility, particularly the gentleman-usher, to attend bare-headed. In
the procession to the trial in "Henry VIII." (ii. 4), one of the persons
enumerated is a gentleman—

<span id="page_512">p. 512</span>

usher "bare-headed." On grand occasions, coachmen, also, drove
bare-headed, a practice alluded to in Beaumont and Fletcher's "Woman
Hater" (iii. 2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Or a pleated lock, or a bareheaded coachman,  
 This sits like a sign where great ladies are  
 To be sold within."</span>

</div>

   *Sheriff's Post*.—At the doors of sheriffs were usually set up
ornamental posts, on which royal and civic proclamations were fixed. So,
in "Twelfth Night" (i. 5), Malvolia says—"He'll stand at your door like
a sheriff's post." "A pair of mayor's posts," says Staunton, "are still
standing in Norwich, which from the initials T. P., and the date 159–,
are conjectured to have belonged to Thomas Pettys, who was mayor of that
city in 1592."

   *Shoeing-Horn*.—This, from its convenient use in drawing on a tight
shoe, was applied in a jocular metaphor to other subservient and
tractable assistants. Thus Thersites, in "Troilus and Cressida" (v. 1),
in his railing mood gives this name to Menelaus, whom he calls "a
thrifty shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his brother's (Agamemnon)
leg."

   It was also employed as a contemptuous name for danglers on young
women.

   In the same way "shoe-tye" became a characteristic name for a
traveller, a term used by Shakespeare in "Measure for Measure" (iv. 3),
"Master Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty, the great
traveller."

   *A Solemn Supper*.—In Shakespeare's day this was a phrase for a feast
or banquet given on any important occasion, such as a birth, marriage,
&c. Macbeth says (iii. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"To-night we hold a solemn supper, sir,  
 And I'll request your presence."</span>

</div>

   Howel, in a letter to Sir T. Hawke, 1636, says—"I was invited
yesternight to a *solemne supper* by B. J. \[Ben Jonson\], where you
were deeply remembered."

   So in "Romeo and Juliet" (i. 5), Tybalt says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"What dares the slave  
 Come hither, cover’d with an antic face,  
 To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?"</span>

</div>

<span id="page_513">p. 513</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And in "All's Well
That Ends Well" (ii. 3), the King, on the conclusion of the contract
between Helena and Bertram, says

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">              "The solemn feast  
Shall more attend upon the coming space,  
Expecting absent friends."</span>

</div>

   *Statute Caps*.—These were woollen caps enforced by Statute 13
Elizabeth, which, says Strype, in his "Annals" (ii. 74), was "for
continuance of making and wearing woollen caps in behalf of the trade of
cappers; providing that all above the age of six years (excepting the
nobility and some others) should on Sabbath-days and holy-days wear caps
of wool, knit thicked, and drest in England, upon penalty of ten
groats." Thus, in "Love's Labour's Lost" (v. 2), Rosalind says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Well, better wits have worn plain
statute-caps."</span>

</div>

Johnson considered that the statute caps alluded to were those worn by
the members of the universities.

   *Theatrical Lore*.—At the conclusion of a play, or of the epilogue,
it was formerly customary for the actors to kneel down on the stage, and
pray for the sovereign, nobility, clergy, and sometimes for the commons.
So in the epilogue to "2 Henry IV." the dancer says—"My tongue is weary;
when my legs are too, I will bid you good night; and so kneel down
before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen." Collier, in his
"History of English Dramatic Poetry" (iii. 445), tells us that this
practice continued in the commencement of the 17th century.

   *Tournaments*.—In "Coriolanus" (ii. 1) Shakespeare attributes some of
the customs of his own times to a people who were wholly unacquainted
with them. In the following passage we have an exact description of what
occurred at tiltings and tournaments when a combatant had distinguished
himself:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                        "Matrons flung gloves,  
Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,  
Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,</span>

</div>

<span id="page_514">p. 514</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small"><span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span> As to Jove's statue; and the commons made  
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:  
I never saw the like." <span id="fr_998"></span>[1](#fn_995)</span>

</div>

   An allusion to the mock tournaments, in which the combatants were
armed with rushes in place of spears, is used by Othello (v. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Man but a rush against Othello's breast."</span>

</div>

   *Trumpet*.—In olden times it was the fashion for persons of
distinction, when visiting, to be accompanied by a trumpeter, who
announced their approach by a flourish of his trumpet. It is to this
custom, Staunton <span id="fr_999"></span>[2](#fn_996) thinks, that
Lorenzo refers in the "Merchant of Venice" (v. 1), where he tells
Portia—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Your husband is at hand; I hear his
trumpet."</span>

</div>

<span class="smallcaps">War-Cry</span>.—*"God, and Saint George!"*—the
common cry of the English soldier when he charged the enemy—"King
Richard III." (v. 3). The author of the "Old Arte of Warre," printed in
the latter end of Queen Elizabeth's reign, formally enjoins the use of
this cry among his military laws (p. 84):—"Item.—That all souldiers
entring into battaile, assaulte, skirmishe, or other faction of armes,
shall have for their common cry-word, 'Saint George, forward, or upon
them, Saint George!' whereby the souldier is much comforted to minde the
ancient valour of England, which with that name has been so often
victorious; and therefore he who upon any sinister zeale shall
maliciously omit so fortunate a name, shall be severely punished for his
obstinate, erroneous heart and perverse mind."

   *"Havoc!"*—To cry "havoc" appears to have been a signal for
indiscriminate slaughter. The expression occurs in "King John" (ii. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Cry havoc, kings!"</span>

</div>

In "Coriolanus" Menenius says (iii. i)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Do not cry havoc, when you should but hunt  
 With modest warrant."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_515">p. 515</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And in "Julius
Cæsar" (iii. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Cry 'havoc!' and let slip the dogs of war."</span>

</div>

   *"Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!"*—This was the ancient cry of the
English troops when they charged the enemy. It occurs where the
conspirators kill Coriolanus (v. 6).

   *Leet-Ale*.—This was the dinner provided for the jury and customary
tenants at the court-leet of a manor, or "view of frank pledge,"
formerly held once or twice a year, before the steward of the
leet. <span id="fr_1000"></span>[1](#fn_997) To this court Shakespeare
alludes in the "Taming of the Shrew" (i. 2), where the servant tells Sly
that in his dream he would "rail upon the hostess of the house," and
threaten to

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Present her at the leet."</span>

</div>

Aubrey, in his MS. history of Wiltshire, 1678, tells us, too, how "in
the Easter holidays was the Clerk's ale for his private benefit, and the
solace of the neighbourhood."
