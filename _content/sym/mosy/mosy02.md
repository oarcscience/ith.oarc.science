### POSTSCRIPTUM.

At the last moment of going to press I have chanced upon three
remarkable variants of the *swastika* which the Count Goblet d’Alviella
wishes me to reproduce here. The first is from a sepulchral stone at
Meigle in Perthshire, and the second, which is a sinister *swastika*,
from a Cross at St. Vigeans in Forfarshire.

Both these are illustrated in Stuart's *Sculptured Stones of Scotland*.
The third is from one of the old Mahometan buildings of the Mo(n)gol
period at Lahore.

This is also ignorantly rendered as the inauspicious *suwastika;* and
twisted into a legend, which I read as, *ya Fattah*, "O Opener,"
"Beginner," "Leader," "Victorious," "Conqueror," and so forth.
