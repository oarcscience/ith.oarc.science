# The Wandering Host

## by David Starr Jordan

#### \[1904\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an allegorical tale about the search for spiritual meaning.
Jordan was the first President of Stanford University. This etext was
scanned from an copy published in 1904, in an edition with artwork
reminiscent of the "Arts and Crafts" style originated by William Morris.

There were no internal page numbers, so the page breaks are indicated by
a 'vertical bar' character with the note 'page' in the margin in green
type.
