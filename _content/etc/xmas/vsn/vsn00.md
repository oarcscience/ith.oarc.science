<td data-valign="top"><p>’Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br />
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;<br />
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br />
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;<br />
The children were nestled all snug in their beds;<br />
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;<br />
And mamma in her ’kerchief, and I in my cap,<br />
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap;<br />
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br />
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.<br />
Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br />
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.<br />
The moon, on the breast of the new-fallen snow,<br />
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,<br />
When what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br />
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny rein-deer,<br />
With a little old driver, so lively and quick,<br />
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.<br />
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,<br />
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;<br />
"Now, <u>Dasher</u>! now, <u>Dancer</u>! now, <u>Prancer</u> and <u>Vixen</u>!<br />
On <u>Comet</u>! on, <u>Cupid</u>! on <u>Donder</u> and <u>Blitzen</u>!<br />
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!<br />
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"</p></td>

<td data-valign="top"><p>As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<br />
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;<br />
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,<br />
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St. Nicholas too.<br />
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof<br />
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof—<br />
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,<br />
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.<br />
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,<br />
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;<br />
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,<br />
And he look’d like a pedlar just opening his pack.<br />
His eyes—how they twinkled! His dimples how merry!<br />
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br />
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow<br />
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;<br />
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,<br />
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;<br />
He had a broad face and a little round belly<br />
That shook, when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.<br />
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf.<br />
And I laughed, when I saw him, in spite of myself;<br />
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,<br />
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;</p></td>

And fill’d all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,<br />
And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br />
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;<br />
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br />
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.<br />
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,<br />
"<u>Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night</u>."</p>
