<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE Druggist stood in his Place of Business surrounded by Capsules, Hot Water Bags, Perfumes and Fluid Extracts. A Man came in and said he wanted to look at the Directory. Then he asked if "Murphy" was spelled with an "f." He looked at the Hair Brushes, whistled a few bars of the "Spring Song" and went out.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Small Boy entered and wanted to trade two empty Bottles for a Piece of Licorice Root. The Deal fell through, because the Bottles had a Name blown in the Glass.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Woman came in and said she was waiting for a Friend. She had the Druggist bring her a Glass of Plain Water. She said she could not drink Soda Water because the Gas got up her Nose.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another Woman came in for a Stamp. She did not have any Change with her, but was going to come in and hand him the Two Cents some time; that is, if he was Small enough to remember it.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next who came in was a Man with hardly any Chin. He wanted a Free Sample of Liver Pills and an Almanac telling the Date of the Battle of New Orleans, when the Sun rises and sets and why the Chicken crossed the Road.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After him there came a Man who was in a Hurry and wanted to use the Phone. He was vexed when he learned that Skinner &amp; Skinner did not have any Number. He asked the Druggist why it was. The Druggist said he was sorry and would See to it before the Man came in again.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after two little Girls came on a Run and helped themselves to Picture Cards. They left the Door open, and a Boy in Overalls stepped in to ask if he could hang a Lithograph in the Window. The Druggist went back into the Laboratory and got a large stone Pestle. He was just ready to beat the Life out of the Cash Register when an Elderly Gentleman came in with a Prescription.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Druggist Stayed the Blow and chirked up quite a bit. "This is where I catch even on the Day," he said.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was no Mirage. He had to and he did.</p>  
<p>MORAL: Don't Blame the Druggist.</p>
