<P>
Every rock band has its own mythological creation story.
The Grateful Dead claim that Jerry Garcia was looking through a 'large
book' one day (no doubt in some altered state of mind),
and the phrase just popped out at him.
The specific book is unknown, but scholars of the band have suggested
it was a large dictionary of folklore, with an article on the topic
originally proposed in this book.
</P>
<P>
The term <I>The Grateful Dead</I> originally referred to
a set of folklore motifs relating to stories where the hero
does a good turn for a dead person and gets rewarded thereby.
This motif appears in a wide set of cultures, not all of which
have an obvious connection.
In the late 19th and early 20th century the field of
folklore had matured to the point to where there was enough data
to analyze these motifs cross-culturally.
This book was one of the first to do a comprehensive study of one
such motif on a world-wide basis, and as such occupies an important position
in the study of folklore.
Gerould analyzed over a hundred variants of the story, mostly from European,
Near East and Asian sources.
He used techniques originally used by comparative linguistics
to compare the stories and untangle the development of the motif.
<P>
Of course, there is also extensive folklore about the band of the same name,
much of which I was exposed to in college.
A popular motif in deadhead lore is the <I>Magic Ticket</I>.
However, I've never encountered any variant where the
<I>Ticket</I> appeared because
someone did an actual dead person a favor. . .
