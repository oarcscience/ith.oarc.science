# FORTUNE AND LUCK

If Fortune favor you, be not elated;  
If she frown, do not despond.  
     --AUSONIUS.

When Fortune means to men most good,  
She looks upon them with a threatening eye.  
     --King John, III. 4, 119.

When smiling Fortune spreads her golden ray,  
All crowd around to flatter and obey;  
But when she thunders from the angry sky,  
Our friends, our flatterers, our lovers fly.  
     --OVID.

Since Fortune is not in our power,  
Let us be as little as possible in hers.  
     --STEELE.
