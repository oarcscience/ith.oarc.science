# 1. TYCHE, THE GRECIAN GODDESS OF GOOD LUCK

AMONG the more popular divinities of the early Grecians was Tyche, the
goddess of good luck, whose worship, according to Plutarch, complemented
that of Destiny. She ruled over accidental events, and was the dispenser
alike of blessings and misfortunes; but when too lavish in the
distribution of her favors she was liable to incur the jealousy of
Nemesis, the goddess of retribution.

Tyche, the Goddess of Fortune, is not mentioned in the works of the
earliest Grecian poets, but Homer and Hesiod both allude to an ocean
nymph of this name who was gathering flowers with Proserpina when the
latter was carried off by Pluto.

The Theban lyric poet Pindar appears to have originated the worship of
Tyche, whom he celebrated in verse, and invested with the title
Pharopolis, or Protectress of Cities; and in Greece, towards the close
of the fifth century B.C., this goddess was generally believed to be the
ruler of worldly affairs. While Zeus was, indeed, the most powerful of
the gods, Tyche was regarded by some as having the character of
Providence; yet she was more generally thought to be identical with
Chance or Luck. The famous Ionic philosopher Anaxagoras said that
Fortune was a cause unknown to human reason; for some things come by
Necessity, some by fatal Destiny, and others by deliberate Counsel.
