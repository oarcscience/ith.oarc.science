### PERSIAN

At the time when the Assyrian kings of the neo-Babylonian epoch were
publishing the Babylonian mythological cycles, and when Egyptian and
Greek mythologies were flourishing, the original Persian or Iranian
mythology was being stopped in its growth; afterwards nearly all records
of it were destroyed. This happened in the reign of Darius (sixth
century B.C.), through the rise of the Mazdean or Zoroastrian dualism
which, accepted by the king and the governing classes, had the effect of
depriving the old mythology of all value and significance.

The Zoroastrian dualism represented a religion that was on a higher
level than the religions of Egypt and Babylon. Says Professor
Rostovtzeff :

Like the Hebrew prophets, Zoroaster reached the conception of a single
spiritual god, Ormuzd or Ahura Mazda, in whom the principle of good is
personified, while the evil principle is embodied in Ariman or Angra
Mainyu. The two principles strive eternally in life and nature, and in
the struggle men take part. Man is responsible for his actions, good and
bad; he is the master of his fate; his will determines his line of
conduct. If he struggles against evil, confesses God, and cares for the
purity of his body and soul, then, after four periods, of three thousand
years each, in the world's history, when the time shall arrive for final
victory of good over evil and of Ormuzd over Ariman--the general
resurrection of the dead and the last judgment will assure him his place
among the saved and the righteous. <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8)

The Persian religion had strong influence upon both Judaism and early
Christianity: a king who was the champion of early Zoroastrianism ended
the Babylonian captivity and enabled the Jews to reconstitute themselves
as a religious body; the star of the Nativity was hailed by

<span id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span>

the Magi who were Persians and Zoroastrians. This religion in the form
of the worship of one of the angelic powers of Zoroastrian theology,
Mithra, spread through the West during the late Roman Empire, and made
itself a powerful rival of young Christianity. Mithra, who was
identified with the Sun, had a cult that was fostered by the Roman
military guild; it is known that as far west as Britain there was a
temple built to him. Present-day Christianity, on the side of ceremony
and ritual, has elements that have come into it from its one-time
closeness to Mithraism. If we read Francis Thompson's "Orient Ode" we
shall know something of the fervours of Mithraism; it is significant
that the metaphors in the opening verse are from the sacred ritual of
the Mass:

Lo, in the sanctuaried East,  
Day, a dedicated priest  
In all his robes pontifical exprest,  
Lifteth slowly, lifteth sweetly,  
From out its Orient tabernacle drawn,  
Yon orbéd sacrament confest  
Which sprinkles benediction through the dawn.

\[paragraph continues\] Mithraic feeling is stronger in another verse:

Thou art the incarnated Light  
Whose Sire is aboriginal, and beyond  
Death and resurgence of our day and night;  
From his is thy vicegerent wand  
With double potence of the black and white.  
Giver of Love, and Beauty, and Desire,  
The terror, and the loveliness, and purging,  
The deathfulness and lifefulness of fire!

The original mythology of Iran or Persia is supposed to have been of the
type that existed in Aryan India around 1000 B.C.--the mythology of the
Vedic Hymns. Many names out of the oldest strata of Iranian tradition
can be equated with names in the Vedic Hymns. One of these names is Yima
which in later Persian becomes Jamshīd. Yima is the same as the Vedic
god Yama: Yama, in India, was the god of the dead. "The evidence
concerning Yama-Yima," writes Albert J. Carnoy, "is, on the whole, that
he is the setting sun. He follows the path of the sun to go to a remote
recess, whither he leads all men with him. . . . In Iran the solar
nature of Yima is rather more accentuated than in India, and the old
epithets of Yima are striking

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

in this respect. He is commonly called *Khshaēta* ('brilliant'), an
adjective which is at the same time a regular epithet of the sun." <span
id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9) The story of Jamshīd is the most explicit
piece of mythology that has come down to us from ancient Iran--it is
preserved in a very late work--in the Shāhnāmah, written by the poet
Firdausī, who died about 1025 A. D. Firdausī used old traditions which
were mythology that had been turned into pseudo-historical legends. It
is of interest to note that not long after the time when Firdausī
treated the fragments of an Aryan mythology as historical traditions and
romantic tales, a like work was accomplished at the other side of the
Aryan world--in Wales where the fragments of Celtic mythology were made
over into the collection of romantic stories that we know as the
Mabinogion.
