### SECTION X

#### ASPECTS OF THE MOON.

LIGHT being pleasant to man and Darkness more or less awful, the
original aspect of the Moon is a friendly and favourable one as the head
of nocturnal kosmic order, the beneficent Unicorn, the 'Righteous' Ass
of the *Bundahis*, who is hated and warred against by the powers of
evil. But the Moon may be the friend as well as the enemy of Night, and
as such becomes Gorgonian and terrific, connected with witchcraft, evil
demons, 'wicked apparitions,' <span id="fr_279"></span>[1](#fn_279) and
all the power and horror of great darkness; whilst its changing form
admits of monstrous concrete representation in art and fancy.

With reference to the Sun; the Moon may with almost equal propriety
appear as the sire, mother, brother, sister, husband, bride or nurse of
the mighty star; friendly to the Sun, as Inô or Sin; hostile as the
Unicorn; pursued by or pursuing the Sun.

When civilization progresses sufficiently to possess a Calendar, the
Moon, as time-measurer, lends invaluable assistance, and marks the
months.

As lord of moisture and humidity, the Moon is

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

connected with growth and the nurturing power of the peaceful night.

The Moon too, like the Sun, speaks of a future life, so that even the
rude Congo Negro claps his hands and cries, 'So may I renew my life as
thou art renewed;' <span id="fr_280"></span>[1](#fn_280) and in the
famous Namaqua-myth 'the Moon once sent the Hare to Men to give this
message, "Like as I die and rise to life again, so you also shall die
and rise to life again."' <span id="fr_281"></span>[2](#fn_281)

According to the anthropomorphic principle the Moon appears in male or
female form, and is symbolically connected with the Bull or Cow, Unicorn
or Horse, Serpent, Dog and Cat, with the latter animal probably on
account of phenomena of periodicity, cats’ eyes shining in the dark,
etc. <span id="fr_282"></span>[3](#fn_282) It is also at times a pearl
or a good fairy. <span id="fr_283"></span>[4](#fn_283)

Regarded as a locality, it often appears as the abode of departed souls.
So in the Kamic *Book of the Respirations*, which is probably of the
epoch of the Ptolemies, the wish is expressed respecting the deceased,

'That his soul may rise to heaven in the disk of the Moon.' <span
id="fr_284"></span>[5](#fn_284)

Such are some of the principal mythological lunar aspects. If the savage
at times regards her

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

as cleft in sunder by the angry sun, the poet at times also has his mere
fancies—fancies as distinguished from the ordinary growths of
mythology—and compares her to a lunatic and dying lady, tottering forth

                             'Led by the insane  
And feeble wanderings of her fading brain.' <span
id="fr_285"></span>[1](#fn_285)

But in health we do not speak thus, and so to this same great singer in
a nobler moment she is an orbed maiden with white fire \[white gold\]
laden.'

<span id="img_07100"></span> ![FIG. 4](img/07100.jpg)

More grandly did Milton see her, in his stately vision, throwing 'her
silver mantle o’er the dark,' even as Homer and Tennyson saw

                  'The stars about the moon  
Look beautiful, when all the winds are laid,  
And every height comes out, and jutting peak  
And valley, and the immeasurable heavens  
Break open to their highest.'

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

I append two Figures <span id="fr_286"></span>[1](#fn_286) illustrating
the origin of the terms Caput and Cauda Draconis as applied to the
moon's nodes (knots), or the two points in the heavens where the moon's
orbit intersects the plane of the ecliptic.

The circling path of the sun becomes similarly the

<span id="img_07200"></span> ![FIG. 5.](img/07200.jpg)

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Time-serpent,
Kampê ('Caterpillar'), a monster slain by the solar Dionysos. <span
id="fr_287"></span>[2](#fn_287) These two lunar serpents, twin
crescents, the increasing and decreasing moon, and whose combination
makes the full moon, are the two bulls which draw the moon-car on its
path through space. <span id="fr_288"></span>[3](#fn_288)
