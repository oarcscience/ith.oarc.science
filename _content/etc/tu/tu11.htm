<p>THE next phase of the Unicorn is, I think, a novel one, and will solve a previously-felt difficulty. In the Pahlavi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_255"></A><A HREF="#fn_255"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> work, the <i>Bundahish</i> or <i>Bundahis</i>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_256"></A><A HREF="#fn_256"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is a circumstantial account of a wonderful animal called 'the Three-legged Ass,' which, according to M. Darmesteter,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_257"></A><A HREF="#fn_257"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is a personification of cloud, storm, etc.; but whilst this hypothesis can never be demonstrated, I think on a review of the evidence the contrary will clearly appear. The writer states;&#151;</p>  
<p>'Regarding the three-legged ass they say, that it stands amid the wide-formed ocean, and its feet are three, eyes six, mouths nine, ears two and HORN ONE, body white, food spiritual, and it is righteous.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_258"></A><A HREF="#fn_258"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>This puzzle to commentators now at once becomes luminous. The triform, triquetric Moon stands amid the wide Oversea of heaven, the 'mare magnum sine fine,' and 'its feet are three.' To what other personage or phenomenon would this apply? To attempt to explain every detail in the late and elaborated,</p>  
<p>

<p>and possibly in part purely arbitrary, account would be very unsafe. Suffice it if the main outline comes out quite clearly. The Ass, a wise and sagacious animal, especially in Eastern idea,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_259"></A><A HREF="#fn_259"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> has six eyes or two for each of the three phases; the Horse-Serpent-Dog-Moon has six eyes. There is some doubt about the word translated 'mouths;' it may mean 'testes,' and, if so, would connect the moon as usual with fertility and increase. The two ears may be the two ends of the horn, which is that of the lunar Unicorn. Its body is of course white&#151;Leukothe&ecirc;. From the archaic time of the Babylonian Moon-god Sin 'it is righteous,' nay, the leader of righteousness and of kosmic order; and as a righteous and heavenly being its food, if it have any, must be 'spiritual.'</p>  
<p>The description continues;&#151;</p>  
<p>'And two of its six eyes are in the position of eyes,' <i>i.e.</i>, in the full face or Serpent-moon; 'two on the top of the head' on the Dog-moon, the Half- or New-moon; 'and two in the position of the hump,' <i>i.e.</i>, in the Unicorn-horse, the Crescent or Gibbous-moon. 'With the sharpness of these six eyes it overcomes and destroys;'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_260"></A><A HREF="#fn_260"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <i>i.e.</i>, the dread lunar face and lunar eye which, as we have seen, drives away evil and scares wicked souls. The eye is the chief power of the Ass, as it is of the Gorg&ocirc;. The whole extraordinary description is, on analysis, most palpably lunar.</p>  
<p>'Of the nine mouths three are in the head, three</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_64"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 64</FONT></A></p>  
<p>in the hump, and three in the inner part of the flanks.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_261"></A><A HREF="#fn_261"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> The mouths are distributed amongst the phases in the same manner as the eyes. The hump, so far as any actual animal supplies the imagery, will be that of the Indian ox. The increased number may express intensity, and the mouths be more or less Gorgonian.</p>  
<p>'The one horn is as it were of gold and hollow. With that horn it will vanquish and dissipate all the vile corruption due to the efforts of noxious creatures.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_262"></A><A HREF="#fn_262"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> This is the pure bright unicorn's horn that drives away darkness and evil, cleanses streams and pools, and by which 'venym is defended.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_263"></A><A HREF="#fn_263"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>'When it stales in the ocean all the sea-water will become purified. . . . If, O three-legged ass! you were not created for the water, all the water in the sea would have perished.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_264"></A><A HREF="#fn_264"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> The sea-and-water-ruling moon.</p>  
<p>'T&icirc;star seizes the water more completely from the ocean with the assistance of the three-legged ass.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_265"></A><A HREF="#fn_265"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> In <i>Bundahis</i>, vii. 2, we read;&#151;</p>  
<p>'Every single month is the owner of one constellation; the month T&icirc;r is the fourth month of the year, Cancer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_266"></A><A HREF="#fn_266"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> the fourth constellation from Aries, so it is the owner of Cancer, into which T&icirc;star sprang, and displayed the characteristics of a producer of</p>

<p>rain.' T&icirc;star, Tistrya or Tishtrya, is Sirius,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_267"></A><A HREF="#fn_267"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> who, as the stellar protagonist, co-operates with the Moon in ruling water and regulating that humidity which is necessary to vitality.</p>  
<p>'T&icirc;star was converted into three forms, the form of a man and the form of a horse and the form of a bull; thirty days and nights he was distinguished in brilliance; and in each form he produced rain ten days and nights; as the astrologers say that every constellation has three forms.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_268"></A><A HREF="#fn_268"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>In this very interesting passage we see the Triform Moon reduplicated in a triform Sirius, himself in his glorious light a second moon. His special period of brilliance is that of the lunar course, and like the Moon, he takes the forms of horse and bull.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_269"></A><A HREF="#fn_269"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>When we get as late as the formulated systems of 'the astrologers,' each zodiacal constellation has three forms as divided into three decans, and it appears that the extra-zodiacal constellations were also regarded in some way as triform. These are the elaborations of previous simpler observation, and probably originally based upon, lunar triformity. Thus T&icirc;star 'the shining, majestic, the first ten nights unites himself with a body, with the body of a youth</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_66"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 66</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of fifteen years, a shining one, with bright eyes. The second ten nights, T&icirc;star unites himself with a body, proceeding along the clear space, with the body of a bull with golden hoofs.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_270"></A><A HREF="#fn_270"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> The third ten nights T&icirc;star unites himself with a body, with the body of a horse, a shining, beautiful one, with yellow ears, with a golden housing.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_271"></A><A HREF="#fn_271"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> These phases, however, do not really apply to Sirius but to Lunus, and hence their origin.</p>  
<p>The three-legged lunar ass is found on coins and elsewhere under the familiar form of the Triquetra,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_272"></A><A HREF="#fn_272"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the origin of which appears thus;&#151;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_273"></A><A HREF="#fn_273"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> It is familiar on coins of Sicily as the national monetary type, a connexion however which is probably merely based upon the shape of the island&#151;Trinacria or, as the Roman poets sometimes actually call it, Triquetra. But in the case of the Isle of Man no such reason can be admitted as explanatory.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_274"></A><A HREF="#fn_274"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Planch&eacute; remarks;&#151;</p>

<p>'The arms of Man are legs, or in less equivocal language, the ancient kingdom of Man was, and the island itself is still, represented in heraldry by three legs in armour, conjoined at the thighs. Our example of this heraldic curiosity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_275"></A><A HREF="#fn_275"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is particularly interesting, because the armour in which the legs are encased is the banded mail of the thirteenth century, and therefore presents us with the earliest appearance of the armorial coat of that Island and Sovereignty, after it had ceased to be Norwegian, A.D. 1264. <i>The origin of the bearing has yet to be discovered</i>.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_276"></A><A HREF="#fn_276"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Behold it.</p>  
<p>On coins of the ancient Greek city of Metabon (Metapontion-Metapontum) on the Tarentine Gulf, the three crescent legs appear in a variant phase thus;&#151;The dots show that the three crescents<A NAME="img_06700"></A>

A favourite type on coins of Metabon is the Ear-of-corn which is always, and doubtless justly, connected with local fertility and the cult of Damater-Ceres; but at the same time the resemblance between the Ear and the Sacred Tree of the Euphrates Valley is very striking.</p>

<p>Another coin of Metabon shows a bull's head, a type which may be lunar.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_277"></A><A HREF="#fn_277"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>A triquetric ornament appears also at Troy and Myk&ecirc;n&ecirc;.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_278"></A><A HREF="#fn_278"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

According to Olympiodoros (MS. <i>Comment</i>. on the <i>Gorgias</i>), 'the ancient theologists' said that 'the Moon is drawn by two bulls; by two, on account of her increase and diminution; by bulls, because as these till the ground [Not much tillage is done by bulls], so the Moon governs all those parts which surround the earth.'</P>
