### CHAPTER VI

### SOURCES OF MATERIAL FOR FAIRY TALES: A LIST OF FAIRY TALES, PICTURES, PICTURE-BOOKS, POEMS, AND BOOKS

    Shall we permit our children, without scruple, to hear any fables
composed by any authors indifferently, and so to receive into their
minds opinions generally the reverse of those which, when they are grown
to manhood, we shall think they ought to entertain? -- PLATO, in The
Republic.

    ANY list of fairy tales for little children must be selected from
those books which, as we have noted, contain the best collections of
folk-lore, and from books which contain tales that rank as classics. An
examination of the tales of Perrault, of Grimm, of Dasent, of Andersen,
of Jacobs, of Harris, and of miscellaneous titles, to see what are
suited to the little child, would result in the following lists of
tales. Those most worthy of study for the kindergarten are marked with
an asterisk and those suited to the first grade are marked "1." No
attempt has been made to mention all the varied sources of a tale or its
best version. The Boston Public Library issues a Finding List of Fairy
Tales and Folk Stories, which may be procured easily, and the Carnegie
Library at Pittsburg issues in its monthly bulletin for December, 1913,
vol. 18, no. 10, a List of Folk-Tales, and other stories which may be
dramatized. The Baker, Taylor Company, in 1914,

issued a Graded Guide to Supplementary Reading, which contains a list of
many of the best editions of folk and fairy tales suited to primary
grades. A list of school editions is included in this book. But one
cannot fail to be impressed with the general low literary standard of
many school editions of fairy tales when judged by the standards here
applied to the tales themselves. -
