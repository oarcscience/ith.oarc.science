<p>I now have the pleasure of enclosing two photographs, representing, the one a string of symbols or headings of a native song, and the other the boy singing the song from the string.</p> 
<p>The song itself and the string came from the Mayumba district, <i>i.e.</i>, that country to the north and east of Loango.</p> 
<p>The string is composed of pieces of stick, shells, calabashes, and skins and feathers strung together.</p> 
<p>1st line. A piece of rounded stick about an inch long.<br> 2nd The shell of a peanut.<br> 3rd A piece of rounded stick with two notches in it.<br> 4th Two pieces of rounded stick (two wives of the dead represented by a small bundle of cloth).<br> 5th A piece of rounded stick (ximanga liambu).<br> 6th Two pieces of rounded stick (ngoma and mavungu).<br> 7th line A piece of calabash (ntumbu).<br> 8th Two pieces of rounded stick (two women).<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One little piece of mandioca.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One piece of husk of palm-kernel.<br> 9th One piece of rounded stick (one woman, Buketi).<br> 10th with string round it (nganga nsassi).<br> 11th (Buyali).<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One piece of hollow wood for canoe.<br> 12th One rounded piece of calabash (sun).<br> One half-moon-shaped piece of calabash (moon).<br> 13th One short piece of round stick (two notches).<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One small round stick (hammer).<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One small bundle of cloth (Bisakala).<br> 14th One piece of wood in shape of cross supposed to represent man with drum between his legs.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very small piece of wood as drumstick.<br> 15th One round piece of wood (xivunda).<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One smaller piece (son).<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bit of the leaf of Indian corn.<br> 16th A flat piece of wood representing bark of a tree.<br> 17th Round piece of stick with string round top (Nganga bi yango).<br> 18th Round piece of stick, one notch (son).<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small piece of stick, drumstick (ngoma).<br> 19th Flat piece of stick like spoon (cease eating).<br> 20th Two little bits of stem of tobacco (pipe and tobacco).<br> 21st Small flat stick (xibala. nganzi).<br> 22nd Rather long round stick with forked stick tied round the top representing Father Makuika, a prisoner.<br> 23rd Small piece of pipe.<br> 24th Round piece of stick tied round the middle.<br> 25th Small piece of grass.<br> 26th Shell.<br> 27th Imitation of a comb.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piece of wood like hand-mirror.<br> 28th Round stick tied to string 3/4 way up.<br> 29th Skin of Mpakasa.<br> 30th Tail of Ngumba.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piece of skin.<br> 31st Piece of skin of big antelope (sungu).<br> 32nd Tail-feather of parrot (nkusu).<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tail-feather of pheasant (mbulu nkoko).</p> 
<p>So much, then, for the symbols; now for the song. One boy holds one end of the string while the singer holds the other; then, as the latter sings, his fingers touch the symbols. He sings a sentence, the other boy and the onlookers repeat it.</p> 
<p>1. Xitini xinkondo xifumina ku Sundi. (Shoots of the silk-cotton tree came from Sundi.)[1]<br> 2. Lunguba lu nkuanji lu fumina ku Sundi.
