# Pin Point

Pin Point, a Negro community about nine miles southeast of Savannah, is
scattered over some twenty or thirty acres on a peninsula overlooking
Shipyard Creek. Many of the small wooden cabins are neatly whitewashed
and are half hidden by shrubbery and spreading oaks. Flowers and
vegetables are planted in the most advantageous sunny spots near the
houses and most of the yards are enclosed by picket fences, giving a
cozy and pleasant privacy. The lanes, little more than wagon tracks,
twist in and out and across the settlement. The informal and haphazard
scattering of the houses, with high shrubbery bordering the lanes, gives
an effect that is pleasing and unusual.

Pin Point has a church, a pavilion on the tidewater creek, and a crab
cannery. The men and women who do not work as domestic servants at the
nearby country places find employment in the crab cannery or fish and
crab and shrimp for themselves. The life is quiet, soothed by the smell
of the salt marsh.

It is only when some great excitement takes place, a stirring religious
service, a dance at the community pavilion, a
death, [37b](das26.htm#xref_37b),  [37c](das26.htm#xref_37c) or some
scandal concerning a neighbor, that quiet Pin Point bestirs itself.
Recently, one of the fishermen ventured into the foreign waters of the
Ogeechee about ten miles distant and there he was almost devoured by an
alligator. All that was left of him, "the ham," was given a
burial [2](das26.htm#xref_2) amid the loud lamentations of his relatives
and neighbors.

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

The people are, almost without exception, black or dark skinned, proud,
upstanding and loyal, suspicious of strangers but generous and trusting
to friends. Most of the very old inhabitants have died in the past
decade, so that to have reached the age of sixty places a man or woman
in the patriarchal class. The grown people between twenty-five and
thirty, are still close to the traditions and beliefs in which they have
been reared. Firmly believing in the Bible, they still are aware of
other beliefs and customs handed down by their parents and grandparents.

A pleasant, intelligent woman <span id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_89) of
about forty-five chatted with us. "Cose, det is duh will ub God, but dey
do say jis duh same wen a pusson die, 'Maybe somebody fix
em' [15](das26.htm#xref_15) aw 'I sho know dat uhmun wuz rooted.' I ain
nebuh bought no powduh muhsef but jis day befo yestuhdy a uhmun frum
Tatemville wuz right yuh tuh dis house sellin High John duh Conqueruh
fuh fifty cent an she sho say it would bring yuh powuhful good luck, but
I ain hab fifty cent. [8](das26.htm#xref_8)

"Cose, it ain good tuh fool much wid dem tings, but yuh sho hab tuh be
keahful not tuh let no enemy git bole uh yuh haiah combins; cuz dey say
dey sho could fix yuh den." [10](das26.htm#xref_10) She laughed a little
uneasily. "Ef yuh dream ub a snake dassa enemy neahby too, but ef yuh
weah a snake skin roun yuh wais, it good fuh wut ail
yuh. [50d](das26.htm#xref_50d),  [50e](das26.htm#xref_50e) An ef uh
enemy come tuh yuh house an yuh dohn wahn im deah no mo, yuh jis take
duh bruhm an sweep out quick attuh im. Den sprinkle a lill salt on duh
flo weah his foot track bin an sweep em all out duh doe an he sho wohn
come back no mo."

At this point in her narrative a swarm of barefoot children, black and
with shining eyes, clustered around us. One and all were eating crabs,
biting into the soft part of the body shell or cracking a claw with
strong white teeth. Word had evidently just gone out that some
excitement was brewing. Strangers had come and were talking to "Miz
Minnie." If anything was going on they didn't want to miss it. But "Miz
Minnie" felt differently. "Go long, yuh chillun. Go long wid yuh crahb
an stop lissnin tuh grown folks." Minnie flapped her apron and they
scattered like a brood of young chicks.

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

"Yasm, cose yuh do heah bout cunjuhin." [15](das26.htm#xref_15) Minnie
turned back to us. "Dasso. Dey's alluz talk bout it, an I know ole Lewis
McIver wut libs, yuh right now, wut foun a bottle buried in his
mattress. He wuz sick an somebody wuz tryin tuh fix im. I seen dat
bottle muhsef, wid muh own eyes. Yes, ma'am, I sho seen it. It hab
yulluhlak oily lookin stuff in it an deah wuz a piece uh clawt stuck tru
wid needles an pins in it." [8](das26.htm#xref_8) Minnie looked worried
at the mere memory. "I seen it fuh sho an dohn nobody know who put it
deah. But Lewis is bettuh sence it wuz took out. He say he ain hab neah
so much pain.

"Den wen muh ole uncle wuz sick, [15](das26.htm#xref_15) dey sen fuh a
ole uhmun wut know bout cunjuh [48](das26.htm#xref_48) an she wehn out
in duh yahd an dig up a piece uh clawt wadded intuh a ball wid nails in
it an she cas it away. I seen dat too. She say somebody plant it deah
gense im.

"Dey make mojoes outn anyting but dey do say grabeyahd
dut [9](das26.htm#xref_9) an nails an blood an
haiah, [10](das26.htm#xref_10) dey is impawtant. Cose I know bettuhn
belieb all dis," she laughed, "but it make yuh sked an yuh sho full uh
worry ef somebody tryin tuh fix yuh." After cogitating on these dangers
Minnie smiled, "But ef yuh weahs a silbuh dime tied tuh yuh ankle an yuh
step obuh anyting wut put down fuh yuh, duh dime'll sho tun black sudden
an quick an den yuh knows it." [12a](das26.htm#xref_12a),
 [12c](das26.htm#xref_12c),  [12d](das26.htm#xref_12d)

Pin Point attained a certain measure of fame as the setting of the
Bo-Cat murder in 1932. Limerick De Lancy, Pin Point Negro nicknamed
Bo-Cat, killed his wife, Catherine, and dropped her corpse into the deep
waters near Hell Gate. When the crime was discovered, the fact that it
had taken place on Friday, the thirteenth, loomed significant in the
consciousness of the small community and in no time inspired a ballad.
Attributed to no single author but apparently added to from time to
time, the ballad now runs:

On duh thuteent day ub May  
Yuh could heah ole Bo-Cat say,  
"Git muh deed an policy.  
Tun it in duh ashes way."

Den ole Catherine she begin tuh inquyuh.  
Didn know ole Bo-Cat had dem in duh fyuh.  
It a shame how Bo-Cat done he wife. <span id="page_80">p. 80</span>  
Put uh in duh boat,  
Dey begin tuh float,  
Dey float tuh duh Raccoon Keys.  
He knock uh on duh knees.  
Catherine holluh, "Wa-Wan-Wa."  
Bo-Cat make uh "Na-Nan-Na."  
It a shame how Bo-Cat done he wife.

He knock uh in duh bres  
An duh oah don duh res.  
It a shame how Bo-Cat done he wife.

He knock uh in duh back  
An duh oah miss an crack.  
It a shame how Bo-Cat done he wife.  
Wen Bo-Cat wehn back home  
He meet uh daughtuh all alone.  
Uh daughtuh say, "Bo-Cat, Bo-Cat,  
Weah my mama is?"  
Bo-Cat tun right out he head  
An he tro uh cross duh bed.  
It a shame how Bo-Cat done he wife.

Dey got Bo-Cat in jail  
Bout tuh hang im by duh rail  
It a shame how Bo-Cat done he wife.

One of the Pin Point women, Margaret Snead, <span
id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90) recalls vividly the events of the De Lancy
crime.

"Wy, duh night fo Catherine De Lanzy wuz kill, she spen it in town wid

Catherine off down duh ribbuh an murduh uh. A double bad luck, Friday an
duh thuteent, [21](das26.htm#xref_21) das wy dey make up duh song."

"Was the body buried at Pin Point?" we were interested to know.

"Yes, it wuz, but we didn hab no settin-up cuz duh body wuz too fah
gone. Dat wuz sad. Ebrybody lub Catherine an fuh uh tuh die an be buried

"Dis staht off duh whole congregation an deah mustuh bin neah a hundud

"Way was Limerick De Lancy called Bo-Cat?" we asked.

"Deah ain no signifcunse tuh dat. I hab a frien dat ebrybody call Friday
but [20](das26.htm#xref_20) uh name is Lula. I hab a cousin name Angus
Bond an a son name May Bud simply cuz he wuz bawn in May. One uh muh
brothuhs wuz call Baby Head cuz at birth he wuz a tiny baby wid sech a
great big head.

"No, I dohn pay much mine tuh names," said Margaret Snead. "But I do pay
tention tuh bad luck dates. Look uh po Catherine De Lanzy, depribe ub
all duh propuh tings dat come fo burial, cuz it wuz a double bad luck
date. Folks at duh Pint do say dat uh spirit nebuh will res in duh
