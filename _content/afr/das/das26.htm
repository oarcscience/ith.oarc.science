<p><A NAME="xref_1a"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">1a</FONT></A> <i>Basden says of the Ibo</i>: "The desire of every Ibo man and woman is to die in their own town or, at least, to be buried within its precincts. For a long period it was very difficult to persuade a man to travel any distance from his native place, and if he were in need of medical assistance an Ibo would seldom agree to go from home in spite of assurances that he would be able to have better treatment elsewhere. in case of death occurring at a distance, if it can be done at all, the brethren will bring the body home for burial. It may be that this cannot be done for several days, according to distance and other circumstances."<br> <i>Among the Ibos of Nigeria, pp. 115-16</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_1b"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">1b</FONT></A> Bosman says of the coast of Guinea: "The Negroes are strangely fond of being buried in their own Country; so that if any Person dies out of it, they frequently bring his Corpse home to be buried, unless it be too far distant."<br> <i>Description of the Coast of Guinea, p. 232</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_1c"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">1c</FONT></A> <i>Meek says of Nigeria</i>: 'When a man dies at a distance from his home his body is always taken back, when possible, to his home, wrapped up in mats covered by a cloth and placed on a bier or cradle, which is carried on the shoulders of his relatives. The reason assigned for this is that the dead must not be severed from the company of other ancestors--they should be buried close to their living descendants on whom they are dependent for nourishment. Moreover, it is important that the ritual traditional to the kindred should be carried out accurately. This cannot be done by strangers."<br> <i>Law and Authority in a Nigerian Tribe, p. 309</i>.</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_2b"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">2b</FONT></A> <i>Ellis says of the Gold Coast</i>: "<i>Toh-fo</i>, 'one lost' is a ceremony held when a person has met with death, and the body has either been destroyed or cannot be found; for instance, when a man has been burned to death and the body reduced to ashes, or when one has been drowned and the body cannot be recovered. . . . In the case of a man destroyed by fire, some of the ashes of the burned body, or of the house in which it was consumed, are placed in the coffin with similar ceremonies.</p> 
<p>"In this ceremony a fragment of the corpse is always interred if possible; and, if no portion of it can be found, some earth, water, or other substance from the locality in which the death occurred."<br> <i>The Tshi-Speaking Peoples of the Gold Coast of West Africa, p. 223</i>.</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_4a"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">4a</FONT></A> <i>Beckwith says of Jamaica</i>: "A baby born with a caul has the power to see duppies without the duppies' harming him.

<p><A NAME="xref_4c"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">4c</FONT></A> <i>Peterkin says</i>: "Animals have 'second sight' and can see spirits, but only people born with cauls over their faces have this keen vision."<br> <i>Roll, Jordan, Roll, p. 206</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_4d"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">4d</FONT></A> <i>Beckwith says</i>: "The caul is also connected with sympathetic magic of a healing, rather than an injurious kind. It should be removed and carefully parched over a hot brick and a bit put into the baby's tea to prevent convulsions due to the irritation of a ghost."<br> <i>Black Roadways, p. 57</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_4e"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">4e</FONT></A> <i>Herskovits says of Haiti</i>: "A child born with a can] is believed to be strong in combating all evil spirits. The caul is dried and reduced to powder, and the infant is given some of the powder in water two or three days after birth."<br> <i>Life in a Haitian Valley, p. 95</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_4f"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">4f</FONT></A> <i>Herskovits says of Dahomey</i>: "A child born with a caul--'with a veil over its face'--who follows the first child after twins, is called, if a boy Wusu^, if a girl W&uacute;m&eacute;. The child born after such a one is called Wu^s&acirc; or Wuhw&ecirc;, according to sex. If the child with the caul does not follow the first child born after twins, then the names given are Kesu^ or Kes&icirc;; the child who follows one of these is called Kes&acirc;, if a boy. No special name is given a girl born immediately after a child with a caul."<br> <i>Dahomey, I, 264</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_5"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT></A>. CHARMS, MADE OF ANIMALS, INSECTS</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_5a"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">5a</FONT></A> <i>Herskovits says of Dahomey</i>: "Thus from the earth, from trees and shrubs, from rocks, and from the bodies of animals and humans the Dahomean obtains materials for his <i>gbo^</i>, while from the <i>Aziza&#0774;&#0808;&middot;</i> and other spirits of the forest, from L&#0949;gb&aacute;, the F&aacute; Group, Da&#0808;, and the Great Gods, he obtained knowledge of how to endow them with effective power."<br> <i>Dahomey</i>, II, <i>287</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_5b"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">5b</FONT></A> <i>Leonard says of West Africa</i>: "These are procured from or made with the spines of certain animals, porcupines more especially, compounded with potash, iron filings, and other inorganic</p> 
<p><a name="page_188"><font size="1" color="green">p. 188</font></A></p> 
<p>matters, which are reduced to a powder. In this form they are supposed to be communicated invisibly with such celerity and exactness against a person, that blood poisoning supervenes."<br> <i>The Lower Niger and Its Tribes, p. 500</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_5c"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">5c</FONT></A> <i>Melville and Frances Herskovits say of the Paramaribo Negro</i>: <i>Fiofio</i>, as envisaged in this belief, is the name of an insect and also of a spirit which, taking the shape of this insect, enters human bodies, causing illness and sometimes death. It comes as a result of family quarrelling which does not end in reconciliation. Strictly speaking, it is the extending of gestures of friendship or intimacy at a later date, when the bitterness of the quarrel has either passed or is masked, which brings on the illness. Such gestures of intimacy or friendship include accepting food that is offered, or a caress, or borrowing some kind of wearing apparel, or asking and receiving any other favor, and the resulting illness comes to either one or both of the persons who had participated in the quarrel."<br> <i>Suriname Folk-Lore, p. 53</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_6"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT></A>. CHARMS, COUNTER</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_6a"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">6a</FONT></A> <i>Farrow says of the Yoruba</i>: "The power of 'medicine' (<i>ogun</i>) exercised through a certain channel may be neutralised or overcome by a superior power of ogun through another channel. Van Gennep tells us that in Madagascar <i>fady</i> (the local name for 'taboo') may be broken by one who has a higher power known as <i>hasina</i>. So in Yoruba, a stronger 'medicine' is employed to overcome, or counteract, an evil one, or a curse incurred through a broken <i>ewo</i> ('taboo'). This is the explanation of the use of 'charms,' whether material (as amulets), vocal, or actionary. It is the invocation of a higher power, or a fuller measure of the same power."<br> <i>Faith, Fancies and Fetich, p. 121</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_6b"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">6b</FONT></A> <i>Herskovits says of Dahomey</i>: "S&uacute;kp&iacute;kpa^, <i>brings danger to another</i>. a. This <i>gbo^</i> is essentially a 'counter' against sorcery. Actually, it demonstrates the principle which will be developed at greater length in the succeeding pages, that the line between good magic and bad magic is difficult to determine, since evil can be done by a charm otherwise good, if it is directed toward an evil end, and good by an evil charm, if properly handled. This <i>gbo^</i> is called <i>agb&aacute;&#0807;ngba</i> 'outside'--and consists of a piece of wood first split in two, and then, after the ingredients are placed between the pieces, tied together with cord and fastened by passing the end through, and tying but not knotting it. One end is colored green. If a man who is strong in magic power is angry with the owner,</p> 
<p><a name="page_189"><font size="1" color="green">p. 189</font></A></p> 
<p>and it is deemed likely that an attempt may be made to kill him with magic, the owner takes this charm, inserts it in the ground near his house, puts a stone on top of it and the evil magic is thereby not only prevented from becoming effective, but any evil attempted will rebound on him who has sent it."<br> <i>Dahomey</i>, II, <i>269</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_6c"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">6c</FONT></A> <i>Melville and Frances Herskovits say of Dahomey</i>: "No matter how strong the magic, somewhere there is stronger magic which not only can overcome it, but may, in certain cases, turn back its effect on the person who invoked the original magic. This is true not only of evil charms, but of protective ones as well. Thus, we have in lengthy detail, information concerning a charm which a man buries in his field to protect it. Against this there is an evil 'counter' which will not only allow its user to steal from the field, but brings evil on the rightful owner. Against this bad magic there is, in turn, an elaborate 'counter-counter,' which brings the thief to book."<br> <i>An Outline of Dahomean Religious Belief, p. 65</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_7"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT></A>. CHARMS, FOOT-TRACK</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_7a"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">7a</FONT></A> <i>Puckett says of the Gold Coast</i>: "On the Gold Coast it is believed that a man may be harmed by a 'medicine' made from the dust picked up from his foot-tracks . . ."<br> <i>Folk Beliefs of the Southern Negro, p. 220</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_8"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT></A>. CHARMS, GENERAL</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_8a"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">8a</FONT></A> <i>Brown says of the Bantu tribes</i>: "As the Bechuana believe that no misfortune befalls one naturally, but is always the effect of malevolence on the part of the living or the dead, so they also strongly believe that good fortune can only be maintained by means of charms."<br> <i>Among the Bantu Nomads, p. 137</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_8b"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">8b</FONT></A> <i>Ellis says of the Ewe of West Africa</i>: "Magic powders are very numerous. One kind, when blown against a door or window, causes it to fly open, no matter how securely it may be fastened; another, when thrown upon the footprints of an enemy, makes him mad; a third, used in the same way, neutralizes the evil effects of the second; and a fourth destroys the sight of all who look upon it.</p> 
<p>"Magic unguents (iro) are not uncommon. They and the powders are obtained from the priests, and must be rubbed on the body of</p> 
<p><a name="page_190"><font size="1" color="green">p. 190</font></A></p> 
<p>the person who is to be influenced by them. Some are believed to compel a man to lend money, but their more common property is to constrain the unwilling fair to listen favourably to the amorous proposal."<br> <i>The Ewe-Speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast of West Africa, p. 94</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_8c"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">8c</FONT></A> <i>Herskovits says</i>: "In Dahomey magic charms are sold by professional workers of magic."<br> <i>Life in a Haitian Valley, p. 31</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_8d"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">8d</FONT></A> <i>Herskovits says of Dahomey</i>: "Magic charms form another type of personal property. As has been noted, these charms, which include herbs and other medicines, are held by tradition to have been revealed chiefly to hunters in the bush. When a hunter had learned how to make a given charm, or had been taught how to use a certain leaf to cure some disease, this knowledge was then his property and had salable value. When he was sought out for a charm to achieve a specific purpose--to protect a man on a journey, or to make of him a successful trader, or to insure the death of an enemy--if the hunter detailed the contents of the charm, how to put the ingredients together, the situation in which it would become effective and any formulae necessary to set it in operation, this knowledge then became the property of the purchaser as well as the vender. . . . To the professional dealers in charms, then, these comprise a stock in trade that is their property and potential wealth; for others, while the charms they own are property, they do not represent a source of income."<br> <i>Dahomey</i>, I, <i>81-82</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_8e"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">8e</FONT></A> <i>Kingsley says of West Africa</i>: "Charms are made for every occupation and desire in life-loving, hating, buying, selling, fishing, planting, travelling, hunting, etc."<br> <i>Travels in West Africa, p. 448</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_8f"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">8f</FONT></A> <i>Melville and Frances Herskovits say of the Suriname Negro</i>: "That is, people are spoken of as 'buying luck' or 'wearing luck,' and comments are heard about the importance of carrying one's 'luck' when walking alone at night, when going on a journey, when wooing a woman, or seeking work, or combating the effect of black magic."<br> <i>Suriname Folk-Lore, p. 99</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_8g"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">8g</FONT></A> <i>Nassau says of the Gabun territory</i>: "For every human passion or desire of every part of our nature, for our thousand necessities or wishes, a fetich can be made, its operations being directed to the attainment of one specified wish, and limited in power only</p>

<p>by the possible existence of some more powerful antagonizing spirits."<br> <i>Fetichism in West Africa, p. 85</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_8h"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">8h</FONT></A> <i>Talbot says of the Ibibio tribes</i>: "Ibokk are, for the most part, made for defensive purposes, for protection against ill-wishers or evil messengers, but are sometimes procured from 'doctors' to harm an enemy."<br> <i>Life in Southern Nigeria, p. 21</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_8i"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">8i</FONT></A> "There is what may be termed a 'white art' as well as a 'black art,' and the great majority of fetiches and charms are intended to protect from evil, and not to attack innocent folk."<br> <i>The Geographical Journal</i>, XXXI, <i>607</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_9"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT></A>. CHARMS, GRAVEYARD DIRT</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_9a"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">9a</FONT></A> <i>Pearce says of West Africa</i>: "Juju bags containing graveyard dirt and other material which had had a spell put upon it by juju are effective for either good or evil purposes. A bag of this sort worn around the neck, as a Catholic wears a scapula, serves as a protection from the spells of enemies. However, if a man wishes to work evil on his enemy, he may purchase a juju bag containing evil powder, and through it cast a spell on his enemy."<br> (Interview)</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_10"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT></A>. CHARMS, HAIR AND NAILS</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_10a"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">10a</FONT></A> <i>Ellis says of the Ewe</i>: "Hence it is usual for pieces of hair and nails to be carefully buried or burned, in order that they may not fall into the hands of sorcerers; and whenever a king or chief expectorates, the saliva is carefully gathered up and hidden or buried."<br> <i>The Ewe-Speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast of West Africa, p. 99</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_10b"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">10b</FONT></A> <i>Meek says of the Jukun</i>: "Sorcerers also capture and injure or kill souls in a variety of ways, notably by acting on the hair, nail-parings or excreta of a person, the soul substance being regarded as immanent in these. If a person wishes to injure another he has merely to obtain a piece of his enemy's nails and hand them to a sorcerer, who, if he knows his work, will speedily cause the death of the former owner of the nail-parings. For this reason a Jukun always hides or buries his hair and nail cuttings. Some Jukun burn these, but others would refrain from doing this on the ground that the burning would cause a scorching of his soul."<br> <i>A Sudanese Kingdom, p. 298</i>.</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_10c"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">10c</FONT></A> <i>Milligan says of the Mpongwe</i>: "The parings of fingernails, the hair of the victim and such things are powerful ingredients in these 'medicines.' An Mpongwe, after having his hair cut, gathers up every hair most carefully and burns it lest an enemy should secure it and use it to his injury. When sickness continues for a length of time they usually conclude that some offended relation has caused an evil spirit to abide in the town."<br> <i>The Fetish Folk of West Africa, p. 39</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_10d"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">10d</FONT></A> <i>Nassau says of the Bantu</i>: "So fearful are natives of power being thus obtained over them, that they have their hair cut only by a friend; and even then they carefully burn it or cast it into a river."<br> <i>Fetichism in West Africa, p. 83</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_10e"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">10e</FONT></A> <i>Nassau says of the Benga, the Mpongwe, and the Fang</i>: "If it be desired to obtain power over some one else, the oganga must be given by the applicant, to be mixed in the sacred compound, either crumbs from the food, or clippings of finger nails or hair, or (most powerful!) even a drop of blood of the person over whom influence is sought. These represent the life or body of that person."<br> <i>Fetichism in West Africa, p. 83</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_10f"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">10f</FONT></A> <i>Nassau says of the Banita region</i>: "Sitting one day by a village boat-landing in the Banita region, about 1866, while my crew prepared for our journey, I was idly plucking at my beard, and carelessly flung away a few hairs. Presently I observed that some children gathered them up. Asking my Christian assistant what that meant, he told me: 'They will have a fetich made with those hairs; when next you visit this village, they will ask you for some favor, and you will grant it, by the power they will thus have over you."<br> <i>Fetichism in West Africa, p. 83</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_10g"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">10g</FONT></A> <i>Nassau says of the West Coast natives</i>: "Lately a fellow missionary told me that in a conversation with certain natives, professed Christians, they admitted their fear lest their nail-clippings should be used against them by an enemy, and candidly acknowledged that when they pared their nails they threw the pieces on the thatch of the low roof of their house."<br> <i>Fetichism in West Africa, p. 104</i>.</p>

Ofuo Afaba Eke, sworn, stated: 'Tomkpata is my elder brother, I complained to him that my mother had dreamed a dream in which she saw him cut off her hair with scissors.

Others, for the protection of property, are fastened to houses, or tied to sticks and stumps of trees in cultivated plots of ground. In consequence of their being tied on to the person or object they protect, the word <i>edi</i>, which really means the act of tying or binding, has now the meaning of amulet or charm, just as in Ew&#0780;e the word <i>vo&#0834;&#0780;-sesa</i> (amulet) is derived from <i>vo&#0834;&#0780;</i> and <i>sa</i>, to tie or bind."<br> <i>The Yoruba-Speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast of West Africa, p. 118</i>.</p>

So, too, a girl or woman who through excessive shyness is too coy to dance in public, develops, when under the influence of the Owu, an excess of boldness, which enables her to do things that under ordinary conditions she would not dream of doing. This boldness is to these natives merely the confirmation of a pre-existing conviction that it is not the person that is doing these things but the spirit who has invaded and obsessed her.</p>

This Restraint is not laid upon them for a limited time, but for their whole Lives: And if the Romanists brag of the Antiquities of their Ecclesiastical Commands; so if you ask the Negroes why they do this, they will readily tell you, because their Ancestors did so from the beginning of the World and it hath been handed down from one Age to another by Tradition. The Son never eats what the Father is restrained from, as the Daughter herein follows the Mother's Example; and this Rule is as strictly observed amongst them, that 'tis impossible to persuade them to the contrary."<br> <i>Description of the Coast of Guinea, pp. 154-55</i>.</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_65c"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">65c</FONT></A> <i>Ellis says of the Ewe</i>: "The usual reverence is paid by the members of a clan to the animal or plant from which the clan takes its name. It may not be used as food, or molested in any way; but must always be treated with veneration and respect. The general notion is that the members of the clan are directly descended from the animal, or plant, eponymous."<br> <i>The Ewe-Speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast of West Africa, p. 100</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_65d"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">65d</FONT></A> <i>Ellis says of the Tshi</i>: "With some races the reverence originally felt for the deceased ancestor, and in later times transferred to the animal for which he was named, culminates in the animal being regarded as a tutelary deity, and consequently a being to be worshipped and propitiated by sacrifice; but in other cases-and this is almost always the case with the family divisions of the natives of the Gold Coast-an abstention from the use of the flesh of the animal whose name the family bears, is sometimes the only remaining sign of any feeling of reverence or respect."<br> <i>The Tshi-Speaking Peoples of the Gold Coast of West Africa, p. 206</i>.</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_66b"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">66b</FONT></A> <i>Thomas says of the Ibo of Nigeria</i>: "Not only twins, but many other children are, or were, exposed because of some circumstance connected with their birth or development. For example, a child born with teeth is regarded as a monster who will bring misfortune on its father-perhaps the belief may be that it will devour him. . . ."<br> <i>Anthropological Report on the Ibo-Speaking Peoples of Nigeria</i>, I, <i>pp. 10-11</i>.</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_67a"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">67a</FONT></A> <i>Melville and Frances Herskovits say of the Suriname Negro</i>: "Twins, and the child born after twins, who is called <i>Dosu</i>, and children born feet foremost, are in a category by themselves, and they are often spoken of as <i>&#0596;gri</i>. . . . bad."<br> <i>Suriname Folk-Lore, p. 42</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_67b"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">67b</FONT></A> <i>Meek says of Nigeria</i>: "And twins were allowed to die or were deliberately killed by being enclosed in a pot or ant-hill. For the Ibo hold the common belief that the birth of twins is an indication of the disfavour of the spirits, and a punishment, possibly of adultery. Twin-births are regarded as non-human, and it is a common belief that the chi or accompanying soul of a twin is the chi of an animal. After the birth of twins a diviner is consulted to ascertain which spirit or ancestor had been offended, and sacrifice is offered to appease his wrath."<br> <i>Law and Authority in a Nigerian Tribe, p. 291</i>.</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_68a"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">68a</FONT></A> <i>Herskovits says of Dahomey</i>: "The <i>az&#0596;&#0808;ndato</i>, as such practitioners are called, are spoken of in whispers, and are said to be organized into a close guild. They exercise power over the souls of those who have not had proper burial and therefore wander about the earth discontented, and over these souls procured by 'killing' their owners in the manner described above. These <i>az&#0596;&#0808;ndato</i> are to be recognized by their blood-shot eyes, and Dahomeans stealthily point out two or three such persons in the market-place who usually may be remarked to be doing somewhat better business than those who sit near them. These dangerous individuals change into bats at night, or assume other animal forms and go forth to hold council together or to perform their dark deeds."<br> <i>Dahomey</i>, II, <i>287</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_68b"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">68b</FONT></A> <i>Meek says of Nigeria</i>: "Witches (<i>amozu</i>) and wizards (<i>ogboma</i>) have also animal counterparts, and so assume the forms of owls, lizards, vultures, and numerous species of night-birds. Consequently, if a night-bird comes and rests on a house, the owner loses no time in trying to drive it away or shoot it; and if he fails he will seize his <i>ofo</i> and call on his ancestors or any local deity to rid him of his enemy. A witch always assails at night. By magic means she attacks the throat, so that the victim is paralysed and cannot move or speak, and in the morning may be found lying senseless and naked outside his hut. . . . Witches can penetrate into a house through the smallest cracks in the wall, and can assume the form of the smallest insect. Flies and other creatures which bite are witches or the agents of witches, and if a person is severely bitten he may consult a diviner, who will order the patient to offer sacrifice to propitiate some witch, and induce the witch to remove the spell by transferring it to some one else. Witches can poison food or infect it with sorcery, and if any one eats a meal cooked by a witch he will become seriously ill or die. Mothers,</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_68e"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">68e</FONT></A> <i>Farrow says</i>: "The witch-doctor is, of course, a privileged person. He is called in to trace the source of disease and death, for these are generally attributed to witchcraft, unless they are evidently caused by the vengeance of Shopono (smallpox), Shango, or some similar deity. Various forms of disease are described as 'snakes inside' (<i>ejo-inu</i>), 'an insect' (<i>kokoro</i>), etc., and it is supposed that these have been introduced by a foe through the agency of witchcraft."<br> <i>Faith, Fancies and Fetish, p. 125</i>.</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_69a"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">69a</FONT></A> <i>Ellis says of the Vais</i>: "There is a belief, as I have stated, among the Vais that witches come to your house and ride you at night,--that when the witch comes in the door he takes off his skin and lays it aside in the house. It is believed that he returns you to the Ned where he found you, and that the witch may be killed by sprinkling salt and pepper in certain portions of the room, which will prevent the witch from putting on his skin. Just before they go to bed it is a common thing to see Vais people sprinkling salt and pepper about the room."<br> <i>Negro Culture in West Africa, p. 63</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_69b"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">69b</FONT></A> <i>Leonard says</i>: "In Brass the natives firmly believe that witches exist, and that certain persons by natural operations--or rather by co-operation with natural forces--possess the power of inflicting disease, injury, or death upon their neighbours. These individuals are divided into two classes--the harmful and the harmless.</p> 
<p>"The former are said to go out of their houses at night, and to hold meetings with demons and their colleagues, to determine whose life is next to be destroyed. This is done by gradually sucking the blood of the victim through some supernatural and invisible</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_70a"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">70a</FONT></A> <i>Herskovits says</i>: "In West Africa, the development of techniques of all kinds is the greatest on the continent. The Benin bronzes, the brass-work of Dahomey, the weaving of the Ashanti, or the wood carving of the Ivory Coast, Dahomey, and Nigeria are famous, while pottery of a high grade, basketry, and iron work are found everywhere."<br> <i>Social History of the Negro, p. 221</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_70b"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">70b</FONT></A> <i>Herskovits says of the Bush Negro</i>: "In the villages of the Bush Negroes the artist holds an enviable position, and the good carver is sought after in marriage and often wins the most desirable young woman for his wife. This is because Suriname woodcarving is a part of all phases of life."<br> <i>Social History of the Negro, p. 247</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_70c"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">70c</FONT></A> <i>Herskovits says of Dahomey</i>: "But, as stated, the greatest proportion of objects are intended for some specific end. The spotted hyena, for example, formed a handle for the staff of a chief. The two wands with human figures on them are employed in the F&aacute; cult. The three figures in the background of the same plate, representing a woman, an animal, and a bird respectively, support cups which hold the seeds employed in the Fate cult.<br> <i>Dahomey</i>, II, <i>370</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_70d"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">70d</FONT></A> "Wood-carving is the most democratic, and the most widely practiced, of all the arts. It constitutes the one mode of artistic expression open to all men in Dahomey, for, as in many cultures, wood-carving is not a technique permitted to women. In addition, however, to the democratic nature of the art it pervades the daily life of the people to a greater degree than any other art-form, and a catalogue of the uses to which the objects carved in wood are put by the Dahomeans would touch upon all elements of Dahomean culture. Carvings thus catalogued would range from the artistic</p>

<p>statuettes found in the shrines of the gods and the smaller human figures used as <i>gbo^</i>, the beautifully carved cups which hold the palm-kernels employed in the F&aacute; cult, and the carefully worked handles of the X&#0949;vioso axes, all of which indicate the association of wood-carving with religion, to the mortars, stools, and other decorated objects used in the everyday round of life."<br> <i>Dahomey</i>, II, <i>363</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_70e"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">70e</FONT></A> "Among these forms are plastic and graphic arts, music, dancing and a wide range of oral literature. In the former group woodcarving is the most widespread and the most commonly practised. As will be indicated in detail below, carvings in wood enter many phases of life. Statues of the gods, human forms which, as gbo^, protect the owner and his household, and the implements of the Fate cult, are all a part of the religious life. The sceptres of King and chiefs, and the elaborately carved stools on which they sat were indispensable symbols of rank and succession. The wands of office and stools of sib-chiefs associate this art with social organisation, especially where the totem animal is figured, while even the <i>adj&iacute;</i> game-boards of the Dahomeans are embellished by the carvings of the artist."<br> <i>Dahomey</i>, II, <i>311</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_70f"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">70f</FONT></A> <i>Melville and Frances Herskovits say of the Bush Negro of Dutch Guiana</i>: "There were other carvings which we bought-a large rice-carrying tray, and some food stirrers, one of which was especially fine, made as it was of two small paddles with miniature blades, the handles joined by a wooden ring-chain, and all of this carved out of one piece of wood."<br> <i>Rebel Destiny, p. 277</i>.</p> 
<p><A NAME="xref_70g"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">70g</FONT></A> "Few things on the river seemed to the outsiders more characteristic of the life of the Saramacca people than these carvings which were met with everywhere, however small the village, however poor the home. When the seasonal rains came, men incised their desires on wood, which later told the legend of procreation, or safety on the river, or a curse invoked against a woman if she proved unfaithful; or something of humor, such as a man bidding for a girl's favor, and she refusing him, while up above intertwined were a man and woman, symbolizing the ultimate consummation with the proper suitor."<br> <i>Rebel Destiny, pp. 277-78</i>.</p>
