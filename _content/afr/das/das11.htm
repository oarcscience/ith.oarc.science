<p>Brownville, more prosperous of aspect than the Negro communities usually fringing business and industry, spreads westward along the edge of Savannah. Though on its Currytown boundary it, too, contains the inevitable shacks in lanes, several of its streets, paved and tree shaded, are lined with good frame and brick houses which are occupied by the more well-to-do Negroes, among them teachers, doctors, lawyers, and business men. A substantial school building and the Charity Hospital speak of advanced social consciousness.</p> 
<p>On Bismark Street is found the House of Prayer, one of the many churches established throughout the country by Bishop Grace. Here several times each year the leader visits his congregation, and the day on which "Daddy Grace"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="#fn_46"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_16"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">16</FONT></A> returns to his flock is always a gala occasion. Regular members and visitors from outlying districts crowd the heavy lumber benches of the House of Prayer. The air is tense with excitement. Above the confusion can be heard the strident but rhythmic beat of drums.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_23"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">23</FONT></A> Bright splashes of color are given by the crepe paper decorations and the vividly contrasting military costumes of members of the church organizations, among which are the Lilies of the Valley, the Queens, the Royal Guards, the Silver Leaf Band, the Transportation Committee, Male Ushers No. 1, Male Ushers No. 2, and the Sons and Daughters of the Prophet. Others in the</p>

<p><a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="green">p. 44</font></A></p> 
<p>congregation don their newest and most colorful garments.</p> 
<p>Preparation has been made for all emergencies. In attendance are burly guards whose duty it is to see that nothing occurs to disturb the smooth performance of the ceremonies. The floor has been thickly sprinkled with sawdust and the stout posts at the front of the church are padded to prevent injury to overzealous worshipers.</p> 
<p>At the sudden sharp sound of a whistle all activity ceases; there is silence in the church. The Armor Bearers leave the building to escort the Bishop to his seat of honor. Soon they return, followed by the Queen who is arrayed in a pate green satin evening dress over which is worn a black velvet cape lined with scarlet. A double line of uniformed guards follows, and marching proudly between the lines is the Bishop. According to his own statement, the Holy Prophet, as his followers call him, is of Portuguese birth. His long dark hair which falls to his shoulders, his piercing eyes, his pointed beard, and sideburns all combine to give him a distinguished and unusual appearance.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_47"></A><A HREF="#fn_47"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p> 
<p>The procession continues to the front of the church, where, with much ceremony, the Bishop seats himself upon a lofty throne set far back on the spacious platform. The Queen stands at the Bishop's right, facing the congregation. The music blares forth with renewed intensity and the entire</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p><a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="green">p. 45</font></A></p> 
<p>multitude, led by the uniformed guard, passes in single file before the throne. As members approach the Bishop, they pledge themselves to him by removing their hats and bowing low. In the midst of all this commotion "Daddy" sits, a remote, detached figure, his downcast eyes seemingly indicating that he is scarcely aware of this carefully planned reception.</p> 
<p>Between the musical numbers several of the congregation rise and loudly testify to the miracles that Bishop Grace&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_22"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">22</FONT></A> has performed in their behalf. A flourishing sale is conducted in consecrated handkerchiefs and copies of a newspaper published by the cult. These are believed to possess unusual healing powers.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_8"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>,&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_12"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> A ready market is also found for large pictures of the Bishop, for it is said that to chew up his likeness will cure many kinds of illness.</p> 
<p>The grand march is spectacular. All those present assemble in the large center aisle. The band strikes up a lively measure and the procession starts. At the front of the church the line of march divides, half the people going down one side aisle, the other half going down the opposite one. At first the procession is orderly and fairly quiet, but as time passes, the music becomes increasingly loud. Above the brass instruments the steady throb of the drum can be heard. Voices are raised in accompaniment, feet stamp, shoulders sway, and hands clap.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_19"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">19</FONT></A></p> 
<p>Around and around the procession winds. The singing and dancing become wilder and more abandoned. Many now close their eyes, dancing blindly and stumbling into those near them and into the benches and posts. By this time the music is almost deafening and the noise made by the worshipers is equally loud. The muscles of their bodies twitching convulsively, they continue in their dance.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_46"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">46</FONT></A></p> 
<p>Occasionally one of the participants stops, and, regardless of the hindrance to the rest of the worshipers, jumps up and down wildly, crying out in a shrill, hysterical voice. At length, exhausted, he sinks to the floor and is dragged by friends from under the whirling feet of the others.</p> 
<p>One woman, seized by such a paroxysm, falls to her knees, screaming incoherently. Exhausted by her violent emotion, she lies on the rough board floor, her jaws hanging open</p> 
<p><a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="green">p. 46</font></A></p> 
<p>loosely, her eyes closed. Slowly, she raises her hands and beats them together muttering, "Praise Daddy. Praise Daddy Grace."</p> 
<p>The pulsating rhythm of the instruments increases in tempo. A man leaps high into the air, gesticulating and babbling; faster and faster he whirls, until he too falls from utter exhaustion. Still the wild display continues. The terrific nervous strain is taking its toll, and now all but a few of the dancers stumble wearily. The steady, insistent sound of the drum urges them on; feet still shuffle, hands beat out the rhythm, and voices chant an incoherent incantation.</p> 
<p>Abruptly the band ceases and members straggle back to their places. Those who have fallen out from exhaustion are dragged to the benches by their friends.</p> 
<p>The service continues. During the evening many collections are taken up. Two of the deacons, acting on behalf of the Bishop, urge the people to contribute freely. Their methods of approach present a strong contrast. One, stout, dark-skinned, and clad in a pearl gray suit, has a gentle and persuasive manner. He says softly to the congregation, "Precious Haht, hep us tuh raise fawty bucks fuh Daddy Grace right quick. Wile duh Prophet sits on duh throne befo us, let us all contribute freely tuh him."</p> 
<p>The other deacon, short and wiry, darts about among the congregation. His manner of speaking is quick, and he barks his orders to first one and then another of the church members. "Step right up now," he advises. "Dohn hole back on us. Anybody else now, come right up an contribute. Ebrybody gib at leas one nickel now wile we still hab duh privilege uh gibin tuh Daddy. Step up, ebrybody."</p> 
<p>Until this point Bishop Grace, apparently indifferent, has had no active part in the ceremony, but he now steps forward. There is a sudden hush.</p> 
<p>"Daddy" becomes an intimate, vivid part of the group. Coming down among the congregation, he addresses his talk now to one individual, now to another, dropping frequently into the southern Negro dialect. The theme of his address is, "Whatsoever a man soweth, that also shall he reap." The main issue, however, is often sidetracked, and the speaker comments in turn upon world politics, the war, anecdotes of</p> 
<p><a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="green">p. 47</font></A></p> 
<p>his own trips abroad, his persecution by enemies, all of whom "the Lord struck down dead," and the general condition of the local community. The entire discourse is interspersed with humorous sayings that find a delighted response. "Daddy" advises his followers strongly against trusting anyone. "If the angel from Heaven comes down an wants an extra pair of wings, don't trust him," he warns. "Tell him you ain't got no time to keep books today. He have to pay cash." Near the conclusion of his talk the Bishop says that be can accomplish anything he chooses, even to sinking ships, destroying fleets of planes, or conquering entire nations. He is not the actual power, he says, but he is so close to it that he has only to reach out his hand and pull the switch.</p> 
<p>After every sentence or two that "Daddy" utters his listeners echo his statements with such remarks as "Ain't it so, Daddy," "Dat is duh trute," "Yes Daddy," "You tell em, Daddy," "Hallelujah," "Amen." These utterances, do not always agree with what the speaker has just said but nevertheless are meant to express thorough approbation. At one time "Daddy" tosses to a woman in the congregation a rose he has used in illustrating a point in his sermon. This unexpected honor overcomes the recipient to such an extent that she is seized with violent convulsions.</p> 
<p>Noticing that the hour is growing late, the Bishop abruptly ends his talk. There follows a prayer, led by one of the deacons and chanted rather than spoken. At the end of each line the man's voice catches on a high sob verging on hysteria, and those in the congregation murmur an almost inaudible echo of the speaker's plea. The other deacons join in the recital and in the wild sobbing. At the conclusion of the prayer a high pitch of excitement is reached.</p> 
<p>It is now time for the Bishop to take leave of his flock. Slowly, reverently, his attendants bring him his top coat and high Stetson hat. From his pocket "Daddy" draws out a large white handkerchief which he waves slowly in accompaniment to the closing hymn, a corrupt version of <i>Nearer My God To Thee</i>. The worshipers, too, wave their handkerchiefs in solemn tribute to their departing leader.</p> 
<p>Shortly after a visit from the Bishop we pursued our course</p> 
<p><a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="green">p. 48</font></A></p> 
<p>of research in Brownville. We found a number of people who had been named for week days or the month in which they had been born. Thursday Jones,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="#fn_48"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> when questioned about this particular custom, replied, "Dey name me dat way jis cuz uh happen tuh be bawn on Tursday, I guess. Sech tings seem tuh be in our fambly. I hab an uncle whose name is Monday Collins. It seem tuh come duh fus ting tuh folks' mine tuh name duh babies fuh duh day dey is bawn on."&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_20"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">20</FONT></A></p> 
<p>Another man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> told us, "We hab membuhs in our fambly name Monday, Friday, July an Augus. Dey jis didn tink ub any name tuh call em but duh day dey wuz bawn.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_20"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">20</FONT></A> Deah wuz two brudduhs call July an Augus an deah two sons wuz name aftuh um. Some uh deze names go all duh way back tuh slabery time. Duh chillun jis name aftuh duh kin."</p> 
<p>"Ise quainted wid two ole men, one call Uncle Friday, duh othuh Uncle July," was the statement of a third Brownville resident.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_50"></A><A HREF="#fn_50"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> "One wuz bawn on Good Friday an duh othuh on duh Foth uh July."&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_20"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">20</FONT></A></p> 
<p>We learned that certain foods are viewed with suspicion and are never eaten or allowed to be brought into the house.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_65"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">65</FONT></A> The exact reason why these foods are forbidden was not explained to us. One woman said, "One ting I do lak is peanuts, but I dohn eat um. An I dohn let nobody else eat um in muh house. I dohn know jis wy, but it bring bad luck all duh week."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_51"></A><A HREF="#fn_51"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p> 
<p>The palmetto tree, Robert McNichols&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> told us, supplies an edible substance in the form of palmetto cabbage taken from the center of the tree, about a foot below the top. This is the terminal bud of the tree, white in color, tender, and resembling the ordinary northern cabbage. It may be eaten cooked or uncooked.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_45a"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">45a</FONT></A></p> 
<p>From the same tree a wine is made. We learned two different recipes for the preparation of this beverage. The wine is sometimes made from the cabbage, which when first cut contains a white sap. The chopped cabbage is put in a container</p> 
<p>

<p>where it is allowed to ferment, after which it is strained and sugar added.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_45b"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">45b</FONT></A> The wine may also be made from the dark blue palmetto berries. These are placed in a container until fermentation occurs after which the juice is extracted and sweetened. The wine is a clear dark brown and is said to have an excellent flavor. Incidentally, the palmetto tree serves a variety of other purposes. Palmetto fibre is used in making baskets, rugs, bottle holders, and numerous other objects.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_45"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">45</FONT></A></p> 
<p>Many of the Brownville residents are skilled in palmetto weaving and also in woodcarving. Walking sticks were brought to our attention. One had a lizard carved on its handle,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> while the likeness of a snake twisted its body realistically about the length of the stick.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_50"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">50</FONT></A>, &nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_70a"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">70a</FONT></A>-h On a similar stick of dull, yellowish wood the tense, erect head of the large reptile which wrapped itself about the cane formed the handle.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_50"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">50</FONT></A> In the gaping mouth was held a ball. Even the smallest detail had been delicately and artistically executed. We could learn little of the history of the stick except that it had been carved many years ago by an old Negro who had given it to the present owner and soon afterward moved away from the section.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_55"></A><A HREF="#fn_55"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> The snake decorating&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_50"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">50</FONT></A> a third cane had eyes of rhinestones&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_41c"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">41c</FONT></A> which gleamed and flashed as the stick was moved about.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_56"></A><A HREF="#fn_56"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p> 
<p>Crude hand-carved wooden table utensils were in use in several households.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_70a"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">70a</FONT></A>-h We were shown a fork with only two prongs set wide apart on the far sides of the base. One of the Spoons was about the size of an average tablespoon, but with a bowl of considerably greater depth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_57"></A><A HREF="#fn_57"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p> 
<p>One Negro showed much ingenuity in the carving of a linked chain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_58"></A><A HREF="#fn_58"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> with a box-like object attached. inside the box was a small wooden ball. This entire contraption had been made from one solid piece of wood.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_70f"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">70f</FONT></A>-h Another man employed his spare time in the carving of small wooden</p>

<p>An old Negro living in very poor circumstances owned a number of interesting objects.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_60"></A><A HREF="#fn_60"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> These he said he had inherited from a grandfather who had come to this country from Santo Domingo, West Indies. Among the objects were old coins, a pistol, and a pocketbook made of shells clamped together with metal bands. The most significant item, however, was a carved stone fig. The grainy texture and the slight splits in the skin had been executed with great skill. The fig had been carried as a charm by the old man's ancestor, but where this forebear had obtained it we were unable to learn.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_8"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>, &nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_32"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">32</FONT></A>, &nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_34c"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">34c</FONT></A></p> 
<p>On the Ogeechee Road not far from Brownville we came in contact with a Negro&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_61"></A><A HREF="#fn_61"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> whose favorite pastime was carving.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_70a"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">70a</FONT></A> He showed us the figure of a man, about twenty-seven inches high, with heavy shoulders and torso overbalancing the lower part of the figure. The head was large and square, the eyes were painted on roughly, and the nose and mouth were attached pieces of wood. A wooden crane and other birds carved by the same man bore a crude, primitive stamp.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_70c"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">70c</FONT></A>, &nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_70d"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">70d</FONT></A>, &nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_70g"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">70g</FONT></A></p> 
<p>Near by on the Ogeechee Road we found Tony William Delegal,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_62"></A><A HREF="#fn_62"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> an old man, well over one hundred years old, who was formerly a slave of Major John Thomas, Harris Neck, plantation owner. His dark eyes are filmed, his once powerful shoulders are bent, but Uncle Tony can still recall incidents which took place during his childhood on the plantation. Sitting on the front porch of his daughter's house, he sang an African song to us. Unfortunately he did not know the English translation. The old man sang the song over and over and we were finally able to take down the following:</p> 
<p>

<p>In the heart of the thriving Brownville community live fortune tellers, root doctors, and vendors of magic charms who conduct flourishing businesses.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_22a"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">22a</FONT></A>, &nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_22e"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">22e</FONT></A>, &nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_48"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">48</FONT></A> There is a ready market for their wares which are used for the various activities of daily living. Numerous perplexities pertaining to. matters of business, luck, and love affairs are thought to be solved by the mere possession of certain charms.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_8"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p> 
<p>Mattie Sampson,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_63"></A><A HREF="#fn_63"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> a robust young Negro woman, told us that she does an active mail order business as representative of the Lucky Heart Company, the Sweet Georgia Brown Company, and the Curio Products Company. She supports herself comfortably by means of selling her credulous neighbors good luck perfumes, roots, lodestones, and similar charms. "Duh chahms an good luck puhfumes an powduhs do deah wuk independent of any additional hep," Mattie said. "Ef anybody believe a puticuluh chahm is wut dey need, well, dat chahm will do duh wuk."</p> 
<p>"Mos of muh customuhs depen on special chahms tuh bring em good luck," the young woman continued. "Dey nevuh puhmit deah supply tuh give out but awduh it ovuh an ovuh. I have sevral bes selluhs.

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> In every box is five diffunt culluhs, each one fuh a diffunt puhpose." From a box which Mattie had on hand we took down the directions: "Work the magic spell now. Just hold <i>Mystic Mojo</i> in hand and light match to tip. Perfumed with rare fragrance and exotic sandalwood, myrrh and incense. Price 25&cent;. Sweet and strong."</p> 
<p>Mattie also constantly reorders a product known as <i>Magnetic Lodestone in Holy Oil</i>. "Dis is used," she explained, "tuh drive away evil spirits an bad luck an tuh bring yuh luck in love, an business, an gamblin games. Den deah's <i>Five Finguh Grass</i>. A lot uh duh people heah are sked of witches an spirits visitin em at night. Dey hang <i>Five Finguh Grass</i> ovuh deah bed aw doeway tuh protec duh whole house." Some of em use <i>Black Cat Incense an Powduh</i>."</p> 
<p>A few blocks from Mattie Sampson lives William Edwards&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_64"></A><A HREF="#fn_64"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> who follows the diverse trades of root doctor,&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_48"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">48</FONT></A> piano tuner, and watchman at a filling station. For a while the old man stubbornly insisted that, although he had been a popular root doctor in his younger days, he had not treated a patient in years. After a good deal of casual friendly conversation, he at length admitted that he was at present doctoring a man who had malaria. He also admitted that he was treating a cousin for an ailment and said that by the use of roots he had recently cured another patient of kidney trouble.</p> 
<p>"Muh roots kin cuo mos any pains," he said earnestly. "I wuks on dogs too. I kin cuo a mad dog in lessn a day ef dey git tuh me in time. I make muh medicine frum King Physics. It grows on duh salts an is bery plentiful neah Montgomery, but yuh hab tuh know how tuh fine it.</p>

<p>Another root doctor&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_65"></A><A HREF="#fn_65"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in the section told us that he had been born with a special knowledge of healing and had studied the science of herbs from the time he was a small boy.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_48"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">48</FONT></A> Some of the herbs he uses in his mixtures are Golden Seal, Yellow Dust, Golden Thread, Hippo Root, Pink Root, Lady Slipper, Yellow Root, Blood Root, Rattlesnake Master, Black Snake Root, and John the Conqueror.</p> 
<p>"I know in a dream," he said, "jis wen a patient is comin to consult me an I know head uh time zackly wut kine uh herbs tuh gadduh in awduh tuh cuo im."</p> 
<p>He had been born with this power to foretell the future, he asserted.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_22a"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">22a</FONT></A>, &nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_22e"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">22e</FONT></A> "Outside uh dreams," he went on, "I kin use leaves an coffee grouns an a suttn kine uh seed known as duh sensitive aw jumpin seed.

<p>Conjure is being practiced all the time, the root doctor informed us. "Frawgs an lizuds an sech tings is injected intuh people's bodies an duh people den fall ill an sometime die.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_5"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>,&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_15"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> Udduh strange tings is happenin, too.

<p>A woman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_66"></A><A HREF="#fn_66"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> informant, too, had heard about flying Africans and persons who could disappear at will.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_69c"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">69c</FONT></A> She said also that she had often been ridden by witches. "Dey seem tuh come frum. noweah an staht chokin yuh.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_69"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">69</FONT></A> Witches an root men hab duh same magic powuh."</p> 
<p>Relative to the custom of placing food and possessions on a new grave this woman spoke earnestly. "Dis wuz a common ting wen I wuz young. Dey use tuh put duh tings a pusson use las on duh grabe.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_47"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">47</FONT></A> Dis wuz suppose tuh satisfy duh spirit an keep it frum followin yuh back tuh duh house, I knowd a uhmun at Burroughs wut use tuh carry food tuh uh daughtuh grabe ebry day.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_58"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">58</FONT></A> She would take a basket uh cooked food, cake, pies, an wine.

<p>Another woman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_67"></A><A HREF="#fn_67"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> told us that on holidays she carried food to her husband's grave and left it there for the spirit to come and get.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_58"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">58</FONT></A> "I carry duh kine uh food we use tuh hab tuh eat on duh days be wuz off frum wuk," she said.

<p>"Ebuh since I kin membuh I hab heahd bout spirits wanduhin roun at night,"&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_59"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">59</FONT></A> she continued. "Muh mothuh nebuh</p>

Wen a ghos is roun I kin feel duh hot eah."</p> 
<p>We found that belief in supernatural beings such as witches and ghosts was widespread throughout the community.</p> 
<p>"Witches is lak folks," one woman said.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_68"></A><A HREF="#fn_68"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> "Dey done sell demsefs tuh duh debil an he make em do anyting he wants tuh.

Wen she see she wuz caught, she beg duh man not tuh do nuttn tuh uh an she wouldn nebuh do no mo witchin."</p> 
<p>A Negro preacher&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_69"></A><A HREF="#fn_69"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in a near by section said that he had been in the habit of seeing ghosts all his life.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_56"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">56</FONT></A>,&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_59"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">59</FONT></A> "Once wuz jis aftuh muh fathuh died.

<p>"Aftuh I marry I moob out by duh watuh wuks. A frien uh mine name Arthur Perry die. Some time latuh anothuh frien die. One night I wuz lyin down wen I heah a noise.

I see ghos mos any time, so Ise used to it now."</p> 
<p>That he was frequently visited by both witches and ghosts was the assertion of another man.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_70"></A><A HREF="#fn_70"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> "Duh witches come in an strangle me,"&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_69"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">69</FONT></A> he said, "but duh ghos yuh jis see, an no</p>

<p>The same man said considerable conjuring was being practiced in the neighborhood, but that he kept a careful distance from people who were believed to be able to "do tings tuh yuh."&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_15"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">15</FONT></A></p> 
<p>"Yuh see," he volunteered, "I hab muh leg fix once. Dat wuz back in 1893. Fus muh foot swell up, den muh leg. It wuz so bad I couldn walk. A man tole me tuh go tuh Doctuh Buzzud, a root doctuh.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_48"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">48</FONT></A> Doctuh Buzzud gimme some root medicine an in no time I wuz all right."&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_6"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p> 
<p>A more recent case of attempted conjure was told us by the woman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_71"></A><A HREF="#fn_71"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> who had been the intended victim.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_15"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> We found her living in new quarters where she had hurriedly moved to escape the evil influences directed towards her by the downstairs tenants in her former residence. Stout and middle-aged, she had not yet recovered from her fright at the time she was interviewed. As she talked, her dark eyes rolled wildly and her manner betrayed signs of extreme agitation.</p> 
<p>"Dem folks wuz detuhmined tuh git muh spirit. Ef dey do dat, den I go crazy an nobody could hep me. Dey hab a' dog trained wut would git unduh muh winduh an bahk twice tuh git me tuh look out. Ise on tuh em an uh stay shut in muh ruhm. Den dey would blow a automobile hawn twice. Sometime dey would beat on a sycamo tree in front uh duh house an call muh name, 'Tressie, Tressie, Tressie, wake up! Yuh gwine tuh sleep alluh time?'</p>

Duh uhmun jist keep on wukin gense me an nobody couldn do nuttn tuh stop uh so I know I bettuh moob fo she git muh spirit."</p> 
<p>In Brownville we found a man who knew how to make the old time drums. He made one for us out of a hollow log, across the end of which he tightly stretched a goat skin. He fastened the skin to the log by means of a number of wooden Pegs. Unlike modern drums, this one was taller than it was wide, measuring about eighteen inches in length and ten inches in diameter.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_25"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">25</FONT></A></p> 
<p>The drum maker, James Collier,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> a middle-aged, intelligent, well-educated Negro, said he had made a number of drums in this primitive manner. Collier told us that he had heard of drums having been used during funeral ceremonies in former years. The mourners beat the drum while on the way to the cemetery; after arriving they marched around the, grave in a ring and beat the drum and shouted.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_24"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">24</FONT></A> "They call it the dead march," explained the man.</p> 
<p>"The spirit don't stay in the grave," he went on. "When the funeral procession stahts tuh leave, the spirit leaves the body an follows the people frum the graveyahd. It nevuh stays with the body."&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_66"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">66</FONT></A> A little later he volunteered the additional information, "Fuh the spirit tuh rest in the grave folks</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p><a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="green">p. 58</font></A></p> 
<p>have tuh be buried at home. They nevuh feel right ef they buried frum home. The spirit jist wanduh aroun.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_1"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p> 
<p>"I have seen something I think wuz a ghost. I have no explanation of it, but I think it wuz supuhnatural. I have heard of witchcraft, cunjuh an magic. I believe some of these things happen, and the mo yuh probe intuh them the less yuh know.</p> 
<p>"I have heard about a magic hoe that folks put in the gahden. They speak certain words tuh it; then the hoe goes ahead an cultivates the gahden without anyone touching it. They jist tell it tuh do the wuk and it does it."&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_39"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">39</FONT></A></p> 
<p>We questioned Collier again about his personal experiences with supernatural beings and he related the following story:</p> 
<p>"Wen I wuz jist a young boy muh family use tuh live in Currytown. Me and muh brothuh use tuh go and see muh aunt who lived in Yamacraw. Tuh get frum our house tuh wheah she lived we had tuh go past a cemetery which wuz in back of the Union Station.</p> 
<p>"One time we had been tuh see muh aunt and it got tuh be late. We stahted fuh home. It wuz beginnin of night. Muh brothuh he had rheumatism an he wuz hobblin along on a stick. We stahted along by a fence tuh get tuh West Broad Street an wen we had gone about a hundred yards we saw a lady comin tuhwards us.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_59"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">59</FONT></A> She wuz very feah, very feah, an she wuz all dressed in black and had on a long black veil. Her dress wuz black silk and rustled as she walked.</p> 
<p>"Muh brothuh an I, we were suhprised tuh see the lady all of a sudden, fuh we hadn't noticed her befo. She come up tuh us an she say, 'Are yuh goin roun the fence?' We tell her we wuz an she say, 'Yuh not afraid?' an we say, 'No--we not afraid.'</p> 
<p>"The lady wanted tuh walk with us an we all staht walkin along. We had gone a short ways wen all of a sudden we look in the cemetery an we see a little white thing risin up out of the groun. It wuz kinduh hazy an shadowy an it spring up from the groun an streak out tuh meet us on the path ahead. it looked like a lill animal.&nbsp;<A HREF="das26.htm#xref_54"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">54</FONT></A></p> 
<p>"The lady, wen she see the lill white sumpms a comin, she daht out like lightin an she go right tuh meet it. Wen she get tuh it she disappeah right intuh the eah, disappeah right</p> 
<p><a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="green">p. 59</font></A></p> 
<p>befo our eyes. Muh brothuh fuhgot he wuz crippled, he drop his stick an staht runnin, an I run too. An we nevuh stop runnin, kept right on goin till we got home tuh Currytown. He don't like to speak of it tuhday cause we're not supuhstitious."</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_46"></A><A HREF="das11.htm#fr_46">43:1</A> Though the meetings of Bishop Grace are common to many parts of the United States, it was thought well to include an accurate description of the House of Prayer as it was found in this Community.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_47"></A><A HREF="das11.htm#fr_47">44:1</A> Details of the early life of "Daddy Grace" are clothed in obscurity and little can be learned of the real origin of the House of Prayer. Some claim that he is of West Indian birth, others that he was born Marcilino Manuel Garcia in Portugal, and still others interpret his references to "a land beyond the sea" as indication that he hails from Egypt. All members of the cult must be baptized and during a four-week session in 1936 1,789 candidates were ministered to at a charge of <small>1.00 each. The Bishop advocates that members give generously of their material goods to the church and he has been known on occasions to go about among his congregation seizing purses and demanding that worshipers sacrifice treasured jewelry. It is a well known fact that his profession of "spiritual leader" has proved a vastly profitable one, and in the course of the last several years he has amassed a huge fortune. Many of "Daddy's" enterprises are looked upon with disfavor and suspicion by the police department. His frequent clashes with the law over various matters of an extremely worldly nature serve only to increase the attendance and the collections at the church and also give the Bishop much desired publicity. Followers are unimpressed by his occasional arrests, secure in the knowledge that no earthly force can ever conquer "Daddy." See <i>Time</i> (New York), March 7,1938, XXXI, No. 10, p. 30.</P>
