<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE ADHESIVE SUBSTANCE USED BY THE BUSHMEN IN MARKING ARROWS.</H1>
<P>It is <I>|kwae</I><SMALL>[1]</SMALL>; it is <I>||kuarri</I> juice. It is like a pumpkin, it is round. Its juice is white; it is like water. Its juice is not a little white; its whiteness resembles milk. It is poison.</P>
<P>We make an incision(?) (and) set it (the <I>||kuwarri</I>) down; and then we hold a tortoise (shell) underneath it; because we wish its juice to be upon the tortoise (shell), that we may make <I>||kuae</I> of it. And we warm (it) by the fire, making it hot; and we beat(?) it, when it is hot. Then, we beat(?), cooling it. And we take it up in this manner,<SMALL>[2]</SMALL> with a "Driedoorn" stick; we do in this manner to it, with the "Driedoorn" stick, as we make it round; while we think that we intend to make little springbok arrows.</P>
<P><SMALL>[1. The later spelling of this word has been followed in the translation, as probably more correct.</P>
<P>2. The narrator here imitated the manner of taking lip the <I>|kwae</I> by means of rolling it upon a stick.]</SMALL></P>
