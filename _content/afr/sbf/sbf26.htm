<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE MAN WHO ORDERED HIS WIFE TO CUT OFF HIS EARS.</H1>
<P>He<SMALL>[1]</SMALL> formerly wished (his) wife to cut off his ears, for his younger brother's head had surely been skinned<SMALL>[2]</SMALL>; whereas his younger brother's wife had only shaved his younger brother's head.</P>
<P>Therefore, (his) wife cut away his ears; although (his) wife had said that she would not do so; he was the one who insisted (upon it).</P>
<P>Therefore, (his) wife cut off his ears; and he was screaming, on account of his skin, while he himself had been the one who wished the wife to do so; for his younger brother's head had surely been skinned; whereas his younger brother had merely had his head shaved; while (his) wife shaved, removing the old hair.<SMALL>[3]</SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>[1. <I>!Xwe-|na-sse-!k'e</I> is the name of the Bushmen who lived first in the land.</P>
<P>2. I am one who does not know his name, because the people were those who did not utter his name to me; for, they were men of the early race; therefore, they did foolish things on account of it.</P>
<P>3. He really thought that the skin of his younger brother's head was off, while it was his younger brother's head's hair which had been shaved away.]</SMALL></P>
