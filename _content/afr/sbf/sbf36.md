# THE SONG OF THE BUSTARD.

My younger brother-in-law,  
Put my head in the fire.<span class="small">\[1\]</span>  
My younger brother-in-law,  
My younger brother-in-law,  
Put my head in the fire.

When we startle it up, it flies away; it (cries): "

Wara \|\|khau, wara \|\|khau, wara \|\|khau, \|\|khau \|\|khau,
\|\|khau, wara \|\|khau, wara \|\|khau, wara \|\|khau, \|\|khau
\|\|khau, \|\|khau!"

When it stands on the ground, it says: "*A wa,a wa, a wa, a wa!"* when
it stands on the ground.

<span class="small">\[1. When the "Knorhaan Brandkop" was still a man,
his head was thrust into the fire by his brother-in-law, in order to
punish him for having surreptitiously married a sister. Since then he is
only a bustard.\]</span>
