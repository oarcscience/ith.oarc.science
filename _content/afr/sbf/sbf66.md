# THE BUSHMAN DRUM AND DANCING RATTLES.<span class="small">\[1\]</span>

They tie, putting the bag over the pot's (drum's) mouth.<span
class="small">\[2\]</span> Then they tie on the sinew. And they pull the
drum's surface tight; for they wish that the drum may sound, when they
beat the drum.

The men will tie springbok ears upon their feet;<span
class="small">\[3\]</span> they will dance, while the springbok ears
sound, as springbok ears are wont to do, like what we call dancing
rattles. Springbok ears (they) are; we call them dancing rattles. They
sound well, when we have tied (them) on to our feet. They sound well,
when we have tied (them) on to our feet. They sound well, they rattle as
we dance, when we have tied (them) on to our feet. The drum which the
women beat sounds well. Therefore, the men dance well on account of it,
while they feel that the drum, which the women beat, sounds well. The
dancing rattles which the men tie upon their feet sound well, because a
woman who works nicely is the one who has worked them. Therefore, they
sound nicely, because they are good. Therefore, they sound nicely,
because they are good.

when it is wet, they tie it over the pot's mouth and they try the drum.
