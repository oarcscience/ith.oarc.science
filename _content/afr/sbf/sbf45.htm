<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE BABOONS AND ||XABBITEN||XABBITEN.</H1>
<P>The baboons espied <I>||Xabbiten||Xabbiten</I>. as he was coming away from the white men whom he had been to visit. He was carrying flonr, which the white men gave him. And the baboons said: "Uncle <I>||Xabbiten||Xabbiten</I> seems to be returning yonder; let us cross his path (?), that we may knock him down."</P>
<P>The baboons did so; <I>||Xabbiten||Xabbiten</I> thought he would speak to them, he asked them what they were saying. And <I>||Xabbiten||Xabbiten</I> remarked upon their foreheads' steepness (?).<SMALL>[1]</SMALL> And the baboons angrily came down to <I>||Xabbiten||Xabbiten</I>; they</P>
<P><SMALL>[1. "Ye speak to me! ye are ugly! your foreheads resemble overhanging cliffs!" The baboons became angry with him, because he derided them; he said that their foreheads resembled overhanging cliffs. And they broke off sticks, on account of it they went towards <I>||Xabbiten||Xabbiten.</I>]</SMALL></P>
<P>broke off sticks, with which they intended to come to beat <I>||Xabbiten||Xabbiten</I>.</P>
<P>The baboons' children also came; going along, they called out to their parents.about it: "O fathers! ye must give us <I>||Xabbiten||Xabbiten</I>'s head that we may play with it."</P>
<I><P>||Xabbiten||Xabbiten</I> did as follows, when he heard that the baboons' children were speaking in this manner, he thought to himself, 'What shall I do? for the baboons are not a little numerous.' He thought, 'I will climb a krieboom, that I may sit above in the krieboom; the baboons will have (?) to drag me down from the krieboom.'</P>
<P>And the baboons went up to him, as he sat above in the krieboom; the baboons' children spoke to each other about it, they said: "First look ye at <I>||Xabbiten||Xabbiten</I>'s big head; we should be a Iong while playing there, with <I>||Xabbiten||Xabbiten</I>'s head; for ye are those who see that its bigness is like this; it seems as if it would not quickly break."A baboon, who was grown up,<SMALL>[1]</SMALL> spoke to the baboons' children; he questioned the baboons' children: Did not the baboons' children see that <I>||Xabbiten||Xabbiten</I> was grown up-that they who were children should think that they could possess the pieces of <I>||Xabbiten||Xabbiten</I>. They spoke as if he were their little cousin; that they should possess his pieces. Did they not see that those who are grown up would be the ones to get the pieces of <I>||Xabbiten||Xabbiten</I> those who are grown up?</P>
<P>And <I>||Xabbiten||Xabbiten</I> thought to himself: 'What shall I do, (in order) that the baboons may</P>
<P><SMALL>[1. The name of the head baboon, the big, old one, which goes after the rest, is <I>!uhai|ho|kwa</I>, or "Schildwacht"]</SMALL></P>
<P>leave me? for, they speak angrily about me. it sounds as if they would really attack me.' And 11 e <I>||Xabbiten||Xabbiten</I> thought to himself: 'Wait, I will first tell about the baboons to the white men. For baboons are not a little afraid of a gun; I shall see whether they will not be afraid, if they hear that I am talking about them to the white men.'</P>
<P>And <I>||Xabbiten||Xabbiten</I> called out,--while he deceived them,--he said: "O white men! the baboons are here, they are with me, ye must drive them away"(?). And the baboons did thus, when they heard that <I>||Xabbiten||Xabbiten</I> spoke about them, that the white men should drive them away (?), the baboons looked about, on account of it. And the baboons ran, leaving <I>||Xabbiten||Xabbiten</I>; and he escaped, at the time when the baboons went away in fear, he quickly descended from the krieboom. He ran away, as he escaped from the baboons; while they ran to the cliffs he ran away.</P>
