*Specimens of Bushman Folklore*, by W.H.I. Bleek and L.C. Lloyd,
\[1911\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# THE ADHESIVE SUBSTANCE USED BY THE BUSHMEN IN MARKING ARROWS.

It is *\|kwae*<span class="small">\[1\]</span>; it is *\|\|kuarri*
juice. It is like a pumpkin, it is round. Its juice is white; it is like
water. Its juice is not a little white; its whiteness resembles milk. It
is poison.

We make an incision(?) (and) set it (the *\|\|kuwarri*) down; and then
we hold a tortoise (shell) underneath it; because we wish its juice to
be upon the tortoise (shell), that we may make *\|\|kuae* of it. And we
warm (it) by the fire, making it hot; and we beat(?) it, when it is hot.
Then, we beat(?), cooling it. And we take it up in this manner,<span
class="small">\[2\]</span> with a "Driedoorn" stick; we do in this
manner to it, with the "Driedoorn" stick, as we make it round; while we
think that we intend to make little springbok arrows.

\[1. The later spelling of this word has been followed in the
translation, as probably more correct.

2\. The narrator here imitated the manner of taking lip the *\|kwae* by
means of rolling it upon a stick.\]
