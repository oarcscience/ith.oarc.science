# THE \#NERRU, AS A BIRD

The *\#nerru*'s bill is very short. The male *\#nerru* is the one whose
plumage resembles (that of) the ostrich; it is black like the male
ostrich. The female *\#nerru* is the one whose plumage is white like
(that of) the female ostrich. Thus, they resemble the ostriches; because
the male *\#nerru* are black, the female *\#nerru* white.

They eat the things which little birds usually eat, which they pick up
on the ground.

They make grass nests on the ground, by the root of a bush.

When not breeding, they are found in large numbers.
