# THE BUSHMAN SOUP SPOON.<span class="small">\[1\]</span><span class="small">\[2\]</span>

The hair of the Proteles is here, that part of the hair which is on the
top of its back.<span class="small">\[3\]</span> The roots of the hair
are here, those which stick into the skin.

I do not know whether it is springbok's paxwax<span
class="small">\[4\]</span> <span class="small">\[which binds the hair on
the stick\]</span>. This is the (wood of the) "Driedoorn" (the
"Driedoorn") is a bush.

We scratch the fire together with it (*i.e.*, with the handle of the
brush). Therefore, the fire burns, blackening this part of it. It
becomes black.

\[1. Among some Bushman implements given to Dr. Bleek. by a friend, was
the brush of which a picture appears in the illustrations. *\|\|kabbo*
recognized this at once as a Bushman "soup spoon" and showed us, with
immense pleasure, in what manner the bushmen eat soup with it, and how
well it can be used to take up the fat on the top of the soup, if rolled
round in it.

2\. The men are those who bind (i.e., make) them.

3\. Really along its back, the narrator explains.

4\. It is in the flesh; it lies upon the bone. It is yellow.\]
