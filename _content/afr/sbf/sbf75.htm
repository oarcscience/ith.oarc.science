<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">||HARA AND TTO.</H1>
<I><P>||hara</I><SMALL>[1]</SMALL> is black; the people <SMALL>[having mixed it with fat]</SMALL> anoint their heads with it; while <I>tto</I> is red, and the people rub their bodies with it, when they have pounded it; they pound it, pound it, pound it, they rub their bodies with it. They pound <I>||hara</I>, they anoint their heads, when they have first</P>
<P><SMALL>[1. A certain stone which is said to be both hard and soft.]</SMALL></P>
<P>pounded the <I>tto</I>; they first rub their bodies with <I>tto</I>. And they pound <I>||hara,</I> they anoint their heads. They anoint their heads very nicely, while they wish that their head's hair may descend (i.e., grow long). And it becomes abundant on account of it; because they have anointed their heads, wishing that the hair may grow downwards, that their heads may become black with blackness, while their heads are not a little black.</P>
<P>And they return, when they come away from the other man, while they return to their home; when they have told the other person (the woman) about it, that the other person shall prepare <SMALL>[More]</SMALL> <I>||hara</I> for them, as well as <I>tto</I>. For he (the man) also goes, (his) wife will go to dress bags for him, bags which he will also bring to the other man; while the other (man's wife) will also put aside <I>||hara</I> for him, when the other (man) collects <I>||hara</I>. And the other (man) comes to put aside <I>||hara</I> for him; while she <SMALL>[the wife of the man who brought the bags]</SMALL> also dresses (and) puts away bags for the other; for, she has told the other (woman) that the other must also bring her <I>||hara</I> and <I>tto</I>; for she has been to the other, and she will not be coming (soon again) to the other, for, the other must go to her; the other must go to receive the bags, when the other takes <I>tto</I> to her. Therefore, the other one also does so; she takes to the other <I>tto</I> and <I>||hara</I>.</P>
<I><P>||hara</I> sparkles; therefore, our heads shimmer, on account of it; while they feel that they sparkle, they shimmer. Therefore, the Bushmen are wont to say, when the old women are talking there: "That man, he is a handsome young man, on account of his head, which is surpassingly beautiful with the <I>||</I>hara's blackness." They say, "Handsome young man" to him, "His head is surpassingly beautiful; for, his head is like the <I>!khi</I> tree.<SMALL>[1]</SMALL></P>
<P>It is a tree which is in our country; it is the <I>!khi</I> tree; it is large; (it) is a great tree. They are not a little abundant in our country: the <I>||Ukerri</I> tree and the <I>khi</I>.</P>
<P><SMALL>[1. The <I>!khi</I> tree bears berries; and has no thorns.]</SMALL></P>
