<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE GREAT STAR, !GAUNU, WHICH, SINGING, NAMED THE STARS.</H1>
<I><P>!gaunu</I>,<SMALL>[1]</SMALL> he was formerly a great Star; therefore, his name is <I>!gaunu</I>; while he feels that he was the one who formerly spoke (lit. "called") the Stars' names; while he feels that he is a great one. Therefore, he called the Stars' names. Therefore, the Stars possess their names; while they feel that <I>!gaunu</I> was the one who called their names. He formerly sang, while he uttered the Stars' names. He said "<I>||Xwahai</I>"<SMALL>[2]</SMALL> to (some) Stars which are very small; they are those of which he made <I>||Xwhai</I>; their small, fine ones are those which are <I>||Xwhai.</P>
</I><P><SMALL>[1. My (paternal) grandfather, <I>|Xugen-ddi</I>, was the one who told me star's stories."</P>
<P>2. The stars <I>||Xwahai |aiti</I> and <I>||Xwhai-@pua</I> were identified as "Altair" or "Alpha Aquilae", and "Gamma Aquilae", respectively, by the late Mr. George Maclear and Mr. Finlay of the Royal Observatory, on October 10, 1873, at Mowbray. <I>||Xwhai gwai</I> was behind a tree and too low to be distinguished.]</SMALL></P>
<P>Therefore, the porcupine, when these Stars have, sitting, turned back, he will not remain on the hunting ground; for, he knows that it is dawn, when <I>||Xwhai</I> has, lying, turned back. He returns home; for, he is used to look at these Stars; they are those which he watches; while he feels that he knows that the dawn's Stars they are.</P>
