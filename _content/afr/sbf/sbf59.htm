<P>A little boy has this hand out.<SMALL>[1]</SMALL> A female child has this hand cut,<SMALL>[2]</SMALL> because she is a little girl, therefore, she has the hand of her female arm cut; because this is her female hand. The little boy feels that he is a little boy, therefore, he has this hand cut, his male arm, for, they shoot with this hand. Another boy does not have his hand cut; another girl does not have her hand cut.</P>
<P>Thus, the boy has this arm cut, with which they intend him to shoot; therefore, he turns this (the right) hand, when be grasps the arrow, he turns this (the left) hand, when he grasps the bow.</P>
<P>Another man has this (the right) ear pierced; he also has that (the left) ear pierced. Another woman has this (the left) ear pierced, because she feels that her female arm is here (i.e., on this side); she also has this (the right) ear pierced, because she feels that her male arm is here; she also has her nose pierced.</P>
<P>Another woman does not have her nose pierced, because the other woman is ugly; the other woman who has had her nose pierced, is handsome.</P>
