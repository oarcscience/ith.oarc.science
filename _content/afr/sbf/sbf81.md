# APPENDIX.

## A. FEW !KUNG TEXTS.

### THE DOINGS OF \|XUE ARE MANY.

The works of *\|Xue* are many, and were not one, but many; and my
father's father, *Karu*, told me about *\|Xue*'s doings, for *\|Xue*'s
works are numerous.

### VARIOUS TRANSFORMATIONS OF \|XUE

## 1. \|XUE AS !NAXANE.

(When) the sun rose, *\|Xue* was *!naXane*; the birds ate *\|Xue*;
*\|Xue* was *!naXane*. The sun set, (and) *\|Xue*, was *\|Xue*; and lay
down and slept. The night fell, and *\|Xue* lay down, (he) slept; the
place was dark; and the sun rose, and *\|Xue* was another (kind of)
*!naXane*, a large (kind of) *!naXane*, which is a tree. And the night
fell, (and) *\|Xue* was not a tree, and was *\|Xue*, and lay down.
