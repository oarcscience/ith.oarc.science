<P>The sun set, and <I>|Xue</I> was <I>|Xue</I>, and lay upon the ground, and slept, was alone, and lay upon the ground and slept. And the sun rose, and <I>|Xue</I> awoke and . . . and stood up, and saw the sun,--a little sun,--and was <I>||gui</I>, and was a tree.</P>
<P>And his wife saw the <I>||gui</I>, and went to the <I>||gui</I>, and went to take hold of a <I>|gui</I> fruit, and the <I>||gui</I> vanished; and <I>|Xue</I> was a fly. And his wife laid herself upon the earth, and cried about the <I>|gui</I>, and died. And <I>|Xue</I> was a fly, and settled upon the grass.<SMALL>[1]</SMALL> And his wife lay down upon the earth, and cried about the <I>||gui</I><SMALL>[2]</SMALL></P>
<P><SMALL>[1. And he settled upon the grass, and the grass broke. The name of the grass is <I>goo</I>.</P>
<P>2. The <I>||gui</I> is a tree. People eat the <I>||gui</I>, the<I>||gui</I> fruit. People do not put the <I>||gui</I> into a pot, but eat it raw. The <I>||gui</I> has thorns.]</SMALL></P>
