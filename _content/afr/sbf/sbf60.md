## SECOND ACCOUNT.

Her father, *\|Ukwaiyau*, was the one who cut off the upper joint of his
daughter *Kaueten-ang*'s little finger.<span class="small">\[1\]</span>

My husband was the one who cut off (the upper joint of) *!kabbe-tu*'s
("Willem Streep's") finger.

<span class="small">\[1. *\|Xaken-ang* further explained that the joint
is cut off with reed. It is thought to make children live to grow up. It
is done before they suck at all.\]</span>
