# TO BEAT THE GROUND (WITH A STONE).

The *!kung* beat a stone upon the ground. My father's mother beat a
stone upon the ground. She said: "Fall into the water ! Fall into the
water!" And the thing (the lightning?) fell into the water.

A man does not beat a stone upon the ground. A woman beats a stone upon
the ground.

My (*Tamme*'s) father's mother was *Ng-\|\|na*. My mother's father was
Little *Tamme*; and my mother's mother was *!karo-\|\|n'a*. My father's
father's father was Great *Tamme*.
