<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE MARKING OF ARROWS.</H1>
<P>The Bushmen are those who mark arrows,<SMALL>[1]</SMALL> while they wish that they may recognize the arrows, when they are shooting springbok at one place. And, when they are following the springbok spoor, when</P>
<P><SMALL>[1. All the arrows.]</SMALL></P>
<P>they are going along picking up the arrows they recognize the arrows. They say: "Thy arrow it seems to be, for, their mark is like this." Another man says: "Yes, my arrow is yonder." They again go to pick up this arrow. The other man says: "My arrow seems to be yonder; for their mark is like this."</P>
<I><P>|kwae</I><SMALL>[1]</SMALL> is that with which they make the marks. They put <I>tto</I> into (it), and they pound the <I>tto</I> together with the <I>||kuae</I>; and the <I>||kuae</I> becomes red on account of it; then, they mark the arrows with it.</P>
<P><SMALL>[1. They (the farmers) call it "Harpis." (Probably harpuis, * * * "resin.")]</SMALL></P>
