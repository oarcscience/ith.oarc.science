# VI. Poetry.

## THE CAT'S SONG.

Ha<span class="small">\[1\]</span> ha ha,  
Ha, Ha,

I am the one whom the Lynx derides,  
I am the one who did not run fast;  
For, the Lynx is the one who runs fast,

Ha<span class="small">\[1\]</span> ha ha,  
Ha, Ha,

I am the one whom the Lynx derides.

Ya Ya Ya,  
Ya Ya,

I am the one whom the Lynx derides.  
I am the one who could not run fast,

Ya Ya Ya,  
Ya Ya,

I am the one whom the Lynx derides,  
"The Cat could not run fast."

Ya Ya Ya,  
Ya Ya,

The Cat is the one whom the Lynx derides,  
"It is the one who could not run fast,"

Ya Ya Ya,  
Ya Ya,

The Cat is the one who could not run fast,  
It was not cunning.

<span class="small">\[1. Here the cat opens its mouth wide in
singing.\]</span>

It did foolish things;  
For, the Lynx is one who understands,  
The Cat does not understand."  
The Cat (nevertheless) is cunning.

Ya Ya Ya,  
Ya Ya,

The Cat is the one about whom the Lynx talked.  
"It is the one who could not run fast."  
It had to be cunning.<span class="small">\[1\]</span>  
For, the Lynx is one who is cunning.

Haggla<span class="small">\[2\]</span> haggla haggla  
haggla haggla  
Heggle heggle heggle  
heggle heggle  
Heggli heggli heggli  
Heggli ng!

\[1. Reference is here made to the Cat's way of doubling when pursued.

2\. The narrator here explains that the Cat "talks with its tongue",
assenting to what it has been saying.\]
