### THE LEOPARD AND THE JACKAL.

The jackal watches the leopard, when the leopard has killed a springbok.
The jackal whines (with uplifted tongue), he begs the leopard for
springbok flesh. He howls, he begs, for he is a jackal. Thus he howls,
he indeed begs, because he is a jackal. Therefore he howls when he begs,
he indeed wants the leopard to give him flesh, that he may eat, that he
also may eat.

Then the leopard is angry, the leopard kills him, the leopard bites him
dead, he lifts him up, he goes to put him into the bushes; thus he hides
him.
