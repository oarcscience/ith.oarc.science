# THE SONG OF THE CAAMA FOX.

Crosser of the Spoor, Crosser of the Spoor,<span
class="small">\[1\]</span>  
Crosser of the Spoor, Crosser of the Spoor!

<span class="small">\[1. The Caama Fox is called "Crosser of the Spoor",
because it avoids the dog nicely when the dog chases it, and, turning
suddenly, runs back, crossing the dog's spoor (behind it), while the dog
is racing on in front, thinking to catch the Caama Fox by so
doing.\]</span>

Cross the Caama Fox's spoor,  
Cross the Caama Fox's spoor!<span class="small">\[1\]</span>

Cross the Caama Fox's spoor,  
Cross the Caama Fox's spoor!

<span class="small">\[1. It sings that the dog appears to think that he
will kill it; but the dog will not kill it; for it is the one who
crosses the spoor of (another) Caamaa Fox. It is the one which that dog
will not kill; for the dog is the one who will nearly(?) die of fatigue,
when it (the Caama Fox) has gone to lie peacefully in the shade; while
it does not feel tired; while the dog painfully goes back to his
master.\]</span>
