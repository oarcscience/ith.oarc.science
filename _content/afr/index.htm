<P>
Ultimately, we are all Africans.
Studies of mitochondrial DNA have proven that all human beings
are descended from a small population (less than a hundred individuals)
that emerged from Africa about 60,000 years ago.
The earliest written religious texts as well as
the first documented monotheistic religion also developed in Africa.
During the European dark ages, many ancient manuscripts were preserved
in African libraries in places such as Ethiopia and Timbuctoo.
</P>
<P>
This section has texts on the traditional spirituality of
Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as their descendants in the New World.</P>
<P>
Finding books about African religion and spiritual beliefs
<A HREF="../faq.htm#public_domain"> in the public domain</A> was not difficult.
These books have a great amount of useful information on this topic,
some of it written before colonialism destroyed or greatly modified
aspects of traditional culture.
The problem with these works is that they were for the large part
written by Europeans with their particular biases and agendas.
For this reason, we encourage you to 'read between the lines'.</P>
<P>
The texts here are provided for scholarly purposes.
They may contain racist characterizations, errors of interpretation,
or misrepresentations of traditional culture.
For instance, the term 'Kaffir', which is used in many of
these texts to refer to the Xhosa (Nelson Mandela's tribe),
is now considered derogatory.
</P>
<P>
This page also has texts and books with alternate views, primarily written
by African-Americans, which, in our opinion, also deserve consideration.
</P>

<P>
Africa is home to a rich religious tradition.

<A HREF="../egy/index.htm">Ancient Egypt</A>,
<A HREF="../isl/index.htm">Islam</A>, and

<P>
The West African area is important because this is where the majority of
slaves departed for the New World.  Hence large elements of
West African, particularly Yoruba, religion (blended with Catholicism)
can be found in religions such as Vodun (also known as Voodoo) (Haiti),
Candombl&egrave; (Brazil) and Santeria (Carribean).
For more information on New World African-derived religions, refer to the
