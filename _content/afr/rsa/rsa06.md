## AMATONGO; OR, ANCESTOR WORSHIP.

> already spoke of there being Amatongo, say, "We came into being
> possessed of them."
>
>  All the first men, then, spoke of the Amatongo; and they told those
> who came into being after them, as soon as they came into being, that
> there are Amatongo. And further in the beginning, as soon as they came
> into being, they had doctors<span
> id="page_130_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_130_note_3) who taught them that
> there are Amatongo. And so they said that the Amatongo were
> created<span id="page_130_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_130_note_4) by the
> first man, who said, "There are Amatongo who are snakes." The first
> man is Umvelinqangi, Unkulunkulu. And thus all nations knew of the
> Amatongo. There was not a single nation which said, "We people of such
> a country have no Itongo."
>
>  All nations worshipped the Amatongo, because Umvelinqangi <span
> id="page_131">p. 131</span> commanded them to do so, saying, "You see,
> then,<span id="page_131_fr_5"></span>[5](#page_131_note_5) I tell you
> about the Amatongo, that you may worship them. I tell you about
> divining Izinyanga,<span
> id="page_131_fr_6"></span>[6](#page_131_note_6) that you may enquire
> of them, and they tell you when a man has been made ill by the
> Amatongo; they shall hear the Itongo declaring that he has been made
> ill by the Amatongo."
>
>  So all nations used to think when they were about to attack an army,
> that they should be assisted by the Itongo; and although they were
> killed by the army, the friends of those who were killed said, "The
> Itongo of our people has turned its back on us." They asked, "How is
> it that all our people have at length come to an end, and not one man
> come back from the army?"
>
>  If there is one who has escaped, he says, "As for me I escaped I know
> not how. The Amatongo had decreed that we should all die; one man<span
> id="page_131_fr_7"></span>[7](#page_131_note_7) would not assent; when
> we were destroyed by the enemy, where was he I wonder? I escaped I
> know not how; I no longer expected to be saved, when I saw all our
> people destroyed."
>
> <span id="page_132">p. 132</span>
>
>  At first the people say, "The Amatongo of our people are good for
> nothing! Why has the whole village perished in the fight? So many men
> as there were! Our whole army destroyed by the enemy! How did it
> happen that they turned the back on so many? How is it that they never
> mentioned any thing to us that we might understand why they were
> angry? Have they at last destroyed the whole village? has it come
> utterly to an end? Where had the Itongo who saved So-and-so gone? Why
> was he not among the other Amatongo?" Those who weep for the dead say
> thus.
>
>  And those who died in the fight will now become Amatongo.
>
>  And those who escaped, whose national Amatongo looked on them and
> saved them, say, "We have been saved by the Amadhlozi of our people."
> When they come back from the army, they sacrifice cattle to the
> Amatongo; they return thanks because they think they have saved them;
> they pour the gall of the sacrifices on their bodies, saying, "Let the
> Amatongo be bright and white, and not dark, that they may save us on
> another occasion. " They return thanks with glad hearts.
>
>  And there is funeral lamentation <span id="page_133">p. 133</span>
> where they have lost their people; they say, their Idhlozi is dark. At
> length they sacrifice, that if perchance their chief lead them again
> to attack the enemy, the Amatongo of their people may have no cause of
> complaint, because they have made amends to them, and made them
> bright; and now when they reach the enemy they know what they have
> done, and say, "Can it be, since we have made amends to the Amadhlozi,
> that they will say we have wronged them by anything?" When they see
> the enemy with which they are about to fight, they remember the
> Amadhlozi, and think of what they have done for them, by sacrificing
> to them that they may be propitious; they see that in their hearts,
> and know that they have made amends to the Amadhlozi of their people,
> and that though they die they cannot say there is any thing of which
> the Amadhlozi have reason to complain.
>
>  So truly they are very brave, saying, "The Amatongo will turn their
> backs on us without cause." For when they go to the enemy they say,
> "The Amadhlozi of our people go with us;" and so they fight with the
> enemy. And if their Amadhlozi are white and do not allow them to die,
> and they kill on their side only, then they see that their Amadhlozi
> go with <span id="page_134">p. 134</span> them. But on the part of
> those who are conquered, those who survive say, "We have no Amadhlozi.
> Why have we died utterly? Why have our Amadhlozi been conquered by the
> Amadhlozi of other people?" For those who have not died say, "The
> Amadhlozi of So-and-so have been conquered by the Amadhlozi of our
> tribe."
>
>  Thus it is with black men; they did not come into being when it was
> said, "There are no Amatongo." They came into being when it was
> already said, "There are Amatongo." But we do not know why the man
> which first came into being said, "There are Amatongo." Was there ever
> a man who whilst living said he was a snake? For we too do not
> understand why Umvelinqangi said, "The Idhlozi is a snake." For a man
> dies having no tail; and even we in that respect do not believe in a
> snake; for if a man is asleep, and dreams of a snake, he awakes
> immediately and starts; but if he dream of a dead man, he speaks with
> him of affairs in a dream; but if he dream of a snake, he does not
> talk with it; he starts. For my part, I say there are no Amadhlozi
> with tails. And we say Umvelinqangi made a mistake when he said,
> "People are snakes." For old men, when we ask why it <span
> id="page_135">p. 135</span> is said that the Amadhlozi are snakes,
> say, "Because they are Amadhlozi." And we ask saying, "Just tell us if
> dead men have tails." They are puzzled there, and cannot tell us. And
> so we say, "O, how is it that you do not tell us whether the Amadhlozi
> are snakes?" So they repeat the same words; they are puzzled and do
> not tell us, that we may understand. We understand if they say, "The
> Amadhlozi are in snakes;" we do not understand if they say, "The snake
> is an Idhlozi."

>  We then, who come into being at the present time, now say, <span

> T<span class="small">HE</span> people say their Amadhlozi exist. They

> id="page_141">p. 141</span> who are dead, saying, "There is your food;

T<span class="small">HE</span> subject of the following narrative was a
convert of some eleven or twelve years' standing. He has always
manifested great uncertainty of character and a very impressible nervous
system, and for many years has had from time to time subjective
apparitions, and been in the habit of dreaming strange, life-like
dreams. One day he suddenly left the mission station. The following
account was obtained front a native who was sent to enquire of him at
the village where he was living. I have had an opportunity of seeing him
since the underneath was given me. He has many symptoms of hysteria,
appears fully to believe in his feelings; and yet at the same time to be
practising deceit on others, and probably too on himself.

> T<span class="small">HE</span> account of the illness of James, which
> is not intelligible among Christians; for although a person may appear
> to be affected with those symptoms which precede the power of
> divination, yet when he goes to a mission station all that ceases
> through continually hearing the word of God. There are many who were
> so affected, but are now so no longer. But as regards him who is now
> so old, it is marvellous <span id="page_186">p. 186</span> that he
> should begin to be so affected, as though he had only just come to a
> Christian village.
>
>  I and Paul reached the place where he is, going with the intention of
> taking him by surprise, saying to each other, "Do not let him hear or
> see us; let him first see us when we are already in the hut, before he
> puts himself to rights, that we may see what he does now when no man
> is looking at him."
>
>  When we came he was lying down covered with two blankets—one black,
> the other grey and old. When he saw us he remained lying and was
> silent. I aroused him, saying, "Arouse." He writhed himself and said
> "Just have patience. I am about to arise. Make haste and tell me! Make
> haste and tell me! What has happened at home?" But was a long time
> before he arose.
>
>  At length he arose and saluted us; and we saluted him. I asked him,
> saying, "James, how are you?" He said, "I am very ill." I said, "What
> is the matter with you?" He said, "I have a disease with which I am
> not acquainted." I said, "Tell me all about it." He began by saying:
>
>  "O, truly, you are right. If it were a mere boy who asked, I would
> not say a single word. But <span id="page_187">p. 187</span> since it
> is you who ask, I will tell you everything. At first I was afraid, and

> from you, I can make no concealment.
>
>  "Long ago this disease began, even before I quitted the house on the

> psased off again. It first began by creeping up from my fingers and

> *How to distinguish Snakes which are Amatongo from common Snakes.*
>
> T<span class="small">HE</span> snakes into which men turn are not
> many; they are distinct and well known. They are the black Imamba, and
> the green Imamba, which is called Inyandezulu. Chiefs turn into these.
> <span id="page_197">p. 197</span> Common people turn into the
> Umthlwazi, and chieftainesses. Another snake is called Ubulube or
> Inkwakwa, and another Umzingandhlu; common people turn into these
> only.
>
>  These snakes are known to be human beings when they enter a hut; they
> do not usually enter by the doorway. Perhaps they enter when no one is
> there, and go to the upper part of the hut, and stay there coiled up.
> A snake of this kind does not eat frogs or mice; it remains quiet,
> until some one sees it and calls others; it is not afraid so as to run
> away, and it is left alone. Some say, "Let it be killed." Others say,
> "What, kill a man?"
>
>  If the snake has a scar on the side, someone, who knew a certain dead
> man of that place who also had such a scar, comes forward and says,
> "It is So-and-so. Do you not see the scar on his side?" It is left
> alone, and they go to sleep.
>
>  During the night the chief of the village dreams, and the dead man
> says to him, "Do you now wish to kill me? Do you already forget me? I
> thought I would come and ask for food; and do you kill me? I am
> So-and-so."
>
>  In the morning he tells his dreams, and says, "Let a sin-offering be
> sacrificed, lest the Itongo be angry and kill us." They fetch a
> bullock or goat; and pray <span id="page_198">p. 198</span> and eat
> the flesh. They look, and the snake is no longer there. It has now
> entirely disappeared.
>
>  A mere snake, when it comes into a hut, looks from side to side, and
> is afraid of men; and it is killed because it is known to be a wild
> snake.
>
>  A snake is also known by its mere appearance to be an animal, even
> though it does not look from side to side, because it is neither an
> Imamba<span id="page_198_fr_53"></span>[53](#page_198_note_53) that is
> a man, nor the Inyandezulu,<span
> id="page_198_fr_54"></span>[54](#page_198_note_54) which is known to
> be a man. Those which are men and those which are not, are

> men.
>
>  Those which are men are known by their frequenting huts, and by their

>
>  He who had a scar is recognised by that; and he who had but one eye

>
>  Again, if a snake which is an <span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

>
>  After that they went to the diviners, that they might hear what was

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I<span class="small">T</span> may be worth while to note the curious
coincidence of thought among the Amazulu regarding the Amatongo or
Abapansi, and that of the Scotch and Irish regarding the fairies or
"good people."

 For instance, the "good people" of the Irish have ascribed to them in
many respects the same motives and actions as the Amatongo. They call
the living to join them, that is, by death; they cause disease which
common doctors cannot understand, nor cure; they have their feelings,
interests, partialities, and antipathies, and contend with each other
about the living. The common people call them their friends or people,
which is equivalent to the term *abakubo* given to the Amatongo. They
reveal themselves in the form of the dead, and it appears to be supposed
that the dead become "good poople," as the dead among the Amazulu become
Amatongo: and in the funeral processions of the "good people," which
some have professed to see, are recognised the forms of those who have
just died; as Umkatshana <span id="page_227">p. 227</span> saw his
relatives among the Abapansi.<span
id="page_227_fr_77"></span>[77](#page_227_note_77) And the power of
holding communion with the "good people" is consequent on an illness,
just as the power to divine among the natives of this country.<span
id="page_227_fr_78"></span>[78](#page_227_note_78)

 So also in the Highland Tales, a boy who had been carried away by the
fairies, on his return to his home speaks of them as "our folks," which
is equivalent to *abakwetu*, applied to the Amatongo.<span
id="page_227_fr_79"></span>[79](#page_227_note_79) And among the
Highlanders they are called "the good people," "the folk." They are also
said to "live underground," and are therefore Abapansi, or
Subterraneans.<span id="page_227_fr_80"></span>[80](#page_227_note_80)

 They are also, like the Abapansi, called ancestors. Thus "the Red Book
of Clanrannald is said not to have been dug up, but to have been found
*on* the moss. It seemed as if the ancestors sent it."<span
id="page_227_fr_81"></span>[81](#page_227_note_81)

 <span id="page_130_note_4"></span>[4](#page_130_fr_4) The native who
relates this does not, he says, mean that when Unkulunkulu was speaking
to primitive men, Amatongo were already in existence; but speaking of
the future as already present, he appointed the spirits of the dead to
be the protectors and helpers of the living:—that he said, "There are
Amatongo," but the people looked around, but were unable to see them
until death had deprived them of their parents, and then they addressed
prayers to them, received visits from them in dreams, or in the form of
snakes; and sacrificed to them.

is, perhaps, better to retain the native word than to translate it by a
word which does not fairly represent it. Inyanga, generally rendered
*doctor*, means a man skilled in any particular matter = *magus*. Thus,
an inyanga yokubula is a doctor or wise man of smiting, that is, with
divining rods—a diviner. Inyanga yemiti, a doctor of medicines. Inyanga
yensimbi, a smith, &c.

 <span id="page_142_note_10"></span>[10](#page_142_fr_10) *Ubulawo*, A
class of medicines, used for cleansing and brightening. Medicines used
with the view of removing from the system something that causes dislike,
and introducing into it something that will cause love.

 There are two kinds used in each case—black ubulawo and white ubulawo;
the black "washes," the white "wipes;" the black takes away the
"blackness"—"the evil,"—which causes a man to be disliked; the white
makes him "white"—causes him to be "bright"—gives him a "beauty,"—which
causes him to become an object of love and admiration.

 Both black and white ubulawo are roots of plants.

 The black is first used. The roots are bruised, mixed with water, and
"churned:" when a great deal of froth has been produced by the churning
process, it is drunk and the body is washed with it. It is used for
about a month. The first time of using it, the medicines are taken to
some place where the aloe is abundant; there a large fire is kindled of
aloe; and the medicine being prepared is drunk in large quantities; it
is emetic, and the contents of the stomach are ejected <span
id="footnotes_page_143">p. 143</span> into the fire so as to quench it;
the object being that the "badness," which is cast off, may be burnt up
and utterly consumed. On subsequent occasions the contents of the
stomach are ejected on pathways, that others may walk over it, and take
away the "insila" or filth that is the cause of offence which has been
cast out.

 When the treatment by the black ubulawo has been continued for the
proper period, the white is used much in the same way. The roots are
bruised, mixed with water, and churned. If the man is using it because
he has been rejected by some damsel, he adds to the medicine something
belonging to her which has been worn next her skin, especially beads;
whilst churning the medicines he praises the Amatongo, and prays for
success. When the froth is produced and rises high above the mouth of
the pot, he allows it to subside; and then takes some of the froth and
puts it on his head and sprinkles it over his body; and then drinks the
contents of the pot. It has an emetic effect. But the contents of the
stomach are ejected in the cattle-pen. This place is selected because
the white ubulawo is a "blessing."

 The special circumstances under which such medicines are used are when
a youth has been rejected; or when a man wishes to obtain a favour from
a chief or great man; or when he has been summoned by the chief to
answer a charge brought against him; or under the circumstances narrated
in the text. But in the case of "bringing home" the Itongo, the white
ubulawo only is used.

<span id="footnotes_page_145">p. 145</span>

 <span id="page_145_note_11"></span>[11](#page_145_fr_11) That is, they
suggest to the Itongo, by whose ill-will or want of care they are
afflicted, that if they should all die in consequence, and thus his
worshippers come to an end, he would have none to worship him; and
therefore for his own sake, as well as for theirs, he had better
preserve his people, that there may be a village for him to enter, and
meat of the sacrifices for him to eat.

*Itongo*,—a collective term meaning the inhabitants of the spirit-world,

 <span id="page_147_note_13"></span>[13](#page_147_fr_13) The narrator
from this point appears to relate something he has actually known, and
not any hypothetical case.

 <span id="page_147_note_14"></span>[14](#page_147_fr_14) *Umhlaba*, the
earth, is a name given to the Amatongo, that is, <span
id="footnotes_page_148">p. 148</span> the Abapansi, or Subterraneans. We
find such expressious as these:—"U guliswa umhlaba," The Itongo has made
him ill. "U bizwa umhlaba," He is summoned by the Itongo,—that is, he
will die. "U petwe umhlaba," He has been seized by the Itongo. "U
tshaywe umhlaba," He has been smitten by the Itongo, "U nomhlaba,"—"U
netongo," An Itongo has entered into him and is causing disease.

 *Umhlaba* is said to be an *ukuhlonipa* word. The following words are
also applied to the Ancestral Spirit:—Itongo, Idhlozi, Isituta. We also
have Izinkomo zomzimu. Among the Amazulu, Umzimu is a word used only in
this connection, and appears to be a collective term for the Amatongo.
But on the Zambesi, Azimo or Bazimo is used for the good spirits of the
departed. (*The Zambesi and its Tributaries. Livingstone, p.* 520.)
Compare also [Note above, p. 93](rsa01.htm#page_93_note_67). There is
also another word, Unyanya, which is used in the same way as Itongo.
Thus a man who has been fortunate says, "Ngi bhekwe Unyanya," I have
been regarded by Unyanya. Among the Amalala, we meet with another word,
Undhlalane, pl. Ondhlalane. Thus they say, "Undhlalane u ngi bhekile,"
Undhlalane has regarded me, that is, the Itongo. "Ondhlalane ba ngi
bhekile," The Ondlalalane have regarded me.—These words are probably the
names of some great ancestors, who, though now forgotten, were formerly
especially remembered and worshipped for their great and good deeds
whilst living.

and leave no cattle behind?"—Since he did not sacrifice all his cattle
to the Amatongo, but left some when he died, why should he be so

fighting.

opinion.—These two names are izibongo given to him on account of his

*U-nothlola-mazibuko*. The name of his club. It means,
He-who-watches-the-fords, that is, to prevent an enemy crossing to do
damage.—There is a terrible threat in his words.—It is common for braves
among the natives to give names to their clubs, spears, &c. Thus, one
calls his assagai which he uses for the purpose of getting food for his
household *U-simbela-banta-bami*, He-digs-up-for-my-children. Another
calls his *Imbubuzi*, The-groan-causer, because when it stabs men or
cattle their groans are heard, *Igumgehle*, the glutton, is the name of
a club, because when used in fighting, the opponents are destroyed with
as much rapidity as a glutton swallows his food. *U-silo-si-lambile*,
the name of an assagai, meaning the-hungry-leopard, is so called because
its owner attacks the enemy like a hungry leopard. *U-dhl’-ebusuku*,
The-eater-in-the-dark; the name of a club, so called because it is used
to destroy secretly and by stealth; the owner of it coming on his
victims by night, or rushing on them from an ambush.

 This custom of naming their choice weapons is met with among other
people in olden times. Thus Arthur commenced his career of greatness by
obtaining the miraculous sword Escalibore, which could

"Kerve steel, and yren, and al thing."

(*Ellis's Specimens. Vol. I., p.* 243.) He gave names also to his
shield, sword, and spear. Thus;—"Over his shoulders he threw his shield
called Priwen, on which a picture of holy Mary, mother of God,
constantly recalled her to his memory. Girt with Caliburn, a <span
id="footnotes_page_167">p. 167</span> most excellent sword, and
fablicated in the isle of Avalon, he graced his right hand with the
lance named Ron. This was a long and broad spear, well contrived for
slaughter." (*Id., p.* 60.)—Roland had his terrible sword Durindale.
(*Id. Vol. II., p.* 304. ) Otuel, the Saracen champion, had his sword
Corrouge. (*Id., p.* 317.) Charlemagne had his good sword Joyeuse.

recorded at the time. He dreamt that he was crossing a river with
Umpengula in a boat. When they were in the middle of the river, without
any apparent cause, the bottom of the boat opened and let him through,
and, after struggling for a time in the water, he found himself on a
sandbank in the midst of the stream, and saw Umpengula on the other
side, he having reached without difficulty the place of their
destination. All this time he seemed to himself as one dead, though not
deprived of sensation—that is, he thought he had died. He found himself
surrounded by huge dogs, which appeared ready to devour him, and many
black people, among whom he observed his own mother, who expressed her
wonder at finding him among them.—This is just one of those prophetic
dreams <span id="footnotes_page_189">p. 189</span> which is suggested to
a man by his own thoughts and wishes, and which help on its own
fulfilment by placing before his mind during sleep a distinct tableau of
the future such as whilst awake he would be afraid to form for himself.

likes meat; he eats only a small quantity; but it is the custom with
such people to ask to have sacrifices continually made to the Amatongo.
It is therefore common when these symptoms first manifest themselves to
seek means for laying the Itongo, lest the frequent sacrifices demanded
should impoverish them.

 <span id="page_196_note_52"></span>[52](#page_196_fr_52) This, as it is
told in the text, is not clear. It appears that the doctor pursued two
systems of treatment, with opposite objects. And this was really the
case. He first tried the "darkening" system, by using together with the
black sheep other medicines possessed of a darkening power; but not
succeeding, he tried the opposite system—the "brightening" plan, that
is, he acted subtlely, making the Itongo bright and clear, and willing
to come near the patient, and then by suddenly again resorting to the
"darkening" system, he made the Itongo dark for ever, and so "the spirit
was laid," and has never appeared since.
