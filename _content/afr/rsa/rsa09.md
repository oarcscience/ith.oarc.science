## IZINYANGA ZOKUBULA; OR, DIVINERS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> *The Initiation of a Diviner.*
>
> T<span class="small">HE</span> condition of a man who is about to be
> an inyanga<span id="page_259_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_259_note_1) is
> this: At first he is apparently robust; but in process of time he
> begins to be delicate, not having any real disease, but being very
> delicate. He begins to be particular about food, and abstains from
> some kinds, and requests his friends not to give him that food,
> because it makes him ill. He habitually avoids certain kinds of food,
> choosing what he likes, and he does not eat much of that; and he is
> continually complaining of pains in different parts of his body. And
> he tells them that he has dreamt that he was being carried away by a
> river. He dreams of many things, and his body is muddled<span
> id="page_259_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_259_note_2) <span id="page_260">p.
> 260</span> and he becomes a house of dreams.<span
> id="page_260_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_260_note_3) And he dreams
> constantly of many things, and on awaking says to his friends, "My
> body is muddled to-day; I dreamt many men were killing me; I escaped I
> know not how. And on waking one part of my body felt different from
> other parts; it was no longer alike all over." At last the man is very
> ill, and they go to the diviners to enquire.
>
>  The diviners do not at once see that he is about to have a soft
> head.<span id="page_260_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_260_note_4) It is
> difficult for them to see the truth; they continually talk nonsense,
> and make false statements, until all the man's cattle are devoured at
> their command, they saying that the spirit of his people demands
> cattle, that it may eat food.
>
>  So the people readily assent to the diviners' word, thinking that
> they know. At length all the man's property is expended, he being
> still ill; and they no longer <span id="page_261">p. 261</span> know
> what to do, for he has no more cattle, and his friends help him in
> such things as he needs.
>
>  At length an inyanga comes and says that all the others are wrong. He
> says, "I know that you come here to me because you have been unable to
> do any thing for the man, and have no longer the heart to believe that
> any inyanga can help you. But, my friends, I see that my friends, the
> other izinyanga, have gone astray. They have not eaten impepo.<span
> id="page_261_fr_5"></span>[5](#page_261_note_5) They were not
> initiated in a proper way. Why have they been mistaken, when the
> disease is evident? For my part, I tell you the izinyanga have
> troubled you. The disease does not require to be treated with
> blood.<span id="page_261_fr_6"></span>[6](#page_261_note_6) As for the
> man, I see nothing else but that he is possessed by the Itongo.<span
> id="page_261_fr_7"></span>[7](#page_261_note_7) There is nothing else.
> He is possessed by an Itongo. Your people<span
> id="page_261_fr_8"></span>[8](#page_261_note_8) move in him. They are
> divided into two <span id="page_262">p. 262</span> parties; some say,
> 'No, we do not wish that our child should be injured. We do not wish
> it.' It is for that reason and no other that he does not get well. If
> you bar the way against the Itongo, you will be killing him. For he
> will not be an inyanga; neither will he ever be a man again; he will
> be what he is now. If he is not ill, he will be delicate, and become a
> fool, and be unable to understand any thing. I tell you you will kill
> him by using medicines. Just leave him alone, and look to the end to
> which the disease points. Do you not see that on the day he has not
> taken medicine, he just takes a mouthful of food?<span
> id="page_262_fr_9"></span>[9](#page_262_note_9) Do not give him any
> more medicines. He will not die of the sickness, for he will have what
> is good<span id="page_262_fr_10"></span>[10](#page_262_note_10) given
> to him."
>
>  So the man may be ill two years without getting better; perhaps even
> longer than that. He may leave the house for a few days, and the
> people begin to think he will get well. But no, he is confined to the
> house again. This continues until his hair falls off. And his body is
> dry and scurfy; and he does not like to anoint himself. People wonder
> at the progress of the disease. <span id="page_263">p. 263</span> But
> his head begins to give signs of what is about to happen. He shows
> that he is about to be a diviner by yawning<span
> id="page_263_fr_11"></span>[11](#page_263_note_11) again and again,
> and by sneezing again and again. And men say, "No! Truly it seems as
> though this man was about to be possessed by a spirit." This is also
> apparent from his being very fond of snuff; not allowing any long time
> to pass without taking some. And people begin to see that he has had
> what is good given to him.
>
>  After that he is ill; he has slight convulsions, and has water poured
> on him, and they cease for a time. He habitually sheds tears, at first
> slight, and at last he weeps aloud, and in the middle of the night,
> when the people are asleep, he is heard making a noise, and wakes the
> people by singing; he has composed a song, and men and women awake and
> go to sing in concert with him.
>
>  In this state of things they daily expect his death;<span
> id="page_263_fr_12"></span>[12](#page_263_note_12) he is now <span
> id="page_264">p. 264</span> but skin and bones, and they think that
> to-morrow's sun will not leave him alive. The people wonder when they
> hear him singing, and they strike their hands in concert. They then
> begin to take courage, saying, "Yes; now we see that it is the
> head."<span id="page_264_fr_13"></span>[13](#page_264_note_13)
>
>  Therefore whilst he is undergoing this initiation the people of the
> village are troubled by want of sleep; for a man who is beginning to
> be an inyanga causes great trouble, for he does not sleep, but works
> constantly with his brain; his sleep is merely by snatches, and he
> wakes up singing many songs; and people who are near quit their
> villages by night when they hear him singing aloud, and go to sing in
> concert. Perhaps he sings till the morning, no one having slept. The
> people of the village smite their hands in concert till they are sore.
> And then he leaps about the house like a frog; and the house becomes
> too small for him, and he goes out, leaping and singing, and shaking
> like a reed in the water, and dripping with perspiration.
>
>  At that time many cattle are eaten. The people encourage his becoming
> an inyanga; they employ means for making the Itongo white, that it may
> make his divination very clear. At length <span id="page_265">p.
> 265</span> another ancient inyanga of celebrity is pointed out to
> him.<span id="page_265_fr_14"></span>[14](#page_265_note_14) At night
> whilst asleep he is commanded by the Itongo, who says to him, "Go to
> So-and-so; go to him, and he will churn for you emetic-ubulawo,<span
> id="page_265_fr_15"></span>[15](#page_265_note_15) that you may be an
> inyanga altogether." Then he is quiet for a few days, having gone to
> the inyanga to have ubulawo churned for him; and he comes back quite
> another man, being now cleansed and an inyanga indeed.
>
>  And if he is to have familiar spirits, there is continually a voice
> saying to him, "You will not speak with the people; they will be told
> by us every thing they come to enquire about." And he continually
> tells the people his dreams, saying, "There are people<span
> id="page_265_fr_16"></span>[16](#page_265_note_16) who tell me at
> night that they will speak for themselves to those who come to
> enquire." At last all this turns out to be true; when he has begun to
> divine, at length his power entirely ceases, and he hears the spirits
> who speak by whistlings<span
> id="page_265_fr_17"></span>[17](#page_265_note_17) speaking to him,
> and he answers them as he would answer a man; and he causes them to
> speak by asking them questions; if he does not understand <span
> id="page_266">p. 266</span> what they say, they make him understand
> every thing they see. The familiar spirits do not begin by explaining
> omens which occur among the people; they begin by speaking with him
> whose familiars they are, and making him acquainted with what is about
> to happen, and then he divines for the people.
>
>  This then is what I know of familiar spirits and diviners.
>
>  If the relatives of the man who has been made ill by the Itongo do
> not wish him to become a diviner, they call a great doctor to treat
> him, to lay the spirit, that he may not divine. But although the man
> no longer divines, he is not well; he continues to be always out of
> health. This is what I know. But although he no longer divines, as
> regards wisdom he is like a diviner. For instance, there was Undayeni.
> His friends did not wish him to become a diviner; they said, "No; we
> do not wish so fine and powerful a man to become a mere thing which
> stays at home, and does no work, but only divines." So they laid the
> spirit. But there still remained in him signs which caused the people
> to say, "If that man had been a diviner, he would have been a very
> great man, a first-class diviner."
>
> <span id="page_267">p. 267</span>
>
>  As to the familiar spirits, it is not one only that speaks; they are
> very many; and their voices are not alike; one has his voice, and
> another his; and the voice of the man into whom they enter is
> different from theirs. He too enquires of them as other people do; and
> he too seeks divination of them. If they do not speak, he does not
> know what they will say; he cannot tell those who come for divination
> what they will be told. No. It is his place to take what those who
> come to enquire bring, and nothing more. And the man and the familiar
> spirits ask questions of each other and converse.
>
>  When those who come to seek divination salute him, he replies, "O,
> you have come when I am, alone. The spirits departed yesterday. I do
> not know where they are gone." So the people wait. When they come they
> are heard saluting them, saying, "Good day." They reply, "Good day to
> you, masters." And the man who lives with them also asks them saying,
> "Are you coming?" They say, they are. It is therefore difficult to
> understand that it is a deception, when we hear many voices speaking
> with the man who has familiar spirits, and him too speaking with them.

>
>  The men ask, "What is this disease? for it resembles nothing but

>
>  He replies, "Yes, yes; I too say it is uthlabo; it is that which

>
>  At length the doctor who knows the medicines for uthlabo cures it.
> But black people call it also ukxulo,<span
> id="page_268_fr_21"></span>[21](#page_268_note_21) and say it is

> id="page_268_fr_22"></span>[22](#page_268_note_22) And when a <span
> id="page_269">p. 269</span> man is constantly affected<span
> id="page_269_fr_23"></span>[23](#page_269_note_23) by uthlabo, black
> men say the Itongo is walking in him; Amatongo are walking in his
> body. If the disease lasts a long time, they at length go to enquire

> affected by his people who are dead.<span
> id="page_269_fr_24"></span>[24](#page_269_note_24) There was one of

>
>  The diviners say, "Do not give him any more medicines. Do you not see
> when you get uthlabo-medicines for him, the disease does not cease?
> When you give him medicine, do you not thereby increase the disease?
> Leave him alone. His people are in him. They wish him to dream."

> id="page_272">p. 272</span> him to become a white<span
> id="page_272_fr_28"></span>[28](#page_272_note_28) inyanga. Be quiet,
> and see if the Amatongo do not give him commands at night in his

>  Some dispute and say, "No. The fellow is merely mad. There is no

>
>  The others say, "No; he is mad. Have you ever hidden things for him

>
>  They say, "No; we have not done that."
>
>  They ask, "How then do you know he is an inyanga?"
>
>  They say, "We know it because he is told about medicines, which he

>
>  They reply, "O! he is a mere madman. We might allow that he is an

>
>  As they are talking thus and disputing about concealing things <span
> id="page_274">p. 274</span> for him to find, at night when he is
> asleep he dreams that the man of his people who is dead, and who is
> causing him to begin to be an inyanga, tells him saying, "They were

>
>  He replies, "They say you are not an inyanga, but a mere mad man; and
> ask if they have hidden things for you to discover, since the others
> say you are an inyanga."
>
>  He says, "Tell me who they are who say so."
>
>  He replies, "So-and-so and So-and-so were disputing."
>
>  The man asks, "Do you say they lie when they say so?"
>
>  He replies, "Be quiet. Because they say so, I say you shall be a

>
>  The man who is beginning to be be an inyanga says, "For my part I say
> they speak the truth when they say I am mad. Truly they have never
> hidden anything for me to find."
>
>  Then the man who was an inyanga, <span id="page_275">p. 275</span> he
> who is initiating him, says, "Just be quiet. I will take you to them
> in the morning. And you appear on a hill; do not come upon them
> suddenly; but appear on a hill which is concealed, and cry 'Hai, hai,

> When you cry 'Hai, hai, hai,' if they do not hear, then go on to a

>
>  So he does so. He cries "Hai, hai, hai," on a hill which is hidden;
> they do not hear him distinctly; they hear only a continual sound of

> id="page_275_fr_31"></span>[31](#page_275_note_31) One of them says,
> "It sounds as though there was some one singing." Others say, "We do
> not hear. We hear only an echo."
>
>  The Itongo comes to him and tells him that they cannot hear, <span
> id="page_276">p. 276</span> and bids him go out a little on the open
> hill, and then return again to the hill which is hidden.
>
>  So he departs at the word of the Itongo, and goes out to the open
> hill, and cries "Hai, hai, hai;" and they all hear that it is he. They
> are again disputing about him, and as soon as they hear that it is he,
> they say, "Can it be, sirs, that he comes about the matter we were
> disputing about, saying, he is mad?"
>
>  Others<span id="page_276_fr_32"></span>[32](#page_276_note_32) say,
> "O, why do you ask? He comes on that account, if indeed you said he
> was not an inyanga, but a madman."
>
>  The great man of the village to which the inyanga is approaching,
> says, "I too say he is mad. Just take things and go and hide them,
> that we may see if he can find them."
>
>  They take things; one takes beads, and goes and hides them; others
> take picks, and go and hide them; others hide assagais; others
> bracelets; others hide their sticks, others their kilts, others their
> ornaments, others their pots; others hide baskets, and say, "Just let
> us see if he will find all these <span id="page_277">p. 277</span>
> things or not." Others hide cobs of maize; others the ears of amabele,
> or sweet cane, or of ujiba, or the heads of upoko.
>
>  Some say, "O, if he find all these things, will he not be tired? Why
> have you hidden so many?"
>
>  They say, "We hide so many that we may see that he is really an
> inyanga."
>
>  They reply, "Stop now; you have hidden very many things."
>
>  They return home, and wait. Then the Itongo tells him on the
> concealed hill; for it had already said to him, "Keep quiet; they are
> now hiding things; do not begin to appear. They wish to say when you
> find the things that you saw when they hid them. Be quiet, that they
> may hide all the things; then they will be satisfied that you are an
> inyanga." Now the Itongo tells him, "They have now hidden the things,
> and gone home. It is proper for you now to go to the home of the
> people who say you are mad and not an inyanga."
>
>  So he comes out on the open mountain, and runs towards their home,
> being pursued by his own people who are seeking him, for he went out
> during the night, and <span id="page_278">p. 278</span> they did not
> hear when he went out very early in the morning, when it was still

>
>  He says to them, "Have you then hid things for me to find?"
>
>  They deny, saying, "No; we have not hidden things for you to find."
>
>  He says, "You have."
>
>  They deny, saying, "It is not true; we have not."
>
>  He says, "Am I not able to find<span

>
>  They say, "No; you cannot. Have we hidden then things for you to

>
>  He says, "You have."
>
>  They deny, declaring that they have not done so. But he asserts that

>
>  When they persist in their denial, <span id="page_279">p. 279</span>
> he starts up, shaking his head. He goes and finds the beads; he finds
> the picks, and the kilts, and the bracelets; he finds the cobs of
> maize, and the ears of the amabele and ujiba and of upoko; he finds

>
>  He goes home again as soon as he has found all the things, and not

>
>  The inyanga's people who accompany him say, "Just tell us if he is

>
>  And he says, "I have found all the things whieh you hid; there is

>
>  Then the people make him presents. One comes with beads and gives

> *The Account of Ukanzi.*

T<span class="small">HE</span> following narrative gives an interesting
and striking instance of the power a bold man may possess even over
venomous snakes. The snakes caught by the diviners and hung in festoons
about their bodies, are probably charmed in some such manner as here
related of Ukanzi. It is quite possible that both possessed medicines
which are either offensive or pleasing to snakes, by which they caused
them to be afraid or gentle. But it is not necessary to suppose that
Ukanzi used any such medicines; the mere daring and yet cautious
coolness with which he approached the snake is quite sufficient to
explain why it became so cowed before him. But how are we to explain his
insusceptibility to the snake poison? Why did the poisoned fangs broken
off and remaining in his lips produce no symptoms? It is likely that he
was naturally insusceptible to the influence of such animal poisons,
just as others possess a natural intense susceptibility to it, so that
the sting of a bee has in them been followed by fatal consequences. This
is much more likely, than that he possessed any powerful remedies by the
use of which he rendered the snake poison innocuous. The son inherited
the same insusceptibility. Of course all statements as to the invariable
efficacy of some particular remedy possessed by savages, must be
received with great caution; and if subjected to rigid enquiry would
probably prove not to be founded in well-observed facts.

> T<span class="small">HE</span> account of Ukanzi, the son of Unjoko,
> and of his knowledge of snake-poison.
>
>  He is a man who causes us to wonder much at his knowledge. There is
> no one in our country like him who can render inert the poison of
> snakes; he is a man trusted to the uttermost in cases of snake-bites.
>
>  If any one is bitten by any kind of snake, he does not say he <span
> id="page_306">p. 306</span> does not possess the remedy<span
> id="page_306_fr_65"></span>[65](#page_306_note_65) for that kind of
> snake-poison. No; for his part he is only gladdened by all kinds of
> snakes; nothing prevents his curing the bite of any of them. If a man
> is said to have been bitten by some deadly snake, he at once selects
> the proper remedy.
>
>  And he continually separates the remedy for the poison which is in
> the body, and that which is in the viscera, and keeps them distinct.
>
>  A proof that he is a doctor is that the snakes which he catches are
> to him no more than mice. I once saw this with my own eyes, and did
> not merely hear it by report. He caught a great snake called
> Umdhlambila, the rock imamba, when we were hunting. When we, the
> hunting party, came under a precipice, there was a snake in a tree
> basking in the sun. We saw it occupying the whole tree; it was of a
> grey colour; its eyes were piercing; it was fearful when it looked at
> any one.
>
>  We called him, saying, "Here is your game!" He came running and
> asking where it was. We pointed it out, and he saw it. He laid his
> weapons on the ground, and climbed the tree and went to it. I said in
> my heart, "I shall now see. <span id="page_307">p. 307</span> For
> since he has not taken a stick, what will he do to this snake which is
> as large as a post?<span
> id="page_307_fr_66"></span>[66](#page_307_note_66) Will it not devour
> him?"<span id="page_307_fr_67"></span>[67](#page_307_note_67) He <span
> id="page_308">p. 308</span> put his hand in his mouth and gently bit
> it all over; he took it <span id="page_309">p. 309</span> out and
> extended it towards the snake; it started and raised its head, and
> turned in every direction, wishing to escape. But his hand followed it
> constantly wherever it went on the tree. When I thought it would
> strike him on his head, he withdrew himself and it did nothing; and
> then raised his hand again; at length it became gentle, and laid its
> head in his hand, not placing it there in a hostile manner, but laying
> its head with all gentleness in his hand, and letting him do what he
> liked with it. He seized its head, and put it in his mouth, and chewed
> it; the snake's teeth broke in his mouth; he picked out the teeth when
> he had killed the snake, and nothing happened; it was as if he picked
> out thorns merely; he took no medicine to counteract the poison; he
> merely picked out the teeth.
>
>  We who were standing on the ground wondered, and said Ukanzi was a
> sorcerer. He drew the snake towards himself, and twisted it round his
> body, and came down with it. He got some grass and tied the snake up
> in it, and went home with it, saying, "For my part I have now killed
> my game; I shall prepare it at home." So he carried it away.
>
>  And his son Ugidinga resembles <span id="page_310">p. 310</span> his
> father in his power of catching snakes, he having learnt of his
> father.
>
>  When he reached home with the snake, he skinned it, and separated the
> skin and the flesh, and selected different portions of the body; he
> roasted it that it might not decay, but dry; he boiled it with other
> snake-poison remedies. The heart was set aside by itself; and the body
> by itself; and he had thus two remedies—that obtained from the heart,
> and that from the body.
>
>  If a man walking with Ukanzi were bitten by a snake, he would give

> But at length he saw when they had gone a great distance and nothing

>
>  But as to his knowledge, no one knew by what means he cured all kinds

>
>  He was a very active doctor; he hopped about the whole house like a

>
>  But the izinyanga of the present time are said no longer to resemble

> And they said. But as they have no mouth they speak thus:—If they say

>
>  Their mode of speaking is this:—If it is asked where the disease has

> he mentions the name to them; if it is he they mean, they jump up and

>

> does not know what it means.
>
>  The owner of the bones manages them all properly. When one in falling
> rests on another—if for instance it is the bone of an elephant and of
> the hyena—he says, "What does the elephant and hyena say?" And
> afterwards by his management of the bones, he tells the enquirer that

> that.
>
>  And the man replies, "Yes; the bones mention that for which I came
> here."
>
>  Then the owner of the bones says to the man, "Just take them
> yourself, and ask them why it is so."
>
>  He throws them down, and the owner then manages them properly, <span
> id="page_334">p. 334</span> and tells him what the bones say; he says,
> "You see this bone standing in this manner; it speaks of a certain
> matter in your village. This says you must do so-and-so." They say
> every thing the man knows.
>
>  And a person by accustoming himself to divine with bones, himself
> manages them properly; from that proper management the matter is made

>
>  I myself once went to enquire of the bones. There was a goat of

*Dungeka.—Ukudunga* is to stir up mud in water, so as to make the water
turbid, or muddy; and is hence applied by metaphor to <span
id="footnotes_page_260">p. 260</span> confusion or muddling of mind by
trouble,—disturbance of a family or a village by contention and
quarrelling, and, as above, to general derangement of the body from
disease. (Compare M<span class="small">UDDLE</span>, *Wedgwood's
Dictionary of English Etymology*.) From this word we have the compounds
*Idungamuzi*, A stirrer up of strife in a village, or Village-muddler;
and *Idungandhlu*, A stirrer up of strife in a house, or House-muddler.

 <span id="page_261_note_5"></span>[5](#page_261_fr_5) *Impepo* is of
two kinds—white and black.

 The *black* is first used as an emetic to remove all badness and causes
of dimness from the system.

 The *white* is burnt as incense when sacrificing to the Amatongo;
izinyanga use it as an emetic to prevent the return of dimness of the
inner sight after the use of the black impepo; they also eat it; and
place it under their heads at night, that they may have clear, truthful
dreams. They believe that by the use of this medicine they are enabled
to divine with accuracy. Hence to have "eaten impepo" means to be a
trustworthy diviner.

 <span id="page_268_note_22"></span>[22](#page_268_fr_22) We may compare
the following faith in evil Nats, which seem to hold very much the same
position in the East as the Amatongo among the Amazulu:—

 "The Nats or Dewatas play a conspicuous part in the affairs of this
world. Their seats are in the six lower heavens, forming, with the abode
of man and the four states of punishment, the eleven seats of passions.
But they often quit their respective places, and interfere <span
id="footnotes_page_269">p. 269</span> with the chief events that take
place among men. Hence we see them ever attentive in ministering to all
the wants of the future Budha. Besides, they are made to watch over
trees, forests, villages, towns, cities, fountains, rivers, &c. These
are the good and benevolent Nats. This world is also supposed to be
peopled with wicked Nats, whose nature is ever prone to the evil. A good
deal of the worship of Budhists consists in superstitious ceremonies and
offerings made for propitiating the wicked Nats, and obtaining favours
and temporal advantages from the good ones. Such a worship is universal,
and fully countenanced by the Talapoins, though in opposition with the
real doctrines of genuine Budhism. All kinds of misfortunes are
attributed to the malignant interference of the evil Nats. In case of
severe illness that has resisted the skill of native medical art, the
physician gravely tells the patient and his relatives that it is useless
to have recourse any longer to medicines, but a conjuror must be sent
for, to drive out the malignant spirit who is the author of the
complaint. Meanwhile directions are given for the erection of a shed,
where offerings intended for the inimical Nat are deposited. A female
relative of the patient begins dancing to the sound of musical
instruments. The dance goes on at first in rather a quiet manner, but it
gradually grows more animated, until it reaches the acme of animal
phrenzy. At that moment the bodily strength of the dancing lady becomes
exhausted; she drops on the ground in a state of apparent faintness. She
is then approached by the conjuror, who asks her if the invisible foe
has relinquished his hold over the diseased. Having been answered in the
affirmative, he bids the physician to give medicines to the patient,
assuring him that his remedies will now act beneficially for restoring
the health of the sick, since their action will meet no further
opposition from the wicked Nat." (*The Life or Legend of Gaudama, the
Budha of the Burmese. P. Bigandet, p.* 71. Comp. also p. 537.)

 <span id="page_270_note_26"></span>[26](#page_270_fr_26)
*Ukumbulula*.—Sorcerers are supposed to destroy their victims by taking
some portion of their bodies, as hair or nails; or something that has
been worn next their person, as a piece of an old garment, and adding to
it certain medicines, which is then buried in some secret place. They
are at once the subjects of disease, and suffer and die. The power
alluded to above is that of discovering and digging up this poison. Very
similar to the practice of sorcerers amongst ourselves, who used to make
an image of wax or clay of the person they wished to kill, and treat it
with poisons, &c:, and every thing done to the image was felt by their
victim.

 The following account is given among Danish Traditions:—

 "In a certain house everything went perversely; for which reason the
inhabitants sent to a well-known wise woman. She came and went about the
house both within and without. At last she stood <span
id="footnotes_page_271">p. 271</span> still before a large stone, which
lay just without the dwelling. 'This,' said she, 'should be rolled
away.' But all that they could do with levers and other means was to no
purpose: the stone would not move. At length the wise woman herself
hobbled up to the stone, and scarcely had she touched it before it moved
from its old station. Beneath was found a silken purse filled with the
claws of cocks and eagles, human hair and nails. 'Put it into the fire
together with a good bundle of pea-straw, that it may catch quickly,'
said the old woman; and no sooner was this said than done. But the
moment the fire began to take effect it began to howl and hiss as if the
very house were ready to fall, and people who stood out in the fields
hard by plainly saw a witch sally forth on her broomstick from the mouth
of the oven. At the same moment the old woman died, who, it was
supposed, had bewitched the house, and all the sorcery was at an end."
(*Northern Mythology. Benjamin Thorpe. Vol. II., p.* 189.)

 <span id="page_271_note_27"></span>[27](#page_271_fr_27) That is, an
Itongo who shall influence for good, and enable him to see *clearly* and
help others. They also speak of an Itongo elimnyama, a dark or black
Itongo, that is, one that is jealous, and when he visits any one causes
disease and suffering without giving any reason for his doing so. It is
said, "Li lwe li tulile," that is, It fights in silence,—contends with
people without telling them what to do to pacify it. They suppose that
sorcerers are aided by the Amatongo of their house to practise sorcery
with skill and effect; but such Amatongo are not said to be black or
dark, but white, because they reveal with clearness their will to their
devotee.

 <span id="page_280_note_38"></span>[38](#page_280_fr_38) *Ibuda*, a
diviner; but for the most part an epithet of contempt, and used pretty
much in the same way and spirit as Ahab's servant applied the term "mad
fellow" to the young prophet that anointed Jehu. ([2 Kings ix.
11](../../bib/kjv/kg2.htm#9:11).) It is derived from *ukubuda*, to talk
recklessly, or not to the point; also to dream falsely.

 It is interesting to note that in Abyssinia we meet with the word
*Bouda*, applied to a character more resembling the Abatakati or Wizards
of these parts. To the *Bouda* is attributed remarkable power of doing
evil; he invariably selects for his victims "those possessed of youth
and talent, beauty and wit, on whom to work his evil <span
id="footnotes_page_281">p. 281</span> deeds." His powers are varied. "At
one time he will enslave the objects of his malice; at another, he will
subject them to nameless torments; and not unfrequently his vengeance
will even compass their death." The *Bouda*, or an evil spirit called by
the same name, and acting with him, takes possession of others, giving
rise to an attack known under the name of "Bouda symptoms," which
present the characteristics of intense hysteria, bordering on insanity.
Together with the *Bouda* there is, of course, the exorcist, who has
unusual powers, and, like the *inyanga yokubula* or diviner among the
Amazulu, points out those who are *Boudas*, that is, Abatakati. An
exorcist will suddenly make his appearance "amongst a convivial party of
friends, and pronounce the mystical word *Bouda*. The uncouth appearance
and sepulchral voice of the exorcist everywhere produce the deepest
sensation, and young and old, men and women, gladly part with some
article to get rid of his hated and feared presence. If, as sometimes
happens, one or two less superstitious individuals object to these
wicked exactions, the exorcist has a right to compel every one present
to smell an abominable concoction of foul herbs and decayed bones, which
he carries in his pouch; those who unflinchingly inhale the offensive
scent are declared innocent, and those who have no such strong olfactory
nerves are declared *Boudas*, and shunned as allies of the Evil One." It
was the custom formerly to execute hundreds of suspected *Boudas*.

p.* 152-161.)

 <span id="page_281_note_39"></span>[39](#page_281_fr_39) *Inyanga
yokubula*.—*Inyanga* is one possessed of some particular skill or
knowledge, as that of a smith, or carpenter; or of medicine:—*inyanga
yemiti*, one skilled in medicine, a doctor of medicine; it is applied to
especial departments—*inyanga yezilonda*, a sore-doctor; *inyanga
yonzimba-mubi*, an abscess-doctor, &c. *Inyanga yokubula* is a person
skilled in divination. He is so called from the custom of using branches
of trees to *smite* the ground with during the consultation. These rods
are called *izibulo*, because they are used to smite (*bula*) the ground
with; hence *ukubula* comes to mean to *consult* a diviner by means of
*rods*, that is, by smiting the ground; and to divine or reveal what is
asked. This beating of the ground appears to have two objects: first, to
be a means of expressing assent or otherwise on the part of those who
are enquiring; second, to excite them and throw them off their guard. By
these means the diviner knows when he is following a right clue; and is
able to keep their attention from himself. It is also quite possible
that it may also produce an exalted or mesmeric condition of mind in the
diviner.

Large animals, which are supposed to have been used by some one to
produce the disease from which he is suffering. These are the
*Inhluzele*, the Harte-beest. That this has been used with other
medicines as a poison is known by bloody micturition and <span
id="footnotes_page_287">p. 287</span> other symptoms. The *Indhlovu*,
Elephant, which is known to have been used by excessive borborygmus. The
*Isambane*, or Ant-bear, by pain in the hip-joint, as though the femur
were dislocated; possibly, sciatica. When a man is suffering from such
symptoms it is said, *U nenyamazane*, He has a disease occasioned by a
wild animal; or the disease may be distinguished,—*U nenhluzele, U
nendlhlovu, U nesambane*, He has harte-beest, that is, the disease
occasioned by it; He has elephant; He has ant-bear,—that is, the
diseases occasioned by them. To cure these diseases the natives act on
the homœopathic principle, and administer the wild beast that is
supposed to have occasioned the disease, with other medicines.

 <span id="page_287_note_46"></span>[46](#page_287_fr_46) *He has
Umsizi.—Umsizi* is a disease occurring among the Amalala, and said not
to be known to the Amazulu or Amakxosa. It is supposed to arise from the
administration of medicine, in this way. A man is suspicious of his
wife's fidelity. He goes to a doctor of celebrity,—an umsizi-doctor,—and
obtains of him medicine, which he takes himself without his wife's
knowledge, and by cohabiting with her once conveys to her the seed of
disease. And if any one is guilty of illicit intercourse with her after
this, he will have umsizi; the wife all the time remaining quite free
from disease. The symptoms of umsizi are intense darkening of the skin,
and contraction of the tendons with excessive pain; severe pain in a
finger or a toe, from which it shifts to different parts of the body,
especially the joints.

 *Umsizi* is also the medicine used for treating the disease. It
consists of various substances,—plants, their roots, bark, and seeds;
animals, their flesh, skin, tendons, entrails, bones, and excrements;
and stones.

 These substances are partially charred, not reduced to ashes, so as to
destroy their virtue, but sufficiently to admit of their being powdered.

 The medicine is used for the most part endermically by rubbing it into
scarifications, It is also mixed with other medicines to make an
*izembe*.

 *Umsizi ozwakalayo*, Umsizi which is felt.—This term is applied to the
medicine used to make a man sensitive to the existence of that state in
the woman which can produce the disease called umsizi. It is also
applied to that condition of body which renders him thus sensitive.
*Umsizi ozwakalayo* is a kind of umsizi, which the doctor supplies to a
person to be used as a trial medicine. It is rubbed into scarifications
made on the back of the left hand. If his wife or another woman whom he
approaches is in that state which is capable of conveying to him the
disease called umsizi, when he places his hand on her thigh, the hand is
at once affected by spasmodic contraction of the fingers. And he
abstains from her until she has undergone a course of treatment.

 Or it is rubbed in on either side of the Tendo Achillis; and the <span
id="footnotes_page_288">p. 288</span> man touches her with his foot or
toe. If she can affect him with umsizi, the leg at once is affected with
spasm.

 It is from the dread of this disease that a man will not marry a widow
until she has been subjected to medical treatment to remove all
possibility of her communicating it.

 <span id="page_307_note_67"></span>[67](#page_307_fr_67) The following
account is taken from the *St. James's Magazine*:

 "In the course of a country ramble, some Europeans fell in with a
company of Eisowys bound for Tangier. A halt was called under a
spreading fig-tree at the foot of which ran a delightful little stream.
The snake-basket was emptied out on the ground, and the performance was
carried on much in the way just described. While the operator was
washing his wounds, and spitting out blood enough to discolour the
stream, some one suggested that it was all a sham, and that the snakes
had not poison enough among them to kill a sparrow. On this being
interpreted to the proprietor, who was by this time up to his knees in
the water, trying to wash away the traces of his last experiment, he
very considerately offered to place his basket at the disposal of any
one who might be inclined to take his first lesson in snake-charming.
There was a pause; for it was suddenly remembered that a luckless
Portuguese had once tried the experiment, and had to suffer the loss of
one of his arms by amputation, as a memorial of his temerity. Meanwhile
the snakes were indulging themselves in a merry wriggle on the grass,
and nobody was sufficiently devoted to the interests of science to
disturb their sports. There the matter would have ended, but for a happy
thought. 'Fetch a fowl,' cried one of the Europeans, and away scampered
a native servant to buy one. By way of improving the time a lean-flanked
Eisowy, who had hitherto contemplated what was going on with a sulky
air, roused himself up and declared his readiness to eat a snake for a
suitable consideration. The offer was sensational, and the required
amount was subscribed, on condition that he should eat a snake to be
chosen by the Europeans. Bang went the tambourine louder than ever, and
up jumped the Eisowy, incumbered with nothing heavier than his skin and
drawers, and looking hungry enough to eat the snakes, basket and all.
Long and anxious was the consultation of the Europeans, as to which was
the nastiest and most venomous of the snakes. The Leffa, which had
bitten the man so badly, was to be reserved for an experiment on the
fowl; so the choice fell on a speckly monster of most alarming vitality.
No sooner was the selection proclaimed, than the operatar seized him by
the tail, which he instantly thrust into his mouth with the manifest
intention of making a hearty meal. Before it was possible to rush
forward and stop the disgusting exhibition, the Eisowy had shown himself
so much in earnest about his work, that he had drawn in several inches
of the reptile, chewing away violently at the unsavoury morsel. There
was no standing such a loathsome sight, so one of his companions was
hastily bribed to snatch the writhing serpent from his hands. It was
impossible to make him comprehend that the exhibition <span
id="footnotes_page_308">p. 308</span> was not agreeable. He evidently
thought that there was some mistake about the snake, and to show that he
was equal to the emergency, he most obligingly proposed that another
selection should be made, and, on this being declined, he undertook, for
a further consideration, to find a wild one, and eat him on the spot.
Somewhat chagrined at the signs of disapprobation with which his
suggestion was received, and thinking that he was in duty bound to do
something for his money, he produced an iron skewer, and thrust it
through his cheek, making it appear on the other side of his face. This
was an evident relief to his feelings, for he drew out the skewer, wiped
it on the grass, and squatted on his haunches with the air of a public
benefactor. The truth is, that the habits of these men are so temperate,
and they have so little spare flesh on their bones, that there is
nothing for inflammation to fasten on. It is likely enough that if the
spectators had not had enough of this sensational kind of exlubition,
another famished-looking Eisowy would have made good his promise to eat
a handful of nails or broken glass, at the option of the company. The
capacity of these men for eating seems to be limited by none of the laws
which regulate the appetites of ordinary mortals."

 The same power is also found among the Chinese:—

 "Behind a counter is seen an itinerant doctor, dilating on the virtues
of an antidote against the bite of serpents; one of his coadjutors is
actually putting the head of the *cobra capella*, or hooded snake, into
his mouth, while a less intrepid, but equally useful assistant, is
exchanging the miraculous drug for *cash*, or *tseen*. The great
impostor himself, mounted on a stool, his head protected by a conical
hat of split bamboo, a vestment of thick, coarse, compact cloth
enclosing his arms, and a similar covering being secured around his
waist by a silken girdle, holds a serpent in one hand, and the antidote
to its venomous bite in the other;

<table data-align="center">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>'Thus is he doubly arm'd with death and life:<br />
The bane and antidote are both before him.'</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

So perfect is the education of this mischievous reptile, that it essays
to bite its owner, and submits to disappointment with the appearance of
reluctance. Having proved that this particular enemy of mankind still
retains its propensity to injury in the most entire manner, and requires
to be guarded against with caution, the doctor takes a medicated ball
from one of the packets with which the counter is strewn, and, when the
snake renews its attempts, presents the ball to it, upon which it
instantly recoils, and endeavours to escape from his grasp. Should this
demonstration be insufficient, the efficacy of the charm is still more
convincingly established by merely rubbing the forehead, cheek, hand, or
any other unprotected part with the antidote, and presenting it to the
reptile, which appears to retreat with the same dislike and
precipitation as when the entire ball was shown to it." (*China, in a
Series of Views, &c. By Thomas Allom, Esq., and the Rev. G. N. Wright,
M.A. Vol. II., p.* 14.)

<span id="footnotes_page_314">p. 314</span>

 <span id="page_314_note_68"></span>[68](#page_314_fr_68) *Ukuvimba* is
to stop, to put a stopper in a bottle. The natives say, *Uku m vimba
umuntu*, To stop a man, as though there was some opening by which the
Itongo had access. Or *Ukuvimbu itongo*, or *Uku m vimba itongo*, or
*Ukuvimbela umuntu*,—all of which various modes of expressing the same
thing may be translated by our phrase, "to lay a ghost or spirit."

 In Jón Arnason's *Icelandic Legends*, translated by Powell and
Magnússon, we find numerous allusions to ghosts and methods of laying
them. One Ketill, having found the corpse of an old woman lying in the
road, passed by without paying the least attention to it. The next night
and every night after, the old woman visited him in his dreams, assuming
a horrible and threatening aspect, and hounding him on to an untimely
grave. (*P*. 159.) A man lays the ghost of his deceased friend by
pouring a keg of brandy on his grave to moisten his "dry old bones," of
which the ghost complained. (*P*. 160.) "The boy who did not know what
fear was" has a stand-up fight with a giant-goblin, whom he manages to
detain till "the first ray of dawn," which striking the goblin's eyes,
he sinks into the ground in two pieces, and is for ever prevented from
rising again by two crosses driven into the places where the two parts
disappeared. (*P*. 165.) Some are laid by extorting a promise from them
not to appear again. "The deacon of Myrká" haunts his betrothed, as the
ghosts of the Amazulu do their wives, and all means for laying the
spirit having failed, even the reading of psalms by the priest, they
send for a man <span id="footnotes_page_315">p. 315</span> skilled in
witcheraft, who seizes the deacon's ghost, uttering potent spells, and
forces him beneath a stone, and there he lies to this day. (*P*. 177.)
Grímur lays the very substantial ghost of Skeljúngur by fastening him to
a rock; and when the ghost went away with it, cut off his head and burnt
him, and cast the ashes into a well. (*P*. 199.)

 Another plan of getting rid of goblins is to outwit them by setting
them about some task which is impossible to be fulfilled, as spinning
ropes of sand.—Hothershall Hall, near Ribchester, is said to have been
troubled by the nightly visits of a goblin; but the goblin "is
understood to have been 'laid' under the roots of a large laurel tree at
the end of the house, and will not be able to molest the family so long
as the tree exists. It is a common opinion in that part of the country
that the roots have to be moistened with milk on certain occasions, in
order to prolong its existence, and also to preserve the power of the
spell under which the goblin is laid. None but the Roman Catholic
priesthood are supposed to have the power of 'laying an evil spirit,'
and hence they have always the honour to be cited in our local legends."
(*Lancashire Folk-lore. John Harland, F.S.A., and T. T. Wilkinson,
F.R.A.S., p.* 57.)

disease supposed to be caused by the Itongo.

 <span id="page_315_note_70"></span>[70](#page_315_fr_70) Here again we
have a superstition analagous with what we find in our own country. To
charm warts away, a piece of flesh is stolen and rubbed on the warts,
and then buried; or a number of pebbles, corresponding with the number
of warts, is placed in a bag, which is thrown over the back. But in
neither case will the charm work if the person "looks back till he gets
home."

 <span id="page_327_note_77"></span>[77](#page_327_fr_77) *A doctor of
the thumb*, or *thumb-doctor*,—so called because he cannot proceed
without the assistance of those who enquire, which they give either by
silence or striking the ground gently with the *izibulo* or
divining-rods, when he is not correct; or by assenting by saying "Hear"
or "True," and by striking the ground violently, and by *pointing to the
diviner in a peculiar way with the thumb*, when he is correct.

 The diviners are separated into four classes:—

 1.—*Thumb-doctors*, in whom no great confidence is placed.

 2.—Diviners who have eaten *impepo*, that is, who possess a real gift
of divination, and who are able to divine without any help from the
enquirers.

 3.—Those who use *bones* or *sticks* in divination. The bones are
called simply *amatambo*, and are obtained from various wild animals.
The doctors who employ them are called *bone-diviners*. The sticks used
are about a foot long, and are called *omabukula-izinti*, or in the
singular, *umabukula-izinti*, which is a compound word: *ukuti bukula*
is to lie down gently and comfortably,—*uma*, when; "When the sticks lie
down gently," that is, the diviner receives intimation by the mode in
which the sticks act. Such a diviner is called a *stick-diviner*. The
natives place much confidence in these doctors.

 4.—Those who have *familiar spirits*. The people have much confidence
also in these, especially because they are not able to comprehend the
source of the voices which appear to come from invisible beings. It is
supposed that this mode of divination is of modern origin.

deer be cooked when I awake, you shall have but what you can take off
his head, and by all you have ever seen do not take out the head.'

 "They were tormented by hunger, and they did not know what they should
do. They saw a little shaggy man coming down from the mountain. 'Ye are
in extremity,' said he, himself; 'why are ye not tasting what is in the
cauldron?'

 "'We are not,' said they; 'fear will not let us.'

 "They took the lid out of the end of the cauldron, when they thought it
was boiled, and so it was that there was frozen ice came upon it."

 <span id="page_340_note_87"></span>[87](#page_340_fr_87) The *isitundu*
is a narrow-mouthed vessel, made of a grass called *umsingizane* or of

heard by those who come to enquire. They are called *imilozi* from this
mode of speaking; *umlozi* is the whistling sound made by the mouth,
short of a full whistle. The natives do not call them by any term
equivalent to "familiar," but they say they are "*Amatongo a hamba

to be *amanxusa*—attendants, i. e. familiars—of the *abatakati* or

general term applied to certain medicines capable <span
id="footnotes_page_352">p. 352</span> of causing a
slough—escharotics—from *ukubozisa*, to cause to rot. But here they are
not supposed to be applied to the body, or to produce any escharotic
effect, but to be mixed with the urine of the victim, and to be thus
capable of causing her offspring to perish. Two medicines are here
mentioned—*umdhlebe* and *imbuya*; not the common *imbuya*, generally
called wild spinach, but a larger plant possessed of poisonous
qualities.

 <span id="page_352_note_9"></span>[9](#page_352_fr_9) *Sa dhlula*, i.
e. *isisu*, the word *isisu* being applied to the abdomen, to the womb,
and to that which is conceived. "The offspring passed away." The natives
use the same form of a man dying,—"*U se dhlulile*," He has now passed
away—he is dead.

Amatongo.

 <span id="page_353_note_11"></span>[11](#page_353_fr_11) That is, to
kill you; and like a warrior return with the spoil—the dead body of the
conquered.

<span id="footnotes_page_354">p. 354</span>

 <span id="page_354_note_12"></span>[12](#page_354_fr_12) Viz., the
dead,—the Amatongo.

 <span id="page_354_note_13"></span>[13](#page_354_fr_13) Compare this
contest between the contending factions of the Amatongo with the battle
of the good people, given in "The Confessions of Tom Bourke," *Croker's
Fairy Legends*.

<span id="footnotes_page_355">p. 355</span>

 <span id="page_355_note_14"></span>[14](#page_355_fr_14) It is supposed
that the Amatongo, or the dead, can die again. Here we have allusions to
their being killed in battle, and of their being carried away by the
river. See above, [p. 225, note 76](rsa06.htm#page_225_note_76).

something done by the woman, without whom they do not divine.

<span id="footnotes_page_370">p. 370</span>

 <span id="page_370_note_18"></span>[18](#page_370_fr_18) That is,
divine. Those diviners who divine by means of the *imilozi* generally
speak in a low muttering tone; and they sometimes have peculiar closed
eyes. They "peep and mutter," reminding us of [Isaiah viii.
19](../../bib/kjv/isa.htm#8:19).

<span id="footnotes_page_372">p. 372</span>

 <span id="page_372_note_19"></span>[19](#page_372_fr_19) It is a very

 <span id="page_374_note_20"></span>[20](#page_374_fr_20) The Hebrew
Ovoth, according to Gesenius, was "a soothsayer who evoked the manes of
the dead by incantations and magical songs in order to give answers as
to future and doubtful things." The demon or familiar spirit spoke in a
half-whisper, half-whistling voice; and the Septuagint render the word
by "ventriloquist," just as those who have witnessed divination by the
*inilozi* have been disposed to attribute the phenomenon to
ventriloquism.

 Among the Polynesians the ancestral spirits are believed to speak to
those who enquire of them with a similar mysterious voice, which there
too is ascribed to ventriloquism. (See *Westminster Review, No. XLII.,
April* 1862, *p*. 313.)
