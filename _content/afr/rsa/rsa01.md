## UNKULUNKULU; OR, THE TRADITION OF CREATION AS EXISTING AMONG <span class="small">THE AMAZULU AND OTHER TRIBES</span> OF <span class="small">SOUTH AFRICA.</span>

>  At length Unkulunkulu sent a lizard<span

> diseases occasioned by the Itongo.<span
> id="page_5_fr_13"></span>[13](#page_5_note_13) Unkulunkulu said, "If a

> Itongo."
>
> <span id="page_6">p. 6</span>
>
>  He said, "You will see also by night, you will dream; the Itongo will
> tell you what it is it wishes." He said, "It will also tell you the
> bullock it would have killed."
>
>  The Itongo dwells with the great man; he who dreams is the chief of
> the village; it says "Should you kill a bullock, the man will get
> well." The bullock which the Itongo mentions is killed; and although
> people were thinking that the man would die, he gets well; and so it
> is clear that the man was affected by the Itongo. The gall-bladder is
> taken from the bullock, and the man has the gall poured on him; they
> give praise and say, "In order that we may see that it is the Itongo,
> let us see him get well this very day; and at the very dawn of
> tomorrow eat meat; so we shall see that it is the Itongo. On the other
> hand, we shall not admit in our hearts that it is the Itongo; we shall
> say, it is disease only; there is no Itongo in his body. If we see
> that it is the Itongo, we shall see it by his getting well, and so we
> shall give thanks. Then we will kill many cattle, and laud the Itongo,
> and see that the Itongo of our house is good."

 In illustration and confirmation of the above I insert the following.
Returning from the Umzimkulu with a young Ibakca for my guide, I availed
myself of the opportunity to discover whether there existed among the
Amabakca the same traditions as among the Amazulu. I therefore requested
him to tell me what he knew about the tradition of the chameleon. He
told me the ordinary tale, but instead of saying it was sent by
Unkulunkulu, he said, "Kwa tunywa unwaba," There was sent a chameleon. I
enquired by whom it was sent. He replied, "By Unsondo."—"And who was
he?"—"He was he who came out first at the breaking off of all things
(ekudabukeni kwezinto zonke)."—"Explain what you mean by
ekudabukeni."—"When this earth and all things broke off from
Uthlanga."—"What is Uthlanga?"—"He who begat (zala) Unsondo."—"You do
not mean then a reed, such as those in that bed of reeds in the
valley?"—"No; but Uthlanga who begat Unsondo."—"Where is he now?"

>  "O, he exists no longer. As my grandfather no longer exists, he too
> no longer exists; he died. <span id="page_16">p. 16</span> When he
> died, there arose others, Unsondo who were called by other names.
> Uthlanga begat Unsondo; Unsondo begat the ancestors; the ancestors
> begat the great grandfathers; the great grandfathers begat the
> grandfathers; and the grandfathers begat our fathers; and our fathers
> begat us."<span id="page_16_fr_32"></span>[32](#page_16_note_32)

 "Are there any who are called Uthlanga now?"—"Yes."—"Are you
married?"—"Yes."—"And have children?"—"Yebo. U mina e ngi uthlanga."
(Yes. It is I myself who am an uthlanga.)—"Because you have become the
father of children?"—"Yes; I am an uthlanga on that account." As he said
this he tapped himself on his breast.

U<span class="small">MFEZI</span>, a native living in the neighbourhood,
called on me. I had never spoken to him on the subject of Unkulunkulu; I
availed myself of the opportunity for gaining information. It was very
difficult to write anything *seriatim*; I was therefore obliged to
content myself by writing what I could, and remembering what I could.

 He said, "'Unkulunkulu wa vela emhlangeni." Unkulunkulu sprang from a
bed of reeds.

 But he did not know where the bed of reeds was. But, "Wa vel’ enzansi,"
that is, by the sea; that is, the bed of reeds from which he sprang was
by the sea-side. He also said, "Kwa dabuka abantu, <span id="page_34">p.
34</span> be datshulwa Unkulunkulu." Men broke off, being broken off by
Unkulunkulu. He added,

>  Some men say that they were belched up by a cow.<span
> id="page_34_fr_65"></span>[65](#page_34_note_65) Others that they
> sprang from a stone<span
> id="page_34_fr_66"></span>[66](#page_34_note_66) which split in two
> and they came out. Unkulunkulu split them out of a stone.

 When asked if they prayed to Unkulunkulu, he replied,

>  There are none who pray to Unkulunkulu. They pray to their own people
> only.

 I enquired what they said about thunder; he said,

>  We say, "O Lord, what have we destroyed? What sin have we done? We
> have done no sin."

 He also related the following legend of the manner in which Amabele
(native corn) was introduced as an article of food:—

 The first woman that Unkulunkulu produced had a child before any of the
rest. There was another woman who was jealous when she saw her with a
child, and hated her and wished to poison her. She looked about her to
find some plant possessed of poisonous properties; she saw the Amabele,
which at that time was not cultivated, but grew like the grass. She
plucked the seeds, and gave them to the woman. She watched, expecting to
see her die; but she did not die, as she had hoped, but grew plump, and
better-looking than ever. At length she asked her if the Amabele was
nice. She replied, "Nice indeed!" And from that time the women
cultivated Amabele, and it became an article of food.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

T<span class="small">HE</span> next legend gives an account of the mode
in which men first became acquainted with food, and of two female
Onkulunkulu; the two following give—the first an account of the origin
of medicines, and the second of two male Onkulunkulu.

>  And those women gave birth to <span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

T<span class="small">WO</span> natives, perfect strangers to me both,
came up as I was asking Umpengula some questions on the subject of the
previous statements. They overheard what I was saying, and asked, "Are
you talking about the origin of men?" I replied that was the subject of
our conversation, and asked if they could tell us any thing about it.
The elder of them replied, "Ba vela emhlangeni," They sprang from a bed
of reeds.

 I asked what he knew of Unkulunkulu; he replied,

> <span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

> id="page_40_fr_75"></span>[75](#page_40_note_75) him from a bed of

not know; and added,

>  Unkulunkulu told men saying, "I too sprang from a bed of reeds."<span

 I asked how men were produced, and got for a reply only a repetition of
the statement that they sprang from a bed of reeds.—I asked if he had
heard anything of a woman; he replied,

U<span class="small">KOTO</span>, a very old Izulu, one of the
Isilangeni tribe, whose father's sister, Unandi, was the mother of
Utshaka, gave me the following accounts:—

> I S<span class="small">AY</span> for my part that the Unkulunkulu whom
> we know is he who was the father of Utshaka; Usenzangakona was
> Utshaka's father. After Usenzangakona comes Utshaka. Utshaka had no

> and Udingane, having no children.

>  Ujama was the father of Usenzangakona, the father of the Utshakas; it
> is he who is Unkulunkulu.<span

> Undaba,<span id="page_49_fr_92"></span>[92](#page_49_note_92) the son
> of Ukubayeni. They Ujama. were the ancestors of Ujama.

 As it was quite clear that he understood my question on the subject of
Unkulunkulu to have reference to the names of the immediate ancestors of
the Amazulu, I asked him if he knew anything about the first man. He
replied:—

>  It was said that two people came out of a reed.<span
> id="page_49_fr_93"></span>[93](#page_49_note_93) There came out a man
> and a woman. At their word<span

> those works which we see, both those of cattle and of food,—all the
> food which we eat.

> <span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

 He said he did not know their names.—I asked what the natives said of a
Creator. He answered:—

>  When we were children it was said, "The Lord is in heaven." We used
> constantly to hear this when we were children; they used to point to
> the Lord on high; we did not hear his name; we heard only that the

I<span class="small">N</span> the neighbourhood there is a very old
woman, with whom I had some casual conversation which appeared to be
calculated to throw some light on their traditions; I therefore sent
Umpengula to obtain from her a connected statement. On his return he
related the substance of her remarks as follows:—

> T<span class="small">HE</span> mother of Ubapa says:—At first, that
> is, when Utshaka was a man and was entering into the kingdom; we girls
> were beginning to marry at that time; I used continually to hear it
> said that the corn which we eat sprang from a bed of reeds; there was
> a bed of reeds; when it was ripe it was red. And people saw constantly
> a beautiful thing in the bed of reeds. At length they said, "Just let

> and said, "O, forsooth, it is good, it is food." So it was taken
> home<span id="page_52_fr_99"></span>[99](#page_52_note_99) and
> cultivated.
>
>  When we spoke of the origin of corn, asking, "Whence came this?" the
> old people said, "It came from the creator who created all things. But
> we do not know him." When we asked continually, <span id="page_53">p.

> id="page_53_fr_100"></span>[100](#page_53_note_100) the old men
> denied, saying, "And those chiefs too whom we see, they were created
> by the creator."
>
>  And when we asked, "Where is he? for he is not visible at all. Where
> is he then?" we heard our fathers pointing towards heaven and saying,
> "The Creator of all things is in heaven. And there is a nation of
> people there too." But we could not well understand when that Creator
> would be visible. It used to be said constantly, "He is the chief of
> chiefs."<span id="page_53_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_53_note_1)
>
>  Also when we heard it said that the heaven had eaten<span
> id="page_53_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_53_note_2) the cattle at such a
> village, we said, "The Lord has taken the cattle from such a village."
> And when it thundered the people took courage by saying, "The Lord is
> playing." That was the state of the matter till we grew up.
>
>  But as for Unkulunkulu, Ubapa's mother did not mention him of her own
> accord. But I tried to direct her attention to him, that she might
> speak of him of her <span id="page_54">p. 54</span> own accord.<span

> id="page_55_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_55_note_4) he went up to heaven

U<span class="small">BEBE</span>, who related the following, was a very
old man, belonging to the Amantanja tribe. He had seen much. His people
were scattered by the armies of Utshaka, and he showed four wounds,
received at different times:—

> And they used to say, "There is a lord in heaven." When it hailed, and

 Having requested Umpengula to ascertain from Ubebe the meaning of
Umdabuko more exactly, be made the following report:—

> I <span class="small">HAVE</span> done as you directed, Teacher, and
> asked of Ubebe what <span id="page_61">p. 61</span> men meant by the

> id="page_61_fr_16"></span>[16](#page_61_note_16) from which men
> sprang; and because they sprang from that, we say, 'The Umdabuko of

>
> ------------------------------------------------------------------------

I <span class="small">REQUESTED</span> Umpengula to enquire of Unjan, of
the Abambo tribe, a petty chief, who came to the village, what he knew
about Unkulunkulu. He reported the following:—

> W<span class="small">HEN</span> I asked him, saying, "Unjan, what do
> you say about that Unkulunkulu, of whom we black men used to talk?" he
> replied, "Him who, we said, made all things?"<span
> id="page_61_fr_18"></span>[18](#page_61_note_18) I replied, "Yes. I
> enquire <span id="page_62">p. 62</span> that I might know what has
> always been the truth about him." He said, "Yes, yes! Do you not
> understand that we said Unkulunkulu made all things that we see or
> touch?" I said, "Yes! Just go on. I am listening for the conclusion."
> And he said, "Although it was said he made all things, yet for my part
> I see that it was said,<span
> id="page_62_fr_19"></span>[19](#page_62_note_19) he was an old man of
> ours, a man like us; for we did not point to any place where he was,
> but said he was a man who came into being first of all other men, who
> was older than all of us, Umvelinqangi. So then I see that by our word
> we said Unkulunkulu made all things, but we know not whence he
> sprang." I asked, "Where is he now?" He said, "O, he is dead." I
> asked, "Where is he gone?" He replied, "We too used to ask, and it was
> answered, 'he is dead.' But by that it is evident that all things were
> not made by a man, who is now dead; they were made by one who now
> is."<span id="page_62_fr_20"></span>[20](#page_62_note_20)
>
>  And when I enquired, saying, "Do not your teachers<span
> id="page_62_fr_21"></span>[21](#page_62_note_21) tell you that the
> lord which is in heaven is Unkulunkulu?" he replied with a <span
> id="page_63">p. 63</span> start, "Hau! by no means. I never heard such
> a word, neither did I ever hear them even mention the name. It is your
> teacher<span id="page_63_fr_22"></span>[22](#page_63_note_22) alone
> with whom I have ever spoken about it."

 The next day I asked him myself, when he made the following statement:—

>  The ancients said that it was Unkulunkulu who gave origin to men, and
> every thing besides, both cattle and wild animals. They said it was an
> ancient man who gave origin to these things, of whom it is now said
> that ancient man is lord; it is said, he is the Lord which is

> now heard from you that the Lord which is in heaven is he who made

> things.

> U<span class="small">LANGENI</span>, an old Ikxosa, but one living at

>
>  And Ulangeni answered, "No; the word Utikxo is not a word we learnt

>
>  Then I asked, "Since you merely used the word Utikxo, what did you

> id="page_65_fr_25"></span>[25](#page_65_note_25)

>  This, then, is what I heard of Ulangeni. So I enquired further, "Have

T<span class="small">HE</span> following account was obtained many years
ago. It was in fact among some of the very first papers written at the
dictation of natives. The native who gave it was an Izulu, who had just
come as a refugee from Zululand. I laid it aside as useless because the
first answers the man gave were absolutely contradictory to those I have
recorded, which he gave when I began to write. But there is reason to
think from statements made by other natives, which have been given
above, that he was really speaking of two Onkulunkulu,—the first man, of
whom he correctly affirmed that no one prayed to him, worshipped him, or
offered him any honour, but to whom he refers the origin, at least the
ordering, of things and customs; and of the Unkulunkulu of the Zulu
nation, or of his own tribe, of whom he correctly affirmed afterwards
that the Amazulu pray to and worship him:—

H<span class="small">AVING</span> had some conversation with Mr. Thomas
Hancock on the meaning of Uukulunkulu, be summoned several old Amabakca
living near him on the Umzimkulu; and we enquired the names of the
fathers of generatious, beginning from the present, and going backward.
They gave the following:—

|                           |                                                                   |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Ubaba                    |  My father                                                        |
|  Ubaba-mkulu              |  My grandfather                                                   |
|  Ubaba-mkulu kababa-mkulu |  My great-grandfather \[lit., the grandfather of my grandfather\] |
|  Ukoko                    |  My great-great-grandfather                                       |
|  Ukulu                    |  My great-great-great-grandfather                                 |

 They did not go further back, but were inclined to give the names of
those who preceded. They said nothing about Unkulunkulu, until we
mentioned the word, and asked who he was. They then threw their heads
backward and said, "He was a long, long time ago, and begat many
people."

 Shortly after, Mr. Hancock sent one Usithlanu, an old Izulu, one of
Utshaka's soldiers, with a note, in which he says:—"Since you were here
I have questioned the bearer about Unkulunkulu, as also others. But
unless I first give them the idea, they know very little or nothing
about it but the name, and that he is one that has begotten a great
number of children. He may be the fiftieth grandfather, or the
five-hundreth."

 I proceeded to enquire of Usithlanu by the aid of a native, directing
him in the first place to ask Usithlanu to go backwards and tell me what
the Amazulu call the fathers of generations, beginning with his own
father. He answered:—

>  The father of my father is ubaba-mkulu; his father is ukoko; the
> father of ukoko is unkulunkulwana;<span
> id="page_86_fr_51"></span>[51](#page_86_note_51) the father of
> unkulunkulwana is unkulunkulu.
>
> <span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

 Here he stopped; but when I requested him to go on still reckoning
backwards, he added:—

>  The father of unkulunkulu is an anterior unkulunkulu; and the father
> of that anterior unkulunkulu a still anterior unkulunkulu, Udhlamini,
> Uthlomo, Uhhadebe, Ungwana, Umashwabade.

 Beyond these he could not remember, but added, the five names here
given are those by which they call their houses, that is, families,
viz., their izibongo or surnames.

 I then requested him to give me his own name, and the names of his
father, grandfather, &c., as far back as he could remember, which he did
as follows:—

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

|              |                         |
|--------------|-------------------------|
|  Usihlanu    |                         |
|  Umantanda   |  Ubaba                  |
|  Usigwakqa   |  Ubaba-mkulu            |
|  Umlotsha    |  Ukoko                  |
|  Umsele      |  Unkulunkulwana         |
|  Ulinda      |  Unkulunkulu            |
|  Uvumandaba  |  Unkulunkulu o ngembili |
|  Udhlamini   | ditto                   |
|  Uhlomo      | ditto                   |
|  Uhhadebe    | ditto                   |
|  Ungwana     | ditto                   |
|  Umashwabade | ditto                   |

>  The surnames of all of them are Udhlamini, Uhhadebe, and
> Umtimkulu.<span id="page_88_fr_53"></span>[53](#page_88_note_53)

 Upon further enquiry it appeared that he did not mean that all the
Onkulunkulu here mentioned were the heads of generations in regular
retrogression, but that the last six were contemporary, and descended
from one father. I asked him to go still further back, but he was
unable; and added:—

>  We end with Umtimkulu and Ungwana and Umashwabade and Uthlomo,
> because they were the chiefs who divided the nations.

 As he did not of his own accord go back to the first unkulunkulu, I
asked him to tell me what, when he was a boy, he was told about the
origin of man. He said:—

>  They told us that we came out of the water, from a bed of reeds, by
> the sea. We heard it said, "There appeared the first man, who came out
> of a reed. He <span id="page_89">p. 89</span> pointed to the growing
> corn and said, "Pluck. That is corn." This was said by the most
> ancient Unkulunkulu, Ukqili.<span
> id="page_89_fr_56"></span>[56](#page_89_note_56) For Ukqili was the
> first Unkulunkulu who came out of the bed of reeds, and begat men.
>
>  The first man is called Unkulunkulu. He came out with a wife; and
> other men came out of the bed of reeds after him, all the primitive
> men. He the first was chief indeed, he who begat men. We say, "They
> were begotten by him who came out first."
>
>  We do not know that the primitive men were begotten. They came, as
> they were, out of the bed <span id="page_90">p. 90</span> of
> reeds;<span id="page_90_fr_57"></span>[57](#page_90_note_57) and
> Unkulunkulu came out as he was. We do not see him, and hear only of
> Uthlanga.<span id="page_90_fr_58"></span>[58](#page_90_note_58) So we
> say he was first; he made<span
> id="page_90_fr_59"></span>[59](#page_90_note_59) the earth, and the
> mountains, the water, corn, food, cattle, and every thing. All things
> came out of the water, dogs and cattle. We say they were made by him,
> for when we came into being they were already all in existence.
>
>  Unkulunkulu came out of Uthlanga with a wife; she, as well as he, is
> called Unkulunkulu.

 I asked him to trace back the female heads of generation, as he had
already the male heads. He said:—

>  She who gave birth to me is umame.
>
>  She who gave birth to umame is umakulu or ukulu.
>
>  She who gave birth to umakulu is my ukoko.
>
>  She who gave birth to my ukoko is ukulukulu.
>
>  She who gave birth to ukulukulu is unkulunkulu.
>
> <span id="page_91">p. 91</span>
>
>  Whether it is man or woman we say unkulunkulu, both of the female and
> of the male.

 Thus, according to this native, the male and female heads of the fifth
generation backwards are called Unkulunkulu. Thus:—

> |                                   |                                                                  |
> |-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
> | M<span class="small">ALE</span>:— | F<span class="small">EMALE</span>:—                              |
> |  Ubaba                            |  Umame                                                           |
> |  Ubaba-mkulu                      |  Umakulu, or Ukulu                                               |
> |  Ukoko                            |  Ukoko                                                           |
> |  Unkulunkulwana                   |  Ukulukulu<span id="page_91_fr_60"></span>[60](#page_91_note_60) |
> |  Unkulunkulu                      |  Unkulunkulu                                                     |

 I said to him, "Where now is the first unkulunkulu?" He replied:—

>  All we know is this, the young and the old die,<span
> id="page_91_fr_61"></span>[61](#page_91_note_61) and the shade<span
> id="page_91_fr_62"></span>[62](#page_91_note_62) departs. The

> Umutimkulu! Uthlomo! Let me obtain <span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

> people see him at night in their dreams.

 I asked him if, when he was a boy in Zululand, the people ever said any
thing about a heavenly lord. He replied:—

>  I, Usithlanu, for my part say there used to be something said about a
> heavenly lord, I mean as regards rain, and our prayers when we asked
> for rain. That did not begin even with Utshaka; even the primitive men

> id="page_92_fr_65"></span>[65](#page_92_note_65) oxen, and sheep and
> black rams; and went to pray; he sang a song and prayed to the lord of

 During the conversation he remarked:—

>  You white men remained behind with our great Itongo.<span

 I asked what he meant by "Itongo" here. Umpengula answered:—

 He also related the following curious tradition:—

U<span class="small">GOFANA</span> and Umyeni, two Amakuza, came to see
me. I asked them to give me the names of the heads of generations on the
female side. They agreed in the main, but Umyeni made Unkulunkulu the
head of the fifth generation backwards, and Ugotana of the fourth;
Umyeni inserting Ukulukulu as the fourth, like Usithlanu (see [p.
91](#page_91)). I then asked them to give me the heads on the male side,
in like manner. The result was as under:—

|                 |              |
|-----------------|--------------|
|  Ubaba          |  Umame       |
|  Ubaba-mkulu    |  Ukulu       |
|  Ukoko          |  Ukoko       |
|  Unkulunkulwana |  Ukulukulu   |
|  Unkulunkulu    |  Unkulunkulu |

 I asked Ugofana what they said about the Unkulunkulu of all men. He
said they knew nothing about him. They said he came out of a reed. He
could not tell me any thing about that Unkulunkulu, nor any body else,
for no one knew. All he could tell me was about his own Unkulunkulu, for
said he, pointing to two others, "He has his; and he his; and I mine."

>  Umdanga who first broke off, begat Umsondo; Umsondo begat Uthlanguza;
> Uthlanguza begat Ujamo, who begat me.
>
> <span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

 I asked them what they meant by "Owa dabuka," Who first broke off.
Umyeni replied, "Kuyise," From his father. And Ugofana, after a moment's
thought, gave his name, "Kudhladhla," From Udhladhla, the great ancestor
of their house, who has given them their surname.

> ------------------------------------------------------------------------

T<span class="small">WO</span> Amabakca, an old and young man, gave me
the heads of generations as given above, [p. 86](#page_86).

 "But," I said, "is there not another word, Ukulukulu or Unkulunkulu?"

 They said, "He is further back (ngembili);" and went on to say that all
who were heads of generations anterior to the okoko were called
Ukulukulu, till they came to Umsondwo,<span
id="page_97_fr_70"></span>[70](#page_97_note_70)

> who came out first; he is the uthlanga of men; he is that uthlanga who

> id="page_97_fr_71"></span>[71](#page_97_note_71)

 I asked them what they said about the Okulukulu. They replied:—

>  They who are anterior to the okoko are the okulukulu of the okoko in
> continuous retrogression, till they reach Umsondwo, who first
> appeared, the umdali of the earth.
>
> <span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

 I asked what they meant by Uthlanga. They answered:—

>  Uthlanga is an old man who made all things, both cattle and and all

> ------------------------------------------------------------------------

U<span class="small">MDUMO</span>, an old man, one of Ukukulela's
people, an Ikuza, being unwilling or unable to give me any account of
the traditions of the people, I asked him to give me the names of the
heads of generations backwards. He gave them thus:—

>  He who begat me is Upotshiyana, my father; he who begat Upotshiyana
> is Umzabani, my grandfather; he who begat Umzabani is Uthlomo, the
> father of my grandfather; he who begat Uthlomo is Unsele, my ukoko; he
> who begat Unsele is Usivunga, the ukoko of my grandfather; he who
> begat Usivunga is Ulusibalukulu. Ulusibalukulu was begotten by
> Udhlamini, the ukulukulu who broke off the nations. When he came he
> broke off Ubithla, the chief; and afterwards Ukukulela and Umaghaga.

 I asked him if there was not an Unkulunkulu. He replied, "Unkulunkulu
and Ukulukulu is one."

 I again asked him who was the first man. He answered:—

>  Udhlamini is he who broke off first; he begat Ulusibalukulu, who
> begat Usivunga.

 I again asked him still more pointedly, refening to their tradition of
the origin of man. He replied:—

> <span id="page_99">p. 99</span>
>
>  Udhlamini is the name of the whom we call Ukulukulu.<span
> id="page_99_fr_72"></span>[72](#page_99_note_72)

 I asked, "Wa dabuka pi?" Where did he break off? He said:

>  It is said that Udhlamini broke off from the mountain Ingome, the
> place of the origin<span
> id="page_99_fr_73"></span>[73](#page_99_note_73) of our tribe.

 I asked him what were the nations he broke off (izizwe owa zi dabula).
He mentioned several, but I did not succeed in writing the names; but
among them were those of which Ukukulela, Uisidoi, and Ufodo are chiefs.
The isibongo or surname of these chiefs is Udhlamini, he being their
common ancestor.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I <span class="small">OVERHEARD</span> Uthlangabeza, one of Ukukulela's
people, talking with some of the men of the village. He said Unkulunkulu
and Ukulukulu is one; and Umvelinqangi and Unkulunkulu is one; that all
things came out of a mountain in the north; and that Uthlabati<span
id="page_99_fr_74"></span>[74](#page_99_note_74) is the name of that
Unkulunkulu owa dabuka eluhlangeni,—who broke off from Uthlanga.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_1">p. 1</span>

 <span id="page_1_note_1"></span>[1](#page_1_fr_1) *A s’ aziwa = ka s’
aziwa*, is no longer known, that is, to us; or as it is said in other
accounts, "A si sa m azi," We no longer know him. There no longer exists
amongst us any knowledge about him. The same expression is used when
speaking of the man from whom the *isibongo* (surname) of a house or
tribe is derived, *ka s’ aziwa*. He is lost to memory, nothing is known
of him or his deeds.

 <span id="page_1_note_2"></span>[2](#page_1_fr_2) This is the constant
statement in the traditions of Unkulunkulu. It has been said that by
*umuntu* we are to understand simply a *person*. But *umuntu* means a
*human being*. And it is more in accordance with the religious system of
the natives to give it that meaning here. They are ancestor-worshippers,
and believe that their first ancestor—the first man—was the creator.
Unkulunkulu means the old-old-one, the most ancient man. In like manner
Arjuna addresses Krishna as, "Thou first of the gods, the most ancient
person." (*Hardwick. Christ and other Masters. Vol. I., p.* 242.) And
the king Satravata addresses "Hari, the preserver of the universe,"
thus, "O first male; the lord of creation, of preservation, of
destruction!" (*Id., p.* 314.)

 <span id="page_1_note_3"></span>[3](#page_1_fr_3) *Dabuka*, to
separate, or to spring or break off, from something by fissure or
division. Thus the swarming of bees is an *ukudabuka*. The division of
small tribes from larger ones—as the small tribes of <span
id="footnotes_page_2">p. 2</span> Umahhaule and Unjan from the Abambo,
the large tribe of Usingela; or as the Americans from the English—is
spoken of as an *ukudabuka*. So if a village has become large, and the
eldest son leaves the paternal kraal, and commences a new centre, that
too is an *ukudabuka*. So the different kind of cattle, English, Dutch,
and Zulu, are said respectively to have sprung from (*dabuka*) the
English, Dutch, or Zulu. It is also said of trees. So of the Reformation
it would be said that the Reformed Churches sprang from (*dabuka*) that
of Rome; and Dissenting Churches from that of England. Or what is
perhaps more to the point, the mode in which Minerva was produced from
Jupiter's head was an *ukudabuka*. As we shall see below, according to
the Hindu mythology, primitive man was produced by a division
(*ukudabuka*) of the substance of Brahma. The use of the word
necessarily implies the pre-existence of something from which the
division took place. When it is said therefore that Unkulunkulu broke
off in the beginning, we must understand either that he broke off from
an eternal or at least pre-existent spiritual being, or from an eternal
or at least pre-existent material being. When it is said, *wa dabuka
eluhlangeni* (he broke off from uthlanga), we may have the intimation of
an eternal spiritual being, a belief in whom formed a part of the creed
of the ancestors of the Amazulu; and when it is said, *wa dabuka
emhlabeni* (he broke off from the earth), it cannot be doubted that we
are to understand it as intimating a belief in the eternity—at least in
the pre-existence—of the world.

 <span id="page_2_note_4"></span>[4](#page_2_fr_4) *Ekukqaleni*. In the
beginning. There is the same obscurity in the Zulu use of this phrase as
in our own. We must understand it here as meaning, *in the beginning of
the present order of things*, and not, from all eternity.

 <span id="page_2_note_5"></span>[5](#page_2_fr_5) But, as it will be
presently seen, a first woman is by many associated with the first man,
that is, Unkulunkulu is said to have had a wife.

 <span id="page_2_note_6"></span>[6](#page_2_fr_6) *Dabula*.—My native
interpreter maintains that although above it is said that Unkulunkulu is
not known to have had a wife, yet that this phrase implies it. But this
is scarcely borne out by the fact that in other accounts he is said to
break off cattle, &c., from Uthlanga. It seems rather that we are to
understand that at first Unkulunkulu broke off, and having broken off,
became the means of breaking off all other things.

 <span id="page_2_note_7"></span>[7](#page_2_fr_7)
*Ohlangeni*.—*Uthlanga* is a reed, strictly speaking, one which is
capable of "stooling," throwing out offsets. It thus comes,
metaphorically, <span id="footnotes_page_3">p. 3</span> to mean a source
of being. A father is the *uthlanga* of his children, from which they
broke off. Whatever notions the ignorant of the present day among the
natives may have of the meaning of this tradition, it may be concluded
that originally it was not intended to teach by it, that men sprang from
a reed. It cannot be doubted that the word alone has come down to the
people, whilst the meaning has been lost. Comp. M. Casalis' account of
the religious notions of the Basutos, p. 240.

 <span id="page_3_note_8"></span>[8](#page_3_fr_8) Hence their saying,
"Ukuhambisa kwonwaba," To go like a chameleon, i. e., to go slowly. They
say also *ukunwabuzela*.

 <span id="page_3_note_9"></span>[9](#page_3_fr_9) *Ubukwebezane*.—A
shrub which bears clusters of berries of a purplish colour and sweet
taste. This fruit is much liked by children.

 <span id="page_3_note_10"></span>[10](#page_3_fr_10) *Intulo* =
*intulwa*, the Amalala *inulwa*. The tradition lives among the natives
to the present time, and is manifested by the dislike they entertain for
the chameleon. It is frequently killed. But it is used as a medicine;
among other uses it is mixed with other things to doctor their gardens,
that the birds may not destroy the corn; it is employed because it went
slowly, and therefore will prevent the birds <span
id="footnotes_page_4">p. 4</span> from hastily entering the gardens! But
the lizard is an object of much greater hatred, and is invariably killed
if the person who sees it is able to kill it; but it is very cunning,
and, as they say, "escapes only by its cunning." As they kill it they
say, "Yiya! i sona lesi ’silimane esa gijima kukqala sa ya ’kuti,
'Abantu a ba fe.'" Let be! This is the very piece of deformity which ran
in the beginning to say that men should die.

<span id="footnotes_page_4">p. 4</span>

 <span id="page_4_note_11"></span>[11](#page_4_fr_11) This tradition of
the origin of death has a strong resemblance to the Hottentot account.
But there it is the Moon—a Hottentot god, according to Kolb, (*The
Present State of the Cape of Good Hope*, (*Medley*,) *Volume I., page*
95)—which sends an insect to man with the message:—"Go thou to men, and
tell them, 'As I die, and dying live, so ye shall also die, and dying
live.'" The insect, meeting with the hare, entrusts the message to him;
but when he reaches man, he says, "I am sent by the Moon to tell you,
'As I die, and dying perish, in the same manner ye shall also die, and
come wholly to an end.'" (*Bleek's Hottentot Fables*, p. 69.)

 This account is, however, a promise of renovation through death.

 The New Zealand legend again may be compared, where we meet with
another a foreshadowing of redemption through One destroying death by
passing through it, than an account of the cause of death entering into
the world. Maui is made liable to death by some accidental omission of a
part of the baptismal ritual,—a cause as trivial as the delay of the
chameleon, or the false message of the hare.

 Maui was an abortion; he was born as his mother was passing along by
the sea-shore. She cut off the long tresses of her hair, and bound him
up in them, and threw him into the foam of the sea, and after that he
was found by his ancestor Tama-nui-ki-te-Rangi, and by his care
developed into a man. As yet there was no death. But Maui's father,
"from mistake, hurriedly skipped over part of the prayers of the
baptismal service, and of the services to purify Maui; he knew that the
gods would be certain to punish this fault, by causing Maui to die, and
his alarm and anxiety were therefore great." Maui having transformed by
enchantments Irawaru, his sister Hinauri's husband, into a dog, and
Hinauri having girded herself with an enchanted girdle had cast herself
into the sea, and been swept away by the tide, he was obliged to quit
the village where Irawaru had lived, <span id="footnotes_page_5">p.
5</span> and so returned to his parents. His father said, "Oh my son, I
have heard from your mother and others that you are very valiant, and
that you have succeeded in all feats that you have undertaken in your
own country, whether they are small or great; but now that you have
arrived in your father's country, you will perhaps at last be overcome."
On asking "what he could be vanquished by?" his father replied, "By your
great ancestress Hine-nui-te-po." But he answered, "Lay aside such idle
thoughts, and let us both fearlessly seek whether men are to die or live
for ever." Maui pleads that he had subdued Tama-nui-te-Ra (the sun), and
had rescued much land by drawing it up from the sea. His father admits
the truth, and bids him go boldly to visit "his great ancestress," who,
he knew, would be the cause of his death. Maui set out on his journey,
taking "every kind of little bird" as his companions. Maui and his
companions found Hine-nui-te-po asleep. Maui told them that he was about
to creep into the old chieftainess, and warned them not to laugh until
they saw him "just coming out of her mouth; then they might shout with
laughter if they pleased." When he entered the old chieftainess, "the
little birds screwed up their tiny cheeks, trying to suppress laughter;
at last, the little Tiwa-kawaka laughed out loud with its merry cheerful
note," and the old woman awoke, and killed Maui. This was the cause of
the introduction of death into the world. Hine-nui-te-po being the
goddess of death, had Maui passed safely through her, then no more human
beings would have died, but death itself would have been destroyed.
(*Grey. Polynesian Mythology, p.* 16-58.)

 <span id="page_5_note_12"></span>[12](#page_5_fr_12) *Itongo*, p.
*Amatongo*.—An *itongo* is properly the spirit of the dead,—a
disembodied spirit. The notion that it is in the form of a snake, or
becomes converted into a snake, is probably something superadded to the
original tradition. But all these questions will be discussed when we
come to the "A<span class="small">MATONGO</span>."

 <span id="page_5_note_13"></span>[13](#page_5_fr_13) *Ukwelapa itongo*,
lit., to treat an itongo, that is, diseases which are occasioned by the
itongo, as *uthlabo*, which appears from the description to be
pleurodynia; one case I was called to see was pleurisy.

<span id="footnotes_page_7">p. 7</span>

 <span id="page_7_note_15"></span>[15](#page_7_fr_15) *Umvelinqangi*,
the first out-comer.

 <span id="page_7_note_16"></span>[16](#page_7_fr_16) Let the reader
note that here three names are applied to the first man, Unkulunkulu,
Umvelinqangi, and Uthlanga. *Unkulunkulu* expresses antiquity, age,
lit., the old-old one, as we use great in great-great-grandfather.
*Umvelinqangi* expresses priority; the first out-comer. *Uthlanga*,
potential source of being. Neither must this be regarded as a
contradiction to the statement lower down, "Wa vela lapa abantu ba
dabuka kona ohlangeni," He came out where men broke off from Uthlanga.
For Unkulunkulu, the first man, sprang from—came out of—broke off from—a
previously existing uthlanga or source of being, the nature of which is
quite beyond the native philosophy; and having come out, he became the
uthlanga or source of being of entire humanity.

 <span id="page_7_note_17"></span>[17](#page_7_fr_17) *U kona*, is. We
must not, however, understand this as a declaration of the ancients that
Unkulunkulu has a present existence. But they mean to say, "Unkulunkulu
was a *reality*; that which we say of him is not a fable, but a fact.
Unkulunkulu is a reality; he made us, and is, as it were, in us his
work. We exist because he existed." That this is the meaning we gather
not only from the interpretation of it by natives, and from other
accounts of the same tradition, but from the statement made below, "B’
ezwa ngokutshiwo ukuti Unkulunkulu wa be kona," They heard it said that
Unkulunkulu was, or used to be; the tense necessarily implying that he
exists no longer.

 <span id="page_7_note_18"></span>[18](#page_7_fr_18) *Abadala bendulo*,
the ancients of long ago,—not merely ancients, but the ancients of
primitive times; those who formed the first races of mankind.

 <span id="page_7_note_19"></span>[19](#page_7_fr_19) The natives
profess to be unable to give any account of the origin of things; but
refer to a period when the ancients understood the history of creation.

 <span id="page_8_note_20"></span>[20](#page_8_fr_20) A large, green,

 <span id="page_9_note_21"></span>[21](#page_9_fr_21) This account was
given by a refugee recently arrived from Zululand, whose name I do not
know.

 <span id="page_9_note_22"></span>[22](#page_9_fr_22) *Umhlanga* is a
bed of reeds. We must not confound *umhlanga* with *uhlanga*. *Umhlanga*
is the place where they broke off—or out-came—from *Uhlanga*.

 <span id="page_9_note_23"></span>[23](#page_9_fr_23) *Vela*, had our
origin,—*out-came*, equivalent to "were created." It does not mean
merely appearing.

<span id="footnotes_page_10">p. 10</span>

 <span id="page_10_note_24"></span>[24](#page_10_fr_24) *Umoya*, spirit.
The native who related this tale, though not a Christian, had lived with
whitemen from his childhood, and for some years with a missionary. The
untaught native would not use *umoya* (wind, air) in the sense of
spirit, as this man uses it. They would apply it to the air we breathe,
but not to the spirit or soul of man. Neither do they use itongo,
idhlozi, isituta (ghost), or isitunzi (shade), of any power animating
the body, but only of something,—a new or distinct existence,—which
comes out of the body when dead.

 <span id="page_10_note_25"></span>[25](#page_10_fr_25) Many
misunderstandings of native traditions have arisen from the enquiry,
"Unkulunkulu ubani na?" meaning who or what is Unkulunkulu. It really
means, "What is his *name*?" The native cannot tell you his *name*,
except it be Umvelinqangi.

 <span id="page_10_note_26"></span>[26](#page_10_fr_26) *Bonga*,
worship. It is necessary to give *bonga* this full meaning here, and not
to restrict it to the offices of praising or thanking. It is equivalent
to *pata*, which is used for all and every kind of adoration and
worship.

<span id="footnotes_page_11">p. 11</span>

 <span id="page_12_note_28"></span>[28](#page_12_fr_28) *Abapansi*, i.
e., the Amatongo, they who are beneath. Some <span
id="footnotes_page_13">p. 13</span> natives say, so called, because they
have been *buried beneath the earth*. But we cannot avoid believing that
we have an intimation of an old faith in a Hades or Tartarus, which has
become lost and is no longer understood. *Subterraneans* is an exact
translation of *abapansi*, and as we proceed we shall find that similar
characteristics and actions are ascribed to the Amatongo as to the
Subterraneans in the mythology of other people.

 <span id="page_13_note_29"></span>[29](#page_13_fr_29) *Abantu
bansondo*, or it is sometimes said, *bakansondo*.

<span id="footnotes_page_14">p. 14</span>

 <span id="page_14_note_30"></span>[30](#page_14_fr_30) *Uthlanga* is
also used to express beauty. "Si tshele ni uhlanga oluhle lapa
lwentombi," Tell us which is the prettiest girl here. They also say,
"Inkosi yohlanga," that is, a chief who refers his descent to Uthlanga,
that is, to him whom they regard as the creator or source of all things.
We may compare this with διογενης βασιλευς of Homer.

 <span id="page_14_note_31"></span>[31](#page_14_fr_31) By this we are
to understand that at his death Unsondo uttered a prophecy of the future
of his children, telling them by what kind of conduct, good and bad,
they would be characterised. Thus it is said not only of a good man, "Wa
muhle! umuntu wansondo!" How good he is! a man of Unsondo! to express
the perfection of goodness, but also of the wicked, "Au! wa mubi! umuntu
wansondo!" O! how wicked he is! a man of Unsondo! to express utter
wickedness. We may compare this with the Hebrew idiom, which without
being identical is remarkably similar; that of designating any thing of
surpassing excellence as God's, e.g. "A very great trembling," lit., a
trembling of God ([1 Sam. xiv. 15](../../bib/kjv/sa1.htm#14:15)); and in
[Gen. xxxv. 5](../../bib/kjv/gen.htm#35:5), "The terror of God (that is,
an exceeding great terror) was upon the cities." (*See Gesenius*.)

wrote at his dictation in my study; the rest from memory.

 <span id="page_16_note_33"></span>[33](#page_16_fr_33) The native thus
begins his statement because I had previously read to him what other
natives had said on the subject.

 <span id="page_16_note_34"></span>[34](#page_16_fr_34) He means by this
that he had heard that Unkulunkulu was the first that existed, and that
existing he made others. But we shall see by and bye that this man is
mistaken. Unkulunkulu is supposed to have a wife.

<span id="footnotes_page_17">p. 17</span>

 <span id="page_17_note_35"></span>[35](#page_17_fr_35) A mistake has no
doubt often arisen on the question of whether Unkulunkulu is worshipped
by the natives or not, from the failure to recognise the fact that there
are many Onkulunkulu; and the statements of natives have been wrongly
supposed to be contradictory. The Unkulunkulu *par excellence*, the
first man, is no where worshipped. No *isibongo* of his is known. The
worship, therefore, of him according to native worship is no longer
possible. But the Onkulunkulu of tribes and houses, whose *izibongo* are
still known, are worshipped, each by his respective descendents.

 <span id="page_17_note_36"></span>[36](#page_17_fr_36) He means by this
that he is not sure whether in the beginning they worshipped him or not;
but they no longer worship him, but the Amatongo, and thank the Amatongo
for the things which they believe were created by Unkulunkulu.

<span id="footnotes_page_18">p. 18</span>

 <span id="page_18_note_37"></span>[37](#page_18_fr_37) This implies
that he had a son; but the *isibongo* or praise-giving name of
Unkulunkulu is lost; by the process of time and many wanderings, other
names have been taken up, each house having its own *isibongo*.

 <span id="page_18_note_38"></span>[38](#page_18_fr_38) He here uses a
metaphor comparing men, or their houses, to the grains on an ear of
maize; Unkulunkulu is the stalk, which having done its work dies; the
seeds are the men, who sprang from him and became centres of families,
each having its distinct family name or isibongo, and the children of
successive generations worship those who preceded them. But the native
adds as I am making this note, "Lelo ’zwi lokuti izinhlamvu zi bongana
zodwa loko ukuti i leyo ’nhlamvu endhlini yayo se i unkulunkulu
enzalweni yayo, leyo na leyo njalo," As for the saying, Each grain
worships those which belong to itself, it means that each grain in its
own house is an unkulunkulu to its offspring, each to its own offspring
throughout.—Thus although the First Out-comer, Unkulunkulu, is not
worshipped, other Onkulunkulu are worshipped, that is, their names are
known and used in acts of adoration. But we shall see this more clearly
by and bye.

immediate direction of the native who first dictated it to me. What he
means to say is this, that they really know nothing more about
Unkulunkulu than that he made all things, and gave them to mankind;
having made men proper for the things, and the things proper for the
men; but that there is not known to be any connection between the
present state of things and the primitive gift of the creator.

*dabula*, which makes Umthlanga the active agent in the origin of
Unkulunkulu, just as Uthlanga is constantly represented in other forms
of the tradition. But the native teacher thinks it a mistake for
*dubuka*, a repetition of what is said just above.

received that there are many Onkulunkulu, that each house has its own,
and is an object of worship, his name being the chief *isibongo* or
surname, by which the Spirits or Amatongo of his family are addressed.

 <span id="page_34_note_65"></span>[65](#page_34_fr_65) We are not to

among the natives when they see an exquisitely handsome man, or when
they wish to flatter a chief, to say, "Ka zalwanga; wa bohlwa inkomo

go through the ordinary and tedious and painful process of being born,
but came into being already a perfected man.

with the Jewish simile, "Look unto the rock whence ye were hewn," that
is, to Abraham, their father. ([Isaiah li.

nearest rendering we can give to *veziwe*; it is equivalent to
*created*. It is passive, and necessarily implies an agent by which he
had an origin given to him. No native would hear such a phrase as "Naye
e veziwe," He too having had an origin given him, without putting the
question, By whom?

 <span id="page_40_note_76"></span>[76](#page_40_fr_76) Unkulunkulu was
an unbegotten though a created man. He was the first man; by this
statement he is to be understood as deprecating the ascription to
himself of something higher and more exalted. He is, as it were, telling
his children the history of creation as he had witnessed it. They appear
to be desirous of making him the creator; but he replies, "No; I too
sprang from the bed of reeds."

 <span id="page_40_note_77"></span>[77](#page_40_fr_77) This is very
precise. The first man and woman sprang, the man first and then the
woman, from the bed of reeds; and both are called by one name,
Unkulunkulu; that is, Great-great-grandparent. According to Moses, the
male and female were both called Adam. ([Gen. v.
3](../../bib/kjv/gen.htm#5:3).)

<span id="footnotes_page_42">p. 42</span>

 <span id="page_42_note_82"></span>[82](#page_42_fr_82) The account here
given of Uthlanga is peculiar. The native who gave it, clearly
understood by it a reed. Yet one cannot avoid believing that he did not
understand the import of the tradition. It is said that Umvelinqangi
made the reed, and that the reed gave origin to Unkulunkulu and his
wife. It is said also that Umvelinqangi begat them with a reed
(*nohlanga*); and from a reed (*eluhlangeni*). Both these forms are used
of the female in generation. A child is begotten from the woman, or with
her. And it is the belief of the native teacher that the real meaning of
this tradition is that Umvelinqangi made Uthlanga, a female, and with
her became the parent of the human race. Uthlanga, therefore, in this
form of the tradition, has a feminine import; whilst in others it has a
masculine. Yet the same men in speaking of the origin of Umvelinqangi
(pronounced by this tribe Umvelikqangi) said he sprang from
Uthlanga.—There is really no contradiction in such statements. For the
term Uthlanga is applied not only to the Primal Source of Being, but to
any other <span id="footnotes_page_43">p. 43</span> source of being, as
a father, or to a mother, as in the following sentence:—

>  Who is the Uthlanga of such a family? They answer by giving the name
> of the man, who is the head of that house. But he is not the Uthlanga
> by himself; he is the Uthlanga in conjunction with the female; for
> there is not a man who is an Uthlanga by himself, there being no
> female.

 Compare this with the following legends of the Hindus, where Brahma
corresponds with Umvelinqangi; and where there is the same confusion
between Brahma the Creator,—the First Man,—"and the male half of his
individuality." Umvelinqangi is both the Primal Source of Being and the
First Man; he is the creator of the first woman and her husband. And
Satarupa, "the great universal mother," is equivalent to Uthlanga, the
female Unkulunkulu,—the great-great mother of the human race:—

 "According to one view, Brahma, the God of Creation, converted himself
into two persons, the first man, or the Manu Swayambhuva, and the first
woman, or Satarupa: this division into halves expressing, it would seem,
the general distinction of corporeal substance into two sexes, and
Satarupa, as hinted by the etymology of the word itself, denoting the
great universal mother, the one parent of 'a hundred forms.'"
(*Hardwick. Op. cit., Vol. I., p.* 297.)

 "As the old traditions of their ancestors were gradually distorted, the
Hindus appear to have identified the first man (Manu Swayambhuva) with
Brahma himself, of whom, as of the primary cause, he was the brightest
emanation; while Satarupa, the wife and counterpart of Manu, was
similarly converted into the bride of the creative principle itself.
Brahma, in other words, was 'confounded with the male half of his
individuality.'" (*Id., p.* 305.)

 A similar apparent contradiction to that which runs throughout these
Zulu legends is also found in the Myth of Prometheus, who though a
man—the son of Japetus—is said to be the creator of the human race:—

water*.—That is, according to the notion of the narrator, the reed which
Umvelinqangi made and by which he begat the first parents of the human
race, was in the water. It is probably only another way of saying men
sprang from a bed of reeds. But some forms of the tradition represent
tribes at least, if not the human race, as being born in or derived from
the water. See [p. 36](#page_36).

perfectly clear what the natives understand by Unkulunkulu coming out of
the earth. The earth is the mother of Unkulunkulu, the first man, as of
every other creature. Compare Milton:—

 Compare also *Ovid. Met.*, <span class="small">B</span>. I., l.
416-421.—This, too, corresponds with the Scripture account of Creation;
[Gen. i. 20](../../bib/kjv/gen.htm#1:20), 24. It is also philosophically
correct to refer the origin of things secondarily to the earth. The
material organisms of all living things consist of elements derived from
the earth. The poetic imagination, to which time and space impose no
limits, represents as occurring at a point in time what, it may be, took
myriads of years for its production in accordance with laws imposed on
the Universe by the fiat of the Creator.

 <span id="page_48_note_90"></span>[90](#page_48_fr_90) As the question
has been raised whether the natives do not call the First Man, or Being,
Unkulunkulu, and an Ancestor Ukulukulu, in order to prevent all
misunderstanding I asked him if he was not speaking of Ukulukulu. He
replied Ukulukulu and Unkulunkulu is one and the same word; the Amazulu
say Unkulunkulu; other tribes Ukulukulu; but the word is one. I enquired
what he meant by Unkulunkulu; he answered,

>  We have employed the word great \[father\] to designate the father of
> our father; and we call that man great \[father\]. And there was a
> great-great \[father\], to wit, one who was before him.
>
>  We do not speak of power when we say Unkulunkulu, but especially of

> old by once; and if the children of that man has children, they will
> speak by the reduplicated name, and unite their father's name with
> his, and say Unkulunkulu, that is, one who is very old.

 What has been said above, then, together with what is here stated, is
sufficient to settle all doubt on the subject. I shall not therefore
give all the similar statements derived from a great number of different
natives to confirm the fact, that by Unkulunkulu or Ukulukulu they mean
a great-great-grandfather, and hence a very ancient man much further
removed from the present generation than a great-great-grandfather.
Hence it is applied to the founders of dynasties, tribes, and families.
The order is as follows:—

|                        |                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------|
| Ubaba, my father       | Umame, my mother      |
| Ubaba-mkulu, or Ukulu  | Umame-mkulu, or Ukulu |
| Ukoko                  | Ukoko                 |
| Unkulunkulu            | Unkulunkulu           |

 Ukoko is a general term for Ancestor who preceded the grandfathers. And
Unkulunkulu is a general term for Ancient Men, who "were first" among
tribes, families, or kings. See [Appendix](rsa02.htm#note_90).

<span id="footnotes_page_49">p. 49</span>

 <span id="page_49_note_91"></span>[91](#page_49_fr_91) Let us note this
plural of Umvelinqangi; and that the Omvelinqangi are the fathers of the
generation preceding that of the Onkulunkulu; that is, they are the
fathers of the Onkulunkulu; that is, the great-great-great-grandfathers.

 Usobekase, a petty chief over a portion of the Amabele, when speaking
of the origin of things, said they were made by Umvelinqangi; that there
was a first man and a first woman; they were Abavelinqangi, and that men
sprang from them by generation. He did not use the word Unkulunkulu at
all,—Umkqumbela, also, a very old man of the Amangwane, spoke of the
Omvelinqangi in the plural, and used the word as strictly synonymous
with Unkulunkulu, and, like that word, applicable not only to the first
man, but to the founder of families, dynasties, tribes, &c.

 <span id="page_49_note_92"></span>[92](#page_49_fr_92) The origin of
Undaba is thus given by Uncinjana, an Ibele:—

>  Undaba sprang from Upunga, and was the father of Usenzangakona.
> Usenzangakona sprang from Undaba, and was the father of Utshaka.
> Undaba is the Unkulunkulu.

 The attention of the Zulu scholar is directed to the use of *dabuka* in
this statement.

 Whilst travelling lately among a wholly uncultivated tribe, on asking
what they meant by the *ukudabuka* of men from Unkulunkulu, they
replied, "Ba dabuka esiswini sake," They broke off from her bowels; that
is, of the first female Unkulunkulu.

 <span id="page_49_note_93"></span>[93](#page_49_fr_93) Or, from
Uthlanga.

 <span id="page_49_note_94"></span>[94](#page_49_fr_94) In this
remarkable sentence the origin of things is ascribed to the joint word
of the man and woman.

<span id="footnotes_page_50">p. 50</span>

 <span id="page_50_note_95"></span>[95](#page_50_fr_95) This and two or
three other statements are the only instances I have met with of the
word Umdabuko for the source of creation, but its meaning is evident. It
is equivalent to Umdayi of the Amakqwabe, the Umdali of the Amakxosa,
and the Umenzi of the Amazulu.

 *Umdabuko*, however, is derived from *ukudabuka*, to be broken off (see
[Note 3, page 1](#page_1_note_3)), and therefore has a passive
signification, and thus differs from Umenzi and Umdali, which are
active. It more resembles Uthlanga, and though in some places apparently
used for an active creator, would mean rather a passive, though
potential source of being,—passive, that is, as a female, or as a seed,
which have however wrapped up in them potentially the future offspring.

 We may compare with this the legend of the Bechuanas:—

 "Morimo, as well as man, with all the different species of animals,
came out of a hole or cave in the Bakone country, to the north, where,
say they, their footmarks are still to be seen in the indurated rock,
which was at that time sand. In one of Mr. Hamilton's early journals, he
records that a native had informed him that the footmarks of Morimo were
distinguished by being without toes. Once I heard a man of influence
telling his story on the subject. I of course could not say thot I
believed the wondrous tale, but very mildly hinted that he might be
misinformed; on which he became indignant, and swore by his ancestors
and his king, that he had visited the spot, and paid a tax to see the
wonder; and that, consequently, his testimony was indubitable. I very
soon cooled his rage by telling him that as I should likely one day
visit those regions, I should certainly think myself very fortunate if I
could get him as a guide to that wonderful source of animated nature.
Smiling, he said, 'Ha, and I shall show you *the* <span
id="footnotes_page_51">p. 51</span> *footsteps of the very first man*.'
This is the sum-total of the knowledge which the Bechuanas possessed of
the origin of what they call Morimo, prior to the period when they were
visited by missionaries." (*Missionary Labours and Scenes in South
Africa,. Moffat, p.* 262. )

 See also a corresponding legend among the Basutos:—

 "A legend says that both men and animals came out of the bowels of the
earth by an immense hole, the opening of which was in a cavern, and that
the animals appeared first. Another tradition, more generally received
among the Basutos, is, that man sprang up in a marshy place, where reeds
were growing." (*The Basutos. Casalis, p.* 240.)

 <span id="page_51_note_96"></span>[96](#page_51_fr_96) That is, at a
certain period the tribe divided into three, each having its own

 <span id="page_54_note_3"></span>[3](#page_54_fr_3) This is a very
common occurrence. Very old Amazulu, when asked about Unkulunkulu, are
apt to speak, not of the first Unkulunkulu, but the onkulunkulu of their
tribes.

 Mr. Hully, a missionary for some years connected with the Wesleyans,
went up to the Zulu country as interpreter to Mr. Owen, in 1837. He says
the word Unkulunkulu was not then in use among the natives; but that
Captain Gardiner introduced it to express the Greatest, or the Maker of
all men. Mr. Hully refused to use it in this sense. He allowed that the
word *kulu* meant great, but denied that Unkulunkulu existed in the
language to express that which Capt. Gardiner wished. But he persisted
in using it through a young man named Verity.

 The following remarks from Captain Gardiner's work appear to justify
this statement of Mr. Hully:—

 "The conversation which took place I will now relate, as nearly as I
can, in the precise words:—

 "'Have you any knowledge of the power by whom the world was made? When
you see the sun rising and setting, and the trees growing, do you know
who made them and who governs them?'

 "Tpai (after a little pause, apparently deep in thought)—'No; we see
them, but cannot tell how they come: we suppose that they come of
themselves.'

 "'To whom then do you attribute your success or failure in war?'

 "Tpai—' When we are unsuccessful, and do not take cattle, we think that
our father' \[Itongo\] 'has not looked upon us.'

 "'Do you think your father's spirits' \[Amatongo\] 'made the world?'

 "Tpai—'No.'

 "'Where do you suppose the spirit of a man goes after it leaves the
body?'

 "Tpai—'We cannot tell.'

 "'Do you think it lives for ever?'

 "Tpai—'That we cannot tell; we believe that the spirit of our
forefathers looks upon us when we go out to war; but we do not think
about it at any other time.'

 "'You admit that you cannot control the sun or the moon, or even make a
hair of your head to grow. Have you no idea of any power capable of
doing this?'

 "Tpai—'No; we know of none: we know that we cannot do these things, and
we suppose that they come of themselves.'" (*Narrative of a Journey to
the Zoolu Country. Capt. Allen F. Gardiner, R.N.; undertaken in* 1835,
*p*. 283.)

 He thus speaks of a tribe on the Umzimvubu:—

 "On the subject of religion they are equally as dark as their <span
id="footnotes_page_55">p. 55</span> neighbours the Zoolus. They
acknowledged, indeed, a traditionary account of a Supreme Being, whom
they called Oukoolukoolu" \[Ukulukulu\] "(literally the Great-Great),
but knew nothing further respecting him, than that he originally issued
from the reeds, created men and cattle, and taught them the use of the
assagai. They knew not how long the issitoota," \[isituta\] "or spirit
of a deceased person, existed after its departure from the body, but
attributed every untoward occurrence to its influence, slaughtering a
beast to propitiate its favour on every occasion of severe sickness, &c.
As is customary among all these nations, a similar offering is made by
the ruling chief to the spirit of his immediate ancestor preparatory to
any warlike or hunting expedition, and it is to the humour of this
capricious spirit that every degree of failure or success is ascribed."
(*Id., p*. 314.)

 <span id="page_55_note_4"></span>[4](#page_55_fr_4) That is, she
assents to the statement that Unkulunkulu sprang from the earth. But
asserts also that he is the heavenly Lord, of whom she has been
speaking.

 This account is in many respects very remarkable. It is not at all
necessary to conclude that the mind of the old woman was wandering.
There appears to be in the account rather the intermixture of several
faiths, which might have met and contended or amalgamated at the time to
which she alludes:—1. A primitlve faith in a heavenly Lord or Creator.
2. The ancestor-worshipping faith, which confounds <span
id="footnotes_page_56">p. 56</span> the Creator with the First Man. 3.
The Christian faith again directing the attention of the natives to a
God, which is not anthropomorphic.

 But she may intend to refer to the supposed ascent of Usenzangakona,
the father of Utshaka, into heaven, which is recounted in the following
izibongo, that is, flattering declamations by which the praises of the
living or the dead are celebrated:—

>  There were lauds of Usenzangakona, by which he was lauded by his
> people; they said,
>
>  Child of Ujama, who twisted a large rope which reached to heaven,
> where the Spirits of the Amageba will not arrive. They will again and
> again make fruitless efforts, and break their little toes."
>
>  Amageba is an ancient name of the Amazulu. It means the shadows
> caused by the departing sun; they recline on the mountains. Amageba
> are the people of Umageba, the Unkulunkulu of the Amazulu. Umageba
> begat Ujama; he begat Usenzangakona; he begat Utshaka. And as regards
> Umageba, there is his unkulunkulu where we know not.

distinctly Uthlanga is a proper name,—that of the first woman. But the
origin of Uthlanga is not known; it is suggested that she came forth
from Uthlanga together with Unkulunkulu—that is, an anterior
Uthlanga.—Compare this with the legend above given, where it is said
Umvelinqangi made an Uthlanga and begat children by her. See below,
where it is said, "Uhlanga ka se ko;" Uthlanga is dead; not, A *lu* se
ko.

 <span id="page_58_note_10"></span>[10](#page_58_fr_10) This is a mode
of asserting his belief that since the fathers said Unkulunkulu begat
men, he could not do so without a wife, and that therefore Uthlanga was
a woman.

 <span id="page_58_note_11"></span>[11](#page_58_fr_11) *Zala* is to

Source of Being,—local or personal,—the place in which man was created,
or the person who created him. But if a place, it is possessed of a
special potentiality. See [Note 95, p. 50](#page_50_note_95). But here
the Umdabuko is called "the lord which gives them life."

 <span id="page_59_note_13"></span>[13](#page_59_fr_13) The argument is,
since we see that life-giving influences,—the rain and sun,—come from
heaven, we conclude that there too is the original source of life.

 <span id="page_59_note_14"></span>[14](#page_59_fr_14) It is supposed
that black cattle are chosen because when it is about to rain the sky is
overcast with dark clouds. When the ox is killed, its flesh is eaten in
the house, and perfect silence is maintained till the whole is consumed,
in token of humble submission to the lord of heaven, from whom, and not
of the chief, the rain is asked. The bones are burnt outside the
village. After eating the flesh in silence, they sing a song. The songs
sung on such occasions consist merely of musical sounds, and are without
words.

<span id="footnotes_page_60">p. 60</span>

 <span id="page_60_note_15"></span>[15](#page_60_fr_15) Contrast this
with what Arbousset says of the superstition found among the Lighoyas:—

 "When it thunders every one trembles; if there are several together,
one asks the other with uneasiness, 'Is there any one amongst us who
devours the wealth of others?' All then spit on the ground, saying, 'We
do not devour the wealth of others.' If a thunderbolt strikes and kills
one of them, no one complains, none weep; instead of being grieved, all
unite in saying that the Lord is delighted (that is to say, he has done
right), with killing that man; they say also that the thief eats
thunderbolts, that is to say, does things which draw down upon men such
judgments. There can be no doubt, they suppose, that the victim in such
a case must have been guilty of some crime, of stealing most probably, a
vice from which very few of the Bechuanas are exempt, and that it is on
this account that fire from heaven has fallen upon him." (*Exploratory
Tour in South Africa, p.* 323.)

 Casalis says that, among the Basutos, "If any one is struck dead by
lightning, no murmur is heard and tears are suppressed. 'The Lord has
killed him,' they say; 'he is, doubtless, rejoicing: let us be careful
not to disturb his joy.'" (*The Basutos, p.* 242.)

Umdabuko as a female, or referring to that Uthlanga or Source of being
from which Unkulunkulu himself and all things else sprang. But we are
here, no doubt, to understand the latter, for above he states that the
old men believed in an Umdabuko which is above, and which he calls, "the
Lord which gives them life."

this reasoning is the result of a certain amount of light. When once he
had been induced to think, he said that the things around him could not,
as the old men said, have had a mere human author, who came into being
and passed away.

 <span id="page_64_note_24"></span>[24](#page_64_fr_24) Just as among
other people sneezing is associated with some superstitious feeling. In
England and Germany old people will say, "God bless you," when a person
sneezes. Among the Amazulu, if a child sneeze, it is regarded as a good
sign; and if it be ill, they believe it will recover. On such an
occasion they exclaim, "Tutuka," Grow. When a grown up person sneezes,
he says, "Bakiti, ngi hambe kade," Spirits of our people, grant me a
long life. As he believes that at the time of sneezing the Spirit of his
house is in some especial proximity to him, he believes it is a time
especially favourable to prayer, and that whatever he asks for will be
given; hence he may say, "Bakwiti, inkomo," Spirits of our people, give
me cattle; or, "Bakwiti, abantwana," Spirits of our people, give me
children. Diviners among the natives are very apt to sneeze, which they
regard as an indication of the presence of the Spirits; the diviner
adores by saying, "Makosi," Lords, or Masters.

<span id="footnotes_page_65">p. 65</span>

 <span id="page_65_note_25"></span>[25](#page_65_fr_25) It may be worth
noting here that what the Amazulu say of the lord of heaven, for whom
they have no name, the Amakxosa say of Utikxo.

 <span id="page_65_note_26"></span>[26](#page_65_fr_26) This is to be
understood as expressing his utter contempt for the Hottentots, and
unwillingness to admit that the Kafir could learn any thing from them.
It cannot, however, be doubted that he is mistaken in supposing that
they did not derive the word from the Hottentots.

 The isivivane, then, is a heap of stones, the meaning of which the
natives of these parts are unacquainted with. When they pass such a
heap, they spit on a stone and throw it on the heap. Sometimes they
salute it by saying, "Sa ku bona, bantwana bakasivivane," Good day,
children of Usivivane; thus personifying Isivivane, and acting in
correspondence with the Kxosa salutation to Unkulunkulu.—Sir James E.
Alexander relates the following of the Namaquas:—"In the country there
are occasionally found large heaps of stones on which had been thrown a
few bushes; and if the Namaquas are asked what they are, they say that
*Heije Eibib*, their Great Father, is below the heap; they do not know
what he is like, or what he does; they only imagine that he also came
from the East, and had plenty of sheep and goats; and when they add a
stone or branch to the heap, they mutter, 'Give us plenty of
cattle.'"—Among the Hottentots there are many such heaps, which they say
are the graves of Heitsi Kabip, who, according to them, died several
times and came to life again. (*Bleek. Hottentot Fables, p.* 76.)—Thus
the Heitsi Eibip of the Hottentots appears to have some relation to the
Unkulunkulu of the Kafirs.

 Such heaps of stones are common in the South Sea Islands, and are there
memorial heaps, as, it appears from the Scripture narrative, was that
which Jacob raised ([Gen. xxxi. 45](../../bib/kjv/gen.htm#31:45)-55); or
they may have been raised over graves, as is still the custom among the
Bedouins.

 "The bearers of the corpse reached the newly dug grave at the head of
the procession, and standing over it they slowly lowered the body, still
rolled in its rough camel-hair shroud, into it, as the solemn chant
suddenly ceased, and the silence which ensued seemed rendered deeper by
the contrast. The corpse having been stretched out in its sandy couch,
all those nearest the spot, with hands and feet, raked back the loose
earth over the grave and closed it up. Ali and the other chieftain with
him, each taking up a stone from the ground, now cast it in turn on the
tomb, uttering, 'Allah yerdano,' God have mercy on him! Naif, silent and
brooding, approached the spot, and with the same prayer cast his stone
likewise over his brother's tomb, adding, 'The duty of revenging thee
weighs upon me.'

 "All the other members of the tribe present followed their chief's
example, and pressed forward to pay their last tribute to the dead, a
stone cast on the grave, and a muttered prayer for his peace; <span
id="footnotes_page_67">p. 67</span> the multitudes crowding in
succession round the spot, or spreading over the plain to find a stone
to cast on the tomb in their turn. A high mound of loose stones rose
fast over the grave, increasing in size every minute as men, women, and
children continued swarming around it in turn, adding stone after stone
to the funereal pile." ("Sketches of the Desert and Bedouin Life." *The
Churchman's Companion. No. XII. December*, 1867, *p*. 524.)

 Is our ceremony of throwing earth into the grave a relic of this
ancient custom?

It is Thou, Thou Bush of Truth.  
It is Thou, Thou who sittest in the highest.

The Creator who madest the heavens also.  
The Maker of the stars and the Pleiades.  
The shooting stars declare it unto us.  
The Maker of the blind, of thine own will didst thou make them.  
The Trumpet speaks,—for us it calls.  
Thou art the Hunter who hunts for souls.  
Thou art the Leader who goes before us.  
Thou art the great Mantle which covers us.  
Thou art He whose hands are with wounds.  
Thou art He whose feet are with wounds.  
Thou art He whose blood is a trickling stream—and why?  
Thou art He whose blood was spilled for us.  
For this great price we call  
For thine own place we call.

 <span id="page_70_note_32"></span>[32](#page_70_fr_32) A very common
answer received from a native when asked who Unkulunkulu is, is, "Ukoko
wetu," Our ancestor. But now, through the course of years, no one
regards him as a relative; he is so far removed from all at present
living by intervening generations.

 <span id="page_71_note_33"></span>[33](#page_71_fr_33) That is, no one
can trace up his ancestry to the First Man. Such a notion manifests the
utter ignorance of the natives of the lapse of time since man was
created.

 <span id="page_71_note_34"></span>[34](#page_71_fr_34) We know that
Unkulunkulu was the first man, but if we were to attempt to give the
names of his children we could not make up a genealogy, for we are at
once lost, and cannot in any way connect him with people who are now
left.

<span id="footnotes_page_74">p. 74</span>

 <span id="page_74_note_35"></span>[35](#page_74_fr_35) He means to say,
that as regards the natives themselves, Unkulunkulu was something so far
off that they never thought of him; but that now this old man is being
brought forward by others as the object of a reverence which they never
rendered to him.

<span id="footnotes_page_75">p. 75</span>

 <span id="page_75_note_36"></span>[36](#page_75_fr_36) By this he
means, that praying to Unkulunkulu, the first man, would prove just as
great a deceit as children's calling to him; for as he could not appear
to them, so he cannot hear our prayers, for he is but a man like
ourselves, dead and buried long ago.

<span id="footnotes_page_76">p. 76</span>

 <span id="page_76_note_37"></span>[37](#page_76_fr_37) The native gives
the following explanation of his words here:—

>  I would say as regards the worship of Unkulunkulu, if we are made to

> do not see in what way he can help us; they are all alike.

 <span id="page_76_note_38"></span>[38](#page_76_fr_38) We have already
seen how prevalent is the tradition that man and all other things came
out of the earth. The natives of these parts confess they do not know
where this place is. But among other south African tribes, the tradition
is associated with a certain locality. Thus the Basutos and Lighoyas
point to a place which they call "Instuana-Tsatsi," which means the
East. Arbousset says:—

 "This spot is very celebrated amongst the Basutos and the Lighoyas, not
only because the *litakus* of the tribes are there, but because of a
certain mythos, in which they are told that their ancestors came
originally from that place. There is there a cavern surrounded with
marsh reeds and mud, whence they believe that they have all proceeded."
(*Arbousset. Op. cit.*, p. 198.)

 And among the Baperis, "at the base of a small mountain which they call
*Mole*, is a deep cavern called *Marimatle, fine bloods or pretty
races*, because they maintain that men and the other animals came out of
it; and not only so, but that the souls return thither after death; an
opinion which reminds one of the old pagan doctrine of the infernal
regions." (*Id., p.* 255.)

 Campbell also gives us a similar account:—

 "With respect to the origin of mankind, the old men had given him no
information; but there is a great hole in the Marootzee country out of
which men first came, and their footmarks are still to be <span
id="footnotes_page_77">p. 77</span> seen there. One man came out of it
long ago, but he went back, and is there yet. Morokey never saw the hole
himself, but his uncle, who is dead, had seen it, and saw the footmarks
very plain. The cattle also came from the same hole." (*Travels in South
Africa. Cambpbell. Vol. I., p.* 306.)

<span id="footnotes_page_79">p. 79</span>

 <span id="page_79_note_41"></span>[41](#page_79_fr_41) There is no
doubt that *Itongo* is Spirit; it is the general word employed to
express spiritual power, and, I think, ought to be used instead of
*umoya*.

<span id="footnotes_page_81">p. 81</span>

 <span id="page_81_note_42"></span>[42](#page_81_fr_42) The metaphor
here is borrowed from the peeling off of the skin of a new born child,
or the casting off of the skin by a snake, that it might be, as the
natives think, more perfect. The white man cast off the skin of
imperfection before leaving the source of being. The coloured man came
out with the skin of imperfection still adhering to him, and it has not
been cast off to this day.

<span id="footnotes_page_82">p. 82</span>

 <span id="page_82_note_43"></span>[43](#page_82_fr_43) Pringle
describes Makanna, the great Kafir prophet, as referring his mission to
"Uthlanga, the Great Spirit:"—

 "By his spirit-rousing eloquence, his pretended revelations from
Heaven, and his confident predictions of complete success, provided they
would implicitly follow his counsels, he persuaded the great majority of
the Amakxosa clans, including some of Hinza's captains, to unite their
forces for a simultaneous attack upon Graham's-town, the head-quarters
of the British troops. He told them that he was sent by Uthlanga, the
Great Spirit, to avenge their wrongs; that he had power to call up from
the grave the spirits of their ancestors to assist them in battle
against the English, whom they should drive, before they stopped, across
the Zwartkops river and into the ocean; 'and then,' said the prophet,
'we will sit down and eat honey!' Ignorant of our vast resources,
Makanna probably conceived that, this once effected, the contest was
over for ever with the usurping Europeans." (*Narrative of a Residence
in South Africa. Pringle, p.* 299.)

 It would be interesting to know what were the exact words used by
Makanna. Did he really use the words ascribed to him? or has Pringle
paraphrased for him? However this may be, it is clear that Pringle had
been led by his investigations among the Frontier Kafirs to conclude
that their idea of God is to be found in the word Uthlanga.

 Shaw also remarks:—

 "Before Missionaries and other Europeans had intercourse with the
Kaffirs, they seem to have had extremely vague and indistinct notions
concerning the existence of God. The older Kaffirs used to speak of
Umdali, the Creator or Maker of all things, and Uthlanga, which word
seems to have been used to denote the source or place from which all
living things came forth." (*Story of My Mission, p.* 451.)

 There can be no doubt that whilst Uthlanga is used by some to mean a
reed, which is supposed to have given origin to all things; and others
speak of Uthlanga as the place from which all things came out, yet the
majority give it a personal signification; and in tracing the tradition
backwards, we rest at last in Uthlanga as the word which of all others
has wrapped up in it the native idea of a Creator.

 <span id="page_82_note_44"></span>[44](#page_82_fr_44) This notion of
successive egressions from the centre of creation, which is a new idea
among the natives of this country, having arisen from a wish to explain
the difference between themselves and us, has its counterpart among the
native tribes of South America:—"They believe that their good deities
made the world, and that they first created the Indians in their caves,
gave them the lance, the bow and arrows, and the stone-bowls, to fight
and hunt with, and then turned them out to shift for themselves. They
imagine that the deities <span id="footnotes_page_83">p. 83</span> of
the Spaniards did the same by them; but that, instead of lances, bows,
etc., they gave them guns and swords. They suppose that when the beasts,
birds, and lesser animals were created, those of the more nimble kind
came immediately out of their caves; but that the bulls and cows being
the last, the Indians were so frightened at the sight of their horns,
that they stopped up the entrance of their caves with great stones. This
is the reason they give why they had no black cattle in their country
till the Spaniards brought them over, who more wisely had let them out
of the caves." (*Researches into the Early History of Mankind. Tylor,
p.* 313.)

 <span id="page_83_note_45"></span>[45](#page_83_fr_45) In accordance
with the answer invariably given by natives when referring to
Unkulunkulu, the first man.

 <span id="page_83_note_46"></span>[46](#page_83_fr_46) The native
teacher thinks he must here refer to the legend of the ascent of
Usenzangakona into heaven. [Note 4, p. 55](#page_55_note_4). This is
quite possible; and that in the statements which follow he might be
referring to supposed creative acts, which he ascribed to that chief.
Compare Ukoto's statement, [p. 50](#page_50), with that of Ubapa's
mother, [p. 55](#page_55), who sums up her faith with the statement,
that "the whitemen are the lords who made all things."

<span id="footnotes_page_84">p. 84</span>

 <span id="page_84_note_47"></span>[47](#page_84_fr_47) Compare what is
said, [p. 25](#page_25). The worship of Unkulunkulu consists in
rejoicing at what is supposed to be his gift, good or bad, and by
casting on him and his ordinance the responsibility of their own evil
doing.

 <span id="page_84_note_48"></span>[48](#page_84_fr_48) *Amadumbi*,
edible tubers, a kind of arum, which the natives cultivate. *Umthlaza*
is also an edible tuber.

 <span id="page_84_note_49"></span>[49](#page_84_fr_49) Or, Lord, or
King.

<span id="footnotes_page_85">p. 85</span>

 <span id="page_85_note_50"></span>[50](#page_85_fr_50) This is the only
instance I have met with in which even apparently a native has said that
prayer is made to Unkulunkulu, the first man. On the contrary, every
previous account implies the reverse. I cannot personally enquire of the
native who related the above, but there can be little doubt that he was
not alluding to Unkulunkulu, the first man; but to the head of the Zulu
nation, or of his own family—Onkulunkulu which are admitted on all hands
to be objects of worship and of prayer among the other Amatongo. Mr.
Shooter, in his work on Natal, says:—

 "The tradition of the Great-Great (Unkulunkulu) is not universally
known among the people. War, change, and the worship of false deities
have gradually darkened their minds and obscured their remembrance of
the true God. Captain Gardiner states that the generality of the people
were ignorant of it in his time." (*p*. 160.) See [Note 3, p.
54](#page_54_note_3). Captain Gardiner doubtless would find "the
generality of the people" utterly ignorant of an Unkulunkulu in heaven,
except as a part of their faith in such legends as that of the ascent of
Usenzangakona. But I have never yet met with any native old or young, of
Natal or Zululand, or from any part between Natal and the Cape, who was
ignorant of the tradition of an Unkulunkulu who came out of the earth,
the first man, who lived, gave laws to his children, and died.

 Again, Mr. Shooter says:—

 "There is a tribe in Natal which still worships the Great-Great
(Unkulunkulu), though the recollection of him is very dim. When they
kill the ox they say, 'Hear, Unkulunkulu, may it be always so.'" This
statement also appears to be the result of inaccurate investigation and
misapprehension. I never met with a case, neither have I met with any
native that has, in which Unkulunkulu is thus addressed. But the
Onkulunkulu of houses or tribes are addressed, not by the name
Unkulunkulu, but by their proper names, as Udumakade, Uzimase, &c.
Instances of this worship of the Onkulunkulu have been already given.
When we come to the "A<span class="small">MATONGO</span>" we shall see
more clearly what is really the nature of their worship, and that
Unkulunkulu, the first man, is of necessity shut out.

<span id="footnotes_page_86">p. 86</span>

 <span id="page_86_note_51"></span>[51](#page_86_fr_51) This was the
first time I had met with the word Unkulunkulwana <span
id="footnotes_page_87">p. 87</span> in my intercourse with the natives.
It is a diminutive, and means the lesser or inferior Unkulunkulu. But
Captain Gardiner mentions it in the following extract:—

 "It is agreed among the Zoolus, that their forefathers believed in the
existence of an overruling spirit, whom they called Villenangi
\[Umvelinqangi\] (literally the First Appearer), and who soon after
created another heavenly being of great power, called Koolukoolwani,
\[Unkulunkulwana,\] who once visited this earth, in order to publish the
news (as they express it), as also to separate the sexes and colours
among mankind. Duling the period he was below, two messages were sent to
him from Villenangi, the first conveyed by a cameleon, announcing that
men were not to die; the second, by a lizard, with a contrary decision.
The lizard, having outrun the slow-paced cameleon, arrived first, and
delivered his message before the latter made his apperance." (*p*. 178.)

 In an earlier part of his journal, after an interview with Udigane, he
says:—

 "But what was God, and God's word, and the nature of the instruction I
proposed, were subjects which he could not at all comprehend." (*p*.
31.)

<span id="footnotes_page_88">p. 88</span>

 <span id="page_88_note_53"></span>[53](#page_88_fr_53) These three were
great chiefs,—amakosi ohlanga,—who left their names as izibongo of their
respective tribes.

<span id="footnotes_page_89">p. 89</span>

 <span id="page_89_note_56"></span>[56](#page_89_fr_56) *Ukqili*, ikqili

Just as he is called *Umdali*, the breaker off, because he is supposed
to have been the instrumental agent by which all things were broken off
or separated from the source or place of being; and *Umenzi*, the maker,
because he is supposed to have made all things, so the personal name
*Ukqili* is applied to him to denote the wisdom manifested in the act of
creation.

<span id="footnotes_page_90">p. 90</span>

 <span id="page_90_note_57"></span>[57](#page_90_fr_57) This notion
appears to be frequently intimated in the legends of the origin of
man,—that not only Unkulunkulu came out of the bed of reeds, but
primitive men also (abantu bendulo). Unkulunkulu simply came out first;
they followed with cattle, &c. The abantu bendulo therefore were not his
offspring, but came out as they were from the same place as Unkulunkulu.
An old Ikqwabi, in relating the legend, said that Unkulunkulu was a
great man; he sat in a hole, somewhere near the Umtshezi, a river in
Zululand, appearing with his body only above the ground, and thus
sitting moulded all things. By this we are to understand that the
Amakqwabi's traditional centre from which they sprang is on the
Umtshezi.

 <span id="page_90_note_58"></span>[58](#page_90_fr_58) By Uthlanga
meaning apparently the place from which Unkulunkulu and all other things
came.

<span id="footnotes_page_91">p. 91</span>

 <span id="page_91_note_60"></span>[60](#page_91_fr_60) I had never
before met with a native who thus separated Ukulukulu from Unkulunkulu.
It is the reduplication of *ukulu* which is never, so far as I know,
nasalised; and is equivalent to unkulunkulwana, the diminutive of
unkulunkulu. Below we shall find another native making a similar
distinction. But the majority of natives deny the correctness of this
distinction.

 <span id="page_91_note_61"></span>[61](#page_91_fr_61) By this he means
to say that Unkulunkulu no longer exists; that he has died like all
others, young and old.

 <span id="page_91_note_62"></span>[62](#page_91_fr_62) *Isitunzi*,
shade.—This is, doubtless, a word formerly used for the spirit of man,
just as among the Greeks, Romans, &c. And scarcely any thing can more
clearly prove the degradation which has fallen on the natives than their
not understanding that isitunzi meant the spirit, and not merely the
shadow cast by the body; for there now exists among them the strange
belief that the dead body casts no shadow; and when they say, "Isitunzi
si muke," The shade has departed, they do not mean that the soul has
left its tenement, but that the body has ceased to cast a shadow.

 {See also the [additional note](rsa05).}

 <span id="page_91_note_63"></span>[63](#page_91_fr_63) He said Uhhadebe
was an Ithlubi, that is, one of the tribe of the Amathlubi.

<span id="footnotes_page_92">p. 92</span>

 <span id="page_92_note_64"></span>[64](#page_92_fr_64) Compare this
with the account given [p. 84](#page_84), which it entirely
corroborates; the Unkulunkulu of each tribe is the object of that
tribe's veneration and worship. It may be as well also to note that,
according to Burton, the Dahomans salute their king by crying,
"Grandfather, grandfather."

 <span id="page_92_note_65"></span>[65](#page_92_fr_65) Black cattle are

cattle of Umzimu, that is, of the Itongo—especially dedicated to the
Itongo. Captain Burton mentions a word very much like this, as being
used for Ancestral Ghosts,—Muzimos,—among the people to the South-east
of Dahome. (*Op. cit. Vol. II., p.* 20.)

 <span id="page_94_note_69"></span>[69](#page_94_fr_69) *Isanda
selizwe*.—*Isanda* is breadth which supports something upon it. Thus a
table, bed, or sofa may be called an *isanda*. But here it means not
only breadth supporting; but *the power underneath*, from which the
support comes. The following was given as an explanation:—

native distinctly stating that the founder of his tribe was the first
man,—that is, he confounds the first Unkulunkulu with the founder of his
own tribe, who, he asserts was the creator of all things, in the native
sense of creation. Let the reader consider how easy it is entirely to
mistake the meaning of such statements. And how unmistakeably it proves
that the natives believe that the Unkulunkulu of all men was himself a
man.
