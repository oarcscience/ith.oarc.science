<p>Owing to The Militant Objections to the Rise of the Church Triumphant, We had to have DETAINED Map-Making &amp; Atlas Work, for much important Reasons.<br> The ENGRAVING Department, and The Atlas &amp; Map-Making Philosopher, had much diffuculties with the Militant Power in the New Bible Land.<br> I, being The Triumphant Architect of the Church Triumphant I had UNTOLD Difficulties with the GENERATION of the 20th Century.</p>  
<p>They were all, being Stung with the Sting of Death &amp; SHAME and were not ABLE to APPRECIATE THE POWER OF LIFE.</p>  
<p>Several groups of Books have been destroyed by the Militant Dread-nought in Different Continents of the Globe.<br> A great deal of Money has been lost, by TRUSTING it into the Hands of dishonest peoples.<br> THIS CODE is CALLED The Register Office of Black Supremacy.<br> Educated Men of ALL SHADES of Learning, are WANTED with money and without money. The same is applied to Women and Young people.</p>
