His work of Six thousand years, from B.C. 4004 to 5.O.C.P.M. January 3rd 1926.<br> The Old Testament has no Book in Abraham's name, not even one like (Obadiah).</p>

<p>The Man with the one (tallent). Obadiah was a SLAVE in King Ahab's House, yet he could make the efforts to write one called the Book of Obadiah.<br> SPECIAL NOTICE<br> So therefore, as far as Old Testament Books are concerned from Genesis to Malachi, are (39) Work-Men and Women.<br> (Ruth and Queen Estha) among the men on gospel journey.<br> Well SINCE a man has right to pay without Work, this world can also work with pay.</p>
