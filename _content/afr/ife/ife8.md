<td>     Forgotten lives were lived, and shadowy priests<br />
Kept warm the altars of the departed Gods:<br />
Old men went softly to the River's lip<span id="page_46_fr_1"></span><a href="#page_46_note_1">1</a><br />
Unsung: 'twixt hope and fear mute colonists<br />
Went forth to the strange forests of the World;<br />
And unremembered wives sought out the shrines<br />
Of the givers of new life. Their names are lost. . .<br />
 <br />
     Yet now, Oíbo, let a final tale<br />
Be told; for, at the last, that silent age<br />
Yields up the legend of its fall. In those<br />
Last tranquil years the mothers blessed King Ógun<br />
For peaceful days and night's security;<br />
And old men used to tell of their brave deeds<br />
In battles where Orányan led, applaud<br />
The torch-lit dance and pass their last calm days<br />
Happily. . . But then came traders from the wilds<br />
<span id="page_47">p. 47</span> By thorn and tangle of scarce-trodden ways<br />
Through the dim woods with wondrous tales they heard<br />
At crossway markets<span id="page_47_fr_1"></span><a href="#page_47_note_1">1</a> in far lands of deeds<br />
Orányan did on battlefields beyond<br />
The region of the forests. These tales, oft-told<br />
In house and market, filled the air with rumours<br />
And dreams of war which troubled the repose<br />
Of ancient Ífè—for, while the fathers feared<br />
The coming of the day when the grey God,<br />
Aweary of Earth's Kingship, would go back<br />
To his first far-off home, the young men's dreams<br />
Were always of Orányan, and their pale days</td>

<td data-valign="top"><em>Orányan<br />
returns<br />
from<br />
distant<br />
Wars to<br />
demand the<br />
crown.</em></td>
<td>Lagged by. . . Such were the various thoughts of men<br />
In Ífè, when on a clay, unheralded,<br />
Orányan<span id="page_47_fr_2"></span><a href="#page_47_note_2">2</a> with a host appeared before<br />
Her peaceful gates. None could deny his entrance:<br />
The hero strode again the streets he saved<br />
From the Olúbo's grass-clad men, and came<br />
Before his father to demand the crown<br />
Of Odudúwa. King Ógun spoke: "My son,<br />
<span id="page_48">p. 48</span> 'Tis long since you were here, and you are welcome.<br />
But why with these armed men do you recall<br />
Times well-forgotten and the ancient wars?<br />
This is a land of peace: beneath the shade<br />
Of Ífè's trees the mirth of Heaven's vales<br />
Has found a home, the chorus and the dance<br />
Their measure. Lay by your arms, and may no hurt<br />
Attend your coming or your restful hours!"<br />
Harshly Orányan answered his old father:<br />
"You speak of peace, Great Ógun, and the calm<br />
Arámfè destined for a World to be.<br />
Arámfè spoke—and Odudúwa's dream<br />
Of wisdom linked to supreme power begat<br />
A theft!<span id="page_48_fr_1"></span><a href="#page_48_note_1">1</a> And that same night on Heaven's rim<br />
Devised another destiny for men.<br />
What Heaven-sent art has Ógun to undo<br />
That deed, and bid the still-born live? Besides,<br />
Who taught the peaceful peoples of the World<br />
Their longing for red War? Who forged their weapons—<br />
With steel Arámfè gave for harvesting?<br />
Who slew young maids who would not wed to bear<br />
<span id="page_49">p. 49</span> More sons for ancient wars? Who, pray, but Ógun,<br />
The God of War? . . What then? 'Tis said: 'The field<br />
The father sowed his son shall reap!'"<span id="page_49_fr_1"></span><a href="#page_49_note_1">1</a> And Ógun<br />
Made answer: "The story of my life has been<br />
As the succeeding seasons in the course<br />
Where Óshun pours her stream. First, long ago,<br />
The sunny months of heaven when I roamed<br />
A careless boy upon the mountains; then,<br />
As a whole season when the boisterous storms<br />
Fill full the crag-strewn bed with racing waters,<br />
And the warm Sun is hidden by the clouds,<br />
Doom brought me journeys, toils in darkness, wars<br />
And yet more wars. Again the barren months<br />
Are here: the wagtail lights upon the rock<br />
The river hid; a lazy trickle moves<br />
And in my age Arámfè's promised peace<br />
Gives back her stolen happiness to Ífè. . . .<br />
And now, the sage Osányi<span id="page_49_fr_2"></span><a href="#page_49_note_2">2</a> is no more,<br />
His charms forgotten: I cannot turn to stone<br />
And vanish like Odúwa; I cannot cast<br />
<span id="page_50">p. 50</span> My worn old body down to rise instead<br />
A river of the land, as Óshun did.<br />
No, Earth must hold me, glad or desolate,<br />
A King or outcast in the vague forest,<br />
Till Heaven call me—when the locked pools bask,<br />
And Óshun sleeps. . . Till then I ask to be<br />
In peace; and, with my tale of days accomplished,<br />
My last arts taught, Arámfè's bidding done—<br />
I, the lone God on Earth who knows fair Heaven,<br />
And the calm life the Father bade us give<br />
To men,—I, Ógun, will make way, and go<br />
Upon the road I came." But Orányan said:<br />
"Let the first Mistress of the World decide.<br />
These years the kingly power has passed away<br />
From the old sleeping town Odúwa built<br />
To me, Orányan, battling in far lands<br />
Where no voice spoke of Ífè. Let Ífè choose<br />
Her way: obscurity or wide renown!"<br />
     A silence fell: the black clouds of the storm<br />
Were overhanging human destiny;<br />
The breathless pause before the loud wind's blast<br />
Held all men speechless—though they seemed to heave</td>

<td data-valign="top"><em>The old<br />

remain;</em></td>
<td><span id="page_51">p. 51</span> For utterance. At length, Eléffon, the friend<br />
Of Ógun, voiced the fond hopes of the old chiefs<br />
Who feared Orányan and his coming day:<br />
"Ours is the city of the shrines which guard<br />
The spirits of the Gods, and all our ways<br />
Are ordered by the Presences which haunt<br />
The sacred precincts. The noise of war and tumult<br />
Is far from those who dream beneath the trees<br />
Of Ífè. There is another way of life:<br />
The way of colonists. By God's command,<br />
From this first breast the infant nations stray<br />
To the utter marches of humanity.<br />
Let them press onward, and let Orányan lead them<br />
Till the far corners of the World be filled;<br />
Let the unruly fall before their sword<br />
Until the Law prevail. But let not Ífè<br />
Swerve from the cool road of her destiny<br />
For dreams of conquest; and let not Ógun leave<br />
The roof, the evening firelight and the ways<br />
Of men—to go forth to the naked woods."<br />
And the old chiefs echoed: "Live with us yet, Oh, Ógun!<br />
Reign on your stable throne." But murmurs rose</td>

Until their leader, gaining courage, cried:<br />
"Empty our life has been—while from far plains,<br />
Vibrant with the romance, the living lustre,<br />
Orányan's name bestows, great rumours came<br />
To mock our laggard seasons; and each year<br />
Mórimi's festival recalls alike<br />
The hero's name and Ífè's greatness. Must<br />
All Ífè slumber that the old may drowse?<br />
No; we will have Orányan, and no other,<br />
To be our King." And a loud cry went up<br />
From his followers: "Orányan is our King!"<br />
And in that cry King Ógun heard the doom<br />
A chieftain of our day sees clear in eggs<span id="page_52_fr_1"></span><a href="#page_52_note_1">1</a><br />
Of fateful parrots in his inmost chamber:<br />
The walls of his proud city (his old defence)<br />
Can never more uphold a rule of iron<br />
For victor treachery within. And wearily<br />
He spoke his last sad words: "My boyhood scarce<br />
Had ended on Arámfè's happy hills<br />
<span id="page_53">p. 53</span> When I came here with Odudúwa; with him,<br />
Lovingly I watched this ancient city growing,<br />
And planted the grand forests for a robe<br />
For queenly Ífè. I have grown old with Ífè:<br />
Sometimes I feel that Ógun did become<br />
Ífè, and Ífè Ógun, with the still lapse</td>

<td data-valign="top"><em>Ógun goes<br />
away.</em></td>
<td>Of years. Yet she rejects me. Ah! my trees<br />
Would be more kind, and to my trees I go."<br />
 <br />
     Dawn came; and Ógun stood upon a hill<br />
To Westward, and turned to take a last farewell<br />
Of his old queen of cities—but white and dense.<br />
O'er harbouring woods and unremembering Ífè<br />
A mist was laid and blotted all. . Beyond,<br />
As islands from a morning sea, arose<br />
Two lone grey hills; and Ógun dreamed he saw<br />
Again those early days, an age gone by,<br />
When he and Great Odúwa watched the Bird<br />
Found those grand hills with magic sand,—bare slopes,<br />
Yet born to smile. . . That vision paled: red-gold<br />
Above grey clouds the Sun of yesterday<br />
Climbed up—to shine on a new order. . So passed<br />
Old Ógun from the land.</td>
