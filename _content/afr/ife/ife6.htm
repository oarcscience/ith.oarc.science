<TD><I>Ar&aacute;ba continues:</I><BR>
O&iacute;bo I have told you of the days<BR>
When Odud&uacute;wa and Or&iacute;sha fought;<BR>
But of the times of peace our annals hold<BR>
Strange legends also. . . Now in the age when mirth<BR>
And Odud&uacute;wa reigned, grief ever-growing<BR>
Befell Great M&oacute;rimi, the wife of skilled</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>M&oacute;rimi<BR>has no<BR>sons,</I></TD>
<TD>Ob&aacute;lufon&#8212;for while his lesser wives<BR>
Proudly bore many sons unto their lord,<BR>
A daughter only, young Ad&eacute;to&uacute;n,<BR>
Was granted to his queen. And as the years<BR>
Lagged by, a strangeness which he always seemed<BR>
To keep in hiding chequered the fair day<BR>
With doubtings, and waylaid her in the paths<BR>
Of her fond nightly dreams. Once with the Spring,<BR>
She saw the clustered tree-tops breaking into leaf<BR>
Copper and red and every green, and she<BR>
Remembered how beneath the new year's buds<BR>
It was ordained by Pereg&uacute;n &#8217;Gbo, lord<BR>
Of uninhabitable woods that Life<BR>

<!------------------------page 36------------------------>

<A NAME="page_36"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 36</FONT></A>

Should spring from Forest, and Life from Life,&#8212;till all<BR>
The Woods were gladdened with the voice of beasts<BR>
And birds&#8212;and thus she reasoned: "Is it not told<BR>
How Pereg&uacute;n &#8217;Gbo<A NAME="page_36_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_36_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A> spoke, and from the womb<BR>
Of Forest leaped the sloth that laughs by night?<BR>
How 'mid the boughs the sloth brought forth the ape<BR>
That bore the leopard? And did not Pereg&uacute;n<BR>
Watch o'er the birth of young Or&uacute;nmila,<BR>
And ever, when the morrow's sorrowing dawn<BR>
Must yield up to the leaguing fiends the child's<BR>
Fair life, did not the watchful God send down<BR>
His messenger to stay the grasping hand<BR>
Of Death? Thus do the Gods; and surely one<BR>
Will give me sons. Ah! whom must I appease?"</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>She<BR>consults<BR>&Iacute;fa:</I></TD>
<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick with new hope Great M&oacute;rimi sought out<BR>
A priest of &Iacute;fa<A NAME="page_36_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_36_note_2"><FONT size=1>2</FONT></A> in his court yard dim,<BR>
Where from each beam and smoke-grimed pillar hung<BR>
The charms the wise man set to guard his home,<BR>
His wives and children from the ills contrived<BR>

<!------------------------page 37------------------------>

By the bad spirits. To her gift she whispered,<BR>
And laid it on Okp&eacute;ll&egrave;; and the priest<BR>
Seizing the charm of &Iacute;fa said: "Okp&eacute;ll&egrave;,<BR>
To you the woe of M&oacute;rimi is known;<BR>
You only can reveal its secret cause,<BR>
Its unknown cure!" Then he laid down the charm<BR>
And &Oacute;ffun K&aacute;nran stood before them. The face<BR>
Of &Iacute;fa's priest was troubled, and he said:</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>Who tells<BR>her to<BR>sacrifice<BR>her<BR>daughter.</I></TD>
<TD>"M&oacute;rimi, this is the message of my lord<BR>
&Iacute;fa: a son, nay many sons, you long for.<BR>
You have a daughter, and your husband's love<BR>
Was yours. The Gods would give you many sons,<BR>
But in your path stands &Eacute;shu, the Undoer,<BR>
Whose shrine calls out for blood, for sacrifice:<BR>
Ad&eacute;to&uacute;n." Without hope M&oacute;rimi<BR>
Went forth, and loathing of the ways of the Gods<BR>
Possessed her&#8212;while indignation fed her love<BR>
Of her one child. . . .</TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD>
<TD align=right>The months passed by: Moons came,</TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD>
<TD>And in the smiles of happier wives she read<BR>
A mockery; Moons faded from the sky,<BR>
And grief and her Ad&eacute;to&uacute;n remained<BR>
Companions of her hours. At last she cried:<BR>
"But sons l asked for; I will go again<BR>

<!------------------------page 38------------------------>

<A NAME="page_38"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 38</FONT></A>

And pray for sons and my Ad&eacute;to&uacute;n.<BR>
The last word is not yet. Ol&oacute;kun's tide<BR>
Has ebbed: will it not flow again?"</TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD>
<TD align=right>Yet hope</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>She<BR>consults<BR>&Iacute;fa again.</I></TD>
<TD>Went not with M&oacute;rimi to the dark court<BR>
Of &Iacute;fa's priest; and when a torch disclosed<BR>
The self-same bode of sorrow in the dusk&#8212;<BR>
To her drear home Great M&oacute;rimi fled back<BR>
In terror of the deed which love commanded,<BR>
And love condemned. . . . Silently in the night</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>&Eacute;di advises<BR>her to act<BR>on &Iacute;fa's<BR>message.</I></TD>
<TD>Came &Eacute;di, the Perverter, the smooth of tongue,<BR>
Who with his guileful reasoning compels<BR>
To conscious sin: "The forms of messengers<BR>
Reveal the thoughts of &Iacute;fa, and the ears<BR>
Of &Iacute;fa, the God-Messenger, have heard<BR>
The far-off, thundrous voice. Would you hold back?<BR>
Is not the birth of Nations the first law<BR>
Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; gave? Can any wife withstand<BR>
His will, or maid stern &Oacute;gun's call?<A NAME="page_38_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_38_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A> To-day<BR>
Is yours, oh, mother of great kings that shall be:<BR>
The green shoots greet the Spring-rain and forget<BR>
The barren months, and M&oacute;rimi shall know<BR>
Her grief and her reproach no more." Then doubt<BR>

<!------------------------page 39------------------------>

<A NAME="page_39"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 39</FONT></A>

Seized M&oacute;rimi but still she answered; "Will Gods<BR>
Not give? Is the grim World a morning market<BR>
Where they drive bargains with the folk they made?<BR>
Are babes as bangles which Ob&aacute;lufon<BR>
Fashions to barter?" But &Eacute;di answered her:<BR>
"But once Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; spoke to Odud&uacute;wa,<BR>
And with what heavy hearts the Gods went forth<BR>
From Heaven's valleys to the blackness! Now thrice,<A NAME="page_39_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_39_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A><BR>
Thrice to the woman M&oacute;rimi the word<BR>
Has come&#8212;with promise of the World's desire:<BR>
Not every wife is chosen for the mother<BR>
Of a house of kings. And think!&#8212;Ob&aacute;lufon!"<BR>
Then &Eacute;di, the Perverter, hid his form<BR>
In darkness; and with the dawn a young girl lay</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>The death<BR>of Ad&eacute;to&uacute;n.</I></TD>
<TD>On the Undoer &Eacute;shu's altar&#8212;while<BR>
The lazy blue of early morning smoke<BR>
Crept up the pass between the hills.</TD></TR>
