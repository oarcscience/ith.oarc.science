<TD><I>Ar&aacute;ba speaks:</I><BR>
I am the voice of &Iacute;fa, messenger<BR>
Of all the Gods: to me the histories<BR>
Are known, and I will tell you of the days<BR>
Of the Descent. How Old Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; sent<BR>
The Gods from Heaven, and Odud&uacute;wa stole<BR>
The bag&#8212;my king has told you. . . For many a day<BR>
Across unwatered plains the Great Ones journeyed,<BR>
And sandy deserts&#8212;for such is the stern bar<BR>
Set by Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; 'twixt his smiling vales</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>The Gods<BR>arrive at<BR>the edge of<BR>Heaven.</I></TD>
<TD>And the stark cliff's edge which his sons approached<BR>
Tremblingly, till from the sandy brink they peered<BR>
Down the sheer precipice. Behind them lay<BR>
The parched, forbidding leagues; but yet the Sun<BR>
Was there, and breezes soft, and yet the mountains&#8212;<BR>
A faded line beyond the shimmering waste&#8212;<BR>
Called back to mind their ancient home. Beneath<BR>
Hung chaos&#8212;dank blackness and the threatening roar<BR>
Of untamed waters. Then Odud&uacute;wa spoke:<BR>
"Or&iacute;sha, what did we? And what fault was ours?<BR>
Outcasts to-day; to-morrow we must seek<BR>
Our destiny in dungeons, and beneath<BR>

<!------------------------page 21------------------------>

<A NAME="page_21"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 21</FONT></A>

That yawning blackness we must found a city<BR>
For unborn men. Better a homeless life<BR>
In desert places: dare we turn and flee<BR>
To some lost valley of the hills? Or&iacute;sha,<BR>
What think you?" Then spoke Or&iacute;sha whom men call<BR>
The Great: "Is this Od&uacute;wa that I hear&#8212;<BR>
My mother's son who stole Ar&aacute;mf&egrave;'s gift,<BR>
And thought to filch away the hearts of men<BR>
With blessings which were mine to give? For me,<BR>
The arts I know I long to use, and yearn<BR>
To see the first of toiling, living men<BR>
That I shall make. Forbidding is our task,<BR>
You say&#8212;but think, ere we return to peace<BR>
And Heaven's calm, how boundless is the fate<BR>
You flinch from! Besides, is Godhead blind?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD>
<TD align=right>You think</TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD>
<TD>Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; would not know? Has Might no bodes<BR>
With eyes and ears? . . Dumb spirits hungering</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>Od&uacute;wa<BR>sends<BR>Oj&uacute;mu<BR>with the<BR>Bird,</I></TD>
<TD>For life await us: let us go." So spoke<BR>
Or&iacute;sha; and Od&uacute;wa hung a chain<BR>
Over the cliff to the dark water's face,<BR>
And sent Oj&uacute;mu, the wise priest, to pour<BR>
The magic sand upon the sea and loose<BR>

The five-clawed Bird to scatter far and wide<BR>
Triumphant land.<A NAME="page_22_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_22_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A> But, as Earth's ramparts grew,<BR>
Ever in the darkness came the waves and sucked<BR>
Away the crumbling shore, while foot by foot<BR>
Lagoons crept up, and turned to reedy swamps<BR>
The soil of hope. So Odud&uacute;wa called</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>and<BR>Ol&oacute;kun and<BR>Ol&oacute;ssa.</I></TD>
<TD>Ol&oacute;kun<A NAME="page_22_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_22_note_2"><FONT size=1>2</FONT></A> and Ol&oacute;ssa<A NAME="page_22_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_22_note_3"><FONT size=1>3</FONT></A> to the cliff<BR>
And thus he spoke: "Beneath, the waters wrestle<BR>
With the new-rising World, and would destroy<BR>
Our kingdom and undo Ar&aacute;mf&egrave;'s will.<BR>
Go to the fields of men to be, the homes<BR>
That they shall make. Ol&oacute;kun! to the sea!<BR>
For there your rule and your dominion shall be:<BR>
To curb the hungry waves upon the coastlands<BR>
For ever. And thus, in our first queen of cities<BR>
And secret sanctuaries on lonely shores<BR>
Through every &aelig;on as the season comes,<BR>
Shall men bring gifts in homage to Ol&oacute;kun.<BR>
And you, Ol&oacute;ssa, where your ripple laps<BR>
The fruitful bank, shan see continually<BR>
The offerings of thankful men."</TD></TR>

The months</TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD>
<TD>Of Heaven passed by, while in the moonless night</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>The Bird<BR>makes the<BR>Earth,</I></TD>
<TD>Beneath the Bird toiled on until the bounds,<BR>
The corners of the World were steadfast. And then<BR>
Od&uacute;wa called Or&iacute;sha and the Gods<BR>
To the cliff's edge, and spoke these words of sorrow:<BR>
"We go to our sad kingdom. Such is the will<BR>
Of Old Ar&aacute;mf&egrave;: so let it be. But ere<BR>
The hour the wilderness which gapes for us<BR>
Engulf us utterly, ere the lingering sight<BR>
Of those loved hills can gladden us no more&#8212;<BR>
May we not dream awhile of smiling days<BR>
Gone by? . . Fair was drenched morning in the Sun<BR>
When dark the hill-tops rose o'er misty hollows;<BR>
Fair were the leafy trees of night beneath<BR>
The silvering Moon, and beautiful the wind<BR>
Upon the grasslands. Good-bye, ye plains we roamed.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>The Gods<BR>descend.</I></TD>
<TD>Good-bye to sunlight and the shifting shadows<BR>
Cast on the crags of Heaven's blue hills. Ah! wine<BR>
Of Heaven, farewell" . . . So came the Gods to &Iacute;f&egrave;.<BR>
Then of an age of passing months untold<BR>
By wanings of the Moon our lore repeats</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>A sunless<BR>World.</I></TD>

The dirge of wasting hopes and the lament<BR>
Of a people in a strange World shuddering<BR>
Beneath the thunder of the unseen waves<BR>
On crumbling shores around. Always the marsh<BR>
Pressed eagerly on &Iacute;f&egrave;; but ever the Bird<BR>
Returned with the unconquerable sand<BR>
Oj&uacute;mu poured from his enchanted shell,<BR>
And the marsh yielded. Then young &Oacute;gun bade<BR>
The Forest grow her whispering trees&#8212;but she<BR>
Budded the pallid shoots of hopeless night,<BR>
And all was sorrow round the sodden town<BR>
Where Odud&uacute;wa reigned. Yet for live men</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>Or&iacute;sha<BR>creates<BR>man.</I></TD>
<TD>Or&iacute;sha, the Creator, yearned, and called<BR>
To him the longing shades from other glooms;<BR>
He threw their images<A NAME="page_24_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_24_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A> into the wombs<BR>
Of Night, Ol&oacute;kun and Ol&oacute;ssa, and all<BR>
The wives of the great Gods bore babes with eyes<BR>
Of those born blind&#8212;unknowing of their want&#8212;<BR>
And limbs to feel the heartless wind which blew<BR>
From outer nowhere to the murk beyond. . .<BR>
But as the unconscious years wore by, Or&iacute;sha,<BR>
The Creator, watched the unlit Dawn of Man<BR>
Wistfully&#8212;as one who follows the set flight<BR>

Of a lone sea-bird when the sunset fades<BR>
Beyond a marshy wilderness&#8212;and spoke<BR>
To Odud&uacute;wa: "Our day is endless night,<BR>
And deep, wan woods enclose our weeping children.<BR>
The Ocean menaces, chill winds moan through<BR>
Our mouldering homes. Our guardian Night, who spoke<BR>
To us with her strange sounds in the still hours<BR>
Of Heaven is here; yet she can but bewail<BR>
Her restless task. And where is Evening? Oh! where<BR>
Is Dawn?" He ceased, and Odud&uacute;wa sent<BR>
&Iacute;fa, the Messenger, to his old sire<BR>
To crave the Sun and the warm flame that lit<BR>
The torch of Heaven's Evening and the dance. . .</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>Ar&aacute;mf&egrave;<BR>sends fire,<BR>the Sun<BR>and the<BR>Moon.</I></TD>
<TD>A deep compassion moved thundrous Ar&aacute;mf&egrave;,<BR>
The Father of the Gods, and he sent down<BR>
The vulture with red fire upon his head<BR>
For men; and, by the Gods' command, the bird<BR>
Still wears no plumage where those embers burned him&#8212;<BR>
A mark of honour for remembrance. Again<BR>
The Father spoke the word, and the pale Moon<BR>
Sought out the precincts of calm Night's retreat<BR>

To share her watch on Darkness; and Day took wings,<BR>
And flew to the broad spaces of the sky&#8212;<BR>
To roam benignant from the floating mists<BR>
Which cling to hillsides of the Dawn&#8212;to Eve<BR>
Who calls the happy toilers home.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD>
<TD align=right>And all</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>The Age<BR>of Mirth.</I></TD>
<TD>Was changed: for when the terror of bright Day<BR>
Had lifted from the unused eyes of men,<BR>
Sparks flew from L&aacute;di's anvil, while &Oacute;gun taught<BR>
The use of iron, and wise Ob&aacute;lufon<A NAME="page_26_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_26_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A><BR>
Made brazen vessels and showed how wine streams out<BR>
From the slim palms.<A NAME="page_26_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_26_note_2"><FONT size=1>2</FONT></A> And in the night the Gods<BR>
Set torches in their thronging courts to light<BR>
The dance, and Heaven's music touched the drum<BR>
Once more as in its ancient home. And mirth<BR>
With Odud&uacute;wa reigned.</TD></TR>
