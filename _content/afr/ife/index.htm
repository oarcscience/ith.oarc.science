<P>This short book is a translation of some of the myths of the Yoruba people of Nigeria. It is a history of the creation of the world, the gods, and humanity, and the early days of the sacred city of &Iacute;f&egrave;, the traditional center of Yoruba culture. The text was recited to the author/translator by the high priests of &Iacute;f&egrave;, and the book is still cited in some books on traditional Yoruba religion and thought today. It has undeservedly become quite rare, as it  can be considered a minor classic in the field.</P>
