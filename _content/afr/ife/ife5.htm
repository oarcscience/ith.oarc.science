<TABLE>
<TR><TD></TD>
<TD><I>Ar&aacute;ba continues:</I><BR>
O&iacute;bo, I will tell and chronicle<BR>
A second chapter from the histories</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>The fable<BR>of Earth,<BR>Water and<BR>Forest</I></TD>
<TD>Bequeathed from other times. . . A tale is told<BR>
How God in the Beginning sent three sons<BR>
Into the World&#8212;Earth, Water and the Forest&#8212;<BR>
With one and twenty gifts for Earth and men<BR>
That are the sons of Earth; and all save one<BR>
The Forest and the Rivers stole; and how<BR>
God promised to his first-born, Earth, that men<BR>
Should win the twenty gifts again by virtue<BR>
Of that last one, Good Humour. And this is true:<BR>
For in those years when &Oacute;gun and the Gods<BR>
Made known their handicrafts men learned to seek<BR>
Thatch, food and wine in Forest and in River</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>Strife<BR>between<BR>Od&uacute;wa and<BR>Or&iacute;sha</I></TD>
<TD>Patiently. So Man prevailed; but in those days<BR>
Came strife and turmoil to the Gods&#8212;for still<BR>
For jealousy and pride Od&uacute;wa held<BR>
The bag Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; gave to Great Or&iacute;sha.<BR>
Often Or&iacute;sha made entreaty; oft<BR>
A suppliant came before his brother&#8212;in vain;<BR>
Till once when Odud&uacute;wa sat with &Oacute;gun<BR>

<!------------------------page 28------------------------>

<A NAME="page_28"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 28</FONT></A>

In that same palace where the &Oacute;rn&iacute; reigns,<BR>
The sound of drums was heard and Great Or&iacute;sha<BR>
Approached with skilled Ob&aacute;lufon, and said:<BR>
"The time has come to teach Ar&aacute;mf&egrave;'s arts<BR>
"To men. Give back the bag (for it is mine!)<BR>
That I may do our Father's bidding. Else,<BR>
Have a care, is it not told how caution slept<BR>
In the still woods when the proud leopard fell,<BR>
Lured on by silence, 'neath the monster's foot?"<A NAME="page_28_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_28_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A><BR>
Then was Od&uacute;wa angered exceedingly:<BR>
"Am I not king? Did not Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; make<BR>
Me lord of Gods and men? Begone! Who speaks<BR>
Unseemly words before the king has packed<BR>
His load."<A NAME="page_28_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_28_note_2"><FONT size=1>2</FONT></A></TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD>
<TD align=right>Or&iacute;sha and Od&uacute;wa called</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>brings war<BR>to &Iacute;f&egrave;.</I></TD>
<TD>To arms their followings of Gods and men,<BR>
And on that day the first of wars began<BR>
In &Iacute;f&egrave; and the Forest. Such was the fall<BR>
Of the Gods from paths divine, and such for men<BR>
The woe that Odud&uacute;wa's theft prepared;<BR>
But little the Gods recked of their deep guilt<BR>

<!------------------------page 29------------------------>

Till darkness fell and all was quiet&#8212;for then<BR>
Returned the memory of Calm, their heritage,<BR>
Of Heaven born and destined for the World;<BR>
Gloom, too, with the still night came down: a sense<BR>
Of impious wrong, ungodly sin, weighed down<BR>
Warriors aweary, and all was changed. Around,<BR>
Dead, dead the Forest seemed, its boughs unstirred;<BR>
Dead too, amidst its strangling, knotted growth<BR>
The stifled air&#8212;while on that hush, the storm's</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>Ar&aacute;mf&egrave;<BR>tries to<BR>stop it;</I></TD>
<TD>Mute herald, came the distant thundrous voice<BR>
Of Old Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; as he mused: "In vain<BR>
Into the Waste beneath I sent my sons&#8212;<BR>
The children of my happy vales&#8212;to make<BR>
A World of mirth: for desolation holds<BR>
The homes of &Iacute;f&egrave;, and women with their babes<BR>
Are outcast in the naked woods." But when<BR>
The whirling clouds were wheeling in the sky<BR>
And the great trees were smitten by the wind,<BR>
Thundrous Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; in his ire rebuked<BR>
His erring sons: "At my command you came<BR>
To darkness, where the Evil of the Void&#8212;<BR>
Insentient Violence&#8212;had made its home,<BR>
To shape in the Abyss a World of joy<BR>

<!------------------------page 30------------------------>

<A NAME="page_30"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 30</FONT></A>

And lead Creation in the ways of Heaven.<BR>
How, then, this brawling? Did the Void's black soul<BR>
Outmatch you, or possess your hearts to come<BR>
Again into its own? For Man's misfortune<BR>
I grieve; but you have borne them on the tide<BR>
Of your wrong-doing, and your punishment<BR>
Is theirs to share. For now my thunderbolts<BR>
I hurl, with deluges upon the land&#8212;<BR>
To fill the marshes and lagoons, and stay<BR>
For aye your impious war."</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>but fails.</I></TD>
<TD align=right>Dawn came; the storm</TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD>
<TD>Was gone, and Old Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; in his grief<BR>
Departed on black clouds. But still the wrath,<BR>
But still the anger of his sons endured,<BR>
And in the dripping forests and the marshes<BR>
The rebel Gods fought on&#8212;while in the clouds<BR>
Afar Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; reasoned with himself:<BR>
"I spoke in thunders, and my deluge filled<BR>
The marshes that Oj&uacute;mu dried;&#8212;but still<BR>
They fight. Punish, I may&#8212;but what can I<BR>
Achieve? In Heaven omnipotent: but here&#8212;?<BR>
What means it? I cannot tell. . . In the Unknown,<BR>
Beyond the sky where I have set the Sun,<BR>

Is He-Who-Speaks-Not: He knows all. Can this<BR>
Be Truth: Amidst the unnatural strife of brothers<BR>
The World was weaned: by strife must it endure&#8212;?"<BR>
O&iacute;bo, how the first of wars began,<BR>
And Old Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; sought to stay the flow<BR>
Of blood&#8212;your pen has written; but of the days,<BR>
The weary days of all that war, what tongue<BR>
Can tell? 'Tis said the anger of the Gods<BR>
Endured two hundred years: we know the priest<BR>
Os&aacute;nyi made strange amulets for all<BR>
The mortal soldiers of the Gods&#8212;one charm<BR>
Could turn a spear aside, a second robbed<BR>
The wounding sword of all its sting, another<BR>
Made one so terrible that a full score<BR>
Must flee&#8212;but not one word of the great deeds,<BR>
Of hopes and fears, of imminent defeat<BR>
Or victory snatched away is handed down:<BR>
No legend has defied, no voice called through<BR>
The dimness and the baffling years.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD>
<TD align=right>But when</TD></TR>
<TR><TD></TD>
<TD>An end was come to the ill days foreknown<BR>
To Him-Who-Speaks-Not, remembrance of the calm<BR>
Of Heaven stole upon the sleepless Gods&#8212;<BR>

<!------------------------page 32------------------------>

For while the Moon lay soft with all her spell<BR>
On &Iacute;f&egrave; of the many battles; while<BR>
With sorrowful reproach the wise trees stood<BR>
And gazed upon the Gods who made the soil<BR>
The voices of the Forest crooned their dreams<BR>
Of peace: "Sleep, sleep" all weary Nature craved,<BR>
And "Sleep" the slumbrous reed-folk urged, and 'twixt<BR>
The shadow and the silver'd leaf, for sleep</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>&Oacute;gun asks<BR>Od&uacute;wa to<BR>give back<BR>the bag to<BR>Or&iacute;sha.</I></TD>
<TD>The drowsing breezes yearned. . . . And with the dawn<BR>
&Oacute;gun, the warrior, with his comrades stood<BR>
Before the king, and thus he spoke: "Od&uacute;wa,<BR>
We weary of the battle, and its agony<BR>
Weighs heavy on our people. Have you forgot<BR>
The careless hours of Old Ar&aacute;mf&egrave;'s realm?<BR>
What means this war, this empty war between<BR>
One mother's sons? Or&iacute;sha willed it so,<BR>
You say. . . 'Twas said of old 'Who has no house<BR>
Will buy no broom',<A NAME="page_32_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_32_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A> Why then did Great Or&iacute;sha<BR>
Bring plagues on those he made in love? In Heaven<BR>
Afar Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; gave to you the empire,<BR>

<!------------------------page 33------------------------>

<A NAME="page_33"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 33</FONT></A>

And to Or&iacute;sha knowledge of the ways<BR>
Of mysteries and hidden things. The bag<BR>
You seized; but not its clue&#8212;the skill, the wisdom<BR>
Of Great Or&iacute;sha which alone could wake<BR>
The sleeping lore. . . The nations of the World<BR>
Are yours: give back the bag, and Great Or&iacute;sha<BR>
Will trouble us no more." But neither &Oacute;gun<BR>
Nor the soft voices of the night could loose<BR>
Od&uacute;wa from the thrall of envy: the rule<BR>
Of men and empire were of no account<BR>
When the hot thought of Old Ar&aacute;mf&egrave;'s lore<BR>
Roused his black ire anew. The bag he held;<BR>
But all the faithless years had not revealed<BR>
Its promised treasures. Bitterly he answered:</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>Od&uacute;wa<BR>refuses;</I></TD>
<TD>"These many years my brother has made war<BR>
Upon his king; while for the crown, its power<BR>
And greatness, I have wrought unceasing. To-day<BR>
My son&#8212;hope of my cause, my cause itself&#8212;<BR>
Wearies of war, and joins my enemies.<BR>
Weak son, the sceptre you were born to hold<BR>
And hand down strengthened to a line of kings<BR>
Could not uphold your will and be your spur<BR>
Until the end. Is it not said, "Shall one<BR>
Priest bury, and anon his mate dig up<BR>

The corpse?"<A NAME="page_34_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_34_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A> No day's brief work have you undone,<BR>
But all my heart has longed for through a life<BR>
Of labour. So let it be: God of Soft Iron!<BR>
Upon your royal brow descends this day<BR>
The crown of a diminished chieftaincy,<BR>
With the sweet honours of a king in name&#8212;<BR>
For I go back to Old Ar&aacute;mf&egrave;'s hills</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>and trans-<BR>forms to<BR>stone,</I></TD>
<TD>And the calm realm you prate of." Then Odud&uacute;wa<BR>
Transformed to stone and sank beneath the soil,<BR>
Bearing away the fateful bag.<BR></TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>taking the</I></TD>
<TD align=right>And thus,</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>bag with<BR>him.</I></TD>
<TD>Beneath, through all the ages of the World<BR>
A voiceless lore and arts which found no teacher<BR>
Have lain in bondage.</TD></TR>
