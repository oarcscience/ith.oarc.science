<H3 ALIGN="center"><A NAME="I"></A>I. THE CREATION.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationships of the various gods are differently stated by different chiefs and priests of &Iacute;f&egrave;, and also by the same men at different times.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears, however, that Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; ruled in Heaven, and sent his sons, Od&uacute;wa and Or&iacute;sha, to a dark and watery region below to create the world and to people it. According to the legends told in &Iacute;f&egrave;, the gods were not sent away as a punishment; but there is some story of wrong-doing mentioned at &Oacute;wu in the J&eacute;bu country. Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; gave a bag full of arts and wisdom to Or&iacute;sha, and the kingship to Od&uacute;wa.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way from Heaven Od&uacute;wa made Or&iacute;sha drunk, and stole the bag. On reaching the edge of Heaven, Od&uacute;wa hung a chain over the cliff and sent down a priest, called Oj&uacute;mu, with a snail-shell full of magic sand and a "five-fingered" fowl. Oj&uacute;mu threw the sand on the water and the fowl kicked it about. Wherever the fowl kicked the sand, dry land appeared. Thus the whole world was made, with &Iacute;f&egrave; as its centre.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the land was firm, Od&uacute;wa and Or&iacute;sha let themselves down the chain, and were followed by several other gods. Or&iacute;sha began making human beings; but all was dark and cold, because Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; had not sent the sun with Od&uacute;wa. So Od&uacute;wa sent up, and Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; sent the sun, moon and fire. (Fire was sent

<!------------------------page 55------------------------>

<A NAME="page_55"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 55</FONT></A>

on a vulture's head, and that is why the vulture has no feathers on its head.) Then the gods began to teach their arts and crafts to men.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many years Or&iacute;sha made war upon Od&uacute;wa to get back his bag. The various gods took sides, but some looked on. The medicine-men provided amulets for the men on both sides. Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; was angry with his sons for fighting and threw his thunderbolts impartially&#8212;for he was the god of thunder in those days. The war is said to have lasted 201 years, and came to an end only because the gods on Od&uacute;wa's side asked him to give back the bag. Od&uacute;wa, in a huff, transformed to stone and sank beneath the earth, taking the bag with him. His son, &Oacute;gun, the god of iron, then became king.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center"><A NAME="II"></A>II. OD&Uacute;M &#8217;LA, THE FIRST &Oacute;RN&Iacute; OF &Iacute;F&Egrave;</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to tradition, when the gods transformed, they ordered Od&uacute;m&#8217;la to speak for them, to be a father to the whole world and to remain on Earth for ever. In the words of an old chief: "It is our ancient law that the spirit of Od&uacute;m&#8217;la passes from body to body, and will remain for ever on the earth. The spirits of the gods are in their shrines, and Od&uacute;m&#8217;la speaks for them "</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the &Oacute;rn&iacute; claims to be Od&uacute;m&#8217;la himself. This is a matter of dogma, and I express no opinion.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center"><A NAME="III"></A>III. OD&Uacute;WA.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is little to add to the story of Od&uacute;wa told in Parts I, II & III.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ar&aacute;ba told me another version of the end of the War of the Gods: Or&iacute;sha and Od&uacute;wa agreed to stop the fighting on condition that each should have a man for sacrifice every seven months. Fourteen months was then regarded as a year.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another story Ar&aacute;ba told me was: "The Moon is a round crystal stone, which is with Od&uacute;wa. They take it in front when they go to sacrifice to Od&uacute;wa&#8212;otherwise the god would injure the man who offers the sacrifice." Od&uacute;wa is said to have taken the stone from a Moslem, and to have been in the habit of looking at it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I went to Od&uacute;wa's shrine, there was a great knocking of doors to warn the god of my arrival. I did not see the stone.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center"><A NAME="IV"></A>IV. OR&Iacute;SHA AND THE CREATION OF MAN.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legend of Or&iacute;sha's creation of Man is mysterious. He is said to have thrown images into wombs. I was once told he put signs into women's hands. I can only account for this story by the suggestion that it may date from a period when men had not discovered the connection between sexual intercourse and the birth of children.</P>

<P>

<!------------------------page 57------------------------>

<A NAME="page_57"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 57</FONT></A>

</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to spirit life before birth, the priest of Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; said "A child may have been with the spirits, but when he is born he forgets all about it."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifice offered to Or&iacute;sha consists of eight goats, eight fishes, eight rats and eight kola-nuts.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or&iacute;sha was a god of great knowledge (apart from the contents of the bag which was stolen from him), and taught his son, Oluor&oacute;gbo&#8212;who, according to tradition, is the ancestor of the white races.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &Oacute;rn&iacute; attributes ascendancy of Europeans to the up-bringing of Oluor&oacute;gbo.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ancestor has need of eggs, fowls, sheep, kola&#8212;and snails.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center"><A NAME="V"></A>V. OBALUFON.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little is told of Ob&aacute;lufon, the husband of M&oacute;rimi.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a man sent from Heaven by Ar&aacute;mf&egrave;, and was a weaver and a worker in brass. He also showed the people how to tap the palms for palm-wine.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, "he took care of everybody as a mother of a child, and used to go round the town to drive out sickness and evil spirits."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His image represents him as a king.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center"><A NAME="VI"></A>VI. M&Oacute;RIMI.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M&oacute;rimi is the great heroine of the &Iacute;f&egrave; legends. The story of her sacrifice which I have adopted is Ar&aacute;ba's version.</P>

<P>

<!------------------------page 58------------------------>

<A NAME="page_58"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 58</FONT></A>

</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went also to M&oacute;rimi's priest, who showed me her image&#8212;of painted wood and no artistic merit&#8212;representing a naked negress. His story was much the same as Ar&aacute;ba's; but, in his version, M&oacute;rimi sacrificed her only son, Y&eacute;su, for the whole world and not to any god. It would appear that some early Christian missionary had recognised the Virgin Mary in M&oacute;rimi; but it may be doubted whether the missionary had heard of M&oacute;rimi's visit to &Uacute;bo (See Note VII).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center"><A NAME="VII"></A>VII. &Uacute;BO AND THE &Eacute;DI FESTIVAL.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of the &Uacute;bo Wars is that some colonists went from &Iacute;f&egrave; to found a new town which they called &Uacute;bo; but as the gods had given them nothing, they invaded &Iacute;f&egrave;. On the first occasion they were driven back; but the next year they came dressed in grass, terrified the people of &Iacute;f&egrave; and took the men as slaves. (And in those parts of Africa dead kings and gods in need of sacrifice are believed to prefer slaves to free men).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then M&oacute;rimi consulted &Iacute;fa, and was told to sacrifice six goats and six bags of cowries to &Eacute;shu, and go as a harlot to &Uacute;bo. Her mission was successful, and she returned with the necessary information&#8212;only to find the gods had transformed to rivers, stones, etc. (It seems that &Oacute;gun did not transform, as he was afterwards displaced by his son, Or&aacute;nyan).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acting on M&oacute;rimi's advice, Or&aacute;nyan set fire to the &Uacute;bo soldiers on their next inroad.</P>

<P>

<!------------------------page 59------------------------>

<A NAME="page_59"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 59</FONT></A>

</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of &Uacute;bo is commemorated by &Eacute;di (the festival of M&oacute;rimi, which began on the 21st November in 1913). Men dressed in hay parade the town, but have to run for their lives when others pursue them with fire. Fire is also taken out to the Bush.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first day of &Eacute;di, the &Oacute;rn&iacute; appears, but must remain in the Afin (Palace) for the remaining seven. During this period the women do honour to M&oacute;rimi's share in the victory by emulating her deed, and their husbands are not allowed to interfere.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of the legend is doubtful. There may have been such a town as &Uacute;bo, but it seems likely that the Festival is connected with agriculture.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&Uacute;bo (or &Iacute;gbo) means the Bush, and M&oacute;rimi may have advised the customary burning of the Bush to prepare the land for crops. The date of the Festival (early in the dry season), the fire and the men dressed in hay, all suggest this interpretation. On the other hand, the same arguments, combined with the seclusion of the &Oacute;rn&iacute; and the license of the women, would favour the view that &Eacute;di was the more general Festival of the Saturnalia. Possibly it was so originally; and the demons to be driven out appeared so material in the form of tropical vegetation that &Uacute;bo (the Bush to be burned) has obscured the former meaning of the Festival. If this be so, M&oacute;rimi's mission to &Uacute;bo may be a later fable to account for the license of the women before farming operations begin.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center"><A NAME="VIII"></A>VIII. OSHUN.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&Oacute;shun was a woman (or goddess) in high favour with both Od&uacute;wa and Or&iacute;sha. "It were well were &Oacute;shun with us," said Od&uacute;wa, and Or&iacute;sha agreed. Accordingly she took her place on Od&uacute;wa's left, Or&iacute;sha being on his right; that is to say &Oacute;shun was considered the third personage in &Iacute;f&egrave;.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second chief in &Iacute;f&egrave;, the Obal&uacute;fe, claims descent from &Oacute;shun for himself and half the people of his quarter of the town. He has a well in his compound, called &Oacute;shun, which is said to be the actual water into which &Oacute;shun transformed herself. He says his first forefather took a calabash of the water with him when he went to war, and this gallon became the source of the River. The source is forty miles from &Iacute;f&egrave;, and perhaps the Obal&uacute;fe is right. The well is never dry; and it is needless to add that the water has many curative properties. One would be surprised if a descendant of &Oacute;shun died, except from other causes.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the time of the &Oacute;shun Festival," says Obal&uacute;fe, "all her tribe collect sheep, goats, yams, agidi, palm-wine, kola, rats, fish and pigeons, and bring them to me for the feast. &Oacute;shun gets the blood of goats, sheep and pigeons, the head of a rat&#8212;but not of a fish. We eat the fish&#8212;although they are the children of &Oacute;shun and consequently our brothers." &Oacute;shun is more strait-laced than her descendants.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center"><A NAME="IX"></A>IX. OL&Oacute;KUN</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a pond in &Iacute;f&egrave; called &Oacute;kun (the Ocean), where Ol&oacute;kun transformed to water. Thence she flowed underground, and came out in the sea.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her priest showed me a bronze head of Ol&oacute;kun, which has considerable merit. He told me that, in return for sacrifice, Ol&oacute;kun gives beads. In Benin, Ol&oacute;kun is considered to be the Goddess of Wealth as well as of the Sea; and a King of Benin, who must have been alive about 1400 A.D., is said to have found the treasures of Ol&oacute;kun laid out on the shore and to have looted her coral.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center"><A NAME="X"></A>X. OGUN AND ORANYAN</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&Oacute;gun was the son of Od&uacute;wa, and is usually regarded as the God of Iron and of War.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his chief-priest (the Osh&oacute;gun), he went away to war and captured a woman called Desh&oacute;ju, whom he made his wife. When &Oacute;gun returned to &Iacute;f&egrave;, Od&uacute;wa took Desh&oacute;ju from his son. There is therefore some doubt as to whether &Oacute;gun was the father of Or&aacute;nyan&#8212;who was born with a leg, an arm and half his body black, the remainder being white (according to the Osh&oacute;gun).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&Oacute;gun may have had other attributes. He may have been a Phallic Deity, because there are hewn stones in &Iacute;f&egrave;, called the staves of &Oacute;gun, which appear

<!------------------------page 62------------------------>

<A NAME="page_62"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 62</FONT></A>

to be of Phallic origin. It is also noteworthy that, at the time of his Festival, &Oacute;gun is said to kill any marriageable girl he may find in her mother's house. (This happened once to Ar&aacute;ba; the prospective son-in-law could not produce &pound;5, and Ar&aacute;ba, who gives no credit, lost a potential five pound note in the shape of his daughter). Further, when a child is circumcised the severed skin is put in a calabash of &Oacute;gun "to worship him (together with a snail in order that the wound may heal)."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&Oacute;gun may also have been the Sun-God (or a worshipper of the Sun-God). His festival is commonly called Ol&oacute;jjor (Lord of Day). Oshogun says &Oacute;gun was Ol&oacute;jjor; Ar&aacute;ba says Ol&oacute;jjor was someone else, the confusion being due to the circumstance that the two festivals take place at the same time. In this connection, the half-and-half colouring of Or&aacute;nyan is suggestive.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dog is the principal animal used for sacrifice to &Oacute;gun. Or&aacute;nyan prefers a ram, a rat, kola and much palm-wine.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, Or&aacute;nyan displaced his father, who planted his staves in &Iacute;f&egrave; and went away. I have presumed the death of Os&aacute;nyi, as I cannot otherwise explain the fact that &Oacute;gun "went away" instead of transforming as the other gods had done. In his turn, Or&aacute;nyan "went away: he had too much medicine to die."</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center"><A NAME="XI"></A>XI. THE CULT OF PEREG&Uacute;N &#8217;GBO.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pereg&uacute;n &#8217;Gbo (or Pereg&uacute;n &Iacute;gbo) seems to have been a god who caused the forest to bring forth birds and beasts. He was a son of God, and came to earth with Ebbor (worship) and &Eacute;di, a god who causes men to do what they know to be wrong.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is evident from the incantation below that Pereg&uacute;n &#8217;Gbo was originally approached by people in need of children, but nowadays the same formula is recited by the priest whatever a man may be asking for. The priest tells the man to bring a sheep, kola, palm-oil, a pigeon, a cock, and a hen; also a live goat for the priest.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest kills the sheep, pigeon, cock and hen. The three birds and a part of the sheep are placed in separate broken pots with palm-oil. The man is then told to produce nine pennyworth of kowries, which are also put in the pots. The priest takes the balance of the mutton in addition to the live goat. The priest then faces the pots, puts pepper (&aacute;tar&egrave;) into his mouth, and recites the incantation:&#8212;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the priest has finished the recitation, the man takes the pots to the shrine of &Eacute;shu (the Devil).

(The incantation is apparently in some form of archaic Yoruba, and the Babal&aacute;wo had to explain much of it to the interpreter. Some of the translations are probably very loose).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center"><A NAME="XII"></A>XII. THE DIVINATION OF &Iacute;FA (A FRAGMENT)</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&Iacute;fa was the Messenger of the Gods, and is consulted by the Yoruba on all subjects.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His priests (called Babal&aacute;wo) profit considerably by divination, which they perform with sand on a circular board, or with a charm called Okp&eacute;ll&egrave;.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okp&eacute;ll&egrave; consists of eight pieces of bark on a string. These eight are arranged in fours.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the pieces of bark may fall either with the outside or the inside showing. Consequently

<!------------------------page 64------------------------>

<A NAME="page_64"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 64</FONT></A>

each set of four may fall in sixteen different ways having different names and meanings.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are called the Sixteen Messengers of &Iacute;fa.</P>

</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chance, however, of the four on the Babal&aacute;wo's left agreeing with that on his right is only one in sixteen. The other fifteen combinations which may appear with Ogbe on the right are called: Ogbe Yeku, Ogbe Wori, Ogbe Di, &amp;c., similarly with the other Messengers of &Iacute;fa. These combinations are called the children of the Messenger who appears on the right. Thus, Ogbe Yeku is a child of Ogbe; Oyeku Logbe is a child of Oyeku.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this it will be seen that Okp&eacute;ll&egrave; can show 256 combinations.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Procedure</I>.&#8212;A man comes to a Babal&aacute;wo to consult &Iacute;fa. He places a gift of cowries (to which he has whispered his needs) before the Babal&aacute;wo. The latter takes Okp&eacute;ll&egrave; and places it on the cowries. He then says: "You, Okp&eacute;ll&egrave;, know what this man said to the cowries. Now tell me." Then he lifts Okp&eacute;ll&egrave; and lays it out on the floor. From the messenger or child which appears the Babal&aacute;wo is supposed to deduce that his client wants a son, has stolen a goat, or has a toothache, as the case may be. He then tells him what he must bring as a sacrifice to achieve his ends. In all cases the sacrifice (or a large part of it) is offered to &Eacute;shu (the devil) for fear that he might undo the good work. For instance, the client is poor and needs money: &Eacute;di M&eacute;ji appears, and the Babal&aacute;wo tells his client to bring a dog, a fowl, and some cowries and palm-oil. The man splits the dog and the fowl; puts palm-oil and

<!------------------------page 68------------------------>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing the incantation, the priest takes some of the pepper from his tongue and puts in on the patient's head. The patient recovers, and is able to take nourishment at once.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center"><A NAME="XIV"></A>XIV. AJ&Iacute;JA (THE DUST-DEVIL).</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aj&iacute;ja was a doctor who lived with Ar&aacute;mf&egrave;, and came to earth with another doctor. They made various medicines&#8212;one to kill a man when asked to do so. He pronounced certain words, and the man died. He could also kill with his walking-stick. He lives on &Oacute;ke Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; (&Oacute;ke &Oacute;ra), and can only be approached through Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; (the father of the gods), because he is a bad man. He is worshipped near Ar&aacute;mf&egrave;'s shrine.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When he wishes to make trouble, he comes through the town. He sometimes sets fire to a house by picking the fire up and putting it on the thatch.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"When a man meets Aj&iacute;ja, he should protect himself by putting pepper in his mouth and saying: "Ahanr&iacute;yen, F&aacute;gada Shaomi" (names of Aj&iacute;ja), "ki &iacute;ru re b&oacute;mi" (put your tail in water). The man should then spit the pepper at Aj&iacute;ja.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sometimes Aj&iacute;ja turns into a big lizard."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to another story, Aj&iacute;ja is a devil with one leg who throws men down and breaks their ankles.</P>
