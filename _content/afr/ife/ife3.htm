<TD><I>The &Oacute;rn&iacute; of &Iacute;f&egrave; speaks:</I><BR>
O&iacute;bo, you have asked to hear our lore,<BR>
The legends of the World's young hours&#8212;and where<BR>
Could truth in greater surety have its home<BR>
Than in the precincts of the shrines of Those<BR>
Who made the World, and in the mouths of priests<BR>
To whom their doings have been handed down<BR>
From sire to son?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>Ar&aacute;mf&egrave;<BR>reigns in<BR>Heaven;</I></TD>
<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this World was made<BR>
There reigned Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; in the realm of Heaven<BR>
Amidst his sons. Old were the hills around him;<BR>
The Sun had shone upon his vines and cornfields<BR>
Since time past reckoning. Old was Ar&aacute;mf&egrave;,<BR>
The father of the Gods: his youth had been<BR>
The youth of Heaven. . . Once when the King reclined<BR>
Upon the dais, and his sons lay prostrate<BR>
In veneration at his feet, he spoke</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>tells his<BR>sons of the<BR>creation of<BR>Heaven;</I></TD>
<TD>Of the great things he purposed:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My sons, you know<BR>
But fair things which I made for you, before<BR>
I called your spirits from the Dusk: for always<BR>

Your eyes have watched the shadows and the wind<BR>
On waving corn, and I have given you<BR>
The dances and the chorus of the night&#8212;<BR>
An age of mirth and sunrise (the wine of Heaven)<BR>
Is your existence. You have not even heard<BR>
Of the grey hour when my young eyes first opened<BR>
To gaze upon a herbless Mass, unshaped<BR>
And unadorned. But I knew well the heart<BR>
Of Him-Who-Speaks-Not, the far-felt Purpose that gave<BR>
Me birth; I laboured and the grim years passed:<BR>
Streams flowed along their sunny beds; I set<BR>
The stars above me, and the hills about;<BR>
I fostered budding trees, and taught the birds<BR>
Their song&#8212;the unshapely I had formed to beauty,<BR>
And as the ages came I loved to make<BR>
The beautiful more fair. . . All went not well:<BR>
A noble animal my mind conceived<BR>
Emerged in loathsome form to prey upon<BR>
My gentle creatures; a river, born to bask<BR>
In sunlit channels and mirror the steep hills,<BR>
Tore down its banks and ravaged field and plain;<BR>
While cataract and jagged precipice,<BR>
Now grand with years, remind me of dread days<BR>

<!------------------------page 15------------------------>

When Heaven tottered, and wide rifts sundered my young<BR>
Fair hills, and all seemed lost. Yet&#8212;I prevailed.<BR>
Think, now, if the accomplished whole be Heaven,<BR>
How wonderful the anxious years of slow<BR>
And hazardous achievement&#8212;a destiny<BR>
For Gods. But yours it has not been to lead<BR>
Creation by the cliff's-edge way from Mass<BR>
To Paradise." He paused on the remembrance,<BR>
And Great Or&iacute;sha cried: "Can we do naught?<BR>
What use in godhead without deeds to do?<BR>
Where yearns a helpless region for a hand<BR>
To guide it?" And Old Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; answered him:</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>sends them<BR>to make the<BR>World.</I></TD>
<TD>"My son, your day approaches. Far-off, the haze<BR>
Rests always on the outer waste which skirts<BR>
Our realm; beyond, a nerveless Mass lies cold<BR>
'Neath floods which some malign unreason heaves.<BR>
Od&uacute;wa, first-born of my sons, to you I give<BR>
The five-clawed Bird, the sand of power.<A NAME="page_15_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_15_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A> Go now,<BR>
Call a despairing land to smiling life<BR>
Above the jealous sea, and found sure homesteads<BR>
For a new race whose destiny is not<BR>
The eternal life of Gods. You are their judge;<BR>

<!------------------------page 16------------------------>

<A NAME="page_16"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 16</FONT></A>

Yours is the kingship, and to you all Gods<BR>
And men are subject. Wisest of my sons,<BR>
Or&iacute;sha, yours is the grateful task to loose<BR>
Vague spirits<A NAME="page_16_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_16_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A> waiting for the Dawn&#8212;to make<BR>
The race that shall be; and to you I give<BR>
This bag of Wisdom's guarded lore and arts<BR>
For Man's well-being and advancement. And you,<BR>
My younger sons, the chorus and the dance,<BR>
The voice of worship and the crafts are yours<BR>
To teach&#8212;that the new thankful race may know<BR>
The mirth of Heaven and the joys of labour."<BR>
Then Od&uacute;wa said: "Happy our life has been,<BR>
And I would gladly roam these hills for ever,<BR>
Your son and servant. But to your command<BR>
I yield; and in my kingship pride o'ersteps<BR>
Sorrow and heaviness. Yet, Lord Ar&aacute;mf&egrave;,<BR>
I am your first-born: wherefore do you give<BR>
The arts and wisdom to Or&iacute;sha? I,<BR>
The King, will be obeyed; the hearts of men<BR>
Will turn in wonder to the God who spells<BR>
Strange benefits." But Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; said "Enough;<BR>
To each is fitting task is given. Farewell."</TD></TR>

Here the Beginning was: from Ar&aacute;mf&egrave;'s vales<BR>
Through the desert regions the exiled Gods approached<BR>
The edge of Heaven, and into blackness plunged&#8212;<BR>
A sunless void o'er godless water lying&#8212;<A NAME="page_17_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_17_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A><BR>
To seize an empire from the Dark, and win<BR>
Amidst ungoverned waves a sovereignty.<BR>
&nbsp;</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>Od&uacute;wa<BR>steals the<BR>bag and<BR>causes War<BR>on Earth.</I></TD>
<TD>But by the roadside while Or&iacute;sha slept<BR>
Od&uacute;wa came by stealth and bore away<BR>
The bag Ar&aacute;mf&egrave; gave. Thus was the will<BR>
Of God undone: for thus with the charmed sand<BR>
Cast wide on the unmastered sea, his sons<BR>
Called forth a World of envy and of war.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Of Man's Creation, and of the restraint<BR>
Ol&oacute;kun<A NAME="page_17_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_17_note_2"><FONT size=1>2</FONT></A> placed upon the chafing sea,<BR>
Of the unconscious years which passed in darkness<BR>
Till dazzling sunshine touched the unused eyes<BR>
Of men, of War and magic&#8212;my priest shall tell you,<BR>
And all the Great Ones did before the day<BR>
They vanished to return to the calm hills</TD></TR>

Of Old Ar&aacute;mf&egrave;'s realm . . . They went away;<BR>
But still with us their altars and their priests<BR>
Remain, and from their shrines the hidden Gods<BR>
Peer forth with joy to watch the dance they taught,<BR>
And hear each night their chorus with the drum:<BR>
For changeless here the early World endures<BR>
In this first stronghold of humanity,<BR>
And, constant as the buffets of the waves<BR>
Of Queen Ol&oacute;kun on the shore, the song,<BR>
The dance of those old Gods abide, the mirth,<BR>
The life . . . I, too, am born of the Beginning:</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign=top><I>Od&uacute;m&#8217;la<BR>speaks for<BR>the Gods;</I></TD>

To be a father to a mourning people,<BR>
To tend the shrines and utter solemn words<BR>
Inspired by Those invisible. And when<BR>
Od&uacute;m&#8217;la's time had come to yield the crown,<BR>
To wait upon the River's brink,<A NAME="page_18_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_18_note_2"><FONT size=1>2</FONT></A> and cross<BR>
To Old Ar&aacute;mf&egrave;&#8212;&Iacute;fa,<A NAME="page_18_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_18_note_3"><FONT size=1>3</FONT></A> in his wisdom,</TD></TR>

Proclaimed that son with whom Od&uacute;m&#8217;la's soul<BR>
Abode. Thus has it ever been; and now<BR>
With me that Being is&#8212;about, within&#8212;<BR>
And on our sacred days these lips pronounce<BR>
The words of Odud&uacute;wa and Or&iacute;sha.</TD></TR>
