### 15. CONCERNING ISAAC AND JACOB

And Isaac his son became king, and he did not transgress the commandment
of God; and he was pure in his soul and in his body, and he died in
honour. And his son Jacob reigned, and he also did not transgress the
commandment of God, and his possessions became numerous, and his
children were many; and God blessed him and he died in honour.
