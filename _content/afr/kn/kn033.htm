<p>And she arrived in Jerusalem, and brought to the King very many precious gifts which he desired to possess greatly. And he paid her great honour and rejoiced, and he gave her a habitation in the royal palace near him. And he sent her food both for the morning and evening meal, each time fifteen measures by the <i>&#7731;&ocirc;r&icirc;</i> of finely ground white meal, cooked with oil and gravy and sauce in abundance, and thirty measures by the <i>&#7731;&ocirc;r&icirc;</i> of crushed white meal wherefrom bread for three hundred and fifty people was made, with the necessary platters and trays, and ten stalled oxen, and five bulls, and fifty sheep, without (counting) the kids, and deer, and gazelles and fatted fowls, and a vessel of wine containing sixty <i>gerr&acirc;t</i> measures, and thirty measures of old wine, and twenty-five singing men and twenty-five singing</p>
