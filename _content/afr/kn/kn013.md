### 5. CONCERNING THE KINGDOM OF SETH

And Adam died, and Seth reigned in righteousness. And Seth died, and
Hênôs (Enos) reigned. And Hênôs (Enos) died, and Ḳâynân (Cainan)
reigned. And Ḳâynân (Cainan) died, and Malâl’êl (Mahalaleel) reigned.
And Malâl’êl (Mahalaleel) died, and Yârôd (Jared) reigned. And Yârôd
died, and Hênôkh (Enoch) reigned in righteousness, and he feared God,
and \[God\] hid him so that he might not see death. And he became a king
in his flesh in the Land of the Living. And after Enoch disappeared
Mâtûsâlâ (Methuselah) reigned. And Mâtûsâlâ died, and Lâmêkh (Lamech)
reigned. And Lâmêkh died, and Nôḥ (Noah) reigned in righteousness, and
he pleased God in all his works.
