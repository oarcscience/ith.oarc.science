### 18. HOW THE ORTHODOX FATHERS AND BISHOPS AGREED

And again the Council of the Three Hundred and Eighteen answered and
said, "Amen. This is the salvation of the children of Adam. For since
the Tabernacle of the Law of God hath come down, they shall be called,
'Men of the house of God,' even as David saith, 'And His habitation is
in Zion.' <span id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_47) And again he saith by the
mouth of the Holy Ghost, 'And My habitation is here, for I have chosen
it. And I will bless her priests, and I will make her poor to be glad.
And unto David

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

will I give seed in her, and upon the earth one who shall become king,
and moreover, in the heavens one from his seed shall reign in the flesh
upon the throne of the Godhead. And as for his enemies they shall be
gathered together under his footstool, and they shall be sealed with his
seal.'"
