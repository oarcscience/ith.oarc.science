<p>And now hearken how each one of them hath prophesied concerning Him, [for the narrative] is pleasant to hear. Isaiah the Prophet prophesied concerning His coming and said, "A Son is born unto us. A Child is given unto us. Dominion is written upon His shoulder. He is God, strong in rule, King, great Counsellor is His name."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_182"></A><A HREF="#fn_182"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Now the meaning of this is manifest: the Son of God is born, Whose sovereignty was written down before the world was, and He is wiser than anyone else: [this is what] he saith unto thee. And again Isaiah prophesied and said, "Behold My servant Whom I have chosen, on Whom is the delight of My soul, and the nations shall put their confidence in Him."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_183"></A><A HREF="#fn_183"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> And these words give us to understand that Christ is the Spirit of God, the Word of the Father Who put on our flesh and was born for us: and the peoples of R&ocirc;m&ecirc; and Ethiopia and all other nations have believed in Him. And he spake unto the people of Israel, and again he prophesied, saying, "Many shall follow after Thee with their loins girded up, and their backs bound with fetters, and they shall pray to Thee and worship Thee, for thou art God, and we have not recognized Thee."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_184"></A><A HREF="#fn_184"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Now this he spake concerning the martyrs, and those who became monks in the desert and solitary monks, whose hearts were fettered with His commandment, and who prayed to Him, meaning that reward was meet for both the martyrs and the solitary monks. "And we did not recognize Thee": Israel made itself blind, and crucified Him, and refused to walk in His righteousness. And again Isaiah prophesied and said, "God shall come, and the heathen shall put their trust in Him and shall know Him;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_185"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> this meaneth that Christ shall come, and the Jews shall reject Him, but the heathen shall believe</p>

<p>in Him. And again he prophesied and said, "Be strong ye weak hands and tired knees, and rejoice ye hearts that are cast down, for God hath come, Who shall requite our debt, and save us. And He shall open the eyes of the blind, and He shall make the ears of the deaf to hear, and the feet that are lame shall run, and the tongues of the dumb shall speak."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_186"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> These words are spoken in respect of those who err in worshipping idols, and those who are dead in sin, and those whose hearts are darkened, and of you who do not know that God created you. Rejoice ye this day: He hath come Who will redeem the sin of Adam, and make Adam's debt His own. He was crucified being sinless. He hath killed Death by means of His own death, and the blind see, and the lame walk, and the deaf hear, and the dumb speak unhaltingly, and besides all these things the dead are raised. This is the meaning of this prophecy.</p>  
<p>Thus David the Prophet prophesied and said, "God shall come in visible form, and our God will not keep silence."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_187"></A><A HREF="#fn_187"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

<p>Thus David prophesied and said, "Blessed is He Who cometh in the name of God: we have blessed you in the Name of the Lord."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_190"></A><A HREF="#fn_190"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Thus Habakkuk prophesied and said, "God shall come from the South, and the Holy One from Mount F&acirc;r&acirc;n and from the cities of Judah."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_191"></A><A HREF="#fn_191"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>

For I have given water in the desert, and made streams of water to flow in the wilderness, so that I may give drink to My people and to My chosen ones whom I have gotten, so that they may declare My glory, and perform My commandment."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_231"></A><A HREF="#fn_231"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>

<p>Thus Micah the Prophet prophesied and said unto the Jews, "I have no pleasure in you, saith God Who ruleth all things.

<p>And again Micah the Prophet said, "A new covenant shall appear upon the mountain of God, and it shall be prepared upon the tops of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills, and people shall say, 'Come ye, let us go up into the mountain of God.'

<p>Thus Moses the Prophet prophesied and said concerning the Trinity, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is One."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_236"></A><A HREF="#fn_236"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> And this is to be explained thus Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit are One God, Whose kingdom is one, Whose dominion is one, and as One men shall worship Them in the heavens and in the earth, in the sea and in the abysses. And to Him be praise for ever and ever! Amen.</p>
