### 12. CONCERNING CANAAN <span id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_37)

Now, it was Canaan who rent the kingdom from the children of Shem, and
he transgressed the oath which his father Noah had made them to swear.
And the sons of Canaan were seven mighty men, and he took seven mighty
cities from the land of Shem, and set his sons over them; and likewise
he also made his own portion double. And in later days God took
vengeance upon the sons of Canaan, and made the sons of Shem to inherit
their country. These are the nations whom they inherited: the
Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the
Jebusites, and

the Girgasites; these are they whom Canaan seized by force from the seed
of Shem. For it was not right for him to invade \[his\] kingdom, and to
falsify the oath, and because of this they ceased to be, and their
memorial perished, through transgressing \[God's\] command, and
worshipping idols, and bowing down to those who were not gods.

And after the death of Shem Arphaxad reigned, and after the death of
Arphaxad Ḳâynân <span id="fr_38"></span>[1](#fn_38) (Cainan) reigned,
and after the death of Ḳâynân Sâlâ (Salah) reigned, and after him Eber
reigned, and after him Pâlêḳ (Peleg) reigned, and after him Râgâw (Reu)
reigned, and after him Sêrôḥ (Serug) reigned, and after him Nakhôr
(Nahor) reigned, and after him Târâ (Terah) reigned. And these are they
who made magical images, and they went to the tombs of their fathers and
made an image (or, picture) of gold, and silver, and brass, and a devil
used to hold converse with them out of each of the images of their
fathers, and say unto them, "O my son So-and-so, offer up unto me as a
sacrifice the son whom thou lovest." And they slaughtered their sons and
their daughters to the devils, and they poured out innocent blood to
filthy devils.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_37"></span>[8:1](kn020.htm#fr_37) The son of Ham (Genesis
x, 6).

<span id="fn_38"></span>[9:1](kn020.htm#fr_38) There is some confusion
here; Cainan was the son of Enos (Gen. 9).
