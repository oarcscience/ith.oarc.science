<p>COCK, it is said, was once overtaken by Jackal, and caught. Cock said to Jackal, "Please, pray first (before you kill me), as the white man does."</p> 
<p>Jackal asked, "In what manner does he pray? Tell me."</p> 
<p>"He folds his bands in praying," said Cock. Jackal folded his hands and prayed. Then Cock spoke again: "You ought not to look about you as you do. You had better shut your eyes." He did so; and Cock flew away, upbraiding at the same time Jackal with these words, "You rogue! do you also pray? "</p> 
<p>There sat Jackal, speechless, because he had been outdone.</p>
