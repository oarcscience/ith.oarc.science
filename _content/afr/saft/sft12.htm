<p>THE birds wanted a king. Men have a king, so have animals, and why shouldn't they? All had assembled.</p> 
<p>"The Ostrich, because he is the largest," one called out.</p> 
<p>"No, he can't fly."</p> 
<p>"Eagle, on account of his strength."</p> 
<p>"Not he, he is too ugly."</p> 
<p>"Vulture, because he can fly the highest."</p> 
<p>"No, Vulture is too dirty, his odor is terrible."</p> 
<p>"Peacock, he is so beautiful."</p> 
<p>"His feet are too ugly, and also his voice."</p> 
<p>"Owl, because he can see well."</p> 
<p>"Not Owl, he is ashamed of the light."</p> 
<p>And so they got no further. Then one shouted aloud, "He who can fly the highest will be king." "Yes, yes," they all screamed, and at a given Signal they all ascended straight up into the sky.</p> 
<p>Vulture flew for three whole days without stopping, straight toward the sun. Then he cried aloud, "I am the highest, I am king."</p> 
<p>"T-sie, t-sie, t-sie," he heard above him. There Tink-tinkje was flying. He had held fast to one of the great wing feathers of Vulture, and had never been felt, he was so light. "T-sie, t-sie, t-sle, I am the highest, I am king," piped Tink-tinkje.</p> 
<p>Vulture flew for another day still ascending. "I am highest, I am king."</p> 
<p>"T-sie, t-sie, t-sie, I am the highest, I am king," Tink-tinkje mocked. There he was again, having crept out from under the wing of Vulture.</p> 
<p>Vulture flew on the fifth day straight up in the air. "I am the highest, I am king," he called.</p> 
<p>"T-sie, t-sie, t-sie," piped the little fellow above him. "I am the highest, I am king."</p> 
<p>Vulture was tired and now flew direct to earth. The other birds were mad through and through. Tink-tinkje must die because he had taken advantage of Vulture's feathers and there hidden himself. All flew after him and he had to take refuge in a mouse hole. But how were they to get him out? Some one must stand guard to seize him the moment he put out his head.</p> 
<p>"Owl must keep guard; he has the largest eyes; he can see well," they exclaimed.</p> 
<p>Owl went and took up his position before the hole. The sun was warm and soon Owl became sleepy and presently he was fast asleep.</p> 
<p>Tink-tinkje peeped, saw that Owl was asleep, and z-zip away he went. Shortly afterwards the other birds came to see if Tink-tinkje were still in the hole. "T-sie, t-sie," they heard in a tree; and there the little vagabond was sitting.</p> 
<p>White-crow, perfectly disgusted, turned around and exclaimed, "Now I won't say a single word more." And from that day to this Whitecrow has never spoken. Even though you strike him, he makes no sound, he utters no cry.</p>
