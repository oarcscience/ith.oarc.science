<p>GIRAFFE and Tortoise, they say, met one day. Giraffe said to Tortoise, "At once I could trample you to death." Tortoise, being afraid, remained silent. Then Giraffe said, "At once I could swallow you." Tortoise said, in answer to this, " Well, I just belong to the family of those whom it has always been customary to swallow." Then Giraffe swallowed Tortoise; but when the latter was being gulped down, he stuck in Giraffe's throat, and as the latter could not get it down, he was choked to death.</p> 
<p>When Giraffe was dead, Tortoise crawled out and went to Crab (who is considered as the mother of Tortoise), and told her what had happened. Then Crab said:</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p><dir> <dir>  
<p>"The little Crab! I could sprinkle it under its arm with Boochoo,[1]<br> The crooked-legged little one, I could sprinkle under its arm."</p></dir> </dir>  
<p>Tortoise answered its mother and said:</p><dir> <dir>  
<p>Have you not always sprinkled me,<br> That you want to sprinkle me now?</p></dir> </dir>  
<p>Then they went and fed for a whole year on the remains of Giraffe.</p>
