*NOTE:* 

### 10. Eating Tiger's Guts.

The "Just so" story, number 51, is another version of the diving plot,
which is popular in Jamaica. Jekyll tells it, 7-9, in form (b).

Compare: Chatelain, 205; Junod, 208; Renel, 254; JAFL 32:395; Nights,
373-377; Parsons, Sea Islands, 40.

In all these cases, the trickster proposes diving and eats a store of
food while his companion is in the water. The grotesque idea of bodily
dismemberment coupled with the diving episode, I do not find in any of
the parallels noted. In Parsons, Andros Island, 73, Boukee and Elephant
go out bird-hunting. Boukee shoots Elephant and brings him home to the
family. Boukee is brought to justice because the children are overheard
singing,

"Me an' Mamma'n Pappa  
Eat my belly full o' pot o' soup  
Bo'o' Elephin got (gut), oh!"

For the incriminating song in version (b), see number 4.
