*NOTE:* 

### 78. The Fish Lover.

This story is very common in Jamaica. See Milne-Home, 91-93, and compare
Renel 1:203-204; 206-208 (origin of water-beings); Renel 2:268-269;
Parsons, Andros Island, 61, and note for references; Sea Islands, 137.

{p. 268}

In Smith, 573-584, a young man changes into a fish in order to escape
the attentions of the ladies. He comes out when his mother calls him. He
is finally lured out and caught in the meshes of his lover's hair.

In Grimm 8, Bolte u. Polívka 1:69--70, a little girl is forced by her
brothers to go out and cut peat with a dull knife. Her elf-lover
stretches out a sharp knife to her from the hill where he lives and
tells her to call him by striking on the stone. The brothers wonder how
she can cut the peat, and spy upon her. They strike the stone, take the
knife and cut off the elf's hand, who thereafter disappears.
