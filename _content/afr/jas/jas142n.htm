<P>The songs of this medley at first follow the story of Goat's escape from the dance, number 40, combined with the parallel story of Pat's escape from Puss's dance. The song is taken from a popular game in which one player represents the cat, another the rat; all the others form a line with clasped hands, and Puss tries to catch Rat through the line, while all sing the song. The bull's song belongs to number 88 or 89. Anansi's fifing is possibly taken from 139.</P>
