*NOTE:* 

### 14. New Names.

The trick to save a mother in time of famine from a mutual agreement of
sacrifice to hunger, has a great vogue in Jamaica. I got two versions,
and Pamela Smith tells it as "Parrot, Tiger and Anancy," 52-54.

Compare: Dayrell, 86-90; Dennett, 85; Harris, Nights, 233-236; 237-241;
Fortier, 109; Parsons, Andros Island, 116-117; JAFL 30:230-231.

Only in the Jamaica versions and in Parsons does the trick consist in
teaching a hidden name. In P. Smith, after saving his mother by teaching
her the new name, Anansi hides her in a tree and the story follows 17a.
Dayrell, and Harris 237-241, tell the tree story. In Dennet, she is
hidden in a cave, where she is discovered by treachery and killed. In
Harris 233-236, Wolf's mother is taken first to market and sold, and
Rabbit tricks Wolf out of horses, wagon and provisions by the familiar
device of burying the tails; but the story is incomplete, as it does not
explain how Anansi got out of the bargain. In Fortier, the two mothers
are tied, one with a rope, the other with a cob-web, and one mother
escapes. The tying trick precedes the tail-burying in Parson's
Portuguese version, JAFL 30:230-231.

In Chatelain, 141-145, four brothers-in-law refuse food to their
brother's wife because she does not know their names. A bird sings them
to her as follows:

    Listen, I will tell thee;  
(One is) Tumba Sekundu;  
(One Is) Tumba Sekundu Muna;  
(One is) Tumba Kaulu;  
(One is) Tumba Kaulu Muna.

For the hidden name theme which forms the basis of this story, see note
to number 69.
