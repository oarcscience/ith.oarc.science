<CENTER><I>NOTE:</I>&nbsp;</CENTER><H3 ALIGN="CENTER">4. Tiger's Sheep-skin Suit.</H3>
<P>Parkes heard this story in St. Ann Parish. Wona, 62-67, tells how Anansi steals Monkey's clothes and passes the theft off on "Bone."</P>
<P>Compare: Tremearne, FL 21:352; Harris, Nights; 68-74; Parsons, Sea Islands, 145: JAFL 32:366.</P>
<P>The common theme of teaching to an unsuspecting comrade an incriminating song (as in Parsons, Sea Islands, 145) is here emphasized by a second intrigue, that of the sheep-skin suit. The idea seems related to the next number. In Wona, 30-36, Tacoomah puts on a sheep-skin and bides in the fold from which the sheep are being stolen, Anansi ties and accuses him because he wears the sheep-skin.</P>
