</I><P>It was mother and two daughters. One of the daughters go to river-side worship a little fish. She commence to sing and the fish will come up to her,</P><DIR>
<DIR>

Fish, fish, fish, fish, pen-ge leng, Come on the ri-ver, come pen-ge leng.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</FONT><P>So the little fish come to her and she play&nbsp;play&nbsp;play, let go the fish and the fish go back in the river.</P>
<P>An' when she go back home, her mother quarrel, say she wait back so long. Next day, wouldn't send her back to river, send the other daughter. So when the other daughter went, she sung the same song she hear her sister sing,--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>"Fish&nbsp;fish&nbsp;fish&nbsp;fish, pengeleng,<BR>
Come on the river, pengeleng."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</FONT><P>She catch the fisch, bring it home, they cook the fish for dinner and save some for the other daughter. When she came, she didn't eat it for she knew it was the said fish. She begin to sing,</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</I><P>A man and a woman had but one daughter was their pet. The girl was engaged to a fish, to another young man too. She generally at ten o'clock cook breakfas' for the both. That man at home eat, then she took a waiter wid the fish breakfas' to the river. When she go to the river, she had to sing a song that the fish might come out,--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>"Dear old Juna, dear old Juna,<BR>
Oona a da vina sa,<BR>
Oona&nbsp;oona&nbsp;oona&nbsp;oona,<BR>

<P>{p. 92}</P>
<P>Go on for several days, every day she sing the same; the fish give her the same reply. The young man thought of it now. One morning, he went a little earlier wid his gun, sing the same tune. The fish come out, sing the same tune as it generally do. The young man shot it, carry the fish home, dressed it, everybody eat now, gal an' ev'rybody. At the end of the eating, she found out it was the said fish. She dropped dead at the instant.</P>
