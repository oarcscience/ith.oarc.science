------------------------------------------------------------------------

*NOTE:* 

### 142. Anansi makes a Dance.

The songs of this medley at first follow the story of Goat's escape from
the dance, number 40, combined with the parallel story of Pat's escape
from Puss's dance. The song is taken from a popular game in which one
player represents the cat, another the rat; all the others form a line
with clasped hands, and Puss tries to catch Rat through the line, while
all sing the song. The bull's song belongs to number 88 or 89. Anansi's
fifing is possibly taken from 139.
