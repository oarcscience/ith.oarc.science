<P>Jekyll, 84-85, connects the animal competitors with the story of making the dumb girl speak, as in numbers 95, 96. In Milne-Home, 73-77, the animals compete to sing at the king's dance. In African parallels, some peril is involved of which a bird is to bear warning. But in all my versions and in those given by Mrs. Parsons from Andros Island, 112-113, the birds summon the father of a new-born child. The song of one of my versions from Maroon-town runs,</P><DIR>

</FONT><P>The husband reaches home in haste. The lady gives Pea-fowl the promised reward, and "he took the bag of gold and the silver, and in his joy he threw it right over his head, over his entire body, never remembered his two feet. That's the reason why Pea-fowl's so handsome all over- has such beautiful feathers and such ugly feet."</P>
