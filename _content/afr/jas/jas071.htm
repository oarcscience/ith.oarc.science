</I><P>The husband and wife married people, and the husband a great gambler, never at home with the wife; until the wife. going to have a baby, and the ninth month come now. So they send for the mid-wife; so when the mid-wife come, there is no husband in. She said she want 'some one to go call the husband, name of him is John Studee. So she call for all the thing they have in the yard. She call for a fowl, a cock, and say, "What will you say to call the husband?" The cock crew,</P><DIR>

</FONT><P>John Studee come now, say, "Who call my name?" See the bird up on the house-top, say, "Well, he want me!" Then he took up the fowl an' get the buggy in haste; and take off his gold chain off his neck an' put it on the pea-fowl. Pea-fowl have the golden feather round his neck on account of that gold chain. So when the feather came home, he got a boy chil' an' call his name John Studee after him.</P>

</I><P>Miss Nancy married Contavio. One day, Contavio went to market, but before he left home he locked up Miss Nancy till he came back. He did not come back that day, and as Miss Nancy was hungry and saw a sheep passing she said, "Do, my dear sheep, call Contavio for me and I will throw a lump of gold on your head." Bra Sheep goes, "Bep, baah&nbsp;baah&nbsp;baah." She said, "No, my dear Bra Sheep, that will not do." Soon after she saw a billy-goat and said the same thing to him. Bra Billy said, "Bep, bep, ba, ba, ba, bep-ba-ba-bep, bah, bah." She said, "No, my dear Bra Billy, that will not do." She then saw Bra Peacock coming up an' she said, "Bra Peacock, if you call Contavio, my husband, for me, I will give you a lump of gold," and Bra Peacock flew right away until he saw Contavio, and he picked him in his head and picked off all the feathers, and spurred him the whole way home until all Bra Peacock's spurs dropped off. When he got Contavio home, Miss Nancy flung the lump of gold on Bra Peacock's head and that's why the feathers on a peacock's head look like gold. That's also the reason why it has no spurs, and a crow has no feathers on its head.</P>
