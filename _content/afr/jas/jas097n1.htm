<P>An old man over eighty who was present at the recital of this story remembered hearing it when he was a little boy. Hauling lumber was in old days accompanied by song. The story turns upon a theme common in American Indian hero cycles, that of a trickster's claim to magical powers which he does not possess.</P>
