<P>A less witty version of this popular Jamaica story occurs in Jekyll, 129-131.</P>
<P>In Dayrell, 64-65, Sun and Water are great friends. Sun visits Water, but Water never visits Sun. At length, Sun invites Water and builds a great compound to receive him and his friends. All come, take possession, and crowd Sun and his wife, Moon, out into the sky.</P>
