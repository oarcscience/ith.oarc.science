### 134. The Pannier-jar.

Vassel Edwards, Retirement, Cock-pit country.

There was a man at slave time had a wife, and the wife kept two other
men. The husband of that wife was working out. One night, one came first
and then the house-master came home. And they had a big jar called a
pannier-jar, and the wife took the man and put him into the pannier-jar.
Afterward the other man came

{p. 164}

in, and when he saw the house-master was frightened and he told the
house-master he had come to borrow the pannier-jar. The house-master
told him he could take it, and the woman helped him tip with the
pannier-jar. And when he got part of the way, he said, "Poor me bwoy! if
it wasn't for this pannier-jar, I would be dead tonight!" The other man
in the pannier-jar said, "Brar, same meself!" And he got frightened and
heaved down the pannier-jar, mashed it up and killed the man in there.
