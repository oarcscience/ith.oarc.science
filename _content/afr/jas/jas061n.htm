<P>See number 149, where the bird in the tree starves and Hopping {p. 262} Dick on the ground picks up worms and wins the match. In this story, though incomplete, it is intimated that the bird in the tree wins,</P>
<P>Compare Dayrell, 153-155; Harris, Nights, 370-373; Fortier, 34-37; Parsons, Andros Island, 97 99.</P>
<P>In Dayrell, the birds propose to starve seven days to see which will be king. One leaves a hole out of which he creeps unobserved to feed.</P>
<P>In Harris, as in this Jamaica version, the winning bird takes up his station in the tree; the "fool bud" stays down by the creek.</P>
<P>In Parsons, one bird chooses a fruit tree, the other a "dry" tree. The song sung by the winning bird runs,--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"This day Monday mornin'<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tama&nbsp;tama tam!"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>and so on for the remaining days of the week.</P>
<P>In Fortier, the lady-love brings food to her favorite bird. The cooing song in the Jamaica versions suggests this connection.</P>
