*NOTE:* 

### 33. Fling-a-mile.

Jekyll, 152-155, has a good version of this very popular Jamaica story.

Compare the Bulu tales, Schwab, JAFL 27:284-285; 32:434.

In JAFL 27, Turtle sets a trap and by pretending to teach other animals
who come along one by one how to use it, he catches one victim after
another until he is himself caught.

In JAFL 32, Pangolin offers to initiate the animals one by one and makes
them climb a tree and jump upon a concealed rock, which kills them.
Turtle finally circumvents the trick.

In a Jamaica version collected in Mandeville, Anansi holds a butchering
at a place where there is a tree which seizes any person who leans
against it and flings him upon a lance which Anansi has set up.
