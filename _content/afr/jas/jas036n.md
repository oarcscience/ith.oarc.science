*NOTE:* 

### 36. Horse and Anansi.

For the trick of sending after fire in order to enjoy the whole of a
common store compare Koelle, 166-167; Tremearne, 255, 263; Hartt, 34;
Harris, Friends, 79-80; Nights, 282-284; Christensen, 89; Georgia, JAFL
32:403.

For the trick of leaving the knife or the spoon behind, see number 11 in
this collection.

For the fire-test see 21a and note to number 9.

It is clear, from the picture drawn of Horse as he starts for the Fire,
that the story-teller thinks of the actors in the story as animals, even
when he shows them behaving like human beings.
