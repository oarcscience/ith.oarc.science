So Anansi say he <B><I>mus'</B></I> eat something out of it, because he's going to fix himself into a place where people <B><I>mus'</B></I> talk him. So he get a hoe an' a pick-axe an' a machete an' go to a broad flat rock near the side of the road where everyone pass, begun to knock, pong&nbsp;pong&nbsp;pong. Hog was passing. Hog say, "Mawning, Brar Anansi." Anansi say, "Mawning, Brar Hog." Hog say, "Wha you do deh?" Anansi say, "Governor pass law an' say famine coming upon lan' an' ev'rybody mus' work groun', so me deh try see wha' me kyan' do." So Hog went on.
