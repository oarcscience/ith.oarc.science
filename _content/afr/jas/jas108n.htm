<CENTER><I>NOTE:</I>&nbsp;</CENTER><H3 ALIGN="CENTER">108. Big Begum and Little Begum.</H3>
<P>See note to number 106. The story is a version of Hans Anderson's Big Claus and Little Claus, Grimm 61; Bolte u. Pol&iacute;vka 2:1-18 and contains three episodes. (1) "Little Begum" tricks "Big Begum" into killing his oxen to get gold. (2) and (3) He exchanges places in the bag, gets a drove of sheep, and tricks "Big Begum" into getting himself drowned in the same bag, as in number 107.</P>
<P>(1) Episode F in Bolte u. Pol&iacute;vka's analysis. This informant's stories were not well motivated; the version does not explain how "Little Begum" sold the pretended magic hide. In Arcin, 475-476, Zeltner, 62-72, and Parsons, Andros Island, 86, the episode is accompanied by the trick of the life-giving staff (G' and see number 106); in Edwards, 95-96, by the trick of the dead mother pretended slain (G" and see number 135).</P>
<P>(2) and (3) In Fortier, 88-89, as in this version, (1) is accompanied by the bag trick, episodes H and J in Bolte u. Pol&iacute;vka's analysis. See also number 23.</P>
<P>Compare the "Pedro Ordimales" cycle in Recinos, JAFL 31:474-477.</P>
