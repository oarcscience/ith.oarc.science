</I><P>There was an old woman, a witch, but she was very wealthy. She lived quite to herself. Plenty of stock-horses, cows, sheep, mules, each kind kept by itself in a separate pasture. The old lady's name was Grandy Beard-o, but nobody knew that name. She wanted a person to sup with her. She came across a little girl one day. The took that girl home. After she prepared her meal, she called the girl and asked her if she knew her name. The girl said, "No, ma'am." She said to the girl, "Unless you tell me my name, I will not give you anything to eat."</P>
<P>She started out the girl to go and fetch some water. The girl had to go through all the pastures to get where the water was--mules to themselves, cows to themselves, horses to themselves, sheep to themselves. She went along crying, being hungry. So she got into cow-pasture--that was first pasture. The cow said to her, "What's the matter with you, me baby?"</P>
<P>The girl said, "The old lady will not give me anything to eat except me can tell her&nbsp;her name!" Cow was afraid to tell her.</P>
<P>From there she went into mule pasture, crying all the same. Mule said, "What's the matter, me baby?"</P>
<P>The girl said, "The old lady will not give me anything to eat, except me can tell her&nbsp;her name!" Mule wouldn't tell her.</P>
<P>She got into horse pasture, crying all the way. Horse said, "What's the matter, me baby?'</P>
<P>"Old lady in there won't give me anything to eat except me can tell her&nbsp;her name!" Horse wouldn't tell her.</P>
<P>From there she went into bull pasture, still crying. Bull said, "What's the matter, me baby?"</P>
<P>"Old lady won't give me anything to eat except me can tell her&nbsp;her name!"</P>
<P>Bull says, "Cho! when you go home, tell her&nbsp;her name Grandy Beard-o." Bull was a mighty man; he didn't care!</P>
<P>The girl was so glad, hastened home so as to get something to eat. Old lady said, "You can tell me my name make me give you something to eat?"</P>
<P>The girl said, "Your name Grandy Beard-o, ma'am."</P>
<P>Old lady got so indignant! She gave the girl a good feed and after that she started to find who told the girl, Went into cow pasture.</P><DIR>

</FONT><P>The old lady gripped the bull and tossed him in the air. The bull dropped; nothing happened. The bull tossed her in the air now, and she dropped; one leg broken, She tossed the bull again; the bull came down unhurt. The bull tossed her up again; she came down, another leg was broken.</P>
<P>She tossed the bull; nothing happened. The bull tossed her; she came down, one arm broken. She tossed the bull again; the bull came down unhurt. The bull tossed her again; she came down, the other arm was broken.</P>
