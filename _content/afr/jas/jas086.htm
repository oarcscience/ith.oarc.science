<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">Emilina Dodd, Lacovia.</P>
</I><P>A woman have a daughter, oftentimes engaged and wouldn't marry, said that the gentlemen weren't to her sort; until one day</P>
<P>{p. 107}</P>
<P>she see a well-dressed gentleman, came and proposed to her. But she has a brother was an Old Witch, told her that man was a snake. She said the man was too well-dressed to be a snake, but the brother was going home with them under the carriage as a lizard. The first place, as he was going on, somebody ask, "Mr. Snake, I beg you give me my collar," and the next, "Mr. Snake, I beg you give me my jacket," and so on until he show himself plain as a snake.</P>
<P>When they get home, he lock her up wanting to kill her, but couldn't kill her without the thing called "bump." Go out in the yard looking for it. After them gone, the mother-in-law said, "Me daughter, dis man you marry going to kill you because he is a bad man and he marry a wife already and kill her and he gwine to kill you too. I would let you go, but him have one cock, him so chat!" So she threw a barrel of wheat an' a barrel of corn. When the cock was picking it up he say, "I don' care a damn, I will nyam an' talk!" sing,--</P><DIR>

</DIR>

</FONT><P>Then they throw a double quantity. The cock pick it up an' sing,--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>"Ko&nbsp;ko re ko kom on do!<BR>
Girl gone, him no gone,<BR>
Ko&nbsp;ko re ko kom on do!"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</FONT><P>Then Snake come from the wood while the brother was taking her on the water. Snake overtake her, take her home again and lock her in, go back in the wood again in search of "bump." And mother-in-law throw a double quantity of wheat and corn. Cock say again, "I don't care a damn, I will nyam an' talk!" The cock eatey all and sing,--</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>"Ko&nbsp;ko re kom on do!<BR>
Girl gone, him no gone,<BR>
Ko&nbsp;ko re ko kom on do!"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</FONT><P>So when Snake come out from the wood, he couldn't get her again because she was near on land. So he went back home an' tek a stick an' lick the mother-in-law on the head, kill her.</P>
