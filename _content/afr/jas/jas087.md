Deh was an ol' woman who had a daughter an' a son. De son was an Ol'

gentlemen who make application fo' de girl to marry, but de mudder
refuse dem. At las' de debbil dress himself nicely an' went, an' he was
accepted by de ol' lady, an' begun to co't de girl.

{p. 110}

De boy, being an ol' witch, know dat it was de debbil. He tol' de mudder
not to allow his sister to marry to de man, for de man is de debbil. De
mudder said, "Go 'way, sah! what you know? You can call a gentleman like
dat de debbil?" So when de debbil walking, his knee sing a song like
ringing a bell. It go like dis:

"Dirt i' room a yerry, double bing, double bing,  
Dirt i' room a yerry, double bing, double bing,  
Dirt i' room a yerry, double bing, double bing,  
Belling belling beng, bell i' leng beng."

De boy overhear de debbil knee singing. But, now, anybody else sing de
song, de debbil clo'es will drop off, a horn grow on head, an' tail grow
out on him too. So one night while he was in de house talking, de little
boy was underneat' de table singing de song quietly:

'Dirt i' room a yerry, double bing, double bing."

When de debbil hear dat he say, "Look heah, mistress, stop dat bwoy from
singing dat song! I don' like it." De ol' woman say, "Massah, me kyan'
stop him singing, because it mus' of been his little play-song\[1\] what
he have singing." So de debbil say, "Well, I don' like to hear it!"

De boy now sing de song much louder, an' de debbil knee begin to sing it
very loud--

"Dirt i' room a yerry, double bing, double bing!"

an' de clo'es drop off an' de tail an' horns grow out. So de boy say to
de mudder, "Didn't I tell you dat man was a debbil, an' you would not
believe it!"

\[1. Jamaica children compose a "secret song" which they amuse
themselves with at play or sing when they are walking alone.\]

##### c. Gracie and Miles.

Florence Thomlinson, Lacovia.

There was once a girl by the name of Gracie and a man Miles. They were
engaged. And Miles always came to see Gracie most every evening, and he
would always sing for her. Song was about Gracie; says that Gracie is a
fine girl, but he is going to kill her.

<span id="11000.jpg">![](img/11000.jpg)</span>  
Me a Miles a moo me a Miles a moo  
Fe me Gra-cie is a {p. 111}  
<span id="11100.jpg">![](img/11100.jpg)</span>  
fine gal Fe me Gra-cie have a kill her.  
Pong, me la-dy, pong moo!  
Pong, me la-dy, pong moo!  
Me a Miles a moo me a Miles a moo.  
Fe me Gra-cie is a fine gal  
Fe me Gra-cie have a kill her.

She didn't know he would kill her fe true.

She has a little brother stop in the yard with her. (Miles) worked in
the field every day; they would send his breakfast by the little boy to
him. When (the boy) nearly got to him, he wasn't a man; he was a bull.
When he see the boy coming, he turn a man. The boy tell his sister, "You
know that man is not a man, he's a bull!" and she said, "Oh, cho!
nonsense! How you could expect that?" The little boy said, "If you think
it is not true, you go with me, stop back." Next day she went after the
boy and stay far back and see it was a bull eating grass, not a man. He
sing,

"Me a Miles a moo, me Gracie is a fine girl,  
Me Gracie me wi' kill her."

She know it is a bull now. When he come, the sister say tomorrow evening
must have a ball now. So he says he will come. So she get up a lot of
men with ropes and have music and all in the house. So the little boy
begin to sing the song now:

"Me a Miles a moo, me Gracie is a fine girl,  
Me Gracie me wi' kill her."

Miles said, "Oh, where that little boy come from? Turn him out!" Hoof
begin to grow, horn begin to grow, tail begin to grow and he get a big
bull, and they toss him and rope him and pole him, turn him out.
