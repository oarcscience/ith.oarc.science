yo' bel-ly full wid de red yam.  
Sing, ma bwa, sing, ma bwa, sing, ma bwa,

\[1. The narrator continued with the following which, she insisted,
belongs with the song:

<span id="17502.jpg">![](img/17502.jpg)</span>  
Tom drunk, but Tom no fool, Tom drunk, but Tom no fool,
Trala-la-la-la-la-la.

This last measure may be repeated at will, or the whole three about Tom.
The oftener it is sung, the sweeter the song, in Mother Roden's opinion
and in that of many others.

This singer was most uncertain; in intonation, repetitions, etc. she
varied exceedingly and agreed that any way the song was repeated to her
by the transcriber was correct, no matter how It was sung. The
transcriber, therefore, will not vouch for these three tunes. The old
woman is a cripple and can neither read nor write. H. R.\]
