<P>The "Just so" story, number 51, is another version of the diving plot, which is popular in Jamaica. Jekyll tells it, 7-9, in form (b).</P>
<P>Compare: Chatelain, 205; Junod, 208; Renel, 254; JAFL 32:395; Nights, 373-377; Parsons, Sea Islands, 40.</P>
<P>In all these cases, the trickster proposes diving and eats a store of food while his companion is in the water. The grotesque idea of bodily dismemberment coupled with the diving episode, I do not find in any of the parallels noted. In Parsons, Andros Island, 73, Boukee and Elephant go out bird-hunting. Boukee shoots Elephant and brings him home to the family. Boukee is brought to justice because the children are overheard singing,</P><DIR>

<P>"Me an' Mamma'n Pappa<BR>
Eat my belly full o' pot o' soup<BR>
Bo'o' Elephin got (gut), oh!"</P></DIR>

<P>For the incriminating song in version (b), see number 4.</P>
