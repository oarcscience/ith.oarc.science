 \[[87. Bull as Bridegroom.](jas087)\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*NOTE:* 

### 87. Bull as Bridegroom.

The story of the beast-husband transformed by means of a song is very
common in Jamaica. It occurs in Milne-Home, 42-45, and Jekyll, 73-77;
132-135.

Compare Junod, 246-253; Parsons, Andros Island, 39-43 and references in
note 1.

In Parsons's Andros Island variants, the transformed beast is the wife
(compare number 84) and has the form of a bird, as in Jekyll's two
versions, one of which, 132-135, ends with the "Yonec" story. In all the
versions I heard, and in Milne-Home, the wooer is a bull.
