<P>
This companion book to
<A HREF="../ppj/index">Psychic Phenomena of Jamaica</A> goes into
much greater depth as to the New World-African connection,
and adds more material about Afro-Carribean religion in Haiti.
The primary strength of this work is the careful documentation
of the history and ethnography of Vodun.
Williams includes numerous quotes from rare documents and books on the subject.
The weakness is the lack of detailed information about
the religious system of Vodun, which we now know to be
as complicated (or more so) than any of the major religions.
There is scarcely any mention of the loas, the pantheon of Vodun Gods
and Goddesses, and he misses the importance of possession
during the religious ceremonies.
However, all things considered, this is required reading if you want
to understand the background of Haitian and Jamaican Vodun, and
the profound influence of imperialism, slavery and racism
on its development.--jbh.
