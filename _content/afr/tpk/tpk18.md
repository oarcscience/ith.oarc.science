# "FORWARD TO THE KING OF KINGS"

#### By The Rt. Hon. L. P. Howell

#### "THE GONG"

His Majesty Ras Tafari is the head over all man for he is the Supreme
God. His body is the fullness of him that fillet all in all.

 

Now my dear people let this be our goal:

Forward to the King of Kings must be the cry of our social hope.

Forward to the King of Kings to purify our social standards and our way
of living, and rebuild and inspire our character.

Forward to the King of Kings to learn the worth of manhood and
womanhood.

Forward to the King of Kings to learn His code of Laws from the mount
demanding absolute Love, Purity, Honesty, and Truthfulness.

Forward to the King of Kings to learn His Laws and social order, so that
virtue will eventually gain the victory over body and soul and that
truth will drive away falsehood and fraud.

 

Members of the King of Kings arise for God's sake and put your armor on.
