This is a proto-Rastafarian tract by Leonard Howell, a Jamaican
preacher. Published around 1935, this is obviously an edited, much
shorter, version of [The Royal Parchment Scroll of Black
Supremacy](../rps/index), without the stream-of-consciousness language,
long opaque abbreviations, and repetition. Most significantly, the
identities of 'King Alpha and Queen Omega' were transposed from Fitz
Balintine Pettersburg and his wife as in the Royal Parchment Scroll, to
Emperor Haile Selassie and Empress Menen Astaw. This was one of the key
innovations of the Howellites, and is today an article of faith of
Rastafarianism.

In 1933, Howell started to preach that the Emperor Haile Selassie of
Ethiopia (Ras Tafari) was the Messiah, that Black people were the chosen
people, and would soon be repatriated to Ethiopia. He soon attracted the
attention of the colonial authorities, and was arrested in December 1934
for sedition. In March of 1934 he was sentenced to two years
imprisonment, during which he apparently wrote The Promised Key. After
he was released in 1936, he published a newspaper called "The People's
Voice". In 1954 his commune was raided and much literature, including
copies of this book, were burned. Howell was found dead under suspicious
circumstances in February 1981.
