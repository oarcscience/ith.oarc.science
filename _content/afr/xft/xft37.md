# THE STORY OF LONG SNAKE.

In this story the girls are represented as taking fermented milk to the
man. This is not in accordance with ordinary Kaffir usage, which
prohibits females from serving out milk. But Long Snake, though a man,
has been bewitched and obliged to assume the appearance of a serpent,
retaining however the faculties of a human being.

Kaffir women grind, or rather bruise, millet by putting it on a flat
stone, before which the worker kneels, and crushing it with a small
round stone hold in the hands. When several are working near each other
of an evening, they usually lighten their labours by a rude chant. The
bruised substance is mixed with water, and formed into small loaves of
very insipid bread.
