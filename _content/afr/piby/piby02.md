# PREFACE

The Holy Piby, a book founded by the Holy Spirit to deliver the gospel
commanded by the Almighty God for the full salvation of Ethiopia's
posterities.

In time the *Piby* shall contain all worthy prophecies and inspirations
endowed by God upon the sons and daughters of Ethiopia, but no article
shall be permitted to enter the *Piby* save that which is in accordance
with the gospel of the twentieth century, preached by his Holiness,
Shepherd Athlyi, apostle Marcus Garvey and colleague; the three apostles
anointed and sent forth by the Almighty God to lay the foundation of
industry, liberty and justice unto the generations of Ethiopia that they
prove themselves a power among the nations and in the glory of their
God.

The *Piby* is strictly Holy, dedicated to the cause of saving souls for
God upon which the Afro Athlican Constructive Church is built, therefore
articles not agreeable shall not be entered upon or under the covers
thereof.

Help to build Athlican Colleges, prepare your sons and daughters for a
high position in [the](errata.htm#0) Athlican organization.
