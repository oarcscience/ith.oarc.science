# PROCLAMATION OF THE HOUSE OF ATHLYI

Woodbridge, N.J., U.S.A. March 1924

His Holiness, Shepherd Athlyi, 1st of the House of Athlyi, supreme lord
of the Afro Athlican Constructive Church, requests that all Negroes the
world over celebrate concord in its fullness.

The first of August all members of the A.A.C. Church shall join in with
the Universal Negro Improvement Association that there be a united day
of joviality.

O God, bless thine Apostles, and help us to establish a Heaven on earth.

Proclamated by the  
HOUSE OF ATHLYI
