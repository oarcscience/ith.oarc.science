<H2 ALIGN="center">III<BR> AKITI THE HUNTER</H2>

<P>A <SMALL>FAMOUS</SMALL> hunter and wrestler named Akiti boasted that he was stronger than any other man or animal. He had easily overcome a giant, a leopard, a lion, a wolf, and

a boa-constrictor, and as nobody else opposed his claim, he called himself &#8220;the King of the forest.&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8195;Wherever he went, he sang his triumphant wrestling-song, and everyone feared and respected him. But he had forgotten the Elephant, who is a very wise animal and knows many charms. One day the Elephant challenged him and declared that he had no right to call himself &#8220;King,&#8221; as the Elephant himself was the monarch of the forest and could not be defeated.</P>

<P>&#8195;Akiti thereupon flung his spear at his enemy, but because of the Elephant&#8217;s charm, the weapon glanced off his hide and did him no harm. Akiti next tried his bow and poisoned arrows, and his hunting-knife, but still without effect.</P>

<P>&#8195;However, the hunter also possessed a charm, and by using it, he changed himself into a lion and flew at the Elephant, but the Elephant flung him off. Next he became a serpent, but he could not succeed in crushing the Elephant to death.</P>

<P>&#8195;At last he changed himself into a fly, and flew into the Elephant&#8217;s large flapping ear. He went right down inside until he came to the heart, and then he changed himself into a man again and cut up the heart with his hunting-knife. At last the Elephant fell dead, and Akiti stepped out of his body in triumph, for he was now without question &#8220;the King of the forest.&#8221;</P>
