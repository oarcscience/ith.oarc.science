<H2 ALIGN="center">XXXV<BR> THE THREE DEATHS OF TORTOISE</H2>

<P>T<SMALL>ORTOISE</SMALL> had many enemies, and they plotted together to kill him.</P>

<P>&#8195;One night when Tortoise was asleep in his hut, they set fire to it, and as they saw the flames leaping up, they said to one another:</P>

<P>&#8195;&#8220;He cannot escape. He will die.&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8195;But Tortoise drew himself into his shell and was untouched by the fire, and in the morning his enemies were astonished to see him walking about as usual.</P>

<P>&#8195;Soon they made another plan and threw Tortoise into a pool of water.</P>

<P>&#8195;&#8220;The pool is deep. He will drown,&#8221; said his enemies to one another.</P>

<P>&#8195;But Tortoise had drawn himself into his shell and was secure, and at noon the sun shone fiercely and dried up the pool.</P>

<P>&#8195;That evening Tortoise walked about the village as if nothing had happened, and his enemies were astonished.</P>

<P>&#8195;The next day they made a third attempt to kill him. They made a deep hole in the ground and buried Tortoise, and this time they were quite sure he could not escape. To mark the place, they put a bamboo stake in the ground.</P>

<P>&#8195;Meanwhile a man who was passing saw the bamboo stake, and thought, &#8220;Someone has buried a treasure here!&#8221; He called his friends, and they began to dig, but all they found was Tortoise fast asleep inside his shell.</P>

<P>&#8195;Tortoise walked about the village again, looking very happy, and his enemies were filled with astonishment.</P>

<P>&#8195;&#8220;He has a charm, and we shall never be able to kill him,&#8221; they said to one another, and from that day they left him in peace.</P>
