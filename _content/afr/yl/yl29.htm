evening, as he went from basket to basket in his canoe, he was disappointed to find that no fishes, or only a few very small ones, had been caught.</P>

<P>&#8195;This made him very sad, and he was forced to live frugally.</P>

<P>&#8195;One day he found a stranger lying asleep on the river-bank. Instead of killing the stranger, the fisherman spoke kindly to him, and invited him to share his evening meal.</P>

<P>&#8195;The stranger appeared very pleased and ate and drank, but spoke no word at all, The fisherman thought: &#8220;He speaks another language.&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8195;Quite suddenly the stranger vanished, and only the remains of the meal convinced the fisherman that he had not been dreaming.</P>

the baskets were again quite full, and when the fisherman came to the last basket he saw that it contained a single monstrous fish.</P>

<P>&#8195;&#8220;Do you not know me?&#8221; said the fish.</P>

<P>&#8195;&#8220;Indeed no, Mr. Fish. I have never seen you before!&#8221; declared the fisherman, nearly upsetting the canoe in his astonishment.</P>

<P>&#8195;&#8220;Have you forgotten the stranger whom you treated so courteously?&#8221; went on the fish. &#8220;It was I, and I am the King of the fishes. I am grateful for your kindness and intend to reward you.&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8195;Then the fish jumped into the river with a great splash. But ever afterwards the fishing-baskets were full every evening, and the fisherman became rich and prosperous.</P>
