## XIII THE WATER-BIRD

T<span class="small">HE</span> water-bird always stands on one leg, and
this is why:

 A water-bird once, in search of food, swallowed the King of the crabs,
and the whole tribe of crabs were so enraged that they swore they would
have their revenge.

 “We will find this horrible bird,” they declared, “and nip off its
legs. We shall not fail to find it, for its legs are bright <span
id="page_21">p. 21</span> pink in colour and its feathers are pink and
white.”

 But the water-rat overheard the crabs plotting, and hastened to tell
the water-bird.

 “Oh! Oh!” cried the water-bird. “They will nip off my beautiful pink
legs, and then what will become of me? Whatever can I do?”

 “It is very simple,” replied the water-rat. “If you stand on one leg,
they will think you are some other creature.”

 The bird thanked him and tucked up one leg. When the crabs came, they
saw, as they thought, a very tall pink bird with one leg and a large
beak.

 “Our enemy has two legs,” they said. “This cannot be he.” And they
passed by.
