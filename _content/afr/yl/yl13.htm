<H2 ALIGN="center">XI<BR> THE BAT</H2>

<P>T<SMALL>HE</SMALL> Bat is half a bird and half a rodent, and lives partly on the earth and partly in the air, but both rats and birds shun him, and this is why:</P>

<P>&#8195;The rats, his cousins, were once fighting a great battle with the birds, and Bat fought in their midst.</P>

<P>&#8195;But when he saw that the birds were likely to be victorious, he left the rats and flew up into the air to fight on the side of the birds.</P>

<P>&#8195;Both the rats and the birds were disgusted at this cowardly action, so they ceased from fighting one another and all combined to attack the Bat.</P>

<P>&#8195;Since that day he has been forced to hide in dark places all day, and only comes out in the evening when his enemies cannot see him.</P>
