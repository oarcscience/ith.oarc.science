# YORUBA LEGENDS

## I THE KINGDOM OF THE YORUBAS

T<span class="small">HE</span> ancient King Oduduwa had a great many
grandchildren, and on his death he divided among them all his
possessions. But his youngest grandson, Oranyan, was at that time away
hunting, and when he returned home he learnt that his brothers and
cousins had inherited the old King’s money, cattle, beads, native
cloths, and crowns, but that to himself nothing was left but twenty-one
pieces of iron, a cock, and some soil tied up in a rag.

 At that time the whole earth was covered with water, on the surface of
which the people lived.

 The resourceful Oranyan spread upon the water his pieces of iron, and
upon the iron he placed the scrap of cloth, and upon the cloth the soil,
and on the soil the cock. <span id="page_2">p. 2</span> The cock
scratched with his feet and scattered the soil far and wide, so that the
ocean was partly filled up and islands appeared everywhere. The pieces
of iron became the mineral wealth hidden under the ground.

 Now Oranyan’s brothers and cousins all desired to live on the land, and
Oranyan allowed them to do so on payment of tribute. He thus became King
of all the Yorubas, and was rich and prosperous through his
grandfather’s inheritance.
