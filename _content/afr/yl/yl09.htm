<H2 ALIGN="center">VII<BR> THE OL<U>O</U>FIN AND THE MICE</H2>

<P>A <SMALL>FAMOUS</SMALL> Ol<U>o</U>fin, or Yoruba King, was once imprisoned by his enemies in a hut without any door or roof-opening, and left to die of starvation.</P>

<P>&#8195;As he sat gloomily on the ground, the Ol<U>o</U>fin saw a little mouse running across the hut. He seized his knife, exclaiming: &#8220;Rather than die of hunger, I will eat this mouse!&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8195;But on second thoughts he put away his knife, saying: &#8220;Why should I kill the mouse? I shall starve later on, just the same.&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8195;To his surprise the mouse addressed him in the following words:</P>

<P>&#8195;&#8220;Noble King! Greetings to you on your generosity! You have spared my life, and in return I will spare yours.&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8195;The mouse then disappeared into a hole in the ground, and returned some time afterwards followed by twenty or thirty other mice, all bearing grains of corn, gari, and small fruits.</P>

<P>&#8195;For five days they fed him in this manner, and on the sixth day the hut was opened by the Ol<U>o</U>fin&#8217;s captors, who were astonished to find him still alive and in good health.</P>

<P>&#8195;&#8220;This Ol<U>o</U>fin must have a powerful charm!&#8221; they declared. &#8220;It appears that he can live without eating or drinking!&#8221;</P>

<P>&#8195;Thereupon they released him, gave him a war-canoe, and let him return in freedom to his own country.</P>
