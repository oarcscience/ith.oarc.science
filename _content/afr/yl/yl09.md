## VII THE OL<u>O</u>FIN AND THE MICE

A <span class="small">FAMOUS</span> Ol<u>o</u>fin, or Yoruba King, was
once imprisoned by his enemies in a hut without any door or
roof-opening, and left to die of starvation.

 As he sat gloomily on the ground, the Ol<u>o</u>fin saw a little mouse
running across the hut. He seized his knife, exclaiming: “Rather than
die of hunger, I will eat this mouse!”

 But on second thoughts he put away his knife, saying: “Why should I
kill the mouse? I shall starve later on, just the same.”

 To his surprise the mouse addressed him in the following words:

 “Noble King! Greetings to you on your generosity! You have spared my
life, and in return I will spare yours.”

 The mouse then disappeared into a hole in the ground, and returned some
time afterwards followed by twenty or thirty other mice, all bearing
grains of corn, gari, and small fruits.

 For five days they fed him in this manner, and on the sixth day the hut
was opened by the Ol<u>o</u>fin’s captors, who were astonished to find
him still alive and in good health.

 “This Ol<u>o</u>fin must have a powerful charm!” they declared. “It
appears that he can live without eating or drinking!”

 Thereupon they released him, gave him a war-canoe, and let him return
in freedom to his own country.
