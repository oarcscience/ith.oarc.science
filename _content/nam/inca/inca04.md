# THREE INCA PRAYERS

### From: Ancient Civilizations of the Andes by Philip Ainsworth Means, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1931, pp. 437-439.

## TO VIRACOCHA

Viracocha, Lord of the Universe!  
Whether male or female,  
at any rate commander of heat and reproduction,  
being one who,  
even with His spittle, can work sorcery,  
Where art Thou?  
Would that Thou wert not hidden from this son of Thine!  
He may be above;  
He may be below;  
or, perchance, abroad in space.  
Where is his mighty judgment-seat?  
Hear me!  
He may be spread abroad among the upper waters;  
or, among the lower waters and their sands  
He may be dwelling.  
Creator of the world,  
Creator of man,  
great among my ancestors,  
before Thee my eyes fail me,  
though I long to see Thee;  
for, seeing Thee,  
knowing Thee,  
learning from Thee,  
understanding Thee,  
I shall be seen by Thee,  
and Thou wilt know me.  
The Sun--the Moon;  
The Day--the Night;  
Summer--Winter;  
not in vain,  
in orderly succession,  
do they march to their destined place,  
to their goal.  
They arrive  
wherever  
Thy royal staff  
Thou bearest.  
Oh! Harken to me,  
listen to me,  
let it not befall  
that I grow weary  
and die.

## TO VIRACOCHA

O conquering Viracocha!  
Ever-present Viracocha!  
Thou who art without equal upon the earth!  
Thou who art from the beginnings of the world until its end!  
Thou gavest life and valour to men, saying,  
"Let this be a man."  
And to woman, saying,  
"Let this be a woman."  
Thou madest them and gavest them being.  
Watch over them, that they may live in health and in peace.  
Thou who art in the highest heavens,  
and among the clouds of the tempest,  
grant them long life,  
and accept this our sacrifice,  
O Creator.

## TO PACHACAMAC

O Pachacamac!  
Thou who hast existed from the beginning,  
Thou who shalt exist until the end,  
powerful but merciful,  
Who didst create man by saying,  
"Let man be,"  
Who defendest us from evil,  
and preservest our life and our health,  
art Thou in the sky or upon the earth?  
In the clouds or in the deeps?  
Hear the voice of him who implores Thee,  
and grant him his petitions.  
Give us life everlasting,  
preserve us, and accept this our sacrifice.
