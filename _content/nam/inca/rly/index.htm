<P>This book is a compendium of translations of four rather disparate documents relating to pre-conquest Peru. As with most early studies of Spanish America, they range rather freely between religion, history, and laws. The fourth in particular is exclusively concerned with laws, while the third is mythological, and is also interesting because it deals with an outlying province of the Inca empire. The printed book also contains a fifty page index of subjects, places, names, and Quechua words which is not reproduced here.</P>
