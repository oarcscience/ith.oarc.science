<p>A rocky height above Cuzco to the NE. Distant view of the city of Cuzco and of the Sacsahuaman hill, crowned by the fortress</i>.</p><dir> <dir>  
<p>(<i>Enter</i> OLLANTAY <i>armed</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Alas, Ollantay! Ollantay!<br> Thou master of so many lands,<br> Insulted by him thou servedst well.<br> O my thrice-beloved Coyllur,<br> Thee too I shall lose for ever.</p> 
<p><a name="page_361"><font size="1" color="green">p. 361</font></A></p> 
<p>O the void&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> within my heart,<br> O my princess! O precious dove!<br> Cuzco! O thou beautiful city!<br> Henceforth behold thine enemy.<br> I'll bare thy breast to stab thy heart,<br> And throw it as food for condors;<br> Thy cruel Inca I will slay.<br> I will call my men in thousands,<br> The Antis will be assembled,<br> Collected as with a lasso.<br> All will be trained, all fully armed,<br> I will guide them to Sacsahuaman.<br> They will be as a cloud of curses,<br> When flames rise to the heavens.<br> Cuzco shall sleep on a bloody couch,<br> The King shall perish in its fall;<br> Then shall my insulter see<br> How numerous are my followers.<br> When thou, proud King, art at my feet,<br> We then shall see if thou wilt say,<br> 'Thou art too base for Coyllur's hand.'<br> Not then will I bow down and ask,<br> For I, not thou, will be the King--<br> Yet, until then, let prudence rule.</p><dir> <dir>  
<p>(<i>Enter</i> PIQUI CHAQUI <i>from back</i>, R.)</p></dir> </dir>  
<p>Piqui Chaqui, go back with speed,<br> Tell the Princess I come to-night.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. I have only just come from there--<br> The palace was deserted quite,<br> No soul to tell me what had passed,<br> Not even a dog&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> was there.</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p>

<p><a name="page_362"><font size="1" color="green">p. 362</font></A></p> 
<p>All the doors were closed and fastened,<br> Except the principal doorway,<br> And that was left without a guard.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. And the servants?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. Even the mice had fled and gone,<br> For nothing had been left to eat.<br> Only an owl was brooding there,<br> Uttering its cry of evil omen.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Perhaps then her father has taken her,<br> To hide her in his palace bounds.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. The Inca may have strangled her;<br> Her mother too has disappeared.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Did no one ask for me<br> Before you went away?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. Near a thousand men are seeking<br> For you, and all are enemies,<br> Armed with their miserable clubs.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. If they all arose against me,<br> With this arm I'd fight them all<br> No one yet has beat this hand,<br> Wielding the <i>champi</i> sharp and true.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. I too would like to give a stroke<br> At least, if my enemy was unarmed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. To whom?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. I mean that Urco Huaranca chief,<br> Who lately was in search of thee.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Perhaps the Inca sends him here<br> If so my anger is aroused.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. Not from the King, I am assured,<br> He cometh of his own accord<br> And yet he is an ignoble man.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. He has left Cuzco, I believe;</p> 
<p><a name="page_363"><font size="1" color="green">p. 363</font></A></p> 
<p>My own heart tells me it is so<br> I'm sure that owl announces it.<br> We'll take to the hills, at once.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. But wilt thou abandon the Star?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. What can I do, alas!<br> Since she has disappeared?<br> Alas, my dove! my sweet princess.</p><dir> <dir>  
<p>(<i>Music heard among the rocks</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. Listen to that <i>yarahui</i>,<br> The sound comes from somewhere near.</p> 
<p>(<i>They sit on rocks</i>.)</p> 
<p align="CENTER">SONG</p><dir> <dir>  
<p>In a moment I lost my beloved,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;She was gone, and I never knew where;<br> I sought her in fields and in woods,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Asking all if they 'd seen the Coyllur.</p> 
<p>Her face was so lovely and fair,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;They called her the beautiful Star.<br> No one else can be taken for her,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With her beauty no girl can compare.</p> 
<p>Both the sun and the moon seem to shine,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Resplendent they shine from a height,<br> Their rays to her beauty resign<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Their brilliant light with delight.</p> 
<p>Her hair is a soft raven black,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Her tresses are bound with gold thread,<br> They fall in long folds down her back,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And add charm to her beautiful head.</p> 
<p>Her eyelashes brighten her face,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Two rainbows less brilliant and fair,<a name="page_364"><font size="1" color="green">p. 364</font></A><br> Her eyes full of mercy and grace,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With nought but two, suns can compare.</p> 
<p>The eyelids with arrows concealed,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Gaily shoot their rays into the heart<br> They open, lo! beauty revealed,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Pierces through like a glittering dart.</p> 
<p>Her cheeks <i>Achancara</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> on snow,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Her face more fair than the dawn,<br> From her mouth the laughter doth flow,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Between pearls as bright as the morn.</p> 
<p>Smooth as crystal and spotlessly clear<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Is her throat, like the corn in a sheaf<br> Her bosoms, which scarcely appear,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Like flowers concealed by a leaf.</p> 
<p>Her beautiful hand is a sight,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;As it rests from all dangers secure,<br> Her fingers transparently white,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Like icicles spotless and pure.</p></dir> </dir>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i> (<i>rising</i>). That singer, unseen and unknown,<br> Has declared Coyllur's beauty and grace;<br> He should fly hence, where grief overwhelms.<br> O Princess! O loveliest Star,<br> I alone am the cause of thy death,<br> I also should die with my love.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. Perhaps thy star has passed away,<br> For the heavens are sombre and grey.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. When they know that their Chief has fled,</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p><a name="page_365"><font size="1" color="green">p. 365</font></A></p> 
<p>My people will rise at my call,<br> They will leave the tyrant in crowds<br> And he will be nearly alone.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. Thou hast love and affection from men,<br> For thy kindness endears thee to all,<br> For thy hand's always open with gifts,<br> And is closely shut only to me.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Of what hast thou need?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. What? the means to got this and that,<br> To offer a gift to my girl,<br> To let others see what I have,<br> So that I may be held in esteem.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Be as brave as thou art covetous,<br> And all the world will fear thee.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. My face is not suited for that;<br> Always gay and ready to laugh,<br> My features are not shaped that way.<br> To look brave! not becoming to me.<br> What clarions sound on the hills?<br> It quickly cometh near to us.</p><dir> <dir>  
<p>(<i>Both look out at different sides</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. I doubt not those who seek me--come,<br> Let us depart and quickly march.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. When flight is the word, I am here.</p>
