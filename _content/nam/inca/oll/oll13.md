### SCENE 2

Great hall of the palace of Tupac Yupanqui. *The* INCA *seated on
golden* tiana (C.).

(*Enter the* HIGH PRIEST *or* UILLAC UMA, *with priests and chosen
Virgins of the Sun. The* INCA *dressed as his father*. Uillac Uma *in
full dress, wearing the* huampar chucu. *Virgins in white with gold
belts and diadems. They range themselves by the throne* (L.). *Then
enter* RUMI-ÑAUI *and a crowd of chiefs, all in full dress, ranging
themselves by the throne* (R.).)

  *Tupac Yupanqui*. This day, O Councillors and Chiefs,  
Let all receive my benison;  
You Holy Virgins of the Sun <span id="fr_60"></span>[1](#fn_60)  
Receive our father's tenderest care.  
The realm, rejoicing, hails me king;  
From deep recesses of my heart  
I swear to seek the good of all.  
  *Uillac Uma*. To-day the smoke of many beasts  
Ascends on high towards the sun,  
The Deity with joy accepts  
The sacrifice of prayer and praise.

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

We found in ashes of the birds  
Our only Inca, King, and Lord,  
In the great llama sacrifice;  
All there beheld an eagle's form,  
We opened it for augury,  
But lo! the heart and entrails gone.  
The eagle Anti-suyu means--  
To thy allegiance they return.

(*Bowing to the Inca*.)

Thus I, thy augur, prophesy.

(*Acclamation*.) \[*Exeunt all but* Uillac Uma *and* Rumi-ñaui.

  *Tupac Yupanqui* (*turning to* Rumi-ñaui). Behold the Hanan-suyu
Chief  
Who let the enemy escape,  
Who led to almost certain death  
So many thousands of my men.  
  *Rumi-ñaui*. Before his death thy father knew  
Disaster had befallen me;  
'Tis true, O King, it was my fault,  
Like a stone <span id="fr_61"></span>[1](#fn_61) I gave my orders,  
And volleying stones soon beat me down;  
It was with stones I had to fight,  
And in the end they crushed my men.  
Oh! grant me, Lord, a single chance,  
Give perfect freedom to my plans,  
Myself will to the fortress march,  
And I will leave it desolate.  
  *Tupac Yupanqui*. For thee to strive with all thy might,  
For thee thine honour to regain,  
For thou shalt ne'er command my men  
Unless thy worthiness is proved.

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

  *Uillac Uma*. Not many days shall pass, O King,  
E'er all the Antis are subdued.  
I've seen it in the *quipu* roll,  
Haste! Haste! thou Rumi Tunqui. <span id="fr_62"></span>[1](#fn_62)

\[*Exeunt*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_60"></span>[382:1](oll13.htm#fr_60) *Intic Huamin Caccunan*
(*Intic Huarminca Caycuna*, correct), 'Ye women of the Sun.' Zegarra
thought, on the authority of Garcilasso de la Vega, that these could not
be select Virgins of the Sun, because the virgins were never allowed
outside their convent, and not even women might enter. He is clearly
wrong. Much higher authorities than Garcilasso, as regards this point,
especially Valera, tell us that the virgins were treated with the
greatest honour and respect. They took part in great receptions and
festivals, and when they passed along the streets they had a guard of
honour.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[383:1](oll13.htm#fr_61) Rumi. He keeps playing
upon his name.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[384:1](oll13.htm#fr_62) Again playing upon the
name of Rumi-ñaui. The High Priest calls for haste, so he substitutes
*Tunqui* for Ñaui (eye), the *tunqui* (*Rupicola Peruviana*) being one
of the most beautiful birds in the forests.
