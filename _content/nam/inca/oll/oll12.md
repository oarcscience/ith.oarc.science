# ACT III

### SCENE 1

The Pampa Moroni, a street in Cuzco. Enter RUMI-ÑAUI (L.) <span
id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53) *in a long black cloak with a train, and*
PIQUI CHAQUI (R.), *meeting each other*.

  *Rumi-ñaui*. Whence, Piqui Chaqui, comest thou?  
Dost thou here seek Ollantay's fate?  
  *Piqui Chaqui*. Cuzco, great lord, is my birthplace;  
I hasten back unto my home.  
I care not more to pass my days  
In dismal and profound ravines.  
  *Rumi-ñaui*. Tell me, Ollantay--what does he?  
  *Piqui Chaqui*. He is busy now entangling  
An already entangled skein.  
  *Rumi-ñaui*. What skein?

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

  *Piqui Chaqui*. Should you not give me some present  
If you want me to talk to you.  
  *Rumi-ñaui*. With a stick will I give thee blows,  
With a rope I will hang thee.  
  *Piqui Chaqui*. O, do not frighten me!  
  *Rumi-ñaui*. Speak then.  
  *Piqui Chaqui*. Ollantay. Is it Ollantay?  
I can remember no more.  
  *Rumi-ñaui*. Piqui Chaqui! Take care!  
  *Piqui Chaqui*. But you will not listen!  
I am turning blind,  
My ears are getting deaf,  
My grandmother is dead,  
My mother is left alone.  
  *Rumi-ñaui*. Where is Ollantay? Tell me.  
  *Piqui Chaqui*. I am in want of bread,  
And the *Paccays* <span id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54) are not ripe.  
I have a long journey to-day--  
The desert is very far off.  
  *Rumi-ñaui*. If you continue to vex me  
I will take your life.  
  *Piqui Chaqui*. Ollantay, is it? He is at work.  
Ollantay! He is building a wall,  
With very small stones indeed;  
They are brought by little dwarfs--  
So small that to be a man's size  
They have to climb on each other's backs.  
But tell me, O friend of the King, <span id="fr_55"></span>[2](#fn_55)

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

Why art thou in such long clothes,  
Trailing like the wings of a sick bird <span
id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56)--  
As they are black it is better.  
  *Rumi-ñaui*. Hast thou not seen already  
That Cuzco is plunged in grief?  
The great Inca Pachacuti <span id="fr_57"></span>[2](#fn_57) is dead,  
All the people are in mourning,  
Every soul is shedding tears.  
  *Piqui Chaqui*. Who, then, succeeds to the place  
Which Pachacuti has left vacant?  
If Tupac Yupanqui succeeds,  
That Prince is the youngest  
There are some others older. <span id="fr_58"></span>[3](#fn_58)  
  *Rumi-ñaui*. All Cuzco has elected him,  
For the late king chose him,  
Giving him the royal fringe;  
We could elect no other.  
  *Piqui Chaqui*. I hasten to bring my bed here. <span
id="fr_59"></span>[4](#fn_59)

\[*Exit running*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_53"></span>[379:1](oll12.htm#fr_53) Rumi-ñaui is the
interlocutor in the *Justiniani* text, in the *Dominican* text, and in
the text of *Spilsbury*. Yet Zegarra would substitute the Uillac Uma or
High Priest for Rumi-ñaui. His argument is that the interlocutor was of
the blood-royal, and that the High Priest was always of the blood-royal,
while Rumi-ñaui was not. But the text does not say that the interlocutor
was of the royal blood. Zegarra also says that the interlocutor wore a
black cloak with a long train, and that this was the dress of the High
Priest. But it was not the dress of the High Priest as described by the
best authorities. It was probably the general mourning dress. The
threats addressed to Piqui Chaqui were likely enough to come from a
soldier, but not from the High Priest as he is portrayed in this drama.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[380:1](oll12.htm#fr_54) *Paccay* (*mimosa
incana*), a tree with large pods, having a snow-white woolly substance
round the seeds, with sweet juice.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[380:2](oll12.htm#fr_55) The Zegarra and
Spilsbury texts have *Ccan Incacri*, which Zegarra translates, 'relation
of the Inca, of the royal family.' Spilsbury is more correct. He has
'partisan of the Inca.' The more authentic Justiniani text has *Ccan
Paña*. The particle *ri* is one of emphasis or repetition. It does not
mean a relation.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[381:1](oll12.htm#fr_56) The Zegarra and
Spilsbury texts have *hualpa*, a game bird. The Justiniani text has
*anca*, an eagle, which is the correct reading.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[381:2](oll12.htm#fr_57) The Inca Pachacuti does
not appear to advantage in the drama. But he was the greatest man of his
dynasty, indeed the greatest that the red race has produced. He was a
hero in his youth, a most able administrator in mature age. As a very
old man some needless cruelties are reported of him which annoyed his
son.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[381:3](oll12.htm#fr_58) The eldest son was
Amaru Tupac. He was passed over by his father with his own consent, and
was ever faithful to his younger brother. He was an able general.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[381:4](oll12.htm#fr_59) This was exactly what
Piqui Chaqui was sent to Cuzco to find out. The expression *Apumusac
puñunayta*, 'I go to fetch my bed,' is one of joy at any fortunate
event, in Quichua.
