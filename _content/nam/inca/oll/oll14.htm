<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rumi-&ntilde;aui</i>. Will no one here have pity on me?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>One of the Guards</i>. Who art thou, man?<br> Who has ill-treated thee?<br> Thou comest in a frightful state,<br> Covered with blood and gaping wounds.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rumi-&ntilde;aui</i>. Go quickly to thy king and say<br> That one he loves has come to him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>One of the Guards</i>. Thy name?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rumi-&ntilde;aui</i>. There is no need to give a name.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>One of the Guards</i>. Wait here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rumi-&ntilde;aui</i>. A thousand times I thee salute,<br> Ollantay, great and puissant king!<br> Have pity on a fugitive<br> Who seeks a refuge here with thee.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Who art thou, man? Approach nearer.<br> Who has thus ill-treated thee?<br> Were such deep and fearful wounds<br> Caused by a fall, or what mishap?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rumi-&ntilde;aui</i>. Thou knowest me, O mighty chief.<br> I am that stone that fell down once,<br> But now I fall before thy feet;<br> O Inca! mercy! Raise me up!</p><dir> <dir>  
<p>(<i>Kneels</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Art thou the noble Rumi-&ntilde;aui,<br> Great Chief and Lord of Hanan-suyu?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rumi-&ntilde;aui</i>. Yes, I was that well-known Chief--<br> A bleeding fugitive to-day.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Rise, comrade mine. Let us embrace.</p><dir> <dir>  
<p>(<i>Rises</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
<p>Who has dared to treat thee thus,<br> And who has brought thee here to me<br> Within my fortress, on my hearth?</p><dir> <dir>  
<p>(<i>To attendants</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
<p>Bring new clothes for my oldest friend.</p> 
<p align="RIGHT">[<i>Exit an attendant</i>.</p> 
<p>How is it that thou art alone?<br> Camest thou not fearing death?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rumi-&ntilde;aui</i>. A new king reigns in Cuzco now--<br> Tupac Yupanqui is installed.<br> Against the universal wish,<br> He rose upon a wave of blood;<br> Safety he sees in headless trunks,</p>

Grieve not, old friend Rumi-&ntilde;aui,<br> Thy wounds before all must be cured;<br> I see in thee th' avenging knife,<br> To use against the tyrant's heart.<br> At Tampu now we celebrate<br> The Sun's great Raymi festival;<br> On that day all who love my name,<br> Throughout my realms hold festival.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rumi-&ntilde;aui</i>. Those three days of festival<br> To me will be a time of joy,<br> Perhaps I may be healed by then,<br> So that my heart may pleasure seek.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. It will be so. For three whole nights<br> We drink and feast, to praise the Sun,<br> The better to cast all care aside<br> We shall be shut in Tampu fort.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Rumi-&ntilde;aui</i>. The youths, as is their wont, will find<br> Their great delight in those three nights,<br> Then will they rest from all their toils,<br> And carry off the willing girls.</p>
