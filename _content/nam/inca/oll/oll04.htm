<p>An open space near the junction of the two torrents of Cuzco, the Huatanay and Tullumayu or Rodadero, called Pumap Chupan, just outside the gardens of the Sun.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Where, young fleet-foot, hast thou been?<br> Hast thou the starry &Ntilde;usta seen?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. The Sun forbids such sacrilege<br> 'Tis not for me to see the star.<br> Dost thou, my master, fear no ill,<br> Thine eyes upon the Inca's child?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. In spite of all I swear to love<br> That tender dove, that lovely star;<br> My heart is as a lamb&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with her,<br> And ever will her presence seek.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. Such thoughts are prompted by Supay&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>;<br> That evil being possesses thee.<br> All round are beauteous girls to choose<br> Before old age, and weakness come.<br> If the great Inca knew thy plot<br> And what thou seekest to attain,<br> Thy head would fall by his command,<br> Thy body would be quickly burnt.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Boy, do not dare to cross me thus.<br> One more such word and thou shalt die.<br> These hands will tear thee limb from limb,<br> If still thy councils are so base.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. Well! treat thy servant as a dog,<br> But do not night and day repeat,<br> 'Piqui Chaqui! swift of foot!<br> Go once more to seek the star.'<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Have I not already said<br> That e'en if death's fell scythe&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> was here,<br> If mountains should oppose my path<br> Like two fierce foes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> who block the way,<br> Yet will I fight all these combined<br> And risk all else to gain my end,<br> And whether it be life or death<br> I'll cast myself at Coyllur's feet.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. If thou shouldst only see his nose,<br> Thou wouldst not speak as thou dost now.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Now, Piqui Chaqui, speak the truth,<br> Seek not evasion or deceit.<br> Dost thou not already know,<br> Of all the flowers in the field,<br> Not one can equal my Princess?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. Still, my master, thou dost rave.<br> I think I never saw thy love.<br> Stay! was it her who yesterday<br> Came forth with slow and faltering steps<br> And sought a solitary&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> path&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>?<br> If so, 'tis true she's like the sun,<br> The moon less beauteous than her face.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. It surely was my dearest love.<br> How beautiful, how bright is she<br> This very moment thou must go<br> And take my message to the Star.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. I dare not, master; in the day,<br> 1 fear to pass the palace gate.<br> With all the splendour of the court,<br> I could not tell her from the rest.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Didst thou not say thou sawest her?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. I said so, but it was not sense.<br> A star can only shine at night<br> Only at night could I be sure.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Begone, thou lazy good-for-nought.<br> The joyful star that I adore,<br> If placed in presence of the Sun,<br> Would shine as brightly as before.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. Lo! some person hither comes,<br> Perhaps an old crone seeking alms;<br> Yes!

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. Silence, master, do not speak,<br> The old man doubly is informed;<br> Fore-knowing every word you say,<br> Already he has guessed it all.</p> 
<p>(He lies down on a bank.)</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i> (<i>aside</i>). He sees me. I must speak to him.</p><dir> <dir>  
<p>(<i>The </i>Uillac Uma<i> comes forward</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
<p>O Uillac Uma, Great High Priest,<br> I bow before thee with respect<br> May the skies be clear for thee,<br> And brightest sunshine meet thine eyes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Uillac Uma</i>. Brave Ollantay! Princely one!<br> May all the teeming land be thine;<br> May thy far-reaching arm of might<br> Reduce the wide-spread universe.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Old man! thine aspect causes fear,<br> Thy presence here some ill forebodes;<br> All round thee dead men's bones appear,<br> Baskets, flowers, sacrifice.<br> All men when they see thy face<br> Are filled with terror and alarm.<br> What means it all? why comest thou?<br> It wants some months before the least.<br> Is it that the Inca is ill?<br> Perchance hast thou some thought divined<br> Which soon will turn to flowing blood.<br> Why comest thou? the Sun's great day,<br> The Moon's libations are not yet<br> The moon has not yet nearly reached<br> The solemn time for sacrifice.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Uillac Uma</i>. Why dost thou these questions put,<br> In tones of anger and reproach?</p> 
<p><a name="page_346"><font size="1" color="green">p. 346</font></A></p> 
<p>Am I, forsooth, thy humble slave?<br> That I know all I'll quickly prove.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. My beating heart is filled with dread,<br> Beholding thee so suddenly;<br> Perchance thy coming is a sign,<br> Of evils overtaking me.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Uillac Uma</i>. Fear not, Ollantay! not for that,<br> The High Priest comes to thee this day.<br> It is perhaps for love of thee,<br> That, as a straw is blown by wind,<br> A friend, this day, encounters thee.<br> Speak to me as to a friend,<br> Hide nothing from my scrutiny.<br> This day I come to offer thee<br> A last and most momentous choice<br> 'Tis nothing less than life or death.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Then make thy words more clear to me,<br> That I may understand the choice<br> Till now 'tis but a tangled skein,<br> Unravel it that I may know.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Uillac Uma</i>. 'Tis well. Now listen, warlike. Chief<br> My science has enabled me,<br> To learn and see all hidden things<br> Unknown to other mortal men.<br> My power will enable me<br> To make of thee a greater prince.<br> I brought thee up from tender years,<br> And cherished thee with love and care<br> I now would guide thee in the right,<br> And ward off all that threatens thee.<br> As chief of Anti-suyu now,<br> The people venerate thy name;<br> Thy Sovereign trusts and honours thee,<br> E'en to sharing half his realm.<br> From all the rest he chose thee out,</p> 
<p><a name="page_347"><font size="1" color="green">p. 347</font></A></p> 
<p>And placed all power in thy hands;<br> He made thy armies great and strong,<br> And strengthened thee against thy foes<br> How numerous soe'er they be,<br> They have been hunted down by thee.<br> Are these good reasons for thy wish,<br> To wound thy Sovereign to the heart?<br> His daughter is beloved by thee;<br> Thy passion thou wouldst fain indulge,<br> Lawless and forbidden though it be.<br> I call upon thee, stop in time,<br> Tear this folly from thy heart.<br> If thy passion is immense,<br> Still let honour hold its place.<br> You reel, you stagger on the brink<br> I'd snatch thee from the very edge.<br> Thou knowest well it cannot be,<br> The Inca never would consent.<br> If thou didst e'en propose it now,<br> He would be overcome with rage;<br> From favoured prince and trusted chief,<br> Thou wouldst descend to lowest rank.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. How is it that thou canst surely know<br> What still is hidden in my heart?<br> Her mother only knows my love,<br> Yet thou revealest all to me.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Uillac Uma</i>. I read thy secret on the moon,<br> As if upon the Quipu knots;<br> And what thou wouldst most surely hide,<br> Is plain to me as all the rest.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. In my heart I had divined<br> That thou wouldst search me through and through<br> Thou knowest all, O Councillor,<br> And wilt thou now desert thy son?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Uillac Uma</i>. How oft we mortals heedless drink,</p> 
<p><a name="page_348"><font size="1" color="green">p. 348</font></A></p> 
<p>A certain death from golden cup<br> Recall to mind how ills befall,<br> And that a stubborn heart 's the cause.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i> (<i>kneeling</i>). Plunge that dagger in my breast,<br> Thou holdst it ready in thy belt;<br> Cut out my sad and broken heart<br> I ask the favour at thy feet.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Uillac Uma</i> (<i>to</i> Piqui Chaqui). Gather me that flower, boy.</p><dir> <dir>  
<p>(Piqui Chaqui <i>gives him a withered flower and lies down again, pretending to sleep</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
<p>(<i>To</i> Ollantay). Behold, it is quite dead and dry.<br> Once more behold! e'en now it weeps,<br> It weeps. The water flows from it.</p><dir> <dir>  
<p>(<i>Water flows out of the flower</i>.)</p></dir> </dir>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. More easy for the barren rocks<br> Or for sand to send forth water,<br> Than that I should cease to love<br> The fair princess, the joyful star.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Uillac Uma</i>. Put a seed into the ground,<br> It multiplies a hundredfold;<br> The more thy crime shall grow and swell,<br> The greater far thy sudden fall.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Once for all, I now confess<br> To thee, O great and mighty Priest;<br> Now learn my fault. To thee I speak,<br> Since thou hast torn it from my heart.<br> The lasso to tie me is long,<br> 'Tis ready to twist round my throat<br> Yet its threads are woven with gold,<br> It avenges a brilliant crime.<br> Cusi Coyllur e'en now is my wife,<br> Already we 're bound and are one;</p> 
<p><a name="page_349"><font size="1" color="green">p. 349</font></A></p> 
<p>My blood now runs in her veins,<br> E'en now I am noble as she.<br> Her mother has knowledge of all,<br> The Queen can attest what I say;<br> Let me tell all this to the King,<br> I pray for thy help and advice.<br> I will speak without fear and with force,<br> He may perhaps give way to his rage<br> Yet he may consider my youth,<br> May remember the battles I've fought;<br> The record is carved on my club.</p><dir> <dir>  
<p>(<i>Holds up his </i>macana.)</p></dir> </dir>  
<p>He may think of his enemies crushed,<br> The thousands I've thrown at his feet.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Uillac Uma</i>. Young Prince! thy words are too bold,<br> Thou hast twisted the thread of thy fate--<br> Beware, before 'tis too late;<br> Disentangle and weave it afresh,<br> Go alone to speak to the King,<br> Alone bear the blow that you seek;<br> Above all let thy words be but few,<br> And say them with deepest respect;<br> Be it life, be it death that you find,<br> I will never forget thee, my son.</p> 
<p align="RIGHT">[<i>Walks up and exit</i>.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Ollantay, thou art a man,<br> No place in thy heart for fear;<br> Cusi Coyllur, surround me with light.<br> Piqui Chaqui, where art thou?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i> (<i>jumping up</i>). I was asleep, my master,<br> And dreaming of evil things.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Of what?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. Of a fox with a rope round its neck.</p> 
<p><a name="page_350"><font size="1" color="green">p. 350</font></A></p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Sure enough, thou art the fox.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>. It is true that my nose is growing finer,<br> And my ears a good deal longer.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ollantay</i>. Come, lead me to the Coyllur.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Piqui Chaqui</i>.
