<P><A NAME="fn_53"></A><A HREF="oll12.htm#fr_53">379:1</A> Rumi-&ntilde;aui is the interlocutor in the <i>Justiniani</i> text, in the <i>Dominican</i> text, and in the text of <i>Spilsbury</i>. Yet Zegarra would substitute the Uillac Uma or High Priest for Rumi-&ntilde;aui. His argument is that the interlocutor was of the blood-royal, and that the High Priest was always of the blood-royal, while Rumi-&ntilde;aui was not. But the text does not say that the interlocutor was of the royal blood. Zegarra also says that the interlocutor wore a black cloak with a long train, and that this was the dress of the High Priest. But it was not the dress of the High Priest as described by the best authorities. It was probably the general mourning dress. The threats addressed to Piqui Chaqui were likely enough to come from a soldier, but not from the High Priest as he is portrayed in this drama.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_54"></A><A HREF="oll12.htm#fr_54">380:1</A> <i>Paccay</i> (<i>mimosa incana</i>), a tree with large pods, having a snow-white woolly substance round the seeds, with sweet juice.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_55"></A><A HREF="oll12.htm#fr_55">380:2</A> The Zegarra and Spilsbury texts have <i>Ccan Incacri</i>, which Zegarra translates, 'relation of the Inca, of the royal family.' Spilsbury is more correct. He has 'partisan of the Inca.' The more authentic Justiniani text has <i>Ccan Pa&ntilde;a</i>. The particle <i>ri</i> is one of emphasis or repetition. It does not mean a relation.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_56"></A><A HREF="oll12.htm#fr_56">381:1</A> The Zegarra and Spilsbury texts have <i>hualpa</i>, a game bird. The Justiniani text has <i>anca</i>, an eagle, which is the correct reading.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_57"></A><A HREF="oll12.htm#fr_57">381:2</A> The Inca Pachacuti does not appear to advantage in the drama. But he was the greatest man of his dynasty, indeed the greatest that the red race has produced. He was a hero in his youth, a most able administrator in mature age. As a very old man some needless cruelties are reported of him which annoyed his son.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_58"></A><A HREF="oll12.htm#fr_58">381:3</A> The eldest son was Amaru Tupac. He was passed over by his father with his own consent, and was ever faithful to his younger brother. He was an able general.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_59"></A><A HREF="oll12.htm#fr_59">381:4</A> This was exactly what Piqui Chaqui was sent to Cuzco to find out. The expression <i>Apumusac pu&ntilde;unayta</i>, 'I go to fetch my bed,' is one of joy at any fortunate event, in Quichua.</P>
