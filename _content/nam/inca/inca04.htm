<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">From: Ancient Civilizations of the Andes by Philip Ainsworth Means, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1931, pp. 437-439.</H3>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">TO VIRACOCHA</H2>
<P>Viracocha, Lord of the Universe!<BR>
Whether male or female,<BR>
at any rate commander of heat and reproduction,<BR>
being one who,<BR>
even with His spittle, can work sorcery,<BR>
Where art Thou?<BR>
Would that Thou wert not hidden from this son of Thine!<BR>
He may be above;<BR>
He may be below;<BR>
or, perchance, abroad in space.<BR>
Where is his mighty judgment-seat?<BR>
Hear me!<BR>
He may be spread abroad among the upper waters;<BR>
or, among the lower waters and their sands<BR>
He may be dwelling.<BR>
Creator of the world,<BR>
Creator of man,<BR>
great among my ancestors,<BR>
before Thee my eyes fail me,<BR>
though I long to see Thee;<BR>
for, seeing Thee,<BR>
knowing Thee,<BR>
learning from Thee,<BR>
understanding Thee,<BR>
I shall be seen by Thee,<BR>
and Thou wilt know me.<BR>
The Sun--the Moon;<BR>
The Day--the Night;<BR>
Summer--Winter;<BR>
not in vain,<BR>
in orderly succession,<BR>
do they march to their destined place,<BR>
to their goal.<BR>
They arrive<BR>
wherever<BR>
Thy royal staff<BR>
Thou bearest.<BR>
Oh! Harken to me,<BR>
listen to me,<BR>
let it not befall<BR>
that I grow weary<BR>
and die.</P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">TO VIRACOCHA</H2>
<P>O conquering Viracocha!<BR>
Ever-present Viracocha!<BR>
Thou who art without equal upon the earth!<BR>
Thou who art from the beginnings of the world until its end!<BR>
Thou gavest life and valour to men, saying,<BR>
"Let this be a man."<BR>
And to woman, saying,<BR>
"Let this be a woman."<BR>
Thou madest them and gavest them being.<BR>
Watch over them, that they may live in health and in peace.<BR>
Thou who art in the highest heavens,<BR>
and among the clouds of the tempest,<BR>
grant them long life,<BR>
and accept this our sacrifice,<BR>
O Creator.</P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">TO PACHACAMAC</H2>
<P>O Pachacamac!<BR>
Thou who hast existed from the beginning,<BR>
Thou who shalt exist until the end,<BR>
powerful but merciful,<BR>
Who didst create man by saying,<BR>
"Let man be,"<BR>
Who defendest us from evil,<BR>
and preservest our life and our health,<BR>
art Thou in the sky or upon the earth?<BR>
In the clouds or in the deeps?<BR>
Hear the voice of him who implores Thee,<BR>
and grant him his petitions.<BR>
Give us life everlasting,<BR>
preserve us, and accept this our sacrifice.</P></BODY>
