# HÓTHO (COLD)

ONE day a man who was out hunting met HÓTHO and said to him, "You cannot
freeze me, no matter bow cold you are."

"I can," said HÓTHO.

They had a long discussion and at last agreed that when night came they
would have a trial of strength.

The man went home, carried in wood enough to bum till morning, built a
huge fire and made a kettleful of hemlock tea. He stood in front of the
fire all night, turning first one side then the other toward the heat,
often drinking a cup of hot tea. It was terribly cold and grew colder
and colder till near morning.

Just at daybreak, HÓTHO, naked, his hatchet in his hip, came into the
house and sat down on a pile of bark by the fire.

"You have beaten me," said he, and that minute it began to grow warm and
thaw.

This shows that man can conquer HÓTHO.
