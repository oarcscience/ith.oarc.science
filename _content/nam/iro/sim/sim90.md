# THE TWELVE STARS

TWELVE children were playing together on the grass near their fathers'
cabins. They thought they would play a new game, and they invented one.
They joined hands in a circle and danced, not swinging around, but
standing in one place. As they danced they sang: "We are dancing. We are
dancing."

Their parents were watching them and listening to their song, when all
at once they noticed that their feet did not touch the ground. The
parents were frightened and ran out to stop the dancing, but the
children were already above their heads in the air and going higher and
higher, always singing: "We are dancing. We are dancing."

They went up and up until they disappeared, still holding hands, and
they were next seen as twelve stars in the heavens just above their
fathers' cabins. One got a little out of the circle and therefore
appears a little at one side of the others.
