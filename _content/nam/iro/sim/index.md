The Seneca are one of the members of the powerful Iroquois tribe, and
live in the western part of New York State, along the shores of Lake
Ontario to the west of the Finger Lake region. This huge (500 page) book
of Seneca myths was collected by Jeremiah Curtin at the turn of the 20th
century. Curtin also wrote [Creation Myths of Primitive
America](../../ca/cma/index), [Myths and Folk-lore of
Ireland](../../../neu/celt/mfli/index), and [Tales of the Fairies and of
the Ghost World](../../../neu/celt/tfgw/index), all also at this site.

The tales in this book are consistent in themes and style with Native
American storytelling from diverse regions. Themes such as
shape-shifting culture heroes, gambling for keeps, and journeys beyond
the sky are reminiscent of many other tales from diverse parts of the
continent. The tales are mostly set in a pre-human dreamtime, and the
players are the conventional zoomorphic first people. There are a few
legends set in more recent times, particularly regarding conflict of the
Iroquois with the neighboring Cherokee.

There are many distinctive Iroquois touches, for instance, the
importance of the uncle as opposed to the father, and the strong and
self-motivated women characters; this is an outgrowth of matrilineal
descent. Also of note are the hideous man-eaters, used as figures of
horror here. (This should not be taken as an indication that cannibals
were once prevalent, no more than Grimms' tales indicate the use of
gingerbread as a construction material in medieval northern Europe.)
These tales are very entertaining and present insights into Iroquois
psychology. There is no evidence of European contact, as is sometimes
seen in other collections, whether this was the result of editing by
Curtin is unknown. The repeated use of similar themes is never tedious,
but shows how various storytellers built on the same foundation.
