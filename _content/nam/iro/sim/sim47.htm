<p>ONE day a man who was out hunting met H&Oacute;THO and said to him, "You cannot freeze me, no matter bow cold you are."</p>  
<p>"I can," said H&Oacute;THO.</p>  
<p>They had a long discussion and at last agreed that when night came they would have a trial of strength.</p>  
<p>The man went home, carried in wood enough to bum till morning, built a huge fire and made a kettleful of hemlock tea. He stood in front of the fire all night, turning first one side then the other toward the heat, often drinking a cup of hot tea. It was terribly cold and grew colder and colder till near morning.</p>  
<p>Just at daybreak, H&Oacute;THO, naked, his hatchet in his hip, came into the house and sat down on a pile of bark by the fire.</p>  
<p>"You have beaten me," said he, and that minute it began to grow warm and thaw.</p>  
<p>This shows that man can conquer H&Oacute;THO.</p>
