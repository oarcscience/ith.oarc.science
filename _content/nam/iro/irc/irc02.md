# IROQUOIAN COSMOLOGY

###### FIRST PART

## By J. N. B. HEWITT

 

### INTRODUCTION

The term Iroquoian is derived from the name Iroquois, which, adapted
from the Algonquian Indian language by the early French explorers, was
applied originally to a group of five tribes then united in a permanent
confederacy for offense and defense, and inhabiting, the central and
eastern portions of the region now comprised within the State of New
York. Among other names they were called the Five Nations, and the
League of the Iroquois, and, after their adoption of the Tuscaroras, in
1722, the Six Nations. These five tribes attained the zenith of their
remarkable career during the latter part of the seventeenth century,
when, by the exploitation of the fundamental principles of the
constitution of their League, they dominated by force of arms the
greater part of the watershed of the Great lakes. Never very numerous,
they reached this commanding position by an incisive and unexcelled
diplomacy, by an effective political organization founded on maternal
blood relationship, both real and fictitious, and by an aptitude for
coordinate political action, all due to a mentality superior to that of
the surrounding tribes.

The sophiology,--that is, the body of opinions--of a people such as the
Iroquois is necessarily interesting and very abundant. It would be an
almost interminable work to collect these opinions exhaustively and to
publish them in a body, so in the accompanying text only narratives
relating to the genesis of things are included. The following comments
may serve to aid the scholar who would study these narratives at first
hand, giving him what the author regards, as the most apparent
viewpoints of their relators and originators:

It must not be overlooked that these texts represent largely the spoken
language of to-day, conveying the modern thought of the people, although
there are many survivals, in both word and concept from older
generations and past planes of thought. These archaisms

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

when encountered appear enigmatic and quaint, and are not understood by
the uninformed. The relators themselves often do not know the
signification of the terms they employ. The author has attempted, where
it appeared needful, to reduce evident metaphors to statements of
concrete things which gave rise originally to the figures of speech.

The attempts of a primitive people to give in the form of a narrative
the origins and to expound the causes of things, the sum of which
constitutes their philosophy, assume in time the form of cosmologic
legends or myths. In these legends are stored the combined wisdom and
speculations of their wise men, their ancients, their prophets, and
their soothsayers.

By primitive man all motions and activities were interpreted as
manifestations of life and will. Things animate and things inanimate
were comprised in one heterogeneous class, sharing a common nature. All
things, therefore, were thought to have life and to exercise will, whose
behests were accomplished through orenda--that is, through magic power,
reputed to be inherent in all things. Thus, all phenomena, all states,
all changes, and all activity were interpreted as the results of the
exercise of magic power directed by some controlling mind. The various
beings and bodies and operations of environing nature were interpreted
strictly in terms of the subjective self. Into the known world self was
projected. The wind was the breath of some person. The lightning was the
winking of some person's eyes. The generative or reproductive power in
nature was personified, and life and growth were in the, fostering care
of this personage.

Upon the concepts evolved from their impressions of things and from
their experience with the, bodies of their environment rest the
authority for men's doctrines and the reasons for their rites and core,
monies. Hence arises the great importance of recording, translating, and
interpreting from the vernacular the legends constituting the cosmology
of peoples still largely dominated by the thoughts peculiar to the
cultural stage of imputative and self-centered reasoning. The great
difficulty of accurately defining and interpreting the ideas of
primitive man without a deep and detailed study and a close translation
of the words embodying these ideas renders it imperative for their
correct apprehension that they be carefully recorded in tile vernacular,
and that there be made not only a free, but also a literal rendering of
the record, in such wise that the highly subjective thought of barbaric
man may be cast, so far as is possible, into the more objective
phraseology of science and enlightenment. By this means it is possible
to obtain a juster and more accurate comprehension and interpretation of
the thoughts and conceptions underlying and interwoven with the
cosmologic and other legends of primitive man than that obtained by the
ordinary method of recording only a free and popular version of them.

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

A fact of great importance made evident in these texts is that anthropic
persons, called man-beings in the accompanying translations, were, in
Iroquoian thought, the primal beings. They were the first to exercise
the functions and to experience the lot of their several kinds.
Sometimes these first beings have been called the prototypes of the
things of like kind which are to-day. Some of these beings were mere
fictions, figures of speech made concrete and objective. They were not
beasts, but they belonged to a rather vague class, of which man was the
characteristic type. To speak with the logicians, no other deduction
from the intension and the extension of the term oñgwe, man-being),
appears sufficiently broad to set forth the true interpretation of the
personages the narrative of whose lives and acts constitutes the subject
matter of these texts. Among these primal beings may be named Daylight,
Earthquake, Winter, Medicine, Wind, or Air, Life (germination), and
Flower. So it seems evident from this fact that beast powers, the
so-called beast gods, were not the first beings or chief actors at the
beginning of time.

Beast gods appear later. In the development of Iroquoian thought, beasts
and animals, plants and trees, rocks, and streams of water, having human
or other effective attributes or properties in a paramount measure, were
naturally regarded as the controllers of those attributes or properties,
which could be made available by orenda or magic power. And thus began
the reign of the beast gods, plant gods, tree gods, and their kind. The
signification of the Iroquoian term usually rendered into English by the
term "god" is "disposer," or "controller." This definition supplies the
reason that the reputed controllers of the operations of nature received
worship and prayers. To the Iroquois god and controller are synonymous
terms.

From the very nature of the subject-matter and the slow acquirement of
new ideas and development of concepts, the content of a cosmologic myth
or legend must be the result of a gradual combination and readjustment
of diverse materials, which, in the flux of time, are recast many times
into new forms to satisfy the growing knowledge and wider experience and
deeper research of the people among whom the myth is current. In
different branches of a cognate group of peoples the old materials, the
old ideas and concepts, modified by accultural influences and by new and
alien ideas, may be combined and arranged in quite unlike forms, and
hence arise varying versions of a cosmogonic legend. These different
versions modify the thought contemporary with them, and are in turn
still further changed by accultural influences and motives arising from
the activities of the people. And in later times, when they no longer
constitute the chief body of the philosophy of the people, these legends
and stories concerning the causes and beginnings of things are called
myths.

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

As has been suggested, the development of legend is not always internal,
from the activities of the people dealing with the materials supplied by
the legend itself, but often, and naturally from alien material, from
ideas and concepts consciously or unconsciously adopted from other
peoples. And thus older forms and concepts, the ancient dogmas, are
displaced or changed by accultural influence, and by a more definite
knowledge of nature acquired through a wider experience, a closer
observation, and a more discriminating interpretation and apprehension
of environing phenomena. Cosmologies, therefore, are composite,
representing the accumulated explanations of many things by many
generations in diverse times. The correct and fundamental analysis must
therefore seek by a wide comparison of materials to separate the
accultural from the autochthonous product. This analysis, however, can
bring to light only such material as still exhibits by some marked token
of incongruity its alien origin; for it is obvious that accultural
matter in time becomes so thoroughly assimilated and recast that a more
or less complete congruity is established between it and the cosmologic
material with which it is joined, but to which it is, in fact, alien.
Furthermore, where reason demands it, metaphor and personification must
he reduced to concrete statement of objective facts upon which the
original figurative expressions were founded; in short, the process
resulting in metaphor and personification must be carefully retraced, so
far as it may be possible so to do from the materials in hand.

It must not be overlooked that although these legends concerning the
beginnings of things are usually called myths, creation stories, or
cosmogonies, the terms myth and creation are, in fact, misnomers. In all
of these narratives, except such is are of modern date, creation in the
modern acceptation of the word is never signified, nor is it even
conceived; and when these legends or narratives are called in myths, it
is because a full comprehension and a correct interpretation of them
have to a large extent been lost or because they have been supplanted by
more accurate knowledge, and they are related without a clear conception
of what they were designed to signify, and rather from custom than as
the source of the major portion of the customs and ceremonies and
opinions in vogue among the people relating them.

Five different versions of the Iroquoian cosmology have been recorded by
the author at different times from 1889 to 1900. Of these only three
appear in the following pages, namely, one Onondaga, one Mohawk, and one
Seneca, legend.

The first text is in Onondaga version of the Iroquoian cosmology,
obtained in 1S89 on the Grand River reservation, Canada, from the late
chief and fire-keeper, John Buck, of the Onondaga tribe. Afterward, in
1897, it was revised and somewhat enlarged by the aid of Mr Joshua Buck,
a son of the first relator. It is not as long as the Mohawk

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

text printed herewith because the relator seemed averse to telling more
than a brief outline of the legend. A version in the Onondaga, much
longer and fuller than any herewith printed, has been recorded from the
mouth of Chief John Arthur Gibson, and will be printed in a later report
of the Bureau.

The second text is a Seneca version of the cosmologic legend, obtained
in 1896 on the Cattaraugus reservation, in the western part of the State
of York. from the late Mr John Armstrong, of Seneca-Delaware-English
mixed blood, an intelligent and conscientious annalist. Later, at
various times, it was revised in this office with the assistance of Mr
Andrew John.

The last text in order is a Mohawk version, obtained in 1896 and 1897 on
the Grand River reservation in Canada from Mr Seth Newhouse, an
intelligent and educated member of the Mohawk tribe.

In general outlines the legend, as related here, is identical with that
found among all of the northern tribes of the Iroquoian stock of
languages. It is told partly in the language of tradition and ceremony,
which is formal, sometimes quaint, sometimes archaic, frequently
mystical, and largely metaphorical. But the figures of speech are made
concrete by the elementary thought of the Iroquois, and the metaphor is
regarded as a fact.

Regarding the subject-matter of these texts, it may be said that it is
in the main of aboriginal origin. The most marked post-Columbian
modification is found in the portion relating to the formation of the
physical bodies of man and of the animals and plants, in that relating
to the idea of a hell, and in the adaptation of the rib story from the
ancient Hebrew mythology in connection with the creation of woman. These
alien elements are retained in the texts to show by concrete examples
how such foreign material may be adopted and recast to conform to the
requirements of its new setting. In the translation some of the
quaintness of the original is retained, as well as some of its seeming
tautology. No liberty, however, has been taken with the text, either in
the way of emendation or addition or in rendering them into English.
They are given exactly is related. It may possibly be objected that the
interlinear and the free translations are too literal; but the
aboriginal thought, however commonplace, figurative, poetical, is set
forth as simply and with as strict a rendering of the original as the
matter and thought contained in it permit. It is no ready task to embody
in the language of enlightenment the thought of barbarism. The viewpoint
of the one plane of thought differs much from that of the other.

The idea that the bodies of man and of the animals were created directly
out of specific portions of the earth by Tharonhiawakon <span
id="fr_0"></span>[a](#fn_0) is a comparatively modern and erroneous
interpretation of the original

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

concept. The error is due largely to the influence of the declaration of
like import in the Semitic mythology found in the Hebrew Scriptures, the
figurative character of which is usually not apprehended. The thought
originally expressed by the ancient teachers of the Iroquoian and other
barbaric peoples was that the earth through the life, or life power,
innate and immanent in its substance--the life personated by
Tharonhiawakon <span id="fr_1"></span>[a](#fn_1)--by feeding itself to
them produces plants and fruits and vegetables which serve as food for
birds and animals, all which in their turn become food for men, a
process whereby the life of the earth is transmuted into that of man and
of all living things. Hence. the Iroquois consistently say, in
addressing the earth, "Eithinoha," "our Mother." Thus in 1896 the
authors late friend, Mr David Stephens, a grave Seneca priest and
philosopher, declared to him that the earth or ground is living matter,
and that the tender plantlet of the bean and the sprouting germ of the
corn nestling therein receive through their delicate rootlets the life
substance from the earth; that, thus, the earth indeed feeds itself to
them; that, since what is supplied to them is living matter, life in
them is produced and conserved, and that as food the ripened corn and
bean and their kinds, thus produced, create and develop the life of man
and of all living things. Hence it is seen that only in this
metaphorical manner Tharonhiawakon, the personified life immanent in the
matter of the earth, creates daily, and did in the beginning of time
create man find all living things out of the earth. But the fiat
creation of man and things from nothing or from definite portions of
clay or earth, as the potter makes pottery, never is involved in the
earliest known conceptions of the beginning of things. In the quaint
protology, or science of first things, of the Iroquois things are
derived from things through transformation and evolution. The manner in
which the earth or dry land itself was formed, as detailed in the
Onondaga and the Mohawk texts, is an apt example of this statement.

Another misapprehended figure of speech is expressed in the popular
dogma of the virgin, or parthenogenetic, conception, which in this, as
in other cosmologies, affects one of the chief persons. This is,
however, a metaphor as old as the earliest philosophies of man. And some
of the most beautiful and touching thoughts and activities of both
barbaric and enlightened man rest on the too literal acceptation of the
figurative statement of a great fact of life, attested by all human
experience, namely, that breath (spirit, air, wind, atmos, atman) is the
principle of life and feeling, and that without it there can be no
manifestation of life. This is the key to the riddle of the virgin. or
parthenogenetic, conception. It is made very clear in the

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Onondaga version. The fact and the idea are
matters of experience in all times and in all lands.

While in general outlines and in the sum of incidents comprised in them
the several versions of the cosmologic story of the Iroquois
substantially accord, there are nevertheless marked divergences in both
structure and matter, which in time, by further development from
accultural and other potent causes, would necessarily cause them to be
regarded as quite different legends in source and meaning; and this
emphasizes the great and fundamental fact that all legends are the
gradual result of combination from many sources by many minds in many
generations.

Most of the characteristic incidents related in these legends are widely
prevalent over the American continent, occurring among peoples speaking
tongues of widely different linguistic stocks and dwelling in widely
separated habitats. It should not be assumed that these coincidences are
indubitably due to accultural influences, but rather that they indicate
universality of the natural phenomena from which the incidents, embodied
are drawn. Among these coincidences may be mentioned that of the
seclusion of the members of the animal world in a vast cavern by one of
the chief characters of the legends, Winter, the man-being of frosts and
snow and ice. This episode evidently portrays the annual hibernation of
the animals and insects and the migration of the birds caused by the
winter power, which is called Tawiskaron by the Mohawks, <span
id="fr_2"></span>[a](#fn_2) Ohaä by the Onondagas, and Othä’kwenda’ by
the Senecas.

The author desires to acknowledge his many obligations to the officers
and staff of the Bureau of American Ethnology, for most kindly advice,
wise counsel, and many valuable suggestions, especially to the late
Director, Major John Wesley Powell; to Professor W J McGee, formerly
Ethnologist in Charge; to Professor William Henry Holmes. the present
Chief of the Bureau, and to Herbert Spencer Wood, editor, who has also
kindly performed the irksome task of correcting the proofs of the texts
and translations while they were passing through the press.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[137:a](irc02.htm#fr_0) "He grasps the sky (by
memory)."

<span id="fn_1"></span>[138:a](irc02.htm#fr_1) He is also called
Odendonnia, Sprout, or Sapling, and Ioskaha, having apparently the same
meaning.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[139:a](irc02.htm#fr_2) The Mohawk epithet is
commonly interpreted "flint," but its literal and original meaning
"crystal-clad" or "ice-clad," the two significations being normal, as
crystal, flint and ice have a similar aspect and fracture. The original
denotation is singularly appropriate for Winter. The last two names do
not connote ice, but simply denote flint.
