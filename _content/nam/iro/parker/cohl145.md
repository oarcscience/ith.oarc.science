The object of the Cornplanting ceremony is to secure divine favor and
help in the spring planting. Everyone is invoked to till the ground and
earn the bread they eat. The ceremony lasts about four or five hours.

### THE MAPLE FESTIVAL

A council is called to set the time for this festival which has no exact
day but varies according to the weather. However, it takes place soon
after the sap commences to run. Its object is to thank all trees for
their services to man and invoke their protection and good will for the
coming year.

Outline program

I The address to the maple tree. A fire is built at the foot of a large
maple tree. The people gather around and a special officer advances with
a basket of tobacco which he sprinkles on the fire as he recites the
address to the maple:

The address to the maple, the chief of trees and the prayer to the
Creator

A Seneca ceremony

The priest stands at the roots of a maple. A fire is burning and the
priest casts tobacco in the fire and as its smoke arises he says:

To the tree:

O partake of this incense,  
You the forests!  
We implore you  
To continue as before,  
The flowing waters of the maple.

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

To the Creator and the tree:

It is the will of the Creator  
That a certain tree  
Should flow such water.  
Now may no accidents occur  
To children roaming in the forests.  
Now this day is yours  
May you enjoy it,--this day.

To the Creator:

We give thanks, oh God, to you,  
You who dwell in heaven.  
We have done our duty  
You have seen us do it.  
So it is done."
