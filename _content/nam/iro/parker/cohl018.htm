<P>"'Now another message.</P>
<P>"'Go tell your people that the Great Ruler is sad because of what people do.</P>
<P>"'The Creator has made it so that the married should live together and that children should grow from them.</P>
<P>"'Now it often happens that it is only a little while when people are married that the husband speaks evil of his wife because he does not wish to care for her children. Now a man who does that stirs up trouble with his wife and soon deserts her and his children. Then he searches for another woman and when he has found her he marries her. Then when he finds her with child he goes away from her and leaves her alone. Again he looks for another woman and when he has lived with her for a time and sees her growing large, he deserts her, the third woman.</P>
<P>"'Now this is true. We, the messengers, saw him leave the two women and the Creator himself saw him desert the third and punished him. Now a sure torment in the after life is for him who leaves two women with child but the Creator alone knows what the punishment is for the man who leaves the third.'"</P>
<P>So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.</P>
