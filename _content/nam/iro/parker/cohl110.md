### SECTION 99

"Now they approached a great lodge. It seemed constructed of iron that
had been highly heated and allowed to cool. Within the building hot
vapor was rising from the fire pits.

"Now the messengers spoke saying, 'Let us tarry here a while.' Then one
of the beings took from his bosom a crystal and pointed it at the lodge.
He approached holding the glass at arm's length and as he came near the
lodge arose to the height of the man so powerful was the crystal."
