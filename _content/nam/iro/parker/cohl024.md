### SECTION 13

"'Now another message.

"'This concerns a certain thing that human creatures follow. It is
concerning gakno\`we'haat. Some men desire constant new experience, that
is some men are always following ye:'o<sup>n</sup>?. Now it is a great
evil for men to have such desires. This is a thing that the so sinful
must confess. A man who desires to know gagwe:go<sup>n</sup>
ye:'o<sup>n</sup>?sho' will never be satisfied, for ye:'o<sup>n</sup>?,
will arise whom he can not know and he will fall flat. Now we, the
messengers, say that all this is sinful and men must not follow such
desires.'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.
