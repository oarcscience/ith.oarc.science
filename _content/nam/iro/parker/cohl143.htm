<P>Gwa! Gwa! Gwa!<BR>
So now this is the appointed time! Oh listen, you who dwell in the sky!</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Our words are straight--<BR>
Only these can we speak unto you,<BR>
Oh you from whom we are descended,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky!<BR>
You look down upon us and know that we are all children.<BR>
Now we petition you as we burn this sacred tobacco!<BR>
Now we commence our invocation,<BR>
Now we speak of all that you have created.<BR>
Now [in the beginning] you did think that men-beings should inherit the blessings of your creations,<BR>
For you did say, "Earth was my birthplace!<BR>
Now we have spoken in this incense [throws tobacco upon the flames].<BR>
Oh now inhale the smoke, so listen to our words.<BR>
Now we commence, we are all that remain upon the earth.<BR>
You behold the places that once were filled but now are empty;<BR>
We were unable to change it for you made the law.<BR>
Now you think that there should be two conditions of temperature upon the earth;<BR>
One you thought should be cold and one should be warm<BR>
And when the warm season came that Diohe`'ko, our substance, should spring from the bosom of Earth, our mother.<BR>
Now we have harvested the Diohe`'ko from whence our living is<BR>
For the warm season has gone and we have here assembled.<BR>
Now we have made inquiries among all the people and they remember their promises,<BR>
For they promised you that they should assemble again at Gaiwanos'kwa gowa'<BR>
On the fifth sun of the moon N&icirc;skow&ucirc;k'n&icirc;.<BR>
So all fulfilled the plan and gathered together in the moon N&icirc;s'a, even those here present,<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth, yet dwell in the sky!<BR>
Now all have fulfilled the law, for you did plan that the rites should be perpetuated even forever.<BR>
Now we are commencing, Oh you who were born of Earth!<BR>
Upon the first day the Great Feather dance went through the village for your pleasure.<BR>
The honon'diont and their cousins did their full duty.<BR>
Now on the next day Gane:o` was celebrated; at midday they went through the village,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_87"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 87</FONT></A></P>
<P>And you did give us great joy because we performed this ceremony.<BR>
For you did think that Gane:o' should be celebrated upon the earth for thine own self.<BR>
Thus did we fulfil your desires, Oh you who were born of Earth, yet live in the sky!<BR>
Now on the next day Gagandot was played.<BR>
Truly we did fulfil your desires,<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth, you who live in the sky!<BR>
You did see all that was done,<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth, you who live in the sky!<BR>
In the beginning you thought that you would lay this sacred tobacco by man's side<BR>
That men should have an incense with which to send his words up to the sky,<BR>
With which to lift his words when the year ended.<BR>
Truly we have fulfilled your desires and here we have that basket of sacred tobacco,<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth, you who dwell in the sky!<BR>
[Throws tobacco on the flames.]<BR>
So now the smoke arises!<BR>
Oh inhale the incense as you listen!<BR>
For now do we commence to speak of what you have created.<BR>
In the beginning you thought that there should be a world<BR>
Upon which men beings should travel<BR>
That you might say, "They are my descendants."<BR>
Now there is a shaft that reaches up to you, Ganeowi, the sacred song of the morning it is.<BR>
Now of your descendants as many as remain are gathered here.<BR>
Now you thought that there should be two sexes of men-beings,<BR>
That one should be the male and one should be the female,<BR>
And the function of the female should be the rearing of children.<BR>
Truly the females are fulfilling the design of their creation<BR>
For in their arms we see their children.<BR>
Truly it is in progress what you planned for them.<BR>
Now the smoke arises!<BR>
So now inhale this sacred incense!<BR>
Now we petition you that this thing should continue so henceforth,<BR>
And shall continue as long as the earth endures.<BR>
Now you thought that there should be a world<BR>
Upon which grasses of different kinds should grow</P>
<P><A NAME="page_88"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 88</FONT></A></P>
<P>And that some should be medicinal,<BR>
And that some should yield fruits for a help to the men-beings who dwell upon the earth.<BR>
Thus did you think, O you who dwell in the sky!<BR>
Now it was ordered to be so when the warm season warmed the earth<BR>
And that it should be fulfilled them and that your descendants should see the return of things.<BR>
Now again the smoke arises<BR>
And the people speak through it to you,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky!<BR>
Now we implore you that it may so occur again when the earth warms,<BR>
That your desires may be fulfilled and that your descendants may again see your creations.<BR>
Now again the smoke arises<BR>
And the people speak through it to you,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky<BR>
Yet were born of Earth!</P>
<P>Now our sustenance you thought should be placed beside us,<BR>
And that men-beings should labor for their living.<BR>
These plans are all in progress<BR>
All see from whence their living comes.<BR>
Now we implore you that when the earth warms again that sustaining food may grow.<BR>
This we ask by the power of the incense tobacco,<BR>
Oh inhale it and listen to us,<BR>
Oh you, our great ancestor,<BR>
You who dwell in the sky!</P>
<P>You thought that there should be veins and that there should be fountains of water;<BR>
Now this thought is made a fact and is occurring<BR>
So we ask that this shall continue.<BR>
Now again the smoke arises<BR>
To you the father of all men-beings,<BR>
To you who dwell in the sky!</P>
<P>Now you thought that there should be living creatures,<BR>
Inhabiting the waters, useful to the people.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_89"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 89</FONT></A></P>
<P>Now your thoughts have happened and we implore you that it may not be withdrawn,<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky!<BR>
But may continue as long as earth endures.</P>
<P>So now another.<BR>
You did think that there should be world<BR>
And that bushes should grow upon it for a help to the people,<BR>
That the bushes should yield various fruits for the benefit of men-beings,<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky,<BR>
May this continue as long as earth endures!</P>
<P>Now again the smoke arises,<BR>
Oh inhale the incense and continue to listen<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky!</P>
<P>So now another.<BR>
Now you did think that there should be forests upon the earth<BR>
And that they might be a help to the people.<BR>
So now moreover you did think that there should be a certain tree<BR>
That should yield sweet water from its trunk.<BR>
Now that tree is the Maple and it is faithful to its design<BR>
May this continue to be,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky!</P>
<P>Now again the smoke arises,<BR>
And the people pray that this may still continue when the earth becomes warm again!<BR>
So now this thing is done.<BR>
Our words are as straight as we could make them.<BR>
Only this can we do for we are all young<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky!<BR>
So now this one thing ends.</P>
<P>So now another.<BR>
You have created wild animals that roam in the forests,<BR>
You did think that they would be a pleasure to men-beings</P>
<P><A NAME="page_90"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 90</FONT></A></P>
<P>Who should remember and say, "We are his descendants."<BR>
Now may they continue so to be,<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky!</P>
<P>So now another.<BR>
The people are speaking;<BR>
They are continuing from the commencement of creation<BR>
Discussing those things that you didst think would be a benefit to men-beings,<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky!</P>
<P>Now the birds that inhabit the air,<BR>
Birds from the low world to the great birds,<BR>
Birds that float above the clouds.<BR>
All these you did think would be a benefit to mankind.<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky!<BR>
Now we ask that this thought should be forever<BR>
Even as long as earth endures.</P>
<P>Now again the smoke arises,<BR>
Continue to listen as you inhale this incense,<BR>
For we are discussing the things of your creation<BR>
That you did think should be a benefit to mankind,<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky!<BR>
Now you did think that there should be a world and that it should become cold,<BR>
At a recurring season become cold again.<BR>
Now we implore thee that it should not be too great a cold<BR>
And likewise when the earth becomes warm again,<BR>
That the heat should be moderate and comfortable.<BR>
Now again the smoke arises<BR>
To you who were born of Earth,<BR>
To you who dwell in the sky!</P>
<P>So now another.<BR>
Continue to listen!<BR>
You did think that there should be a wind<BR>
And that it should be a help to the world.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_91"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 91</FONT></A></P>
<P>Now the wind is here.<BR>
And the people pray that it may continue to be so as long as earth endures.</P>
<P>Now again the smoke arises<BR>
To you who were born of Earth,<BR>
To you who dwell in the sky!<BR>
Now they came from the west. Ti'so:t we call them,<BR>
Our great grandfathers the Thunderers;<BR>
You did make them our relatives.<BR>
They were placed in a high position<BR>
That they might care for the earth<BR>
And feed the waters that flow over the world and purify them,<BR>
And freshen all things that grow.<BR>
A certain season was appointed for their activity<BR>
The season when the earth commences to become warm again.<BR>
Now again the smoke arises,<BR>
It lifts our words to you,<BR>
Oh inhale the incense and continue to listen,<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky!<BR>
Now the whole world prays that you will listen,<BR>
May all these things continue as long as earth endures,<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky!</P>
<P>So now again another.<BR>
You did think that there should be a sky<BR>
And that within it should be something to illuminate the world,<BR>
&Ecirc;nde:'ka g&auml;&auml;`'kwa, our great brother, the mighty warrior, the Sun,<BR>
And that so it should be called so.<BR>
He has a high position that shall last as long as earth endures.<BR>
Now again the smoke arises and so smoke tobacco as you listen,<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky!<BR>
Now the people of all earth with one voice implore you<BR>
That your plan may be carried out and continue as long as earth endures,<BR>
So do your descendants pray.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_92"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 92</FONT></A></P>
<P>So now another.<BR>
It is of Soi'ka: g&auml;&auml;`'kwa, our grandmother, the Moon in the sky.<BR>
You did make her a sign for reckoning the years of children.<BR>
Now she has fulfilled the design of her creation so far.<BR>
Now again the smoke arises.<BR>
Inhale the incense as you continue to listen,<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky!<BR>
Through the smoke we pray that this may be so as long as earth endures,<BR>
So pray your descendants,<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky!<BR>
So have they said,<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky!</P>
<P>Now you did think that there should be a sky<BR>
And that spots should be in the sky<BR>
For signs unto the people.<BR>
So did you design this to be so as long as the earth endures.<BR>
And the people implore thee that this may continue to be as long as the earth endures.<BR>
Now again the smoke arises,<BR>
And through it the people speak.<BR>
Oh inhale as you continue to listen,<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky!<BR>
Now you did design all that which should occur in the world,<BR>
And planned the four sacred ceremonies<BR>
That should be perpetuated forever<BR>
And celebrated by the people each year.<BR>
Be celebrated by these who call themselves your descendants,<BR>
That there should be head ones and their assistants<BR>
To perpetuate the four ceremonies.<BR>
Now as many men-beings as remain on earth are here,<BR>
Gathered about this pole.<BR>
Now then you have seen that we commenced at the new part of day.<BR>
Now you shall know that you are invited to listen to thanking songs this day!</P>
<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman" SIZE=2><P>[The head chief yells Yokadi!, Gowagannie!<BR>
The people answer wo? wo? wo?!]</P>
<P><A NAME="page_93"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 93</FONT></A></P>
<P>Now tomorrow morning you must consider yourself invited to the Great Feather Dance!</P>
<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman" SIZE=2><P>[Cries by the head chief Hioh, hiu, hiu, hiu!<BR>
The People answer Io? io? io? io? io?!]</P>
<P>Two parts will be celebrated, the Great Feather Dance and the Harvest Thanksgiving.</P>
<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman" SIZE=2><P>[Cries by the head chief; Ganio ganio ganio!<BR>
Answers by the people Ho-ni ho-ni!]</P>
<P>These two ceremonies will be in progress tomorrow,<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky<BR>
And the next day you are: invited to the sacred game.</P>
<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman" SIZE=2><P>[Cries by the head chief, Ba-a?! ba-a?! ba-a?! ba-a?! ba-a?!<BR>
Answers by the people, Hoie! hoie! hoie! hoie!]</P>
<P>Now again the smoke arises<BR>
The incense of the sacred tobacco,<BR>
To you who were born of Earth,<BR>
Yet dwell in the sky<BR>
Only this can we do<BR>
To fulfil the law.<BR>
All the things of your creation that you have made visible to us<BR>
We thank you for and for all the things that you have created.<BR>
In the manner that you did think, we have thanked you,<BR>
From low earth upward to the great sky where you are living.<BR>
With all their strength the people thank you and you have seen it,<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky!<BR>
So now it is done.<BR>
Now you did think that you would appoint four messengers whose work should be to watch over earth<BR>
And the people that dwell in the world<BR>
To keep them all from harm,<BR>
For men-beings are your children.<BR>
Now do I say, the voices of the people combine as one<BR>
To thank you.<BR>
We have done as best we can in giving thanks to the four messengers.<BR>
Now again-the smoke arises,<BR>
And we speak through its incense.<BR>
Inhale the smoke as you do listen.<BR>
Oh the great Handsome Lake!</P>
<P><A NAME="page_94"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 94</FONT></A></P>
<P>We believe that he is happy in the place that you have prepared for him.<BR>
Moreover we thank him.<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky!<BR>
Now only this can we do.<BR>
You thought that it should be this way,<BR>
Oh you that were born of Earth,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky!<BR>
Now we thank you, the Creator of the World.<BR>
Here are gathered so many people as remain,<BR>
Few head men remain.<BR>
Only this can we do, .<BR>
And they say how the people should act.<BR>
Of the head men and their cousins only so many are left,<BR>
[But they with] the men and the women<BR>
The children that run and the children that creep<BR>
As one man-being offer you thanks.<BR>
They are your descendants,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky!<BR>
Now you did think that we should offer you tobacco when we addressed you.<BR>
And we have fulfilled your request and used tobacco.<BR>
We leave our words with you until the next great thanksgiving,<BR>
Until then may the people continue in health.<BR>
Now the smoke arises!<BR>
Oh inhale as you do listen!<BR>
Only this can we do<BR>
For all the words are spoken<BR>
To you, our great ancestor,<BR>
Oh you who dwell in the sky.<BR>
Oh you who were born of Earth!</P>
