### SECTION 112

"Then they went out upon the narrow road and had not gone far upon it
when a far more brilliant light appeared. It was then that they smelled
the fragrant odors of the flowers along the road. Delicious looking
fruits were growing on the wayside and every kind of bird flew in the
air above them. The most marvelous and beautiful things were on every
hand. And all these things were on the heaven road." Eniaiehuk.
