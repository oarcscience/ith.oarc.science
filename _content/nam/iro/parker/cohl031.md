## Recitation of the Second Day

### SECTION 20

"'Now another message.

"'A way that was followed.

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

"'Sometimes a mother is ready to feed her family. When she is ready to
bid them sit down, she glances out and sees some one coming and
straightway hides the food. A woman visitor comes in. Now after some
conversation the visitor says she is unwell and goes out. Then the
family commences to eat. And the Creator says that who follow such
tricks must repent as soon as they hear this message, for such practices
are most wicked.'

"Now the messengers said this."

"'Now the Creator made food for all creatures and it must be free for
all. He ordained that people should live in communities. Now when
visitors enter a lodge the woman must always say, "Sede'konî?'"," *come
eat*. Now it is not right to refuse what is offered. The visitor must
take two or three bites at least and say, "Niawê<sup>n</sup>'." Tell
this to all your people.'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.
