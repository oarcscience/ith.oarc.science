### SECTION 98

"Now again they told him that they would take up their journey and as
they went they drew near to the house of the punisher. As they went over
the broad road they walked well on the sides for the path was very
stony. Now, strange, this was true; some great force seemed pushing them
onward toward the house of the punisher. <span

soon they heard the far away echoes of mournful cries borne on the
blasts of the hot wind. At times the air was suffocating and the cries
of the doomed were distressing."
