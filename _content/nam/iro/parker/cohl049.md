### SECTION 38

"'Now another message for your people.

"'If all the world would repent the earth would become as new again.
Because of sin the under-world <span id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_42) is
crumbling with decay. The world is full of sin. Truly, this is so.'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_42"></span>[43:2](cohl049.htm#fr_42) The under-world was
thought to be a dark region beneath the surface of the earth where were
confined the creations of the evil-minded spirit. It was a vast cave
full of winding chambers, dark turbid rivers, bottomless sloughs, hot
springs and fetid odors, rapacious beasts, venomous serpents, Poisonous
insects and noxious weeds. The door of the under-world was guarded by
the under-earth elves who had great difficulty in preventing the white
buffaloes from escaping. Frequently they did and then began a great
pursuit to kill or bring back the white buffaloes. At such a time the
elves would tell the sun of the calamity and he would paint his face red
as a sign to all the elves the world over that the chase was on. See
Legend, Origin of Death Dance.
