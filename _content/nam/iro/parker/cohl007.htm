<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE SICK MAN</H3>
<P>And now furthermore a man becomes sick. Some strong power holds him.</P>
<P>Now as he lies in sickness he meditates and longs that he might rise again and walk upon the earth. So he implores the Great Ruler to give him strength that he may walk upon this earth again. And then he thinks how evil and loathsome he is before the Great Ruler. He thinks how he has been evil ever since he had strength in this world and done evil ever since he had been able to work. But notwithstanding, he asks that he may again walk.</P>
<P>So now this is what he sang: O?gi'we,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Ye'ond&acirc;'th&acirc;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and Gone'owo<SUP>n</SUP>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Now while he sings he has strong drink with him.</P>
<P>Now it comes to his mind that perchance evil has arisen because of strong drink and he resolves to use it nevermore. Now he continually thinks of this every day and every hour. Yea, he continually thinks of this. Then a time comes and he craves drink again for he thinks that he can not recover his strength without it.</P>
<P>Now two ways he thinks: what once he did and whether he will ever recover.</P>
