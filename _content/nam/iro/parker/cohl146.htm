<P>2 This ceremony has no certain time for its celebration but may be called by anyone, at any time, who dreams it necessary for the welfare of the settlement.</P>
<P>3 The ceremony begins at noon when arrows are shot up toward the sun while the populace shout their war cries.</P>

<P>5 Three times during this ceremony a shower of arrows are shot up to the sun accompanied by a chorus of cries, intended to notify him that they are addressing him.</P>
<P>6 Immediately afterward the Osto'w&auml;gowa is engaged in as the only fitting dance to perform before the mighty Sun.</P>
<P>II</P>

<P>4 The line of dancers dance into the long house.</P>
<P>5 Hi?'no<SUP>n</SUP> is supposed to delight in war songs and these are sung to please him.</P>
