<P>"'Now another message to tell your people.</P>
<P>"'Good food is turned into evil drink. Now some have said that there is no harm in partaking of fermented liquids.</P>
<P>"'Then let this plan be followed: let men gather in two parties, one having a feast of food, apples and corn, and the other have cider and whiskey. Let the parties be equally divided and matched and let them commence their feasting at the same time. When the feast is finished you will see those who drank the fermented juices murder one of their own party but not so with those who ate food only.'"</P>
<P>So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.</P>
