<P>"'Now another message.</P>
<P>"'This is what your people do.</P>
<P>"'An old woman punished her children&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> unjustly. The Creator is sad because of such things and bids us tell you that such practices must cease.' So they said.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_34"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 34</FONT></A></P>
<P>"'Now this is the way ordained by the Creator: Talk slowly and kindly to children and never punish them unjustly. When a child will not obey let the mother say, "Come to the water and I will immerse you." If after this warning the child is still obstinate she must take it to the water's edge and say, "Do you now obey?" and she must say so again and if at the third time there is no obedience then the child must be thrust in the water. But if the child cries for mercy it must have it and the woman must not throw it into the water. If she does she does evil.'"</P>
<P>So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_29"></A><A HREF="cohl025.htm#fr_29">33:1</A> Handsome Lake was ever the lover and champion of children. There are many instances in the Gaiwiio relating to the care and rearing of children. The mode of punishment here referred to was one of long usage. Sometimes the mother would fill her mouth with water and blow it into the face of the little offender, repeating until obedience was enforced. Punishment by violence as by whipping or striking was discountenanced. The mother <A NAME="page_34"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 34</FONT></A> who was intrusted with the care of children was accustomed to tell her children what was wrong and allow them by experience to know that her word was to be relied upon. A boy remained under the discipline of his mother until the age of sixteen when be was turned over to the training of his father. If the boy was unruly and without ambition the mother received the blame and was sometimes punished.</P>
