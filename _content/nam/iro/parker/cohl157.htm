<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">DEGI'YA?GO<SUP>n</SUP> O&Auml;`'NO?, THE BUFFALO SOCIETY</H3>
<P>The ritual of this society consists of a number of songs which relate the story of the origin of the order. After a ceremony in which there is a dance, the members depart, carrying with them the buffalo pudding. The dancers imitate the action of buffalo when stamping off flies, and the pudding is supposed to be of the consistency of the mud in which the buffalo stamps. When it is eaten it acts as a charm that "stamps off" disease or ill fortune. The Buffalos use the water drum and horn rattles.</P>
