### SECTION 68

"Now it is said that when Ganio\`dai'io\` was at Tonawanda spreading
Gai'wiio\` it happened that a certain man named
Segwai?'do<sup>n</sup>gwi said, 'I will also send a message to the four
messengers and ask whether I am right in my belief in repentance and
right doing.' So he sent his message upward in tobacco smoke."

Now when the messengers arose from a council with Ganio\`dai'io\` he
reported what they had told him. "It is a hard matter for he, the
questioner, is two-minded." So he said.

Then Segwai?'do<sup>n</sup>gwi said, "Now this will I do: I will give a
string of wampum, ot?go'ä, to the chiefs for a proof of my repentance,
for though I have been thinking, yet I can not discover that I am
two-minded."

Now when Gai'wiiostûk (the Christian religion) came this man was the
first to accept its teaching. When the chiefs heard of it they went to
him and offered to return his wampum.

Then said the man, "I will not turn back because it is for the good of
all that I have this religion."

Now all the chiefs and head-men could not persuade him to return to the
right way.

So it is said. Eniaiehuk.
