### SECTION 117

"So they took up their journey again and in a short time came to a halt.
There was a more brilliant light and as they stood suddenly they heard
the echo of a commanding voice calling the people together for the
performance of the great feather dance.

"Then asked the four messengers, 'What think you has happened?'

"He answered, 'I heard the commanding voice of Joi'ise calling the
people to celebrate the great feather dance.'

"Then replied the four messengers, 'Verily, Joi'ise, your friend is he
who calls. He it was who was faithful and good and when he passed away
in the lands of the Creator he continued as on the earth \[to be a
leader\].'"

So they said. Eniaiehuk.
