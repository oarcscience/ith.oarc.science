<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE TWO WAYS HE THINKS</H3>
<P>Now he thinks of the things he sees in the daylight.</P>
<P>The sunlight comes in and he sees it and he says, "The Creator made this sunshine." So he thinks. Now when he thinks of the sunshine and of the Creator who made it he feels a new hope within him and he feels that he may again be on his feet in this world.</P>
<P>Now he had previously given up hope of life but now he begs to see the light of another day. He thinks thus for night is coming.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_22"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 22</FONT></A></P>
<P>So now he makes an invocation that he may be able to endure the night.</P>
<P>Now he lives through the night and sees another day. So then he prays that he may see the night and it is so. Because of these things he now believes that the Great Ruler has heard him and he gives him thanks.</P>
<P>Now the sick man's bed is beside the fire. At night he looks up through the chimney hole and sees the stars and he thanks the Great Ruler that he can see them for he knows that he, the Creator, has made them.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
<P>Now it comes to him that because of these new thoughts he may obtain help to arise from his bed and walk again in this world. Then again he despairs that he will ever see the new day because of his great weakness. Then again he has confidence that he will see the new day, and so he lives and sees it.</P>
<P>For everything he sees he is thankful. He thinks of the Creator and thanks him for the things he sees. Now he hears the birds singing and he thanks the Great Ruler for their music.</P>
<P>So then he thinks that a thankful heart will help him.</P>
<P>Now this man has been sick four years but he feels that he will now recover.</P>
<P>And the name of the sick man is Ganio`dai'io`&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> a council chief [Hoya'ne].</P>
