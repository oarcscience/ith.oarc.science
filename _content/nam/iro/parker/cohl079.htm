<P>"Now it is said that when Ganio`dai'io` was at Tonawanda spreading Gai'wiio` it happened that a certain man named Segwai?'do<SUP>n</SUP>gwi said, 'I will also send a message to the four messengers and ask whether I am right in my belief in repentance and right doing.' So he sent his message upward in tobacco smoke."</P>
<P>Now when the messengers arose from a council with Ganio`dai'io` he reported what they had told him. "It is a hard matter for he, the questioner, is two-minded." So he said.</P>
<P>Then Segwai?'do<SUP>n</SUP>gwi said, "Now this will I do: I will give a string of wampum, ot?go'&auml;, to the chiefs for a proof of my repentance, for though I have been thinking, yet I can not discover that I am two-minded."</P>
<P>Now when Gai'wiiost&ucirc;k (the Christian religion) came this man was the first to accept its teaching. When the chiefs heard of it they went to him and offered to return his wampum.</P>
<P>Then said the man, "I will not turn back because it is for the good of all that I have this religion."</P>
