### SECTION 125

"Now at this time there was a man and his name was New Voice, a chief of
equal rank with Cornplanter. Now this man urged Ganio\`dai'io\` to
accept the invitation of his friends and relatives of Onondaga. He said,
'It is as if they were stretching forth their necks to see you coming.
Now I am going forth to a gathering of chiefs at Buffalo on the long
strip that is the fireplace of the Six Nations, <span
id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_92) the great meeting place of human
creatures. I will go so that I may believe that you are. on your journey
and I will ride away as fast as my horse can go.' So he said."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_92"></span>[78:1](cohl136.htm#fr_92) At this time there was
an Onondaga village on the Buffalo Creek tract. It became therefore a
legal meeting place for the Six Nations. The Canadian refugees often
returned to council there.
