### SECTION 25

"'Now another message.

"'Three things that our younger brethren (the white people) do are right
to follow.

"'Now, the first. The white man works on a tract of cultivated ground
and harvests food for his family. So if he should die they still have
the ground for help. If any of your people have cultivated ground let
them not be proud on that account. If one is proud there is sin within
him but if there be no pride there is no sin.

"'Now, the second thing. It is the way a white man builds a house. He
builds one warm and fine appearing so if he dies the family has the
house for help. Whoso among you does this does right, always providing
there is no pride. If there is pride it is evil but if there is none, it
is well.

"'Now the third. The white man keeps horses and cattle. Now there is no
evil in this for they are a help to his family. So if he dies his family
has the stock for help. Now all this is right if there is no pride. No
evil will follow this practice if the animals are well fed, treated
kindly and not overworked. Tell this to your people.'

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.
