### SECTION 12

"'Now another message.

"'Now this concerns both husband and wife. Now it may happen that a man
and wife live together happily. At length the man thinks that he will go
to another settlement to visit relatives there. His wife agrees and he
goes. Now when he gets to the village he induces some agreeable woman to
live with him saying he is single. Then after some time the man goes
back to his own family. His wife treats him cordially as if no trouble
had occurred. Now we, the messengers, say that the woman is good in the
eyes of her Creator and has a place reserved for her in the
heaven-world. Now the woman knew all that had been done in the other
settlement but she thought it best to be peaceful and remain silent. And
the Creator says that she is right and has her path toward the
heaven-world, but he, the man, is on his way to the house of the Wicked
One.'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.
