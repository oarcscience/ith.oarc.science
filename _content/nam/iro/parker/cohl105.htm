Now when they were a distance apart they turned and he was facing them. So they greeted each other. Then said the man, 'Sedwa:go'wan&ecirc;, I must ask you a question. Did you never hear your grandfathers say that once there was a certain man upon the earth across the great waters who was slain by his own people?' That was what he said when he spoke.</P>
<P>"Then answered Sedwa:go'wan&ecirc;, 'It is true. I have heard my grandparents say this.'</P>

Now it is true that I am a spirit and the one of him who was murdered. Now tell your people that they will become lost when they follow the ways of the white man.'"</P>
<P>So that is what he said. Eniaiehuk.</P>
