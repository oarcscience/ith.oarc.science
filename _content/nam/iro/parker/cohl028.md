### SECTION 17

"'Now another message.

"'Some people live together righteously as man and wife according as the
Creator ordained, but they have no child. When this is so let this be
the way: If the wife's sister has children, of these let the wife
without issue take from one to three and rear them and thereby fulfil
her duty to the Creator. Moreover when a woman takes children she must
rear them well as if born of herself. We, the messengers, say that you
must tell this to your people.'"

So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.
