<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">GANIODAIIO COMMANDED TO PROCLAIM THE GAIWIIO</H3>
<P>"'And now behold! Look through the valley between two hills. Look between the sunrise and the noon!'</P>
<P>"So I looked, and in the valley there was a deeper hollow from which smoke was arising and steam as if a hot place were beneath.</P>
<P>Then spoke the messengers saying, 'What do. you see?'</P>
<P>I answered, 'I see a place in the valley from which smoke is arising and it is also steaming as a hot place were beneath.'</P>
<P>"Then said the beings, 'Truly you have spoken. It is the truth. In that place a man is buried. He lies between the two hills in the hollow in the valley and a great message is buried with him. Once we commanded that man to proclaim that message to the world but he refused to obey. So now he will never rise from that spot for he refused to obey. So now to you, therefore, we say, proclaim the message that we give you and tell it truly before all people.'</P>
<P>"'Now the first thing has been finished and it remains for us to uncover all wickedness before you.' So they said."</P>
