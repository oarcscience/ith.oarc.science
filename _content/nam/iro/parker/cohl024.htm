<P>"'Now another message.</P>
<P>"'This concerns a certain thing that human creatures follow. It is concerning gakno`we'haat. Some men desire constant new experience, that is some men are always following ye:'o<SUP>n</SUP>?. Now it is a great evil for men to have such desires. This is a thing that the so sinful must confess. A man who desires to know gagwe:go<SUP>n</SUP> ye:'o<SUP>n</SUP>?sho' will never be satisfied, for ye:'o<SUP>n</SUP>?, will arise whom he can not know and he will fall flat. Now we, the messengers, say that all this is sinful and men must not follow such desires.'"</P>
<P>So they said and he said. Eniaiehuk.</P>
