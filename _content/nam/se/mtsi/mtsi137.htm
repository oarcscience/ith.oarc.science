<P>Many Indians once lived far down in the earth where they had been made out of the clay. Half of them decided to come up and began the ascent. As it was dark where they were they procured pine torches and fastened them on their horses. They camped four times on the journey and then came out at noon into the bright sunshine. They were very glad to get out and find a good place on the firm ground in which to camp.</P>
