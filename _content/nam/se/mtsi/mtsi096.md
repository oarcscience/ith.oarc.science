### 3. THE ORIGIN OF WOLVES

A doctor made the Wolf. That doctor while traveling along took up a pine
cone lying in the trail. He carried it along and presently found another
in the trail and took that. He held one in each hand, sang, and blew
upon them. He went on with them, and came to a fork in the trail. He
stopped, sang, blew on them, and struck them together. After he had
stood there with them for a while he rolled one of them along upon one
trail and the other down the other trail. Both of the pine cones then
turned into Wolves. But they were weak and their feet were not stout.
They came back to where the doctor stood.

When they got there that man blew on his hands and felt of the Wolves'
backs. He blew on both of his hands and felt of the backs. After he did
this the Wolves grew stouter, and the man said to them, "Both of you go
along on this trail until you come to where a man lives who has much
property. What he eats, you eat with him." After he had so spoken, the
Wolves started along barking and scratching up the dirt.

After they had gone, that man was sorry. He thought, "I am worthless for
having done that." He went along on the other trail, but from that time
on the Wolves have disturbed the stock.

It has been told.
