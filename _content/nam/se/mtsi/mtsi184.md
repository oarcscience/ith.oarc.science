### 48. A WAR BETWEEN THE ALABAMA AND THE CHOCTAW

Once when the Alabama went to fight the Choctaw there were but few of
them. While the rest sat down the head man walked about. A large number
of Choctaw were encamped about them, The Alabama wanted to go on, so
they endeavored to make their enemies sleep by the use of medicine, and
they put them all to sleep. "Let three men go on ahead," they said, and
they went on. While, all of the Choctaw slept they passed through, and
one said, "Here is the head man," so they jumped upon him and tied him
up. Then

the Choctaw woke up, ran into the bushes, and when they got there
reviled their enemies, saying, "To-morrow we will come." Then they
brought the head man back.

Presently, when day came, numbers of Choctaw came out. And the head man
of the Alabama ran out first of all to meet them. He went on and
disappeared among the crowds of men, shouting. As if struck with
lightning the Choctaw all fell to the ground \[by magic?\]. Then they
got up and ran away.
