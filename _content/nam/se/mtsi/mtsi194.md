### 58. RABBIT AND THE BOX (66)

One time Rabbit started off and at a considerable distance from home
found in the trail an old dirty pair of trousers. He shook the dirt from
them and carried them along. Then he went on and came to an old hat. He
went on again and found an old rotten ax. Going on farther he came to an
Indian chief who owned some negroes. Rabbit took his old ax and began
chopping timber with it. Then one of the negroes saw him and told his
master. He said, "Somebody is stealing timber."

Then the chief started out and asked Rabbit why he was doing so. Rabbit
replied, "I want some good wood," and he knocked the chief down and
killed him.

For this the people put Rabbit into a big box along with some stones and
directed that he be thrown into the water; but they waited until
afternoon before carrying out their intention. While they were gone a
negro heard Rabbit crying inside, and he opened the box. "Were you
crying?" the negro said to him. "They are going to give me a pretty
girl," he said. Upon that the negro let him out, but got inside in his
place. Rabbit fastened the box and then disappeared. When noon was past
the people came back and threw the box into the water. And the negro
remained inside of the box crying, "Master, master." He was drowned.
