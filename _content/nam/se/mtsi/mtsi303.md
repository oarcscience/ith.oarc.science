### 38. THE MOSQUITO

A man (probably a Natchez) was out hunting and heard a noise a long
distance behind him, "Wâmp, wâmp, wâmp." He said to himself, "I believe
that white people are chasing me with hounds." After he had gotten along
some distance farther he heard a quick rushing noise behind him, and
looking about he saw a big mosquito flying toward him. Then the man
jumped behind a large tree and the mosquito flew against it so hard that
its bill ran clear through and came out close to where the man stood.
The man took a hatchet he had with him and pounded on the end of the
mosquito's bill so that it became riveted and he could not withdraw it.
Then the mosquito brought his wings forward in an effort to pull his
bill loose and the man cut them off. He thought, "These will make good
fans for old men." He stuck them into a pack he had on his back, but
when the sun shone out hot the wings turned to powder.
