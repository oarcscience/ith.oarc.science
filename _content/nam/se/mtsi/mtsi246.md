### 46. PANTHER AND RATTLESNAKE

Panther and Rattlesnake disputed as to who could kill something first.
Panther said, "I can kill and bring in something before the sun gets
up," and Rattlesnake said, "I will also bring in something." Next day,
just before sunrise, Panther brought in some game (a deer). Rattlesnake
brought his in afterwards.
