<P>The Raccoon met the Opossum, and the Opossum said: "How did you make such pretty rings on your tail?"</P>
<P>The Raccoon replied: "I wrapped bark around my tail and stuck it into the fire."</P>
<P>Then the Opossum got some bark, wrapped it around his tail, which then had hair on it, and built a fire. He stuck his tail into the fire and burned all of the hair off and ever since then opossums have had no hair on their tails.</P>
