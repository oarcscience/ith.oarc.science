### 28. THE MAN AND THE GHOST (24)

A man went hunting. Presently he killed a deer, roasted it and piled up
the meat. When it was night a man came and sat down by the fire. The
hunter gave him deer meat. He ate for a while and then took the rest of
the deer meat and carried it off. When he came back the hunter gave him
some more venison and he carried it off. He came back again, he gave him
some venison, and he carried it off. So it continued until the venison
was exhausted. The last time he took the deer hide and when he had just
started off with it the man ran away. He ran on and started to cross a
creek on a foot log, but he slipped off and fell into the water. The man
behind ran on and on after him, mounted on the foot log, crossed,
stopped, ran back, crossed again, and kept going back and forth. "He
went this way," he kept saying. When daylight came he went back and
disappeared. As soon as the sun rose the hunter, who had remained down
in the water, got out and went back to his camp. When he got there he
tracked the other. On the way he saw some old spunk stuck into the crack
of a tree which he pulled out and threw away. He put fire in there and
when the tree burned the ghost, whose house it was, began to cry and was
destroyed.
