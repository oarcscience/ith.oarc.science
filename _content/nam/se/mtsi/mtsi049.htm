<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">47. RABBIT GETS A TURKEY FOR WILDCAT (64)</H3>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">(SECOND VERSION)</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Tuggle collection)</P>
<P>A Rabbit was overtaken by a Wildcat, who threatened to kill and eat him. The Rabbit said: "Do not kill me; I will bring you a turkey." The Wildcat consented to let Rabbit try, so he ran into the woods to find the turkey, first telling the Wildcat to lie down and pretend he was dead.</P>
