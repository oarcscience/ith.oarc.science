### 41. THE TWO IRISHMEN

### (EUROPEAN)

Two Irishmen bought a horse. One said to the other, "You ride him," and
the other said, "You ride him." When the two were leading him about, one
finally agreed to ride him, but when the horse moved he fell off. Then
the two walked along leading him. Then one said to the other, "You ride
him," and the other replied, "You ride him." While they were going along
the other one mounted in his turn, but when the horse started up he fell
off. "It is dangerous," they said. They got scared of him and merely led
him. On the way they came to where two people were harvesting pumpkins.
"What are those?" they asked. "The long ones are horse eggs, and the
round ones mule eggs," they answered. Then they thought, "If we get one
and hatch it the animal will grow up gentle," so they exchanged their
horse for a round pumpkin, took the pumpkin, and started on.

When they were running down a hill some time later, the one who held the
pumpkin stubbed his toe and fell down and the pumpkin rolled away,
struck a tree, and burst. A rabbit which was sitting in the neighborhood
ran off and they thought a little mule had hatched out. "Little mule,
little mule," they called to it and pursued it, but soon lost it.
