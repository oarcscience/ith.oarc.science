### 29. THE STORY OF THE TURKEY (39)

(Tuggle collection)

The Seminoles have a story about the Turkey, who was once the king of
the birds and flew high in the air like the eagle. He would swoop down
on the council ground and bear away a man. Then people devised a plan to
catch him. Four men were to roll four big balls along the ball ground,
so as to attract his attention as he circled in the air above them, and
four swift warriors were to watch the Turkey as he came down and seize
him. The Turkey was seen flying in the clouds over the council ground
and at last down he swooped, having the scalp of his last victim hanging
at his breast. All of the warriors were afraid to touch him, but an old
dog seized him by the leg and they then killed him.

Ever since then the turkeys have been afraid of man, but more alarmed at
dogs. The turkey gobbler still wears the scalp lock at his breast as a
trophy of his former valor.
