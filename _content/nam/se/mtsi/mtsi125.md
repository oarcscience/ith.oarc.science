### 32. RABBIT AND WILDCAT (64)

Wildcat and Rabbit were traveling about together. Wildcat said, "My
friend, I am very hungry." When Wildcat said that to Rabbit, he
answered, "If that is so, wait here for me and I will go and bring some
turkeys which I saw walking about. When I whoop you may know that I am
coming back with them. Then you pretend to be dead. Lie down and I will
bring them. Then I will sing to them and when they step on you in
dancing, catch one of them."

He started off and found the turkeys. Rabbit said, "Wildcat, who used to
eat you, I saw lying dead. Let us go to the place and I will sing so
that you can dance on him and enjoy yourselves." When he said that they
answered, "If that is so, all right." All went along together and when
they got there Wildcat acted as if he were dead. While he lay there
Rabbit sang for them (in Creek), "Catch the redheaded one. Catch the big
one." The turkeys said, "Heh, that doesn't sound good." "Well, that is
the song for this kind of dance." When he said that Wildcat jumped up.
The turkeys scattered, he caught one and the rest disappeared; Rabbit
also ran away and disappeared.
