<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Tuggle collection)</P>
<P>The people were engaged in a war. Whenever they were on the point of winning the victory the Big Rock Man came to the rescue of their enemies and saved them from defeat.</P>
<P>They called a council to devise measures to conquer the Big Rock Man, but in vain. They could not hurt him. Their arrows bounded from his body.</P>
<P>Then they consulted the Wise Rabbit.</P>
<P>"Shoot him in the ear," said the Wise Rabbit.</P>
<P>In the next fight they aimed their arrows at his ear and one struck him in the ear and killed him.</P>
