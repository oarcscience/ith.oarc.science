### 43. THE EAGLE'S NEST (27)

A man traveling about became frightened at a big eagle which he saw
moving along and got into a hollow tree. Then the eagle took him, tree
and all, carried him to his little eaglets, and laid him down there. The
eaglets sat on the top of a high hill. When day came the mother bird
went away and in the evening came back.

Then the man watched the eaglets. When they grew bigger and could fly
some, and just after their mother had started away, the man came out of
his log, mounted upon the back. of one of them, and came down. He tried
to come toward the ground, and if the bird flew up a little, he struck
it on the head and it came on down again. If it turned round and flew up
again, he again hit it and it descended farther. It came on, and, when
it had almost reached the ground, he heard its mother screaming behind.
But the eaglet came on down and when it reached the earth he got off and
ran away.
