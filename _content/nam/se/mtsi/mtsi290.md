### 25. THE FOX AND THE CRAWFISH

### (EUROPEAN)

The Fox wanted to catch the Crawfish in order to eat him, and the
Crawfish said, "We will run a race, and if you can beat me you can have
me." They agreed upon a course over seven hills, and squatted down at
one end ready to start. One of them was to say "Let us go." Then the Fox
had his tail stretched out close by the Crawfish and the latter seized
it, so when they started he clung on and the Fox carried him from one
end of the course to the other. At the other end of the course the Fox
turned about quickly and the Crawfish was switched off in such a way
that he fell some distance farther on. He said, "I told you that you
couldn't outrun me."
