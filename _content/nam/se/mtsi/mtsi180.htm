<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">44. THE MAN WHO RESCUED HIS WIFE BY STRATEGY</H3>
<P>A man who had just married took his wife and started off hunting. They camped at a certain place, went out hunting from there, killed a deer and brought it in. But while they were roasting the meat men of another nation surrounded them, holding their bows in readiness to shoot.</P>

The man stood near for a while and then ran off and disappeared. After he had gone along for some time he sorrowed very much for his wife and thought, "How shall I get her back?"

"He probably has many friends near by," they thought, so they let the woman go and ran away while the man seized his wife and ran off as fast as possible.</P>
