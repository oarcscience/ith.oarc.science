### 62. RABBIT AND BUZZARD

While Rabbit was lying down Buzzard came to him and Rabbit said, "I want
to go up like you." So Rabbit mounted upon Buzzard and Buzzard flew up
with him. He went along until he came to a door, when Buzzard said,
"Hold onto this door." But when he did so Buzzard went flying off with
the many buzzards which lived there. Rabbit hung there for a long time.
He hung there until he got tired, when he fell down and burst.

Then his grandmother sat down and doctored him until she had healed him
completely. "Do something to that Buzzard," she said. So Rabbit started
off, came to a marsh, and lay down there. Buzzard flew around in circles
for a while and then came down and stood upon him, whereupon Rabbit
seized him. With the assistance of his grandmother, he pulled all of
Buzzard's feathers out. After that was done he tied him in the marsh and
called for cold weather, and when it got very cold his grandmother gave
Buzzard a switching.
