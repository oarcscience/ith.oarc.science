Bear and Rabbit became friends. Then Bear said, "Come and visit me."

In a little while Rabbit cried out and then stopped, and the people
said, "What is the matter?" "Nothing. He cries out only because he is
afraid of the medicine." By and by Buzzard said, "Open the door for me."
They opened it and he flew far off and sat on a tree. When they looked
at Rabbit, only bones were left. Then they were angry with Buzzard and
shot at him, but they merely shot him through the bill. Buzzard said,
"Oh! I am glad to have something hanging from my nose." <span
