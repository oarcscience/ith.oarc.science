<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">44. RABBIT STEALS FIRE (67)</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(Tuggle collection)</P>
<P>All the people came together and said: "How shall we obtain fire?" It was agreed that Rabbit should try to obtain fire for the people.</P>
<P>He went across the great water to the east. He was received gladly, and a great dance was arranged. Then Rabbit entered the dancing circle, gaily dressed, and wearing a peculiar cap on his head into which he had stuck four sticks of rosin.</P>
<P>As the people danced they approached nearer and nearer the sacred fire in the center of the circle. The Rabbit also danced nearer and nearer the fire. The dancers began to bow to the sacred fire, lower and lower. Rabbit also bowed to the fire, lower and lower. Suddenly, as he bowed very low, the sticks of rosin caught fire and his head was a blaze of flame.</P>
<P>The people were amazed at the impious stranger who had dared to touch the sacred fire. They ran at him in anger, and away ran Rabbit, the people pursuing him. He ran to the great water and plunged in, while the people stopped on the shore.</P>
<P>Rabbit swam across the great water, with the flames blazing from his cap. He returned to his people, who thus obtained fire from the east.</P>
