### 64. SOME SHORT STORIES

There were two villages hostile to each other. A man belonging to one
obtained a medicine inclosed in a bottle. If this were uncorked it would
kill everyone in the neighborhood by means of a pestilence, or something
of the kind. The man was taking it to the opposing village intending to
open it there, but just before he got to that village he opened it by
mistake and the smell of it killed him instead of his enemies.

There is a story to the effect that in ancient times the bear was the
Indians' hog, the turkeys their chickens, and the kā'nta (*Smilax* root)
their flour, but they did not watch them so they ran away and became
wild.

Once a man had tied his horse with two halters. A Comanche came that
night to steal the horse and untied one of the ropes but did not see the
other. So when he mounted and started to ride away the other halter
pulled the horse round in a circle suddenly and the Indian fell off.
