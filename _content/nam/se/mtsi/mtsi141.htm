<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">5. FIRE (12)</H3>
<P>Bears formerly owned the Fire and they always took it about with them. One time they set it on the ground and went on farther eating acorns. The Fire nearly went out and called aloud. It was almost extinguished. "Feed me," it said. Then some human beings saw it. They got a stick toward the north and laid it down upon it. They got another stick toward the west and laid it down upon it. They got a stick at the south and laid it down there. They got another at the east and laid it down and the Fire blazed up. When the bears came to get their Fire, it said, "I don't know you any more." They did not get it back and so it belongs to human beings.</P>
