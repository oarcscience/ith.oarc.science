### 82. THE ORIGIN OF RACES <span id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16)

There is an old story to the effect that some people once came to a very
small pool of water to bathe. The man who entered this first came out
clean and his descendants, the white people, have the same appearance.
He had, however, dirtied the water a little and so the next man was not
quite so clean, and his descendants are the Indians. By this time the
water was very dirty and so the last man came out black and his people
are the negroes.
