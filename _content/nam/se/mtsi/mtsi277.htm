<P>grandchildren, your friends. You will take away anything dangerous from them." Wind also asked to have them for his children. "That shall not happen either. They shall be your grandchildren, he said. Rainbow asked to have them as his children. "It can't be. They shall be your grandchildren," the old man answered. Sun asked to make them his children. "It can't be," said the old man, "they shall be your nephews, your friends." Moon asked to have them as his children. "It can't be. They shall be your nephews, your friends." Fire also asked to have them as his children. "It can't be," he replied. "They shall be your grandchildren. You can warm them and cook their food as long as you live. They shall be your grandchildren." Water also asked to have them as children. "It can't be. You can have them as your friends, as your grandchildren, and keep them nice and clean. Your name will be Long-person. I can not let them be your children. They are my children," said he from the place where be sat. This is what they always used to say.</P>
