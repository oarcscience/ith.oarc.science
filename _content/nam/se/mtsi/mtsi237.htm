<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">37. THE STORY OF LIFE-EATER</H3>
<P>Once, when Life-eater was traveling about, he met a man out hunting. The man was very much frightened. Life-eater pursued him, and though the man strove to run away from him he could not</P>

<P>do so. As he was going along he seized a little rabbit and put it into his hunting bag. Life-eater is very much afraid of a dog and when evening came the man, being afraid of him, acted like a dog. He growled and barked. Life-eater stopped and said, "Listen!" By and by the hunter barked a little. The other stood still. Then the hunter took out the little rabbit and showed it to Life-eater and he disappeared on the run. The man got back to his camp and, when night came, sat down upon the ground.</P>
<P>During the night something bad (or something supernatural) came to him. It seized a stout stick to hit him but when the Indian lay down he had gotten under a forked stick, and when the bad thing wanted to give him a sweeping blow it hit the forked stick. Then the man got up quickly, ran away and jumped into a big pond near by and crossed it. Looking back, he saw his pursuer standing on the other side. Then the Indian returned home without killing anything.</P>
