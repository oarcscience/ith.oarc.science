<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">30. THE MAN AND THE DEER WOMEN (47)</H3>
<P>A man traveling about lay with a female Deer which he had killed. Later, when he was going about hunting, he found where some Deer lived and wanted to shoot them. "Don't shoot us," they said, "This one is your little girl. We will leave and go home with you." So he took them home, and they stayed with him. But they said, "Don't tell anyone about us." He obeyed and they stayed with him; they wore very pretty dresses. Some men asked him, "Where did you find the women you brought here?" but he remained silent. By and by they importuned him so much that he said, "They are deer women." Immediately the women made noises like frightened deer and ran away and he was very sorry.</P>
