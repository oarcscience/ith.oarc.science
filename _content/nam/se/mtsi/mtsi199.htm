<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">63. STORY OF THE MULE'S RETURN</H3>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">(EUROPEAN)</H3>
<P>When the Indians were living with the French, the French once assembled to visit their governor, and when they went the Indians went also. They took for the entire journey only a mule on which they put some food. When they reached the place and their food had given out they sold the mule and bought some food. They came back with food on their backs. Walking along, they got home. And, when they got home, they lay down and slept. About midnight, however, they heard some one singing and when the singer had almost reached them they heard a mule bray. It was the mule they had sold. The song went this way: "They set me down far off but I walked all the way and got home."</P>
