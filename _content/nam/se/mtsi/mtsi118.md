### 25. THE THEFT OF FIRE (67)

### (SECOND VERSION)

Rabbit was traveling about during a festal season. On those days fire
was taboo until they built a fire in the ceremonial grounds, but Rabbit
wanted to run away with some. He put pine tar on his head and went to
the dance. While he was standing about they said to him, "Act as
leader!" So he acted as leader and ran round and round the fire as if he
were going into fits. As he did so the pine tar blazed up. He ran off
with it and the people ran after him, endeavoring to catch him, but in
vain. He ran until finally he entered a hollow tree. He made a big fire
inside. Meanwhile they caused a big rain outside but were unable to put
the fire out. When it stopped raining he brought it out and set fire to
the grass. When

they caused it to rain upon it again he kept some fire inside of the
tree and when the rain stopped he resumed setting fire outside. He
scattered the fire everywhere.

It has been told.
