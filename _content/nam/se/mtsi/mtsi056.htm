When Tie-snake came out to him he said: "Alligator said to me, 'If I come down to his place I will tear him up.'" Said Tie-snake: "Let him show me."

"Yes, but I have none." Then Rabbit offered Owl some tobacco, but, when Owl came to get it, Rabbit squirted tobacco juice into his eyes and ran away, and Alligator never did get him.</P>
