<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">36. STORY OF A BISON</H3>
<P>While traveling about a hunter was overtaken by darkness and thought, "I will camp for the night and go home next morning." Near by was something which he took to be a tree pulled up by the roots, and he thought, "I will make a fire there." So he leaned his gun up against it and hung his shot pouch on it. But really it was a bison and what he hung his shot pouch on was the horn. It got up and ran off bellowing, carrying the shot pouch. After it got a long distance away it threw it off.</P>
