This is a collection of Native American lore from Texas. It is focused
on the Tejas, a Caddoan group which called itself the Hasinai. The term
'Tejas' is from a Caddoan word which means 'friend,' and it gave us the
name of Texas. The Tejas lived between the Sabine and Trinity rivers, in
modern south-east Texas. They were the furthest west of the Southeastern
native groups, in close contact with the Plains tribes, so their
folklore reflects both regions.

Written in a simple declarative style to appeal to young readers, When
the Storm God Rides is not a work of ethnology, but is based on genuine
traditional folklore from the region. The material has been romanticized
by the author, and sometimes softened for the audience, although not to
the point of becoming maudlin as often occurs in this kind of book.
However, since there is a paucity of material on the southeastern Native
Americans, and specifically those from the Texas area, this fills a gap.
