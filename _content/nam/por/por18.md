#### RITUAL CHANT AT THE PREPARATION OF THE SWEAT LODGE FOR THE SICK

**OMAHA**

*The Stone, with the curative powers of its heat, becomes a symbol of
permanency and strength.*

Ho! Aged One, eçka, <span id="fr_2"></span>[\*](#fn_2)  
At a time when there were gathered together seven persons,  
You sat in the seventh place, it is said,  
And of the Seven you alone possessed knowledge of all things,  
    Aged One, eçka.  
When in their longing for protection and guidance,  
The people sought in their minds for a way,  
They beheld you sitting with assured permanency and endurance  
In the center where converged the paths,  
There, exposed to the violence of the four winds, you sat,  
Possessed with power to receive supplications,  
    Aged One, eçka.  
Where is his mouth, by which there may be utterance of speech?  
Where is his heart, to which there may come knowledge and understanding?

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

Where are his feet, whereby he may move from place to place?  
We question in wonder,  
Yet verily it is said you alone have power to receive supplications,  
    Aged One, eçka.  
I have desired to go yet farther in the path of life with my little
ones,  
Without pain, without sickness,  
Beyond the second, third, and fourth period of life's pathway,  
    Aged One, eçka.  
O hear! This is my prayer,  
Although uttered in words poorly put together,  
    Aged One, eçka.

#### RITUAL CHANT FOR THE SICK

**OMAHA**

He! Aged One, eçka  
Thou Rock, eçka  
Aged One, eçka  
He! I have taught these little ones  
They obey, eçka  
Aged One, eçka  
He!  
He! Unmoved from time without end, verily  
Thou sittest, eçka  
In the midst of the various paths of the coming winds  
In the midst of the winds thou sittest, eçka  
Aged One, eçka  
He! The small grasses grow about thee, eçka  
Thou sittest as though making of them thy dwelling place, eçka  
He! Verily thou sittest covered with the droppings of birds, eçka  
Thy head decked with the downy feathers of the birds, eçka

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

Aged One, eçka  
Thou who standest next in power, eçka  
He! thou water, eçka.  
Water that hast been flowing  
From time unknown, eçka  
He! Of you the little ones have taken  
Though thy mysteries remain unrevealed  
These little ones crave thy touch, eçka  
He! Thou that standest as one dwelling place, eçka  
Even as one dwelling place, eçka  
Ye great animals, eçka  
He! Who make for us the covering, eçka  
These little ones, thou hast said, let their thoughts reverently dwell
on me, eçka  
He! Thou tent frame, eçka  
Thou standest with bent back o’er us  
With stooping shoulders, bending over us  
Verily, thou standest  
Thus my little ones shall speak of me, thou hast said  
Brushing back the hair from thy forehead, eçka  
The hair of thy head  
The grass that grows about thee  
Thy hairs are whitened, eçka  
The hairs that grow upon thy head, eçka  
O, the paths that the little ones shall take, eçka  
Whichever way they may flee from danger, eçka  
They shall escape. Their shoulders shall be bent with age as they walk  
As they walk on the well-beaten path  
Shading their brows now and again with their hands  
As they walk in their old age, eçka  
That of thy strength they shall partake, eçka  
Therefore thy little ones desire to walk closely by thy side, eçka  
Venerable One, eçka.

#### RITUAL OF THE COSMIC FORCES

**OMAHA**

Toward the coming of the sun  
There the people of every kind gathered,  
And great animals of every kind.  
Verily all gathered together, as well as people.  
Insects also of every description,  
Verily all gathered there together,  
By what means or manner we know not.  
Verily, one alone of all these was the greatest,  
Inspiring to all minds,  
The great white rock,  
Standing and reaching as high as the heavens, enwrapped in mist,  
Verily as high as the heavens.  
Thus my little ones shall speak of me,  
As long as they shall travel in life's path, thus they shall speak of
me.  
Such was the words, it has been said.  
Then next in rank  
Thou, male of the crane, stoodst with thy long beak  
And thy neck, none like to it in length,  
There with thy beak didst thou strike the earth.

This shall be the legend  
Of the people of yore, the red people,  
Thus my little ones shall speak of me.  
Then next in rank stood the male gray wolf, whose cry,  
Though uttered without effort, verily made the earth to tremble,  
Even the stable earth to tremble.  
Such shall be the legend of the people.  
Then next in rank stood Hega, the buzzard, with his red neck.  
Calmly he stood, his great wings spread, letting the heat of the sun
straighten his feathers.  
Slowly he flapped his wings,

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

Then floated away, as though without effort,  
Thus displaying a power (a gift of Wakonda) often to be spoken of by the
old men in their teachings.

#### SONG OF SCORN

**OMAHA**

Ena! The one I wish to marry has gone to war.  
Ena! The one I hate has not gone forth but remains here.

**THE GHOST-DANCE RELIGION**

In 1892 the last serious Indian outbreak occurred. This was occasioned
by the government's efforts to suppress the practices of a new religion
which, during the two years preceding, had spread over a large part of,
the west, among the Indian tribes from the Plains to the Coast, and from
the Columbia to the Rio Grande. The Prophet of this new cult claimed to
be the Messiah, and professed to exercise divine powers. He instituted
certain dances, which his followers, in a vain attempt to overthrow the
world-order magically, perverted into frenzied rites, wherein entranced,
they saw visions and spoke with the dead. The Messiah concept is an
ancient one in Indian mythology, antedating all Christian influence, and
so desperate had become the straits of the Vanishing Race that these
doctrines received wide acceptance. At length the government intervened
and brought the strange worship to an end.

Mr. James Mooney investigated this interesting phenomenon and actually
discovered the Seer, who proved to be an inoffensive visionary dwelling
in a remote valley of the Southwest. This young man's life and theories
(a full-blood, apparently untouched by Christian influence), curiously
resembled those of Christ, and like the latter, he preached the
doctrines of Nonresistance and the Brotherhood of Man. In this case our
government played the part of Rome.

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

These songs were sung during the dancing, and express in the image of
the Whirlwind, a mystic and exalted contemplation of the approaching
Great Change. Unessential repetitions have been omitted for brevity's
sake.
