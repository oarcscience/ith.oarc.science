<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White Head of Waters, White Head of Light&#8212;<br> Capilano; Cla&#8217;h&#8217;ya.<br> White head of the Chief to thee lifts greeting.<br> I am hoar with years as thou, great Father;<br> My hair hangs like the dropping ice<br> Of thy highest hushed waters.<br> I have lived a hundred years at thy foot,<br> Singing the prayer of thanks for life:<br> "O Kia-Kuna&euml;, Great Spirit One, Great Kind One,<br> I praise thee for life, I serve thee with living,<br> I bless thee that in kindness thou hast made the earth<br> And with love covered it.<br> Yea, by thy kindness, men and trees stand forth;<br> Silently, to me, speak they the speech of brothers.<br> For delights the little rivers come among the hills,<br> Shining with the smiles of women;<br> Ay, as the merry murmuring of many maidens</div></p>

<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Are the rivers; swift and tender in their coming.<br> (Because thou art kind, Kuna&euml;, thou madest women.)<br> It is the morn, Kuna&euml;, I pray, I praise thee."<br> Ah!&#8212;how many hundred years hast thou prayed thus, Capilano?<br> With thee this day, Mountain-Father, I thank Kuna&euml; for another dawn.<br> I am girt with blanket and rope of cedar-fibre;<br> In my ear is a ring of fine bark.<br> Thou art belted with innumerable pine-trees;<br> To thee they are smaller than feathers.<br> The sun is the cedar-ring in thine ear,<br> The long sea asleep is the spear in thy hand.<br> It is still, with pale lights on the distant blade,<br> Pointing at rest to islands beyond the dropping sky.<br> Thou art come forth, as a hunter, to the dawn,<br> Herding the antlered shadows down the forest slope.<br> Their swift fleeing hoofs strike fire from the beaten sandshores of morning,<br> And the black wraiths swoon upon the bright opening sea.<br> With blood of his proud throat crimsoning the eastern sky<br> The great Stag of the Dark in the van falls dying.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here was I chief ere the coming of the white man;<br> Now is his village spread from this sea beyond my sight.<br> His canoes are floating villages;<br> They go by with a great noise and a black smoke.<br> His deeds are mighty; they leap with roaring clouds and thunder-fires<br> Into the blue quiet morning and the white moon-sky.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet have I heard no sound mightier<br> Than the sun shattering the night<br> On thy stone shoulder, Capilano.<br> Yet have I seen no sight more wonderful and fair</div></p>

<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Than the coming of the light,<br> When Day, the silver-winged gull, down-swooping finds the sea.<br> Yet have I known no thing sweeter, stronger,<br> Than the smell of piney winds and blue rippling sea-water,<br> And the kindness of Kuna&euml;-Kia, the living One,<br> Waking the heart of the old chief<br> To another dawn of life.</div></p>
