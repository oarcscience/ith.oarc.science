### SONGS FROM THE HAKO: A PAWNEE CEREMONY

#### RENDERED IN THE RHYTHMS OF THE ORIGINALS, BY ALICE FLETCHER WITH INTERPRETATIONS BY TAHIRUSSAWICHI, A PAWNEE

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

**PREFATORY NOTE**

The position of Tahirussawichi in the Pawnee tribe is that of a man
worthy of respect—one versed in a knowledge of serious things, whose
life has been devoted to the acquisition and maintenance of certain
sacred rites. He is esteemed as a man of truth— one who has the favor of
Tiráwa. He possesses a knowledge of curative roots, and often attends
the sick, using herbs as medicine. He is the keeper of certain old and
sacred objects, and leads in their attendant ceremonies. His great care
in observing all the details of the intricate ceremony of the Hako is
well known in the tribe, and much good fortune is believed to follow his
leadership in this ceremony. His title is Kúrahus. This term is applied
to a man of years who has been instructed in the meaning and use of
sacred objects as well as their ceremonies. The word is sometimes
employed as a synonym for a venerable man, one who commands respect, but
throughout this paper it is used in its official sense—the leader of the
ceremony.

**NATURE OF THE CEREMONY**

The teachings of the public ceremony were general in character. They
emphasized, on the one hand, man's dependence on the supernatural for
all the gifts of life, and on the other hand, his dependence on the
family tie for the gifts of peace and happiness. The specific teachings
were reserved for the Son. These began in the ritual to the Dawn (tenth
ritual) on the morning of the second and third days, which prefigured
the secret ceremonies

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

of the fifth morning, when the bond .of the family relation was extended
beyond blood kinship through the symbolic rites which recognized the
common source of life in Tiráwa atius.

Looking over the entire ceremony, it is interesting to note how older
rites have had their share in the development of the Hako, and how the
trend of thought among the native seers has borne them toward a
conception of the brotherhood of man, a conception recognized as the
noblest known to the human family.

This impressive ritual-drama may be compared to a medieval Miracle Play,
and has exercised an influence no less profound on the tribes which have
performed it. The chief persons in the drama are, the Father, the Son,
the Children, and attendant Deities (the associates and representatives
of Tiráwa atius, the Master of Life). Mother Corn, Kawas, the Eagle, the
Morning Star, the Dawn, the Day and Father Sun. The Father is chosen
from the tribe which presents the great spectacle; the Son is selected
by the priests from another tribe by the curious psychic process
described in the Second Ritual. Unusual blessings are supposed to accrue
to those who take the leading parts.

#### THE HAKO: A PAWNEE CEREMONY

### FIRST RITUAL

**INVOKING THE POWERS**

**EXPLANATION BY THE KÚRAHUS, OR CHIEF PRIEST**

At the creation of the world it was arranged that there should be lesser
powers. Tiráwa atius, the mighty power, could not come near to man,
could not be seen or felt by him, therefore lesser powers were
permitted. They were to mediate between man and Tiráwa. The first song
mentions some of these lesser powers in the order in which they come
near to man, in the order of their creation.

#### INVOCATION TO THE GREAT SPIRITS

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

We heed as unto thee we call;  
Oh, send to us thy potent aid!  
Help us, Oh, holy place above!  
We heed as unto thee we call.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

We heed as unto thee we call;  
Oh, send to us thy potent aid!  
Help us, Hotoru, giver of breath!  
We heed as unto thee we call.

</div>

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

**III**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

We heed as unto thee we call;  
Oh, send to us thy potent aid!  
Help us, Shakuru, father of strength!  
We heed as unto thee we call.

</div>

**IV**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

We heed as unto thee we call;  
Oh, send to us thy potent aid!  
Help us, h’Uraru, mother of all!  
We heed as unto thee we call.

</div>

**PREPARING THE FEATHERED STEM**

Blue is the color of the sky, the dwelling place of Tirawahut, that
great circle of the powers which watch over man. As the man paints the
stick blue we sing. We ask as we sing that life be given to this symbol
of the dwelling place of Tiráwa. We paint the groove red because the
passageway is red through which man's breath comes and goes to give him
life. The sun, too, is red, and the groove represents the straight path
whereon the sun shines, the path which man must travel if he would live
in peace and prosper. The teachings of this ceremony make a straight
path along which if a man walks he will receive help from the powers.

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Take we now the blue paint,  
Touch with it the stem, putting on the sacred symbol,  
Emblem of the clear sky,  
Where dwell the gods, who, descending, bring us good gifts,  
Gifts of life and plenty.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

When the man begins to paint the stick green this song is sung.

</div>

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Take we now the green paint,  
Touch with it the stem, the mated stem,  
Putting on the emblem, the sacred and living symbol.  
Mother earth.  
From above descending, bountiful blessings on thee,  
Mother earth.

Oh, Kawas, come, with wings outspread in sunny skies!  
Oh, Kawas, come, and bring us peace, thy gentle peace!  
Oh, Kawas, come, and give new life to us who pray!

</div>

In this ceremony the brown eagle is called Kawas. This eagle has been
made holy by being sacrificed to Tiráwa. Its feathers are tied upon the
stem that has been painted blue to represent the sky.

This stem was the first one painted and decorated, because it is female
and the leader. It represents the night, the moon, the north, and stands
for kindness and helpfulness. It will take care of the people. It is the
mother.

Throughout the ceremony the Kúrahus carries this feathered stem.

#### SONG TO MOTHER CORN

Mother Corn knows all places and all that happens among men; therefore
the corn which comes from her must lead, must direct us where to go.

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Tiráwa, harken! Mighty one,  
Above us in blue, silent sky!  
We standing wait thy bidding here.  
The Mother Corn standing waits,  
Waits to serve thee here;  
The Mother Corn stands waiting here.

</div>

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Tiráwa, harken! Mighty one,  
Above us in blue, silent sky!  
We flying seek thy dwelling there.  
The Mother Corn flying goes  
Up to seek thee there;  
The Mother Corn goes flying up.

</div>

**III**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Tiráwa, harken! Mighty one,  
Above us in blue, silent sky!  
Behold! We in thy dwelling stand.  
The Mother Corn, standing there.  
Leader she is made;  
The Mother Corn is leader made.

</div>

**IV**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Tiráwa, harken! Mighty one,  
Above us in blue, silent sky!  
The downward path we take again.  
The Mother Corn, leading us,  
Doth thy symbol bear;  
The Mother Corn with power leads.

</div>

Mother Corn having reached the blue dome where dwells the great circle
of powers, Tirawahut, and having gained what she went for, tawitshpa,
authority to lead in the ceremony, she descends to earth by the four
paths.

### SECOND RITUAL

#### PREFIGURING THE JOURNEY TO THE SON

The spirit of Mother Corn leads our spirits in the search for the Son.
We draw near, in the spirit, to the village where the Son

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

dwells. The Son does not see us as we stand there; he is sleeping. We
fix our minds upon Mother Corn and upon him; we think of the gifts we
are to bring him when we come to him with the Hako, the gifts that the
birds and the animals that attend these sacred objects will surely
bestow upon him—long life, children, and plenty. Now the spirit of
Mother Corn touches him. We fix our minds upon Mother Corn and upon the
Son; if we are in earnest he will respond to her touch. He will not
waken, he will not see her, but he will see in a dream that which her
touch will bring to him, one of the birds that attend the Hako, for all
the spirits of those birds are with Mother Corn and they do her bidding,
and he may hear the bird call to him. Then, when he awakens, he will
remember his dream, and as he thinks upon it, he will know that he has
been chosen to be a Son, and that all the good things that come with the
ceremony which will make him a Son are now promised to him.

#### CHANT OF THE MYSTIC JOURNEY

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Mother Corn, Oh hear! Open our way!  
Lo! As we draw near, let our souls touch thine  
While we pray thee:  
Children give to us. Mother Corn, hear!

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Mother Corn, Oh hear! Open our way!  
Lo! Our heads we bow, while our souls touch thine;  
Then as one mind  
Make the choice of Son. Mother Corn, hear!

</div>

**III**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Mother Corn, Oh hear! Open our way!  
Lo! With head erect Mother stands, and then  
Moves she through air  
On her mission bent. Mother Corn, hear!

</div>

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

**IV**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Mother Corn, Oh hear! Open our way!  
Lo! Now over hills, over streams, we go  
Taking our way  
Toward the Children's land. Mother Corn, hear!

</div>

**V**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Mother Corn, Oh hear! Open our way!  
Lo! Our journey's end now is near, we look  
O'er the strange land,  
Seeking Children there! Mother Corn, hear!

</div>

**VI**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Mother Corn, Oh hear! Open our way!  
Lo! Our eyes behold where they dwell. In their  
Village we walk,  
Seeking there the Son. Mother Corn, hear!

</div>

**VII**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Mother Corn, Oh hear! Open our way!  
Lo! His lodge we find, through the door we pass.  
Sleeping he lies,  
Knows not we are there. Mother Corn, hear!

</div>

**VIII**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Mother Corn, Oh hear! Open our way!  
Lo! Now at her touch comes a dream; then a  
Bird calls, "My son!"  
While his soul responds. Mother Corn, hear!

</div>

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

### THIRD RITUAL

#### SENDING THE MESSENGERS

The four messengers are selected informally by the Father from among his
near relatives. They are generally young men, lithe and strong of limb,
and able to make a long journey quickly. The distance to be traveled
varies from a few miles to a hundred or more, and as they must carry all
their provisions, it becomes necessary for them to get over the ground
as rapidly as possible.

The formal appointment of these messengers takes place in the lodge of
the Father, in the presence of the sacred objects spread at ceremonial
rest.

When the messengers arrive at the lodge of the Son, he sends for his
kindred and consults with them. Only a recent death in his family or
some catastrophe which has deprived him of his property will be accepted
as sufficient excuse for his not receiving the Hako party. If he accepts
the tobacco he will bid the messengers return to the Father and say, "I
am ready." In either case he must make gifts to the messengers in
recognition of the proffered honor.

**THE FATHER'S MESSAGE TO THE SON**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I bid you travel o’er the land to the Son,**  
**And with you take these words of mine unto him:  
"Behold! Your Father comes to you speedily."

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

We wait their journey o’er the land to the Son,  
When they will give these words of mine unto him:  
"Behold! Your Father comes to you speedily."

</div>

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

### FOURTH RITUAL

#### VIVIFYING THE SACRED OBJECTS

On the morning of the day the journey is to begin the Kúrahus rises from
his place in the lodge behind the Hako and goes outside. There he ties
the sacred objects on the selected tent pole.

The rope of buffalo hair is used to tie these sacred objects to the
pole, which is then set up at the entrance of the lodge. Here it stands
where the wind of the dawn may breathe upon the Hako and the first rays
of the sun strike the sacred objects and give them life.

**SONG OF PRAISE TO MOTHER CORN**

As we sing we think that Mother breathing forth life, who has come out
of the past, has now started to lead us on the journey we are to take
and to the fulfilment of our desire that children may be given us, that
generations may not fail in the future, and that the tie may be made
strong between the Father and the Son.

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Mother with the life-giving power now comes,  
Stepping out of far distant days she comes,  
Days wherein to our fathers gave she food;  
As to them, so now unto us she gives,  
Thus she will to our children faithful be.  
Mother with the life-giving power now comes!

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Mother with the life-giving power is here.  
Stepping out of far distant days she comes.  
Now she forward moves, leading as we walk  
Toward the future, where blessings she will give,  
Gifts for which we have prayed granting to us.  
Mother with the life-giving power is here!

</div>

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

#### THE HAKO PARTY PRESENTED TO THE POWERS

**INVOCATION TO TIRÁWA**

This song is addressed to Tiráwa atius. He is the father of all and all
things come from him. We pray in our hearts as we sing. We ask Tiráwa to
watch over the Kúrahus, to guide his acts and to guard his words so that
he may make no mistake and the ceremony may be complete. From the east
the flashes of the eyes of Tiráwa come darting through the air upon us
and upon the sacred objects.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Look on us as here we are standing, raising our voices!  
Look on us as here we, presenting, lift now these emblems that are so
holy up to thy gaze!  
Swift, a flash from out of the heavens  
Falls on us as here we are standing, looking at thee.

</div>

**INVOCATION TO THE GODS**

The people are now looking toward the north, the moon, the night, the
mother of the day.

We ask the powers of the north, they who can see the path of life, to
lead us and make us able to walk, us and our children.

To all the powers of the east, west, south, and north we have sung and
have presented ourselves. As we walked, we have traced upon the earth
the figure of a man. This image that we have traced is from Tiráwa. It
has gone around with us, and its feet are where we now stand; its feet
are with our feet and will move with them as we now take four steps,
bearing the sacred objects, in the presence of all the powers and begin
our journey to the land of the Son.

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Look down, West gods, look upon us! We gaze afar on your dwelling.  
Look down while here we are standing, look down upon us, ye mighty!  
Ye thunder gods, now behold us!  
Ye lightning gods, now behold us!

</div>

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Ye that bring life, now behold us!  
Ye that bring death, now behold us!

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Look down, South gods, look upon us! We gaze afar on your dwelling.  
Look down while here we are standing, look down upon us, ye mighty!  
Ye daylight gods, now behold us!  
Ye sunshine gods, now behold us!  
Ye increase gods, now behold us!  
Ye plenty gods, now behold us.

</div>

**III**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Look down, North gods, look upon us! We gaze afar on your  
    dwelling, look down upon us, ye mighty!  
Ye darkness gods, now behold us!  
Ye moonlight gods, now behold us!  
Ye that direct, now behold us!  
Ye that discern, now behold us!

</div>

### FIFTH RITUAL

#### MOTHER CORN ASSERTS AUTHORITY

**THE JOURNEY BEGINS**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The mother leads and we follow on,  
Her devious pathway before us lies.  
She leads us as were our fathers led  
Down through the ages.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The mother leads us and we follow on,  
Her pathway straight, where a stage each day.

</div>

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

We forward walk, as our fathers walked  
Down through the ages.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mother Corn, who
led our spirits over the path we are now to travel, leads us again as we
walk, in our bodies, over the land.

We speak of this path as devious, not merely because we must go over
hills and through valleys and wind around gulches to reach the land of
the Son, but because we are thinking of the way by which, through the
Hako, we can make a man who is not of our blood a Son; a way which has
come down to us from our far-away ancestors like a winding path.

**CROSSING THE PRAIRIE**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Looking o’er the prairie, naught our eyes discern there,  
Wide the land stretches out before us;  
Then we cry aloud to Mother Corn: "Doth thy pathway lie here?"

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Heeding now our crying, while our eyes she opens,  
Mother Corn moveth out before us  
On the lonely prairie, where we see straight the pathway lies there!

</div>

**SONG OF OBEDIENCE**

Mother Corn speaks to us and we are assured in our spirits. The next
song is to enforce obedience to Mother Corn.

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Hark! She speaks, and quickly we turn to her,  
Looking toward the west to the spot where we  
Passed ’neath the eyes of gods; and now do we heed her words:  
"Yonder is the place in the distant west  
Whence I have come out of the past to you."

</div>

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

II

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Born of the earth and touched by the deep blue sky,  
Have I been chosen by the gods to lead.  
You are to hear my voice and follow my strict commands,  
As your fathers did in the days gone by.  
Thence come I to open your pathway here."

</div>

#### SONGS AND CEREMONIES OF THE WAY

The journey we are taking is for a sacred purpose, and as we are led by
the supernatural power in Mother Corn we must address with song every
object we meet, because Tiráwa is in all things. Everything we come to
as we travel can give us help, and send help by us to the Children.

Trees are among the lesser powers, and they are represented on the Hako
which we carry, so when we see trees we must sing to them.

Trees grow along the banks of the streams; we can see them at a
distance, like a long line, and we can see the river glistening in the
sunlight in its length. We sing to the river, and when we come nearer
and see the water and hear it rippling, then we sing to the water, the
water that ripples as it runs.

**SONG TO THE TREES AND STREAMS**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Dark against the sky yonder distant line  
Lies before us. Trees we see, long the line of trees,  
Bending, swaying in the breeze.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Bright with flashing light yonder distant line  
Runs before us, swiftly runs, swift the river runs,  
Winding, flowing o’er the land.

</div>

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

**III**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Hark. Oh, hark. A sound, yonder distant sound  
Comes to greet us, singing comes, soft the river's song,  
Rippling gently ’neath the trees.

</div>

**SONG WHEN CROSSING THE STREAMS**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Behold, upon the river's brink we stand!  
River we must cross;  
Oh, Kawas, come! To thee we call. Oh, come, and thy permission give  
Into the stream to wade and forward go.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Behold, the water covers now our feet!  
River we must cross;  
Oh, Kawas, hear! To thee we call. Oh, come, and thy permission give  
On through the stream to pass and forward go.

</div>

**SONG TO THE WIND**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Hither, Winds, come to us, touch where water  
O’er us flowed when we waded;  
Come, oh, Winds, come!

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Lo! The Winds round us sweep where water  
O’er us flowed. Safe now are we,  
By the Winds safe.

</div>

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

**SONG TO THE MOUNTAINS**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Mountains loom upon the path we take;  
Yonder peak now rises sharp and clear;  
Behold! It stands with its head uplifted,  
Thither go we, since our way lies there.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Mountains loom upon the path we take;  
Yonder peak now rises sharp and clear;  
Behold! We climb, drawing near its summit;  
Steeper grows the way and slow our steps.

</div>

**III**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Mountains loom upon the path we take;  
Yonder peak that rises sharp and clear,  
Behold us now on its head uplifted;  
Planting there our feet, we stand secure.

</div>

**IV**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Mountains loom upon the path we take;  
Yonder peak that rose so sharp and clear,  
Behold us now on its head uplifted;  
Resting there at last, we sing our song.

</div>

**SONG TO THE MESA**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The mesa see; its flat top like a straight line cuts across the sky;  
It blocks our path, and we must climb, the mesa climb.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

More mesas see; their flat tops rise against the sky, they bar our
path;  
We reach their base, and we must climb, the mesas climb.

</div>

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

**III**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The mesas' side we now ascend, the sharp ridge pass, its flat top
reach;  
There lies their base that we must take, and forward go.

</div>

**IV**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The mesas rise around us still, their flat tops cut across the sky:  
They block our way, yet still we climb, the mesas climb.

</div>

#### MOTHER CORN REASSERTS LEADERSHIP

**THE SEARCH FOR THE CHILDREN**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Here we give our thanks, led by Mother Corn,  
As our eyes dwell upon the borders of the land  
Where dwell the Children we are seeking.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now our eyes look on people walking to.  
Soon our eyes catch the print of footsteps on the ground,  
Made by the Children we are seeking.

</div>

**III**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Still we travel on, led by Mother Corn.  
Now our eyes look on people walking to and fro;  
They the Children are, we are seeking.

</div>

As we move on and enter the land of the Children we sing, in the second
stanza, about their footprints, the marks of their moccasins where they
have walked to and fro on the ground. We may not actually see these
marks, but the song represents us as seeing them; Mother Corn has seen
them, and she is leading us.

When the village of the Children is in sight the following

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

song is sung. Mother Corn speaks in the first stanza and tells us she
has come again to this place. Her spirit had been here before when she
came seeking the Son. To-day we have arrived with her at this her
destination, and we give thanks to Mother Corn.

**SONG OF THE JOURNEY'S END**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Here is the place where I came, seeking to find the Son;  
Here have I led you again, here is our journey's end.  
Thanks we give unto the Mother Corn!  
Here is the place where she came, seeking to find the Son;  
Here she has led us again, here is our journey's end.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Here to this place have we come, bringing the Son our gifts,  
All of the gifts that go forth bearing the promised help.  
Thanks he'll give as he sees, Mother Corn,  
All of the gifts that we bring, bring to his village here;  
Here, where you led, Mother Corn; here, where our journey ends.

</div>

### SIXTH RITUAL

#### THE SON'S MESSAGES RECEIVED

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now our eyes look on him who is here;  
He is as the Son we have sought;  
He brings again tidings from the Son:  
"Father, come to me, here I sit,  
Waiting here for thee."

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now our eyes look on him who is clad  
As befits the Son we have sought;

</div>

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

He, arising, walks; follow we his steps,  
Moving slowly on toward the Son,  
Where he waiting sits.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The pack
containing the clothing provided for this representative of the Son is
now opened. After the messenger has finished eating he is dressed in the
new clothing.

We clothe him because that is an act which marks the care of a father
for his child. The garments we put upon him are fine and embroidered;
these fine and carefully made garments show that we have been thinking
of him, that we regard him highly and wish to do him honor.

Just before we reach the village we halt and sing the next song.

**SEEKING THE SON**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Where is he, the Son?  
Where his dwelling place that I seek?  
Which can be his lodge, where he sits  
Silent, waiting, waiting there for me?

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Here is he, the Son,  
Here is his dwelling place that I seek;  
This is here his lodge, where he sits  
Silent, waiting, waiting here for me.

</div>

### SEVENTH RITUAL

#### THE CONSECRATION OF THE LODGE

When the Son has dispatched his messenger to the Hako party, he with a
few of his near relatives, enters the lodge set apart for

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

the ceremony, there to await the return of his messenger and the coming
of the Fathers.

He seats himself at the south side of the lodge near the door. This is
the humblest place, and he takes it to show that he is not seeking his
own honor. By the choice of him as the Son a very high honor has been
bestowed upon him, and his appreciation of this is shown by his taking
the seat of the lowliest and not assuming prominence before the people.

The Kúrahus directs the chief of the Hako party to advance one step and
to stand upon the threshold while the first stanza of the next song is
sung.

**TOUCHING AND CROSSING THE THRESHOLD**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Sent down by powers on high,  
She bears a promise most sure;  
The Mother Corn breathes forth life,  
On threshold She stands  
Of my Son's dwelling. All's well!

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Sent down by powers on high,  
She bears a promise most sure—  
Now Kawas, bringing new life,  
The threshold crosses  
Of my Son's dwelling. All's well!

</div>

**MOTHER CORN BREATHING LIFE IS NOW WALKING IN THE LODGE**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The Mother Corn, with breath of life,  
Now enters into my Son's lodge;  
There she walks within:  
With breath of life walks Mother Corn.  
The Mother Corn, with breath of life,

</div>

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now circles she within the lodge,  
Walking round within;  
With breath of life walks Mother Corn.

</div>

**KAWAS HOVERS OVERHEAD IN THE LODGE**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Kawas, bearing new life, entereth this dwelling,  
Comes as to her own nest, on her spread pinions;  
There so gently she hovers over these her Children.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Kawas, bearing new life, flieth through this dwelling,  
All the lodge she cleanses, with her wings sweeping,  
Making clear the place, sweeping out the harm and danger.

</div>

#### CLOTHING THE SON AND OFFERING THE SMOKE

The lodge having been made ready as a nest within which life might be
given and made secure, the Father performs his first act of recognition
and responsibility. He puts upon the Son the garments he has previously
prepared for the purpose. When clad in the finely embroidered clothing,
the Son is told to make the offering of smoke to Tiráwa atius, as a
prayer for the consecration of the new-born relationship.

**THE SON PRAYS TO THE GODS**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Oh, speak to the gods list’ning above us!  
Oh, let your prayers ascend to the mighty ones on high!

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

My son obeys. His voice is now trav’ling far, speeding on;  
It goes to the list’ning gods above us;  
There will his prayer be heard by the mighty ones on high.

</div>

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

**SONG OF THE PRAYER SMOKE**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

See the smoke pass by!  
Rising high above, follows where his voice  
Sped, intent to reach  
Where the gods abide in the deep blue sky.  
See the smoke pass by!

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

See the smoke ascend!  
Now the odor mounts, follows where his voice  
Sped, intent to reach  
Where the gods abide. There the odor pleads,  
Pleads to gain us help.

</div>

### EIGHTH RITUAL (FIRST DAY)

#### THE FATHERS FEED THE CHILDREN

Now the heralds summon the people to the lodge and they come, dressed in
their best attire and bringing gifts.

**IN PRAISE OF TIRÁWA**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Father, unto thee we cry!  
Father thou of gods and men;  
Father thou of all we hear;  
Father thou of all we see—  
Father, unto thee we cry!

</div>

**INVOCATION TO THE ALL-FATHER**

When the Kúrahus begins to sing this song he must think what this
ceremony is for and be mindful that all the powers that the heavens
contain and all the powers that are felt over the earth are now coming
near and bending over the Hako.

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

All the powers that are in the heavens and all those that are upon the
earth are derived from the mighty power, Tiráwa atius. He is the father
of all things visible and invisible. He is the father of all the people,
and perpetuates the life of the tribe through the gift of children. So
we sing, your father, meaning the father of all people everywhere, the
father of all things that we see and hear and feel.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Father, thou above, father of the gods,  
They who can come near and touch us,  
Do thou bid them bring us help.  
Help we need. Father, hear us!

</div>

#### SONGS FOR LAYING DOWN THE FEATHERED STEMS

**FIRST SONG**

The feathered stems represent the eagle; the holy place, where the stems
are laid to rest, represents the eagle's nest. A nest is made for the
young; the making of a nest in the lodge of the Son by Kawas presages
the fulfillment of the promise of children to the Son, as well as the
establishment of a close bond, like that of father and son, between the
members of two unrelated clans or tribes.

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

See where she comes to her little one lying so snugly and safely the
nest in!  
Hark! She is calling; hear her,  
List as her nestlings make answer;  
See how she gently hovers.  
Happy our hearts as we look on her hovering over her nestlings so
gently.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

See where she comes to her little ones lying so snugly and safely the
nest in!  
Hark! She is calling; hear her,

</div>

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

List as her nestlings answer;  
See her alighting gently.  
Happy our hearts as we see her alighting there over her nestlings so
gently.

</div>

**SECOND SONG**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Loud, loud the young eagles cry, cry, seeing their mother come;  
Flies she to them slantwise, flies;  
Then over the nest she hangs, there hovering, stays her flight;  
Thanks, thanks as we look we give.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Thanks, thanks, from our hearts we give, thanks give as we watch the
bird  
As she to them slantwise flies:  
Then over her nest she drops; there, folding her wings, she rests,  
Rests safely within her nest.

</div>

### NINTH RITUAL (FIRST NIGHT)

#### THE VISIONS ARE INVOKED

When the sun has set and it is dark and the stars are shining, then the
Children gather in the lodge. Some, as they come in, will advance to the
holy place and there drop a stick; this means the gift of a pony. For
every such gift the Kúrahus returns thanks to the giver.

After all are seated, wood is piled upon the fire, and when the flames
leap high the Kúrahus rises, then his assistant and the chief rise and
the Hako are taken up.

The singers carrying the drum follow the Hako bearers as they move
slowly around the lodge, singing the following song.

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

**I**

    Holy visions!  
Hither come, we pray you, come unto us,  
Bringing with you joy;  
Come, oh, come to us, holy visions,  
Bringing with you joy.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> We sing about the
visions which the birds on the feathered stems are to bring to the
Children.

Visions come from above, they are sent by Tiráwa atius. The lesser
powers come to us in visions. We receive help through the visions. All
the promises which attend the Hako will be made good to us in this way.

Visions can come most readily at night; spirits travel better at that
time. Now when we are met together we, the Fathers, call upon the
visions to come to the Children.

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Holy visions!  
Near are they approaching, near to us here,  
Bringing with them joy;  
Nearer still they come—holy visions—  
Bringing with them joy.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The visions have
heard the call of the spirits of the birds upon the feathered stems,
joined to the call of our spirits, and they are descending by the east
from their dwelling place above, and are coming toward the lodge.

We sing, "They are coming," and the Children join in the song, as we
pass around and wave the feathered stems.

**III**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Holy visions!  
Lo! Before the doorway pause they, waiting,  
Bearing gifts of joy;

</div>

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Pausing there they wait—holy visions—  
Bearing gifts of joy.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> As we sing the
visions touch and cross the threshold and then pass down the long
passageway leading into the lodge. As we reach the west they have
entered the lodge.

Kawas and all the birds have called these visions to bless the Children.
The visions have heard, they have traveled far, they have reached the
lodge, and now they have entered and are in the presence of the
Children.

**IV**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Holy visions!  
Now they cross the threshold, gliding softly  
Toward the space within;  
Softly gliding on—holy visions—  
Toward the space within.

</div>

**V**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Holy visions!  
They the lodge are filling with their presence,  
Fraught with hope and peace;  
Filling all the lodge—holy visions  
Fraught with hope and peace.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The visions which
attend the Hako are now touching the Children, touching them here and
there and by their touch giving them dreams, which will bring them
health, strength, happiness, and all good things.

**VI**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Holy visions!  
Now they touch the children, gently touch them,  
Giving dreams of joy;  
Gently touch each one—holy visions—  
Giving dreams of joy.

</div>

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> As we sing, the
visions are walking away; they have done what they came to do; they are
now leaving the lodge, and when we reach the west the space they had
filled is empty.

We pause and we think of the visions going away over the silent earth to
ascend to their dwelling place.

**VII**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Holy visions!  
Ended now their mission, pass they outward,  
Yet they leave us joy;  
Pass they all from us—holy visions—  
Yet they leave us joy.

</div>

**VIII**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Holy visions!  
They, the sky ascending, reach their dwelling;  
There they rest above;  
They their dwelling reach—holy visions—  
There they rest above.

</div>

### TENTH RITUAL

#### THE BIRTH OF DAWN

As the night draws to a close, the Kúrahus orders the server to lift the
skins which hang at the outer and inner doors of the long passageway of
the lodge, and to go outside and watch for the first glimmer of light.

At the first indication of a change, when the air begins to stir, the
server comes in with the tidings, and we rise, take up the Hako, and
stand at the west, behind the holy place; there, looking toward the
east, we sing this song. We sing it slowly and with reverent feeling,
for it speaks of the mysterious and powerful act of Tiráwa atius in the
birth of Dawn.

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

**THE SUMMONS TO MOTHER CORN**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Awake, Oh, Mother, from sleep!  
Awake! The night is far spent;  
The signs of dawn are now seen  
In east, whence cometh new life.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> We call to Mother
Earth, who is represented by the ear of corn. She has been asleep and
resting during the night. We ask her to awake, to move, to arise, for
the signs of the dawn are seen in the east and the breath of the new
life is here.

Mother Earth hears the call; she moves, she awakes, she arises, she
feels the breath of the new-born Dawn. The leaves and the grass stir;
all things move with the breath of the new day; everywhere life is
renewed.

This is very mysterious; we are speaking of something very sacred,
although it happens every day.

**THE AWAKENING OF MOTHER CORN**

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The Mother wakens from sleep;  
She wakes, for night is far spent;  
The signs of dawn are now seen  
In east, whence cometh new life.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The eagle soars
where these powers dwell and can communicate with them. The new life of
the new day is felt by these powers above as well as by Mother Earth
below.

**THE SUMMONS TO KAWAS, THE EAGLE**

**III**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Awake, oh, Kawas, from sleep!  
Awake! The night is far spent;  
The signs of dawn are now seen  
In east, whence cometh new life.

</div>

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

**THE AWAKENING OF KAWAS**

**IV**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now Kawas wakens from sleep,  
Awakes, for night is far spent;  
The signs of dawn are now seen  
In east, whence cometh new life.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> H’Kawas hears the
call and awakes. Now all the powers above wake and stir, and all things
below wake and stir; the breath of new life is everywhere. With the
signs in the east has come this new life.

Kawas, the brown eagle, the messenger of the powers above, now stands
within the lodge and speaks. The Kúrahus hears his voice as she tells
him what the signs in the east mean.

She tells him that Tiráwa atius there moves upon Darkness, the Night,
and causes her to bring forth the Dawn. It is the breath of the new-born
Dawn, the child of Night and Tiráwa atius, which is felt by all the
powers and all things above and below and which gives them new life for
the new day.

**V**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Then Kawas stands and speaks forth:  
"A child from Night is now born;  
Tiráwa, father on high,  
On Darkness moving, brings Dawn."

</div>

**VI**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"I understand now, I know  
A child from Night has been born;  
Tiráwa, father on high,  
On Darkness moving, brings Dawn."

</div>

**THE MORNING STAR AND THE NEW-BORN DAY**

We sing this song slowly with reverent feeling, for we are singing of
very sacred things.

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

The Morning Star is like a man; he is painted red all over; that is the
color of life. He is clad in leggins and a robe is wrapped about him. On
his head is a soft downy eagle's feather, painted red. This feather
represents the soft, light cloud that is high in the heavens, and the
red is the touch of a ray of the coming sun. The soft, downy feather is
the symbol of breath and life.

The star comes from a great distance, too far away for us to see the
place where it starts. At first we can hardly see it; we lose sight of
it, it is so far off; then we see it again, for it is coming steadily
toward us all the time. We watch it approach; it comes nearer and
nearer; its light grows brighter and brighter.

**INVOCATION TO THE MORNING STAR**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Oh, Morning Star, for thee we watch!  
Dimly comes thy light from distant skies;  
We see thee, then lost thou art.  
Morning Star, thou bringest life to us.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Oh, Morning Star, thy form we see!  
Clad in shining garments dost thou come,  
Thy plume touched with rosy light.  
Morning Star, thou now art vanishing.

</div>

**INVOCATION TO DAWN**

**III**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Oh, youthful Dawn, for thee we watch!  
Dimly comes thy light from distant skies;  
We see thee, then lost art thou.  
Youthful Dawn, thou bringest life to us.

</div>

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

**IV**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Oh, youthful Dawn, we see thee come!  
Brighter grows thy glowing light  
As near, nearer thou dost come.  
Youthful Dawn, thou now art vanishing.

</div>

As we sing this song the Morning Star comes still nearer and now we see
him standing there in the heavens, a strong man shining brighter and
brighter. The soft plume in his hair moves with the breath of the new
day, and the ray of the sun touches it with color. As he stands there so
bright, he is bringing us strength and new life.

As we look upon him he grows less bright, he is receding, going back to
his dwelling. place whence he came. We watch him vanishing, passing out
of our sight. He has left with us the gift of life which Tiráwa atius
sent him to bestow.

As we stand, looking through the long passageway of the lodge, watching
and singing, we see the Dawn come nearer and nearer; its brightness
fills the sky, the shadowy forms on the earth are becoming visible. As
we watch, the Dawn, like the Morning Star, recedes. It is following the
Star, going back to the place whence it came, to its birthplace.

The Day is close behind, advancing along the path of the Morning Star
and, as we watch, the Dawn vanishes from our sight.

**DAYLIGHT**

We sing this song with loud voices, we are glad. We shout, "Daylight has
come! Day is here!" The light is over the earth. As we look out through
the door of the lodge we can see the trees, and all things stand out
clearly in the light.

We call to the Children, we bid them awake and throw off the robes that
covered their heads as they slept and let their eyes look out and behold
the light of day, the day that has come, that is here.

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

**SONG OF THE JOY OF DAY**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Day is here! Day is here, is here!  
Arise, my son, lift thine eyes. Day is here! Day is here, is here!  
Day is here! Day is here, is here!  
Look up, my son, and see the day. Day is here! Day is here, is here!  
Day is here! Day is here, is here!

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Lo, the deer! Lo, the deer, the deer  
Comes from her covert of the night! Day is here! Day is here, is here!  
Lo, the deer! Lo, the deer, the deer!  
All creatures wake and see the light. Day is here! Day is here, is
here!  
Day is here! Day is here, is here!

</div>

### ELEVENTH RITUAL

#### CHANT TO THE SUN

On this, the second day of the ceremony, we remember our father the Sun.
The sun comes directly from Tiráwa atius, and whoever is touched by the
first rays of the sun in the morning receives new life and strength
which have been brought straight from the power above. The first rays of
the sun are like a young man, they have not yet spent their force or
grown old, so, to be touched by them is to receive an accession of
strength.

All the time I am singing this song I remember the Sun, the Moon, the
Stars, the Corn; all these were made by Tiráwa atius, and I ask them to
give us success and plenty; success in hunting and in war; plenty of
food, of children, and of health. The Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the
Corn, are powerful.

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

We speak of the sun as Father breathing forth life (h’Aars), causing the
earth to bring forth, making all things to grow. We think of the sun,
which comes direct from Tiráwa atius, the father of life, and his ray
(hukawi) as the bearer of this life. (You have seen this ray as it comes
through a little hole or crack.) While we sing, this ray enters the door
of the lodge to bring strength and power to all within.

The first four verses of this chant are sung in the morning; they follow
the movements of the ray. When the spot has reached the floor we stop
singing and do not begin again until the afternoon, so that our song can
accompany the ray as it leaves the lodge, touches the hills, and finally
returns to the sun.

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now behold; hither comes the ray of our father Sun; it cometh  
    over all the land, passeth in the lodge, us to touch, and give  
    us strength.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now behold, where alights the ray of our father Sun; it touches  
    lightly on the rim the place above the fire, whence the  
    smoke ascends on high.

</div>

**III**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now behold; softly creeps the ray of our father Sun; now o’er  
    the rim it creeps to us, climbs down within the lodge;  
    climbing down, it comes to us.

</div>

**IV**

Now behold; nearer comes the ray of our father Sun; it reaches  
    now the floor and moves within the open space, walking  
    there, the lodge about.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Later, when the
sun is sinking in the west, the land is in shadow, only on the top of
the hills toward the east can the spot, the

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

sign of the ray's touch, be seen. Then we sing the stanza as we go
around the lodge the third time.

The ray of Father Sun, who breathes forth life, is standing on the edge
of the hills. We remember that in the morning it had stood on the edge
of the opening in the roof of the lodge over the fireplace; now it
stands on the edge of the hills that, like the walls of a lodge, inclose
the land where the people dwell.

**V**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now behold where has passed the ray of our father Sun; around  
    the lodge the ray has passed and left its blessing there,  
    touching us, each one of us.

</div>

**VI**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now behold; softly climbs the ray of our father Sun; it upward  
    climbs, and o’er the rim it passes from the place whence  
    the smoke ascends on high.

</div>

**VII**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now behold on the hills the ray of our father Sun; it lingers  
    there as loath to go, while all the plain is dark. Now has  
    gone the ray from us.

</div>

**VIII**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now behold; lost to us the ray of our father Sun; beyond our  
    sight the ray has gone, returning to the place whence it  
    came to bring us strength.

</div>

**CHANT OF THE EAGLES**

This song likens the bustle and stir of the Hako party as it comes into
the village to the flapping of the wings of a flock of birds as they
come to a place and alight. It refers also to the birds represented on
the feathered stems—the eagle, the duck, the woodpecker, and the owl.
The noise of the wings of these birds is what is meant, for they are
moving with the Fathers toward the Children.

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

**THE WINGS OF THE MIGHTY**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Hark, the sound of their wings! Mighty birds are here now  
    alighting, bearing promised good.  
Hark, the, sound of their wings! Surely the Hako is coming.  
    Children, forward bring your gifts.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Hark, the sound of their wings! Mighty birds are here now  
    alighting, bearing promised good.  
Hark, the sound of their wings! See! The Hako has come. We  
    children forward bring our gifts.

</div>

### TWELFTH RITUAL (SECOND NIGHT)

#### THE RITES CAME BY A VISION

**FIRST SONG**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Was it, we ask, in dreams that the Fathers saw  
Clearly the Hako, wherewith I make you now  
As my son,  
My own begotten?  
Was it in dreams they learned how to make you thus  
My offspring?

Truly, in dreams it was that the Fathers saw  
Clearly the Hako, wherewith I make you now  
As my son,  
My own begotten.  
Truly, in dreams they learned how to make you thus  
My offspring.

</div>

**SECOND SONG**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

This is the teaching, this is the word sent  
Down to us from our fathers:

</div>

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

All of the wise words, all of the good gifts,  
Brought unto you as a Son,  
Verily, through a dream all of these things,  
All, by the east descended.  
This is the teaching, this is the word sent  
Down to us from our fathers:  
All of the wise words, all of the good gifts,  
Now brought to you as my Son,  
Verily, as of old, all of these things,  
All, by the east descended.

</div>

**THIRD SONG—TO THE PLEIADES**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Look as they rise, up rise  
Over the line where sky meets the earth;  
Pleiades!  
Lo! They ascending, come to guide us,  
Leading us safely, keeping us one;  
Pleiades,  
Us teach to be, like you, united.

</div>

**FOURTH SONG—OF KATASHA, THE DWELLING PLACE OF THE VISIONS**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Give heed. We tell of Katasha holy,  
Whence the dreams come down, when draweth the night time near;  
Near the gods is their dwelling,  
They who watch o’er men; all silently come they down.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Give heed! The bird of whom we are telling  
Sends the dreams to us, when draweth the night time near;  
Kawas, she that is sending  
Holy visions, bringing, silently bringing peace.

</div>

Give heed! The birds of whom we are telling  
Climb with dreams to us, when draweth the night time near;  
Down the path they are climbing;  
Where the gods to men are traveling come they down.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

They climb, these birds; a dream each is bringing;  
Bear they dreams to us, when draweth the night time near;  
Kawas—she that is sending  
Down the birds with dreams; so faithful the Hako birds!

**V**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Then back they speed, the birds that were bringing  
Down the dreams that come when draweth the night time near;  
Birds and dreams are ascending

**VI**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Mother Corn! Mother Corn! We pray thee,

Food is gone, hope is dead within us.

As I lay sleeping, as I lay dreaming,  
Out of the distance came one advancing  
One whom I ne’er had seen before, but when her voice

Lo! ’Twas our Mother, she whom we know.

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I rose from sleeping, my dream rememb’ring  
Her words I pondered, words of our mother,

Sweet smoke I offered unto our Mother.

**THE FLOCKING OF THE BIRDS**

In the early spring the birds lay their eggs in their nests, in the
summer they rear their young, in the fall all the young ones are grown,
the nests are deserted and the birds fly in flocks over the country. One
can hear the fluttering of a startled flock, the birds suddenly rise and
their wings make a noise like distant thunder. Everywhere the flocks are
flying. In the fall it seems as though new life were put into the people
as well as into the birds; there is much activity in coming and going.

When the eggs are hatched and the young are grown, the birds flock; the
promise of young has been fulfilled. In this song, which we sing toward
the close of the ceremony, we are thinking of the fulfilling of the
promise given by the Hako, that children will be granted to the people,
so that they may be many and strong, and we sing that the great flocks
are coming.

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

All around the birds in flocks are flying;  
Dipping, rising, circling, see them coming.  
See, many birds are flocking here,  
All about us now together coming.

</div>

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Yonder see the birds in flocks come flying;  
Dipping, rising, circling, see them gather.  
Loud is the sound their winging makes,  
Rushing come they on the trees alighting!

</div>

**III**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

From the flock an eagle now comes flying;  
Dipping, rising, circling, comes she hither.  
Loud screams the eagle, flying swift.  
As an eagle flies, her nestlings seeking.

</div>

**IV**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

It is Kawas coming, Kawas flying;  
Dipping rising, circling, she advances.  
See! Nearer comes she, nearer comes.  
Now, alighted, she her nest is making.

</div>

**V**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Yonder people like the birds are flocking,  
See them circling, this side, that side coming.  
Loud is the sound their moving makes,  
As together come they, onward come they.

</div>

**VI**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Toward the lodge where sits the Son they hasten,  
Bringing forward gifts with joyful shouting.  
Hark! Now they like the eagle scream,  
Glad of heart, as when her nest she seeth.

### FIFTEENTH RITUAL

#### SONGS FOR THE SIXTEEN CIRCUITS OF THE LODGE

The life of man depends upon the earth (h’Atira). Tiráwa atius works
through it. The kernel is planted within Mother Earth as she brings
forth the ear of corn, even as children are begotten and born of women.

**FIRST SONG**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Look on her! She who sought far and near for a Son!

O’er the prairie flits in ever widening circles the shadow of a  
    bird about me as I walk;

**FOURTH SONG**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Kawas flying where her nestlings now are crying; loudly cry  
    they when they hear her wings;

Quickly flying as she hears her young ones in the nest.

Kawas flying, o’er us flying, we her nestlings cry for joy as

**SIXTH SONG**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I know. not if the voice of man can reach to the sky;  
I know not if the mighty one will hear as I pray;  
I know not if the gifts I ask will all granted be;

I know not what will come to pass in our future days;  
I hope that only good will come, my children, to you.

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I now know that the voice of man can reach to the sky;

I now know that Tiráwa harkens unto man's prayer;  
I know that only good has come, my children, to you.

</div>

### SIXTEENTH RITUAL

#### (FIFTH DAY, DAWN)

**SEEKING THE CHILD**

The child referred to is usually a little son or daughter of the Son,
the man who has received the Hako party. Upon this little child we are
to put the signs of the promises which Mother Corn and Kawas bring, the
promise of children, of increase, of long life, of plenty. The signs of
these promises are put upon this little child, but they are not merely
for that particular child

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

but for its generation, that the children already born may live, grow in
strength, and in their turn increase so that the family and the tribe
may continue.

**FIRST SONG**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

With the dawn will I seek, seek my child,  
Among the Children seek  
One the gods shall here make;  
My offspring, my own child.

</div>

**SECOND SONG**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Where is he, the Son?  
Where his dwelling place that I seek?  
Which can be his lodge, where he sits  
Silent, waiting, waiting there for me?

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Here is he, the Son,  
Here his dwelling place that I seek;  
This here is his lodge where he sits  
Silent, waiting, waiting here for me.

</div>

#### SYMBOLIC INCEPTION

**FIRST SONG**

The ear of corn represents h’Uraru, Mother Earth who brings forth; the
power which causes her to bring forth is from above, and the blue paint
represents that power.

We hold the painted ear of corn toward the little child that the powers
from above and from below may come near it.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now our eyes look on him who is here;  
He is as the Son we have sought;  
He brings us again tidings of the Son:  
"Father, come to me, here I sit  
Waiting here for thee."

</div>

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

### SIXTEENTH RITUAL—PART II

#### SECOND SONG

While we sing the third stanza, the Kúrahus touches the little child on
the forehead with the ear of corn. The spirit of Mother Corn, with the
power of Mother Earth, granted from above, has touched the child.

The touch means the promise of fruitfulness to the child and its
generation.

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Tiráwa, harken! Mighty one  
Above us in blue, silent sky!  
We standing wait thy bidding here;  
The Mother Corn standing waits,  
Waits to serve thee here;  
The Mother Corn stands waiting here.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Tiráwa, harken! Mighty one  
Above us in blue, silent sky!  
We touch upon thy country fair;  
The Mother Corn touches there  
Upon the border land;  
The Mother Corn is touching there.

</div>

**III**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Tiráwa harken! Mighty one  
Above us in blue, silent sky!  
The path we reach leads up to thee;  
The Mother Corn enters there,  
Upward takes her way;  
The Mother Corn to thee ascends.

</div>

**IV**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Tiráwa, harken! Mighty one

</div>

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Above us in blue, silent sky!  
Behold! We in thy dwelling stand;  
The Mother Corn, standing there,  
Leader now is made;  
The Mother Corn is leader made.

</div>

**THIRD SONG**

This song means that it is accomplished, that the child has been
encompassed by the powers represented by the united stems. It is a
promise of procreation.

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Here stand we while upon Tiráwa now we wait;  
Here Kawas stands, her mate with her is standing here;  
They both are standing, waiting, bringing gifts with them.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

We finished are, as on Tiráwa now we wait;  
The task of Kawas with her mate accomplished is,  
And all the work they came to do is finished now.

</div>

**ACTION SYMBOLIZING LIFE**

The child, surrounded by the creative forces, is urged to move, to arise
as the first song is sung.

The four steps taken by the child represent the progress of life.

**FIRST SONG**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I am ready; come to me now, fearing nothing; come now to me here.  
Little one, come, come to me here; fearing nothing, come.

</div>

**SECOND SONG**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Stepping forward is my child, he forward steps, the four steps takes and
enters into life;  
Forward stepping, four steps taking, enters into life.

</div>

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

**THIRD SONG**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Here we go singing, looking on the child Borne in his father's arms, he
leading us;  
Follow me singing, looking on the child.

</div>

### SEVENTEENTH RITUAL

#### TOUCHING THE CHILD

On the preceding night water was taken from a stream; this water is now
put into a bowl. Every detail of this act is symbolic. The time when the
water was obtained was night, the mother of day; running water
symbolizes the continuity of life, one generation following another; the
bowl which holds the water resembles in its shape the dome of the sky,
the abode of the powers which bestow life.

The child is touched with the water upon the head and face, an invisible
outline being made, which afterward is to become distinct. The first
touching with water, one of the lesser powers, is to cleanse and give
strength.

**FIRST SONG**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Give heed, my child, lift your eyes, behold the one who is standing
here;  
Behold, my child; waiting here to bring the gift of strength to you.  
Give heed, my child. Look! Water waits to bring to you gift of strength.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Give heed, my child, lift your eyes, behold the one who has brought you
strength  
Behold, my child! Strength you have and finished is the task.  
Give heed, my child. Look! Water now has brought to you gift of
strength.

</div>

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Water is for sustenance and the maintenance of health; it is  
    one of the great gifts of Tiráwa atius.  
The white man speaks of a heavenly Father; we say Tiráwa  
    atius, the Father above, but we do not think of Tiráwa as  
    a person. We think of Tiráwa as in everything, as the  
    power which has arranged and thrown down from above  
    everything the man needs. What the power above, Tiráwa  
    atius, is like, no one knows, no one has been there.

</div>

**ANOINTING THE CHILD**

As we sing this song the old man makes the same lines upon the face of
the child as he made with the water and the brush of grass. This is in
recognition that the life which has been sustained and nourished is now
consecrated to Tiráwa atius, the Father above, who gives life to all
things.

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Give heed, my child, lift your eyes, behold the one who is standing
here,  
Behold, my child! waiting now to fit and set you here apart.  
Give heed, my child. Look! Sacred ointment now is here come to you.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Give heed, my child, lift your eyes, behold the one who has holy made.  
Behold, my child! You are set apart, and finished is the task.  
Give heed, my child. Look! Sacred ointment now has set you apart.

</div>

**SECOND SONG**

The grass of which the brush is made is gathered during a ceremony
belonging to the Rain shrine. It represents Toharu, the living covering
of Mother Earth. The power which is in Toharu gives food to man and the
animals so that they can live and

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

become strong and able to perform the duties of life. This power
represented by the brush of grass is now standing before the little
child.

While we sing this song the old man touches the forehead of the child
with the brush of grass. The power of Toharu has reached the child, has
come in contact with it to impart the strength that comes from food.

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Give heed, my child, lift your eyes, behold the one who is standing
here;  
Behold, my child! waiting here to bring the gift of food to you.  
Give heed, my child. Look! Grass now waits to bring to you gift of food.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Give heed, my child, lift your eyes, behold the one who has brought you
food.  
Behold, my child! Food you have received, and finished is the task.  
Give heed, my child. Look! Grass has now here brought you the gift of
food.

</div>

#### PAINTING THE CHILD

**FIRST SONG**

The paint symbolizes the red clouds of the dawn, the coming of the new
day, the rising sun, the vigor of life. The power of the new day, the
new life, is now standing before the child.

As we sing this song the old man touches the forehead with the red
paint. The vigor of life, the power of the touch of the sun, is now on
the child.

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Give heed, my child, lift your eyes, behold the one who is standing
here,

</div>

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Behold, my child! waiting to bring the gift of life to you.  
Give heed, my child. Look! Red paint waits, the vigor of life to bring.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Give heed, my child, lift your eyes, behold the one who has brought you
life.  
Behold, my child. Life you have received and finished is the task.  
Give heed, my child. Look. Red paint leaves the vigor of life with you.

</div>

**SECOND SONG**

Blue represents the sky, the place where Tiráwa atius dwells, and with
this blue paint we are to make upon the child a picture of the face of
Tiráwa atius. It is a mark of Tiráwa atius' acceptance of the
consecrated child and a sign of his presence. The symbol of the dwelling
place of Tiráwa atius stands before the child.

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Give heed, my child, lift your eyes, behold the one who is standing
here,  
Behold, my child! waiting here to make the sign of him above.  
Give heed, my child. Look! Blue paint waits to bring to you sign of him.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Give heed, my child, lift your eyes, behold the one who has brought the
sign,  
Behold, my child! brought to you the sign. Accomplished now the task.  
Give heed, my child. Look! Blue paint now has left with you sign of him.

</div>

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

#### PUTTING ON THE SYMBOLS

**FIRST SONG**

The down represents the high, light clouds (cirrus) in the blue of the
sky; they are near the abode of Tiráwa atius.

The down is taken from under the wings of the white eagle. The white
eagle is the mate of the brown eagle, and the child is the child of
Kawas, the brown eagle. The down grew close to the heart of the eagle
and moved as the eagle breathed. It represents the breath and life of
the white eagle, the father of the child.

While we sing this song the old man opens his hand and lets the down
fall upon the hair. The soft, white clouds near the abode of Tiráwa
atius have dropped and covered the head of the child.

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Give heed, my child, lift your eyes, behold the one who is standing
here,  
Behold, my child! waiting here to bring the sign of clouds above.  
Give heed, my child. Look! Down of eagle waits with the sign of clouds.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Give heed, my child, lift your eyes, behold the one who has laid on
you,  
Behold, my child! sign of fleecy clouds that near Tiráwa float.  
Give heed, my child. Look! Rests on you sign of the clouds above.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> We sing in the
fifth stanza that it is accomplished, the head of the consecrated child
now rests in the soft, white clouds which float near the dwelling place
of Tiráwa atius.

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

**SECOND SONG**

While we sing this song, the old man ties the downy feather on the
child's hair. Tiráwa atius is now with the little child as the double
feather waves over its head.

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Give heed, my child, lift your eyes, behold the one who is standing
here,  
Behold, my child! waiting here to bring the last, great gift to you.  
Give heed, my child. Look! Waits to bring the emblem the Father sends.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Give heed, my child, lift your eyes, behold the one who has left on
you,  
Behold, my child! left on you Tiráwa's breathing sign.  
Give heed, my child. Look! On you rests the emblem the Father sent.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Now we sing that
all is accomplished. The child has been fully prepared, the sacred
symbols put upon it, the powers from above have come, and Tiráwa atius
breathes over it.

The child is now told to look into the bowl of water and behold its
face. The running water symbolizes the passing on of generations, one
following another. The little child looks on the water and sees its own
likeness, as it will see that likeness in its children and children's
children. The face of Tiráwa atius is there also, giving promise that
the life of the child shall go on, as the waters flow over the land.

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

### EIGHTEENTH RITUAL

#### FULFILLMENT PREFIGURED

**MAKING THE NEST**

The circle represents a nest, and is drawn by the toe because the eagle
builds its nest with its claws. Although we are imitating the bird
making its nest, there is another meaning to the action; we are thinking
of Tiráwa making the world for the people to live in. If you go on a
high hill and look around, you will see the sky touching the earth on
every side, and within this circular inclosure the people live. So the
circles we have made are not only nests, but they also represent the
circle Tiráwa atius has made for the dwelling place of all the people.
The circles also stand for the kinship group, the clan, and the tribe.

The down represents the light clouds near the dwelling place of
Tiráwa—the dome of the sky over the dwelling place of the people—and it
stands for the protection of Tiráwa.

**SONG**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Behold where two eagles come forth!  
Now they soar high over head:  
See where one flies, watching, flies, guarding he  
His mate who has gone to her nest, dropping there;  
’Tis Kawas who brings there new life.

</div>

**SYMBOLIC FULFILMENT**

The child represents the young generation, the continuation of life, and
when it is put in the circle, it typifies the bird laying its eggs.

**SONG**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Within the nest the child rests its little feet,  
Awaiting there the gift sent by gods above;  
Descending there to him comes the promised life.

</div>

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

**THANK OFFERING**

An offering of sweet smoke is made to Tiráwa; then all traces of the
nest are obliterated, and the lodge is once more thrown open to the
people.

### NINETEENTH RITUAL

#### THE CALL TO THE CHILDREN

The purpose of the rite is recognized by the important place given to
children in this part of the ceremony. The ponies presented to the
Fathers are each led up by a little child; the acting out of a man's
war-like deeds is to honor his child, and the little child with the
black covering upon its head and the picture of Tiráwa upon its face
receives, with the chief, the gifts as they are presented.

In every instance the child is the tie between the two groups, the
Fathers and Children.

**FIRST SONG**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Harken! List! We are calling you. Come! Come! Children, come!  
Come! We're ready and waiting, your Father's waiting. Come! Children,
come!  
Hear us calling, calling you! Children, come!  
Children, come! Come hither!  
Harken! List as we call you, call to the Children to come.

</div>

**SECOND SONG**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Ready and waiting, we call you, loud we call you, loudly call;  
"Come to us, Children," call we loudly, call we long; Oh, come!  
Come! Come! Come!  
Hear us calling, calling, Children! Oh, come!  
Hear us calling, come to us here! Come!

</div>

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

**THIRD SONG**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Look, where they come, see them, see them, young ones and old ones!  
Look! Here they come, this way, that way flocking together.  
Hither they come, shouting like eagles,  
Shouting come.  
Joyous, happy, gladly come they, gaily coming, coming hither.  
See where they come, flocking like birds, shouting like eagles  
As they come to the Fathers.

</div>

### TWENTIETH RITUAL

#### BLESSING THE CHILD

When I sing this song I pray to Tiráwa to come down and touch with his
breath the symbol of his face and all the other symbols on the little
child. I pray with all my spirit that Tiráwa atius will let the child
grow up and become strong and find favor in its life.

This is a very solemn act, because we believe that Tiráwa atius,
although not seen by us, sends down his breath as we pray, calling on
him to come.

As I sing this song here with you I can not help shedding tears. I have
never sung it before except as I stood looking upon the little child and
praying for it in my heart. There is no little child here, but you are
here writing all these things down that they may not be lost and that
our children may know what their fathers believed and practiced in this
ceremony. So, as I sing, I am calling to Tiráwa atius to send down his
breath upon you, to give you strength and long life. I am praying for
you with all my spirit.

The purport of this song is hidden from the people, but this is what it
means: All that I have been doing to you, little child, has been a
prayer to call down the breath of Tiráwa atius to give you long life and
strength and to teach you that you belong to him—that you are his child
and not mine.

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

**SONG**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Breathe on him!  
Breathe on him!  
Life thou alone canst give to him.  
Long life, we pray, Oh Father, give unto him!

</div>

### INCIDENTAL RITUALS

#### I—COMFORTING THE CHILD

Long ago there lived a holy man who knew all the songs and the rites of
this ceremony, and to him came a vision wherein he was taught how to
bring comfort to a little child when, during the ceremony, it cried and
could not be pacified. In this vision he was shown what he must do to
bring comfort to the little child, and he heard the songs that he must
sing. The songs which he heard have been handed down through many
generations.

When during the ceremony a child cries and can not be comforted, the
mother, or someone sent by her, can approach the Kúrahus who carries the
brown-eagle stem and ask him to comfort and quiet the child. The Kúrahus
must comply with this request, so he rises and stands before the holy
place, takes up the feathered stem and sings this song, which tells the
brown eagle, Kawas, that its baby is crying.

**FIRST SONG**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Kawas, harken; thy baby is crying!  
It grieveth, wailing and weeping and crying so sore.  
Ah! It cries, cryeth so sorely;  
Kawas, hasten, thy little one cryeth so sore.

</div>

**SECOND SONG**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Father cometh, now he cometh;  
See him, little one; hark! his footsteps!

</div>

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

With him, see! coming are the eagles,  
All are coming now to thee.

</div>

**THIRD SONG**

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Look, my child, who is coming unto you;  
Look up, my little one, now your trouble goes away, away;  
Look! Above you flies one who guards you,  
Whose presence brings you joy. Now your sorrow has departed.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Ah, you look! See the eagles flying over you.  
From up above they come, from the clear blue sky where Father dwells;  
They to you this peace-bringing solace give.  
A happy little child now is smiling here light hearted.

</div>

**II—CHANGING A MAN'S NAME**

If any man of the Son's party had achieved success in war, and his
achievements had been acknowledged by the people, he could request the
Son to have the ceremony of changing his name performed.

This dramatic poem is in a rhythmic form impossible to reproduce in
English; neither is a literal translation adequate to convey its
meaning, since a single word sometimes represents a complex action, to
the understanding of which a knowledge of the customs and beliefs of the
tribe is essential. The terseness of expression was also intended to
close the meaning to the uninitiated, keeping it sacred from the common
people. Although the form of the following rhythmic rendition could not
be determined as heretofore by musical phrases, the English version
contains nothing which is not in the original text explained and
amplified by the Kúrahus.

The ritual is in three parts. The first gives a brief narration

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

of the institution of the custom of changing the name in consequence of
some new achievement. The second shows how the man was enabled to
accomplish this act. It began with his lonely vigil and fast, when he
cried to the powers for help. The scene then shifts to the circle of the
lesser powers, who, in council, deliberate on the petition which makes
its way to them and gains their consent. Then the Winds summon the
messengers, and these, gathering at the lesser powers' command, are sent
to earth to the man crying in lonely places, to grant his desire. This
part closes with a few vivid words which set forth that only by the
favor and help of the powers had the man been able to do the deed. The
third deals with the man's names, the one to be discarded and the one
now to be assumed.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Harken! ’Twas thus it came to pass:  
    In ancient days, a Leader and his men  
    Walked this wide earth, man's vast abode  
    Roofed by the heavens, where dwell the gods.  
    They reached a place, the spot no man can tell,  
    Faced dangers dread, and vanquished them:  
    Then, standing as if born anew to life  
    Each warrior threw away the name  
    That had been his ere yet these deeds were done.

Harken! The Leader and his men  
    Made there the Vict’ry Song, and set the mark!  
    Ye must o’ertake, if ye would be like them!

Harken! The Leader and his men  
Turned then toward home. Their Vict’ry Song  
Proclaimed them near; the village rose,  
Looked toward the hill, where on the top  
Stood the brave men singing their Song,  
Heralding thus the favor of the gods  
By which they had surpassed all former deeds,  
Made new their claim to be accounted men.

</div>

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Harken! And whence, think ye, was borne  
    Unto these men courage to dare,  
    Strength to endure hardship and war?  
    Mark well my words, as I reveal  
    How the gods help man's feebleness.  
    The Leader of these warriors was a man  
    Given to prayer. Oft he went forth  
    Seeking a place no one could find,  
    There would he stand, and lift his voice  
    Fraught with desire, that he might be  
    Invincible, a bulwark ’gainst all foes  
    Threat’ning his tribe, causing them fear.  
    Nighttime and day this cry sped on,  
    Traveling far, seeking to reach  
Harken! Those places far above  
Harken! Within the circle vast  
    Where sit the gods, watching o’er men.

Harken! This poor man's prayer went on,  
    Speeding afar into the blue  
    Heavens above, reached there the place—  
Harken! Where dwell the lesser gods—  
Harken! And great Tiráwa, mightier than all!

Harken! It was because a god  
    Received this prayer, considered it,  
    Favored its plea, and passed it on  
    To him whose place was next, in that grand ring,  
    Who, in his turn received the prayer,  
    Considered it, and sent it on—  
Harken! Around that circle vast—  
Harken! Where sit the gods above.

Harken! And thus it was the prayer  
    Sent by this man won the consent  
    Of all the gods. For each god in his place

</div>

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

    Speaks out his thought, grants or rejects  
    Man's suppliant cry, asking for help;  
    But none can act until the Council grand  
    Comes to accord, thinks as one mind,  
    Has but one will, all must obey.  
Harken! The Council gave consent.  
Harken! And great Tiráwa, mightier than all.

Harken! To make their purpose known,  
    Succor and aid freely to give,  
    Heralds were called, called by the Winds;  
    Then in the west uprose the Clouds  
    Heavy and black, ladened with storm.  
    Slowly they climbed, dark’ning the skies;  
    While close on every side the Thunders marched  
    On their dread way, ’till all were come  
    To where the gods in stately Council sat  
    Waiting for them. Then, bade them go  
    Back to the earth, carrying aid  
    To him whose prayers had reached their circle vast.  
    This mandate given, the Thunders turned toward earth,  
    Taking their course slantwise the sky.

Harken! Another followed hard—  
    Lightning broke forth out of the Cloud,  
    Zig-zag and dart, cleaving their way  
    Slantwise to earth, their goal to reach.

Harken! For these two were not all  
    That hastened to proclaim the gods' behest;  
    Swift on their wings, ranging the path,  
    Black breasts and red, yellow, and white,  
    Flying about, clearing the way  
    For those who bore the message of the gods  
    Granting the man courage to dare,

</div>

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Strength to endure, power to stand  
Invincible, a bulwark ’gainst all foes.

Harken! ’Twas thus it came to pass:  
    The Leader grasped the help sent by the gods;  
    Henceforth he walked steadfast and strong,  
    Leading his men through dangers drear,  
    Knowing that naught could strike at him  
    To whom the gods had promised victory.

Attend! Once more I change his name!

Harken! Rirutskatit, it was  
    We used to call him by, a name he won  
    Long days ago, marking an act  
    Well done by him, but now passed by.

Harken! Today all men shall say—

Harken! His act has lifted him  
    Where all his tribe behold a man  
    Clothed with new fame, strong in new strength,  
    Gained by his deeds, blessed by the gods.  
Harken! Shakúru Wárukote shall he be called.

### CONCLUSION

#### LAST WORDS OF TAHIRUSSAWICHI

I have done what has never been done before. I have given you all the
songs of this ceremony and explained them to you. I never thought that
I, of all my people, should be the one to give this ancient ceremony to
be preserved, and I wonder over it as I sit here.

I think over my long life with its many experiences; of the

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

great number of Pawnees who have been with me in war, nearly all of whom
have been killed in battle. I have been severely wounded many times—see
this scar over my eye. I was with those who went to the Rocky Mountains
to the Cheyennes, when so many soldiers were slain that their dead
bodies lying there looked like a great blue blanket spread over the
ground. When I think of all the people of my own tribe who have died
during my lifetime and then of those in other tribes that have fallen by
our hands, they are so many they make a vast cover over Mother Earth. I
once walked with these prostrate forms. I did not fall but I passed on,
wounded sometimes but not to death, until I am here to-day doing this
thing, singing these sacred songs and telling you of these ancient rites
of my people. It must be that I have been preserved for this purpose,
otherwise I should be lying back there among the dead.
