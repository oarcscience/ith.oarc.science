Lawn Cemetery. The Great League is the League of the five Iroquois
nations in Western New York.

**CHANT**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now, listen, Ye who established the Great  
    League,  
Now it has become old,  
Now there is nothing but wilderness.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Ye are in your graves who established it.  
Ye have taken it with you and have placed it under you,  
And there is nothing left but desert.  
There you have taken your great minds.  
That which you established, you have taken with you  
Ye have placed under your heads what ye have established,  
The Great League.

</div>

**REFRAIN**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Woe, Woe! Hearken ye!  
    We are diminished  
Woe, woe!  
    The land has become a thicket.  
Woe, woe!  
    The clear places are deserted  
    They are in their graves who established it.  
Woe, the Great League!  
    Yet they declared it should endure.  
The Great League, Woe!  
    Their work has grown old  
    We are become wretched. Woe!

</div>
