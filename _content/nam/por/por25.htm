<p align="center"><b>CHARACTER OF THE SONGS</b></p>  
<p>Some songs are self-explanatory or readily understood, but the greater number cannot be comprehended without a full knowledge of the mythology and of the symbolism to which they refer; they merely hint at mythic conceptions. Many contain archaic expressions, for which the shaman can assign a meaning,</p>  
<p><a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="green">p. 68</font></A></p>  
<p>but whose etymology cannot now be learned; and some embody obsolete words whose meaning is lost even to the priesthood. There are many vocables known to be meaningless and recited merely to fill out the rhythm or to give a dignified length to the song. For the same reasons a meaningless syllable. is often added or a significant syllable duplicated. Other poetical licenses are taken, such as the omission of a syllable, the change of accent, the substitution of one vowel for another. The most familiar words are often distorted beyond recognition. For these various reasons the task of noting and translating these songs is one of considerable difficulty. In order to simplify the meaning of certain chants repetitive phrases are set as refrains.</p>  <h4 align="center">PRELUDE</h4>  <h4 align="center">INVOCATION TO DSILYI N&#8217;EYANI</h4>
