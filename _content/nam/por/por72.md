### LONE-DOG UNTO THE DELAWARES

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Brothers—Lennapi,  
Hear ye, come ye, all ye—  
By south-way, east-way, shore-land place,  
Men come,  
Boats come,  
Float fast,  
Handsome.  
Man-who-Paints, much-talker, he much-walked  
Easterly, south also,  
All-time stalked—  
Friends they, he says,  
Sun-rise men, sun-born men, east-coming;  
Great things have, wonderful, thundering  
Yea, great things, hear we, from clam-clam-sea—  
Hear ye—  
White-bird boat, great eagle, floats up streams,  
Man-carrying, house-bearing, much-fire gleams.  
Friends they,  
Say they,  
Come ye, hear ye, all ye,  
Brothers there, cousins there, Lennapi,  
Turtle men, turkey men, wolf clan,

Let us running-friendly be,  
Let us brother-hearted be,  
Giver-brothers standing we,  
Men with meat, men with hides, everyman,  
Come ye, run ye, all ye.  
From Branchy-river-place,  
From Straightened-river-place,  
From Great-falls-at,  
From Shore-land-at,  
Sassafras-land.  
Many caves men,  
Riding waves men,  
All ye Wolves, Turtles, Lennapi—  
Bring your gifts, laying them  
At Clam-clam-sea.
