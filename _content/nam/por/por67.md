#### A SONG IN TIME OF DEPRESSION

**FROM THE PAIUTE**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now all my singing Dreams are gone  
But none knows where they are fled  
Nor by what trail they have left me.

Return, O Dreams of my heart,  
And sing in the summer twilight,  
By the creek and the almond thicket  
And the field that is bordered with lupins!

Now is my refuge to seek  
In the hollow of friendly shoulders,  
Since the singing is stopped in my pulse  
And the earth and the sky refuse me;  
Now must I hold by the eyes of a friend  
When the high white stars are unfriendly.

Over sweet is the refuge of trusting;  
Return and sing, O my Dreams,  
In the dewy and palpitant pastures,  
Till the love of living awakes  
And the strength of the hills to uphold me.

</div>
