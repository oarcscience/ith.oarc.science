<p>After the rushing waters had subsided<br> The Len&acirc;p&eacute; of the Turtle were close together,<br> In hollow houses, living together there.<br> It freezes where they abode:<br> It snows where they abode:<br> It storms where they abode:<br> It is cold where they abode.<br> At this northern place they speak favorably<br> Of mild, cool lands<br> With many deer and buffaloes.<br> As they journeyed, some being strong,<br> Some being rich, they separated<br> Into house-builders and hunters:<br> The hunters showed themselves at the north:<br> The hunters showed themselves at the east:<br> The hunters showed themselves at the south:<br> The hunters showed themselves at the west.<br> In that ancient country, in that northern country,<br> In that Turtle country<br> The best of Len&acirc;p&eacute; were the Turtle-men.<br> All the cabin fires of that land were disquieted<br> And all said, "Let us go."</p>
