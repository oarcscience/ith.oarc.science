#### ALONG THE SOUTH STAR TRAIL: TRIBAL SONGS FROM THE SOUTHWEST

**THE TOM-TOM**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

    Drum-beat, beat of drums,  
Pebble-rattle in the gourd,  
Pebble feet on drifting sand…  
Drum-beat, beat of drums  
I have lost the wife-made robe of bearskin…  
Take the prize—mine the loss.  
Have I lost too the courage of the black bear—  
His power, his thunder?  
Lul-la-by,  
Games' queer lullaby…  
O robe of mine!—  
O luck of mine!

    Drum-beat, beat of drums,  
Pebble-rattle in the gourd,  
Coyote feet upon the plain…  
Drum-beat, beat of drums—  
Coyotes crushed the tender ham-string and the bone…  
A bull-calf bawls, dies alone.  
Where are the herds of buffalo and the hides,  
The meat, the tepees?  
Lul-la-by,  
Man's dread lullaby…  
O home of mine!  
O life of mine!

    Drum-beat, beat of drums,  
Pebble-rattle in the gourd,  
Horse-hoof beat upon the ground…  
Drum-beat, beat of drums  
By Wounded Knee ye buried them, buried them—  
Red men's flesh, their bones…

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

By Wounded Knee we buried them, buried them.  
The songs we sung, the dreams…  
Lul-la-by,  
The white man's lullaby…  
O race of mine!  
O brothers mine!

    Drum-beat, beat of drums,  
Pebble-rattle in the gourd,  
Pulse-beat in the fever…  
Drum-beat, beat of drums—  
Famine drank from the gourd bottle, ate the gourd;  
Left the skin, the bone.  
She walked the pathway from the east, of the departed—  
Left me forsaken, alone…  
Lul-la-by,  
Tiráwa's long lullaby…  
O blood of mine!  
O child of mine!

    Drum-beat, beat of drums,  
Pebble-rattle in the gourd.  
Still feet in the grave-mound…  
Drum-beat, beat of drums—  
The gourd-rattle handle leads to the sun and life;  
Leaves clay, leaves cold.  
A purple smoke arises from bowl to float on winds;  
Leaves ashes—my ash…  
Lul-la-by,  
Death's sweet lullaby…  
O flesh of mine!  
O hands of mine!

    Drum-beat, beat of drums,  
Pebble-rattle in the gourd,  
Dream-feet in the yellow line…  
Drum-beat, beat of drums—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

One half the feather of Tiráwa's bird is white;  
The other black—’tis night;  
Tiráwa's song at night is morning star of dawn  
Where dance dreams, in light…  
Lul-la-by,  
The spirit's lullaby…  
O soul of mine!  
O breath of mine!

    Drum-beat, beat of drums,  
Pebble-rattle in the gourd,  
Calves' feet in starry plains…  
Drum-beat, beat of drums—  
A sacred herd graze on tips of fair fresh flowers  
In garden—Star of Evening's.  
A bison drinks mixed all-waters, pure  
From Spring; ’tis hers…  
Lul-la-by,  
All-Life's lullaby…  
O land of mine!  
O plains of mine!

    Drum-beat, beat of drums,  
Pebble-rattle in the gourd,  
Dance-feet ’round the sun…  
Drum-beat, beat of drums—  
By the sun see the dancing white men with the red—  
By Wounded Knee, a post!  
There they blend their songs together, brother-wise;  
Here the post, the paint…  
Lul-la-by,  
The Nation's lullaby…  
O race of mine!  
O brothers mine!

    Drum-beat, beat of drums,  
Pebble-rattle in the gourd,

Child feet in the hogan…  
Drum-beat, beat of drums—  
A child has taught her little spider pet to weave  
Bead-work at my door;  
A child has taught these dimming eyes to see  
Thread-work, star-lit lodge…  
Lul-la-by,  
Love's own lullaby…  
O hogan mine!  
O hogan thine!

    Drum-beat, beat of drums,  
Pebble-rattle in the gourd,  
Soul-feet in trail of wind…  
Drum-beat, beat of drums—  
Hear the great sea-feet, beating on the flint-rock!  
Drum-beat, beat of drum—  
Hear the beat of distant feet on South Star Trail!  
Drum-beat, beat of drum—  
Ti-rá-wa!  
Earth's great Ti-rá-wa.  
O heart-beat thine!  
O drum-beat thine!
