### CALLING-ONE'S-OWN

**OJIBWA**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Awake! flower of the forest, sky-treading bird of the prairie.  
Awake! awake! wonderful fawn-eyed One.  
When you look upon me I am satisfied; as flowers that drink dew.  
The breath of your mouth is the fragrance of flowers in the morning,  
Your breath is their fragrance at evening in the moon-of-fading-leaf.  
Do not the red streams of my veins run toward you  
As forest-streams to the sun in the moon of bright nights?  
When you are beside me my heart sings; a branch it is, dancing,  
Dancing before the Wind-spirit in the moon of strawberries.  
When you frown upon me, beloved, my heart grows dark—  
A shining river the shadows of clouds darken,  
Then with your smiles comes the sun and makes to look like gold  
Furrows the cold wind drew in the water's face.  
Myself! behold me! blood of my beating heart.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Earth smiles—the waters smile—even the sky-of-clouds smiles—but I,  
I lose the way of smiling when you are not near,  
Awake! awake! my beloved.

</div>
