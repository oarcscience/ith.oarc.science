<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My eyes I will not cover!<br> I am Pai-iya, stepping free on the goathills behind thy village.<br> Blue shadows and white mists, like flowers,<br> Lie deep in thy green forests.<br> Night lingers in thy hair;<br> Pools of starred dusk are thine eyes.<br> Thy speech is gray fog, impenetrable,<br> Shrouding the port of the crimson lure&#8212;<br> (The ships of the trusting one are broken.)<br> Oh, flower-red is thy girdle at morning and evening!<br> If it were loosened there would be a race of men,<br> And thou the harbor of a thousand wondering ships.<br> I have lifted dawn before me as a shield,<br> Swi-ya Kwen-e-we-sals!</div></p>

<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Raven pecks beside thy door;<br> On thy roof the Thunder-Bird claps his wings;<br> Thy smile darkles across the skies.<br> Thy smile is death&#8212;<br> My heart is the riven sea beneath.<br> If thy scarlet girdle were unknotted would it stem the sea of my wound?<br> Nay! Call not me with the wind blowing through thy garments!<br> I have bound the mountains to my feet,<br> Swi-ya Kwen-e-we-sals!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night I saw winged stars in flight<br> Circling o&#8217;er thy dwelling.<br> They swung at rest on the points of the shore pine&#8212;<br> Torches red-spanning the bay.<br> My wolves, at my call,<br> In long gray troops fled up from the forest.<br> They sphered in guard about me&#8212;sleeping on my shield<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poised on the four world-crags&#8212;<br> As darkened silver cloud-mists wind about the moon.<br> I have shepherded them into the canyon between us&#8212;<br> (But my eyes I will not cover!)<br> Wilt thou come, daring, among my fanged flocks,<br> Swi-ya Kwen-e-we-sals?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this warmth stealing to my height<br> Like footsteps of a strange desire?<br> Wave on wave of pink and gold breaks over the white;<br> The petals open, chirring,<br> As if they were feathers on the Song-bird's swelling throat.<br> My wolves, with heads hanging and fangs covered, slowly moving, moving,<br> Huddle in the valley like sky-shadows before rain.<br> Whose steps flow and ripple over the dark moss,<br> Parting the green walls of cedars,</div></p>

<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Blossoming among my mating flocks?<br> Whence this unraveling of flame blown loose across the air?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My eyes I will not cover!<br> I have woven thongs of the mountain mists<br> And bound me to the morning star.<br> Between the cliffs of Night and Day, thou emergest!&#8212;<br> Thy sod-brown bosom, the mystical craving eyes above;<br> The yearning fragrance of thy closed hands,<br> The wild winds between thy feet,<br> And the rivers under thy girdle!<br> I have cast down the great shield of the dawn!<br> Come, redden its rim with me,<br> Swi-ya Kwen-e-we-sals!</div></p>
