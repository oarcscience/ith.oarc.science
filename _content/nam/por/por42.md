#### HAIDA CRADLE SONGS

**I**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Again perhaps you expect to sit up high in your father's canoe <span
id="fr_5"></span>[\*](#fn_5)  
    chief-woman, and look around upon all things  
    in front of Upset-Canoe.  
Be careful, be careful, chief-woman!

</div>

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Again perhaps you expect to sit up high in your father's canoe,  
    chief-woman, and look around the place  
    whence abalones come.  
Be careful, be careful, chief-woman.

</div>

**II**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Perhaps you are crying and crawling  
    to get your grandmother's hand  
    which was hurt on a wooden tray with square sides, I hear;  
    for that you are crying and crawling  
    chief-woman, chief-woman,  
    crying and crawling.

</div>

**III**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Whence have you fallen, have you fallen?  
Whence have you fallen, have you fallen?  
Did you fall, fall, fall, fall,  
    from the top of a salmonberry bush?

</div>

**IV**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Stop crying, chief's child! Stop crying, chief's child!  
I do not expect that drums will sound again for you, chief's  
    child, if it is for that you are crying and wriggling.  
Stop crying, great chief's child, a child of noble family sits  
    quietly.  
Now, now, great chief's child; a child of noble family sits  
    quietly.  
Stop crying, chief's child! Stop crying, chief's child!  
I do not expect that they are going to lay heavy planks for  
    you again, chief's child; if it is for that you are crying and  
    wriggling.  
Stop crying, great chief's child, a child of noble family sits  
    quietly.  
Now, now, great chief's child; a child of noble family sits  
    quietly.

</div>

**V**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

One sits here like a common person facing the woods  
Say, stop telling lies!  
Your mouth will be crooked  
    you mosquito-people-trash!

</div>

**VI**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

In your father's house, your father's house  
    Cape Qóna seagulls eating things  
    are making cries.  
In the midst of all these things  
    you are going to move  
    proudly as you sit.

</div>

**VII**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Come, let us take it on our knees!  
    Come, let us take it on our knees!  
Hand it to one another inside of its father's house,  
    hand it to one another!  
Come, let us take it on our knees!  
    Come, let us take it on our knees!

</div>

**VIII**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

At that time when my child  
    goes about as a youth  
    vainly alone  
    I shall sit around.  
His son  
    making a great noise  
    went by on the water.  
I wonder where he is going!  
His son  
    making a great noise  
    went by on the water.  
It must be to the North islands.

</div>

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

**IX**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Did you make up your mind  
    to fall into the cradle  
    to fall into the cradle  
    to fall in from the top of a spruce-tree?  
    to fall in from the top of a salmonberry bush?

</div>

**X**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Be careful, my noble sons!  
    you will grow to one another like leaves.  
Be careful, my own chief!  
    Be careful, my own chief!

</div>

**XI**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Are you crying for this, chief?  
Are you crying for this, chief?  
Are you crying to have your sisters  
    put you up higher, chief?  
Crying for your cousins to make the people  
    as numerous in front of you  
    as when people make seagulls cry,  
    being obliged to step on them,  
For these things are you crying, chief?

</div>

**XII**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

You came to me, you came to me, ye he  he!  
You came to me, you came to me.  
You came walking to me, calling me "mother,"  
    instead of to someone else.  
To me my child, who is a chief's child,  
    came walking, calling me "mother,"  
Mother of noble family,  
Mother of noble family, mother of noble family,  
    mother of noble family, mother of noble family.

**XIII**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Why does he cry softly?  
Why does he wriggle as he sits?  
He wriggles and cries for grandfather's house.

</div>

**XIV**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

It is not now as it was in olden times.  
Even slaves are beginning to own good abalone-shells!

</div>

**XV**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Dogs, even,  
    when they have pups  
    to them give their love.  
That is why  
    mine I love.

</div>

**XVI**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Still stands  
    Skîlsîs town.  
Do not cry  
    upon my knees!

</div>

**XVII**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Why is it  
    your slave close by  
    (even I, your mother!)  
    you want something you cannot get, you say?  
You are very foolish,  
    uncle reborn,  
    I bore.

</div>

**XVIII**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

My child says:  
    Look around at the waves,—  
Then she fools me  
    with unripe salmonberries.

</div>

**XIX**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Behind Sea-Lion Town  
    I was looking around a while;  
    the future chief I found,  
    just big enough to walk.  
Take care, take care, my own chief!  
Take care, my own master!

</div>

**XX**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Women are better than men,  
    women are better than men.  
Women have more property.  
Chiefs of my family,  
    where are you?

</div>

**XXI**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Upon his grandmother's land  
    my child walks proudly.  
For that his foot is dear.  
Do not cry!

</div>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_5"></span>[138:\*](por42.htm#fr_5) Chiefs' children used to
be placed high up on blankets in the center of trading canoes so that
they could look about. Here the baby is reminded of what she used to do
in a former existence.
