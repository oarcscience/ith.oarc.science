The small grasses grow about thee, e&ccedil;ka<br> Thou sittest as though making of them thy dwelling place, e&ccedil;ka<br> He!

<p>This shall be the legend<br> Of the people of yore, the red people,<br> Thus my little ones shall speak of me.<br> Then next in rank stood the male gray wolf, whose cry,<br> Though uttered without effort, verily made the earth to tremble,<br> Even the stable earth to tremble.<br> Such shall be the legend of the people.<br> Then next in rank stood Hega, the buzzard, with his red neck.<br> Calmly he stood, his great wings spread, letting the heat of the sun straighten his feathers.<br> Slowly he flapped his wings,</p>

<p align="center"><b>THE GHOST-DANCE RELIGION</b></p>  
<p>In 1892 the last serious Indian outbreak occurred. This was occasioned by the government's efforts to suppress the practices of a new religion which, during the two years preceding, had spread over a large part of, the west, among the Indian tribes from the Plains to the Coast, and from the Columbia to the Rio Grande. The Prophet of this new cult claimed to be the Messiah, and professed to exercise divine powers. He instituted certain dances, which his followers, in a vain attempt to overthrow the world-order magically, perverted into frenzied rites, wherein entranced, they saw visions and spoke with the dead. The Messiah concept is an ancient one in Indian mythology, antedating all Christian influence, and so desperate had become the straits of the Vanishing Race that these doctrines received wide acceptance. At length the government intervened and brought the strange worship to an end.</p>  
<p>Mr. James Mooney investigated this interesting phenomenon and actually discovered the Seer, who proved to be an inoffensive visionary dwelling in a remote valley of the Southwest. This young man's life and theories (a full-blood, apparently untouched by Christian influence), curiously resembled those of Christ, and like the latter, he preached the doctrines of Nonresistance and the Brotherhood of Man. In this case our government played the part of Rome.</p>

<p>These songs were sung during the dancing, and express in the image of the Whirlwind, a mystic and exalted contemplation of the approaching Great Change. Unessential repetitions have been omitted for brevity's sake.</p>
