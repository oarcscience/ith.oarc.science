### SEDNOR AND THE FULMAR

#### AN ESKIMO BALLAD

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

(Recitative)  
Where is she  
    who would never marry?  
In a kayok to the mainland  
    going away.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Dost thou see, my eyes,  
    dost thou see them?  
Ia, ha, ha, ha, ha!  
To a tent of ragged skins,  
    he has brought her, crying;  
*    (the Fulmar, her husband)  
*Her father with her elder brother  
    in a boat coming;  
*    (he, seeking his daughter)  
*In a boat his daughter embarked.  
Her husband, the Fulmar, cried:  
*    (thus the Magician!)  
*The Fulmar says: "My means for transforming  
    let me see them as they are;  
    let me see them once more."  
Now they are taking the woman back;  
    to the tent going home;  
    the Fulmar followed,  
*    (thus the Magician!)  
*Wind very strong to come near them;  
*    (he made, the Magician!)  
*    they were shipwrecked, nearly.  
*    (Her father fears death!)  
*His daughter he pushes  
    into the sea.  
To the boat on both sides—  
    to the boat she clings.  
*    (Still followed, the Fulmar!)  
*With a knife he struck her;  
    whales emerged.  
Again he struck her;  
    a thong seal emerged.  
Again he struck her;  
    a fiord seal emerged.  
*    (thus the Magician!)  
*Her whole body she leaned.  

    (Sednor, fearing death!)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

With a knife into the eyes  
    he stabbed her;  
He killed her.  
*    (Thus the Fulmar, the Magician!)*  
On the shore  
    her father lifted her.  
A quilt he took;  
    on the beach laid her down.  
With a dog skin she was covered,  
*    (Sednor, the Beautiful)*  
The flood-tide took her.

(Based on a literal translation.)
