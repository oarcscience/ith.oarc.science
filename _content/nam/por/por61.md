#### THE SONG OF THE HILLS

**FROM THE YOKUT**

**BEING THE SONG OF A MAN AND A WOMAN WHO MIGHT HAVE LOVED**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

This is the song of the Hills  
In the hour when they talk together,  
When the alpen glow dies down in the west and leaves the heavens
tender;  
In the pure and shadowless hour  
When the Mountains talk together;

"Fir tree leaneth to fir,  
The wind-blown willows mingle;

</div>

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Clouds draw each to each, dissolve, depart, and renew one another;  
But the strong Hills hold asunder.

"Had we been less we had loved;  
We had stooped and been tender;

"But our hands are under the earth  
For the travail of her harvests,  
Upholding the rain-sleeked fields  
And the long, brown, fruitful furrow.  
Terror taketh the earth  
When the Mountains move together.

"But ever as winds of Spring  
Set the meadow grasses caressing,  
And the coo-dove's call.  
To the coo-dove's mate  
Resounds in the oak-wood valleys,  
We shall thrill with the brooding earth,  
We shall turn, touch hands, and remember,  
Had we been less, how much we had loved  
How nobly we might have been tender."

</div>
