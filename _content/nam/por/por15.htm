<p>H&ucirc;! Listen! In Alah&iacute; yi you repose, O Terrible Woman,<br> O you have drawn near to hearken.<br> There in Elahiyi you are at rest, a White Woman.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1"></A><A HREF="#fn_1"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A><br> No one, is ever lonely when with you.<br> You are most beautiful.<br> Instantly and at once you have rendered me a white man.<br> No one is ever lonely when with me.<br> Now you have made the path white for me.<br> It shall never be dreary.<br> Now you have put me into it.<br> It shall never become blue.<br> You have brought down to me from above the white road.<br> There in mid-earth you have placed me.<br> I shall stand erect upon the earth.<br> No one is ever lonely when with me.<br> I am very handsome.<br> You have put me into the white house.<br> I shall be in it as it moves about and no one with me shall ever be lonely.<br> Verily, I shall never become blue.<br> Instantly you have caused it to be so with me.</p>  
<p>And now there in Elahiyi you have rendered the woman blue.<br> Now you have made the path blue for her.<br> Let her be completely veiled in loneliness.<br> Put her into the blue road.<br> And now bring her down.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="green">p. 34</font></A></p>  
<p>Place her standing upon the earth.<br> Where her feet are now and wherever she may go, let loneliness leave its mark upon her.<br> Let her be marked out for loneliness where she stands.</p>  
<p>Ha! I belong to the Wolf clan, that one alone which was allotted into for you.<br> No one is ever lonely with me.<br> I am handsome.<br> Let her put her soul in the very center of my soul, never to turn away.<br> Grant that, in the midst of men she shall never think of them.<br> I belong to the one clan alone which was allotted for you when the seven clans were established.</p>  
<p>Where other men live it is lonely.<br> They are very loathsome.<br> The common polecat has made them so like himself that they are fit only for his company.<br> They have become mere refuse.<br> They are very loathsome.<br> The common opossum has made them so like himself that they are fit only to be with him.<br> They are very loathsome.<br> Even the crow has made them so like himself that they are fit only for his company.<br> They are very loathsome.<br> The miserable rain-crow has made them so like himself that they are fit only for his company.</p>  
<p>The seven clans all alike make one feel very lonely in their company.<br> They are not even good looking.<br> They go about clothed with mere refuse.<br> They even go about covered with dung.<br> But I&#8212;I was ordained to be a white man.</p>  
<p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="green">p. 35</font></A></p>  
<p>I stand with my face toward the Sun Land.<br> No one is ever lonely with me.<br> I am very handsome.<br> I shall certainly never become blue.<br> I am covered by the everlasting white house wherever I go.<br> No one is ever lonely with me.<br> Your soul has come into the center of my soul, never to turn away.<br> I, Gatigwan asti&#8212;I take your soul.<br> Sge!</p>

<p align="center"><b>TO INSURE CONSTANCY</b></p>  
<p>Listen! O, now you have drawn near to harken, O, Ancient One.<br> This woman's soul has come to rest at the edge of your body.<br> You are never to let go your hold upon it.<br> It is ordained that you shall do just as you are requested to do.<br> Let her never think upon any other place.<br> Her soul has faded within her.<br> She is bound by the black threads.</p>  
<p align="center"><b>III</b></p>  
<p>Listen! "Ha! Now the souls have met, never to part," you have said, O Ancient One above.<br> O Black Spider, you have brought down from on high.<br> You have let down your web.<br> She is of the Deer clan; her name is Ay&acirc;sta.<br> Her soul you have wrapped up in your web.<br> Listen! Ha! But now you have covered her with loneliness.</p>  
<p>Her eyes have faded.<br> Whither can her soul escape?<br> Let her be sorrowing as she goes along, and not for one night alone.</p>  
<p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="green">p. 36</font></A></p>  
<p>Let her become an aimless wanderer, whose trail may never be followed.<br> O Black Spider, may you hold her soul in your web so that it shall never get through the meshes.<br> What is the name of the soul?<br> They two have come together.<br> It is mine!</p>  
<p>Listen! Ha! And now you have harkened,<br> O Ancient Red.<br> Your grandchildren have come to the edge of your body.<br> You hold them yet more firmly in your grasp, never to let go your hold.<br> O Ancient One, we have become as one.<br> The woman has put her soul into our hands.<br> We shall never let it go!<br> Yu!</p>  
<p align="center"><b>IV</b></p>  
<p align="center"><b>TO DESTROY LIFE</b></p>  
<p>Listen! Now I have come to step over your soul<br> You are of the Wolf clan.<br> Your name is A&#8217;y&ucirc;&#8217;nini.<br> Your spittle I have put at rest under the earth.<br> I have come to cover you over with the black rock.<br> I have come to cover you over with the black cloth.<br> I have come to cover you over with the black slabs, never to reappear.<br> Toward the black coffin of the upland in the Darkening Land your paths shall stretch out.<br> So shall it be for you.<br> The clay of the upland has come to cover you.<br> Instantly the black clay has lodged there where it is at rest at the black houses in the Darkening Land.<br> With the black coffin and with the black slabs I have come to cover you.</p>  
<p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="green">p. 37</font></A></p>  
<p>Now your soul has faded away.<br> It has become blue.<br> When darkness comes your spirit shall grow less and dwindle away, never to reappear.<br> Listen!</p>  
<p align="center"><b>V</b></p>  
<p align="center"><b>THOSE ABOUT TO BE SLAIN</b></p>  
<p>Ha yi! Y&ucirc;! Listen!<br> Now instantly we have lifted up the red war club.<br> Quickly his soul shall be without motion.<br> There under the earth, where the black war clubs shall be moving about like ball sticks in the game, there his soul shall be, never to reappear.<br> We cause it to be so.<br> He shall never go and lift up the war club.<br> We cause it to be so.<br> There under the earth the black war club and the black fog have come together as one for their covering.<br> The black fog shall never be lifted from them.<br> We cause it to be so.</p>
