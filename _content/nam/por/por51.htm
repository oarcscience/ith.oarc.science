<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I descend through the forest alone.<br> Rose-flushed are the willows, stark and a-quiver,<br> In the warm sudden grasp of Spring;<br> Like a woman when her lover has suddenly, swiftly taken her.<br> I hear the secret rustle of the little leaves,<br> Waiting to be born.<br> The air is a wind of love<br> From the wings of eagles mating&#8212;<br> O eagles, my sky is dark with your wings!<br> The hills and the waters pity me,<br> The pine-trees reproach me.<br> The little moss whispers under my feet,<br> "Son of Earth, Brother,<br> Why comest thou hither alone?"</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the wolf has his mate on the mountain&#8212;<br> Where art thou, Spring-daughter?<br> I tremble with love as the reeds by the river,<br> I burn as the dusk in the red-tented west,<br> I call thee aloud as the deer calls the doe,<br> I await thee as hills wait the morning,<br> I desire thee as eagles the storm;<br> I yearn to thy breast as night to the sea,<br> I claim thee as the silence claims the stars.<br> O Earth, Earth, great Earth,<br> Mate of God and mother of me,</div></p>
