<p>"Ho, younger brother! the children have no bodies," he was saying.<br> "We must seek bodies for our children."<br> They reached the second upper world and stood.<br> There they were not human beings.<br> "Ho, younger brother! the children have no bodies," he was saying.<br> "We must seek bodies for our children."<br> They reached the third upper world and stood.<br> There they were not human beings.<br> "Ho, younger brother! the children have no bodies," he was saying.<br> "We must seek bodies for our children."<br> They reached the fourth upper world and stood.<br> There they became human beings.<br> Still, the children were without (human) bodies.<br> "We must continue to seek bodies for our children."<br> They returned to the third upper world and stood.<br> The children were really without bodies.<br> "Ho, younger brother! the children have no bodies," he was saying.<br> "We must continue to seek bodies for our children."<br> They returned to the second upper world and stood.<br> The children did not find bodies for themselves.<br> "Ho, younger brother! the children have no bodies," he was saying.<br> "We must make an examination awhile longer."<br> They returned to the first upper world and stood.<br> They came to red oak and were standing on it.<br> On a very fine day they came hither and stood.<br> Kaxe-wah&uuml;-sa (the Black Bear), who was then moving,<br> Came directly to them and stood.<br> "Ho, elder brother!" (said the Black Bear.)<br> "You shall continue to burn my feet for me."<br> "Ho, Kaxe-wah&uuml;-sa!" was he (the Tsicu) saying.<br> Kaxe-wah&uuml;-sa went to the star Watse-tuka.<br> "Ho, grandfather!" he was saying.</p>
