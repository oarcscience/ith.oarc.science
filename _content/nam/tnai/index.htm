Stith Thompson, a Distinguished Professor of English
and Folklore at Indiana University, anthologized these
Native American tales from the ethnographic literature.
His chief contribution to the field was his 'Motif-Index of
Folk Literature', which is a cross-cultural index of themes
that occur in folktales.</P>
<P>
Reading through the traditional folk stories of
<A HREF="../../afr/index">Africa</A>,
<A HREF="../../neu/index">Europe</A>,
and 
<A HREF="../../nam/index">Native America</A>,
it becomes obvious
that there are a broad set of motifs that are appear
across geographic boundaries.
Is this evidence of diffusion or something buried deeper in our
cultural matrix that goes back to our common origins?
This is still a mystery.</P>
<P>
Stories where virtue is rewarded, evil step-relations plot
against the rightful heir, anthropomorphic animals play
out very human dramas, and so on, soon blur together.
There are also stories with violent, brutal, bawdy or transgressive
sexual elements.
Not all folklore is suitable for children!</P>
<P>
Westerners have been schooled by Shakespeare and TV sitcoms
to expect that all stories will conclude
in the final act with all of the loose ends tied up.
This isn't always the case in the dream-like landscape of the folktale.</P>
<P>
Some folklore stories seem to go nowhere, or end
in a conclusion that seems unsatisfying, or have
repetitive episodes that appear to be added just to fill out
the story.
In modern literature, a story must either be
a tragedy or a comedy; most folklore has elements of both.
Folklore often violates our modern expectations
of how a story should be shaped, while keeping us riveted,
wanting to hear more.
In this way folklore is much closer to real life, where 'stuff' happens,
at random and often without any apparent internal logic.</P>
<P>
Stith Thompson's contribution was to attempt to make sense of
this mass of material.
This seminal book, which appears on the Internet for the
first time at Sacred Texts, is his take on the Native American
folklore corpus.</P>

This text is believed to be in the public domain in the United States.
The book was originally published in 1929, and was not renewed
in a timely fashion (per the <A HREF="https://www.kingkong.demon.co.uk/ccer/ccer">Catalog of Copyright Renewals</A>).
Hence it entered the public domain in 1957.
This is reflected in the Midland paperback edition of 1966,
which bears no copyright notice.  The text was scanned from the
Midland paperback edition.
