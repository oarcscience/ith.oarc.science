<p>A COYOTE who was very hungry was walking about the outskirts of a field. He was discovered by a few dogs who were taking care of the crops. With the dogs were some little quail. This was in the time when animals talked like people and all of them understood one another.</p>  
<p>The dogs talked to the coyote in such a way as not to frighten him, saying, "Brother, come along with us. It looks as if you are quite hungry."</p>  
<p>"Poor little coyote," said the quail, with voices which showed their pity. "It is obvious that you are very hungry."</p>  
<p>The coyote, thinking that they were going to give him something to eat, went with them. He walked along surrounded with dogs, for there were many dogs, and the quail followed behind him singing:</p>  
<p><DIR><i>&#146;ama mele wo'i<br> wo'i taka &#146;ama mel</i>e.</DIR></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Thus the little quail sang to the coyote. But he did not like it, this song.</p>  
<p>"Why do you sing this <i>&#146;ama mele wo'i</i>?" the coyote asked,</p>  
<p>"Oh, don't worry about that," said the dogs, "that is just a song." But the words of the song meant, "For the last time you are a coyote." This they sang because they were taking him off to kill him.</p>  
<p>Before they arrived at the houses the dogs set up a great noise and barking. Men came out of the houses, but the coyote couldn't run because he was surrounded by dogs. The men took him off to where they lit a great fire, and into it they threw the poor coyote. Here ends the story.</p>
