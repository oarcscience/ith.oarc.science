### Cho'oko Baso

NEAR the hill of Maatale lived a Yaqui named Cho'oko Baso who worked at
collecting bark from trees with which to make dyes and to tan hides. The
hides he sold for fruit and roots with which to feed his sons.

One day he was walking over a stretch of coarse sand and, on passing
close to a cliff very late in the evening, he saw in the middle of the
cliff a white light. But he saw no windows or doors. He was standing
there for some time when suddenly there appeared before him an elderly
man in a long shirt, a sort of tunic, and the man asked him, "What do
you search for?"

Cho'oko Baso replied, "I walk here in search of woods for use in tanning
hides."

"But look," said the old man, "don't work so hard. Take this little
stick and touch that rock."

Cho'oko Baso did so, and the rock opened before him: A beautiful girl
appeared and said to him, "Take this little stick. When you find
yourself in need, tell it to give food to your sons. Say, 'Give me
money' and it will be given to you."

This is what Cho'oko Baso did. And from then on he was very rich.

But it is said that after some twenty years, Cho'oko Baso was passing by
that same place and to him appeared the same old man. And the old man
told him to go over to that same rock. "Touch that rock with the stick,"
the old man said as before.

And Cho'oko Baso did this. And the young woman appeared as before and
said, "Come in."

Cho'oko Baso went inside the rock to remain there enchanted, forever.

Now when Yaquis pass by that place they turn their heads away.
