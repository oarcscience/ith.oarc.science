<p>ONE TIME San Pedro and Jesucristo were walking along, and Jesucristo sent San Pedro up to a near-by house to get a cooked chicken. On the way back Pedro ate one leg of the chicken.</p>  
<p>When Jesucristo saw what San Pedro had brought back, he asked, "Why has this chicken but one leg?"</p>  
<p>"It never had another leg," answered Pedro. "All of the chickens around this part of the country have but one leg, Sir."</p>  
<p>The two proceeded and came to a big tree under which were sleeping many chickens. All of the chickens had one leg tucked up out of sight under their feathers.</p>  
<p>Pedro pointed to them and said, "You see! All of the chickens have but one leg apiece."</p>  
<p>Jesucristo took a rock and threw it at one of the chickens. It woke up and stood on both feet.</p>  
<p>"Oh," said Pedro, "A miracle!" He then took up a rock and threw it at the rest of the chickens. "You see," he said, "I can perform miracles, too."</p>
