Plate 4, Figure 2  

FIGURE 2. Tsiukiri, father of the Kopishtaiya. Turkey feathers (gray
with white and black tips) as earrings and back of mask; parrot-feather
topknot (green and red); slanting line (red) represents the direction of
the southeast that Tsiukiri followed when sent away by Iatiku; the short
line joining it (red) is the straight East-West direction; the spots
(green, red, blue, orange, and white) are direction colors; the
background is black because the Kopishtaiya are night spirits; turkey
tracks (white) in the snow make it easier to track the turkeys, so are
lucky; fox-fur collar (gray); eyes and mouth outlined in red.
