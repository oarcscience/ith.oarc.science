##### DISILLUSION

Long ago how fine was everything!  
Fat mutton was all I ate,  
Coffee and sugar were all I ate,  
But now all I eat is the whip!

##### REGRET AND REFUSAL

*The boy speaks*  
All round about the door of your house  
The red and full blown flowers grow  
And there are striped ones of yellow  
And there are striped ones of white!  
About your door how gay it used to be,  
My little pony, even he had flowers,  
Alas, alas, and woe is me!

*The girl speaks*  
Once at my house how yellow, fresh  
And full blown was the flower you had!  
How green and fresh and full-blown  
Was the flower that once you had!

*The boy speaks*  
My woman also she has many flowers  
Yonder in Truchas, yonder in Seha.

*The girl speaks*  
So now he comes back to his sweetheart.  
So now you remember me and come back!  
Yes, yonder you thought again of your sweet-heart  
For they sang you a song of corn grinding,  
Those young men there, on Saturday afternoon!

*The boy speaks*  
Alone with myself and seeing you never  
What can I do, alas what will avail?  
Because you leave me now, you leave me,  
But ever when I think of you I weep.

*The girl speaks*  
My foolish one, you cannot hold me now:  
No more will I remember. It is done.
