<p><i>The boy speaks</i><br> All round about the door of your house<br> The red and full blown flowers grow<br> And there are striped ones of yellow<br> And there are striped ones of white!<br> About your door how gay it used to be,<br> My little pony, even he had flowers,<br> Alas, alas, and woe is me!</p>  
<p><i>The girl speaks</i><br> Once at my house how yellow, fresh<br> And full blown was the flower you had!<br> How green and fresh and full-blown<br> Was the flower that once you had!</p>  
<p><i>The boy speaks</i><br> My woman also she has many flowers<br> Yonder in Truchas, yonder in Seha.</p>  
<p><i>The girl speaks</i><br> So now he comes back to his sweetheart.<br> So now you remember me and come back!<br> Yes, yonder you thought again of your sweet-heart<br> For they sang you a song of corn grinding,<br> Those young men there, on Saturday afternoon!</p>  
<p><i>The boy speaks</i><br> Alone with myself and seeing you never<br> What can I do, alas what will avail?<br> Because you leave me now, you leave me,<br> But ever when I think of you I weep.</p>

<p><i>The girl speaks</i><br> My foolish one, you cannot hold me now:<br> No more will I remember. It is done.</p>
