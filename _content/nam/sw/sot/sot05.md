##### I

##### THE ROAD OF MAGIC

Yonder on White Mountain Plain  
It was good in the long ago!  
San Juan girls and San Juan boys,  
Together they used to walk  
Where lies the Road of Magic.

Yonder on Cactus Stalk Plain  
It was good in the long ago!  
Together we used to walk,  
San Juan girls and San Juan boys,  
Where lies the Road of Magic.

Yonder on Painted Mountain Plain  
It was good in the long ago!  
San Juan girls and San Juan boys,  
With them I used to walk  
Where lies the Road of Magic.

Here on Medicine Hill Plain  
Again we walk together!  
San Juan girls and San Juan boys,  
Again we walk together  
Where lies the Road of Magic!
