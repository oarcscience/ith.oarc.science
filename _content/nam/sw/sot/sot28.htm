<p>Here and now we bring you, oh our old men gods,<br> Sun Fire Deity and Blue Cloud Person of the North,<br> Sun Fire Deity and Yellow Cloud Person of the West,<br> Sun Fire Deity and Red Cloud Person of the South,<br> Sun Fire Deity and White Cloud Person of the East,<br> Sun Fire Deity and Dark Cloud Person of the Below,<br> Sun Fire Deity and All-colored Cloud Person of the Above,<br> Here-at we bring you now your special prayer stick,<br> We make for you an offering of sacred meal,<br> A little bit for all, we make these offerings to you!</p>  
<p>Stand ready, then, at dawn to walk<br> With rain upon the northward mountain top,<br> Upon the westward mountain top of the great lake dell,<br> Upon the southward mountain top where the Tshu people sit,<br> Upon the eastward mountain top of the great dawn,<br> Upon the mountain top that rests below the earth,<br> Upon the mountain top of the Sky Universe above!</p>  
<p>Bring cloud flowers that are not barren of rain,<br> Set them upon the far off northward mountain top,<br> Set them thereat upon the westward mountain top,<br> Set them thereat upon the southward mountain top,<br> Set them thereat upon the eastward mountain top,<br> Set them thereat upon the mountain top below the Earth,<br> Set them thereat upon the mountain top above the Sky,<br> Thereat set them, those cloud flowers not barren of rain!</p>

<p>There on the middle mountains first lay fogs.<br> That is why from there to San Juan town ready at dawn<br> You bring your lightnings, thunders and your rains together,<br> Transforming with magic the fields that in the middle are!<br> And that is why the stretched-out plain is now revived,<br> And that is why the hills of the plain are now revived,<br> And that is why your shrinking lakes, your lakes<br> Where they are lying, are now revived thereat!</p>  
<p>May all tame animals increase and children all,<br> For little people are we all to be loved of the Gods<br> As far away as our Great Mother's sound of breathing<br> Reaches. Even to the Utes, Apaches, Navajos,<br> Kiowas, Comanches, Cheyennes, even to all of them!<br> To the Mexican people, even to them it reaches!<br> To the people of America, even to them the sound<br> Of our Great Mother's breathing reaches. So now<br> They are loved of the Gods and each by the other loved!<br> So that is why we hope to find our living here,<br> We mortal men! Then place good summers and<br> Good days and nights of harvest! For each<br> The same, place then good days and nights of harvest!</p>
