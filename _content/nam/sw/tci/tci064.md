### THE LOCUST <span id="fr_131"></span>[7](#fn_130)

Somewhere in the southeast below there was a locust. She was singing.
Thither a Yellow Woman went down to some place where she was. There she
heard the locust singing somewhere. The Yellow Woman arrived there. Thus
she said to her, "Your song is pretty, please sing for me. I will pay
you four ears of green corn. I carry them on my back." The locust spoke
thus, "That is not enough. I have many children. They will not be
satisfied with this. They eat very much. Indeed, it is so." Then the
Yellow Woman spoke thus, "You sing, I will pay you still more. Your song
is pretty. It pleases me. Therefore I want you to sing. Over there below
in the field, much green corn is standing. Take it as payment for
yourself."

"All right," said the locust. Then she sang. It pleased her very much.
"Now I have sung for you," said she. "Thank you," said she. "Take your
children down." Early the locust and her children went together. Then
Yellow Woman became angry. Many locusts had gone into her field. They
ate all the green corn. Nothing was left. Yellow Woman also killed many.
