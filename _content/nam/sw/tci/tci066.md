### CACTUS LOVER <span id="fr_133"></span>[17](#fn_132)

A Navaho girl had no lover among her people. She went every day to the
mountains. The people said, "Where is it that she goes every day?" At
last one of the men followed her. He tracked her to the mountains, and
at last he came to the end of her foot prints. He hid himself near by.
There was something covered

up there. He heard talking. Pretty soon he heard an answer. They were
making love to each other. Finally the girl got up and uncovered
herself. She had been lying with her cactus lover (*yatapa*, a cactus).
The man who had followed her came back and told the people what he had
seen. That is why when we see yatapa, we call it "the Navaho girl's
lover."
