### THE WOMEN'S CORN GRINDING SOCIETY <span id="fr_33"></span>[5](#fn_32)

All the women of the Corn Grinding Society (Kuya') were to grind on that
day. They shelled all their baskets of corn and they put aside the
sooted ears. The head of the Corn Grinding Society called together all
the members of her society, and three women stayed in the house of the
head of the society and slept there in order to begin to grind before
sunrise. Daylight came and all the girls and women of the village
shelled baskets of corn to take with them to the Corn Grinding Society
to grind so that they might always have plenty. Everybody said, "Don't
put the sooted ears in with the good corn." The girls and women of that
village all went to grind and the head of the society and the three
women who had slept in her house were already grinding. They sang their
songs. One of the women heard somebody crying. She said, "Listen,
somebody is crying." Just then the door opened and Corn Soot Woman came
in crying. She said, "Nobody likes me to be with the corn they are to
grind. I am fat but nobody has any use for me." The head woman of the
society said to Corn Soot Woman, "Why are you crying?" "I am crying
because they don't ever put me among the

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

good ears. I am not rotten." The head woman of the society said, "Don't
ever separate her from the good corn. She is fat; that is why she is
what she is. She is the mother of the corn soot and you must put her in
with the good corn whenever you shell it, in order that that too may be
fat, as she is." They gave her a new name, Ioashkanake (shuck), and they
gave the soot a ceremonial name, Wesa. <span
