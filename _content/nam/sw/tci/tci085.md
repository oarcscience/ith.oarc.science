### ROAD RUNNER GIRLS GRIND <span id="fr_168"></span>[3a](#fn_167)

Road Runner girls were all grinding blue corn together. Each of them had
her grinding stone. They had ground great heaps of meal. \[paragraph

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

Coyote Woman came along and said, "Hello, girls, are you all grinding?"
"Yes, old Coyote." "Will you let me grind too? I'll go home and get my
grain." "Yes, go get it." She hurried home and came back as fast as
could be. While she was gone the girls made a plan. They said, "When she
comes back we'll make a high bank where we are grinding." Coyote Woman
came back. She had a great sifting basket full of acorns. She started to
grind. "Oh I can't break these acorns," she said. "What shall I grind?"
The Road Runner girls answered her, "Grind what you brought, Coyote."
"What shall I sing?" They gave her a song:

Coyote girls, Coyote girls,  
Grinding, grinding;  
Meal rolls down, down,  
He oo-- He oo.

The Road Runner girls started to excuse themselves. Coyote Woman kept on
grinding. Each one said, "We are going out." Three went out, one after
the other. When nobody came back for a long time Coyote Woman said too,
"I want to be excused." She went out from her grinding stone, and when
she stepped out of the door she fell over the high bank, and right there
she died.

Crow came, along and lit on top of old Coyote. She was trying to get her
eyes. Crow called out, "Animals, whoever uses fur for nests, come and
take his from old Coyote who has done mischief." So wood rats and mice
and chipmunks and squirrels came and took the fur from Coyote for their
nests. Crow said, "All the kinds of birds that eat meat, come and eat
Coyote, for she has done mischief." The eagle and the vulture and the
chicken hawk and hawk came, and they all ate her up. There was nothing
left but her bones.

Along came an old, old man with a carrying basket. He walked with a cane
and he could hardly get along. He wore fringed leggings. When he came to
the place where Coyote had died he saw the bones. He put them in his
basket and said, "These will make a nice soup for grandmother." He put
the basket on his back and took the bones home to his wife.
