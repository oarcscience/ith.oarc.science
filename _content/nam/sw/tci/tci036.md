### CORNCOB BOY INTERCEDES FOR HIS PEOPLE <span id="fr_74"></span>[21](#fn_73)

The people sinned and Heluta withheld the rains. Only to his son,
Corncob Boy, he gave stores for the four years of the drought. Corncob
Boy lived in a large house with his two wives, daughters of the cacique.
All kinds of corn were in his house and in the center was an
inexhaustible bowl of water. All of the summer birds lived with him in
his house during the time there was no rain. Heluta told him, "When the
people are dying of hunger and thirst and come to you for food, give it
to them; do not be stingy."

For four years the crops failed and the people were starving. They came
to Corncob Boy and said, "We are sorry for what we have done. Send
messengers to your father Heluta and ask him to forgive us." Corncob Boy
sent Coyote to take word to Heluta to ask him to forgive them: "Come
back and bring them good fortune." Heluta was sorry for the people and
he gave them the ceremony of the Giant Society. He brought it to
Cochiti. When it was over, Heluta said to the people, "Wait till I get
back to Shipap and you will have rain." When he had reached there, the
clouds came up with thunder and lightning. It began to rain and wet the
fields, and the people had water to drink.
