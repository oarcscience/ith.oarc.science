The head of the Corn Grinding Society called together all the members of her society, and three women stayed in the house of the head of the society and slept there in order to begin to grind before sunrise.

They gave her a new name, Ioashkanake (shuck), and they gave the soot a ceremonial name, Wesa.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A></P>
