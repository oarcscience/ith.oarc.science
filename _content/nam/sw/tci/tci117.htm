<P>There is a sacred place in the Navaho country where they go to make offerings to obtain domestic animals. If they have clean hearts and are thinking good thoughts toward all their people, a white horse will appear to them. So they get horses and sheep. They use some of the turquoise for themselves, but the most of it they use for these offerings.</P>
