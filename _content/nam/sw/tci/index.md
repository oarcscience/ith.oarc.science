This is a collection of texts from the Cochiti, a Native American Pueblo
tribe of New Mexico. Ruth Benedict gathered these texts in the early
1920s in the field with her mentor at Columbia University, Franz Boas.
The texts range from mythological to autobiographical, and give us an
unparalleled look at the inner life of a Native American group.

In her selection and commentary Benedict focuses on some interesting
points. In Pueblo culture, women are considered the equal of men, and
these tales show women exercising choice in their lives, engaging in
specialized occupations, and taking action when wronged. This is
reflected in Cochiti theology, which includes a cosmogenic mother (the
moon, here called 'Our Mother') and father (the Sun). The texts also
show the Pueblo as having positive attitudes about sexuality, (albeit
also placing high value on marriage and family). Benedict, refreshingly,
did not censor or translate into Latin the portions which previous
scholars would have considered too explicit. The texts also show the
darker side of traditional Southwestern life, where suspicion of malign
witchcraft could lead to dire consequences; and the incessant low-level
conflict with adjacent tribes, in this case, the Navajo.

Benedict was one of the first modern ethnographers. This collection is a
classic, and an enjoyable read as well.
