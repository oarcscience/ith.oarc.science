<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE STORY OF THE FLOOD</H1>
<P>NOW Seeurhuh was very powerful, like Juhwerta Mahkai, and as he took up his residence with them, as one of them, he did many wonderful things which pleased Juhwerta Mahkai, who liked to watch him.</P>
<P>And after doing many marvelous things he, too, made a man.</P>
<P>And to this man whom he had made, Seeurhuh (whose other name was Ee-ee-toy) gave a bow &amp; arrows, and guarded his arm against the bow string by a piece of wild-cat skin, and pierced his ears &amp; made ear-rings for him, like turquoises to look at, from the leaves of the weed called <I>quah-wool</I>. And this man was the most beautiful man yet made.</P>
<P>And Ee-ee-toy told this young man, who was just of marriageable age, to look around and see if he could find any young girl in the villages that would suit him and, if he found her, to see her relatives and see if they were willing he should marry her.</P>
<P>And the beautiful young man did this, and found a girl that pleased him, and told her family of his wish, and they accepted him, and he married her.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_37"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 37</FONT></A></P>
<P>And the names of both these are now forgotten and unknown.</P>
<P>And when they were married Ee-ee-toy, foreseeing what would happen, went &amp; gathered the gum of the greasewood tree.</P>
<P>Here the narrative states, with far too much plainness of circumstantial detail for popular reading, that this young man married a great many wives in rapid succession, abandoning the last one with each new one wedded, and had children with abnormal, even uncanny swiftness, for which the wives were blamed and for which suspicion they were thus heartlessly divorced. Because of this, Juhwerta Mahkai and Ee-ee-toy foresaw that nature would be convulsed and a great flood would come to cover the world. And then the narrative goes on to say:</P>
<P>Now there was a doctor who lived down toward the sunset whose name was Vahk-lohv Mahkai, or South Doctor, who had a beautiful daughter. And when his daughter heard of this young man and what had happened to his wives she was afraid and cried every day. And when her fattier saw her crying he asked her what was the matter? was she sick? And when she had told him what she was afraid of, for every one knew and was talking of this thing, he said yes, he knew it was true, but she ought not to be afraid, for there was happiness for a woman in marriage and the mothering of children.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_38"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 38</FONT></A></P>
<P>And it took many years for the young man to marry all these wives, and have all these children, and all this time Ee-ee-toy was busy making a great vessel of the gum he had gathered from the grease bushes, a sort of olla which could be closed up, which would keep back water. And while he was making this he talked over the reasons for it with Juhwerta Mahkai, Nooee, and Toehahvs, that it was because there was a great flood coming.</P>
<P>And several birds heard them talking thus--the woodpecker, <I>Hick-o-vick</I>; the humming-bird, <I>Vee-pis-mahl</I>; a little bird named <I>Gee-ee-sop</I>, and another called <I>Quota-veech</I>.</P>
<P>Eeeetoy said he would escape the flood by getting into the vessel he was making from the gum of the grease bushes or <I>ser-quoy</I>.</P>
<P>And Juhwerta Mahkai said he would get into his staff, or walking stick, and float about.</P>
<P>And Toehahvs said he would get into a cane-tube.</P>
<P>And the little birds said the water would not reach the sky, so they would fly up there and hang on by their bills till it was over.</P>
<P>And Nooee, the buzzard, the powerful, said he did not care if the flood did reach the sky, for he could find a way to break thru.</P>
<P>Now Ee-ee-toy was envious, and anxious to get ahead of Juhwerta Mahkai and get more fame for his wonderful deeds, but Juhwerta Mahkai, though really the strongest, was generous and from</P>
<P><A NAME="page_39"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 39</FONT></A></P>
<P>kindness and for relationship sake let Ee-ee-toy have the best of it.</P>
<P>And the young girl, the doctor's daughter, kept on crying, fearing the young man, feeling him ever coming nearer, and her father kept on reassuring her, telling her it would be all right, but at last, out of pity for her fears &amp; tears, he told her to go and get him the little tuft of the finest thorns on the top of the white cactus, the <I>haht-sahn-kahm</I>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1"></A><A HREF="#fn_1"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and bring to him.</P>
<P>And her father took the cactus-tuft which she had brought him, and took hair from her head and wound about one end of it, and told her if she would wear this it would protect her. And she consented and wore the cactus-tuft.</P>
<P>And he told her to treat the young man right, when he came, &amp; make him broth of corn. And if the young man should eat all the broth, then their plan would fail, but if he left any broth she was to eat that up and then their plan would succeed.</P>
<P>And he told her to be sure and have a bow and arrows above the door of the <I>kee</I>, so that he could take care of the young man.</P>
<P>And after her father had told her this, on that</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_40"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 40</FONT></A></P>
<P>very evening the young man came, and the girl received him kindly, and took his bows &amp; arrows, and put them over the door of the kee, as her father had told her, and made the young man broth of corn and gave it to him to eat.</P>
<P>And he ate only part of it and what was left she ate herself.</P>
<P>And before this her father had told her: "if the young man is wounded by the thorns you wear, in that moment he will become a woman and a mother and you will become a young man."</P>
<P>And in the night all this came to be, even so, and by day-break the child was crying.</P>
<P>And the old woman ran in and said: "<I>Mossay</I>!" which means an old woman's grandchild from a daughter.</P>
<P>And the daughter, that had been, said: "It is not your <I>moss</I>, it is your <I>cah-um-maht</I>," that is an old woman's grandchild from a son.</P>
<P>And then the old man ran in and said: "<I>Bah-ahm-ah-dah</I>!" that is an old man's grandchild from a daughter, but his daughter said: "It is not your <I>bah-ahm-maht</I>, but it is your <I>voss-ahm-maht</I>," which is an old man's grandchild from a son.</P>
<P>And early in the morning this young man (that had been, but who was now a woman &amp; a mother) made a <I>wawl-kote</I>, a carrier, or cradle, for the baby and took the trail back home.</P>
<P>And Juhwerta Mahkai told his neighbors of what was coming, this young man who had changed</P>
<P><A NAME="page_41"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 41</FONT></A></P>
<P>into a woman and a mother and was bringing a baby born from himself, and that when he arrived wonderful things would happen &amp; springs would gush forth from under every tree and on every mountain.</P>
<P>And the young man-woman came back and by the time of his return Ee-ee-toy had finished his vessel and had placed therein seeds &amp; everything that is in the world.</P>
<P>And the young man-woman, when he came to his old home, placed his baby in the bushes and left it, going in without it, but Ee-ee-toy turned around and looked at him and knew him, for he did not wear a woman's dress, and said to him: "Where is my Bahahmmaht? Bring it to me. I want to see it. It is a joy for an old man to see his grandchild.</P>
<P>I have sat here in my house and watched your going, and all that has happened you, and foreseen some one would send you back in shame, although I did not like to think there was anyone more powerful than I. But never mind, he who has beaten us will see what will happen."</P>
<P>And when the young man-woman went to get his baby, Ee-ee-toy got into his vessel, and built a fire on the hearth he had placed therein, and sealed it up.</P>
<P>And the young man-woman found his baby crying, and the tears from it were all over the ground, around. And when he stooped over to pick up his child he turned into a sand-snipe,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_42"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 42</FONT></A></P>
<P>and the baby turned into a little teeter-snipe. And then that came true which Juhwerta Mahkai had said, that water would gush out from under every tree &amp; on every mountain; and the people when they saw it, and knew that a flood was coming, ram to Juhwerta Mahkai; and he took his staff and made a hole in the earth and let all those thru who had come to him, but the rest were drowned.</P>
<P>Then Juhwerta Mahkai got into his walking stick &amp; floated, and Toehahvs got into his tube of cane and floated, but Ee-ee-toy's vessel was heavy &amp; big and remained until the flood was much deeper before it could float.</P>
<P>And the people who were left out fled to the mountains; to the mountains called <I>Gah-kote-ki</I>h (Superstition Mts.) for they were living in the plains between Gahkotekih and Cheoffskawmack (Tall Gray Mountain.)</P>
<P>And there was a powerful man among these people, a doctor (mahkai), who set a mark on the mountain side and said the water would not rise above it.</P>
<P>And the people believed him and camped just beyond the mark; but the water came on and they had to go higher. And this happened four times.</P>
<P>And the mahkai did this to help his people, and also used power to raise the mountain, but at last he saw all was to be a failure. And he called the people and asked them all to come</P>
<P><A NAME="page_43"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 43</FONT></A></P>
<P>close together, and he took his doctor-stone (<I>mahkai-haw-teh</I>) which is called Tonedumhawteh or Stone-of-Light, and held it in the palm of his hand and struck it hard with his other hand, and it thundered so loud that all the people were frightened and they were all turned into stone.</P>
<P>And the little birds, the woodpecker, Hickovick; the humming-bird, Veepismahl; the little bird named Ge-ee-sop, and the other called Quotaveech, all flew up to the sky and hung on by their bills, but Nooee still floated in the air and intended to keep on the wing unless the floods reached the heavens.</P>
<P>But Juhwerta Mahkai, Ee-ee-toy and Toehahvs floated around on the water and drifted to the west and did not know where they were.</P>
<P>And the flood rose higher until it reached the woodpecker's tail, and you can see the marks to this day.</P>
<P>And Quotaveech was cold and cried so loud that the other birds pulled off their feathers and built him a nest up there so he could keep warm. And when Quotaveech was warm he quit crying.</P>
<P>And then the little birds sang, for they had power to make the water go down by singing, and as they sang the waters gradually <A HREF="errata.htm#5">receded</A>.</P>
<P>But the others still floated around.</P>
<P>When the land began to appear Juhwerta Mahkai and Toehahvs got out, but Ee-ee-toy had to wait for his house to warm up, for he had built a fire to warm his vessel enough for him to unseal it.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_44"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 44</FONT></A></P>
<P>When it was warm enough he unsealed it, but when he looked out he saw the water still running &amp; he got back and sealed himself in again.</P>
<P>And after waiting a while he unsealed his vessel again, and seeing dry land enough he got out.</P>
<P>And Juhwerta Mahkai went south and Toehahvs went west, and Ee-ee-toy went northward. And as they did not know where they were they missed each other, and passed each other unseen, but afterward saw each other's tracks, and then turned back and shouted, but wandered from the track, and again passed unseen. And this happened four times.</P>
<P>And the fourth time Juhwerta Mahkai and Ee-ee-toy met, but Toehahvs had passed already.</P>
<P>And when they met, Ee-ee-toy said to Juhwerta Mahkai "My younger brother!" but Juhwerta Mahkai greeted him as younger brother &amp; claimed to have come out first. Then Ee-ee-toy said again: "I came out first and you can see the water marks on my body." But Juhwerta Mahkai replied: "I came out first and also have the water marks on my person to prove it."</P>
<P>But Ee-ee-toy so insisted that he was the eldest that Juhwerta Mahkai, just to please him, gave him his way and let him be considered the elder.</P>
<P>And then they turned westward and yelled to find Toehahvs, for they remembered to have seen his tracks, and they kept on yelling till he heard them. And when Toehahvs saw them he called them his younger brothers, and they called</P>
<P><A NAME="page_45"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 45</FONT></A></P>
<P>him younger brother. And this dispute continued till Ee-ee-toy again got the best of it, and although really the younger brother was admitted by <A HREF="errata.htm#6">the</A> others to be Seeurhuh, or the elder.</P>
<P>And the birds came down from the sky and again there was a dispute about the relationship, but Ee-ee-toy again got the best of them all.</P>
<P>But Quotaveech staid up in the sky because he had a comfortable nest there, and they called him <I>Vee-ick-koss-kum Mahkai</I>, the Feather-Nest Doctor.</P>
<P>And they wanted to find the middle, the navel of the earth, and they sent Veeppismahl, the humming bird, to the west, and Hickovick, the woodpecker, to the east, and all the others stood and waited for them at the starting place. And Veepismahl &amp; Hickovick were to go as far as they could, to the edge of the world, and then return to find the middle of the earth by their meeting. But Hickovick flew a little faster and got there first, and so when they met they found it was not the middle, and they parted &amp; started again, but this time they changed places and Hickovick went westward and Veepismahl went east.</P>
<P>And this time Veepismahl was the faster, and Hickovick was late, and the judges thought their place of meeting was a little east of the center so they all went a little way west. Ee-ee-toy, Juhwerta Mahkai and Toehahvs stood there and sent the birds out once more, and this time Hickovick went eastward again, and Veepismahl went west.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_46"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 46</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> And Hickovick flew faster and arrived there first. And they said : "This is not the middle. It is a little way west yet."</P>
<P>And so they moved a little way, and again the birds were sent forth, and this time Hickovick went west and Veepismahl went east. And when the birds returned they met where the others stood and all cried "This is the <I>Hick</I>, the Navel of the World!"</P>
<P>And they stood there because there was no dry place yet for them to sit down upon; and Ee-eetoy rubbed upon his breast and took from his bosom the smallest ants, the <I>O-auf-taw-ton</I>, and threw them upon the ground, and they worked there and threw up little hills; and this earth was dry. And so they sat down.</P>
<P>But the: water was still running in the valleys, and Ee-ee-toy took a hair from his head &amp; made it into a snake--<I>Vuck-vahmuht</I>. And with this snake he pushed the waters south, but the head of the snake was left lying to the west and his tail to the east.</P>
<P>But there was more water, and Ee-ee-toy took another hair from his head and made another snake, and with this snake pushed the rest of the water north. And the head of this snake was left to the east and his tail to the west. So the head of each snake was left lying with the tail of the other.</P>
<P>And the snake that has his tail to the east, in the morning will shake up his tail to start the</P>
<P><A NAME="page_47"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 47</FONT></A></P>
<P>morning wind to wake the people and tell them to think of their dreams.</P>
<P>And the snake that has his tail to the west, in the evening will shake up his tail to start the cool wind to tell the people it is time to go in and make the fires &amp; be comfortable.</P>
<P>And they said: "We will make dolls, but we will not let each other see them until they are finished."</P>
<P>And Ee-ee-toy sat facing the west, and Toehahvs facing the south, and Juhwerta Mahkai facing the east.</P>
<P>And the earth was still damp and they took clay and began to make dolls. And Ee-ee-toy made the best. But Juhwerta Mahkai did not make good ones, because he remembered some of his people had escaped the flood thru a hole in the earth, and he intended to visit them and he did not want to make anything better than they were to take the place of them. And Toehahvs made the poorest of all.</P>
<P>Then Ee-ee-toy asked them if they were ready, and they all said yes, and then they turned about and showed each other the dolls they had made.</P>
<P>And Ee-ee-toy asked Juhwerta Mahkai why he had made such queer dolls. "This one," he said, "is not right, for you have made him without any sitting-down parts, and how can he get rid of the waste of what he eats?"</P>
<P>But Juhwerta Mahkai said: "He will not need to eat, he can just smell the smell of what is cooked."</P>
<P><A NAME="page_48"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 48</FONT></A></P>
<P>Then Ee-ee-toy asked again: "Why did you make this doll with only one leg--how can he run?" But Juhwerta Mahkai replied: "He will not need to run; he can just hop around."</P>
<P>Then Ee-ee-toy asked Toehahvs why he had made a doll with webs between his fingers and toes--"How can he point directions?" But Toehahvs said he had made these dolls so for good purpose, for if anybody gave them small seeds they would not slip between their fingers, and they could use the webs for dippers to drink with.</P>
<P>And Ee-ee-toy held up his dolls and said: "These are the best of all, and I want you to make more like them." And he took Toehahv's dolls and threw them into the water and they became ducks &amp; beavers. And he took Juhwerta Mahkai's dolls and threw them away and they all broke to pieces and were nothing.</P>
<P>And Juhwerta Mahkai was angry at this and began to sink into the ground; and took his stick and hooked it into the sky and pulled the sky down while he was sinking. But Ee-ee-toy spread his hand over his dolls, and held up the sky, and seeing that Juhwerta Mahkai was sinking into the earth he sprang and tried to hold him &amp; cried, "Man, what are you doing? Are you going to leave me and my people here alone?"</P>
<P>But Juhwerta Mahkai slipped through his hands, leaving in them only the waste &amp; excretion of his skin. And that is how there is sickness &amp; death among us.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_49"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 49</FONT></A></P>
<P>And Ee-ee-toy, when Juhwerta Mahkai escaped him, went around swinging his hands &amp; saying: "I never thought all this impurity would come upon my people!" and the swinging of his hands scattered disease over all the earth. And he washed himself in a pool or pond and the impurities remaining in the water are the source of the malarias and all the diseases of dampness.</P>
<P>And Ee-ee-toy and Toehahvs built a house for their dolls a little way off, and Ee-ee-toy sent Toehahvs to listen if they were yet talking. And the <I>Aw-up</I>, (the Apaches) were the first ones that talked. And Ee-ee-toy said: "I never meant to have those Apaches talk first, I would rather have had the <I>Aw-aw-tam</I>, the Good People, speak first. "</P>
<P>But he said: "It is all right. I will give them strength, that they stand the cold &amp; all hardships." And all the different people that they had made talked, one after the other, but the Awawtam talked last.</P>
<P>And they all took to playing together, and in their play they kicked each other as the Maricopas do in sport to this day; but the Apaches got angry and said: "We will leave you and go into the mountains and eat what we can get, but we will dream good dreams and be just as happy as you with all your good things to eat."</P>
<P>And some of the people took up their residence on the Gila, and some went west to the Rio Colorado. And those who builded vahahkkees,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_50"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 50</FONT></A></P>
<P>or houses out of adobe and stones, lived in the valley of the Gila, between the mountains which are there now.</P>
