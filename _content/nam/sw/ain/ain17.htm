<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">NOTES ON THE STORY OF WAYHOHM</H3>
<P>There is a suggestion of Thor in the Story of Wayhohm, and also of Prometheus. Wayhohm's house must have been the hall of the clouds.</P>
<P>How true to nature, here, is the touch describing the Coyote-person, Toehahvs. The <A HREF="errata.htm#12">excessive</A> caution of the coyote, making it impossible for him, however eager, to force himself into any position be suspects, here stands out before us, contrasted in the most dramatic way with the dashing boldness of the road-runner.</P>
<P>When we reached the end of this story Comalk Hawk-Kih took two pieces of wood to rub them together to make fire. But he was old and breathless, and "Sparkling-Soft-Feather," the mother of my interpreter, took them and made the fire for me. I have the implements yet.</P>
<P>There were two parts to the apparatus. Gee-uh-toe-dah, the socket stick was of a soft dry piece of giant cactus rib, and a notch was whittled in one side of this with a small socket at the apex, that is on the upper side.</P>
<P>This was placed flat on the ground, with a bit of corn husk under the notch, and held firmly in position by the bare feet. The twirling stick, eev-a-dah-kote, was a hard arrow weed, very dry and scraped smooth. The end of this was engaged in the little socket, at the top of the cactus rib, and then, held perpendicularly, was twirled between the two bands till the friction rubbed off a powder which crowded out of the socket, and fell down the notch at its side to the corn-husk. This little increasing pile of powder was the tinder, and, as the twirling continued, grew black, smelled like burned wood, smoked and finally glowed like punk. It was now picked up on the corn husk and placed in dry horse dung, a bunch of dry grass, or some such inflammable material, and blown into flame.</P>
<P>It looked very simple, and took little time, but I never could do it.</P>
