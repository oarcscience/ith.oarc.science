### NOTES ON THE STORY OF SOHAHNEE MAHKAI

In this we are given a most graphic and pathetic glimpse of Indian
warfare.

Notice the bushes are "cut down" (broken off more likely) by a stick. A
glimpse of the rude old tools.

Very poetic is the conception of Veeipschool, "the being above who is
always sad, and makes people sad when anything bad has happened." A
personification of premonition.
