### NOTES ON THE STORY OF PAHTAHNKUM

In this, in the smoking at the war-council, appears a curious
superstition concerning the effect of a man's smoking upon his unborn
child.

Another superstition appears in the idea that the killing of an Apache
and throwing up of his [accoutrements](errata.htm#28) or scalp would
cause rain.

I have a boy's bow and arrows just like those described in this story,
bought of a Pima child.

War arrows were a yard long, with three feathers instead of two, and
tipped with flint or, later, with iron. But even a wooden arrow would
kill a deer.

Bows were made from Osage orange, cat-claw, or *o a-pot*; or, better
still, from a tree called *gaw-hee*. Arrows from arrow-weeds. The Apache
arrows were made of cane.

The Pimas were formerly famous for archery, and the shooting of bird on
the wing, and of jack rabbits at full run while the archer was pursuing
on horseback, were favorite feats.

The Apache well: I am told the old Arizona Indian wells were not walled
up, and the sides were at such a slant that the women could walk down to
the water and back with their ollas on their heads.

Wells are now obtained without great difficulty, but the water is salty
and often alkaline and none too cool.
