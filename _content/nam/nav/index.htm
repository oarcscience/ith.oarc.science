<P>
The Navajo, who call themselves <I>Din&eacute;</I>
("The People") are the largest Native American group in North America.
Their tales of emergence and migration are similar to other Southwestern
tribes such as the Hopi (with whom they have a long running rivalry).
Navajo ceremonies such as the Nightway and the Mountain Chant
are renowned for their beautiful liturgy.
