### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_129">p. 129</span>

<span id="page_129_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_129_fr_*) The
Ethkay-nah-ashi, literally “The two who go about together,” are
mentioned in the Creation story, [p. 41](ncm4.htm#page_41). The
offerings are meant to be given to “The young man who walks in the
darkness” and “The young woman of the dusk.” This is the very first song
of the Creation story as given by the singer Klah. Five songs with the
same melody and text follow except that the refrain—May it be made as
offering to him—is changed to:  
 They have started off with it (the offering).  
 They have taken (the offerings) away (for the dead).  
 They have set (the offerings) down (for the dead).  
 He picks (the offerings) up.  
 He is pleased (with the offering).

 Sandpainting No. 4, Series I, shows the Ethkay-nah-ashi.

<span id="footnotes_page_131">p. 131</span>

<span id="page_131_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_131_fr_*) The Flood is
expressed in Navajo by the phrase, “we are running from the waters.” The
Navajo words in the last two lines are esoteric expressions which are
used only in songs and prarers. Their meaning is sacred and medicine-men
disagree on their exact interpretation. The second word contains the
Navajo word for “holy.”

<span id="footnotes_page_135">p. 135</span>

<span id="page_135_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_135_fr_*) Over the earth.

<span id="page_135_note_**"></span>[\*\*](#page_135_fr_**) “The various
robes” include skins and possessions of soft materials which the Navajo
contrast with “hard” possessions such as jewelry, translated with
“precious things” here. Two songs with the same melody and text follow.
The first changes the refrain—*Smoke was spreading* (*over the
earth*)—to: *Smoke streamed out* (*from behind them*). The second
changes the refrain to: *He* (*First Man*) *commanded them, they heard
them*, except the last line of each stanza where it has instead: *He on
the chief mountain commanded them, they heard him*.

<span id="footnotes_page_137">p. 137</span>

<span id="page_137_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_137_fr_*) “Water pollen”
refers to the detritus carried by a stream and deposited in black
streaks along the sides of the banks.

<span id="footnotes_page_140">p. 140</span>

<span id="page_140_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_140_fr_*) “The little
darkness” is a poetic reference to the sweathouse; “the little daylight”
to the entrance of the sweathouse.

<span id="footnotes_page_142">p. 142</span>

<span id="page_142_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_142_fr_*) 1. After each of
the following first lines, the last six lines of the first stanza are
repeated, substituting “Sky, mountains,” etc. for “Earth.”

 The word *hozhoni* (meaning peace or beauty) indicates the perfect
rhythm betwern man and the universe.—M. C. W.

<span id="footnotes_page_144">p. 144</span>

<span id="page_144_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_144_fr_*) That is, the
creator is planning the creation of the sun.

<span id="footnotes_page_145">p. 145</span>

<span id="page_145_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_145_fr_*) Three songs with
the same melody and text follow, except that they substitute for the
refrain: *They say he is planning it*, the following: *They say he is
talking about it; They say he has made it*.

<span id="footnotes_page_146">p. 146</span>

<span id="page_146_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_146_fr_*) A poetic
reference to the sun or moon.

<span id="footnotes_page_148">p. 148</span>

<span id="page_148_note_1"></span>[1](#page_148_fr_1) A constellation
said to be near the Pleiades; literally: “The first one which is
narrow.”

<span id="page_148_note_2"></span>[2](#page_148_fr_2) Unidentified,
literally: “The old man with his legs apart.”

<span id="page_148_note_3"></span>[3](#page_148_fr_3) Unidentified,
literally: “The cane of the first big one.”

<span id="page_148_note_4"></span>[4](#page_148_fr_4) Another
constellation.

<span id="footnotes_page_149">p. 149</span>

<span id="page_149_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_149_fr_*) A song with the
same melody and text follows, except that the refrain: *Man will be
created* is replaced by: *Man has increased* (*in numbers*).

<span id="footnotes_page_150">p. 150</span>

<span id="page_150_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_150_fr_*) The Navajo word
translated here as “hush” is an interjection used by mothers to quiet
crying babies.

<span id="footnotes_page_153">p. 153</span>

<span id="page_153_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_153_fr_*) Two songs with
the same melody and text follow, except that they substitute “abalone”
and “jet” for “white shell” and “turquoise.” Then come five groups of
four songs each, substituting for the refrain “She moves”: *She stands
up, She stands, She dances, She jingles*, and: (*Her ornaments*) *crowd
up on her again and again*. In all other details, they are identical
with the first group of four songs.

<span id="footnotes_page_154">p. 154</span>

<span id="page_154_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_154_fr_*) This song is
about the journey of the two War-Gods to their father, the Sun, see [p.
79](ncm4.htm#page_79) of the story. The odd divisions of the poem
attempt to follow the musical treatment in the song, according to which
the second and third repetition of the refrain-formula are joined
together in the introduction. What would be the third line of the brief
stanzas is joined to the refrain-sections that form the connective and
the coda. Two songs with the same melody and text follow, except that
they change *they are coming* in the refrain to: *They two are coming*,
and: *Several of them are coming*.

<span id="footnotes_page_155">p. 155</span>

<span id="page_155_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_155_fr_*) The singer
commented: “On top of the Earth, below the Sky, below the Sun, among the
small waters, old age goes around.”

<span id="footnotes_page_156">p. 156</span>

<span id="page_156_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_156_fr_*) Three songs with
the same melody and text follow, substituting for the refrain: *He
places it around me*, *It is beautiful on me*, and: *I have passed
through it* (i.e., the ring formed by the rainbow).

<span id="footnotes_page_158">p. 158</span>

<span id="page_158_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_158_fr_*) Three songs with
the identical melody and text follow, except that they substitute for
the refrain, *He is thinking about it*; *He is talking to them about
it*, *They are placing them* (i.e., the main beams of the hogahn), and:
*They laid them down*. Also, in the last song the phrase “will be main
beams” is everywhere replaced by: “they are placing them”.

<span id="footnotes_page_159">p. 159</span>

<span id="page_159_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_159_fr_*) This song is sung
by Changing-Woman when her two children visit her on her island, see [p.
122](ncm4.htm#page_122) of the story. The singer stated that the song
was sung when the patient steps into the footstep marks on the
sandpainting, before he is made to sit down on it.

<span id="footnotes_page_161">p. 161</span>

<span id="page_161_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_161_fr_*) The second to the
ninth lines of the stanza are repeated to make a full stanza after each
of the following introductory lines.
