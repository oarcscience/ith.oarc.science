<P><SMALL><B>NOTE:</B> The printed version of this book is in a very basic typescript with all of the diacritical marks and IPA symbols added by hand. This resulted in some symbols that were nearly illegible. As I am not fluent in Navajo orthography, especially the more complicated premodern systems, some of the transcriptions may be slightly wrong. Also, there was a page of errata which has been silently incorporated into this version along with a few other minor typographical corrections.</SMALL></P>
