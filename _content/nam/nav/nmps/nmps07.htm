<P>B&eacute;kot<I>s</I>&iuml;di and Sun Bearer (T<I>s</I>&iacute;<I>n</I>ihanoai) made all the animals while they were sitting together in the same room,-- B&eacute;kot<I>s</I>&iuml;di in the north, T<I>s</I>&iacute;<I>n</I>ihanoai in the south. While the former was making a horse, the latter was making an antelope, and this is why the antelope is so much like a horse. It has a mane and no small back toes as the deer has.</P>
<P>Both of the gods sang while they were at work, and this was the song that B&eacute;kot<I>s</I>&iuml;di sang to bless all that he was making. It was the first song which he sang at this work.</P>
<P>1. Now B&eacute;kots&iuml;di, that am I. For them I make.<BR>
2. Now child of Day Bearer am I. For them I make.<BR>
3. Now Day Bearer's beam of blue. For them I make.<BR>
4. Shines on my feet and your feet too. For them I make.<BR>
5. Horses of all kinds now increase. For them I make.<BR>
6. At my finger's tips and yours. For them I make.<BR>
7. Beasts of all kinds now increase. For them I make.<BR>
S. The bluebirds now increase. For them I make.<BR>
9. Soft goods of all kinds now increase. For them I make.<BR>
10. Now with the pollen they increase. For them I make.<BR>
11. Increasing now, they will last forever. For them I make.<BR>
12. In old age wandering on the trail of beauty. For them I make.<BR>
13. To form them fair, for them I labor. For them I make.</P>

<P>After he had made the animals, he sang another song the refrain of which is "Ka<I>t</I> <I>h</I>ad<I>z</I>&iacute;<I>d</I>ila`, now they are made." As the animals began to breed, he sang another song appropriate to this, and when they were multiplying abundantly, he sang a fourth song, the burden of which was Kean&aacute;dild<I>z</I>&iuml;<I>s</I>i, which means, they are multiplying.</P>
<P>While Day Bearer was making the horse and domestic sheep, B&eacute;kot<I>s</I>&iuml;di was making antelope and bighorn. While Day Bearer was making a goat, B&eacute;kot<I>s</I>&iuml;di was making a cow. While the former was making a deer, the latter was making an elk. Then Day Bearer began to make a mule and Bekotsidi began to make a donkey, and the former said: "I shall stop with this; I shall make no more." But B&eacute;kot<I>s</I>&iuml;di said, "I shall continue my work." Then he made the jack-rabbit, the small rabbit, the prairie-dog, the wood-rat, and many more animals.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_26"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A></P>
<P>No pictures were drawn of Bekotsidi and no one masquerades in his form. His appearance is not known.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_27"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A></P>
<P>Four songs and no more belong to this tale. If you want a fine horse, sing the second and third songs, say a prayer, and you will get the horse. In your prayer specify the color and kind of a horse you desire., It will come to you from the house of Day Bearer.</P>
<P>The name B&eacute;kot<I>s</I>&iuml;di signifies "He tries to catch it." He got his name while he was out hunting. An indecent story is told to account for this.</P>
<P>The first iron-gray horse was made of turquoise, the first red (sorrel) horse of red stone (carnelian ?), the first black horse of cannel coal, the first white horse of white shell, and the first piebald horse of haliotis shell. So horses are now, according to their color, called after the different substances of which the first horses were made, Thus the Navahoes speak of do<I>l</I>&iuml;'<I>z</I>i <I>l</I>i<I>n</I>. (turquoise or gray horse), b&aacute;st<I>s</I>&iuml;li <I>l</I>i<I>n</I> (red stone or sorrel hors e), b&aacute;sz&iuml;ni <I>l</I>i<I>n</I> (cannel coal or black horse), yo<I>l</I>ka&iacute; <I>l</I>i<I>n</I> (haliotis or spotted horse).</P>
<P>The hoofs of the first horse were made of tse`<I>h</I>ad&aacute;<I>h</I>onige, or mirage stone, a stone on which paints are ground. Such stones</P>
<P><A NAME="page_60"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 60</FONT></A></P>
<P>are added to earth from six sacred mountains to form their most potent medicine. A shaman will not treat a diseased horse without this. It is used, too, when they pray for increase of stock and increase of wealth.</P>
