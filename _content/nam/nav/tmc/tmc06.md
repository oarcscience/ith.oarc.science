# ORIGINAL TEXTS AND TRANSLATIONS OF SONGS, &C.

192\. The songs of the dsilyídje qaçàl are very numerous and their
recitation is governed by many rules, a few of which only have been
discovered by the writer.

193\. A list has been recorded of thirteen sets of songs which may
properly be sung at night in the medicine lodge, When the ceremonies of
the day are done, and in the corral on the last night, when there is no
special song in progress pertaining to a particular alili or dance.

The list which follows exhibits the order in which these songs may be
sung on any particular night. For example, if the singers begin with a
song from set III, they cannot follow immediately with a song from sets
I or II, but must select from some of the following sets, as set IV or
V. Again, in each set the songs have a certain order of sequence which
must not be reversed. For convenience these will be called

194\. Besides those referred to in the above list, there are more which
are appropriate to different acts in the ceremony, such as the songs
sung at the obliteration of the pictures, at the building of the corral,
at the departure of the akáninili, &e.

195\. In some cases a number of songs in the same set are nearly alike;
the addition or substitution of one verse, or even of one word, may be
the only difference. Such songs usually follow one another in immediate
succession; often, on the other hand, we find a great variety in subject
and in style.

196\. Some songs are self-explanatory or readily understood, but the
greater number cannot be comprehended without a full knowledge of the
mythology and of the symbolism to which they refer; they merely hint at
mythic conceptions. Many contain archaic expressions, for which the
shaman can assign a meaning, but whose etymology cannot now be learned;
and some embody obsolete words whose meaning is lost even to the
priesthood. There are many vocables known to be meaningless and recited
merely to fill out the rhythm or to give a dignified length to the song.
For the same reasons a meaningless syllable is often added or a
significant syllable duplicated.

197\. Other poetical licenses are taken, such as the omission of a
syllable, the change of accent, the substitution of one vowel for
another. The most familiar words are often distorted beyond recognition.
For these various reasons the task of noting and translating these songs
is one of considerable difficulty.

198\. FIRST SONG OF THE FIRST DANCERS.

Qaniè qaò yaè, qaniè qaò yaè  
Qaniè iè oayè oayè.

1\. Qadjinäìa qaò yaè,  
2. Kaç dsil ¢ilhyíli qaò yaè,  
3. \`Çaltsoï tsèë qaò yaè,  
4. Cija cigèlgo qaò yaè.  
    Náhi ìni èhi oayè, náhi ìni èhi oöhè.

    Náhi ìni, etc.

13\. Niqoyastcàdje qaò yaè,

15. A\`a\`i tsèe qaò yaè,  
16. Cija cigèlgo qaò yaè.  
    Náhi ìni, etc.

199\. *Translation*.--1, 9. Qadjinàï, "Place-where-they-came-up," a
locality in the San Juan Mountains where, according to their mythology,
the Navajo emerged from the lower world to this. 5, 13. Niqoyastcàdje,
another name for Qadjinàï. 2, 6, 10, 14. Kaç, now; dsil, mountain;
¢ilhyíli, black; çolíji, blue; litsòï, yellow; lakàie, white. These
verses refer to four mountains surrounding Qadjinàï, which are
designated by colors only to indicate their topographical positions. 3,
7, 11, 15. \`Çalsoï = aça litsòï, "yellow wing," a large bird of prey;
kini, hen hawk; bitselitsòï, "yellow tail," a bird of undetermined
species; a\`a\`i, magpie; tse, a tall; bitse, its tail. 4, 8, 12, 16.
Cija, my treasure; cigèl, my desideratum, my ultimatum, the only thing I

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

will accept. When supposed to be said by a god, as in this song, it
means the particular sacrifice which is appropriate to him. In this case
probably the feathers spoken of are "cigèl" and the mountains "cija."
The refrain "qaò yaè" is a poetic modification of qaa\`, it looms up, or
sticks up, said of some lofty object visible in the distance, whose base
cannot be seen.

200\. *Free translation*.

Place-whence-they-came-up looms up,  
Now the black mountain looms up,  
The tail of the " yellow wing" looms up,  
My treasure, my sacrifice, loom up.

Laud-where-they-moved-out looms up,  
Now the blue mountain looms up,  
The tail of the hen-hawk looms up,  
My treasure, my sacrifice, loom up.

Place-whence-they-came-up looms up,  
Now the yellow mountain looms up,  
The tail that is yellow looms up,  
My treasure, my sacrifice, loom up.

Land-where-they-moved-out looms up,  
Now the white mountain looms up,  
The tail of the magpie looms up,  
My treasure, my sacrifice, loom up.

201\. FIRST SONG OF THE MOUNTAIN SHEEP.

1\. Yiki ¢asizìni,  
2. Kaç Tsilkè-¢igìni,

2, 6. Kaç, now, tsilkè; young man; tcikè, young woman; ¢igìni, holy. 3.
Kátso-yisçàn, the great plumed arrow; kátsoye yisçàn, with the great
plumed arrow. 4, 9. Tsí¢a, truly, verily; baälìli, an alili, a show, a
rite, or implement used in a dance for him. 5, 10. Bíja, his treasure,
his special property, his peculiar belonging; ye, with, a prefix forming
nouns which denote the means; ¢igíngo, positively holy or supernatural.
Bíja-ye¢igíngo might be translated "charm" or "talisman."

He stands high upon it;  
Now the Holy young Man \[Young Woman, in Second stanza\],  
With the great plumed arrow,  
Verily his own sacred implement,  
His treasure, by virtue of which he is truly holy.

204\. A reference to the myth and the description of the ceremonies will
probably be sufficient to give the reader an understanding of this song.
This set of songs, it is said, was first sung by the black sheep which
stood on the rock as a sign to the Navajo fugitive; hence the name. (See
paragraphs 35, 47, 48, 54.)

205\. SIXTH SONG OF THE MOUNTAIN SHEEP.

Verily his own sacred implement,  
His treasure which makes him holy,  
Is encircled.

Now the Holy Young Woman,  
With the rainbow,  
Verily her own sacred implement,  
Her treasure which makes her holy,  
Is encircled.

208\. Which is to say that the great plumed arrows which they bear are
adorned with sunbeams and rainbows. They "shine in glory." (See
references in paragraph 204.)

209\. TWELFTH SONG OF THE MOUNTAIN SHEEP.

211\. *Free translation*.

Far beyond he appears;  
Now "Slender Horn" appears.  
His antlers are becoming. He appears.

Far beyond he appears;  
Now "Turgid Horn" appears.  
His horns are becoming. He appears.

212\. This song, it is said, refers to the time when the prophet saw the
vision of the black sheep on the rock. (Paragraph 35.) The reason for
introducing the deer into the song is not obvious.

At the foot of the blue mountain,  
Lays down her child.

222\. The characters of Tsilkè-¢igìni and Tcikè-¢igìni are in the myth.
The black mountain pertains to the male, the blue to the female.
Although not told with the rest of the myth, it was subsequently related
to the writer that Tsilkè-¢igìni said to the prophet, "Whoever learns

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

our songs will thenceforth be Our child." The above song, it is said,
has some reference to this promise; but a fuller explanation, no doubt,
remains to be discovered.

There's a god on each side.  
Now the Holy Young Woman  
Is the god on top of the blue mountain,  
With her blue notched stick,  
The implement of her dance, her magic wand.

226\. This song is said to refer to that part of the myth where it is
related that the prophet, flying from the Ute, climbed a hill which was
transformed into a mountain. (Paragraph 38.) Each mountain was supposed
to have a holy one on it, who could, by means of his notched stick,
produce the metamorphosis. The mountains were not necessarily colored
black and blue, but are thus described to indicate that they lay north
and south of the prophet's path. (Paragraph 171.)

227\. TWELFTH SONG OF THE HOLY YOUNG MEN.

Eâîèa qàla éla yaináhe oöhè.

228\. *Translation*.--1, 4. Dsil, mountain; ¢ilhyíl, black; çolíj, blue.
2,5. Tsintsò, a notched stick used in ceremonies to make music; inlo
(inla\`), they lie there (two long hard things lie). 3, 6. Cigèl, my
ultimatum, my desideratum (said of the peculiar sacrifice which belongs
to each god), something I (the god) will have and accept nothing in
place of it, my special sacrifice.

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

229\. *Free translation*.

There lie the black mountains:  
There lie the black sticks;  
There lie my sacrifices.

There lie the blue mountains;  
There lie the blue sticks;  
There lie my sacrifices.

230\. This is supposed to be a part of the instructions which the Holy
Young Men and Holy Young Women gave to the prophet. The tsintso is made
of cherry, which grows only on high mountains in the Navajo country. The
sticks are painted black and blue. (See paragraph 171.) The song alludes
to all these facts.

231\. EIGHTH SONG OF THE YOUNG WOMEN WHO BECOME BEARS.

234\. This is supposed to refer to an altercation between these two
gods, in which they tried to belittle each other.

235\. I have another song of this series, in which the idea is conveyed
that their powers depend on their magic wands or notched sticks.
