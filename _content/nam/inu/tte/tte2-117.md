117\. A<span class="small">N</span> O<span class="small">LD</span>
M<span class="small">AN, WHO WAS ALWAYS ANXIOUS TO OUTDO OTHER</span>
P<span class="small">EOPLE</span>, had laid a bet with his friend as to
whose wife should first get a son; and afterwards, as to which of their
sons should in course of time become the greatest angakok. One of them,
Ajagutarsuk, attained angakok wisdom in a cave; and the other, named
Ularpana, acquired it in a dried-up lake. The latter went on an angakok
flight to the first, and while staying with him Ajagutarsuk called forth
his tornaks, which belonged to the inlanders, and instantly appeared.
But Ularpana invoked his tornaks, being the upper ingnersuit, who
totally defeated the inlanders.
