class="small">RNASUGAUSSAK</span>, on being scolded by her parents for
having broken her mother's precious needle, fled with her daughter to
the inland, where they lived with people, who after a while were
transformed into partridges, and afterwards with others who changed into
reindeers. Finally, they returned to the sea-coast, and saw some men
flensing a whale. While standing calling out to them they were converted
into stones.
