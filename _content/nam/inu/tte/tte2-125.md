125\. T<span class="small">HE</span> G<span class="small">IFTS FROM
THE</span> U<span class="small">NDER-WORLD</span>.—An old bachelor,
feeling envious of a younger one because of his better luck in hunting
and his finding more favour with women, applied to his mother for
counsel and aid. She pointed out to him a certain spot where he would
find a large stone, and moving it aside, an opening would appear leading
straight to the under-world, where he would come to a lake; and on
seeing two boats, he was to let the first one pass, but was to apply to
the second. Acting upon her advice, he received a piece of *matak*
(whale-skin) from the second boat, by eating which he acquired
astonishing good-luck in hunting. The young man, noticing this change of
fortune, questioned him as to the cause of his recent success, when he
imparted to him the information he had gained from his mother, only
substituting the first boat for the second. The young man in this way
also got a piece of matak, by eating which he only secured the worst
luck in his hunting. Meanwhile the old man had consumed his piece, and
went to fetch more; but when he came to the spot the second time, he
found himself quite unable to move the stone.
