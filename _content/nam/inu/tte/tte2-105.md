105\. T<span class="small">HE</span> K<span
class="small">IDNAPPERS</span>.—A band of brothers tried to carry off a
girl by force; but her mother, by means of a magic lay, caused them all
to perish in a sudden gale. Some time after, an angakok, who had been
out kayaking, stated that he had seen a shoal of dolphins; and listening
to their speech, he made them out to be those brothers, who had been
thus transformed.
