108\. T<span class="small">HE</span> B<span class="small">IRD'S</span>
C<span class="small">LIFF</span>.—A father and his son, while kayaking
far off the land, fell in with a kayariak, who at once gave chase to
them. They fortunately escaped by jumping out on a flake of ice, from
which they struck their persecutor dead; but before sinking into the sea
he spat repeatedly, turning round to all parts of the horizon, on which
a dense fog arose, causing them to wander, and preventing their gaining
their home. At last they reached land, and the father, being angakok,
soon perceived a house and entered it. They found one side of it
inhabited by black people, and the other by white ones. After staying a
while and having some talk with the inmates on both sides, they left the
house; but on looking behind them, they saw that the house was a cave in
the rock, the inhabitants gulls and ravens, and a drollish visitor
staying with them, a falcon.
