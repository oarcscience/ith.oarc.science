### V.—T<span class="small">RADITIONAL</span> T<span class="small">ALES</span>, S<span class="small">CIENCE, AND</span> A<span class="small">RTS</span>.

In the Introduction to the Tales and Traditions which precedes them we
shall endeavour to explain the probable origin and the significance of
the tales, as representing the science, poetry, and religious doctrines
of the nation. While these three elements are generally <span
id="page_65">p. 65</span> more or less associated, there are many tales
in which one of them may be said to predominate, so that these might
with propriety be called either religious, historical, or merely amusing
tales. Anything traditional, apart from the tales, which could in any
sense be called science, is only to be found in the angakok-wisdom, in
addition to some trifling knowledge of medicine, of astronomy, and of
dividing the year into seasons in conformity with the wanderings of
animals, the position of the sun, moon, and stars, and other scanty
observations derived from experience. Art, on the contrary, we may
properly consider to be separately represented by songs, already
mentioned as an entertainment at the festive meetings. In being recited
or intoned, it will be remembered that they combined mimicry and music
with poetry. To be properly appreciated, even the tales must be heard in
Greenland, related by a native *raconteur* in his own language; but the
songs are still more unfit for rendering by writing or translation, the
words themselves being rather trifling, the sentences abrupt, and the
author evidently presuming the audience to be familiar with the whole
subject or gist of the song, and able to guess the greater part of it.
Every strophe makes such an abrupt sentence, or consists of single and
even abbreviated words, followed by some interjectional words only used
for songs and without any particular signification. The gesticulations
and declamation, accompanied by the drum, are said to have been very
expressive, while the melody itself was rather monotonous and dull. The
old mode of singing is now nearly extinct in the Danish districts of
Greenland. The author, however, succeeded in collecting several songs
which were still remembered, of which the following may serve as
samples. The first is given for this purpose in the original language,
with the interjectional burden complete as it is said by the natives to
have been sung.

A NITH-SONG OF KUKOOK,

who was a bad hunter, but anxious to acquire the friendship of the
Europeans; sung about sixty years ago at a large meeting in the
southernmost part of Greenland.

*Translation*.

The wicked little Kukook imakayah hayah, imakayah hah—hayah uses to say,
. . . . I am going to leave the country . . . . in a large ship . . . .
for that sweet little woman. . . . . I'll try to get some beads . . . .
of those that look like boiled ones. . . . . Then when I've gone abroad,
. . . . I shall return again. . . . . My nasty little relatives . . . .
I'll call them all to me . . . . and give them a good thrashing . . . .
with a big rope's end. . . . . Then I'll go to marry, . . . . taking two
at once. . . . . That darling little creature . . . . shall only wear
clothes of the spotted seal-skins, . . . . and the other little pet . .
. . shall have clothes of the young hooded seals. . . . .

 

MUTUAL NITH-SONG BETWEEN SAVDLADT AND PULANGITSISSOK.

(*From East Greenland*.)

*Savdlat*. The south, the south, oh the south yonder. . . When settling
on the midland coast I met Pulangitsissok, . . . who had grown stout and
fat with eating halibut. . . . Those people from the midland coast they
don't know speaking, . . . because they are ashamed of their speech. . .
. Stupid <span id="page_68">p. 68</span> they are besides. . . . Their
speech is not alike, . . . some speak like the northern, some like the
southern; . . . therefore we can't make out their talk.

*Pulangitsissok*. There was a time when Savdlat wished that I should be
a good kayaker, . . . that I could take a good load on my kayak. . . .
Many years ago some day he wanted me to put a heavy load on my kayak. .
. . (This happened at the time) when Savdlat had his kayak tied to mine
(for fear of being capsized). . . . Then he could carry plenty upon his
kayak. . . . When I had to tow thee, and thou didst cry most pitiful, .
. . and thou didst grow afeared, . . . and nearly wast upset, . . . and
hadst to keep thy hold by help of my kayak strings.

 

A SONG FRON SANERUT.

(*South Greenland*.)

I behold yon land of Nunarsuit; . . the mountaintops on its south side
are wrapped in clouds; . . it slopes towards the south, . . towards
Usuarsuk. . . What couldst thou expect in such a miserable place? . . .
All its surroundings being shrouded with ice, . . not before late in the
spring can people from there go travelling.

 

A SONG FROM ARSUT.

(*South Greenland*.)

The great Koonak mount yonder south, . . I do behold it; . . the great
Koonak mount yonder south, . . I regard it; . . the shining brightness
(clouds ?) yonder south, . . I contemplate. . . Outside of <span
id="page_69">p. 69</span> Koonak . . it is expanding, . . the same that
Koonak towards the seaside . . doth quite encompass. . . Behold how in
the south . . they (clouds ?) shift and change. . . Behold how yonder
south . . they tend to beautify each other, . . while from the seaside
it (the mountain-top) is enveloped . . in sheets still changing, . .
from the seaside enveloped, . . to mutual embellishment.

 

ANOTHER SONG FROM ARSUT.

Towards the south I ever turn my gaze, . . for at the point of Isua
land, . . for near the strand of Isua, . . yonder from the south he will
appear; . . that way he certainly will come. . . Korsarak is sure to
clear the point, . . no doubt Korsarak will be equal to it (in his
kayak). . . But if still he did not happen to come, . . not until the
season of the halibuts, . . not before the halibut-fishing begins, . .
not until the men are hauling up the halibuts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

These latter songs, of course, like the first, have different
interjectional burdens added to the strophes, here only separated by
dotted lines.

Lastly, it must be noticed that though the present Greenlanders appear
to have a pretty fair talent for drawing and writing, scarcely any
traces of the arts of drawing and sculpture belonging to earlier times
remain, with the exception of a few small images cut out in wood or
bone, which have probably served children as playthings. The western
Eskimo, on the other hand, displayed great skill in carving bone
ornaments principally on their weapons and tools.
