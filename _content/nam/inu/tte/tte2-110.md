110\. A<span class="small">N</span> A<span class="small">NGAKOK
ON</span> K<span class="small">EKERTARSUAK</span> set off in his sledge
to visit his married sister. On approaching the house his dogs suddenly
stopped. After in vain trying to urge them on with his whip, he alighted
and went up to the house on foot. But seeing no people about, he looked
in at the window, and was horror-struck at seeing all the people lying
or sitting about lifeless, their eyes open and staring. His sister alone
showed signs of life, and seeing her brother, began to move her mouth as
if chewing, and crept towards the entrance. At sight of this he was
struck with terror, and fled to his <span id="page_453">p. 453</span>
dogs, but was again unable to make them stir. Not until the sister had
come quite close, her mouth widely opened as if to devour him, did they
suddenly start; and thus he escaped to his home. Afterwards he performed
a conjuration, and undertook an angakok flight to examine the place. On
his return he reported that those people had been frightened to death by
the sight of a skin-cover from a kayak (viz., which had been used at a
funeral to carry the corpse upon).
