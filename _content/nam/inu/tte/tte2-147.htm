<P class=indent>147. T<SMALL>HE</SMALL> O<SMALL>CEAN</SMALL>-S<SMALL>PIDER</SMALL>.&#8212;A kayaker in the firth of Godthaab once, at a place where no shoal was known to exist, saw the bottom quite close to him. He then suddenly recollected to have heard old people talking of the ocean-spider, a most dangerous animal to the kayakers. Presently he discovered a monstrous eye, and at the distance of about a kayak-paddle's length from it a similar one, and on tearing away from the spot a terrible gap made its appearance. Indeed, if he had been a less skilled kayaker, he would never have got off alive.</P>
