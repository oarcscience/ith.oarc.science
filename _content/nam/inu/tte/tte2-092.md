92\. T<span class="small">HE</span> W<span class="small">OMAN WHO WANTED
TO BE A</span> M<span class="small">AN</span>.—A woman named Arnarkuak
would not give up scolding <span id="page_443">p. 443</span> her son on
account of his want of skill in hunting and other manly pursuits. Once
in his absence, when he had gone out kayaking, she forced her
daughter-in-law, by threatening her with death, to flee with her to the
interior of the country, where she disguised herself like a man, and had
her daghter-in-law, Ukuamak, for a wife. But the son found out their
place of refuge, and killed his despicable mother.
