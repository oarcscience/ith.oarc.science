<P class=indent>114. T<SMALL>HE</SMALL> L<SMALL>AND OF THE</SMALL> I<SMALL>SARUKITSOK</SMALL> B<SMALL>IRD</SMALL> (<I>Alca impennis</I>), a story from South Greenland.&#8212;Two young men with one elder companion lost their way when kayaking in foggy weather, and having roamed about without being able to sight any land, they came to a high promontory, showing one continuous steep and inaccessible cliff, inhabited by crowds of isarukitsoks. By following the coast they at last came to a landing-place, and found a nice situation, where they rested themselves, and had their strength restored by eating birds. Having also filled their kayaks with them, they put off to sea again, and happened to pass by one of the monstrous gulls which are in the habit of picking up the kayakers and giving them as food to their young ones; but they reached their home in safety. It is told that before the land of the isarukitsok sank there were plenty of these birds about Nook (Godthaab).</P>
