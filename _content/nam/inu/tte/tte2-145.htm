<P class=indent>145. T<SMALL>HE</SMALL> S<SMALL>HARK AS</SMALL> P<SMALL>ROVIDER</SMALL>.&#8212;A mother with her daughter being abandoned by their relatives, and helpless, were saved from starvation by a dead seal which drifted to the shore. After a time they found another, and a shark appeared to them, rising out of the sea, and saying that now he would supply all their wants. He took up his abode with them; and afterwards, when some inuarutligaks were approaching, he took the two women on his back, along with all their implements, and brought them away to an island.</P>
