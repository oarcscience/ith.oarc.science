126\. T<span class="small">HE</span> T<span
class="small">UPILAK</span>.—An old man named Nikook, who had given up
seal-hunting, once, entirely by chance, brought home a walrus. The
middle one of some brothers with whom he lived grew jealous of him at
this, and every morning repaired to the opposite shore of an island,
where he secretly worked at a tupilak. Nikook got a suspicion of this,
and following him, he surprised the wretch in the act of allowing his
own body to be sucked by the monster, at the same time repeating the
words, "Thou shalt take Nikook." But Nikook hurried down, and seized
him, crying, "What art thou doing there?" At that moment the man fell
down lifeless. Meanwhile the brothers had also reached the island, and
on being guided to the place by Nikook, they found <span

then killed it with stones, sinking it, as well as the maker of it, into
the sea. During five nights Nikook was disturbed by a bubbling sound,
but afterwards nothing more was perceived.
