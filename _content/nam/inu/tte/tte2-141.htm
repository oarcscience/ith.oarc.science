<P class=indent>141. A T<SMALL>ALE FROM</SMALL> E<SMALL>AST</SMALL> G<SMALL>REENLAND</SMALL>.&#8212;Two cousins loved each other, but one of them having a passion for outdoing other people, grew irritated at seeing the other not only getting first married, but also having the first son, and that one catching seals before his own son had got a bird. He then removed to another place, and his son trained a dog to tear men to pieces, by feeding it with food that had been in contact with human bones. It had already devoured several travellers when the cousin and his son came and attacked the dangerous animal, and killed it between them.</P>
