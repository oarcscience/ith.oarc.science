137\. S<span class="small">AUGAK</span> had a quarrel with his brother
and fled. He came to a house of such length that a man could wear out
the soles of his boots wandering from one end to the other. The master
of the house had a crowd of daughters, and an immense stock of
provisions. He ordered meat to be served up for Saugak, and forced <span
id="page_467">p. 467</span> him to eat. When Saugak declared that he was
satiated, his host went on to point his knife at his eyes, saying that
as long as he could twinkle them he could also eat. When he finally left
off twinkling they served up dried human flesh before him.
