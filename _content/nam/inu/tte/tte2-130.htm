<P class=indent>130. T<SMALL>HE</SMALL> H<SMALL>ELP FROM</SMALL> I<SMALL>NGNERSUIT</SMALL>.&#8212;An old man once met with an ingnersuak, who invited him to his house, and told him that he had watched in order to have some talk with him that no one else might hear. He wanted to let him know that, if ever he was in want, he only had to apply to him for help&#8212;the ingnersuak would at any time provide him with food. The old man from this time had a comfortable life, being always supplied with what he required. But at last he began to hint at the source of his riches to other people, and henceforth the ingnersuak declined to assist him further.</P>
