<P class=indent>140. A W<SMALL>OMAN NAMED</SMALL> A<SMALL>RNASUGAUSSAK</SMALL>, on being scolded by her parents for having broken her mother's precious needle, fled with her daughter to the inland, where they lived with people, who after a while were transformed into partridges, and afterwards with others who changed into reindeers. Finally, they returned to the sea-coast, and saw some men flensing a whale. While standing calling out to them they were converted into stones.</P>
