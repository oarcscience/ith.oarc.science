<P class=indent>116. T<SMALL>HE</SMALL> K<SMALL>UINASARINOOK</SMALL>.&#8212;Uvnek, one of the last angakut at the firth of Godthaab, on one of his spirit-flights narrowly escaped being taken by an <I>amarsiniook</I>. After his return he once performed a conjuration and summoned the <I>amarsiniook</I>. A brightness was observed, and a voice was heard from above the house saying, "If thou hadst not happened to be an angakok thou wouldst never have escaped; it was I who killed the <I>kuinasarinook</I> (another monster, dwelling in certain mountains), because it had torn a man to pieces." The auditors then remembered how some time ago a man had been found dead, and his body terribly mutilated; but nobody had been able to make out how the murder was committed, till it was thus explained by Uvnek.</P>
