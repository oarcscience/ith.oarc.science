150\. O<span class="small">RDLAVARSUK</span> despised the angakut, and
never used to attend their conjurations. But once spending an evening at
another place, in a house where an angakok went on performing his art,
he became so fond of the women's song, that suddenly he took a fancy to
become an angakok himself. Imitating the angakut's fashion, he betook
himself to lonely places, and called for a tornak. At length a
giant-like man appeared, armed with a long staff, with which he would
touch him. But Ordlavarsuk got terrified, and turning round to the beach
walked through some shallow water to an island, whither the demon was
unable to follow him. The tornak having in vain offered himself to his
disposal, turned back and disappeared. Ordlavarsuk then repenting his
foolishness, called out for him again, but received no answer, and never
more succeeded in calling forth a tornak.
