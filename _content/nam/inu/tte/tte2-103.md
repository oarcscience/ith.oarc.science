103\. A<span class="small">KLAUJAK, A</span> T<span class="small">ALE
FROM</span> L<span class="small">ABRADOR</span>.—A man named Aklaujak
was of immense strength. Once, when away on a reindeer-hunt, his
brothers robbed him of his wife. But the mother, who from a high hill
observed him sitting in his kayak and seizing two large reindeers by the
antlers and drowning them by holding them under water, hastened down and
persuaded the wife to return to him, on which the brothers took flight.
