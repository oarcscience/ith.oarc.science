<P class=indent>117. A<SMALL>N</SMALL> O<SMALL>LD</SMALL> M<SMALL>AN, WHO WAS ALWAYS ANXIOUS TO OUTDO OTHER</SMALL> P<SMALL>EOPLE</SMALL>, had laid a bet with his friend as to whose wife should first get a son; and afterwards, as to which of their sons should in course of time become the greatest angakok. One of them, Ajagutarsuk, attained angakok wisdom in a cave; and the other, named Ularpana, acquired it in a dried-up lake. The latter went on an angakok flight to the first, and while staying with him Ajagutarsuk called forth his tornaks, which belonged to the inlanders, and instantly appeared. But Ularpana invoked his tornaks, being the upper ingnersuit, who totally defeated the inlanders.</P>
