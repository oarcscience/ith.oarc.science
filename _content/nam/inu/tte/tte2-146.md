146\. A W<span class="small">OMAN NAMED</span> A<span
class="small">LEKAKUKIAK</span> had been allied to her enemies by the
bands of marriage. A poor old wife, to whom she had shown much kindness,
once informed her of her brothers-in-law intending to kill her. On
hearing this she fled to the inland, where she first met with a bear.
Having no sort of weapon whatever, she took a string from her hood, and
cracking it like a whip in the front of the animal, she made it fall to
the <span id="page_471">p. 471</span> ground. She proceeded in the same
manner with an amarok, and at length she reached the sea on the other
side, and came to her relatives.

<span class="small">N<span class="small">OTE</span>.—A very similar, but
equally trifling and insignificant fragment, has been received from
Labrador.</span>
