128\. T<span class="small">HE</span> I<span class="small">NHABITANTS
OF</span> A<span class="small">KILINEK</span>.—Iviangersook, while
travelling far and wide for some time, settled down in Akilinek, leaving
descendants there. Many years after, some people from the farthest
north, in crossing the ice, came to a crevice far off the coast, and had
some talk with people who appeared on the opposite side and announced
themselves as Iviangersook's descendants in Akilinek. The countrymen
from each side alternately enumerated all the products of their
homesteads.
