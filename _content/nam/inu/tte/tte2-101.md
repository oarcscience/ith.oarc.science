101\. M<span class="small">ALARSUAK, A</span> S<span class="small">TORY
FROM</span> E<span class="small">AST</span> G<span
class="small">REENLAND</span>.—A man named Malarsuak started in search
of his lost sister. Travelling by sledge, he came to houses inhabited by
cannibals, with one of which he found his sister domesticated. A
hideous-looking youth came into the house, whom Malarsuak killed by
piercing his head with a bear's tooth fastened into a stick, whereupon
the host threw the dead body under the bench. Some time after a woman
appeared, saying, "Is this not my miserable son here—I mean the one who
ought to serve as food for his brothers?" Malarsuak travelled homewards,
but came back on a visit, bringing his wife and a little child with him.
The cannibals robbed them of their child. When going to leave, the
brother-in-law tried to persuade him first to cut all the lashings of
his <span id="page_449">p. 449</span> place-fellows' sledges, in order
to prevent their pursuing the travellers. Malarsuak took his advice, but
happened to forget one of the sledges, which came speeding after him;
but he killed the driver and made his escape himself.
