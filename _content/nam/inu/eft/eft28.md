### THE WOMAN WITH THE IRON TAIL

THERE was once a woman who had an iron tail. And more than this, she was
also an eater of men. When a stranger came to visit her, she would wait
until her guest had fallen asleep, and then she would jump up in the
air, and fall down upon the sleeping one, who was thus pierced through
by her tail.

 Once there came a man to her house. And he lay down to sleep. And when
she thought he had fallen asleep, she jumped up, and coming over the
place where he lay, dropped down upon him. But the man was not asleep at
all, and he moved aside so that she fell down on a stone and broke her
tail.

 The man fled out to his kayak. And she ran after.

 When she reached him, she cried:

 "Oh, if I could only thrust my knife into him."

 And as she cried, the man nearly upset—for even her words had power.

 "Oh, if only I could send my harpoon through her," cried the man in
return. And so great was the power of his words that she tell down on
the spot.

 And then the man rowed away, and the woman never killed anyone after
that, for her tail was broken.
