### 9. The Brothers held Captive on an Island. <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5)

   Two brothers were carried away by a gale, and came to an island in
the ocean. The islanders captured them. The younger brother set off in
search of the lost ones. He came to the island, and happened to overhear
two old women who were talking about the event to take place the next
morning. The two prisoners were to be sacrificed to the Sea-God. He
killed one of the old women, skinned her, and put on her skin and her
clothes. He also hid three long knives in one of the legs of her
breeches.

   The Strong-Man of the village sent two men to bring the old woman to
the place of sacrifice. They took her under their arms and brought her
there. "Oh," said the Strong-Man, "how is it that your shoulders have
come to be so broad?" — "Through my great desire to see the sacrifice."
They placed the old woman between the two prisoners. Then they killed a
slave as a peace-offering to the intended victims. But the old woman cut
the thongs of the prisoners, and gave each a knife. Then the three
killed all the people of the village. The three brothers went to another
village, and the elder two married there. The youngest brother returned
home, and found there his own son, who was now an old man, quite bent
down, and walking with a staff. His father, however, was still quite
young.

Told by Tal‘i´mak, an Asiatic Eskimo man, in the village of Uñi´sak, at
Indian Point, May, 1901.
