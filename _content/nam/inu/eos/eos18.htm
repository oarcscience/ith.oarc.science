<p>Ra&acute;wta&#269;haw exerted himself more than all other men, more than you. In these exertions he vanquished you, he will vanquish them also. Eskimo women were saying, "We will cut up for him this crab-meat."</p>

<p>At the cape of U&ntilde;i&acute;sak, at the pretty one, O girls! I learned a song, good for singing, a pretty one. The steamboats were already coming.</p>  
<p>At the cape of U&ntilde;i&acute;sak, at the pretty one, O boys! I learned a song, good for singing, a pretty one. O boys! You are my assistants (in singing), you never refuse. My heart yearns for King Island, for the woman A&#269;a&acute;ka.</p>

<p>O man! I sing shaman songs which are destined to give protection from evil spirits to your living-place. Enough, I cease to sing.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">2 (<i>c</i>).</h3>  
<p>Oh, it is strange! This man all the time induces us to be his teachers in singing, so that we grew poor in songs. I have no more new songs.</p>  
<p>My heart yearns only there to the village of Kakma&acute;lik,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to the woman who sings well, who dances well.

And when one turns away, they say to another man, "Come here, come here!"</p>  
<p>Why, Ka&acute;lmik here sang quite well, and she was not married. Oh, we two shall have a singing-match! But I cannot surpass you. Oh, there, I cease!

<p>How is it, my own ears heard the report of that rifle. I should like to eat of that reindeer-buck (i. e., killed with a shot). I have consumed the whole of it. Now where shall I eat some seaweed?

They are placed together here because they were given by one man. The first one (<i>a</i>) is a dialogue between a man and a to&acute;&#7771;na&#7771;ak named Alaka&acute;l&#7883;. The second question of the man &#8212; "And who are you?" &#8212; addressed to the to&acute;&#7771;na&#7771;ak is omitted. The last song (<i>d</i>) is largely in Chukchee. Only the word "kayalka&acute;tiu" and the last sentence are Eskimo, but the tune to which it was sung was also Eskimo. "Ya&ntilde;iya&acute; h&#7883;ya&ntilde;a&acute;," etc., are burdens without any particular meaning. In singing, they are repeated several times. The word "taxluweiu&acute;wa" in 1 (<i>d</i>), line 2, was also said to be a burden without meaning, although I am not quite sure of this.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_14"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_13">437:3</A> Ta&#7771;u for yuk ("man") belongs to the so-called language of the to&acute;&#7771;na&#7771;aks.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_15"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_16">439:1</A> The singing person was hoarse at that time.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_16"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_17">439:3</A> Literally, i&acute;&#7771;lak ("throat").</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_17"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_18">439:4</A> That is, the writer of these lines.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_18"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_19">440:1</A> A village on the American side.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_19"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_20">440:3</A> The following part of this song is in the dialect of N&#7883;bu&acute;kak, and has been translated literally into the dialect of U&ntilde;i&acute;sak.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_20"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_21">441:1</A> The man who sits at the prow is the first to throw the harpoon in seal and walrus hunting. This is a place of honor. Hai&acute;t&#7883;, of whom the song speaks, was an Eskimo of the American shore. He was the cousin of Tal&#8216;i&acute;mak on the mother's side. He actually knew how to read and write.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_21"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_22">441:2</A> The words left without translation represent simply imitation of English words put in for fun. <font size="-1" color="green">These words were moved from the transcription of the Chukchee original.</font></P>
<P><A NAME="fn_22"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_23">442:1</A> &#268;a&#7771;oia&acute;lik, "shaman" (literally, "that with the drum"), belongs to the language of to&acute;&#7771;na&#7771;aks.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_23"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_24">442:2</A> Words left without translation represent a set of Eskimo names put in for fun.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_24"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_25">442:3</A> Mai&acute;o, to whom these three songs belong, died of measles a year before my coming there. He was a hunchback, and feeble of body. Nevertheless he was quite popular among his companions on account of his inexhaustible good humor. The songs of Mai&acute;o were known by heart, word for word, by several boys and girls of U&ntilde;i&acute;sak. Mai&acute;o, like all the young men, had a strong desire to leam some English. Having no means to do so, he would imitate English sounds and words, and put them into his songs. The songs of Mai&acute;o probably represent parodies of the solemn shamanistic songs of the grown-up people.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_25"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_26">443:1</A> The last words could not be explained by the singer. They either belong to the ancient, now unused forms of speech, or, what is more probable, represent a series of casual sounds, having no meaning. This latter happens quite frequently in the Eskimo songs.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_26"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_27">444:1</A> Kupu&acute;ma, "woman" (literally, "that cut in two"). This word belongs to the language of to&acute;&#7771;na&#7771;aks.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_27"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_28">444:2</A> Cama&acute;tak, a forehead ornament made of iron, and given by shamans to a patient to carry as a magic remedy.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_28"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_29">445:1</A> These two songs, according to the explanations of the singer and her companions, are of ancient origin. When they are sung, the listeners clap their palms in time.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_29"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_30">445:2</A> These shamanistic songs represent incantations connected wilh the walrus-hunt. Others are sung in the great winter ceremonials. Some were inherited by the old man who sang them, from his father. Others belong to his son, to his daughter, etc. The six songs have no connection one with another.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_30"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_31">446:1</A> Ta&acute;&#7771;u is the word of the language of to&acute;&#7771;na&#7771;aks for "man," Taru&acute;ni maku&acute;ni is vocative plural.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_31"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_32">446:2</A> <font size="-1" color="green">Kaara&acute;mkak.</font> From the Chukchee Qa&acute;a-ra&acute;mkin (literally "Reindeer People"). Compare Bogoras (Vol. VII of this series, p. 19). The Eskimo never meet the Tungus. This is the only mention of the Tungus in Eskimo folk-lore.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_32"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_33">446:3</A> The narrator speaks here of a sea-deity, which, according to his explanations, is a female, like the well-known Sedna of all the Eskimo.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_33"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_34">446:4</A> That is, the walrus.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_34"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_35">446:5</A> The hunter who kills walrus on the ice, cuts the carcass to pieces, and hauls every piece upon the ice, holding it by the holes that are cut through the meat. In stretching the walrus-hide for drying, similar holes are cut all around the edge. They are also called pu&acute;tu&ntilde;uk (the Chukchee word "p&#629;tt&#7883;&ntilde;a&acute;lhin" is borrowed from the Eskimo).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_35"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_36">446:6</A> Aku&acute;&#7771;um, "food," in the language of to&acute;&#7771;na&#7771;aks.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_36"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_37">446:7</A> Tuwu&acute;til&#8216;ik, "walrus" (literally, "the with tusks"), in the language of to&acute;&#7771;na&#7771;aks.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_37"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_38">448:1</A> Ku&acute;&#7771;ak, "child," in the language of to&acute;&#7771;na&#7771;aks.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_38"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_39">448:2</A> Yuwu&acute;sik, in usual speech &#7883;yu&acute;s&#183;ik ("body"). Here it means, however, "soul." &#7883;yu&acute;sik means, properly speaking, "self," "human self," and is derived from yuk ("man").</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_39"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_40">448:3</A> Kakcu&acute;bak was a shaman, though of no great skill. He pretended that his song was sung wholly in the language of to&acute;&#7771;na&#7771;aks, and so refused to translate it into the usual human speech, and even affirmed that he does not understand these strange words. In reality the song is in the usual U&ntilde;i&acute;sak dialect of the Asiatic Eskimo, and the percentage of words or grammatical forms of unusual character is by no means larger than in the other shamanistic songs.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_40"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_41">448:4</A> Each of these shamanistic songs is a song by itself. They are supposed to be sung by the to&acute;&#7771;na&#7771;ak or the female shaman who sang them, and to be addressed to her. So in several cases I had to translate yuk, &#7883;yu&acute;k, ta&acute;ru, "human being," instead of "man."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_41"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_42">449:1</A> The shaman's staff, with its tassels, is considered to be a magic weapon.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_42"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_43">449:2</A> The spirit used the voice of this female shaman Hi&acute;wu&ntilde;a as his breath.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_43"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_44">449:3</A> In the language of to&acute;&#7771;na&#7771;ak, the shaman, the magic master of the spirits, is always spoken of as "their man," "their woman."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_44"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_45">449:4</A> Literally, "that walking on all-fours." This word belongs to the language of to&acute;&#7771;na&#7771;aks.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_45"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_46">450:4</A> This song was not composed for my own benefit, as one might suppose. It originated a year before my arrival, when the missionary of St. Lawrence, an American, bought a few pieces of brick-tea of Japanese make from the Russian steamer "Progress." The Japanese brick-tea is inferior in quality to that made in China and brought by the Russian traders by land from the west.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_46"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_47">451:1</A> Compare Vol. VII of this series, p. 145.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_47"></A><A HREF="eos18.htm#fr_48">452:3</A> Acu&acute;na&#7771;ak was a shaman, and also a descendant of a family of shamans. His great-grandfather, also Acu&acute;na&#7771;ak by name, had much fame. Even now tales exist about the deeds he achieved. His grandson also showed me a few tricks, some of which I have described elsewhere, (Bogoras, The Chukchee, Vol. VII of this series, p. 448).</P><p><HR>
