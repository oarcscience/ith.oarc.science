### How Glooskap made the Elves and Fairies, and then Man of an Ash Tree, and last of all, Beasts, and of his Coming at the Last Day.

(Passamaquoddy.)

Glooskap came first of all into this country, into Nova Scotia, Maine,
Canada, into the land of the Wabanaki, next to sunrise. There were no
Indians here then (only wild Indians very far to the west).

First born were the Mikumwess, the Oonahgemessuk, the small Elves,
little men, dwellers in rocks.

And in this way he made Man: He took his bow and arrows and shot at
trees, the basket-trees, the Ash. Then Indians came out of the bark of
the Ash-trees.

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And then the
Mikumwess said . . . called tree-man. <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3)
. . .

Glooskap made all the animals. He made them at first very large. Then he
said to Moose, the great Moose who was as tall as Ketawkqu's, <span
id="fr_4"></span>[2](#fn_4) "What would you do should you see an Indian
coming?" Moose replied, "I would tear down the trees on him." Then
Glooskap saw that the Moose was too strong, and made him smaller, so
that Indians could kill him.

Then he said to the Squirrel, who was of the size of a Wolf, What would
you do if you should meet an Indian? And the Squirrel answered, "I would
scratch down trees on him." Then Glooskap said, "You also are too
strong," and he made him little. <span id="fr_5"></span>[3](#fn_5)

Then he asked the great White Bear what he would do if he met an Indian;
and the Bear said, "Eat him." And the Master bade him go and live among
rocks and ice, where he would see no Indians.

So he questioned all the beasts, changing their size or allotting their
lives according to their answers.

He took the Loon for his dog; but the Loon absented himself so much that
he chose for this service two wolves,--one black and one white. <span
id="fr_6"></span>[4](#fn_6) But the Loons are always his tale-bearers.

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

Many years ago a man very far to the North wished to cross a bay, a
great distance, from one point to another. As he was stepping into his
canoe he saw a man with two dogs,--one black and one white,--who asked
to be set across. The Indian said, "You may go, but what will become of
your dogs?" Then the stranger replied, "Let them go round by land."
"Nay," replied the Indian, "that is much too far." But the stranger
saying nothing, he put him across. And as they reached the landing place
there stood the dogs. But when he turned his head to address the man, he
was gone. So he said to himself, "I have seen Glooskap."

Yet again,--but this was not so many years ago, far in the North there
were at a certain place many Indians assembled. And there was a
frightful commotion, caused by the ground heaving and rumbling; the
rocks shook and fell, they were greatly alarmed, and lo! Glooskap stood
before them, and said, "I go away now, but I shall return again; when
you feel the ground tremble, then know it is I." So they will know when
the last great war is to be, for then Glooskap will make the ground
shake with an awful noise.

Glooskap was no friend of the Beavers; he slew many of them. Up on the
Tobaic are two salt-water rocks (that is, rocks by the ocean-side, near
a freshwater stream). The Great Beaver, standing there one day, was seen
by Glooskap miles away, who had forbidden him that place. Then picking
up a large rock where he stood by the shore, he threw it all that

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

distance at the Beaver, who indeed dodged it; but when another came, the
beast ran into a mountain, and has never come forth to this day. But the
rocks which the master threw are yet to be seen.

 

This very interesting tradition was taken down by Mrs. W. Wallace Brown
from a very old Passamaquoddy Indian woman named Molly Sepsis, who could
not speak a word of English, with the aid of another younger woman named
Sarah.

It will be observed that it is said in the beginning that Glooskap
produced the first human beings from the ash-tree. Ash and Elm in the
Edda were the Adam and Eve of the human race. There were no intelligent
men on earth--

"Until there came three  
mighty and benevolent  
Aesir to the world  
from their assembly  
nearly powerless,  
Ash and Embla (Ash and Elm),  
void of destiny.

"Spirit they possessed not,  
sense they had not,  
blood nor motive powers,  
nor goodly color.  
Spirit gave Odin,  
sense gave Hoenir,  
blood gave Lodur  
and good color. " <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7)

 

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

It is certain, however, that the ash was the typic tree of all life,
since the next verse of the Völuspa is devoted to Yggdrasil, the tree of
existence, or of the world itself. It may be observed that in the
Finnish poem of Kalévala it is by the destruction of the great oak that
Wäinämöien, aided by the hero of the sea, causes all things to grow. The
early clearing away of trees, as a first step towards culture, may be
symbolized in the shooting of arrows at the ash.

The wolf, as a beast for the deity to ride, is strongly Eddaic.

"Magic songs they sung,  
rode on Wolves,  
the god (Odin) and gods. <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8)

We have here within a few lines, accordingly, the ash as the parent of
mankind, and wolves as the beasts of transport for the supreme deity,
both in the Indian legend and in the Edda.

As Glooskap is directly declared in one tradition to keep by him as an
attendant a being who is the course of the sun and of the seasons, it
may be assumed that the black and white wolf represent day and night.

Again, great stress is laid in the Glooskap legend upon the fact that
the last great day of battle with Malsum. the Wolf, and the
frost-giants, stone-giants, and other powers of evil, shall be announced
by an earthquake.

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

"Trembles Yggdrasil's  
Ash yet standing,  
groans that aged tree . . .  
and the Wolf runs . . .  
The monster's kin goes  
all with the Wolf. . . .  
Tile stony hills are dashed together,  
The giantesses totter.  
Then arises Hlin's second grief  
When Odin goes  
with the wolf to fight."

Word for word, ash-tree, giantesses, the supreme god fighting with a
wolf, and falling hills, are given in the Indian myth. This is not the
Christian Day of Judgment, but the Norse.

In this myth Glooskap has two wolves, one black and the other white.
This is an indication of day and night, since he is distinctly stated to
have as an attendant Kulpejotei, who typifies the course of the seasons.
In the Eddas (Ragnarok) we are told that one wolf now follows the, sun,
another the moon; one Fenris, the other Moongarm:—

"The moon's devourer  
In a troll's disguise."

The magic arrows of Glooskap are of course worldwide, and date from the
shafts of Abaris and those used among the ancient Jews for divination.
But it may be observed that those of the Indian hero are like the "Guse
arrows," described in Oervarodd's

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Saga, which always
hit their mark and return to the one who shoots them. <span
id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9)

It is important here to compare this *old* Algonquin account of the
Creation with that of the Iroquois, or Six Nations, as given by David
Cusick, himself an Indian:—

"There was a woman who was with child, with twins. She descended from
the higher world, and was received on the turtle. While she was in the
distress of travail, one of the infants in her womb was moved by an evil
desire, and determined to pass out under the side of the parent's arm,
and the other infant endeavored in vain to prevent his design. They
entered the dark world by compulsion, and their mother expired in a few
minutes. One of them possessed a gentle disposition, and was named
Enigorio, the Good Mind. The other possessed an insolence of character,
and was called Enigonhahetgea; that is, the Bad Mind. The Good Mind was
not content to remain in a dark situation, and was desirous to create a
great light in the dark world; but the Bad Mind was desirous that the
world should remain in its original state. The Good Mind, determined to
prosecute his design, began the work of creation. Of his mother's head
he made the sun, of her body the moon. After he had made creeks and
rivers, animals and fishes, he formed two images of the dust of the
ground in his own likeness, male and female, and by his

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

breathing into their nostrils he gave them living souls, and named them
*ea gwe howe*, that is a real people; and he gave the Great Island all
the animals--of game for the inheritance of the people. . . . The Bad
Mind, while his brother was making the universe, went through the
island, and made numerous high mountains and falls of water and great
steeps, and also created reptiles which would be injurious to mankind;
but the Good Mind restored the island to its former condition. The Bad
Mind made two images of clay in the form of mankind, but while he was
giving them existence they became *apes*. The Good Mind discovered his
brother's contrivances, and aided in giving them living souls.

"Finding that his brother continually thwarted him, the Good Mind
admonished him to behave better. The Bad Mind then offered a challenge
to his brother, on condition that the victor should rule the universe.
The Good Mind was willing. He falsely mentioned that whipping with flags
\[bulrushes\] would destroy his *temporal* life, and earnestly solicited
his brother to observe the instrument of death, saying that by using
deer-horns he would expire. \[This is very obscure in Cusick's
Indian-English.\] On the day appointed the battle began; it lasted for
two days; they tore up the trees and mountains; at last the Good Mind
gained the victory by using the horns. The last words uttered by the Bad
Mind were that he would have equal power over the souls of mankind after
their death, and so sank down to eternal doom and became the Evil
Spirit."

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

Contrasted with this hardly heathen cosmogony, which shows recent Bible
influence throughout, the Algonquin narrative reads like a song from the
Edda. That the latter is the original and the older there can be no
doubt. Between the "Good Mind," making man "from the dust of the earth,"
and Glooskap, rousing him by magic arrows from the ash-tree, there is a
great difference. It may be observed that the fight with horns is
explained in another legend in this book, called the Chenoo, and that
these horns are the magic horns of the Chepitch calm, or Great Serpent,
who is somewhat like the dragon.

In the Algonquin story, two Loons are Glooskap's "tale-bearers," which
occasion him great anxiety by their prolonged absences. This is
distinctly stated in the Indian legend, as it is of Odin's birds in the
Edda. Odin has, as news-bringers, two ravens.

"Hugin and Munin  
Fly each day  
over the spacious earth.  
I fear for Hugin  
that he comes not back,  
yet more anxious am I  
for Munin."

The Loons, indeed, occasioned Glooskap so much trouble by absences that
he took wolves in their place. The ravens of the Edda are probably of
biblical origin. But it is a most extraordinary coincidence that the
Indians have a corresponding perversion of Scripture, for they say that
Glooskap, when he was in

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

the ark, that is as Noah, sent out a white dove, which returned to him
colored black, and became a raven. This is not, however, related as part
of the myth.

The Ancient History of the Six Nations, by David Cusick, gives us in one
particular a strange coincidence with the Edda. It tells us that the Bad
Mind, the principle of Evil, forced himself out into life, as Cusick
expresses it in his broken Indian-English, "under the side of the
parent's arm;" that is, through the armpit. In the Edda (Vafthrudnismal,
33) we are told of the first beings born on earth that they were twins,
begotten by the two feet of a giant, and born out of his armpit.

"Under the armpit grew,  
't is said of the Hrîmthurs,  
a girl and boy together;  
foot with foot begat,  
of that wise Jötun,  
a six-headed son."

There are in these six lines six coincidences with red Indian mythology:
(1.) The Evil principle as a Jötun's first-born in the one and the Bad
Mind in the other are born of the mother's armpit. (2.) In one of the
tales of Lox, the Indian devil, also a giant, we are told that his feet
are male and female. (3.) In both faiths this is the first birth on
earth. (4.) The six-headed demon appears in a Micmac tale. (5.) There is
in both the Eddaic and the Wabanaki account a very remarkable
coincidence in this: that there is a Titanic or giant birth of twins on
earth, followed by

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

the creation of man from the ash-tree. (6.) The Evil principle, whether
it be the Wolf-Lox in the Wabanaki myths, or Loki in the Norse, often
turns himself into a woman. Thus the male and female sex of the
first-born twins is identified.

According to the Edda, the order of births on earth was as follows:—

First, two giants were born from the mother's armpit.

Secondly, the dwarfs were created.

Thirdly, man was made from the ash-tree.

According to the Wabanaki, this was the order:—

First, two giants were born, *one* from his mother's armpit.

Secondly, the dwarfs (Mikumwessuk) were created from the bark of the
ash-tree.

Thirdly, man was made from the *trunk* of the ash.

The account of the creation of the dwarfs is wanting in the present
manuscript.
