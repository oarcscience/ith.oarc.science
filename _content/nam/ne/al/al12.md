### How Glooskap became friendly to the Loons, and made them his Messengers.

(Micmac.)

When Glooskap, was pursuing Win-pe, he one day on Uktukamkw saw from
afar flying over water the Kwe-moo (M.), or Loons. And thrice did their
chief make the circle of the lake, coming near to the land of men and
beasts every time, as if he would fain seek somewhat. Then Glooskap
asking him what he wanted, Kwe-moo replied that he would be his servant
and friend. So Glooskap taught him a strange long cry like the howl of a
dog, and when the loons were in need of him or would pray to him they
were to utter this cry.

And it came to pass that when he was in Newfoundland he came to an
Indian town, and they who dwelt therein were all Kwee-moo-uk, or Loons.
And they, as men, were exceeding glad to see their lord, who had blessed
them as birds, and did their best to

please him. So he made them his huntsmen and messengers, and in all the
tales of Glooskap the Kweemoo ever appears as faithful to him. Whence to
this day, when the Indians hear the cry of the Loon, they say, "*Kwemoo
el-komik-too-ajul Gloocapal*" (He is calling upon Glooskap).
