<p align="center">(Micmac, Passamaquoddy, Penobscot.)</p>  
<p>Over all the Land of the Wabanaki there is no place which was; not marked by the hand of the Master. And it is to be seen on hills and rivers and great roads, as well as mighty rocks, which were in their day living monsters.</p>  
<p>For there is a very wonderful highway from Cwesowra legek&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to Parrsborough, running parallel with</p>  
<p>
</p>

<p>the river now called Hebert, and this road is called by Indians Ou-wokun, the Causeway, but by white men, or the Iglesmani, the Boar's Back. For it is said that he meant to visit Partridge Island and Cape Blomidon, but they who were with him had got tired of the sea, and wished to cross over by land. And while they were resting and getting ready for their trip across, the Master, raising his magic power to a great deed to be spoken of forever, went away a little time, and cast up a great and beautiful level ridge, throwing it over bogs and streams; and on this they traveled, rejoicing, and, having reached the island, awaited him.</p>  
<p>And yet again the Master did a mighty deed. It came to pass in those days that the Beavers had built a dam across from Utkoguncheek, or Cape Blomidon, to the opposite shore, and thereby made a pond that filled all the valley of Annapolis. Now in those times the Beavers were monstrous beasts, and the Master, though kind of heart, seems to have had but little love for them ever since the day when Qwahbeetsis, the son of the Great Beaver, tempted Malsum to slay his brother. Now the bones of these Beavers may be found to this day, and many there are on Oonamahgik, and their teeth are six inches across, and there are no such <i>qwah-beet</i> to-day.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_44"></A><A HREF="#fn_44"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> And these are the remains of the Beavers who built the dam at Cape Blomidon and forded the Annapolis Valley.</p>

<p>Now Glooskap would have a hunt and do a deed which should equal the great whale-fishing of Kitpooseeog-unow. So he cut the great dam near the shore, and bade Marten watch; for he said, "I mistrust that there is a little Beaver hiding hereabouts." And when the dam was cut from where it joined the shore there was a mighty rush of many waters, so that it swung round to the westward, yet it did not break away from the other shore. Therefore the end of it lodged with a great split therein when the flood had found a free course, and the whole may be seen there still, even to this day, and may be seen by all of those who pass up the bay; and this point, or Cape Split, is called by the Micmacs Pleegun, which, being interpreted, means the opening of a beaver dam.</p>  
<p>Then, to frighten the Beaver, Glooskap threw at it a few handfuls of earth, and these, falling somewhat to the eastward of Partridge Island, became the Five Islands. And the pond which was left was the Basin of Minas.</p>  
<p>And yet another tradition tells that, after cutting the dam, Glooskap sat and watched, but no beaver came out;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#fn_45"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> for <i>Qwah-beet</i> had gone out of a back door. So he took a rock and threw it afar,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="#fn_46"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>--one hundred and fifty miles,--to scare the Beaver back again; but the Beaver had gone over the Grand Falls, and the stone remaineth there even to this day.</p>
