<p align="center">(Micmac.)</p>  
<p><i>N'karnayoo</i>: <i>wood-enit-atokhagen Glooskap</i>. Of the old times: this is a story of Glooskap. Now there went forth many men unto Glooskap, hearing that they could win the desires of their hearts; and all got what they asked for, in any case; but as for having what they wanted, that depended on the wisdom with which they wished or acted.</p>  
<p>The good Glooskap liked it not that when he had told any one evenly and plainly what to do, that man should then act otherwise, or double with him. And it came to pass that a certain fool, of the kind who can do nothing unless it be in his own way, made a long journey to the Master. And his trials were indeed many. For he came to an exceeding high mountain in a dark and lonely land, where he heard no sound. And the ascent thereof was like a smooth pole, and the descent on the other side far worse, for it hung over the bottom. Yet it was worse beyond, for there the road lay between the heads of two huge serpents, almost touching each other, who darted their terrible tongues at those who went between. And yet again the path passed under the Wall of Death. Now this wall hung like an awful cloud over a plain, rising and falling at times, yet no man knew when. And when it fell it struck the ground, and that so as to crush all that was beneath it.</p>  
<p>But the young man escaped all these trials, and</p>  
<p><a name="page_95"><font size="1" color="green">p. 95</font></A></p>  
<p>came to the island of the Great Master. And when he had dwelt there a certain time, and was asked what he would have, he replied, "If my lord will, let him give me a medicine which will cure all disease." More than this he asked not. So the Master gave him a certain small package, and said, "Herein is that which thou seekest; but I charge thee that thou lettest not thine eyes behold it until thou shalt reach thy home." So he thanked the Master, and left.</p>  
<p>But he was not far away ere he de sired to open the package and test the medicine, and, yet more, the truth of the Master. And he said to himself, "Truly, if this be but a deceit it was shrewdly devised to bid me not open it till I returned. For he knew well that once so far I would make no second journey to him. Tush! if the medicine avail aught it cannot change in aught." So he opened it, when that which was therein fell to the ground, and spread it self like water everywhere, and then dried away like a mist. And when he returned and told his tale, men mocked him.</p>  
<p>Then again there were three brothers, who, having adventured, made known their wishes. Now the first was very tall, far above all his fellows, and vain of his comeliness. For he was of those who put bark or fur into their moccasins, that they may be looked up to by the little folk and be loved by the squaws; and his hair was plastered to stand up on high, and on the summit of it was a very long turkey-tail feather. And</p>  
<p><a name="page_96"><font size="1" color="green">p. 96</font></A></p>  
<p>this man asked to become taller than any Indian in all the land.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_71"></A><A HREF="#fn_71"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>And the second wished that he might ever remain where he was to behold the land and the beauty of it, and to do naught else.</p>  
<p>And the third wished to live to an exceeding old age, and ever to be in good health.</p>  
<p>Now the three, when they came to the island, had found there three wigwams, and in two of these were dwellers, not spoken of in other traditions. In one lived <i>Cool-puj-ot</i>, a very strange man. For he has no bones, and cannot move himself, but every spring and autumn he is <i>rolled over with handspikes</i> by the order of Glooskap, and this is what his name means in the Micmac tongue. And in the autumn he is turned towards the west, but in the spring towards the east, and this is a figure of speech denoting the revolving seasons of the year. With his breath he can sweep down whole armies, and with his looks alone he can work great wonders, and all this means the weather,--frost, snow, ice, and sunshine.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

<p><a name="page_97"><font size="1" color="green">p. 97</font></A></p>  
<p>And in the other wigwam dwelt <i>Cuhkw</i> (M.), which means Earthquake. And this mighty man can pass along under the ground, and make all things shake and tremble by his power.</p>  
<p>Now when Glooskap had heard what these visitors wished for, he called Earthquake, and bid him take them all three and put them with their feet in the ground. And he did so, when they at once became three trees: as one tradition declares, pines; and another, cedars.</p>  
<p>So that he that would be tall became exceeding tall, for his head rose above the forest; and even the turkey-feather at the top thereof is not forgotten, since to this day it is seen waving in the wind. And he who will listen in a pine-wood may hear the tree murmuring all day long in the Indian tongue of the olden time,--</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">"Ee nil Etuchi nek m'kilaskitopp<br> Ee nil Etuche wiski nek n'kil ooskedjin."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_73"></A><A HREF="#fn_73"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Oh, I am such a great man!<br> Oh, I am such a great Indian!</FONT></p>  
<p>And the second, who would remain in the land, remains there; for while his roots are in the ground he cannot depart from it.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="green">p. 98</font></A></p>  
<p>And the third, who would live long in health, unless men have cut him down, is standing as of yore.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_74"></A><A HREF="#fn_74"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_71"></A><A HREF="al21.htm#fr_71">96:1</A> This story has been told to me in three different forms. I have here given it with great care in what I conceive to be the original. In one version it is the pine, in another the cedar-tree.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_72"></A><A HREF="al21.htm#fr_72">96:2</A> Mr. Rand (manuscript, p. 471) says that all of this explanation was given <i>verbatim</i> by a Micmac named Stephen Flood, who was a "very intelligent and reliable Indian." Cool-puj-ot is almost identical with Shawandasee, the guardian of the South. "He is represented as an affluent, plethoric old man, who has grown unwieldy from repletion, and seldom moves. He keeps his eyes steadfastly fixed on the north.. When he sighs in autumn, <a name="page_97"><font size="1" color="green">p. 97</font></A> we have those balmy southern airs, which communicate warmth and delight over the northern hemisphere, and make the Indian summer." The "affluence "and "grown unwieldy from repletion," in this account, are probably due to Schoolcraft's florid style. (<i>Hiawatha Legends</i>.) Shawandasee is identical with Svasud of the Edda. (Vafthr&ucirc;dnism&acirc;l, 27.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_73"></A><A HREF="al21.htm#fr_73">97:1</A> Passamaquoddy.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_74"></A><A HREF="al21.htm#fr_74">98:1</A> in another version of this tale, Glooskap transformed him into an old gnarled and twisted cedar, with limbs growing out rough and ugly all the way from the bottom. "There," he said to the cedar-tree, "I cannot say how long you will live; only the Great Spirit above can tell that; but you will not be disturbed for a good while, as no one can have any object in cutting you down. You are yourself unfit for any earthly purpose, and the land around you is useless for cultivation. I think you will stand there for a long while." (Rand manuscript.)</p>  
<p>It should be added that in one version we are told that the seeds from these cedars or pines were blown by the wind, and so spread forth all over the earth. The planting of the cedar by Earthquake possibly indicates the storms by which seeds are blown afar.</P>
