### <span id="english">Hymn to Xochiquetzal.</span>

1\. I, Xochiquetzal, go forth willingly to the dancing place by the
water, going forth to the houses in Tamoanchan.

2\. Ye noble youths, ye priests who wept, seeking Xochiquetzal, go forth
there where I am going.

### Notes.

Xochiquetzal, "plumage of flowers," was the deity of the artists, the
painters, weavers, engravers on metal, silver and goldsmiths, and of all
who dealt in fine colors. Her figure was that of a young woman with gay
garments and jewelry (Duran, *Historia*, cap. 94). In the *Codex
Telleriano-Remensis* she is assigned as synonyms *Ichpochtli*, the
Virgin, and *Itzpapalotl*, literally "the obsidian butterfly," but which
was probably applied to a peculiar ornament of her idol.

On *Tamoanchan* see notes to Hymn IV.

{p. 42}

The term *atlayauican*, which I have translated "the dancing place by
the water," appears to refer to the "jar dance," *baile de las jicaras*,
which took place at the festival of the goddess, in the month of
October. Duran informs us this was executed at a spot by the shore of
the lake. Ceremonial bathing was carried on at the same festival, and
these baths were considered to cleanse from sin, as well as from
physical pollution.
