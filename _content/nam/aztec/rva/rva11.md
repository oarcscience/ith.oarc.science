put to flight; even the Mexicans, with my courage, with my skill.

6\. Go forth, ye shield bearers, put the Mexicans to flight with my
courage, with my skill.

{p. 46}

### Notes.

The absence of a Gloss to this hymn adds to the difficulty of a
translation. *Otontecutli* was the chief deity of the Otomis, and the
chant appears to be one of their war songs in their conflict with the
Azteca. The name is a compound of *otomitl*, an Otomi, and *tecutli*,
ruler or lord. He is slightly referred to by Sahagun as the first ruler
to govern the ancestors of the Otomis." (*Historia*, Lib. X, Cap. 29,
sec. 5.)
