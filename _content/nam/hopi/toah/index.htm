This is one of the rarest types of ethnographic documents,
one actually written by a native American.
Mr. Nequatewa ably relates some of the mythological stories also
covered by <A HREF="../toth/index.htm">Voth</A>.
However, the bulk of this book--by far the most valuable
section--covers the historical legends
of the Hopi, from a Hopi viewpoint.
The Hopi 'theory' (Nequatewa's word) was that the
'Bahana' (the white people) emerged from
the under-world alongside the Hopi, and went off in
search of the truth.
Someday they would return and live in harmony with the Hopi, bringing
wisdom and great abundance.
</P>
<P>
So what is the truth of a Hopi?
The return of the Bahana didn't work out quite that way.
The Hopi resisted enculturation, sometimes through armed resistance,
at other times through nonviolent resistance (as when they hide the children
from the policeman coming to take them to the boarding schools).
However, all the while they apparently kept their good natured belief that
someday their ironic 'theory' of the inherent goodness of the whites
would work out.
</P>
<P>
Throughout, Nequatewa relates incidents and characterizations of Hopis
that go far beyond the 'Noble Savage' sterotypes of brave warriors and
laconic wisemen.
The Hopi who occupy these pages are all too human, and that alone is
a drop of truth that is missing from accounts of the Hopi, even to the
present day.
