## 52.--THE KALÁTÖTÖ WHO WISHED TO HAVE HAIR ON HIS HEAD.

Kalátötö often visits Oraíbi to find something to eat among refuse.
Children tease him and snap their fingers against his head so that he
nearly dies. He then retires to house. He wonders how he can get hair on
his head like children, and goes to timber and gets some pitch. He goes
to village to hunt for hair and finds some on piles of refuse. Next
morning he puts pitch on his head and hair on it. He visits village
again and children recognize him. They notice smell of pitch and take
little sticks, with which they scrape it off his head and chew it. He
gathers up hairs which they had thrown away and returns home. Next day
he goes to timber and finds cactus, juice of which he puts on his head
and pastes hair to juice when nearly dried. He goes again to village and
children again try to remove head covering, but they find it is not
pitch. Towards evening he goes home and then dried juice cracks and
falls off with hair. He tries pitch again and puts it on evening before
dance in village, pasting new hair to it. He sleeps well, but pitch has
become -warm during night and adheres to floor on which he has been
sleeping. He tries to rise, but cannot, and dies of hunger.
