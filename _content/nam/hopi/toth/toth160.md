## 47.--THE CROW AS A SPIRIT OF EVIL.

Crow lives on mesa where sun shrines are located near Oraíbi. He watches
people plant corn in valley and sees who plants com first. When corn
begins to have cars, Crow goes first there. Crow also impersonates
sickness. He influences bad people so that they get sick and some die.
He despoils people in other ways, some beginning to steal. Good people,
Whose heart is not strong

are thus turned into bad people. Some one else tries to counteract
doings of Crow, but Hopi do not know who he is or where he lives. He is
not so strong as Crow. When Hopi are under influence of Crow, other
power makes itself felt by sudden shock.
