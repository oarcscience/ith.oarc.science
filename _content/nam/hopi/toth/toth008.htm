<p>This clan had gone south from the s&iacute;pahpuni. They had with them the &Acirc;'ototo Katcina. They soon found the Young Corn Ear (P&iacute;hk'ash) people with the &Aacute;holi Katcina, who wanted to join them. So the Bear clan chief took them along. They stopped at a place and here had a good crop because they had the two Katcinas with them. The next year they came to a clear stream. In all they stopped ten times before arriving at the Americans, where the sun rises. Here they stopped four years. Their children learned a little English. The land being scarce, the Americans told them to go west and hunt land for themselves, and if anybody would be bad to them (n&uacute;kpana) and cause their children to die, they (the Americans) would come and cut the N&uacute;kapana's heads off. This was told them, because they (the Americans) had been told that down in the old home there had been P&oacute;pwakt&ucirc; (sorcerers, etc.). So they traveled westward, found the Pueblo, but no good land that they could get. So they finally arrived at Shong&oacute;pavi, where some people lived, and there they settled down.</p>  
<p>One time the people saw that the chief, Mach&iacute;to, held a sweet corn-ear between every two fingers, at the same time eating from the other hand. Corn was very scarce at that time, so the people spoke to him about his greediness, at which he got angry and left, taking with him the &Acirc;'ototo and &Aacute;holi. Hunters later found them at a rock, now Bean Spreading Place (B&aacute;hpu-M&ouml;yanpi), where there is still a stone on which there is some writing called Mach&iacute;t&ucirc;t&ucirc;beni. Mach&iacute;to left his wife at Shong&oacute;pavi, also his people, who then formed</p>  
<p><a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="green">p. 29</font></A></p>  
<p>the Shong&oacute;pavi Bear clan. When the hunters found him they informed the people at Shong&oacute;pavi.</p>  
<p>Some went there to get them back, but Mach&iacute;to would not listen to them. Then his wife went to him but he would not listen to her either. So they left him. Mach&iacute;to took a big stone and went with them for some distance to make the landmark between Ora&iacute;bi and Shong&oacute;pavi. The people said several times: "Put it here." But he would not listen until arriving at a place called "Oc&aacute;pchomo," where he placed it, thus making a landmark between the fields of the Shong&oacute;pavi and his own.</p>  
<p>Then Mach&iacute;to and the two Katcinas went up the Ora&iacute;bi mesa where they remained. Later the Spider people arrived. Mach&iacute;to asked about their wanderings and they told him. He wanted to know why the corn would not grow although they had the Flute cult. The Spider clan chief accused the "North Old Man." Mach&iacute;to then said: "All right, you may live here, but as your cult does not seem to be effective, you watch the sun for me, and when he has arrived at his south limit, you tell me, and we shall have the Soy&aacute;l ceremony. Also your p&uuml;'htavi does not seem to have been good, so I want you to make my kind of p&uuml;'htavi."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>After the matter had been settled between Mach&iacute;to and the Spider clan chief, the latter's people came up. Among these were also the Lizard clan, to which the Sand clan is related. These names were given to people while wandering. One would find and see something, perhaps under peculiar circumstances, and he called after it. The Lizard people were also asked what they knew and when they said the Mara&uacute; cult, they were also permitted to stay, but were requested to co-operate in the Soy&aacute;l ceremony. For that reason Pung&ntilde;&aacute;n&ouml;msi, who is of the Bear clan, and village chief, now makes the p&ucirc;hu (road) in the night of the Mara&uacute; ceremony from the n&aacute;tsi at the south end of the kiva towards the rising sun.</p>  
<p>The Rattle-snake (Tc&ucirc;'a) clan also came with the Spider clan to Ora&iacute;bi, but it is not known how or where this clan became a part of the Spider clan, The Badger people understand medicines, hence they prepare the medicine--for instance, charm liquid--for the Flute, Snake, Mara&uacute;, and other ceremonies.</p>  
<p>Another Badger clan and the Butterfly (P&oacute;wul) came from K&iacute;shi-wuu. These brought the Pow&aacute;mu and Katcina cult.</p>  
<p>The Divided Spring (B&aacute;tki) clan came from where the sun rises.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="green">p. 30</font></A></p>  
<p>They came to the village of Ora&iacute;bi and arranged a contest at Muy&iacute;ovatki where each planted corn, the Blue Flutes sweet corn, the others, Wup&aacute;ka&ouml;, over which they played the whole day. The sweet corn grew first, and so the Blue Flutes to this day go to the village in processions, etc., first closing the well (bat&ntilde;i) on the plaza. Later the Drab Flutes (Mas&iacute;t&acirc;lentu) had to throw their meal, mollas, etc., from a distance to the warrior (Kel&eacute;htaka) of the Cakw&aacute;l&acirc;lentu, who put them into the well in the booth for them.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_22"></A><A HREF="toth008.htm#fr_22">29:1</A> It is thought that this refers to the mutual celebrating of the Soy&aacute;l ceremony, in which all are supposed yet to participate. Mach&iacute;to had brought the Soy&aacute;l altar and cult with him. The P&iacute;hk'ash People had &Aacute;holi Katcina and the screen (&Oacute;mawn) now used in the Soy&aacute;l and the corn Ceremonies. The &Acirc;'ototo has the water and rain.</P>
