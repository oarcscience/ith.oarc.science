<p>L&ouml;l&ouml;'okong goes to visit his friend Coyote and is so long he fills kiva. Coyote gives him juniper berries to eat. He invites Coyote to visit him and leaves. Coyote thinks he will pay off his friend and makes artificial tail of cedar bark and yucca leaves, which he fastens to his own tail. He goes to his friend's house and fills whole kiva with his long tail. They eat corn-pollen. They talk together until evening and then Coyote goes home. When his tail is nearly unwound, L&ouml;l&ouml;'okong sets fire to it. Tail sets grass on fire. When tail is nearly consumed, Coyote reaches kiva and begins to think that his friend has so treated him and becomes very angry with L&ouml;l&ouml;'okong .</p>
