<p>Inhabitants of two villages used to lie further northeast, where they were harassed by Utes. For five years they are left in peace. In sixth year their enemies find them out and camp eastward of mesa. Young men are sent to find out who they are. Inhabitants of one village move to the other village, where they can better defend themselves. Enemies go to empty village and follow their tracks on horseback, but they cannot get up. Many of them are shot by people in village. Afterwards by going around mesa they get into village and capture some women and maidens. Warriors follow them, but they escape. People pack up all their things and go in line to Ora&iacute;bi, where they are admitted and still live.</p>  
<p>110.--THE EARLY SPANISH MISSIONS AT ORA&Iacute;BI.</p>  
<p>Long ago Spaniards make inroads on Ora&iacute;bi. They make peace and Spaniards ask to be permitted to live in Ora&iacute;bi. Hopi consent and assist Spaniards in building house. It is in spiral form and in center is house. Meeting house with bell tower is afterwards built, Hopi are baptised by T&ucirc;t&aacute;achi who is joined by another T&ucirc;t&aacute;achi, who brings them clothing and shoes in carts on heavy wooden wheels. Hopi assemble on Sundays and priests speak to them. Soon they ask Hopi to work for them. They send them to springs to get water and they then set them to make cisterns. Spaniards bring cattle and Hopi buy calves for corn. Some cattle drag logs to village. For four years everything goes well and it rains often. Then priests forbid Hopi to have Katcina dances and make b&aacute;hos. It is very warm and very dry. Hopi begin to have ceremonials again and deposit prayer-offerings, but it does not rain. Padres continue to oppress Hopi and demand food. They disregard Hopi's feeling as to their religion and trample under foot chastity of women and maidens. Number of oppressors go away, leaving padre alone. Hopi meet in council and finally decide to get rid of priest. Nobody will go, but finally Badger clan volunteers. They proceed to Mission and knock at door. Padre</p>

<p>refuses to open it at first. When he does so they rush into room, drag him out of house, and cut his throat. They throw his body into gulch and pile stones upon it. They then wait to see what will happen. Other villagers follow example and get rid of their padres. They expect Spaniards will come to revenge brethren, but no one comes and they destroy houses of Spaniards, divide logs and timbers, and use them for kivas. Some of smaller bells still owned by Agave fraternity.</p>  </div>  </BODY>
