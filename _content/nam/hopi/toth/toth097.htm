<p>Hal&iacute;ksai! A long time ago, when people lived in all the seven Hopi villages, and also at Siky&aacute;tki, Red Eagle and his wife lived on the bluff running westward, north of Siky&aacute;tki. He had four children. He lived on a small steep bluff called Kw&aacute;katpe. One time, early in the morning, they had a dance and sang the following song:</p>  
<p>Pu turzh h&ucirc;vam, umuh totim!<br> Now then come here, your youths!<br> Kuywaman ayalalwaahahay.<br> (To) behold send them!<br> Ura conwayningwu<br> Why pretty<br> Kwakatpe palakwayo titooya<br> At Kwakatpe (the) Red Eagle hatches children.<br> Ura vungve tutunglainingwu.<br> Why when grown up (they) are, ask for them.<br> Haooo talti! talti!<br> Ah, it has dawned! It has dawned!<br> Haooo, talti! talti!<br> Ah, it has dawned! It has dawned!<br> Kwa--! (Here they all flew upward a little way and alighted again).</p>  
<p>One of the men from Siky&aacute;tki heard them singing and saw them dance and told his people about it. They soon afterwards went and captured the small Eagles, and forever afterwards they used to get young eagles there, the feathers of which they used for their prayer-offerings, masks, etc.</p>
