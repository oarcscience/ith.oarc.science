<p>Son of Toad Woman goes to village to listen to Snow Katc&iacute;nas practice their singing. He wears robe of wildcat skin, as is customary among young men. On eighth day Toad Woman washes his head with suds. When suit rises, he puts on robe and cap of skin and goes to village. He paints his face. Children laugh at his funny cap. Nobody gives him food, but old man tells children to take him to ant hill. When he has eaten many ants, he goes back to plaza and attends dance all day, enjoying himself. As he leaves village in evening, children follow, having red piki. He asks for some. They give him very little, which he takes to his mother, and she is happy.</p>
