## 68.--THE COYOTE AND THE BLUE JAYS.

Coyote has wife and five children, for whom he hunts rabbits. He chases
little cotton-tail rabbit, which runs into hole which he cannot enter.
Badger comes along and Coyote asks him to get rabbit out for him. Badger
does and Coyote runs home with it. Little Coyotes wrangle over rabbit,
tear it to pieces, some getting nothing and remaining hungry. Next
morning Coyote and wife go in search of food. Wife enters woods and
hears Blue Jays in tree. They

are dancing and ask her to join them. She says she would like to, but
cannot get up there. Blue Jays put some of their wings, tails and
feathers on her legs. She ascends and dances with them. Then they fly
away, Coyote with them, and alight On another tree. This they repeat
three times. They then fly up into air, and when very high they surround
Coyote and tear out all feathers they have loaned him. Coyote falls to
earth and dies. Coyote hunts for his wife, but dogs pursue him and he
goes back to children, who now have no mother. Coyote afterwards hunts
food alone for children, and this is why so many coyotes look out for
food alone.
