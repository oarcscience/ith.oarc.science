## 38.--THE MAIDEN WHO STOLE THE YOUTH'S COSTUME.

Youth wants, to practice running and grandmother dresses him up. She
tells him that on returning to village he is not to pass house of
dangerous maiden. Next day he again runs, and when he ascends to
village, maiden is standing on kiva. She says he is beautifully dressed
up and asks him t let her dress in costume and dance for him. He lays
off costume and hands it to her. She dresses up, dances and sings. At
last words she jumps into through opening, closing it quickly, and tells
him to go. Youth goes home and grandmother is angry, but she says maiden
is hungry for meat and he must go and hunt. After eating he goes hunting
and kills rabbit. Grandmother tells hint to take rabbit and offer it to
maiden if she will dance for him again. He is then to cover opening with
trap door quickly, so that she

cannot get back. Youth goes and maiden dances at edge of kiva opening,
ready to slip in again. She sings and at last word youth throws game
quite distance from kiva. Maiden rushes for it and youth closes opening.
Mána sees he is defeated and lays off entire costume. Youth takes it to
grandmother, who is very happy.
