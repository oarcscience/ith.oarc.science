<p>Maidens are afraid of son of village chief at Ao&aacute;tovi and refuse to marry him. He gets up great hunt and many rabbits are killed. Hawk kills rabbit for chief's son, so chief has much game to carry home. After eating, father smokes on game. Son tells father he is unhappy and suggests they shall do something to people. In morning village chief goes to H&aacute;no, tells chief that maidens refuse to marry his son, and asks him to come and fetch people. He tells him to bring Spanish pepper. H&aacute;no chief informs people of Sitchomovi and W&aacute;lpi, and says they are to get ready for expedition next night. Next evening people of three villages go to Ao&aacute;tovi. Great storm is raging and they ascend mesa. Men are in kivas eating evening meal. Enemies draw ladders from kivas, so that men cannot come out. They gather women and children, and, while some drive them off, others throw firebrands into kivas and destroy men. Captives are taken to villages and distributed.</p>

Those who pass certain rock are not to be molested. Ora&iacute;bi chief tells people that they will make raid on W&aacute;lpi and try to steal maidens.
