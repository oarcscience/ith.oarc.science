<p>It is hot and there is no rain. Beetles are very thirsty and some die, Chief proposes dance to bring rain and makes little song for them. They practice song and go to sleep. In morning chief makes four nakw&aacute;kwosis and deposits them west of little village. He asks clouds in San Francisco Mountains to come quickly and bring some water. They dress up for dance and paint bodies black. Chief prays to clouds and Beetles are formed in line. They sing song and as they are singing clouds come and water falls, so that they can drink. When they have quenched thirst they are very happy and run about.</p>
