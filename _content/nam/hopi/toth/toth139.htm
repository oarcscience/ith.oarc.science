<p>While maiden is dipping out water at spring, B&aacute;l&ouml;l&ouml;okong comes out, and by strong inhalations draws her towards him. He embraces her and disappears with her in water. Mother goes to look for her, and finds her tracks descending to water, and jug is standing there and old blanket. She tells father, who at once makes ball and arrow and takes them to house of P&ouml;'okonghoya  and his brother. They are romping, but their grand mother, Spider Woman, makes them be quiet. She gives man small ball of hur&uacute;shiki, which increases as he eats from it. He gives bows to youths and eagle nakw&aacute;kwosis to Spider Woman, who tells him what to do. He invites friends, and they make many nakw&aacute;kwosis. Next morning Spider Woman and youths go to village, and brother of lost maiden is dressed up. Spider Woman instructs him, and they go to spring. P&ouml;'okongs sing and brother dances. B&aacute;l&ouml;l&ouml;okong comes out holding maiden in left arm. Brother approaches edge of spring and reaches for sister, but he begins to cry, and B&aacute;l&ouml;l&ouml;okong disappears with her. They, try again, and when B&aacute;l&ouml;l&ouml;okong again appears brother grasps maiden and strikes him on head with club. Serpent releases maiden, and only his skin is floating on water like sack. They put other clothes on maiden and lay red feather p&ucirc;'hu on path. They throw tray with nakw&aacute;kwosis into spring for price of maiden, and prayer-offerings that nothing further should befall her. B&aacute;l&ouml;l&ouml;okong still seen there by women, who become sick. He is now small.</p>
