<p>Coyote walking about sees Ch&iacute;ros dancing and singing. He wants to dance and Ch&iacute;ros give him feathers, making him wings and tail and putting small feathers into his body. They dance and sing again, Coyote with them, and then they fly upward very high. Now they crowd around Coyote and take away their feathers. Coyote falls to earth and dies. Ch&iacute;ros laugh at him and are pleased that he is dead.</p>
