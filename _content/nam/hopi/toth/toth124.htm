<p>B&aacute;tki clan and Sand clan come from Pal&aacute;tkwapi. When travelling, Sand clan spreads sand on ground and plants corn. B&aacute;tki clan causes it to thunder and rain and crops grow in day. They find Bear, Parrot, and Crow clans at Mish&oacute;ngnovi, and are asked what they know about producing rain crops. They show their power, and their leader is made chief of village. Spring Tor&iacute;va is very small, but B&aacute;tki-&ntilde;amu puts in it mud, grass, and water from Little Colorado River and flow of water increases. B&aacute;tki is admitted to Antelope and Blue Flute Fraternities of other clans Young Corn-Ear clan comes from Pueblo and brings larger corn.</p>
