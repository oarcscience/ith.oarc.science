<p>Badger and small Gray Mice are Hopi, but were very bad and became animals. They are rival doctors, Badger curing by herbs and Gray Mice by sorcery. Badger doubts whether Mouse knows anything about diseases and decides to try him. He fasts four days and when he becomes very weak sends for Mouse. Mouse brings rattle, medicines, and medicine bowl, in which he makes mixture. He places it beside Badger's couch and sings song about Badger fasting. He tells him to eat and he will get well. Badger is astonished and thinks Mouse great doctor.</p>
