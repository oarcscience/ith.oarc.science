<p>P&ouml;ok&oacute;nghoya and little brother Bal&ouml;'ngahoya hear of two beautiful maidens, and go to visit them. Maidens think they have gone to marry them, and say they may own them if they will each have arm cut off. They consent, and maidens cut off right arm of young brother and then of elder brother with upper mealing stone. They carry severed arms home and tell grandmother how mischief happened.

P&ouml;ok&oacute;nghoya wants</p>
