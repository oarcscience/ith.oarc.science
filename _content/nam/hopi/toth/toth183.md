## 70.--THE COYOTE AND THE RED EAGLE.

On Coyote's returning from hunt one hot day, he finds his children very
thirsty. They are still very young. He goes to Toríva for water, which
he gets in his mouth. On returning he sees Eagle dancing on one leg.
Coyote laughs and spills water. He runs back to spring and again fills
mouth with water, which he again spills through laughing at dancing
Eagle. He is angry and goes to cedar timber to get some pitch. He goes
again to Toríva and, after drinking, fills his mouth and pastes it up
with pitch. He again sees Eagle dancing and again laughs, but he does
not spill water. He finds his children sleeping nicely and pours water
into their mouths, but they do not awaken. They are dead. He is angry
and goes to kill Eagle, who flies away, and shows that he has two legs.
