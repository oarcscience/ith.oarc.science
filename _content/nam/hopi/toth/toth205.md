## 93.--THE CROW AND THE HAWK.

Crow and Hawk, while hunting, meet, and Crow invites Hawk to visit him.
Hawk takes, rabbits for his children and thinks of good food Crow has
promised to prepare. In morning Hawk goes over to friend who is cooking
lölö'okong cut into pieces. It is fat and smells strong. Hawk does not
relish it and only pretends to eat. They converse long time about
hunting. Crow has many lizards, etc., which fill his house with odor,
and Hawk does not enjoy his stay. On returning home he invites Crow to
visit him next day and, promises him good food. Crow thinks about good
food it is to have and goes to friend's house in morning. Hawk cooks
only skins and intestines of rabbits, which he sets before Crow. Crow
relishes food very much, though Hawk thought he would not eat any of it.
They talk all day together and in evening Crow returns home.
