## 99.--WHY THE ANTS ARE SO THIN.

Chief of Ants says that in four days they are going to have Katcina
initiation. On fourth day three ants dress up as Katcinas. Some make
sand picture in kiva and Ants bring in children to be initiated. Katcina
priest relates story and four little Kóyemsis have performance. At
signal Katcinas come running and after circling kiva several times,
enter it. They flog little Ant children so hard that they almost cut
through middle of body. When through, all Katcinas run away. That is why
ants are now so thin in middle of bodies.
