## 43. BIG HEAD AND GOAT HORN. <span id="fr_105"></span>[1](toth047.htm#fn_103)

Halíksai! In Oraíbi they were living. East of the Kwan kiva a youth
lived, by the name of Big Head (Wuyákqötö), Away south are the Hopi
Buttes, and on the westernmost butte lived Goat Horn (Chiwákala). These
two were friends, but as they lived so far apart they did not visit each
other often; but one time Goat Horn visited his friend in Oraíbi. After
they had eaten and talked together, towards evening Goat Horn wanted to
return home. "My friend," he said to Big Head. "What is it?" the latter
replied. "You must come and visit me sometime, too," Goat Horn said;
whereupon he went home. After a while Big Head visited his friend, and
stayed all night there. In the morning Goat Horn killed a goat for his
friend, cut it in two, and gave him one-half, which Big Head took with
him to the village; and that is the reason why Hopi, when they kill a
goat, cut it up.
