## 8.--THE WANDERINGS OF THE BEAR CLAN.

On leaving sipahpuvi, Bear people separate and go ahead of others. They
stay for various periods at different places, and finally come to Little
Colorado River. Here they assume clan name. They see dead bear from
which they take name. Another party takes skin of bear, from which they
cut carrying straps, and is called Piqö'sha; another party is called
Mû'yi, after mice which ate hair front bear's hide. These three parties
are closely related. Another party comes, and is called after the
Blue-birds that ate bear's body, and another that finds it full of
spider-web is called Spider. Sixth party takes skull as drinking vessel,
and is called jug clan, and seventh party becomes Ant clan, as they find
place swarming with ants. These seven clans are thus considered as
related. From Little Colorado River Bear clan moves eastward, finally to
Matö'ví, where they remain considerable time. Then they move northward
to site of Shongópavi, where they are first to arrive. They bring Blue
Flute cult, by which they make crops grow quickly, and various Katcinas.
