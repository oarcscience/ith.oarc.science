## 79.--THE COYOTE AND THE GRASSHOPPER.

Grasshopper and Coyote are great friends. Grasshopper has children and
big field. At planting time he tells wife others are going too help him
and she is to put up good deal of food. She prepares food and jug of
water. These, with seeds, Grasshopper takes on back and goes to field.
He waits in kísi he has built until nearly noon, but nobody comes. Then
he eats food and goes to field and plants all alone. Afternoon is very
hot. He returns to kísi, drinks, and lays down to rest, leaning feet
against side. Coyote comes and asks why he is lying that way.
Grasshopper says he is tired and he is afraid kísi will fall on him.
Coyote lays down beside friend, also leaning his hind feet against
booth. Grasshopper Jumps up and says he will get more water. He picks up
jug and goes home, and, as he is planning mischief against his friend,
he tells children to go to their uncle Deer. Coyote waits until he is
tired. He jumps up without booth falling. Says Grasshopper has lied and
that he will go and eat up his children. He goes to house of friend and
finds it closed. He follows tracks to house of Deer and asks if
grasshopper has come with his family. He wants Deer to get them out, but
Deer tells Coyote to come in himself. He hesitates, but at last goes
down ladder and sees two strong Deer standing. As he steps down into
deeper portion of kiva, one Deer picks him up with horns and throws him
towards hatchway. As he falls, other Deer does same, and so they keep it
up until he is dead. Grasshoppers then go and scatter over country.
