## 64.--THE COYOTE AND THE HUMMING-BIRD.

Coyote and Humming-bird both have children and are good friends. Coyote
goes to place where is refuse of village to look for pieces of skin, and
bird goes to place close by and buries himself, his bill only
protruding. Coyote comes and thinks bill is needle and pulls at it. Bird
says it is his bill and laughs at Coyote. They go to bird's house and
converse. In evening Coyote goes home, inviting bird to visit him
to-morrow. Next morning bird goes to Coyote's house, first hunting
worms. Near house she sees something protruding from ground and thinks
it is gourd jug. She pulls at it and Coyote says it is his snout. Coyote
feeds friend on juniper berries, Coyote eating some. After talking
awhile bird returns home.
