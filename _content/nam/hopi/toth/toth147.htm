<p>K&oacute;honino goes hunting. Shoots mountain sheep and follows it all day. Shoots it again, and animal tumbles partly down bluff and dies. Hunter climbs down, but foot slips, and he rolls over ledge where animal lying. Both his eyes fall out, and he lies unconscious. K&oacute;honino in village keep up fire all night and wait for return of young man. In night he revives, but as Skeleton. He goes to village, pitying himself. People see and hear him. They see skeleton, and all flee with things and children. Skeleton takes possession of houses, and has lived there ever since. K&oacute;honino go westward, and settle in valley near Green Bluff.</p>
