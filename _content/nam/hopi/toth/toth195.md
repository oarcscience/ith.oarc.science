## 82.--THE COYOTE AND HIS PREY.

Coyote has children somewhere. He hunts for food and kills rabbit. He
does not want to eat alone, and calls it out from bluff. From different
quarters come different colored Coyotes, and he tells them they will eat
together. They tear rabbit to pieces and devour it quickly. That is why
Coyote never eats prey alone.
