<p>Hal&iacute;ksai! At H&ucirc;'kovi they were living, and at Piv&aacute;nhonk'api they were also living. At both places there were a great many children, and they always went down to Mum&uacute;shva (a spring named after a certain herb and grass that grows in the spring), where they were setting bird traps. They were often at enmity with one another on account of the birds. One morning they again went to trap birds. They again became very angry at one another on account of the trapping, and the H&ucirc;'kovi children said to the children of Piv&aacute;nhonk'api that they should not trap birds there. But they said if they would give them something they could trap birds there. So the children from Piv&aacute;nhonk'api ran back to the village and got such things as k&ucirc;t&ucirc;'ki, p&iacute;ki, and different other articles of food, and gave them to the children of H&ucirc;'kovi, so that the latter carried home a great deal of food which they had purchased for the permission given to the Piv&aacute;nhonkapi children to catch birds there, and after that the children from both villages were always catching birds there, and maybe they are catching birds there still.</p>
