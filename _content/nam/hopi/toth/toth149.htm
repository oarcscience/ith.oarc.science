Next day old man who sits near him tells him to wait until others have done. He does so, and he goes to grandmother's house and brings great many watermelons. He goes again and brings great deal of meat. He and old man eat together, and when done others come and take what is left. One man does not come, and then says they will bring their wealth to-morrow, and whoever is richest shall live with young man's wife. Next day they go for their possessions and fill kiva. Then Piw&iacute;tamni goes to grandmother's house, and she gives him great many sashes. He returns and grandmother gives him buckskins in great quantities. Next time she gives him bundle of large buckskins, so that he is very rich. Old man takes all Piw&iacute;tamni's things to his wife, Men want another test, and next day go around -village and examine corn piles, They find Piw&iacute;tamni's house filled with corn, watermelons, and squashes, so he is ahead of them, and no one dares to take his wife from him.
