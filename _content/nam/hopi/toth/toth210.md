## 98.--HOW THE BEETLES PRODUCED RAIN.

It is hot and there is no rain. Beetles are very thirsty and some die,
Chief proposes dance to bring rain and makes little song for them. They
practice song and go to sleep. In morning chief makes four nakwákwosis
and deposits them west of little village. He asks clouds in San
Francisco Mountains to come quickly and bring some water. They dress up
for dance and paint bodies black. Chief prays to clouds and Beetles are
formed in line. They sing song and as they are singing clouds come and
water falls, so that they can drink. When they have quenched thirst they
are very happy and run about.
