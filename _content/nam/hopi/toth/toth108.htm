HOW AN ORA&Iacute;BI CHIEF PUNISHED HIS PEOPLE.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_194"></A><A HREF="#fn_192"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></h2>  
<p>A long time ago the people were living in Ora&iacute;bi. They were also living in W&aacute;lpi which, however, then was not on top of the mesa, but somewhat farther down towards the north-west. One time the children (people) of the chief in Ora&iacute;bi were very bad and the chief concluded that he would punish them. So he went over to the warrior chief in W&aacute;lpi. He sat down and they first smoked, then the warrior chief asked him what his object in coming was. "Yes," he said, "my children are very bad and I have come to see what you think about it. After some days we will come by here to attack W&aacute;lpi. You must then be ready and come to meet us in the valley, and when my children return and run, you must kill them, but those who pass the rock that is standing south of Pon&oacute;toika, they shall remain unmolested.</p>  
<p>The warrior chief of W&aacute;lpi agreed to this, on the condition that the Ora&iacute;bi chiefs would not ask for any of the lives of the W&aacute;lpi. To this he agreed. So the Ora&iacute;bi chief returned and told his people that in four days they would make a raid on W&aacute;lpi and try especially to steal some maidens. They were willing, and so during the night after the third day proceeded towards W&aacute;lpi. Early in the morning they approached the village, hut the W&aacute;lpi were ready. They descended from their village well armed, and, sounding the war yell, rushed upon the Ora&iacute;bi.</p>  
<p>One of the W&aacute;lpi young men had a very large, fierce dog. This dog rushed ahead and bit a great many of the Ora&iacute;bi in the leg, thus</p>

<p>disabling them. The Ora&iacute;bi had been so thoroughly surprised that they got frightened and fled when the W&aacute;lpi rushed upon them. The latter now chased the fleeing Ora&iacute;bi and killed a great many. The big dog also disabled and killed a number of them. Only a few passed the rock mentioned above. On account of this battle, in which that dog killed so many Ora&iacute;bi, a dog is engraved on that rock and it is called the dog mark (P&oacute;kv&acirc;ita).</p>  
<p>This is the way chiefs often punished their children (people) when they became "bewitched." That is one reason why there are so very many ruins all over the country. Many people were killed in that way because their chiefs became angry and invited some chief or inhabitant from other villages to destroy their people.</p>
