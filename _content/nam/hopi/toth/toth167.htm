<p>Man from W&aacute;lpi goes to attend dance at Shong&oacute;pavi. He sees children hunting lizards and shooting arrows at them. Proceeding, he hears voice and sees little lizards sitting and making peculiar sounds. He watches them running around and playing with each other. Man has lost so much time he returns and relates that he has not seen dance, but has watched children hunting and singing song, which is forever afterwards called Mish&oacute;ngnovi Song.</p>
