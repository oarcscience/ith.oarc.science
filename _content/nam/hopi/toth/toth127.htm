He rushes into kiva where women are making trays for Lag&oacute;n ceremony. Woman seats him in her lap and hides him under tray. Skeleton arrives and drives women about. Man rushes out and runs to Shong&oacute;pavi, where same thing takes place. From here he runs to Mat&ouml;'vi where Flute Society has ceremony. They tell him to go into spring and hide in top of sunflower stalk. When Skeleton comes, Flute priest tells her husband has gone into spring. She enters and sees sunflower stalk reflected in water and her husband on top of it. Thinking he is in water, she dives in and disappears, Man comes down and joins Flute players. On fourth day woman comes out of water dressed in bridal costume. Priests call two together and place them back to back. They make roads with sacred meal, one south and other north, and tell them to proceed four steps and then turn and meet again. Man returns when he has taken three steps. Priests call on woman to run. She starts and husband after her. They are still running and are two stars.</p>
