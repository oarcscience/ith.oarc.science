## 90.--THE MICE, THE OWL, AND THE HAWK.

Owl determines to kill Mouse and flies about hole. Mole places pointed
sticks around hole. Owl in trying to catch Mouse is pierced by stick and
is killed. Mouse pulls out all Owl's feathers and ties them into little
bunches. He calls neighbors and distributes feathers, which they tie on
their heads. They decide to have dance and request one to make song.
They thrust more sticks into ground in case more Owls should be around
while dancing. They put up large feathers in center of inclosure as
tiponi around which to dance. Leader has little bow with tiny arrows.
While dance is going on Hawk swoops down and kills many Mice. Others
rush into their house.

92.--THE SPARROW HAWK AND THE HÂKWÂ.

Sparrow Hawk catches many lizards, but does not attempt to catch Hâkwâ.
Hâkwâ thinks Sparrow Hawk is afraid and sings taunting song. Sparrow
Hawk is irritated and tells Hâkwâ he does not want to kill him, he is
too dirty. Hâkwâ repeats his song four times. Hawk determines to kill
Hâkwâ and takes little Hawk- to stone where he had sat and flies away.
Hâkwâ again comes out and mistaking young Sparrow Hawk for old one,
begins song again. Sparrow Hawk has made large circuit and swoops down
on Hâkwâ, kills him, and carries him home. Hâkwâ is very fat, and
Sparrow Hawk and brood live on him until latter can leave nest.
