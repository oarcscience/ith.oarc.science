<p>Crow lives on mesa where sun shrines are located near Ora&iacute;bi. He watches people plant corn in valley and sees who plants com first. When corn begins to have cars, Crow goes first there. Crow also impersonates sickness. He influences bad people so that they get sick and some die. He despoils people in other ways, some beginning to steal. Good people, Whose heart is not strong</p>

<p>are thus turned into bad people. Some one else tries to counteract doings of Crow, but Hopi do not know who he is or where he lives. He is not so strong as Crow. When Hopi are under influence of Crow, other power makes itself felt by sudden shock.</p>
