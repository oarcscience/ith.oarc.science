<p>After coming from under-world, people remain with Skeleton some time. When they travel eastward large party comes to Pal&aacute;tkwapi. Among them is Divided Water clan. Old man belonging to this clan is shamefully mistreated, and he reports to village and other chiefs, complaining of young men. Village chief says they will move away. He tells son to run to Pine Ridge. They are sorcerers. On his return, chief makes four masks which his son puts on, the last being like that of Skeleton. He has fingers cut from old corpses tied to</p>

<p>wrists as rattler. Chief gives young man long cedar bark fuse and tells him to return to Pine Ridge and set pine on fire. He does so, and on return grinds corn on sister's mealing stone. He now acts as ghost and again goes and sets other timbers on fire. This he does several nights, and watchers are set to catch him. On fourth night he is caught and put into kiva. People assemble, and village chief requests some one to take masks off ghost. Man does so, and they see ghost is chief's son. He tells them to plant b&aacute;hos in five places and to have four days' feast, and leaves kiva. They have feast and are much relieved when nothing happens. In fourth year afterwards old man who had before complained of young men makes many b&aacute;hos of hard wood. He makes points very sharp. Village chief sends crier chief to announce four days' feast. People are mistrustful and do not prepare feast. Night following old man tells chiefs to dress him up and put him in katcina shrine on plaza. When all are asleep they dig hole in shrine that will admit man. They place in his arms all his b&aacute;hos, with B&aacute;l&ouml;l&ouml;okong whistle and little bowl of water to whistle into. They destroy appearance of opening. Then they sing sorcerers' songs. Old man ejects rumbling sounds and says he has been successful. They leave old man who thrusts part of hand through opening. When this is noticed he sings and lowers little finger. Next morning he sings again and lowers next finger, and so on three days. Then water begins to come out where b&aacute;hos had been planted four years previously. They suspect flood is coming and they have great feast. On fourth day old man in grave sings and lowers fourth finger. Immediately he emerges as large B&aacute;l&ouml;l&ouml;okong, and B&aacute;l&ouml;l&ouml;okongs shoot forth from ground with streams of water in all parts of village. Houses fall and bury many persons. Others fly to large house on high ground. In one house old men climb on tray shelves and turn into turkeys. Chiefs meet in council and make b&aacute;hos, crush beads and turquoise into powder, of which they make two balls. They then call son of village chief and his sister and dress them up. They are to drive back B&aacute;l&ouml;l&ouml;okongs which are shooting swiftly through water. Old man B&aacute;l&ouml;l&ouml;okong is still standing where he emerged. Young men takes some b&aacute;hos, and m&aacute;na tray containing two balls and other b&aacute;hos and they wade into waters. Young man grasps large B&aacute;l&ouml;l&ouml;okong and presses him into water. Serpent, with young man and sister, disappear and never return. Everything is destroyed in village. Only old men turkeys survive, and two little boys who had been sleeping during flood and were not drowned. Surviving people make food altar and leave village, leaving two children. Turkey takes pity on children and sends them to food altar to eat. Big B&aacute;l&ouml;l&ouml;okong comes and looks after people. He sees children and says he is their grandfather. Tells them where to get food and to find knife. Says they are to follow parents. Makes them cut piece of flesh out of his back, and says if little of meat is rubbed among paint for b&aacute;hos it will rain. Children start, and on third day are exhausted, and fall asleep. God of Thunder descends to help them. They are frightened until he removes his mask. He gives them food. Third day he returns and promises them lightning and thunder with which to kill their enemies and teaches them war songs and how warrior who brings home scalp is to act. In morning he tells children to follow people, and that they are to pray to him. They go and finally find mother, who thought they had perished. They tell about piece of flesh. B&aacute;tki people use it with paint and heavy rains come. Children become bad, and when grown up they start off to kill some one. They pray to God of Thunder, who comes and teaches them how to kill</p>

<p>Apache who are near. In morning they go and are surrounded by Apache. After arrow shooting for some time elder brother shoots lightning and all Apache are slain. They scalp large and fierce warrior, and cut out his heart and, taking moccasins and costumes of slain, return. God of Thunder comes and tells them to throw scalp on man who is to be War Chief. They return home and are discharmed. Scalp is thrown and War Chief made. People leave Hom&oacute;lovi, and after wandering some time B&aacute;tki clan goes to Ao&aacute;tovi, and others, who become Forehead Clan, arrive near Shong&oacute;pavi, and finally settle in Shupa&uacute;lavi. Chief of Shong&oacute;pavi informs Spaniards in New Mexico that inhabitants of Shupa&uacute;lavi wish to be taken away. Spaniards come to Keams Canyon. Chief of W&aacute;lpi informs chief of Shupa&uacute;lavi and they go together to see leader of Spaniards. They satisfy leader that he has been deceived, and after trading for clothes they have brought, Spaniards return. They never encroach on Hopi again, but people at Shupa&uacute;lavi are scared by false news that Spaniards are coming, and many move to Shong&oacute;pavi.</p>
