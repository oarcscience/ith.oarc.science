Prettiest maiden has become large snake, which is very angry. Snake Woman gives young man medicine, some of which he chews and spurts on fierce snake. It becomes docile, and he grabs snake and strokes it four times. Chief tells him to look away again, and snakes assume human form again. They now talk to young man, and they consider him initiated. M&aacute;na whom he captured lays food before him. Chief asks why he came, and he speaks of running water and that he wants beads from Hur&uacute;ing Wuhti, Young man makes excuse and takes Spider Woman home. On return to kiva chief instructs him about Snake cult. Next morning he goes to Spider Woman, who makes rainbow road to bluff, where Hur&uacute;ing Wuhti lives. They find old hag, but many beads, shells, etc., on walls. At sundown she becomes pretty maiden and invites young man to sleep with her. In morning he finds old hag, who in evening again changes to maiden, and remains so. He remains four days and nights with Hur&uacute;ing Wuhti, who is deity of hard substances. She gives him beads and charges him not to open sack as he goes home. If he does they will be gone; if not they will increase. Young man returns to Snake kiva, where he stays four days and nights. Chief tells him to take m&aacute;na who will bear him children, and they will hold ceremony. They start and go to Spider Woman's house. He tells voting man not to touch his wife on way home, or she and beads will disappear. On way they sleep separately and beads increase. When nearly one more day's travel, sack has become full and man opens it, while wife remonstrates. During night he takes out finest beads and shells and puts them around his neck. In morning all beads but those given him by Hur&uacute;ing Wuhti have disappeared. They come to village, and soon woman bears many Snake children.
