## 59.--THE WATER SERPENT AND THE COYOTE.

Water Serpent and Coyote are great friends. Water Serpent is still
young, but he is so long that when he visits Coyote and coils up he
fills kiva. He invites Coyote to visit him. Coyote meditates how he can
fill kiva of Water Serpent and tells him tail will become long. He gets
large bundle of cedar bark, makes bark pliable and wraps it with yucca
leaves. He then pulls out wool and pastes it to cedar bark, so that it
looks like tail. He then fastens false tail to his own. In morning he
goes to Water Serpent's kiva, which is well filled with his tail. When
he leaves he asks Snake to visit him again. When he comes to his kiva he
unfastens tail. He puts it on again when he sees friend coming. Snake
arrives and has grown so much he cannot get into kiva with Coyote's
tail. Coyote goes out and sits near kiva opening conversing with Snake
inside. Coyote becomes very cold and angry with Snake for staying so
long. He determines to get even with friend and makes another long
addition to tail. On very cold day he goes again to visit his friend. He
enters kiva and fills entire kiva with tail. Snake goes outside and
becomes very cold and then very angry Coyote stays so long. Finally
Coyote says he must go, and while he is dragging his tail after him
up-ladder Snake goes in and shoves end of Coyote's tail into fire. When
Coyote is near his kiva he looks around and sees smoke and fire. He
thinks Hopi have set grass on fire to drive him away. He runs away and
reaches timber, but, seeing this burning after awhile, he runs to Little
Colorado River and jumps in. He is drowned.
