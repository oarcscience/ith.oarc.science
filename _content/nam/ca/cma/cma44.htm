<p>IT is noteworthy that in Indian myths whenever two sisters are sent somewhere, as in the present case, and warned by father or mother against some deceiver who is likely to meet them on the way, the elder sister is generally ready to become a victim, the younger is the wise and obedient one, as in this myth.</p>  
<p>We have again a case of putting on the skin of a slain person to become like him or her.</p>  
<p>The test of bringing water was perfect, since no one who was not of the household could know where it was.</p>
