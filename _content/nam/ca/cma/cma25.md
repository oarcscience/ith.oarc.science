*Creation Myths of Primitive America*, by Jeremiah Curtin, \[1898\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

THE following notes are put in as condensed a form as possible. They are
confined to explanations of the actors or characters in the myths, and
to information concerning the meaning of names of persons and places.

The myths from one to nine inclusive are Wintu, from ten to the end
Yana. These two nations, though neighbors, are not related; their
languages are radically different.

# NOTES

In 1895 I made a journey to California in consequence of an arrangement
with the late Charles A. Dana, editor of "The Sun." According to this
arrangement, Mr. Dana was to publish on consecutive Sundays such
myth-tales as I might think of sufficient value to appear in his paper.
Those myths were to be found by me in California, Mexico, and Guatemala.

I began at the source of the Sacramento River, and worked down to the
mouth, my last stopping-place being the extensive hop-fields in the
lower valley.

In San Francisco I wrote the following short account of the Wintus. That
done, I set out for Mexico.

In the city of Guadalajara I copied the myths obtained in California and
sent them to "The Sun." After that I worked at "Quo Vadis," the greater
part of which I translated in Guadalajara.

All the myths in this volume were published in "The Sun," and appeared
as a part of a series pertaining to Indians in California, Mexico, and
Guatemala.

Only the California part has been published thus far.

After leaving Guadalajara I spent almost a year in Guatemala and
Chiapas, the southernmost state of Mexico. Among the last places which I
visited was Palenque. A view of one part of the ruins of this remarkable
and mysterious city appears as a frontispiece to the present volume.
