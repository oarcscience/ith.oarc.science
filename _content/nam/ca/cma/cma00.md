### DEDICATION

*To*

MAJOR J. W. POWELL,

*Director of the Bureau of Ethnology, Smithsonian Institution, LL.D. of
Harvard and Heidelberg*:

SIR,--YOU lost your right hand in fighting to save American unity; but
though the hand went from you its cunning remained, with the power to
plan and to execute.

The same kind of impulse that sent you to the field of battle to serve
the country and the world, sent you to the field of science to serve as
a geologist and an explorer in the majestic region of the Colorado, and
finally brought you to found the Bureau of Ethnology. Through your
labors, combined with those of the men whom you have associated with
you, the world has learned more of the great primitive race of our
country than it learned from the discovery of the continent till the day
when the Bureau was founded.

I beg to inscribe this book to you as a mark of my respect and
friendship.

JEREMIAH CURTIN.

    STEAMER "GERMANIC,"  
ON THE MID-ATLANTIC OCEAN  
       *October* 21, 1898.
