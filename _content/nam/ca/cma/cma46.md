[HAKA](errata.htm#5) KAINA

HERE we find another myth of a flint people.

In the Hakas and Tennas we have a struggle between the lightning and the
clouds. In Haka Kaina the myth represents the advance of spring to
colder regions. The swan-maidens go north with the early lightning of
the year. Hence Haka Kaina, the war chief of Wahkalu, the great
residence of Jupka, is represented as stealing them. In another myth, of
which, unfortunately, I have only a fragment, these same swan-maidens
are borne away north by Haka Kaina with great pomp and circumstance. The
chief is attended by an immense escort, in which all the personages are
phenomena of springtime. His regular force, his trusty warriors do not
migrate; they stay all the year at Wahkalu, unless when absent on some
expedition. The most characteristic person in the escort is a species of
poplar-tree, the leaves of which tremble like those of an aspen. This
hero dances all the time from his point of starting in the south till he
reaches Mount Shasta. This gives a fine picture of that kind of tree
putting forth leaves which quiver with gladness at the approach of the
swan-maidens.

The marshalling by Haka Kaina of forces so numerous that they surround
the immense base of Mount Shasta, the enormous dust

which they raise, dust which goes up to the sun, their death by fire at
the hands of the Mini Aunas, their resurrection and return home with the
swan-maidens and all the spoils of Hwipajusi's people, are conceived on
a scale truly grand.
