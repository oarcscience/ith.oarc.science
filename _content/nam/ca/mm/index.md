The author of this book, John Steven McGroarty (1862-1944) was poet
laureate of California, an author, journalist, dramatist, and unabashed
booster for the preservation and celebration of the California Missions.
He also served in Congress from 1935 to 1938. His drama, The Mission
Play, a three hour pageant spanning the entire history of the California
Missions, ran for twenty years at mission San Gabriel.

The real strength of this book is the illustrations. There is one major
drawing for each of the twenty one missions, plus [a map showing their
locations](mm24). I'm not so thrilled about the introduction, which
trivializes the native people and presents Mission life as utopian. My
policy is to leave these texts intact as a witness to the historical
context in which they were written. That said, it should be noted that
when McGoarty got to Congress, he sponsored legislation to abolish the
Bureau of Indian Affairs, angered over the treatment of Native
Americans. So he wasn't exactly blind to the realities of the situation,
nor unsympathetic.

The Missions had a dark side, none of which is hinted at in this book.
The native Californians had lived a sustainable, rich life for thousands
of years. They were herded into the Missions, stripped of their cultures
and languages, and worked into exhaustion. The Missions, European
diseases, and eventually the arrival of the Americans decimated the
Native Californian population.
