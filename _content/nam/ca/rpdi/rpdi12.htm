<p>A distinctive mortuary ceremony is performed after the death of each toloache initiate. Among the Diegue&ntilde;o it is called "otcam", and seems to coincide with the unish matakish ceremony of the Luise&ntilde;o.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">79</FONT></A> It is said by the Diegue&ntilde;o to take place</p>

<p>on the afternoon preceding the Clothes-Burning ceremony just discussed. Some time about the middle of the afternoon one of the old men swings the bull-roarer, ai<span class="it">r</span>, three times. This is the signal for the people to assemble. Some especially practiced man then performs the Whirling dance. This corresponds to the Luise&ntilde;o Morahash dance,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_85"></A><A HREF="#fn_85"><FONT SIZE="1">80</FONT></A> called at the present time the "Tatahuila." It includes a great deal of whirling, and a man who is not used to it becomes dizzy and falls down. This dance has been observed a number of times by the writer. It is also performed in connection with another mourning ceremony known as the Eagle dance.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_85"></A><A HREF="rpdi12.htm#fr_85">308:80</A> <i>Ibid</i>., p. 185. Etymologically, the word is compounded of the root <i>mor</i>, to whirl, plus a connecting vowel <i>a</i> which indicates that the root is to be taken in a passive or middle sense, plus a suffix <i>hash</i> which means "the doing something for someone else." The Luise&ntilde;o name implies, therefore, <i>the whirling that is performed in behalf of someone else</i>. This is particularly in harmony with what has been elsewhere written concerning the Tatahuila.</P>
