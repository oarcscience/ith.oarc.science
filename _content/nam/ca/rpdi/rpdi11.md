### THE CLOTHES-BURNING CEREMONY.

At the appointed time word is sent to the neighboring villages and
families, and a large assembly drawn together. According to invariable
custom, both for this and kindred ceremonies, the head of the family
passes over the management of everything to a friend or visitor. Both he
and his family carefully refrain from even tasting any of the food
gathered for the festival.

The first night is passed by the relatives of the deceased in wailing.
On the following night a great fire is built and all the people, men and
women, dance around it, circling alternately in each direction. The man
who has charge of proceedings, assisted by one or two others, carries
the dead person's clothes. The songs sung at this time are the regular
songs of the Fire dance. <span id="fr_81"></span>[76](#fn_81) At the
close of each song all the dancers together make

the deep grunting sound: "mwau—u," and motion upward in the air. At the
completion of three or four songs, all pause and face toward the fire,
repeating the grunting sound three times. Then the sound is repeated
once more, and all the clothes are thrown at the same time on the fire.
While the garments, together with numerous baskets and other property,
burn, they sing this song:

<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>

<td data-valign="top" width="327"><p><span class="small">now dead I-begin-to-sing <span id="fr_82"></span><a href="#fn_82">77</a><br />
now dead I-begin-to-sing<br />
North, South, East, West<br />
up, down</span></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

Following this they dance several times around the fire, singing Fire
songs, then throw on more clothes and sing:

<div align="center">

<table data-border="0">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td data-valign="top" width="327"><p><span class="small">mawi-a! mawi-a!<br />
moyo-o! mawi-a!</span></p></td>
<td data-valign="top" width="327"><p><span class="small">what-fore ah! what-for? ah!<br />
you-dead, oh! what-for? ah!</span></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

Anyone of the strangers who wants a little money takes a long stick and
turns over the clothes so they will burn better. The relatives of the
dead person then come around and give him small jars, baskets, and other
"little things."

When the clothes are completely burned they sing as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">apamsi penoxi inyoxo</span>

</div>

The rites are completed by dancing the fire out, singing meanwhile the
songs which belong to that ceremony. <span

see below.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[307:77](rpdi11.htm#fr_82) Part of the myth
which tells of the origin of the ceremony is as follows: "The first man
who performed the ceremony reached his hand to the North and brought a
red rock, from the East a gleaming white rock, from the South a green
rock, and from the West a black rock because the sun sets there. Then he
blew in all four directions and sang, 'My father and grandfather are
dead, so now I sing.'" The remainder of the narrative concerning the
origin of the ceremony could not be obtained.

account of the Fire ceremony. The Luiseño Clothes-Burning is described
in present series, VIII, 180, 226.
