<p><i>The Olayome of Putah Creek say</i>:</p>  
<p><i>Hoo-yu'-mah</i> the Meadowlark understands and speaks our language. He often makes disagreeable remarks; we often hear him say, "I see you are angry," and other mean things.</p>  
<p>NOTE. In the Ancient Myths it has already been shown that the Northern <i>Me'-wuk</i> and <i>Wi'-p&#257;</i> tribes of Mewan stock, and the <i>P&#257;'-we-nan</i> tribe of Midoo stock, hold the Meadowlark responsible for the failure of dead people to rise on the third or fourth day and come to life again (see pages</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> <A HREF="dow11.htm#page_55">55</A>-56 and <A HREF="dow25.htm#page_132">132</A>). This belief is widespread among the Mewan tribes and is held also by at least one Pomo tribe-the `Ham'-fo or Koi'-im-fo of Clear Lake.</p>  
<p>All the Mewan tribes, and many belonging to widely different stocks--including even the Washoo of Lake Tahoe and adjacent valleys east of the Sierra--class the Meadowlark among the bad birds. They say he talks too much and is a gossip and they do not like him. The Washoo call him <i>Se-soo'-te'-al-le</i> and, like several other tribes, insist that he talks to them in their own language and always makes uncomplimentary remarks. He tells them that he sees right through them; that they are stingy and provide only food enough for themselves; that they are dark on the outside only and under the skin are as white and mean as a white man, and so on.</p>  
<p><i>The Mariposa Mewuk say</i>:</p>  
<p>If a person breaks a Meadowlark's egg it will rain.</p>
