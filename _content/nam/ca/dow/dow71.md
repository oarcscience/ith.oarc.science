# THE ROCK GIANTS

### CHE-HA-LUM'-CHE THE ROCK GIANT OF CALAVERAS COUNTY

*The Northern Mewuk say*:

*Che-ha-lum'-che* the Rock Giant carries on his back a big burden basket
(*che'-ka-la*) which, like himself, is of rock. He lives in caves, of
which there are two near Mountain Ranch or El Dorado in Calaveras
County, one at Murphys, and one on Stanislaus River.

*Che-ha-lum'-che* comes out only at night and wanders about seeking
*Mewuk* \[people\] to eat. He prefers women; of these he catches and
carries off all he can find. Sometimes he makes a crying noise,
*hoo-oo'-oo* like a baby, to lure them. If they come he seizes them and
tosses them into his big pack basket and carries them to his cave, where
he eats them. In the basket is a long spike which pierces their bodies
when they are thrown in, so they can not escape.

In his caves are the remains of his victims--horns of deer and bones of
people and different kinds of animals.

Indians never throw their dead into caves. If they did,
*Che-ha-lum'-che* would get them. Any

man who would put a dead person in a cave would be killed by the other
Indians. <span id="fr_28"></span>[30](#fn_28)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_28"></span>[232:30](dow71.htm#fr_28) Many human skulls and
skeletons have been found in eaves along the west slope of the middle
Sierra. The presence of human remains in these caves has been
interpreted to mean that the Indians now living in the region practise
cave burial, or did practise it until recent times. This is an error.
The Indians of this region, the Mewuk, burned their dead, and look with
horror on the suggestion that they or their ancestors might ever have
put their dead in caves. They ask: "Would you put your mother, or your
wife, or your child, or any one you love, in a cave to be eaten by a
horrible giant?" The idea is so abhorrent to them that the theory of
cave burial must be abandoned as preposterous.

The mythology of the Mewuk does not admit of any migration but describes
the creation of the people in the area they still inhabit. This, in
connection with the fact that these Indians speak a language wholly
different from any known in any other part of the world, proves that
they have occupied the lands they now occupy for a very long period--a
period--which in my judgment should be measured by thousands of years.

This argues a great antiquity for the cave remains, for they must be
those of a people who inhabited the region before the Mewuk came--and
this takes us back a very long way into the past.
