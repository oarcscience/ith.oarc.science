### HOW WEK'-WEK WAS SAVED FROM THE FLOOD

O'-YE the Coyote-man, and *Wek'-wek* the Falcon-man quarrelled. Then
*O'-ye* gathered up the people and took them away with him across the
ocean, leaving *Wek'-wek* alone. Then he made the rain come and cover
the world with water. The water grew deeper and deeper and covered all
the trees and all the hills and all the mountains until nothing was left
but water.

*Wek'-wek* could find no place to rest--nothing to stand on--and had to
fly and fly and fly till he was all tired out. By and by he could fly no
longer and fell on the water and was floating around nearly dead when
his wing caught on a little stick. This stick stuck up from the top of
the roundhouse of *Pe'-leet* the Grebe, who came up to see what was the
matter. He found *Wek'-wek* (a relative of his) nearly drowned and
pulled him down into his roundhouse and saved him.

Then *O'-ye* the Coyote-man let the water down and brought the people
back.
