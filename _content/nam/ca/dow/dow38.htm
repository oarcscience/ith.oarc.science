<p>THE world was dark. The only light anywhere was <i>He'-koo-l&#257;s</i> the Sun-woman. She lived far away in the east.</p>  
<p>The people wanted light, and <i>O'-ye</i> the Coyote-man sent two men to bring <i>He'-koo-l&#257;s</i>. They traveled along time, for they had far to go. When they came to the place where she lived she refused to go back with them. So they came back alone and told <i>O'-ye</i>.</p>  
<p>Then he sent more men; this time he sent enough men to bring her whether she wanted to come or not. They made the long journey to her home and tied her with ropes and brought her back to make light for the people.</p>  
<p>Her entire body was covered with <i>ah'-wook</i>--the beautiful iridescent shells of the abalone; these made her shine so brightly that she gave off light and it was hard to look at her.</p>
