### GHOSTS MAY COME BACK IN SOO-KOO'-ME THE OWL

*The Middle Mewuk of Tuolumne River say*:

When a person dies, *Oo'leus* the heart-spirit remains in the dead body
for four days. During these four days everyone is quiet and the children
are not allowed to run about or make a noise. On the morning of the
fourth day the people sprinkle ashes on the ground over the buried
basket of burnt bones--or over the grave if the corpse were buried
instead of burned. On that day the heart spirit leaves the body in the
invisible form of *Hinnan Soos* the Wind Spirit, or *Soo-les'-ko* the
Ghost, and proceeds westward. That night it may come back in
*Soo-koo'-me* the Owl, or in some other animal; so look out.

Some Ghosts are good, others bad. At last they all go to the ocean and
cross over on a long pole to the Roundhouse of the dead, where they
remain.
