### Wek-wek's Search for his Sister

AFTER *Wek'-wek*, *Hoo-loo'-e* and *Yow'-hah* had returned home,
*Wek'-wek* said, "I have heard that I once had a sister; where is my
sister?"

No one answered.

Then *Wek'-wek* slept and dreamed. Then he went off alone to the north
and told no one.

*Wek'-wek* had a nephew, *Ah'-ut* the Crow. *Ah'-ut* asked the people,
"Where is my uncle?" No one answered. Then *Ah'-ut* said he would find
him, and he also set out for the north. Finding that he could not catch
up with *Wek'-wek* he shot an arrow and the arrow went over *Wek'-wek's*
head and fell just beyond.

*Wek'-wek* knew who had shot it, and said, "Who told my nephew?"

When *Ah'-ut* came up, *Wek'-wek* asked, "Why do you follow me? I'm
searching for my sister; you go home."

"No," answered *Ah'-ut*, "I'll go with you."

Then *Wek'-wek's* brothers, two little hawks, who also had been
following, overtook *Wek'-wek* and *Ah'-ut* and all went on together.

After a while they found the rancheria. It was in a big cave about two
miles below *Koo-loo'-te*

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \[now the town of
Sonora in Tuolumne County\]. *Wek'-wek* sent one of his little brothers
into the cave. He went in and on one side of the entrance saw
*O-hum'-mah-te* the Grizzly Bear, and on the other side *He-le'-jah* the
Mountain Lion) but saw nothing of the sister.

Then *Wek'-wek* sent in the other brother. When he returned he said some
one was inside cooking acorns; he had seen a woman cook the acorn soup
by putting into the basket hot quail eggs instead of hot stones. He said
also that farther back in the cave was something that looked like a
sharp rock.

Then *Ah'-ut* the Crow said he would go in. When he found the woman
cooking with the quail eggs he picked them up and took off the shells
and ate all the eggs. Then he asked the woman, "Is my uncle's sister
here?"

"Yes," she answered, "but you can't go in."

But he did go in, and when he came to *He-le'-jah* the Mountain Lion, he
said, "You are good to eat," and shot him with an arrow and killed him.
Then he turned to *O-hum'mah-te* the Grizzly Bear and said the same to
him, and killed him also and pulled him out. Then he went in farther and
saw the Sharp Rock and shot it also and killed it, and picked up his
arrow and put it back in his quiver. Then he went still farther in and
found *Wek'-wek's* sister. She was old and naked and shriveled--nothing
but bare bones--for no one had given her anything to eat.

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

*Ah'-ut* returned and told *Wek'-wek* he could now go in, and *Wek'-wek*
went in. When he saw his sister without clothes and all bones he felt
badly and cried. Then he took her out and helped her walk, and cooked
some acorns and fed her. Then he sent her home with his brothers.
