### HOW CHA'-KA THE TULE-WREN SHOT OUT THE SUN

CHA'-KA the Tule-wren was a poor worthless boy. He had no father and no
mother and went from house to house begging, and the people gave him
food to eat. Nobody liked him, and finally they tired of feeding him.
One day he told them that if they did not give him food he would shoot
out the Sun. Then everybody laughed. Again he said he surely would shoot
it out. They said, "Go ahead and shoot."

So he did; he sent his arrow right up into the Sun and let the light out
and the whole world became dark. There was no Sun, no Moon, no Stars, no
Fire-everything was dark. It was dark for years and years and the people
could not see to find food, and everybody was starving.

All this time *O'-ye* the Coyote-man was thinking how he could get the
Sun and light back again. At length he saw just a little light a long
way off. He sent *Koo-loo'-pe* the Humming-bird to steal it.

*Koo-loo'-pe* set out on the long journey and finally came to the fire
and stole a little piece and

brought it back under his chin--you can see the blaze there to this day.

When he was bringing it somebody chased him, but he was so small and
flew so swiftly they could not see which way he went and could not catch
him. So he escaped with the fire and brought it back to *O'-ye* the
Coyote-man, and the people had light again.
