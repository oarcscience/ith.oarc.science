<p>WHEN <i>O'-ye</i> the Coyote-man had everything ready he thought he would make people. So he gathered a lot of sticks of different kinds--some hard, as oak, madrone, and manzanita; some soft and hollow, as the sage-herb--and made a big pile of them and said that by and by they would turn into people.</p>  
<p>Then he went over all the country and whereever he wanted a village he laid down two sticks, and gave the place a name--and the name he gave it then has always been its name and is its name to this day. Then he went away.</p>  
<p>In a short time the sticks turned into people, and all the rancherias were started with the first real people.</p>  
<p>In places where he had put sticks of hard wood the people were strong and well and warm-blooded and could stand cold weather; but in places where he put poor wood the people were weak and sickly and could not stand cold weather. Here at Bodega Bay he left only sticks of <i>Po'-to-po'-to</i> the sage-herb,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A> which has a hollow stem and has no strength. That is the reason our people are tender and weak</p>

<p>and can not stand cold, and why nearly all died soon after the white men came. We are hollow inside and can not stand cold.</p>
