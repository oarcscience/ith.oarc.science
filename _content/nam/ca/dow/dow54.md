### THREE BIRDS SCREAM TO FRIGHTEN THE GHOSTS

*The Southern Mewuk of the Chowchilla region say*:

After a person dies his *Hoo'-ne* or Ghost sets out toward the ocean. On
the way it has to cross a broad river on a log. While it is crossing on
this log, three birds scream to frighten it--*Hek-ek'-ke* the Quail,
*Ha-chah'-we* the Barn Owl, and *Hah'-jen-nah* a small Heron.

If the Ghost is frightened and falls into the river it turns into a
fish; but if it keeps on and crosses the log it continues westerly over
the ocean and goes to the place where all the Ghosts live together, and
never comes back.
