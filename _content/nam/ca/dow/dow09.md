### HOW AH-HA'-LE STOLE THE MORNING

As told by the Chowchilla Mewuk

IN the long ago time the world was dark and there was no fire. The only
light was the Morning, <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7) and it was so
far away in the high mountains of the east that the people could not see
it; they lived in total darkness. The chief *We'-wis-sool*, the Golden
Eagle, felt very badly because it was always dark and cried all the
time.

*Ah-hā'-le* the Coyote-man made up his mind to go and get the Morning in
order that the people might have light. So he set out on the long
journey to the east, up over the high mountains, saying, "I'm going to
get the Morning."

Finally he came to *Ah-wahn'-dah* the Turtle. *Ah-wahn'-dah* was
guardian of the Morning; he wore a big basket on his back. When
*Ah-hā'-le* came close to *Ah-wahn'-dah* he was afraid something would
catch him and carry him off. He said to himself, "I'm going to turn
myself into a log of wood so I'll be too heavy to be carried off," and
he turned into a big dry limb. *Ah-wahn'-dah* the Turtle put fire to the
limb, but it would not burn; then he fell asleep.

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

When the Guardian had gone to sleep *Ah-hā'-le* got up and said, "Now
I'm going to get the Morning." So he changed back into his own form and
put out his foot and touched the Morning, and it growled. He then caught
hold of it and jumped quickly and ran away with it and brought it back
to his people.

When he arrived he said to *We'-wis-sool* the Eagle, "How are you?"

*We'-wis-sool* answered, "All right," but was still crying because it
was dark.

Then *Ah-hā'-le* said, "Tomorrow morning it is going to be light," but
*We'-wis-sool* did not believe him.

In the morning *Ah-hā'-le* gave the people the light. *We'-wis-sool* was
very happy and asked *Ah-hā'-le* where he got it, and *Ah-hā'-le* told
him. Then the people began to walk around and find things to eat, for
now they could see.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_6"></span>[44:7](dow09.htm#fr_6) The word *We'-wis-sool* or
*We'-wŭ-sool* is not of Mewan origin but is borrowed from the Yokut
tribes immediately to the south--the Chuk-chan'-sy and Kosh-sho'-o. In
the Mewuk language the Golden Eagle is called *We'-pi-ahk* or
*We-pi-ah'-gah*.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[45:8](dow09.htm#fr_7) Morning, in this story, is
obviously synonymous with sun and light, and probably with fire also, as
in the preceding story.
