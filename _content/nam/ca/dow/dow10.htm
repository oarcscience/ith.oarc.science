<p align="center">A TALE OF THE NORTHERN MEWUK</p>  
<p>The Mountain People lived in the Sierra near the Mokelumne River, which they called <i>Ut'-ta Wah-kah'-loo</i>, meaning big river. They had no fire and the world was dark.</p>  
<p>The Valley People lived on the San Joaquin Plain, which they called <i>Ol-law'-win</i>. Their roundhouse was not far from the spot now occupied by the city of Stockton. They had a small fire in the middle of the roundhouse and <i>Wit'-tab-bah</i> the Robin was its keeper.</p>

<p>WEK'-WEK the Falcon and <i>We'-pi-ah'-gah</i> the Golden Eagle were Chiefs of the Valley People. Among the members of their tribe were <i>Mol'-luk</i> the Condor; <i>Hoo'-a-zoo</i> the Turkey Buzzard; <i>Hoo-loo'-e</i> the Dove; <i>Te-wi'-yu</i> the Red-shafted Flicker, who must have been very close to the fire--as any one can see from the red under his wings and tail, and <i>Wit'-tab-bah</i> the red-breasted Robin, who was keeper of the fire. There were also <i>Hah-ki'-ah</i> the Elk, <i>Hal'-loo-zoo</i> the Antelope, <i>Sahk'-mum-chah</i> the Cinnamon Bear, and others.</p>  
<p>The Mountain People were in darkness and wanted fire but did not know where it was or how to get it. <i>O-l&#257;-choo</i> the Coyote-man tried hard to find it but did not succeed. After a while <i>Tol'-le-loo</i> the White-footed Mouse discovered the fire and the Mountain People sent him to steal it.</p>  
<p><i>Tol'-le-loo</i> took his flute (<i>loo'-lah</i>) of elderberry wood and went down into the Valley and found the big roundhouse of <i>Wek'-wek</i> and <i>We-pi-ah'-gah</i> and began to play. The people liked the music and asked him to come inside. So he went in and played for them. Soon all the people felt</p>  
<p><a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="green">p. 50</font></A></p>  
<p>sleepy. <i>Wit'-tab-bah</i> the Robin was sure that <i>Tol'-le-loo</i> had come to steal the fire, so he spread himself over it and covered it all up in order to hide it, and it turned his breast red. But <i>Tol'-le-loo</i> kept on playing his flute<i>--</i>and in a little while all the people were sound asleep; even <i>Wit'-tab-bah</i> could not keep awake.</p>  
<p>Then <i>Tol'-le-loo</i> ran up to <i>Wit'-tab-bah</i> and cut a little hole in his wing and crawled through and stole the fire and put it inside his flute. When he had done this he ran out with it and climbed up to the top of the high mountain called <i>Oo'-yum-bel'-le</i> (Mount Diablo) and made a great fire which lighted up all the country till even the blue mountains far away in the east [the Sierra Nevada range] could be seen. Before this all the world was dark.</p>  
<p>When <i>Wek'-wek</i> awoke he saw the fire on <i>Oo'-yum-bel'-le</i> and knew that <i>Tol'-le-loo</i> had stolen it. So he ran out and followed him and after a while caught him.</p>  
<p><i>Tol'-le-loo</i> said, "Look and see if I have the fire."</p>  
<p><i>Wek'-wek</i> looked but could not find it, for it was inside the flute. Then <i>Wek'-wek</i> pitched <i>Tot'-le-loo</i> into the water and let him go.</p>  
<p><i>Tol'-le-loo</i> got out and went east into the mountains and carried the fire in his flute to the Mountain People; then he took it out of the flute and put it on the ground and covered it with leaves and pine needles and tied it up in a small bundle.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> <i>O-l&#257;'-choo</i> the Coyote smelled it and wanted to steal it. He came up and pushed it with his nose and was going to swallow it when it suddenly shot up into the sky and became the Sun.</p>  
<p><i>O-l&#257;'-choo</i> sent <i>Le'-che-che</i> the Humming-bird, and another bird, named <i>Le-che-koo'-tah-mah</i>, who also had a long bill, after it, but they could not catch it and came back without it.</p>  
<p>The people took the fire that was left and put it into two trees, <i>oo'-noo</i> the buckeye and <i>mon'-o-go</i> the incense cedar, where it still is and where it can be had by anyone who wants it.</p>  
<p>NOTE--This story has been told me by several Mewuk Indians independently. The only variation of consequence is that, in one version, <i>Wek'-wek</i> and <i>We-pi-ah'-gah</i> gave a feast and invited the Mountain People to come; and it was while they were there that <i>Tol'-le-loo</i> put the Valley People to sleep with his flute and ran off with the fire. The story is called <i>Oo'-ten-nas'-se-sa</i>, though of course this is only a part.</p>
