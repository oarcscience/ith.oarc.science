<p>OO-SOO'-MA-TE the Grizzly Bear and <i>Hoi-ah'-ko</i> the First People made the first Mewuk [Indian people]. When the Mewuk were made they had no hands to take hold of things. Then <i>Pe-t&#257;'-lit-te</i> the Little Lizard and <i>Suk'-ka-de</i> the Black Lizard gave them hands with five fingers.</p>  
<p>When the first Mewuk [Indian] died, <i>Suk'-ka-de</i> the Black Lizard was sorry and set to work to bring him back to life. But <i>Yu'-kah-loo</i> the Meadowlark came and drove him away, saying, "<i>Mewuk ut'-tud-dah, Mewuk tuk'-tuk-ko</i>"--meaning, People no good, people smell.</p>  
<p>NOTE--The <i>P&#257;'-we-nan</i>, who lived on the Sacramento and Feather Rivers from the junction of American River northward nearly to the Yuba, hold a belief which, while in some respects strikingly similar, is in other respects widely different. They say:</p>  
<p>In the beginning <i>Hi'-kaht</i> the great chief said that when a person died, he should come to life on the fourth day thereafter, and should live again.</p>  
<p>Then <i>Hool</i> the Meadowlark-man said No; he</p>  
<p><a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="green">p. 56</font></A></p>  
<p>did not want <i>Nis'-se-nan'</i> [people] to live again after they were dead. He said <i>Nis'-se-nan'</i> were no good and by and by would smell; they had better stay dead.</p>  
<p><i>Yawm</i> the Coyote-man agreed with Hool the Meadowlark-man--he did not want people to live again; he wanted them to stay dead.</p>  
<p><i>Yawm</i> the Coyote-man had a daughter of whom he was very fond.</p>  
<p><i>Hi'-kaht</i> the great chief, after hearing <i>Yawm</i> say that he wanted people to stay dead after they died, went out into the brush and took a branch of a plant called <i>Sak-ki-ak</i> and laid it in the trail. In the night the plant turned into <i>Koi'-maw</i> the rattlesnake. The next morning <i>Yawm's</i> daughter came along the trail and <i>Koi'-maw</i> bit her and she died.</p>  
<p><i>Yawm</i> the Coyote-man found the dead body of his daughter and felt badly. He picked her up and said, "In four days you will come to life again."</p>  
<p>But <i>Hi'-kaht</i> replied, "No, she will not come to life again. You said that when people died you wanted them to stay dead. So your daughter will stay dead and will not live again."</p>  
<p>This is the reason why everybody stays dead after they die and nobody lives again.</p>
