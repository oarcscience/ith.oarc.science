<p>HE-LE'-JAH the Cougar or Mountain Lion had two wives, <i>Oo-soo'-ma-te</i> the Grizzly Bear-woman and <i>Paht'-ki-yu</i> the Raccoon-woman. Their children looked a little like people but still were not people. Every year there were more children, and as they grew up and had children of their own, the children came to look more and more like people, only they had no fingers.</p>  
<p>Then <i>Pe-t&#257;'-le</i> the Lizard gave them five fingers and they became real people (<i>Me'wuk</i>).</p>
