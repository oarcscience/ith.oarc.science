# 7.--POHONICHI MIWOK. THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD.

Told among the Chukchansi Yokuts.

Before there were people there was only water everywhere. Coyote looked
among, the ducks and sent a certain species (Chukchansi: yimeit) to
dive. It first it said it was unable to. Then it went down. It reached
the bottom, bit the earth, and came up again. Coyote took the earth from
it and sent it for chanit (Yokuts name) seeds. When the duck brought
these he mixed them with the earth and water. Then the mixture swelled
until the water had disappeared. The earth was there.
