<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">22.--TACHI YOKUTS. THE BALD EAGLE AND THE PRAIRIE FALCON.</H1>
<P>At a mountain southwest from the north end of Tulare Lake the ground is red and white. There the bald eagle, owik, lived. He used to take away men's wives. If they became angry he killed them. The prairie falcon, limik, lived farther north in the Coast Range with the Tachi. The eagle took away his wife. Then the prairie falcon pursued him. He fought him. He broke his head with a rock and killed him. The bald eagle's brains and blood turned the ground white and red.</P>
