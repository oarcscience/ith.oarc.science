# 8.--POHONICHI MIWOK. THE THEFT OF FIRE.

Told among the Chukchansi Yokuts.

At first there was no fire. The turtle had it all. He sat on it and
covered it up. He lived far up in the east in the mountains. Coyote went
to that place. He lay down like a piece of wood. The people who lived
there came by and saw him. "I am going to take this piece of wood," they
said. They took him home and put him in the fire. Coyote tried to get
into the fire under the turtle. The turtle said'. "Stop pushing me." Now
Coyote got some of the fire. Then he ran down-hill with it westward

{p. 203}

into this country, where then there was no fire and it was cold. He
caught a quail and with its fat he made his fire blaze up. Now the
people first all became warm. The Mono (Shoshoneans) were far back up in
the hills; the Chukchansi (Yokuts) in the middle; the Pohonichi (Miwok)
were the ones who received the fire. Coyote was one of them. That is why
the Mono cannot speak well; it is too cold where they live.

Coyote made the eagle the chief of the people. They enjoyed themselves
and made dances. They were warm now because they had fire. They lived
well. They wore no clothes. Some men wore a blanket of rabbit skins or
of deer skin; others wore nothing. They used hollow stones to cook in,
made of soft red stone. The eagle told them: "Go out and catch rabbits,"
and then they caught rabbits to eat. To get salt they went beyond the
North Fork of the San Joaquin.
