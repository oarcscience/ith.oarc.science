</FONT><P>Before there were people there was only water everywhere. Coyote looked among, the ducks and sent a certain species (Chukchansi: yimeit) to dive. It first it said it was unable to. Then it went down. It reached the bottom, bit the earth, and came up again. Coyote took the earth from it and sent it for chanit (Yokuts name) seeds. When the duck brought these he mixed them with the earth and water. Then the mixture swelled until the water had disappeared. The earth was there.</P>
