# 18.--TACHI YOKUTS. THE OWNERS OF THE SUN.

In the Tachi territory in the Coast Range is a circle of large rocks.

the circle, just above their heads. Coyote and

{p. 213}

the eagle took it away from them. Then they became ashamed and turned to

reach that place, for they do not like to be seen by anyone, and when
one approaches it he meets wind and rain.
