# 12.--GASHOWU YOKUTS. THE ORIGIN OF DEATH.

A person was dying. Then some people said: "Let it be that he lies
outside for three days. Then he will get up and be a person again." Now
there was one newly married man, the meadow-lark. He did not like the
dead person lying near his house because the body smelled. He said: "We
will take the dead one away and burn him." So the people were persuaded.
They built a pile of wood, laid the body on it, and burned it. Thus the
people of old times did, and so people die now and do not come back.
