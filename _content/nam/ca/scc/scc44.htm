<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">III. ABSTRACTS.</H1>
<P>1. <I>Rumsien Costanoan</I>. Water covers the world. The humming-bird and Coyote are on Pico Blanco. They fly to the Sierra del Gabilan. The water subsides. Coyote finds a woman and by order of the eagle marries her. The manner of making children is discussed. Coyote makes his wife louse him and swallow what she finds. She becomes pregnant and runs away. He follows, vainly trying to delay her, until she throws herself into the ocean. (<I>Cf.</I> 7, 11, 15, 25, 37.)</P>
<P>2. <I>Rumsien Costanoan</I>. Coyote marries a second wife to have. more children. He sends the children out to found villages with different languages. He gives the people bow and arrows and instructs them how to gather and prepare food. He becomes old and goes away.</P>
<P>3. <I>Rumsien Costanoan</I>. Coyote vainly tries to kill the humming-bird. At last he swallows him, but the humming-bird scratches, him so that he is forced to let him out.</P>
<P>4. <I>Rumsien Costanoan</I>. Coyote takes his wife to the ocean after warning her not to be frightened at the sea animals. He forgets to tell her of one, which when it appears frightens the woman to death. Coyote restores her to life.</P>
<P>5. <I>Rumsien Costanoan</I>. Coyote wishing to keep his cooked salmon for himself, pretends to his children that he is eating ashes.</P>
<P>6. <I>Rumsien Costanoan</I>. Coyote, pretending to have a thorn in his eye, comes to women. When one of them tries to draw it, he runs off with her.</P>
<P>7. <I>Pohonichi Miwok</I>. At first there is only water. Coyote sends a duck to dive and it brings up earth, from which he makes the world, (<I>Cf.</I> 1, 11, 15, 25, 37.)</P>
<P>8. <I>Pohonichi Miwok</I>. The turtle, far in the mountains, alone has fire. Coyote turns himself into a piece of wood, is put into the fire, and runs off with it to the Miwok. (Cf. 16, 26.)</P>
<P>9. <I>Pohonichi Miwok</I>. On the first human death, Coyote wishes to revive the person, but the meadow lark, thinking there will be no room on the earth, prevails that men should die. Coyote institutes cremation of the dead. (<I>Cf.</I> 12, 17, 38.)</P>
<P>10. <I>Pohonichi Miwok</I>. The grizzly bear and the deer, two women, each have two children. The two women go out together and the grizzly bear kills the deer. The deer children kill the two bear children in a sweat-house, and flee from the grizzly bear to their grandfather. As she enters his sweat-house she is killed by his supernatural power. The two boys become thunders. (For the thunder twins, cf. 23. Cf. the Kwakiutl, &Ccedil;atloltq, Thompson, Kathlamet, and Lutuami parallels cited by Dixon, 341; also Dixon, 49, and Powers, 341.)</P>
<P>11. <I>Gashowu Yokuts.</I> At the bidding of the prairie falcon various birds and water animals dive for earth when everything is water. A small cluck alone reaches the bottom. From a little sand left under his finger nail the prairie falcon, adding tobacco, makes the earth and the mountains by</P>
<P>{p. 246}</P>
<P>dropping the mixture into the water. The raven's mountains, now the Sierra Nevada, but then along the coast, being the larger, the prairie falcon interchanges them. (<I>Cf.</I> 1, 7, 15, 25, 37.)</P>
<P>12. <I>Gashowu Yokuts.</I> At a person's death it is resolved that after three days people are to return to life. The meadow lark, being newly married, dislikes the stench of the corpse and persuades the people to burn it. (<I>Cf.</I> 9, 17, 38.)</P>
<P>13. <I>Gashowu Yokuts.</I> Coyote's pretense to be a medicine man is exposed when he fails to revive the dead prairie falcon. The white owl brings him back to life.</P>
<P>14. <I>Gashowu Yokuts.</I> A woman, the hawk, lives alone and hides all the deer. The people hunt in vain. The wolf and Coyote find her and are given food. The people discover that their families are supplied with meat. The magpie, who has supernatural knowledge, informs the chief, the eagle. and the people all go to the woman, who is compelled to feed them. Many men wish to marry her, but all fail. They leave, but Coyote, pretending sickness, remains. By making a storm he persuades her to admit him into the house. She knows his thoughts and long resists his desires, but finally consents to marry him. She meets him with a rattlesnake, but is foiled by his use of a stick on which the rattlesnake is disabled.</P>
<P>The condor, the son of Coyote and the woman, is made to grow up quickly by being, immersed in water (<I>cf.</I> 34), and becomes a famous gambler. When traveling he aims at an owl, who, being a medicine man, sings and changes him into a condor who flies off. When Coyote returns his wife kills him with a rattlesnake. The condor lives in the sky, killing people for food. He carries up his mother and two little boys and a girl. He keeps the children to eat later. His mother instructs them. When he returns to drink for half a day and then to mount to the higher sky from which he will descend to kill them, they shoot at him. Half a day's shooting has no apparent effect and the woman and the children hide. The condor rises, but finally falls dead and is burnt. His eyes fly out, are lost in the brush, and turn to condors. The woman and the little girl return to earth on a feather rope. The two boys go south in the sky until they reach the earth. They come to people who can neither talk nor eat and who live by odor. The boys cut months and tongues for them and return home.</P>
<P>15. Truhohi Yokuts. The world is covered with water. A mountain top is the only land. The people eat this for food. The eagle, urged by Coyote, succeeds in having the mudhen bring up earth by diving. From this earth mixed with seeds, the world is made. The wolf is sent out to go around it. Coyote, though forbidden, also makes the circuit, and, breaking the soft ground in his journey, produces the mountains. The eagle sends the prairie falcon and the raven northward to make the mountain ranges. At first the Coast Range is higher than the Sierra Nevada. The eagle sends off the animals to different places to become people. (Usually in Indian myths the "first people" turn to animals. <I>Cf.</I> 32). The eagle himself rises to the sky. To his surprise Coyote follows him. (<I>Cf.</I> 1, 7, 11, 25, 37.)</P>
<P>16. <I>Truhohi Yokuts.</I> The crow, sent out by the eagle, succeeds in finding fire. The roadrunner, the fox, the crow, and Coyote go north, and</P>
<P>{p. 247}</P>
<P>when the people are asleep steal fire. Coyote delays to kill a child and is pursued. Turning in his flight, he makes the crooked course of the San Joaquin river. Reaching his sweat-house he is safe from pursuit. (<I>Cf.</I> 8, 26.)</P>
<P>17. <I>Truhohi Yokuts.</I> Two insects dispute whether people are to live or die. The one favoring death prevails. Coyote is satisfied because there will be festivities at mourning ceremonies. (<I>Cf.</I> 9, 12, 38.)</P>
<P>18. <I>Truhohi Yokuts.</I> People living in the Coast Range keep the sun. Coyote and the eagle take it away from them. The people turn to a circle of stones.</P>
<P>19. <I>Tachi Yokuts.</I> The antelope and deer race. Their course is the Milky Way. The antelope wins and lives in the plains. The deer goes into the brush. (Many and close eastern parallels. <I>Cf.</I> Pawnee and Blackfoot, by Grinnell; also Arapaho, Field Columbian Mus. Anthr. Ser. V, 16.)</P>
<P>20. <I>Tachi Yokuts.</I> The Pleiades are five girls who are in love with a flea. In summer he becomes sick and they leave him while he is asleep. He pursues and they rise to the sky. He follows them and is a star near them. (See footnote as to Yaudanchi version.)</P>
<P>21. <I>Tachi Yokuts.</I> The wolf gives his wife, the crane, and his children nothing to eat. She leaves him. He follows and tries to kill her. She stabs hint to the heart with her bill. She goes off with her two boys, and they become stars in the constellation Orion.</P>
<P>22. <I>Tachi Yokuts.</I> The bald eagle steals men's wives. When he takes the prairie falcon's, the latter pursues and kills him.</P>
<P>23. <I>Tachi Yokuts.</I> Two boys, twins, are abused by their parents because they are covered with sores. Their grandmother pities them. Their parents leave with the people during a famine. The boys catch an abundance of fish in a spring. They acquire supernatural power, turning to thunders. Their mother's brother visits them and finds them provided with food. Their parents come with other people and are killed. (<I>Cf.</I> No. 10 and the Yuki story given.)</P>
<P>24. <I>Tachi Yokuts.</I> A woman dies. Her husband stays by her grave. She arises from the ground and for six rights he follows her on her Journey to the island of the dead. He cannot cross the bridge to the island until permitted by the chief of that country. A bird, darting up to frighten him into falling off, fails. He sees the people dancing. During the night he is with his wife. In the morning she is a fallen tree. After six days the chief sends him home. He is told not to show himself for six days. After five days he comes out from concealment and tells the people his experiences. In the morning a rattlesnake bites him and he dies. Front him the people learn that the island is continually filling up with the dead. They are taken to bathe, when a bird frightens them and many turn to fish and birds. In this way room is made on the island for others that die. (<I>Cf.</I> 15.)</P>
<P>5. <I>W&uuml;kchamni Yokuts.</I> The world is covered with water, except for one small spot on which are the eagle and Coyote. They send the duck to dive to the bottom and it brings them earth. From this they make the world. They make six men and six women, whom they send out in different directions. Coyote, sent out by the eagle to see what the people do, reports that they are eating the earth. The eagle sends out the dove and it finds</P>
<P>{p. 248}</P>
<P>a grain of meal. From this the eagle makes seeds all over the earth, and the people live on these. (Cf. 1, 7, 11, 15, 37.)</P>
<P>26. <I>Yaudanchi Yokuts.</I> Fire is kept by a man in the plains to the west. The antelope and other animals steal it, but on their return the fire is always put out by rain. The jackrabbit burrows and holds the fire in his hands under his belly. (<I>Cf.</I> Ute, Journ. Am. Folk-lore, XIV, 259, 1901.) He returns successfully. (<I>Cf.</I> 8, 16.)</P>
<P>27. <I>Yaudanchi Yokuts.</I> The eagle is chief. The condor attempts to replace him. The eagle catches him from ambush and the condor acknowledges his supremacy. (<I>Cf.</I> the actual practice of the Plains tribes in catching eagles.)</P>
<P>28. <I>Yaudanchi Yokuts</I>. The eagle's son, though forbidden, goes over a hill where he meets people. Several girls abuse him. Coyote and the black-faced dog try to shoot him but fail. Having returned home, the eagle's son goes out again. This time he is fine in appearance and the girls fall in love with him. They follow him, but none are received by his grandmother except the woodpecker, who before had not abused him. The others strike her on the head and make it red. She throws fire and ashes at them, spotting them with red, black, and gray. The eagle's son goes over the hill once more and kills Coyote and the dog.</P>
<P>29. <I>Yaudanchi Yokuts.</I> The prairie falcon, traveling, comes to a village. He frightens the people, kills them, and hangs up their hair on trees.</P>
<P>30. <I>Yaudanchi Yokuts.</I> The prairie falcon leaves his wife in charge of Coyote, who sleeps, and she is carried to the sky by the condor. The lizard at last locates her and the fly finds her. The prairie falcon goes up and brings her back.</P>
<P>31. <I>Yaudanchi Yokuts.</I> The prairie falcon wins at playing. Coyote goes to a mountain and rolls himself down until he looks like the prairie falcon. He then goes to the prairie falcon's wife and cohabits with her. From that time the prairie falcon's opponents win back what they have lost. (<I>Cf.</I> 40.)</P>
<P>32. <I>Yaudanchi Yokuts.</I> The foothill people fight those of the plains. Coyote and the humming-bird are the leaders. They beat the plains people, but cannot kill a fish and the turtle. Coyote makes arrow points of his own leg bone and kills them both. Then the eagle sends off the people (to become animals; <I>cf.</I> 15), and each one tells how he will live. They go off and turn to animals.</P>
<P>33. <I>Yaundanchi</I> {<I>sic</I>} <I>Yokuts</I>. Thunder and Whirlwind both hide the other's son, but each succeeds in recovering his own.</P>
<P>34. <I>Yaudanchi (?) Yokuts</I>. A girl living alone with her mother goes too far to gather clover, and, disobeying her instructions, eats some. A grizzly bear devours her. Her mother finds a trace of blood where she has been killed, puts it in a basket, and, leaving it in a spring, finds a boy in it. She makes bows and arrows for her grandson, who kills birds of different kinds. He takes a good bow left by his dead relatives. He goes and shouts for the grizzly bear. Several come but he sends them back. When the one comes that has killed his mother, he kills him. He sets up the skin at the spring, and sends his grandmother to bring him water. She is frightened, runs, and brings him urine. He tells her what he has done.</P>
<P>{p. 249}</P>
<P>35. <I>Yaudanchi Yokuts.</I> A woman dies. Her husband stays at her grave. His wife arises from the ground and he follows her for several nights. She crosses the bridge to the world of the dead. He cannot follow her until permitted by the guardians. He is hungry and is given one pinenut, which multiplies and satisfies him. (A common episode in American mythologies.) At night the people dance. He is told to return with his wife, but they are forbidden to go to sleep. The third night he sleeps, and in the morning lies beside a log. (Cf. 24.)</P>
<P>36. <I>Yaudanchi Yokuts.</I> A man and his wife pass the night in a cave. The man calls owls by hooting and shoots them. Having killed two, he wishes to stop, but his wife urges him to continue. The owls come in great numbers and attack them. He resists, but finally both are killed.</P>
<P>37. <I>Yauelmani Yokuts.</I> The world is covered with water. In a nest on a tree (upright wood) arising from the water, are the eagle and six others, including Coyote. The eagle sends ducks to (live and finally receives earth. Mixing this with seeds, he makes the world. In the morning the eagle tells the wolf to shout. The earth disappears. They make the world over again. When the wolf shouts in the morning, there is an earthquake, but the earth remains. Coyote wishes to shout also, but the earth scarcely trembles. Now they live on the earth. Every evening tobacco enters the water. Coyote makes a snare and catches it. It is burning like fire. It says that if used its power is to bring anything to pass that is desired. (This episode resembles a Yurok myth of the origin of obsidian.) The prairie falcon uses the tobacco and on the first trial makes rain. Coyote kills a deer and makes a woman of it. Being killed by his first cohabitation with her, he is revived by the prairie falcon. He makes her over and is successful. (<I>Cf.</I> 1, 7, 11, 15, 25.) The prairie falcon lives from tobacco alone (like the Yurok hero Pulekukwerek).</P>
<P>38. <I>Yauelmani Yokuts.</I> Coyote wants human hands to be closed like his, but the lizard prevails and people have hands with fingers. Then Coyote makes it that people die. (<I>Cf.</I> 9, 17. For the incident of the hand, cf. Maidu, Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist. XVII, 42; Yana, Creat. Myths Prim. Am., 479; also Yuki, etc.)</P>
<P>39. <I>Yauelmani Yokuts.</I> The humming-bird, Coyote's son, wins at gambling, and the people try to kill him by causing a great fire. Coyote and his son escape to a distant mountain. Coyote returns. He gathers wood. He travels to the moon, thunder, sun, night, and persuades them not to come. He returns and for six months there is no light and constant rain. Finally Coyote, returning the eagle's gifts, consents to bring back the sun. He visits the same powers as before, and when he shouts they reappear.</P>
<P>Coyote starts to visit his son. He catches fish but rejects all except the biggest. Going on, he cooks them all. He drinks alkali water and becomes sick. When he returns to his cooking, he finds only the tails. A bird has eaten the fish. Coyote finds him and asks for half the fish. The bird vomits them. Coyote tries to kill him but after following him a long time loses him. He comes to Tulare lake and tries to kill ducks. They quack and he dances to the sound until he falls into the water. He comes to a bird that gives him fish, and then to another. He comes to other birds and asks to have his nose made red. They hold him in the fire until he is dead. He returns to life and rejoins them. They tell him to dive for what appears</P>
<P>{p. 250}</P>
<P>to be a fish. He jumps into the water and is dashed to death on a rock. He comes to life and goes on. He reaches a village where he stays.</P>
<P>The people there gamble. The prairie falcon loses everything. (Cf. 31, 40.) He stakes his eyes and loses them. At night, accompanied by his friend the crow, he starts to go northward. As he goes he sings. When the crow becomes hungry and thirsty, he makes food and water for him. They spend the night in a village. They go on. The prairie falcon still sings. They reach another village. The third night they reach the Kaweah river. The fourth night they come to the Chowchilla.</P>
<P>40. <I>Yauelmani Yokuts.</I> Many people live together, with the eagle as chief. Coyote is servant. The prairie falcon is a successful gambler. The rabbit visits the people and wins all they have. Next day he gambles with the prairie falcon and loses everything. He loses one ear and stakes the second. Then Coyote goes to the prairie falcon's wife and cohabits with her. Now the prairie falcon loses everything that he has. (<I>Cf.</I> 31.) That night he goes off toward the coast. He comes to an old woman and a girl. He marries the girl. At night her two brothers, who constantly fight, come in. In the morning they go fishing and he catches rabbits. Next day he goes with them on the ocean. A wind blows the boat out to sea. The two boys by magic make a rope which draws them back to land. Next day the same thing happens, but the prairie falcon falls into the water and is drowned. Coyote, the prairie falcon's uncle, knows of his nephew's death by his heart trying to leave his body. The two boys show him where the prairie falcon fell into the water. Coyote dives down. Coming to seven trails he learns by means of his tobacco which to follow. He comes to a house "here he finds a man who is being burnt for fuel. The prairie falcon is there. Coyote takes him away and restores him to life.</P>
<P>41. <I>Gitanemuk Shoshonean.</I> A woman and her daughter live alone. Game is left at their door. After a time the girl gives birth to twins. She does not see her husband. Coyote comes there when the girl is away. He sends the old woman to get water in an openwork basket and steals the children. He brings them up. The panther, who is their father, cannot find them. The boys kill deer. Coyote has warned them against their father. They meet him. He hides and Coyote comes. The panther kills him. Then he kills Coyote's wife and children.</P></BODY>
