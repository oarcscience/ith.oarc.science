# 29.--YAUDANCHI YOKUTS. THE PRAIRIE FALCON FIGHTS.\[1\]

Long ago the prairie falcon (limik) lived alone. He came to a village.
He returned. Then he went again. He reached a rock. He sat on top of it
and laid his bow down on it. Then he thought: "It will be good if I kill
them." He started again. Then he began the fight. He shot at them. At
once the people there all became angry. There was a great battle. He
killed them all. Then he hung up the hair of the killed on trees. It can
be seen still (as moss) at a place called khodomo (probably in the
territory of the Shoshonean Tübatulabal or Pitanisha).
