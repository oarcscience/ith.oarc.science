### THE ORIGIN OF PEOPLE

(Big Smoky Valley, Nevada. Shoshoni)

Wolf had a big water jug. He said to his brother, Coyote, "Coyote, don't
touch or open this jug. Be careful!" Then Wolf went away. Coyote said,
"What is the matter with my brother? What is in that jug? Why did he
tell me not to open it? I am going to open it." Coyote pulled out the
stopper.

Many people came out and flew away. <span id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16)
He replaced the stopper,

while a few remained. The good ones had come out and had flown away like
flies.

Wolf told Coyote they were going to move. He told Coyote to carry the
big jug. They went to Smoky Valley. Wolf did not know that Coyote had
opened the jug. He thought all the people were still in. When they came
to Smoky Valley, Wolf said, "Open that jug!" Just a few Indians came
out. They are the Shoshoni.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_16"></span>[266:17](wsm13.htm#fr_16) "Flew away" is
probably the informant's confusion, rather than part of the native tale.
In fact, this legend is not only synoptic, but probably incomplete.
