### ORIGIN OF DEATH

(Big Smoky Valley, Nevada. Shoshoni)

Wolf said, "When people die, they must die twice." Coyote said "That
isn't right. I don't want people to die twice. They must die once and be
buried."

Wolf bewitched Coyote's boy and wished that he would die. Coyote knew
that he had done this. The boy died. Coyote went to Wolf crying. He
said, "Oh, brother, you said when people died they should get up and die
again. When will my boy get up?" Wolf said, "Don't you remember saying
they should die only once?"
