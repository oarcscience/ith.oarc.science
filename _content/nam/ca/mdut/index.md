# Maidu Texts

## By Roland B. Dixon

#### \[1912\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Maidu lived in the central Sierra Nevada of California, to the north
of Yosemite. The Maidu, who were not particularly numerous to begin
with, were decimated by the incursion of Americans. These texts were
collected by a linguist at the beginning of the 20th century.

In these texts Coyote is the central character. He is first seen in the
company of Earth-Maker, giving him advice about how to build the world.
The Maidu tales of Coyote are well known for being exceptionally
transgressive; he is constantly seducing women by guile and deceit.
While these stories are very entertaining, they shouldn't be taken to
imply that this was normal behavior for Maidu. The trickster figure is
an anti-hero, used as a way of defining the limits of the acceptable.
