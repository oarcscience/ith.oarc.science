# ACHOMAWI AND ATSUGEWI TALES.

## BY ROLAND B. DIXON.

THE following myths were secured during the summers of 1900 and 1903,
while engaged in work among the tribes of northeastern California for
the Huntington Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History.
Some were secured in text, but nearly half were obtained only in brief
form in English. The last myths are from the Atsugewi or Hat Creek
Indians, the remainder from the Achomawi or Pit River tribe. Both tribes
form part of the Shastan stock, of which the Shasta are perhaps the
best-known members. My chief informants were, among the former Charley
Snook, and among the latter Charley Green and "Old Wool."
