### THE THREE BROTHERS

Facing the Cathedral Spires across the Valley are The Three Brothers, so
called, it is said, from the fact that on the second expedition of the
Mariposa Battalion into the Valley in 1851, a party of Indian scouts
were captured near the base of this mountain, three of whom turned out
to be brothers, the sons of old chief Te-na-ya. The Indian name for
these peaks is Waw-haw-kee, signifying "falling rocks." Here again the
almost perfect symmetry of outline suggests man's collaboration in the
more unthinking architecture of nature.
