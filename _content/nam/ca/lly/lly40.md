### BERRIES AND NUTS

Many varieties of edible berries were to be found in the Valley. From
the berries of the manzanita, which grow in abundance on the Valley
floor, a cider was made. These berries were also dried for winter use,
as were blackberries, raspberries, or thimbleberries, strawberries,
which, though very small, are of unusually fine flavor, currants, and
choke-cherries, which if eaten raw are everything that their name
implies. Pine-nuts were also considered a delicacy and were gathered in
large quantities for winter use.
