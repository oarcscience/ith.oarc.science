# CHAPTER VII

## THE COMING OF THE INDIAN TO YOSEMITE

The Great Spirit gathered a band of his favorite children and led them
into the mountains on a long and wearisome journey until they reached
the Valley now known as Yosemite. Here The Great Spirit bade them rest
and make their home. Here they found food in abundance for all. The
streams were swarming with fish. The meadows were thick in clover.

\[paragraph continues\] The trees and bushes gave them acorns,
pine-nuts, fruits and berries, while in the forests were herds of deer
and other animals which gave them meat and skins for food and clothing.
Here they multiplied and grew prosperous and built their villages. They
called the valley Ah-wah-nee, meaning "a deep grassy valley," and
themselves Ah-wah-nee-chees, signifying "dwellers in Ah-wah-nee."
