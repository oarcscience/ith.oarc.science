### DIVISION OF TERRITORY

They had well defined limits of territory, or boundaries, which had been
agreed upon in council by the chiefs and headmen of the different
tribes, and beyond which no Indian dared go except as a visitor or
trader. These boundaries, however, did not extend into the high Sierra,
which was held to be common hunting ground open to all the tribes.
