<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">SMALL GAME, MUSHROOMS, WORMS, AND BEETLES</H3>
<P>Small game, such as rabbits, squirrels, and birds, were killed for food, as well as for their hides and feathers, which were used in the making of arrows, bedding and clothing, and ornaments. Mushrooms and the fungus of the oak were also eaten, as were worms, grubs, beetles, and the larvae of ants and other insects.</P>
