### WIDOWS

Upon the death of a husband the widow had her hair all cut off. This was
burned with her husband's body that he might have it with him in
El-o-win as a reminder of her. Thus short hair became known as the badge
of widowhood. After the body was burned its ashes were mixed with the
rosin of the pine tree and this mixture smeared over the hands and face
of the widow. This was done as a sign of mourning, and to render her
unattractive to other men, thereby preventing any offers of remarriage
until after a suitable time had elapsed. Each year a great ceremonial
meeting was held at which the medicine man himself washed these stains
from the face and hands of the widows. If the widow wished to remain
true to the memory of her departed husband, and still feared offers of
remarriage, she was privileged to apply a new coating. This was allowed
to wear off, and as a preventative of any amorous advances was very
effective, some of them presenting a particularly hideous and repulsive
appearance. A widow was independent in the matter of marriage, but
usually when consenting to remarry was presented with gifts by her new
husband.
