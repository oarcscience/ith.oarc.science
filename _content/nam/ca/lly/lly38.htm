<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">GRASSHOPPERS</H3>
<P>Grasshoppers were a favorite food of the Indian, being regarded as a delicacy. To catch them a trench was dug across the center of a meadow and a fire built in the trench into which rocks were thrown. After the fire had burned to glowing embers the Indians formed in line on each side of the meadow and with the aid of brushes and much yelling, drove the grasshoppers into the trench, where they were automatically roasted on the hot coals and rocks. They were then eaten in that form, or crushed and beaten into a paste and mixed with other edibles. If desired for winter use they were dried in the sun and stored away in the cache. Grasshoppers were also caught and eaten raw.</P>
