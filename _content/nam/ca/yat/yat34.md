### XI. COYOTE AND THE STUMP. <span id="fr_168"></span>[345](#fn_163)

Coyote went to P‘ā'wi one day. It was early in the morning and it was
very foggy. He met some one in the trail. Coyote stooped. "Whew! I'm
tired. Where do you come from?" The man did not answer. Coyote sat down
to rest, and said, "You came early, so did I." The man said nothing.
Coyote said, "Talk! One must say something when he meets one." There was
no reply. Said Coyote, "If you are angry, say so!" No

answer. Coyote said, "If you want to fight, I can fight." Coyote got up.
There was no answer. Coyote said, "I'll hit." He did so, and his right
hand stuck. It was no man, it was a stump. Coyote said, "Let go my
hand!" with no result. Coyote hit him with his left hand; it stuck.
Coyote said, "Why do you hold my hands? Let go! That is no way to
fight." No reply. Coyote kicked with his right foot; it stuck. He kicked
with his left foot; it stuck. He butted; his head stuck. By and by a man
came along and saw Coyote. He said, "Coyote is a fool. He has been
fighting that stump."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_163"></span>[227:345](yat34.htm#fr_168) In Dr. Dixon's
manuscript this incident is immediately preceded by the story of Coyote
and Frost (see no. VII of texts). It is practically a version of the
world-wide "Tar Baby" myth. A very similar myth is told by the Takelmas.
