### XX. SPELL SAID BY A GIRL DESIROUS OF GETTING A HUSBAND.

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

S\*uwā'! <span id="fr_138"></span>[310](#fn_134) May you think about me
to yourself! May you turn back to look! Would that I might stand before
his face! I just cry to myself. Would that I might see him every day! I
do just as you do. <span id="fr_139"></span>[311](#fn_135) Sometimes I
dream of him, and I rise when it is daylight, and I look about. Now, as
I see him, my heart flutters. I look at him without raising my eyes. He
gives me trinkets, and I take them, and I wear them for some time, until
they are worn out.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_134"></span>[198:310](yat19.htm#fr_138) Spells and more or
less formulaic utterances in general are introduced by S\*uwā', of
unknown, if any, significance.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[198:311](yat19.htm#fr_139) The implication is
not clear. Perhaps it means, "May you love me as I love you!"
