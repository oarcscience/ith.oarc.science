#### *San Miguel*. <span id="fr_43"></span>[43](#fn_43)

The neophytes at this mission speak four languages: that of San Antonio,
which is reputed the principal one; that of the shore (la playana),
which is the one spoken by those settled on the coast; the Tulareño; and
another, that of the people of the south. <span

The money of the Indians has been, and still is, beads, which they now
lend without usury. In their wild state, usury consisted of the daily
augmentation of the value of the amount lent, for instance a real of
beads; and those who lent the real grew richer by as many reales as the
original real was days in returning to their hands. This custom was
practiced by those to the east of this mission. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_43"></span>[18:43](mrci10.htm#fr_43) San Miguel was in the
territory of the Indians of the so-called Salinan stock. No general name
of native origin is known for these people, who go under their present
designation only because they lived in and about Salinas valley. The
father who wrote the above reply was either Juan Martin or Juan Cabot.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[18:44](mrci10.htm#fr_44) Of the four languages,
the Tulareño is that of the people in the Tulare valley, namely the
Yokuts. The people of the south are probably the most northwesterly
Chumash, some of whom may have been brought to San Miguel instead of to
San Luis Obispo. The language of San Antonio is Salinan, and that of the
coast evidently so. Both are mentioned again in the replies from San
Antonio. Nothing is known of the coast language of this region, nor
about the dialectic divisions of the Salinan family, other than that the
dialects ordinarily called those of San Miguel and San Antonio were
somewhat different.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[18:45](mrci10.htm#fr_45) No such custom of
borrowing at interest has been otherwise reported from California.
