We know that they adore a large bird similar to a kite, which they raise
with the greatest care from the time it is young, and they hold to many
errors regarding it. <span id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23)

 

When a new moon shows itself they make a great outcry, which manifests
their interest (negosijo). If there is an eclipse of the sun or of the
moon, they shout with still louder outcries, beating the ground, skins,
or mats with sticks, which shows their concern and uneasiness. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_22"></span>[11:23](mrci04.htm#fr_22) The Indians of San
Juan Capistrano have sometimes been known as Juaneños. They speak a
dialect similar to Luiseño. It is regarding them that the missionary
Boscana has left the invaluable account that has been mentioned. The
fathers in charge of San Juan Capistrano about 1811 were Francisco Suñer
and Jose Barona.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[11:24](mrci04.htm#fr_23) The large bird similar
to a kite is no doubt the eagle or condor as among the Diegueño and
Luiseño.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[11:25](mrci04.htm#fr_24) The "outcry" at the
appearance of the new moon is more fully described by Boscana. Racing by
the young men formed a feature of the occasion. Boscana also mentions
the concern felt at the time of an eclipse.
