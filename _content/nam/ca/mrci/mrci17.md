When married people separate, the children regularly follow the mother.

As soon as a person has stopped breathing, if he has few relatives or
lazy ones, they bury him. Those who have friends or relatives who will
bring wood, are burned. The little property that they have, and some few
seeds, they burn with them, which is the more usual practice.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_66"></span>[27:66](mrci17.htm#fr_66) San Francisco was the
most northerly of the missions in Costanoan territory, and in fact the
most northerly of the Franciscan missions in California except that of
San Rafael. The missionaries in charge in 1811 were Ramon Abella and
Juan Saenz de Lucio.

<span id="fn_67"></span>[27:67](mrci17.htm#fr_67) The five languages of
this mission may have been the dialects of the five Costanoan tribes
mentioned in Schoolcraft as gathered at this mission: Olhon, Ahwaste,
Altahmo, Romonan, Tulomo.
