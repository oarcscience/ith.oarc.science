*Pomo Bear Doctors*, by S.A. Barrett, \[1917\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PANTHER DOCTORS

While the bear doctor was the most important of magicians, there were
also mountain lion or panther doctors, who were also possessed of
considerable power. Very little was learned of this class of medicine
man save that the head part of their suits was made of the head and neck
of an actual panther skin drawn over a basket frame similar to that used
by the bear doctor. The remainder of the suit was made of shredded
soaproot fiber woven on to a fine net, which was said to simulate quite
well the skin of the panther.

The panther doctor wore no bead armor as did the bear doctor, but wore a
necklace of small and finely made shell beads around his neck. He always
carried a bag filled with valuable beads with which to bribe to silence
any one who might discover him. The bear doctor used the beads
comprising his armor for this purpose.
