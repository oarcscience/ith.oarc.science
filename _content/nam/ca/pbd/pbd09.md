*Pomo Bear Doctors*, by S.A. Barrett, \[1917\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### RITES OVER THE SUIT

When the suit was put on for the first time by the bear doctor, the
following elaborate ceremony was performed. The assistant took up his
position in the center of the practice ground, having on one side of him
four hundred counting sticks, each about the size of a lead pencil,
nicely arranged in even rows. Directly in front of him was the entire
bear doctor 's suit, except the beads and bead belts; that is, the
basketry helmet, the bearskin garment, the two water baskets, the dagger
of elk antler, and the obsidian knife. These were the articles which
were strictly ceremonial, and which must never be handled by women or
children for the reason that they were the property of the particular
supernatural beings under whose patronage the bear doctor operated and
whose powers were invoked for his success, especially by means of a long
series of ritualistic songs sung by his assistant during the ceremony of
donning the suit, now to be described.

While the assistant sang the ritualistic songs, the bear doctor who was
to wear the suit danced up toward it four times each from each of the
four cardinal points in the following order: north, west, south, and
east. Each time the dancer advanced toward the suit, the singer raised
above his head one counter from the one side and as the dancer receded
placed it on his opposite side. Thus this portion of the ceremony took
sixteen counters. Having thus approached the suit four times the sacred
number four, the dancer picked up with his left hand the basketry helmet
and danced with it four times around the practice ground, the singer
keeping tally with the necessary four sticks. He then danced four times
up toward and back from the place on the practice ground where he
intended to temporarily place this object, so using another four
counters. Thus there were used in all with this one object twenty-four
counters.

He did precisely the same with each of the remaining five articles of
the suit. Thus one hundred and forty-four counters were transferred from
the original group to the singers opposite side.

<span id="page_459">p. 459</span>

He next took all six of these articles in both hands and performed the
same cycle of twenty-four dance movements that was employed in handling
each separately, so using one hundred and sixty-eight counters up to
this point.

He then repeated this entire cycle of one hundred and sixty-eight dance
movements in precisely the same order and manner as just described, but
using the right hand instead of the left, thus using three hundred and
thirty-six counters up to this point.

He next repeated all the foregoing movements exactly in reverse order in
every respect; taking up the articles in reverse order and dancing
toward the cardinal points in reverse order and using the hands in
reverse order, thus using six hundred and seventy-two counters up to
this point.

He finally took the entire suit in both hands and went around the
practice ground four times in a clockwise direction and then four times
in a contra-clockwise direction, thus using in all six hundred and
eighty counters, indicative of that number of separate movements, or
rather one hundred and seventy distinct types of movements each repeated
four times.

Throughout this entire ceremony the assistant sang ritualistic songs
invoking, in the ascending order of their importance, the aid of the
particular supernatural beings under whose patronage the bear doctor was
supposed to be and with whom he came into direct contact. According to
one informant, these were, in order, brush-man, rock-man, shade-man,
spring-man, pond-man, mountain-man, and sun-man, though a large number
of others are also included. <span id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16) In
fact, it seems probable that all the spirits of the Pomo world are
supposed to be directly concerned. The following were specifically
mentioned by the informants:

To all these he sang songs and made prayers the substance of which
usually was: "You know what I am doing. I am doing as you do and using
your ways. You must help me and give me good luck."

He sang to and invoked particularly Sun-man because he was an all-seeing
deity and knew everything that happened all over the earth, and more
particularly because as Sun-man rises with the sun each morning lie
comes with his bow and arrow drawn and ready to shoot on sight any
wrongdoer. Unless, therefore, Sun-man was propitiated and previously
informed of the bear doctor's intentions, he was likely to shoot him
just as the sun appeared above the horizon. The substance of his prayer
to Sun-man was: "I am going to do as you do. I shall kill people. You
must give me good luck.

When the suit was finally put on there was a certain amount of
ceremonial procedure. The beads used as armor were first put on the
naked body. The arms and legs were closely wound, each with a single
long string of beads. The bear doctor then danced around the practice
ground four times in a clockwise direction and then four times in a
contra-clockwise direction. He next advanced toward and receded from the
suit four times each from the north, west, south, and east. He then made
four times a motion as if to pick up the suit, and again four times the
motion of putting the suit on, after which he donned it and was
completely ready for his journey, being endowed with all the
supernatural powers of the bear doctor.

Throughout the entire construction of the suit, and also throughout the
ceremony connected with putting it on, he turned his head around toward
the left after each separate action, such as lifting up or putting down
any article and after each dancing up and back toward the suit, or
running around the practice ground.

Each subsequent donning of the suit was quite simple. The bear

<span id="page_461">p. 461</span>

doctor picked up each article separately and made a motion with it four
times toward the part of the body it was to cover, turning his head four
times to the left after each of these sets of four motions. He then put
on the suit and danced in a contra-clockwise direction four times around
the practice area or the interior of his cavern, as the case might be,
after which he was fully ready for his journey.

In case of inclement weather the bear doctor dressed in the shelter of
the cavern, but if the weather was fair this was always done on the
practice ground.

In undressing, on the other hand, the bear doctor performed no ceremony
at all, but simply took off his suit and carefully laid it away, hanging
up in the cavern the bearskin itself to keep it clean. It was necessary
that a bear doctor swim immediately upon removing his suit. Still
dressed in his bead armor, he went, therefore, to his swimming place,
removing the beads and piling them on the bank. This was done so that if
discovered he had immediately at hand a treasure with which to buy
secrecy. The penalty paid by an informer who had been thus bribed was
certain death at the hands of the bear doctor. Upon emerging from the
pool, he returned to his cavern, carefully folded the belts and strings
of beads and laid each away separately until the suit was again needed.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_16"></span>[459:17](pbd09.htm#fr_16) Another informant gave
as these chief spirits sun-man, mountain-man, wind-man, night-man,
water-man, and valley-man, though not stating that they were considered
in this order.
