This is a monograph on a typical variety of native Californian
shamanism, the animal-impersonator. This describes the practice among
the Pomo, a Northern Californian people. Despite the title 'Bear
Doctor,' these shamans did not cure: they were berserkers, as befits
their totem, with a license to kill up to four people per year. Topics
include how they fit into Pomo Creation mythology, initiation rituals
and comparisons with other Northern Californian groups.
