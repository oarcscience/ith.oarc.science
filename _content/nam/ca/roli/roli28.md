### STAR LORE AND CALENDAR.

The stars were those of the First People who went up into the sky in the
attempt to escape from death when it became known that the death of
Ouiot had brought death to all upon earth.

In the old times much more was known about the stars than at present.
Songs remain containing the names of stars which cannot now be
identified. It is possible that the motions of the planets were
recognized, but today Venus seems to be the only one distinguished by a
special name. Venus is Aylucha, <span id="fr_312"></span>[296](#fn_306)
that which is left over from evening till morning, food or anything of
the kind.

Only the most important stars have names. They were the chiefs among the
First People, and they took their parties of adherents or relatives with
them, which are now the stars grouped about the chief star, but without
individual names.

The associated stars form much larger groups than those which we have
adopted from antiquity; and when the Luiseño system is understood, there
is something more impressive in it than in the haphazard arrangement of
the Greeks and Romans. The oldest and most important star-chiefs, those
most often mentioned, are Nükülish, Antares, and Yungavish (buzzard),
Altair. The right hand of Antares, Nükülish po-ma, Nükülish his-hand, is
Arcturus. Rising always in advance of Antares, it heralds his coming.
All the other stars grouped around and between are the people of
Antares, a large following.

In the same way Yungavish po-ma, the right hand of Altair, is Vega. The
feather headdress of Altair, Pecheya Yungavish, <span
id="fr_313"></span>[297](#fn_307) is a star close to and immediately
above it.

The Luiseños regard the Milky Way as the spirit, the home of our
spirits, to which they are sent when leaving the earth. The long series
of songs of Kwinamish define their beliefs concerning the spirit. These
songs are extremely difficult of interpretation and explanation, for
they include words unused in ordinary life, and ideas that would have
been puzzling in the old days to any but the initiated. The instruction
concerning the things of the

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

spirit given to the candidate in the toloache ceremony, as explained by
the symbol Wanawut, has already been referred to. The exact character of
this can never be discovered; nor in just what manner it symbolizes
these ideas.

One of the songs of Kwinamish, already given, begins: Tomamik Yula
Wanawut poponakala ponyarakala auma, to the north the spirit in
carefully woven strings remains tied. The striking peculiarity in the
Luiseño use of sacred terms, the doubling of the word, has been referred
to. Wanal Wanawut has been explained. Yula Wanawut has almost exactly
the same significance. Yula means spirit, and literally head or hair. It
is possible that in ancient times the object Wanawut was made of hair,
as were the bracelets and anklets used in the girls’ ceremony. In the
creation myth one of the first states of existence, out of which Earth
and Sky came by successive transitions, was called Whaikut Piwkut,
explained as something silvery gray, like the glimmering of dawn or the
gray hair of old age. In one of the earlier notes made, the explanation
identifies Whaikut Piwkut with the Milky Way. It is possible that
Whaikut Piwkut was the pre-existing form of the Milky Way, which in that
case would have preeminence over Earth and Sky. Its silvery glimmer is
suggested by the term; hut all this is involved in uncertainty.

The other chiefs of the first people now seen as stars of the first
magnitude are Waonesh, <span id="fr_314"></span>[298](#fn_308) Spica;
Nawiwit Chawachwish, <span id="fr_315"></span>[299](#fn_309) Fomalhaut;
and Tukmishwut, <span id="fr_316"></span>[300](#fn_310) the North star.
Hulaish <span id="fr_317"></span>[301](#fn_311) is Orion, and
Chehaiyam <span id="fr_318"></span>[302](#fn_312) the Pleiades. These
two are always named together.

Tukmishwut, the North star, <span id="fr_319"></span>[303](#fn_313)
remains motionless, and all his people, the members of his "party," move
in a circle about him. This is the reason the dancing and marching are
in a circle around the sacred enclosure, the fire, and so on. His hand
and heart are both to be seen in the sky. The outlines of these figures,
traced

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

in tiny sixth-magnitude stars, are only to be seen in an atmosphere
entirely free from moisture as well as from clouds. Three fingers are
outlined, the blunt one having been bitten off; and the heart is placed
among them, its point reaching to the horizon beneath. Albañas's
grandfather taught him the outlines of this constellation of the North
star in the evenings when the little boy sat by the hearth fire, tracing
the figure in the sparks of little live coals upon the earth floor of
the hut ([fig. 3](#img_fig03)) .

At the time when the stars went up in the sky to escape death, the
Pleiades, Chehaiyam, were seven young women, sisters; and when they went
up a rope was let down for them to climb on.

Coyote came along, and as there was no man with them he said, "I will go
with you, girls." They did not answer him, but he took hold of the rope
and kept on going up after them. But when they were safely up, they cut
the rope and Coyote fell backwards. There is always a star following
them, Aldebaran, and this is Coyote.

Orion went up at the same time.

The eclipse of the moon is the physical manifestation of Ouiot's
sickness when he counted the months expecting to die. When the eclipse
clears off, Moyla, Ouiot, gets well again.

At the time of the eclipse they sing the songs of Pikmakvul.

The moon was sent up into the sky to watch the people and regulate
everything, and all goes according to the moon. Especially is this so in
regard to women who have their menses, but men are also affected by it,
and become strong or weak as the moon waxes and wanes

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

Mr. F. S. Sparkman in his unpublished dictionary of the Luiseño language
says:

"The Luiseño year was divided into eight periods, each of which was
again divided into two parts. Periods of time were not represented by
these divisions, which merely indicated when certain fruits and ripened,
grass began to grow, trees came into leaf in the valley, or on the
mountain, etc.

"The following are the divisions of the year:

<div align="center">

|                                                |                                           |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">Tasmoi-mal alu’mal</span>  | <span class="small">Tasmoyil mokat</span> |
| <span class="small">Tauna-mal alu’mal</span>   | <span class="small">Tawut mokat</span>    |
| <span class="small">Tausun-mal alu’mal</span>  | <span class="small">Tausanal mokat</span> |
| <span class="small">Tovuk-mal alu’mal</span>   | <span class="small">Tovakal mokat</span>  |
| <span class="small">Nova’no-mal alu’mal</span> | <span class="small">Novanut mokat</span>  |
| <span class="small">Pahoi-mal alu’mal</span>   | <span class="small">Pahoyil mokat</span>  |
| <span class="small">Nemoi-mal alu’mal</span>   | <span class="small">Nemoyil mokat</span>  |
| <span class="small">Somoi-mal alu’mal</span>   | <span class="small">Somoyil mokat</span>  |

</div>

"It will be seen that the first word of the name given to the first part
of each period has the diminutive suffix -mal affixed to it, while the
second word of the name, alu’mal, means thin or lean. Therefore this
means something like the small lean part of the period. Mokat, the
second word of the name given to the second part of each period, means
large, therefore the second parts are spoken of as the large parts. But
it is not necessary to use the words alu’mal and mokat; the other words
may be used alone.

It has been impossible to ascertain exactly what periods of the year are
represented by these divisions; informants reply differently."

The names of these "months" are all taken from the physical features of
different seasons. Tausunmal, August, means everything is brown and
sear. Tovukmal refers to the little streams of water washing the fallen
leaves. Tasmoimal means that the rain has come and grass is sprouting.
In Nemoimal the deer grow fat. The "months" are marked by the rising of
certain magnitude stars counted in the early morning. <span

<span id="fn_314"></span>[165:304](roli28.htm#fr_320) The Diegueño year
was divided into six months and the morning rising of five chief stars
was noted. The names of the months are: Hutlnamashap, Hutltai, Hutlpswi,
Hutlkwurx, Hutlmatanai, Hutlanaxa.

The Diegueño constellations are altogether different from the Luiseño,
and based upon totally different ideas. It has not been possible to
secure an accurate account of them; but it seems that there is no one
consistent idea to account for them as with the Luiseños, whose superior
intellectuality is shown in their power of generalization; but it is
probable that with the Diegueños as with us, they represent each a
different myth concept.

Orion is called Mu in Manzanita Diegueño, Emu at Mesa Grande, the word
meaning mountain sheep. This apt name is given from the perfectly
defined horns of the mountain sheep which can be traced on one side of
the constellation as we see it, in tiny stars.

It is said that Scorpio is with the Diegueños a boy with a bow and
arrow.

The Diegueño conception of the Milky Way was probably adopted by them
from the Luiseños along with the rest of the Chungichnish religion.
