### LUISEÑO CREATION.

Fourth Version—By Lucario Cuevish. <span
id="fr_209"></span>[194](#fn_204)

The first that came or appeared was Kivish, the man, Atakvish, the
woman. <span id="fr_210"></span>[195](#fn_205)

Then Omai, the man, Yamai, the woman. <span
id="fr_211"></span>[196](#fn_206)

When the two beings found themselves there, realized the existence of
each other, the brother and sister each said to the other, "Who are
you?"

The man called her sister. But when the thought of marrying her came to
him, he changed the form of address and spoke to her in a different way.
The woman asked, "Who are you?"

He answered, "Kivish no, Kivish no, Kivish no, Han-n-n-n-n. (I am
Kivish, I am Kivish, I am Kivish, groan used in sacred narrative and
ceremonies)."

The man asked, "What have you to say?"

She answered, "Atakvish no, Atakvish no, Atakvish no, Han-n-n-n."

The inquiries being repeated, he said, "Omai no, Omai no, Omai no,
Han-n-n-n."

She said, "Yamai no, Yamai no, Yamai no, Han-n-n-n."

There was now a transition impossible to explain.

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

Whaikut Piwkut was the man, the sky or Milky Way, whitish-gray. Harurai
Chatutai <span id="fr_212"></span>[197](#fn_207) was the woman, the
earth.

Another transition and they became Tukmit, the sky, Tomaiyowit, the
earth. These came after and from the previous states of existence, but
were not born of them as their children.

The woman lay extended, her feet to the north, her head to the south.
Her brother sat on the right hand by her side. "Sister, you must say who
you are," he said. She answered, "I am Tomaiyowit." She asked, "Who are
you?" He answered, "I am Tukmit." Tomaiyowit now, in a marvelous
recitative, enumerates her attributes which it is distinctly explained
do not belong to her but are prophetic of the completed state of being
which is to come later. <span id="fr_213"></span>[198](#fn_208)

"Non Obkit, non Opaykit, I am that which stretches out flat or is
extended (from horizon to horizon). <span
id="fr_214"></span>[199](#fn_209)

"Non Yaramul, non Kworamul, I am that which shakes, and sounds with a
loud noise, like thunder. <span id="fr_215"></span>[200](#fn_210)

"Non Yinkit, non Yenankit, <span id="fr_216"></span>[201](#fn_211) I am
the earthquake.

"Non Punkit, non Choykit, <span id="fr_217"></span>[202](#fn_212) I am
that which rolls around and is round in shape.

"Non Manakit, <span id="fr_218"></span>[203](#fn_213) I am that which
goes out of sight and appears again." *After things were in shape it
would be this way*.

Then Tukmit spoke:

"Non Tukmit, non Pamkit, I am that which arches over like a round lid or
cover. <span id="fr_219"></span>[204](#fn_214)

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

"Non Yumkit, same meaning. <span id="fr_220"></span>[205](#fn_215)

"Non Hetkit, non Kariamul, I am something that goes up high, and will
rise high. <span id="fr_221"></span>[206](#fn_216)

"Non Somkit, non Paikit, I am death, that which will devour as if by
taking all in, in one bite. <span id="fr_222"></span>[207](#fn_217)

"Non Hakwit, non Lamkit, I am he that from the east catches the spirits
of men and sends them away off.

"Non Wokumal, non Chorumal, <span id="fr_223"></span>[208](#fn_218) I am
death." <span id="fr_224"></span>[209](#fn_219)

They said all this while she lay there and he sat by her side. It was in
darkness, but he felt her and took her right hand. "What part of your
body is this?" "That is my right hand." "And this?" "My left hand." In
the same way he felt and she named her head, hair, the parting of the
hair, the skull, the temple, brows, eyelids, cheek bones, teeth, etc.
This is an extremely long enumeration, ending in that part of the story
which the narrator omits from motives of delicacy, but which Boscana
gives briefly in his version of the same myth among the San Juan
Capistrano Indians as follows: "The brother wished to marry the sister
but she resisted, reminding him of their affinity. In due time, however,
they were married."

She was with child and so large that she must lie down, falling
backwards. She looked for something to help her, and Tukmit to deliver
her took Sivut paviut, the sacred stick with flint knife inserted in the
end of it, and with this he cut her open from between the breasts
downward. (Groaning recitative.) Then came forth her children in the
order of their birth.

1\. *Yula Nahut*. Yula, spirit, literally, hair; nahut possibly should
be wanawut. Yula wanawut is the sacred string used in connection with
the toloache ceremony and sand-painting. <span
id="fr_225"></span>[210](#fn_220)

2\. *Chakwut Wakut*. Chakwut, a woven basket carried on the end of a
cane by the men and used to cover the faces of the girls

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

to keep the flies from them <span id="fr_226"></span>[211](#fn_221) in
their puberty ceremony. <span id="fr_227"></span>[212](#fn_222) Wakut,
curved throwing stick for killing rabbits. <span
id="fr_228"></span>[213](#fn_223)

3\. *Nosish Ayaraka*. Nosish, the red scum on iron springs. This was
sacred because it was skimmed off, burnt, and used for red paint in the
sand-painting and elsewhere. Ayaraka, the green scum, fresh-water algae,
that appears on water when Tomaiyowit, the Earth-mother, has her
menses. <span id="fr_229"></span>[214](#fn_224)

4\. *Pala Yowhala*. Pala, water; yowhala, mud. <span
id="fr_230"></span>[215](#fn_225)

5\. *Ushla Pikla*. Ushla, wild roses; pikla, wild blackberry. Almost
all, if not all, thorny, stinging things belonged to Chungichnish, being
his avengers. <span id="fr_231"></span>[216](#fn_226)

6\. *Nenexel Pachayel*. Nenexel is a brush that grows on the mountains;
pachayel is a sedge or plant that grows in wet places, the root of which
makes large clumps. <span id="fr_232"></span>[217](#fn_227) They were
sacred because they were the plants used in the girls’ ceremony to cover
them with or to line the hole, or both.

7\. *Simut*, double not given. Simut is salt grass on the
seashore. <span id="fr_233"></span>[218](#fn_228)

8\. *Poöla Poaskatu*. Both words mean menses. <span
id="fr_234"></span>[219](#fn_229)

These were the first born. Then came forth all the hills, trees, stones,
rocks, and everything that we now see on the earth, but all were people
then. There were born, not given as doubles:

9\. *Hunal*, the badger.

10\. *Yungavish*, the buzzard, and meaning also the star Altair.

11\. *Takwish*, the large meteor sometimes seen in the daytime, Diegueño
Chaup or Shiwiw.

12\. *Choruwut*, an underground animal that has never been seen, but
which can be heard growling and shaking the stones in certain places in
the mountains. <span id="fr_235"></span>[220](#fn_230)

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

13\. *Towish*, the spirit. When a man dies he becomes Towish. <span
id="fr_236"></span>[221](#fn_231)

14\. *Kwila*, an oak tree with edible acorns. <span
id="fr_237"></span>[222](#fn_232)

15\. *Pauhwhut Abawhut*. Pauhwhut, a painted board about four feet long,
kept hidden in the house. If anyone is sick, punished by Chungichnish,
they get it out and lay it on the ground in ceremonies. <span
id="fr_238"></span>[223](#fn_233) Abauhwhut or Abawhut, definition
obscure.

16\. *Kimul Chehenish*, <span id="fr_239"></span>[224](#fn_234)
definition given obscure.

17\. *Poblish*, a tree. <span id="fr_240"></span>[225](#fn_235)

18\. *Isla*, a person. <span id="fr_241"></span>[226](#fn_236)

19\. *Masla*, a fern. <span id="fr_242"></span>[227](#fn_237)

Then came forth the avengers and special messengers of Chungichnish.

20\. *Sowut*, the "black" rattlesnake. <span
id="fr_243"></span>[228](#fn_238)

21\. *Mekus*, the "yellow" rattlesnake. <span
id="fr_244"></span>[229](#fn_239)

22\. The spider.

23\. *Palahush*, the tarantula. <span id="fr_245"></span>[230](#fn_240)

24\. *Awialut*, the raven. <span id="fr_246"></span>[231](#fn_241)

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

25\. *Hunwut*, the bear.

26\. *Wulamul*, the stingaree. <span id="fr_247"></span>[232](#fn_242)

Then the sacred objects:

27\. *Tukmul*, the flat winnowing basket sacred to Chungichnish, placed
upon the ground in the ceremonies.

28\. *Somkul Papawish*. Somkul, urine; papawish, mock-orange plant, also
called Näxish. <span id="fr_248"></span>[233](#fn_243) These two names
make a double because in the ceremonies when the stone bowls and so on
were placed upon the ground, urine was sprinkled over them with the
branch of the mock-orange plant. <span id="fr_249"></span>[234](#fn_244)

29\. *Topal Tamyush*. <span id="fr_250"></span>[235](#fn_245)

The raven was the especial messenger of Chungichnish and was able to
tell the secret transgressions of those who offended against him,
revealed the secrets, made mistakes in the ceremonies, or disobeyed the
rules of life; but it was not everyone who could hear what the raven
said. It was only the shamans of greatest power, those who could hear
and see everything and kill a person at a distance.

Tukmit and Tomaiyowit now made the land, only a small piece at first.
Then later they made it larger just as it is now. Everything now came
into shape just as it had been named and planned in the conversation
between Tukmit and Tomaiyowit. Everything was all in the dark. The First
People could just feel each other but could see nothing.

They traveled east till they came to Epyuvokala Putwalakala, a place
that was just like a blank wall in front of them; <span
id="fr_251"></span>[236](#fn_246) so they turned around and came back to
the same place.

Then they came to Kawima <span id="fr_252"></span>[237](#fn_247)
Putlalak, <span id="fr_253"></span>[238](#fn_248) near San Bernardino,
where they got to a cañon that they could not go through. <span
id="fr_254"></span>[239](#fn_249)

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Then they came
along by Elsinore, and stopped there, and made the lake that is
there. <span id="fr_255"></span>[240](#fn_250) They traveled as far as
Temecula, called Ekva Temeko, and stopped by a small lake that used to
be there, but it is drained out and dried up now.

Then they began to think, to gain consciousness, and could now talk to
each other, and discuss what it was best to do. Now Hainit <span
id="fr_256"></span>[241](#fn_251) Yuinit <span
id="fr_257"></span>[242](#fn_252) made the sun. This means something way
down in the ground. <span id="fr_258"></span>[243](#fn_253)

This man, when he made the sun, took the reddish milkweed plant that
twine is made of, and twisted the fibres of it into twine, and out of
that made a net, not an ordinary carrying net, but a long one. Then he
called all the people and they got together in a place near
Temecula. <span id="fr_259"></span>[244](#fn_254) He took the net that
was all rolled up, and with groaning invocation he laid it on the
ground, and all the people standing in a circle bent over and placed it
before them on the ground. They sang about Temet, the sun, and putting
him in the net, they raised their arms with the appropriate groans,
cries, and gestures, and sent him up into the sky as the sun:

Temet kwon na num, temet kwon na num, temet kwon na num, han-han-n,
han-n-n.

He went to the north, but that was not right and they placed him in the
net again.

(Same recitative, words slightly varied.)

He went south, but came back again.

(Same recitative, groans, and gestures.)

He went west, but went a little way and came down again.

Temet kwon put ya, temet kwon put ya, temet kwon put ya, han-n-n, wahha,
wahha, wah-ha-a.

They sent him east, and he went up in the sky and away off. (Expressive
gestures, arms raised towards the sky.)

(Another recitative invocation). They made it so that he

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

would not follow in a straight line, but work southward or northward at
different seasons of the year.

Song, Temet karia. The sun should rise. <span
id="fr_260"></span>[245](#fn_255)

He rose. All was light, and the people could see each other.

Tukmit said that some of the children should go north, others east,
south, and west. So he divided them in this way. They had had only one
language, but when they scattered he gave them different languages. He
also gave them their religion. He sent the Diegueños and others south
with their language, and to the west he sent those of Capistrano, and so
on, with their language, and in the center he left us (the Mountain
Luiseños), with one language from Temecula to La Jolla.

Before the people, the tribes, were scattered north, south, east, and
west, Moyla, <span id="fr_261"></span>[246](#fn_256) Ouiot, was there.
Because he disliked the shape of Wahawut, the frog, she killed him. He
only thought about her, but as she was a witch she could tell his
thoughts; so Ouiot got sick and called his people from the north to
come. He was very sick, and when they came they tried to find out what
was the matter. They were witches and thought that they could cure him,
but they could not tell what was the matter. Then the people from the
east, south, and west came and did the same thing.

Ouiot got worse, and was paralyzed so that he could not walk, but
crawled around and grew worse and worse. The hawk, Mawhala, <span
id="fr_262"></span>[247](#fn_257) came to doctor Ouiot, and he was the
only one who could tell what was the matter with him. He said that
Wahawut was killing him by witchcraft. Then the people found out that
Wahawut was doing that.

Ouiot knew now that he was going to die, and he mentioned all the
"months" in a series, saying in each that perhaps he would die in that
one. The last one, Soymamul, meant that he would die and take all with
him (in death).

Chehemal was a good man, and Ouiot had confidence in him, so he called
him and told him that he would come back in three days. After he died,
all his people were gathered there and they

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

did not know what to do, whether to burn or bury him. They decided to
burn the body. The kangaroo-rat lost no time but went to work, and kept
himself busy making a carrying net in which to lift Ouiot. An old woman,
now the glow-worm, had some fire hidden under her arm. They first of all
dug a shallow hole and put wood in it. Coyote was always a mean sort of
fellow, and the people suspected him and made an excuse to send him away
while they burned the body. So they called him and told him he was the
quickest man and he must go north to get some fire. He did not want to
leave. Se he started to where the First People lived in the north. But
he did not go all the way, only ran a little way and came back, saying
he could not get any fire there. So they sent him in turn to the people
in the east, south, and west, but he came back each time without any
fire. There was a big log lying there which a dozen men could not lift.
When Coyote had gone off, Wiskun, now the chipmunk, went out and got the
log, singing a groaning recitative, lifted it, and carried it over to
where Ouiot was. As soon as they got it ready, the kangaroo-rat brought
his net, and they put Ouiot in it, and he carried it over to the place
of the burning. He could hardly walk but staggered under his load. Then
they took half of the log, slightly hollowed out, mavakal, and laid
Ouiot on it. He had no clothes, but upon his breast was laid the dressed
and decorated skin of the crow (raven?). Over him they put the other
slightly hollowed piece, avakal. They started the fire, and while it was
burning they stood close together around it so that Coyote could not
reach the body. The badger was a little man and he was standing there in
the circle. The body was burned all but the heart, and when Coyote got
there he ran around the circle stretching himself and peering over to
see what he could do. Then he ran back to get a start, took a running
jump forward over their heads, got the heart, and ran off with it in his
mouth. They clubbed him well, but he got it just the same. Then when
everything was burned, they gathered the bones and held a council to
decide what they should do.

The eagle was a very wise man and he knew a great deal; and he thought
he would go north to try to get away from death, as he found there was
to be death after Ouiot died. When he

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

went north he found that death was there, and east, south, and west the
same. When he came back he told the people that death was everywhere. It
was very close. They had all to die. He sang this at Temecula. <span
id="fr_263"></span>[248](#fn_258)

Then they wanted to kill the deer, but he said, No, that was not right,
for he was just the same as they were. They told him they would kill him
with the sacred stones. He said, No, he had the same. Then they got a
stone arrow-straightener and said they would kill him with that. He
said, No, he had that too. They said they had the feathers for the
head-dresses and would kill him with them. He said, No, he had some of
them too. They showed him arrowheads and said they would kill him with
them. He said, No, he had those also. They showed him a bow and said
they would kill him with that. Deer said he also had that. They told him
they had sinew and would kill him with that. He said, No, he had that
too. They told him they would kill him with blood. Deer said, No, he had
that. They told him they would kill him with the tracks of their
footprints. He said, No, some of those were his too. They told him they
would kill him with marrow. Deer said, No, he also had marrow. They told
him they would kill him with their ears. He said they could not do that.
He had ears too. They told him they would kill him with their eyes. He
said, No, he had eyes too. They told him they would kill him with the
skin of the deer's head and antlers worn on the head by the hunter to
deceive the deer. He said, No, he had that too. They told him they would
kill him with tobacco. He said, No. He had some of that too. They told
him they would kill him with wood-ticks. He said, No, he had those also.
They told him they would kill him with one of the big blue-flies. He
said, No, he had that too. Then at last he gave up when they told him
they would kill him with the feathers that wing the arrows.

So they killed the deer, and all the different kinds of rabbits.

Then the valley quail and mountain quail and road-runner and woodpecker
mourned and cut their hair for mourning. <span
id="fr_264"></span>[249](#fn_259) They were the first to do this, and
the Indians still mourn in this

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

way in some places, cutting their hair for the dead. Chehemel, kingbird,
was the only one that knew that Ouiot was coming back, and when the day
came he got on his housetop and said, "Ouiot is coming." Some of the
people said, "How can that be? He is dead." Kingbird said: "Come. Look
in the east. Karia Ouiot, Ouiot Moyla, Rises Ouiot, Ouiot the moon." All
came out and saw him in the west. Kingbird alone saw him in the east.
All shouted out, and every time after that when they saw the new moon
they would start a fire and have races.

<span id="fn_231"></span>[142:221](roli16.htm#fr_236) The Catholic
Indians, learning of the devil, identified him with Towish and still
have songs and charms drawn on the ground as a form of exorcism, but
these are modern and not genuinely Indian. The primitive Luiseños and
Diegueños appear to have had no idea in any way approaching this. They
seem to have learned their fear of Takwish, the meteor, from the
Cahuillas, though this is not certain. They sometimes combine the names,
Towish Takwish. The Chungichnish religion was a religion of fear, as its
exacting ceremonial if not obeyed would bring punishment from the many
avengers of Chungichnish, but it does not seem that this fear was ever
concentrated in one being until the priests taught them to identify
'Towish' with 'devil.' The old narrator has separated his double names
in this part, and has perhaps forgotten some. As all the sacred and
ceremonial objects were first-born people, it is no wonder that each
narrator gives a different list and forgets many.

Touch, given by Boscana, pronounced To-ush, is not far from Towish.
Boscana defines the word as "devil" which is the modern Indian
significance of Towish, the original meaning being spirit. Tacuieh, as
given by Boscana, defined as meteoric appearance, is evidently a
misprint for Tacuich, pronounced Takwish.
