<p>Among the people living near El Toro, there was a boy who was always hunting rabbits, quail, and the like with bow and arrows. One day, near Santa Ana, he saw a rabbit which he tried to catch, but it ran into a hole in the ground. He got a stick and poked in the hole.

<p>So he went on, and finally came to a place where those Chungichnish were living. They all said, "Witte,"&#151;"Welcome"&#151;to him, and told him to sit down.

<p>no heat, and after standing there awhile he came out unharmed. They all shouted and said, "Now you are a good Chungichnish."</p>  
<p>This is the reason people dance in that way, jumping and moving about.</p>
