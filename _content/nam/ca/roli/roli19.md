### NAHACHISH. <span id="fr_275"></span>[260](#fn_270)

One of the Temecula people was called Nahachish. He was a chief. He used
to have in his house the limb of a tree cut into a hook and fastened up
to hang food on. Some people broke the hook down. He became so poor that
he had nothing to eat, and did not know what to do. He sang a
song. <span id="fr_276"></span>[261](#fn_271) He sang that he was going
to leave that part of the country, but he did not know where to go.

He went to Picha Awanga, Pichanga, <span
id="fr_277"></span>[262](#fn_272) between Temecula and Warner's Ranch,
and named that place. There were a lot of people there having a fiesta,
and there was plenty of food. They passed everything to him, and there
was a sort of mush of a light gray color. So he said, "My stomach is
picha." So they called the place by that name.

Then he went over the mountain at George Cook's to Palomar mountain.
There was no one there. The houses were empty. He stood looking and
peering about, and could see no one. So he called the place
Chikuli. <span id="fr_278"></span>[263](#fn_273)

Then he went to a place, Poyarak, <span
id="fr_279"></span>[264](#fn_274) where some of his family lived. They
gave him so much to eat that he got sick and called the place
Sukishva, <span id="fr_280"></span>[265](#fn_275) nettle. "My stomach is
nettle," burns, he said. He was so poor that he did nothing but go from
place to place to get something to eat.

There is a place below here where he washed his hands, and called it
Kaiyawahuna. <span id="fr_281"></span>[266](#fn_276) He did this on a
flat rock where one

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

can still see his footprints, and see where he knelt on the soft rock.
There are footprints of deer there too.

He came to La Jolla and called it Huyama; <span
id="fr_282"></span>[267](#fn_277) and the place next to that he called
Namila. <span id="fr_283"></span>[268](#fn_278) He went in a
ravine <span id="fr_284"></span>[269](#fn_279) and called it
Sovoyama, <span id="fr_285"></span>[270](#fn_280) because it felt
chilly.

He made a sort of whistling noise and called the next place Puma. <span
id="fr_286"></span>[271](#fn_281)

He saw people feasting when his stomach was empty, and called that place
Yapichi, <span id="fr_287"></span>[272](#fn_282) where the government
Indian schoolhouse at Yapichi now is.

When he came to where Mendelhall lives now, the people were eating. He
had a good meal there and called the place Tumka. <span
id="fr_288"></span>[273](#fn_283)

In the cañon he drank water and called it Pala, water, and Pame, little
water. <span id="fr_289"></span>[274](#fn_284)

He went on and came to Rincon. It was muddy there and he called it
Yohama. <span id="fr_290"></span>[275](#fn_285)

He came to Bear Valley, where he fainted from hunger. He called it
Nakwama. <span id="fr_291"></span>[276](#fn_286)

He came to the water. He had something with him in a basket, and this he
threw out, and it still grows there in the water, a sort of greens,
called Mawut.

Then he went below Pala to a place where they ground pinole for him so
fine that he could not handle it, and was disappointed. They mixed it
with poison to kill him. It made him sick, and he traveled toward home.
He died on the way, and turned into a rock which still stands near
Temecula, two or three miles south.

They say that a priest once went out and baptized this rock because the
people told him it was a man.
