### THE WALKING TAMYUSH.

The Tamyush, sacred stone bowls, were never made. They were among the
first people, born of the Earth-mother. If the chief in whose charge
they are, does not take good care of them they go away.

They have been seen going along the road, and one can follow their track
in the dust. It is like a rattlesnake track, but broader.

At Pichanga one lately came there. A raven was seen flying along above
the road, and every now and then he swooped down as if following some
object. A man went to see what was there, and found the Tamyush. It had
been coming along the road to Pichanga. He took it to his home and they
had a big ceremony over it. The man is dead now.
