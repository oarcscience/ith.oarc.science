<p>Among the Luise&ntilde;os the relation of ceremonial songs to distinct series with special meanings and uses can still be clearly traced. The most important of these series were used in the Image ceremony, as has been stated above. The complete list, as far as obtained,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_64"></A><A HREF="#fn_61"><FONT SIZE="1">57</FONT></A> may be given as follows:</p>  
<p>Pikmakvul series, songs of death.</p>  
<p>Temenganesh series, songs of seasons.</p>  
<p>Chum Towi or Kwinamish series, songs of the spirit. Kamalum series, songs of the First People.</p>  
<p>Kish series, songs of the house.</p>  
<p>Nokwanish series, songs in memory of the dead.</p>  
<p>Totowish series, songs of the Chungichnish avengers.</p>  
<p>Munival series, songs of landmarks.</p>  
<p>Nyachish series, songs of people cursing their enemies.</p>  
<p>Anut series, songs of the ant-ordeal, now used in other ceremonies.</p>  
<p>Sungamish, the finishing songs.</p>  
<p>Topasish, men's dance songs.</p>  
<p>Then the songs of the individual for lesser ceremonial occasions, shaman's songs for rain-making, for fair weather; for harvest; for good luck, doctoring; bad luck, death to enemies; for deeds of wonder as instruction to boys, and so on. These include songs of Chatish, songs of Numkish, songs of Tuknish, all of which are Chungichnish songs.</p>  
<p>For the benefit of the special student who may be interested, a description of those obtained on graphophone records follows:</p>  
<p>Record 369.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_65"></A><A HREF="#fn_62"><FONT SIZE="1">58</FONT></A> Song of Temenganesh, Songs of Seasons.

I have mentioned all the names of the seasons and stars</p>

It mentions the water and mud in which are Wahawut, the frog, and Karout,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_68"></A><A HREF="#fn_65"><FONT SIZE="1">61</FONT></A> the earth-worm.

The butterfly has her house, pohota.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_68"><FONT SIZE="1">64</FONT></A> (This word refers to the sacred enclosure of brush made in circular form, in which the religious ceremonies were held.) Wiskun, chipmunk, and also the larger squirrel, yet have the mavakul,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_73"></A><A HREF="#fn_69"><FONT SIZE="1">65</FONT></A> (log hollowed out and used for holding acorns. The allusion is to the log which the chipmunk carried when he was one of the First People, a log ten men could not lift, on which they laid the body of Ouiot when they burned it.) The song on the record ends here. The rest of the song is as follows: Atachama,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_74"></A><A HREF="#fn_70"><FONT SIZE="1">66</FONT></A> a bird, and another bird are mentioned.</p>

<p>Record 373. Song of Temenganesh. By Alba&ntilde;as. Luise&ntilde;o words: Memec no asunecua awawik,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_75"></A><A HREF="#fn_71"><FONT SIZE="1">67</FONT></A> etc., "I am something doing." This is Nemoimal season.

In the center, "here," the deer sheds his hair, and the acorn grows fat. The sky "sheds," that is, changes color. The clouds of winter are swept away. Tupush is sky. Nahonit also means sky. Tukmit is the personified sky.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_81"></A><A HREF="#fn_77"><FONT SIZE="1">73</FONT></A> This is the season of Pahoyomal, when snakes crawl out, frogs sing, trees are juicy and ready to put out leaves, in early spring.</p>

Antares and Altair rise.&#151;In the west the eagle mentions the things in the ocean.&#151;The singer does not know what these words mean. The Chungichnish worship with its songs was brought to the mountain Indians from the islands of the ocean. He mentions Harasa, Catalina Island, and Kimki, San Clemente Island.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">80</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Record 377. Song of Temenganesh. By Alba&ntilde;as. Mulmus&ntilde;a hete pela kamai temet, etc. The sun rose at Mulmus.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_89"></A><A HREF="#fn_85"><FONT SIZE="1">81</FONT></A> Antares rose too.</p>

The song mentions the cold wind of early morning when Antares rises, at the time when all the Indians take a bath. This was the rule. Everyone must bathe daily.</p>  
<p>Record 379. By Alba&ntilde;as. After the Temenganesh series comes the Kwinamish series, songs of the spirit. In the Image ceremony the songs of Pikmakvul, songs of death, each one mentioning Ouiot, are sung for six or seven hours; then Temenganesh, Kwinamish, and others. In the Girls&#146; ceremony the Kwinamish songs come second.</p>  
<p>First song of Kwinamish. This is like talking to themselves, and sending their spirit to the Milky Way. This song tells of the council the people held after the death of Ouiot, to see what they could do, after they found that there was death. This mentions Yula Wanawut,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_97"></A><A HREF="#fn_93"><FONT SIZE="1">89</FONT></A> the spirit of the dead. If the ceremonies are done right, the spirit will be sent off all right, and will not stay in its former abode. In the council they tried to see what they could do about their spirits, and so they arranged these ceremonies. The song says: The Sky, after all these ceremonies were rightly done, felt good in his heart. It mentions the sand-painting, Eskanish Tarohayish.</p>  
<p>Record 380. Song of Kwinamish. By Alba&ntilde;as. Tomamik yula poaukala,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_98"></A><A HREF="#fn_94"><FONT SIZE="1">90</FONT></A> north the spirit remains; kwimik yula poaukala,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_99"></A><A HREF="#fn_94"><FONT SIZE="1">90</FONT></A> east the spirit remains; south and west, the same. It is held, tied, to the four quarters of the sky, so that it will remain there and will not get away.</p>  
<p>Record 381. Kwinamish song. By Alba&ntilde;as. Tomamik yula Wanawut poponakala po&ntilde;arakala auma,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_100"></A><A HREF="#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">91</FONT></A> etc. "To the north the</p>

<p>Record 382. Kwinamish song. By Alba&ntilde;as. No suna qua haiyawa moyna, no suna qua takwaya moyna,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_102"></A><A HREF="#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">93</FONT></A> etc. "At the time of death, when I found there was to be death, I was very much surprised. All was failing. My home, I was sad to leave it." The second part means: "I have been looking far, sending my spirit north, south, east, and west, trying to escape from death, but could find nothing, no way of escape."</p>  
<p>Record 383. Song of Munival. By Alba&ntilde;as. The Munival songs are individual and inherited. They describe the exact route of the Temecula people, ancestors to the singer, and the landmarks made by each to claim title to places in their migrations, usually at very short distances. Munival no qua awut,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_103"></A><A HREF="#fn_98"><FONT SIZE="1">94</FONT></A> "the tracks I do not understand." Munival no qua nalachat,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_104"></A><A HREF="#fn_99"><FONT SIZE="1">95</FONT></A> "the tracks I make mistakes about." They are therefore explained. The song mentions different places: Nachivo pomisavo,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_105"></A><A HREF="#fn_100"><FONT SIZE="1">96</FONT></A> the ca&ntilde;on the First People could not go through; Tokta totpa,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_101"><FONT SIZE="1">97</FONT></A> a place; Kawima polalak,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_102"><FONT SIZE="1">98</FONT></A> a certain hill; Ashwut kalikwona (eagle sits on something), a place; Waasawaha pometavoy;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_103"><FONT SIZE="1">99</FONT></A> and Exvo Temeko,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_104"><FONT SIZE="1">100</FONT></A> Temecula.</p>

<p>series are secret individual songs, descended in the family or composed by the singer. This is a song the great-uncle of Alba&ntilde;as used to sing. No enge no mane hortata kulkula, etc., from my feet, from my hands, I drew forth, etc.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_106"><FONT SIZE="1">102</FONT></A>. Some of the shamans would extract something from their legs or hands or different parts of the body during the dances to show their power: acorns or rabbits or little snakes or frogs. Alba&ntilde;as&#146;s great-aunt was a shaman, and could vomit up from her mouth a small live rattlesnake.</p>  
<p>Record 385. Song of Chatish. By Alba&ntilde;as. Nororia hechum sil pom mane,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">103</FONT></A> etc. "It thundered. Something from their feet, their hands, etc." The earth shakes and rumbles when the shamans march around.</p>  
<p>These songs were sometimes sung to make plenty, to bring abundance of rain, grass, and acorns. They are also called Songs of Numkwish&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_108"><FONT SIZE="1">104</FONT></A> or Tuknish.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">105</FONT></A> Each "hechicero" has two or three of these secret songs, which he sings at his house and not at public gatherings.</p>  
<p>Record 386. Chatish song. By Alba&ntilde;as. These songs were also sung to hurt people with sickness and death, and this particular song could kill a man at a distance of many miles. Lewea&nbsp;lewea towowea, shoots off an invisible (spirit-like) power. The "hechicero" had within him something which could not be seen.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">106</FONT></A> He would draw it out and throw it off towards the man he wished to injure. The "hechicero stick,"&#151;wood without stone in the end, shaped like a small straight sword,&#151;would be used to do this.</p>  
<p>Sometimes several shamans met at a house to kill a man at a distance. Tukmul Chayut (double name: tukmul, flat coiled basket, Chayut, flat twined basket)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">107</FONT></A> would be made ready, each</p>

<p>man bringing his own basket. Chungichnish said that they must always have tukmul chayut when they had the ceremonies or did anything. A certain Indian's mother was killed by witchcraft by his own uncle, after which some of his mother's people, shamans, met together at night and killed the old man in the same way. He died in a few days. Another well-known instance of these beliefs was the killing by witchcraft of the woman who dispossessed the Indians from an ancient village site, having acquired the land under the terms of a Spanish grant. The Indians thus driven off had their revenge in this way, and she did not live long to enjoy her property.</p>  
<p>Record 387. By Alba&ntilde;as. Song of Anut, the large ant of the ant-ordeal, used as a hunting song, since the ordeal has been long discontinued. Pom peai yaumo oskamo.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_112"><FONT SIZE="1">108</FONT></A> "They kept the game to themselves." This tells about the animals when they were killed after the death of Ouiot. Mountain lion killed the deer, though he tried to escape from death. Tukwut, mountain lion, Iswut, wolf (long since extinct), Tomihut, summer-cloud or thunder-cloud,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">109</FONT></A> were some of the chief men in arranging the ceremonies after the death of Ouiot. They are mentioned in the song.</p>  
<p>Record 388. Song of Chatish. By Alba&ntilde;as. Words: Necop manaa, Towit manaa, Yawit manaa, etc. "It is coming to me. Towit is coming. Yawit is coming."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_114"><FONT SIZE="1">110</FONT></A> Towit is the thick mist that comes before the rain.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">111</FONT></A> This is a Chungichnish song of plenty. One man will dance while another sings it. It may also be sung as an individual song at the Image ceremony.</p>  
<p>Record 389. Sung by Lucario Cuevish. This song was sung in the ceremony for healing a man punished by Chungichnish. It is a Chungichnish song. Anyone in the old times revealing the secrets ("as I am doing now," he says), would be stricken down with illness, and these songs would aid in effecting his cure.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> The song mentions hainit, the band around the head used to put the feathers in, and pecheya, feather headdress.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_121"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">112</FONT></A> It tells about the shadows cast by the sun. The connection between hainit and the sun is hard to be understood; but the allusion may possibly be the same here as in the myth,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_122"></A><A HREF="#fn_117"><FONT SIZE="1">113</FONT></A> where it is difficult to understand who Hainit was. He was probably the one among the First People who afterwards became the head-band for the feathers.</p>  
<p>Record 390. Chungichnish song. By Lucario Cuevish. The song mentions Muta, the horned owl, whose feathers make the sacred headdress. It mentions also the sea-weed on the seashore, one of the First People and sacred to Chungichnish. It mentions pecheya, feather headdress. The same words are repeated over and over.</p>  
<p>The Chungichnish worship was brought to the mountains from San Juan Capistrano. Near Capistrano is a hill where there are a live rattlesnake and a raven, Chungichnish animals, that have been there from time immemorial. They are still there.</p>  
<p>Record 391. By Lucario Cuevish. Not a song, but a recitative by the eagle; part of the Ouiot story. The eagle, seeking escape from death, went north from Temecula to San Bernardino, came around by the east to the south and west through Julian, Cuyamaca, and Palomar, going towards Temecula, and died at Temecula.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_123"></A><A HREF="#fn_118"><FONT SIZE="1">114</FONT></A> The eagle sang this song or recitative at Temecula. When he got sick he talked this way. He was talking about the spirit. When they were all going along they could hear something singing far away, and the eagle said that was the spirit; and he told the people that everywhere that he had been, north, south, east, and west, death was there waiting for them. It was very near. No one knew when it would come, but they would all have to die.</p>  
<p>Record 392. By Lucario Cuevish. Song of the Eagle ceremony. The mourning for the dead, cutting the hair, and so on,</p>

<p>continues for a year or so, until they have the eagle ceremony at the time the chief decides. This ends the period of mourning. The eagle is killed amid universal lamentations. He is one of the representatives of the spirit and is connected with the spirits of the dead. The song means: "Stand up and hold the eagle in</p>

<p>Record 1097. Diegue&ntilde;o. By Hatakek. Tutomunp. It refers to Wikami, Mohave Avikwame, the sacred mountain where all the people were created and where all religious song and dance originated. This place is alluded to at the beginning of every ceremony. The song means: There were two brothers. The father died and his spirit went north into the pine trees and forests.

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_124"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 124</FONT></A></p>  
<p>is almost endless, as they are sung all night and for several nights during the Image ceremony. Each song is different. It is impossible to collect the entire series or to trace very clearly the connection between the songs. The singer, a very old man from Manzanita, was sent for far and wide to conduct the Image ceremony on the occasions when it was celebrated. The memory displayed in retention of these series of songs is remarkable.</p>

<p><A NAME="page_125"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 125</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> This song is the same as the beginning of the war dance. It also repeats part of the last record, which is sung when the dancers come in on hands and knees. The singer drank the toloache in his youth. The last ceremony at Manzanita was about fifty years ago. Five old men remain in this region who are toloache initiates.</p>  
<p>Record 1072. Diegue&ntilde;o. Toloache song. Also a war dance song. This song is also used at Mesa Grande. Hulapok, the singer, first heard this song at a village called Hawiya, south of Julian.</p>  
<p>Besides the ceremonial songs, the myths have their own songs, which are incorporated in the story as part of the text which they amplify and explain, giving character to the narrative as light and shade do to a picture. The story can be told without them, but it loses much of its emphasis and impressiveness.</p>  
<p>The Cuyahomarr story of which three versions have been given: one from Mesa Grande, called The Story of Chaup;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_147"></A><A HREF="#fn_142"><FONT SIZE="1">137a</FONT></A> and two, one a fragment, from Manzanita,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_148"></A><A HREF="#fn_143"><FONT SIZE="1">137b</FONT></A> is a good example of a primitive myth in which the narrative is blended with song.</p>  
<p>The Luise&ntilde;os have a version of the same story communicated to them sixty years ago by the Mesa Grande people.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_149"></A><A HREF="#fn_144"><FONT SIZE="1">137c</FONT></A> Some of the old men among the Luise&ntilde;os can sing its songs, but they hesitate to relate the story from the Diegue&ntilde;o, being uncertain of the meaning in parts, especially in the songs.</p>  
<p>One such song was sung to me by Salvador Cuevas, Luise&ntilde;o, but he was reluctant to begin it, fearing that Takwish, Chaup, might overhear him. As Chaup's dwelling place is in the San Bernardino or San Jacinto mountains, not so very far from La Jolla in the mountains, the fear seemed well founded.</p>  
<p>The Diegue&ntilde;os identified the being whose name on earth was Cuyahomarr, the wonder-working boy, and whose name in the sky is Chaup or Shiwiw, with the large meteoric fire-ball which is his physical manifestation.</p>  
<p>Certain Indians, it is said, have an ogre myth-being who is</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_126"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 126</FONT></A></p>  
<p>identified in their myths with the electric fireball. The two stories have therefore become blended to a certain extent; but while the full text of the Diegue&ntilde;o Cuyahomarr myth has been obtained, and some fragments of the ogre story have been secured, it has not been possible to trace the latter with precision.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_150"></A><A HREF="#fn_145"><FONT SIZE="1">137d</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Chaup is feared among the Luise&ntilde;os and Diegue&ntilde;os, but why or in what degree it is difficult to say. It is said that the Indians believe that if he casts the shadow of a man on the ground in his passage overhead, the man will soon die.</p>  
<p>The Luise&ntilde;os sometimes call him Towish Takwish, which means spirit meteor. The younger Indians, who know only the corrupted meaning of Towish, which in modern Luise&ntilde;o is 'devil,' understand it in that sense.</p>  
<p>Takwish, Salvador Cuevas explained, takes the spirit of people just before they die. He does not take the body. One sees the light because he is carrying the spirit.</p>  
<p>The following are graphophone records of songs of the Diegue&ntilde;o Cuyahomarr myth.</p>  
<p>1. From Mesa Grande. Sung by Antonio. The flute is making music to call the girls.</p>  
<p>Ichtaha kwataha, Ichtaha kwataha, Toli otoli, toli otoli, Ichtaha kotoho, Ichtaha kwataha, Toli otoli kotoli, Toli otoli kotoli, etc.</p>  
<p>The brothers sat down facing in turn towards the north, south, east, and west, and girls from the four quarters came to them attracted by the music, but none pleased them except the girls from the east.</p>  
<p>2. By Antonio. The girls by the pond first hear the music of the flute. "It was the younger sister who first heard the music. The girls were on their way to a pond where they used to swim every morning."</p>  
<p>3. By Antonio. The girls&#146; song of farewell to their home. They have come very far and they can see their home far away. "They looked back and saw their old home and sang a song of farewell."</p>  
<p>4. By Antonio. The old woman, Sinyohauch, or Sinyohau&#146;,</p>

<p>Kamaina chakom whi-i.</p>  
<p>7. By Antonio. Cuyahomarr sat on his grandmother's lap and she put her arms around him and they both cried. Antonio feels like crying when he sings this:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Kawa kowa hi-i, Kawa kowa hi,<br> Kawa kowa hi-i, Kawa kowa hi, etc.</div></p>

<p>Third song on the record. The song of the brothers when the whirlwind lifted the eagles out of their graves.

<p>10. Diegue&ntilde;o song sung by a Luise&ntilde;o, Salvador Cuevas, who does not know exactly what the words mean; but it is the song sung by the boy in the gambling game when he began to win back all that his uncle had lost. "As soon as he fixed his eyes upon him he made his uncle win. He began winning back every point he had lost." See Manzanita version of Cuyahomarr story.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_152"></A><A HREF="#fn_147"><FONT SIZE="1">137f</FONT></A></p>
