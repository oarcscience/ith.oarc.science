*Notes on the Shoshonean Dialects of Southern California*, by A. L.
Kroeber, \[1909\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHEMEHUEVI.

These notes were taken from an old man named Ashpam, and his wife, in
Mohave Valley across the Colorado river from Needles, California. Though
living among the Mohave, Ashpam is half Chemehuevi by birth. His wife is
entirely of Chemehuevi blood, and was born in Chemehuevi Valley. Neither
informant

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

knowing English, it was necessary to communicate through a Mohave
interpreter. This circumstance, combined with the small aptitude for
linguistic distinctions evinced by both informants, made it impossible
to secure connected texts. It was however possible to obtain material
elucidating several phases of the structure of the language, which had
presented themselves as problems in a study recently made of the closely
similar Ute dialects, <span id="fr_15"></span>[14](#fn_14) especially
the relation between the possessive pronouns and the characteristic
Shoshonean noun-suffixes.

*Pronominal Elements and Noun Endings*.

Chemehuevi differs from all the other dialects here considered in
suffixing instead of prefixing the pronominal elements. This is a
characteristic of the Ute-Chemehuevi group and of the Kern River
dialects, whereas all other Shoshonean languages pre-pose and probably
prefix these elements. As in Ute, the possessive suffixes denoting the
first and second person are -n and -m. The vowel connected with these
varies. It is impossible to consider the vowels preceding the final n or
m as parts of the suffix until it shall be clear in each case that they
are not the final stem vowel, which is usually inaudible through being
whispered, but reappears when a following suffix makes of it a syllable.
Words like kan, house, pu’, eye, tau, tooth, are almost certainly
originally kani, pui, and tawa. This is shown not only by their forms in
other dialects, but by the fact that they are occasionally heard as
kan<sup>i</sup> or pu’<sup>i</sup> in Chemehuevi. The same holds true of
Ute. As long as the vowel of the apparent suffix is therefore at least
in some cases really radical, it is difficult to assign it positively to
the suffix in any word. The a of the pronominal ending in the last words
of the following list is however apparently non-radical and part of the
suffix.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

mù<span class="it">v</span>-im, your nose.

pu-im, your eye, n<span class="it">ü</span>ni pu-um, my eyes.

tawa-n, my teeth, <span class="it">ü</span>mi tau, your teeth.

ag‘-on, my tongue, <span class="it">ü</span>mi ag‘, your tongue.

t<span class="it">ü</span>mp, mouth, t<span class="it">ö</span>mp-an, my
mouth.

totsi-n, my head.

</div>

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

totsi<span class="it">v</span>e-an, my hair.

qura-n, my neck.

mutsaw-un, my beard.

macitco-on, my nail.

h<span class="it">ö</span>a-n, n<span class="it">ü</span>ni h<span
class="it">ö</span>a, my bone, buñg-uts<sup>i</sup> h<span
class="it">ö</span>au, dog's bone.

n<span class="it">ü</span>mu-n, my liver.

bag‘ap-<span class="it">ü</span>n, my sandals.

kan-<span class="it">ü</span>m, your house.

t<span class="it">ö</span><span class="it">v</span>iw-am, your land.

piy<span class="it">ü</span>w-an, my heart.

paw-am, your blood, n<span class="it">ü</span>ni pau, my blood, pa<span
class="it">ü</span>-p<sup>i</sup>, blood.

</div>

The pronominal suffixes are not the only forms used in Chemehuevi to
indicate possession. The independent or subjective form of the pronoun
placed before a substantive has the same significance. It is therefore
possible to say kan-<span class="it">ü</span>m, your house, or <span
class="it">ü</span>mi kan. The two methods appear with about equal
frequency in the material obtained. The same is true in Ute. It is the
less surprising that these unabridged preposed forms should occur, when
it is recollected that the pronominal suffixes of Ute-Chemehuevi are
exceptional and therefore in all probability a later substitute for more
original prefixes.

As in other Shoshonean dialects, endings of certain nouns are lost when
the possessive pronoun is preposed or suffixed. There are however many
nouns that are never provided with such a detachable ending. This fact
must be understood before the nature and use of these endings in
Ute-Chemehuevi can be discussed. The word kan or kan<sup>i</sup>, house,
is invariable as regards use with or without the possessive pronoun.
N<span class="it">ü</span>ni kan, my house, kan-<span
class="it">ü</span>m, your house, show the same form of the noun as the
word house, kan, itself. -n is therefore not the detachable ending of
this word. As there are many similar stems in Chemehuevi, it follows
that the noun endings cannot be determined except from instances which
show each word in composition, or in use with the possessive pronoun, as
well as in its full independent form. Judging from the cases obtained,
the most frequent Ute-Chemehuevi ending is -p or -<span
class="it">v</span>. The majority of nouns with any other termination
seem to be stems without a suffix. In the abundance of its nouns used
without endings Ute-Chemehuevi differs from Luiseño-Cahuilla, where, as
has been shown, nearly every substantive which is not onomatopoetic,
duplicated, or denotive of a

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

part of the body, must, when absolute, carry a suffix. Chemehuevi mar,
metate, is the equivalent of Luiseño mal-al, and this of Nahuatl,
metl-atl, which by corruption is the origin of the word metate itself.

The following are nouns found without a suffix that is lost before a
possessive pronoun: ate, bow; wi, knife (Ute witc); kan<sup>i</sup>,
house; mar, metate; ba, water; bag‘ap, sandals.

The following nouns have been found to lose their ending when used with
the possessive pronoun: pa<span class="it">ü</span>-p<sup>i</sup>,
blood; koa-p, tobacco; ac-u<sup>m</sup>p, ac-<span
class="it">ü</span>mp, salt; buñg-uts, dog (Ute, sari-dj; with
possessive, sari-<span class="it">v</span>uñk). Ute s<span
class="it">ö</span>-up, s<span class="it">ö</span>-an, lungs, pi-upi,
pi-nañ, heart (Chemehuevi piy<span class="it">ü</span>w-an = pi<span
class="it">ü</span>-an, my heart), also show detachable endings. <span
id="fr_16"></span>[15](#fn_15)

The word t<span class="it">ö</span><span class="it">v</span>i-p, land or
earth, is interesting because the loss of its ending is accompanied by
the appearance of a final surd <span class="it">w</span>. Your land is
t<span class="it">ö</span><span class="it">v</span>i<span
class="it">w</span>-am; my land, n<span class="it">ü</span>ni t<span
class="it">ö</span><span class="it">v</span>i<span class="it">w</span>.
Bone, h<span class="it">ö</span>a or h<span class="it">ö</span>au (my
bone h<span class="it">ö</span>a-n), may show a similar ending. Such a
final <span class="it">w</span> sound crops out also in certain words in
Luiseño-Cahuilla and in Nahuatl. Luiseño pala, water, no-pauw, my water;
Nahuatl tetl, stone, no-teuh, nay stone.

No words denoting parts of the body could be obtained provided with an
ending except pa<span class="it">ü</span>-p<sup>i</sup>, blood. Almost
always such words were given accompanied by the possessive pronoun, more
frequently the suffix form. When the pronoun is preposed, or the third
person is signified, the stem appears in its native form. It does not
then show any such overwhelming tendency to end in a vowel as do the
stems of Cahuilla terms denoting parts of the body. It is however
difficult to speak of this matter on account of the frequent whispered
final vowels of Chemehuevi.

*Plural, Cases, Diminutive*.

A few occurrences of the plural suffix -m and of case postpositions
resembling those of Ute were found: puum, eyes;

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

a<span class="it">v</span>atem dawam, many men; kani-<span
class="it">v</span>ant, in the house; k<span
class="it">ö</span>tc-u-<span class="it">v</span>an, in the basket. The
suffix -its is a diminutive: aipa-ts, boy; pic<span
class="it">ö</span>-ts, girl; <span class="it">ü</span>ñap-itc, baby;
<span class="it">ö</span>caw-its, old man; mutudj-atc, hummingbird.

*Demonstratives and Interrogatives*.

The demonstratives and interrogatives, as compared with Ute, are:

The adverbial ending in both dialects appears to be -<span
class="it">v</span>a, the substantival or personal to be -ña in
Chemehuevi and -c or -ac in Ute. The demonstrative stems are i- (or
hin-), ma-, and u- (or o-, perhaps ua). Ute in, who, perhaps rests on
misunderstanding, Chemehuevi ha- being the regular Shoshonean stem for
who and where. In both dialects imb- occurs for what; the usual
Shoshonean form is hi-.

*Kawaiisu*.

The Chemehuevi material obtained has led to a comparison with the
Kawaiisu vocabularies printed in the preceding Shoshonean treatise.
Kawaiisu is the most westerly of the Ute-Chemehuevi dialects, being
spoken in the Tehachapi mountains. It is separated from Paiute and
Chemehuevi by a stretch of territory, the dialects spoken in which,
while known to be Shoshonean, are still undetermined. It is quite
possible that they are not of the Ute-Chemehuevi group, in which case
Kawaiisu would be territorially detached from the remainder of its
dialectic division.

Like Ute and Chemehuevi, Kawaiisu shows suffixes for the possessive
pronouns. The forms in the published vocabulary are -n, -n<sup>a</sup>,
for the first person, and -m, -m<sup>i</sup>, -mi for the second person.
A second vocabulary, obtained from an informant whose native dialect was
that of Kern river, throughout showed -na for my and -bi for your. While
these forms appear to be exaggerations, they almost certainly point to
-na and -mi as the stem forms for these pronominal suffixes, which
suffer some reduction owing to the Ute-Chemehuevi habit of not fully
articulating final vowels. There is thus a clear association of final a
with the suffix of the first person, and of final i with the suffix of
the second person; and in this respect Kawaiisu differs from both Ute
and Chemehuevi, in which it seems that the pronominal suffix is either
purely consonantal or has a variable vowel preceding instead of
following the consonant.

The plural nuwuwu, of nuw<sup>u</sup>, person, contains probably the
Ute-Chemehuevi plural suffix -um, -u<span class="it">v</span>, -u. The
Kawaiisu numerals obtained end in -i, like those of Chemehuevi. The word
obtained for nose, mu<span class="it">v</span>its, appears either to
mean nostril or to have meant it originally, to judge from the term in
other dialects. B<span class="it">ü</span>pi, blood, and nuwùpi, liver,
show the noun termination -pi. The word yuak<sup>a</sup> was obtained as
meaning world. The same word, yoaka, was obtained from the Serrano with
the meaning "mountains,"

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

and as the base of the term yoaka-yam, with which the Serrano designate
the Ute-Chemehuevi in general. Adjectives of color in Kawaiisu possess
an ending -gita, and most verbs were obtained with the ending -nami. The
demonstratives, i-t<span class="it">ü</span>, this, ma-, that, i-wana,
here, u-wenu, there, show the Chemehuevi stems i, ma, and u. The
interrogatives are the usual ha- for who and where, and hi for what. The
word d<span class="it">ü</span><span class="it">v</span>igani,
sweat-house, appears to mean "earth-house," and is interesting as a
compound of two nouns. This process, however frequent in Nahuatl, is
rather rare in Shoshonean. While the word for earth was obtained as dipa
in Kawaiisu, d<span class="it">ü</span><span class="it">v</span>i has a
close analogue in Chemehuevi t<span class="it">ö</span><span
class="it">v</span>i-p, and gani is house.

### Footnotes

74, 1908.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[259:15](nsd08.htm#fr_16) These forms and the
Chemehuevi ones make doubtful the statement (Am. Anthr., n.s., X, 76,
1908), based on the forms tcaxatc-in, my younger brother, and witc-im,
your knife, that the Ute noun-endings are not lost before pronominal
elements. The final -tc of tcaxatc and witc is perhaps not a
noun-ending, though Chemehuevi wi would seem to favor such an
explanation for witc. If this -tc is not an ending, the only
Ute-Chemehuevi noun-suffix as yet determined is <span
class="it">v</span>, p.
