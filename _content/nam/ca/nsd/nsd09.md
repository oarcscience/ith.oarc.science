*Notes on the Shoshonean Dialects of Southern California*, by A. L.
Kroeber, \[1909\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

### KERN RIVER.

The Kern River branch, or Tübatulabal dialect, can only be mentioned
here. The possessive my is expressed by -n, your by -ñ. This fact is of
significance since of all other Shoshonean dialectic groups
Ute-Chemehuevi alone suffixes the possessive pronominal elements. As
Tübatulabal is territorially in contact with Kawaiisu, there is the
possibility that one group has influenced the other in this respect. The
Tübatulabal words for man, woman, and house show a curious form of
reduplication to indicate the plural: datwal, adatwal; goim, ogogoim;
hanil, ahanhanil. It does not follow that these cases are typical of the
formation of the plural throughout the language. Most Shoshonean, and in
fact most Uto-Aztekan, dialects show a certain amount of reduplication
to express the plural without employing it as the regular or customary
means. The word anawic-m, Pleiades, meaning girls and unquestionably
plural in meaning, may contain the usual Shoshonean plural suffix -m.
Compare anawic-bit, girl, in which -bit is the diminutive; and anabic,
sweet. The name which the Tübatulabal apply to the Kawaiisu, Kawishm,
and perhaps their designation of the Bankalachi, Toloim, <span

A comparison of the practically equivalent Tübatulabal and Bankalachi
vocabularies shows several forms denoting parts of

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

the body used in one case with possessive affix and in the other
without. Such are cunan, my heart, and cunal, heart; buntcil and
puntsin, eye, the latter really my eye; mupit and mupin, nose. It thus
appears that in this dialectic group terms denoting parts of the body
are provided with noun endings when they are not used with a possessive
pronoun, in which respect the Kern River branch differs from the
Southern California and Ute-Chemehuevi dialectic groups.
