*Notes on the Shoshonean Dialects of Southern California*, by A. L.
Kroeber, \[1909\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### GENERAL COMPARISONS.

A certain amount of vocalic harmony is apparent in most Shoshonean
dialects. The direction of this influence is from the stem toward the
suffix or prefix. The vowel of the plural suffix in Luiseño-Cahuilla,
and the vowel of the possessive prefixes and suffixes in Serrano and
probably in Ute-Chemehuevi, undergo a moderate amount of modification in
accord with the vowel of the stem. This modification is not mere
assimilation.

So far as known reduplication can always be used in the Shoshonean verb.
Almost every dialect known presents a few cases of reduplication to
indicate the plural of the noun. It is comparatively frequent in Hopi
and Gabrielino. Luiseño, Cahuilla, Ute, Tübatulabal, and other dialects
each present a few instances. There is nothing to show that in any
dialect outside of Hopi and Gabrielino reduplication is used with any
considerable number of nouns. Even in these two dialects it is not the
only means of forming the plural. In other words, it may be said that
reduplication in the noun is always found to some extent in Shoshonean,
but is not specially developed nor nearly as characteristic as in Selish
and other northwestern languages. The extent of its use in the noun in
Shoshonean is much the same as in Nahuatl. In the verb, the entire first
syllable may be repeated; to indicate plurality in the noun, the
reduplication does not extend beyond the first vowel.

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

A suffix -m expressing the plural of animate nouns occurs in
Luiseño-Cahuilla, Gabrielino, Serrano, Ute-Chemehuevi, Hopi, probably
Kern River, and may be found in the other dialectic groups. It was
therefore part of the hypothetical generalized early Shoshonean, and
while it cannot be positively correlated with the Nahuatl plural suffix
-me, their identity is very probable, the more so as certain Sonoran
languages also use -m for the plural.

The objective suffix -i or -e occurs in two quite divergent Shoshonean
groups, Ute-Chemehuevi and Luiseño-Cahuilla. There is therefore reason
for believing that this suffix will be found also in other dialectic
divisions and that, like the plural suffix, it may have been a
characteristic of primitive Shoshonean. This is the more probable from
the fact that certain "Piman" languages of Sonora show objective
case-suffixes, such as the -e of Cahita.

The pronominal possessive elements are preposed or prefixed in all
Shoshonean dialectic groups except Kern River and Ute-Chemehuevi. They
are also preposed or prefixed in Nahuatl and the Piman languages. It is
therefore clear that this order is the original one, and that the
suffixed pronominal elements of Ute-Chemehuevi and Kern River represent
a subsequent development.

The pronominal element of the *first person singular* is in all dialects
n followed by a vowel. Occasionally this is developed by the addition of
a second syllable: noma, n<span class="it">ö</span>gi, n<span
class="it">ü</span>ni. The *possessive prefix* is also n followed by a
vowel, except that in Mono it is i-. The element of the *second person*
shows a fundamental type consisting of a vowel followed by m. Such is
Luiseño om. More often, however, this form is expanded by the addition
of a vowel, as in Gabrielino oma, Serrano <span class="it">ü</span>mi,
Kern River <span class="it">ü</span>mbi, Ute-Chemehuevi <span
class="it">ü</span>mi, or reduced by loss of the m, as in Cahuilla e and
Mono-Paviotso <span class="it">ü</span>. The *possessive prefix* of the
second person has its fundamental ni before the vowel, except in
Shikaviyam; but the use of the vowel without the m appears as in the
independent pronoun, in Luiseño, Cahuilla, and Mono. As possessive
suffix the element of the second person is also more variable than the
first, its -m becoming -ñ in Kern River, whereas -n remains such. The
vowels of the pronominal elements are <span class="it">ü</span>, <span
class="it">ö</span>, i, e, o, u,

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

but not a. Representing vowels by o and various consonants by k, the
scheme of the two elements is the following:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1 p: no, noko; pref., no-, o- (one dial.); suff., -n.

2 p: om, omo, o; pref., mo-, o-, om- (one dial.); suff., -m, -n.

</div>

The demonstratives are variable. The stem of "this" and "here" is i<span
class="it">v</span>-, in Luiseño-Cahuilla; mine, ik-, in Gabrielino;
i<span class="it">v</span>-, ip-, in Serrano; i- in Kern River; itc, i-,
iwa-, in Ute-Chemehuevi; i-, io, in Mono-Paviotso; i- in Hopi. These
forms point to an original i to indicate nearness, Gabrielino mine being
the only exception.

Stems indicating "that" and "there" are more variable, and there are
often two in one dialect: wan-, pe or po-, in Luiseño-Cahuilla; pem-,
mur-, in Gabrielino; am- in Serrano; <span class="it">ü</span>w- in Kern
River; ma-, u- or ua-, in Ute-Chemehuevi; a-, ia, in Mono-Paviotso.
These indicate a, am, ma, wan, u, po, as demonstrative roots of distance
or vague reference.

The interrogatives are much more uniform than the demonstratives. Except
for Luiseño-Cahuilla me-, where, the elements, so far as known, are
always ha-, who, hi-, what, ha-, where. It is interesting that the stems
for "who" and "where" should be alike and contrasted with "what."

Diminutives, such as Luiseño-Cahuilla -mal and the more widely spread
-it, -itc, -tsi, -bit of Serrano, Ute-Chemehuevi, Mono-Paviotsi, and
Kern River, appear to be frequent in Shoshonean generally, and recall
the diminutives, and suffixes of analogous categories, that are so
important in Nahuatl. Compositions of two nouns are not frequent in
Shoshonean. Incorporation of the noun object into the verb has not been
found. It is certainly very little developed, and probably lacking, in
all Shoshonean dialects. In fact its existence remains to be proved for
any Uto-Aztekan language outside of Nahuatl.

Terms denoting parts of the body appear to lack the characteristic
Uto-Atzekan noun-terminations in Luiseño-Cahuilla, Ute-Chemehuevi, and
other Shoshonean dialectic groups. Such words are customarily used with
possessive affixes, but in the absence of these the noun is not provided
with a termination. In the Kern river dialect, however, words denoting
parts of the body are provided with such suffixes like other nouns. The
same is true in Nahuatl.

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

The characteristic noun-endings of Uto-Aztekan are employed to varying
degrees by different Shoshonean dialects. No dialect is known which
applies such an ending to every noun. In addition to words signifying
parts of the body, Luiseño-Cahuilla leaves onomatopoetic or reduplicated
substantives without a suffix, while Ute-Chemehuevi adds a considerable
number of simple stems. A final w, probably aspirated, appears in a
limited number of stems—not the same ones—in Luiseño-Cahuilla,
Ute-Chemehuevi, and Nahuatl, when the possessive affix causes the loss
of the usual ending. The endings themselves show great diversity and
cannot yet be correlated between Shoshonean and Nahuatl nor between the
major branches of Shoshonean. Shoshonean tl appears on stems which in
several Shoshonean dialects are variously provided with different
endings. The -p or <span class="it">v</span> of Plateau Shoshonean is
either -l or -c or -t in Luiseño-Cahuilla. Luiseño-Cahuilla -l is used
on some stems which in Ute-Chemehuevi have a suffix, and on others which
in that dialectic group possess no ending. It would seem almost as if
each dialect, developing with a feeling for the need of noun-endings of
this character, had proceeded along its own line of growth, forming new
endings, and substituting one for another in this word and that, until
at present the various endings of the same word in the several dialectic
branches are often unrelated. If, or in so far as, they are correlated,
the connections between them promise to prove complex.

The Southern California dialects among themselves show rather regular
correspondences. Luiseño-Cahuilla -l is Serrano -tc, Gabrielino -r or
-t. Luiseño-Cahuilla -c has various equivalences, -tc, -t, -r, -c or -x.
Luiseño-Cahuilla -t is regularly the same in the two other groups. The
commonest ending in Southern California is -t; -l and -c are
characteristic of Luiseño-Cahuilla, -r of Gabrielino, and -tc of
Serrano.

Kern River endings are in general nearer to those of Southern California
than to those of the Plateau dialects, being -l and -t. -l corresponds
to Luiseño-Cahuilla -l, -c, and -t; -t usually represents
Luiseño-Cahuilla -t, but also -l and -c. The most characteristic ending
is -l.

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

The three dialectic groups of the Plateau branch show neither -l, -t,
-tc, -c, nor -r, but use -<span class="it">v</span> or -p endings. A few
stems like ku,—ku-c in Mono-Paviotso, ku-n in Ute-Chemehuevi and
Shoshoni-Comanche, ku-t in Southern California and Kern River,—give the
appearance of being provided with other endings; but it is not yet
certain that such final -c and -n really are detachable
noun-terminations. Plateau -<span class="it">v</span> and -p both
correspond at times to suffixes of the Luiseño -l class and at times of
the -t class.

Hopi also possesses different endings. They seem to be reducible to two
types, both of syllabic content; one can be represented by -wa, the
other by -h<span class="it">ö</span>, though the vowels vary. Neither
corresponds definitely to any type of Plateau, Kern River, or Southern
California ending.

Some determined detachable noun-endings common to three or more
Shoshonean dialectic groups are here tabulated. A dash indicates known
lack of a suffix.
