<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">YUMA CREATION MYTH, AS TOLD BY A DIEGUE&Ntilde;O.</H3>
<P>An old Yuma told the Diegue&ntilde;o interpreter Sant how the gods Tuchaipa and Yokomat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> first came into being.</P>
<P>When they came forth from the Earth mother, they had to pass through the ocean, which then covered the land; and the first-born, Tuchaipa, came up through the water with his eyes shut, so that he got through all right; but when his brother called to him to ask him how he managed it, he told him that he came through with his eyes open.</P>
<P>So Yokomat came with wide-open eyes through the ocean, and the salt water hurt his eyes and made him blind.</P>
<P>Each brother had brought an animal with him. Tuchaipa had the badger, and Yokomat the swift. The badger was rough and furry, and the swift's feathers were smooth and fine.</P>
<P>After they came out, when his brother could not see, Tuchaipa changed the animals, taking the swift for himself.</P>
<P>"What have you done?" asked his brother. "This is not my animal. This one is rough and furry."</P>
<P>"Yes, that is yours," said Tuchaipa.</P>
<P>But Yokomat was so angry that he went down into the ground again.</P>
<P>So Tuchaipa made the world by himself.</P>
<P>He made all the people. First he made the men, and then the women. The women were very hard to make.</P>
<P>Then he made the moon to give them light; but, finding that the moon was not bright enough, he made the sun to light the world.</P><DIR>
