# CEREMONIES AND TRADITIONS OF THE DIEGUEÑO INDIANS. <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0)

## BY CONSTANCE GODDARD DU BOIS.

THE following pages, discussing mainly the relations existing between
the religious practices and religious beliefs--the ceremonies and the
traditions--of the Diegueño Indians of Southern California, may be
regarded as supplementary to a parallel but fuller treatment of the
neighboring Luiseños. <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1) The Diegueños
are of Yuman stock, the Luiseños Shoshonean; but the two tribes are very
similar in general culture, and, as has been pointed out, one has
evidently greatly influenced the religious life of the other.
