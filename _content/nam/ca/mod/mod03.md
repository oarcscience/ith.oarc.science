### THE FLY AT THE COUNCIL.

Tu-chai-pai thought to himself, "If all my sons do not have enough food
and drink, what will become of them?" After he thought of that a long
time he said, "Then they would die." Then he said, "What do my men want
to do? I will give them three choices, to die now forever, or to live
for a time and return, or to live forever."

When he had finished thinking, he called all the men together, but not
the women; and he said to them, "I was thinking; there is not much food
and water now. I want to know what you wish to do, and I will give you
three choices; to die forever, to live for a time and return, or to live
forever." Some of the people said, "We want to die now forever." Others
said, "We want to live for a time and return." Others said, "We want to
live forever." So they talked and they talked, and they did not know
what to do.

Then the fly came and said, "Oh, you men, what are you talking so much
about? Tell him you want to die forever." So they talked and they talked
very much, and they made this choice, to die and to be done with life,
and to die forever. This is the reason the fly rubs his hands together.
He is begging forgiveness of the people for these words.
