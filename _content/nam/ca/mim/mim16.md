# 14. YAYALI, THE GIANT

"Where are you, grandchild? Where are you, grandchild? Where are you?
Where are you? Yes. Yes. I am lost. Where are you? This way. Where are
you, grandchild? Someone comes. Look out. Get ready. Prepare yourself,
for Yayali comes."

The people broke cones from the tops of the pine trees and bundled these
together. As Yayali started to climb the declivity where the people had
taken refuge, they set fire to the bundles of pine cones and threw them
into Yayali's burden basket. They threw the burning cones into the
basket. Yayali became so hot that he tumbled. "Which way shall I fall?"
he asked. They told him to fall to the north.

\[The Giant met his death near Columbia, Tuolumne County. The informant
has seen white rocks near Columbia, reputed to be the bleached bones of
the Giant.\]
