He came to the middle of the world where two maidens were living. He
smoked himself all day. When the sun went down they came out to look at
him. The next day they were pregnant. Their brothers went into the
sweat-house after him. They were going to cut the girls open and then
kill him. "Wait," said Yīmantūwiñyai, "I will make medicine. Give me a
cup." "Make the medicine right here," they said. Right there in the
house he made it of ashes. Then he hung up the straps of the carrying
baskets. He put some of the medicine in the mouth of one of them and
rubbed some of it across her abdomen. When he turned around he heard a
baby cry. When he had done the same to the other he turned again and
heard another baby cry. "This way it will be with those who know my
medicine." <span id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75)
