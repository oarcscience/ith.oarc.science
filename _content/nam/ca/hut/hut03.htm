<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">KEY TO THE SOUNDS REPRESENTED BY THE CHARACTERS USED.</H1>
<P>a as in father.</P>
<P>&#257; nearly of the same quality, but of longer duration. It is used as a matter of convenience to distinguish a few words from others nearly like them.</P>
<P>ai as in aisle.</P>
<P>e as in net. </P>
<P>&#275; as in they but lacking the vanish.</P>
<P>ei the sound of &#275; followed by a vanish.</P>
<P>i as in pin.</P>
<P>&#299; as in pique.</P>
<P>&#333; as in note.</P>
<P>o a more open sound than the last, nearly as in on.</P>
<P>oi as in boil.</P>
<P>&#363; as in rule.</P>
<P>&ucirc; nearly as in but, a little nearer to a.</P>
<SUP><P>&ucirc;</SUP> at faint sound like the last. Sometimes it is entirely wanting.</P>
<P>y as in yes.</P>
<P>w as in will.</P>
<I><P>w</I> an unvoiced w which occurs frequently at the end of syllables. When it follows vowels other than &#333; or &#363; it is preceded by a glide and is accordingly written u<I>w</I>.</P>
<P>h<I>w</I> the preceding in the initial position. It has nearly the sound of wh in who.</P>
<P>l as in let.</P>
<P>L an unvoiced sound made with the tip of the tongue against the teeth, the breath being allowed to escape rather freely at one side of the tongue.</P>
<U><P>L</U> nearly like the preceding, but the sides of the tongue are held more firmly against the back teeth, resulting in a harsher sound often beginning with a slight explosion. Some speakers place the tip of the tongue in the alveolar position.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_95"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 95</FONT></A></P>
<P>m as in English.</P>
<P>n usually as in English, but sometimes very short.</P>
<P>&ntilde; as ng in sing.</P>
<P>h as in English but somewhat stronger.</P>
<P>x has the sound of jota in Spanish.</P>
<P>s as in sit.</P>
<P>z the corresponding voiced continuant; only after d and rare.</P>
<P>c as sh in shall. It seldom occurs except after t.</P>
<P>d is spoken with the tongue on the teeth.</P>
<P>t an easily recognized, somewhat aspirated surd in the position of d.</P>
<I><P>t</I> an unaspirated surd which is distinguished from d with difficulty.</P>
<P>k, ky a surd stop having the contact on the posterior third of the hard palate. Except before e, &#275;, i, and &#299; a glide is noticeable and has been written as y.</P>
<P>g, gy the sonant of the preceding, occurs rarely.</P>
<P>k when written before a back vowel (a, o, &#333;, &ucirc;, &#363;) without a following y, stands for a surd nearly in the position of c in come, but the contact is very firm. The resulting sound is very harsh and quite unlike the English sound.</P>
<P>q is a velar surd occurring only before back vowels.</P>
<P>tc as ch in church.</P>
<P>dj the corresponding voiced sound equivalent to j or soft g in English.</P>
