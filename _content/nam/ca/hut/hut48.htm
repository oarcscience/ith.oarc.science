<P>When they had traveled some way the elder brother said, "You stay here. I will hide from you." He went on, and when his younger brother came along he jumped out of the brush dressed in the skin of the water monster. His brother almost died of fright. "That will answer," he said.</P>
<P>Then they went on until they came to Nad&#275;iltcw&ucirc;ndi&ntilde; (Tule ranch). "You stay here," he said. "I will go on alone." He put on the water monster's skin. He took two elder sticks and removed the pith. Then he put his vitals inside of them, slipping one stick over the other.</P>
<P>He went on until he came to Xo&ntilde;xau<I>w</I>di&ntilde; (Masten ranch). He went into the house where two women were sitting. One of them said to him, "You better go back.

"Stop, give me my arrow-point," said the one who shot. He jumped up river and across to the other side. He took out his vitals. One only of the elder sticks was burned through. Again he went on jumping along until he came to Nad&#275;iltcw&ucirc;ndi&ntilde;. Then they started toward home.</P>
<P>The wound was so hot he was nearly burned. When they came to Weitchpec Butte he said, "I wonder how it will be when Indians come." He looked around and saw something standing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_95"></A><A HREF="#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> there. He pulled it up and chewed it. He became cold again. "This is the way it will be," he thought.</P>
