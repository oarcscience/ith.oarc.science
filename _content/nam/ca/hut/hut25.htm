<P>Whatever has grown any where in the world in time past let it come back here. The people must eat but little. If one eats but little he shall feel as if he had eaten much. Birds must not like the food. Let every kind come back here which used to grow in the world.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_59"></A><A HREF="hut25.htm#fr_59">233:1</A> This formula is repeated after the feast is eaten and the people have gone away. The priest repeats it while standing close over the fire which is renewed to consume the remains of the feast. See Life and Culture of the Hupa, pp. 80, 81.</P>
