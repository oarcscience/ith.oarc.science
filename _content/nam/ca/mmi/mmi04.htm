<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">COMMENT BY SANT UPON THE CUY-A-HO-MARR STORY.</H3>
<P>The Mojave Indians have the story of Cuy-a-ho-marr, as have also the Maricopas of Arizona; and the Maricopa country must be the real home of Cuy-a-ho-marr's grandmother, Sin-yo-hauch, for in that place they still point out the big heap of ashes where she made her fire for cooking. This is a sort of stone that looks like ashes. And you can see the rock which the twin brothers climbed to get the eagles; and the heap of deer hides which they left when they skinned the deer; and the painted flutes striped with red which they played upon to call the girls. All these things are now seen turned into stone and rocks.</P>
