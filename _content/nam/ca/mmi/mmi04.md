### COMMENT BY SANT UPON THE CUY-A-HO-MARR STORY.

The Mojave Indians have the story of Cuy-a-ho-marr, as have also the
Maricopas of Arizona; and the Maricopa country must be the real home of
Cuy-a-ho-marr's grandmother, Sin-yo-hauch, for in that place they still
point out the big heap of ashes where she made her fire for cooking.
This is a sort of stone that looks like ashes. And you can see the rock
which the twin brothers climbed to get the eagles; and the heap of deer
hides which they left when they skinned the deer; and the painted flutes
striped with red which they played upon to call the girls. All these
things are now seen turned into stone and rocks.
