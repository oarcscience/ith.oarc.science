### 2. THE NORTH STAR AND THE RATTLESNAKE.

While they were living at Temecula, the rattlesnake was there, and
because he had no arms or legs the others would make fun of him. The
North Star, especially, who was then a person, was the leader in this
abuse. He would fling dirt in his face, throw him down, and drag him
about by the hair. So the rattlesnake went to the Earth-Mother and
complained of this treatment, wishing to avenge himself on Túk-músh-wút,
the North Star. So the Earth-Mother gave the rattlesnake two
sharp-pointed sticks with which he might defend himself against any who
disturbed him. So the next time when the North Star came and began to
torment him, the rattlesnake used the sticks (his fangs) and bit off one
of his fingers as you may still see in the sky. <span

The Earth-Mother further contrived that, in order to make the bite of
the rattlesnake effective, it should be followed by three intensely

hot days; and at the present time, when three hot days come in
succession, you may know that some man has been bitten by a rattlesnake.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_8"></span>[54:1](mmi06.htm#fr_8) Starting from the North
Star as a centre, there is a vortex of small stars, which in the clear
air of the southwest are very plainly seen. They may easily appear as
the five fingers of a hand; a line of three or four stars for the thumb,
with several curving lines for the fingers, of which the last, a
straight line shorter than the rest, and pointing towards Cassiopeia, is
the one bitten off by the rattlesnake.
