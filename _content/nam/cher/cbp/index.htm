<P>
Among their other many cultural gifts to the world,
Native Americans contributed the game
which later became known as Lacrosse.
<CITE>The Cherokee Ball Play</CITE> vividly describes the ethnography
of this sport with particular attention
to its ritual significance.</P>
<P>
This sport served as means of community social cohesion,
an occasion for some big wagers,
a surrogate for battle with other villages,
and sounds like a great deal of fun.
Many of the ceremonial aspects will be familiar to anyone
involved with High School football.
Some of the practices required a very high tolerance for pain.
On a spiritual level the game is a magical battle between shamans,
and the rituals and ceremonies used to gain
advantage are of great interest.</P>

<P>This monograph includes musical notation for some of the songs
transcribed by none other than John Phillip Sousa.</P>

<P>A short monograph about Ojibwa ball play which was
in the same volume as the Mooney
article is included as an appendix.</P>

<P>I have edited this document slightly so that some language in the
original document will not distract the modern reader.  Five
words have been substitued with neutral equivalents (in wavy brackets)
and one word and one sentence have been omitted
(indicated by ellipsis).</FONT></P>
