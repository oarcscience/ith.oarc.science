# 113. The Man In The Stump

A man who had a field of growing corn went out one day to see how it was
ripening and climbed a tall stump to get a better view. The stump was
hollow and a bear had a nest of cubs in the bottom. The man slipped and
fell down upon the cubs, which set up such a squealing that the old
she-bear heard them and came climbing down into the stump tail first, in
bear fashion, to see what was the matter. The man caught hold of her by
the hind legs and the old bear was so frightened that she at once
climbed out again, dragging the man, who thus got out of the stump, when
the bear ran away.
