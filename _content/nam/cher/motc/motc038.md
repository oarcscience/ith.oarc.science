# 38. Why The Turkey Gobbles

The Grouse used to have a fine voice and a good halloo in the ballplay.
All the animals and birds used to play ball in those days and were just
as proud of a loud halloo as the ball players of to-day. The Turkey had
not a good voice, so he asked the Grouse to give him lessons. The Grouse
agreed to teach him, but wanted pay for his trouble, and the Turkey
promised to give him some feathers to make himself a collar. That is how
the Grouse got his collar of turkey feathers. They began the lessons and
the Turkey learned very fast until the Grouse thought it was time to try
his voice. "Now," said the Grouse, "I'll stand on this hollow log, and
when I give the signal by tapping on it, you must halloo as loudly as
you can." So he got upon the log ready to tap on it, as a Grouse does,
but when he gave the signal the Turkey was so eager and excited that he
could not raise his voice for a shout, but only gobbled, and ever since
then he gobbles whenever he hears a noise.
