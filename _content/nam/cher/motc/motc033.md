# 33. The Migration Of The Animals

In the old times when the animals used to talk and hold councils, and
the Grubworm and Woodchuck used to marry people, there was once a great
famine of mast in the mountains, and all the animals and birds which
lived upon it met together and sent the Pigeon out to the low country to
see if any food could be found there. After a time she came back and
reported that she had found a country where the mast was "up to our
ankles" on the ground. So they got together and moved down into the low
country in a great army.
