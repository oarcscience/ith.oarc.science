# 28. What Became Of The Rabbit

The Deer was very angry at the Rabbit for filing his teeth and
determined to be revenged, but he kept still and pretended to be
friendly until the Rabbit was off his guard. Then one day, as they were
going along together talking, he challenged the Rabbit to jump against
him. Now the Rabbit is a great jumper, as every one knows, so he agreed
at once. There was a small stream beside the path, as there generally is
in that country, and the Deer said:

"Let's see if you can jump across this branch. We'll go back a piece,
and then when I say *Kû!* then both run and jump."

"All right," said the Rabbit. So they went back to get a good start, and
when the Deer gave the word *Kû!* they ran for the stream, and the
Rabbit made one jump and landed on the other side. But the Deer had
stopped on the bank, and when the Rabbit looked back the Deer had
conjured the stream so that it was a large river. The Rabbit was never
able to get back again and is still on the other side. The rabbit that
we know is only a little thing that came afterwards.
