# 55. The Uw\`tsûñ'ta

At Nûñ'däye'\`lï, the wildest spot on Nantahala river, in what is now
Macon county, North Carolina, where the overhanging cliff is highest and
the river far below, there lived in the old time a great snake called
the Uw\`tsûñ'ta or "bouncer," because it moved by jerks like a measuring
worm, with only one part of its body on the ground at a time. It stayed
generally on the east side, where the sun came first in the morning, and
used to cross by reaching over from the highest point of the cliff until
it could get a grip on the other side, when it would pull

*p. 304*

over the rest of its body. It was so immense that when it was thus
stretched across its shadow darkened the whole valley below. For a long
time the people did not know it was there, but when at last they found
out about it they were, afraid to live in the valley, so that it was
deserted even while still Indian country.
