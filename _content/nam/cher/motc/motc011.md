# 11. The Milky Way

Some people in the south had a corn mill, in which they pounded the corn
into meal, and several mornings when they came to fill it they noticed
that some of the meal had been stolen during the night. They examined
the ground and found the tracks of a dog, so the next night they
watched, and when the dog came from the north and began to eat the meal
out of the bowl they sprang out and whipped him. He ran off howling to
his home in the north, with the meal dropping from his mouth as he ran,
and leaving behind a white trail where now we see the Milky Way, which
the Cherokee call to this day Gi\`lï'-utsûñ'stänûñ'yï, "Where the dog
ran."
