## DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS.

It is exceedingly difficult to obtain from the doctors any accurate
statement of the nature of a malady, owing to the fact that their
description of the symptoms is always of the vaguest character, while in
general the name given to the disease by the shaman expresses only his
opinion as to the occult cause of the trouble. Thus they have definite
names for rheumatism, toothache, boils, and a few other ailments of like
positive character, but beyond this their description of symptoms
generally resolves itself into a statement that the patient has bad
dreams, looks black around the eyes, or feels tired, while the disease
is. assigned such names as "when they dream of snakes," "when they dream
of fish," "when ghosts trouble them," "when something is making
something else eat them," or "when the food is changed," i.e., when a
witch causes it to sprout and grow in the body of the patient or
transforms it into a lizard, frog, or sharpened stick.
