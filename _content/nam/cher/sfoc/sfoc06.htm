<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">THE GAHUNI MANUSCRIPT.</H2>
<P>The next book procured was obtained from a woman named Ay&acirc;sta, "The Spoiler," and had been written by her husband, Gahuni, who died about 30 years ago. The matter was not difficult to arrange, as she had already been employed on several occasions, so that she understood the purpose of the work, besides which her son had been regularly engaged to copy and classify the manuscripts already procured. The book was claimed as common property by</P>

<P>Ay&acirc;sta and her three sons, and negotiations had to be carried on with each one, although in this instance the cash amount involved was only half a dollar, in addition to another book into which to copy some family records and personal memoranda. The book contains only eight formulas, but these are of a character altogether unique, the directions especially throwing a curious light on Indian beliefs. There had been several other formulas of the class called Y'&ucirc;'<SUP>n</SUP>nw&euml;h&iuml;, to cause hatred between man and wife, but these had been torn out and destroyed by Ay&acirc;sta on the advice of an old shaman, in order that her sons might never learn them. In referring to the matter she spoke in a whisper, and it was evident enough that she had full faith in the deadly power of these spells.</P>
<P>In addition to the formulas the book contains about twenty pages of Scripture extracts in the same handwriting, for Gahuni, like several others of their shamans, combined the professions of Indian conjurer and Methodist preacher. After his death the book fell into the hands of the younger members of the family, who filled it with miscellaneous writings and scribblings. Among other things there are about seventy pages of what was intended to be a Cherokee-English pronouncing dictionary, probably written by the youngest son, already mentioned, who has attended school, and who served for some time as copyist on the formulas. This curious Indian production, of which only a few columns are filled out, consists of a list of simple English words and phrases, written in ordinary English script, followed by Cherokee characters intended to give the approximate pronunciation, together with the corresponding word in the Cherokee language and characters. As the language lacks a number of sounds which are of frequent occurrence in English, the attempts to indicate the pronunciation sometimes give amusing results. Thus we find: Fox (English script); <I>kw&acirc;gis&iuml;'</I> (Cherokee characters); <I>ts&uacute;`l&ucirc;'</I> (Cherokee characters). As the Cherokee language lacks the labial <I>f</I> and has no compound sound equivalent to our <I>x</I>, <I>kw&acirc;gis&iuml;'</I> is as near as the Cherokee speaker can come to pronouncing our word fox. In the same way "bet" becomes <I>w&euml;t&iuml;</I>, and "sheep" is <I>s&iacute;kw&iuml;</I>, while "if he has no dog" appears in the disguise of <I>ikw&iuml; h&acirc;s&iuml; n&acirc; d&acirc;'ga</I>.</P>
