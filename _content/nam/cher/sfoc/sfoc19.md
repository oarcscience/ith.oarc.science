## MEDICINE DANCES.

The Cherokees have a dance known as the Medicine Dance, which is
generally performed in connection with other dances when a number of
people assemble for a night of enjoyment. It possesses no features of
special interest and differs in no essential respect from a dozen other
of the lesser dances. Besides this, however, there was another, known as
the Medicine Boiling Dance, which, for importance and solemn ceremonial,
was second only to the great Green Corn Dance. It has now been
discontinued on the reservation for about twenty years. It took place in
the fall, probably preceding the Green Corn Dance, and continued four
days. The principal ceremony in connection with it was the drinking of a
strong decoction of various herbs, which acted as a violent emetic and
purgative. The usual fasting and going to water accompanied the dancing
and medicine-drinking.
