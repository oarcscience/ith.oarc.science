### REGALIA OF THE CANDIDATE.

The Mentor should instruct until he is satisfied that the Candidate
understands what the authority, powers, functions, and emoluments of a
Shaman are and then he should make sure that the Candidate is provided
with the required regalia, which are:--

A red skirt made of soft tanned deerskin.  
A cape made of otterskin tanned with the fur on.  
Two armlets made of hair shed from a buffalo.  
Two anklets made of rabbitskin tanned with the fur on.  
A whistle made from the ulnar bone of in eagle wing.  
A hoop made of a willow withe.

The Candidate should not be permitted to enter the Sacred Lodge in the
ceremonial camp without these regalia, which may be ornamented in any
manner the Mentor may permit. The Candidate may also provide himself
with such insignia as he is entitled to wear, take them with him into
the Sacred Lodge, and wear them while dancing the Sun Dance. He should
also be provided with a pipe and sufficient tobacco to last through four
days, from the time he enters the Sacred Lodge until the completion of
the dance.
