### SCOUTING FOR THE TREE

During the erection of the Sacred Lodge, the Superior should order the
hunter, or scout, to go and search for game, and if he should see signs
of an enemy, to return and report to him. The hunter should go, prepared
as if for hunting, and when he comes to growing cottonwood, he should
select a growing cottonwood tree, the butt of which should not be less
than two spans in circumference. The tree should be straight, and forked
at a height of about four times the distance from hand to hand when the
arms are outstretched. He should mark this tree with circles of red
paint, on

the west, north, east, and south sides. This tree is thereby made the
Sacred Tree and its *nagila* endowed with extraordinary potency so that
it can bring disaster on anyone who profanes it by treating it as other
trees are treated. Having so marked this tree, the hunter should return
to the camp and privately report to the Superior that he has found an
enemy near the camp.
