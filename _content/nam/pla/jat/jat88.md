### 86. AVOIDANCE OF THE MOTHER-IN-LAW.

The woman was afraid of deer raiser, the man who floated down. It is
their custom to be afraid of each other. When a man becomes a woman's
son-in-law she is afraid of him. The man also is afraid of his
mother-in-law. He does not go close to her. If a man happens to talk to
his brother-in-law he feels good about it. That is why it is good that
way, he said. <span id="fr_84"></span>[1](jat89.htm#fn_84)
