<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>A large quantity of corn is shelled. This is placed in a can with water until it is soaked. The corn is spread on a blanket until it is sprouted. It is placed in the sun until it is dry and then it is ground on the metate. Water is heated in a can by the fire and the meal is stirred in. When the water is about half boiled away the can is refilled. The fluid is strained and allowed to cool. It is poured into a barrel where it stands until it sends up bubbles. When it stops bubbling they drink it.</P>
