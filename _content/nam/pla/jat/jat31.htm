<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>Coyote having come to Owl who alone possessed arrows, took them away from him and killed him. After that, Coyote was the only one who had arrows and everyone was afraid of him. Since the arrows belonged to bad people, the others came together and discussed how they might take them away. The chief said to them, "That crazy fellow has the arrows. How shall we take them from him?" Black tail and white tail deer were first consulted. When it was Antelope's turn to be heard he said, "You need someone who is smart, I will take the arrow away from him for you."</P>
<P>Antelope's two small children went to Coyote who challenged them to a footrace. "You are too small to run a race," he replied. Beginning to run about them Coyote put the quiver on one of them and the bow on the other. When they were some distance from Coyote, they became large antelope. When Coyote realized what had happened, they were already a considerable distance away. He ran after them, but they were running very fast.</P>

<P>"Wait, my nephews," he called after them, "I will tell you something." The antelope paying no attention to him, ran on. Coyote became very tired. "Wait," he said, "it is my turn, give the arrows to me." "When you overtake us, we will give them to you," they replied.</P>
<P>Coyote having stopped, the two antelope stopped also but would not let him come near them. Coyote said, "Now, my nephews, your horns will be like bows and your manure will be like arrows."</P>
<P>Then Antelope said to the others, "I have taken away for you the things you were wishing, the arrows Coyote had in his hand. That is why it is good now. It Would have happened that people who were not good would have possessed arrows, and would have shot and killed human beings." Those who could run fast took away the arrows and all the other people were afraid. "You did well," the others said to them. "Now we need not be afraid." In this manner the arrows were taken from Coyote.</P>
