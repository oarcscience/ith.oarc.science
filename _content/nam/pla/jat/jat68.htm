<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>Long ago our camp was in the mountains beyond Taos. They moved away east after buffalo. They camped at TsedaL&icirc;j&icirc;nye, "stone black", at ILedz&icirc;ts&ocirc;ye, at Tsaiskaye, "stone cup", at Ts'ist'aye, at Tc&icirc;cnadenlaye, trees in a line", at Tc&icirc;cg&ocirc;d&icirc;Laneye, "stumps many", at Tsets'&ocirc;sgaiye, "stones fall down", at Xanadl&icirc;neye, "many springs", at Tsetc&icirc;tc&icirc;yadn?aye, "rough stones stick up", at Nab&icirc;?anye "a river", and at Dlests&ocirc;ye, "yellow paint ".</P>
<P>They brought meat in there; deer, white-tail deer, and elk. They saw buffalo there also and rode to them killing them. After a while they moved east to D&icirc;g&ocirc;jye, and still farther east to K'ais&icirc;kaye, "willows stand". There they brought in deer, white-tail deer, and elk. They moved to CaLg&icirc;j&icirc;h&icirc;, camping on the side of the mountain. From there they moved to Tse&icirc;tc&icirc;c&icirc; and &Icirc;Lk&icirc;nacnkaye, "gun was found", and TseLts&ocirc;das?&atilde;ye, "stone yellow stands". Turning sunwise they came back, carrying much antelope and white-tail deer meat. They were not hungry as they came back to Tsentc&icirc;nc&icirc;h&icirc; ain?ah&icirc;. We went up the canyon to Tsedag&ocirc;Ltc&icirc;ye, "stones top red", to Tsedah&icirc;nltc&icirc;yeye, to Tse&icirc;gaL&icirc;ye, "stone rattle", to Tsej&icirc;kah&icirc;?aye "stones run into the water", to Nab&icirc;?anye, to Xagagaiye, to Xanadl&icirc;neye. "springs", to Tsenasdz&ocirc;deye, "stones parallel", to D&icirc;benadj&icirc;l&ocirc;ye, "sheep lowered down", to a place down stream from TcanL&atilde;hi, "much manure". They came with the meat to Id&icirc;cl'&icirc;c&icirc;ye, then to Tc&icirc;c&icirc;ye, "red paint", then to Baitdzes&icirc;kaye, then to Dlecnt'&ucirc;eye, "poor paint", then to Mai?k&ocirc;dj&icirc;cdj&icirc;deye, and then they all camped by Taos at TseL&atilde;ye, "stones many".</P>
