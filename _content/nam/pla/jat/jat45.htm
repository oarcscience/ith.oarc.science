<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>They moved their camp from that place. Another girl became Coyote's wife. "I am going off to hunt," he said, and went away. At evening, when he came back his face and hands were covered with blood. He had caused his nose to bleed and rubbed the blood on his face and hands. "I killed a good many of them," he told them.
