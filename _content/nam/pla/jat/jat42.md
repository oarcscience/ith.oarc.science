### 40. COYOTE INSULTS THE ROCK. <span id="fr_62"></span>[1](jat43.htm#fn_62)

Coyote ran off from there and came where a rock was rolling around under
a cliff. "I am going to roll over you," the rock said. "I run fast. You
can not run over me," said Coyote. "Don't say that, I will roll over
you," cried the rock. Coyote defecated and urinated on top of it. The
stone commenced to roll. Coyote was running around in front of it. "Here
I am, roll on me," he cried. It was rolling after him pretty fast.
Coyote, as he was running around, started up a hill. The stone came
after him. When he started down, the stone still came after him. For a
long time, they did that until Coyote was tired out. "I am going to
clean it," said Coyote. Then he licked it clean and started off again.
