"I made these things which are on the earth so that you may like them. I have made everything that you will eat; the berries, amole fruit, and plums. Are you satisfied? I made all these for you when you were poor and had nothing. Are you pleased with all these fruits I have made for you." "They are very good, my grandson," she said. "You will eat them every summer.
