### 21. RELEASING THE BUFFALO. (Second Version.)

Raven had the buffalo hidden they say. Then the people found out about
it and went to his house. The house and Raven's children were covered
with ashes and grey and dirty. The smallest child took the stone away
from the opening to the lower world. Then the buffalo were in a large
herd on the plain.

"The eyeballs and the fat between the shoulders will be mine," Raven
said. "You did me a wrong. I lived on the buffalo. You took away the
stone and now you have caused me to be without anything to eat. You have
made me poor. I go about starving. That is why I eat whatever anybody
kills," Raven said this they say.
