### 81. OBSERVANCES IN BUTCHERING BUFFALO.

When a buffalo is skinned the hide is cut along the shoulder on the
right side. The fore leg and shoulder is taken off by cutting under. A
piece so long (ten inches) of yellow meat lying along the back is cut
off, and thrown toward the east. That piece is not carried home. The
biceps muscle is also cut off from both sides of the animal. These
pieces also are not carried home. All the remainder of the animal is
used. This is the way they do.

"Do not throw the feet about," they are always told, "for it is
dangerous." One must not throw about the saddle used upon the horse in
bringing in the meat. Nor must the saddle blanket nor the rope nor the
bridle be thrown around. If these things are thrown about, the horse may
slip and fall. This is the rule. That is all.
