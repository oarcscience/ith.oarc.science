<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>They bring the medicineman buffalo manure. He makes a level place on the ground. The men being called, come together. Then he scatters down some pollen and strews L'ectc&icirc;c toward it and prays. He sings four times and then stops. From over there the buffalo bellow. The buffalo manure stands on edge and moves itself and shakes off the L'ectc&icirc;c. All the people believe it is true and pray, saying, "May the buffalo be near us. May we camp there among them. May there be much there to eat. With plenty of meat may we move our camp back to our own country."</P>
<P>This is the way they do when there are no buffalo. From there they go back, carrying the meat with them to their own country. This is the way they do.</P>
