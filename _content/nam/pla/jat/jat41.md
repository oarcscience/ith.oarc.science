### 39. COYOTE IS SHOT WITH A PINE TREE. <span id="fr_61"></span>[4](#fn_61)

of a whole pine tree that stood there. "That arrow will not kill
anything. Let me see it," said Coyote. "Shoot me with it." They shot him
with it. He ran away from them and everybody ran after him. Finally,
Coyote was tired out. The arrow had passed through him carrying away all
of his body except a rim of hair. "The hair on my back must have blown
off," Coyote said.
