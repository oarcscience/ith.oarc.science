<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>When a buffalo is skinned the hide is cut along the shoulder on the right side. The fore leg and shoulder is taken off by cutting under. A piece so long (ten inches) of yellow meat lying along the back is cut off, and thrown toward the east. That piece is not carried home. The biceps muscle is also cut off from both sides of the animal. These pieces also are not carried home. All the remainder of the animal is used. This is the way they do.</P>
<P>"Do not throw the feet about," they are always told, "for it is dangerous." One must not throw about the saddle used upon the horse in bringing in the meat. Nor must the saddle blanket nor the rope nor the bridle be thrown around. If these things are thrown about, the horse may slip and fall. This is the rule. That is all.</P>
