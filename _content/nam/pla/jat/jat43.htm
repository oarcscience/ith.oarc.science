<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>He came to a camp and asked that a girl be given him in marriage. The man had said, "I will give my daughter to one who has large leg muscles."

"I am going to get my horse," Coyote told them. His wife's family still remained there while the others moved away. When Coyote did not return, those who remained started and went to the other camp.
