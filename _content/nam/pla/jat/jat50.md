### 48. WOODPECKER DESCRIBES HIMSELF.

They say Woodpecker spoke as follows: "I like to climb trees. I live
among them because no one talks to me. I peck holes and eat with my hard
bill. I raise my children in the holes I make. That is why I like the
trees. I live upon their pitch. Whatever happens I do not complain

because I have supernatural power. I like to carry about the rotten
pine. I like to pull off its bark. I like the trees because I live upon
them. He painted my face red and made my bill with which I carry wood.
Although I peck with it all day, my head does not ache. My hand does not
get tired because I am used to it. I go among the trees all the time
because I like them very much. I eat the pitch and get fat from it. I go
among the trees by means of my wings. I like to fly about from the top
of one tree to another. That is why I do not complain. Because it is my
nature I live among the trees. I sleep well in my house."
