### 16. COYOTE SECURES FIRE. (Second Version.)

Coyote came where there were three children. "Show me where the trail
goes up," he said. "I will give you these beads if you will show me the
trail." Then he gave them the beads. They showed him a piñon tree by
means of which the people went up and down. He went down by the aid of
the piñon tree by means of which the people went up and down. He looked
for some white clay with which, when he found it, he whitened his face,
making zigzag lines.

He came where they were dancing and mingled with them. "Coyote, your
tail is burning," one of them said to him. "I have supernatural power
for that. It won't burn," he replied. He went among them again, poking
the fire with his tail until it took fire, when he jumped over them and
ran away with it. "Coyote does not know the trail up the wall," they
said. He ran away with the fire and they all ran after him.

When Coyote was tired out, he gave the fire to Duck who ran with it.
When Duck was tired he gave it to Dove. Dove ran with it until he was
tired and gave it to Kingfisher who ran with it. "Fire came from me," he
said. Kingfisher flew entirely around the border of the sky with the
fire.

"Fire came from me. All the people secured their fire from me." The
people ate with it and their food became sweet. The people all over the
world were pleased. Something good happened.
