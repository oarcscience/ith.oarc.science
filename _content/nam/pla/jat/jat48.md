### 46. FROG WINS FROM ANTELOPE IN A FOOTRACE. <span id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65)

Two antelope were gambling with a white tailed deer and a frog. The
antelope and deer ran a race in the woods. White tail deer jumped over
the tree and beat, for antelope had to run where there are no trees. He
won from antelope the dew claws and the fat on the hips.

Then the antelope suggested that they run a race with frog out on the
plains. Many frogs put themselves in a line, reaching from the starting
place to the goal. When they started to run each frog jumped this way
just as one shakes a string. The antelope was beaten because he thought
frog could not possibly win. That was the way it was done.
