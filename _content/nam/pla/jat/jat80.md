### 78. THE MEDICINE CEREMONY.

They spread out sand making it smooth. Around the border of this they
put up eagle tail feathers in a circle. The people sit around. They make
red, yellow, and white paint. They provide too L'ectcîc, and pollen and
blue (made by mixing white paint with charcoal). Here in the center is
placed a clay vessel containing water. One person sits on one side and
another on this side. They strew down the colors making all the animals
which are on the earth. Those sitting around do not omit any of them.
They watch the work and ask each other if all have been made. Then those
for whom the ceremony is held come there and sit in a row. They sit on
all of the animals. The medicineman shakes the rattle and sings. The
patients cry very hard. Their hands begin to twist, their feet to get
crooked. They cry and their noses run. The medicineman puts the rattle
under their feet, on their hands. He embraces them. Now they get well.
They drink the medicine and put it all over their bodies. They get well.
