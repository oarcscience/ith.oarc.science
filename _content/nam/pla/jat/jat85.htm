<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>"That the buffalo may be near. I make a smoke for you. There will be many buffalo close to us. You will come close around us. Right there we will go among them and will kill many. There will be much meat, not far from us. We will camp among them, and from there will bring home the meat to our own country," they say.</P>
<P>They sing for the buffalo. "Buffalo are running," they say. They sing. They dance, making horns on each side of their heads. Those who dance make motions. "Hw&ocirc;" they say. That is the way they sing.</P>
<P>They sing for the young yellow calf also. That is all.</P>
