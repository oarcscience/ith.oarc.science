### 50. LEWIS WOODPECKER DESCRIBES HIMSELF.

"My name is Niji. My eyes shine. My beads are becoming to me and my coat
is very black. I raise my children in a hole in a tree. My young like to
live there. They feed upon grasshoppers and flies. I live with my
children. My red breast is becoming to me. I shout every summer and the
people like to hear me. They all know my voice. I do not eat much pitch
but I like acorns." This way he spoke they say.
