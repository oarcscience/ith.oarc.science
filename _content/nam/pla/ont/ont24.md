#### CEREMONIAL OF THE SUN-DANCE

<span class="small">The Mad Dogs build the sweat lodge.—Ceremonial of
the sweat lodge.—Tribal parade of men and women on horseback.—Elaborate
and interesting costumes.—Impressive evening ceremonial in Mad Wolf's
tipi.—Prayer of the head chief.—Indian humour.—Practical jokes.—Dance of
the Brave Dogs.—Bringing in the poles and branches for constructing the
Sun lodge.—Ceremonial of felling a tree for the Centre Pole.</span>

TEN of the Mad Dogs rode to the river to cut one hundred long willow
branches for the large sweat lodge. On their return, they entered from
the side that faced the setting sun. Forming in line, they marched
slowly round the camp circle, holding the green branches high in the
air, and singing their society song in unison. When they returned to the
place where they had entered, they built the framework of the lodge
there, by firmly setting the willow branches in the ground, and bending
them into the form of an ellipse, about four feet high, facing the
entrance toward the rising sun. The north side was painted red and the
south black. When the sweat lodge was finished, other Mad Dogs were
called upon to gather one hundred stones of the size of a man's hand. If
a stone were to fall, it foreboded misfortune, and if, during the day
the men building the lodge either drank, or washed, it was believed to
bring rain, which would interfere with the ceremonies. A fire was built
for heating the stones.

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

Blankets and robes were thrown over the framework of the sweat lodge
and, when all was in readiness, the occupants of the sacred tipi came
forth. Mad Wolf led, followed by O-mis-tai-po-kah, Bull Child, Spotted
Eagle and Natosin. Then came Natokema and Gives-to-the-Sun.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They walked once
around the sweat lodge and Gives-to-the-Sun took her seat on the west
side. She sat smoking and praying, while the priests, with their helpers
the Mad Dogs, stood on the south side. A hole was dug inside the sweat
lodge to receive the heated stones. The earth was carefully placed on
one side, because it symbolised the earth thrown up by the

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

underground animals (beaver, otter, badger, and coyote). Mad Wolf then
arose and, taking off his blanket and moccasins, placed them beside
Gives-to-the-Sun. He entered the sweat lodge followed by
O-mis-tai-po-kah, Bull Child and Spotted Eagle, for inward purification
and to pray to the Sun, Moon and Morning Star in behalf of their people.
The paint was blessed

by Gives-to-the-Sun and along with a buffalo skull was handed to Mad
Wolf. He placed the skull beside the hole, the nose pointing toward the
west. It was laid upon the Soyotoiyis, a luxuriant meadow grass gathered
from beside springs. Spotted Eagle worked the paint in his hands arid,
using the tips of his fingers, marked black spots on the north side of
the skull to represent stars, and red for the sun on the south side.
While all were chanting in unison,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I now put you into the sacred place,"</span>

</div>

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Spotted Eagle
stuffed the grass into the nose and ears of the buffalo skull and tied
it around the horns, symbolising the feeding of the buffalo. The
Soyotoiyis (Carex Nebraskensis praevia) was the favourite food of the
buffalo. Those inside the sweat lodge waited until they saw smoke rising
from the sweet grass burning

outside, a sign that the stones were fully heated. They then sang four
songs, the fourth being,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"This spot is a holy place,"</span>

</div>

and handed out the buffalo skull to the Brave Dogs, who reversed the
head, pointing the nose towards the east, and laid it upon the pile of
earth, which represented the underground animals. One by one the heated
stones were passed into the sweat-lodge and dried sweet grass laid upon
the stones. Mad Wolf placed his hands in

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

the rising smoke and, rubbing them over his body, chanted and prayed to
the Sun:

<span class="small">"May our lives become as strong as the stones we
have placed here."</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Water was thrown
upon the hot stones, and, as the vapour arose, he prayed again:

<span class="small">"May our lives be as pure as the water, that we may
live to be old and always have water to drink."</span>

</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Mad Dogs
uncovered the sweat lodge four times, that those inside, dripping with
perspiration, might cool off. Each time it was closed, water was thrown
upon the hot stones. While the priests inhaled the vapour, they chanted
and prayed to the Sun, Moon and Morning Star, that their children might
live to be old, and always have plenty of food. When the Mad Dogs

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

uncovered the sweat lodge the fourth time, the priests came out. They
were given meat, but before eating, a blessing was asked upon the food,
each breaking off a small piece and, with a prayer, planting it in the
ground. The ceremonial was finished, when the Mad

</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Dogs tied the
buffalo skull, with strips of bark, to the framework of the sweat lodge,
the nose pointing towards the rising sun. Mad Wolf then arose, and,
followed by the priests and medicine women, led the way back to his
tipi. They walked slowly and in single file, with heads reverently
bowed, carefully avoiding the crossing of the trail, by which they had
left the tipi.

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> A sweat lodge had
been built in each of the four camps, made previous to the large
encampment, in which the Sun-lodge was constructed. In the first camp,
it was built on the east side; in the second, south; in the third, west
and in the fourth, on the north side, following the course of the sun
through the sky in summer.

Preceding the "Raising of the Pole," it was

customary for the tribe, both men and women, to dress in their finest
clothes and to paint and decorate their horses with feathers for a
parade through the camp. On this occasion the women, who were to take
part in the Scalp-dance that followed the parade, were permitted to wear
their husbands’ eagle feathers in their hair. There were many elaborate
and handsome costumes. Little Plume, a leading chief, wore a

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

hat made of a beautiful red fox-skin wound round his head, the tail of
the fox hanging down behind. The crown of the hat was decorated with
pieces of white weasel-skin, and two large eagle feathers stood erect at
the back. His shirt and leggings were of soft-tanned buck-skin, heavily
beaded and ornamented with many black-tipped ermine tails. The wife of
Mikosta

wore an otter-skin hat, with many shells as ornaments; a buck-skin dress
with two hundred and fifty elk tusks attached and an otter-skin across
her shoulders. Her saddle had deer-antler pommels with beaded pendants
and a beaded buck-skin crupper. Brightly coloured feathers were fastened
to her horse's tail and a large cluster of eagle feathers hung from his
neck. One young man was dressed as a clown, or jester. He

rode a black horse, his face and hands painted black, and he wore a long
black robe, which extended from his shoulders over his horse's tail and
flowed out behind when he galloped. All marched slowly around the great
circle of the encampment, singing in unison, some holding aloft scalps
tied to long willow sticks,

others long streamers of eagle feathers and feathered shields fastened
to poles. On the evening of the third day, the Sun-dance priests came,
one by one, to Mad Wolf's tipi. In this service O-mis-tai-po-kah and his
wife gave final instructions to Mad Wolf and Gives-to-the-Sun,
concerning the important ceremonial of "Raising the Centre Pole," which
would take place on the following day. Green branches had been

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

placed around the lodge on the outside, as the sign that only those
bidden should enter. I stood near the door listening to a weird chant
led by Mad Wolf. At intervals the low monotone of the priests was joined
by the shriller voices of the women. Gradually the chant died away and
there was silence, finally broken by Mad Wolf's voice directing that the
fire be replenished. When a brighter flame lighted up the lodge, I
decided that this was the opportune moment for entering, and so opened
the door. In the uncertain firelight I was not recognised and two
priests motioned me away. When I gave my Indian name, they bade me
enter. On Mad Wolf's left were O-mis-tai-po-kah, Natosin, the chief from
the north, and the Sun-dance priests; on his right, Gives-to-the-Sun,
the sacred woman, Natokema and their assistants. All the women wore gray
blankets coloured with dull red paint. Apisaki, daughter of Natosin,
alone wore a blanket of brilliant colours. She was unmarried and had
accompanied her father, that she might witness the medicine-lodge and
become familiar with its ceremonials. Over the head of Mad Wolf hung the
Medicine Pipe, and near by were the sacred bundles of the Beaver
Medicine and Medicine Bonnet, the latter to be worn by Gives-to-the-Sun,
during the ceremonial of "Raising the Pole," on the following day. In
front of Mad Wolf was an altar, or holy place, made by cutting out the
grass and smoothing the soft earth. It was lined with juniper (red
cedar). At the foot, and bending towards the west, was a single stalk of
wild rhubarb (cow parsnip), with an eagle plume fastened to the top. The
wild rhubarb and plume were used by the Indians in the Sun-dance
ceremonial as symbols of lightness, and were believed to favour the safe
raising

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

of the Centre Pole. A young warrior was chosen to secure a rhubarb plant
in bloom. Carrying it to the sacred tipi, he stood outside and
announced,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Here is the wild rhubarb."</span>

</div>

When Mad Wolf bade him enter, he passed on the south side of the fire,
laying the plant across the altar.

</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mad Wolf rubbed it
with black paint, and, tying an eagle plume to one of the stalks, placed
it upon the altar. Soft tanned buffalo and elk-skins were spread out,
and rattles for beating time were distributed, Mad Wolf directing that
two be given to his white son. Two redstone pipes were passed around,
one for the men and the other for the women. It was Morning Plume's duty
to see that the pipes were filled, and by

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

his side lay a large beaded tobacco bag, extra stems, and a tobacco
board for cutting. O-mis-tai-po-kah, as the father or instructor, gave
directions for conducting the ceremonies, the way the medicine bonnet
should be worn, and the songs that should be sung, while placing it upon
the head of Gives-to-the-Sun. He warned Mad

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Wolf that if the
ceremonials were not accurately performed, misfortune would follow. He
advised him to refrain from the use of sweet pine (balsam fir), as
incense during the Sun-dance. He made this injunction because in the
tradition the Sun instructed Scarface to use sweet grass as incense. He
also cautioned all to use great care in "Raising the Centre

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pole," and in
building the Sun-lodge, reminding them of the well-known chief, who had
died soon after the Pole had been carelessly allowed to lean towards
him, and warning them that, if any part of the sacred lodge should fall,
sickness and death would result. O-mis-tai-po-kah then prayed:

<span class="small">"Great Sun Power! I am praying for my people that
they may be happy in the summer and that they may live through the cold
of winter. Many are sick and in want. Pity them and let them survive.
Grant that they may live long and have abundance. May we go through
these ceremonies correctly, as you taught our forefathers to do in the
days that are past. If we make mistakes pity us. Help us, M other Earth!
for we depend upon your goodness. Let there be rain to water the
prairies, that the grass may grow long and the berries be abundant. O
Morning Star! when you look down upon us, give us peace and refreshing
sleep. Great Spirit! bless our children, friends, and visitors through a
happy life. May our trails lie straight and level before us. Let us live
to be old. We are all your children and ask these things with good
hearts."</span>

During the prayer of the head chief, all heads were reverently bowed,
and at the close they joined earnestly in an Amen. While inside the
sacred tipi, I took part in the ceremony, beating time with my rattles
and joining with the priests in the solemn chants.

Sounds from the outside attracted my attention and led me to leave Mad
Wolf and his company. They were so deeply engrossed in their solemn
service that they did not seem to notice my withdrawal.

Going out from the dimly lighted sacred tipi, I met a group of young men
dressed in their gay trappings on their way to a dance. They were
singing a Society song in unison, the bells fastened about their legs
jingling at every step. A horse passed, ridden by two young fellows,
singing together the "Black Tail Deer" song, while making the rounds of
the camp. Suddenly a band of Indians rushed out from behind a lodge.

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> With piercing war
whoops they closed around the two singers and beat their horse, causing
it to buck and plunge, but the riders pluckily held their seats.
Finally, amid laughter and shouting, they distanced their pursuers,
galloping off over the prairie.

Gaiety and humour are unexpected qualities to find concealed behind the
habitually stoical and solemn exterior of the Indians. But, when one has
been intimately associated with them in their camp life, he will find
many indications of their playfulness and keen sense of humour, and
that, when free from care and enjoying plenty, they are as light-hearted
and as happy as children.

While passing a lodge, I heard a man's voice calling loudly, "What has
become of the fellow that went after my horse?" When he repeated it,
those in the near lodges took up the cry, as a joke. One clan after
another quickly joined in the clamour, until the entire encampment was
in an uproar, to the great amusement of everyone.

Awunna told me of one of his pranks when a youth. With some companions
they captured a wild yearling colt, and pushed it into the lodge of one
of the older chiefs, who was unpopular, tying down the door flap. The
thoroughly frightened colt bucked and squealed, scattering the inside
fire, upsetting everything and kicking at the occupants, who almost
overturned the lodge in their mad scramble to escape.

It was considered a practical joke for young men to lasso and overturn
the tipis of old women at night, especially those of elderly single
women, who lived alone near their relatives. One of them passing on
horseback, would skilfully throw his lariat over the tops of the poles
and, with the other end securely

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

fastened to the horn of his saddle, would start off at a gallop. The
tipi would be jerked from its fastenings, the old woman would be
startled from her slumber by the disappearance of her home, as if struck
by a hurricane, and she would be left sitting up among her

<span id="img_29900"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![OLD WOMAN'S SMALL
TIPI.](tn/29900.jpg)

</span>

belongings, frightened and embarrassed by her sudden exposure to the
public view.

The sounds of drums came from the large lodge of the Mutsaix (Brave Dog
Society), where a crowd was gathered to watch their dance around an
inside fire. Crawling beneath the side of the tipi, I found myself among
the squaw spectators, who were so completely absorbed in the dance, that
they took no notice of my sudden appearance in their midst. The dancers
laid

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

aside their blankets and their naked painted bodies looked as savage and
frightful in the firelight, as they could make them. All had eagle-bone
whistles in their mouths, which they blew while dancing. They wore
belts, made of grizzly bear skins, with the tails hanging behind.
Mikasto, as the chief of the band, had other distinctive marks. He alone
carried a rattle. On his head was the scalp of a large gray wolf, the
skin of which was split and hung down his back with the tail almost
touching the ground. Four of the dancers were painted black. Four
others, as gray wolves, were covered with white clay, and had black
streaks painted under their eyes, also a black circle on the back. They
carried long spears painted white, with four eagle feathers attached to
them at regular intervals. They circled around the other dancers
imitating wolves driving together a herd of buffalo. Two other dancers
sat in a hole, near the door, representing grizzly bears in their den.
Their bodies were painted red and they had black streaks downward across
the eyes. Whenever the wolves herded their band together, the grizzly
bears jumped from their den, and pushing to the centre of the throng,
drove the dancers out and scattered them. The bears returned to their
den, while the wolves again began herding. After the dance was finished,
the Mutsaix marched through the camp, singing their society song and
calling out, "Let everyone be quiet to-night, because the sacred woman
is going through her ceremonial and should not be disturbed. Let all
rest well, for to-morrow we will build the Sun lodge." After completing
the circle of the camp they separated.

The labour of securing poles and branches for the Sun-lodge had been
evenly distributed among the tribe. Each clan was required to furnish
and put

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

its share in place. Women mounted on horseback carried the poles to
camp, riding on either side of them and holding them up from the ground
with lariats fastened to their saddles. The men also walked beside the
poles, as an extra precaution to prevent their touching the ground,
which was considered unlucky. Followed by a large crowd, singing war
songs and with the Mad Dogs shooting their rifles, they entered camp
from the north, south, east and west, carrying the poles to the place
chosen for the Sun-lodge. Mad Wolf selected the tree to be cut for the
Centre Pole. He struck the tree four times, and then handed the axe,
which was painted red, to Gives-to-the-Sun. While she chopped, she
prayed,

<span class="small">"Oh tree! I ask that you will fall easily. I promise
to plant you in a new place and to give you many presents. May you stand
firmly in your new home."</span>

A large crowd watched the cutting of the tree, praying to the Sun that
it might fall with its prongs flatwise, and not be broken. The crowd
cheered, when it swayed, and, while it was falling, many of the warriors
fired guns into the branches. When it struck the ground, they jumped
from their horses, and with shrill war-whoops broke the branches,
"counting coups," as if it were an enemy. After they had trimmed the
tree, its forked top was lifted upon a double travois. It was then borne
to camp and laid beside the open hole made to receive it.
