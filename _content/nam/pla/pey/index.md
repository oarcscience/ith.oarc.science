Peyote has never been a drug for thrill seekers. The small, hard cactus
is difficult to obtain. It tastes vile, ingestion normally leads to
painful vomiting, and the effects are more subtle than other
psychedelics.

The Native American Peyote ceremony emerged at the turn of the 20th
century, like the Ghost Dance, at a time when Native American culture
was under much stress. It blended Christian and traditional beliefs, and
used Peyote as a sacrament. The Peyote ceremony spread from the
Southwest into the Plains and other culture regions. Participants
reported a spiritual cleansing, and experienced healing effects, which
may be the result of powerful natural antibiotics in Peyote.

This is one of the first ethnographic accounts of the Peyote ceremony.
Paul Radin wrote this monograph, mostly consisting of first-hand
accounts, as part of his 1925 ethnography of the Winnebago tribe, who
live in Wisconsin. The Peyote 'Cult' did not die out as Radin thought it
might, but grew into the Native American Church, which is still going
strong today. This group fought the US legal system to get an exemption
to use the cactus, which is a controlled substance, in their ceremonies.
