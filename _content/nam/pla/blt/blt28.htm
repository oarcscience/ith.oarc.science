<p>Old Man was very hungry. He had been a long time without food, and was thinking how he could get something to eat, when he saw a band of elk on a ridge. So he went up to them and said, "Oh, my brothers, I am lonesome because I have no one to follow me."</p>  
<p>"Go on, Old Man," said the elk, "we will follow you." Old Man led them about a long time, and when it was dark, he came near a high-cut bank. He ran around to one side where there was a slope, and he went down and then stood right under the steep bluff, and called out, "Come on, that is a nice jump, you will laugh."</p>  
<p>So the elk jumped off, all but one cow, and were killed.</p>  
<p>"Come on," said Old Man, "they have all jumped but you, it is nice."</p>  
<p>"Take pity on me," replied the cow. "My child is about to be born, and I am very heavy. I am afraid to jump."</p>  
<p>"Go on, then," answered Old Man; "go and live; then there will be plenty of elk again some day."</p>  
<p>Now Old Man built a fire and cooked some ribs, and then he skinned all the elk, cut up the meat to dry, and hung the tongues up on a pole.</p>  
<p>Next day he went off, and did not come back until night, when he was very hungry again. "I'll roast some ribs," he said, "and a tongue, and I'll stuff a marrow gut and cook that. I guess that will be enough for to-night." But when he got to the place, the meat was all gone. The wolves had eaten it. "I was smart to hang up those tongues," he said, "or I would not have had anything to eat." But the tongues were all hollow. The mice had eaten the meat out, leaving only the skin. So Old Man starved again.</p>
