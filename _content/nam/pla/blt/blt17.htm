<p>Thunder&#151;you have heard him, he is everywhere. He roars in the mountains, he shouts far out on the prairie. He strikes the high rocks, and they fall to pieces. He hits a tree, and it is broken in slivers. He strikes the people, and they die. He is bad. He does not like the towering cliff, the standing tree, or living man. He likes to strike and crush them to the ground. Yes! yes! Of all he is most powerful; he is the one most strong. But I have not told you the worst: he sometimes steals women.</p>  
<p>Long ago, almost in the beginning, a man and his wife were sitting in their lodge, when Thunder came and struck them. The man was not killed. At first he was as if dead, but after a while he lived again, and rising looked about him. His wife was not there. "Oh, well," he thought, "she has gone to get some water or wood," and he sat a while; but when the sun had under-disappeared, he went out and inquired about her of the people. No one had seen her. He searched throughout the camp, but did not find her. Then he knew that Thunder had stolen her, and he went out on the hills alone and mourned.</p>  
<p>When morning came, he rose and wandered far away, and he asked all the animals he met if they knew where Thunder lived. They laughed, and would not answer. The Wolf said: "Do you think we would seek the home of the only one we fear? He is our only danger. From all others we can run away; but from him there is no running. He strikes, and there we lie. Turn back! go home! Do not look for</p>

<p>the dwelling-place of that dreadful one." But the man kept on, and travelled far away. Now he came to a lodge,&#151;a queer lodge, for it was made of stone; just like any other lodge, only it was made of stone. Here lived the Raven chief. The man entered.</p>  
<p>"Welcome, my friend," said the chief of Ravens. "Sit down, sit down." And food was placed before him.</p>  
<p>Then, when he had finished eating, the Raven said, "Why have you come?"</p>  
<p>"Thunder has stolen my wife," replied the man. "I seek his dwelling-place that I may find her."</p>  
<p>"Would you dare enter the lodge of that dreadful person?" asked the Raven. "He lives close by here. His lodge is of stone, like this; and hanging there, within, are eyes,&#151;the eyes of those he has killed or stolen. He has taken out their eyes and hung them in his lodge. Now, then, dare you enter there?"</p>  
<p>"No," replied the man. "I am afraid. What man could look at such dreadful things and live?"</p>  
<p>"No person can," said the Raven. "There is but one old Thunder fears. There is but one he cannot kill. It is I, it is the Ravens. Now I will give you medicine, and he shall not harm you. You shall enter there, and seek among those eyes your wife's; and if you find them, tell that Thunder why you came, and make him give them to you. Here, now, is a raven's wing. Just point it at him, and he will start back quick; but if that fail, take this. It is an arrow, and the shaft is made of elk-horn. Take this, I say, and shoot it through the lodge."</p>  
<p>"Why make a fool of me?" the poor man asked. "My heart is sad. I am crying." And he covered his head with his robe, and wept.</p>  
<p>"Oh," said the Raven, "you do not believe me. Come out, come out, and I will make you believe." When they</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_115"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 115</FONT></A></p>  
<p>stood outside, the Raven asked, "Is the home of your people far?"</p>  
<p>"A great distance," said the man.</p>  
<p>"Can you tell how many days you have travelled?"</p>  
<p>"No," he replied, "my heart is sad. I did not count the days. The berries have grown and ripened since I left."</p>  
<p>"Can you see your camp from here?" asked the Raven.</p>  
<p>The man did not speak. Then the Raven rubbed some medicine on his eyes and said, "Look!" The man looked, and saw the camp. It was close. He saw the people. He saw the smoke rising from the lodges.</p>  
<p>"Now you will believe," said the Raven. "Take now the arrow and the wing, and go and get your wife."</p>  
<p>So the man took these things, and went to the Thunder's lodge. He entered and sat down by the door-way. The Thunder sat within and looked at him with awful eyes. But the man looked above, and saw those many pairs of eyes. Among them were those of his wife.</p>  
<p>"Why have you come?" said the Thunder in a fearful voice.</p>  
<p>"I seek my wife," the man replied, "whom you have stolen. There hang her eyes."</p>  
<p>"No man can enter my lodge and live," said the Thunder; and he rose to strike him. Then the man pointed the raven wing at the Thunder, and he fell back on his couch and shivered. But he soon recovered, and rose again. Then the man fitted the elk-horn arrow to his bow, and shot it through the lodge of rock; right through that lodge of rock it pierced a jagged hole, and let the sunlight in.</p>  
<p>"Hold," said the Thunder. "Stop; you are the stronger. Yours the great medicine. You shall have your wife. Take down her eyes." Then the man cut the string that held them, and immediately his wife stood beside him.</p>  
<p>"Now," said the Thunder, "you know me. I am of great power. I live here in summer, but when winter comes, I go</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_116"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 116</FONT></A></p>  
<p>far south. I go south with the birds. Here is my pipe. It is medicine. Take it, and keep it. Now, when I first come in the spring, you shall fill and light this pipe, and you shall pray to me, you and the people. For I bring the rain which makes the berries large and ripe. I bring the rain which makes all things grow, and for this you shall pray to me, you and all the people."</p>  
<p>Thus the people got the first medicine pipe. It was long ago.</p>
