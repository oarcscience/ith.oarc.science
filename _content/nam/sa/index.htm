<P>
This index has links to resources at Intangible Textual Heritage about the religions
and spiritual practices of Native South Americans exclusive of the Incas.
Please note that while South America is a vast land with a great
diversity of environments and cultures,
the same cannot be said for the material available in
the public domain which is written in English; thus all of the
culture areas (except the Andean region) will be lumped
together here. At this time, however, only British Guiana
(now known as Guyana) is represented.
