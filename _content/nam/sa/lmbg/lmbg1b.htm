<TR><TD>'Twas long ago! yet still I view<BR>
The scene to me then fresh and new,<BR>
&#8195;Where two fair rivers flow;<BR>
Where stately moras tower above,<BR>
And palms wave gently in the grove,<BR>
&#8195;As pleasant breezes blow.<BR>

<BR>
I see, as natives pass me there,<BR>
Bright copper skins and jet black hair;<BR>
While one whose face is kind and fair<BR>
&#8195;The forest trees lays low.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Alone that Indian came to me,<BR>
A young white stranger's friend to be;<BR>
And hoping that the white man's "word"<BR>
Might to the red men light afford.<BR>
So when, oppressed by noontide glow,<BR>
He sought my hut&#8212;too close and low;<BR>
We to the river would repair,<BR>
And talk of Christ's religion there.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>There painted Caribs in our view<BR>
Would pass us in their light canoe,<BR>
&#8195;And slowly glide away.<BR>
We saw grim alligators sleep,<BR>
And languid lizards near them creep,<BR>
&#8195;In the meridian ray.<BR>
And there&#8212;while no sweet breeze above<BR>
Would stir the leaves and cheer the grove,<BR>
And water-lilies scarce could move&#8212;<BR>
&#8195;Would wait the cool of day.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>There he of God and of the soul<BR>
Would question in the "Dutch Creole;"<BR>
A "<I>patois</I>" I could daily hear<BR>
From an old negress living near,<BR>

<A NAME="page_5"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 5</FONT></A>

<BR>
And could reply to, <I>right or wrong</I>.<BR>
But when he spoke his own sweet tongue,<BR>
Too hard it was to understand,<BR>
Though helped by signs with head or hand!<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Time passed: he heard in his own tongue<BR>
Truths which to Christian faith belong.<BR>
&#8195;<I>Then</I>, first, to God he prayed.<BR>
And I from him their legends heard,<BR>
With that old superstitious "word"<BR>
&#8195;Which he before obeyed.<BR>
Of spirits good and bad he told;<BR>
Of sorcerers and warriors bold;<BR>
But chief, <I>this</I> legend, grave and old,<BR>
&#8195;Of <I>HIM</I> who all things made.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&#8195;&#8195;Allusion was made<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;To the tricks in their trade.<BR>
Which those Indian sorcerers have commonly played.<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;Now their <I>method</I> we show<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;In a story we know<BR>
Of what really happened a few years ago.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>

<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Two white men through our backwoods went, the Indian life to see,<BR>
And much they wished of "piai-men" to learn the mystery.<BR>
But 'twas in vain, till one declared that he was "taken sick;"<BR>
And begged his friend to "lend a hand, to carry out the trick."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>They knew a famous piai-man lived at a place near by;<BR>
"Oh come and cure this sick white man!" He answered, "I will try."<BR>
And so he brought his implements&#8212;no matter who might mock,<BR>
He'd win the battle with the rattle Creoles call "shok-shok."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>He first the females sternly bade to "take themselves away."<BR>
They all forthwith fled like the wind, too much afraid to stay.<BR>
He then made up his sacred fire, to burn the sacred weed,<BR>
His patient thought, "I like a <I>smoke</I>, but this is waste indeed!"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>His incantations then commenced, most terrible to hear,<BR>
Both to the patient and the men who might be ling'ring near.<BR>
He roared, he shouted at the fiends; perhaps he dared to curse;<BR>
'Twas all in vain; the patient groaned, and said, "I'm getting worse!"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>

<!------------------------page 24------------------------>

<A NAME="page_24"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 24</FONT></A>

<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>He next inhaled tobacco smoke, much as his mouth could hold:<BR>
And blew it on the sick white man, who thought, "He's getting bold.<BR>
It may be only want of sense&#8212;to fumigate my clothes;<BR>
But must be downright impudence to blow it up my nose!"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>He next on the affected part his hands began to rub;<BR>
The patient grew convulsed at that, 'twas such a ticklish job.<BR>
With strong, but stifled, laughter, soon his body shook all o'er;<BR>
That <I>tickling</I> was too much for him&#8212;he could hold out no more!<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>He laughed outright, then feebly tried to make that laugh a groan;<BR>
It would not do! the doctor knew the difference of tone.<BR>
He saw that he was being tricked, yet went on with his work;<BR>
Not altering a muscle, but as grave as any Turk.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>According to their ancient rules, his mouth he next applied,<BR>
To suck out what was Causing pain in that white man's inside.<BR>
Then from his mouth he would have spit nail, thorn, a claw, or pin,<BR>
And said, "From this sick man I've drawn what Yauhahu put in!"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>

<!------------------------page 25------------------------>

<A NAME="page_25"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 25</FONT></A>

<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Now when our white friend's flesh was sucked, he strove to turn away,<BR>
But "red-skin" meant to earn his fee, and would not be said "nay."<BR>
He seized him boldly <I>with his teeth</I>&#8212;it was a grip full sore&#8212;<BR>
And, with a yell, the patient fell, out on the earthen floor!<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Most cool the doctor was. By signs he made his meaning plain:<BR>
"Get back into that hammock. I must operate again!"<BR>
But the other shook his head, and said that <I>that</I> would "never do!"<BR>
Then showed his friend his injured side, and said 'twas "bitten through."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>But he replied, "This savage doctor knows a thing or two,<BR>
So do not quarrel with him, it would be much worse for you;<BR>
I'll tell him he has made a cure, and give a handsome fee."<BR>
So he, with cash and fame secure, walked off triumphantly.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><HR WIDTH="12.5%" ALIGN="center"></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>From this, gentle reader, you get a small view<BR>
Of what those men make a sick person go through:<BR>
The clash of the rattle, and shouts, causing fear,<BR>
Must be most distressing and painful to hear.<BR>
Then the fumes of tobacco, and smoke of the fire,<BR>
Will scarcely allow the poor wretch to respire.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>They spare not themselves! When a man's on probation,<BR>
And learning the mysteries of his vocation,<BR>
He's shut up, and half-starved; then, to take his degree,<BR>
Drinks tobacco decoction, as strong as can be,<BR>
Till he sinks in a trance: and revives&#8212;an M.D.!<BR></TD></TR>

<H5 ALIGN="center">NOTE TO ARAWIDI.</H5>

<P>&#8195;One apparent object of the great chain of legends, to which this belongs, was to give a mythical origin to the peculiarities of the various animals of Guiana, in connection with the deeds of the heroic personages of their national folk-lore.</P>

<P>&#8195;In the foregoing tale of Arawidi, those of the <I>alligator's</I> personal

<!------------------------page 29------------------------>

<A NAME="page_29"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 29</FONT></A>

appearance are accounted for. In other legends, those of monkeys, jaguars, &amp;c., were treated of. The fragmentary tale of the "Royal Vultures," of which the following outline was told to the writer by the Araw&acirc;ks of Tapacuma, will show how they dealt with <I>birds</I>&#8212;real or fictitious.</P>

<P>&#8195;"A bold young Araw&acirc;k hunter captures a beautiful royal vulture. She is the daughter of Anuanima, sovereign of a race which has its country above the sky. When at home there, they cease to be birds, and assume the form and habits of <I>human beings</I>. The captive, smitten with love for her handsome captor, lays aside her feathers, and appears before him as a beautiful girl. She becomes his wife, bears him above the clouds, and, after much trouble, persuades her father and family to receive him. All then goes well, until he expresses a wish to visit his aged mother, when they discard him, and set him on the top of a very high tree, the trunk of which is covered with formidable prickles. He appeals pathetically to all the living creatures around. Then spiders spin cords to help him, and fluttering birds ease his descent, so that at last he reaches the ground in safety."</P>

<P>&#8195;Then follow his efforts, extending over several years, to regain his wife, whom he tenderly loves. "Her family seek to destroy him, but by his strength and sagacity he is victorious in every encounter. The birds at length espouse his cause, assemble their forces, and bear him as their commander above the sky. He is at last slain by a valiant young warrior, resembling himself in person and features. It is <I>his own son</I>, born after his expulsion from the upper regions, and brought up there in ignorance of his father."</P>

<P>&#8195;The legend ends with the conflagration of the house of the royal vultures, who, "hemmed in by crowds of hostile birds, are unable to use their wings, and forced to fight and die in their human forms."</P>

<P>&#8195;The peculiarities of various birds common to the country are, in the episodes of this wild legend, whimsically accounted for. The following are instances:&#8212;</P>

<P>&#8195;The "kiskedee," though a valiant little bird, disliked the war, and bandaged his head with white cotton, pretending to be sick.

<!------------------------page 30------------------------>

<A NAME="page_30"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 30</FONT></A>

Being detected by more resolute warriors, as the hawk, &amp;c., he was sentenced to wear the bandage continually. In time it marked his plumage; and the white band is still conspicuous on the heads of his descendants, They are also noted for their hostility to hawks and other large birds, whom they attack incessantly when on the wing.</P>

<P>&#8195;The "warracobba" (trumpeter bird) and another quarrelled over the spoil, and knocked each other over into the ashes of the burnt house. The trumpeter arose with <I>patches of grey</I>, which are still seen on the plumage of his children. The other bird, which had been <I>rolled</I> in the ashes, became <I>grey all over</I>.</P>

<P>&#8195;The <I>owl</I> round among the spoil a package, done up with great care, which he thought would enrich him for life. It was a magical package, prepared by the foe for some emergency, and containing <I>darkness</I>. The darkness enveloped him as he opened it, and he has never since been able to endure the light of day!</P>

<P>&#8195;Thus&#8212;often whimsical and puerile, but displaying much fertility and boldness of invention, with here and there touches of romantic beauty&#8212;were the mythical tales of the Araw&acirc;k race in the days of yore. When the piai system began slowly to fade before Christianity, those legends, in their pure and connected shape, were no longer preserved. Their few remaining fragments are now distorted, intermixed, and in no two districts told alike.</P>

And throughout Surinam we know they'd many fighting men;<BR>
Others, beyond the Marowin, were living in Cayenne.<BR>

<BR>
They who oppressed our fathers here from Orinoco came,<BR>
Through Barima and Waiini, as we those rivers name.<BR>
Each year their painted warriors came, each year those rivers swept;<BR>
Poor captive women paddled them; and as they worked they wept.<BR>
Long time the Waraus, who lived there, their stern oppression felt;<BR>
Until they fled to "ita" swamps, where more secure they dwelt.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>The Caribs wasted all that land; then said, "We'll plunder find,<BR>
In those parts where Mor&#363;ca and its tributaries wind."<BR>
They came; but war canoes, too large, could not from Waiini pass:<BR>
Too little water was there then to float them through the grass.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>"O friends! ere next wet season comes we must for them prepare!"<BR>
So spake our chief, and chose that hill, to make a refuge there.<BR>
Then from all parts his brethren came until they mustered strong,<BR>
To save their wives and children dear from violence and wrong.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>"Now make a camp upon the hill, where women may abide;<BR>
We, who are men, will meet our foes down at the river's side."<BR>

<BR>
So to the river down they went, and there the captain made<BR>
A massive log of heavy wood, which in the stream he laid.<BR>
He fixed it tightly in each bank; the spot we now can show&#8212;<BR>
Just <I>there</I>&#8212;it near the surface crossed&#8212;not two hands'-breadth below.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>"Now let each man prepare his club, his arrows, and his bow,<BR>
And each a pole, with hook at end&#8212;its purpose I will show.<BR>
Some go to warn our brethren dear, who near the Waraus dwell;<BR>
While some as scouts must watch for foes, and of their coming tell."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>As our good chief had told his men, e'en so it came to pass,<BR>
When next, in those great swamps, the water overtopped the grass,<BR>
Many canoes, with painted crews, all warriors stout and strong,<BR>
Slow winding through those narrow streams, came paddling along.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>They stopped at every village there, but could no people find;<BR>
No people, and of property but little left behind.<BR>
That all had down Mor&#363;ca fled, by certain marks was shown,<BR>

"O strive to catch that light canoe, which skims along so fast;<BR>

<TR><TD>They raise on high their dreadful cry: "Carinyach!" echoes round,<BR>
As if yon Waram&#363;ri hill hurled back the hateful sound.<BR>
Onward they race until their "chase" is seen to disappear<BR>
Up this small stream; and, without pause, the Caribs enter here.<BR>
And here they have to wind about beneath the trees so high;<BR>
Yet still they onward rush and shout, nor think an ambush nigh.<BR>
The small craft slackens speed at length&#8212;it is not understood&#8212;<BR>
But they tear on with all their strength, and <I>strike the sunken wood</I>.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>That first canoe is broken: overthrown are all her crew!<BR>
And as they rise, with savage cries, keen arrows strike them through.<BR>
Their comrades hasten at their cry, that they may help afford;<BR>
And forthwith, on the next canoe, a second shower is poured.<BR>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD>Ere long the Caribs came in force, that they avenged might be,<BR>
And our men, hearing, went to meet them on the Waiini.<BR>
The Waraus would not help us fight, for they were sore afraid;<BR>
But they would act as scouts and spies, so giving useful aid;<BR>
Until we drew our foes again into an ambuscade.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Again we won the victory, again o'erthrew our foes,<BR>
As each side fought with deadly hate, no cry for mercy rose.<BR>
One champion on our side there was, Bohirasiri named<BR>
(In old times oft his praise was heard, for in our songs he's famed);<BR>
The Carib chieftain in the face with three-pronged shaft he shot;<BR>
Struck down his warriors all around, and dragged him from the spot.<BR>
The barb&eacute;d weapon from his face the wounded chieftain tore;<BR>
But cruel was the gash it made, and he could fight no more.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Our men, when all was over, and our foemen crushed and slain,<BR>
Said, "What must be Manarwa's doom? shall he alive remain?"<BR>


<!------------------------page 45------------------------>

<A NAME="page_45"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 45</FONT></A>

<BR>
So warriors and elders grave in council met next day,<BR>
Where the old chieftain, wounded sore, was asked what he could say.<BR>
"Oh why have rou, these many years, vexed cruelly this land?"<BR>
To which he could no answer give, as most may understand.<BR>
But <I>this</I> he said, "Lo, here I stand!&#8212;Arise, some one, and slay!<BR>
I'm in your power. But if you spare, and let me go away,<BR>
My people all will grateful be, and, for their leader's sake,<BR>
Will not again invade your land, but peace for ever make."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Our race is not bloodthirsty. They resolved, our old men say,<BR>
To take the Carib at his word, and let him go away.<BR>
Four of his men alone still lived, they were with him set free;<BR>
And their old chief the promise kept, which gained his liberty.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Perhaps those Orinoco Caribs found our swampy land<BR>
Was not so easy, as it seemed, to ravage and command;<BR>
Perhaps they learned what men can do who slaves will never be:<BR>
Rememb'ring, too, that o'er picked men we'd gained the victory!<BR>
But still that act of clemency, we think, availed us more<BR>
Than if we'd slain ten thousand warriors on that bloody shore.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Whatever cause may be assigned, we found their inroads cease,<BR>
And since those fights, of which I tell, this region has had peace.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>And came <I>alone</I>, Christ's word to hear.<BR>
&#8195;Till others rallied round;<BR>
Who helped a mission church to rear,<BR>
&#8195;With cross and belfry crowned,<BR>
Reflected in the waters clear,<BR>
With palms and feathery bamboos near,<BR>
&#8195;Where he had cleared the ground.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><I>All</I> those who then met there, save one<BR>
(Whose hand now writes), are dead and gone.<BR>
The mission crowns a neighb'ring hill.<BR>
That river's banks are hushed and still.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>No children now, with sportive grace,<BR>
&#8195;There swim from shore to shore;<BR>
But still the bamboos mark the place<BR>
&#8195;(Long since with "bush" grown o'er)<BR>
Which still one mem'ry loves to trace,<BR>
Where the chief sought his Maker's face,<BR>
&#8195;And told their ancient lore.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>And <I>all</I> who told, in their sweet tongue<BR>
&#8195;(Most sweet, as all allow),<BR>
These tales, which to their race belong,<BR>
&#8195;Are still and silent now.<BR>
They wait us on that other shore,<BR>
Their voices here are heard no more!<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Now turn we to the wilder lore<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;Of the uncouth Warau.<BR></TD></TR>

<P><A NAME="page_26_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_26_fr_1">1</A> The Araw&acirc;ks have various dances. In one, the men challenge each other to give and receive alternate lashes round the bare calf or the leg, with a severe whip called "Maquarri," which is the name of the dance. This is a sort of funeral game, or commemoration of some departed male relative or friend, held some time after his death. It differs from the purely festive dance mentioned above.</P>
