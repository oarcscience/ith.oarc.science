##### NOTE TO ARAWIDI.

 One apparent object of the great chain of legends, to which this
belongs, was to give a mythical origin to the peculiarities of the
various animals of Guiana, in connection with the deeds of the heroic
personages of their national folk-lore.

 In the foregoing tale of Arawidi, those of the *alligator's* personal
<span id="page_29">p. 29</span> appearance are accounted for. In other
legends, those of monkeys, jaguars, &c., were treated of. The
fragmentary tale of the "Royal Vultures," of which the following outline
was told to the writer by the Arawâks of Tapacuma, will show how they
dealt with *birds*—real or fictitious.

 "A bold young Arawâk hunter captures a beautiful royal vulture. She is
the daughter of Anuanima, sovereign of a race which has its country
above the sky. When at home there, they cease to be birds, and assume
the form and habits of *human beings*. The captive, smitten with love
for her handsome captor, lays aside her feathers, and appears before him
as a beautiful girl. She becomes his wife, bears him above the clouds,
and, after much trouble, persuades her father and family to receive him.
All then goes well, until he expresses a wish to visit his aged mother,
when they discard him, and set him on the top of a very high tree, the
trunk of which is covered with formidable prickles. He appeals
pathetically to all the living creatures around. Then spiders spin cords
to help him, and fluttering birds ease his descent, so that at last he
reaches the ground in safety."

 Then follow his efforts, extending over several years, to regain his
wife, whom he tenderly loves. "Her family seek to destroy him, but by
his strength and sagacity he is victorious in every encounter. The birds
at length espouse his cause, assemble their forces, and bear him as
their commander above the sky. He is at last slain by a valiant young
warrior, resembling himself in person and features. It is *his own son*,
born after his expulsion from the upper regions, and brought up there in
ignorance of his father."

 The legend ends with the conflagration of the house of the royal
vultures, who, "hemmed in by crowds of hostile birds, are unable to use
their wings, and forced to fight and die in their human forms."

 The peculiarities of various birds common to the country are, in the
episodes of this wild legend, whimsically accounted for. The following
are instances:—

 The "kiskedee," though a valiant little bird, disliked the war, and
bandaged his head with white cotton, pretending to be sick. <span
id="page_30">p. 30</span> Being detected by more resolute warriors, as
the hawk, &c., he was sentenced to wear the bandage continually. In time
it marked his plumage; and the white band is still conspicuous on the
heads of his descendants, They are also noted for their hostility to
hawks and other large birds, whom they attack incessantly when on the
wing.

 The "warracobba" (trumpeter bird) and another quarrelled over the
spoil, and knocked each other over into the ashes of the burnt house.
The trumpeter arose with *patches of grey*, which are still seen on the
plumage of his children. The other bird, which had been *rolled* in the
ashes, became *grey all over*.

 The *owl* round among the spoil a package, done up with great care,
which he thought would enrich him for life. It was a magical package,
prepared by the foe for some emergency, and containing *darkness*. The
darkness enveloped him as he opened it, and he has never since been able
to endure the light of day!

 Thus—often whimsical and puerile, but displaying much fertility and
boldness of invention, with here and there touches of romantic
beauty—were the mythical tales of the Arawâk race in the days of yore.
When the piai system began slowly to fade before Christianity, those
legends, in their pure and connected shape, were no longer preserved.
Their few remaining fragments are now distorted, intermixed, and in no
two districts told alike.
