Made them of <I>one speech</I> to be,<BR>
Bade them live in unity.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>That there might be no oppression,<BR>
&#8195;Man was made, and placed o'er all.<BR>
That first man, of wise discretion,<BR>

Just, as well as kind, was he:<BR>
All obeyed him lovingly.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>What the Caribs may tell of that wonderful tree,<BR>
With our own native legend would mainly agree;<BR>
But we say that "Ahkoo"<A NAME="page_127_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_127_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A> the noble tree found&#8212;<BR>
That our <I>first man alone</I> brought it down to the ground,<BR>
And the animals helped him in planting around.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>For the beasts and the birds were industrious all,<BR>
Till "Iwarreka" (so the brown monkey we call)<BR>

<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;To the spirit of play<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;And sheer mischief gave way;<BR>
Then he plagued and tormented the rest all the day.<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;His work was not done,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;For he thought but of fun,<BR>
And into the wildest excesses would run.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>He grinned when they begged him to let them alone,<BR>
So they to the master complained&#8212;every one.<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;He pulls at our tails,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Or nips with his nails,<BR>
And will bite us severely when any trick fails."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>So the master passed sentence on that wicked elf&#8212;<BR>
"Iwarreka, leave us, and work by thyself;<BR>
It will keep thee from mischief to go to yon spring,<BR>
And thence, in a basket, fresh water to bring."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=center>*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>When the tree was cut down, the good master soon found<BR>
Swelling waters within: and he saw there abound<BR>
Those fishes which now swim in rivers around.<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;"Though more labour for me,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;This a blessing will be,<BR>
To have fishes in fresh water, as in the sea.<BR>
"I will spread them," said he; "every river shall share:<BR>
For all rivers have equal right to my care."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Then, addressing the well,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;He said, "Wilt thou tell<BR>
For what purpose thy wonderful waters now swell?"<BR>
And he found that those waters, ere next rise of sun,<BR>
O'er the world, all around, were preparing to run.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>

<!------------------------page 129------------------------>

<A NAME="page_129"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 129</FONT></A>

<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Then with dexterous hands a wide basket he made,<BR>
Which, inverted, he over the hollow stump laid;<BR>
And such was its virtue that, while it remained<BR>
As he placed it, the fountain within was restrained.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=center>*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Iwarreka, meanwhile, obedience shirking,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Had given up working,<BR>
And near to the spot at that time he was lurking.<BR>
He, seeing the basket thus placed with such care,<BR>
Said, "The choicest of fruits our sly master hides there.<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;I will take while I may,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Now they all are away,<BR>
Such a fine chance as this will not come ev'ry day."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>So, with a light spring, on the margin he stands;<BR>
The basket he raises with pilfering hands&#8212;<BR>
One moment, no more&#8212;for a terrible flood<BR>
Bursting forth, sends him rolling in water and mud.<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;With splutter and scream,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;He is borne down the stream:<BR>
A warning to all the dishonest, we deem.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>His screams are sufficient the others to scare,<BR>
They all come in affright, and the master is there;<BR>
But more for themselves than the monkey they care.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;"See the water!" they cried,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;"Pouring over the side.<BR>
See! the fishes are all swimming down with the tide.<BR>
See, the stump and the roots are all forced from the ground,<BR>
And the land disappears as the waters flow round.<BR>
O man, our good leader! we cleave to thy side,<BR>
And thou for the safety of all must provide."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>

<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>So the man leads the way, till before him he sees<BR>
A tall hill, with high rocks; and some cocorite trees.<BR>
Then says, "We may find a last refuge in these.<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;You, who rest in a tree,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Here may climb up with me;<BR>
And in yonder high cave all the others must be."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>So the birds fly up first; and then up the tree go<BR>
The opossum, coati, and others you know.<BR>
Black monkeys and brown soon the master surround,<BR>
All striving to get farthest off from the ground.<BR>
There the queer spider monkey, with long limbs, is seen.<BR>
"Sakuwinki's" lithe form, and his fur olive green;<BR>
The red-bearded one, which "Arowta"<A NAME="page_130_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_130_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A> we call;<BR>
The marmosets small&#8212;and, in fact, monkeys all,<BR>
There sit, in the palm, to be kept safe from harm,<BR>
With their tails round their neck, curled, to keep themselves warm.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Such a rain then succeeded as none before knew,<BR>
Nor has such been experienced by me or by you.<BR>
Fierce lightning, loud thunder; no sight of the sun<BR>
Till three or four nights into one night had run.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=center>*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>The man sat with patience, for, do what he would,<BR>
He knew that he never could stay that great flood;<BR>
But he let fall the seeds of the cocorite tree,<BR>
To tell, by the splash, where the water might be.<BR>
He at length found it lower; at last it seemed gone;<BR>
Then they ate of the palm-fruits, and welcomed the dawn.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Thus the man, beasts, and birds were preserved, as we see,<BR>
Though cold, wet, and hungry, of course they would be.<BR>
But <I>some</I> met with <I>troubles</I>, of which, sages say,<BR>
Their children bear tokens to this very day.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>And first, the "baboon," as your creoles now call<BR>
The great howling monkey, the reddest of all.<BR>
His voice, we are told, ere he climbed up that tree,<BR>
Was more pleasant to hear than his person to see.<BR>
He began <I>first</I> to roar, as he felt his heart fail,<BR>
When those waters were wetting his feet and his tail,<BR>
And he knew they would drown him if they should prevail.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;With his cries sore distressed,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;All began to protest,<BR>
But he louder and louder his terrors expressed.<BR>
Though his throat did not burst with the strain of those cries,<BR>
It <I>then grew</I> to be twice its original size!<BR>
And its shape we may see when his sons meet our eyes.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>The man bore up bravely, our old legends say,<BR>
But his flock, grown unruly, gave trouble that day;<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Few cared to obey,<BR>
And each, like the monkey, desired his own way.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>He bade all keep their places till he should have found<BR>
If danger awaited them on the damp ground;<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;And the trumpeter bird<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;With the others then heard,<BR>

<TR><TD>"Yahgahmi, beware!" said the man, with a frown,<BR>
As into a nest of fierce ants he flew down.<BR>
Alas, for the bird! for that raverious swarm,<BR>
Ere the master could capture him, did him great harm,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Each leg was a stick<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;(Though once fairly thick),<BR>
For those ants had deprived it of all they could pick.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Having cleared off the ants, the long-suffering man<BR>
Said, "I'll kindle a fire, if I possibly can."<BR>
The sticks which he carried, though not kept quite dry,<BR>
Would, by friction incessant, yield fire by and by.<BR>
It was kindled at length; and then, while he looked round<BR>
To see if of fuel some kind might be found,<BR>
The "mar&#363;di"<A NAME="page_132_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_132_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A> pecked up the red coal from the ground.<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;And away the bird flew,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;So that no one then knew;<BR>
But, in time, his misfortune they plainly could view;<BR>
For his throat, much inflamed, took a fiery glow<BR>
From the coal he pecked up (for an insect) below.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>The man looked for his fire; and before him then stood<BR>
The first alligator, come forth from the mud.<BR>
That reptile was then well-conducted, they say,<BR>
And had come his respects to the master to pay.<BR>
But the rest, who disliked him, said "<I>He</I> took the fire!"<BR>
And the man, cold and weary, gave way to his ire.<BR>
Forcing open his mouth, to search there (he was wrong),<BR>
Found his tongue in the way&#8212;and he pulled out the tongue!<A NAME="page_132_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_132_note_2"><FONT size=1>2</FONT></A><BR></TD></TR>

The reptile, disgusted, went (<I>tongueless</I>) away;<BR>
