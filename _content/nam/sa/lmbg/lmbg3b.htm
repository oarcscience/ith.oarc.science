<TR><TD>By conquest they the isles possessed,<BR>
Those lesser gems which stud the West.<BR>
Where no male Araw&acirc;ks remained,<BR>

Then, 'gainst the larger islands went&#8212;<BR>
Or to the southern continent&#8212;<BR>
&#8195;Their warriors strong and bold!<BR>
Famous for valour and for wiles,<BR>
Those seas, for near five hundred miles,<BR>
&#8195;Their red Vikings would roam;<BR>
And warlike women guard their isles<BR>
&#8195;While they were far from home.<BR></TD></TR>

But Caribs made a fiercer stand:<BR>
Fighting till death, that for their land<BR>
&#8195;Invaders dear might pay.<BR>
None thought of yielding&#8212;few of flight;<BR>
Then women, maddened with the sight<BR>
&#8195;Of their brave husbands slain,<BR>
Would rush on pikes and swords&#8212;to fight<BR>
&#8195;The battle o'er again!<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Meanwhile their race upon the "main"<BR>
Had fought, supremacy to gain.<BR>
And this became their nation's boast&#8212;<BR>
"From Orinoco to the coast,<BR>
We hold the tribes in terror all,<BR>
And lord it over great and small!"<BR></TD></TR>

Friendship for English Raleigh felt.<BR>
"A naked race," wrote he, "but I<BR>

So on Caronit Corentyn,<BR>
And Essequibo wide between,<BR>
&#8195;His boats might freely go&#8212;<BR>
E'en to white Rupununi's wave:<BR>

But from the Surinam, men say,<BR>
The English twice were driv'n away&#8212;<BR>

Overcoming all resistance,<BR>
&#8195;Smooth and gentle slopes he made.<BR>

Many rocks and cliffs, men say,<BR>
By their power were charmed away.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Thus the earth for habitation<BR>
&#8195;Much more suitable was found:<BR>
Then said he, "Communication<BR>

<I>On them</I> let your traffic be."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Men, who heard him thus advising,<BR>

The English had by that time made a settlement on the Coma, or Surinam, which, in 1667, was exchanged with the Dutch for "New Holland," the present New York. Essequibo and Berbice (now English) were colonised by the Dutch in the early part of the seventeenth century, and remained in their possession nearly two hundred years. Demerara was also founded by them, though at a much later period.</P>

<P>As the Caribs themselves have always been accused of cannibalism, it is but fair to the survivors of that race in Guiana, to say that all those whom I have spoken with deny that their fathers ever were guilty of it, save in mimic action, as a vaunt or threat, to terrify a foe.</P>

<P>Humboldt, who treats the subject fully in his "Narrative," acquits the continental Caribs of the charge, while admitting the cannibalism of the Cabr&eacute;s (as stated above), of various other inland tribes, and of the <I>Caribs of the islands</I> in former days.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_109_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_109_fr_1">1</A> There is an episode, usually given here, of a "cocorite" palm, which mankind strove to ascend, because its top reached the heavens. A poor woman, not in a condition to climb, led the way. When halfway up she was turned into stone by terror and exhaustion. None could help her, and none could pass over her. All who tried to do so became rocks likewise. The terrified survivors then climbed the komoo, and were saved.</P>

<P>Whether the mystery attached to those rude sculptures will ever be solved, <I>even in part</I>, it is at present impossible to say. In the interest of science, it is desirable that a collection of photographs of the most remarkable&#8212;not only on the Orinaco, but (if possible) from the Rio Negro to the Corentyn&#8212;should be made and compared.</P>
