<TR><TD>W<SMALL>HERE</SMALL> Orinoco, through his delta wide,<BR>
By numerous channels, seeks the ocean tide;<BR>
Where, annually, his waters flood the ground,<BR>
And wide lagoons, with muddy isles, abound,<BR>
The fan-like branches of the ita palm<BR>
By thousands wave above his waters calm.<BR>
Those stately trees supply the rude abode<BR>
Which the poor Warau makes above the rising flood.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>That race, of old from other regions driven,<BR>
Could not have lived, but for that shelter given.<BR>
Unwarlike, they could not their foes withstand,<BR>
But had to yield to them the higher land.<BR>
On fish and crabs those Waraus chiefly live,<BR>
Which in abundance there the waters give.<BR>
Their palm-tree<A NAME="page_52_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_52_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A> pith a kind of bread affords,<BR>

<TR><TD>Yet some provision grounds those Waraus have,<BR>
Where land appears above the tidal wave;<BR>
And from their swampy refuges they come,<BR>
Beneath our rule to find a peaceful home.<BR>
>From Orinoco to Moruca's stream,<BR>
More numerous than other tribes they seem.<BR>
And farther east, where ita swamps abound,<BR>
Even in Surinam, the Warau race is found.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>We called the tribes&#8212;a mission space to clear<BR>
At Waramuri, for the Waraus near.<BR>
Unkempt, unclad, their women there we found;<BR>
Their naked children wallowed on the ground,<BR>
With filth and ashes grimed&#8212;sad sight to see:<BR>
We wondered how such way of life could be!<BR>
Most wild and gaunt the men, who took no care,<BR>
And only wished to be&#8212;just what they were.<BR>
Lower than others, as he would allow,<BR>
And satisfied to be so, was the poor Warau!<A NAME="page_53_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_53_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A><BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>T<SMALL>HEIR</SMALL> ancient belief we had long wished to hear:<BR>
Some had said 'twas "romantic," while others said "queer."<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;But, from shyness or fear,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;Till the twenty-first year,<BR>
Of their most knowing sorcerers none would come near.<BR>
Then, at last, a friend told me to send for "McLeod,"<BR>

<BR>
Who to be their <I>most learned</I> by all was allowed.<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;And that Warau of fame<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;(With the highland Scotch name),<BR>
After long hesitation, consented, and came.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>His visit to us was a favour most rare:<BR>
So myself, our good teacher, and other friends there,<BR>
With honour received him, and offered&#8212;a chair.<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;But he sat on the ground,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;With his Waraus around,<BR>
Whose costume was most "light and airy" we found.<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;They&#8212;with long, matted hair,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;And bare skins&#8212;squatted there,<BR>
While their chief a striped shirt condescended to wear.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&#8195;&#8195;Their traditional "word"<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;A good friend there had heard;<BR>
Partly Warau was he, and to him we referred.<BR>
For a mixture most strange through some tales seemed to run;<BR>
Their most serious matters so blended with fun,<BR>
That (though none of the red men there thought it absurd)<BR>
<I>We</I> could scarcely believe it the "Old people's word."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>"Oh tell me, McLeod, did not slaughter and woe<BR>
First cause the Waraus to that swamp-land to go?<BR>
Did you not live inland, where the clear waters flow,<BR>
Ere the fortune of war sternly drove you below?"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>"Stern foes have indeed caused the Waraus to fly:<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;But they first lived on high,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;Above yonder blue sky,<BR>
Ere they came down the good things of this world to try.<BR>

Who thus rashly lost their high station in heaven!"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&#8195;&#8195;We opened our eyes;<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;But he, calm and wise,<BR>
Superior smiled, and enjoyed our surprise.<BR>

LEGEND OF OKONOR&Oacute;T&Eacute;.</H3>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD>"Say, Okonor&oacute;t&eacute;, thou archer so gay,<BR>
With bright feathered ornaments, whither away?<BR>
Let the birds now beware or thy clear, glancing eye;<BR>
For thine arrows bear death to all creatures that fly!"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>"With my arrows so keen I pursue a rare bird,<BR>
Of whose lovely plumage we often have heard;<BR>
That bird I must find, though I cannot tell where;<BR>
But its flesh I must eat, and its plumage must wear."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>So Okonor&oacute;t&eacute; went forth on his way,<BR>
To seek that rare bird with its plumage so gay.<BR>
He could only shoot <I>birds</I>, for above the blue sky<BR>
Were no living creatures, save those that could fly,<BR>
And the young Warau race, who in that high abode<BR>
Had been placed by their Maker, the Wise and the Good.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>That search he engaged in for many a day;<BR>
But still, as it saw him, the bird flew away,<BR>
Till (surely some evil one brought it to pass)<BR>
He saw it alight in a clump of high grass.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>

<!------------------------page 56------------------------>

<A NAME="page_56"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 56</FONT></A>

<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Then, lying flat down, he slid over the ground,<BR>
Like tiger or snake which some victim has found;<BR>
The distance diminished, yet still he crawled on,<BR>
Saying, "Oh for one shot ere the bird shall be gone!"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>At length he had crawled within shot of that bird,<BR>
When lo! it flew up, as some movement it heard.<BR>
With keen arrow transfixed the bright beauty was slain,<BR>
And, with quivering wing, fluttered down to the plain.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Glad Okonor&oacute;t&eacute; sprang up with a bound,<BR>
And, shouting for joy, made the meadows resound.<BR>
"No longer," said he, "need I rise with the sun<BR>
To pursue this bright bird, for my prize now is won!"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Then he searched all the ground&#8212;<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Walked around and around;<BR>
Strange!&#8212;arrow and bird were nowhere to be found!<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Such a loss who could bear?<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;He looked everywhere,<BR>
Till he saw a deep pit, and said, "Both must be there;"<BR>
And the sides being steep, he approached it with care.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>But gone was his arrow for ever and aye;<BR>
Gone too that bright bird with its plumage so gay.<BR>
And he, fascinated, unable to move,<BR>
Saw daylight <I>beneath</I>, him, as well as above!<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;There, far, far below,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;He could see forests grow;<BR>
Wide plains, and savannahs, where rivulets flow.<BR>
And he looked down for hours those new wonders to view,<BR>
Thinking, "All is a <I>dream</I>, sure it cannot be true!<BR>

<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;"Some charm fills mine eye,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Or do I espy<BR>
On the green plains below, <I>living creatures</I> pass by?"<BR>
&#8195;He could see there the deer and the peccary go,<BR>
The choice paca, and others, which now we all know;<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;While birds which soar high,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Rising near to the sky,<BR>
And some, nearer earth, his clear vision could spy!<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=center>*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>"Now hear, Waraus all! You know what I have seen;<BR>
And many here present to view it have been.<BR>
Prepare a rope ladder; I must go below<BR>
And see if those creatures are useful or no.<BR>
If it be as I hope, 'tis our people's great gain,<BR>
And if I lose my life, one man only is slain."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Oh, great was their fear lest his life he should lose;<BR>
But Okonor&oacute;t&eacute; none e'er could refuse.<BR>
So all to the woods, picking cotton, would go,<BR>
For forests of cotton were there, as we know.<BR>
(Perhaps they used "bush-ropes" the cotton to aid).<BR>
It took many months, but the ladder they made.<BR>
It was lengthened above when too short it was found,<BR>
Till it grappled the trees upon this lower ground;<BR>
And it then, tight above, with strong braces was bound.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Bold Okonor&oacute;t&eacute;, determined to go,<BR>
Strong-limbed, and brave-hearted, then ventured below.<BR>
'Twas a perilous venture, to come from above<BR>
By a ladder so frail, which light currents could move.<BR>

<!------------------------page 58------------------------>

<A NAME="page_58"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 58</FONT></A>

<BR>
And when he was down, he stood gazing around<BR>
In utter amazement at all things he found;<BR>
The fire, so abundant, he saw with surprise,<BR>
The quadrupeds strange, and their wonderful size:<BR>
For all seemed most wonderful then to his eyes.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>He must have seen wild beasts devouring their prey,<BR>
For jaguars and snakes then had all their own way.<BR>
And he thought he would venture to taste some large game,<BR>
So he shot a young deer, and soon kindled a flame,<BR>
In the Indian style, with two pieces of wood;<BR>
And the ven'son he found to be excellent food.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Ascending again!&#8212;Oh, what labour and pain<BR>
To the quick-heaving chest!&#8212;to the limbs, what a strain!<BR>
It was hard to come down; but to climb up again!<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;(Though we came from the sky,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;<I>I</I> had rather not try:<BR>
Some people turn giddy when mounting too high.)<BR>
It was done but <I>that once</I>, as you'll find by and by.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>A portion of game he brought up from below;<BR>
Not much, but sufficient his people to show:<BR>
His words (and its flavour) put all in a glow.<BR>
"Oh! we cannot stay here; for there is little good<BR>
In the small birds around us: but animal food<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;We know to abound<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;On that lower ground,<BR>
Which Okonorot&eacute; for Waraus has found!"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>So they asked no permission, but said, "We will go!"<BR>
And came down the rope ladder to this world below.<BR>


<!------------------------page 59------------------------>

<A NAME="page_59"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 59</FONT></A>

<BR>
All things then were young&#8212;no old people were found;<BR>
Small children they carried, and all reached the ground<BR>
In safety, save one&#8212;a poor woman, the last,<BR>
Who got wedged in the hole which the others had passed.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Her husband below her sore trouble could view,<BR>
And climbed back to give help, but could not get her through;<BR>
Then, his head turning giddy, he went down below,<BR>
Where his people all thought it a terrible blow,<BR>
And in clamorous talking gave vent to their woe.<BR>
They all asked how it happened. He could not tell how;<BR>
So the thing was mysterious to ev'ry Warau.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Then the women, upbraiding, would ask, "Is it right<BR>
For that man to come down, and not stay up all night?<BR>
Brave Okonor&oacute;t&eacute;! he climbed up before;<BR>
Will he not go up now, with a man or two more,<BR>
Since the husband, resigned, has quite given it o'er!"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>They all shrunk from the task, for a man there had said,<BR>
Whom they straightway discovered to have a wise head,<BR>
"Supposing you reach her, and can pull her through,<BR>
Will she not be the death of you all, if you do?<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;You will find it no fun&#8212;<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;She will come with a run;<BR>
Consider how you, in that case, can hold on?<BR>
You must be swept off, and our best men be gone."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=center>*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*</TD></TR>

<!------------------------page 60------------------------>

<A NAME="page_60"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 60</FONT></A>

<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>So the woman remains (though the ladder gave way),<BR>
And will always remain there, our old Waraus say,<BR>
<I>She fills up the hole</I>; and, good friends, that is why<BR>
We never can get a <I>fair peep though the sky!</I>"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>He paused. Some were laughing, and all the rest smiled<BR>
At a "descent from heaven" so grotesque and wild,<BR>
Then the old Warau said, "You all think I 'make fun;'<BR>
But it is in <I>this way</I> that the legend must run,<BR>
And so I must tell it. If not, I have done!"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Being soothed, he resumed, in a different tone,<BR>
For the course of his legends more serious had grown.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>The honey he found, and soon robbed the poor bees<BR>

As she had been cross in the morning, at night<BR>
She became doubly kind, just to put matters right.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>But the young man was gloomy, and wrapped up in thought;<BR>

It suited his purpose, and forthwith he made<BR>

<TR><TD>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;It fell on her head,<BR>

And then he remembered her words, "The wide sea;"<BR>
Oh, how can I cross it, that I may be free?"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>He thought on all ways which the Waraus then knew<BR>
To float on the deep, and found none that would do.<BR>
There were then logs of wood on which men used to go,<BR>
With their feet hanging down in the water below;<BR>
And rafts of light branches, which sometimes were made,<BR>
When over smooth streams they their children conveyed.<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;But rafts of light wood<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Could by no means have stood,<BR>
Or danced over the waves of that great rolling flood.<BR>
And he saw that for his purpose they were not good.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>The half of a gourd he could readily float,<BR>
But its shape, he soon found, would not do for a boat.<BR>
>From an oblong seed-pod his best model he drew,<BR>
Which he strove to improve by all methods he knew.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>He formed a large vessel of wax&#8212;which, though drained<BR>
Of its former contents, in abundance remained;<BR>
He improved on its shape till our people might view<BR>
What they call "woib&aacute;ka," but others "canoe."<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Then his frail craft be tried<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;At the next "waterside;"<BR>
But his mistress came there, and severely she eyed&#8212;<BR>
Then broke it, and scattered the wax far and wide!<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Determined to go, though in waxen canoe,<BR>
(He dared not work in <I>wood</I>, which far better would do).<BR>
He sought a young cousin, whom "brother" we call,<BR>
And begged him to help him, whate'er might befall.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;"Abor&eacute;, with thee<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;I will brave the salt sea.<BR>
I should fear to remain, lest she next bewitch me!<BR>
We will work in the bush, where no Warau can see."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>They must have used then a stone chisel or axe,<BR>
To cut wood, to make paddles, or strengthen the wax.<BR>
Food, and gourds to hold water, they had to provide,<BR>
Though forced, for the time, their equipment to hide.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Abor&eacute; then thought, "If Wowt&aacute;h chance to spy<BR>
Our flight, she will stay me with her evil eye.<BR>
I must prevent that, or, at least, <I>I will try</I>."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>So he took her a nest of fine honey to see;<BR>
Which was deep in the heart of a large hollow tree;<BR>
He'd before taken care a great wedge to prepare,<BR>
Which he drove tightly in, and Wowt&aacute;h was kept there,<BR>
Whose great love of sweets led her into the snare.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;"Now, now we must fly&#8212;<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;To look back is to spy,<BR>
And be fixed by the power of that evil eye!<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Brother, off and away;<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Let us launch while we may!<BR>
We must pull for our lives now by night and by day."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>"Ho, Waraus!" he then to his countrymen cried,<BR>
Who that waxen craft with astonishment eyed;<BR>
"<I>This, this</I> is the shape which your vessels must have,<BR>
With <I>this</I> they will readily dance o'er the wave.<BR>
Observe well <I>this form</I>, you will all find it good;<BR>
Make your woib&aacute;kas so, friends; but make them of <I>wood</I>."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Thus be quitted the strand<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Of our poor Warau land.<BR>
Men and women, regretting, were ranged on the sand.<BR>

Not in such strips of bark as we're forced to wear now,<BR>
With a few shells and teeth strung to make a small show;<BR>
But in fair woven fibres from shoulder to toe.<BR>
And now&#8212;how to make such, we never may know."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>No mercy was shown, though she still made her moan;<BR>
And she found by the silence the people were gone.<BR>

But ever since that she has gone to and fro.<BR>
Of late in the swamps, o'er our evening fire,<BR>
We talked of Abor&eacute;, when nigher and nigher<BR>
She came. We all knew by the sad croak she gave;<BR>
And we said, "She still grieves for her runaway slave!"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><H4 ALIGN="center"><A NAME="pp_12"></A>SEQUEL TO THE ANCIENT LEGEND.</H4></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>We offered our thanks to our old Warau friend,<BR>
And thought that his story there came to an end&#8212;<BR>
As doubtless it did, in the ages long past,<BR>
But he said, "Waraus heard of Abor&eacute; at last.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>"He went o'er a smooth sea; and, ere long, be found land&#8212;<BR>
Some island&#8212;and landed upon that new strand.<BR>
There, discarding the wax, he a craft made of wood,<BR>
And visited places, just as he thought good.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>At last he arrived where white people abound,<BR>
Whom poor and distressed above all men be found.<BR>
They did support life, he could hardly tell how;<BR>
Far more wretched were they than the lowest Warau.<BR>
When he saw them his heart with compassion flowed o'er,<BR>
And he said, 'I will make my abode on this shore.'"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>So he made up his mind the white people to raise;<BR>
And the way be has done so deserves their best praise.<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;They, squalid and bare,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Had no garments to wear,<BR>
Till taught by Abor&eacute; good clothes to prepare.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>He taught the white people to weave and to sew,<BR>
To be skilful in wood and in iron, we know,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;From a nail to a gun.&#8212;<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;(Ah, you may think it fun&#8212;<BR>
But you <I>owe to Abor&eacute;</I> the things you have done!)<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;And to this pray attend!<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;To the <I>whole world a friend</I>,<BR>
The good things he had made in large ships he would send.<BR>
He thus obtained wealth, though he cared not for pelf,<BR>
But strove to help others while helping himself.<BR>
He improved the rough plan of his first waxen boat<BR>
To the huge ships we see now&#8212;great monsters afloat&#8212;<BR>
Which bring you all things, from a pin to a coat.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>'Tis said that Abor&eacute; still lives, though no tree<BR>
That grows in our woods can be older than he.<BR>
The magical power which, when he was young,<BR>
That spirit imparted, has made his life long,<BR>
If he were to return she would claim him again;<BR>
So he's <I>forced</I> in the white people's land to remain.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Yet presents he used to send every year;<BR>
>From the time the Dutch told him they found Waraus here.<BR>
Those presents <I>they</I> gave in their colony's name;<BR>
That was nonsense! <I>We knew</I> from Abor&eacute; they came.<BR>
But they all at once ceased, and <I>some must be to blame</I>.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>We think that in Georgetown they still are received;<BR>
That he would cease to send them cannot be believed.<BR>
Knife and gun, ammunition, a cutlass and hoe,<BR>
Rum, needles and pins, with some coarse calico,<BR>
Were once freely given to each. Alas! <I>now</I><BR>
There is <I>payment</I> demanded from ev'ry Warau!"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>The presents here mentioned, as every year made,<BR>
Were the price of assistance to Indians paid.<BR>
When slavery ceas'd their help was not required,<BR>
So the custom of annual "presents" expired.<BR>

<BR>
No loss to the Indians, but great moral gain;<BR>
For now they must <I>work</I> for the goods they obtain.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Such opinion may be<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Held by you or by me,<BR>
But with that the old Warau would never agree.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>We gave him some clothes; he had earned them full well;<BR>
Having come six days' voyage these legends to tell.<BR>
And we strove in his language Christ's words to explain,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;That some better gain<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;He might thereby obtain;<BR>
But in Warau traditions he chose to remain.<BR>
He returned to his place near the Barima's shore,<BR>
And we saw old "McLeod" at our missions no more.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>The creed of his race he had shown in these tales;<BR>
Shown, too, how their faith in strange spirits prevails.<BR>
In <I>their</I> service alone the Waraus used to live;<BR>
But now to their Maker due worship they give.<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Though the bones which we found<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;In the cannibal mound<BR>
Made them think Waramuri a weird haunted ground;<BR>
<I>Now</I> around that huge heap Christian Waraus abound.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>And civilisation first showed itself there,<BR>
In their women's neat hair and the clothing they wear.<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;For much better off now,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;As all races allow,<BR>
Than his forefathers were, is the Christian Warau.<BR></TD></TR>
