 The Caribs, when discovered by Columbus, were in possession of the
smaller West Indian islands, and had begun to attack the larger.

 Of their origin nothing certain is known. Humboldt states that the
opinion common amongst Europeans in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries was that they came from the vicinity of Darien, and that more
recently they were supposed to have come from the northern continent.

 But the constant tradition of the *Caribs themselves*, both in the
islands and on the main, claims *Guiana* as the cradle of their race,
and the *Orinoco* as the point from which they started on their career
of conquest.

 A comparison of their language with that of the Orinoco Tamanacs, and
with that of the Chaymas to the north of that river, will confirm, as
far as language can, the truth of their tradition.
