With filth and ashes grimed—sad sight to see:<br />
We wondered how such way of life could be!<br />
Most wild and gaunt the men, who took no care,<br />
And only wished to be—just what they were.<br />
Lower than others, as he would allow,<br />
And satisfied to be so, was the poor Warau!<span id="page_53_fr_1"></span><a href="#page_53_note_1">1</a><br />

Of their most knowing sorcerers none would come near.<br />
Then, at last, a friend told me to send for "McLeod,"<br />

So myself, our good teacher, and other friends there,<br />

Whose costume was most "light and airy" we found.<br />

While their chief a striped shirt condescended to wear.<br />

That (though none of the red men there thought it absurd)<br />

Such, such is the tale of our forefathers given,<br />
Who thus rashly lost their high station in heaven!"<br />

To seek that rare bird with its plumage so gay.<br />
He could only shoot <em>birds</em>, for above the blue sky<br />
Were no living creatures, save those that could fly,<br />
And the young Warau race, who in that high abode<br />
Had been placed by their Maker, the Wise and the Good.<br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">

But still, as it saw him, the bird flew away,<br />

</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>At length he had crawled within shot of that bird,<br />
When lo! it flew up, as some movement it heard.<br />
With keen arrow transfixed the bright beauty was slain,<br />
And, with quivering wing, fluttered down to the plain.<br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Glad Okonoróté sprang up with a bound,<br />
And, shouting for joy, made the meadows resound.<br />
"No longer," said he, "need I rise with the sun<br />
To pursue this bright bird, for my prize now is won!"<br />
</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>   Then he searched all the ground—<br />
   Walked around and around;<br />
Strange!—arrow and bird were nowhere to be found!<br />
   Such a loss who could bear?<br />

Till he saw a deep pit, and said, "Both must be there;"<br />
And the sides being steep, he approached it with care.<br />
</td>

Gone too that bright bird with its plumage so gay.<br />
And he, fascinated, unable to move,<br />
Saw daylight <em>beneath</em>, him, as well as above!<br />
   There, far, far below,<br />
   He could see forests grow;<br />
Wide plains, and savannahs, where rivulets flow.<br />
And he looked down for hours those new wonders to view,<br />
Thinking, "All is a <em>dream</em>, sure it cannot be true!<br />
<span id="page_57">p. 57</span><br />
   "Some charm fills mine eye,<br />
   Or do I espy<br />
On the green plains below, <em>living creatures</em> pass by?"<br />

The choice paca, and others, which now we all know;<br />
   While birds which soar high,<br />
   Rising near to the sky,<br />
And some, nearer earth, his clear vision could spy!<br />

If it be as I hope, 'tis our people's great gain,<br />
And if I lose my life, one man only is slain."<br />
</td>

<tr class="odd">

But Okonoróté none e'er could refuse.<br />
So all to the woods, picking cotton, would go,<br />
For forests of cotton were there, as we know.<br />
(Perhaps they used "bush-ropes" the cotton to aid).<br />
It took many months, but the ladder they made.<br />
It was lengthened above when too short it was found,<br />
Till it grappled the trees upon this lower ground;<br />
And it then, tight above, with strong braces was bound.<br />
</td>

Strong-limbed, and brave-hearted, then ventured below.<br />
'Twas a perilous venture, to come from above<br />
By a ladder so frail, which light currents could move.<br />
<span id="page_58">p. 58</span><br />
And when he was down, he stood gazing around<br />
In utter amazement at all things he found;<br />
The fire, so abundant, he saw with surprise,<br />
The quadrupeds strange, and their wonderful size:<br />
For all seemed most wonderful then to his eyes.<br />
</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>He must have seen wild beasts devouring their prey,<br />
For jaguars and snakes then had all their own way.<br />
And he thought he would venture to taste some large game,<br />
So he shot a young deer, and soon kindled a flame,<br />
In the Indian style, with two pieces of wood;<br />
And the ven'son he found to be excellent food.<br />

To the quick-heaving chest!—to the limbs, what a strain!<br />
It was hard to come down; but to climb up again!<br />

Some people turn giddy when mounting too high.)<br />
It was done but <em>that once</em>, as you'll find by and by.<br />

<td>A portion of game he brought up from below;<br />
Not much, but sufficient his people to show:<br />
His words (and its flavour) put all in a glow.<br />
"Oh! we cannot stay here; for there is little good<br />
In the small birds around us: but animal food<br />
   We know to abound<br />
   On that lower ground,<br />
Which Okonoroté for Waraus has found!"<br />
</td>

<tr class="even">

And came down the rope ladder to this world below.<br />
<span id="page_59">p. 59</span><br />
All things then were young—no old people were found;<br />
Small children they carried, and all reached the ground<br />
In safety, save one—a poor woman, the last,<br />
Who got wedged in the hole which the others had passed.<br />
</td>

<tr class="odd">

And climbed back to give help, but could not get her through;<br />
Then, his head turning giddy, he went down below,<br />
Where his people all thought it a terrible blow,<br />
And in clamorous talking gave vent to their woe.<br />
They all asked how it happened. He could not tell how;<br />
So the thing was mysterious to ev'ry Warau.<br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Then the women, upbraiding, would ask, "Is it right<br />
For that man to come down, and not stay up all night?<br />
Brave Okonoróté! he climbed up before;<br />
Will he not go up now, with a man or two more,<br />
Since the husband, resigned, has quite given it o'er!"<br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>They all shrunk from the task, for a man there had said,<br />
Whom they straightway discovered to have a wise head,<br />
"Supposing you reach her, and can pull her through,<br />
Will she not be the death of you all, if you do?<br />
   You will find it no fun—<br />
   She will come with a run;<br />
Consider how you, in that case, can hold on?<br />
You must be swept off, and our best men be gone."<br />
