<TR><TD>H<SMALL>OIST</SMALL> again the red cross! Let us voyage once more<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Where the wild torrents roar,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;As we haul the boat o'er:<BR>
And our red men all point as they paddle away,<BR>
To where the grim cayman is lurking for prey,<BR>
&#8195;Midst the sandbanks and rocks by the shore.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>We encamp ere the sun quits the evening sky,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Or the night-birds flit by<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;With their strangely-weird cry:<BR>
And our Indians join in our evening prayer,<BR>
Make their camp-fires and sup&#8212;to their hammocks repair,<BR>
&#8195;And tell tales till the moon riseth high.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Oh, strange are the legends in which they delight!<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Some tell how each sprite,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;In the "merrie moonlight,"<BR>
With his comrades (as animals) joins in the dance.<BR>
Such are not malignant, though sometimes, perchance,<BR>
&#8195;Human beings they sorely affright.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Of some pillar-like rocks, which the traveller sees,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;They will say, "They were trees<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Which once waved in the breeze."<BR>
And of others, like men or strange animals shown,<BR>
Say, "They once lived and moved, but are turned into stone,<BR>
&#8195;Having failed the Great Spirit to please!"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>And he who would win those wild people should know<BR>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD>"O<SMALL>H</SMALL>, what mean these croaks, like a concert of frogs,<BR>
Such as we, oftentimes, near our marshes and bogs,<BR>
&#8195;May hear at still evening's close?"<BR>
"'Tis the chorus to one of our popular tales,<BR>
Levelled at a division of race which prevails,<BR>
&#8195;And pretending to show how it rose."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><H5 ALIGN="center">THE LEGEND.</H5></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>"Come with us, O Bahmoo, to hunt the huge frogs,<BR>
Which are found nowhere else in our rivers and bogs:<BR>
Good food; though in size they approach the bush-hogs:<BR>
&#8195;Some excellent sport you may find."<BR>


<!------------------------page 168------------------------>

<A NAME="page_168"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 168</FONT></A>

<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Thus our young men addressed<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Their friend Bahmoo, a guest,<BR>
Who had come to their "place" of adventures in quest,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;And, perhaps, of a wife to his mind.<BR>
For, as you may know, our young men often rove<BR>
A long distance in search of a girl they can love.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>And now these young hunters set forth on their way;<BR>
Each one with his weapons and ornaments gay.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>"Take a cudgel, O Bahmoo!" said they, "if you go,<BR>
For those creatures are sturdy, and take a hard blow."<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Then answered Bahmoo,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;"I leave weapons to you,<BR>
And tell you beforehand what <I>I</I> mean to do.<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;The first frog that is found<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Upon yon marshy ground,<BR>
I will jump on his back, and will twist his neck round,<BR>
And so kill him without more ado!"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD align=center>*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Now the chief of those frogs was a spirit, they say,<BR>
Who o'erheard Bahmoo's boast, and forthwith, in the way,<BR>
Full of fun, near the river, he squatted or lay.<BR>
There he seemed half asleep; while around him awoke<BR>
A deafening chorus of croak upon croak.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Our young men, well used to it, were not afraid,<BR>
But Bahmoo half shrunk from the row those frogs made,<BR>
&#8195;It was such a wild hullabaloo.<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;As from each monstrous throat<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Pealed the long rolling note;<BR>


<!------------------------page 169------------------------>

<A NAME="page_169"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 169</FONT></A>

<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;And he heard it resound,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Far and near, all around,<BR>
&#8195;"Boro-ohk," dying off in "boro-oo!"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>When the boaster looked grave, it was thought a good joker<BR>
And his comrades enjoyed it. Although no one spoke,<BR>
&#8195;He knew they were laughing aside.<BR>
So he ran at that first frog, and sprang on his back,<BR>
And, to twist round his head, threw his arms round his neck,<BR>
&#8195;And then&#8212;found himself in the tide!<BR>
For the frog-chief, returning his ardent embrace,<BR>
Said," Come, my dear friend, with me, home to my place,<BR>
&#8195;Just to <I>see</I> it, if not to abide."<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Then he sprang off the ground,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;And with wonderful bound<BR>
And a splash, that was heard a long distance around,<BR>
&#8195;They plunged in where the deep waters glide.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Bahmoo tried to escape, but the frolicsome sprite,<BR>
Which possessed that huge frog, in his paws held him tight;<BR>
&#8195;And, when they emerged from below,<BR>
He said," Mount on my back, it is much the best way,<BR>
And we will enjoy ourselves this pleasant day,<BR>
&#8195;As over the river we go.<BR>
We will sing, as we swim along, merry and gay:<BR>
And my people, as chorus, shall join in the lay,<BR>
&#8195;Each chanting his loud 'boro-oo.'"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>So each neighbouring frog lifts his head from the tide,<BR>
And the others respond from the banks, far and wide;<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;At the voice of their king<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;They all merrily sing&#8212;<BR>
&#8195;"Boro-ohk, boro-ohk, boro-oo!"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>

<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>But meanwhile, Bahmoo's comrades, pray what have they done?<BR>
Well, at first I must say that they thought it no fun:<BR>
&#8195;To see their friend caught by the frog.<BR>
But as soon as they saw him upon the frog's back,<BR>
With loud peals of laughter, they cried, "Twist his neck,<BR>
&#8195;And bring him here dead as a log.<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Then, when he is dead,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;And you've done what you said,<BR>
Of all our bold hunters we'll make you the head,<BR>
&#8195;Our champion in forest and bog!"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;'Twas severe, I must own;<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;But 'tis very well known,<BR>
That to braggarts <I>who fail</I> little mercy is shown.<BR>
And so Bahmoo, when mocked by the frogs' "boro-oo,"<BR>
Heard his comrades laugh loudly, and join in it too.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>At length he arrived at the opposite shore;<BR>
The frog had sung merrily all the way o'er<BR>
&#8195;(Such a jolly old frog none e'er knew).<BR>
"You see I have carried you safely," said he.<BR>
"How pleasant to swim in such good company!"<BR>
&#8195;Then o'er his head Bahmoo he threw,<BR>
Saying, "Though it be painful to part, I must go,<BR>
For your people are killing mine yonder, I know.<BR>
&#8195;Adieu, my good Bahmoo, adieu!"<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>He then dived below; the man saw him no more,<BR>
But remained there alone on that desolate shore.<BR>


<!------------------------page 171------------------------>

<A NAME="page_171"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 171</FONT></A>

<BR>
When the young men had finished their frog-hunt, they hailed<BR>
For Bahmoo to swim back; but entreaties all failed<BR>
&#8195;To draw him from that other side.<BR>
He dreaded their laughter, and would not again<BR>
&#8195;Adventure himself in the tide,<BR>
Lest that frog he should meet. So he had to remain,<BR>
&#8195;And there for himself to provide.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>"And that is the reason," our old people say,<BR>
"Why his children are separate from us this day."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>"His children? Why, where could Bahmoo find a bride?"<BR>
"Well, most likely he'd found one ere quitting our side,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Who would not quite approve<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;That the man of her love<BR>
Should be there day and night quite alone.<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;She might not have a boat,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;But a 'woodskin' will float,<BR>
Which her woman's wit would most surely provide;<BR>
And, paddling herself, she would be at his side.<BR>
&#8195;Woman's love greater wonders has done,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;And few things, we find,<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Will deter woman-kind,<BR>
When once it has thoroughly made up its mind,<BR>
&#8195;As the wisest of Indians own."<A NAME="page_171_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_171_note_1"><FONT size=1>1</FONT></A><BR></TD></TR>

<H3 ALIGN="center"><A NAME="pp_3"></A>LEGEND OF THE HAIARRI ROOT.</H3>

<TABLE align=center cellpadding=10>

<TR><TD>A<SMALL>N</SMALL> old man, who often caught fish in the river,<BR>
&#8195;Would take his boy with him his fortune to try;<BR>
And the father, with wonder, observed that wherever<BR>
&#8195;The boy swam about, there the fishes would die.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>But as, after cooking, he safely could eat them,<BR>
&#8195;He took the lad with him to bathe day by day:<BR>
Till the fish knew his plans, and, resolved to defeat them,<BR>
&#8195;They made up their minds the young swimmer to slay.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>They cared not attack him, of course, in the water;<BR>
&#8195;To venture <I>there</I> near him would never have done.<BR>
But they chose an old log as the scene of the slaughter,<BR>
&#8195;Where he, after swimming, would bask in the sun.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>There the fish which had spines all sprang rapidly o'er him,<BR>
&#8195;And each struck his spine in the youth as he lay;<BR>
But, worse than all wounds from the others before him,<BR>
&#8195;And <I>fatal</I>, was that of the deadly sting-ray.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>When the father his son through the forest was bearing,<BR>
&#8195;The dying youth saw his blood drop on the ground;<BR>
And he said, "Father, watch for strange plants here appearing;<BR>
&#8195;My blood will take root, and avengers abound."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Thus was found the <I>Haiarri</I>, which, washed after bruising,<BR>
&#8195;In pools or small streams, makes the fishes our prey.<BR>
Think on what <I>the fish gained</I>, when the roots you are using,<BR>
&#8195;Or when anger tempts you a foeman to slay!<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>T<SMALL>HE</SMALL> birds with mankind once their forces combined<BR>
&#8195;An immense water serpent to slay,<BR>
Who was fond of all creatures&#8212;and those he could find<BR>
&#8195;Would embrace, in his own pressing way.<BR>
Beasts and birds, human beings, with him all <I>went down</I>;<BR>
So the men came to kill him from each little town.<BR>
Their gay feathers and paint made a glorious show,<BR>
And each warrior was eager to strike the first blow;<BR>
&#8195;While the birds came to help in the fray.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>They all promised his skin to whoe'er should begin,<BR>
&#8195;And make him come out of his pool;<BR>
But every warrior they asked to step in<BR>
&#8195;Said he fought "<I>upon land</I>&#8212;as a rule."<BR>
Then came forth the cormorant chief, who could see<BR>
In the deep the snake's neck round the root of a tree.<BR>
Darting down, he drove through it an arrow he bore<BR>
(Which had a line tied to a tree on the shore),<BR>
&#8195;Emerging triumphant and cool.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Then, with many a shout, the men capered about,<BR>
&#8195;And began <I>very gently</I> to haul;<BR>
Then more strongly; but still the snake would not come out&#8212;<BR>
&#8195;He seemed fixed there, like any stone wall.<BR>
When forced out at length by his horrible wound,<BR>
His tail made the warriors all scamper around,<BR>
While the birds in wide circles seemed whirled by the wind.<BR>
But he had to give in; and was finally skinned,<BR>
&#8195;'Midst the shouts and wild cries of them all.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>That struggle took place on the Cako, men say;<BR>
Where the snake's length is marked on the rocks to this day.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><H5 ALIGN="center">II.</H5></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>When the cormorant chief claimed the skin as his prize,<BR>
The chief or the warriors affected surprise,<BR>
And said, "We might <I>give</I> you the skin, as you say,<BR>
But how are you going to bear it away?<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Just try, if you please!"<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;"With much pleasure and ease!"<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;The bold water-bird said;<BR>
&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Then he lifted the head<BR>
As a sign to the others, who knew what he meant,<BR>
And swooped down on the skin with a rapid descent;<BR>
Each seized on its margin, beginning to fly,<BR>
And the skin, like a banner, went streaming on high!<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>But the warriors, disgusted, used very strong words,<BR>
And have, since that time, become hostile to birds.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>&nbsp;<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><H5 ALIGN="center">III.</H5></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>The birds flew to a place quite secluded, and there<BR>
Their leader said, "Comrades, this spoil we will share:<BR>
So let each take the part which he happened to bear."<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Now the skin was most brilliant, red, yellow, and green,<BR>
Black and white, in such patterns as never were seen.<BR>
So, delighted, each bird took what happened to come,<BR>
Which he placed on his shoulders to bear safely home.<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Then a wonder ensued! Birds of soberest hue<BR>
Became of those colours, white, yellow, and blue!<BR>
Parrots then were first seen dressed in red and in green,<BR>

And macaws in such plumage as never had been,<BR>
Scarlet, purple, and gold! But what more need I say,<BR>
When we see them fly past us in beauty each day?<BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>As it happens with men&#8212;when brave warriors who toil,<BR>
And go through all the danger, get <I>least of the spoil</I>&#8212;<BR>
Even so&#8212;to the champion, who thus adorned all.<BR>
The <I>snake's head</I>, with its sombre tints, happened to fall.<BR>

Saying, "For an old diver it does very well!"<BR></TD></TR>

They belonged to the last generation, and both became Christian converts. The former would attack any jaguar, and cleave his skull with axe or cutlass. Of the skill and daring displayed by the latter in the capture of a kolokon&#257;ro snake, with only a cord and forked stick, the writer was an eye-witness.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_178_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_178_fr_1">1</A> From the "Ebes&#333;tu" (<I>changed</I> or <I>transformed</I>), heroine of the above legend, the Ebesoana (Araw&acirc;k family) take their name.</P>

<P>The names of those families all descend in the <I>female</I> line, and no individual was permitted to marry another of the same family name.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_179_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_179_fr_1">1</A> From the above union, the existing Demar&eacute;na (Araw&acirc;k family) are supposed to have sprung. They bear, of course, their mother's family name; and in ancient days considered it "the correct thing," in accordance with the legend, to intermarry solely with their father's family&#8212;the "Koroboh&aacute;na."</P>

<P>These latter have a strange legend of their own. They believe that they originally came from above the clouds. The weight of a heavy woman broke the rope by which they were descending; and communication was thus cut off between those who had reached the ground and those remaining above. The Great Spirit, pitying the latter, supplied them with wings and plumage; and they came down, to colonise the trees above the heads of their brethren&#8212;still privileged to live near, and to converse with them, though changed into "Koriouka" <I>parrots</I>.</P>

<P>This legend, though grotesque, affords another instance of the belief (which our pages have shown) expressed by various myths, but almost universal amongst the aboriginal races of Guiana: of a <I>descent</I> from a <I>higher</I> region, or state of existence.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_181_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_181_fr_1">1</A> "Walyarima" is the name of the animal whose appearance was assumed by the lover while swimming the river. "To-eybor&#333;ri" and "To-eyza" are titles, denoting authority, masculine and feminine respectively. The <I>proper names</I> seem to have been lost in the lapse of years.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_186_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_186_fr_1">1</A> This agrees with the old legends, told to Raleigh and others. But many Indians now say that the male infants were <I>always</I> destroyed, and their fathers warned <I>not to return</I>, on pain of death.</P>

<P>With regard to the subject in general. The expeditions for war and plunder, so common nmongst the South American tribes in former ages, would often draw away all the males in a district capable of bearing arms, and sometimes they <I>never returned</I>. The women, left by themselves,

<A NAME="footnotes_page_187"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 187</FONT></A>

drew together for mutual defence; and being, in those days, all well trained to the bow, would (like the women of the Caribi islands) defend their homes and children fiercely agninst all comers.</P>

<P>Such a state of things&#8212;said still to exist in some wild regions of that vast continent&#8212;will account for the tales of Orellana and others, of their <I>fights with Amazons</I>.</P>

<P>It does not, of course, account for the murder of husbands, and utter rejection of marital authority, in the legend before us. Whether that tale ever had any foundation in fact, it is impossible to say. Wild and unnatural as it is, it has deeply impressed the minds of the Aborigines; and the writer has, in his researches, come upon various legends (both tragical and comical) founded on the <I>scarcity of wives</I>, after their (supposed) terrible Exodus.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_187_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_187_fr_1">1</A> The spotted "arua" (or harua) of the Araw&acirc;ks, spelt <I>jaguar</I> by the Spanish discoverers, is commonly called "tiger" by the colonists who frequent the bush. It is called "tobi" by the Waraus, and "kaikusi" by the Caribs and Acawoios.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_190_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_190_fr_1">1</A> The native ideas respecting the constellations differ widely from ours. For instance, the Southern Cross is supposed, by many clans, to represent a "paui" bird resting on a tree. The star, <I>Beta Centauri</I>, is a hunter stealthily approaching it. <I>Alpha Centauri</I> is the hunter's torch (or firebrand), held <I>behind him</I>, so as not to alarm the bird by its glare. Some call it another hunter, lighting the first. Other constellations have <I>narratives</I> connected with them; of these, "Serikoai," the legend given here, is the most interesting specimen.</P>
