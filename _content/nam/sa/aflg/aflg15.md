   <span id="pp_243"></span>**243.**[\*](#pp_243) Special precautions
have to be taken when any large animal has been slain, to protect the
hunter from any harm that might be expected from the Spirit of the
animal he has just destroyed ([Sect. *129*](aflg08.htm#pp_129)). Thus,
when a big snake or other large animal is killed, arrows are stuck into
the ground in the middle of the pathway leading from the place of
destruction toward the house, with a view to preventing the Spirit of
the beast coming to do the slayer or his family any hurt. The peculiar
arrangement of the pointed sticks which Barrington Brown described from
the Emoy River between Enaco and Taiepong villages toward the upper
Potaro, probably served a similar purpose: "In many places on the path
we had to step over arrangements of little sharpened sticks, placed
loosely together in a <span id="page_294">p. 294</span> variety of ways.
These, the guide said, were put by the Indians using this path for the
purpose of keeping the pumas and jaguars from traversing it. These
sticks were not meant to injure the animals, in fact they were too
loosely stuck up for that, but were merely intended by their artificial
appearance to scare off the tigers" (Bro, 198). The pointed hardwood
sticks, stuck into the ground, guarding the pathways leading to the
houses of the Akawaios (Ba, 268-9), of the Oyapock River Indians (Cr,
169), and others, may have been employed for corresponding reasons,
although other reasons have been given. The same may be said of the
following: "Before leaving a temporary camp in the forest, where they
have killed a tapir and dried the meat on a babracot, Indians invariably
destroy this babracot, saying that should a tapir, passing that way,
find traces of the slaughter of one of his kind, he would come by night
on the next occasion, when Indians slept at that place, and, taking a
man, would babracote him in revenge" (IT, 352). In Cayenne, between the
upper Yary and Parou Rivers, Crévaux (252) makes this interesting note:
"I see ten boucans disposed in a line along the pathway. What puzzles me
is that there is no fire beneath. Another thing, instead of being
charged with smoked meat, they are covered with several billets of dry
wood alternating with stones. I learn that these altars . . . have been
made by ten hunters of a neighboring village who started some days ago
on a big expedition. Every time the Roucouyennes go hunting (shooting
with arrows) the quatta monkey, they stop to trim these boucans."<span
id="page_294_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_294_note_1)

   <span id="pp_244"></span>**244.**[\*](#pp_244) An Indian must never
himself bring into the house any game that he has caught, but leave it
for his wife to carry in if she has been accompanying him; otherwise he
will place it on the pathway, some four roods or so from the house,
whence the women-folk will fetch it. Pitou gives a very interesting
example of this from Cayenne (LAP, <span class="small">II</span>, 220,
et seq.). Similarly, with fish—unless very small, or unless there is
only a single one that he can carry on the stick with which he has
skewered its gills—he never brings them into the house, but makes his
wife go fetch them from the waterside. The reason given for this custom
is that, were the food to be brought home direct by the man he would
have bad luck in fishing or hunting on the next occasion. A similar
practice is recorded from Cayenne and from the islands. When the men
(Roucouyennes) return from the chase, they bring the game as far as the
edge of the forest, whither the women go to fetch it (Cr, 283). Carib
Island women go and fetch the venison from the spot where it has fallen,
and the fish on the <span id="page_295">p. 295</span> banks of the
stream (RoP, 493). When they have caught anything, they leave it on the
spot, and the women were formerly obliged to go and fetch it to the
house.

   <span id="pp_245"></span>**245.**[\*](#pp_245) Among the Pomeroon
Arawaks, when an animal is killed with an arrow-trap or a gun-trap, its
flesh has to be cooked in a pot without a cover, over a fire which is
not too large, so as to avoid any water boiling over. Were either of
these matters not attended to, there would be no further use either for
the arrow or for the gun, as all the game of the same kind as that
recently trapped would take its departure to another region.

   <span id="pp_246"></span>**246.**[\*](#pp_246) Among the Arawaks it
would seem that food in general was not allowed to be eaten after
nightfall, any person guilty of this offence being invariably changed
into an animal. The story of the man who dined after dark ([Sect.
*114*](aflg08.htm#pp_114)) has reference to this belief. The origin of
such a custom it is somewhat difficult to trace. That it can not be due
to any desire to prevent exposure to the enemy through the lights of the
fires required for cooking is evident from the fact that fires for
purposes of warmth, protection from jaguars, and other beasts of prey
may be kept burning all night. It may be due to some such superstition
as is met with among the Jivaros of the Pintuc, the Piojés of the
Putumayo (upper Amazon), and others, who argue that all food which
remains in the stomach overnight is unwholesome and undigested, and
should therefore be removed; accordingly they have the habit of inducing
vomiting every morning by the use of a feather (AS, 93).

   <span id="pp_247"></span>**247.**[\*](#pp_247) On the Amazons, "the
children, more particularly the females, are restricted to a particular
food: they are not allowed to eat the meat of any kind of game, nor of
fish, except the very small bony kinds; their food principally
consisting of mandiocca-cake and fruits" (ARW, 345). We must accept with
caution the opinion implied or expressed by various authorities that
each nation as such differs from the others with respect to the
indigenous foods from the use of which the people abstain. A certain
food may be taboo to any one or more individuals, independently of
membership in a certain tribe, at the instigation of a medicine-man as a
part of the treatment for illness, on account of his wife's condition,
or for other reasons. While we have the definite assurance of Schomburgk
that the Caribs never eat monkeys (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>,
434), Gumilla says that each nation is fond of one kind of monkey but
loathes the others. The Achaguas are very fond of the yellow ones, which
they call *arabata*, the Tunevos like the black ones, while the Jiraras,
Ayricos, Betoyes, and other nations prefer the white ones (G, <span
class="small">I</span>, 260). The present-day Pomeroon Caribs will eat
neither armadillo, alligator, camudi, nor monkey, but no reasons for
such restrictions are obtainable. Kappler speaks of the Surinam Indians
refusing <span id="page_296">p. 296</span> to eat snakes and large
sea-turtles (AK, 188). "All tribes . . . agree in refusing to eat the
flesh of such animals as are not indigenous to their country but were
introduced from abroad, such as oxen, sheep \[pigs\], goats, and fowls;
. . . It must, however, be added that, under great pressure of
circumstances, such as utter want of other food, these meats are
occasionally rendered eatable by the simple ceremony of getting a
piaiman, or even occasionally an old woman \[who may play the rôle of
piai\], to blow a certain number of times on them; apparently on the
principle that the spirit of the animal about to be eaten is thus
expelled" (IT, 368). Schomburgk tells us how the aversion to European
pork was never so strongly met with as among the Wapisianas; at
Watu-ticaba Village the indisposition of a little girl was considered
due to the circumstance that his cook, who had helped the child carry
wood and water, had given her some to eat (ScR, <span
class="small">II</span>, 389). In Cayenne, they do not eat fowls
(*poules*) and other birds though they be delicious; they imagine that
out of spite these animals would cut their stomachs to pieces, gnaw
their intestines, and cause frightful colic with the beak and spurs,
although only the meat portion should be eaten (PBa, 231). The
bush-negroes at Apikollos Village (Surinam) said that all the Trios
Indians would die because the Europeans had partaken of the same food as
they had (Go, 22). All the old piais that I have met still persist in
their refusal to partake of European food ([Sect.
*286*](aflg17.htm#pp_286)).

   <span id="pp_248"></span>**248.**[\*](#pp_248) Food may be restricted
or taboo only under special circumstances, as at an eclipse of the moon
([Sect. *200*](aflg13.htm#pp_200)). In Cayenne, apparently men and women
religiously abstain during the period of mourning from eating certain
meats, or from cutting large timber, and several other practices of this
nature (PBa, 229). The whole family may be restricted in the way of
food, when a member of it happens to be ill ([Sect.
*317*](aflg17.htm#pp_317)). The taboos of various foods at the
physiological periods of a man's or a woman's life are noted elsewhere (

Sects. *267-284*). Among the Makusis, during the time that the natural
colors of the feathers are being artificially altered the owner of the
bird eats very sparingly and chiefly of certain kinds of food (Ti, 1882,
p. 28). The Island Caribs eat flesh only when there are strangers at
table; otherwise, they hunt but for lizards and fish: it is only on
those special occasions when they want to entertain their European
friends or for purposes of trade and barter, that they hunt anything
else (RoP, 506). "When they have to cross over sea to go to another
island like St. Alousi, or St. Vincent, they eat no crabs or lizards,
because these animals live in holes: consequently this would prevent
them getting to another land" (BBR, 245). An Indian does not eat an
animal that he may have domesticated and tamed.

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

   <span id="pp_249"></span>**249.**[\*](#pp_249) Unlike what might have
been expected from a consideration of other savage races, even so near
as those of North America, there seems to be no record of the taboo of
the so-called totem-animal, but I can not assume for this reason that
such taboo is, or was, non-existent. As a matter of fact, during the
whole course of my annotation of all available literature relative to
the Guiana Indians, I can find but one statement bearing on the question
and that in the negative. This is from Crévaux (523). On the Guaviar, a
branch of the Orinoco, he found an Indian who, although a Piapoco (i. e.
Toucan), had no qualms about killing the bird after which his tribe was
named. All the other references are of doubtful totemic significance.

   <span id="pp_250"></span>**250.**[\*](#pp_250) Certain indigenous
animals are not to be eaten, apparently for no assignable cause. On the
Moruca, the Arawaks do not use the flesh of the *Palamedea cornuta*
Linn., although they employ the tail feathers for arrow-barbs (ScR,
<span class="small">II</span>, 457). While the Makusis touch the flesh
of the ant-bear only when forced by want, the Caribs regard it as the
greatest delicacy (ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 434). So also the
Uaupes Indians do not eat the large wild pig (*Dicotyles labiatus*), the
anta (*Tapirus americanus*), or the white-rumped mutun (*Crax globicera*
?) (ARW, 337). In the Pomeroon when men kill a bush-hog or any other
animal that happens to contain young, there are always to be found
Indians who will not touch the flesh. Other animals will be avoided for
more or less defined reasons. Thus, the savannah pewit (*Vanellas
cayennensis*) is never eaten by Indians, as they say that partaking of
its flesh produces deafness (Bro, 104). At Carichana, near River Meta,
Orinoco, the Piaroas said that the people of their tribe infallibly die
when they eat of the manati (AVH, <span class="small">II</span>, 492).
In Surinam, an old Trio informed de Goeje that he would never eat the
head of a quatta monkey, because his mother had told him that he would
get gray hair like it, and women consider gray hair hateful (Go, 22).
Though hog and turtle were abundant on the islands, the Caribs there eat
neither, for the assigned reasons that their eyes might become small
like the former animal, that they might participate in the clumsiness
and stupidity of the latter (RoP, 465). The attributes of the animal
eaten could be transferred by ingestion not only to the person eating
\[compare ingestion of human flesh to obtain attributes of the deceased,
in [Sect. *77*](aflg05.htm#pp_77)\], but even to the child of such
person ([Sect. *279*](aflg16.htm#pp_279)). The Zaparo Indians of the
Napo River (upper Amazon) are "very particular in their diet: unless
from necessity, they will, in most cases, not eat any heavy meats such
as tapir and peccary, but confine themselves to birds, monkeys, deer,
fish, etc., principally because they argue that the heavier meats make
them also unwieldy, like the animals who supply the flesh, impeding
their agility and unfitting them for the chase" (AS, 168). On the upper
Amazon the <span id="page_298">p. 298</span> flesh of the male turtle
(much less numerous than the female) is considered unwholesome,
especially to sick people having external signs of inflammation (HWB,
309).

   <span id="pp_251"></span>**251.**[\*](#pp_251) Dogs also are
precluded from eating certain foods. In Cayenne Crévaux noticed that his
Roucouyenne cooks threw the beaks of the kinoros birds (*Ara canga*)
into the river, in the belief that were their dogs to eat them, they
(the dogs) would be poisoned (Cr, 284). Here, on the Pomeroon, in many
an Indian house you will often find stuck under the eaves of the
overhanging troolie roof or slung up in a basket, the wings and
breast-bones of certain birds and often the bones of a labba or an
acouri. It was a long time before I learned that they were placed there
for a purpose other than ornament or decoration. If a dog were to eat
either of those particular bird bones or any bones whatever of a labba
or an acouri that it had not itself hunted, such dog would never catch
any of these animals again.<span
id="page_298_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_298_note_1)

   <span id="pp_252"></span>**252.**[\*](#pp_252) The temporary
occlusion of vision, as with tobacco and peppers, on the occasion of
visiting, for the first time any strikingly peculiar landmark of natural
scenery, especially in the way of mountains, or even on entering a new
region, would seem to have been a custom very prevalent among the
Indians. From the examples which I propose here submitting it will be
seen that the procedure specially concerns the particular Spirit with
which such landmark or region is connected. Its object, partly perhaps
to placate this Spirit, and so turn aside the sickness or any other evil
it might otherwise choose to send, is mainly to prevent the visiting
individual attracting it toward himself. The procedure is protective or
defensive in the sense of thwarting evil. On first gaining sight of the
Arissaro Hills, Essequibo River, the Caribee Indians, who had never
ascended the river so far, had to undergo an initiatory sight, which
consisted in squeezing tobacco juice into their eyes (ScG, 229). So
again, at the Twasinkie or Coomootie Mountains, much superstition, as
usual, was attached to them, and those who had never seen them before
were obliged to drink lime juice, and to have tobacco water squeezed
into their eyes to avert the Evil Spirit (ScG, 231). Im Thurn (368)
speaks of peppers (Capsicum) being employed for a similar purpose, and
says: "Once, when neither peppers nor limes were at hand, a piece of
blue indigo-dyed cloth was carefully soaked and the dye was then rubbed
into the eyes." While on the Cuywini, writes Barrington Brown: "We
passed a place one afternoon where the river was studded with high
granite rocks two of which rose ten feet or so above the level of the
highest floods. . . . Our guide, Edward . . . turned his head away and
would not look at them: Eruma, one of <span id="page_299">p. 299</span>
our Caribs, took some tobacco, and dipping it into the water, leaned
back and squeezed the juice into his eyes, and as soon as the tears thus
produced had subsided, he calmly gazed upon the rocks" (Bro, 30). Near
the mouth of the Cuywini River, upper Essequibo, to quote the same
author, "were some large granite rocks in passing which our Carib . . .
turned away his face in an opposite direction. Upon questioning him as
to his reason for so doing, I learned that if he looked at them, he
would get fever" (Bro, 244). Another interesting extract is from Jenman
(23):

>    We met on the Savannah about a hundred Indians of all ages and both
> sexes, resting on their way down to the hill to the landing at Tukeit,
> going down to the Mission. It was the first time they had passed the
> "Kaietuk" (Kaieteur) as they called it, though they were careful to
> keep almost beyond the sound of its roar and far out of sight of it.
> Each one, from the newly-born baby in arms, to the oldest man and

> applied by one man, a middle-aged person.

   The present-day Arawaks when visiting any new place for the first
time, whether now connected with Spirits or not, put creek water or
river water into their eyes: they tell me here that it is with the
object of placating any spirits that *may* be lurking in the vicinity,
for should they neglect the custom, the Yawahus *might* not only send
them sore eyes, but many other sicknesses. One woman maintained that,
independently of any evil spirits, the very novelty of the scene might
give her sore eyes, in the absence of the usual precaution.

   <span id="pp_253"></span>**253.**[\*](#pp_253) Warraus assure me that
on looking at a mountain for the first time the eyes are shut to prevent
the person attracting or drawing the Shadow of the Spirit toward him
([Sect. *190*](aflg12.htm#pp_190)). When one person looks at another,
the former draws or drags the latter's shadow ([Sect.
*68*](aflg05.htm#pp_68)) toward him, a principle on which these Indians
explain the taking of a photograph. The Island Carib corpse is laid out
with two weights on the eyes, that he may not see his parents thus
making them ill ([Sect. *80*](aflg05.htm#pp_80)). Catlin gives an
amusing instance among the Conibos of the Amazon, of the local
medicine-man preventing him painting any more portraits by exhorting the
tribesmen as follows: "These things are a great mystery, but there you
are, my friends, with your eyes open all night—they never shut: this is
all wrong and you are very foolish to allow it. You never will be happy
afterwards if you allow these things to be always awake in the night. My
friends, this is only a cunning way this man has to get your skins; and
the next thing they will have glass eyes, and be placed among the skins
of the wild beasts and birds and snakes." (The medicine-man <span
id="page_300">p. 300</span> had been to Para or some other place where
he had seen the stuffed skins in a museum.) (GC, 321-323). For a
pregnant woman to look at the face of a corpse will draw trouble on her
unborn child ([Sect. *279*](aflg16.htm#pp_279)). It is possible that,
perhaps on principles analogous to some of the preceding, most European
races have adopted the practice of closing the eyes when in the attitude
of prayer; it is therefore not so very remarkable that I found the
aboriginal communicants of a certain Mission speaking of prayer
generally by a term which, literally translated, means "to shut the
eyes."

   <span id="pp_254"></span>**254.**[\*](#pp_254) But this temporary
occlusion of the eyes may be accompanied with another procedure, that of
whipping. Thus, at the Cara-utta Rocks, head of Wenamu River, a branch
of the Cuyuni, "the Indians who had never been here before, gave
themselves up to the wildest orgies. Several calabashes were placed on
the rocks, before which two old Arekunas, with faces turned toward the
north, squatted, and murmured unintelligible words, while an equally old
piai rubbed powdered capsicum into the eyes of each of the novices. When
the first pains were over, they broke twigs off from the nearest bushes,
and whipped one another on the legs and feet, until blood was drawn"
(ScR, <span class="small">II</span>, 346). In the last group of cases,
it is not the body, but the rock or other natural feature that is
whipped. And so it happens that while Boddam-Whetham admits that they
will never point at certain rocks with a finger, although one's
attention may be drawn to them by an inclination of the head, other
rocks "they beat with green boughs" (BW, 182); that along the slopes of
the Seroun Mountains, Mazaruni River, under some of the enormous masses
of conglomerate rock, were flowers and green branches that had been
offered to the Rock Spirits by the superstitious natives (BW, 190). But
as this author may have obtained his information concerning the very
same place (Seroun River valley) from Brown's work, published a couple
of years before, I quote from the latter as well: "On the way we passed
a very large isolated rock of diorite which had formed part of one of
the great layers of this rock, horizontally bedded in the sandstone,
upon which were lying the bruised remains of a small tree branch with
many more around its base. These were offerings left by Indian travelers
at the shrine of the spirit of this rock, who believe that if they did
not perform the rite of breaking off a green bough and beating it on the
rock, evil would assuredly befall them" (Br, 78).

   <span id="pp_255"></span>**255.**[\*](#pp_255) In a sense analogous
to the idea of thwarting or avoiding evil may probably be regarded the
closing of the eyes as a sign of "envy, hatred, and malice." Thus, among
Warraus and Arawaks, as between man with man or woman with woman, the
angered one will look at the other, suddenly shut the eyes, keep them
closed a few seconds, and then turn away. The person thus treated will
know that he or she must be prepared for the coming storm. So also the
following <span id="page_301">p. 301</span> occurrence reported frem the
Parou River in Cayenne may find place here: "In a retired spot, I
surprise a little girl who, like the ostrich, hides her face in a hole,
leaving her body entirely exposed" (Cr, 273). It is possible that the
peppering of the witch's eyes before clubbing her was intended to
prevent the poor wretch attracting toward herself the Spirits of those
people she might otherwise have looked at ([Sect.
*319*](aflg17.htm#pp_319)). Compare also the binding of the girl's eyes
in the puberty ceremony ([Sect. *271*](aflg16.htm#pp_271)).

   <span id="pp_256"></span>**256.**[\*](#pp_256) The closing of the
eyes and the concurrent expression of a wish I am unable to obtain
explanations for, except on the hypothesis of some Spirit being
supplicated, and deal with the practice here only as a matter of
convenience. Mention is made of the custom in the Carib story of—

   The Makusis also would seem to have had similar ideas about wishing,
for in their legend of Pia and Makunaima the former tells his mother
that whatever of good she desired she would obtain if she would bow her
head and cover her face with her hands while she expressed her wish
([Sect. *41*](aflg02.htm#pp_41)).

   <span id="pp_257"></span>**257.**[\*](#pp_257) It was a superstition
of the Indians in Cayenne that the first person to see the dancers
arrive at the actual place of entertainment <span id="page_302">p.
302</span> would die during the course of the year or meet with other
misfortune. Hence, directly the dancers left the public meeting-house
(*karbet*) to go to a retired spot for the purpose of decorating
themselves, the audience took good care to go into hiding, and to return
in a body, shouting and screaming like madmen, when the performers put
in their appearance (PBa, 201; LAP, <span class="small">II</span>, 242).

   <span id="pp_258"></span>**258.**[\*](#pp_258) The following are
examples of what might be called restrictions in arts, crafts, and
manufactures.

   On the left bank of the mouth of the Cuyuni is a small hill whither
Indians come from long distances to obtain clay, which is believed to be
especially desirable. Schomburgk tells of a certain superstition which
accounts for such large numbers of people congregating there. The
Indians believe, for instance, that only during the first night of the
incoming full moon ([Sect. *199*](aflg13.htm#pp_199)) dare they carry on
their business. Hence, numbers of people congregate at these times, as
Bernau vouches for, and at break of day start for home laden with a
large quantity. The Indians cling fast to the superstition that if the
clay is obtained at any other times, the vessels acquire an evil
peculiarity not only for becoming speedily broken, but also for bringing
numerous diseases to him who eats out of them.

   <span id="pp_259"></span>**259.**[\*](#pp_259) Such vessels could be
even more intimately associated with Spirit life, as witness the
following story of—

   <span id="pp_260"></span>**260.**[\*](#pp_260) Among the Island
Caribs, when the women make hammocks they place at each end a small
parcel of ashes. Unless this ceremony were observed the hammock would
not last. Should they eat figs when in possession of a new hammock, they
think it would become rotten. They take great care also not to eat of
certain fish with sharp teeth; for this would cause the hammock to be
soon torn. The men erect the houses, except the roofs, which are made by
the women, and canoes (BBR, 242). With the same people, during the
course of manufacture of a canoe, while being burnt out, sticks are
placed across, so as to enlarge it. If a woman did but touch it with her
fingers, they believe it would split (BBR, 243). Father Gumilla, the
missionary of the Orinoco, evidently commiserating the unhappy lot of
the weaker sex, and recognizing the hardships to which they were exposed
in carrying on their field work, made the attempt to get the men to lend
assistance. His exhortation with its fruitless results is given here in
his own words: "Brethren," said I to them, "why don't you help your poor
women to plant? They are tired with the heat, working with their babies
at the breast. Don't you see that it is making both them and your
children sick?" "Father," they replied, "you don't understand these
things, which accordingly worry you. You have yet to learn that women
know how to bring forth, and we don't: if they plant, the maize stalk
gives two or three ears of corn, the cassava bush yields two or three
basketsful of roots, and similarly everything is multiplied" (G, <span
class="small">II</span>, 237).

   <span id="pp_261"></span>**261.**[\*](#pp_261) A woman must preserve
her fan for the uses for which it is intended, namely, for blowing up
the fire; should she use it on herself, she would become thin—at least
this is what the Pomeroon Arawaks tell me.

   Among the nations bordering on the Amazon the Indians are entirely
nude. They regard it as an almost certain sign that he who would cover
what shame obliges civilized man to hide would soon be unfortunate, or
would die in the course of the year (PBa, 121-2). It might be pardonable
perhaps to mention here the reproof which the Island Caribs gave their
European visitors when the latter, regarding them too closely, laughed
at their nudity: "Friends! You should look only at our faces!" (RoP,
461.)

   <span id="pp_262"></span>**262.**[\*](#pp_262) Waterton has recorded
the following beliefs in connection with the manufacture of curare
(wurali) poison:

>    The women and young girls are not allowed to be present. The shed
> under which it has been boiled is pronounced polluted and abandoned
> ever after. He who makes the poison must eat nothing that morning and
> must continue fasting as long as the <span id="page_304">p. 304</span>
> operation lasts. The pot in which it is boiled must be a new one, and
> must never have held anything before, otherwise the poison would be
> deficient in strength; add to this that the operator must take
> particular care not to expose himself to the vapor which arises from
> it while on the fire. . . . Still the Indians think that it affects
> the health; and the operator either is, or what is more probable,
> supposes himself to be sick, for some days later . . . and it would
> seem that they imagine it affects others as well as him who boils it;
> for an Indian agreed one evening to make some for me, but the next
> morning he declined having anything to do with it, alleging that his
> wife was with child! \[W, 93-4.\]

Schomburgk more or less confirms these restrictions when he says that
before and during the making of the poison the operator must submit to a
strict fast, and that during the cooking, no woman, especially a
pregnant woman, or maid may come near the house; furthermore his own
wife must not be pregnant. In the particular instance cited the
distinguished traveler was asked not to eat sugar-cane or sugar during
the manufacture of the poison (Sc, R<span class="small">I</span>,
455-7). "Thus the greater the abstention from food on the part of the
peai men, the greater the virulence of the urali, its action being
supposed to be deadly in correspondence with the degree of hunger of the
maker" (J. J. Quelch, Ti, 1895, p. 262). Im Thurn supplies the following
"Water was fetched especially for the poison-making from a stream nearly
a quarter of a mile distant; and care was taken in carrying this to the
house, to rest it on the ground every few yards. For, say the Indians, a
bird wounded by a poisoned dart will fly only as far as the water, with
which the poison was made, was carried without rest" (IT, 311).

   <span id="pp_263"></span>**263.**[\*](#pp_263) There would appear to
be some intimate relationship between an individual and his personal
name (cf. Sects. [*124*](aflg08.htm#pp_124),
[*125*](aflg08.htm#pp_125)), of such nature that the very mention of it
in his presence would be fraught with serious consequences; neither, as
in the case of spirits ([Sect. *172*](aflg11.htm#pp_172)), may he be
pointed at, or trodden over ([Sect. *220*](aflg14.htm#pp_220)). The name
is deemed to be part and parcel of the individual, and the mention of it
under those circumstances would put him in the power, as it were, of the
person speaking. This rule held good for both Mainland (KG, <span
class="small">I</span>, 184; <span class="small">II</span>, 147) and
Island Indians. According to age and sex, one will address another as
brother, sister, father, mother, son or daughter, etc., or will speak of
him or her as the father or mother, etc., of such an one; or, to
specialize, "they will speak half the name, e. g. Mala instead of saying
Mala-kaali, and Hiba for Hiba-lomon" (RoP, 451; KG, <span
class="small">II</span>, 147). This fact will thus render the following
statements of de Goeje and Kirke more intelligible: "Some Trios have two
names, one reserved for friends, the other for strangers: Crévaux says
that the Ojanas might have two names, one for addressing the person and
the other for referring to him when absent" (Go, 26). "It is a curious
thing that you can never discover an Indian's real name . . . he never
divulges it, nor is he ever called <span id="page_305">p. 305</span> by
it. He is always known by some nickname or name of distinction for his
prowess in war, hunting, or fishing" (Ki, 120). So also when dead, the
name of the deceased must not be mentioned.

   <span id="pp_264"></span>**264.**[\*](#pp_264) Among the Pomeroon
Arawaks the mother always gives the name first to her child,
independently of the piai, who bestows one subsequently. It is said that
friends, brothers, and sisters may call them by these names, which stick
to them throughout life, but it should be borne in mind that these
Arawaks have been in closer contact with Europeans than any of the other
tribes. The following are some of the names given by the mother at
birth:

   The name bestowed subsequently in this tribe by the piai takes place
about the period when the child begins to creep; he asks the Spirit in
the maraka (rattle) to give the name. "An offering of considerable value
is necessary on this occasion, as, according to the fee given to
propitiate the pe-i-man, is the virtue of the incantations pronounced:
an unnamed Indian is thought to be the certain victim of the first
sickness or misfortune that he may encounter: accordingly, only the very
poorest of them are without names" (HiC, 229). At the present time, it
would seem that the piai gives a name only if he has been called in to
attend a child when sick; under such circumstances he will say that he
has dreamed that the child requires a name, and the parents accordingly
ask him to give one. Such names are given with regard to the personal
appearance, to birds or other animals, to tobacco (e. g. Yuri-niro,
Yuri-tukoro = tobacco flower), after the piai's kickshaws, etc. (e. g.
Shibari, "stone," Kalliko-yang, "crystal," Wara-maraka, a name derived
from his rattle), or "after some quality or title." With the Makusis it
was either the grandmother or grandfather, who, on the conclusion of the
couvade, gave the infant one of the names customary in the family (ScR,
<span class="small">II</span>, 315). Among the Tukanos it is the father,
under similar circumstances, who gives the name, generally that of an
animal (KG, <span class="small">I</span>, 313). So also on the Islands
the Caribs do not bestow names immediately after birth, but wait for
twelve or fifteen days when they call in a man and woman who take the
place of sponsors, and pierce the child's under-lip and nostril. The
majority of the names which the Caribs impose on their children are
taken from their ancestors or from various trees which grow on the
islands, or from something that has happened to the father at the time
of his wife's pregnancy, or during her lying-in (RoP, 552-3). A
convalescent patient may start life afresh with a new name ([Sect.
*305*](aflg17.htm#pp_305)).

   <span id="pp_265"></span>**265.**[\*](#pp_265) The circumstances vary
under which the name already given may be changed. As already mentioned
([Sect. *264*](aflg15.htm#pp_264)), this was the case with the Arawaks
on recovery from prolonged sickness. On the Carib Islands the names
given to the male children shortly after birth were not retained
throughout life; they changed them when old enough to be received into
the rank of warriors, or if they had borne themselves bravely in battle
and had killed an Arawak chief, they took his name as a mark of honor
(RoP, 552-3). Both on the Islands and on the Mainland names were
exchanged in testimony of great affection and inviolable friendship
(RoP, 513): "When they want to make friends, they ask for our names and
give us theirs. To show affection and friendship they want us to
exchange names" (BBR, 237-8). In Porto Rico "Juan Ponce de Leon, in
fact, was received into the bosom of the family, and the Cacique
exchanged names with him, which is the Indian pledge of perpetual amity"
<span id="page_307">p. 307</span> (WI, 778). With the present-day
Arawaks and Warraus, among members of the same sex it is of common
occurrence as proof of friendship and affection not to exchange names,
but for the younger to adopt the name of the older one ([Sect.
*120*](aflg08.htm#pp_120)). The Island Caribs have also in their
drinking bouts or on occasions of public rejoicing, some one appointed
to give them a new name, whom they address after having drunk well. "I
wish to be named. Name me!" one will say, whereupon the other
immediately satisfies him and is rewarded with a present—a
quartz-crystal, or other article (RoP, 552-3).

   <span id="pp_266"></span>**266.**[\*](#pp_266) With a view to their
becoming good hunting dogs, the Warraus name their canine friends after
those animals which are known to hunt well, as certain ants and bees
which catch plenty of other prey; after warribisi ([Sect.
*88*](aflg06.htm#pp_88)), a big wasp that lays its eggs in the ground
and brings various worms from the bush for its young, when hatched, to
feed on; after sakaro and buruma, two crabs which run quickly and hunt
well; after the giant anteater, the shark, and the small wild dog
(karisiri), all of these possessing undoubtedly good hunting qualities.

   <span id="pp_266A"></span>**266A.**[\*](#pp_266A) Special words, or
paraphrases, have to be used under particular circumstances; thus, in
traveling over water—river or sea—the use of certain names otherwise
employed in ordinary every-day conversation, is absolutely forbidden
([Sect. *194*](aflg12.htm#pp_194)). On the Aiary River (Rio Negro) the
villages have secret names which are not mentioned except under pressure
(KG, <span class="small">I</span>, 184). There are some few words which
may be employed only according to the sex speaking, or spoken to. Thus,
among the Arawaks, to express the word "surely" or "certainly" a man
will say *tashi* to a woman, but *tade* to a man, whereas a woman will
use the term *tara* when conversing with one of her own sex, but *tashi*
when talking to one of the opposite. "Oh, yes!" "So you say," is
similarly expressed by three words: *babui* between woman and woman, or
woman and man, but *dadai* when a man addresses a woman, and *daido*
when he is talking to another man. The signification of this distinction
I have not been able to discover; it is not connected, of course, with
the use of different languages by the opposite sexes, as was the case in
the Lesser Antilles with the Carib warriors and their Arawak wives. And,
finally, with the mainland Arawaks a particular plaintive intonation is
used in inquiries after the health or welfare of those who are ill or
unfortunate; and the tone is always suited to the circumstances and
situation of the party addressed (HiC, 248).

<span id="page_292_note_1"></span>[1](#page_292_fr_1) When a Warrau is
very very tired he gives a whistle, something like *ho-ho´-wi!
ho-ho´-wi!* to catch his breath. The Indians say the old people do it
still.

<span id="page_293_note_1"></span>[1](#page_293_fr_1) This idea of
throwing peppers into a fire appears to have been an old trick. It is
stated by Captain Jean-Pierre that, when the old Oyampis, of the upper
Yary, Cayenne, wished to stop an enemy, they surrounded their village
with a circle of fire into which they threw handfuls of dry capsicums.
It is impossible to fight when one is seized with an unconquerable
sneezing (Cr, 271).

<span id="page_294_note_1"></span>[1](#page_294_fr_1) It is only proper
to state that Crévaux gives it as his opinion that the object of these
boucans is to placate (*calmer*) Yolock, the Bush Spirit, who can
prevent them killing game. With this opinion, however, I am unable to
agree, but can only regard these structures as having something to do in
the way of protection from the injuries which one might reasonably
expect the slaughtered monkeys would do their best to inflict.—W. E. R.

away the Bush Spirit, the Yurokon.
