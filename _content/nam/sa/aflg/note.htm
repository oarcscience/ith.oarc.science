<P>All of the stories and many of the direct quotations in this book are presented in a smaller font in the printed edition to set them apart from the author's own commentary. In this electronic edition, those sections have been rendered indented (i.e., inside of &lt;<FONT color="purple">blockquote</FONT>&gt; tags).</P>

<P>There are internal references to other parts of the text throughout, and all of these have been linked to allow for ease of navigation. In addition, every story and numbered section is preceded by a red asterisk link (i.e., <FONT color="red"><U>*</U></FONT>), which is a self-referential anchor. This acts as a temporary bookmark, and by clicking on this anchor before following other links, you will be able to use your browser's back button to return directly to the section that you were reading (and not to the beginning of the file) after following internal links. Citations of William Henry Brett's <A HREF="../lmbg/index">Legends and Myths of the Aboriginal Indians of British Guiana</A> have also been linked, as these books were posted to sacred-texts simultaneously.</P>
