## C<span class="small">HAPTER</span> X THE SPIRITS OF THE BUSH <span class="small">ASSOCIATED WITH PARTICULAR PLANTS</span>

   <span class="small">Derivation of Man from Plants, and vice versa
(*[163](#pp_163)-163A*); Association of Bush Spirits with Silk-cotton
Tree (*[164](#pp_164)*), Cassava (*[165](#pp_165)-166*), Maize
(*[167](#pp_167)*), Kofa (*[168](#pp_168)*), Snake-bush
(*[168A](#pp_168A)*), the Whistling Caladium (Kanaima), Blow-tube Grass
and Dakini Tree (*[168B](#pp_168B)*), Ite and Mora (*[168C](#pp_168C)*),
and possibly with the "Tree of Life," the "Devil-doer," Silverballi,
Darina, Hiari, and Bamboo (*[169](#pp_169)*). The belief in Binas may be
but a development of this association of Bush Spirits with plant-life
(*[170](#pp_170)*).</span>

   <span id="pp_163"></span>**163.**[\*](#pp_163) So far as mankind is
concerned, their original derivation from trees, trunks, and fruits is
accepted by many of the tribes ([Sect. *57*](aflg04.htm#pp_57)). As to
the converse idea—the transformation of human beings, or their Spirits,
into plants ([Sect. *59*](aflg04.htm#pp_59)), I can find only two traces
of it: one, in an Arawak legend relative to the discovery of the whip
used in the *makuari* dance ([Sect. *75*](aflg05.htm#pp_75)), and the
other, in the Yahuna story of the Jurupari ceremony ([Sect.
*163A*](aflg10.htm#pp_163A)).

> Makuari whips.

   <span id="pp_163A"></span>**163A.**[\*](#pp_163A) In the origin of
the Jurupari festival according to the Yahuna Indians of the River
Apaporis there is also a conversioa of a human being into a plant. This
is their story (KG, <span class="small">II</span>, 293):

>    A long time ago, from out of the great Water-house, the house of
> the Sun, came a little boy Milómaki, who sang so beautifully that
> everyone came from far and near to hear him; but when they reached
> their settlements again, all died. Their relatives thereupon came and
> burned him on a large pyre, but he continued singing until he died.
> Thus was his body destroyed, but his spirit went up to heaven. From
> the ashes grew a long green leaf, which visibly became greater and
> greater and turned into the first Paxiuba palm \[*Iriartea
> exorrhiza*\], a timber used for all kinds of weapons and articles. The
> people made big flutes of this tree, which produced the same melodies
> that Milómaki had sung. To honor Milómaki the men dance and blow on
> these flutes nowadays when the various fruits, as Inga, Pupunha
> \[*Guilielma speciosa*\], Castanha, Umari, are ripe, because it was he
> who created them all. The women and children must not see these
> flutes: the former would die, and the latter would eat earth, become
> sick, and die.

   <span id="pp_164"></span>**164.**[\*](#pp_164) Several examples are
to be met with of Bush Spirits being associated with particular plants
or trees. Perhaps the most interesting is that of the silk-cotton tree
(*Bombax* sp.), the superstitions concerning which have been incorrectly
surmised (Br. 369) as communicated from the negroes to the Indians. The
earliest reference in this connection that I have been able thus far to
find for it, in the Guianas, is by Stedman (St, <span
class="small">II</span>, 261), in Surinam: "Perceiving that it was their
\[negroes'\] custom to bring their offerings to the wild cotton-tree . .
. under this tree our gadoman or priest delivers his lectures: and for
this reason our common people have so much veneration for it, that they
will not cut it down on any account whatever." It would be interesting
to learn whether the so-called *fromager* of the French Ivory Coast is
identical with our tree. Certain it is that the records are abundant as
to both Indians and negroes (AR, 45) refusing to cut one down. As a
matter of fact, however, the superstitions of the *Bombax* were
cherished in middle America long before the arrival of the negroes: the
Mayas of Yucatan spoke of it as the Tree of Creation, etc., under whose
shade the spirits of mortals reposed. I know Arawaks who firmly believe
that this tree moves within a circuit at midnight and returns to its
proper place again. Dance (57) states that its guardian spirit "walks
round the tree at mid-day, and at mid-night." Brett (377, 398) informs
us of an Arawak tradition that men and other living creatures were
originally made out of its bark and timber ([Sect.
*57*](aflg04.htm#pp_57)). Women have told me that the Adda-kuyuha, in
the form of a large bird, lives on the buds (i. e. picks out the cotton
to build its nest with); <span id="page_230">p. 230</span> that the
shedding of the leaves is a sign that the Spirit has taken its
departure; and that when the foliage is resumed, the Spirit has
returned. Considering that there are some four or five other deciduous
trees known to the Arawaks, it would not appear that their superstitious
regard for it can be due to the periodic shedding of the leaves. From
the fact of the silk-cotton tree being credited with the power of moving
within a circuit ([Sect. *8*](aflg02.htm#pp_8)), a separate sentient
existence may have been claimed for it; but such a property might
equally be due to the particular medicine-man or Bush Spirit ([Sect.
*167*](aflg10.htm#pp_167)) happening to occupy its trunk or branches.

   <span id="pp_165"></span>**165.**[\*](#pp_165) The cassava plant
affords a very good illustration where the associated Spirit remains
distinct, and is given a separate existence, so much so that it may be
attacked by evil Spirits to prevent it distributing its favors, or may
be thanked and honored for the benefits bestowed by it upon mankind. The
Arawaks, even at the present time in the Pomeroon District, with the
building of a house, or rather at its completion, give a party: when all
the guests are arrived, some of the cassiri, before its distribution
among the guests, is thrown by the house-mistress on the uprights; she
also places pieces of cassava at the four corners under the eaves. This
is supposed to feed the Yawahus, or Spirits of the Bush, who, unless
thus treated, would not permit the Spirit of the Cassava to furnish the
next crop. The Warrau Indians of the Moruca River had also a special
festival, or thank-offering to the Cassava Spirit for the bountiful
harvest which it had supplied them with, such festival taking the usual
form of a drinking bout and a dance: they called it the Aru-hoho (lit.
cassava festival).

   <span id="pp_166"></span>**166.**[\*](#pp_166) So also, the first
baking of cassava bread from a new field formerly was attended by
unusual ceremony. "The cassava, which on ordinary occasions is scraped
and washed, at the preparation for the first baking, was scraped but not
washed. . . . The juice extracted from the grated cassava by means of
the matapi (and which otherwise would be boiled into cassirip) is, on
this occasion . . . poured out on the ground as a libation for this, its
first fruits" (Da, 102—at Berbice). This is still done on the Moruca
River, the Arawaks here making the juice from the first cassava
collected off the new field, sprinkling it a few days later here and
there over the center of the field. The Indians say that this is a gift,
a sort of thanks, to the Spirit of the Cassava. On the upper Amazon a
purely Indian festival is celebrated the first week of February, which
is called the Feast of Fruits, several kinds of wild fruit becoming ripe
at that time (HWB, 280): this may have a meaning similar to that
ascribed to the ceremony in connection with the cassava.

   <span id="pp_167"></span>**167.**[\*](#pp_167) Another curious sort
of Spirit, that of "the Rot," is associated with buck-corn (maize). Here
is an account of it:

> picked all the peppers around, gathering twenty basketsful of them.
> They then made a ring of fire right round the komaka tree, which the

   <span id="pp_168"></span>**168.**[\*](#pp_168) Another tree which,
according to Arawak beliefs, has intimate association with the Spirit
world, is the *Clusia grandiflora*, an epiphyte, which throws down
straight aerial roots that finally fix themselves in the ground below.
Indian belief explains this peculiarity by the statement that the bunia
bird roosts on the host, whence it drops its castings ([Sect.
*350*](aflg19.htm#pp_350)), which are nothing more <span
id="page_232">p. 232</span> than the aerial roots in question. The
Arawaks speak of this epiphyte as the kófa.

   <span id="pp_168A"></span>**168A.**[\*](#pp_168A) Space must be found
here also for mention of the Pomeroon Arawak belief in some intimate
relationship between certain plants (known as "snake-bush" to the
creoles) and venomous serpents, the poisonous effects of which they can
avert. A similar idea prevailed among the same tribe on the Demerara
River:

>    The Indians advised that when the snakes (a bush-master and a
> labaria that had been killed and buried) were supposed to be
> decomposed, they should be dug up the bones burned, and carefully
> replaced, and the spot of ground fenced in. From the ground manured
> with the burned bones of the snakes, would grow up, they said,
> snake-bushes that could be used as antidotes to the virulence of
> snake-bites. Some plants called "snake-bush" resemble a group of small
> snakes flattened laterally, standing upright, from twelve to twenty
> inches, with their tails planted in the ground. \[Da, 324.\]

   <span id="pp_168B"></span>**168B.**[\*](#pp_168B) Among the Caribs,
the masiemo (i. e. kanaima), *Caladium*, would seem at first sight to
possess qualities almost distinctive: it is a large-leaf species which I
have seen cultivated at Carib settlement on Manawarin Creek. Its
peculiarity lies in its supposed power of uttering a long low whistle,
and shaking the sleeper's hammock with the object of rousing him from
slumber to a sense of his danger on the near approach of the human and
animal kanaima, or blood-avenger ([Sect. *320*](aflg18.htm#pp_320)). The
plant from which the blow-tube is derived commonly grows in wet places,
as wide stagnant marshes, and superstition has stationed an Evil Spirit
to defend it, whence the Indians have the apprehension that some ill
must befall him who ventures in to procure the reed (Pnk, <span
class="small">I</span>, 488). In especially bad cases of sickness among
the Surinam Caribs the chief remedy is the sap of the Dakini tree: to
obtain this, the piai has to get the permission of the Spirit of the
Tree, and only after many a parleying will he cut an opening to obtain
it (AK, 193).

   <span id="pp_169"></span>**169.**[\*](#pp_169) Among remaining plants
which may, perhaps, be regarded as associated more or less intimately
with Spirits and the like, are the "Tree of Life," the Devil-doer, the
Silverballi, the Darina, the Hiari, the Kanaima ([Sect.
*168B*](aflg10.htm#pp_168B)), and perhaps the Bamboo. A leaf of the
plant of the "Tree of Life" (*Bryophyllum calycinum*), the Kakuhu-adda
of the Arawaks, is sometimes suspended in the house, both on the
Demerara and the Pomeroon, when one of the inmates is ill. Should the
leaf germinate, as is its nature to do under ordinary circumstances, it
is accepted as a sign that the sick man will recover. But if it wither,
that is an indication he will die. The Devil-doer, the uses of which
have apparently been taught by the Indians to the blacks, is a
bush-rope, called by the latter, the Fighting Stick, or Debbil-dooha,
Debra dwar, or Zebra dwar. It is said to have the effect when dried,
pulverized, and smoked with tobacco, of rendering all within the
influence of the smoke pugnacious—and a row is certain: it is used to
stimulate virility, and excite venery (Da, 286). So again, the Indians
are of opinion that the scent of the burning chips of the Silverballi
(*Nectandra pisi*) makes people quarrelsome (ibid.). At a certain
season, the Darina has every appearance of being dead. But having shed
its bark it begins to revive; the new bark becomes red like the
bloodwood and thickens; new leaves spring forth, and the tree resumes
its beauty. At midnight the Arawak Indians hear the chants of the
medicine-man emanating from the tree (ibid.). The Hiari \[Hearih\], a
large tree with thick leaves, which bears a small seed, is probably the
Aiuke of the Akawais. The gum, or the inner bark, scraped, mixed with
water, and given to the sick will cause the Spirit of the tree to appear
to him, and point out the person who inflicted his illness upon him:
thrown into the fire, it stupefies all who inhale its fumes (Da, 285).
The smoke of the wood when burning is fatal to all kinds of animals
(Bol, 258). The Pomeroon Arawaks believe that if the leaves fall into
the river from an overhanging tree, sickness will fall upon the people
farther down the stream. The same folk believe that the Bamboo flowers
and seeds only during the night, which certainly accounts for the
fructification not being seen, if for nothing else: any alleged Indian
superstition concerning this palm must be counteracted of course by the
fact that it is an introduced plant. The ability of the house-posts to
talk ([Sect. *16*](aflg02.htm#pp_16)) may be traces of a Spirit
originally associated with the timber.

   <span id="pp_170"></span>**170.**[\*](#pp_170) I am very strongly
inclined to regard all the (vegetal) attraction-charms, or binas, used
in hunting ([Sect. *233*](aflg14.htm#pp_233)) or love-making <span
id="page_234">p. 234</span> ([Sect. *237*](aflg14.htm#pp_237)), and
otherwise, as survivals of an original belief in plants possessing
associated Spirits; while the presence of the originally associated
Spirit has been lost sight of, and more or less forgotten, its
attributes, properties, and powers have been retained. It will be
remembered that all such binas have an exceptional source of origin—the
calcined bones of a snake ([Sect. *235*](aflg14.htm#pp_235)), and in
this connection it is no less interesting to note that the Haiari root
(*Lonchocarpus* sp.), fish-poison, which can equally be regarded as an
attraction-charm, should also possess animal (with its contained spirit)
relationships, in that it has been quickened in human blood. I here
paraphrase the Legend of the Haiari Root, given by Brett ([BrB,
172](../lmbg/lmbg5b.htm#page_172)):

>    An old fisherman noticed that when his boy accompanied him, and
> swam about in the river, there the fishes would die, and yet were
> quite good to eat. So he made a point of making the lad bathe every
> day. But the fish were determined upon putting an end to this.
> Accordingly one day when the lad, after a swim, was lying basking in
> the sun, those fish which were possessed of spines, and especially the
> sting-ray, sprang quickly up at him and pricked him. The lad died of
> his wounds, but before dying told his father to watch for the strange
> plants that would spring up from the ground in those spots where his
> blood had fallen. The father did so, and found the haiari.
