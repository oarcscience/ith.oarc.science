## C<span class="small">HAPTER</span> IX THE SPIRITS OF THE BUSH <span class="small">ANIMALS AS SENTIENT HUMAN BEINGS</span>

   <span class="small">Preliminary (*[130A](#pp_130A)*). Fables, Tales,
and Legends (*[131](#pp_131)-162D*).</span>

   <span id="pp_130A"></span>**130A.**[\*](#pp_130A) It is proposed to
devote this chapter to a collection of legends dealing with the many
beasts and birds met with in the forest, interesting in that they are
all represented as thinking, talking, and acting as do sentient human
beings. They are also believed to possess Spirits just like those of
human folk. At the same time we must not be surprised to learn that the
events and occurrences now about to be recorded are supposed to have
taken place a long while ago; but in those days, so the Akawais say,
Makunaima made man and animal all of one speech, advising them to live
in unity, and judging by the legends here narrated the injunction seems
to have been fairly well obeyed. To put the matter shortly, these
creatures with human ideas were born so: they "growed." True it is that
now and again the fact of the human actor having an animal form, or the
animal an anthropomorphic one, is explained as being due to reasons
already stated, i. e., by way of punishment or pure devilment at the
instigation of the Spirit of some person departed. It is also a firm
article of faith that the medicine-man, to whom nothing is impossible,
can effect transformation of himself or others, similar to those
produced by the Spirits. In addition, there is a widespread Indian
belief that at every eclipse of the moon animals are metamorphosed—a
tapir may change into a snake, a man into a beast, and vice versa. And
so even in the telling of these stories, the Indian expects his hearers
to take quite as a matter of course—just in the same way as he is firmly
convinced himself—that animals and birds associate with man; that they
are all of one and the same breed; that they may equally live, eat, and
drink, love, hate, and die. It is small wonder then that the Indian
folk-lore is so largely crammed with this same idea of Man and Animal
(used in its widest sense) being so intimately interchangeable.

> the girl to tell her father go fetch in the game which he had
> killed.<span id="page_200_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_200_note_2) The

> id="page_201_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_201_note_1) But in spite of his

> bark\] apron-belt was nowhere to be seen; not long afterward the
> buck-pots began to disappear one after the other; and so things
> continued unaccountably to be lost. Though the parents had not the
> slightest idea that such was the case, it was the Tiger who came every
> now and then after nightfall to steal all these things for the little
> girl to use. She was getting of course to be a young maiden now, and
> Tiger was minding her as his own kith and kin. The young maiden soon
> became a woman, nourished with all the meat that Tiger provided.
> \[Quandocumque menstruavit sanguinem lambavit.\] He was still a tiger
> and, continuing to do what tigers and dogs do \[incepit femmam
> olfacere\]. Moreover, his two brothers, being similarly affected,
> followed his example. The girl felt very strange at these periods and
> could not understand the actions toward her of Tiger and his two
> brothers. So she made up her mind to escape, and asked Tiger one day
> how far their place was from the spot where her parents lived. He was
> somewhat suspicious and wanted to know first of all why she asked the

> will die soon. I am young. What will then happen to me? If I knew
> where they were, I could then go to my parents." Recognizing the force
> of her argument, he told her that they lived in such and such a
> direction, that it was not far, and that immediately upon his decease
> she must hurry to them, lest his two brothers should meet her and tear
> her up. Contented for the present with this information, the woman
> bided her time to seize a favorable opportunity of escape—an
> opportunity which was not long in coming. She planned what to do, she
> was getting tired of always being alone <span id="page_203">p.
> 203</span> in the depths of the forest. So, taking the biggest of the

> "No! it is too heavy. I want you to help me." So without more ado,
> Tiger stooped down, put his paws one on each side of the projecting
> rim of the pot, and so lifted it off the fire. While thus occupied,
> she smartly tapped the pot from below up, dashing the boiling contents
> over the creature's face, a procedure which made him fall, yell with

> bush, and returned in about two hours with some meat for her. "Cook
> this," he told her, "before your brothers come back: as usual they
> will return with nothing." Adaba spoke truly, for soon after the three
> brothers came back empty-handed. You can imagine their surprise when

> would like to see the arrows they were using. When they showed him
> these, he burst into a hearty laugh, and pointing to the fungus that
> was growing everywhere on them, said that so long as they did not
> remove this stuff their arrows would never shoot straight \[[Sect.
> *144*](aflg09.htm#pp_144)\]. He also cleaned their arrows for them.
> Adaba then told their sister to spin a fishing-line which, when
> completed, he tied between two trees. He next told the brothers to
> take aim at the fishing-line, with the cleaned arrows, and shoot. They
> did so, and each brother's arrow stuck into the very center of the
> fishing line. Adaba also had a curious trick in shooting with his
> arrow, because instead of taking aim at an animal direct, he would
> point the arrow up into the sky, so that in its descent it would stick
> into the creature's back. The brothers began to learn this method, and
> soon became such adepts at it that they never missed anything. Indeed
> the brothers became so proud of themselves and of Adaba that they took
> him home with them, and made him their brother-in-law. And Adaba lived
> a long, long time very happily with their sister. But one day, the
> woman said to him, "Husband, let us go and have a bath in the pond."
> They went away together, and when they reached there, the wife got in
> first and called upon Adaba to come in also. But he said: "No, I never
> bathe in places like this, in ponds. My bathing-place is in the
> water-holes inside the hollow trees." So she dashed some of the water
> over him, and after doing so three times, she jumped out of the pond
> and rushed to seize him, but directly she put her hands on him, he
> turned himself into a frog again, and hopped away into the hollow

> why he had gone away, and so they beat their sister unmercifully.
> This, however, did not mend matters, because Adaba never came out of

   <span id="pp_151"></span>**151.**[\*](#pp_151) Among the Arawaks
tradition has it that the old stone axes, or *wakili-na-baro* (lit.
ancients-their-ax), came from a far distant country, from a place so far
away that it took years for those who went in search of them to get back
home again. Many a bizarre exploit is told in connection with the search
for these stone implements, in the same way that many a superstition is
attached to the weapon itself among several nations, both civilized and
savage, elsewhere. The very length of the supposititious journey to be
accomplished has given opportunity for fictions to be introduced with
regard to the rivers and seas that had to be crossed, and the animal and
plant life met with on the way. But beyond all the exaggeration
consequent on the well-known desire of the foreign-traveled narrator to
tell his stay-at-home friends so much more than his real experiences,
and after making allowances for all the personal additions and
embellishments that, in the absence of any written records, must
necessarily and pardonably have crept into the telling of the story from
one to another—there still flows through most of these extraordinary
adventures a sort of ethical undercurrent conveying the lesson that
disobedience to one's elders never remains unpunished. At the same time,
I am not prepared to say whether the introduction of this ethical
element is purposeful or accidental on the part of the old people, who
usually relate these legends. The following exploits and occurrences, as
well as others which I can not detail here, are all comprised in a story
which I propose naming—

<span id="footnotes_page_200">p. 200</span>

<span id="page_200_note_1"></span>[1](#page_200_fr_1) This *ahawara* is
the Warrau term for race, nation, tribe, etc.; thus *Arawak-u ahawara*
signifies the Arawak nation.

<span id="page_200_note_2"></span>[2](#page_200_fr_2) Three Indian
customs are involved in this action: (*a*) The wife was tabooed from
touching the meat, owing to her physiological condition ([Sect.
*274*](aflg16.htm#pp_274)). (*b*) Her newly-acquired husband must not
bring it into the house, otherwise he would lose his luck in hunting
that particular animal ([Sect. *244*](aflg15.htm#pp_244)). (*c*) A man
and his father-in-law, though they may converse in a friendly enough
manner on everyday general topics, must never give each other any orders
or instructions except through the medium of the wife, she being the
go-between, so to speak.

<span id="footnotes_page_201">p. 201</span>

<span id="page_201_note_1"></span>[1](#page_201_fr_1) Quite recently a
woman complained about having been turned off a certain mission-station,
for the sole reason discoverable by me that she wanted to live with her
deceased sister's husband. On the other hand, when the missionary joins
certain cousins in wedlock, the old Indians regard this as bestial and
incestuous: it is a matter of blood-relationship.—W. E. R.

<span id="page_201_note_2"></span>[2](#page_201_fr_2) During the
promiscuous bathing indulged in by the untutored Indians, the fact of a
woman doing this to a member of the opposite sex is tantamount to
solicitation.

<span id="page_201_note_3"></span>[3](#page_201_fr_3) The idea intended
to be conveyed here is that just in the same way that water mixed with
honey weakens and spoils it, so fire melts and destroys the wax. As
already mentioned, Simo belonged to the great Bee Nation, whose members
are not made of flesh and bone, but of honey and wax.

<span id="footnotes_page_203">p. 203</span>

<span id="page_203_note_1"></span>[1](#page_203_fr_1) The grindstone
referred to here is a large chunk of sandstone, which is brought into
the Pomeroon District from the Waini by way or trade and barter.

<span id="page_203_note_2"></span>[2](#page_203_fr_2) When, through the
interpreter, I pointed out to the old woman who told me the story that
the ending was somewhat unsatisfactory, she reminded me that when
Tiger's two brothers came to the house, they found only the corpse
there. Hence there was no one left to tell her what actually did
transpire subsequently.—W .E. R.

<span id="footnotes_page_204">p. 204</span>

<span id="page_204_note_1"></span>[1](#page_204_fr_1) I happen to know a
woman who has a child with a flexed, deformed hand, with regard to which
scandal gives the explanation on somewhat the above lines. The mother,
however, accounts for the deformity in a certainly more rational way by
the statement that, during her pregnancy, she was frightened one day on
suddenly coming across a sloth lying in the foot-path.—W. E. R.

<span id="footnotes_page_205">p. 205</span>

<span id="page_205_note_1"></span>[1](#page_205_fr_1) I am afraid my
readers will be weary *ad nauseam* of the reptition, in these legends,
of cases in which the tongue gets loosened under the influence of drink.
When, however, one realizes that these bacchanalian orgies constitute an
integral part of the Indian social life, it will be no matter for
surprise that the old adage, *In vino veritas*, so often finds
application here.—W. E. R.

<span id="page_205_note_2"></span>[2](#page_205_fr_2) Among all these
Indians the making of the babracote is woman's work.

<span id="page_205_note_3"></span>[3](#page_205_fr_3) For another Warrau
version of this story see [Sect. *300*](aflg17.htm#pp_300).

<span id="footnotes_page_206">p. 206</span>

<span id="page_206_note_1"></span>[1](#page_206_fr_1) This part of the
story will be understood by remembering thst in this *Maurtita* palm the
bunches of fruit form around the top of the trunk a more or less
circular obstacle to anything passing to the foliage above.

<span id="page_206_note_2"></span>[2](#page_206_fr_2) This story bears
somewhat close comparison with those given in [Sects.
*142*](aflg09.htm#pp_142) and [*303*](aflg17.htm#pp_303).

<span id="footnotes_page_207">p. 207</span>

<span id="page_207_note_1"></span>[1](#page_207_fr_1) These birds have a
feather-coloring somewhat as here mentioned.

<span id="page_207_note_2"></span>[2](#page_207_fr_2) I have failed thus
far to learn the use or meaning of these obsolete ornaments, if
ornaments indeed they were: on the other hand, there is the possibility
of them having been the dummy-figures of enemies slain in battle, as we
know, from historical evidence, it was the custom in old-time Carib
houses to keep such figures.—W. E. B.

<span id="page_207_note_3"></span>[3](#page_207_fr_3) In the mari-mari
dance, the name applied to it by Caribs and Warraus, a row of women
linked together by their arms round waist and shoulder faces a similar
row of men. In the course of the numerous evolutions each side advances
and retires with a rhythmic stamping movement. The idea intended to be
conveyed in the story is that as the women retreated from the row of
men, with their backs toward him, the visitor ran but very little risk
of being seen by them, and yet gained a position of advantage for
carrying out his designs, as will be immediately seen.

<span id="page_207_note_4"></span>[4](#page_207_fr_4) Though in human
form, she still had the attributes and tastes of the Vulture.

<span id="page_207_note_5"></span>[5](#page_207_fr_5) The only people
that a married Indian woman can lawfully seek redress from, a procedure
but very rarely followed, however, are her father and brothers.

<span id="footnotes_page_208">p. 208</span>

<span id="page_208_note_1"></span>[1](#page_208_fr_1) Upon my asking for
further information about the "steps," I was told that this structure
had been erected by the birds specially to admit of their human visitor
reaching the Vulture country.—W. E. R.

<span id="page_208_note_2"></span>[2](#page_208_fr_2) When I expressed
doubt as to the practice of handshaking among the Guiana Indians, my
informant insisted that it certainly constituted the Warrau form of
greeting. Thus, at a party, or on other occasions when the house-master
was expecting friends, he would go to meet his guest halfway between the
water-side and the house, to which, taking him by the hand, he would
lead him. In other words, the salutation was rather in the form of a
hand-lead than of a hand-shake.

<span id="page_208_note_3"></span>[3](#page_208_fr_3) She means to
indicate that the young woman has nobody near to look after and protect
her interests.

<span id="page_208_note_4"></span>[4](#page_208_fr_4) My informant is
firmly convinced that when vultures assume an anthropomorphic form the
wattle-like growth on top of the beak becomes a sort of nose-ring.

<span id="page_208_note_5"></span>[5](#page_208_fr_5) It is not a little
remarkable that all my English-speaking Indian friends invariably employ
this expression "to hear" for "to heed." I have noticed and recorded the
same peculiarity among the Queensland savages. Compare "He that hath
ears to hear, let him hear," used as a preface to many important
statements in the Christian Scriptures.—W. E. R.

<span id="page_208_note_6"></span>[6](#page_208_fr_6) Creoles as well as
English-speaking Indians in the Pomeroon and elsewhere, from the
association of these two species of birds, speak of the Vulture as the
Carrion-Crow Governor or "Boss."

<span id="footnotes_page_209">p. 209</span>

<span id="page_209_note_1"></span>[1](#page_209_fr_1) When a monkey is
barbecued, the digits, owing to muscular contraction, invariably become
strongly flexed.

<span id="footnotes_page_210">p. 210</span>

<span id="page_210_note_1"></span>[1](#page_210_fr_1) It was a custom of
the old-time Warraus thus to castigate themselves with the halves of a
broken arrow ([Sect. *331*](aflg18.htm#pp_331)) to the belief that this
would endue them with strength and courage.

<span id="page_210_note_2"></span>[2](#page_210_fr_2) All that I can
learn from the old Warraus about the stone specially singled out here,
which they called *hebu-bakka*, is that people to the days of long ago
used to wear it on their necklaces, and that it then passed current to
trade and barter in just the same way as does our money. (Cf. [Sect.
*241*](aflg14.htm#pp_241).)—W. E. R.

<span id="footnotes_page_211">p. 211</span>

<span id="page_211_note_1"></span>[1](#page_211_fr_1) Old Warraus have
told me that it was customary thus to open the animal and bury the human
remains, whenever they succeeded in catching any alligator, camudi, or
tiger that had recently secured a human victim.—W. E. R.

<span id="footnotes_page_212">p. 212</span>

<span id="page_212_note_1"></span>[1](#page_212_fr_1) According to Brett
([BrB, 27](../lmbg/lmbg1b.htm#page_27)), this is an Arawak story, but it
is practically identical with the first part of the Makusi legend of
Makunaima and Pia ([Sect. *39*](aflg02.htm#pp_39)).

<span id="page_212_note_2"></span>[2](#page_212_fr_2) According to the
Akawais, during the course of creation Makunaima missed his fire, which
the marudi had accidentally swallowed, and began looking for it and
making inquiries. The other animals told him that the alligator, whom
they all disliked, had stolen it, so he forced open the reptile's mouth
to search, and finding its tongue in the way, pulled it out. The tongue
of the alligator, previous to this calamity, is supposed to have been
long and flexible. ([BrB, 132](../lmbg/lmbg4b.htm#page_132).)

<span id="page_212_note_3"></span>[3](#page_212_fr_3) See [BrB,
29](../lmbg/lmbg1b.htm#page_29).

<span id="page_212_note_4"></span>[4](#page_212_fr_4) I find that this
name should be Annuánna, the carrion crow: indeed it almost would seem
that the legend is but an Arawak version of the latter part of the
Warrau story given in [Sect. *137*](aflg09.htm#pp_137).—W. E. R.

<span id="page_212_note_5"></span>[5](#page_212_fr_5) An Arawak woman
told me that two somewhat similar birds, the Tillili and the Fai-fai-a,
joined the Itiki (the Arawak name for the kiskedee) in playing
malingerers. The Fai-fai-a is now always making kind of moaning noise to
show how much he grieves at not having taken part in the fray.—W .E. R.

<span id="page_212_note_6"></span>[6](#page_212_fr_6) In the Akawai
story of Creation Brett ([BrB, 131](../lmbg/lmbg4b.htm#page_131)) speaks
of the trumpeter bird flying down into a ants' nest, thus getting her
legs, which had previously been nice and plump, picked quite clean. On
the same occasion, the Marudi (*Penelope* sp.), thinking some glowing
hot embers to be an insect, swallowed them, and so got his fiery throat.
Compare Brett's story in [Sect. *162*](aflg09.htm#pp_162).

<span id="page_212_note_7"></span>[7](#page_212_fr_7) Sandals are in
common use in the hinterland of Guiana.

<span id="footnotes_page_213">p. 213</span>

<span id="page_213_note_1"></span>[1](#page_213_fr_1) It is of interest
to note that among the Gran Chaco Indians, the head of a turtle should
be an 'amulet' for hunting deer (Nor, 53).—W. E. R.

<span id="page_213_note_2"></span>[2](#page_213_fr_2) Tobe-horo-anna,
signifying literally in Warrau "Tiger-black-skin," is the name given to
an immense cruelly-savage beast believed to exist in the depths of the
forest. From the information which I have gathered it appears that this
creature is a tiger only when it goes for a walk in the bush; that at
home it is "like a man, people."

<span id="page_213_note_3"></span>[3](#page_213_fr_3) There is some
intimate connection between toads, frogs, and kindred creatures, and
success in the chase. See [Sect. *228*](aflg14.htm#pp_228).

<span id="footnotes_page_214">p. 214</span>

<span id="page_214_note_1"></span>[1](#page_214_fr_1) This was the exact
explanation given when I interrupted my informant, to ascertain *why*
the crying took place.—W. E. R.

<span id="page_214_note_2"></span>[2](#page_214_fr_2) In the Arawak
story of Adaba ([Sect. *145*](aflg09.htm#pp_145)) it is the fungus on
the arrow itself which prevents it hitting the mark.

<span id="page_214_note_3"></span>[3](#page_214_fr_3) In the Arawak
story just referred to fishing-line serves the purpose of the virgin
rope.

<span id="page_218_note_1"></span>[1](#page_218_fr_1) The *Booroo!

Arawak term for a certain frog with a particularly loud croak.

<span id="page_219_note_1"></span>[1](#page_219_fr_1) Most of the clubs
have attached to the handle a cotton ring through which the wrist is

<span id="footnotes_page_221">p. 221</span>

<span id="page_221_note_1"></span>[1](#page_221_fr_1) This word in
Arawak means "broadside."

<span id="page_221_note_2"></span>[2](#page_221_fr_2) There is an island
in the Essequibo just above Groote Creek called hiarono-dulluhing
(woman's pole). The story goes that onre upon a time the women there
were traveling in the old-fashioned way with the paddles edgewise, when
the tide being against them, they fixed the pole as usual in the mud.
But they drove it in so firmly that they could not get it out again,
with the result that it remained there. The timbers, grasses, and sand
collected round it, forming the present island.

<span id="footnotes_page_222">p. 222</span>

<span id="page_222_note_1"></span>[1](#page_222_fr_1) Here follow a
whole series of exploits, all detailing the results consequent on
disobeying the old man's instructions. They arrived at a place where
there was a field full of ripe plantains, of which they are told they
might pick two each, but no more. Among the crew was a greedy man, who
did eat more, and at night the rest of the party were awakened by the
noise caused by his grinding his teeth so loudly: looking into the
hammock whence the noise proceeded, they saw that its occupant had been
changed into a tiger. At another place they passed a house where some
cassava cakes had been left to dry on the troolie roof: there were no
occupants anywhere to be seen, and the old man gave orders that the
cassava was not to be touched. He, being a piai-man, could distinguish
the Yawahus (Spirits), who were invisible to the remainder of the crew.
One of the latter, however, took one of the cakes away, but he had no
sooner proceeded a few steps, than he suddenly disappeared: he had
joined the Spirits. Another scene shows the search party arriving in the
country of the Baboon Tribe, where the old man warns them not to
laugh—laughter would indeed prove the death of them. The Baboons
performed all the dirtiest tricks imaginable to excite the risibilities
of the boat's crew: one of these yielded to the temptation and was made
into pepper pot. And so on.
