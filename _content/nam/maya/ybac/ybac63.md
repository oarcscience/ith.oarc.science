Yucatan in 1579 Showing the Pre-Spanish Maya Chiefdoms (p. 136 and
137)  

The above map, while actually one of northern Yucatan "as Landa left
it," and to be used particularly with the facts given in the Appendix to
this volume, also shows quite dearly some of the different historical
changes in occupation and population. The Eighth Century movement in the

had settled to the 'Spanish form of government,' as ordered on Juan Xiu,
while in the East we have only the surviving trails, (taken from the
Espinosa map), to suggest the ancient population and the seaward
movement to the 'Honduras trade.' The map thus shows, just as does the
present volume, that we are not at the end but only the beginning of our
historical Maya or Itzá research.
