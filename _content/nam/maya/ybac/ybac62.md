### The 1685 page by Juan Xiu.

This page having already been published in Morley's *Inscriptions at
Copan* (Carnegie Inst., 1921), as traced in facsimile, transcribed and
translated with full notes, by the present writer, needs little more
description here than as given above on page 121. It gives a series of
events from 1533 to 1545, in Maya, with the dates given both in full
Maya and European terms. We learn that there was a **maya-cimlal** or
general mortality in 1533 (the very year that the elder Montejo retired
beaten on his first attempt at conquest), the killing of the
"rain-bringer" Napot Xiu at Otzmal in 1536, a hurricane in

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 1538, the founding
of Mérida by the Spaniards in 1542, "and the beginning of the tributes,
by the aid of those of Maní, on the day **5 Ahau**, the 17th of the
month **Tzec**," the battle at Tz’itz’omtun in 1543, and the coming of
Christianity in 1545, with the arrival of the six Franciscan friars.
"Copied on May 29th, 1685, from an ancient book, namely in characters as
they are called, **anares**. I, don Juan Xiu."

Accurate as the dual dating in this paper is, it was rejected as a basis
for correlation by Morley and myself, after long arguments, as being
contrary to what we then believed were settled facts as to the periods
of occupation and non-occupation at Chichén Itzá, and similar points.
Finally we agreed on the correlation given by him in Appendix II to his
Copan book, based on a time-reckoning in vogue among the eastern
Yucatecans or Itzás; owing to the elaborate system of triple checks in
the Maya calendar, the variation between the Itzá and Xiu counts
involved a difference of 260 years in the actually elapsed time from the
zero-date of the Maya time reckoning, now finally fixed at August 13,
3113 B.C., or Julian Day 584, 259. Since then, later discoveries have
corrected the errors above, and shown conclusively the complete
accordance of Juan Xiu's page with the entire series of monumental and
other dates, and giving us a definite check date of Nov. 13, 1539, as
expressible in Maya terms by **11.16.0-0-0, 13 Ahau**, the 8th of the
month **Xul**, that is, 4720 'mathematical' 360-day years from the above
zero-date of the Mayas.

So much we owe to Juan Xiu, Xiu XI, the last of the recognized Xiu local
governors under the Spanish régime, at almost the end of his three score
and ten years.
