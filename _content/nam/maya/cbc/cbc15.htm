<P>It is most necessary to believe this. These are the precious stones which our Lord, the Father, has abandoned.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_299"></A><A HREF="#fn_298"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> This was his first repast, this <I>balch&eacute;</I>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_300"></A><A HREF="#fn_299"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> with which we, the ruling men revere him here. Very rightly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_301"></A><A HREF="#fn_300"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> they worshipped as true gods these precious stones,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_302"></A><A HREF="#fn_301"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> when the true God was established, our Lord God, the Lord of heaven and earth, the true God. Nevertheless, the first gods were perishable gods. Their worship came to its inevitable end. They lost their efficacy by the benediction of the Lord of Heaven, after the redemption of the world was accomplished, after the resurrection of the true God, the true Dios, when he blessed heaven and earth. Then was your worship abolished, Maya men. Turn away your hearts from your &lt;old&gt; religion.</P>
<P>&lt;This is&gt; the history of the world in those times, because it has been written down, because the time has not yet ended for making these books, these many explanations, so that Maya men may be asked if they know how they were born here in this country, when the land was founded.</P>

<P>The two-day throne was declared, the three-day throne. Then began the weeping of Oxlahun-ti-ku. They wept in this reign.

Then there sprang up the bouquet of the priest, the bouquet of the ruler, the bouquet of the captain; this was what the flower-king bore when he descended and nothing else, so they say.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_365"></A><A HREF="#fn_363"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> It was not bread that he bore. Then it was that the flower sprang up, wide open, to introduce the sin of Bolon-ti-ku. &lt;After&gt; three years was the time when he said he did not come to create Bolon <U>&#162;</U>acab as the god in hell.

The flower&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_371"></A><A HREF="#fn_369"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> was his mat, the flower was his chair. He sat in envy, he walked in envy. Envy was his plate, envy was his cup. There was envy in his heart, in his understanding, in his thought and in his speech. Ribald and insolent was his speech during his reign. At that time his food cries out, his drink cries out,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_372"></A><A HREF="#fn_370"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> from the corner of his mouth when he eats, from the back of his claw&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_373"></A><A HREF="#fn_371"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> when he bites his food.

The heart is on fire alone in the fatherless one who despises his father, in the motherless one. He shall walk abroad giving the appearance of one drunk, without understanding, in company with his father, in company with his mother.

<P><A NAME="fn_297"></A><A HREF="cbc15.htm#fr_298">98:2</A> Here we have a creation narrative of the sort described by Aguilar in his report on idolatry in Yucatan written early in the Seventeenth Century. "Furthermore it would be very advantageous if books were printed in the language of these Indians which would treat of Genesis and the creation of the world, because they have fables and histories which are very detrimental. Some of them have had them written down, and they keep them and read them in their assemblies. I had a copybook of this sort, which I took away from a choir-master named Cuytun from the town of Sucopo. He got away from me, and I never could get hold of him to learn the origin of this Genesis of his" (Aguilar 1900, p. 115).</P>

It may have been something like the <I>mut</I>, an unidentified bird of the Cracid&aelig; family (<I>Cf.</I> Maler 1908, p. 132).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_319"></A><A HREF="cbc15.htm#fr_320">100:5</A> We find a portrayal of four trees, each surmounted by a bird, in one of the reliefs of the Temple of the Wall Panels at Chichen Itz&aacute;. (<I>Cf.</I> Plate <A HREF="cbc03.htm#img_pl1c">1, c</A>.) Also on page 1 of the Codex Fej&eacute;rv&aacute;ry-Mayer there is a Mexican picture of the four world-quarters at each of which there is a flowering tree with a bird perched upon it (Apud Seler 1923, p. 15). The <I>yax-che</I> or green tree at the center of the world is probably shown on pages 41-42 of the Maya Codex Cortesianus. This last tree is still remembered by the Maya (<I>Cf.</I> Tozzer 1907, p. 154). In the Ritual of the Four World Quarters found in Chapter I of the present work, these <I>imix</I>-trees, or trees of abundance, are further qualified as being the ceiba tree so prominent in Maya mythology (<I>Cf.</I> p. 64, note &nbsp;<A HREF="cbc06.htm#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_320"></A><A HREF="cbc15.htm#fr_321">101:1</A> Mention of the "plate" and "cup" of the katun is found several times in the Books of Chilam Balam. it is probably a reference to the ceremonies connected with the so-called idol of the katun (<I>Cf.</I> Landa 1929, p. 98). These articles appear to symbolize the numerical coefficient of the day Ahau from which the katun took its name. On page <A HREF="cbc27.htm#page_150">150</A> it is said of Katun 9 Ahau: "Nine was its plate, nine was its cup."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_321"></A><A HREF="cbc15.htm#fr_322">101:2</A> Lahun Chaan is doubtless the same as the "Lakunchan" described by Cogolludo as an idol with very ugly teeth. <I>Lahun</I> means ten in both Maya and Chol, and <I>chan</I> means sky, heaven and serpent in Chol. The Maya word for sky is <I>caan</I>. It seems likely that Lahun Chaan is a borrowed foreign word and means the god of the tenth heaven. On page 47 of the Dresden Codex we find a picture (<A HREF="#img_fig24">fig. 24</A>) accompanied by a glyph composed of the number ten and an element which is generally accepted as the symbol of the sky or heavens. The picture is that of a deity whose face resembles that of the God B, or rain-god; but it lacks the curved ornament over the nose, and instead of the protruding tooth at the side of the mouth there is a fleshless lower jaw. Also skeleton-like ribs are painted on the front of the torso. We recall that a fleshless jawbone is one of the symbols of the number ten on the monuments; but the figure appears to be the regent of the second Venus period in the Dresden Codex, and the regent of the first of these periods in the Mexican Codex Bologna also has a fleshless lower jaw. Since the above passage in the Chumayel implies that Lahun Chaan was set in the west, the translator is inclined to believe that this god was closely connected with the appearance of Venus as an evening star. Cogolludo's mention of the "ugly teeth" may be a reference to the fleshless lower jaw in the picture (<I>Cf.</I> Cogolludo Bk. 4, Chap. 8).</P>

Beltran spells it Itzam-cab-ain, and defines it simply as whale, though it could mean literally Itzam-the-earth-crocodile. In either case, we are forcibly reminded of the fabled earth-monster which appears in the Dresden Codex (pp. 4 and 5) with the head of Itzamn&aacute; between its jaws.</P>
<P>The Mexicans believed that the gods created "in the water a great fish, which is called <I>cip&aacute;ctli</I> and which is like a crocodile, and from this fish they made the earth" (Hist. de los Mexicanos por sus pinturas, Chap. 2). On page 27 of the Codex Borgia we see this earth-monster with the head and claws of a crocodile and with maize sprouting from its back (Seler 1923, pp. 10, 11).</P>

The Maya employed torches of pitch-pine (<I>taht&eacute;</I>) or of the <I>Viguiera dentata</I> HBK (<I>tah</I>) for lighting.

<P><A NAME="fn_327"></A><A HREF="cbc15.htm#fr_328">102:2</A> The yax-cheel-cab, or first tree of the world is believed to be a giant ceiba which grows in the exact center of the earth and rears its branches through successive holes in the various heavens (Tozzer 1907, p. 154). Avenda&ntilde;o describes the representation of this mythological tree as "the fragment of a column, of round stone, the circumference of each part of which is about three quarters of a yard across and one quarter high. It is made of stones placed on top of each other with mortar of lime and <I>cah cab</I> (<I>zahcab</I>), which is usually used for that purpose; and the middle is filled in with bitumen, so that it is like a table with a round pedestal, upon which and set in the foundation of the said stone column, there stands out toward the West a stone mask, very ill-formed . . . The said column is called, in the name by which they worship it, Yax cheel cab, which means in their language, 'the first tree in the world,' and, as it is understood in their old songs (which few people understand) they wish to have it known they worship it because it was the tree of whose fruit our first father Adam ate, who in their language is called Ixanom" (Means 1917, p. 135).</P>

As ruler of the ninth and deepest hell, he sits upon the mat, the symbol of authority, and comprises in himself the idea of the gods of the nine under-worlds. <I>Cf.</I> Codex Vaticanus No. 3738, f. l v. apud Seler 1923, p. 21.</P>

The mat (<I>pop</I>) and throne (&#162;am) have the figurative significance of toil, misery and misfortune. (Motul, 1930, p. 694.) Consequently the expression could also mean "he who alleviates misfortunes." <I>Cf.</I> Tizimin, pp. 7, 8 and 25; Codex Perez, pp. 78, 82, 83, 107, 108, 153 and 161.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_341"></A><A HREF="cbc15.htm#fr_343">103:8</A> Maya, <I>bul cum</I>, might mean "all down" literally. Its translation here is based on the contexts in which it occurs.

<P><A NAME="fn_366"></A><A HREF="cbc15.htm#fr_368">105:6</A> The five-petaled flower, or <I>nict&eacute;</I>, is without doubt the Plumeria. The red Plumeria and the white Plumeria are considered the father and mother respectively of Nohochacyum, the head of the Lacandon Pantheon (Tozzer 1907, p. 93).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_375"></A><A HREF="cbc15.htm#fr_377">105:15</A> A blindfolded god is pictured on page 50 of the Dresden Codex, and the blurred faces of the Lords of the Katuns on page <A HREF="cbc26.htm#page_144">144</A> of the Chumayel are believed to represent the same thing.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_378"></A><A HREF="cbc15.htm#fr_380">106:3</A> It seems likely that the Maya compiler has inadvertently written Bolon Chan for Lahun Chan. <I>Bolon</I> means nine, and <I>lahun</I> means ten. No personage by the name of Bolon Chan is known to the translator, while Lahun Chan is well known. See p. 101, note &nbsp;<A HREF="#fn_321"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_379"></A><A HREF="cbc15.htm#fr_381">106:4</A> The <I>than</I> of the katun is translated as its "law," following the explanation on page 171 of the Kaua MS., where it is defined as "<I>ordenanzas</I>." The expression recurs so frequently in this book that an explanation seems to be required. Primarily than means word, speech or language, but it also has a number of different meanings when employed figuratively. If it were not for this definition in the same context in the Kaua MS., we should be inclined to translate it as "the force, power and duration" of the katun. See Motul 1930, p. 875.</P>
