<P>(2. Historical introduction to the katun-prophecies.)</P>
<P>In Katun 13 Ahau the ship of the foreigners first appeared at Campeche. 1541 was the name of the year when they brought the news that the Maya men were to enter into Christianity, when the land of Tantun Cuzamil was established. They were there for half a year. Then they went to the seaport to the west and the people of Chikin-Chel&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_694"></A><A HREF="#fn_691"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> were put under tribute. It was the year 1542 when the district of Tihoo, Ichcanziho,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_695"></A><A HREF="#fn_692"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> was established, in Katun 11 Ahau. The first governor was the Adelantado Don Francisco Montejo who was to appoint subjects&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_696"></A><A HREF="#fn_693"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> for the foreigners, mighty men. In the year 1542 tribute was introduced. A. D. 1545 was the year when the Padres arrived, four years after the arrival of the foreigners. Then it was that men were baptised from town to town by &lt;the Padres&gt;. When they first arrived the towns were distributed among them.</P>
<P>1544 was the year . . . six hundred years and seventy-five years after the town of Chichen Itz&aacute; was depopulated,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_697"></A><A HREF="#fn_694"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> after its settlements were depopulated. &lt;It was&gt; eight hundred years and seventy years after the town of Uxmal was depopulated, after the people were driven out of its towns.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_698"></A><A HREF="#fn_695"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></P>
<P>In the year 1537, on a day named 9 Cauac, was when the nobles gathered at the town of Mani to discuss fully whether they should go and bring the foreigners to their settlements because the head-chief had been killed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_699"></A><A HREF="#fn_696"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> These</P>

This was the year when the strangers in the land, the foreigners who ate annonas, passed. They were the first to distribute the towns. It was when the foreigners arrived that the "receivers" received them.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_704"></A><A HREF="#fn_701"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> When they assembled at Campeche, when their ships came forth, then the nobles went to give gifts to them.

<FONT SIZE=1><P>Each prophecy of this series is headed by an illustration similar to this one. It consists of a crowned head, and the crown is surmounted by a cross. It evidently represents a so-called "ruler" mentioned in a number of the prophecies, but there is some uncertainty as to the function of his personage in connection with each new katun. In the Tizimin (p. 22) and Mani (Code. Perez, p. 120) manuscripts we read of a certain Katun 8 Ahau that "the ruler of the people of Uxmal was painted." It is possible that this means that a picture of this ruler headed the prophecy for the katun: but Katun 8 Ahau "was established" at Izamal and not Uxmal according to the present series of katun-prophecies</FONT>.</TD>

<P><A NAME="fn_691"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_694">145:2</A> Chikin-chel (lit. west woods) was the native province immediately to the south of Rio de Lagartos. Its chief city was Chauach&aacute;, a name also given to the entire province (Relaciones de Yucatan, II, p. 7).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_692"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_695">145:3</A> Merida was founded on the site of an ancient city named Ichcanziho in the older narratives. At the time of the Spanish conquest it was called Tihoo, which still continues to be the Maya name of the capital.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_693"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_696">145:4</A> Maya <I>chinam</I>, a word probably borrowed from the Nahuatl. It is defined by Pio Perez as "town," but it can also mean subjects, as in the <I>Carta de diez caciques</I>: "<I>a chinamob tulacal cech ah-tepale</I>," "all the subjects of Your Majesty" (Martinez, Ed. 1930, p. 59). The reference is probably to the establishment of <I>encomiendas</I>, but the towns may be meant.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_694"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_697">145:5</A> Here probably a tun of 360 days is meant instead of a year of 365 days, although the latter is stated. No mention of the inhabitants of Chichen Itz&aacute; being driven out at this time has yet been noted.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_695"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_698">145:6</A> This suggests the conquest of some ancient city at Uxmal long before the Xiu occupation of the site, but we know nothing of either conquerors or conquered.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_696"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_699">145:7</A> In spite of the statement as it stands we believe that by 9 Cauac the name of the year is intended. As we have previously noted, the Xiu head-chief was murdered in a year 8 Cauac which lasted from the middle of 1536 to the middle of 1537. The following year was 9 Kan. This paragraph has been translated and there is a full discussion of the matter in Morley 1920, pages 478-487. Yucatan had been abandoned by the Spaniards, and in 1537 a small expedition under Godoy returned to Champoton (Molina Sol&iacute;s 1896, p. 551).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_698"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_701">146:2</A> Montejo established his headquarters for a time at <U>&#162;</U>ibilkal, four leagues west or southwest of Merida, just prior to capturing the latter site in 1541. The mention here of an emissary from this town and the neighboring Caucel indicates that the assembly took place in 1541 and not in 1537. Molina Sol&iacute;s states that an embassy was sent from Mani to <U>&#162;</U>ibilkal at this time (Molina Sol&iacute;s 1896, p. 624).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_699"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_702">146:3</A> Where the edge of the page is torn, the title or official name of Tutul Xiu has been supplied from the Cr&oacute;nica de Oxkutzcab, page 66, apud Morley 1920, page 507. Here it is given as Ah Dun Tutul Xiu.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_700"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_703">146:4</A> The year 10 Kan (<I>lahun Kan</I>) began in 1525 prior to Montejo's arrival and could not recur for fifty two years. Probably 13 Kan (<I>oxlahun Kan</I>) is intended. The latter year began in July 1541.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_701"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_704">146:5</A> Nakuk Pech tells of accompanying such an embassy to the Spaniards at Campeche (Brinton 1882, p. 219).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_702"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_705">146:6</A> The council at Mani which discussed going to meet the Spaniards was also composed of thirteen members. Possibly they were to be the actual ambassadors. Among the Maya thirteen had a symbolic meaning.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_703"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_706">146:7</A> The events mentioned here occurred in Katun 11 Ahau and not in 9 Ahau.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_704"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_707">146:8</A> Chactemal and Tahuaymil are both names given to the native province better known as Chetumal. It lies just north of British Honduras. <I>Ah-uaymi</I> is defined as an animal resembling the opossum (Motul). Holtun Itz&aacute; might be translated as "the gate of the Itz&aacute;." The district was the embarking point for considerable commerce with what is now the Republic of Honduras. <I>Cf.</I> Relaciones de Yucatan, II, page 179. There is a town named Chichimila a few miles south of Valladolid. There was also a town of Chactemal, or "Chetemal," located by Cogolludo (Bk. 9, Chap. 6) on what is now Chetumal Bay, three leagues east of the mouth of the Rio Hondo, called <I>Nohukum</I> by the Maya. This town was the capital of the native province of the same name and the residence of Nachan Can, the ruler or one of the rulers of the province (Herrera 1726, Dec. 3, book 4, chap. 2).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_706"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_709">147:2</A> The idea of a seal on a book was probably taken from the Spaniards, but the Maya were familiar with clay stamps used to decorate pottery and possibly also to mark designs on the human body.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_707"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_710">147:3</A> This is the book mentioned on pages 13 and 29 of the Tizimin MS. and on page 115 of the Codex Perez. This book is stated to have been either written or copied on a day 11 Chuen, 18 Zac, February 15th, 1544.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_709"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_712">147:5</A> Mention has already been made in this book of Holtun Balam and Ah Mex-cue. They appear to have been contemporaries of Hunac Ceel (<I>Cf.</I> pp. <A HREF="cbc07.htm#page_69">69</A> and <A HREF="cbc07.htm#page_74">74</A>). Zacal Puc is probably the "Cacal Puc" referred to in the famous Valladolid law-suit of 1618 (<I>Cf.</I> Brinton 1882, p. 117). He was one of several leaders who came to found towns at Chichen Itz&aacute;, Bacalar and on the coast of Yucatan to the north. It is specifically stated that these men came from Mexico, and that they ruled in Yucatan for a long time. The period of their arrival is not recorded here, but we find the statement elsewhere that the Maya had been subject to certain Mexicans six hundred years prior to the Spanish Conquest (Aguilar 1892, p. 92).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_710"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_713">147:6</A> <I>Cf.</I> p. 89, note &nbsp;<A HREF="cbc14.htm#fn_239"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. The reference is to the catechism which the chiefs were obliged to undergo every katun to prove that they held their positions legitimately.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_711"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_714">147:7</A> Nothing is known of this personage. Coyi is a well-known family name among the Maya.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_715"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_718">148:2</A> Maya, <I>nict&eacute;</I>, literally the Plumeria flower, and figuratively the carnal sin for which it was the symbol. <I>Cf.</I> page 104, note &nbsp;<A HREF="cbc15.htm#fn_360"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_716"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_719">148:3</A> Here instead of the Maya word for circle, a ring is drawn. There is a stereotyped expression in Maya meaning the same thing: <I>zac petahom</I> canal, which frequently occurs in the prophecies and is usually associated with drought (<A HREF="cbc28.htm#page_164">p. 164</A>). Here, as in Christian legends, it appears to be a halo encircling a celestial vision, the child Jesus, "the fair-skinned boy."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_717"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_720">148:4</A> Maya, <I>uaom che</I>. The Spanish missionaries translated this as cross (Villagutierre 1701, p. 37). It was probably the symbolic tree of Maya mythology. According to the prophecy of Chilam Balam a bird was perched on it (<I>Cf.</I> <A HREF="cbc29.htm#page_167">p. 167</A>).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_718"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_721">148:5</A> Literally, the distance a cry can be heard, the distance after which the traveler sets down his pack and rests.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_719"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_722">148:6</A> Maya, <I>mut</I>, may mean either news, or an unidentified bird of the Cracid&aelig; family (Maler 1908, p. 132). In Chol, Chontal and Tzotzil <I>mut</I> is a general term meaning bird (Stoll 1884, p. 54). <I>Cf.</I> page 100, note &nbsp;<A HREF="cbc15.htm#fn_318"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_720"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_723">148:7</A> Probably a reference to the construction of Spanish cities and churches with native labor.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_721"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_724">148:8</A> Maya, <I>zac ibteelob</I>; the translation is doubtful, but certainly it is a term of contempt. Compare the use of the same expression on pages <A HREF="#page_155">155</A> and <A HREF="#page_156">156</A>.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_730"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_733">150:1</A> Maya, <I>hool-poop</I>, literally "he who sits at the head of the mat." These scattered hamlets were destroyed by the missionaries after the Conquest and their inhabitants forced to live together in the towns where they could more easily be christianized. The practise was criticized in the reports of the encomenderos, as it caused a serious diminution of the native population. <I>Cf.</I> Relaciones de Yucatan, II, page 187.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_731"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_734">150:2</A> Maya, <I>yocol haa tac polob</I>, literally "the water entered to our heads."</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_733"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_736">150:4</A> Maya, <I>chachac ek</I>, the red stars. By <I>chac ek</I> the morning star is usually meant, probably the planet Venus. In the Venus table of the Dresden Codex the glyph for red is always prefixed to the Venus-sign. Here, however, the seven planets of medieval astronomy are plainly intended: Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_734"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_737">150:5</A> Maya, <I>taninah</I>. The translator is not familiar with this word. The translation given is based on its resemblance to <I>tanlah</I>, meaning to serve.</P>

The name is spelled Yax-Cocay-mut in the Tizimin MS. (p. 25) which might be translated as "the green fire-fly bird." Avenda&ntilde;o saw at Tayasal a mask set in a stone column which he identified as Ah-Cocah-mut. "I came to recognize it, since I had already read about it in their old papers and had seen it in their Anahtes, which they use, which are books of the barks of trees, polished and covered with lime, in which by painted figures and characters, they have foretold their future events. By which means I knew that there was found in the said Peten Itz&aacute; the said idol of Yaxchecab, that of Cocahmut, that of Ytzimna (Itzamna) Kauil, which means "horse of the devil" (Bowditch, unpublished translation p. 67.

<P><A NAME="fn_765"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_768">154:3</A> The Maya word <I>pek</I> primarily means a dog, and among its rather numerous secondary meanings are water-tank, chills and fever, and a certain skin disease.

<P><A NAME="fn_821"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_826">158:8</A> Probably a reference to the story of Antonio Mart&iacute;nez. <I>Cf.</I> <A HREF="cbc20.htm#page_123">p. 123</A>, and p. 157, note &nbsp;<A HREF="#fn_808"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_822"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_827">158:9</A> This katun is really the seventh in the series.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_823"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_828">158:10</A> This place-name has survived only as the name of a hacienda in the Department of Izamal. It is, however, frequently associated with Mayapan in these pages and may be another name for this city.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_824"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_829">158:11</A> Yaxal Chuen appears to be an important deity and probably a constellation as well. The name might be translated as the green or first artisan. We find on pp. 23, 24 of the Codex Peresianus a glyph composed of the elements, <I>yax</I> and <I>chuen</I>, which may refer to this deity (Gates 1910, p. 30). These are the pages containing the figures which represent the thirteen divisions of the Maya zodiac.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_825"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_830">158:12</A> The text appears to be corrupt here.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_826"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_831">158:13</A> Maya, <I>hunac ah-menil</I>. Among the modern Maya <I>ah-men</I> means sorcerer.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_827"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_832">158:14</A> As a result of the five years of famine, 1650 to 1654, enormous numbers of Indians had left their towns and were scattered in the forests. In 1652 an unsuccessful attempt had been made by the Spanish authorities to bring them back to their homes, but it seems likely that during the following katun they gradually returned to their homes. <I>Cf.</I> Molina Sol&iacute;s 1910, p. 231.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_828"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_833">159:1</A> <I>Cf.</I> Appendix F.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_829"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_834">159:2</A> The golden gates (<I>u puertail takin</I>) are probably the gilded gates to the chancel of the church. The town marriages perhaps refer to the marriages of many people at one time, when the people had returned to the towns after living for some years in the forests and mating without ecclesiastical sanction. Can-kaz-na, here translated as the official building, means literally "the house of four apartments."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_830"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_835">159:3</A> The return to the towns meant also a return to the regulations governing the Indians. One such law regarding dress reads: "that all shall manage to wear footgear, at least hemp sandals" (Cogolludo 1868, book 5, chap. 19).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_831"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_836">159:4</A> Maya, <I>nicte katun</I>, literally the katun of the Plumeria flower. <I>Cf.</I> page 104, note &nbsp;<A HREF="cbc15.htm#fn_360"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A>. This is the fourth katun-prophecy in which we find this reference; the others were Katuns 11, 7 and 5 Ahau.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_832"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_837">159:5</A> Maya, <I>conbil</I>, also means that which is for sale.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_833"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_838">159:6</A> We are reminded of the "Nine Mountains" mentioned on page <A HREF="cbc25.htm#page_139">139</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_834"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_839">159:7</A> Maya, <I>chac ek</I>, the morning star. (Motul.) <I>Cf.</I> p. 150, note &nbsp;<A HREF="#fn_733"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. In Mexican mythology we find a close association between Quetzalcoatl and the planet Venus.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_835"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_840">159:8</A> The text reads <I>pa hool chace</I>, which we have rendered as Pap-hool-chac and which is probably the Ppappholchac mentioned by Lizana, who translates it "<I>casa de las cabezas y rayos</I>." It was the name of one of the pyramids at Izamal and was said to be the dwelling of the priests of the gods (Lizana 1893, p. 5).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_836"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_841">159:9</A> Chabl&eacute; was a town of some importance in the district of Bacalar at the time of the Conquest, but it was already depopulated in Cogolludo's time (Cogolludo 1868, Book 2, chap. 6). Berendt lists a port of that name in Yucatan, also a town in Tabasco (Berendt, Nombres proprios en lengua Maya). It is still a family name in Yucatan.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_837"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_842">159:10</A> A possible alternative translation could be: the ladder is forcibly broken over, etc. We do not know the significance of the ladder among the Maya, possibly one is intended in the accompanying picture. We find a picture of a ladder on page 34 of the Dresden Codex in connection with a ceremony said to represent a human sacrifice.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_838"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_843">159:11</A> Extensive forest fires have never been reported from Yucatan, and we probably have here only an exaggerated description of extreme heat and drought.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_839"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_844">159:12</A> Maya, <I>u colel caan</I>, a term usually applied to the Holy Virgin.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_840"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_845">159:13</A> Maya, <I>u ye katun</I>, literally, that which the katun sets before us. <I>U yekabtun</I> would mean an offering of precious stone.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_841"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_846">160:1</A> Maya, <I>ah nunob</I>, a term applied several times to the Itz&aacute; in these pages. This would indicate a foreign origin for the Itz&aacute;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_842"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_847">160:2</A> This reference to Kinich Kakmo is capable of two explanations. It may be merely a reference to the god of this name as the idol or presiding deity of the katun. It is very possible, however, that it is a historical allusion to the man, Kinich Kakmo, who was later deified. Gaspar Antonio Chi collaborated with Crist&oacute;bal S&aacute;nchez in writing a report which states that "in course of time the inhabitants of the said town (Izamal) were conquered by Kak-u-pacal and a hundred valorous captains formerly of the town of Mayapan, and that those who founded this place were called Kinich-Kabul, Kinich Kakmo and others from whom descend the Xool, Mo and Coyi &lt;families&gt;, Indians so named in this province" (Relaciones de Yucatan, I, pp. 119-120). Mo or Moo (parrot) is still a common family name among the Maya, and it will be noted that it is one of the elements of the name, Kinich Kakmo, which means sun-eyed fire-parrot. <I>Cf.</I> p. 141, note &nbsp;<A HREF="cbc26.htm#fn_671"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_843"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_848">160:3</A> Supplied from the Tizimin version of this prophecy which is more complete (Tizimin p. 32). One of the objects in the accompanying picture may be intended for a shield and two arrows.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_844"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_849">160:4</A> Supplied from Tizimin (p. 32). The Maya <I>pak</I>, here translated as wall, can also mean a water-tank. Motul, Spanish-Maya portion. This is the only mention of the episode of cementing human heads into a wall that we find anywhere. Possibly what is meant is that a tzompantli was erected, and the stakes transfixing the heads were set in a wall of masonry.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_845"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_850">160:5</A> For the accounts of the sojourn of the Itz&aacute; at Chakanputun see page <A HREF="cbc24.htm#page_136">136</A> and page <A HREF="cbc26.htm#page_141">141</A>, note 4. Chakanputun is generally believed to be the modern Champoton in southwestern Yucatan. The translator is uncertain whether or not to accept this identification, as excellent reasons could be cited both for and against it.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_846"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_851">161:1</A> It is suggested here that at Uxmal they erected stel&aelig; as katun monuments.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_847"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_852">161:2</A> The reference is probably to the idol of the katun.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_848"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_853">161:3</A> Here doubtless referring to the introduction of certain erotic religious festivals like the one described by Landa (1928, p. 156).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_849"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_854">161:4</A> The Tizimin version of this prophecy substitutes the expression "<I>u kochob</I> (the punishment of their guilt) shall descend," instead of "God the Father."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_850"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_855">161:5</A> Here the count recommences for no apparent reason. The feathers in the picture no doubt represent Kukulcan, or Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent. The stars in the picture may refer to the four Venus periods of the Dresden Codex. It will be recalled that the Mexicans believed that Quetzalcoatl became the planet Venus after his death.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_851"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_856">161:6</A> This agrees with the Maya chronicles which place the second occupation of Chichen Itz&aacute; by the Itz&aacute; in a Katun 4 Ahau which fell in the Tenth Century A.D. (Appendix H).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_853"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_858">161:8</A> Nothing is known of this personage. <I>Kante</I> is a tree which yields a yellow dye.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_855"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_860">161:10</A> This statement is important as it enables us to date the beginning of the worship of Kukulcan at Chichen Itz&aacute; which was accompanied by a number of new architectural features at that city. <I>Cf.</I> Landa 1928, pages 62-68, and Relaciones de Yucatan, I, page 121. The Tizimin version of this prophecy is even more explicit than the Chumayel, for it says: "Kukulcan shall come with the Itz&aacute;." Although Torquemada (Book 3, chap. 7) says that Quetzalcoatl went to "Onohualco," a term comprising Tabasco, Campeche and Yucatan, the writer is inclined to doubt that the Kukulcan who came to Chichen Itz&aacute; in the Tenth Century was the actual culture-hero, who is supposed to have lived about the Seventh Century. Like the Kukulcan mentioned in the Tizimin (p. 23) in connection with the Hunac Ceel episode about 1200 A.D., this was probably also a ruler who bore as a title the name of the deified hero.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_856"></A><A HREF="cbc27.htm#fr_861">162:1</A> Probably Maya Cuzamil, Mayapan, is intended as stated in the following prophecy.</P>
