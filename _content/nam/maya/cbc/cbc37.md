In the above table it is the end of the katun that is dated, as the
katun is named for the day on which it ends. The Christian dates are
taken from a similar table compiled by Dr. Morley <span
id="fr_1092"></span>[1](#fn_1085) and are in accordance with the
well-known Morley-Spinden correlation of Maya and Christian chronology.
According to the Goodman-Martinez-Thompson correlation each of the
Christian dates given above should be three years later.

Although there is only a variation of about three years between the two
correlations so far as the katun count of the Books of Chilam Balam is
concerned, they differ by about 259 years in their interpretations of
the Initial Series dates of the monuments in terms of European
chronology. According to the former correlation, the end of the last
Katun 13 Ahau before the Spanish Conquest fell on 12. 9. 0. 0. 0. 13
Ahau 8 Kankin, in the year 1536. <span id="fr_1093"></span>[2](#fn_1086)
The latter correlation, however, places the end of the same Katun 13
Ahau on 11. 16. 0. 0. 0. 13 Ahau 8 Xul, in the year 1539. <span

The only two possible references to the Long Count known to the writer
are those which we have seen on pages 79 and 83 of the present work, and
these unfortunately are somewhat vague. In the former it is stated that
the mounds in Yucatan were constructed during a period of "three score
and fifteen katuns." Evidently referring to the Maya, the latter passage
tells us: "Four four-hundreds of years and fifteen score years was the
end of their lives." In the Books of Chilam Balam we find occasional
references to the *haab*, or 365 day year, when the *tun* of 360 days is
plainly meant. Consequently in terms of the Long Count we have on page
[79](cbc08.htm#page_79) a mention of a period which would be recorded on
the monuments as 3. 15. 0. 0. 0.; and on page [83](cbc10.htm#page_83)
the period referred to would be 4. 15. 0. 0. 0. These two statements are
indefinite in several important respects. No date in the Long Count is
given as a starting point. No current Maya day, month, year or katun is
given as the end of either of these periods. Although the implication is
that Maya civilization came to an end at the close of these periods,
native writers differ somewhat

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

as to just when the end came. Some of them considered that it ended
early in Katun 13 Ahau, as predicted by the prophet Chilam Balam, while
many others very logically put the end either at the close of Katun 13
Ahau or at the foundation of Merida in 1542. If we make the assumption
that these three score katuns and "four four-hundreds of years" refer to
the even baktuns of the Long Count and then add fifteen katuns, it is of
interest to note that the date 11. 15. 0. 0. 0. falls on a day 2 Ahau,
which is also the name of the last day of the katun immediately
preceding the Spanish invasion of Yucatan.

According to the 1539 correlation Katun 2 Ahau, the last katun prior to
the Spanish invasion, ended in 1519, and its position in the Long Count
was 11. 15. 0. 0. 0.   2 Ahau 8 Zac. Subtracting 3. 15. 0. 0. 0. from
this we reach the date 8. 0. 0. 0. 0., or very near the time when the
Maya must have begun to record their chronology on imperishable media.
The oldest contemporaneous date is 8. 6. 4. 2. 17. which is recorded on
the Tuxtla Statuette. If we subtract from 11. 15. 0. 0. 0. the other
period mentioned in the Chumayel, 4. 15. 0. 0. 0., the count will be
carried back to 7. 0. 0. 0. 0. which is believed to be the general
period when Maya Chronology was first developed. <span
id="fr_1095"></span>[1](#fn_1088) In other words, either of the totals
given in the Chumayel Manuscript, counted backward from 11. 15. 0. 0.
0., will reach an Initial Series value which we now believe is about the
time that Maya chronology, in the first case, was actually inaugurated
and, in the other case, was first committed to stone. No such
interesting conditions will arise, however, if the 12. 9. 0. 0. 0.
correlation is used. To this extent the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel
tends to support the former correlation against the latter. We also have
here an indication that the Maya calendar continued unbroken, except for
the shift of a single day in the Year Bearer, from the time of the
inscriptions down to that of the Spanish occupation of Yucatan. <span

such a subtraction as suggested above.
