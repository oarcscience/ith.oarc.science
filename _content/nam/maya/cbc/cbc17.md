### (A SONG OF THE ITZÁ)

Damascus was the name of the plain where our first father, Adam, was
created by God. This was his name, his first name was Adam, after his
soul entered &lt;into him&gt;, after Paradise was set up. After Adam had
then been created, then was created our first mother, Eve, the first
woman, the mother of the whole world. Drops of moisture formed on the
stones and bushes for the first time, <span
id="fr_434"></span>[1](#fn_432) they say, created when there was no sky.

But &lt;God&gt; the Father was created alone and by his own effort in
the darkness. But the stones were created separately. <span
id="fr_435"></span>[2](#fn_433) This was the land of Acantun. <span
id="fr_436"></span>[3](#fn_434) This was created after Adam was formed
also. They were put in the place where the Acans are. Thus it was that
he named them when he created them all. These were the first people.

God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit, these are the joint
&lt;names&gt; of God. They were created in the stone, the red slender
stone and the worn stone of grace. His name is the Word, Josustin
Graçia. <span id="fr_437"></span>[4](#fn_435)

However, at the same time there was born in the stone, the black stone
of terror, the one named Verbum-tuorum, Ix-coal-tun, Ix-coal-cab, <span
id="fr_438"></span>[5](#fn_436) taken by the mistress of the
world. <span id="fr_439"></span>[6](#fn_437) Then there was set in its
place the thrice seasoned heaven, <span id="fr_440"></span>[7](#fn_438)
the seasoned heaven. White and clean, it lay guarded in the heart of
*Sustinal Gracia*. <span id="fr_441"></span>[8](#fn_439) Thirteen orders
of katuns <span id="fr_442"></span>[9](#fn_440) lay prostrate in the
stone. Then the ruler, Hunac Ceel, stirred into motion. <span
id="fr_443"></span>[10](#fn_441)

The song: <span id="fr_444"></span>[11](#fn_442) Ho! What is so precious
as we are? It is the precious jewel &lt;worn on the breast.&gt; Ho! What
is the distinction of righteous men? It is my mantle, my loin-cloth. So
spoke the god. Then do you mourn for anyone?

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

\[paragraph continues\] No one. A tender boy <span
id="fr_445"></span>[1](#fn_443) was I at Chic~~h~~en, when the evil man,
the master of the army, <span id="fr_446"></span>[2](#fn_444) came to
seize the land. Woe! <span id="fr_447"></span>[3](#fn_445) /

At Chic~~h~~en Itzá heresy was favored! <span
id="fr_448"></span>[4](#fn_446) *Yulu uayano*! <span
id="fr_449"></span>[5](#fn_447) Ho! 1 Imix was the day when the ruler
was seized at Chikin-c~~h~~en. <span id="fr_450"></span>[6](#fn_448) Ho!
Where thou art, there is the god. Ho! 1 Imix was the day he said this.
At Chic~~h~~en Itzá heresy was favored! Yulu uayano! Buried,
buried! <span id="fr_451"></span>[7](#fn_449) This was their cry.
Buried, buried! This they also knew <span
id="fr_452"></span>[8](#fn_450) . . . This also was their cry on that
first day of Yaxkin, that mighty day, 2 Akbal, they came. Woe! Woe! Woe!
*Yulu uayano*! Is there perhaps anyone who by chance has awakened? Force
was brought to bear for the second time. <span
id="fr_453"></span>[9](#fn_451) Woe! For the third time was established
the religious festival <span id="fr_454"></span>[10](#fn_452) of our
enemies, <span id="fr_455"></span>[11](#fn_453) our enemies.
*Uuiyao*! <span id="fr_456"></span>[12](#fn_454) Soon it will come to
Chic~~h~~en Itzá, &lt;where&gt; heresy was favored. *Yulu uayano*!
&lt;In&gt; the third heaven is the sun. <span
id="fr_457"></span>[13](#fn_455) Behold! Who am I said to be among
men? <span id="fr_458"></span>[14](#fn_456) I am a leafy covering. <span
id="fr_459"></span>[15](#fn_457) Eya! Who am I among the people of
Putun? <span id="fr_460"></span>[16](#fn_458) You do not understand me.
*Eya*! I was

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

created in the night. What were we born? *Eya*! We were &lt;like&gt;
tame animals &lt;to&gt; Mizcit Ahau. <span
id="fr_461"></span>[1](#fn_459) &lt;But&gt; an end comes to his roguery.
Behold, so I remember my song. <span id="fr_462"></span>[2](#fn_460)
Heresy was favored. *Yulu uayano*! *Eya*! I die, he said, because of the
town festival. <span id="fr_463"></span>[3](#fn_461) *Eya*! I shall
come, he said, because of the destruction of the town. This is the end
&lt;of what is&gt; in his mind, of what he thought in his heart. Me, he
did not destroy. I tell what I have remembered in my song. Heresy was
favored. *Yulu uayano*! /

This is all of the song, the completion of the message of the Lord
God. <span id="fr_464"></span>[4](#fn_462)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_432"></span>[114:1](cbc17.htm#fr_434) "But there went up a
mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground." Genesis
II, 6.

<span id="fn_433"></span>[114:2](cbc17.htm#fr_435) Alternative
translation: But others were created separately.

<span id="fn_434"></span>[114:3](cbc17.htm#fr_436) Acantun could be
translated as a stone set up on a foundation. The four Acantuns were
stone .columns set up to represent the four Bacabs at the New Years'
ceremonies (Landa 1929, pp. 22-40). *Cf.* Dresden MS. pp. 25C-28C.

<span id="fn_435"></span>[114:4](cbc17.htm#fr_437) Perhaps *Josué
sustina gracia* is intended, a pious interpolation which might mean:
Jesus, the sustaining grace, the maize plant which sustains us.

<span id="fn_436"></span>[114:5](cbc17.htm#fr_438) These names might be
translated, the harlot born of the stone, the harlot born of the earth.
Here is doubtless a reference to the black pustules of the corn-smut.

<span id="fn_437"></span>[114:6](cbc17.htm#fr_439) "The mistress of
heaven" was a term applied to the Holy Virgin; here we may have the
direct opposite.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[114:7](cbc17.htm#fr_440) Maya:
*ox-cocox-caan*. Cocox is a term applied to cacao which has seasoned or
ripened on the tree, also a fruit which withers on the tree before it
ripens.

<span id="fn_439"></span>[114:8](cbc17.htm#fr_441) *Sustinal Gracia*
probably refers to the growing maize.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[114:9](cbc17.htm#fr_442) Alternative
translation, Thirteen times eight thousand katuns.

<span id="fn_441"></span>[114:10](cbc17.htm#fr_443) *Uilim*, here
translated as motion, is an unusual word. *Uil*, among other meanings,
could signify the stirring of leaves or branches. *Uii* is a tuberous
root, and the phrase has been translated: "*se movió la semilla del
Senor Hunac Ceel*" (Mediz Bolio 1930, p. 68).

<span id="fn_442"></span>[114:11](cbc17.htm#fr_444) *Kay* (song) is
written in the margin in what appears to be the hand of the compiler.
From this point on, we find a genuine old Maya song almost unaffected by
post-Conquest influences.

<span id="fn_443"></span>[115:1](cbc17.htm#fr_445) A tender boy, Maya,
*munal*. "Mun: something tender and unmatured, before it ripens, like
fruit and young boys." Motul. Possibly *mun nal* is intended and the
young maize plant or ear is meant.

<span id="fn_444"></span>[115:2](cbc17.htm#fr_446) Alternative
translation: the lord of the katun (*u tah katun*).

<span id="fn_445"></span>[115:3](cbc17.htm#fr_447) *Ayano*, an old
Toltec interjection of sorrow.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[115:4](cbc17.htm#fr_448) We have seen
idolators referred to as "heretics" on page [79](cbc08.htm#page_79).
Here we have a reference to an old legend related to the first Spanish
settlers, probably by Gaspar Antonio. "It is told that the first
inhabitants of Chichen Itzá were not idolators until Kukulcan, a Mexican
captain, entered these provinces. He taught idolatry, as they say it was
he who taught them." Relaciones de Yucatan, I, p. 270. This would be in
the Tenth Century A.D. *Cf.* prophecy on p. 161. The story is hardly to
be taken literally and probably refers to a change in the religion of
Yucatan and the introduction of the Quetzalcoatl cult.

<span id="fn_447"></span>[115:5](cbc17.htm#fr_449) The translator
believes this to be another old Toltec interjection.

<span id="fn_448"></span>[115:6](cbc17.htm#fr_450) Lit. West-well,
perhaps the modern Chikin¢onot southwest of Valladolid, but more likely
some locality near Chic~~h~~en Itzá.

<span id="fn_449"></span>[115:7](cbc17.htm#fr_451) We find in the
prophecies a reference to certain tribute being buried or hidden at
Chic~~h~~en Itzá in a Katun 4 Ahau which probably occurred in the Tenth
Century A.D. (Tizimin p. 28). Perhaps, however, merely the planted corn
is meant here.

<span id="fn_450"></span>[115:8](cbc17.htm#fr_452) The next two words,
*thunci yaue*, are not translated. They appear to mean: after something
was spattered. *Yaue* is probably a mistake of the compiler.

<span id="fn_451"></span>[115:9](cbc17.htm#fr_453) According to the Mani
and Tizimin Chronicles the conquest of Chichen by the Itzá in Katun 4
Ahau was their second occupation of the city.

<span id="fn_452"></span>[115:10](cbc17.htm#fr_454) Lit. the day of the
god. *Cf.* Motul.

<span id="fn_453"></span>[115:11](cbc17.htm#fr_455) In the
katun-prophecies we shall see the Itzá referred to as enemies. This
third triumph may refer to the conquest by Hunac Ceel.

<span id="fn_454"></span>[115:12](cbc17.htm#fr_456) *Uuiyao*: probably
an interjection. It might mean hunger or famine.

<span id="fn_455"></span>[115:13](cbc17.htm#fr_457) Maya, *Oxte caan u
kin*. Probably a chronological statement, referring to the position of
the sun at the time. The sky was divided into thirteen layers or
heavens, *Oxlahuncaan* (lit. thirteenth heaven or thirteen heavens) was
the full moon. Motul.

<span id="fn_456"></span>[115:14](cbc17.htm#fr_458) Maya, *tan yol
uinice*. Lit. in the midst of men. *Tan yol che* means in the forest,
i.e. in the midst of the trees.

<span id="fn_457"></span>[115:15](cbc17.htm#fr_459) Maya, *Cen u mac
lee*. This may be an error of the compiler.

<span id="fn_458"></span>[115:16](cbc17.htm#fr_460) Putun is a
geographical term and refers to the people living near Laguna de
Términos, in the ancient Province of Tixchel. There is also a town named
Tixchel, where the people "speak a different language called
*Putun-than*, otherwise named *Chontal*, although in many words it is
close to the Maya, so that if one is known, the other is easily learned"
(Ciudad Real 1873, II, p. 452). A study of the language is found in Blom
& LaFarge 1927, II, p. 465. Possibly *putun* is also a Maya word. The
translator recalls hearing of a variety of chile called *putun-ic*.

<span id="fn_459"></span>[116:1](cbc17.htm#fr_461) Possibly one of the
conquerors associated with Hunac Ceel. *Cf.* [p. 74](cbc07.htm#page_74).
Alternative translation: We were your companions, Mizcit Ahau.

<span id="fn_460"></span>[116:2](cbc17.htm#fr_462) Alternative
translation: I abhorred my song.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[116:3](cbc17.htm#fr_463) Possibly a reference
to human sacrifice.

<span id="fn_462"></span>[116:4](cbc17.htm#fr_464) Except, perhaps, for
some of the prophecies which may have been sung, we have here a unique
example of the old songs of the Maya. It was probably little understood
in the Eighteenth Century when the Chumayel was compiled. The repeated
refrain, *Antan hereyao*, here translated as "heresy was favored," is
likely to be the distortion of some old Toltec chant.
