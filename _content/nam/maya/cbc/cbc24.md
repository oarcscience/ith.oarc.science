### Footnotes

<span id="fn_639"></span>[135:1](cbc24.htm#fr_642) The following three
chronicles have been dependably translated by Brinton and Martinez
(Brinton 1882; Martinez 1912, 1927). If the present translator has
ventured to disagree with them in some particulars, it is because new
material has come to light.

<span id="fn_640"></span>[135:2](cbc24.htm#fr_643) The katun consisted
of twenty tuns of 360 days each, making 7200 days in all, and was named
for the day Ahau on which it ended.

<span id="fn_641"></span>[135:3](cbc24.htm#fr_644) Fifty years ago
Brinton translated this sentence: "The thirteenth ahau; Pop was set in
order." He admits that he was at a loss for the exact bearing of the
expression, but since Pop was the name of the first month in the Maya
year, he concludes that this is a record of the adoption of the Maya
calendar at that time (Brinton 1882, p. 150). Later it was thought that
this statement recorded a calendrical change of some sort. But although
Pop, the name of the first month of the year, means mat, we have seen on
page 72 of the present work that there was also a mat of the katun and
that it was "counted in order." (See page 72, note
 [13](cbc07.htm#fn_115).) Here we have the actual count, and it seems
obvious that it is the so-called mat of the katun which was counted in
order in this case. Moreover Katun 13 Ahau is the last of the recurring
series of 13 katuns, and it would be the time to make a count of the
preceding katun-markers of this period, now that it had elapsed. The
following day is 1 Imix, the day with which Landa tells us the Maya
calendar began, and the first day of the new series. Further mention of
the mat of the katun will be found on page 165. *Cf.* Roys 1922, p. 52,
and Dieseldorff 1931, p. 31.

<span id="fn_642"></span>[135:4](cbc24.htm#fr_645) The long gaps in
these chronicles, sometimes covering more than two centuries, are
puzzling. Besides the so-called second Chumayel chronicle which is
really a historical folk-song, there are four which have come down to
us, and they are uniform in the two following particulars. All four end
about the second decade of the Seventeenth Century and none of them take
on the character of a genuine chronicle except for the period following
the destruction of Mayapan, which occurred about the middle of the
Fifteenth Century. Subsequent to that event the entries are fairly
frequent, but during the thousand years prior to that date, a period
which the Mani, Tizimin and first Chumayel chronicles purport to cover,
the historical entries are few and far between. The most likely
conclusion to be drawn from these circumstances is that for the long
period before the fall of Mayapan our chronicles are compilations or
reconstructions made by early Seventeenth Century Maya writers from the
historical allusions contained in the katun-prophecies and the old
folk-songs, supplemented no doubt by a certain amount of oral tradition.
That the Maya once had genuine chronicles written in hieroglyphic
characters, there is little doubt, as has been demonstrated by Carrillo
y Ancona (1872, p. 563); and it is probable that some of these were
composed in much the same form as the chronicles of the Books of Chilam
Balam, only with more numerous entries.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[136:1](cbc24.htm#fr_646) Possibly the
reference is to the folds of the screen-like book in which the katuns
were recorded, or else to thirteen turns of the katun-wheel.

<span id="fn_644"></span>[136:2](cbc24.htm#fr_647) Chakanputun is
generally supposed to have been the modern Champoton in Southwestern
Yucatan. The latter name is substituted for Chakanputun on page 75 of
the Codex Perez.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[136:3](cbc24.htm#fr_648) Katun 8 Ahau recurred
approximately every 256 years, and for a thousand years every time a
katun of this name occurred, the Itzá were driven from their homes, no
matter where they were living at the time. Late in the Seventh Century
A.D. they were expelled from Chichen Itzá after their first occupation
of that city. In the middle of the Ninth Century they were driven out of
Chakanputun. At the end of the Twelfth Century they were again driven
from Chichen Itzá by Hunac Ceel. About the middle of the Fifteenth
Century Mayapan was sacked and destroyed; and strangely enough it was
again in a Katun 8 Ahau at the end of the Seventeenth Century that the
Spaniards conquered the last Itzá stronghold at Tayasal, which was the
end of this remarkable nation.

<span id="fn_646"></span>[137:1](cbc24.htm#fr_649) Maya, *keban-than*,
variously defined as treachery, treason, plot, conspiracy, to accuse
falsely and to slander. Hence the Itzá may have been driven out because
of some false accusation that Hunac Ceel made concerning them.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[137:2](cbc24.htm#fr_650) Maya, *uahaluah*,
literally an occasion when there is an abundance of bread for everyone.
Brinton's translation of the term as a banquet seems appropriate, and it
accords with the Itzá legend of the wedding feast from which the bride
was stolen. *Cf.* Appendix C.

<span id="fn_648"></span>[137:3](cbc24.htm#fr_651) Here the Maya word,
Ah Itzmal, could be equally well translated as the ruler of Izamal.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[137:4](cbc24.htm#fr_652) Maya, *u ¢abal u
natob*. This a passive form of the expression, *¢a-naat*, which we find
on page 30, and which is applied to the questionnaire of the chiefs in
Chapter IX. The primary meaning of naat is to understand something; and
the Motul dictionary also defines it as "to foretell by conjectures and
prophecy in this manner," although the translator has not found the
expression employed in this sense in any Maya text.

<span id="fn_650"></span>[137:5](cbc24.htm#fr_653) There are a number of
references in Maya literature to the episode so briefly recorded here.
*Cf.* Appendix C.

<span id="fn_651"></span>[137:6](cbc24.htm#fr_654) lch-paa, literally:
within the walls.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[137:7](cbc24.htm#fr_655) Evidently the Itzá
were able to regain their power forty years after the great disaster.

<span id="fn_653"></span>[137:8](cbc24.htm#fr_656) Katun 8 Ahau ended
1457-1460. The reference is to the well-known destruction of the capital
in which the Cocom and Xiu families had long governed the rest of the
country. The Xius, whose power had been inferior to that of the Cocoms,
organized a conspiracy among the subject chiefs, killed most of the
Cocom family and destroyed the city. Subsequently northern Yucatan was
divided among a number of petty states. *Cf.* Landa, 1928, p. 82.

<span id="fn_654"></span>[138:1](cbc24.htm#fr_657) Maya, *oc-na-kuchil*.
This expression is a stereotyped one employed as a synonym for
pestilence.

<span id="fn_655"></span>[138:2](cbc24.htm#fr_658) The Maya term,
*ich-paa*, was one of the names for Mayapan, but that city was now
destroyed.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[138:3](cbc24.htm#fr_659) The episode referred
to was the murder of the "rain-bringer" Napot Xiu, halach-uinic of Mani,
by Nachi Cocom at a town called Otzmal in the latter's territory.
Following a severe drought Napot Xiu started on a pilgrimage to the
Sacrificial Cenote at Chichen Itzá to make an offering of human victims
to the rain-god. Being obliged to pass through Nachi Cocom's territory,
the pilgrims stopped at Otzmal where they were entertained and
subsequently murdered by the Cocom ruler. *Cf.* Morley 1920, page 478;
Landa 1928, page 114. Here the chronology of the event is badly
confused. It occurred in 1536 in a year 8 Cauac, while the year 4 Kan
cited here began in 1545. We can only conclude that our Maya historian
confused the time of the Otzmal murder with some similar occurrence
which took place in the latter year. The number 158 appears to be an
error of the Maya compiler.

One phrase left untranslated here, *he tun te na cici pahool*, is
rendered by Martinez as follows: "*cesó de llevarse la cuenta del katun
de los anos*;"

<span id="fn_657"></span>[138:4](cbc24.htm#fr_660) The present writer
has followed the translation given here by both Brinton and Martinez,
but the Maya expression *y-ah-talzah-ul* simply means "those who brought
something or someone." *Cf.* San Buenaventura 1888, f. 27 v. As
previously noted, an epidemic of smallpox swept through Yucatan in Katun
2 Ahau, and it may have been brought by the party of Spaniards who were
shipwrecked and cast on the east coast in 1511 (Landa 1928, p. 34). The
Tizimin chronicle states that white men first came in tun 13 of Katun 2
Ahau (Martinez 1927, p. 17).

<span id="fn_658"></span>[138:5](cbc24.htm#fr_661) This date recalls the
statement on page [81](cbc10.htm#page_81) that the Spaniards seized
Campeche in 1513.

<span id="fn_659"></span>[138:6](cbc24.htm#fr_662) Katun 9 Ahau covered
approximately the twenty years following 1556 or 1559, according to
which of the two chronological correlations we accept. It was in this
katun that the conversion of the country took place, although efforts in
this direction began a decade previously. Bishop Toral arrived in 1562.
The hangings referred to here were probably the result of the Indian
uprising of 1546 in the region of Valladolid.

<span id="fn_660"></span>[138:7](cbc24.htm#fr_663) Landa died on April
29, 1579.
