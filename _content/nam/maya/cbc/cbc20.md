### (THE PROPHECY OF CHILAM BALAM AND THE STORY OF ANTONIO MARTINEZ <span id="fr_494"></span>[4](#fn_492))

&lt;Let it be known that the day then arrived&gt; <span
id="fr_495"></span>[5](#fn_493) when the tenth katun <span
id="fr_496"></span>[6](#fn_494) was

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

established, when the katun of the Plumeria flower was
established. <span id="fr_497"></span>[1](#fn_495) For three moons <span
id="fr_498"></span>[2](#fn_496) had been established
Yuma-une-tziuit, <span id="fr_499"></span>[3](#fn_497) the quetzal, the
green bird. <span id="fr_500"></span>[4](#fn_498) Then there shall be
present the forceful one, <span id="fr_501"></span>[5](#fn_499) there
would be Nine Mountains, <span id="fr_502"></span>[6](#fn_500)
Yuma-une-tziuit, the quetzal, the green bird. No one understands the
penance among the rulers <span id="fr_503"></span>[7](#fn_501) in the
twelfth tun when he declared his name. &lt;Like&gt; a jaguar is his
head, long is his tooth, <span id="fr_504"></span>[8](#fn_502)
withered <span id="fr_505"></span>[9](#fn_503) is his body, &lt;like&gt;
a dog <span id="fr_506"></span>[10](#fn_504) is his body. His heart is
pierced with sorrow. <span id="fr_507"></span>[11](#fn_505) Sweet is his
food, sweet is his drink. Perchance he does not speak, <span
id="fr_508"></span>[12](#fn_506) perchance he will not hear. They say
his speech is false and mad. <span id="fr_509"></span>[13](#fn_507)
Nowhere do the younger sisters, native

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

to the land, surrender themselves. They shall be taken away from the
land here. So it shall always be with the maidens, the daughters whom
they shall bear tomorrow and day after tomorrow. Give yourselves up, my
younger brothers, my older brothers, submit <span
id="fr_510"></span>[1](#fn_508) to the unhappy destiny of the katun
which is to come. If you do not submit, you shall be moved from where
your feet are rooted. <span id="fr_511"></span>[2](#fn_509) If you do
not submit, you shall gnaw the trunks of trees and herbs. <span
id="fr_512"></span>[3](#fn_510) If you do not submit, it shall be as
when the deer die, <span id="fr_513"></span>[4](#fn_511) so that they go
forth from your settlement. Then &lt;even&gt; when the ruler &lt;himself
&gt; goes forth, he shall return within your settlement bearing
nothing. <span id="fr_514"></span>[5](#fn_512) Also there shall come
&lt;such a pestilence that&gt; the vultures enter the houses, <span
id="fr_515"></span>[6](#fn_513) a time of great death among the wild
animals. <span id="fr_516"></span>[7](#fn_514) There shall be three
kinds of bread, &lt;the bread-nut <span id="fr_517"></span>[8](#fn_515)
shall be their bread&gt; in the katun of the Plumeria flower. Then
&lt;comes the time&gt; <span id="fr_518"></span>[9](#fn_516) when
thirteen layers of mats are laid down for the very mad one, <span
id="fr_519"></span>[10](#fn_517) for the adulterer. Then comes the
&lt;papal&gt; bull <span id="fr_520"></span>[11](#fn_518) of six
divisions. Three times the bull shall be announced. Then the judge of
the bull shall come, when he &lt;who bears&gt; the gold staff <span
id="fr_521"></span>[12](#fn_519) shall judge, when white wax
&lt;candles&gt; <span id="fr_522"></span>[13](#fn_520) shall be
exchanged. /

|          |

It is to be white wax, when justice shall descend from Heaven, for
Christian men to come up before the eye of justice. <span
id="fr_523"></span>[14](#fn_521) Then it shall shake heaven and earth.
In sorrow shall end the katun of the Plumeria flower. No one shall
fulfil his promises. The prop-roots of the trees shall be bent
over. <span id="fr_524"></span>[15](#fn_522) There shall be an
earthquake all over the land. The fulfilment

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

of the prophecy of the katun of the Plumeria flower shall be for
sale. <span id="fr_525"></span>[1](#fn_523) There is no reason or
necessity for you to submit <span id="fr_526"></span>[2](#fn_524) to the
Archbishop. When he comes, you shall go and hide yourselves in the
forest. If you surrender yourselves, you shall follow Christ, when he
shall come. Then his visitation <span id="fr_527"></span>[3](#fn_525)
shall end. Then shall come to pass the shaking <span
id="fr_528"></span>[4](#fn_526) of the Plumeria flower. Then you shall
understand. Then it shall thunder from a dry sky. Then shall be spoken
that which is written on the wall. Then you shall set up God, <span
id="fr_529"></span>[5](#fn_527) that is, you shall admit his divinity to
your hearts. I hardly know what wise man among you will understand. He
who understands will go into the forest to serve Christianity. Who will
understand it?

After only fourteen years <span id="fr_530"></span>[6](#fn_528) of
chieftainship, permanently the Son <span id="fr_531"></span>[7](#fn_529)
shall arrive, Don Antonio Martínez <span id="fr_532"></span>[8](#fn_530)
and Saul. These were his names when he departed from heaven. At that
time he went to Tzimentan, <span id="fr_533"></span>[9](#fn_531) and
when he was at Tzimentan a certain queen said she would marry him. For
seven years he was married, when the golden doors of the house of four
apartments <span id="fr_534"></span>[10](#fn_532) were opened.
&lt;Here&gt;he was shown how, and he equipped <span
id="fr_535"></span>[11](#fn_533) a fleet of thirteen ships. Then he
began a war with the land of Havana. <span
id="fr_536"></span>[12](#fn_534) The King <span
id="fr_537"></span>[13](#fn_535) had a friend at Havana, and the King
was advised by his friend. The public prosecutor was there with him.
Then he went and heard that &lt;the man&gt; was to be seized. Whereupon
he departed and went to Tzimentan. It was three months after he was
seized that the man who took him departed. Then he arrived at Tzimentan.
When &lt;the man&gt; was seized, /

|          |
|----------|
| p\. 66 C |

he cut short the words of him who took him when he arrived at Tzimentan,
and he said: "Go, man." These were his

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

words to him. "It is three months &lt;since&gt; I arrived," he said. "It
is three months, now, &lt;since&gt; you departed. It was three months
&lt;ago&gt; that you arrived, since you arrived, since you are shut up
in the prison; in the meantime I come. I will take you out of prison.
You two captains shall follow me." he said.

"Let nine chairs be raised up for us to sit on. <span
id="fr_538"></span>[1](#fn_536) The sea shall burn. I shall be raised
up." There was fire in his eye. Sand and spray shall be raised aloft.
The face of the sun shall be darkened by the great tempest. Whereupon
the captain accoutered himself. &lt;Everything&gt; shall be blown to the
ground by the wind. In the meantime I sit on my chair; in the meantime
the fleet of thirteen ships comes. Then the King <span
id="fr_539"></span>[2](#fn_537) accouters himself also. "Prepare
yourself, my lord! There come the French." These were his words to me.
"We shall be killed by &lt;these&gt; men. For what reason does your
strength fail because of your compatriots? Let me go and direct the ship
from the middle." My own spirits are raised also. The sea upon which I
go burns. The face of the heavens is tilted. But when I came down into
his presence, the ship was lost. <span id="fr_540"></span>[3](#fn_538)
"What man are you?" he said to me. "I am without compunction. <span
id="fr_541"></span>[4](#fn_539) It is I whom you have aided, <span
id="fr_542"></span>[5](#fn_540) I am he whom you have caused to live
again." <span id="fr_543"></span>[6](#fn_541) &lt;Then he
said:&gt; <span id="fr_544"></span>[7](#fn_542) "I shall put my name to
the test, it is Martinez. God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy
Spirit is my name." &lt;These were his words.&gt; <span
id="fr_545"></span>[8](#fn_543)Then I brought out the book of seven
generations to read. <span id="fr_546"></span>[9](#fn_544) In three
months it was finished.

Now the town officials went elsewhere. <span
id="fr_547"></span>[10](#fn_545) Whereupon he said he would give his
town, half of the men &lt;in it&gt;, to me. "Where is your town? It is
all my town," &lt;he said&gt;. <span id="fr_548"></span>[11](#fn_546)
"You shall pay for my town, I was the first to arrive." <span
id="fr_549"></span>[12](#fn_547)

Then, I tell you, justice shall descend to the end that Christianity and
salvation may arise. Thus shall end the men of the Plumeria
flower. <span id="fr_550"></span>[13](#fn_548) Then the rulers of the
towns shall be asked for their proofs and titles of ownership, if they
know of them. Then they shall come forth from the forests and from

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

among the rocks and live like men; then towns shall be established
&lt;again&gt;. There shall be no fox to bite them. <span
id="fr_551"></span>[1](#fn_549) This shall be in Katun 9 Ahau. <span
id="fr_552"></span>[2](#fn_550) Five years shall run until the end of my
prophecy, and then shall come the time for the tribute to come down.
Then there shall be an end to the paying for the wars which our fathers
raised &lt;against the Spaniards&gt;. You shall not call the katun which
is to come a hostile one, when /

|          |
|----------|
| p\. 67 C |

Jesus Christ, the guardian of our souls, shall come. Just as &lt;we are
saved&gt; here on earth, so shall he bear our souls to his holy heaven
also. You are sons of the true God. Amen.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_492"></span>[120:4](cbc20.htm#fr_494) The following
combined prophecy and narrative in the Chumayel is immediately joined to
and made a part of the chronicle contained in the previous chapter,
following the statement that a certain epidemic occurred in the year
1692.

Two parallel versions of the material contained in the present chapter
are found in the Tizimin (pp. 14-16) and Mani (pp. 109-116) manuscripts.
The fullest account is that of the Mani, but the Tizimin version is
probably the oldest, as it retains the Maya forms of a number of words
which are translated into Spanish in the Mani and Chumayel. Both the
Tizimin and Mani versions contain an explanatory introduction which is
completely lacking in the Chumayel.

The Mani version bears the following title: *U than hahal ku tu nathob
Chilam*, which could be translated: The words of the true God which
Chilam understood. The introduction states that the other great Maya
prophets (see Appendix D) assembled at the house of Chilam Balam, here
also called Ah Nacom Balam and indicating that he was the official
sacrificial priest (Landa 1928, p. 194). Chilam Balam lay stretched out
in a trance in his room, while he received a revelation which seems to
have descended from the roof of the house, and which only he understood.
Finally all the others threw themselves on their faces, and Chilam Balam
is said to have delivered the prophecy contained in this chapter.

In this prophecy we find inserted bodily the story of a certain Antonio
Martinez, an adventurer who [probably](errata.htm#1) lived long after
the Spanish Conquest. His name does not appear in any of the Spanish
histories of Yucatan. A portion of the actual prophecy evidently dates
from ancient times and is written in very obscure language, while other
passages are inspired by events which occurred after the Spanish
occupation.

<span id="fn_493"></span>[120:5](cbc20.htm#fr_495) Supplied from the
Tizimin and Mani version of this prophecy.

<span id="fn_494"></span>[120:6](cbc20.htm#fr_496) In the Tizimin and
Mani versions it is called "the first katun." Katun 11 Ahau is usually
called the first katun. (*Cf.* [p. 147](cbc27.htm#page_147).) Not only
was it the first katun of the Spanish occupation, but it also began with
the day 1 Imix which was the first day of the tzol-kin, or tonalamatl.
Possibly it is here called the tenth katun because the Eighteenth
Century Maya copyist found it recorded immediately after the date 1692.
According to several Eighteenth Century Maya writers a Katun 10 Ahau
should have ended in 1692, but their deduction is not supported by the
historical evidence (Tizimin, p. 1; Mani, p. 135; cf. Seler 1902, pp.
591-592).

<span id="fn_495"></span>[121:1](cbc20.htm#fr_497) The erotic
significance of the Plumeria flower has already been discussed (p. 104,
note  [15](cbc15.htm#fn_360)). But that this eroticism was always sinful
may be doubted, for it was associated with lawful marriage and with the
father and mother of Nohochacyum, the head of the Lacandon Pantheon.
Furthermore the corollas of this flower are strung in chains and still
used as decorations in churches, a custom which probably dates from
ancient times (Standley 1930, p. 384). Consequently it may be inferred
that many of its associations were innocent and simply concerned the
reproduction of the race. Nevertheless, it may have been associated with
Kukulcan because of the introduction of certain erotic religious
practises by the Toltecs, and with the coming of the Spaniards on
account of the manner in which European soldiers of the Sixteenth
Century usually behaved toward the women of a newly conquered
population. Maya warriors probably carried off women captives to make
slaves and concubines of them, but it is doubtful that they practised
violation in warfare. Compare with the prophecy for Katun 7 Ahau, [p.
151](cbc27.htm#page_151).

<span id="fn_496"></span>[121:2](cbc20.htm#fr_498) Maya *uu*. This
refers to an actual lunation, and not to the Maya month of 20 days which
was called *uinal*.

<span id="fn_497"></span>[121:3](cbc20.htm#fr_499) This name is not
Maya. The division made here is in accordance with the Maya texts. Its
usual association with the quetzal leads to the conclusion that it is
closely connected with Kukulcan and may be another name for the Mexican
culture-hero.

<span id="fn_498"></span>[121:4](cbc20.htm#fr_500) The quetzal, the
green bird, Maya *kuk yaxum*. For *yaxum* see p. 63, note
 [6](cbc06.htm#fn_33). *Kuk* usually means a sprout or shoot, hence
offspring or descendants (Motul). Here we believe it refers to the
quetzal, which is also called *kùk* in Kekchi and *xman k'uk* in Chol
(Sapper 1927, p. 428). The Maya word for feather is *kukum*; but it is
very possible that the name, Kukul-can, is derived directly from *kuk*,
quetzal, and *can*, serpent, making it a literal translation of the
Nahuatl Quetzalcoatl.

<span id="fn_499"></span>[121:5](cbc20.htm#fr_501) The translator can
make little out of the Maya expression found here in the Chumayel, *u
may chiiceh*. *May* can mean either hoof or a fine powder, and *chiich*
means forcefully. The variant found in the Mani version of this passage,
*ah chich* is quite intelligible and means "the forceful one."

<span id="fn_500"></span>[121:6](cbc20.htm#fr_502) Nine Mountains, Maya,
*Bolonte uitz*. One of the Chumayel chronicles (p. 139) gives this place
as the origin of one of the groups of people who later settled in
Yucatan, probably the Itzá. *Cf.* p. 64, note 3.

<span id="fn_501"></span>[121:7](cbc20.htm#fr_503) If some of the most
powerful families of Yucatan, like the Xius, were of foreign origin,
they would have penances and other religious practises not understood by
the ordinary people. *Cf.* Appendix E.

<span id="fn_502"></span>[121:8](cbc20.htm#fr_504) The Maya *coo* can
mean either the tooth of an animal or man, or the bill of a bird.

<span id="fn_503"></span>[121:9](cbc20.htm#fr_505) The various Maya
compilers of the Books of Chilam Balam appear to have been uncertain
about this passage. The Chumayel text reads *¢u¢ul* which means withered
or shriveled; the Mani version gives *thul* which could be translated:
"like a rabbit;" while the Tizimin variant is *tzutzui* which means
dove. Among the Mexicans Quetzalcoatl was pictured as having a face not
altogether human.

<span id="fn_504"></span>[121:10](cbc20.htm#fr_506) The Tizimin version
is "disgusting is his body."

<span id="fn_505"></span>[121:11](cbc20.htm#fr_507) Both the Mani and
Tizimin versions read: "His heart is pierced by a dart."

<span id="fn_506"></span>[121:12](cbc20.htm#fr_508) Supplied from the
Tizimin version.

<span id="fn_507"></span>[121:13](cbc20.htm#fr_509) Alternative
translation: false and lewd.

<span id="fn_508"></span>[122:1](cbc20.htm#fr_510) Literally, make way,
etc.

<span id="fn_509"></span>[122:2](cbc20.htm#fr_511) The missionaries
caused much suffering by forcibly moving country people from their homes
and collecting them in towns to facilitate their conversion to
Christianity (Relaciones de Yucatan, II, p. 68).

<span id="fn_510"></span>[122:3](cbc20.htm#fr_512) Many people fled to
the forests to escape from the missionaries and Spanish officials
(Cogolludo 1868, Book 10, Chap. 2).

<span id="fn_511"></span>[122:4](cbc20.htm#fr_513) Maya *cim-cehil*,
when the deer die, i.e. when there is such a severe drought that the
water holes in the rocks dry up and the deer die of thirst. *Cf.*
Tizimin version.

<span id="fn_512"></span>[122:5](cbc20.htm#fr_514) In times of famine,
practically always the result of drought, people of the affected area
would leave their villages and wander about the country to exchange
their personal property for food. We may infer from this passage that
when the chief was obliged to do this, the situation was exceptionally
serious.

<span id="fn_513"></span>[122:6](cbc20.htm#fr_515) Maya, *oc-na-kuchil*.
*Cf.* Brinton 1882, p. 151.

<span id="fn_514"></span>[122:7](cbc20.htm#fr_516) It is difficult to
explain what is meant by this general mortality of wild animals. The
text indicates an epidemic.

<span id="fn_515"></span>[122:8](cbc20.htm#fr_517) Maya *ox*, *Brosimum
alicastrum* Sw., the *ramon* or bread-nut, the fruit of which was eaten
especially in time of famine. The second kind of bread would be maize,
and the third would be the *cup* (*Calopogonium cæruleum* Benth., or
jícama cimarrona) usually also mentioned in this connection. *Cf.* p.
103, notes  [10](cbc15.htm#fn_343) and  [11](cbc15.htm#fn_344).

<span id="fn_516"></span>[122:9](cbc20.htm#fr_518) Supplied from the
Tizimin and Mani versions.

<span id="fn_517"></span>[122:10](cbc20.htm#fr_519) Madness and
immorality are frequently associated in the Books of Chilam Balam.

<span id="fn_518"></span>[122:11](cbc20.htm#fr_520) The Spanish word,
*bula*, is employed in the Maya text.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[122:12](cbc20.htm#fr_521) This may be a
reference to the bishop's crozier.

<span id="fn_520"></span>[122:13](cbc20.htm#fr_522) Mediz Bolio (1930,
p. 75, note 147) considers this a reference to votive offerings of wax.

<span id="fn_521"></span>[122:14](cbc20.htm#fr_523) The Tizimin version
reads: "when the eye of justice shall sleep."

<span id="fn_522"></span>[122:15](cbc20.htm#fr_524) This may be the
result of the earthquake mentioned in the following sentence, but Mediz
Bolio suggests that a gallows is meant (1930, p. 76).

<span id="fn_523"></span>[123:1](cbc20.htm#fr_525) Possibly a reference
to the money paid for indulgences, which are compared here to the
prophecy of the Maya priests.

<span id="fn_524"></span>[123:2](cbc20.htm#fr_526) Literally: "to give
your heads to the Archbishop."

<span id="fn_525"></span>[123:3](cbc20.htm#fr_527) Written *visita* in
the text. The Tizimin version gives the Maya equivalent: "*Ca bin ¢oco¢
u thibah a uichil ex*."

<span id="fn_526"></span>[123:4](cbc20.htm#fr_528) Evidently a reference
to some ceremonial act, possibly the sprinkling of some consecrated
liquid.

<span id="fn_527"></span>[123:5](cbc20.htm#fr_529) Alternative
translation: declare his divinity.

<span id="fn_528"></span>[123:6](cbc20.htm#fr_530) Three and a half
katuns are mentioned in the Tizimin version and four katuns in the Mani.

<span id="fn_529"></span>[123:7](cbc20.htm#fr_531) Maya, *mehenbil*. The
Tizimin substitutes the word, *almehenil*, the nobleman.

<span id="fn_530"></span>[123:8](cbc20.htm#fr_532) The Spanish
historians do not mention this personage. There is an allusion in the
prophecy for Katun 1 Ahau (p. 158), which might place him some time
during the fifth and sixth decades of the Seventeenth Century. His other
name, Saul, is given as Xaul in the Tizimin and Mani versions.

<span id="fn_531"></span>[123:9](cbc20.htm#fr_533) We are unable to
identify this town. Mediz Bolio conjectures that it was some port on the
northeastern coast of Yucatan frequented by the Protestant buccaneers,
among whom were numbered the members of many strange sects (Mediz Bolio
1930, p. 77).

<span id="fn_532"></span>[123:10](cbc20.htm#fr_534) Probably a public
building, such as the church, as we read that the "town marriages" were
performed in the *can-kaz-na*, as it is called in Maya (Chumayel, [p.
159](cbc27.htm#page_159)). The idea of golden doors is a purely European
conception and may refer to the entrance to the chancel.

<span id="fn_533"></span>[123:11](cbc20.htm#fr_535) Maya, *tuz-zihzah*.
The Mani and Tizimin versions read *likzah* which could mean "raised a
fleet," etc.

<span id="fn_534"></span>[123:12](cbc20.htm#fr_536) Probably a piratical
raid on the coast of Cuba is meant.

<span id="fn_535"></span>[123:13](cbc20.htm#fr_537) Our text reads,
*Rey*, while the Tizimin gives its Maya equivalent, *ahau*.

<span id="fn_536"></span>[124:1](cbc20.htm#fr_538) Here the Chumayel
text is corrupt and the Mani version is followed for this sentence.

<span id="fn_537"></span>[124:2](cbc20.htm#fr_539) The text gives
"*Rey*," while the Tizimin version reads, "*nacom*," which means
captain. The Mani version reads: "Then the King agrees (*cetzicuba*)
also."

<span id="fn_538"></span>[124:3](cbc20.htm#fr_540) Corrected from the
Tizimin and Mani versions.

<span id="fn_539"></span>[124:4](cbc20.htm#fr_541) The Mani version
reads: "I am an infidel."

<span id="fn_540"></span>[124:5](cbc20.htm#fr_542) Alternative
translation: I, whom you have released. The Tizimin and Mani versions
read: "I, whom you have taken."

<span id="fn_541"></span>[124:6](cbc20.htm#fr_543) In a figurative sense
this also means: I am he whom you have baptised.

<span id="fn_542"></span>[124:7](cbc20.htm#fr_544) Supplied from the
Tizimin and Mani versions.

<span id="fn_543"></span>[124:8](cbc20.htm#fr_545) Supplied from the
Mani version.

<span id="fn_544"></span>[124:9](cbc20.htm#fr_546) Here the Tizimin and
Mani versions read: "Then he brought out the book of seven generations
for the priests to read." Martinez suggests it was a book of seven
folios.

<span id="fn_545"></span>[124:10](cbc20.htm#fr_547) Alternative
translation: Now the town officials surrendered.

<span id="fn_546"></span>[124:11](cbc20.htm#fr_548) Supplied from the
Tizimin and Mani versions.

<span id="fn_547"></span>[124:12](cbc20.htm#fr_549) The Tizimin and Mani
