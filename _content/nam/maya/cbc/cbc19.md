### (A HISTORY OF THE SPANISH CONQUEST)

This is the name of the year when the foreigners arrived, the year One
thousand five hundred and nineteen. This was the year when the
foreigners arrived here at our town, &lt;the town&gt; of us, the Itzá,
here in the land of Yucalpeten, <span id="fr_483"></span>[2](#fn_481)
Yucatan, in the speech of the Maya Itzá.

So said the first Adelantado; Don Juan de Montejo, <span
id="fr_484"></span>[3](#fn_482) because he was thus informed by Don
Lorenso Chable when he listened to this conqueror <span
id="fr_485"></span>[4](#fn_483) at Tixkokob. He received the foreigners
with all his heart. This was the reason they named him Don Lorenso
Chable, because he gave well-roasted meat to the foreigners and all the
captains. He had a son also named Don Martin Chable. <span
id="fr_486"></span>[5](#fn_484)

This is the year which was current when the foreigners prepared to seize
*Yucalpeten* <span id="fr_487"></span>[6](#fn_485) here. It was known by
the priest, the prophet, Ah Xupan, <span id="fr_488"></span>[7](#fn_486)
as he was called. Christianity was introduced to us in the year
1519. <span id="fr_489"></span>[8](#fn_487) The church at Merida was
founded in the year 1540. <span id="fr_490"></span>[9](#fn_488) In the
year 1599 the church at

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

Merida was completed. In the year 1648 yellow fever <span
id="fr_491"></span>[1](#fn_489) occurred and the sickness <span
id="fr_492"></span>[2](#fn_490) began &lt;to afflict&gt; us. /

There was death by famine for five years, 1650, 1651, 1652, 1653 and
1654. Then the famine ended. There was a hurricane which killed Father
Agustin Gomes in the year 1661. There was a drought in the year 1669.
&lt;The disease called&gt; *uzankak* <span
id="fr_493"></span>[3](#fn_491) occurred in 1692.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_481"></span>[119:2](cbc19.htm#fr_483) Yucalpeten is an
attempt to turn into Maya the name Yucatan given by the Spaniards. The
origin of the latter has been variously explained. The most plausible
account is that of Ah Naum Pech, a contemporary of the Conquest. He
states: "The Christian captains asked them in the Spanish language where
they lived. They did not comprehend and merely replied, 'We do not
understand what you say.' This they said, and &lt;the Spaniards&gt;
called it Yucatan. It was the Land of the Turkey, the Land of the Deer"
(Martinez 1926, p. 27).

<span id="fn_482"></span>[119:3](cbc19.htm#fr_484) Here again the son,
Don Juan, is confused with his father, Don Francisco de Montejo, who
conquered Yucatan.

<span id="fn_483"></span>[119:4](cbc19.htm#fr_485) The Maya allies of
the Spaniards who had assisted in the Conquest afterwards called
themselves "*conquistadores*" (Brinton 1882, p. 216). This was evidently
the priest, Ah Kin Chable, mentioned on page [86](cbc12.htm#page_86).
However, Montejo may be the conqueror referred to here.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[119:5](cbc19.htm#fr_486) The Chablé family of
Tixkokob does not appear to have lived up to expectations. Already in
1581 or thereabouts, Diego de Santillan, the husband of Doña Beatriz de
Montejo, writes of this town: "The governor of the said town of Tixkokob
is Lorenzo Puch from the town of San Cristóbal de los Naborios (a suburb
of Merida). For although the said town has a native chief, the
government of the said town has not been entrusted to him, as he is not
capable of it" (Relaciones de Yucatan, I, p. 281).

<span id="fn_485"></span>[119:6](cbc19.htm#fr_487) Yucalpeten, a Maya
imitation of the name Yucatan, has been translated as "the neck of the
land" (Molina Solís 1896, p. 168).

<span id="fn_486"></span>[119:7](cbc19.htm#fr_488) Ah Xupan, an early
Maya prophet. *Cf.* Tizimin [p. 13](cbc05.htm#page_13) and Appendix D.

<span id="fn_487"></span>[119:8](cbc19.htm#fr_489) Cortez exhorted the
Indians at Cozumel to accept Christianity and set up a cross for them in
1519 (Herrera 1725, Dec. 2, Book 2, Chap. 3).

<span id="fn_488"></span>[119:9](cbc19.htm#fr_490) Although Montejo
reached Merida in 1540, the Spanish city was not founded until early in
1542.

<span id="fn_489"></span>[120:1](cbc19.htm#fr_491) Maya *xe-kik*,
literally blood-vomit.

<span id="fn_490"></span>[120:2](cbc19.htm#fr_492) This was the famous
epidemic recorded in the French colony of Guadeloupe in this year. It
broke out in Campeche in June and lasted for the next two years. Molina
Solís 1910, p. 168. The Maya *cimil* can be translated as either
sickness or death.

<span id="fn_491"></span>[120:3](cbc19.htm#fr_493) *Uzankak* is a term
applied to both measles and scarlatina.
