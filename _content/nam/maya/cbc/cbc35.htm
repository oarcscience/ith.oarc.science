<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>In the prophetic literature of the Maya we find the names of certain animals mentioned in such manner as to suggest that they stand as the symbols for something else and that the reference is not to the actual animals. For example, we read: "There shall be no fox&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1042"></A><A HREF="#fn_1035"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to bite them,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1043"></A><A HREF="#fn_1036"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> "there shall be neither fox nor kinkajou that will bite,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1044"></A><A HREF="#fn_1037"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> "there shall be neither fox, puma nor weasel: there shall be none that bite. The claws of the puma shall be drawn; the claws of the jaguar shall be drawn."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1045"></A><A HREF="#fn_1038"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> "The time shall come when the burrowing opossum&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1046"></A><A HREF="#fn_1039"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and the jaguar&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1047"></A><A HREF="#fn_1040"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> shall bite one another."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1048"></A><A HREF="#fn_1041"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> At first sight it seems strange to find the comparatively harmless fox, kinkajou, weasel and opossum classed with the jaguar and puma.</P>
<P>We can not but suspect that these fauna-names are referable to certain persons and that the prophecies tell of a time when the people will be freed of the presence of these unwelcome individuals. Indeed, a further examination of the related material confirms this conjecture. In the Book of Chilam Balam of Tizimin we read: "At the time &lt;of the year&gt; 3 Kan the spots shall be removed from the red jaguars, the white jaguars.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1049"></A><A HREF="#fn_1042"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> The claws and teeth shall be drawn from the jaguars&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1050"></A><A HREF="#fn_1043"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> of the Itz&aacute;."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1051"></A><A HREF="#fn_1044"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A></P>
<P>We find further indications of the significance of these names of animals in the following passages: "There is no kinkajou, there is no fox, there is no weasel to suck men's blood; there are no pernicious rulers."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1052"></A><A HREF="#fn_1045"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> "The rulers shall be cut off, when the claws of the eagle&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1053"></A><A HREF="#fn_1046"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> are cut, when the backs of the kinkajou</P>

<P>and the fox are clawed and torn"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1054"></A><A HREF="#fn_1047"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> "Then the burrowing opossums who are greedy for dominion shall bite one another."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1055"></A><A HREF="#fn_1048"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> For Katun 12 Ahau, a period of good fortune, the prophecy states: "The burrowing opossum shall flee. He shall give up his delegated mat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1056"></A><A HREF="#fn_1049"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and throne, and he shall go out into the wilderness. Men shall be happy; things shall go well in the towns."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1057"></A><A HREF="#fn_1050"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> From this we infer that these animals represent certain persons in authority, and such a conclusion is amply confirmed by the following passage: "In the ninth year of Katun 6 Ahau the puma (<I>coh</I>) and the jaguar (<I>balam</I>) claw one another's backs. The puma (<I>coh</I>) is a <I>leon</I>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1058"></A><A HREF="#fn_1051"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> These are the head-chiefs (<I>halach-uinicob</I>)."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1059"></A><A HREF="#fn_1052"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></P>
<P>We have already seen how the central organization at Mayapan may be traced to a Toltec origin and followed to a certain extent the example of the Nahua institutions of the highlands of Mexico. It has also been noted that this foreign political structure was superimposed upon a form of local government that was probably indigenous.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1060"></A><A HREF="#fn_1053"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> We may therefore turn to the history of the Nahua peoples of Mexico for an explanation of some symbols connected with the higher ranks of the rulers in Yucatan.</P>
<P>Landa has given us to understand that with the exception of the Cocoms and Xius who ruled at Mayapan, the so-called "lords" possessed delegated powers only, and that it was only after the fall of that city that these <I>halach-uinics</I> became the real rulers of the various independent states into which the Spaniards found the country divided at the time of their arrival.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1061"></A><A HREF="#fn_1054"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> We have also noted in one of the prophecies just quoted that the "burrowing opossum" is to "give up his delegated mat and throne," or in other words, his authority. Consequently it seems permissible to draw an analogy between the <I>halach-uinics</I> symbolized by these animals and the <I>tecuhtli</I>, or so-called "lords," of the Nahua peoples of Mexico.</P>
<P>Seler has convincingly shown that the Mexican "king" delegated many of his functions to these men, and that the institution reached its highest development when the latter were set to supervising the collection of tribute and enforcing other rights which their own state had acquired over a conquered people.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1062"></A><A HREF="#fn_1055"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> Such would also be the case in Yucatan where the Toltec conquerors appear to have actually settled in the country and maintained their power for a long time in spite of the fact that they could never have formed more than a very small proportion of the population.</P>

<P>Seler goes on to quote from the unpublished Sahagun manuscript a list of mantles worn by persons of high rank in Mexico. A number of these are described as representing the skins of animals which we have seen mentioned in the Maya prophecies, such as the jaguar, kinkajou, puma, wild-cat and coyote.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1063"></A><A HREF="#fn_1056"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> From the same source and from the Mexican picture-manuscripts he gives descriptions and illustrations of warrior-costumes representing coyotes and jaguars.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1064"></A><A HREF="#fn_1057"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> He believes that what he calls "royal rank" among the Mexicans went back in the first instance to Quetzalcoatl and the Toltec dynasty,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1065"></A><A HREF="#fn_1058"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and we have already seen how Landa traces the authority of the "lords" of Yucatan back to the same source.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1066"></A><A HREF="#fn_1059"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></P>

<P>If we are right in ascribing a Mexican origin to a large part of the symbolism discussed here, it is to the architectural remains of the Toltec occupation of Yucatan that we should look for arch&aelig;ological confirmation. The jaguar, it is true, appears frequently in the older Maya art, indeed it goes back to some of the earliest monuments; but before the appearance of an intrusive Nahua culture in Yucatan this animal is always connected with the priesthood. Only in the Toltec temples do we begin to find it a symbol of the warrior class, as in the reliefs of the Temple of the Tigers and the platform just to the east of it at Chichen Itz&aacute;. It is in the reliefs and frescos of that masterpiece of Maya-Toltec architecture, the Temple of the Warriors, that we find the most striking illustration of the animals symbolizing the Nahua warrior-chieftains who once ruled over Yucatan. Many of them bear human hearts in their claws, suggesting that the warriors whom they represent captured victims for human</P>

Here we see the puma,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1068"></A><A HREF="#fn_1061"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the jaguar&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1069"></A><A HREF="#fn_1062"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the coyote or fox&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1070"></A><A HREF="#fn_1063"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and the eagle.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1071"></A><A HREF="#fn_1064"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></P>
<P>Although we have but little data on which to base an estimate of the age of the Toltec remains at Chichen Itz&aacute;, it seems probable that the political hegemony of this city preceded that of Mayapan.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1072"></A><A HREF="#fn_1065"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Consequently we can hardly expect too close a correspondence between the references in the Books of Chilam Balam and the sculptures at Chichen Itz&aacute;. The Maya writers of the Spanish colonial period would have a much more vivid recollection of the hegemony of Mayapan which ended about the middle of the Fifteenth Century.</P>
<P>Among the Mexicans the jaguar was the strong and brave animal par excellence, the companion of the eagle. Indeed "Eagle and Jaguar" was the conventional designation of brave warriors.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1073"></A><A HREF="#fn_1066"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> The coyote was regarded in a two-fold aspect. He was the god of singing and dancing, but as a beast of prey he was also a symbol of the warrior. Certain outstanding warriors appeared both at dances and in battle clothed in a garment representing the coyote.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1074"></A><A HREF="#fn_1067"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> If it seems a little strange to find the coyote serving as a symbol of bravery, we can not but feel that a considerable stretch of the imagination was required to consider the kinkajou in the same light. And yet such was the case. Whether alone, or associated with the hawk, the kinkajou was, next to the eagle and jaguar, regarded as one of the bravest and strongest animals and the symbol of the bold warrior.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1075"></A><A HREF="#fn_1068"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> "Hawk and Kinkajou" are often mentioned in the Mexican myths and stories along with the "Eagle and Jaguar."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1076"></A><A HREF="#fn_1069"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A></P>
<P>The weasel (Maya <I>zabin</I> or <I>sabim</I>) seems a more appropriate animal in this connection than either the coyote or kinkajou. Its association with ideas pertaining to military affairs is shown by certain expressions found in the Motul dictionary. "<I>Zabim-be, ah-zabim-be</I>: a look-out, sentinel and spy, when no battle-line has been formed; also to keep a look-out." "<I>Zabin-katun</I>: look-out</P>

<P>or sentinel, when the battle-line has been formed, and to keep a look-out in this manner." Literally, <I>zabim-be</I> means the weasel of the road and <I>zabin-katun</I>, the weasel of the army. No portrayal of this animal has yet been found and identified.</P>
<P>This leaves the so-called "burrowing opossum" to be accounted for. It must be confessed that neither in Maya nor Mexican art have we found the opossum playing the r&ocirc;le assigned to him in the Books of Chilam Balam. Frequently depicted in the Mexican picture-manuscripts, the animal appears as</P>

<P>The frequent mention of these various animals in the Books of Chilam. Balam is therefore of unusual interest. Although the meaning of the jaguars and eagles at Chichen Itz&aacute; has long been known, we should be tempted to ascribe a religious or mythological significance to the other animals found in the reliefs and frescos of that city, if it were not for the information contained in these manuscripts. As it is, they take on the character of historical and political figures.</P>

As the coyote would be known only from hearsay at Chichen Itz&aacute;, we might expect a less realistic treatment than in the case of other animals. Morris, Charlot and Morris, Plate 165.</P>
