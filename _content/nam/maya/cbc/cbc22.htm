<P>Strung end to end are the precious stones, the red precious stones, representing the substance of heaven, the moisture of heaven.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_612"></A><A HREF="#fn_609"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></P>
<P>The form in which you created the sun, &lt;in which&gt; you created the earth! The form of the moisture of heaven, the substance of heaven, the yellow blossom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_613"></A><A HREF="#fn_610"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of heaven! How did I create your sun? &lt;How did I&gt; create your moon? How did I create your precious stones? I created you. When you were sprinkled with water, you remembered the force of the sun. Then when the message was sent to you ... Under cover I created you, I set you &lt;where you are&gt;. From time to time I take &lt;you&gt;, I perceive your vigor because of your father. You await ... that I may take away ... from your mouth. They are the yellow precious stones. So runs its course as he records&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_614"></A><A HREF="#fn_611"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> it. These are the rulers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_615"></A><A HREF="#fn_612"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> which have been set in order. Go and read it and you will understand it.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_616"></A><A HREF="#fn_613"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></P>

<P><A NAME="fn_607"></A><A HREF="cbc21.htm#fr_610">131:1</A> The text reads <I>un trus nicte</I>. <I>Nicte</I> is a flower, usually the Plumeria. <I>Trus</I>, since it contains an r is probably a distorted Spanish word. The translation given here is derived from a comparison of the use of the expression on p. 118 of B.L.C. No. 43 and that of a similar Maya phrase, <I>oxlahun tzuc nicte</I> on page 174 of the same manuscript. The translator is inclined to associate this expression with the love-charm described by Aguilar (Aguilar 1892, p. 84; translated in Saville 1921, p. 207).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_608"></A><A HREF="cbc21.htm#fr_611">131:2</A> Maya, <I>pectzil</I>. This word usually means news or what is said of some one. Here something concrete appears to be intended, and the word has been divided into its component parts, <I>pec</I> and <I>tzil</I>, which give a very different meaning.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_609"></A><A HREF="cbc22.htm#fr_612">131:3</A> Maya: <I>kab caan itz caan</I>. When asked who he was, Itzamat-ul, a deified ruler of Izamal, replied: "<I>Itz en caan, itz en muyal</I>." This has been translated: "<I>Yo soy el roc&iacute;o, &oacute; sustancia del cielo y nubes</I>" (Cogolludo 1868, Book 4, chap. 8).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_610"></A><A HREF="cbc22.htm#fr_613">131:4</A> <I>Cf.</I> p. 65, note &nbsp;<A HREF="cbc06.htm#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_611"></A><A HREF="cbc22.htm#fr_614">131:5</A> To obtain this meaning <I>&#162;olic</I> (he skins it) has been changed to <I>tzolic</I> (he records it).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_612"></A><A HREF="cbc22.htm#fr_615">131:6</A> Ahau (ruler) is the day for which the katun is named.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_613"></A><A HREF="cbc22.htm#fr_616">131:7</A> This very difficult passage differs in vocabulary and style from the rest of the MS. The spaces left in the text indicate that the Eighteenth Century compiler copied it from a defective original. Its unique style resembles that of Gates' Ritual of the Bacabs, which was probably written in eastern Yucatan, judging from a comparison of the latter with the Titulos de Ebtun. The translator is familiar only with a few extracts from the Ritual of the Bacabs, but it is possible that the above passage has been copied from that manuscript. <I>Cf.</I> Tozzer 1921, p. 196. We suggest that this is an invocation to the growing corn. Possibly the last three sentences refer to the following chapter.</P>
