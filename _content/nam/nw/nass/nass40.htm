<P>A scabby slave girl appears on the street of a village. A prince marries her. When his mother feeds her, she puts into the empty dish a scab, which is transformed into an abalone shell. In the evening the girl's mother, Evening Sky, comes and announces that her people will come and give the prince much property. Next day they arrive. The prince and his people go inland to trade. His wife is angry because he does not take her along. She bathes the awkward brother of the prince, gives him red paint, and sends him to the inlanders to trade for weasel skins. He becomes beautiful and rich, and she marries him. Her mother comes again and brings much property, which she gives to her new husband.</P>
