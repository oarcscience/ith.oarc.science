# THE STONE AND THE ELDERBERRY BUSH

\[Told by Moses\]

A little before the Stone gave birth to her child, the Elderberry Bush
gave birth to her children. For that reason the Indians do not live many
years. Because the Elderberry Bush gave birth to her children first, man
dies quickly. If the Stone had first given birth to her children, this
would not be so. Thus say the Indians. That is the story of the
Elderberry Bush's children. The Indians are much troubled because the
Stone did not give birth to her children first, for this is the reason
that men die quickly.
