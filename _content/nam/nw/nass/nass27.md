### TXÄ'MSEM

Txä'msEm visits a chief who owns fresh water. He pretends that the chief
soiled his bed, and by threatening to tell on him he gets permission to
take a drink of water. He takes all the water and flies away. The water
runs out of his blanket and forms rivers. He meets the ghosts and turns
back, therefore the waters of Nass river turn back. He makes a gull
vomit olachen, then he rubs its spawn over his canoe and goes to a chief
who owns the olachen. He pretends to have caught many olachen, showing
the spawn in his canoe. The chief is annoyed and releases the olachen
from his house. Txä'msEm catches olachen and roasts them. Gulls steal
them. He throws the gulls into a fire and the tips of their wings become
black. He assumes the shape

of a deer, ties pitchwood to his tail, and steals fire. He strikes the
butts of the trees with his burning tail, and therefore the wood burns.
Txä'msEm then marries a salmon woman and thus obtains salmon. She makes
his hair grow long. He scolds her, and all the salmon and his long hair
disappear.
