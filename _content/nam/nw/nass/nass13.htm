<P ALIGN="CENTER">[Told by Moses]</P>
<P>There was a man who never slept in his house. He always lay at the edge of his smoke-hole. Therefore he grew exceedingly strong. When he went to gather firewood, he pulled out a whole tree and carried it home on his shoulder. In the evening, when he had eaten, he went up and lay down at the edge of the smoke-hole. Therefore his name was Smoke-hole. Nobody could carry what he was able to carry. He always carried firewood on his shoulders. He carried whole trees on his shoulders.</P>
