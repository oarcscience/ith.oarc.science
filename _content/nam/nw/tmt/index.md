This is a massive study of the myths and legends of the Tlingit, Native
Americans of southern Alaska. These texts include a lengthly cycle of
stories about Raven, the trickster figure of the Northwest, the
equivalent of the better known Coyote of the Southwest. Another major
thread that runs through these stories is the typical Northwestern
preoccupation with wealth and status. The land was abundant with marine
life, wildlife and other resources. The Tlingit, along with other
cultures in the region, had developed a very high level of material
wealth, as well as levels of social inequality not found elsewhere in
North America. For this reason, many of the stories are parallel to
European folklore (without being derivative in the slightest way), in
which a low-status person achieves wealth and respect by supernatural
intervention or a series of epic trials.

On the other hand, the Tlingit were also avid believers in the Potlatch
system, by which wealth was distributed by the rich at festivals, in
order to reinforce their status. Hence there are also stories in this
collection in which altruism and sharing wealth are rewarded.

Usually in 19th century ethnographies the texts are presented without
any clue as to the cultural context in which they were told. This
collection diverges from this sometimes maddening practice. The function
of stories is often described in an footnote by the informant, for
instance, as fables for young people. In another instance at the end of
the book the myth cycle is retold, [woven into a grieving
ceremony](tmt133).
