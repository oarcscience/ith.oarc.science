<P>Now all the people were very happy because the salmon were running, but before they had left the town Raven came to them and said, "Don't leave the town. Stay right here. Don't go to any of the salmon creeks." They were very hungry for salmon, however, and said to four boys, "Go to the salmon creek close by and get some salmon for the village." So they went there and filled their canoe.</P>
<P>This salmon stream runs down into a sort of lake, and, while they were upon this paddling homeward, they heard some one calling to them. Presently a man came down through the woods and shouted, "Stay where you are, and I will tell you something." Looking at this man, they saw that he was naked and painted red all over.

It is what the shaman sees that kills him.' It has happened just as he said. And he said to me, 'The fellow in the stern will got home and have something to eat. Just as soon as he has eaten he will drop over.'" And so it happened. Just as soon as he had told the story he dropped over dead.
