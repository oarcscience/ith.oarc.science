<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">12. THE WOMAN WHO WAS KILLED BY A CLAM</H3>
<P>There was a famine at a certain town and many people had to depend on shellfish, so the women went down to the beach at low tide every day to gather them. One time a chief's daughter went down and reached far under a rock to find some clams. Then a large bivalve called x&icirc;t closed upon her hand, holding her prisoner. Presently the tide began to rise, and, when it had almost reached her, she began singing a song about herself. She kept on singing until the tide passed right over her. Then all felt sad and held a feast for her at which they put food, blankets, and other things into the water.</P>
