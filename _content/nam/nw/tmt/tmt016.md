### 12. THE WOMAN WHO WAS KILLED BY A CLAM

There was a famine at a certain town and many people had to depend on
shellfish, so the women went down to the beach at low tide every day to
gather them. One time a chief's daughter went down and reached far under
a rock to find some clams. Then a large bivalve called xît closed upon
her hand, holding her prisoner. Presently the tide began to rise, and,
when it had almost reached her, she began singing a song about herself.
She kept on singing until the tide passed right over her. Then all felt
sad and held a feast for her at which they put food, blankets, and other
things into the water.
