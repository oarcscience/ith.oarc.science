<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">61. THE EAST AND NORTH WINDS</H3>
<P>A high-caste man married the daughter of East-wind (S&acirc;'nAxet). After a time he heard of a very pretty high-caste girl, the daughter of North-wind (<U>X</U>&ucirc;n), so he left his first wife, came north, and married her. Then he took her back to the village where his first wife lived.</P>
<P>Now the people said to his first wife, "There is a very pretty woman here. Her clothes are, very valuable and sparkle all over. They make a noise like bells." East-wind's daughter was at once jealous and said, "I will soon be able to fix that pretty girl you boys are talking about." Quite a while afterward it began to grow cloudy and warm, and sure enough the daughter of North-wind lost all of her beautiful clothing. It was icicles and frost that were so pretty, and when she lost these she lost her beauty with them.</P>
