### 102. THE SEA-LION HUNT

A canoe \[load of people\] came behind the sea lions at Cape Ommaney.
And they camped behind them. In the morning they went out to the
sea-lion island. They sharpened limbs on the ends to make the sea lions
sneeze and pushed them into their noses. In that way they killed off all
the sea lions.
