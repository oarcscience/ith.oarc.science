This is the last thing that happened in the Raven story. From this time
on everything is about spirits (yêk) over and over again. Very few
people believed in Nâs-cA'k<u>î</u>-yêl. Most believed in the spirits.
From the time that these come into the story you hear little about Raven
because people had so much more faith in spirits. You notice that in
every Tlingit town in Alaska there are shamans, and years ago, when a
shaman died, there was always one right after him, and he was always of
the same family. It is through these that the Raven story has been
getting less and less.
