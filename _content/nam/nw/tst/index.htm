<P>This is a collection of texts from the Tsimshian, who lived (and continue
to reside) on the northwestern coast of British Columbia.
An earlier (1902) collection of <A HREF="../nass/index">Tsimshian Texts</A>
by Boas, is also available at Intangible Textual Heritage.
<P>
</P>
The first three are tales of culture heroes and heroines,
far longer than most texts of this kind.
These first three stories, with legendary quests, mysterious
supernatural beings and atmospheric descriptions,
remind one of Icelandic sagas.
Following these are a couple of short and fairly unremarkable
animal rivalry stories.
The last item is a notable deluge myth which appears to have very little
if any European influence.</P>
<P>
Boas' Tsimshian translations have been criticized recently, as has
his relationship with his informants as employer.
There is no reason to believe, however, that these texts are not authentic.
Boas was a primary figure in the dawn of modern anthropology,
and the operating procedures and theory of ethnography were
still being worked out at the time.
