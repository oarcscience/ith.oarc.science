### Sisuith or Se-Sook, THE TWO-HEADED SNAKE

Among the clan legends of the Northwest Indians at Alert Bay, one of the
most important is that of **Sisuith** or **Se-Sook**.

**Sisuith** was a fabulous double-headed, horned, **Oluk** (Snake) with
his heads one at each end. In the middle there was a human head with two
protruding horns. This **Ta-mah-no-us oluk** (mystic snake) had the
power to assume the shape of a fish and it was said that when he swam in
the rivers he was measuring the life of the people.

The penalty of seeing, touching or eating **Sisuith** was a horrifying
death. The joints of the victim were dislocated and the body bent
backwards until the head touched the heels. Wherever Sisuith's
**pil-pil** (blood) touched the skin of a human being, it turned to
stone.

The ancestors of the Indians possessed [supernatural](errata.htm#16)
**Skookum** (power) and were favored by [**Sisuith**](errata.htm#17). If
they possessed a belt made of his cast-off skin they were capable of
performing magical feats such as turning **Sisuith** into a canoe which
could move very rapidly through the water with the aid of its powerful
fins. The eyes could be used as slinging stones with disastrous effect
against their enemies.

The Houses of these mythical people had **Sisuith** carved on their
cross-beams and when visitors entered the tongues of the serpent would
constantly wag.

These symbols are used by clan members today in the ornamenting of their
houses and articles of daily use. They are also carved on their Totem
Poles.
