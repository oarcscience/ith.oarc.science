### PREFACE

The object of writing the "Thunder Bird" Legends is: To induce the
Indians to think about themselves and to unite and band them together in
all common purposes. Although they are heirs of the ages, the mighty
forces of modern democracy threaten to strip them of their wise
primitive culture as it has done to almost all of the American Indian
tribes:

That these tales will give the Indians courage to guard and defend
themselves from those who would transgress upon their inherited rights
and privileges by imbuing them with thoughts and ideals of their own.

It is also hoped they will stir within, and unfold, their artistic
talents, expand and develop their abilities, enabling them to
[acquire](errata.htm#0) a greater and wider mode of life.

Throughout these stories an effort has been made to tell how the Indian
Tribes lived, their hospitality and friendliness; the philosophical
ideas of a heroic race of nature-loving people.

It is expected that the legends will be criticised by the Indians
themselves as well as by others who have a greater knowledge than the
writer has [acquired](errata.htm#1), but he nevertheless hopes that they
will be accepted in the spirit in which they are dedicated.
