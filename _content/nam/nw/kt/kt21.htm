<P>He saw a salmon jumping. "Hay&ucirc;'!" He said, "Hay&ucirc;'! If I should jump, I should come and jump inside of this tide-ripple." Then it came and jumped. Again he said, "Hay&ucirc;'! If I should jump, I should jump outside of this kelp." Then it jumped there. Again he said, "Hay&ucirc;'! If I should jump, I should jump in the middle of this kelp." It came and jumped. Again he said, Hay&ucirc;'! If I should jump, I should jump on the land side of this kelp." It came and jumped. Then again he said, "Hay&ucirc;'! If I should jump, I should jump almost on the rocks."</P>
