<P>Then &Ocirc;'?m&acirc;<STRIKE>l</STRIKE> painted his tribe. They carried up the fishes. Then the harlequin duck, and the buffle-head, and all the birds, and all the animals, were, painted.

It reached several of the people of &Ocirc;'?m&acirc;<STRIKE>l</STRIKE>. These dived on the islands; and those who were not caught by the sea became the land-birds. The flood came quickly. The snail had not gone down to the beach.</P>
