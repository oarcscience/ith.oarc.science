<P>Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;qi?la<U>x</U><SUP>u</SUP> went on. He saw a large bird, the thunder-bird. The thunder-bird was eating the double-headed serpent. Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;qi?la<U>x</U><SUP>u</SUP> took the back of the double-headed serpent. He put the back of the serpent on as a belt. He took the eyes of the double-headed serpent and threw them as sling-stones at the whale. The whale died. Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;qi?la<U>x</U><SUP>u</SUP> took the whale and threw it inland. Then he threw sling-stones at another whale, and the whale died. Then he threw sling-stones at another whale. He took the whale and threw it up shore; and again he threw sling-stones at a whale, ---- at another whale. He took the whale and threw it up shore. Then he finished. Then he had enough for food for Only-One.</P>
