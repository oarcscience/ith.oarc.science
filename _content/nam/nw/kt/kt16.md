# Mink marries Diorite-Woman

(Dictated by Yâ'<u>g</u>ô<u>L</u>as, a ?nE'm<u>g</u>ês, 1900.)

"Mother, I want to marry."--"Who is it?"--"Oh, Diorite-Woman."--"Well,
then, try again. Will you not be tired if she does not talk?"--"That is
what I like." Then he went to his future wife. Night came, and they lay
down. He tried to speak to his wife. "Speak!" said Born-to-be-the-Sun to
his wife. "You're a funny fellow," she said. "Speak, else I will hit
your face." Then he struck his wife's face. "Serves you right. Now your
face is all bloody." But it was blood of the hand of Born-to-be-the-Sun.
It could not be blood on the face of Diorite-Woman, because she was a
stone. And he left. "Mother, I left my wife. I did something to her
because she didn't speak."--"Did I not tell you?" said Mother.
