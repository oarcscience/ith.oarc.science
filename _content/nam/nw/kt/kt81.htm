<P ALIGN="CENTER">Tradition of S&icirc;'sEnL&ecirc;?, a Clan of the Nimkish.</P>
<P>?nEm&ocirc;'gwis travelled northward, coming from Seymour Narrows. He made war upon the people and destroyed many villages. Finally he went up Nimkish River, and came to the mountain Ts!Ex*&ecirc;'wak<SUP>u</SUP>. There he acquired supernatural power. A goose (nEla') came to live with him, assumed the form of a person, and became the ancestor of his tribe. They lived in Foundation (<U>X</U>ulk<SUP>u</SUP>). When the goose assumed the shape of a person, his wife also became a human being, and they had many children. They came to be a bad people. ?nEm&ocirc;'gwis and the goose are the ancestors of the S&icirc;'sEnL&ecirc;?.</P>
<P>?nEmx*&acirc;'lik&ocirc; is also given as the name of the ancestors of the S&icirc;'sEnL&ecirc;?.</P>
