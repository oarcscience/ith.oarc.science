<P>Then Q!&acirc;'n&ecirc;qi?la<U>x</U><SUP>u</SUP> saw (two people) coming towards him. Then the one moved his head toward that of the other. They cohabited. Behold, they were this way, the one had her vulva on the forehead, the other had his penis on the forehead. "Go on, lie down on the beach and cohabit!" Then they lay down. "Embrace her neck, place yourself between (her legs), cohabit. That is the way." Then he fixed them. It was finished.</P>
