### Ô'?mâ~~l~~ obtains the Water.

Then Ô'?mâ~~l~~ took the stomach of K\*!eg\*î'~~l~~bala and put it in

Then he took excrements and entered the house of Virgin. She was asleep.
Then he lifted her blanket and put the excrements behind Virgin. "Oh!"
said Ô'?mâ~~l~~ to Virgin, "don't sleep!" Thus said Ô'?mâ~~l~~ to
Virgin. "You have made a mess. Let me swallow some of your water," said
Ô'?mâ~~l~~. "You may do so," said Virgin. Then he drank. He had not
swallowed much water. Then he was taken by the nape of the neck by

any of your water." Thus said Ô'?mâ~~l~~. "Let me tell about the mess
you made," said Ô'?mâ~~l~~. "Then go

on and drink!" He drank. He drank all the water of Virgin. Then Virgin
became a bluejay, when she had no more water. Ô'?mâ~~l~~ began to fly
all around our world, making water. That is how all our people obtained
water.
