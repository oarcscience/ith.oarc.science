Then he went search in of food. He found Crabapple-Owner.
Crabapple-Owner was climbing about. Then he became a child again. "Wuâ',
wuâ', wuâ'!" said Greedy-One. Then the woman saw the child. "Â, â, â,
â!" said the woman to the child, for he had again become a child,
although he had been full grown. Then he entered the house of the woman,
Crabapple-Woman. She had Greedy-One for her child. Then he ate the food
of the woman, and he ate it all.
