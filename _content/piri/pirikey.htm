<P ALIGN="CENTER">[From "The Oldest Map of America," by Professor Dr. Afet Inan. 
  Ankara, 1954, pp. 28-34.]</P>
<P><A NAME="I">I.</A> There is a kind of red dye called vakami, that you do not 
  observe at first, because it is at a distance . . . the mountains contain rich 
  ores. . . . There some of the sheep have silken wool.</P>
<P><A NAME="II">II.</A> This country is inhabited. The entire population goes 
  naked.</P>
<P><A NAME="III">III.</A> This region is known as the vilayet of Antilia. It is 
  on the side where the sun sets. They say that there are four kinds of parrots, 
  white, red, green and black. The people eat the flesh of parrots and their headdress 
  is made entirely of parrots' feathers. There is a stone here. It resembles black 
  touchstone. The people use it instead of the ax. That it is very hard . . . 
  [illegible]. JPe saw that stone.</P>
<P>[NOTE: Piri Reis writes in the "Babriye": "In the enemy ships which we captured 
  in the Mediterranean, we found a headdress made of these parrot feathers, and 
  also a stone resembling touchstone."]</P>
<P><A NAME="IV">IV.</A> This map was drawn by Piri Ibn Haji Mehmed, known as the 
  nephew of Kemal Reis, in Gallipoli, in the month of muharrem of the year 919 
  (that is, between the 9th of March and the 7th of April of the year 1513).</P>
<P><A NAME="V">V.</A> This section tells how these shores and also these islands 
  were found.</P>
<P>These coasts are named the shores of Antilia. They were discovered in the year 
  896 of the Arab calendar. But it is reported thus, that a Genoese infidel, his 
  name was Colombo, be it was who discovered these places. For instance, a book 
  fell into the hands of the said Colombo, and be found it said in this book that 
  at the end of the Western Sea [Atlantic] that is, on its western side, there 
  were coasts and islands and all kinds of metals and also precious stones. The 
  above-mentioned, having studied this book thoroughly, explained these matters 
  one by one to the great of Genoa and said: "Come, give me two ships, let me 
  go and find these places." They said: "O unprofitable man, can an end or a 
  limit be found to the Western Sea? Its vapour is full of darkness." The above-mentioned 
  Colombo saw that no help was forthcoming from the Genoese, he sped forth, went 
  to the Bey of Spain [king], and told his tale in detail. They too answered like 
  the Genoese. In brief Colombo petitioned these people for a long time, finally 
  the Bey of Spain gave him two ships, saw that they were well equipped, and said:</P>
<P>"O Colombo, if it happens as you say, let us make you kapudan [admiral] to 
  that country." Having said which he sent the said Colombo to the Western Sea. 
  The late Gazi Kemal had a Spanish slave. The above-mentioned slave said to Kemal 
  Reis, he had been three times to that land with Colombo. He said: "First we 
  reached the Strait of Gibraltar, then from there straight south and west between 
  the two . . . [illegible]. Having advanced straight four thousand miles, we 
  saw an island facing us, but gradually the waves of the sea became foamless, 
  that is, the sea was becalmed and the North Star--the seamen on their compasses 
  still say star--little by little was veiled and became invisible, and be also 
  said that the stars in that region are not arranged as here. They are seen in 
  a different arrangement. They anchored at the island which they had seen earlier 
  across the way, the population of the island came, shot arrows at them and did 
  not allow them to land and ask for information. The males and the females shot 
  hand arrows. The tips of these arrows were made of fishbones, and the whole 
  population went naked and also very . . . [illegible]. Seeing that they could 
  not land on that island; they crossed to the other side of the island, they 
  saw a boat. On seeing them; the boat fled and they [the people in the boat] 
  dashed out on land. They [the Spaniards] took the boat. They saw that inside 
  of it there was human flesh. It happened that these people were of that nation 
  which went from island to island hunting men and eating them. They said Colombo 
  saw yet another island, they neared it, they saw that on that island there were 
  great snakes. They avoided landing on this island and remained there seventeen 
  days. The people of this island saw that no harm came to them from this boat, 
  they caught fish and brought it to them in their small ship's boat [filika]. 
  These [Spaniards] were pleased and gave them glass beads. It appears that he 
  [Columbus] had read-in the book that in that region glass beads were valued. 
  Seeing the beads they brought still more fish. These [Spaniards] always gave 
  them glass beads. One day they saw gold around the arm of a woman, they took 
  the gold and gave her beads. They said to them, to bring more gold, we will 
  give you more beads, [they said]. They went and brought them much gold. It appears 
  that in their mountains there were gold mines. One day, also, they saw pearls 
  in the hands of one person. They saw that when; they gave beads, many more pearls 
  were brought to them. Pearls were found on the shore of this island, in a spot 
  one or two fathoms deep. And also loading their ship with many logwood trees 
  and taking two natives along, they carried them within that year to the Bey 
  of Spain. But the said Colombo, not knowing the language of these people, they 
  traded by signs, and after this trip the Bey of Spain sent priests and barley, 
  taught the natives how to sow and reap and converted them to his own religion. 
  They had no religion of any sort. They walked naked and lay there like animals. 
  Now these regions have been opened to all and have become famous. The names 
  which mark the places on the said islands and coasts were given by Colombo, 
  that these places may be known by them. And also Colombo was a great astronomer. 
  The coasts and island on this map are taken from Colombo's map.</P>
<P><A NAME="VI">VI.</A> This section shows in what way this map was drawn. In 
  this century there is no map like this map in anyone's possession. The--hand 
  of this poor man has drawn it and now it is constructed. From about twenty charts 
  and Mappae Mundi--these are charts drawn in the days of Alexander, Lord of the 
  Two Horns, which show the inhabited quarter of the world; the Arabs name these 
  charts Jaferiye--from eight Jaferiyes of that kind and one Arabic map of Hind, 
  and from the maps just drawn by four Portuguese which show the countries of 
  Hind, Sind and China geometrically drawn, and also from a map drawn by Colombo 
  in the western region I have extracted it. By reducing all these maps to one 
  scale this final form was arrived at. So that the present map is as correct 
  and reliable for the Seven Seas as the map of these our countries is considered 
  correct and reliable by seamen.</P>
<P><A NAME="VII">VII.</A> It is related by the Portuguese infidel that in this 
  spot night and day are at their shortest of two hours, at their longest of twenty 
  two hours. But the day is very warm and in the night there is much dew.</P>
<P><A NAME="VIII">VIII.</A> On the way to the vilayet of Hind a Portuguese ship 
  encountered a contrary wind [blowing] from the shore. The wind from the shore 
  . . . [illegible] it [the ship]. After being driven by a storm in a southern 
  direction they saw a shore opposite them they advanced towards it [illegible]. 
  They saw that these places are good anchorages. They threw anchor and went to 
  the shore in boats. They saw people walking, all of them naked. But they shot 
  arrows, their tips made of fishbone. They stayed there eight days. They traded 
  with these people by signs. That barge saw these lands and wrote about them 
  which. . . . The said barge without going to Hind, returned to Portugal, where, 
  upon arrival it gave information. . . . They described these shores in detail. 
  . . . They have discovered them.</P>
<P><A NAME="IX">IX.</A> And in this country it seems that there are white-haired 
  monsters in this shape, and also six-horned oxen. The Portuguese infidels have 
  written it in their maps. . . .</P>
<P><A NAME="X">X.</A> This country is a waste. Everything is in ruin and it is 
  said that large snakes are found here. For this reason the Portuguese infidels 
  did not land on these shores and these are also said to be very hot.</P>
<P><A NAME="XI">XI.</A> And these four ships are Portuguese ships. Their shape 
  is written down. They travelled from the western land to the point of Abyssinia 
  [Habesh] in order to reach India. They said towards Shuluk. The distance across 
  this gulf is 4200 miles.</P>
<P><A NAME="XII">XII.</A> .... On this shore a tower<BR>
  .... is however<BR>
  .... in this climate gold<BR>
  .... taking a rope<BR>
  .... is said they measured</P>
<P>[NOTE: The fact that half of each of these lines is missing is the clearest 
  proof of the map's having been torn in two.]</P>
<P><A NAME="XIII">XIII.</A> And a Genoese kuke [a type of ship] coming from Flanders 
  was caught in a storm. Impelled by the storm it came upon these islands, and 
  in this manner these islands became known.</P>
<P><A NAME="XIV">XIV.</A> It is said that in ancient times a priest by the name 
  of Sanvolrandan (Santo Brandan) travelled on the Seven Seas, so they say. The 
  above-mentioned landed on this fish. They thought it dry land and lit a fire 
  upon this fish, when the fish's back began to burn it plunged into the sea, 
  they reembarked in their boats and fled to the ship. This event is not mentioned 
  by the Portuguese infidels. It is taken from the ancient Mappae Mundi.</P>
<P><A NAME="XV">XV.</A> To these small islands they have given the name of Undizi 
  Vergine. That is to say the Eleven Virgins.</P>
<P><A NAME="XVI">XVI.</A> And this island they call the Island of Antilia. There 
  are many monsters and parrots and much logwood. It is not inhabited.</P>
<P><A NAME="XVII">XVII.</A> This barge was driven upon these shores by a storm 
  and remained where it fell. . . . Its name was Nicola di Giuvan. On his map 
  it is written that these rivers which can be seen have for the most part gold 
  [in their beds]. When the water had gone they collected much gold [dust] from 
  the sand. On their map. . . .</P>
<P><A NAME="XVIII">XVIII.</A> This is the barge from Portugal which encountered 
  a storm and cam( to this land. The details are written on the edge of this map. 
  [NOTE: see VIII.]</P>
<P><A NAME="XIX">XIX.</A> The Portuguese infidels do not go west of here. All 
  that side belongs entirely to Spain. They have made an agreement that [a line] 
  two thousand miles to the western side of the Strait of Gibraltar should be 
  taken as a boundary. The Portuguese do not cross to that side but the Hind side 
  and the southern side belong to the Portuguese.</P>
<P><A NAME="XX">XX.</A> And this caravel having encountered a storm was driven 
  upon this island. Its name was Nicola Giuvan. And on this island there are many 
  oxen with one horn. For this reason they call this island Isle de Vacca, which 
  means, Ox Island.</P>
<P><A NAME="XXI">XXI.</A> The admiral of this caravel is named Messir Anton the 
  Genoese, but be grew up in Portugal. One day the above-mentioned caravel encountered 
  a storm, it was driven upon this island. He found much ginger here and has written 
  about these islands.</P>
<P><A NAME="XXII">XXII.</A> This sea is called the Western Sea, but the Frank 
  sailors call it the Mare d'Espagna. Which means the Sea of Spain. Up to now 
  it was known by these names, but Colombo, who opened up this sea and made these 
  islands known, and also the Portuguese, infidels who have opened up the region 
  of Hind have agreed together to give this sea a new name. They have given it 
  the name of Ovo Sano [Oceano] that is to say, sound egg. Before this it was 
  thought that the sea had no end or limit, that at its other end was darkness. 
  Now they have seen that this sea is girded by a coast, because it is like a 
  lake, they have called it Ovo Sano.</P>
<P><A NAME="XXIII">XXIII.</A> In this spot there are oxen with one horn, and also 
  monsters in this shape.</P>
<P><A NAME="XXIV">XXIV.</A> These monsters are seven spans long. Between their 
  eyes there is a distance of one span. But they are harmless souls.</P>
