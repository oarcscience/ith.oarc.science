<p>THE Kings to the Stable<br> They brought sweet spice,<br> The gold and the silver,<br> And jewels of price.<br> But the Dove by the manger<br> She would not cease<br> Mourning so softly:<br> Bring Him Peace; bring Him Peace!<br> The Kings from the Orient<br> Brought nard and clove.<br> The Dove went mourning:<br> Bring Him Love; Bring Him Love.<br> What would content Him<br> In silver and gold,--<br> A new-born Baby<br> But one hour old?<br> Not myrrh shall please Him<br> Nor the ambergris,<br> What hath sweet savour<br> Of His mother's kiss?<br> There is clash of battle,<br> And men hate and slay:<br> From the noise and the tumult<br> She hides Him away.<br> But His sleep is fitful<br> In His Mother's breast,<br> The Dove goes mourning:<br> Give Him rest; give Him rest!</p>
