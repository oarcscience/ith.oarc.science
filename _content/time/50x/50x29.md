### BEFORE DAWN

DIM-BERRIED is the mistletoe  
With globes of sheenless grey,  
The holly mid ten thousand thorns  
Smolders its fires away;  
And in the manger Jesu sleeps  
This Christmas Day.  
Bull unto bull with hollow throat  
Makes echo every hill,  
Cold sheep in pastures thick with snow  
The air with bleatings fill;  
While of His Mother's heart this Babe  
Takes His sweet will.  
All flowers and butterflies lie hid,  
The blackbird and the thrush  
Pipe but a little as they flit  
Restless from bush to bush;  
Even to the robin Gabriel hath  
Cried softly, "Hush!"  
Now night is astir with burning stars  
In darkness of the snow;  
Burdened with frankincense and myrrh  
And gold the Strangers go  
Into a dusk where one dim lamp  
Burns faintly, Lo!  
No snowdrop yet its small head nods,  
In winds of winter drear;  
No lark at casement in the sky  
Sings matins shrill and clear;  
Yet in this frozen mirk the Dawn  
Breathes, Spring is here!

--WALTER DE LA MARE
