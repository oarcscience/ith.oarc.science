<p>ON a winter's night long time ago<br> (The bells ring loud and the bells ring low),<br> When high howled wind, and down fell snow<br> (Carillon, Carilla).<br> Saint Joseph he and Nostre Dame,<br> Riding on an ass, full weary came<br> From Nazareth into Bethlehem.<br> And the small child Jesus smile on you.</p>  <h4 align="center">II</h4>  
<p>And Bethlehem inn they stood before<br> (The bells ring less and the bells ring more),<br> The landlord bade them begone from his door<br> (Carillon, Carilla).<br> "Poor folk" (says he), "must lie where they may,<br> For the Duke of Jewry comes this way,<br> With all his train on Christmas Day."<br> And the small child Jesus smile on you.</p>  <h4 align="center">III</h4>  
<p>Poor folk that may my carol hear<br> (The bells ring single and the bells ring clear),<br> See! God's one child had hardest cheer!<br> (Carillon, Carilla).<br> Men grown hard on a Christmas morn;<br> The dumb beast by and a babe forlorn.<br> It was very, very cold when our Lord was born.<br> And the small child Jesus smile on you.</p>  <h4 align="center">IV</h4>  
<p>Now these were Jews as Jews must be<br> (The bells ring merry and the bells ring free).<br> But Christian men in a band are we<br> Carillon, Carilla).<br> Empty we go, and ill be-dight,<br> Singing Noel on a winter's night.<br> Give up to sup by the warm firelight,<br> And the small child Jesus smile on you.</p>
