<p>THE Christmas moon shines clear and right;<br> There were poor travellers such a night<br> Had neither fire nor candle-light.</p>  
<p>One plucked them stars out of the sky<br> To show the road to travel by;<br> So that the Ass go warily.</p>  
<p>She had all Heaven safe in her hold,<br> Hidden within her mantle's fold--<br> All Heaven, and It was one hour old.</p>  
<p>Her hair under, over Him spread<br> His spun-gold coverlet and His bed,<br> Twined with His little golden head.</p>  
<p>She sang and rocked Him to-and-fro<br> Such songs as little babies know,<br> With Lullaby Sweet, and Lullalo.</p>  
<p>He had no need of moons and suns,<br> Nor the gold-crested bird-legions,<br> Singing their lauds and orisons.</p>  
<p>The Christmas moon shows a cold beam;<br> He hath His Mother, she hath Him:<br> Together they sleep, together dream.</p>  
<p>--KATHARINE TYNAN</p>
