<p>WE are the poor children, come out to see the&nbsp; sights<br> On this day of all days, on this night of nights,<br> The stars in merry parties are dancing in the sky,<br> A fine star, a new star, is shining on high!</p>  
<p>We are the poor children, our lips are frosty blue,<br> We cannot sing our carol as well as rich folk do,<br> Our bellies are so empty we have no singing voice,<br> But this night of all nights good children must rejoice.</p>  
<p>We do rejoice, we do rejoice, as hard as we can try,<br> A fine star, a new star is shining in the sky!<br> And while we sing our carol, we think of the delight<br> The happy kings and shepherds make in Bethlehem to-night.</p>  
<p>Are we naked, mother, and are we starving poor--<br> Oh, see what gifts the kings have brought outside the stable door,<br> Are we cold, mother, the ass will give his hay<br> To make the manger warm and keep the cruel winds away.</p>  
<p>We are the poor children, but not so poor who sing<br> Our carol with our voiceless hearts to greet the newborn king,<br> On this night of all nights, when in the frosty sky<br> A new star, a kind star, is shining on high!</p>
