### THAT HOLY THING

THEY all were looking for a king  
To slay their foes and lift them high:  
Thou cam'st, a little baby thing  
That made a woman cry.

O Son of Man, to right my lot  
Naught but Thy presence can avail;  
Yet on the road Thy wheels are not,  
Nor on the sea Thy sail!

My how or when Thou wilt not heed,  
But come down thine own secret stair,  
That Thou mayst answer all my need--  
Yea, every bygone prayer.

--GEORGE MACDONALD
