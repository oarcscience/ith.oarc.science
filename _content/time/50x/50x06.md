### THE LAMB

LITTLE lamb, who made thee?  
Dost thou know who made thee,  
Gave thee life, and bade thee feed  
By the stream and o'er the mead;  
Gave thee clothing of delight,  
Softest clothing, woolly, bright;  
Gave thee such a tender voice,  
Making all the vales rejoice?  
Little lamb, who made thee?  
Dost thou know who made thee?

Little lamb, I'll tell thee;  
Little lamb, I'll tell thee;  
He is called by thy name,  
For He calls Himself a lamb;  
He is meek and He is mild,  
He became a little child.  
I a child and thou a lamb,  
We are called by His name.  
Little lamb, God bless thee!  
Little lamb, God bless thee!

--WILLIAM BLAKE
