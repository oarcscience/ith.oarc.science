### IN PRAESEPIO

IN stable straw the Infant lay,  
Turned from the hostelry away,  
There was no room its doors within,  
For Him Who is the whole world's Inn.

Creation sang, no longer dumb,  
Because her great Desire was come;  
The sad earth in His joy had part,  
Who bore her sorrow in His Heart.

The Angels danced, the Shepherds piped,  
Because earth's tears away were wiped;  
The Ox and Ass adoring saw  
The Infant lying in the straw.

--R. L. GALES
