<p>IN stable straw the Infant lay,<br> Turned from the hostelry away,<br> There was no room its doors within,<br> For Him Who is the whole world's Inn.</p>  
<p>Creation sang, no longer dumb,<br> Because her great Desire was come;<br> The sad earth in His joy had part,<br> Who bore her sorrow in His Heart.</p>  
<p>The Angels danced, the Shepherds piped,<br> Because earth's tears away were wiped;<br> The Ox and Ass adoring saw<br> The Infant lying in the straw.</p>  
<p>--R. L. GALES</p>
