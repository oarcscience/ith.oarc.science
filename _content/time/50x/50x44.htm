<p>I SAW three ships come sailing in,<br> On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;<br> I saw three ships come sailing in<br> On Christmas Day in the morning.</p>  
<p>And who was in those ships all three,<br> On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day?<br> And who was in those ships all three,<br> On Christmas Day in the morning?</p>  
<p>Our Saviour Christ and his ladye,<br> On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;<br> Our Saviour Christ and his ladye,<br> On Christmas Day in the morning.</p>  
<p>Pray whither sailed those ships all three,<br> On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day?<br> Pray whither sailed those ships all three,<br> On Christmas Day in the morning?</p>  
<p>O they sailed into Bethlehem,<br> On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;<br> O they sailed into Bethlehem,<br> On Christmas Day in the morning.</p>  
<p>And all the bells on Earth shall ring,<br> On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;<br> And all the bells on Earth shall ring,<br> On Christmas Day in the morning.</p>  
<p>And all the angels in Heaven shall sing,<br> On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;<br> And all the angels in Heaven shall sing,<br> On Christmas Day in the morning.</p>  
<p>And all the souls on Earth shall sing,<br> On Christmas Day, on Christmas Day;<br> And all the souls on Earth shall sing,<br> On Christmas Day in the morning.</p>
