<p>GO pretty child, and bear this flower<br> Unto thy little Saviour;<br> And tell Him, by that bud now blown,<br> He is the Rose of Sharon known:<br> When thou hast said so, stick it there<br> Upon his bib, or stomacher:<br> And tell Him, (for good handsell too)<br> That thou hast bought a whistle new,<br> Made of a clean straight oaten reed,<br> To charm His cries, (at time of need:)<br> Tell Him, for coral, thou hast none;<br> But if thou hadst, He should have one;<br> But poor thou art, and known to be<br> Even as moneyless as He.<br> Lastly, if thou canst win a kiss<br> From those mellifluous lips of His;<br> Then never take a second on<br> To spoil the first impression.</p>
