<P>We have now to leave the commemoration of the Nativity of Christ, and to turn 
to the other side of Christmas&#65279;&#8212;its many traditional observances which, though 
sometimes coloured by Christianity, have nothing to do with the Birth of the 
Redeemer. This class of customs has often, especially in the first millennium of 
our era, been the object of condemnations by ecclesiastics, and represents the 
old paganism which Christianity failed to extinguish. The Church has played a 
double part, a part of sheer antagonism, forcing heathen customs into the shade, 
into a more or less surreptitious and unprogressive life, and a part of 
adaptation, baptizing them into Christ, giving them a Christian name and 
interpretation, and often modifying their form. The general effect of 
Christianity upon pagan usages is well suggested by Dr. Karl Pearson:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&#8220;What the missionary could he repressed, the more as his church grew in 
  strength; what he could not repress he adopted or simply left unregarded.... 
  What the missionary tried to repress became mediaeval witchcraft; what he 
  judiciously disregarded survives to this <A NAME="page_162"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 162</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_162"></A>day in peasant weddings and in the folk-festivals at the 
  great changes of season.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-1">7-1</A><a name="Nanchor_7-1"></A> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We find then many pagan practices concealed beneath a superficial 
Christianity&#65279;&#8212;often under the mantle of some saint&#65279;&#8212;but side by side with these 
are many usages never Christianized even in appearance, and obviously identical 
with heathen customs against which the Church thundered in the days of her 
youth. Grown old and tolerant&#65279;&#8212;except of novelties&#65279;&#8212;she has long since ceased to 
attack them, and they have themselves mostly lost all definite religious 
meaning. As the old pagan faith decayed, they tended to become in a literal 
sense &#8220;superstition,&#8221; something standing over, like shells from which the living 
occupant has gone. They are now often mere &#8220;survivals&#8221; in the technical 
folk-lore sense, pieces of custom separated from the beliefs that once gave them 
meaning, performed only because in a vague sort of way they are supposed to 
bring good luck. In many cases those who practise them would be quite unable to 
explain how or why they work for good.</P>
<P>Mental inertia, the instinct to do and believe what has always been done and 
believed, has sometimes preserved the animating faith as well as the external 
form of these practices, but often all serious significance has departed. What 
was once religious or magical ritual, upon the due observance of which the 
welfare of the community was believed to depend, has become mere pageantry and 
amusement, often a mere children's game.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-2">7-2</A><a name="Nanchor_7-2"></A> </P>
<P>Sometimes the spirit of a later age has worked upon these pagan customs, 
revivifying and transforming them, giving them charm. Often, however, one does 
not find in them the poetry, the warm humanity, the humour, which mark the 
creations of popular Catholicism. They are fossils and their interest is that of 
the fossil: they are records of a vanished world and help us to an imaginative 
reconstruction of it. But further, just as on a stratum of rock rich in fossils 
there may be fair meadows and gardens and groves, depending for their life on 
the denudation of the rock beneath, so have these ancient religious products 
largely supplied the soil in which more spiritual and more <A NAME="page_163"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 163</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_163"></A>beautiful things have flourished. Amid these, as has been 
well said, &#8220;they still emerge, unchanged and unchanging, like the quaint 
outcrops of some ancient rock formation amid rich vegetation and fragrant 
flowers.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-3">7-3</A><a name="Nanchor_7-3"></A> </P>
<P>The survivals of pagan religion at Christian festivals relate not so much to 
the worship of definite divinities&#65279;&#8212;against this the missionaries made their 
most determined efforts, and the names of the old gods have practically 
disappeared&#65279;&#8212;as to cults which preceded the development of anthropomorphic gods 
with names and attributes. These cults, paid to less personally conceived 
spirits, were of older standing and no doubt had deeper roots in the popular 
mind. Fundamentally associated with agricultural and pastoral life, they have in 
many cases been preserved by the most conservative element in the population, 
the peasantry.</P>
<P>Many of the customs we shall meet with are magical, rather than religious in 
the proper sense; they are not directed to the conciliation of spiritual beings, 
but spring from primitive man's belief &#8220;that in order to produce the great 
phenomena of nature on which his life depended he had only to imitate them.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-4">7-4</A><a name="Nanchor_7-4"></A> Even when they have a definitely religious character, 
and are connected with some spirit, magical elements are often found in 
them.</P>
<P>Before we consider these customs in detail it will be necessary to survey the 
pagan festivals briefly alluded to in &nbsp;<a href="crt04.htm#Chapter_I">I</A>, to note the various ideas and practices that characterized them, and to 
study the attitude of the Church towards survivals of such practices while the 
conversion of Europe was in progress, and also during the Middle Ages.</P>
<P>The development of religious custom and belief in Europe is a matter of such 
vast complexity that I cannot in a book of this kind attempt more than the 
roughest outline of the probable origins of the observances, purely pagan or 
half-Christianized, clustering round Christmas. It is difficult, in the present 
state of knowledge, to discern clearly the contributions of different peoples to 
the traditional customs of Europe, and even, in many cases, to say whether a 
given custom is &#8220;Aryan&#8221; or pre-Aryan. The proportion of the Aryan military 
aristocracy to the peoples whom they conquered was not uniform in all countries, 
and <A NAME="page_164"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 164</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_164"></A>probably was often small. While the families of the 
conquerors succeeded in imposing their languages, it by no means necessarily 
follows that the folk-practices of countries now Aryan in speech came entirely 
or even chiefly from Aryan sources. Religious tradition has a marvellous power 
of persistence, and it must be remembered that the lands conquered by men of 
Aryan speech had been previously occupied for immense periods.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-5">7-5</A><a name="Nanchor_7-5"></A> Similarly, in countries like our own, which have been 
successively invaded by Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Danes, and Normans, it is 
often extraordinarily hard to say even to what <I>national</I> source a given 
custom should be assigned.</P>
<P>It is but tentatively and with uncertain hands that scholars are trying to 
separate the racial strains in the folk-traditions of Europe, and here I can 
hardly do more than point out three formative elements in Christian customs: the 
ecclesiastical, the classical (Greek and Roman), and the barbarian, taking the 
last broadly and without a minute racial analysis. So far, indeed, as ritual, 
apart from mythology, is concerned, there seems to be a broad common ground of 
tradition among the Aryan-speaking peoples. How far this is due to a common 
derivation we need not here attempt to decide. The folk-lore of the whole world, 
it is to be noted, &#8220;reveals for the same stages of civilization a wonderful 
uniformity and homogeneity.... This uniformity is not, however, due to necessary 
uniformity of origin, but to a great extent to the fact that it represents the 
state of equilibrium arrived at between minds at a certain level and their 
environment.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-6">7-6</A><a name="Nanchor_7-6"></A> </P>
<P>The scientific study of primitive religion is still almost in its infancy, 
and a large amount of conjecture must necessarily enter into any explanations of 
popular ritual that can be offered. In attempting to account for Christmas 
customs we must be mindful, therefore, of the tentative nature of the theories 
put forward. Again, it is important to remember that ritual practices are far 
more enduring than the explanations given to them. &#8220;The antique religions,&#8221; to 
quote the words of Robertson Smith, &#8220;had for the most part no creed; they 
consisted entirely of institutions and practices ... as a rule we find that 
while the practice was <A NAME="page_165"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 165</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_165"></A>rigorously fixed, the meaning attached to it was extremely 
vague, and the same rite was explained by different people in different 
ways.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-7">7-7</A><a name="Nanchor_7-7"></A> </P>
<P>Thus if we can arrive at the significance of a rite at a given period, it by 
no means follows that those who began it meant the same thing. At the time of 
the conflict of the heathen religions with Christianity elaborate structures of 
mythology had grown up around their traditional ceremonial, assigning to it 
meanings that had often little to do with its original purpose. Often, too, when 
the purpose was changed, new ceremonies were added, so that a rite may look very 
unlike what it was at first.</P>
<P>With these cautions and reservations we must now try to trace the connection 
between present-day or recent goings-on about Christmas-time and the festival 
practices of pre-Christian Europe.</P>
<P class=thoughtbreak>Christmas, as we saw in &nbsp;<a href="crt04.htm#Chapter_I">I</A>, has taken the date of the <I>Natalis Invicti</I>. We need not linger 
over this feast, for it was not attended by folk-customs, and there is nothing 
to connect it with modern survivals. The Roman festivals that really count for 
our present purpose are the Kalends of January and, probably, the 
<I>Saturnalia</I>. The influence of the Kalends is strongest naturally in the 
Latin countries, but is found also all over Europe. The influence of the 
<I>Saturnalia</I> is less certain; the festival is not mentioned in 
ecclesiastical condemnations after the institution of Christmas, and possibly 
its popularity was not so widespread as that of the Kalends. There are, however, 
some curiously interesting Christmas parallels to its usages.</P>
<P>The strictly religious feast of the <I>Saturnalia</I>&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-8">7-8</A><a name="Nanchor_7-8"></A> was held on December&nbsp;17, but the festal customs 
were kept up for seven days, thus lasting until the day before our Christmas 
Eve. Among them was a fair called the <I>sigillariorum celebritas</I>, for the 
sale of little images of clay or paste which were given away as presents.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_81">81</A><a name="FNanchor_81"></A> Candles seem also to have been given away, perhaps <A NAME="page_166"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 166</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_166"></A>as symbols of, or even charms to ensure, the return of the 
sun's power after the solstice. The most remarkable and typical feature, 
however, of the <I>Saturnalia</I> was the mingling of all classes in a common 
jollity. Something of the character of the celebration (in a Hellenized form) 
may be gathered from the &#8220;Cronia&#8221; or &#8220;Saturnalia&#8221; of Lucian, a dialogue between 
Cronus or Saturn and his priest. We learn from it that the festivities were 
marked by &#8220;drinking and being drunk, noise and games and dice, appointing of 
kings and feasting of slaves, singing naked, clapping of tremulous hands, an 
occasional ducking of corked faces in icy water,&#8221; and that slaves had licence to 
revile their lords.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-9">7-9</A><a name="Nanchor_7-9"></A> </P>
<P>The spirit of the season may be judged from the legislation which Lucian 
attributes to Cronosolon, priest and prophet of Cronus, much as a modern writer 
might make Father Christmas or Santa Klaus lay down rules for the due observance 
of Yule. Here are some of the laws:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&#8220;<I>All business, be it public or private, is forbidden during the feast 
  days, save such as tends to sport and solace and delight. Let none follow 
  their avocations saving cooks and bakers.</I></P>
  <P><I>All men shall be equal, slave and free, rich and poor, one with 
  another.</I></P>
  <P><I>Anger, resentment, threats, are contrary to law.</I></P>
  <P><I>No discourse shall be either composed or delivered, except it be witty 
  and lusty, conducing to mirth and jollity.</I>&nbsp;&#8221;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There follow directions as to the sending of presents of money, clothing, or 
vessels, by rich men to poor friends, and as to poor men's gifts in return. If 
the poor man have learning, his return gift is to be &#8220;an ancient book, but of 
good omen and festive humour, or a writing of his own after his ability.... For 
the unlearned, let him send a garland or grains of frankincense.&#8221; The 
&#8220;Cronosolon&#8221; closes with &#8220;Laws of the Board,&#8221; of which the following are a 
few:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&#8220;<I>Every man shall take place as chance may direct; dignities and birth 
  and wealth shall give no precedence.</I><A NAME="page_167"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 167</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_167"></A></P>
  <P><I>All shall be served with the same wine.... Every man's portion of meat 
  shall be alike.</I></P>
  <P><I>When the rich man shall feast his slaves, let his friends serve with 
  him.</I>&nbsp;&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-11">7-11</A><a name="Nanchor_7-11"></A> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Over the whole festival brooded the thought of a golden age in the distant 
past, when Saturn ruled, a just and kindly monarch, when all men were good and 
all men were happy.</P>
<P>A striking feature of the <I>Saturnalia</I> was the choosing by lot of a mock 
king, to preside over the revels. His word was law, and he was able to lay 
ridiculous commands upon the guests; &#8220;one,&#8221; says Lucian, &#8220;must shout out a libel 
on himself, another dance naked, or pick up the flute-girl and carry her thrice 
round the house.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-12">7-12</A><a name="Nanchor_7-12"></A> This king may have been originally the representative 
of the god Saturn himself. In the days of the classical writers he is a mere 
&#8220;Lord of Misrule,&#8221; but Dr. Frazer has propounded the very interesting theory 
that this time of privilege and gaiety was once but the prelude to a grim 
sacrifice in which he had to die in the character of the god, giving his life 
for the world.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-13">7-13</A><a name="Nanchor_7-13"></A> Dr. Frazer's theory, dependent for its evidence upon 
the narrative of the martyrdom of a fourth-century saint, Dasius by name, has 
been keenly criticized by Dr. Warde Fowler. He holds that there is nothing 
whatever to show that the &#8220;Saturn&#8221; who in the fourth century, according to the 
story, was sacrificed by soldiers on the Danube, had anything to do with the 
customs of ancient Rome.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-14">7-14</A><a name="Nanchor_7-14"></A> Still, in whatever way the king of the 
<I>Saturnalia</I> may be explained, it is interesting to note his existence and 
compare him with the merry monarchs whom we shall meet at Christmas and Twelfth 
Night.</P>
<P>How far the Saturnalian customs in general were of old Latin origin it is 
difficult to say; the name Saturnus (connected with the root of <I>serere</I>, 
to sow) and the date point to a real Roman festival of the sowing of the crops, 
but this was heavily overlaid with Greek ideas and practice.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-15">7-15</A><a name="Nanchor_7-15"></A> It is especially important to bear this in mind in 
considering Lucian's statements.</P>
<P>The same is true of the festival of the January Kalends, a few days after the 
<I>Saturnalia</I>. On January&nbsp;1, the Roman New <A NAME="page_168"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 168</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_168"></A>Year's Day, the new consuls were inducted into office, and 
for at least three days high festival was kept. The houses were decorated with 
lights and greenery&#65279;&#8212;these, we shall find, may be partly responsible for the 
modern Christmas-tree. As at the <I>Saturnalia</I> masters drank and gambled 
with slaves. <I>Vota</I>, or solemn wishes of prosperity for the Emperor during 
the New Year, were customary, and the people and the Senate were even expected 
to present gifts of money to him. The Emperor Caligula excited much disgust by 
publishing an edict requiring these gifts and by standing in the porch of his 
palace to receive them in person. Such gifts, not only presented to the Emperor, 
but frequently exchanged between private persons, were called <I>strenae</I>, a 
name still surviving in the French <I>&eacute;trennes</I> (New Year's presents).&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-16">7-16</A><a name="Nanchor_7-16"></A> </P>
<P>An interesting and very full account of the Kalends celebrations is given in 
two discourses of Libanius, the famous Greek sophist of the fourth 
century:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&#8220;The festival of the Kalends,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is celebrated everywhere as far as 
  the limits of the Roman Empire extend.... Everywhere may be seen carousals and 
  well-laden tables; luxurious abundance is found in the houses of the rich, but 
  also in the houses of the poor better food than usual is put upon the table. 
  The impulse to spend seizes everyone. He who the whole year through has taken 
  pleasure in saving and piling up his pence, becomes suddenly extravagant. He 
  who erstwhile was accustomed and preferred to live poorly, now at this feast 
  enjoys himself as much as his means will allow.... People are not only 
  generous towards themselves, but also towards their fellow-men. A stream of 
  presents pours itself out on all sides.... The highroads and footpaths are 
  covered with whole processions of laden men and beasts.... As the thousand 
  flowers which burst forth everywhere are the adornment of Spring, so are the 
  thousand presents poured out on all sides, the decoration of the Kalends 
  feast. It may justly be said that it is the fairest time of the year.... The 
  Kalends festival banishes all that is connected with toil, and allows men to 
  give themselves up to undisturbed enjoyment. From the minds of young people it 
  removes two kinds of dread: the dread of the schoolmaster and the dread of the 
  stern pedagogue. The slave also it allows, so far as possible, to breathe the 
  air of freedom.... <A NAME="page_169"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 169</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_169"></A>Another great quality of the festival is that it teaches 
  men not to hold too fast to their money, but to part with it and let it pass 
  into other hands.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-17">7-17</A><a name="Nanchor_7-17"></A> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The resemblances here to modern Christmas customs are very striking. In 
another discourse Libanius speaks of processions on the Eve of the festival. Few 
people, he says, go to bed; most go about the streets with singing and leaping 
and all sorts of mockery. The severest moralist utters no blame on this 
occasion. When morning begins to dawn they decorate their houses with laurels 
and other greenery, and at daybreak may go to bed to sleep off their 
intoxication, for many deem it necessary at this feast to follow the flowing 
bowl. On the 1st of January money is distributed to the populace; on the 2nd no 
more presents are given: it is customary to stay at home playing dice, masters 
and slaves together. On the 3rd there is racing; on the 4th the festivities 
begin to decline, but they are not altogether over on the 5th.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-18">7-18</A><a name="Nanchor_7-18"></A> </P>
<P>Another feature of the Kalends, recorded not in the pages of classical 
writers but in ecclesiastical condemnations, was the custom of dressing up in 
the hides of animals, in women's clothes, and in masks of various kinds.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-19">7-19</A><a name="Nanchor_7-19"></A> Dr. Tille&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-20">7-20</A><a name="Nanchor_7-20"></A> regards this as Italian in origin, but it seems 
likely that it was a native custom in Greece, Gaul, Germany, and other countries 
conquered by the Romans. In Greece the skin-clad mummers may have belonged to 
the winter festivals of Dionysus supplanted by the <I>Kalendae</I>.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-21">7-21</A><a name="Nanchor_7-21"></A> </P>
<P>The Church's denunciations of pagan festal practices in the winter season are 
mainly directed against the Kalends celebrations, and show into how many regions 
the keeping of the feast had spread. Complaints of its continued observance 
abound in the writings of churchmen and the decrees of councils. In the second 
volume of his &#8220;Mediaeval Stage&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-22">7-22</A><a name="Nanchor_7-22"></A> Mr. Chambers has made an interesting collection of 
forty excerpts from such denunciations, ranging in date from the fourth century 
to the eleventh, and coming from Spain, Italy, Antioch, northern Africa, 
Constantinople, Germany, England, and various districts of what is now 
France.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_170"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 170</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_170"></A>As a specimen I may translate a passage describing at some 
length the practices condemned. It is from a sermon often ascribed to St. 
Augustine of Hippo, but probably composed in the sixth century, very likely by 
Caesarius of Arles in southern Gaul:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&#8220;On those days,&#8221; says the preacher, speaking of the Kalends of January, 
  &#8220;the heathen, reversing the order of all things, dress themselves up in 
  indecent deformities.... These miserable men, and what is worse, some who have 
  been baptized, put on counterfeit forms and monstrous faces, at which one 
  should rather be ashamed and sad. For what reasonable man would believe that 
  any men in their senses would by making a stag (<I>cervulum</I>) turn 
  themselves into the appearance of animals? Some are clothed in the hides of 
  cattle; others put on the heads of beasts, rejoicing and exulting that they 
  have so transformed themselves into the shapes of animals that they no longer 
  appear to be men.... How vile, further, it is that those who have been born 
  men are clothed in women's dresses, and by the vilest change effeminate their 
  manly strength by taking on the forms of girls, blushing not to clothe their 
  warlike arms in women's garments; they have bearded faces, and yet they wish 
  to appear women.... There are some who on the Kalends of January practise 
  auguries, and do not allow fire out of their houses or any other favour to 
  anyone who asks. Also they both receive and give diabolical presents 
  (<I>strenas</I>). Some country people, moreover, lay tables with plenty of 
  things necessary for eating ... thinking that thus the Kalends of January will 
  be a warranty that all through the year their feasting will be in like measure 
  abundant. Now as for them who on those days observe any heathen customs, it is 
  to be feared that the name of Christian will avail them nought. And therefore 
  our holy fathers of old, considering that the majority of men on those days 
  became slaves to gluttony and riotous living and raved in drunkenness and 
  impious dancing, determined for the whole world that throughout the Churches a 
  public fast should be proclaimed.... Let us therefore fast, beloved brethren, 
  on those days.... For he who on the Kalends shows any civility to foolish men 
  who are wantonly sporting, is undoubtedly a partaker of their sin.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-23">7-23</A><a name="Nanchor_7-23"></A> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There are several points to be noted here. First, the zeal of the Church 
against the Kalends celebrations as impious relics of <A NAME="page_171"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 171</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_171"></A>heathenism: to root them out she even made the first three 
days of the year a solemn fast with litanies.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-24">7-24</A><a name="Nanchor_7-24"></A> Next, the particular offences should be observed. 
These are: first, the dressing up of men in the hides of animals and the clothes 
of women; next, the New Year auguries and the superstition about fire, the 
giving of presents, and the laying of tables with good things; and last, 
drunkenness and riot in general. All these we shall find fully represented in 
modern Christmas customs.</P>
<P>That Roman customs either spread to Germany, or were paralleled there, is 
shown by a curious letter written in 742 by St. Boniface to Pope Zacharias. The 
saint complained that certain Alamanni, Bavarians, and Franks refused to give up 
various heathen practices because they had seen such things done in the sacred 
city of Rome, close to St. Peter's, and, as they deemed, with the sanction of 
the clergy. On New Year's Eve, it was alleged, processions went through the 
streets of Rome, with impious songs and heathen cries; tables of fortune were 
set up, and at that time no one would lend fire or iron or any other article to 
his neighbour. The Pope replied that these things were odious to him, and should 
be so to all Christians; and next year all such practices at the January Kalends 
were formally forbidden by the Council of Rome.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-25">7-25</A><a name="Nanchor_7-25"></A> </P>
<P class=thoughtbreak>So much for Roman customs; if indeed such practices as 
beast-masking are Roman, and not derived from the religion of peoples conquered 
by the imperial legions. We must now turn to the winter festivals of the 
barbarians with whom the Church began to come into contact soon after the 
establishment of Christmas.</P>
<P>Much attention has been bestowed upon a supposed midwinter festival of the 
ancient Germans. In the mid-nineteenth century it was customary to speak of 
Christmas and the Twelve Nights as a continuation of the holy season kept by our 
forefathers at the winter solstice. The festive fires of Christmas were regarded 
as symbols of the sun, who then began his upward journey in the heavens, while 
the name Yule was traced back to the Anglo-Saxon word <I>hw&eacute;ol</I> (wheel), and 
connected with the circular <A NAME="page_172"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 172</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_172"></A>course of the sun through the wheeling-points of the 
solstices and equinoxes. More recent research, however, has thrown the gravest 
doubts upon the existence of any Teutonic festival at the winter solstice.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_82">82</A><a name="FNanchor_82"></A> It appears from philology and the study of surviving 
customs that the Teutonic peoples had no knowledge of the solstices and 
equinoxes, and until the introduction of the Roman Calendar divided their year 
not into four parts but into two, three, and six, holding their New Year's Day 
with its attendant festivities not at the end of December or beginning of 
January, but towards the middle of November. At that time in Central Europe the 
first snowfall usually occurred and the pastures were closed to the flocks. A 
great slaughter of cattle would then take place, it being impossible to keep the 
beasts in stall throughout the winter, and this time of slaughter would 
naturally be a season of feasting and sacrifice and religious observances.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_83">83</A><a name="FNanchor_83"></A>&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-26">7-26</A><a name="Nanchor_7-26"></A> </P>
<P>The Celtic year, like the Teutonic, appears to have begun in November with 
the feast of <I>Samhain</I>&#65279;&#8212;a name that may mean either &#8220;summer-end&#8221; or 
&#8220;assembly.&#8221; It appears to have been in origin a &#8220;pastoral and agricultural 
festival, which in time came to be looked upon as affording assistance to the 
powers of growth in their conflict with the powers of blight,&#8221; and to have had 
many features in common with the Teutonic feast at the same season, for instance 
animal sacrifice, commemoration of the dead, and omens and charms for the New 
Year.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-27">7-27</A><a name="Nanchor_7-27"></A> </P>
<P>There is some reason also to believe that the New Year <A NAME="page_173"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 173</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_173"></A>festival of the Slavs took place in the autumn and that its 
usages have been transferred to the feast of the Nativity.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-29">7-29</A><a name="Nanchor_7-29"></A> A description based on contemporary documents cannot 
be given of these barbarian festivals; we have, rather, to reconstruct them from 
survivals in popular custom. At the close of this book, when such relics have 
been studied, we may have gained some idea of what went on upon these 
pre-Christian holy-days. It is the Teutonic customs that have been most fully 
recorded and discussed by scholars, and these will loom largest in our review; 
at the same time Celtic and Slav practices will be considered, and we shall find 
that they often closely resemble those current in Teutonic lands.</P>
<P>The customs of the old New Year feasts have frequently wandered from their 
original November date, and to this fact we owe whatever elements of northern 
paganism are to be found in Christmas. Some practices seem to have been put 
forward to Michaelmas; one side of the festivals, the cult of the dead, is 
represented especially by All Saints&#146; and All Souls&#146; days (November 1 and 2). 
St. Martin's Day (November&nbsp;11) probably marks as nearly as possible the old 
Teutonic date, and is still in Germany an important folk-feast attended by many 
customs derived from the beginning-of-winter festival. Other practices are found 
strewn over various holy-days between Martinmas and Epiphany, and concentrated 
above all on the Church's feast of the Nativity and the Roman New Year's Day, 
January&nbsp;1, both of which had naturally great power of attraction.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-30">7-30</A><a name="Nanchor_7-30"></A> </P>
<P>The progress of agriculture, as Dr. Tille points out,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-31">7-31</A><a name="Nanchor_7-31"></A> tended to destroy the mid-November celebration. In 
the Carolingian period an improvement took place in the cultivation of meadows, 
and the increased quantity of hay made it possible to keep the animals fattening 
in stall, instead of slaughtering them as soon as the pastures were closed. Thus 
the killing-time, with its festivities, became later and later. St. Andrew's Day 
(November&nbsp;30) and St. Nicholas's (December&nbsp;6) may mark stages in its 
progress into the winter. In St. Nicholas's Day, indeed, we find a feast that 
closely resembles Martinmas, and seems to be the same folk-festival transferred 
to a later date. Again, as regards England we <A NAME="page_174"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 174</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_174"></A>must remember the difference between its climate and that 
of Central Europe. Mid-November would here not be a date beyond which pasturing 
was impossible, and thus the slaughter and feast held then by Angles and Saxons 
in their old German home would tend to be delayed.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-32">7-32</A><a name="Nanchor_7-32"></A> </P>
<P>Christmas, as will be gathered from the foregoing, cannot on its pagan side 
be separated from the folk-feasts of November and December. The meaning of the 
term will therefore here be so extended as to cover the whole period between All 
Saints&#146; Day and Epiphany. That this is not too violent a proceeding will be seen 
later on.</P>
<P>For the purposes of this book it seems best to treat the winter festivals 
calendarially, so to speak: to start at the beginning of November, and show them 
in procession, suggesting, as far as may be, the probable origins of the customs 
observed. Thus we may avoid the dismemberment caused by taking out certain 
practices from various festivals and grouping them under their probable origins, 
a method which would, moreover, be perilous in view of the very conjectural 
nature of the theories offered.</P>
<P class=thoughtbreak>Before we pass to our procession of festivals, something 
must be said about the general nature and <I>rationale</I> of the customs 
associated with them. For convenience these customs may be divided into three 
groups:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i2>I. <I>Sacrificial or Sacramental 
Practices.</I></SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>II. <I>Customs connected with the Cult 
of the Dead and the Family Hearth.</I></SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>III. <I>Omens 
and Charms for the New Year.</I></SPAN><BR></DIV></DIV>
<P>Though these three classes overlap and it is sometimes difficult to place a 
given practice exclusively in one of them, they will form a useful framework for 
a brief account of the primitive ritual which survives at the winter 
festivals.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">I. <SPAN class=smcap>Sacrificial and Sacramental Practices.</SPAN></H3>
<P>To most people, probably, the word &#8220;sacrifice&#8221; suggests an offering, 
something presented to a divinity in order to obtain his favour. Such seems to 
have been the meaning generally given to <A NAME="page_175"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 175</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_175"></A>sacrificial rites in Europe when Christianity came into 
conflict with paganism. It is, however, held by many scholars that the original 
purpose of sacrifice was sacramental&#65279;&#8212;the partaking by the worshipper of the 
divine life, conceived of as present in the victim, rather than the offering of 
a gift to a divinity.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-33">7-33</A><a name="Nanchor_7-33"></A> </P>
<P>The whole subject of sacred animals is obscure, and in regard, especially, to 
totemism&#65279;&#8212;defined by Dr. Frazer&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-34">7-34</A><a name="Nanchor_7-34"></A> as &#8220;belief in the kinship of certain families with 
certain species of animals&#8221; and practices based upon that belief&#65279;&#8212;the most 
divergent views are held by scholars. The religious significance which some have 
seen in totemistic customs is denied by others, while there is much disagreement 
as to the probability of their having been widespread in Europe. Still, whatever 
may be the truth about totemism, there is much that points to the sometime 
existence in Europe of sacrifices that were not offerings, but solemn feasts of 
communion in the flesh and blood of a worshipful animal.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-35">7-35</A><a name="Nanchor_7-35"></A> That the idea of sacrificial communion preceded the 
sacrifice-gift is suggested by the fact that in many customs which appear to be 
sacrificial survivals the body of the victim has some kind of sacramental 
efficacy; it conveys a blessing to that which is brought into contact with it. 
The actual eating and drinking of the flesh and blood is the most perfect mode 
of contact, but the same end seems to have been aimed at in such customs as the 
sprinkling of worshippers with blood, the carrying of the victim in procession 
from house to house, the burying of flesh in furrows to make the crops grow, and 
the wearing of hides, heads, or horns of sacrificed beasts.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-36">7-36</A><a name="Nanchor_7-36"></A> We shall meet, during the Christmas season, with 
various practices that seem to have originated either in a sacrificial feast or 
in some such sacramental rites as have just been described. So peculiarly 
prominent are animal masks, apparently derived from hide-, head-, and 
horn-wearing, that we may dwell upon them a little at this point.</P>
<P>We have already seen how much trouble the Kalends custom of beast-masking 
gave the ecclesiastics. Its probable origin is thus suggested by Robertson 
Smith:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&#8220;It is ... appropriate that the worshipper should dress himself in <A NAME="page_176"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 176</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_176"></A>the skin of a victim, and so, as it were, envelop himself 
  in its sanctity. To rude nations dress is not merely a physical comfort, but a 
  fixed part of social religion, a thing by which a man constantly bears on his 
  body the token of his religion, and which is itself a charm and a means of 
  divine protection.... When the dress of sacrificial skin, which at once 
  declared a man's religion and his sacred kindred, ceased to be used in 
  ordinary life, it was still retained in holy and especially in piacular 
  functions; ... examples are afforded by the Dionysiac mysteries and other 
  Greek rites, and by almost every rude religion; while in later cults the old 
  rite survives at least in the religious use of animal masks.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_84">84</A><a name="FNanchor_84"></A>&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-37">7-37</A><a name="Nanchor_7-37"></A> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If we accept the animal-worship and sacrificial communion theory, many a 
Christmas custom will carry us back in thought to a stage of religion far 
earlier than the Greek and Roman classics or the Celtic and Teutonic mythology 
of the conversion period: we shall be taken back to a time before men had come 
to have anthropomorphic gods, when they were not conscious of their superiority 
to the beasts of the field, but regarded these beings, mysterious in their 
actions, extraordinary in their powers, as incarnations of potent spirits. At 
this stage of thought, it would seem, there were as yet no definite divinities 
with personal names and characters, but the world was full of spirits immanent 
in animal or plant or chosen human being, and able to pass from one incarnation 
to another. Or indeed it may be that animal sacrifice originated at a stage of 
religion before the idea of definite &#8220;spirits&#8221; had arisen, when man was 
conscious rather of a vague force like the Melanesian <I>mana</I>, in himself 
and in almost everything, and &#8220;constantly trembling on the verge of 
personality.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-38">7-38</A><a name="Nanchor_7-38"></A> &#8220;<I>Mana</I>&nbsp;&#8221; better than &#8220;god&#8221; or &#8220;spirit&#8221; may 
express that with which the partaker in the communal feast originally sought 
contact. &#8220;When you sacrifice,&#8221; to quote some words of Miss Jane Harrison, &#8220;you 
build as it were a bridge between your <I>mana</I>, your will, your desire, 
which is weak and impotent, and <A NAME="page_177"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 177</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_177"></A>that unseen outside <I>mana</I> which you believe to be 
strong and efficacious. In the fruits of the earth which grow by some unseen 
power there is much <I>mana</I>; you want that <I>mana</I>. In the loud-roaring 
bull and the thunder is much <I>mana</I>; you want that <I>mana</I>. It would be 
well to get some, to eat a piece of that bull raw, but it is dangerous, not a 
thing to do unawares alone; so you consecrate the first-fruits, you sacrifice 
the bull and then in safety you&#65279;&#8212;communicate.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-39">7-39</A><a name="Nanchor_7-39"></A> &#8220;Sanctity&#8221;&#65279;&#8212;the quality of awfulness and 
mystery&#65279;&#8212;rather than divinity or personality, may have been what primitive man 
saw in the beasts and birds which he venerated in &#8220;their silent, aloof, goings, 
in the perfection of their limited doings.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-40">7-40</A><a name="Nanchor_7-40"></A> When we use the word &#8220;spirit&#8221; in connection with the 
pagan sacramental practices of Christmastide, it is well to bear in mind the 
possibility that at the origin of these customs there may have been no notion of 
communion with strictly personal beings, but rather some such <I>mana</I> idea 
as has been suggested above.</P>
<P>It is probable that animal-cults had their origin at a stage of human life 
preceding agriculture, when man lived not upon cultivated plants or tamed 
beasts, but upon roots and fruits and the products of the chase. Some scholars, 
indeed, hold that the domestication of animals for practical use was an outcome 
of the sacred, inviolable character of certain creatures: they may originally 
have been spared not for reasons of convenience but because it was deemed a 
crime to kill them&#65279;&#8212;except upon certain solemn occasions&#65279;&#8212;and may have become 
friendly towards man through living by his side.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-41">7-41</A><a name="Nanchor_7-41"></A> On the other hand it is possible that totems were 
originally staple articles of food, that they were sacred because they were 
eaten with satisfaction, and that the very awe and respect attached to them 
because of their life-giving powers tended to remove them from common use and 
limit their consumption to rare ceremonial occasions.</P>
<P>Closely akin to the worship of animals is that of plants, and especially 
trees, and there is much evidence pointing to sacramental cults in connection 
with the plant-world.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-42">7-42</A><a name="Nanchor_7-42"></A> Some cakes and special vegetable dishes eaten on 
festal days may be survivals of sacramental feasts parallel to those upon the 
flesh and blood of <A NAME="page_178"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 178</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_178"></A>an animal victim. Benediction by external contact, again, 
is suggested by the widespread use in various ways of branches or sprigs or 
whole trees. The Christmas-tree and evergreen decorations are the most obvious 
examples; we shall see others in the course of our survey, and in connection 
with plants as well as with animals we shall meet with processions intended to 
convey a blessing to every house by carrying about the sacred elements&#65279;&#8212;to 
borrow a term from Christian theology. Even the familiar practice of going 
carol-singing may be a Christianized form of some such perambulation.</P>
<P>It is possible that men and women had originally separate cults. The cult of 
animals, according to a theory set forth by Mr. Chambers, would at first belong 
to the men, who as hunters worshipped the beasts they slew, apologizing to them, 
as some primitive people do to-day, for the slaughter they were obliged to 
commit. Other animals, apparently, were held too sacred to be slain, except upon 
rare and solemn occasions, and hence, as we have seen, may have arisen 
domestication and the pastoral life which, with its religious rites, was the 
affair of the men. To women, on the other hand, belonged agriculture; the cult 
of Mother Earth and the vegetation-spirits seems to have been originally theirs. 
Later the two cults would coalesce, but a hint of the time when certain rites 
were practised only by women may be found in that dressing up of men in female 
garments which appears not merely in the old Kalends customs but in some modern 
survivals.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_85">85</A><a name="FNanchor_85"></A>&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-43">7-43</A><a name="Nanchor_7-43"></A> </P>
<P>Apart from any special theory of the origin of sacrifice, we may note the 
association at Christmas of physical feasting with religious rejoicing. In this 
the modern European is the heir of an agelong tradition. &#8220;Everywhere,&#8221; says 
Robertson Smith, <A NAME="page_179"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 179</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_179"></A>&#8220;we find that a sacrifice ordinarily involves a feast, and 
that a feast cannot be provided without a sacrifice. For a feast is not complete 
without flesh, and in early times the rule that all slaughter is sacrifice was 
not confined to the Semites. The identity of religious occasions and festal 
seasons may indeed be taken as the determining characteristic of the type of 
ancient religion generally; when men meet their god they feast and are glad 
together, and whenever they feast and are glad they desire that the god should 
be of the party.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-45">7-45</A><a name="Nanchor_7-45"></A> To the paganism that preceded Christianity we must 
look for the origin of that Christmas feasting which has not seldom been a 
matter of scandal for the severer type of churchman.</P>

<P>A letter addressed in 601 by Pope Gregory the Great to Abbot Mellitus, giving 
him instructions to be handed on to Augustine of Canterbury, throws a vivid 
light on the process by which heathen sacrificial feasts were turned into 
Christian festivals. &#8220;Because,&#8221; the Pope says of the Anglo-Saxons, &#8220;they are 
wont to slay many oxen in sacrifices to demons, some solemnity should be put in 
the place of this, so that on the day of the dedication of the churches, or the 
nativities of the holy martyrs whose relics are placed there, they may make for 
themselves tabernacles of branches of trees around those churches which have 
been changed from heathen temples, and may celebrate the solemnity with 
religious feasting. Nor let them now sacrifice animals to the Devil, but to the 
praise of God kill animals for their own eating, and render thanks to the Giver 
of all for their abundance; so that while some outward joys are retained for 
them, they may more readily respond to inward joys. For from obdurate minds it 
is undoubtedly impossible to cut off everything at once, because he who strives 
to ascend to the highest place rises by degrees or steps and not by leaps.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-46">7-46</A><a name="Nanchor_7-46"></A> </P>
<P>We see here very plainly the mind of the ecclesiastical compromiser. Direct 
sacrifice to heathen gods the Church of course could not dream of tolerating; it 
had been the very centre of her attack since the days of St. Paul, and refusal 
to take part in it had cost the martyrs their lives. Yet the festivity and 
merrymaking to which it gave occasion were to be left to the <A NAME="page_180"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 180</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_180"></A>people, for a time at all events. The policy had its 
advantages, it made the Church festivals popular; but it had also its dangers, 
it encouraged the intrusion of a pagan fleshly element into their austere and 
chastened joys. A certain orgiastic licence crept in, an unbridling of the 
physical appetites, which has ever been a source of sorrow and anger to the most 
earnest Christians and even led the Puritans of the seventeenth century to 
condemn all festivals as diabolical.</P>
<P>Before we leave the subject of sacrificial survivals, it must be added that 
certain Christmas customs may come, little as those who practise them suspect 
it, from that darkest of religious rites, human sacrifice. Reference has already 
been made to Dr. Frazer's view of the Saturnalian king and his awful origin. We 
shall meet with various similar figures during the Christmas season&#65279;&#8212;the &#8220;King 
of the Bean,&#8221; for instance, and the &#8220;Bishop of Fools.&#8221; If the theories about 
human sacrifice set forth in &#8220;The Golden Bough&#8221; be accepted, we may regard these 
personages as having once been mock kings chosen to suffer instead of the real 
kings, who had at first to perish by a violent death in order to preserve from 
the decay of age the divine life incarnate in them. Such mock monarchs, 
according to Dr. Frazer, were exalted for a brief season to the glory and luxury 
of kingship ere their doom fell upon them;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-47">7-47</A><a name="Nanchor_7-47"></A> in the Christmas &#8220;kings&#8221; the splendour alone has 
survived, the dark side is forgotten.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">II. <SPAN class=smcap>The Cult of the Dead and the Family 
Hearth.</SPAN></H3>
<P>Round the winter festival cluster certain customs apparently connected with 
distinctively domestic religion, rather than with such public and communal cults 
as we have considered under the heading of Sacrifice and Sacrament. A festival 
of the family&#65279;&#8212;that is, perhaps, what Christmas most prominently is to-day: it 
is the great season for gatherings &#8220;round the old fireside&#8221;; it is a joyous time 
for the children of the house, and the memory of the departed is vivid then, if 
unexpressed. Further, by the Yule log customs and certain other ceremonies still 
practised in the remoter corners of Europe, we are carried back to a stage of 
thought at which the dead were conceived as hovering about or <A NAME="page_181"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 181</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_181"></A>visiting the abodes of the living. Ancestral spirits, it 
seems, were once believed to be immanent in the fire that burned on the hearth, 
and had to be propitiated with libations, while elsewhere the souls of the dead 
were thought to return to their old homes at the New Year, and meat and drink 
had to be set out for them. The Church's establishment of All Souls&#146; Day did 
much to keep practices of tendance of the departed to early November, but 
sometimes these have wandered to later dates and especially to Christmas. In 
folk-practices directed towards the dead two tendencies are to be found: on the 
one hand affection or at all events consideration for the departed persists, and 
efforts are made to make them comfortable; on the other, they are regarded with 
dread, and the sight of them is avoided by the living.</P>
<P>In the passage quoted from Caesarius of Arles there was mention of the laying 
of tables with abundance of food at the Kalends. The same practice is condemned 
by St. Jerome in the fifth century, and is by him specially connected with 
Egypt.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-48">7-48</A><a name="Nanchor_7-48"></A> He, like Caesarius and others, regards it as a kind 
of charm to ensure abundance during the coming year, but it is very possible 
that its real purpose was different, that the food was an offering to 
supernatural beings, the guardians and representatives of the dead.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-49">7-49</A><a name="Nanchor_7-49"></A> Burchardus of Worms in the early eleventh century 
says definitely that in his time tables were laid with food and drink and three 
knives for &#8220;those three Sisters whom the ancients in their folly called 
<I>Parcae</I>.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-50">7-50</A><a name="Nanchor_7-50"></A> The <I>Parcae</I> were apparently identified with the 
three &#8220;weird&#8221; Sisters known in England and in other Teutonic regions, and seem 
to have some connection with the fairies. As we shall see later on, it is still 
in some places the custom to lay out tables for supernatural beings, whether, as 
at All Souls&#146; tide, explicitly for the dead, or for Frau Perchta, or for the 
Virgin or some other Christian figure. Possibly the name <I>Modranicht</I> 
(night of mothers), which Bede gives to Christmas Eve,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-51">7-51</A><a name="Nanchor_7-51"></A> may be connected with this practice.</P>
<P>Not remote, probably, in origin from a belief in &#8220;ghosts&#8221; is the driving away 
of spirits that sometimes takes place about <A NAME="page_182"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 182</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_182"></A>Christmas-time. Many peoples, as Dr. Frazer has shown, have 
an annual expulsion of goblins, ghosts, devils, witches, and evil influences, 
commonly at the end of the Old or beginning of the New Year. Sometimes the 
beings so driven away are definitely the spirits of the departed. An appalling 
racket and a great flare of torches are common features of these expulsions, and 
we shall meet with similar customs during the Christmas season. Such 
purifications, according to Dr. Frazer, are often preceded or followed by 
periods of licence, for when the burden of evil is about to be, or has just 
been, removed, it is felt that a little temporary freedom from moral restraints 
may be allowed with impunity.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-52">7-52</A><a name="Nanchor_7-52"></A> Hence possibly, in part, the licence which has often 
attended the Christmas season.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">III. <SPAN class=smcap>Omens and Charms for the New Year.</SPAN></H3>
<P>Customs of augury are to be met with at various dates, which may mark the 
gradual shifting of the New Year festival from early November to January&nbsp;1, 
while actual charms to secure prosperity are commonest at Christmas itself or at 
the modern New Year. Magical rather than religious in character, they are 
attempts to discover or influence the future by a sort of crude scientific 
method based on supposed analogies. Beneath the charms lie the primitive ideas 
that like produces like and that things which have once been in contact continue 
to act upon one another after they are separated in space.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-53">7-53</A><a name="Nanchor_7-53"></A> The same ideas obviously underlie many of the 
sacramental practices alluded to a few pages back, and these are often of the 
nature of charms. Probably, too, among New Year charms should be included such 
institutions as the bonfires on Hallowe'en in Celtic countries, on Guy Fawkes 
Day in England, and at Martinmas in Germany, for it would seem that they are 
intended to secure by imitation a due supply of sunshine.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-54">7-54</A><a name="Nanchor_7-54"></A> The principle that &#8220;well begun is well ended&#8221;&#65279;&#8212;or, as 
the Germans have it, &#8220;<I>Anfang gut, alles gut</I>&nbsp;&#8221;&#65279;&#8212;is fundamental in New 
Year practices: hence the custom of giving presents as auguries of wealth during 
the coming year; hence perhaps partly the heavy eating and drinking&#65279;&#8212;a kind of 
charm to ensure abundance.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_183"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 183</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_183"></A>Enough has already been said about the attitude of the 
early Church towards traditional folk-customs. Of the position taken up by the 
later mediaeval clergy we get an interesting glimpse in the &#8220;Largum Sero&#8221; of a 
certain monk Alsso of Br&#277;vnov, an account of Christmas practices in Bohemia 
written about the year 1400. It supplies a link between modern customs and the 
Kalends prohibitions of the Dark Ages. Alsso tells of a number of laudable 
Christmas Eve practices, gives elaborate Christian interpretations of them, and 
contrasts them with things done by bad Catholics with ungodly intention. Here 
are some of his complaints:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Presents, instead of being given, as they should be, in memory of God's 
  great Gift to man, are sent because he who does not give freely will be 
  unlucky in the coming year. Money, instead of being given to the poor, as is 
  seemly, is laid on the table to augur wealth, and people open their purses 
  that luck may enter. Instead of using fruit as a symbol of Christ the Precious 
  Fruit, men cut it open to predict the future [probably from the pips]. It is a 
  laudable custom to make great white loaves at Christmas as symbols of the True 
  Bread, but evil men set out such loaves that the gods may eat of 
them.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Alsso's assumption is that the bad Catholics are diabolically perverting 
venerable Christmas customs, but there can be little doubt that precisely the 
opposite was really the case&#65279;&#8212;the Christian symbolism was merely a gloss upon 
pagan practices. In one instance Alsso admits that the Church had adopted and 
transformed a heathen usage: the old <I>calendisationes</I> or processions with 
an idol Bel had been changed into processions of clergy and choir-boys with the 
crucifix. Round the villages on the Eve and during the Octave of Christmas went 
these messengers of God, robed in white raiment as befitted the servants of the 
Lord of purity; they would chant joyful anthems of the Nativity, and receive in 
return some money from the people&#65279;&#8212;they were, in fact, carol-singers. Moreover 
with their incense they would drive out the Devil from every corner.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-55">7-55</A><a name="Nanchor_7-55"></A> </P>
<P>Alsso's attitude is one of compromise, or at least many of the old heathen 
customs are allowed by him, when reinterpreted in a <A NAME="page_184"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 184</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_184"></A>Christian sense. Such seems to have been the general 
tendency of the later Catholic Church, and also of Anglicanism in so far as it 
continued the Catholic tradition. It will be seen, however, from what has 
already been said, that the English Puritans were but following early Christian 
precedents when they attacked the paganism that manifested itself at 
Christmas.</P>
<P>A strong Puritan onslaught is to be found in the &#8220;Anatomie of Abuses&#8221; by the 
Calvinist, Philip Stubbes, first published in 1583. &#8220;Especially,&#8221; he says, &#8220;in 
Christmas tyme there is nothing els vsed but cardes, dice, tables, maskyng, 
mumming, bowling, and suche like fooleries; and the reason is, that they think 
they haue a commission and prerogatiue that tyme to doe what they list, and to 
followe what vanitie they will. But (alas!) doe they thinke that they are 
preuiledged at that time to doe euill? The holier the time is (if one time were 
holier than an other, as it is not), the holier ought their exercises to bee. 
Can any tyme dispence with them, or giue them libertie to sinne? No, no; the 
soule which sinneth shall dye, at what tyme soeuer it offendeth.... 
Notwithstandyng, who knoweth not that more mischeef is that tyme committed than 
in all the yere besides?&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-56">7-56</A><a name="Nanchor_7-56"></A> </P>
<P>When the Puritans had gained the upper hand they proceeded to the suppression 
not only of abuses, but of the festival itself. An excellent opportunity for 
turning the feast into a fast&#65279;&#8212;as the early Church had done, it will be 
remembered, with the Kalends festival&#65279;&#8212;came in 1644. In that year Christmas Day 
happened to fall upon the last Wednesday of the month, a day appointed by the 
Lords and Commons for a Fast and Humiliation. In its zeal against carnal 
pleasures Parliament published the following &#8220;Ordinance for the better 
observation of the Feast of the Nativity of Christ&#8221;:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&#8220;Whereas some doubts have been raised whether the next Fast shall be 
  celebrated, because it falleth on the day which, heretofore, was usually 
  called the Feast of the Nativity of our Saviour; the lords and commons do 
  order and ordain that public notice be given, that the Fast appointed to be 
  kept on the last Wednesday in every month, ought to be observed until it be 
  otherwise ordered by both houses; <A NAME="page_185"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 185</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_185"></A>and that this day particularly is to be kept with the 
  more solemn humiliation because it may call to remembrance our sins and the 
  sins of our forefathers, who have turned this Feast, pretending the memory of 
  Christ, into an extreme forgetfulness of him, by giving liberty to carnal and 
  sensual delights; being contrary to the life which Christ himself led here 
  upon earth, and to the spiritual life of Christ in our souls; for the 
  sanctifying and saving whereof Christ was pleased both to take a human life, 
  and to lay it down again.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-57">7-57</A><a name="Nanchor_7-57"></A> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>But the English people's love of Christmas could not be destroyed. &#8220;These 
poor simple creatures are made after superstitious festivals, after unholy 
holidays,&#8221; said a speaker in the House of Commons. &#8220;I have known some that have 
preferred Christmas Day before the Lord's Day,&#8221; said Calamy in a sermon to the 
Lords in Westminster Abbey, &#8220;I have known those that would be sure to receive 
the Sacrament on Christmas Day though they did not receive it all the year 
after. This was the superstition of this day, and the profaneness was as great. 
There were some that did not play cards all the year long, yet they must play at 
Christmas.&#8221; Various protests were made against the suppression of the festival. 
Though Parliament sat every Christmas Day from 1644 to 1656, the shops in London 
in 1644 were all shut, and in 1646 the people who opened their shops were so 
roughly used that next year they petitioned Parliament to protect them in 
future. In 1647 the shops were indeed all closed, but evergreen decorations were 
put up in the City, and the Lord Mayor and City Marshal had to ride about 
setting fire to them. There were even riots in country places, notably at 
Canterbury. With the Restoration Christmas naturally came back to full 
recognition, though it may be doubted whether it has ever been quite the same 
thing since the Puritan Revolution.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_7-58">7-58</A><a name="Nanchor_7-58"></A> </P>
<P>Protestantism, in proportion to its thoroughness and the strength of its 
Puritan elements, has everywhere tended to destroy old pagan traditions and the 
festivals to which they cling. Calvinism has naturally been more destructive 
than Lutheranism, which in the Scandinavian countries has left standing many of 
the externals of Catholicism and also many Christmas customs that are purely 
pagan, while in Germany it has tolerated and even hallowed the <A NAME="page_186"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 186</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_186"></A>ritual of the Christmas-tree. But more powerful than 
religious influences, in rooting out the old customs, have been modern education 
and the growth of modern industry, breaking up the old traditional country life, 
and putting in its place the mobile, restless life of the great town. Many of 
the customs we shall have to consider belong essentially to the country, and 
have no relation to the life of the modern city. When communal in their 
character, a man could not perform them in separation from his rustic 
neighbours. Practices domestic in their purpose may indeed be transferred to the 
modern city, but it is the experience of folk-lorists that they seldom descend 
to the second generation.</P>
<P>It is in regions like Bavaria, Tyrol, Styria, or the Slav parts of the 
Austrian Empire, or Roumania and Servia, that the richest store of festival 
customs is to be found nowadays. Here the old agricultural life has been less 
interfered with, and at the same time the Church, whether Roman or Greek, has 
succeeded in keeping modern ideas away from the people and in maintaining a 
popular piety that is largely polytheistic in its worship of the saints, and 
embodies a great amount of traditional paganism. In our half-suburbanized 
England but little now remains of these vestiges of primitive religion and magic 
whose interest and importance were only realized by students in the later 
nineteenth century, when the wave of &#8220;progress&#8221; was fast sweeping them away.</P>
<P>Old traditions have a way of turning up unexpectedly in remote corners, and 
it is hard to say for certain that any custom is altogether extinct; every year, 
however, does its work of destruction, and it may well be that some of the 
practices here described in the present tense have passed into the Limbo of 
discarded things.</P>
