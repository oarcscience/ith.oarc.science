<P>It has been an instinct in nearly all peoples, savage or civilized, to set 
aside certain days for special ceremonial observances, attended by outward 
rejoicing. This tendency to concentrate on special times answers to man's need 
to lift himself above the commonplace and the everyday, to escape from the 
leaden weight of monotony that oppresses him. &#8220;We tend to tire of the most 
eternal splendours, and a mark on our calendar, or a crash of bells at midnight 
maybe, reminds us that we have only recently been created.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_1">1</A><a name="FNanchor_1"></A>&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-1">1-1</A><a name="Nanchor_1-1"></A> That they wake people up is the great justification of 
festivals, and both man's religious sense and his joy in life have generally 
tended to rise &#8220;into peaks and towers and turrets, into superhuman exceptions 
which really prove the rule.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-2">1-2</A><a name="Nanchor_1-2"></A> It is difficult to be religious, impossible to be 
merry, at every moment of life, and festivals are as sunlit peaks, testifying, 
above dark valleys, to the eternal radiance. This is one view of the purpose and 
value of festivals, and their function of cheering people and giving them larger 
perspectives has no doubt been an important reason for their maintenance in the 
past. If we could trace the custom of festival-keeping back to its origins in 
primitive society <A NAME="page_18"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 18</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_18"></A>we should find the same principle of specialization involved, 
though it is probable that the practice came into being not for the sake of its 
moral or emotional effect, but from man's desire to lay up, so to speak, a stock 
of sanctity, magical not ethical, for ordinary days.</P>
<P>The first holy-day-makers were probably more concerned with such material 
goods as food than with spiritual ideals, when they marked with sacred days the 
rhythm of the seasons.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-3">1-3</A><a name="Nanchor_1-3"></A> As man's consciousness developed, the subjective aspect 
of the matter would come increasingly into prominence, until in the festivals of 
the Christian Church the main object is to quicken the devotion of the believer 
by contemplation of the mysteries of the faith. Yet attached, as we shall see, 
to many Christian festivals, are old notions of magical sanctity, probably quite 
as potent in the minds of the common people as the more spiritual ideas 
suggested by the Church's feasts.</P>
<P>In modern England we have almost lost the festival habit, but if there is one 
feast that survives among us as a universal tradition it is Christmas. We have 
indeed our Bank Holidays, but they are mere days of rest and amusement, and for 
the mass of the people Easter and Whitsuntide have small religious 
significance&#65279;&#8212;Christmas alone has the character of sanctity which marks the true 
festival. The celebration of Christmas has often little or nothing to do with 
orthodox dogma, yet somehow the sense of obligation to keep the feast is very 
strong, and there are few English people, however unconventional, who escape 
altogether the spell of tradition in this matter.</P>
<P><I>Christmas</I>&#65279;&#8212;how many images the word calls up: we think of 
carol-singers and holly-decked churches where people hymn in time-honoured 
strains the Birth of the Divine Child; of frost and snow, and, in contrast, of 
warm hearths and homes bright with light and colour, very fortresses against the 
cold; of feasting and revelry, of greetings and gifts exchanged; and lastly of 
vaguely superstitious customs, relics of long ago, performed perhaps out of 
respect for use and wont, or merely in jest, or with a deliberate attempt to 
throw ourselves back into the past, to re-enter for a moment the mental 
childhood of the race. These are a few of <A NAME="page_19"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 19</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_19"></A>the pictures that rise pell-mell in the minds of English folk 
at the mention of Christmas; how many other scenes would come before us if we 
could realize what the festival means to men of other nations. Yet even these 
will suggest what hardly needs saying, that Christmas is something far more 
complex than a Church holy-day alone, that the celebration of the Birth of 
Jesus, deep and touching as is its appeal to those who hold the faith of the 
Incarnation, is but one of many elements that have entered into the great winter 
festival.</P>
<P>In the following pages I shall try to present a picture, sketchy and 
inadequate though it must be, of what Christmas is and has been to the peoples 
of Europe, and to show as far as possible the various elements that have gone 
into its make-up. Most people have a vague impression that these are largely 
pagan, but comparatively few have any idea of the process by which the heathen 
elements have become mingled with that which is obviously Christian, and equal 
obscurity prevails as to the nature and meaning of the non-Christian customs. 
The subject is vast, and has not been thoroughly explored as yet, but the 
labours of historians and folk-lorists have made certain conclusions probable, 
and have produced hypotheses of great interest and fascination.</P>
<P>I have spoken of &#8220;Christian&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_2">2</A><a name="FNanchor_2"></A> and &#8220;pagan&#8221; elements. The distinction is blurred to some 
extent by the clothing of heathen customs in a superficial Christianity, but on 
the whole it is clear enough to justify the division of this book into two 
parts, one dealing with the Church's feast of the Holy Birth, the other with 
those remains of pagan winter festivals which extend from November to January, 
but cluster especially round Christmas and the Twelve Days.</P>
<P class=thoughtbreak>Before we pass to the various aspects of the Church's 
Christmas, we must briefly consider its origins and its relation to certain <A NAME="page_20"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 20</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_20"></A>pagan festivals, the customs of which will be dealt with in 
detail in Part II.</P>
<P>The names given to the feast by different European peoples throw a certain 
amount of light on its history. Let us take five of them&#65279;&#8212;<I>Christmas</I>, 
<I>Weihnacht</I>, <I>No&euml;l</I>, <I>Calendas</I>, and <I>Yule</I>&#65279;&#8212;and see what 
they suggest.</P>
<P>I. The English <I>Christmas</I> and its Dutch equivalent <I>Kerstmisse</I>, 
plainly point to the ecclesiastical side of the festival; the German 
<I>Weihnacht</I>&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-4">1-4</A><a name="Nanchor_1-4"></A> (sacred night) is vaguer, and might well be either 
pagan or Christian; in point of fact it seems to be Christian, since it does not 
appear till the year 1000, when the Faith was well established in Germany.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-5">1-5</A><a name="Nanchor_1-5"></A> <I>Christmas</I> and <I>Weihnacht</I>, then, may stand 
for the distinctively Christian festival, the history of which we may now 
briefly study.</P>
<P>When and where did the keeping of Christmas begin? Many details of its early 
history remain in uncertainty, but it is fairly clear that the earliest 
celebration of the Birth of Christ on December&nbsp;25 took place at Rome about 
the middle of the fourth century, and that the observance of the day spread from 
the western to the eastern Church, which had before been wont to keep 
January&nbsp;6 as a joint commemoration of the Nativity and the Baptism of the 
Redeemer.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_3">3</A><a name="FNanchor_3"></A></P>
<P>The first mention of a Nativity feast on December&nbsp;25 is found in a Roman 
document known as the Philocalian Calendar, dating from the year 354, but 
embodying an older document evidently belonging to the year 336. It is uncertain 
to which date the Nativity reference belongs;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_4">4</A><a name="FNanchor_4"></A> but further back than 336 at all events the festival 
cannot be traced.</P>
<P>From Rome, Christmas spread throughout the West, with the <A NAME="page_21"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 21</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_21"></A>conversion of the barbarians. Whether it came to England 
through the Celtic Church is uncertain, but St. Augustine certainly brought it 
with him, and Christmas Day, 598, witnessed a great event, the baptism of more 
than ten thousand English converts.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-9">1-9</A><a name="Nanchor_1-9"></A> In 567 the Council of Tours had declared the Twelve 
Days, from Christmas to Epiphany, a festal tide;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-10">1-10</A><a name="Nanchor_1-10"></A> the laws of Ethelred (991-1016) ordained it to be a 
time of peace and concord among Christian men, when all strife must cease.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-11">1-11</A><a name="Nanchor_1-11"></A> In Germany Christmas was established by the Synod of 
Mainz in 813;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-12">1-12</A><a name="Nanchor_1-12"></A> in Norway by King Hakon the Good about the middle of 
the tenth century.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-13">1-13</A><a name="Nanchor_1-13"></A> </P>
<P>In the East, as has been seen, the Birth of the Redeemer was at first 
celebrated not on December&nbsp;25, but on January&nbsp;6, the feast of the 
Epiphany or manifestation of Christ's glory. The Epiphany can be traced as far 
back as the second century, among the Basilidian heretics, from whom it may have 
spread to the Catholic Church. It was with them certainly a feast of the 
Baptism, and possibly also of the Nativity, of Christ. The origins of the 
Epiphany festival&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-14">1-14</A><a name="Nanchor_1-14"></A> are very obscure, nor can we say with certainty what 
was its meaning at first. It may be that it took the place of a heathen rite 
celebrating the birth of the World or &AElig;on from the Virgin on January&nbsp;6.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_5">5</A><a name="FNanchor_5"></A> At all events one of its objects was to commemorate the 
Baptism, the appearance of the Holy Dove, and the Voice from heaven, &#8220;Thou art 
my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased&#8221; (or, as other MSS. read, &#8220;This day 
have I begotten thee&#8221;).</P>
<P><A NAME="page_22"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 22</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_22"></A>In some circles of early Christianity the Baptism appears to 
have been looked upon as the true Birth of Christ, the moment when, filled by 
the Spirit, He became Son of God; and the carnal Birth was regarded as of 
comparatively little significance. Hence the Baptism festival may have arisen 
first, and the celebration of the Birth at Bethlehem may have been later 
attached to the same day, partly perhaps because a passage in St. Luke's Gospel 
was supposed to imply that Jesus was baptized on His thirtieth birthday. As 
however the orthodox belief became more sharply defined, increasing stress was 
laid on the Incarnation of God in Christ in the Virgin's womb, and it may have 
been felt that the celebration of the Birth and the Baptism on the same day 
encouraged heretical views. Hence very likely the introduction of Christmas on 
December&nbsp;25 as a festival of the Birth alone. In the East the 
concelebration of the two events continued for some time after Rome had 
instituted the separate feast of Christmas. Gradually, however, the Roman use 
spread: at Constantinople it was introduced about 380 by the great theologian, 
Gregory Nazianzen; at Antioch it appeared in 388, at Alexandria in 432. The 
Church of Jerusalem long stood out, refusing to adopt the new feast till the 
seventh century, it would seem.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-18">1-18</A><a name="Nanchor_1-18"></A> One important Church, the Armenian, knows nothing of 
December&nbsp;25, and still celebrates the Nativity with the Epiphany on 
January&nbsp;6.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-19">1-19</A><a name="Nanchor_1-19"></A> Epiphany in the eastern Orthodox Church has lost its 
connection with the Nativity and is now chiefly a celebration of the Baptism of 
Christ, while in the West, as every one knows, it is primarily a celebration of 
the Adoration by the Magi, an event commemorated by the Greeks on Christmas Day. 
Epiphany is, however, as we shall see, a greater festival in the Greek Church 
than Christmas.</P>
<P>Such in bare outline is the story of the spread of Christmas as an 
independent festival. Its establishment fitly followed the triumph of the 
Catholic doctrine of the perfect Godhead or Christ at the Council of Nicea in 
325.</P>
<P>II. The French <I>No&euml;l</I> is a name concerning whose origin there has been 
considerable dispute; there can, however, be little doubt that it is the same 
word as the Proven&ccedil;al <I>Nadau</I> or <I>Nadal</I>, <A NAME="page_23"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 23</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_23"></A>the Italian <I>Natale</I>, and the Welsh <I>Nadolig</I>, all 
obviously derived from the Latin <I>natalis</I>, and meaning &#8220;birthday.&#8221; One 
naturally takes this as referring to the Birth of Christ, but it may at any rate 
remind us of another birthday celebrated on the same date by the Romans of the 
Empire, that of the unconquered Sun, who on December&nbsp;25, the winter 
solstice according to the Julian calendar, began to rise to new vigour after his 
autumnal decline.</P>
<P>Why, we may ask, did the Church choose December&nbsp;25 for the celebration 
of her Founder's Birth? No one now imagines that the date is supported by a 
reliable tradition; it is only one of various guesses of early Christian 
writers. As a learned eighteenth-century Jesuit&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-20">1-20</A><a name="Nanchor_1-20"></A> has pointed out, there is not a single month in the 
year to which the Nativity has not been assigned by some writer or other. The 
real reason for the choice of the day most probably was, that upon it fell the 
pagan festival just mentioned.</P>
<P>The <I>Dies Natalis Invicti</I> was probably first celebrated in Rome by 
order of the Emperor Aurelian (270-5), an ardent worshipper of the Syrian 
sun-god Baal.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-21">1-21</A><a name="Nanchor_1-21"></A> With the <I>Sol Invictus</I> was identified the 
figure of Mithra, that strange eastern god whose cult resembled in so many ways 
the worship of Jesus, and who was at one time a serious rival of the Christ in 
the minds of thoughtful men.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_6">6</A><a name="FNanchor_6"></A>&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-22">1-22</A><a name="Nanchor_1-22"></A> It was the sun-god, poetically and philosophically 
conceived, whom the Emperor Julian made the centre of his ill-fated revival of 
paganism, and there is extant a fine prayer of his to &#8220;King Sun.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-23">1-23</A><a name="Nanchor_1-23"></A> </P>
<P>What more natural than that the Church should choose this day to celebrate 
the rising of her Sun of Righteousness with healing in His wings, that she 
should strive thus to draw away to His worship some adorers of the god whose 
symbol and representative was the earthly sun! There is no direct evidence of 
deliberate substitution, but at all events ecclesiastical writers soon after the 
foundation of Christmas made good use of the idea <A NAME="page_24"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 24</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_24"></A>that the birthday of the Saviour had replaced the birthday of 
the sun.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_7">7</A><a name="FNanchor_7"></A></P>
<P>Little is known of the manner in which the <I>Natalis Invicti</I> was kept; 
it was not a folk-festival, and was probably observed by the classes rather than 
the masses.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-24">1-24</A><a name="Nanchor_1-24"></A> Its direct influence on Christmas customs has 
probably been little or nothing. It fell, however, just before a Roman festival 
that had immense popularity, is of great importance for our subject, and is 
recalled by another name for Christmas that must now be considered.</P>
<P>III. The Proven&ccedil;al <I>Calendas</I> or <I>Calenos</I>, the Polish 
<I>Kolenda</I>, the Russian <I>Koly&aacute;da</I>, the Czech <I>Koleda</I> and the 
Lithuanian <I>Kalledos</I>, not to speak of the Welsh <I>Calenig</I> for 
Christmas-box, and the Gaelic <I>Calluinn</I> for New Year's Eve, are all 
derived from the Latin <I>Kalendae</I>, and suggest the connection of Christmas 
with the Roman New Year's Day, the Kalends or the first day of January, a time 
celebrated with many festive customs. What these were, and how they have 
affected Christmas we shall see in some detail in Part II.; suffice it to say 
here that the festival, which lasted for at least three days, was one of riotous 
life, of banqueting and games and licence. It was preceded, moreover, by the 
<I>Saturnalia</I> (December&nbsp;17 to 23) which had many like features, and 
must have formed practically one festive season with it. The word 
<I>Saturnalia</I> has become so familiar in modern usage as to suggest 
sufficiently the character of the festival for which it stands.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_25"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 25</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_25"></A>Into the midst of this season of revelry and licence the 
Church introduced her celebration of the beginning of man's redemption from the 
bondage of sin. Who can wonder that Christmas contains incongruous elements, for 
old things, loved by the people, cannot easily be uprooted.</P>
<P>IV. One more name yet remains to be considered, <I>Yule</I> (Danish 
<I>Jul</I>), the ordinary word for Christmas in the Scandinavian languages, and 
not extinct among ourselves. Its derivation has been widely discussed, but so 
far no satisfactory explanation of it has been found. Professor Skeat in the 
last edition of his Etymological Dictionary (1910) has to admit that its origin 
is unknown. Whatever its source may be, it is clearly the name of a Germanic 
season&#65279;&#8212;probably a two-month tide covering the second half of November, the 
whole of December, and the first half of January.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-26">1-26</A><a name="Nanchor_1-26"></A> It may well suggest to us the element added to 
Christmas by the barbarian peoples who began to learn Christianity about the 
time when the festival was founded. Modern research has tended to disprove the 
idea that the old Germans held a Yule feast at the winter solstice, and it is 
probable, as we shall see, that the specifically Teutonic Christmas customs come 
from a New Year and beginning-of-winter festival kept about the middle of 
November. These customs transferred to Christmas are to a great extent religious 
or magical rites intended to secure prosperity during the coming year, and there 
is also the familiar Christmas feasting, apparently derived in part from the 
sacrificial banquets that marked the beginning of winter.</P>
<P class=thoughtbreak>We have now taken a general glance at the elements which 
have combined in Christmas. The heathen folk-festivals absorbed by the Nativity 
feast were essentially life-affirming, they expressed the mind of men who said 
&#8220;yes&#8221; to this life, who valued earthly good things. On the other hand 
Christianity, at all events in its intensest form, the religion of the monks, 
was at bottom pessimistic as regards this earth, and valued it only as a place 
of discipline for the life to come; it was essentially a religion of 
renunciation that said &#8220;no&#8221; to the world. The <A NAME="page_26"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 26</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_26"></A>Christian had here no continuing city, but sought one to 
come. How could the Church make a feast of the secular New Year; what mattered 
to her the world of time? her eye was fixed upon the eternal realities&#65279;&#8212;the 
great drama of Redemption. Not upon the course of the temporal sun through the 
zodiac, but upon the mystical progress of the eternal Sun of Righteousness must 
she base her calendar. Christmas and New Year's Day&#65279;&#8212;the two festivals stood 
originally for the most opposed of principles.</P>
<P>Naturally the Church fought bitterly against the observance of the Kalends; 
she condemned repeatedly the unseemly doings of Christians in joining in 
heathenish customs at that season; she tried to make the first of January a 
solemn fast; and from the ascetic point of view she was profoundly right, for 
the old festivals were bound up with a lusty attitude towards the world, a 
seeking for earthly joy and well-being.</P>
<P>The struggle between the ascetic principle of self-mortification, 
world-renunciation, absorption in a transcendent ideal, and the natural human 
striving towards earthly joy and well-being, is, perhaps, the most interesting 
aspect of the history of Christianity; it is certainly shown in an absorbingly 
interesting way in the development of the Christian feast of the Nativity. The 
conflict is keen at first; the Church authorities fight tooth and nail against 
these relics of heathenism, these devilish rites; but mankind's instinctive 
paganism is insuppressible, the practices continue as ritual, though losing much 
of their meaning, and the Church, weary of denouncing, comes to wink at them, 
while the pagan joy in earthly life begins to colour her own festival.</P>
<P>The Church's Christmas, as the Middle Ages pass on, becomes increasingly 
&#8220;merry&#8221;&#65279;&#8212;warm and homely, suited to the instincts of ordinary humanity, filled 
with a joy that is of this earth, and not only a mystical rapture at a 
transcendental Redemption. The Incarnate God becomes a real child to be fondled 
and rocked, a child who is the loveliest of infants, whose birthday is the 
supreme type of all human birthdays, and may be kept with feasting and dance and 
song. Such is the Christmas of popular tradition, the Nativity as it is 
reflected in the carols, the cradle-rocking, the mystery plays of the later 
Middle Ages. This <A NAME="page_27"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 27</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_27"></A>Christmas, which still lingers, though maimed, in some 
Catholic regions, is strongly life-affirming; the value and delight of earthly, 
material things is keenly felt; sometimes, even, it passes into coarseness and 
riot. Yet a certain mysticism usually penetrates it, with hints that this dear 
life, this fair world, are not all, for the soul has immortal longings in her. 
Nearly always there is the spirit of reverence, of bowing down before the Infant 
God, a visitor from the supernatural world, though bone of man's bone, flesh of 
his flesh. Heaven and earth have met together; the rough stable is become the 
palace of the Great King.</P>
<P>This we might well call the &#8220;Catholic&#8221; Christmas, the Christmas of the age 
when the Church most nearly answered to the needs of the whole man, spiritual 
and sensuous. The Reformation in England and Germany did not totally destroy it; 
in England the carol-singers kept up for a while the old spirit; in Lutheran 
Germany a highly coloured and surprisingly sensuous celebration of the Nativity 
lingered on into the eighteenth century. In the countries that remained Roman 
Catholic much of the old Christmas continued, though the spirit of the 
Counter-Reformation, faced by the challenge of Protestantism, made for greater 
&#8220;respectability,&#8221; and often robbed the Catholic Christmas of its humour, its 
homeliness, its truly popular stamp, substituting pretentiousness for 
simplicity, sugary sentiment for na&iuml;ve and genuine poetry.</P>
<P>Apart from the transformation of the Church's Christmas from something 
austere and metaphysical into something joyous and human, warm and kindly, we 
shall note in our Second Part the survival of much that is purely pagan, 
continuing alongside of the celebration of the Nativity, and often little 
touched by its influence. But first we must consider the side of the festival 
suggested by the English and French names: <I>Christmas</I> will stand for the 
liturgical rites commemorating the wonder of the Incarnation&#65279;&#8212;God in man made 
manifest&#65279;&#8212;<I>No&euml;l</I> or &#8220;the Birthday,&#8221; for the ways in which men have striven 
to realize the human aspect of the great Coming.</P>
<P>How can we reach the inner meaning of the Nativity feast, its significance 
for the faithful? Better, perhaps, by the way of <A NAME="page_28"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 28</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_28"></A>poetry than by the way of ritual, for it is poetry that 
reveals the emotions at the back of the outward observances, and we shall 
understand these better when the singers of Christmas have laid bare to us their 
hearts. We may therefore first give attention to the Christmas poetry of sundry 
ages and peoples, and then go on to consider the liturgical and popular ritual 
in which the Church has striven to express her joy at the Redeemer's birth. 
Ceremonial, of course, has always mimetic tendencies, and in a further chapter 
we shall see how these issued in genuine drama; how, in the miracle plays, the 
Christmas story was represented by the forms and voices of living men.</P>
