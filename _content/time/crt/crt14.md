The peoples of Europe have various centres for their Christmas
rejoicing. In Spain and Italy the crib is often the focus of the
festival in the home as well as the church. In England﻿—after the old
tradition﻿—, in rural France, and among the southern Slavs, the centre
is the great log solemnly brought in and kindled on the hearth, while in
Germany, one need hardly say, the light-laden tree is the supreme symbol
of Christmas. The crib has already been treated in our First Part, the
Yule log and the Christmas-tree will be considered in this chapter and
the next.

The log placed on the fire on the Vigil of the Nativity no longer forms
an important part of the English Christmas. Yet within the memory of
many it was a very essential element in the celebration of the festival,
not merely as giving out welcome warmth in the midwinter cold, but as
possessing occult, magical properties. In some remote corners of England
it probably lingers yet. We shall return to the traditional English Yule
log after a study of some Continental customs of the same kind.

First, we may travel to a part of eastern Europe where the log
ceremonies are found in their most elaborate form. Among the Serbs and
Croats on Christmas Eve two or three young oaks are felled for every
house, and, as twilight comes on, are brought in and laid on the fire.
(Sometimes there is one for each male <span id="page_252">p.
252</span> <span id="Page_252"></span>member of the family, but one
large log is the centre of the ritual.) The felling takes place in some
districts before sunrise, corn being thrown upon the trees with the
words, “Good morning, Christmas!” At Risano and other places in Lower
Dalmatia the women and girls wind red silk and gold wire round the oak
trunks, and adorn them with leaves and flowers. While they are being
carried into the house lighted tapers are held on either side of the
door. As the house-father crosses the threshold in the twilight with the
first log, corn﻿—or in some places wine﻿—is thrown over him by one of
the family. The log or *badnjak* is then placed on the fire. At Ragusa
the house-father sprinkles corn and wine upon the *badnjak*, saying, as
the flame shoots up, “Goodly be thy birth!” In the mountains above
Risano he not only pours corn and wine but afterwards takes a bowl of
corn, an orange, and a ploughshare, and places them on the upper end of
the log in order that the corn may grow well and the beasts be healthy
during the year. In Montenegro, instead of throwing corn, he more
usually breaks a piece of unleavened bread, places it upon the log, and
pours over it a libation of wine.﻿ [11-1](crt22.htm#Note_11-1)<span
id="Nanchor_11-1"></span>

The first visit on Christmas Day is considered important﻿—we may compare
this with “first-footing” in the British Isles on January 1﻿—and in
order that the right sort of person may come, some one is specially
chosen to be the so-called *polaznik*. No outsider but this *polaznik*
may enter a house on Christmas Day, where the rites are strictly
observed. He appears in the early morning, carries corn in his glove and
shakes it out before the threshold with the words, “Christ is born,”
whereupon some member of the household sprinkles him with corn in
return, answering, “He is born indeed.” Afterwards the *polaznik* goes
to the fire and makes sparks fly from the remains of the *badnjak*, at
the same time uttering a wish for the good luck of the house-father and
his household and farm. Money and sometimes an orange are then placed on
the *badnjak*. It is not allowed to burn quite away; the last remains of
the fire are extinguished and the embers are laid between the branches
of young fruit-trees to promote their
growth.﻿ [11-2](crt22.htm#Note_11-2)<span id="Nanchor_11-2"></span>

How shall we interpret these practices? Mannhardt regards the log as an
embodiment of the vegetation-spirit, and its burning <span
id="page_253">p. 253</span> <span id="Page_253"></span>as an efficacious
symbol of sunshine, meant to secure the genial vitalizing influence of
the sun during the coming year.﻿ [11-3](crt22.htm#Note_11-3)<span
id="Nanchor_11-3"></span> It is, however, possible to connect it with a
different circle of ideas and to see in its burning the solemn annual
rekindling of the sacred hearth-fire, the centre of the family life and
the dwelling-place of the ancestors. Primitive peoples in many parts of
the world are accustomed to associate fire with human
generation,﻿ [11-4](crt22.htm#Note_11-4)<span id="Nanchor_11-4"></span>
and it is a general belief among Aryan and other peoples that ancestral
spirits have their seat in the hearth. In Russia, for instance, “in the
Nijegorod Government it is still forbidden to break up the smouldering
faggots in a stove, because to do so might cause the ancestors to fall
through into hell. And when a Russian family moves from one house to
another, the fire is conveyed to the new one, where it is received with
the words, ‘Welcome, grandfather, to the new
home!’”﻿ [11-5](crt22.htm#Note_11-5)<span id="Nanchor_11-5"></span>

Sir Arthur Evans in three articles in *Macmillan's Magazine* for
1881﻿ [11-6](crt22.htm#Note_11-6)<span id="Nanchor_11-6"></span> gave a
minute account of the Christmas customs of the Serbian highlanders above
Risano, who practise the log-rites with elaborate ceremonial, and
explained them as connected in one way or other with ancestor-worship,
though the people themselves attach a Christian meaning to many of them.
He pointed to the following facts as showing that the Serbian Christmas
is at bottom a feast of the dead:﻿—(1) It is said on Christmas Eve,
“To-night Earth is blended with Paradise” \[*Raj*, the abode of the dead
among the heathen Slavs\]. (2) There is talk of unchristened folk
beneath the threshold wailing “for a wax-light and offerings to be
brought them; when that is done they lie still enough”﻿—here there may
be a modified survival of the idea that ancestral spirits dwell beneath
the doorway. (3) The food must on no account be cleared away after the
Christmas meal, but is left for three days, apparently for the
house-spirits. (4) Blessings are invoked upon the “Absent Ones,” which
seems to mean the departed, and (5) a toast is drunk and a bread-cake
broken in memory of “the Patron Namegiver of all house-fathers,”
ostensibly Christ but perhaps originally the founder of the family. Some
of these customs resemble those we have noted on All Souls’ Eve and﻿—in
Scandinavia﻿—on Christmas Eve; other parallels we shall meet <span
id="page_254">p. 254</span> <span id="Page_254"></span>with later. Among
the Slav races the old organization of the family under an elective
house-elder and holding things in common has been faithfully preserved,
and we might expect to find among the remote Serbian highlanders
specially clear traces of the old religion of the hearth. One remarkable
point noted by Sir Arthur Evans was that in the Crivoscian cottage where
he stayed the fire-irons, the table, and the stools were removed to an
obscure corner before the logs were brought in and the Christmas rites
began﻿—an indication apparently of the extreme antiquity of the
celebration, as dating from a time when such implements were
unknown.﻿ [11-7](crt22.htm#Note_11-7)<span id="Nanchor_11-7"></span>

If we take the view that ancestral spirits are the centre of the
*badnjak* observances, we may regard the libations upon the fire as
intended for their benefit. On the sun and vegetation hypothesis,
however, the libations would be meant to secure, by homoeopathic magic,
that sunshine should alternate with the rain necessary for the welfare
of plants.﻿ [99](crt24.htm#Footnote_99)<span
id="FNanchor_99"></span>﻿ [11-8](crt22.htm#Note_11-8)<span
id="Nanchor_11-8"></span> The fertilizing powers possessed by the sparks
and ashes of the Christmas log appear frequently in folk-lore, and may
be explained either by the connection of fire with human generation
already noted, or, on the other theory, by the burning log being a sort
of sacrament of sunshine. It is not perhaps necessary to exclude the
idea of the log's connection with the vegetation-spirit even on the
ancestral cult hypothesis, for the tree which furnished the fuel may
have been regarded as the source of the life of the
race.﻿ [11-9](crt22.htm#Note_11-9)<span id="Nanchor_11-9"></span> The
Serbian rites certainly suggest very strongly some sort of veneration
for the log itself as well as for the fire that it feeds.

We may now return to western Europe. In France the Christmas log or
*souche de Noël* is common in the less modernized places, particularly
in the south. In Dauphiné it is called *chalendal*, <span
id="page_255">p. 255</span> <span id="Page_255"></span>in Provence
*calignaou* (from *Kalendae*, of course) or *tréfoir*, in Orne
*tréfouet*. On Christmas Eve in Provence the whole family goes solemnly
out to bring in the log. A carol meanwhile is sung praying for blessings
on the house, that the women may bear children, the nanny-goats kids,
and the ewes lambs, that corn and flour may abound, and the cask be full
of wine. Then the youngest child in the family pours wine on the log in
the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. The log is then thrown upon
the fire, and the charcoal is kept all the year and used as a remedy for
various ills.﻿ [11-11](crt22.htm#Note_11-11)<span
id="Nanchor_11-11"></span>

Another account is given in his Memoirs by Frédéric Mistral, the
Provençal poet. On Christmas Eve everyone, he says, speaking of his
boyhood, sallied forth to fetch the Yule log, which had to be cut from a
fruit-tree:﻿—

> “Walking in line we bore it home, headed by the oldest at one end, and
> I, the last born, bringing up the rear. Three times we made the tour
> of the kitchen, then, arrived at the flagstones of the hearth, my
> father solemnly poured over the log a glass of wine, with the
> dedicatory words:
>
> ‘Joy, joy. May God shower joy upon us, my dear children. Christmas
> brings us all good things. God give us grace to see the New Year, and
> if we do not increase in numbers may we at all events not decrease.’
>
> In chorus we responded:
>
> ‘Joy, joy, joy!’ and lifted the log on the fire dogs. Then as the
> first flame leapt up my father would cross himself, saying, ‘Burn the
> log, O fire,’ and with that we all sat down to the
> table.”﻿ [11-12](crt22.htm#Note_11-12)<span id="Nanchor_11-12"></span>

In some places the *tréfoir* or *tison de Noël* is burnt every evening
during the Thirteen Nights. If put under the bed its charcoal protects
the house all the year round from lightning; contact with it preserves
people from chilblains and animals from various diseases; mixed with
fodder it makes cows calve; its brands thrown into the soil keep the
corn healthy. In Périgord the portion which has not been burnt is used
to form part of a plough, and is believed to make the seed prosper;
women also keep some fragments until Epiphany that their poultry may
thrive.﻿ [11-13](crt22.htm#Note_11-13)<span id="Nanchor_11-13"></span>
In <span id="page_256">p. 256</span> <span id="Page_256"></span>Brittany
the *tison* is a protection against lightning and its ashes are put in
wells to keep the water good.﻿ [11-14](crt22.htm#Note_11-14)<span
id="Nanchor_11-14"></span>

In northern Italy also the *ceppo* or log is (or was) known﻿—the
Piedmontese call it *suc*﻿—and in Tuscany Christmas is called after it
*Festa di Ceppo*. In the Val di Chiana on Christmas Eve the family
gathers, a great log is set on the fire, the children are blindfolded
and have to beat it with tongs, and an *Ave Maria del Ceppo* is
sung.﻿ [11-15](crt22.htm#Note_11-15)<span id="Nanchor_11-15"></span>
Under the name in Lombardy of *zocco*, in Tuscany of *ciocco*, *di
Natale*, the Yule log was in olden times common in Italian cities; the
custom can there be traced back to the eleventh century. A little book
probably printed in Milan at the end of the fifteenth century gives
minute particulars of the ritual observed, and we learn that on
Christmas Eve the father, or the head of the household, used to call all
the family together and with great devotion, in the name of the Holy
Trinity, take the log and place it on the fire. Juniper was put under
it, and on the top money was placed, afterwards to be given to the
servants. Wine in abundance was poured three times on the fire when the
head of the house had drunk and given drink to all present. It was an
old Italian custom to preserve the ashes of the *zocco* as a protection
against hail. A modern superstition is to keep some splinters of the
wood and burn them in the fires made for the benefit of silkworms; so
burnt, they are supposed to keep ills away from the
creatures.﻿ [11-16](crt22.htm#Note_11-16)<span
id="Nanchor_11-16"></span>

In many parts of Germany Yule log customs can be traced. In Hesse and
Westphalia, for instance, it was the custom on Christmas Eve or Day to
lay a large block of wood on the fire and, as soon as it was charred a
little, to take it off and preserve it. When a storm threatened, it was
kindled again as a protection against lightning. It was called the
*Christbrand*.﻿ [11-17](crt22.htm#Note_11-17)<span
id="Nanchor_11-17"></span> In Thuringia a *Christklotz* (Christ log) is
put on the fire before people go to bed, so that it may burn all through
the night. Its remains are kept to protect the house from fire and
ill-luck. In parts of Thuringia and in Mecklenburg, Pomerania, East
Prussia, Saxony, and Bohemia, the fire is kept up all night on Christmas
or New Year's Eve, and the ashes are used to rid cattle of vermin and
protect plants and fruit-trees from insects, while in the country
between the Sieg <span id="page_257">p. 257</span> <span
id="Page_257"></span>and Lahn the powdered ashes of an oaken log are
strewn during the Thirteen Nights on the fields, to increase their
fertility.﻿ [11-18](crt22.htm#Note_11-18)<span
id="Nanchor_11-18"></span> In Sweden, too, some form of Yule log was
known,﻿ [11-19](crt22.htm#Note_11-19)<span id="Nanchor_11-19"></span>
and in Greece, as we have seen, the burning of a log is still supposed
to be a protection against *Kallikantzaroi*.

As for the English customs, they can hardly be better introduced than in
Herrick's words:﻿—

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">“Come, bring, with a noise,</span>  
<span class="i3">My merry, merry boys,</span>  
<span class="i2">The Christmas Log to the firing:</span>  
<span class="i3">While my good Dame she</span>  
<span class="i3">Bids ye all be free,</span>  
<span class="i2">And drink to your hearts’ desiring.</span>  

</div>

<div class="stanza">

<span class="i3">With the last year's Brand</span>  
<span class="i3">Light the new Block, and</span>  
<span class="i2">For good success in his spending,</span>  
<span class="i3">On your psaltries play,</span>  
<span class="i3">That sweet luck may</span>  
<span class="i2">Come while the log is
a-teending.”﻿ [100](crt24.htm#Footnote_100)<span
id="FNanchor_100"></span>﻿ [11-20](crt22.htm#Note_11-20)<span
id="Nanchor_11-20"></span> </span>  

</div>

</div>

We may note especially that the block must be kindled with last year's
brand; here there is a distinct suggestion that the lighting of the log
at Christmas is a shrunken remnant of the keeping up of a perpetual
fire, the continuity being to some extent preserved by the use of a
brand from last year's blaze.

Another tradition and its origin are thus described by Sir Laurence
Gomme:﻿—

> “From there being an ever-burning fire, it has come to be that the
> fire must not be allowed to be extinguished on the last day of the old
> year, so that the old year's fire may last into the new year. In
> Lanarkshire it is considered unlucky to give out a light to any one on
> the morning of the new year, and therefore if the house-fire has been
> allowed to become extinguished recourse must be had to the embers of
> <span id="page_258">p. 258</span> <span id="Page_258"></span>the
> village pile \[for on New Year's Eve a great public bonfire is made\].
> In some places the self-extinction of the yule-log at Christmas is
> portentous of evil.”﻿ [11-21](crt22.htm#Note_11-21)<span
> id="Nanchor_11-21"></span>

In the north of England in the days of tinder-boxes, if any one could
not get a light it was useless to ask a neighbour for one, so
frightfully unlucky was it to allow any light to leave the house between
Christmas Eve and New Year's Day.﻿ [11-22](crt22.htm#Note_11-22)<span
id="Nanchor_11-22"></span> The idea of the unluckiness of giving out
fire at the Kalends of January can be traced back to the eighth century
when, as we saw in  [VI](crt10.htm#Chapter_VI), St. Boniface alluded to
this superstition among the people or Rome.

In Shropshire the idea is extended even to ashes, which must not be
thrown out of the house on Christmas Day, “for fear of throwing them in
Our Saviour's face.” Perhaps such superstitions may originally have had
to do with dread that the “luck” of the family, the household spirit,
might be carried away with the gift of fire from the
hearth.﻿ [11-23](crt22.htm#Note_11-23)<span id="Nanchor_11-23"></span>

When Miss Burne wrote in the eighties there were still many West
Shropshire people who could remember seeing the “Christmas Brand” drawn
by horses to the farmhouse door, and placed at the back of the wide open
hearth, where the flame was made up in front of it. “The embers,” says
one informant, “were raked up to it every night, and it was carefully
tended that it might not go out during the whole season, during which
time no light might either be struck, given, or borrowed.” At Cleobury
Mortimer in the south-east of the county the silence of the curfew bell
during “the Christmas” points to a time when fires might not be
extinguished during that season.﻿ [11-24](crt22.htm#Note_11-24)<span
id="Nanchor_11-24"></span>

The place of the Yule log in Devonshire is taken by the “ashen
\[sometimes “ashton”\] faggot,” still burnt in many a farm on Christmas
Eve. The sticks of ash are fastened together by ashen bands, and the
traditional custom is for a quart of cider to be called for and served
to the merrymaking company, as each band bursts in the
flames.﻿ [11-25](crt22.htm#Note_11-25)<span id="Nanchor_11-25"></span>

In England the Yule log was often supplemented or replaced <span
id="page_259">p. 259</span> <span id="Page_259"></span>by a great
candle. At Ripon in the eighteenth century the chandlers sent their
customers large candles on Christmas Eve, and the coopers, logs of
wood.﻿ [11-26](crt22.htm#Note_11-26)<span id="Nanchor_11-26"></span>
Hampson, writing in 1841, says:﻿—

> “In some places candles are made of a particular kind, because the
> candle that is lighted on Christmas Day must be so large as to burn
> from the time of its ignition to the close of the day, otherwise it
> will portend evil to the family for the ensuing year. The poor were
> wont to present the rich with wax tapers, and yule candles are still
> in the north of Scotland given by merchants to their customers. At one
> time children at the village schools in Lancashire were required to
> bring each a mould candle before the *parting* or separation for the
> Christmas holidays.”﻿ [101](crt24.htm#Footnote_101)<span
> id="FNanchor_101"></span>﻿ [11-27](crt22.htm#Note_11-27)<span
> id="Nanchor_11-27"></span>

In the Scandinavian countries the Yule candle is, or was, very prominent
indeed. In West Jutland (Denmark) two great tallow candles stood on the
festive board. No one dared to touch or extinguish them, and if by any
mischance one went out it was a portent of death. They stood for the
husband and wife, and that one of the wedded pair whose candle burnt the
longer would outlive the other.﻿ [11-28](crt22.htm#Note_11-28)<span
id="Nanchor_11-28"></span>

In Norway also two lights were placed on the
table.﻿ [11-29](crt22.htm#Note_11-29)<span id="Nanchor_11-29"></span>
All over the Scandinavian lands the Yule candle had to burn throughout
the night; it was not to be extinguished till the sun rose or﻿—as was
said elsewhere﻿—till the beginning of service on Christmas Day.
Sometimes the putting-out had to be done by the oldest member of the
family or the father of the household. In Norway the candle was lighted
every evening until New Year's Day. While it foreshadowed death if it
went out, so long as it duly burned it shed a blessing with its light,
and, in order to secure abundance of good things, money, clothes, food,
and drink were spread out that its rays might fall upon them. The
remains of the candle were used in various ways to benefit man and
beast. Sometimes a cross was branded with them upon the animals on
Christmas morning; in Sweden the plough was smeared with <span
id="page_260">p. 260</span> <span id="Page_260"></span>the tallow, when
used for the first time in spring. Or again the tallow was given to the
fowls; and, lastly, in Denmark the ends were preserved and burnt in
thundery weather to protect the house from
lightning.﻿ [11-30](crt22.htm#Note_11-30)<span
id="Nanchor_11-30"></span> There is an analogy here with the use of the
Christmas log, and also of the candles of the Purification (see
 [XVI](crt20.htm#Chapter_XVI)).
