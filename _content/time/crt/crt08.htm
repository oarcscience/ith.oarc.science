<P>In this chapter the Christian side only of the Christmas drama will be 
treated. Much folk-drama of pagan origin has gathered round the festival, but 
this we shall study in our Second Part. Our subject here is the dramatic 
representation of the story of the Nativity and the events immediately connected 
with it. The Christmas drama has passed through the same stages as the poetry of 
the Nativity. There is first a monastic and hieratic stage, when the drama is 
but an expansion of the liturgy, a piece of ceremonial performed by clerics with 
little attempt at verisimilitude and with Latin words drawn mainly from the 
Bible or the offices of the Church. Then, as the laity come to take a more 
personal interest in Christianity, we find fancy beginning to play around the 
subject, bringing out its human pathos and charm, until, after a transitional 
stage, the drama leaves the sanctuary, passes from Latin to the vulgar tongue, 
is played by lay performers in the streets and squares of the city, and, while 
its framework remains religious, takes into itself episodes of a more or less 
secular character. The Latin liturgical plays are to the &#8220;miracles&#8221; and 
&#8220;mysteries&#8221; of the later Middle Ages as a Romanesque church, solemn, oppressive, 
hieratic, to <A NAME="page_122"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 122</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_122"></A>a Gothic cathedral, soaring, audacious, reflecting every 
phase of the popular life.</P>
<P>The mediaeval religious drama&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-1">5-1</A><a name="Nanchor_5-1"></A> was a natural development from the Catholic liturgy, 
not an imitation of classical models. The classical drama had expired at the 
break-up of the Roman Empire; its death was due largely, indeed, to the 
hostility of Christianity, but also to the rude indifference of the barbarian 
invaders. Whatever secular dramatic impulses remained in the Dark Ages showed 
themselves not in public and organized performances, but obscurely in the songs 
and mimicry of minstrels and in traditional folk-customs. Both of these classes 
of practices were strongly opposed by the Church, because of their connection 
with heathenism and the licence towards which they tended. Yet the dramatic 
instinct could not be suppressed. The folk-drama in such forms as the Feast of 
Fools found its way, as we shall see, even into the sanctuary, and&#65279;&#8212;most 
remarkable fact of all&#65279;&#8212;the Church's own services took on more and more a 
dramatic character.</P>
<P>While the secular stage decayed, the Church was building up a stately system 
of ritual. It is needless to dwell upon the dramatic elements in Catholic 
worship. The central act of Christian devotion, the Eucharist, is in its essence 
a drama, a representation of the death of the Redeemer and the participation of 
the faithful in its benefits, and around this has gathered in the Mass a 
multitude of dramatic actions expressing different aspects of the Redemption. 
Nor, of course, is there merely symbolic <I>action</I>; the offices of the 
Church are in great part <I>dialogues</I> between priest and people, or between 
two sets of singers. It was from this antiphonal song, this alternation of 
versicle and respond, that the religious drama of the Middle Ages took its rise. 
In the ninth century the &#8220;Antiphonarium&#8221; traditionally ascribed to Pope Gregory 
the Great had become insufficient for ambitious choirs, and the practice grew up 
of supplementing it by new melodies and words inserted at the beginning or end 
or even in the middle of the old antiphons. The new texts were called &#8220;tropes,&#8221; 
and from the ninth to the thirteenth century many were written. An interesting 
Christmas <A NAME="page_123"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 123</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_123"></A>example is the following ninth-century trope ascribed to 
Tutilo of St. Gall:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&#8220;Hodie cantandus est nobis puer, quem gignebat ineffabiliter ante tempora 
  pater, et eundem sub tempore generavit inclyta mater. (To-day must we sing of 
  a Child, whom in unspeakable wise His Father begat before all times, and whom, 
  within time, a glorious mother brought forth.)</P>
  <P>Int[errogatio].</P>
  <P>Quis est iste puer quem tam magnis praeconiis dignum vociferatis? Dicite 
  nobis ut collaudatores esse possimus. (Who is this Child whom ye proclaim 
  worthy of so great laudations? Tell us that we also may praise Him.)</P>
  <P>Resp[onsio].</P>
  <P>Hic enim est quem praesagus et electus symmista Dei ad terram venturum 
  praevidens longe ante praenotavit, sicque praedixit. (This is He whose coming 
  to earth the prophetic and chosen initiate into the mysteries of God foresaw 
  and pointed out long before, and thus foretold.)&#8221;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Here followed at once the Introit for the third Mass of Christmas Day, &#8220;Puer 
natus est nobis, et filius datus est nobis, &amp;c. (Unto us a child is born, 
unto us a son is given.)&#8221; The question and answer were no doubt sung by 
different choirs.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-2">5-2</A><a name="Nanchor_5-2"></A> </P>
<P>One can well imagine that this might develop into a regular little drama. As 
a matter of fact, however, it was from an Easter trope in the same manuscript, 
the &#8220;Quem quaeritis,&#8221; a dialogue between the three Maries and the angel at the 
sepulchre, that the liturgical drama sprang. The trope became very popular, and 
was gradually elaborated into a short symbolic drama, and its popularity led to 
the composition of similar pieces for Christmas and Ascensiontide. Here is the 
Christmas trope from a St. Gall manuscript:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&#8220;<I>On the Nativity of the Lord at Mass let there be ready two deacons 
  having on dalmatics, behind the altar, saying</I>:</P>
  <P>Quem quaeritis in praesepe, pastores, dicite? (Whom seek ye in the manger, 
  say, ye shepherds?)<A NAME="page_124"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 124</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_124"></A></P>
  <P><I>Let two cantors in the choir answer</I>:</P>
  <P>Salvatorem Christum Dominum, infantem pannis involutum, secundum sermonem 
  angelicum. (The Saviour, Christ the Lord, a child wrapped in swaddling 
  clothes, according to the angelic word.)</P>
  <P><I>And the deacons</I>:</P>
  <P>Adest hic parvulus cum Maria, matre sua, de qua, vaticinando, Isaias 
  Propheta: ecce virgo concipiet et pariet filium; et nuntiantes dicite quia 
  natus est. (Present here is the little one with Mary, His Mother, of whom 
  Isaiah the prophet foretold: Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and shall bring 
  forth a son; and do ye say and announce that He is born.)</P>
  <P><I>Then let the cantor lift up his voice and say</I>:</P>
  <P>Alleluia, alleluia, jam vere scimus Christum natum in terris, de quo 
  canite, omnes, cum Propheta dicentes: Puer natus est! (Alleluia, alleluia. Now 
  we know indeed that Christ is born on earth, of whom sing ye all, saying with 
  the Prophet: Unto us a child is born.)&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-3">5-3</A><a name="Nanchor_5-3"></A> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The dramatic character of this is very marked. A comparison with later 
liturgical plays suggests that the two deacons in their broad vestments were 
meant to represent the midwives mentioned in the apocryphal Gospel of St. James, 
and the cantors the shepherds.</P>
<P>A development from this trope, apparently, was the &#8220;Office of the Shepherds,&#8221; 
which probably took shape in the eleventh century, though it is first given in a 
Rouen manuscript of the thirteenth. It must have been an impressive ceremony as 
performed in the great cathedral, dimly lit with candles, and full of mysterious 
black recesses and hints of infinity. Behind the high altar a <I>praesepe</I> or 
&#8220;crib&#8221; was prepared, with an image of the Virgin. After the &#8220;Te Deum&#8221; had been 
sung five canons or their vicars, clad in albs and amices, entered by the great 
door of the choir, and proceeded towards the apse. These were the shepherds. 
Suddenly from high above them came a clear boy's voice: &#8220;Fear not, behold I 
bring you good tidings of great joy,&#8221; and the rest of the angelic message. The 
&#8220;multitude of the heavenly host&#8221; was represented by other boys stationed 
probably <A NAME="page_125"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 125</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_125"></A>in the triforium galleries, who broke out into the exultant 
&#8220;Gloria in excelsis.&#8221; Singing a hymn, &#8220;Pax in terris nunciatur,&#8221; the shepherds 
advanced towards the crib where two priests&#65279;&#8212;the midwives&#65279;&#8212;awaited them. These 
addressed to the shepherds the question &#8220;Whom seek ye in the manger?&#8221; and then 
came the rest of the &#8220;Quem quaeritis&#8221; which we already know, a hymn to the 
Virgin being sung while the shepherds adored the Infant. Mass followed 
immediately, the little drama being merely a prelude.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-4">5-4</A><a name="Nanchor_5-4"></A> </P>
<P>More important than this Office of the Shepherds is an Epiphany play called 
by various names, &#8220;Stella,&#8221; &#8220;Tres Reges,&#8221; &#8220;Magi,&#8221; or &#8220;Herodes,&#8221; and found in 
different forms at Limoges, Rouen, Laon, Compi&egrave;gne, Strasburg, Le Mans, Freising 
in Bavaria, and other places. Mr. E. K. Chambers suggests that its kernel is a 
dramatized Offertory. It was a custom for Christian kings to present gold, 
frankincense, and myrrh at the Epiphany&#65279;&#8212;the offering is still made by proxy at 
the Chapel Royal, St. James's&#65279;&#8212;and Mr. Chambers takes &#8220;the play to have served 
as a substitute for this ceremony, when no king actually regnant was 
present.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-5">5-5</A><a name="Nanchor_5-5"></A> Its most essential features were the appearance of the 
Star of Bethlehem to the Magi, and their offering of the mystic gifts. The star, 
bright with candles, hung from the roof of the church, and was sometimes made to 
move.</P>
<P>In the Rouen version of the play it is ordered that on the day of the 
Epiphany, Terce having been sung, three clerics, robed as kings, shall come from 
the east, north, and south, and meet before the altar, with their servants 
bearing the offerings of the Magi. The king from the east, pointing to the star 
with his stick, exclaims:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&#8220;Stella fulgore nimio rutilat. (The star glows with exceeding 
  brightness.)&#8221;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The second monarch answers:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&#8220;Quae regem regum natum demonstrat. (Which shows the birth of the King of 
  Kings.)&#8221;<A NAME="page_126"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 126</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_126"></A></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And the third:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&#8220;Quem venturum olim prophetiae signaverant. (To whose coming the prophecies 
  of old had pointed.)&#8221;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Then the Magi kiss one another and together sing:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&#8220;Eamus ergo et inquiramus eum, offerentes ei munera: aurum, thus, et 
  myrrham. (Let us therefore go and seek Him, offering unto Him gifts: gold, 
  frankincense, and myrrh.)&#8221;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Antiphons are sung, a procession is formed, and the Magi go to a certain 
altar above which an image of the Virgin has been placed with a lighted star 
before it. Two priests in dalmatics&#65279;&#8212;apparently the midwives&#65279;&#8212;standing on either 
side of the altar, inquire who the Magi are, and receiving their answer, draw 
aside a curtain and bid them approach to worship the Child, &#8220;for He is the 
redemption of the world.&#8221; The three kings do adoration, and offer their gifts, 
each with a few pregnant words:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i2>&#8220;Suscipe, rex, aurum. (Receive, O King, 
gold.)&#8221;</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>&#8220;Tolle thus, tu vere Deus. (Accept incense, 
Thou very God.)&#8221;</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>&#8220;Myrrham, signum sepulturae. (Myrrh, 
the sign of burial.)&#8221;</SPAN><BR></DIV></DIV>
<P>The clergy and people then make their offerings, while the Magi fall asleep 
and are warned by an angel to return home another way. This they do symbolically 
by proceeding back to the choir by a side aisle.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-6">5-6</A><a name="Nanchor_5-6"></A> </P>
<P>In its later forms the Epiphany play includes the appearance of Herod, who is 
destined to fill a very important place in the mediaeval drama. Hamlet's saying 
&#8220;he out-Herods Herod&#8221; sufficiently suggests the raging tyrant whom the 
playwrights of the Middle Ages loved. His appearance marks perhaps the first 
introduction into the Christian religious play of the evil principle so 
necessary to dramatic effect. At first Herod holds merely a mild conversation 
with the Magi, begging them to tell him when they have found the new-born King; 
in later versions of the play, however, his wrath is shown on learning that the 
Wise Men have <A NAME="page_127"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 127</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_127"></A>departed home by another way; he breaks out into 
bloodthirsty tirades, orders the slaying of the Innocents, and in one form takes 
a sword and brandishes it in the air. He becomes in fact the outstanding figure 
in the drama, and one can understand why it was sometimes named after him.</P>
<P>In the Laon &#8220;Stella&#8221; the actual murder of the Innocents was represented, the 
symbolical figure of Rachel weeping over her children being introduced. The 
plaint and consolation of Rachel, it should be noted, seem at first to have 
formed an independent little piece performed probably on Holy Innocents&#146; Day.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-7">5-7</A><a name="Nanchor_5-7"></A> This later coalesced with the &#8220;Stella,&#8221; as did also the 
play of the shepherds, and, at a still later date, another liturgical drama 
which we must now consider&#65279;&#8212;the &#8220;Prophetae.&#8221;</P>
<P>This had its origin in a sermon (wrongly ascribed to St. Augustine) against 
Jews, Pagans, and Arians, a portion of which was used in many churches as a 
Christmas lesson. It begins with a rhetorical appeal to the Jews who refuse to 
accept Jesus as the Messiah in spite of the witness of their own prophets. Ten 
prophets are made to give their testimony, and then three Pagans are called 
upon, Virgil, Nebuchadnezzar and the Erythraean Sibyl. The sermon has a strongly 
dramatic character, and when chanted in church the parts of the preacher and the 
prophets were possibly distributed among different choristers. In time it 
developed into a regular drama, and more prophets were brought in. It was, 
indeed, the germ of the great Old Testament cycles of the later Middle Ages.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-8">5-8</A><a name="Nanchor_5-8"></A> </P>
<P>An extension of the &#8220;Prophetae&#8221; was the Norman or Anglo-Norman play of 
&#8220;Adam,&#8221; which began with the Fall, continued with Cain and Abel, and ended with 
the witness of the prophets. In the other direction the &#8220;Prophetae&#8221; was extended 
by the addition of the &#8220;Stella.&#8221; It so happens that there is no text of a Latin 
drama containing both these extensions at the same time, but such a play 
probably existed. From the mid-thirteenth to the mid-fourteenth century, indeed, 
there was a tendency for the plays to run together into cycles and become too 
long and too elaborate for performance in church. In the eleventh century, even, 
they had begun to pass out into the churchyard or <A NAME="page_128"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 128</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_128"></A>the market-place, and to be played not only by the clergy 
but by laymen. This change had extremely important effects on their character. 
In the first place the vulgar tongue crept in. As early, possibly, as the 
twelfth century are the Norman &#8220;Adam&#8221; and the Spanish &#8220;Misterio de los Reyes 
Magos,&#8221; the former, as we have seen, an extended vernacular &#8220;Prophetae,&#8221; the 
latter, a fragment of a highly developed vernacular &#8220;Stella.&#8221; They are the first 
of the popular as distinguished from the liturgical plays; they were meant, as 
their language shows, for the instruction and delight of the folk; they were not 
to be listened to, like the mysterious Latin of the liturgy, in uncomprehending 
reverence, but were to be understanded of the people.</P>
<P>The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries saw a progressive supplanting of 
Latin by the common speech, until, in the great cycles, only a few scraps of the 
church language were left to tell of the liturgical origin of the drama. The 
process of popularization, the development of the plays from religious 
ceremonial to lively drama, was probably greatly helped by the <I>goliards</I> 
or vagabond scholars, young, poor, and fond of amusement, who wandered over 
Europe from teacher to teacher, from monastery to monastery, in search of 
learning. Their influence is shown not merely in the broadening of the drama, 
but also in its passing from the Latin of the monasteries to the language of the 
common folk.</P>
<P>A consequence of the outdoor performance of the plays was that Christmas, in 
the northern countries at all events, was found an unsuitable time for them. The 
summer was naturally preferred, and we find comparatively few mentions of plays 
at Christmas in the later Middle Ages. Whitsuntide and Corpus Christi became 
more popular dates, especially in England, and the pieces then performed were 
vast cosmic cycles, like the York, Chester, Towneley, and &#8220;Coventry&#8221; plays, in 
which the Christmas and Epiphany episodes formed but links in an immense chain 
extending from the Creation to the Last Judgment, and representing the whole 
scheme of salvation. It is in these Nativity scenes, however, that we have the 
only English renderings of the Christmas story in drama,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-9">5-9</A><a name="Nanchor_5-9"></A> and though they <A NAME="page_129"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 129</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_129"></A>were actually performed not at the winter festival&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_42">42</A><a name="FNanchor_42"></A> but in the summer, they give in so striking a way the 
feelings, the point of view, of our mediaeval forefathers in regard to the 
Nativity that we are justified in dealing with them here at some length.</P>
<P>As the drama became laicized, it came to reflect that strange medley of 
conflicting elements, pagan and Christian, materialistic and spiritual, which 
was the actual religion of the folk, as distinguished from the philosophical 
theology of the doctors and councils and the mysticism of the ascetics. The 
popularizing of Christianity had reached its climax in most countries of western 
Europe in the fifteenth century, approximately the period of the great 
&#8220;mysteries.&#8221; However little the ethical teaching of Jesus may have been acted 
upon, the Christian religion on its external side had been thoroughly 
appropriated by the people and wrought into a many-coloured polytheism, a true 
reflection of their minds.</P>
<P>The figures of the drama are contemporaries of the spectators both in garb 
and character; they are not Orientals of ancient times, but Europeans of the end 
of the Middle Ages. Bethlehem is a &#8220;faier borow,&#8221; Herod a &#8220;mody king,&#8221; like unto 
some haughty, capricious, and violent monarch of the time, the shepherds are 
rustics of England or Germany or France or Italy, the Magi mighty potentates 
with gorgeous trains, and the Child Himself is a little being subject to all the 
pains and necessities of infancy, but delighted with sweet and pleasant things 
like a bob of cherries or a ball. The realism of the writers is sometimes 
astounding, and comic elements often appear&#65279;&#8212;to the people of the Middle Ages 
religion was so real and natural a thing that they could laugh at it without 
ceasing to believe in or to love it.</P>
<P>The English mediaeval playwrights, it may safely be said, are surpassed by no 
foreigners in their treatment of Christmas subjects. To illustrate their way of 
handling the scenes I may <A NAME="page_130"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 130</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_130"></A>gather from the four great cycles a few of the most 
interesting passages.</P>
<P>From the so-called &#8220;Ludus Coventriae&#8221; I take the arrival of Joseph and Mary 
at Bethlehem; they ask a man in the street where they may find an inn:&#65279;&#8212;</P>

<P>The playwrights are at their best in the shepherd scenes; indeed these are 
the most original parts of the cycles, for here the writers found little to help 
them in theological tradition, and were thrown upon their own wit. In humorous 
dialogue and na&iuml;ve sentiment the lusty burgesses of the fifteenth century were 
thoroughly at home, and the comedy and pathos of these scenes must have been as 
welcome a relief to the spectators, from the <A NAME="page_133"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 133</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_133"></A>long-winded solemnity of many of the plays, as they are to 
modern readers. In the York mysteries the shepherds make uncouth exclamations at 
the song of the angels and ludicrously try to imitate it. The Chester shepherds 
talk in a very natural way of such things as the diseases of sheep, sit down 
with much relish to a meal of &#8220;ale of Halton,&#8221; sour milk, onions, garlick and 
leeks, green cheese, a sheep's head soused in ale, and other items; then they 
call their lad Trowle, who grumbles because his wages have not been paid, 
refuses to eat, wrestles with his masters and throws them all. They sit down 
discomfited; then the Star of Bethlehem appears, filling them with wonder, which 
grows when they hear the angels&#146; song of &#8220;Gloria in excelsis.&#8221; They discuss what 
the words were&#65279;&#8212;&#8220;glore, glare with a glee,&#8221; or, &#8220;glori, glory, glorious,&#8221; or, 
&#8220;glory, glory, with a glo.&#8221; At length they go to Bethlehem, and arrived at the 
stable, the first shepherd exclaims:&#65279;&#8212;</P>

<P>Their gifts to the Infant are a bell, a flask, a spoon to eat pottage with, 
and a cape. Trowle the servant has nought to offer but a pair of his wife's old 
hose; four boys follow with presents of a bottle, a hood, a pipe, and a 
nut-hook. Quaint are the words of the last two givers:&#65279;&#8212;</P>

<P>Let no one deem this irreverent; the spirit of this adoration of the 
shepherds is intensely devout; they go away longing to tell all the world the 
wonder they have seen; one will become a pilgrim; even the rough Trowle exclaims 
that he will forsake the shepherd's craft and will betake himself to an 
anchorite's hard by, in prayers to &#8220;wache and wake.&#8221;</P>
<P>More famous than this Chester &#8220;Pastores&#8221; are the two shepherd plays in the 
Towneley cycle.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-16">5-16</A><a name="Nanchor_5-16"></A> The first begins with racy talk, leading to a wrangle 
between two of the shepherds about some imaginary sheep; then a third arrives 
and makes fun of them both; a feast follows, with much homely detail; they go to 
sleep and are awakened by the angelic message; after much debate over its 
meaning and over the foretellings of the prophets&#65279;&#8212;one of them, strangely 
enough, quotes a Latin passage from Virgil&#65279;&#8212;they go to Bethlehem and present to 
the Child a &#8220;lytyll spruse cofer,&#8221; a ball, and a gourd-bottle.</P>
<P>The second play surpasses in humour anything else in the mediaeval drama of 
any country. We find the shepherds first complaining of the cold and their hard 
lot; they are &#8220;al lappyd in sorow.&#8221; They talk, almost like modern Socialists, of 
the oppressions of the rich:&#65279;&#8212;</P>

<P>To these shepherds joins himself Mak, a thieving neighbour. Going to sleep, 
they make him lie between them, for they doubt his honesty. But for all their 
precautions he manages to steal a sheep, and carries it home to his wife. She 
thinks of an ingenious plan for concealing it from the shepherds if they visit 
the cottage seeking their lost property: she will pretend that she is in 
child-bed and that the sheep is the new-born infant. So it is wrapped up and 
laid in a cradle, and Mak sings a lullaby. The shepherds do suspect Mak, and 
come to search his house; his wife upbraids them and keeps them from the cradle. 
They depart, but suddenly an idea comes to one of them:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>

<P>Mak tries to put him off, but the shepherd will have his way:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i15>&#8220;Gyf me lefe hym to kys, and lyft up the 
clowtt.</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>What the devill is this? he has a long

<P>So the secret is out. Mak's wife gives a desperate explanation:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i15>&#8220;He was takyn with an elfe,</SPAN><BR><SPAN  class=i2>I saw it myself.</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>When the clok stroke

<P><A NAME="page_136"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 136</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_136"></A>Naturally this avails nothing, and her husband is given a 
good tossing by the shepherds until they are tired out and lie down to rest. 
Then comes the &#8220;Gloria in excelsis&#8221; and the call of the angel:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>

<P>The charm of this will be felt by every reader; it lies in a curious 
incongruity&#65279;&#8212;extreme homeliness joined to awe; the Infinite is contained within 
the narrowest human bounds; God Himself, the Creator and Sustainer of the 
universe, a weak, helpless child. But a step more, and all would have been 
irreverence; as it is we have devotion, human, na&iuml;ve, and touching.</P>
<P>It would be interesting to show how other scenes connected with Christmas are 
handled in the English miracle-plays: how Octavian (Caesar Augustus) sent out 
the decree that all the world should be taxed, and learned from the Sibyl the 
birth of Christ; how the Magi were led by the star and offered their symbolic 
gifts; how the raging of the boastful tyrant Herod, the <A NAME="page_138"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 138</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_138"></A>Slaughter of the Innocents, and the Flight into Egypt are 
treated; but these scenes, though full of colour, are on the whole less 
remarkable than the shepherd and Nativity pieces, and space forbids us to dwell 
upon them. They contain many curious anachronisms, as when Herod invokes 
Mahounde, and talks about his princes, prelates, barons, baronets and 
burgesses.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_73">73</A><a name="FNanchor_73"></A></P>
<P>The religious play in England did not long survive the Reformation. Under the 
influence of Protestantism, with its vigilant dread of profanity and 
superstition, the cycles were shorn of many of their scenes, the performances 
became irregular, and by the end of the sixteenth century they had mostly ceased 
to be. Not sacred story, but the play of human character, was henceforth the 
material of the drama. The rich, variegated religion of the people, communal in 
its expression, tinged everywhere with human colour, gave place to a sterner, 
colder, more individual faith, fearful of contamination by the use of the 
outward and visible.</P>
<P class=thoughtbreak>There is little or no trace in the vernacular Christmas 
plays of direct translation from one language into another, though there was 
some borrowing of motives. Thus the Christmas drama of each nation has its own 
special flavour.</P>
<P>If we turn to France, we find a remarkable fifteenth-century cycle that 
belongs purely to the winter festival, and shows the strictly Christmas drama at 
its fullest development. This great mystery of the &#8220;Incarnacion et nativit&eacute; de 
nostre saulveur et redempteur Jesuchrist&#8221; was performed out-of-doors at Rouen in 
1474, an exceptional event for a northern city in winter-time. The twenty-four 
<I>establies</I> or &#8220;mansions&#8221; set up for the various scenes reached across the 
market-place from the &#8220;Axe and Crown&#8221; Inn to the &#8220;Angel.&#8221;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_139"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 139</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_139"></A>After a prologue briefly explaining its purpose, the 
mystery begins, like the old liturgical plays, with the witness of the prophets; 
then follows a scene in Limbo where Adam is shown lamenting his fate, and 
another in Heaven where the Redemption of mankind is discussed and the 
Incarnation decided upon. With the Annunciation and the Visitation of the Virgin 
the first day closed. The second day opened with the ordering by Octavian of the

<P>At last Christ is born, welcomed by the song of the angels, adored by His 
mother. In the heathen temples the idols fall; Hell mouth opens and shows the 
rage of the demons, who make a hideous noise; fire issues from the nostrils and 
eyes and ears of Hell, which shuts up with the devils within it. And then the 
angels in the stable worship the Child Jesus. The adoration of the shepherds was 
shown with many na&iuml;ve details for the delight of the people, and the performance 
ended with the offering of a sacrifice in Rome by the Emperor Octavian to an 
image of the Blessed Virgin.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-19">5-19</A><a name="Nanchor_5-19"></A> </P>
<P>The French playwrights, quite as much as the English, love comic shepherd 
scenes with plenty of eating and drinking and brawling. A traditional figure is 
the shepherd Rifflart, always a laughable type. In the strictly mediaeval plays 
the shepherds are true French rustics, but with the progress of the Renaissance 
classical elements creep into the pastoral scenes; in a mystery printed in 1507 
Orpheus with the Nymphs and Oreads is introduced. As might be expected, 
anachronisms often occur; a peculiarly piquant instance is found in the S. 
Genevi&egrave;ve mystery, where Caesar Augustus gets a piece of Latin translated into 
French for his convenience.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_141"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 141</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_141"></A>Late examples of French Christmas mysteries are the 
so-called &#8220;comedies&#8221; of the Nativity, Adoration of the Kings, Massacre of the 
Innocents, and Flight into Egypt contained in the &#8220;Marguerites&#8221; (published in 
1547) of Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, sister of Fran&ccedil;ois I. Intermingled with 
the traditional figures treated more or less in the traditional way are 
personified abstractions like Philosophy, Tribulation, Inspiration, Divine 
Intelligence, and Contemplation, which largely rob the plays of dramatic effect. 
There is some true poetry in these pieces, but too much theological learning and 
too little simplicity, and in one place the ideas of Calvin seem to show 
themselves.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-20">5-20</A><a name="Nanchor_5-20"></A> </P>
<P>The French mystery began to fall into decay about the middle of the sixteenth 
century. It was attacked on every side: by the new poets of the Renaissance, who 
preferred classical to Christian subjects; by the Protestants, who deemed the 
religious drama a trifling with the solemn truths of Scripture; and even by the 
Catholic clergy, who, roused to greater strictness by the challenge of 
Protestantism, found the comic elements in the plays offensive and dangerous, 
and perhaps feared that too great familiarity with the Bible as represented in 
the mysteries might lead the people into heresy.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-21">5-21</A><a name="Nanchor_5-21"></A> Yet we hear occasionally of Christmas dramas in 
France in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries. In the 
neighbourhood of Nantes, for instance, a play of the Nativity by Claude Mac&eacute;e, 
hermit, probably written in the seventeenth century, was commonly performed in 
the first half of the nineteenth.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-22">5-22</A><a name="Nanchor_5-22"></A> At Clermont the adoration of the shepherds was still 
performed in 1718, and some kind of representation of the scene continued in the 
diocese of Cambrai until 1834, when it was forbidden by the bishop. In the 
south, especially at Marseilles, &#8220;pastorals&#8221; were played towards the end of the 
nineteenth century; they had, however, largely lost their sacred character, and 
had become a kind of review of the events of the year.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-23">5-23</A><a name="Nanchor_5-23"></A> At Dinan, in Brittany, some sort of Herod play was 
performed, though it was dying out, in 1886. It was acted by young men on the 
Epiphany, and there was an &#8220;innocent&#8221; whose throat they pretended to cut with a 
wooden sword.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-24">5-24</A><a name="Nanchor_5-24"></A> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_142"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 142</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_142"></A>An interesting summary of a very full Nativity play 
performed in the churches of Upper Gascony on Christmas Eve is given by Countess 
Martinengo-Cesaresco.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-25">5-25</A><a name="Nanchor_5-25"></A> It ranges from the arrival of Joseph and Mary at 
Bethlehem to the Flight into Egypt and the Murder of the Innocents, but perhaps 
the most interesting parts are the shepherd scenes. After the message of the 
angel&#65279;&#8212;a child in a surplice, with wings fastened to his shoulders, seated on a 
chair drawn up to the ceiling and supported by ropes&#65279;&#8212;the shepherds leave the 
church, the whole of which is now regarded as the stable of the Divine Birth. 
They knock for admittance, and Joseph, regretting that the chamber is &#8220;so badly 
lighted,&#8221; lets them in. They fall down before the manger, and so do the 
shepherdesses, who &#8220;deposit on the altar steps a banner covered with flowers and 
greenery, from which hang strings of small birds, apples, nuts, chestnuts, and 
other fruits. It is their Christmas offering to the cur&eacute;; the shepherds have 
already placed a whole sheep before the altar, in a like spirit.&#8221; The play is 
not mere dumb-show, but has a full libretto.</P>
<P>A rather similar piece of dramatic ceremonial is described by Barth&eacute;lemy in 
his edition of Durandus,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-26">5-26</A><a name="Nanchor_5-26"></A> as customary in the eighteenth century at La 
Villeneuve-en-Chevrie, near Mantes. At the Midnight Mass a <I>cr&egrave;che</I> with a 
wax figure of the Holy Child was placed in the choir, with tapers burning about 
it. After the &#8220;Te Deum&#8221; had been sung, the celebrant, accompanied by his 
attendants, censed the <I>cr&egrave;che</I>, to the sound of violins, double-basses, 
and other instruments. A shepherd then prostrated himself before the crib, 
holding a sheep with a sort of little saddle bearing sixteen lighted candles. He 
was followed by two shepherdesses in white with distaffs and tapers. A second 
shepherd, between two shepherdesses, carried a laurel branch, to which were 
fastened oranges, lemons, biscuits, and sweetmeats. Two others brought great 
<I>pains-b&eacute;nits</I> and lighted candles; then came four shepherdesses, who made 
their adoration, and lastly twenty-six more shepherds, two by two, bearing in 
one hand a candle and in the other a festooned crook. The same ceremonial was 
practised at the Offertory and after the close of the Mass. All was done, it is 
said, with such piety and edification that <A NAME="page_143"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 143</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_143"></A>St. Luke's words about the Bethlehem shepherds were true of 
these French swains&#65279;&#8212;they &#8220;returned glorifying and praising God for all the 
things they had heard and seen.&#8221;</P>
<P class=thoughtbreak>In German there remain very few Christmas plays earlier 
than the fifteenth century. Later periods, however, have produced a multitude, 
and dramatic performances at Christmas have continued down to quite modern times 
in German-speaking parts.</P>
<P>At Oberufer near Pressburg&#65279;&#8212;a German Protestant village in Hungary&#65279;&#8212;some 
fifty years ago, a Christmas play was performed under the direction of an old 
farmer, whose office as instructor had descended from father to son. The play 
took place at intervals of from three to ten years and was acted on all Sundays 
and festivals from Advent to the Epiphany. Great care was taken to ensure the 
strictest piety and morality in the actors, and no secular music was allowed in 
the place during the season for the performances. The practices began as early 
as October. On the first Sunday in Advent there was a solemn procession to the 
hall hired for the play. First went a man bearing a gigantic star&#65279;&#8212;he was called 
the &#8220;Master Singer&#8221;&#65279;&#8212;and another carrying a Christmas-tree decked with ribbons 
and apples; then came all the actors, singing hymns. There was no scenery and no 
theatrical apparatus beyond a straw-seated chair and a wooden stool. When the 
first was used, the scene was understood to be Jerusalem, when the second, 
Bethlehem. The Christmas drama, immediately preceded by an Adam and Eve play, 
and succeeded by a Shrove Tuesday one, followed mediaeval lines, and included 
the wanderings of Joseph and Mary round the inns of Bethlehem, the angelic 
tidings to the shepherds, their visit to the manger, the adoration of the Three 
Kings, and various Herod scenes. Protestant influence was shown by the 
introduction of Luther's &#8220;Vom Himmel hoch,&#8221; but the general character was very 
much that of the old mysteries, and the dialogue was full of quaint na&iuml;vet&eacute;.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-27">5-27</A><a name="Nanchor_5-27"></A> </P>
<P>At Brixlegg, in Tyrol, as late as 1872 a long Christmas play was acted under 
Catholic auspices; some of its dialogue was in <A NAME="page_144"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 144</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_144"></A>the Tyrolese <I>patois</I> and racy and humorous, other 
parts, and particularly the speeches of Mary and Joseph&#65279;&#8212;out of respect for 
these holy personages&#65279;&#8212;had been rewritten in the eighteenth century in a very 
stilted and undramatic style. Some simple shepherd plays are said to be still 
presented in the churches of the Saxon Erzgebirge.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-28">5-28</A><a name="Nanchor_5-28"></A> </P>
<P>The German language is perhaps richer in real Christmas plays, as 
distinguished from Nativity and Epiphany episodes in great cosmic cycles, than 
any other. There are some examples in mediaeval manuscripts, but the most 
interesting are shorter pieces performed in country places in comparatively 
recent times, and probably largely traditional in substance. Christianity by the 
fourteenth century had at last gained a real hold upon the German people, or 
perhaps one should rather say the German people had laid a strong hold upon 
Christianity, moulding it into something very human and concrete, materialistic 
often, yet not without spiritual significance. In cradle-rocking and religious 
dancing at Christmas the instincts of a lusty, kindly race expressed themselves, 
and the same character is shown in the short popular Christmas dramas collected 
by Weinhold and others.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-29">5-29</A><a name="Nanchor_5-29"></A> Many of the little pieces&#65279;&#8212;some are rather duets than 
plays&#65279;&#8212;were sung or acted in church or by the fireside in the nineteenth 
century, and perhaps even now may linger in remote places. They are in dialect, 
and the rusticity of their language harmonizes well with their na&iuml;ve, homely 
sentiment. In them we behold the scenes of Bethlehem as realized by peasants, 
and their mixture of rough humour and tender feeling is thoroughly in keeping 
with the subject.</P>
<P>One is made to feel very vividly the amazement of the shepherds at the 
wondrous and sudden apparition of the angels:&#65279;&#8212;</P>

<P>Far more interesting in their realism and naturalness are these little plays 
of the common folk than the elaborate Christmas dramas of more learned German 
writers, Catholic and Lutheran, who in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries 
became increasingly stilted and bombastic.</P>
<P class=thoughtbreak>The Italian religious drama&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-34">5-34</A><a name="Nanchor_5-34"></A> evolved somewhat differently from that of the 
northern countries. The later thirteenth century saw the outbreak of the 
fanaticism of the Flagellants or <I>Battuti</I>, vast crowds of people of all 
classes who went in procession from church to church, from city to city, 
scourging their naked bodies in terror and repentance till the blood flowed. 
When the wild enthusiasm of this movement subsided it left enduring traces in 
the foundation of lay communities throughout the land, continuing in a more 
sober way the penitential practices of the Flagellants. One of their aids to 
devotion was the singing or reciting of vernacular poetry, less formal than the 
Latin hymns of the liturgy, and known as <I>laude</I>.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_78">78</A><a name="FNanchor_78"></A> These <I>laude</I> developed a more or less dramatic 
form, which gained the name of <I>divozioni</I>.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_79">79</A><a name="FNanchor_79"></A> They were, perhaps (though not certainly, for there 
seems to have been another tradition derived from the regular liturgical drama), 
the source from which sprang the gorgeously produced <I>sacre 
rappresentazioni</I> of the fifteenth century.</P>
<P>The <I>sacre rappresentazioni</I> corresponded, though with considerable 
differences, to the miracle-plays of England and France. Their great period was 
the fifty years from 1470 to 1520, and <A NAME="page_147"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 147</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_147"></A>they were performed, like the <I>divozioni</I>, by 
confraternities of religious laymen. The actors were boys belonging to the 
brotherhoods, and the plays were intended to be edifying for youth. They are 
more refined than the northern religious dramas, but only too often fall into 
insipidity.</P>
<P>Among the texts given by D'Ancona in his collection of <I>sacre 
rappresentazioni</I> is a Tuscan &#8220;Nativit&agrave;,&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-36">5-36</A><a name="Nanchor_5-36"></A> opening with a pastoral scene resembling those in the 
northern mysteries, but far less vigorous. It cannot compare, for character and 
humour, with the Towneley plays. Still the shepherds, whose names are Bobi del 
Farucchio, Nencio di Pucchio, Randello, Nencietto, Giordano, and Falconcello, 
are at least meant to have a certain rusticity, as they feast on bread and 
cheese and wine, play to the Saviour on bagpipe or whistle, and offer humble 
presents like apples and cheese. The scenes which follow, the coming of the Magi 
and the Murder of the Innocents, are not intrinsically of great interest.</P>
<P>It is possible that this play may have been the spectacle performed in 
Florence in 1466, as recorded by Machiavelli, &#8220;to give men something to take 
away their thoughts from affairs of state.&#8221; It &#8220;represented the coming of the 
three Magi Kings from the East, following the star which showed the Nativity of 
Christ, and it was of so great pomp and magnificence that it kept the whole city 
busy for several months in arranging and preparing it.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-37">5-37</A><a name="Nanchor_5-37"></A> </P>
<P>An earlier record of an Italian pageant of the Magi is this account by the 
chronicler Galvano Flamma of what took place at Milan in 1336:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&#8220;There were three kings crowned, on great horses, ... and an exceeding 
  great train. And there was a golden star running through the air, which went 
  before these three kings, and they came to the columns of San Lorenzo, where 
  was King Herod in effigy, with the scribes and wise men. And they were seen to 
  ask King Herod where Christ was born, and having turned over many books they 
  answered, that He should be born in the city of David distant five miles from 
  Jerusalem. And having heard this, those three kings, crowned with golden 
  crowns, holding in their hands golden cups with gold, incense, <A NAME="page_148"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 148</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_148"></A>and myrrh, came to the church of Sant&#146; Eustorgio, the 
  star preceding them through the air, ... and a wonderful train, with 
  resounding trumpets and horns going before them, with apes, baboons, and 
  diverse kinds of animals, and a marvellous tumult of people. There at the side 
  of the high altar was a manger with ox and ass, and in the manger was the 
  little Christ in the arms of the Virgin Mother. And those kings offered gifts 
  unto Christ; then they were seen to sleep, and a winged angel said to them 
  that they should not return by the region of San Lorenzo but by the Porta 
  Romana; which also was done. There was so great a concourse of the people and 
  soldiers and ladies and clerics that scarce anything like it was ever beheld. 
  And it was ordered that every year this festal show should be performed.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-38">5-38</A><a name="Nanchor_5-38"></A> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>How suggestive this is of the Magi pictures of the fifteenth century, with 
their gorgeous eastern monarchs and retinues of countless servants and strange 
animals. No other story in the New Testament gives such opportunity for 
pageantry as the Magi scene. All the wonder, richness, and romance of the East, 
all the splendour of western Renaissance princes could lawfully be introduced 
into the train of the Three Kings. With Gentile da Fabriano and Benozzo Gozzoli 
it has become a magnificent procession; there are trumpeters, pages, jesters, 
dwarfs, exotic beasts&#65279;&#8212;all the motley, gorgeous retinue of the monarchs of the 
time, while the kings themselves are romantic figures in richest attire, velvet, 
brocade, wrought gold, and jewels. It may be that much of this splendour was 
suggested to the painters by dramatic spectacles which actually passed before 
their eyes.</P>
<P class=thoughtbreak>I have already alluded to the Spanish &#8220;Mystery of the Magi 
Kings,&#8221; a mere fragment, but of peculiar interest to the historian of the drama 
as one of the two earliest religious plays in a modern European language. Though 
plays are known to have been performed in Spain at Christmas and Easter in the 
Middle Ages,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-39">5-39</A><a name="Nanchor_5-39"></A> we have no further texts until the very short 
&#8220;Representation of the Birth of Our Lord,&#8221; by G&oacute;mez Manrique, Se&ntilde;or de 
Villazopeque (1412-91), acted at the convent at Calabazanos, of which the 
author's sister was Superior. The characters <A NAME="page_149"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 149</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_149"></A>introduced are the Virgin, St. Joseph, St. Gabriel, St. 
Michael, St. Raphael, another angel, and three shepherds.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-40">5-40</A><a name="Nanchor_5-40"></A> </P>
<P>Touched by the spirit of the Renaissance, and particularly by the influence 
of Virgil, is Juan del Encina of Salamanca (1469-1534), court poet to the Duke 
of Alba, and author of two Christmas eclogues.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-41">5-41</A><a name="Nanchor_5-41"></A> The first introduces four shepherds who bear the 
names of the Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and are curiously mixed 
personages, their words being half what might be expected from the shepherds of 
Bethlehem and half sayings proper only to the authors of the Gospels. It ends 
with a <I>villancico</I> or carol. The second eclogue is far more realistic, and 
indeed resembles the English and French pastoral scenes. The shepherds grumble 
about the weather&#65279;&#8212;it has been raining for two months, the floods are terrible, 
and no fords or bridges are left; they talk of the death of a sacristan, a fine 
singer; and they play a game with chestnuts; then comes the angel&#65279;&#8212;whom one of 
them calls a &#8220;smartly dressed lad&#8221; (<I>garzon rep&igrave;cado</I>)&#65279;&#8212;to tell them of the 
Birth, and they go to adore the Child, taking Him a kid, butter-cakes, eggs, and 
other presents.</P>
<P>Infinitely more ambitious is &#8220;The Birth of Christ&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-42">5-42</A><a name="Nanchor_5-42"></A> by the great Lope de Vega (1562-1635). It opens in 
Paradise, immediately after the Creation, and ends with the adoration of the 
Three Kings. Full of allegorical conceits and personified qualities, it will 
hardly please the taste of modern minds. Another work of Lope's, &#8220;The Shepherds 
of Bethlehem,&#8221; a long pastoral in prose and verse, published in 1612, contains, 
amid many incongruities, some of the best of his shorter poems; one lullaby, 
sung by the Virgin in a palm-grove while her Child sleeps, has been thus 
translated by Ticknor:&#65279;&#8212;</P>

<P class=thoughtbreak>Apart from such modern revivals of the Christmas drama as 
Mr. Laurence Housman's &#8220;Bethlehem,&#8221; Miss Buckton's &#8220;Eager Heart,&#8221; Mrs. Percy 
Dearmer's &#8220;The Soul of the World,&#8221; and similar experiments in Germany and 
France, a genuine tradition has lingered on in some parts of Europe into modern 
times. We have already noticed some French and German instances; to these may be 
added a few from other countries.</P>
<P>In Naples there is no Christmas without the &#8220;Cantata dei pastori&#8221;; it is 
looked forward to no less than the Midnight Mass. Two or three theatres compete 
for the public favour in the performance of this play in rude verse. It begins 
with Adam and Eve and ends with the birth of Jesus and the adoration of the 
shepherds. Many devils are brought on the stage, their arms and legs laden with 
brass chains that rattle horribly. Awful are their names, Lucifero, Satanasso, 
Belfegor, Belzeb&ugrave;, &amp;c. They not only tempt Adam and Eve, but annoy the 
Virgin and St. Joseph, until an angel comes and frightens them away. Two 
non-Biblical figures are introduced, Razzullo and Sarchiapone, who are tempted 
by devils and aided by angels.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-44">5-44</A><a name="Nanchor_5-44"></A> In Sicily too the Christmas play still lingers under 
the name of <I>Pastorale</I>.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-45">5-45</A><a name="Nanchor_5-45"></A> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_151"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 151</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_151"></A>A nineteenth-century Spanish survival of the &#8220;Stella&#8221; is 
described in Fernan Caballero's sketch, &#8220;La Noche de Navidad.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-46">5-46</A><a name="Nanchor_5-46"></A> At the foot of the altar of the village church, 
according to this account, images of the Virgin and St. Joseph were placed, with 
the Holy Child between them, lying on straw. On either side knelt a small boy 
dressed as an angel. Solemnly there entered the church a number of men attired 
as shepherds, bearing their offerings to the Child; afterwards they danced with 
slow and dignified movements before the altar. The shepherds were followed by 
the richest men of the village dressed as the Magi Kings, mounted on horseback, 
and followed by their train. Before them went a shining star. On reaching the 
church they dismounted; the first, representing a majestic old man with white 
hair, offered incense to the Babe; the others, Caspar and Melchior, myrrh and 
gold respectively. This was done on the feast of the Epiphany.</P>
<P>A remnant possibly of the &#8220;Stella&#8221; is to be found in a Christmas custom 
extremely widespread in Europe and surviving even in some Protestant lands&#65279;&#8212;the 
carrying about of a star in memory of the Star of Bethlehem. It is generally 
borne by a company of boys, who sing some sort of carol, and expect a gift in 
return.</P>
<P>The practice is&#65279;&#8212;or was&#65279;&#8212;found as far north as Sweden. All through the 
Christmas season the &#8220;star youths&#8221; go about from house to house. Three are 
dressed up as the Magi Kings, a fourth carries on a stick a paper lantern in the 
form of a six-pointed star, made to revolve and lighted by candles. There are 
also a Judas, who bears the purse for the collection, and, occasionally, a King 
Herod. A doggerel rhyme is sung, telling the story of the Nativity and offering 
good wishes.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-47">5-47</A><a name="Nanchor_5-47"></A> In Norway and Denmark processions of a like character 
were formerly known.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-48">5-48</A><a name="Nanchor_5-48"></A> </P>
<P>In Normandy at Christmas children used to go singing through the village 
streets, carrying a lantern of coloured paper on a long osier rod.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-49">5-49</A><a name="Nanchor_5-49"></A> At Pleudihen in Brittany three young men representing 
the Magi sang carols in the cottages, dressed in their holiday clothes covered 
with ribbons.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-50">5-50</A><a name="Nanchor_5-50"></A> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_152"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 152</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_152"></A>In England there appears to be no trace of the custom, 
which is however found in Germany, Austria, Holland, Italy, Bohemia, Roumania, 
Poland, and Russia.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-51">5-51</A><a name="Nanchor_5-51"></A> </P>
<P>In Thuringia a curious carol used to be sung, telling how Herod tried to 
tempt the Wise Men&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i15>&#8220;&#145;Oh, good Wise Men, come in and 
dine;</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>I will give you both beer and 
wine,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>And hay and straw to make your 
bed,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>And nought of payment shall be 
said.&#146;&#8221;</SPAN><BR></DIV></DIV>
<P>But they answer:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i15>&#8220;&#145;Oh, no! oh, no! we must 
away,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>We seek a little Child to-day,</SPAN><BR><SPAN  class=i2>A little Child, a mighty King,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>Him who created 
everything.&#146;&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-52">5-52</A><a name="Nanchor_5-52"></A> </SPAN><BR></DIV></DIV>
<P>In Tyrol the &#8220;star-singing&#8221; is very much alive at the present day. In the 
Upper Innthal three boys in white robes, with blackened faces and gold paper 
crowns, go to every house on Epiphany Eve, one of them carrying a golden star on 
a pole. They sing a carol, half religious, half comic&#65279;&#8212;almost a little 
drama&#65279;&#8212;and are given money, cake, and drink. In the Ilsethal the boys come on 
Christmas Eve, and presents are given them by well-to-do people. In some parts 
there is but one singer, an old man with a white beard and a turban, who twirls 
a revolving star. A remarkable point about the Tyrolese star-singers is that 
before anything is given them they are told to stamp on the snowy fields outside 
the houses, in order to promote the growth of the crops in summer.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-53">5-53</A><a name="Nanchor_5-53"></A> </P>
<P>In Little Russia the &#8220;star&#8221; is made of pasteboard and has a transparent 
centre with a picture of Christ through which the light of a candle shines. One 
boy carries the star and another twirls the points.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-54">5-54</A><a name="Nanchor_5-54"></A> In Roumania it is made of wood and adorned with 
frills and little bells. A representation of the &#8220;manger,&#8221; illuminated from 
behind, forms the centre, and the star also shows pictures of Adam and Eve and 
angels.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-55">5-55</A><a name="Nanchor_5-55"></A> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_153"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 153</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_153"></A>A curious traditional drama, in which pagan elements seem 
to have mingled with the Herod story, is still performed by the Roumanians 
during the Christmas festival. It is called in Wallachia &#8220;Vicleim&#8221; (from 
Bethlehem), in Moldavia and Transylvania &#8220;Irozi&#8221; (plural from <I>Irod</I> = 
Herod). At least ten persons figure in it: &#8220;Emperor&#8221; Herod, an old grumbling 
monarch who speaks in harsh tones to his followers; an officer and two soldiers 
in Roman attire; the three Magi, in Oriental garb, a child, and &#8220;two comical 
figures&#65279;&#8212;the <I>paia&#355;a</I> (the clown) and the <I>mo&#351;ul</I>, or old man, the 
former in harlequin accoutrement, the latter with a mask on his face, a long 
beard, a hunch on his back, and dressed in a sheepskin with the wool on the 
outside. The plot of the play is quite simple. The officer brings the news that 
three strange men have been caught, going to Bethlehem to adore the new-born 
Messiah; Herod orders them to be shown in: they enter singing in a choir. Long 
dialogues ensue between them and Herod, who at last orders them to be taken to 
prison. But then they address the Heavenly Father, and shout imprecations on 
Herod, invoking celestial punishment on him, at which unaccountable noises are 
heard, seeming to announce the fulfilment of the curse. Herod falters, begs the 
Wise Men's forgiveness, putting off his anger till more opportune times. The 
Wise Men retire.... Then a child is introduced, who goes on his knees before 
Herod, with his hands on his breast, asking pity. He gives clever answers to 
various questions and foretells the Christ's future career, at which Herod stabs 
him. The whole troupe now strikes up a tune of reproach to Herod, who falls on 
his knees in deep repentance.&#8221; The play is sometimes performed by puppets 
instead of living actors.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-56">5-56</A><a name="Nanchor_5-56"></A> </P>
<P>Christmas plays performed by puppets are found in other countries too. In 
Poland &#8220;during the week between Christmas and New Year is shown the 
<I>Jaselki</I> or manger, a travelling series of scenes from the life of Christ 
or even of modern peasants, a small travelling puppet-theatre, gorgeous with 
tinsel and candles, and something like our &#145;Punch and Judy&#146; show. The 
market-place of Cracow, especially at night, is a very pretty spectacle, its 
sidewalks all lined with these glittering Jaselki.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-57">5-57</A><a name="Nanchor_5-57"></A> In Madrid <A NAME="page_154"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 154</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_154"></A>at the Epiphany a puppet-play was common, in which the 
events of the Nativity and the Infancy were mimed by wooden figures,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-58">5-58</A><a name="Nanchor_5-58"></A> and in Provence, in the mid-nineteenth century, the 
Christmas scenes were represented in the same way.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-59">5-59</A><a name="Nanchor_5-59"></A> </P>
<P>Last may be mentioned a curious Mexican mixture of religion and amusement, a 
sort of drama called the &#8220;Posadas,&#8221; described by Madame Calderon de la Barca in 
her &#8220;Life in Mexico&#8221; (1843).&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-60">5-60</A><a name="Nanchor_5-60"></A> The custom was based upon the wanderings of the 
Virgin and St. Joseph in Bethlehem in search of repose. For eight days these 
wanderings of the holy pair to the different <I>posadas</I> were represented. On 
Christmas Eve, says the narrator, &#8220;a lighted candle was put into the hand of 
each lady [this was at a sort of party], and a procession was formed, two by 
two, which marched all through the house ... the whole party singing the 
Litanies.... A group of little children, dressed as angels, joined the 
procession.... At last the procession drew up before a door, and a shower of 
fireworks was sent flying over our heads, I suppose to represent the descent of 
the angels; for a group of ladies appeared, dressed to represent the 
shepherds.... Then voices, supposed to be those of Mary and Joseph, struck up a 
hymn, in which they begged for admittance, saying that the night was cold and 
dark, that the wind blew hard, and that they prayed for a night's shelter. A 
chorus of voices from within refused admittance. Again those without entreated 
shelter, and at length declared that she at the door, who thus wandered in the 
night, and had not where to lay her head, was the Queen of Heaven! At this name 
the doors were thrown wide open, and the Holy Family entered singing. The scene 
within was very pretty: a <I>nacimiento</I>.... One of the angels held a waxen 
baby in her arms.... A padre took the baby from the angel and placed it in the 
cradle, and the <I>posada</I> was completed. We then returned to the 
drawing-room&#65279;&#8212;angels, shepherds, and all, and danced till supper-time.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-60">5-60</A> 
Here the religious drama has sunk to little more than a &#8220;Society&#8221; game.</P>
