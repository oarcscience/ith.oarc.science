<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN class=smcap>The Christmas-tree.</SPAN></H3>
<P>The most widespread, and to children the most delightful, of all festal 
institutions is the Christmas-tree. Its picturesqueness and gay charm have made 
it spread rapidly all over Europe without roots in national tradition, for, as 
most people know, it is a German creation, and even in Germany it attained its 
present immense popularity only in the nineteenth century. To Germany, of 
course, one should go to see the tree in all its glory. Many people, indeed, 
maintain that no other Christmas can compare with the German <I>Weihnacht</I>. 
&#8220;It is,&#8221; writes Miss I. A. R. Wylie, &#8220;that childish, open-hearted simplicity 
which, so it seems to me, makes Christmas essentially German, or at any rate 
explains why it is that nowhere else in the world does it find so pure an 
expression. The German is himself simple, warm-hearted, unpretentious, with 
something at the bottom of him which is childlike in the best sense. He is the 
last &#145;Naturmensch&#146; in civilization.&#8221; Christmas suits him &#8220;as well as a play 
suits an actor for whose character and temperament it has been especially 
written.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-1">12-1</A><a name="Nanchor_12-1"></A> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_264"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 264</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_264"></A>In Germany the Christmas-tree is not a luxury for 
well-to-do people as in England, but a necessity, the very centre of the 
festival; no one is too poor or too lonely to have one. There is something about 
a German <I>Weihnachtsbaum</I>&#65279;&#8212;a romance and a wonder&#65279;&#8212;that English 
Christmas-trees do not possess. For one thing, perhaps, in a land of forests the 
tree seems more in place; it is a kind of sacrament linking mankind to the 
mysteries of the woodland. Again the German tree is simply a thing of beauty and 
radiance; no utilitarian presents hang from its boughs&#65279;&#8212;they are laid apart on a 
table&#65279;&#8212;and the tree is purely splendour for splendour's sake. However tawdry it 
may look by day, at night it is a true thing of wonder, shining with countless 
lights and glittering ornaments, with fruit of gold and shimmering festoons of 
silver. Then there is the solemnity with which it is surrounded; the long secret 
preparations behind the closed doors, and, when Christmas Eve arrives, the 
sudden revelation of hidden glory. The Germans have quite a religious feeling 
for their <I>Weihnachtsbaum</I>, coming down, one may fancy, from some dim 
ancestral worship of the trees of the wood.</P>
<P>As Christmas draws near the market-place in a German town is filled with a 
miniature forest of firs; the trees are sold by old women in quaint costumes, 
and the shop-windows are full of candles and ornaments to deck them. Mrs. Alfred 
Sidgwick in her &#8220;Home Life in Germany&#8221; gives a delightful picture of such a 
Christmas market in &#8220;one of the old German cities in the hill country, when the 
streets and the open places are covered with crisp clean snow, and the mountains 
are white with it.... The air is cold and still, and heavy with the scent of the 
Christmas-trees brought from the forest for the pleasure of the children. Day by 
day you see the rows of them growing thinner, and if you go to the market on 
Christmas Eve itself you will find only a few trees left out in the cold. The 
market is empty, the peasants are harnessing their horses or their oxen, the 
women are packing up their unsold goods. In every home in the city one of the 
trees that scented the open air a week ago is shining now with lights and little 
gilded nuts and apples, and is helping to make that Christmas smell, all compact 
of the pine forest, wax <A NAME="page_265"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 265</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_265"></A>candles, cakes and painted toys, you must associate so long 
as you live with Christmas in Germany.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-2">12-2</A><a name="Nanchor_12-2"></A> </P>
<P>Even in London one may get a glimpse of the Teutonic Christmas in the 
half-German streets round Fitzroy Square. They are bald and drab enough, but at 
Christmas here and there a window shines with a lighted tree, and the very 
prosaic Lutheran church in Cleveland Street has an unwonted sight to show&#65279;&#8212;two 
great fir-trees decked with white candles, standing one on each side of the 
pulpit. The church of the German Catholics, too, St. Boniface's, Whitechapel, 
has in its sanctuary two Christmas-trees strangely gay with coloured glistening 
balls and long strands of gold and silver <I>engelshaar</I>. The candles are lit 
at Benediction during the festival, and between the shining trees the solemn 
ritual is performed by the priest and a crowd of serving boys in scarlet and 
white with tapers and incense.</P>
<P class=thoughtbreak>There is a pretty story about the institution of the 
<I>Weihnachtsbaum</I> by Martin Luther: how, after wandering one Christmas Eve 
under the clear winter sky lit by a thousand stars, he set up for his children a 
tree with countless candles, an image of the starry heaven whence Christ came 
down. This, however, belongs to the region of legend; the first historical 
mention of the Christmas-tree is found in the notes of a certain Strasburg 
citizen of unknown name, written in the year 1605. &#8220;At Christmas,&#8221; he writes, 
&#8220;they set up fir-trees in the parlours at Strasburg and hang thereon roses cut 
out of many-coloured paper, apples, wafers, gold-foil, sweets, &amp;c.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-3">12-3</A><a name="Nanchor_12-3"></A> </P>
<P>We next meet with the tree in a hostile allusion by a distinguished Strasburg 
theologian, Dr. Johann Konrad Dannhauer, Professor and Preacher at the 
Cathedral. In his book, &#8220;The Milk of the Catechism,&#8221; published about the middle 
of the seventeenth century, he speaks of &#8220;the Christmas- or fir-tree, which 
people set up in their houses, hang with dolls and sweets, and afterwards shake 
and deflower.&#8221; &#8220;Whence comes the custom,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I know not; it is child's 
play.... Far better were it to point the children to the spiritual cedar-tree, 
Jesus Christ.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-4">12-4</A><a name="Nanchor_12-4"></A> </P>
<P>In neither of these references is there any mention of candles&#65279;&#8212;the <A NAME="page_266"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 266</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_266"></A>most fascinating feature of the modern tree. These appear, 
however, in a Latin work on Christmas presents by Karl Gottfried Kissling of the 
University of Wittenberg, written in 1737. He tells how a certain country lady 
of his acquaintance set up a little tree for each of her sons and daughters, lit 
candles on or around the trees, laid out presents beneath them, and called her 
children one by one into the room to take the trees and gifts intended for 
them.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-5">12-5</A><a name="Nanchor_12-5"></A> </P>
<P>With the advance of the eighteenth-century notices of the 
<I>Weihnachtsbaum</I> become more frequent: Jung Stilling, Goethe, Schiller, and 
others mention it, and about the end of the century its use seems to have been 
fairly general in Germany.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-6">12-6</A><a name="Nanchor_12-6"></A> In many places, however, it was not common till well 
on in the eighteen hundreds: it was a Protestant rather than a Catholic 
institution, and it made its way but slowly in regions where the older faith was 
held.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-7">12-7</A><a name="Nanchor_12-7"></A> Well-to-do townspeople welcomed it first, and the 
peasantry were slow to adopt it. In Old Bavaria, for instance, in 1855 it was 
quite unknown in country places, and even to-day it is not very common there, 
except in the towns.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-8">12-8</A><a name="Nanchor_12-8"></A> &#8220;It is more in vogue on the whole,&#8221; wrote Dr. Tille in 
1893, &#8220;in the Protestant north than in the Catholic south,&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-9">12-9</A><a name="Nanchor_12-9"></A> but its popularity was rapidly growing at that 
time.</P>
<P>A common substitute for the Christmas-tree in Saxony during the nineteenth 
century, and one still found in country places, was the so-called &#8220;pyramid,&#8221; a 
wooden erection adorned with many-coloured paper and with lights. These pyramids 
were very popular among the smaller <I>bourgeoisie</I> and artisans, and were 
kept from one Christmas to another.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-10">12-10</A><a name="Nanchor_12-10"></A> In Berlin, too, the pyramid was once very common. It 
was there adorned with green twigs as well as with candles and coloured paper, 
and had more resemblance to the Christmas-tree.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-11">12-11</A><a name="Nanchor_12-11"></A> Tieck refers to it in his story, &#8220;Weihnacht-Abend&#8221; 
(1805).&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-12">12-12</A><a name="Nanchor_12-12"></A> </P>
<P>Pyramids, without lights apparently, were known in England before 1840. In 
Hertfordshire they were formed of gilt evergreens, apples, and nuts, and were 
carried about just before Christmas for presents. In Herefordshire they were 
known at the New Year.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-13">12-13</A><a name="Nanchor_12-13"></A> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_267"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 267</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_267"></A>The Christmas-tree was introduced into France in 1840, when 
Princess Helene of Mecklenburg brought it to Paris. In 1890 between thirty and 
thirty-five thousand of the trees are said to have been sold in Paris.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-14">12-14</A><a name="Nanchor_12-14"></A> </P>
<P>In England it is alluded to in 1789,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-15">12-15</A><a name="Nanchor_12-15"></A> but its use did not become at all general until 
about the eighteen-forties. In 1840 Queen Victoria and Prince Albert had a 
Christmas-tree, and the fashion spread until it became completely 
naturalized.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-16">12-16</A><a name="Nanchor_12-16"></A> In Denmark and Norway it was known in 1830, and in 
Sweden in 1863 (among the Swedish population on the coast of Finland it seems to 
have been in use in 1800).&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-17">12-17</A><a name="Nanchor_12-17"></A> In Bohemia it is mentioned in 1862.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-18">12-18</A><a name="Nanchor_12-18"></A> It is also found in Russia, the United States, 
Spain, Italy, and Holland,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-19">12-19</A><a name="Nanchor_12-19"></A> and of course in Switzerland and Austria, so largely 
German in language and customs. In non-German countries it is rather a thing for 
the well-to-do classes than for the masses of the people.</P>
<P>The Christmas-tree is essentially a domestic institution. It has, however, 
found its way into Protestant churches in Germany and from them into Catholic 
churches. Even the Swiss Zwinglians, with all their Puritanism, do not exclude 
it from their bare, white-washed fanes. In the M&uuml;nsterthal, for instance, a 
valley of Romonsch speech, off the Lower Engadine, a tree decked with candles, 
festoons, presents, and serpent-squibs, stands in church at Christmas, and it is 
difficult for the minister to conduct service, for all the time, except during 
the prayers, the people are letting off fireworks. On one day between Christmas 
Eve and New Year there is a great present-giving in church.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-20">12-20</A><a name="Nanchor_12-20"></A> </P>
<P>In Munich, and doubtless elsewhere, the tree appears not only in the church 
and in the home, but in the cemetery. The graves of the dead are decked on 
Christmas Eve with holly and mistletoe and a little Christmas-tree with gleaming 
lights, a touching token of remembrance, an attempt, perhaps, to give the 
departed a share in the brightness of the festival.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-21">12-21</A><a name="Nanchor_12-21"></A> </P>
<P class=thoughtbreak>The question of the origin of Christmas-trees is of great 
interest. Though their affinity to other sacraments of the <A NAME="page_268"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 268</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_268"></A>vegetation-spirit is evident, it is difficult to be certain 
of their exact ancestry. Dr. Tille regards them as coming from a union of two 
elements: the old Roman custom of decking houses with laurels and green trees at 
the Kalends of January, and the popular belief that every Christmas Eve apple 
and other trees blossomed and bore fruit.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-22">12-22</A><a name="Nanchor_12-22"></A> </P>
<P>Before the advent of the Christmas-tree proper&#65279;&#8212;a fir with lights and 
ornaments often imitating and always suggesting flowers and fruit&#65279;&#8212;it was 
customary to put trees like cherry or hawthorn into water or into pots indoors, 
so that they might bud and blossom at New Year or Christmas.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-23">12-23</A><a name="Nanchor_12-23"></A> Even to-day the practice of picking boughs in order 
that they may blossom at Christmas is to be found in some parts of Austria. In 
Carinthia girls on St. Lucia's Day (December&nbsp;13) stick a cherry-branch into 
wet sand; if it blooms at Christmas their wishes will be fulfilled. In other 
parts the branches&#65279;&#8212;pear as well as cherry&#65279;&#8212;are picked on St. Barbara's Day 
(December&nbsp;4), and in South Tyrol cherry-trees are manured with lime on the 
first Thursday in Advent so that they may blossom at Christmas.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-24">12-24</A><a name="Nanchor_12-24"></A> The custom may have had to do with legendary lore 
about the marvellous transformation of Nature on the night of Christ's birth, 
when the rivers ran wine instead of water and trees stood in full blossom in 
spite of ice and snow.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-25">12-25</A><a name="Nanchor_12-25"></A> </P>
<P>In England there was an old belief in trees blossoming at Christmas, 
connected with the well-known legend of St. Joseph of Arimathea. When the saint 
settled at Glastonbury he planted his staff in the earth and it put forth 
leaves; moreover it blossomed every Christmas Eve. Not only the original thorn 
at Glastonbury but trees of the same species in other parts of England had this 
characteristic. When in 1752 the New Style was substituted for the Old, making 
Christmas fall twelve days earlier, folks were curious to see what the thorns 
would do. At Quainton in Buckinghamshire two thousand people, it is said, went 
out on the new Christmas Eve to view a blackthorn which had the Christmas 
blossoming habit. As no sign of buds was visible they agreed that the new 
Christmas could not be right, and refused to keep it. At Glastonbury itself 
nothing <A NAME="page_269"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 269</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_269"></A>happened on December&nbsp;24, but on January&nbsp;5, the 
right day according to the Old Style, the thorn blossomed as usual.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_102">102</A><a name="FNanchor_102"></A>&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-26">12-26</A><a name="Nanchor_12-26"></A> </P>
<P>Let us turn to the customs of the Roman Empire which may be in part 
responsible for the German Christmas-tree. The practice of adorning houses with 
evergreens at the January Kalends was common throughout the Empire, as we learn 
from Libanius, Tertullian, and Chrysostom. A grim denunciation of such 
decorations and the lights which accompanied them may be quoted from Tertullian; 
it makes a pregnant contrast of pagan and Christian. &#8220;Let them,&#8221; he says of the 
heathen, &#8220;kindle lamps, they who have no light; let them fix on the doorposts 
laurels which shall afterwards be burnt, they for whom fire is close at hand; 
meet for them are testimonies of darkness and auguries of punishment. But thou,&#8221; 
he says to the Christian, &#8220;art a light of the world and a tree that is ever 
green; if thou hast renounced temples, make not a temple of thy own 
house-door.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-27">12-27</A><a name="Nanchor_12-27"></A> </P>
<P>That these New Year practices of the Empire had to do with the 
<I>Weihnachtsbaum</I> is very possible, but on the other hand it has closer 
parallels in certain folk-customs that in no way suggest Roman or Greek 
influence. Not only at Christmas are ceremonial &#8220;trees&#8221; to be found in Germany. 
In the Erzgebirge there is dancing at the summer solstice round &#8220;St. John's 
tree,&#8221; a pyramid decked with garlands and flowers, and lit up at night by 
candles.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-28">12-28</A><a name="Nanchor_12-28"></A> At midsummer &#8220;in the towns of the Upper Harz 
Mountains tall fir-trees, with the bark peeled off their lower trunks, were set 
up in open places and decked with flowers and eggs, which were painted yellow 
and red. Round these trees the young folk danced by day and the old folk in the 
evening&#8221;;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-29">12-29</A><a name="Nanchor_12-29"></A> while on Dutch ground in Gelderland and Limburg at 
the beginning of May trees were adorned with lights.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-30">12-30</A><a name="Nanchor_12-30"></A> </P>
<P>Nearer to Christmas is a New Year's custom found in some <A NAME="page_270"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 270</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_270"></A>Alsatian villages: the adorning of the fountain with a 
&#8220;May.&#8221; The girls who visit the fountain procure a small fir-tree or holly-bush, 
and deck it with ribbons, egg-shells, and little figures representing a shepherd 
or a man beating his wife. This is set up above the fountain on New Year's Eve. 
On the evening of the next day the snow is carefully cleared away and the girls 
dance and sing around the fountain. The lads may only take part in the dance by 
permission of the girls. The tree is kept all through the year as a protection 
to those who have set it up.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-31">12-31</A><a name="Nanchor_12-31"></A> </P>
<P>In Sweden, before the advent of the German type of tree, it was customary to 
place young pines, divested of bark and branches, outside the houses at 
Christmastide.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-32">12-32</A><a name="Nanchor_12-32"></A> An English parallel which does not suggest any 
borrowing from Germany, was formerly to be found at Brough in Westmoreland on 
Twelfth Night. A holly-tree with torches attached to its branches was carried 
through the town in procession. It was finally thrown among the populace, who 
divided into two parties, one of which endeavoured to take the tree to one inn, 
and the other, to a rival hostelry.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-33">12-33</A><a name="Nanchor_12-33"></A> We have here pretty plainly a struggle of two 
factions&#65279;&#8212;perhaps of two quarters of a town that were once separate 
villages&#65279;&#8212;for the possession of a sacred object.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_103">103</A><a name="FNanchor_103"></A></P>
<P>We may find parallels, lastly, in two remote corners of Europe. In the island 
of Chios&#65279;&#8212;here we are on Greek ground&#65279;&#8212;tenants are wont to offer to their 
landlords on Christmas morning a <I>rhamna</I>, a pole with wreaths of myrtle, 
olive, and orange leaves bound around it; &#8220;to these are fixed any flowers that 
may be found&#65279;&#8212;geraniums, anemones, and the like, and, by way of further 
decoration, oranges, lemons, and strips of gold and coloured paper.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_104">104</A><a name="FNanchor_104"></A>&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-34">12-34</A><a name="Nanchor_12-34"></A> Secondly, among the Circassians in the early half of 
the nineteenth century, a young pear-tree used to be carried into each house at 
an autumn festival, to the sound of music and joyous cries. It was covered with 
candles, and a cheese was fastened to its top. Round about it they ate, drank, 
and sang. Afterwards it was <A NAME="page_271"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 271</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_271"></A>removed to the courtyard, where it remained for the rest of 
the year.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-36">12-36</A><a name="Nanchor_12-36"></A> </P>
<P>Though there is no recorded instance of the use of a tree at Christmas in 
Germany before the seventeenth century, the <I>Weihnachtsbaum</I> may well be a 
descendant of some sacred tree carried about or set up at the 
beginning-of-winter festival. All things considered, it seems to belong to a 
class of primitive sacraments of which the example most familiar to English 
peoples is the May-pole. This is, of course, an early summer institution, but in 
France and Germany a Harvest May is also known&#65279;&#8212;a large branch or a whole tree, 
which is decked with ears of corn, brought home on the last waggon from the 
harvest field, and fastened to the roof of farmhouse or barn, where it remains 
for a year.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-37">12-37</A><a name="Nanchor_12-37"></A> Mannhardt has shown that such sacraments embody the 
tree-spirit conceived as the spirit of vegetation in general, and are believed 
to convey its life-giving, fructifying influences. Probably the idea of contact 
with the spirit of growth lay also beneath the Roman evergreen decorations, so 
that whether or not we connect the Christmas-tree with these, the principle at 
the bottom is the same.</P>
<P>Certain Christian ideas, finally, besides that of trees blossoming on the 
night of the Nativity, may have affected the fortunes of the Christmas-tree. 
December&nbsp;24 was in old Church calendars the day of Adam and Eve, the idea 
being that Christ the second Adam had repaired by His Incarnation the loss 
caused by the sin of the first. A legend grew up that Adam when he left Paradise 
took with him an apple or sprout from the Tree of Knowledge, and that from this 
sprang the tree from which the Cross was made. Or it was said that on Adam's 
grave grew a sprig from the Tree of Life, and that from it Christ plucked the 
fruit of redemption. The Cross in early Christian poetry was conceived as the 
Tree of Life planted anew, bearing the glorious fruit of Christ's body, and 
repairing the mischief wrought by the misuse of the first tree. We may recall a 
verse from the &#8220;Pange, lingua&#8221; of Passiontide:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i15>&#8220;Faithful Cross! above all

<P>In the religious Christmas plays the tree of Paradise was sometimes shown to 
the people. At Oberufer, for instance, it was a fine juniper-tree, adorned with 
apples and ribbons. Sometimes Christ Himself was regarded as the tree of 
Paradise.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-38">12-38</A><a name="Nanchor_12-38"></A> The thought of Him as both the Light of the World 
and the Tree of Life may at least have given a Christian meaning to the 
light-bearing tree, and helped to establish its popularity among pious folk.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN class=smcap>Christmas Decorations.</SPAN></H3>
<P>We have seen that the Christmas-tree may be a development, partly at least, 
from the custom of decorating buildings with evergreens at the New Year, and 
that such decorations were common throughout the Roman Empire.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_105">105</A><a name="FNanchor_105"></A> Some further consideration may now be given to the 
subject of Christmas decorations in various lands. In winter, when all is brown 
and dead, the evergreens are manifestations of the abiding life within the 
plant-world, and they may well have been used as sacramental means of contact 
with the spirit of growth and fertility, threatened by the powers of blight. 
Particularly precious would be plants like the holly, the ivy, and the 
mistletoe, which actually bore fruit in the winter-time.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-39">12-39</A><a name="Nanchor_12-39"></A> </P>
<P>In spite of ecclesiastical condemnations of Kalends decorations&#65279;&#8212;as late as 
the sixth century the <I>capitula</I> of Bishop Martin of Braga forbid the 
adorning of houses with laurels and green trees&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-40">12-40</A><a name="Nanchor_12-40"></A> &#65279;&#8212;the custom has found its way even into churches, 
and nowhere more than in England. At least as far back as the fifteenth century, 
according to Stow's &#8220;Survay of London,&#8221; it was the custom at Christmas for 
&#8220;every man's house, as also the parish churches,&#8221; to be &#8220;decked with holm, ivy, 
bays, and whatsoever the season of the year afforded to be green. The conduits 
and <A NAME="page_273"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 273</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_273"></A>standards in the streets were likewise garnished.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-41">12-41</A><a name="Nanchor_12-41"></A> Many people of the last generation will remember the 
old English mode of decoration&#65279;&#8212;how sprigs of holly and yew, stuck into holes in 
the high pews, used to make the churches into miniature forests. Only upon the 
mistletoe does a trace of the ecclesiastical taboo remain, and even that is not 
universal, for at York Minster, for instance, some was laid upon the altar.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-42">12-42</A><a name="Nanchor_12-42"></A> </P>
<P>English popular custom has connected particular plants with the winter 
festival in a peculiarly delightful way; at the mere mention of holly or 
mistletoe the picture of Christmas with its country charm rises to the mind&#65279;&#8212;we 
think of snowy fields and distant bells, of warm hearths and kindly 
merrymaking.</P>
<P>It is no wonder that the mistletoe has a special place in Christmas 
decorations, for it is associated with both Teutonic myth and Celtic ritual. It 
was with mistletoe that the beloved Balder was shot, and the plant played an 
important part in a Druidic ceremony described by Pliny. A white-robed Druid 
climbed a sacred oak and cut the mistletoe with a golden sickle. As it fell it 
was caught in a white cloth, and two white bulls were then sacrificed, with 
prayer. The mistletoe was called &#8220;all-healer&#8221; and was believed to be a remedy 
against poison and to make barren animals fruitful.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-43">12-43</A><a name="Nanchor_12-43"></A> The significance of the ritual is not easy to find. 
Pliny's account, Dr. MacCulloch has suggested, may be incomplete, and the 
cutting of the mistletoe may have been a preliminary to some other 
ceremony&#65279;&#8212;perhaps the felling of the tree on which it grew, whose soul was 
supposed to be in it, or perhaps the slaying of a representative of the 
tree-spirit; while the white oxen of Pliny's time may have replaced a human 
victim.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-44">12-44</A><a name="Nanchor_12-44"></A> </P>
<P>It is interesting to find that the name &#8220;all-healer&#8221; is still given to the 
mistletoe in Celtic speech,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_106">106</A><a name="FNanchor_106"></A>&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-45">12-45</A><a name="Nanchor_12-45"></A> and that in various European countries it is 
believed to possess marvellous powers of healing sickness or averting 
misfortune.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-46">12-46</A><a name="Nanchor_12-46"></A> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_274"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 274</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_274"></A>It is hard to say exactly what is the origin of the English 
&#8220;kissing under the mistletoe,&#8221; but the practice would appear to be due to an 
imagined relation between the love of the sexes and the spirit of fertility 
embodied in the sacred bough, and it may be a vestige of the licence often 
permitted at folk-festivals. According to one form of the English custom the 
young men plucked, each time they kissed a girl, a berry from the bough. When 
the berries were all picked, the privilege ceased.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-48">12-48</A><a name="Nanchor_12-48"></A> </P>
<P>Sometimes a curious form, reminding one both of the German Christmas-tree and 
of the <I>Krippe</I>, is taken by the &#8220;kissing bunch.&#8221; Here is an account from 
Derbyshire:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>&#8220;The &#145;kissing bunch&#146; is always an elaborate affair. The size depends upon 
  the couple of hoops&#65279;&#8212;one thrust through the other&#65279;&#8212;which form its skeleton. 
  Each of the ribs is garlanded with holly, ivy, and sprigs of other greens, 
  with bits of coloured ribbons and paper roses, rosy-cheeked apples, specially 
  reserved for this occasion, and oranges. Three small dolls are also prepared, 
  often with much taste, and these represent our Saviour, the mother of Jesus, 
  and Joseph. These dolls generally hang within the kissing bunch by strings 
  from the top, and are surrounded by apples, oranges tied to strings, and 
  various brightly coloured ornaments. Occasionally, however, the dolls are 
  arranged in the kissing bunch to represent a manger-scene.... Mistletoe is not 
  very plentiful in Derbyshire; but, generally, a bit is obtainable, and this is 
  carefully tied to the bottom of the kissing bunch, which is then hung in the 
  middle of the house-place, the centre of attention during Christmastide.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-49">12-49</A><a name="Nanchor_12-49"></A> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Kissing under the mistletoe seems to be distinctively English. There is, 
however, a New Year's Eve custom in Lower Austria and the Rhaetian Alps that 
somewhat resembles our mistletoe bough practices. People linger late in the 
inns, the walls and windows of which are decorated with green pine-twigs. In the 
centre of the inn-parlour hangs from a roof-beam a wreath of the same greenery, 
and in a dark corner hides a masked figure known as &#8220;Sylvester,&#8221; old and ugly, 
with a flaxen beard and <I>a wreath of mistletoe</I>. If a youth or maiden 
happens to pass under the pine wreath Sylvester springs out and imprints a rough 
kiss. When midnight comes he is driven out as the representative of the old 
year.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-50">12-50</A><a name="Nanchor_12-50"></A> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_275"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 275</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_275"></A>There are traces in Britain of the sacredness of holly as 
well as mistletoe. In Northumberland it is used for divination: nine leaves are 
taken and tied with nine knots into a handkerchief, and put under the pillow by 
a person who desires prophetic dreams.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-51">12-51</A><a name="Nanchor_12-51"></A> For this purpose smooth leaves (without prickles) 
must be employed, and it is to be noted that at Burford in Shropshire smooth 
holly only was used for the Christmas decorations.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-52">12-52</A><a name="Nanchor_12-52"></A> Holly is hated by witches,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-53">12-53</A><a name="Nanchor_12-53"></A> but perhaps this may be due not to any pre-Christian 
sanctity attached to it but to the association of its thorns and blood-red 
berries with the Passion&#65279;&#8212;an association to which it owes its Danish name, 
<I>Kristdorn</I>.</P>
<P>In some old English Christmas carols holly and ivy are put into a curious 
antagonism, apparently connected with a contest of the sexes. Holly is the men's 
plant, ivy the women's, and the carols are debates as to the respective merits 
of each. Possibly some sort of rude drama may once have been performed.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-54">12-54</A><a name="Nanchor_12-54"></A> Here is a fifteenth-century example of these 
carols:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i15>&#8220;Holly and Ivy made a great

<P>The sanctity of Christmas house-decorations in England is shown by the care 
taken in disposing of them when removed from the walls. In Shropshire 
old-fashioned people never threw them away, for fear of misfortune, but either 
burnt them or gave them to the cows; it was very unlucky to let a piece <A NAME="page_276"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 276</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_276"></A>fall to the ground. The Shropshire custom was to leave the 
holly and ivy up until Candlemas, while the mistletoe-bough was carefully 
preserved until the time came for a new one next year. West Shropshire 
tradition, by the way, connects the mistletoe with the New Year rather than with 
Christmas; the bough ought not to be put up until New Year's Eve.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-56">12-56</A><a name="Nanchor_12-56"></A> </P>
<P>In Sweden green boughs, apparently, are not used for decoration, but the 
floor of the parlour is strewn with sprigs of fragrant juniper or spruce-pine, 
or with rye-straw.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-57">12-57</A><a name="Nanchor_12-57"></A> The straw was probably intended originally to bring 
to the house, by means of sacramental contact, the wholesome influences of the 
corn-spirit, though the common people connect it with the stable at Bethlehem. 
The practice of laying straw and the same Christian explanation are found also 
in Poland&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-58">12-58</A><a name="Nanchor_12-58"></A> and in Crivoscia.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-59">12-59</A><a name="Nanchor_12-59"></A> In Poland before the cloth is laid on Christmas Eve, 
the table is covered with a layer of hay or straw, and a sheaf stands in the 
corner. Years ago straw was also spread on the floor. Sometimes it is given to 
the cattle as a charm and sometimes it is used to tie up fruit-trees.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-60">12-60</A><a name="Nanchor_12-60"></A> </P>
<P>Dr. Frazer conjectures that the Swedish Yule straw comes in part at least 
from the last sheaf at harvest, to which, as embodying the corn-spirit, a 
peculiar significance is attached. The Swedish, like the Polish, Yule straw has 
sundry virtues; scattered on the ground it will make a barren field productive; 
and it is used to bind trees and make them fruitful.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-61">12-61</A><a name="Nanchor_12-61"></A> Again the peasant at Christmas will sit on a log and 
throw up Yule straws one by one to the roof; as many as lodge in the rafters, so 
many will be the sheaves of rye at harvest.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-62">12-62</A><a name="Nanchor_12-62"></A> </P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN class=smcap>Christmas and New Year Gifts.</SPAN></H3>
<P>We have come across presents of various kinds at the pre-Christmas festivals; 
now that we have reached Christmastide itself we may dwell a little upon the 
festival as the great present-giving season of the year, and try to get at the 
origins of the custom.</P>
<P>The Roman <I>strenae</I> offered to the Emperor or exchanged between private 
citizens at the January Kalends have already <A NAME="page_277"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 277</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_277"></A>been noted. According to tradition they were originally 
merely branches plucked from the grove of the goddess Strenia, and the purpose 
of these may well have been akin to that of the greenery used for decorations, 
viz., to secure contact with a vegetation-spirit. In the time of the Empire, 
however, the <I>strenae</I> were of a more attractive character, &#8220;men gave 
honeyed things, that the year of the recipient might be full of sweetness, lamps 
that it might be full of light, copper and silver and gold that wealth might 
flow in amain.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-63">12-63</A><a name="Nanchor_12-63"></A> Such presents were obviously a kind of charm for the 
New Year, based on the principle that as the beginning was, so would the rest of 
the year be.</P>
<P>With the adoption of the Roman New Year's Day its present-giving customs 
appear to have spread far and wide. In France, where the Latin spirit is still 
strong, January&nbsp;1 is even now the great day for presents, and they are 
actually called <I>&eacute;trennes</I>, a name obviously derived from <I>strenae</I>. 
In Paris boxes of sweets are then given by bachelors to friends who have 
entertained them at their houses during the year&#65279;&#8212;a survival perhaps of the 
&#8220;honeyed things&#8221; given in Roman times.</P>
<P>In many countries, however, present-giving is attached to the ecclesiastical 
festival of Christmas. This is doubtless largely due to attraction from the 
Roman New Year's Day to the feast hallowed by the Church, but readers of the 
foregoing pages will have seen that Christmas has also drawn to itself many 
practices of a November festival, and it is probable that German Christmas 
presents, at least, are connected as much with the apples and nuts of St. Martin 
and St. Nicholas&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_107">107</A><a name="FNanchor_107"></A> as with the Roman <I>strenae</I>. It has already 
been pointed out that the German St. Nicholas as present-giver appears to be a 
duplicate of St. Martin, and that St. Nicholas himself has often wandered from 
his own day to Christmas, or has been replaced by the Christ Child. We have also 
noted the rod associated with the two saints, and seen reason for thinking that 
its original purpose was not disciplinary but health-giving.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_278"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 278</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_278"></A>It is interesting to find that while, if we may trust 
tradition, the Roman <I>strenae</I> were originally twigs, Christmas gifts in 
sixteenth-century Germany showed a connection with the twigs or rods of St. 
Martin and St. Nicholas. The presents were tied together in a bundle, and a twig 
was added to them.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-65">12-65</A><a name="Nanchor_12-65"></A> This was regarded by the pedagogic mind of the 
period not as a lucky twig but as a rod in the sinister sense. In some 
Protestant sermons of the latter half of the century there are curious detailed 
references to Christmas presents. These are supposed to be brought to children 
by the Saviour Himself, strangely called the <I>Haus-Christ</I>. Among the gifts 
mentioned as contained in the &#8220;Christ-bundles&#8221; are pleasant things like money, 
sugar-plums, cakes, apples, nuts, dolls; useful things like clothes; and also 
things &#8220;that belong to teaching, obedience, chastisement, and discipline, as 
A.B.C. tablets, Bibles and handsome books, writing materials, paper, &amp;c., 
<I>and the</I> &#145;<I>Christ-rod</I>.&#146;&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-66">12-66</A><a name="Nanchor_12-66"></A> </P>
<P>A common gift to German children at Christmas or the New Year was an apple 
with a coin in it; the coin may conceivably be a Roman survival,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-67">12-67</A><a name="Nanchor_12-67"></A> while the apple may be connected with those brought 
by St. Nicholas.</P>
<P>The Christ Child is still supposed to bring presents in Germany; in France, 
too, it is sometimes <I>le petit J&eacute;sus</I> who bears the welcome gifts.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-68">12-68</A><a name="Nanchor_12-68"></A> In Italy we shall find that the great time for 
children's presents is Epiphany Eve, when the Befana comes, though in the 
northern provinces Santa Lucia is sometimes a gift-bringer.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-69">12-69</A><a name="Nanchor_12-69"></A> In Sicily the days for gifts and the supposed 
bringers vary; sometimes, as we have already seen, it is the dead who bring 
them, on All Souls&#146; Eve; sometimes it is <I>la Vecchia di Natali</I>&#65279;&#8212;the 
Christmas old woman&#65279;&#8212;who comes with them on Christmas Eve; sometimes they are 
brought by the old woman Strina&#65279;&#8212;note the derivation from <I>strenae</I>&#65279;&#8212;at the 
New Year; sometimes by the Befana at the Epiphany.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-70">12-70</A><a name="Nanchor_12-70"></A> </P>
<P>A curious mode of giving presents on Christmas Eve belongs particularly to 
Sweden, though it is also found&#65279;&#8212;perhaps borrowed&#65279;&#8212;in Mecklenburg, Pomerania, 
and other parts of Germany. The so-called <I>Julklapp</I> is a gift wrapped up 
in innumerable coverings. The person who brings it raps noisily at <A NAME="page_279"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 279</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_279"></A>the door, and throws or pushes the <I>Julklapp</I> into the 
room. It is essential that he should arrive quite unexpectedly, and come and go 
like lightning without revealing his identity. Great efforts are made to conceal 
the gift so that the recipient after much trouble in undoing the covering may 
have to search and search again to find it. Sometimes in Sweden a thin gold ring 
is hidden away in a great heavy box, or a little gold heart is put in a 
Christmas cake. Occasionally a man contrives to hide in the <I>Julklapp</I> and 
thus offer himself as a Christmas present to the lady whom he loves. The gift is 
often accompanied by some satirical rhyme, or takes a form intended to tease the 
recipient.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-71">12-71</A><a name="Nanchor_12-71"></A> </P>
<P>Another custom, sometimes found in &#8220;better-class&#8221; Swedish households, is for 
the Christmas presents to be given by two masked figures, an old man and an old 
woman. The old man holds a bell in his hand and rings it, the old woman carries 
a basket full of sealed packets, which she delivers to the addressees.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-72">12-72</A><a name="Nanchor_12-72"></A> </P>
<P>There is nothing specially interesting in modern English modes of 
present-giving. We may, however, perhaps see in the custom of Christmas boxes, 
inexorably demanded and not always willingly bestowed, a degeneration of what 
was once friendly entertainment given in return for the good wishes and the luck 
brought by wassailers. Instances of gifts to calling neighbours have already 
come before our notice at several pre-Christmas festivals, notably All Souls&#146;, 
St. Clement's, and St. Thomas's. As for the name &#8220;Christmas box,&#8221; it would seem 
to have come from the receptacles used for the gifts. According to one account 
apprentices, journeymen, and servants used to carry about earthen boxes with a 
slit in them, and when the time for collecting was over, broke them to obtain 
the contents.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-73">12-73</A><a name="Nanchor_12-73"></A> </P>
<P>The Christmas card, a sort of attenuated present, seems to be of quite modern 
origin. It is apparently a descendant of the &#8220;school pieces&#8221; or &#8220;Christmas 
pieces&#8221; popular in England in the first half of the nineteenth century&#65279;&#8212;sheets 
of writing-paper with designs in pen and ink or copper-plate headings. The first 
Christmas card proper appears to have been issued in 1846, but it was not till 
about 1862 that the custom of card-sending obtained any foothold.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-74">12-74</A><a name="Nanchor_12-74"></A> </P>
