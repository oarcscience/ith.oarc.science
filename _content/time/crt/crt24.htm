&#8220;Christianity,&#8221; as here used, will stand for the system of orthodoxy which had 
been fixed in its main outlines when the festival of Christmas took its rise. 
The relation of the orthodox creed to historical fact need not concern us here, 
nor need we for the purposes of this study attempt to distinguish between the 
Christianity of Jesus and ecclesiastical accretions around his 
teaching.</P></DIV>

Whether the Nativity had previously been celebrated at Rome on January&nbsp;6 is 
a matter of controversy; the affirmative view was maintained by Usener in his 
monograph on Christmas,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-6">1-6</A><a name="Nanchor_1-6"></A> the negative by Monsignor Duchesne.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-7">1-7</A><a name="Nanchor_1-7"></A> A very minute, cautious, and balanced study of both 
arguments is to be found in Professor Kirsopp Lake's article on Christmas in 
Hastings's &#8220;Encyclop&aelig;dia of Religion and Ethics,&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-8">1-8</A><a name="Nanchor_1-8"></A> and a short article was contributed by the same writer 
to <I>The Guardian</I>, December&nbsp;29, 1911. Professor Lake, on the whole, 
inclines to Usener's view. The early history of the festival is also treated by 
Father Cyril Martindale in &#8220;The Catholic Encyclop&aelig;dia&#8221; (article 
&#8220;Christmas&#8221;).</P></DIV>

The eastern father, Epiphanius (fourth century), gives a strange account of a 
heathen, or perhaps in reality a Gnostic, rite held at Alexandria on the night 
of January&nbsp;5-6. In the temple of Kore&#65279;&#8212;the Maiden&#65279;&#8212;he tells us, worshippers 
spent the night in singing and flute-playing, and at cock-crow brought up from a 
subterranean sanctuary a wooden image seated naked on a litter. It had the sign 
of the cross upon it in gold in five places&#65279;&#8212;the forehead, the hands, and the 
knees. This image was carried seven times round the central hall of the temple 
with flute-playing, drumming, and hymns, and then taken back to the underground 
chamber. In explanation of these strange actions it was said: &#8220;To-day, at this 
hour, hath Kore (the Maiden) borne the &AElig;on.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-15">1-15</A><a name="Nanchor_1-15"></A> Can there be a connection between this festival and 
the Eleusinian mysteries? In the latter there was a nocturnal celebration with 
many lights burning, and the cry went forth, &#8220;Holy Brimo (the Maiden) hath borne 
a sacred child, Brimos.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-16">1-16</A><a name="Nanchor_1-16"></A> The details given by Miss Harrison in her 
&#8220;Prolegomena&#8221; of the worship of the child Dionysus&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-17">1-17</A><a name="Nanchor_1-17"></A> are of extraordinary interest, and a minute 
comparison of this cult with that of the Christ Child might lead to remarkable 
results.</P></DIV>

Mithraism resembled Christianity in its monotheistic tendencies, its sacraments, 
its comparatively high morality, its doctrine of an Intercessor and Redeemer, 
and its vivid belief in a future life and judgment to come. Moreover Sunday was 
its holy-day dedicated to the Sun.</P></DIV>

This is the explanation adopted by most scholars (cf. Chambers, &#8220;M. S.,&#8221; i., 
241-2). Duchesne suggests as an explanation of the choice of December&nbsp;25 
the fact that a tradition fixed the Passion of Christ on March&nbsp;25. The same 
date, he thinks, would have been assigned to His Conception in order to make the 
years of His life complete, and the Birth would come naturally nine months after 
the Conception. He, however, &#8220;would not venture to say, in regard to the 25th of 
December, that the coincidence of the <I>Sol novus</I> exercised no direct or 
indirect influence on the ecclesiastical decision arrived at in regard to the 
matter.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_1-25">1-25</A><a name="Nanchor_1-25"></A> Professor Lake also, in his article in Hastings's 
&#8220;Encyclop&aelig;dia,&#8221; seeks to account for the selection of December&nbsp;25 without 
any deliberate competition with the <I>Natalis Invicti</I>. He points out that 
the Birth of Christ was fixed at the vernal equinox by certain early 
chronologists, on the strength of an elaborate and fantastic calculation based 
on Scriptural data, and connecting the Incarnation with the Creation, and that 
when the Incarnation came to be viewed as beginning at the Conception instead of 
the Birth, the latter would naturally be placed nine months later.</P></DIV>

Cf. chap. xviii. of Dr. Yrj&ouml; Hirn's &#8220;The Sacred Shrine&#8221; (London, 1912). Dr. Hirn 
finds a solitary anticipation of the Franciscan treatment of the Nativity in the 
Christmas hymns of the fourth-century eastern poet, Ephraem Syrus.</P></DIV>

round the little baby Prince of the Elect who lies naked among the prickly

were not at all a divine man.&#8221;</P>

&#8220;When Jesus Christ was born, then was it cold; in a little crib He was laid.

&#8220;Dearest mother, take care of the Child; it is freezing hard, wrap Him up 
quickly. And you, old father, tuck the little one up, or the cold and the wind 
will give Him no rest. Now we must take our leave, O divine Child, remember us, 
pardon our sins. We are heartily glad that Thou art come; no one else could have 
helped us.&#8221;</P></DIV>

&#8220;The Child is laid in the crib, so hearty and so rare! My little Hans would be 
nothing by His side, were he finer than he is. Coal-black as cherries are His 
eyes, the rest of Him is white as chalk. His pretty hands are right tender and 
delicate, I touched Him carefully. Then He gave me a smile and a deep sigh too. 
If you were mine, thought I, you'd grow a merry boy. At home in the kitchen I'd 
comfortably house you; out here in the stable the cold wind comes in at every 
corner.&#8221;</P></DIV>

Richard Rolle, poet, mystic, and wandering preacher, in many ways reminds us of 
Jacopone da Todi. Though he has left no Christmas verses, some lovely words of 
his show how deeply he felt the wonder and pathos of Bethlehem: &#8220;Jhesu es thy 
name. A! A! that wondryrfull name! A! that delittabyll name! This es the name 
that es above all names.... I yede [went] abowte be Covaytyse of riches and I 
fand noghte Jhesu. I satt in companyes of Worldly myrthe and I fand noghte 
Jhesu.... Therefore I turnede by anothire waye, and I rane a-bowte be Poverte, 
and I fande Jhesu pure borne in the worlde, laid in a crybe and lappid in

&#8220;When midnight sounded I leapt from my bed to the floor, and I saw a beautiful 
angel who sang a thousand times sweeter than a nightingale. The watch-dogs of 
the neighbourhood all came up. Never had they seen such a sight, and they 
suddenly began to bark. The shepherds under the straw were sleeping like logs: 
when they heard the sound of the barking they thought it was the wolves. They 
were reasonable folk; they came without waiting to be asked. They found in a 
little stable the Light, even the Truth.&#8221;</P></DIV>

&#8220;Within a poor manger and covered with hay lies Jesus of Nazareth. In the hay 
lies stretched the Eternal Son of God; to deliver from hell man whom He had 
created, and to kill sin, our Jesus of Nazareth is content with the hay. He 
rests between two animals who warm Him from the cold, He who remedies our ills 
with His great power; His kingdom and seigniory are the world and the calm 
heaven, and now He sleeps in the hay. He counts it good to bear the cold and 
fare thus, having no robe to protect or cover Him, and to give us life He 
suffered cold in the hay, our Jesus of Nazareth.&#8221;</P></DIV>

from the porch the flame issues; it is a star of heaven which has fallen into

The first mention of a season corresponding to Advent is at the Council of 
Tours, about 567, when a fast for monks in December is vaguely indicated. At the 
Council of M&acirc;con (581) it is enjoined that from Martinmas the second, fourth, 
and sixth days of the week should be fasting days; and at the close of the sixth 
century Rome, under Gregory the Great, adopted the rule of the four Sundays in 
Advent. In the next century it became prevalent in the West. In the Greek 
Church, forty days of fasting are observed before Christmas; this custom appears 
to have been established in the thirteenth century. In the Roman Church the 
practice as to fasting varies: in the British Isles Wednesday and Friday are 
observed, but in some countries no distinction is made between Advent and 
ordinary weeks of the year.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_4-2">4-2</A><a name="Nanchor_4-2"></A> </P></DIV>

Besides the Nativity plays in the four great cycles there exists a &#8220;Shearmen and 
Tailors&#146; Play&#8221; which undoubtedly belongs to Coventry, unlike the &#8220;Ludus 
Coventriae,&#8221; whose connection with that town is, to say the least, highly 
doubtful. It opens with a prologue by the prophet Isaiah, and in a small space 
presents the events connected with the Incarnation from the Annunciation to the 
Murder of the Innocents. The Nativity and shepherd scenes have less character 
and interest than those in the great cycles, and need not be dealt with here.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_5-18">5-18</A><a name="Nanchor_5-18"></A> </P></DIV>

Though the ox and ass are not mentioned by St. Luke, it is an easy transition to 
them from the idea of the manger. Early Christian writers found a Scriptural 
sanction for them in two passages in the prophets: Isaiah i. 3, &#8220;The ox knoweth 
his owner and the ass his master's crib,&#8221; and Habakkuk iii. 2 (a 
mistranslation), &#8220;In the midst of two beasts shall Thou be known.&#8221;</P></DIV>

Among the Scandinavians, who were late in their conversion, a pre-Christian Yule

It is only right to mention here Professor G. Bilfinger's monograph &#8220;Das 
germanische Julfest&#8221; (Stuttgart, 1901), where it is maintained that the only 
festivals from which the Christmas customs of the Teutonic peoples have sprung 
are the January Kalends of the Roman Empire and the Christian feast of the 
Nativity. Bilfinger holds that there is no evidence either of a November 
beginning-of-winter festival or of an ancient Teutonic midwinter feast. 
Bilfinger's is the most systematic of existing treatises on Christmas origins, 
but the considerations brought forward in Tille's &#8220;Yule and Christmas&#8221; in favour 
of the November festival are not lightly to be set aside, and while recognizing 
that its celebration must be regarded rather as a probable hypothesis than an 
established fact, I shall here follow in general the suggestions of Tille and 
try to show the contributions of this northern New Year feast to Christmas 
customs.</P></DIV>

Accounts of such maskings are to be found in innumerable books of travel. In 
<I>Folk-Lore</I>, June&nbsp;30, 1911, Professor Edward Westermarck gives a 
particularly full and interesting description of Moroccan customs of this sort. 
He describes at length various masquerades in the skins and heads of beasts, 
accompanied often by the dressing-up of men as women and by gross 
obscenities.</P></DIV>

Another suggested explanation connects the change of clothes with rites of 
initiation at the passage from boyhood to manhood. &#8220;Manhood, among primitive 
peoples, seems to be envisaged as ceasing to be a woman.... Man is born of 
woman, reared of woman. When he passes to manhood, he ceases to be a 
woman-thing, and begins to exercise functions other and alien. That moment is 
one naturally of extreme peril; he at once emphasizes it and disguises it. He 
wears woman's clothes.&#8221; From initiation rites, according to this theory, the 
custom spread to other occasions when it was desirable to &#8220;change the 
luck.&#8221;</P></DIV>

According to Sir John Rhys, in the Isle of Man <I>Hollantide</I> 
(November&nbsp;1, Old Style, therefore November&nbsp;12) is still to-day the 
beginning of a new year. But the ordinary calendar is gaining ground, and some 
of the associations of the old New Year's Day are being transferred to 
January&nbsp;1, the Roman date. &#8220;In Wales this must have been decidedly helped 
by the influence of Roman rule and Roman ideas; but even there the adjuncts of 
the Winter Calends have never been wholly transferred to the Calends of 
January.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_8-4">8-4</A><a name="Nanchor_8-4"></A> </P></DIV>

The prominence of &#8220;Eves&#8221; in festival customs is a point specially to be noticed; 
it is often to them rather than to the actual feast days that old practices 
cling. This is perhaps connected with the ancient Celtic and Teutonic habit of 
reckoning by nights instead of days&#65279;&#8212;a trace of this is left in our word 
&#8220;fortnight&#8221;&#65279;&#8212;but it must be remembered that the Church encouraged the same 
tendency by her solemn services on the Eves of festivals, and that the Jewish 
Sabbath begins on Friday evening.</P></DIV>

Sometimes Christmas is reckoned as one of the Twelve Days, sometimes not. In the 
former case, of course, the Epiphany is the thirteenth day. In England we call 
the Epiphany Twelfth Day, in Germany it is generally called Thirteenth; in 
Belgium and Holland it is Thirteenth; in Sweden it varies, but is usually 
Thirteenth. Sometimes then the Twelve Days are spoken of, sometimes the 
Thirteen. &#8220;The Twelve Nights,&#8221; in accordance with the old Teutonic mode of 
reckoning by nights, is a natural and correct term.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_10-39">10-39</A><a name="Nanchor_10-39"></A> </P></DIV>

Those who wish to pursue further the study of the <I>Kallikantzaroi</I> should 
read the elaborate and fascinating, if not altogether convincing, theories of 
Mr. J. C. Lawson in his &#8220;Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion.&#8221; He 
distinguishes two classes of <I>Kallikantzaroi</I>, one of which he identifies 
with ordinary werewolves, while the other is the type of hairy, clawed demons 
above described. He sets forth a most ingenious hypothesis connecting them with 
the Centaurs.</P></DIV>

It is to be borne in mind that the oak was a sacred tree among the heathen 
Slavs; it was connected with the thunder-god Perun, the counterpart of Jupiter, 
and a fire of oak burned night and day in his honour. The neighbours of the 
Slavs, the Lithuanians, had the same god, whom they called Perkunas; they too 
kept up a perpetual oak-fire in his honour, and in time of drought they used to 
pour beer on the flames, praying to Perkunas to send showers.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_11-10">11-10</A><a name="Nanchor_11-10"></A> The libations of wine on the Yule log may

At Wormesley in Herefordshire there is a Holy Thorn which is still believed to 
blossom exactly at twelve o'clock on Twelfth Night. &#8220;The blossoms are thought to 
open at midnight, and drop off about an hour afterwards. A piece of thorn 
gathered at this hour brings luck, if kept for the rest of the year.&#8221; As 
recently as 1908 about forty people went to see the thorn blossom at this time 
(see E. M. Leather, &#8220;The Folk-Lore of Herefordshire&#8221; [London, 1912], 
17).</P></DIV>

In Welsh it has also the name of &#8220;the tree of pure gold,&#8221; a rather surprising 
title for a plant with green leaves and white berries. Dr. Frazer has sought to 
explain this name by the theory that in a roundabout way the sun's golden fire 
was believed to be an emanation from the mistletoe, in which the life of the 
oak, whence fire was kindled, was held to reside.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_12-47">12-47</A><a name="Nanchor_12-47"></A> </P></DIV>

Dancing is, as everyone knows, a common and indeed a central feature of

The custom of &#8220;burning the bush,&#8221; still surviving here and there in 
Herefordshire, shows a certain resemblance to this. The &#8220;bush,&#8221; a globe made of 
hawthorn, hangs throughout the year in the farmhouse kitchen, with the 
mistletoe. Early on New Year's Day it &#8220;is carried to the earliest sown wheat 
field, where a large fire is lighted, of straw and bushes, in which it is burnt. 
While it is burning, a new one is made; in making it, the ends of the branches 
are scorched in the fire.&#8221; Burning straw is carried over twelve ridges of the 
field, and then follow cider-drinking and cheering. (See Leather, &#8220;Folk-Lore of 
Herefordshire,&#8221; 91&nbsp;f.)</P></DIV></DIV>
