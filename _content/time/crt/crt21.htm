<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><a name="CONCLUSION"></A>CONCLUSION</H2>
<P>The reader who has had patience to persevere will by now have gained some 
idea of the manner in which Christmas is, and has been, kept throughout Europe. 
We have traced the evolution of the festival, seen it take its rise soon after 
the victory of the Catholic doctrine of Christ's person at Nicea, and spread 
from Rome to every quarter of the Empire, not as a folk-festival but as an 
ecclesiastical holy-day. We have seen the Church condemn with horror the relics 
of pagan feasts which clung round the same season of the year; then, as time 
went on, we have found the two elements, pagan and Christian, mingling in some 
degree, the pagan losing most of its serious meaning, and continuing mainly as 
ritual performed for the sake of use and wont or as a jovial tradition, the 
Christian becoming humanized, the skeleton of dogma clothed with warm flesh and 
blood.</P>
<P>We have considered, as represented in poetry and liturgy, the strictly 
ecclesiastical festival, the commemoration of the Nativity as the beginning of 
man's redemption. We have seen how in the carols, the cult of the 
<I>presepio</I>, and the religious drama, the Birth of the King of Glory in the 
stable at midwinter has presented itself in concrete form to the popular mind, 
calling up a host of human emotions, a crowd of quaint and beautiful fancies. 
Lastly we have noted the survival, in the most varied degrees of transformation, 
of things which are alien to Christianity and in some cases seem to go back to 
very primitive stages of thought and feeling. An antique reverence for the 
plant-world may lie, as we have seen, beneath the familiar institution of the 
Christmas-tree, some sort of animal-worship may be at the bottom of the <A NAME="page_358"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 358</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_358"></A>beast-masks common at winter festivals, survivals of 
sacrifice may linger in Christmas feasting, and in the family gatherings round 
the hearth may be preserved a dim memory of ancient domestic rites.</P>
<P>Christmas, indeed, regarded in all its aspects, is a microcosm of European 
religion. It reflects almost every phase of thought and feeling from crude magic 
and superstition to the speculative mysticism of Eckhart, from mere delight in 
physical indulgence to the exquisite spirituality and tenderness of St. Francis. 
Ascetic and <I>bon-vivant</I>, mystic and materialist, learned and simple, noble 
and peasant, all have found something in it of which to lay hold. It is a river 
into which have flowed tributaries from every side, from Oriental religion, from 
Greek and Roman civilization, from Celtic, Teutonic, Slav, and probably 
pre-Aryan, society, mingling their waters so that it is often hard to discover 
the far-away springs.</P>
<P>We have seen how the Reformation broke up the great mediaeval synthesis of 
paganism and Christianity, how the extremer forms of Protestantism aimed at 
completely destroying Christmas, and how the general tendency of modern 
civilization, with its scientific spirit, its popular education, its railways, 
its concentration of the people in great cities, has been to root out 
traditional beliefs and customs both Christian and pagan, so that if we would 
seek for relics of the old things we must go to the regions of Europe that are 
least industrially and intellectually &#8220;advanced.&#8221; Yet amongst the most sceptical 
and &#8220;enlightened&#8221; of moderns there is generally a large residuum of tradition. 
&#8220;Emotionally,&#8221; it has been said, &#8220;we are hundreds of thousands of years old; 
rationally we are embryos&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_18-1">18-1</A><a name="Nanchor_18-1"></A> ; and many people who deem themselves &#8220;emancipated&#8221; 
are willing for once in the year to plunge into the stream of tradition, merge 
themselves in inherited social custom, and give way to sentiments and 
impressions which in their more reflective moments they spurn. Most men are 
ready at Christmas to put themselves into an instinctive rather than a rational 
attitude, to drink of the springs of wonder, and return in some degree to 
earlier, less intellectual stages of human development&#65279;&#8212;to become in fact 
children again.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_359"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 359</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_359"></A>Many elements enter into the modern Christmas. There is the 
delight of its warmth and brightness and comfort against the bleak midwinter. A 
peculiar charm of the northern Christmas lies in the thought of the cold barred 
out, the home made a warm, gay place in contrast with the cheerless world 
outside. There is the physical pleasure of &#8220;good cheer,&#8221; of plentiful eating and 
drinking, joined to, and partly resulting in, a sense of goodwill and expansive 
kindliness towards the world at large, a temporary feeling of the brotherhood of 
man, a desire that the poor may for once in the year &#8220;have a good time.&#8221; Here 
perhaps we may trace the influence of the <I>Saturnalia</I>, with its dreams of 
the age of gold, its exaltation of them of low degree. Mixed with a little 
sentimental Christianity this is the Christmas of Dickens&#65279;&#8212;the Christmas which 
he largely helped to perpetuate in England.</P>
<P>Each nation, naturally, has fashioned its own Christmas. The English have 
made it a season of solid material comfort, of good-fellowship and &#8220;charity,&#8221; 
with a slight flavour of soothing religion. The modern French, sceptical and 
pagan, make little of Christmas, and concentrate upon the secular celebration of 
the <I>jour de l'an</I>. For the Scandinavians Christmas is above all a time of 
sport, recreation, good living, and social gaiety in the midst of a season when 
little outdoor work can be done and night almost swallows up day. The Germans, 
sentimental and childlike, have produced a Christmas that is a very Paradise for 
children and at which the old delight to play at being young again around the 
Tree. For the Italians Christmas is centred upon the cult of the <I>Bambino</I>, 
so fitted to their dramatic instincts, their love of display, their strong 
parental affection. (How much of the sentiment that surrounds the 
<I>presepio</I> is, though religiously heightened, akin to the delight of a 
child in its doll!) If the Germans may be called the good, industrious, 
sentimental children of Europe, making the most of simple things, the Italians 
are the lively, passionate, impulsive children, loving gay clothes and finery; 
and the contrast shows in their keeping of Christmas.</P>
<P>The modern Christmas is above all things a children's feast, and the elders 
who join in it put themselves upon their children's <A NAME="page_360"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 360</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_360"></A>level. We have noted how ritual acts, once performed with 
serious purpose, tend to become games for youngsters, and have seen many an 
example of this process in the sports and mummeries kept up by the elder folk 
for the benefit of the children. We have seen too how the radiant figure of the 
Christ Child has become a gift-bringer for the little ones. At no time in the 
world's history has so much been made of children as to-day, and because 
Christmas is their feast its lustre continues unabated in an age upon which 
dogmatic Christianity has largely lost its hold, which laughs at the pagan 
superstitions of its forefathers. Christmas is the feast of beginnings, of 
instinctive, happy childhood; the Christian idea of the Immortal Babe renewing 
weary, stained humanity, blends with the thought of the New Year, with its hope 
and promise, laid in the cradle of Time.</P>
