  <P>Horse Customs of St. Stephen's Day&#65279;&#8212;The Swedish St. Stephen&#65279;&#8212;St. John's 
  Wine&#65279;&#8212;Childermas and its Beatings.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The three saints&#146; days immediately following Christmas&#65279;&#8212;St. Stephen's 
(December&nbsp;26), St. John the Evangelist's (December&nbsp;27), and the Holy 
Innocents&#146; (December&nbsp;28)&#65279;&#8212;have still various folk-customs associated with 
them, in some cases purely secular, in others hallowed by the Church.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN class=smcap>St. Stephen's Day.</SPAN></H3>
<P>In Tyrolese churches early in the morning of St. Stephen's Day there takes 
place a consecration of water and of salt brought by the people. The water is 
used by the peasants to sprinkle food, barns, and fields in order to avert the 
influence of witches and evil spirits, and bread soaked in it is given to the 
cattle when they are driven out to pasture on Whit Monday. The salt, too, is 
given to the beasts, and the peasants themselves partake of it before any 
important journey like a pilgrimage. Moreover when a storm is threatening some 
is thrown into the fire as a protection against hail.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-1">15-1</A><a name="Nanchor_15-1"></A> </P>
<P>The most striking thing about St. Stephen's Day, however, is its connection 
with horses. St. Stephen is their patron; in England in former times they were 
bled on his festival in the belief that it would benefit them,&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-2">15-2</A><a name="Nanchor_15-2"></A> and the custom is still continued in some parts of 
Austria.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-3">15-3</A><a name="Nanchor_15-3"></A> In Tyrol it is the custom not only to <A NAME="page_312"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 312</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_312"></A>bleed horses on St. Stephen's Day, but also to give them 
consecrated salt and bread or oats and barley.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-4">15-4</A><a name="Nanchor_15-4"></A> </P>
<P>In some of the Carinthian valleys where horse-breeding is specially carried 
on, the young men ride into the village on their unsaddled steeds, and a race is 
run four or five times round the church, while the priest blesses the animals, 
sprinkling them with holy water and exorcizing them.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-5">15-5</A><a name="Nanchor_15-5"></A> </P>
<P>Similar customs are or were found in various parts of Germany. In Munich, 
formerly, during the services on St. Stephen's Day more than two hundred men on 
horseback used to ride three times round the interior of a church. The horses 
were decorated with many-coloured ribbons, and the practice was not abolished 
till 1876.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-6">15-6</A><a name="Nanchor_15-6"></A> At Backnang in Swabia horses were ridden out, as fast 
as possible, to protect them from the influence of witches, and in the Hohenlohe 
region men-servants were permitted by their masters to ride in companies to 
neighbouring places, where much drinking went on.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-7">15-7</A><a name="Nanchor_15-7"></A> In Holstein the lads on Stephen's Eve used to visit 
their neighbours in a company, groom the horses, and ride about in the 
farmyards, making a great noise until the people woke up and treated them to 
beer and spirits.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-8">15-8</A><a name="Nanchor_15-8"></A> At the village of Wallsb&uuml;ll near Flensburg the peasant 
youths in the early morning held a race, and the winner was called Steffen and 
entertained at the inn. At Vi&ouml;l near Bredstadt the child who got up last on 
December&nbsp;26 received the name of Steffen and had to ride to a neighbour's 
house on a hay-fork. In other German districts the festival was called &#8220;the 
great horse-day,&#8221; consecrated food was given to the animals, they were driven 
round and round the fields until they sweated violently, and at last were ridden 
to the blacksmith's and bled, to keep them healthy through the year. The blood 
was preserved as a remedy for various illnesses.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-9">15-9</A><a name="Nanchor_15-9"></A> </P>
<P>It is, however, in Sweden that the &#8220;horsy&#8221; aspect of the festival is most 
obvious.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-10">15-10</A><a name="Nanchor_15-10"></A> Formerly there was a custom, at one o'clock on St. 
Stephen's morning, for horses to be ridden to water that flowed northward; they 
would then drink &#8220;the cream of the water&#8221; and flourish during the year. There 
was a violent race to the water, and the servant who got there first was 
rewarded by a drink of something stronger. Again, early that morning one <A NAME="page_313"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 313</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_313"></A>peasant would clean out another's stable, often at some 
distance from his home, feed, water, and rub down the horses, and then be 
entertained to breakfast. In olden times after service on St. Stephen's Day 
there was a race home on horseback, and it was supposed that he who arrived 
first would be the first to get his harvest in. But the most remarkable custom 
is the early morning jaunt of the so-called &#8220;Stephen's men,&#8221; companies of 
peasant youths, who long before daybreak ride in a kind of race from village to 
village and awaken the inhabitants with a folk-song called <I>Staffansvisa</I>, 
expecting to be treated to ale or spirits in return.</P>
<P>The cavalcade is supposed to represent St. Stephen and his followers, yet the 
saint is not, as might be expected, the first martyr of the New Testament, but a 
dauntless missionary who, according to old legends, was one of the first 
preachers of the Gospel in Sweden, and was murdered by the heathen in a dark 
forest. A special trait, his love of horses, connects him with the customs just 
described. He had, the legends tell, five steeds: two red, two white, one 
dappled; when one was weary he mounted another, making every week a great round 
to preach the Word. After his death his body was fastened to the back of an 
unbroken colt, which halted not till it came near Norrala, his home. There he 
was buried, and a church built over his grave became a place of pilgrimage to 
which sick animals, especially horses, were brought for healing.</P>
<P>Mannhardt and Feilberg hold that this Swedish St. Stephen is not a historical 
personage but a mythical figure, like many other saints, and that his legend, so 
bound up with horses, was an attempt to account for the folk-customs practised 
on the day dedicated to St. Stephen the first martyr. It is interesting to note 
that legendary tradition has played about a good deal with the New Testament 
Stephen; for instance an old English carol makes him a servant in King Herod's 
hall at the time of Christ's birth:&#65279;&#8212;</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i15>&#8220;Stephen out of kitchen came,</SPAN><BR><SPAN  class=i4>With boar&euml;s head on hand,</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i2>He saw a star was 
fair and bright</SPAN><BR><SPAN class=i4>Over Bethlehem 
stand.&#8221;</SPAN><BR></DIV></DIV>
<P><A NAME="page_314"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 314</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_314"></A>Thereupon he forsook King Herod for the Child Jesus, and 
was stoned to death.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-11">15-11</A><a name="Nanchor_15-11"></A> </P>
<P>To return, however, to the horse customs of the day after Christmas, it is 
pretty plain that they are of non-Christian origin. Mannhardt has suggested that 
the race which is their most prominent feature once formed the prelude to a 
ceremony of lustration of houses and fields with a sacred tree. Somewhat similar 
&#8220;ridings&#8221; are found in various parts of Europe in spring, and are connected with 
a procession that appears to be an ecclesiastical adaptation of a pre-Christian 
lustration-rite.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-12">15-12</A><a name="Nanchor_15-12"></A> The great name of Mannhardt lends weight to this 
theory, but it seems a somewhat roundabout way of accounting for the facts. 
Perhaps an explanation of the &#8220;horsiness&#8221; of the day might be sought in some 
pre-Christian sacrifice of steeds.</P>
<P class=thoughtbreak>We have already noted that St. Stephen's Day is often the 
date for the &#8220;hunting of the wren&#8221; in the British Isles; it was also in England 
generally devoted to hunting and shooting, it being held that the game laws were 
not in force on that day.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-13">15-13</A><a name="Nanchor_15-13"></A> This may be only an instance of Christmas licence, 
but it is just possible that there is here a survival of some tradition of 
sacrificial slaughter.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN class=smcap>St. John's Day.</SPAN></H3>
<P>An ecclesiastical adaptation of a pagan practice may be seen in the 
<I>Johannissegen</I> customary on St. John's Day in many parts of Catholic 
Germany and Austria. A quantity of wine is brought to church to be blessed by 
the priest after Mass, and is taken away by the people to be drunk at home. 
There are many popular beliefs about the magical powers of this wine, beliefs 
which can be traced back through at least four centuries. In Tyrol and Bavaria 
it is supposed to protect its drinker from being struck by lightning, in the 
Rhenish Palatinate it is drunk in order that the other wine a man possesses may 
be kept from injury, or that next year's harvest may be good. In Nassau, 
Carinthia, and other regions some is poured into the wine-casks to preserve the 
precious drink from harm, while in Bavaria some is kept for use as medicine in 
sickness. <A NAME="page_315"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 315</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_315"></A>In Syria St. John's wine is said to keep the body sound and 
healthy, and on his day even babes in the cradle are made to join in the family 
drinking.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-14">15-14</A><a name="Nanchor_15-14"></A> </P>
<P>It appears that in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there was a great 
drinking on St. John's Day of ordinary, as well as consecrated, wine, often to 
excess, and scholars of that time seriously believed that <I>Weihnacht</I>, the 
German name for Christmas, should properly be spelt <I>Weinnacht</I>.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-15">15-15</A><a name="Nanchor_15-15"></A> The <I>Johannissegen</I>, or <I>Johannisminne</I> as 
it was sometimes called, seems, all things considered, to be a survival of an 
old wine sacrifice like the <I>Martinsminne</I>. That it does not owe its origin 
to the legend about the cup of poison drunk by St. John is shown by the fact 
that a similar custom was in old times practised in Germany and Sweden on St. 
Stephen's Day.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-16">15-16</A><a name="Nanchor_15-16"></A> </P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN class=smcap>Holy Innocents&#146; Day.</SPAN></H3>
<P>Holy Innocents&#146; Day or Childermas, whether or not because of Herod's 
massacre, was formerly peculiarly unlucky; it was a day upon which no one, if he 
could possibly avoid it, should begin any piece of work. It is said of that 
superstitious monarch, Louis XI. of France, that he would never do any business 
on that day, and of our own Edward IV. that his coronation was postponed, 
because the date originally fixed was Childermas. In Cornwall no housewife would 
scour or scrub on Childermas, and in Northamptonshire it was considered very 
unlucky to begin any undertaking or even to do washing throughout the year on 
the day of the week on which the feast fell. Childermas was there called Dyzemas 
and a saying ran: &#8220;What is begun on Dyzemas Day will never be finished.&#8221; In 
Ireland it was called &#8220;the cross day of the year,&#8221; and it was said that anything 
then begun must have an unlucky ending.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-17">15-17</A><a name="Nanchor_15-17"></A> </P>
<P>In folk-ritual the day is remarkable for its association with whipping 
customs. The seventeenth-century writer Gregorie mentions a custom of whipping 
up children on Innocents&#146; Day in the morning, and explains its purpose as being 
that the memory of Herod's &#8220;murther might stick the closer; and, in a moderate 
proportion, to act over the crueltie again in kind.&#8221;&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-18">15-18</A><a name="Nanchor_15-18"></A> </P>
<P><A NAME="page_316"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 316</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_316"></A>This explanation will hardly hold water; the many and 
various examples of the practice of whipping at Christmas collected by 
Mannhardt&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-19">15-19</A><a name="Nanchor_15-19"></A> show that it is not confined either to Innocents&#146; 
Day or to children. Moreover it is often regarded not as a cruel infliction, but 
as a service for which return must be made in good things to eat.</P>
<P>In central and southern Germany the custom is called &#8220;peppering&#8221; 
(<I>pfeffern</I>) and also by other names. In the Orlagau the girls on St. 
Stephen's, and the boys on St. John's Day beat their parents and godparents with 
green fir-branches, while the menservants beat their masters with rosemary 
sticks, saying:</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i15>&#8220;Fresh green! Long life!</SPAN><BR><SPAN  class=i2>Give me a bright <I>thaler</I> [or nuts, 
&amp;c.].&#8221;</SPAN><BR></DIV></DIV>
<P>They are entertained with plum-loaf or gingerbreads and brandy. In the Saxon 
Erzgebirge the young fellows whip the women and girls on St. Stephen's Day, if 
possible while they are still in bed, with birch-rods, singing the while:</P>
<DIV class=poem>
<DIV class=stanza><SPAN class=i15>&#8220;Fresh green, fair and fine,</SPAN><BR><SPAN  class=i2>Gingerbread and brandy-wine&#8221;;</SPAN><BR></DIV></DIV>
<P>and on St. John's Day the women pay the men back. At several places in the 
Thuringian Forest children on Innocents&#146; Day beat passers-by with birch-boughs, 
and get in return apples, nuts, and other dainties. Various other German 
examples of the same class of practice are given by Mannhardt.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-20">15-20</A><a name="Nanchor_15-20"></A> </P>
<P>In France children who let themselves be caught in bed on the morning of Holy 
Innocents&#146; came in for a whipping from their parents; while in one province, 
Normandy, the early risers among the young people themselves gave the sluggards 
a beating. The practice even gave birth to a verb&#65279;&#8212;<I>innocenter</I>.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-21">15-21</A><a name="Nanchor_15-21"></A> </P>
<P>There can be little doubt that the Innocents&#146; Day beating is a survival of a 
pre-Christian custom. Similar ritual scourging is found in many countries at 
various seasons of the year, and is by no means confined to Europe.&#65279;&nbsp;<a href="crt22.htm#Note_15-22">15-22</A><a name="Nanchor_15-22"></A> As now practised, it has <A NAME="page_317"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 317</FONT></A>&nbsp;<a name="Page_317"></A>often a harsh appearance, or has become a kind of teasing, 
as when in Bohemia at Easter young men whip girls until they give them 
something. Its original purpose, however, as we have seen in connection with St. 
Martin's rod, seems to have been altogether kindly. The whipping was not meant 
as a punishment or expiation or to harden people to pain, but either to expel 
harmful influences and drive out evil spirits or to convey by contact the 
virtues of some sacred tree.</P>
