# CHAPTER IV.

### THE TRUE FORM AND MAGNITUDE OF THE EARTH.

THE facts and experiments already advanced render it undeniable, that
the surface of all the waters of the earth is horizontal; and that,
however irregular the upper outline of the land itself may be, the whole
mass, land and water together, constitutes an IMMENSE NON-MOVING
CIRCULAR PLANE.

If we travel by land or sea, from any part of the earth in the direction
of any meridian line, and towards the northern central star called
"Polaris," we come to one and the same place, a region of ice, where the
star which has been our guide is directly above us, or vertical to our
position. This region is really THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH; and recent
observations seem to prove that it is a vast central tidal sea, nearly a
thousand miles in diameter, and surrounded by a great wall or barrier of
ice, eighty to a hundred miles in breadth. If from this central region
we trace the outline of the lands which project or radiate from it, and
the surface of which is above the water, we find that the present form
of the earth or "dry land," as distinguished from the waters of the
"great deep," is an

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

irregular mass of capes, bays, and islands, terminating in great bluffs
or headlands, projecting principally towards the south, or, at least, in
a direction away from the great northern centre.

If now we sail with our backs continually to this central star,
"Polaris," or the centre of the earth's surface, we shall arrive at
another region of ice. Upon whatever meridian we sail, keeping the
northern centre behind us, we are checked in our progress by vast and
lofty cliffs of ice. If we turn to the right or to the left of our
meridian, these icy barriers beset us during the whole of our passage.
Hence, we have found that there is a great ebbing and flowing sea at the
earth's centre; with a boundary wall of ice, nearly a hundred miles in
thickness, and three thousand miles in circumference; that springing or
projecting from this icy wall, irregular masses of land stretch out
towards the south, where a desolate waste of turbulent waters surrounds
the continents, and is itself engirdled by vast belts and packs of ice,
bounded by immense frozen barriers, the lateral depth and extent of
which are utterly unknown.

How far the ice extends; how it terminates; and what exists beyond it,
are questions to which no present human experience can reply. All we at
present know is, that snow and hail, howling winds, and indescribable
storms and hurricanes prevail; and that in every direction "human
ingress is barred by unsealed escarpments of perpetual ice," extending
farther than eye or telescope can penetrate, and becoming lost in gloom
and darkness.

The superficial extent or magnitude of the earth from the northern
centre to the southern circumference, can only be stated approximately.
For this purpose the following evidence will suffice. In laying the
Atlantic Cable from the Great Eastern steamship, in 1866, the distance
from Valencia, on the south-western coast of Ireland, to Trinity Bay in
Newfoundland, was found to be 1665 miles. The. longitude of Valencia is
10° 30´ W.; and of Trinity Bay 53° 30´ W. The difference of longitude
between the two places being 43°, and the whole distance round the earth
being divided into 360°. Hence if 43° are found to be 1665 nautical, or
1942 statute miles, 360° will be 13,939 nautical, or 16,262 statute
miles; then taking the proportion of radius to circumference, we have
2200 nautical, or 2556 statute miles as the actual distance from
Valencia, in Ireland, to the polar centre of the earth's surface.

Another and a very beautiful and accurate way of ascertaining the
earth's circumference is the following:--

<span class="small">The difference of longitude between Heart's Content
Station, Newfoundland, and that at Valencia or, in other words, between
the extreme points of the Atlantic) Cable--has been ascertained</span>

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

<span class="small">by Mr. Gould, coast surveyor to the United States
Government, to be 2 hours, 51 minutes, 56.5 seconds." <span
id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10)</span>

The sun passes over the earth and returns to the same point in 24 hours.
If in 2 hours, 51 minutes, and 56.5 seconds, it passes from the meridian
of the Valencia end of the cable to that of its termination at Heart's
Content, a distance of 1942 statute miles, how far will it travel in 24
hours? On making the calculation the answer is, 16,265 statute miles.
This result is only three miles greater distance than that obtained by
the first process.

Again in the *Boston Post*, for Oct. 30th, 1856, Lieut. Maury gives the
following as the correct distances, in geographical miles, across the
Atlantic by the various routes (circle sailing).

If we take the distance (given in the above table) between Liverpool and
New York as 3360 statute miles, and calculate as in the last case, we
find a nearly similar result, making allowance for the *detour* round
the south or north of Ireland.

<span class="small">"The difference of time between London and New
York</span>

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

<span class="small">which the use of the electric cable makes a matter
of some consequence, has latterly been ascertained afresh. It is 4
hours, 55 minutes, 18.95 seconds." <span
id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11)</span>

The results of these several methods are so nearly alike that the
distance 16,262 statute miles may safely be taken as the approximate
circumference of the earth at the latitude of Valencia.

If the distance from Valencia to the Cape of Good Hope, or to Cape Horn,
had ever been actually measured, *not calculated*, the circumference of
the earth at these points could, of course, be readily ascertained. We
cannot admit as evidence the *calculated* length of a degree of
latitude, because this is an amount connected with the theory of the
earth's rotundity; which has been proved to be false. We must therefore
take known distances between places far south of Valencia, where
latitude and longitude have also been carefully observed. In the
Australian Almanack for 1871, page 126 <span
id="fr_12"></span>[2](#fn_12), the distance from Auckland (New Zealand),
to Sydney, is given as 1315 miles, nautical measure, which is equal to
1534 statute miles. At page 118 of the Australian Almanack for 1859,
Captain Stokes, H.M.S. Acheron, communicates the latitude of Auckland as
36° 50´ 05″, S., and longitude 174° 50´ 40″, E.; latitude of Sydney, 33°
51´ 45″, S., and longitude 151° 16´ 15″, E. The difference in longitude,
or time distance, is 23° 34´ 25″, calculating as in the case of Valencia
to Newfoundland,

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

we find that as 23° 34´ 25″ represents 1534 statute miles, 360° will
give 23,400 statute miles as the circumference of the earth at the
latitude of Sydney, Auckland, and the Cape of Good Hope. Hence the
radius or distance from the centre of the north to the above places is,
in round numbers, 3720 statute miles. Calculating in the same way, we
find that from Sydney to the Cape of Good Hope is fully 8600 statute
miles.

The above calculations receive marked corroboration from the practical
experience of mariners. The author has many times been told by captains
of vessels navigating the southern region, that from Cape Town to Port
Jackson in Australia, the distance is not less than 9000 miles; and from
Port Jackson to Cape Horn, 9500 miles; but as many are not willing to
give credit to such statements, the following quotation will be useful,
and will constitute sufficient evidence of the truth of the foregoing
calculations:--

<span class="small">"The Great Britain steamer has arrived, having made
one of the best voyages homeward that has yet been effected, viz., 86
days; 72 only of which were employed in steaming; and the remaining 14
days being accounted for by detentions. She left Melbourne on January
6th, and arrived in Simon's Bay on February 10th, or 35 days. She then
went round to Cape Town, whence she sailed on the 20th of February; and
was afterwards detained for four days at St. Michael's and Vigo. The
distance she steamed per log was 14,688 miles; which for the 72 days,
gives an average of 204 miles a day." <span
id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13)</span>

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

If we multiply the average rate of sailing by the thirty-five days
occupied in running between Melbourne and St. Simon's Bay (near Cape of
Good Hope), we find that the distance is 7140 nautical miles, From
Melbourne to Sydney is 6 degrees of longitude further east, or about S40
nautical miles. Hence 7140 added to 340 give 7480 nautical miles, equal
to 8726 statute miles; which is 126 miles in excess of the distance
given at [p. 94](#page_94).

The following extract furnishes additional evidence upon this important
point:--

<span class="small">"EXTRAORDINARY VOYAGE.--Every yachtsman (says the
*Dublin Express*), will share in the pride with which, a correspondent
relates a brilliant, and, we believe, unexampled exploit which has just
been performed by a small yacht of only 25 tons, which is not a stranger
to the waters of Dublin Bay. The gallant little craft set out from
Liverpool for the antipodes, and arrived safely in Sydney after a
splendid run, performing the entire distance, 16,000 miles, in 130 days.
Such an achievement affords grounds for reasonable exultation, not more
as a proof of the nautical skill of our amateurs, than of their
adventurous spirit, which quite casts in the shade the most daring feats
of Alpine climbers." <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14)</span>

A s the distance from Melbourne to Cape of Good Hope is 7140 nautical
miles, as shown by the log of the *Great Britain*, and as the whole
distance from Melbourne to Liverpool was 14,688 nautical miles, it
follows that, deducting 7140 from 14,688, that the passage from the Cape
of Good Hope to Liverpool was 7548 nautical miles. If we take this
distance from the 16,000 miles, which the

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

above mentioned yacht sailed to Sydney, we have as the distance between
Cape of Good Hope and Sydney, 8452 nautical, or 9860 statute miles.

In a letter from Adelaide which appeared in the *Leeds Mercury* for
April 20th, 1867, speaking of certain commercial difficulties which had
existed there, the following incidental passage occurs:--

<span class="small">"Just as our harvest was being concluded, the first
news arrived of anticipated dearth of breadstuffs at home. The times.
were so hopelessly dull, money was so scarce, and the operation of
shipping wheat a distance of 14,000 miles so dangerous, that for a long
time the news had no practical effect."</span>

From England to Adelaide is here stated as 14,000 nautical, or 16,333
statute miles; and as the difference of longitude between Adelaide and
Sydney is 23 degrees, equal to 1534 statute miles, we find that from
England to Sydney the distance is 17,867 statute miles. Taking from this
the 7548 nautical, or 8806 statute miles, we have again 9061 statute
miles as the distance between the Cape of Good Hope and Sydney.

From the preceding facts it is evident that the circumference of the
earth, at the distance of the Cape of Good Hope from the polar centre,
is *not less* in round numbers than 23,400 miles. Hence the radius or
distance in a direct line from the polar centre to Cape Town, to Sydney,
to Auckland in New Zealand, and to all the places on the same arc, is
about 3720 statute miles. And as the distance from the polar centre to
Valencia in Ireland is shown to be 2556 statute miles, the direct
distance from Valencia to Cape Town is 1164.

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

statute miles. Should it ever be shown by actual direct measurement to
be more than this distance, then the distance from Cape Town to Sydney
must be more than 8600 statute miles. It is a subject which must be kept
open for rectification. What has already been given in the foregoing
pages may be considered as the approximate *minimum* distances.

Having seen that the diameter of the earth's surface--taking the
distance from Auckland in New Zealand, to Sydney, and thence to the Cape
of Good Hope, as a *datum arc*--is 7440 statute miles; we may inquire
how far it is from any of the above places to the great belt of ice
which surrounds the southern oceans. Although large ice islands and
icebergs are often met with a few degrees beyond Cape Horn, what may be
called the solid immovable ramparts of ice seem to be as far south as 78
degrees. In a paper read by Mr. Locke before the Royal Dublin Society,
on Friday evening, November 19th, 1860, and printed in the Journal of
that Society, a map is given representing Antarctic discoveries, on
which is traced a "proposed exploration route," by Captain Maury,
U.S.N.; and in the third paragraph it is said: "I request attention to
the diagram No. 1, representing an approximate tracing of the supposed
Antarctic continent, and showing the steamer track, about twelve days
from Port Philip, the chief naval station of the Austral seas, to some
available landing point, bight, or ravine, under shadow of the
precipitous coast." The steamer track is given on this map as a dotted
line, curving eastwards from 150 degrees to 180 degrees longitude, and
from Port Philip to 78 degrees

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

south latitude. If we take the chord of such an arc, we shall find that
the direct distance from Port Philip to 78 degrees south would be about
nine days' sail, or ten days from Sydney. No ordinary steamer would sail
in such latitudes more than 150 statute miles a day; hence, ten times
150 would be 1500 miles; which added to the previously ascertained
radius at Sydney, would make the total radius of the earth, from the
northern centre to the farthest known southern circumference, to be 5224
statute miles. Thus from purely practical data, setting all theories
aside, it is ascertained that the diameter of the earth, from the Ross
Mountains, or from the volcanic mountains of which Mount Erebus is the
chief, to the same radius distance on the opposite side of the northern
centre, is more than 10,400 miles; and the circumference, 52,800 statute
miles.
