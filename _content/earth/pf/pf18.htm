<p align="center"><small><i>According to the mast ancient texts, Japan is the centre of the earth</i>.&#151;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">W. E. Griffis</span>.</small></p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">According</span> to the earliest cosmogony of the Japanese, as given in their most ancient book, the Ko-ji-ki,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_156"></A><A HREF="#fn_156"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the creators and first inhabitants of our world were a god and goddess, Izanagi and Izanani by name. These, in the beginning,&#151;we quote from Sir Edward Reed,&#151;"standing on the bridge of heaven, pushed down a spear into the green plain of the sea, and stirred it round and round. When they drew it up the drops which fell from its end consolidated and became an island. The sun-born pair descended on to the island, and planting a spear in the ground, point downwards, built a palace round it, taking that for the central roof-pillar. The spear</p>

<p><A NAME="page_141"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 141</FONT></A></p>  
<p>became <i>the axis of the earth</i>, which had been caused to revolve by the stirring round."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_157"></A><A HREF="#fn_157"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>This island, however, was the Japanese Eden. Here originated the human race. Its name was Onogorojima, "The Island of the Congealed Drop." Its first roof-pillar, as we have seen, was the axis of the earth. Over it was "the pivot of the vault of heaven."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_158"></A><A HREF="#fn_158"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Mr. Reed, who has no theory on the subject to maintain, says, "The island must have been situated at the Pole of the earth."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_159"></A><A HREF="#fn_159"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> In like manner, with no idea of the vast anthropological significance and value of the datum, Mr. Griffis remarks, "The island formed by the congealed drops was once at the North Pole, but has since been taken to its present position in the inland Sea."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_160"></A><A HREF="#fn_160"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Here, then, is the testimony of the most ancient</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Japanese tradition. Nothing could be more unequivocal. Izanagi's divinely precious spear of jade,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_161"></A><A HREF="#fn_161"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> like the transverse jade-tube of the ancient Sh&ucirc; King,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_162"></A><A HREF="#fn_162"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is an imperishable index, not only to the astronomical attainments of prehistoric humanity, but also to humanity's prehistoric abode.</p>  
<p>In Part fifth, chapter fourth, further illustration of the Japanese conception of the origin of their race will be given.</p>

L&eacute;on de Rosny calls it l&#146;un des monuments les plus authentiques de la vieille litt&eacute;rature japonaise, and says, "Nous devons non seulement &agrave; cet ouvrage la connaissance de l&#146;histoire du Nippon ant&eacute;rieure au vii. si&egrave;cle de notre &egrave;re, mais l&#146;expos&eacute; le plus autoris&eacute; de l&#146;antique mythologie sintau&iuml;ste. Il y a m&ecirc;me ce fait remarquable, que les dieux primordiaux du panth&eacute;on japonais, mentionn&eacute;s dans ce livre, ne figurent d&eacute;j&agrave; plus au commencement du <i>Yamato bumi</i>, qui est post&eacute;rieur seulement de quelques ann&eacute;es &agrave; la publication du <i>Ko ji ki</i>. Ces dieux primordiaux paraissent oubli&eacute;s, ou tout au moins n&eacute;glig&eacute;s, dans les ouvrages indig&egrave;nes qui ont paru par la suite." <i>Questions d&#146;Arch&eacute;ologie Japonaise</i>. Paris, 1882: p. 3. An English translation of the Ko-ji-ki, by B. H. Chamberlain, has just appeared in <i>Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan</i>, vol. v.</P>

In the following, extracted from Mr. Griffis, no one has ever before known what to make of "<i>the Pillar of Heaven and Earth</i>," "<i>the Bridge of Heaven</i>," the position of primitive Japan "<i>on the top of the globe</i>," and at the same time at "<i>the centre of the Earth:</i>"&#151;"The first series of children born were the islands of Japan. . . . Japan lies on the top of the globe. . . . At this time heaven and earth were very close to each other, and the goddess Amaterazu being a rare and beautiful child, whose body shone brilliantly, Izanagi sent her up the Pillar that united heaven and earth, and bade her rule over the high plain of heaven. . . . As the earth-gods and evil deities multiplied, confusion and discord reigned, which the sun goddess (Amaterazu), seeing, resolved to correct by sending her grandson Ninigi to earth to rule over it. Accompanied by a great retinue of deities, he descended by means of the floating Bridge of Heaven, on which the divine first pair had stood, to Mount Kirishima. After his descent, heaven and earth, which had already separated to a considerable distance, receded utterly, and further communication ceased. . . . According to the most ancient texts Japan is the centre of the earth."</P>

Professor Legge once examined this passage in my presence, and found unexpected corroboration of the interpretation which identifies "the transverse tube of jade" with the axis of heaven.</P>
