<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In</span> the centre of the Garden of Eden, according to Genesis iii. 3, there was a tree exceptional in position, in character, and in its relations to men. Its fruit was "good for food," it was "pleasant to the eyes," "a tree to be desired."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_421"></A><A HREF="#fn_421"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> At first sight it would not perhaps appear how a study of this tree in the different mythologies of the ancient world could assist us in locating primitive Paradise.

<p>proposed it could not; but if the Garden of Eden was precisely at the North Pole, it is plain that a goodly tree standing in the centre of that Garden would have had a visible and obvious cosmical significance which could by no possibility belong to any other. Its fair stem shooting up as arrow-straight as the body of one of the "giant trees of California," far overtopping, it may be, even such gigantic growths as these, would to any one beneath have seemed the living pillar of the very heavens. Around it would have turned the "stars of God," as if in homage; through its topmost branches the human worshiper would have looked up to that unmoving centre-point where stood the changeless throne of the Creator. How conceivable that that Creator should have reserved for sacred uses this one natural altar-height of the Earth, and that by special command He should have guarded its one particular adornment from desecration! (Gen. ii. 16, 17.) If anywhere in the temple of nature there was to be an altar, it could only be here. That it was here finds a fresh and unexpected confirmation in the singular agreement of many ancient religions and mythologies <i>in associating their Paradise-Tree with the axis of the world, or otherwise, with equal unmistakableness, locating it at the Arctic Pole of the Earth</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_422"></A><A HREF="#fn_422"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>

<p>a tree (the Yggdrasil) is well known to ordinary readers. Its roots are in the lowest hell, its mid-branches inclose or overarch the abode of men, its top reaches the highest heaven of the gods. It was their poetical way of saying that the whole world is an organic unity pervaded by one life. As the abode of the gods was in the north polar sky, the summit of the tree was at that point, its base in the south polar abyss, its trunk coincident with the axis of heaven and earth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_423"></A><A HREF="#fn_423"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> It was, therefore, in position and in nature precisely what an idealizing imagination magnifying the primitive tree of Paradise to a real World-tree would have produced.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_424"></A><A HREF="#fn_424"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>But while most readers are familiar with this Norse myth, few are aware how ancient and universal an idea it represents. This same tree appears in the earliest Akkadian mythology.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_425"></A><A HREF="#fn_425"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> And what is precisely to our purpose, it stood, as we have before seen, at "the Centre" or Pole of the earth, where is "the holy house of the gods."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_426"></A><A HREF="#fn_426"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> It is the same</p>

<p>tree which in ancient Egyptian mythology inclosed the sarcophagus of Osiris, and out of which the king of Byblos caused the roof-pillar of his palace to be taken. But this was only another form of the Tat-pillar, which is the axis of the world.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_427"></A><A HREF="#fn_427"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> In the light of comparative cosmology it is quite impossible to agree with Mr. Renouf in his treatment of the Tree in Egyptian mythology. It is neither "the rain cloud," nor "the light morning cloud," nor "the transparent mist on the horizon." His own citations of texts clearly show that under all its names the Egyptian Tree of Life is a true World-tree, whose trunk is coincident in position and direction</p>

<p>with the axis of the world; a tree in whose sky-filling branches Bennu, the sun-bird, is seated; a tree from whose north polar top the "<i>North-wind</i>" proceeds; a tree which, like the Yggdrasil, yields a celestial rain that is as life-giving as Ardvi-S&ucirc;ra's, and that descends, not merely upon the fields of Lower Egypt, but, like Ardvi-S&ucirc;ra's, to the Underworld itself, refreshing "those who are in <i>Amenti</i>."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_428"></A><A HREF="#fn_428"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> The super-terrestrial portion of the Egyptian's Yggdrasil, therefore,&#151;like that of the Northman's,&#151;stands at the Arctic Pole.</p>  
<p>The Ph&#156;nicians, Syrians, and Assyrians had each their sacred tree in which the universe was symbolized.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_429"></A><A HREF="#fn_429"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> In the lost work of Pherecydes the former is represented as a "winged oak."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_430"></A><A HREF="#fn_430"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Over it was thrown the magnificent veil, or <i>peplos</i>, of Harmonia, on which were represented the all-surrounding Ocean with his rivers, the Earth with its <i>omphalos</i> in the centre, the sphere of Heaven varied by the figures of the stars.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_431"></A><A HREF="#fn_431"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> But as this self-interpreting</p>

<p>symbol was furnished with wings to facilitate its constant rotation, it is plain that we have in it, not only a World-tree, but also one the central line of whose trunk is one with the axis of heaven and earth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_432"></A><A HREF="#fn_432"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> In the language of Maury, "It is a conception identical with the Yggdrasil of Scandinavian mythology."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_433"></A><A HREF="#fn_433"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> That section of the tree, therefore, which reaches from the abode of men into the holy heavens rises pillar-like from the Pole of the earth to the Pole of the sky.</p>  
<p>Among the Persians the legendary tree of Paradise took on two forms, according as it was viewed with predominant reference to the universe as an organic whole, or to the vegetable world as proceeding from it. In the first aspect it was the Gaokerena (G&ocirc;kard) tree, or "the white H&ocirc;m" (Haoma = Soma); in the second, the "tree of all seeds," the "tree opposed to harm." Of the former it is written, "Every one who eats of it becomes immortal; . . . also in the renovation of the universe they prepare its immortality therefrom; it is the chief of plants."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_434"></A><A HREF="#fn_434"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Of the second we read, "In like manner</p>

<p>as the animals, with grain of fifty and five species and twelve species of medicinal plants, have arisen from the primeval ox, so ten thousand species among the species of principal plants, and a hundred thousand species among ordinary plants, have grown from all these seeds of the tree opposed to harm, the many-seeded. . . . When the seeds of all these plants, with those from the primeval ox, have arisen upon it, every year the bird (Kamros) strips that tree and mingles all the seeds in the water; T&icirc;shtar seizes them with the rain-water and rains them on to all regions."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_435"></A><A HREF="#fn_435"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Where stood this tree which, in its dual form, was at once the source of all other trees and the giver of immortality? Every indication points us to the northern Pole. It was in A&icirc;r&acirc;n-Vej,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_436"></A><A HREF="#fn_436"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the Persian Eden, and this we have already found. It was at the source of all waters, the north polar fountain of Ardv&icirc;-S&ucirc;ra.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_437"></A><A HREF="#fn_437"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> It was begirt with the starry girdle of the zodiacal constellations, which identifies it with the axis of the world.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_438"></A><A HREF="#fn_438"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> It grew on "the highest height of Har&acirc;-berezaiti,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_439"></A><A HREF="#fn_439"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and this is the celestial mountain at the Pole.

<p>The Aryans of India, as early as in the far-off Vedic age, had also their World-tree, which yielded the gods their soma, the drink which maintains immortality. As we should anticipate, its roots are in the Underworld of Yama at the hidden pole, its top in the north polar heaven of the gods, its body is the sustaining axis of the universe.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_441"></A><A HREF="#fn_441"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Weber long ago expressly identified it with the World-ash of the Edda;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_442"></A><A HREF="#fn_442"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and Kuhn,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_443"></A><A HREF="#fn_443"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Senart,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_444"></A><A HREF="#fn_444"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and all the more recent writers accept without question the identification.

<p>The sacred tree of the Buddhists figures largely in their sculpture. An elaborate specimen representation may be seen on the well-known Sanchi Tope. One inconspicuous feature in the representation has often puzzled observers. Almost invariably, at the very top of the tree we find a little umbrella. So universal is this that its absence occasions remark.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_452"></A><A HREF="#fn_452"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> This little piece of symbolism has a curious value. In Buddhist mythological art the umbrella symbolizes the north polar heaven of the gods,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_453"></A><A HREF="#fn_453"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and by attaching it to the tip of the sacred tree the ancient sculptors of this faith unmistakably showed the cosmical character and axial position of that to which it was attached.</p>

He was unable to cross from one bank to the other, but the spirit of the B&ocirc;dhi tree stretched out its arms to him and helped him over in safety. By aid of this tree he attained the summit of wisdom and immortal life. It is the same Tree of the Pole and of Paradise all mythology through. The Tree of the Guarani garden, the Hebrew Eden, the Hindu Jambu-dw&icirc;pa, is likewise the Tree of Nirvana. This final application of the imagery proves its origin. The realm of rest was first seen at the polar centre of the revolving stars."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_456"></A><A HREF="#fn_456"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The ancient Germans called their World-tree the <i>Irmensul</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, "Heaven-pillar." Grimm speaks of its close relationship with the Norse Yggdrasil, and</p>

<p>The Paradise-tree of the Chinese Tauists is also a World-tree. It is found in the centre of the enchanting Garden of the Gods on the summit of the polar Kwen-lun. Its name is Tong, and its location is further defined by the expression that it grows "hard by the closed Gate of Heaven."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_462"></A><A HREF="#fn_462"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> As in many of the ancient religions, the mount on which, after the Flood, the ark rested was considered the same as that from which in the beginning the first man came forth, it is not strange to find the tree on the top of the mountain of Paradise remembered in some of the legends of the Deluge. In the Tauist legend it seems to take the place of the ark. Thus we are told that "one extraordinary antediluvian saved his life by climbing up a mountain, and there and then, in the manner of birds plaiting a nest, he passed his days on a tree, whilst all the country below him was one sheet of water. He afterwards lived to a very old age, and could testify to his late posterity that a whole race of human beings had been swept from the face of the earth."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_463"></A><A HREF="#fn_463"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>It is at least suggestive to find this same idea of salvation from a universal deluge by means of a miraculous tree growing on the top of the divine Mountain of the North among the Navajo Indians of our own country. Speaking of the men of the world before our own, and of the warning they had received of the approaching flood, their legends go on: "Then they took soil from all the <i>four corner mountains of the world</i>, and placed it on top of the mountain that stood <i>in the North;</i> and thither they all went, including the people of the mountains,</p>  
<p>

<p>the salt-woman, and such animals as then lived in the third world. When the soil was laid on the mountain, the latter began to grow higher and higher, but the waters continued to rise, and the people climbed upwards to escape the flood. At length the mountain ceased to grow, and they planted on the summit a great reed, into the hollow of which they all entered. The reed grew every night, but did not grow in the daytime; and this is the reason why the reed grows in joints to this day: the hollow internodes show where it grew by night, and the solid nodes show where it rested by day. Thus the waters gained on them in the daytime. The turkey was the last to take refuge in the reed, and he was therefore at the bottom. When the waters rose high enough to wet the turkey, they all knew that danger was near. Often did the waves wash the end of his tail, and it is for this reason that the tips of the turkey's tail-feathers are to this day lighter than the rest of his plumage. At the end of the fourth night from the time it was planted the reed had grown up to the floor of the fourth world, and here they found a hole through which they passed to the surface."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_464"></A><A HREF="#fn_464"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The opening sentence of the above citation gives us a topography exactly corresponding to Mount Meru, the Hindu "mountain of the North," with its "four corner mountains of the world," in the four opposite points of the horizon. Moreover, in the Deluge myths of the Hindus, as in this of the Navajos,</p>

<p>it was over this central mountain that the survivors of that world-destruction found deliverance. However explained, the coincidences are remarkable.</p>  
<p>In Keltic tradition the Tree of Paradise is represented by the tree which bore golden apples in Avalon. But Avalon is always represented as an island in the far North, and its "loadstone castle" self-evidently connects it with the region of the magnetic Pole.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_465"></A><A HREF="#fn_465"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>In the ancient epic of the Finns, the Kalevala, we see the World-tree of another people. If any doubt could rise as to its position in the universe, the constellation of <i>the Great Bear in its top</i> would suffice to remove it.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_466"></A><A HREF="#fn_466"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

<p>Thus the sacred trees, like the sacred waters, of every ancient people invariably conduct the investigator to lands outside the historic <i>habitats</i> of the peoples in question, and ever to one and the same primeval home-country, the land of light and glory at the Arctic Pole.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_467"></A><A HREF="#fn_467"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_421"></A><A HREF="pf30.htm#fr_421">262:1</A> Was this "tree of knowledge" identical with the "tree of life"? Possibly. "The tradition of Genesis," says Lenormant, <i>Beginnings</i>, p. 84, "at times appears to admit two trees, one of Life and one of Knowledge, and again seems to speak of one only, uniting in itself both attributes (Gen. ii. 17; iii. 1-7)." Compare Ernst von Bunsen, <i>Das Symbol des Kreuzes bei allen Nationen</i>. Berlin, 1876: p. 5. To make the whole account relate to one tree it would only be necessary first to translate the last clause of ch. ii. 9 "the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, <i>even</i> the tree of knowledge of good and evil;" and then the last clause of ch. iii. 22 "and now lest he continue to put forth his hand and to take of the tree of life," etc.,&#151;for both of which constructions there are abundant precedents, if only the <i>gam</i> be rendered with the freedom used in some other passages. As to the first, see 1 Sam. xvii. 40; xxviii. 3; Dan. iv. 10; as to the second, the Hebrew grammars on the use of the future.

In fact, we possess delineations of Osiris as well as of Ptah answering to this description. On a post, on which is graven a human countenance, and which is covered with gay clothing, stands the so-called Tat-pillar, entirely made up of a kind of superimposed capitals, one of which has a rude face scratched upon it, intended, no doubt, to represent the shining sun. On the top of the pillar is placed the complete head-dress of Osiris, the ram's horns, the sun, the ureus-adders, the double feather, all emblems of light and of sovereignty, and which, in my judgment, must have been intended to represent the highest heaven. [See the plate in Wilkinson, M. and C., 2d series, suppt. plate 25 and 33, No. 5. Mariette, <i>Abydos</i>, I., pl. 16.] The Tat-pillar is the symbol of durability, immutability.

At any rate, this is the case so far as the primitive question of creation and of the cosmic system generally is concerned. Mr. Rhys Davids has already remarked that 'the Buddhist archangel or god Brahma is different from anything known to the Brahmans, and is part of an altogether different system of thought' (<i>Buddhist Suttas</i>, p. 168 n.).

<P><A NAME="fn_467"></A><A HREF="pf30.htm#fr_467">277:1</A> Since completing the foregoing chapter I have seen the work entitled <i>Plant Lore, Legends, and Lyrics; embracing the Myths, Traditions, Superstitions, and Folk-lore of the Plant Kingdom</i>. By Richard Folkard, Jun. London, 1884. In the first three chapters the reader will find valuable supplementary reading on "The World-Trees of the Ancients," "The Trees of Paradise," "The Tree of Adam," "Sacred Trees of all Nations," etc. Other chapters treat of "Plant Symbolism," "Plant Language," and of the fabulous trees and miracle plants which play so important a part in the history of religious and scientific credulity. Should any reader thereof be inclined to claim that "the progress of science" has forever done away with such ignorant medi&aelig;val mystagogy, he will do well to turn to <i>The Weekly Inter-Ocean</i>, Chicago, Dec. 11, 1884, in which, in an illustrated article entitled "The Tree of Life," we are informed that "science has now discovered in a most unexpected manner both the Tree and the River of Life." The former is the brain and spinal cord of man. "We do not mean that the brain merely looks like a tree or resembles one externally. We are not dealing with analogies. But we do mean that the brain and spinal cord are an actual tree. By the most rigid scientific examination it is shown to fill the ideal type and plan of a tree more completely than any tree of the vegetable kingdom. The spinal cord is the trunk of this great tree. Its roots are the nerves of feeling and motion branching out over the body. . . . The Tree of Life is planted in the midst of many others, for the heart is a tree, the lungs are a tree, and the pancreas, stomach, liver, and all those vital organs. The brain is its radiant and graceful foliage. The mental faculties are classified in twelve groups by the most recent scientific analysis. This Tree bears twelve kinds of fruit. . . . On each side of the Tree of Life is the great River of Life. Let us lay a man down with his head to the north, and his arms stretched to the west and to the east. The River of Life has its four heads in the four chambers of the heart, the two auricles and the two ventricles. The branches of this river pass upward to the head, 'the land of gold,' <A NAME="page_278"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 278</FONT></A> eastward to the left and westward to the right arm and lung. But greatest of all the branches, 'The River, or Phrath,' are the aorta and vena cava, reaching southward to the trunk and lower limbs. In branching over the body this river divides into four parts at seventeen different points. Two branches of the river form a network around the very trunk of the tree, and spread upward among its expanding branches. The blood is the 'Water of Life,' and it looks 'as clear as crystal' when seen through the microscope, the eye of science. It is three fourths water, and through this are diffused the red cells and the living materials which are to construct and to maintain the bodily organs." Had this article and its antique-looking illustration been found in one of the Church fathers, it would have afforded to a certain class of "scientists" great edification.</P>
