### SECTION VII.—LATEST POLAR RESEARCH.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> recent happy issue of the last of the
three relief-expeditions sent out by the United States government for
the rescue of Lieutenant Greely and his starving band of heroes has
given unusual popular interest to the great international undertaking in
which he and his men were so perilously engaged. Still very few,
comparatively speaking, understand the scope and promise of this first
really adequate and hopeful scheme for the investigation of Terrestrial
Physics near the Pole. Mr. O. B. Cole, in 1883, described its inception
and purpose as follows:—

The representatives of ten nations besides our own are engaged in it;
the fields of observation are in both the Arctic

<span id="page_488">p. 488</span>

and Antarctic, as well as the intermediate regions of the globe; there
have been established eighteen Polar stations, and upwards of forty
auxiliary stations; the observations have been made during the year
which will end with the present month—that is, between September 1,
1882, and September I, 1883; they have been made and recorded daily, and
bear upon the same identical points of inquiry. This scheme of
observation originated with Lieutenant Charles Weyprecht, an Austrian
explorer of fame, who, however, did not live to see it carried into
execution. He first broached it at a meeting of German naturalists and
physicists held at Gratz on September 18, 1875. The plan was formally
approved at a meeting of the International Meteorological Congress held
in Rome in the spring of 1879, and its details were perfected at other
meetings of the same body held in Hamburg, October 1, 1879, and at
Berne, August 7, 1880. Finally, on August 1, 1881, ten delegates, of
whom General Hazen, chief of the United States Signal Service, was one,
met at St. Petersburg and organized an official Polar Commission. All
the members of this commission had authority to act for their respective
governments.

The Polar stations were assigned among the nations as follows: The
United States, at Lady Franklin Bay, Grinnell Land, and Point Barrow,
Alaska; Great Britain and Canada, at Fort McRae and Fort Resolution, on
the Great Slave Lake, in British America; Denmark, at Godthaab and
Upernavik, on the west coast of Greenland; Germany, at Hogarth Inlet,
Cumberland Sound; Austria, at Young Foreland, Jan Mayen Island, north of
Iceland; Finland, at Soudan Kyla, in Lapland; Holland, at Dickerson
Haven, mouth of the Yenisee River, in Russia; Norway, at Bossekop,
northwestern coast of Norway; Sweden, at Mosel Bay, Spitzbergen; and
Russia, at Moller Bay, Nova Zembla, and Lighthouse Point, at the mouth
of the Lena River. The Antarctic stations are those of Germany, on the
South Georgia Islands; France, at Cape Horn; Italy, at Punta Arenas, in
Patagonia; and the Argentine Republic, at Cordoba. The Polar stations
are all within thirty degrees of the North or the South Pole, and the
auxiliary stations are spread over the rest of the habitable globe. In
his original presentation of the scheme Lieutenant Weyprecht remarked
that the unsatisfactory scientific results of the various Arctic and
Antarctic expeditions are owing mainly to two causes: first, that the
primary object of these expeditions

<span id="page_489">p. 489</span>

has been geographical discovery, while scientific investigation was
secondary; and, secondly, that these individual voyages have been of an
isolated character, and hence the observations made are necessarily
deficient as compared with what would be gained by a properly scientific
investigation, which should obtain, for combination and comparison,
memoranda of magnetic and meteorological observations simultaneously
made in all parts of the world under a uniform system. Such an
investigation, he said, would be feasible only by the united action of
the great nations of the world.

By the plan adopted, the following schedule of work was agreed upon for
each of the several stations: Meteorological observations: temperature
of the air, temperature of the sea, barometric pressure, humidity,
direction and force of wind, kind, amount, and motion of the clouds,
rainfall, and weather and optical phenomena. Magnetic observations:
absolute declination, absolute inclination, absolute horizontal
intensity, variations of declination and inclination, and variations of
horizontal intensity. All these observations were considered obligatory,
and were to be made at each station hourly each day, excepting on the
1st and 15th of each month, when the readings were to be made every five
minutes. The following observations were considered desirable, and
doubtless have generally been made: Variations of temperature, with
height, solar radiation, evaporation, galvanic earth currents, parallax
of the aurora, spectroscopic observations on the aurora, ocean currents,
tidal observations, structure of ice, density of sea-water, atmospheric
electricity, and the force of gravity. The several expeditions were
started in season to arrive at their respective stations by the date
assigned for beginning, September 1, 1882. . . .

The station of the party of Lieutenant Greely at Lady Franklin Bay is
the most northerly one of the whole, and is but about eight degrees
south of the Pole. It is very difficult of access on account of the
masses of ice that collect in Baffin's Bay. It was arrived at in a
vessel by Lieutenant Greely, though the start was made a year in advance
of most of the other expeditions, under an apprehension that the vessel
might be stopped by ice, and a long journey have to be made overland.
The consequence is that the observations of this party began in the fall
of 1881. It was the intention, however, to remain two years, and various
stores were laid in and arrangements

<span id="page_490">p. 490</span>

were made accordingly. Early in the summer of 1882 a steamer was sent by
the government with supplies for the party, but was unable to reach them
because of the ice. The supplies were left at points designated
beforehand by Lieutenant Greely, whence he could convey them to
headquarters by sledges. Another party was started this summer, and if
they cannot reach him by navigation will employ sledges and push north
till they meet him. He has instructions to retreat this season by sledge
in the contingency of the non-arrival of a vessel, and to come down the
coast of Grinnell Land. Either by vessel or on these coast-line sledge
journeys the two parties will undoubtedly meet, and probably something
definite will be heard from them by the end of September. <span

Point Barrow is on the northern or Arctic Ocean shore of Alaska, in
latitude 72° north. The party stationed here is in charge of Lieutenant
P. H. Ray. A relief vessel visited the place in the summer of 1882, and
found all well. The observers reported that the preceding winter had
been long and severe, but not exceeding in these respects what had been
expected. Hourly meteorological observations had been kept up
uninterruptedly from October 17, 1881, and magnetic observations from
December 1. From that date to August 1, 1882, over 90,000 readings of
the magnetic instruments were taken, and a corresponding amount of
meteorological work had been done. <span id="fr_728"></span>[2](#fn_728)

 

Last summer, just before the world had learned of the rescue of
Lieutenant Greely, the commanders of all the different stations, Greely
alone excepted, held a conference in Vienna, and congratulated each
other and the scientific world upon the success achieved. The recovery
of the extremely valuable observations of the then missing officer has
now crowned and completed the

<span id="page_491">p. 491</span>

grandest and most beneficent enterprise in which the Christian nations
have for centuries, if indeed ever, engaged. Most remarkable, perhaps,
of all is the fact that in these several expeditions more than five
hundred men, of various nationalities, were kept more than a full year
within the Arctic Circle, transported thither and returned, and yet, but
for a single mistake in provisioning one of the parties, not one life
would have been sacrificed. What could be fuller of promise with respect
to the future of polar exploration?

It is to be feared that stratigraphic and paleontologic questions have
had too little consideration on the part of the scientific commissions
which have planned the latest (as well as the earlier) Arctic
expeditions. Whoever has read the fascinating pages of Heer's "*Flora
Fossilis Arctica*," and Count Saporta's "Monde des Plantes avant
l’Apparition de l’Homme" (see his chart opposite p. 128), and Baron
Nordenskjöld's exceedingly interesting researches and studies in
Spitzbergen, cannot well avoid the conviction that the pick and shovel
and hammer, intelligently applied anywhere within the Arctic Circle, are
almost certain to give us facts of inestimable value both to natural
science and to archæology.
