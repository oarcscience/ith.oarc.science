<p><small>And the Greeks, who surpassed all men in ingenuity, appropriated to themselves the greater part of these things, exaggerating them, and adding to them various ornaments which they wove into this foundation in every style, in order to charm by the elegance of the myths. Hence Hesiod and the famed cyclic poets drew their theogonies, their gigantomachies, their mutilations of the gods, and in hawking them about everywhere they have supplanted the true narrative. And our ears, accustomed to their fictions, familiar to us for several centuries past, guard as a precious deposit the fables which they received by tradition, as I remarked when I began to speak; and, rooted by time, this belief has become so difficult to dislodge that to the greater number the truth appears like a story told for amusement, while the corruption of the tradition is looked upon as the truth itself&#151;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Philo of Byblos</span>.</small></p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Summing</span> up the most probable results of all his investigations, Darwin states as his opinion that man must be considered as "descended from a hairy quadruped, furnished with a tail and pointed ears, probably arboreal in his habits, and an inhabitant of the Old World."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_531"></A><A HREF="#fn_531"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>According to H&auml;ckel, this <i>Homo primigenius</i> was a blackish, woolly-haired, prognathous, ape-like being, with a long, narrow head. His body was entirely covered with hair, and he was unable to speak.</p>  
<p>In reading most fashionable writers upon ancient mythology and literature, one would think that they conceived of the writers of the Vedic Hymns and the authors of the myths of classic literature as very early and but slightly developed descendants of this hairy <i>Homo Darwinius</i>.

"The power of gazing upward to heaven," he says, "came to us not all at once, but gradually, through lapse of time. Savages are said scarcely ever to raise their eyes, and their heads are naturally inclined with a downward gaze, so that it must be an effort for them to look at the sky and the heavenly bodies. Primeval man lived upon roots and berries, or on the lesser animals and the vermin which he gathered from the soil, and so habit as well as nature kept his eyes fixed upon the ground. We need not therefore wonder if, in their half-glances upward, our forefathers had not leisure to observe that the tree-top was <i>not really</i> close against the sky. They may well have deemed that the upper branches hid themselves in infinitely remote ethereal regions."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_533"></A><A HREF="#fn_533"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The work which such men make in interpreting ancient literature and thought is strange enough. The ascription to Agni of the same supreme worship which the bard has just paid to Varuna or Mitra is explained as due to the extreme "shortness of the memory" of early men.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_534"></A><A HREF="#fn_534"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Only a knowledge of</p>

<p>a most limited portion of the earth's surface can be conceded to any of the ancient nations. The early Aryans sing of the Ocean and of ships of an hundred oars, but it must not for a moment be supposed that they had ever seen or heard of the real Ocean; they had simply originated in their imaginations a mythical one.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_535"></A><A HREF="#fn_535"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> In such hands the immortal Iliad becomes merely "a tale of land-battle, the theatre of whose action is limited to the two shores of the &AElig;g&aelig;an, the known world of the Greek."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_536"></A><A HREF="#fn_536"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Though the Homeric poems betray in various places an acquaintance with astronomy, and actually name various constellations, yet, when the question is raised as to how the poet conceived of the return of the sun during the night from the West to the East, even Mr. Bunbury silences us, telling us that in Homer's day nobody had ever thought of such a question!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_537"></A><A HREF="#fn_537"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Illustrations of this worse than medi&aelig;val ignorance and distortion of ancient thought and language could be multiplied to almost any extent. But as some selection must be made, it may perhaps be best to confine ourselves to three or four points in a field comparatively familiar to all readers likely to peruse these pages,&#151;the field of Homeric cosmology.

<p>shall make it plain that those interpreters of Homer whose conceptions of Greek culture are derived from current Darwinistic anthropology rather than from the poems themselves, demonstrate, by the number and character of their exegetical entanglements, the entire incorrectness of their fundamental assumption.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_538"></A><A HREF="#fn_538"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>1. The question just touched upon, the Movement of the Sun, is as good as any with which to begin, and by which to show the embarrassments into which accepted interpreters have continually fallen in consequence of denying to the ancients a knowledge of the spherical figure of the Earth.</p>  
<p>Opening Keightley, we find the customary assertion that "according to the ideas of the Homeric and Hesiodic ages the Earth was a round, flat disk, around which the river Ocean flowed." Then he says that "men, seeing the sun rise in the East and set in the West each day, were naturally led to inquire how his return to the East was effected." He alludes to the fact that "in the Odyssey, when Helios ends his diurnal career, he is said to go under the Earth;" but he adds that "it is not easy to determine whether the poet meant that he then passed through Tar-taros back to the East during the night." The "beautiful fiction of the solar cup or basin," he thus describes: "If, then, as there is reason to suppose, it was the popular belief that a lofty mountainous ring ran round the edge of the Earth, it was easy for the poets to feign that on reaching the western</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_330"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 330</FONT></A></p>  
<p>stream of Ocean Helios himself, his chariot and his horses, were received into a magic cup or boat, made by Hephaistos, which, aided by the current, conveyed him during the night round the northern part of the earth, where his light was only enjoyed by the happy Hyperboreans, the lofty Rhiph&aelig;ans concealing it from the rest of mankind. They must also have supposed that the cup continued its course during the day, compassing the earth every twenty-four hours." Of this fiction, however, Keightley confesses, "neither Homer nor Hesiod evinces any knowledge." After quoting various later poets, therefore, he concludes as follows: "From a consideration of all these passages it may seem to follow that the ideas of the poets on this subject were very vague and fleeting. Perhaps the prevalent opinion was that the Sun rested himself and his weary steeds in the West, and <i>then returned to the East</i>."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_539"></A><A HREF="#fn_539"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> By what passage, however, whether <i>via</i> the North or underneath the supposed "flat disk" of the Earth, Keightley makes no further effort to determine.</p>  
<p>The difficulty in the way of supposing that in Homer's thought the nocturnal sun passed underneath the flat Earth-disk, through Tartaros, back to the East, is that the poet invariably represents this Underworld as forever unvisited by sunlight. In view of this, and of the ominous silence of Homer as to any winged cup sailing round the earth to the North, some interpreters warn us against expecting any consistency of thought in poetry so primitive.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_540"></A><A HREF="#fn_540"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Schwenck goes so far in this direction as to suggest that the island Aiai&egrave; is a creation of the imagination in the far West, called forth for the express purpose of giving the mind a kind of resting-place, where it can leave the sinking Helios without troubling itself with inconvenient speculations as to how he is to get back to the Orient at the appointed hour. He says: "The Homeric poetry could not allow the Sun and the daylight to rest during the night in the Homeric Hades, for in that case Hades would have been illuminated. It therefore supposes an island afar off at the end of the world, where Helios and Dawn, after they have passed over across the heavens, repose at night, and whence, after this repose, they in the morning again ascend the sky. An exact explanation as to how they come westwardly to this island and then in the morning rise in the East lies aloof from the poetry, for in Homer nothing of systems is to be found, and only each object taken by itself is correct and clear."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_541"></A><A HREF="#fn_541"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Assume once a spherical Earth, and all these difficulties of the interpreters are at an end. East and West touch each other. Mr. Gladstone, before abandoning fully the flat-earth theory, came as near the truth as he possibly could and not hit it, when, speaking of Helios, he wrote: "The fact of his sporting with the oxen night and morning goes far to show that Homer did not think of the Earth as a plane, but round, perhaps, as upon a cylinder, and</p>

<p>believed that the West and East were in contact."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_542"></A><A HREF="#fn_542"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> He mistook, however, in suggesting Thrinakia as the place of contact. It was rather on the meridian of Aiai&egrave;, for we are expressly told that</p>

<p>Nor could anything be more natural than that the poet, conceiving of the world of living men as Homer did, and sending out his thoughts eastward and westward in search of the meeting-place of evening and morning, should fix upon the meridian opposite his own, the very place and only place where his eastward-journeying thought and his westward journeying thought would of necessity meet. His eastern hemisphere would naturally extend round eastward until it met the edge of the hemisphere extending round westward. On that farthest off meridian,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_544"></A><A HREF="#fn_544"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> therefore, he made the old day give place to the new, eve to morn. That was the doubtful line on which Odysseus and his companions were no longer clear: "where was East and where was West, where Helios went behind the Earth or where he rose again."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_545"></A><A HREF="#fn_545"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>2. The false assumption that Homer's Earth is flat has created all the noted controversies connected with his representations of the location of Hades. This question has divided Homeric interpreters into more than a dozen differing camps. Their mutually</p>

<p>contradictory solutions of the problem would be the laughing-stock of the opposers of classical studies, were these latter only sufficiently acquainted with the world's scholarship to be aware of their existence. To review and solve the question in this place would detain the general reader too long, but in the Appendix, Section sixth, the assertions here made will be found abundantly verified.</p>  
<p>3. The same flat-earth assumption is further responsible for all the difficulties which interpreters have found in representing the Ocean, and in general the Water System of the Earth, in accordance with the Homeric data.</p>  
<p>These difficulties have been neither few nor small. Four of them we will here notice. And, first, that growing out of the statement that from deep-flowing Ocean "flow all rivers and every sea, and all fountains and deep wells." &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_546"></A><A HREF="#fn_546"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> V&ouml;lcker pronounces this "hard to explain." He says, "An immediate in-streaming of the Ocean into the sea can scarcely be meant, partly because sea-water and ocean-water do not unite, partly because Homer knows of no such in-streamings in the Phasis and at the Pillars of Hercules, and the origination of rivers in this way would not be thinkable."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_547"></A><A HREF="#fn_547"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Other writers, devoted to the illustration of ancient thought, seem not to have stopped to inquire whether rivers flowing up-stream from the Ocean to the hills were thinkable or not, and have gravely set before the youthful student diagrams constructed on this plan as the true representation of Homeric thought!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_548"></A><A HREF="#fn_548"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_334"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 334</FONT></A></p>  
<p>A second embarrassing question has been this: "If the Ocean-stream surrounded and constituted the outermost boundary of the Earth-disk, what sustained the Ocean-stream itself and constituted its further shore?" As V&ouml;lcker says, "Who on the further side held in the billows of the vast World-river, that they did not flow off into the empty spaces of heaven? Was it a narrow strip of the inner Earth, or was it formless chaos, or the descending rim of the sky, or the inner power of the waters themselves?"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_549"></A><A HREF="#fn_549"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Buchholz says, "By what the Ocean itself was in turn bounded remains unclear. The child-like imagination of the Homeric age contented itself with that confused <i>halbverschwommene</i> conception."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_550"></A><A HREF="#fn_550"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> The most natural answer, especially from the point of view represented by Buchholz, who, with Ukert and others, claims that the Homeric heaven was literally metallic, would seem to be V&ouml;lcker's third supposition, namely, that the rim of the metallic sky constitutes the outer limit of the Ocean-stream.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_551"></A><A HREF="#fn_551"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> This would correspond, also, with the general notion that the circular disk of the earth "divided the hollow sphere of the universe into two equal parts."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_552"></A><A HREF="#fn_552"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> It would also exactly correspond to</p>  
<p>

<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_335"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 335</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Flach's curious and elaborate representation of the Hesiodic world in his recent work on the Hesiodic cosmogony.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_553"></A><A HREF="#fn_553"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Still further it would seem best to accord with Homer's language describing the heavenly constellations as bathing in the Ocean. On the other hand, however, such a supposition would be incompatible with the Homeric representation that the farther shore presented a suitable landing-place, and especially a landing-place situated, like that of Odysseus, in the Underworld. Moreover, it would be incompatible with the current notion that the Homeric heaven was supported upon mountain pillars <i>standing on the Earth inside</i> the Ocean-stream, like Mount Atlas in western Libya.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_554"></A><A HREF="#fn_554"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Again, therefore, the question returns, "Given a flat Earth surrounded by the Ocean-river, what constitutes the farther shore, and how can the mariner who lands upon it speak of himself as in the Underworld?" The learned V&ouml;lcker leaves the subject with the unsatisfying observation, "The poet has not answered our questions."</p>  
<p>A third embarrassment dwelt upon by the same advocate of the flat-earth theory is that, as he understands Homer, Hellas was the centre of the circular Earth-disk, and not more than "ten or eleven days&#146; sail" from the Ocean in any direction; and yet the poet makes it eighteen days&#146; sail by the shortest route from Ogygia to the land of the Ph&aelig;acians, and at least another in the same direction to</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_336"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 336</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Hellas, and yet Ogygia is the navel or centre of the sea. "These," says he, "are insurmountable difficulties for him who would measure with the compasses. Rather should we learn from this example what folk-faith and folk-tales are. Where there is no agreement we should not create one by main force. The Earth is circular and Hellas is its centre; that was the popular faith. But the situation of the Ocean and the extent of the Earth are at the same time such fluctuating ideas, and all any way extended voyages seem to the poet to extend to such a terrific distance, that it may well happen to him to overpass all bounds out in that realm where were, so to speak, the most terrific of all distances."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_555"></A><A HREF="#fn_555"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Thus the nodding Homer is again caught in contradiction, and to accommodate his exaggerated and terrific distances even Gladstone at first felt constrained to change the figure of the Earth-disk itself, and to present it as a vast parallelogram more extended from North to South than from East to West.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_556"></A><A HREF="#fn_556"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The fourth difficulty involved in the current interpretation is that experienced in harmonizing the poet's representations of the Ocean, as commonly understood, with his representations of the movements of the sun, as commonly understood. The sun at evening certainly ceases to be visible to men. According to the Homeric representation he returns to the flowing of the Ocean.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_557"></A><A HREF="#fn_557"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> His bright light sinks in it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_558"></A><A HREF="#fn_558"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> At his rising it is also from the Ocean</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_337"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 337</FONT></A></p>  
<p>that he begins to mount the sky.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_559"></A><A HREF="#fn_559"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Yet his setting is also described as a going &#0949;&#7990;&#0962; &#8017;&#0960;&#8056; &#0947;&#0945;&#8150;&#0945;&#0957;, under or behind the Earth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_560"></A><A HREF="#fn_560"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> How now, with a flat circular disk for the Earth, and with a circumfluent Ocean in the same plane, and with an eternally dark and un-sunned Hades just beyond the Ocean-river to the westward, can these data be harmonized? If we attempt to conceive of the Sun as literally sinking in the ocean and hiding his light beneath its waters, he has not gone &#0949;&#7990;&#0962; &#8017;&#0960;&#8056; &#0947;&#0945;&#8150;&#0945;&#0957;, but rather "in under" the Ocean. Moreover, the old difficulty reappears as to how he shall get round into the East in time for his rising again. Furthermore, if he is the whole night concealed under the waves of the Ocean, descending into it in the far West at his setting and ascending out of it in the far East at his rising, how can we arrange for his rejoicing himself night and morning with his oxen on the island of Thrinakia?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_561"></A><A HREF="#fn_561"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> But we cannot abandon this whole supposition, and let the Sun set <i>beyond</i> and <i>behind</i> the Ocean-stream, for that would be in the western Hades, where he never shines. Nor yet, again, can we say that he descends to the surface of the Ocean simply, and then, in his "cup," or otherwise, moves round to the Orient by way of the North, for then, the Ocean being in substantially the same plane as the abode of men, they would not be overspread with darkness, but would enjoy, if not the spectacle of "the midnight sun," at least the full light of a sun moving round the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_338"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 338</FONT></A></p>  
<p>horizon. On this supposition, too, Hades, just west of the river, would also be equally illuminated. <i>Inside</i> the Ocean-stream he certainly does not hide himself in the ground, for that would be incompatible with all the passages associating his rising and setting with the Ocean. But if he cannot be conceived of as setting on the hither side of the stream, nor on the farther side, nor yet as resting on the Ocean, nor yet as hiding beneath it, what possible conception of the matter remains?</p>  
<p>All this trouble is the natural result of one false assumption,&#151;the assumption that Homer's Earth is a flat disk. Assume that it is a sphere, and every one of these difficulties vanishes. Then, in causing the Sun to descend to the Ocean in which lies Aiai&egrave; the poet makes the bed to which the king of day retires the same as that from which in the morning he rises again. At the same time, from the poet's standpoint and from the standpoint of the lands inhabited by the poet's countrymen, each setting of the Sun was a going "behind the earth," to reappear on the opposite side. This view of the movement of Helios solves every perplexity; and if Homer had the knowledge of the Earth and Heavens involved in the view, we may be sure he also knew as well as we do in what sense the Ocean is the source of all springs and rivers, and for what reason the equatorial Ocean never runs away for the lack of an ultra-terrestrial shore.</p>  
<p>4. The same hermeneutical myopia which has thus minified and misconceived every feature of Homer's cosmography has introduced and maintained the now universal dogma that in the Homeric poems "Olympos is always the Thessalian mountain" of</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_339"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 339</FONT></A></p>  
<p>that name.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_562"></A><A HREF="#fn_562"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> All our youth are taught that "the early poets believed that the gods actually lived upon the top of this mountain separating Macedonia and Thessaly. Even the fable of the giants scaling heaven must be understood in a literal sense; not that they placed Pelion and Ossa upon <i>the top</i> of Olympos to reach the still higher <i>heaven</i>, but that they piled Pelion on the top of Ossa and both on the <i>lower slopes</i> of Olympos to scale the summit of Olympos itself, the abode of the gods."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_563"></A><A HREF="#fn_563"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> To settle the question negatively as well as positively, revered German erudition solemnly declares, "The gods of Homer <i>never</i> live in heaven."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_564"></A><A HREF="#fn_564"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Such dogmatism challenges a fresh investigation of the question.</p>  
<p>Taking up this subject, Keightley remarks that if we were to follow the teachings of Comparative Mythology we should have to locate the abode of Homer's gods in the heights of heaven. His language is: "Were we to follow analogy, and argue from the cosmology of other races of men, we would say that the upper surface of the superior hemisphere was the abode of the Grecian gods."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_565"></A><A HREF="#fn_565"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> He goes on to allude to the conceptions of the Scandinavians and some other peoples, and adds, "Hence we might be led to infer that Olympos, the abode of the Grecian gods, was synonymous with heaven, and that the Thessalian mountain and those others which bore the same name were called after the original heavenly hill."</p>  
<p>It is a pity that the learned author could not have</p>

<p>accepted this very sensible conclusion; but he did not. Rejecting the admitted intimations of Comparative Cosmology, he says, "A careful survey, however, of those passages in Homer and Hesiod in which Olympos occurs will lead us to believe that the Ach&aelig;ans held the Thessalian Olympos, the highest mountain with which they were acquainted, to be the abode of their gods."</p>  
<p>The only passage specially referred to by Keightley, as establishing this view, is the Iliad, xiv. 225 <i>seq</i>., where the language employed is not at all inconsistent with the idea that, in descending from the summit of Olympos, Hera descended from the northern sky. More elaborate is the argument of V&ouml;lcker,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_566"></A><A HREF="#fn_566"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> but its logical cogency is by no means admissible.</p>  
<p>The true Homeric conception of the abode of the gods is far loftier, grander, and more poetic than that given us by such interpreters. According to the poet's real representation, that abode is "the wide heaven,"&#151;not the atmospheric heaven, &#0959;&#8016;&#0961;&#0945;&#0957;&#8056;&#0957; &#7952;&#0957; &#0945;&#7984;&#0952;&#8051;&#0961;&#0953; &#0954;&#0945;&#8054; &#0957;&#0949;&#0966;&#8051;&#0955;&#8131;&#0963;&#0953;&#0957;, for this is a special possession of Zeus (Iliad, xv. 192); it is the upper sky,</p>

<p>the celestial dome in which sun, moon, and stars wheel silently around the Pole. To the early Greek, as to the early Perso-Aryan, it was easy to conceive of this celestial dome as a heavenly mountain, vast, majestic, of unearthly beauty, and peopled with glorious beings invisible to mortals. And this heavenly mountain he called Olympos. The Thessalian mount, the Bithynian, and all the dozen others of the same name&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_567"></A><A HREF="#fn_567"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> were sacred only so far as they symbolized and commemorated their heavenly original. In the Odyssey, xi. 315, it is plain that Homer speaks of the Thessalian Olympos along with other Thessalian mountains;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_568"></A><A HREF="#fn_568"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> but in general he means by Olympos the heights of the northern heaven viewed as the proper abode of the gods.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_569"></A><A HREF="#fn_569"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>

<p>we are told that Iris and Thetis were impelled up "to heaven" (&#7952;&#0962; &#0959;&#8016;&#0961;&#0945;&#0957;&#8056;&#0957;). But the moment the Father of gods and men begins discourse, he says, "Thou hast come to Olympos, O goddess Thetis;" and in verse one hundred twenty-one the bard resumes, "Thus he spoke; nor did the silver-footed goddess Thetis disobey, but rushing impetuously, she descended down from the tops of Olympos."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_574"></A><A HREF="#fn_574"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>One of the most vivid of the pictures of Olympian life in the whole Iliad is that portraying (book xv. 14 ff.) the punishment of Hera by Zeus. In the literal translation of Buckley, it is thus rendered: "O Hera, of evil arts, impracticable, thy stratagem has made noble Hector cease from battle, and put his troops to flight. Indeed, I know not whether again thou mayst not be the first to reap the fruits of thy pernicious machinations, and I chastise thee with stripes. Dost thou not remember when thou didst swing from on high, and I hung two anvils from thy feet, and bound a golden chain around thy hands, that could not be broken? And thou didst hang in the air and clouds, and the gods commiserated thee throughout lofty Olympos; but standing around, they were not able to release thee; but whomsoever I caught, seizing, I hurled from the threshold <i>of heaven</i> till he reached the earth, hardly breathing."</p>  
<p>Although the words "of heaven" are supplied by the translator, the contrast required by the expression</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_344"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 344</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> "reached the earth" compels the supply in order to make good sense.</p>  
<p>In book first Hephaistos gives his own account of this same hurling out of heaven. He says, "Be patient, my mother, and although grieved restrain thyself, lest with my own eyes I behold thee beaten, being very dear to me; nor then, though full of grief, should I be able to assist thee, for Olympian Zeus is difficult to be opposed. For upon a time before this, when I desired to assist thee, having seized me by the foot, he cast me down from the heavenly threshold (&#0946;&#0951;&#0955;&#0959;&#8166; &#0952;&#0949;&#0963;&#0960;&#0949;&#0963;&#0943;&#0959;&#0953;&#0959;).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_575"></A><A HREF="#fn_575"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> The whole day was I hurled, and at the setting of the sun I fell on Lemnos, and but little of life remained in me."</p>  
<p>Nothing can well be plainer than that this whole scene is conceived of as occurring high in the vault of heaven. To locate it on any "many-peaked mountain" every way embarrasses the imagination.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_576"></A><A HREF="#fn_576"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Moreover, Lemnos is not situated under Thessalian</p>

<p><A NAME="page_345"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 345</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Olympos, nor could the word &#0954;&#0940;&#0960;&#0960;&#0949;&#0963;&#0959;&#0957; describe Hephaistos's motion in space from the one to the other. So irresistible, indeed, is the right interpretation that Keightley, unconscious of his inconsistency, elsewhere says, "The favorite haunt of Hephaistos on earth was the isle of Lemnos. It was here he fell when flung <i>from heaven</i> by Zeus for attempting to aid his mother Hera."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_577"></A><A HREF="#fn_577"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> In like manner Professor Geddes, with a forgetfulness equally entertaining, writes of Zeus "hurling Hephaistos over the <i>celestial battlements</i>," and of his being "able to draw gods and earth and sea aloft <i>into the sky</i>."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_578"></A><A HREF="#fn_578"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The not less famous passage in the opening lines of book eighth is even more conclusive: "Whomsoever of the gods I shall discover, having gone apart from the rest, wishing to aid either the Trojans or the Greeks, disgracefully smitten shall he return to Olympos; or, seizing, I will hurl him into gloomy Tartaros, very far hence, where there is a very deep gulf beneath the earth, and iron portals, and a brazen threshold,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_579"></A><A HREF="#fn_579"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> as far below Hades as heaven is from earth; then shall he know by how much I am the most powerful of all the gods. But come, ye gods, and try me, that ye may all know. Having suspended a golden chain from heaven, do all ye gods and goddesses suspend yourselves therefrom; yet would ye not draw down from heaven to earth your supreme counselor Jove, not even if ye labor ever so much: but whenever I, desiring, should</p>

</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_346"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 346</FONT></A></p>  
<p>wish to pull it, I could draw it up together, earth, and ocean, and all; then, indeed, would I bind the chain around the top of Olympos, and all these should hang aloft. By so much do I surpass both gods and men."</p>  
<p>Comment is unnecessary. Until the whole of a thing can be suspended upon and supported by a part of itself, no interpreter can make the top of Olympos in this passage signify the top of a mountain in Thessaly.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_580"></A><A HREF="#fn_580"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>If any further evidence can be needed to show that no mountain of earth can meet the requirements of the language of the Iliad respecting Olympos, it is surely afforded in the passages already alluded to where suppliants, addressing the gods as "Olympian," are said to stretch forth their hands toward "the starry heavens." An example of this is the following: "But the guardian of the Greeks, Gerenian Nestor, most particularly prayed, stretching forth his hands to the starry heaven: 'O Father Zeus, if ever any one in fruitful Argos, to thee burning the fat thighs of either oxen or sheep, supplicated that he might return, and thou didst promise</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_347"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 347</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and assent, be mindful of these things, O Olympian, and avert the cruel day.'"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_581"></A><A HREF="#fn_581"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Nor is the language of the Odyssey less opposed to the prevailing interpretation. Here Olympos is metaphorically spoken of precisely as we speak of heaven: "For Olympos hath given me grief" (iv. 722). Again, in a memorable passage, it is depicted in terms which plainly belong to no sublunary sphere: "Thus having spoken, blue-eyed Athen&egrave; departed to Olympos, where they say is forever the firm seat of the gods; it is neither shaken by the winds, nor is it ever bedewed by the shower, nor does the snow approach it; but a most cloudless serenity is spread out, and white splendor runs over it, in which the blessed gods are delighted all their days. To this place Athen&egrave; departed when she had admonished the damsel."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_582"></A><A HREF="#fn_582"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>In book xx. 30, Athen&egrave; descends "from heaven" (&#0959;&#8016;&#0961;&#0945;&#0957;&#0972;&#0952;&#0949;&#0957; &#0954;&#0945;&#0964;&#0945;&#0946;&#8118;&#0963;&#0945;), while in line 55 her return is described as "to Olympos." So in line 103 Zeus thunders</p>

<p>So unmistakable is this language and the entire usage of the Odyssey that various recent writers, not emancipated from the traditional view as respects the Iliad, have yet perceived and admitted the identity of &#8012;&#0955;&#0965;&#0956;&#0960;&#0959;&#0962; and the upper &#0959;&#8016;&#0961;&#0945;&#0957;&#0972;&#0962; in the former work. Among German scholars, Faesi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_585"></A><A HREF="#fn_585"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and Ihne&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_586"></A><A HREF="#fn_586"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> have expressed themselves in this sense, and prominent among the Scotch, Professor Geddes.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_587"></A><A HREF="#fn_587"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> The latter says, "There is nothing in the Odyssey which obliges us to think of <i>Mount</i> Olympos." Testimony from such a quarter is of course all the more convincing.</p>  
<p>In Homeric thought, then, the abode of the gods was where we should antecedently expect to find it, namely, in the heights of heaven. Considered with reference to the august sovereign of gods and men,</p>

<p>the polar sky-arch was a palace, the royal residence, the &#0948;&#8182;&#0956;&#0945; or &#0948;&#0972;&#0956;&#0959;&#0962; of Zeus.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_588"></A><A HREF="#fn_588"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Viewed with reference to its tints, steel-blue and gold, it was described as metallic, &#0963;&#0953;&#0948;&#8053;&#0961;&#0949;&#0959;&#0962;, &#0967;&#0940;&#0955;&#0954;&#0949;&#0959;&#0962; and &#0960;&#0959;&#0955;&#8059;&#0967;&#0945;&#0955;&#0954;&#0959;&#0962;, terms which metallic interpreters like Voss and Buchholz and Bunbury have pushed to absolute literalness.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_589"></A><A HREF="#fn_589"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Conceived of as an ethereal height, it was pictured as a heaven-high mount, "snowy" as its own white clouds. Then to the climbing imagination, mounting height above height in the vain attempt to reach the summit, the mountain became &#0945;&#7984;&#0960;&#8059;&#0962; (Il., V. 367, 869; xv. 84); &#0956;&#0945;&#0954;&#0961;&#0972;&#0962; (II., i. 402, and in ten other passages); &#0960;&#0959;&#0955;&#0965;&#0948;&#0949;&#0953;&#0961;&#0940;&#0962; (Il., i. 499; v. 754; viii. 3); and &#0960;&#0959;&#0955;&#8059;&#0960;&#0964;&#0965;&#0967;&#0959;&#0962; (Il., viii. 411; xx. 5). This last description, "the Olympos <i>of many layers, or thicknesses</i>," is peculiarly expressive. Instead of signifying the "ridges" of a mountain or range of mountains, as Geddes and so many before him have affirmed, it</p>

<p>pictures that world-old conception of a firmament, not single-storied, but with heaven above heaven, to the "third," or the "seventh," or the "ninth." These heavens were conceived of by Homer himself as in layers one above another, like the curved <i>lamin&aelig;</i> (&#0960;&#0964;&#0965;&#0967;&#0945;&#8054;) of a shield.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_590"></A><A HREF="#fn_590"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> And what adds to the fitness of the comparison and to the fitness of the cosmic adornment of Achilles&#146; shield is the fact that to the <i>omphalos</i> of a shield there corresponded the central and ever-abiding <i>Omphalos</i> of the Skies.</p>  
<p>5. Finally, our larger and more rational interpretation of Homeric ideas beautifully explains "the tall Pillars of Atlas," and solves the multiform perplexities of the ruling authorities on this question.</p>  
<p>In approaching the study of this subject several questions occur to every thoughtful beginner, the answers to which he can nowhere find. For instance: How can Homer speak of the Pillars of Atlas, using the plural, when elsewhere in the early Greek mythology the representations always point to only one? Again, if there is but one, and that in the West, near the Gardens of the Hesperides,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_591"></A><A HREF="#fn_591"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> what corresponding supports sustain the sky in the East, the North, and the South? Or, if Atlas's Pillar</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_351"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 351</FONT></A></p>  
<p>is only one of many similar ones supporting heaven around its whole periphery, how came it to be so much more famous than the rest? Or, if Homer's plural indicates that all of them belonged to Atlas, how came the idea of one Pillar to be so universally prevalent? If the support of heaven was at many points, and at its outermost rim, how could Hesiod venture to represent the whole vault as poised on Atlas's head and hands?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_592"></A><A HREF="#fn_592"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Again, if it is the special function of Atlas, or of his Pillar, to stand on the solid earth and hold up the sky, he would appear to have no special connection with the sea: why, then, should Homer introduce the strange statement that Atlas "knows all the depths of the sea"? This certainly seems very mysterious. Again, if the office of the Pillar or Pillars is to prop up the sky, they of course sustain different relations to earth and heaven. They bear up the one, and are themselves borne up by the other. Yet, singularly enough, Homer's <i>locus classicus</i> places them in exactly the same relation to the two.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_593"></A><A HREF="#fn_593"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Worse than this, Pausanias unqualifiedly and repeatedly asserts that, according to the myth, Atlas supports upon his shoulders "both earth and heaven."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_594"></A><A HREF="#fn_594"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> And with this corresponds</p>

<p>the language of &AElig;schylus.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_595"></A><A HREF="#fn_595"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> But what sort of a poetic imagination is this which represents a mighty column as upholding not only a vast super-incumbent weight, but also, and at the same time, its own pedestal? Is this a specimen creation of that immortal Hellenic genius, which the whole modern world is taught almost to adore?</p>  
<p>Turning to the authorities in textual and mythological interpretation, our beginner finds no help. On the contrary, their wild guesses and mutual contradictions only confuse him more and more. V&ouml;lcker tells him, with all the assuring emphasis of leaded type, that "in Atlas is given a personification of the art of navigation, the conquest of the sea by means of human skill, by commerce, and the gains of commerce."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_596"></A><A HREF="#fn_596"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Preller instructs him to reject this view, and to think of this mysterious son of Iapetos as a "sea-giant representing the upbearing and supporting almightiness of the ocean in contrast with the earth-shattering might of Poseidon."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_597"></A><A HREF="#fn_597"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> The classical dictionaries only perplex him with multitudinous puerilities invented by ignorant Euhemeristic scholiasts,&#151;stories to the effect that the original Atlas was merely the astronomer who first constructed an artificial globe to represent the sky; or that he was a Northwest African, who, having ascended a lofty promontory the better to observe the heavenly bodies, fell off into the sea, and so gave</p>

<p>name both to the mountain and to the Atlantic Ocean. Schoemann does not profess a positive and certain understanding of the matter, but suggests that the mysterious Titan was in all probability "originally a gigantic mountain-god" of some sort.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_598"></A><A HREF="#fn_598"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Bryant at first makes Atlas a mountain supporting a temple or temple-cave, called <i>Co-el</i>, house of God, whence "the C&#156;lus of the Romans," vol. i., p. 274. In the next volume, however, he says that "under the name of Atlas is meant the Atlantians." And quoting the Odyssey, he translates thus: "<i>They</i> [the Atlantians] <i>had also long Pillars, or obelisks, which referred to the sea, and upon which was delineated the whole system both of heaven and earth;</i> &#7936;&#0956;&#0960;&#8054;&#0962;, <i>all around, both on the front of the obelisk and on the other sides</i>."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_599"></A><A HREF="#fn_599"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>If our investigator asks, as did an ancient grammarian, how Atlas could stand on the earth and support heaven on his head, if heaven was so far removed that an anvil would require nine days and nights in which to fall through the distance, Paley kindly explains that "the poet's notion doubtless was that Atlas held up the sky near its junction with earth in the far West."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_600"></A><A HREF="#fn_600"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> In this case, of course, a reasonably short giant would answer the purpose. If, after all his consultations of authorities, our youth is still unsatisfied, and to make a last effort for light turns to the illustrious Welcker, he learns as an important</p>

<p><A NAME="page_354"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 354</FONT></A></p>  
<p>final lesson that when an ancient author says "heaven and earth," it is not for a moment to be supposed that he literally means "heaven and earth," and that, if they had remembered this, writers on mythology would have spared themselves "a vast amount of brain-racking and ineffectual <i>pro</i>-and-<i>contra</i> pleading."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_601"></A><A HREF="#fn_601"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> With this as the sole outcome of all his researches, may not a beginner well despair of ever getting any knowledge of the meaning of the myth, if, indeed, he can still imagine it to have had a meaning?</p>  
<p>Here, as everywhere, the truth at once explains and removes all the difficulties which a false and groundless presupposition has created.</p>  
<p>Once conceive of the Homeric world as we have reconstructed it, and how clear and beautiful the conception of the Pillars of Atlas becomes! They are simply the upright axes of earth and heaven. Viewed in their relation to earth and heaven respectively, they are two; but viewed in reference to the universe as an undivided whole, they are one and the same. Being coincident, they are truly one, and yet they are ideally separable. Hence singular or plural designations are equally correct and equally fitting. Transpiercing the globe at the very "navel or centre of the sea," Atlas's Pillar penetrates far deeper than any recess of the waters&#146; bed, and he may well be said to "know the depths of the whole sea." Or this statement may have reference to that primordial</p>

<p>Again, the association of Atlas with the Gardens of the Hesperides, so far from disproving our interpretation, actually affords new confirmation, since &AElig;schylus, Pherecydes, and the oldest traditions locate the Hesperides themselves, not in the West, but in the extreme North, beyond the Rhiph&aelig;an Mountains, in the vicinity of the Hyperboreans.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_603"></A><A HREF="#fn_603"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> In fact, there are very strong reasons for believing that these Gardens of the Hesperides were nothing other than the starry gardens of the circumpolar sky; that therefore the Hesperides were called the "Daughters of Night," and that the great serpent</p>

<p>Once more, our interpretation perfectly harmonizes the passages which represent Atlas as a heaven-supporter with those which represent him as equally supporting earth. More than this, it reveals the curious fact that Homer's description of the tall Pillars of Atlas identifies them with the axes of earth and heaven so unmistakably that, in order to blunder into the common mistranslation of it, it was first necessary to invent, and get the lexicographers to adopt, a span-new special meaning for the words &#7936;&#0956;&#0966;&#8054;&#0962; &#7956;&#0967;&#0949;&#0953;&#0957;&#151;a meaning necessitated by no other passage in the whole body of Homeric Greek.

Of Sandalfon, Rabbi Eliezer has said, "There is an angel who standeth on earth, and reacheth with his head to the door of heaven.

<p>In the foregoing discussions of Homeric cosmology we have had a sufficient exhibition of the cause and cure of current&#151;malpractice shall we call it?&#151;on the part of interpreters of Homeric poetry. Their baseless assumptions and blunders have been renewed and multiplied in nearly every field of arch&aelig;ology,&#151;Assyrian, Egyptian, Hebrew, Persian, Indian. Whithersoever "modern research" has gone it has carried with it, as a kind of first principle and rule of interpretation, the assumption that the early nations cannot possibly have known anything about the world, beyond what undeveloped tribes and peoples</p>

<p>would of necessity observe within their own contracted boundaries. The inconsistencies of ignorance and of half-knowledge and of an undisciplined, "child-like" imagination are therefore to be expected at every step. Even the squarest contradictions must not surprise. Indeed, in respect to Homer, the learned Sengebusch has actually formulated the universal proposition that the results of investigations in different departments of Homeric study "will <i>always</i> be found to contradict each other."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_614"></A><A HREF="#fn_614"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> In view of the accepted modern results of investigation into Homer's cosmology one is tempted to justify the proposition, only qualifying it in a mild degree, as follows: The results of all Homeric investigations based upon the assumption that Homer was too "primitive" a man to know where the sun sets will always be found self-contradictory.</p>  
<p>Against all such barbarizing misinterpretation of ancient literature it is high time that a protest should be heard. Long enough has the beauty and the breadth of ancient thought, in poetry and myth and even in word-building, been obscured and hidden by this conceited assumption of the modern teacher. It was bad enough when the old grammarians, assuming that Homer could have had no idea of other than the nearest waters, mutilated the grand proportions of the Odyssey to fit the voyagings of its hero into the western basin of the Mediterranean, or, worse yet, into the Euxine.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_615"></A><A HREF="#fn_615"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> But this, after all, was an altogether pardonable offense</p>

<p>compared with the currently accepted procedure of scholars, who, brought up apparently on magazines of popular science, and imagining that Columbus was the first man to whom the idea ever occurred that the earth is round, approach the study of antiquity merely as the study of an older department of barbarian folk-lore. Surely it is time to investigate the great creations of ancient mind in a different spirit.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_616"></A><A HREF="#fn_616"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> It is nothing short of deplorable to consider the mass of senseless argument and false explanation annually crowded into the memories of successive classes of academic and collegiate youth,&#151;arguments and explanations which neither to teacher nor taught have even the poor merit of intelligently illustrating the evils of wrong principles of classical hermeneutics. The discussions and results of the present treatise have at least disclosed a conceivable beginning of human history, according to which the early generations of men can hardly have failed to acquire that knowledge of the mechanism of the heavens which all the oldest traditions of the race ascribe to them.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_617"></A><A HREF="#fn_617"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> And if, in consequence of the</p>

Professor Blackie's reasoning is entirely subjective: "In a spiritual religion, like Christianity, the word heaven will always be kept as vague as possible; in an imaginative and sensuous religion, like the Greek, it must be localized. A Zeus with human shape and members must sit on a terrestrial seat; and the only seat proper for him is the highest mountain in the country to which he belongs. Now, as the original seat of the Greeks, when they rested from their long journey by the Caspian and Euxine westward, was the plains of Macedonia and Thessaly, the necessary locality for the throne of the Supreme God and the council of the Immortals was Olympos, the extreme east end of the long Cambunian range separating Thessaly from Macedonia, to the north of the Peneios and the defile of Tempe." <i>Homer and the Iliad</i>.

To place Ossa upon Olympos, then upon Ossa Pelion, in order, by means of the three, to climb up into an abode situated on the top of the undermost of the three, is the problem! No wonder that V&ouml;lcker thinks Homer has been overpraised for his knowledge of localities and of the arrangement of mountains: "Der Olymp muss auf jeden Fall zu unterst kommen, und die Folgerung aus dieser Stelle f&uuml;r die Homerische Localkenntniss und Grundlage der Wirklichkeit in Anordnung der Berge m&uuml;ssen wir dahin gestellt sein lassen." <i>Hom.

<P><A NAME="fn_576"></A><A HREF="pf34.htm#fr_576">344:2</A> Thus V&ouml;lcker, after reminding the reader that "there can be no doubt that the gods are here represented as on Olympos, and not where Hera hung &#7952;&#0957; &#0945;&#7984;&#0952;&#8051;&#0961;&#0953; &#0954;&#0945;&#8054; &#0957;&#0949;&#0966;&#0943;&#0955;&#8131;&#0963;&#0953;&#0957;," exclaims very naturally, "Where now is the end of the rope made fast?" He immediately adds as his answer, "Ohne Zweifel &#0960;&#0949;&#0961;&#8054; &#8165;&#0943;&#0959;&#0957; &#0927;&#8016;&#0955;&#8059;&#0956;&#0960;&#0959;&#0953;&#0959;!&#151;Without doubt around the peak of Olympos!" No wonder he places an exclamation point after such a masterpiece of interpretation. Possibly the French savant, M. Boivin, who to explain <i>Od</i>., vi. 40 ff., contended that Homer conceived of Olympos as an <i>inverted</i> mountain, having its snowy top near the earth and its snowless and rainless roots in heaven, caught his idea from V&ouml;lcker's exegesis of this passage!</P>

He says, "The manner in which this &#8165;&#0943;&#0959;&#0957; &#0927;&#8016;&#0955;&#8059;&#0956;&#0960;&#0959;&#0953;&#0959; is referred to in a concrete form shows that it was not only a visible but [also a] commanding object in the poet's landscape; so much so that it <i>embarrasses his physical speculations and conceptions of the Cosmos</i> [<i>sic</i>], since it is made the pinnacle on which the world of sea and land is to be suspended by the golden chain.

The use of &#7936;&#0947;&#0940;&#0957;&#0957;&#0953;&#0959;&#0966;&#0959;&#0962; no more necessitates a literal interpretation than does a poet's application of the term "snowy" to a living bosom, or "fleecy" to the clouds.

Moreover, Aristotle, or whoever wrote the "Letter of Aristotle to Alexander on the System of the World," in one passage expressly identifies <i>Ouranos</i> and <i>Olympos</i>, saying that for diverse etymological reasons we call the outermost circumference of heaven by both names. See Flammarion, <i>Astronomical Myths, or History of the Heavens</i>, p. 156. Even V&ouml;lcker, in first laying down the thesis which has so misled all his successors ("dass Uranus and Olympus nie als synonym bei Homer gebraucht werden"), frankly confesses that this is "gegen die bisher allgemein gehegte Meinung;" that is, "contrary to the opinion hitherto generally held." <i>Homerische Geog.</i>, p. 4.

If this year was in use before the Deluge, it appears very probable, it must be confessed, that the patriarchs were already acquainted to a considerable degree of accuracy with the motions of the stars, for this lunar month agrees to a second, almost, with that which has been determined by modern astronomers."&#151;Flammarion, <i>Astronomical Myths</i>.
