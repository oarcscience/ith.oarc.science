<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Where</span> does Homer locate the realm of Hades?</p>  
<p>In the whole broad field of Homeric scholarship it would be difficult to find a more fascinating question. Few have been more written upon. The literature of the subject is itself almost a library. No mythologist, no commentator upon the poet, no class-room interpreter even, can evade the question; and yet, in their answers, the Homeric authorities of all modern times, whatever their nationality, present only a pitiable spectacle of helpless bewilderment. Classifying these various interpreters according to the answers they respectively give to the question propounded, they stand as follows:&#151;</p>  
<p>First, a class who content themselves with the general assertion that the earth of Homer was a "flat disk," and that his Hades, like that of the ancients generally, was undoubtedly conceived of as a dark recess or cavern in the bosom of this earth-disk. Anything in the Odyssey</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_468"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 468</FONT></A></p>  
<p>or elsewhere inconsistent with this view is simply a play of poetic fancy.</p>  
<p>Second, a class&#151;if class it be&#151;who say with the genial Wilhelm Jordan, "Das Hadesreich der Odyssee ist die von der Sonne abgekehrte R&uuml;ckseite der Erdscheibe, die &#7936;&#0957;&#0964;&#0943;&#0967;&#0952;&#0959;&#0957;, Gegenerde, eines weit sp&auml;teren Zeitalters. Von der &#0950;&#0949;&#0943;&#0948;&#0969;&#0961;&#0959;&#0962; &#7940;&#0961;&#0959;&#0965;&#0961;&#0945; und vom G&ouml;tterhimmel aus betrachtet bleibt es allerdings Unterwelt, &#8016;&#0960;&#8056; &#0954;&#0949;&#8059;&#0952;&#0949;&#0963;&#0953; &#0947;&#0945;&#0943;&#0945;&#0962;, aber nicht als Erdinneres, sondern als jenseitige Oberfl&auml;che."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_676"></A><A HREF="#fn_676"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Here the earth is still a flat disk; but Hades, instead of being within it, is simply its under or reverse side.</p>  
<p>Third, a class who locate the shadowy realm on the same plane with the inhabited earth, but in the far West, just <i>inside</i> the Ocean-stream. This includes all commentators who, locating Hades above ground in the West, place Kirk&egrave;'s isle in the same quarter, and hold that Odysseus did not cross over the Ocean-stream.</p>  
<p>Fourth, a class who locate it in the far West, just <i>outside</i> the Ocean-stream. This includes all commentators who, locating Hades above ground in the West, place Kirk&egrave;'s isle in the same quarter, but hold that Odysseus crossed the Ocean-stream.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_677"></A><A HREF="#fn_677"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_469"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 469</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Fifth, a class who locate it in the far East, just inside the Ocean-stream. This class includes all who place Kirk&egrave;'s isle in the East, and hold that Odysseus did not cross the Ocean-stream in visiting the superterranean Hades.</p>  
<p>Sixth, a class who locate it in the far East, just outside the Ocean-stream. This includes all who place Kirk&egrave;'s isle in the East, and hold that Odysseus crossed the Ocean-stream in visiting the superterranean Hades.</p>  
<p>Seventh, a class who try to harmonize the conflicting representations by making the one set of expressions relate to a Hades in the bosom of the flat earth, and the other set of expressions relate to "the entrance" of the passage leading down to it from the world of living men. This class is again subdivided into four sub-classes, according as they maintain a <i>cis-oceanic</i> or <i>trans-oceanic</i> location of this mouth of Hades, and place it to the <i>East</i> or to the <i>West</i> of the poet.</p>  
<p>Eighth, a class who hold that the difficulty is in the poet himself, he having got two incompatible mythologies mixed up together.</p>  
<p>Ninth, a class who try to solve all discrepancies by assigning the different representations in the two poems, and in different parts of the same poem, to different ages and to different authors.</p>  
<p>Tenth, a class who query whether or no it be not admissible to hold that Homer had two realms of Hades,&#151;the one "subterranean," and the other "beyond the Ocean."</p>  
<p>Eleventh, a class who, with Altenburg and Gerland, resolve the whole story of Odysseus&#146; descent to Hades into an astronomical myth;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_678"></A><A HREF="#fn_678"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> or with Cox see in it simply a mythologico-poetic expression for the prosaic fact that the Sun, the "lord of day," returning after his morning</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_470"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 470</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and noontide wanderings to his western home, sometimes finds it necessary to make his way behind dark clouds.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_679"></A><A HREF="#fn_679"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Twelfth, a class who point out the manifest difficulties of the problem, but frankly profess their utter inability to present a solution.</p>  
<p>Of the more important of the maps of "the world according to Homer," those of Bunbury, V&ouml;lcker, and Forbiger are constructed according to the view of class fourth; that of Ukert, according to the view of that division of class seventh who locate the Hades portal in the far West, just inside the Ocean-stream; that of Gladstone,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_680"></A><A HREF="#fn_680"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> according to the view of that division of class seventh who locate the Hades portal in the far East, just inside the Ocean-stream. V&ouml;lcker, however, is inclined to believe in two Homeric Hades-realms,&#151;the one interterranean, the other at the West superterranean and trans-oceanic.</p>  
<p>Such are the multifarious, contradictory, confused, and despairing answers given to our question by the most learned and eminent of Homeric scholars. It would be an easy task to fill a volume with citations illustrating these various positions, and the ingenious but mutually destructive arguments by which their respective advocates have sought to establish them. It will be more profitable to turn from such a Babel of ideas, over which the darkness of Hades itself seems to have fallen, and inquire what the poet himself has to say on the subject.</p>  
<p>The region of the dead is represented in Homer as one of perpetual night. Its name is Erebos.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_681"></A><A HREF="#fn_681"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> From the</p>

<p>name of the divinity presiding in it, it is generally called the house or abode of Aides (Hades).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_682"></A><A HREF="#fn_682"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> That it was conceived of as <i>underneath the earth</i> appears from the perpetually recurring expressions, both in the Iliad and in the Odyssey, relating the descent into and ascent out of it.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_683"></A><A HREF="#fn_683"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> In certain passages it is in fact expressly spoken of as "under the earth; "&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_684"></A><A HREF="#fn_684"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in others, as "under the recesses of the earth."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_685"></A><A HREF="#fn_685"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Hence A&iuml;des himself is styled &#0918;&#0949;&#8058;&#0962; &#0954;&#0945;&#0964;&#0945;&#0967;&#0952;&#0972;&#0957;&#0953;&#0959;&#0962;, "the Subterranean Zeus."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_686"></A><A HREF="#fn_686"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>In the Battle of the Gods there is a vivid picture of this underworld and of its trembling king:&#151;</p>

<p><small>Thus the blessed gods inciting, both sides engaged, and among them made severe contention to break out. But dreadfully from above thundered the Father of gods and men, while beneath Poseidon shook the boundless earth and the lofty summits of the mountains. The roots and all the summits of many-rilled Ida were shaken, and the city of the Trojans and the ships of the Greeks. A&iuml;des himself, king of the nether world, trembled beneath, and leaped up from his throne terrified, and shouted aloud, lest earth-shaking Poseidon should cleave asunder the earth over him, and disclose to mortals and immortals his mansions, terrible, squalid, which even the gods loathe.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_687"></A><A HREF="#fn_687"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></small></p>  
<p>But while the abode of A&iuml;des is thus clearly represented as under the earth, it is nevertheless represented as just across the Ocean-river, and capable of being reached by ship. In the eleventh and twelfth books of the Odyssey, the voyage of Odysseus to this region is described in the same apparently literal nautical terms as is the voyage to the Land of the Lotus-Eaters. And of his interview with the dead, Hayman says, "The whole scene is conceived by the poet as enacted on a geographical extension of the earth beyond the Ocean-stream."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_688"></A><A HREF="#fn_688"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> There is no hint of any descent into the interior of the earth, no passage through or into subterranean caverns. The journey is as natural in all its aspects as any voyage from one coast of the Atlantic to its opposite.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_689"></A><A HREF="#fn_689"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Thus opens the eleventh book:&#151;</p>

<p><small>But when we were come down to the ship and the sea, we first of all drew the ship into the divine sea, and we placed a mast and sails in the black ship. And taking the sheep we put them on board, and we ourselves also embarked grieving, shedding the warm tear. And fair-haired Kirk&egrave; (Circe)&#151;an awful goddess, possessing human speech&#151;sent behind our dark-blue-prowed ship a moist wind that filled the sails, an excellent companion. And we sat down, making use of each of the instruments in the ship, and the wind and the pilot directed it. And the sails of it passing over the sea were stretched out the whole day; and the sun set, and all the ways were overshadowed. And it reached the extreme boundaries of the deep-flowing Ocean,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_690"></A><A HREF="#fn_690"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> where are the people and city of the Kimmerians covered with shadow and vapor, nor does the shining sun behold them with his beams, neither when he goes toward the starry heaven, nor when he turns back again from heaven to earth, but pernicious night is spread over hapless mortals. Having come there we drew up our ship, and we took out the sheep, and we ourselves went again to the stream of the Ocean, until we came to the place which Kirk&egrave; mentioned.</small></p>  
<p>Here the hero performed the rites and held the consultation which Kirk&egrave; had previously prescribed in these terms:&#151;</p>  
<p><small>"O noble son of Laertes, much-contriving Odysseus, do not remain any longer in my house against your will. But first you must perform another voyage, and come to the house of A&iuml;des and awful Persephon&egrave;, to consult the soul of Theban Tiresias, a blind prophet, whose mind is firm. To him, even when dead, Persephon&egrave; has given understanding, alone to be prudent, but the rest flit about as shades."</p>  
<p>"Who, O Kirk&egrave;, will conduct me on this voyage? No one has yet come to A&iuml;des in a black ship."</p>  
<p>"O noble son of Laertes, much-contriving Odysseus, let not the desire of a guide for thy ship be at all a care to thee; but having erected the mast, and spread out the white sails, sit down, and let the blast of the North wind carry it. But when thou shalt have passed through the Ocean in thy ship, where</small></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_474"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 474</FONT></A></p>  
<p><small>is the easy-dug&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_691"></A><A HREF="#fn_691"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> shore and the groves of Persephon&egrave;, and tall poplars, and fruit-destroying willows, there draw up thy ship in the deep-eddying Ocean, and do thou thyself go to the spacious house of A&iuml;des. Here indeed both Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus, which is a stream from the water of Styx, flow into Acheron; and there is a rock, and the meeting of two loud-sounding rivers. There then, O hero, approaching near as I; command thee, dig a trench the width of a cubit each way; and pour around it libations to all the dead, first with mixed , honey, then with sweet wine, and again the third time with water, and sprinkle white meal over it. And entreat much the powerless heads of the dead, promising that when thou comest to Ithaca thou wilt offer up in thy palace a barren heifer, whichsoever is the best, and wilt fill the pyre with excellent things, and that thou wilt sacrifice to Tiresias alone a black sheep, all black, which excels among thy sheep. But when thou shalt have entreated the illustrious nations of the dead with prayers, then sacrifice a male sheep and a black female, turning toward Erebos; and do thou thyself be turned away at a distance, going toward the streams of the river; but there many souls of those gone dead will come. Then immediately exhort thy companions and command them, having skinned the sheep which lie there slain with the unpitying brass, to burn them and to invoke the gods, both mighty A&iuml;des and dread Persephon&egrave;. And do thou, having drawn thy sharp sword from thy thigh, sit down, nor suffer the powerless heads of the dead to go near the blood before thou inquirest of Tiresias. Then the prophet will immediately come to thee, O leader of the people, who will tell to thee the voyage and the measures of the way and thy return, how thou mayest go over the fishy sea."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_692"></A><A HREF="#fn_692"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></small></p>  
<p>In the following passage Odysseus narrates how, having arrived "at the place which Kirk&egrave; mentioned," he fulfilled her commission:&#151;</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_475"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 475</FONT></A></p>  
<p><small>Then Perimedes and Eurylochos made sacred offerings; but I, drawing my sharp sword from my thigh, dug a trench the width of a cubit each way, and around it we poured libations to all the dead, first with mixed honey, then with sweet wine, again a third time with water, and I sprinkled white meal over it. And I much besought the unsubstantial heads of the dead, promising that when I came to Ithaca I would offer up in my palace a barren heifer, whichsoever is the best, and that I would sacrifice separately to Tiresias alone a sheep all black. which excels among our sheep. But when I had besought them, the nations of the dead, with vows and prayers, then taking the sheep, I cut off their heads into the trench, and the black blood flowed; and the souls of the perished dead were assembled forth from Erebos,&#151;betrothed girls and youths, and much-enduring old men, and tender virgins having a newly grieved mind, and many Mars-renowned men wounded with brass-tipped spears, possessing gore-besmeared arms, who in great numbers were wandering about the trench on different sides with a divine clamor; and pale fear seized upon me. Then at length exhorting my companions, I commanded them, having skinned the sheep which lay there, slain with the cruel brass, to burn them, and to invoke the gods, both A&iuml;des and Persephon&egrave;. But I, having drawn my sharp sword from my thigh, sat down; nor did I suffer the powerless heads of the dead to draw nigh the blood, before I inquired of Tiresias.</small></p>  
<p>So far it might appear uncertain whether the hero were really in Hades, or only near it, at some point accessible alike to the living and to the dead. But the lines immediately following show that he was truly in "the house of A&iuml;des:"&#151;</p>  
<p><small>And first the soul of my companion Elpenor came, for he was not yet buried beneath the wide-wayed earth; for we left his body in the palace of Kirk&egrave;, unwept-for and unburied, since another toil then urged us. Beholding him I wept, and pitied him in my mind; and, addressing him, spoke winged words: "O Elpenor, how didst thou come under the dark west? Thou hast come sooner on foot than I with a black ship."</small></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_476"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 476</FONT></A></p>  
<p><small>Thus I spoke, but he groaning answered me in discourse: "O Zeus-born son of Laertes, much-contriving Odysseus, the evil destiny of the deity and the abundant wine hurt me. Lying down in the palace of Kirk&egrave;, I did not think to go down backward, having come to the long ladder; but I fell downward from the roof, and my neck was broken from the vertebr&aelig;, and my soul descended to Hades."</small></p>  
<p>In line 69, Elpenor speaks of Odysseus "going <i>hence from the house of A&iuml;des;</i>" and in line 164, as elsewhere (x. 502; xi. 59, 158; Xii. 21; xxiii. 324), the expressions leave no chance to doubt that Odysseus&#146; voyage was a genuine <i>descensus ad inferos</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_693"></A><A HREF="#fn_693"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Here, then, are the two grand tests of every proposed solution of the problem of the location of the Homeric Hades:&#151;</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">I. <i>Its Hades must be underneath the earth;</i> and</p>  
<p>II. <i>It must be on the surface of the earth, beyond the Ocean</i>.</div></p>  
<p>This strange and perplexing difference, not to say contradiction, in the Homeric representations, did not escape the notice of the older commentators and writers on mythology. Especially has it called out the ingenuity of German scholars. F. A. Wolf recognized it, but did not profess to be able to give an explanation. J. H. Voss invented the method of solving the problem by placing Hades itself within the bosom of the earth-disk, but its "entrance" on the westernmost point of Europe on the inner shore of the ocean. V&ouml;lcker rejected this solution, but, in the absence of a better, cautiously suggested&#151;as we have seen&#151;the possibility of Homer's having held to two kingdoms of the dead, one within the earth, and one</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_477"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 477</FONT></A></p>  
<p>in the dark trans-oceanic West.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_694"></A><A HREF="#fn_694"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Eggers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_695"></A><A HREF="#fn_695"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and Nitzsch&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_696"></A><A HREF="#fn_696"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> inclined to the support of the Vossian compromise; and in 1854 Preller could still speak of it as the one "at present chiefly prevalent."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_697"></A><A HREF="#fn_697"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Still, as Preller and others urged, nothing in the descriptions of the western Hades corresponds with the idea of a "portal" or "entrance" to a subterranean world extending so far eastward as to be situated under Greece and Asia Minor:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_698"></A><A HREF="#fn_698"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> hence the latest interpreters have been as free as were the earlier to take their choice among the wild and contradictory conjectures classified at the beginning of this paper. The latest of these guesses is that of Jordan; and, though it comes within a hair's-breadth of the truth, it has been the most ridiculed of all.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_699"></A><A HREF="#fn_699"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center">_________________________</p>  
<p>As pointed out in earlier pages, the one false principle which has vitiated and confused all modern discussions of Homeric cosmology is the groundless notion that the earth of Homer is a flat disk. This mistaken presupposition is responsible for the failure of all hitherto attempted demonstrations of the true location of the poet's Hades. Once conceive of the Homeric Cosmos as represented</p>

<p>in the accompanying cut of the "World of Homer," and the problem of the site of Hades is solved at a glance. It is the southern or under hemisphere of the upright spherical earth. In this conception, whatsoever is "trans-oceanic" is also and of necessity "subterranean." Now for the first time can it be understood how Leda and her noble-minded sons can be "on a geographical extension of the earth" on the farther shore of the Ocean, and at the same time &#0957;&#8051;&#0961;&#0952;&#0949;&#0957; &#0947;&#8134;&#0962; (Od., xi. 298). In this Cosmos, Hades cannot be beyond the Ocean without being also underneath the earth. On the traditional theory of a flat earth, the passage is and ever must be the palpable inconsistency which V&ouml;lcker represents it. Even the theory of two or of twenty Homers does not reasonably explain it. Precisely so with the passages relating to Elpenor. His soul at death goes &#0954;&#0945;&#0964;&#8048; &#0967;&#0952;&#0959;&#0957;&#0972;&#0962;, yet it is found with the other ghosts in the shadowy land just across the Ocean-river. So again with the passages relating to the shades of the slain Suitors. These reach the Underworld (xxiv. 106, 203); but it is by a route <i>along the surface of the ground</i> to the Ocean-stream, in full sight of the gates of the sun and of the stars of the Milky Way (xxiv. 9-12).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_700"></A><A HREF="#fn_700"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Illustrious scholars have accused the poet of <i>Widerspr&uuml;che gr&ouml;ber and &auml;rger</i> than usual in this account;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_701"></A><A HREF="#fn_701"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> but the whole trouble has been, not in the poet, but in the poet's interpreters. With the spherical earth, all is consistent and precisely as it should be. In this reconstructed Homeric Cosmos, every crosser of the Ocean-stream, whether it be Hermes, or Odysseus, or Herakles, reaches the groves of Persephon&egrave; and the house of A&iuml;des. Wherever Kirk&egrave;'s isle is located, the "blast of the North wind" will drive the voyager thence towards the realms of the dead. In like manner it can now be understood how the stolen</p>

<p>and the fishy sea.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_702"></A><A HREF="#fn_702"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Though the god has power to penetrate the solid sphere,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_703"></A><A HREF="#fn_703"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> it is down no yawning chasm that his chariot disappears.

Beautifully exact and strikingly natural is now the poet's declaration that Tartaros is "as far below Hades as earth from heaven,"&#151;a declaration as fatal to many of the fifteen or more traditional explanations of Homer's Hades as it is to Flach's elaborate and ingenious diagram of the Hades of Hesiod.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_705"></A><A HREF="#fn_705"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> With this inverted hemisphere for the kingdom of the dead, Voss need not longer trouble himself about the mention of "clouds" therein.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_706"></A><A HREF="#fn_706"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> In fine, with the correct Homeric conception of the earth and of Hades, the manifold alleged contradictions of the poet instantaneously vanish.

<p>of Hades, which have so long perplexed and blurred the vision of Homeric interpreters, suddenly resolve themselves into one perfectly focused stereoscopic picture of startling vividness and beauty.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>One ground of misgiving and doubt may possibly still occur to cautious minds. "Is it credible," it may be asked, "that the early Homeric Greek, unschooled in the exercise of the scientific imagination, could picture to himself that pendant under-surface of the earth as habitable even by ghosts? Could he so long before 'Newton's day' have gained such knowledge of gravitation as to see how infernal rivers and infernal palaces could cling to an under-hemisphere? That Aristotle and the Greek philosophers of his age were able, we know from their writings;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_707"></A><A HREF="#fn_707"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> but is it credible that the Greek of the Homeric age was equal to such a task? This proposed conception of Hades requires that we should think of a world where everything is upside down, exactly contrary and antipodal to our own. Can we believe that 'prehistoric men' could achieve such a prodigy of abstract thought?"</p>  
<p>A pertinent and perhaps sufficient answer to these questions might be given by pointing to a most curious and instructive funeral-custom among the modern Karens of Burmah. This tribe is certainly not more highly gifted or more highly civilized than were the Greeks of the heroic age, yet they have precisely this Homeric conception of an antipodal Hades. A most competent authority gives us the following account: "When the day of burial arrives, and the body is carried to the grave, four bamboo splints are taken, and one is thrown towards the West, saying, 'That is the East;' another is thrown to the East, saying, 'That is the West;' a third is thrown upwards towards the top of the tree, saying, 'That is the foot of the tree;' and a fourth is thrown downwards, saying,</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> 'That is the top of the tree.' The sources of the stream are pointed to, saying, 'That is the mouth of the stream;' and the mouth of the stream is pointed to, saying, 'That is the head of the stream.' <i>This is done because in Hades everything is upside down in relation to the things of this world</i>."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_708"></A><A HREF="#fn_708"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Striking, however, as would be this answer to the questioner, a better can be given. The better one points out to him the foolishness of the assumption that either the Greeks or the Karens originated for themselves their conceptions of Hades. Both simply inherited from their fathers the old pre-Hellenic Asiatic idea of an antipodal Underworld. Ages ago the notion which underlies the Karen's rites was so prominent in the mind of the East Aryans that the sudden and inevitable reversal of the points of the compass, consequent upon entering the Underworld, became a poetic circumlocution to express the idea of dying: thus, "Before thou art carried away dead to the Ender by the royal command of Yama, . . . <i>before the four quarters of the sky whirl round</i>, . . . practice the most perfect contemplation."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_709"></A><A HREF="#fn_709"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Ages ago the notion which underlies the southward voyage of Odysseus led prehistoric Akkadians, in naming the cardinal points of the compass, to designate the South as "the <i>funereal</i> point;" and in locating the kingdom of the dead, to place</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>About a thousand years before Abraham went down into Egypt,&#151;at least, that is the date assigned by Egyptologists,&#151;a scribe engrossed upon a papyrus a fair copy of a tale of shipwreck. It is now one of the treasures of St. Petersburg. At the Congress of Orientalists, held in Berlin in the year 1881, its existence was first made known to the modern world through the translation then submitted by M. Gol&eacute;nischeff. The tale proves to be a kind of anticipation of the voyage of Odysseus to the realm of A&iuml;des. As in the Odyssey, it is the ship-commander himself who narrates his adventures. There is no imaginative and poetic vagueness about the details. The ship was one hundred and fifty cubits long, forty broad. The crew consisted of one hundred and fifty men. Upon the Ocean he is wrecked, his crew lost; he himself, however, is driven upon an island in the neighborhood of the nether world of the dead. Indeed, the place itself was called "The Isle of the Double;" and it was, as Masp&eacute;ro believes, peopled by Shades invisible to the voyager only because he was as yet in the body. The king of the island was a huge serpent, thirty cubits long, and possessed of a wonderful beard.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_719"></A><A HREF="#fn_719"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

<p>Not in the West, where all our Egyptologists persist in locating Amenti, but <i>in the South</i>. Directly <i>up the Nile</i>, and out into the Ocean at its head-waters, lay the voyager's track. As in the case of Odysseus, so many centuries later, it was the blast of the North wind which bore him thither.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_720"></A><A HREF="#fn_720"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>

Here, and in some other writers, along with a retention of the unity of the authorship of the Iliad and Odyssey, we find an intimation that the perplexing discrepancy in Greek representations of Hades is due to a gradual translocation of it from the far West to the interior of the earth, in consequence of advancing geographical knowledge. Perhaps a separate class should have been introduced, consisting of the representatives of this view. But had this been done, yet a fourteenth class would have been necessary to include those who, with Charles Francis Keary, exactly reverse the process, and make the oldest Greek Hades interterranean, and the trans-oceanic one at the West a later product. <i>The Mythology of the Eddas</i>.

And as to Lenormant's location of the antipodal mountain of Hades in the West or South-west, our latest German writer upon the subject, Dr. Friedrich Delitzsch, an eminent Assyriologist, affirms that in the cuneiform literature thus far known he has discovered no trace of such a location. <i>Wo lag das Paradies?</i> Leipsic, 1881, p. 121.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_713"></A><A HREF="pf42.htm#fr_713">483:4</A> "Nach der pythagor&auml;ischen, orphischen und neuplatonischen Lehre brachte der Nordwind Leben der S&uuml;dwind Tod, wohnten hinter dem Nordwind die Seligen und die G&ouml;tter als Sch&ouml;pfer und Erhalter der Welt, hinter dem S&uuml;dwind aber die Verdammten und alle b&ouml;sen zerst&ouml;renden Urm&auml;chte." W. Menzel, <i>Die vorchristliche Unsterblichkeitslehre</i>, vol. ii., p. 101; also pp. 36, 168, 345, and <i>passim</i>. Compare A.

<P><A NAME="fn_714"></A><A HREF="pf42.htm#fr_714">484:1</A> For the first, see Brugsch, <i>Geographische Inschriften alt&auml;gyptischer Denkm&auml;ler</i>, Leipsic, 1858, Bd. ii., p. 57; for the second, <i>The Book of the Dead</i>, <i>passim</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_715"></A><A HREF="pf42.htm#fr_715">484:2</A> See Tiele, <i>History of the Egyptian Religion</i> (English edition, 1882), p. 68, "the reversed world;" and the still more forcible expression in his Histoire Compar&eacute;e (Paris, 1882), p. 47, "<i>le monde oppos&eacute; au monde actuel</i>." Compare <i>Book of the Dead</i> (Birch's version), where it is styled "the <i>inverted</i> precinct;" and Thompson's <i>Egyptian Doctrine of the Future State</i>, wherein Hades is described as "the inverted hemisphere of darkness," and where it is said to be "evident that the leading features of the Greek Hades were borrowed from Egypt." <i>Bibliotheca Sacra</i>, 1868, pp. 84, 86. Still more recently Reginald S. Poole has remarked, "Now that we recognize the Vedic source of a part of the Greek pantheon, and its generally Aryan character, we may fairly look elsewhere for that which is not Vedic. If embalming were derived from Egypt, why not the ideas which the Greek saw surrounding the custom,&#151;the pictures of the Underworld, with its judgment, its felicity, and its misery? The stories which Homer makes Odysseus tell, when he would disguise his identity, show the familiarity with Egypt of the Greeks of the poet's time." <i>The Contemporary Review</i>, London, 1881, July, p. 61. It would be better to say that Homer's Hades, while agreeing with the Egyptian and Babylonian and Vedic, was not necessarily "borrowed" from either of these peoples, but more likely agreed with the Egyptian, Babylonian, and Vedic, simply because in each case there was a common inheritance,&#151;a survival of still more ancient ideas of prehistoric ancestors.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_717"></A><A HREF="pf42.htm#fr_717">484:4</A> Tiele, <i>History of the Egyptian Religion</i>, p. 67: "The heaven (at night) rests upon the earth, like a goose brooding over her egg." Chabas, Lieblein, and Lef&eacute;vre have each maintained that the ancient Egyptians were acquainted with the spherical figure of the earth; while Masp&eacute;ro, despite his language in <i>Les Contes Populaires de l&#146;&Eacute;gypte Ancienne</i> (Paris, 1882, pp. lxi.-lxiii.), in a private letter of still more recent date admits the possibility that the Egyptians held to such a view as long ago as eighteen centuries before the Christian era. In this connection it may be useful to state that Professor <A NAME="page_485"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 485</FONT></A> Tiele informs the present writer that he has abandoned his conjecture touching <i>Cher-nuter</i>, expressed in his <i>Vergelijkende Geschiedenis van de Egyptische en Mesopotamische Godesdiensten</i>, Amsterdam, 1872, p. 94; French edition, 1882, p. 51; English edition, 1882, p. 72.</P>

The following is particularly timely: "While at Abydos I explored the mountain cliffs to the westward in the hope of finding early tombs in them. In this, however, I was disappointed, as I came across only a few tombs of the Roman period." Professor A. H. Sayce in letter from Egypt in <i>The Academy</i>, London, Feb. 2, 1884, p. 84.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_720"></A><A HREF="pf42.htm#fr_720">486:1</A> The universality of the ancient belief that disembodied souls must cross a body of water to reach their proper abode has attracted the attention of Mannhardt, and led him to remark, "Da auch die keltische, hellenische, iranische and indische Religion diese Vorstellung kennt, so ist es von vorn herein wahrscheinlich, dass dieselbe &uuml;ber die Zeit der Trennung hinausgeht." <i>Germanische Mythen</i>, Berlin, 1858, p. 364. This is a far more reasonable explanation than the fanciful attempt of Keary in the work already cited, and in his paper before the Royal Society of Literature entitled <i>Earthly Paradise of European Myths</i>.</P>

Notwithstanding this, Mr. Stuart, a few pages later,&#151;so powerful is the influence of tradition,&#151;alludes to Amenti as located in the West (p. 49, also p. 27).
