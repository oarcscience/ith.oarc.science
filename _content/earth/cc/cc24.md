# Levels, Plumbs, Appurtenances, and Records

INASMUCH as the Geodetic Survey was extended through space by means of
right angles, regardless of any other method of determination of a
straight line, and regardless of the consequences, it is obvious that it
was not extended by any leveling process.

By reference to cut No. 4, Plate 1, it will be seen that the rectiline
would vary from the water level in ever-increasing angles from the
beginning to the end of the line. If the earth were convex, the line at
the end of 4 miles would be higher than at the beginning, and the angles
would be divergent from the beginning; if concave, convergent from the
beginning. We used levels for two purposes: First, to level the first
section; second, to ascertain and record the variation of the sections
from the water horizontal at given points along the coast.

By reference to the "Comprehensive View of the Air Line" (diagram 4,
Plate 1), the reader will understand how the plumbline should hang with
reference to the right-angled bars, first, if the earth were convex;
second, if it were flat; and third, on the basis of the concavity.

The leveling of the first section was the point for the exercise and
application of the greatest skill and accuracy; the first section must
be accurately leveled. For this purpose we applied one of the finest and
most sensitive spirit levels obtainable. In connection with this we had
our 12-foot mercurial geodetic level, invented specially for this
survey. Being 12 feet in

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

length, it was susceptible of being used with great accuracy and
precision.

Applied to the first section, the spirit and mercurial levels agreed.
The plumb was also applied to the cross-arms of the first section as
additional corroboration. The horizon was also observed in relation to
the long straight-edge formed by a number of adjustments, and the
straight-edge was perfectly parallel with the clear-cut water line of
the Gulf of Mexico, viewed from a point three or four rods back of the
apparatus, so as to place the under edge of the straight-edge and the
water line in apparent contiguity.

The leveling was a careful, painstaking, and successful work, witnessed
by every member of the Staff, and finally pronounced perfect at 8:50 on
the morning of March 18, 1897. From thence the line was projected on the
basis of the principles which we have demonstrated.

A convenient chest was moved along the line as the work progressed, with
thermometer, microscope., calipers, rules, compass, spirit level,
triangles, pro-tractor, telescope, thumb bolts, adjusting gauges,
celluloid test card, etc., and the books of the Staff for the purpose of
making the most accurate observations and measurements, and recording
the same on the field of operations in the presence of all the
witnesses.

Every item of adjustment, test, observation, and measurement was checked
in the check record book, and described in detail in the daily record
book, to which are appended the signatures of all operators and
witnesses. The facts of preparation, measurements, and survey contained
in this work are taken from the records, attested and sworn to by the
entire Geodetic Staff and the investigating committee.

### Personnel of the Staff, Investigating Committee, and Corps of Witnesses

In our line of argument it is necessary to intro-duce the operators and
witnesses, that the reader may judge of the character of the testimony
concerning the facts observed; and to this end we publish the names of
all those connected in any way with the experiments and survey conducted
on the Florida coast. The operations and observations were not witnessed
by the Operating Staff alone.

Appended to this work are the statements of the visiting and
investigating committee, concerning the facts observed when the air line
was projected into the water on May 5, 1897, and the repetition of the
same on May 8; also the sworn statements of the operators and watchmen
concerning the precautions taken to prevent any one tampering with the
apparatus or its adjustments. In the list of the Operating Staff we
briefly mention the position each occupied, and the class of work to
which each was assigned:

U. G. Morrow, Geodesist, inventor of the Rectilineator; in charge of
field operations, experiments, and observations; tested adjustments and
measurements, and checked same in Record Books.

\*L. M. Boomer, General Manager.

Rev. E. M. Castle, of the University System of the Koreshan Unity;
inventor of the System of Reversals of sections of the Rectilineator.

G. T. Ordway, Operator; manipulated set screw No. 1; detached each rear
section, and transferred same for forward adjustment; made reversals in
accordance with the formula of the Castle System; signaled tide measures
from stationary caisson.

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

J. J. Williamson, Assistant Operator; manipulated set screw No. 2;
assisted in detachment of each rear section, and in the reversals;
watchman.

\*H. B. Boomer, Secretary.

George W. Hunt, Engineer; directed emplacement of the 8-foot platformed
standards, and adjustment of castings which received the sections of the
Rectilineator; in charge of all excavations, and setting of Tide Staffs.

P. W. Campbell, Mechanic and First Assistant Engineer; Assistant
Watchman.

Allen H. Andrews, Second Assistant Engineer; Assistant Watchman.
