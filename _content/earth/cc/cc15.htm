</p>  <h1 align="center">Forces and Factors Which Perpetuate Universe</h1>  
<p>THE revolution of the central star or stellar center which, from its positive and negative sides, produces the revolutions of the projected sun, precipitates also (in its revolutions) the essences of the sun, which come in contact with the inflowing substantial essences from the circumference. These unite in the atmospheres and appropriate their substances in processes of combustion.</p>  
<p>In this union of outflowing essences from the sun and inflowing essences from the circumference, and the burning of the substances of the atmospheres, there is a constant precipitation of matter,--reduced from the state or quality of spirit to the state or quality of matter.</p>  
<p>The earth's surface is thus constantly accumulating matter on its uppermost (innermost) surface, day by day, in the direction of the sun's apparent revolution around the earth,--which is really the projected sun's movement through the lower atmosphere,--in an orbit around the central star and within the crust or shell, the circumference of all.</p>  
<p>The superficial earth and water--the water represented by the large body of oceanic mass--are conditions of intermediate metamorphosis or change from</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_113"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 113</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the condition of spirit and aerial stages of substance to the mineral and metallic states. We have referred especially to the seven lamin&aelig; and their polate centers.</p>  
<p>The five mineral depositions or strata not directly represented by the known geologic formations are related to one another in mineral planes, and focalize their polate points in the five primary fixed stars, similarly to the focalization of the essences of the metallic planes in the centers called planets. The five earth planes, therefore, have five corresponding polations. Upon these seven polations of the metallic and five of the mineral spheres, depends the arrangement of all subsequent polations constituting the starry belt called the Zodiac.</p>  
<p>The Zodiac is divided into twelve sections, supposed by modern scientists to be merely arbitrary divisions having no natural foundations. The peculiar mapping out of the heavens into constellations, and naming them according to the names of certain forms of animal life, are regarded as purely arbitrary and the result of the ignorance and superstition of the ancients.</p>  
<p>We will here undertake to show that these tracings and mappings, or classification and nomenclature, are the result of the possession (by the ancients) of positive knowledges of the truth concerning not only the origin of the constellations, that is, of the focal centers, but of their special division into twelve segments, rather than the result of ignorance and superstition.</p>  
<p>In order to make plain to the reader the laws by which this division is governed, we must insist upon an effort to at least constantly hold the mind to the conception of the intraspherical philosophy, or that</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_114"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 114</FONT></A></p>  
<p>which demonstrates that we live within the sphere or globe, as opposed to the current teaching that we live upon the convex or outside surface of the globe.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">Origin of the Stars and Planets</h3>  
<p>The central star, the real polar point, which is the positive origin of the stars and planets, in transmitting its essences outwardly, forms around itself the circumambient space of light and darkness, or a positive and a negative side. Upon this peculiar arrangement depend night and day. The earth's surface is subject one half of the time, or about that, to the influence of the light side, and the other half of the time to the influence exerted upon the earth's surface by the darkness and its concomitants.</p>  
<p>In this revolution of the central star, which gives to us the appearance of the revolution of the sun in an orbit around the earth once in twenty-four hours, and which, by the modern scientific "lights" is interpreted to mean the rotation of the globe upon its axis every twenty-four hours, there must be presented to the earth two directly opposite poles--the light and dark poles. Half way between these poles there exist two others; one is the evening and the other is the morning. These are the poles of twilight. The evening is the caloric or heat pole; the other is the cruosic or cold pole.</p>  
<p>The revolution of the sun in one continuous direction causes the earth's encumberment of matter to follow as a consequence upon a perpetual spiral; not, however, a spiral of the same and persistent outfluence, but of a consecution of fluences modified by the specific effect of each polate point, as these points succeed one another in the order of the sun's rotation.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_115"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 115</FONT></A></p>  
<p>By this we mean that there are four orders of encumbering consecution; namely, midday, evening, midnight, and morning; and each of these points exerts its specific fluence upon not only the superficial surface of the earth, but upon its deeper surfaces also. The importance of this observation cannot be appreciated from a superficial consideration of the subject, especially when we take into account the earth or ground only, and the changes which take place there by the union of the ascending and the descending substances.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">What the Vegetable Kingdom Affords</h3>  
<p>The vegetable kingdom affords one of the most favorable opportunities to study these subtle fluences,--the outfluences and influences characteristically different at any two opposite polate points. In the foliage of vegetable life, the so called lungs of vegetation, there are carried on the double process and function, according to the period of the day to which it relates, of what partially agrees with the function of respiration in the lungs.</p>  
<p>In the morning the leaf gives forth oxygen, and in the evening carbonic acid gas, or carbonic anhydride. These are the marked characteristic differences in the respiration of plant life as pertaining to the caloric (evening) and the cruosic (morning) poles. The specific characteristic differences in the respiration of plants at midday and midnight, while as thoroughly opposite and distinct as the differences in the evening and morning, are of a more subtle character because partaking more of the nature of the transposition of spirit than of the more tangible substances--the gases.</p>  
<p>The foliage of the vegetable kingdom, it will be</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_116"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 116</FONT></A></p>  
<p>seen, performs more than the single function of respiration corresponding to the respiration of the lungs. In the respiratory function of the lungs there is a constant union of oxygen and nitrogen inhaled with the carbon, which constitutes the base of the venous corpuscle, and really constitutes the fuel for the process of combustion that is in constant operation. The carbon carried into the lungs by the venous circulation enters into an actual process of combustion, uniting with the oxygen which is inhaled by the respiratory action of the lungs.</p>  
<p>This union is not merely an absorption of oxygen, and therefore an oxygenation of the venous corpuscle, converting it to an arterial corpuscle, but it is the union or marriage of the white and the venous corpuscle by which is developed the red blood or arterial corpuscle. The carbonic anhydride exhaled or breathed out is the one product of combustion. This, as one of the offices of the lungs in the process of respiration, corresponds to the process which takes place in the leaf at night.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">What the Capillary System Affords</h3>  
<p>At the extremity of the arterial circulation there is a process the reverse of that which takes place in the lungs. There is a process of combustion in operation in the capillary circulation which, instead of transmitting outwardly the spirit corresponding to carbonic anhydride, which is exhaled by the lungs, carries it back into the venous circulation, thus carbonizing the blood and supplying it with its sugar, the foundation of the carbon corpuscle.</p>  
<p>In the animal structure the process of oxidation takes place at one extremity of the circulation, namely the lungs, and the process of carbonization at the other</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_117"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 117</FONT></A></p>  
<p>extremity. In the vegetable kingdom the processes of carbonization and oxidation take place at the same extremity; namely, in the foliage, but at the two extremes of the day.</p>  
<p>By this critical observation we see that morning and evening are the two extremities of a cycle or revolution, and that the foliage is related to every degree of this revolution, and represents the entire cycle. The revolution of the day has its four polate centers, and of course its intermediate segments of the cycle. The leaf represents this cycle complete.</p>  
<p>In the animal kingdom, of which man (who constitutes the microcosm) is the representative, we have noticed two extremes; that which corresponds to midday, (viewing the lungs from their office as performed toward the circulation, and not as to exhalation,) and midnight, represented by the other extremity of the circulation. We thus define the polate centers in the microcosm, corresponding to the two supreme points of the revolution.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">Relation of Microcosm to Macrocosm</h3>  
<p>In the relation of the microcosm to the macrocosm there is developed an important discovery; namely, that the motion is inversely to the motism and statism of the physical macrocosm. For instance, in the physical macrocosm the vegetative and vegetable form and function are stable, and the diurnal relations are mobile. In the microcosm, the vegetative form and function are mobile, and the diurnal relations are stable. It is thus discovered that the stable things in the microcosm are the mobile things in the macrocosm, and that the mobile things in the microcosm are the stable things in the macrocosm.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_118"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 118</FONT></A></p>  
<p>We have presented the vegetable kingdom as an illustration of the action of the four polate points or centers, having defined especially the two prominent poles and their fluences upon the function of respiration as exhibited in the plant. If the plant exhales and inhales, the zone or sphere of revolution (as related to the plant) has a complementary inhalation and exhalation inverse to that of the plant. This exhalation and inhalation must be specifically and correspondentially active at the four poles described, to correspond to, complement, and co-ordinate the activities of the vegetable respiration.</p>  
<p>Vegetation alone, while exhibiting the phenomena in a marked degree, is not the only department of the physical circumference subject to and modified by these subtle fluences. The metallic and mineral deposits, the various earths, rocks, salts, etc., also the water over the surface of the earth, constantly inhale and exhale to meet specifically the fluences of these polate centers. The substances transposed in the form of gases and in the conditions of various essences are invariably the consequences of the combustion in operation in the earth, water, and air.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">An Unsettled Problem</h3>  
<p>It is claimed that the surface of the earth moves from west to east nearly twenty-five thousand miles in twenty-four hours. According to modern "science," this is a solid body moving through space at a rotary speed of over one thousand miles an hour, or more than sixteen miles per minute. Can any sane man imagine that a solid body with this rate of speed, surrounded by a thin atmosphere, can so carry its</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_119"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 119</FONT></A></p>  
<p>atmosphere with its momentum as not to produce a contrary motion of the atmosphere, while at the same time it would cause the rotation of an oscillating pendulum?</p>  
<p>No one disputes the fact of the motion of the pendulum, as first observed by Foucault, and later experimented with by Flammarion. We might, however, question the uniform direction of the oscillating pendulum in a series of experiments. But allowing the experiment to be fair and the motion as reported, we would inquire, What causes such a phenomenon?</p>  
<p>Whatsoever the cause of the motion it must be considered with regard to two propositions;--first, the supposition that the earth revolves because the heavens <i>appear</i> to revolve; and the motion of the pendulum is taken as corroborative testimony to an hypothesis, a guess, which still hangs in doubt with the astronomers, for the reason that with howsoever much reinforcement you sustain a guess, it still remains hypothetical. And the astronomers will not stop seeking for still further corroboration, because they are still in doubt. We wish to assure our readers that the problem is not settled under the Copernican system.</p>  
<p>The second proposition is that the Koreshan Geodetic Survey has settled forever the fact that the earth is a concave shell, and that man inhabits the cellular sphere. If it could be proven that the earth rotates, then the pendulum would act the same on the inner as it would on the outer surface of a ball, were it the motion of the earth that caused it. It could not, therefore, affect the fact of the Cellular Cosmogony in the least.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">The Earth Comparatively Stationary</h3>  
<p>According to the Koreshan System, the earth is comparatively stationary and the heavens are moving within the stationary earth. The sun is moving at the rate of about eighteen thousand miles in twenty-four hours. It is sweeping through space with this velocity and radiating its "energies" into the environing shell, in which there is a corresponding magnetic spiral motion.</p>  
<p>To this spiral motion of "energy" is due the rotation of the pendulum, and not to the motion of the earth. First, it will be understood that the pendulum is suspended from a support attached solidly to the body of the earth. Second, it will be noticed that the curve of the earth is practically the same at both extremes of the oscillation, the earth moving just as rapidly at one point as at the other. There could not be a calculable commensuration of difference either in time or space, at the two extremities, as to curvation or the time of longitudinal motion.</p>  
<p>If the pendulum is swung from north to south and south to north at the start, it would be subject to the eastward motion of the earth, which, were the theory of the earth's rotate impression in relation to the pendulum ball true, the ball would apparently move toward the west, and with the opposite swing of the pendulum it would swing equally toward the west--the motion on one side balancing the other. This would be the effect if the phenomenon were the result of the earth's motion.</p>  
<p>How would it be when the pendulum rotated around to the east and west points? The earth would be rotating toward the east, the pendulum swinging east and west. The earth is moving, according to the</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_121"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 121</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Copernican hypothesis, at the rate of sixteen miles a minute either with or against the ball, while it swings westward, and at the same rate with it when the ball swings eastward. If the earth by its rotation affects the motion of the pendulum enough to cause this rotation, why would it not make an appreciable difference distinctively marked while swinging east and west?</p>  
<p>The swinging of a pendulum could bear no possible relation to the earth's rotation, even if the earth were a ball rotating from east to west at the rate of twenty-five thousand miles in twenty-four hours. . . . The marvelous thing about this experiment, is that any man possessing any claim whatsoever to the title of scientific, should accept this solution without asking the question, "May there not be some hypothesis for this motion, as reasonable as, or more so than, the hypothesis of the rotation of the earth?"</p>  
<p>If a pendulum were swung at the north oscillating laterally across the plane of the earth's rotation, (were there such a motion of the earth,) the pendulum hung in space (not upon supports solidly in the earth), there would be some sense to the proposition; as it is it is the veriest nonsense, and later the "scientists" will laugh at their own folly.</p>
