<p>"When we consider that the advocates of the earth's stationary position can account for and explain the celestial phenomena as accurately, to their own thinking, as we can to ours, in addition to which they have the evidences of their senses, which we have not, and Scriptures and facts in their favor, which we have not, it is not without some show of reason that they maintain the superiority of their system. Whereas, we must be content, at present, to take for granted the truth of the hypothesis of the earth's motion for one thing. We shall never, indeed, arrive at a time when we shall be able to pronounce it absolutely proved to be true. The nature, of the subject excludes such a possibility. However perfect our theory may appear, in our estimation, and however satisfactorily the Newtonian hypothesis may seem to account for all celestial phenomena, yet we are here compelled to admit the astounding truth, that if our premise be disputed and our facts challenged, the whole range of astronomy does not contain the proofs of its own accuracy. Startling as this announcement may appear, it is nevertheless true; and astronomy would indeed be helpless, were it not for the implied approval of those whose authority is considered a guarantee of its truth. Should this sole refuge fail us, all our arguments, all our observations, all our boasted accuracy would be useless, and the whole science of modern astronomy must fall to the ground!"--Dr. Woodhouse, Astronomer, Cambridge, Eng.</p>  
<p>Let no one, "so far as hypotheses are concerned, expect anything certain from astronomy, since that science can afford nothing of the kind. The hypothesis of the terrestrial motion of the earth was nothing but an hypothesis, valuable only so far as it explained phenomena, and not to be considered with reference to absolute truth."--Copernicus, Founder of Modern Astronomy.</p>  
<p>"In whatever way or manner may have occurred this business, I must still say that I curse this modern theory of cosmogony (the Copernican system), and hope that perchance there may appear in due time some scientist of genius who will pick up courage to upset this universally disseminated delirium of lunatics."--Von Goethe.</p>  
<p>"For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead." (Rom. i: 20.)</p>  
<p>"Who hath measured the waters in the hollow [concavity] of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?" (Isa. xl: 12.)</p>

<p>"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? . . . Who hast laid the measures thereof? or who hath stretched the line upon it?" (Job xxxviii: 4, 5.)</p>  
<p>The "man with a measuring line in his hand," who "stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand." "He stood, and measured the earth." (Zech. ii: 1; Amos vii: 7, Hab. iii: 6.)</p>
