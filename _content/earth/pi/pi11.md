### CHAPTER IX

### A Matter of Words

RECENTLY, while reading a book of legends concerning ancient Mexico, I
came across one originating in Wicam Switch, Sonora. I had never heard
of Wicam Switch. Sounding the name of the town, phonetically, in
Spanish, it came out "Whee sham." "Whee sham"—Hwui Sham. It seemed
incredible—yet there it was.

If Hwui Shan came into Mexico from California or Arizona, he would have
travelled through Sonora. A name like that in that specific territory,
may probably have been the merest coincidence, yet, there was no
alternative but to examine it more thoroughly. If there were any others
of a similar sound in that general territory, then this one was not
coincidence—if there were none, then it was purely accidental. If Hwui
Shan passed that way, and the people wished to perpetuate his memory,
this would have been an appropriate way in which to have done it and it
would, in all probability, have been done more than once.

On the chance that there were similarly related names close by, I
checked the map to see and I found so many that the matter could no
longer be in doubt. For a time, it seemed like the power of suggestion
must have gotten the better of my reason. It looked like one was hiding
back of every tree. Names that had no significance to one group were
found neatly lodged in another and unrelated group—and with no apparent
reason, meaning or significance there. Why would the Maya of Yucatan use
a word with a root identical to the Huichol of the Mexican west coast—a
people they never heard of? Their basic languages were different. They
had no connection.

I decided to trace what I could and chose three words arbitrarily—"Hwui
Shan," the name of the stranger within their gates; "Pi-k’iu," for he
was a mendicant Buddhist priest; and "Saka-muni" whose religion he was
teaching.

Using the same sound to the ear, and taking a choice of a dozen or more
spellings, here is a small sample of what I found:

These towns are strung out from central Arizona to Yucatan. The cultures
that they represent have no linguistic affinity for each other. In none
of the cultures is there a meaning for any one of the three base words.

Sacaton, as pointed out earlier, was the situs of the effigy of Ha-ak
and the giant horse. A shrine had been erected there to her memory. If
Hwui Shan had visited that shrine, what more appropriate name could he
have given it than the "place of Saka?" The location was a sacred place
to the Indian—sacred spots are sacred to the Saka-muni, the holy man of
Saka. Would that not be a logical name for another sacred spot?

Cuilapan, State of Oaxaca, famous for its cochineal and nopal cactus,
was another name that appeared to be related phonetically to Hwui. "Cui"
and "Hwui" sound very little different

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

and "la" and "sha" are not too far distant. Taking into account the 1000
year lapse when the sound was transmitted orally, we can recognize that
"Cui-la" probably started out as "Whee-sha"—the "pan" is a contraction
of ichpan, meaning "within the enclosure." Hwui Shan would have been in
that area.

"Hue nem" and "Hwui Shan" are too close to be overlooked. Point Hueneme,
California, is the spot where I indicated earlier that I believed that
Hwui Shan landed. The reason for so believing, is due to the highly
significant name, coupled with the fact that names were given in
association with some important occurrence. Point Hueneme is well within
the general area where Hwui Shan would in all probability have landed
and, therefore, I believe that this marks the actual spot.

Naming cities or villages after a person, or a home town, is an old and
honored custom. We have Washington, D.C.; Washington State; Washington,
Pennsylvania; Washington, Illinois; Washington, Iowa, plus one for most
other states (places George never saw)—New York; Boston; Chester;
Pittsburgh; Jamestown and hundreds of others. That the custom was in
vogue in 500 A.D., in Yucatan, has foundation in the following account
quoted from Bishop Landa:

"This Kukulcan established another city after arranging with the native
lords of the country that he and they should live there and that all
their affairs and business should be brought there; and for this purpose
they chose a very good situation, eight leagues further in the interior
than Merida is now, and fifteen or sixteen leagues from the sea. They
surrounded it with a very broad stone wall, laid dry, of about an eighth
of a league, leaving in it only two narrow gates. The wall was not very
high and in the midst of this enclosure they built their temples, and
the largest, which is like that of Chichen Itza, they called Kukulcan,
and they built another building of a round form, with four doors,
entirely different from all the others in that land, as well as a great
number of others round about joined together. In this enclosure they
built houses for the lords only, dividing all the land among them,
giving towns to each one, according

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

to the antiquity of his lineage and his personal value. And Kukulcan
gave a name to this city—not his own as the Ah Itzas had done at Chichen
Itza, which means the well of the Ah Itzas, but he called it Mayapan,
which means the 'standard of the Maya,' because they called the language
of the country Maya, and the Indians (say) 'Ichpa' which means 'within
the enclosure.' This Kukulcan lived with the lords of that city for
several years; and leaving them in great peace and friendship, he
returned by the same way to Mexico, and on the way he stopped at
Champoton, and, in memory of him and of his departure, he erected a fine
building in the sea like that at Chichen Itza, a long stone's throw from
the shore. And then Kukulcan left a perpetual
[remembrance](errata.htm#27) in Yucatan."

The Ah Itzas named Chichen Itza after themselves—but Kukulcan did not,
he called his city "Mayapan." Yet he left a building near Champoton in
memory of himself. The custom was recognized. The Ah Itzas did it.
Important personages perpetuated their own names in that day as well as
this. Since "Kukulcan" did not wish to have the city named for himself,
as the Ah Itzas did, either because he thought that there were already
too many so named, or he wished to honor the name of some other, he
named the city "Mayapan." He chose the name "Maya." Was there some good
reason? Maya, it will be remembered, was the name of the mother of the
Buddha. It would be a logical choice, would it not, for any Buddhist
priest wishing to perpetuate the name of the mother of his saint, to
name a city for her? "Mayapan" the city was named—within the enclosure
of Maya.

If that one seems fantastic, its close neighbor is even more so. Back of
the next tree, the most amazing one of all, to me at least, is
Guatemala—the place of Gautama!

Both words—"Maya" and "Guatemala"—have bothered students of language for
years. No root or meaning has so far been found for either of them.
Perhaps this is the answer.

Recalling the story in the Mani Chronicle, of the "Tutul Xiu," who came
to Yucatan from Mexico in company with Holon Chan Tepeuh, we noted the
comparison of the noble-

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

man called, in Chinese, "Tui-lu," with the "Tutul Xiu" of the Maya. It
was pointed out that the Maya stated that the Mexican "Tutul Xiu"
arrived in Yucatan accompanied by a stranger named "Holon Chan Tepeuh"
and his subjects or followers. If the "Tutul Xiu" of the Maya were one
and the same as the "Tui-lu" of the Chinese, then was not the Maya, in
his hieroglyphics, trying to identify for us "Holon Chan Tepeuh" as
"Hwui Shan, Pi-k’iu"? It can be no other than the Chinese name with a
transmigration through Mayan hieroglyphics that has emerged. Holon Chan
Tepeuh was of sufficient importance to have had his name remembered
although the Tutul Xiu was not. Holon Chan was then more important than
the lord with whom he came. He must, likewise, have made converts, since
he was said to have been accompanied by his "subjects or followers." The
Tutul Xiu was a dignitary—he was acting as a guide for a more important
person, a stranger.

Insofar as the Mani Chronicle itself is concerned—was the name "Mani"
originally "Muni"? What about "Champoton" the city by the sea that
Kukulcan built as a final tribute? Was it a carry-over from the name of
the great Buddhist stronghold in Cambodia, Champa? According to Fa-hien,
the Buddha walked in Champa during one of his periods of meditation.

One final word needed looking into. The dance of the "Chinelos" was
stated to have been called "Zinelohque" in Nahuatl, according to Dr.
Redfield. The word, Zinelohque, itself suggested the present-day sound
of Sinaloa, the area in which the dance was supposed to have originated.

If the ancient Nahuatl used a word "Zinelohque," and gave it a meaning
of "Chinese" or "foreign," would it not be fair to assume that, if the
Chinese were in that section, that they themselves named the area
"Sin-lo"? "Sin-lo" was the ancient Chinese name for Korea. (Fa-hien
spelled it SINHALA). Korea may have been the last place the Chinese had
sight of land when leaving their homes, or the coast of Mexico reminded
them of the coast of Korea—whatever the reason—the Chinese no doubt did
the naming. Further, was it the Nahuatl who shortened the word, as they
had a habit of shortening words,

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

and called the foreigners "Sino"? Then did the early Spaniards set the
sound down as "Chino"? Perhaps a study could be made in the
[pueblecito](errata.htm#28) of Chinoaqui, Sinaloa.

Sin-loa, Sinaloa and Zinelohque, are not words that would crash into a
language unintroduced. They were brought there.
