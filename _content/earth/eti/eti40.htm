<p>"This is incredible," I exclaimed.</p>  
<p>"You need not be astonished," he answered. "Is there any argument that can be offered to controvert the assertion that man is ignorant of many natural laws?"</p>  
<p>"I can offer none."</p>  
<p>"Is there any doubt that a force, distinct and separate from matter, influences matter and vivifies it into a living personality?"</p>  
<p>"I do not deny that there is such force."</p>  
<p>"What then should prevent this force from existing separate from the body if it be capable of existing in it?"</p>  
<p>"I can not argue against such a position."</p>  
<p>"If, as is hoped and believed by the majority of mankind, even though some try to deny the fact, it is possible for man to exist as an association of earth matters, linked to a personal spirit force, the soul, and for the spirit force, after the death of the body, to exist independent of the grosser attributes of man, free from his mortal body, is it not reasonable to infer that the spirit, while it is still in man and linked to his body, may be educated and developed so as, under favorable conditions, to meet and communicate with other spirits that have been previously liberated front earthly bondage?"</p>  
<p>"I submit," I answered; "but you shock my sensibilities when you thus imply that by cold, scientific investigation we can place ourselves in a position to meet the unseen spirit world"&#151;</p>  
<p>It was now my turn to hesitate.</p>  
<p>"Go on," he said.</p>  
<p>"To commune with the angels," I answered.</p>  
<p>"A study of true science is a study of God," he continued. "Angels are organizations natural in accordance with God's laws. They appear superhuman, because of our ignorance concerning</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_225"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 225</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the higher natural forces. They exist in exact accordance with the laws that govern the universe; but as yet the attraction between clay and clay-bound spirit is so great as to prevent the enthralled soul of man from communicating with them. Tie faith of the religionist is an example of the unquenchable feeling that creates a belief as well as a hope that there is a self-existence separate from earthy substances. The scoffing scientific agnostic, working for other objects, will yet astonish himself by elaborating a method that will practically demonstrate these facts, and then empirical religion, as exemplified by the unquestioning faithful believer, and systematic science, as typified in the experimental materialist, will meet on common ground."</p>
