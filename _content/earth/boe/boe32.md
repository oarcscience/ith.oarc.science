### The World Octaves

IT WAS HIS PROLONGED OBSERVATION of the movement of Mars ([Fig.
95](boe31.htm#img_fig095)) that led Kepler to discover the true form of
the planetary orbits, till then considered to be perfectly circular, and
it was during the last year of his observations (1596) that he hit upon
his beautiful "solution" of the "cosmographic mystery." He believed in
the harmony of the spheres, and all his life he sought for some true and
simple law binding the members of the solar system together. His first
step was to discover the law connecting the relative distances of the
planets, some simple ratio of distances that would do away with the
complex and multiplied epicycles and excentrics with which Ptolemy and
his successors had troubled, if not the heavens,

the minds of men. By accident he was brought finally to seek this law of
distances through simple geometry. A diagram he had drawn during a
lecture, to illustrate the cycles of the great conjunctions of the
planets, reminded him, in a sudden flash of illumination, of the "five
regular solids," the "five mathematical bodies" (-6); and for the rest
of his life he worked on the theory that these beautiful solids bore
within themselves a proportion answering to the several distances of the
planets from each other. That is, if we describe a circle around a cube
and another inside it, or a circle about a tetrahedron and another
within it, the distances between these circumscribed and inscribed
circles will show the proportional distances of the planets each from
the other between which these five solids fit.

Between the six planetary spheres there are five intervals, and Kepler
placed the five solids between the spheres as follows:

That is, the sphere of Jupiter is inscribed in a cube to which the
sphere of Saturn is circumscribed; the sphere

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

of Jupiter is circumscribed to a tetrahedron in which the sphere of Mars
is inscribed, and so on. The rest is mathematics.

In Kepler's beautiful drawings of his solids (), which, more than plane
figures, he said, must belong to Space, he assigned to each form that
one of the great elements whose "component particle" corresponded.
Within a crystalline cube he placed a mountain, a tree, a sprouted and
leafing plant, and tools for tilling the Earth. Within the tetrahedron
he placed fire; within the dodecahedron the firmament; within the
icosahedron water and the inhabitants of water; within the octahedron
"flying birds."

Kepler's "intervals" were not only spaces for the five mathematical
bodies; they were also "notes" in an harmonic universal scale. His
harmony of the spheres was not only the harmony of movement but the
result of movement--sound. It was unimaginable that the grand
revolutions of the spheres through Space were made in silence;
unimaginable also that the ears of men could hear the prodigious concert
of the whole universe in its rapid revolution. As they must close their
eyes against the Sun, too bright to see, so must their ears be closed
against a harmony too vibrant to endure.

Yet, if the ears of man may not hear the music of the spheres, his eyes
may follow the paths of celestial sound, said Robert Fludd, and
straightway began to "draw" the music of the spheres. "This," he wrote
at the top of the first figure of his series of World Octaves, in his
*Musica Mundana* ([Plate XL](#img_pl40)), "is the world monochord, with
its

proportions, harmonies and intervals of its extra-mundane movement
accurately spaced as herein depicted." Earth--the mute because
motionless Earth of the Pythagoreans--plays its part through the
division of the elements, Earth, Water, Air, and Fire. Only when the
Earth's atmosphere reaches the zone of the Moon is the first note struck
of the great C major scale. Beyond the seven zones of the Moon, the Sun,
and the five planets, and above the firmament of the fixed stars, the
divisions of the upper heavens correspond to those of the Earth below.

[Plate XLI](#img_pl41) is the second of the series, taken up again in
his *Microcosmi Historia*, in which man is shown as participator in the
heavenly scale. Here is a single octave, instead of two, as in the
preceding drawing; its scale given in terms of mind or reason, rather
than in terms of the elements and the heavenly bodies. From A, the
Absolute Mind or Essence of the Godhead, or Unity, or Spirit, it
descends through B, the creative or active intellect, the first vehicle
of the mind, to C, mind and intellect in the rational spirit (or the
passive intellect), to D, the rational spirit together with mind and
intellect in the median soul, to E, the median soul floating in the
aethereal liquid (in other words, the Living Light combined with Mind),
to F, the Body (or man), which is the receptacle of all things.

And then, having given the two-octaved universe--Heaven and Earth, and
the one-octaved universe stretching from the Godhead to man, he drew a
third figure ([Plate XLII](boe33.htm#img_pl42)) of the three-octaved
universe, with its three

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

great scales of correspondences, rising one above the other, each
corresponding exactly, note by note, to the other two, whether higher or
lower. Sound, he says, is the connecting link between the three worlds;
for sound is the language of the mind. Vibration is the secret of
creation, and through it all secrets may be revealed, if the sleeping
mind and memory of man is ever wakened through its power.
