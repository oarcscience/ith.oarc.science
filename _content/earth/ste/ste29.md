**MADAM**,

*HAVING had the honour to present the first part of this Theory to Your
ROYAL UNCLE, I presume to offer the Second to Your Majesty. This part of
the Subject, I hope, will be no less acceptable, for certainly ’tis of
no less importance. They both indeed agree in this, That there is a
WORLD made and destroy’d in either Treatise. But we are more concern’d
in what is to come, than in what is past. And as the former Books
represented to us the Rise and Fall of the First World; so These give an
account of the present Frame of Nature labouring under the last Flames,
and of the Resurrection of it in the* New Heavens *and* New Earth:
*which, according to the Divine Promises, we are to expect*.

*Cities that are burnt, are commonly rebuilt more beautiful and regular
than they were before. And when this World is demolish’d by the last
Fire, He that undertakes to rear it up again, will supply the defects,
if there were any, of the former Fabrick. This Theory supposes the
present Earth to be little better than an Heap of Ruines: where yet
there is room enough for Sea and Land, for Islands and Continents, for
several Countries and Dominions: But when these are all melted down, and
refin’d in the general Fire, they will be cast into a better mould, and
the Form and Qualities of the Earth will become Paradisiacal*.

*But, I fear, it may be thought no very proper address, to shew Your
Majesty a World laid in ashes, where You have so great an interest Your
Self, and such fair Dominions; and then, to recompence the loss by
giving a Reversion in a Future Earth. But if that future Earth be a
second Paradise, to be enjoyed for a Thousand Years; with Peace,
Innocency, and constant health: An Inheritance there will be an happy
exchange for the best Crown in this World*.

*I confess, I could never perswade my self, that the Kingdom of Christ
and of his Saints, which the Scripture speaks of so frequently, was
design’d to be upon this present Earth. But however, upon all
suppositions, They that have done some eminent Good in this Life, will
be sharers in the happiness of that State. To humble the Oppressors, and
rescue the Oppressed, is a work of Generosity and Charity that cannot
want its reward; Yet,* MADAM*, They are the greatest Benefactors to
Mankind, that dispose the World to become Vertuous: and by their
example, Influence, and Authority, retrieve that* TRUTH *and* JUSTICE*,
that have been lost, amongst *

*men, for many Ages. The School-Divines tell us, Those that act or
suffer great things for the Publick Good, are distinguish’d in Heaven by
a Circle of Gold about their Heads. One would not willingly vouch for
that: but one may safely for what the Prophet says, which is far
greater: namely, that They shall shine like Stars in the Firmament,
that* turn many to Righteousness*. Which is not to be understood, so
much, of the Conversion of single Souls, as of the turning of Nations
and People, The turning of the World to Righteousness. They that lead on
that great and happy Work, shall be distinguish’d in Glory from the rest
of Mankind*.

*We are sensible,* MADAM*, from Your Great Example, that Piety and
Vertue seated upon a Throne, draw many to imitation, whom ill
Principles, or the course of the World, might have led another way.
These are the best, as well as easiest Victories, that are gain’d
without Contest. And as Princes are the Vicegerents of God upon Earth,
so when their Majesty is in Conjunction with Goodness, it hath a double
Character of Divinity upon it: and we owe them a double Tribute, of Fear
and Love. Which, with constant Prayers for Your* MAJESTY'S *present and
future Happiness, shall be always Dutifully paid, by*
