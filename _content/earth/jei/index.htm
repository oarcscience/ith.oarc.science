<P>Marshall B. Gardner, a hollow-earth proponent, published the first edition
of this book in 1913, <I>after</I> Peary reached the North Pole in 1909.
Gardner thus had a much harder job than
<A HREF="../potp/index">William Reed</A>; that is, overcoming the
public perception that the poles had been reached.
</P>
<P>
Gardner's book is in some ways superior to other books in this genre.
He attempts to come up with a scientific hypothesis to explain the formation
of hollow planets, instead of divine fiat or no explanation at all.
He is also a lot more readable.
One of the most enjoyable parts of this book is Gardner's fantasy account
of a journey into the interior of the hollow earth, which, while not up
to the standards of Jules Verne, seems almost plausible if you can suspend
your disbelief temporarily.
</P>
<P>
Naturally, a great deal of the book consists of narratives of arctic explorers
(covering some of same material as Reed).
The book marshals a great deal of anomalous polar evidence,
such as attested warm regions near the poles, red dust, strange
auroras and so on.
Last but not least are those poor flash-frozen Siberian mammoths,
who seem to crop up with such regularity in the crank literature,--probably
because traditional scientific explanations of their demise always
sound so fishy when quoted out of context.</P>
<P>
There is a long section at the end where he deals with the response
to the first edition of his book, including an opponent who raises
a theory of a prehistoric 90 degree polar shift
to account for some of the same evidence!
By contrast, a hollow earth would definitely be more plausible.
</P>
<P>
Although Gardner doesn't attack the scientific method or basic physical
laws, as other alternative earth theorists do, perhaps he <I>should</I> have.
According to traditional physics, inside of a hollow earth-sized sphere
there should be zero gravity; and centrifugal force caused
by the earth's rotation would be insufficient to keep things
inside the hollow earth from floating away, either.
Working out the math of a star small enough to fit inside the earth,
not too hot to fry the interior surface,
and not too dense to turn into a black hole is 'left as an exercise.'
The charming idea of denizens of the hollow earth going about their
business lit by a never-setting mini-sun is simply a fantasy.
