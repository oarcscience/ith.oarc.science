James Hutton (1726-1797) is considered the father of modern geology.
Although less well known than [Darwin](../../aor/darwin/index), Hutton's
theory is one of the cornerstones of the modern rationalist view of the
world. Hutton was one of the first scientists to propose that the Earth
is extremely old, much older than the few thousand years that a literal
reading of Genesis would indicate. This caused a furour much like
Darwin's [Origin of Species](../../aor/darwin/origin/index) when it was
first released.

Leonardo Da Vinci had privately speculated about this two centuries
earlier in his [notebooks](../../aor/dv/index), noting the presence of
marine fossils on the top of mountains, and estimating the huge amount
of time it would take to carve out river valleys. But Hutton was the
first to reject the 'Neptunian' theory of his day which saw a universal
deluge (presumably, the Noachian flood) as the source of geological
formation. Instead he proposed a 'Vulcanian' theory, in which processes
of heat from the earth's interior had built up continents and mountains
over a long period of time.

In later times this became couched in terms of 'Catastrophism' versus
'Gradualism,' with the gradualists eventually winning out. This is why
conventional geologists reject ideas such as
[Atlantis](../../atl/index), Lemuria, or pole shifts out of hand,
working from first principles. However, 21st century geologists have
become less prickly about the occasional catastrophic event, such as the
Oregon Scablands, which were formed when a glacial dam broke at the end
of the ice ages.

The two texts provided here are his 1788 paper Theory of the Earth, read
before the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and the two extant volumes of his
1795 book of the same name in which he not only elaborated his views but
defended them against the bitter criticism that had been leveled against
him in the interim. Although his books, filled with long quotes in
French, make difficult reading, Hutton deserves to be better known as
one of the makers of the modern view of the Earth.
