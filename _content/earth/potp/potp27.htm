<p>The earth is either hollow or it is not. What proof have we concerning the latter? Not one iota, positive or circumstantial. On the contrary, everything points to its being hollow. If it be so, and there are burning volcanoes in the interior, would you not see great lights reflected on the icebergs and the clouds just as any other great fires reflect the light? Would not great clouds of smoke and dust be seen?---the same as from any other burning volcano? That is what all the explorers have witnessed--low, dark clouds rising out of the ocean, or at the edge of the ice. Nansen says: "Let us go home; what have we here to stay for? Nothing but dust, dust, dust." Where could such dust come from--so bad that it was one of the great annoyances in the heart of the Arctic Ocean--if it did not come from an exploding, burning volcano? If the earth be hollow, would it not be warmer in winter and cooler in summer?</p>  
<p>Arctic explorers say that a north wind</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_283"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 283</FONT></A></p>  
<p>in winter raises the temperature, while a south wind lowers it. As an opposite fact, in summer a south wind raises the temperature and a north wind lowers it. This is just what would occur if the winds came from the interior of the earth. Again: if the earth be hollow, it could not he round, inasmuch as the opening would take from its roundness in proportion to the size of the opening. All now agree that the earth is flattened at the poles. Also, it is warmer the farther one goes north or south. Why is this the case?</p>  
<p>There is but one answer, and that is that the earth is hollow, and is warmer in the interior than on the exterior. As the wind passes out in the winter it warms the atmosphere. If the earth be solid, neither science nor reason furnishes any rational theory why it should be warmer as one passes north. Every known theory is against such a conclusion. As soon as you adopt the belief that the earth is hollow, perplexing questions will be easily solved, the mind will be satisfied, and the triumph of sensible reasoning will come as a delight never to be forgotten.</p>  </div>  </BODY>
