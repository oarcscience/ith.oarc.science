<P>
Still one of the largest pieces of architecture ever constructed,
the Great Pyramid has long been the subject of wonder as to when it
was built, by whom, and most importantly, <I>why</I>.
The conventional explanation is that it was built during the reign of
the Pharaoh Khufu by skilled Egyptian laborers as a funerary monument.
In the 19th century, in the absence of hard information other than detailed
studies of its dimensions, a whole class of speculation grew up which
has been called 'pyramidology.'
The pyramidologists came to believe that the Great Pyramid encoded
advanced knowledge of the physical universe,
and the course of human history.
This book is one of the primary texts of pyramidology.
</P>
<P>
In addition to pyramidology,
Joseph Seiss was a Christian dispensationalist, a 19th century millennialist
school of thought.
The dispensationalists viewed human history as a series of
covenants with God.
They were certain that the end of days could be pinpointed using
Biblical prophecy.
This was the origin of a set of beliefs widely accepted by
contemporary evangelical Christians.
</P>
<P>
Seiss advances many dubious assertions, such as
his statement that there were no predecessors to the Great Pyramid.
Egypt is dotted with dozens of prior examples, including several
that collapsed because the Egyptians were still experimenting with the correct
proportions.
He makes a whole range of claims that specific dimensions of the Great
Pyramid, when multiplied by some other number, can be associated with
the size of the axis of the Earth, its density, and so on
(a staple of the pyramidologist literature).
He matches details of the interior passages to the dispensationalist
timeline.
And he somehow concludes that the Egyptians did not build the pyramid, but some
other hitherto obscure race of Philistines, led by an individual
named Melchisedec, who was identical to the Biblical Job!
</P>
<P>
Seiss and the other 19th century pyramidologists have abundant modern
successors.
Their answer to 'when' goes as far back as the last ice age; their
answer to 'who' includes space aliens and Atlanteans, and their 'why'
includes 'as a huge electrical generator.'
Time will tell whether their theories will appear as spurious
as Seiss a hundred years from now,
or lead to some radical new understanding of the
'Miracle in Stone.'
