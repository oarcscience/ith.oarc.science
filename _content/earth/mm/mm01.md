*Mythical Monsters*, by Charles Gould, \[1886\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PREFACE.

THE Author has to express his great obligations to many gentlemen who
have assisted him in the preparation of this volume, either by affording
access to their libraries, or by furnishing or revising translations
from the Chinese, &c.; and he must especially tender them to J. Haas,
Esq., the Austro-Hungarian Vice-Consul at Shanghai, to Mr. Thomas
Kingsmill and the Rev. W. Holt of Shanghai, to Mr. Falconer of
Hong-Kong, and to Dr. N. B. Dennys of Singapore.

For the sake of uniformity, the author has endeavoured to reduce all the
romanised representations of Chinese sounds to the system adopted by S.
W. Williams, whose invaluable dictionary is the most available one for
students. No alteration, however, has been made when quotations from
eminent sinologues like Legge have been inserted.

Should the present volume prove sufficiently interesting to attract
readers, a second one will be issued at a future date, in continuation
of the subject.

*June*, 1884.

NOTE BY THE PUBLISHERS.

THE Publishers think it right to state that, owing to the Author's
absence in China, the work has not had the advantage of his supervision
in its passage through the press. It is also proper to mention that the
MS. left the Author's hands eighteen months ago.

13, WATERLOO PLACE. S.W.  
*January*, 1886.
