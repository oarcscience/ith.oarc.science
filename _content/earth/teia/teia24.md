# NOTES

### PREFACE

A Full account of the rediscovery of the Canaries in 1341 will be found
in Major's "Life of Prince Henry of Portugal" (London, 1868), p. 138.
For the statement as to the lingering belief in the Jacquet Island, see
Winsor's "Columbus," p. 111. The extract from Cowley is given by Herman
Melville in his picturesque paper on "The Encantadas" (*Putnam's
Magazine*, III. 319). In Harris's "Voyages" (1702) there is a map giving
"Cowley's Inchanted Isl." (I. 78), but there is no explanation of the
name. The passage quoted by Melville is not to be found in Cowley's
"Voyage to Magellanica and Polynesia," given by Harris in the same
volume, and must be taken from Cowley's "Voyage round the Globe," which
I have not found in any library.

### I. ATLANTIS

For the original narrative of Socrates, see Plato's "Timæus" and
"Critias," in each of which it is given. For further information see the
chapter on the Geographical Knowledge of the Ancients by W. H.
Tillinghast, in Winsor's "Narrative and Critical History of America," I.
15. He mentions (I. 19, note) a map printed at Amsterdam in 1678 by
Kircher, which shows Atlantis as a large island midway between Spain and

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> America. Ignatius
Donnelly's "Atlantis, the Antediluvian World" (N. Y. 1882), maintains
that the evidence for the former existence of such an island is
irresistible, and his work has been very widely read, although it is not
highly esteemed by scholars.

### II. TALIESSIN

The Taliessin legend in its late form cannot be traced back beyond the
end of the sixteenth century, but the account of the transformation is
to be found in the "Book of Taliessin," a manuscript of the thirteenth
century, preserved in the Hengwt Collection at Peniarth. The Welsh bard
himself is supposed to have flourished in the sixth century. See Alfred
Nutt in "The Voyage of Bram" (London, 1897), II. 86. The traditions may
be found in Lady Charlotte Guest's translation of the "Mabinogion," 2d
ed., London, 1877, p. 471. The poems may be found in the original Welsh
in Skene's "Four Ancient Books of Wales," 2 vols., Edinburgh, 1868; and
he also gives a facsimile of the manuscript.

### III. CHILDREN OF LIR

The lovely legend of the children of Lir or Lear forms one of those
three tales of the old Irish Bards which are known traditionally in
Ireland as "The Three Sorrows of Story Telling." It has been told in
verse by Aubrey de Vere ("The Foray of Queen Meave, and Other Legends,"
London, 1882), by John Todhunter ("Three Irish Bardic Tales," London,
1896); and also in prose by various writers, among whom are Professor
Eugene O’Curry, whose version with the Gaelic original was published

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

in "Atlantis," Nos. vii. and viii.; Gerald Griffin in "The Tales of a
Jury Room"; and Dr. Patrick Weston Joyce in "Ancient Celtic Romances"
(London, 1879). The oldest manuscript copy of the tale in Gaelic is one
in the British Museum, made in 1718; but there are more modern ones in
different English and Irish libraries, and the legend itself is of much
older origin. Professor O’Curry, the highest authority, places its date
before the year 1000. ("Lectures on the Manuscript Materials of Irish
History," p. 319.)

### IV. USHEEN

In the original legend, Oisin or Usheen is supposed to have told his
tale to St. Patrick on his arrival in Ireland; but as the ancient Feni
were idolaters, the hero bears but little goodwill to the saint. The
Celtic text of a late form of the legend (1749) with a version by Brian
O’Looney will be found in the transactions of the Ossianic Society for
1856 (Vol. IV. p. 227); and still more modern and less literal
renderings in P. W. Joyce's "Ancient Celtic Romances" (London, 1879), p.
385, and in W. B. Yeats's "Wanderings of Oisin, and Other Poems"
(London, 1889), p. 1. The last is in verse and is much the best. St.
Patrick, who takes part in it, regards Niam as "a demon thing." See also
the essays entitled "L’Elysée Transatlantique," by Eugene Beauvois, in
the "Revue de L’Histoire des Religions," VII. 273 (Paris, 1885), and
"L’Eden Occidental" (same, VII. 673). As to Oisin or Usheen's identity
with Ossian, see O’Curry's "Lectures on the Manuscript Materials for
Ancient Irish History" (Dublin, 1861), pp. 209, 300; John Rhys's
"Hibbert Lectures" (London, 1888), p. 551. The

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

latter thinks the hero identical with Taliessin, as well as with Ossian,
and says that the word Ossin means "a little fawn," from "os," "cervus."
(See also O’Curry, p. 304.) O’Looney represents that it was a stone
which Usheen threw to show his strength, and Joyce follows this view;
but another writer in the same volume of the Ossianic Society
transactions (p. 233) makes it a bag of sand, and Yeats follows this
version. It is also to be added that the latter in later editions
changes the spelling of his hero's name from Oisin to Usheen.

### V. BRAN

The story of Bran and his sister Branwen may be found most fully given
in Lady Charlotte Guest's translation of the "Mabinogion," ed. 1877, pp.
369, 384. She considers Harlech, whence Bran came, to be a locality on
the Welsh seacoast still known by that name and called also Branwen's
Tower. But Rhys, a much higher authority, thinks that Bran came really
from the region of Hades, and therefore from a distant island
("Arthurian Legend," p. 250, "Hibbert Lectures," pp. 94, 269). The name
of "the Blessed" came from the legend of Bran's having introduced
Christianity into Ireland, as stated in one of the Welsh Triads. He was
the father of Caractacus, celebrated for his resistance to the Roman
conquest, and carried a prisoner to Rome. Another triad speaks of King
Arthur as having dug up Bran's head, for the reason that he wished to
hold England by his own strength; whence followed many disasters (Guest,
p. 387).

There were many Welsh legends in regard to Branwen or Bronwen (White
Bosom), and what is supposed to be her

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

grave, with an urn containing her ashes, may still be seen at a place
called "Ynys Bronwen," or "the islet of Bronwen," in Anglesea. It was
discovered and visited in 1813 (Guest, p. 389).

The White Mount in which Bran's head was deposited is supposed to have
been the Tower of London, described by a Welsh poet of the twelfth
century as "The White Eminence of London, a place of splendid fame"
(Guest, p. 392).

### VI. THE CASTLE OF THE ACTIVE DOOR

This legend is mainly taken from different parts of Lady Charlotte
Guest's translation of the "Mabinogion," with some additions and
modifications from Rhys's "Hibbert Lectures" and "The Arthurian Legend."

### VIII. MERLIN

In later years Merlin was known mainly by a series of remarkable
prophecies which were attributed to him and were often said to be
fulfilled by actual events in history. Thus one of the many places where
Merlin's grave was said to be was Drummelzion in Tweeddale, Scotland. On
the east side of the churchyard a brook called the Pansayl falls into
the Tweed, and there was this prophecy as to their union:--

"When Tweed and Pansayl join at Merlin's grave,  
Scotland and England shall one monarch have."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sir Walter Scott
tells us, in his "Border Minstrelsy," that on the day of the coronation
of James VI. of Scotland the Tweed

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

accordingly overflowed and joined the Pansayl at the prophet's grave. It
was also claimed by one of the witnesses at the trial of Jeanne d’Arc,
that there was a prediction by Merlin that France would be saved by a
peasant girl from Lorraine. These prophesies have been often reprinted,
and have been translated into different languages, and there was
published in London, in 1641, "The Life of Merlin, surnamed Ambrosius,
His Prophesies and Predictions interpreted, and their Truth made Good by
our English Annals." Another book was also published in London, in 1683,
called "Merlin revived in a Discourse of Prophesies, Predictions, and
their Remarkable Accomplishments."

### VIII. LANCELOT

The main sources of information concerning Lancelot are the "Morte
d’Arthur," Newell's "King Arthur and the Table Round," and the
publications of the Early English Text Society. See also Rhys's
"Arthurian Legend," pp. 127, 147, etc.

### IX. THE HALF-MAN

The symbolical legend on which this tale is founded will be found in
Lady Charlotte Guest's translation of the "Mabinogion" (London, 1877),
II. p. 344. It is an almost unique instance, in the imaginative
literature of that period, of a direct and avowed allegory. There is
often allegory, but it is usually contributed by modern interpreters,
and would sometimes greatly astound the original fabulists.

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

### X. ARTHUR

The earliest mention of the island of Avalon, or Avilion, in connection
with the death of Arthur, is a slight one by the old English chronicler,
Geoffrey of Monmouth (Book XI. c. 2), and the event is attributed by him
to the year 542. Wace's French romance was an enlargement of Geoffrey;
and the narrative of Layamon (at the close of the twelfth century) an
explanation of that of Wace. Layamon's account of the actual death of
Arthur, as quoted in the text, is to be found in the translation, a very
literal one, by Madden (Madden's "Layamon's Brut," III. pp. 140-146).

The earliest description of the island itself is by an anonymous author
known as "Pseudo-Gildas," supposed to be a thirteenth-century Breton
writer (Meyer's "Voyage of Bram," I. p. 237), and quoted by Archbishop
Usher in his "British Ecclesiastical Antiquities" (1637), p. 273, who
thus describes it in Latin hexameters:--

"Cingitur oceano memorabilis insula nullis  
Desolata bonis: non fur, nec prædo, nec hostis  
Insidiatur ibi: nec vis, nec bruma nec æstas,  
Immoderata furit. Pax et concordia, pubes  
Ver manent æternum. Nec flos, nec lilia desunt,  
Nec rosa, nec violæ: flores et poma sub unâ  
Fronde gerit pomus. Habitant sine labe cruoris  
Semper ibi juvenes cum virgine: nulla senectus,  
Nulla vis morbi, nullus dolor; omnia plena  
Lætitiæ; nihil hic proprium, communia quæque.  
  Regit virgo locis et rebus præsidet istis, <span id="page_236">p.
236</span>  
Virginibus stipata suis, pulcherrima pulchris;  
Nympha decens vultu, generosis patribus orta,  
Consilio pollens, medicinæ nobilis arte.  
At simul Arthurus regni diadema reliquit,  
Substitutique sibi regem, se transtulit illic;  
Anno quingeno quadragenoque secundo  
Post incarnatum sine patris semine natum.  
Immodicè læsus, Arthurus tendit ad aulam  
Regis Avallonis; ubi virgo regia vulnus  
Illius tractans, sanati membra reservat  
Ipsa sibi: vivuntque simul; si credere fas est."

A translation of this passage into rhyming English follows; both of
these being taken from Way's "Fabliaux" (London, 1815), II. pp. 233-235.

"By the main ocean's wave encompass’d, stands  
A memorable isle, fill’d with all good:  
No thief, no spoiler there, no wily foe  
With stratagem of wasteful war; no rage  
Of heat intemperate, or of winter's cold;  
But spring, full blown, with peace and concord reigns:  
Prime bliss of heart and season, fitliest join’d!  
Flowers fail not there: the lily and the rose,  
With many a knot of fragrant violets bound;  
And, loftier, clustering down the bended boughs,  
Blossom with fruit combin’d, rich apples hang.

"Beneath such mantling shades for ever dwell  
In virgin innocence and honour pure,  
Damsels and youths, from age and sickness free, <span id="page_237">p.
237</span>  
And ignorant of woe, and fraught with joy,  
In choice community of all things best.  
  O’er these, and o'er the welfare of this land,  
Girt with her maidens, fairest among fair,  
Reigns a bright virgin sprung from generous sires,  
In counsel strong, and skill’d in med’cine's lore.  
Of her (Britannia's diadem consign’d  
To other brow), for his deep wound and wide  
Great Arthur sought relief: hither he sped  
(Nigh two and forty and five hundred years  
Since came the incarnate Son to save mankind),  
And in Avallon's princely hall repos’d.  
His wound the royal damsel search’d; she heal’d;  
And in this isle still holds him to herself  
In sweet society,--so fame say true!"

### XI. MAELDUIN

This narrative is taken partly from Nutt's "Voyage of Bram" (I. 162) and
partly from Joyce's "Ancient Celtic Romances." The latter, however,
allows Maelduin sixty comrades instead of seventeen, which is Nutt's
version. There are copies of the original narrative in the Erse language
at the British Museum, and in the library of Trinity College, Dublin.
The voyage, which may have had some reality at its foundation, is
supposed to have taken place about the year 700 A.D. It belongs to the
class known as Imrama, or sea-expeditions. Another of these is the
voyage of St. Brandan, and another is that of "the sons of O’Corra." A
poetical translation of this last has been made by T. D. Sullivan of
Dublin, and published

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

in his volume of poems. (Joyce, p. xiii.) All these voyages illustrated
the wider and wider space assigned on the Atlantic ocean to the
enchanted islands until they were finally identified, in some cases,
with the continent which Columbus found.

### XII. ST. BRANDAN

THE legend of St. Brandan, which was very well known in the Middle Ages,
was probably first written in Latin prose near the end of the eleventh
century, and is preserved in manuscript in many English libraries. An
English metrical version, written probably about the beginning of the
fourteenth century, is printed under the editorship of Thomas Wright in
the publications of the Percy Society, London, 1844 (XIV.), and it is
followed in the same volume by an English prose version of 1527. A
partial narrative in Latin prose, with an English version, may be found
in W. J. Rees's "Lives of the Cambro-British Saints" (Llandovery, 1853),
pp. 251, 575. The account of Brandan in the Acta Sanctorum of the
Bollandists may be found under May 16, the work being arranged under
saints' days. This account excludes the more legendary elements. The
best sketch of the supposed island appears in the *Nouvelles Annales des
Voyages* for 1845 (p. 293), by D’Avezac. Professor O’Curry places the
date of the alleged voyage or voyages at about the year 560 ("Lectures
on the Manuscript Materials for Irish History," p. 289). Good accounts
of the life in the great monasteries of Brandan's period may be found in
Digby's "Mores Catholici" or "Ages of Faith"; in Montalembert's "Monks
of the West" (translation); in Villemarqué's "La Legende Celtique et la
Poésie des Cloistres en Irlande, en Cambrie et en Bretagne" (Paris,

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 1864). The poem on
St. Brandan, stanzas from which are quoted in the text, is by Denis
Florence McCarthy, and may be found in the *Dublin University Magazine*
(XXXI. p. 89); and there is another poem on the subject--a very foolish
burlesque--in the same magazine (LXXXIX. p. 471). Matthew Arnold's poem
with the same title appeared in *Fraser's Magazine* (LXII. p. 133), and
may be found in the author's collected works in the form quoted below.

The legends of St. Brandan, it will be observed, resemble so much the
tales of Sindbad the Sailor and others in the "Arabian Nights"--which
have also the island-whale, the singing birds, and other features--that
it is impossible to doubt that some features of tradition were held in
common with the Arabs of Spain.

In later years (the twelfth century), a geographer named Honoré d’Autun
declared, in his "Image of the World," that there was in the ocean a
certain island agreeable and fertile beyond all others, now unknown to
men, once discovered by chance and then lost again, and that this island
was the one which Brandan had visited. In several early maps, before the
time of Columbus, the Madeira Islands appear as "The Fortunate Islands
of St. Brandan," and on the famous globe of Martin Behaim, made in the
very year when Columbus sailed, there is a large island much farther
west than Madeira, and near the equator, with an inscription saying that
in the year 565, St. Brandan arrived at this island and saw many
wondrous things, returning to his own land afterwards. Columbus heard
this island mentioned at Ferro, where men declared that they had seen it
in the distance. Later, the chart of Ortelius, in the sixteenth century,
carried it to the neighborhood of Ireland;

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

then it was carried south again, and was supposed all the time to change
its place through enchantment, and when Emanuel of Portugal, in 1519,
renounced all claim to it, he described it as "The Hidden Island." In
1570 a Portuguese expedition was sent which claimed actually to have
touched the mysterious island, indeed to have found there the vast
impression of a human foot--doubtless of the baptized giant Mildus--and
also a cross nailed to a tree, and three stones laid in a triangle for
cooking food. Departing hastily from the island, they left two sailors
behind, but could never find the place again.

Again and again expeditions were sent out in search of St. Brandan's
island, usually from the Canaries--one in 1604 by Acosta, one in 1721 by
Dominguez; and several sketches of the island, as seen from a distance,
were published in 1759 by a Franciscan priest in the Canary Islands,
named Viere y Clarijo, including one made by himself on May 3, 1759,
about 6 A.M., in presence of more than forty witnesses. All these
sketches depict the island as having its chief length from north to
south, and formed of two unequal hills, the highest of these being at
the north, they having between them a depression covered with trees. The
fact that this resembles the general form of Palma, one of the Canary
Islands, has led to the belief that it may have been an ocean mirage,
reproducing the image of that island, just as the legends themselves
reproduce, here and there, the traditions of the "Arabian Nights."

In a map drawn by the Florentine physician, Toscanelli, which was sent
by him to Columbus in 1474 to give his impression of the Asiatic
coast,--lying, as he supposed, across the Atlantic,--there appears the
island of St. Brandan. It is as large as all the Azores or Canary
Islands or Cape de Verde Islands

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

put together; its southern tip just touches the equator, and it lies
about half-way between the Cape de Verde Islands and Zipangu or Japan,
which was then believed to lie on the other side of the Atlantic. Mr.
Winsor also tells us that the apparition of this island "sometimes came
to sailors' eyes" as late as the last century (Winsor's "Columbus,"
112).

He also gives a reproduction of Toscanelli's map now lost, as far as can
be inferred from descriptions (Winsor, p. 110).

The following is Matthew Arnold's poem:--

    SAINT BRANDAN

Saint Brandan sails the northern main;  
The brotherhoods of saints are glad.  
He greets them once, he sails again;  
So late!--such storms!--the Saint is mad!

He heard, across the howling seas,  
Chime convent-bells on wintry nights;  
He saw, on spray-swept Hebrides,  
Twinkle the monastery lights;

But north, still north, Saint Brandan steer’d--  
And now no bells, no convents more!  
The hurtling Polar lights are near’d,  
The sea without a human shore.

At last--(it was the Christmas-night;  
Stars shone after a day of storm)--  
He sees float past an iceberg white,  
And on it--Christ!--a living form. <span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

That furtive mien, that scowling eye,  
Of hair that red and tufted fell--  
It is--oh, where shall Brandan fly?--  
The traitor Judas, out of hell!

Palsied with terror, Brandan sate;  
The moon was bright, the iceberg near.  
He hears a voice sigh humbly: "Wait!  
By high permission I am here.

"One moment wait, thou holy man!  
On earth my crime, my death, they knew;  
My name is under all men's ban--  
Ah, tell them of my respite, too!

"Tell them, one blessed Christmas-night--  
(It was the first after I came,  
Breathing self-murder, frenzy, spite,  
To rue my guilt in endless flame)--

"I felt, as I in torment lay  
'Mid the souls plagued by heavenly power,  
An angel touch my arm and say:  
*Go hence, and cool thyself an hour!* 

"'Ah, whence this mercy, Lord?' I said;  
*The Leper recollect*, said he,  
*Who ask’d the passers-by for aid,*  
*In Joppa, and thy charity*. <span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

"Then I remember’d how I went,  
In Joppa, through the public street,  
One morn when the sirocco spent  
Its storm of dust with burning heat;

"And in the street a leper sate,  
Shivering with fever, naked, old;  
Sand raked his sores from heel to pate,  
The hot wind fever’d him five-fold.

"He gazed upon me as I pass’d,  
And murmur’d: *Help me, or I die!*--  
To the poor wretch my cloak I cast,  
Saw him look eased, and hurried by.

"Oh, Brandan, think what grace divine,  
What blessing must full goodness shower,  
When fragment of it small, like mine,  
Hath such inestimable power!

"Well-fed, well-clothed, well-friended, I  
Did that chance act of good, that one!  
Then went my way to kill and lie--  
Forgot my good as soon as done.

"That germ of kindness, in the womb  
Of mercy caught, did not expire;  
Outlives my guilt, outlives my doom,  
And friends me in this pit of fire. <span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

"Once every year, when carols wake  
On earth the Christmas-night's repose,  
Arising from the sinner's lake,  
I journey to these healing snows.

"I stanch with ice my burning breast,  
With silence balm my whirling brain;  
O Brandan! to this hour of rest  
That Joppan leper's ease was pain."

Tears started to Saint Brandan's eyes;  
He bow’d his head, he breathed a prayer--  
Then look’d, and lo, the frosty skies!  
The iceberg, and no Judas there!

The island of St. Brandan's was sometimes supposed to lie in the
Northern Atlantic, sometimes farther south. It often appears as the
Fortunate Isle or Islands, "Insulæ Fortunatæ" or "Beatæ."

On some early maps (1306 to 1471) there is an inlet on the western coast
of Ireland called "Lacus Fortunatus," which is filled with Fortunate
Islands to the number of 358 (Humboldt, "Examen," II. p. 159), and in
one map of 1471 both these and the supposed St. Brandan's group appear
in different parts of the ocean under the same name. When the Canary
Islands were discovered, they were supposed to be identical with St.
Brandan's, but the latter was afterwards supposed to lie southeast of
them. After the discovery of the Azores various expeditions were sent to
search for St. Brandan's until about 1721. It was last reported as seen
in 1759. A full bibliography

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

will be found in Winsor's "Narrative and Critical History," I. p. 48,
and also in Humboldt's "Examen," II. p. 163, and early maps containing
St. Brandan's will be found in Winsor (I. pp. 54, 58). The first of
these is Pizigani's (1387), containing "Ysolæ dictæ Fortunatæ," and the
other that of Ortelius (1587), containing "S. Brandain."

### XIII. HY-BRASAIL

"The people of Aran, with characteristic enthusiasm, fancy, that at
certain periods, they see *Hy-Brasail*, elevated far to the west in
their watery horizon. This has been the universal tradition of the
ancient Irish, who supposed that a great part of Ireland had been
swallowed by the sea, and that the sunken part often rose and was seen
hanging in the horizon: such was the popular notion. The Hy-Brasail of
the Irish is evidently a part of the Atlantis of Plato; who, in his
'Timæus,' says that that island was totally swallowed up by a prodigious
earthquake." (O’Flaherty's "Discourse on the History and Antiquities of
the Southern Islands of Aran, lying off the West Coast of Ireland,"
1824, p. 139.)

The name appeared first (1351) on the chart called the Medicean
Portulana, applied to an island off the Azores. In Pizigani's map (1367)
there appear three islands of this name, two off the Azores and one off
Ireland. From this time the name appears constantly in maps, and in 1480
a man named John Jay went out to discover the island on July 14, and
returned unsuccessful on September 18. He called it Barsyle or Brasylle;
and Pedro d’Ayalo, the Spanish Ambassador, says that such voyages were
made for seven years "according to the

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

fancies of the Genoese, meaning Sebastian Cabot." Humboldt thinks that
the wood called Brazil-wood was supposed to have come from it, as it was
known before the South American Brazil was discovered.

A manuscript history of Ireland, written about 1636, in the Library of
the Royal Irish Academy, says that Hy-Brasail was discovered by a
Captain Rich, who saw its harbor but could never reach it. It is
mentioned by Jeremy Taylor ("Dissuasives from Popery," 1667), and the
present narrative is founded partly on an imaginary one, printed in a
pamphlet in London, 1675, and reprinted in Hardiman's "Irish Minstrelsy"
(1831), II. p. 369. The French Geographer Royal, M. Tassin, thinks that
the island may have been identical with Porcupine Bank, once above
water. In Jeffrey's atlas (1776) it appears as "the imaginary island of
O’Brasil." "Brazil Rock" appears on a chart of Purdy, 1834 (Humboldt's
"Examen Critique," II. p. 163). Two rocks always associated with it,
Mayda and Green Rock, appear on an atlas issued in 1866. See
bibliography in Winsor's "Narrative and Critical History," I. p. 49,
where there are a number of maps depicting it (I. pp. 54-57). The name
of the island is derived by Celtic scholars from *breas*, large, and
*i*, island; or, according to O'Brien's "Irish Dictionary," its other
form of O’Brasile means a large imaginary island (Hardiman's "Irish
Minstrelsy," I. p. 369). There are several families named Brazil in
County Waterford, Ireland ("Transactions of the Ossianic Society,
Dublin," 1854, I. p. 81). The following poem about the island, by Gerald
Griffin, will be found in Sparling's "Irish Minstrelsy" (1888), p.
427:--

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

    HY-BRASAIL, THE ISLE OF THE BLEST

On the ocean that hollows the rocks where ye dwell  
A shadowy land has appeared, as they tell;  
Men thought it a region of sunshine and rest,  
And they called it Hy-Brasail, the isle of the blest.  
From year unto year on the ocean's blue rim,  
The beautiful spectre showed lovely and dim;  
The golden clouds curtained the deep where it lay,  
And it looked like an Eden away, far away!

A peasant who heard of the wonderful tale,  
In the breeze of the Orient loosened his sail;  
From Ara, the holy, he turned to the west,  
For though Ara was holy, Hy-Brasail was blest.  
He heard not the voices that called from the shore--  
He heard not the rising wind's menacing roar;  
Home, kindred, and safety he left on that day,  
And he sped to Hy-Brasail, away, far away!

Morn rose on the deep, and that shadowy isle,  
O'er the faint rim of distance, reflected its smile;  
Noon burned on the wave, and that shadowy shore  
Seemed lovelily distant, and faint as before;  
Lone evening came down on the wanderer's track,  
And to Ara again he looked timidly back;  
O far on the verge of the ocean it lay,  
Yet the isle of the blest was away, far away! <span id="page_248">p.

Rash dreamer, return! O ye winds of the main,  
Bear him back to his own peaceful Ara again,  
Rash fool! for a vision of fanciful bliss,  
To barter thy calm life of labor and peace.  
The warning of reason was spoken in vain;  
He never revisited Ara again!  
Night fell on the deep, amidst tempest and spray,  
And he died on the waters, away, far away!

### XIV. ISLAND OF SATAN'S HAND

The early part of this narrative is founded on Professor O’Curry's
Lectures on the manuscript materials of Irish history; it being another
of those "Imrama" or narratives of ocean expeditions to which the tale
of St. Brandan belongs. The original narrative lands the three brothers
ultimately in Spain, and it is a curious fact that most of what we know
of the island of Satanaxio or Satanajio--which remained so long on the
maps--is taken from an Italian narrative of three other brothers, cited
by Formaleoni, "Il Pellegrinaccio di tre giovanni," by Christoforo
Armeno (Gaffarel, "Les Iles Fantastiques," p. 91). The coincidence is so
peculiar that it offered an irresistible temptation to link the two
trios of brothers into one narrative and let the original voyagers do
the work of exploration. The explanation given by Gaffarel to the tale
is the same that I have suggested as possible. He says in "Iles
Fantastiques de l’Atlantaque" (p. 12), "S’il nous était permis
d’aventurer une hypothèse, nous croirions voluntiers que les navigateurs
de l’époque rencontrèrent, en s’aventurant dans l’Atlantique,
quelques-uns de ces gigantesques icebergs, ou montagnes de

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

glace, arrachés aux banquises du pôle nord, et entraînés au sud par les
courants, dont la rencontre, assez fréquente, est, même aujourd’hui,
tellement redoutée par les capitaines. Ces icebergs, quand ils se
heurtent contre un navire, le coulent à pic; et comme ils arrivent à
l’improviste, escortés par d’épais brouillards, ils paraissent
réellement sortir du sein des flots, comme sortait la main de Satan,
pour précipiter au fond de l’abîme matelots et navires." As to the name
itself there has been much discussion. On the map of Bianco
(1436)--reproduced in Winsor, I. p. 54--the name "Ya de Lamansatanaxio"
distinctly appears, and this was translated by both Formaleoni and
Humboldt as meaning "the Island of the Hand of Satan." D'Avezac was the
first to suggest that the reference was to two separate islands, the one
named "De la Man" or "Danman," and the other "Satanaxio." He further
suggests--followed by Gaffarel--that the name of the island may
originally have been San Atanagio, thus making its baptism a tribute to
St. Athanasius instead of to Satan. This would certainly have been a
curious transformation, and almost as unexpected in its way as the
original conversion of the sinful brothers from outlaws to missionaries.

### XV. ANTILLIA

The name Antillia appears first, but not very clearly, on the Pizigani
map of 1367; then clearly on a map of 1424, preserved at Weimar, on that
of Bianco in 1436, and on the globe of Beheim in 1492, which adds in an
inscription the story of the Seven Bishops. On some maps of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there appears near it a smaller
island under

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

the name of Sette Cidade, or Sete Ciudades, which is properly another
name for the same island. Toscanelli, in his famous letter to Columbus,
recommended Antillia as a good way-station for his voyage to India. The
island is said by tradition to have been re-discovered by a Portuguese
sailor in 1447. Tradition says that this sailor went hastily to the
court of Portugal to announce the discovery, but was blamed for not
having remained longer, and so fled. It was supposed to be "a large,
rectangular island extending from north to south, lying in the mid
Atlantic about lat. 35 N." An ample bibliography will be found in
Winsor's "Narrative and Critical History," I. p. 48, with maps
containing Antillia, I. pp. 54 (Pizigani's), 56, 58.

After the discovery of America, Peter Martyr states (in 1493) that
Hispaniola and the adjacent islands were "Antillæ insulæ," meaning that
they were identical with the group surrounding the fabled Antillia
(Winsor's "Narrative and Critical History," I. p. 49); and Schöner, in
the dedicatory letter of his globe of 1523, says that the king of
Castile, through Columbus, has discovered *Antiglias Hispaniam Cubam
quoque*. It was thus that the name Antilles came to be applied to the
islands discovered by Columbus; just as the name Brazil was transferred
from an imaginary island to the new continent, and the name Seven Cities
was applied to the pueblos of New Mexico by those who discovered them.
(See J. H. Simpson, "Coronado's March in Search of the Seven Cities of
Cibola," Smithsonian Institution, 1869, pp. 209-340.)

The sailor who re-discovered them said that the chief desire of the
people was to know whether the Moors still held Spain (Gaffarel, "Iles
Fantastiques," p. 3). In a copy of "Ptolemy"

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

addressed to Pope Urban VI. about 1380, before the alleged visit of the
Portuguese, it was stated of the people at Antillia that they lived in a
Christian manner, and were most prosperous, "Hic populus christianissime
vivit, omnibus divitiis seculi hujus plenus" (D’Avezac, "Nouvelles
Annales des voyages," 1845, II. p. 55).

It was afterwards held by some that the island of Antillia was identical
with St. Michael in the Azores, where a certain cluster of stone huts
still bears the name of Seven Cities, and the same name is associated
with a small lake by which they stand. (Humboldt's "Examen Critique,"
Paris, 1837, II. p. 203; Gaffarel, "Iles Fantastiques," p. 3.)

### XVI. HARALD THE VIKING

The tales of the Norse explorations of America are now accessible in
many forms, the most convenient of these being in the edition of E. L.
Slafter, published by the Prince Society. As to the habits of the
Vikings, the most accessible authorities are "The Age of the Vikings,"
by Du Chaillu, and "The Sea Kings of Norway," by Laing. The writings of
the late Professor E. N. Horsford are well known, but his opinions are
not yet generally accepted by students. His last work, "Leif's House in
Vineland," with his daughter's supplementary essay on "Graves of the
Northmen," is probably the most interesting of the series (Boston,
1893). In Longfellow's "Saga of King Olaf" (II.), included in "Tales of
a Wayside Inn," there is a description of the athletic sports practised
by the Vikings, which are moreover described with the greatest
minuteness by Du Chaillu.

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

### XVII. NORUMBEGA

The narrative of Champlain's effort to find Norumbega in 1632 may be
found in Otis's "Voyages of Champlain" (II. p. 38), and there is another
version in the *Magazine of American History* (I. p. 321). The whole
legend of the city is well analyzed in the same magazine (I. p. 14) by
Dr. De Costa under the title "The Lost City of New England." In another
volume he recurs to the subject (IX. p. 168), and gives (IX. p. 200) a
printed copy of David Ingram's narrative, from the original in the
Bodleian Library. He also discusses the subject in Winsor's "Narrative
and Critical History" (IV. p. 77, etc.), where he points out that "the
insular character of the Norumbega region is not purely imaginary, but
is based on the fact that the Penobscot region affords a continued
watercourse to the St. Lawrence, which was travelled by the Maine
Indians." Ramusio's map of 1559 represents "Nurumbega" as a large
island, well defined (Winsor, IV. p. 91); and so does that of Ruscelli
(Winsor, IV. p. 92), the latter spelling it "Nurumberg." Some
geographers supposed it to extend as far as Florida. The name was also
given to a river (probably the Penobscot) and to a cape. The following
is Longfellow's poem on the voyage of Sir Humphrey Gilbert:--

  SIR HUMPHREY GILBERT

Southward with fleet of ice  
  Sailed the corsair Death;  
Wild and fast blew the blast,  
  And the east-wind was his breath. <span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

His lordly ships of ice  
  Glisten in the sun;  
On each side, like pennons wide,  
  Flashing crystal streamlets run.

His sails of white sea-mist  
  Dripped with silver rain;  
But where he passed there were cast  
  Leaden shadows o’er the main.

Eastward from Campobello  
  Sir Humphrey Gilbert sailed;  
Three days or more seaward he bore,  
  Then, alas! the land-wind failed.

Alas! the land-wind failed,  
  And ice-cold grew the night;  
And nevermore, on sea or shore,  
  Should Sir Humphrey see the light.

He sat upon the deck,  
  The Book was in his hand;  
"Do not fear! Heaven is as near,"  
  He said, "by water as by land!"

In the first watch of the night,  
  Without a signal's sound,  
Out of the sea, mysteriously,  
  The fleet of Death rose all around. <span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

The moon and the evening star  
  Were hanging in the shrouds;  
Every mast, as it passed,  
  Seemed to rake the passing clouds.

They grappled with their prize,  
  At midnight black and cold!  
As of a rock was the shock;  
  Heavily the ground-swell rolled.

Southward through day and dark,  
  They drift in close embrace,  
With mist and rain, o'er the open main;  
  Yet there seems no change of place.

Southward, forever southward,  
  They drift through dark and day;  
And like a dream, in the Gulf-Stream  
  Sinking, vanish all away.

### XVIII. GUARDIANS OF THE ST. LAWRENCE

For authorities for this tale see "Voyages of Samuel de Champlain,"
translated by Charles Pomeroy Otis, Ph.D., with memoir by the Rev. E. F.
Slafter, A.M., Boston, 1880 (I. pp. 116, 289, II. p. 52). The incident
of the disguised Indians occurred, however, to the earlier explorer,
Jacques Cartier. (See my "Larger History of the United States," p. 112.)

### XIX. ISLAND OF DEMONS

The tale of the Isle of Demons is founded on a story told first by
Marguerite of Navarre in her "Heptameron" (LXVII. Nouvelle), and then
with much variation and amplification by the very untrustworthy
traveller Thevet in his "Cosmographie" (1571), Livre XXIII. c. vi. The
only copy of the latter work known to me is in the Carter-Brown Library
at Providence, R.I., and the passage has been transcribed for me through
the kindness of A. E. Winship, Esq., librarian, who has also sent me a
photograph of a woodcut representing the lonely woman shooting at a
bear. A briefer abstract of the story is in Winsor's "Narrative and
Critical History" (IV. p. 66, note), but it states, perhaps erroneously,
that Thevet knew Marguerite only through the Princess of Navarre,
whereas that author claims--though his claim is never worth much--that
he had the story from the poor woman herself, "*La pauvre femme estant
arriuvee en France . . . et venue en la ville de Nautron, pays de
Perigort lors que i’y estois, me feit le discours de toutes ses fortunes
passées*."

The Island of Demons appears on many old maps which may be found
engraved in Winsor, IV. pp. 91, 92, 93, 100, 373, etc.; also as "Isla de
demonios" in Sebastian Cabot's map (1544) reprinted in Dr. S. E.
Dawson's valuable "Voyages of the Cabots," in the Transactions of the
Royal Society of Canada for 1897. He also gives Ruysch's map (1508), in
which a cluster of islands appears in the same place, marked "Insulæ
dæmonum." Harrisse, in his "Notes sur la Nouvelle France" (p. 278),
describes the three sufferers as having been abandoned

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

by Roberval *à trente six lieues des côtes de Canada, dans une isle
deserte qui fut depuis désignée sous le nom de l’Isle de la Demoiselle,
pres de l’embouchure de la Rivière St. Paul ou des Saumons*. I have not,
however, been able to identify this island. Parkman also says ("Pioneers
of France," p. 205) that Roberval's pilot, in his *routier*, or logbook,
speaks often of "Les Isles de la Demoiselle," evidently referring to
Marguerite. The brief account by the Princess of Navarre follows:--

LXVII<sup>E</sup> NOUVELLE

Une pauvre femme, pour sauver la vie de son mary, hasarda la sienne, et
ne l’abandonna jusqu’à la mort.

C’est que faisant le dict Robertval un voiage sur la mer, duquel il
estoit chef par le commandement du Roy son maistre, en l’isle de
Canadas; auquel lieu avoit délibéré, si l’air du païs euste esté
commode, de demourer et faire villes et chasteaulx; en quoy il fit tel
commencement, que chacun peut sçavoir. Et, pour habituer le pays de
Chrestiens, mena avecq luy de toutes sortes d’artisans, entre lesquelz y
avoit un homme, qui fut si malheureux, qu’il trahit son maistre et le
mist en dangier d’estre prins des gens du pays. Mais Dieu voulut que son
entreprinse fut si tost congneue, qu’elle ne peut nuyre au cappitaine
Robertval, lequel feit prendre ce meschant traistre, le voulant pugnir
comme il l’avoit mérité; ce qui eust esté faict, sans sa femme qui avoit
suivy son mary par les périlz de la mer; et ne le voulut abandonner à la
mort, mais avecq force larmes feit tant, avecq le cappitaine et toute la
compaignye, que, tant pour la pitié d’icelle que pour le service qu’elle
leur avoit faict, luy accorda sa requeste qui fut telle, que le mary et
la femme furent

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

laissez en une petite isle, sur la mer, où il n’habitoit que bestes
saulvaiges; et leur fut permis de porter avecq eulx ce dont ilz avoient
nécessité. Les pauvres gens, se trouvans tous seulz en la compaignye des
bestes saulvaiges et cruelles, n’eurent recours que à Dieu seul, qui
avoit esté toujours le ferme espoir de ceste pauvre femme. Et, comme
celle qui avoit toute consolation en Dieu, porta pour sa saulve garde,
nourriture et consolation le Nouveau Testament, lequel elle lisoit
incessamment. Et, au demourant, avecq son mary, mettoit peine
d’accoustrer un petit logis le mieulx qui’l leur estoit possible; et,
quand les lyons et aultres bestes en aprochoient pour les dévorer, le
mary avecq sa harquebuze, et elle, avecq les pierres, se défendoient si
bien, que, non suellement les bestes ne les osoient approcher, mais bien
souvent en tuèrent de très-bonnes à manger; ainsy, avecq telles chairs
et les herbes du païs, vesquirent quelque temps, quand le pain leur fut
failly. A la longue, le mary ne peut porter telle nourriture; et, à
cause des eaues qu’ilz buvoient, devint si enflé, que en peu de temps il
mourut, n’aiant service ne consolation que sa femme, laquelle le servoit
de médecin et de confesseur; en sorte qu’il passa joieusement de ce
désert en la céleste patrie. Et la pauvre femme, demourée seulle,
l’enterra le plus profond en terre qu’il fut possible; si est-ce que les
bestes en eurent incontinent le sentyment, qui vindrent pour manger la
charogne. Mais la pauvre femme, en sa petite maisonnette, de coups de
harquebuze défendoit que la chair de son mary n’eust tel sépulchre.
Ainsy vivant, quant au corps, de vie bestiale, et quant à l’esperit, de
vie angélicque, passoit son temps en lectures, contemplations, prières
et oraisons ayant un esperit joieux et content, dedans un corps emmaigry
et demy mort. Mais Celluy qui n’abandonne jamais les siens, et qui, au
désespoir

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

des autres, monstre sa puissance, ne permist que la vertu qu’il avoit
myse en ceste femme fust ignorée des hommes, mais voulut qu’elle fust
congneue à sa gloire; et fiet que, au bout de quelque temps, un des
navires de ceste armée passant devant ceste isle, les gens qui estoient
dedans advisèrent, quelque fumée qui leur feit souvenir de ceulx qui y
avoient esté laissez, et délibérèrent d’aller veoir ce que Dieu en avoit
faict. La pauvre femme, voiant approcher el navire, se tira au bort de
la mer, auquel lieu la trouvèrent à leur arrivée. Et, après en avoir
rendu louange à Dieu, les mena en sa pauvre maisonnette, et leur monstra
de quoy elle vivoit durant sa demeure; ce que leur eust esté incroiable,
sans la congnoissance qu’ilz avoient que Dieu est puissant de nourrir en
un désert ses serviteurs, comme au plus grandz festins du monde. Et, ne
pouvant demeurer en tel lieu, emmenèrent la pauvre femme avecq eulx
droict à la Rochelle, où, après un navigage, ilz arrivèrent. Et quand
ilz eurent faict entendre aux habitans la fidélité et persévérance de
ceste femme, elle fut receue à grand honneur de toutes les Dames, qui
voluntiers luy baillèrent leurs filles pour aprendre à lire et à
escripre. Et, à cest honneste mestier-là, gaigna le surplus de sa vie,
n’aiant autre désîr que d’exhorter un chaucun à l’amour et confiance de
Nostre Seigneur, se proposant pour exemple la grande miséricorde dont il
avoit usé envers elle.

### XX. BIMINI

Parkman says expressly that "Ponce de Léon found the Island of Bimini,"
but it is generally mentioned as having been imaginary, and is not
clearly identified among the three thousand islands and rocks of the
Bahamas. Peter Martyr placed the

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Fountain of Youth
in Florida, which he may have easily supposed to be an island. Some of
the features of my description are taken from the strange voyage of
Cabeza da Vaca, which may be read in Buckingham Smith's translation of
his narrative (Washington, D.C., 1851), or in a more condensed form in
Henry Kingsley's "Tales of Old Travel," or in my own "Book of American
Explorers" (N.Y., Longmans, 1894).
