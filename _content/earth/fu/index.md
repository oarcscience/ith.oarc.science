One of the perennial pre-Columbian contact theories involves ancient
visits by the Chinese to America. This is made plausible for several
reasons. First of all, the voyage around the great circle route across
the Pacific is facilitated by almost constant visibility of land and
prevailing sea-currents. China had advanced maritime technology long
before the European age of discovery, and historically were known to
have taken long sea voyages to distant ports such as Africa, Arabia and
India before Vasco de Gamma set sail. And lastly, there are suggestive
Chinese accounts of lands far to the East in their chronicles. This
book, written in the 19th century by Charles Leland, examines these
records, and also reviews some of the evidence for such contacts.

This has remained a popular hypothesis to the current day. For instance,
[1421 :The Year China Discovered
America](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006054094X/internetsacredte),
by Gavin Menzies, and [Voyages of the Pyramid
Builders](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1585423203/internetsacredte),
by Jeremy P. Tarcher, are two recent books which propose pre-Columbian
voyages from China to the New World. However, Leland's Fusang explored
this concept over a century ago, and is required reading if you have any
interest in this topic.
