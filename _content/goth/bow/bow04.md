IN Norway and Iceland certain men were said to be *eigi einhamir*, not
of one skin, an idea which had its roots in paganism. The full form of
this strange superstition was, that men could take upon them other
bodies, and the natures of those beings whose bodies they assumed. The
second adopted shape was called by the same name as the original shape,
*hamr*, and the expression made use of to designate the transition from
one body to another, was at *skipta hömum*, or *at hamaz*; whilst the
expedition made in the second form, was the hamför. By this
transfiguration extraordinary powers were acquired; the natural strength
of the individual was doubled, or quadrupled; he acquired the strength

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

of the beast in whose body he travelled, in addition to his own, and a
man thus invigorated was called *hamrammr*.

The manner in which the change was effected, varied. At times, a dress
of skin was cast over the body, and at once the transformation was
complete; at others, the human body was deserted, and the soul entered
the second form, leaving the first body in a cataleptic state, to all
appearance dead. The second hamr was either borrowed or created for the
purpose. There was yet a third manner of producing this effect-it was by
incantation; but then the form of the individual remained unaltered,
though the eyes of all beholders were charmed so that they could only
perceive him under the selected form.

Having assumed some bestial shape, the man who is *eigi einhammr* is
only to be recognized by his eyes, which by no power can be changed. He
then pursues his course, follows the instincts of the beast whose body
he has taken, yet without quenching his own intelligence. He is able to
do what the body of the animal can do, and do what he, as man, can do as
well. He may fly or swim, if be is in the shape of bird or fish; if he
has taken the form of a wolf, or if he

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

goes on a *gandreið*, or wolf's-ride, he is fall of the rage and
malignity of the creatures whose powers and passions he has assumed.

I will give a few instances of each of the three methods of changing
bodies mentioned above. Freyja and Frigg had their falcon dresses in
which they visited different regions of the earth, and Loki is said to
have borrowed these, and to have then appeared so precisely like a
falcon, that he would have escaped detection, but for the malicious
twinkle of his eyes. In the Vælundar kviða is the following passage:--

The introduction of Sœmund tells us that these charming young ladies
were caught when they had laid their swan-skins beside them on the
shore, and were consequently not in a condition to fly.

In like manner were wolves' dresses used. The following curious passage
is from the wild Saga of the Völsungs:--

"It is now to be told that Sigmund thought Sinfjötli too young to help
him in his revenge, and he wished first to test his powers; so during
the summer they plunged deep into the wood and slew men for their goods,
and Sigmund saw that he was quite of the Völsung stock. . . . Now it
fell out that as they went through the forest, collecting monies, that
they lighted on a house in which were two men sleeping, with great gold
rings an them; they had dealings with witchcraft, for wolf-skins hung up
in the house above them; it was the tenth day on which they might come
out of their second state. They were kings' sons. Sigmund and Sinfjötli
got into the habits, and could not get out of them again, and the nature
of the original beasts came over them, and they howled as wolves--they
learned "both of them to howl. Now they went into the forest, and each
took his own

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

course; they made the agreement together that they should try their
strength against as many as seven men, but not more, and. that he who
was ware of strife should utter his wolf's howl.

"'Do not fail in this,' said Sigmund, 'for you are young and daring, and
men would be glad to chase you.' Now each went his own course; and after
that they had parted Sigmund found men, so he howled; and when Sinfjötli
heard that, he ran up and slew them all-then they separated. And
Sinfjötli had not been long in the wood before he met with. eleven men;
he fell upon them and slew them every one. Then he was tired, so he
flung himself under an oak to rest. Up came Sigmund and said, 'Why did
you not call out?' Sinfjötli replied, 'What was the need of asking your
help to kill eleven men?'

"Sigmund flew at him and rent him so that he fell, for he had bitten
through his throat. That day they could not leave their wolf-forms.
Sigmund laid him on his back and bare him home to the hall, and sat
beside him, and said, 'Deuce take the wolf-forms!"'--Völsung Saga, c. 8.

There is another curious story of a were-wolf in the same Saga, which I
must relate.

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

"Now he did as she requested, and hewed down a great piece of timber,
and cast it across the feet of those ten brothers seated in a row, in
the forest; and there they sat all that day and on till night. And at
midnight there came an old she-wolf out of the forest to them, as they
sat in the stocks, and she was both huge and grimly. Now she fell upon
one of them, and bit him to death, and after she had eaten him all up,
she went away. And next morning Signy sent a trusty man to her brothers,
to know how it had fared with them. When he returned he told her of the
death of one, and that grieved her much, for she feared it might fare
thus with them all, and she would be unable to assist them.

"In short, nine nights following came the same she-wolf at midnight, and
devoured them one after another till all were dead, except Sigmund, and
he was left alone. So when the tenth night came, Signy sent her trusty
man to Sigmund, her brother, with honey in his hand, and said that he
was to smear it over the face of Sigmund, and to fill his mouth with it.
Now he went to Sigmund, and did as he was bid, after which he returned
home. And during the night came the same she-wolf, as was her wont, and
reckoned to devour him, like his brothers.

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

"Now she snuffed at him, where the honey was smeared, and began to lick
his face with her tongue, and presently thrust her tongue into his
mouth. He bore it ill, and bit into the tongue of the she-wolf; she
sprang up and tried to break loose, setting her feet against the stock,
so as to snap it asunder: but he held firm, and ripped the tongue out by
the roots, so that it was the death of the wolf. It is the opinion of
some men that this beast was the mother of King Siggeir, and that she
had taken this form upon her through devilry and witchcraft."--(c. 5.)

There is another story bearing on the subject in the Hrolfs Saga Kraka,
which is pretty; it is as follows:--

"In the north of Norway, in upland-dales, reigned a king called Hring;
and he had a son named Björn. Now it fell out that the queen died, much
lamented by the king, and by all. The people advised him to marry again,
and so be sent men south to get him a wife. A gale and fierce storm fell
upon them, so that they had to turn the helm, and run before the wind,
and so they came north to Finnmark, where they spent the winter. One day
they went inland, and came to a house in which sat two beautiful women,
who greeted them well, and

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

inquired whence they had come. They replied by giving an account of
their journey and their errand, and then asked the women who they were,
and why they were alone, and far from the haunts of men, although they
were so comely and engaging. The elder replied--that her name was
Ingibjorg, and that her daughter was called Hvit, and that she was the
Finn king's sweetheart. The messengers decided that they would return
home, if Hvit would come with them and marry King Hring. She agreed, and
they took her with them and met the king who was pleased with her, and
had his wedding feast made, and said that he cared not though she was
not rich. But the king was very old, and that the queen soon found out.

"There was a Carle who had a farm not far from the king's dwelling; he
had a wife, and a daughter, who was but a child, and her name was Bera;
she was very young and lovely. Björn the king's son, and Bera the
Carle's daughter, were wont, as children, to play together, and they
loved each other well. The Carle was well to do, he had been out
harrying in his young days, and he was a doughty champion. Björn and
Bera loved each other more and more, and they were often together.

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

Time passed, and nothing worth relating occurred; but Björn, the king's
son, waxed strong and tall; and he was well skilled in all manly
exercises.

"King Hring was often absent for long, harrying foreign shores, and Hvit
remained at home and governed the land. She was not liked of the people.
She was always very pleasant with Björn, but he cared little for her. It
fell out once that the King Hring went abroad, and he spake with his
queen that Björn should remain at home with her, to assist in the
government, for he thought it advisable, the queen being haughty and
inflated with pride.

"The king told his son Björn that he was to remain at home, and rule the
land with the queen; Björn replied that he disliked the plan, and that
he had no love for the queen; but the king was inflexible, and left the
land with a great following. Björn walked home after his conversation
with the king, and went up to his place, ill-pleased and red as blood.
The queen came to speak with him, and to cheer him; and spake friendly
with him, but he bade her be of. She obeyed him that time. She often
came to talk with him, and said how much pleasanter it was for them to
be together, than to have an old fellow like Hring in the house.

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

"Björn resented this speech, and struck her a box in the ear, and bade
her depart, and he spurned her from him. She replied that this was
ill-done to drive and thrust her away: and 'You think it better, Björn,
to sweetheart a Carle's daughter, than to have my love and favour, a
fine piece of condescension and a disgrace it is to you! But, before
long, something will stand in the way of your fancy, and your folly.'
Then she struck at him with a wolf-skin glove, and said, that he should
become a rabid and grim wild bear; and 'You shall eat nothing but your
father's sheep, which you shall slay for your food, and never shall you
leave this state.'

After that, Björn disappeared, and none knew what had become of him; and
men sought but found him not, as was to be expected. We must now relate
how that the king's sheep were slaughtered, half a score at a time, and
it was all the work of a grey bear, both huge and grimly.

"One evening it chanced that the Carle's daughter saw this savage bear
coming towards her, looking tenderly at her, and she fancied that she
recognized the eyes of Björn, the king's son, so she made a slight
attempt to escape; then the beast retreated, but she

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

followed it, till she came to a cave. Now when she entered the cave
there stood before her a man, who greeted Bera, the Carle's daughter;
and she recognized him, for he was Björn, Hring's son. Overjoyed were
they to meet. So they were together in the cave awhile, for she would
not part from him when she had the chance of being with him; but he said
that this was not proper that she should be there by him, for by day he
was a beast, and by night a man.

"Hring returned from his harrying, and he was told the news, of what had
taken place during his absence; how that Björn, his son, had vanished,
and also, how that a monstrous beast was up the country, and was
destroying his flocks. The queen urged the king to have the beast slain,
but he delayed awhile.

"One night, as Bera and Björn were together, he said to her:--'Methinks
to-morrow will be the day of my death, for they will come out to hunt me
down. But for myself I care not, for it is little pleasure to live with
this charm upon me, and my only comfort is that we are together; but now
our union must be broken. I will give you the ring which is under my
left hand. You will see the troop of hunters to-morrow coming to

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

seek me; and when I am dead go to the king, and ask him to give you what
is under the beast's left front leg. He will consent.'

"He spoke to her of many other things, till the bear's form stole over
him, and he went forth a bear. She followed him, and saw that a great
body of hunters had come over the mountain ridges, and had a number of
dogs with them. The bear rushed away from the cavern, but the dogs and
the king's men came upon him, and there was a desperate struggle. He
wearied many men before he was brought to bay, and had slain all the
dogs. But now they made a ring about him, and he ranged around it., but
could see no means of escape, so he turned to where the king stood, and
he seized a man who stood next him, and rent him asunder; then was the
bear so exhausted that he cast himself down flat, and, at once, the men
rushed in upon him and slew him. The Carle's daughter saw this, and she
went up to the king, and said,--'Sire! wilt thou grant me that which is
under the bear's left fore-shoulder?' The king consented. By this time
his men had nearly flayed the bear; Bera went up and plucked away the
ring, and kept it, but none saw what she took, nor had they looked for
anything. The king

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

asked her who she was, and she gave a name, but not her true name.

"The king now went home, and Bera was in his company. The queen was very
joyous, and treated her well, and asked who she was; but Bera answered
as before.

"The queen now made a great feast, and had the bear's flesh cooked for
the banquet. The Carle's daughter was in the bower of the queen, and
could not escape, for the queen had a suspicion who she was. Then she
came to Bera with a dish, quite unexpectedly, and on it was bear's
flesh, and she bade Bera eat it. She would not do so. 'Here is a
marvel!' said the queen; 'you reject the offer which a queen herself
deigns to make to you. Take it at once, or something worse will befall
you.' She bit before her, and she ate of that bite; the queen cut
another piece, and looked into her mouth; she saw that one little grain
of the bite had gone down, but Bera spat out all the rest from her
mouth, and said she would take no more, though she were tortured or
killed.

"'Maybe you have had sufficient,' said the queen, and she
laughed."--(Hrolfs Saga Kraka, c. 24-27, condensed.)

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

In the Faroëse song of Finnur hin friði, we have the following verse:--

The following is from the second Kviða of Helga Hundingsbana (stroph.
31):--

May the blade bite,  
Which thou brandishest  
Only on thyself,  
when it Chimes on thy head.  
Then avenged will be  
The death of Helgi,  
When thou, as a wolf,  
Wanderest in the woods,  
Knowing nor fortune  
Nor any pleasure,  
Haying no meat,  
Save rivings of corpses.

In all these cases the change is of the form: we shall now come to
instances in which the person who is changed has a double shape, and the
soul animates one after the other.

The Ynglinga Saga (c. 7) says of Odin, that "he changed form; the bodies
lay as though sleeping or dead, but he was a bird or a beast, a fish, or
a woman, and went in a twinkling to far distant lands, doing his

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

own or other people's business." In like manner the Danish king Harold
sent a warlock to Iceland in the form of a whale, whilst his body lay
stiff and stark at home. The already quoted Saga of Hrolf Krake gives us
another example, where Bödvar Bjarki, in the shape of a huge bear,
fights desperately with the enemy, which has surrounded the hall of his
king, whilst his human body lies drunkenly beside the embers within.

In the Vatnsdæla Saga, there is a curious account of three Finns, who
were shut up in a hut for three nights, and ordered by Ingimund, a
Norwegian chief, to visit Iceland and inform him of the lie of the
country, where he was to settle. Their bodies became rigid, and they
sent their souls the errand, and, on their awaking at the end of three
days, gave an accurate description of the Vatnsdal, in which Ingimund
was eventually to establish himself. But the Saga does not relate
whether these Finns projected their souls into the bodies of birds or
beasts.

The third manner of transformation mentioned, was that in which the
individual was not changed himself, but the eyes of others were
bewitched, so that they could not detect him, but saw him only under a
certain form. Of this there are several examples in the Sagas;

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

as, for instance, in the Hromundar Saga Greypsonar, and in the
Fostbræðra Saga. But I will translate the most curious, which is that of
Odd, Katla's son, in the Eyrbyggja Saga.--(c. 20.)

"Geirrid, housewife in Mafvahlið, sent word into Bolstad, that she was
ware of the fact that Odd, Katla's son, had hewn off Aud's hand.

"Now when Thorarinn and Arnkell heard that, they rode from home with
twelve men. They spent the night in Mafvahlið, and rode on next morning
to Holt: and Odd was the only man in the house.

"Katla sat on the high seat spinning yarn, and she bade Odd sit beside
her; also, she bade her women sit each in her place, and hold their
tongues. 'For,' said she, 'I shall do all the talking.' Now when Arnkell
and his company arrived, they walked straight in, and when they came
into the chamber, Katla greeted Arnkell, and asked the news. He replied
that there was none, and he inquired after Odd. Katla said that he had
gone to Breidavik. 'We shall ransack the house though,' quoth Arnkell.
'Be it so,' replied Katla, and she ordered a girl to carry a light
before them, and unlock the different parts of the house. All they saw
was Katla spinning yarn off her distaff. Now they

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

search the house, but find no Odd, so they depart. But when they had
gone a little way from the garth, Arnkell stood still and said: 'How
know we but that Katla has hoodwinked us, and that the distaff in her
hand was nothing more than Odd.' 'Not impossible!' said Thorarinn; 'let
us turn back.' They did so; and when those at Holt raw that they were
returning, Katla said to her maids, 'Sit still in your places, Odd and I
shall go out.'

"Now as they approached the door, she went into the porch, and began to
comb and clip the hair of her son Odd. Arnkell came to the door and saw
where Katla was, and she seemed to be stroking her goat, and
disentangling its mane and beard and smoothing its wool. So he and his
men went into the house, but found not Odd. Katla's distaff lay against
the bench, so they thought that it could not have been Odd, and they
went away. However, when they had come near the spot where they had
turned before, Arnkell said, 'Think you not that Odd may have been in
the goat's form?' 'There is no saying,' replied Thorarinn; 'but if we
turn back we will lay hands on Katla.' 'We can try our luck again,'
quoth Arnkell; 'and see what comes of it.' So they returned.

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

"Now when they were seen on their way back, Katla bade Odd follow her;
and she lea him to the ash-heap, and told him to lie there and not to
stir on any account. But when Arnkell, and his men came to the farm,
they rushed into the chamber, and saw Katla seated in her place,
spinning. She greeted them and said that their visits followed with
rapidity. Arnkell replied that what she said was true. His comrades took
the distaff and cut it in twain. 'Come now!' said Katla, 'you cannot
say, when you get home, that you have done nothing, for you have chopped
up my distaff.' Then Arnkell and the rest hunted high and low for Odd,
but could not find him; indeed they saw nothing living about the place,
beside a boar-pig which lay under the ash-heap, so they went away once
more.

"Well, when they got half-way to Mafvahlið, came Geirrid to meet them,
with her workmen. 'They had not gone the right way to work in seeking
Odd,' she said, 'but she would help them.' So they turned back again.
Geirrid had a blue cloak on her. Now when the party was seen and
reported to Katla, and it was said that they were thirteen in number,
and one had on a coloured dress, Katla exclaimed, 'That troll Geirrid is
come! I shall not be able to throw a

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

glamour over their eyes any more.' She started up from her place and
lifted the cushion of the seat, and there was a hole and a cavity
beneath: into this she thrust Odd, clapped the cushion over him, and sat
down, saying she felt sick at heart.

"Now when they came into the room, there were small greetings. Geirrid
cast of her the cloak and went up to Katla, and took the seal-skin bag
which she had in her hand, and drew it over the head of Katla.\[1\] Then
Geirrid bade them break up the seat. They did so, and found Odd. Him
they took and carried to Buland's head, where they hanged him. . . . But
Katla they stoned to death under the headland."
