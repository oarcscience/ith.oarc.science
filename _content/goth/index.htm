<P>
Gothic refers to a Romantic literary style which
can include supernatural aspects, particularly vampires.
This is because many of these stories are set in
locales with Gothic architecture.
This page includes significant non-fiction and fiction books
about vampires and related subjects.
<P>
Why cover this subject at Intangible Textual Heritage?
From Lord Byrons' literary circle to Buffy the Vampire Slayer,
vampires and their kin have evolved into a modern mythology
about the presence of <A HREF="../evil/index.htm">evil</A>
in a world governed by science.
Gothic literature is an outlet for the ancient fears
of humanity in an <A HREF="../aor/index.htm">age of reason</A>.
These texts allow us to trace the evolution of this mythology.
</P>
<P>
Gothic literature shouldn't be confused with
texts <I>in</I> the Gothic language,
the earliest written Germanic language, which
includes the Codex Argentius, a translation of parts of the
New Testament.
For more information, 
we recommend <A HREF="https://www.cs.tut.fi/~dla/gothic.html">Database of the Gothic Language</A> [External Site].

by <span class="c_a">Montague Summers</span>. [<span class="c_d">1928</span>] &emsp; <span class="c_b">Summers, a devout and very literal Catholic,
was apparently convinced of the reality of the undead.</span>
This work is a serious, often pedantic, academic review of the literature.
However, it is required reading for any prospective vampire experts.
(An Internet rumor has it that Buffy
Summers got her last name from this author; we welcome any
comments on whether there is any truth to this.)

One of the best known studies of lycanthropy,
written by the author of the hymn 'Onward Christian Soldiers.'
The first ten chapters are a pretty good review of the shape-shifting
literature, and then it takes a strange
left turn into the topic of psychopathy.

<span class="c_t"><A HREF="frank/index.htm">Frankenstein</A></span>
by <span class="c_a">Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley</span> [<span class="c_d">1831</span>] &emsp; <span class="c_b">It's alive!</span>
Originaly published in 1818,
this modern reworking of the Golem story
is a cautionary tale about science.
Frankenstein just keeps getting more relevant as we
stumble forward into the 21st Century of clones, stem cells and 
<A HREF="../dna/index.htm">genomics</A>.
Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, along with her husband,
the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, was a member of Lord Byron's circle;
her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft,
wrote one of the key feminist documents,
<A HREF="../wmn/vind.txt">Vindication of the Rights Of Woman</A>
(also at this site).

by <span class="c_a">John Polidori</span> [<span class="c_d">1819</span>] &emsp; <span class="c_b">This short proto-gothic novel caused a sensation at the time, and spawned 
a vampire craze.</span>
Numerous books and plays based on
or imitating its story line.
Originally spuriously attributed to Lord Byron,
this was actually written by Dr. John
William Polidori, a physician friend of Lord Byron.
The main character of Ruthven is reputedly based on Byron.

by <span class="c_a">Bram Stoker</span> [<span class="c_d">1897</span>] &emsp; <span class="c_b">Dracula, not Ruthven, is the template for the modern vampire craze.</span>
This novel, in the form of fictional journals and letters,
was not the first or even the best 19th Century vampire tale,
but is today the best known, due to the endless number of movies based on it.
Today we know that Dracula had a medieval counterpart, Vlad the Impaler,
who lived in Wallachia (which is to the south of Transylvania),
today part of Romania.
Although not an actual vampire, Vlad was said to
have spilled quite a bit of blood in his day.

<span class="c_b">An erotic thriller of demonic possession, this time by a giant invertebrate.</span>
<CITE>Lair</CITE> was made into a dreadful movie by Ken Russell,

translated by Sir <span class="c_a">Richard R. Burton</span>. [<span class="c_d">1870</span>] &emsp; <span class="c_b">The Vampire Scheherazade.</span>
This collection of Hindu fables, which has an Arabian Nights-style
backstory with a legendary Indian monarch playing Scheherazade to
an undead being,
doesn't have much to do with vampires, but this seemed
the best place to put it.
Burton, as it happens, also translated the
<A HREF="../neu/index.htm#arabia">Arabian Nights</A>.
Links to other Burton material at Intangible Textual Heritage
(most not suitable for children) can be found in the
