<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Every society has its rites of passage, rituals which acknowledge the crossing over from one state of being to the next.&#160; Here in America, going out and buying alcohol on your 21<sup>st</sup> birthday has become a widespread tradition.&#160; When people do this, they are celebrating a rite of passage that marks their transition from childhood to adulthood.</p>  
<p>Rites of passage help us to structure out lives.&#160; They help us set up the parameters that define one state of being from another.&#160; As the above example attests, rites of passage do not always have to be religiously connected.&#160; So long as the symbolism of the ritual resonates with its purpose, it will suffice for those involved.&#160; </p>  
<p>There are some rites of passage experienced by all communities, regardless of religion or culture; these are birth, marriage, and death.&#160; These three transitions are experienced by practically everyone on the planet.&#160; But depending on the society, there can be other transitions as well, such as a boy&#146;s entering into manhood, or a priest&#146;s ordination into his order.&#160; These transitions deserve to be formally recognized as well, and ritual adds both solemnity and meaning to the experience.&#160; </p>  
<p>Within our community, there are quite a few rites of passage to be celebrated.&#160; There is the initial acceptance into the community, and after that, there are different levels of knowledge and understanding to be attained within the community.&#160; As a member learns and grows, he or she passes through a kind of spiritual childhood to a spiritual adulthood.&#160; This transition is important and should be recognized with a rite.&#160; Acceptance into a household is another transition unique to our community that can be solemnized with a rite of passage.&#160; Marriage is important to many members of our community, but the relationship between a vampire and a donor, while not always a marriage, should be solemnized as well.&#160; And these are just a few of the rites that have special significance to our unique community. </p>  
<p>All of the following ceremonies use language and symbolism that make them uniquely ours.&#160; They are designed to help establish the stages of growth and the significant life transitions that are special to our community.&#160; As with all the ceremonies and rituals in this book, please feel free to alter and add to these rituals to tailor them for your own particular group or family.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  <h1 align="center">The Rite of Dedication</h1>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This is the most basic initiation, one that simply acknowledges that the initiate wishes to become a part of the community.&#160; The person who takes this initiation is formally acknowledged as a student or fledgling, but he or she is still in the outer circle.&#160; This is not a ritual of transformation.&#160; That comes later, when the initiate knows a little more about the community. Most groups require that an initiate have a sponsor from within the community even to get this far.&#160; After this initiation, the sponsor is allowed to teach the initiate the basics of the community, and a rite of transformation (or death and rebirth) may be performed when the initiate is deemed ready.&#160; </p>  
<p align="center"><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>(Begin with a Charge or Opening Prayer)</i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest:</b> We gather together this night because there is one among us seeking answers. This new seeker has glimpsed the greater reality of what we are, and yearns to know more.&#160; Now it is time to take the first few steps on the journey toward understanding.</p>  
<p><i>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; (Seeker)</i>, come forward. You stand now in a sacred place, before all those who have gone before you on this path, so be certainly that you speak truly. Tell me, <i>(Seeker)</i>, what do you come seeking?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Seeker: </b>I come seeking understanding.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest:</b> And why do you seek this?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Seeker: </b>To better know myself and my place in the world.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>And how do you seek this?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Seeker: </b>With pure intentions and an open heart.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Very well, then.&#160; We accept your sincerity. <i>(Seeker)</i>.&#160; Look around you here at our gathering.&#160; These are your fellow seekers, those who have passed this way before.&#160; Our paths are many, but the journey we have undertaken is the same.</p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Ours is a journey toward understanding.&#160; In accepting our natures, we accept a responsibility our souls took up many millennia ago.&#160; Ours also is a journey of transformation.&#160; In changing ourselves, we seek to change the very world in which we live.&#160; </p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Ours is a solitary journey, often misunderstood.&#160; It is a long and arduous path we walk, and the way is not always clear.&#160; This is a journey of many lifetimes, and in undertaking it, you are undertaking a great responsibility.&#160; The burden you seek to take up here, you will carry with you for many years.</p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Do you still seek to walk beside us?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Seeker: </b>I do.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest:<u> </u></b>Very well.&#160; Before you embark upon this transformative journey, there are certain vows you must make to us.&#160; I charge you by all you hold sacred to carry these vows in your heart.&#160; If it is found that you have broken any one of these, you will be expelled from our company, and all that you have gained will be stripped away. </p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Answer me, <i>&#147;So do I swear.&#148;</i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Do you swear to accept the burden of responsibility for your thoughts and actions as you follow this path?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Seeker: </b>So do I swear.<i></i></p>  
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Do you swear that you shall always seek with a pure heart and an honest desire and that you will never abuse the knowledge that you gain as you walk this path?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Seeker: </b>So do I swear.<i></i></p>  
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Do you swear that you will guard this knowledge from those who would abuse it, never revealing those of our number to any who might bring them harm?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Seeker: </b>So do I swear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>And do you swear to dedicate yourself to change, taking up the burden of transformation which is our birthright? </p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Seeker: </b>So do I swear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>It has been witnessed.</p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Initiate.&#160; Always look within yourself first for the answers that you seek.&#160; Others may offer guidance, but only you can walk your path.</p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Before you leave this circle, I have five gifts to give to you.&#160; Each is a lesson and a revelation.&#160; Carry them with you as your strength on this path.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>(The Priest goes to the altar where a chalice of water, a burning candle, a bowl of ash, and some burning incense are waiting.&#160; The Priest takes the chalice of water first, and dipping her fingers into it, anoints the forehead of the Initiate.)</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><i>(Seeker&#146;s name)</i>,&#160; I do consecrate you with water, so you may be fluid and change as the tides of the world change.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>(The Priest takes the candle and passes it under the Initiate&#146;s face, taking care not to burn him.)</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><i>(Seeker&#146;s name)</i>, I do consecrate you with fire that you may know your passions and the spirit which drives you.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>(The Priest takes the ash and, dipping her fingers into it, marks the forehead of the Initiate with a single, short line.)</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><i>(Seeker&#146;s name)</i>, I do consecrate you with earth, so you may balance your spiritual pursuits with feet firmly planted here in the material realm.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>(The Priest takes the lit incense and passes it in front of the Initiate, wafting the smoke toward him.)</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><i>(Seeker&#146;s name)</i>, I do consecrate you with air, that you may aspire to the heavens with an intellect and imagination capable of transforming the world.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>(The Priest cups her hands and channels energy into them, then lays these over the initiate&#146;s heart.)</i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>(<i>Seeker&#146;s Name</i>) And I do consecrate you with spirit so you may never forget what it is we are.</p>  
<p>&#160;</p>  
<p>Now, <i>(Seeker)</i>.&#160; Step forward and be reborn.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>(The Priest embraces the Initiate, often giving a personal blessing as she does so.&#160; The Priest takes the Initiate&#146;s hand and has him stand beside her, presenting him to the group.)</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Everyone, welcome <i>(Seeker)</i> into our number.&#160; Give him your blessings and your love.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>(Each of those present embrace the Initiate, offering words of welcome or personal blessings.)</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p>This ceremony is ended, and your journey just begun.</p>  
<p>Go forth to walk in darkness and in light.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>All:</b> Forever.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>The Sanguine Initiation</p>  
<p>Within the Sanguinarian aspect of the community, blood plays an integral role in exchanges between mentor and student as well as between vampire and donor.&#160; In the mythology of vampirism, the power of the vampire is passed from mentor to student, and it is through such an exchange that one becomes a vampire or is &#147;turned.&#148; Most members of the community accept that you cannot be &#147;turned&#148; into a vampire &#150; vampiric qualities are with us all along. However, potent exchanges can help to bring these to the forefront, and the passing of power from a teacher to an initiate is an ancient tradition that underscores a number of magickal systems.</p>  
<p>While among Pranic vampires, the initiatory exchange is often one of energy, among Sanguinarians, the initiation of a new member into the community often involves a symbolic sharing of blood.&#160; This rite is an example of a Sanguine initiation, and should be used only by consenting adults in a safe and responsible manner.&#160; Both persons involved in such a rite should study the safe practices of bloodletting beforehand, so they understand all aspects of this exchange and all risks involved.</p>  
<p>This rite can very effectively be turned into a Pranic rite of initiation simply by substituting an energy exchange for the exchange of blood.</p>  
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>  
<p><b>Preparation: </b></p>  
<p>You will need two new lancets, two cups of red wine, and alcohol swabs (and possibly band-aids) for aftercare.&#160; Set these out somewhere on an altar or small table near where the ceremony is going to be held.&#160; For most people, this rite is intensely personal and should be celebrated privately between mentor and student.&#160; For a few groups, this is an event the whole community celebrates, and therefore the mentor and student perform their exchange at the center of a circle formed by the members of the entire household.&#160; The actual form the ritual takes can vary from person to person and from household to household, but the exchange of blood between mentor and student is pretty universal in any Sanguine initiation. <i>Be certain that both mentor and student have recent paperwork verifying that they are free from blood-borne diseases. Be aware of safety first whenever working with blood.</i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>The Rite:</b></p>  
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>  
<p><b>Mentor</b><b>:</b> I have brought you here tonight because I wish to share with you the most precious gift I have to give:&#160; my nature.&#160; You have been with me for some time now, learning and sharing in my life, and now I feel it is time to pass that life on to you.</p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We are creatures of darkness, but we are also creatures of life.&#160; Life empowers us and sustains us.&#160; It is our most precious possession, and the greatest gift we can share.&#160; By sharing my blood with you this night, I am sharing with you my life, my vitality, my very soul.</p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Do you understand the importance of what I am offering you?&#160; After tonight, we two will be connected in a way that goes beyond words.&#160; More than brother (sister), more than friend, you will be the child of my heart and my soul.&#160; Neither you nor I can break the bond that is forged tonight.&#160; Are you willing to accept it?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Student:</b> I am willing to accept your most precious gift.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Mentor</b><b>:</b> Very well, but before I give of myself to you, you must first surrender yourself to me.&#160; I will be your teacher, your parent and your guide within this community, and in order for me to fulfill my role to you, you must place your trust in me. Do you understand what that means?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Student:</b> I do, and I willingly offer myself to you.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left"><i>(The student should focus on his vital energy, gathering it into one hand and focusing specifically on one finger. When ready, the student then opens one of the lancets and taps the tip of this finger with the sharp point. Continuing to focus vital energy and the essence of himself into that finger, thus infusing the blood, the student then guides a drop or two of blood to fall into the chalice of wine. Cupping the wine in both hands, the student gently swirls it around, continuing to infuse it with his essence and his energy. Reverently, the student hands the chalice to the mentor. The mentor accepts the chalice and takes a drink, without completely draining the chalice.)</i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Mentor</b><b>:</b> Your sacrifice is appreciated.&#160; With what you have given me, I will be bound to you as much as you will be bound to me.&#160; I will not forget our bond or treat it carelessly.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left"><i>(The mentor then focuses on his own vital energy, gathering it into one hand and focusing specifically on one finger. Beyond just focusing on his essence and vital energy, the mentor should also focus on his identity as a vampyre, what that means and everything that comes along with it. When ready, the mentor then opens the other lancet and taps the tip of this finger with the point. Continuing to focus vital energy and the essential nature of his vampirism into that finger, the mentor then guides a drop or two of blood to fall into the chalice of wine.)</i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Mentor</b><b>:</b> This is my blood, my precious life.&#160; It is the symbol of my spirit and all that I am.&#160; I shed this for you so that you may drink and become one of our number.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>(Cupping the wine in both hands, the mentor gently swirls the wine around, mingling not only his own essence and energy with the wine but also mingling his own energy with that of the student&#146;s. Reverently, he hands the chalice to his student. The student accepts the chalice and drinks the remainder. The student and mentor may embrace after this.)</i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Mentor</b><b>:</b> You are now blood of my blood and soul of my soul.&#160; Everything that I am, you are as well.&#160; Never fail to appreciate the sanctity of this precious gift.&#160; Let us be bound together, in darkness and in light.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Student:</b> Forever.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left"><i>(Mentor and student clasp hands, and may choose to press their wounds together.&#160; If either has anything further to say to the other, now is the time.&#160; The union should be solemnized with a moment of silence.&#160; If they are with a group, the mentor then presents the student to the others after this moment of silent reflection.&#160; If they have performed the ceremony alone, at the next gathering, the student will be presented around as a member of the community.)</i></p>  
<p align="left"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p align="left"><b>Note: </b>In the case of psi-vamps, this same rite can be used as an initiation. Simply remove the blood aspect entirely and rely solely upon an infusion of energy into the ritual wine. Any sanguine rite can be tailored to psychic vampires in this way, and similarly, any rite involving just energy can be used by sanguine vampires simply by replacing any energetic offering with a safe offering of a few drops of blood obtained with sterilized lancets.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>First Degree Initiation</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Some groups are very informal about their degrees of initiation.&#160; Some are very strict.&#160; This is a basic ritual to recognize an initiate&#146;s passage from the Outer   Circle to the first level of the Inner Circle.&#160; Depending on the system, the initiate may still not have gone through a rite of transformation, although they most certainly have gone through a formal Dedication Ceremony as described earlier.&#160; To achieve this degree, the initiate must have decided on the role they wish to fill within the community.&#160; In groups that use the caste system, this means the initiate has decided what caste they belong to and how this affects their relation to the rest of their household.&#160; In order to &#147;pass&#148; this ritual, the initiate must adequately respond to the questions that the secondary priest and the High Priest will put to him during the course of the ceremony.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Preparation: </p>  
<p align="left">The energy of the ritual space is established according to the group&#146;s tradition. Once the temple has been erected, the members of the Inner Circle gather together with the High Priest.&#160; They all form a circle and join hands.&#160; At the far end of the circle, opposite the High Priest, two people do not join hands, leaving an opening in the circle. This threshold is blocked by a Guardian, typically played by a member of the Warrior caste, who stands facing out of the circle.&#160; The Guardian may have a blade or a staff to represent his or her office. </p>  
<p align="left">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The initiate and the initiate&#146;s sponsor are not present for the set-up, nor do they stand in the circle. Ideally, they should meet in a separate room and wait for the Herald to retrieve them. The Herald is the only one allowed to pass in and out of the sacred space unchallenged. Those gathered in the circle discuss the initiate and how each person present feels about that person achieving this degree. When everyone is ready, the High Priest sends the Herald out to retrieve the initiate and his or her sponsor. The Herald leads them back to the circle, passing by the Guardian. The Guardian allows the Herald to pass but blocks the initiate.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">The Rite:</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Guardian: What are you doing here?</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Initiate: I have come seeking the Elders.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Guardian: (barring the way) You may not pass.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Initiate: I have prepared long and hard for this.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Guardian: You may not pass.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Initiate: There is nowhere else for me.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Guardian: You may not pass.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Sponsor: I will take responsibility for him.&#160; </p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Guardian: Very well.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left"><i>(the Guardian moves aside, and the sponsor leads the initiate into the circle.&#160; The initiate is brought before the High Priest.)</i></p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">High Priest: (<i>Sponsor&#146;s name</i>)&#160; You have entered our Inner   Circle with a stranger who does not belong.&#160; Who is this person and why do you bring him here?</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Sponsor: This is (<i>Initiate&#146;s name</i>), my student.&#160; I have taught him the ways of our family, and now I feel it is time he be accepted among us.&#160; If you require, I will speak for him.</p>  
<p align="left">&#160;</p>  
<p align="left">High Priest: Let him speak for himself.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left"><i>(The Sponsor nods, then steps aside, leaving the initiate to stand alone in the center of the circle.)</i></p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">High Priest: Who are you?</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Initiate: (<i>Name</i>) the student of (S<i>ponsor&#146;s name</i>)<i></i></p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">High Priest: Why do you come here?</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Initiate:&#160; This is where I belong.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">High Priest: What do you seek to gain?</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Initiate:&#160; Knowledge of my Self and my community.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">High Priest: What do you have to offer us?</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Initiate: <i>(responds with the appropriate phrase)</i></p>  
<p align="left">I am a Warrior, I offer my strength.</p>  
<p align="left">I am a Counselor, I offer my love.</p>  
<p align="left">I am a Priest, I offer my vision.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">High Priest: Very well.&#160; You stand before our inner community, and we acknowledge your words.&#160; (<i>Sponsor&#146;s name</i>) speaks for you, and though his recommendation goes far, it is not enough.&#160; Many have come before us, and it takes more than words to win our trust.&#160; What are you willing to sacrifice to prove you are sincere?</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Initiate: I offer my very life-force to any of you here.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left"><i>(the initiate cups his hands before his heart and channels energy there.&#160; Anyone who wishes to share this from the circle goes and lays a hand over the initiate&#146;s heart.)</i></p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">High Priest: Your offering is accepted.&#160; Your words are sincere.&#160; You claim a place among us.&#160; Do any of the Elders object to this?</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Everyone: We have no objection.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">High Priest: Then let us welcome him in.&#160; (<i>Sponsor&#146;s name</i>), you are no longer responsible for this person, for he has proven that he can walk among us on his own.&#160; From this moment onward, his actions are his own actions, and any praise or blame those actions earn belongs to him. </p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left"><i>&#160;(The Priest places an ankh or other symbol of the household around the initiate&#146;s neck).&#160; </i></p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">High Pries: (<i>Initiate&#146;s name</i>), take this ankh and wear it proudly.&#160; It is a symbol of our household, and by wearing it, you proclaim to all the world that you are one of our number.&#160; Let it remind you of this night and the duties you have proclaimed.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left"><i>(The initiate can optionally say the Sanguine Ankh Consecration as the ankh is placed over his head. Once it is done, the High Priest embraces the initiate and presents him to the Elders.)</i></p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">High Priest: (<i>Initiate&#146;s name</i>), you are given the title of Warrior /Priest / Counselor <i>(choose the appropriate one; alternately use Mradu / Ramkht / Kitra). </i>You now stand at First Degree within our circle. <i>(alternately, &#147;Calmae&#148;).</i> Use your knowledge responsibly, and respect what you have earned.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left"><i>(Everyone welcomes the initiate by name and may at this time offer specific blessings. The sponsor may also offer specific words of encouragement or advice.)</i></p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>High Priest: </b>This ceremony is ended.&#160; Let us go forth now in darkness and in light.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This basic wedding ceremony can be expanded upon to add elements of Pagan handfastings, more traditional aspects such as giving away the bride, and any number of alterations. It can also be altered to include a sanguine exchange between the bride and groom if they so choose this.&#160; For a Sanguinarian wedding ceremony, when the bride and groom exchange wine with one another, each of them should also make a small cut on one finger with a new, sterilized lancet, and add a few drops of their own blood to the wine they present to their partner.</p>  
<p align="left">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This ceremony requires wine to be exchanged, and therefore you will need a bottle of wine and a chalice. The best man will handle the wine, the maid of honor carries the chalice. There is a place left for an exchange of personally-written vows between bride and groom, and an exchange of rings can be inserted here as well.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>The Rite:</b></p>  
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Friends.&#160; When we come into this world, we have only our selves, and most of our journey in life is walked alone.&#160; Some of us are content in our solitude, while others spend their whole lives searching for someone else to share with them their passions, their sorrows, and their joys.</p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A very lucky few of us can find that person: someone who helps us carry our burdens and achieve our dreams, just as we, in turn, help them.&#160; It is a rare and wondrous occasion when we realize that we have found someone to build a life with; and such an occasion should be celebrated, solemnly and joyfully, among friends.</p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; We are gathered here tonight because there are two souls among us who cry out for union. They have walked together for a time now, and they have realized that they no longer wish to walk alone.</p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Would (<i>bride&#146;s name</i>) and (<i>groom&#146;s name</i>) please step forward?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>(The couple to be married steps forward. If a more traditional wedding ceremony is desired, the groom may step forward and wait by the priest while a friend or relative walks the bride forward to join them.)</i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>(<i>Groom&#146;s name</i>) and (<i>bride&#146;s name</i>).&#160; By swearing yourselves to one another this night, you help forge a bond that will be with you in every time and in every place throughout the long journey of years.&#160; Marriage is not merely a bond of the flesh;&#160; it is also a binding of souls.&#160; </p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; When we touch one another, when we kiss and make love, we do not embrace only the body.&#160; We touch the spirit as well.&#160; The union of flesh is sacred and beautiful, but the union of souls is forever.&#160; Even when death separates you, that bond will remain.&#160; Nothing is more eternal than a vampire's love.&#160; </p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Now that you understand this, are you still ready to swear yourselves to one another and enter into a binding union?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Bride &amp; Groom</b>: Yes, we are.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Very well. Repeat after me:</p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><i>(The priest takes the groom&#146;s hand and looks him in the eye. The Priest then says each line below, and the groom repeats it.)</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>  <h1 align="center">&nbsp;</h1>  <h1 align="center">Naming Ceremony </h1>  <h1 align="center">(Dedication to the Child)</h1>  
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>  
<p><b>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </b>Children are often a natural consequence of marriage and other unions. This ritual is offered as an alternative to a Baptism or Wiccaning, providing a rite that acknowledges both the child and the responsibility of child-rearing. This rite can also be used to bind a non-related care-giver to the child, as in the case of a step-parent or other individual who is committed to helping raise the little one. </p>  
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>  
<p><b>The Rite:</b></p>  
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>We are gathered tonight to welcome a new soul into our community.&#160; This child represents the greatest potential any of us can achieve: the ability to affect the future.&#160; By nurturing, guiding, and gently instructing this new life, we can create positive change that will be felt now and in succeeding generations.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>(The parents and/or caregivers are called forth. If both parents cannot be present, it is preferable that the mother lead the child through this ceremony, but there is no restriction that prevents the father from being the main supporter in the rite.)</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b><i>(Mother and Father)</i>.&#160; This little soul has chosen you as his parents.&#160; There are things that he feels he can learn from you, and undoubtedly there will be things that you can learn from him.</p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Through your body, <i>Mother),</i> you provided him flesh.&#160; It is thus your duty to nurture that flesh.&#160; As his parents and caregivers, you are bound to feed him and to clothe him, to keep him safe, and to nurse him through illness.&#160; But your duties do not end there, for this child is not simply a being of flesh and blood.&#160; He is a being of mind and spirit as well.</p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As you must nurture his body, so must you nurture both his spirit and his mind.&#160; In this way, you will become not merely his caretakers, but his guides, his guardians, and his friends as well.&#160; Henceforth, it will be your sacred duty to teach this child in the ways of the world, to instruct him in his spiritual path, to help him explore and develop his intellect and natural abilities, and to provide him with your compassion, your support, your discipline and your love.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Being a parent is not just about giving birth.&#160; In nurturing this little life, you are committing yourselves to great burdens and rewards. &#160;I ask you both, do you understand the full measure of what you are committing to?&#160; Are you both willing and able to undertake this responsibility to this child?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Response: </b>Yes, we are.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Very well.&#160; There are seven vows that you must swear to this child.&#160; These bind you to him, in spirit as well as blood.&#160; I charge you both, by all that you hold sacred, to keep these vows inscribed upon your hearts, and to never forget them in all your dealings through this child&#146;s life.&#160; </p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; After each, please respond, &#147;So do I swear.&#148;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Do you swear to care for him when he is sick and to provide comfort for him when he is in pain?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Parents:</b> So do I swear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Do you swear to laugh with him and to teach him how to play so you are a friend to him as well as a mentor?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Parents:</b> So do I swear.<i></i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Do you swear to be his emotional support when he is going through hard times and to serve as his spiritual guide as well as you are able?</p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><b>Parents:</b> So do I swear.<i></i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Do you swear to teach him about himself and the world around him and to help him learn to lead a happy and centered life?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Parents:</b> So do I swear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Do you swear to encourage him to experiment and explore his identity and his gifts, guiding him safely with an open mind?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Parents:</b> So do I swear.</p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Do you swear to provide discipline when it is needed, but always to correct him with love and never with anger in your heart?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Parents:</b> So do I swear.<i></i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>And finally, to love him unconditionally, no matter what, and to always welcome him back into your heart if he chooses to stray?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Parents:</b> So do I swear.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>(The Priest weaves energy between all parties swearing the oath to bind and witness the vow.)</i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest:&#160; </b>It has been witnessed.&#160; Now, place your hands over the child&#146;s heart.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>(Those who are dedicating themselves to the child step forward and join the mother, each placing a hand gently upon the child.&#160; The priest lays hands over the hands upon the child.)</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>I bind you to this child, not with ties of blood, but with your own vows and dedication.&#160; In heart as well as in spirit, this child is now a part of you, to be treated as you would be treated yourself.</p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <i>(Names of Mother and Caregivers),</i> may each of you become a mentor to this child during his youth, and his friend once he has grown.&#160; Keep sacred the vows you have made tonight.&#160; Remember that you do not have to be a perfect parent, but you should strive to be perfect in your love.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>(The Priest sends a warm wave of energy through all their hands, blessing the Mother and Caregivers. There is a moment of silence as all reflect on the ties sealed here this day.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>The Naming:</b></p>  
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>  
<p><i>(All step away but the mother.)</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Now, Mother: you have borne this child from his first moments.&#160; You shared with him your body, and it is by your choice that he was brought into this world.&#160; By what name shall we call him?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Mother: </b>I name this child <i>(Child&#146;s name).</i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest. </b>Very well. </p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>(The Priest gathers energy into his left hand and touches the child on the forehead, the lips, and the heart.)</i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b><i>(Child&#146;s Name).</i>&#160; I greet you.&#160; I bless you.&#160; I call you by name.&#160; May you meet the world with an open mind, a questing spirit, and a loving heart. May the secrets of the world be clear to you, and may you always find your way along your particular life&#146;s path.</p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Now, for all those who have gathered to witness this rite, I present to you the child (<i>child&#146;s name), </i>his mother, and his father.<i> </i>&#160;Please welcome this child into our community, and give everyone here your blessings and your love.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>(The family and caretakers are presented around and each person present can greet them and offer blessings or advice. When all are finished, the Priest draws the ceremony to a close.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Rite of Familial Bonds</b></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>By the descriptions that appeared in the 1998 <i>Vampyre Almanac</i>, the Sanguinarium tradition recognized several types and sizes of groups within the vampire community. These ranged from clutches to courts, differing both in size and in the nature of the connection between the individuals involved. Ultimately, as things grew and changed, the primary vampire unit became the House, a collection of individual bounds by similar beliefs and practices that is comparable to a Wiccan coven. However, a House is more of an organizational group, and many of us within the vampire community feel closer bonds then even our shared symbols and beliefs. The tight-knit groups founded by vampires who live in close proximity to one another hearken back to the ancient tribe or clan, establishing extended families that rely upon one another and provide mutual support and love. When such a group is particularly close, calling it a House does not seem quite enough. For those who feel that their circle of friends have indeed became their Family, this rite exists.</p>  
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>  
<p><b>Preamble:</b></p>  
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>The world is changing, and with it, our definition of family must change.&#160; Sometimes the families we are born into do not suit us. We may find that there are differences that cannot be surmounted. Our life choices may be rejected, or we may simply feel nothing in common with those to whom we are born. As we venture out into the world, we sometimes find brothers, sisters, and even parents among those who have no relation to us through blood.&#160; Although the relationship thus shared is something that the world might not recognize, we know the truth: family is where you find it, and love does not adhere to those boundaries imposed upon it by culture and society.&#160; </p>  
<p>In our community, especially, we often choose to redefine the boundaries of family. We find new children in those that we teach; we find new parents in those who guide us through the discovery of self. Over time, such deep connections are built that we cannot avoid the fact that we have become family to one another. Despite the opinions of the rest of the world, we must feel free to accept our family where we find it, to enjoy the love and support of those the world might consider strangers, and to honor the connection we share with those who are our spiritual flesh and blood.</p>  
<p>This is a ritual to honor such found family, so that their bond may be recognized and formalized by the community. For, whatever shape it may take, the bonds of family are sacred, and it is through love and support of others that many of us are able to make our way in the world. Would those entering together into this ritual please step forward?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>(The family steps forward and stands in a semi-circle in front of the Priest.)</i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>We gather this day to formally acknowledge the bonds that nature and birthright did not supply.&#160; You who gather here before me, (<i>name, and name, and name:) </i>you have come together in support of one another.&#160; Your connection has gone far beyond that of just friends.&#160; Yet, as you are not all lovers, and you are not blood related, the world still recognizes you only as friends.</p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; There is a word for a group of people that help of one another grow, who support one another, financially, spiritually, and emotionally, who share a bond that will remain in their hearts throughout their lives.&#160; That word is family. </p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; You <i>(insert number of people entering into the group) </i>have come before me this night to declare your devotion and to make it clear to the world that, even though you bear no connection through birth or through blood, you are a family nevertheless.</p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Is this truly your intention?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Family</b> (as one): Yes it is.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest:</b> Very well, but before we proceed, let me caution you.&#160; This bond is not to be undertaken lightly.&#160; You are about to pledge to me and all that you hold sacred that the <i>(number) </i>of you will hence forward be connected, that you will love one another and support one another through all of life's trials, working together to provide a healthy living space, where all of you can grow and flourish.&#160; Once forged, this bond should not be broken, so be certain that this is what you want -- and that you are willing to work to nurture it and to protect it. Is this still your intention?</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Family</b> (as one): yes it is.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest:</b> Very well.&#160; You will make your vows together, and then individually so that your duty to one another is perfectly clear.&#160; First, place your hands together before me. I will bind you by the ties of spirit and flesh as you swear to me these vows. I will speak each vow, and you will all, as a unit, repeat it back to me.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>(Everyone extends a hand to the center of the semi-circle, clasping hands so that they are all touching. The priest then lays his hand over theirs, weaving them together with threads of energy.)</i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>I pledge you my love, my devotion, and my support.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>All: </b>I pledge you my love, my devotion, and my support.<i></i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>In the weak times and in the hard times,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>All: </b>In the weak times and in the hard times,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>When you cannot bear up alone,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>All: </b>When you cannot bear up alone,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>I will be there, I will try to be strong.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>All: </b>I will be there, I will try to be strong.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>When you need an ear to listen,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>All: </b>When you need an ear to listen,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>a shoulder to cry on, or an extra pair of hands,</p>

<p><b>Priest: </b>I will be there for you,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>All: </b>I will be there for you,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>so we can weather the storms of life together,</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>All: </b>so we can weather the storms of life together,</p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>as a family strengthened for unity and love.<i></i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>as a family strengthened for unity and love.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest:</b> These things, you swear, and as a family, you swear them together.&#160; Now, a family is a group that is made up by individual parts, so you must each take individual vows and swear before one another to solidify this union.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>(The priest approaches each member in turn, starting with the mother or father figure, and proceeding through each member in turn, finishing with the newest member of the family. When he approaches each person, the Priest holds his hand over their head, gathering energy.)</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><b>Priest:</b> As you swear these vows, you open your mind to thinking as a family. You open your lips to speaking as a family. And you open your heart to loving as a family.&#160; </p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>(The Priest touches forehead, lips, and heart, in turn, connecting with the individual&#146;s energy and opening these points to the energy of everyone else in the family group. This is done for each person in turn before they take their individual vows. As the Priest continues to speak, he holds his hand over the individual&#146;s heart, binding their energy with the power and intent of the vow.)</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>The vows that you swear should be written upon your soul, so that you carry them with you always. You are bound by these oaths, and your place in this family relies upon your loyalty to these oaths. Never fail to appreciate the power and sanctity of what you swear here this night.&#160; After each vow, swear to your new family: &#147;I will be there.&#148;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>In times of weakness and emotional need:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Family Member: </b>I will be there.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>In times of joy and celebration:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Family Member: </b>I will be there.</p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>For the simple things, those day-to-day tasks so often overlooked:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Family Member: </b>I will be there.</p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>When the family grows together, when the family fights, and when the family makes amends:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Family Member: </b>I will be there.</p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>In love, in devotion, and in mutual support, now and all the days of my life:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Family Member: </b>I will be there.<i></i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><i>(These vows are repeated for each member.&#160; When each member has sworn these vows to every other member of the family, the priest takes all of their hands and holds them collectively together. The priest then holds his hands over their hands, weaving energy between them, forging a blessing that solidifies the bonds that they have sworn.)</i></p>  
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Spirit to spirit, flesh to flesh, I seal this sacred bond. May you be strong together, may you prosper together, and may you always know love. If any of you have any additional vows or statements to make to one another, please do so now.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>(Insert optional declarations from the family members.)</i></p>  
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Embrace, and be one.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>(All the family members engage in a group hug.)<b></b></i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>This ceremony is ended. Got forth as a Family in darkness and light.</p>

<p>The Promising of a Donor</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">There are many kinds of relationships, and sometimes marriage does not quite fit the connection which exists between two people.&#160; Within our community, a unique form of relationship has developed:&#160; that of a vampire and his or her donor.&#160; A donor can be a Kitra (Counselor caste), drawn from within the vampire community, or a donor may be a non-vampire who has nevertheless chosen to offer him or herself up to a vampire companion.&#160; The relationship between the vampire and donor is something sacred, and it should be treated as such.&#160; Promises should be made on the part of both parties, and the occasion of this promising deserves a celebration all its own.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">The Rite:</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Priest:&#160; Friends, we are gathered on this night to solemnize a very special union.&#160; Many within our community cannot exist wholly on their own.&#160; Our power, our spirit, and sometimes our very health depends upon the offerings of others.&#160; Our Counselors, our donors, our Kitra, and our beloved black swans give of themselves to sustain us, and the relationships we forge with such providers can be as lasting and profound as any marriage.</p>  
<p align="left">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Tonight we gather to celebrate the promising of a vampire and a provider.&#160; They have come together to formalize their relationship and to swear solemn vows.&#160; Would<i> (donor&#146;s name) </i>please step forward?</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left"><i>(The donor approaches the priest.)</i></p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Priest<i>: </i><i>(Donor&#146;s name),</i> you have offered yourself body and spirit to your vampire.&#160; This is not something to be undertaken lightly. The very nature of a vampire is to transform and change. You cannot be touched deeply by one of our number without being altered in some aspect of your being. It is important, before you proceed, that you understand the risks of this relationship. Do you understand that, as a donor, you are offering your own vitality to strengthen your vampire&#146;s vital force?</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Donor: I do.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Priest: Do you understand that, by swearing these vows, you are promising to take responsibility for your vampire&#146;s health, providing for him when he is in need whenever this does not endanger your own health and well-being?</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Donor: I do.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Priest: Do you understand that you are responsible not only for the health of the one you would swear to, but also for your own health, caring for yourself so the vampire&#146;s demands do not overtax you, and keeping your body free of poison and disease?</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Donor: I do.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Priest: Do you understand that when the one you would swear to feeds, he is touching not only your body but deep into your soul so that a connection will linger between you even when your physical bodies are distant?</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Donor: I do.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Priest: And do you understand that his kiss may change you in ways no one can predict, opening potential abilities and resurrecting memories that may complicate your life?</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Donor: I do.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Priest: Knowing these things, and having been advised of both the joys and the risks by the one you would swear to, are you still willing to proceed?</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Donor: I am.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Priest: Very well. Would <i>(Vampire's name) </i>please step forward and stand before me? </p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left"><i>(The vampire entering into the relationship steps forward.)</i></p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Priest: <i>(Vampire&#146;s name), </i>you have offered to accept <i>(Donor&#146;s name) </i>as your donor.&#160; Do you understand that <i>(Donor&#146;s name)</i> is bestowing upon you a sacred trust and that this relationship is not meant to benefit only you?</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Vampire: I do.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Priest: Do you understand that in taking these vows today,&#160; you take up a responsibility toward the one you would swear to, helping her, guiding her, and protecting her?</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Vampire: I do.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Priest: Do you understand that you are obligated to guard her health as if it were your own, to never overfeed, and to only take with her permission?</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Vampire: I do.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Priest: Do you understand that you both share responsibility for looking after your needs, communicating openly with one another about your health and your energy?</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Vampire: I do.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Priest: And do you understand that the interactions you propose will forge a link the goes deeper than flesh between the two of you, and that you are not to abuse this link to abuse or control her?</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Vampire: I do.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Priest: Very well.&#160; Before I solemnize this union before the eyes of our community, it is required that you each make vows to one another<i>.&#160; (Donor&#146;s name),</i> you will repeat after me:</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Priest: I promise to give of myself to <i>(Vampire&#146;s name), </i>so that my life may strengthen his life, and my soul may strengthen his soul<i>. </i></p>  
<p align="left"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p align="left">Donor: I promise to give of myself to <i>(Vampire&#146;s name), </i>so that my life may strengthen his life, and my soul may strengthen his soul<i>. </i></p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p align="left">Priest: It has been witnessed.</p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left"><i>(The Priest seals the vows with energy, weaving it between the Vampire and Donor, from forehead, to heart, to root.)</i></p>  
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="left">Priest: Everyone!&#160; <i>(Donor&#146;s name)</i> has proven that she understands her obligations to us, and she has sworn to be loyal and true.&#160; <i>(Vampire&#146;s name)</i> has proven that he understands his responsibilities, and he has sworn to treat his donor with respect and with care.&#160; </p>  
<p align="left">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Until such time as this relationship is ended mutually by the both of you, take care to be faithful to your vows.&#160; Respect one another, and make an effort to communicate.&#160; Be mindful of one another&#146;s feelings, and never do anything without considering the consequences of your actions, for this is not a worldly union of the flesh, but an agreement to share an essential portion of your souls.&#160; By giving of yourself, by taking her life into you, you will forge an bond that will tie your two spirits together for many lifetimes to come.&#160; Do not take such a sharing lightly.&#160; No one outside our community can share a union such as this.&#160; Never fail to appreciate the sanctity what you have.</p>

<p align="left"><i>(The vampire may choose to give the donor a token that will mark her as his.&#160; This will most likely be a necklace with his house sigil on it, or a pendant of some other distinguishing symbol.&#160; In rare instances, a donor may choose to get a tattoo or piercing that represents this union.)</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>The Rite of the Dead: </p>  
<p>Celebrating the Journey of the Soul</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In books and in movies, vampires are immortal, living a life that does not end except through violent circumstances. As vampires, we do not lay claim to the immortality of the physical body, but we do believe in the immortality of the soul. Death is inevitable for us all, and at the right point in life, it is often a welcome transition, leading us from a life we have finished to a whole new set of opportunities and possibilities. Although death should not be feared, there is no denying that it can be traumatic, and no one is hurt more than those who are left behind. The following rite is acknowledges both the new journey undertaken by a soul that has transitioned from flesh to spirit and also the pain and loss experience by those who remain behind.</p>  
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>  
<p><b>Preparation: </b></p>  
<p>This rite should be performed either at the funeral home where the body is being shown to family and friends or at the graveside, prior to actual burial. Because so many members of the community see the body as just a vessel that is necessarily mortal and finite, few may choose to go to the trouble and expense of having their bodies embalmed.&#160; In the case of cremation, of course, no body is shown, and an urn, with a photo and other mementos of the deceased will be the focus of the rite.&#160; </p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; In some cases, the family of the deceased will not be sympathetic to his beliefs, and a priest of a traditional religion will be present for the &#147;real&#148; funeral.&#160; In such cases, first attempt to get permission from the family members to have a small memorial service of your own.&#160; If it is impossible to reason with the family, then a private service among the community will have to be held without the actual presence of the deceased.&#160; In such a private rite, set up a small memorial altar to the dead person, placing photos, items of special importance, and other mementos at the center of the ritual space.</p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Friends and family gather for the ritual.&#160; A small group of those who were closest to the deceased (lovers, immediate family, best friends) is selected, and these individuals should have some token to leave with their departed one.&#160; These tokens are symbols of love, promises, and well-wishing for the future, and they can take any form.&#160; Flowers are acceptable, or polished stones, hand-made cards or letters, or even small statues or pieces of jewelry &#150; these gifts represent one final bond between the living and the dead, and they are very important for the living to help them achieve closure with the deceased.&#160; If the rite occurs by the casket, these items are placed inside to be buried with the deceased.&#160; If the rite is held at the graveside, the tokens can be thrown in on the coffin before the first spadefuls of earth or left around the memorial stone.&#160; If the rite had to be held privately, have the immediate family and friends leave their tokens on the memorial altar, and then gather these up to be placed at the gravesite at a later time.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>(The Priest opens the ceremony with the Charge or Opening Prayer)</p>  
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>  
<p><b>Proclamation:</b></p>  
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Friends!&#160; This night marks a very somber occasion.&#160; <i>(Name),</i> our dear friend and a valued member of our community, has left us and moved on to a new life and new beginnings. Tonight we gather in honor of <i>(Name), </i>to remember his life with us, and to reflect upon the meaning of his death.</p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Death comes to all of us in our time.&#160; Although our spirits are immortal, the flesh is weak.&#160; Our bodies are mere vessels for our eternal Selves, and not only is it unavoidable that these bodies will weaken and die, but that death is a necessary step for further growth and change.&#160;&#160; </p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; However we may understand these truths in our spirits and in our minds, death is still a very difficult process for the heart to endure.&#160; We love what is familiar to us.&#160; We grow accustomed to a particular face or smile, the pleasing notes of a specific voice.&#160; These things are unique to each incarnation, and once they have faded they will never occur in quite the same way again.&#160; This is the true loss in death.&#160; The spirit has left a body that was failing and giving out in order to move on to something vital and new.&#160; But we, the living, must continue on with the knowledge that, although the spirit lives, the particular combination of body and soul that we have come to cherish and know as <i>(Name)</i> will never be with us again.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Reading</b><b>:</b> </p>  
<p>(an optional reading may be inserted here. More than one person can read something they have prepared to honor the deceased. Many will probably want this honor. To keep the length of the rite down, choose three who were closest to the deceased. If many other members of the community feel they must say something, have them write their sentiments on a piece of parchment. These can be buried with the deceased or, if this is impossible, all the parchments should be gathered and burned, then the ashes scattered to the winds so the intent of the letters is carried to the deceased.)</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Responsorial:</b></p>  
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b><i>(Name)! </i>You touched each and every one of us.&#160; You changed our lives, and none of us will be the same because of you.&#160; The bonds that we forged with you will not be erased with the passage of time, nor the passing from one life to the next.&#160; Even though you have moved on to something different, we&#160; will all remember what&#160; we share with you.</p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; After each statement, please respond:&#160; &#147;We will not forget.&#148;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>(The Priest can read the following statements or, alternately, various members of the mourning party can each be assigned one statement to read. This last works well especially if the mourning party is sizable.)</i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest:</b>Your vision, your insight, the lessons you taught us:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>All: </b>We will not forget.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Your voice, your smile, the sound of your laughter:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>All: </b>We will not forget.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Your heart, your compassion, the way that you touched us:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>All: </b>We will not forget.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Your quirks, your hang-ups, all your endearing faults:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>All: </b>We will not forget.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>And when next we see you, in another life:</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>All: </b>We will not forget.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>(Everyone observes a moment of silence.)</i></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b><i>(Name)!</i>&#160; Along every journey there comes a parting, and while we may meet again in the future, for now we must say &#147;fare well&#148;.&#160; No matter how much we will miss you, you must move on to your new life, and we must carry on with our own.</p>  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Never forget us, as we will never forget you.&#160; Remember: lives may come and go for us, but this family is forever.&#160; We will always cherish you in our hearts, and carry our memory of you in our eternal souls. Now let us each make an offering to our departed friend, to strengthen him along his new journey.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>(The Priest leads everyone in making an offering of energy for the deceased. Those with items to leave in the coffin or at the graveside can charge these with the offering of energy. Others may simply hold out their upturned hands. In single file, each should leave their offerings at the memorial. If the rite is not being held at graveside or coffin, then the memorial is likely to be a photo of the deceased or a simple shrine set up to honor the dead person&#146;s memory.&#160; When everyone has had a chance to leave their offering, the Priest closes the ceremony with the Family Prayer.)</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b></p>  
<p><DIR>May we endure together peacefully.<br> May we enjoy each lifetime as it comes.<br> May we benefit each other as we better ourselves,<br> And may we always find one another,<br> In every time and in every place,<br> To share this companionship and to celebrate this bond.</DIR></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><b>Priest: </b>Go forth in darkness and light.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
