# PART II. THE PROBLEMS OF THE UNIVERSE

### INTRODUCTION. THE SECRET OF ALL THINGS

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> Triunity of Father, Son and Holy
Spirit reflected and expressed in the triunities of space, matter, time
and man is the secret of the universe. It is the key to the many riddles
of the universe. It shows why things are as they are, and that they did
not happen so. It shows why space is what it is, of three dimensions. It
shows why matter is what it is, of energy, motion and phenomena, with
all their relationships. It shows why time is as it is, composed of
future, present and past. It shows why man is made as he is. It may show
the great principle of unity in all things. It should illumine the
relationship of space, matter and time. It may well cast light on the
mysterious principles of existence, of change, and of reality, in the
universe. The being of God, as the central fact of the universe, may
explain these universal things. It may make them clear, not as we
ourselves paradoxically try to make mysteries clear, by involved effort,
and intricacies of thought, and abstruse analysis, but by the broad,
self-evident Fact of a Triune God.

It is a world principle. It means for you, if you will, a new system of
thought, a new way of thinking, based on the being of God and of His
world.

It is, if you will, a true philosophy of things physical and things
human.

But better, it is a new vision of the universe, in the light of the
Triune Being of God.
