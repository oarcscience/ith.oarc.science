<P>
These are the key writings of the Unity Church, a major New Thought
movement.
Most of the early writings of Charles Fillmore, the founder of Unity,
are in the public domain in the US because they were not
renewed in a timely fashion.
The two books below published prior to 1923 are in the public domain in the US
because of their date of publication.
A search of the online copies of US copyright office records for this
period showed no renewals for the rest of these works.
</P>
<P>
The bibliographic data for the listings below is speculative,
based on a search of online library catalogs.
I would appreciate any information about the
edition which these etexts were created from, specifically
the date of original publication.
