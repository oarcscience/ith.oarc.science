*The Revealing Word*, by Charles Fillmore, \[1959\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###  

The Revealing Word offers Truth students the metaphysical meanings and
uses of words and phrases that frequently appear in Unity publications,
and many that appear in the Bible. Whereas Unity's Metaphysical Bible
Dictionary explains the esoteric meanings of scriptural proper names,
The Revealing Word is devoted mostly to common names. In addition to
words that have religious significance, hundreds of words that are in
everyday use appear in this book. Thus the reader is given inner
meanings that he or she can apply to daily living. All things in life
are expressed in words. Equipped with the inner meanings of words, a
person can control all the issues of his or her life, from the
insignificant to the great. (Bible quotations in this book are from the
American Standard Version.)
