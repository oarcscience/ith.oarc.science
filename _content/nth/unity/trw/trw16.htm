<p>obedience, spiritual--Obedience comes through understanding man's relation to God. When we show forth wisdom and purity and the perfect Principle that is God, we are obedient to Him. </p> 
<p>object of man's existence--The mortal concept of the object of man's existence is personal pleasure and profit. The spiritual concept is to express God. </p> 
<p>obsession--All conscious thought may become subconscious. An error may be held in mind until it is firmly fixed or crystallized and so strong that it takes control of a man. Such controlling mental states are false states of consciousness. Anger, jealousy, greed, appetite, passion are traits that, when allowed to become dominant, are obsessions, and are the "demons" that are to be cast out. </p> 
<p>occultism--The belief that secret and mysterious powers can control the visible world. This procedure is not the way of the Christ Mind. "For there is nothing hid, save that it should be manifested; neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light" (Mark 4:22). </p> 
<p>offerings, freewill--"Freely ye received, freely give" (Matt. 10:8) is a law of life, and all must conform to it in order to realize their highest good and to receive abundantly. Giving measures the receiving. </p> 
<p>oil, anointing--The thought of love, which is poured </p> 
<p>
<p><a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="green">p. 142</font></A></p></p> 
<p>over anything, making it holy or a perfect whole. "Love . . . is the fulfillment of the law" (Rom. 13:10). </p> 
<p>ointment--Symbolizes affirmation of peace, poise, and gladness. </p> 
<p>ointment in alabaster cruse--The conserved nerve fluid that is stored up in the secret recesses of the body. </p> 
<p>ointment, precious--Fragrance of love with which understanding (feet) is often bathed. </p> 
<p>old age--A false belief deeply imbedded in the race mind. It accepts biological law as the ultimate for man instead of the law of God--which is eternal life in the body. </p> 
<p>Omega--(see Alpha and Omega) </p> 
<p>omnipotence--Infinite power. God is infinite power. All the power there is. All-powerful. </p> 
<p>omnipresence--God is Mind. The one Mind contains all, and all ideas exist in the one Mind. God is everywhere present. There is no place where God is not. He is in all, through all, and around all. Omnipresence is a spiritual realm that can be penetrated only through the most highly accelerated mind action, as in prayer. </p> 
<p>omniscience--God as omniscience is all-knowing, all-knowledge. </p> 
<p>omniscient--All-knowing; infinite knowledge and wisdom. Divine Mind is omniscient. It knows all. </p> 
<p>one life and one intelligence--There is one Spirit; one principle of life, love, intelligence, and goodness in, through, and over all, even God, the good omnipotent. </p> 
<p>one Mind--There is but one Mind. Every individual and the various phases of character that make that individual are but states of consciousness in the one Mind. </p> 
<p>one presence and one power--God, Spirit, is the only presence in the universe, and is the only power. He is in, through, and around all creation as its life and sustaining power. </p> 
<p>one Spirit-Mind--God is the one Spirit-Mind in which </p> 
<p>
<p><a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="green">p. 143</font></A></p></p> 
<p>all ideas of life, love, substance, intelligence, and power originate. </p> 
<p>opposition in consciousness--The effort of old states of mind to continue exercising dominion in the face of new ideas becoming active in mind. </p> 
<p>optimism--The inclination to expect good; the practice of seeing God (All-Good) everywhere. A sturdy belief in the goodness of reality. </p> 
<p>order--The divine idea of order is the idea of adjustment, and as this is established in man's thought, his mind and affairs will be at one with the universal harmony. </p> 
<p>ordinances of Jehovah--"The ordinances of Jehovah are true, and righteous altogether" (Psalms 19:9). Ordinances are established rules, and here we have the divine law under a slightly different aspect. When a man keeps the law of his being, he is guided into greater sureness and definiteness of understanding. </p> 
<p>organic regeneration--To become conscious of divine substance, affirm your unity with it until you feel it as an exquisite vibration in every part of your body. This is the baptism of the Holy Spirit so often referred to by the apostles, and when you feel it you may know that you are tasting the "hidden manna" (Rev. 2:17), that you have begun organic regeneration that will be completed in immortality in the body, "the body of Christ" (I Cor. 12:27). </p> 
<p>organs of the body--All outward conditions are the result of ideas that have first appeared in mind. The organs of the body are bundles of ideas that have organized themselves about a working center. They have their positive pole in mind, and it is there that we should look for the means to regulate them. </p> 
<p>"our daily bread"--(Matt. 6:11). Our daily bread is the sustenance for spirit, soul, and body. Some of this "daily bread" is appropriated in the form of food. But </p> 
<p>
<p><a name="page_144"><font size="1" color="green">p. 144</font></A></p></p> 
<p>man does "not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" (Matt. 4:4). There is substance in words of Truth, and this substance is appropriated by prayer and meditation on Truth. </p> 
<p>outer understanding--Man's intellectual consciousness that gathers knowledge and substance for personal advancement and gain. This is not true spiritual understanding, but is a hireling, a stranger, so far as concerns the getting of good by waiting on the inner teacher, the Spirit of truth. </p> 
<p>overcome the world--To correct thoughts that fall short of the divine ideal. </p> 
<p>overcomer--One who recognizes the Truth of his being and is renewing his mind and body and affairs by changing his thoughts from the old mortal beliefs to the new as he sees them in Divine Mind. He demonstrates the divine law, not only in surface life but in innermost consciousness. Spiritual power, mastery, and dominion are attained by the overcomer. "He that overcometh, I will give to him to sit down with me in my throne" (Rev. 3:21). </p> 
<p>overcoming--"Gaining superiority; winning" (Webster). Through thought mastery, sense man is overcome. The victorious thought of love defeats the thoughts of hate and fear. "Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33). </p> 
<p>overcoming, spiritual--Dealing with the problems of life in spiritual understanding and demonstrating over error through the keeping of spiritual laws. </p> 
<p>oversoul--The universal Principle, the absolute One, God, Being. The absolute reality. The oversoul is the divine thought man. Jesus is the expressed oversoul of this planet. </p>
