###  John: Chapter 21 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">After these things Jesus manifested himself again to
the  
disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and he manifested himself  
on this wise. 2 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas  
called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the  
sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples. 3 Simon  
Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him,  
We also come with thee. They went forth, and entered into  
the boat; and that night they took nothing. 4 But when day  
was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach: yet the  
disciples knew not that it was Jesus. 5 Jesus therefore  
saith unto them, Children, have ye aught to eat? They  
answered him, No. 6 And he said unto them, Cast the net on  
the right side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast  
therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the  
multitude of fishes. 7 That disciple therefore whom Jesus  
loved said unto Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter  
heard that it was the Lord, he girt his coat about him (for  
he was naked), and cast himself into the sea. 8 But the  
other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not  
far from the land, but about two hundred cubits off),  
dragging the net full of fishes. 9 So when they got out  
upon the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish  
laid thereon, and bread. 10 Jesus saith unto them, Bring of  
the fish which ye have now taken. 11 Simon Peter therefore  
went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a  
hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so  
many, the net was not rent. 12 Jesus saith unto them, Come  
and break your fast. And none of the disciples durst  
inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.  
13 Jesus cometh, and taketh the bread, and giveth them, and  
the fish likewise. 14 This is now the third time that Jesus  
was manifested to the disciples, after that he was risen  
from the dead.

WHEN THE DISCIPLES had toiled all night in their fishing boats without
results, Jesus suddenly appeared on the shore and called to them, "Cast
the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find." The result
was 153 large fishes, so heavy that the net could not be lifted into the
boat, yet it did not break. Man's mind is the net that catches thoughts,
which are the basis of external conditions. The sea is the mental realm
in which man exists. Toil of all kinds is a combination of mental and
physical exertion. When the mind is exalted toil is easy. By using his
mind man invents machinery that relieves him from wearying muscular
labor. In a larger way the spiritual man uses his mind and takes
advantage of divine guidance to lighten his toil.

The net of man's thought works hard and long in the darkness of human
understanding and gains but little, but once the Christ Mind is
perceived and obeyed the net is cast on the "right side," and success
follows. The "right side" is the side on which man realizes the truth
that inexhaustible resources are always present and can be made manifest
by those who exercise their faith in that direction.

Whoever seeks supply through Spirit and submits his cause to the law of
justice and righteousness always succeeds. The reason why men fail to
demonstrate the many promises of divine support is that they cling to
some selfish or unjust thought. "Seek ye first his kingdom, and his
righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you."

The bread and fish that Jesus provided on the

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

shore represents the supply of Spirit for the needs of the body. Not
only does the Father provide for man in the natural world, as by the
draught of fishes, but in the invisible world of substance are elements
that correspond to the material things. Bread symbolizes the substance
of the omnipresent Christ body and fish the capacity of increase that
goes with it. Fish are the most prolific of all living things and aptly
exemplify the ability of increase inherent in the Christ substance.

<span class="small">15 So when they had broken their fast, Jesus saith
to Simon  
Peter, Simon, son of John, lovest thou me more than these?  
He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love  
thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs. 16 He saith to him  
again a second time, Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? He  
saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee.  
He saith unto him, Tend my sheep. 17 He saith unto him the  
third time, Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? Peter was  
grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest  
thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all  
things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto  
him, Feed my sheep. 18 Verily, verily, I say unto thee,  
When thou wast young, thou girdest thyself, and walkedst  
whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou  
shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee,  
and carry thee whither thou wouldest not. 19 Now this he  
spake, signifying by what manner of death he should glorify  
God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow  
me. 20 Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus  
loved following; who also leaned back on his breast at the  
supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee? 21  
Peter therefore  
</span>

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man  
do? 22 Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I  
come, what is that to thee? follow thou me. 23 This saying  
therefore went forth among the brethren, that that disciple  
should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, that he should  
not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is  
that to thee?  
24 This is the disciple that beareth witness of these  
things, and wrote these things: and we know that his  
witness is true.  
25 And there are also many other things which Jesus did,  
the which if they should be written every one, I suppose  
that even the world itself would not contain the books that  
should be written.

Three times Jesus asked Simon Peter, "Lovest thou me?" Peter's spiritual
advancement hinged on his possession of love, and the test of love is
its willingness to serve. It is quite evident that Jesus was trying to
teach Peter that if he loved truly he would serve.

Faith must be established in love and must work by love; and every
faculty of man must be established in love and work by love if perfect
harmony and good are to be realized. Faith established in love and
working by love will remain steadfast at all times, under all
circumstances; it will be our sustaining power during our every hour of
need.

In verse 18 of this chapter Jesus explains further what He meant by His
questioning. Faith (Peter), when it first begins to awaken to the Christ
ideal, sees the unlimited possibilities that are presented in this new
life; it realizes that it can bring into manifestation anything that may
be desired. In its more

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

mature state it realizes the necessity for service in a universal sense.
The giving up of the personal self (with the consequent working from a
universal standpoint) is the death whereby we are to glorify God.
However, laying hold of Spirit and its power should accompany the denial
of self.

Faith (symbolized by Peter) is the faculty on which depends continuous
supply; hence Peter is challenged with the thought of love toward Christ
three times. Faith must be in loving communion with the Christ Mind in
order to draw down to the thoughts (sheep) the necessary supply. Man
does not live by bread alone but by words and thoughts from God. These
come into consciousness through mental and spiritual laws. Peter's three
successive affirmations of love represent fulfillment of the close
Christ union in spirit, soul, and body. Faith at the beginning is
wistful, vigorous, vacillating, but in its maturity it gives itself
wholly to Spirit and is willing to die to self. This is the "manner of
death" by which faith glorifies God: being absorbed into the Divine
Mind.

Through repeated affirmations of love toward Christ, man develops a
consciousness of divine love that abides at the heart center and fills
the whole body with ecstasy. This consciousness is "the disciple whom
Jesus loved."

Jesus revealed the mind of the Father. This mind is the life and
intelligence of man as well as the substance that provides for all his
needs. This providing power of the Father, Jesus brought out
prominently, and He showed in various ways how

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

easy it is to obtain supply by trusting God. This teaching is not an
encouragement to man to be idle, but rather to be active and trustful,
constantly looking to Spirit instead of matter as the source of his
good.

The actual resurrection of Jesus in a body that corresponds to the
physical is not a subject open to debate by the followers of Jesus
Christ. The historical evidence is ample to convince any unprejudiced
mind. However, the study of the constituent parts of man, his spirit,
soul, and body, reveals man's innate capacity to overcome the
disintegrating effects of error thinking and living, and his ability, by
conforming to the standards laid down by Jesus, to destroy the seeds of
death and implant health and eternal life in his body.

To the oft-repeated question "If Jesus resurrected His physical body why
is He not visible here among us?" we would say that Jesus overcame the
sins that caused our original fall from the perfect body of the Adamic
man to the diseased and dying body in which the race is now existing.
When we have purified our mind and body and cast out every evil thought,
our body will become transparent to human sight, as is Jesus' body. The
idea that a transparent body is thin air, a ghost, is wholly wrong.
Science says that the invisible electrical units composing the atom are
millions of times more powerful than any visible thing. When the atomic
energy in the atomic bomb was released great cities were destroyed.
Jesus told His followers that when they were gathered in that upper room
in Jerusalem the

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

Holy Spirit would descend upon them with power; and they were
transformed from ignorant men into linguists of unbelievable ability.

Paul says, "Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind." When we
accomplish this transformation we shall see Jesus as He is and as we
must all be in the resurrection from the dead and dying body in which we
are now functioning. This is not to be accomplished by a great miracle
at some appointed time in the future, but day by day we shall be
resurrected out of the darkness of sense into the glorious light of
Spirit.
