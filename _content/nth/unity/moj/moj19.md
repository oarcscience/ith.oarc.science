###  John: Chapter 17 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">These things spake Jesus; and lifting up his eyes
to  
heaven, he said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son,  
that the Son may glorify thee: 2 even as thou gavest him  
authority over all flesh, that to all whom thou hast given  
him, he should give eternal life. 3 And this is life  
eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and  
him whom thou didst send, even Jesus Christ.  
</span>

</div>

IN THIS SCRIPTURE Jesus was asking of the Father as never before. To
glorify means to magnify with praise, to enhance with spiritual
splendor. to adorn. Jesus was asking for a full and complete unification
of His consciousness with that of the Father. Jesus realized that He had
been given all authority over the flesh. He was holding the realization
not only for His own glorification but also for that of His disciples.
Jesus realized that in this union a full understanding of God and His
laws would be revealed, which would naturally make clear to Him the way
of eternal life.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">4 I glorified thee on the earth, having accomplished
the  
work which thou hast given me to do. 5 And now, Father,  
glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I  
had with thee before the world was. 6 I manifested thy name  
unto the men whom thou gavest me out of the world: thine  
they were, and thou gavest them to me; and they have kept  
thy word. 7 Now they know that all things whatsoever thou  
hast given me are from thee: 8 for the words which thou  
gavest me I have given unto them; and they received them,  
and knew of a truth that I came forth from thee, and they  
believed  
</span>

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

that thou didst send me. 9 I pray for them: I pray not for  
the world, but for those whom thou hast given me; for they  
are thine: 10 and all things that are mine are thine, and  
thine are mine: and I am glorified in them. 11 And I am no  
more in the world, and these are in the world, and I come  
to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast  
given me, that they may be one, even as we are. 12 While I  
was with them, I kept them in thy name which thou hast  
given me: and I guarded them, and not one of them perished,  
but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be  
fulfilled. 13 But now I come to thee; and these things I  
speak in the world, that they may have my joy made full in  
themselves. 14 I have given them thy word; and the world  
hateth them, because they are not of the world, even as I  
am not of the world. 15 I pray not that thou shouldest take  
them from the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from  
the evil one. 16 They are not of the world, even as I am  
not of the world. 17 Sanctify them in the truth: thy word  
is truth. 18 As thou didst send me into the world, even so  
sent I them into the world. 19 And for their sakes I  
sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be  
sanctified in truth. 20 Neither for these only do I pray,  
but for them also that believe on me through their word; 21  
that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, art in me,  
and I in thee, that they also may be in us: that the world  
may believe that thou didst send me. 22 And the glory which  
thou hast given me I have given unto them; that they may be  
one, even as we are one; 23 I in them, and thou in me, that  
they may be perfected into one; that the world may know  
that thou didst send me, and lovedst them, even as thou  
lovedst me. 24 Father, I desire that they also whom thou  
hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold  
my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me  
before  

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

the foundation of the world. 25 O righteous Father, the  
world knew thee not, but I knew thee; and these knew that  
thou didst send me; 26 and I made known unto them thy name,  
and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou  
lovedst me may be in them, and I in them.

Jesus must have been the product of a former cycle of time, and He had
previously made the perfect union in the invisible with the Father.

In proportion as people understand and have faith in Jesus as their
actual Saviour from sin, and in proportion as they are set free from
appetite, passion, jealousy, prejudice, and all selfishness, they
experience wholeness of mind and body as the result. The ultimate result
of this knowledge and of daily practice in overcoming (even as Jesus
Himself overcame) will be a new race that will demonstrate eternal
life--the lifting up of the whole man--spirit, soul, and body--into the
Christ consciousness of oneness with the Father. This is indeed true
glorification. By means of the reconciliation, glorification, and
at-one-ment that Jesus re-established between God and man we can regain
our original estate as sons of God here upon earth.

To comprehend this glorification requires a deeper insight into creative
processes than the average man and woman have attained, not because they
lack the ability to understand but because they have submerged their
thinking powers in a grosser thought stratum. So only those who study
Being from the standpoint of pure mind can come into an understanding of
the transfiguration and of the part

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

that Jesus played in opening the way for humanity to enter into the
glory that was theirs before the world was formed.

In its highest form, prayer is an exalted state of consciousness in
which self-interest is lost in the desire to do good to everybody. Jesus
always prayed the unselfish prayer. There are as many kinds of prayer as
there are people in the universe. Those who pray for some personal good
have no conception of the ecstasy of those who utterly forget self in
their supplications for the good to be given to others. Yet all kinds of
prayers are fulfilled. "Ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done
unto you."

Those who spend much time in the Spirit come to be so much in love with
it that they find it hard to endure the selfishness of the world, which
they are tempted to leave entirely. Mystics and spiritual adepts
withdraw to caves and the wilderness, as far from the haunts of men as
they can get, because of the evil they see and feel so vividly. Then it
becomes a real struggle to keep the self in the world. It is not right
for one who has found this divine Truth within himself to withdraw from
those who are ignorant of it and enjoy his riches alone. We should not
think of being taken out of the world, but rather should we strive to
keep our faculties from evil.

When we have found our being in God, we are no longer identified with
the world; our interest is in spiritual things, and all our prayers are
lifted up. "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world."
Through our intense realization of

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

the eternal good and our unity with it we become so saturated with the
thought of good that we are impregnable to evil. Thus we find that the
doctrine of sanctification is based on Truth, and that it is possible
for us to become so good in purpose that everything we do will turn to
good. But we must certainly sanctify ourselves in Christ and
persistently send forth the word of purity and unselfishness to every
faculty in order to demonstrate it. We must not confine our prayer for
perfection to ourselves alone but make it for them also that believe on
Christ "through their word."

The realization of divine unity is the highest that we can attain. This
is true glory, the blending and merging of the whole being into Divine
Mind. "I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one."

This merging of God and man does not mean the total obliteration of
man's consciousness but its glorification or expansion into that of the
divine. This is taught in Hindu philosophy as the absorption of the soul
into Nirvana, which has been erroneously interpreted as the total loss
of individual consciousness instead of its majestic expansion.
