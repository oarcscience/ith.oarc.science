###  John: Chapter 18 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth
with his  
disciples over the brook Kidron, where was a garden, into  
which he entered, himself and his disciples. 2 Now Judas  
also, who betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus oft-times  
resorted thither with his disciples. 3 Judas then, having  
received the band of soldiers, and officers from the chief  
priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and  
torches and weapons.  
</span>

</div>

THE NAME KIDRON means "turbid stream." Kidron represents the current of
confused thoughts that sometimes pour in upon us when we try to go into
the silence. The "garden" locates the current in the world of universal
thought. But this is a small matter compared with the activity of the
great personal self in the subjective consciousness, Judas, who "knew
the place," and took advantage of its darkness to capture the I AM. He
came with a "band" (combative thoughts) and "officers from the chief
priests and the Pharisees" (the idea of priestly authority and religious
guidance from the standpoint of the letter), bearing "lanterns and
torches and weapons" (light of the intellect, the torch of reason, and
the force of circumstances).

Judas, representing the life principle, at this phase of overcoming is
not fully redeemed from carnal thoughts and desires.

When Jesus went "over the brook Kidron" and entered the garden of
Gethsemane, He passed in His own consciousness from the without to the
within.

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">4 Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were
coming  
upon him, went forth, and saith unto them, Whom seek ye? 5  
They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto  
them, I am he. And Judas also, who betrayed him, was  
standing with them. 6 When therefore he said unto them, I  
am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground. 7 Again  
therefore he asked them, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus  
of Nazareth. 8 Jesus answered, I told you that I am he; if  
therefore ye seek me, let these go their way: 9 that the  
word might be fulfilled which he spake, Of those whom thou  
hast given me I lost not one. 10 Simon Peter therefore  
having a sword drew it, and struck the high priest's  
servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant's name  
was Malchus. 11 Jesus therefore said unto Peter, put up the  
sword into the sheath: the cup which the Father hath given  
me, shall I not drink it?  
</span>

</div>

For the moment the personal will (the officers and soldiers, the
executors of man-made laws) is here overcome. The second question is of
the personality and milder. Jesus realizes that the time has come for
Him to prove that the principles of almighty God are invulnerable and
must stand. The I AM faced the condition unafraid (Jesus representing
the I AM, answered, "I am he").

Your faith in the righteousness of your cause (Peter) may lead you to
combat the ruling religious thoughts, and in your impetuosity you resent
their counsel (Malchus, counselor) and deny their capacity to receive
Truth (cut off the right ear); but good judgment and a broad
comprehension of the

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

divine overcoming through which you are passing will cause you to adopt
pacific means. "Put up the sword into the sheath."

"The cup which the Father hath given me" is the consciousness of eternal
life. This must be attained by a crucifixion, an utter "crossing out,"
of the personal self, both on its objective and subjective planes of
volition; hence "they led him to Annas" that other processes of the
divine law might be carried out.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">12 So the band and the chief captain, and the
officers of  
the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him, 13 and led him to  
Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, who was  
high priest that year. 14 Now Caiaphas was he that gave  
counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man  
should die for the people.  
</span>

</div>

"The band and the chief captain, and the officers of the Jews" are found
in the intellectual realm, and it is before this tribunal that the
Christ appears, to be tested and tried. Annas was a leading factor in
the persecutions at the time of the ministry and crucifixion of Jesus.
He represents intellectual opposition to spiritual Truth. His son-in-law
Caiaphas, the high priest, represents a ruling religious thought force
that is also entirely intellectual. He belongs to the religious world of
forms and ceremonies, the "letter" of the word. The ruthlessness of
these men shows how a merely formal religion will persecute and attempt
to kill the inner Christ Spirit and all that pertains to it.

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">15 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did
another  
disciple. Now that disciple was known unto the high priest,  
and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high  
priest; 16 but Peter was standing at the door without. So  
the other disciple, who was known unto the high priest,  
went out and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought  
in Peter. 17 The maid therefore that kept the door saith  
unto Peter, Art thou also one of this man's disciples? He  
saith, I am not. 18 Now the servants and the officers were  
standing there, having made a fire of coals; for it was  
cold; and they were warming themselves: and Peter also was  
with them, standing and warming himself.  
</span>

</div>

Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another apostle. Simon Peter
(symbolizing the faculty of faith) and the "other disciple" (John,
symbolizing love) always sustain and support the I AM man in every
trial.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">19 The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his
disciples,  
and of his teaching. 20 Jesus answered him, I have spoken  
openly to the world; I ever taught in synagogues, and in  
the temple, where all the Jews come together; and in secret  
spake I nothing. 21 Why askest thou me? ask them that have  
heard me, what I spake unto them: behold, these know the  
things which I said. 22 And when he had said this, one of  
the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand,  
saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? 23 Jesus  
answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the  
evil: but if well, why smitest thou me? 24 Annas therefore  
sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.  
25 Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They  
said therefore unto him, Art thou also  
</span>

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

one of his disciples? He denied, and said, I am not. 26 One  
of the servants of the high priest, being a kinsman of him  
whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the  
garden with him? 27 Peter therefore denied again: and  
straightway the cock crew.  

</div>

The high priest who questioned Jesus symbolizes a form of religious
thoughts in man that follows the set rule of the letter of the law with
little or no thought of its inner spiritual importance. Jesus (here
representing the Christ) sets forth the Truth in plain, concise
language, which however has no significance for the person functioning
on the natural-religious plane of existence.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">28 They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into
the  
Praetorium: and it was early; and they themselves entered  
not into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled,  
but might eat the passover. 29 Pilate therefore went out  
unto them, and saith, What accusation bring ye against this  
man? 30 They answered and said unto him, If this man were  
not an evil-doer, we should not have delivered him up unto  
thee. 31 Pilate therefore said unto them, Take him  
yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews  
said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to  
death: 32 that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which  
he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should die.  
</span>

</div>

The Praetorium symbolizes a state of despotism, where force and cruelty
and tyranny exist. The Jews, symbolizing intellectual spirituality,
would because of their religious traditions turn the Jesus over to
barbarians to be crucified.

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

The Jewish priesthood taught persecution as the unavoidable heritage of
their race; even Jesus told His followers that they would suffer
persecution when they taught His doctrine. At the age of thirteen a
Jewish boy is considered a man ready to meet "persecution" and receives
the blessing of the rabbi. Although it is true that the spiritual mind
and the mortal are at war, metaphysicians see that the persecution of
the Jews in every land is the result of the affirmation of the law of
persecution by those with the power of the word. "Every idle word that
men shall speak, they shall give account thereof."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">33 Pilate therefore entered again into the
Praetorium, and  
called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the  
Jews? 34 Jesus answered, Sayest thou this of thyself, or  
did others tell it thee concerning me? 35 Pilate answered,  
Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests  
delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? 36 Jesus  
answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom  
were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I  
should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom  
not from hence. 37 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou  
a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king.  
To this end have I been born, and to this end am I come  
into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.  
Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. 38 Pilate  
saith unto him, What is truth?  
And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews,  
and saith unto them, I find no crime in him. 39 But ye have  
a custom, that I should release unto you one at the  
passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the  
King of the Jews? 40  
</span>

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

They cried out therefore again, saying, Not this man, but  
Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.  

</div>

The Jews and the high priests and the officers who represent
intellectual religious thought forces continued to work for Jesus'
execution because they realized within their hearts that He was indeed a
King, and they feared His spiritual power. The point to be considered by
every follower of Jesus is His continued assertion that He is a King,
right in the face of the desertion of His subjects and His imminent
death; "a king! aye, a king! and every inch a king."

Barabbas was a prisoner charged with insurrection and murder. He was
held at Jerusalem, and the Jews demanded that he be released instead of
Jesus.

Metaphysically Barabbas represents the adverse consciousness (rebellion
and hatred) to which man gives himself when he allows himself to oppose
the Christ. Man gives free rein to this adverse consciousness when he
would destroy the Christ or true spiritual I AM in himself, since it is
through the Christ alone that an overcoming can be gained over the
Adversary. This adverse state of thought (Barabbas) is of its father the
Devil.
