<p>
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the<br> sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias. 2 And a great<br> multitude followed him, because they beheld the signs which<br> he did on them that were sick. 3 And Jesus went up into the<br> mountain, and there he sat with his disciples. 4 Now the<br> passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand. 5 Jesus<br> therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great<br> multitude cometh unto him, saith unto Philip, Whence are we<br> to buy bread, that these may eat? 6 And this he said to<br> prove him: for he himself knew what he would do. 7 Philip<br> answered him, Two hundred shillings' worth of bread is not<br> sufficient for them, that every one may take a little. 8<br> One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith<br> unto him, 9 There is a lad here, who hath five barley<br> loaves, and two fishes: but what are these among so many?<br> 10 Jesus said, Make the people sit down. Now there was much<br> grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about<br> five thousand. 11 Jesus therefore took the loaves; and<br> having given thanks, he distributed to them that were set<br> down; likewise also of the fishes as much as they would. 12<br> And when they were filled, he saith unto his disciples,<br> Gather up the broken pieces which remain over, that nothing<br> be lost. 13 So they gathered them up, and filled twelve<br> baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves,<br> which remained over unto them that had eaten. 14 When<br> therefore the people saw the sign which he did, they said,<br> This is of a truth the prophet that cometh into the world.<br> </small></div></p> </p> 
<p>WE INCREASE our vitality by blessing and giving thanks in spirit. To bring about this increase efficiently we must understand the anatomy of the soul and mind centers in the body. </p> 
<p>It has been found by experience that a person increases </p> 
<p>
<p><a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="green">p. 68</font></A></p></p> 
<p>his blessings by being grateful for what he has. Gratitude even on the mental plane is a great magnet, and when gratitude is expressed from the spiritual standpoint it is powerfully augmented. The custom of saying grace at the table has its origin in man's attempt to use this power of increase. </p> 
<p>A woman who had been left with a large family and no visible means of support related in an experience meeting how wonderfully this law had worked in providing food for her children. In her extremity she had asked the advice of one who understood the law, and she had been told to thank God silently for abundant supply on her table, regardless of appearances. She and her children began doing this, and in a short time the increase of food was so great at times that it astonished them. Her grocer's bill was met promptly, and in most marvelous ways the family was supplied with food. Never after that time did they lack. </p> 
<p>In all its work the I AM (Christ) uses the faculties of the mind. The I AM is Spirit, and it cannot move directly on substance or formed states of consciousness. It uses the spiritual faculties as its agents. The name Philip means "power," and Jesus appealed to Philip to know how these hungry "thoughts" or people were to be fed. Jesus did this to "prove him." This means that power is still under the limitations of sense. It looks on the visible supply and judges its capacity from that viewpoint. Andrew (strength), brother of Peter (faith), has a slight perception of true supply on the seven-sense </p> 
<p>
<p><a name="page_69"><font size="1" color="green">p. 69</font></A></p></p> 
<p>plane of consciousness (represented as the lad with five loaves and two fishes). This is a good beginning for the I AM. If you have a consciousness of the capacity that is involved in the natural man's sevenfold nature, you have a good foundation on which to build the twelvefold or spiritual man. </p> 
<p>Having quickened your idea of power and strength in universal Spirit, you "sit down" or center your forces within you and begin to bless and give thanks. In divine order you make connection with the universal, vital energy of Being and fill your whole consciousness with vitality. The surplus energy settles back into the various centers as reserve force (the twelve baskets that remained over). Thus you learn to live by "the living bread which came down out of heaven," the very flesh or substance of eternal life. </p> 
<p>Jesus and His disciples were on a mountain when this great increase of substance took place, which indicates a high state of consciousness. An eminent British scientist, Sir James Jeans, says that it may be that the gods that determine our fates are our own minds acting on our brain cells and through them on the world about us. Here is stated a profound truth that, accepted and tested, will demonstrate supply to meet every need. Science says that we live in an invisible ether pregnant with the essence of all visible things, that this essence is wrapped up in the atom, and that it awaits an as yet undiscovered law to set it free. Jesus knew the law and through Him we may know it. In World War II science used this power in the destructive atom bomb. Jesus used </p> 
<p>
<p><a name="page_70"><font size="1" color="green">p. 70</font></A></p></p> 
<p>it constructively in feeding the five thousand. </p> 
<p>
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>15 Jesus therefore perceiving that they were about to come<br> and take him by force, to make him king, withdrew again<br> into the mountain himself alone.<br> </small></div></p> </p> 
<p>Spirit always has the power and the ability to handle any situation. Jesus knew His time had not yet come. He had not yet developed the spiritual power necessary to meet the many demands made on Him. The way out was to withdraw from public work for a season. Those who are evolving spiritually know whether or not they are equal to certain demands made on them, and they withdraw to the within for further spiritual realization and power. </p> 
<p>
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>16 And when evening came, his disciples went down unto the<br> sea; 17 and they entered into a boat, and were going over<br> the sea unto Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had<br> not yet come to them. 18 And the sea was rising by reason<br> of a great wind that blew. 19 When therefore they had rowed<br> about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they behold Jesus<br> walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the boat: and<br> they were afraid. 20 But he saith unto them, It is I; be<br> not afraid. 21 They were willing therefore to receive him<br> into the boat: and straightway the boat was at the land<br> whither they were going.<br> </small></div></p> </p> 
<p>To walk on the sea as Jesus did, without sinking down into the waves, required established faith in the power of Spirit. </p> 
<p>We cannot walk on the waves of life in our </p> 
<p>
<p><a name="page_71"><font size="1" color="green">p. 71</font></A></p></p> 
<p>own personal strength. If we remember to call on the strength of Christ we are sustained by unlimited power, by the real self. </p> 
<p>
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>22 On the morrow the multitude that stood on the other side<br> of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, save<br> one, and that Jesus entered not with his disciples into the<br> boat, but that his disciples went away alone 23 (howbeit<br> there came boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where<br> they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks): 24<br> when the multitude therefore saw that Jesus was not there,<br> neither his disciples, they themselves got into the boats,<br> and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus. 25 And when they<br> found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him,<br> Rabbi, when camest thou hither? 26 Jesus answered them and<br> said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not<br> because ye saw signs, but because ye ate of the loaves, and<br> were filled. 27 Work not for the food which perisheth, but<br> for the food which abideth unto eternal life, which the Son<br> of man shall give unto you: for him the Father, even God,<br> hath sealed. 28 They said therefore unto him, What must we<br> do, that we may work the works of God? 29 Jesus answered<br> and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye<br> believe on him whom he hath sent. 30 They said therefore<br> unto him, What then doest thou for a sign, that we may see,<br> and believe thee? what workest thou? 31 Our fathers ate the<br> manna in the wilderness; as it is written, He gave them<br> bread out of heaven to eat. 32 Jesus therefore said unto<br> them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, It was not Moses that<br> gave you the bread out of heaven; but my Father giveth you<br> the true bread out of heaven. 33 For the bread of God is<br> that which cometh down out of heaven, and giveth life unto<br> the world. 34 They said therefore unto him, Lord, evermore<br> give us this bread. 35 Jesus said<br> 
<p><a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="green">p. 72</font></A></p>unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me<br> shall not hunger, and he that believeth on me shall never<br> thirst. 36 But I said unto you, that have seen me, and yet<br> believe not. 37 All that which the Father giveth me shall<br> come unto me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise<br> cast out. 38 For I am come down from heaven, not to do mine<br> own will, but the will of him that sent me. 39 And this is<br> the will of him that sent me, that of all that which he<br> hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up<br> at the last day. 40 For this is the will of my Father, that<br> every one that beholdeth the Son, and believeth on him,<br> should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the<br> last day.<br> 41 The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he<br> said, I am the bread which came down out of heaven. 42 And<br> they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose<br> father and mother we know? how doth he now say, I am come<br> down out of heaven? 43 Jesus answered and said unto them,<br> Murmur not among yourselves. 44 No man can come to me,<br> except the Father that sent me draw him: and I will raise<br> him up in the last day. 45 It is written in the prophets,<br> And they shall all be taught of God. Every one that hath<br> heard from the Father, and hath learned, cometh unto me. 46<br> Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he that is from<br> God, he hath seen the Father. 47 Verily, verily, I say unto<br> you, He that believeth hath eternal life. 48 I am the bread<br> of life. 49 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness,<br> and they died. 50 This is the bread which cometh down out<br> of heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. 51 I am<br> the living bread which came down out of heaven: if any man<br> eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: yea and the<br> bread which I will give is my flesh, for the life of the<br> world.<br> 52 The Jews therefore strove one with another,<br> 
<p><a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="green">p. 73</font></A></p>saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? 53 Jesus<br> therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,<br> Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his<br> blood, ye have not life in yourselves. 54 He that eateth my<br> flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life; and I will<br> raise him up at the last day. 55 For my flesh is meat<br> indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. 56 He that eateth my<br> flesh and drinketh my blood abideth in me, and I in him. 57<br> As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the<br> Father; so he that eateth me, he also shall live because of<br> me. 58 This is the bread which came down out of heaven; not<br> as the fathers ate, and died; he that eateth this bread<br> shall live for ever. 59 These things said he in the<br> synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.<br> </small></div></p> </p> 
<p>Here the multitudes (meaning a multitude of thoughts) are really seeking comfort and consolation ("they themselves got into the boats and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus"). They had entered into that inner conviction of the abiding compassion and restoring power of God. </p> 
<p>In the universal Mind principle, which Jesus called "the Father," there is a substance that also includes the mother or seed of all visible substance. It is the only real substance because it is unchangeable, while the visible substance is in constant transition. </p> 
<p>The origin or source of all substance is the idea of substance. It is purely spiritual and can be apprehended only by the mind. It is never visible to the eye, nor can it be sensed by man through any of the bodily faculties. Bible authorities say that the Almighty God in Genesis should have been translated </p> 
<p>
<p><a name="page_74"><font size="1" color="green">p. 74</font></A></p></p> 
<p>El Shaddai, "the breasted one." Thus God is found to include both the male and the female principle. </p> 
<p>When the mind has centered its attention on this idea of substance long enough and strongly enough, it generates the consciousness of substance, and through the powers of the various faculties of the mind in right relation it can form visible substance. Jesus in this way brought into visibility the loaves and fishes to feed the five thousand. </p> 
<p>But this faculty of dealing with ideas is open to all men and women. It is not given to privileged persons and withheld from all others. </p> 
<p>Jesus knew this, and He also knew that every man must center his attention on this spiritual substance and bring forth its fruits, just as He did. But those whose attention has long been centered in things visible are slow to appreciate this fact. </p> 
<p>Jesus fed the multitude in an easy way, and they followed Him over the sea in boats apparently in order to get more food; at least that is the motive Jesus attributed to them. </p> 
<p>Then He tells them plainly that they must not labor for the food that perishes but for the food that "abideth unto eternal life." </p> 
<p>When they asked how they should do these "works of God" or so-called miracles, He said, "Believe on him whom he hath sent." One translation says, "Believe in him." Man is to believe in the spiritual presence of the living God even as one "sent"; that is, entered into the consciousness. </p> 
<p>All shall attain who believe or have faith in the spiritual source of life. Whoever comes to this Christ </p> 
<p>
<p><a name="page_75"><font size="1" color="green">p. 75</font></A></p></p> 
<p>realm in the heavens all about us will be moved by its will, which is the will of the Father. There will be no loss, no failure in this realm, and whoever enters into the Mind of Spirit will have poured out to him its life essence and be wholly raised up from material conditions when arriving at the "last day" (the last degree of understanding). </p> 
<p>Moses caused manna to fall from heaven to feed the Children of Israel. The body of Christ is a spiritual substance that we incorporate into consciousness through faith out of the heavens of mind. That the food we eat has a spiritual source is proved by those who fast in spiritual faith much longer and easier than those who are forced to starve. </p> 
<p>
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>60 Many therefore of his disciples, when they heard this,<br> said, This is a hard saying; who can hear it? 61 But Jesus<br> knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this,<br> said unto them, Doth this cause you to stumble? 62 What<br> then if ye should behold the Son of man ascending where he<br> was before? 63 It is the spirit that giveth life; the flesh<br> profiteth nothing: the words that I have spoken unto you<br> are spirit, and are life. 64 But there are some of you that<br> believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they<br> were that believed not, and who it was that should betray<br> him. 65 And he said, For this cause have I said unto you,<br> that no man can come unto me, except it be given unto him<br> of the Father.<br> 66 Upon this many of his disciples went back, and walked no<br> more with him. 67 Jesus said therefore unto the twelve,<br> Would ye also go away? 68 Simon Peter answered him, Lord,<br> to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.<br> 69 And we have believed and know that thou art the Holy One<br> of God. 70 Jesus answered them, Did not I<br> 
<p><a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="green">p. 76</font></A></p>choose you the twelve, and one of you is a devil? 71 Now he<br> spake of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for he it was<br> that should betray him, being one of the twelve.<br> </small></div></p> </p> 
<p>Jesus said, "It is the spirit that giveth life; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I have spoken unto you are spirit, and are life." Being, the original fount, is an impersonal principle; but in its work of creation it puts forth an idea that contains all ideas: the Logos, Word, Christ, the Son of God, or spiritual man. This spiritual man or Christ or Word of God is the true inner self of every individual. Man therefore contains within himself the capacities of Being, and through his words uses the creative principle in forming his environment, good or bad. So we make our own heaven or hell. </p> 
<p>The ideas that make words constructive are those of life, love, wisdom, substance, power, strength, and all other ideas that express divine attributes. Words carrying the life idea produce a vitalizing and life-giving effect. Words that express divine love are harmonizing and unifying in their effect. </p> 
<p>Words are made active in the body through their receptivity by the mind and are carried into the body through the subconsciousness by one's thought. Constructive words that renew the body are made a part of the body consciousness by prayer and meditation. These are the words that are Spirit and give life. </p> 
<p>Many people start out to walk in the light of Spirit, to unfold Truth, but they become entangled in their own misgivings and disbelief and therefore </p> 
<p>
<p><a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="green">p. 77</font></A></p></p> 
<p>return to their old limited way of life. </p> 
<p>After these events Jesus went to Galilee (the "whirl of life"), for He did not walk in Judea (praise) because the Jews sought to kill him. The Jews (the Pharisaical Jews in this instance) believed in the letter of the law rather than the spirit. </p>
