<p>
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Jesus therefore six days before the passover came to<br> Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the<br> dead. 2 So they made him a supper there: and Martha served;<br> but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him. 3<br> Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very<br> precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his<br> feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor<br> of the ointment.<br> </small></div></p> </p> 
<p>BETHANY MEANS "a place of fruits," dates, bread, that is, substance. Whenever we make a mental demonstration we get a certain result in our body. This is called the "fruit" of our thought. </p> 
<p>When Jesus went to Bethany He realized the fruit or effect of raising Lazarus; that is, the quickening of certain sleeping energies in His body consciousness. </p> 
<p>This realization is a feast to the soul and body, a filling of the whole man with a sense of satisfaction. Martha, the practical soul, and Mary, the devotional, serve the Master. Martha provides the material necessities and Mary the spiritual, while Lazarus sits at meat (abides as the living substance of the subconsciousness). </p> 
<p>Mary, the devotional side of the soul, is grateful for the awakening of her brother Lazarus, because she depends for her manifestation on the subconscious life that he represents. When the soul is lifted up in prayer and thanksgiving, there follows an outflow of love that fills the whole "house" or body with its odor. The anointing of Jesus' feet represents the willingness of love to serve. When Jesus </p> 
<p>
<p><a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="green">p. 116</font></A></p></p> 
<p>washed the feet of His apostles He said, "He that is . . . greater among you, let him become as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve." </p> 
<p>
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>4 But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, that should<br> betray him, saith, 5 Why was not this ointment sold for<br> three hundred shillings, and given to the poor? 6 Now this<br> he said, not because he cared for the poor; but because he<br> was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put<br> therein. 7 Jesus therefore said, suffer her to keep it<br> against the day of my burying. 8 For the poor ye have<br> always with you; but me ye have not always.<br> 9 The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he<br> was there: and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but<br> that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from<br> the dead. 10 But the chief priests took counsel that they<br> might put Lazarus also to death; 11 because that by reason<br> of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.<br> </small></div></p> </p> 
<p>Judas Iscariot (sense consciousness) is incarnated selfishness, and his every thought is to build up personality. When Mary anoints the feet of Jesus (when love pours out her precious substance, diffusing its essence throughout the whole man), Judas inquires why the ointment was not sold and the proceeds given to the poor. The Judas consciousness believes in poverty and has no understanding of the true law of supply. All that comes into consciousness is selfishly appropriated and dissipated by this thief, yet he produces nothing. Sense consciousness is the enigma of existence, and in it is wrapped up the mystery of individuality. Jesus knew that through this department of His being He would be betrayed, but </p> 
<p>
<p><a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="green">p. 117</font></A></p></p> 
<p>He made no effort to defeat the act of Judas. Sense consciousness betrays man every day, yet it would be unwise wholly to destroy it before its time, because at its foundation it is good; it has simply gone wrong; it "hath a devil." </p> 
<p>Love is the "greatest thing in the world," according to Henry Drummond, who analyzed it in a masterly manner. Jesus acknowledged the power of love when He said, "Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying." When personality is hurt to the death and surrenders all, love pours her balm over every wound and the substance of her sympathy infuses hope and faith into the discouraged soul. A noted mental healer relates that her husband was dying of consumption. She had treated him in every way known to her science without results, when one day in her agony she exclaimed, "I will give my whole life to save you." Immediately, she says, a great flood of substance seemed to roll forth from her heart toward her husband, and from that day he began to improve, and he finally got well. This was the precious ointment of love, poured out for him when he was buried in the consciousness of death, and it resurrected him. Divine Love hath a balm for every ill. </p>

<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>12 On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the<br> feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,<br> 13 took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to<br> meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed is he that cometh<br> in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel. 14 And<br> Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is<br> written,<br> 
<p><a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="green">p. 118</font></A></p>15 Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh,<br> sitting on an ass's colt. 16 These things understood not<br> his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified,<br> then remembered they that these things were written of him,<br> and that they had done these things unto him. 17 The<br> multitude therefore that was with him when he called<br> Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare<br> witness. 18 For this cause also the multitude went and met<br> him, for that they heard that he had done this sign. 19 The<br> Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Behold how ye<br> prevail nothing; lo, the world is gone after him.<br> </small></div></p> </p> 
<p>The triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem and His reception by the multitude represents a transient and external enthusiasm, the result of demonstrations in the outer. This multitude that went forth to meet Him, crying, "Hosanna: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord," did so because they had witnessed the raising of Lazarus. Their homage to Jesus was based on the "signs" that they had witnessed, and not on that deep inner conviction of Truth that attests the sincere followers. </p> 
<p>A large proportion of those who espouse the cause in this day do so from the "signs" standpoint. They have observed some demonstration, and accept the philosophy as they would a new patent medicine, and they change their doctrine as readily as the doser does his drug. </p> 
<p>
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>20 Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up<br> to worship at the feast: 21 these therefore came to Philip,<br> who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying,<br> Sir, we would see Jesus.<br> 
<p><a name="page_119"><font size="1" color="green">p. 119</font></A></p>22 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: Andrew cometh, and<br> Philip, and they tell Jesus. 23 And Jesus answereth them,<br> saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be<br> glorified. 24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a<br> grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by<br> itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit. 25 He<br> that loveth his life loseth it; and he that hateth his life<br> in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. 26 If any<br> man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there<br> shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will the<br> Father honor.<br> </small></div></p> </p> 
<p>Common sense often saves a man from the fanaticism of religious enthusiasm. The Greeks represent the practical side of man's nature. They ask Philip for an interview with Jesus, and Philip tells Andrew. All this means that it is through the power (Philip) and strength (Andrew) in man that the sense reason acts, and when the I AM is called down from its lofty spiritual enthronement to the contemplation of practical life, there is a restoration of equilibrium. Then it recognizes the law of giving its exalted ideality to the earthly consciousness, that it may also be lifted up. To the higher consciousness this seems like the death of an ideal, but it is only a temporary submergence, which has its resurrection in a great increase of life and power. Thus we lose our life in the service of the good, and count it of no value in order to find it again in Spirit. </p> 
<p>
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>27 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father,<br> save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this<br> hour. 28 Father, glorify thy<br> 
<p><a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="green">p. 120</font></A></p>name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, saying, I<br> have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. 29 The<br> multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that<br> it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken to him.<br> 30 Jesus answered and said, This voice hath not come for my<br> sake, but for your sakes.<br> </small></div></p> </p> 
<p>Jesus' mission on earth was to save the race from bondage, from sin, sickness, and death. This Scripture reveals that Jesus had been able to realize the Truth in this regard and that the time was now approaching for the demonstration. In the face of it all, He realized He was on new ground and there was that within Him which was troubled. "Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name." From within Him came the reassuring voice of God: "I have both glorified it [the name] and will glorify it again." This means that Jesus' heavenly credentials were sufficient and that there was nothing to fear. The demonstration must eventually be forthcoming. </p> 
<p>
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>31 Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince<br> of this world be cast out. 32 And I, if I be lifted up from<br> the earth, will draw all men unto myself. 33 But this he<br> said, signifying by what manner of death he should die. 34<br> The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of<br> the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest<br> thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of<br> man? 35 Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a little while<br> is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that<br> darkness overtake you not: and he that walketh in the<br> darkness knoweth not whither he goes. 36 While ye have the<br> light,<br> 
<p><a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="green">p. 121</font></A></p>believe on the light, that ye may become sons of light.<br> </small></div></p> </p> 
<p>The multitude here referred to is the multitude of thoughts within the soul that is endeavoring to lay hold of the laws of spirituality. Jesus' admonition was "Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness overtake you not." </p> 
<p>
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>36 These things spake Jesus, and he departed and hid<br> himself from them. 37 But though he had done so many signs<br> before them, yet they believed not on him: 38 that the word<br> of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake,<br> Lord, who hath believed our report?<br> And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?<br> 39 For this cause they could not believe, for that Isaiah<br> said again,<br> 40 He hath blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart;<br> Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with<br> their heart,<br> And should turn,<br> And I should heal them.<br> 41 These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory; and<br> he spake of him. 42 Nevertheless even of the rulers many<br> believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not<br> confess it, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:<br> 43 for they loved the glory that is of men more than the<br> glory that is of God.<br> </small></div></p> </p> 
<p>By a "prophet" within the soul is understood the capacity to read out of the law and to perceive to what degree the soul can really demonstrate spirituality. It is revealed that in this Scripture the Pharisaical </p> 
<p>
<p><a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="green">p. 122</font></A></p></p> 
<p>intellect was in authority, compelling the soul forces that were beginning to understand Truth but that still loved the glory that is of men more than the glory that is of God to do obeisance to it. </p> 
<p>
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>44 And Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me,<br> believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. 45 And he<br> that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me. 46 I am come<br> a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me may<br> not abide in the darkness. 47 And if any man hear my<br> sayings, and keep them not, I judge him not: for I came not<br> to judge the world, but to save the world. 48 He that<br> rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, hath one that<br> judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same shall judge<br> him in the last day. 49 For I spake not from myself; but<br> the Father that sent me, he hath given me a commandment,<br> what I should say, and what I should speak. 50 And I know<br> that his commandment is life eternal; the things therefore<br> which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto me, so I<br> speak.<br> </small></div></p> </p> 
<p>In this Scripture Jesus (symbolizing the indwelling Christ) is declaring to the whole soul consciousness that the preponderance of power is spiritual. Spiritual character is the rock foundation of Being; therefore He is urging the multitude of thoughts to realize that their redemption comes through decreeing their oneness with Spirit and that the will of God is active in consciousness. </p> 
<p>The realization of divine unity is the highest that we may attain. This is true glory, the blending and merging of the whole being in Divine Mind. "Build yourself into God and you will find yourself in heaven right here and now." </p>
