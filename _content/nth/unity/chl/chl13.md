###  Lesson Eleven Judgment and Justice 

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">1. Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what
judgment  
ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye  
mete, it shall be measured unto you.--Mt. 7:1,2.  
2. And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the  
Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart,  
when he goeth in before Jehovah: and Aaron shall bear the  
judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before  
Jehovah continually--Ex. 28:30.  
3. The Urim and Thummim (Lights and Perfections). These  
were the sacred symbols (worn upon the breastplate of the  
high priest, upon his heart) by which God gave oracular  
responses for the guidance of His People in temporal  
matters. What they were is unknown; they are introduced in  
Exodus without explanation, as if familiar to the  
Israelites of that day. Modern Egyptology supplies us with  
a clue; it tells us that Egyptian high priests in every  
town, who were also its magistrates, wore round their necks  
a jeweled gem bearing on one side the image of Truth, and  
on the other sometimes that of Justice, sometimes that of  
Light. When the accused was acquitted, the judge held out  
the image of him to kiss. In the final judgment Osiris  
wears around his neck the jeweled Justice and Truth. The  
Septuagint translates Urim and Thummim by "Light and  
Truth." Some scholars suppose that they were the twelve  
stones of the breastplate; others that they were two  
additional stones concealed in its fold. Josephus adds to  
these the two sardonyx buttons, worn on the shoulders,  
which he says emitted luminous rays when the response was  
favorable; but the precise mode in which the oracles were  
given is lost in obscurity.--Bible Glossary of Antiquities.

4\. The law as given by Moses is for the guidance of man in the
evolution of his faculties. The figures, personalities, and symbols
represent potentialities developed and undeveloped on various planes of
consciousness. The high priest stands for spiritual man, officiating
between God and sense man. The breastplate in an armor protects the most
vital part, the heart. The heart is love, the affectional consciousness
in man; it may be subject to the force of weak sympathy, unless balanced
by another power in which is discrimination, or judgment.

5\. The breastplate had on it twelve precious stones, representing the
twelve tribes of Israel. This clearly means that the twelve faculties of
the mind must be massed at the great brain center called the solar
plexus. It means that all the intelligence of man's faculties must be
brought into play in the final judgments of the mind. The Urim and
Thummim (Lights and Perfections; under the Egyptian symbology, "Truth
and Justice") are the oracular edicts of Divine Mind that are
intuitively expressed as a logical sequence of the divine principles,
truth and justice.

6\. A modern metaphysician would interpret all this as signifying the
omnipresence of Divine Mind in its perfect idea, Christ. Truth is ready
at all times to give judgment and justice. As God is love, so God is
justice. These qualities are in Divine Mind in unity, but are made
manifest in man's consciousness too often in diversity. It is through
the Christ Mind in

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

the heart that they are unified. When justice and love meet at the heart
center, there are balance, poise, and righteousness. When judgment is
divorced from love, and works from the head alone, there goes forth the
human cry for justice. In his mere human judgment, man is hard and
heartless; he deals out punishment without consideration of motive or
cause, and justice goes awry.

7\. Good judgment, like all other faculties of the mind, is developed
from Principle. In its perfection it is expressed through man's mind,
with all its absolute relations uncurtailed. Man has the right concept
of judgment, and ideally the judges of our courts have that unbiased and
unprejudiced discrimination which ever exists in the Absolute. A
prejudiced judge is abhorred, and a judge who allows himself to be moved
by his sympathies is not considered safe.

8\. The metaphysician finds it necessary to place his judgment in the
Absolute in order to demonstrate its supreme power. This is accomplished
by one's first declaring that one's judgment is spiritual and not
material; that its origin is in God; that all its conclusions are based
on Truth and that they are absolutely free from prejudice, false
sympathy, or personal ignorance. This gives a working center from which
the ego, or I AM, begins to set in order its own thought world. The
habit of judging others, even in the most insignificant matters of daily
life, must be discontinued. "Judge not, that ye be not judged," said
Jesus. The law of judgment works out

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

in a multitude of directions, and if we do not observe it in small
things, we shall find ourselves failing in large.

9\. Judging from the plane of the personal leads into condemnation, and
condemnation is always followed by the fixing of a penalty. We see
faults in others, and pass judgment upon them without considering
motives or circumstances. Our judgment is often biased and prejudiced;
yet we do not hesitate to think of some form of punishment to be meted
out to the guilty one. He may be guilty or not guilty; decision as to
his guilt or innocence rests in the divine law, and we have no right to
pass judgment. In our ignorance we are creating thought forces that will
react upon us. "With what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged." "With
what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you." Whatever thought
you send out will come back to you. This is an unchangeable law of
thought action. A man may be just in all his dealings, yet if he
condemns others for their injustice, that thought action will bring him
into unjust conditions; so it is not safe to judge except in the
Absolute. Jesus said that He judged no man on His own account, but in
the Father; that is, He judged in the Principle. This is the stand which
everyone must take--resting judgment of others in the Absolute. When
this is done the tendency to condemn will grow less and less, until man,
seeing his fellow man as God sees him, will leave him to the Absolute in
all cases where he seems unjust.

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

10\. The great judgment day of Scripture indicates a time of separation
between the true and the false. There is no warrant for the belief that
God sends man to everlasting punishment. Modern interpreters of the
Scripture say that the "hell of fire" referred to by Jesus means simply
a state in which purification is taking place.

11\. The word hell is not translated with clearness sufficient to
represent the various meanings of the word in the original language.
There are three words from which "hell" is derived: Sheol, "the unseen
state"; Hades, "the unseen world"; and Gehenna, "Valley of Hinnom."
These are used in various relations, nearly all of them allegorical. In
a sermon Archdeacon Farrar said: "There would be the proper teaching
about hell if we calmly and deliberately erased from our English Bibles
the three words, 'damnation,' 'hell,' and 'everlasting.' I
say--unhesitatingly I say, claiming the fullest right to speak with the
authority of knowledge--that not one of those words ought to stand any
longer in our English Bible, for, in our present acceptation of them,
they are simply mistranslations." This corroborates the metaphysical
interpretation of Scripture, and sustains the truth that hell is a
figure of speech that represents a corrective state of mind. When error
has reached its limit, the retroactive law asserts itself, and judgment,
being part of that law, brings the penalty upon the transgressor. This
penalty is not punishment, but discipline, and if the transgressor

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

is truly repentant and obedient, he is forgiven in Truth.

12\. Under our civil law, criminals are confined in penitentiaries where
it is intended that order, regular habits, and industry be inculcated,
and that what seems punishment may prove to be educational. Men are
everywhere calling for broader educational methods in our prisons, and
this demand is an acknowledgment of the necessity of purification
through discipline and training in morals. This purifying process is the
penalty taught by Jesus--the judgment passed on sinners--the "hell of
fire." When it is received in the right spirit, this fire burns up the
dross in character and purifies mind and body.

13\. Metaphysicians have discovered that there is a certain relation
between the functions and organs of the body and the ideas in the mind.
The liver seems to be connected with mental discrimination, and whenever
man gets very active along the line of judgment, especially where
condemnation enters in, there is disturbance of some kind in that part
of the organism. A habit of judging others with severity and fixing in
one's mind what the punishment should be causes the liver to become
torpid and to cease its natural action; the complexion becomes muddy as
a result. "There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in
Christ Jesus . . . who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
This statement held in mind, and carried out in thought and act, will
heal liver complaint of that kind. Another form

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

of thought related to judgment is the vacillating of the mind that never
seems to know definitely what is the proper thing to do: "A
double-minded man, unstable in all his ways." There must be singleness
of mind and loyalty to true ideas. Everyone should have definite ideas
of what is just and right, and stand by them. This stimulates the action
of the liver, and often gives so-called bad people good health, because
they are not under self-condemnation. Condemnation in any of its forms
retards freedom of action in the discriminative faculty. When we hold
ourselves in guilt and condemnation, the natural energies of the mind
are weakened and the whole body becomes inert.

14\. The remedy for all that appears unjust is denial of condemnation of
others, or of self, and affirmation of the great universal Spirit of
justice, through which all unequal and unrighteous conditions are
finally adjusted.

15\. Observing the conditions that exist in the world, the just man
would have them righted according to what he perceives to be the
equitable law. Unless such a one has spiritual understanding, he is very
likely to bring upon himself physical disabilities in his efforts to
reform men. If his feelings come to a point of "righteous indignation,"
and he "boils" with anger over the evils of the world, he will cook the
corpuscles of his blood. Jesus gave this treatment for such a mental
condition: "For neither doth the Father judge any man, but he hath given

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

all judgment unto the Son." This Son is the Christ, the Universal
cosmos; to its equity, man should commit the justice that he wishes to
see brought into human affairs. Put all the burdens of the world upon
the one supreme Judge and hold every man, and all the conditions in
which men are involved, amenable to the law of God. By so doing, you
will set into action mind forces powerful and far-reaching.

16\. If you think that you are unjustly treated by your friends, your
employers, your government, or those with whom you do business, simply
declare the activity of the almighty Mind, and you will set into action
mental forces that will find expression in the executors of the law.
This is the most lasting reform to which man can apply himself. It is
much more effective than legislation or any attempt to control unjust
men by human ways.

17\. Jealousy is a form of mental bias that blinds the judgment and
causes one to act without weighing the consequences. This state of mind
causes the liver to act violently one day and to be torpid the next,
finally resulting in a "jaundiced eye" and yellow skin. We speak of one
"blinded by jealousy," or "blinded by prejudice." We do not mean by this
that the physical eyes have been put out, but that the understanding has
been darkened. Whatever darkens the understanding interferes in some way
with the purifying processes of the organism, and the fluids and
pigments are congested and the skin becomes darkened in consequence.

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

18\. The remedy for all this is a dismissal of that poor judgment which
causes one to be jealous, and a fuller trust in the great all-adjusting
justice of God. In this there should be active trust, which is a form of
prayer. The disturbing elements that come into life should be definitely
placed in the hands of God. This is much more than mere doubtful trust,
or negative expectancy that things will be made right. The Spirit of
justice should be appealed to and prayed to with the persistency of an
Elijah, or of the Gentile woman whose importunity was rewarded. When the
metaphysician sits by his patient with closed eyes he is not asleep, but
very much awake to the reality and mental visibility of forces that
enter into and make the conditions of the body. This spiritual activity
is necessary to the demonstration of the law.

19\. Success in the world is largely dependent on good judgment. A
prominent businessman was once asked what he considered the most
valuable trait of mind in an employee, and he replied: "Good judgment."
Everywhere businessmen are looking for people who have judgment equal to
the making of quick decisions, on the spur of the moment. Years ago a
passenger train was wrecked near a little town in Texas. The station
agent in the little town showed his good judgment by settling, right on
the spot, with the injured. He did this without authority from
headquarters, but he showed such excellent judgment that his ability was
recognized and he was

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

rapidly advanced until he became president of one of the largest
railroad systems in the United States.

20\. By clearing your understanding and acknowledging the one supreme
Mind in which is all discrimination, you can cultivate the ability of
your mind to arrive quickly at right conclusions. Take the stand that it
is your inheritance from God to judge wisely and quickly, and do not
depart therefrom by statements of inefficiency in matters of judgment.
When you are in doubt as to the right thing to do in attaining justice
in worldly affairs, ask that the eternal Spirit of justice shall go
forth in your behalf and bring about and restore to you that which is
your very own. Do not ask for anything but your very own under the
righteous law. Some people unconsciously overreach in their desire for
possessions. When they put the matter into the care of Spirit, and
things do not turn out just as they had expected in their self-seeking
way, they are disappointed and rebellious. This will not do under the
spiritual law, which requires that man shall be satisfied with justice
and accept the results, whatever they may be. "There is a divinity that
shapes our ends"; it can be co-operated with by one who believes in
things spiritual, and he will thereby be made prosperous and happy.
