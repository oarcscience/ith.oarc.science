<p>Charles Fillmore was an innovative thinker, a pioneer in metaphysical thought at a time when most religious thought in America was entirely orthodox. He was a lifelong advocate of the open, inquiring mind, and he took pride in keeping abreast of the latest scientific and educational discoveries and theories. Many years ago he wrote, "What you think today may not be the measure for your thought tomorrow"; and it seems likely that were he to compile this book today, he might use different metaphors, different scientific references, and so on. </p> 
<p>Truth is changeless. Those who knew Charles Fillmore best believe that he would like to be able to rephrase some of his observations for today's readers, thus giving them the added effectiveness of contemporary thought. But the ideas themselves--the core of Charles Fillmore's writings--are as timeless now (and will be tomorrow) as when they were first published. </p> 
<p>Charles Fillmore was born on an Indian reservation just outside the town of St. Cloud, Minnesota, on August 22, 1854. He made his transition on July 5, 1948, at Unity Village, Missouri, at the age of 93. To get a sense of history, when Charles was eleven, Abraham Lincoln was assassinated; when Charles died, Harry Truman was President. </p> 
<p>With his wife Myrtle, Charles Fillmore founded the Unity movement and Silent Unity, the international prayer ministry that publishes Daily Word Charles and Myrtle built the worldwide organization that continues their work today, Unity School of Christianity.

<p>millions of people around the world are finding the teachings of Truth discovered and practiced by Charles and Myrtle Fillmore. </p> 
<p>Charles Fillmore was a spiritual pioneer whose impact has yet to be assessed. No lesser leaders than Dr. Norman Vincent Peale and Dr. Emmet Fox were profoundly influenced by him. Dr. Peale borrowed his catchphrase of positive thinking from Charles Fillmore. Emmet Fox was so affected by Fillmore's ideas that he changed his profession. From an engineer, he became the well-known writer and speaker. </p> 
<p>Charles Fillmore--author, teacher, metaphysician, practical mystic, husband, father, spiritual leader, visionary--has left a legacy that continues to impact the lives of millions of people. By his fruits, he is continuously known. </p>
