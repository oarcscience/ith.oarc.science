<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>The Spirit of truth floods me with the light of life, and I<br> am made whole.<br> The Spirit of truth reveals abundant Spirit substance,<br> which I affirm to be the source of my prosperity.<br> </small></div></p> </p> 
<p>AGAIN the Spirit of truth opens our mind to God's law of supply and support, to the existence of a universal etheric thought substance prepared for man's body sustenance by infinite Mind. We have thought that in answer to our prayers God in some mysterious manner brought about the marvelous demonstrations that we had. Now we see that there has been prepared from the beginning an interpenetrating substance that, like a tenuous bread of heaven, showers us with its abundance. </p> 
<p>But we must not only ask but bring the Spirit into consciousness by affirming its abundance to be the source of our prosperity. Then prosperity will begin to be manifested right in the face of apparent lack. Remember the invitation of the Master "Hitherto </p> 
<p>
<p><a name="page_123"><font size="1" color="green">p. 123</font></A></p></p> 
<p>have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be made full." When we greatly desire to be just and honest and in all ways to express only that which is true under the divine law, our soul radiates energy waves into the ether that produce the color blue. The aura around the bodies of sincere, honest persons is usually bright blue or some modification of blue. Blue is nearly always associated with white in representing spiritual ideals. The birth of Jesus was heralded by a bright star in the blue vault of heaven, and the stars in our American flag have a blue background. </p> 
<p>Some persons think that when they quit lying they are demonstrating Truth. This is commendable, but falls short of fulfilling the complete reformation of the Spirit of truth. In the Gospel of John Jesus repeats in chapter after chapter the promise that He will send to those who believe on Him a Comforter, whom He calls "the Spirit of truth." In the 15th chapter we read, "But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall bear witness of me." In the 16th chapter we find these words: "I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into all the truth." "And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth . . . for he abideth with you, and shall be in you." </p>

<p>Never in the history of the world have there been so many religious cults as now. It is "Lo, here! or, There" the world round. To one who is not well grounded in the fundamental principles of Truth this is all very confusing. Jesus warned us to beware of man-made religions: "Go not . . . after them." "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation." "The kingdom of God is within you." </p> 
<p>By exercise of his innate independence man lost his awareness of Spirit and was consequently cast out of the Garden of Eden or "paradise of God." Those of us who are getting an understanding of the divine law are becoming aware again of the Spirit that rules in this wonderful kingdom of the mind. </p> 
<p>The Spirit of truth is the mind of God in its executive capacity; it carries out the divine plan of the originating Spirit. It proceeds from the Father and bears witness of the Son. We have in the operation of our own mind an illustration of how Divine Mind works. When an idea is fully formulated in our mind and we decide to carry it out, our thoughts change their character from contemplative to executive. We no longer plan, but proceed to execute what we have already planned. So God-Mind sends forth its Spirit to carry out in man the divine idea imaged in the Son. </p> 
<p>It is very comforting to know that there is a Spirit co-operating with us in our efforts to manifest God's law. God in His divine perfection has seemed so far removed from our human frailties that we have lost heart. But now we see that Jesus </p> 
<p>
<p><a name="page_125"><font size="1" color="green">p. 125</font></A></p></p> 
<p>taught that God is intimately associated with us in all our life's problems and that we need only ask in His name in order to have all fulfilled. </p> 
<p>The Spirit of truth is God's thought projecting into our mind ideas that will build a spiritual consciousness like that of Jesus. The Spirit of truth watches every detail of our life, and when we ask and by affirmation proclaim its presence, it brings new life into our body and moves us to observe hygienic and dietary laws that restore health. </p>
