###  Metaphysics of Shakespeare Chapter XIII 

IN DISCUSSIONS of Shakespeare and his plays we hear little about what
may be termed the by-products of the great dramatist's mind; for usually
the dramatic incidents of the plays occupy the attention of the reader
to the exclusion of the more subtle threads of philosophy and soul
culture. Shakespeare was a great teacher, and his mind grasped the
salient issues in the practical world in which he lived and often forged
away ahead into realms that modern research and discovery pronounce
miraculous.

Psychological insight is essential in discerning the spiritual wisdom of
Shakespeare. The intellectual reader will miss entirely the references
to a supermind that crop out in all his dramas. Bible readers know that
spiritual things are spiritually discerned. This is also strikingly true
of Shakespeare's works.

In the fantasy "Midsummer Night's Dream" Shakespeare tells how the
imagination gives to airy nothings a local habitation and a name:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I never may believe  
These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.  
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,  
Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend  
More than cool reason ever comprehends.  
The lunatic, the lover, and the poet  
</span>

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

Are of imagination all compact:  
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,  
That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,  
Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:  
The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,  
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;  
And as imagination bodies forth  
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen  
Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing  
A local habitation and a name.  
Such tricks hath strong imagination,  
That, if it would but apprehend some joy,  
It comprehends some bringer of that joy;  
Or in the night, imagining some fear,  
How easy is a bush supposed a bear!  

</div>

In his infancy Shakespeare was baptized in the church, but his
little-known history does not testify to his devotion. However his
writings betray a very deep spiritual understanding. Neither was he a
mystic. The fine understanding of psychology displayed by many of the
Shakespearean characters must have been gained by soul development
attained by the author in previous incarnations.

We should look for the antecedents of Shakespeare among the early church
fathers, where the spiritual man was quickened and the culture of the
soul given supreme attention. There is no record that he was taught in
any schools except those of the village of Stratford, where he was born.
Because of this many have asked, "Where has this man gained wisdom?"

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

The intellectuals have carried this lack of academic background and
evidence of great supermind ability so far that they have assumed that
some other person, notably Lord Bacon, is the author of Shakespeare's
plays. The claim rests on very flimsy proofs and is not at all accepted
by those who discern the capacity of the soul to attain understanding
and carry it forward from one incarnation to another.

The claim that Shakespeare was not a scholar must be admitted. He made
numerous errors of which a scholar would not be guilty. But Shakespeare
was a genius of the people, not a pedant. He forged his way beyond the
boundaries of the cultured intellect into the realms of fantasy and
mysticism, and gave "local habitation and a name" to "airy nothing." Let
us be thankful that Shakespeare was not a scholar.

Shakespeare portrayed every form of human character hundreds of years
before there was such a thing as psychoanalysis, and psychologists today
find in him and the puppets of his brain their most prolific examples of
the subtleties of the mind.

Shakespeare did not write about himself, and we have no worldly
knowledge of how such an apparently unlettered man could gain such
command of language and such familiarity with men and nature. Like
Jesus, he knew what was in man. Such discernment comes only with ages of
experience, and we are safe in asserting that Shakespeare was a

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

very old soul and that he inherited from previous lives a culture that
made him a mastermind. We all have an untapped mind of knowledge in our
subconscious mind, and it requires a mastermind to uncover it.
Inspiration and rediscovery are the positive and negative poles of the
mind. Shakespeare's writings indicate that he drew upon both these
sources and concentrated the product in thought of the highest nobility
coupled in the same scenes with shocking vulgarity. Shakespeare wrote
down both what he got from the memories below and from the heavens
above. Many persons whose normal thoughts are pure as snow are often
shocked and puzzled at their incongruous and sometimes lascivious
dreams. A maturer development will reveal that the I AM has taken
advantage of the sleeping conscious mind and renewed associations with
things sealed up in the depths of the subconscious mind.

That Shakespeare was familiar with a world beyond the grasp of the sense
is quite evident from the words he puts into the mouths of his players.
His statements about dreams, visions, witches, and prophecies, and
various other references to the unseen world show that he had faith and
sight above the ordinary dweller in sense.

In the play "Julius Caesar" Calpurnia, wife of Caesar, has a dream
warning her of the impending danger to her husband, and she begs him not
to go to the senate on the fateful day. His friends urge

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

him to go, and he explains his reason for wanting to stay at home.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:  
She dreampt to-night she saw my statue,  
Which like a foundation with an hundred spouts,  
Did run pure blood, and many lusty Romans  
Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it:  
And these does she apply for warnings and portents  
And evils imminent, and on her knee  
Hath begged that I will stay at home to-day.  
</span>

</div>

Decius argues that the dream has been misinterpreted. He says:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">It was a vision fair and fortunate:  
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,  
In which so many smiling Romans bathed,  
Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck  
Reviving blood, and that great men shall press  
For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.  
</span>

</div>

Here Shakespeare reveals an acquaintance with both the literal and the
allegorical meaning of dreams. Modern metaphysicians have discovered by
experience that the interpretation of dreams requires the finest kind of
discrimination. Some dreams are cast in the phenomenal and are given for
enlightenment of the dreamer about outer events, while others are
parables. Calpurnia has the discerning mind, and in the same context
remarks,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">There is one within  
Besides the things that we have heard and seen.  
</span>

</div>

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

The developing soul meets many situations in mind that require superior
wisdom to handle. Helps of a limited character may be had from without,
but the final and only safe guide is the Spirit within. The breadth and
depth of Shakespeare's mind proves that he had in many lives cultivated
the habit of drawing upon the fount of all wisdom within his own soul.

Spiritualists claim that spirit guidance was discovered by the Fox
sisters in Hydesville, New York, less than a century ago, yet we find it
portrayed in a dozen of Shakespeare's plays. Hamlet is infuriated by the
graphic description by his father's ghost of his murder by the king,
Hamlet's uncle. He prefaces the gruesome details with the often quoted
prelude:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I could a tale unfold whose lightest word  
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,  
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,  
Thy knotted and combined locks to part  
And each particular hair to stand on end,  
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.  
</span>

</div>

That Shakespeare has a certain knowledge of the status of those who have
left the body is evidenced by the regrets of the ghost of Hamlet's
father at his untimely violent demise.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatched:  
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,  
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unaneled;  
No reckoning made, but sent to my account  
With all my imperfections on my head.  
</span>

</div>

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

That departed ones continue to live in a realm very near to that in
which we live Shakespeare accepted as a matter of course. He makes them
a vital part of so many scenes that we cannot help concluding that their
existence to him was not open to question. The only place where there is
any doubt suggested is in Act III, Scene 3, of "The Winter's Tale," in
which Antigonus says:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I have heard, but not believed, the spirits o' the
dead  
May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother  
Appeared to me last night, for ne'er was dream  
So like a waking.  
</span>

</div>

Then follows a vivid description of the mother, who "in pure white robes
. . . thrice bowed before me."

Although spiritualism is not accepted by metaphysical Christians in the
terms in which it is presented by its exclusive followers, it is a
question of psychology and must be explained by those who teach Truth.
Shakespeare did not teach religion but the facts of life as he saw them.
The continuous existence of man after death of the body is one of the
facts of man's spiritual life and should be so recognized and its place
defined in psychology. Religion is concerned primarily with spiritual
things, the psychical world is secondary.

Although he may not have applied the law of spiritual healing to himself
he saw the possibility, and in many forceful phrases and subtle
inferences

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

he exalted the inherent power of man. Although Macbeth was cast in the
role of a man of desperate and unsatisfied ambition, Shakespeare put
into his mouth a proclamation any man can make and be strengthened by:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The mind I sway by and the heart I bear  
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.  
</span>

</div>

Shakespeare saw what was coming in true healing; that is, the
restoration of the mind through right thinking. On this point he says:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,  
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,  
Raze out the written troubles of the brain,  
And with some sweet oblivious antidote  
Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff  
Which weighs upon the heart?  
</span>

</div>

Shakespeare was familiar with all the superstitions of his age. His
characters are witches, seers, soothsayers, astrologers; he shows
familiarity with forces that in our day are considered occult and
spooky. They believed in signs and omens, the control of men by the sun,
moon, and stars--astrology. Yet the fallacy of such concepts of
mortality was usually pointed out. In "King Lear" Edmund is made to say:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">This is the excellent foppery of the world, that
when we  
are sick in fortune--often the surfeit of our own  
behavior--we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon  
and the stars: as if we were villains by necessity, fools  
by heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and treachers,  
</span>

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

by spherical predominance; drunkards, liars and adulterers,  
by an enforc'd obedience of planetary influence; and all  
that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on: an admirable  
evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition  
to the change of a star.  

</div>

In "Julius Caesar," where Brutus and Cassius are discussing the
dominance of Caesar, Cassius says:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Ye gods! it doth amaze me  
A man of such feeble temper should  
So get the start of the majestic world  
And bear the palm alone. . . .  
Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world  
Like a Colossus, and we petty men  
Walk under his huge legs and peep about  
To find ourselves dishonorable graves.  
Men at some time are masters of their fates:  
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,  
But in ourselves, that we are underlings.  
</span>

</div>

The oft-discussed metaphysical question of the origin of evil and the
source of good is settled in a concise statement by Hamlet:

"There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so."

Many years ago the London Times announced a contest to test the value
that the English people placed on Shakespeare. The subject voted on was,
in substance, What do you consider of the greatest value to Great
Britain, Shakespeare or the Empire of India? Shakespeare won!

People the world over will readily concur in this estimate of the mind
supreme in Shakespeare.

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

He was "not for a season, but for all time." He excelled as a dramatist,
but as we have shown by these few extracts, he was also a metaphysician,
a prophet, and a poet. The plots of his many plays are largely
adaptations from other authors, but their glorification by Shakespeare's
genius transformed them and may be likened to the glorification of the
natural man by the genius of Jesus. For example, Pythagoras taught that
the universe was harmonized in a masterful symphony, with suns, stars,
and planets as notes on the staff supreme. Shakespeare evidently got
from this his cue for the exquisite lines uttered by Lorenzo:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!  
Here we will sit, and let the sounds of music  
Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night  
Become the touches of sweet harmony.  
Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven  
Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:  
There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st  
But in his motion like an angel sings,  
Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;  
Such harmony is in immortal souls;  
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay  
Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.  
</span>
