###  Chapter VI The Promise of Salvation Genesis 15, 16, 17, and 18 

THE PROMISE of salvation is for everyone. But man must attain it. Man
must be like a child at school. He must study the lessons and pay
attention. Those who are following Jesus find that they have lessons
every day, in mind must listen to inspiration, and like Jesus, must pray
all night when the big problem comes up. If they are faithful to the
Spirit they always gain the victory. The teacher is the Holy Spirit, and
all get their lessons in their own way, some through inspiration, some
through dreams, some through visions, some through flashes of
understanding. Spirit uses the avenue most accessible and open to the
student.

This avenue may change. In fact it often does as man unfolds. The
majority of students get understanding through the quickening of their
own spiritual mind, but as a rule they do not have faith enough to make
it powerful. Here the Spirit comes to the rescue and confirms the new
understanding in dreams, sometimes in visions. As one cultivates a
knowledge of the symbols and a regular word is established the leading
becomes definite. All doubts are erased from consciousness. Thousands of
persons in this age and day have attained a state of mind in which they
commune regularly with Christ.

To be saved according to the standard set up by

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

Jesus we must sit with Him upon His throne in the kingdom of heavens.
This kingdom is to be attained, not after we are dead but while we are
still in the body.

Faith in things spiritual is not born full-orbed and perfect. It has its
stages of growth in man. The parable of the mustard seed is applicable
in this as in many other instances. Up to the time of Abraham man had a
primitive consciousness of Spirit. The story of Abraham shows us how the
consciousness of soul and of the soul's relation to God dawns in the
race mind, beginning a long period of growth that reaches perfection in
the Christ demonstration on the part of Jesus. Therefore Abraham's
history and his varied experiences are to be read as having to do with
the evolution of the soul. The early stages of this soul growth are
symbolized in the experiences of Abraham, the typical man of faith.

The earliest growths of faith are not deeply rooted. We find Abraham at
first living in a tent, which indicates that faith had not yet become an
abiding quality in the consciousness of man. Through certain activities
of the mind faith takes a firmer hold and finally establishes the
"firmament" mentioned in the 1st chapter of Genesis.

Abram and Sarai, as they were called before their names were changed to
Abraham and Sarah, were both old and had no children. Symbolizing faith
and soul, respectively, they were as yet without visible fruit
(manifestation). Deep within his heart Abraham cherished an intense
desire for a son as heir to his own growing faith and the perpetuation
of his own spiritual vision. This desire was later to lead to a test of
his

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

faith in the reality of the unseen and in the power of Spirit to bring
the unseen into visible manifestation.

Not only was Abraham to be himself blessed and given a great name, but
he was to be a blessing to the race in turn. This required something
positive of him; namely the establishment of a faith in the invisible
good as being present and active to the exclusion of a negative faith in
or acceptance of appearances. Thus the promise of God to Abraham was not
alone the promise of a son to gratify his personal desires; it was a
promise that, with a spiritual background to his life, the
impossibilities confronting the natural man would no longer exist and
were to be put out of mind. Abraham was the founder of the faith that
"with God all things are possible."

Abraham's son and the great nation that he was to father were thus first
formed in Abraham's mind by faith in the all-potency of Spirit. The
formation of the Christ, the Son, in the individual follows the same law
and involves the whole man, spirit, soul, and body. The changes that
take place in the mind and in the body of one who begins to exercise the
faculty of faith should occasion no surprise. Sense states of mind have
formed groups of cells and fixed them in consciousness in certain
relations that are not in accord with spiritual law. The activity of
faith in mind and body breaks up these crystallized cells, builds up new
combinations and establishes them in the body in divine order and
harmony. Thus the soul (Sarah) that seems barren of fruit is by faith in
Spirit made to bring forth joyously (Isaac).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 15:1-11. After these things the word of Jehovah
came  
unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear  
</span>

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great  
reward. And Abram said, O Lord Jehovah, what wilt thou give  
me, seeing I go childless, and he that shall be possessor  
of my house is Eliezer of Damascus? And Abram said, Behold,  
to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my  
house is mine heir. And, behold, the word of Jehovah came  
unto him saying, This man shall not be thine heir; but he  
that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be  
thine heir. And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look  
now toward heaven, and number the stars, if thou be able to  
number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.  
And he believed in Jehovah; and he reckoned it to him for  
righteousness. And he said unto him, I am Jehovah that  
brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this  
land to inherit it. And he said, O Lord Jehovah, whereby  
shall I know that I shall inherit it? And he said unto him,  
Take me a heifer three years old, and a she-goat three  
years old, and a ram three years old, and a turtle-dove,  
and a young pigeon. And he took him all these, and divided  
them in the midst, and laid each half over against the  
other: but the birds divided he not. And the birds of prey  
came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.  

</div>

This is a lesson of encouragement to those who are faithful yet see no
visible fruits of their faith. Jehovah said, "Fear not, Abram: I am thy
shield, and thy exceeding great reward." Whoever works under the divine
law is protected, and the result is sure to come. Active faith in the
spiritual powers of Being is productive of tremendous results: "I will
multiply your seed as the stars of heaven." The outward evidence of the
inward reality may be delayed because we are holding in mind some idea
that prevents the manifestation. It is estimated that the best
telescopes reveal

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

as many as two billion stars. This illustrates the generative power of
faith working in the formless substance of spiritual being. Things of
form are limited and can bring but limited reward. Working in the
formless, one is working in the free range of the whole expanse of the
heavens, and the results are like the innumerable stars, beyond all
computation.

The fulfillment of this faith in God may not come at once. A way may be
opened in the consciousness for its descent into externality. But keep
on believing. "He believed in Jehovah; and he reckoned it to him for
righteousness." Then find out why you do not have the visible evidence.
Abram asked for specific evidence. He said, "O Lord Jehovah, whereby
shall I know that I shall inherit it?" Then follow instructions for a
sacrifice. Some ideas on the sense plane must be sacrificed, especially
those that have been holding back the demonstration. A heifer, a
she-goat, a ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon are mentioned. These
represent ideas of physical strength, human will, and subconscious
resistance. The idea of physical strength should be given up for the
realization that its source is spiritual. Sacrifice your human will, and
the divine will will work its perfect way in you. Deny away all
subconscious resistance to the workings of divine law. Let peace and
patience pervade your mind, while ever knowing that swiftness is
characteristic of all spiritual action. Look for a swift fulfillment of
all that you are holding in faith, and if it be delayed, know that some
sacrifices are necessary. In all this process continue to drive away, by
denial, all the "birds of prey," as Abraham did. Faith is quickened and
increased by a denial of all inability, which seems real to the mind of
sense. Affirm

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

that the boundless, limitless power that creates the stars, can
accomplish in your world all that it has promised or that you have
desired.

Abraham's greatest desire was to bring forth a son. Our greatest desire
is like unto it, for it is to bring forth the Son, the Christ, in our
consciousness and in our life. God's promise applies in both cases, and
the method is the same: the limited ideas of sense must be sacrificed
for the limitless power of Spirit.

In a dream God revealed to Abraham that his descendants should be
sojourners in a strange land (Egypt) for four hundred years, and should
then come into Canaan with great substance and power to claim it as
their own country.

God's promises are not vague nor veiled in mystery. If they seem so or
if anything about our religion seems hazy or indefinite to us, it is
because our understanding has not been developed sufficiently to
comprehend the fullness of it. Through his repeated contacts with God
Abraham grew in understanding; in like manner we also grow by
continually "practicing the presence."

Eliezer, steward of the house of Abraham, represents the highest
intellectual concept of the Deity. The name Eliezer means "God is my
help," "God is my success." Eliezer of Damascus points to the will,
which directs the temporal affairs of the illumined ego (Abraham). The
power of the will in the management of one's house or body is so
important that egotism results, and the spiritual man sees that this
must not be perpetuated, so he asks for a "son," a projection of his
exalted ideals; which was fulfilled in Isaac.

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 15:12-21. And when the sun was going down, a
deep  
sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a horror of great darkness  
fell upon him. And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety  
that thy seed shall be sojourners in a land that is not  
theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them  
four hundred years; and also that nation, whom they shall  
serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with  
great substance. But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace;  
thou shalt be buried in a good old age. And in the fourth  
generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity  
of the Amorite is not yet full. And it came to pass, that,  
when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking  
furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these  
pieces. In that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram,  
saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the  
river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:  
the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite, and the  
Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim, and the  
Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the  
Jebusite.  
</span>

</div>

Abraham's vision is fulfilled in the enslavement of the Children of
Israel for four hundred years in Egypt and their final deliverance.

The sun represents the light of Spirit, but we sometimes have periods
when this illumination is obscured ("the sun was going down") and we
become negative in consciousness (Abraham fell into a "deep sleep" or
stupor). Thus we make contact with the subconscious (land of Egypt), in
which region abides substance. The realm of the subconscious needs the
enlightenment of Israel; Israel also needs substance to complete its
manifestation.

The name Kenite means "of or belonging to Kain," "possessions,"
"welding." The Kenites are

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

thought to have been a tribe of the Midianites; therefore like the
latter, they represent the carnal consciousness of man. However they
possess an element not possessed by the Canaanite nations that were to
be utterly destroyed. The thoughts represented by the Kenites of our
text, though seemingly of the carnal or sense man, contain a measure of
judgment, discrimination, and impulse toward good that brings about
their final upliftment into salvation. (One of the meanings of Midian is
"judgment.")

The name Kenizzite means "centralized strength," "possessor," "hunter."
The Kenizzites represent the thoughts of man having to do with the
animal phase of his nature, with animal strength and activity.

The name Kadmonite means "primeval," "prototype," "eternal." The
Kadmonites represent error, carnal thoughts about life.

The name Hittite means "broken in pieces," "sundered," "terror." The
Hittites represent thoughts of opposition, resistance, and fear.

The name Perizzite means "rustic," "dweller in the country." The
Perizzites lived in the hill country of Canaan, like the Canaanites.
These tribes represent thoughts in the subconscious mind that seem to be
at enmity with Spirit, but they are fundamentally part of the principle
and when so recognized can be redeemed and become part of the perfect
man. This is exemplified by the Israelites making friends with the
Kenites.

(For Rephaim see interpretation of Gen. 14. For Amorite, Canaanite,
Girgashite, and Jebusite see interpretation of Gen. 10.)

Euphrates means "fruitfulness." These tribes and nations represent the
fruits of sense consciousness.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 16:1-15. Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bare him no  
children: and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name  
was Hagar. And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, Jehovah  
hath restrained me from bearing; go in, I pray thee, unto  
my handmaid; it may be that I shall obtain children by her.  
And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai. And Sarai,  
Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after  
Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave  
her to Abram her husband to be his wife. And he went in  
unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she  
had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes. And  
Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I gave my  
handmaid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had  
conceived, I was despised in her eyes: Jehovah judge  
between me and thee. But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy  
maid is in thy hand; do to her that which is good in thine  
eyes. And Sarai dealt hardly with her, and she fled from  
her face.  
And the angel of Jehovah found her by a fountain of water  
in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. And  
he said, Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, whence camest thou? and  
whither goest thou? And she said, I am fleeing from the  
face of my mistress Sarai. And the angel of Jehovah said  
unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under  
her hands. And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, I will  
greatly multiply thy seed, that it shall not be numbered  
for multitude. And the angel of Jehovah said unto her,  
Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son; and thou  
shalt call his name Ishmael, because Jehovah hath heard thy  
affliction. And he shall be as a wild ass among men; his  
hand shall be against every man, and every man's hand  
against him; and he shall dwell over against all his  
brethren. And she called the name of Jehovah that spake  
unto her, Thou art a God that seeth: for she said, Have I  
even here looked after him that seeth me? Wherefore  
</span>

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between  
Kadesh and Bered. And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram  
called the name of his son, whom Hagar bare, Ishmael. And  
Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare  
Ishmael to Abram.  

</div>

Abraham and Sarah did not doubt God's promise of a son, but as yet their
faith in the all-creativeness and all-power of God was weak. The
spiritual child (Isaac) is brought forth only through faith.

Abraham took Sarah's maid Hagar and had a son by her. The name Hagar
means "wanderer," "fugitive," "to flee one's country." Metaphysically
Hagar represents the natural or animal soul in man, which is a servant
to the higher, more spiritual soul represented by Sarah. The thoughts of
the animal soul are not lifted up to a very high plane and are therefore
likely to be sensual, selfish, or unholy, which reacts to produce a
state of fear or uncertainty (wanderer). This sensual must give way to
the spiritual. It cannot stand in the presence of the Christ Truth but
flees before it. In development from the lower to the higher there is
often a seeming contention between the spiritual and physical. (Sarah
cast out Hagar.)

Hagar's son, being the fruit of the union of faith with natural will and
affection on a lower plane of expression, was not recognized by Jehovah
as an heir of the promise.

There is an important lesson in this for everyone who is growing in
faith and seeking to bring forth the fruits of Spirit according to the
promise. No true spiritual demonstration is made unless the divine law
is recognized and obeyed. When we try to demonstrate

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

through our own personal will and effort, we find that we fall short.

Paul gives us an interpretation of this allegory in Galatians 4:21-31.
He calls Sarah the freewoman and Hagar the bondmaid. We who are born of
Spirit in the Christ consciousness are sons of the freewoman and the
"children of promise." Those born of the bond-maid (the outer or
material) are of the flesh and are cast out from the inheritance of
Spirit.

Beer-lahai-roi ("the well of the living one who seeth me," "the well of
the vision of life") was the name of "a fountain of water in the
wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur," where the angel met
Hagar when she fled from Sarah. Beer-lahai-roi represents the
recognition by the individual that his life is divine, is spiritual
("the well of the living one that seeth me"), and is for the whole man.
Even the outer or physical man and the human side of the soul are
sustained by the life of God, "the living one." It was beside this well
that the Lord met Hagar and instructed her to return to Sarah, and also
blessed her son Ishmael, who was yet to be born. Ishmael refers to the
outer or flesh consciousness. Isaac (who later lived by this well)
symbolizes divine sonship. When it is understood that there is but one
life and that it is everywhere present in its fullness, the entire man
will be lifted up into eternal life.

Beer-lahai-roi also symbolizes God as the guiding light of both the
inner and the outer man (the well of the vision of life).

The name Bered means "strew," "scatter," "seeding." Bered represents the
sowing of ideas (seed thoughts) in the mind that the individual may
begin

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

to act on them consciously and make them fruitful.

(For Shur and Kadesh see interpretation of Gen. 20:1.)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 17:1-8. And when Abram was ninety years old and
nine,  
Jehovah appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am God  
Almighty; walk before me, and be thou perfect. And I will  
make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply  
thee exceedingly. And Abram fell on his face: and God  
talked with him, saying, As for me, behold, my covenant is  
with thee, and thou shalt be the father of a multitude of  
nations. Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram,  
but thy name shall be Abraham; for the father of a  
multitude of nations have I made thee. And I will make thee  
exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and  
kings shall come out of thee. And I will establish my  
covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee  
throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant,  
to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee. And I  
will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land  
of thy sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an  
everlasting possession; and I will be their God.  
</span>

</div>

"I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be thou perfect."

According to the Scofield Bible, the word Almighty is a translation of
the Hebrew El Shaddai, one of the names applied to God in the Old
Testament. El means the "Strong One," and shad means "the breast,
invariably used in Scripture for a woman's breast. Shaddai therefore
means primarily 'the breasted.' God is 'Shaddai' because He is the
nourisher, the strength-giver, and so, in a secondary sense, the
satisfier, who pours Himself into believing lives."

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

It was revealed to Abram that he should henceforth be called Abraham,
which means "father of a multitude." The change in name always denotes a
change in character so pronounced that the old name will no longer apply
to the new person. We read that Jacob's name was changed to Israel,
Simon's to Peter, and Saul's name was changed to Paul. The change of
name applies to everyone who changes from sense to Spirit, as is
indicated in Revelation 2:17: "I will give him \[that overcometh sense\]
a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which no one
knoweth but he that receiveth it." The new name, Abraham, "father of a
multitude," when we apply it individually means that our faith is to be
expressed by bringing the multitude of our thoughts into the realm of
Spirit and under the guidance of the Christ.

Through Abraham God called His "chosen people." Some have thought that
God's choice of a particular nation or race is out of harmony with the
idea of fatherly love and impartiality toward all His children, and so
have rejected part of God's purpose before they understood it in its
wholeness. Justice to all is seen when the "elect" (select) are
considered in their rightful place in the divine plan of redemption. The
Jews are the seed of Abraham, and through them is the whole human race
blessed by the coming of Jesus.

When Abraham (faith) first catches this large vision of his good,
multiplied "as the stars of the heavens," he is not concerned with
details, which will work themselves out later. The particular channel
through which this great expression would come was not revealed to
Abraham in the first promise. The specific thing, the birth of a son to
Sarah to be called

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

Isaac, was a much later revelation. All the facts in connection with the
call of Abraham, his experiences, and the several promises made to him
by Jehovah God are very important to us, for the great plan of
redemption cannot be understood without them. All these promises have
not been fulfilled even yet, but the word of God stands sure, and there
can be no failure in their fulfillment.

Jehovah on His first contact with Abraham made him a certain promise,
namely that his descendants should become a great nation in which all
the people of the earth would be blessed. This was rather abstract and
indefinite: Abraham was to leave his old life and environment, give up
his home, and go into a new and unknown land (state of consciousness).

Jehovah made His second appearance to Abraham when he was camped under
the oak of Moreh, in the land of Shechem. At that time he was on his way
down to Egypt, keeping the commandment "Get thee out of thy country . .
. unto the land that I will show thee." Here he received Jehovah's
promise "Unto thy seed will I give this land." This shows us that
Abraham is progressing in understanding, that God is becoming more
definite to him, and the promise more specific.

Jehovah next appeared to Abraham after he had separated himself from Lot
and returned to the land of Canaan. This time the promise was still more
definite, namely that Jehovah would give him and his seed forever this
very land that he saw and walked upon, to the eastward, westward,
northward, and southward. Nothing indefinite or theoretical about that!
Yet the promise was still indefinite as regards the descendants, who
were to be as numerous as the dust of the earth.

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

The indefinite nature of this part of the promise was due to Abraham's
lack of understanding and complete faith, for somewhere in his mind was
a doubting thought caused by the fact that his wife Sarah was barren.
When we doubt God's promises by speculating how He can keep them, or
when we set up limitations on His power, we of course fail to
comprehend, and the promises seem vague and indefinite.

Canaan means "lowland"; it symbolizes the body. The redeemed body is the
Promised Land, and when man rediscovers this lost domain all the
promises of the Scriptures will be fulfilled.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 17:9-14. And God said unto Abraham, And as for
thee,  
thou shalt keep my covenant, thou, and thy seed after thee  
throughout their generations. This is my covenant, which ye  
shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee:  
every male among you shall be circumcised. And ye shall be  
circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be  
a token of a covenant betwixt me and you. And he that is  
eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male  
throughout your generations, he that is born in the house,  
or bought with money of any foreigner that is not of thy  
seed. He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought  
with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant  
shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. And the  
uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of  
his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people;  
he hath broken my covenant.  
</span>

</div>

Circumcision is symbolical of the cutting off of mortal tendencies, and
is indicative of purification and cleanliness. One is circumcised in the
true inner significance of the word only by being thoroughly purified

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

in soul. Then, the glory of the inner soul's cleansing and purifying
action works out into the outer consciousness and the body and sets one
free from all sensual, corruptible thoughts and activities.
"Circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter."
Thus man becomes a new creature in Christ Jesus.

Circumcision is the first step toward the eventual elimination of
generation. This was fulfilled in the life of Jesus who taught and
demonstrated regeneration. He spiritualized both soul and body, and thus
made the great demonstration over death. "Verily I say unto you, that ye
who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit
on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones,
judging the twelve tribes of Israel."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 17:15-21. And God said unto Abraham, As for
Sarai thy  
wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall  
her name be. And I will bless her, and moreover I will give  
thee a son of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be  
a mother of nations; kings of peoples shall be of her. Then  
Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his  
heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred  
years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?  
And Abraham said unto God, Oh that Ishmael might live  
before thee! And God said, Nay, but Sarah thy wife shall  
bear thee a son; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I  
will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting  
covenant for his seed after him. And as for Ishmael, I have  
heard thee: behold, I have blessed him, and will make him  
fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes  
shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. But my  
covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear  
unto thee at this set time in the next year.  
</span>

</div>

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

The name Sarai means "bitter," "contentious," "dominative." The name
Sarah means "princess," "noble woman," "noble lady." Sarai's name was
changed to Sarah. In spiritual symbology woman represents the soul or
intuitive part of man. Sarah is the higher phase of the soul. In Sarai
the soul in contending for its rightful place in consciousness; the
individual is just recognizing the fact that his affection and emotions
are in essence divine and must not be united with material conditions
but with Spirit. In Sarah this is more fully realized and expressed.

The name Ishmael means "whom God hears," "whom God understands."
Metaphysically Ishmael represents the fruit of the thoughts of the
natural man at work in the flesh. However, God hears and understands the
outer man of flesh as well as the inner man of Spirit, for he too must
be redeemed from error and corruption. The name Ishmael can also be said
to denote that state of consciousness which recognizes God but which,
because of the seeming opposition of the outer world, does not express
itself according to the highest standards. In other words, Ishmael
represents personality, which has its real source in the I AM but which
goes wrong in its activity.

In its struggle to attain light, understanding, in contacting the outer
or manifest world, it becomes involved in error.

The Lord Jehovah established His everlasting covenant with the promised
heir of Abraham and Sarah, whose name was to be called Isaac.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

in his house, and all that were bought with his money,  
every male among the men of Abraham's house, and  
circumcised the flesh of their foreskins in the selfsame  
day, as God had said unto him. And Abraham was ninety years  
old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his  
foreskin. And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when  
he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. In the  
selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.  
And all the men of his house, those born in the house, and  
those bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised  
with him.  

</div>

When Abraham received the light in regard to circumcision he not only
conformed to the law himself but he ordered all the male members of his
family to follow his example. Metaphysically interpreted, this means
that the central ego (Abraham) catches the light or lays hold of the
dominant idea and transmits it to all states of consciousness in its
domain.

Critics have accused religion of being too general, abstract, and
idealistic. Some have said that the teachings of Jesus are not
"practical" in this age. These critics are invariably looking at
religion from a general and abstract point of view. They consider such
promises as the one made to Abraham that he should be the father of a
great nation, with descendants as many as the stars of heaven,
allegorically rather than the terse and very definite promise "Sarah thy
wife shall bear thee a son."

From a careful study of Genesis, especially the story of Abraham, we
should be able to see that our religion is either a purely speculative
philosophy or a practical principle applicable to daily living,
depending on our point of view and our understanding of it.

<span class="small">Gen. 18:1-5. And Jehovah appeared unto him by the
oaks of  
Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;  
and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men  
stood over against him: and when he saw them, he ran to  
meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the  
earth, and said, My lord, if now I have found favor in thy  
sight, pass not way, I pray thee, from thy servant: let now  
a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest  
yourselves under the tree: and I will fetch a morsel of  
bread, and strengthen ye your heart; after that ye shall  
pass on: forasmuch as ye are come to your servant. And they  
said, So do, as thou hast said.

Here we have a most interesting account of another of Jehovah's
appearances to Abraham. This time Abraham was sitting "in the tent
door," inactive because of "the heat of the day." The tent was pitched
under the oaks of Mamre, and Jehovah's appearance here was the most
definite of all. The oak tree denotes something strong and protective.
In many places in the Bible God's protection is compared to an oak tree.
We are told that God is our strength, our deliverance, our refuge from
the storm. The name Mamre means "fatness," "firmness," "vigor,"
"strength," and Mamre symbolizes endurance, renewed life, and abundant
substance. Thus we see that faith (Abraham) has in and around itself
everything needful for growth and for its firm establishment in
consciousness.

"He lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against
him." Faith must "lift up" its eyes above all material things and look
to the spiritual as the source of all. Having done that, it will
perceive the truth in its triune aspect. Abraham saw Jehovah as "three
men." Jehovah is always the central figure,

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

but we must not lose sight of the fact that, although the one Mind is
the omnipresent source of all, it manifests itself as a trinity of
spirit, soul, and body, or spirit, consciousness, and substance. When
faith lifts up its eyes and catches this vision, then indeed hath
Jehovah appeared unto it, and His promises are sure and clear.

Abraham's bringing water to wash the feet of his guest or guests
symbolizes the necessity of purifying the consciousness by the use of
denials. The "morsel of bread" for the strengthening of the heart
represents substance in its relation to the renewing of one's inner
strength and courage; also the necessity of using affirmation (eating
bread) for the growth of the soul. Abraham recognized the triune aspect
of Jehovah in manifestation, for he talked to the three men as though
they were one man, whom he addresses as "my lord." This "my lord" is the
I AM.

If by faith in Spirit we receive the higher ideas and entertain them as
though they were realities instead of "figments of the imagination," as
the faithless term them, we thereby open the way for a new state of
consciousness. Many Truth seekers try to visualize God by thinking of
the divine master Jesus and surround themselves with pictures of Him to
aid the eye of faith.

Jehovah goes into the details of His former promise to Abraham (faith)
at greater length because through his faith he has now comprehended God
in a more particular and practical way. At the time of the former
promise Jehovah was understood in an abstract and transcendent way, and
His promise was abstract and vast in scope: that Abraham should be the
father of multitudes. Now Abraham (faith) sees God in His

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

triune manifestation as spirit, soul, and body, like unto "three men,"
which is a definite and practical conception. The promise is renewed and
made specific in its terms. Abraham is to be the father of a nation,
because his wife Sarah is to give birth to a son. This is a definite
promise that cannot be misunderstood by Abraham or long postponed by
Jehovah.

Since the human race is made up of individuals all patterned after the
one divine-idea man, we can see in the history of these Bible characters
the story of their own spiritual development both as individuals and as
a race. Our understanding of the life of Abraham will not be complete
unless we consider it in both these relations to us.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 18:6-15. And Abraham hastened into the tent
unto  
Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine  
meal, knead it, and make cakes. And Abraham ran unto the  
herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto  
the servant; and he hasted to dress it. And he took butter,  
and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it  
before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they  
did eat. And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife?  
And he said, Behold, in the tent. And he said, I will  
certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round;  
and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard  
in the tent door, which was behind him. Now Abraham and  
Sarah were old, and well stricken in age; it had ceased to  
be with Sarah after the manner of women. And Sarah laughed  
within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have  
pleasure, my lord being old also? And Jehovah said unto  
Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a  
surety bear a child, who am old? Is anything too hard for  
Jehovah? At the set time I will return unto thee,  
</span>

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

when the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son.  
Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was  
afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.  

</div>

The feast that Abraham set before Jehovah symbolizes the new vital
forces in the bodily organism (tent)--which shares in the spiritual
unfoldment--producing a new state of consciousness (Isaac) in spite of
what seems advanced age or deterioration of bodily vigor. Isaac
represents the pleasure and joyousness of life. The incredulity of
Abraham and Sarah symbolizes the doubts of the natural man.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 18:16-33. And the men rose up from thence, and
looked  
toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on  
the way. And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that  
which I do; seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great  
and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall  
be blessed in him? For I have known him, to the end that he  
may command his children and his household after him, that  
they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and  
justice; to the end that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham  
that which he hath spoken of him. And Jehovah said, Because  
the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their  
sin is very grievous; I will go down now, and see whether  
they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which  
is come unto me; and if not, I will know.  
And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but  
Abraham stood yet before Jehovah. And Abraham drew near,  
and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked?  
Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city:  
wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty  
righteous that are therein? That be far from thee to do  
after this manner, to slay the righteous with the  
</span>

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that  
be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do  
right? And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous  
within the city, then I will spare all the place for their  
sake. And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have  
taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and  
ashes: peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty  
righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five?  
And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty  
and five. And he spake unto him yet again, and said,  
Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said,  
I will not do it for the forty's sake. And he said, Oh let  
not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: peradventure there  
shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it,  
if I find thirty there. And he said, Behold now, I have  
taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: peradventure there  
shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not  
destroy it for the twenty's sake. And he said, Oh let not  
the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once:  
peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will  
not destroy it for the ten's sake. And Jehovah went his  
way, as soon as he had left off communing with Abraham: and  
Abraham returned unto his place.  

</div>

The time has now arrived in the development of spiritual consciousness
when faith (Abraham) must be fully awakened to the truth that all belief
in the expression of sensuality must be entirely put away. Sodom is to
be destroyed. But the man of faith is not yet entirely out of his sense
consciousness. Sodom ("hidden wiles") represents an obscure or concealed
thought habit. Gomorrah ("material force") represents a state of mind
adverse to the law of Spirit. These wicked cities of the plain are
located within man, and before he can come into a realization of the
promised "son"

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

that he desires so much he must consent to a thorough purification from
the sins that go on in them. The purification is by fire and must be
absolutely complete.

The remainder of the chapter concerns Jehovah's revelation to Abraham of
His intention utterly to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah because of their
great wickedness; also Jehovah's agreement to save Sodom if only ten
righteous men could be found in it. The tendency to plead to be allowed
to keep old habits of thought on the ground that there is some good in
them is a characteristic of man's early stages of development. We try
very hard to save some of our secret habits and sense thoughts. At first
we reason that there must be quite a few good things in the old
thoughts, ideas, and ways. Then we are a little less sure about there
being "fifty" and we come down to "ten." But there are not even ten
righteous, and the old consciousness must be destroyed. Error must be
wholly wiped out of the consciousness, and the sooner we consent to
accept the fullness of the regenerative law the sooner we shall enter
the kingdom.

Sodom represents the very lowest form of sense desire in the procreative
center. Today we derive from the word Sodom the name of an unmentionable
vice. Yet the spiritual-minded Abraham persisted in the belief that
there must be some good in Sodom. Jehovah showed him otherwise. The
tendency to plead that there must be good in sense habits persists very
strongly. We cannot conceive why these functions, which seem so
necessary to the reproduction of the race, should not be under the
divine law. We have not yet awakened to the fact that they are but an
external and counterfeit expression, a degenerate imitation, of divine
reproduction.

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

Do not hold the thought that your so-called natural functions are
divine. They are great mysteries to the human consciousness, to be
understood when we have acquired spiritual wisdom. The race has gone
through some strange experiences, and wonderful revelations come to
those who get beneath the surface of things. There are those walking the
earth today who could startle the world with revelations of Truth about
the things right under our eyes that we do not see. Resolutely turn your
back on all the forms of sense thought and seek no excuse for them. Then
you will gradually begin to see the light within the light.

All these incidents, men, and places represent states of consciousness
in the individual. The men represent the human desires that are still
attached to the senses (Sodom and Gomorrah); the incidents denote their
method of operation, and the places indicate their sphere of activity.
