###  Chapter XIII The Blessing of the Faculties Genesis 47, 48, 49, and 50 

JOSEPH IS A SUBLIME IDEA of Truth that goes down into the darkened sense
consciousness, and under the law finally raises it up and out of sense
and into Spirit. He was seemingly forced there by his brothers, yet he
was sent by the Lord to prepare for the maintenance of Jacob's family
through the period of dearth that later came to Canaan. The Truth he
represents, when taken down into the sense consciousness, establishes
there a new realization of life that will result in the regeneration of
the entire man. We must often go consciously into every part of our body
and build it up in Truth with new ideas of life and substance.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 47:1-12. Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh,
and  
said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and  
their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the  
land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of  
Goshen. And from among his brethren he took five men, and  
presented them unto Pharaoh. And Pharaoh said unto his  
brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto  
Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our  
fathers. And they said unto Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land  
are we come; for there is no pasture for thy servants'  
flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now  
therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land  
of Goshen. And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy  
father and thy brethren are come  
</span>

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

unto thee: the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of  
the land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell; in the  
land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any able  
men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle. And  
Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before  
Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. And Pharaoh said unto  
Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy life? And  
Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my  
pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years: few and evil  
have been the days of the years of my life, and they have  
not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my  
fathers in the days of their pilgrimage. And Jacob blessed  
Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh. And  
Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a  
possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land,  
in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. And  
Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his  
father's household, with bread, according to their families.  

</div>

Joseph's brothers had been shepherds in Canaan. It is the business of
our mind faculties (Jacob's sons) to tend those thought aggregations
(flocks, herds) that pertain to our vitality. There were no sheep in
Egypt, but Pharaoh made them "rulers" over his cattle. Cattle represent
physical strength, which like all the powers of man on the natural
plane, must be spiritualized. The faculties, having come down into a
more material state of consciousness (Egypt), take dominion over and
lift up the animal thoughts and tendencies in the body and unify them
with Spirit. This is done by a transmutation of quality and is attained
by right thinking, by putting the "cattle" under the control of the
thoughts of reality or Spirit, represented by the Israelites.

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

Joseph brought his father to the ruler, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. This
shows that the power that rules the body, under the material regime,
rules in obscurity or is without spiritual understanding. When
imagination (Joseph) brings the higher understanding (Jacob) to the body
consciousness (Pharaoh), the higher blesses the lower.

Thus, the father and the brothers of Joseph took up their abode in the
land of Egypt, and Joseph nourished them there. The imagination, which
is our faculty of increase, when established in Truth, prepares the way
for us. It inspires, encourages, and sustains the other faculties in us
when they fall into a seemingly material phase of being, and ultimately
brings about the spiritualization of the whole organism, mind, soul, and
body.

It is thought that Rameses is the same name as Raamses, which means "son
of Ra," "son of the sun," "sun's emanation." Rameses represents a
consciousness of substance in the domain of the physical ego (Pharaoh).
This "sun" or "light" consciousness, which in Pharaoh and Egypt is
obscured or veiled by the life on the lower sense plane, works in
conjunction with the higher religious thoughts (Hebrews) that are in
servitude to the darkened sense consciousness symbolized by Egypt, and
so this reserve substance (Rameses) is built up in Egypt.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 47:13-26. And there was no bread in all the
land; for  
the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and the  
land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. And Joseph  
gathered up all the money that was found in the land of  
Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they  
</span>

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.  
And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and  
in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph,  
and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy  
presence? for our money faileth. And Joseph said, Give your  
cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.  
And they brought their cattle unto Joseph; and Joseph gave  
them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks,  
and for the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with  
bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year. And  
when that year was ended, they came unto him the second  
year, and said unto him, We will not hide from my lord, how  
that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my  
lord's; there is nought left in the sight of my lord, but  
our bodies, and our lands: wherefore should we die before  
thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for  
bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh:  
and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that  
the land be not desolate.  
So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the  
Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine was  
sore upon them: and the land became Pharaoh's. And as for  
the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of  
the border of Egypt even to the other end thereof. Only the  
land of the priests bought he not: for the priests had a  
portion from Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which  
Pharaoh gave them; wherefore they sold not their land. Then  
Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this  
day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you,  
and ye shall sow the land. And it shall come to pass at the  
ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth unto Pharaoh, and  
four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and  
for your food, and for them of your households, and for  
food for your little ones. And they said, Thou  

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

hast saved our lives: let us find favor in the sight of my  
lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants. And Joseph made it  
a statute concerning the land of Egypt unto this day, that  
Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests  
alone became not Pharaoh's.  

</div>

In the early stages of regeneration there are times when the developing
soul has exhausted its resources and the outer world no longer
satisfies. When it reaches this point man has to turn within and
appropriate from the higher principles that which they have to give. The
center of the great solar plexus (Pharaoh) is also the conservator of
substance and life in the organism. When man is spiritually famished and
feels the lack he is eager regardless of cost to go to the inner
reservoirs of stored-up substance for sustenance. First he gives up to
the higher principles the power and strength of the natural man
(symbolized by money and cattle), then he draws on the fixed forces, the
land (representing the body), until it is finally realized that the
higher principles really are in authority. In the last analysis the
"sun" (solar plexus) consciousness is actually the great distributor.
The men (thought forces) were given seed to sow the land, and Pharaoh
(the great distributing ego) permitted them to have four fifths of the
harvest for sustenance, while retaining one fifth (in the subconscious)
to meet any usual demands. The man now becomes aware of the presence of
this subconscious ego that, when spiritually instructed by the
imagination (Joseph), will handle all the processes of rebuilding the
body. Finally this becomes an established law. The priests, representing
the higher spiritual life, are not subject to this law.

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 47:27-31. And Israel dwelt in the land of
Egypt, in  
the land of Goshen; and they gat them possessions therein,  
and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly. And Jacob  
lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the days of  
Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty and  
seven years. And the time drew near that Israel must die:  
and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I  
have found favor in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand  
under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: bury me  
not, I pray thee, in Egypt; but when I sleep with my  
fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in  
their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast  
said. And he said, Swear unto me: and he sware unto him.  
And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.  
</span>

</div>

The central thought in this Scripture is that Jacob is giving up old
ideas and taking on new. The life of Jacob in a certain unfoldment was
drawing to a close, and his desire was that his body be buried with his
fathers in the cave of Machpelah. This indicates that a certain phase of
the illumined intellect is sinking back into the subconsciousness
(Macpelah). All experiences in life that have spiritual qualities and
all realities gained in the land of unity (Goshen) are preserved in the
subconsciousness. Joseph's placing his hand under the thigh of Jacob
symbolizes the truth that the illumined intellect needs the
encouragement and support and power of the imagination in order to
effect spiritually the change that is about to take place. When this is
granted, Jacob bows down in gratitude and thanksgiving to the Holy One
and rests in the realization that all is well. "And Israel bowed himself
upon the bed's head."

Jacob's age is significant. The number seven symbolizes

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

fullness in the world of phenomena. It is so universally used as a
mystical number that its basis must be in some fundamental arrangement
of the natural world.

(For significance of the oath see interpretation of Gen. 24:9.)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 48:1-4. And it came to pass after these things,
that  
one said to Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took  
with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. And one told  
Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee:  
and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed. And  
Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at  
Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, and said unto  
me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee,  
and I will make of thee a company of peoples, and will give  
this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting  
possession.  
</span>

</div>

In this Scripture the I AM functioning in the illumined intellect
(Jacob) is taking cognizance of its abilities and possessions before it
sinks back into the subconsciousness for a season of rest. The I AM
faculty of imagination (Joseph) is quick to discern what is taking place
and brings the will and the understanding, the yes and the no of the
mind (Ephraim and Manasseh), to the I AM for a final blessing. (The will
and the understanding are the powers that say yes and no to your
thoughts.)

The Lord had blessed Jacob (the I AM) at Luz. One interpretation of Luz
is "separation," but under the light of Spirit we find that that which
we conceive to be apart from God (Luz) is in truth His abode (Bethel,
house of God). Therefore this Luz state of consciousness belongs
eternally to the I AM and its

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

faculties will (Ephraim) and understanding (Manasseh), which faculties
are to multiply and bring forth fruit exceedingly.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 48:5, 6. And now thy two sons, who were born
unto thee  
in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt,  
are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon,  
shall be mine. And thy issue, that thou begettest after  
them, shall be thine; they shall be called after the name  
of their brethren in their inheritance.  
</span>

</div>

The I AM (Jacob) here claims Joseph's two sons Ephraim and Manasseh
(fruit of the imagination) as his own. The primal faculties of will
(Ephraim) and understanding (Manasseh) or of affirmation and denial now
come under the dominion of the I AM, symbolized by Jacob. The secondary
issues come under the imagination (Joseph).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 48:7. And as for me, when I came from Paddan,
Rachel  
died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was  
still some distance to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her  
there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Bethlehem).  
</span>

</div>

When an important ego is about to change its plane of expression, a
memory of past experiences, especially of those which are dear to the
heart, flashes into the mind. Spiritually that which is good in the
experiences is retained and that which is not good is cast aside. In
soul consciousness the soul intuitively rejects the error and claims the
good. It is an occasion where denial and affirmation play an important
part.

Jacob had been on his way from Paddan (a place of substance in the
consciousness and body organism of the individual) and was yet some
distance from Ephrath

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

(realization of abundance); that is, the illumined I AM (Jacob) had been
passing from a lower plane of substance to a higher plane. During this
period of transition the consciousness of love for material substance
(Rachel) died, or sank back into the subconscious, there to become the
foundation of a more spiritual love. Now through introspection Jacob was
eliminating the error and affirming the good.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 48:8-22. And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and
said,  
Who are these? And Joseph said unto his father, They are my  
sons, whom God hath given me here. And he said, Bring them,  
I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them. Now the eyes  
of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And  
he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and  
embraced them. And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not  
thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath let me see thy  
seed also. And Joseph brought them out from between his  
knees; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. And  
Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward  
Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward  
Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him. And  
Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon  
Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon  
Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh  
was the first-born. And he blessed Joseph, and said, The  
God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the  
God who hath fed me all my life long unto this day, the  
angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads;  
and let my name be named on them, and the name of my  
fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a  
multitude in the midst of the earth. And when Joseph saw  
that his father laid his right hand upon the head of  
Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's  
hand, to remove it from  
</span>

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head. And Joseph said unto  
his father, Not so, my father; for this is the first-born;  
put thy right hand upon his head. And his father refused,  
and said, I know it, my son, I know it; he also shall  
become a people, and he also shall be great; howbeit his  
younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed  
shall become a multitude of nations. And he blessed them  
that day, saying, In thee will Israel bless, saying, God  
make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim  
before Manasseh. And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I  
die: but God will be with you, and bring you again unto the  
land of your fathers. Moreover I have given to thee one  
portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of  
the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.  

</div>

When Joseph came to visit his father in the land of Goshen, he brought
his two sons with him. Hearing that they were coming, "Israel
strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed." Thus understanding
(Manasseh) and will (Ephraim) bring strength when weakness appears. Job
says, "When they cast thee down, thou shalt say, There is lifting up."

Jacob blessed his grandsons, and his blessing is significant. Manasseh,
being the first-born (under divine law understanding precedes will),
would be entitled to the chief blessing, but Jacob laid his right hand
upon the head of Ephraim and his left hand upon the head of Manasseh
instead of the reverse, which was the customary way of blessing. Joseph,
thinking his aged father's dim eyesight responsible for this seeming
error, called his attention to it. Jacob replied that he knew what he
was doing and that although the older son was to become great and
important, Ephraim (will) would take precedence under the natural law to
which

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

they were both to be subjected.

That certain laws in race evolution are involved in the blessing by
Jacob of Joseph's two sons, also that a special spiritual dispensation
to the Hebrews, to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, was instituted
must be admitted by those who believe that this Scripture is inspired.
But this dependence on the Lord for guidance could not go on forever;
the highest test of character is the self-made man. Man must develop
from within, and the time comes to every soul when it must glow with its
own inner light, regardless of the mistakes it may make.

Jacob saw that the time had come for Ephraim and Manasseh to act on
their own initiative, and he knew what he was doing when he gave Ephraim
(the will) first place. In the free, full development of man the will
and ambition to achieve leap ahead of the understanding. This has been
and still is the experience of the human race, and it will continue to
be until man in his freedom willingly accepts divine guidance. Then
Manasseh (the understanding) will come into his own and assume first
place in consciousness. The blunders of man will then be corrected and a
mutual understanding be restored to the whole world.

Up to this time the faculties symbolized by Ephraim and Manasseh had
been under the inspiration of the imagination (Joseph). Joseph's taking
his sons from between his knees and handing them over to Jacob for the
final blessing symbolizes the restoration of the faculties to their
natural estate. The dying of Jacob represents the withdrawal of the
activity of this special spiritual inspiration imparted through the I
AM.

The final blessing of the I AM on the imagination

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

(Joseph) promised that it would be taken back or "reincarnated" in the
land of the fathers. The one extra portion that Jacob gave to Joseph,
which he "took out of the hand of the Amorite" (a race inheritance) with
his sword (power of the word) and bow (directive power), is an amorous
force that finds expression on the generative plane but which eventually
must be elevated to spiritual consciousness. The exercise of any faculty
to the best of one's ability is appreciated by the Lord (law), and we
get an extra portion, a "free gift of God." We receive a certain return
for our mental effort although we may not always directly recognize God
as the source.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 49:1, 2. And Jacob called unto his sons, and
said:  
Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which  
shall befall you in the latter days.  
Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob;  
And hearken unto Israel your father.  
</span>

</div>

A blessing signifies the imparting of spiritual good, which the
recipient may receive or reject according to his mental attitude. The
blessing by Jacob of his twelve sons symbolizes the sowing of seed in
consciousness for a future harvest. Through the power of his word Jacob
was raising the consciousness of his primal ideas. In effect he was
proclaiming: "You represent the A B C of man's life, and I am revealing
to you in symbols the foundation you have laid, what you will have to
contend with in the future, and what you can attain. You stand for the
foundation faculties that constitute the coming ideal man. The true seed
idea of this ideal man is implanted within each of you and will
eventually become manifest. This process of manifestation covers your
history up to the time of the appearance of the

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

man that God imaged in the beginning, even Jesus Christ."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 49:3, 4.  
Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the  
beginning of my strength;  
The pre-eminence of dignity, and the pre-eminence  
of power.  
Boiling over as water, thou shalt not have the pre-eminence;  
Because thou wentest up to thy father's bed;  
Then defilest thou it; he went up to my couch.  
</span>

</div>

Reuben, the first-born, symbolizes the faith of man in his ability as
expressed through his animal nature. Here we see the vigor and vitality
of the functioning of man's elemental life, which boils over "as water,"
loses command. Reuben is represented as the natural man giving way to
his passions and appetites before he has developed spiritual mastery.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 49:5, 7.  
Simeon and Levi are brethren;  
Weapons of violence are their swords.  
O my soul, come not thou into their council;  
Unto their assembly, my glory, be not thou united;  
For in their anger they slew a man,  
And in their self-will they hocked an ox.  
Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce;  
And their wrath, for it was cruel:  
I will divide them in Jacob,  
And scatter them in Israel.  
</span>

</div>

Simeon represents receptivity (feeling) and Levi love (sensation). The
faculties of feeling and sensation in human consciousness have been
debased on the mortal plane. Simeon, the obedient one, one who is easily
influenced, falls under the sway of physical sensation.

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

In Simeon and Levi we also have an exhibition of animal love and of its
vengefulness as exemplified in their treacherous attempt to right the
wrong committed against their sister Dinah.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 49:8-12.  
Judah, thee shall thy brethren praise:  
Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies;  
Thy father's sons shall bow down before thee.  
Judah is a lion's whelp;  
From the prey, my son, thou art gone up:  
He stooped down, he couched as a lion,  
And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?  
The sceptre shall not depart from Judah,  
Until Shiloh come;  
And unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be.  
Binding his foal unto the vine,  
And his ass's colt unto the choice vine;  
He hath washed his garments in wine,  
And his vesture in the blood of the grapes:  
His eyes shall be red with wine,  
And his teeth white with milk.  
</span>

</div>

Jacob's blessing on Judah was the most significant. Judah was to conquer
all his enemies:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The sceptre shall not depart from Judah,  
Nor the ruler's staff from between his feet,  
Until Shiloh come;  
And unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be.  
</span>

</div>

Shiloh signifies peace of mind, wholeness, completion or fullness, and
represents the Prince of Peace, the Messiah or Savior. Jesus was a
direct descendant of Judah, as is shown in the 1st chapter of Matthew.
The name Judah applies to only one of the twelve tribes, but is often
used to designate the Jewish nation as a whole. This would indicate that
praise is

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

such an active principle in spiritual thought that it is deserving of
first place. The power of the word of praise shall be felt until the
coming of the Prince of Peace.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 49:13.  
Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea;  
And he shall be for a haven of ships;  
And his border shall be upon Sidon.  
</span>

</div>

Zebulun represents the law that relates man to the universal cosmos. He
dwells under the law of protection and safety (refuge), yet has a
realization of the universal Mind (sea). Zebulun is that in us which is
concerned with the maintenance of our individual importance regardless
of the immensity of the universal. Those who are in personality will
find refuge in this state of consciousness. We lose consciousness of our
spiritual importance by looking out into the universe but can retain our
identity as children of God through realizing that Spirit is
individualized in us.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 49:14, 15.  
Issachar is a strong ass,  
Couching down between the sheepfolds:  
And he saw a resting-place that it was good,  
And the land that it was pleasant;  
And he bowed his shoulder to bear,  
And became a servant under taskwork.  
</span>

</div>

Issachar symbolizes the inner latent powers in man. He represents that
side of the natural man which accepts conditions as they appear to be
and bears the burdens of life without question, as exemplified by the
patient ass.

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 49:16-18.  
Dan shall judge his people,  
As one of the tribes of Israel.  
Dan shall be a serpent in the way,  
An adder in the path,  
That biteth the horse's heels,  
So that his rider falleth backward.  
I have waited for thy salvation, O Jehovah.  
</span>

</div>

Dan represents discrimination or judgment, a choosing between good and
evil. The serpent is used as a symbol of subtlety. "Now the serpent was
more subtle than any beast of the field." Jesus advised His followers to
be "wise as serpents, and harmless as doves." Sensation rushes through
the organism like a race horse, but judgment "bites at the heels" to
restrain the headlong flight.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 49:19.  
Gad, a troop shall press upon him;  
But he shall press upon their heel.  
</span>

</div>

Gad represents latent spiritual power, which like an army is always
ready to do a mighty work. Science tells of an omnipresent ether that
presses upon us in the invisible from every direction. One scientist
says that the atomic energy in a pea would propel a large seagoing
vessel from America to England and return. This ether has its analogy in
Spirit, which continually inspires us when we give it our attention. Our
mind is in direct contact with this spiritual power, and our word puts
it into action.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 49:20.  
Out of Asher his bread shall be fat,  
And he shall yield royal dainties.  
</span>

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

Asher represents the understanding mind and its ability to  
manipulate universal substance (bread) and make it manifest  
richly. The bread or divine substance is susceptible of  
infinite adaptation. Those who think about it as limited in  
its expression manifest limited supply, while those who

Naphtali is a hind let loose:

</span>

</div>

The Hebrew meaning of the name Naphtali is "my wrestling," "wrestling of
Jehovah." Naphtali represents the activity of strength in man's
consciousness. Jacob's blessing on Naphtali was that he might have the
strength and speed of the deer and the power of the word to increase
strength.

<span class="small">Gen. 49:22-26.  
Joseph is a fruitful bough,  
A fruitful bough by a fountain;  
His branches run over the wall.  
The archers have sorely grieved him,  
And shot at him, and persecuted him:  
But his bow abode in strength,  
And the arms of his hands were made strong,  
By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob  
(From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel),  
Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee,  
And by the Almighty, who shall bless thee,  
With blessings of heaven above,  
Blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath,  
Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.  
The blessings of thy father  
Have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors

Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills:  
They shall be on the head of Joseph,  
And on the crown of the head of him that was separated from  
his brethren.  

</div>

Joseph, representing the imagination, is at all times very close to
divine inspiration. If man would curb his will and keep it in abeyance
he would not "imagine vain things." Notwithstanding the destructive
power of the personal will ("archers") with which he is associated his
directive power is victorious. Joseph's persecution and sale into Egypt
by his willful brothers and his demonstration of superiority to his fate
illustrate the victory of an inspired imagination. The whole story of
Joseph is an example of the successful functioning of man's imaging
faculty when he keeps contact with Jehovah.

Benjamin is a wolf that raveneth:

All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it  
that their father spake unto them and blessed them; every

</span>

</div>

Benjamin (faith) in his hunger after righteousness is compared to a
famished wolf. In the morning or beginning he appropriates understanding
to the full, which he divides or imparts freely at the evening or end of
the period.

and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah--the field

In the Scripture allegories the various individuals represent the
different phases of character through which one man passes in his
spiritual unfoldment. As these follow in a series, gradually reaching
greater heights, the old phases of character are left behind to be
replaced by new ones. Thus the Biblical characters are said to "die" and
to be "gathered unto their fathers." Tennyson was inspired to express a
great truth, as poets often are, when he wrote,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Men may rise on steppingstones  
Of their dead selves to higher things."  
</span>

</div>

So each of the great Bible personalities is gradually replaced in the
mind of him who is in the narrow way. When a great change takes place,
some old phase of consciousness has lost its hold, and we read that
Jacob or Joseph or another character "dies." This does not mean that
there has been any loss or that anything has "gone away" but that
certain states of mind have fulfilled their regenerative work and have
been succeeded by others.

(For Ephron, Machpelah, and Mamre see interpretation of Gen. 23:3-20.)

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his  
father: and the physicians embalmed Israel. And forty days  
were fulfilled for him, for so are fulfilled the days of  
embalming: and the Egyptians wept for him threescore and  
ten days.  
And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph  
spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have  
found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of  
Pharaoh, saying, My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I  
die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of  
Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go  
up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.  
And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as  
he made thee swear. And Joseph went up to bury his father;  
and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the  
elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of  
Egypt, and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and  
his father's house: only their little ones, and their  
flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.  
And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and  
it was a very great company. And they came to the  
threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and  
there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation:  
and he made a mourning for his father seven days. And when  
the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the  
mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a  
grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of  
it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan. And  
his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: for  
his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried  
him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham  
bought with the field, for a possession of a burying place,  
of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.  

</div>

Whenever the I AM withdraws, no matter in what state of consciousness it
has been functioning, there is a

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

great shock to the soul, and all the forces of the natural man are
filled with grief and consternation. "And he made a mourning for his
father seven days." The imagination (Joseph), favorite faculty (son) of
the illumined intellect (Jacob), mourned greatly, not fully
understanding that the withdrawal of the I AM eventually would culminate
in good.

The name Atad means "bramble," "thornbush," "a thorn." It was on the
threshing floor of Atad that Joseph and his brethren mourned seven days
for their father Jacob. A threshing floor may be thought of as a place
of judgment or separation, of letting go of that which is no longer
needful to be expressed in consciousness. Atad represents the belief
that vexations, trials, and sorrows are real. It is this unredeemed
thought or belief in man that causes him to experience deep grief and
tribulation at giving up his personal hold on old ideas and objects
which are due to be released from his mind and affairs. This unredeemed
belief is concerned with and dwells on the trial side of the process
rather than on the blessing side of it.

The Canaanites symbolize the semispiritual in man. They changed the name
(or character) of Atad. "And when the inhabitants of the land, the
Canaanites, saw the mourning on the floor of Atad, they said, This is a
grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called
Abel-mizraim." The Egyptians symbolize materiality.

Abel-mizraim ("mourning of Egypt or Egyptians," "mourning or meadow of
distress") represents the feeling of sorrow and loss in the sense man
that often accompanies the letting go of some good idea in consciousness
after it has finished its work. Man's tendency

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

is to cling to the old ideas that have been helpful to him. But when
their work is done in the individual for the time being, these old
ideas, no matter how well they have served, must be released from
consciousness so that other and higher ideas may take their place. This
is a process of judgment, a sifting of ideas and thoughts, a letting go
of the chaff and a laying hold of the wheat (on the threshing floor).

The Jordan represents a stream of thought, good, bad, and indifferent,
flowing through the subconscious.

Machpelah refers to the subconscious body substance.

Ephron the Hittite symbolizes a phase of thought that is quick to change
its thinking base. The word Hittite denotes thoughts belonging to the
carnal consciousness of man.

Mamre suggests strength, vigor; it also represents the seat of the
conscious mind.

(For further discussion of these names see interpretation of Gen.
23:3-20.)

This closing chapter of Genesis is an allegorical account of the end of
the work of Jacob and his family in Egypt. The descent of Joseph (the
illumined imagination) into Egypt paved the way for Jacob (the
spiritually illumined ego) and his kin to make contact with subconscious
substance. These pioneers of Jehovah accomplished their work, and their
leader Jacob "died" or withdrew from consciousness. That the whole man,
including the physical, was helped by Jacob is evidenced by the interest
the Egyptians took in the funeral of Jacob and the great company that
went up to Canaan with the Children of Israel.

<span class="small">Gen. 50:14-21. And Joseph returned into Egypt,  
</span>

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury  
his father, after he had buried his father.  
And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead,  
they said, It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will  
fully requite us all the evil which we did unto him. And  
they sent a message unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did  
command before he died, saying, So shall ye say unto  
Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the transgression of thy  
brethren, and their sin, for that they did unto thee evil.  
And now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression of the  
servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when  
they spake unto him. And his brethren also went and fell  
down before his face; and they said, Behold, we are thy  
servants. And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in  
the place of God? And as for you, ye meant evil against me;  
but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this  
day, to save much people alive. Now therefore fear ye not:  
I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted  
them, and spake kindly unto them.  

</div>

The imagination returning to the body consciousness (Egypt) again takes
up the work of redeeming it.

The confession of the brothers of Joseph to their crime against him and
his loving forgiveness both point to the spiritual uplift that has taken
place in soul evolution.

"Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones"
signifies that the imagination in its divine purity and holiness is one
of the sources of good to the whole man. What you mold in your mind
under the spiritual law is formed in your affairs and thus is the source
of prosperity.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 50:22-26. And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and
his  
father's house: and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.  
And Joseph saw Ephraim's children  
</span>

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

of the third generation: the children also of Machir the  
son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph's knees. And Joseph  
said unto his brethren, I die; but God will surely visit  
you, and bring you up out of this land unto the land which  
he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. And Joseph  
took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will  
surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from  
hence. And Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old:  
and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.  

</div>

Joseph also died in Egypt but not until he had lived among the children
of Ephraim unto "the third generation." This means that the Joseph
qualities of mind are developing a deeper understanding of spiritual
things. Machir, the name of a son of Manasseh (understanding), means
"acquired," "purchased." The children of Machir that were "born upon
Joseph's knees" represent the balance and poise that must actively exist
in us if we are abidingly to possess true understanding. The Joseph
characteristics gradually become a part of the whole body consciousness.

The insistence by all these patriarchs that their bones be taken to
Canaan for burial is emblematic of the truth that the substance of them
and what they represent is to be restored to its source, Spirit.
Although Joseph died and was embalmed and put in a coffin in Egypt, his
bones were finally brought to Canaan, as stated in the last chapter of
the Book of Joshua.
