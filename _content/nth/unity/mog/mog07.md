###  Chapter V The Initial Step toward Redemption Genesis 12, 13, and 14 

ACCORDING to Jesus, when a man turns toward a new country, a new state
of consciousness, he must quicken his faith. Formerly he has had faith
in material processes; he has attached himself to material things. Thus
Abraham long lived in the sense world or consciousness, represented by
Sodom and Gomorrah. His higher ideal, Jehovah, urged him to flee from
that world and not to move back but to detach his mind from the things
of sense and turn his face toward the light. This new land that the Lord
desired him to go to represents new ideas and their manifestation, a new
relationship to the substance of things. When the new ideas begin to
multiply in man's mind, his environment changes; as Paul says, "if any
man is in Christ, he is a new creature." But the beginning is to believe
further than you can see or feel in terms of the senses. A man often
finds it necessary to go into a "new country" that he knows nothing
about; and he has to trust the Lord to carry him through. "Blessed are
they that have not seen, and yet have believed." To put faith in things
spiritual is the essential step.

The call of Abraham is considered the initial step in a great plan for
the redemption of the Adam race from its material, sensual
consciousness, called the fall of man. From any mortal viewpoint the
time seems

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

long and the way tortuous, but we may, if we will, enter into the mind
of the Spirit, where one day is as a thousand years and a thousand years
are as one day, and here we see the whole plan worked out in a definite,
systematic, and orderly way.

Every detail in Abraham's experience has a definite counterpart in the
life of each one who is bringing forth the Christ in man. A study of
these things is therefore of great importance to all who seek the
realization of sonship. To them it is given to understand "the mystery
which hath been hid for ages and generations."

Abraham represents faith, the first great faculty developed or "called
out" by man in the unfoldment of his spiritual nature or Christ Mind.
Faith is that faculty by which we know God as omnipresent Spirit
substance. This substance is man's supply, as discerned by the author of
Hebrews when he said, "Faith is the substance of things hoped for." By
faith we appropriate the spiritual substance of whatever things we
desire, thus taking the first step necessary to their manifestation.
Abraham, rich in faith, increased his substance until it was very great.

Volumes might be written about faith in its relation to the conscious,
subconscious, and superconscious departments of mind; or about its
centers of action in the body. Abraham represents faith in its early
establishment in consciousness, and his life portrays the different
movements of this faculty on the various planes of action in man's
being. In order to understand the lessons that Abraham's life has for
us, a certain familiarity with each plane of consciousness is necessary.

That in the individual which is called "I" may be

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

termed attention. It is in reality the spiritual man. It is the inherent
capacity of the "I" to recognize ideas and through the law of Being to
form ideas into states of consciousness. By forming these new states and
setting up action in their various departments, the "I" (attention) can
then leave them, as the millwright leaves the mill he has constructed
over a waterfall. Nature carries on the work once it is established.

So we find ourselves in possession of states of consciousness that may
seem to be ignorant. There are, for instance, the subconscious states
that have to do with the processes of digestion, assimilation,
circulation, respiration, elimination, and the like. We could not be in
possession of an organism having these various powers of mind unless at
some point in our experience we had established them. If we consciously
assumed these powers ourselves, it is plainly possible that we could
again go back of them and become familiar with their subconscious
action.

Thus it is a question of attention whether or not we shall know about
these various planes of mental activity. If we fix our thoughts for but
ten minutes a day on the heart, we shall know in a short time what is
going on at that center. So with every department of the organism.
Whatever the process being carried on by an organ in the body, we may be
assured that a center of intelligence is located somewhere in the
vicinity of it, and by continually focusing our attention there we may
become familiar with its office and work.

Abraham represents man in the first awakening of his faith, when he is
dominated by it. The very name has come to be almost a synonym for
faith. Abraham

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

was dwelling in a realm of limited thought, and he was called out by
Spirit into a great expansion of all his thoughts and powers through
faith. All the people and places mentioned in connection with his
history have a symbolical meaning. They represent other faculties and
phases of mind that are called into expression along with faith.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 12:1-5. Now Jehovah said unto Abram, Get thee
out of  
thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's  
house, unto the land that I will show thee: and I will make  
of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy  
name great; and be thou a blessing: and I will bless them  
that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse:  
and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.  
So Abram went, as Jehovah had spoken unto him; and Lot went  
with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he  
departed out of Haran. And Abram took Sarai his wife, and  
Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they  
had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran;  
and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into  
the land of Canaan they came.  
</span>

</div>

The movement in consciousness represented in this Scripture is that of
an individual who has been spiritually inactive or laggard. The name of
Abraham's father Terah signifies "loitering." The Lord or spiritual
impulse within presses forth to religious activity. It virtually says,
"Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy
father's \[loiterer's\] house, unto the land that I will show thee."

When this call comes, lofty ideas begin to possess the mind. The name in
its original form, Abram, means "exalted father." Faith in the unseen
God and

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

in divine guidance inspires lofty thoughts that become part of the
consciousness without special effort when man is obedient to the call of
Spirit. To those who depend on the evidence of the senses it may be
blind faith, but it works out beautifully in the life of those who are
true to it.

When Abraham went to seek a new country (consciousness) in response to
the call of the Spirit, Lot went with him. The name Lot means "hidden,"
"concealed," "covert," and Lot represents the negative side of faith.
When faith (Abraham) expands in consciousness (in a new and greater
country), its old subconscious element (Lot) expands also. Lot may also
be said to symbolize the part of man that is still in darkness; in other
words, the natural or animal man. This part of man's nature he cannot
escape, but must take with him into the new country. He can, however, by
association, lift it up and increase its capacity, as Abraham "lifted
up" and aided Lot, for we read that Lot prospered as well.

(For further interpretation of Abraham and Lot see commentary on Gen.
13.)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 12:6-9. And Abram passed through the land unto
the  
place of Shechem, unto the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite  
was then in the land. And Jehovah appeared unto Abram, and  
said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there  
builded he an altar unto Jehovah, who appeared unto him.  
And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of  
Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west,  
and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto  
Jehovah, and called upon the name of Jehovah. And Abram  
journeyed, going on still toward the South.  
</span>

</div>

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

In this instance Canaan represents the pure elements of the natural
body. Moreh represents the mind that is receptive to Truth; a
tabernacle. In a tabernacle state of mind the constructive methods that
are always characteristic of the divine are revealed, and in this state
of mind protection and strength (oak tree) are realized, and victory is
assured.

The "oak of Moreh" may also be said to represent a nerve center in the
body, and the tabernacle an aggregation of cells.

The name Shechem means "inclining," "shoulder." Shechem represents man's
wholly material thoughts about himself and the universe, which tend to
make life a burden.

The name Beth-el means "house of God." Beth-el represents the
understanding that all seemingly material things in reality have their
origin in Spirit.

The name Ai means "heap of ruins." Ai refers to egotism and
self-confidence without recognition of Spirit. These qualities are
counterfeits of faith; they are destructive of the building of a truly
spiritual character and must be put away so that the individual may come
into a knowledge of his unity with God.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 12:10. And there was a famine in the land: and
Abram  
went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was  
sore in the land.  
</span>

</div>

There was a famine in Abraham's land, and this caused him to go down
into Egypt. Egypt represents the realm of substance and life in the
depths of the body consciousness. In a sense this is a region of
darkness and mystery, yet it is a great kingdom rich in substance and
essential to the preservation of the body.

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

It refers to the vitality of the abdominal region. Those who have not
attained an all-round understanding of the divine law do not know how to
affirm the flow of a steady current of life from below to feed the flame
of intelligence above, and therefore they have periods of bodily
exhaustion. In this condition they seem to lose divine guidance and are
plunged into apparent darkness (Egypt). This is a very necessary
adjustment however.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 12:11-20. And it came to pass, when he was come
near  
to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife,  
Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:  
and it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see  
thee, that they will say, This is his wife: and they will  
kill me, but they will save thee alive. Say, I pray thee,  
thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for thy  
sake, and that my soul may live because of thee. And it  
came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the  
Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. And the  
princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh: and  
the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. And he dealt well  
with Abram for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and  
he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and  
she-asses, and camels. And Jehovah plagued Pharaoh and his  
house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife.  
And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou  
hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was  
thy wife? why saidst thou, She is my sister, so that I took  
her to be my wife? now therefore behold thy wife, take her,  
and go thy way. And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him:  
and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that  
he had.  
</span>

</div>

Here again we see the result of a lack of spiritual

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

understanding. Pharaoh represents "the sun." He is the ruler of the
solar plexus, the sun center in the subconscious mind. This is obscurity
or "Egypt" to the conscious mind. Pharaoh's (the sun's) being in Egypt
points to the truth that the light of the sun of righteousness is veiled
by our life on the lower or sense plane. Pharaoh also signifies the
whole house, the whole body consciousness; he is the force that rules
the body under the natural regime.

Sarai represents the soul not yet regenerated and under divine law
should not be allowed to unite with Pharaoh (physical sensation). Not
having the divine understanding when he was drawn down into Egypt (seat
of the vital processes), Abram allowed Sarai (his unregenerate love,
affection, and emotion) to become united with Pharaoh (the dominating
physical ego) and this brought plagues upon the land of Egypt (bodily
ills).

Metaphysicians regenerating their bodies through the power of the spoken
word should heed this lesson. When quickening, cleansing, and
readjusting the cells at their life center, they should silently
declare:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The sensation of the flesh cannot hold my love, for
my  
love is the daughter of God, and we are joined in purity  
and pure desire in my Father's house."  
</span>

</div>

Thus they may escape the plagues of Egypt and the rebuke of Pharaoh:
"What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me
that she was thy wife?"

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 13:1. And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and
his  
wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South.  
</span>

</div>

Abram went up out of the land of Egypt, "and Lot

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

with him"; for the time had not yet come when Abram could part with Lot
(the subjective) and dwell in the Promised Land (the purely spiritual
consciousness).

Lot can also be said to symbolize the part of man's consciousness that
is still spiritually undeveloped. In other words, Lot represents the
natural or animal man. Abram still had much growth to make before he
could sustain a consciousness of Spirit. He was unable as yet to cross
out the material side of his nature. He still had faith in materiality
and a dual vision as to the fulfillment of the Scriptures. He saw the
negative as well as the positive; evil as well as good.

Until the Christ Mind is firmly established in the individual he retains
a certain residue of faith in negative appearances. This divided state
of mind causes confusion and discord.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 13:2-4. And Abram was very rich in cattle, in
silver,  
and in gold. And he went on his journeys from the South  
even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at  
the beginning, between Beth-el and Ai.  
</span>

</div>

Abram (faith) while in Egypt accumulates rich substance ideas, which are
necessary for a well-balanced mind and body. Bethel (house of God)
represents the perfect body ideal. Ai (heap of rubbish) represents the
physical manifestation with an increased appreciation and possession of
life and substance (cattle, silver, and gold).

The return from Egypt is symbolical of man's return to his
divine-natural consciousness. This was not a single event; it is
something that occurs again and again in the Bible story, and is
repeated in the case of every individual who comes into a realization of

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

his spiritual oneness with God. The whole nation of Israel was called
out of Egypt to assume its destiny of bringing forth the fruit unto
righteousness and life everlasting, to play a part in the restitution of
the race to its Edenic state. This is the essence of the covenant. Jesus
came up out of Egypt where His parents had taken Him as a child. Abram
(faith) did not remain long in Egypt (sense consciousness).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 13:5-7. And Lot also, who went with Abram, had
flocks,  
and herds, and tents. And the land was not able to bear  
them, that they might dwell together: for their substance  
was great, so that they could not dwell together. And there  
was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the  
herdsmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the  
Perizzite dwelt then in the land.  
</span>

</div>

It was Abraham rather than Lot who suggested the separation. When man
reaches a certain point in his spiritual development he realizes that he
must let go of everything that retards his progress. Lot is typical of
the natural man, always eager to take the best for himself. He chose the
plain of the Jordan because it was "like the land of Egypt."

True faith in God is separated from all negative belief that the body is
material, impure, or transient. The herdsmen of Abraham were separated
from the herdsmen of Lot. The time comes when by reason of the increase
of faith or substance these two types of mind cannot dwell together:
"the land was not able to bear them." So the senses of the man who has
centered his faith on the invisible are by degrees separated from the
appeal of his lower nature and become true herdsmen of his enduring
thoughts. As a true seer

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

his vision is fixed on the changeless reality inhabiting all form, the
substance of which all visible manifestation is but the configuration.
His ear becomes attuned to the unbroken harmony of life that is
permeating his mind and body and the world about him. He learns so to
direct his thought of Spirit substance that if a belief in material
imperfection should find lodgment in his consciousness one touch of his
mind would release the hidden spring that opens the way to healing of
the body.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 13:8-12. And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be
no  
strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my  
herdsmen and thy herdsmen; for we are brethren. Is not the  
whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from  
me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the  
right; or if thou take the right hand, then I will go to  
the left. And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the  
Plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered every where,  
before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the  
garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as thou goest  
unto Zoar. So Lot chose him all the Plain of the Jordan;  
and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the  
one from the other. Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and  
Lot dwelt in the cities of the Plain, and moved his tent as  
far as Sodom.  
</span>

</div>

When we put our faith wholeheartedly in spiritual reality and follow our
ideal without wavering, we are willing to allow sense consciousness the
choice of its own field of action. Abraham gave Lot his choice of land.
When we withdraw our interest from the natural man, there is a
separation. True thought and untrue thought cannot intermingle.

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

Canaan means "lowland," but it is here that Abraham lived after his
separation from Lot. Is it not significant that this "lowland" became
the Promised Land, the land "flowing with milk and honey"? True faith,
which works through love, has power to refine the body and so make it
the promised land of the soul. When man rediscovers this lost domain,
the promises of the Scriptures will be fulfilled.

Every faculty of the mind has an active and a passive side, an objective
and a subjective, a positive and a negative. Abraham represents the
faculty of faith in its positive expression. To complete the symbol we
find Lot ("hidden," "concealed") representing the negative or
undeveloped aspect of faith. His domain is the flesh. He accompanied
Abraham into Egypt and back again. When they separated, Lot chose to
dwell in the "Plain of the Jordan . . . like the land of Egypt, as thou
goest unto Zoar." The river Jordan here symbolizes the descending flow
of thought running through the organism from head to foot. When mortal
beliefs rule the individual, the life flow is muddy with sense concepts
and turbulent with materiality. The Jordan is noted as a muddy stream.
Zoar ("smallness," "littleness") represents that which is inferior. We
should beware how we link our I AM consciousness with the faith that is
established in the flesh, typified by Lot.

(For Sodom and Gomorrah see interpretation of Gen. 10).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 13:13-18. Now the men of Sodom were wicked and
sinners  
against Jehovah exceedingly. And Jehovah said unto Abram,  
after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine  
eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward and  
</span>

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

southward and eastward and westward: for all the land which  
thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for  
ever. And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so  
that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then may  
thy seed also be numbered. Arise, walk through the land in  
the length of it and in the breadth of it; for unto thee  
will I give it. And Abram moved his tent, and came and  
dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built  
there an altar unto Jehovah.  

</div>

Hebron ("community," "alliance," "friendship") represents an association
of ideas; in other words, concentration. Spiritual unfoldment always
causes one to direct toward God's children everywhere a kindly feeling
that is constant, deep, tender. Ability to do this is one of the
indispensable qualifications of every successful spiritual leader.

Mamre ("firmness," "vigor," "strength") refers to the front brain, the
seat of conscious thought. The lesson here is that faith in God
(Abraham) brings about the right relationship among all the associated
faculties, and withal an enduring firmness, vigor, and strength. Mamre
in the sense of "fatness," "abundantly supplied," "well-fed," refers to
a consciousness of substance and riches. The qualities represented by
Mamre are not of the highest spiritual consciousness, the Christ Mind,
but they belong more to the spiritually awakening intellect of the
individual.

In Truth a person does not have to change his residence in order to
enter a new country. "The land which thou seest" refers to a new concept
of substance. When we deny our attachment to matter and material
conditions and affirm our unity with spiritual substance, we enter the
new consciousness of real substance.

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

Substance is not confined to matter; it is the idea that is the firm
foundation of all that we conceive to be permanent.

Abraham's moving his tent signifies that the center of consciousness
changed; in this case from a lower to a higher plane.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 14:1-11. And it came to pass in the days of
Amraphel  
king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king  
of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, that they made war with  
Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah,  
Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the  
king of Bela (the same is Zoar). All these joined together  
in the vale of Siddim (the same is the Salt Sea). Twelve  
years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year  
they rebelled. And in the fourteenth year came  
Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote  
the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and  
the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, and the Horites in their  
mount Seir, unto El-paran, which is by the wilderness. And  
they returned, and came to En-mishpat (the same is Kadesh),  
and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the  
Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon-tamar. And there went out  
the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king  
of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela  
(the same is Zoar); and they set the battle in array  
against them in the vale of Siddim; against Chedorlaomer  
king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of  
Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the  
five. Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and  
the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there,  
and they that remained fled to the mountain. And they took  
all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their  
victuals, and went their way.  
</span>

</div>

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

Amraphel ("keeper of the treasures," "speaker of mysteries") represents
the belief of unawakened man that in generation, in physical
reproduction, he is fulfilling the creative law of Being.

Shinar ("two rivers," "divided stream," "divided mind") represents a
belief in two powers, an evil as well as a good power, and error
results.

Arioch ("lionlike," "venerable") represents the seeming power, strength,
and ("lionlike") dominion that sex lust has over man; also the belief so
prevalent among all peoples that the secret desires and habits
pertaining to the sex life must be good and must have been ordained of
God because of ages of acceptance and practice. Therefore they are
regarded as sacred ("venerable").

Ellasar ("strong rebellion," "oath of Assyria," "oak of Assyria")
represents a state of consciousness whose central thought and belief has
to do with sex on the physical plane. It does not look to Spirit for its
strength and power but trusts in the "mind of the flesh."

Chedorlaomer ("handful of sheaves," "roundness of a sheaf") represents
the generative function of the body given over to the expression of sex
lust.

Elam ("hidden," "concealed," "everlasting") represents thoughts of the
abidingness, resourcefulness, and creative power of Truth. The natural
man may not know the truth of his being; it may be hidden under the
debris of sense thought and belief. It will come to light in due time
however and will bring forth its fruit of perfection in the life of
every individual.

Tidal ("veneration," "awe," "fear") represents the prominent place that
sensuality has in the material and carnal states of consciousness that
belong to the outer,

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

animal man; also the fearfulness that results from sense expression.

Goiim ("Gentiles," "people, especially foreign") represents the carnal,
material thoughts and states of consciousness that belong to the outer
man (Gentile).

Bera ("spontaneous gift," "son of desire," "son of evil") represents the
directing thoughts and desires of the sensual state of consciousness
denoted by Sodom.

(For Sodom see interpretation of Gen. 10.)

Birsha ("son of wickedness," "son of impiety," "fat with evil") was King
of Gomorrah in Abraham's time. The name Gomorrah means "material force,"
"tyranny," "oppression." Gomorrah denotes a state of mind that is
adverse to the law of Spirit. This state of mind has to do with the
submerged or hidden subconscious phase of man's sensual life. Birsha
represents the ruling thought in this state of consciousness in the
individual.

Shinab ("sharpened desire," "father of mutation," "father of
transgression") represents the presiding thought of the state of
consciousness denoted by Admah.

Admah ("dumb," "unrelenting," "tomb") represents the seeming strength
and mercilessness of the death thought and condition that enters into
man's experience as the result of his carnal, material, adverse thoughts
and activities.

Shemeber ("superior brilliance," "high flight," "superior name")
represents the innate spiritual ideal implanted in man from the
beginning that causes him to grow, unfold, and unceasingly desire and
seek to attain a higher and better understanding.

Zeboiim ("wars," "rending with the teeth") represents ravenous
appetites, sensual passions, the wild-beast

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

nature holding sway in the subconsciousness. The fact that Shemeber was
King of Zeboiim shows that the perfect-man idea of God is implanted in
the physical being of man as well as in his more inner spiritual
consciousness.

Zoar ("reduced," "lessened") denotes inferiority. It was one of the
wicked cities of the plain belonging to Moab (carnal mind).

Bela ("swallow up," "utterly consume or destroy") represents the
destructive tendencies in consciousness. The city of Bela symbolizes a
group of destroying, consuming thoughts. It suggests the destroying of
letting go of error by denial, an absorption or "swallowing up" of error
by Truth or of darkness by light, thus doing away with the error.

Siddim ("extensions," "stony land") represents the very lowest material
idea and manifestation of substance in the sense consciousness and the
body consciousness of the individual.

Rephaim ("bonds," "terrors," "giants") was the name of a people of great
stature, and Rephaim represents the seeming strength of binding,
fear-producing, opposing thoughts in consciousness at a certain stage of
man's unfoldment into Truth.

Ashteroth-karnaim ("horned Ashteroth," "Ashteroth of two peaks")
represents the state of consciousness in man that attributes double
honor, authority, and power to purely intellectual understanding and
capacity. In this state of consciousness man does not recognize that God
instead of intellect is the source of intelligence. The intellect
borrows its real light from Spirit, just as the moon, which has no light
of its own, reflects light from the sun. Ashteroth refers to the

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

moon or intellect, while Karnaim (two horns or peaks) suggests
exultation and power.

Zuzim ("glittering," "flowing out like rays," "sprouting," "restless")
was the name of a people "in Ham." Zuzim represents the confusion,
fears, unrestrained emotions, and general terrors of the physical
consciousness of "mind of the flesh," seemingly very prominent and
flourishing at a certain stage in the evolution or unfoldment of the
individual.

Ham ("inferior," "hot") represents the material consciousness in man.

Emim ("the terrible," "formidable people," "objects of terror," that is,
"idols") was the name of a race of giants in Shaveh-kiriathaim.
Metaphysically Emim represents giant terrors and fears in human
consciousness that are a result of man's believing in the outer, formed
world and the conditions that man has built up as being real and true.

Shaveh-kiriathaim ("plain of the twin cities," "plain of the double
meetings") is the name of a place. The name Shaveh means "a plain," and
Shaveh represents an equalized, poised state of mind and body. The name
Kiriathaim means "double city," and Kiriathaim denotes double strength
or supply. Shaveh-kiriathaim thus denotes poise and equilibrium in the
consciousness and the organism, doubly established and sure.

The Horites ("cave dwellers," "dwellers in black holes"), inhabitants of
Edom, represent forces in action in man's physical organism, more
especially the deep-seated, subconscious, fleshly forces and tendencies.

Seir ("bristling," "hairy," "rough," "horror") represents the physical
or sense consciousness in man.

El-paran ("strength of Paran," "oak of the region

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

of the caves") denotes the seeming strength of the multitude of confused
and undisciplined thoughts and energies in man's subconscious mind that
are given over to the furtherance of sense expression.

En-mishpat ("fountain of judgment," "fountain of right") symbolizes the
truth that under the law of adjustment, when it reaches a certain point
in expression, sense indulgence destroys the very error desires that
keep it active in consciousness. Then these desires die for lack of fuel
to keep them alive.

The name Kadesh means "holy," "consecrated," "a sanctuary." Kadesh
represents the divine presence within the individual consciousness.

The Amalekites ("warlike," "valley dweller," "that licks up") represent
the base desires of the individual; the animal forces, appetites, and
passions of the subconscious mind.

(For Amorites see interpretation of Gen. 10.)

Hazazon-tamar ("a division of palms," "felling of palms," "victory
divided") represents a divided mind. This mind must be conquered before
one can become fearless and so gain a real victory over error. When the
thoughts are divided the results are divided.

This whole Scripture reveals the working out of sense on the lowest
plane of consciousness. The kings in this chapter who served
Chedorlaomer for twelve years and then rebelled represent ruling
thoughts in the hidden sense consciousness of man. Error fights error,
destroying much of it, and the remainder is lifted up (flees to the
mountain) and eventually is absorbed by Truth. We often refer to this
movement of mind as a transmuting process. A close study of these verses
tells us that even in battling with sex

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

the Spirit of the Lord is constantly working, through the law of sowing
and reaping, to unveil to man's consciousness a higher way of life.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 14:12. And they took Lot, Abram's brother's
son, who  
dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.  
</span>

</div>

Lot and all his possessions were carried away by Chedorlaomer and the
kings with him, who symbolize the rule of sensuality in man. These sense
beliefs and desires have seemingly overpowered the negative side of
faith that Lot symbolizes. The power of this side of faith has been
taken over to build up and sustain flesh that is ruled over by carnal
thought. But when knowledge of this occurrence comes to the positive
side of the faith faculty in the individual (Abraham) who has come up
out of material thought (Egypt) and passed to a higher concept of God
(Hebrew), let us see what happens. Positive faith (Abraham) gets into
action with a thought power that destroys sense rule (Chedorlaomer and
his allies) and restores negative faith (Lot) to its rightful place in
consciousness.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 14:13-20. And there came one that had escaped,

these were confederate with Abram. And when Abram heard  
that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his  
trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen,  
and pursued as far as Dan. And he divided himself against  
them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and  
pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of  
Damascus. And he brought back all the goods, and also  
brought back his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women  
also, and the

people. And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after  
his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings  
that were with him, at the vale of Shaveh (the same is the  
King's Vale). And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth  
bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High. And he  
blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of God Most High,  
possessor of heaven and earth: and blessed be God Most  
High, who hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand. And  
he gave him a tenth of all.  

</div>

Mamre ("strength"), Aner ("adolescent youth"), and Eshcol
("fruitfulness"), the Amorites who "were confederate with Abram,"
suggest thoughts of vigor and abundant substance inspired by faith.
These thoughts are apparently material in expression (Amorites), yet
they are friendly toward the individual's higher concepts or faith in
God (Abraham), because in reality their true origin is Spirit. They lend
their conception of strength and power to the aid of faith while it is
gaining its victory over error.

Faith brings into action all its accumulated wisdom and understanding
("he led forth his trained men") and makes a union with the judgment
faculty (Dan). Then faith strikes at the very root of sensuality, the
mortal man's belief that life is material. This belief is the hiding or
lurking place (Hobah) for the error thoughts symbolized by the kings who
took Lot captive.

We can never fully overcome sensuality until we put away belief in
materiality. We must know that our whole being, including the body, is
not material but spiritual. By sowing according to belief in the flesh
we reap the corruption of the flesh, but by sowing

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

according to Spirit we reap eternal life. (Damascus also, like Hobah,
signifies a state of consciousness founded on a material conception of
life in the body.)

We find a rich symbology in the story of Abraham's victorious return
from the battle. He was met at the "vale of Shaveh" (which means
"plain," a level place, a place of equality) by Melchizedek (whose name
means "king of righteousness"), priest of God, who here symbolizes the
Christ consciousness in the individual. The King of Sodom also met and
greeted Abraham on the "plain" of equality (Shaveh). He here represents
the ruling power in the physical.

When the Christ consciousness rules in both the mind and the body, the
individual is established in right thinking and right doing
(righteousness). Then he has come to the place of peace, poise,
equilibrium, and wholeness signified by Shaveh. When this place is
reached in both the inner and the outer consciousness (Salem and Sodom)
there is a great increase of substance and of life in one's realization.
This increase comes from the higher spiritual mind within, the Christ,
and is symbolized by the bread and the wine that Melchizedek gave to
Abraham. Melchizedek blessed Abraham and blessed God, and Abraham gave
him "a tenth of all." When a person realizes that his victories are
gained by the power of God alone, he should willingly use a tenth of his
increase of power, understanding, and substance for the furtherance of
the Christ Truth.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 14:21-24. And the king of Sodom said unto
Abram, Give  
me the persons, and take the goods to thyself. And Abram  
said to the king of Sodom,  
</span>

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

I have lifted up my hand unto Jehovah, God Most High,  
possessor of heaven and earth, that I will not take a  
thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine, lest  
thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich: save only that  
which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men  
that went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take  
their portion.  

</div>

Abraham refused the proffered gifts of the King of Sodom (sense man),
which teaches us that there must be a lifting up and transmuting of the
seeming material life and substance in the body before it can be
utilized by the higher faculties of the mind. None of the credit for the
multiplication of substance and strength should be given to the mortal
in man's nature. Spirit gives all the increase of good.

Abram represents the spiritual ego, and the King of Sodom represents the
personal, the physical ego. The spiritual ego or spiritual man has its
first development on the physical plane. The two egos, the spiritual and
the physical, are united there in appropriating physical things,
personal things, that they consider valuable, such as appetites,
passions, and other things on the sense plane. The spiritual man
advances or develops beyond that. He does not want these things, so he
gives them all to the personality, the physical ego. Then the physical
man is willing to give up anything to the spiritual man, and he will
claim that he supplied the spiritual man. That is the glorification of
the personality. The personal man claims that he is the whole thing,
that everything belongs to him. It is personal selfishness, and the
spiritual man does not want to be told that he got anything from the
physical. He gets his things from the realm of ideas, the spiritual
realm.

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

Man is prone to feel that the outer or sense world is the source of his
good, at least a measure of it. But in order fully to realize our
sonship and our divine heritage, we must hold fast to Spirit. We must
see Spirit as our only cause and sustenance. We have a tendency to plead
the cause of the good in our sense nature. This is characteristic of all
of us. We try hard to save some of our sense thoughts and secret habits.
We have indulged in them so long (and our ancestors before us did
likewise, beyond the memory of man) that we cannot help thinking there
is some good in them. However we, like Abraham, must keep our vision
high. We must hold steadfastly to the realization that God is the one
source of all, that in spirit and in truth all is good.

The young ("immature") men who went with Abram had partaken ("eaten") of
the pleasures of sense. They represent the primitive understanding, and
as such they are excused from the operation of the spiritual law. The
plane of activity for life and strength at a certain stage of man's
development is the physical, material plane. During this stage God in
His grace grants to man, when his motive is pure, a degree of immunity
from the effects of his ignorant transgression of the divine law.
