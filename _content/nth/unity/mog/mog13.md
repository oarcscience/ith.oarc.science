###  Chapter XI Joseph a Type of the Christ Genesis 37, 38, 39, 40, and 41 

MAN, AN IDEA in Divine Mind, is manifested in various states of
consciousness. These appear outwardly as personalities and take form as
bodies. In describing states of consciousness the Bible uses the
personality in a representative sense, with the meaning of the name as a
key to the state of being explained.

The meaning of the name Joseph is "whom Jehovah will add to." He
represents the "increasing" faculty of the mind, that state of
consciousness in which we increase in all phases of our character. This
is especially true of substance; for Joseph as imagination molds mind
substance in the realm of forms. He had a coat of many colors; his
dreams were always of forms and shapes--the sheaves of wheat, the stars
and moon. An interpreter of dreams, the phenomenal was his field of
action. This formative power is characteristic of the imagination, and
among the twelve primal faculties of mind we find that this faculty of
the imagination is represented by Joseph.

The Joseph faculty is the dreamer of dreams and the seer of visions,
which are expressed always in forms and symbols. If you are a vivid
dreamer and can correctly interpret your own dreams, you may know that
you are developing your Joseph faculty. However, it is one thing to
dream and quite another to interpret

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

dreams correctly. All people dream more or less, but few can interpret
dreams. Visions come under the same head, for dreams are not necessarily
the sole concomitant of sleep.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 37:1-8. And Jacob dwelt in the land of his
father's  
sojournings, in the land of Canaan. These are the  
generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old,  
was feeding the flock with his brethren; and he was a lad  
with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his  
father's wives: and Joseph brought the evil report of them  
unto his father. Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his  
children, because he was the son of his old age: and he  
made him a coat of many colors. And his brethren saw that  
their father loved him more than all his brethren; and they  
hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.  
And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren:  
and they hated him yet the more. And he said unto them,  
Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed: for,  
behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my  
sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your  
sheaves came round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.  
And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over  
us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they  
hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.  
</span>

</div>

Joseph represents the faculty of imagination. This faculty produces the
pictures or images that make visible every idea that the mind can
conceive and reveals to the illumined intellect (Jacob) the activities
of the other faculties (Joseph's brothers; in this case the sons of
Bilhah and Zilpah).

Joseph was the proud owner of a coat of many colors, a gift from his
father. The coat is the symbol

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

of the Truth given to us by the Father. Truth in its entirety is
symbolized by the seamless garment that Jesus wore, for it cannot be
separated into divisions or parts. All truth is one Truth. Joseph's coat
being of many colors indicates that when we open up this new realm of
consciousness and begin to use the imagination, our conception of Truth
is colored by the many previous mental states that have so long herded
our flocks of thoughts. At this stage we have not yet come into the
understanding, into the pure white light of unqualified Truth, that is
symbolized by the seamless robe of unity.

The home of the imagination is in the realm of ideas, where another
dimension of mind is opened to it, even the kingdom of the heavens. The
imaging faculty gives man the ability to project himself through time
and space and thus rise above these limitations as well as all other
limitations. Even when the conscious mind is asleep the imagination
continues its activity and we have dreams.

As we have learned, we cannot take our dreams literally but must
interpret them by means of the symbols given us. For instance, Joseph's
dream about the sheaves was a dream about substance and a prophecy of
his attainment of a superior consciousness of universal substance. That
consciousness of substance afterward brought forth fruit when he
supervised the storage of grain in Egypt, and this grain furnished
needed supply to his father and brothers and brought them to him.
Imagination uses ideas to increase its store of universal substance and
clothes ideas in form; for it is both a formative and an increasing
faculty.

An uncontrolled imagination will often exaggerate

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

and increase one's consciousness of trivial or even unreal things until
both mind and body are affected. (Joseph carried tales about his
brothers to his father.) The imagination is a very powerful faculty, and
we must learn to discipline it if we would make it practical in serving
our highest good. By following the inspiration of the supermind or
Jehovah consciousness we can control the imagination and direct its work
to practical ends.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 37:9-22. And he dreamed yet another dream, and
told it  
to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed yet a  
dream; and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars  
made obeisance to me. And he told it to his father, and to  
his brethren; and his father rebuked him, and said unto  
him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and  
thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down  
ourselves to thee to the earth? And his brethren envied  
him; but his father kept the saying in mind.  
And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in  
Shechem. And Israel said unto Joseph, Are not thy brethren  
feeding the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee  
unto them. And he said to him, Here am I. And he said to  
him, Go now, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and  
well with the flock; and bring me word again. So he sent  
him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. And  
a certain man found him, and behold, he was wandering in  
the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest  
thou? And he said, I am seeking my brethren: tell me, I  
pray thee, where they are feeding the flock. And the man  
said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us  
go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found  
them in Dothan.  
And they saw him afar off, and before he came  
</span>

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him. And  
they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. Come  
now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into one  
of the pits, and we will say, An evil beast hath devoured  
him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams. And  
Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and  
said, Let us not take his life. And Reuben said unto them,  
Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the  
wilderness, but lay no hand upon him: that he might deliver  
him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.  

</div>

In the foregoing Scripture Joseph's dream is very significant. Jacob's
words "Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down
ourselves to thee to the earth?" are self-explanatory.

Shechem denotes a thought of burdens, which reveals that the brothers
took to heart Joseph's superior attitude. Joseph's talebearing
propensity and the fact that their father loved Joseph better than he
did his brothers served to stir up the antagonism of the other sons
toward Joseph. Jacob (the I AM) (functioning in Hebron, which means
"united," "bound by a common bond") sent Joseph (the imagination) down
into Shechem ("bending down," "a burden") to see how his brothers (the
other faculties) fared. Jacob (the I AM) operating in the consciousness
of friendship and unity did not take seriously the contention that
Joseph (the boasting imagination) had brought about.

The name Dothan means "two wells," "edicts," "customs." Dothan
symbolizes the double standard of thought that man holds regarding his
life and substance, the law of Being on the one hand, custom on the
other. His customary beliefs lead to limited, warped

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

experiences, while an understanding of the true law of Being increases
the activity of the power of God in his life and also makes him
conscious of that activity. (Dothan is the place where Joseph found his
brethren.)

Reuben, symbolizing the faculty of discernment in the outer, suggested
the pit (which represents a pitfall or trap), intending later to deliver
Joseph and thus restore him to the arms of his father.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 37:23-28. And it came to pass, when Joseph was
come  
unto his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat,  
the coat of many colors that was on him; and they took him,  
and cast him into the pit: and the pit was empty, there was  
no water in it.  
And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their  
eyes and looked, and, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was  
coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery and  
balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt. And Judah  
said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our  
brother and conceal his blood? Come, and let us sell him to  
the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he  
is our brother, our flesh. And his brethren hearkened unto  
him. And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen; and they  
drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph  
to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they  
brought Joseph into Egypt.  
</span>

</div>

Gilead represents the high place in consciousness where Spirit discerns
and witnesses to what is true and to all man's thoughts and acts so that
an adjustment may be made throughout mind and body. The Ishmaelites
represent the fruit of the thought of the natural man at work in the
flesh; also the consciousness that recognizes God but that, because of
the seeming opposition of the outer world, does not find expression

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

according to the highest standard.

The Midianites were enemies of the Israelites. The Midianites represent
discrimination or judgment employed according to human standards.
Judging according to outer appearances produces discordant thoughts and
jealousies and their kin.

The fact that Joseph was sold as a slave into Egypt by his brothers
signifies that at a certain stage of his unfoldment man will barter away
his high ideals of Truth in order to go on living in sense
consciousness. He will even debase his imagination (Joseph) and send it
down into his body consciousness to stir up his emotions and get the
thrill of sensation. However the faculty of imagination, if it has been
trained and disciplined, will work for the good of man even in the
darkened realm of sense (Egypt). Though the purpose in selling Joseph
into Egypt was error, the result proved to be good. This shows the
outworking of the law stated in Romans 8:28: "To them that love God all
things work together for good." Even when error seems to be in the
ascendancy there is that in us which remains true to God and finally
brings about our deliverance. "The wrath of man shall praise thee."

The great point in the story is that Joseph, even when overcome by error
from without and sold into Egyptian slavery, still remained true to the
divine ideas of his Father. In any department of life the imagination
will work for the development and perfection of the individual or for
the direct opposite of this, depending on how it has been trained. It is
a powerful faculty, for it forms ideas in substance and brings desire
into manifestation. If the desires are allowed to run riot on the sense
plane, the imagination will proceed directly

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

to bring them into manifestation as inharmony or disease. On the other
hand, when the imagination is kept busy with high ideas, ideas
originally inspired in it by the I AM, it is the most effective of all
the faculties for the work of spiritual development. Faithfulness to
high ideas, when coupled with an unshaken confidence in the I AM, cannot
be wholly overcome by error, nor can anyone who exercises these
faculties be kept for long in the background.

Judah (representing prayer and praise), the fourth son of Jacob and
Leah, suggested the idea of selling Joseph into Egypt rather than taking
his life.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 37:29-36. And Reuben returned unto the pit;
and,  
behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.  
And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is  
not; and I, whither shall I go? And they took Joseph's  
coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the  
blood; and they sent the coat of many colors, and they  
brought it to their father, and said, This have we found:  
know now whether it is thy son's coat or not. And he knew  
it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath  
devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces. And  
Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins,  
and mourned for his son many days. And all his sons and all  
his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be  
comforted; and he said, For I will go down to Sheol to my  
son mourning. And his father wept for him. And the  
Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of  
Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard.  
</span>

</div>

Jacob represents intellectual illumination. However illumination on the
intellectual plane often lacks discernment; it has not attained the
power to express the sure, steady, revealing light of Spirit. Jacob was
in the

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

dark as regards the fate of his son Joseph (symbolical of the
imagination). Hence Jacob was deceived by blood on the coat and mourned
with the crowd.

Among the twelve faculties the imagination is least understood in its
evolution from sense to soul consciousness. To this day those who
function in sense echo the brothers of Joseph in their slighting
exclamation, "Here comes that dreamer." Yet in art, science, literature,
religion, and even business the cry is "Give us men of imagination!" The
fact is there is no progress of man or the race without expansion of the
imagination. The history of Joseph, the attempts of those nearest and
dearest to him to thwart the unfoldment of his innate ability, and his
final victory in attaining the exalted office of prime minister of
Egypt, shows us in symbols how the whole man will eventually be
glorified in Spirit.

However in the early stages of the Joseph quickening all the other
faculties combine to destroy it; they think it visionary and
impractical.

The blood-drenched coat represents the futile attempt of the outer realm
of sense to kill out the inner Spirit life. Life marches on and the
vision of the soul finds new expression in other states of
consciousness.

Pharaoh represents the ego or will that rules the body under the natural
law. Potiphar symbolizes the executive arm of the will.

Sheol is the abode of the dead conceived by the Hebrews as a
subterranean region clothed in thick darkness. It represents the mental
gloom into which the personal man is plunged when he gives himself over
to thoughts of death and grief.

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 38:1-11. And it came to pass at that time, that
Judah  
went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain  
Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. And Judah saw there a  
daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua; and he  
took her, and went in unto her. And she conceived, and bare  
a son; and he called his name Er. And she conceived again,  
and bare a son; and she called his name Onan. And she yet  
again bare a son, and called his name Shelah: and he was at  
Chezib, when she bare him. And Judah took a wife for Er his  
first-born, and her name was Tamar. And Er, Judah's  
first-born, was wicked in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah  
slew him. And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy  
brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husbands' brother  
unto her, and raise up seed to thy brother. And Onan knew  
that the seed would not be his; and it came to pass, when  
he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on  
the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother. And  
the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah:  
and he slew him also. Then said Judah to Tamar his  
daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in thy father's house, till  
Shelah my son be grown up; for he said, Lest he also die,  
like his brethren. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's  
house.  
</span>

</div>

The predominant thought in the minds of the people at that time was to
produce progeny (seed), and they restored to every device in order to
attain their end.

Hirah was an Adullamite, a friend of Judah. The name Hirah means
"splendid," "noble," "pure," "liberty." An Adullamite was a native of
the city of Addullam, which represents a state of poise in prayer in
which spiritual ideas flow into consciousness without obstruction. Being
in the valley, it would not refer to a

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

high, exalted state of mind in prayer but rather to an established
equilibrium and adjustment in the body consciousness. But even if at
first it seems to be only in the material consciousness, it imparts a
"splendid," "noble" quality to the man and leads toward true "liberty."
Such a state of consciousness is represented by Hirah.

Shua ("broad," "ample," "riches") represents the broad, rich thoughts of
abundant substance in the depths of the subconscious mind. Judah united
with a daughter of Shua, who symbolizes the feminine element in the rich
subconsciousness. Three sons were born to this union:

Er represents observant, vigilant thoughts. It matters a great deal what
one watches or gives attention to. If one persists in recognizing that
which appears to be evil, one cannot obtain abiding life and good. (Er
was wicked in the sight of Jehovah.)

Onan symbolizes thoughts pertaining to strength and vigor, yet thoughts
that are not spiritual but of the intellect. They are influenced too by
the lower emotions and tendencies of the carnal soul (Onan's mother was
a Canaanitish woman); therefore they are likely to bring about inharmony
and error because of the misdirection of energy. Yet in themselves these
thoughts are good and if directed by spiritual understanding yield great
blessings.

Shelah represents a sense of peace, harmony, and security that has come
about through prayer, affirmation, and desire. However Shelah was born
in Chezib, which symbolizes a deceptive state of mind that lies deep
within the elemental life forces of the individual. This deceptive state
of consciousness must be cleansed

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

thoroughly of its error, its double-minded, idolatrous belief in a power
of evil as well as a power of good, so that the truth of the one life
and the one God, good, may be established within its depths.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 38:12-30. And in process of time Shua's
daughter, the  
wife of Judah, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up  
unto his sheep-shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah  
the Adullamite. And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, thy  
father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep. And  
she put off from her the garments of her widowhood, and  
covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat  
in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for  
she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given  
unto him to wife. When Judah saw her, he thought her to be  
a harlot; for she had covered her face. And he turned unto  
her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me come in  
unto thee: for he knew not that she was his  
daughter-in-law. And she said, What wilt thou give me, that  
thou mayest come in unto me? And he said, I will send thee  
a kid of the goats from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou  
give me a pledge, till thou send it? And he said, What  
pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet and thy  
cord, and thy staff that is in thy hand. And he gave them  
to her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him. And  
she arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her,  
and put on the garments of her widowhood. And Judah sent  
the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the  
Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand:  
but he found her not. Then he asked the men of her place,  
saying, Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the  
wayside? And they said, There hath been no prostitute here.  
And he returned to Judah, and said, I have not found her;  
and also the men of the place said, There hath  
</span>

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

been no prostitute here. And Judah said, Let her take it to  
her, lest we be put to shame: behold, I sent this kid, and  
thou hast not found her.  
And it came to pass about three months after, that it was  
told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played  
the harlot; and moreover, behold, she is with child by  
whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be  
burnt. When she was brought forth, she sent to her  
father-in-law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I  
with child: and she said; Discern, I pray thee, whose are  
these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff. And Judah  
acknowledged them, and said, She is more righteous than I,  
forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew  
her again no more. And it came to pass in the time of her  
travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb. And it came  
to pass, when she travailed, that one put out a hand: and  
the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread,  
saying, This came out first. And it came to pass, as he  
drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and  
she said, Wherefore hast thou made a breach for thyself?  
therefore his name was called Perez. And afterward came out  
his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and  
his name was called Zerah.  

</div>

The name Judah means "praise Jehovah." Praise is closely related to
prayer; under the law of mind, whatever we praise we increase. Praise is
the key to the increase of life activity. If you depreciate your life
you decrease your consciousness of life. Thus we find that, besides
symbolizing the place in consciousness where we come in contact with the
highest activities of Divine Mind, Judah also represents the central
faculty of consciousness.

This faculty operates in the body consciousness

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

through the spinal cord, as well as in the top head, and finds its outer
expression through the life center, which, unregenerated, is Judas, who
hath a devil. When life is separated from the inner faculties and
endeavors to find expression without their co-operation, man gives
himself over to his animal nature and inclinations.

The name Tamar means "palm," "erect," "upright." Tamar represents
victory and conquest through uprightness. "And Judah . . . said, She is
more righteous than I, forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son."
This consciousness of victory or conquest and overcoming power is of the
soul in the individual.

Timnah symbolizes the error race belief that a share of the life forces
in man rightly belongs to the purely animal, physical, and sense part of
his being. Judah kept his sheep in this Canaanitish city. Sheep
represent the pure, natural life of the organism and Canaanites the
elemental life forces in man.

Enaim, in whose gate Tamar sat, is supposed to be one with the city of
Enam. The name means "two eyes," "double springs." It signifies the
fountain of understanding in man, which because of his belief in good
and evil, in materiality as well as spirituality, is dedicated to both
generation and regeneration, both sense and Spirit. Double-mindedness
causes instability. Stability is needed if one is to grow and develop
spiritually. One establishes stability of character by giving oneself up
wholly, with singleness of purpose, to the regenerative law.

The name Perez means "broken through," "torn asunder." Perez represents
victory through praise, or making a way out of apparent limitation and
error and prevailing over them by means of prayer and praise.

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

(Tamar said, "Wherefore hast thou made a breach for thyself? therefore
his name was called Perez.")

Zerah ("sunrise," "birth of a child," "germination of a seed")
represents awakening to new light, new understanding, in consciousness;
the first conscious awakening to the presence of this new inner light or
understanding. (The sun rises in the east, and the east denotes the
within.)

In the journey from sense to Spirit the soul passes through many phases,
misdirects its faculties, and practices multitudinous forms of
dissipation or waste. (These verses in Genesis illustrate this fact.)
But as man follows the light as it is given him to see the light, he
gradually learns to understand himself and his soul activities. Then he
begins to conform to spiritual law and to conserve his energies, forces,
and substance, which in turn results in lifting up the whole man,
spirit, soul, and body, out of the mire of materiality and sense into
the new estate of the regenerate man, the Jesus Christ man.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 39:1-3. And Joseph was brought down to Egypt;
and  
Potiphar, an Officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the  
guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hand of the  
Ishmaelites, that had brought him down thither. And Jehovah  
was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in  
the house of his master the Egyptian. And his master saw  
that Jehovah was with him, and that Jehovah made all that  
he did to prosper in his hand.  
</span>

</div>

Joseph's being brought down into Egypt signifies the imagination's
becoming active in the body consciousness and in the subconsciousness.
Imagination usually reaches out into the unseen world about us

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

and forms substance according to the pattern of our thoughts. But its
first duty is to go down into the Egyptian darkness of our material and
sense thoughts and, under the law, lift the body consciousness to a
higher plane. Body, soul, and spirit are unified as one, and the Truth
student cannot afford to lose sight of the fact that all three are to be
lifted up. Unless he is careful in this regard, the body consciousness
may be left far behind the soul and spirit and some unfavorable reaction
become manifest in the body or affairs.

The word Pharaoh means "the sun," "the Ra." Joseph was sold to Potiphar,
an executive officer of Pharaoh's court, who represents one of the
ruling ideas in the state of consciousness symbolized by Pharaoh, "the
sun." Egypt symbolizes the material body consciousness ruled by the
"sun" or solar plexus, which is the center in the subconsciousness.
Pharaoh rules in obscurity or darkness because the great sun of the
body, the solar plexus, is obscured or unknown to the conscious mind.
The light of the sun of righteousness is veiled by our conscious living
on the low plane of sense.

God prospers us when we give the best that is in us and do all things
unto Him, acknowledging Him in all our affairs. This is a sure way to
success, and when success does come we should realize that it resulted
from the work of Spirit in us, because we made ourselves channels
through which the Christ Mind could bring its ideas into manifestation.
The true Christian never boasts that he is a self-made man, for he well
knows that all that he is and has, together with all that he can ever
hope to be or to have, is but God finding expression through him as
life.

/quote

Gen. 39:4-6. And Joseph found favor in his sight, and he ministered unto
him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put
into his hand. And it came to pass from the time that he made him
overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that Jehovah blessed
the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of Jehovah was
upon all that he had, in the house and in the field. And he left all
that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not aught that was with him,
save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was comely, and well
favored.

Joseph was a spiritual character and worked from principle, hence he
found favor in Potiphar's house and brought added blessings to it. This
Scripture proves the simple outworking of the law. "And Joseph was
comely, and well favored."

wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what is with me in the  
house, and he hath put all that he hath into my hand: he is  
not greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back  
anything from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how  
then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?  
And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day,  
that he hearkened not unto her, to lie with her, or to be  
with her. And it came to pass about this time, that he went  
into the house to do his work; and there was none of the  
men of the house there within. And she caught him by his  
garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in  
her hand, and fled, and got him out. And it came to pass,  
when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and  
was fled forth, that she called unto the men of her house,  
and spake  
</span>

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in a Hebrew unto us  
to mock us: he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried  
with a loud voice: and it came to pass, when he heard that  
I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by  
me, and fled, and got him out. And she laid up his garment  
by her, until his master came home. And she spake unto him  
according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, whom  
thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me: and  
it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he  
left his garment by me, and fled out.  
And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his  
wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner  
did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled. And  
Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, the  
place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was  
there in the prison. But Jehovah was with Joseph, and  
showed kindness unto him, and gave him favor in the sight  
of the keeper of the prison. And the keeper of the prison  
committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in  
the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer  
of it. The keeper of the prison looked not to anything that  
was under his hand, because Jehovah was with him; and that  
which he did, Jehovah made it to prosper.

The imagination is liable to get into trouble because it is so little
understood. The sense consciousness of the animal soul (Potiphar's wife)
tempts us through the imagination to gratify its sense desires. When we
refuse it expression there is a reaction, and we seem for a time to be
imprisoned or limited in making progress. But if we patiently bide our
time, knowing that only good can come to us, the seemingly imprisoned
faculty (Joseph) will prove its God-given

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

power. Although physically imprisoned, Joseph (the imagination)
expresses himself spiritually, for the Lord (law) is with him, and in
due time he will come into his rightful place as one of the important
faculties in the consciousness. (Jehovah, the law, was with Joseph.)

By faithfully performing the routine duties intrusted to one, even in a
prison, one is certain to be advanced to a better and more remunerative
position. However faithfulness has an even greater reward than this, for
all the while the faithful one is building a firmer, truer, and more
Godlike character in himself, which is an enduring recompense; for thus
he enters into the possession of the true riches, the spiritual
consciousness. Joseph was made the overseer of all the prisoners and
later was released and given the highest position in the land as prime
minister or adviser to Pharaoh.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 40:1-23. And it came to pass after these
things, that  
the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended  
their lord the king of Egypt. And Pharaoh was wroth against  
his two officers, against the chief of the butlers, and  
against the chief of the bakers. And he put them in ward in  
the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the  
place where Joseph was bound. And the captain of the guard  
charged Joseph with them, and he ministered unto them: and  
they continued a season in ward. And they dreamed a dream  
both of them, each man his dream, in one night, each man  
according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler  
and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the  
prison. And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and  
saw them, and, behold, they were sad. And he asked  
Pharaoh's officers that were with  
</span>

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

him in ward in his master's house, saying, Wherefore look  
ye so sad today? And they said unto him, We have dreamed a  
dream, and there is none that can interpret it. And Joseph  
said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell  
it me, I pray you.  
And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to  
him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; and in the  
vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded,  
and its blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof  
brought forth ripe grapes: and Pharaoh's cup was in my  
hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into  
Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand. And  
Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: the  
three branches are three days; within yet three days shall  
Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee unto thine  
office: and thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand,  
after the former manner when thou wast his butler. But have  
me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee, and  
show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me  
unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house: for indeed I  
was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here  
also have I done nothing that they should put me into the  
dungeon.  
When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good,  
he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold,  
three baskets of white bread were on my head: and in the  
uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for  
Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon  
my head. And Joseph answered and said, This is the  
interpretation thereof: the three baskets are three days;  
within yet three days shall Pharaoh life up thy head from  
off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds  
shall eat thy flesh from off thee. And it came to pass the  
third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a  
feast unto all his servants:  

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head  
of the chief baker among his servants. And he restored the  
chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup  
into Pharaoh's hand: but he hanged the chief baker: as  
Joseph had interpreted to them. Yet did not the chief  
butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.  

</div>

The chief butler and the chief baker were also in prison (the
subconsciousness). This shows how we put the Spirit of life (the
butler's wine) and of substance (the baker's bread) in bondage to or
under the dominion of the sense man. By this time Joseph had become the
warden in charge of all the prisoners, so that life and substance were
under his control. When imagination controls these it exercises a
powerful influence in the subconsciousness, bringing into manifestation
many things that are so foreign and strange to us that they seem to come
from without.

Joseph's interpretation of the dreams and the coming to pass of events
exactly as he had predicted them gave him prestige as an interpreter of
dreams and later brought him to the attention of the king.

What is the significance of dreams? The time of dreaming is either when
we are losing consciousness in the process of going to sleep or when we
are regaining it during awakening. When we are in deep sleep we live in
the subconsciousness, a life of which the conscious mind knows nothing.
This mind catches glimpses of it when we are making the transition from
one state to the other. However we are in close touch with the
superconscious, the mind of Spirit, when we are in the borderland state
between sleeping and waking. At such times one who is spiritual-minded
and

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

who at all times seeks to know what infinite wisdom has to reveal,
receives his message. Spirit speaks in symbols such as the butler's cup
of wine and the baker's loaf of bread, and the trained faculty of
imagination (Joseph) interprets the symbols to the conscious mind.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 41:1-44. And it came to pass at the end of two
full  
years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the  
river. And, behold, there came up out of the river seven  
kine, well-favored and fat-fleshed: and they fed in the  
reed-grass. And, behold, seven other kine came up after  
them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed, and  
stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river. And  
the ill-favored and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven  
well-favored and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. And he slept  
and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven ears of grain  
came up upon one stalk, rank and good. And, behold, seven  
ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprang up after  
them. And the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and  
full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.  
And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was  
troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of  
Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them  
his dream; but there was none that could interpret them  
unto Pharaoh.  
Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do  
remember my faults this day: Pharaoh was wroth with his  
servants, and put me in ward in the house of the captain of  
the guard, me and the chief baker: and we dreamed a dream  
in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to  
the interpretation of his dream. And there was with us  
there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the  
guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our  
dreams; to each man according to his dream he did  
interpret. And it came to pass, as he interpreted  
</span>

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him  
he hanged.  
Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him  
hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and  
changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. And Pharaoh  
said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none  
that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that  
when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it. And  
Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will  
give Pharaoh an answer of peace. And Pharaoh spake unto  
Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of the  
river: and, behold, there came up out of the river seven  
kine, fat-fleshed and well-favored; and they fed in the  
reed-grass: and, behold, seven other kine came up after  
them, poor and very ill-favored and lean-fleshed, such as I  
never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness: and the  
lean and ill-favored kine did eat up the first seven fat  
kine: and when they had eaten them up, it could not be  
known that they had eaten them; but they were still  
ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke. And I saw in  
my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up upon one stalk,  
full and good: and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and  
blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: and the  
thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears: and I told it  
unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare  
it to me.  
And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one:  
what God is about to do he hath declared unto Pharaoh. The  
seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears  
are seven years: the dream is one. And the seven lean and  
ill-favored kine that came up after them are seven years,  
and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind;  
they shall be seven years of famine. That is the thing  
which I spake unto Pharaoh: what God is about to do he hath  
showed unto Pharaoh. Behold, there  

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of  
Egypt: and there shall arise after them seven years of  
famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land  
of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; and the  
plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that  
famine which followeth; for it shall be very grievous. And  
for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh, it is because  
the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring  
it to pass. Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man  
discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. Let  
Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the  
land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in  
the seven plenteous years. And let them gather all the food  
of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the  
hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep  
it. And the food shall be for a store to the land against  
the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of  
Egypt; and the land perish not through the famine.  
And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the  
eyes of all his servants. And Pharaoh said unto his  
servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom the  
spirit of God is? And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch  
as God hath showed thee all this, there is none so discreet  
and wise as thou: thou shalt be over my house, and  
according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only  
in the throne will I be greater than thou. And Pharaoh said  
unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of  
Egypt. And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand,  
and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in ventures  
of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; and he  
made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and  
they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he set him over  
all the land of Egypt. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am  
Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift  

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.  

</div>

When a person has developed the Joseph state of consciousness and can
give vivid form of his ideas by using his imaginative faculty, he does
not take his dreams or visions in a literal sense. He rather unclothes
the dream of its form by using the same power that he has of clothing
ideas with form. Then he clearly sees the idea hidden behind the forms
and symbols of his dream. He knows that all forms represent ideas and is
able to resolve the form back into the primal idea of Divine Mind. Thus
he is taught by Spirit more directly than is the ordinary individual.
Spiritual Truth comes to him directly through an always open channel.

One of the surest proofs that you have opened yourself to Spirit is that
you have symbolical dreams and can spiritually interpret them. Divine
ideas are imaged in your placid soul like shadows on a quiet pool. You
see them mentally and you may catch their import if you meditate
patiently and persistently on the relation that each image or symbol
bears to thought. Things are first ideas, then thoughts reduced in
radiation to the plane of sense perception. When you still the senses
you will begin to perceive the thoughts that are back of things. This
may be a slow way, but it is a sure way to learn the language of mind,
and in time it will enable you to translate all the shapes and forms you
see on any plane of consciousness, into their corresponding thoughts.
When this is accomplished you have become a Joseph and stand next to
Jesus.

Joseph correctly interpreted the dreams of Pharaoh that later came to
pass. The name Pharaoh means "the sun," "the king"; he is the king of
the subconscious

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

realm whose throne is located in the solar plexus. This brain of the
body, plays an important role in directing the circulation, the
digestion and assimilation of food, and so forth. Students of mind have
discovered that the solar plexus is but the organ through which the
ruling ego, Pharaoh, acts.

The signet ring that Pharaoh placed upon Joseph's hand represents
authority, and the fine raiment with which he clothed Joseph symbolizes
approval; that is, the ruling power of the body gives to the imagination
authority and approval in both the within and the without.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 41:45-57. And Pharaoh called Joseph's name  
Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath, the  
daughter of Potiphera priest of On. And Joseph went out  
over the land of Egypt.  
And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before  
Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the  
presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of  
Egypt. And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought  
forth by handfuls. And he gathered up all the food of the  
seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up  
the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was  
round about every city, he up in the same. And Joseph laid  
up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left  
off numbering; for it was without number. And unto Joseph  
were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom  
Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, bare unto  
him. And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh:  
For, said he, God hath made me forget all my toil, and all  
my father's house. And the name of the second called he  
Ephraim: For God hath made me fruitful in the land of my  
affliction. And the seven years of plenty, that was in the  
land of Egypt,  
</span>

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

came to an end. And the seven years of famine began to  
come, according as Joseph had said: and there was famine in  
all the lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was  
bread. And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the  
people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto  
all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you,  
do. And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and  
Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the  
Egyptians; and the famine was sore in the land of Egypt.  
And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy grain,  
because the famine was sore in all the earth.  

</div>

In lower Egypt during the time of Joseph was the city of On, one of the
world's oldest cities. Here was located one of the great temples of
Egypt, whose high priest was Potiphera. The daughter of the high priest
was Asenath, who became Joseph's wife.

Asenath represents the feminine or love side of the natural man. Two
sons were born of this union, Manasseh (understanding) and Ephraim
(will), and they inherited Joseph's allotment in the Promised Land
(regenerated perfect body). Understanding and will are dominant forces
in the race because they are necessary in the development of the soul.
If the imagination (Joseph) were wholly free (unmarried or without
responsibility), it would indulge in daydreams and fanciful schemes that
could not be worked out in a practical world governed by inexorable law.
If in this dreamy state the mind is given a definite thought of Truth
(such as monotheism, taught at the school of On) and is joined with the
natural soul (Asenath), it brings forth the two stabilizing mental
qualities will and understanding, symbolized by Joseph's sons

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

Ephraim and Manasseh.

The name Manasseh means "who makes to forget." Manasseh was the first
son born to Joseph, who had a great deal to forget. Joseph needed to
forget the wrong done him by his brothers, the temptation of Potiphar's
wife, and the error of long imprisonment. Thus Manasseh represents the
understanding of how to use one's ability to forget or deny that which
is no longer profitable to the man.

The name Ephraim means "very fruitful." Ephraim represents the ability
of man to add to his consciousness through the action of his will
whatever he may choose to affirm and to become fruitful in his thoughts
even in the land of affliction.

The first step for the beginner in Truth is to set up a new and better
state of consciousness based on the absolute. He must develop the
Manasseh quality of forgetting the not-good by denial and the Ephraim
quality of increasing the good by affirming it to be the real. The
understanding and the will must be especially active in one who would
overcome and master the sensations of the body, which is one of the
first steps in its regeneration.

Joseph was thirty years old when he began his great work in Egypt. At
about that age a man completes a natural cycle in the evolution of his
soul and is ready for an adventure into the spiritual. When the
spiritually awakening man has reached this stage of development there is
an increase of energy throughout the body. As we have previously noted,
the imagination is the "increasing faculty" as well as the formative
faculty. The Hebrew meaning of the name Joseph is "Jehovah shall
increase." The great increase

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

that comes at this period in his unfoldment lasts about seven years, or
passes through seven stages of activity, symbolized in Pharaoh's dream
by the seven fat kine and the seven full ears of corn.

Those who are wise will conserve this energy in the storehouse of
subconsciousness, because there is certain to be a reaction
proportionate to action. The law holds good for every form of energy.
When this generated force is properly conserved, the reaction is not
felt. When we exalt the Joseph state of consciousness (as did Pharaoh)
and let it rule in our body, Spirit will show us how to handle the
situation. Then we shall make storage batteries of our "cities," which
are the ganglionic centers of the body (Egypt). When Pharaoh gave Joseph
the power and authority to do this conserving work, he changed his name
to Zaphenathpaneah, a compound word meaning "savior of the universe,"
"sustainer of the life of the world," "governor of the district or place
of stored-up life." This would clearly indicate that the body should be
ruled over by the spiritualized imaginative faculty working under the
direction and by the power of Spirit.

The word famine implies extreme scarcity of food, reducing people to an
extremity of hunger, of starvation. Here Egypt (the subconsciousness),
the storehouse of plenty, is the source from which all the surrounding
countries (states of consciousness) come for sustenance when the outer
man has exhausted his resources.

The seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine show that
the unregenerate man lives in a consciousness of duality, seeing good
and evil, heat and cold, plenty and poverty, feast and famine; the
spiritualized

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

imagination (Joseph) sees the whole of life as one. He sees no lack but
recognizes a coming consciousness of lack and relates it to the present
consciousness of plenty, and by this unifying work he lays up a store of
substance for future use. The imagination should rank high among all the
faculties of man, for without its magic touch life would become flat,
stale, and meaningless; but once imagination is awakened, man is filled
with health, life, substance, and abundance.
