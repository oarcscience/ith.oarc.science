###  Chapter VIII The Mental Supplants the Physical Genesis 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28 

IT IS SELF-EVIDENT that both the physical and metaphysical sides of life
are capable of manifold expression. Some metaphysicians contend that all
is mind and matter is the negative of mind or nothingness. However,
contemplation of the tremendous possibilities infolded in the earth
makes us pause when we hear that assertion. Here beneath our feet is a
crust of substance upon whose pages like a mighty book is written a
record of the earth's evolution during the aeons and ages through which
it has passed from mist to matter. In it the geologist finds the fossils
that tell him of its physical history, and the trained psychic can hold
in his hand a piece of inanimate rock and it will tell him its evolution
from ether to matter. The souls of all forms from mollusk up to man have
left a certain memory essence upon the substance they handled, and that
essence is preserved ready to be redeemed and raised to higher levels by
the minds that gave it form. Although the body of

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Imperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay  
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away,"  
</span>

</div>

its soul essence endures and will in the final judgment, or
justification, of man's work be merged into the perfect body. Daniel
pointed to this when he wrote, "Many of them that sleep in the dust of
the earth shall awake."

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

The purchase by Abraham of the cave of Machpelah as a grave for Sarah
involves this mystical soul essence. Machpelah means infolded, winding,
spiral, symbolizing a condition in which great possibilities of
expression are involved. Not only Sarah but Abraham himself, Isaac,
Rebekah, Leah, and Jacob were buried there. All these were spiritually
quickened and therefore impressed their soul qualities upon matter more
definitely than the children of Heth; but all are to undergo judgment,
through numerous incarnations, at the end of the ages, "some to
everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt." "And they
that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they
that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 23:1-2. And the life of Sarah was a hundred and
seven  
and twenty years: these were the years of the life of  
Sarah. And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron),  
in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah,  
and to weep for her.  
</span>

</div>

The name Kiriath-arba means "city of Arba," "city foursquare."
Symbolically Kiriath-arba denotes the state of consciousness that
attributes to material reason the perfection belonging to and coming
from spiritual understanding only; that attributes strength, power,
knowledge, and greatness to the outer formed world instead of knowing
that all power and reality exists in Spirit, in the unformed ideas of
the one Mind.

Sarah (symbolizing the spiritual soul in a certain degree of unfoldment)
died in Kiriath-arba. In truth however the higher activities of the soul
cannot die. It may seemingly become entangled in thoughts on

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

the natural plane and disappear for a season from the conscious mind.
However it is enjoying a period of rest in preparation for a new and
higher expression.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 23:3-20. And Abraham rose up from before his
dead, and  
spake unto the children of Heth, saying, I am a stranger  
and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a  
burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my  
sight. And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying  
unto him, Hear us, my lord; thou art a prince of God among  
us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of  
us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou  
mayest bury thy dead. And Abraham rose up, and bowed  
himself to the people of the land, even to the children of  
Heth. And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind  
that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and  
entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, that he may give  
me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the  
end of his field; for the full price let him give it to me  
in the midst of you for a possession of a burying-place.  
Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of  
Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the  
audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in  
at the gate of his city, saying, Nay, my lord, hear me: the  
field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it  
thee; in the presence of the children of my people give I  
it thee: bury thy dead. And Abraham bowed himself down  
before the people of the land. And he spake unto Ephron in  
the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou  
wilt, I pray thee, hear me: I will give the price of the  
field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there. And  
Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, My lord, hearken  
unto me: a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of  
silver, what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore my  
dead. And  
</span>

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to  
Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the  
children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current  
money with the merchant.  
So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was  
before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein,  
and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all  
the border thereof round about, were made sure unto Abraham  
for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth,  
before all that went in at the gate of the city. And after  
this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the  
field of Machpelah before Mamre (the same is Hebron), in  
the land of Canaan. And the field, and the cave that is  
therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a  
burying-place by the children of Heth.  

</div>

Abraham requested the children of Heth to "entreat for me to Ephron the
son of Zohar" that he might give him the cave of Machpelah for a burying
place for Sarah.

The name Zohar means "whiteness," "brightness," "nobility." Zohar
represents thoughts of a pure, clear, lofty, discriminating character.

The name Ephron means "gazellelike," "quick," "volatile." Ephron
represents a type of thought that is very impulsive, light, airy, and
quick to change.

The name Machpelah means "equally divided," "twofold," "spiral form."
Machpelah represents subconscious body substance (a field in which there
was a cave). Sarah and the others buried in this cave symbolize the
submergence of spiritual ideals in us. When these ideals have done their
work in the conscious realm of our mind, for the time being they give

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

way to other activities of the mind, while they sink back into the
subconsciousness (cave). There they take deep root in substance and
continue their work, which is not apparent to the outer, conscious,
thinking part of the mind. They work out into the body consciousness in
another incarnation, thus aiding in raising the whole organism to a
higher plane of expression.

When going through the inner experience of releasing from consciousness
some much-cherished soul quality or thought activity that has become
useless for the time being, one may have a tendency to grieve and to
hold to the good that seems to be becoming inactive in one's life. Then
the thought activity represented by Ephron comes to one's rescue to aid
one in making the necessary change and in letting go of the old. Sarah
died in Hebron, and it was in Hebron that Abraham bargained with Ephron
for the cave of Machpelah in which to bury Sarah. Hebron refers to the
conscious mind; also to a certain "association" of thoughts. Faith
(Abraham) suggests the awakening of man's mind to higher ideals, and
hills denote their manifestation.

The word Mamre means "firmness," "vigor," "strength." The oak trees
(which surrounded Mamre) in themselves denote strength and protection;
but the Hebrew name for oak trees has a deeper significance than this;
it comes from a root similar to the one from which is derived the word
Elohim. Thus we are reminded of the truth that those who trust in God as
their defense, their refuge, and their fortress, and who dwell in the
secret place of the Most High, abide under the shadow of the Almighty,
and not only are kept from all evil and its results but also continue

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

to grow and unfold in understanding, in spirituality, in every good. The
Hebrew words ayil, elon, and allah all refer to the oak or terebinth,
and express the ideas of power, elevation, and expansion. The prefix al
or el that begins the name Elohim, or better AElohim, comes from the
same root, which refers to the power of expansive movement, the power of
extension, and is also the personal pronoun el, which stands for the
strong one or the absolute.

Abraham's insistence on paying Ephron for the ground where Sarah was to
be buried emphasizes the sufficiency of Spirit and the opulence of those
who live under its law. Abraham was the possessor of an all-producing
faith, and he was expected to use it on all occasions to supply his
every need. Those who have a living faith in God's all-sufficiency do
not beg or accept things without recompense but give value received for
everything.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 24:1-9. And Abraham was old, and well stricken
in age:  
and Jehovah had blessed Abraham in all things. And Abraham  
said unto his servant, the elder of his house, that ruled  
over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my  
thigh: and I will make thee swear by Jehovah, the God of  
heaven and the God of the earth, that thou wilt not take a  
wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among  
whom I dwell: but thou shalt go unto my country, and to my  
kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac. And the servant  
said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing  
to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son  
again unto the land from whence thou camest? And Abraham  
said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son  
thither again. Jehovah, the God of heaven, who took me from  
my father's house, and  
</span>

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

from the land of my nativity, and who spake unto me, and  
who sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this  
land; he will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt  
take a wife for my son from thence. And if the woman be not  
willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this  
my oath; only thou shalt not bring my son thither again.  
And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his  
master, and sware to him concerning this matter.  

</div>

The progenitor of the house of Abraham (primitive faith) is Spirit.
Abraham desired to perpetuate the spiritual trend of consciousness. The
"servant, the elder of his house, that ruled over all that he had"
(representing the personal ego that rules over the body or "house"
consciousness), obeyed every injunction of his. Abraham (the progressive
mind) desires Isaac (his happy, joyous thoughts) to unite in marriage
with one of his kindred (Rebekah: high ideals) in the land of Haran
(exalted state of mind). Abraham (progressive faith) then requires his
obedient servant (the personal ego ruling over the body consciousness)
to take an oath or affirm, with his hand (power) on Abraham's thigh,
that this shall be accomplished.

Yarek, the Hebrew word translated "thigh," comes from a little used root
and is sometimes used euphemistically to designate the genitals. This
oath was not taken on the thigh but on the genital organs, a practice
not peculiar to the Hebrews but known to many other primitive people.
Such a custom hints at phallicism or the worship of the physical source
of life. As our courts impress on the witness the sacredness of his oath
by having him place his hand on the Bible while making it, so these
people used the source of physical life to enforce the sanctity of an
oath.

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

Spiritual light comes through the activity of pioneering faith. Abraham
realized that through his struggles for a higher state of consciousness
(Haran) his soul had become rooted and grounded in the fundamental
principles of Truth. Therefore he desired his happy, joyous thoughts
(Isaac) to unite with a feminine soul force that had sprung from the
original root of Spirit (his own kindred).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 24:10-62. And the servant took ten camels, of
the  
camels of his master, and departed, having all goodly  
things of his master's in his hand: and he arose, and went  
to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor. And he made the  
camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water  
at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw  
water. And he said, O Jehovah, the God of my master  
Abraham, send me, I pray thee, good speed this day, and  
show kindness unto my master Abraham. Behold, I am standing  
by the fountain of water; and the daughters of the men of  
the city are coming out to draw water: and let it come to  
pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy  
pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say,  
Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same  
be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and  
thereby shall I know that thou hast showed kindness unto my  
master. And it came to pass, before he had done speaking,  
that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel,  
the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother,  
with her pitcher upon her shoulder. And the damsel was very  
fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her:  
and she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher,  
and came up. And the servant ran to meet her, and said,  
Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water from thy  
pitcher. And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and  
let down her pitcher upon her hand,  
</span>

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

and gave him drink. And when she had done giving him drink,  
she said, I will draw for thy camels also, until they have  
done drinking. And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into  
the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and drew  
for all his camels. And the man looked stedfastly on her,  
holding his peace, to know whether Jehovah had made his  
journey prosperous or not. And it came to pass, as the  
camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ring  
of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of  
ten shekels weight of gold, and said, Whose daughter art  
thou? tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in thy father's  
house for us to lodge in? And she said unto him, I am the  
daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bare unto  
Nahor. She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and  
provender enough, and room to lodge in. And the man bowed  
his head, and worshipped Jehovah. And he said, Blessed be  
Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who hath not  
forsaken his loving-kindness and his truth toward my  
master: as for me, Jehovah hath led me in the way to the  
house of my master's brethren.  
And the damsel ran, and told her mother's house according  
to these words. And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was  
Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the fountain.  
And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the  
bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the  
words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man  
unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he was  
standing by the camels at the fountain. And he said, Come  
in, thou blessed of Jehovah; wherefore standest thou  
without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the  
camels. And the man came into the house, and he ungirded  
the camels; and he gave straw and provender for the camels,  
and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men that  
were with him. And there was set food before him to  

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine  
errand. And he said, Speak on. And he said, I am Abraham's  
servant. And Jehovah hath blessed my master greatly; and he  
is become great; and he hath given him flocks and herds,  
and silver and gold, and men-servants and maid-servants,  
and camels and asses. And Sarah my master's wife bare a son  
to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given  
all that he hath. And my master made me swear, saying, Thou  
shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the  
Canaanites, in whose land I dwell: but thou shalt go unto  
my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for  
my son. And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman  
will not follow me. And he said unto me, Jehovah, before  
whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy  
way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred,  
and of my father's house: then shalt thou be clear from my  
oath, when thou comest to thy kindred; and if they give her  
not to thee, thou shalt be clear from my oath. And I came  
this day unto the fountain, and said, O Jehovah, the God of  
my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I  
go: behold, I am standing by the fountain of water; and let  
it come to pass, that the maiden that cometh forth to draw,  
to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water  
from thy pitcher to drink; and she shall say to me, Both  
drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the  
same be the woman whom Jehovah hath appointed for my  
master's son. And before I had done speaking in my heart,  
behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her  
shoulder; and she went down unto the fountain, and drew:  
and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee. And she  
made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and  
said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I  
drank, and she made the camels drink also. And I asked her,  
and said, Whose daughter art  

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son,  
whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the ring upon her  
nose, and the bracelets upon her hands. And I bowed my  
head, and worshipped Jehovah, and blessed Jehovah, the God  
of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to  
take my master's brother's daughter for his son. And now if  
ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and  
if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to  
the left.  
Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing  
proceedeth from Jehovah: we cannot speak unto thee bad or  
good. Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and  
let her be thy master's son's wife, as Jehovah hath spoken.  
And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard  
their words, he bowed himself down to the earth unto  
Jehovah. And the servant brought forth jewels of silver,  
and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah:  
he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious  
things. And they did eat and drink, he and the men that  
were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in  
the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master. And  
her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with  
us a few days, at least ten; after that she shall go. And  
he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing Jehovah hath  
prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.  
And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her  
mouth. And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt  
thou go with this man? And she said, I will go. And they  
sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and  
Abraham's servant, and his men. And they blessed Rebekah,  
and said unto her, Our sister, be thou the mother of  
thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed possess the  
gate of those that hate them.  
And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the  
camels, and followed the man: and  

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

the servant took Rebekah, and went his way. And Isaac came  
up from the way of Beer-lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the land  
of the South.  

</div>

A declaration of Truth is always demonstrated in mind and body. Paul
says the man is not without the woman in the Lord. In the above
Scripture the law is in process of being fulfilled (the oath or
affirmation made by Abraham's servant is here being demonstrated.

Abraham's servant journeyed into the land of Mesopotamia in search of a
wife for Abraham's son Isaac and was led by Jehovah to the city of
Nahor, where he found Rebekah.

The state of consciousness represented by Mesopotamia lies close to the
spiritual, at least close enough to be open to the divine urge for light
and higher attainment ("country between," "middle region," "middle
land"). Otherwise it could not have been the home of Rebekah and her
brother Laban, nor of Abraham at the time when he received from God the
revelation directing him to come out from his people into another
country (to enter into a higher and more spiritual state of mind) that
he might possess his divine inheritance.

Nahor denotes the arousing of a more lofty desire in man through the
activity of faith (Abraham). These greater aspirations pierce the
darkness of materiality and aid in bringing about a new trend of thought
("eager," "piercing," "slaying").

Bethuel, father of Rebekah, represents conscious unity with Spirit.
Milcah, mother of Rebekah, represents wisdom and good judgment through
the intuitional or feminine nature.

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

The name Rebekah means "tying firmly," "noosed cord," "beauty that
ensnares." Rebekah represents the soul's natural delight in beauty. This
essence of the soul is continually going forth and making contact with
the harmonious and the beautiful.

Abraham's servant adorned Rebekah with rings and bracelets of gold,
which appealed to her love of the beautiful. This no doubt influenced
her in her decision to make the journey to the house of Abraham.
Metaphysically Rebekah's taking this step represents an esthetic
feminine force within the soul penetrating down into the subconscious
and there making union with life and substance. The servant (personal
ego) guided Rebekah into Beer-lahai-roi, in the "land of the South" (the
subconscious), where Isaac dwelt.

(For further interpretation of Beer-lahai-roi see comments on Gen.
16:1-15.)

Through the inherent love of the harmonious thousands are blessed and
many hearts of "hate" are directed into other channels of expression
("let thy seed possess the gate of those that hate them").

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 24:63-67. And Isaac went out to meditate in the
field  
at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and,  
behold, there were camels coming. And Rebekah lifted up her  
eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel.  
And she said unto the servant, What man is this that  
walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It  
is my master: and she took her veil, and covered herself.  
And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.  
And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and  
took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her:  
and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.  
</span>

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

</div>

The happy Isaac consciousness claimed its counterpart in Rebekah. Faith
and obedience (Abraham) bring forth joy, and joy (Isaac) is linked with
the beauty of nature without. The devout, joyous soul readily makes
union with the natural, harmonious expression of Spirit, and in the joy
of spiritual realization the thoughts are lifted up in exaltation and
praise. "And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide:
and he lifted up his eyes, and saw . . . And Rebekah lifted up her eyes
. . . and he loved her." Thus is portrayed the union of the devout,
joyous nature with the soul of love.

The joyous soul, when established in spiritual faith and poise, is
screened from contact with inharmonies: "and she took her veil, and
covered herself."

Isaac led Rebekah into his mother Sarah's tent. This signifies that the
soul powers symbolized by Isaac and Rebekah are ever penetrating into
the physical, here represented by the tent.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 25:1-4. And Abraham took another wife, and her
name  
was Keturah. And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and  
Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. And Jokshan begat  
Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and  
Letushim, and Leummim. And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and  
Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were  
the children of Keturah.  
</span>

</div>

The name of Abraham's second wife, Keturah, means "incense," "perfume,"
"aloeswood." Keturah represents a soul consciousness that aspires to
higher things even though still in sense.

To Abraham Keturah bare six sons. Zimran represents a positive
expression of joy, harmony, and

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

grace, the first conscious result of a union in the individual of
awakening faith (Abraham) with the aspiration of the soul for higher
bodily attainment (Keturah). Jokshan represents a sly, treacherous,
deceitful tendency that often exists in the sense mind of man and that
places the individual who gives way to it in difficult situations. Medan
and Midian represent the sense of dominion that to a degree is founded
on discrimination and understanding but that is still full of contention
and strife. Ishbak typifies the transitoriness of human ambition and its
results. Shuah denotes an exceedingly depressed, downcast state of
thought.

The meaning of the names of the six sons of Abraham and Keturah point to
divided thought; the thoughts are partly good thoughts and partly
limited thoughts, thoughts of the sense mind. The descendants of these
sons became enemies of the Israelites. While the trend of thought
represented by them may to a certain extent be helpful to the natural
man at a certain stage of his unfoldment, the time comes when they must
be released from the mind so that the real, true thoughts and activities
(Israelites) may have full sway in the consciousness.

Jokshan begat Sheba, who represents wholeness or fullness on various
planes of existence ("return to an original state," "repose,"
"equilibrium"), and Dedan ("mutual attraction," "physical love," "low"),
who represents a phase of physical or animal attraction and affection.
This must give way to true love, which is spiritual in its character and
is unselfish and pure.

Dedan had three sons. Asshurim represents the reasoning power of faith
operating in sense consciousness. The reasoning of the intellect, guided
by the

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

senses, may seem almost invincible at times, but it does not endure.
Only spiritual ideas and their manifestation are truly strong, powerful,
and abiding. The second son of Dedan was Letushim, who represents the
sense of being oppressed and hard driven that all persons in the lower,
earthly consciousness experience much of the time. In the Letushim
consciousness advancement is slow and is gained by means of hard
experiences. The third son of Dedan was Leummim, who symbolizes great
increase and multiplication of thoughts in consciousness but without
real spiritual quickening.

Midian had five sons. Ephah represents darkened and obscured phases of
thought and soul in which the Spirit of God is working--over which
Spirit is brooding--that Truth may blossom forth and come to fruition in
due time. Midian's second son was Epher, who represents thoughts on the
animal plane of consciousness in man that are active but young and
inexperienced. His third son was Hanoch, who represents entrance into a
higher consciousness than has been known and experienced before. The
fourth son, Abida, represents the belief that knowledge comes through
the senses. The judgment of the senses, based on outer appearances,
produces discordant thoughts, jealousies, and the like. Midian's fifth
son Eldaah ("whom God has called"), represents a central thought that
responds in a measure to the quickening presence of Spirit although it
belongs to the sense phase of man consciousness. It perceives that God
is the source of understanding, yet it does not bring forth definite
fruit in consciousness.

<span class="small">Gen. 25:5-6. And Abraham gave all that he had unto
Isaac.  
But unto the sons of the concubines, that Abraham had,

</span>

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward,  
unto the east country.  

</div>

Isaac was the product of Abraham's spiritual consciousness, while the
sons of the concubines were the product of his personal consciousness.
Hence Isaac (meaning divine sonship) was the rightful heir to all that
Abraham had.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 25:7-11. And these are the days of the years
of  
Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred three-score and  
fifteen. And Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good  
old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to  
his people. And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in  
the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of  
Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; the field which  
Abraham purchased of the children of Heth: there was  
Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. And it came to pass  
after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son;  
and Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi.  
</span>

</div>

Machpelah was a field "before Mamre" that Abraham bought from Ephron, of
the children of Heth. Machpelah represents the subconscious body
substance. As in the case of Sarah, when the aggregation of thoughts
symbolized by Abraham has done its perfect work in the conscious realm
of mind, it gives way for the time being to other activities of the mind
and sinks back into the subconsciousness. (See comments on Gen.
23:3-20.)

The name Mamre means "firmness," "vigor," "strength." The lesson here is
that faith in God (suggested by Abraham) brings about the right relation
among all the faculties, establishing firmness, vigor, and strength.

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

After Abraham's passing God blessed Isaac, and he dwelt in
Beer-lahai-roi by the well of the same name. The name Beer-lahai-roi
means "the well of the living one." Isaac symbolizes divine sonship.
When the individual realizes that life is omnipresent and eternal and
that Spirit is its source he has laid the foundation for its
manifestation throughout his whole being.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 25:12-18. Now these are the generations of
Ishmael,  
Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid,  
bare unto Abraham: and these are the names of the sons of  
Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations:  
the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel,  
and Mibsam, and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, Hadad, and  
Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: these are the sons of  
Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and  
by their encampments; twelve princes according to their  
nations. And these are the years of the life of Ishmael a  
hundred and thirty seven years: and he gave up the ghost  
and died, and was gathered unto his people. And they dwelt  
from Havilah unto Shur that is before Egypt, as thou goest  
toward Assyria: he abode over against all his brethren.  
</span>

</div>

The first-born of Ishmael was Nebaioth. Nebaioth represents the outer,
sensate, or material consciousness, reflecting the light of the inner,
true ideas that are born of Spirit ("heights"), and realizing the
possibility of bringing forth abundant good ("cultivation of the soil,"
"fruitfulness," "germinations") through the power of the word of
understanding ("prophetic utterances," "inspired words").

The second son of Ishmael was Kedar. Kedar represents a confused,
unsettled, disturbed, obscure thought

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

yet one with a degree of power that belongs to the outer or sense side
of consciousness.

The third son of Ishmael was Adbeel. Adbeel represents a yearning of the
soul for something higher and better. This yearning will bring forth
fruit in time, when it has been subjected to the necessary education and
training. Though not always recognized as coming from God, this
discipline is brought about by the working of the divine law.

The fourth son, Mibsam, represents a perception or sensing, to a degree,
of the joys and beauties of Spirit: the power to perceive, discriminate,
detect, estimate.

The fifth son, Mishma, represents a receptive, attentive, obedient
attitude in the outer or sense consciousness.

The sixth son, Dumah, represents the condition that man calls death;
also the state of man wherein he is dead through his trespasses and
sins.

The seventh son, Massa, represents the ushering in of a new thought
regarding that in man which has hitherto been deemed by him to be wholly
material and so doomed to death and dissolution. This new thought is a
prophecy that the seemingly physical body will ultimately be lifted up
and saved alive. Massa represents a type of thought that lays hold of,
retains, and transports this truth ("divine declaration," "a lifting
up,") into the outer organism, the seemingly mortal part of the
individual.

Ishmael's eighth son was Hadad. Hadad symbolizes the setting up as
all-powerful of the intellect in its spiritually unawakened state. Back
of the intellect however, back of every expression of intelligence or
understanding,

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

there exists the hidden principle of all light, all wisdom, all
knowledge: God, Spirit.

The ninth son, Tema, represents abundant substance and life, firmness,
faithfulness, and Truth stored in the subconsciousness.

The tenth son, Jetur, represents an idea of order, solidity, strength,
that which keeps within bounds; the idea or belief that the individual
can be kept in orderly existence only when limited to certain lines of
thought and action, only when his thoughts, beliefs, and acts are fenced
in. The sense man's way of making the individual better is always to
limit him by means of outer rules and regulations; it knows nothing of
true spiritual freedom and guidance, which alone can bring about real
strength, unity, and adjustment in consciousness.

The eleventh son, Naphish, symbolizes the activity of the very breath of
life by which every living creature is animated and inspired,
consciously or unconsciously.

The twelfth son, Kedemah, represents the inner or true being of man,
divine principle; that which exists from everlasting to everlasting,
man's true spiritual or Christ self.

Ishmael represents the thoughts that are the fruit of the personal or
carnal in man. Kedemah, the youngest of his twelve sons, symbolizes the
individual's turning within to his inner or true being, which is
spiritual, eternal. This makes us think of Paul's words in I Corinthians
15:46, 47: "Howbeit that is not first which is spiritual, but that which
is natural; then that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth,
earthy: the second man is of heaven." God, Spirit, and

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

the Christ, who is man's true inner self, are first; otherwise the outer
man could not be. In outer expression and manifestation however the
physical man appears to come first, and he seems to run the full gamut
of experience in the outer consciousness before he finally turns about
and begins to seek within his own inner being to find God, Spirit, his
true source and sustenance.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 25:19-22. And these are the generations of
Isaac,  
Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac: and Isaac was forty  
years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the  
Syrian of Paddanaram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be  
his wife. And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because  
she was barren: and Jehovah was entreated of him, and  
Rebekah his wife conceived. And the children struggled  
together within her; and she said, If it be so, wherefore  
do I live? And she went to inquire of Jehovah.  
</span>

</div>

When Isaac (representing serenity, peace, joy) was forty years old he
took Rebekah to be his wife. Rebekah symbolizes the soul's natural
delight in beauty. She was the daughter of Bethuel, who symbolizes unity
with God, a conscious abiding in Him, and the sister of Laban, who
symbolizes an exalted state of mind.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 25:23-28. And Jehovah said unto her,  
Two nations are in thy womb,  
And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels:  
And the one people shall be stronger than the other people;  
And the elder shall serve the younger.  
And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold,  
there were twins in her womb. And the first came forth red,  
all over like a hairy garment; and she called his name  
Esau. And after that came forth  
</span>

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel; and his  
name was called Jacob: and Isaac was three-score years old  
when she bare them.  
And the boys grew: and Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of  
the field; and Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.  
Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison:  
and Rebekah loved Jacob.  

</div>

The inner joyous life current (Isaac) gradually builds up a physical
body of great vitality and at the same time develops an active
mentality. These two phases of life, the mental and the physical, are
represented by Isaac's twin sons Jacob and Esau. They were twins, but
Esau was slightly the older, which fact under the Hebrew law gave him
the rights of the eldest son and made him Isaac's heir. Metaphysically
this denotes the physical vigor comes first at this stage of development
but that the mind accompanies it as a close second. Jacob had hold of
Esau's heel when they were born, showing that the mental is directly
connected with the physical and holds it in check at all times, even
from the beginning.

Isaac loved Esau better than he loved Jacob. When we remember that Isaac
represents joy in the individual consciousness we can understand why the
physical man seems to supply the needs of joy better than does the
mental. Esau continually brought venison (substance to nourish the
animal appetite) to please his father.

Rebekah loved Jacob better than she loved Esau. The exalted mother
principle (Rebekah) loves its expression (Jacob) better than the
physical expression (Esau) and seeks the blessing of the father
principle (Isaac) upon it.

Esau's birthright is the body and the all-round

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

development to which it is entitled. It is an inheritance of potential
mental powers, which rightly used will lift the physical man out of the
fleshly consciousness to the higher consciousness of the allness of
Divine Mind. Under the natural law of evolution the physical man (Esau)
is brought forth first and has precedence over the intellectual man
(Jacob). However in this allegory the physical man is overwhelmed by his
desire for creature comforts ("pottage") and does not sufficiently value
the mind power that has been given to man. The mental man, being on a
higher plane, naturally draws to himself the finer forces of being. In
consequence Jacob (the intellect) acquires precedence over Esau (the
body consciousness).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 25:29-33. And Jacob boiled pottage: and Esau
came in  
from the field, and he was faint: and Esau said to Jacob,  
Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am  
faint: therefore was his name called Edom. And Jacob said,  
Sell me first thy birthright. And Esau said, Behold, I am  
about to die: and what profit shall the birthright do to  
me? And Jacob said, Swear to me first; and he sware unto  
him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.  
</span>

</div>

The ambitious ideas of the intellect forge far ahead of the growth of
the body. Instead of supplying the body with its natural substance,
which is spiritual, it gives the body consciousness intellectual ideas
(boiled pottage). (Esau was named Edom, "red," because he sold his
birthright for the red pottage. Edom pertains to the outer man, the
physical phase of man's consciousness and organism.) This results in a
temporary separation in consciousness between the mind and the body.
Esau went his way, and Jacob became a man rich

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

in the world's goods. Under divine law, however, they were twins and the
separation was only apparent. They were to become united again and share
all the blessings that Jacob (intellect) had gained.

We must remember that the "birthright" that Esau so willingly bartered
away for a mess of pottage meant not only a right to the material goods
of his father Isaac but to the spiritual blessings of the covenant of
Abraham, which descending on him, should through him bless the world.
Instead of "Abraham, Isaac, and Esau" the immortal words would be
"Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." To a "profane person" (Heb. 12:16) this
would have no meaning, for spiritual blessings are visionary and unreal
to him.

The name Jacob means "supplanter." In the development of the spiritual
consciousness the supplanting quality finds its true office in replacing
selfishness with unselfishness. We who seek to bring the ideal into
active expression in our life know that to do this we must put into the
place occupied by willful self-seeking an unwavering faith in the unseen
God. The sensual must be supplanted by the spiritual, the apparent by
the ideal. The fact that Jesus approvingly cited the Jewish tradition in
His words "Many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit
down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven"
proves the value of this supplanting power or power that man has to
change his mind and so remake his consciousness and his life.

Jacob, representing a limited concept of the I AM, is ambitious to
receive original inspiration and is unwilling to let appetite and
passion rule. Therefore as the whole scheme of development is from lower
to

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

higher, Jacob (intellect) must supplant Esau (the immature consciousness
of the natural man that is moved by desire).

It is by the work of conscious re-creation of his life after the pattern
of the divine ideal that man gains self-dominion and becomes a citizen
of the kingdom of the heavens, the inner kingdom of peace and power.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 26:1-11. And there was a famine in the land,
besides  
the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac  
went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, unto Gerar.  
And Jehovah appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into  
Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:  
sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will  
bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give  
all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I  
sware unto Abraham thy father; and I will multiply thy seed  
as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all  
these lands; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the  
earth be blessed; because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and  
kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.  
And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: and the men of the place asked  
him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he  
feared to say, My wife; lest, said he, the men of the place  
should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look  
upon. And it came to pass, when he had been there a long  
time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at  
a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with  
Rebekah his wife. And Abimelech called Isaac, and said,  
Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou,  
She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said,  
Lest I die because of her. And Abimelech said, What is this  
thou hast done unto us? one of the people might easily have  
lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought  
guiltiness upon  
</span>

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

us. And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He that  
toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.  

</div>

The soul established in a consciousness of serenity, peace, laughter,
joy (Isaac), accepts spiritual things as real. God's promise is: "I will
be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I
will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I sware
unto Abraham thy father; and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of
heaven, and I will give unto thy seed all these lands; and in thy seed
shall all the nations of the earth be blessed." When there is a need of
substance the serene, joyous side of the soul through mind activity
penetrates into the subconsciousness (Gerar), where there is an
abundance of all things. But here the personal will (Abimelech) rules.
When a mind is not strong enough to work from principle or has not faith
enough to trust God, it exposes the beautiful and gracious side of its
nature (Rebekah) to the undisciplined sense consciousness, the law is
broken, and plagues result. In this case however personal will has
received enough light to preceive the truth and the threatened harm is
averted.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 26:12-22. And Isaac sowed in that land, and
found in  
the same year a hundredfold: and Jehovah blessed him. And  
the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became  
very great: and he had possessions of flocks, and  
possessions of herds, and a great household: and the  
Philistines envied him. Now all the wells which his  
father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his  
father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.  
And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art  
much mightier than we. And Isaac  
</span>

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and  
dwelt there.  
And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had  
digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the  
Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham:  
and he called their names after the names by which his  
father had called them. And Isaac's servants digged in the  
valley, and found there a well of springing water. And the  
herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The  
water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek,  
because they contended with him. And they digged another  
well, and they strove for that also: and he called the name  
of it Sitnah. And he removed from thence, and digged  
another well; and for that they strove not: and he called  
the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now Jehovah hath  
made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.  

</div>

Isaac was working according to law, and he was prospering. The Isaac
faculty in man has a double mission. Isaac was the connecting link
between Abraham and Israel; that is, between faith in God and rulership
or manifestation of God. His activity in "unstopping" the wells dug by
Abraham allegorizes the reopening of the hidden springs of life and the
keeping of the soul consciously connected with its inner source. Isaac
was not a well digger so much as a well "reopener." Abraham had dug the
wells. Faith delves into the deep things of Spirit and unearths the pure
life essence. In the beginning of spiritual unfoldment however the outer
senses (Philistines) suppress or crowd out this fine substance and life
of Spirit. The Philistines represent evil material thoughts that "fill
with earth" the channels of spiritual expression.

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

Isaac's first well was named Esek, a name signifying "violence" or
"contention." A warring takes place in the valley (the subconsciousness)
between the Philistine herdsmen (the animal desires) and Isaac's
servants (the awakening spiritual thoughts). The new energy and vigor of
life that man gains by his conscious contact with Spirit is sought by
the sense desires to be used at once for their gratification and
pleasure. They would take this fine essence and energy to build up sense
rather than to build up the spiritual nature. Thus contention and strife
arise.

The second well was called Sitnah, a name that also signifies "strife"
and "hatred." The material sense thoughts (Philistines) do not give up
easily but follow the individual a long way on his path to development
of a spiritual consciousness. However we read that Isaac's third well,
called Rehoboth (a name signifying "broad places" or "enlargements"),
was not taken by the Philistine. Material thoughts cannot continue to
follow and annoy the man who is persistent in his determination to find
the "water of life."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 26:23-33. And he went up from thence to
Beer-sheba.  
And Jehovah appeared unto him the same night, and said, I  
am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with  
thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my  
servant Abraham's sake. And he builded an altar there, and  
called upon the name of Jehovah, and pitched his tent  
there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.  
Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his  
friend, and Phicol the captain of his host. And Isaac said  
unto them, Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hate  
me, and have sent me away from you? And they said, We saw  
plainly  
</span>

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

that Jehovah was with thee: and we said, Let there now be  
an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us  
make a covenant with thee, that thou wilt do us no hurt, as  
we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee  
nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou  
art now the blessed of Jehovah. And he made them a feast,  
and they did eat and drink. And they rose up betimes in the  
morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them  
away, and they departed from him in peace. And it came to  
pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him  
concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto  
him, We have found water. And he called it Shibah:  
therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day.  

</div>

This Scripture interprets itself very definitely within the soul of man.
Isaac (spiritual peace, joy) under the guidance of Jehovah is conscious
of the I AM pioneering faith (symbolized by Abraham). In this "place" in
mind a new order is established, which denotes the willingness to give
up the lower for the higher, the personal for the impersonal, the animal
for the divine.

At this stage of the allegory appears Abimelech, King of the Philistines
(representing metaphysically the unregenerate will of the sense man).
With him he brings Ahuzzath (selfishness) and Phicol ("speech") and
tries to make an agreement with Isaac. The will (Abimelech) believes
that it is the rightful ruler of man and that all the rich substance
that comes to man from Spirit is for the gratification of sense desires.
Having witnessed the ever-increasing power and possessions of Isaac, who
represents divine sonship, Abimelech (the will) fears the loss of his
own rule and possessions.

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

The divine Son, the Christ, does not destroy but fulfills and saves.
Error eventually brings on its own destruction, but the error seems to
flourish along with the good during a certain period of development; the
wheat and tares are allowed to grow together until the harvest. The
harvesttime came when the Israelites under Joshua took possession of the
Promised Land. Even then the Philistines made several successful
comebacks and had to be defeated again and again.

There were seven wells altogether, culminating in the one named
Beer-sheba, "well of the oath" or "seventh well." The opening up of
these seven wells symbolizes the establishment of a right relation in
consciousness between the seven creative centers in natural man and the
spiritual powers of the Christ man. The whole allegory illustrates the
struggle going on within man for the possession of the life generated in
his body. This struggle takes place between the higher and the lower
nature of the individual--the spirtual soul and the animal soul--at a
certain stage of his development. Beer-sheba is the place where the
altar of victory is set up and God is given the thanks.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 26:34-35. And when Esau was forty years old he
took to  
wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath  
the daughter of Elon the Hittite: and they were a grief of  
mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.  
</span>

</div>

When Esau (the body consciousness) reaches the age of forty years (the
number forty denoting a certain degree of completeness) he takes two
wives (makes union with two forces), Judith and Basemath. Judith (the
feminine consciousness of prayer and praise) is the daughter of Beeri
(limitation). Basemath (the

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

ability to receive intuitively spiritual understanding and guidance) is
the daughter of Elon (materiality and transitoriness). Because of the
limiting, unenduring, material character of these forces, this union for
a season is bound to bring trial and grief to the higher spiritual
forces (Isaac and Rebekah) finding expression through the body
consciousness (Esau).

The Bible narrative about Jacob and Esau has always been read
historically, and theologians have had trouble trying to excuse Jacob
and Rebekah for their apparent duplicity in their dealings with Isaac
and Esau. When read in the light of spiritual understanding or
considered as part of the history of the unfoldment of the individual
soul, the incidents lose their aspect of duplicity and we find that they
are a description of the subtle working of the soul in spiritual
evolution under the guidance of Divine Mind. The soul is progressive. It
must go forward. The soul must meet and overcome its limitations.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 27:1-17. And it came to pass, that when Isaac
was old,  
and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called  
Esau his elder son, and said unto him, My son: and he said  
unto him, Here am I. And he said, Behold now, I am old, I  
know not the day of my death. Now therefore take, I pray  
thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to  
the field, and take me venison; and make me savory food,  
such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my  
soul may bless thee before I die.  
And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And  
Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring  
it. And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I  
heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, Bring  
me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and  
bless thee  
</span>

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

before Jehovah before my death. Now therefore, my son, obey  
my voice according to that which I command thee. Go now to  
the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the  
goats; and I will make them savory food for thy father,  
such as he loveth: and thou shalt bring it to thy father,  
that he may eat, so that he may bless thee before his  
death. And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau  
my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. My father  
peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a  
deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a  
blessing. And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy  
curse, my son; only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.  
And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother:  
and his mother made savory food, such as his father loved.  
And Rebekah took the goodly garments of Esau her elder son,  
which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob  
her younger son; and she put the skins of the kids of goats  
upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck: and she  
gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared,  
into the hand of her son Jacob.  

</div>

Jacob was very dear to the heart of his mother. Rebekah symbolizes the
beautiful and esthetic side of man's nature, the divine-natural. In
keeping with the mother principle, in which these twin states of mind
gestated and grew, she desires that the mental take precedence over the
animal. The seeming trickery on the part of Rebekah and Jacob is an
illustration of how we are moved by emotional states of consciousness
and how, in our half-blind understanding, we accept their suggestions.
The fact is that the soul (woman, Rebekah) is constantly making
suggestions to us in dreams, visions, and intuitive flashes. These
suggestions may sometimes be for our highest good and sometimes

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

they may not be. Spiritual understanding must determine this point and
decide whether we should follow them or not. Rebekah represents the love
of the ideal, and it is only through Jacob, the mental, that the ideal
can be realized.

The mind feels that its claim to the control of life should come before
the claims of physical sense. By its superior quickness, aided by the
soul's (Rebekah's) love of mental acumen, the mental tricks the physical
and secures the blessing of substance and the acknowledged authority in
the organism. Then the head rules the heart in us until the touch of
Spirit (Jacob's wrestling with the angel) arouses the soul to action and
there is another supplanting, this time of the intellect's sterile
claims, which are taken over by the soul. In reality the physical body
has an equal right with the intellect to the uplifting and refining
influence of Spirit. Being twins, they should be treated as equals, the
law of the first-born should not be allowed to operate, but should be
blessed and established in the substance of all good things.

The difference between Esau and Jacob is given to us in Jacob's own
words: "Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man."
The Semitic word for "hairy," translators tell us, has a connotation of
intemperance or licentiousness. In the Epistle to the Hebrews Paul calls
Esau a "fornicator, or profane person." This may be taken in a literal
sense or in the sense of one who commits spiritual adultery; that is,
who is unfaithful to God, divine love. The name Esau also signifies "one
swept away" or "one who rushes forward wildly and impulsively." He is
the very antipode of Jacob, "the smooth," clean, reliable man. The

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

word smooth is used in the story of David's victory over Goliath: David
took "five smooth stones out of the brook."

Esau is unfortunately no uncommon type. As for "smooth" men, very few
are smooth to start with. It is the constant rubbing, cutting, and
reshaping that makes them at last "the polished corners of the temple,"
good and beautiful after the pattern of heaven.

The denunciations of Esau by the prophets Jeremiah, Obadiah, and Malachi
were not directed against a man of that name but against the course of
conduct exemplified by him. Therefore it might well appear to Malachi,
interpreting the name metaphorically, that God loved Jacob and hated
Esau because Jacob symbolized the mental man and Esau the physical or
animal man.

<span class="small">Gen. 27:18-40. And he came unto his father, and
said, My  
father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son? And  
Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first-born; I  
have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee,  
sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me. And  
Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it  
so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah thy God  
sent me good speed. And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I  
pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my  
very son Esau or not. And Jacob went near unto Isaac his  
father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's  
voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. And he  
discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his  
brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him. And he said, Art  
thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am. And he said,  
Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison,  
that my soul may bless thee. And he  
</span>

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him  
wine, and he drank. And his father Isaac said unto him,  
Come near now, and kiss me, my son. And he came near, and  
kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and  
blessed him, and said,  
See, the smell of my son  
Is as the smell of a field which Jehovah hath blessed:  
And God give thee of the dew of heaven,  
And of the fatness of the earth,  
And plenty of grain and new wine:  
Let peoples serve thee,  
And nations bow down to thee:  
Be lord over thy brethren,  
And let thy mother's sons bow down to thee:  
Cursed be every one that curseth thee,  
And blessed be every one that blesseth thee.  
And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of  
blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the  
presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in  
from his hunting. And he also made savory food, and brought  
it unto his father; and he said unto his father, Let my  
father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul  
may bless me. And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art  
thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn, Esau. And  
Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who then is he  
that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have  
eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea,  
and he shall be blessed. When Esau heard the words of his  
father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry,  
and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my  
father. And he said, Thy brother came with guile, and hath  
taken away thy blessing. And he said, Is not he rightly  
named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he  
took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken  
away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a  
blessing for me?  

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made  
him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for  
servants; and with grain and new wine have I sustained him:  
and what then shall I do for thee, my son? And Esau said  
unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father?  
bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his  
voice, and wept. And Isaac his father answered and said  
unto him,  
Behold, of the fatness of the earth shall be thy dwelling,  
And of the dew of heaven from above;  
And by thy sword shalt thou live, and thou shalt serve thy  
brother;  
And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt break loose,  
That thou shalt shake his yoke from off thy neck.  

</div>

Jacob represents the man of spiritual insight: he is not exactly
spiritual but is beginning to see the possibilities of mind and is going
forward. In Truth Jacob represents the illumined intellect. Isaac was
not a spiritual man, but he represents one of the stages in the
evolution of spiritual man. When this evolution comes into manifestation
and pours out its essence upon the natural man (Esau), the spiritual
quality in the natural man is stimulated. It moves forward and
outdistances the physical, but the physical is not destroyed.

Isaac placed his blessing on Jacob. The real point is that the blessing
imparts an inward impetus or an inspiration to the real, spiritual man.
It stimulates the intellect (Jacob) first, which then supplants or takes
precedence over the physical. This is the reason why intellectual people
apparently get ahead; but "the last shall be first, and the first shall
be last."

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

The body is entitled to an equal blessing, as given by Isaac to Esau.

"And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt break loose,

That thou shalt shake his yoke from off thy neck." In other words, when
the body begins to realize its innate capacity the yoke of the mind is
broken. This phase of man's evolution may be said to be in evidence in
the struggle between capital and labor, or mind and body. Also there is
a recognition by the scientific world of a principle in the body that
directs it in the matter of food, healing, and in a general instinctive
knowing of all matters pertaining to its welfare.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 27:41-46. And Esau hated Jacob because of the
blessing  
wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his  
heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then  
will I slay my brother Jacob. And the words of Esau her  
elder son were told to Rebekah; and she sent and called  
Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy  
brother Esau as touching thee, doth comfort himself,  
purposing to kill thee. Now therefore, my son obey my  
voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;  
and tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury  
turn away; until thy brother's anger turn away from thee,  
and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will  
send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be bereaved  
of you both in one day?  
And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of  
the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the  
daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the  
land, what good shall my life do me?  
</span>

</div>

When cheated of its due the body rebels, as Esau

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

did, and the outraged cells react in a disorderly way on the mind.
Insane asylums bear witness to the fact that a neglected body will
destroy the channels through which the mind is meant to function
perfectly in man. The threat of Esau against the life of Jacob
represents the inward rebellion that we feel when we change our modes of
thought. The physical cannot be ignored. It must have its place in the
all-round, fully developed man. This truth is illustrated by Esau. He
became rich. He had many possessions, and he was the head of a race.

To avoid an open conflict Rebekah (the soul) ordered Jacob to flee to
her brother Laban at Haran. The name Laban means "white," "shining," and
the name Haran "exalted," "mountaineer." This clearly indicates that the
attention must be centered on exalted states of mind and united with
spiritual wisdom and understanding.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 28:1-9. And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed
him, and  
charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife  
of the daughters of Canaan. Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to  
the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a  
wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's  
brother. And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee  
fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a company  
of peoples; and give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee,  
and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the  
land of thy sojournings, which God gave unto Abraham. And  
Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Paddam-aram unto  
Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah,  
Jacob's and Esau's mother.  
Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away  
to Paddan-aram, to take him a wife  
</span>

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a  
charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters  
of Canaan; and that Jacob obey his father and his mother,  
and was gone to Paddan-aram: and Esau saw that the  
daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father, and Esau  
went unto Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had,  
Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister  
of Nebaioth, to be his wife.  

</div>

A man's marrying a wife symbolizes the union of the ego with certain
ideals. If these ideals are spiritual, then spiritual character is
developed with all its qualities. If the union is with inferior ideals,
like that of Esau, the fruit may be large in quantity, but it will be of
inferior quality. Jacob was admonished to go to Paddan-Aram
("tableland"), to the house of Bethuel ("dweller in God"), and to take a
wife from among the daughters of Laban ("shining," "pure"). Paddan-aram
represents levelheadedness, poise in Spirit; and Laban, with whom Jacob
(the unfolding ego) seeks association, represents a clear state of mind
in which higher understanding is dominant. Thus the way is pointed to a
unification with the love principle in its higher aspects. Jacob had
exalted ideals, divine aspirations, and now it was necessary that love
should become one of his attributes. High ideals, spiritual aspirations,
and pure motives are necessary to the union that the I AM makes with the
soul.

Esau took Mahalath, daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth, to be
his wife. The Ishmaelites represent the offspring of the natural,
unillumined races (states of mind). Nebaioth denotes the outer, sensate,
or material consciousness. Mahalath symbolizes a peaceful,

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

harmonious, tuneful attitude of the soul, found in expression on the
carnal and also on a higher plane.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 28:10-17. And Jacob went out from Beersheba,
and went  
toward Haran. And he lighted upon a certain place, and  
tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he  
took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his  
head, and lay down in that place to sleep. And he dreamed;  
and, behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of  
it reached to heaven; and, behold, the angels of God  
ascending and descending on it. And, behold, Jehovah stood  
above it, and said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham thy  
father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest,  
to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall  
be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad  
to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the  
south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families  
of the earth be blessed. And, behold, I am with thee, and  
will keep thee whithersoever thou goest, and will bring  
thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until  
I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. And Jacob  
awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely Jehovah is in  
this place; and I knew it not. And he was afraid, and said,  
How dreadful is this place! this is none other than the  
house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.  
</span>

</div>

On his journey to Haran--which had a double purpose: to escape the wrath
of the disappointed Esau, and "to take him a wife"--Jacob came to a
certain place where he tarried all night, "because the sun was set." He
took one of the stones that abounded in the place for use as a pillow
and lay down to sleep. This incident illustrates the fact that when we
are going through an emotional experience that is leading us upward to a

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

higher spiritual consciousness we may not understand what is happening,
may have no light on it ("the sun was set"), but if like Jacob we tarry
there in the darkness in meditation, the messengers of God--ideas of
Truth--will come to us in the subconsciousness (dreams).

Jacob's act of placing a stone under his head symbolizes the effort of
the understanding to put itself in a position to unravel the meaning of
matter and material conditions. In the very midst of seeming materiality
and darkened understanding the visions of the night reveal the ladder
reaching from earth to heaven and the angels of God (spiritual thoughts)
ascending it and descending it. The ladder represents the step-by-step
realization by means of which man assimilates the divine ideas of Truth
that come to him from Jehovah. Jehovah promised the land to Jacob and
his seed and assured Jacob of His continued presence and power: "Behold,
I am with thee, and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest, and will
bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee . . . And
Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely Jehovah is in this
place; and I knew it not."

God is right here in our midst. Understanding, when turned toward the
omnipresent light of Spirit, opens its eyes to the astonishing fact that
the seemingly material bodies and temporal surroundings conceal the
immanent God. Jacob said, "How dreadful is this place! this is none
other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven." When
divine wisdom reveals to us that our seemingly physical body is "none
other than the house of God," we are at first afraid. It seems
"dreadful" that we have made the Father's

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

house a "den of robbers."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Gen. 28:18-22. And Jacob rose up early in the
morning, and  
took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it  
up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. And he  
called the name of that place Bethe-el: but the name of the  
city was Luz at the first. And Jacob vowed a vow, saying,  
If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I  
go, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give  
me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, so that I come  
again to my father's house in peace, and Jehovah will be my  
God, then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar,  
shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I  
will surely give the tenth unto thee.  
</span>

</div>

In the morning of this new understanding even the temporal surroundings
become holy in our sight. Like Jacob we set up the common things, the
stones upon which we slept in ignorance, and pour the oil of joy and
gladness upon them. Then we name the place (our body temple and its
affairs) Bethel, the "house of God." Jacob took the stone that he had
used for a pillow and made a pillar of it. Instead of whining over the
hardness of his experience he blessed it and made it a sustaining point
in his mind.

Jacob was awestruck by the tremendous thought of omnipresence: what
seems so commonplace may be the very house of God, and thinking some
true thought or doing some loving act may be the gate of heaven. Jacob's
vow to be more faithful to God and to give Him one tenth of all he
received is a recognition of God as the source of all that man requires
and also of the need of a constant reminder of this fact; hence the
agreement to give back the tithe. Those who practice tithing testify
that it leads them into an understanding

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

of the relation of God to material affairs that they can get in no other
way. When a person feels that he has God for a partner in all his
financial affairs, he is never afraid of failure or lack.

In his inner consciousness man can make an agreement of this kind with
the Mind of Spirit and can keep it in his everyday affairs. Many
metaphysicians write out such contracts and put them away in the full
assurance that the terms will be carried out by both contracting
parties, God and man. It is found by nearly everyone who tries this plan
that the agreement is fulfilled. If you would have your material affairs
prosper, agree with Jehovah to give one tenth of your income to some
work dedicated to God. If you keep your part of the agreement, you may
rest assured that the Lord will keep His and abundantly prosper you,
that your financial affairs will be taken care of without worry or
strain on your part, and that you will come into a land where peace and
plenty go hand in hand.

When there is recognition in fact by the mental (Jacob) of the true
nature of the body's essence and of the spiritual nature of all life,
then we begin the ascent from self to selflessness. We are then willing
to give of our thought substance to God, and the house of God (the body)
bears witness to the sincerity of our vow.

The natural seeks to hold onto all that it can gain by fair or unfair
means, but the heart self, as soon as it has had a vision of the
infinite, seeks in its turn to give. In this dream Jacob heard the voice
of God saying, "To thee will I give . . ." When he awoke and came to
himself, his quickened heart echoed in thankful responsiveness, "I will
surely give . . . unto thee."
