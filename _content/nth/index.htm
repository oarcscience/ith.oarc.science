<P>
The New Thought movement, which originated in the late 19th
and early 20th century,
has at its core a belief that a higher power pervades all existence,
and that individuals can create their own reality via
affirmations, meditation and prayer.
Early New Thought groups emerged from a Christian Science background,
and many New Thought writers refer back to the Bible as their foundation text.
New Thought resembles in some respects New Age philosophy, although
some New Thought groups dismiss a connection.
This page includes some of the writings of this movement,
as well as related and similar texts.
