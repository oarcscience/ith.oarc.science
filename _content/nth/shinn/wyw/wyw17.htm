<p></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE DIVINE DESIGN</h3>  
<p align="center">(<i>See also The Game of Life and How to Play It</i>.)</p>  
<p>There is a Divine Design for each man!</p>  
<p>Just as the perfect picture of the oak is in the acorn, the divine pattern of his life is in the super-conscious mind of man.</p>  
<p>In the Divine Design there is no limitation, only health, wealth, love and perfect self-expression.</p>  
<p>So on man's pathway there is always a Divine Selection. Each day he must live according to the Divine Plan or have unhappy reactions.</p>  
<p>For example: A woman moved into a new apartment which she had almost furnished, when the thought came to her: "On that side of the room should stand a Chinese cabinet!</p>  
<p>Not long after, she was walking by an antique shop. She glanced in and there stood a magnificent Chinese cabinet about eight feet high, elaborately carved.</p>  
<p>She entered and asked the price. The salesman said it was worth a thousand dollars but the woman who owned it was willing to take less. The man added: "What will you offer for it?" The woman paused and the price "Two hundred dollars" came into her mind, so she answered: "Two  hundred dollars." The man said he would let her know if the offer were satisfactory.</p>  
<p>She did not want to cheat anyone or get anything which was not rightfully hers, so going home she said repeatedly: "<i>If it's mine I can't lose it and of it isn't mine, I don't want it</i>." It was a snowy day and she said she emphasized her words by kicking the snow from right to left, clearing a pathway to her apartment.</p>  
<p>Several days elapsed when she was notified that the woman was willing to sell the cabinet for two hundred dollars.</p>  
<p>There is a supply for every demand, from Chinese cabinets to millions of dollars.</p>  
<p>"Before ye call I shall answer," but, unless it is the Divinely Selected cabinet or millions they would never bring happiness.</p>  
<p>"Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it." (Psalm 127-1.) </p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  <h4 align="center">AFFIRMATIONS</h4>  
<p>I let go of everything not divinely designed for me, and the perfect plan of my life now comes to pass.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>What is mine by Divine Right can never be taken from me.</p>  
<p>God's perfect plan for me is built upon a rock.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I follow the magic path of intuition and find myself in my Promised Land, under grace.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>My mind, body and affairs are now molded according to the Divine pattern within.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>"God is the only power and that power is within me. There is only one plan, God's plan, and that plan now comes to pass."</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>"I give thanks that I now bring forth from the Universal Substance everything that satisfies all the righteous desires of my heart." </p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>The divine Design of my life now comes to pass. I now fill the place that I can fill and no one else can fill. I now do the things which I can do and no one else can do.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I am fully equipped for the Divine Plan of my life; I am more than equal to the situation.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>All doors now open for happy surprises and the Divine Plan of my life is speeded up under grace.</p>
