### SALES

A woman who lived in a country town wished to sell her house and
furniture. It was in the winter with snow so deep it was almost
impossible for cars or wagons to reach her door.

As she had asked God to sell her furniture to the right person for the
right price she was unmindful of appearances.

She polished the furniture, pushed it into the middle of the room and
prepared to sell it.

She said: "I never looked out of the window at the blizzard, I simply
trusted God's promises."

In miraculous ways people drove up and all the furniture was sold, and
the house also, without paying any commission to an agent.

Faith never looks out of the window at the blizzard, it simply prepares
for the blessing asked for.

#### AFFIRMATION

I give thanks that this article (or property) is now sold to the right
person or persons for the right price, giving perfect satisfaction.
