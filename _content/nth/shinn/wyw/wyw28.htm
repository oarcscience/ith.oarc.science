<p>The thing you dislike or hate will surely come upon you, for when man hates, he makes a vivid picture in the subconscious mind and it objectifies.</p>  
<p>The only way to erase these pictures is through non-resistance.</p>  
<p>(See <i>The Game of Life and How to Play It</i>.)</p>  
<p>For example: A woman was interested in a man who told her repeatedly of his charming women cousins.</p>  
<p>She was jealous and resentful and he passed out of her life.</p>  
<p>Later on she met another man to whom she was much attracted. In the course of their conversation he mentioned some women cousins he was very fond of.</p>  
<p>She resented it, then laughed, for here were her old friends "the cousins" back again.</p>  
<p>This time she tried non-resistance. She blessed all the cousins in the Universe and sent them good-will, for she knew if she didn't, every man she met would be stocked up with women relations.</p>  
<p>It was successful for she never heard cousins mentioned again.</p>  
<p></p>  
<p>This is the reason so many people have unhappy experiences repeated in their lives.</p>  
<p>I knew a woman who bragged of her troubles. She would go about saying to people; "I know what trouble is!" and then wait for their words of sympathy.</p>  
<p>Of course, the more she mentioned her troubles, the more she had, for by her words she "was condemned."</p>  
<p>She should have used her words to neutralize her troubles instead of to multiply them.</p>  
<p>For example&#151;had she said repeatedly: "I cast every burden upon the Christ within and I go free," and not voiced her sorrows, they would have faded from her life, for "<i>by your words you are justified</i>."</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>"I will give to thee the land that thou <i>seest</i>."</p>  
<p>Man is ever reaping on the external what he has sown in his thought world.</p>  
<p>For example: A woman needed money and was walking along the street making the affirmation that God was her immediate supply.</p>  
<p>She looked down and at her feet was a two dollar bill, which she picked up.</p>  
<p>A man standing near (a watchman in a building), said to her: "Lady, did you pick up some money? I thought it was a piece of chewing-gum paper. A lot of people walked over it, but <i>when you came it opened up like a leaf</i>."</p>  
<p>The others, thinking lack, had passed over it, but at her words of faith it unfurled. </p>  
<p>So with the opportunities in life&#151;one man sees, another passes by.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>"Faith without works (or action) is dead."</p>  
<p>The student, in order to bring into manifestation the answer to his prayer must show <i>active faith</i>.</p>  
<p>For example: A woman came to me asking me to speak the word for the renting of a room.</p>  
<p>I gave her the statement: "I give thanks that the room is now rented to the right and perfect man for the right price, giving perfect satisfaction."</p>  
<p>Several weeks elapsed but the room had not been rented.</p>  
<p>I asked: "Have you shown active faith? Have you followed every hunch in regard to the room?" She replied: "I had a hunch to get a lamp for the room, but I decided I couldn't afford it." I said: "You'll never rent the room until you get the lamp, for in buying the lamp you are <i>acting your faith</i>, impressing the subconscious mind with <i>certainty</i>."</p>  
<p>I asked: "What is the price of the lamp?" She answered: "Four dollars." I exclaimed: "Four dollars standing between you and the perfect man!"</p>  
<p>She became so enthusiastic, she bought <i>two</i> lamps.</p>  
<p>About a week elapsed and in walked the perfect man. He did not smoke and paid the rent in advance and fulfilled her ideal in every way. </p>  
<p>Unless you become as a little child and dig your ditches you shall in no wise enter the Kingdom of manifestation.</p>  
<p>(See <i>The Game of Life and How to Play It</i>.)</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>"Without the vision my people perish." Unless man has some objective, some Promised Land to look forward to, he begins to perish.</p>  
<p>We see it so often in small country towns, in the men who sit around a stove all winter, who "Ain&#146;t got no ambition."</p>  
<p>Within each one is an undiscovered country, a gold mine.</p>  
<p>I knew a man in a country town called "Magnolia Charlie," because he always found the first magnolia in the spring.</p>  
<p>He was a shoemaker, but every afternoon left his work to go to the station to meet the four-fifteen train, from a distant city.</p>  
<p>They were the only romances in his life, the first magnolia and the four-fifteen train.</p>  
<p>He felt vaguely the call of the vision in the superconscious mind.</p>  
<p>No doubt, the Divine Design for him included travel and perhaps he was to become a genius in the plant world.</p>  
<p>Through the spoken word the Divine Design may be released and each one fulfill his destiny.</p>  
<p>"I now see clearly the perfect plan of my life. Divine enthusiasm fires me and I now fulfill my destiny." </p>  
<p>The Spiritual attitude towards money is to know that God <i>is man's supply</i>, and that he draws it from the abundance of the spheres, through his faith and spoken word.</p>  
<p>When man realizes this he loses all greed for money, and is fearless in letting it go out.</p>  
<p>With his magic purse of the Spirit, his supply is <i>endless</i> and <i>immediate</i>, and he knows also that <i>giving</i> precedes <i>receiving</i>.</p>  
<p>For example: "A woman came to me asking me to speak the word for five hundred dollars by the first of August. (It was then about the first of July.)</p>  
<p>I knew her very well, and said: "The trouble with you is you don't <i>give</i> enough. You must open your channels of supply by <i>giving</i>."</p>  
<p>She had accepted an invitation to visit a friend and did not want to go on account of the formality.</p>  
<p>She said: "Please treat me to be polite for three weeks, and I want to get away as soon as possible, and be sure to speak the word for the five hundred dollars."</p>  
<p>She went to the friend's house, was unhappy and restless and tried continually to leave, but was always persuaded to stay longer.</p>  
<p>She remembered my advice, however, and gave the people about her presents. Whenever possible she made a little gift.</p>  
<p>It was nearing the first of August and no signs of the five hundred dollars, and no way of escape from the visit. </p>  
<p>The last day of July she said: "Oh God! maybe I haven't given enough!" So she tipped all the servants more than she had intended.</p>  
<p>The first of August, her hostess said to her: "My dear, I want to make you a gift," and she handed her a check for five hundred dollars!</p>  
<p>God works in unexpected ways his wonders to perform. </p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  <h4 align="center">AFFIRMATIONS</h4>  
<p>God is incapable of separation or division; therefore, my good is incapable of separation or division. I am <i>one</i> with my undivided good.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>All that is mine by Divine Right is now released and reaches me in a perfect way under Grace.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>God's work is finished now and must manifest.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I serve only faith and my unlimited abundance is made manifest.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I am undisturbed by appearances. I trust in God&#151;and He now brings to me the desires of my heart.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>My good now overtakes me in a surprising way.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>The Divine Plan of my life cannot be tampered with. It is incorruptible and indestructible. It awaits only my recognition. </p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>There is no there&#151;there is only here.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>Reveal to me the way, let me see clearly the blessing which Thou hast given me.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>Let Thy blessed will be done in me this day.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>Hunches are my hounds of Heaven&#151;they lead me in the perfect way.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>All things I seek are now seeking me.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>Divine Activity is now operating in my mind, body and affairs, whether I see it or not.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>Since I am one with the Only Presence, I am one with my heart's desire.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I now have the single eye of the Spirit and see only completion. </p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I am a perfect idea in Divine Mind and I am always in my right place doing my right work at the right time for the right pay.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>The Columbus in you will see you through.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I am an irresistible magnet for checks, bills and currency&#151;for everything that belongs to me by Divine Right.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>Thou in me art completion. As I have asked I must receive.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>The law of God is the law of increase and I give thanks for increase under grace in perfect ways.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I dwell in a sea of abundance. I see clearly my inexhaustible supply. I see clearly just what to do.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>My "World of the Wondrous" now swings into manifestation and I enter my Promised Land under grace! </p>  
<p>Great peace have I who love thy law of nonresistance and nothing shall offend me.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>Thou in me art Inspiration, Revelation and Illumination.</p>
