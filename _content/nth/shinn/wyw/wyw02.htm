<p></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">SUCCESS</h3>  
<p>There are certain words or pictures which impress the subconscious mind.</p>  
<p>For example: A man called asking me to speak the word for his right work.</p>  
<p>I gave him the statement: "Behold I have set before thee the open door of destiny and no man shall shut it!"</p>  
<p>It didn't seem to make much impression, so I was inspired to add: "And no man shall shut it for it is <i>nailed back!</i>"</p>  
<p>The man was electrified and went out walking on air. Within a few weeks he was called to a distant city to fill a wonderful position which came about in a miraculous way.</p>  
<p>I give another example of a woman who fearlessly followed a "hunch."</p>  
<p>She was working for a small salary when she read my book, <i>The Game of Life and How to Play It</i>. The thought came in a flash, to start in business for herself and open a Tearoom and Candy Shop.</p>  
<p>The idea staggered her at first, but it persisted, so she boldly went forth and procured a shop and assistants. </p>  
<p>She "spoke the word for supply," for she did not have money to back her enterprise. It came in miraculous ways, and the shop opened!</p>  
<p>From the first day it was filled with people, and now it is "crammed jammed"; they stand in line and wait.</p>  
<p>One day, being a holiday, her assistants became gloomy and said they could not expect to do much business. My student, however, replied that God was her supply and every day was a good day.</p>  
<p>In the afternoon an old friend came in to see the shop and bought a two pound box of candy. He gave her a check and when she looked at it she found it was for a hundred dollars. So it was indeed a good day! One hundred dollars for a box of candy!</p>  
<p>She says every morning she enters the shop with wonder and gives thanks that she had the fearless faith that wins!</p>  
<p></p>  <h4 align="center">AFFIRMATIONS</h4>  
<p>The decks are now cleared for Divine Action and my own comes to me under grace in a magical way.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I now let go of worn-out conditions and worn-out things.</p>  
<p>Divine order is established in my mind, body and affairs.</p>  
<p>"Behold, I make all things new."</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>My seeming impossible good now comes to pass, the unexpected now happens!</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>The "four winds of success" now blow to me my own.</p>  
<p>From North, South, East and West comes my endless good.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>The Christ in me is risen, I now fulfill my destiny.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>Endless good now comes to me in endless ways. </p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I clap my cymbals and rejoice, for Jehovah goes before me making clear, easy and successful my way!</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I give thanks for my whirlwind success.</p>  
<p>I sweep all before me for I work with the Spirit and follow the Divine Plan of my life.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>My Spiritual Sporting blood is up! I am more than equal to this situation.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I am awake to my good, and gather in the harvest of endless opportunities.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I am harmonious, poised and magnetic.</p>  
<p>I now draw to myself <i>my own</i>. My power is God's power and is irresistible!</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>Divine order is now established in my mind, body and affairs.</p>  
<p>I see clearly and act quickly and my greatest expectations come to pass in a miraculous way. </p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>There is no competition on the Spiritual plane. What is rightfully mine <i>is given me under grace</i>.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I have within me an undiscovered country, which is revealed to me now, in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>Behold! I have set before thee the open door of Destiny and no man shall shut it, for it is <i>nailed back</i>.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>The tide of Destiny has turned and everything comes my way.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I banish the past and now live in the wonderful now, where happy surprises come to me each day.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>There are no lost opportunities in Divine Mind, as one door shut <i>another door opened</i>.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I have a magical work in a magical way, I give magical service for magical pay. </p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>The genius within me is now released. I now fulfill my destiny.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I make friends with hindrances and every obstacle becomes a stepping-stone. Every-thing in the Universe, visible and invisible, is working to bring to me my own.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I give thanks that the walls of Jericho fall down and all lack, limitation and failure are wiped out of my consciousness in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I am now on the royal road of Success, Happiness and Abundance, all the traffic goes my way.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I will not weary of well-doing, for when I least expect it I shall reap.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>Jehovah goes before me and the battle is won!</p>  
<p>All enemy thoughts are wiped out.</p>  
<p>I am victorious in the name of Jesus Christ. </p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>There are no obstacles in Divine Mind, therefore, there is nothing to obstruct my good.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>All obstacles now vanish from my pathway.</p>  
<p>Doors fly open, gates are lifted and I enter the Kingdom of fulfillment, under grace.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>Rhythm, harmony and balance are now established in my mind, body and affairs.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>New fields of Divine activity now open for me and these fields are white with the harvest.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>Man's will is powerless to interfere with God's will. God's will is now done in my mind, body and affairs.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>God's plan for me is permanent and cannot be budged.</p>  
<p>I am true to my <i>heavenly vision</i>. </p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>"The Divine Plan of my life now takes shape in definite, concrete experiences leading to my heart's desire."</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I now draw from the Universal Substance, with irresistible power and determination, that which is mine by Divine Right.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I do not resist this situation. I put it in the hands of Infinite Love and Wisdom. <i>Let the Divine idea now come to pass</i>.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>My good now flows to me in a steady, unbroken, ever-increasing stream of success, happiness and abundance.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>There are no lost opportunities in the Kingdom.</p>  
<p>As one door shuts another door opens.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>"There is nothing to fear for there is no power to hurt."</p>  
<p>I walk up to the lion on my pathway and find an angel in armor, and victory in the name of Jesus Christ. </p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I am in perfect harmony with the working of the law. I stand aside and let Infinite Intelligence make easy and successful my way.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>The ground I am on is holy ground; The ground I am on is successful ground.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>New fields of Divine Activity now open for me.</p>  
<p>Unexpected doors fly open, unexpected channels are free.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>What God has done for others He can do for me and more!</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I am as necessary to God as He is to me, for I <i>am</i> the channel to bring <i>His plan to pass</i>.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I do not limit God by seeing limitation in myself. With God and myself all things are possible.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>Giving precedes receiving and my gifts to others precede God's gifts to me. </p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>Every man is a golden link in the chain of my good.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>My poise is built upon a rock. I see clearly and act quickly.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>God cannot fail, so I cannot fail. "The warrior within me" has already won.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>Thy Kingdom come in me, Thy will be done in me and my affairs.</p>
