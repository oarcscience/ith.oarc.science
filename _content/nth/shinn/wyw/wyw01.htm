<p></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">YOUR WORD</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center">IS</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center">YOUR WAND</h3>  
<p>Man's word is his wand filled with magic and power!</p>  
<p>Jesus Christ emphasized the power of the word; "By thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned," and "death and life are in power of the tongue."</p>  
<p>So man has power to change an unhappy condition by waving over it the wand of his word.</p>  
<p>In the place of sorrow appears joy, in the place of sickness appears health, in the place of lack appears plenty.</p>  
<p>For example: A woman came for a treatment for prosperity. She possessed just two dollars in the world.</p>  
<p>I said: "We bless the two dollars and know that you have the magic purse of the Spirit; it can never be depleted; as money goes out, immediately money comes in, under grace in perfect ways.</p>  
<p>I see it always crammed, jammed with money: yellow bills, green bills, pink checks, blue checks,  white checks, gold, silver and currency. I see it bulging with abundance!"</p>  
<p>She replied: "I feel my bag heavy with money," and was so filled with faith that she gave me one of her dollars as a love offering. I did not dare refuse it and see lack for her, as it was important that I hold the picture of plenty.</p>  
<p>Shortly afterwards she was made a gift of six thousand dollars. Fearless faith and the spoken word brought it to pass.</p>  
<p>The affirmation of the magic purse is very powerful, as it brings a vivid picture to the mind. It is impossible not to see your purse or wallet filled with money when using the words, "crammed, jammed."</p>  
<p>The imaging faculty is the creative faculty and it is important to choose words which bring a flash of the fulfillment of the demand.</p>  
<p>Never force a picture by visualizing; let the Divine Idea flash into your conscious mind; then the student is working according to the Divine Design.</p>  
<p>(See <i>The Game of Life and How to Play It</i>)</p>  
<p>Jesus Christ said: "Ye shall know the Truth and the Truth shall make you free."</p>  
<p>This means that man must know the Truth of every situation which confronts him.</p>  
<p>There is no Truth in lack or limitation. <i>He waves over it the wand of His Word and the wilderness rejoices and blossoms as the rose</i>.</p>  
<p>Fear, doubt, anxiety, anger, resentment pull down the cells of the body, shock the nervous system and are the causes of disease and disaster. </p>  
<p>Happiness and health must be earned by absolute control of the emotional nature.</p>  
<p>Power moves but is never moved. When man stands calm and serene, has a good appetite, feels contented and happy when appearances are against him, he has reached mastery. Then he has power to "rebuke the winds and the waves," to control conditions.</p>  
<p>His word is his wand and he transmutes apparent failure into success.</p>  
<p>He knows his universal supply is endless and immediate and all his needs manifest instantly on the external.</p>  
<p>For example, a woman at sea awoke in the morning hearing the fog-horns blowing. A dense fog had settled on the ocean with no apparent signs of clearing. She immediately spoke the word: "There are no fogs in Divine Mind, so let the fog be lifted! I give thanks for the sun!"</p>  
<p>Soon the sun came out, for man has dominion over "the elements&#151;over all created things."</p>  
<p>Every man has power to lift the fog in his life. It may be a fog of lack of money, love, happiness or health.</p>  
<p>Give thanks for the sun!</p>
