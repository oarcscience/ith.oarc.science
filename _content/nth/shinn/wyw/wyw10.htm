<p></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">LOSS</h3>  
<p>If man loses anything it shows there is a belief of loss in his subconscious mind. As he erases this false belief, the article, or its equivalent will appear on the external.</p>  
<p>For example: A woman lost a silver pencil in a theatre. She made every effort to find it but it was not returned.</p>  
<p>She denied loss, taking the affirmation: "I deny loss, there is no loss in Divine Mind, therefore I cannot lose that pencil. I will receive it or its equivalent."</p>  
<p>Several weeks elapsed. One day she was with a friend who wore about her neck on a cord, a beautiful gold pencil, who turned to her and said: "Do you want this pencil? I paid fifty dollars for it at Tiffany's."</p>  
<p>The woman was aghast, and replied (almost forgetting to thank her friend) "Oh! God aren't you wonderful! The silver pencil wasn't good enough for me!"</p>  
<p>Man can only lose what doesn't belong to him by Divine Right, or isn't good enough for him. </p>  <h4 align="center">AFFIRMATIONS</h4>  
<p>There is no loss in Divine Mind, therefore, I cannot lose anything that is rightfully mine.</p>  
<p>Infinite Intelligence is never too late! Infinite Intelligence knows the way of recovery.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>There is no loss in Divine Mind, therefore, I cannot lose anything which belongs to me.</p>  
<p>It will be restored or I receive its equivalent.</p>
