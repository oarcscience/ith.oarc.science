<p></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">FAITH</h3>  
<p>Hope looks forward, <i>Faith knows it has already received and acts accordingly</i>.</p>  
<p>In my classes I often emphasize the importance of digging ditches (or preparing for the thing asked for) which shows active faith and brings the demonstration to pass.</p>  
<p>(See <i>The Game of Life and How to Play It</i>.)</p>  
<p>A man in my class, whom I called "the life of the party," because he always tried to find a question I couldn't answer, but he never succeeded, asked: "Why is it then, a lot of women who prepare Hope Chests never get married?" I replied: "Because it is a Hope Chest and not a <i>Faith Chest</i>."</p>  
<p>The prospective bride also violates law in telling others about it. Her friends come in and sit on the Hope Chest and either doubt or hope she'll never succeed.</p>  
<p>"Pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly."</p>  
<p>The student should never talk of a demonstration until it "has jelled," or comes to pass on the external. </p>  
<p>So a Hope Chest should become a Faith Chest and be kept from the public eye, and the word spoken for the Divine Selection of a husband, under grace in a perfect way.</p>  
<p>Those whom God hath joined together no thought can put asunder. </p>  <h4 align="center">AFFIRMATIONS</h4>  
<p>Adverse appearances work for my good, for God utilizes every person and every situation to bring to me my heart's desire.</p>  
<p>"Hindrances are friendly" and obstacles spring boards!</p>  
<p>I now jump into my good!</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>As I am one with the <i>Undivided One</i>, I am one with my undivided good.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>As the needle in the compass is true to the north, what is rightfully mine is true to me.</p>  
<p><i>I am the North!&nbsp;</i></p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>"I am now linked by an invisible, unbreakable magnetic cord with all that belongs to me by Divine Right!</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>Thy Kingdom is come, Thy will is done in me and my affairs. </p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>Every plan my Father in heaven has not planned is dissolved and obliterated and the Divine Design of my life now comes to pass.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>What God has given me can never be taken from me for His gifts are for all eternity.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>My faith is built upon a rock and my heart's desire now comes to pass, under grace in a miraculous way.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I see my good in a golden glow of glory. I see my fields shining white with the harvest.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>God is my unfailing and immediate supply of all good.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I am poised and powerful, my greatest expectations are realized in a miraculous way.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I water my wilderness with faith and suddenly it blossoms as the rose. </p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I now exercise my fearless faith in three ways&#151;by thinking, speaking and acting.</p>  
<p>I am unmoved by appearances, therefore appearances move.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I stand steadfast, immovable, giving thanks for my seeming impossible good to come to pass, for I know, with God, it is easy of accomplishment, and His time is <i>now</i>.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>God's plans for me are built upon a rock. What was mine in the beginning, is mine now and ever shall be mine.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I <i>know</i> there is nothing to defeat God, therefore, there is nothing to defeat me.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I wait patiently on the Lord, I trust in Him, I fret not myself because of evil doers (for every man is a golden link in the chain of my good) and He now gives to me the desires of my heart! (See 37th Psalm.) </p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I have now the fearless faith of the Christ within. At my approach barriers vanish and obstacles disappear.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I am steadfast, immovable, for the fields are already white with the harvest. My fearless faith in God now brings the Divine Design of my life to pass.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>All fear is now banished in the name of Jesus Christ, for I know there is no power to hurt.</p>  
<p>God is the one and only power.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I am in perfect harmony with the working of the law, for I know that Infinite Intelligence knows nothing of obstacles, time or space. It knows only completion.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>God works in unexpected and magic ways His wonders to perform.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I now prepare for the fulfillment of my heart's desire. I show God I believe His promise will be kept. </p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I now dig my ditches deep with faith and understanding and my heart's desire comes to pass in a surprising way.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>My ditches will be filled at the right time, bringing all that I have asked for, and more!</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I now "put to flight the army of the aliens" (negative thoughts). They feed on fear and starve on faith.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>God's ideas cannot be moved, therefore, what is mine by Divine Right will always be with me.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I give thanks that I now receive the righteous desires of my heart.</p>  
<p>Mountains are removed, valleys exalted and every crooked place made straight.</p>  
<p>I am in the Kingdom of fulfillment.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I have perfect confidence in God and God has perfect confidence in me. </p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>God's promises are built upon a rock. As I have asked I <i>must</i> receive.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>"Let me never wander from my heart's desire."</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I do not limit the Holy One of Israel, in word, thought or deed.</p>  
<p>With God all things are easy and possible now.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I now stand aside and watch God work.</p>  
<p>It interests me to see how quickly and easily He brings the desires of my heart to pass.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>Before I called I was answered and I now gather in my harvest in a remarkable way.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>He who watches over my heart's desire "Neither slumbers nor sleeps."</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>Seeming impossible doors now open, seeming impossible channels are free, in the name of <i>Jesus Christ</i>. </p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>My good is a perfect and permanent idea in Divine Mind, and must manifest for there is nothing to prevent.</p>  
<p align="center">&#151;&#151;&#151;</p>  
<p>I cast every burden on the Christ within and I go free!</p>
