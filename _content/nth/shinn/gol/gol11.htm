<p></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">DENIALS AND AFFIRMATIONS</h3>  
<p align="center">(For Prosperity)</p>  
<p>God is my unfailing supply, and large sums of money come to me quickly, under grace, in perfect ways.</p>  
<p align="center">(For Right Conditions)</p>  
<p>Every plan my Father in heaven has not planned, shall be dissolved and dissipated, and the Divine Idea now comes to pass.</p>  
<p align="center">(For Right Conditions)</p>  
<p>Only that which is true of God is true of me, for I and the Father are ONE.</p>  
<p align="center">(For Faith)</p>  
<p>As I am one with God, I am one with my good, for God is both the <i>Giver</i> and the <i>Gift</i>. I cannot separate the <i>Giver</i> from the gift.</p>  
<p align="center">(For Right Conditions)</p>  
<p>Divine Love now dissolves and dissipates every wrong condition in my mind, body and affairs. Divine Love is the most powerful chemical in the universe, and <i>dissolves everything</i> which is not of itself!</p>  
<p align="center">(For Health)</p>  
<p>Divine Love floods my consciousness with health, and every cell in my body is filled with light. </p>  
<p align="center">(For the Eyesight)</p>  
<p>My eyes are God's eyes, I see with the eyes of spirit. I see clearly the open way; there are no obstacles on my pathway. I see clearly the perfect plan.</p>  
<p align="center">(For Guidance)</p>  
<p>I am divinely sensitive to my intuitive leads, and give instant obedience to Thy will.</p>  
<p align="center">(For the Hearing)</p>  
<p>My ears are God's ears, I hear with the ears of spirit. I am nonresistant and am willing to be led. I hear glad tidings of great joy.</p>  
<p align="center">(For Right Work)</p>  
<p align="center"><i>I have a perfect work<br> In a perfect way;<br> I give a perfect service<br> For perfect pay</i>.</p>  
<p align="center">(For Freedom from all Bondage)</p>  
<p><i>I cast this burden on the Christ within, and I go free!&nbsp;</i></p>
