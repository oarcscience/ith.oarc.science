Florence Scovel Shinn (b. Sept. 24, 1871, d. Oct. 17, 1940) was a New
Thought teacher and writer. She resided in New York City most of her
life, teaching at the New York Unity Society. She came from a blue-blood
family, with a line going back to the Mayflower Biddles. However they
were not wealthy. From 1889 to 1897, she was an art student in
Phildelphia. There she met her future husband, Everett Shinn
(1876-1953), a prominent American artist who was part of a group called
"The Eight", which later became the 'Ashcan School' of urban realists.
The couple moved to New York City, and both pursued artistic careers,
with Florence becoming an illustrator. They divorced in 1912, and
Florence apparently turned to New Thought shortly thereafter. In the
early 1920s, she wrote and self-published her first book, The Game of
Life.

Florence Scovel Shinn's approach to New Thought is practical, filled
with references to popular culture (she made an elaborate parable out of
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs). Shinn was attempting to bring
metaphysical ideas down to earth for everyday people, and she succeeds
for the most part. Affirmations are at the center of Shinn's method. She
wrote a huge number of pithy affirmations which are still circulating in
the New Thought literature and society at large today. Her books
continue to appeal to readers who want guidance in difficult times.
