This short book by Ralph Waldo Trine stands out in the huge body of New
Thought literature for several reasons. First of all, he uses the phrase
'A Science of Mind' nearly two decades before the [Ernest Holmes
book](../../eso/som/index) of the same title. Second, and much more
importantly, is the stress he places on service and compassion, not only
to humanity, but to also animals, in fact, all sentient or conscious
beings. This, of course, echoes Buddhist sentiments. It also addresses
one objection which often comes up in discussions of New Thought: if we
create the universe with our own minds, why should we care about others?
Trine clearly states that an ability to care for others is central to
being able to access one's inner power. Lastly, he says plainly that the
best way to achieve this is by 'silence.' Where others waltz around the
issue of how to develop mental powers, Trine offers a powerful and
simple technique to do so, what we today call meditation.

This thought-provoking book, which can be read in one sitting, is a
perennial classic of this genre.
