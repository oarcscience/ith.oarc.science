### THE AWAKENING.

If you'd live a religion that's noble,  
  That's God-like and true,  
A religion the grandest that men  
  Or that angels can,  
Then live, live the truth  
  Of the brother who taught you,  
It's love to God, service and love  
  To the fellow-man.

SOCIAL problems are to be among the greatest problem of the generation
just moving on to the stage of action. They, above all others, will
claim the attention of mankind, as they are already claiming it across
the waters even as at home. The attitude of the two classes toward each
other, or the separation of the classes, will be by far the chief
problem of them all. Already it is imperatively demanding a solution.
Gradually, as the years have passed, this separation has been going on,
but never so rapidly as of late. Each has come to regard the other as an
enemy, with no interests in common, but rather that what is for the
interests of the one must necessarily be to the detriment of the other.

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

The great masses of the people, the working classes, those who as much,
if not more than many others ought to be there, are not in our churches
to-day. They already feel that they are not wanted there, and that the
Church even is getting to be their enemy. There must be a reason for
this, for it is impossible to have an effect without its preceding
cause. It is indeed time to waken up to these facts and conditions; for
they must be *squarely* met. A solution is imperatively demanded, and
the sooner it comes, the better; for, if allowed to continue thus, all
will come back to be paid for, intensified a thousand-fold,—ay, to be
paid for even by many innocent ones.

Let this great principle of service, helpfulness, love, and
self-devotion to the interests of one's fellow-men be made the
fundamental principle of all lives, and see how simplified these great
and all-important questions will become. Indeed, they will almost solve
themselves. It is the man all for self, so small and so short sighted
that he can't get beyond his own selfish interests, that has done more
to bring about this state of affairs than all other causes combined. Let
the cause be removed, and then note the results.

For many years it has been a teaching even

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

of political economy that an employer buys his help just as he buys his
raw material or any other commodity; and this done, he is in no way
responsible for the welfare of those he employs. In fact, the time isn't
so far distant when the employed were herded together as animals, and
were treated very much as such. But, thanks be to God, a better and a
brighter day is dawning. Even the employer is beginning to see that
practical ethics, or true Christianity, and business cannot and must not
be divorced; that the man he employs, instead of being a mere animal
whose services he buys, is, after all his fellow-man and his brother,
and demands a treatment as such, and that when he fails to recognize
this truth, a righteous God steps in, demanding a penalty for its
violation.

He is recognizing the fact that whatsoever is for the well-being of the
one he employs, that whatever privileges he is enabled to enjoy that
will tend to grow and develop his physical, his mental, and his moral
life, that will give him an agreeable home and pleasant family
relations, that whatever influences tend to elevate him and to make his
life more happy, are a direct gain, even from a financial standpoint for
himself, by its increasing for

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

him the efficiency of the man's labor. It is already recognized as a
fact that the employer who interests himself in these things, other
things being equal, is the most successful. Thus the old and the false
are breaking away before the right and the true, as all inevitably must
sooner or later; and the divinity and the power of the workingman is
being ever more fully recognized.

In the very remote history of the race there was one who, violating a
great law, having wronged a brother, asked, "Am I my brother's keeper?"
Knowing that he was, he nevertheless deceitfully put the question in
this way in his desire, if possible, to avoid the responsibility. Many
employers in their selfishness and greed for gain have asked this same
question in this same way. They have thought they could thus defeat the
sure and eternal laws of a Just Ruler, but have thereby deceived
themselves the more. These more than any others have to a great degree
brought about the present state of affairs in the industrial and social
world.

Just as soon as the employer recognizes the falsity of these old
teachings and practices, and the fact that he cannot buy his employee's
services the same as he buys his raw material,

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

with no further responsibility, but that the two are on vastly different
planes, that his employee is his fellow-man and his brother, and that he
is his brother's keeper, and will be held responsible as such, that it
is to his own highest interests, as well as to the highest interests of
those he employs and to society in general, to recognize this; and just
as soon as he who is employed fully appreciates his opportunities and
makes the highest use of all, and in turn takes an active, personal
interest in all that pertains to his employer's welfare,—just that soon
will a solution of this great question come forth, and no sooner.

It is not so much a question of legislation as of education and right
doing, thus a dealing with the *individual*, and so a prevention and a
cure, not merely a suppression and a regulation, which is always sure to
fail; for, in a case of right or wrong no question is ever settled
finally until it is settled rightly.

The individual, dealing with the individual is necessarily at the bottom
of all true social progress. There can't be anything worthy the name
without it. The truth will at once be recognized by all *that the good
of the whole depends upon the good of each, and the good of* 

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

*each makes the good of the whole*. Attend, then, to the individual, and
the whole will take care of itself. Let each individual work in harmony
with every other, and harmony will pervade the whole. The old theory of
competition that in order to have great advancement, great progress, we
must have great competition to induce it—is as false as it is savage and
detrimental in its nature. We are just reaching that point where the
larger men and women are beginning to see its falsity. They are
recognizing the fact that, *not competition, but co-operation,
reciprocity, is the great, the true power*,—to climb, not by attempting
to drag, to keep down one's fellows, but by aiding them, and being in
turn aided by them, thus combining, and so multiplying the power of all
instead of wasting a large part one against the other.

And grant that a portion do succeed in rising, while the other portion
remain in the lower condition, it is of but little value so far as their
own peace and welfare are concerned; for they can never be what they
would be, were all up together. Each is but a part, a member, of the
great civil body; and no member, let alone the entire body, can be
perfectly well, perfectly at ease, when any other part is

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

in dis-ease. No one part of the community, no one part of the nation,
can stand alone: all are dependent, interdependent. This is the uniform
teaching of history from the remotest times in the past right through to
the present. A most admirable illustration of this fact—if indeed the
word "admirable" can be used in connection with a matter so
deplorable—was the unparalleled labor trouble we had in our great
Western city but a few summers ago. The wise man is he who learns from
experiences of this terrific nature.

No, not until this all-powerful principle is fully recognized, and is
built upon so thoroughly that the brotherhood principle, the principle
of oneness can enter in, and each one recognizes the fact that his own
interests and welfare depend upon the interests, the welfare of each,
and therefore of all, that each is but a part of the one great whole,
and each one stands shoulder to shoulder in the advance forward, can we
hope for any true solution of the great social problems before us, for
any permanent elevation of the standard in our national social life and
welfare.

This same principle is the solution, and the only true solution, of the
charities question, as indeed the whole world during the last few

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

years or so, and during this time only, is beginning to realize. And the
splendid and efficient work of the organized charities in all our large
cities, as of the Elberfeld system in Germany, is attesting the truth of
this. Almost numberless methods have been tried during the past, but all
have most successfully failed; and many have greatly increased the
wretched condition of matters, and of those it was designed to help.
During this length of time only have these all-important questions been
dealt with in a true, scientific, Christ-like, common-sense way. It has
been found even here that nothing can take the place of the personal and
friendly influences of a life built upon this principle of service.

The question of aiding the poor and needy has passed through three
distinct phases of development in the world's history. In early times it
was, "Each one for himself, and the devil take the hindmost." From the
time of the Christ, and up to the last few years it has been, "Help
others." Now it is, "*Help others to kelp themselves*." The wealthy
society lady going down Fifth Avenue in New York, or Michigan Avenue in
Chicago, or Charles Street in Baltimore, or Commonwealth Avenue in
Boston, who flings a coin to one asking

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

alms, is not the one who is doing a true act of charity; but, on the
other hand, she may be doing the one she thus gives to and to society in
general much more harm than good, as is many times the case. It is but a
cheap, a very cheap way of buying ease for her sympathetic nature or her
sense of duty. Never let the word "charity," which always includes the
elements of interested service, true helpfulness, kindliness, and love,
be debased by making it a synonym of mere giving, which may mean the
flinging of a quarter in scorn or for show.

Recognizing the great truth that the best and only way to help another
is to help him to help himself, and that the neglected classes need not
so much alms as friends, the Organized Charities with their several
branches in different parts of the city have their staffs of "friendly
visitors," almost all voluntary, and from some of the best homes in the
land. Then when a case of need comes to the notice of the society, one
of these goes to the person or family as a *friend* to investigate, to
find what circumstances have brought about these conditions, and, if
found worthy of aid, present needs are supplied, an effort is made to
secure work, and every effort is made to

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

put them on their feet again, that self-respect may be regained, that
hope may enter in; for there is scarcely anything that tends to make one
lose his self-respect so quickly and so completely as to be compelled,
or of his own accord, to ask for alms.

It is thus many times that a new life is entered upon, brightness and
hope taking the place of darkness and despair. This is not the only call
the friendly visitor makes; but he or she becomes a *true friend*, and
makes regular visits as such. If by this method the one seeking charity
is found to be an impostor, as is frequently the case, proper means of
exposure are resorted to, that his or her progress in this course may be
stopped. The organizations are thus doing a most valuable work, and one
that will become more and more valuable as they are enabled to become
better organized, the greatest need to-day being more with the true
spirit to act as visiting friends.

It is this same great principle that has given birth to our college and
university settlements and our neighborhood guilds which are so rapidly
increasing, and which are destined to do a great and efficient work.
Here a small colony of young women, many from our

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

best homes, and the ablest graduates of our best colleges, and young
men, many of them the ablest graduates of our best universities, take up
their abode in the poorest parts of our large cities, to try by their
personal influence and personal contact to raise the surrounding life to
a higher plane. It is in these ways that the poor and the unfortunate
are dealt with directly. Thus the classes mingle. Thus that
sentimentalism which may do and which has done harm to these great
problems, and by which the people it is designed to help may be hindered
rather than helped, is done away with. Thus true aid and service are
rendered, and the needy are really helped.

The one whose life is built upon this principle will not take up work of
this kind as a "fad," or because it is "fashionable," but because it is
right, true, Christ-like. The truly great and noble never fear thus to
mingle with those poorer and less fortunate. It is only those who would
like to be counted as great, but who are too small to be so recognized,
and who, therefore, always thinking of self, put forth every effort to
appear so. There is no surer test than this.

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

Very truly has it been said that "the greatest thing a man can do for
God is to be kind to some of His other children." All children of the
same Father, therefore all brothers, sisters. Man is next to God. Man is
God incarnate. Humanity, therefore, cannot be very far from being next
to godliness. Many people there are who are greatly concerned about
serving God, as they term it. Their idea is to build great edifices with
costly ornaments to Him. A great deal of their time is spent in singing
songs and hallelujahs to Him, just as if *He* needed or wanted these for
Himself, forgetting that He is far above being benefited by anything
that we can say or do, forgetting that He doesn't want these, when for
lack of them some of His children are starving for bread to eat or are
dying for the bread of life.

Can you conceive of a God who is worthy of love and service,—and I speak
most reverently,—who under such conditions would take a satisfaction in
these things? I confess I am not able to. I can conceive of no way in
which I can serve God only as I serve Him through my own life and
through the lives of my fellow-men. This, certainly, is the only kind of
service He needs or wants, or that

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

is acceptable to Him. At one place we read, "He that says he loves God
and loves not his fellow-men, is a liar; and the truth is not in him."

Even in religion I think we shall find that there is nothing greater or
more important than this great principle of service, helpfulness,
kindliness, and love. Is not Christianity, you ask, greater or more
important? Why, bless you, is this any other than Christianity, is
Christianity any other than this,—at least, if we take what the Master
Teacher himself has said? For what, let us ask, is a Christian,—the
real, not merely in name? A follower of Christ, one who does as he did,
one who lives as he lived. And, again, who was Christ? He that healed
the sick, clothed the naked, bound up the broken-hearted, sustained and
encouraged the weak, the faltering, befriended and aided the poor, the
needy, condemned the proud and the selfish, taught the people to live
nobly, truly, grandly, to live in their higher, diviner selves, that the
greatest among them should be their servant, and that his followers were
those who lived as he lived. He spent all his time in the service of
humanity. He gave his whole life in this way. He it was who went about
doing good.

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

Is it your desire then, to be numbered among his followers, to bear that
blessed name, the name "Christian"? Then sit at his feet, and learn of
him, love him, do as he did, as he taught you to do, live as he lived,
as he taught you to live, and you are a Christian, and not unless you
do. True Christianity can be found in no other way.

Naught is the difference what one may call himself; for many call
themselves by this name to whom Christ says it will one day be said, "I
never knew you: depart from me, ye cursed." Naught is the difference
what creeds one may subscribe to, what rites and ceremonies he may
observe, how loud and how numerous his professions may be. All of these
are but as a vain mockery, unless he is a Christian; and to be a
Christian is, as we have found, to be a follower of Christ, to do as he
did, to live as he lived. Then live the Christ life. Live so as to
become at one with God, and dwell continually in this blessed
at-one-ment. The trouble all along has been that so many have mistaken
the mere person of the Christ, the mere physical Jesus, for his life,
his spirit, his teachings, and have succeeded in getting no farther than
this as yet, except in cases here and there.

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

Now and then a rare soul rises up, one with great power, great
inspiration, and we wonder at his great power, his great inspiration,
why it is. When we look deeply enough, however, we will find that one
great fact will answer the question every time. It is living the life
that brings the power. He is living the Christ life, not merely standing
afar off and looking at it, admiring it, and saying, Yes, I believe, I
believe, and ending it there. In other words, he has found the kingdom
of heaven. He has found that it is not a place, but a condition; and the
song continually arising from his heart is, There is joy, only joy.

The Master, you remember, said: "Seek ye not for the kingdom of heaven
in tabernacles or in houses made with hands. Know ye not that the
kingdom of heaven is within you?" He told in plain words where and how
to find it. He then told how to find *all other* things, when he said,
"Seek ye first the kingdom of heaven, and all these other things shall
be added unto you." Now, do you wonder at his power, his inspiration,
his abundance of all things? The trouble with so many is that they act
as if they do not believe what the Master said. They do not take him

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

at his word. They say one thing: they do another. Their acts give the
lie to their words. Instead of taking him at his word, and living as if
they had faith in him, they prefer to follow a series of old, outgrown,
man-made theories, traditions, forms, ceremonies, and seem to be
satisfied with the results. No, *to be a Christian is to live the Christ
life*, the life of him who went about doing good, the life of him who
came not to be ministered unto, but to minister.

We will find that this mighty principle of love and service is the
greatest to live by in this life, and also one of the gates whereby all
who would must enter the kingdom of heaven.

Again we have the Master's words. In his own and only description of the
last judgment, after speaking of the Son of Man coming in all his glory
and all the holy angels with him, of his sitting on the throne of his
glory with all nations gathered before him, of the separation of this
gathered multitude into two parts, the one on his right, the other on
his left, he says: "Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand,
Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from
the foundation of the world. For I was an

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

hungered, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I
was a stranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick,
and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me. Then shall the
righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we *thee* an hungered, and
fed *thee?* or thirsty, and gave *thee* drink? When saw we *thee* a
stranger, and took *thee* in? or naked, and clothed *thee?* Or when saw
we *thee* sick, or in prison, and came unto *thee?* And the King shall
answer, and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, *Inasmuch as ye have
done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto
me*.

"Then shall he say unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye
cursed. For I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirsty,
and ye gave me no drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; sick,
and in prison, and ye visited me not. Then shall they answer him,
saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, or athirst, or a stranger,
or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? Then
shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, *Inasmuch as ye did
it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me*."

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

After spending the greater portion of his life in many distant climes in
a fruitless endeavor to find the Cup of the Holy Grail, <span
id="fr_2"></span>[\*](#fn_2) thinking that thereby he was doing the
greatest service he could for God, Sir Launfal at last returns an old
man, gray-haired and bent. He finds that his castle is occupied by
others, and that he himself is an outcast. His cloak is torn; and
instead of the charger in gilded trappings he was mounted upon when as a
young man, he started out with great hopes and ambitions, he is afoot
and leaning on a staff. While sitting there and meditating, he is met by
the same poor and needy leper he passed the morning he started, the one
who in his need asked for aid, and to whom he had flung a coin in scorn,
as he hurried on in his eager desire to be in the Master's service. But
matters are changed now, and he is a wiser man. Again the poor leper
says:—

“‘For Christ's sweet sake, I beg an alms’;—  
 The happy camels may reach the spring,  
 But Sir Launfal sees only the grewsome thing, <span id="page_129">p.
129</span>  
 The leper, lank as the rain-blanched bone,  
 That cowers beside him, a thing as lone  
 And white as the ice-isles of Northern seas  
 In the desolate horror of his disease.

“And Sir Launfal said: ‘I behold in thee  
 An image of Him who died on the tree;  
 Thou also hast had thy crown of thorns,—  
 Thou also hast had the world's buffets and scorns,—  
 And to thy life were not denied  
 The wounds in the hands and feet and side:  
 Mild Mary's Son, acknowledge me;  
 Behold, *through him*, I give to thee!’

“Then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes  
 And looked at Sir Launfal, and straightway he  
 Remembered in what a haughtier guise  
 He had flung an alms to leprosie,  
 When he girt his young life up in gilded mail  
 And set forth in search of the Holy Grail.  
 The heart within him was ashes and dust;  
 He parted in twain his single crust,  
 He broke the ice on the streamlet's brink,  
 And gave the leper to eat and drink,  
 ’Twas a mouldy crust of coarse brown bread,  
 ’Twas water out of a wooden bowl,—  
 Yet with fine wheaten bread was the leper fed,  
 And 'twas red wine he drank with his thirsty soul.

“As Sir Launfal mused with a downcast face,  
 A light shone round about the place; <span id="page_130">p.
130</span>  
 The leper no longer crouched at his side,  
 But stood before him glorified,  
 Shining and tall and fair and straight  
 As the pillar that stood by the Beautiful Gate,—  
 Himself the Gate whereby men can  
 Enter the temple of God in Man.

“And the voice that was calmer than silence said,  
 ‘Lo, it is I, be not afraid!  
 In many climes, without avail,  
 Thou hast spent thy life for the Holy Grail;  
 Behold, it is here,—this cup which thou  
 Didst fill at the streamlet for me but now;  
 This crust is my body broken for thee,  
 This water His blood that died on the tree;  
 The Holy Supper is kept, indeed,  
 In whatso we share with another's need;  
 Not what we give, but what we *share*,—  
 For the gift without the giver is bare;  
 Who gives himself with his alms feeds three,—  
 Himself, his hungering neighbor, and me.’”

The fear is sometimes entertained, and the question is sometimes asked,
May not adherence to this principle of helpfulness and service become
mere sentimentalism? or still more, may it not be the means of lessening
another's sense of self-dependence, and thus may it not at times do more
harm than good? In reply let it be said: If the love which impels it be
a selfish love, or a weak sentimentalism, or an effort at show, or
devoid of good

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

common sense, yes, many times. But if it be a strong, genuine, unselfish
love, then no, never. For, if my love for my fellow-man be the true
love, I can never do anything that will be to his or any one's else
detriment,—nothing that will not redound to his highest ultimate
welfare. Should he, for example come and ask of me a particular favor,
and were it clear to me that granting it would not be for his highest
good ultimately, then love at once resolves itself into duty, and
compels me to forbear. A true, genuine, unselfish love for on 's
fellow-man will never prompt, and much less permit, anything that will
not result in his highest ultimate good. Adherence, therefore, to this
great principle in its truest sense, instead of being a weak
sentimentalism, is, we shall find, of all practical things the *most
intensely practical*.

And a word here in regard to the test of true love and service, in
distinction from its semblance for show or for vain glory. The test of
the true is this: that it goes about and 0' does its good work, it never
says anything about it, but lets others do the saying. It not only says
nothing about it, but more, it has no desire to have it known; and, the
truer it is, the greater the desire to have it unknown save

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

to God and its own true self. In other words, it is not sicklied o’er
with a semi-insane desire for notoriety or vainglory, and hence never
weakens itself nor harasses any one else by lengthy recitals of its good
deeds. It is not the *professional* good-doing. It is simply living its
natural life, open-minded, openhearted, doing each day what its hands
find to do, and in this finding its own true life and joy. And in this
way it unintentionally but irresistibly draws to itself a praise the
rarest and divinest I know of,—the praise I heard given but a day or two
ago to one who is living simply his own natural life without any
conscious effort at anything else, the praise contained in the words:
And, oh, it is beautiful, the great amount of good he does and of which
the world never hears.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2"></span>[128:\*](waws06.htm#fr_2) "According to the
mythology of the Romancers, the Sangreal, or Holy Grail, was the cup out
of which Jesus partook of the Last Supper with his disciples. It was
brought into England by Joseph of Arimathea, and remained there, an
object of pilgrimage and adoration, for many years in the keeping of his
lineal descendants. It was incumbent upon those who had charge of it to
be chaste in thought, word, and deed; but, one of the <span
id="page_129">p. 129</span> keepers having broken this condition, the
Holy Grail disappeared. From that time it was a favorite enterprise of
the Knights of Sir Arthur's court to go in search of it."—*James Russell
Lowell*.
