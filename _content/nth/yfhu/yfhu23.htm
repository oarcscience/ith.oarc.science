<p>IT is only a few years, not more than a quarter of a century, since modern psychology began to proclaim the new science of human thought and action, so that we have had but a short time to demonstrate what a more intelligent application of our energies and forces can accomplish. But already the evidence is coming in from all sources, revealing results that frequently border upon the extraordinary. Man can do far more with himself and his life than he has been doing in the past; he can call into action, and successfully apply, far more ability, energy and worth than his forefathers ever imagined.</p>  
<p>It is the purpose of these books not only to discuss these greater powers and possibilities in man, but also to present practical methods through which they may be applied, and to encourage as many as possible to study and apply these greater powers within them so that they may not only become greater and richer and more worthy as individuals, but may also become the forerunners of that higher and more wonderful race of which we all have so fondly dreamed.</p>  <h5 align="center">WHAT READERS SAY</h5>

<p>When one undertakes to write something new about an institution so old as marriage, one must, at least, have the courage of one's convictions&#8212;plus something to say. The many readers of the Larson books will be assured at the outset of these two assets. Their chief curiosity will he as to how gently he will deal with this sacred theme. Mr. Larson has taught in all his books that progress is the inevitable law of life, and all that does not progress must be thrust aside. We are not surprised, therefore, to find him stating that "among the many institutions that will be affected directly and immediately by the great changes that are rapidly coming over the world, the institution of marriage is by no means the least important." Again he says, "Marriage today does not measure up to .the new ideals of life; and the modern home, with a few noble exceptions, does not possess those finer elements that alone can lift the race to a higher level of conduct and existence. A decided change, therefore, must come, both in the ideals of the home and in the ideals of the marital state; but we must understand the psychology of sex before we can proceed to bring about the change required." The author, however, is not iconoclastic in the present book. His .criticism is constructive, and as it is presented by a series of logical steps it is hardly fair to make brief excerpts. Instead, the reader is invited to follow for himself the arguments through which the author reaches his "ideal." Whether or not one agrees, the book will provide abundant food for thought.</p>

<p align="center">By CHRISTIAN D. LARSON, author of "Your Forces and How to Use Them," etc. 195 pages, 8vo, net $1.00 (postage extra).</p>  
<p>With his accustomed sane and broad theology, Mr. Larson here presents' a series of talks upon the spiritual life. He is especially interested in the life of the hereafter, which, he points out, is bound up with the now. "The true pathway of life is the eternal path of an endless ascension&#8212;the soul rising ever and ever into higher and higher states of existence. It is the path of wisdom and light, the path of freedom and truth&#8212;the straight and narrow path&#8212;the path leading directly toward the spiritual heights; but it is not a path of suffering. There is neither suffering nor bondage upon this path. It is when we step outside this path that we suffer."</p>  
<p>The author divides his discussion into eighteen chapters: "Leave it to God," "The Highest Prayer," "The Religion of the Soul," "The Secret of Spiritual Power," and "Regions of Infinite Repose," are among suggestive captions. To read the Larson books is to get a refreshing, common-sense view of life's larger questions. He is not concerned with creeds and isms. He pictures the soul as constantly expanding and therefore requiring the broadest limits in its search for the truth. The final life is the spiritual. When, therefore, "the human entity begins to realize that the spiritual side is more real than the physical side, consciousness will begin to function more definitely upon the spiritual side; that is, life will he lived, not from the body, but from the soul; and when we live in the soul, and from the soul, we will give expression to an ever-increasing measure of life. wisdom and power."</p>
