<p>Rheumatic fever and this person's results in working with it interested me greatly.</p>  
<p>"You have observed that little boy from the time he was first brought here," he said, speaking of a child who had just left. "He was lacking in energy and was feverish, especially in his joints. You felt his pulse at the start, pounding, irregular and under strain. It sounded like a valve leak in his heart. That was what they tell me is a typical rheumatic heart.</p>  
<p>"Many children have been brought to me with similar symptoms which revert back to a weak magnetic field from birth, resulting in tension throughout the nervous system including the nerves which control the heart valves and the heart.</p>  
<p>"As you see, when the spasm is relieved from the magnetic field the heart equalizes itself, due to the increased flow of energy through the nervous system, and a charge of energy through the heart valve nerves eliminates the blowing sound. Then the natural flow of energy to these parts keeps the machinery running.</p>  
<p>"It is difficult for me to understand how this could develop from an infection. There was no infection that the family knew of&#151;he had been weak and ailing from birth.</p>  
<p>"Those children usually are the result of a magnetic field depletion in the parents and, as a general</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_99"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 99</FONT></A></p>  
<p>rule, the mother is in extreme tension all during her pregnancy and especially at delivery. The spasm and tension should be relieved from the magnetic field by the generation of human energy before delivery, thus causing an easy birth.</p>  
<p>"Another similar case was that of a child whose brother was spastic from a birth injury. While his mother was carrying the second baby she told me that she was frantic for fear that it might be another spastic. Her fear created tension in her magnetic field causing the baby's magnetic field in turn to be in tension or spasm at birth. Now she is two years old and all these symptoms are showing up, as you see. These symptoms are fever, nerve spasms and heart strain, with a valve starting to weaken. The doctors referred to this case as rheumatic fever to the mother."</p>  
<p>This baby had an over-abundance of nervous activity; it was impossible to keep her still. She was just two years old and as tiny and perfect as a Dresden figure. When I saw her, she wore a miniature blue coat and bonnet and was as darting and as restless as the bluebird she resembled.</p>  
<p>Her mother was alarmed about her and brought her in for treatment. The baby had had a fever of 105&deg; three times in two months. Under doctor's orders she had three series of sulfa drugs. The fever had finally broken, only to return a short time later. The apparent cause was enlarged tonsils, and tonsillectomy was recommended. She was advised to keep her quiet because her heart rate was much too fast, but that had proved an impossibility. The mother is a graduate nurse and was fully aware of the hazards</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_100"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 100</FONT></A></p>  
<p>involved. She brought the baby in before she decided on the tonsillectomy.</p>  
<p>In three treatments most of the baby's artificial pep was gone and her heart rate was slower. She was quieter, relieved of tension, and more willing to play quietly and submit to an afternoon nap. Her fever had subsided and her mother was elated with the results.</p>  
<p>"Don't you think," this person added, "that it would be an advantage to an expectant mother to know whether her magnetic field was supplying the proper energy to the nervous system, thus relieving bloated pressure while carrying, and eliminating considerable stress, excess tension and pain at delivery?"</p>
