<p><em>In this great universe of earth and sky<br />
Strange forces make us mortals do strange things.<br />
Humanity, doped or drugged by laws of man,<br />
Wanders unsatisfied through time and space<br />
Not knowing of the deep magnetic forces<br />
Waiting entrance to the mind.<br />
Oh, human soul, if you will pause<br />
And take the key within your reach<br />
And open up the cupboard of your mind,<br />
There, upon the shelf of common sense,<br />
You will find such great content<br />
That man and mate would never want for more</em>.</p>
