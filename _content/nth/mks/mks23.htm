<p><div style="font-size: 90%">THIS Part tells what the true business of life is and the result. It shows that we can obtain no results as long as we remain oblivious to the only power there is, an understanding of the principles, forces, methods and combinations of mind and its relation to the Universal mind. It explains that the Universal can act only through the Individual; it shows that we are the channel for its activity, that it is within us, that we are it. We can, of course, fail to recognize it and so exclude it from our consciousness, but it will nevertheless be the basic fact of all existence. It tells of inspiration, the art of adjusting the individual mind to that of the Universal, the art of becoming a channel for the flow of Infinite Wisdom.</div></p>  
<p><a name="page_254"><font size="1" color="green">p. 254</font></A></p>  <h4 align="center">INTRODUCTION. PART TWENTY</h4>  
<p>For many years there has been an endless discussion as to the origin of evil. Theologians have told us that God is Love, and that God is Omnipresent. If this be true, there is no place where God is not. Where, then, are Evil, Satan and Hell? Let us see:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">God is Spirit.</p>  
<p>Spirit is the Creative Principle of the Universe.</p>  
<p>Man is made in the image and likeness of God.</p>  
<p>Man is therefore a spiritual being.</p>  
<p>The only activity which spirit possesses is the power to think.</p>  
<p>Thinking is therefore a creative process.</p>  
<p>All form is therefore the result of the thinking process.</p>  
<p>The destruction of form must also be a result of the thinking process.</p>  
<p>Fictitious representations of form are the result of the creative power of thought, as in Hypnotism.</p>  
<p>Apparent representations of form are the result of the creative power of thought, as in Spiritualism.</p>  
<p>Invention, organization and constructive work of all kinds are the result of the creative power of thought, as in concentration.</p>  
<p>When the creative power of thought is manifested for the benefit of humanity, we call the result good.</p>  
<p>When the creative power of thought is manifested in a destructive or evil manner, we call the result evil.</p>  
<p>This indicates the origin of both good and evil; they are simply words which have been coined in order to indicate the nature of the result of the thinking or creative process.</p>  
<p>Thought necessarily precedes and predetermines action; action precedes and predetermines condition.</p>  
<p>Part Twenty will throw more light upon this important subject.</div></p>  
<p><a name="page_255"><font size="1" color="green">p. 255</font></A></p>  <h4 align="center">PART TWENTY</h4>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:1">XX, 1</A></FONT></span>1. The spirit of a thing is that thing; it is necessarily fixed, changeless and eternal. The spirit of you is&#8212;you; without the spirit you would be nothing. It becomes active through your recognition of it and its possibilities.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:2">XX, 2</A></FONT></span>2. You may have all the wealth in Christendom, but unless you recognize it and make use of it, it will have no value; so with your spiritual wealth: unless you recognize it and use it, it will have no value. The one and only condition of spiritual power is use or recognition.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:3">XX, 3</A></FONT></span>3. All great things come through recognition; the sceptre of power is consciousness, and thought is its messenger, and this messenger is constantly moulding the realities of the invisible world into the conditions and environments of your objective world.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:4">XX, 4</A></FONT></span>4. Thinking is the true business of life, power is the result. You are at all times dealing with the magical power of thought and consciousness. What results can you expect so long as you remain oblivious to the power which has been placed within your control?</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:5">XX, 5</A></FONT></span>5. So long as you do this you limit yourself to superficial conditions, and make of yourself a beast of burden for those who think; those who recognize their power; those who know that unless we are willing to think we shall have to work, and the less we think the more we shall have to work, and the less we shall get for our work.</p>  
<p><a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="green">p. 256</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:6">XX, 6</A></FONT></span>6. The secret of power is a perfect understanding of the principles, forces, methods and combinations of Mind, and a perfect understanding of our relationship to the Universal Mind. It is well to remember that this principle is unchangeable; if this were not so, it would not be reliable; all principles are changeless.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:7">XX, 7</A></FONT></span>7. This stability is your opportunity; you are its active attribute, the channel for its activity; the Universal can act only through the individual.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:8">XX, 8</A></FONT></span>8. When you begin to perceive that the essence of the Universal is within yourself&#8212;is you&#8212;you begin to do things; you begin to feel your power; it is the fuel which fires the imagination; which lights the torch of inspiration; which gives vitality to thought; which enables you to connect with all the invisible forces of the Universe. It is this power which will enable you to plan fearlessly, to execute masterfully.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:9">XX, 9</A></FONT></span>9. But perception will come only in the Silence; this seems to be the condition required for all great purposes. You are a visualizing entity. Imagination is your workshop. It is here that your ideal is to be visualized.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:10">XX, 10</A></FONT></span>10. As a perfect understanding of the nature of this power is a primary condition for its manifestation, visualize the entire method over</p>  
<p><a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="green">p. 257</font></A></p>  
<p>and over again, so that you may use it whenever occasion requires. Supreme wisdom is to follow the method whereby we may have the inspiration of the omnipotent Universal Mind on demand at any time.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:11">XX, 11</A></FONT></span>11. We can fail to recognize this world within, and so exclude it from our consciousness, but it will still be the basic fact of all existence; and when we learn to recognize it, not only in ourselves, but in all persons, events, things and circumstances, we shall have found the "Kingdom of Heaven" which we are told is "within" us.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:12">XX, 12</A></FONT></span>12. Our failures are a result of the operation of exactly the same principle; the principle is unchangeable; its operation is exact, there is no deviation; if we think lack, limitation, discord, we shall find their fruits on every hand; if we think poverty, unhappiness or disease, the thought messengers will carry the summons as readily as any other kind of thought and the result will be just as certain. If we fear a coming calamity, we shall be able to say with Job, "the thing I feared has come upon me"; if we think unkindly or ignorantly we shall thus attract to ourselves the results of our ignorance.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:13">XX, 13</A></FONT></span>13. This power of thought, if understood and correctly used, is the greatest labour-saving device ever dreamed of, but if not understood or improperly used, the result will in all probability be disastrous, as we have already seen;</p>  
<p><a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="green">p. 258</font></A></p>  
<p>by the help of this power you can confidently undertake things that are seemingly impossible, because this power is the secret of all inspiration, all genius.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:14">XX, 14</A></FONT></span>14. To become inspired means to get out of the beaten path, out of the rut, because extraordinary results require extraordinary means. When we come into a recognition of the Unity of all things and that the source of all power is within, we tap the source of inspiration.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:15">XX, 15</A></FONT></span>15. Inspiration is the art of imbibing, the art of self-realization; the art of adjusting the individual mind to that of the Universal Mind; the art of attaching the proper mechanism to the source of all power; the art of differentiating the formless into form; the art of becoming a channel for the flow of Infinite Wisdom; the art of visualizing perfection; the art of realizing the omnipresence of Omnipotence.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:16">XX, 16</A></FONT></span>16. An understanding and appreciation of the fact that the infinite power is omnipresent and is therefore in the infinitely small as well as the infinitely large will enable us to absorb its essence; a further understanding of the fact that this power is spirit and therefore indivisible will enable us to appreciate its presence at all points at the same time.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:17">XX, 17</A></FONT></span>17. An understanding of these facts, first intellectually and then emotionally, will enable us to drink deeply from this ocean of infinite</p>  
<p><a name="page_259"><font size="1" color="green">p. 259</font></A></p>  
<p>power. An intellectual understanding will be of no assistance; the emotions must be brought into action; thought without feeling is cold. The required combination is thought and feeling.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:18">XX, 18</A></FONT></span>18. Inspiration is from within. The Silence is necessary, the senses must be stilled, the muscles relaxed, repose cultivated. When you have thus come into possession of a sense of poise and power you will be ready to receive the information or inspiration or wisdom which may be necessary for the development of your purpose.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:19">XX, 19</A></FONT></span>19. Do not confuse these methods with those of the clairvoyant; they have nothing in common. Inspiration is the art of receiving and makes for all that is best in life; your business in life is to understand and command these invisible forces instead of letting them command and rule you. Power implies service; inspiration implies power; to understand and apply the method of inspiration is to become a superman.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:20">XX, 20</A></FONT></span>20. We can live more abundantly every time we breathe, if we consciously breathe with that intention. The IF is a very important condition in this case, as the intention governs the attention, and without the attention you can secure only the results which every one else secures. That is, a supply equal to the demand.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:21">XX, 21</A></FONT></span>21. In order to secure the larger supply</p>  
<p><a name="page_260"><font size="1" color="green">p. 260</font></A></p>  
<p>your demand must be increased, and as you consciously increase the demand the supply will follow, you will find yourself coming into a larger and larger supply of life, energy and vitality.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:22">XX, 22</A></FONT></span>22. The reason for this is not difficult to understand, but it is another of the vital mysteries of life which does not seem to be generally appreciated. If you make it your own you will find it one of the great realities of life.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:23">XX, 23</A></FONT></span>23. We are told that "In Him we live and move and have our being," and we are told that "He" is a Spirit, and again that "He" is Love, so that every time we breathe, we breathe this life, love and spirit. This is Pranic Energy, or Pranic Ether; we could not exist a moment without it. It is the Cosmic Energy; it is the Life of the Solar Plexus.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:24">XX, 24</A></FONT></span>24. Every time we breathe we fill our lungs with air and at the same time vitalize our body with this Pranic Ether which is Life itself, so that we have the opportunity of making a conscious connection with All Life, All Intelligence and All Substance.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:25">XX, 25</A></FONT></span>25. A knowledge of your relation and oneness with this Principle that governs the Universe and the simple method whereby you can consciously identify yourself with it gives you a scientific understanding of a law whereby you may free yourself from disease, from lack or</p>  
<p><a name="page_261"><font size="1" color="green">p. 261</font></A></p>  
<p>limitation of any kind; in fact, it enables you to breathe the "breath of life" into your own nostrils.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:26">XX, 26</A></FONT></span>26. This "breath of life" is a super-conscious reality. It is the essence of the "I am." It is pure "Being" or Universal Substance and our conscious unity with it enables us to localize it, and thus exercise the powers of this creative energy.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:27">XX, 27</A></FONT></span>27. Thought is creative vibration and the quality of the conditions created will depend upon the quality of our thought, because we cannot express powers which we do not possess. We must "be" before we can "do" and we can "do" only to the extent to which we "are," and so what we do will necessarily coincide with what we "are" and what we are depends upon what we "think."</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:28">XX, 28</A></FONT></span>28. Every time you think you start a train of causation which will create a condition in strict accordance with the quality of the thought which originated it. Thought which is in</p>  
<p>harmony with the Universal Mind will result in corresponding conditions. Thought which is destructive or discordant will produce corresponding results. You may use thought constructively or destructively, but the immutable law will not allow you to plant a thought of one kind and reap the fruit of another. You are free to use this marvellous creative power as you will, but you must take the consequences.</p>  
<p><a name="page_262"><font size="1" color="green">p. 262</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:29">XX, 29</A></FONT></span>29. This is the danger from what is called Will Power. There are those who seem to think that by force of will they can coerce this law that they can sow seed of one kind and by "Will Power" make it bear fruit of another, but the fundamental principle of creative power is the Universal, and therefore the idea of forcing a compliance with our wishes by the power of the individual will is an inverted conception, which may appear to succeed for a while but is eventually doomed to failure, because it antagonizes the very power which it is seeking to use.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:30">XX, 30</A></FONT></span>30. It is the individual attempting to coerce the Universal, the finite in conflict with the Infinite. Our permanent well-being will be best conserved by a conscious co-operation with the continuous forward movement of the Great Whole.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_XX:31">XX, 31</A></FONT></span>31. For your next exercise, go into the Silence and concentrate on the fact that "In Him we live and move and have our being" is literally and scientifically exact! That you ARE because He IS, that if He is Omnipresent He must be in you. That if He is all in all you must be in Him! That He is Spirit and you are made in "His image and likeness" and that the only difference between His spirit and your spirit is one of degree, that a part must be the same in kind and quality as the whole. When you can realize this clearly you will have found</p>  
<p><a name="page_263"><font size="1" color="green">p. 263</font></A></p>  
<p>the secret of the creative power of thought, you will have found the origin of both good and evil, you will have found the secret of the wonderful power of concentration, you will have found the key to the solution of every problem whether physical, financial or environmental.</p>
