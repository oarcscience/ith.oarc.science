<P>
This is a short collection of Australian Aborigine folklore, addressed to
a general audience.
The tales and folklore are recounted factually, but the book
reflects the time in which it was written, so the reader should take that into
account.
The author apparently involved with providing aid to Aboriginal people,
according to a relation of Mr. Thomas who wrote me.
Thomas also wrote
