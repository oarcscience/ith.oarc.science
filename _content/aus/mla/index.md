# Some Myths and Legends of the Australian Aborigines

## by W. J. Thomas

#### \[1923\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a short collection of Australian Aborigine folklore, addressed
to a general audience. The tales and folklore are recounted factually,
but the book reflects the time in which it was written, so the reader
should take that into account. The author apparently involved with
providing aid to Aboriginal people, according to a relation of Mr.
Thomas who wrote me. Thomas also wrote [The Welsh Fairy
Book](../../neu/celt/wfb/index).
