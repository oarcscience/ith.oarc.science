## Appendix A. The Names of the Natives

EVERY individual is spoken of as belonging to some particular sub-class
and totem, but in addition to this he has at least two individual names.
The first of these is the personal name in ordinary use which is more or
less frequently used in speaking to or of the individual. The second is
the secret or sacred name. As already described in the chapter dealing
with the Churinga, every individual has a secret name associated with
his or her *Churinga nanja*. If the individual be regarded as the
reincarnation of an ancestor whose spirit part was associated with that
Churinga, then he bears the name of that individual; but it may happen
that the name of the ancestor of whom he is the reincarnation is not
handed down in the traditions, in which case the head man of the local
group to which he belongs decides upon the secret name which is given to
the individual. In any case this secret name which is given to men and
women alike is associated with the Churinga, is spoken of as the
Churinga name, and is only known to the fully initiated men of the local
group. To take an example, every member of the Alice Springs witchetty
grub group has a secret Churinga name which is only known to the fully
initiated men of that local group and is never uttered except during the
solemn ceremonies when the Churinga are examined as described in
connection with the Engwura.

When spéaking to or of a living individual, one of three methods is
adopted. First, the term of relationship (*Okilia, Mia*, etc.), may be
used; second, the ordinary personal name may be used; or third, if the
person addressed be one who has acted in an official capacity during the
initiation of the man who is speaking to him, then <span
id="page_638">p. 638</span> the term applied to him in connection with
this ceremony may be used (for example, *Atwia-atwia* if he performed
the ceremony). This latter term may be spoken of as strictly a term of
address.

Further still, an individual often has what may be called a “nick name,”
arising from some strongly-marked feature in his figure, or from his
fancied resemblance to some animal or plant.

In addition to these names a man has the following, which may be called
“status terms,” applied to him, indicating the stage of initiation which
he has reached; (1) up to the time at which he is thrown up in the air
he is called *Ambaquerka*; (2) up to the time at which he is taken to
the circumcision ground he is called *Ulpmerka*; (3) during the few days
which elapse between his being painted on the circumcision ground and
the actual performance of the ceremony, he is called *Wurtja*; (4)
during the few weeks between the operations of circumcision and
sub-incision he is called *Arakurta*; (5) after circumcision and until
he has passed through the Engwura he is called *Ertwa-kurka*; (6) during
the few weeks in connection with the close of the Engwura ceremony, when
he is sent out into the bush to secure food for the old men and when he
may not paint his body he is called *Ilpongwurra*; (7) after passing
through the Engwurra he is called *Urliara*.

Amongst the women there are only three status terms: (1) up to the time
of the first menstruation period she is called *Ambaquerka*; (2) after
this and until she is fully grown and her breasts hang pendent she is
called *Wunpa*; (3) after that she is called *Arakutja*.

Every man has thus: (1) his sub-class name, (2) his totem name, (3) his
personal name, (4) his secret or Churinga name, (5) probably a
nick-name, (6) his status term, and (7) he may have, if he has acted as
an official during an initiation ceremony, a special term applied to him
by the man who was initiated at that ceremony.

In the following table we give the sub-class and totem of the members of
five families in the Arunta tribe, and also the personal and secret
names of the individuals. In the case of the women it must be remembered
that they never know their secret names.
