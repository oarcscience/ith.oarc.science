<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE ABORIGINES</H1>
<P>I write of those who held this land<BR>
From time as far back as you will-<BR>
To-day a wasted, stricken band.<BR>
But yesterday a stalwart race<BR>
Preserving in the gentle face<BR>
The imprint of God's fingers still.</P>
<P>Ere Ovid's parchment spread the ink<BR>
The tale was legend of the lips Of Perseus.<BR>
And so, I think, 'Tis well to teach the world the lore<BR>
Our aborigines forebore<BR>
To teach--SAVE TO THEMSELVES--AND THEY'RE NOT QUIPS!</P>
<P>But we who've peeped into their hearts<BR>
See there the deep and passioned beat-<BR>
We see how quick a teardrop starts-<BR>
We read the furrows of the brow,<BR>
We know the ache that's with them now,<BR>
We note their dragging, listless feet.</P>
<P>They count their age since life began<BR>
Here, they the embryo at dawn;<BR>
Here lived they when the earth was wan!<BR>
Their age is aeons-is not years!<BR>
And now they're dying of their tears!<BR>
Down in their ashes hear them mourn.</P>
<P>They had no sea-borne argosy,<BR>
They trecked no treck with questing feet-<BR>
Such tales--they are but fantasy!<BR>
Their God was Love-their life was law;<BR>
Diseaseless, happy! Why wish more?<BR>
In purity they had their seat.</P>
<P>Then came white wings that brought them Death.<BR>
They'd lived by love--but Nature saw<BR>
In tune with God--sweet as His breath-<BR>
But now they see who is the Last,<BR>
They know their day has faded fast-<BR>
We lie-'tis Nature's law!</P>
