<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">A ROYAL VISIT</H2>
<P>My office was very small, and very stuffy, though under the floor covering whenever I lifted it up, it was damp and mildewed.</P>
<P>The day was hot and steamy, and before me on the desk was a loose-leaf ledger that simply bristled and screamed with figures.</P>
<P>The headings were such as this: "30 x 5.77 Covers, 710 x 90 Covers, 30 x 31 B.E. Covers, many-figured Tubes," etc., etc., and the columns were serial numbers of tyres containing as many as nine figures.</P>
<P>One figure denoted the year in which the tyres were manufactured, another the month, and intervening figures accounted for wealth of fabric or cord, and other details of tyre-building.</P>
<P>For we were distributors of motor-tyres.</P>
<P>The little half-door between me and the shop gave me a view of the counter; and the shelves, packed with little red bags, were heavy with their goods.</P>
<P>In the little red bags were the inner tubes.</P>
<P>Men came in and went out.</P>
<P>Some took price-lists. Some asked questions only, and then retired.</P>
<P>Some made a purchase and haggled about the discount, and some wanted to see the Chief.</P>
<P>My eyes ached and my head was not altogether free from a feeling like neuralgia.</P>
<P>The mildew, the heat, the figures-all were contributing factors.</P>
<P>Then I heard a voice that made me drop my pen and peer out towards that end of the counter near the door, and just out of my view as I remained seated and at ease.</P>
<P>As near to the outside door as she could stand while yet within the shop-that is the position taken up by the owner of the voice.</P>
<P>And such a voice! Smooth and soft and cushioned!</P>
<P>As velvet is soft to the touch, so this voice is soft to the ear. Perhaps not everyone's ear, but certainly to mine.</P>
<P>My twisting office-chair creaked as I stood up. Stood up to attention as rigidly-hatless and coatless as I was-just as I sprang to it with a click when the General addressed me away over in Palestine.</P>
<P>"Nungurra ilukka," I said.</P>
<P>The owner of the voice-a lady-shy, timid, reserved, refined-turned to me.</P>
<P>"That is the language of my people," she said.</P>
<P>"Come here, please, and speak to me," I said.</P>
<P>Now 1 have heard some people snigger at the walk of those to whom this lady belonged.</P>
<P>It is certainly as different from that of most Sydney people, or any other white people, as the step of a peacock is from the tramp of a camel. It has the qualities of the peacock.</P>
<P>It is soft. It is noiseless. It is dainty.</P>
<P>It takes up its full share of the floor. Every toe finds its level, and the heel is planted as firmly as the supports of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.</P>
<P>As I said before, it is noiseless.</P>
<P>When I had found the lady a seat, and had resumed mine, I asked, "In what part of your country were you born?"</P>
<P>She answered evasively.</P>
<P>It is as natural for her and her people to be evasive as it is for the most shrewd of us to refrain from telling the whole truth when we want to sell a secondhand car or a groggy horse.</P>
<P>"My father," she said, "came from the South and my mother from the North. His language was not the same as my mother's. I speak between the two. My words are both his and hers. Yours are neither. You speak like the people of far, far away. I do not understand you. But I know your words are of my country."</P>
<P>Then she leaned forward and put a hand as soft as her footfall and as soft as her voice, on my shoulder.</P>
<P>She peered into my face and searched me as if she expected to see something she would be afraid of.</P>
<P>But she was not afraid.</P>
<P>"Excuse me putting my hand on your shoulder," she said. "Perhaps I have no right to do it. But I know now you do not mind, and you will understand."</P>
<P>Then her lips quivered and her eyes filled.</P>
<P>She leaned forward.</P>
<P>"You know my people?"</P>
<P>She questioned me.</P>
<P>Yet it was not really a question. It was a statement of fact.</P>
<P>"Yes," I said, "I know your people!"</P>
<P>Then she overflowed.</P>
<P>"And aren't they GOOD people?"</P>
<P>It was an unburdening! It was a cry!</P>
<P>"Yes," I said. "They ARE good people!"</P>
<P>Then she removed her hat.</P>
<P>Her hair is white and old.</P>
<P>"My father was a King. I am a Princess. My blood is royal!"</P>
<P>"And where was your father a King?"</P>
<P>"He was a King of his people, and they lived around Wollongong. I am a native of the Wollongong district-born at Unanderra!"</P>
<P>"Was your father ever crowned?" I asked.</P>
<P>"Yes," she said, "when I was a grown girl-a young woman-he was crowned by the white people at a Wollongong Show. They gave him the title of 'King Mickey!'"</P>
<P>Then I saw a picture of my tiny boyhood.</P>
<P>In the Show ring, just after the high-jumping contest was decided, a black man was taken by the hand by a Wollongong dignitary and led to a small dais.</P>
<P>Some ceremony was enacted, but I was too small and too young to understand.</P>
<P>I saw that black man invested with something, and the people cheered and the black man shouted and waved his hands, and he had a string round his neck, and a brass crescent hung over his broad hairy chest.</P>
<P>"I saw your father crowned," I said, "and since then I have seen many of your people. They are GOOD people."</P>
<P>I bowed my royal visitor out.</P>
<P>She carried an inscribed copy of a little book about her folk.</P>
<P>"My grandchildren will read it to me," she said, "and I will come back one day, and I will tell you some more of our stories-stories we do not tell excepting to our own people. But I will tell them to you!"</P>
<P>"This," I said, "is a Royal visit."</P>
<P>She paused.</P>
<P>"Your people came here and took our country," she said very quietly, "but just a few of you understand us. I go now to Wollongong." My Royal visitor has been back to my office.</P>
