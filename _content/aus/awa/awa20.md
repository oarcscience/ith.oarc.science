### Conclusion

In concluding these remarks on the West Australian Aborigines, I would
say a few words to English folk who flatter themselves that they belong
to a higher order of created beings than the Western Australian
Aborigines, who have been represented as mere baboons possessing an
innate and incurable deficiency of intellect, rendering them incapable
of instruction or civilization. Let them reflect that a similar opinion
was one time held by the cultured Romans concerning the Aborigines of
Great Britain. Cicero, in one of his epistles to Atticus, thus refers to
our ancestors:--

"Do not," says he, "obtain your slaves from Britain, because they are so
stupid and utterly incapable of being taught, that they are not fit to
form a part of the household of Atticus."
