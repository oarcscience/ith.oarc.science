Blest and beloved ones of &Abdu'l-Baha!  
 
     To have been unable, owing to sad circumstances over 
which I have had no control, to keep in close and constant 
touch with you, the beloved children of &Abdu'l-Baha, since 
His passing from this world, is to me a cause of sad surprise 
and deep and bitter regret.  To say that ever since the Dawn 
of a New Day has broken upon me I have in the least felt 
reluctant or disinclined to enter into relationship with every 
one of you, or felt indifferent to a Cause which is so close 
and dear to your hearts, would indeed betray every 
sentiment of love and fellowship which animates every one 
of us in our servitude to His Holy Threshold.  It was rather 
my utter exhaustion, my profound feelings of sorrow, the 
overwhelming sense of my own position and responsibilities 
and the extreme pressure of work that have caused me to 
maintain such a long silence and seem forgetful of those 
brave and valiant lovers of the Master in that land.  
     Of the thoughts that sustained and comforted me during 
my hours of restful retirement was the realization, never 
dismissed from my mind, that in the German friends the 
Master will surely find loyal and grateful children who will 
repay the tender love and paternal care which He had for 
them with a devotion and service, so profound and lasting 
that will prove worthy of the many blessings that have been 
theirs in the past.  
     The news of your most spiritual gatherings, since the 
Great Plan of the Master as revealed in His Testament has 
been unfolded to our eyes; the formation and functioning of 
the National Body with efficiency and harmony; the 
extension of your activities; the widening of your 
 
+P8 
correspondence; the generous and spontaneous help you 
have extended us in connection with our difficulties in the 
Holy Land and above all the spirit of ready devotion and 
ever-increasing zeal which is back of it all--these are sweet 
thoughts that cheer the bereaved Ladies of the Holy 
Household and encourage here and abroad the many friends 
who look forward to the hour when all the Master has 
promised His friends in Germany will come to be fulfilled.  
     Having returned to the Holy Land with a renewed vigour 
and a refreshed spirit, I shall not fail with the help of the 
Master to do my part in enabling you to carry on further 
and still further the Glorious Standard of &Baha to the very 
heart and uttermost confines of Germany and thus hasten 
the Day when the Spirit of Faith and Peace as revealed in the 
Cause of &Baha'u'llah will fill the world and the darkness of 
strife be no more.  
     In sweet remembrance at the Three Holy Shrines of your 
labours of love for His Cause, I am and remain your brother 
and coworker in His service.  
 
 
19 January 1923 
 
The beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful 
throughout Germany, 
Care of the members of the National Spiritual Assembly.  
 
My dearly-beloved friends!  
     Ever since I have resumed my work in the Holy Land I 
have been awaiting with eager and particular interest the 
detailed letters, individual as well as collective, of my loved 
 
+P9 
ones in Germany, who, I am sure are arduously, devotedly 
and efficiently carrying on the Great Work which the 
Master has destined for them in this world.  
     Much as I desire to correspond individually with every 
one of you, yet I find that in view of the marvellously rapid 
extension of the Movement all over the world to start and 
maintain individual correspondence with the vast and ever-increasing 
number of &Baha'is in the East and the West 
would entail so much time and energy on my part as to 
prevent me from paying adequate attention to my other 
duties that are so urgent and vital in these days.  
     I shall therefore very regretfully and reluctantly have to 
content myself with direct correspondence with every &Baha'i 
group in each locality, be it a city or hamlet, keeping in 
constant touch with them directly and through their 
respective local assemblies and co-ordinating their spiritual 
efforts and activities through the National Spiritual 
Assembly (National Body), representative of all the 
believers and local assemblies throughout the land.  
     I am exceedingly anxious, as a preliminary to the faithful 
execution of this plan, to receive as soon as it is convenient 
an official, comprehensive and detailed report from the 
National Spiritual Assembly, stating accurately the actual 
standing of the Cause in Germany, describing the progress 
of the activities of the friends throughout that land and the 
adjoining countries such as Austria and Northern 
Switzerland, and setting forth the names, the numerical 
strength, the history, the needs and the activities of every 
locality throughout these regions, however small in size, 
where the Light of the Cause has so far been able to 
penetrate.  
     I hope by this measure to enter into direct and constant 
communication with every locality, however small it may 
 
+P10 
be, where a single friend or more is striving to teach the 
Cause and establish a &Baha'i centre.  
     It has been my great pleasure to read some of the letters 
addressed during the past months by the German friends to 
the Greatest Holy Leaf, and their perusal, I assure you, has 
filled me with intense satisfaction and made me still more 
confident of that glorious era of spiritual reawakening 
which the unseen Hand of our Master is sure to unfold to 
our eyes in the near future.  
     Your labours are unceasing, your effort knows no 
bounds, your devotion and selflessness are indeed worthy of 
the many blessings our Beloved has bestowed upon you and 
the Guidance of &Baha'u'llah and His unfailing assistance 
will, I am certain, enable you to crown your ceaseless 
endeavours with glorious and well-deserved success.  
     In my hours of prayer and meditation, I remember you 
most tenderly and beseech every time I visit the Sacred 
Shrines a fresh outpouring of His Grace and Spirit upon 
your efforts for the spread and triumph of His Cause.  
     As I was the other day studying various &Baha'i documents 
I came across a most inspiring and encouraging message 
from our Beloved written in his own handwriting and 
bearing no date and sign as to the place and circumstances 
in which it was revealed.  I enclose a copy of its translation 
together with various &Baha'i prayers and Tablets all of 
which I trust will be of great help and assistance to you in 
your work of service to the Cause.  I submit them all to the 
members of the National Spiritual Assembly for translation 
into German and circulation among the friends.  
     I have asked a very experienced Persian teacher, by the 
name of &Jinab-i-Avarih, who is at present in England, to pay 
a special visit to the various &Baha'i centres in Germany and 
endeavour with the hearty cooperation of every one of you 
 
+P11 
to arouse deep and widespread interest in the Movement 
throughout that land.  
     I am eagerly anxious to receive a copy of your &Baha'i 
organ which I trust you will be able to publish both in 
German and in English and which I hope will truly and fully 
describe the great effort which is now being made in those 
regions for the diffusion of the &Baha'i principles and 
teachings.  With the introduction of an English section into 
your &Baha'i Magazine the number of its subscribers will I 
am sure greatly increase as the many friends in America, 
Great Britain, France, India and Egypt would be most 
pleased and grateful to gather from its columns the full news 
of the onward march of the Cause throughout Central 
Europe.  
     It would be a great encouragement to the friends in 
America and India if the German friends would through 
their respective assemblies subscribe to the two leading 
&Baha'i organs in the world, namely the Star of the West and 
the &Baha'i News, and contribute regularly reports of their 
own activities and submit for publication carefully written 
articles, sanctioned by the members of the National 
Spiritual Assembly, and bearing upon spiritual matters in 
general, that the East and the West may be closely linked 
together and the friends the world over may know of one 
anothers activities and services to the Cause.  
     The time is sure to come and the signs are already 
apparent, when the various and distant members of this 
great world community will find their activities co-ordinated, 
their purpose unified, their efforts re-inforced 
and the effect of their combined efforts manifest throughout 
the world.  May the Power of &Baha'u'llah breathe the 
dynamic spirit of Life into the combined and systematized 
efforts of the friends the world over and revive through 
 
+P12 
them the body of stricken humanity and give it the peace 
which it yearns for and which the world cannot give.  
                                     Your devoted brother 
 
 
16 February 1923 
 
The beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful 
throughout Germany, 
Care of the members of the National Spiritual Assembly.  
 
My dearest brethren and sisters in &Abdu'l-Baha!  
     I have received with mixed feelings of sadness and 
gratitude your longexpected letter, sent on behalf of the 
National Spiritual Assembly (National Body), and written 
by our sincere and devoted brother Consul Schwarz.  It 
made me feel relieved and grateful at receiving at last the 
news of your safety and the assurance of your unwavering 
determination to serve with heart and soul and to the very 
end the Cause of &Baha'u'llah; and it filled me with sorrow to 
hear of the grievous calamity that has befallen your land and 
the hardships that are afflicting your country.  
     Let me assure you, at the outset, of the deep sympathy of 
the Ladies of the Household, of the friends the world over, 
and of myself, in your great suffering, and our unfailing 
prayers to &Abdu'l-Baha, that He may dissipate these 
gathering clouds of animosity and strife, and relieve your 
great and beloved country from its present state of 
uncertainty and peril.  
     Why fear and sorrow?  Have we not the express promise 
of the Master, uttered after the termination of the Great 
 
+P13 
War, that Germany, now humbled and weakened, will no 
doubt be freed from its fetters and will develop, materially 
and spiritually, and shall one day emerge from this sad 
turmoil strong, united and prosperous, ready to take her 
place in the great Family of the advanced nations of the 
world?  
     I am enclosing for you all my translation of a number of 
selections from the Master's soul-stirring and comforting 
words, revealed some twentyfive years ago, and during the 
darkest days of his incarceration in the prison-city of &Akka.  
You will I hope translate them and publish them in your 
&Baha'i organ the "Sun of Truth", copies of which I shall be 
most pleased to receive and share with my friends in the 
Holy Land.  
     I am enclosing also a copy of my last letter to you, 
wherein I have asked you, among other things, to send me a 
detailed report of your activities, and I sincerely hope that I 
shall soon be in receipt of a detailed answer from you on all 
the points which I have raised in my last letter.  
     I am also enclosing my revised translation of the Hidden 
Words of &Baha'u'llah, both Arabic and Persian, and hope to 
send you more of His Words and Teachings in future.  
     Awaiting your news, and wishing you the highest success 
in your glorious work of service, 
                                     I am your devoted brother 
 
+P14 
4 December 1923 
 
To the dearly-beloved friends throughout Germany.  
Care of the National Spiritual Assembly 
 
My well-beloved friends:  
     What a joy to correspond with you again, and express, 
after a long and unbroken silence, my warm sentiments of 
love and affection for those tried, yet steadfast, lovers of 
&Abdu'l-Baha!  Your trials and sufferings have been a 
constant source of anxiety and painful sorrow, not to me 
alone, but to the Ladies of the Household as well as to the 
friends at large.  
     True, humanity is to-day widely afflicted with 
unprecedented ills and calamities, but you, the chosen and 
favoured children of &Abdu'l-Baha, have, by some wisdom 
inscrutable to us all, received the fullest measure of this 
distress, and are carrying the burden of your cares with 
heroic fortitude, unflinching faith, and undaunted courage 
worthy of the admiration of even the most severely tried of 
your fellow-sufferers in far-away Persia.  
     Your only consolation lies in the ever-living words of our 
departed Master, who confidently declared that the days are 
not far distant when Germany, will shake off her present 
humiliation, and will emerge, mighty, united and glorious, 
not only to take her destined place in the councils of 
nations, but to raise high the triumphant banner of the 
Cause in the very heart of Europe.  
     Your ceaseless activities since His departure from our 
midst have been steadily extended as your tribulations and 
anxieties have multiplied, and I feel hopeful that ere long the 
true Faith of God will blaze worth in that land, and will 
 
+P15 
herald publicly the Message of Salvation to that distracted 
continent.  
     I am so desirous to receive from the National Spiritual 
Assembly, frequent, comprehensive and up-to-date reports 
on the present position of the Cause throughout Germany, 
with an account of the activities of the various &Baha'i centers 
recently established throughout that land.  
     Your &Baha'i Magazine, I have regularly received and read 
with deep interest.  I strongly urge you to devote a section of 
it, written both in German and English, to an account of the 
current activities of the Movement throughout the length 
and breadth of Germany, a step which I am sure will rejoice 
the hearts of our spiritual brethren and sisters the world 
over.  
     The members of the holy Family and myself have joined 
lately the resident friends in the Holy Land in contributing 
towards the relief of the present distress in Germany, and 
we trust our modest efforts will mitigate to some extent the 
rigours of this coming winter in that afflicted country.  
     Hoping to hear from you, individually and collectively, 
and remembering you always in my prayers, 
                                I am your brother and co-worker 
 
 
28 December 1923 
 
To the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the 
Merciful in Leipzig, Germany, 
Care of his honour, Mr. Herrigel.  
 
+P16 
My dearest brethren and sisters in &Abdu'l-Baha:  
     I need not emphasize the deep and genuine pleasure I felt 
when I received and read your most welcome letter dated 
November 11th. 1923.  With what pride and gratitude I 
learned from it that already, through the ever-present and 
omnipotent spirit of our departed Master a fresh start has 
been made and a promising center established in that 
beautiful city of yours, one of the leading centres of thought 
in your beloved country.  
     True, your fatherland is now fallen a prey to chaotic 
conditions and severe distress, yet in this hour of trial and 
suffering we should all remember the inspired words of our 
Beloved who, more than once, declared that out of this 
humiliating turmoil Germany is sure to rise again, united 
and mighty, ready to render her services, spiritual as well as 
material, to the cause of mankind.  
     Let these words cheer us, let them sustain us with hope 
and confidence, and inspire us to serve His Cause and 
spread His Message, however trying the conditions may be.  
     I await lovingly and eagerly your letters, individually as 
well as collectively, and will be delighted to hear of the 
progress of your activities, of the full account of your 
meetings, and of your plans for the promotion of the &Baha'i 
Movement.  
     May His spirit, amid these trying circumstances and 
vicissitudes of your domestic life, sustain you and guide you 
in rendering distinct services to our beloved Cause.  
     Assuring you of my earnest prayers on your behalf, 
                              I am your brother in His love 
 
+P17 
31 December 1923 
 
The beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful 
in Hamburg, Gera, Schwerin, Rostock and &Warnemunde.  
 
My dearly-beloved brethren and sisters in the love of God!  
     The letter of our beloved and highly-esteemed fellow-worker, 
Dr. Grossmann, together with the enclosed &Baha'i 
leaflets and reports, as well as the most welcome and 
encouraging circular letters sent out by the Hamburg and 
Gera &Baha'i Assemblies, have all been received and read 
with pride and gratitude.  So unexpected were these 
messages that were conveyed to us from those uttermost 
corners of Germany, and so beautiful their spirit, that we all 
felt at once surprised, gladdened and inspired.  How 
wondrous, how all-conquering is the Spirit of our beloved 
Master which, despite the terrible distress now reigning all 
over Germany, and notwithstanding the confusion and the 
gross materialism in which mankind is now sunk, is causing 
these vigorous, radiant and hopeful &Baha'i centres to be 
established, linked together and strengthened, in even the 
uttermost regions of your great country.  
     I have shared all your news with the friends in the Holy 
Land, and will forward them to all the &Baha'i centres 
throughout the East, that the friends of &Abdu'l-Baha may 
realize more deeply than ever how His promise is being 
fulfilled.  The Haifa Spiritual Assembly will soon send you a 
special message acknowledging the receipt of your circular 
letters and will be glad to share your news with the friends 
throughout the East and the West.  
     Germany is at present in the throes of unprecedented 
afflictions, and the immediate future may seem still dark 
and disquieting, yet we, who follow in the Master's 
 
+P18 
footsteps will ever bear in mind His sure and emphatic 
promise that your fatherland's present plight will erelong be 
turned into a material prosperity and a spiritual 
regeneration more glorious than ever before, and will offer 
to the eyes of the world a vast, rich, and ready field for the 
propagation of the &Baha'i principles.  
     Let us then take heart, and endeavour to deepen in spirit, 
to reinforce our numbers, so that, however depressing and 
distracting the conditions around us may be, we may 
persevere, with clear vision, steadfast hope, and united 
effort to achieve the triumph of the &Baha'i Revelation 
throughout the world.  
     I am eagerly awaiting every news you may wish to send 
me, for I thirst after the glad tidings of the progress of the 
Cause in your mighty and promising land.  
                                     Your fellow-worker, 
                                                  Shoghi 
 
 
27 November 1924 
 
To my dearly-beloved brothers and sisters in &Abdu'l-Baha.  
 
My most precious brothers and sisters in the love of God!  
     Your most welcome letter bearing the signatures of those 
who have attended your Annual &Baha'i Congress recently 
held in Stuttgart filled my heart with a joy that I cannot 
express.  As I read it over and over again I could feel from 
every word, nay every syllable, of that soul-stirring message 
of yours the promised quickening power of the Word of 
&Baha'u'llah and the love of &Abdu'l-Baha which will, in time, 
 
+P19 
I am certain, achieve the most far-reaching transformation 
throughout Germany.  
     Your great and promising country, dear to you all, blest 
by &Abdu'l-Baha's sacred feet, and the object of the hope and 
affection of &Baha'is in every land, is in a most startling 
manner rising phoenix-like from the ashes of humiliation 
and despair, determined now to raise aloft victoriously and 
serene the Standard of &Baha'u'llah and with His love set all 
the world aflame.  
     From the reports of the marvellous progress of your work 
leading to the establishment of an ever-increasing number of 
&Baha'i Centres and Assemblies in the North, South and 
Center of Germany I can well realize how faithful and loyal 
you have been to the last wishes of our departed Master, 
how the showers of His promised help have rained upon 
you, how gloriously triumphant you must feel now that the 
hour of a re-awakened Germany has struck.  I should be so 
pleased to receive a general and up-to-date report on the 
present activities, position, and strength of the Cause in 
Germany together with a list of the various &Baha'i centres 
recently established.  
     Persevere in your task, redouble your efforts, spread on to 
the remotest corners of your vast and mighty land, 
approach fearlessly both the high and the low, infuse deeper 
and deeper the &Baha'i Spirit into every heart, and do not for 
a moment relax till all your land may from end to end throb 
with the joy of the recognition of this Most Great Cause.  
     Behold what &Abdu'l-Baha saith:  "The triumphant hosts 
of the Celestial Concourse, arrayed and marshalled in the 
Realms above, stand ready and expectant to assist and 
assure victory to that valiant horseman who with confidence 
spurs on his charger into the arena of service.  Well is it with 
that fearless warrior, who armed with the power of true 
 
+P20 
knowledge hastens unto the field, disperses the armies of 
ignorance, and scatters the hosts of error, who holds aloft 
the Standard of Divine Guidance, and sounds the Clarion of 
Victory..."  
     Be assured my dearest friends of my unfailing prayers.  
On this day when with bleeding hearts we commemorate 
the passing of our beloved &Abdu'l-Baha we remember you 
most tenderly, we pray for your success at His Holy shrine, 
and feel confident that you will soon achieve the greatest 
victory.  
                        Awaiting eagerly your joyful news, 
                                         Your true brother 
 
 
2 February 1925 
 
To my well-beloved &Baha'i brethren and sisters throughout 
Germany.  
Care of the German National Spiritual Assembly.  
 
Loyal and capable children of our beloved &Abdu'l-Baha!  
     I have received with the greatest pleasure from the 
National Spiritual Assembly, through our dearly-beloved 
Consul Schwarz, the report of your activities that reflect so 
vividly the unquenchable spirit of love and self-sacrifice 
which animates you in your service for the Beloved's Cause.  
Your unremitting labours are worthy of the highest praise, 
the success you have so far achieved is well deserved.  The 
refreshing vitality of your work, the unity of purpose and 
the concerted action attained recently by your fast-growing 
community are resplendent features of your activity.  They 
 
+P21 
continually remind us of the Master's intense love for you, 
His high hopes in you, His often expressed admiration for 
the ardent devotion, the unquestioned sincerity, the 
unrivalled capacity of His loved ones in Germany.  By what 
you have already accomplished, and by what you are 
determined to achieve in times to come, you have merited 
His abundant blessings and proved in the highest sense 
worthy of the unsurpassed affection He had for you.  
     The signs of the promised revival of your sorely-tried 
Fatherland can now be easily discerned.  In material 
prosperity it is steadily advancing, its power and worldly 
prestige are being fast regained, and above all the dawn of a 
spiritual awakening, unparalleled in your history, seems at 
last to have broken upon it.  His sure and often repeated 
promise will erelong be fulfilled.  
     Let your National Assembly, therefore, redouble its 
efforts, inaugurate a fresh campaign of ever-expanding 
activity, and make a solemn determination not to relax till 
their one aim is attained.  Let them, with the full and 
sustained support, moral as well as financial, of the vast 
company of the believers throughout your land, send forth 
their teachers far and wide, that they may scatter to the very 
confines of Germany and endeavour by every intelligent and 
effective method to lend a fresh impetus to the newly-established 
centres, add to their number, satisfy their needs 
and coordinate their efforts.  
     Let him who desires to hasten the advent of the day when 
all Germany will waken to the recognition of this one 
Message of Universal Salvation arise to contribute his share 
to the work, so gloriously begun, so effectively pursued.  Let 
him by his written and spoken word, in private as well as in 
public, in the course of his travels and in his association 
with all sorts and conditions of men teach the Cause of God 
 
+P22 
with purity of heart, with unflinching determination and 
complete understanding.  
     I assure you, dear friends, we shall all remember you most 
tenderly, most affectionately, whenever we visit the Three 
Holy Shrines.  We will supplicate for you the aid and 
assistance from on high.  We will implore Him Who loved 
you most dearly to bless you even more richly than before, 
shield you from the malice of the ungodly, bind you closer 
one to the other, deepen your faith, clarify your vision, 
widen the scope of your activities, and reinforce your noble 
endeavours.  
     We all love you, we all pray for you, we all await the 
joyful tidings of your land.  
                                        Your true brother 
 
 
7 March 1925 
 
To the beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the 
Merciful in Vienna.  
 
My dearly-beloved brothers and sisters in &Abdu'l-Baha!  
     Your joint letter dated February 13th. 1925 has rejoiced 
my heart and has served to deepen my admiration for the 
splendid efforts displayed by your spiritual teacher, our 
never to be forgotten &Baha'i brother Mr. Herrigel.  As I read 
the full list of your beloved names, I could not but feel a 
thrill of joy and gratitude for the manifold blessings of our 
departed Master who has graciously called upon you and 
chosen you to carry on the great work to which He 
dedicated His whole life.  It is indeed a great privilege for 
 
+P23 
you all to be able to labour in this Divine Vineyard, and to 
lay down the basis of the spiritual as well as the material 
development of your ancient and beloved country.  
     I shall be so glad to receive frequent and detailed reports 
on the progress of your activities individually and 
collectively, and assure you of my ardent desire to help you 
in any way I can for the expansion and advancement of your 
work.  
     Persevere in your task, endeavour by every means at your 
disposal to add to your numbers, study profoundly the 
Writings of &Baha'u'llah and &Abdu'l-Baha, devote a special 
attention to the proper education of your children, and arise 
to start and maintain constant correspondence with the 
various &Baha'i centres throughout the East and the West.  Be 
assured of the emphatic never-failing promise of our dear 
Master that whoso ariseth to deliver this Message with 
purity of heart and sincerity of purpose the hosts of the 
Supreme Concourse will enable him to achieve in a short 
period of time what all the nations of the world combined 
can never accomplish.  
     I will specially pray for you at the Three Holy Shrines that 
the All-Bountiful may bless richly your efforts, that the 
seeds sown by our Beloved in Vienna may germinate 
through your persevering efforts and usher in the era of true 
felicity and peace for your sorely-tried and illustrious 
fatherland.  
     Awaiting eagerly the glad-tidings of the progress of your 
work, and assuring you of my brotherly love, 
                                     I am your true brother 
 
+P24 
27 May 1925 
 
The beloved of the Lord and the handmaids of the Merciful 
throughout Germany.  
 
My dearly-beloved friends:  
     Our well-beloved brother and fellow-worker Dr. 
Esslemont acting on medical advice is proceeding to the 
Black Forest for treatment and recuperation.  He has been 
suffering of late from ill-health which has interfered with the 
unique and most valuable work he has been doing in Haifa.  
His past services, his selflessness and devotion, his book of 
unsurpassed excellence, his noble character and great 
industry entitle him to the highest esteem and warmest 
affection of every true &Baha'i.  
     He has been advised to spend the hot summer months in a 
dry and cool climate and to secure proper medical treatment 
in a quiet and restful place.  I am sure that the German 
friends who have already learned to love and admire such a 
precious and capable servant of the Cause will do all in their 
power to extend to him every facility and ensure his full and 
speedy recovery.  
     He will be accompanied by our dear &Baha'i sister, Mrs. 
Lowell, who is returning to America via Germany and 
whom you will be glad to welcome in your midst.  
                     Assuring you of my affection and prayers, 
                              I am your brother in His service

To the esteemed editor of the "La Nova Tago", the 
International &Baha'i Esperanto Gazette 
 
My dear fellow-worker:  
     It has given me the greatest pleasure to receive the first 
issues of the &Baha'i Esperanto Gazette, and to learn of the 
splendid start you have made along a path which I am 
certain will lead you ultimately to glorious and abiding 
success.  
     I hail the inauguration of an international &Baha'i Organ, 
so vitally needed at the present stage of our work, and 
destined to render services that are unique in their character 
to the component parts of the ever-expanding &Baha'i world.  
     Though limited in its sphere of influence, and modest in 
features, yet it shall, due to the vital position it fulfills, grow 
from strength to strength and vindicate its claim as the one 
medium of international &Baha'i intercourse.  That it may 
achieve this purpose, it is incumbent upon those who are 
responsible for its publication and development to devise 
ways and means for the establishment and maintenance of 
regular and frequent communications with the various 
&Baha'i National Spiritual Assemblies, that in time this 
promising Magazine may faithfully portray with force and 
beauty the diverse achievements of &Baha'i communities 
throughout the world.  
     I assure you of my deepest interest in this fresh field of 
&Baha'i enterprise, and of my great desire to promote in such 
parts of the &Baha'i world as present circumstances permit 
the study of an international language which is of such an 
 
+P26 
obvious and practical utility to our steadily advancing 
Cause.  
                   May &Abdu'l-Baha bless richly your efforts, 
                                Your brother and fellow-worker 
 
 
5 November 1925 
 
To my dearly-beloved brothers and sisters in &Abdu'l-Baha 
the members of the National Spiritual Assembly, 
Care of the Secretary, Mrs. Consul Schwarz, Stuttgart, 
Germany.  
 
My dear fellow-workers:  
     It is always a great pleasure to us all to receive from the 
German National Spiritual Assembly, in whose members we 
have the greatest hopes, detailed and frequent reports 
regarding the work entrusted to their charge.  I shall always 
welcome with the greatest joy and satisfaction any 
suggestions you may wish to offer, would be gratified to 
share in the study of your plans, in the consideration of your 
manifold difficulties and problems as well as in the joy of 
your individual as well as collective accomplishments.  I 
therefore earnestly request you to inform me as regularly 
and as frequently as possible of the various features of your 
work, of the plans and schemes which you have in mind, of 
the various obstacles in your path, and of whatever is 
needed to ensure the peaceful and steady progress of your 
work and the consolidation of your devoted labours.  
 
+P27 
     An active, united, and harmonious National Spiritual 
Assembly, properly and conscientiously elected, vigorously 
functioning, alert and conscious of its many and pressing 
responsibilities, in close and continuous contact with the 
international center in the Holy Land, and keenly watchful 
of every development throughout the length and breadth of 
its ever-expanding field of work--is surely in this day of 
urgent necessity and paramount importance, for it is the 
corner-stone on which the edifice of Divine administration 
must ultimately rest.  It is my hope and prayer that the ever-watchful 
Spirit of &Abdu'l-Baha will guide, reinforce, and 
bless your unceasing and unsparing efforts, and crown with 
brilliant success the services which His well-beloved and 
loyal German friends are rendering to His Cause.  
     I am enclosing a general letter of appeal addressed to the 
declared believers throughout the &Baha'i world, acquainting 
them with the present situation of the land in close 
proximity to the Shrines of Mount Carmel and urging them 
to do all in their power to safeguard for the future the 
surroundings of this cherished and sacred Spot.  
     I am also enclosing a copy of the list of transliterated 
terms commonly used in &Baha'i Literature, and ask you to 
distribute them throughout the various &Baha'i centres in 
Germany and Austria, that the friends the world over may 
adopt in their writings one common, authoritative, and 
uniform system of spelling and thus avoid inevitable 
confusion in future.  
     I have already acquainted you by cable of the sad and 
grave situation in &Baghdad in connection with the House of 
&Baha'u'llah, wherein He passed the greater part of His 
sojourn in &Iraq, which He explicitly designated as sacred, 
object of &Baha'i veneration and pilgrimage, and of the future 
of which He spoke and wrote with glowing praise and 
 
+P28 
majestic confidence.  I am certain that every true believer in 
Germany and Austria, conscious of the gravity of the 
present situation, will after due consultation and 
deliberation, do all in his power to safeguard such an 
infinitely precious and sacred edifice.  
     The publication of "La Nova Tago" the first International 
Esperanto Gazette, has given me genuine and deep 
satisfaction and I trust that this promising Magazine, 
properly directed and nurtured, will achieve great things for 
the Cause in future.  I strongly urge you to support it, guide 
it and direct it along the most profitable channels, and make 
of it in time a true mirror reflecting the world-wide activities 
of the &Baha'i Cause.  May it achieve its great and laudable 
purpose!  
     In my hours of prayer and meditation at the three holy 
Shrines, I particularly and most tenderly remember my 
unforgettable German friends, in whose ability, ardour, 
thoroughness, sagacity and constancy our Beloved had the 
greatest belief and confidence, of whose land He spoke so 
highly, and on whom He lavished His lovingkindness and 
blessings.  We follow your present activities with no less 
admiration and affection, and feel certain that you are 
destined to play your part in securing the ultimate and 
universal recognition of the &Baha'i Faith.  
     Awaiting eagerly your individual and collective letters, 
and assuring you of my undiminished affection, 
                   I am your true brother and fellow-worker

The beloved of God and the handmaids of the Merciful in 
Dresden. c/o Mr. Herrigel.  
 
My Dearly-beloved friends:  
     I have learned with feelings of gratitude and satisfaction, 
the welcome news conveyed in Mr. Herrigel's letter 
regarding the establishment of a &Baha'i centre in Dresden.  I 
hasten to offer you in the name of all &Baha'is the expression 
of our warmest welcome, and our best wishes for the 
expansion, and the consolidation of your newly-established 
centre.  
     The efforts of our indefatigable and self-sacrificing 
brother, Mr. Herrigel, have at last yielded the promised 
fruit, and we feel confident, that by the unfailing assistance 
of the power of &Baha'u'llah, and the fostering care of our 
dear brother, your numbers will increase, your knowledge 
of this Most Great Cause deepen, and your opportunities for 
the service of mankind in accordance with the Sublime 
principles of &Baha'u'llah multiply.  
     I assure you, one and all, of my keen interest in your 
work, your plans and hopes for the future and of my fervent 
prayers for your happiness, success and welfare whenever I 
visit the Holy Shrines.  
     I trust and pray that some day we shall meet face to face 
in Haifa, and visit together the various historic sites, that 
have been hallowed by footsteps of &Baha'u'llah and &Abdu'l-Baha.  
     I urge you to take up earnestly the study of the &Baha'i 
history and teachings, and to read most carefully such parts 
of Dr. Esselmont's book as have been already translated 
into German.  
 
+P30 
     Wishing you success from all my heart, and assuring you 
again of our hearty welcome to the &Abha fold, 
                           I am your brother and well-wisher 
                                                      Shoghi 
 
 
1 April 1926 
 
Dear spiritual brothers and sisters:  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of 
your letter dated &Baha, 1, 83.  He always looks with great 
expectation to the news of the progress of the Cause in 
Germany.  That country together with the other states of 
central Europe have come out of the war, and the later 
developments of the political conditions almost ruined.  
They all feel the need for some new spirit which will pull the 
world out of the morass it is in.  If the teachings of the Cause 
be properly set forth, if its solution of the social problems be 
clearly expounded, the people will undoubtedly grasp its 
significance and further its progress.  
     Shoghi Effendi prays to God that you may all be guided in 
your services so that the hopes of the Master may be realized 
in Germany even before it was expected.  
     There is no especial news here in Haifa.  Pilgrims are 
coming and going, taking with them the beautiful spirit they 
obtain at the Blessed Shrines.  
     All the members of the family are well and eagerly await 
the news of your success....  
 
          [From the Guardian:]
My dear co-workers:  
     Your letter has greatly encouraged me in my work.  I have 
great hopes in your future work and am deeply grateful for 
 
+P31 
what you have already achieved.  I will remember you in my 
prayers at the Beloved's Shrine and will supplicate for you 
that you may attract many a soul to this mighty and 
wondrous Revelation.  
                                   Your brother and well-wisher, 
                                                         Shoghi 
 
 
28 June 1926 
 
Dear Spiritual brothers and sisters:  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of 
those few kind words of love you all signed and sent.  The 
picture which your secretary sent under a separate cover 
was also received.  He hopes that more of such congresses 
will be held in that land and the youth awakened to the duty 
that has been laid upon them.  Unless they are aroused, 
unless they begin to feel their responsibility, unless they rise 
to active and effective service, the Cause will not really 
spread and quickly attain its desired aim.  
     The geographical position of Germany has given her a 
unique position in the spread of the Cause in Europe.  She 
stands actually in the center of that continent and from it 
can branch out tentacles which will gradually unite the 
whole Europe.  The signs that she can undertake such a task 
are clear.  We see there the largest number of the European 
&Baha'is most active and promising.  The only thing is, that 
the more united they are, the more devoted and steadfast in 
their faith they become, the sooner they will attain their goal 
and bring their task to a successful and glorious ending.  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to assure you of his prayers.  He 
hopes that the German friends will leave a memorable 
 
+P32 
record on the annals of the Cause and fully justify the 
expectations the Master had in their spiritual future....  
 
          [From the Guardian:]
My dear fellow-workers:  
     Your most welcome letter has rejoiced my heart.  Your 
magnificent endeavours, your tenacity of purpose, your 
firmness of faith, the ardour of your love and your grasp of 
the Divine Teachings are assets which I greatly prize and 
value.  My hope and prayer is that &Baha'u'llah may shower 
upon you His infinite blessings that the promise of our dear 
Master may erelong be fulfilled and that Germany may arise 
with one voice and one mind to champion the Cause of God 
and in the spiritual realm direct the nations of the earth to 
the path of true Brotherhood and Peace.  Yours is a great 
privilege and a noble mission; may He enable you to achieve 
your heart's desire.  
                                     Your true brother, 
                                                 Shoghi 
 
 
8 April 1927 
 
Dear &Baha'i brothers and sisters, 
     The beloved Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, thanks you for 
your good &Naw-Ruz letter to him, dated 1 &Baha 84.  
     He is very pleased that you have good hopes for the future 
and he will pray at the Holy Shrines for you, that you may 
be abundantly blessed--and that you may be enabled to 
draw many souls to the light of these Divine Teachings.  
     He is very interested to hear of your plan to build a 
wooden house on your new piece of land, to be a home for 
the young and the aged--and also that is to be used as a 
 
+P33 
home for poor children, to give them a change and rest 
during the summer.  It will be a very good and excellent 
work to build this house--and Shoghi Effendi hopes that 
you will have great success with it, and that you will find it 
of the utmost use and benefit for those who are poor in the 
world's goods....  
 
          [From the Guardian:]
My dear co-workers:  
     Your sweet and touching message of loyalty and love has 
greatly cheered and encouraged me.  I rejoice to learn of 
your steadfast love and devotion to our beloved Cause.  I am 
greatly heartened by the thought of your constancy in 
service and your splendid achievements.  I am deeply 
thankful for your aid and assistance in safeguarding and 
promoting the interests of the Cause.  I will continue to pray 
for you, one and all, from the depths of my heart, that the 
Beloved may deepen your understanding, broaden your 
vision, remove obstacles from your way, and enable you to 
become the purest mirrors reflecting the beauty and 
radiance of the Divine Revelation.  
                                     Your true brother, 
                                                Shoghi 
 
 
3 April 1929 
 
Dear &Baha'i brothers and sisters:  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of 
your joint letter dated March 21st 1929 in which you 
extend to him hearty New Year greetings.  He wishes me to 
reciprocate those sentiments and assure you of his prayers.  
He hopes that through your combined efforts this coming 
year will bring to the Cause, especially in that country, 
 
+P34 
wonderful success.  May God hear our prayers and grant us 
His blessings...  
 
          [From the Guardian:]
My dear co-workers:  
     I am deeply impressed by your message.  I will assuredly 
remember you in my prayers, that your numbers may 
increase, your influence extend, your understand of the 
Cause deepen, and your efforts be richly blessed by our 
beloved and departed Master.  Persevere and study the 
Teachings.  Rest assured that He will continue to reinforce 
your endeavours and enable you to realize your heart's 
desire.  
                                     Your true brother, 
                                                 Shoghi 
 
 
4 April 1930 
 
Dear Mrs. Brauns:  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of 
your letter dated March 22nd 1930, as well as the enclosed 
note signed by a number of the friends.  Shoghi Effendi 
hopes that the Master's spirit will assist you and guide you 
through these days of great tests.  
     There is always an important difference between friends 
and tested friends.  No matter how precious the first type 
may be, the future of the Cause rests upon the latter.  Up to 
the present the German friends were considered as loving 
&Baha'is, from now on they can be ranked as tested ones.  
 
+P35 
     In every country where such difficulties arise, they 
generally end with added energy and more intensive service 
of the Cause.  Shoghi Effendi hopes that in Germany also 
Mrs. White's activities will only arouse the friends and make 
them redouble their energy.  They can now see what enemies 
the Cause has to confront and how essential it is to 
strengthen its following.  
     In the &Bayan the &Bab says that every religion was meant to 
be universal and also deserved to become so.  The only 
reason why they have all failed to stand up to that mark was 
due to the inability of the followers who where entrusted 
with that task.  Let us endeavour lest we also fail to realize 
that ideal which &Baha'u'llah has set before us.  
     Please convey to all the friends Shoghi Effendi's loving 
greetings and assure them that during his moments of prayer 
he will ask God for their guidance and help....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
My dear and precious co-workers:  
     I am so pleased to have received your noble assurance of 
faith and loyalty to the Cause.  These days of storm and 
stress will serve to invigorate the Cause, purify and 
consolidate its foundations.  
     Persevere in your efforts, and be assured of my prayers.  
The Master will surely fortify, guide and bless His loyal, 
faithful and persevering loved ones.  I trust that my last 
circular letter which I sent to Germany a week ago, will 
clarify the vision and deepen the understanding of the 
friends.  May &Baha'u'llah's almighty arms surround you and 
fulfill your hearts' desire.  
                                     Lovingly and affectionately, 
                                                          Shoghi 
 
+P36 
4 April 1930 
 
Dear friends:  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of 
your letter dated March 25th 1930.  He hopes and prays 
that you will stand firm in these days of tests and appreciate 
the light and seek it steadfastly.  Miss Wright comes from a 
country where the friends have at several occasions been put 
to test and therefore she appreciates the difficulties that the 
friends are confronting.  Shoghi Effendi hopes, that coming 
from the Holy Land she will import to you the spirit she 
obtained at the Holy Thresholds.  
     Ever since the inception of the Cause we have been 
experiencing constant attacks.  Sometimes they came from 
outside.  Other times they came from souls most trusted and 
loved.  In every case however they have proven to be for the 
good of the Faith.  It is such events that arouse the friends to 
added service.  
     Shoghi Effendi hopes that as a result of Mrs. White's 
activities the friends will become more united and feel to a 
greater extent the importance of their task.  Perhaps, if we 
had endeavoured more, if we had sacrificed to a greater 
extent, if, following the explicit wish of the Master, we had 
sought to spread the Cause even more than we have done, 
Mrs. White and her like could not criticise us to such an 
extent and say that the administration has killed the spirit.  
Let us therefore take a lesson from what has passed and 
render to the Cause services still unseen in the history of the 
movement.  
     In closing may I assure you of Shoghi Effendi's prayers 
and loving greetings,...  
 
+P37 
          [From the Guardian:]
My dearly-beloved friends:  
     The expression of your loyalty and perseverance has 
rejoiced my heart.  You are truly the heroic pioneers of the 
Cause of God.  I will supplicate for each one of you at the 
Beloved's Shrine, that your understanding of the Faith may 
deepen, and that each of you may grow to become a shining 
star in the firmament of our beloved Cause.

Dear Dr. &Muhlschlegel:  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of 
your letter dated 31-5-30.  Concerning his translation of the 
&Iqan, Shoghi Effendi has finished it, but it needs going over 
and retyping, and this he cannot as before summer.  By the 
next autumn he believes it will be ready for publication.  
     Shoghi Effendi would therefore advise you to wait until 
then before you take any decision as to your German 
translation.  
     Shoghi Effendi much appreciates the service you are 
rendering.  The &Iqan is the most important book written on 
the spiritual significance of the Cause.  I do not believe any 
person can consider himself well versed in the teachings 
unless he has studied it thoroughly.  To publish it therefore 
in a comprehensive German will be one of the greatest 
services rendered to the Cause in that land...  
     In closing may I assure you of Shoghi Effendi's loving 
greetings and best wishes....

My Dear Friends, 
     I am directed by our Guardian to thank you for your 
letter of June 5th.  
     He learns with extreme pleasure and satisfaction of your 
gathering at a meeting at which all the dear friends of 
Vienna together with our good friend Mr. Adam Benke of 
Leipzig were present.  And he deeply appreciates your loving 
message of greeting above your individual signatures.  Such 
messages are always a source of pleasure to him, but he is 
especially glad to see the newly established centre in Vienna 
so full of enthusiasm, of love and of devotion to the Cause 
of &Baha'u'llah.  He prays from the bottom of his heart that 
our precious Master may fill your souls with His beautiful 
spirit and may help and guide you to serve His Cause and 
humanity.  
     He is so glad to know that Mr. Benke is going to Sofia to 
help Miss Jack, and he trusts that he will be of very great 
help to her.  
     With the assurance of Shoghi Effendi's loving greetings to 
you all,...  
 
+P39 
          [From the Guardian:]
My dear and precious co-workers:  
     I was so pleased to hear from you and to learn of your 
steadfast loyalty to the Cause.  The friends in Vienna are 
ever in my thoughts and heart and I will continue to 
supplicate for them the Master's richest blessings.

23 December 1931 
 
Dear Dr. &Muhlschlegel:  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to drop you these few lines to 
inform you that few days ago he sent to your address c/o 
Mrs. Schwarz a copy of his translation of the &Iqan which 
has just come out.  He hopes that it will help you in revising 
your translation into German which you have already 
made.  This is in fulfilment of the promise he made last year 
to send you a copy of his English translation when out of the 
press.  
     Shoghi Effendi has, through various channels, been 
hearing of the wonderful services you are rendering to the 
Cause.  He sincerely trusts that the young and educated 
&Baha'is, who have their spiritual faculties fully developed, 
and who as a consequence appreciate the significance of 
&Baha'u'llah's mission in the development of the world, will 
with one accord, arise and establish the Kingdom of God 
upon the earth.  The world around us is in a pitiable 
condition and its ills seem daily to increase.  It is for us, we 
&Baha'i youths, who have been entrusted with this divine 
mission, to do our utmost and rest only when the task has 
been carried to its successful conclusion.  
 
+P40 
     In his moments of prayer and meditation at the Shrines 
Shoghi Effendi will think of you and ask for you divine 
guidance and help....  
 
 
24 February 1932 
 
Dear Dr. &Muhlschlegel:  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of 
your letter dated Feb. 13th, 1932.  He was very glad to 
know that you have recovered your health and can resume 
your work as well as services to the Cause.  We surely cannot 
afford seeing the competent servants of the Faith 
handicapped by their health.  They are too few to be spared 
so easily.  
     Shoghi Effendi was very glad to know that the new 
edition of the &Iqan has reached you safely and that you are 
going to use it in going over your translation into German.  
He is surely very sorry that not knowing Persian you cannot 
go to the very original.  He sincerely hopes that before long 
we will have some of the younger members of the German 
&Baha'is who would make translation their life-work, and 
with that object in mind make a thorough study of Persian 
and Arabic.  They would surely be rendering a wonderful 
service to their nation as well as to the Faith as a whole.  
     In closing may I assure you of Shoghi Effendi's prayers 
and best wishes.  He will always be waiting to hear of the 
wonderful progress the Faith is making in Germany and of 
the role you are playing in it....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear co-worker:  
     I wish to add a few words in person and assure you of my 
keen and heartfelt appreciation of your high and 
 
+P41 
painstaking endeavours for the spread and consolidation of 
the Faith in that land.  The German believers have 
undergone tests of unprecedented severity.  They have 
weathered the storm in a marvellous spirit and with fine and 
praiseworthy determination.  These tests were God-sent, and 
will serve to deepen the roots of the Faith in that promising 
country.  Wishing you success in your devoted labours and 
assuring you of my prayers in your behalf.

     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of 
your letter written at the occasion of the &Naw-Ruz feast and 
conveying the greetings of the season.  He wants me to 
reciprocate these feelings and express his hope that during 
this new year, which has just begun, the Cause may make a 
progress in Germany unsurpassed in the history of the 
Cause in that land.  
     The world as a whole, but especially the people of that 
continent of Europe, is suffering great calamities as a result 
of wars, social dissatisfaction, fear, hatred and jealousies.  
And these forces of darkness are leading humanity to 
absolute destruction.  This state of affairs shall continue 
until the world is awakened to the importance of the 
Message of &Baha'u'llah--a Message especially sent by God 
to heal human ills in this present day.  
     Should we not, we who have been entrusted with this 
divine Cause, arise and with one accord proclaim the Word 
 
+P42 
of God throughout the world?  Should we leave humanity 
writhe in its suffering and prove ourselves untrue to the 
covenant made with the Master--the covenant, that we 
will to the last moment of our life strive to save God's people 
from complete destruction?  
     In his moments of prayer Shoghi Effendi will think of you 
all and ask God to guide your steps and re-enforce your 
efforts in proclaiming His divine message through the length 
and breadth of that vast continent.  He read your circular 
letter with deep interest; may the one you will write next 
&Naw-Ruz have still more inspiring news of the progress of 
the Cause to share with the friends throughout the world....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear co-workers:  
     I wish to add a few words in person, and assure you again 
of my deep affection and deep interest in your activities.  
Your loyalty and perseverance, in the face of formidable 
tests, are indeed worthy of the highest praise.  May the 
Beloved continue to guide and bless your high endeavours, 
and enable each one of you to render great and memorable 
services to His Cause, 
                                     Your true brother, 
                                                 Shoghi 
 
 
19 May 1932 
 
Dear Dr. &Muhlschlegel:  
     Some time ago I received a letter from you in Persian.  So 
happy I was to see you study that language that I showed 
your letter to Shoghi Effendi.  He thereupon gave me the 
&Iqan and also a booklet containing the Hidden Words, the 
 
+P43 
Seven Valleys and some Odes of &Baha'u'llah to send to you.  
Being very busy I did not accompany them with a letter.  I 
sincerely hope you have received them and are trying to read 
them.  In any case, if you have received them please drop me 
a few lines to that effect....  
 
 
10 September 1932 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of 
your letter dated August 20th, 1932 and to extend to you all 
the expression of his heartfelt appreciation and thanks.  
     The news of your successful "Sommerwoche" greatly 
comforted his aching heart.  He hopes that such important 
gatherings will serve to deepen the understanding of the 
friends and inspire them with renewed faith and courage to 
consolidate the work already inaugurated through the 
precious efforts of our German friends.  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes you to persevere in your services 
and be confident in God's unfailing help.  The Master has 
given us the assurance that He will bless our efforts and will 
not leave us alone and unaided.  
     With the renewed assurance of Shoghi Effendi's best 
wishes and of his fervent prayers on behalf of every one of 
you....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear co-workers:  
     I cannot refrain from adding a few words in person as a 
token of my admiration for the manner in which you are 
conducting your activities for the spread of the Cause.  You 
are often in my thoughts and are the object of my fervent 
and loving prayers.  The work you perform in summer 
 
+P44 
should be extended, its influence must spread, its 
attendance increase, and its foundations be strengthened.  
May the Beloved guide and sustain your high endeavours, 
                                     Your true brother, 
                                                 Shoghi 
 
 
14 September 1932 
 
Dear Dr. &Muhlschlegel:  
     I am in receipt of your letter dated September 4th 1932.  
Regarding your question on the subject of holding the usual 
festivals during this year when we are mourning the loss of 
the Greatest Holy Leaf; inasmuch as Shoghi Effendi has not 
yet returned from his summer vacations I cannot put your 
question to him and answer you immediately.  The friends in 
America, however, who were confronted with the same 
problem, put to him the same question by telegram.  I could, 
therefore, do no better than send you a copy of Shoghi 
Effendi's answer.  I believe it will give you the necessary 
guidance in solving your problem.  His cable runs as follows:  
     &Baha'i New York festive anniversaries should be 
suspended administrative gatherings including nineteen day 
feasts should be held with utmost simplicity....  
 
 
30 November 1932 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brothers and Sisters:  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of 
your joint letter dated November 12th 1932 written on the 
occasion of the birthday of &Baha'u'llah.  
 
+P45 
     We should feel deeply gratified and thankful to God that 
at a time when all humanity seems to be struggling in 
despair we can come together and, with great assurance, 
feast and be merry over the dawn of a new day; that in the 
darkness which envelops the world we see the approach of 
a new light and the breaking of a new era.  This is a true 
blessing and a bounty from God to those who believe in 
Him and accept His Revelation.  
     To express our deep appreciation for this gift bestowed 
by God we should arise and spread this message of hope to 
the suffering humanity around us.  Such is the nature of this 
gift that the more we give from it to others the greater will 
be our remaining share.  For what pleasure can compare the 
pleasure of bringing joy and hope to other hearts.  The more 
we make others happy the greater will be our own happiness 
and the deeper our sense of having served humanity.  
     In his moments of prayer at the blessed Shrines, Shoghi 
Effendi will think of you all and ask God to guide and assist 
you in spreading His message throughout that land and the 
neighbouring countries.  He trusts that, through your 
persistent efforts, innumerable souls will be guided to see 
the Truth and flock to its support....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear co-workers:  
     Your joint and welcome message brought strength and 
comfort to my sorrow-stricken heart.  The burden of my 
sadness and grief has been considerably alleviated.  I value 
the sentiments you have expressed.  Each one of you is near 
and dear to my heart.  I will continue to pray for you all, that 
the Beloved may protect, guide and bless you in your 
constant efforts for the spread of this mighty and precious 
Cause, 
                                     Your true brother, Shoghi 
 
+P46 
3 May 1933 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brothers and Sisters:  
     The Guardian wishes me to thank you for your kind 
words of April 23, 1933, expressing the greetings of the 
season.  
     He is deeply gratified to learn that when the friends 
assemble at such gatherings, and remember the occasion 
they are celebrating, they renew their determination to serve 
and ask God to shower upon them His infinite blessings and 
help them in the realization of their noble aim.  
     The more society is threatened by wars, and the more 
humanity is seen desperate before the problems that 
confront it, the more should the &Baha'is take courage and 
redouble their energy in diffusing the teachings.  For it is 
only through such divine precepts that the world can obtain 
peace and tranquility, and become an environment within 
which man can spiritually progress and attain his noble 
destiny.  
     In his moments of prayer at the Blessed Shrines the 
Guardian will think of you all and ask God to guide and aid 
you in the service of His Faith.  May through the light that 
emerges from your gatherings all the people of those regions 
receive the light of God and find their way towards eternal 
salvation....  
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Beloved guide your steps, cheer your hearts, 
enable you to promote far and wide the interests of our 
beloved Faith and aid you to consolidate its rising 
institutions, 
                   Your true and affectionate brother, 
                                               Shoghi 
 
+P47 
16 May 1933 
 
Dear Dr. &Muhlschlegel:  
     The Guardian ... does sincerely hope that the reports we 
receive here about the sentiments rampant in Germany are 
untrue to fact, that it is a regeneration of the people rather 
than a retrogression towards a dead past.  Because whatever 
we say of Germany, we have to admit that its people are 
endowed with a spiritual vitality quite superior to many 
other races.  Being in the heart of that populated continent 
and being inspired by such a strong religious spirit, 
Germany can easily achieve a wonderful task in 
regenerating the world.  The eyes of the world are surely 
centered around it expecting to see what it will do.  
     Yet we &Baha'is should remember that we stand above 
politics.  That that field does not interest us; that we 
attribute importance to things of the spirit, that we await 
salvation to come from the Faith that burns in our hearts.  
     In his moments of prayer and meditation at the Blessed 
Shrines, the Guardian will think of you and the other friends 
in Germany and ask God to guide you and assist you in 
playing your important &role of spiritualizing the whole 
world--so immersed at present in material pursuits and 
interests....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and precious co-worker:  
     I was so pleased to receive your letter.  I long to hear more 
fully and more frequently from you.  You are a tower of ... 
and a pillar of His Faith in that land.  Germany has a glorious 
future under the banner of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah.  Its 
mission is to champion the cause of God in Europe and 
establish it firmly in the heart of that continent.  The tests 
and trials which have beset the Faith in that land were 
 
+P48 
necessary and providential.  It is for the German believers, 
who have weathered the storm, to arise and promote the 
Cause, to proclaim the non-political character of their 
Faith, to establish its nascent institutions and prove by their 
words and acts their freedom from every taint of 
particularism and prejudice.  May the Almighty guide their 
steps, sustain them in their efforts and bless their activities.  
                                                       Shoghi 
 
 
14 June 1933 
 
Dear Dr. &Muhlschlegel:  
     Many thanks for your letter of June 4th 1933.  I presented 
it together with the enclosed report on the Summer school to 
the Guardian who was very pleased to read them.  
     He kept the report but wishes me to inform you that as 
the &Baha'i World Volume five will not be compiled and 
made ready for the press except after the coming summer, 
you could write another and fuller report to include the one 
that will be held this year.  There will surely be some further 
points of interest that could be mentioned; and it is always 
better to have such reports as up-to-date as possible.  
     The Guardian hopes that this summer a great step will be 
taken in developing the School and that you will play an 
important &role in that connection.  
     In case of the need of further correspondence on this or 
similar subjects please write directly to Shoghi Effendi, it 
will avoid unnecessary delay.  
     In closing may I express the Guardian's prayers and best 
wishes for the progress of your work in serving the Faith....  
 
+P49 
27 June 1933 
 
Dear Dr. &Muhlschlegel:  
     Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge on his behalf 
the receipt of your letter dated May 11th, 1933, together 
with the enclosed Program of the &Baha'i meetings held in 
Stuttgart and Esslingen, all of which he has carefully read 
and deeply appreciated.  
     In regard to the transliteration of Oriental names and 
words into German he wishes me to inform you that the 
system of transliteration actually in use in the &Baha'i world 
has been adopted and approved with only slight changes by 
a general Orientalist Congress representative of world's 
greatest orientalists including some outstanding German 
authorities in various branches of Oriental history and 
literature.  As you see, therefore, it is a highly recommendable 
system of transliteration and this is why the 
Guardian is so emphatic about its univeral adoption by the 
&Baha'is the world over.  Any departure from that system, he 
strongly feels, may lead to incalculable difficulties and 
misunderstandings in the future.  He would certainly urge 
you to adopt it yourself and then advise our German friends 
to do the same in all their official &Baha'i publications and 
particularly in the forthcoming issues of the "Sonne der 
Wahrheit" wherein some chapters of the "Dawn-Breakers" 
are going to be published.  
     Concerning the date of the anniversary of the &Bab's 
declaration the Guardian feels that it would be preferable to 
postpone the consideration of this problem until the 
Universal House of Justice is established.  In the meantime 
he would advise you to follow the system actually in use in 
the &Baha'i world, i.e. (year 9.) even in Germany.  According 
to this system the hundredth anniversary of the Declaration 
 
+P50 
of the Faith should be celebrated in May of the year 101, 
that is when we enter the second &Baha'i century.  By year 90 
we should not mean that 90 years have elapsed since the 
declaration of the &Bab but that we are in the 9th year.  But 
whether it is preferable to adopt this system or that 
suggested by you and which, you remark, is in use among 
Christians and Moslems, the future House of Justice has to 
decide.  
     Touching the &Baha'i funeral service the Guardian would 
like you to know that it is of an extreme simplicity, 
consisting as it does of a congregational prayer which has 
not yet been translated into any western language but which 
Shoghi Effendi is planning to have it translated and 
circulated among the friends.  The friends and relatives of 
the deceased who are unwilling to attend the service should 
not be forced to do so.  
     In closing may I extend to you the loving greetings of the 
Guardian....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     This is to assure you how glad and gratified I feel to learn 
that the German believers are taking so active a part in the 
international activities of the Cause.  Their thoroughness, 
ability, patience and open-mindedness highly qualify them 
to assume such responsibilities and undertake so great a 
task.  I trust that the letters you will soon be sending to the 
British High Commissioner for Palestine will be a prelude to 
the brilliant services you are destined to render to the Cause 
of &Baha'u'llah.  
                                      Your true brother, 
                                                  Shoghi 
 
+P51 
9 August 1933 
 
Dear Dr. &Muhlschlegel:  
     I am directed by Shoghi Effendi to inform you of the 
receipt of your letter dated July 13th, 1933, together with 
the enclosed copy of the petition addressed by the German 
&Baha'i National Assembly to the British High Commissioner 
in Jerusalem and the report of the &Baha'i activities in 
Stuttgart, all of which he has read with great care and 
deepest interest and for which he has asked me to offer you 
his heartfelt thanks.  
     Your petition, though short is, nevertheless, strongly 
worded and very substantial.  It is hoped that it will impress 
the authorities in Palestine and will enable them to realize 
the gravity and the urgency of our case.  
     Assuring you of his best wishes and of his ardent prayers 
for the success of your work,...  
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and prized co-worker:  
     Your prompt and able response to my request has greatly 
touched me, and I wish to express again my lovely 
appreciation and abiding gratitude.  I cherish great hopes for 
your future contributions to the spread and consolidation of 
the Faith in that land, and will continue to pray for your 
success from the depths of my heart.  
                        Your true and affectionate brother, 
                                                    Shoghi 
 
+P52 
1 October 1933 (Summer School) 
 
Dear &Baha'i co-workers, 
     The Guardian has just received your beautiful message of 
Sep. 3rd, 33, written through the kindness of Miss Jack, 
and he has directed me to thank you all for the success that 
has attended your summer school classes at Esslingen.  The 
importance and significance of such annual gatherings are 
immense, since they offer each and every one of you a 
unique opportunity to come and discuss together the ways 
and means whereby the Faith can extend and develop 
throughout Germany.  By the collective spirit, the unity and 
the enthusiasm they create, these meetings serve to 
strengthen the bonds of amity and cooperation among the 
friends and to give them a new vision of the Cause, of its 
imperative needs and requirements in these days of political 
agitation and strife.  The social and political conditions in 
your land are, indeed, very distressing, and if they remain 
unchanged for a long time, may hamper the progress of the 
Faith.  It is now that you should work in utmost unity and in 
the spirit of an unflinching devotion to the ideals and 
teachings of the Cause.  
     Shoghi Effendi hopes that your summer school will 
increasingly develop and will become an important center 
for the spread of the Message.  You should try to raise its 
intellectual as well as its spiritual standard and to pave the 
way for its future development into one of the foremost 
&Baha'i universities in the West.  Much stress should be laid 
on the thorough study of the history and of the teachings of 
the Cause, and particularly of the nature, basis and 
outstanding features of the Administration.  The severe tests 
and trials through which our German brethren have passed 
during the last few years clearly demonstrate how much 
 
+P53 
they are in need of a full comprehension of the 
administrative basis of the Cause.  It is hoped that in the 
coming years much progress will be achieved in this respect.  
     Assuring you all of our Guardian's best wishes and of his 
ardent prayers on your behalf....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear co-workers:  
     It is such a joy to learn that you have had the pleasure and 
benefit of the companionship of our dear and distinguished 
&Baha'i sister, Miss Jack, whose recent and exemplary 
services we all deeply appreciate.  I will remember you all in 
my prayers at the holy shrines, and will supplicate for you 
the Beloved's richest blessings.  May He guide your steps and 
cheer your hearts in the service of His glorious and sacred 
Faith, 
                                     Your true brother, 
                                                Shoghi 
 
 
11 February 1934 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother, 
     I am charged by the Guardian to thank you for your letter 
of Jan. 30th as well as for the enclosed pamphlet containing 
the address delivered by Herr Hitler on Oct. 14th, 1933, on 
the subject of Germany's attitude towards peace, all of 
which he read with deepest care and sustained interest.  He 
wishes me to convey to you and to all the members of your 
German National Assembly and through them to all the 
followers of the Faith in Germany his views on the present 
conditions in that land, and particularly in their relation to 
the nature and scope of the &Baha'i activities of our German 
believers.  
 
+P54 
     At the outset it should be made indubitably clear that the 
&Baha'i Cause being essentially a religious movement of a 
spiritual character stands above every political party or 
group, and thus cannot and should not act in contravention 
to the principles, laws, and doctrines of any government.  
Obedience to the regulations and orders of the state is 
indeed, the sacred obligation of every true and loyal &Baha'i.  
Both &Baha'u'llah and &Abdu'l-Baha have urged us all to be 
submissive and loyal to the political authorities of our 
respective countries.  It follows, therefore, that our German 
friends are under the sacred obligation to whole-heartedly 
obey the existing political regime, whatever be their 
personal views and criticisms of its actual working.  There is 
nothing more contrary to the spirit of the Cause than open 
rebellion against the governmental authorities of a country, 
specially if they do not interfere in and do not oppose the 
inner and sacred beliefs and religious convictions of the 
individual.  And there is every reason to believe that the 
present regime in Germany which has thus far refused to 
trample upon the domain of individual conscience in all 
matters pertaining to religion will never encroach upon it in 
the near future, unless some unforeseen and unexpected 
changes take place.  And this seems to be doubtful at present.  
     For whereas the friends should obey the government 
under which they live, even at the risk of sacrificing all their 
administrative affairs and interests, they should under no 
circumstances suffer their inner religious beliefs and 
convictions to be violated and transgressed by any authority 
whatever.  A distinction of a fundamental importance must, 
therefore, be made between spiritual and administrative 
matters.  Whereas the former are sacred and inviolable, and 
hence cannot be subject to compromise, the latter are 
secondary and can consequently be given up and even 
 
+P55 
sacrificed for the sake of obedience to the laws and 
regulations of the government.  Obedience to the state is so 
vital a principle of the Cause that should the authorities in 
Germany decide to-day to prevent the &Baha'is from holding 
any meeting or publishing any literature they should obey 
and be as submissive as our Russian believers have thus far 
been under the Soviet regime.  But, as already pointed out, 
such an allegiance is confined merely to administrative 
matters which if checked can only retard the progress of the 
Faith for some time.  In matters of belief, however, no 
compromise whatever should be allowed, even though the 
outcome of it be death or expulsion.  
     There is one more point to be emphasized in this 
connection.  The principle of obedience to government does 
not place any &Baha'i under the obligation of identifying the 
teachings of his Faith with the political program enforced by 
the government.  For such an identification, besides being 
erroneous and contrary to both the spirit as well as the form 
of the &Baha'i message, would necessarily create a conflict 
within the conscience of every loyal believer.  
     For reasons which are only too obvious the &Baha'i 
philosophy of social and political organization cannot be 
fully reconciled with the political doctrines and conceptions 
that are current and much in vogue to-day.  The wave of 
nationalism, so aggressive and so contagious in its effects, 
which has swept not only over Europe but over a large part 
of mankind is, indeed, the very negation of the gospel of 
peace and of brotherhood proclaimed by &Baha'u'llah.  The 
actual trend in the political world is, indeed, far from being 
in the direction of the &Baha'i teachings.  The world is 
drawing nearer and nearer to a universal catastrophe which 
will mark the end of a bankrupt and of a fundamentally 
defective civilization.  
 
+P56 
     From such considerations we can well conclude that we as 
&Baha'is can in no wise identify the teachings of &Baha'u'llah 
with man-made creeds and conceptions, which by their very 
nature are impotent to save the world from the dangers with 
which it is being so fiercely and so increasingly assailed.  
     The Guardian hopes that these brief explanations will be 
sufficient to guide our German National Assembly in their 
efforts to safeguard and promote the interests of the Faith, 
and that through them they will be given a new vision of the 
Cause and a fresh determination to carry forward its 
message to the world at large.  
     With greetings and best wishes to you and to all the 
friends in Germany,...  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     I wish to add a few words in loving appreciation of your 
strenuous, your intelligent and devoted efforts for the 
spread and consolidation of our beloved Faith.  May the 
Almighty bless your endeavours, deepen your understanding 
of the essentials and requirements of our beloved 
Cause, and enable you in these difficult and challenging 
days to promote its interests and consolidate its institutions, 
                                     Your true brother, 
                                                Shoghi 
 
 
21 February 1934 
 
Dear Dr. &Muhlschlegel:  
     At the instructions of the Guardian I am writing these few 
lines, requesting you to contribute an article in German for 
publication in the forthcoming issue of the "&Baha'i World".  
 
+P57 
     In view of the fact that the Biennial is an international 
&Baha'i organ, Shoghi Effendi feels that it would be 
appropriate and in full consonance with its nature and 
purpose to further widen its scope by publishing in it, from 
time to time, articles in various important languages which 
are of sufficient use among the friends.  This would greatly 
enhance the nature and render effective the circulation of 
the "&Baha'i World" by enabling non-English speaking 
believers to better acquaint themselves with some of its 
major contents.  
     Two articles in French have already been contributed to 
this end.  One of them is from the pen of a newly-converted 
and capable believer from Paris, a Princess, and the other is 
from a certain professor connected with the Sofia 
University.  Though not officially recognized as a &Baha'i, yet 
he is very sympathetic to the Cause.  
     The Guardian hopes, therefore, that you will be kind 
enough to respond to his request.  He feels certain that our 
German believers will greatly appreciate your contribution, 
and will be glad to witness that one of their members is 
taking such an active part in representing them in the 
preparation of this international &Baha'i record.  You need 
not write too detailed an article, and you can choose any 
subject you wish, provided it agrees on every point with the 
spirit as well as with the form of the Teachings of the 
Faith....  
P.S.  The Guardian can wait till the end of April for your 
article.  Will you please send it directly to his address and not 
to America?  
 
+P58 
8 May 1934 
 
Dear Dr. &Muhlschlegel:  
     I am directed by the Guardian to thank you for your letter 
dated Apr. 29th, as well as for the enclosed article and 
poems in German from your pen which you have kindly 
contributed to the "&Baha'i World".  He is planning to have 
them published in the forthcoming issue of the Biennial.  The 
German believers will, it is hoped, greatly enjoy reading 
them, and will be certainly encouraged to contribute more 
frequently in the future towards the publication of so 
important and so significant a record.  
     With the renewed assurance of the Guardian's good 
wishes and of his supplications for the expansion of your 
&Baha'i activities...  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     With the assurance of my deepfelt appreciation of your 
prompt response, and of my continued prayers for your 
welfare and success, 
                        your true and grateful brother, 
                                                 Shoghi

Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     Your letter of June 19th written on your behalf by Miss 
&Kostlin has been received, and its contents as well as the 
accompanying documents and notes have been carefully 
read by the Guardian.  He wishes me to thank you for them 
 
+P59 
all, and to convey to you his deepfelt appreciation of your 
painstaking labours for the consolidation of the 
administration in your community.  It gives him real 
pleasure to learn of the spirit with which you are toiling for 
the attainment of this supreme objective, and he is fervently 
praying for your guidance and assistance that you may 
speedily and effectively attain the goal of your heart's desire.  
     In view of the fact that there are no competent and fully 
reliable persons here to undertake for him any translations 
from German, the Guardian would prefer that henceforth 
you should send him a translation of the minutes of your 
meetings into English, so that he may be in a position to 
read them without any difficulty.  He fully realizes the 
difficulties which such a rendering would entail, and for this 
he wishes to assure you of his abiding appreciation and of 
his deepfelt gratitude.  
     In closing may I also express his hope for the success of 
your next summer school.  From various communications 
and reports recently received from the friends, he gathers 
that a large number of believers both from Germany and 
abroad are planning to attend the summer classes.  May such 
a gathering prove to be the right medium for bringing the 
German believers closer than ever, and for fostering among 
them the spirit of initiative, of service and of selfless and 
wholehearted cooperation in the path of service to the 
Faith....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and precious co-workers:  
     The message you have sent me is indeed most welcome.  It 
has filled my heart with joy and thanksgiving.  I am 
continually urging the friends and pilgrims to visit the 
German &Baha'i centres and particularly the Esslingen 
Summer School, as I attach the greatest importance to this 
 
+P60 
vital national institution.  I will continue to pray for your 
success from the depths of my heart.  
                                  Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                           Shoghi 
 
 
8 September 1934 (Summer School) 
 
Dear Friends and co-workers, 
     On behalf of the Guardian I wish to thank you for your 
deeply-appreciated message of August 11th which conveyed 
the gratifying news of the successful conclusion of the 
meetings and classes held at the annual &Baha'i summer 
school at Esslingen.  He was deeply impressed by the large 
number of the believers who have attended these gatherings, 
and particularly by the fact that they were representative of 
so many different communities both in Germany and 
abroad.  It is his deeply-cherished and long-wished hope that 
these annual meetings will in the next few years develop into 
an important center for the teaching and training of &Baha'i 
teachers, and that through them the knowledge of the Cause 
will gain an increasing ground throughout Germany and in 
the neighbouring countries and regions.  He would urge each 
and every one of you to make an effort to attend as regularly 
and as whole-heartedly as you can the future classes and 
meetings at Esslingen, and to advise your friends to do the 
same, so that through the collective and continued labours 
of you all these annual gatherings may develop both in their 
scope and in their influence.  
     The Guardian is ardently supplicating on behalf of you 
all, and is praying that &Baha'u'llah may continue to bless, 
enrich and widen the scope of your labours for the 
 
+P61 
promotion and consolidation of the Faith in your respective 
communities.  With his warmest greetings to you all...  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dearly-beloved co-workers:  
     Your message, which I regard as a compelling evidence of 
the regenerative power and irresistible march of the Cause 
of God has brought immense joy to my heart.  The 
convocation of such a representative gathering at such a 
historic spot, and on the morrow of the unprecedented trials 
which, through the mysterious dispensations of Providence 
have so severely afflicted the German believers, is indeed a 
historic event that every well-wisher of the Cause should 
heartily and joyously welcome.  A splendid beginning has 
been made.  I pray that as a result of the unshakable faith 
and the persistent endeavours of the German believers this 
institution may grow in effectiveness and scope and lend a 
mighty impetus to the spread of the Cause in your promising 
country.  
                                     Your true brother, 
                                                 Shoghi 
 
 
25 September 1934 
 
Dear Dr. &Muhlschlegel, 
     I am directed by the Guardian to acknowledge the receipt 
of your letter dated August 29th, and to express his 
appreciation of your highly-valued efforts for the 
translation of the "&Kitab-i-'Ahd" into German.  He hopes 
that copies of this precious tablet will soon be made 
available to all the friends, and that through its study their 
 
+P62 
knowledge of the Teachings will be deepened, and their zeal 
for their spread stimulated and sustained.  
     The term "&afnan" means literally small branch, and refers 
to the relatives of the &Bab, both men and women.  As the 
&Bab's only son died while in infancy, the former had no 
direct descendants.  The "&afnan" are, therefore, all indirectly 
related to the &Bab.  
     As to "&aghsan", it also means branch.  But it is a bigger 
branch than "&afnan".  It refers to &Baha'u'llah's descendants.  
     The "&Kitab-i-'Ahd" is, as you know, &Baha'u'llah's "Book 
of Covenant".  It is entirely written in His own handwriting.  
And in the light of the objections raised by some of the 
believers concerning the Will and Testament of &Abdu'l-Baha, 
it is highly significant to note that this Book of 
Covenant of &Baha'u'llah bears neither signature, nor seal, 
nor any date.  It was shown to the believers, and was read in 
their presence nine days after &Baha'u'llah's ascension.  The 
manuscript was in the possession of &Abdu'l-Baha all 
through His ministry, and after His passing it was found 
enclosed in His own will.  These two precious documents, 
namely the book of Covenant of &Baha'u'llah and the Will 
and Testament of &Abdu'l-Baha have both been carefully 
preserved and are now in the possession of the Guardian....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     I greatly value these fresh evidences of your continued, 
your intelligent and most helpful labours for a better 
understanding and a wider diffusion of the essentials and 
fundamentals of our beloved Faith.  
     You are indeed a pillar of the Administrative Order, 
which, despite the storms and tests of recent years, is rearing 
its head in the heart of your beloved and promising country.  
 
+P63 
Persevere, be happy and confident.  I will continue to pray 
for you from the depths of my heart.  
                                Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                         Shoghi 
 
 
3 November 1934 
 
Dear Dr. &Muhlschlegel, 
     The Guardian has received and deeply appreciated your 
message dated October 8th, and he has directed me to thank 
you for it.  
     He is, indeed, gratified to learn of your projected visit to 
the Holy Land, and wishes me to hasten in extending to 
Mrs. &Muhlschlegel and yourself a most hearty welcome.  
     It is his sincere and much-cherished hope that this 
pilgrimage will, in addition to its manifold spiritual 
blessings, give you a full opportunity to discuss with him in 
detail about the conditions of the Cause in Germany, and 
particularly as to the ways and means whereby the friends 
can best extend and consolidate the foundations of the 
Administration throughout that country.  You will be 
welcome anytime in February or March--which time 
seems to be the best for visiting Palestine.  
     With the renewed assurance of Shoghi Effendi's best 
wishes and of his prayers on your behalf, and with his 
hearty greetings to you and family,...  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     With the renewed assurance of my love, my admiration 
and prayers for you and extending to you both a warm 
welcome, 
                                 Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                         Shoghi 
 
+P64 
5 November 1934 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     Your message of October 20th addressed to the Guardian 
is just at hand.  He has read it with deep interest, and was 
profoundly touched by the expressions of love and devotion 
which it contained.  He wishes me to thank you for it, and to 
reciprocate, fully and to each and every one of you, the 
warm greetings and good wishes which you have been 
moved to extend to him on the occasion to the celebration 
of the birthday of the &Bab.  
     He wishes me also to take this opportunity for conveying 
to you all his deepfelt appreciation of your labours for the 
study and the spread of the Cause in Esslingen.  He hopes 
and prays that your community may, in the years to come, 
play an increasingly vital &role in promoting the Message 
throughout Germany, and particularly in strengthening the 
foundations of the Administration in that land.  Your centre 
is one of the oldest and best we have in Germany, and has 
tremendous possibilities.  You should, therefore, feel 
confident and to strenuously toil, so that your community 
may develop both in number, in strength and in influence.  
     With the renewed assurance of the Guardian's best wishes 
and of his supplications on behalf of you all,...  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dearly-beloved co-workers:  
     I am deeply grateful to you for the many and repeated 
evidences of your splendid devotion and firm determination 
to serve the best interests of our glorious Faith.  The work in 
which you are engaged is dear and near to my heart.  My 
prayers are always with you.  Persevere in your labours and 
never feel discouraged, however great the obstacles that 
 
+P65 
may stand in your way.  The Beloved is surely watching over 
you.  Be happy and confident.  
                             Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                      Shoghi 
 
 
10 January 1935 
 
Dear Dr. &Muhlschlegel, 
     The Guardian has received your letter of the first instant 
and he wishes me to thank you for it.  
     In regard to your visit to the Holy Shrines, he is sorry 
indeed that your coming has been delayed but hopes 
nevertheless that it will materialize very soon, and that the 
obstacles standing at present in your way will be completely 
removed, enabling you thereby to carry out your plan in its 
entirety.  He is fervently praying for your assistance and 
success in this connection.  
     With reference to the decision passed by your N.S.A. to 
publish in booklet form certain of the important writings 
revealed by &Baha'u'llah and the Master, Shoghi Effendi 
wishes you to express to the National Assembly his full 
approval of their plan.  He feels, indeed, that the time has 
come for the German believers to acquire a thorough 
knowledge as well as a full understanding of such important 
Tablets as &Baha'u'llah's "Book of Covenant" and &Abdu'l-Baha's 
Will and Testament, both of which constitute the 
very bedrock upon which the entire administrative system of 
the Faith has been raised and established.  As to the 
"Dispensation of &Baha'u'llah" it also constitutes an 
invaluable supplement to these afore-mentioned Tablets.  In 
connection with the "&Kitab-i-'Ahd", the Guardian thinks it 
preferable that it should be published in a separate booklet, 
 
+P66 
and that the "Tablet of the Branch" and the 
"&Lawh-i-Aqdas", both of which have been rather poorly 
translated from the original, should not be included in it.  
     As to the Declaration of Trust and By-Laws of the 
N.S.A., he wishes to re-emphasize the importance of your 
Assembly's adhering to the exact wording of the text of the 
constitution adopted by the American N.S.A. which, as he 
has repeatedly stated, constitutes a model for all national 
&Baha'i constitutions.  Anything not specifically mentioned in 
this national charter is left to the full discretion of every 
N.S.A. inasmuch as it constitutes a matter of secondary 
importance.  In fundamentals, however, strict conformity 
should be maintained throughout the &Baha'i world, and to 
this category belong all the principles, laws and regulations 
set down in the text of the national constitution.  As an 
example of the loyalty with which the friends are following 
this principle the Guardian is enclosing a copy of the 
national constitution of the &Baha'is of India and Burma 
which, with the exception of the Article VIII which is now 
being amended, conforms in every detail to the text of the 
constitution of the American N.S.A.  
     With his loving greetings to you and all the friends,...  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     With the renewed assurance of my loving prayers for you 
and of my deepfelt appreciation of your magnificent labours 
in the Divine vineyard.  
                                     Your true brother, 
                                                 Shoghi 
 
+P67 
4 February 1935 
 
Dear Dr. &Muhlschlegel, 
     The Guardian has duly received your letter of the 29th of 
January last, and has carefully noted the points which you 
had raised in connection with certain &Baha'i administrative 
regulations and principles governing the election of local 
and national assemblies.  
     First, he wishes me to express the hope that your next 
National Assembly meeting may be fully guided in its 
deliberations on the various issues confronting it at present, 
and also to assure you, as well as your co-workers in that 
body, of his prayers for the success of your efforts in this 
connection.  
     Now, as regards the number of delegates at the annual 
convention of the German friends, the Guardian fully 
approves of the practice which your N.S.A. has thus far 
adopted and enforced, namely to have 19 delegates instead 
of 95.  This, of course, is the only solution possible for the 
present, in view of the limited number of the declared 
believers in Germany.  
     As to the practice of nomination in &Baha'i elections, this 
the Guardian firmly believes to be in fundamental disaccord 
with the spirit which should animate and direct all elections 
held by the &Baha'is, be they of a local or national character 
and importance.  It is, indeed, the absence of such a practice 
that constitutes the distinguishing feature and the marked 
superiority of the &Baha'i electoral methods over those 
commonly associated with political parties and factions.  
The practice of nomination being thus contrary to the spirit 
of &Baha'i Administration should be totally discarded by all 
the friends.  For otherwise the freedom of the &Baha'i elector 
in choosing the members of any &Baha'i assembly will be 
 
+P68 
seriously endangered, leaving the way open for the 
domination of personalities.  Not only that; but the mere act 
of nomination--leads eventually to the formation of 
parties--a thing which is totally alien to the spirit of the 
Cause.  
     In addition to these serious dangers, the practice of 
nomination has the great disadvantage of killing in the 
believer the spirit of initiative, and of self-development.  
&Baha'i electoral procedures and methods have, indeed, for 
one of their essential purposes the development in every 
believer of the spirit of responsibility.  By emphasizing the 
necessity of maintaining his fully freedom in the elections, 
they make it incumbent upon him to become an active and 
well-informed member of the &Baha'i community in which he 
lives.  To be able to make a wise choice at the election time, 
it is necessary for him to be in close and continued contact 
with all local activities, be they teaching, administrative or 
otherwise, and to fully and whole-heartedly participate in 
the affairs of the local as well as national committees and 
assemblies in his country.  It is only in this way that a 
believer can develop a true social consciousness and acquire 
a true sense of responsibility in matters affecting the 
interests of the Cause.  &Baha'i community life thus makes it a 
duty for every loyal and faithful believer to become an 
intelligent, well-informed and responsible elector, and also 
gives him the opportunity of raising himself to such a 
station.  And since the practice of nomination hinders the 
development of such qualities in the believer, and in 
addition leads to corruption and partisanship, it has to be 
entirely discarded in all &Baha'i elections.  
     In connection with this, the Guardian wishes to draw 
your Assembly's attention to the necessity of adopting the 
system of plurality voting rather than that of absolute 
 
+P69 
majority voting.  For the latter, by making the repetition of 
elections a necessity, causes, though indirectly, much 
pressure to bear upon the person of the elector.  The &Baha'i 
elector, as already emphasized, should be given full freedom 
in his choice.  Anything, therefore, which can in the least 
interfere with such a freedom should be considered as 
disastrous and hence should be completely wiped out.  In all 
elections, it is always difficult, that more than a few 
individuals of high position should obtain a majority of the 
votes of the electorate.  Most of those elected have a 
plurality of votes.  To enforce the principle of majority 
voting, therefore, it requires that the election be repeated 
again and again and until all the members to be elected 
have obtained more than half of the votes cast--a thing 
which becomes the more difficult when it is a matter of 
electing an assembly of nine persons.  So, repetition in 
elections becomes inevitable.  And such a repetition is in 
itself a restriction imposed upon the freedom of the 
electorate.  The only course, therefore, is for every elector to 
write down the name of nine who he thinks are most 
worthy.  These nine who obtain the highest number of votes, 
irrespective of the majority of the votes cast, will constitute 
the members of the Assembly.  
     As to your last question whether the individual voter can 
conscientiously vote for himself.  The Guardian believes that 
not only the &Baha'i voter has the right, but is under the 
moral obligation to do so, in case he finds himself worthy 
and capable of assuming the responsibilities and duties 
imposed upon the members of every duly elected &Baha'i 
assembly.  It is for every believer to carefully weigh his own 
merits and powers, and after a thorough examination of his 
self decide whether he is fit for such a position or not.  There 
is nothing more harmful to the individual--and also to 
 
+P70 
society than false humility which is hypocritical, and hence 
unworthy of a true &Baha'i.  The true believer is one who is 
conscious of his strength as well as of his weakness, and 
who, fully availing himself of the manifold opportunities 
and blessings which God gives him, strives to overcome his 
defects and weaknesses and this by means of a scrupulous 
adherence to all the laws and commandments revealed by 
God through His Manifestation.  
     With the Guardian's greetings and best wishes to you and 
all the friends,...  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty protect, bless and sustain you in the 
historic services you are rendering His Faith, and graciously 
assist you to lay a firm and unassailable foundation for the 
future progress and extension of the newly-born institutions 
of our glorious Faith in your land.  
                                                   Shoghi 
 
 
5 March 1935 
 
Dear Dr. &Muhlschlegel, 
     The Guardian has received and carefully considered your 
letter of the 24th of February last, and wishes me to thank 
you for it.  
     With reference to your questions concerning the "&Kitab-i-Aqdas", 
he does not think that it would be advisable to 
circulate at present, whether among the friends or in the 
outside public, any of the existing translations of this book, 
in view of the fact that all these versions, both English and 
Russian, are not authoritative and hence may misrepresent 
altogether the Teachings.  
 
+P71 
     He would, however, suggest that your N.S.A. should 
appoint a Committee for the purpose of undertaking the 
translation of the "Aqdas" into German.  This is of course a 
peculiarly difficult task, as some of the members of such a 
committee should have sufficient knowledge of the Arabic 
language, and in addition should be well versed in the 
history and teachings of &Islam.  
     The Guardian hopes, nevertheless, that with your 
knowledge of Arabic and German you may be able to do 
something truly worthwhile and substantial in this 
connection.  Your translation, of course, will not be 
considered as final.  But for the present it would be of a great 
assistance to the friends in Germany who, as you rightly 
suggest, have a great desire to get acquainted with the laws 
and precepts of the Cause as recorded in the "Aqdas".  
     When completed, this translation should not, the 
Guardian feels, be printed entirely and circulated among the 
believers.  But only extracts of it should, with the approval 
of your N.S.A., be brought to the attention of the friends 
until such time as the publication of the whole book would 
be deemed advisable....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May our beloved and vigilant Master even keep you 
under His wings, and inspire you to promote far and wide 
and in a most effective manner the manifold interests of His 
Faith and its ever-developing institutions.  
                             Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                      Shoghi

7 May 1935 
 
Dear &Baha'i co-workers, 
     The Guardian has just received your warm and 
encouraging message of the 28th of April last, and has been 
deeply moved by the kind greetings and good wishes you 
have extended to him on the occasion of the holding of your 
thirteenth annual &Baha'i Convention in Stuttgart.  He wishes 
me to reciprocate the sentiments you have been moved to 
express to him, and to assure each and all of you of his 
abiding appreciation and gratitude for the remarkable 
unity, efficiency and zeal with which you are fostering and 
safeguarding the manifold and vital interests of our beloved 
Faith throughout Germany and Austria.  He feels confident 
that your mighty and sustained exertions will, even as a 
magnet, draw upon you the blessings and guidance of the 
Almighty, and thus pave the way for the wider penetration 
and firmer establishment of the Cause in your country.  
     The Guardian has been greatly impressed by the 
unusually wide attendance at this year's national 
Convention.  His hope is that this active and close 
collaboration among the believers in Germany and Austria 
will continue to manifest itself in all your local as well as 
national &Baha'i activities throughout the coming year.  He is 
entreating &Baha'u'llah, that His confirmations may keep, 
strengthen and inspire you in the fulfilment of your most 
urgent and sacred mission.  
     With the renewed expression of his heartfelt 
appreciations and thanks, and with his cordial and most 
loving greetings to you all...  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dearest co-workers:  
     Your impressive and most welcome message has revealed 
 
+P73 
afresh the potency of the irresistible power of our Faith as 
manifested in the renewed activities, the solidarity, the 
consciousness and determination of the assembled 
representatives of the German believers.  This year's 
convention marks a turning point in the history of the Cause 
in your land.  It eloquently testifies to the tenacity of your 
faith, to your grasp of its distinguishing features and 
essential principles, to your firm resolve to lay an 
unassailable basis for the rising institutions, to your 
capacity to weather the fiercest storms and overcome the 
most formidable obstacles, to your worthiness to rank as 
the standard-bearers of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah in the 
continent of Europe.  May signal victories crown your high 
endeavours.  
                                                 Shoghi 
 
 
5 July 1935 
 
Beloved &Baha'i Brother, 
     On behalf of the Guardian I wish to acknowledge the 
receipt of your welcome letter of the fourteenth of June last, 
written in the name of the Archives-Committee of the 
German N.S.A., and to convey to you and to them his 
loving appreciation and thanks.  He trusts that his gift, 
offered to your National Archives through the kind care of 
Miss Edith Horn, will serve to remind the German believers 
of the importance and sacred character of that institution, 
and to encourage them to help in contributing their full share 
towards its further development and expansion.  The 
institution of the National &Baha'i Archives which all the 
National Assemblies have already established is, indeed, 
highly-important, the significance of which will be 
 
+P74 
increasingly realized as years go by.  It is now that so many 
precious sacred relics are still in the possession of individual 
believers, that steps must be taken in order to insure their 
safe preservation in the National Archives.  The friends must 
be encouraged to cooperate with their N.S.A. for the 
attainment of this objective.  
     In closing may I assure you again of Shoghi Effendi's best 
wishes and prayers for you and family, and to express hope 
that your long-cherished desire to visit the Holy Land may 
be realized in the near future.  
     With his cordial greetings...  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and prized co-worker:  
     I cannot refrain from adding a few words in person and 
assure you afresh of my deepfelt love, appreciation and 
gratitude for the energy, the ability and loyalty with which 
you are promoting the vital interests of the Faith.  My 
prayers for you and your dear and valued collaborators will 
be continually offered to the throne of &Baha'u'llah.  
                                 Your true and grateful brother.  
                                                          Shoghi

Beloved &Baha'i Friends, 
     On behalf of the Guardian I wish to acknowledge the 
receipt of your beautiful message dated July 8th, and to 
convey to you his loving thanks and appreciation for the 
kind sentiments which you have been moved to express to 
him on the eve of the anniversary of the &Bab's martyrdom.  
 
+P75 
     He is, indeed, very much pleased, and feels greatly 
encouraged, to learn of the beautiful meeting you have 
organized in order to commemorate this most sad and yet 
unique event in the history of the Cause, and sincerely trusts 
that the recollection of these early days of the heroic age of 
the Faith will have served to fill with fresh enthusiasm and 
renewed vigour your souls, and that as a result you all now 
feel the urge to play a more active part in establishing the 
Cause in Austria.  
     The Guardian has been also gratified at the news of the 
marriage of our dear and devoted co-worker Mr. Franz 
Pollinger to Miss Anny &Modlogl.  He wishes them both a 
most happy and successful union and is praying to 
&Baha'u'llah that He may continue showering upon them His 
favours and blessings, and thus render their lives successful 
and of benefit to His Cause.  
     With cordial greetings from the Guardian and with his 
best wishes and prayers for you all,...  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dearly-beloved co-workers:  
     Your message filled my heart with joy and has powerfully 
reminded me of the firmness of your faith, the extent of 
your devotion, and the degree of your self-sacrifice and 
endeavours for the promotion of the Cause of God.  I urge 
you to maintain the closest contact with the believers in 
Germany and particularly with the National Assembly, to 
study and digest the chapters of &Nabil's narrative as they 
appear in "The Sun of Truth" that you may obtain a fuller 
grasp of the purpose, the influence and the moving episodes 
of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah.  
                                         Your true brother, 
                                                     Shoghi 
 
+P76 
12 October 1935 
 
Dear Dr. &Muhlschlegel, 
     I am directed by the Guardian to thank you for your letter 
dated September 7th, and to express his regret for the delay 
caused in answering it.  
     With regard to the "&Kitab-i-'Ahd" and the Will and 
Testament of &Abdu'l-Baha, he wishes me to inform you that 
he fully approves of your suggestion that these two Tablets 
be printed in one single booklet.  
     Also regarding the advisability of printing extracts from 
the Master's Will, he fully recommends that your Assembly 
should follow the method adopted by the American &Baha'is 
in this matter, provided of course it is financially feasible.  
The American text of the Will contains, indeed, all the 
fundamental points that every newcomer who wishes to join 
the Movement should know regarding the basis, and 
various vital implications of &Baha'i Administration.  The 
extracts contained in that text are thus what is vitally 
required of a believer desiring to become a voting member.  
     Concerning the new German edition of "&Baha'u'llah and 
the New Era" which the N.S.A. is planning to publish very 
soon; Shoghi Effendi trusts that this work will be completed 
in the near future.  He would be pleased, indeed, to receive 
any suggestion which the German Publishing Committee 
may wish to offer with the view of modifying and improving 
certain passages of the present text, and will inform you 
whether the modifications suggested are advisable, and 
hence whether they should be inserted in the new volume or 
not.  
     With his cordial greetings and best wishes to you and to 
all the friends in Stuttgart, specially to your dear family...  
 
+P77 
          [From the Guardian:]
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     I wish to reaffirm my deepfelt appreciation to the manner 
and spirit in which you strive to promote, consolidate and 
defend the interests of our invincible Faith.  Future 
generations will no doubt extol your services in this 
formative period of our Cause.  Persevere and rest assured 
that my fervent prayers will continue to be offered on your 
behalf.  Gratefully and affectionately.  
                                                    Shoghi 
 
 
22 October 1935 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     Your message of the first of this month has been received 
by our beloved Guardian, and its perusal has brought much 
joy and satisfaction to his heart.  He feels, indeed, 
profoundly touched by the kind sentiments you have been 
moved to express to him, and wishes me to reciprocate your 
greetings and good wishes, and in particular to assure you 
of his abiding gratitude for the ceaseless endeavours you are 
all exerting for the wider spread and firmer establishment of 
the Cause in your centre.  He cherishes the brightest hopes 
for the future of the Faith in Esslingen which, he trusts, will 
as a result of your sustained and collective efforts, and 
through the continued guidance and assistance of the 
German N.S.A., develop into one of the most active and 
flourishing &Baha'i communities not only in Germany but 
throughout Europe.  It has already acquired great fame and 
importance as an international meeting centre for all the 
believers throughout that continent, and specially in 
connection with the annual Summer School of the German 
friends which has been invariably held there.  
 
+P78 
     The Guardian is fervently praying that this progress, 
which has been so characteristic of the development of your 
community during the last few years, will continue 
increasing, and will thus fully repay your labours for the 
establishment and wider penetration of the Faith 
throughout Germany.  
     With his cordial greetings to you all,...  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     I value the sentiments you have expressed in your most 
welcome message, and I am deeply touched by its contents.  I 
wish to assure you in person of my loving and continued 
prayers for you, that you may grow in understanding, 
spirituality and influence, and play a worthy part in the 
expansion of the Faith and the consolidation of its 
institutions.  
                                     Your true brother, 
                                                 Shoghi 
 
 
12 November 1935 
 
Dear Dr. Grossmann, 
     The Guardian is in receipt of your letter of October 26th, 
and feels very much pleased of the news of the completion of 
the German translation of "The Seven Valleys".  He wishes 
me to congratulate you most heartily for this great service 
you have been able to render the Cause, and which no doubt 
will serve to enrich the record of the manifold 
contributions you have, during the last few years, so 
brilliantly made towards the spread of the Faith throughout 
Germany.  He is praying to &Baha'u'llah that He may 
 
+P79 
continue to guide and inspire you, and assist you in 
accomplishing still more outstanding works for the Cause in 
your country.  
     Regarding the publication of the manuscript, he sees no 
objection that it should be undertaken by a &non-Baha'i 
publisher, inasmuch as it will then have a greater appeal to 
the general public.  But, of course, in this as well as in all 
other local matters of this kind you should seek the approval 
of the N.S.A.  As to the expenses of printing the work, they 
should be preferably furnished by the national fund.  
     The Guardian is also very much pleased to learn of the 
new publications which the N.S.A. is planning to issue very 
soon.  The printing of the lectures delivered at the last 
Esslingen Summer School in a book form is, no doubt, 
highly useful.  It is hoped that the funds required in this 
connection, as well as for other important publications, will 
be generously contributed by both the individual believers, 
and the local groups and assemblies.  
     With reference to the publication of the "&Kitab-i-Iqan" 
into Esperanto, the Guardian also hopes that some action 
will be taken in this matter by the N.S.A.  But obviously the 
printing of this, and other non-German works, should be 
subordinated to the publication of &Baha'i literature in 
German....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     I am so eager to learn that your health is fully restored, 
for I believe your services are a most valuable asset to the 
Faith you serve in these troublous days.  I welcome your 
efficient and unrelaxing cooperation, in spite of the 
obstacles which face you, in so many fields of &Baha'i 
activity.  I am confident that as a result of your strenuous 
endeavours the administrative institutions in your land will 
 
+P80 
be further consolidated and extended and the cause of 
teaching receive an added impetus.  
                                     Your true brother, 
                                                Shoghi 
 
 
5 April 1936 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends, 
     Your most welcome message of the first &Naw-Ruz has 
just arrived and its perusal has brought indescribable joy to 
our Guardian's heart.  He is so thankful and happy that the 
friends in Vienna are working so unitedly and with such 
fervour, and he hopes that as a result the Cause will steadily 
develop, and your centre will become one of the leading 
&Baha'i communities in the West.  
     The most vital matter on which the Guardian wishes you 
to fully concentrate is that of consolidating the foundations 
of the Administration.  Not until your group learns to work 
efficiently through obedience to the local assembly and 
under its guidance can there be any hope for future 
expansion.  The friends must all realize the necessity of 
internal discipline and order which only a properly elected 
and efficiently functioning body such as the local assembly 
can effectively maintain.  Obedience to the decisions of the 
local assembly should be unqualified and whole-hearted, as 
by this means alone can the community work as a united 
body and achieve something constructive and enduring.  
     The Guardian feels also the necessity of urging you to 
keep always in touch with the friends in Germany.  The 
center in Vienna, though outside the political boundaries of 
Germany, forms nevertheless an integral part of the 
 
+P81 
German-speaking &Baha'i community.  It is therefore of a 
vital importance that the ties of fellowship and cooperation 
between you and the German believers be increasingly 
strengthened and consolidated so that through your united 
endeavours the Cause in Germany and Austria may rapidly 
spread and be established on firm foundations....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dearly beloved friends:  
     I am deeply grateful to you for your constant services, 
your unswerving loyalty, your firm determination and 
exemplary devotion to our beloved Cause.  Unity and 
cooperation are absolutely essential and vital at the present 
stage of your development.  Persevere and rest assured I will 
continue to pray for you all from the depths of my heart.  
                                               Affectionately, 
                                                        Shoghi 
 
 
10 May 1936 
 
Dear Dr. &Muhlschlegel, 
     Your letter dated May 1st with the enclosed message from 
the Annual Convention of the German friends have all duly 
arrived and been read with deepest interest and satisfaction 
by our beloved Guardian.  
     He is indeed pleased to learn of the results of your 
national elections, and wishes me to ask you to kindly 
convey to the members of the new N.S.A. his hearty 
congratulations, as well as the assurance of his fervent 
supplications on their behalf at the Holy Shrines.  
     The Guardian very much regrets, however, that the 
Convention has not been quite representative of the centers 
 
+P82 
in Germany, and particularly deplores the fact that the 
Vienna community has been unable to send any delegate to 
the meeting.  He feels the necessity of urging you to bring 
this matter before the N.S.A. at its next session, in order 
that they may strongly recommend all the local communities 
having an assembly to send every year at least one 
representative to the Convention.  The Convention meeting 
is indeed a very important gathering, and the friends should 
be strongly impressed with its importance and significance.  
With some effort and sacrifice it is always possible for the 
delegates to be present at the Convention-sessions....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
My very dear co-worker:  
     I am so glad to receive such a splendid message from the 
Convention.  To you, no doubt, must, in a very great 
measure, be attributed the success that has been achieved.  
The days of your pilgrimage will long be remembered, and I 
trust and pray that both you and your dear wife will as a 
result be assisted to lend a fresh impetus to the onward 
march of the Cause in Germany.  Upon you rests a high 
responsibility, and I am sure you will rise to the height of the 
occasion.  
                                                  Affectionately, 
                                                          Shoghi 
 
 
10 May 1936 (Convention) 
 
Dear Friends and co-workers, 
     Dr. &Muhlschlegel has kindly transmitted to the Guardian 
your very warm message, and he has read it with greatest 
pleasure and satisfaction, and felt deeply touched at the 
 
+P83 
assurances of devotion and loyalty which you have been 
moved in conveying to him.  He highly appreciates the 
sentiments you have expressed, and fully reciprocates your 
greetings and good wishes.  He has been very much 
impressed indeed at the large number of the attendants of 
this year's Convention, and hopes that in the years to come 
that number will continue increasing.  
     The Annual Convention is indeed a very important 
gathering at which both delegates and visitors should try 
their very best to be present.  It is a splendid and unique 
opportunity for the believers to come together and 
deliberate on the vital and pressing issues facing the Cause.  
It is for this reason, and also because the Convention is the 
sole body entrusted with the election of the N.S.A., that the 
friends, and particularly the delegates, should make every 
effort to take part in the deliberations and discussions of 
that annual gathering.  
     With most loving greetings, and sincere good wishes from 
the Guardian to you all....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dearly beloved friends:  
     The Convention of the German believers marks another 
milestone in the notable progress achieved in recent years by 
the German &Baha'i Community.  My heart is filled with 
gratitude for the manifold evidences of the tenacity of faith, 
the collective efforts, the consolidated unity, the 
administrative accomplishments and the spiritual fervour so 
strikingly displayed by its members.  &Abdu'l-Baha, whose 
special care, love and solicitude for the followers of 
&Baha'u'llah in that promising country, most of you have 
recognized and no doubt still remember, is truly proud of 
your accomplishments and is well-pleased with the spirit 
that so powerfully animates you in His service.  His spirit 
 
+P84 
will continue to overshadow you in your labours and to 
sustain and guide you in your exertions.  Persevere and be 
confident.  
                                              Affectionately 
                                                      Shoghi 
 
 
10 September 1936 (Summer School) 
 
Beloved &Baha'i Friends, 
     Our dear friend Miss &Kostlin has kindly transmitted to 
the Guardian the beautiful message which you have 
addressed to him on the occasion of the holding of the fifth 
German &Baha'i Summer School at Esslingen, and I wish to 
hasten in thanking you on his behalf for the expressions of 
loving devotion and the assurances of loyalty which you 
have been moved in conveying to him.  He profoundly 
values the warm sentiments you have expressed, and fully 
reciprocates your greetings and good wishes.  
     What has particularly rejoiced and cheered his heart is the 
realisation that the Esslingen Summer School is steadily 
developing and is speedily attaining the character of an 
international meeting place for all &Baha'i residents as well as 
travellers throughout Europe.  The success that has attended 
your school this year, as evidenced by both the wide range 
and number of the attendants, is truly encouraging and 
augurs well for the future of that institution which, we have 
every reason to hope, is destined to develop into a leading 
&Baha'i University throughout the West.  
     The Guardian's hope is that the German N.S.A. will, as 
in the last few years, continue extending to that school the 
moral as well as the financial assistance which it needs for 
its further expansion, and for a still wider and more 
 
+P85 
effective penetration of its influence in every &Baha'i center 
throughout Europe.  
     He also hopes, and indeed would urge each and every one 
of the believers in Germany to extend full and continued 
support to the N.S.A. in its highly-meritorious efforts for 
the extension and development of the Summer School at 
Esslingen.  He is confident that through such a close and 
whole-hearted collaboration between the individual 
believers and the N.S.A. that school will succeed in 
gradually fulfilling its unique and truly noble mission, both 
with regard to Germany and to Europe as a whole.  
     With the loving greetings and best wishes of the Guardian 
to you all,...  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued friends:  
     I am thrilled by the tone and character of the joint 
message you sent me.  The splendid achievements that have 
signalized the proceedings of this year's summer school are a 
source of abiding inspiration to me in my work, and will as 
a powerful magnet attract future blessings upon the great 
and noble work which its organizers are labouring to 
promote.  I will continue to pray for you and for your work 
in such a promising field and for so meritorious a purpose.  
                               Gratefully and affectionately, 
                                                     Shoghi 
 
 
9 December 1936 
 
Beloved &Baha'i Brothers and Sisters, 
     Shoghi Effendi is just in receipt of the message you have 
written him through ... dated November 28th.  How kind of 
you to address to him such touching and assuring words on 
 
+P86 
the occasion of the anniversary of the passing of our beloved 
Master &Abdu'l-Baha.  Your words have sunk deeply into his 
heart, and have imparted to it fresh encouragement and 
deep comfort.  What a greater satisfaction is there for him 
indeed than to see the friends, and particularly his well-beloved 
co-workers in Germany, unitedly and 
harmoniously striving to spread the glad-tidings of this New 
Day of God?  It is his most fervent hope and the object of his 
continued supplications at the threshold of &Baha'u'llah 
that your community which is already functioning with such 
a remarkable vigour, unity and efficiency may rapidly gain 
in numbers and in strength, and become a beacon of light, 
the radiance of which shall gradually penetrate and envelop 
all the neighbouring centers and regions.  
     Esslingen is not only one of the oldest centers of the Cause 
in Germany, but it is actually one of its most active, 
prosperous and promising communities.  Your center has 
indeed a glorious tradition behind it, and it is high time that 
you all, whether young or old, rich or poor, and no matter 
how limited your resources and numbers, should unitedly 
endeavour to extend and further consolidate the basis of 
your teaching as well as administrative activities.  
     The Guardian wishes you, in particular, to make a 
supreme effort to widen the scope of your teaching work, 
but would urge you to proceed in this, as well as in all other 
fields of &Baha'i service, with the utmost caution and 
wisdom, so that you may not run the danger of 
antagonizing or even displeasing the authorities.  With this 
important consideration in mind, exert all your efforts and 
all your resources for promoting this sacred Cause of 
teaching in Esslingen and in the surrounding communities.  
     With warmest greetings and hearty good wishes from the 
Guardian,...  
 
+P87 
          [From the Guardian:]
Dearly-loved friends:  
     I am profoundly touched by your message.  I thank you 
from the depths of my heart.  I feel proud of you, of your 
perseverance, your devotion and your loyalty.  Persevere 
and rest assured.  The Beloved is watching over you and will 
continue to bless your meritorious endeavours.  
                                       Your true brother, 
                                                   Shoghi 
 
 
17 March 1937 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your message of the seventh of March is just at hand, and 
I wish to hasten to thank you for it on behalf of our beloved 
Guardian, and to renew his gratitude and appreciation for 
the assurances of devoted love and loyalty which you had 
been moved to convey to him.  He very deeply values your 
sentiments, indeed, and greatly admires the spirit of 
sacrifice and of whole-hearted consecration with which you 
are labouring for the promotion of the Faith.  The success of 
your efforts will assuredly depend upon the measure of 
unity within your group, and upon your firm resolve to 
uphold, in words as well as in deeds, those basic verities 
which the Teachings inculcate.  
     The Guardian's message to you is that you should 
constantly strive to mirror forth in your private lives, and 
also in your social relationships, the beauty, purity and 
regenerative power of the Message of &Baha'u'llah.  The 
&Baha'i youth of today should be an example to the youth of 
the world, and should therefore live up to the highest 
standards of conduct.  Nothing short of such a close, united 
 
+P88 
and concrete adherence to the ideals and teachings of the 
Faith by every young &Baha'i man and woman can impress 
and attract to it the serious attention and consideration of 
the world outside.  
     It is Shoghi Effendi's hope therefore that your youth 
group will make a renewed and determined effort this year 
to put into daily practice the principles and teachings of the 
Cause, and thus demonstrate to the &non-Baha'i youth of 
your country the tremendous power which the &Baha'i 
Teachings have to shape, mould and reconstruct the lives of 
men.  
     He is praying to &Baha'u'llah to bless and guide your 
endeavours to that end....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the almighty power of &Baha'u'llah bless you and keep 
you, shower his bestowals upon you, deepen your 
understanding of the fundamental verities and requirements 
of His Faith, and enable you to extend the range and 
reinforce the basis of your activities and achievements.  
                            Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                     Shoghi 
 
 
10 December 1937 
 
Dear Frau &Muhlschlegel, 
     The Guardian was deeply rejoiced to receive your very 
cordial message of the first ins., and is indeed happy to 
know that during the next few months you will be travelling 
regularly to &Zurich, and that you intend in this way to 
communicate to him any news regarding the situation of the 
Cause in Germany.  He truly welcomes your offer, and feels 
 
+P89 
that it is a most urgent and valuable service you can render 
the Faith.  
     Mr. Greeven, as you may know, is in close touch with the 
authorities in Berlin, and has so far succeeded in inducing 
the government to give more sympathetic consideration to 
our case.  The secretary of the Minister for Church affairs 
has promised him that the funds, books and archives will be 
returned, but that there can be no hope of having the 
government rescind the rulings entirely.  The negotiations, 
as you see, have not been quite in vain.  The friends should 
not feel unnecessarily agitated, but should have full 
confidence in the future which, we firmly believe, is 
gloriously bright.  As in the past, the German &Baha'i 
Community will eventually overcome and crush such forces 
of opposition, and will arise, out of the storm and stress of 
its present-day afflictions, stronger and purer and more 
determined to accomplish its allotted task in the 
establishment of the New World Order.  Assure the believers 
that they have no reason whatsoever to feel distressed.  The 
Cause is God's and is therefore in safe hands.  
     Regarding the German translation of the "Dispensation 
of &Baha'u'llah"; a copy of the German text of that pamphlet 
prepared by Miss Grossmann was forwarded to Haifa about 
two months ago through the care of Frau Brauns.  The 
Guardian wrote her in answer, that he would keep the 
manuscript until such time when the time and means for its 
publication would be found.  
     Now he wishes to know whether the translation 
mentioned in your letter is the same as the one sent by Frau 
Brauns, or is a new rendering made by Dr. &Muhlschlegel.  
     To you, to him, as well as to all your children he sends his 
loving thoughts and greetings....  
     P.S.  At the Guardian's instruction I am mailing to your 
 
+P90 
address a copy of the "&Baha'i World" vol. III, as to is not 
certain whether you or any of the German friends has seen 
this latest issue of the Year book....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     I wish to assure you and through you our dearly beloved 
German friends that the trials to which they are subjected 
are but a prelude to an age of unprecedented glory and 
activity in the service of the Cause of God.  These clouds will 
dissipate and the splendour of the Faith will be shed with 
increasing radiance.  Let the Cause grow silently and acquire 
greater depths in the hearts of the tested believers in that 
land, and the day will surely come when its potentialities 
will be manifested in a manner that would cause every 
beholder to marvel.  
                                          Your true brother, 
                                                      Shoghi 
 
 
2 February 1938 
 
Dear Frau &Muhlschlegel, 
     The Guardian was pleased to receive your letter of the 
26th January last, and to hear again from you about the 
conditions of the Cause in Germany.  
     He feels exceedingly sorry that the authorities have not so 
far lived up to their promise of returning the books, funds 
and archives that were confiscated, but still hopes that 
through the vigilant care, and the sustained and wise efforts 
of Mr. Greeven some definite results will be eventually 
obtained.  The friends need not lose courage, but have full 
confidence in the future which, we are all certain, is 
immeasurably bright.  
 
+P91 
     Now regarding the manuscript of the German 
"&Baha'u'llah and the New Era"; the Guardian has learned 
with satisfaction that the printing of the text has been 
completed, and he feels that in view of the present 
restrictions in Germany it would not be advisable to proceed 
with the binding there.  He would advise that the unbound 
copies be sent over, through the safest means possible, to 
the Spiritual Assembly of Vienna that they may complete 
the binding of as many copies as they can arrange for the 
distribution of the book.  
     Not only it would be too risky, and even dangerous, to 
publish anything at present in Germany, but it would 
constitute an act of disloyalty to the government on the part 
of the German believers, as you no doubt well know that in 
such purely administrative matters the friends are under the 
strict obligation of obeying the authorities.  
     As regards the manuscript of the "Dispensation of 
&Baha'u'llah", the Guardian is sending you under separate 
cover the copy which was presented to him sometime ago by 
Frau Martha Brauns, with the hope that the friends may be 
able to arrange for its publication outside Germany.  
     In closing kindly convey his loving thanks to dear Frau 
Vautier and to Mr. Leo Bernhard for the kind words they 
have appended to your letter.  He will remember you all in 
his prayers at the Holy Shrines, that you may be ever 
assisted and guided in your efforts for the service of 
&Baha'u'llah....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     The services you are rendering in these days of stress and 
turmoil are highly appreciated and deserve the highest 
praise.  Kindly assure again the dear German believers of my 
constant prayers for them.  The critical stage through which 
 
+P92 
the Faith is passing in their beloved land is but one stage in 
its evolution, a step that will carry them farther on the 
glorious path they have chosen to tread.  Perseverance is the 
virtue they mostly need at present.  An All-mighty 
Providence is watching over them.  Never must they feel 
disheartened.  I am deeply grateful and feel truly proud of 
the spirit they manifest.  
                                                    Shoghi 
 
 
31 March 1938 
 
Dear Dr. &Muhlschlegel, 
     Your letter of the 20th ins. sent from &Zurich has duly 
reached our beloved Guardian, and he was indeed pleased 
to hear from you, and was deeply touched by the messages 
which you and Mrs. &Muhlschlegel, Mrs. Vautier and Mr. 
Gollmer have so kindly sent him on the occasion of your 
visit to &Zurich.  Please assure them of his keenest 
appreciation of the sentiments they have expressed, and of 
his prayers for their protection and guidance in these 
difficult and indeed distressing times.  
     The Guardian is thankful for the report which you and 
Mr. Gollmer have given him regarding the situation of the 
Cause in Germany.  He truly deplores the existing state of 
affairs, but still hopes that conditions may improve sooner 
or later.  With the annexation of Austria, however, there is 
little chance of the authorities rescinding their rulings at 
present regarding the prohibition of the Cause, but there is 
every reason to believe that the assembly in Vienna will too 
be dissolved in the next few months.  
     Now regarding the publication of the German edition of 
the Esslemont book; now that the new regime in Austria 
 
+P93 
makes it quite impossible for the friends there to complete 
the printing of the book and arrange for its sale, the 
Guardian suggests that the best course to take would be for 
you to approach the American N.S.A. and to ask them to 
purchase the whole order.  Owing to the expansion of the 
teaching work in South America, where, as you know, there 
are many large German communities, particularly in 
Argentina, there would be a great demand for this book, 
and the Publishing Committee of the N.S.A. might arrange 
to sell many copies there, and distribute some, for sale, 
among various other &Baha'i centers in Europe and in the 
East.  
     The Guardian would further advise that you also 
approach the British N.S.A. who may find it possible to 
assist you in this matter....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-worker:  
     I am so pleased to learn that despite the anxieties and 
obstacles that confront and afflict the dearly-loved German 
believers, their devotion, loyalty, confidence and 
perseverance remain untarnished and unshaken.  I shall be 
glad to contribute the sum of thirty pounds as soon as I hear 
that arrangements have been made for the publication of 
Esslemont's book, and trust and pray that ways and means 
will be found to bring to a successful conclusion this all-important 
undertaking.  
                               Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                        Shoghi 
 
+P94 
25 April 1938 
 
Dear Friends, 
     The postcard message which you had sent the Guardian 
on the occasion of Dr. &Muhlschlegel's visit to Vienna, has 
just been received, and it made him immensely happy to 
realize that the friends in Germany and Austria have been 
again drawn together, and are closer than ever in the past.  
He hopes that the removal of the barriers which have 
hitherto so sadly separated the German and Austrian 
communities will mark the beginning of a new era of 
unprecedented growth and expansion in your affairs.  He is 
certain that you are fully alive to the far-reaching 
possibilities which the present hour offers, and wishes you 
therefore to be happy and thankful, and confident in the 
blessings which the future has in store for you, and your 
dear co-workers in that land.  
     I take this opportunity of assuring you once more of his 
prayers for your welfare, protection and continued 
guidance, and reciprocating your very kind greetings,...  
          [From the Guardian:] 
     Assuring you in person of my incessant prayers for your 
protection, guidance and happiness, 
                                your true and grateful brother, 
                                                         Shoghi 
 
 
21 May 1938 
 
Dear Frau &Muhlschlegel, 
     Many thanks from the Guardian for your very kind letter 
of the 11th ins. just received, and also for the revised 
 
+P95 
manuscript of the German translation of the "Dispensation 
of &Baha'u'llah" you have sent under separate cover.  He 
indeed appreciates Dr. &Muhlschlegel's painstaking efforts in 
revising the text, and wishes you to assure him that he will 
pray that a way may be soon opened for its publication.  
     As regards the German "&Baha'u'llah and the New Era", it 
would certainly rejoice your heart to know that in a letter 
recently received from the American N.S.A. they have 
suggested to defray the cost of purchasing the types, and of 
arranging for its publication in Switzerland.  The Guardian 
wrote them in reply approving of their suggestion, and 
urged them to take immediately the necessary steps, and 
also informed them of his offer to contribute thirty pounds 
towards the printing cost.  He will send the sum directly to 
the N.S.A., as soon as he receives word from them that the 
necessary negotiations have been completed.  
     Regarding the confiscation of &Baha'i literature and 
archives in Germany; the Guardian in a recent letter to Mr. 
Greeven advised him again to continue his negotiations with 
the authorities, but also stressed the absolute necessity of 
avoiding the exercise of too much pressure on them.  The 
situation is exceedingly delicate, and nothing short of 
Divine help and guidance can indeed enable the friends to 
obtain even this minimum of their demands from the 
Government.  
     In closing please convey the Guardian's loving 
appreciation and thanks to dear Frau Vautier for the word 
of greetings she so kindly appended to your letter.  Also 
kindly convey to Dr. &Muhlschlegel and the friends in 
Stuttgart his warmest and affectionate greetings....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     Wishing you and your dear and distinguished husband, 
the utmost success in your unceasing and noble endeavours 
 
+P96 
for the promotion and protection of the Faith in these days 
of stress and trial, and assuring you of my abiding and 
loving gratitude.  
                                 Your true brother, Shoghi 
 
 
7 May 1939 
 
Beloved Friends, 
     Shoghi Effendi has received your welcome card dated 
April 20th, and immensely appreciates the message of love 
and greetings you have been moved to convey to him on the 
occasion of the Feast of &Ridvan.  
     He too wishes me to extend to you his deep love and good 
wishes on this happy and blessed occasion, and to assure 
you, and our dear friends in Esslingen, of his prayers for 
your protection and guidance in these days of widespread 
gloom and distress, that your hearts may be strengthened 
and assured, and that you may emerge from your present-day 
tests and trials more united, and firmer than ever in 
your love and loyalty towards the Faith.  
     However gloomy the immediate future may seem to 
appear, the prospect which the distant future has in store for 
the community of German believers is of such immeasurable 
brightness as it cannot but afford the deepest comfort and 
encouragement to you in your moments of uttermost 
sorrow and distress.  
     More than ever to-day the Guardian's thoughts turn 
towards you, and our sore-tried brethren in your land, in 
admiration for the courage and fortitude you have so well 
displayed in the midst of your afflictive trials, and in 
thanksgiving to the almighty God for having sustained and 
 
+P97 
blessed you so repeatedly through His unfailing grace and 
mighty confirmations.  
     May His Spirit continue to aid and guide your 
Community in the distressing days yet to come....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear co-workers:  
     It was such a joy to hear from you.  You, as well as the 
other German believers, are often in my thoughts and 
prayers.  I will continue to pray for the realization of your 
highest hopes.  Do not despair, nay be assured that a 
glorious future awaits you all, more brilliant than any you 
can imagine.  
                                         Your true brother, 
                                                     Shoghi 
 
 
6 June 1939 
 
My Dear Friend, 
     I am directed by Shoghi Effendi to thank you for your 
letter of May 19th.  
     Although he was very sorry to hear of the deep 
misunderstandings and lack of unity that still exists in ..., he 
is thankful to you for your writing him about it, and he 
knows full well that you wrote because you are animated 
with a deep desire to remove all ill-feelings among the 
friends there.  
     The fact is that the Guardian is very sad over the present 
condition and because it is almost impossible for him to 
intervene from such a distance and without hearing both 
sides, he has written over and over again asking that the 
friends should gather, should talk frankly and fully without 
ill-feeling and should solve their difficulty.  This to Shoghi 
 
+P98 
Effendi's deep disappointment has not been possible, Mr. 
Herrigel has been uncompromising and firm and the result 
is that the Cause in ... is at a standstill.  This is why Shoghi 
Effendi would ask everyone and especially yourself to make 
every effort and help the situation....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
My dear co-worker:  
     A trusted friend of ours, Dr. Yunis &Khan is proceeding to 
Germany to visit the &Baha'i centres and I trust he will be 
enabled to promote true understanding and sustained 
cooperation in....  He is most trustworthy and capable.  I 
will continue to pray for you from the depths of my heart.  
Rest assured and never feel disheartened.  
                                  Your true brother, Shoghi 
 
 
5 November 1945 
 
Dear &Baha'i-Brother:  
     The message signed by you and other of our dear &Baha'i-friends, 
and dated Sep. 16th, Esslingen, reached our 
beloved Guardian, and brought great joy to his heart.  He 
wishes you if possible to convey the following message to 
those who addressed him:  
     Tell them that it was a source of deep comfort and 
gratification to him to receive a word of love and devotion 
from some of the German &Baha'is after all these years of 
silence and danger.  He was so happy to know they are well 
and have been able to meet with you and receive news of the 
progress of the Faith in other lands.  
 
+P99 
     He hopes that now that the war is over, and the regime 
which banned all &Baha'i activities in Germany is no more, 
the believers there will exert their utmost to teach this great 
religion of ours to their fellow-countrymen.  No doubt after 
so many years of deep suffering and bitter disillusion there 
are many souls eager for the truth, and more awakened to 
the need of a spiritual solution for the world's problems.  
     Please convey his love to them all, and assure them they 
are, and have been, often remembered in his ardent prayers.  
     The Guardian was so very glad to know you had been 
able to meet with some of the German &Baha'is.  He urges you 
to help and inspire them all you can.  
     His loving prayers surround you, you may be sure...  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     I was thrilled by the message you have sent, and feel 
profoundly thankful to &Baha'u'llah for having preserved you 
and your dear co-workers in that land, and for the spirit, 
which, despite the sufferings and turmoil that have afflicted 
your country, you so powerfully display and exemplify.  I 
cherish great hope for the future of your work, and I pray 
from all my heart for the Almighty's richest blessings on 
your activities.  Rest assure, be happy, and persevere in your 
historic and meritorious labours.  
                          Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi 
 
 
30 December 1945 
 
Beloved &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of April 4th has just been received by our 
beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer it at 
once on his behalf.  
 
+P100 
     It was with feelings of great pride and deep sorrow that he 
read of the sufferings of the German believers for their Faith 
and the persecutions they underwent so heroically, and with 
such unflinching loyalty, for our Holy Cause.  
     All during these long and tragic years of war his thoughts 
have been with the Community of the German believers, 
and his prayers have constantly been offered for their 
protection and the lightening of their heavy burden.  Other 
&Baha'i Communities, like France and England, have also 
suffered, but not to the extent of the German and Burmese 
friends who have been in lands ravaged by war and 
invasion, and in the hands, at the same time, of political 
parties who persecuted them.  
     The loss of all the records of the National and Local 
Assemblies is indeed very great, and he hopes that your 
family, Dr. &Muhlschlegel, Dr. Schmidt, Herr &Jorn, Anna 
&Kostlin, Frau Schweizer, Frau Schwarz--, in fact, all the 
old believers, will try and reconstruct from memory, and 
write down, as much of the history of the Cause in Germany 
as they can remember, so that some accurate records for the 
future will remain.  He would also like you to write a 
comprehensive account of what the &Baha'is have endured in 
Germany since 1937 for the "&Baha'i World", vol. X, and 
send it to him as soon as possible.  The news of the German 
believers' activities has been sadly missed in the last two 
volumes, and he is anxious to have them take their place 
again as soon as possible.  
     He has just written to N.S.A. of America urging them to 
help, and do all they can to protect the German &Baha'is; he 
has also urged them to make every effort to get German 
&Baha'i books published, and sent to Germany as soon as 
possible.  
 
+P101 
     You all have a tremendous task before you.  He knows 
how great is the suffering for just ordinary German citizens 
at present as an aftermath of the war--but in spite of these 
physical hardships the German believers are called upon to 
establish again the institutions of their Faith, teach its life-giving 
message to the masses, and help their country to 
obtain the spiritual destiny &Abdu'l-Baha foresaw for it.  You 
may be sure the Guardian and the &Baha'is everywhere will 
do all in their power to help the German believers 
accomplish their tasks.  
     Please assure all the friends--especially those who have 
lost dear ones in the war--of his most loving and ardent 
prayers on their behalf, and of his feelings of pride and 
gratitude for their devotion and loyalty to the Faith.  
     To you all he sends his loving greetings, his deep 
appreciation of your spirit, and the assurance of his 
constant prayers....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dearly-beloved friends:  
     My heart is filled with joy, pride and gratitude as I 
witness, thru the receipt of your most welcome letter, the 
evidences of the protection of the Almighty and of the 
vitality of the faith of the long-suffering German believers, 
who have laboured so devotedly and valiantly during so 
long and crucial a period and who as a community have 
survived the greatest ordeal in the history of their Faith in 
that land.  My prayers during these years of danger, of 
stress, of suspense and anxiety have ever surrounded them, 
and I rejoice to learn of their safety, their unity, their zeal, 
and their determination to arise and resume the great and 
historic work they are destined to carry to a triumphant 
conclusion in the years that lie ahead.  The organization of 
spiritual assemblies, the reestablishment of the national 
 
+P102 
assembly, the formation of national committees are the 
immediate objectives, and should, if possible be carried out 
with the utmost speed and vigour, for upon them will rest 
the expansion and consolidation of the activities of a sorely-tried 
Faith.  I am appealing to various &Baha'i communities in 
East and West to lend their assistance in whatever manner 
possible to the arduous task of reconstruction that now 
faces the German believers.  I long to hear of the news of the 
friends in other parts of that land and will do my utmost to 
aid them to resume their activity and services to our beloved 
Faith.  Please assure them all of my great love, of my 
profound admiration, of my bright hopes for their future, of 
my heartfelt gratitude for their perseverance and of my 
fervent prayers for their future success.  
                                        Your true brother, 
                                                    Shoghi 
 
 
Dec. 30th, 1945 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     It was with great joy that the beloved Guardian received 
your letter of Aug. 1st, and he has instructed me to answer it 
on his behalf.  
     During these long, sad, years of separation his thoughts 
have constantly been with the well-loved German &Baha'is, 
and his ardent prayers have been offered in the Holy Shrines 
for their protection and the protection of the Faith there.  
     Now that the friends are once again free to profess their 
beliefs, hold their meetings, teach the Cause, and uphold its 
institutions, he hopes they will exert their utmost to 
reestablish, as speedily as possible, the &Baha'i Communities 
of Germany.  The Faith in that land had, before it was 
 
+P103 
suppressed and banned, just began to enjoy the fruits of many 
long years of labour to promulgate it, and create its 
administrative bodies; he hopes that all the German &Baha'is 
will unite to bring it to the former level of prosperity it 
enjoyed.  
     He wishes to assure you all, and through you, all your 
&Baha'i brothers and sisters in Germany, that he will do all in 
his power to assist you in your labours, and that your 
&fellow-Baha'is the world over will likewise aid you as much 
as they can.  
     The beloved Master cherished very bright hopes for the 
future of the German &Baha'is.  His promises and prophecies 
will surely be fulfilled, and the Holy Faith not only be 
reestablished in Germany but grow and expand as never 
before.  
     The Guardian has urged the American N.S.A. to supply 
the German &Baha'is with literature as soon as possible; this 
will enable you to bring the teachings to your sore-stricken 
countrymen, and enlist them under the banner of 
&Baha'u'llah.  
     You may be sure the Guardian's loving prayers surround 
you all and sustain you in your labours for the Cause....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dearly-beloved Friends:  
     Your joint and most welcome letter brought indescribable 
joy to my heart.  I am thrilled by this latest and indeed most 
significant evidence of the unfailing protection of the 
Almighty, and of His manifold blessings vouchsafed to His 
dearly-beloved and worthy servants labouring so heroically 
for His Faith in that land.  Though I am greatly saddened by 
the fate that has overtaken a few of them during this 
prolonged ordeal they have experienced, I rejoice and am 
filled with gratitude, pride and happiness to realize that the 
 
+P104 
Faith itself has survived this fiery test, and has demonstrated 
its resilience, its vitality and incorruptibility after so crucial 
a period of stress, of suffering and danger.  The duty facing 
the triumphant community in your land is to reconstruct, 
with the utmost speed and vigour its administrative 
institutions, and above all, its national assembly.  I will 
appeal to our brethren in East and West to offer every 
assistance in their power for the rehabilitation of a 
community which is destined to play, in accordance with 
&Abdu'l-Baha's prophecy, so vital a role in the future 
orientation and expansion of the world-wide Faith of 
&Baha'u'llah.  I will do everything I possibly can to help it in 
its task and assist it in the achievement of its high destiny.  I 
will pray and supplicate on its behalf the abundant blessings 
of the Almighty, that its influence may revive, its number 
increase, its activities multiply, its resource develop, and its 
mission be fulfilled.  
                                 Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                          Shoghi 
 
 
8 April 1946 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your loving message, addressed to our beloved Guardian, 
brought him great joy, and he has instructed me to answer 
you on his behalf.  
     We all know how dark, and spiritually dead, the world is 
today, and how desperately it stands in need of spiritual 
guidance.  The &Baha'is alone, through the Message of 
&Baha'u'llah, hold the key to the solution of humanity's ills, 
and as much of the tremendous work which lies ahead will 
perforce have to be undertaken by young people, he 
 
+P105 
attaches great importance to the activities of &Baha'i Youth 
everywhere.  
     He hopes you will all study deeply the teachings, as this 
alone will give you the foundation you need for your 
services to the Faith.  You should also make every effort to 
distinguish your lives from those of other young people of 
your generation, and thus, by the display of &Baha'i virtues 
and morals, attract the interest and esteem of others.  
     You may be sure that his loving prayers will be offered for 
your guidance and protection in the Holy Shrines....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dearly-beloved friends:  
     I was so pleased and thankful to receive your most 
welcome message, and to learn of the resumption of your 
activities to which I attach the utmost importance.  I will 
pray for your success from the depths of my heart, and urge 
you to get in touch, as soon as possible, with the &Baha'i 
Youth in various parts of the world, and to strengthen the 
bonds that unite you to them, and to work in close 
collaboration and under the supervision of your national 
assembly as soon as it is elected.  May the Beloved bless, 
sustain, and guide you at all times, and crown your 
activities with signal success.  
                                     Your true brother, 
                                                 Shoghi

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of March 17th (the copy of which Mr. 
Eichenauer also forwarded) has been received by the 
 
+P106 
beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you 
on his behalf.  
     He is very anxious for the young &Baha'is, everywhere, to 
deepen their knowledge of the teachings, of &Baha'i 
administration and laws, and to live an exemplary &Baha'i 
life in order to prepare themselves for their work in the 
Cause as teachers and administrators.  They are the ones 
who will toil in the glorious and difficult days that lie ahead, 
and they must now fit themselves to be worthy of their 
future high responsibilities and duties.  
     He assures you all he will pray for your services, your 
progress and development, in the Holy Shrines, and he 
cherishes great hopes for your future....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear co-workers:  
     My heart rejoiced and my soul was refreshed at the 
receipt of your most welcome message, signed by so great a 
number of ardent and youthful co-workers in a land so rich 
in promise, so blessed by our Beloved, and so severely tried 
by the vicissitudes of war.  You are, I assure you, often in my 
thoughts and prayers, and I cherish the brightest hopes for 
your future work.  You are, I feel confident, destined to 
achieve memorable victories, both in your native land and 
on the continent of Europe, and you should diligently and 
unitedly prepare yourselves for this glorious task.  Persevere, 
redouble your efforts, and rest assured that the Beloved will 
bless and sustain you always.  
                                             Your true brother,

30 July 1946 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of June 29th, with its translation, was 
received, and our beloved Guardian has instructed me to 
answer it on his behalf.  
     He was so very happy to hear from your Assembly after 
all these years, since that important institution was 
disbanded, and hopes from time to time you will send him 
reports of your work.  
     As regards the question you asked him:  he feels that the 
&Baha'is in Germany should, by all means, follow the same 
procedure as regards withdrawing from church membership 
as that in America.  You should point out to the believers 
that, by belonging to other organized religious bodies, we 
are not acting openly because we firmly believe Christ has 
come again--so how can we belong to a church which does 
not accept &Baha'u'llah and His message as the fulfilment of 
Jesus' message and the reappearance of Jesus Himself?  
     He is very anxious that ways should be found for you to 
receive the money collected in &Tihran and spend it on the 
Cause and its institutions in Germany.  The eagerness of the 
people to hear of the Faith imposes a sacred duty on all the 
German &Baha'is to see that they are not denied this Divine 
Revelation in their hour of need.  
     You may be sure the Guardian will do all he can to assist 
you, and his ardent prayers are offered on your behalf, for 
your assistance, your guidance, and the success of your 
sacred labours to give to Germany the news of this precious 
Faith's existence, and to administer with wisdom the affairs 
of the Cause there.  
 
+P108 
     He urges you to hold as frequent meetings as possible, 
and, in cooperation with the American N.S.A. to get as 
much literature printed and disseminated as you can....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     Your letter brought great joy to my heart.  I rejoice to hear 
of the formation of your assembly, the cornerstone of the 
foundation of the Faith in that land.  I urge you to consult 
and deliberate as frequently as you can on the affairs of the 
Faith, devise the most effective measures for its spread, 
extend the range of &Baha'i publications, and the friends to 
scatter as widely as they can in order to multiply the centres 
and establish new assemblies, extend any assistance you can 
to the friends in Vienna and take whatever steps are 
required to enable you to establish the centre of the Faith in 
Frankfurt.  Your task is immense, the obstacles formidable, 
the need of your fellow countrymen for the healing truths of 
the Faith urgent and pitiful, the promised help from on high 
ready and assured, if you persevere in your task and arise to 
discharge befittingly your responsibilities.  The considerable 
sums accumulated in &Tihran will aid you to extend the 
scope of your activities and to consolidate your 
achievements.  You should, though these sums have not yet 
reached you, embark on great projects, and devise, after 
careful deliberation, effective methods for the propagation 
of our beloved Faith.  I am following the progress of your 
highly important activities with intense interest.  You are, I 
assure you, often in my thoughts and prayers, and I will 
continue to supplicate for you the Master's richest blessings.  
     Rest assured, persevere, and be happy.  
                                  Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                           Shoghi 
 
+P109 
31 July 1946 
 
Dear &Baha'i-Brother:  
     Your letter of July 1st was received by our beloved 
Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his 
behalf.  
     He was delighted to hear of the &Baha'i wedding which 
recently took place in your Community of Stuttgart &Baha'is 
and he thanks all the dear friends who were present, whose 
names you forwarded to him on the list enclosed in your 
letter, for their greetings and their loving thought of him.  
     In connection with the National Administrative Center of 
the Faith being in Frankfurt, he wishes to point out to you 
the following:  
     This is a purely practical measure because Frankfurt a/M 
is so much more centrally located than Stuttgart in the south 
of Germany.  The dear friends of Stuttgart must not for a 
moment feel that this detracts from the unique place their 
city occupies in the history of the Faith in Germany.  
     It is very similar to what has happened in the United 
States; &Abdu'l-Baha conferred many honours on New York 
and called it the "City of the Covenant", but this did not 
prevent Chicago from being chosen as the National 
Administrative Headquarters owing to its central position in 
America.  
     The Stuttgart friends should do all in their power to foster 
the development of this Administrative Headquarters in 
Frankfurt, and to ensure its success, as this is what is best 
for the development of the Faith in Germany.  But you can be 
sure Stuttgart holds a unique position and has received from 
the Master Himself unique distinction.  
     It is probable, but not certain, that the first Temple will 
also, for the same reason, be in Frankfurt.  The publishing 
 
+P110 
work, likewise, should be there in the future, but at present 
its location is for the N.S.A. to decide.  
     He was very pleased to hear you are requiring all &Baha'is 
to withdraw from church membership and similar 
organizations; he considers your Community the mother 
community in spirit, and is confident it will continue to lead 
the way in its exemplary conduct.  
     You may be sure his loving prayers will be offered for the 
success of the teaching and administrative work of the 
Stuttgart believers...  
P.S.  In the future Stuttgart must naturally have its own 
administrative headquarters for that city, and he hopes you 
will soon have found a suitable meeting place.  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     I was so pleased to receive your most welcome letter.  The 
friends in that centre are very dear and near to me, and I 
cherish the brightest hopes for their future in the service of 
our beloved Faith.  The Beloved poured forth His manifold 
blessings upon them and greatly admired their spirit.  May 
His Spirit continue to guide, sustain and bless them in their 
future services and high endeavors for the promotion of His 
Faith.  
                            Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                     Shoghi 
 
 
22 November 1946 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your most welcome letter of Aug. 21st reached our 
beloved Guardian after a long delay, as you can see, but 
brought him great joy.  He has instructed me to answer it on 
his behalf.  
 
+P111 
     He is fully aware of the very sad and difficult conditions 
under which you are labouring to reestablish the spiritual 
well-being of the German and Austrian believers, but he 
feels confident that your great faith, determination and 
devotion will enable you to achieve your ends and the aid of 
&Baha'u'llah is surely vouchsafed you as you serve His Cause 
and seek to bring enlightenment and inner comfort to the 
war-weary German people.  
     In connection with the various points you raise in your 
letter:  
     He is very anxious to see the "Sonne der Wahrheit" 
published again; as it will greatly assist you in sustaining 
and guiding the German believers and in teaching other 
German-speaking people.  He urges you to go on petitioning 
the U.S. authorities for permission to resume this important 
activity.  
     That so many members of the former "&Baha'i World 
Union" should now be seeking enrollment as believers 
greatly pleases him, and he feels you should by all means 
accept them as registered &Baha'is, unless you yourselves 
have any reason to question some individuals' sincerity.  
     He would like to receive regularly the minutes of your 
assembly's meetings in German; it is not necessary to 
translate the whole thing each time, but if a short summary 
of the important points could also be sent in English he 
would appreciate it.  
     The flourishing activities of the &Baha'i Summer School at 
Esslingen greatly pleased him, and he is so happy to see the 
way the friends have not only protected this &Baha'i Home 
during the long years of war and persecution, but 
immediately rallied around it again and made it once more a 
source of unity and a center of &Baha'i study.  
 
+P112 
     The long sessions of your National Assembly meetings 
are very essential for the promotion of the work in Germany 
and the rehabilitation of the affairs of the Cause there.  In 
your meetings he urges you to give considerable attention to 
carrying out the following very important tasks:  It is of the 
utmost importance that the friends be well supplied with not 
only &Baha'i literature, but with a regular &Baha'i News letter
--the organ of your assembly--and also with their own 
magazine, the "Sonne der Wahrheit".  He therefore urges 
you all to persevere in pushing these publication matters 
forward.  Needless to say the translation work must also go 
on uninterruptedly and receive first attention, as there is 
now a wealth of &Baha'i literature in English for you to draw 
upon and which is much needed by the German friends to 
help deepen their understanding of the Divine Cause, and 
better enable them to teach it.  
     The teaching work is, of course, the most important of 
all.  He has been very encouraged to see the efforts the 
friends are making in the U.S. Zone and to hear of the good 
results they are achieving.  But the primary responsibility for 
this great work rests on your assembly, and you must devise 
as many ways and means as possible for prosecuting your 
teaching plans on a wide scale and covering a wide field.  
Now that your country is in such a state of despair, and the 
people have suffered so deeply, their hearts are more 
receptive, as you pointed out in your letter, and therefore at 
this time they must be approached with the Divine Message 
before internal integration and new problems or new 
possibilities arise to sidetrack their attention.  He hopes that 
you will continually urge the friends to arise and teach, that 
you will devise ways and means (such as the summer-school 
and various conferences, committees, etc.) of training more 
of them--particularly the youth--as public speakers and 
 
+P113 
teachers and, in short, leave no stone unturned in 
prosecuting this major task.  
     Hand in hand with this intensification of the teaching 
work must go the multiplication of groups and their 
development into Spiritual assemblies.  
     Another important matter to which he wishes to draw 
your special attention is that of the Nat. &Baha'i 
Headquarters in Frankfurt.  He fully realizes the obstacles 
which must be overcome in order to carry out this historic 
project, but feels sure that &Baha'u'llah will help and guide 
you to find a suitable spot and make preliminary 
arrangements.  Ten thousand pounds is now reposing in the 
special fund he has established in &Tihran for the rehabilitation 
of the Faith in Germany and the relief of the 
dear friends there.  A considerable part of this he himself has 
contributed to this community which both the Master and 
he love so dearly--so you see the means to help you carry 
out the many great tasks confronting you are there.  He is 
most anxious that this money should reach you, and hopes 
ways can soon be found of sending it to your assembly; you 
should constantly bear this in mind, and let him know of 
any possible means you find of transmitting this sum.  
     I need not assure you of how dear your work is to the 
heart of our Guardian, of how eagerly he receives news of 
your activities, of how much he appreciates your many self-sacrificing 
and exhausting labours for the promotion of our 
beloved Cause!  You are very often remembered in his 
prayers, and he feels sure that the Master is extending you 
His own aid in serving His Faith in that country He loved so 
much....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dearly-beloved co-workers:  
     It is such a joy, mingled with feelings of deep thankfulness 
to &Baha'u'llah, to be able to resume direct correspondence 
 
+P114 
with the elected national representatives of a community 
that has achieved so much in the past for our Faith, that has 
been so dearly loved by &Abdu'l-Baha, and is destined to 
spread, as He foretold, the light of God's sacred Revelation 
not only in the heart of Europe but throughout that dark, 
war-devastated spiritually famished continent.  Now that 
the shackles imposed upon that community have been 
removed, and its chief and central administrative institution 
is again vigorously functioning, a concerted, sustained and 
systematic effort must be made, not only by its members, 
but by the rank and file of its supporters throughout that 
land, to expand, multiply and consolidate the community's 
nascent institutions, widen, considerably and rapidly, the 
range of its literature, establish, firmly and definitely, in 
however rudimentary a form its national headquarters in 
Frankfurt situated in the heart of that country, reinforce and 
develop the work assigned to its national committees, 
revitalize its summer-schools and other subsidiary 
institutions, maintain and develop its contact, through 
correspondence, with national and local administrative 
bodies throughout the &Baha'i world, devise effective 
measures for the proclamation, boldly and determinedly, of 
the message to the masses, fortify and enrich its corporate 
life and lay an unassailable foundation for its future 
development.  The task is immense, the opportunities are 
priceless and manifold, the hour is critical and challenging, 
the promises given by &Abdu'l-Baha are clear, unmistakable, 
and soul-refreshing, His assistance ready and unfailing.  All 
that is required, in thanksgiving for the protection 
vouchsafed to this community by &Baha'u'llah is to arise with 
courage, high resolve and clear vision, to carry out the 
immediate task in its entirety, and thus prepare the way for 
the opening of a new and still more glorious chapter in the 
 
+P115 
history of the evolution of the Faith in that land.  I pray from 
all my heart for the speedy and complete realization of the 
high hopes I cherish for that dearly-beloved, long-suffering, 
richly blessed community.  
                                 Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                          Shoghi 
 
 
18 February 1947 (Summer School) 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter sent to our beloved Guardian from the 
Esslingen &Baha'i Summer School session of August 1946, 
brought him great joy, and he has instructed me to answer it 
on his behalf.  
     It is wonderful to see that the German believers are not 
only free at last to meet and propagate the Faith of God, but 
that they are also receiving public recognition from officials, 
and that their numbers are constantly swelling!  
     All the sufferings the German believers have endured are 
not in vain; they now see before them many, many of their 
fellow-countrymen ripe to receive the Message of 
&Baha'u'llah, which, some of them, in the past, would never 
have listened to for a moment.  
     Now is the time to teach the Cause of God in Germany as 
never before; in spite of the hardships you are all 
undergoing, you must be active in building up new &Baha'i 
Assemblies while the people are still seeking some spiritual 
food.  We do not know what their spiritual condition will be 
like in the future when their physical lives are once again 
more stable and secure--so we must seize this golden 
 
+P116 
opportunity, and make every sacrifice to rapidly spread the 
Divine Message in Germany now.  
     He will pray for you all, that God may bless, aid and 
guide you....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     I was deeply touched by your message, and I greatly value 
the sentiments you have expressed, and the efforts you exert 
for the promotion of our beloved Faith.  I will pray for your 
success from the depths of my heart.  Rest assured, and 
persevere in your high and meritorious endeavours.  
                           Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                    Shoghi 
 
 
22 February 1947 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letters dated Sept. 24th, Oct. 1st and Nov. 12th, 
1946, have all been received, as well as the interesting 
reports you enclosed with them, and our beloved Guardian 
has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He was delighted to see that such large study classes are 
being held in Esslingen, and that so many people are 
becoming students of the Faith.  The German believers must 
concentrate all their efforts on teaching the Cause, as at the 
present time there are many truth-seekers; in the future it 
may be more difficult to reach the people.  
     The Summer School was also a great success this year, 
and our Guardian was very happy to see so many attended 
and that the activities of the &Baha'is are now receiving public 
approval, after so many years of persecution!  
 
+P117 
     You may be sure his loving prayers are offered for the 
success of your devoted services to the Cause of God....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Spirit of &Baha'u'llah sustain, guide and bless your 
meritorious efforts, aid you to render notable services to our 
beloved Cause, and consolidate its new-born and God-given 
institutions, 
                             Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                      Shoghi 
 
 
26 February 1947 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated Sept. 25th, 
1946, was received, as well as the minutes of your meeting 
of Nov. 2nd and 3rd., and he has instructed me to answer 
you on his behalf.  
     Regarding the question of Herr &Jorn:  Smoking is not 
forbidden by &Abdu'l-Baha; He advises against it for reasons 
of health, but we have no right to prevent anyone from 
smoking.  But drinking and the use of drugs are strictly 
forbidden and the &Baha'is should obey this command.  
     The Guardian has received a number of letters from the 
&Baha'is of ..., and in the interest of promoting unity among 
the friends in Germany he is going to write them instructing 
them to cooperate with and obey your Assembly; he feels 
that you should send capable &Baha'is there to teach them 
and strengthen them in the Faith, and to make sure no 
political elements are allowed to enter into their discussions 
or be a part of their group.  
     He has recently had fifteen hundred dollars sent from the 
Relief Fund in &Tihran to America for the immediate 
 
+P118 
purchase of food parcels for the German and Austrian 
&Baha'is, and hopes these will soon reach them.  It is very 
distressing that so much money over ten thousand pounds 
(&10.000) should be held in the name of the German 
friends, and yet no way of sending it be found.  He hopes 
your Assembly will make every effort to arrange for this 
money to be received in Germany.  
     He is also very anxious to receive news of exactly what is 
happening about the National &Baha'i Headquarters in 
Frankfurt; he gathers from your minutes that negotiations 
are in progress for a building in that city?  He attaches great 
importance to this undertaking, and urges you to press the 
matter constantly.  
     The reports he received of the young peoples' Summer 
School and the Summer School at Esslingen were most 
encouraging, and he is delighted to see that in spite of so 
many handicaps the friends are so devoted and active!  He 
was also very happy to note that new spiritual assemblies 
are in the process of formation, and hopes you will 
concentrate on their establishment and the formation of 
many new groups.  In spite of the conditions in Germany it is 
of the utmost importance to teach the Cause as widely as 
possible, especially to the youth, now that through suffering 
and disillusionment the hearts of the people are more 
receptive.  
     You may be sure that his ardent and loving prayers are 
offered for each and every one of you, and for the success of 
your devoted labours for the Cause of God....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dearly-beloved friends:  
     The revival and rapid consolidation of the German &Baha'i 
community after the prolonged and terrible ordeals to 
which it has been subjected is a striking evidence of the 
 
+P119 
irresistible power of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah, as well as a 
magnificent testimony to the vitality of the faith of the 
German believers.  I feel proud and profoundly thankful for 
the loyalty, the perseverance, the resolution, the unity, the 
zeal and the devotion which characterize their collective 
efforts and corporate life in the service of this glorious 
Cause.  The prompt establishment of the national &Haziratu'l-Quds 
in the city of Frankfurt; the rapid translation, 
publication and dissemination of &Baha'i literature; the 
multiplication of &Baha'i centers, whether groups or 
assemblies; the consolidation of the institution of the 
Summer School; the initiation of effective measures aimed at 
a close collaboration with the American European Teaching 
committee; the proclamation of the teachings of the Faith to 
the spiritually famished, the disillusioned and longsuffering 
masses--these stand out as the primary and urgent tasks 
that demand the immediate, the earnest and undivided 
attention of your assembly.  I will pray for your success from 
the depths of my heart and feel confident that the dearly-beloved 
heroic German believers will arise, as one man and 
despite the obstacles confronting them, to achieve these 
immediate tasks that constitute only a prelude to the 
tremendous enterprises which it is their destiny to 
accomplish in the years to come.  
                                      Your true brother, 
                                                  Shoghi 
 
 
4 June 1947 (Convention) 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     It was with great joy that our beloved Guardian received 
your loving message dated April 26th, and signed by so 
 
+P120 
many of the dear believers.  He has instructed me to answer 
you on his behalf.  
     The re-florescence of the Holy and beloved Faith in 
Germany, after so many bitter years of suppression and 
suffering, has brought great happiness to not only his heart 
but to the hearts of the &Baha'is all over the world.  
     That you should be able, in relatively so short a period of 
time, and in the face of so many obstacles, to reconstitute 
your assemblies and National Assembly, be in a position to 
elect new assemblies, and to hold your Summer School and 
various conferences, all point the way to a brilliant future 
for the German followers of the Cause of God.  
     He urges you individually and collectively to teach the 
Faith constantly to your spiritually starved countrymen, to 
support and assist your National Assembly in carrying out 
its heavy responsibilities and to do all in your power to 
hasten the day when a befitting National Headquarters, 
situated in Frankfurt a.M., will have been purchased and 
established, one that will be commensurate with the 
importance of the German &Baha'i Community, the strongest 
and largest on the Continent of Europe.  
     You may rest assured that his loving and ardent prayers 
are offered for your progress and success in the Holy 
Shrines....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dearly beloved friends and co-workers:  
     I was deeply touched by your message, and I greatly value 
the sentiments you have expressed, the zeal and unity you 
demonstrate, the deeds you accomplish, the plans you have 
conceived, and above all the spirit you so powerfully 
manifest in your diligent labours for the spread and 
consolidation of our beloved Faith in your promising 
country.  The German &Baha'i community, emerging 
 
+P121 
triumphantly from one of the severest ordeals that have 
afflicted any of its sister-communities in East or West, now 
stands on the threshold of a new era in its development.  
Great tasks confront it.  The establishment of a befitting 
administrative centre in the heart of that country, the 
multiplication of groups and assemblies, the dissemination 
of &Baha'i literature and the proclamation of the Faith to the 
masses are among the most urgent, the most vital and 
outstanding of these tasks.  The entire community, however 
difficult the present circumstances, must arise and carry 
them out.  Its future as prophecied by &Abdu'l-Baha is 
glorious.  Its spirit is magnificent.  Its members are 
distinguished among the followers of the Faith throughout 
the world by their tenacity, their thoroughness, their great 
capacity and resourcefulness.  Our beloved Master, who 
watches over them, has greatly praised them, loves them 
dearly, is ready to bless their labours and reinforce their 
exertions.  Its members must rise to the height of their 
present and priceless opportunity.  They will, I feel 
confident, prove themselves worthy of the great blessings 
showered upon them in the past by their Lord and Master.  
                                             Affectionately, 
                                                      Shoghi 
 
 
19 June 1947 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your loving message, sent to our beloved Guardian on 
the occasion of the celebration of his twenty-five years of 
Guardianship, reached him and touched him very much 
indeed.  
 
+P122 
     He feels a special affection for the Esslingen Community, 
as it is not only one of the oldest ones in Germany but he 
associates it with the important Summer School held in its 
neighbourhood.  
     Your love for and devotion to our glorious Faith are 
greatly appreciated, and the many services that members of 
your Community have rendered, and are rendering it, 
deeply valued.  
     He assures you all he will pray for the success of your 
labours in the Holy Shrines, and that &Baha'u'llah may 
increase your numbers and richly bless you all....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Beloved bless your efforts, guide your steps, 
remove every obstacle that impedes the growth of your 
Community, and assist you to proclaim the truths of His 
Faith and consolidate its institutions, 
                                Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                         Shoghi 
 
 
24 June 1947 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter, dated June 16th, has been received, and our 
beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer it on his 
behalf.  
     He can quite well understand that after so many years of 
isolation from the rest of the &Baha'i world it came as a 
surprise to some of you to hear that we, as &Baha'is, must not 
have any affiliations with churches or political parties.  But 
he feels certain that when you meditate on this matter you 
yourselves will see the wisdom of it.  We, as &Baha'is, can 
never be known as hypocrites or as people insincere in their 
 
+P123 
protestations and because of this we cannot subscribe to 
both the Faith of &Baha'u'llah and ordinary church dogma.  
The churches are waiting for the coming of Jesus Christ; we 
believe He has come again in the Glory of the Father.  The 
churches teach doctrines--various ones in various creeds
--which we as &Baha'is do not accept; such as the bodily 
Resurrection, confession, or, in some creeds, the denial of 
the Immaculate Conception.  In other words there is no 
Christian church today whose dogmas we, as &Baha'is can 
truthfully say we accept in their entirety--therefore to 
remain a member of the Church is not proper for us, for we 
do so under false pretences.  We should, therefore, withdraw 
from our churches but continue to associate, if we wish to, 
with the church members and ministers.  
     Our belief in Christ, as &Baha'is, is so firm, so unshakable 
and so exalted in nature that very few Christians are to be 
found nowadays who love Him and reverence Him and 
have the faith in Him that we have.  It is only from the 
dogmas and creeds of the churches that we dissociate 
ourselves; not from the spirit of Christianity.  
     Very much the same reasons motivate us in withdrawing 
from all political movements, however close some of their 
ideals may be to ours.  We &Baha'is are one the world-over, 
we are seeking to build up a New World Order, Divine in 
origin.  How can we do this if every &Baha'i is a member of a 
different political party--some of them diametrically 
opposed to each other?  Where is our unity then?  We would 
be divided because of politics, against ourselves, and this is 
the opposite of our purpose.  Obviously if one &Baha'i in 
Austria, is given freedom to choose a political party and join 
it, however good its aims may be, another &Baha'i in Japan, 
or America or India, has the right to do the same thing, and 
he might belong to a party the very opposite in principle to 
 
+P124 
that which the Austrian &Baha'i belongs to.  Where would be 
the unity of the Faith then?  These two spiritual brothers 
would be working against each other, because of their 
political affiliations (as the Christians of Europe have been 
doing in so many fratricidal wars).  
     The best way for a &Baha'i to serve his country and the 
world is to work for the establishment of &Baha'u'llah's 
World Order, which will gradually unite all men and do 
away with divisive political systems and religious creeds.  
     He does not force you to do this at once; but urges you all 
to decide to withdraw from your churches and political 
groups within, say, a year, and then to help each other to do 
this.  You will find your spiritual strength greater for taking 
this step.  
     Please assure dear Mrs. Schwarz of his loving prayers on 
her behalf.  
     He will also pray for you all in the Holy Shrines, and 
urges you to persevere in your services to our beloved 
Faith....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     I was so pleased to receive your message and so thankful 
for the evidences of devotion, of determination and love it 
contained.  The Austrian believers are dear and near to my 
heart, and I deeply sympathize with them in the ordeal and 
tribulations which they have suffered, and which have 
demonstrated the quality of their faith and the depth of their 
devotion.  The funds accumulated for their relief and for the 
development of the Faith in their land will, I trust, be soon 
forwarded to them, and will no doubt greatly contribute to 
the rehabilitation and growth of their beloved community.  
Persevere in your meritorious labours, and rest assured that 
you are often in my thoughts and prayers, and that I will 
 
+P125 
continue to supplicate for you all the Master's richest 
blessings.  
                                 Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                          Shoghi 
 
P.S.  He feels that the German and Austrian believers are one 
in language and that the Austrian friends should consider 
the N.G.R. as their National Assembly, the same as before 
the war.  We are &Baha'is and have no nationalistic feelings in 
such matters.  Our ties are purely spiritual.  But you can 
consult the European Teaching Committee if the NGR is 
too difficult at present.  The Guardian wishes you to know 
that as soon as there are a sufficient number of &Baha'i 
assemblies in Austria she will naturally have her own NGR.  
 
 
27 September 1947 (Summer School) 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letters to our beloved Guardian reached him 
through Mr. ..., and he was delighted to see that 
so many believers had been able to attend the school at 
Esslingen this summer.  
     It shows the vitality of the German &Baha'is and their 
intense desire to further the interests of our glorious Faith in 
Germany, and build up its institutions.  
     He urges you all, in your work for the Cause in your local 
Communities, to stress the need for the greatest love and 
unity amongst the &Baha'is themselves.  It is this love and 
spiritual solidarity that is so sadly lacking in the world 
today, and for which its people are starving.  When they see 
within the &Baha'i Community the true spirit of brotherhood 
 
+P126 
exemplified, they will turn to &Baha'u'llah and embrace His 
Message.  
     He also urges you to exert yourselves ceaselessly in the 
teaching field, and build up new &Baha'i centers, establish 
new spiritual assemblies, and convert the existing groups 
into assemblies by April of next year.  
     The Cause, we know, has a great future in Germany, and 
he assures you all he is constantly praying for the success of 
your devoted labours....  
 
          [From the Guardian:]  
Dear co-workers:  
     Your messages, eloquently testifying to the dynamic faith 
which inspires and sustains the German &Baha'i Community, 
now triumphantly emerging from its long and severe ordeal, 
rejoiced my heart, and served to deepen my feelings of 
affection and admiration for its members.  You who now 
stand on the threshold of a new era, have great tasks ahead 
of you and a glorious mission to fulfil.  The institutions you 
are now initiating and developing will no doubt enable you 
to achieve speedily and effectively your goal.  The Beloved is 
watching over you.  His love surrounds you, and His spirit 
sustains and guides you.  Persevere in your glorious task.  
Rest assured that my prayers will continue to be offered on 
your behalf, and be confident that &Baha'u'llah will aid you 
to achieve ultimate victory.  
                                                     Shoghi 
 
 
24 October 1947 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letters to our beloved Guardian, dated Dec. 4th, 
1946, Jan. 6th, March 19th, June 15th, Aug. 27th and 
 
+P127 
Sept. 28th, 1947, have all been received, and he has 
instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  He has also 
received a letter, on behalf of your secretary, written by Dr. 
&Koller-Jager, and enclosing an English translation of your 
minutes.  This was dated March 13th.  
     In regard to the various matters you have raised in these 
letters:  
     He noted the report of Mrs Grossmann about her meeting 
with the grandchild of &Subh-i-Azal.  He feels that the friends 
should as much as possible avoid her, as it is very unlikely 
she has anything but prejudice against &Baha'u'llah, in view 
of her background.  
     He deeply appreciated the message of love and loyalty 
you sent him on the occasion of the celebration of twenty-five 
years of Guardianship.  
     He is extremely pleased to see the way the Cause is 
spreading in Germany, and the steady growth in the number 
of the assemblies there.  This would be a remarkable 
achievement under normal circumstances, but in view of the 
weakened state of the health of the &Baha'is and the 
hardships they and their countrymen are undergoing, it is 
little short of heroic.  The &Baha'is everywhere are watching 
the labours of their German brothers and sisters with deep 
admiration.  
     Concerning your question about forming Spiritual 
Assemblies this year as soon as circumstances permit, and 
without waiting until April 21st, 1948:  he does not think 
this advisable.  In order to encourage the German friends, so 
long oppressed and prevented from serving, he made an 
exception last year, but this year he feels all assemblies 
should wait until April to hold their elections.  He has 
recently advised the European Teaching Committee to do 
likewise, as some of the pioneers were eager to form 
 
+P128 
assemblies as soon as 9 &Baha'is existed in a city of one of the 
goal countries!  
     He is pleased to hear you have strengthened and assisted 
the Nuremberg &Baha'is, and that there are now so many 
there.  Also he is glad to hear you are protecting them and 
the Cause from the misrepresentations and ambitions of 
Mr. ...  Great vigilance and wisdom is required in such 
matters.  
     Regarding the publication of books for use in Germany in 
Switzerland:  he feels that this is out of the question at 
present, owing to the fact that the exchange of Persian into 
Swiss money, (providing it could be made at all), would be 
prohibitively expensive.  You would lose far too much this 
way.  He, therefore, suggests that you get in touch with Mr. 
David Hofman of England, who is a publisher in a small 
way, and very anxious to be of help in printing &Baha'i 
Literature.  He is a member of the British N.S.A., and if you 
arrange some satisfactory way of having him print books or 
booklets for you, it will be easier and cheaper to transfer 
some of the money from &Tihran, for this purpose, to 
England.  The Guardian has already written Mr. Hofman he 
favours his doing this, if you and he can agree.  
     Unfortunately, owing to the fall in the value of the 
pound, the conversion of Persian money into American 
dollars involves considerable loss.  In view of this the 
Guardian is going to instruct Mr. &Varqa in &Tihran to send 
to the American N.S.A. five hundred pounds for the 
purpose of buying Care Packages, which will be sent to you 
for your use in securing the National Headquarters.  
     There is, in the special Fund held in &Tihran on behalf of 
your assembly, about ten thousand pounds.  He feels you 
should spend a third of this on your National Headquarters.  
But, as mentioned above, he advises you to try and go ahead 
 
+P129 
with the preliminary arrangements through using five 
hundred pounds in Care packages, and thus not lose too 
much of this money through the poor exchange at this time.  
     He leaves details of this matter to the discretion of your 
assembly, and hopes you will keep him informed of what 
action you have taken, and of the progress made in 
obtaining the National Headquarters.  
     He assures you all of his admiration for your steadfast 
labours to protect and promote every interest of our beloved 
Faith in Germany, and of his loving and ardent prayers for 
the success of your work....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dearly-beloved Friends:  
     The spirit which the entire body of the German believers 
have displayed, despite the hardships and trials which they 
have heroically endured, and are still enduring, is a 
magnificent example to their fellow-workers in both the 
East and the West, a source of great inspiration to me, and a 
magnet that will powerfully attract the blessings of the 
Almighty.  My thoughts, though I myself am immersed in an 
ocean of work and preoccupations, often turn in loving 
admiration and gratitude to those who, for more than a 
decade, have in the face of constant peril, held fast to the 
Faith of God, who have survived the greatest ordeal that has 
ever afflicted the Faith of &Baha'u'llah in the West, and who 
are now forging ahead, united, resolved and consecrated, in 
the path leading to still greater victories.  
     I rejoice to learn of the preliminary steps that are being 
taken to enable the dearly beloved and highly promising 
German &Baha'i Community to own its first National 
&Haziratu'l-Quds in the heart of that sorely-tried country.  
The utmost effort should be exerted to complete the present 
negotiations, and to initiate the national activities in that 
 
+P130 
centre.  I will, for my part, assist in any way possible, your 
assembly, in the historic enterprise which it has launched, 
and feel confident that the Beloved will bless your efforts, 
fulfil your highest expectations in this vital sphere of &Baha'i 
activity.  
     The dissemination of &Baha'i literature, is moreover, a 
matter of vital importance, which must be promoted by 
every means at your disposal.  The multiplication of &Baha'i 
centres, the formation of new assemblies, the consolidation 
of newly-established groups, constitute, likewise, the 
primary objective of your assembly, demanding constant 
exertion, watchfulness and guidance on your part, as well as 
full support and still greater sacrifice by the rank and file of 
the believers.  
     The promotion of the interests of the Austrian believers, 
owing to their proximity to your country, their past 
association with you and their practical isolation from the 
&Baha'i centres in East and West, should be regarded as one 
of your outstanding tasks, and I trust that every obstacle 
will be surmounted, enabling you to enrich thereby the 
record of your distinguished services to the Faith of 
&Baha'u'llah.  
     The path you are treading is hard and stony and beset 
with many pitfalls.  The tasks you are called upon to 
discharge are varied, complex, urgent and gigantic.  The 
resources at your disposal are meagre.  The hour, however, 
for raising the call of &Baha'u'llah is propitious.  The hearts of 
your countrymen, prepared by bewilderment and suffering, 
are ready to respond to His message.  You stand at the 
threshold of a new and glorious era in the evolution of His 
Faith in that land.  The opportunities of the present hour are 
priceless and may never recur again.  Time is pressing.  The 
eyes of your fellow-workers in both Hemispheres are fixed 
 
+P131 
upon you.  Our beloved Master who showered, through His 
visit and His messages to you, so much love and 
encouragement and so many blessings, is watching over you 
from on high, ready to sustain your efforts and lead you on 
to victory.  
     That you may rise to still greater heights of heroism, that 
you may discharge befittingly your sacred responsibilities, 
that you may adorn the annals of your Faith with still 
greater evidences of your devotion, courage and 
perseverance, that you may achieve your high destiny as the 
torch-bearers of the light of Divine Guidance to the 
neighbouring countries in that continent, is the object of my 
fervent prayers at the holy shrines, and the dearest wish of 
my heart.  
                                Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                         Shoghi 
 
 
15 November 1947 (Teaching Conference) 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your message to our beloved Guardian reached him, and 
he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf, and to tell 
you of how delighted he was to learn of your Teaching 
Conference.  
     Such gatherings are a great stimulation to the work of the 
Cause, and inspire the believers to go out and spread the 
Divine Message.  He hopes others will be held, as time goes 
by, in different parts of the Country, so that many more of 
the friends can attend them.  
     He assures you all of his loving prayers for your welfare 
and your &Baha'i work....  
 
+P132 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Beloved aid you to extend continually the range 
of your truly meritorious services, win memorable victories 
in the teaching field, and promote, in a most effective 
manner, the vital interests of the institutions of our glorious 
Faith, 
                                          Your true brother,

The &Baha'i Youth of Vienna 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your communication addressed to our beloved 
Guardian, and dated Jan. 25th, has been received, and he 
has instructed me to answer you all on his behalf.  
     He was most happy to see that there are so many &Baha'i 
Youth and children in Vienna.  Although your number may 
seem small to you, it is the beginning of something very 
important, the beginning of the spread of this Divine Faith 
amongst the youth of Austria.  
     He, therefore, urges you to persevere in your devotion to 
the Cause of God, to study its teachings deeply, and to mold 
your conduct into the pattern of true &Baha'i life.  
 
+P133 
     He will pray for you all, that God may bless, guide and 
protect you in every way....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     I was so glad to receive your message and to learn of your 
continued efforts in the service of our Beloved despite the 
severe trials you have suffered and are still suffering.  You 
are often in my thoughts and prayers, and I will supplicate 
the Beloved to guide your steps, remove every obstacle from 
your path, and aid you to extend the range of your valued 
activities, and win signal victories for His Cause and its 
institutions,

11 May 1948 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother:  
     Your communications, addressed to our beloved 
Guardian, and dated January 11th, February 14th, and 
March 31st, have been received, and he has instructed me to 
answer you on his behalf.  
     The progress the Faith is making in Germany is a source 
 
+P134 
of great happiness to him, and the list you sent him, 
showing the large increase in the number of assemblies, 
groups and isolated &Baha'is, greatly encouraged him, and he 
hastened to share this good news with the friends in other 
countries.  
     He was, likewise, very pleased to see that the Esslingen 
School is going to be so well attended, and that your 
assembly is so wisely making this spot a rallying point for 
&Baha'i Youth and their friends.  Upon receipt of your letter 
he cabled Mr. Holley to send the food parcels you required 
for the Summer School, and he hopes that these reach you 
safely.  
     He is delighted over the signs of maturity which are 
becoming increasingly evident in the German &Baha'i 
Community.  Not only is your membership steadily 
increasing and the number of your assemblies multiplying, 
but also the fact that most of the believers are realizing the 
need for breaking off their church membership and standing 
forth as members of an independent Faith; all these are 
welcome signs of progress and maturity.  And in view of this 
expansion in &Baha'i membership, and the consequent rapid 
increase in the number of Spiritual Assemblies, he feels that 
from now on you should increase the number of delegates, 
apportioned to the German and Austrian &Baha'i 
Community, from 19 to 38, (which is of course, twice 
nineteen.)  This will ensure a fairer representation of the 
numerical strength of the &Baha'is at their annual 
Convention, and enable the assemblies having a large 
community to receive more proportioned representation.  
     The Cause of God must be protected from the enemies of 
the Faith, and from those who sow seeds of doubt in the 
hearts of the believers, and the greatest of all protections is 
knowledge:  there is no doubt that the silliest of all charges 
 
+P135 
ever made is that the "Will and Testament" of the Master is a 
forgery!  It is all in His own hand, sealed in more than one 
place with His own seal, and was opened after His death by 
some members of His own family, who took it from His 
own safe, in this house, and from that day it has been kept 
in the safe under lock and key.  The charges of Mrs. White 
were the result of an unbalanced mind.  No other enemy, 
even those who were shrewd and clever, made this foolish 
accusation!  The case of &Ahmad Sohrab is, for one who has 
had any experience of orientals and of psychology, easily 
understandable.  He was, for some years the secretary of 
&Abdu'l-Baha and enjoyed, as a result of this and the fact 
that he accompanied Him to America, (to be sure with a 
number of other Persians), a great deal of attention from the 
&Baha'is who looked up to him and admired him.  However, 
since the Master's Will was read, and the administrative 
order, under the Guardianship, began to be developed, he 
became cognizant of the fact that his personal ambition for 
leadership would have to be subordinated to some degree of 
supervision; that he would have to obey the National and 
local assemblies--just like every other &Baha'i, and could 
not be free to teach wholly independent of any advice or 
supervision.  This was the beginning of the defection which 
in the end took him outside the pale of the Faith:  he refused 
not to be handled always as an exception, a privileged 
exception.  In fact, if we keenly analyse it, it is almost 
invariably the soaring ambition and deep self-love of people 
that has led them to leave the Faith.  Towards the end 
Sohrab used, in the course of his lectures, to incorporate 
quotation after quotation of &Baha'u'llah's words in his 
lectures, without once stating they were &Baha'u'llah's, and 
when the believers remonstrated with him over this 
plagiarism, it had no effect.  After he had, of his own accord, 
 
+P136 
left the organized body of the Faith and refused to be 
reconciled with it, he began to attack the administrators of 
it, first the American N.S.A., then the entire administrative 
order, and in the end the Guardian.  What he teaches at 
present is so far divorced from our beloved Faith, and so 
tinged with the doctrines of many "cults" which we see 
thriving at present, as to be almost unrecognizable.  Sohrab's 
influence and activities in America have waned greatly, and 
he seems to now feel his only chance of causing mischief is 
to be active with his "caravan" movement abroad.  The 
books and articles he published attacking the Guardian and, 
in fact, everything established in the Master's Will, had no 
effect, and far from succeeding in causing any breach in the 
Faith in America, some of the very few who followed him 
out of the Cause, gave him up, and returned to serve the 
Cause with redoubled enthusiasm!  
     The Guardian feels that one of the best antidotes to those
--Sohrab or others--who seek to undermine the faith of 
the believers, especially by harping on the subject of 
excommunication, is to place in their hands a German 
edition of "God Passes By".  For in that book he (the 
Guardian) has clearly pointed out that the Cause of God has 
always been attacked from within, and that, beginning in 
the days of the &Bab, the "Sea of Truth" has over and over 
cast out its spiritually dead.  It must do this, even as the body 
seeks to rid itself of poisons so as to preserve the health of 
the entire organism.  
     Your assembly should do all it can to protect and educate 
the believers so that they will understand that it is not 
personal ill-will, or lack of love, which leads to the 
excommunication of a person, but rather the fact that he 
has become like a cancer which must be removed before the 
entire body is destroyed.  
 
+P137 
     He is very anxious to have the work on the National 
Headquarters in Frankfurt a.M. reported to him, and to 
receive pictures of the building purchased, for publication in 
"&Baha'i World".  
     The way the work your Assembly is doing is progressing, 
pleases him greatly, and he assures you all of his loving 
prayers on your behalf, for your protection and your 
success....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     The marvellous progress achieved in recent months by the 
virile, steadfast and dearly beloved German &Baha'i 
community has rejoiced my heart, and deepened the 
admiration of the followers of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah in 
every land, for the qualities of mind and heart that 
distinguish the adherents of this Cause in your country.  
     The marvellous increase in the number of newly-enrolled 
believers, the multiplication of groups and assemblies 
throughout the length and breadth of your land, the 
purchase and projected restoration of the national 
&Haziratu'l-Quds in the city of Frankfurt, the impetus lent to 
the translation and publication of &Baha'i Literature, the 
receptivity shown by your country-men to the teachings of 
&Baha'u'llah, the consolidation of the various agencies of a 
steadily expanding Administrative Order in the various 
zones of your country--all these augur well for the 
complete fulfilment of &Abdu'l-Baha's glorious prophecies 
regarding its future.  
     The doubling of the number of delegates to the next 
&Baha'i national convention will eloquently testify to this 
remarkable growth and rapid consolidation of the 
community you are privileged to serve and direct.  The 
interests of the Austrian &Baha'i community should, while 
 
+P138 
the work is steadily progressing in Germany, be vigilantly 
and determinedly promoted.  Through guidance, assistance, 
encouragement, frequent visits when ever possible, the 
community of the believers in Austria should be nursed and 
prepared to discharge befittingly its sacred responsibilities, 
until such time, as has been the case with Canada, as it can 
elect its own national assembly and assume independent 
existence within the world-wide &Baha'i community.  
     At this propitious moment in the evolution of the Faith in 
your country, at a time when the American, the British, the 
Indian, the Persian, the Australian, the Canadian and &Iraqi 
national &Baha'i communities are busily engaged in 
prosecuting specially conceived Plans for the systematic 
propagation of the Faith within their respective countries 
and beyond their confines, it is only fitting for a community 
as old and honoured as yours, which has survived such cruel 
blows, which occupies so enviable a position in the heart of 
Europe, the recipient of so great a measure of bounty and 
loving-kindness from &Abdu'l-Baha, to formulate its own 
Plan, preferably a five year Plan, destined to culminate in 
1953, the hundredth anniversary of the birth of 
&Baha'u'llah's Mission in the &Siyah-Chal of &Tihran.  
     As to the objectives of the Plan, in both Germany and 
Austria, I feel that your assembly should carefully consider 
them, and after mature deliberation announce them to the 
believers and ensure, by every means in its power, the 
attainment of every goal you set yourselves to achieve.  
     The launching of such a Plan, after the consolidation of 
the institutions of the Faith, during the three years that have 
elapsed since the termination of the war, will constitute a 
landmark in the history of the Faith in that country, and 
will, no doubt act as a tremendous magnet, drawing the 
blessings of &Baha'u'llah, and contributing, to an 
 
+P139 
unprecedented degree, to the establishment of His Cause in 
the heart of Europe.  
     I long to hear the joyful tidings announcing the 
formulation and inauguration of such a Plan, which will 
greatly stimulate the followers of &Baha'u'llah in East and 
West, and enrich the annals of His Faith during the opening 
decade of the second &Baha'i century.  
     May the Spirit of our beloved Master, watching from on 
high over the destinies of this highly promising, this richly 
endowed community, enable it to usher in this new phase of 
internal development of His Father's Faith in that country, 
in a manner that will redound to the fame and glory of His 
German-speaking followers.

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of Aug. 29th, with translation of some 
enclosures, was received by our beloved Guardian, and he 
has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     Regarding the matter of the Fund for Germany now held 
in &Tihran:  Unfortunately the exchange rate of the Persian 
 
+P140 
&Tuman into Swiss (or American or British) money is 
extremely unfavourable, and he considers that your loss 
would be far too great to transfer, at the present time, the 
entire sum from &Tihran to Switzerland.  It is also extremely 
difficult to get money out of Persia, which now has financial 
restrictions similar to so many other countries.  However, he 
is investigating at the present moment the possibility of 
having a sum to meet your immediate requirements 
transfered from Persia to Switzerland, and the moment he 
can arrange this he will notify your assembly.  
     The devoted services of the &Baha'i youth rendered in 
clearing the &Hazira property of debris, was much 
appreciated by him, and he wishes you to please let them 
know he admires their spirit which is demonstrated in such 
a useful manner!  
     He was very sorry to hear of the sad and untimely death 
of dear Mrs. Brauns-Forel.  Her services, always rendered 
with such unflagging devotion, will be sorely missed by her 
co-workers in Germany.  He hopes her daughter will arise to 
take her mother's place in the active work of the Cause.  
     He trusts that now your assembly is able to render more 
active assistance to the Austrian believers and to stimulate 
them in their work.  Recent reports seem to indicate the 
Vienna &Baha'is are more active and determined than ever 
before in their history.  
     He hopes the construction of the &Hazira in Frankfurt will 
now be able to go ahead at a rapid pace.  You may be sure he 
will do all he can to assist you in this essential enterprise.  
     You are all remembered in his prayers with much love, 
and he is very pleased over the way the Faith is progressing 
in Germany....  
 
+P141 
          [From the Guardian:]
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     I am delighted to hear of the energetic steps that have 
been taken in recent months in connexion with the establishment 
of the &Haziratu'l-Quds in Frankfurt.  This institution, 
the center round which all national &Baha'i activities 
must revolve, should be made the object of the special care 
and solicitude of the entire community of the German believers 
in the years immediately ahead.  Upon it will depend the 
coordination, consolidation and expansion of the collective 
efforts of the members of this community, which occupies 
so vital and pivotal a position in the heart of the European 
continent.  Parallel with this conscious, this determined and 
persistent effort, assiduous endeavours must be constantly 
and increasingly exerted by your assembly to multiply the 
administrative centres, increase the number of the active 
supporters of the Faith, proclaim its verities wisely, unreservedly, 
far and wide, disseminate its literature, vigorously 
and systematically, and deepen, by every possible means, 
the understanding and the devotion of its adherents.  That 
these immediate objectives may be speedily attained, and 
enable the members of this valiant and sore-tried community 
to embark on a carefully conceived Plan in the years that 
lie ahead, is my fervent and constant prayer.  
                                 Your true and grateful brother 
                                                         Shoghi

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated September 
9th, was received, and he has instructed me to answer you 
on his behalf.  
 
+P142 
     He was delighted to see so many of the dear German 
friends had attended the school, for in this loving &Baha'i 
association and study a closer unity is created amongst the 
believers, and new plans born for the teaching work that lies 
ahead.  
     He urges you all to exert every effort to spread the Faith 
in these dark days of crisis the world is still passing through, 
for in the teachings of &Baha'u'llah alone can the people find 
hope, peace and comfort.  
     He assures you all of his most loving prayers on your 
behalf, and for the success of your devoted services....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     Your joint message truly cheered my heart and served to 
remind me of the great company of my dearly-beloved 
brethren who have toiled so devotedly in the past, and are 
so energetically pursuing their historic tasks at present, in 
the service of our glorious Faith, I will continue to 
supplicate the Beloved to bless continually your high 
endeavours, to enable you to extend the range of your 
splendid activities, and to lend a tremendous impetus to the 
onward march of the Faith in your promising country, 
                              Your true and grateful brother

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated Sept. 15th, 
was received, and he wishes me to thank you on his behalf 
for your loving thought in sending him birthday greetings.  
 
+P143 
     He was very pleased to see the Esslingen School program, 
and to note that four sessions were being held in the 
summer.  This school is a rallying point for the German 
believers, and greatly stimulates their unity and their 
enthusiasm.  
     The world outlook is so dark and over-clouded that the 
believers must labour day and night to give the people the 
message of &Baha'u'llah, and instill in them some hope for the 
future.  We can see more and more of the predictions of the 
beloved Master being fulfilled, as humanity persists in its 
waywardness and spiritual blindness.  There is no other 
remedy except this Cause.  
     He assures you all of his most loving prayers, and he 
deeply appreciates your devoted services....  
 
     P.S.  I am sending through you the Guardian's answer to 
the Esslingen Summer School attendants, as their envelope 
had no address on it.  Please share it with the friends.  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Beloved of our hearts guide and sustain you, 
reward you abundantly for your valiant deeds, aid you to 
extend the range of your beneficent services, and enable you 
to contribute, continually and effectively, to the 
multiplication and consolidation of the institutions of our 
glorious Faith, 
                           Your true and grateful brother,

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your loving message, sent to our beloved Guardian from 
the 8th Summer School of Esslingen, was received, and he 
has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He was very glad to see dear Mr. Remey had been present 
at that occasion, as he is a faithful and devoted old believer, 
and has been serving the Cause since its earliest inception in 
the West.  
     He urges you all to concentrate your efforts on the all-important 
work of teaching the Cause and spreading it to

     You may be sure he will pray for you all in the Holy 
Shrines, and for the success of your labours....

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter to our beloved Guardian was for some time 
held up in reaching him.  But he was most happy to see so 
many of the dear friends had gathered at Esslingen school 
for the 3rd session.  
     It is most encouraging to see the way this important 
institution has grown since the end of the war and became a 
focus for &Baha'i students.  He hopes it is the foreshadowing of 
a true &Baha'i University which some day must form part of 
the activities of our glorious Faith.  
     The Guardian urges you, one and all, to work together, 
in the utmost unity and love, to spread the Message 
throughout Germany, and particularly to teach the Youth 
and enlist them in the ranks of the Faith.  
     He will pray for you all in the Holy Shrines....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Spirit of &Baha'u'llah guide and sustain you in 
your labours, enable you to extend continually the range of 
your valued activities, deepen your knowledge and 
understanding of the essential verities of His Faith, and aid 
 
+P146

30 June 1949 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letters to our beloved Guardian, dated Oct. 17, 22, 
Dec. 19--two of this date--Nov. 21, 23, 1948 and Jan. 
9, 23, Feb. 28 and May 4, 15, of 1949, as well as their 
numerous enclosures, have all been received and I am 
instructed on his behalf to answer them.  He regrets the long 
delay in replying to you, but he is very busy, and he was also 
anxious to receive as complete a picture of the situation as 
possible in order to better advise you on the difficult 
situation which has arisen.  
     Before going into this matter he wishes to assure you that 
he was delighted with the 5 Year Plan your assembly has 
formulated, to which he attaches great importance.  
     Likewise, he was very pleased that the annual convention, 
though not a very happy one, unfortunately, was held in 
Frankfurt.  
     He was, likewise, very happy to learn that the N.S.A. is 
now in full accord with ... about the work on the National 
&Hazira in Frankfurt, and to hear that the transfer of funds 
from &Tihran via Switzerland to your assembly had been 
worked out in the way most advantageous for you.  
     The good news that the much needed Esslemont books 
are now in Germany, and the "Hidden Words" being 
printed there, was also very welcome.  He cabled you in 
answer to your letter about the "Hidden Words".  But 
wishes to make it quite clear that the "Anmerkungen" is not 
correct.  The genuflections and washing of hands and face 
(as clearly put down in "Prayers and Meditations of 
&Baha'u'llah", which he himself translated,) associated with 
the two longer daily prayers (obligatory prayers) are laws of 
 
+P149 
&Baha'u'llah, applicable to any &Baha'i whether of Muslim 
background, Christian background, or otherwise.  It is 
blasphemy to suggest otherwise.  However, the &Baha'is have 
been left free by &Baha'u'llah to choose one of the 3 
obligatory prayers, and those who prefer not to perform 
these acts can say the very short one.  He would like to add, 
however, that he deeply appreciates the work done on this 
translation by ... and other of the friends, and is delighted it 
has been published.  
     He very deeply appreciates your assembly's assurance of 
its abiding loyalty to him and to the Master's Will and 
Testament.  As you can well imagine this disaffection of the 
Master's Family has been a very sad and heavy blow to 
him; but, although for many years he shielded them with his 
silence, in the end he was forced to speak out in order to 
protect the Faith.  For a hundred years our beloved Cause 
has suffered from these internal afflictions, and the way the 
believers, generation after generation, have met this test 
with steadfast faith, loyalty and devotion, is one of the signs 
that this is the Cause of God, divinely protected through the 
Covenants of &Baha'u'llah and the Master.  
     Regarding the crisis which has arisen among the believers 
because of the charges made by ... and others, the circular 
letter issued by your body, etc, etc.  
     The Guardian feels that although there is no doubt this 
has produced a very grave situation, threatening the 
stability and the unity of the entire community, it can be 
successfully overcome and lead to a new stage of unity and 
progress in the Faith in Germany.  We &Baha'is can always, 
with the aid of &Baha'u'llah, Who is ever ready to strengthen 
and assist us, turn our stumbling blocks into stepping 
stones, and utilize the often violent forces released by 
sincere but perhaps misguided friends, as a positive stream 
 
+P150 
of power by turning them into productive channels instead 
of destructive ones.  
     Fundamentally he feels that the cause of this present crisis 
arises from the fact that the German community so long 
suppressed, disorganized, deprived of literature, and the 
visits of friends from countries where the believers have 
always been free to be &Baha'is and have, consequently, 
evolved their administration of the Faith's affairs to a higher 
point of efficiency,--has had no opportunity to develop the 
administration of its &Baha'i affairs, and also, no opportunity 
of maturing as &Baha'is living within a smoothly-working 
Administrative Order.  Consequently the troubles experienced 
at present may be said to be largely caused by 
immaturity in their understanding of the administration.  
     Linked with this is the fact, which he mentioned in his 
cable, that the &Baha'is need to be deepened in their 
knowledge and understanding of the Will and Testament of 
&Abdu'l-Baha.  They should study this, and the Dispensation 
of &Baha'u'llah, for it is obvious that they do not--for the 
most part--fully visualize the greatness, the glory, the 
power and the protection which have been conferred on this 
Faith through the Institutions provided for in the Master's 
Will.  
     In going over the correspondence and documents 
forwarded by your Assembly (which he appreciated 
receiving as it gave him a clearer picture of the entire 
situation) he was struck by the actions and statements, of 
both individuals and assemblies, showing a complete lack of 
knowledge of how to function administratively.  In view of 
this it may, if the friends make an effort and sincerely seek 
to unite and progress, prove providential that this whole 
thing has occurred.  He was impressed, in this connection, 
with the wisdom and tolerance of the remarks of Mr. Oskar 
 
+P151 
Schmitt in his letter to your Assembly, and he hopes that all 
of the believers will take this kindly and tolerant view, for 
the friends, in their desire to do the right thing, and 
undoubtedly out of their genuine devotion to the Cause, 
seem to have gone to every extreme in their reactions.  In 
doing this they have paradoxically demonstrated both their 
devotion to the Cause and their complete lack of a profound 
understanding of the administration.  
     Quite frankly, the Guardian feels that the circular letter of 
your Assembly was unfortunate.  You were entirely within 
your right, as the National Body, to issue such a letter and 
the violent reactions of the secretaries of various assemblies, 
and some of the assemblies themselves, and many individual 
believers as well, showed a complete lack of understanding 
of administrative procedure.  The friends should realize that 
the National Body has authority over the local assemblies 
and the believers in administrative matters.  One of the 
fundamentals involved in our administrative order, which 
we must remember will become the pattern for our World 
Order, is that even if an assembly makes an ill-advised 
decision it must be upheld in order to preserve the unity of 
the community.  Appeal can be made from the Local 
Assembly's decision to the National Assembly, and from the 
National Assembly's decision to the Guardian.  But the 
principle of authority invested in our elected bodies must be 
upheld.  This is not something which can be learned without 
trial and test.  The &Baha'is in other countries often have their 
difficulties in learning to live as believers in an orderly 
community, governed by the administrative principles laid 
down by the Master.  But, having been free, they have, for 
the most part, reached a more mature understanding than 
their German brothers and sisters have up until the present 
time.  He hopes this whole episode will stimulate the 
 
+P152 
German assemblies and believers to really study the &Baha'i 
administration.  
     He wrote the ... Assembly urging upon them the necessity 
of cooperating with the National Assembly.  He also pointed 
out to them that the attitude of "all for one and one for all" 
was very incorrect.  An assembly constitutes within its area 
of jurisdiction the Trustees of the Faith.  Its members must at 
all times put the interests of the Faith above personality and 
impartially go into any matter brought to its attention.  
Theoretically it is always possible for a member of an 
assembly to be unworthy or insincere.  To take the attitude 
that any blame cast upon or any charge made against an 
assembly member is a charge against the body itself is very 
wrong.  An assembly must protect the Faith and neither 
blindly accuse nor blindly defend one of its members.  The 
... Assembly has taken the attitude that the remarks 
referring to ... are an insult to the entire Assembly; at the 
same time it accuses the National Body of being dominated 
by one individual, an accusation which because of its own 
attitude could equally well be aimed at itself!  The Guardian 
feels that all this is only evidence of the immaturity of the 
friends in relation to their Administrative Order.  
     The &Baha'is must learn to forget personalities and to 
overcome the desire--so natural in people--to take sides 
and fight about it.  They must also learn to really make use 
of the great principle of consultation.  There is a time set 
aside at the 19 Day Feasts for the Community to express its 
views and make suggestions to its Assembly; the Assembly 
and the believers should look forward to this happy period 
of discussion, and neither fear it nor suppress it.  Likewise 
the Assembly members should fully consult, and in their 
decisions put the interests of the Cause first and not 
personalities, the will of the majority prevailing.  
 
+P153 
     Over and over, in going through the correspondence he 
received from your Assembly, he was struck by the fact that 
the friends acted so unadministratively.  Instead of taking up 
their accusations and problems and unhappy feelings with 
their local Assembly, or the National Assembly, they 
referred to individuals or individual members of the 
Assembly, or they refused to meet with the Assembly.  The 
first thing a believer should do is to turn to an Assembly--
That is why we have assemblies!  He feels this trouble would 
never have arisen if the &Baha'is utilized their assemblies as 
they should.  One of the healing remedies &Baha'u'llah has 
given to a sick world is the Assembly (which in future will 
become a House of Justice); its members have very sacred 
and heavy responsibilities, its power to steer the 
Community, to protect and assist its members is likewise 
very great.  
     ..., a most loyal and devoted believer has assured the 
Guardian she will fully support and cooperate with the 
N.S.A.  He hopes you will give her every assistance in this 
resolve and, indeed, encourage her to stimulate the believers 
in their support of their administrative bodies and teach 
them to turn to them and make better use of them.  
     In this connection he would like to point out that any 
&Baha'i can write to him directly.  This is the privilege of 
everyone.  
     He feels that ..., a most loyal and devoted servant of the 
Cause, communicated with ... in her ardent, and very wise 
desire, to promote closer unity among the German friends.  
He feels your Assembly should over-look this, as the motive 
was undoubtedly a very noble one.  
     He was very glad to receive the letter of ... and he feels 
sure he will do all in his power do dispel the impression of 
 
+P154 
his attitude towards the Covenant, which has been spread 
about among some of the friends....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     The course of recent developments in the life of the 
German &Baha'i community has given rise to considerable 
anxiety and caused me grave concern, in view of the 
eminent position which the collective achievements of its 
members have enabled it to obtain on the morrow of the 
severest crisis which it has experienced in its history.  
     The spiritual vitality which the individual lives of its 
members have so abundantly demonstrated, the resilience of 
which it has, as an organized body, shown itself to be 
capable, the soundness of the foundation on which its 
collective life has been built in the years preceding the great 
ordeal which it has survived; the remarkable rapidity with 
which it has rehabilitated its fortunes since the cessation 
of hostilities, have evoked in every &Baha'i heart feelings 
of profound affection and admiration for both the representatives 
of that community and the mass of believers 
constituting the body of the faithful in that land.  
     The hopes that have been raised must never be allowed by 
those who actively participate in the life of so virile a 
community to be disappointed.  The structure now being 
reared so laboriously on so solid a foundation must, under 
no circumstances, be jeopardized through neglect, dissension 
or deviation from established principles whether spiritual 
or administrative in character.  The process that has 
been set in motion, after so long a period of forced 
inactivity, which is lending so great an impetus to the 
multiplication of the institutions of the Faith and their 
consolidation, must, in no wise be arrested or even retarded 
through any misunderstanding, insubordination or 
 
+P155 
contention between the voting members of the community 
and its elected representatives whether local or national.  
     A strict and undeviating adherence to the spiritual laws 
and administrative principles constituting the bedrock of the 
Faith; a constant and complete awareness of the nature, 
the sacredness and vital importance of the Covenants 
established successively by &Baha'u'llah and &Abdu'l-Baha; an 
immediate cessation of every controversy agitating the life 
of that community in the present and critical stage in its 
development; close cooperation, complete harmony and 
continued understanding between the various agencies, 
whether assemblies or communities participating in its 
evolution; concentration on the immediate measures 
required to ensure the total success of the newly launched 
Five Year Plan, on the part of all its members and their 
elected representatives; constant vigilance on the part of 
each and every one of the adherents of the Faith to avoid 
any act, word or association that would violate its integrity, 
break its laws, subvert its administrative order, or retard its 
progress and consolidation--these stand out as the urgent, 
the sacred and inescapable obligations and responsibilities 
facing its promoters at this fateful hour in their history.  
     The immediate past, with all its confused issues and 
unpleasant memories must be entirely forgotten, if the task 
that lies ahead is to be efficiently prosecuted.  Personal 
animosities, suspicions, accusations, wounded pride, 
controversial issues must all be laid aside.  Members of 
assemblies, national and local, must be the first to set a 
worthy example to their fellow-believers.  All thought and 
discussion must henceforth centre around the measures 
required to stimulate the growth of the Faith, to deepen and 
enrich the spiritual life of its members, to familiarize them 
more intimately with the character and workings of the 
 
+P156 
Administrative Order, and enable them to participate more 
actively in the prosecution of the Plan to which they are 
committed.  
     I appeal to them, with all my heart, to close their ranks, 
purge their hearts, broaden their vision, renew their 
determination, rededicate themselves to their glorious task, 
march resolutely forward along the road traced for them by 
&Abdu'l-Baha, beat down every barrier obstructing their 
path, and press on, confidently, unitedly and uncompromisingly, 
until their goal is attained, and the first stage 
in the evolution of their collective task is brought to a 
victorious conclusion.  
     May the Beloved Who loved them so dearly, Who 
participated personally in the initial stage of their evolution, 
Who cherished such bright hopes for their future and 
uttered such noble prophecies concerning the greatness of

3 July 1949 (First Pioneer School) 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your message, sent from your school session to our 
beloved Guardian, reached him, and he has instructed me to 
answer it on his behalf, and to assure you he was delighted 
to see that such a school for pioneering had been held.  
     He was also very glad to see that the believers are 
studying the Covenant of the Master.  For in the Master's 
Will and Testament are enshrined the principles underlying 
the World Order, and unless the believers fully grasp the 
 
+P157 
greatness, functions, and purpose of the institutions 
outlined in that Testament (and elaborated by the Guardian 
in his book "The Dispensation of &Baha'u'llah") they will not 
be able to properly function as &Baha'is individually or 
collectively.  The German friends need to acquire a profound 
understanding of the &Baha'i Administrative Order to enable 
them to function as a Community, according to &Baha'i laws, 
and to protect them from tests and the attacks of the 
enemies of the Faith....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear co-workers:  
     I was so pleased and encouraged to receive your message 
and to learn of the activity you have initiated.  I will pray for 
its success and extension from the depths of my heart.  
Persevere in your labours, and rest assured that you will be 
guided, sustained and fully rewarded for your meritorious 
and timely accomplishments, 
                                    Your true brother, 
                                               Shoghi 
 
 
4 September 1949 (Summer School) 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter reached our beloved Guardian, and he was 
delighted to see so many believers and friends were present 
at the July session of the School, and also to note the 
excellent courses you were given by the teachers and visitors 
present at the School.  
     He was also very pleased to see the program for the Youth 
Week being held in the Schwarzwald, and the emphasis 
which is being placed on teaching the Covenant in both 
Esslingen and this Youth week he considers very important.  
 
+P158 
     The German &Baha'is, like all the believers everywhere, 
will be strong, united and protected to the degree to which 
they are firm in the Covenants of both &Baha'u'llah and the 
Master.  
     He hopes the teaching work in Germany will make great 
progress, and he urges you all to devote yourselves to this 
mighty task, and to promoting love and unity amongst the 
&Baha'is and a better understanding of the administrative 
order of our Faith....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear co-workers:  
     Your joint message brought joy and gladness to my heart 
and was a powerful reminder of the staunchness of the faith 
of the dearly-beloved German believers, their constancy and 
determination, their thoroughness and diligency in the study 
of the Faith and of its teachings, and their devotion to the 
interests of its institutions.  I will supplicate the Beloved on 
your behalf to enable you to acquire a still deeper 
understanding of the essentials of His Revelation, and to 
promote, with increasing effectiveness, the best interests of 
His Cause, 
                                    Your true and grateful brother, 
                                                            Shoghi

28 June 1950 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letters addressed to our beloved Guardian and dated 
May 26, June 29, August 30 from Mr. Gollmer, November 
19, December 7, of 1949, and January 15, February 15, 
and April 18, of 1950, have been received, as well as their 
enclosures and other material and photographs sent, and he 
has instructed me to answer them on his behalf.  
     The past winter and spring have been very difficult for 
our beloved Guardian, and this is why he has not been able 
to reply to you, (or to any other National Assembly), for 
so long.  As you know, he has been carrying on the 
construction of the first stage, the arcade, of the &Bab's 
Shrine in anticipation of having it finished for the July 9 
Centenary Celebrations of His Martyrdom.  This necessitated 
 
+P160 
a great deal of excavation of the solid rock behind the 
Shrine in order to enable the arcade to be built.  The 
Guardian himself supervised this work in order to see it 
was done the most economical way and as quickly as 
possible; this took up a great deal of his time and energy.  
     At the beginning of April, just when he was planning to 
devote himself to the correspondence of the various 
N.S.A.'s, Mr. Maxwell, the architect of the Shrine, became 
very dangerously ill, and until the present time is in Hospital 
with special nurses day and night.  His condition is now very 
much better, but the constant worry, and the problems 
arising daily, have hitherto prevented our Guardian and his 
secretary from answering any mail.  He wishes you to know 
that these are the reasons you have not heard from him for 
so long.  
     In regard to certain matters you raised in your letters:  he 
does not consider it necessary to publish at present "This 
Earth One Country"; there are other books more urgently 
needed by the German friends such as "Some Answered 
Questions" and the "Paris Talks" of the Master.  
     He sees no objection to your Assembly's renting to 
suitable tenants some of the rooms in the &Hazira of 
Frankfurt in order to assist you in financing its construction.  
Also he feels you are free to rent the &Baha'i Hall in that 
building to groups, who have similar aims to ours, or to the 
University.  
     As to purchasing the property next door:  although this 
would be desirable, he feels at present it is out of the 
question, as you have not got sufficient funds to do so, and 
are already having difficulty meeting the heavy expenses 
involved in building the &Hazira itself.  
     The Guardian has already had a sum transferred to Mr. 
Hofman to meet the expenses of publishing "God Passes 
 
+P161 
By".  He trusts this important work will soon be in your 
hands, as it will be of great educational value to the German 
believers.  They are, he feels, just the people to appreciate 
such a weighty history and review of the Faith.  
     The whole-hearted response made by the German &Baha'is 
to his appeal last year to become united and to deepen their 
understanding of the Covenant pleases him greatly.  He feels 
this has demonstrated anew the loyalty and faith of this 
Community, and justifies his hopes for the brilliant future 
he is convinced lies ahead of them.  
     The entire Community of friends in Austria and Germany 
should now concentrate on fulfilling their Plan.  The success 
of the American friends, the remarkable victory of the 
British &Baha'is and the Persian believers, the progress being 
made by the distant communities in Australia and New 
Zealand, as well as India, Pakistan and Burma, should 
encourage them to gird up their loins and crown their own 
efforts with victory.  
     The Guardian feels sure that, now that a greater degree of 
unity has been achieved by the German believers, they will 
find that God gives them far greater strength to carry out 
their work for His Faith.  He assures you he will pray for all 
the friends to become increasingly as one soul labouring in 
many bodies.  
     He will also pray for all the members of your Assembly 
to be strengthened to perform your historic work 
successfully....  
     P.S.  He thanks you for the map showing &Baha'i 
distribution in Germany and Austria, and will publish it in 
the next edition of "&Baha'i World".  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     The progress achieved by the German &Baha'i community 
 
+P162 
in recent months, under the able direction, and through the 
constant vigilance and loving care of its elected national 
representatives, is highly gratifying and fills me with hope, 
gratitude and admiration for the sterling qualities that 
distinguish its members in their steadfast service to the Faith 
of &Baha'u'llah.  The restoration of harmony and cooperation 
among the dearly loved, high-minded, great-hearted 
German believers, the vigorous prosecution of their newly-adopted 
Plan, the gradual restoration of their newly 
purchased &Haziratu'l-Quds, the steady extension in the 
range of their publications, and the notable multiplication 
and consolidation of their rehabilitated institutions, are the 
latest evidences of the unconquerable spirit and indomitable 
faith which have consistently animated them in the past, 
and which have enabled them to weather, in the course of 
the last world conflict, the severest storm that has afflicted 
them since the inception of the Faith in their land.  
     The process of harmonious cooperation and the spirit of 
mutual understanding, remarkably evident in the life of a 
newly resuscitated, highly promising, spiritually enriched 
community must, particularly in its relation with the local 
communities in Hamburg and Vienna, be steadily fostered, 
however great the obstacles that may be encountered.  The 
education of the members of the community in the 
principles and essential verities underlying the Covenants of 
&Baha'u'llah and &Abdu'l-Baha as well as the Administrative 
Order of the Faith--the twin pillars sustaining the spiritual 
life and the institutions of every organized &Baha'i 
community--must, at all costs, be vigorously pursued 
and systematically intensified.  The multiplication and 
consolidation of &Baha'i administrative institutions, in both 
zones under the jurisdiction of the elected representatives of 
the community, and in the neighbouring territory of Austria, 
 
+P163 
must be given a fresh impetus through repeated exertions 
and carefully devised measures.  The initial steps, aiming at 
the incorporation of the National Assembly and of every 
soundly grounded properly functioning local assembly, 
should be promptly taken, as a prelude to the establishment 
of the national and local &Baha'i endowments for the benefit 
of the entire community.  The utmost effort should be 
exerted to hasten, on the one hand, the completion of the 
restoration of the national administrative Headquarters, 
and centralize, on the other, the national activities and 
manifold agencies of the Faith in that newly-appointed 
centre established in the heart of that country.  Particular 
attention should, moreover, be given to the vital city of 
Berlin, its needs, its interests and future prospects.  The 
teaching work, the cornerstone of the &Baha'i Edifice and the 
primary purpose of every &Baha'i institution, so emphatically 
stressed by &Abdu'l-Baha in His Will, should, above all, 
be reinvigorated and relentlessly expanded.  A closer 
association through correspondence, attendance at Summer 
Schools, participation at Teaching Conferences and 
collaboration in publications should be carefully fostered 
with the sister communities now rapidly emerging on the 
European continent, in the British Isles, in the North and 
South American continents, in Asia, Africa and Australasia.  
     To these immediate tasks, so vital, so sacred, a 
community, purged in the fires of suffering, revitalized and 
functioning with unity, zeal, fidelity and enthusiasm, must 
address itself without delay, with complete dedication and 
renewed and undefected resolve, as a prelude to the future 
unfoldment of its mission, beyond the confines of its 
homeland.  For a national community so vibrant with life, so 
painstaking in its labours, so efficient in its methods, so 
impervious to the slings and arrows of affliction, occupying 
 
+P164 
so central a position in a continent, so politically confused, 
so spiritually starved, so socially agitated, and the recipient 
of such favours and promises, from the lips and pen of 
&Abdu'l-Baha, cannot, if faithful to its destiny, remain 
confined in its future activities, to the narrow compass of its 
homeland, and fall behind its sister communities in East and 
West, which are forging ahead and are in addition to their 
tasks at home, carrying forward the banner of the Faith in 
both distant lands and neighbouring territories, such as 
Latin America, the Goal countries of Europe, the 
Dependencies in the Far North, the Territories of the 
Arabian Peninsula, Central, East and West Africa, the 
Islands of the Pacific and South East Asia.  
     Already this community has, in the years preceding the 
great ordeal to which it has been subjected, initiated in 
however tentative a manner, its teaching enterprises beyond 
the confines of its homeland in one of the neighbouring 
Balkan Territories, and laid to rest, as an everlasting 
memorial to its pioneering spirit, the remains of its first 
martyr in the soil of that Territory.  
     No more adequate and better field can be imagined, as an 
outlet for the long-hemmed in energies of a spiritually virile, 
highly developed outstandingly loyal branch of the family of 
&Baha'i national communities, than the neighbouring 
territories situated in the Balkan Peninsula, the Baltic States, 
and further afield the vast stretches now enveloped in 
darkness, and whose teeming millions hunger for the Light 
of God's saving grace and redemptive power.  
     For so glorious and mighty a mission, this community, 
however limited its present resources, however circumscribed 
in its numbers, however formidable the various 
obstacles that now stand in its path, must, by applying itself 
assiduously to the tasks of the present hour, prepare itself 
 
+P165 
and acquire the necessary spiritual capacity to launch, in the 
years that lie ahead and possibly on the morrow of the 
celebrations of the centenary of the birth of &Baha'u'llah's 
prophetic Mission, the first stage in its historic Mission 
destined to embrace so vital a section of the European, and 
so colossal an area in the Asiatic, continents.  May this 
community prove itself worthy of its high destiny.

NONATTENDANCE FEAST DOES NOT JUSTIFY SUSPENSION 
VOTING RIGHTS.  
                                             Shoghi 
 
 
2 March 1951 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letters dated June 12th, October 23rd and 
December 14th, 1950, and February 12th and 13th, 1951, 
as well as your latest dated 2.3.51, together with their 
enclosures, have been received, and our beloved Guardian 
has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  The material 
sent under separate cover has also been received.  
     In regard to the various questions you have raised in your 
letters, the Guardian does not feel that we are justified in 
removing a &Baha'i from the voting list just because they 
resign from the Spiritual Assembly.  Although it is 
considered a moral responsibility on the part of the believers 
to serve on Spiritual Assemblies if they are elected, if for 
 
+P166 
some reason, they feel they must resign from that body--in 
other words for some really weighty reason--it certainly 
does not mean that they have lost their &Baha'i voting rights.  
The friends should be encouraged to shoulder the burdens 
of the administrative work--on the other hand, they 
cannot be forced to do so if they have any valid reason to 
support their refusal.  
     The Guardian was pleased to note that the &Baha'is figured 
on the census for the first time.  He hopes that, in the future, 
your Assembly will be able to establish itself legally in such a 
manner as to be the absolute owner and the administrator of 
&Baha'i endowments.  If you already have this status, he 
would like to be informed of it.  
     A &Baha'i can certainly be an Esperantist.  The Guardian 
does not think that in the case you mention, it is right to ask 
this old man to resign from his Masonic Lodge.  Generally 
speaking, the friends should not enter secret societies.  It is 
certainly much better for the believers to dissociate 
themselves from such organizations; but as I said, it would 
seem unnecessary, in this particular case, to ask a very old 
man to break this connection at the end of his life.  
     ...It is most unfortunate that just as the believers in the 
eastern zone were beginning to be more active and able to 
keep in contact with your Assembly and with the &Baha'i in 
other parts of the world, they should now be suddenly 
entirely cut off and their activities banned.  He feels, 
however, that your Assembly has taken the wise decision in 
regard to connection with them.  If, through any personal 
letters, it is possible to assure them of his prayers, he would 
like you to please do so.  
     He is very glad to hear that the National Headquarters is 
now practically finished; and assures your Assembly that he 
approves of your raising a first mortgage on it, provided this 
 
+P167 
is absolutely necessary, and you are sure that you can 
handle the repayment of it in the future.  He would prefer, 
naturally, that this building which is of such importance to 
your national activities, and of which the believers are all so 
proud, should be free of any incumbency.  
     The desire of the German believers to participate in the 
construction of the Holy Tomb of the &Bab touches him very 
much; and he would suggest that, as it is not feasible at 
present for any funds to be sent out of that country, you 
accept contributions for this Fund and spend them at 
present in Germany, until such future time as it will be 
possible to remit the sum to Haifa.  
     &Naw-Ruz and &Ridvan are celebrated all over the &Baha'i 
world according to the solar calendar--there is no 
difference in the dates in the east or the west.  
     In regard to your publishing work:  It is most unfortunate 
that, through the delay in printing "God Passes By", you 
now require such an exorbitant sum to be expended on it, if 
it is gotten out in England.  The Guardian has explained to 
Mr. Hofman that he feels that unless some arrangement can 
be made with your Assembly to get out this book with the 
sum already forwarded by him for this purpose, that it is not 
possible to go on with the publication at this time, as the 
funds of the Cause, limited as they are, must now be 
concentrated on building the upper parts of the Shrine of the 
&Bab.  If there is any way that your Assembly can arrange 
with Mr. Hofman to receive a certain number of copies--
perhaps unbound--at this time, and have them bound in 
Germany, he would approve of this, and suggests you look 
into the matter.  Of course, if there was any way Mr. 
Hofman could transmit to you the money he has received, 
and you could publish the book in Germany, the Guardian 
would approve of this.  
 
+P168 
     He thinks that "Some Answered Questions" is more 
important in the teaching work than "Paris Talks", and 
recommends to get "Some Answered Questions" out first.  
     The Guardian has already written to ..., asking him to 
reconcile himself with your Assembly and to entirely forget 
this episode, which he considers to have been due to a 
misunderstanding, and certainly not worth the amount of 
feeling that was expended upon it on all sides.  He hopes that 
your Assembly will accept any overtures he and his dear 
Father may make, and assist them to put the whole thing 
behind them, and go on with their active service in the 
Cause to which we know they are both so attached at heart.  
     In this connection, the Guardian would like to point out 
to your Assembly that, although it is sometimes necessary to 
take away the voting rights of a believer for purposes of 
discipline, that this prerogative of the National Assembly 
should be used only in extreme cases.  It is very bad for the 
believers to have the feeling that their Assembly will deal too 
harshly with them, and the net result can only be that a 
feeling of fear or alienation or resentment may grow up in 
their hearts towards the body that they should look to as 
being, not only their elected representatives, but their 
helper,--one might almost say their father--and the one 
to whom they can confidently take their problem, and 
whose wishes and decrees they will respect and obey 
unhesitatingly.  
     The Guardian has never heard of any ruling by which a 
believer who does not attend three consecutive 19 Day 
Feasts can be deprived of his voting rights.  He does not 
consider that such action is justifiable at all.  The whole 
question is whether a person considers himself a &Baha'i or 
not, and is willing to adhere to the principles of the Faith 
and accept the authority of the Guardian and the 
 
+P169 
Administration,--whether that individual is able, or 
always in a condition psychologically to attend Feasts and 
&Baha'i meetings is an entirely different subject.  If a person 
makes it quite clear that they do not wish to be considered 
an active member of the &Baha'i Community and be affiliated 
with it and exert their voting right, then their name should 
be removed from the voting list; but if a person considers 
himself or herself a &Baha'i, and for various reasons is not 
able to be active in the affairs of the Community, then they 
should certainly not be removed from our voting list, least 
of all at present, when the number of the &Baha'i Community 
is so small.  
     Our beloved Guardian regrets extremely the delay in 
answering many of these questions.  This has been, and still 
is, an extremely difficult period for him.  He has so much 
work to do--there are so many things to be attended to 
here in Haifa--with the construction of the Shrine and the 
administration of the many &Baha'i properties here, and also 
through the formation of this first International &Baha'i 
Council, that he is finding it extremely difficult to attend to 
his correspondence--even such important letters as those 
he receives from the national bodies.  
     We are all hoping that this is merely a transitional and 
difficult phase, and that soon he will be able to find some 
respite from his heavy duties, and devote more time to 
taking care of his precious health.  If he were not so 
overburdened with details which, alas, are often very 
insignificant, he would be able to give out so much more to 
the believers all over the world.  The friends should pray that 
God will lift some of these burdens from their Guardian, 
and enable them to receive the full bounties of his mind and 
spirit, which he could pour forth into the body of the Faith 
if he were only not so exhausted and preoccupied.  
 
+P170 
     The increased activity of your Assembly, the increased 
unity amongst the believers and their evident sense of 
growing responsibilities, the work already achieved in 
constructing the national &Hazirat--all these things augur 
well for the expansion of our glorious Faith in Germany and 
Austria, and undoubtedly are hastening the day when this 
Community will play a more important role in the 
international affairs of the Faith, and be able to carry out its 
own final duties in neighbouring countries, and thus enrich 
the record of its services to the Cause of God.  
     He assures you, one and all, of his loving prayers for the 
success of your work; and deeply appreciates the spirit of 
dedication which animates your Body....  
 
Post Script (March 8) 
     In regard to the matter you raised in your latest letter, the 
Guardian does not see how, under present circumstances, 
he can arrange to transfer any more funds to Germany.  He 
regrets this very much; but, as you know, nothing can be 
sent out of this country, and the International Fund cannot 
support any additional work on this national headquarters 
at the present time.  He will pray that this obstacle may be 
swiftly removed from your path.  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     The progress achieved in recent months, in both the 
teaching field and the consolidation of national and local 
administrative institutions, by the German &Baha'i 
community is highly exhilarating and has served to deepen 
my feelings of admiration for its members who have so 
faithfully arisen to compensate for the years of enforced 
inactivity resulting from the repressive policy followed 
 
+P171 
during the last world conflict.  The one dark cloud on an 
otherwise bright horizon has been the disabilities suffered 
by their brethren and compatriots in the Eastern zone of 
their divided land and their virtual separation from them at 
a time when their close association and collaboration would 
have greatly reinforced the foundations of their common 
Faith and redounded to its fame and glory.  
     The field now stretching before the believers constituting 
the major part of a sundered community is, however, still so 
vast, its needs so great and its spiritual receptivity so 
pronounced that they cannot afford to either relax for a 
moment in their efforts or hesitate in the prosecution of 
their sacred task.  To publicize the Faith and disseminate its 
literature; to lend an ever-increasing impetus to the 
multiplication and consolidation of its nascent institutions; 
to accelerate the incorporations of firmly established 
assemblies; to overcome by any means in their power the 
obstacles obstructing the completion of their national 
administrative headquarters; to persevere in their efforts to 
guide, encourage and strengthen the community of their 
brethren in Austria; to prosecute with diligence and 
determination the Plan they have initiated; to remove, 
once and for all, every trace of inharmony and of 
misunderstanding which may linger among some of the 
members of the community; to forge fresh links with the 
newly fledged assemblies in the goal countries of the 
European continent and their subsidiary institutions; to 
reinforce the ties binding them in particular, to their sole 
sister national assembly in Europe and other &Baha'i national 
assemblies in general--these may be regarded as the 
outstanding and immediate obligations devolving upon the 
national elected representatives of a community which in 
the concluding period of the Heroic Age of the Faith has 
 
+P172 
been made the recipient of such marked blessings and 
favours from the Center of &Baha'u'llah's Covenant, which 
on the morrow of His ascension played so notable a part in 
preserving the integrity of the Cause of God and in 
establishing the agencies of its rising Administrative Order, 
which demonstrated in the course of the prolonged ordeal it 
subsequently experienced, its tenacity, fidelity and 
exemplary devotion, and which is now preparing itself for 
the gigantic tasks that await to be accomplished by its 
valiant members in so large a section of the European and 
Asiatic continents.  
     The record of service stretching behind them is indeed 
highly inspiring.  The vision of future victories at home and 
in distant fields now unfolding before them is even more 
glorious and highly challenging.  The more they consecrate 
themselves to their present tasks, the more faithfully and 
promptly they fulfil the requirements of the Plan to which 
they stand committed, the sooner will they acquire the 
spiritual potentialities that will empower them to qualify for 
the successful conduct and the ultimate consummation of so 
colossal an enterprise destined to shed so great and 
imperishable a lustre on both their community and nation.  
     That they may be vouchsafed by Providence all the 
strength and guidance they require for the attainment of 
their immediate goal, that they may prove themselves 
worthy of receiving a still greater measure of celestial 
strength and Divine sustenance for the achievement of their 
ultimate objective is the dearest wish of my heart and 
constant prayer.

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Our Guardian was very pleased to see the Post card of the 
new German National &Baha'i Headquarters, and also to 
note the official cancellation mentioning the &Baha'i annual 
Convention.  
     He feels sure the Faith in Germany, through means such 
as these, will attract an ever wider interest in the public at 
large.  
     He wishes all of you every success in your devoted 
services to the Cause of God....  
 
+P174 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty abundantly reward you for your 
labours, guide every step you take in the path of service, and 
aid you to extend continually the range of your accomplishments, 
and contribute effectively to the consolidation of the 
nascent institutions of our beloved Faith, 
                                    Your true brother,

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of July 22 reached our beloved Guardian, and 
he has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.  
     He was very happy to see the friends are now regularly 
enjoying the use of the National Headquarters which they 
constructed through so much effort and sacrifice.  This 
marks a great step forward in the progress of the Faith in 
Germany, and will ever-increasingly lead to bounties and 
blessings.  
     He assures you one and all of his most loving prayers for 
the success of your devoted services to the Cause of God....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty reward you abundantly for your 
steadfast and meritorious labours, aid you to acquire a 
fuller understanding of the essentials of His Faith, and 
contribute effectively to the consolidation of its nascent 
institutions, 
                                    Your true and grateful brother,

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your loving message was received by our beloved 
Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his 
behalf.  
     He was particularly pleased to hear the sessions of the 
School were carried forward in an atmosphere of love and 
harmony, as this is the very essence of &Baha'i living.  
     He urges you all to redouble your teaching efforts in your 
local Communities, and he will pray for you all....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Spirit of &Baha'u'llah sustain and guide you in 
your meritorious activities, bless your high endeavours, and 
enable you to lend a great impetus to the consolidation of 
the institutions of His glorious Faith, 
                                    Your true brother,

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your greeting reached our beloved Guardian, and he was 
very happy to see your school had been so successful and 
well attended.  
     Hamburg is a very important Center, one of the oldest 
&Baha'i Centers in Germany, and situated in a position where 
it can favour the spread of the Faith.  It is, therefore, 
essential for the believers there to be firm and united in 
serving the Cause, for them to keep in close contact with the 
National institutions of the Faith in Germany, and to be 
 
+P176 
active in teaching, and also in associating with travelling 
&Baha'is who pass through their city.  
     He will pray for the success of your &Baha'i work....  
P.S.  He was very interested to see the "Rundbrief" you 
enclosed.  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty bless your high endeavours, guide and 
sustain you in your meritorious activities, and enable you to 
promote the best interests of the institutions of His Faith, 
                                    Your true brother, 
                                               Shoghi 
 
 
30 October 1951 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letters dated May 31, August 14, and two of 
September 16, have been received, as well as other material 
sent the Guardian by you under separate cover, and he has 
instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     Please note that on behalf of the beloved Guardian I have 
written direct to ... assuring her of his prayers and his 
sympathy for her sufferings.  Cancer is a most terrible 
affliction, and has taken its toll of some very fine &Baha'is, 
alas!  
     The Guardian was particularly pleased to hear so many of 
the German friends could be present at the E.T. Conference 
in Holland.  This association of the friends is a great 
stimulus to the work, and he hopes will increase in scale as 
the situation in Europe improves.  
     He was also very glad to know your Assembly met with 
... and ... as Berlin and Vienna are important centers, and 
the work needs to be stimulated and fostered in both places, 
especially Vienna.  
 
+P177 
     The Guardian feels that the financing of the &Hazira--so 
that debts may not pile up too much--and the teaching 
work are very important.  
     To concentrate on achieving the goals of your Plan you 
should, if necessary, make economies in other directions.  In 
America, for years, the publication of "World Order 
Magazine" was given up, as it was not essential, and the 
money in the Fund was more urgently needed elsewhere.  He 
feels that, if necessary, "Sonne der Wahrheit" and the Youth 
Bulletin can be given up.  The Youth can have a place in 
your regular "&Baha'i News" for themselves.  However, these 
are matters for your assembly to weigh and decide upon.  
     The most important thing of all, now that greater unity 
has been established in the German Community, is to make 
the friends pioneerconscious; they must learn to venture 
forth, putting their trust in God, and go to new cities and 
towns to establish the Cause.  This will mark an entirely new 
phase in the history of the Cause in Germany, and will give 
the &Baha'is a sense of victory and importance they have 
never had before.  When they see how, after years of 
persecution, of war, occupation, financial chaos and 
instability, they have built their &Hazira, and moved their 
National Headquarters to it, they must feel both astonished 
at their victory and immensely proud.  Did they ever believe 
such a thing could happen?  Let them, then, with the same 
faith and determination, arise and build up new assemblies 
and groups.  They will find that they succeed as they 
succeeded with their &Hazira.  
     The Guardian remembers you all in his prayers, and is 
very pleased with the progress so far made by the German 
friends.  But he hopes they will now accomplish still greater 
feats!...  
 
+P178 
          [From the Guardian:]
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     The Plan now being prosecuted with such diligence, 
fidelity, unity and enthusiasm by the long oppressed, 
greathearted, indefatigable, much admired German &Baha'i 
community, despite the exhaustion following a prolonged 
ordeal, is entering upon its concluding phase.  This first 
collective enterprise, embarked upon by a community 
which, by virtue of its size, its experience, its past 
achievements, occupies a preeminent position in the 
European continent, and is destined, in view of its capacity, 
its fortitude, its resilience and tenacity of purpose, to play 
an outstanding role in both contemporary and future &Baha'i 
history, must, through a concerted and supreme effort on 
the part of its members, be brought to a triumphant 
conclusion.  
     Its successful termination will be but a signal for a series 
of enterprises, each more glorious than the one preceding it, 
which will carry the fame of this community, already tested 
in the crucible of afflictive trials, and richly endowed by the 
tender favours of its Founder, Who blessed with His 
Presence its leading center, to regions far beyond the 
confines of its homeland and as far as the Eastern fringes of 
the Asiatic continent.  
     In such a glorious venture, and in the course of so vast, so 
momentous and sacred an enterprise, it will, if it discharges 
manfully its present task, be seconded in its noble exertions 
by the concerted efforts of all the budding communities in 
the European continent, and will play a notable role, in 
collaboration with the trustees of &Abdu'l-Baha's Divine 
Plan labouring throughout the American continents, and 
with its sister communities toiling in Africa, South East 
Asia, and Australasia, in achieving the spiritual conquest of 
the entire planet.  
 
+P179 
     Much depends, however, on the manner in which it 
discharges the responsibilities of the present hour.  The 
administrative base from which it must spread out into 
Eastern and Southern Europe, and beyond these spheres 
into the heart of Northern Asia, as far as the China Sea, 
must first be thoroughly consolidated.  The valiant 
battalions that are to carry the banner of the Faith of 
&Baha'u'llah to distant climes, amidst alien races, and 
throughout the length and breadth of immense territories 
and in inhospitable surroundings, must, to begin with, 
increase in number, acquire added experience, and deepen 
in their faith and understanding.  The literature with which 
the bearers of God's redeeming Message must be equipped 
when launching out beyond the frontiers of their native land 
must, preparatory to their arduous crusade, be multiplied 
and adapted to the mentality of those diversified peoples 
and races inhabiting so vast a section of the globe.  
     The &Baha'i Administrative headquarters now being 
completed in the heart and center of this community's 
homeland must be speedily consolidated and further 
extended.  The assemblies and groups which, as a result of 
the operation of the present Plan, must be brought into 
being, must be safeguarded and strengthened.  The spiritual 
life of its participating members must, while this process of 
administrative consolidation is being accelerated, be 
continually enriched, their vision broadened, their 
understanding deepened, their unity reinforced, their 
enthusiasm enkindled through the institutions of summer-schools, 
conventions, regional conferences, youth rallies 
and study classes.  The unity and solidarity of the members 
of this community must be vigilantly safeguarded and 
constantly reinforced.  The ties binding it to its neighbouring 
sister-community in Austria must be greatly strengthened, 
 
+P180 
and the administrative agencies operating in both 
communities must be closely correlated and the cooperation 
between them continually fostered.  
     Then and only then, will this community be empowered 
to launch befittingly its first campaign across the borders of 
its native land, and manifest, as it projects itself beyond its 
national frontiers and diffuses over regions, both far and 
near, the illuminating radiance of &Baha'u'llah's redemptive 
Revelation, the potencies with which its Divine Founder, 
the Center of the Covenant, endowed it in the course of the 
last decade of His Ministry.  
     As the centenary of the birth of &Baha'u'llah's Mission 
approaches, as the Plan formulated by this Community 
draws to a close, a supreme effort, unprecedented in its 
scope and intensity, must be exerted collectively by its 
members, young and old, an effort that will arouse the 
admiration of the entire world, that will proclaim its 
worthiness and capacity to shoulder so immense a task in 
the future, and which will carry to a triumphant conclusion 
this initial undertaking, embarked upon by the German and 
Austrian followers of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah in the heart of 
the European continent.

30 May 1952 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother:  
     The beloved Guardian has received your letters of 
January 29, February 13, April 7 and April 14 (2), and May 
1, 1952, and he has instructed me to answer you on his 
behalf.  
     He was very pleased to hear of the progress the German 
&Baha'is are making, not only in their teaching work, as 
witnessed by the formation of new assemblies and the 
establishment of new groups, but also in the administrative 
field.  
     The reports he received about the success of your 
Convention this year, the free consultation and the unity 
which prevailed amongst the friends, encouraged him 
greatly.  He feels that this indicates a new maturity on the 
part of the German believers.  They must come to realize 
that the Administration is a system both living and dynamic, 
and that, through obedience to its principles and 
regulations, they will gain greater strength in teaching the 
Faith, and be able to direct their energies as a united force 
into the different channels of service that lie open to them.  
 
+P182 
One of the main reasons why the Faith does not advance 
more rapidly is because the friends have not learned to live 
with, and work within the framework of the Administrative 
Order.  Either they crystallize it into too set a form, or they 
rebel against what they feel to be a System, and do not give 
it sufficient support.  Both of these extremes impede the 
progress of the Faith, and the efficiency of the believers.  
     In this connection I should like to mention that the 
Guardian states that the Hands of the Cause are eligible to 
administrative offices except those permanently residing in 
Haifa and helping the Guardian in the administrative work.  
Whenever the time comes when the Hands should give up 
their administrative offices in order to be more free to serve 
under his direction, he will inform the friends.  
     The convention--all &Baha'i Conventions--must be held 
within the &Ridvan period; and he was very pleased to see 
that you had been able to advance the date of your 
Convention without affecting its success.  
     As regards the question you asked, the &Baha'i marriage 
certificate has been accepted by the Israel Authorities.  All 
the &Baha'i properties and imports are exempt from taxation 
and customs, and the status of the Faith as a religion, 
recognized.  At present, we are planning to clarify our legal 
position with the Government, and get it on a more concrete 
footing.  We are not incorporated here, but there are the 
Palestine Branches of the National Spiritual Assemblies of 
both the United States and India incorporated here, and 
holding title to property.  
     He was very pleased to see that the Secretary is now 
residing at the &Hazira, as he considers this both the proper 
procedure, and important for the national work.  
     He was very sorry to learn that you are still having so 
many financial difficulties in connection with the 
 
+P183 
Headquarters, and hopes that, through the self-sacrifice of 
the believers, the debts can be gradually wiped out, and 
funds be made available for other important forms of &Baha'i 
activity.  
     He thanks you all for the expression of your loving 
sympathy on the occasion of the passing of dear Mr. 
Maxwell.  His services will long be remembered, and he has 
had a very great bounty in being permitted to design the 
Holy Tomb of the &Bab.  
     He assures you all that, in his visits to the Holy Shrines, 
he remembers you lovingly in his prayers, and supplicates 
for your guidance and the advancement of your work....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     From the reports and communications received, in the 
course of recent months, from your assembly I have derived 
considerable satisfaction, as I have noted the spirit of wholehearted 
dedication which has animated its members in the 
discharge of the manifold duties and sacred responsibilities 
which have faced them in the execution of their Plan.  It is 
indeed highly gratifying, and a source of great pride, to 
contemplate the progress that has been made, the 
consolidation that has been achieved, the great sacrifices 
that have been willingly undertaken, the enthusiasm, the 
fidelity, and the perseverance that have been so abundantly 
demonstrated, the publicity that has been accorded the 
Faith, the plans that have been devised, the marked stimulus 
that has been given to the activities of the Youth, the 
harmony that has characterized the collaboration of the 
oriental and occidental believers, the progress made in 
connexion with the National &Haziratu'l-Quds, the steady 
expansion of Publishing activities, and above all, the 
notable improvement in the spiritual life of the community, 
 
+P184 
as witnessed by the greater unity, cooperation and 
understanding prevailing among its members.  
     As the last year of the Plan, formulated by the German 
&Baha'i community inexorably draws to its close, a 
concerted, a redoubled effort should be made to ensure that 
all its provisions, without any exception, will be fully 
carried out, that the members of this community may thus 
acquire the spiritual potentiality regarded as indispensable 
for the launching of a still greater enterprise, on the morrow 
of the celebrations of the approaching &Baha'i Holy year--
an enterprise that will bring the much-admired, greatly 
loved, highly promising community of the followers of the 
Faith of &Baha'u'llah, in both Germany and Austria, into 
direct association with its sister communities throughout the 
&Baha'i world for the conduct of the world Crusade destined 
to immortalize the decade separating the two greatest 
Jubilees of the second &Baha'i century.  
     Whilst every ounce of energy will be exerted for the 
consummation of their present task, special attention 
should be directed towards the consolidation of the ties, 
both spiritual and administrative, that must continue to bind 
the believers in the Western Zone of Germany to their 
brethren in the Eastern Zone, as well as to those living in the 
Republic of Austria.  A special effort must, moreover, be 
exerted to improve and consolidate the relationship existing 
between the German &Baha'i community and the civil 
authorities, both local and central, in order to give greater 
publicity to the Faith, and facilitate the expansion of its 
administrative institutions in the crucial years ahead.  No 
less energetic efforts must be made to stimulate the process 
of the incorporation of the local assemblies, and to obtain a 
better legal status for the German &Baha'i National 
Assembly, raising thereby the status of the Faith and 
 
+P185 
consolidating the foundations of its highest administrative 
agency in the heart of the European continent.  
     The total success of the Plan, now demanding the 
concentrated attention of the entire German &Baha'i 
community, is indeed indispensable for the adequate 
discharge of the still greater tasks that lie ahead of its 
members, and which, in themselves, will constitute the 
prelude to the unfoldment of the glorious Mission awaiting 
them, as soon as the present obstacles are removed, in both 
Eastern Europe and the heart of the Asiatic continent.  The 
extent of their future undertakings in both continents; their 
contribution to the Global Crusade to be launched 
throughout the whole planet; their particular and, in many 
ways, unique, reinforcement of the work, connected with 
future &Baha'i research and scholarship, in view of the 
characteristic qualities of painstaking thoroughness, 
scientific exactitude and dispassionate criticism distinguishing 
the race to which they belong,--these are too vast and 
complex to be assessed at the present time.  
     They, no doubt, stand, emerging as they have done, from 
two successive world ordeals that have served to purify, 
vitalize, and weld them together, on the threshold of an era 
of glorious achievements, both at home and abroad.  Their 
present Plan is but the initial chapter in the history of their 
collective achievements in the service of the Faith of 
&Baha'u'llah--a service, anticipated in such glowing terms, 
by the One, through Whose creative power, this community 
was brought into being, Who nursed it in its infancy, and 
Who, through His personal visit communicated to it, in a 
direct and effective manner, the impulse destined to sustain 
its growth, guide its steps and lead it to ultimate victory.  
     The participation of the &Baha'i community, in both 
Germany and Austria, individually as well as officially, in the 
 
+P186 
forthcoming Stockholm inter-continental Conference, to 
which I trust its members will contribute a notable share, in 
view of the part they are destined to play in the future 
awakening of the European Continent--will no doubt, 
launch them upon the initial stage of their glorious Mission 
beyond the confines of their respective countries.  Theirs will 
be the two-fold and highly challenging task of 
consolidating, steadily and rapidly, the administrative 
foundations of the Structure which is being painstakingly 
established by them in the heart of the European continent, 
and of implanting the banner of the rising order of their 
Faith in the neighbouring sovereign states and dependencies 
of that continent and even beyond its borders, as far as the 
heart of Asia.  
     Time is running out.  The work they have to accomplish is 
immense, exacting, thrilling and inescapable.  The hosts of 
the Concourse on high will surely lead them onward and 
assure them a resounding victory, if they but keep their 
vision undimmed, if they refuse to faint or falter, if they 
persevere and remain faithful to both the spiritual and the 
administrative principles inculcated by their Faith.  
     That they may discharge nobly their trust, that they may 
emerge triumphant from the first stage of their collective 
and historic undertaking, that they may set an undying 
example to their brethren in East and West, of &Baha'i 
solidarity, of tenacity of purpose, of single-minded 
devotion, of unrelaxing vigilance, of assiduous labour, of 
harmonious cooperation, of audacity, and of absolute 
dedication to the aims and purposes of their Faith, is the 
object of my special, my loving and constant prayers at the 
threshold of the Shrine of &Baha'u'llah.  
                                    Your true brother,

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has instructed me to write you on 
his behalf, to request that the information relating to 
Germany and Austria and their activities, contained in the 
booklet "The &Baha'i Faith", `Information Statistical and 
Comparative', be brought up to date as of May 1, 1952, 
and sent to him here by the first possible air mail post.  
     One of the features of the Holy Year will be the re-issuance 
of this important book; inasmuch as the Holy Year is fast 
approaching, the Guardian wishes information as quickly as 
possible.  
     Briefly, the information which your NSA is to provide, 
brought up to date of May 1, 1952, is as follows:  
 
     Incorporated Local Spiritual Assemblies in Germany 
     and Austria, showing each country with its Local 
     Assemblies separate.  
 
     &Baha'i Centers in Germany and Austria, showing if 
     possible the division between Local Spiritual 
     Assemblies, Groups and Isolated Believers.  
 
     Any information not immediately available, should be 
handled by telegraph, but such information as is available 
should not be delayed for any one or two delinquents.  You 
can appreciate that if the booklet is to be published early in 
the Holy Year, the information should reach the Guardian 
at a very early date.

Dear &Baha'i Brother:  
     Owing to the fact that telegrams and cables going out 
from here are frequently garbled in transmission and the 
meaning is not clear, I am mailing to you at the instruction 
 
+P191 
of our beloved Guardian, his Message to the German &Baha'i 
Convention.  
     Please cable him immediately this Message reaches your 
hands, so that he will know that you have received it in time 
for the Convention.  It is really a cable which is being mailed 
to you, in order to prevent errors.  
     The Guardian hopes the German and Austrian friends 
will have a wonderful Convention this year, as preparation 
for the great work that lies ahead of them, and assures your 
Body of his prayers for the success of the Convention and 
the manifold activities of the German believers....

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has been greatly encouraged by the 
reports which he has received of the teaching activities 
throughout the world.  
     Notwithstanding we have just published the statistical 
book, giving the number of localities throughout the world 
where &Baha'is reside, yet the Guardian would like to have 
accurate information now, based on the results of the 
elections on April 21, 1953.  
     Will you therefore please send to me just as quickly as 
possible, a statement showing the localities in your country 
and Austria where &Baha'is reside, and in each instance, 
indicate whether it is an Assembly, a Group or isolated 
believers....  
 
 
10 June 1953 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Our Beloved Guardian has been greatly encouraged by 
reports reaching him from all parts of the &Baha'i World; of 
the victories already gained, and the plans being laid for the 
prosecution of the Ten Year Crusade.  
     They have evoked his awe-inspiring, and soul-stirring 
cablegram of May 28th, calling for the immediate 
settlement of all the 131 virgin areas of the Plan, just as 
quickly as possible.  He is convinced, that the Friends will 
arise and translate their enthusiasm into Action, because the 
Keynote of the Crusade must be Action, Action, Action.  
     The Beloved Guardian has directed me to write your 
Assembly to amplify some of the aspects of his dynamic 
message.  
 
+P194 
     The settlement of these virgin areas is of such an 
emergency nature, that he feels pioneering in one of them 
takes precedence over every other type of &Baha'i service--
whether it be in the teaching or administrative fields of the 
Faith.  
     In America some 150 people have volunteered for pioneer 
service, and some of them already are preparing to leave for 
their posts.  The Guardian has informed the American 
National Assembly, that because of their being the Chief 
Executor of the Divine Plan of &Abdu'l-Baha for teaching 
throughout the world, their pioneers may be sent to any 
virgin area in the world, regardless to which NSA it may be 
assigned.  If any of their pioneers wish to pioneer in any of 
the areas assigned to your Assembly, they will communicate 
with you.  
     There are some general observations which the Guardian 
shares with you, and then some specific suggestions which 
are enumerated below.  
 
1.  Every individual who offers to pioneer, should be 
encouraged and assisted in every way possible by the 
National Assembly.  
 
2.  Every application for pioneering must be expedited, and 
not allowed to drag in any way, either in the handling by the 
NSA or any Committee working out the details for the 
NSA.  
 
3.  The National Assembly must make the settlement of their 
virgin areas, the first order of their business.  In other words 
nothing is more important at this time, than settlement of 
the 131 virgin areas.  
 
4.  More than two pioneers should not be sent to any one 
place; except of course, unless they are members of one 
family.  In fact, what is wanted is to settle each area with 
&Baha'is, and therefore, 1 &Baha'i will fulfill the initial task.  
 
+P195 
     The specific suggestions which the Guardian makes, are:  
 
A1.  Areas close at hand easy of settlement should be filled 
first.  Then the areas more difficult, and finally, those which 
will be difficult.  
 
B2.  Whenever a pioneer enters a new territory, a cable 
should be sent at once to the Beloved Guardian, giving the 
name, place, and any pertinent information.  
 
C3.  A report should be sent each month by your Assembly 
to the Secretary-General of the International &Baha'i Council, 
giving the progress of your teaching work in new areas of 
the Plan, particularly the virgin areas assigned to your NSA.  
This does not mean your assembly should correspond with 
the International Council concerning administrative matters 
in connection with the Plan, but that only reports of 
progress should be sent them.  Administrative matters, etc., 
should be handled by your Assembly directly with the 
Guardian.  
 
D4.  The Guardian feels the following areas should be easily 
settled, and he would appreciate your arranging to send 
pioneers there at the earliest possible date:  
 
     Frisian Islands.  
     Greece--(this is very important, because it is the last 
          national community in Europe without &Baha'is).  
     Crete.  
 
     After these are settled, others more difficult should be 
considered.  
     The beloved Guardian wishes the German &Baha'is, 
likewise to assist more actively in the spread of the Faith in 
Austria.  There should be additional &Baha'i Centers in 
Austria, and he hopes the German &Baha'is will be most 
helpful in accomplishing this.  
     The &Baha'is of Germany and Austria have a very great 
responsibility in connection with the development of the 
 
+P196 
Ten Year Crusade.  &Abdu'l-Baha himself visited your 
countries.  He spoke often and lovingly of the German 
Friends.  Their countries are the heart of Europe, and the 
heart must be strong and vigorous.  Now then, is the time 
for the Believers to achieve the blessings the Master 
promised them, by "scattering", and continuously settling 
new areas.  The Guardian will await with keen anticipation 
reports of your activities in the all important teaching field.  
     As his dramatic cable indicates, the Guardian will have 
prepared, an illuminated "Roll of Honor", on which will be 
inscribed the names of the "Knights of &Baha'u'llah", who 
first enter these 131 virgin areas.  This "Roll of Honor" will 
be placed inside the entrance door of the Inner Sanctuary of 
the Tomb of &Baha'u'llah.  
     From time to time, the Guardian will announce to the 
&Baha'i World, the names of those Holy Souls who arise 
under the conditions outlined in his message, and settle 
these areas, and conquer them for the Cause of God.  
     Now is the time for the &Baha'is of the World to 
demonstrate the spiritual vitality of the Faith, and to arise as 
one soul to spread the Glory of the Lord, over the face of the 
Earth.  The Guardian is sure, that the &Baha'is of Germany 
and Austria who have served and sacrificed so long for the 
Faith, will continue their glorious record by winning many 
new victories for the Glory of the Lord.  
     The Guardian will pray fervently for the &Baha'is of 
Germany and Austria, and for the success of their efforts.  
     He will pray for the members of the Assembly, whose 
sacrificial efforts he will cherish for all time....  
 
+P197 
21 June 1953 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother:  
     Your letters of June 18 and 24, July 29, August 11, 
October 9, November 27, 1952 and January 5, February 
26, March 12 and 18, April 5, May 6 and 31, 1953 have 
been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has 
instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     The work has been greatly added to, here at the 
International Center, owing to the inauguration of the Ten 
Year Crusade.  In fact, the beloved Guardian is finding it 
more and more difficult to keep up with his letters, even the 
important National Spiritual Assembly ones.  
     In regard to various matters you have raised in your 
correspondence with him:  
     The National &Baha'i Convention must be held during the 
twelve days constituting the &Ridvan period.  Each national 
assembly is free to choose the dates that suit its convenience 
during that period.  
     The question of adhering strictly to the principle that 
every Spiritual Assembly must be composed of voting 
members living within the civic limits of the town, and that 
the &Baha'i Community of that town must likewise be 
composed of residents within its civic limits, is of the utmost 
importance.  It is a matter of fundamental principle, and the 
&Baha'is all over the world must conform to it, especially 
now that the Cause is becoming firmly established in so 
many nations.  There is no objection if the believers living in 
a certain area comprising a number of civic units, join 
together to commemorate &Baha'i Holy Days, but Nineteen 
Day Feasts should be held apart by each Assembly in 
question.  There can be no exceptions to these rules, and 
although it may temporarily diminish the number of 
 
+P198 
assemblies in your country, you should establish the Cause 
on this firm foundation by next &Baha'i election.  
     Please send the Guardian ten copies of the "Paris Talks" 
and ten copies of "Some Answered Questions" for the 
international libraries here, and ten copies of any future 
publication in German.  
     He was very happy to hear that the visit of the Hands and 
of other &Baha'is traveling in Europe, was of such 
stimulation to the friends.  
     He hopes that as many of the German believers as 
possible will attend the Stockholm Conference, which is 
very important for the future work in Europe, and to which 
they can contribute a great deal by their presence....  
     As regards the purchase of the land for the future Temple:  
He thinks it does not need to be in the heart of the city; it 
could be in the suburbs and an area of ten thousand square 
metres would be sufficient, less if necessary.  The Chicago 
Temple only seats 1200 people so it is not a very large 
building.  Your Temple could be smaller and competitive 
designs be submitted.  But the first step is to investigate the 
sites available and inform the Guardian.  
     The step to which he attaches at present the greatest 
importance is the dispatch of pioneers under the auspices of 
your Assembly to the virgin territories alloted to the 
German and Austrian &Baha'is under the Ten-Year Plan.  
Naturally, at present it is out of the question to think of 
sending anyone into the Soviet-dominated countries.  But 
every effort should be made to get someone off to Greece, a 
very important country and far too long neglected.  This 
Holy Year should witness, or at least this calendar year, the 
filling of all goal posts which are not behind the Iron 
Curtain.  He hopes that some one of the friends will be able 
to find a position in Greece, or to be sent there by you.  
 
+P199 
     Likewise of great importance is the multiplication of 
centers on the home front, particularly in Austria where 
such slow progress has been made.  If Austria is to have an 
independent National Assembly the work in that country 
must be greatly accelerated in order to provide sufficient 
local assemblies to serve as a firm foundation for the 
National Assembly.  He hopes that members of the German 
community will visit and teach there, and use be made of 
any friends from other countries who may be able to work 
there under the guidance of your assembly.  
     His loving thoughts and prayers are with you always, you 
may be sure....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     The expansion and consolidation of the institutions of the 
Faith of &Baha'u'llah, as a result of the operation of the Plan 
initiated by your Assembly, on the morrow of one of the 
severest ordeals which has ever afflicted the German &Baha'i 
Community, marks a chapter of the highest importance in 
the annals of the Faith in both Germany and Austria and 
will be regarded by posterity as a milestone of historic 
significance in the evolution of the Faith on the European 
Continent.  I greatly value the exertions of both the German 
and Austrian &Baha'i Communities which have, in recent 
years contributed so decisively to the rise and establishment 
of the &Baha'i Administrative Order in the heart of that 
Continent, which is destined to play a notable part in the 
prosecution of the world spiritual Crusade recently 
launched under such auspicious circumstances by the 
followers of &Baha'u'llah in both the Eastern and Western 
Hemispheres.  
     The German and Austrian &Baha'i Communities, on 
whom &Abdu'l-Baha lavished His favours, for whose future 
 
+P200 
He cherished such high hopes, occupying such a central 
position in a continent endowed with such great 
potentialities, must by reason of their unique, and 
predominant position, their past history, their virility, 
tenacity and splendid accomplishments, assume a 
preponderating role in the conduct of a Crusade in which all 
&Baha'i communities dwelling on the European mainland, 
both young and old, are called upon to participate to the 
utmost of their capacity and with all the resources at their 
disposal.  
     They stand, moreover, at this crucial hour in their 
destiny, on the threshold of a new era in their history--the 
era that must witness the initiation of their mission beyond 
the borders of their homeland, and one which must 
culminate in their carrying the banner of the Faith of 
&Baha'u'llah across the eastern frontiers of Europe, and as far 
as the territories lying in the heart of the Asiatic continent.  
     Their task is a twofold one.  On the one hand, they must 
strive to consolidate, by every means in their power, the 
work already accomplished in their homelands; on the other 
they must initiate the meritorious task of opening the virgin 
territories and islands allocated to them in pursuance of the 
provisions of the Ten-Year Plan committed to their charge.  
     On the homefront the most vital, the most strenuous and 
glorious task confronting them--a task that will have far-reaching 
repercussions on not only the fortunes of the Faith 
in their homeland but on the whole continent as well, and is 
bound to exercise a far-reaching influence on the destinies of 
the Faith throughout the world--is the initiation of prompt 
and effective measures for the selection and purchase of the 
site of the first &Mashriqu'l-Adhkar in Europe to be followed 
by the adoption of a suitable design and the necessary steps 
for its execution.  
 
+P201 
     This enterprise is admittedly colossal, taking into 
consideration the circumscribed resources of the two 
communities and their limited membership.  It will, 
however, as soon as it is set in motion, through the initiative 
and efforts of your assembly, receive, in view of its cardinal 
importance and world-wide significance, a substantial 
measure of assistance from the world centre of the Faith and 
the various National Assemblies throughout the &Baha'i 
world.  
     As soon as the site of the projected House of Worship is 
selected, either within or in the immediate vicinity of the 
City of Frankfurt, which, owing to the establishment of the 
&Haziratu'l-Quds within its confines, has come to be 
regarded as the national &Baha'i Administrative Headquarters 
of your Assembly,--an area that need not, for 
the present, exceed one or two acres--steps will be taken 
by myself as well as by your sister-Assemblies in both 
Hemispheres to aid you in this historic fate-laden enterprise 
which will enable the continent of Europe, the third in the 
&Baha'i world, to boast of having raised in its very heart, its 
own &Baha'i House of Worship and which will, God willing, 
through its termination, at the appointed hour, contribute 
an outstanding share to the projected festivities which are to 
commemorate the centenary of the Declaration of the 
Mission of the Founder of our Faith.  
     Second in importance and no less urgent a task is the 
opening, ere the close of the current year, of the three virgin 
territories assigned to your Assembly, through the despatch 
of at least one pioneer...  
     While these primary and urgent tasks are being diligently 
prosecuted, the utmost effort should be exerted to stimulate 
the all-important process of multiplying and consolidating 
the newly-established assemblies, groups and isolated 
 
+P202 
centres in both Germany and Austria as the essential 
pre-requisite to the early formation of independent National 
Assemblies in both countries occupying so central a position 
in the European continent, and destined to play so vital a 
part in the promotion of the interests of the Faith in the 
heart and in the eastern as well as the southern regions of 
that continent.  
     The responsibilities devolving upon these two communities, 
in the course of the coming ten years are enormous, 
pressing, sacred and inescapable.  The Plan committed to 
their care will inaugurate a new and glorious stage in the 
unfoldment of their historic Mission--a stage that will 
enable them to carry, for the first time in their history and in 
a systematic manner, the banner of &Baha'u'llah beyond the 
confines of their homelands.  
     Every sacrifice should be made, and all agencies, local, 
regional and national, must energetically, whole-heartedly, 
and steadfastly participate, to ensure a worthy inauguration 
and an efficient prosecution of the Ten-Year Plan, on which 
the immediate fortunes of these communities must 
necessarily depend.  All without distinction of age, sex or 
calling should arise and lend, to the utmost of their 
capacity, an impetus to the progress of this tremendously 
important and dynamic process now operating in the heart 
of Europe, and whose possibilities can only be dimly 
imagined at present.  
     The hour is propitious for the members of your 
Assembly, reinforced by the continual, the whole-hearted 
and strenuous exertions of the entire body of the German 
and Austrian believers, to distinguish themselves in their 
ceaseless efforts to attain the objectives of their Ten-Year 
Plan, by deeds of such valour as will eclipse the feats 
achieved by them in the past.  
 
+P203 
     Cognizant of the splendid qualities that have 
characterized their stewardship to the Faith of &Baha'u'llah, 
fully aware of the services, they have rendered, in both the 
teaching and administrative spheres of &Baha'i activity, 
despite the severe and prolonged tests and trials which they 
have experienced, I feel confident that these communities, 
so valiant, so richly endowed, so tenacious in their faith and 
sterling in their character, will, at this challenging hour 
grasp this priceless opportunity for the display of still 
greater heroism and of a still more compelling love and 
devotion to the Cause they love so dearly, to which they 
have been so unwaveringly faithful and which they have 
served so long and so well.

4 August 1953 
 
Dear &Baha'i Co-workers:  
     The beloved Guardian has been greatly delighted with the 
reports he has received from all over the &Baha'i world of the 
pioneers who have volunteered for service in the virgin 
areas.  It indicates a very enthusiastic attitude on the part of 
all of the &Baha'is toward the Ten-Year Crusade; and he feels 
sure that if this spirit continues, it will assure us of winning 
all of the goals set for the Crusade.  
     The Guardian asks that you send me by air mail, or by 
cable if possible, the number of pioneer offers which your 
Assembly has received, the number which have been settled, 
and the number which you are actively handling for 
settlement.  
     The beloved Guardian sends his loving greetings to all the 
members of your Assembly.  He greatly values your devotion 
and sacrificial services in the Cause of God....  
 
+P204 
17 August 1953 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has instructed me to write you on 
his behalf concerning a gift which has been made by one of 
the very dear believers in Persia, Mr. ... for the international 
activities of the Faith.  
     The Guardian has decided that at present he feels the best 
use for half of this fund is to ask Mr. ... to give it to the 
National Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is of Germany and 
Austria, to be used for the building of the Temple in 
Frankfurt.  He has written Mr. ... to this effect; therefore in 
due course you should receive 50000 tumans, or its 
equivalent in German marks.  
     When this gift is received from this devoted believer, the 
beloved Guardian would like you to write an appropriate 
letter of appreciation for the very generous gift; sending the 
letter of appreciation to the Guardian, so that he can see 
that it reaches Mr. ... safely.  
     The beloved Guardian sends his loving greetings to each 
and every one of you....  
 
 
12 September 1953 (Youth Summer Session) 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has received the letter which you 
have sent him, and has instructed me to answer you on his 
behalf.  
     Now that the World Crusade has been launched, and is 
very actively operating, as you have no doubt been informed 
by those believers who were privileged to attend the third 
Intercontinental Teaching Conference recently held in 
 
+P205 
Stockholm, the Guardian is confident that you are fully 
conscious of the tremendous responsibilities placed on the 
shoulders of the German and Austrian Communities during 
the opening phase of this Ten-Year Crusade; and that you 
are, one and all, arising to fulfill those tasks in a befitting 
manner.  
     He will pray for you....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty bless, guide and sustain you in your 
devoted endeavours, and enable you to win great victories 
in the service of His Faith, 
                                    Your true brother, 
                                               Shoghi 
 
 
26 September 1953 (Summer School) 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has received the loving letter you 
sent him, which was signed by all those who attended the 
Summer School this year; and has instructed me to answer 
you on his behalf.  
     He was very happy to learn of the inspiration and the 
spiritual impulse given to that gathering by those revered 
Hands of the Cause of God from different countries who 
were there on that occasion.  
     Now that you are all familiar with the goals the Guardian 
has set before the believers in the German and Austrian 
Communities, and particularly those requiring consideration 
first, he is confident that you will arise with one 
accord to accomplish these tasks in a befitting manner.  
     His loving prayers will surround you, as you proceed with 
your historic labours....  
 
+P206 
P.S.--The Guardian appreciates the copy of the Program 
and the publicity which you enclosed.  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty sustain and guide you in your highly 
valued activities, enable you to extend the range of your 
services, and win great and memorable victories in the days 
to come, 
                                    Your true brother, 
                                               Shoghi 
 
 
15 October 1953 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     It is impossible for me to convey to you the great 
happiness of the Guardian over the results achieved since 
the auspicious opening of the Ten-Year Crusade.  
     The Guardian's final cable to the Conference in New 
Delhi shared with the friends the information that fifty of 
the virgin areas have been settled as of October 14th, and 
fifty-four more have been assigned to pioneers.  
     The Guardian is urging every National Spiritual 
Assembly to get out its pledged pioneers to the still unsettled 
virgin areas as fast as possible.  
     I attach hereto copy of a letter which has been sent to all 
pioneers, asking for their complete names, and if possible a 
permanent address.  Will you please arrange for this 
information to be sent to me as additional pioneers go into 
the field?  What the Guardian wants is the complete name of 
each pioneer with accurate spelling.  
     The Guardian sends you all his loving greetings, and 
assures you of his prayers for the success of your arduous 
labours....  
 
+P207 
26 November 1953 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friend:  
     Your loving letter of November 9th reached me on my 
return from a short visit in Switzerland and France.  
     I did have the pleasure of meeting the Lehnes in Zurich, 
and was more than delighted to have this contact with two 
of the sincere and self-sacrificing German &Baha'is, who are 
now winning so many victories for the Faith.  
     I spoke to our beloved Guardian with regard to the 
Frisian Islands.  He said that regardless of the fact that a 
number of the islands are Dutch and others German, that 
the administrative work in all the Frisian Islands should be 
under the German N.S.A., as assigned in the outline of the 
Ten-Year Crusade.  The Guardian stated that he had 
likewise informed the American N.S.A. to this effect.  
     The beloved Guardian is very happy over the reports that 
are being received of the progress of the Ten-Year Crusade.  
All but one of the countries, outside of the iron curtain, 
have now been settled or assigned to pioneers.  The total 
number of areas which have been settled under the Ten-Year 
Crusade, during this period of a little over 6 months 
since its launching, now totals 71.  It is surely remarkable, 
and one of the great victories of the Faith.  
     The Guardian sends his loving greetings to you.  He prays 
for your guidance and confirmation....  
 
 
14 February 1954 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother:  
     Your comprehensive letter of February 5th, replacing 
your letter of February 3rd; also your letter of February 7th, 
 
+P208 
dealing with the question of site for the &Baha'i Temple in 
Frankfurt, has been received by the beloved Guardian, and 
he has asked me to acknowledge them on his behalf.  
     The Guardian was very much impressed with the clear 
and concise outline of the investigations which you have 
made, giving him the best possible opportunity to 
understand the situation fully.  
     The beloved Guardian feels that site "C", Steinbacher-Hohe, 
appears to be the most suitable for the &Baha'i Temple 
and future developments.  He feels therefore that your 
Assembly should immediately arrange for the prompt 
purchase of some of the land.  
     While it would be desirable of course to buy an extensive 
piece of property, the finances of the German National 
Assembly, and the financial obligations all over the &Baha'i 
world, make it impossible to buy a large piece at this time; 
and therefore he feels you should purchase approximately 
10,000 square meters, which it is his understanding would 
cost approximately $10,000.  Should there be available 
more than the $8,000. in the bank to your Assembly, the 
Guardian would see no serious objection to purchasing a 
little additional land, so that the entire expense would not 
be over $12,000.  
     It is noted in your communication you state you have 
$8,000. in the bank in Zurich; but that pledges made at 
Stockholm bring the total amount up to about $12,000.  At 
the Guardian's direction, I am endeavoring to correlate all 
contributions and funds, so we may know the total amount 
available.  
     In order to help clarify this matter, will you please send 
me a statement of the funds which are available in Zurich, 
and in Germany, if any, giving a list of the contributions 
which have been received.  If there have been a number of 
 
+P209 
small contributions, the Guardian does not require that 
information, but simply information as to how much money 
was contributed at Stockholm, for instance, how much has 
been received from large donors, how much from the 
friends in Germany itself, etc.  
     At the same time, I am writing out to other areas, to see if 
any money is being held for the account of your Assembly 
for the purchase of land, in any other areas.  
     The important thing now is to procure the land.  The 
Guardian states it is not necessary for you to refer back to 
him any specific details regarding the land; inasmuch as it 
has now been decided to purchase land in Steinbacher-Hohe.  
He leaves it to your Assembly to pick out the best 
piece of land in the area for the Temple itself.  Later on, 
when financial conditions in Germany, and in the Faith 
generally, are better, consideration can be given to 
additional land for Temple accessories, etc.  
     The Guardian states it is satisfactory to secure designs etc. 
from architects, both &Baha'i and &non-Baha'i, from Germany 
and also from other countries.  In other words, you are free 
to handle this matter actively, submitting designs to the 
Guardian as they are received by you.  The Guardian of 
course wishes the &Baha'i architects to have an opportunity 
to submit their views concerning this sacred edifice.  
     In connection with your question of how you should 
proceed, if it is suitable to ask for designs by architects 
outside of Germany; this of course is left for you to handle 
in your own way.  Of course it is suitable for you to 
correspond with the Spiritual Assemblies in the countries 
involved, asking them to be of assistance in this important 
matter.  
     The Guardian is very hopeful that you may be able to 
conclude the purchase of the land, by the middle of April.  It 
 
+P210 
will be a great victory for the Faith, if it can be accomplished 
within the first year of the Ten-Year Crusade.  
     The Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf, 
that every obstacle may be removed from your path, and 
your actions be both guided and confirmed....  
 
P.S.  In your letter of February 3rd; the maps attached; and 
your letter of February 7th, you refer to Steinbacher Hohe 
as No. C. while in your letter of February 5th, you refer to it 
as No. B.  So that all documents may have the same 
reference, I have changed your letter of February 5th, to 
show Steinbacher Hohe, as No. C.; and Forsthausstrasse as 
No. B.  
 
 
3 April 1954 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian is very anxious to have full 
information concerning the pioneers in the virgin areas of 
the Ten-Year Crusade.  In order to complete the records 
which I have been compiling for him, can you give me the 
following information:  
     Frisian Islands:  Please let me have the address of Miss 
Gertrude Ankersmidt, in the Frisian Isles....  
 
 
17 April 1954 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     At the instruction of our beloved Guardian, I am 
forwarding you herewith his Convention Message.  He 
wishes you to have it read aloud to the assembled delegates, 
and then published and circulated among the believers....  
 
+P211 
21 April 1954 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     I am forwarding you herewith a copy of the Guardian's 
Convention Message which was mailed you a short time 
ago.  As there is a pilgrim leaving, he is taking the precaution 
of having this mailed in Europe.  
     I hope it reaches you in time for the Convention....

28 May 1954 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has instructed me to write you 
concerning an action recently taken by your National 
Assembly, as published in your January-February &Baha'i 
News, that &non-Baha'is may attend 19-Day Feasts if "the 
earnestness of their interest in the Faith" is vouched for by a 
declared believer.  
 
+P212 
     The Guardian wishes me to direct your attention to the 
fact that none of the institutions of the Faith nor its cardinal 
principles may be changed under any circumstances.  
     The 19-Day Feast is an institution of the Cause, first 
established by the &Bab, later confirmed by &Baha'u'llah, and 
now made a prominent part of the administrative order of 
the Faith.  These 19-Day Feasts are for the &Baha'is, and the 
&Baha'is exclusively, and no variation from this principle is 
permitted.  
     Thus the Guardian feels you should rescind the action 
taken by your Assembly in opening the Feasts to "near 
&Baha'is", as it is not consistent with the spirit of the 
administrative order for &non-Baha'is or near &Baha'is to 
attend the 19-Day Feasts, particularly the administrative 
portion of the Feast.  
     The Guardian realizes the spirit which animated you in 
making the suggested proposal, in order that the teaching 
work might go forward more aggressively; but he feels in 
the long run it would be detrimental to the Faith, and 
therefore should be rescinded as indicated above.  
     The Guardian sends you his loving greetings....  
 
 
8 June 1954 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has been greatly pleased with the 
achievements of the friends throughout the world during the 
first year of the Ten-Year Crusade.  Victories were won in 
all parts of the world, and on many fronts.  The Faith was 
established in 101 countries of the world, bringing the light 
of guidance to 229 countries and islands.  
     We now enter the second phase of the Ten-Year Crusade.  
 
+P213 
     The Guardian's message to the Convention has outlined the 
goals to be achieved during this second phase.  
     One of the important items was the purchase of 
&Haziratu'l-Quds for future National Spiritual Assemblies.  
The Guardian feels that immediate steps should be taken to 
fulfil a part of this project.  In all, there are 49 &Haziratu'l-Quds 
to be purchased--4 already are owned.  He feels that 
during the second year of the Crusade, 17 additional 
&Haziratu'l-Quds should be purchased.  These should not be 
elaborate structures, but modest houses, which can serve at 
the present time, as local &Haziratu'l-Quds, but which will be 
converted into National &Haziratu'l-Quds as soon as the 
National Assemblies are formed.  
     The Guardian feels that steps should be taken 
immediately to purchase the &Haziratu'l-Quds in Vienna.  A 
fund should be started so that the friends may contribute to 
this important project when they wish.  
     The Guardian has been informed that a small property 
has been procured in Vienna, to serve as a Headquarters.  
He is anxious to know if this property has been purchased, 
or is being rented.  If it has been purchased, and is an 
independent property, it of course can serve temporarily as 
a &Hazira for the local Assembly, and then later be made the 
National &Hazira.  If, on the other hand, the building is being 
rented, and it is satisfactory, efforts should be made to 
purchase it.  If it cannot be purchased, then some other small 
property should be bought.  The Guardian wishes it clearly 
understood that a &Hazira must be a piece of land owned by 
the &Baha'is, and not a rented piece of property.  
     The Guardian will appreciate advice from you as quickly 
as possible of the steps being taken to fulfill this important 
task of the second phase of the Ten-Year Plan.  He feels this 
property should be purchased during the current year....  
 
+P214 
P.S.--The Guardian requests that you inform all the 
friends that their most important duty at the present time is 
the fulfillment of the tasks of the Ten-Year Crusade.  This 
calls for the sacrifice of local activities in order that the 
national and international development of the Faith may go 
forward uninterruptedly.  No local institutions should be 
started.  The National Assembly should see that money is 
not spent on local centers at this time, and the friends 
should be encouraged to concentrate on the national and 
international activities of the Faith.  
 
 
25 June 1954 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     The letters of your Assembly dated June 18, August 11, 
September 2 (4), 13, October 14, November 9 and 24, 
1953, and January 16 (2), February 3, 5 (2), 7, 11, March 
7, April 19, May 12 and June 19, 1954, with their 
enclosures, as well as the material forwarded under separate 
cover, have all been received by the beloved Guardian, and 
he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He is sorry that pressure of work prevented him from 
writing more frequently to the National Spiritual 
Assemblies, including your own.  Indeed, he is beginning to 
wonder how much longer he can go on attending to the 
multiplying affairs of the Cause of today, and keeping up 
correspondence as well.  
     He is very pleased to see that the work in Germany is 
really going forward at a visibly more rapid rate.  The 
German friends, one of the oldest Communities in Europe, 
so devoted and loyal, and who have suffered so much 
 
+P215 
during two wars, are beginning at last to see the institutions 
of their Faith emerging in their native land in a more 
concrete form than the realm of hope and dreams.  
     The national &Haziratu'l-Quds, which was purchased so 
shortly after the end of the last world conflagration, has 
now been followed by the plan for the first &Baha'i Temple 
on European soil, a truly noble and inspiring undertaking.  
     In this connection he wishes to say that he is very sorry he 
could not agree to the proposals you sent him so far.  As 
your Assembly is aware, the &Baha'is all over the world are 
building up national institutions and purchasing, in various 
areas, Temple sites, etc.  It is only natural that each 
Assembly should feel justified in making an initial suitable 
investment for its Temple site or its national &Haziratu'l-Quds.  
However, the Guardian, to whom all the news comes 
from all over the world, is forced to face the fact that if your 
Assembly, the Canadian Assembly, the British Community, 
the Italian-Swiss Assembly etc. etc. each pays as heavy sums 
for its &Baha'i Temple site or national headquarters as they 
propose to in these reports, which they send him, the &Baha'i 
world would never be able to get out of debt.  Desirable as 
each place is, when considered from a local standpoint, it 
becomes on an international scale, a program that is 
financially impossible.  That is why he urged your Assembly 
to drastically curtail the area and the price.  He has done the 
same thing in many other parts of the world.  He hopes that 
you will shortly be able to purchase the land required.  
     There now remains the important consideration of a 
design for the &Mashriqu'l-Adhkar.  It does not matter 
whether it is executed by a &Baha'i or a &non-Baha'i architect, 
but the essential thing is that it must be beautiful and 
dignified.  There must be none of this hideous, exaggerated, 
bizarre style, which one sees in many modern buildings.  It is 
 
+P216 
not befitting for our House of Worship.  He thinks that you 
should impress this on any architects wishing to submit 
drawings.  The essentials of the design, as stipulated by 
&Abdu'l-Baha are that the building should be nine-sided, and 
circular in shape.  Aside from this, the architect is not 
restricted in any way in choosing his style of design.  
     Whenever you have a sufficient collection of drawings, he 
would be pleased to receive them, and give you his advice.  
     A very large building at this time is not necessary, as the 
expense would overtax our resources too heavily; and the 
Persian &Baha'is, who are so much more numerous, will have 
to, during the coming nine years, build a much larger and 
more pretentious structure in &Tihran, and consequently a 
more expensive one.  
     Regarding the matter of ...:  individual &Baha'is are 
always encouraged to travel and teach, and no doubt he has 
been of much assistance in Germany.  The Guardian, 
however, feels your Assembly was quite right in considering 
that your limited financial resources should be spent 
supporting pioneers, rather than a travelling teacher in 
Germany.  
     The eagerness of the friends to serve, often carries them 
away, and they forget that a sound sense of business 
management is also much needed, if we are to harbour our 
resources and accomplish all our goals.  
     He was delighted to see that so many of the &Baha'is from 
Germany were present at the Stockholm Conference, and 
that they were able to meet with their colleagues from 
Austria.  He hopes that your teaching work in Austria will 
make marked progress during the present year.  The Cause 
there has been too long neglected, and undoubtedly there is 
a very fertile field, waiting only to be cultivated, in order to 
yield a rich harvest.  
 
+P217 
     It has indeed been a great blessing to the German 
Community to receive the visits of so many Hands of the 
Cause of God from abroad during the past year.  
     He hopes that the auxiliary Board for Europe recently 
established, will be of great help in the work to be carried 
out by the administrative bodies throughout Europe.  
     The most important thing is to keep the pioneer 
territories which have been settled open.  There must be no 
lapse.  The friends must be urged to remain at their posts at 
all costs.  They must remember the glorious example of 
Marion Jack, who recently passed away in Bulgaria, after 
almost 30 years of devoting her life to teaching the Faith in 
that country of her choice.  As many of you who knew her 
personally will recall, her health was very bad, as far back 
as 1935, when she attended the Esslingen Summer School.  
It certainly never improved.  She was bombed, evacuated, 
she slept in some drafty, cold room in a school in the 
country, was often, we have reason to believe, almost 
hungry, and insufficiently clad after the war, due to 
difficulties in getting money through to her in an Soviet-dominated 
territory.  She never mastered the language, and 
was without friends of her own country; and yet, she 
persevered, and, in spite of even the Guardian's pleas that 
she leave the country during the worst years of the war, 
remained at her post, and won for herself imperishable 
fame, her resting-place becoming a shrine in Bulgaria, 
which the people of that country will increasingly honour 
and cherish.  
     It is to this glorious soul that the present generation of 
pioneers must look for inspiration and example.  
     He is very happy that the German &Baha'is have been able 
to settle in Crete and the Frisian Islands, a great step 
forward, when one realizes how much their activities have 
 
+P218 
been circumscribed, during the past thirty years, by 
circumstances over which they had no control.  
     He thanks you for sending him ten copies of each of your 
new publications, and would like you to continue doing so, 
as any new literature comes out.  
     So far he has not received any copies of "God Passes By" 
in German, but is hoping to do so.  
     He appreciates very much the sentiments you expressed to 
him in connection with the loss of our dear Hands of the 
Cause, Mr. Schopflocher and Mrs. Baker.  The friends 
everywhere must try and make up for the work these 
devoted and consecrated souls would have done, had they 
not passed to the &Abha Kingdom.  In this way they can best 
express their admiration and gratitude.  
     He is very happy to see that your National Convention 
has been so successful, and that the influence of the future 
Temple is already being felt, and attracting the hearts of the 
believers, including many previously inactive.  It shows what 
these &Baha'i institutions are going to do as they develop.  
     You may be sure that he remembers all the members of 
your Assembly in his loving prayers in the holy Shrines, and 
supplicates that the German and Austrian &Baha'i 
Communities may exceed all their past records of 
achievement during this present &Baha'i year....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     The achievements of the German and Austrian &Baha'i 
communities, since the launching of the Ten-Year Global 
Crusade, embarked upon by the followers of the Faith of 
&Baha'u'llah, mark a notable advancement in the progress 
and consolidation of the Faith in the heart of the European 
continent.  The weighty and historic task so valiantly 
shouldered by both of these communities has been 
 
+P219 
splendidly initiated, and must, as the Plan unfolds, be 
prosecuted with increasing vigilance, unswerving resolve, 
whole-hearted consecration, complete unity, and exemplary 
steadfastness.  
     The greatest, most pressing and sacred enterprise, 
challenging the spirit and resources of all the members of 
both of these communities--the purchase of the land, for 
the first &Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of Europe and the prompt 
initiation of measures for its construction--demands, 
during this present phase of the Crusade, the utmost 
concentration of effort, and the most sublime sacrifice on 
the part of the German and Austrian believers--an effort 
and sacrifice in which their brethren, in both the East, and 
the West, will gladly participate, as a token of their 
appreciation of the historic significance of this mighty 
institution destined to be firmly established and radiate its 
beneficent influence in the very heart of that continent.  
     The purchase of the site must be expedited, the selection 
of a befitting design for so glorious an edifice must be made 
with as little delay as possible, and the preliminary steps for 
the excavation of the foundations must be undertaken with 
care, promptitude and determination.  
     The rise of this symbol and harbinger of the World Order 
of &Baha'u'llah, as yet in the embryonic stage of its 
development, amidst the confusion, the anxieties, the 
rivalries and the recurrent crises that mark the decline of a 
moribund civilization, will, no doubt, lend a tremendous 
impetus to the onward march of the Faith in all the 
continents of the Globe, and will, more than any other 
single act, direct the attention of the spiritually 
impoverished, the economically afflicted, the socially 
disturbed, and the morally disoriented masses of a sorely 
tried continent to its nascent institutions.  
 
+P220 
     Parallel with these measures, destined to contribute so 
effectively to the rise and establishment of the 
Administrative Order of the Faith in both Germany and 
Austria, a systematic effort must be exerted by the national 
elected representatives of the &Baha'i communities in these 
two countries to multiply, as speedily as possible, the 
assemblies, groups and isolated centres, through a wider 
dispersal on the part of the believers, and the launching of 
an intensive campaign of teaching designed to increase, 
swiftly and steadily the number of the active supporters of 
the Faith.  
     The pioneers who have so valiantly settled in the virgin 
areas assigned to the National Spiritual Assembly of the 
&Baha'is of Germany and Austria, must, however great the 
sacrifice, safeguard the prizes so laboriously won, and 
strive, by every means in their power, to consolidate, 
through extensive teaching work, their splendid and 
unforgettable achievements.  
     While this double process of multiplication of &Baha'i 
centres, and development of the newly opened areas, is 
being assiduously carried out, a no less notable progress 
must be made in the consolidation of these two 
communities, through the initiation of local incorporations 
which will pave the way for the establishment of local &Baha'i 
endowments, and will serve to reinforce the foundations of 
all local &Baha'i communities.  
     The establishment of a national &Haziratu'l-Quds in the 
capital city of Austria, as well as of national endowments in 
that country--measures that will herald the formation of 
an independent National Spiritual Assembly, and the 
erection of yet another pillar of the Universal House of 
Justice, in the heart of the European continent--should be 
 
+P221 
regarded as the paramount objectives of this second phase 
of the Ten-Year Crusade which we are now entering.  
     No less vital and urgent is the task of establishing, in the 
course of this second stage in the unfoldment of this world 
spiritual Crusade, of a &Baha'i Publishing Trust, similar, in 
its essentials, to the one already functioning in the British 
Isles, and of lending a fresh impetus to the translation, the 
publication and dissemination of &Baha'i literature in the 
German language--a task which will greatly accelerate the 
all-important teaching work, and enhance the prestige of 
the Faith, and promote the vital interests of its institutions.  
     The Community of the German and Austrian believers, 
the recipient of such signal honours from the Center of 
&Baha'u'llah's Covenant in the past; born and nurtured in its 
infancy under His fostering care in the course of the 
concluding decades of the Apostolic Age of the Faith; 
eminently successful in laying the foundations of its 
Administrative Order in the years immediately following 
His Ascension; emerging, purified and strengthened, from 
the fire of a severe and prolonged ordeal after the conclusion 
of the second world war; demonstrating its capacity and 
resilience through the initiation and prosecution of a 
carefully designed Plan, despite the exhaustion of a terrible 
and harrowing conflict that endangered its life and shook it 
to its foundations,--such a community has now risen to 
assume its rightful place in the world-encompassing 
Crusade launched by the followers of &Baha'u'llah; has 
splendidly initiated its Ten-Year Plan through the 
inauguration of its glorious Mission in foreign fields, and is 
now forging ahead, with magnificent courage, resolution, 
thoroughness, and fidelity, in its endeavour to win fresh 
laurels in the course of this second and newly opened stage 
in the unfoldment of the Plan to which it stands committed.  
 
+P222 
     May the vision of its members remain undimmed, their 
resolution never flag, their steps never falter.  May they, as 
the years go by, demonstrate afresh the solidity of their 
faith, the nobility of their motives, the sublimity of their 
devotion, the tenacity of their resolution, in the service of a 
Faith they have served so devotedly in the past and which 
they will, undoubtedly, promote with unabated zeal, in the 
future, 
                                    Your true brother, 
                                                Shoghi 
 
 
28 June 1954 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your loving letter of June 9th has come to hand, telling of 
the activities of the friends in connection with the 
development of the teaching work in Germany and Austria, 
as well as in the pioneering fields.  
     So far as the questions you ask are concerned, the 
following will answer question Number 1, as this is a matter 
which the Guardian has elucidated.  
     The direction of the pioneers is entirely in the hands of the 
National Assemblies under whom they are serving.  The 
Guardian simply enunciates the principle, and then it is up 
to the National Assemblies to apply that principle.  The 
principle is that pioneers entering the pioneer field should 
realize that they are going there to represent the Cause, in 
fact, to be the Cause.  
     Their minds and their hearts should be centered in their 
new tasks and in their new environment.  They should not 
be thinking of when they can return home, or when they can 
go somewhere else.  Only when the Faith is firmly 
 
+P223 
established should they give any thought to moving, and 
then, only in consultation with the National Assembly.  
     So far as pioneers taking a holiday is concerned, that is 
entirely in the hands of the National Assembly.  You can 
appreciate that all of this depends upon location, and to a 
certain extent, funds.  If a person feels they need a little 
change for a week or two, that of course is something which 
should be handled in each case.  
     The Guardian does not wish to make any hard and fast 
rules on any of these matters.  
     I will write you again in response to the other questions 
when the Guardian has given his advice....  
 
 
23 July 1954 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Will you please refer to your letter of June 9th and my 
acknowledgment of June 28th, in which you raise certain 
questions.  The beloved Guardian has directed me to give 
you the answers as follows:  
     Number 2:  He feels your plan of giving individuals, who 
became &Baha'is in France, but who have not yet given up 
their church affiliation, one year in which to do so, is 
satisfactory.  
     Number 3:  Up to the age of 15 years, children are under 
the direction of their parents.  At the age of 15, they may 
declare their Faith as a conviction, and be registered as 
&Baha'i youth, whether the parents are &Baha'is or not.  
Children under the age of 15, of &Baha'i parents, who wish to 
attend meetings and associate with the friends as &Baha'is 
may do so.  If &non-Baha'i parents permit a child of less than 
 
+P224 
15 to attend &Baha'i meetings, and in fact, to be a &Baha'i, this 
is likewise permissible.  
     Number 4:  The beloved Guardian instructs that 
whenever an Assembly loses some members between the 
&Ridvan periods, bringing the membership to less than 9, the 
Assembly reverts immediately to Group status.  However, 
when they get a sufficient number of new members to reach 
9, then they immediately become an Assembly again.  
     The beloved Guardian greatly values your devoted 
services to the Faith, and the manner in which you are 
undertaking the heavy responsibilities of propagating the 
Faith, as well as consolidating its institutions.  
     He assures you of his prayers in your behalf, and sends 
you his loving greetings....

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The note of loving greeting, which was signed by all those 
present at the Summer School, has been received by the 
beloved Guardian, and this is just a brief note of 
acknowledgment on his behalf.  
     He was very happy to see that it was possible for so many 
of the friends to be present, and that you had the bounty of 
having the favored Hand of the Cause, Dr. &Muhlschlegel, 
with you.  He feels sure such a gathering must have released 
new strength and zeal; and that each one will now 
determine to double or even treble his past efforts during the 
second year of this historic Ten-Year Crusade.  
     He sends you all his loving greetings....  
 
+P225 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty bless your efforts, aid you to promote, 
at all times, the vital interests of His Faith, and contribute 
continually to the multiplication and consolidation of its 
nascent and divinely appointed institutions, 
                                    Your true brother, 
                                               Shoghi

Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     This will acknowledge receipt of your kind letter of 
November 9th, advising that you have received the gift of 
Three Thousand Dollars, which the beloved Guardian has 
sent for your Temple fund.  
     I will inform the Guardian of your deep appreciation of 
his gift.  
     So far as the establishment of the Israel Branch of the 
National Spiritual Assembly of Germany and Austria is 
concerned, there is nothing for you to do in connection 
therewith at this time.  This matter will be handled here in 
the Holy Land.  When it is consummated, it may be 
necessary and advisable for your National Assembly to pass 
certain resolutions in connection with it, but I will inform 
you about this in due course.  
     At the moment it does not seem propitious for the 
establishment of further Israel Branches at this time; and the 
Guardian has therefore instructed that this matter be 
delayed a little longer.  You may be sure however it will be 
taken care of in due course.  
     With loving greetings to you and all the members of the 
National Assembly....

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of November 26th was received by the 
beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you 
on his behalf.  
     He is very happy to see the spirit of love and unity 
animating you, because without this no work can go 
forward in the Cause of God.  Personal differences of 
opinion, of character etc. must melt away in the love of the 
friends for &Baha'u'llah, and their desire to serve His Cause.  
     He hopes that in the near future the Vienna Community 
will have its &Haziratu'l-Quds, to which he attaches the 
greatest importance, as it will be the visible sign of the firm 
foundation on which that Community stands.  
     He will pray for you all, and for the rapid spread of the 
Faith through your efforts....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty bless your meritorious efforts, reward 
you abundantly for your valued and constant services, and 
enable you to achieve great and memorable victories in the 
days to come, 
                                    Your true brother,

Dear Mrs. Grossmann:  
     Your loving letter of December 27th is here on my return 
from Europe.  
     I am under the impression you asked me when in 
Germany whether the message of our Beloved Guardian of 
 
+P227 
November 27th, should be shared with the Friends.  In any 
event, the Guardian surely does wish this important 
message shared with all the Friends.  While the wording of 
the last paragraph might seem a little obscure, yet the 
Guardian's intention was that all National Assemblies 
should be sent a copy, and they in turn release it to the 
Friends.  
     We have corrected the records to show that the number of 
declared Adherents to the Faith in Iraklion, Crete is one, 
and not two....  
 
 
10 February 1955 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The Beloved Guardian has directed that I write you in 
connection with the Temple project for Germany.  
     He is anxious to receive the latest word with regard to the 
purchase of the site for the Temple, hoping all the problems 
have now cleared up, or will soon be cleared up and 
ownership be vested with your body.  
     He also feels that you should proceed with the 
preparation of designs for the Temple, which he 
understands you will arrange by means of a competition of 
architects.  He feels you should proceed with this phase of 
the Temple regardless of the question of land ownership.  
Time is moving along rapidly, and he hopes it will not be 
too long before the design is chosen.  
     In passing, there is one point to be mentioned; and that is 
that the Temple in Wilmette does not constitute a pattern 
for other Temples, nor does it represent a new type of 
&Baha'i architecture.  Therefore it is not necessary for your 
architects to endeavour to follow that pattern.  What should 
 
+P228 
be done is to follow the Master's instructions as to the 
Temple, and then create something that will be desirable 
and appropriate for your area....  
 
 
23 February 1955 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian is very closely watching the 
development of the Ten Year Crusade on all fronts.  One of 
the goals of the second phase of the Ten Year Crusade is the 
incorporation of local and national assemblies.  
     The Guardian is hoping that your National Assembly 
may take this important matter in hand, so that during the 
coming &Baha'i year, as many as possible of your local 
assemblies will become incorporated.  He feels this is a very 
important activity, and one which you should follow up just 
as closely as possible.  
     Will you please send me a report for the Guardian of any 
activities along this line which are underway; and if not, 
what can be done to set such a program in motion.  
     It is needless for me to comment of course on the fact that 
another one of the major objectives of the second phase of 
the Ten Year Crusade is the multiplication of &Baha'i centers, 
and particularly the development of &Baha'i groups into 
assemblies.  The way in which this can be best accomplished 
is by the &Baha'is in the larger centers dispersing to weak 
areas or to entirely new centers.  
     The Guardian sends you his loving greetings....  
 
+P229 
23 February 1955 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Please refer to copy of my letter of April 20th to Dr. 
Giachery, with a copy to you, with regard to specifications 
for &Baha'i Temples.  
     The Beloved Guardian has asked me to write to you, 
explaining that while the question of a Dome for a &Baha'i 
Temple, is not specified in the Teachings, yet he feels that 
for the Temple in Germany, you should plan a building with 
a central Dome.  He thinks it would enhance the beauty of 
the structure now being planned for Frankfurt....  
 
 
8 March 1955 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian is very anxious to secure, as 
quickly as possible, data concerning the &Haziratu'l-Quds 
which have been acquired in connection with the goals of 
the Ten Year Crusade.  To this end, he would very greatly 
appreciate your sending me by return air mail the 
information concerning the &Haziratu'l-Quds in Vienna.  
     He would like to know the area of land involved, the size 
of the building, so far as number of rooms is concerned, the 
original purchase price of the &Haziratu'l-Quds, the expenses 
of the transaction, and then the total cost.  
     The Guardian asks that this be sent to me by return air 
mail....  
 
+P230 
11 March 1955 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     Your loving letter of February 25th has just come to 
hand.  
     It was a great pleasure for me to have been able to visit the 
friends in Frankfurt and Stuttgart; and we will long 
remember the loving hospitality which was extended to us 
by all the friends.  
     I do not know what more can be done in behalf of...  
Certain members if the American N.S.A. are in close touch 
with the authorities in Washington; and if they have written 
you that nothing more can be done, I think that is the last 
word; at least I have nothing more which I can suggest.  
     Please give my deep love to all the members of the 
National Assembly....  
 
 
29 March 1955 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     On April 21st we will enter the last year of the second 
phase of the Ten Year Crusade.  As you know, one of the 
objectives of this second phase is the rapid multiplication of 
Assemblies, Groups and Centres throughout the world.  
     During the past year, a great deal has been accomplished 
by the friends in their efforts to disperse from the large 
centres of population in order to build up the goal cities and 
establish new centres.  However we have not accomplished a 
great deal in the way of increasing the number of &Baha'is, 
nor the number of Spiritual Assemblies.  
 
+P231 
     The beloved Guardian sincerely hopes you will make it a 
point of major study and consideration on the part of your 
Assembly, so that the entire Community may lend itself to 
the accomplishment of this great goal during the coming 
year.  Foundations must be laid for many more Assemblies.  
The friends must disperse from the large centres of 
population.  Our teaching work must become so sanctified 
and penetrating that many, many souls will be confirmed.  
The friends should go forward on this great task in a very 
determined manner in order to establish as many new 
Assemblies during the coming year as are possible.  
     In letters which have come to the beloved Guardian, he 
has noted the friends feel there is no need to establish new 
Assemblies until 1963.  
     The Ten Year Crusade ends in 1963; but as many of the 
goals should be won as quickly as is possible.  It should 
certainly be clear to all of the friends that we cannot hold off 
on winning the various goals of our tasks until the last year 
of the Crusade.  They should be won just as quickly as 
possible.  Furthermore, there are many tasks of the Crusade 
which the Guardian is not launching until preliminary goals 
have been won.  For instance, it would be impossible to 
establish National Assemblies in all of the areas proposed 
until there are more &Baha'is, more Groups and more 
Assemblies in those countries.  
     On the home front, further tasks are dependent upon the 
winning of victories now.  The Guardian hopes the keynote 
of the teaching work on the home front during the current 
year will be the dispersion of the friends on an 
unprecedented scale, and the winning of as many 
Assemblies as is possible....  
 
+P232 
20 April 1955 
 
Dear Ugo:  
     I have your favor of April 10th, telling of your visit with 
the German Architect, Prof. Dr. Bartning, and his 
explanation to you of the elements to be incorporated in the 
new Temple for Germany.  
     The Beloved Guardian explains that there is no 
requirement for one window to be oriented toward the East.  
In fact, he feels this should not be done; otherwise it will 
take on a practice of the Moslems with regard to their 
prayer niche, etc.  I am sending a copy of this note to the 
German NSA, so they will understand.  
     The Guardian has also indicated that there is nothing in 
the teaching requiring one dome for the building, in fact, 
any dome.  It is of course more beautiful, generally to have a 
dome, or even domes, but that is not a necessary 
requirement of the Temple.  
     Likewise the Guardian indicates, it is not essential that 
there be nine doors.  
     The real requisite is that the building should be circular in 
shape, having nine sides; that there should be nine gardens, 
walks, etc....

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian was very happy indeed to learn of 
the confirmation of an additional &Baha'i in the Island of 
Crete.  
     The Guardian is very anxious to know the racial 
background of the new &Baha'is in these new areas.  I am 
wondering therefore if you could let me know what the 
nationality is of the first new &Baha'i in Crete, as well as this 
second &Baha'i.  
     The Guardian is anxious to know if either one of these 
two are pure Greek stock....  
 
 
2 August 1955 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     Your letters of June 11, July 16 and 22, August 30, 
October 12 and 17, November 2 and 17 and December 10, 
1954; and January 31 and February 19, April 28 and May 
21, 1955, with their various enclosures, have all been 
 
+P234 
recived by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me 
to answer you on his behalf.  
     As the work of the Ten-Year Crusade steadily grows, he 
finds it more and more difficult to correspond with the 
National Assemblies frequently; and indeed is wondering 
what will be the situation in a few years' time, when we have 
so many additional National Bodies.  This explains why you 
have not heard from him before.  
     He was very happy to hear that the Vienna &Haziratu'l-Quds 
has been purchased, as this eliminates one of the 
important goals assigned to your Assembly under the Ten-Year 
Plan.  He will be pleased to see photographs of the 
building.  
     He feels that your action in advising the Crete pioneers to 
be very discreet in all respects, and your decision to 
correspond with them for the time being through their 
parents, were very wise.  
     The friends who have gone forth to new lands cannot be 
too careful.  Unless they can stay long enough to convert at 
least a small group of people, who will be firmly grounded 
in the Faith, and continue to work if they are forced to 
leave, a great deal of time and money will have been wasted, 
and the progress of the Plan suffer a serious setback.  
     He will certainly pray for the pioneers there, for their 
protection and their guidance.  They should by all means 
persevere and act discreetly.  
     He was very satisfied to hear of the progress made at the 
Teaching Conference held in Frankfurt under the aegis of 
the European Hands.  He feels sure that this helped to 
stimulate and coordinate the work.  Association and 
consultation, as &Abdu'l-Baha so repeatedly emphasized, 
have a great effect on the friends, and enable them to see the 
work of the Cause as a whole, rather than as a small local 
 
+P235 
enterprise in which their personalities and other people's 
personalities often conflict; and challenge them to arise and 
go forth into new fields, in order to spread the Faith far and 
wide.  
     The Guardian attaches the greatest importance to the 
Temple enterprise.  He feels that if, for any reason, you do 
not win the case and get permission to build the Temple on 
the land you have already chosen, a new piece of land must 
be speedily bought.  He is hoping that the case will be 
satisfactorily settled, and that there will be no necessity for 
you to look further.  
     The preparation of designs for the Temple he feels, 
however, should not wait upon the conclusion of the court 
case.  It is going to take some time to receive designs, to 
forward them to him for his advice, and to incorporate any 
possible changes that may be deemed necessary, if one of the 
designs is found satisfactory.  He therefore advises you to 
open the competition as soon as you can, and not lose any 
more time.  
     He wishes at this juncture to stress to your Assembly the 
need for economy.  The Temple must naturally be a 
dignified and worthy edifice.  He does not consider that any 
of these modernistic experiments in architecture are at all 
suitable for a building of this nature, lacking as they so often 
do, beauty and dignity.  
     He also considers that the building should be a relatively 
small one, both because of the size of the Community in 
Germany, and the financial resources of the Faith at 
present.  The most important thing of all is to build this first 
Temple on European soil.  
     In the days when &Abdu'l-Baha was urging the American 
&Baha'is to build the first &Mashriqu'l-Adhkar of the western 
world, He repeatedly emphasized that it could be a modest 
 
+P236 
building, and that the important thing was the spiritual 
element that this House of Worship in the name of 
&Baha'u'llah should be raised in the heart of America.  The 
same thing applies now to your Temple in Germany.  Size 
and pretentiousness are not important.  The important thing 
is that the building should be speedily erected, and be a 
financial possibility, not placing, as the American Temple, a 
terrible strain on the friends for years to come.  
     He is happy to see that the German friends have been 
able, during the last few years, to move about much more, 
attend conferences in other European countries, go forth as 
pioneers, and gradually increase the number of centres in 
Germany and Austria.  He attaches the greatest importance 
to this because one of the main tasks of your Assembly is to 
insure that Austria will have an independent National 
Assembly by the end of the Plan; and she cannot do this 
unless she multiplies her Spiritual Assemblies in order to 
build a broad foundation for the National Body.  He hopes 
you will constantly encourage the Vienna &Baha'is and the 
isolated believers in Austria to increase their teaching 
activities, to strengthen the work of the Faith, to pioneer in 
new centres, and, above all, to be united; as unity is one of 
the greatest forces at our disposal for achieving the work of 
the Cause.  
     He assures you one and all that he remembers you most 
lovingly in his prayers in the holy Shrine, and supplicates for 
the removal of every obstacle in your path and the 
attainment of all your goals....  
     P.S.  The Guardian wishes particularly to thank you all 
for your loving message to him on the occasion of &Ridvan, 
which he appreciated receiving very much.  He assures you 
all that he prays that great victories may attend your efforts 
to spread the Faith and consolidate its foundations.  
 
+P237 
          [From the Guardian:]  
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     The steady extension and consolidation of the activities in 
which the members of the &Baha'i communities in Germany 
and Austria are so devotedly, so unitedly and strenuously 
engaged, have greatly cheered my heart, heightened my 
admiration for them, and reinforced my hopes for the 
triumphant conclusion of their collective enterprises 
undertaken in accordance with the provisions of the Ten-Year 
Plan.  
     By virtue of the important position they occupy in the 
heart of the European continent; singled out for special 
favours by the Center of &Baha'u'llah's Covenant among their 
sister communities in that same continent; distinguished 
through the appointment of two Hands of the Cause from 
among their members; entrusted with the tremendous and 
sacred responsibility of erecting the first &Baha'i House of 
Worship on European soil; displaying, on the morrow of 
the ordeals which have for so long and so cruelly afflicted 
them, a virility, a courage, a fidelity worthy of emulation by 
their sister communities not only in neighbouring lands but 
throughout the &Baha'i world, these twin communities, 
destined through their common language, racial 
characteristics and traditions to play a notable and distinct 
part in the world-wide progress of the Faith in both the 
European and Asiatic continents, must continue to forge 
ahead, with inflexible resolve, unshakable faith, undimmed 
vision, and unabated vigour, along the road leading them to 
the fulfilment of their high destiny.  
     The steady increase in the number of the adherents of the 
Faith in both countries and the multiplication of isolated 
centres, groups and local assemblies is a task of primary 
importance to which they must direct special attention 
during the last year of the second phase of this world-embracing 
 
+P238 
spiritual Crusade.  Equally vital in sacredness 
and importance is the definite settlement of the issue that 
has arisen in connexion with the purchase of the site of the 
future Temple in the neighbourhood of Frankfurt, as well as 
the selection of its design, as essential preliminaries to the 
excavation of its foundations and the erection of its 
structure.  Both of these require the concentrated and 
sustained attention of the elected representatives of these 
communities, whose task is to expedite this pre-eminent 
undertaking destined to exert a far-reaching spiritual 
influence on the fortunes of the Faith not only in Germany 
and Austria but throughout the European continent and 
even far beyond its borders.  
     Still another obligation that must under no circumstances 
be lost sight of or neglected is the incorporation of definitely 
established local assemblies in these two adjoining 
countries, a process that will greatly consolidate the 
administrative foundations of the Faith and enhance its 
prestige in the European continent.  
     The adoption of special measures by these same elected 
national representatives, designed to hasten the emergence 
of an independent National Spiritual Assembly in Austria, is 
yet another duty which calls for urgent and earnest 
consideration on their part and one which, if worthily 
performed, will lend a tremendous impetus to the progress 
of the Faith in a country occupying so central a position in 
Europe, so rich in its past history, and blessed by the 
footsteps of &Abdu'l-Baha.  
     The splendid work accomplished by German pioneers in 
virgin territories in both the North and South of Europe, 
auguring well for the accomplishment of a similar mission in 
the Eastern territories forming part of their alloted task 
under the Ten-Year Plan, must be jealously safeguarded and 
 
+P239 
continually reinforced, as it constitutes a prelude to the 
victories that must needs be won, in the course of future 
Plans, on the eastern confines of that continent and even as 
far afield as the heart of Asia.  
     Nor must the establishment of the projected &Baha'i 
Publishing Trust be delayed, as it constitutes one of vital 
objectives of the Crusade on which the German &Baha'i 
community has embarked.  
     No sacrifice can be deemed too great for the attainment of 
these shining goals and the winning of such precious prizes.  
The members of these closely knit communities must arise 
as never before, and brace themselves for a still greater 
output of energy, and a still more convincing display of 
those qualities that have distinguished their stewardship to 
the Faith of &Baha'u'llah, and prepare to enter victoriously 
upon the third phase of the Ten-Year Plan during the 
concluding months of this current year.  
     The tragic sufferings afflicting their brethren in 
&Baha'u'llah's native land, involving a setback in the projects 
of this persecuted community for the erection of its Mother 
Temple in &Tihran, must reinforce their resolve to speed the 
erection of a corresponding House of Worship in the 
heart of Europe.  The efforts of their national elected 
representatives, strenuous as they have been in recent 
months, must be doubled, nay trebled, in order to offset, in 
this particular and most important field, the inevitable and 
deplorable delay in the accomplishment of so meritorious, 
so momentous and historic a task.  
     Unperturbed by the clamour of inveterate, powerful and 
malicious adversaries in the land of the birth of their Faith; 
undaunted by the opposition which exponents of religious 
orthodoxy are, to a lesser degree, now beginning to show in 
their own homeland, these same elected representatives, 
 
+P240 
must press forward, resolutely, and confront and speedily 
surmount whatever obstacles now stand in their path.  
     Theirs is a responsibility which, at this historic and 
crucial stage in the evolution of their precious and beloved 
Faith, they can neither minimize nor neglect.  Theirs is a 
God-sent opportunity to demonstrate, at this grave hour 
through which the overwhelming majority of their brethren 
are passing, the incorruptible character of their faith, the 
indomitable spirit which animates them, the sublimity of the 
principles which motivate their action, providing thereby an 
abiding and sorely needed consolation to the victims of the 
brutal, the wide spread and repeated persecutions engulfing 
so many of their co-religionists in the cradle of their Faith.  
     That they may prove themselves worthy of their high 
calling; that they may set an inspiring example to their co-workers 
in both Hemispheres, through the number and 
quality of their accomplishments; that they may discharge, 
in their entirety, the manifold responsibilities assured under 
a Plan constituting so notable a stage in the accomplishment 
of the Glorious mission envisioned for them by &Abdu'l-Baha, 
is the object of my unceasing prayers when supplicating 
at the threshold of His Shrine.  
     May His watchful, His sustaining and ever loving Spirit 
guide every step they take, bless every effort they exert, and 
fulfil every hope they cherish, in the pursuit of the victories 
they have resolutely set themselves to achieve.

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian is very anxious indeed to have the 
latest word in connection with the purchase of the 
 
+P241 
Templeland in Germany, and the development of the design 
for the Temple.  
     Can you write me by return mail, letting me know just 
what the status is of both these very important matters?  
     He is anxious that the work on the Temple be expedited 
in every way; as he is fearful if the work does not begin 
soon, it may be found impossible to complete the task 
within the Ten Year period.  
     If you will write me, giving full details, it will be greatly 
appreciated by him....

loving prayers; and supplicates that they may receive the 
necessary strength and guidance to carry forward in a 
befitting manner their share in this particular phase of the 
World Spiritual Crusade....

     YOUR CABLE OCTOBER 15 PRESUME DECISION 
TEMPLE DESIGN HAS NO BEARING ON COURT DECISION 
OCTOBER 26 IS THIS CORRECT?  DO YOU HAVE 
ADVANCE INFORMATION AS TO WHAT DECISION WILL 
BE?  GUARDIAN HAS MADE NO DECISION BUT SEEMS 
PREFER AZAMAT BY HOPFER STUTTGART.  PLEASE 
CABLE PROPOSED HEIGHT AND WIDTH.  HAVE YOU ANY 
IDEA COST OF CONSTRUCTION....  
 
 
19 October 1955 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     I cabled you at the instruction of our beloved Guardian 
today as follows:  
     "Your cable October 15 presume decision temple design 
has no bearing on court decision October 26 is this correct?  
Do you have advance information as to what decision 
will be?  Guardian has made no decision but seems to 
prefer Azamat by Hopfer Stuttgart.  Please cable proposed 
height and width.  Have you any idea of cost of 
construction".  
     As the cable indicates, it is my understanding that the 
decision with regard to Temple design has nothing to do 
 
+P243 
with the decision in the court case, but that you wished the 
Guardian's decision in order to assist in appropriate 
publicity.  We hope and pray that the decision will be 
favorable.  
     In reviewing these specifications which you have set up 
for the Temple, the Guardian wishes to call your attention 
to the fact that you have included some items in the 
specifications which are not necessary, and in fact are 
definitely not a part of a &Baha'i Temple, as follows:  
     Your No. 14--Assembly Hall.  The Temple is for 
worship only, and no Assembly Hall is permissible.  (In 
America the basement of the Temple has been temporarily 
used as a Foundation Hall.)  This has been due to the long 
time taken to construct the building etc.  
     No. 17--Conference Rooms.  Inasmuch as the Temple is 
for worship only, conference rooms are not required.  
     No. 18--Library and Archives.  These facilities are not 
required nor desirable in a House of Worship.  
     No. 19 and 20--Kitchen Facilities.  These are not 
required, as food is not to be served in the Temple.  The 
Temple is for prayer and worship only.  
     No. 27--Air Raid Shelters.  These are not required.  
     No. 30--Caretaker's House.  This is not required at the 
present time, as the caretaker can sleep in one of the spare 
rooms of the Temple.  
     The Guardian feels it important to direct your attention to 
the fact that the Temple must be built just as economically 
as possible, and to provide only the facilities which are 
prescribed for a House of Worship.  The Cause is under such 
heavy expense at the present time that we cannot undertake 
the construction of buildings which require too great an 
outlay of funds.  
 
+P244 
     The Guardian would appreciate your having some 
preliminary estimates made just as quickly as possible of 
what it would cost to build the Temple designated as 
"Azamat".  He likewise would like you to send him now just 
as many details as possible concerning the construction of 
this building, materials to be used etc.  
     I presume by the time this letter reaches you, you will 
have cabled the proposed height and width.  
     The Guardian would greatly value your giving him the 
detailed information regarding "Azamat" just as promptly 
as possible....  
 
 
28 October 1955 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of September 26th has been received by the 
beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you 
on his behalf.  
     As you know, he is most happy that the believers in 
Vienna have their own Center, and that in a short time it 
will be ready for &Baha'i service.  
     These important institutions of the Faith are in 
themselves great teachers.  The spirit of love and unity 
among the friends in discussing, arranging and carrying out 
the activities of the Faith in their &Haziratu'l-Quds, will 
become as a magnet which will attract to them divine 
bounties.  The Guardian is hoping from this Center the Faith 
will be carried, not only throughout Vienna, but to other 
cities in Austria as well....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty, Whose Cause you serve with such 
courage, devotion and perseverance, guide and sustain you, 
 
+P245 
and aid you to render His Faith notable services in the days 
to come, 
                                    Your true brother, 
                                              Shoghi 
 
 
10 November 1955 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friend:  
     The beloved Guardian has reviewed very carefully your 
recent letter dealing with the designs for the Temple to be 
built in Germany.  He wishes the following explanations to 
be made to you, and I am therefore enumerating them, so 
that there may be no misunderstanding.  
     1.  The Guardian has not definitely chosen the Temple 
design "Azamat" as the one for the Temple in Germany.  Of 
the submissions which have been made up to this time, he 
feels this is the one that is best susceptible of development 
for the final design of the Temple.  He wishes it clear 
however that up to the present he has not definitely accepted 
this design.  
     2.  The Guardian does not wish to interfere unduly with 
the national tastes nor the actions of the National Assembly; 
but he attaches the utmost importance to the Temple in 
Eschborn, as this is the first Temple in Europe, and the only 
one to be constructed in Europe during the Ten Year 
Crusade.  Therefore he feels that this House of Worship 
must represent throughout Europe the dignity and spirit of 
the Faith.  
     3.  The Guardian therefore feels that we should not accept 
an ultra-modern building, which represents more or less the 
current spirit of the time, rather than the delicate 
 
+P246 
architectural beauty which the spirit of the Faith should 
engender.  
     4.  The Guardian would be happy if your Assembly could 
produce a design of a building, graceful in outline, with a 
dome.  If they can do this he will be very pleased.  The main 
thing for the architect to consider is the mass of the 
building, the outline of the building and its architectural 
beauty.  Most of the sacred buildings, including the Temple 
at Wilmette, include elements of the previous schools of 
architecture in an ensemble that seems to present something 
new.  He thinks the architects should study the graceful mass 
of the Wilmette Temple, of the design of Mr. Remey for the 
Temple on Mt. Carmel, and the Shrine of the &Bab, as well as 
the outline of the domes of important buildings, particularly 
the dome of St. Peters in Rome.  In this way they will get an 
idea of proportions which they feel are suitable.  The details 
and the style is somewhat secondary and is left to the 
architect's taste.  
     5.  The ten year period of the Crusade is running along 
very rapidly; and the Guardian therefore hopes that your 
Assembly will present him with your final views in 
connection with the Temple design at a very early date; 
otherwise he is fearful this most important project will not 
be consummated within the Ten Year period.  
     The beloved Guardian was very sorry to learn of the 
illness of Dr. &Muhlschlegel.  He wishes to assure you and 
likewise to assure Dr. &Muhlschlegel of his loving prayers for 
Dr. &Muhlschlegel's complete recovery.  He values Dr. 
&Muhlschlegel's services very highly, and he hopes he will 
soon be able to again become most active in the &Baha'i 
work....  
     The Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf.  
He sends each his loving Greetings.  
 
+P247 
November 1955+F1 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has instructed me to write you in 
connection with your recent letter to him concerning the 
Temple to be built in Germany.  
     The beloved Master has not given very many details 
concerning the House of Worship.  He has written in tablets, 
however, that the building must be round, and be 9-sided.  
The Guardian feels that at this time all &Baha'i temples 
should have a dome.  In other words, the instructions of the 
Master to have a round, 9-sided building must be very 
carefully carried out; but in addition the Guardian feels the 
Temples built now should likewise have a dome.  
     The Guardian sees no objections to asking other 
architects to collaborate with the architect of the design 
"Azamat".  However it should be understood that the 
Guardian does not wish this collaboration or adaptation to 
result in the ultra-modern type of building which is the 
motif of the submissions which have been made, and which 
he has rejected.  
     The Guardian advises that the 2 designs which are 
favored by your Assembly and the architects of Germany 
are not acceptable; and therefore correspondence with 
regard to these designs is no longer necessary.  
     Time moves on, and the Guardian therefore hopes that 
the result of the collaboration and adaptation of the Azamat 
design will be presented to him in the near future.  
     The Guardian has no objections of course to new designs 
being presented; but they must carry with them the dignified 
spirit of the Faith, and must be in keeping with the 
 
+F1 Letter without date, was received 23rd November 1955.  
 
+P248 
distinction and honor which comes to the temples now 
being built being the first in their respective continents.  
     My letter of November 10th outlines in a little more 
detail what the Guardian has in mind for &Baha'i temples; 
and he hopes that something suitable may soon be found for 
a temple in Germany.  
     The Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf, 
and sends you his loving greetings....  
 
 
23 November 1955 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has received your letter of 
November 8th, reviewing further the question of the &Baha'i 
Temple in Germany.  
     Your letter crossed my communication to you of last 
week.  The Guardian has asked me to write you further, 
making the following points:  
     1.  He does not approve of either design No. 11335 or 
Cupola.  
     2.  As I have written you previously, he feels that the only 
submission which has come to him which lends itself to 
adjustment for the Temple in Germany is the design 
"Azamat".  
     3.  As outlined in my letter of last week, the Guardian 
does not object to your arranging for another architect to 
collaborate with Mr. Hopfner.  However in this 
collaboration, the general design of the Temple "Azamat" 
should be continued; and under no circumstances should it 
be changed to resemble the ultra modern architectural type 
of building which was the motif of the other submissions.  
 
+P249 
     4.  As the Guardian has indicated, previously, this 
building need have seating capacity of only 500 or 600 
people.  
     5.  It should be a more modest structure, as has been 
outlined in previous correspondence.  The Guardian feels 
the height should be not over 30 meters, and the other 
proportions of the building should be cut down accordingly.  
     6.  The Guardian feels the cost should run about 
$300,000 or a little more; certainly on the outside not more 
than $400,000.  
     Therefore in revising the plan, it should be simplified in 
such a way as to bring the cost down,--to a figure near 
$300,000.  
     It is noted in the details of the "Azamat" there are a 
number of things still included, which certainly could be 
gotten along without, for the time being.  
     With the elimination of the Assembly Hall in the 
basement, the elimination of the tea kitchen and dining 
room, as well as conference rooms, library, archives and the 
other rooms contemplated, this should make a rather 
material reduction in expense.  Likewise the caretaker's 
quarters should be eliminated, as the caretaker could 
probably live in the basement for the time being.  Elevators 
need not be considered.  
     The basement floor of the Temple in Chicago is cement; 
and it would seem if cement is suitable for that Temple, it 
would be satisfactory for the Temple in Germany.  
     Three years of the Crusade are practically over.  The 
Guardian hopes therefore that he will receive at an early 
date the revision which is proposed of the "Azamat" design, 
which should not be materially changed, but may be 
simplified so that work may proceed at an early date on the 
construction.  The Guardian is fearful if this matter 
 
+P250 
continues to drag, the Temple may not be completed during 
the period of the Ten Year Crusade.  
     The Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf, 
and sends you his loving greetings....  
 
 
15 December 1955 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has instructed me to write you in 
connection with the purchase of two endowments for the 
National Spiritual Assembly of Germany and Austria.  
     As you know, the Hand of the Cause, Mrs. Amelia E. 
Collins, has contributed one thousand dollars for the 
purchase of each of these endowments.  
     The Guardian feels that 2 small pieces of land costing 
about one thousand American Dollars each is sufficient to 
accomplish these two goals of the Ten Year Crusade.  He 
hopes therefore your Assembly will proceed at once to 
purchase a small piece of land in Germany and also one in 
Austria.  
     Will you please let me know in due course what your 
Assembly will do to accomplish this most important 
task?...  
 
 
15 December 1955 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     ...The Guardian is quite anxious that the question of the 
Temple land and the Temple design be concluded at a very 
early date, as time is passing very rapidly.  He has asked me 
to meet with your Assembly, if the Assembly does meet 
 
+P251 
during my visit in Europe, or can meet.  I could arrange to be 
in Germany early in January....  
 
 
20 December 1955 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your loving letter of December 8th was received and 
immediately presented to our Beloved Guardian:  
     He directed me to cable you yesterday, which I did, as 
follows:  
 
          "Guardian approves your asking other National 
     Assemblies write Court.  Suggests you write them direct 
     giving full particulars.  Does not feel exhibit appropriate 
     until final Temple design approved.  Writing."  
 
     The Guardian fully approved of your asking the various 
National Assemblies to write the Court, with regard to the 
World Importance of the Temple.  He felt you should write 
them direct, giving them full particulars as to what you wish 
in the letters, to whom to be addressed, and any other 
pertinent data required.  He hopes this will be helpful in 
working out this important matter.  
     The Guardian felt it would be inadvisable to have an 
exhibit of proposals for the Temple, until such time as the 
final plan is approved.  Thus you should hold the exhibit in 
abeyance until later.  I am having sent you by separate mail, 
the designs, photographs, etc. which you sent to the 
Guardian.  
     The Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf, 
and sends you his loving Greetings....  
 
+P252 
3 February 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     The Beloved Guardian has directed me to write to your 
Assembly explaining his view that now that the National 
&Hazira has been established and is well able to take care of 
the national office of the National Assembly; that the office 
of the Secretary of the National Assembly should be 
established there as soon as convenient.  
     From the &Hazira, all the national administrative activities 
should emanate, and this cannot be done unless the 
National Secretary's office is established there.  He requests 
your Assembly study the matter and see if it cannot soon 
work out some plan whereby the National Secretary's office 
can permanently be established in Frankfurt in the National 
&Hazira.  
     The Guardian assures the members of the Assembly of 
his prayers in their behalf.  He sends you his loving 
Greetings....  
 
 
20 March 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     Thank you for your loving letter of March 10th, with 
regard to the translations into Russian.  
     I hope the pamphlet which Mrs. Sommerau has prepared 
will soon be published, so that there will be literature 
available for this teaching work.  
     The Guardian is extremely anxious of course for proper 
contacts to be made with the believers behind the Iron 
Curtain.  However the utmost circumspection must be used; 
and certainly no one must enter into correspondence with 
 
+P253 
them.  I think you should inform ... that the Guardian is 
anxious for the closest contacts to be opened and 
maintained, but not through correspondence.  Likewise 
when any &Baha'i goes behind the Iron Curtain and contacts 
the believers, it must be done very quietly and carefully.  
     Do I understand from the letter that ... is intending to 
enter behind the Iron Curtain to visit the believers?  This 
would be commendable if it can be done....  
 
 
23 March 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian was happy to receive your message 
of greeting dated February 19th, signed by all those present, 
and to see that it was possible for such a large number of the 
friends to attend this gathering.  
     He hopes that this year, Number 113, the Year of &Abha 
of the sixth &Vahid in the &Baha'i calendar, will prove to be a 
truly "Most Luminous" one; and that, in spite of the ever-present 
difficulties which must constantly be met and 
surmounted, your National Assembly, reinforced in all its 
efforts by the entire body of the believers, may cause the 
Faith to forge ahead in those regions with yet greater 
momentum and power.  
     He will remember you all in his loving prayers....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty bless your efforts, guide every step you 
take, remove all obstacles from your path, and aid you to 
win great victories in the service of His glorious Faith, 
                                        Your true brother, 
                                                  Shoghi 
 
+P254 
25 March 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Referring to your loving letter of March 19th with regard 
to the designs for the Temple in Frankfurt:  
     The designs of the second competition were duly received 
by the beloved Guardian.  He is now giving them very active 
consideration.  As soon as some decision is reached, I will be 
glad to communicate with you at once.  
     The members of the International Council greatly 
appreciate your warm &Naw-Ruz greetings, which they 
reciprocate most heartily.  We will pray at the Shrines that 
every success will attend your efforts; and that the most 
important subject of the Temple grounds and Temple land 
will be satisfactorily settled in the very near future....  
 
 
6 April 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Enclosed is the beloved Guardian's message to all &Baha'i 
Conventions.  He would like you to please share it with the 
delegates and friends attending your National Convention.  
     He hopes it will stimulate the teaching work, and 
particularly the pioneer work....  
 
 
7 April 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     Your loving letter of March 28th was duly received, 
carrying with it the strong spirit which animates the friends 
in Germany.  
 
+P255 
     The answers to the questions which you raised in your 
letter are as follows:  
     The Guardian advises that he will leave to your 
discretion, just how the $1,000 which is available in 
America is to be used, in connection with the Endowment.  
In other words, you may purchase another piece of land for 
the $1,000; may apply it to repair of existing holdings, 
other than the &Hazira, such as the House in Esslingen--or 
put it in the Temple Fund.  
     1.  The goals of the Ten Year Crusade include the 
purchase of an endowment for Germany.  By referring to 
page 72 of the British Statistical Book, issued at the 
beginning of the Ten Year Crusade, you will note, that 
Germany is listed as requiring an endowment.  I think the 
Assembly should correspond with the American National 
Spiritual Assembly, so that the One Thousand Dollars 
which Mrs. Collins has made available may be sent to you.  
     2.  The beloved Guardian advises that he has ... on his list 
of those who wish to make the pilgrimage.  As soon as it is 
possible for them to come, he will inform them.  You might 
explain to these dear friends that there are a great many 
Persian &Baha'is who wish to make the pilgrimage; and the 
Guardian feels he must invite them on the basis of the date 
of their application.  In other words, those who asked for 
permission first would be the first to be invited to make the 
pilgrimage.  
     3.  I did not present to the Guardian the question of new 
&Baha'is in Greece being allowed to remain in their church 
after they become &Baha'is, because I knew there was no such 
situation existing.  The Guardian does not wish to be asked 
to make rulings on situations which might develop.  He has 
already enunciated very clearly the principle that when 
people become &Baha'is, they should, if not immediately, 
 
+P256 
then within a short time, leave the church.  If there is any 
exception to be made to these rules, it would be on specific 
instances, and on specific application of a national 
assembly.  
     When the pioneers in Greece have any individuals ready 
to become &Baha'is, and then if the church question is a 
deterring factor, perhaps at that time your Assembly will 
wish to take the matter up with the Guardian.  I am sure he 
would not want to issue a ruling on a possible future case.  
     If this handling is not satisfactory to your Assembly, and 
you wish me to present the matter to the Guardian, in that 
event let me know and I will do so.  
     4.  I hope some arrangement is worked out to handle the 
publication of Russian literature.  It will be of advantage at 
this time for local teaching and therefore what can--should 
certainly be prepared.  I did inform Mrs. Sommerau that I 
would see that her pamphlet was financed, and I have had 
some correspondence with her and Marion Little 
concerning the matter.  As developments occur, I will be 
glad to let you know....  
     The Guardian sends his loving Greetings to the members 
of the N.S.A.  
 
 
27 April 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The Beloved Guardian has been giving very serious 
consideration to the model for the Temple to be built in 
Frankfurt.  
     He feels that the design No. 102-A, prepared by Architect 
Teuto Rocholl, is susceptible of development into the type 
of building which we wish.  
 
+P257 
     The Guardian asks that you consult with the architect, 
asking him to submit a few modifications of the plan, 
simply in a rough pencil sketch, incorporating the following 
adjustments:  
     1.  A third story should be provided without of course 
increasing the size of the building.  
     2.  The building must be 9-sided instead of round.  
     3.  A lantern should be placed on the top of the dome.  
     4.  The dome should be more gracefully shaped, with a 
little more peak to the top.  
     5.  It might be that some windows could be placed at the 
base of the dome, so as to give the impression of a 
clerestory.  
     The architect himself may have some other modifications 
that may occur to him as he sets up plans.  
     If you could have this matter handled as quickly as 
possible, the Guardian would be very appreciative.  Time is 
running along very rapidly, and if an early start is not made 
on the building, it may be difficult to finish it during the Ten 
Year Plan.  
     The Guardian sends you his loving greetings....  
 
 
19 May 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     Referring to your letter of May 5th, with regard to the 
model of the Temple.  I cabled you May 14th, that the 
Guardian had not approved any design for the Temple.  He 
simply felt that there was possibility of the design of 
Architect Rocholl, No. 102-A being developed into a 
suitable design.  He has not been satisfied with the 
submissions, but when the revisions are sent by Mr. 
 
+P258 
Rocholl, he will then reappraise all of them to see if any can 
be given further consideration.  
     Please refer to my letter of November 23, 1955, item 6, in 
which it is stated the Guardian felt "the cost should run 
about $300,000 or a little more; certainly on the outside, 
not more than $400,000."  The Guardian has directed me 
to advise you, that he now feels the maximum which should 
be spent on the construction, is $300,000 and no more....  
 
 
19 May 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your loving letter of May 13th, has come to hand, and I 
am hastening to answer, particularly that portion dealing 
with the translations in Russian:  
     Mrs. ... was raised in Russia; at least in the early part of 
her life.  She fled with others during the Revolution.  Thus 
her knowledge of Russian should be excellent.  
     She has recently become a &Baha'i, in Lausanne.  
     In Lausanne, another woman has become a &Baha'i, who is 
Russian, and is an excellent linguist.  I understand in any 
translating now being done, she is being consulted.  
     It is my thought that your Assembly should correspond 
with the Italo Swiss NSA, so as to set up some method of 
handling Russian translations and printing.  As you know, 
..., in Geneva, is Russian, and likewise a good translator.  If 
your two NSA's set up a General Translating Committee, I 
am sure great results would be achieved.  
     I am sending Mrs. ..., some views of the Shrines and 
Gardens, which I hope will give her happiness....  
 
+P259 
19 May 1956 
 
Dear Friends:  
     The Beloved Guardian has directed me to write you 
concerning the court case relating to the Temple Land near 
Eschborn.  
     You have asked if the decision of the Court should be 
adverse, if you should appeal the case to a higher court.  
     The Guardian feels that if the decision of the Court is 
adverse, then you should not appeal the case, but should at 
once look for another site for the Temple.  
     Time is rapidly passing, and no further time should be 
lost in trying the case.  You should find another piece of 
land, so work on the Temple may start.  The Guardian is 
fearful, if there are further delays, either in the question of 
land, or the question of Model, the time will have so flown, 
that the Temple in Germany will not be built during the Ten 
Year Crusade.  
     He assures you of his prayers in your behalf, and sends his 
loving Greetings to all the members of the Assembly....  
 
 
5 June 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter of April 19th has been received by the beloved 
Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his 
behalf.  
     He is very happy that Vienna now has its own &Haziratu'l-Quds, 
which will become the National Headquarters of the 
Austrian National Spiritual Assembly when formed.  
     This important step forward is bound to reflect itself in 
the teaching work, and attract many new souls to the Faith.  
 
+P260 
     The establishment of the other Centers in Austria during 
the past year has been most encouraging, and he hopes that 
by Spring of next year there will be a number of flourishing 
Spiritual Assemblies.  
     He will pray for you all and for the success of the work in 
Vienna....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty, Whose Cause you serve so devotedly, 
reward you abundantly for your labours, remove all 
obstacles from your path, and enable you to win great 
victories in the days to come, 
                                    Your true brother,

Dear &Baha'i Co-workers:  
     The Beloved Guardian has directed me to write you, in 
response to your recent letter to him, with regard to the 
modified Temple plans of Mr. Rocholl.  
     As he understands the situation, your NSA is not pleased 
with the modified plans, and Mr. Rocholl says he will 
submit one or two others.  The Guardian will await receipt 
of these further modifications, if it does not delay the matter 
too long.  
     So far as a modification of Mr. Grund, he feels it would 
delay the project too long to wait for new plans from him; 
unless of course, he has them ready for sending now.  
     In other words, the Guardian will await for a reasonable 
time, the receipt of further plans of Mr. Rocholl, before 
making final decision; and if by that time, any modifications 
have come from Mr. Grund, he will consider them; but he 
 
+P261 
does not feel we can wait now, for an entire new 
development by Mr. Grund, unless he has it under way....  
 
 
8 June 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Co-workers:  
     The Beloved Guardian, as you know, is very anxious to 
have the matter of the land for the Temple near Frankfurt 
decided as quickly as possible, and he is hoping the decision 
of the court will be favorably announced in the near future.  
     Will you please cable me, just as soon as a decision is 
given, just what it is, so I may hand it to the Guardian at 
once....  
 
 
21 June 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letters of August 8 and 18, September 9, October 4, 
November 8, 9 and 13, one undated, received December 
18, 1955; and January 27, one dated January, February 7, 
24 and 28, April 21, May 5, and 31, with enclosures, and 
also material sent under separate cover have all been 
received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me 
to answer you on his behalf.  
     He has been very encouraged during the last year over the 
increased activity on the part of the German &Baha'is, as 
witnessed by the teaching conferences they have held at 
different times and in different places; and the growth of 
new Centers in Austria more or less as a direct outcome of 
the devoted pioneer efforts of members of the German 
&Baha'i Community.  This fulfills a long-cherished wish of 
 
+P262 
his, and was a source of great satisfaction.  He hopes that the 
Groups in Graz, Innsbruck and Salzburg will attain 
Assembly status by next &Ridvan, thus giving the Austrian 
Community a much firmer foundation and preparing it for 
the day when it will have its independent National 
Assembly, a day which is not so very far off after all, and 
towards which they must work constantly, with ever 
increasing zeal and dedication.  
     He was also very happy to hear that the Vienna 
Community has settled down in its &Haziratu'l-Quds, its 
future national headquarters building; and that this is not 
only a center for the &Baha'is, but, what is even more 
important, a center for their teaching activities on a larger 
and more impressive scale in that city.  
     As he already informed you before, he felt that the 
generous contribution of dear Mrs. Collins towards the 
purchase of a national endowment for Austria should be 
used for that purpose only, and not diverted to anything to 
do with the furnishing or embellishing of the &Haziratu'l-Quds.  
     He hopes that the presence of a devoted American &Baha'i, 
Mrs. Edna Johnson Norvell in Austria will be of help to the 
friends.  She is most eager to serve and assist them in every 
way she can.  
     It has been recently a great pleasure for the Guardian to 
receive here as his guests four of the pioneers to Athens.  
This contact has been most welcome, and he feels that your 
Assembly can be proud of these fine young people, who are 
making every effort to achieve the goals set for the German 
&Baha'is in Greece.  
     He has also had the great pleasure of receiving here the 
first German &Baha'i since before the war; namely, Miss 
Weber, one of the pioneers to Crete.  
 
+P263 
     He hopes that the German &Baha'i Community will make 
every effort to send forth a greater number of pioneers to the 
countries which have been made their particular 
responsibility under the World Crusade, and also to 
reinforce the work in Austria.  They must never forget that 
one of the first "pioneers", before the days when that term 
was even in use, was dear Mr. Benke, who sacrificed his life 
in the service of the Faith with such an exemplary spirit of 
devotion that the Guardian felt impelled to call him the first 
European martyr for the Faith.  This was a great distinction 
and blessing conferred on the German &Baha'is, and should 
stimulate many others to follow in his footsteps.  
     The Guardian is very sorry that there has been so much 
delay as regards the Temple in Frankfurt, both because of 
the difficulty of obtaining permission to build on the site 
chosen, and the difficulty in coming to a decision about the 
design.  
     He feels that, as this is the Mother Temple of Europe, and 
an institution which will be supported by contributions 
from &Baha'is all over the world, that it has a very great 
importance; and must under all circumstances be dignified, 
and not represent an extremist point of view in architecture.  
No one knows how the styles of the present day may be 
judged two or three generations from now; but the &Baha'is 
cannot afford to build a second Temple if the one that they 
built at the present time should seem too extreme and 
unsuitable at a future date.  
     In view of this, he has pondered very carefully over the 
designs which were submitted to him, and also consulted 
Mr. Remey.  He hopes to come to a decision, and will 
inform your Assembly accordingly.  
     He appreciated very much the cooperative spirit shown 
by many of the German architects and their offer to come 
 
+P264 
here and consult with him.  This would have been 
impractical, and a waste of the money of the Faith; but, if 
your Assembly has occasion, he would like it to please 
thank these gentlemen for their friendly and cooperative 
spirit as regards our Temple.  
     He feels that the National &Haziratu'l-Quds in Frankfurt 
should act as the Secretariat of the National Assembly as 
well.  This is the main reason why the &Baha'is have National 
Headquarters--so that the office of the National Spiritual 
Assembly can operate from the National Assembly's 
permanent address.  It may not be convenient at times, but it 
is essential that this should be done.  He has informed other 
national bodies of the same thing, that is, those who had not 
already placed their Secretariat in their &Haziratu'l-Quds.  
     He feels that your Assembly should particularly 
concentrate at this time on accelerating the work on the 
home front.  Perhaps the most difficult objective for any of 
the National Assemblies to accomplish is the one of 
increasing the number of Assemblies and Centers under 
their jurisdiction before the end of the Ten Year Plan.  The 
friends must realize that this, by its very nature, is a task 
which it is dangerous to postpone to the latter years of the 
Plan.  The construction of Assemblies is always a laborious 
process, and one which demands a great deal of preparation 
and forethought and time to achieve.  Therefore, the sooner 
the believers go out into the field, and assist, through 
settlement or through extension teaching, or travelling 
teaching trips, or in whatever way they can, in laying the 
foundation for these new Assemblies, the better.  
     He hopes that the &Baha'i youth in Germany will be 
encouraged to take a more active part in administrative 
affairs and in the teaching work.  They must always realize 
that they are the future of the Cause, and they should gain 
 
+P265 
from experience as teachers and administrators from the 
older friends, in preparation for the time when the burden 
of the work will fall on their shoulders.  
     The news of the publication work you have in hand was 
also encouraging; and he hopes that, when you receive your 
Reparations from the proper civil authorities there, you will 
be able to put the new &Baha'i Publishing Trust on a firm 
foundation, and get out more literature, which is the very 
backbone of the teaching work.  
     You may be sure that he often remembers you in his 
prayers in the holy Shrines; and he deeply appreciates the 
consecrated spirit with which you are serving the interests of 
the Faith in Germany and Austria, and in the virgin 
territories allotted to your care.  He hopes that the national 
work can be arranged in such a way that too great a burden 
does not fall on the Hands of the Cause, who already have 
another important function to discharge, and yet who are 
needed because of their capacities for the National 
Assembly work as well.  
     He was very sorry to hear of the illness of some of the 
members who are so needed in the teaching work in 
Germany, and he hopes and prays that they are now fully 
recovered.  
     The good news that your National Convention was held 
so successfully pleased him very much; and he was also 
happy to see that a young and comparatively new &Baha'i has 
been added to your Body.  This will no doubt be of 
assistance to the work of the Assembly.  
     He was also happy to see that you have been able to add 
another incorporation, in such an important city as 
Frankfurt, the national seat....  
 
+P266 
P.S.  Mr. Ioas recently wrote your Assembly that the 
Guardian does not feel it would serve any useful purpose to 
reconsider Temple designs with Prof. Grund; please thank 
him for his helpfulness and fine spirit.  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     The progress achieved in recent years, and particularly 
since the inception of the Ten-Year Plan, by both the 
German and Austrian &Baha'i communities, in the field of 
teaching and administrative spheres of &Baha'i activity, has 
been such as to evoke feelings of deep and abiding gratitude 
in my heart, and to excite the admiration of their sister 
communities in both the East and the West.  
     Emerging more than a decade ago, from a prolonged 
period of adversity, which served to purge, discipline and 
spiritually quicken the nations to which these communities 
belong; abundantly demonstrating, throughout the 
afflictive trial they underwent, the sterling qualities of their 
faith and the depth of their unalterable devotion to the 
Cause they have espoused; firmly reestablishing, on the 
morrow of that ordeal, the institutions of an Administrative 
Order which had been temporarily disrupted and suffered 
an eclipse during the years of repression, suffering and 
confusion; embarking, at a later period, and in concert with 
&Baha'i communities the world over, on the Ten-Year Plan, 
designed to carry them a stage further on the road leading 
them to their high destiny--the members of these 
communities are now, both individually and collectively, 
fully engaged in the discharge of their sacred and heavy 
responsibilities--responsibilities which they cannot shirk 
and which I feel confident, they will nobly and fully 
discharge.  
 
+P267 
     The third phase of the Plan which they now have entered 
must witness such an acceleration in the tempo of &Baha'i 
activity, in the various fields assigned to them, and such a 
depth of consecration to the tasks they have shouldered, as 
shall throw into shade every evidence of the valour 
displayed during the infancy of the Faith in both of these 
countries.  
     The virgin territories alloted to your assembly, under the 
Ten-Year Plan, must be carefully watched over, and the 
prizes won in those fields must be constantly enriched, at 
whatever cost, through the dispatch of a larger number of 
pioneers and a more adequate provision for the needs, both 
material and spiritual, of those valiant souls who, by the 
very nature of their services, constitute the vanguard of the 
future army of &Baha'u'llah which must, in the days to come 
be raised up in those territories.  The homefront, the 
reservoir which must be constantly replenished if the aid 
given to these pioneers is to prove ultimately adequate and 
effective, must be made the object of the solicitude and of 
the anxious deliberations of the members of your Assembly.  
The remarkable success recently achieved, through the 
multiplication of &Baha'i assemblies, groups and isolated 
centres, must be followed up by a corresponding increase in 
the number of the avowed and active supporters of the Faith
--the bedrock on which the strength and stability of the 
entire community must rest.  The preliminary stages 
designed to launch the greatest enterprise confronting the 
German &Baha'i Community--the construction of the 
Mother Temple of Europe--must be swiftly and 
energetically undertaken, particularly in connexion with the 
ultimate settlement of the issue of the Temple site, and the 
provision of the necessary authorization for the laying of its 
foundations and the erection of its structure.  
 
+P268 
     Another matter of vital importance, and destined to exert 
a lasting influence on the immediate destinies of the German 
&Baha'i Community, is the adoption of the necessary 
measures for the introduction of the Faith into neighbouring 
territories, such as the translation of &Baha'i literature into 
Russian and into the languages in use in the Baltic states, 
and the exploration of every avenue designed to enable 
German &Baha'i pioneers to launch this vast, this historic and 
meritorious campaign beyond the eastern confines of their 
native land.  
     The process of incorporating firmly established &Baha'i 
local assemblies, which has so far been regrettably slow, 
must be further stimulated, in order to consolidate the legal 
foundations of the administrative structure of the Faith in 
that land as well as in Austria.  
     The institution of the National Fund, whose fundamental 
importance cannot be exaggerated, must receive a wider 
and fuller measure of support from the rank and file of the 
believers, in order that it may be enabled to provide more 
adequately than heretofore for the pressing material needs 
of the infant institutions of the Faith, now faced with such 
tremendous and inescapable responsibilities.  
     Particular attention must, moreover, be devoted to the 
vital and urgent needs of the Faith in Austria, where a 
nascent community is heroically struggling to establish its 
independent national &Baha'i existence on a secure 
foundation.  
     Constant encouragement, by whatever means possible, 
must, furthermore, be given the suppressed and isolated 
local communities in Eastern Germany, now so sadly 
detached from the general body of the followers of the Faith 
in that land, and any assistance, lying in your power, must 
 
+P269 
be extended to them for the purpose of enabling some of 
their members to penetrate into the remaining territories 
assigned to your assembly under the provisions of the Ten-Year 
Plan.  
     The stalwart German &Baha'i Community, ranking among 
the oldest and certainly one of the most eminent, 
communities in Europe; firmly implanted in the heart of 
that continent; constituting one of the leading strongholds 
of the Faith within its confines; reassured, time and again, 
through the glowing promises given it, in unmistakable 
language, by the Centre of the Covenant, in the early years 
of that community's existence; blessed so abundantly 
through His memorable visit to its homeland; hardened and 
chastened in the school of adversity; emerging triumphant 
over those adversaries that sought so ineffectively to arrest 
its march, dim its hopes, and disrupt its foundations; fully 
equipped through more than three decades of &Baha'i 
administrative experience--such a community finds itself, 
at this historic hour, fully and hopefully launched upon an 
enterprise which, if successfully carried out, will enable it to 
bring to a conclusion a chapter of the utmost significance in 
the evolution of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah in that land.  
     Aware of its manifold responsibilities, determined to 
fulfill the dearest hopes cherished for it by &Abdu'l-Baha, 
conscious of its inherent strength, and encouraged by its 
multiple and heartwarming accomplishments, this 
community, in conjunction with its younger sister, must 
redouble its efforts to scale loftier heights, to plumb greater 
depths of dedication, to evince a still nobler heroism, and to 
heighten, by its accomplishments, and, above all, by a still 
more convincing demonstration of the spirit animating its 
members, the feelings of admiration which I myself, as well 
as the believers in other lands, hold them, in consequence of 
 
+P270 
their mighty endeavours and unforgettable exploits in the 
service, and for the Cause, of &Baha'u'llah.  
     May His Spirit ever shine upon, and warm, their hearts.  
May His precepts ever guide their footsteps, and may His 
unfailing grace, vouchsafed from the realms on high, be 
poured forth upon them in such abundance as to enable 
them to achieve, in the years immediately ahead, total and 
complete victory.  
                                    Your true brother, 
                                              Shoghi 
 
 
7 July 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Under separate cover, I am sending you the latest design 
of Mr. Teuto Rocholl, which has been carefully reviewed by 
the Beloved Guardian.  
     Also enclosed in the same package is a design for the 
German Temple, prepared by Mr. Charles Remey, which 
likewise has been very carefully reviewed by the Guardian.  
     The Guardian feels that the German National Assembly 
may now make their selection from either of these two, of 
the design for the German Temple.  He says you are free to 
chose either Mr. Rocholl's or Mr. Remey's design.  
     In making your selection, you must of course, bear in 
mind the cost factor; that the building should not cost more 
than $300,000.  
     As soon as you have made your decision, will you please 
cable me so I can inform the Guardian.  
     The Guardian assures you of his prayers--and sends his 
loving Greetings....  
 
+P271 
7 July 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The Guardian has directed me to advise you that he 
appreciates your having established the Assistant Secretary 
of the NSA in the &Hazira in Frankfurt.  The Guardian wishes 
you to bear this important matter in mind, for in time, the 
full Secretariat must be established in the &Hazira....  
 
 
7 July 1956 
 
Mrs. Anna Grossmann:  
     The June 1956 issue of "Pflanze und Garten" issued in 
Darmstadt, Nicolaiweg 9, has an article on the Faith, and a 
number of photographs of the Gardens and Shrine of the 
&Bab, as well as the Mansion at &Bahji.  
     If you have not already seen it, you will wish to secure 
copies.  At the same time, will you please send me for use 
here, 6 copies.  It is not necessary to send the entire magazine 
for all six, simply the pages dealing with the Article.  Two 
magazines will suffice, the other four to be the pages 
only....  
 
 
8 July 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     Referring to my letter of yesterday, with regard to the 
design for the German Temple.  
     My letter should have specified, that the latest revised 
plan of Mr. Rocholl, No. 102-F is the one which should be 
considered for selection, and no former plans of Mr. 
 
+P272 
Rocholl.  In other words, the choice is left to the NSA of 
Germany, as to whether they select Mr. Rocholl's design 
No. 102-F, or Mr. Remey's design....  
 
 
27 July 1956 
 
Dearly Beloved Co-workers:  
     I telegraphed you today, at the direction of the beloved 
Guardian, the wish that your Assembly, now concentrate 
closely, on the securing of the new site for the Temple.  
     Now that you have determined on the design for the 
Temple, it is most important that you secure the land on 
which it is to be built.  
     The Guardian feels this is a task of the utmost 
importance, as time is rapidly passing on, and he fears that 
if the work on the Temple is not started soon, it will not be 
completed during the Ten Year Crusade, which would be a 
sad state of affairs.  
     The Guardian will be happy to learn at an early date, of 
what progress you have made with regard to the location of 
the Temple....  
 
 
31 July 1956 
 
Dearly Beloved Friends:  
     The Beloved Guardian has directed me to write you in 
connection with the Temple design for Germany, and the 
activities in connection therewith.  
     1.  The Guardian feels your Assembly should not 
announce the selection at this time, to the Friends.  You 
should, quietly, review the matter carefully, and ascertain 
 
+P273 
what the cost of construction will be.  It may be if the 
expense is out of line with the amounts available, then some 
other considerations will have to be given.  
     2.  You should concentrate all your energies on the 
securing of the Temple location.  This is important, as the 
Temple cannot of course be started, until the land is 
purchased.  
     3.  When you have the arrangements made for the land 
purchase, and have the costs of the Temple construction, let 
the Guardian know, and he will advise the next step.  
     4.  The Guardian will announce the selection of the 
Temple design to the &Baha'i World, after all these matters 
are settled.  
     The Guardian hopes you will be able to expedite all these 
matters, as he feels, as I have written previously, there is no 
time to be lost, if the Temple is to be completed before the 
close of the Ten Year Crusade.  
     The Guardian sends you his loving greetings....  
 
 
26 August 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     Your loving letter of July 17th was duly received, and its 
contents presented to the Beloved Guardian.  
     For the Endowment in Austria, no more than $1,000. 
should be spent.  I cabled you with regard to the gift of Mr. 
... NSA, and if so, his contribution cannot be accepted. 
full name.  This information is necessary as he may be an 
individual whose voting rights were withdrawn by the 
... NSA, and if so, his contribution cannot be accepted.  
As soon as I have his first name and initials, I will be able to 
tell, and will then let you know definitely.  
 
+P274 
     Your report for the year 112 in English has been sent on 
to the Guardian, for his study and perusal....  
 
 
24 September 1956 (Summer School) 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has received your letter of August 
17th, signed by those present at the Summer School, and 
has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He was happy to see that the Hands of the Cause were 
represented there, also that &Baha'is from different countries 
were present.  
     The friends can gain much spiritual reinforcement by 
drawing on the inner strength of their &fellow-Baha'is; and 
the Guardian hopes those who went to Esslingen this 
summer received this renewed power from mingling with 
other &Baha'is; and returned to their homes more determined 
than ever to carry forward in the speediest and most 
efficient manner possible--the work of the World Spiritual 
Crusade.  
     He appreciates the prayers of the friends, and sends you 
all his loving greetings....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Spirit of &Baha'u'llah sustain you in your splendid 
activities, aid you to acquire a fuller grasp of the 
fundamental and distinguishing features and teachings of 
our beloved Faith, and lend a great impetus to its onward 
march, 
                                    Your true brother, 
                                              Shoghi

27 September 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The Beloved Guardian has directed me to write you to 
ascertain the present status of the purchase of the new site 
for the Temple in Frankfurt.  
     As you know he attaches the utmost importance to this 
matter, and regrets that it has not been consummated up to 
the present time.  He is becoming fearful that the Temple 
will not be built in Germany, during the Ten Year Crusade, 
unless there is some strong immediate action taken in 
connection with the purchase of the land, and then the 
prosecution of the construction work.  
     Will your Assembly please let me know by return airmail, 
what the status is of the land purchase....  
 
 
27 September 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     Please refer to your letter of July 17th and my reply of 
August 26th, with regard to a gift of $1,000 from ... to the 
Austrian Fund.  
     It is satisfactory to receive this gift, as ... is a &Baha'i of 
record of the ... Assembly.  
     As I wrote you however, it cannot be used for the 
Endowment; as a gift of $1,000 has already been made by 
... for this purpose.  Thus ... should be informed, so he may 
direct in what manner he wishes the money used, or if he 
gives it for the General Fund, which is, of course, best....  
 
+P276 
27 September 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     The Beloved Guardian has directed me to write your 
Assembly, to ask the status of the purchase of the 
Endowment in Austria, which he hopes will be purchased 
shortly.  This should be a relatively simple matter, and he 
hopes it can be followed through promptly.  
     He likewise is anxious regarding the incorporation of 
local Assemblies.  He hopes your Assembly will review the 
matter further at this time, to see if more Assemblies cannot 
be incorporated at this time....  
 
 
28 September 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     The beloved Guardian has received your recent letter, and 
has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He was grieved to hear of the passing of Mr. Rahmatollah 
Saffar.  He deeply appreciates the services rendered the Faith 
by him, and wishes to extend his loving sympathy to his 
family, and to assure them of his prayers for the progress of 
his spirit.  
     The Guardian will shortly be sending Five Hundred 
Pounds for the German National Spiritual Assembly to help 
in the teaching work....  
 
 
6 October 1956 (First Austrian Summer School) 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your note of greeting dated August 29th, signed by all 
present on this important occasion, together with its 
 
+P277 
enclosures, has been received by the beloved Guardian, and 
he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  He was 
happy to see the names of so many participants, as such 
gatherings bring a fresh spirit and a renewed determination 
to carry forward the work to all the friends.  
     The Guardian assures you he will remember you in his 
loving prayers; and he urges you to steadily, courageously 
and whole-heartedly, pursue your goals under the historic 
World Spiritual Crusade, confident that this will attract to 
you the blessings of &Baha'u'llah....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty guide your steps in the path of service, 
remove all obstacles from your path, and enable you to 
extend the range of your meritorious services, and win great 
victories in the days to come, 
                                    Your true brother,

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your loving letter of October 3rd was presented to the 
Beloved Guardian.  
     The Guardian has directed me to assure your Assembly, 
that he is praying for the removal of every obstacle in the 
way of the purchase of the site for the Temple at Frankfurt.  
     He hopes you and your committee will continue to press 
the matter vigorously, as he hopes this important matter, 
can be successfully achieved in the near future.  
     When you have concluded the purchase, he would 
appreciate a cable from you.  
     He sends his loving greetings to each of you....

22 October 1956 (Teaching Conference) 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has received the letter which you 
all signed, dated September 30th, and has instructed me to 
answer you on his behalf.  
     When we stop to think that we are already in the fourth 
year of the World Spiritual Crusade, we realize that we 
cannot afford to look at our past accomplishments, but 
must face the future and the tremendous tasks which lie 
ahead.  
     He knows the attainment of the objectives of the Crusade 
is the concern deepest in the heart of each believer; and he is 
confident this Conference has sent forth those who attended 
with a renewed determination to do all in their power 
individually and collectively, as the days and weeks pass, to 
ensure its ultimate success....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty guide you in your constant endeavours 
for the spread of the Faith, and aid you to extend 
continually the scope of your valued activities, and lend, in 
the days to come, a great impetus to its progress and the 
consolidation of its institutions.  
                                    Your true brother, 
                                              Shoghi 
 
 
9 November 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The Beloved Guardian has directed me to respond to your 
recent letter to him, with regard to the Temple design, etc.  
     The Guardian likes the adjustments Mr. Rocholl has 
made in his design, and now approves of the drawings you 
 
+P279 
have sent him.  Therefore you should now proceed, within 
the following limitations.  
     No changes should be made further in the design.  If it is 
necessary to reduce the size in order to keep within the limit 
of financial resources, that is permissible, but no change in 
the size or proportions should be made.  
     As previously advised, the Guardian feels this Temple 
must be constructed at a cost of not to exceed $300,000.  
He is willing to consider raising this limit by $20,000, to 
cover furnishings, etc. or at the very outside $30,000.  
     Now it is necessary for your Assembly to study the 
matter, and decide how to proceed to construct the Temple 
within this money limit.  The Temple must be financed by 
the &Baha'is of the world, and with the heavy expenditures 
everywhere, economy must be exercised in all our 
undertakings, and limits of budgets set.  
     The important thing now is to build a House of Worship, 
which will bring untold spiritual blessings, wide publicity, 
and let us hope, a rapid increase in the number of &Baha'is 
and Centers.  
     As I have indicated, if it is necessary to decrease the size of 
the structure, that is satisfactory, but no change in design or 
proportions should be made to the main structure of the 
building.  
     This $320,000 figure, refers to the completed Temple, 
including fittings and equipment.  
     Of course, the Temple cannot be built until the land has 
been secured.  He requests and urges that your Assembly 
expedite this important matter in every way possible.  He is 
fearful, if work on the Temple is not started at an early date, 
it may be impossible to build the Temple in Germany during 
the Ten Year Crusade.  
 
+P280 
     He assures you of his prayers in your behalf.  He sends his 
loving Greetings....  
 
P.S.  The questions of materials to be used, he leaves to your 
Assembly.  You should endeavor to use such materials as are 
not too expensive, and yet satisfactory for the Temple.  
 
 
15 November 1956 
 
Dearly Beloved Sister:  
     The Beloved Guardian has directed me to write you 
concerning the purchase of the Endowment for Austria.  He 
hopes very much it will be possible for you to purchase this 
Endowment before &Ridvan 1957.  
     He asks that you write me, giving the status of this 
matter, and when you feel the purchase can be 
consummated....  
 
 
30 November 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     Your loving letters of November 19th and 22nd were 
duly received by the Beloved Guardian, and he has directed 
me to acknowledge them on his behalf.  
     He greatly appreciates, and was deeply touched, by your 
kind sentiments on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of 
his appointment as Guardian.  The spirit of devotion and 
consecration of the German Believers, and its National 
Assembly, augurs well for the future of the Faith in your 
country.  He is sure the Master will both guide and confirm 
 
+P281 
you in your work, as you carry forth the mandates of His 
Convenant, and the Teaching Tablets.  
     With regard to the Temple Land--The Guardian feels 
this must be purchased in Frankfurt, or its environs.  He 
does not approve of buying in Offenbach.  Thus he feels you 
can secure the land anywhere in Frankfurt or its environs, 
where it seems best suitable for our purposes.  
     The new location near Eschborn would seem satisfactory, 
but you must be sure there will be no trouble with permits to 
build.  
     He feels you should again review the entire matter most 
carefully, and he hopes you will soon find the location 
which will be the site of the House of Worship in Germany.  
     With regard to the funds--he feels it is best that you 
allow them to remain in the Bank as at present.  
     The Guardian sends you his loving greetings.  
     He is praying for you, and for the success of your work in 
the Faith....  
 
 
30 November 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     Your loving letter of October 17th was duly received, and 
its contents presented to the Beloved Guardian.  He has 
directed me to reply as follows:  
     He feels it is more advisable for ... to remain in Budapest, 
where the Faith needs every help it can get, rather than go to 
either Austria or Germany.  
     Of course, the terrible events in Hungary may have 
changed the whole aspect of this important matter, and the 
question not now be in need of an answer.  The Guardian 
 
+P282 
hopes that ... has not suffered nor met with misfortune in 
that unhappy city.  
     At the same time, the Faith is needed more than ever, and 
it may be the depressing conditions existing, may make it 
possible for more teaching work to be done....  
 
 
5 December 1956 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     The Beloved Guardian has directed me to write you 
concerning some copies of the prints which Mr. Rocholl has 
made of the Temple Design for Frankfurt.  
     He would like to secure 15 copies of the photo sent by 
Mr. Rocholl, which shows the Temple in White lines, and 
the background black.  
     The Temple itself, should be no larger than the Shrine in 
the Colored pictures of the Shrine of the &Bab.  Thus the 
measurement of the pictures to be sent are 21 cm by 13 cm.  
There need be little space below or over the Temple, but let 
the black run out to the edges, on both sides.  
     Do I make clear what the Guardian wants?  If you will 
show Mr. Rocholl a picture of the Shrine of the &Bab 
colored, as printed in America for sale, and which appears 
in the frontispiece of Vol. 9 of the &Baha'i World, he can 
have the pictures made accordingly.  
     The pictures should be black and white, glossy, and on as 
light paper as possible.  By light I mean, in weight.  
     Please cable me on receipt if this is clear, and if Mr. 
Rocholl can provide the 15 copies at an early date....  
 
+P283 
1 January 1957 
 
Mrs. Anna Grossmann:  
     Your loving letter of December 16th was duly received, 
and its contents presented to the Beloved Guardian.  
     Needless to say, he is very disturbed with the recent 
developments with regard to the Temple land and building.  
This matter has gone along for a long period of time, and he 
feels it is now reaching the point where it reflects on the 
Faith.  He feels very definitely that if there should be a failure 
in connection with the Temple to be built in Frankfurt, it 
would be a great set back to the Faith, not only in Germany, 
but in all Europe.  
     The Guardian suggests your Assembly read carefully, the 
many statements and letters to the American National 
Assembly, as to the importance of the Temple, and its 
construction.  He even says it will be the most important 
teacher of the Faith, and with its completion, a new spiritual 
movement will take place in America.  Whatever the Master 
has said with regard to the Temple in America, applies with 
equal force to Germany.  Surely we cannot allow the 
negative influences at work in Frankfurt and Germany, in 
connection with our Temple project, to stop our forward 
progress.  
     The Guardian would like your Assembly to consider the 
project of the Temple land, and the construction of the 
building, as its most important task, and give it precedence 
over all other problems.  
     So far as the question of Environs of Frankfurt is 
concerned, he will allow you to determine what constitutes 
the Environs of Frankfurt.  If you feel Offenbach, which is a 
separate city, is the environs of Frankfurt, he will approve 
 
+P284 
the construction there.  If the hills of Taunus constitute the 
environs, he will approve that location.  
     If the objection of the city of Frankfurt to the Temple 
model, is due to its size, why not reduce the size.  The 
important thing now is not the size of the building, but the 
fact of the building.  
     Therefore the Guardian will approve reduction in the 
size, so as to permit construction now, and in Frankfurt, or 
its environs.  
     The Guardian will pray for the guidance of your 
Assembly in working out this important project; that it may 
be settled promptly, and that soon we may rejoice, with the 
work of the Temple proceeding....

Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     I cabled you today, as follows:  
     "What is status purchase Temple Land Polischer Berg.  
Please cable."  
     I cabled you on January 8th that the Guardian approved 
purchase of the land of Polischer Berg, with the assurance 
that there would be no complications in connection with the 
erection of the Temple.  
     Your letter later spoke of the Temple Land near Kriftel, 
and I cabled to ascertain if this is the same land as referred 
to at Polischer Berg.  I take it, it is.  
     The Guardian now hopes all matters are clarified, and 
that your Assembly is in a position to purchase this land, 
and thus start the construction of the Temple.  Your early 
advice and confirmation will be appreciated by him....

Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     Miss Bertha Matthiessen, one of the dear &Baha'is of 
Southern California, who has spent some time in Germany, 
and is no doubt, well known to you; is returning to 
Germany from the United States in March 1957.  
     She has written the Guardian that after a rest at Bad 
Nauheim, she will get in touch with your Assembly, or the 
Teaching Committee, to assist in the teaching work.  The 
Guardian has written her, expressing his appreciation of 
this offer on her part to assist in the important work in 
Germany and Austria, and suggested that if she could settle 
in one of the goal cities in Austria, after consultation with 
your Assembly or Teaching Committee, it would be highly 
meritorious.  
     This note is sent to you, so you may understand, when 
she gets in touch with you this spring....  
 
 
24 Janaury 1957 (Winter School) 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your message dated January 5th has reached the beloved 
Guardian, and he was very happy to see that the friends had 
been able to meet and deepen their understanding of the 
Faith.  
     He hopes that the German &Baha'is, especially the Youth, 
will do all they can to consolidate the foundations of the 
work already so painstakingly laid in Germany during a 
period of almost half a century; and that each &Baha'i will 
consider it his privilege and duty to support the teaching 
work, either through pioneering to new Centers, or 
 
+P287 
strengthening weak Assemblies, or assisting the Groups to 
become Assemblies.  
     He assures you all of his loving prayers for your 
success....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty bless your efforts, guide and sustain 
you, and enable you to extend the scope of your valued 
activities, acquire a fuller understanding of the 
distinguishing features of His Faith, and lend an impetus to 
the progress and consolidation of its divinely appointed 
institutions, 
                                    Your true brother,

Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     Yesterday, a Jewish Seaman called, to present Greetings 
from Mrs. Santa Felbermann, connected with the British 
Legation in Budapest.  
     This gentlemen, who gave the name of Alexander 
Goldhammer, advised he had been in Budapest a short time 
ago, and Mrs. Felbermann, asked him to give her Greetings 
to the Friends here.  
     It occurs to me you may wish to enter into 
correspondence with her, if correspondence to Hungary is 
possible now from West Germany.  You may have 
information from the &Baha'is who left Hungary recently, 
and who, no doubt, were in touch with you.  
     I am also sending a copy of this letter to Mrs. Anne 
Lynch, so she may write to Mrs. Felbermann, if 
correspondence from Switzerland is now possible....

Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     The Beloved Guardian has suggested that your Assembly 
arrange for a telegraphic address in Frankfurt, which will 
simplify telegraphing to your honorable body.  
     Some of the National Assemblies have used the 
designation "&Baha'i".  Thus for instance, when we cable to 
the American NSA, we simply address the cable "&Baha'i, 
Wilmette".  Australia uses "Natbahai".  As soon as you have 
arranged with the cable Company for your telegraphic 
address, please let me know for the Guardian....  
 
 
17 February 1957 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     The Beloved Guardian has directed me to write to your 
Assembly, concerning the settlement of Persian &Baha'is in 
Germany and Austria.  
     He has discussed the matter in some detail with ... when 
they were here, and asked them to review the matter with 
your Assembly.  
     It is artificial to build up communities or Assemblies with 
Persians, or for that matter, any &Baha'is from other 
countries.  The Communities and Assemblies should be 
made up of local people.  Thus in any of the Centers where a 
 
+P289 
large number of Persian &Baha'is have settled, your Assembly 
should discuss the subject with them, and urge them to 
move to goal cities, where there are no &Baha'is, or groups, in 
order to assist in the teaching work.  Thus, the artificial 
Assemblies will necessarily have to be constituted of local 
&Baha'is, and many new centers will be opened.  Thus the 
Persian &Baha'is will become pioneers and greatly aid the 
teaching work.  At the same time, it will mean that the 
German &Baha'is will have to redouble their efforts and win 
many converts to the Faith, in the cities from which the 
Persians move, and which are now artificial.  
     The Guardian hopes this action will stimulate the 
teaching work throughout Germany.  
     He sends you his loving greetings....  
 
 
10 March 1957 
 
Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     The Beloved Guardian is anxious to have an up to date 
record of the number of &Baha'is in the Goal countries of the 
Ten Year Crusade, as of April 1, 1957.  
     To this end I have prepared letters to each country or 
island.  Some of the current addresses etc. I do not have, and 
I am taking the liberty of enclosing letters for the Frisian 
Islands, and Crete.  
     May I ask if you will send them directly to the proper 
persons, by air mail.  
     Please acknowledge and advise if you will arrange to do 
this for me....

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your note of greeting has been received, and our beloved 
Guardian was very happy to see that so many of the 
believers had gathered together, old ones and new ones, and 
he hopes that as a result of your studies and consultation a 
new impetus will be given to the teaching work in Germany.  
     You may be sure he will pray for your success in the holy 
Shrines; and he urges you one and all to concentrate on the 
requirements of the Ten Year Plan as it affects the work in 
Germany....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Beloved bless your highly meritorious efforts, aid 
you to extend continually the scope of your valued 
activities, surmount every obstacle, and lend a tremendous 
impetus to the onward march of our beloved Faith and the 
development and consolidation of its administrative 
institutions,

Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     The Beloved Guardian is very anxious to have an up to 
date record of the total number of &Baha'i Centers in 
Germany and Austria, separately;--excluding, of course, 
the goal areas of the Ten Year Crusade, such as the Frisian 
Islands, etc.  
     May I ask if you will send me a cable on receipt of this 
giving just the totals for each country, as for instance 
 
+P291 
"Germany 100, Austria 25".  There is no need for any 
breakdown of Assemblies, Groups or Isolated Centers....

Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     The Beloved Guardian has been greatly impressed by the 
large number of Teaching Conferences held during the past 
year.  
     I have an incomplete record of a conference held in 
Austria.  Can you cable me if this conference was held, the 
dates, and place....  
     P.S.  Please send the cable immediately on receipt of this 
letter.

Dear &Baha'i Sister:

concerned, the Guardian wishes to know if they are 
residents of Germany, or Persians traveling in Germany, or 
there only for a short time.  When did they arrive, and what 
are their plans.  
     The purpose of this information is that if they actually are 
Persian residents, traveling in Europe, then they will have to 
go on the Persian list, and come when their turn comes 
there.  If they are permanently residing in Germany, then 
the situation is different....  
     P.S.  Also please advise what their background is!

     The Beloved Guardian asked me to advise you, and the 
wife of Mr. Lehne, that he will pray for the progress of Mr. 
Lehne's soul in the realms beyond.  
     He rendered outstanding services to the Faith, holding the 
ideals of the Faith during the difficult days of the war....

know when the time comes for their pilgrimage.

the Guardian must receive them in the order of their 
application.  Thus, when the time comes for ..., the

Beloved Guardian, and he has directed me to acknowledge 
it on his behalf.  
     He is happy to receive word of the progress which you are 
making in connection with the purchase of the Temple 
Land, and the securing of necessary building permits.  He 
hopes you will encounter no serious difficulties in 
connection with the building permit, so that work on this 
most important project, may start at an early date.  
     He will pray for your Assembly, that you may be able to 
overcome all hindrances, and that the path may be 
smoothed for an early conclusion of this troublesome 
matter.  
     So far as the land in Offenbach is concerned, and the plan 
of the city that we finance road work is concerned--this is 
entirely impossible.  The cost is too high, and furthermore 
we should not become involved in local civic projects.

Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     The Beloved Guardian has been very deeply impressed 
with the latest book of our dear departed co-worker, Hand 
of the Cause, George Townshend, "Christ and &Baha'u'llah".  
If you have not received copies, you should send to England 
for them, so that the Friends may be familiar with its 
contents.  
     This book outlines clearly the relationship of Christ and 
&Baha'u'llah, and presents the manner in which the &Baha'i 
Faith is setting up the Kingdom of God, which the 
Christians are praying for.  
     The Guardian feels that your Assembly should make very 
wide use of this book.  You should secure publicity 
regarding it in the Newspapers, book reviews, where 
possible.  Copies should be sent to the Religious leaders, 
particularly to the Lutheran high Dignitaries.  
     This book is a challenge to religious leaders, and of 
course, should be sent, also to those who opposed the 
Temple Land sale.  It may bring some opposition and 
criticism, but in the long run, it will produce excellent 
results for the Faith.  
     The Guardian sends you his loving Greetings....

Dear &Baha'i Sister:  
     When His Excellency Mr. Ollenhauer was in Israel, in 
accordance with the suggestion of your Assembly, effort 
was made to contact him, and invite him to visit the Shrine 
and Gardens on Mt. Carmel.  
     Unfortunately actual contact was not made.  Mr. Ioas 
spent a day in Jerusalem trying to meet him, but he was so 
tied up with Government Officials it was impossible.  Mr. 
Ioas, however, left a note for him, in his hotel, welcoming 
him to Israel, and inviting him to visit Haifa, and our 
Shrines and Gardens.  We gave him also, the Greetings of the 
National Spiritual Assembly of the &Baha'is of Germany, 
whose headquarters are in Frankfurt.  
     Attached is letter received from one of his party 
presumably his Secretary, thanking us for the Greeting, and 
saying he had seen the Shrine and Gardens in company with 
the Mayor of Haifa, when he was in the City.  
     The Beloved Guardian thought you would wish to have 
his letter, and know of the action taken here to effect a 
meeting....  
     You may retain his letter in your files.

letters dated as follows:  June 14, August 8 and 28, 
September 2, October 27, November 19 and 22 and 
December 4 and 26, 1956; and January 1 and 15, February 
4, March 1, 2 and 9, April 2, 16 and 25, June 14, 19 (two) 
and July 3, 8 and 19.  
     As a number of questions raised in your letters have been 
answered by cable, or through the Secretary, I will not go 
into them again here.  
     He thanks your Assembly for the trouble you took in 
sending him the samples of tiles in connection with the 
Archives floor.  A rubber tile has now been ordered from 
England, which he considers will be satisfactory.  
     As a member of your National Assembly has so recently 
visited Haifa, namely, dear Mrs. Anna Grossmann, and 
many of the points concerning the Temple land were 
discussed with her, she has no doubt by now conveyed to 
you the Guardian's views.  
     He feels that the German National Assembly must be 
extremely practical in handling this matter and expedite the 
purchase of a site for the Temple as soon as possible, and 
without strings attached, such as the necessity to build a 
road at our expense, or to raise loans from other National 
Bodies, which is extremely impracticable and very unwise.  
The German friends have money for their land and the 
beginning of their Temple on hand, and should conserve 
this money for the purpose stipulated, and neither ask other 
 
+P297 
National Bodies for loans, nor become involved with 
municipal or state authorities, who want to get as much out 
of the &Baha'is as possible, while, at the same time, it would 
seem, giving them as little help as possible.  
     He also discussed with Mrs. Grossmann certain matters 
she brought up as regards the Temple design and size.  She 
has no doubt reported his views to your Assembly.  
     He was shocked and indignant to hear of the conduct of 
certain of the Persian &Baha'i students in Germany which had 
been so criminal as to lead to their imprisonment.  He feels 
that your Assembly must keep before its eyes the balance 
specified by &Baha'u'llah, Himself, in other words, justice, 
reward and retribution.  Although the Cause is still young 
and tender, and many of the believers inexperienced, and 
therefore loving forbearance is often called for in the place 
of harsh measures, this does not mean that a National 
Spiritual Assembly can under any circumstances tolerate 
disgraceful conduct, flagrantly contrary to our Teachings, 
on the part of any of its members, whoever they may be and 
from wherever they may come.  You should vigilantly watch 
over and protect the interests of the &Baha'i Community, and 
the moment you see that any of the Persian residents in 
Germany, or, for that matter, German &Baha'is themselves, 
are acting in a way to bring disgrace upon the name of the 
Faith, warn them, and, if necessary, deprive them 
immediately of their voting rights if they refuse to change 
their ways.  Only in this way can the purity of the Faith be 
preserved.  Compromise and weak measures will obscure 
the vision of its followers, sap its strength, lower it in the 
eyes of the public and prevent it from making any progress.  
     The National Assembly is the guardian of the welfare of 
the Faith, a most sacred and heavy responsibility and one 
which is inescapable.  They must be ever vigilant, ever on the 
 
+P298 
lookout, ever ready to take action, and, on all matters of 
fundamental principle, refuse to compromise for an instant.  
Only in this way can the body of the Faith be free of disease.  
     He feels that you should investigate the situation in ..., 
find out who is and who is not a &Baha'i, and insist that its 
affairs be conducted in a &Baha'i manner by registered 
&Baha'is, and that those who have not yet gotten credentials 
from Persia should be placed in a different category, 
entirely, from those who are registered by your Assembly as 
voting members, and accepted as believers.  The Persian 
&Baha'is in many cases, who have either gone to Germany to 
study or to assist in the work of the Faith with a pure 
motive, have rendered the German Community inestimable 
services, and everyone should be duly grateful to them for 
both their spirit and their example.  However, we should not 
confuse the true believers with those who are not quickened 
with the spirit of faith, have some ulterior motive, or are 
indifferent to the reputation they have personally, and the 
damage they may do the Cause in the eyes of the public.  
There is all the difference in the world between these two 
categories, and your Assembly must be ever watchful and 
ready to take action when necessary.  
     It is not a normal condition for one-quarter of a 
community to be composed of a foreign, and therefore 
floating, element.  In spite of the fact that in such countries 
as England and Germany, in particular, the Persian friends 
have been of great help in maintaining, and indeed in 
establishing, new Assemblies and Centres, the National 
Body must bear in mind that this is not a normal state of 
affairs.  It is the German people in Germany, and the English 
people in England, who must be the back-bone and the vast 
majority of the Community.  Otherwise, if for some reason 
the foreign element returns to its home or is forced to leave 
 
+P299 
the country, the Communities dependent on it disintegrate 
for lack of numbers.  
     Every effort should be made to encourage the German 
&Baha'is, who are so numerous in some of the cities in 
Germany, particularly in Stuttgart, to go out and take part 
in the establishment of new Spiritual Assemblies in their 
own country.  This is both their duty and their privilege.  The 
Guardian has pointed out, over and over again, that it is 
sufficient for fifteen active believers to remain in any one 
city, even such cities as New York, Chicago and San 
Francisco.  This also applies to Germany, and the &Baha'is 
should be encouraged to pioneer on their Home Front, and 
establish new Spiritual Assemblies, new Groups and new 
isolated centres.  In this way the affairs of the Faith will 
attract the blessings of &Baha'u'llah and the believers will be 
rewarded by Him for doing their duty and accepting the 
challenge of the present hour.  If and when another upheaval 
takes place in Europe, it will be the big cities that are the 
danger points.  Why then do the &Baha'is cling to them so 
tenaciously, when they would be much safer, and serving 
the interests of the Faith, if they moved away to smaller 
places?  
     He does not want the friends to be fearful, or to dwell 
upon the unpleasant possibilities of the future.  They must 
have the attitude that, if they do their part, which is to 
accomplish the goals of the Ten Year Plan, they can be sure 
that God will do His part and watch over them....  
     He has been very happy over the formation of the first 
historic Spiritual Assembly in Athens, an achievement made 
possible this year through the direct efforts of German 
pioneers.  He greatly appreciates their spirit, and he hopes 
that, in spite of the departure of some of the American 
pioneers, the Community will grow in numbers, and the 
 
+P300 
Assembly be preserved next April.  Your Assembly should 
devote particular attention to this matter.  
     He hopes also that reinforcements can be sent to Crete, as 
well as to Frisian Islands, where the first results of the 
devoted labours of the pioneer are beginning to be shown 
through the enrollment of some natives of those islands....  
     He has also been greatly encouraged to see the progress 
made in Austria during the past year.  The formation of four 
Assemblies marks a tremendous step forward in the work in 
that country, which has too long lagged behind the progress 
made in Germany.  At last, Austria is beginning to bear fruit, 
and he hopes, through the activities of the Austrian believers 
and the pioneers who have rallied to their support, as well 
as through the wise guidance of your Assembly, that the 
centres will be increased very rapidly and the Spiritual 
Assemblies multiplied to such a point that he can fix a date 
for Austria to have her independent National Body.  The 
achievement of this goal rests entirely upon the teaching 
work and is dependent on the creation of more Assemblies.  
     He was glad to see that there is great need in Germany for 
more publications, for more of the literature to be made 
available in German.  Naturally these things are dependent 
on financial means.  However, he was happy to know that a 
News Letter had been consistently published in Frankfurt, 
and had been of help to the friends, especially in connection 
with their Nineteen Day Feasts.  Such activities should be 
stimulated and encouraged by your Assembly.  The &Baha'is 
are widely spread over the whole country, many of them far 
from well-to-do, and, however humble the instrument that 
reaches them, it nevertheless fulfils a great purpose in 
stimulating and encouraging them.  Travelling teachers 
should be sent out more regularly to visit the different 
centres, as the two Hands of the Cause in Germany are so 
 
+P301 
overburdened as to make it impossible for them to travel as 
much as they would like to or should do in the interests of 
the Faith.  Therefore your Assembly should encourage 
itinerant teachers or teaching trips by any of the friends who 
are able to offer a certain amount of time to such activities.  
     He has also been very pleased during the past year to see 
from the press clipping book he received, how much 
publicity the Faith has received free of charge, not only in 
the press but generally in some of Germany's best-known 
newspapers.  Were it not for the violent opposition met with 
in connection with the purchase of the Temple land, this 
would not have been possible, and the friends can clearly see 
that our activities, when we carry them on persistently and 
energetically, arouse opposition, which has an extremely 
salutary effect.  In fact, some of the reports in the German 
newspapers about the opposition the &Baha'is were meeting 
with in connection with their Temple site were published in 
leading French newspapers.  The friends should be very 
encouraged by these evidences of the rising fame of the 
Faith.  They should welcome opposition, and stand firm on 
all questions of principle.  By doing so, they will attract new 
people to the Faith and encourage the skeptical to embrace 
our Teachings.  
     He appreciated receiving the photo of the new N.S.A. 
and hopes it will accomplish great things during the coming 
months.  
     It is not necessary for anyone who wishes to make the 
pilgrimage to Haifa to ask through your Assembly; they 
may ask the Guardian direct.  The reason this was done in 
Persia is because the number of the friends is so great that 
the work involved is too much of a demand on the 
Guardian's time, and so is handled by the Persian N.S.A. 
who refer long lists of names to him.  
 
+P302 
     He feels sure the passing of dear Mrs. Reyhani is not 
without significance and that her devotion, and that of her 
family, will be the instrument for attracting many hearts to 
our beloved Faith.  
     The Guardian assures you one and all of his most loving 
prayers for the success of your work and that you may be 
given the strength to carry out burden of responsibility for 
the prosecution of the Ten Year Plan in your area....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
Dear and valued co-workers:  
     The year that has just elapsed, though not one in which 
the fond hopes entertained for the German &Baha'i 
Community have been entirely fulfilled, has, none the less, 
witnessed certain achievements in both the administrative 
and teaching fields, for which we can feel truly grateful.  
     There can be no doubt that the problems, obstacles and 
challenges which have faced the well-tried, long suffering, 
swiftly maturing community have been formidable, and in 
some instances, such as to daunt their spirit and discourage 
their efforts.  
     The continued and most lamentable division of the 
German nation, setting up an almost insurmountable 
barrier between the vast majority of the German followers 
of the Faith of &Baha'u'llah and their isolated brethren in the 
eastern territories of their country; ... the prolonged 
existence of ideological and political barriers impeding 
contact between the believers residing in the western Zone 
of Germany and the inhabitants of the territories lying 
beyond the Iron Curtain and particularly the Baltic States, 
Moldavia, White Russia, Albania and Rumania, assigned to 
them according to the provisions of the Ten-Year Plan; the 
intense conservatism and religious orthodoxy of the people 
inhabiting the Frisian Islands, Crete and Greece, 
 
+P303 
constituting yet another barrier and raising yet another 
obstacle in the path of the pioneers who have consecrated 
themselves to the task of implanting the banner of the Faith 
in those islands in that historic land, in pursuance of the 
objectives of the World Spiritual Crusade; the limitations 
placed upon them by their restricted numbers and modest 
resources; the temptations and distractions to which a swift 
return to material prosperity continually and increasingly 
exposes them--these, no doubt, militate against the speedy 
and effectual accomplishment of their manifold and sacred 
tasks.  
     No need, however, to dwell on the trials, problems and 
the inherent difficulties with which the community of the 
followers of &Baha'u'llah and, to a lesser extent, their sister 
community in Austria, are beset during these critical years 
in the unfoldment of the Ten-Year Plan.  
     However severe their trials, and disheartening the present 
situation may appear, they must remember that the Faith to 
which they owe allegiance has weathered, not so very long 
ago, storms of a far greater severity that seemed, at times, 
capable of engulfing and of obliterating its nascent 
institutions.  The newly planted sapling of a divinely 
conceived administrative order, having driven deep its roots 
in German soil, bent momentarily under the hurricane 
which so violently swept over it, and no sooner had the 
tempest spent its force than it righted itself, and, growing 
with a fresh vigour, put forth branches and offshoots that 
now overshadow the entire land, and even stretch out as far 
as the heart of Austria.  
     The experience of so miraculous a recovery from so 
devastating an ordeal should, alone, prove sufficient to 
infuse an invigorating spirit into those who have been 
subjected to it, as well as into the new generation who are 
 
+P304 
still close enough to those events to appreciate its extreme 
violence, such as will not only enable them to withstand 
onslaughts of still greater severity, but impel them, both 
young and old, men and women alike, to struggle, with 
redoubled vigour and deeper consecration, to meet the 
pressing and the manifold requirements of the present hour.  
     To answer decisively the charges levelled against them, 
and the Faith which they represent, by their adversaries and 
critics, they can do no better than to determine--nay to 
ensure--that their numerical strength will rapidly increase 
throughout the length and breadth of their homeland; that 
the isolated centres, groups and local assemblies will 
multiply to an unprecedented degree; that every firmly 
grounded local spiritual assembly is duly incorporated; 
that the &Baha'i Marriage Certificate and the &Baha'i Holy 
Days are recognized by the Civil authorities; that the 
literature of the Faith in German, Russian and those 
languages spoken in the Baltic States, is not only translated 
to an unprecedented extent, but broadcast far and wide; 
and, above all that their zeal, whatever betide them, will 
remain unquenchable, their spirit indomitable, their loyalty 
inflexible, their determination to succeed unshakable.  
     Whilst efforts in this direction are being strenuously 
exerted by the rank and file of the faithful, a no less 
energetic action must be taken to ensure that the pioneers in 
the newly opened virgin territories, in the North as well as 
in the South will continue to receive adequate guidance and 
assistance, which will enable them to establish new centres 
and reinforce the foundation which they have so patiently 
and devotedly laid.  The institution of the National Fund, so 
indispensable to the vigorous functioning of the multiplying 
institutions of the Faith, must be generously and 
systematically supported by the rank and file of the 
 
+P305 
believers, however great the financial sacrifice involved, it is 
through such sacrifice that these institutions can exert their 
maximum spiritual influence, and contribute their full share 
to the expansion and consolidation of the Faith.  To their 
brethren in the Eastern Zone, so gravely handicapped by the 
unfortunate disabilities which they have, so long and so 
patiently suffered, consistent support, in whatever way 
possible, should be extended, and every avenue should be 
explored to ensure that the flame burning in those valiant 
hearts, so heavily burdened by cares and anxieties, will not 
be extinguished.  The no less vital obligation to introduce, 
however tentatively, the Faith in the territories lying beyond 
the eastern confines of their homeland, and particularly in 
the Baltic States, must be promptly and seriously 
considered, for upon it will, to a very great measure, depend 
the success of the Mission envisaged for them by &Abdu'l-Baha, 
and now confirmed through the provisions of the 
Ten-Year Plan.  The assistance extended to their brethren 
and co-partners in Austria, who have lately succeeded in 
enlarging the scope of their beneficent activities, should, 
moreover be maintained, nay reinforced, for the purpose of 
multiplying the local spiritual assemblies, and of hastening 
thereby the emergence of an independent National Spiritual 
Assembly in that land.  Above all, the burning issue of the 
purchase of the site and of the construction of the Mother 
Temple of Europe must be resolutely faced, and, once and 
for all, definitely settled, even if it becomes necessary to 
abandon Frankfurt, situated in the heart of their country, 
and the national administrative headquarters of their Faith, 
and substitute for it Stuttgart, as a site, for their first 
&Mashriqu'l-Adhkar.  Whatever is to be done should be 
expeditiously carried out, for time is fast running out and 
the Ten-Year Crusade is rapidly and inexorably 
 
+P306 
approaching its midway-point.  All eyes, in every continent 
of the globe where &Baha'is reside, are eagerly and anxiously 
watching, expecting the early and definite settlement of 
these prolonged negotiations, and prayerfully hoping to 
witness the first evidences of the rise of the noble Structure, 
the erection of which has been entrusted to the largest and 
one of the oldest national &Baha'i communities in the 
European continent.  
     The divers and formidable obstacles, challenging the 
spirit and resources of this long-suffering, firmly based, 
highly-endowed, much admired community, have been 
considered and enumerated.  The vital and inescapable 
obligations, calling for immediate resolute action, on the 
part of all of its privileged members, have been touched 
upon and sufficiently emphasized.  Now, if ever, is the time 
for action, with practically half of the period alloted for the 
prosecution of a decadelong Crusade already behind us.  
The German &Baha'i Community, the leading stronghold of 
the Faith on the European mainland, must not, cannot fail.  
All its resources, spiritual as well as material, must be 
mobilized at this hour to ensure the speedy attainment of 
some of the most glorious objectives of a glorious Crusade.  
     I fervently plead with its members, particularly with its 
watchful, painstaking, devoted national elected 
representatives, to arise as one man and carry to a successful 
conclusion yet another stage in the unfoldment of their 
historic Mission.  
     May He Who through His power called this community 
into being, nurtured and bestowed upon it His special 
blessings, crown their present and future efforts with a 
success that will resound throughout the &Baha'i world.  
                                                   Shoghi

Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Our beloved Guardian has instructed me to write you on 
his behalf about....  He has not only received a most 
unhappy and pitiful letter from him but also letters from 
some of the German friends who are distressed and unhappy 
over the severe measures your assembly has taken as regards 
his teaching and freedom of movement.  
     He feels that you should deal with more kindness and 
 
+P308 
leniency in this matter; as far as he understands the 
accusations against him are because of certain emotional 
relationships he has had.  In such matters wisdom and 
patience are required.  It is only in cases of flagrant 
immorality that the Assembly must step in and warn the 
believer in question that they must behave in a way worthy 
of the Faith.  He doubts if ... has conducted himself in such a 
way.  In any case he wishes you to do all you can to help this 
unfortunate situation and prevent it from becoming a 
serious issue....  
 
 
4 September 1957 
 
Dear &Baha'i Co-workers:  
     The Beloved Guardian has cabled you a short time ago 
that he approved in the changes in the Temple which had 
been submitted by you and by Mr. Rocholl.  
     The Guardian has directed me to confirm this matter with 
you so that there might be no misunderstanding.  In other 
words, he feels that the new drawings which you have 
submitted will be satisfactory.  He understands that the 
building itself will be no higher than thirty (30) meters in 
accordance with the Town Planning arrangements of the 
area.  
     As you know he is most anxious about this very vital Goal 
of the Ten Year Crusade and sincerely hopes that all of the 
barriers will now be eliminated and you will soon have 
authority to begin construction work.  
     He is praying for you and for the success of your labors.  
He sends his loving greetings....  
 
+P309 
5 September 1957 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     In a recent letter from ..., he states that he has made an 
offer to the German NSA to defray the expenses of 
translating the latest book of Dr. Townshend, "Christ and 
&Baha'u'llah" and to pay for its publication in German.  
     As I have written you previously, the Guardian attaches 
the utmost importance to this book as he feels it will clarify 
in the minds of everyone the relationship of Christ to 
&Baha'u'llah.  It may shock some of the Orthodox religious 
leaders but at the same time perhaps we have reached the 
point where a shock will do them good.  The Guardian feels 
that even at the present if there should be some adverse 
criticism, in the long run the publication of this book and its 
wide spread will bring about renewed interest and activity in 
the Faith.  
     Thus he hopes your Assembly will see that the book is 
now published at an early date, particularly inasmuch as the 
expense of publication has been defrayed by....
 
 
22 September 1957 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother:  
     At the instruction of our beloved Guardian I am writing 
to inform you that he has requested Mr. Varqa to forward 
to your Assembly on his behalf the sum of five hundred 
pounds sterling.  This contribution is to assist in the many 
tasks your Assembly is carrying out....  
 
+P310 
26 September 1957 (Summer School) 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     Your letter dated August 22nd, which you all joined in 
signing, has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he 
has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  
     He was indeed happy to see that so many of the friends 
were present, and is sure it was a great inspiration and joy 
for all.  
     The thoughts of all the &Baha'is everywhere are now 
centered on achieving the goals of our glorious World 
Spiritual Crusade, and the Guardian assures you of his 
prayers that you may become assisted to perform nobly 
your part, whatever it may be, in the present stage of this 
great Crusade....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Spirit of &Baha'u'llah continually guide your 
steps, inspire and strengthen you, remove every obstacle 
from your path, and graciously assist you to lend an 
unprecedented impetus to the all-important teaching work 
in that promising country, 
                                    Your true brother, 
                                               Shoghi 
 
 
3 October 1957 (Summer School) 
 
Dear &Baha'i Friends:  
     The beloved Guardian has received your note of greeting 
dated September 5th, signed by those in attendance at the 
Summer School.  
     He hopes the friends will focus their attention on the 
needs of the Ten-Year Crusade now moving along so 
 
+P311 
rapidly; and in their home communities endeavour to lend 
every possible assistance in their power to the achievement 
of the objectives alloted to the believers in that land.  This 
will bring them spiritual reinforcement and success, in spite 
of the difficulties that may be encountered by them....  
 
          [From the Guardian:] 
     May the Almighty bless, abundantly and continually, 
your activities, deliberations and services, guide every step 
you take, and fulfil every desire you cherish, for the 
promotion and ultimate triumph of His Faith.  
                                    Your true brother, 
                                               Shoghi 
 
 
27 October 1957 
 
Dear &Baha'i Brother:  
     Your loving letter of October 17th has come duly to hand 
dealing with the question of publishing the Guardian's 
telegram with regard to &Mirza Buzurg in the German &Baha'i 
News.  
     This cablegram has been published in all &Baha'i News and 
therefore there should be no objection to it being published 
in the German News.  When the Guardian speaks of no 
publicity, he refers specifically to newspaper publicity or 
other types of publicity before the public....
