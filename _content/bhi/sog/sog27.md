<span class="smallcaps">Of Work and Fruitfulness</span>

Ye are the trees of My Garden; ye must bear fresh and beautiful fruits,
that ye and others may be profited by them. Therefore it is necessary
for ye to engage in arts and business.

This, O possessors of intellect, is the means of attaining wealth.
Affairs depend upon means, and the blessing of God will appear therein
and will enrich ye. Fruitless trees have been and will be only fit for
fire.

O My Servant! The lowest of men are those who bear no fruit upon the
earth; they are indeed counted as dead. Nay, the dead are preferred in
the Presence of God before those who are indolent and negligent.

O My Servant! The best of people are they who gain by work, and spend
for themselves and their kindred in the love of God, the Lord of the
creatures.

The principle of faith is to lessen words and to increase deeds. He
whose words exceed his acts, know verily, that his non-being is better
than his being, and death better than his life.
