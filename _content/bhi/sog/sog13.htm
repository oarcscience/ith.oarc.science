<p><i>The Fifth Valley:</i></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Valley of Contentment</span></h3>  
<p>In this valley he (the traveller) discovers the breezes of Divine Contentment, which waft from the desert of the Spirit, and consume the veils of poverty.</p>  
<p>There he witnesses the day wherein 'God will make all independent out of His abundance.'</p>  
<p>(He will witness this day) with his outward and inward eye in the visible and invisible parts of things. He passes from sadness to joy; and he changes depression and dejection into gladness and cheerfulness.</p>  
<p>Though the travellers in this valley outwardly dwell on the earth, yet inwardly they recline on the high couch of Significances, and they partake of ideal, imperishable benefits, and quaff pure, spiritual wines.</p>  
<p>The tongue is unable to give an account of these three (last) valleys, and utterance falls exceeding short. The pen cannot step into this court, and the ink gives no result but blackness.</p>  
<p>Concerning these states the nightingale of the heart has other melodies and mysteries which set the heart in agitation and the spirit in uproar.</p>  
<p><a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="green">p. 72</font></A></p>  
<p>But this enigma of Significances must be only revealed from heart to heart, and confided from breast to breast.</p>  
<p>Heart alone can communicate to heart the state of the knower (of divine secrets); this is not the work of a messenger, nor can this be contained in letters. On many points I keep silent because of my inability; to state them is beyond speech, and if I say them my words would be insufficient.</p>  
<p>Not until thou reachest the garden of these Significances wilt thou taste of the immortal wine of this valley. If thou tastest thereof thou wilt close thine eyes to all strangers, and drink from the wine of contentment. Thou wilt sever thyself from all, and become united with Him; give up thy life in His Way, and pour out thy soul freely;&#8212;although there is no stranger in this station, that thou shouldest close thine eyes; 'There was but God, but there was nothing with Him.' Because, in this stage, the traveller beholds the beauty of the Friend in everything.</p>  
<p>In fire he sees the Face of the Beloved; in unreality perceives the sign of the Reality; and through the attributes he witnesses the Mystery of the Divine Substance (or Essence), for he has consumed the veils with a mere sigh, and removed the coverings with a single gaze.</p>  
<p>He looks upon the new creation with a discerning sight; and comprehends subtle signs with a pure heart.</p>  
<p><a name="page_73"><font size="1" color="green">p. 73</font></A></p>  
<p>'At that Day we will make thy sight discerning,'&#8212;is an evidence of this saying, and is sufficient for this instance."</p>  
<p>[The Valley of Contentment is sometimes translated as the Valley of Richness.]</p>  
<p>"After traversing the Valley of Pure Contentment, the traveller reaches the Valley of Astonishment.</p>
