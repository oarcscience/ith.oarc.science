<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Of Obedience</span></p>  
<p>The principle of religion is to acknowledge what is revealed by God, and to obey the laws established in His Book.</p>  
<p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="green">p. 105</font></A></p>  
<p>The source of all good is trust in God, obedience to His Command, and satisfaction in His Will,</p>  
<p>O Son of Existence! Keep My Commands for love of Me, and deny thyself thine own desires if thou wishest My Pleasure.</p>  
<p>Neglect not My Laws if thou lowest My Beauty; and forget not My Counsels if thou art hopeful to attain My Will.</p>  
<p>O Son of Man! If thou run through all immensity and speed through the space of Heaven, thou shalt find no rest save in obedience to Our Command and in devotion before Our Face.</p>  
<p>Magnify My Command that I may reveal to thee the secrets of greatness and illumine thee with the Lights of Eternity.</p>  
<p>Be submissive to Me that I may descend to thee; and serve My Cause that thou mayest be victorious in Me.</p>  
<p>Ponder over thy condition and be thoughtful in action. Dost thou prefer to die upon thy bed, or to be martyred in My Path upon the dust; to be a Manifestation of My Command and an expression of My Light in the Highest Paradise I Discern justly, O My Servant.</p>
