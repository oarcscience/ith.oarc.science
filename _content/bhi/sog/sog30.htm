<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Of Companionship</span></p>  
<p>The company of the wicked increaseth sorrow; and the fellowship of the righteous removeth the rust of the mind.</p>  
<p>He who desires to associate with God, let him associate with His Beloved; and he who desires to hear the Word of God, let him hear the words of His chosen ones.</p>  
<p>Walk not with the wicked and confederate not with him; for the companionship of the wicked changeth the Light of Life into fire of remorse.</p>  
<p>If thou seekest the attainment of the Holy Spirit, be a companion of the noble; for the righteous have quaffed from the Chalice of Immortality passed by the hand of the Cup-Bearer</p>

<p>of Eternity, and they quicken and illumine the hearts of the dead as doth the true morn.</p>  
<p>O Friend! In the garden of the heart plant only flowers of Love. Esteem the friendship of the just; but withdraw both mind and hand from the company of the wicked.</p>
