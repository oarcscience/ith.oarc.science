*The Splendour of God*, by Eric Hammond, \[1909\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Revealed by Baha‘u‘llah, at Akka.  
Translated by Ali Kuli Khan.

"As to the meaning of the Cause of Baha‘u‘llah: know that whatever there
is which has to do with the Universal Good, is divine—and whatever is
divine is, certainly, for the universal good. If it is true, it is for
all; if not, it is for no one. Therefore a Divine Cause of Universal
Good cannot be limited either to the East or to the West; for the
radiance of the Sun of Truth illumines both the East and the West, and
it makes its heat felt in the South as in the North; there is no
difference between one pole and the other."

*From The Tablet of Ishraket Baha‘u‘llah*.
