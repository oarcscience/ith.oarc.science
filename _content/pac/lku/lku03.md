### THE SECOND ERA.

#### FIRST VERSE.

The first child born of Powehiwehi (dusky night)  
Tossed up land for Pouliuli (darkest night),  
For Mahiuma or Maapuia,  
And lived in the land of Pohomiluamea (sloughy hill of Mea);  
Suppressed the noise of the growth of unripe fruit,  
For fear Uliuli would cause it to burst, and the stench  
To disagree and turn sour,  
For pits of darkness and pits of night.  
Then the seven waters became calm.  
Then was born a child (kama), ’twas a Hilu and swam.  
The Hilu is a fish with standing fins,  
On which Pouliuli sat.

The train of Palaoa (walrus) that swim by  
Embracing only the deep blue waters,  
Also the Opule that move in schools,  
The deep is as nothing to them.  
And the Kumimi (a crab) and Lohelohe (a locust) cling together  
To the rolling motion of their cradle  
On their path so narrow, so slim, to move,  
Till Pimoe (a mermaid) is found in the depth of her cave,  
With Hikawainui, and Hikawaina  
Amongst piles of heated coral  
That were thrown in piles unevenly,  
So thin and scraggy in the blue tide.  
Surely it must be dismal, that unknown deep;  
’Tis a sea of coral from the depth of Paliuli,  
And when the land recedes from them  
The east is still in darkness of night,  
                ’Tis night.
