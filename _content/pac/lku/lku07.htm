<p>The mites of the land,<br> The mites of the water,<br> &#8217;Tis Mehe the reddish seaweed<br> Whose lashes stand,<br> That hides and peeps.<br> There are rats inland, there are rats at sea.<br> There are also rabbits<br> That were born in the night of the crash--<br> They were born in the night that moved away.<br> The tiniest mice move by crawling;<br> The tiny mice spring as they move.<br> They run over the pebbles,<br> The propagating pebbles where no inland ohia bear.<br> A puny child born in the night of the crash.<br> They gave birth to beings that leaped in the night, that moved away<br> The child of Uli-a-kama last night.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8217;Tis night.</p>
