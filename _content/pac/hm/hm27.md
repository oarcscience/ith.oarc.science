### XXV

### THE MOIKEHA-LA‘A MIGRATION

FROM Ulu and Nana-ulu, sons of Ki‘i, twelfth in succession from Wakea
and Papa, all high chief families count descent. Hikapoloa, as well as
the Waha-nui and Keikipaanea families of early legend, belong to the
Nanaulu line, The important Maweke family is, according to Kamakau, the
first of that line from whom men today trace ancestry. Their
contemporaries are the Paumakua of Oahu, the Kuhiailani of Hawaii, Puna
of Kauai, Hua of Maui, and the Kamauaua of Molokai. To the Ulu line
belongs the late migration of chiefs introduced by Paao to the island of
Hawaii, from whom most families of that island trace descent. Both
legends, that of Paao and that of Maweke, are believed to have bearing
upon early colonization of the Hawaiian group from North Tahiti.

The coming of Maweke and his sons to the Hawaiian group is dated
sometime between the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Their descendants
are supposed to have occupied the whole of Oahu and spread to the
islands of Kauai, Maui, and Molokai, and hence, some say, the
differences in speech and custom between these islands and Hawaii. Of
the three sons of Maweke, Mulieleali‘i who inherited his father's lands
on the south side of the island of Oahu, Keaunui who settled the western
end of the island, and Kalehenui who took the north side, it is the
children of the first about whom legends are told today. Of the three
sons of Mulieleali‘i, Kumuhonua, Moikeha, and Olopana, it is the
firstborn, Kumuhonua, who succeeds to his father's lands. Kamakau
asserts that the two younger brothers, Moikeha and Olopana, make a sea
attack upon him and are defeated and taken captive, together with La‘a.
However this may be, the Kumuhonua line of Oahu ruling chiefs ends with
Haka. With Mailikukahi, who succeeds Haka, the Moikeha branch is
established as the ruling line. <span id="fr_905"></span>[1](#fn_905)

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

### LEGEND OF MOIKEHA-OLOPANA

Olopana settles in Waipio on Hawaii and Lu‘ukia, grand-daughter of
Hikapoloa of Kohala, becomes his wife. They are driven out by a flood
and retire to Kahiki where some say Moikeha is living, others that he
was with Olopana in Waipio. Moikeha becomes infatuated with Lu‘ukia and
Olopana raises no objections; but a rival suitor, Mua, who cannot win
her favor, pretends to her that Moikeha is defaming her publicly, and
she will have nothing more to do with Moikeha. The chief therefore
leaves his lands under the care of Olopana and paddles away in a canoe
manned by companions whose names, as recorded, are perpetuated as place
names on the Hawaiian group. His canoes beach on the island of Kauai, at
Waimahanalua, in Kapa‘a in Wailua. The pretty daughters of the chief
Puna are out surfing. They take Moikeha for their husband and he
succeeds at Puna's death to his father-in-law's lands. . . .

Moikeha's son Ho‘okamali‘i settles at Ewa on Oahu, Haulanui-aikea
remains on Kauai, Kila goes to Hilo, Hawaii. Other sons named are
Umalehu, Kaialea, Ke-kai-hawewe, Lau-kapalala. His two wives are
Ho‘oipo-i-ka-malanai and Hina-uulua \[but both names may belong to a
single woman and "Sweetheart in the trade wind" may be a chant name for
the Hina-uulua who appears on the Nana-ulu genealogy as wife of Moikeha
and mother of Ho‘okamali‘i who succeeds his father\].

On the journey from the south the party touches first at the easternmost
point of Hawaii and the younger brothers of Moikeha (Kumukahi and
Ha‘eha‘e) remain at Puna; the kahunas Mo‘okini and Ka-lua-wilinau make
their home at Kohala; Honua-ula lands in Hana on Maui; the sisters
Makapu‘u and Makaaoa land on Oahu \[where Kila visits them when he sails
after La‘a, and Hi‘iaka claims Makupu‘u as relative in ghost form on her
journey about Oahu\]. The rest of the party go on to Kauai. These
include the paddlers Ka-pahi and Moana-ikaiaiwe, the sailing master
Kipu-nui-aiakamau, with his mate, especially skilled in maneuvering a
canoe by backing water; the spy Kaukaukamunolea, with his mate, who goes
later as pilot with Kila

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

to Kahiki; and the foster son of Moikeha, the chanter Kamahualele (Child
of the flying spray). Between Lanai and Molokai, Moikeha has joined to
his company a kupua called Kakaka-uha-nui (Strong-chested Kakaka) who
has such long legs he can steady a canoe as he stands in the water and
can stay under water for a long time without breathing. It is he who, on
the return voyage with Kila, wins a match in a diving contest with the
tide kupua Ke-au-miki and Ke-au-ka by staying under water "ten nights
and two" to their ten nights.

The fine chant calling upon Moikeha to make his home in Hawaii is
supposed to have been composed by Kamahualele as the canoe first sighted
land, some say at South cape in Kau district, others off the Hilo coast.

Eia Hawaii, he moku, he kanaka,  
He kanaka Hawaii--e,  
He kanaka Hawaii,  
He kama na Kahiki,  
He pua alii mai Kapaahu,  
Mai Moa-ulu-nui-akea Kanaloa,  
He moopuna na Kahiko, laua o Kapulanakehau. . . .

"Here is Hawaii, an island, a man,  
Hawaii is a man indeed,  
Hawaii is a man,  
A child of Tahiti,  
A royal offspring from Kapaahu,  
From Moa-ula-nui-akea of Kanaloa,  
A grandchild of Kahiko and Kapulanakehau.  
It was Papa who bore him,  
The daughter of Ku-kalani-ehu and Kahaka-ua-koko,  
The island offspring from a single group,  
Set evenly from east to west,  
As if spread out in a row,  
And joined onto Holani,  
Kaialea the seer journeyed about the land,  
Separated Nu‘uhiwa, landed on Polapola,  
Kahiko is the rootstock of the land,  
He divided up and separated the islands, <span id="page_355">p.
355</span>  
The fishline of Kaha‘i is broken, Cut by Ku-kanaloa,  
The lands are divided into sections, into districts,  
Divided by the sacred bamboo knife of Kanaloa,  
Haumea is the bird sailing to Kahiki,  
Moikeha is the chief who dwells there,  
My chief dwells in Hawaii,  
He lives! he lives!  
The chief lives and the kahuna,  
The soothsayer lives and the slave,  
He dwells on Hawaii and is at rest,  
He grows to old age on Kauai,  
Kauai is the island,  
Moikeha is the chief!" <span id="fr_906"></span>[2](#fn_906)

### LEGEND OF KILA AND LA‘A-MAI-KAHIKI

(*a*) Moikeha wishes to summon from Kahiki a certain La‘a (Sacred one)
of peculiarly high rank, either a son or adopted son, left behind at the
time of the migration to Hawaii. The object seems to be to insure the
transportation of his bones back to Kahiki at his death. He tests his
sons to see which will have endurance for the voyage to Kahiki. Kila's
toy boat made out of a ti leaf passes directly between the father's
legs; the other boys' boats miss the mark. The boys are jealous and try
to trap Kila away to a dart-throwing contest in order to make away with
him, but the father will not allow it. Before the expedition starts,
Kila proposes to take a "god" along with him to protect him from his
brothers, and the brothers are afraid to accompany him. On the journey
to Kahiki, Kila first visits the members of Moikeha's company who have
settled on other islands and at each stop there ensues a repetitive
dialogue: "Who are you?" "Kila of the uplands, Kila of the lowlands,
Kila born of the Woman-of-the-trade-winds, the child of Moikeha." "Is
Moikeha then alive?" "He is alive." "What kind of life is he living?"
"Dwelling at ease on Kauai where the sun rises and sets; where the surf
of Makaiwa curves and bends; by the changing blossoms of the kukui of
Puna; by the broad waters of Wailua. He

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

will live on Kauai and die on Kauai." "What is the journey of the chief
for?" "A journey to seek a chief." "What chief?" "La‘amaikahiki." Kila
goes on to Kahiki, stopping first at a place called Moa-ula-nui-akea-iki
to get a food supply from his uncle Ku-pohihi the rat-man, then greeting
his aunt Lu‘ukia, and finally ascending to Lani-keha at Moa-ula-nui-akea
to find La‘a. Kamahualele advises his consulting the aged priestess
Ku-hele-po-lani. She tells him that when he hears the beating of
Moikeha's drum Hawea from the mountains of Kapaahu where La‘a is in
hiding under tapu, he must sacrifice a man on the altar of Lanikeha,
then go up with her to the heiau and hide himself inside while she, as a
woman, remains outside, and when his brother comes to strike the drum
and the priests line up and begin chanting, then he must address La‘a
and give Moikeha's message. Kila obeys these instructions and La‘a obeys
the message. By the sound of the drum beating off Kauai, Moikeha is made
aware of La‘a's coming. <span id="fr_907"></span>[3](#fn_907)

(*b*) Moikeha tests his three sons to see which one is ablest for a
journey to Kahiki. Kila's toy boat strikes his father's navel and by
this sign Moikeha knows that he will excel the others. Moikeha later
fits out a canoe and sends Kila to avenge him upon his enemies in
Kahiki. On the journey the long-breathed man Kakaka-uha-nui saves him
from the tide kupua who would drag the canoe to the bottom. At a
neighboring island to Kahiki lives Kane-pohihi, a rat-woman who is
Moikeha's aunt. Kila finds her blind and roasting bananas, makes himself
known, and is told that the chiefs are all dead, Kahuahuakai being the
last of them; but Kila knows that La‘a is still there, guarded by Huihui
and Maeele. He is in need of food and his aunt in rat form nibbles the
rope which releases the food that Makali‘i has drawn up in a net out of
reach.

At the tapu harbor of the main island, Mua, the lover of Lu‘ukia who
caused Moikeha's withdrawal, comes down to meet the canoe and, finding
in Kila a man handsome enough to be-guile Lu‘ukia, whom he still hopes
to win, determines to use him as a lure; for Lu‘ukia, although her
husband Olopana has dropsy and cannot enjoy her favors himself, has
refused all

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

lovers since Moikeha left her. Kila pretends to accept the plot, but has
Mua killed. His warriors then defeat those of Makali‘i, although half
their size. He himself gives their leader such a blow that Makali‘i lies
stunned "long enough to cook an oven of food," then picks himself up and
returns "up above," where he remains until his death and never shows
himself on earth again.

Kila ascends, greeted by the wailings of the former people of the land,
until he comes to Moikeha's ancient house, built with posts of kauila
wood and battens of birds' bones, but now empty and overgrown with
weeds. One by one the guards come to life as he enters. He goes to sleep
on Moikeha's couch. Lu‘ukia enters and, seeing his resemblance to
Moikeha, embraces him, al-lows him to untie the cord with which she has
been bound against the approach of men, and the two become lovers. (The
mission to La‘a is omitted in this romantic version.) <span
id="fr_908"></span>[4](#fn_908)

 

(*c*) Kila is named in memory of Lu‘ukia and is more beloved by Moikeha
than any of his brothers. Moikeha hence instructs Kila in the art of
navigation and the knowledge of the stars and makes him leader of an
expedition to Kahiki after La‘a. His place is on the high platform
between the canoes while the two older brothers manage the canoes. The
canoe calls at Waianae to acquaint Moikeha's former companion of the
life the chief is living. At Kahiki, Olopana is high chief and Lu‘ukia
chiefess. La‘a is the heir. The land is rich and people are living at
ease. Olopana refuses to let La‘a go until after he himself is dead;
then he may go to Moikeha. On the return of the expedition, Kila settles
at Hilo, Ho‘okamali‘i at Ewa on Oahu, Haulanuiaiakea on Kauai, and from
all three descend chiefs and commoners of these islands. <span
id="fr_909"></span>[5](#fn_909)

 

### LEGEND OF KILA AND HIS JEALOUS BROTHERS

La‘a-mai-kahiki returns to Kahiki after Moikeha's death and Kila becomes
ruling chief of Kauai. The brothers are jealous and entice him away on
an expedition to Waipio after their father's bones, which have been left
hidden in the cliff of Haena.

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

\[paragraph continues\] They abandon him there and tell their mother at
home that the canoe was upset, Kila seized by a shark, and the bones
lost. He passes in Waipio as a slave, but often when he climbs Puaahuku
after firewood a rainbow accompanies him and the priest of the temple of
Pakaalana suspects his rank. When he is accused of eating tapu food, he
flees to this temple. The ruling chief adopts him under the name of Lena
and makes him land agent. It is he who devises the system of working a
certain number of days for the chief. He is beloved for his industry. In
the time of Hua there is a famine. His brother Kaialea comes from Kauai
after food. Kila has him thrown into prison until he will confess the
whole truth, but saves him from death. The mothers and brothers are
summoned. When the mothers learn the truth they say the brothers must
die. Kila intercedes and all are reconciled. The mothers are given the
rule over Kauai and Kila remains in Waipio. Later he goes to Kahiki with
La‘a-mai-kahiki to deposit Moikeha's bones. <span
id="fr_910"></span>[6](#fn_910)

### LEGEND OF LA‘A-MAI-KAHIKI'S TRIPLET SONS

La‘a is received on Kauai by Moikeha and his kahuna Poloahi-lani. He
settles at Kahiki-nui on Maui but, finding it too windy, removes to the
west coast of Kahoolawe, whence he sails back to Kahiki. His principal
place of residence is at Kualoa on Oahu. Here he has three wives,
daughters of three chiefs of this region, all of whom give birth on the
same night. Hoaka-nui-kapuaihelu, daughter of Lono-ka-ehu, chief of
Kualoa. is the mother of Lauli-a-la‘a; Waolena from Kaalaea, of Ahukini;
Mano from Kaneohe, of Kukona. Mano's child came last, but when she heard
that the other wives had given birth she used energetic means to hasten
her child's arrival and hence her name of "Mano who slapped her abdomen"
(Mano-opu-pa‘ipa‘i). <span id="fr_911"></span>[7](#fn_911) A chant
\[from Kamehameha's day\] records the incident:

"Ahukai (the father), La‘a (the son),  
La‘a, La‘a, La‘a-mai-kahiki the chief;  
Ahukini son of La‘a, <span id="page_359">p. 359</span>  
Kukona son of La‘a,  
Lauli son of La‘a,  
The triple canoe (triplets) of La‘amaikahiki,  
The sacred firstborn sons of La‘a  
Who were born on the same day."

### TRADITION OF LA‘A-MAI-KAHIKI AND THE HULA DRUM

(*a*) It is La‘a-mai-kahiki who introduces image worship in the shape of
the figure Lono-i-ka-ouali‘i and the coconut fiber rope called
Lanalana-wa‘a. He is most famous as the bringer of the kaeke drum and
the hula dance to Hawaii. When the people hear the noise of the drum and
the nose-flute as his canoe passes the coast of Hawaii they say, "It is
the canoe of the god Kupulupulu (Laka)" and bring offerings. <span
id="fr_912"></span>[8](#fn_912)

(*b*) La‘a sails with a company consisting of his kahuna Kukaikupolo,
his astronomer Kukeao-ho‘omihamiha, his diviner (Luhau-kapawa), his seer
Maula, his drummer Kupa, and forty men to handle the canoes. They pass
to the left of Hawaii and sail north past Maui and Molokai sounding the
drum over the sea. A certain man named Haikamalama hears the strange
sound from the Oahu coast at Hanauma bay and follows the canoe along the
shore, beating out the notes on his breast to get the rhythm, and
repeating the drummer's chant. When the canoe beaches at
Ka-waha-o-ka-mano in Waihaukalua, he pretends, in order to get a good
look at it, that the drum is well known on Oahu, and then makes an exact
copy of his own. <span id="fr_913"></span>[9](#fn_913)

 

The names of Olopana and Lu‘ukia in the Moikeha-Kila legend for
relatives of Moikeha left behind in Kahiki make it probable that the
Moikeha family migrated from the north-western of the three land
divisions into which old Tahiti was

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

divided; that is, from the Oropa‘a (Olopana) division dominated by the
powerful Oropa‘a family. Puna-au-ia is the chief district, through which
runs the great valley of Punaru‘u, a name found also on Hawaii.
Mou‘a-ula-nui-akea as the former name for the land division on the north
now called Tahara‘a suggests the Moa-ula-nui-akea of the Kila story.
Taputapuatea is a great marae (temple) at Opoa on Ra‘iatea. <span
id="fr_914"></span>[10](#fn_914)

The Oropa‘a were a rugged family of warriors whose name appears far up
oh the line of descent of the Pomare family. Later they retreated into
the mountains before invading peoples. Lizards (mo‘o) were their family
gods and lowering clouds lying with fringed edges on the horizon are
called after the fork-tailed lizard. <span
id="fr_915"></span>[11](#fn_915) Tipa, whose "shadow" on earth was a
species of lizard, was the healing god of sickness and disease of the
Oropa‘a chiefs. <span id="fr_916"></span>[12](#fn_916) In myth there is
an Oropa‘a, god of ocean, son of Tumu-nui and Papa-raharaha. The
man-of-war bird is his shadow, the whale his messenger. <span
id="fr_917"></span>[13](#fn_917) In chant it is said that "he lies with
head upwards when the breezes come. The white-foaming breakers are his
jaws. He swallows whole persons and fleets of people; he does not spare
princes." <span id="fr_918"></span>[14](#fn_918)

Lu‘ukia is not mentioned in Tahitian genealogies, but in Maori tradition
Tu-te-koropanga and Rukutia his wife (Olopana and Lu‘ukia in Hawaiian)
appear on the royal genealogy "relating to the period of occupation of
the Society islands." The names of Koropanga and Rukutia occur in
Tongareva as "two adjacent islands on the north side of the lagoon."
Rukutia introduces culture elements. "Be ye girded with the mat of
Rukutia," says a Maori chant, and again, "Be ye tattooed after the
manner of Rukutia." <span id="fr_919"></span>[15](#fn_919) Irapanga is
said by the Maori to have migrated with his children and sub-tribes to
Ahu (Oahu) and hence originated the people of Hawaiki, Maui, and other
islands. To reach it they sail north-east from Tawhiti-nui. They name
the big island Hawaikirangi, and this is the old name for the Hawaiian
group. From

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

here they migrate to Rangiatea (Ra‘iatea) and Rarotonga. The Maori call
Lanai, Maui-pae; Molokai, Maui-taka.

In Hawaii the introduction of the bark-cloth skirt of five thicknesses
commonly worn by women is ascribed to Lu‘ukia, as well as the network
cover used for water gourds and for the lashings of the outrigger of a
canoe, supposed to be wrought after the pattern of the protection with
which her thighs were bound against the approach of lovers after her
quarrel with Moikeha. So sacred is such a form of canoe lashing that
death is the penalty for intruding while the work is being done. <span
id="fr_920"></span>[16](#fn_920) According to one story, the house of
separation set up between Kawaihee and Waimea while she and Olopana were
living at Waipio, to which she retired during her monthly periods, was a
novelty in Hawaii. Waiauwia, a man of prominence in Waimea who followed
her there, had never heard of the tapu for women at this time. <span
id="fr_921"></span>[17](#fn_921) A cave is pointed out in Hana district
on Maui where Lu‘ukia is said to have taught tapa beating to the women
of Hana. The cave goes by the name of Hana-o-Lu‘ukia (Work of Lu‘ukia),
the long *a* representing a profession carried on, rather than
incidental labor.

Hawaiian legend links Lu‘ukia with the Hikapoloa family of Kohala on
Hawaii, but some say she belongs to Tahiti and not to the Hawaiian
group. In the Hainakolo romance she is a relative of Hainakolo belonging
to Waipio or to Hamakua district, who adopts Hainakolo's child, brings
him up as a waif, and later makes him her husband. In the Uweuwelekehau
romance she is daughter of Olopana at Wailua on Kauai and takes as
husband her cousin, who comes to her from Hawaii in the form of a fish
but with the marks of a chief. An incomplete story from a school
composition makes her the daughter of Hamau and Hooleia of Puako, South
Kohala, and wife of Kama-o-ahu on Oahu. When her young brother Makahi
comes to visit her and wins a betting contest in spear throwing with
Kaaiai of Oahu, Lu‘ukia's husband takes him for a former lover of his
wife and insults him. <span id="fr_922"></span>[18](#fn_922) All these

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

stories agree in making Lu‘ukia the heroine of a love affair with a
young husband, which makes trouble with her first husband or an older
relative.

About the name of Olopana also certain traditions persist in Hawaii. He
is said to have been afflicted with dropsy. After Moikeha's departure
one version has it that as ruler of Moaula-nui-akea he makes himself so
beloved that Moikeha's uncle sends him away and he emigrates to the
Hawaiian group. He is said to have brought there the style of tattooing
and to have enforced the tapu system. Some say there are three different
Olopana chiefs mixed up in Hawaiian story, one belonging to Tahiti,
another to the legend of Moikeha, a third to the Kamapua‘a legend. In
one romance, that of Uweuwelekekau, Olopana is the older brother of Ku
and Hina at Wailua, Kauai. Olopana and Ku quarrel and Ku, followed by
his sister Hina, settles at Pi‘i-honua, Hilo, Hawaii. <span
id="fr_923"></span>[19](#fn_923) In the romance of Ke-ao-melemele, when
Ku has an affair with in "one of the large islands of the heavens," his
wife Hina is taken by Olopana and their child is adopted by Ku and
Hi‘ilei. <span id="fr_924"></span>[20](#fn_924) Here again the woman
seems to be the wife of two brothers.
