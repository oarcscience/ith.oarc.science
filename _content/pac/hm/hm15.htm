<p>LOCAL legends abound of the swift retribution visited by Pele upon those who dare to offend her. Presumption and boasting bring immediate punishment. Rivals in love serve as explanatory theme for lava-rock formations. The popular chiefly sport of sled (holua) racing is worked into a number of legends in which a mere mortal dares competition with Pele. Kapapala, after competing successfully with Pele's pretty sisters, ventures to challenge Pele herself upon the waves of the volcano and is consumed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_470"></A><A HREF="#fn_470"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Papa-lauahi is about to win a race to which Pele has challenged him when, looking back over his shoulder, he sees the goddess in her fire form at his back and is overwhelmed in a flood of lava.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_471"></A><A HREF="#fn_471"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> The most famous of these competition legends is that of Kahawali, localized along a comparatively fresh lava stream running down to the sea from above Kapoho in the district of Puna. Lava rocks are said to mark the fate of members of Kahawali's family and of his favorite pig. The famous tree-molds (Papa-lau-ahi) above Kapoho are introduced as a group of hula pupils caught in the trail of Pele's wrath. For stories of destructive lava flows within historic times in which Pele is believed to have shown her wrath or her favor, see the historic account of the destruction of Keoua's army&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_472"></A><A HREF="#fn_472"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and of Kamehameha's fishponds.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_473"></A><A HREF="#fn_473"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">LEGEND OF THE BOASTER</h3>

<p><FONT SIZE="-1">Paula is a beautiful girl who lives in Ka-u district on Hawaii between Naalehu and Honoapu. Pele's lover once finds her with two companions engaged in her favorite sport of kimo (jack-stones) and lingers to play with her. Pele came along looking for her lover, and there at the point called Ka-lae-o-kimo the two may be seen turned to stone just as Pele found them. The other two were also buried in lava, but only the pebbles they tossed are now visible.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_475"></A><A HREF="#fn_475"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></FONT></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">LEGEND OF KAHAWALI</h3>

He has a wife and two children named Paupoulu and Kaohe, a mother living at Kuki&#8216;i, and a sister Koae at Kula. His father and another sister named Kane-wahine-keaho live on Oahu. Kahawali is an expert in the hula dance and in riding the holua. At the time of the Lono festival, when the hula pupils have gathered for a public appearance, a sled race is arranged with his friend Ahua. Pele in the guise of an old woman offers to compete with him. Angry at the chief's rebuff, she pursues him down the hill in fire form. He flees first to the hill Pu&#8216;ukea, then hastens to bid goodby to his wife and children, pauses to say farewell to his favorite pig Aloi-pua&#8216;a, and has just time to greet his sister at Kula before escaping to the sea in a canoe which his brother has opportunely brought to land.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_476"></A><A HREF="#fn_476"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></FONT></p>

<p><FONT SIZE="-1">Pele appears to two girls of Ka-u roasting breadfruit and asks for food and drink. One gives kindly, the other excuses herself on the ground that the food is dedicated to Laka. A flood of fire comes and destroys the home of the stingy girl, but the generous one has been warned and has set up the necessary protection.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_477"></A><A HREF="#fn_477"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></FONT></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Many heiaus to the goddess Pele were erected in old days, especially beside lava streams and at the edge of the crater, and the bodies of the dead are still offered to the goddess in the belief that their spirits will live again with Pele in a beautiful home beneath the burning pit which is the goddess's material body, and go forth as her messengers in bodies of flame to avenge any infringement of her tapus and to work her will in the land. Only those connected with the Pele family by being born with a human body from one of the Pele spirits, or a direct descendant of one of these, or one outside the family who has been adopted and given a name (in dream) by Pele herself, have a right to such a burial. Ancestral gods of the Pele family, called kumu-pa&#8216;a (descended from the source), such as Haumea, Kane-hekili, Ka-hoali&#8216;i, Kane-wawahi-lani, Kauila-nui-makeha-i-ka-lani, No-kolo-i-lani, Kamoho-alii, Polo, Hi&#8216;iaka, Na-maka-o-kaha&#8216;i, may bring their direct descendants into the Pele family. These are kumupa&#8216;a who may be worshiped as aumakua. They do not belong among the supreme gods and their kahunas are not in the line of the old priesthood of Hikapoloa. The worship of Pele was not taught in the schools of the priesthood nor was her body deified. Pele's descendants alone worship her. Only actual relatives invoke her and become her keepers. Pele names are given to children born into her family, but such names belong to that individual alone and cannot be passed on to another, even to an own child. One such Pele name, given to an older sister of Mrs. Pukui, is Kukuena-i-ke-ahi-ho&#8216;omau-honua (Kukuena in the fire which fertilizes the earth). Here "Kukuena" is the name of a sister of Pele who acts as guide</p>

<p>to travelers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_478"></A><A HREF="#fn_478"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> and the word "ho&#8216;omau" means literally to dampen or render moist, in allusion to the cool home beneath the volcano to which Pele admits those of her family on earth whose bodies are offered to her at death. An old Kona resident tells the following story:</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">In old days a man's mother said she was to go to Pele in the volcano. The son took her by the old road around through Kau called Ka-ala-Pele (The Pele road), not by the new road, and left her at a distance along the way and said, "If your god is a true god she will come and take you." As he left he looked back and the fire had flowed out and taken the body. He went back and there was no body to be seen. Napela was the son's name and he lived in Pahala, Kau, in 1881.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_479"></A><A HREF="#fn_479"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A></FONT></p>  
<p>The struggle between rival schools of sorcery set up by the Pele worshipers is perhaps worked into the legends which show Hi&#8216;iaka fighting the evil mo&#8216;o, who are primarily spirits of the damp woodlands and ponds of water; or the legend of Pele's sister Na-maka-o-kaha&#8216;i, who may have been originally a water spirit in spite of the fiery nature of her various trans-formation forms as the story is told today; or in the strife between Pele and the woman of the mountain top, Poliahu, for the fertile land of Hawaii; or in her fight with the amorous hog-man, Kamapua&#8216;a, whose gods are the storm signs inimical to fire. The legend of Puna-ai-koae and the demon wife carries the same implication. Of the three recorded versions, the Kamakau version is told to explain the origin of certain fishing customs and leaves the denouement incomplete. The Thrum and Westervelt versions, evidently from an identical source, stress the rivalry between the fire goddess and the water mo&#8216;o, whose images are set up in the heiau, one representing Haumea in her human form as Wali-nu&#8216;u, the other the goddess Kalamainu&#8216;u.</p>

<p><A NAME="page_194"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 194</FONT></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">STORY OF PUNAAIKOAE</h3>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">(<i>a</i>) <i>Kamakau version</i>. The mo&#8216;o woman Kalamainu&#8216;u lives in a cave at Makaleha in Laie, Waialua district, on Oahu. Going forth one day in search of a husband she finds the young Kauai chief Puna-ai-koae (Puna tropic-bird eater) surfing on the waves of Ka-lehua-weha, lures him to her own board and carries him away to Kaena point, where they land and, ascending the Waianae mountains to Pu&#8216;u-ka-pele, descend to the stream of Wailea on the west side of which her cave is still to be seen today. After several months of love making and feasting Puna longs again for surf riding and his wife fetches a board from the corner of the cave but warns him against speaking to anyone while he is away. On his way to the sea two relatives of the mo&#8216;o woman, Hinalea and Aikilolo, hail him and warn him of his wife's true nature. They tell him that the board he carries is in reality her mo&#8216;o tongue and that unless he can escape he must ultimately perish. He returns secretly to the cave and spies upon his wife in her mo&#8216;o form. Because of her nature as a spirit she knows what has happened and prepares to eat him, but since he shows no fear when she shows him her terrible forms, she forgives him and goes forth to slay his informants. They evade her for a time by creeping into a crack of the sea floor. Kuao and Ahilea tell her how to set a trap to catch them. Thus the basket trap for catching hinalea fish came to be invented, and Kalamainu&#8216;u is still an aumakua for catching hinalea fish in that vicinity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_480"></A><A HREF="#fn_480"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A></p>  
<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Emerson and Westervelt versions</i>. Puna is surfing at Waimanalo, Waikiki, when he encounters the mo&#8216;o-woman and is lured by her to Molokai and hidden away in her cave home. Her brother Hinale warns him as he is going to join the surfers, and he peeps in and sees his wife feeding on spiders and their webs. He pacifies her wrath and watches his chance to escape to the pit of Pele and put himself under the protection of his former wife's (Walinu&#8216;u's) family. He pretends to thirst after the ice-cold waters of Poliahu and gives his wife a gourd to fill which he has secretly punched with holes. During her absence he makes</FONT></p>

<p><FONT SIZE="-1">his escape. Kiha-wahine summons the mo&#8216;o gods and fills the pit of Pele with their phlegm, but the place sacred to Ka-moho-ali&#8216;i is unharmed and the mo&#8216;o gods are many of them consumed with fire and Kiha-wahine is obliged to escape to the pond called Loko-aka (Shadow pond). Ounauna is the fellow who shows her how to make the fish basket to trap Hinale.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_481"></A><A HREF="#fn_481"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A></FONT></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>The story of the escape from a cannibal wife is widespread throughout Polynesia, often connected with the trick of sending the monster on a fruitless errand (generally after water) in order to gain time for escape. The widespread motives of death by feeding with hot stones or by drawing up to a height on a rope and then cutting the rope, common in southern Polynesia (and throughout Africa), are not found in Hawaii, nor are the tricks, also well known, of substituting a dummy for the body or providing a speaking substitute. These are no doubt later embellishments. On the other hand, there is little doubt that the characteristically Polynesian motive of the woman who has a back which opens and devours all the fish while her family sleep was once a part of Hawaiian stories of a demon wife.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_482"></A><A HREF="#fn_482"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1"><i>Maori</i>. (a) Ruru-teina is on his way home with his wife when he goes to fetch fire and is seized by a reptile-woman named Ngarara-hu-ora. The rat people tell him that she is not a woman; then, to escape her revenge, they run, one into a stone, the other into the gable of the house. While the demon tries to get at them, Ruru runs away and with the help of his brother succeeds in burning the reptile-woman in a house prepared for the purpose and returns home to his wife.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_483"></A><A HREF="#fn_483"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A></p>

<p>(d) Houmea is the wife of Uta, whom she leaves to starve while she swallows his whole catch and pretends that fairies have taken it. She swallows her children, but they carry, one a carved staff, the other a barbed spear, and at their father's incantation come out alive. To escape her Uta sends her for water, dries up the springs by incantations so that she may have far to go, and escapes with the boys in the canoe, after directing the various parts of the establishment to answer for him when she calls. She pursues, is fed with fish, and finally with a hot stone which causes her death. The name Houmea is today applied to evil women, adulteresses, and thieves who dwell among men. Tu-tawake is her child, with whom come evil and daring.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_486"></A><A HREF="#fn_486"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A></p>

Haumea follows swimming. He kills her by pouring red-hot stones down her throat under pretence of food.

He objects to her food and, pretending to go away to prepare some for himself, returns to his companions and makes fun of her.

<p>Three other folktales of demon wife or husband have been collected in Hawaii, most of them from the island of Maui, where an excellent story of a pursuing head was early set down by a student at the Lahainaluna school.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">STORY OF THE DEMON HEAD</h3>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">Mahikoa and his brother-in-law Pilikana go up to a place in the woods above Kaana-pali on Maui called Wahikuli to cut battens for a house.

Pilikana flees, the head (po&#8216;o) pursues, calling out to him to wait and they will go home together.

<p>The Hawaiian Kalamainu&#8216;u legend has a close variant in the Tahitian story of the cannibal woman Nona, grandmother by her daughter Hina of Hema, father of Kaha&#8216;i, and of Pu&#8216;a (Puna) who is the Maori Punga, ancestor of the eel family and their kin in the sea. As such it is associated with the Aikanaka-Hina cycle localized in the same district on the island of Maui from which most of the demon-wife folktale versions have been drawn. On the other hand it is connected with the Oahu story of how Haumea in the person of Walinu&#8216;u (Papa) lived with Makea (Wakea) up Kalihi valley on Oahu and saved him from death by entering into a tree. Puna is identified with Wali-nu&#8216;u's lover, and the two kupua women, Kalamainu&#8216;u and Haumea, are shown as rivals in love. They fight with their kupua bodies, fire and water, but their human bodies also enter into the scrap, as, according to Thrum, their images are represented in the heiau, Walinu&#8216;u with a broken nose and Kalamainu&#8216;u with blinded eyes. The wrappings of yellow tapa seem to indicate that they belong to the Kane worship.</p>
