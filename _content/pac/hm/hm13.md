# Children of the Gods

### THE PELE MYTH

HAWAIIANS believe that the volcano at Kilauea is inhabited by a family
of fire gods presided over by the goddess Pele who governs the
activities of lava flows. A kahuna brother Moho (Ka-moho-ali‘i), two
sisters, Pele and Hi‘iaka (Hi‘iaka-i-ka-poli-o-Pele), and a hump-backed
brother named Kamakaua (Ke-o-ahi-kamakaua) are said to compose the
original Pele family, all further additions being purely mythical.
Traditional lists of volcano deities compiled by Ellis, Kalakaua, and
Westervelt name at least five brothers and eight sisters, the brothers
associated with the phenomena of thunderstorms and volcanic activities,
the sisters with cloud forms, as translated by Ellis, who also uses the
old *t* sound which later informants replace with a *k*.

The Pele myth is believed to have developed in Hawaii where it is
closely associated with aumakua worship of the deities of the volcano,
with the development of the hula dance. and with innumerable stories in
which odd rock or cone formations are ascribed to contests between Pele
and her rivals, human or divine. The myth narrates the migration or
expulsion of Pele from her distant homeland and her effort to dig for
herself a pit deep enough to house her whole family in cool comfort or
to exhibit them in their spirit forms of flame and cloud and other
volcanic phenomena. She approaches the

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

group from the northwest, tries island after island without success, and
finally settles on Hawaii at the crater Moku-aweoweo (Land of burning).
Her brother Ka-moho-ali‘i and other male relatives assist in or
accompany the journey. The only female companion noted in the story is
her pet little sister Hi‘iaka. The myth continues at great length with
an account of Pele's affair in spirit form with a handsome young chief
of Kauai of whom she is enamored and whom she determines to have for a
husband; of sending her sister to fetch him to share her home on Hawaii;
of jealousy of her faithful messenger; and of the sister's consequent
defiance.

The Pele myth therefore falls into two parts: (1) the establishment of
Pele's home at the volcano on Hawaii, (2) the sending for her lover
Lohiau to share this home. In the first myth Pele is the dominant
character, in the second her sister Hi‘iaka has assumed that position.

### PELE LEGENDS

(*a*) *Migration legend*. Pele is one of a family of seven sons and six
daughters born to Haumea and her husband Moemoe (Moemoe-a-aulii), all
distinguished figures in old legend. Pele is very beautiful with a back
straight as a cliff and breasts rounded like the moon. She longs to
travel and, tucking her little sister born in the shape of an egg under
her armpit, hence called Hiiaka-i-ka-poli-o-Pele (-in the armpit of
Pele), she seeks her brother Ka-moho-ali‘i. He gives her the canoe of
their brother Whirlwind (Pu-ahiuhiu) with Tide (Ke-au-lawe or
Ke-au-miki) and Current (Ke-au-ka) as paddlers, and promises to follow
with other members of the family. She goes by way of Polapola,
Kuaihelani "where Kane hides the islands," and other islands inhabited
by gods (Mokumanamana) to Ni‘ihau, island of the chiefess Fire-thrower
(Ka-o-ahi), where she is handsomely entertained. Thence she visits Kauai
and appears in the midst of a hula festival in the form of a beautiful
woman. Falling desperately in love with the young Kauai chief Lohiau,
she determines to take him for a husband. Passing southeast from island
to island, on each of which she attempts to dig a home in which she can
receive her lover, she comes finally to Hawaii and

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

there is successful in digging deep without striking water, an element
inimical to her fiery nature. <span id="fr_422"></span>[4](#fn_422)

\(b\) *Expulsion version*. Pele is born to Kane-hoa-lani and Haumea in
Kuaihelani. She sticks so close to Lono-makua, the fire god, as to cause
a conflagration (or, as in the Aukelenuiaiku story, makes love to her
sister's husband) and her older sister Na-maka-o-kaha‘i, called "a sea
goddess," drives her away. She takes passage in the canoe Honua-i-a-kea
with her little sister carried in her armpit and accompanied by her
brothers Ka-moho-ali‘i, Kane-milo-hai, Kane-apua, and others, and
arrives at the Hawaiian group by way of the northwestern shoals. There
Kane-milo-hai is left on one islet as an outguard and Kane-apua on
another, but Pele pities this last younger brother and picks him up
again. A group of songs relate the relentless pursuit of the party by
the older sister until the two sisters en-counter each other in
Kahiki-nui on the island of Maui and Pele's body is torn apart and the
fragments heaped up to form the hill called Ka-iwi-o-Pele (The bones of
Pele) near Kauiki, while her spirit takes flight to the island of Hawaii
and finds a permanent home on Hawaii. <span
id="fr_423"></span>[5](#fn_423)

\(c\) *Flood version*. Pele is born in Kapakuela, a land to the
southwest, "close to the clouds," and her parents are Kane-hoa-lani and
Ka-hina-li‘i, her brothers Ka-moho-ali‘i and Kahuila-o-ka-lani. By her
husband Wahieloa (Wahialoa) she has a daughter Laka and a son named
Menehune. Pele-kumu-honua entices her husband from her and Pele travels
in search of him. With her comes the sea, which pours from her head over
the land of Kanaloa (Kahoolawe), never before so inundated, and her
brothers chant,

"A sea! a sea!  
Forth bursts the sea,  
Bursts forth over Kanaloa (Kahoolawe),  
The sea rises to the hills. . . ."

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "Thrice" (according to the chant) the sea floods
the land, then recedes. These floodings are called
The-sea-of-Ka-hina-li‘i. <span id="fr_424"></span>[6](#fn_424)

(*d*) *Unnatural birth version*. Pele's father is the man-eater
Ku-waha-ilo who dwells in the far-off heavens. Haumea, her mother,
belongs to the Pali (cliff) family. Two daughters are born,
Na-maka-o-kaha‘i from the breasts of Haumea, Pele from the thighs.
Brothers are born; Ka-moho-ali‘i from the top of the head of Haumea,
Kane-hekili (Thunder) from the mouth, Kauila-nui (Lightning) from the
eyes, and other children (from four to forty sisters) from various parts
of Haumea. Hi‘iaka is born in the shape of an egg and cherished as
Pele's favorite. <span id="fr_425"></span>[7](#fn_425)

(*d'*) Papa and Wakea are the parents of Pele, Ka-moho-ali‘i, and Kapo.
Kapo is born from Papa's eyes, Kamohoali‘i from her head as a
mist-crowned precipice. <span id="fr_426"></span>[8](#fn_426)

 

Local elaboration of the migration story describes in detail the
localities on each island where Pele pursued her digging
activities. <span id="fr_427"></span>[9](#fn_427) A famous dance song
records the successive steps of Pele's advance from island to island,
beginning:

The blaze trembles,  
Bursts out above, below,  
The spade rattles in the cleft below.  
"What god is this digging?"  
"It is I, Pele,  
Digging a pit on Ni‘ihau." <span id="fr_428"></span>[10](#fn_428)

\[paragraph continues\] As the oral recitation proceeds, recounting
Pele's migration, old Hawaiian story tellers insert a song chanted in
the oil (singing) style, such as the famous "Coming of Pele" describing
the building of the canoe, the journey from the homeland, the family
group who accompany Pele, their arrival on Hawaii, and their apotheosis
at the volcano. "Kahiki" and "Polapola" as they occur in the song are
today referred

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

to the Society group, from which lands the party of gods is represented
as migrating.

'The household of Pele and her company,

On the canoe were Ku and Lono.'  
It came to land, rested there,  
The island rose before them, Hi‘iaka stepped ashore seeking for increase
of divinity,  
Went and came to the house of Pele.  
The gods of Kahiki burst into lightning flame with roar and tumult,  
Lightning flames gushed forth,  
Burst forth with a roar." <span id="fr_429"></span>[11](#fn_429)

### HI‘IAKA MYTH

*Emerson version*. Pele has made her home with her brothers and sisters
at the crater of Mokuaweoweo. She falls into a deep sleep during which
her spirit leaves her body and, following the sound of the nose-flute
(Kani-ka-wi) and the whistle (Kani-ka-wa), arrives at the island of
Kauai while a hula dance is in progress. She takes the form of a
beautiful woman and wins the young chief Lohiau as her husband. Upon
leaving him on the third (or ninth) night, she bids him await her
messenger to bring him to the house she is making ready for him. \[In
Rice's version this meeting precedes her digging experiments from island
to island.\] In the meantime, her faithful sister has watched over her
inert body and is relieved to see it return to consciousness. Pele calls
for a messenger and Hi‘iaka-i-ka-poli-o-Pele is the only one of her
household brave enough to face the dangers of the way. The girl demands
and is given the powers of a god in order to pass through the ordeal in
safety. Entrusting her beloved lehua groves and her friend Hopoe to the
care of her sister and receiving her sister's last commands not to
indulge in embraces on the way and to return within forty days, she sets
forth on her perilous journey.

On the way she provides herself with women companions. Her old nurse
Pau-o-palai (Skirt of palai fern) accompanies her as far as Kohala,
where she remains with her husband Paki‘i until the girl's return. A
half goddess named Wahine-omao (Thrush-woman),

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

daughter of Kai-palaoa and Puna-hoa, is the only one who makes the
entire journey with her. Another girl, Papulehu, joins her on the way
but has not the spiritual qualifications to survive even the first of
the dangers encountered.

Choosing the upland path across Hawaii, the party must first exterminate
the evil mo‘o who make the way dangerous. With the help of the war gods
Kuliliaukaua and Kekako‘i and the shell-conch blowers Kamaiau,
Kahinihini, and Mapu, Hi‘iaka fights and overcomes a number of these
monsters. The mo‘o woman Panaewa, who impedes her way in the form first
of fog (kino-ohu), then of sharp rain (kino-au-awa), then of a
candle-nut (kukui) tree, she entangles the mo‘o and her followers, the
Na-mu and Na-wa in a growth of vine \[or engulfs them in the sea\]. Two
mo‘o, Kiha and Pua‘a-loa (Long hog), are caught in a flood of lava,
where their forms may be seen to this day. The shark at the mouth of
Waipio valley who seizes swimmers crossing the bay is met and slain.
Mo‘olau, chief of the jumping mo‘o (mahiki) in the land of Mahiki-waena,
is defied, his followers put to rout, and the wounds bound up of two men
the mo‘o have mangled. Two mo‘o, Pili and Noho, who make travelers pay
toll at the bridge across the Wailuku river, are rent from jaw to jaw
and the way opened for free traffic. The prudish ghost god
Hinahina-ku-i-ka-pali, who objects to the girls swimming naked across
the stream Honoli‘i while holding their clothing above their heads, is
reproved and put to silence.

Crossing to Maui, the girls avoid the attentions of the paddlers
Pi‘i-kea-nui and Pi‘i-kea-iki and proceed along the coast. A maimed
spirit named Manamana-i-aka-luea is seen dancing the hula mu‘umu‘u
(maimed) and her spirit nature is tested by throwing a hala fruit and
seeing her figure instantly vanish. Omao catches the spirit and the
girls restore it to its lifeless body. Refused hospitality at the home
of the chief Olepau \[or Kaulahea\] in Iao valley, Hi‘iaka avenges the
insult by catching his second soul, as it goes fluttering about while he
lies sleeping, and dashing it against the rock Pahalele near Waihe‘e. At
the advice of the kahuna Kuakahi-mahiku, the chief's friends attempt to
overtake and conciliate Hi‘iaka but are tricked by concealing
transformations. At the hill Pulehu the two take the shapes of an old
woman and child with a dog; at Kalaula‘ola‘o,

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

of girls stringing blossoms; at Kapua in Kaanapali they appear as women
braiding mats for a new house. \[In Rice's version other incidents occur
and the chief is restored to life.\]

Crossing next to Molokai, the girls choose the route along the dangerous
windy side of the island and make the passage to Oahu from Kaunakakai.
The single adventure described is the banishing of the lawless mo‘o
tribe who have robbed women of their husbands, and the slaying of the
mo‘o woman Kikipua who has stolen Oloku‘i from his wife Papaua, deserted
her own husband Hakaaano, and made a false bridge of her tongue to
destroy travelers. Hi‘iaka makes use of her skirt (pau) as a bridge,
over which the girls pass safely. The mourning women whose husbands have
been destroyed by the mo‘o band she however reproves for indulging in
useless hysteria.

Again choosing the rocky side of the island on Oahu, Hi‘iaka addresses
chants to the rocks Maka-pu‘u and Malei, whom she recognizes as her own
supernatural relatives; greets Pohakuloa at Ka-ala-pueo (The owl road);
and crushes the evil mo‘o Mokoli‘i at Kualoa. Kauhi, "with eye-sockets
moist with the dripping dew from heaven," wishes to go with her and,
when she refuses his company, struggles up to a crouching position. So
his form may be seen today along the rock wall of Kahana. At Kahipa she
reproves Puna-he‘e-lapa and Pahipahi-alua for slipping away without a
greeting. At Kehuahapu‘u she listens to the sound of the sea, notices
the uki plant, and admires the beauty of Waialua. At the plain near
Lauhulu she chants the praises of the mountain Kaala. At Kaena point she
apostrophizes its huge boulders and begs the Rock-of-Kauai, left at sea
when Maui's fishline broke, to send her a canoe to cross to Kauai. It
was from this point that her sister had listened to the music which
lured her across the channel to Lohiau's feast.

The restoration of Lohiau takes place on Kauai. Arrived on that island,
the girls are entertained at the house of the chief Malae-ha‘a-koa,
whose lameness they have cured, and learn of the death of Lohiau out of
grief over the disappearance of the beautiful woman who came to him at
the hula dance. Two women of Honopu, Kilioe-i-kapua and Kalana-mai-nu‘u,
relatives of Kilioe, have stolen his body from the place where his
sister Ka-hua-nui had laid it, and hidden it in an inaccessible cave
high up

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

on the cliff Kalalau \[but in some versions Kilioe is Lohiau's sister
and the hider herself of the body\]. Hi‘iaka catches the fluttering
spirit and destroys the two Honopu women by means of an incantation. She
and Omao scale the cliff and for ten days, while the people below dance
the hula, she recites the chants useful to restore a spirit to its body.
At the end of this time Lohiau lives and all three descend on a rainbow
and purify themselves in the ocean.

The return voyage is now to be undertaken. Meanwhile the forty days'
limit set by Pele for the journey has been already covered and more
delays are still before them. Between Kauai and Oahu the shark gods Kua
and Kahole-a-Kane and the sea goddess Moana-nui-ka-lehua raise a storm
to prevent the match between their divine relative Pele and a mere
mortal like Lohiau. Hi‘iaka -chooses the overland route across the
island of Oahu while the other two round the island by canoe. At Pohakea
she climbs the ridge, looks across to her home on Hawaii, and voices a
bitter lament when she sees her beloved forests in flames and her friend
Hopoe wrapped in burning lava. Still true to her mission in spite of her
sister's betrayal, she chants a warning to the two alone in the canoe to
indulge in no love making. At Kou (Honolulu) the party is entertained by
the famous prophetess Pele-ula, a former lady-love of Lohiau, and
Hi‘iaka contends with her hostess in a kilu game for his possession, but
refuses to take advantage at that time of her success. \[Some accounts
state that at this point the three fashion visible bodies for themselves
out of spittle and, leaving these behind, go in their spirit bodies to
Hanauma bay, where they pass over to Maui.\]

The death of Lohiau takes place as a climax to Pele's jealousy. Without
waiting for an explanation from the two women who go ahead to acquaint
Pele with the story of their adventures, the angry goddess, furious at
the long delay, overwhelms them with fire. At this, Hi‘iaka, for the
first time and on the very edge of the crater in full view of her
sister, accepts Lohiau's embraces. Pele calls upon her sisters to
consume Lohiau, but they pity his beauty. She invokes her gods but they
call her unjust and blow away the flame, for which disloyalty she
banishes them to the barren lands of Huli-nu‘u; and that is how
Ku-pulupulu,

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Ku-moku-hali‘i, Ku-ala-nawao, Kupa-ai-ke‘e, and
Ku-mauna came to sail away and become canoe makers in other lands.
Finally Pele herself encircles the lovers with flame. Hi‘iaka has been
given a divine body and cannot be hurt, but Lohiau's body is consumed.

The second restoration of Lohiau to life follows. Hi‘iaka digs down
after him through the earth, passing at the first stratum of earth the
god of suicide, at the fourth the bodies of her two women friends, whom
she restores to life. She is about to rend the tenth layer when
Wahine-omao warns her against letting in the water upon her sister.
Lohiau's spirit, fluttering overseas, first to Kauai, where he bids his
friend Paoa seek Pele, then to La‘a in Kahiki, is caught by
Kane-milo-hai who has been left to guard the outposts of the group, and
restored to life. At first he is listless, but La‘a's bird messengers,
Plover and Turnstone, rouse him to interest in human affairs. At
Pele-ula's home he is reunited to Hi‘iaka. \[In Rice's version he is
sent back to Kauai by canoe. In one legend Omao becomes the wife of Lono
makua.\] <span id="fr_430"></span>[12](#fn_430)

 

The trance motive in the story of Pele's meeting with her lover depends
upon the idea that a spirit can wander away from a living body
(uhane-hele) and take the form of a second body (kinoho‘opaha‘oha‘o), in
which form it can carry on a life of its own apart from the body. The
theme is rationalized in the Laieikawai romance where Aiwohikupua dreams
of meetings with Laieikawai before he has ever seen her. In Tahiti it is
recorded that the young chiefess of Huahine remained in such a condition
for a month, during which time she met a lover who cherished and
protected her. <span id="fr_431"></span>[13](#fn_431) In a Marquesan
story two gods who desire the woman Teapo stop her breath and take her
ghost to Havaii where she hears songs sung which she can repeat after
she is restored to life. <span id="fr_432"></span>[14](#fn_432)

Few references to the Pele figure are to be found in other

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

groups. Gifford reports a Tongan female deity called Puakomopele with
pig head and woman's body who rules all the gods of Haapai and whose
sacred animal is the gecko. <span id="fr_433"></span>[15](#fn_433)
Allusions to Pele in Tahiti as deity of fire under the earth are said to
be due to late contact with the Hawaiian group:

The heat of the earth produced Pere (Conceiving heat), goddess of the
fire in the earth (atua vahine no te vera o te fenua). . . a blond woman
(vahine ‘ahu); then came Tama-ehu (Blond child) or Tama-tea. Fire was
those gods' agent of power; it obeyed them in the bowels of the earth
and in the skies. They were the chief fire gods. <span
id="fr_434"></span>[16](#fn_434)

. . . The great goddess Pere (Consuming heat) must be goddess of
spontaneous burning of the earth. Tama-'ehu (Blond child), the brother
of Pere, must be the god of heat in the nether lands. <span
id="fr_435"></span>[17](#fn_435)

. . . Pere has light down in the earth, without heat; above is the fire
ever burning. Awe-inspiring is the residence of Pere down in the earth,
great are her attendants that follow her below and above the surface of
the world. <span id="fr_436"></span>[18](#fn_436)

\[paragraph continues\] In Tahiti, the uninhabited islet of Tubai, most
northern of the group, is Pere's home during her visits to the
south. <span id="fr_437"></span>[19](#fn_437) Ti-‘ara‘a-o-Pere (Standing
place of Pele) is the name of the assembly ground of the district of
Tautira on Tai-a-rapu. <span id="fr_438"></span>[20](#fn_438)

Pele as goddess of volcanic fire is addressed in Hawaiian chants by a
number of names descriptive of volcanic activity. Pele-ai-honua (eater
of land) she is called because she destroys the land with her
flames. <span id="fr_439"></span>[21](#fn_439) Ai-laau (Wood eater) in
the Pele myths is an old volcano god who retreats before Pele or
surrenders to her the pit he has dug. <span
id="fr_440"></span>[22](#fn_440) According to Kamakau he is still an
aumakua of volcanic fire to whom dead

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

bodies are offered to become flame. <span
id="fr_441"></span>[23](#fn_441) Among the Maori, the descendant of
Maui-mua who came to New Zealand in the Tearatawhao canoe is literally
"Toi the wood eater" because he used raw fern-wood, the edible palm, and
young fern sprouts for food and knew nothing of fire and of cultivated
food. <span id="fr_442"></span>[24](#fn_442)

Pele's most common chant name is Pele-honua-mea (Pele of the sacred
earth), reminiscent of the Maori Para-whenua-mea, a name which Percy
Smith interprets as "effacement of nature due to the flood,"
Para-whenua-mea being, in Maori myth, the wife of Kiwa and mother of
"the great ocean of Kiwa" or the Pacific Ocean. <span
id="fr_443"></span>[25](#fn_443) Pele is the name by which the goddess
is worshiped in her fire body. Ka-ula-o-ke-ahi (The redness of the fire)
is her sacred name as a spirit. Kilinahi Kaleo, whom I here quote, gave
a start when I pronounced the name, and lowered his voice in answering
my question. Pele's name as a woman on earth, he told me, was
Hina-ai-ka-malama. Clearly the Maui mythologists of Hana have taken this
means to work into the Pele cycle their own famous Hina goddess of the
moon, to whose connection with the flood story and with the Kaha‘i-Laka
cycle is now added a place in the pantheon of the hula dance and the
romances woven about its festivals.
