<P>OHIA--LEHUA[1] is the native name for a tree which abounds in Puna, the region of the volcanic home of the goddess Pele. It has a continual growth of delicately shaded leaves. The young leaf, pink tinted, comes as the old leaf shading into gray falls from the tree. Flowers which are like beautiful red fringed balls are always found glorifying the varicolored foliage. Here honey-loving birds and bees find their best feeding-places.</P>

It was so old that it had become legendary and was known as "Ka laau o Pele" (The tree of Pele).

These sacrifices were supposed to appease the wrath of the goddess and assure the traveller safe passage through Pele's dominions.</P>
