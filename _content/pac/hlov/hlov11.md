### PELE'S TREE

OHIA--LEHUA\[1\] is the native name for a tree which abounds in Puna,
the region of the volcanic home of the goddess Pele. It has a continual
growth of delicately shaded leaves. The young leaf, pink tinted, comes
as the old leaf shading into gray falls from the tree. Flowers which are
like beautiful red fringed balls are always found glorifying the
varicolored foliage. Here honey-loving birds and bees find their best
feeding-places.

The ohia forests grow abundantly and rapidly on lava even recently
thrown out by the eruptions from Pele's lake of fire. The ohia roots
seem

to find food and drink, where the numerous cracks of a lava field open
in every direction, and vie with the tree ferns in making life take the
place of the desolation caused by the volcanic floods.

About half way between the city of Hilo and the volcano Kilauea, there
stood for many, many years an old ohia tree. It was so old that it had
become legendary and was known as "Ka laau o Pele" (The tree of Pele).
Whenever a native came near this tree, he began to search for certain
leaves or fruits which he could lay beneath the tree as an offering
before he dared to try to pass beyond. These sacrifices were supposed to
appease the wrath of the goddess and assure the traveller safe passage
through Pele's dominions.
