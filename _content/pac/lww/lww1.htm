<P>[T<SMALL>HE</SMALL> following is the teaching of Moihi Te Matorohanga (who will be referred to in the future as 'the Sage'), of Wai-rarapa, East Coast of New Zealand, on the subject of the Maori College, in which the young lads who shewed a disposition towards learning, and had been observed to be accomplished in telling stories, etc., were taught by the old Priests (or <I>Tohungas</I>) all that tended towards making them accomplished in the higher knowledge that was necessary to the chiefs and priests.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This teaching was divided into two branches as follows:&#8212;</P>

<P ALIGN="center">1. Te Kauwae-runga&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Te Kauwae-raro</P>

<P>(the simple translation of which is, the upper-jaw, and the lower-jaw). These branches were also sometimes designated, Te Kauhanga-runga, and Te Kauhanga-raro.<A NAME="page_79_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_79_note_*">*</A> The expressions had a clear meaning to the Maoris, the first representing everything pertaining to the gods, the heavens, the origin of all things, the creation of man, the science of astronomy, and the record of time, etc. The second (Te Kauwae-raro) deals with the history, properly so called, of the people, their genealogies, migrations, the <I>tapu</I>, and all knowledge pertaining to terrestrial matters. We may thus say that the first represents 'Celestial things,' the second 'Terrestrial things'; though, as will be seen, the distinction is not always adhered to.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to a clear understanding of the Sage's teaching in reference to the Whare-w&#257;nanga, it is necessary to know a good deal of his other teachings&#8212;which follows after this chapter&#8212;on the Kauwae-runga. So far as possible the notes will aid in this.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meaning of the words Whare-w&#257;nanga is somewhat difficult to express shortly in English; but probably the nearest meaning is, the 'house of learning,' or 'house of teaching,' with the understanding that the higher learning is meant&#8212;in some cases esoteric learning. Whare, of course, is a house, a building.<A NAME="page_80_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_80_note_*">*</A> <I>W&#257;nanga</I>, means the higher and sacred knowledge, and to recite that knowledge&#8212;it is, in fact, very similar to the meaning of <I>Veda</I> in the Sanskrit, as used in the name of the Hindu sacred books, the Rig-veda-Samhita.<A NAME="page_80_fr_dagger"></A><A HREF="#page_80_note_dagger">&#8224;</A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some parts the Whare-w&#257;nanga is called Whare-kura (where <I>Kura</I> has the same meaning as w&#257;nanga) and Whare-maire. But it will be seen later on that the Sage makes a considerable distinction between the first and the last, and rarely mentions the second, though that name is well-known to many tribes; and the late Mr. John White in his "Ancient History of the Maori," Vol. I., has described the Maori College under the name of Whare-kura.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Whare-w&#257;nanga was an extremely sacred institution, as will be seen by the Sage's description. Some of the tribes have preserved the principal names of these institutions right away from the original Fatherland&#8212;indeed, even from the Heavens themselves&#8212;down to their extinction in the middle of the nineteenth century. The Sage gives the following succession of houses used by his ancestors; but it does not profess to be a perfect list&#8212;only the more important being mentioned:&#8212;</P>

This was the original of all the Whare-w&#257;nanga, and the pattern from which subsequent ones were built, and from whence came all knowledge, brought from the twelfth heaven&#8212;Te Toi-o-nga-rangi&#8212;by the god T&#257;ne-matua; this was the temple of the Supreme God Io. It is said to have been situated in the Sun's path in the heavens, the name itself having that meaning.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. </TD><TD>Rangi-atea. This was another temple in the twelfth heaven, where were deposited the <I>whatu-kura</I> on the <I>Ahu-rewa</I>, or altar, the <I>whatu-kura</I> being the sacred stones connected with the teaching, and were in charge of the male and female guardian spirits (Whata-kura and Marei-kura<A NAME="page_81_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_81_note_*">*</A>) at that part of the twelfth heaven which was the <I>marae</I>, or court yard, or plaza of Rangiatea, named Rau-roha. Rauroha means a wide space, as of the heavens. Rangi-atea, describes the complete absence of cloud in the skies. The Sage declared this to be "the teaching of the Whare-w&#257;nanga, and must not be questioned."</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. </TD><TD>Tawhiri-rangi. This was the temple&#8212;not necessarily a Whare-w&#257;nanga&#8212;in which the spirits of mankind, who were deemed worthy to ascend to the presence of Io, the Supreme God in the twelfth heaven, were purified before their admittance into that heaven. It was situated in the first heaven, below the summit (probably), the entrance to which, was named Pu-motomoto, and opened downward into space. The door of departure of the spirits upwards to Io from this heaven was named Uru-rangi. [Entering-heaven.]</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. </TD><TD>Whakamoe-ariki, was a sacred house (probably) in the twelfth heaven, where dwelt the minor gods, Rua-tau, Aitu-pawa, Rehua, and the spiritual beings named Te Tini-o-Pono-aua (the Pono-aua tribe), who were the servants of the Apas, or messengers of the gods.<A NAME="page_81_fr_dagger"></A><A HREF="#page_81_note_dagger">&#8224;</A> The three first named were the guardians of the heavenly treasures, and, from their association with Io, the Supreme God, were considered to rank above the other gods.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. </TD><TD>Whare-kura, was a temple situated in Rangi-tamaku, or the first above the lowest heaven (according to one description), and which served as the prototype of the terrestrial temples; from it succeeding temples took their generic name of Whare-kura. In this place were suspended the (emblems of the) teaching of T&#257;ne, together with the <I>whatu</I> or sacred stones brought down by him from the twelfth heaven. The

teacher in this house was Uru-te-ngangana (also Nuku-te-aio and Rua-i-te-pukenga).<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[In another place, the Sage states that the second temple named Whare-kura was situated "at Te Hono-i-wairua (the gathering place of spirits) at Tawhiti-pa-mamao (the Fatherland) in the spot where the teaching of the Whare-w&#257;nanga originated," (i.e., where man was first taught the doctrines brought down from Heaven by T&#257;ne) "and where were created the land, the great ocean, the forests; the plants of the land, the fish of the sea, according to their kinds, the birds of each kind, the reptiles whether of the land or the sea, and over which temple presided the ancestor Uru-te-ngangana" (who was one of the gods).] It rather seems as if some confusion exists as to whether or not there were two temples of this name.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. </TD><TD>Tangi-te-wiwini, was another temple situated in the ancient Fatherland of Irihia, at Tawhiti-pa-mamao, at Te Hono-i-wairua. It is also said another temple, named Te Rangi-tapu, at Kaupeka nui, was built in the ancient Fatherland of Irihia, or Hawaiki-nui.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. </TD><TD>Wharau-rangi, was another temple built in Irihia; the teacher was M&#257;ui-mua,<A NAME="page_82_fr_*"></A><A HREF="#page_82_note_*">*</A> assisted by others. From the fact of M&#257;ui-mua being the priest, it is probable this temple was built after the first migrations of the people from the Fatherland&#8212;the name Irihia probably covering more than one country.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. </TD><TD>Takapau-rangi. In this house Taka-waerangi and others were the teachers, but it is not stated where it was situated, but, probably in some of the lands the people resided in for more or less lengthy periods on their migrations from Irihia, or Hawaiki-nui, to the islands of the Pacific.</TD></TR>

This <I>whare-w&#257;nanga</I> was a cave (or had a cave attached to the building) and the teaching under Whare-patari was removed from number eleven to this place.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in these temples, colleges, or houses of learning, that the priests of old taught the young men of their particular tribes, with the constant admonition never to depart from what they learned, nor to allow other subjects than those taught by the tribal priests to be introduced into the colleges. The Sage states that youths from other tribes might be taught therein; in which probability he means the series of tribes of the East Coast who all, more or less, are related to the descendants of the crew of the "Takitimu" canoe that came here about 1350, and also to the original <I>tangata-whenua</I> people, about whom we shall learn later. It would seem from the difference in the teachings found in other tribes that this is so.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be noted that all the teachings of the Sage on the subject of the Whare-w&#257;nanga are here brought under one heading in the translation, though the sources of the information are to be found scattered through his various teachings (in Maori) in other parts which will follow this. We may now leave the Sage to tell his own story. He died in 1884, aged about eighty years.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="6">I</FONT>N February, 1865, Rei, addressing Te Matorohanga said, "O Moi Explain to us about the Whare-w&#257;nanga and its teachings." The Sage replied, "What of the Whare-w&#257;nanga indeed! It is similar to the [teaching of the modern] church; do not we wash ourselves in the pots used for cooking [nowadays]?"<A NAME="fr_1"></A><A HREF="#note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attention! O Sirs! Listen!: There was no one universal system of teaching in the Whare-w&#257;nanga. Each tribe has its own priests, its own college, and its own methods. From tribe to tribe this was so the teaching was diverted from the true teaching by the self-conceit of the priests which allowed of departure from their own doctrines to those of other Whare-w&#257;nanga. My word to you is: Hold steadfastly to our teaching: leave out of consideration that of other [tribes]. Let their descendants adhere to their teaching, and you to ours; so that if you err, it was we [your relatives] who declared it unto you [and you are not responsible]; and if you are in the right, it is we who shall leave to you this valuable property [and should have the credit thereof]. The omissions in our discourse, you will be able to adjust, whether it be of the foundations of knowledge or that which proceeds from it. The omissions in my teaching, or innovations, the variations, the interruptions, or divergence from the main argument or

true story, Paratene Te Okawhare<A NAME="fr_2"></A><A HREF="#note_2"><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></A> and Nepia Pohuhu<A NAME="fr_3"></A><A HREF="#note_3"><FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT></A> will be able to supply. Their teaching is the same [as mine]&#8212;one of them can adjust this. My wish was, if Te Ura had consented, there should have been only one house of teaching for all of us together; in that case there would have been no trouble, for one of us would have laid down the main line of teaching [and discourse thereon], whilst two would have listened in case of any divergence, and one of them would supplement it, or in case of the 'solution of continuity' the other would cause the discourse to flow again,<A NAME="fr_4"></A><A HREF="#note_4"><FONT SIZE=1>4</FONT></A> and to become reaffixed to the root of the subject, or supply any emissions. It was thus in the Whare-w&#257;nanga&#8212;not less than three teachers took part, not counting the many other <I>tohungas</I> (or priests) present. In this way all went properly. The <I>tauira</I> (or pupils)<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#note_5"><FONT SIZE=1>5</FONT></A> are not here considered, for unto them was poured out the properties (teaching) in the basket-of-knowledge.<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#note_6"><FONT SIZE=1>6</FONT></A> Their business was to listen, and to firmly fix in their hearts, in their very roots and origins, all they are taught, with also the strong desire to retain it all.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Whare-w&#257;nanga is for use by those young men who are considered by their tribe to be suitable for learning; who are intelligent and alert, and display perseverance in learning what is taught them. It is those [alone] who are allowed to enter the Whare-w&#257;nanga. They have to undergo a preliminary teaching amongst their own tribe before entering. The house of teaching is for such cases, and for all tribes&#8212;not for a single tribe or for one or two only.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in constructing the Whare-w&#257;nanga let the site be outside the palisaded <I>pa</I>, and away from the village, or the food-cultivations, or the bird-preserves, or canoe-landing places, or distant from paths where men pass. This was done because the Whare-w&#257;nanga was a <I>whare-tapu</I>&#8212;a sacred house&#8212;and the sacredness extended to the <I>ahurewa</I>, or altar, the <I>marae</I>, or court, and the latrines; together with all those who took part in teaching and learning&#8212;all were extremely <I>tapu</I>. In case

<!------------------------page 86------------------------>

<A NAME="page_86"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 86</FONT></A>

the dedication <I>karakias</I> [prayers, incantations, etc.] only covered as far as the <I>paepae-awha</I>,<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#note_7"><FONT SIZE=1>7</FONT></A> it would not render the house sufficiently <I>tapu</I>; a house trodden by the feet of [ordinary] men [in such case] would not have sufficient <I>m&#259;na</I> [prestige, power, etc.]. Nothing that took place within the house during the teaching might be disclosed&#8212;it was sacred. The whole of the <I>marae</I> is <I>tapu</I>, as well as all belonging to a properly constituted Whare-w&#257;nanga.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sleeping houses, cooking houses, store houses of every kind together with the cooks must all be outside the sacred <I>marae</I>; and only those who are officiating in the Whare-w&#257;nanga (or Whare-maire, as some call it) may enter therein. No one from outside may enter either the <I>marae</I> or the house, lest they be stricken with <I>mumutu</I><A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#note_8"><FONT SIZE=1>8</FONT></A> (or as some call it <I>take-whenua</I>). No woman who has cohabited with a man may cook food for the staff, or even enter the <I>marae</I>; the reason being that she has a bloody flux [and is hence impure].<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#note_9"><FONT SIZE=1>9</FONT></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is the course adopted in the construction of the Whare-w&#257;nanga: The foundation of the house must be carefully cleared and swept. This done, a commencement is made with the <I>pou-tua-rongo</I>, or rearmost pillar, then the <I>pou-toko-manawa</I>, or central pillar, and lastly the pillar by the door. These three pillars are kept to their proper height by the <I>aho-tatai</I>, or cord stretched from rear to front; the rear pillar is four fingers breadth lower than the centre one, and the latter the same below the top of the front pillar. It is the same with the floor of the house, the rear must be four fingers breadth below the front [and, adds the Scribe, the width of the building must be four fingers breadth greater in front than in rear, and the opening of the doorway four fingers wider on the inside of the jambs than outside. This is supposed to allow smoke to escape, and the dimensions have been decided on from experience. All measurements are always made inside the house. For particulars of an ordinary Maori house see 'Journal Polynesian Society,' Vol. V., p. 145, and they do not differ much from a Whare-w&#257;nanga, which averaged about forty feet long by twenty feet wide, and fifteen to twenty feet high].</P>

<P>

<!------------------------page 87------------------------>

<A NAME="page_87"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 87</FONT></A>

</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the process of building, before placing the rearmost pillars in the ground, there are deposited in the hole three <I>whatus</I>,<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#note_10"><FONT SIZE=1>10</FONT></A> of which Rakai-ora [emblematical for a green lizard] is the first; or if none are at hand, then the 'son of Pekerau,' a <I>tuatara</I>.<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#note_11"><FONT SIZE=1>11</FONT></A> If that could not be procured, the 'son of Arawaru,'<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#note_12"><FONT SIZE=1>12</FONT></A> the <I>karearea</I> [or sparrow-hawk] was used [all these things have to be collected before the home is started, otherwise it would be a <I>whare-aitua</I>, or house of ill omen&#8212;says the Scribe]. Before placing them the whole, the three <I>whatus</I> were brought in a <I>kete</I> (basket), and a mat laid down in the middle of the <I>kauwhanga</I>, or passage down the centre of the house, when the second priest seized the <I>tuatara</I>, and the third priest placed them on the mat. After this the last priest repeated a <I>karakia</I>, or prayer, to <I>whakanoho</I>, or place the <I>whatus</I> in position on the mat. Two of the <I>whatus</I> are then placed in the hole, the <I>karearea</I> remaining. The green lizard and the <I>tuatara</I> having been buried, the post is placed in position, and when it is upright, the 'son of Arawaru' [see <A HREF="#note_12">note twelve</A>] is put by the first priest on top of the rearmost pillar, between it and the ridge pole. He

<!------------------------page 88------------------------>

<A NAME="page_88"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 88</FONT></A>

then commences his <I>karakia</I>, whilst all pull out a few hairs from their top-knots and place them on top of the <I>karearea</I>. The priest who has placed the <I>whatus</I>, then fills in the first of the earth, and after that other priests proceed with the work of building the house, by starting at the right hand comer of the walls. This concludes the ceremonious part connected with the building of the house.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the house is finished it is closed. Let me explain this further: At daylight the digging of the holes for the three pillars is started, with the ceremonies already described. When the three pillars have been firmly rammed, the ridge pole is placed in position; all must be finished before the sun rises above the horizon; after that the other work goes on. No woman is allowed in any part of this building [whilst it is building, or at any other time]. The day before the opening of the house, the priests alone are allowed within, in order to consecrate it, and to place some small <I>whatus</I>, or stones [see <A HREF="#note_41">note forty-one</A>], at the rearmost pillar; these stones are to be fed to the pupils who are to be taught the <I>w&#257;nanga</I> (or syllabus). This part of the house is called the Ahurewa or (most) sacred spot or altar.<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#note_13"><FONT SIZE=1>13</FONT></A> Let this be quite clear: The <I>tu&#257;hu</I> (or ordinary altar) is outside&#8212;not in the house. There are two (proper) sites for the <I>tu&#257;hu</I>, one near the latrine,<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#note_14"><FONT SIZE=1>14</FONT></A> one by side of a tomb&#8212;those are the only proper sites. The reason of this is lest (the <I>tu&#257;hus</I>) should be desecrated by the approach of food, or by food being suspended near them.<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#note_15"><FONT SIZE=1>15</FONT></A> I have heard of <I>tu&#257;hus</I> being placed in other spots. This is correct; but in that case they are used only for the <I>uruuru-tapu</I> [where witchcraft is taught, or where the umbilical cord, and hair when cut, is deposited], or as places where offerings are made to the gods, purification after touching a dead body, or removal of the <I>tapu</I> from anyone, etc.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case the two stones mentioned above cannot be procured [or in

The eight stones near the rearmost pillar, are used when the college breaks up in the month of Tapere-wai (September), and the session ends. The three stones at the <I>takuahi</I> are called 'Te Rongo-taketake<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#note_19"><FONT SIZE=1>19</FONT></A> of Rongo-marae-roa' [or the abiding-place-of-Rongo-marae-roa&#8212;god of all cultivated foods], and the eight stones are called 'Nga-whatu-mat&#257;ki.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Just before the final ceremony of 'breaking up' (I am informed by the Scribe) the pupils were told to stand on the mat, already referred to which was placed; just in front of the Ahurewa, or altar, under which mat the Whatu-kura (or Stones of Knowledge) were placed; and then all the priests gathered round them and placed their hands on the pupils heads, at the same time repeating an invocation to

ensure the permanence of what the pupils had learned. The Whatu-kura were sacred stones, and the Sage says in another place that they were white, or, failing them, sometimes of basalt of a reddish brownish color.] That is all about these stones.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the closing of the College, those taught by the priests were taken to the <I>paepae</I>, or bar, of the <I>turuma</I>, or latrine of the precincts, to remove from them the state of <I>tapu</I> induced by their sojourn in the College; and there the pupils bit the <I>paepae</I>, or bar.<A NAME="fr_20"></A><A HREF="#note_20"><FONT SIZE=1>20</FONT></A> After this all proceeded forth from the <I>marae</I> in a state of nudity; their usual clothes were deposited in the houses outside the <I>marae</I>. The clothes worn whilst in the Whare-w&#257;nanga were returned to that building by the priests [and deposited at the Ahurewa, or altar].<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#note_21"><FONT SIZE=1>21</FONT></A> This course was pursued every day whilst the teaching lasted. On the day of final departure from the precincts of the sacred <I>marae</I>, the priests took from the pupils a lock of their hair, the dirt of the feet, the spital, the perspiration from under the arms or between the thighs, and carried them to the rearmost pillar of the house and their buried them. All of this was done for fear that any such parts should be used in bewitching, or be a means by which the pupils were made to disclose any of the teachings they had acquired.<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#note_22"><FONT SIZE=1>22</FONT></A> After all this the pupils were taken to the water and ducked therein [as a cleansing from the <I>tapu</I>; there was near every village a <I>wai-tapu</I>, or sacred water, used in many ceremonies].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before the final departure of the classes from the sacred <I>marae</I> of the Whare-w&#257;nanga, they all stood in rank within the veranda (or porch) of the house, facing outwards. The door and the window<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#note_23"><FONT SIZE=1>23</FONT></A> were both closed; and the pupils were confined by the <I>paepae-awha</I>

<!------------------------page 91------------------------>

<A NAME="page_91"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 91</FONT></A>

[see <A HREF="#note_7">note 7</A>], or threshold of the porch, whilst the priests stood in the <I>marae</I> in order to address the pupils, the speeches being made by two of them. The addresses were, firstly, in the nature of commendation for good behaviour; secondly, exhortations to be careful how they carried themselves, and to guard what they had been taught; thirdly, a statement of the month in which they should return [to complete their courses]. This ended they marched, the priests leading, to the bounds of the <I>marae</I>, where they stood facing the direction of the door of the house; and then one of the priests taking a <I>kaunoti</I><A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#note_24"><FONT SIZE=1>24</FONT></A> made a sacred fire, whilst another priest recited a <I>karakia</I>. The reason of this proceeding was: if the sacred fire burnt, then Pu-oro-rangi or Rangi-whakarara sounded: the former being the rolling or rumbling thunder, the latter sharp claps of thunder. Only two claps would be heard.<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#note_25"><FONT SIZE=1>25</FONT></A> It was then that the pupils discarded their sacred garments and went forth from the <I>marae</I>, and only returned in the month that had been fixed for further teaching.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Each day the lessons commenced at daylight, after the priests had said a prayer, and ended at <I>pou-tu-maro</I>, or high noon; no teaching was carried on after that, for it was against Maori custom, says the Sage in another place.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, when the Whare-w&#257;nanga is opened for a session by the priests and pupils, when all are assembled within, the door is closed, and the following <I>karakia</I> is recited:&#8212;</P>

<P><SMALL>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here am I with an ardent desire, a perseverance equal to thine, O Ruatau!<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#note_26"><FONT SIZE=1>26</FONT></A><BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house is then purified by the priest by the following recitation; he stands at the rearmost pillar in the midst of the eight stones, those placed as already referred to; he waits until the first rays of the sun appear in the sky, and then commences as follows:&#8212;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[In this, and following <I>karakias</I>, I have attempted, with the aid of the Scribe, to render these exceedingly difficult, cryptic and elliptical compositions, in a form from which a slight understanding of the meaning may be gathered, with, however, very little satisfactory result. No one who has not tried it knows how difficult it is to render this class of composition into understandable English.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here the priest strikes the rearmost pillar of the house with his hand, and continues his <I>karakia</I> thus:&#8212;</P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Io-the-self-created!<BR></SMALL></P></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prayer of the priest ends here. This invocation is to purify the house and make it very <I>tapu</I>; to call on the gods to exert their god-like powers; on the Pou-tiri-ao [or guardian spirits, gods<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#note_35"><FONT SIZE=1>35</FONT></A>] and their powers; on the Apas [or messengers of the gods<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#note_35"><FONT SIZE=1>35</FONT></A>]; on the company of male gods; to make the ears and the understanding of the pupils receptive, and also to confirm and strengthen in their minds the matters taught in their presence.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Whare-w&#257;nanga is opened to the pupils, the first thing taught is that of the <I>uruuru-matua</I>. After all that course has been explained, then follows the branch called <I>uruuru-tipua</I>, and then finally the <I>uruuru-tawhito</I>. [These are the three divisions, or syllabus, into which the knowledge was divided. An explanation of them will be found in Chapter III.] When all these branches have been explained, it ends the teaching of the Kauwae-runga [or Celestial things], as taught to the young men.</P>

<P>

<!------------------------page 94------------------------>

<A NAME="page_94"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 94</FONT></A>

</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this the priest, or priests, stand forth, and enquire of the pupils which of the three branches of knowledge for that day the pupils desire to be taught. When this is settled, they are divided into classes, and those who desire to be taught the <I>uruuru-tawhito</I> [or third division] are taught first; on another day will be explained the <I>uruuru-tipua</I> [second class]. The third is occupied in the teaching of the <I>uruuru-matua</I> [first class]. And thus it continues until the end of the months appointed for this purpose.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[The Scribe explains, that these three classes are not taught in the same house, but in separate buildings adjacent to the main Whare-w&#257;nanga. It is here the pupils are taught by a priest told off for the purpose, the special branch the former have selected. The branch of knowledge called <I>uruuru-tawhito</I> is taught in the main building. Having passed in that subject the pupil passes to the other branches, and thus all acquire some knowledge of the branches. Before the end of the Session an examination is held by the priests, by cross-examining the pupils on the subjects they have learned. It is thus seen who are proficient, and these, in the final ceremony, are placed on the stones at the right-hand side of the rearmost pillar, whilst those less proficient, and who have to go through a second course, are placed on the left-hand stones, a process which causes these latter pupils much sorrow and trouble. Those who turn out to be dunces are placed on the stones by the fireplace. Hence arised the questions of old days, "Where were you purified?" (or passed, in this case.) If the one questioned has passed well, he replies, "By the side of the rearmost pillar, on such and such a stone"&#8212;for each of these stones had a name. It is thus known that the pupil passed a good examination. The lock of hair taken from the pupil, as described above, was buried under the stone alongside of which the pupil stood.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the three 'baskets of knowledge are opened,' and those parts appropriate to the Kauwae-raro [or Terrestrial things] are brought forth [disclosed]. The proceedings are similar to those in the teaching of the Kauwae-runga [Celestial things]; but in this second division are taught [the origin] of the 'spark of life' unto 'The Ao-marama' [World-of-light];<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#note_36"><FONT SIZE=1>36</FONT></A> that is, the genealogical descent from the twelve heavens,<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#note_37"><FONT SIZE=1>37</FONT></A> down to Papa-tua-nuku [the Earth, the Earth-mother] from whom [through T&#257;ne] was Hine-hau-one [the first woman] made. Papa-tua-nuku and Rangi-tuhaha were conjoined, and we now live

<!------------------------page 95------------------------>

<A NAME="page_95"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 95</FONT></A>

beneath the shade [or shelter] of the Kauwae-runga and the Kauwae-raro. This is outside of that branch of the subject, that developed to Whakaru-ai-moko, Hine-nui-te-po and Whiro-te-tipua,<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#note_38"><FONT SIZE=1>38</FONT></A> in Te Muri-wai-hou and Rarohenga.<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#note_39"><FONT SIZE=1>39</FONT></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were seven enterings [courses of lectures] in the Whare-w&#257;nanga each year; there were never more and never less. At the end of the last series the basket, in which the <I>whatus</I>&#8212;stones&#8212;which are given to the young men to swallow, was taken down from the rearmost pillar, where it hung, as has been explained. Some of the small stones are collected by the priests and then deposited in the recepticle of the two <I>whatus</I> that have been mentioned. These stones are in appearance, a <I>rehu</I> [white, like mist ? chalcedony]; a <I>huka-a-tai</I> [white, like sea-foam]; a <I>para-karaka</I> [reddish, or golden in colour, like the drupes of the <I>karaka</I> tree], or quartz pebbles, that is, a <I>hua-kuru</I>,<A NAME="fr_40"></A><A HREF="#note_40"><FONT SIZE=1>40</FONT></A> which is green in colour. These are all suspended in a basket at the rearmost pillar of the house. The priests take out the stones and place them in the pupils mouths, one to each.<A NAME="fr_41"></A><A HREF="#note_41"><FONT SIZE=1>41</FONT></A> The pupils are seated on the floor of the house&#8212;these pupils were those who had been taught the subjects pertaining to the <I>uruuru-matua</I>; those taught the other two subjects were placed on the four stones of the rearmost pillar, and then part of the incantation abstracted from that of Tupai<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#note_42"><FONT SIZE=1>42</FONT></A> was recited, the first

<A NAME="page_96"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 96</FONT></A>

priest, who directed the teaching, commenced it, and he who finally ended the teaching took up [<I>kapo</I><A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="#note_43"><FONT SIZE=1>43</FONT></A>] the recitation which is as follows:&#8212;</P>

<P><SMALL>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause to descend, outside, beyond<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[On these pupils, the power of retaining the acquired knowledge,<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cause to enter into these offspring, these sons,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient prized knowledge, the esoteric learning, O Io&#8212;e!<BR></SMALL></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the end of this part of the prayer is reached where the invocation [to the Supreme God Io] comes in, the pupil must swallow the stone, and immediately after the priest continues his prayer. This is it:&#8212;</P>

<P><SMALL>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be received, be possessed, be it affixed,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This esoteric knowledge; be firm in thy thoughts, nor deviote,<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the roots, and rootlets of thy thoughts.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May it grow, the fullness of this knowledge&#8212;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ancient knowledge, this original learning,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And be like thine, O Io-omnierudite e, i!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let ardent desire direct from thee, O Io-all-knowing! be his.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May thy inspiration grow [equal to thine]. O Ruatau-e!<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold firm, for ever, with desire towards the ways of Tu [the god of war]<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May he draw forth the abundant knowledge.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And entwine in his desires, the ways of Rongo [the god of peace]<BR>

<P>These are all the names of the months [<I>kaupeka</I>]; that is, the <I>marama</I> [moons]; there are other names given by other priests to these months [which are more generally used].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'properties' [teaching] in the 'baskets' called <I>uruuru-tipua</I> and <I>uruuru-tahito</I> contain also the <I>karakia makutu</I> [witchcraft spells] and other spells for destroying growing food or annulling the proceedings connected therewith, desired by [evil-minded] men; as well as all matters that may be desired for the well-being of man, or the tribes. But these [evil] works are not approved or taught in the Whare-w&#257;nanga; this [evil] branch of knowledge is only taught in the depths of the forest, by the side of a stream, or on the lower side of the <I>turuma</I> [or latrine]. [The same priests taught <I>Makutu</I>, as those of the Whare-w&#257;nanga, but in a different place]. This is done to avoid the presence of man. After the sun has disappeared beneath the horizon, and before it appears in the morning, the teaching ends [i.e., it is taught at

night]. But let my explanation of this subject end; for my knowledge does not include this branch of the properties of those 'baskets'; that is, we three, Pohuhu, Okawhare and myself. I have, however, seen two men, named Whinu and Te Maka, fed with excrement<A NAME="fr_47"></A><A HREF="#note_47"><FONT SIZE=1>47</FONT></A>; those men were taught at Nuku-taurua [Te Mahia Peninsula, East Coast, New Zealand], below the latrine of Kai-uku.<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="#note_48"><FONT SIZE=1>48</FONT></A> It was from that teaching they derived their [evil] name for that kind of work. They obtained the powerful spells, named "Taru-aitu," "Tunawhea," "Tuarowhea," "Maiki-nui," and "Maiki-roa."<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="#note_49"><FONT SIZE=1>49</FONT></A> This evil work ends in <I>huhu</I> and <I>haha</I> [emaciation and shortness of breath]&#8212;they&#8212;the spells&#8212;are what gives force to man-killing. But enough of this; let those who have been initiated into this work explain the foundation of it and its methods.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Sir! My word to you is this: Do not take up this branch of knowledge; it is the occupation of plebeans. All the evil teaching contained in the [branches of knowledge called] <I>uruuru-tipua</I> and <I>uruuru-tawhito</I>,<A NAME="fr_50"></A><A HREF="#note_50"><FONT SIZE=1>50</FONT></A> spring from Whiro [god of Hades, of evil] who descended by the Taheke-roa [the long-rapid], by which way the current of death takes men to Hades. Hence, never consent to those doctrines&#8212;it means affliction both to the body and to the mind. Rather adhere to the life-giving ritual of man, and of food. Enough of my teaching on this subject; adhere to Rongo-marae-roa [the god of peace] to bring to you the branch [of the ceremonies and arts connected with the] knowledge of the ocean; the branch that was given to Lady-ocean and to Para-whenua-mea<A NAME="fr_51"></A><A HREF="#note_51"><FONT SIZE=1>51</FONT></A>; they will respond to appeals. All things

<!------------------------page 99------------------------>

<A NAME="page_99"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 99</FONT></A>

[gods, etc.] will be responsive if properly appealed to by appropriate ritual and prayer.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proper time for carrying on the proceedings in connection with the two 'baskets' referred to above [i.e., the evil branches of knowledge] commences in the month Aho-turuturu [July] and ends with Iho-matua [August],<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#note_52"><FONT SIZE=1>52</FONT></A> it is never longer than that. The reason why this is so, is that the great 'war of the gods,' named Te Pae-rangi, between Whiro-te-tipua and Tu-mata-uenga and others, commenced in July and ended in August.<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#note_53"><FONT SIZE=1>53</FONT></A> It was then that Whiro [god of death and evil] was defeated, and expened by T&#257;ne and his brethren to the Muriwai-hou at Rarohenga [Hades], and to the following [summary of] names:&#8212;Hawaiki-nui [Great Hawaiki], Hawaiki-roa [Long Hawaiki], Hawaiki-taketake [The original Hawaiki], Puhi-aitu [Death], Puhi-rakerake [where Spirits separate], Te Piere-nuku [where Spirits ascend to Heaven], Te Toi-o-te-reinga [the Uppermost Hades], Angiangi-tu [out of Sight above], Angiangi-raro [out of Sight to Hades], Whakaoti-nuku [beyond Earthly influences], Hou-turu and Hou-motu [absolutely divided off from Earthly life].<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#note_54"><FONT SIZE=1>54</FONT></A></P>

<H3 ALIGN="center">THE PO, OR AGES, &AElig;ONS OF DARKNESS.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, hence are recited [or quoted] the <I>pos</I> [or nights, ages, &aelig;ons] of Tua-nuku [the Earth-mother] and of Rangi-nui [the great Heaven-father], in the periods called Whetuki, Whekoki, Maru-aitu. When these were assigned to the stem [the origin, the root, to the exact spot] of Mahu-tonga [the home of the winds], of Para-wera-nui [the fierce westerly gales] and to Tahu-makaka-nui [the heavy westerly gales], to the east and north-east. These were [otherwise called] Paepae-t&eacute;-irihia, -t&eacute; kakea, Oi-nuku, Oi-roa; and then ended the <I>pos</I> of that branch [of cosmogony]&#8212;they were as follows:&#8212;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it must be understood that these <I>po</I> [&aelig;ons] were assigned to Pou-tere-rangi [to the entrance to Hades] to sweep away the misfortunes of the long-standing world down to Rarohenga [Hades], and where Te Kuwatawata and his companions are stationed&#8212;as will be explained. [See Chapter III.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these <I>po</I> have been separated off to our woman-kind [i.e., the menstrous periods].

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here end the <I>pos</I> assigned to 'The Waxing Moon' [i.e., the Moon generally]; and hence were separated the Moon and its elder brother [the Sun], and 'The ridge-of-Lady-ocean'<A NAME="fr_59"></A><A HREF="#note_59"><FONT SIZE=1>59</FONT></A> was fixed as a termination [a sphere of influence ?] in this world; these are 'Te Moana-waipu' [the deep ocean] and Te Moana-tarahau [? rough ocean].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is also an explanation: Whakaahu, a star [Castor, in the constellation Gemini] was appointed [or set up] at Te Rono-i-wairua<A NAME="fr_60"></A><A HREF="#note_60"><FONT SIZE=1>60</FONT></A> in Hawaiki. I have already explained that there were four doors in the temple of Whare-kura,<A NAME="fr_61"></A><A HREF="#note_61"><FONT SIZE=1>61</FONT></A> one road [into which] the <I>ara-matua</I>, or main way was to the south, at one end, another to the <I>rawhiti</I> or east. It was there that Whakaahu [Castor] stood; whilst Puanga [Rigel of Orion] was fixed at the east of Rarohenga [Hades].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain just here about a discussion amongst the priests of the Whare-w&#257;nanga when we were at Uawa,<A NAME="fr_62"></A><A HREF="#note_62"><FONT SIZE=1>62</FONT></A> in the college named Rawheoro. Some held that Puanga [Rigel], Kopu [Venus] and Tawera [also Venus] were names for one and the same star. Some said that the three names were all intended for Puanga, and Kopu was a secondary name as the star appeared suspended above the horizon at daylight, and Tawera was a third name for it as it rose in the heavens. Enough: this contention remained unshaken [with them]. We held that Puanga was a distinct star; but Kopu and Tawera are the same [as is most commonly believed by all Maoris].</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[It may be remarked just here, that, however clear to the Sage may have been his teaching on the subject of the P&#333;, or nights, ages, &aelig;ons, the subject is very difficult to understand without a much more full and explicit exposition than is herein given. It seems to the translator that there has come about in the process of ages of teaching, a confusion between the one series of <I>P&#333;s</I> relating to the cosmological ages preceding the birth of the gods, and another series under the same

<!------------------------page 102------------------------>

<A NAME="page_102"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 102</FONT></A>

name, which are more intimately connected with Astronomical Myth and the nights of the Moon, &amp;c. Much of this has been lost. The ordinary meaning of <I>P&#333;</I> is night; or a period of time; or the &aelig;ons darkness (mental and physical) prior to the birth of the gods.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center">THE WHARE-MAIRE.</H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Whare-maire<A NAME="fr_63"></A><A HREF="#note_63"><FONT SIZE=1>63</FONT></A> is a house of witchcraft; men are therein taught the ritual for man-slaying, destruction of food, blasting of trees or the land, spells for [retarding] men's footsteps, and spells said over weapons in war, or the ritual for divorce, &amp;c. All these are taught therein besides other matters; and hence is it called a Whare-maire. A true Whare-maire has only one <I>whatu</I> (stone) in it, at the main pillar; it is the stone called <I>mata-waiapu</I> [obsidian], and it is this the pupils have to bite at first, and after that they are taken outside, and exercised in the "Tipi-o-Houmea" [name of a spell] against a tree; the tree drys up. After that the same spell is directed against a bird such as a Miromiro [wren] or Pekapeka [bat]. If this is successful, the spell is tried on his mother, or elder-brother, or first-born&#8212;and if not one of them, the spell is directed towards the priest of the Whare-maire himself. If this is successful, the pupil leaves the <I>marae</I> of the Whare-maire, and thus he has acquired the power of the gods.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of the victims of his magic being at sea, or on the water, the Sorcerer calls on the god Ruamano to enforce his spell. But if on land he applies to the gods Tu-nui-a-te-ika, Maru, or Uenuku-rangi&#8212;besides others. [These are all minor, or tribal gods; Maru, particular, is a god of sorcery, and war-god of the West Coast tribes. It seems probable that they were all deified men, famous in their time for acts of sorcery, or distinguished in war.]</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3 ALIGN="center">THE WHARE-PORUKURUKU.<A NAME="fr_64"></A><A HREF="#note_64"><FONT SIZE=1>64</FONT></A></H3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of house is used for the same sort of teaching as in the Whare-maire, but it pertains to a single family, whilst the Whare-maire is used by all the neighbouring tribes. It is not like the Whare-w&#257;nanga where only the sons of chiefs are taught, whilst the Whare-marie and Whare-porukuruku are open to plebeans, and the

<!------------------------page 103------------------------>

<A NAME="page_103"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. 103</FONT></A>

cult of the evil gods is taught therein. [The teaching of these inferior houses] was a former cause of strife and trouble among the Maori tribes; the proper course would have been to adhere to the teaching of the Whare-w&#257;nanga alone.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[It comes out with tolerable clearness in what is written above, the broad distinction between two classes of priests of former days. The one, and the higher class, did not concern themselves with sorcery, though they had the same (supposed) power over the forces of nature as the other&#8212;or <I>tohunga-makutu</I>, i.e., Sorcerers&#8212;and used enumerable incantations for most purposes considered necessary for the tribal welfare. This distinction is not always emphasised, or properly known of by writers on the other side of the world who, indeed, have to rely on the publications of local authors who, themselves, have either not been aware of the fact, or have not given sufficient prominence to it.]</P>

It was suggested in the Introduction to these Chapters, that the Angami tribes of Assam, India, were a belated branch of the Polynesian people. This ceremony of placing a <I>whatu</I> at the base of the main post of a house was known to them as well as the Maoris, as the following extract from Vol. XX., No.2. 1909&#8212;of "Folk Lore" will show&#8212;Mrs. T.C. Hodson therein says: "The head man of a large and powerful village on the frontier state of Manipur was engaged in building himself a new house, and to strengthen it seized this man&#8212;a Naga&#8212;and forcibly cut off a lock of his hair, which had to be buried underneath the main post of the house. In olden times the head would have been put there, but by a refinement of some native theologian a lock of hair was held to be as good as a whole head." The Angami people are a branch of the Nagas and live just north of Manipur.</P>

The ordinary fire-place of a Maori home is situated near the middle of the floor, and is a shallow hole with a flat stone on each of its four sides. In the ancient temple named Hawaiki (from which all subsequent places of that name derive their origin) there were four <I>takuahi</I>, one opposite each door, but in the centre of the temple, the doors being opposite the four cardinal directions; it was by these the spirits entered from the four points of the compass, and it was in this temple spirits of the dead separated&#8212;some to the Supreme God Io, others to the evil spirit, and fallen god Whiro. See later on. The Scribe says these stones were about nine inches high, and the pupils who have passed a good examination are placed on the right-hand stones, those who have to come up again on the left. Each stone has a different name, as mentioned below.</P>

It was the most enduring form of peace of all. In the Ure-wera country it is known as the 'Tatau-pou-namu' or 'Jadeite-door,' presumably meaning that the peace was as enduring as a door made of that material&#8212;not, however, that this valuable substance was ever used for such a purpose&#8212;the expression was allegorical. Rongo-taketake as used here implies that the knowledge gained by the pupils will last; he will never forget.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_20"></A><A HREF="#fr_20">20</A>. This ceremony is often referred to in Maori history. The act of simulated biting is said to induce the 'hardening,' or remembrance of the teaching. It is also said to shew the determination of the pupil to adhere to the teaching, a form of declaration that they were equal to anything, however repulsive, in order to show their proficiency.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_21"></A><A HREF="#fr_21">21</A>. The clothing consisted of a short flax kilt, called a <I>pekerangi</I>&#8212;so called from the fact that when not in use and hung out to air, they were placed on the <I>pekerangi</I>, or outside palisade of the <I>pa</I>.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_22"></A><A HREF="#fr_22">22</A>. As a matter of fact, all but the <I>koukou</I>, or what may be calied a scalp-lock, was close clipped or shaven in both men and boys, whether being taught or not. It was considered highly advantageous if the wizard could procure any part of the victim he intended to bewitch, over which to say his incantations, and hence the care exercised, as described above.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_23"></A><A HREF="#fr_23">23</A>. The window, in all houses, was on the right of the door as one entered, and within the door on the left hand side was the place of honour for guests in an ordinary house. Both door and window were closed by sliding panels.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_24"></A><A HREF="#fr_24">24</A>. Kaunoti, is the dry stick laid on the ground and on to which the pointed <I>kaurimarima</I> is briskly rubbed to procure fire&#8212;the common Polynesian method. In travelling these dried sticks (of certain woods only, in which M&#257;ui had placed the 'seeds of fire'), were carried suspended round the neck to keep them dry, and thus by contact with the body they became <I>tapu</I>&#8212;so says the Scribe, but I think the <I>ahi tapu</I> means rather a sacred fire, especially generated in connection with various ceremonies.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_25"></A><A HREF="#fr_25">25</A>. Of course we unbelieving White people cannot exactly swallow this. There is probably some esoteric meaning here not explained.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_26"></A><A HREF="#fr_26">26</A>. Ruatau, Aitu-Pawa, and Rehua were of the minor gods, guardians of the treasures of the uppermost heavens where Io dwelt, As we shall see in Chapter III., they are heavenly priests, to whom Io delegated the power of consecration, to purify T&#257;ne on this ascent to the highest heaven.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_27"></A><A HREF="#fr_27">27</A>. Tawhiri-rangi, see <A HREF="#page_81">number three</A> in the list of Whare-w&#257;nanga <I>ante</I>. Te Rangi-kaupapa is the name of its door. The reciter asks that the door of the college may be as closely shut as that of the heavenly house, so that nothing may be heard of the teaching outside.</P>

The reciter appears to address these learned gods to inspire the pupil with understanding, and so to close np the place of teaching that no extraneous matters should divert the attention of the pupils, etc.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_30"></A><A HREF="#fr_30">30</A>. Rongo-marae-roa, god of peace.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_38"></A><A HREF="#fr_38">38</A>. These three are gods of the underworld, about which we shall learn later on.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_39"></A><A HREF="#fr_39">39</A>. Names for the underworld or Hades.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_40"></A><A HREF="#fr_40">40</A>. The name <I>hua-kuru</I> is interesting; it means 'fruit of the bread-fruit-tree,' and is possibly so called because the stones used in some former habitat bore the appearance of the green bread-fruit, which, of course does not grow in New Zealand, though common all over the warmer parts of Polynesia.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_41"></A><A HREF="#fr_41">41</A>. The Scribe tells me that during this ceremony of stone-swallowing, one of the larger stones deposited at the rearest pillar was elevated on a kind of stool, called a <I>pou-turu</I>, and in the centre of this stone was a circular hole, over which the pupil places his left hand, the right hand resting on the shoulder of the priest, who, then taking one of the small pebbles in his mouth, recites a <I>karakia</I>; after which he places the stone in the month of the pupil, who swallows it. This pebble is afterwards recovered, and always retained by the pupil. In cases where he has to recite any of the matter taught in the College, he places this stone in his mouth whilst speaking. It is then called a <I>kohatu-mataki</I>, or <I>puaroa</I>; and the belief is that by its means the full recollection of all he has learned in the College comes back to him. One of these stones I saw, was a little piece of chalcedony, about the size of a walnut, and had probably been a Moa gizzard stone.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_42"></A><A HREF="#fr_42">42</A>. Tupai was one of those who accompanied the god T&#257;ne to the uppermost Heaven when he went to obtain the three 'baskets' of knowledge. It was also the name of one of the priests that came in the 'Takitimu' canoe to New Zealand <I>circa</I> 1350.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_43"></A><A HREF="#fr_43">43</A>. Many of these <I>karakias</I> had to be recited without a break to take breath; a solution of its continuity destroyed its efficacy. When the first priest's breath was exhausted, another one would <I>kapo</I>, or take up the strain, and carry it on without break to the end. Such is what the Sage refers to. It is well-known that the old Hindu priests acted in a similar manner to these Polynesians, in ancient days, and, that according to them, to be effective the prayers (<I>mantras</I>) must be completed in one breath.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_45"></A><A HREF="#fr_45">45</A>. Uruao, the 'Cloud Piercer': but the name is also that of the first canoe built by these people in the Fatherland, of which Tama-rereti was commander, and as we shall see, in it he explored some countries to the east&#8212;probably Indonesia. This canoe, Te Waka-a-Tama-rereti, is now represented in the Heavens by the constellation Scorpio. Uruao above means a single clap of thunder. The Scribe says that the first canoe built by these people was copied from the constellation. This Celestial vessel is supposed to be laden with many of the smaller stars, which sometimes fall out, and are then known as meteors.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_46"></A><A HREF="#fr_46">46</A>. Though the months here start with January, the Maori year really begins with the rising of the constellation Matariki [the Pleiades] at sunset at the first new moon in June. Other priests say the year commenced with the rising of the star Puanga (Rigel); about this much might be said, but this is not the place.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_47"></A><A HREF="#fr_47">47</A>. This starement will no doubt cause surprise and disgust. But it was one of the ordeals that a pupil under instruction in the art of witchcraft had to pass through, as showing his readiness to undertake any of the other and severe ordeals, before he became proficient in the art. There is a Maori expression, <I>he tangata kai tutae</I> (a man who would eat excrement), implying that such a one would face any difficulty in order to accomplish his end&#8212;a man who would fight to the death to secure victory for his side.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_48"></A><A HREF="#fr_48">48</A>. Kaiuku, a name given to a <I>pa</I> at Te Mahia on account of a notable siege in which the inhabitants were reduced to eating clay&#8212;which is the meaning of the word. See "Maori Wars of the Nineteenth Century," p. 328 (2nd Edition, 1910).</P>

<P><A NAME="note_49"></A><A HREF="#fr_49">49</A>. These spells were supposed to be all powerful in witchcraft. An example of their (supposed) effect is well illustrated in the story of "Mahu and Taewa," 'Journal Polynesian Society.' Vol. VII., p. 127. A very much more complete account of these incidents, in which the several ordeals are described, will be published later. Different forms of affliction are also known by the above emblematical names.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_50"></A><A HREF="#fr_50">50</A>. These will be explained in Chapter III.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_51"></A><A HREF="#fr_51">51</A>. Para-whenua-mea, emblematical for one of the gods of the 'Deluge.' The word is also used to represent the effacement of nature due to the flood. Para-whenua-mea is connected also with the Hawaiian godess of voloanoes, Pele.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_52"></A><A HREF="#fr_52">52</A>. This statement must not be confounded with a previous one, where it is said that the Session lasts from April to October; the Sage is here referring to the months in which witchcraft is taught.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_53"></A><A HREF="#fr_53">53</A>. This great division of the gods, known as 'The War of Pae-rangi,' will be fully described in Chapter III.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_54"></A><A HREF="#fr_54">54</A>. Such are the meanings given by the Scribe. They are no doubt emblematical names used by the priests to recan certain events or circumstances to their minds. We shall come across others of a similar nature later on.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_55"></A><A HREF="#fr_55">55</A>. It is difficult to explain in English (or even to understand) the ideas conveyed by the expressions in the above paragraphs; but approximately the words express the various ages or &aelig;ons of cosmical darkness, during which the Sky-father adhered closely to the Mother-earth, and during which, and due to which, the gods were conceived and born. Many other recitations give ten as the number of &aelig;ons prior to the coming forth of the gods to the light of the world. These &aelig;ons seem to be personified, endowed with semi-personal and material charaoteristics, as the next paragraph shows. The Scribe says they are the names of the <I>po</I> (nights, ages, &amp;c.) of the Reinga, or Hades, where no light is ever seen&#8212;it is always thus. But compare the story of Mataora given in Chapter VI., which seems to contradict this.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_56"></A><A HREF="#fr_56">56</A>. The rising or waxing moon, an expression the Sage often employs for the moon.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_57"></A><A HREF="#fr_57">57</A>. The Scribe states that this division of the lunar month, is the ancient division into four-day periods.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_58"></A><A HREF="#fr_58">58</A>. These are other names for division of the month acoording to brightness of the moon.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_59"></A><A HREF="#fr_59">59</A>. Ridge = <I>tuahiwi</I>; The ocean between New Zealand and Hawaiki is supposed to have a 'ridge' in it, where boisterous weather, according io tradition, was frequently met with&#8212;it is probably the meeting point of the Trade-winds and the generally prevailing westerly winds, between latitude 25&deg; and 30&deg;. Cook's Straits is equally supposed to have a <I>tuahiwi</I> in it. But it is clear that the <I>tuahiwi</I> mentioned in the text is far more ancient than the two here referred to, and refers to that <I>tuahiwi</I> in the heavens, otherwise the Milky Way, which was appointed as a division between the spheres of the sun and moon, after their strife.&#8212;See Chapter V.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_60"></A><A HREF="#fr_60">60</A>. Te Hono-i-wairua, the assemblage of spirits; where the spirits of the dead gathered at the first Hawaiki prior to their separation, some to the supreme god Io, others to the realms of Whiro in the under-world.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_63"></A><A HREF="#fr_63">63</A>. The Scribe says the name <I>maire</I> is derived from the tree of that name, of which weapons were made; and as the Whare-maire was used for the teaching of witchcraft principally (according to these tribes, but not to others), leading to death, the house was so called in consequence.</P>

<P><A NAME="note_64"></A><A HREF="#fr_64">64</A>. This is taken from another part of Te Matorohanga's teaching. The Whare-porukuruku was a temporary house of learning, used when the people were away from their permanent homes, says the Scribe.</P>
