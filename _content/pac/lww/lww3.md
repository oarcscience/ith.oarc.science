\[T<span class="small">HE</span> previous two Chapters are from the
teaching of Te Matorohanga. We shall in this Chapter follow that of
Nepia Te Ika Pohuhu, of the Ngati-Hine-pare tribe, one of those who Te
Matorohanga frequently mentions as equally learned with himself. What
follows was taught to H. T. Whatahoro in April, and the following
months, 1863, who wrote it down from the old priest's dictation. The
whole of Pohuhu's teaching has been passed by the Tane-nui-a-rangi
Committee, and each page of the original is sealed with their seal, thus
showing that it meets with the assent of all the most learned men of the
present time belonging to the East Coast tribes.

   The same matter as contained in this Chapter has also been dictated
by Te Matorohanga to the same Scribe, a copy of which is deposited in
the Dominion Museum; but we have made use of Pohuhu's teaching, because
it is not so long as the other; at the same time it contains every
essential part of the teaching relating to the gods, and where necessary
this Chapter will be illustrated from the matter in the Dominion Museum
copy, of which the original from which it was taken, now lies before the
Translator. If funds be forthcoming hereafter, Te Matorohanga's teaching
may also be printed.

   Pohuhu's teaching on the subject of Io, the Supreme God, is identical
with that of Te Matorohanga given in last Chapter, and is therefore not
repeated here.\]

 

### OF THE NAMES OF THE HEAVENS.

THE Heavens that stand above us are twelve in number, and the following
are their names:—

   The above are the names of the Heavens in their order as they stand
above us \[the first being the summit; number twelve, the sky above and
nearest to the earth\]. Those twelve Heavens are where the Apa-atua
\[the messenger-gods, or, perhaps, the company of gods\] of each Heaven
move to and fro. There is only one Heaven that cannot be attained by
these Apa—the Toi-o-nga-rangi, or, otherwise, Tikitiki-o-rangi; this is
the most sacred of all the Heavens, and Io alone, with the
Apa-Whatu-kura \[the company of male guardians, or gods\] and
Apa-Marei-kura \[the company of female guardians, or godesses\] of that
Heaven dwell there. The Marei-kuras and the Whatu-kuras have the entrée
to all the eleven Heavens, and even down to the earth. It is only when
Io sends his messengers to one of the Apas of the twelve Heavens that
they are allowed into Tikitiki-o-nga-rangi. They never enter it without
permission.

   Tawhiri-rangi is the name of the house through which entry is
obtained into \[the uppermost Heaven\]. Underneath it is the mouth, or
the door, called Te Pu-motomoto-o-Tikitiki-o-rangi; that is, it is the
door of entry into Tawhiri-rangi, within which house are the guardians
of Te Pu-motomoto—very numerous are they, viz., the Puhi-tau \[general
name for the different winds that guard the entrance\], Maioro-rangi,
\[Rampart-of-Heaven\], Houere-tu \[winds blowing upwards\], Houere-tau
\[fighting winds\], and other numerous Apas.<span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#note_1) None of the Whatu-kura of the other \[and
lower\] Heavens, not a single one, may enter; unless Rua-tau, Aitu-pawa,
Rehua, Puhao-rangi or Tau-o-rongo,<span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#note_2)
who alone have the authority, open the circular-window, or the
Pu-moto-moto, and allow some one Apa to enter, whether from the eleven
Heavens, the earth, or any other place. But there is much about this
subject. I am not able to recite it all.

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

 

### MARRIAGE OF HEAVEN AND EARTH.

   The Rangi-nui \[great sky\], which stands above, felt a desire
towards Papa-tua-nuku \[the earth\], whose belly was turned up \[towards
him\]; he desired her as a wife. So Rangi came down to Papa. In that
period the amount of light was nil; absolute and complete darkness
\[*po-kutikuti kakarauri*\] prevailed; there was no sun, no moon, no
stars, no clouds, no light, no mist—no ripples stirred the surface of
ocean; no breath of air, a complete and absolute stillness.

   And so Rangi-nui dwelt with Papa-tua-nuku as his wife; and then he
set \[*hikaia* = *whakato*, to set, plant\] plants to cover the
nakedness of Papa; for her armpits, her head, and the body; and after
that the smaller trees to clothe them both, for the body of the earth
was naked. Subsequently he placed the upstanding trees of the forest,
and now Papa felt a great warmth, which was all-embracing. After this
were placed the insects of all kinds, the *aitanga-pekepeketua* \[the
ancestors of the *tuatara*, great lizard\], appropriate to the recesses
of the smaller vegetation, the clumps of smaller trees, and the
*wao-tu-rangi*, the great forests \[whose heads reach the skies\]. Then
the crabs, the *toitoi* \[the larger species of univalves\], the *pipi*
\[the bivalves\] the *ngakihi*,<span id="fr_3"></span>[3](#note_3) the
mussel, the haliotis, and similar things, which have shells, were
assigned their places to animate the earth and the waters thereof. A
great deal might be said on this subject; but let this suffice. Te
Matorohanga can fully explain—I might go wrong.

 

### CREATION OF THE GODS.

   After the last of all these things had been planted by Rangi-nui and
Papa, they then created their \[proper\] offspring \[i.e., the gods\];
the eyes were made first,<span id="fr_4"></span>[4](#note_4) and then
the 'house' to hold them, i.e., the head. After the head, the bust and
body and the bones of the legs, according to their growth
\[shapes\].<span id="fr_5"></span>[5](#note_5)

   Because Rangi-nui overlaid and completely covered Papa-tua-nuku, the
growth of all things could not mature, nor could anything bear fruit
\[or increase\]; they were in an unstable condition, floating about the
Ao-pouri \[the world of darkness\], and this was their appearance: some
were crawling \[after the manner of lizards\], some were upright with
the arms held up, some were lying with the knees partly drawn <span
id="page_118">p. 118</span> up, some lying on their sides, some were
lying stretched out at full length, some on their backs, some were
stooping, some with their heads bent down, some with their legs drawn
up, some embracing, some kicking out with legs and arms, some kneeling,
some standing, some inhaling deep breaths, some with exhausted breath,
some crawling, some walking, some feeling about in the dark, some
arising, some gazing, some sitting still, and in many other
attitudes—they were all within the embrace of Rangi-nui and Papa.<span
id="fr_6"></span>[6](#note_6)

   Now, this is the list of names of \[the minor gods\] the family of
Rangi and Papa:—

|                                |                                                                               |                                   |                                                  |

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

   The above are the gods, offspring of the Sky-father and Earth-mother.
They are all males.<span id="fr_8"></span>[8](#note_8)

 

### THE AGES OF DARKNESS; OF CHAOS.<span id="fr_9"></span>[9](#note_9)

   The nature of the existence of the gods was such as has been
explained \[i.e., within the embrace of their parents, and in the
attitudes described above\]. The names of the Pō or ages, or æons,
during which they dwelt there, are as follows:—

|                     |                                                            |                    |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| 1\. Te Po-kauru     | 3\. Te Po-kakarauri                                        | 5\. Te Po-kerekere |
| 2\. Te Po-uriuri    | 4\. Te Po-aoao-nui                                         | 6\. Te Po-tamaku   |
|                     | 7\. Te Po-tiwhatiwha<span id="fr_10"></span>[10](#note_10) |                    |

   It was after this manner that they dwelt in Pō, within the space
included in the embrace of their parents. It was very long that
condition of affairs existed; until at last a faint glimmering of light,
a scintillation like the light of a star was seen, or like the
Will-o-the-wisp at night. And now commenced a desire on the part of the
family of gods to go forth from between their parents to follow the
faint appearance of light. Some of them \[the gods\] consented, some did
not; and thus it became a matter of strife between them. Tāne (68),
Tu-pai (69)<span id="fr_11"></span>[11](#note_11) and others said, "Let
us seek a means by which we may go forth." The matter was then assented
to. Now Uru-te-ngangana (1) the eldest of the family had been persuaded
by Whiro-te-tipua's (6) arguments against going forth, and hence they
remained until the last.

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

 

### THE GODS GO FORTH TO THE WORLD OF LIGHT.

   Now, at a certain time after \[that discussion\] Ue-poto (28) went to
bathe and wash away the clammy feeling arising through the warmth of
their dwelling place \[within the embrace of their parents\]. He was
carried away outside on the current of their mother's urine, and found
himself outside in a gentle cooling breeze, which was sweet scented in
the nostrils of Ue-poto. He thought, this is the best place, here
outside, so he called out under the sides of his parents: "O sirs! Come
outside, for this is a pleasant place for us."

   When the menstruous time of their mother Earth came, then Tāne (68)
came forth. This was in the seventh Pō, or age of their desire to search
for the "way of the female"<span id="fr_12"></span>[12](#note_12) in
order to go forth. On reaching the outside world, they then saw that it
was indeed a pleasant place for them \[to dwell\]. There was, however, a
drawback; for the different kinds of the cold of Heaven \[or space\],
Wero-i-te-ninihi, Wero-i-te-wawana, Kŭna-wiri, Maeke, and Kotokoto,
there spread out their intense cold.<span
id="fr_13"></span>[13](#note_13) Hence, did Rangi and Papa closely
embrace \[to exclude the cold from ther offspring\], and, hence, also
originated the 'goose-flesh,' and trembling through cold \[from which
mankind suffers to this day\]. These are the enemies that afflicted the
family<span id="fr_14"></span>[14](#note_14) of their father. In
consequence of this, they sheltered under the sides of their mother,
where they found warmth, which they named *Whakaruru-taha*
\[shelter-by-the-side\], which name came down to us, and is applied to a
warm and pleasant place where no winds blow.

   After this, when the ninth and tenth ages had come, Uru-te-nga-ngana
(1) and others came forth—they formed the second party; and then
Whiro-te-tipua (6) and his friends were urged to come forth. He did so
with anger, and afflicted some of the other gods with baldness on top of
the head and the same on the forehead, the eyelashes and eyebrows
\[which have descended to mankind through Whiro's action\]. Great indeed
was the wrath of Whiro (6) at Tāne (68) because of his inducing them to
come forth from \[the shelter of\] their parents,to be 'bitten' by
Wero-i-te-ninihi, Wero-i-te-wawana, and, Wero-i-te-kokota \[the cold of
space\]—that was the cause of his anger.

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

 

### THE SEPARATION OF HEAVEN AND EARTH.

   Some time after the foregoing events Tāne (68) said, "Let us now
separate our parents that Rangi and Papa may occupy different places."
Whiro (6) would not consent to this proposition, and there was much
strife in consequence. But Tāne-nui-a-rangi (68) became more urgent; and
then Tangaroa (8), Tu-mata-uenga (11), and Tawhiri-matea (7) finally
agreed. And now Rangi-nui \[the Sky-father\], was propped up into the
position he now holds. In the propping up by Tāne (68) with the four
props, one was placed at the head, one on each side, and one at the
legs, making the four that separated Rangi from Papa. \[Compare this
belief in the four props with the similar one of the Egyptians.\] But as
the props were lifted and Rangi was still suspended in space, one at the
legs and one at the head slipped.<span id="fr_15"></span>[15](#note_15)
Tāne called out to Paia,<span id="fr_16"></span>[16](#note_16) "O Pai!"
Paia replied, "Here am I!" Tāne said, "Raise him up above." In this
uplifting and raising in order that Rangi-nui might float above, he did
not quite rise to the position required, because the arms of both Rangi
and Papa grasped one another and held fast. Then Tāne called out to
Tu-mata-kaka (63) and Tu-mata-uenga (11), telling them to fetch an axe
to cut the arms of their parents. Tu-mata-kaka asked, "O Tāne! Where is
the source of axes to be found?" Tāne said, "Fetch one from the pillow
of our elder brother, Uru-te-ngangana (1), to cut them with. Fetch a
handle from Tua-matua (59), who will put a keen edge on the axe and
fasten it to its handle." The two axes, named 'Te Awhio-rangi' and 'Te
Whiro-nui,' were then fetched<span id="fr_17"></span>[17](#note_17); and
then the arms of Rangi-nui and Papa-tua-huku were severed and they were
completely separated. At that time Paia cut off from the neck of
Rangi-nui the *Ahi-tapu*, or sacred fire, which he subsequently used to
make fire with, using his *karakia* <span id="page_122">p. 122</span>
\[incantation\] in doing so. But I do not know that formula, though Te
Matarohanga does.<span id="fr_18"></span>[18](#note_18)

   Now, when Rangi-nui had been properly placed in position as is now to
be seen, the blood from the arms dripped down on to Papa \[the Earth\],
and hence is the *horu* \[red oxide of iron\], and the *pukepoto* \[blue
phosphate of iron\], that his descendants in this world use in
painting.<span id="fr_19"></span>[19](#note_19) And hence also is the
red appearance that inflames the skies at sunrise or sunset—that is the
blood of Rangi's arms.

 

### THE APAS, OR MESSENGERS OF THE GODS.

   I will now describe the nature of the Apas of each division of the
twelve heavens, thus:—

   The first Apas<span id="fr_20"></span>[20](#note_20) are those that
dwell in Te Toi-o-nga-rangi \[the highest Heaven\] as follows: The
Apa-Whatukura are males; the Apa-Marei-kura are females. When these Apas
travel it is appropriate to refer to them as the 'Company of
Whatu-kuras,' and 'Company of Marei-kuras.' It is these Apas alone who
visit Io-nui in Toi-o-nga-rangi \[the summit of the heavens\]. On Io's
command only \[can the others\] enter there, that is, whenever Io wishes
them to do so can they enter the Toi-o-nga-rangi; they will not presume
to do so otherwise, because that Heaven is sacred to Io and his
particular company \[of Apas\] as explained before.

   But the Company of Whatu-kuras, and the Apa-Marei-kuras \[of the
uppermost heaven\] are able to \[freely\] enter any of the other eleven
heavens, that is, to enter where they like, whether in the Heavens or
the Earth—they have power to do that. It is just the same with the <span
id="page_123">p. 123</span> Apas of the eleven heavens outside Te
Toi-o-nga-rangi \[they may freely come\] even down to Earth and Hades.

   Here follow the names of the Heavens outside Te Toi-o-nga-rangi, and
the male and female Apas \[guardian angels or spirits\] of each:—

|                                                  |                                                  |                                                |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*Name of Heaven.*   </span>  | <span class="small">*Male Guardians.*   </span>  | <span class="small">*Female Guardians.*</span> |
| <span class="small">Tintiri-o-matangi   </span>  | <span class="small">Apa Pahurangi   </span>      | <span class="small">Apa Kahurangi</span>       |
| <span class="small">Rangi-naonao-ariki   </span> | <span class="small">Apa Matangi-nui   </span>    | <span class="small">Apa Mata-ru-wai</span>     |
| <span class="small">Rangi-te-wawana   </span>    | <span class="small">Apa Kahui-kura   </span>     | <span class="small">Apa Ruao</span>            |
| <span class="small">Rangi-nui-ka-tika   </span>  | <span class="small">Apa Rehu-roa   </span>       | <span class="small">Apa Rehu-punga</span>      |
| <span class="small">Rangi-mata-ura   </span>     | <span class="small">Apa Poporo-kewa   </span>    | <span class="small">Apa Kauwhanga</span>       |
| <span class="small">Tauru-rangi   </span>        | <span class="small">Apa Patu-pai-arehe   </span> | <span class="small">Apa Turehu</span>          |
| <span class="small">Rangi-mata-wai   </span>     | <span class="small">Apa Taranga-tahi   </span>   | <span class="small">Apa Kopu-wai</span>        |
| <span class="small">Rangi-maire-kura   </span>   | <span class="small">Apa Kauru-rangi   </span>    | <span class="small">Apa Kehu-rangi</span>      |
| <span class="small">Rangi-parauri   </span>      | <span class="small">Apa Kapeka-a-rangi   </span> | <span class="small">Apa Rau-angiangi</span>    |
| <span class="small">Rangi-tamaku   </span>       | <span class="small">Apa Hopara-a-rangi   </span> | <span class="small">Apa Maruhiruhi</span>      |
| <span class="small">Rangi-nui-a-tamaku   </span> | <span class="small">*(Not given.)*   </span>     | <span class="small">Apa Tohi-kura</span>       |

   O Sir! the Apa Tāne \[male Apas\] are, perhaps, not correctly recited
by me, ask Te Matorohanga, he is acquainted with the correct position to
which they were appointed by Io-matua \[Io-the-father\].

   Now, at this time the family of gods proceeded to arrauge the
*kaupeka*<span id="fr_21"></span>[21](#note_21) of Rangi-nui, that is,
to direct matters so that they might be able to adopt a course leading
to their benefit. But they were not able to accomplish it, for they were
confused about the direction of earthly things—they could not manage it.

 

### THE SEPARATION OF THE DWELLINGS OF THE GODS.

   They now decided to have separate dwelling-places. Whiro-te-tipua
(6), Uru-te-ngangana (1), and their immediate friends dwelt in
Tu-te-aniwaniwa \['where-stands-the-rainbow'\]—that was their house, and
the place where they lived.

   Tu-mata-uenga (11), Tama-kaka (? 63),<span
id="fr_22"></span>[22](#note_22) Rongo-marae-roa (14), and others, dwelt
in Whare-kura \[the first earthly Whare-wānanga, or House of learning,
which is its meaning. See introduction to Chapter I.\]—that was their
house, and the place where they dwelt with their friends.

   Tāne (68), Paia and others dwelt in Huaki-pouri with their friends.

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

   Thus it was that the family dwelt separately; an envious heart was
the reason, and the following were the causes of this ill feeling:—

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    1. | On account of the persistence of Tāne (68) that they should go forth from the embrace of their parents.                                                                                                                                             |
|    2. | The 'biting' of the *anu-rangi*<span id="fr_23"></span>[23](#note_23) \[cold of space\], *anu-wai* \[cold of the waters\], *anu-winiwini* \[extreme cold\] and *anu-matao* \[excessive cold\].                                                      |
|    3. | The persistance of Tāne (68), Tupai (69) and their faction, that their parents Rangi and Papa should be separated.                                                                                                                                  |
|    4. | The 'evil heart' of Tāne, Tupai, Tu-mata-uenga (11), Tu-mata-kaka (63), and others, in deciding to cut off the arms of their parents with the axes 'Awhio-rangi' and 'Whiro-nui.'                                                                   |
|    5. | The presumption of Tāne and his faction in undertaking these works. If it had been Uru-te-ngangana (1), Ro-i ho (2), Hae-puru (4), Tangaroa (8), and Tu-mata-uenga (11) \[the seniors of the family\], Whiro (6) would have consented.              |
|    6. | The conceit of Tāne in declaring that he could ascend the 'sacred-winds' of the conjoint Heavens that stand above. Rather should Whiro himself have accomplished the journey to the Toi-o-nga-rangi \[the highest Heaven.—See *infra* about this\]. |

   The above were the causes why Whiro and his faction were so jealous
of Tāne.

 

### THE SANCTIFICATION OF TANE.

   Now, at this period, Io-matua \[the supreme god, the father\] said
unto Rua-matua and Rehua \[two of the guardians of the heavenly
treasures\], "Go ye down to the Earth, and on Maunga-nui \[great
mountain\] command Tāne (68) and Tupai (69) to ascend to ye up the
mountain. You will there purify them and baptise them in the 'waters of
Rongo' on that mountain, and then return." These were the sons of the
family.<span id="fr_24"></span>[24](#note_24)

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

   So these two Whatu-kuras, Rua-tau and Rehua, descended to the summit
of Maunga-nui, and commanded Tāne and Tupal to climb up to them. The two
\[gods\] did so, and on reaching Rua-tau and Rehua, they were taken to
the 'waters of Rongo' and baptised. Thus were they purified; and now for
the first time did Tāne (68) receive his full name of Tāne-nui-a-rangi
\[Great Tāne-of-the-Heavens\], whilst Tupai received that of Tupai-a-tau
\[? so called after Rua-tau\]. After this Rua-tau and Rehua re-ascended
to Te Toi-o-nga-rangi \[the uppermost Heaven\] to Io-mata-ngaro
\[Io-the-hidden-face\], whilst Tāne-nui-a-rangi and Tupai-a-tau returned
to their dwelling place at Huaki-pouri.

|       |                                                                                                                                                         |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    7. | This was the seventh cause of Whiro-te-tipua's illfeeling; the sanctification, and the baptism of those new names for Tāne-nui-a-rangi and Tupai-a-tau. |

   After these events Io-taketake \[Io-the-origin of all things\] said
to Rua-tau and Aitu-pawa \[Treasure-guardians of heaven\]: "Go! Ask of
the family of Rangi-nui \[the Sky-father\] which single one of them will
be able to ascend the Toi-hua-rewa<span id="fr_25"></span>[25](#note_25)
of the Heavens to Tikitiki-o-rangi \[the uppermost heaven\] to meet me
at Matangi-reia" \[the sun's path in the Heavens, the home of Io\]. Then
these two, Rua-tau and Aitu-pawa, descended to Tu-te-aniwaniwa \[one of
the separate houses in which the gods dwelt after coming forth from the
parental embrace\], and laid their mission before Uru-te-ngangana (1)
and Whiro (6) and their faction.

   Whiro informed them that he could climb up by the winds of Heaven,
and bring back the *wānanga* \[all knowledge, etc.\]. Rua-tau asked, "By
what way wilt thou climb, O Whiro?" The latter answered, "By the
'Taepatanga'<span id="fr_26"></span>[26](#note_26) of the Heavens Will I
ascend." "*Tai hiti, tai wawa*!" replied Aitu-pawa, "You will not
succeed, for the winds of the conjoint Heavens are *akaaka*" \[difficult
to overcome—an uncommon word\].

   The two gods then went to Whare-kura \[another of the houses of the
gods\], and Rua-tau asked, "Which of you is able to ascend the conjoint
Heavens to the Toi-o-nga-rangi, to Io-the-origin-of-all-things?"
Rongo-marae-roa (14) and his faction replied, that Tāne-nui-a-rangi (68)
could accomplish it. The two messengers then went to Huaki-pouri
\[Tāne's house\] and asked them, "Which of you will be able to <span
id="page_126">p. 126</span> climb by the winds of the conjoint Heavens
to Te Toi-o-nga-rangi, to Io-the-origin-of-all-things, at Matangi-reia
in its beauty and expanse?"<span id="fr_27"></span>[27](#note_27) Tāne
replied to this, "I can do it!" Then said Ruatau, "By which way will you
ascend?" Tāne replied, "I will ascend by the Ara-tiatia, the
Toi-hua-rewa<span id="fr_28"></span>[28](#note_28) of the family of my
elder brother, Tawhiri-matea (7) \[god of winds\], who dwells above in
Tihi-o-manono."<span id="fr_29"></span>[29](#note_29) Ruatau and ‘Pawa
then said, "Enough! Ascend to the Pumotomoto \[entrance to\]
Tikitiki-o-rangi \[highest Heaven\], to Tawhiri-rangi \[guard house of\]
Te Toi-o-nga-rangi-tuhaha \[summit of all the Heavens\]." After that
Ruatau and Aitu-pawa returned.

   \[Hearing of this\] Whiro (6) said unto to his elder brethren, "I
intend to go and fetch the *wānanga* \[knowledge\] at Te
Toi-o-nga-rangi." Uru-te-ngangana (1) and others said, "Leave our
younger brother to fetch it—he who has ascended Maunga-nui and
Maunga-roa, and been consecrated to the Au-kume, Au-rona, and
Au-ihiihi."<span id="fr_30"></span>[30](#note_30) Whiro was very wroth
at this and said, "Who, indeed, has said, that he, a younger son, will
ascend above through all the Heavens?"

 

### THE FIRST TEMPLE IS BUILT ON EARTH. AND OTHER HOUSES.

   Tāne-nui-a-rangi (68) now urged his brethren, saying, "Tamakaka (63),
Tupai-a-tau (69), Rongo-marae-roa (14) and Tawhiri-matea (7); let us all
go to Rangi-tamaku \[the eleventh Heaven from the summit\] and obtain
the design of Whare-kura and build a similar one here \[on earth\]; in
which to deposit the *tahū*<span id="fr_31"></span>[31](#note_31) of the
*wānanga* of the Heavens." Tawhire-matea (7) consented to this. When
they reached Rangi-tamaku, they carefully copied the design of the
temple; it was a temple for dwelling in; they measured the pillars, the
length of the ridge and <span id="page_127">p. 127</span> the house, the
width and the height. That house belonged to Nuku-te-aio, father of
Rua-i-te-pukenga,<span id="fr_32"></span>[32](#note_32) who disclosed to
Tāne the location of that house. That house was a *matarua*, that is,
having two windows, one on each side of the door.

   On their return they built Whare-kura as a depository for the
knowledge which Ruatau and ‘Pawa had told one of the family to fetch. So
they built and finished it—\[the first Whare-kura or Temple of learning
on Earth, from the design of which in succeeding ages all other Temples
were built\].

   After this was built Te Whare-rangi, the house of Tamakaka (63), and
some others; it had only one window on the right-hand side of the door.
This kind of house \[in modern times\] is called a *matahi*. Then they
built the house of Tupai (69) named Rangi-pukohu. When that was
completed they erected a house for Tāne (68) and Tangaroa (8), named
Hui-te-ana-nui, a very large house, with four windows, two in front, two
behind; such a house is \[now\] called a *mata-wha*. This house was
richly carved, the pillars, the ridge, the rafters, the barge-boards,
the purlins, the battens, the central pillars, the back and front
pillars, and the front enclosure of the porch—all were carved.

   Then was erected the house of Tu-mata-uenga (11) \[god-of-war\] named
Te Roroku-o-te-rangi. This was the most sacred house of them all,
exceedingly great was its *tapu*, as much so as that of Whare-kura. Here
were kept the weapons of war, and all pertaining thereto, and to the
ritual or *karakia* \[incantation, etc.\], and the gods \[images\] of
that particular profession.

   After that was built the house of Rongo-marae-roa (14) \[god of
peace, agriculture, etc.\] named Hao-whenua. It was built as a house in
which all agricultural implements \[? and the teaching thereof\] were
deposited. These are all I remember.

 

### TANE ASCENDS TO THE UPPERMOST HEAVEN.

   After the events described above, the ascent of Tāne-nui-a-rangi (68)
to Te Toi-o-nga-rangi was considered by the gods. Whiro-te-tipua (6) was
most urgent that he should go on before; so he proceeded by way of the
Taepatanga \[edge of the sky\] of the Heavens to climb up above. Whiro
had proceeded on his way for a long distance, when Tāne told his elder
brethren, Tawhiri-matea, Tama-kaka and Tupai-a-tau that they ought to
start. So they went, aided by the family of Para-wera-nui \['a mighty
southerly tempest.'—see Journal Polynesian <span id="page_128">p.
128</span> Society, Vol. XVI., p. 58\] who carried them along
\[*taiapo*, i.e., by the legs and arms, or arm in arm\]; by way of the
Ara-tiatia \[way of steps\]. That family is as follows; it was they who
bore their parent \[Tāne—not necessarily their father\] to Te
Toi-o-nga-rangi:—

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Titi-parauri (the black whirlwind)<br />
Titi-mata-kake (the ascending whirlwind)<br />
Titi-matangi-nui (the great windy whirlwind)<br />
Titi-aru-rangi<span id="fr_33"></span><a href="#note_33">33</a> (the whirlwind ascending to heaven)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

These then were the families of Tawhiri-matea, who carried Tāne to the
Pu-motomoto \[the entrance\] of Tawhiri-rangi \[guard-house to the
uppermost heaven\]. His companions were Uru-ao (51), Rangi-ihiihi-matua
(? 27), Tu-kapua (40), Tawhiri-matea (7), Taka-wai-rangi and Te
Ataata-o-te-rangi; these last accompanied Tane to Rangi-naonao-ariki
\[the third heaven counting downwards\] to Kautu and Tapuhi-kura, who
were the spirits whose duty it was to take \[Tāne\] to Tauru-o-te-rangi
\[the name of the entrance into the third heaven\], where Tāne was
purified by Kautu and Tapuhi-kura. Tawhiri-matea, Uru-ao and
Rangi-ihiihi-matua returned from here to Earth, whilst Te
Ataata-o-te-rangi and Taka-wai-rangi carried Tāne to Tiritiri-o-matangi
\[heaven below the summit\].

   \[In the meantime\] Whiro had ascended to Rangi-nui and Rangi-tamaku
\[the two lowest heavens\] where he learnt that Tāne had passed on
before him; he followed to Rangi-parauri \[tenth heaven in descent\] but
did not overtake him. Here his son-in-law said to him, "Go back! You
cannot succeed, for that man \[Tāne\] has been consecrated above on
Maunga-nui by Rua-tau and Rehua." At this Whiro was very distressed and
wroth; he ordered the Tini-o-Poto to follow in pursuit of Tāne, they
are:—

|                                                                    |                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">O Naonao (Mosquito)   </span>                  | <span class="small">O Kēa (the great Parrot)</span>                                 |
| <span class="small">O Rō (the Ant)   </span>                       | <span class="small">O Kērangi (the Hawk)</span>                                     |
| <span class="small">O Peketua (Centipede)   </span>                | <span class="small">O Karearea (Sparrow-hawk)</span>                                |
| <span class="small">O Pepe-te-muimui (Prionoplus)   </span>        | <span class="small">O Peka (the Bat)</span>                                         |
| <span class="small">O Pekepeke-haratua (Daddy-long-legs)   </span> | <span class="small">O Poupou (the Owl)<span id="fr_34"></span>[34](#note_34)</span> |
| <span class="small">O Taunga-hua (not known)</span>                |                                                                                     |

   This was the war-party of Whiro which he sent to follow Tāne, to peck
and draw his blood—to kill him. The war-party went on and <span
id="page_129">p. 129</span> ascended the horizon of
Rangi-tiritiri-o-matangi \[first heaven below the summit\]; and there
attacked Tāne; but they could not approach near him—they were whirled
away by the Tini-o-Parauri \[the many of Parauri—the great gales\]. They
could not get near him.

   Tāne now reached Te Pu-motomoto of Tawhiri-rangi \[the guard-house of
the uppermost heaven\], and there entered the house, where were Rua-tau,
Aitu-pawa, Rehua, Puhao-rangi, Oho-mai-rangi, Te Pura-o-te-rangi, Te
Rangi-haupapa and very many other Whatu-kura \[guardian-gods of the
Supreme God Io\]. Taka-wai-rangi and Te Ataata-o-te-rangi returned from
here to Tiritiri-ki-matangi \[first heaven below the summit\] to await
the return of Tāne-nui-a-rangi.

   And also, the war-party of Whiro-te-tipua returned to
Rangi-nao-nao-ariki \[third heaven\] to await Tāne on his return.

 

### TANE RECEIVES NEW NAMES.

   Now, when Tāne entered the guard-house, Tawhiri-rangi, by way of the
*koro-pihanga*<span id="fr_35"></span>[35](#note_35) of the rearmost
part of the ridge of the house; he had now arrived at the Te
Toi-o-nga-rangi \[the summit of Heaven\]. He was taken by Rua-tau,
Pu-hao-rangi and Oho-mai-rangi to Te Wai-o-Rongo \[the waters of Rongo\]
and there again purified, and the following additional names given him:—

|                                                             |                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    <span class="small">1. Tāne-nui-a-rangi</span>           | <span class="small">(Great-Tāne-of-Heaven)</span>                   |
|    <span class="small">2. Tāne-matua</span>                 | <span class="small">(Tāne-the-parent-of-mankind—see *infra*)</span> |
|    <span class="small">3. Tāne-te-wānanga-a-rangi</span>    | <span class="small">(Tāne-who-brought-knowledge-from-Heaven)</span> |
|    <span class="small">4. Tāne-te-waiora</span>             | <span class="small">(Tāne-the-salvation)</span>                     |
|    <span class="small">5. Tāne-te-torokaha</span>           |                                                                     |
|    <span class="small">6. Tāne-tahurangi</span>             |                                                                     |
|    <span class="small">7. Tāne-maiki-roa</span>             |                                                                     |

   These are the names then given him; but the first one he had already
received from Rua-tau and Rehua, when he was sanctified on Mount
Maunganui, as already described.

 

### TANE AND IO.

   After the above occurrence, Tāne was conducted into Matangi-reia
\[the house of Io—Sun's path in the Heavens\] where Io was awaiting him.
On his arrival Io asked him:—

   "By whom are we?"<span id="fr_36"></span>[36](#note_36)

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

   "By the Sky-father and the Earth-mother is thy child, O
Io-the-father, ē ī!"

   "Who is thy companion?"

   "My elder brother, Whiro-te-tipua. He went by way of the Taepatanga
of the Heavens, to ascend."

   "Thy elder brother will not succeed; the winds of the conjoint
Heavens blow too strongly."

   Io added, "What is thy reason for ascending here?"

   "The sacred contents of the 'baskets' pertaining to the Sky-father
and Earth-mother to obtain; hence have I ascended up to thee, O Io, ē
ī!"

   Io then said, "Let us go to the Rauroha" \[space outside Io's
dwelling, the *marae* or plaza\], and when they got there, then for the
first time was seen how numerous were the Whatu-kura \[male guardian
gods\] and Marei-kura \[female guardian goddesses\] there staying. Tāne
was again purified in Rauroha, and after this had been accomplished,
they entered the temple Rangiatea \[treasure house, and the first of the
Whare-wānanga—see introduction to Chapter I.\]. It was here that the
Whatu-kuras gave into Tāne's charge, the three 'baskets' and the two
sacred stones. They were 'god-stones' \[i.e., endowed with god-like and
miraculous powers\].

 

### THE THREE 'BASKETS' AND TWO STONES.

   These are the names of the three 'baskets' and two stones:—

|       |                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    1. | The *kete-uruuru-matua*, of peace, of all goodness, of love.                                                                                                                          |
|    2. | The *kete-uruuru-rangi* (or *tipua*), of all prayers, incantations, ritual, used by mankind.                                                                                          |
|    3. | The *kete-uruuru-tau* (or *tawhito*), of the wars of mankind, agriculture, tree or wood-work, stone-work, earth-work—of all things that tend to well-being, life, of whatsoever kind. |

   \[Te Matorohanga held that the original teaching of this branch was
derived from the first created thoughts, which were good alone; it was
afterwards that evil thoughts came into being. The Creator first gave
man eyes in order to distinguish good from evil, and then the *ngakau*,
or heart, to hold such knowledge.\]

|       |                                                                |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
|    1. | Te Whatu-kura, Huka-a-tai (the translation is, Foam-of Ocean). |
|    2. | Te Whatu-kura, Rehu-tai (the translation is, White-sea-mist).  |

   These stones are both white in colour, like sea-foam, that is, they
were white according to description handed down; they are stones that
<span id="page_131">p. 131</span> may indicate either good or evil
according to man's desire. They are sacred stones, and are used at the
termination of the session of teaching, that is, the pupils are placed
thereon when the classes of the Whare-wānanga break up. After the proper
ritual of *karakia*, the stones are touched by the mouths of the
pupils,<span id="fr_37"></span>[37](#note_37) and then the classes break
up for the season.

   \[The *kete*, or 'baskets,' are the three great divisions of
knowledge taught in the Maori College; we may call each *kete* a
syllabus, which it nearly approaches, in fact, as briefly mentioned
above. The two *whatu*, or stones, are said by the Scribe to be not
ordinary stones of this earth, but were brought from Heaven. It was from
them the Whatu-kura-a-Tāne and Whatu-kura-a-Tangaroa were made. In later
times, of course, some uncommon stone would be used in the Whare-wānanga
on which the pupils stood at the final ceremony before the session
ended. It was supposed that contact with these stones gave *măna*,
power, prestige, to the matter taught, besides enforcing the same on the
memory.\]

 

### TANE RETURNS TO EARTH.

   Now, after the three 'baskets' of the *wānanga* \[knowledge\] and the
two stones had been acquired, the Whatu-kuras \[gods\] escorted
Tāne-te-wānanga (68) and his properties to the next lower Heaven.
Rua-tau, Rehua, Aitu-pawa were there, and a numerous host of other
Whatu-kuras in the company. On reaching Tiritiri-o-matangi (second
Heaven from the top) they found their friends, Taka-wai-rangi and Te
Ataata, who had been joined by the descendants of Huru-te-arangi,
daughter of Tapuhi-kura, younger brother of Rangi-tamaku \[the eleventh
Heaven below the summit\] awaiting them.

   These are that family:—

|     |                     |     |                                                           |
|-----|---------------------|----:|-----------------------------------------------------------|
|     | Titi-a-toa          |  7  | Titi-mata-kaha                                            |
|     | Titi-atamai         |     | Titi-kauru-nui                                            |
|     | Titi-matangi-nui    |     | Titi-roro-hau                                             |
|     | Titi-mata-ura       |     | Titi-te-apu-hau                                           |
|     | Titi-parauri        |     | Titi-te-apu-nui                                           |
| 6   | Titi-puhi-kura      | 12  | Titi-te-apu-parauri<span id="fr_38"></span>[38](#note_38) |

   Those are the family of Tawhiri-matea (7) \[god of winds\] and
Parawera-nui \[the stormy south wind\] who are their parents; there
<span id="page_132">p. 132</span> were many others besides. Te
Matorohanga will be able to name them all in their ranks. Tapuhi-kura
and the wife of Tarapae are the guardians of their grand-children \[the
winds\] at Te Tihi-o-manono,<span id="fr_39"></span>[39](#note_39) where
their house is named Mairiiri-kapua. The courtyard of their house is
named Marae-nui; and they amuse themselves with whip-tops, Tahua-roa
being the name of the court in which they play. The brow from which they
gaze down on to the back of their ancestor \[Rangi-to-maku, eleventh
heaven from the summit\] is named Paroro-rangi—it is in
Rangi-naonao-ariki \[the third heaven from the summit\] that this family
dwells.

   Tāne-matua (68) and his companions, the Whatu-kuras, descended until
they reached Rangi-te-wawana \[the fourth heaven from the summit\] where
they were attacked by the war-party of Whiro-te-tipu (6)—these are their
names:—

|                            |                       |
|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| 1\. Pekepeke-mata-ruwai    | 3\. Pekepeke-harakuku |
| 2\. Pekepeke-hau-rutua     | 4\. Pekepeke-riwaru   |
| 5\. Pekepeke-mata-nui      |                       |

   As soon as the war-party was discovered, it was assaulted by the
company of Tāne-matua; the war-party of Whiro (6) was defeated at Te
Rangi-haupapa, and the following brought down to earth as prisoners:—

|                                                          |                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">1. Kāhu (the Hawk)</span>            | <span class="small">5. Kakapo (the night Parrot)</span> |
| <span class="small">2. Karearea (Sparrow-Hawk)   </span> | <span class="small">6. Pekapeka (the Bat)</span>        |
| <span class="small">3. Matuku (the Crane)</span>         | <span class="small">7. Ruru (the Owl)</span>            |
| <span class="small">4. Kēa (the great Parrot)</span>     | <span class="small">8. Kakariki (Parrakeet)</span>      |

   The grandchildren of Kērangi (the hawk) were taken prisoners, they
are:—

|                                                           |                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">Waeroa (Mosquito)</span>              | <span class="small">Wēta (wingless Locust)</span>     |
| <span class="small">Namu-poto (little Sand-fly)   </span> | <span class="small">Pepe (Butterfly)</span>           |
| <span class="small">Naonao (Sand-fly)</span>              | <span class="small">Rango (Blow-fly)</span>           |
| <span class="small">Rō (the Ant)</span>                   | <span class="small">Kawhitiwhiti (Grasshopper)</span> |

and other insects of that nature. The above is the reason they were
brought here \[are found here\] on the earth.

   And now the face of Rangi-nui \[the sky above, lowest Heaven\]
flashed forth in brilliant red. Hence did Tupai (69), Uepoto (28),
Tamakaka (63), Uru-roa, Tama-te-kapua (? 44), Tu-mata-uenga (11)
Tangaroa (8), and Tawhiri-matua (7), know that the *wānanga* had been
acquired by Tāne-matua (68). Great was the joy, and the rejoicing of the
family of gods, even including those at Tu-te-aniwaniwa \[the <span
id="page_133">p. 133</span> dwelling-place of Whiro (6) and
Uru-te-ngangana (1)\]. But Whiro alone was not glad; he was continuously
angry and jealous on account of the exceeding *măna* \[power, prestige\]
that had accrued to Tāne-matua (68). And now Uru-ao (51) and Tupai took
their trumpets and sounded a fanfare; they were named 'Te
Wharara-o-te-rangi' \[the arch of Heaven\] and 'Pu-oro-rangi ' \[trumpet
sounding in Heaven\]. The whole of the family of gods heard the trumpet
blasts, and knew thereby that Tāne-matua had succeeded in his quest.

   When the party arrived at the *turuma*<span
id="fr_40"></span>[40](#note_40) of Whare-kura \[the first temple built
on earth\], and after the purification ceremony, they entered Whare-kura
and there suspended the three *wānanga* at the back of the temple, where
also the two *whatu* \[stones\] were deposited. Whiro (6) demanded that
the 'baskets' and stones should be delivered up to him. Tāne-matua (68)
said to him, "Where are others to be found if we agree to that? It is
sufficient that you have some of our elder brethren with you; the
'baskets' must be left with these members of our elder and younger
brethren." Rongo-marae-roa (14) and Uru-te-ngangana (1) both consented
to this. Whiro was very angry at this and returned home with two of the
*whatu* \[stones\].<span id="fr_41"></span>[41](#note_41) After this the
Whatu-kuras \[gods\] returned to Te Toi-o-nga-rangi \[Uppermost
Heaven\].

 

### THE GUARDIAN ANGELS OR SPIRITS ARE APPOINTED.

   Now, at this period the attention of Tāne-matua (68) and his elder
and younger brethren was turned to the separation of the Pou-tiri-ao
\[Guardian Angels\] to their different spheres of action in their
separate places, by twos and threes, to each plane of the Earth, the
Heavens, and even the Ocean. Thus was the work directed; and the
valuable contents of the three 'baskets' were distributed \[i.e., as the
baskets contained all knowledge and directions for the government of the
world and its contents, some branches were allocated to the different
guardians to enable them to rule in their separate spheres, and thus
become the presiding dieties of different classes of phenomena\]. But I
am unable to place this family in their different planes—ask Te
Matorohanga. I did not completely acquire the full knowledge of this
branch.<span id="fr_42"></span>[42](#note_42)

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

 

### THE WARS OF THE GODS.

   At this time the hatred and jealousy of Whiro (6) and his faction
towards Tāne-matua (68) had become permanent. Whiro would not give his
consent to the appointment of the Pou-tiri-ao to their respective
spheres. His elder brethren said to him, "Leave to our younger brother
the direction and the power; he has acquired the *kauwae-runga*
\[knowledge of Celestial things\]. As for you, all you have initiated
has ended in disaster, even from the very beginning down to the present
time." Much strife ensued, until Uru-te-ngangana \[the first born of the
gods\] separated himself from Whiro, and departed for the home of his
younger brother, Rongo-marae-roa (14) \[god of agriculture\] and his
party, and to Huaki-pouri \[Tāne's dwelling\]. The dissentions between
the various factions of the gods now became permanent, leading to actual
war; Whiro-te-tipua (6) was defeated; the general name for this war was
Pae-rangi, and the names of the different battles were:—

|                     |                     |      |                |
|---------------------|---------------------|-----:|----------------|
|                     | Rere-pari           | 11\. | Te Kaha-roa    |
|                     | Maunga-utahataha    |      | Moe-te-horo    |
|                     | Wai-taha            |      | Te Kārangi     |
|                     | Roro-nuku-atea      |      | Te Harotoroto  |
| 5\.                 | Te Ika-horo-mata    | 15\. | Takoto-moana   |
|                     | Te Iwi-horoa        |      | Kaikai-tangata |
|                     | Tu-rourou           |      | Taiki-nui      |
|                     | Huri-kino           |      | Ngakau-pakoa   |
|                     | Whakaahu            |      | Taheke-roa     |
| 10\.                | Katikati-aho        | 20\. | Te Au-miro     |
| 21\. Te Au-tahataha |                     |      |                |

   There were others besides; indeed, a great many in which they fought.
Some battles were on the land, some in the Heavens, some in the
intermediate space, some on the water—there was no place in which they
did not fight. Such places as they thought suitable, there they fought.
But these battles were fought as gods between gods.

   The end of it was that Whiro-te-tipua was defeated, and that was the
reason he descended to Raro-henga \[Hades\]—hence is that fatal descent
of his named Taheke-roa \[the eternal fall\]. The true \[or general\]
name of this \[series of\] battles is Te Pae-rangi. Whiro disappeared
for ever into Te Muri-wai-hou, to Raro-henga; that is, to the place
called Te Reinga.<span id="fr_43"></span>[43](#note_43)

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

 

### THE OVERTURNING OF MOTHER-EARTH.

   Before Tāne-nui-a-rangi (68) ascended by the Ara-tiatia \[the way of
steps\] to Te Toi-o-nga-rangi-taupuru \[the overhanging (overcast)
summit of Heaven—the Uppermost Heaven\], and after the Sky-father and
Earth-mother had been separated, the face \[front\] of their mother had
been overturned so that she faced Hades. The youngest child of these
parents, named Whakaru-ai-moko (70) was at that time a child at the
breast. They left this child as a comfort<span
id="fr_44"></span>[44](#note_44) for their mother. Now, hence \[through
Whakaru-ai-moko (70)\] are the earthquakes, and volcanic phenomena that
constantly war against us in every age.

   The reason why they \[the gods\] overturned the Earth to face
downwards to Rarohenga was because she continually lamented for
Rangi-nui \[the Sky-father\], and because Rangi-nui constantly lamented
over her; that is, this was the nature of her lamenting, she
continuously closed the avenues of light by means of clouds and mists,
whilst Rangi-nui constantly obscured things by his tears, both day and
night; that is, the rain was constant, never ceasing, as was the snow,
the black-frost, the driving snow. The family of gods were perishing
with the rain and the snow, and hence did they overturn their mother to
face downwards to Rarohenga. After this their condition was much
ameliorated. But they still dwelt in \[a faint light\] like the
moonlight of this earth, because neither stars, the moon, nor the sun
had been placed in position.

   The name given by Ruatau \[one of the guardians of the heavenly
treasures, a messenger of Io's\] to this world was this: He said to the
Sky-father and Earth-mother "Let your offspring go forth and dwell.
Leave them to move about on you two." He added, "Do not continue to
enclose them between \[your bodies\]. Let them go forth to
Tahora-nui-a-teu<span id="fr_45"></span>[45](#note_45) and therein move
about." Hence, we learn the name given <span id="page_136">p. 136</span>
by Ruatau to this world—'Tahora-nui-a-Ruatau.'<span
id="fr_46"></span>[46](#note_46) It was Hine-titama<span
id="fr_47"></span>[47](#note_47) that gave the \[commonly used\] name of
Te Ao-tu-roa \[the enduring light\] to this world. It was thus that her
relative, Te Kuwatawata (23) spoke to her, saying, "O Lady! Return
hence! Here ceases the world of light. Beyond me is
the-darkness-ever-present."<span id="fr_48"></span>[48](#note_48)
Hine-titama replied to him, "Let me remain there that I may catch the
living spirit of my descendants \[mankind\] in the
world-of-everlasting-light." We learn by this that Hine-titama gave this
world its name \[Te-ao-tu-roa\].

 

### THE ORDER OF CREATION.

   Now, after the wars of the gods, Whiro (6) and his younger brethren,
Tu-mata-uenga (11) and others as above written, the appointment of the
Pou-tiri-aos \[guardian spirits\] to their functions in the planes of
Rangi-nui \[the Sky-father\], Papu-tua-nuku \[the Earth-mother\], and to
Lady-ocean, was duly completed.

   And then they completed the various beings to dwell in the great
ocean, the waters of the earth, the trees, not to mention the reptiles
\[or insects\], for they are really the lice of the Earth-mother; hence,
are they called Te Whanau-a-Torohuka \[the family (or descendants) of
Torohuka\]. At this time came the command of Rua-tau and Rehua \[two of
the guardians of the Heavenly treasures and messengers of Io\] to
Tāne-matua (68) saying: "Honour the offspring of Torohuka and Muhumuhu
as friends for you all. Some are evil, some are good." The words of
those two Whatu-kuras referred to the *ngarara* \[reptiles, insects\];
for they were the first created of all living things. Thus:—

|                                   |                                                                                                                                                                             |
|----------------------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                1. | The waters of ocean that are in the world, were created by waters; and then grew \[out of them\] the land, the Earth which on maturity was taken to wife by the Sky-father. |
|                                2. | Next \[were created\] the minor vegetation, growing each after its own kind.                                                                                                |
|                                3. | Next \[were created\] the trees of every kind, to clothe the skin of the Earth, which had theretofore been naked.                                                           |
|                                4. | Next \[were created\] the reptiles and insects of every kind.                                                                                                               |
|                                5. | Next \[were created\] the animals, dogs, of every species.                                                                                                                  |
|                                6. | Next \[were created\] the birds of different kinds to dwell on the plains and in the woods of the Earth, and on Lady-ocean also.                                            |
| <span id="page_137">p. 137</span> |                                                                                                                                                                             |
|                                7. | Next \[were created\] the moon, the sun, and all the stars. When this had been accomplished, the 'World of Light' became permanent.                                         |
|                                8. | Next \[and finally were created\] Hine-ahu-one \[the first woman\] and \[her daughter\] Hine-titama; from whom mankind in this world sprung.                                |

   By these all, from the very first down to the \[creation of\] man,
mentioned each in its own period, growing up in their own time,
increasing in their periods, living in their own periods, each conceived
after their own manner and time, of whatsoever nature; each had its own
time of conception, or sprouting. We now understand that this was the
nature of all things, and, each thing has it female \[counterpart\]
through which it conceives; whatever there is, it has a wife \[female\];
there is nothing that stands alone without its female—all things have
their female counterparts.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_116">p. 116</span>

<span id="note_1"></span>[1](#fr_1). All these winds are exceedingly
obstructive in their action, says the Scribe.

<span id="note_2"></span>[2](#fr_2). These are the guardian gods of the
treasure house of the Uppermost Heaven, and appear to rank above the
other Whatu-kura, or guardian gods. The names of Ruatau and Aitu-pawa
were very sacred, and very seldom mentioned on that account, whilst
Rehua and the others were very much less sacred.

<span id="footnotes_page_117">p. 117</span>

<span id="note_3"></span>[3](#fr_3). A species of bivalve, the Scribe
has forgotten which.

<span id="note_4"></span>[4](#fr_4). The Scribe says that the teaching
of the Whare-wānanga was, that the eyes were first created in order that
the gods might distinguish good from evil, and after that the *ngakau*,
or heart, wherein this knowledge might be retained.

<span id="note_5"></span>[5](#fr_5). Then follows five words which the
Scribe could not explain, but two of them mean soft.

<span id="footnotes_page_118">p. 118</span>

<span id="note_6"></span>[6](#fr_6). This long description refers to the
condition of the gods, the offspring of Heaven and Earth, before they
burst out of the darkness involved in the close embrace of the
Sky-father and Earth-mother.

<span id="note_7"></span>[7](#fr_7). Also Tangaroa-whakamau-tai, or
Tangaroa-a-mua.

<span id="footnotes_page_119">p. 119</span>

<span id="note_8"></span>[8](#fr_8). The foregoing list has been taken
from Te Matorohanga's teaching, for old Pohutu says he had forgotten
some, but that the former priest would sure to be right. The numbers
opposite each name will enable the reader to identify them in the
narratives which follow. Seventy is the proper number of these secondary
gods.

<span id="note_9"></span>[9](#fr_9). Professors Nettleship and Sandys in
their 'Dictionary of Classical Antiquities,' say of Chaos: "Chăŏs,
according to Hesiod, the yawning, unfathomable abyss, which was the
first of all existing things. From Chaos arose Gaia (Earth), Tatărus
(Hell) and Erōs (Love). Chaos bore Erĕbus and Night; from their union
sprung Æthĕr and Hēmĕra (Sky and Day). The conception of Chaos as the
confused mass out of which, in the beginning, the separate forms of
things arose, is erroneous, and belongs to a later period." We shall see
as we proceed how much the Maori belief is like this in many respects.

<span id="note_10"></span>[10](#fr_10). These ages do not agree with Te
Matorohanga's teaching, which, however, as they give more detail, and
hence, perhaps, will aid in understanding their significance, I give at
the end of this chapter in an appendix.

<span id="note_11"></span>[11](#fr_11). It is nearly always the youngest
of the family that is the hero in Maori legends. The youngest of all
these gods was at this time a baby at the breast.—See *infra*.

<span id="footnotes_page_120">p. 120</span>

<span id="note_12"></span>[12](#fr_12). Te Matorohanga says, they found
an exit between Papa's legs, which explains the above.

<span id="note_13"></span>[13](#fr_13). The Scribe tells me that the
doctrine of the Whare-wānanga was, that all space above the earth was
subject to intense cold (*anu-winiwini*), The names given are
emblematical for different degrees of cold, for shivering, etc. At the
same time the two first are Star names.

<span id="note_14"></span>[14](#fr_14). Presumably the gods that dwell
in the eleven heavens, and their human descendants.

<span id="footnotes_page_121">p. 121</span>

<span id="note_15"></span>[15](#fr_15). The form of Mother Earth is
conceived to be that of a female with her head lying to the east, her
legs to the west.

<span id="note_16"></span>[16](#fr_16). Paia is not mentioned in Te
Matorohanga's list of the gods, though it is well-known he was one of
them who played an important part; probably, he had another name as
well—possibly Tu-pai.

<span id="note_17"></span>[17](#fr_17). In the course of this narrative,
in the Historical part, we shall come across these axes again. The Maori
belief is, that they were brought to New Zealand in the canoe
'Takitimu,' in A.D. 1350, and the first of the two is still in the
possession of the Nga-Rauru tribe, West Coast of North Island.—See
'Journal Polynesian Society,' Vol. IX., p. 229, for the full history of
the axe as far as known, and also the song about it. It is, according to
description, quite a different shape, size and material to the ordinary
Maori axes. It is so sacred, no white man has been allowed to see it.

<span id="footnotes_page_122">p. 122</span>

<span id="note_18"></span>[18](#fr_18). The *Ahi-tapu* was the fire
raised by the ordinary Polynesian method of rubbing a pointed stick
(*ure*) in a grove in another stick (*kaunoti*). These sticks were
habitually carried suspended from the neck either in front or at the
back, to keep them quite dry and warm; contact with the body made them
*tapu*, hence, Ahi-tapu, sacred fire. So says the Scribe; but I do not
think the term was applied to any ordinary fire, but only to those made
for ritualistic purposes.

<span id="note_19"></span>[19](#fr_19). *Horu*, clay permeated by the
oxide of iron, when burnt was used to paint houses, canoes, &c., and the
face. *Pukepoto* is a brilliant blue clay, a fossil in fact, permeated
by the phosphate (? proto-phosphate) of iron, and was used to paint a
blue horizontal streak across the face for adornment. How these old
people came to associate the brilliant blue with red blood, is not
explained.

<span id="note_20"></span>[20](#fr_20). There are two species of Apa:
the Apa-atua were minor gods, and were the messengers of the other gods.
Apa is also a whirlwind, which is the bodily form of the former, who
were spirits. Apa also means a company. It will be noticed that the Sage
includes the Whatu-kura and Marei-kura within the class of Apa-atua, or
god-Apas.

<span id="footnotes_page_123">p. 123</span>

<span id="note_21"></span>[21](#fr_21). The Scribe tells me that this
word, which ordinarily means a month, here refers ro the Kaupeka-o-runga
(Celestial things), and the Kaupeka-o-raro (Terrestrial things), and
that the months derive their names from it. Judging from subsequent
statements it here means 'the knowledge of things Celestial and
Terrestrial.'

<span id="note_22"></span>[22](#fr_22). Tama-kaka is not in Te
Matorohanga's list; probably it is a second name—possibly number
sixty-three.

<span id="footnotes_page_124">p. 124</span>

<span id="note_23"></span>[23](#fr_23). See previous [note number
thirteen](#note_13), where emblematical names are given to the cold. The
Scribe tells me that Te Matorohanga taught that *anu-winiwini* (extreme
cold) expressed a cold that human beings never experience, that all
space above the earth is subject to this extreme cold; and that when
Rangi and Papa were separated, the escape of their bodily heat carried
the cold upwards.

<span id="note_24"></span>[24](#fr_24). This last statement is obscure,
but, probably means, they were the most intelligent or daring.
Maunga-nui is apparently another name for the sacred mountain in
Hawaiki-nui, the Fatherland, called at the end of Chapter II.,
Tawhiti-nui (the great elevated, or uprising mountain), up which the
spirits of the dead on their way to the uppermost Heaven ascended and
were there purified. One cannot help noticing the apparent connection of
this mountain with the Kailasa, so well described by Sven Haydn in
north-west Thibet.

<span id="footnotes_page_125">p. 125</span>

<span id="note_25"></span>[25](#fr_25). The ascending clouds. The
spirits ascended by this means on their way to the uppermost Heaven
where Io dwelt, says the Scribe.

<span id="note_26"></span>[26](#fr_26). Taepatanga, is 'where the sky
hangs down,' and joins the earth according to Maori ideas, i.e., in
modern times, the limit of vision, the horizon and the bounding sky.
*Tai-hiti, tai-wawa*, are expressions for difficulty or impossibility.

<span id="footnotes_page_126">p. 126</span>

<span id="note_27"></span>[27](#fr_27). The word used is *ahu-turangi*,
which, says the Scribe, describes the beauty and expanse of Heaven.

<span id="note_28"></span>[28](#fr_28). Two names for the ascent. The
first is said to have steps, the second means the 'ascending clouds,'
according to the Scribe. But I have heard the second name translated as
the "swaying line, or rope." It occurs with other traditions.

<span id="note_29"></span>[29](#fr_29). This is a place in
Rangi-naonao-ariki, the third Heaven from the summit. "It is here the
offspring of Tawhiri-matea dwell; they are the various winds"—says the
Scribe. The historical Tihi-o-manono, probably, in Samoa, Fiji, or
Tonga, was named after this place.

<span id="note_30"></span>[30](#fr_30). These three are the 'currents'
by which spirits descend to Hades—here used, probably, as meaning, let
him try, and meet his death.

<span id="note_31"></span>[31](#fr_31). *Tahū*, explained as, the
origin, summit, very commencement of all knowledge, and, hence is
*tahuhu*, a ridge pole, as being above all in a house. Hence, also,
teaching, doctrine, law.

<span id="footnotes_page_127">p. 127</span>

<span id="note_32"></span>[32](#fr_32). Neither of them are of the
family of Rangi and Papa. The second name denotes that he was a very
learned man; one may venture to translate the name as 'the receptacle of
increasing knowledge.'

<span id="footnotes_page_128">p. 128</span>

<span id="note_33"></span>[33](#fr_33). The Titi are explained by the
Scribe as emblematical names for the ascending whirlwinds, otherwise
called *awhiowhio*. By their aid Tāne ascended by the Ara-tiatia: they
were lent to him by Tawhiri-matea, god of winds.

<span id="note_34"></span>[34](#fr_34). The introduction of the 'O'
before these names is strange and unlike Maori—it would almost seem that
they had been derived from one of the branches of the Polynesians who
use 'O' for 'Ko.'

<span id="footnotes_page_129">p. 129</span>

<span id="note_35"></span>[35](#fr_35). Koro-pihanga is a round window,
says the Scribe; a thing unknown in modern Maori architecture.

<span id="note_36"></span>[36](#fr_36). This is part of the usual
ceremonious and polite form of address between two strangers to one
another. There are several amusing stories which bear on this.

<span id="footnotes_page_131">p. 131</span>

<span id="note_37"></span>[37](#fr_37). It will be noticed that Pohuhu
says *touched*, whilst Te Matorohanga says *swallowed*.

<span id="note_38"></span>[38](#fr_38). All these Titi are emblematical
names for different kinds of whirlwinds, by whose aid Tāne ascended to
and descended from the uppermost Heaven.

<span id="footnotes_page_132">p. 132</span>

<span id="note_39"></span>[39](#fr_39). Not to be confounded with the
historical place of that name; this is in the heavens. See [note
twenty-nine](#note_29) in this Chapter.

<span id="footnotes_page_133">p. 133</span>

<span id="note_40"></span>[40](#fr_40). As before pointed out, this was
where prayers, etc., were offered up, but means also the latrine.

<span id="note_41"></span>[41](#fr_41). The stones brought down by Tāne
were afterwards recovered—see *infra*.

<span id="note_42"></span>[42](#fr_42). For description of the
Pou-tiri-ao, see Chapter II.

<span id="footnotes_page_134">p. 134</span>

<span id="note_43"></span>[43](#fr_43). Te Reinga, the boundary between
this world and the next, the 'jumping off' place, of which there is one
in every group of Polynesia, where the spirits <span
id="footnotes_page_135">p. 135</span> passed to the west on their way to
the Fatherland. Tahekeroa means the 'long rapid,' the eternal fall;
i.e., of the evil spring Whiro, to eternal banishment in the realms of
Hades. The three names connected herewith, Au-rona, Au-miro, and
Au-kume—the wide-spread, dragging and swirling currents—express the idea
of the current of death that is ever active in hauling mankind to death.
Muri-wai-hou expresses the idea of the mouth of a river descending iuto
a chasm, possibly connected with the Scandinavian and Grecian idea of
the river that has to be crossed before Hades is reached—the Styx.
Raro-henga, the utter confusion of mind of those who descend to Hades.

<span id="note_44"></span>[44](#fr_44). Tānga-manawa, is the word used.
It ordinarily means to take breath, to rest.

<span id="note_45"></span>[45](#fr_45). Great-wide-open-space, says the
Scribe.

<span id="footnotes_page_136">p. 136</span>

<span id="note_46"></span>[46](#fr_46).
The-great-spread-out-space-of-Ruatau.

<span id="note_47"></span>[47](#fr_47). About whom we shall learn later
on: she was Tāne's daughter.

<span id="note_48"></span>[48](#fr_48). Te Kuwatawata was the guardian
of the door of Hades, one of the gods (23). We shall learn much of him
later.
