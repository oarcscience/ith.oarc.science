## CHAPTER V.

> <span class="small">The Pō, or ages of darkness—Astronomical Notes—The
> Months and Days—More Astronomical Notes.</span>

\[I<span class="small">N</span> this Chapter a translation of the Sage's
remarks on the Pō, the cosmological ages of darkness, during which the
family of the Sky-father and Earth-mother dwelt, prior to their exit to
the world of light, is given as well as the succeeding Pō of Hades. But
the subject is extremely difficult; the ideas of the old Maoris cannot
well be translated, for the saw things from a different standpoint to
ours. The Pō of Hades appears to represent the everlasting darkness to
which (some of) the spirits of mankind are relegated on passing from
this world to the next, and which is constantly referred to in song and
story when someone has died by saying, 'He has gone to the Pō—to
everlasting night.'

   The Astronomical part is mostly from Te Matorohanga's teaching. It is
obscure in places, and I think it possible that the Scribe occasionally
omitted some remark that would have thrown light on these parts that are
not clear.\]

 

### THE PO.

TE Matorohanga says:—I have already explained about Pō \[the ages or
æons of cosmological darkness before the birth of the gods\]. There are
two divisions of these Pō: the first is that during which the offspring
of Rangi \[the Sky-father\] and Papa \[the Earth-mother\] dwelt in the
Pō, and eventually became desirous of breaking forth from the embrace of
their parents to the Whai-ao \[the World of Being\] and the Ao-marama
\[the World of Light\]. That has already been dealt with (see [p.
119](lww3.htm#page_119)).

   The second series of the Pō commenced when Hine-nui-te-Pō \[Great
Lady of the night, goddess of Hades\] passed through the *angi*<span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#note_1) to Pou-tere-rangi \[the Guard-house of
Hades\] (see [p. 153](lww4.htm#page_153)), and then the second series of
Pō became permanent in Rarohenga \[Hades\]. Hence it is that the Pō has
become the 'way of descent' for those of the 'world of being' to Hades;
and these Pō are named Te-Pō-tē-kitea <span id="page_162">p. 162</span>
\[the unseen Pō\], Te Pō-tē-whaia \[non-possessed Pō\], Te Pō-tē-wheau
\[the Pō-that passes not\], Te Pō-tangotango \[the Pō of utter
darkness\], and Te Pō-tē-whawha \[the Pō that cannot be touched\], in
Rarohenga. All these Pō were dedicated \[or consecrated, or separated
off\] to Te Ku-watawata (23) \[Guardian of the entrance to Hades\] to
Rarohenga. \[It was after this\] that mankind ceased to visit Rarohenga
in the body, as described in the account of the return of Mataaho and
Niwareka<span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#note_2) from there. All of these Pō
have been assigned to womankind when they give birth to the 'germ of
man' to the world, as has been explained.<span
id="fr_3"></span>[3](#note_3) Consequently, if any man claims to
commence his pedigree from these Pō, it is wrong—impossible. Secondly,
we have seen that there are seventy members of the family born of Rangi
and Papa (see [p. 118](lww3.htm#page_118)); some of whose offspring gave
birth to the 'germ of gods' into this world, and some the 'germ of man,'
whilst some others produced rocks, reptiles, etc.

   Let me abbreviate this subject by saying, that there was not one of
the family of Rangi and Papa that had not offspring in the 'everlasting
world.' The division of that family into the Pou-tiri-ao
\[guardian-spirits\] of the conjoint Heavens, eleven in number, with
their special spheres of action, even down to
Papa-tua-nuku-matua-te-kore \[the Parentless Earth-mother\] has been
explained. Their duties have been made clear, for there is nothing
whatever that has not some function to perform: The Pō, the world, each
has its \[assigned\] work to do. The many Pō and the "germ of gods" have
been assigned to the 'Family of Pekerau' (29) (see pp.
[132](lww3.htm#page_132), [157](lww4.htm#page_157)); and the world has
been assigned to the 'germ of man' \[i.e, the Heavens; the Space is the
domain of the gods, whilst the Earth is that of mankind\].

 

### ASTRONOMICAL NOTES.

   Te Matorohanga says:—Tāne appointed some of his elder brethren to be
stationed both on the back and on the front of their common parent \[the
Sky-father\], thus:—

Uru-te-ngangana (1)    Roiho (2)    Roake (3)

   These were the occupiers of Pou-tiri-ao, the house that held the
*kaupeka* \[months\] of the year \[i.e., those gods ruled over and
arranged the phenomena of time\]. It was hence the 'Tatai-aro-rangi '
\[i.e., <span id="page_163">p. 163</span> science of astromony and
time\] was possible, to guide the 'Whanau-Puhi-ariki' \[sun, moon, and
stars family\]; that is, what the white-men call an almanac; such is the
'Tatai-aro-rangi,' the arrangement of the sun, moon, and stars \[in
their proper seasons, courses, etc.\].

   Some of the family of Rangi and Papa are \[always\] moving about in
the Planes of the Eleven Heavens, arranging and directing the
'Tatai-aro-rangi' of the Ao-rangi-puaroa \[the visible Heavens\]. And it
is in consequence of this that the sun, moon, and their younger brethren
the stars \[that denote the seasons\] of the year move correctly;
together with the *whetu-punga*<span id="fr_4"></span>[4](#note_4) that
lie in the Ika-o-te-rangi \[the Fish-of-Heaven, or the
Backbone-of-Heaven\] in the 'Great-ridge-of-Heaven' \[both names for the
Milky Way\].

   Tāne also appointed Raka-maomao (13), Kaukau (22) and Haepuru (4) to
confine \[or guard\] the bounds of Ranginui-a-tamaku \[the Heaven above
us\], as a place in which the various gods of the Heavens might move
about, and where could be obtained the plumes used by the Whatu-kuras,
Marei-kuras, Ruaos, and other Apas \[different classes of gods\]. It was
from the following birds the plumes were obtained:—

Hakuai, Tapu-turangi, Koreke-rangi, Takahi-kare,  
Kaukau-rangi, Kura-a-rangi, and Rakorakoa (or Amokura).

   All these birds were very *tapu*; it was their tail-feathers that
were used as plumes for the gods mentioned above. There are three other
birds not included in the above; they were brought down from Heaven by
Tawhaki in order to produce plumes for his wife Maikuku-makaka; they
were, the Kotuku \[crane\], the Huia, and the Koekoeā
\[long-tailed-cuckoo\].<span id="fr_5"></span>[5](#note_5)

   The work assigned to these sacred birds was to announce to each
*marae* \[court\] or dwelling-place on earth, the first month of the
year, Orongo-nui of the Ngahuru-tu-hoehoe \[both names for summer\].

   It is clear from what has been said that Te Iho-rangi (10) had been
<span id="page_164">p. 164</span> appointed as the Pou-tiri-ao
\[guardian-spirit\] for the Planes of the Sky-father and Earth-mother,
together with his friends, to guard the clouds—clothing of their father.
Whilst he was there, he placed his grandchildren \[Pāra, Ngoiro, Tuna,
and Tuere—see [p. 155](lww4.htm#page_155)\] in the \[Heavenly\] river
named Waihau \[? the river in the constellation Eridanus\].

   It must be understood that the 'glowing sun' and his younger brethren
had been arranged in due order on their ancestor the Sky-father. In
consequence of the heat of the sun the waters of the Planes became
putrid, and in consequence thereof Matuku-whakapu \[a crane\] was able
to peck Pāra \[the barracuta fish\] and his brethren, through the
shallowness of the water. This became the cause why Pāra and others came
down to Earth to dwell.

   \[The Sage adds the following to illustrate the above, though it
really belongs to the story of Tawhaki—the Greek Peleus\]. They met
Tawhaki and his brother Karihi when they went to Ahurangi \[the name of
the way by which Tawhaki ascended\] by the Ara-tukutuku \[the spider's
way\] where Karihi was killed and Tawhaki ascended up to the brow at
Tahu-rangi \[some place in the Heavens\], and there met Pāra and his
brethren on their way down to Earth. Tawhaki asked them, "Why are you
leaving the upper regions?" Pāra replied, "All the waters have become
quite shallow and are putrid; and consequently Matuku-whakapu \[the
crane\] was able to peck us. We are going down to Earth. How is it down
there?" Tawhaki said, "You can go now, it is all right down below."
Tawhaki then went on until he reached the Pae-angiangi \[the summit
where he rested to take breath\], where he met Matuku-whakapu \[the
crane\] and Pakura \[the water-hen, *Porphyrio melanotis*\], of whom
Tawhaki asked, "Where are you two going?" "We are going down below, to
seek a cool place; we are about killed up here by Tama-nui-te-ra \[the
sun\]; there is no water left." Tawhaki looked at Pakura and said, "Thy
forehead has been skinned; the blood is flowing."<span
id="fr_6"></span>[6](#note_6) Matuku here interposed, "It is nothing; it
is merely the result of a quarrel with Tama-i-waho, because Pakura ate
the *unio* shell-fish in the former's spring, and so Tama-i-waho
stripped the skin off Pakura's forehead." And then Tawhaki ascended up
to the dwelling of his ancestress Whaitiri. . . . . . .

   \[The reader must not set this episode down as a childish fable. It
is an important myth, the meaning of which the translator hopes to find
time to explain some time.\]

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

   Now, the family of Rangi and Papa \[the gods\] from the time they
went forth from the embrace of their parents, down to the period of the
Pae-rangi war (see [p. 134](lww3.htm#page_134)), and to the time of the
appointment of Pou-tiri-ao \[the guardian-spirits\], were all dwelling
within a kind of twilight. The reason of this was, there was no sun, no
moon, no stars, no clouds. \[Here one of the listeners to the Sage's
teaching, named Pere, asked, "O Moi! Whence then were the clouds on
which Tāne, Ruatau, Rehua and others descended?" The Sage replied, "They
were from Tiritiri-o-matangi \[next Heaven below the summit\]; those
were the first \[used\] to take them down to Rangi-naonao-ariki \[the
third Heaven from above\]. Those clouds were returned by the Apa-rangi,
and then they continued their descent on the clouds of
Rangi-naonao-ariki to Rangi-te-wiwini, and so on down to Rangi-tamaku
and Papa \[the Earth\]. When Tāne propped up the Heavens these clouds
remained up above."\]

   In consequence of this want of light Tāne ordered that the
Whanau-ariki, or Whanau-puhi \[the sun, moon and stars\] should be
brought from their dwelling on Maunga-nui \[mountain\], where they had
been stationed by Tāne and his elder brethren at Rangi-tukia. The
residence of that family there was not at all pleasant, for they could
only see very indistinctly, and their eyes constantly watered. So it was
thought better to convey them to the belly of their father, Rangi-nui,
and there affix them so that the Earth might be lit up. Then Kewa (9)
asked of Tāne-matua (68), "Who, above on Maunga-nui, is in charge of
that family?" Tāne replied, "They are with Whiro-taringa-waru,
Tongatonga (42), Tawhiri-rangi (15), and Ikaroa (12) suspended within
the house at Rangi-tukia."

   When Kewa (9) arrived at \[the base of\] Maunga-nui he said unto
Tongatonga, "The family of gods have finally decided that the family in
your charge here are to be taken and affixed to the front of their
ancestor, and there remain to adorn the front of Rangi-nui-a-tamaku
\[the Sky-father\]." To this the guardians of that family consented;
they were also the feeders of that family.

   Then Tongatonga (42) and Kewa (9) ascended Maunga-nui, and looking
down from there they saw the family amusing themselves on the sands at
Te Rehu-roa. They were called to come up to \[the summit of\]
Maunga-nui. Their mode of progression was by rolling over and over up
the mountain; the reason for which was that they were shaped like an
eye, they had no bodies. When they reached the court-yard \[named\]
Takapau-rangi, they disappeared into their house, Rangi-tukia; and then
Taringa-waru, Tawhiri-rangi, Te Ikaroa, and <span id="page_166">p.
166</span> Tongatonga took four 'baskets' in which to place the
'family.' These 'baskets' were named:—

|        |                                                                                                                                 |                                                       |                                 |                                                                                     |

   Those are all of them. It is said that Puaroa is the same as
Rere-ahiahi \[another name for Venus, but it might also refer to any
other of the brighter planets that set in the evening\], for it appears
at the same time, and when it reaches the path of the Ruddy-Sun, the
moon appears, and then Puaroa is called Kopu. When it appears at the
time daylight opens up it gets its third name, Tawera. It is, however,
the one same star. This is the star to whom was given the management or
direction of the months of the year<span id="fr_9"></span>[9](#note_9)
\[To illustrate this<span id="fr_10"></span>[10](#note_10)\] it was
correct of Ruatapu to say to Paikea at the incident known as 'Te
Whiri-pure-i-ata,' "Go in peace, and when you arrive ashore tell the
people that Wehi-nui-a-mamao<span id="fr_11"></span>[11](#note_11) will
indicate the season. Let them look to the white throat feathers of the
Tūi bird, the offspring of Para-uri (47) in the twelfth month in the
long nights of winter, then shall I be there." To cut short the story,
the above relates to the 'Flood of Ruatapu,' when many men died on
Earth, whilst those who <span id="page_167">p. 167</span> believed in
the prediction saved themselves by fleeing to the summit of Hikurangi
mountain; the unbelievers all perished.

   Now the smaller stars \[in the fourth 'basket'\] were placed in the
canoe named 'Uruao,' which is to be seen as a pattern in the sky, so
they might be guarded, lest they be maltreated by their elder brethren,
and fall down below. Tama-rere-ti was appointed their guardian.<span
id="fr_12"></span>[12](#note_12)

   After this the family of stars, etc., were conveyed to the presence
of their ancestor Rangi-nui \[the Sky-father\], and were then arranged
so that they might light up their ancestor's front surface, and to give
light also to the Earth-mother. Te Ikaroa (12) \[one of the gods, but ?
does it not mean here the Milky Way, for which it is one of the names\],
Rongo-mai-taha-rangi (62) and Rongo-mai-taha-nui (54) were sent to lay
down the *ara-matua*,<span id="fr_13"></span>[13](#note_13) and the
*kaupeka* \[months\], as the path along which the family of stars might
traveI \[correctly\] lest they collided with one another. Te Ikaroa
\[the Milky Way\] was appointed to the Zodiac, as guardians of the minor
stars and those of the Whanau-punga (see [note 4](#note_4)). The second
name of Te Ikaroa-o-te-rangi \[the-main-ridge-of-the-Heavens\] was there
given \[to the Milky Way\]; and Rongo-mai-taha-rangi (62) was placed on
the right hand side of the Milky Way to guard the Ruddy-sun, whilst
Rongo-mai-taha-nui (54) was stationed on the left hand to guard Autahi
\[Aldebaran\] and his younger brethren (see [p. 166](#page_166)). The
Waxing Moon was placed behind the Sun and the Stars.

   Now, the family of the Earth-mother considered this arrangement, and
saw that it was not a good one, because the Waxing Moon was in the dark,
as were the other minor Stars. So they separated the elder brother \[the
Sun\] and placed him on the head of Rangi \[the Sky-father\], and the
moon and stars on his belly. They then carefully examined<span
id="fr_14"></span>[14](#note_14) \[this second arrangement\], and saw
that it was not satisfactory either, and the reason was, that there was
only one phase—there was nothing but continuous daylight; for all the
'family' of stars were in one heap. And then they changed it so that the
elder <span id="page_168">p. 168</span> brother, the Ruddy-Sun, was
stationed on the back of the Sky-father, and the Waxing Moon and the
Stars on his belly, there to remain fixed. Again the family of the
Earth-mother examined the arrangement, with the Sun on the navel
(*pito*) \[the Ecliptic\]<span id="fr_15"></span>[15](#note_15) of the
Sky-father, and the Moon and the Stars on his back, so that the sun
might climb up by the thighs of the Sky-father, and the Moon and Stars
follow him; and thus was the Sun separated from his younger brethren.

   And now, for the first time, was seen night and day; and this
\[arrangement\] was named the Ao-mamara \[the world-of-light\] in which
the Sun travelled \[across the sky\], also, the Ao-marama-nui \[the
great-world-of-light\] and the Ao-marama-roa \[the
enduring-world-of-light.\] The reason of this was, there was no night or
darkness during the period that the Moon and Stars ruled the night, and
this was called the Po-nui \[the great-night\], the Po-roa \[the
enduring-night\], and the Po-tamaku \[the night-smothered-off\]. But
suffice it to say, that the third arrangement gave rise to the
separation of the darkness from the daylight, and they were called night
and day. The day was called 'the world-of-light.'

   But enough of this explanation; it is an extremely lengthy subject
were I to expatiate on it, that is, about each star and its functions.
The Ruddy-Sun at the beginning of the year proceeds by the Marua-roa
\[the winter solstice\] to the head of his ancestor \[the Sky-father\],
and when he reaches his 'shoulders' he returns to the *hiku mutu* of his
ancestor. The *hiku mutu* is the Maru-roa-o-te-Takurua \[the winter
solstice\], and the Marua-roa at the 'shoulder' is the
Marua-roa-o-te-Orongonui, or summer \[solstice\]: the *hiku mutu* is the
winter.<span id="fr_16"></span>[16](#note_16)

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

### THE MONTHS AND DAYS.

   Now, let this be clear: Matohi \[one of the Stars\] occasionally
disputes with Tangaroa-whakapau \[a day that appears to be intercalated
after the 25th\] between themselves \[as to which should enter <span
id="page_170">p. 170</span> the Calendar\]; sometimes one, sometimes the
other enters.<span id="fr_18"></span>[18](#note_18) If Tangaroa-whakapau
enters, then fish both of the sea and inland are plentiful. If Matohi
enters into the enumeration, Tangaroa-whakapau is omitted, and the neap
tide takes place, the fish direct their courses to the sea; it is the
same inland, the fish retire to Lady-morass, to Lady-swamp; and only
when Te Iho-rangi (10) drives them out do they return to the rivers. It
is the same at sea, the Tamateas drive ashore the *retoreto-moana*<span
id="fr_19"></span>[19](#note_19); that is, the wind does so. And, hence
is this period \[i.e., from 23rd to 25th\] called Tamatea-kai-ariki
\[Tamatea-chief-eater, because the bad weather at that time often
capsizes the canoes and chiefs are drowned\]. Tamatea-ngana \[the
obstinate Tamatea\], Tamatea-whakapau \[Tamatea the consumer\] and
Tamatea-aio \[the calm Tamatea\]—these are all the Tamateas—they are the
bad days in the calendar of the month, no canoe-bow will be directed

   \[The above is the second method of counting the months by numbers,
for all the names after Marua-roa express the ordinary numbers. There is
an apparent confusion in the Scribe's marginal numbers for they do not
agree with the same expressed in writing; it would be apparently more
correct if Marua-roa \[the winter solstice\] were opposite June and
July. June is usually said to be the commencement of the year, denoted
by the rising of Matariki, or the Pleiades.\]

 

### MORE ASTRONOMICAL NOTES.

   \[Nepia Pohuhu has the following on astronomical subjects:—\] Now if
the flight of the Sun, Moon, and all their younger brethren, the Stars,
is directed towards the head of Rangi-nui \[the Sky-father\], that is
the Waru-tu-hoehoe \[mid-summer\], if they come towards the legs of
Rangi-nui, that is the Takurua-Waipu \[mid-winter\]. The *pito*
\[Ecliptic\] is the boundary on their parent, their ancestor; and that
is the demarkation between winter and summer. Now the head of Rangi is
to the north, and his legs to the south, towards Para-wera-nui \[the
fierce south wind\], and, hence are the 'southers' so bad.<span
id="fr_22"></span>[22](#note_22)

   Some people say that the Sun and Moon disputed; the Sun said they
should both go together in the daylight, whilst the Moon said they ought
to operate at night. They were both obstinate, till at last the Sun
said, "Enough! You travel by night so that you may be a light to mankind
to make their earth-ovens." The Moon replied, "A! Go you by daylight so
that you may dry women's menstruous cloths." But this story is wrong, it
is a mere fable. The correct story is that of Tuatara and the shark
\[for which see [p. 156](lww4.htm#page_156)\].

   \[Nepia Pohuhu says further:—\] This is another word of mine, about
which all must be clear; in reference to the *whatu* \[? the eye\] of
the Whanau-puhi that have been mentioned; that is, Tama-nui-te-ra \[the
Sun\] and Te Marama-i-whanake \[the waxing Moon\], and their younger
brethren the Stars. Rona,<span id="fr_23"></span>[23](#note_23) Te
Ahurangi, and Te Rangi-taupiri are their Pou-tiri-ao \[guardian
spirits\]. It is they who regulate the Moon. Tāne-matua (68) said, "Let
the Moon regulate the <span id="page_172">p. 172</span> high and low
tides of Lady-ocean." Tupai added, "And the Tuahiwi-o-Hine-moana \[the
Ridge-of-Lady-ocean\] shall regulate the great waves, in order that the
descent may be easy on both sides."<span
id="fr_24"></span>[24](#note_24) Tupai then advised Tāne to appoint some
Stars to arrange \[or guide\] the Tuahiwi-o-Hine-moana, and assist the
Moon—this was done.

   This, also, must be clearly understood: Everything is a part
\[*wahi*\] of the Heavens and the Earth; there is nothing of which it
can be said, it is of the Earth alone or of Heaven alone; all things
have been placed, each in its own position and after its own kind by
them and their offspring \[the gods\], and, hence it is \[we say\] all
things eminate from them—the Stars, the Moon, the Sun—all of those are
part \[*wahi*\] of the Earth and Heaven. It is the same in all the
Eleven Heavens, just as has been said above; they have their Stars,
Moon, and Sun. Each Star, each Moon, each Sun in the Eleven Heavens has
its own Pou-tiri-ao \[guardian spirit\]. Everything is a world—a part of
the Earth and Heaven as explained. Water is the cause of growth of all
things; if there were no water, or the sea, everything would go wrong in
the Heavens, the Stars, Moon and the Sun. The coadjutor of the water is
the Sun, the Moon and the Stars. The clouds are the mist, the breath,
the warmth of Earth; for everything has heat and cold according to its
kind. Tama-nui-te-ra \[the Sun\] and Tawhiri-matea (7) \[god of winds\]
send down the clouds and mists in the form of rain to refresh all things
according to their kind—everything drinks water; there is water in all
Stars, the Moon and the Sun. . . . . .

   \[The Sage then goes on to describe the 'nature of things' generally,
which is a repetition of what has been given in Chapter III. He then
proceeds:—\]

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

   Now, in consequence of Io having so decreed, together with the
Whatu-kuras, in the world and the Pō \[Hades\] as to the arrangement of
the functions of all things, the company of Apas became the instruments,
the guardians, the directors of all things in all the Heavens and the
Planes; they became the overseers of the duties of all things in the
Moons, Suns, and Stars of each Heaven forming the twelve Heavens, each
one of which has its own Moon and Stars.<span
id="fr_25"></span>[25](#note_25)

   But the Sun is outside of everything. He is the *kai-pēhi* \[the
suppressor\] of all things beneath the sun; each of them have their
worlds, their moons and their stars.<span
id="fr_26"></span>[26](#note_26) The head \[rulers\] of all things,
Stars, Moons and Suns, are the Whatukuras of the Toi-o-nga-rangi-tuhaha
\[the Summit-of-the-conjoint-Heavens\], because the Apas are only
labourers of the Heavens, whilst the Pou-tiri-ao guard them lest they
deviate from their proper work, or quarrel.

### Footnotes

<span id="footnotes_page_161">p. 161</span>

<span id="note_1"></span>[1](#fr_1). *Angi* is the space between Heaven
and Earth, and also between Earth and Hades.

<span id="footnotes_page_162">p. 162</span>

<span id="note_2"></span>[2](#fr_2). See Chapter VI. as to this visit to
Hades.

<span id="note_3"></span>[3](#fr_3). This is explained by the Scribe as
follows, but it is not clear: If a child is born between the first and
seventh day after labour commences, it will be well for both mother and
child. But if not born between the seventh and twelfth day, the mother
and child will surely die.

<span id="footnotes_page_163">p. 163</span>

<span id="note_4"></span>[4](#fr_4). *Whetu-punga* are 'the smaller
stars sheltering under the Milky Way—those stars barely visible to the
eye. They are constantly falling off the Milky Way, and are then seen as
Meteors'—says the Scribe.

<span id="note_5"></span>[5](#fr_5). The Hakuai is said to be a very
large and fierce bird that is never seen but very high up in the
heavens. The stories connected with it seem to indicate that it is a
dimly remembered tradition of the Eagle, which the ancestors of the
Maoris knew in some former habitat. The Amokura is the Tropic bird,
which occasionally visits the North Cape of New Zealand, and the red
tail feathers of which were highly valued. The others are not
known—probably they were birds that dwelt in the original home of the
Maoris. Tawhaki's three birds are inhabitants of New Zealand, and their
tail feathers were much prized.

<span id="footnotes_page_164">p. 164</span>

<span id="note_6"></span>[6](#fr_6). The Pakura has a scarlet patch over
each eye, and the above is how the Maoris account for it—Matuku was
supposed to have done it.

<span id="footnotes_page_166">p. 166</span>

<span id="note_7"></span>[7](#fr_7). The Kete-rauroha means the 'basket
of wide space,' no doubt referring to the stars scattered over the
heavenly vault.

<span id="note_8"></span>[8](#fr_8). It will be noticed these stars are
twelve in number, as are the Heavens, and the months.

<span id="note_9"></span>[9](#fr_9). This is the first time I ever came
across a statement in Polynesian traditions that Venus ruled the year.
The Pleiades are universally said to do so. But, we may have here
possibly the faint recollection of another ancient cult, for J. F.
Hewitt in his "Primitive Traditional History," Vol. I., p. 132, says
that Alberune quotes Venus as having been worshipped at the beginning of
the Pleiades year.

<span id="note_10"></span>[10](#fr_10). The following illustration does
not belong to the "Celestial Plane," but to the period just before the
fleet left Tahiti for New Zealand in about A.D. 1350

<span id="note_11"></span>[11](#fr_11). Wehi-nui-a-maomao is said to
preside over one of the months—probably the twelfth. It is also said
that Titi-raupenga mountain in New Zealand was owned by this god, or

<span id="note_12"></span>[12](#fr_12). 'Te Waka-o-Tama-rere-ti'—the
canoe of Tama-rere-ti—is the constellation Scorpio. It is said that the
first canoe made by the Maori people in the Fatherland was copied from
this (hence the word 'pattern' in the text). The canoe's name is
'Uruao,' and sometimes the smaller stars fall overboard, and then appear
to us as *mata-kokiri*, or meteors.

<span id="note_13"></span>[13](#fr_13). The Ara-matua is the
'main-way'—the Ecliptic—or in other words the course of the heavenly
bodies in the Zodiac. The Kaupeka are the twelve months, equivalent to
the twelve signs of the Zodiac.

<span id="note_14"></span>[14](#fr_14). *Whakaatatia*. 'Men, gods, birds
and reptiles, all looked up to the Heavens, and were dissatisfied with
the arrangement'—says the Scribe.

<span id="note_15"></span>[15](#fr_15). The use of the word *pito*
(navel) throws a light on its meaning as connected with the Sun's path,
or Ecliptic, when considered in connection with the Hawaiian expression
Piko-o-wakea, which Hawaiian scholars translate as 'the Equator,' but
which we may now believe to be the Ecliptic of the Heavens rather than
the Terrestrial Equator. In the Hawaiian name, *piko* is the Maori
*pito* (for the Hawaiians have substituted the 'k' for the 't' in every
word of their language—a comparatively speaking modern innovation,
dating from about the commencement of the nineteenth century), and Wakea
is in Maori Watea, or Atea, and this latter word is equivalent to Rangi,
the Sky, in some of the Eastem Polynesian languages, meaning light, and
day, as does *rangi* in Maori. It is, therefore, apparent that *te pito
o Rangi* is the Celestial Equator, or more properly the Ecliptic, which
is also expressed by 'the Ara-matua,' or 'main way,' the part of the
Heavens in which the principal Stars, Sun, and Moon pursue their annual
courses.

<span id="note_16"></span>[16](#fr_16). It seems from this that the
Maori astronomy originated in the Southern Hemisphere. The "beginning of
the year" is the month of June—winter in the Southern Hemisphere.
Possibly the old priests had to change their nomenclature after they
left the Fatherland, which, there is little doubt, was north of the
Equator.

<span id="note_17"></span>[17](#fr_17). The Sage here says this is the
Leap Year of the White people, a remark probably added by the Scribe.

<span id="note_18"></span>[18](#fr_18). The Scribe endeavoured to
explain his ideas on this subject, but with not much success. Matohi, a
star, enters and disputes with the day called Tangaroa and, if
successful, no fish are caught, for the latter bring the fish. (Tangaroa
is a god of the ocean, fish, and all oceanic phenomena). Matohi is never
seen by man except during the days called Tangaroa (23rd to 25th of the
month); it is bluish in colour, and from his description of its position
in the Heavens it is probably near Alpha Taurus. It appears to me that
we have here an attempt to intercalate certain days to correct the Lunar
year.

<span id="note_19"></span>[19](#fr_19). A small, round-leafed sea-weed.

<span id="note_20"></span>[20](#fr_20). The home of the winds.

<span id="note_21"></span>[21](#fr_21). Pawa, short for Aitu-pawa, who
is one of the guardians of the Heavenly treasure house, and was ruler
over the Pou-tiri-ao, or guardian-spirts, whose function it was to
attend to the sequence of the months of the year.

<span id="note_22"></span>[22](#fr_22). In this the old Priest is a
little wrong, in as much as be includes the Stars in the change of
declination common to the Sun and Moon.

<span id="note_23"></span>[23](#fr_23). Rona is the woman in the moon,
about whom are several stories.

<span id="note_24"></span>[24](#fr_24). As, already explained, the above
'Ridge' is supposed to exist in the Pacific Ocean, between New Zealand
and Tahiti, where stormy weather and big waves are encountered—probably
the point in from lat. 23 to lat. 25, where the Trade winds meet the
prevailing westerly winds. The Scribe tells me that the tides are
supposed to flow up to each side of this 'Ridge,' and then recede, thus
making flood and ebb tide in opposite directions. The real belief of the
old Tohungas is difficult to get at; and it seems probable that the
Celestial Tuahiwi, or 'ridge' \[the Milky Way\] had something to do with
this change in the direction of the flow of the tides; or, what is just
as likely, the people in one of their former habitats, as in Indonesia,
had observed that the tides, at some well-known point, made in different
directions. This is a point that is worth looking up, but no work is
available here. The Scribe adds: Some Tohungas held that Matariki (the
Pleiades) ruled the tides, when that constellation is 'above' the
Tuahiwi, or 'Ridge' (? 'Celestial Ridge'), then it rules rather than the
Moon. Such was the teaching of Te-Waka-Kawatini—a well-known Tohunga—in
1876. The Pleiades are 'above' the 'Celestial Ridge' (Milky Way), of
course, soon after the former rises.

<span id="note_25"></span>[25](#fr_25). These last two words do not
follow the original exactly, but the Scribe tells me they correctly
describe the teaching of the Sages. When asked whether it was not the
same Sun, etc., that we see illuminates all the Heavens, he said, "No!
Each Heaven has it own Sun, Moon, and Stars."

<span id="note_26"></span>[26](#fr_26). This is obscure, but is just as
the Sage says.
