# XI.--THE HULA KI'I

I was not a little surprised when I learned that the ancient hula
repertory of the Hawaiians included a performance with marionettes,
*ki’i*, dressed up to represent human beings. But before accepting the
hula *ki’i* as a product indigenous to Hawaii, I asked myself, Might not
this be a performance in imitation of the Punch-and-Judy show familiar
to Europe and America?

After careful study of the question no evidence was found, other than
what might be inferred from general resemblance, for the theory of
adoption from a European or American origin. On the contrary, the words
used as an accompaniment to the play agree with report and tradition,
and bear convincing evidence in form and matter to a Hawaiian antiquity.
That is not to say, however, that in the use of marionettes the
Hawaiians did not hark back to their ancestral homes in the southern sea
or to a remoter past in Asia.

The six marionettes, *ki’i* (pls. [VIII](#img_pl08) and [IX](#img_pl09),
in the writer's possession were obtained from a distinguished kumu-hula,
who received them by inheritance, as it were, from his brother. "He gave
them to me," said he, "with these words, 'Take care of these things, and
when the time comes, after my death, that the king wants you to perform
before him, be ready to fulfill his desire.'"

It was in the reign of Kamehameha III that they came into the hands of
the elder brother, who was then and continued to be the royal
hula-master until his death. These ki’i have therefore figured in
performances that have been graced by the presence of King Kauikeaouli
(Kamehameha III) and his queen, Kalama, and by his successors since then
down to the times of Kalakaua. At the so-called "jubilee," the
anniversary of Kalakaua's fiftieth birthday, these marionettes were very
much in evidence.

The make-up and style of these ki’i are so similar that a description of
one will serve for all six. This marionette represents the figure of a
man, and was named *Maka-kú* ([pl. IX](#img_pl09)). The head is carved
out of some soft wood--either kukui or wiliwili--which is covered, as to
the hairy scalp, with a dark woven fabric much like broadcloth. It is
encircled at the level of the forehead with a broad band of gilt braid,
as if to ape the style of a soldier. The median line from the forehead
over the vertex to the back-head is crested with the *mahiole* ridge.
This, taken in connection with the encircling

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

gilt band, gives to the head a warlike appearance, somewhat as if it
were armed with the classical helmet, the Hawaiian name for which is
*mahi-ole*. The crest of the ridge and its points of junction with the
forehead and back-head are decorated with fillets of wool dyed of a
reddish color, in apparent imitation of the *mamo* or *o-ó*, the birds
whose feathers were used in decorating helmets, cloaks, and other
regalia. The features are carved with some attempt at fidelity. The eyes
are set with mother-of-pearl.

The figure is of about one-third life size, and was originally draped,
the author was told, in a loose robe, *holokú*, of tapa cloth of the
sort known as *mahuna*, which is quite thin. This piece of tapa is
perforated at short intervals with small holes, *kiko’i*. It is also
stained with the juice from the bark of the root of the kukui tree,
which imparts a color like that of copper, and makes the Hawaiians class
it as *pa’ikukui*. A portion of its former, its original, apparel has
been secured.

The image is now robed in a holokú of yellow cotton, beneath which is an
underskirt of striped silk in green and white. The arms are loosely
jointed to the body.

The performer in the hula, who stood behind a screen, by insinuating his
hands under the clothing of the marionette, could impart to it such
movements as were called for by the action of the play, while at the
same time he repeated the words of his part, words sup posed to be
uttered by the marionette.

The hula ki’i was, perhaps, the nearest approximation made by the
Hawaiians to a genuine dramatic performance. Its usual instrument of
musical accompaniment was the ipu, previously described. This drumlike
object was handled by that division of the performers called the
hoopa’a, who sat in full view of the audience manipulating the ipu in a
quiet, sentimental manner, similar to that employed in the hula kuolo.

As a sample of the stories illustrated in a performance of the hula ki’i
the following may be adduced, the dramatis personae of which are four:

1\. *Maka-kú*, a famous warrior, a rude, strong-handed braggart, as
boastful as Ajax.

2\. *Puapua-kea*, a small man, but brave and active.

3\. *Maile-lau-lii* (Small-leafed-maile), a young woman, who be comes
the wife of Maka-ku.

4\. *Maile-Pakaha*, the younger sister of Maile-lau-lii, who becomes the
wife of Puapua-kea.

Maka-kú, a rude and boastful son of Mars, at heart a bully, if not a
coward, is represented as ever aching for a fight, in which his
domineering spirit and rough-and-tumble ways for a time gave him the
advantage over abler, but more modest, adversaries.

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

 

<span id="img_pl09"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![PLATE IX&lt;br&gt;
MARIONETTE, MAKA-KÚ](tn/pl09.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/pl09.jpg)  
PLATE IX  
MARIONETTE, MAKA-KÚ  
</span>

 

Puapuakea, a man of genuine courage, hearing of the boastful
achievements of Maka-kú, seeks him out and challenges him.

At the first contest they fought with javelins, *ihe*, each one taking
his turn according to lot in casting his javelins to the full tale of
the prescribed number; after which the other contestant did the same.
Neither was victorious.

Next they fought with slings, each one having the right to sling forty
stones at the other. In this conflict also neither one of them got the
better of the other. The next trial was with stone-throwing. The result
was still the same.

Now it was for them to try the classical Hawaiian game of *lua*. This
was a strenuous form of contest that has many features in common with
the panathlion of the ancient Hellenes, some points in common with
boxing, and still more, perhaps, partakes of the character of the grand
art of combat, wrestling. Since becoming acquainted with the fine
Japanese art of *jiu-jitsu*, the author recognizes certain methods that
were shared by them both. But to all of these it added the wild
privileges of choking, bone-breaking, dislocating, eye-gouging, and the
infliction of tortures and grips unmentionable and disreputable. At
first the conflict was in suspense, victory favoring neither party; but
as the contest went on Puapuakea showed a slight superiority, and at the
finish he had bettered Maka-kú by three points, or *ai*, <span
id="fr_207"></span>[a](#fn_204) as the Hawaiians uniquely term it.

The sisters, Maile-lau-lii and Maile-pakaha, who had been interested
spectators of the contest, conceived passionate liking for the two
warriors and laid their plans in concert to capture them for themselves.
Fortunately their preferences were not in conflict. Maile-lau-lii set
her affections on Maka-kú, while the younger sister devoted herself to
Pua-pua-kea.

The two men had previously allowed their fancies to range abroad at
pleasure; but from this time they centered their hearts on these two
Mailes and settled down to regular married life.

Interest in the actual performance of the hula ki’i was stimulated by a
resort to byplay and buffoonery. One of the marionettes, for instance,
points to some one in the audience; whereupon one of the *hoopaa* asks,
"What do you want?" The marionette persists in its pointing. At length
the interlocutor, as if divining the marionette's wish, says: "Ah, you
want So-and-so." At this the marionette nods assent, and the hoopaa asks
again, "Do you wish him to come to you?" The marionette expresses its
delight and approval by nods and gestures, to the immense satisfaction
of the audience, who join in derisive laughter at the expense of the
person held up to ridicule.

Besides the marionettes already named among the characters found in the
different hula-plays of the hula ki’i, the author has heard

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

mention of the following marionettes: *Ku*, *Kini-ki’i*,
*Hoo-lehelehe-ki’i*, *Ki’i-ki’i*, and *Nihi-aumoe*.

Nihi-aumoe was a man without the incumbrance of a wife, an expert in the
arts of intrigue and seduction. Nihi-aumoe is a word of very suggestive
meaning, to walk softly at midnight. In Judge Andrews's dictionary are
found the following pertinent Hawaiian verses apropos of the word
*nihi*:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

E hoopono ka hele i ka uka o Puna;  
E *nihi* ka hele, mai hoolawehala,  
Mai noho a ako i ka pua, o hewa,  
O inaina ke Akua, paa ke alanui,  
Aole ou ala e hiki aku ai.

</div>

\[Translation\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Look to your ways in upland Puna;  
Walk softly, commit no offense;  
Daily not, nor pluck the flower sin;  
Lest God in anger bar the road,  
And you find no way of escape.

</div>

The marionette Ki’i-ki’i was a strenuous little fellow, an *ilamuku*, a
marshal, or constable of the king. It was his duty to carry out with
unrelenting rigor the commands of the alii, whether they bade him take
possession of a taro patch, set fire to a house, or to steal upon a man
at dead of night and dash out his brains while he slept.

Referring to the illustrations ([pl. VIII](#img_pl08)), a judge of human
nature can almost read the character of the libertine Nihi-aumoe written
in his features--the flattened vertex, indicative of lacking reverence
and fear, the ruffian strength of the broad face; and if one could
observe the reverse of the picture he would note the flattened
back-head, a feature that marks a large number of Hawaiian crania.

The songs that were cantillated to the hula ki’i express in some degree
the peculiar libertinism of this hula, which differed from all others by
many removes. They may be characterized as gossipy, sarcastic, ironical,
scandal-mongering, dealing in satire, abuse, hitting right and left at
social and personal vices--a cheese of rank flavor that is not to be
partaken of too freely. It might be compared to the vaudeville in opera
or to the genre picture in art.

The author has met with several variants to this mele, which do not
greatly change its character. In one of these variants the following
changes are to be noted:

Line 4. Pikaka <span id="fr_215"></span>[a](#fn_211) e ka luna, ke,
ke!  
Line 5. Ka luna o ka hale, Re, ke!  
Line 8. Ka puka o ka hale, a ke, ke!  
Line 9. E noho i anei, a ke, ke!

To attempt a translation of these lines which are unadulterated slang:

Line 4. The roof is a-dry, la, la!  
Line 5. The roof of the house, la, la!  
Line 8. The door of the house, la, la!  
Line 9. Turn in this way, la, la!

The one who supplied the above lines expressed inability to understand
their meaning, averring that they are "classical Hawaiian," meaning,
doubtless, that they are archaic slang. As to the ninth line, the
practice of "sitting in the door" seems to have been the fashion with
such folk as far back as the time of Solomon.

Let us picture this princess of Maui, this granddaughter of Wahieloa,
Wewehi, as a Helen, with all of Helen's frailty, a flirt-errant,
luxurious in life, quickly deserting one lover for the arms of another;
yet withal of such humanity and kindness of fascination that, at her
death, or absence, all things mourned her--not as Lycidas was mourned:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head.  
     \*              \*              \*              \*              \*  
And daffodillies fill their cups with tears,"</span>

</div>

but in some rude pagan fashion; all of which is wrought out and
symbolized in the mele with such imagery as is native to the mind of the
savage.

The attentive reader will not need be told that, as in many another
piece out of Hawaii's old-time legends, the path through this song is
beset with euphuistic stumbling blocks. The purpose of language, says
Talleyrand, is to conceal thought. The veil in this case is quite gauzy.

The language of the following song for the marionette dance, hula ki’i,
as in the one previously given, is mostly of that kind which the

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

Hawaiians term *olelo kapékepéke*, or *olelo huná*, shifty talk, or
secret talk. We might call it slang, though it is not slang in the exact
sense in which we use that word, applying it to the improvised counters
of thought that gain currency in our daily speech. until they find
admission to the forum, the platform, and the dictionary. It is rather
it cipher-speech, a method of concealing one's meaning from all but the
initiated, of which the Hawaiian, whether alii or commoner, was very
fond. The people of the hula were famous for this sort of accomplishment
and prided themselves not a little in it as an effectual means of giving
appropriate flavor and gusto to their performances.

</div>

The translation has to he based largely on conjecture. The author of
this bit of fun-making, which is couched in old-time slang, died without
making known the key to his cipher, and no one whom the present writer
has met with is able to unravel its full meaning.

The following mele for the hula ki’i, in language colored by the same
motive, was furnished by an accomplished practitioner who had traveled
far and wide in the practice of her art, having been one of a company of
hula dancers that attended the Columbian exposition in Chicago. It was
her good fortune also to reach the antipodes

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

in her travels, and it was at Berlin, she says, that she witnessed for
the first time the European counterpart of the hula ki’i, the "Punch and
Judy" show:

*Mele no ka Hula Ki’i*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

E le’e kau-kau, kala le’e;  
E le’e kau-kau.  
E le’e kau-kau, kala le’e.

E u-au ai aku;  
E u-au ai aku;

*Song for the Hula Ki’i*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now for the dance, dance in accord;  
Prepare for the dance.  
Now for the dance, dance in time.  
Up, now, with the flag!

Ha, ha, ha!

</div>

This translation is the result of much research, yet its absolute
accuracy can not be vouched for. The most learned authorities
(*kaka-olelo*) in old Hawaiian lore that have been found by the writer
express themselves as greatly puzzled at the exact meaning of the mele
just given. Some scholars, no doubt, would dub these nonsense-lines. The
author can not consent to any such view. The old Hawaiians were too much
in earnest to permit themselves to juggle with words in such fashion.
They were fond of mystery and concealment, appreciated a joke, given to
slang, but to string a lot of words together without meaning, after the
fashion of a college student who delights to relieve his mind by
shouting "Upidee, upida," was not their way. "The people of the hula,"
said one man, "had ways of fun-making peculiar to themselves."

When the hula-dancer who communicated to the author the above song--a
very accomplished and intelligent woman--was asked for information that
would render possible its proper translation, she replied that her part
was only that of a mouthpiece to repeat the words and to make
appropriate gestures, *he pono hula wale no*, mere parrot-work. The
language, she said, was such "classic" Hawaiian as to be beyond her
understanding.

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

Here, again, is another song in argot, a coin of the same mintage as
those just given:

*Mele*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

E kau-kau i hale manu, e!  
Ike oe i ka lolo huluhulu, e?  
I ka huluhulu a we’uwe’u, e?

5 Walea ka manu i ka wai, e!  
I ka wai lohi o ke kini, e!

</div>

\[Translation\]

*Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Let's worship now the bird-cage.  
Seest thou the furzy woodland,  
The shag of herb and forest.  
The low earth-tinting rainbow.  
5 Child of the Sun that swings above?  
O, happy bird, to drink from the pool,  
A bliss free to the million!

</div>

This is the language of symbolism. When Venus went about to ensnare
Adonis, among her other wiles she warbled to him of mountains, dales,
and pleasant fountains.

The mele now presented is of an entirely different character from those
that have just preceded. It is said to have been the joint composition
of the high chief Keiki-o-ewa of Kauai, at one time the kahu of Prince
Moses, and of Kapihe, a distinguished poet--haku-mele--and prophet. (To
Kapihe is ascribed the prophetic and oracular utterance, *E iho ana o
luna, e pii ana o lalo; e ku ana ka paia, e moe ana kaula; e kau ana
kau-huhu--o lani iluna, o honua ilalo*--"The high shall be brought low,
the lowly uplifted; the defenses shall stand; the prophet shall lie low;
the mountain walls shall abide--heaven above, earth beneath.")

This next poem may be regarded as an epithalamium, the celebration of
the mystery and bliss of the wedding night, the *hoáo ana* of a high
chief and his high-born *kapu* sister. The murmur of the breeze, the
fury of the winds, the heat of the sun, the sacrificial ovens, all are
symbols that set forth the emotions, experiences, and mysteries of the
night:

Wanahili bides the whole night with Manu’a,

Great Kiha, offspring of Pii-lani,

The far-roaming eye now sparkles with joy,  
Whose energy erstwhile shook mountains,  
The king who firm-bound the isles in one state,

Hawaii the eld of Keawe,  
Whose tabu, burning with blood-red blaze,  
Shoots flame-tongues that leap with the wind,

15 Waihoa humps its back, while cold Mikioi  
Blows fierce and swift across Hala-li’i.  
It vaunts like a king at Kekaha,  
Flaunting itself in the sun's heat,  
And lifts itself up in mirage,  
20 Ghost-forms of woods and trees in Kekaha--  
Sweeping o’er waste Kala-ihi, Water-of-Lono;  
While the sun shoots forth its fierce rays--

Makua, whose arms embrace Kalalau.

</div>

The mind of the ancient bard was so narrowly centered on the small plot
his imagination cultivated that he disregarded the outside world,
forgetting that it could not gaze upon the scenes which filled his eyes.

The valley of Kalalau from its deep recess in the northwestern coast of
Kauai looks out upon the heaving waters of the Pacific. The mountain
walls of the valley are abrupt, often overhanging. Viewed from the
ocean, the cliffs are piled one upon another like the buttresses of a
Gothic cathedral. The ocean is often stormy, and during several months
in the year forbids intercourse with other parts of the island, save as
the hardy traveler makes his way along precipitous mountain trails.

The hula *ala’a-papa*, hula *ipu*, hula *pa-ipu* (or *kuolo*), the hula
*hoo-naná*, and the *hula ki’i* were all performed to the accompaniment
of the ipu or calabash, and, being the only ones that were so
accompanied, if the author is correctly informed, they may be classed
together under one head as the calabash hulas.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_204"></span>[93:a](ulh15.htm#fr_207) *Ai*, literally a
food, a course.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[94:a](ulh15.htm#fr_208) *Punana*. Literally a
nest; here a raised couch on the pola, which was a sheltered platform in
the waist of a double canoe, corresponding to our cabin, for the use of
chiefs and other people of distinction.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[94:b](ulh15.htm#fr_209) *Kai-oa*. The
paddle-men; here a euphemism.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[95:a](ulh15.htm#fr_210) *Wa’a*. A euphemism
for the human body.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[95:b](ulh15.htm#fr_211) *Mawi*. The hero of
Polynesian mythology, whose name is usually spelled *Maui*, like the
name of the island. Departure from the usual orthography is made in
order to secure phonetic accuracy. The name of the hero is pronounced
*Máh-wee*, not *Mów-ee*, as is the island. Sir George Gray, of New
Zealand, following the usual orthography, has given a very full and
interesting account of him in his Polynesian mythology.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[95:c](ulh15.htm#fr_213) *Wewehi-loa*. Another
name for *Wahie-loa*, who is said to have been the grandfather of
Wewehi. The word *luau’i* in the previous verse, meaning real father, is
an archaic form. Another form is *kua-u’i*.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[95:d](ulh15.htm#fr_214) *Puka kahiko*. A
strange story from Hawaiian mythology relates that originally the human
anatomy was sadly deficient in that the terminal gate of the *prima viæ*
was closed. Mawi applied his common-sense surgery to the repair of the
defect and relieved the situation. *Ua olelo ia i kinohi na hana ia
kanaka me ka hemahema no ka nele i ka hou puka ole ia ka okole, a na
Mawi i hoopau i keia pilikia mamuli o kana hana akamai. Ua kapa ia keia
puka ka puka kahiko*.

<span id="fn_211"></span>[96:a](ulh15.htm#fr_215) *Pikaka* (full form
*pikakao*). Dried up, juiceless.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[97:a](ulh15.htm#fr_216) *Kau-kau*. Conjectural
meaning to point out some one in the audience, as the marionettes often
did. People were thus sometimes inveigled in behind the curtain.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[97:b](ulh15.htm#fr_217) *Hala-le*. Said to
mean a sop, with which one took tip the juice or gravy of food; a choice
morsel.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[97:c](ulh15.htm#fr_218) *Ku-pou*. To stoop
over, from devotion to one's own pursuits, from modesty, or from shame.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[97:d](ulh15.htm#fr_219) The meaning of this
line has been matter for much conjecture. The author has finally adopted
the suggestion embodied in the translation here given, which is a
somewhat gross reference to the woman's physical charms.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[99:a](ulh15.htm#fr_220) *Punohu*. A compact
mass of clouds, generally lying low in the heavens; a cloud-omen; also a
rainbow that lies close to the earth, such as is formed when the sun is
high in the heavens.

<span id="fn_217"></span>[100:a](ulh15.htm#fr_221) *Wanahili*. A
princess of the mythological period belonging to Puna, Hawaii.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[100:b](ulh15.htm#fr_222) *Manu’a*. A king of
Hilo, the son of Kane-hili, famous for his skill in spear-throwing,
*maika*-rolling, and all athletic exercises. He was united in marriage,
*ho-ao*, to the lovely princess Wanahili. Tradition deals with Manua as
a very lovable character.

<span id="fn_219"></span>[100:c](ulh15.htm#fr_223) *Pu kau kama*. The
conch (pu) is figured as the herald of fame. *Kau* is used in the sense
of to set on high, in contrast with such a word as *waiho*, to set down.
*Kama* is the word of dignity for children.

<span id="fn_220"></span>[100:d](ulh15.htm#fr_224) *Pu leina*. It is
asserted on good authority that the triton (*pu*), when approached in
its ocean habitat, will often make sudden and extraordinary leaps in an
effort to escape. There is special reference here to the famous conch
known in Hawaiian story as *Kiha-pu*. It was credited with supernatural
powers as a *kupua*. During the reign of Umi, son of Liloa, it was
stolen from the *heiau* in Waipio valley and came into the hands of god
Kane. In his wild awa-drinking revels the god terrified Umi and his
people by sounding nightly blasts with the conch. The shell was finally
restored to King Umi by the superhuman aid of the famous dog
Puapua-lena-lena.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[100:e](ulh15.htm#fr_225) *Kiha-nui a Piilani*.
Son of Piilani, a king of Maui. He is credited with the formidable
engineering work of making a paved road over the mountain palis of
Koolau, Maui.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[100:f](ulh15.htm#fr_226) *Kauhi
kalana-honu’-a-Kama*. This Kauhi, as his long title indicates, was the
son of the famous king, Kama-lala-walu, and succeeded his father in the
kingship over Maui and, probably, Lanai. Kama-lala-walu had a long and
prosperous reign, which ended, however, in disaster. Acting on the
erroneous reports of his son Kauhi, whom he had sent to spy out the
land, he invaded the kingdom of Lono-i-ka-makahiki on Hawaii, was
wounded and defeated in battle, taken prisoner, and offered up as a
sacrifice on the altar of Lono's god, preferring that death, it is said,
to the ignominy of release.

<span id="fn_223"></span>[100:g](ulh15.htm#fr_227) *I-olena*. Roving,
shifty, lustful.

<span id="fn_224"></span>[100:h](ulh15.htm#fr_228) *Kanaka hoali mauna*.
Man who moved mountains; an epithet of compliment applied perhaps to
Kiha, above mentioned, or to the king mentioned in the next verse.
Kekaulike.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[100:i](ulh15.htm#fr_229) *Ku’i hono i ka
moku*. Who bound together into one (state) the islands Maui, Molokai,
Lanai, and Kahoolawe. This was, it is said, Kekaulike, the fifth king of
Maui after Kamalala-wale. At his death he was succeeded by
Kamehameha-nui--to he distinguished from the Kamehameha of Hawaii and he
in turn by the famous warrior-king Kahekili, who routed the invading
array of Kalaniopuu, king of Hawaii, on the sand plains of Wailuku.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[100:j](ulh15.htm#fr_230) *I waihona kapuahi
kanaka ehá*. This verse presents grammatical difficulties. The word *I*
implies the imperative, a form of request or demand, though that is
probably not the intent. It seems to be a means, authorized by poetical
license, of ascribing honor and tabu-glory to the name of the person
eulogized, who, the context leads the author to think, was Kekaulike.
The island names other than that of Maui seem to have been thrown in for
poetical effect, as that king, in the opinion of the author, had no
power over Kauai, Oahu, or Hawaii. The purpose may have been to assert
that his glory reached to those islands.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[100:k](ulh15.htm#fr_231) *Keawe enaena*.
Keawe, whose tabu was hot as a burning oven. Presumably Keawe, the son
of Umi, is the one meant.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[100:l](ulh15.htm#fr_232) *Naulu*. The
sea-breeze at Waimea, Kauai.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[101:a](ulh15.htm#fr_233) *Hale-lii*. A sandy
plain on Niihau, where grows a variety of sugar-cane that lies largely
covered by the loose soil, *ke ko eli o Hala-lii*.

<span id="fn_230"></span>[101:b](ulh15.htm#fr_234) *Li’u-la*. The
mirage, a common phenomenon on Niihau, and especially at Mana, on Kauai.

<span id="fn_231"></span>[101:c](ulh15.htm#fr_235) *Lawa-kua*. A wind in
Kalalau that blows for a time from the mountains and then, it is said,
veers to the north, so that it comes from the direction of a secondary
valley, Kolo-kini, a branch of Kalalau. The bard describes it as
continuing to blow for twelve nights before it shifts, an instance,
probably, of poetic license.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[102:a](ulh15.htm#fr_236) *Ko’a-mano*. A part
of the ocean into which the stream Wai-aloha falls.

<span id="fn_233"></span>[102:b](ulh15.htm#fr_237) *Waha iho*. With
mouth that yawns downward, referring, doubtless. to the overarching of
the *pali*, precipice. The same figure is applied to the back (*kua*) of
the traveler who climbs it.

<span id="fn_234"></span>[102:c](ulh15.htm#fr_238) Elision of the final
*a* in *ana*.
