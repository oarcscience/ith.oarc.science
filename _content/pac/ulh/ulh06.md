# II.--THE HALAU; THE KUAHU--THEIR DECORATION AND CONSECRATION

### THE HALAU

In building a halau, or hall, in which to perform the hula a Hawaiian of
the old, old time was making a temple for his god. In later and
degenerate ages almost any structure would serve the purpose; it might
be a flimsy shed or an extemporaneous *lanai* such as is used to shelter
that *al fresco* entertainment, the *luau*. But in the old times of
strict tabu and rigorous etiquette, when the chief had but to lift his
hand and the entire population of a district ransacked plain, valley,
and mountain to collect the poles, beams, thatch, and cord stuff; when
the workers were so numerous that the structure grew and took shape in a
day, we may well believe that ambitious and punctilious patrons of the
hula, such as La’a, Liloa, or Lono-i-ka-makahiki, did not allow the
divine art of Laka to house in a barn.

The choice of a site was a matter of prime importance. A formidable code
enunciated the principles governing the selection. But a matter of great
solicitude--there were omens to be heeded, snares and pitfalls devised
by the superstitious mind for its own entanglement. The untimely sneeze,
the ophthalmic eye, the hunched back were omens to be shunned.

Within historic times, since the abrogation of the tabu system and the
loosening of the old polytheistic ideas, there has been in the hula a
lowering of former standards, in some respects a degeneration. The old
gods, however, were not entirely dethroned; the people of the hula still
continued to maintain the form of divine service and still appealed to
them for good luck; but the soul of worship had exhaled, the main study
now was to make of the hula a pecuniary success.

In an important sense the old way was in sympathy with the thought,
"Except God be with the workmen, they labor in vain that build the
house." The means for gaining divine favor and averting the frown of the
gods were those practised by all religionists in the infantile state of
the human mind-the observance of fasts and tabus, the offering of
special prayers and sacrifices. The ceremonial purification of the site,
or of the building if it had been used for profane purposes, was
accomplished by aspersions with sea water mixed with turmeric or red
earth.

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

When one considers the tenacious hold which all rites and ceremonies
growing out of what we are accustomed to call superstitions had on the
mind of the primitive Hawaiian, it puzzles one to account for the entire
dropping out from modern memory of the prayers which were recited during
the erection of a hall for the shelter of an institution so festive and
so popular as the hula, while the prayers and gloomy ritual of the
temple service have survived. The explanation may be found, perhaps, in
the fact that the priests of the temple held position by the sovereign's
appointment; they formed a hierarchy by themselves, whereas the position
of the *kumu-hula*, who was also a priest, was open to anyone who fitted
himself for it by training and study and bypassing successfully the
*ai-lolo* <span id="fr_1"></span>[a](#fn_1) ordeal. After that he had
the right to approach the altar of the hula god with the prescribed
offerings and to present the prayers and petitions of the company to
Laka or Kapo.

In pleasing contrast to the worship of the *heiau*, the service of the
hula was not marred by the presence of groaning victims and bloody
sacrifices. Instead we find the offerings to have been mostly rustic
tokens, things entirely consistent with light-heartedness, joy, and
ecstasy of devotion, as if to celebrate the fact that heaven had come
down to earth and Pan, with all the nymphs, was dancing.

During the time the halau was building the tabus and rules that
regulated conduct were enforced with the utmost strictness. The members
of the company were required to maintain the greatest propriety of
demeanor, to suppress all rudeness of speech and manner, to abstain from
all carnal indulgence, to deny themselves specified articles of food,
and above all to avoid contact with a corpse. If anyone, even by
accident, suffered such defilement, before being received again into
fellowship or permitted to enter the halau and take part in the
exercises he must have ceremonial cleansing (*huikala*). The *kumu*
offered up prayers, sprinkled the offender with salt water and turmeric,
commanded him to bathe in the ocean, and he was clean. If the breach of
discipline was gross and willful, an act of outrageous violence or the
neglect of tabu, the offender could be restored only after penitence and
confession.

### THE KUAHU

In every halau stood the *kuahu*, or altar, as the visible temporary
abode of the deity, whose presence was at once the inspiration of the
performance and the luck-bringer of the enterprise--a rustic frame
embowered in greenery. The gathering of the green leaves and other sweet
finery of nature for its construction and decoration was a matter of so
great importance that it could not be intrusted to any chance

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

assemblage of wild youth who might see fit to take the work in hand.
There were formalities that must be observed, songs to be chanted,
prayers to be recited. It was necessary to bear in mind that when one
deflowered the woods of their fronds of *íe-íe* and fern or tore the
trailing lengths of *maile*--albeit in honor of Laka herself--the body
of the goddess was being despoiled, and the despoiling must be done with
all tactful grace and etiquette.

It must not be gathered from this that the occasion was made solemn and
oppressive with weight of ceremony, as when a temple was erected or as
when a tabu chief walked abroad, and all men lay with their mouths in
the dust. On the contrary, it was a time of joy and decorous exultation,
a time when in prayer-songs and ascriptions of praise the poet ransacked
all nature for figures and allusions to be used in caressing the deity.

The following adulatory prayer (*kánaenáe*) in adoration of Laka was
recited while gathering the woodland decorations for the altar. It is
worthy of preservation for its intrinsic beauty, for the spirit of
trustfulness it breathes. We remark the petitions it utters for the
growth of tree and shrub, as if Laka had been the alma mater under whose
influence all nature budded and rejoiced.

It would seem as if the physical ecstasy of the dance and the sensuous
joy of all nature's finery had breathed their spirit into the aspiration
and that the beauty of leaf and flower, all of them familiar forms of
the god's metamorphosis--accessible to their touch and for the
regalement of their senses--had brought such nearness and dearness of
affection between goddess and worshiper that all fear was removed.

A Prayer of Adulation to Laka  
In the forests, on the ridges  
Of the mountains stands Laka;  
Dwelling In the source of the mists.  
Laka, mistress of the hula,  
5 Has climbed the wooded haunts of the gods,  
Altars hallowed by the sacrificial swine,  
The head of the boar, the black boar of Kane.  
A partner he with Laka;  
Woman, she by strife gained rank in heaven.  
10 That the root may grow from the stem,  
That the young shoot may put forth and leaf,  
Pushing up the fresh enfolded bud,  
The scion-thrust bud and fruit toward the East,  
Like the tree that bewitches the winter fish,  
15 Maka-lei, tree famed from the age of night.  
Truth is the counsel of night--  
May it fruit and ripen above.  
A messenger I bring you, O Laka,  
To the girding of paú.  
20 An opening festa this for thee and me;  
To show the might of the god,  
The power of the goddess,  
Of Laka, the sister,  
To Lono a wife in the heavenly courts.  
25 O Lono, join heaven and earth!  
Thine alone are the pillars of Kahiki.  
Warm greeting, beloved one,  
We hail thee!

</div>

The cult of god Lono was milder, more humane, than that of Kane and the
other major gods. No human sacrifices were offered on his altars. The
statement in verse 26 accords with the general belief of the Hawaiians
that Lono dwelt in foreign parts, *Kukulu o Kahiki*, and that he would
some time come to them from across the waters. When Captain Cook arrived
in his ships, the Hawaiians worshiped him as the god Lono.

The following song-prayer also is one that was used at the gathering of
the greenery in the mountains and during the building of the altar in
the halau. When recited in the halau all the pupils took part, and the
chorus was a response in which the whole assembly in the halau were
expected to join:

*Pule Kuahu no Laka*

*Altar-Prayer to Laka*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

This spoil and rape of the wildwood,  
This plucking of wilderness maile--  
Collect of garlands, Laka, for you.  
Hiiaka, the prophet, heals our diseases.  
5 Enter, possess, inspire your altar;  
Heed our prayer, ’tis for life;  
Our petition to you is for life.  
  *Chorus*:  
Give us life, save from transgression!

</div>

The wildwoods of Hawaii furnished in great abundance and variety small
poles for the framework of the kuahu, the altar, the holy place of the
halau, and sweet-scented leaves and flowers suitable for its decoration.
A spirit of fitness, however, limited choice among these to certain
species that were deemed acceptable to the goddess because they were
reckoned as among her favorite forms of metamorphosis. To go outside
this ordained and traditional range would have been an offense, a
sacrilege. This critical spirit would have looked with the greatest
disfavor on the practice that in modern times has crept in, of bedecking
the dancers with garlands of roses, pinks, jessamine, and other
nonindigenous flowers, as being utterly repugnant to the traditional
spirit of the hula.

Among decorations approved and most highly esteemed stood preeminent the
fragrant maile ([pl. IV](ulh09.htm#img_pl04)) and the star-like fronds
and ruddy drupe of the *íe-íe* ([pl. II](#img_pl02)) and its kindred,
the *hála-pépe* ([pl. III](ulh07.htm#img_pl03)); the scarlet pompons of
the *lehúa* ([pl. XIII](ulh22.htm#img_pl13)) and *ohi’a*, with the fruit
of the latter (the mountain-apple); many varieties of fern, including
that splendid parasite, the "bird's nest fern" (*ekáha*), hailed by

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

the Hawaiians as Mawi's paddle; to which must be added the commoner
leaves and lemon-colored flowers of the native hibiscus, the *hau*, the
breadfruit, the native banana and the dracæna (*ti*), [plate
V](ulh11.htm#img_pl05); and lastly, richest of all, in the color that
became Hawaii's favorite, the royal yellow *ilíma* ([pl.
VI](ulh12.htm#img_pl06)), a flower familiar to the eves of the tourist
to Honolulu.

While deft hands are building and weaving the light framework of the
kuahu, binding its parts with strong vines and decorating it with
nature's sumptuous embroidery, the *kumu*, or teacher, under the
inspiration of the deity for whose residence he has prepared himself by
long vigil and fasting with fleshly abstinence, having spent the
previous night alone in the halau, is chanting or cantillating his
adulatory prayers, *kanaenae*--songs of praise they seem to be--to the
glorification of the gods and goddesses who are invited to bless the
occasion with their presence and inspiration, but especially of that
one, Laka, whose bodily presence is symbolized by a rude block of wood
arrayed in yellow tapa that is set up on the altar itself. Thus does the
kumu sing:

*Pule Kuahu*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Ei’ au, e Laka mai uka,  
E Laka mai kai;  
O hooulu  
O ka ilio <span id="fr_18"></span>[a](#fn_17) nana e hae,

E ho’i, ho’i mai a noho i kou kuahu!

</div>

\[Translation\]

*Altar Prayer* (to Laka)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Here am I, oh Laka from the mountains,  
Oh Laka from the shore;  
Protect us  
Against the dog that barks:

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

5 Reside in the wild-twining maile  
And the goddess-enwreathing ti.  
All, the joyful pulses  
Of the woman Ha’i-ka-manawa!  
Thou art Laka,  
10 The god of this altar;  
Return, return, abide in thy shrine!

</div>

The prayers which the hula folk of old times chanted while gathering the
material in the woods or while weaving it into shape in the halau for
the construction of a shrine did not form a rigid liturgy; they formed
rather a repertory as elastic as the sighing of the breeze, or the songs
of the birds whose notes embroidered the pure mountain air. There were
many altar-prayers, so that if a prayer came to an end before the work
was done the priest had but to begin the recitation of another prayer,
or, if the spirit of the occasion so moved him, he would take up again a
prayer already repeated, for until the work was entirely accomplished
the voice of prayer must continue to be heard.

The *pule* now to be given seems to be specially suited to that portion
of the service which took place in the woods at the gathering of the
poles and greenery. It was designed specially for the placating of the
little god-folk who front their number were addressed as *Kini o ke
Akua*, the multitude of the little gods, and who were the counterparts
in old Hawaii of our brownies, elfins, sprites, kobolds, gnomes, and
other woodland imps. These creatures, though dwarfish and insignificant
in person, were in such numbers--four thousand, forty thousand, four
hundred thousand--and were so impatient of any invasion of their
territory, so jealous of their prerogatives, so spiteful and revengeful
when injured, that it was policy always to keep on the right side of
them.

*Pule Kuahu*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

E hooulu ana i Kini <span id="fr_21"></span>[a](#fn_20) o ke Akua,

*Altar-Prayer*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Invoke we now the four thousand,  
The myriads four of the nimble,  
The four hundred thousand elves,

Pray, Kane, also inspire us;  
Kanaloa, too, join the assembly.  
Now grows the *ohi’a*, now leafs *ie-ie*;  
God enters, resides in the place;  
10 He mounts, inspires, abides in the shrine.  
This Is our prayer, our plea this for life!  
  *Chorus*:  
Life shall be thine!

</div>

From one point of view these *pule* are not to be regarded as prayers in
the ordinary sense of the word, but rather as song-offerings, verbal
bouquets, affectionate sacrifices to the gods.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[16:a](ulh06.htm#fr_2) *Wao-kéle*. That portion
of the mountain forest where grew the monarch trees was called
*wao-kele* or *wao-maukele*.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[16:b](ulh06.htm#fr_3) *Na Kane*. Why was the
offering, the black roast porkling, said to be for Kane, who was not a
special patron, *au-makúa*, of the hula? The only answer the author has
been able to obtain from any Hawaiian is that, though Kane was not a god
of the hula, he was a near relative. On reflection, the author can see a
propriety in devoting the reeking flesh of the swine to god Kane, while
to the sylvan deity, Laka, goddess of the peaceful hula, were devoted
the rustic offerings that were the embodiment of her charms. Her Image,
or token--an uncarved block of wood--was set up in a prominent part of
the *kuahu*, and at the close of a performance the wreaths that had been
worn by the actors were draped about the image. Thus viewed, there is a
delicate propriety and significance In such disposal of the pig.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[17:a](ulh06.htm#fr_4) *Maka-li’i* (Small eyes).
The Pleiades; also the period of six months, including the rainy season,
that began some time in October or November and was reckoned from the
date when the Pleiades appeared in the East at sunset. *Maka-li’i* was
also the name of a month, by some reckoned as the first month of the
year.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[17:b](ulh06.htm#fr_5) *Maka-léi*. The name of a
famous mythological tree which had the power of attracting fish. It did
not poison, but only bewitched or fascinated them. There were two trees
bearing this name, one a male, the other a female, which both grew at a
place in Hilo called Pali-uli. One of these, the female, was, according
to tradition, carried from its root home to the fish ponds in Kailua,
Oahu, for the purpose of attracting fish to the neighboring waters. The
enterprise was eminently successful.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[17:c](ulh06.htm#fr_6) *Po*. Literally night; the
period in cosmogony when darkness and chaos reigned, before the affairs
on earth had become settled under the rule of the gods. Here the word is
used to indicate a period of remote mythologic antiquity. The use of the
word *Po* in the following verse reminds one of the French adage, "La
nuit porte conseil."

<span id="fn_7"></span>[17:d](ulh06.htm#fr_7) *Kokúa*. Another form for
*kakúa*, to gird on, the *pa-ú*. (See *Pa-ú* song, pp.
[51](ulh12.htm#page_51)-53.)

<span id="fn_8"></span>[17:e](ulh06.htm#fr_8) *Uníki*, A word not given
in the dictionary. The debut of an actor at the hula, after passing the
*ai-lolo* test and graduating from the school of the halau, a critical
event.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[17:f](ulh06.htm#fr_9) *Ha-íke-íke*. Equivalent
to *ho-íke-íke*, an exhibition, to exhibit.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[17:g](ulh06.htm#fr_10) *Ou-alii*. The Hawaiians
seem to have lost the meaning of this word. The author has been at some
pains to work it out somewhat conjecturally.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[17:h](ulh06.htm#fr_11) *E Lono, e hu’ ia mai,
etc*. The unelided form of the word *hu’* would be *hui*. The final *i*
is dropped before the similar vowel of *ia*.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[17:i](ulh06.htm#fr_12) *Kukúlu o Kahíki*. The
pillars of Kahiki. The ancient Hawaiians supposed the starry heavens to
be a solid dome supported by a wall or vertical
construction--*kukulu*--set up along the horizon. That section of the
wall that stood over against Kahiki they termed *Kukulu o Kahiki*. Our
geographical name Tahiti is of course from Kahiki, though it does not
apply to the same region. After the close of what has been termed "the
period of intercourse," which came probably during the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, and during which the ancient Hawaiians voyaged to
and fro between Hawaii and the lands of the South, geographical ideas
became hazy and the term *Kahiki* came to be applied to any foreign
country.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[17:j](ulh06.htm#fr_13) *Áno-ái*. An old form of
salutation, answering In general to the more modern word *aloha*, much
used at the present time. *Ano-ai* seems to have had a shade of meaning
more nearly answering to our word "welcome." This is the first instance
the author has met with of its use in poetry.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[19:a](ulh06.htm#fr_14) *Hoo-ulu*. This word has
a considerable range of meaning, well illustrated in this mele. In its
simplest form, *ulu*, it means to grow, to become strong. Joined with
the causative *hoo*, as here, it takes on the spiritual meaning of
causing to prosper, of inspiring. The word "collect," used in the
translation, has been chosen to express the double sense of gathering
the garlands and of devoting them to the goddess as a religious
offering. In the fourth verse this word, hooulu, is used in the sense of
to heal. Compare note  <span id="fr_17"></span>[c](#fn_16).

<span id="fn_15"></span>[19:b](ulh06.htm#fr_15) *Hiiaka*. The youngest
sister of Pele, often spoken of as *Hiiaka-i-ka-poli-o-Pele*,
Hiiaka-of-the-bosom-of-Pele. Why she should be spoken of as capable of
healing diseases is not at all clear.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[19:c](ulh06.htm#fr_17) *Ulu*. Here we have the
word ulu in its simple, uncombined form, meaning to enter into and
inspire.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[20:a](ulh06.htm#fr_18) *Ilio nana e hae*. The
barking of a dog, the crowing of a cock, the grunting of a pig, the
hooting of an owl, or any such sound occurring at the time of a
religious solemnity, *aha*, broke the spell of the incantation and
vitiated the ceremony. Such an untimely accident was as much deprecated
as were the Turk, the Comet, and the Devil by pious Christian souls
during the Middle Ages.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[20:b](ulh06.htm#fr_19) *Lau-ki*. The leaf of
the *ti* plant--the same as the *ki*--(Dracæna terminalis), much used as
an emblem of divine power, a charm or defense against malign spiritual
Influences. The kahuna often wore about his neck a fillet of this leaf.
The *ti* leaf was a special emblem of Ha’i-wahine, or of Li’a-wahine. It
was much used as a decoration about the halau.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[20:c](ulh06.htm#fr_20) *Ha’i-ka-manawa*. It is
conjectured that this is the same as *Ha’i-wahine*. She was a
mythological character, about whom there is a long and tragic story.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[21:a](ulh06.htm#fr_21) *Kini o ke Akua*. See
note *d*, [p. 24](ulh07.htm#page_24).
