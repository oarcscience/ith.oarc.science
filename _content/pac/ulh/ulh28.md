# XXIV.--THE HULA PELE

The Hawaiian drama could lay hold of no worthier theme than that offered
by the story of Pele. In this epic we find the natural and the
supernatural, the everyday events of nature and the sublime phenomena of
nature's wonderland, so interwoven as to make a story rich in strong
human and deific coloring. It is true that the genius of the Hawaiian
was not equal to the task of assembling the dissevered parts and of
combining into artistic unity the materials his own imagination had
spun. This very fact, however, brings us so much nearer to the inner
workshop of the Hawaiian mind.

The story of Pele is so long and complicated that only a brief abstract
of it can be offered now:

Pele, the goddess of the volcano, in her dreams and wanderings in
spirit-form, met and loved the handsome Prince Lohiau. She would not be
satisfied with mere spiritual intercourse; she demanded the sacrament of
bodily presence. Who should be the embassador to bring the youth from
his distant home on Kauai? She begged her grown-up sisters to attempt
the task. They foresaw the peril and declined the thankless undertaking.
Hiiaka, the youngest and most. affectionate, accepted the mission; but,
knowing her sister's evil temper, strove. to obtain from Pele a guaranty
that her own forests and the life of her bosom friend Hopoe should be
safeguarded during her absence.

Hiiaka was accompanied by Wahine-oma’o--the woman in green--a woman as
beautiful as herself. After many adventures they arrived at Haena and
found Lohiau dead and in his sepulchre, a sacrifice to the jealousy of
Pele. They entered the cave, and after ten days of prayer and
incantation Hiiaka had the satisfaction of seeing the body of Lohiau
warmed and animated by the reentrance of the spirit; and the company,
now of three, soon started on the return to Kilauea.

The time consumed by Hiiaka in her going and doing and returning had
been so long that Pele was moved to unreasonable jealousy and,
regardless of her promise to her faithful sister, she devastated with
fire the forest parks of Hiiaka and sacrificed the life of Hiiaka's
bosom friend, the innocent and beautiful Hopoe.

Hiiaka and Lohiau, on their arrival at Kilauea, seated themselves on its
ferny brink, and there, in the open view of Pele's court, Hiiaka, in
resentment at the broken faith of her sister and in defiance of her
power, invited and received from Lohiau the kisses and dalliance

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

which up to that time she had repelled. Pele, in a frenzy of passion,
overwhelmed her errant lover, Lohiau, with fire, turned his body into a
pillar of rock, and convulsed earth and sea. Only through the
intervention of the benevolent peacemaking god Kane was the order of the
world saved from utter ruin.

The ancient Hawaiians naturally regarded the Pele hula with special
reverence by reason of its mythological importance, and they selected it
for performance on occasions of gravity as a means of honoring the kings
and alii of the land. They would have considered its presentation on
common occasions, or in a spirit of levity, as a great impropriety.

In ancient times the performance of the hula Pele, like that of all
other plays, was prefaced with prayer and sacrifice. The offering
customarily used in the service of this hula consisted of salt crystals
and of luau made from the delicate unrolled taro leaf. This was the gift
demanded of every pupil seeking admission to the school of the hula,
being looked upon as an offering specially acceptable to Pele, the
patron of this hula. In the performance of the sacrifice teacher and
pupil approached and stood reverently before the kuahu while the former
recited a mele, which was a prayer to the goddess. The pupil ate the
luau, the teacher placed the package of salt on the altar, and the
service was complete.

Both olapa and hoopaa took part in the performance of this hula. There
was little or no moving about, but the olapa did at times sink down to a
kneeling position. The performance was without instrumental
accompaniment, but with abundant appropriate gestures. The subjects
treated of were of such dignity and interest as to require no extraneous
embellishment.

Perusal of the mele which follows will show that the story of Pele dated
back of her arrival in this group:

*He Oli--O ka mele mua keia o ka hula Pele*

*A Song--The first song of the hula Pele*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

From Kahiki came the woman, Pele,  
From the land of Pola-pola,  
From the red cloud of Kane,  
Cloud blazing in the heavens,  
5 Fiery cloud-pile in Kahiki.

Eager desire for Hawaii seized the woman, Pele;  
She carved the canoe, Honua-i-a-kea,  
Your canoe, O Ka-moho-alii.  
They push the work on the craft to completion.  
10 The lashings of the god's canoe are done.  
The canoe of Kane, the world-maker.

The tides swirl, Pele-honua-mea o’ermounts them;  
The god rides the waves, sails about the island;  
The host of little gods ride the billows;  
15 Malau takes his seat;  
One bales out the bilge of the craft.  
Who shall sit astern, be steersman, O, princes?  
Pele of the yellow earth.  
The splash of the paddles dashes o’er the canoe.

20 Ku and his fellow, Lono,  
Disembark on solid land;  
They alight on a shoal.  
Hiiaka, the wise one, a god,  
Stands up, goes to stay at the house of Pele.

25 Lo, an eruption in Kahiki!  
A flashing of lightning, O Pele!  
Belch forth. O Pele!

</div>

Tradition has it that Pele was expelled from Kahiki by her brothers
because of insubordination, disobedience, and disrespect to their
mother, *Honua-mea*, sacred land. (If Pele in Kahiki conducted herself
as she has done in Hawaii, rending and scorching the bosom of mother
earth--Honua-Mea--it is not to be wondered that her brothers were
anxious to get rid of her.) She voyaged north. Her

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

first stop was at the little island of Ka-ula, belonging to the Hawaiian
group. She tunneled into the earth, but the ocean poured in and put a
stop to her work. She had the same experience on Lehua, on Niihau, and
on the large island of Kauai. She then moved on to Oahu, hoping for
better results; but though she tried both sides of the island, first
mount Ka-ala--the fragrant--and then Konahuanui, she still found the
conditions unsatisfactory. She passed on to Molokai, thence to Lanai,
and [to](errata.htm#5) West Maui, and East Maui, at which last place she
dug the immense pit of Hale-a-ka-la; but every-where she was
unsuccessful. Still journeying east and south, she crossed the wide
Ale-nui-haha channel and came to Hawaii, and, after exploring in all
directions, she was satisfied to make her home at Kilauea. Here is (*ka
piko o ka honua*) the navel of the earth. Apropos of this effort of Pele
to make a fire-pit for herself, see the song for the hula kuolo ([p.
86](ulh14.htm#page_86)), "A pit lies (far) to the east."

*Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

To Kauai, lifted in ether,  
A floating flower at sea of Wailua--  
That way Pele turns her gaze,  
She's bidding adieu to Oahu,  
5 Loved land of new wine of the palm.  
There comes a perfumed waft--mokihana--  
The bath of the maid Hiiaka.  
Scene it was once of Pele's contention,  
Put by for future attention.  
10 Her foot now spurns the long-backed wave;  
The phosphor burns like Pele's eye,  
Or a meteor-flash in the sky.  
Finished the prayer, enter, possess!

</div>

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

The incidents and allusions in this mele belong to the story of Pele's
journey in search of Lohiau, the lover she met in her dreams, and
describe her as about to take flight from Oahu to Kauai (verse 4).

Hiiaka's bath, *Wai ai auau o Hiiaka* (verse 7), which was the subject
of Pele's contention (verse 8), was a spring of water which Pele had
planted at Huleia on her arrival from Kahiki. The ones with whom Pele
had the contention were Kukui-lau-manienie and Kukui-lau-hanahana, the
daughters of Lima-loa, the god of the mirage. These two women lived at
Huleia near the spring. Kamapuaa, the swine-god, their accepted lover,
had taken the liberty to remove the spring from the rocky bed where Pele
had planted it to a neighboring hill. Pele was offended and demanded of
the two women:

"Where is my spring of water?"

"Where, indeed, is your spring? You belong to Hawaii. What have you to
do with any spring on Kauai?" was their answer.

"I planted a clean spring here on this rock," said Pele.

"You have no water here," they insisted; "your springs are on Hawaii."

"If I were not going in search of my husband Lohiau," said Pele, "I
would set that spring back again in its old place."

"You haven't the power to do that," said they. "The son of Kahikiula
(Kama-puaa) moved it over there, and you can't undo his action."

The eye of Pele, *He onohi no Pele* (verse 11), is the phosphorescence
which Pele's footfall stirs to activity in the ocean.

The formal ending of this mele, *Elieli, kau mai*, is often found at the
close of a mele in the hula Pele, and marks it as to all intents and
purposes a prayer.

*E waiho aku ana o Ahu* (verse 4). This is an instance of the separation
of the article o from the substantive *Ahu*, to which it becomes joined
to form the proper name of the island now called Oahu.

*Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

They bear the god's ax up the mountain;  
Trampling the mire, like waves from Kahiki  
That beat on the front of Kilauea.  
The people with offerings lift up a prayer;  
5 A woman strings wreaths in Olaa--  
Lehua grove mine bord’ring He-eia.  
And now Kukuena, mother god,  
Covers her loins with a pa-ú of ti leaf;  
She mounts the altar; she sits.  
10 Behold us, your conclave of priests.  
Enter in, possess us!

</div>

This has the marks of a Hawaiian prayer, and as such it is said to have
been used in old times by canoe-builders when going up into the
mountains in search of timber. Or it may have been recited by the
priests and people who went up to fell the lehua tree from which to
carve the Makahiki <span id="fr_343"></span>[a](#fn_335) idol; or,
again, may it possibly have been recited by the company of hula folk who
climbed the mountain in search of a tree to be set up in the halau as a
representation of the god whom they wished to honor? This is a question
the author can not settle. That it was used by hula folk is
indisputable, but that would not preclude its use for other purposes.

At Wailua stands the main house-post;  
This oracle harks to wild voices,  
Tumult and clamor, O Ulu-po;  
It utters no voice to entreaty.  
5 Alas for the prophet that's dumb!  
But there drifts the incense of hala.  
Maná sees the rain-whirl of Eleao.  
The robe of Ka-ú sways in the wind,  
That dashes the waves ’gainst the sea-wall,  
10 At Honu-apo, windy Ka-ú;  
The Pai-ha’a palms strive with the gale.  
Such weather is grievous to you:  
The sea-scud is flying.  
Fly little i-ao, O fly  
15 With the breeze Koolau!  
Fly with the Moa’e-ku!  
Look at the rain-mist fly!  
Leap with the cataract, leap!  
Plunge, now here, now there!  
20 Feet foremost, head foremost;  
Leap with a glance and a glide!  
Kauná opens the dance; you win.  
Rise, Hiiaka, arise!

</div>

The meaning of this mele centers about a phenomenon that is said to have
been observed at Pa-ipu-ha’a, near Wailua, on Kauai. To one standing on
a knoll near the two cliffs Ikuwa and Mahoena (verse 5) there came, it
is said, an echo from the murmur and clamor of the ocean and the moan of
the wind, a confused mingling of nature's voices. The listener, however,
got no echoing answer to his own call.

The mele does not stick to the unities as we understand them. The poets
of old Hawaii felt at liberty to run to the ends of their earth; and the
auditor must allow his imagination to be transported suddenly from one
island to another; in this case, first from Wailua to

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Maná on the same
island, where he is shown the procession of whirling rain clouds of
Eleao (verse 7). Thence the poet carries him to Honuapo, Hawaii, and
shows him the waves dashing against the ocean-walls and the clashing of
the palm-fronds of Paiaha’a in the wind.

The scene shifts back to Kauai, and one stands with the poet looking
down on a piece of ocean where the people are wont to disport
themselves. (Maka-iwa, not far from Ka-ipu-ha’a, is said to be such a
place.) Verses 12 to 19 in the Hawaiian (13 to 21 in the translation)
describe the spirited scene.

It is somewhat difficult to determine whether the Kauná mentioned in the
next poem is the name of the woman or of the stormy cape. In the mind of
a Hawaiian poet the inanimate and the animate are often tied so closely
together in thought and in speech as to make it hard to decide which is
intended.

This mele, based on a story of amorous rivalry, relates to a contest
which arose between two young women of rank regarding the favors of that
famous warrior and general of Kamehameha, Kalaimoku, whom the successful
intrigante described as *ka makua o makua* (verse 8), our father, i. e.,
our guardian. The point of view is that of the victorious intrigante,
and in speaking of her defeated rival she uses the ironical language of
the sixth verse, *He kanáka ke koa no ka ehu ahiahi*, meaning that her
opponent's chance of success faded with the evening twilight, whereas
her own success was crowned with the

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

glow of morning, O ia nei ko ka ehu kakahiaka (verse 7). The epithet
*kanáka* hints ironically that her rival is of lower rank than herself,
though in reality the rank of her rival may have been superior to her
own.

The language, as pointed out by the author's informant, is marked with
an elegance that stamps it as the product of a courtly circle.

After the death of Lohiau, his best friend, Paoa, came before Pele
determined to invite death by pouring out the vials of his wrath on the
head of the goddess. The sisters of Pele sought to avert the impending
tragedy and persuaded him to soften his language and to forego mere
abuse. Paoa, a consummate actor, by his dancing, which has been
perpetuated in the hula Pele, and by his skillfully-worded prayer-songs,
one of which is given above, not only appeased Pele, but won her.

The piece next appearing is also a song that was a prayer, and seems to
have been uttered by the same mouth that groaned forth the one given
above.

It does not seem necessary to take the language of the mele literally.
The sufferings that the person in the mele describes in the first
person, it seems to the author, may be those of his friend Lohiau; and
the first person is used for literary effect.

The mele now to be given has the form of a serenade. Etiquette forbade
anyone to wake the king by rude touch, but it was permissible for a near
relative to touch his feet. When the exigencies of business made it
necessary for a messenger, a herald, or a courtier to disturb the
sleeping monarch, he took his station at the king's feet and recited a
serenade such as this:

*Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Awake now, Kahiki-ku;  
Awake now, Kahiki-moe;  
Awake, ye gods of lower grade;  
Awake, ye gods of heavenly rank.  
5 A serenade to thee, O king.  
Awake thee!

Awake, it is day, it is light;  
The Day-god his arrows is shooting,  
Unulau his eye far-flashing,  
10 Canoe-men from Uku-me-hame  
Are astir to weather the windy cape,  
The boat-baffling cape, Papa-wai,  
And the boisterous A-nahe-nahe.  
Awake thee!

15 Awake, day is come and the light;  
The sun-rays stab the skin of the deep;  
It pursues, as did god Kumu-kahi  
To companion with god Maka-noni;  
The plain of Apua quivers with heat.  
20 Awake thee!

Awake, ’tis day, ’tis light;  
The sun stands over Waihoa,  
Afloat on the breast of ocean;  
The iwa of Leinoai is preening  
25 On the cliff Maka-iki-olea,  
On the breast of naked Lehua.  
Awake thee! awake!

The following is a prayer said to have been used at the time of
awa-drinking. When given in the hula, the author is informed, its
recitation was accompanied by the sound of the drum.

*A Prayer to Pele*

CANTO I

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Lo, Pele's the god of my choice:  
Let heaven and earth in silence wait  
Here is awa, potent, sacred,  
Bitter sea, great Hiiaka's root;

Awa to the women forbidden,  
Let it tabu be!

Exact be the rite of your awa,  
O Pele of the sacred land.

15 A health to the stranger gods?

CANTO II

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Bedeck now the board for the feast;  
Fill up the last bowl to the brim;

All hail to the stranger gods!  
This my offering, simply a voice,  
Only a welcoming voice.  
Turn in!  
25 Lo, the feast!

This prayer, though presented in two parts or cantos, is really one, its
purpose being to offer a welcome, *kanaenae*, to the feast and ceremony
to the gods who had a right to expect that courtesy.

When this poem <span id="fr_378"></span>[a](#fn_365) first came into the
author's hands, though attracted by its classic form and vigorous style,
he could not avoid being repelled by an evident grossness. An old
Hawaiian, to whom he stated his objections, assured him that the mele
was innocent of all bad intent, and when the offensive word was pointed
out he protested that it was an interloper. The substitution of the
right word showed that the man was correct. The offense was at once
removed. This set the whole poem in a new light and it is presented with
satisfaction. The mele is properly a name-song, *mele-inoa*. The poet
represents some one as lifting a name to his mouth for praise and
adulation. He tells him to take it to Kilauea--that it may reecho,
doubtless, from the walls of the crater.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_330"></span>[189:a](ulh28.htm#fr_337) *Olewa*. Said to be
the name of a wooded region high up on the mountain of Kauai. It is here
treated as if it meant the heavens or the blue ether. Its origin is the
same with the word *lewa*, the upper regions of the air.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[189:b](ulh28.htm#fr_338) *O Ahu*. In this
instance the article still finds itself disunited from its substantive.
To-day we have *Oahu* and *Ola’a*.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[189:c](ulh28.htm#fr_340) *Kau*. The summer;
time of warm weather; the growing season.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[190:a](ulh28.htm#fr_341) The figure in the
second and third verses, of waves from Kahiki (*nalu mai Kahiki*)
beating against the front of Kilauea (*Po-po’i aku la i ke alo o
Kilauea*), seems to picture the trampling of the multitude splashing the
mire as if it were, waves of ocean.

<span id="fn_334"></span>[190:b](ulh28.htm#fr_342) *Kukuena*. There is
some uncertainty as to who this character was; probably the same as
Haumea, the mother of Pele.

<span id="fn_335"></span>[191:a](ulh28.htm#fr_343) For an account of the
Makahiki idol see Hawaiian Antiquities, p. 159, by David Maio;
translated by N. B. Emerson, A. M., M. D., Honolulu, Hawaiian Gazette
Company (Limited), 1903.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[191:b](ulh28.htm#fr_344) *Pou hale*. The main
post of a house, which is here intended, was the *pou-haná*; it was
regarded with a superstitious reverence.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[191:c](ulh28.htm#fr_345) *A’hu o Ka-u*. A
reference, doubtless, to the long grass that once covered Ka-ú.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[191:d](ulh28.htm#fr_346) *I-áo*. A small fish
that took short flights in the air.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[192:a](ulh28.htm#fr_347) *Lele kawa*. To jump
in sport from a height into the water.

<span id="fn_340"></span>[192:b](ulh28.htm#fr_348) *Lele o-ó*. To leap
feet first into the water.

<span id="fn_341"></span>[192:c](ulh28.htm#fr_349) *O-ó lele*. To dive
head first into the water.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[192:d](ulh28.htm#fr_350) *Lele opuhi*. The
same as *pahi’a*, to leap obliquely into the water from a height,
bending oneself so that the feet come first to the surface.

<span id="fn_343"></span>[192:e](ulh28.htm#fr_351) Kauná. A woman of
Ka-ú celebrated for her skill in the hula, also the name of a cape that
reaches out into the stormy ocean.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[194:a](ulh28.htm#fr_352) Pele is often spoken
of as *ka luahine*, the old woman: but she frequently used her power of
transformation to appear as a young woman of alluring beauty.

<span id="fn_345"></span>[194:b](ulh28.htm#fr_353) Lava poured out in
plates and folds and coils resembles may diverse things, among others
the canoe, *wa’a*, here characterized as complete in its appointments
and ready for launching, *kauhí*. The words are subtly intended, no
doubt, to convey the thought of Pele's readiness to launch on the voyage
of matrimony.

<span id="fn_346"></span>[194:c](ulh28.htm#fr_356) *Pepe*, a seat;
*kiele*, to paddle; and *ulu*, a shortened form of the old word *oulu*,
meaning a paddle, are archaisms now obsolete.

<span id="fn_347"></span>[194:d](ulh28.htm#fr_357) *Nihéu*. One of the
mythological heroes of an old-time adventure, in which his elder brother
Kana, who had the form of a long rope, played the principal part. This
one enterprise of their life in which they joined forces was for the
rescue of their mother, Hina, who had been [kidnapped](errata.htm#6) by
a marauding chief and carried from her home in Hilo to the bold headland
of Haupu, Molokai. Niheu is generally stigmatized as *kolohe* (verse
11), mischievous, for no other reason apparently than that he was an
active spirit, full of courage, given to adventure and heaven-defying
audacities, such as put the Polynesian Mawi and the Greek Prometheus in
had odor with the gods of their times. One of these offensive actions
was Nihéu's theft of a certain *ulu*, breadfruit, which one of the gods
rolled with a noise like that of thunder in the underground caverns of
the southern regions of the world. Nihéu is represented as a great
sport, an athlete, skilled in all the games of his people. The worst
that could be said of him was that he had small regard for other
people's rights and that he was slow to pay his debts of honor.

<span id="fn_348"></span>[195:a](ulh28.htm#fr_358) The remarks on pp.
[194](#page_194) and [195](#page_195) regarding the mele on [p.
194](#page_194) are mostly applicable to this mele.

<span id="fn_349"></span>[195:b](ulh28.htm#fr_359) *Kau-meli-eli*. The
name of the double canoe which brought a company of the gods from the
lands of the South--Kukulo o Kahiki--to Hawaii. Hawaiian myths refer to
several migrations of the gods to Hawaii; one of them is that described
in the mele given on [p. 187](#page_187), the first mele in this
chapter.

<span id="fn_350"></span>[196:a](ulh28.htm#fr_361) Hawaiians conceived
of the dome of heaven as a solid structure supported by walls that
rested on the earth's plain. Different names were given to different
sections of the wall. *Kahiki-ku* and *Kahiki-moe* were names applied to
certain of these sections. It would, however, be too much to expect any
Hawaiian, however intelligent and well versed in old lore, to indicate
the location of these regions.

<span id="fn_351"></span>[196:b](ulh28.htm#fr_363) The words *apapa
nu’u* and *apapa lani*, which convey to the mind of the author the
picture of a series of terraced plains or steppes--no doubt the original
meaning--here mean a family or order of gods, not of the highest rank,
at or near the head of which stood Pele. Apropos of this subject the
following lines have been quoted:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Hanau ke apapa nu’u:  
Hanau ke apapa lani;  
Hanau Pele, ka hihi’o na lani.

</div>

\[Translation\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Begotten were the gods of graded rank;  
Begotten were the gods of heavenly rank;  
Begotten was Pele, quintessence of heaven.

</div>

This same expression was sometimes used to mean an order of chiefs,
*alii*. *Apapa lani* was also used to mean the highest order of gods,
*Ku*, *Kane*, *Kanaloa*, *Lono*. The kings also were gods, for which
reason this expression at times applied to the alii of highest rank,
those, for instance, who inherited the rank of *niau-pi’o* or of *wohi*.

<span id="fn_352"></span>[196:c](ulh28.htm#fr_364) *Lani*. Originally
the heavens, came to mean king. chief, *alii*.

<span id="fn_353"></span>[196:d](ulh28.htm#fr_365) There is a difference
of opinion as to the meaning of *Kape’a ma*. After hearing diverse
opinions the author concludes that it refers to the rays of the sun that
precede its rising--a Greek idea.

<span id="fn_354"></span>[196:e](ulh28.htm#fr_366) *Unulau*. A name for
the trade-wind which, owing to the conformation of the land, often
sweeps down with great force through the deep valleys that seam the
mountains of west Maui between Lahaina and Maalaea bay; such a wind
squall was called a *mumuku*.

<span id="fn_355"></span>[197:a](ulh28.htm#fr_367) *Ukumehame*. The name
of a deep valley on west Maui in the region above described.

<span id="fn_356"></span>[197:b](ulh28.htm#fr_368) *Papawai*. The
principal cape on west Maui between Lahaina and Maalaea bay.

<span id="fn_357"></span>[197:c](ulh28.htm#fr_369) *Kumu-kahi*. A cape
in Puna, the easternmost part of Hawaii; by some said to be the sun's
wife, and the object of his eager pursuit after coming out of his
eastern gate Ha’eha’e. The name was also applied to a pillar of stone
that was planted on the northern border of this cape. Standing opposite
to it, on the southern side, was the monolith Makanoni. In summer the
sun in its northern excursion inclined, as the Hawaiians noted, to the
side of Kumukahi, while in the season of cool weather, called Makalii,
it swung in the opposite direction and passed over to Makanoni. The
people of Puna accordingly said, "The sun has passed over to Makanoni,"
or "The sun has passed over to Kumukahi," as the case might be. These
two pillars are said to be of such a form as to suggest the thought that
they are phallic emblems, and this conjecture is strengthened by
consideration of the tabus connected with them and of the religious
ceremonies [performed](errata.htm#7) before them. The Hawaiians speak of
them as *pohaku eho*, which, the author believes, is the name given to a
phallus, and describe them as plain uncarved pillars.

These stones were set up in very ancient times and are said to have been
tabu to women at the times of their infirmity. If a woman climbed upon
them at such a period or even set foot upon the platform on which one of
them stood she was put to death. Another stringent tabu forbade anyone
to perform an office of nature while his face was turned toward one of
these pillars.

The language of the mele, *Ke hahai ae la e like me Kumukahi* (verse
16), implies that the sun chased after Kumukahi. Apropos of this is the
following quotation from an article on the phallus in Chambers's
Encyclopedia: "The common myth concerning it \[the phallus\] was the
story of some god deprived of his power of generation--an allusion to
the sun, which in autumn loses its fructifying influence."

In modern times there seems to have grown up a curious mixture of
traditions about these two stones, in which the old have become overlaid
with new superstitions; and these last in turn seem to be dying out.
They are now vaguely remembered as relics of old demigods, petrified
forms of ancient *kupua*. <span id="fr_370"></span>[1](#fn_358)
Fishermen, it is said, not long ago offered sacrifices to them, hoping
thus to purchase good luck. Any offense against them, such as that by
women, above mentioned, or by men, was atoned for by offering before
these ancient monuments the first fish that came to the fisherman's hook
or net.

Mention of the name Kumu-kahi to a Hawaiian versed in ancient lore
called up to his memory the name of Pala-moa as his associate. The
account this old man gave of them was that they were demigods much
worshiped and feared for their power and malignity. They were reputed to
be cannibals on the sly, and, though generally appearing in human form,
were capable of various metamorphoses, thus eluding detection. They were
believed to have the power of taking possession of men through spiritual
obsession, as a result of which the obsessed ones were enabled to heal
sickness as well as to cause it, to reveal secrets, and to inflict
death, thus terrifying people beyond measure. The names of these two
demigods, especially that of Palamoa, are to this day appealed to by
practitioners of the black arts.

<span id="fn_358"></span>[197:1](ulh28.htm#fr_370) The Hawaiian alphabet
had no letter *s*. The Hawaiians indicated the plural by prefixing the
particle *na*.

<span id="fn_359"></span>[198:a](ulh28.htm#fr_371) *Mauli-ola*. A god of
health; perhaps also the name of a place. The same word also was applied
to the breath of life, or to the physician's power of healing. In the
Maori tongue the word *mauri*, corresponding to *mauli*, means life. the
seat of life. In Samoan the word *mauli* means heart. "Sneeze, living
heart " (*Tihe mauri ora*), says the Maori mother to her infant when it
sneezes. For this bit of Maori lore acknowledgment is due to Mr. S.
Percy Smith, of New Zealand.

<span id="fn_360"></span>[199:a](ulh28.htm#fr_374) According to one
authority, at the close of the first canto the stranger gods--*akua
malihini*--who consisted of that multitude of godlings called the *Kini
Akua*, took their departure from the ceremony, since they did not belong
to the Pele family. Internal evidence, however, the study of the prayer
itself in its two parts, leads the writer to disagree with this
authority. Other Hawaiians of equally deliberate judgment support him in
this opinion. The etiquette connected with ceremonious awa-drinking,
which the Samoans of to-day still maintain in full form, long ago died
out in Hawaii. This etiquette may never have been cultivated here to the
same degree as in its home, Samoa; but this poem is evidence that the
ancient Hawaiians paid greater attention to it than they of modern
times. The reason for this decline of ceremony must be sought for in the
mental and esthetic make-up of the Hawaiian people; it was not due to
any lack of fondness in the Hawaiian for awa as a beverage or as an
intoxicant. It is no help to beg the question by ascribing the decline
of this etiquette to the influence of social custom. To do so would but
add one more link to the chain that binds cause to effect. The Hawaiian
mind was not favorable to the observance of this sort of etiquette; it
did not afford a soil fitted to nourish such an artificial growth.

<span id="fn_361"></span>[199:b](ulh28.htm#fr_373) The meaning of the
word Ku-ka-la-ula presented great difficulty and defied all attempts at
translation until the suggestion was made by a bright Hawaiian, which
was adopted with satisfaction, that it probably referred to that state
of dreamy mental exaltation which comes with awa-intoxication. This
condition, like that of frenzy, of madness, and of idiocy, the Hawaiian
regarded as a divine possession.

<span id="fn_362"></span>[200:a](ulh28.htm#fr_375) Kalakaua, for whom
all these fine words are intended, could no more claim kinship with
Ku-nui-akea, the son of Kau-i-ke-aouli, than with Julius Caesar.

<span id="fn_363"></span>[200:b](ulh28.htm#fr_376) *Hale-mau-mau*. Used
figuratively of the mouth, whose hairy fringe--moustache and
beard--gives it a fancied resemblance to the rough lava pit where Pele
dwelt. The figure, to us no doubt obscure, conveyed to the Hawaiian the
idea of trumpeting the name and making it famous.

<span id="fn_364"></span>[200:c](ulh28.htm#fr_377) *E kuli-pe’e nui
ai-ahua*. Pele is here figured as an old, infirm woman, crouching and
crawling along; a character and attitude ascribed to her, no doubt, from
the fancied resemblance of a lava flow, which, when in the form of
*a-á*, rolls and tumbles along over the surface of the ground in a
manner suggestive of the motions and attitude of a palsied crone.

<span id="fn_365"></span>[201:a](ulh28.htm#fr_378) It is said to be the
work of a hula-master, now some years dead, by the name of Namakeelua.
