PLATE VII  
IPU HULA, GOURD DRUM  
</span>

 

# X.--THE HULA PA-ÍPU, OR KUÓLO

The *pa-ípu*, called also the *kuólo*, was a hula of dignified
character, in which all the performers maintained the kneeling position
and accompanied their songs with the solemn tones of the ipu ([pl.
VII](#img_pl07)), with which each one was provided. The proper handling
of this drumlike instrument in concert with the cantillation of the mele
made such demands upon the artist, who was both singer and
instrumentalist, that only persons of the most approved skill and
experience were chosen to take part in the performance of this hula.

The manner of treating the ípu in this hula differed somewhat from that
employed in the ala’a-papa, being subdued and quiet in that, whereas in
the pa-ípu it was at times marked with great vigor and
demonstrativeness, so that in moments of excitement and for the
expression of passion, fierce joy, or grief the ípu might be lifted on
high and wildly brandished. It thus made good its title as the most
important instrument of the Hawaiian orchestra.

In the pa-ípu, as in the hulas generally, while the actors were
sometimes grouped according to sex, they were quite as often distributed
indiscriminately, the place for the leader, the kumu, being the center.

The vigor that marks the literary style of the mele now given stamps it
as belonging to the archaic period, which closed in the early part of
the eighteenth century, that century which saw the white man make his
advent in Hawaii. The poem deals apparently with an incident in one of
the migrations such as took place during the period of intercourse
between the North and the South Pacific. This was a time of great stir
and contention, a time when there was much paddling and sailing about
and canoe-fleets, often manned by warriors, traversed the great ocean in
every direction. It was then that Hawaii received many colonists from
the archipelagoes that lie to the southward.

The intricately twisted language of this mele is allegorical, a rope
whose strands are inwrought with passion, envy, detraction, and abuse.
In translating it one has to choose between the poetic verbal garb and
the esoteric meaning which the bard made to lurk beneath the surface.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The iwa flies heavy to nest in the brush,  
Its haunt on windy Ke-ula.  
The watch-bird, that feuds off the rain from Le-hu-a--<span
id="page_77">p. 77</span>  
Bird sacred to Ku-hai, the shark-god--  
5 Shrieks, "Light not on terrace of Lei-no-ai,  
Lest Unu-lau fiercely assail you."  
Storm sweeps the cliffs of the islet;  
A covert they seek neath the hills,  
In the sheltered lee of the gale,  
10 The cove at the base of Le-hu-a.  
The shady groves there enchant them,  
The scarlet plumes of lehua.  
Love-dalliance now by the water-reeds,  
Till cooled and appeased by the rain-mist.  
15 Pour on, thou rain, the two heads press the pillow:  
Lo, prince and princess stir in their sleep!

</div>

The scene of this mele is laid on one of the little bird-islands that
lie to the northwest of Kauai. The *iwa* bird, flying heavily to his
nesting place in the wiry grass (*kala-pahee*), symbolizes the flight of
a man in his deep-laden pirogue, abducting the woman of his love. The
screaming sea-birds that warn him off the island, represented as
watch-guards of the shark-god Kuhai-moana (whose reef is still pointed
out), figure the outcries of the parents and friends of the abducted
woman.

After the first passionate outburst (*Puni’a iluna o ka Halau-a ola*)
things go more smoothly (*ola* \* \* \*). The flight to covert from the
storm, the cove at the base of Le-hu-a, the shady groves, the scarlet
pompons of the lehua--the tree and the island have the same name--all
these things are to be interpreted figuratively as emblems of woman's
physical charms and the delights of love-dalliance.

CANTO III

(In turgid style)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A storm from the sea strikes Ke-au,  
Ulu-mano, sweeping across the barrens;  
It sniffs the fragrance of upland lehua,  
Turns back at Kupa-koili;  
5 Sawed by the blows of the palm leaves,  
The groves of pandanus in lava shag;  
Their fruit he would string ’bout his neck;  
Their fruit he finds wilted and crushed,  
Mere rubbish to litter the road--  
10 Ah, the perfume! Pana-ewa is drunk with the scent;  
The breath of it spreads through the groves.  
Vainly flares the old king's passion.  
Craving a sauce for his meat and mine.  
The summer has flown: winter has come:  
15 All. that is the head of our troubles.  
Palsied are you and helpless am I;  
You shrink from a plunge in the water;  
Alas, poor me! I'm a coward.

</div>

The imagery of this mele sets forth the story of the fierce, but
fruitless, love-search of a chief, who is figured by the *Ulu-mano*, a
boisterous wind of Puna. Hawaii. The fragrance of upland lehua (*moani
lehua a’e la mauka*, verse 3) typifies the charms of the woman he
pursues. The expression haul *kani lehua* (verse 4), literally the
sudden ending of a rain-squall, signifies the man's failure to gain his
object. The lover seeks to string the golden drupe of the pandanus
(*hala*), that he may wear them as a wreath about his neck (*uwalo*);
the is wounded by the teeth of the sword-leaves (*o ia i ka lau o ka
hala*, verse 5). More than this, he meets powerful, concerted resistance
(*ke poo o ka hala o ke aku’i*, verse offered by the compact groves of
pandanus that grow in the rough lava-shag (*aku’i*), typifying, no
doubt, the resistance made by the friends and retainers of the woman.
After all, he finds, or declares that he finds, the hala fruit he had
sought to gather and to wear as a *lei* about his neck, to be spoiled,
broken, fit only to litter the road (*loli ka mu’o o ka hala*, verse 8:
*A helelei ka pua, a pili ke alanui*. verse 9). In spite of his repulse
and his villification of the woman, his passion still feeds on the
thought of the one he has lost; her charms intoxicate his imagination,
even as the perfume of the hala bloom bewitches the air of Pana-ewa (*Pu
ia Pana-ewa, ona-ona i ke ala*, verse 10).

It is difficult to interpret verses 12 to 18 in harmony with the story
as above given. They may be regarded as a commentary on the

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

passionate episode in the life of the lover, looked at from the
standpoint of old age, at a time when passion still survives but
physical strength is in abeyance.

As the sugar-boiler can not extract from the stalk the last grain of
sugar, so the author finds it impossible in any translation to express
the full intent of these Hawaiian mele.

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

The heaping up of adulations, of which this mele is a capital instance,
was not peculiar to Hawaiian poetry. The Roman Senate bestowed divinity
on its emperors by vote; the Hawaiian bard laureate, careering on his
Pegasus, thought to accomplish the same end by piling Ossa on Pelion
with high-flown phrases; and every loyal subject added his contribution
to the cairn that grew heavenward.

In Hawaii, as elsewhere, the times of royal debasement, of aristocratic
degeneracy, of doubtful or disrupted succession, have always been the
times of loudest poetic insistence on birth-rank and the occasion for
the most frenzied utterance of high-sounding titles. This is a disease
that has grown with the decay of monarchy.

Applying this criterion to the mele above given, it may be judged to be
by no means a product wholly of the archaic period. While certain parts,
say from the first to the tenth verses, inclusive, bear the mark of
antiquity, the other parts do not ring clear. It seems as if some poet
of comparatively modern times had revamped an old mele to suit his own
ends. Of this last part two verses were so glaringly an interpolation
that they were expunged from the text.

The effort to translate into pure Anglo-Saxon this vehement outpour of
high-colored phrases has made heavy demands on the vocabulary and has
strained the idioms of our speech well-nigh to the point of protest.

In lines 1, 2, 4, 8, 14, and 23 the word *Lani* means a prince or
princess, a high chief or king, a heavenly one. In lines 12, 13, 18, and
20 the same word *lani* means the heavens, a concept in the Hawaiian
mind that had some far-away approximation to the Olympus of classic
Greece.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Methinks it is you, leaf plucked from Love's tree,  
You mayhap, that stirs my affection.  
There's a tremulous glance of the eye,  
The thought she might chance yet to come:  
5 But who then would greet her with song?  
Your day has flown, your vision of her--  
A time this for gnawing the heart.  
I've plunged just now in deep waters:  
Oh the strife and vexation of soul!  
10 No mortal goes scathless of love.  
A wife thou estranged, I a husband estranged,  
Mere husks to be cast to the swine. <span
id="fr_205"></span>[a](#fn_202)  
Look, the swarming of fish at the weir!  
Their feeding grounds on the reef  
15 Are waving with mosses abundant.  
Thou art the woman, that one your man--  
At her coming who'll greet her with song?  
Her returning, who shall console?

</div>

This song almost explains itself. It is the soliloquy of a lover
estranged from his mistress. Imagination is alive in eye and ear to
everything that may bring tidings of her, even of her unhoped-for
return. Sometimes he speaks as if addressing the woman who has gone from
him, or he addresses himself, or he personifies some one who speaks to
him, as in the sixth line: "Your day has flown, \* \* \*."

The memory of past vexation and anguish extorts the philosophic remark,
"No mortal goes scathless of love." He gives over the past, seeks
consolation in a new attachment--he dives, *lu’u*, into the great ocean,
"deep waters," of love, at least in search of love. The old self
(selves), the old love, he declares to be only *alualu*, empty husks.

He--it is evidently a man--sets forth the wealth of comfort, opulence,
that surrounds him in his new-found peace. The scene, being laid in the
land Kailua, Oahu--the place to which the enchanted tree
*Maka-léi* <span id="fr_206"></span>[b](#fn_203) was carried long ago,
from which time its waters abounded in fish--fish are naturally the
symbol of the opulence that now bless his life. But, in spite of the
new-found peace and prosperity that attend him, there is a lonely corner
in his heart; the old question echoes in its vacuum, "Who'll greet her
with song? \* \* \* who shall console? "

Ewa's lagoon is red with dirt--  
Dust blown by the cool Moa’e,  
A plumage red on the taro leaf,  
An ocherous tint in the bay.

5 Say not in your heart that I am the culprit.  
Not I, but they, are at fault.  
No child of the womb is to blame.  
There goes, likely he is the one.  
Who was it blabbed of the bed defiled?

10 It must have been one of that band.  
But look at the rank grass beat down--  
For my part, I tripped, the other one smiled.  
You smiled in your hour of pleasure;  
But now, when crossed, how you scold!

15 Avoiding the house, averting the eyes--  
You make of me a mere stranger.  
Yes it's probably so, he's the one.

</div>

A poem this full of local color. The plot of the story, as it may be
interpreted, runs somewhat as follows: While the man of the house,
presumably, is away, it would seem--fishing, perhaps, in the waters of
Ewa's "shamrock lagoon"--the mistress sports with a lover. The culprit
impudently defends himself with chaff and dust-throwing. The hoodlums,
one of whom is himself the sinner, have been blabbing, says he.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

His accuser points to the beaten down *hina-hina* grass as evidence
against him. At this the brazen-faced culprit parries the stroke with a
humorous euphemistic description, in which he plays on the word *hina*,
to fall. Such verbal tilting in ancient Hawaii was practically a defense
against a charge. of moral obliquity as decisive and legitimate as was
an appeal to arms in the times of chivalry. He euphemistically speaks of
the beaten herbage as the result of his having tripped and fallen, at
which, says he, the woman smiled, that is she fell in with his
proposals. He gives himself away; but that doesn't matter.

It requires some study to make out who is the speaker in the tit-for-tat
of the dialogue.

Song

(In turgid style)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A pit lies (far) to the East,  
Pit het by the Fire-queen Pele.  
Heaven's dawn is lifted askew.  
One edge tilts up, one down, in the sky:  
5 The thud of the pick is heard in the ground.  
The question is asked by Wakea,  
What god ’s this a-digging?  
It is I, it is Pele,  
Who dug Niihau deep down till it burned,  
10 Dug fire-pit red-heated by Pele.

Night's curtains are drawn to one side,  
One lifts, one hangs in the tide.  
Crunch of spade resounds in the earth.  
Wakea ’gain urges the query,  
15 What god plies the spade in the ground?  
Quoth Pele, ’tis I: <span id="page_87">p. 87</span>  
I mined to the fire heath Kauai,  
On Kauai I dug deep a pit,  
A fire-well flame-fed by Pele.

20 The heavens are lifted aslant,  
One border moves up and one down;  
There's a stroke of o-ó ’neath the ground.  
Wakea, in earnest, would know,  
What demon's a-grubbing below?  
25 I am the worker, says Pele:  
Oahu I pierced to the quick,  
A crater white-heated by Pele.

Now morn lights one edge of the sky:  
The light streams up, the shadows fall down;  
30 There's a clatter of tools deep down.  
Wakea, in passion, demands,  
What god this who digs ’neath the ground?  
It is dame Pele who answers;  
Hers the toil to dig down to fire,  
35 To dig Molokai and reach fire.

Now morning peeps from the sky  
With one eye open, one shut.  
Hark, ring of the drill ’neath the plain!  
Wakea asks you to explain,  
40 What imp is a-drilling below?  
It is I, mutters Pele:  
I drilled till flame shot forth on Lanai,  
A pit candescent by Pele.

The morning looks forth aslant;  
45 Heaven's curtains roll up and roll down;  
There's a ring of o-o ’neath the sod.  
Who, asks Wakea, the god,  
Who is this devil a-digging?  
’Tis I, ’tis Pele, I who  
50 Dug on Maui the pit to the fire:  
Ah, the crater of Maui,  
Red-glowing with Pele's own fire!

Heaven's painted one side by the dawn,  
Her curtains half open, half drawn;  
55 A rumbling is heard far below.  
Wakea insists he will know  
The name of the god that tremors the land.  
’Tis I, grumbles Pele,  
I have scooped out the pit Hu'e-hu'e,  
60 A pit that reaches to fire,  
A fire fresh kindled by Pele.

Now day climbs up to the East;  
Morn folds the curtains of night;  
The spade of sapper resounds ’neath the plain:  
65 The goddess is at it again!

This mele comes to us stamped with the hall-mark of antiquity. It is a
poem of mythology, but with what story it connects itself, the author
knows not.

The translation here given makes no profession of absolute, verbal
literalness. One can not transfer a metaphor bodily, head and horns,
from one speech to another. The European had to invent a new name for
the boomerang or accept the name by which the Australian called it. The
Frenchman, struggling with the English language, told a lady he was
*gangrened*; he meant he was *mortified*. The cry for literalism is the
cry for an impossibility; to put the chicken back into its shell, to
return to the bows and arrows of the stone age.

To make the application to the mele in question: the word *ha-olo-olo*,
for example, which is translated in several different ways in the poem,
is of such generic and comprehensive meaning that one word fails to
express its meaning. It is, by the way, not a word to be found in any
dictionary. The author had to grope his way to its meaning by following
the trail of some Hawaiian pathfinder who, after beating about the bush,
finally had to acknowledge that the path had become so much overgrown
since he last went that way that he could not find it.

The Arabs have a hundred or more words meaning sword--different kinds of
swords. To them our word sword is very unspecific. Talk to an Arab of a
sword--you may exhaust the list of special forms that our poor
vocabulary compasses, straight sword, broadsword, saber, scimitar,
yataghan, rapier, and what not, and yet not hit the mark of his
definition.

A burst of smoke from the pit lifts to the skies;  
Hawaii ’s beneath, birth-land of Keawe;  
Malama's beach looms before Lohiau,  
Where landed the chief from Kahiki,  
5 From a voyage on the blue sea, the dark sea,  
The foam-mottled sea of Kane,  
What time curled waves of the king-whelming flood.  
The sea up-swells, invading the land--

Lo Kane, outstretched at his ease!  
10 Smoke and flame o’ershadow the uplands,  
Conflagration by Laka, the woman  
Hopoe wreathed with flowers of lehua,  
Stringing the pandanus fruit.  
Screw-palms that clash in Pan’-ewa--  
15 Pan’-ewa, whose groves of lehua  
Are nourished by lava shag,  
Lehua that bourgeons with flame.

For the people salvation!  
But the land is on fire!

The Hawaiian who furnished the meles which, in their translated forms,
are designated as canto I, canto II, and so on, spoke of them as *pále*;
and, following his nomenclature, the term has been retained, though more
intimate acquaintance with the meles and with the term has shown that
the nearest English synonym to correspond with *pále* would be the word
division. Still, perhaps with a mistaken tenderness for the word, the
author has retained the caption Canto, as a sort of nodding recognition
of the old Hawaiian's term--division of a poem. No idea is entertained
that the five *pále* above given were composed by the same bard, or that
they represent productions from the same individual standpoint. They do,
however, breathe a spirit much in common; so that when the old Hawaiian
insisted that they are so far related to one another as to form a
natural series for recitation in the hula, being species of the same
genus, as it were, he was not far from the truth. The man's idea seemed
to be that they were so closely related that, like beads of harmonious
colors and shapes, they might be strung on the same thread without
producing a dissonance.

Of these five poems, or *pále* (páh-lay), numbers I, II, and IV were
uttered in a natural tone of voice, termed *kawele*, otherwise termed
*ko’i-honua*. The purpose of this style of recitation was to adapt the
tone to the necessities of the aged when their ears no longer

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

heard distinctly. It would require an audiphone to illustrate perfectly
the difference between this method of pronunciation and the *ai-ha’a*,
which was employed in the recitation of cantos III and V. The *ai-ha’a*
was given in a strained and guttural tone.

The poetical reciter and cantillator, whether in the halau or in the
king's court, was wont to heighten the oratorical effect of his
recitation by certain crude devices, the most marked of which was that
of choking the voice down, as it were, into the throat, and there
letting it strain and growl like a hungry lion. This was the ai-ha’a,
whose organic function was the expression of the underground passions of
the soul.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_188"></span>[74:a](ulh14.htm#fr_191) *Olopana*. A
celebrated king of Waipio valley. Hawaii, who had to wife the famous
beauty, Luukia. Owing to misfortune, he sailed away to *Kahiki*, taking
with him his wife and his younger brother, Moikeha, who was his
*pupa-lua*, settling in a land called *Moa-ula-nui-akea*. Olopana
probably ended his days in his new-found home, but Moi-keha, heart-sick
at the loss of Luukia's favors, came back to Hawaii and became the
progenitor of a line of distinguished men, several of whom were famous
navigators. Exactly what incident in the life of Olopana is alluded to
in the sixth and preceding verses, the traditions that narrate his
adventures do not inform us.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[74:b](ulh14.htm#fr_192) *Hei kapu*. An oracle;
the place where the high priest kept himself while consulting the
deities of the heiau. It was a small house erected on an elevated
platform of stones, and there he kept himself in seclusion at such times
as he sought to be the recipient of communications from the gods.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[74:c](ulh14.htm#fr_193) *Hana-ka-ulani*. A
name applied to several heiau (temples). The first one so styled,
according to tradition, was built at Hana, Maui, and another one at
Kaluanui, on Oahu. near the famous valley of Ka-liu-wa’a. These heiau
are said to have been built by the gods in the misty past soon after
landing on these shores. Was it to celebrate their escape from perils by
sea and enemies on land, or was it in token of thankfulness to gods
still higher than themselves?

The author's informant can not tell whether these followed the fierce,
strict cult of Kane or the milder cult of Lono.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[74:d](ulh14.htm#fr_194) *Hoo-mamao-lani*. An
epithet meaning remote in the heavens, applied to an alai of very high
rank.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[74:e](ulh14.htm#fr_195) *Keawe*. This is a
name that belonged to several kings and a large family of gods--*papa
akua*--all of which gods are said to have come from Kahiki and to have
dated their origin from the *Wa Po*, the twilight of antiquity. Among
the demigods that were called *Keawe* may be mentioned: (1)
*Keawe-huli*, a prophet and soothsayer. (2) *Keawe-kilo-pono*, a wise
and righteous one, who loved justice. (3) *Keawe-hulu-maemae*. It was
his function to maintain purity and cleanliness; he was a devouring
flame that destroyed rubbish and all foulness. (4)
*Keawe-ula-o-ka-lani*. This was the poetical appellation given to the
delicate flush of early morning. Apropos of this the Hawaiians have the
following quatrain, which they consider descriptive not only of morning
blush, but also of the coming in of the reign of the gods:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

O Keawe-ula-i-ka-lani,  
O Keawe-liko-i-ka-lani,  
O Keawe-uina-pohá-i-Kahiki;  
Hiki mai alma o Lono.

</div>

\[Translation\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Keawe-the-red-blush-of-dawn,  
Keawe-the-bud-in-the-sky,  
Keawe-thunder-burst-at-Kahiki:  
Till Lono comes in to reign.

</div>

\(5\) *Keawe-pa-makani*. It was his function to send winds from
*Kukulu-o-Kahiki*, as well as from some other points. (6)
*Keawe-ío-ío-moa*. This god inspected the ocean tides and currents, such
as *Au-miki* and *Au-ká*. (7) *Keawe-i-ka-liko*. He took charge of
flower-buds and tender shoots, giving them a chance to develop. (8)
*Keawe-ulu-pu*. It was his function to promote the development and
fruitage of plants. (9) *Keawe-lu-pua*. He caused flowers to shed their
petals. (10) *Keawe-opala*. It was his thankless task to create rubbish
and litter by scattering the leaves of the trees. (11) *Keawe-hulu*, a
magician, who could blow a feather into the air and see it at once
become a bird with power to fly away. (12) *Keawe-nui-ka-ua-o-Hilo*, a
sentinel who stood guard by night and by day to watch over all creation.
(13) *Keawe-pulehu*. He was a thief and served as cook for the gods.
There were gods of evil as well as of good in this set. (14)
*Keawe-oili*. He was <span id="page_75">p. 75</span> gifted with the
power to convey and transfer evil, sickness, misfortune, and death. (15)
*Keawe-kaili*. He was a robber. (16) *Keawe-aihue*. He was a thief. (17)
*Keawe-makilo*. He was a beggar. He would stand round while others were
preparing food, doing honest work, and plead with his eyes. In this way
he often obtained a dole. (16) *Keawe-puni-pua’a*. He was a glutton,
very greedy of pork; he was also called *Keawe-ai-pua’u*. (19)
*Keawe-inoino*. He was a sloven, unclean in all his ways. (20)
*Keawe-ilio*. The only title to renown of this superhuman creature was
his inordinate fondness for the flesh of the dog. So far none of the
superhuman beings mentioned seemed fitted to the rule of the Keawe of
the text, who was passionately fond of the sea. The author had given up
in despair, when one day, on repeating his inquiry in another quarter,
he was rewarded by learning of--(21) *Keawe-i-na-kai*. He was a resident
of the region about the southeastern point of Molokai, called
*Lae-ka-Ilio*--Cape of the Dog. He was extravagantly fond of the ocean
and allowed no weather to interfere with the indulgence of his penchant.
An epithet applied to him describes his dominating passion: *Keawe moe i
ke kai o Kohakú*, Keawe who sleeps in (or on) the sea of Kohakú. It
seems probable that this was the Keawe mentioned in the twelfth and
thirteenth lines of the mele.

The appellation Keawe seems to have served as a sort of Jack among the
demigods of the Hawaiian pantheon, on whom was to be laid the burden of
a mongrel host of virtues and vices that were not assignable to the
regular orthodox deities. Somewhat in the same way do we use the name
Jack as a caption for a miscellaneous lot of functions, as when we speak
of a "Jack-at-all-trades."

<span id="fn_193"></span>[79:a](ulh14.htm#fr_196) *Wai oupe-kanaka*.
Man-fooling water; the mirage.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[79:b](ulh14.htm#fr_197) *Lima-loa*. The
long-armed, the god of the mirage, who made his appearance at Maná,
Kauai.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[79:c](ulh14.htm#fr_198) *Poloai*. To converse
with, to have dealings with one.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[79:d](ulh14.htm#fr_199) *Koolau-wahine*. The
sea-breeze at Mana. There is truth as well as poetry in the assertion
made in this verse. The warm moist air, rising from the heated sands of
Maná, did undoubtedly draw in the cool breeze from the ocean--a fruitful
dalliance.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[79:e](ulh14.htm#fr_200) *Kino-lau*. Having
many (400) bodies, or metamorphoses, said of Kawelo.

<span id="fn_198"></span>[79:f](ulh14.htm#fr_201) *Kawelo*. A sorcerer
who lived in the region of Maná. His favorite metamorphosis was into the
form of a shark. Even when in human form he retained the gills of a fish
and had the mouth of a shark at the back of his shoulders, while to the
lower part of his body were attached the tail and flukes of a shark. To
conceal these monstrous appendages he wore over his shoulders a *kihei*
of kapa and allowed himself to be seen only while in the sitting
posture. He sometimes took the form of a worm, a moth, a caterpillar, or
a butterfly to escape the hands of his enemies. On land he generally
appeared as a man squatting. after the manner of a Hawaiian gardener
while weeding his garden plot.

The cultivated lands of Kawelo lay alongside the much-traveled path to
the beach where the people of the neighborhood resorted to bathe, to
fish, and to swim in the ocean. He made a practice of saluting the
passers-by and of asking them, "Whither are you going?" adding the
caution, "Look to it that you are not swallowed head and tail by the
shark; he has not breakfasted yet " (*E akahele oukou o pau po’o, pau
hi’u i ka manó; aohe i paina i kakahiaka o ka manó)*. As soon as the
traveler had gone on his way to the ocean, Kawelo hastened to the sea
and there assumed his shark-form. The tender flesh of children was his
favorite food. The frequent utterance of the same caution, joined to the
great mortality among the children and youth who resorted to the ocean
at this place, caused a panic among the residents. The parents consulted
a soothsayer. who surprised them with the information that the guilty
one was none other than the innocent-looking farmer, Kawelo. Instructed
by the soothsayer, the people made an immense net of great strength and
having very fine meshes. This they spread in the ocean at the bathing
place. Kawelo, when caught in the net, struggled fiendishly to break
away, but in vain. According to directions, they flung the body of the
monster into an enormous oven which they had heated to redness, and
supplied with fresh fuel for five times ten days--*elima anahulu*. At
the end of that time there remained only gray ashes. The prophet had
commanded them that when this had been accomplished they must fill the
pit of the oven with dry dirt; thus doing, the monster would never come
to life. They neglected this precaution. A heavy rain flooded the
country--the superhuman work of the sorcerer--and from the moistened
ashes sprang into being a swarm of lesser sharks. From them have come
the many species of shark that now infest our ocean.

The house which once was Kawelo's ocean residence is still pointed out,
7 fathoms deep, a structure regularly built of rocks.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[79:g](ulh14.htm#fr_202) *Maha-maha i’a*. The
gills or fins of a fish such as marked Kawelo.

<span id="fn_200"></span>[80:a](ulh14.htm#fr_203) *Aona*. A word of
doubtful meaning; according to one it means lucky. That expounder
(T------ P------) says it should, or might be, *haona*; he instances the
phrase *iwi paoa*, in which the word *paoa* has a similar, but not
identical, form and means lucky bone.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[80:b](ulh14.htm#fr_204) *Ka-maile*. A place on
Kauai where prevailed the custom of throwing firebrands down the lofty
precipice of Nuololo. This amusement made a fine display at night. As
the fire-sticks fell they swayed and drifted in the breeze, making it
difficult for one standing below to premise their course through the air
and to catch one of them before it struck the ground or the water, that
being one of the objects of the sport. When a visitor had accomplished
this feat, he would sometimes mark his flesh with the burning stick that
he might show the brand to his sweetheart as a token of his fidelity,

<span id="fn_202"></span>[83:a](ulh14.htm#fr_205) In the original, *He
mau alualu ka ha’i e lawe*, literally "Some skins for another to take."

<span id="fn_203"></span>[83:b](ulh14.htm#fr_206) *Maka-léi*. (See note
*b*, [p. 17](ulh06.htm#page_17).)
