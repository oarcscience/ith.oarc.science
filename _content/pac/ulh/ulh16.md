# XII.--THE HULA PAHU

The hula *pahu* was so named from the *pahu*, <span
id="fr_239"></span>[a](#fn_235) or drum, that was its chief instrument
of musical accompaniment ([pl. X](#img_pl10)).

It is not often that the story of an institution can be so closely
fitted to the landmarks of history as in the case of this hula; and this
comes about through our knowledge of the history of the pahu itself.
Tradition, direct and reliable, informs us that the credit of
introducing the big drum belongs to La’a. This chief flourished between
five and six centuries ago, and from having spent most of his life in
the lands to the south, which the ancient Hawaiians called Kahiki, was
himself generally styled La’a-mai-Kahiki (La’a-from-Kahiki). The young
man was of a volatile disposition, given to pleasure, and it is evident
that the big drum he brought with him to Hawaii on one of his voyages
from Kahiki was in his eyes by no means the least important piece of
baggage that freighted his canoes. On nearing the land he waked the
echoes with the stirring tones of his drum, which so astonished the
people that they followed him from point to point along the coast and
heaped favors upon him whenever he came ashore.

La’a was an enthusiastic patron of the hula and is said to have made a
tour of the islands, in which he instructed the natives in new forms of
this seductive pastime, one of which was the hula *ka-eke*.

There is reason to believe, it seems, that the original use of the pahu
way in connection with the services of the temple, and that its
adaptation to the halau was simply a transference from one to another
religious use.

The hula pahu was preeminently a performance of formal and dignified
character, not such as would be extemporized for the amusement of an
irreverent company. Like all the formal hulas, it was tabu, by which the
Hawaiians meant that it was a religious service, or so closely
associated with the notion of worship as to make it an irreverence to
trifle with it. For this reason as well as for its intrinsic dignity its
performance was reserved for the most distinguished guests and the most
notable occasions.

Both classes of actors took part in the performance of the hula pahu,
the olapa contributing the mele as they stood and went through the
motions of the dance, while the hoopaa maintained the kneeling position
and operated the big drum with the left hand. While his left hand was
thus engaged, the musician with a thong held in his

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

right hand struck a tiny drum, the *pu-niu*, that was conveniently
strapped to the thigh of the same side. As its name signifies, the
pu-niu was made from coconut shell, being headed with fish-skin.

The harmonious and rhythmic timing of these two instruments called for
strict attention on the part of the performer. The pahu, having a tone
of lower pitch and greater volume than the other, was naturally sounded
at longer intervals, while the pu-niu delivered its, sharp crisp tones
in closer order.

Thou art Hilo, Hilo, flood-gate of heaven.  
Hilo has power to wring out the rain.  
Let Hilo turn here and turn there;  
Hilo's kept from employ, somber with rain;  
5 Pili-keko roars with full stream;  
The feathers of Hilo bristle with cold,  
And her hail-stones smite on the sand.  
She lies without motion, with upturned face,  
The fire-places pillowed with ashes;  
10 The bullets of rain are slapping the land,  
Pitiless rain turmoiling Pai-kaka.  
So, indeed.

In Puna was I, in Ku-ki’i, in Ha’e-ha’e,  
I saw a wraith of lehua, a burning bush,  
A fire-tree beneath the lava plate.  
Magnificent Puna, fertile from rain,  
5 At all times weaving its mantle.  
Aye Puna's a land of splendor,  
Proudly bedight with palm and lehua;  
Beauteous above, but horrid below,  
And miry the plain of Mau-kele.

*Song*

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Wai-aleale stands haughty and cold,  
Her lehua bloom, fog-soaked, droops pensive;  
The thorn-fringe set about swampy Ai-po is  
A feather that flaunts in spite of the pinching frost.  
5 Her herbage is pelted, stung by the rain;

Bruised all her petals, and moaning in cold  
Mokihana's sun, his wat’ry beams.  
I have acted in good faith and honor,  
My complaint is only to you--  
10 A matter that touches my life.

Best watch within and toward Ka-ula;  
Question each breeze, note every rumor,  
Even the whisper of Malua-kele.  
Search high and search low, unobservant.

15 There is life in the breath from her body,  
Fond caress by a hand not inconstant.  
Like fissured groves of coral  
Stand the ragged clumps of lehua.  
Many the houses, easy the life.

20 You have your portion--of love;  
Humanity smells at the door.  
Aye, indeed.

</div>

The imagery of this poem is peculiarly obscure and the meaning difficult
of translation. The allusions are so local and special that their
meaning does not carry to a distance.

Wai-aleale is the central mountain mass of Kauai, about 6,000 feet high.
Its summit, a cold, fog-swept wilderness of swamp and lake beset with
dwarfish growths of lehua, is used as the symbol of a woman, impulsively
kind, yet in turn passionate and disdainful. The physical attributes of
the mountain are ascribed to her, its spells of frosty coldness, its
gloom and distance, its fickleness of weather, the repellant hirsuteness
of the stunted vegetation that fringes the central swamp--these things
are described as symbols of her temper, character, and physical make-up.
The bloom and herbage of the wilderness, much pelted by the storm, are
figures to represent her physical charms. But spite of all these faults
and imperfections, a perennial fragrance, as of mokihana, clings to her
person, and she is the object of devoted love, capable of weaving the
spell of fascination about her victims.

This poem furnishes a good example of a peculiarity that often is an
obstacle to the understanding of Hawaiian poetry. It is the breaking up
of the composition into a number of parts that have but a loose seeming
connection the one with the other.

*pahu-hula*.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[105:a](ulh16.htm#fr_240) *Lehua makanoe*. The
lehua trees that grow on the top of Wai-aleale, the mountain mass of
Kauai, are of peculiar form, low, stunted, and so furzy as to be almost
thorny, *kuku*, as mentioned in the next line.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[105:b](ulh16.htm#fr_241) *Ai-po*. A swamp that
occupies the summit basin of the mountain, in and about which the thorny
lehua trees above mentioned stand as a fringe.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[105:c](ulh16.htm#fr_242) *Hau-a-iliki*. A word
made up of *hau*, dew or frost, and *iliki*, to smite. The a is merely a
connective.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[105:d](ulh16.htm#fr_243) *Mokihana*. The name
of a region on the flank of Wai-aleale, also a plant that grows there,
whose berry is fragrant and is used in making wreaths.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[105:e](ulh16.htm#fr_244) *Ka-ula*. A small
rocky island visible from Kauai.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[105:f](ulh16.htm#fr_245) *Malua-kele*. A wind.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[105:g](ulh16.htm#fr_246) *Halau*. The shed or
house which sheltered the canoe, *wa’a*, which latter, as we have seen,
was often used figuratively to mean the human body, especially the body
of a woman. *Kamau ke ea i ka halau* might be translated "persistent the
breath from her body." "There's kames o’ hinny ’tween my luve's lips."

<span id="fn_243"></span>[105:h](ulh16.htm#fr_247) *Wawae-noho*.
Literally the foot that abides; it is the name of a place. Here it is to
be understood as meaning constancy. It is an instance in which the
concrete stands for the abstract.

<span id="fn_244"></span>[105:i](ulh16.htm#fr_248) *Hauna*. An odor. In
this connection it means the odor that hangs about a human habitation.
The hidden allusion, it is needless to say, is to sexual attractiveness.
