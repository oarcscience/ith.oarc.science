### SACRIFICIAL STONES.

In the rear of some of the best-preserved platforms are stones said to
have been erected for sacrificial purposes. These altars consist of a
single shaft, generally of vesicular lava, but in some cases cut from
the material of which the images and crowns were, made. They range in
height from 5 to 10 feet, squared to 3½ or 4 feet on each face, and
stand in the center of a terrace paved with smooth bowlders. The sides
and plinth were covered with figures sculptured in low relief, but are
now too much weather-worn to be traced. These altars are said to have

been designed and used for human sacrifices, but of this a reasonable
doubt may be expressed. The form is inconveniently adapted to the
purpose and the stories differ in all respects from those used for the
same purpose in the other islands. Evidences of fire on top of stones
were plain enough, but no charred bones were found except those of
recent date belonging to sheep and cattle.
