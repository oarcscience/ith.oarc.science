# PART IV

### MICRONESIA

OF all the island-world of the Pacific the Micronesian area affords the
poorest store of myth material; not that the people of these islands
were relatively destitute of mythology, but because until very recently
practically no attempt had been made to gather and record it. Much of
the treasure which was once so abundant has now disappeared for ever,
and the blame for this loss lies here, more than elsewhere in the
Pacific, at the door of the early European visitors. In all the other
Oceanic regions they, or at least part of them, made some effort to
record what their civilization was destined to destroy, but here
scarcely a fragment was preserved. Racially the people of Micronesia
show at least two or perhaps three component elements. A Melanesian
factor is certain at least in some island-groups, although its relation
to the other factors varies widely, some islands showing a large mixture
of Melanesian blood, others but little. The non-Melanesian element in
the population presents some difficulty; it may be predominatingly
Indonesian or Malay, or a varying mixture of both, but in the present
state of our knowledge it would be premature to come to any definite
conclusions.
