# CHAPTER III

### SUMMARY

THE Micronesian myth material, as here outlined, clearly reveals its
relationships to Indonesia on the one hand, and to Polynesia on the
other. In the lack of detailed legends of creation Micronesia seems to
agree with what has been denominated as the Indonesian as opposed to the
Malayan myth type in Indonesia. In other particulars its similarities
are with the general Indonesian material, which, as has been pointed
out, is at present difficult to separate into its constituents, although
the absence of the trickster tales seems to argue little direct relation
with the definitely later Malay type. With Polynesia, the Micronesian
data show many features of resemblance, and these are wide-spread in the
whole Polynesian area. Melanesian similarities are far less striking,
and when they exist, seem to be with eastern Melanesia rather than with
New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago, though these are geographically
nearer. The eastern Melanesian mythology appears to show evidence of
greater Polynesian admixture or affinities and to be relatively of later
development than that of the West; and this would argue that the
Melanesian contact was historically late in Micronesia, however it may
have occurred. Of the supposedly Papuan type of mythology little or no
trace is found.
