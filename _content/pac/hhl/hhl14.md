# FIRST FOREIGNERS

IT IS said that the Chinese gave to the clove the name "Thengki"--"the
sweet-scented nail." When the clove came to Rome, the haughty lovers of
spices exclaimed "clavus"--"a nail." The English made a slight change
and said "clove." Solomon, the wise, and King Hiram, the Phoenician,
sent fleets on voyages of long duration. Their ships returned from these
voyages laden with the fragrant products of the spice lands.

Marco Polo rehearsed the abundant aromas of the Orient as well as the
gold and jewels and silks. Columbus, in 1492, went west that he might
find more ready access to these eastern riches. The spice islands lay
somewhere in a great ocean toward the sunset from Spain, provided the
world was round, as Columbus argued.

Balboa must have wished for a Nicaraguan or Panama Canal when he carried
timbers across the isthmus and built a ship on the Pacific coast to
explore the new ocean which he had discovered. In 1513 he launched his
little ship, intending to find the oriental riches, if possible.

In October of the year 1527, three Spanish ships were "fitted out" by
Cortez. They set sail from Zacatula, Mexico, for the Molucca Islands.
One only, under the command of Saavedra, reached its destination. A
fierce storm drove the little squadron far north of the ordinary route,
and swept two of the ships out of the record of history. Alexander says:
"It seems certain that a foreign vessel which was wrecked about this
time on the Kona coast of Hawaii must have been one of Saavedra's
missing ships." From this ship a white man and woman escaped. After
reaching the beach they knelt for a long time in prayer. The Hawaiians,
watching them, waited until they rose, and received welcome. The place
was at once named "Kulou"--"kneeling." Through all the succeeding years
the name kept the story of the wrecked white chiefs before the Hawaiian
people. The Hawaiians received their white visitors as honoured guests,
and permitted them to marry into noted chief-families. In the Hawaiian
legends the man and woman are called brother and sister. The man was
named Ku-kana-loa. Their descendants were well known, one of them being
a governor of the island of Kauai. These white citizens came to the
islands in the reign of Ke-alii-o-ka-loa, who was born about A. D. 1500,
and became a king of Hawaii about A. D. 1525.

There seems to be scarcely a trace of the Spanish language or of the
Christian religion as practiced

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

by the Spaniards. The nearest approach to any permanent influence
possibly coming from this shipwrecked man is the statement made to a
chief by a native prophet long before the islands were discovered by
Captain Cook, that from his predecessors he had learned the prophecy: "A
communication would be made to them from Heaven, the place of the real
God, entirely different from anything they had known and that the tabu
of the country would be subverted."

The Hawaiian traditions have several references to foreigners coming to
the islands. Pau-makau, of Oahu, was one of the Vikings of the Pacific
during the twelfth century. He is recorded as visiting many foreign
lands. He brought priests to Oahu. Judge Fornander suggests that quite
possibly these were Indians from the American coast. Professor
Alexander, in his "History of Hawaii," thinks there is scarcely
sufficient foundation for the suggestion. However, Pau-makau and his
journeys are accepted as part of Hawaiian history.

In the thirteenth century "the white chief with the iron knife" was
wrecked on the coast of the island of Maui, near the village Wailuku.
Three men and two women were saved. Wakalana, a chief, took his
outrigger canoe through the surf and rescued them. These persons are
supposed to have been Japanese. The captain of the ship carried a long
sword which became renowned throughout the islands as "the

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

wonderful iron knife." It was a tremendously effective weapon, when
matched with wooden daggers and war clubs. King Kalakaua relates the
amplified legend and chant in his "Myths and Legends of Hawaii," and in
imagination pictures some of the battles fought and trades made for the
possession of the iron knife. The Hawaiians came from all parts to see
these remarkable strangers. They were astonished to see the women eat
the same kinds of food, and from the same dishes as the men. "Nothing
was tabu to the strangers." This was entirely new to Hawaiian ideas.
Another legend mentions a foreign ship, called Ulupano, and the captain
was remembered as Malolano. It is supposed that the ship soon sailed
away. Other hints are found of ships having been seen out on the ocean
by fishing parties who had gone far from land. These ships were called
*moku* \[islands\], the name used to the present day.

There are undoubted proofs of the discovery of the Hawaiian Islands in
1555 by the Spaniard, Juan Gaetano. This is the first known record of
the islands among the civilised nations. There are evident references to
this group in the legends of the Polynesians in other Pacific islands.

Gaetano passed through the northern part of the Pacific and discovered
large islands which he marked upon a chart as "Los Majos." The great
mountains upon these islands did not rise in sharp peaks, but spread out
like a high tableland in the

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

clouds, hence he also called the islands "Isles de Mesa," the Mesa
Islands or the Table Lands. One of the islands was named "The
Unfortunate." Three other smaller islands were called "The Monks."

Le Perouse, the celebrated Frenchman who visited Hawaii in A. D. 1796,
says that Gaetano saw these islands "with their naked savages, cocoanuts
and other fruits, but no gold or silver." There was nothing attractive,
and the wealth-loving Spaniard marked the islands on his chart and never
visited them again. So the record lay for many years. This record, kept
in Spain's archives, is now accepted as marking the real discovery of
the Hawaiian Islands.

Meanwhile, the Hawaiians were as completely ignorant of the rest of the
world as if no civilised eyes had ever seen their mountains. They
offered each other as human sacrifices; they fought for supremacy. They
died at the will of their chiefs. They lived almost as lustfully as the
brutes. They had nothing that could be called a home, with an
affectionate household gathered inside its walls. They ate, and slept,
and died. They entered with zeal into the national sports as well as
into the national quarrels. They chanted their genealogies and personal
prowess. The art of sailing long distances by the aid of the stars had
fallen into disuse. The age of the Western Vikings had passed by. For
three or four hundred years no voyagers

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

had found their way to foreign lands. Then some time in the early part
of the eighteenth century a king of Oahu involuntarily made a journey
which was celebrated as a part of his genealogical chant. The entire
"mele," or song, stretches out to about six hundred lines. It is an
interesting poem filled with graphic references to people and places, to
winds and seas, and to birds and fishes.

In this chant the king of Oahu relates his strange experience on the
ocean. Fornander quotes the poem in his "Polynesian Race":

### CHANT OF KU-ALII (KU--THE CHIEF)

"O Kahiki, land of the far reaching ocean.  
Within is the land--outside is the sun,  
Indistinct are the sun and the land when approaching.  
    Perhaps you have seen it.  
    I have seen it.  
    I have surely seen Kahiki.

"A land with a strange language is Kahiki.  
The men of Kahiki have ascended  
The backbone of heaven (mountains)  
Up there they trample down,  
They look down on those below.  
Men of our race are not in Kahiki.  
One kind of men is in Kahiki--the white man.  
    He is like a god.  
    I am like a man,  
    A man, indeed.

"Wandering about, the only Hawaiian there.  
Days and nights passing by.  
By morsels was the food.  
Picking the food like a bird.  
    Listen, O bird of Victory!  
    Hush, with whom was the victory?  
        With Ku, indeed."

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

The chant states that the king was "wandering about," probably driven by
the winds far south from the islands. He and his oarsmen were almost
starving. The food became "morsels," or only enough for a bird to "pick
up." But Ku--the chief--won the victory over the ocean. He went to the
"foreign land." He found the white man's home, where the "land was
'within,'" *i.e.*, lying to the east, with the sun "outside," *i.e.*,
westward over the waters, most of the day. Perhaps the misty mountains
concealed the sun until the forenoon was far spent. He saw "the land of
the far-reaching ocean," and returned in safety to Oahu. "With Ku--the
chief--indeed was the victory."

Judge Fornander says: "It is probable that some Spanish galleons picked
up Ku and his companions, carried them to Acapulco, Mexico, and brought
them back on the return voyage."

In 1743, Lord Anson, of the British ship *Centurion*, captured a Spanish
ship near the Philippine Islands, and found a chart locating a group of
islands in the North Pacific--the same group that Gaetano discovered in
1555. This chart, and the story of Lord Anson's voyage, were almost
certainly known by Captain Cook, who made three voyages through the
Pacific.
