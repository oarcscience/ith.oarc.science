# CHAPTER V.

### THE MAORI CHIEF OF OLDEN TIME.

{Greek *Ðeòs d'w\`?s tíeto dh'mwj*}.-Homer.

THE Chiefs who came from Hawaiki to Aotea-roa in the canoe Arawa were
the following:--Tia, Maka, Oro, Ngatoroirangi, Maru-punganui, Ika,
Whaoa, Hei, and Tama-te-kapua. After their canoe was hauled ashore at
Maketu, these chiefs set out to explore the country, in order to take
possession of land each for himself and his family.

Tia and Maka went to Titiraupenga, at Taupo, and there remained.

Oro went to Taupo, and thence to Wanganui.

Ngatoroirangi went to Taupo, and died at Ruapehu.

Marupunga went to Rotorua, and died there.

Ika went to Wanganui, and died there.

Whaoa went to Paeroa.

Hei went to Whitianga (Mercury Bay). He was buried at O-a-Hei, on the
extremity of the promontory.

Tama-te-kapua went to Moehau (Cape Colville).

Waitaha, son of Hei, and Tapuika, son of Tia, and Tangihia, son of
Ngatoro-i-rangi, remained at Maketu. Tuhoro, and his younger brother,
Kahumata-momoe, sons of Tama-te-kapua, also remained at Maketu. Their
*Pa* was named Te Koari, and is still a sacred place. Their house was
named Whitingakongako. Kahu had a cultivation named Parawai, which his
mother gave him.

{p. 52}

While he was at work one day in his garden, Tuhoro struck him, and they
strove together. The elder brother fell, and being beneath his younger
brother was held down by him on the ground. Then their children and the
whole tribe cried out, "Let your elder brother rise up." So he let him
go; but their quarrel continued with angry words. "Some day I will be
the death of you," said Kahu, "and no one shall save you." Tuhoro,
enraged, again struck Kahu; but he was thrown to the ground a second
time by Kahu. Then Tuhoro seized hold of Kahu's ear, and tore from it a
green-stone; the name of this stone was *kaukaumatua*. Tuhoro kept it,
and some time afterwards buried it in the ground, at the foot of the
post by the window of their father's house.

After this Tuhoro resolved to follow his father, Tama-te-kapua. So he
went, he and all his children. He left none behind. He went to Moehau,
and there he and his father both died.

When Tama-te-kapua was on the point of dying, he said to his son,
Tuhoro, "You must remain sacred for three years, and dwell apart from
the tribe. Let there be three gardens by the sides of your house, set
apart as sacred, in which you are to cultivate food for the Alma. On the
fourth year awaken me from sleep; for my hands will be ever gathering up
the earth, and my mouth will be ever eating worms, and grubs, and
excrement, the only food below in the *Reinga* (abode of spirits). When
my *tuuta*<sup>\[1\]</sup> drops down, and my head falls down on my
body, and my hands drop down, and the fourth year

\[1. Point of junction of the spine and skull.\]

{p. 53}

arrives, turn my face to the light of day, and disinter my
*papa-toiake*.<sup>\[1\]</sup> When I arise you will be *noa* (free from
*tapu*.)

If clubs threaten to strike,  
You will see to it--Yes, yes.  
If a war party is abroad,  
You shall strike--Yes, yes."

Having thus said, Tama-te-kapua died, and was buried by his son on the
summit of Moehau.

The three years enjoined by Tama were not ended, when Tuhoro commenced
cultivating food as formerly; so the sacred remains of his father turned
against him, and he died.

A short time before his death, his sons, Taramainuku, Warenga, and
Huarere, assembled in his presence. Whereupon Tuhoro said, "Your younger
brother must bury me." So the younger son was called. Ihenga came and
sat beside his father in his sacred house, who thus instructed him:
"When I am dead, carry me out of the house, and lay me out naked to be
your *Ika-hurihuri*<sup>\[2\]</sup> (twisting fish). First bite with
your teeth my forehead, next bite with your teeth my
*tahito*<sup>\[3\]</sup> (perineum). Then carry me to the grave of your
grandfather. When I am buried, go to Maketu."

"Why must I go to Maketu?"

"That your uncle may perform the ceremonies to remove your sacredness."

\[1. Lower extremity of the spine.

2\. Omens were gathered from the movement of the dead body. The word
fish or canoe is often used symbolically for a man.

3\. The perineum and head are considered the most sacred parts of the
human body.\]

{p. 54}

"But how shall I know him?"

Then the father said, "He will not be unknown to you."

"Ho! some one will kill me on the way."

"Not so. You will go in safety along the sea-shore."

"But I shall never find him."

"You cannot mistake him. Look at his right ear for a part hanging down.
He is a big, short man, with a sleepy eye. When you approach your uncle,
in order that he may know you, go at once and seat yourself on his
pillow. When you are both freed from sacredness, search for the ear-drop
of your uncle under the window-post."

"But how shall I find it?"

"You will find it. Dig for it. It is buried there wrapt in a piece of
cloth with *manuka* bark outside it."

So, when the father died, his naked body was brought out of the house,
and laid on the ground. The younger son bit with his teeth the forehead,
and then bit with his teeth the *tahito* of his father, saying at the
same time, "Teach me when I sleep."

The reason why he bit the forehead and the *tahito* was that the *mana*,
or sacred power of his father, might inspire him, so that lie might
become his *tauira*, *i.e.*, the living representative of his *mana* and
*karakia*. Then the young man thus addressed the corpse: "If an enemy
attack us hereafter, show me whether death or safety will be ours. If
this land be abandoned, you and your father will be abandoned, and your
offspring will perish."

Then the corpse moved, and inclined towards the

{p. 55}

right side. Afterwards it inclined towards the left side. A second time
it inclined to the right, and afterwards to the left side. After that
the moving of the body ceased. Therefore it was seen that it was an
ill-omen, and that the land would be deserted.

After this laying out of the corpse, its legs were bent, so that the
knees touched the neck, and then it was bound in this position with a
plaited girdle. Afterwards two cloaks, made of *kahakaha*, were wrapt
around the corpse, over which were placed two cloaks such as old men
wear, and then a dog-skin cloak. Feathers of the albatross, the *huia*,
and the *kotuku* (white crane), were stuck in the hair of the head, and
the down breasts of the albatross were fastened to the cars. Then
commenced the *tangi* (dirge, or lament). Then the last farewell words
were spoken, and the chiefs made speeches. The lament of Rikiriki, and
the lament of Raukatauri for Tuhuruhuru was chanted; and the corpse was
buried on the ridge of Moehau.

Now, when the young man slept, the spirit of his father said to him,
"When you are hungry, do not allow your mouth to ask for food; but
strike with a stick the food-basket. If you are thirsty, strike the
gourd." Every night the spirit of the father taught the young man his
*karakia*, till he had learnt them all; after which he said to his son,
"Now we two will go, and also some one to carry food."

So they went both of them, the father's spirit leading the way. Starting
from Moehau they passed by Heretaonga, Whangapoua, Tairua, Whangamata,
Katikati, and Matakana. There they rested. After that they

{p. 56}

went on to Rangiwaea, where Ihenga embarked in a small sacred canoe,
while his travelling companion went on board a large canoe. Then they
crossed over to Waikoriri. Here Waitara wished to detain him, but he
would not stay. He went straight onwards to Wairakei, and the Houhou. He
met a man, and enquired where Kahu dwelt. The man said, "At the great
house you see yonder." So Ihenga went on, and having reached the place
where the Arawa was hauled ashore, he looked about him, and then went on
to the sacred place, the Koari, and there left his father's *ueta*\[1\].
He then ascended the cliff to the Teko, and climbing over Kahu's
doorway, went straight on to the sacred part of the courtyard, and
seated himself on Kahu's pillow.

Meanwhile Kahu was on the beach, where guests were usually entertained,
busied about sending off a canoe with food for the *Atua* at Hawaiki,
and for Houmaitahiti, food both cooked and uncooked. This canoe was made
of *raupo* (a species of bulrush), There was no one in the canoe, only
stones to represent men. There Kahu was busied sending off his canoe,
when his wife, Kuiwai, shouted to him, "Kahu, Kahu, there is a man on
your resting place." Then Kahu cried out, "Take him; shove him down
here." The woman replied, "Who will dare to approach your pillow; the
man is *tapu*." Then Kahu shouted, "Is he seated on my pillow?" "Yes."
"I am mad with anger," said Kahu; "his head shall pay for it."

Ihenga was dressed in two dog-skin cloaks, under

\[1. The *ueta* is a whisp of weeds or grass used to wipe the anus of
the corpse. it is afterwards bound to a stick, and is carried as a
talisman.\]

{p. 57}

which were two *kahakaha* cloaks. As Kahu went up towards the *Pa* he
asked, "Which way did the man come." The woman replied, "He climbed over
your gate."

By this time Kahu had reached the fence, and caught sight of the young
man.

He no sooner saw him than he recognised his likeness to his brother,
Tuhoro, and straightway welcomed him--"Oh! It is my nephew. Welcome, my
child, welcome." He then began lamenting, and murmuring words of
affection over him; so the tribe knew that it was the young son of
Tuhoro.

After the lament, Kahu made inquiry for his brother, and the young man
said, "My father is dead. I buried him. I have come to you to perform
the ceremonies of the *pure* and the *horohoro*, to remove my
sacredness." Immediately Kahu shouted to the tribe, "The *marae*
(courtyard) is *tapu*," and led the young man to the sacred house of the
priests. He then ordered food to be prepared--a dog of the breed of
Irawaru--and while it was being cooked, went with the young man to dip
themselves in the river. His companion, a son of his brother, Warenga,
remained with the rest of the tribe. When they had dipped in the river,
Kahu commenced cutting the young man's hair, which is a part of the
ceremony of *Pure*. In the evening, the hair being cut, the
*mauri*,<sup>\[1\]</sup> or sacredness of the hair, was fastened to a
stone.

\[1. The hair of the head, in this ceremony, was made fast to a stone,
and the sacredness of the hair was supposed to be transferred to this
stone, which represented some ancestor. The stone and hair were then
carried to the sacred place belonging to the *Pa*.\]

{p. 58}

Then Kahu went with Ihenga to the Koari, where the *ueta* of the corpse
had been left, and there chanted a *karakia*. They then rested for the
night.

The next morning the ceremony of the *Pure* was finished, and the
following *karakia* was chanted by Kahu:--

Complete the rite of Pure,  
By which you will be free from  
The evil influence of Po,  
The bewitching power of Po.  
Free the canoe from sacredness, O Rangi  
The canoe of stumbling unawares, O Rangi  
The canoe of death unawares, O Rangi.  
Darkness for the Tipua, darkness.  
Darkness for the Antient-one, darkness.  
Some light above,  
Some light below.  
Light for the Tipua, light.  
Light for the Antient-one, light.  
The *uwha*<sup>\[1\]</sup> is held aloft.  
A squeeze, a squeeze.  
Protection from Tu.

After this they went to partake of food; and the oven of the
*kohukohu*<sup>\[2\]</sup> was opened. While the oven was being
uncovered by Hine-te-kakara (the fragrant damsel), she took care to turn
aside her face, lest the savour of the *kumara* and the steam of the
sacred oven should come near her mouth, lest evil should come to her.
She did not even swallow her spittle, but constantly kept spitting it
forth.

\[1. *Uwha*, the bivalve shell used for cutting the hair.

2\. *Kohukohu*, the plant chick-weed, in the leaves of which the sacred
*kumara* was wrapped.\]

{p. 59}

When the food was set before Kahu and Ihenga, Ihenga took up some of the
*kohukohu* in which were wrapt two *kumara*, and held it in his hand,
while Kahu chanted the following *karakia*:--

Rangi, great Rangi,  
Long Rangi, dark Rangi,  
Darkling Rangi, white-star Rangi,  
Rangi shrouded in night.  
Tane the first, Tane the second,  
Tane the third, &c.  
(Repeated to Tane the tenth).  
Tiki, Tiki of the mound of earth,  
Tiki gathered in the hands,  
To form hands and legs,  
And the fashion of a man,  
Whence came living men.  
Toi,  
Rauru,  
Whetima,  
Whetango,  
Te Atua-hae,  
Toi-te-huatahi,  
Tuamatua,  
Houmaitahiti,  
Ngatoroirangi,  
And your first born male  
Now living in the light of day.

While Kahu chanted thus, the *kohukohu* was held in the hand of Ihenga.
Kahu then proceeded with the direct male line--

Tangihia,  
Tangimoana,  
Tumakoka,  
Tukahukura,  
Tuhoto,  
Tarawhai.

{p. 60}

There ended the recitation of Kahu, and he went on to his own proper
line-

Houmaitahiti,  
Tama,  
Tuhoro,  
And to your offspring born to life,  
And to the light of day.  
This is your *kohukohu* of the *horohoronga*,  
To make light the weight of *tapu*.  
He is free, he is released from *tapu*.  
He goes safely where food is cooked,  
To the evil mighty spirits of Night,  
To the kind mighty spirits of Night,  
To the evil mighty spirits of Light,  
To the kind mighty spirits of Light.

Then the *kohukohu* was offered as food to the stone images, and was
divided for Houmaitahiti, for Ngatoroirangi, for Tama-te-kapua, and for
Tuhoro, and was pressed into their mouths<sup>\[1\]</sup>. This being
done Ihenga took up another *kohukohu*, and held it in his hand raising
it aloft, while Kahu chanted the following *karakia*:--

For Hine-nui-te-po,  
For Whati-uri-mata-kaka,  
For the evil old women of Night,  
For the kind old women of Night,  
For the evil old women of Day,  
For the kind old women of Day,  
For Kearoa,  
Whose offspring is born to life,

\[1. Hence the term *horohoronga* (= swallowing) given to the ceremony.
It is to be remarked that the distinguishing name given to various
ceremonies was taken from some striking circumstances connected with
it,--thus, a sacred oven is named *kohukohu* from the leaves of the
plant in which the *kumara* was wrapt: &c.\]

{p. 61}

And to the bright light of day,  
This *kohukohu* is offered for you,  
The *kohukoku* {*sic*} of the *Ruahine*.  
He is free, he is no longer *tapu*.

The female *Atua* were then fed with the *kohukohu* as in the former
case. Then part of the *kohukohu* was offered for the mother,
Whaka-oti-rangi.

\[1\]

Turn away Night,  
Come Day.  
This is the *kohukoku* of freedom,  
And deliverance from *tapu*.

This done, Ihenga took up another kohukohu, and held it aloft in his
hand, while Kahu chanted thus:--

Close up Night, close up Day,  
Close up Night as the soft south wind.  
The *tapu* of the food  
And the *mana* of the food,  
The food with which you are fed,  
The food of Kutikuti,  
The food of Pekapeka,  
The food of Haua-te-rangi.  
I eat, Uenuku eats.  
I eat, Kahukura eats.  
I eat, Rongomai eats.  
I eat, Ihungaro eats.  
I eat, Itupaoa eats.  
I eat, Hangaroa eats.  
I eat, Ngatoro-irangi eats.  
I eat, Tama eats.

\[1. Kearoa and Whaka-oti-rangi being both sacred female
ancestors--wives of Ngatoro and Tama, represented the *Ruahine*, the
swallowing of this food by whom was requisite in removing the *tapu*.
The *tapu*, or sacredness of Kahu, was supposed to be transferred to the
*kohukohu*, and when this was eat by the ancestral spirits, the *tapu*
was deposited with them.\]

{p. 62}

This ended, Kahu proceeded thus:

If I fall from the precipice,  
Let me not be harmed.  
If I fall on the *taramoa*,  
Let me not be scratched.  
If I eat of the *maihi*<sup>\[1\]</sup> of *tohunga's* house,  
Let me not be harmed.  
Be thou undermost,  
While I am uppermost.  
Give me your *mana* to strike down.  
Close tight your spirit-devouring teeth.  
Close tight your man-devouring teeth.

Then Kahu spat on the *kohukohu*, breathed on it, and offered it to
Tama, that is to say, to the image of Tama-te-kapua. Kahu and Ihenga
then ate the food cooked for them in the sacred oven. Ihenga ate with a
fork, while at the same time he fed Kahu with his left hand.

The same ceremonies were observed at the evening meal.

Eight days after the ceremony of *Pure*, the heart of Ihenga conceived a
desire. He was taken with the fair face of Hinetekakara; so he asked
Kahu, "When shall we two be free from *tapu*?" Kahu replied "We two will
not soon be free." "Oh! be quick," said Ihenga, "that I may return to my
elder brothers, to my mother, and to my sisters." Kahu said, "You will
not be dismissed soon-not until the *tapu* is completely removed from
you." "How many nights, then, after this?"

\[1. *Maihi* are the two boards placed at an angle at front gable of a
house. If the wood of a sacred house were to be accidentally used as
firewood for cooking purposes, anyone who ate the food thus cooked would
be guilty of a crime, to be punished by the *Atua* with disease or
death.\]

{p. 63}

Kahu answered, "Twenty nights."

"Ho! what a very long time," said Ihenga, "for our *tapu*."

The remonstrance of the young man here ended; but not long afterwards he
persisted in the same manner. Thereupon Kahu began to consider--"Ha!
what is it my nephew persists about?" So he asked, "Why are you in so
great a hurry to be free from *tapu*?" Then the young man spoke out,
"Whose daughter is the maiden who cooks our food?"

"Mine," replied Kahu.

"My fear," said Ihenga, "lest some one may have her."

"I thought there must be something."

"Do not let some other man have her."

"Your cousin shall be your wife," said Kahu, calling the damsel: "Come
here, girl, near the door."

The girl came laughing, for she knew she was to be given to Ihenga.

Then said Kahu: "Your cousin has a longing for you."

"It is well," replied the damsel.

"Oh! my children," murmured Kahu. He then cautioned his daughter not to
enter the house where young people resort for amusement.

"I never go to the play-house," replied Hinetekakara, "I always sleep
with my mother in our own house,"

"You do well," said Kahu; "in twenty days we shall both be free from our
*tapu*."

So they both continued to dwell in their sacred house by themselves, and
the damsel always cooked food for

{p. 64}

them; and when the day fixed by Kahu came he sent Ihenga, in a canoe to
catch fish to complete the ceremony of removing the *tapu*. The fish
were caught, and two ovens were prepared to cook them--a sacred oven for
the *tohunga*, or seers skilled in sacred lore--and a free oven for the
*tauira*, or those being instructed in sacred lore. And when the food
was cooked they assembled to eat it: the *tohunga* on the right hand fed
each other by hand, and the *tauira* on the left ate freely their
unsacred food. This was done to lighten the weight of the *tapu*, in
order that they might be free. When all this was done, and they were no
longer *tapu*, Hinetekakara became the wife of Ihenga.

The following morning Ihenga searched for the greenstone *kaukaumatua*,
and found it in the place where Tuhoro had buried it. He then fastened
it to the ear of Hinetekakara, bidding her go and show the treasure to
her father. When Kahu beheld his lost treasure hanging from his
daughter's ear he gave utterance to his feelings with tears and words of
affection for his dead brother, and when the *tangi* or lament was
ended, bid her keep the treasure for herself, and for her cousin.

Some time afterwards Hinetekakara conceived, and Ihenga went to catch
*kiwi* for her *turakanga*.\[1\] He took with him his dog Potakatahiti,
one of the same breed as the dog of the same name which was devoured by
Toi and Uenuku.<sup>\[2\]</sup> Crossing the swamp Kawa, he went to

\[1. *Turakanga* (= throwing down) was a ceremony in which a stick set
up to represent the path of death was thrown down. A form of *karakia*
was, at the same time, used.

2\. Vid: Sir G. Grey's "Mythology and Traditions," p. 63.\]

{p. 65} Papanui, and arriving at the cross-road at Waipumuka ascended
the hill Paretawa. Thence he went on to Hakomiti, and Pukerangiora, and
began to hunt *kiwi*. The dog feeling the heat, and becoming thirsty,
went off in search of water, at the same time hunting *kiwi*. When he
caught a *kiwi* he left it on the ground. At last a *kiwi* ran a long
way, and tried to escape by running into a lake where the dog caught it.
The dog then began to catch in its mouth the small fish called *inanga*;
and having filled its belly returned by the way it had come, always
picking up the *kiwi*, which it had left on the ground, and carrying
them in his mouth, till he reached his master, laid them on the ground
before him. Seeing the dog dripping with water, Ihenga said to his
companions, "Ho! the dog has found water. There is a lake below,
perhaps." However they did not then go to look for it, for they were
busied about cooking food. Meanwhile the dog began to roll on the ground
in front of Ihenga, belly upwards. It then lay down, but not long after
began to vomit, and the *inanga* were seen lying on the ground. Then
they went to look for the water, and the dog ran before them barking
every now and then to let his master know which way he was going. In
this way they soon came to the lake. Shoals of *inanga* were leaping on
the water; so they made a net with branches of fern, and having caught a
great many, cooked some for food; after which they returned to Maketu,
carrying with them basketsful of *inanga* to show to Kahu, that he might
know how the lake abounded with food. Ihenga named the lake "Te
Roto-iti-kite-a-Ihenga" (= the small lake discovered by Ihenga), thus
claiming it as a possession for his children.

{p. 66}

When they reached Maketu Ihenga told Kahu about the lake he had
discovered.

"Where is it?" inquired Kahu.

"Beyond the hills."

"Is it a long way off?"

"Yes," said Ihenga.

"Beyond the first range of hills?" inquired Kahu.

"At the sixth range of hills," said Ihenga.

"Oh! it is near," said Kahu.

Then Ihenga bid his companions show Kahu the food they had brought.

But Kahu said, "No; leave it alone till to-morrow."

The next morning the oven was made ready for the ceremony of Turakanga.
Hinetekakara dipped in the river, and two mounds of earth were made-one
for a male child, and one for a female child. The path of death was
thrown down, and the path of life set up. Then the woman trampled on the
mound for the male child with one foot, and with the other foot she
trampled on the mound for the female child. Then she ran and plunged in
the river, and when she rose to the surface she swam ashore, put on her
*tawaru*, and returned to her house.

When the food was cooked all the men assembled to eat it-the men of the
race of Houmaitahiti. There were six hundred *kiwi*, and two baskets of
*inanga*. And as he was eating Kahu murmured, "Ho! ho! what prime food
for my grandchild."

{p. 67}

After some time a child was born and was named Tama-ihu-toroa, and when
it grew strong in limb, so that it could turn about from one side to the
other, Kahu said to Ihenga, "Go, seek lands for your child."
