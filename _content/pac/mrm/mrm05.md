# CHAPTER III.

### RELIGIOUS RITES OF THE MAORI.

{Greek *All? á?ge dh\` tina mántin e?reíomen*.}-Hom. Il. 1-62.

THE religious rites and ceremonies of the *Maori* were strange and
complex, and must have been a severe burden, as will be understood from
the translations of *Maori* narratives relating to such matters
contained in these pages. To make these translations more intelligible
to the reader, a brief review of the subject is now given in
explanation.

The religious rites under consideration are immediately connected with
certain laws relating to things *tapu*, or things sacred and prohibited,
the breach of which laws by anyone is a crime displeasing to the *Atua*
of his family. Anything *tapu* must not be allowed to come in contact
with any vessel or place where food is kept. This law is absolute.
Should such contact take place, the food, the vessel, or place, become
*tapu*, and only a few very sacred persons, themselves *tapu*, dare to
touch these things.

The idea in which this law originated appears to have been that a
portion of the sacred essence of an *Atua*, or of a sacred person, was
directly communicable to objects which they touched, and also that the
sacredness so communicated to any object could afterwards be more or
less retransmitted to anything else brought into contact with it. It was
therefore necessary that anything containing the sacred essence of an
*Atua* should be made *tapu* to protect it from being polluted by the

{p. 26}

contact of food designed to be cat; for the act of eating food which had
touched anything *tapu*, involved the necessity of eating the sacredness
of the *Atua*, from whom it derived its sacredness.

It seems that the practice of cannibalism must have had a close
connexion with such a system of belief. To eat an enemy was the greatest
degradation to which he could be subjected, and so it must have been
regarded as akin to blasphemy to eat anything containing a particle of
divine essence.

Everything not included under the class *tapu* was called noa, meaning
free or common. Things and persons *tapu* could, however, be made *noa*
by means of certain ceremonies, the object of which was to extract the
*tapu* essence, and restore it to the source whence it originally came.
It has been already stated that every tribe and every family has its own
especial *Atua*. The *Ariki*, or head of a family, in both male and
female lines, are regarded by their own family with a veneration almost
equal to that of their *Atua*.<sup>\[1\]</sup> They form, as

\[1. It is observable that Homer attributes special honor to a few of
his heroes, who appear to have been the male representatives of their
race,--as to Agamemnon of the race of Pelops, and to Aeneas of the race
of Assaracus. With respect to each of them, it is mentioned that he was
honored as a God by his people. "{Greek *Ðeòs d? w!\`s tíeto dh'mwj*}."
Among the Maori these chiefs would have been distinguished by the title
of Ariki. Homer gives them the title "{Greek *á?naks a?ndrw\~n*}," the
old meaning of which words has been a matter of much inquiry. Mr
Gladstone (Homer and Homeric Age, vol. I. p. 456) says, "It seems to me
that this restraint in the use of the name '{Greek *á?naks a?ndrw\~n*}'
was not unconnected with a sense of reverence towards it;" and he
suggests the word chieftain as its fit representative. Might not its
original meaning have been similar to that of *Ariki*?\]

{p. 27}

it were, the connecting links, between the living and the spirits of the
dead; and the ceremonies required for releasing anything from the *tapu*
state cannot be perfected without their intervention.

On arriving one evening at a *Maori* settlement, I found that a
ceremony, in which everyone appeared to take deep interest, was to take
place in the morning. The inhabitants were mostly professing Christians,
and the old sacred place of the settlement was, from the increase of
their numbers, inconveniently near their houses; a part of it was,
therefore, required to be added to the *Pa*. I was curious to see in
what way the land required would be made *noa*. In the morning when I
went to the place I found a numerous assembly, while in the centre of
the space was a large native oven, from which women were removing the
earth and mat-coverings. When opened it was seen to contain only
*kumara*, or sweet potato. One of these was offered to each person
present, which was held in the hand while the usual morning service was
read, concluding with a short prayer that God's blessing might rest on
the place. After this each person ate his *kumara*, and the place was
declared to be *noa*. I could not but think that the native teacher had
done wisely in thus adopting so much of old ceremonial as to satisfy the
scruples of those of little faith. In this case, every one present, by
eating food cooked on the *tapu* ground, equally incurred the risk of
offending the *Atua* of the family, which risk was believed to be
removed by the Christian *karakia*.

By neglecting the laws of *tapu*, *Ariki*, chiefs, and

{p. 28}

other sacred persons are especially liable to the displeasure of their
*Atua*, and are therefore afraid to do a great many ordinary acts
necessary in private life. For this reason a person of the sacred class
was obliged to eat his meals in the open air, at a little distance from
his sacred dwelling, and from the place which he and his friends usually
occupied; and if he could not eat all that had been placed before him he
kept the remainder for his own sole use, in a sacred place appropriated
for that purpose: for no one dared to eat what so sacred a person had
touched.

The term *karakia* is applicable to all forms of prayer to the *Atua*:
but there are a variety of names or titles to denote *karakia* having
special objects. The translations of those now presented to the reader
will, it is believed, speak for themselves as to the nature of *Maori*
worship, and carry with them a more clear and full conviction as to what
it really was than any mere statements however faithful. It will be seen
that a *karakia* is in some cases very like a prayer,--in other cases
for the most part an invocation of spirits of ancestors in genealogical
order,--in other cases a combination of prayer and invocation.

### THE KARAKIA OF HINETEIWAIWA.

Said to have been used at the birth of her son Tuhuruhuru. It is of
great antiquity, dating from a time long anterior to the migration to
New Zealand.

Weave, weave the mat,  
Couch for my unborn child,  
Qui lectus aquâ inundabitur:  
Rupe, et manumea inundabuntur:  
Lectus meus, et mei fetûs inundabitur: {p. 29}  
Inundabor aquâ, inundabor;  
Maritus meus inundabitur.<sup>\[1\]</sup>  
Now I step upon (the mat).  
The *Matitikura*<sup>\[2\]</sup> to Rupe above,  
  \*  \*  \*  Toroa  \*  
  \*  \*  \*  Takapu \*  
  \*  \*  \*  to cause to be born,  
My child now one with myself.  
Stand firm *turuturu*<sup>\[3\]</sup> of Hine-rauwharangi,  
  \*  \*  \*  Hine-teiwaiwa,  
Stand by your *tia*,<sup>\[4\]</sup> Ihuwareware,  
Stand by your *kona*,<sup>\[5\]</sup> Ihuatamai,  
Chide me not in my trouble,  
Me Hine-teiwaiwa, O Rupe.<sup>\[6\]</sup>  
Release from above your hair<sup>\[7\]</sup>  
Your head, your shoulders,  
Your breast, your liver,  
Your knees, your feet,  
Let them come forth.  
The old lady<sup>\[8\]</sup> with night-dark visage,  
She will make you stretch,  
She will make you rise up.  
Let go *ewe*,<sup>\[9\]</sup> let go take,<sup>\[10\]</sup>  
Let go *parapara*.<sup>\[11\]</sup> Come forth.

\[1. Hæc ad effusionem aquarum sub tempus partûs spectant.

2\. The name of a powerful *karakia*.

3\. *Turuturu*, a sharp pointed prop, two of which are fixed in the
floor to serve as a frame for weaving mats--also used by women in
child-birth to hold by.

4\. 5. Names of lower parts of abdomen.

6\. Rupe or Maui-mua, brother-in-law of Hine-teiwaiwa.

7\. Addressed to the unborn child.

8\. The old lady referred to was Hine-nui-te-po, the mother of the
female ancestress of mankind.

9\. 10. 11. Names of different parts of the decidua.

For tradition as to Tuhuruhuru and other names here mentioned vid. Sir
Geo. Grey's "Mythology and Traditions of New Zealand," p. 39 et seq.\]

{p. 30}

This *karakia* is still in use with the Arawa tribe in cases of
difficult parturition. When such cases occur, it is concluded that the
woman has committed some fault--some breach of the *tapu*, which is to
be discovered by the *matakite* (= seer). The father of the child then
plunges in the river, while the *karakia* is being repeated, and the
child will generally be born ere ever he returns.

The following form of *karakia* is also used by members of the same
tribe in similar cases:--

O! Hine-teiwaiwa, release Tuhuruhuru,  
O! Rupe, release your nephew.

The ancestors of the father of the child are then invoked by name. First
the elder male line of ancestors, commencing with an ancestor who lived
in Hawaiki and terminating with the living representative of that line.
Then follows a repetition of the ancestral line next in succession, and
the third in succession, if the child be not born.<sup>\[1\]</sup> After
which the *tohunga* addressing the unborn child says, "Come forth. The
fault rests with me. Come forth." The *tohunga* continues thus--

Unravel the tangle, unravel the crime,  
Untie *manuka*, let it be loosed.  
Distant though Rangi,  
He is reached.

If the child be not now born, Tiki is invoked thus--

Tiki of the heap of earth,  
Tiki scraped together,  
When hands and feet were formed,  
First produced at Hawaiki.

\[1. In the *Maori* MS., of which the above is a translation, the names
of the ancestors of the chief of the tribe referred to are given in
genealogical order, but are omitted here.\]

{p. 31}

If the child be a male, it will be born--if a female, the mother's line
of ancestors must be invoked.

Intimately connected with the superstition respecting things *tapu* is
the belief as to the cause of disease, namely, that a spirit has taken
possession of the body of the sufferer. The belief is that any neglect
of the law of *tapu*, either wilful, or accidental, or even brought
about by the act of another person, causes the anger of the *Atua* of
the family who punishes the offender by sending some infant spirit to
feed on a part of his body--infant spirits being generally selected for
this office on account of their love of mischief, and because not having
lived long enough on earth to form attachments to their living
relatives, they are less likely to show them mercy. When, therefore, a
person falls sick, and cannot remember that he has himself broken any
law of the *tapu*, he has to consult a *matakite* (seer) and a *tohunga*
to discover the crime, and use the proper ceremonies to appease the
*Atua*; for there is in practice a method of making a person offend
against the laws of *tapu* without his being aware of it. This method is
a secret one called *makutu*. It is sufficient for a person who knows
this art, if he can obtain a portion of the spittle of his enemy, or
some leavings from his food, in order that he may treat it in a manner
sure to bring down the resentment of his family *Atua*. For this reason
a person would not dare to spit when in the presence of anyone he feared
might be disposed to injure him, if he had a reputation for skill in
this evil art.

With such a belief as to the cause of all disease it will not be
wondered at that the treatment of it was

{p. 32}

confined to the *karakia* of a *tohunga* or wise man. One or two
examples of such cases will be sufficient to explain this as well as to
show the in-rooted superstition of the *Maori*.

When anyone becomes *porangi* or insane, as not unfrequently happens, he
is taken to a *tohunga*, who first makes an examination as to the cause
of the disease. He and the sick man then go to the waterside, and the
*tohunga*, stripping off his own clothes, takes in his hand an obsidian
flint. First he cuts a lock of hair from the left side of the sick man's
head, and afterwards a lock of hair from the top of his head. The
obsidian flint is then placed on the ground, and upon it the lock of
hair which had been cut from the left side of the head. The lock of hair
cut from the top of the head is held aloft in the left hand of the
*tohunga*, while in his right hand he holds a common stone, which is
also raised aloft, while the following *karakia* is being repeated by
him.

Tu, divide, Tu, split,  
This is the *waiapu* flint,  
Now about to cry aloud  
To the Moon of ill-omen.

Then the *tohunga* breathes on the flint, and smashes it with the stone
held in his right hand. After this he selects a shoot of the plant
*toetoe*, and pulls it up, and then fastens to it both the locks of
hair. Then diving in the river, he lets go the *toetoe* and locks of
hair, and when they float on the surface of the water, he commences his
great *karakia* thus--

This is the *Tiri* of Tu-i-rawea,  
This is the *Tiri* of Uenuku. {p. 33}  
Where lies your fault ?  
Was eating a *kutu* your fault?  
Was sitting on *tapu* ground your fault?  
Unravel the tangle,  
Unravel, untie.  
Take away the fault from the head  
Of the *Atua* who afflicts this man.  
Take away the disease,  
And the *mana* of the curser.  
Turn your *mana* against your *tohunga*,  
And your *whaiwhaia*.<sup>\[1\]</sup>  
Give me the curse  
To make as cooked food.  
Your *Atua* desecrated,  
Your *tapu*, your curse,  
Your sacred -place-dwelling *Atua*,  
Your house-dwelling *Atua*,  
Give me to cook for food.  
Your *tapu* is desecrated by me.  
The rays of the sun,  
The brave of the world,  
The *mana*, give me.  
Let your *Atua*, and your *tapu*  
Be food for me to eat.  
Let the head of the curser  
Be baked in the oven,  
Served up for food for me  
Dead, and gone to Night.

The latter part of this *karakia* is a curse directed against some
*tohunga* supposed to have caused the disease by his art of *makutu*.

Nahutu was the weapon of the weak, who had no other mode of obtaining
redress. There is no doubt but that it exercised a restraining
influence, in a

\[1. A *karakia* so called.\]

{p. 34}

society where no law but that of force generally prevailed, as a check
to theft and unjust dealing generally; for there is among the *Maori* a
firm belief in and dread of its power. This is very evident from the
following account given by one of themselves of the mode employed to
detect and punish a petty theft.

A woman is much vexed when any of the flax scraped by her is stolen, and
she consults a *tohunga*, in order to discover the thief. Whether the
flax has been stolen from her house or from the water, the woman's house
must be *tapu*. No one must be allowed to enter it. This is necessary,
that the *makutu* may take effect, and the person who stole the flax be
discovered. So when the woman comes to the *tohunga* he first asks her
"Has any one entered your house?" She replies "No." Then the *tohunga*
bids her return home, saying "I will come to you at night." The woman
returns home, and at night the *tohunga* comes to her. He bids her point
out her house, and then goes with her to the water side. Having taken
off his clothes, he strikes the water with a stick or wand, brought with
him for that purpose, and immediately the form of the thief stands
before them. The *tohunga* thus curses it--

May your eyes look at the moon  
Eyes of flax be yours,  
Hands of flax be yours,  
Feet of flax be yours.  
Let your hands snatch  
At the rays of the Sun.  
Let your hands snatch at Whiro,  
Whiro in vast heaven, {p. 35}  
Whiro born of Papa.  
Snatch, snatch at your own head,  
Perishing in the Night of Darkness,  
In the Night of Death--Death.

### WHAKAHOKITU

Is the name given to forms of *makutu* employed to counteract the curse
of some other *tohunga*, or wise-man; for whoever practises *makutu*,
even though he be skilled in the art, may have to yield to the *mana* of
some other wise-man who can command the assistance of a more powerful
*Atua*. The following is a specimen of this kind of *makutu*--

Great curse, long curse,  
Great curse, binding curse,  
Binding your sacredness  
To the tide of destruction.  
Come hither, sacred spell,  
To be looked on by me.  
Cause the curser to lie low  
In gloomy Night, in dark Night,  
In the Night of ill-omen.  
Great wind, lasting wind,  
Changing wind of *Rangi* above.  
He falls. He perishes.  
Cause to waste away the curser *tohunga*.  
Let him bite the oven-stones.  
Be food for me,  
The *tapu* and the *mana*,  
Of your *Atua*,  
Of your *karakia*,  
Of your *tohunga*.

Among the *Atua* much held in awe by the Maori were the *Atua*
*noho-whare*, or house-dwelling gods--spirits of the germs of unborn
infants. They are also known by

{p. 36}

the name *kahukahu*, the meaning of which word was explained in a former
publication.

The *Maori* has also a firm belief in omens derived from dreams, and
from any sudden movements of the body or limbs during sleep, all which
signs are believed to be warnings from the *Atua*.

There is a class of dreams called *moe-papa*, which are very unlucky:
and if any one has one of these dreams, he will avoid going on a
projected journey; for it is firmly believed that should he persist in
going he will fall into an enemy's ambush, or meet with some other
misfortune. Hence the proverbial remark, if a person has neglected such
a warning, and has fallen in with a war-party, "He was warned by a
*moe-papa*, and yet went." The kind of sleep denoted by this word is
described to be the climbing a precipice, the wandering astray in a
forest, entering a house, climbing a tree. Such dreams are death
warnings. They appear to be such as we term night-mare.

The startings of the limbs or body during sleep are called *takiri*,
some of which are lucky, and some unlucky, each kind being distinguished
by a special name.

The lucky *takiri* are--

The *hokai*, or starting of the leg or foot in a forward direction. It
denotes the repulse of the enemy.

The *tauaro*, or starting of the arm towards the body.

The *whakaara*, when in sleep the head starts upwards. It signifies that
ere long the *Ariki* or his father will arrive.

The *kapo*, a very lucky sign. While a man sleeps with

{p. 37}

his right arm for a pillow, if the arm starts so as to strike his head,
on awaking he will not mention it to his companions; for he knows by
this omen that in the next battle which takes place it will be his good
fortune to kill the first man of the enemy.

The unlucky *takiri* are--

The *kohera*, a starting of the arm and leg of one side of the body in
an outward direction.

The *peke*, a starting of the arm outwards from the body.

The *whawhati*, a sleep in which the legs, the neck, and the head are
bent doubled up towards the belly. This is very unlucky. The evil will
not come to another person, but attends the man himself.

The former *takiri* do not necessarily denote evil to the individual
sleeper, but to any of his companions.
