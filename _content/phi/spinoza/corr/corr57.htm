<p>[<i>A continuation of the arguments in favour of ghosts, which may be summarized as follows:&#151;I say a thing is done by chance, when it has not been the subject of will on the part of the doer; not when it might never have happened.&#151;Necessity and freedom, not necessity and chance, are contraries.&#151;If we do not in some sense attribute human qualities to God, what meaning can we attach to the term?&#151;You ask for absolute proof of the existence of spirits; such proof is not obtainable for many things, which are yet firmly believed.&#151;Some things are more beautiful intrinsically than others.&#151;As God is a spirit, spirits resemble Him more than embodied creatures do.&#151;A ghost cannot be conceived as clearly as a triangle: can you say that your own idea of God is as clear as your idea of a triangle?&#151;As a circle exists without a sphere, so a sphere exists without a circle.&#151;We call things higher or lower in proportion to their distance from the earth.&#151;All the Stoics, Pythagoreans, and Platonists, Empedocles, Maximus Tyrius, Apuleius, and others, bear witness to ghosts; and no modern denies them</i>.</p>
