### LETTER LIX. (LV.)

#### HUGO BOXEL TO SPINOZA.

\[*A continuation of the arguments in favour of ghosts, which may be
summarized as follows:—I say a thing is done by chance, when it has not
been the subject of will on the part of the doer; not when it might
never have happened.—Necessity and freedom, not necessity and chance,
are contraries.—If we do not in some sense attribute human qualities to
God, what meaning can we attach to the term?—You ask for absolute proof
of the existence of spirits; such proof is not obtainable for many
things, which are yet firmly believed.—Some things are more beautiful
intrinsically than others.—As God is a spirit, spirits resemble Him more
than embodied creatures do.—A ghost cannot be conceived as clearly as a
triangle: can you say that your own idea of God is as clear as your idea
of a triangle?—As a circle exists without a sphere, so a sphere exists
without a circle.—We call things higher or lower in proportion to their
distance from the earth.—All the Stoics, Pythagoreans, and Platonists,
Empedocles, Maximus Tyrius, Apuleius, and others, bear witness to
ghosts; and no modern denies them*.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *It is presumption
to sneer at such a body of testimony. Cæsar did not ridicule ghosts, but
omens, and if he had listened to Spurina he would not have been
murdered*.\]
