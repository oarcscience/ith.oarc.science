### LETTER XVII. (LXI.)

#### OLDENBURG TO SPINOZA.

\[*Oldenburg thanks Spinoza for the Tractatus Theoligico-Politicus
despatched but not received, and modifies an adverse verdict expressed
in a former letter* (*now lost*).\]

I was unwilling to let pass the convenient opportunity offered me by the
journey to Holland of the learned Dr. Bourgeois, an adherent of the
Reformed religion, for expressing my thanks a few weeks ago for your
treatise forwarded to me, but not yet arrived. But I am doubtful whether
my letter was duly delivered. I indicated in them my opinion on the
treatise; but on deeper and more careful inspection I now think that my
verdict was hasty. Certain arguments seemed to me to be urged at the
expense of religion, as measured by the standard supplied by the common
run of theologians and the received formulas of creeds which are
evidently biassed. But a closer consideration of the whole subject
convinced me, that you are far from attempting any injury to true
religion and sound philosophy, but, on the contrary, strive to exalt and
establish the true object of the Christian religion and the divine
loftiness of fruitful philosophy.

Now that I believe that this is your fixed purpose, I would most
earnestly beg you to have the kindness to write frequently and explain
the nature of what you are now preparing and considering with this
object to your old and sincere friend, who is all eager for the happy
issue of so lofty a design. I sacredly promise you, that I will not

divulge a syllable to anyone, if you enjoin silence; I will only
endeavour gently to prepare the minds of good and wise men for the
reception of those truths, which you will some day bring before a wider
public, and I will try to dispel the prejudices, which have been
conceived against your doctrines. Unless I am quite mistaken, you have
an insight deeper than common into the nature and powers of the human
mind, and its union with the human body. I earnestly beg you to favour
me with your reflections on this subject. Farewell, most excellent Sir,
and favour the devoted admirer of your teaching and virtue,

HENRY OLDENBURG.

London, 8 June, 1675. <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_14"></span>[295:1](corr14.htm#fr_14) The old edition gives
the date 8 Oct., 1665. but this is obviously incorrect, as the Tractatus
Theologico-Politicus was not published till 1670.
