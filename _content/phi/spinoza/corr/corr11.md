### LETTER XIII.A.

#### OLDENBURG TO SPINOZA.

\[*The place of this letter is between Letters XIII. and XIV. It was
written apparently in September, 1665. It mentions the plague, which was
then at its height, the war, and the labours of the Royal Society, and
especially of Boyle. Then comes the passage here given. The letter
terminates with references to the comets, and to Huyghens*.\]

\*     \*     \*     \*     \*     \*

I see that you are engaged not so much in philosophy as in theology, if
I may say so. That is, you are recording your thoughts about angels,
prophecy, and miracles, but you are doing this, perhaps, in a
philosophical manner; however that may be, I am certain that the
work <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6) is worthy of you, and that I am
most anxious to have it. Since these most difficult times prevent free
intercourse, I beg at least that you will not disdain to signify to me
in your next letter <span id="fr_7"></span>[2](#fn_7) your design and
aim in this writing of yours.

Here we are daily expecting news of a second <span
id="fr_8"></span>[3](#fn_8) naval battle, unless indeed your fleet has
retired into port. Virtue, <span id="fr_9"></span>[4](#fn_9) the nature
of which you hint is being discussed among your friends, belongs to wild
beasts not to men. For if men acted according to the guidance of reason,
they would not so tear one another in pieces, as they evidently do. But
what is the good of my complaining? Vices will exist while men do; <span
id="fr_10"></span>[5](#fn_10) but yet they are not continuous, but
compensated by the interposition of better things.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_6"></span>[289:1](corr11.htm#fr_6) The Tractatus
Theologico-Politicus.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[289:2](corr11.htm#fr_7) Spinoza's answer to this
letter is not extant.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[289:3](corr11.htm#fr_8) The English fleet twice
defeated the Dutch in 1665, on June 3rd and Sept. 4th. *Secundo* perhaps
means "successful," but this hardly agrees with Oldenburg's
politeness.—\[TR.\]

<span id="fn_9"></span>[289:4](corr11.htm#fr_9) "Virtus, de quâ
disceptare inter vos innuis, ferina est, non humana." I do not think
that, in the absence of the previous letter from Spinoza here referred
to, the precise meaning of this sentence can be ascertained.—\[<span
class="smallcaps">Tr</span>.\]

<span id="fn_10"></span>[289:5](corr11.htm#fr_10) The same phrase occurs
in Tract. Pol. I. ii.
