### LETTER VIII. (XI.)

#### OLDENBURG TO SPINOZA.

\[*After further replying to Spinoza's criticisms on Boyle's book,
Oldenburg again exhorts his correspondent to publish*.\]

\*     \*     \*     \*     \*     \*

I now proceed to the question which has arisen between us. First, permit
me to ask you whether you have finished the important little work, in
which you treat "of the origin of things and their dependence on the
first cause, and of the improvement of our understanding." Truly, my
dear sir, I believe nothing more pleasing or acceptable to men of true
learning and discrimination could possibly be published than such a
treatise. This is what a man of your talent and disposition should look
to, far more than the gratification of theologians of our time and
fashion. The latter have less regard for truth than for their own
convenience. I, therefore, conjure you, by the bond of our

friendship, by every duty of increasing and proclaiming the truth, not
to begrudge us, or withhold from us your writings o these subjects. If
anything of greater importance than I can foresee prevents you from
publishing the work, I earnestly charge you to give me a summary of it
by letter.

Another book is soon to be published by the learned Boyle, which I will
send you as an exchange. I will add papers, which will acquaint you with
the whole constitution of our Royal Society, whereof I, with twenty
others, am on the Council, and, with one other, am Secretary. I have no
time to discourse of any further subjects. All the confidence which
honest intentions can inspire, all the readiness to serve, which the
smallness of my powers will permit, I pledge to you, and am heartily,

Dear sir, yours wholly,  
H. OLDENBURG.

London, 3 April, 1663.
