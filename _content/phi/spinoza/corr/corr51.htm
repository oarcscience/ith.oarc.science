<p>[<i>Fabritius, under the order and in the name of the .Elector Palatine, offers Spinoza the post of Professor of Philosophy at Heidelberg, under very liberal conditions</i>.]</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Most renowned Sir</span>,&#151;His Most Serene Highness the Elector Palatine,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_61"></A><A HREF="#fn_60"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> my most gracious master, commands me to write to you, who are, as yet, unknown to me, but most favourably regarded by his Most Serene Highness, and to inquire of you, whether you are willing to accept an ordinary professorship of Philosophy in his illustrious university.

<p>earnestly beg you to reply as soon as possible, and to address your answer either under cover to the Most Serene Elector's resident at the Hague, Mr. Grotius, or to Mr. Gilles Van der Hele, so that it may come in the packet of letters usually sent to the court, or else to avail yourself of some other convenient opportunity for transmitting it. I will only add, that if you come here, you will live pleasantly a life worthy of a philosopher, unless events turn out quite contrary to our expectation and hope. So farewell.</p>
