### LETTER LXXII. (LXXXIII.)

#### SPINOZA TO \* \* \* \* <span id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_81)

\[*Spinoza gives the required explanation. Mentions the treatise of
Huet, &c*.\]

<span class="smallcaps">Distinguished Sir</span>,—With regard to your
question as to whether the variety of the universe can be deduced *à
priori* from the conception of extension only, I believe I have shown
clearly enough already that it cannot; and that, therefore, matter has
been ill-defined by Descartes as extension; it must necessarily be
explained through an attribute, which expresses eternal and infinite
essence. But perhaps, some day, if my life be prolonged, I may discuss
the subject with you more clearly. For hitherto I have not been able to
put any of these matters into due order.

As to what you add; namely, that from the definition

<span id="page_410">p. 410</span>

of a given thing considered in itself we can only deduce a single
property, this is, perhaps, true in the case of very simple things
(among which I count figures), but not in realities. For, from the fact
alone, that I define God as a Being to whose essence belongs existence,
I infer several of His properties; namely, that He necessarily exists,
that He is One, unchangeable, infinite, &c. I could adduce several other
examples, which, for the present, I pass over.

In conclusion, I ask you to inquire, whether Huet's treatise (against
the "Tractatus Theologico-Politicus") about which I wrote to you before,
has yet been published, and whether you could send me a copy. Also,
whether you yet know, what are the new discoveries about refraction. And
so farewell, dear Sir, and continue to regard yours, &c.

The Hague, 15 July, 1676.
