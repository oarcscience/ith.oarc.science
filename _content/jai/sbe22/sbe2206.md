#### FOURTH LESSON.

(Thus I say): A man should not, of his own accord, deny the world (of
fire-bodies), nor should he deny the self. He who denies the world (of
fire-bodies), denies the self; and he who denies the self, denies the
world (of fire-bodies). (1) He who knows that (viz. fire) through which
injury is done to the long-living bodies (i.e. plants) <span
id="fr_105"></span>[1](#fn_104), knows also that which does no injury
(i.e. control); and he who knows that which does no injury, knows also
that through which no injury is done to the long-living bodies. (2) This
has been seen by the heroes (of faith) who conquered ignorance; for they
control themselves, always exert themselves, always mind their duty. He
who is unmindful of duty, and desiring of the qualities (i.e. of the
pleasure and profit which may be derived from the elements) is called
the torment <span id="fr_106"></span>[2](#fn_105) (of living beings).
Knowing this, a wise man (resolves): 'Now (I shall do) no more what I
used to do wantonly before.' (3) See! there are men who control
themselves; others pretend only to be houseless; for one destroys this
(fire-body) by bad and injurious doings, and many

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

other beings, besides, which he hurts by means of fire, through his
doing acts relating to fire. About this the Revered One has taught the
truth: for the sake of the splendour, honour, and glory of this life,
for the sake of birth, death, and final liberation, for the removal of
pain, man acts sinfully towards fire, or causes others to act so, or
allows others to act so. (4) This deprives him of happiness and perfect
wisdom. About this he is informed when he has understood, or heard from
the Revered One or from the monks, the faith to be coveted. There are
some who, of a truth, know this (i.e. injuring) to be the bondage, the
delusion, the death, the hell. For this a man is longing, when he
destroys this (fire-body) by bad and injurious doings, and many other
beings, besides, which he hurts by means of fire, through his doing acts
relating to fire. Thus I say. (5)

There are beings living in the earth, living in grass, living on leaves,
living in wood, living in cowdung, living in dust-heaps, jumping beings
which coming near (fire) fall into it. Some, certainly, touched by fire,
shrivel up; those which shrivel up there, lose their sense there; those
which lose their sense there, die there. (6)

He who injures these (fire-bodies) does not comprehend and renounce the
sinful acts; he who does not injure these, comprehends and renounces the
sinful acts. Knowing them, a wise man should not act sinfully towards
fire, nor cause others to act so, nor allow others to act so. He who
knows the causes of sin relating to fire, is called a reward-knowing
sage. Thus I say. (7)
