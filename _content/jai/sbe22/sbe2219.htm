<p>That man (i.e. the liberated) conquers wrath, pride, deceit, and greed. This is the doctrine of the Seer who does not injure living beings and has put an end (to acts and to sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra). Preventing</p>  
<p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="green">p. 34</font></A></p>  
<p>propensity to sin destroys former actions. He who knows one thing, knows all things; and he who knows all things, knows one thing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_182"></A><A HREF="#fn_180"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. He who is careless in all respects, is in danger&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_183"></A><A HREF="#fn_181"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; he who is not careless in all respects, is free from danger. (1)</p>  
<p>He who conquers one (passion), conquers many; and he who conquers many, conquers one. 'Knowing the misery of the world' rejecting the connection with the world, 'the heroes go on the great journey,' they rise gradually; 'they do not desire life.' (2)</p>  
<p>He who avoids one (passion), avoids (them all) severally; and he who avoids them severally, avoids one. Faithful according to the commandment (of the T&icirc;rthakaras), wise, and understanding the world according to the commandment--such a man is without danger&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_184"></A><A HREF="#fn_181"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> from anywhere. There are degrees in injurious acts, but there are no degrees in control. (3)</p>  
<p>He who knows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_182"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> wrath, knows pride; he who knows pride, knows deceit; he who knows deceit, knows greed; he who knows greed, knows love; he who knows love, knows hate; he who knows hate, knows delusion; he who knows delusion, knows conception; he who knows conception, knows birth; he who knows birth, knows death; he who knows death, knows hell; he who knows hell, knows animal existence; he who knows animal existence, knows pain.</p>  
<p>Therefore, a wise man should avoid wrath, pride, deceit, greed, love, hate, delusion, conception, birth, death, hell, animal existence, and pain.</p>

<p>This is the doctrine of the Seer, who does not injure living beings and has put an end (to acts and to sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra). Preventing the propensity to sin destroys former actions. Is there any worldly weakness in the Seer? There exists none, there is none. Thus I say. (4)</p>
