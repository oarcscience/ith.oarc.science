#### SECOND LESSON.

A wise man should remove any aversion (to control <span
id="fr_118"></span>[3](#fn_117)); he will be liberated in the proper
time. Some, following wrong instruction, turn away (from control). They
are dull, wrapped in delusion. While they imitate the life of monks,
(saying), 'We shall be free from attachment,' they enjoy the pleasures
that offer themselves <span id="fr_119"></span>[4](#fn_118). Through
wrong instruction the (would-be) sages trouble themselves (for
pleasures); thus they sink deeper and deeper in delusion, (and cannot
get) to this, nor to the opposite shore <span
id="fr_120"></span>[5](#fn_119). Those who are freed (from attachment to
the world and its pleasures), reach the opposite shore <span
id="fr_121"></span>[6](#fn_120). Subduing desire by desirelessness, he
does not enjoy the pleasures that offer themselves. Desireless, giving
up the world, and ceasing to act, he knows, and sees, and has no wishes
because of his discernment <span id="fr_122"></span>[7](#fn_121); he is
called houseless. (t)

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

(But on the contrary) he suffers day and night, works in the right and
the wrong time, desires wealth and treasures, commits injuries and
violent acts, again and again directs his mind upon these injurious
doings <span id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_122); for his own sake, to
support or to be supported by his relations, friends, the ancestors,
gods, the king, thieves, guests, paupers, *S*rama*n*as. (2)

Thus violence is done by these various acts, deliberately, out of fear,
because they think 'it is for the expiation of sins <span
id="fr_124"></span>[2](#fn_123),' or for some other hope. Knowing this,
a wise man should neither himself commit violence by such acts, nor
order others to commit violence by such acts, nor consent to the
violence done by somebody else.

This road (to happiness) has been declared by the noble ones, that a
clever man should not be defiled (by sin). Thus I say. (3)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_117"></span>[17:3](sbe2211.htm#fr_118) Arati is usually
dislike, âu*tt*ai exercise; but, according to the commentators, these
words here mean sa*m*yamârati and nivartayati.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[17:4](sbe2211.htm#fr_119) E. g. the Buddhists,
&c., *S*âkyâdaya*h*.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[17:5](sbe2211.htm#fr_120) I.e. they are
neither householders nor houseless monks.

<span id="fn_120"></span>[17:6](sbe2211.htm#fr_121) I.e. moksha, final
liberation.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[17:7](sbe2211.htm#fr_122) Viz. between good
and had, or of the results of desire.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[18:1](sbe2211.htm#fr_123) See I, 2, 1, § 1.
