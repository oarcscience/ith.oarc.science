#### SECOND LESSON.

Many do not live by injurious deeds against the world, they do not live
by injurious deeds against

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

these (living beings). Ceasing from them, making an end of them, he
perceives: this is a favourable opportunity <span
id="fr_204"></span>[1](#fn_201); he who searches for <span
id="fr_205"></span>[2](#fn_202) the right moment for this body (should
never be careless). This is the road taught by the noble ones. (1)

When he has become zealous for the law, he should never be careless,
knowing pain and pleasure in their various forms. Men act here on their
own motives; it has been declared that they suffer for their own sins.
Neither killing nor lying, he should (patiently) bear (all unpleasant)
feelings when affected by them. That man is called a true monk. (2)

Those who are not given to sinful acts are (nevertheless) attacked by
calamities; but then the steadfast will bear them. (He has to bear) them
afterwards as (he has done) before (his conversion). (The body) is of a
fragile, decaying nature, (it is) unstable, transient, uneternal,
increasing and decreasing, of a changeable nature. Perceive this as its
true character. For him who well understands this, who delights in the
unique refuge <span id="fr_206"></span>[3](#fn_203), for the liberated
and inactive there is no passage (from birth to birth). Thus I say. (3)

Many are attached to something in the world--be it little or much, small
or great, sentient or nonsentient--they are attached to it (here)
amongst these (householders). Thus some incur great danger. For him who
contemplates the course of the world and does not acknowledge these
attachments (there

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

is no such danger). Knowing that that which is well understood is well
practised, man! with thy eyes on the highest good, be victorious (in
control). Among such men only is real Brahmanhood. Thus I say. (4)

I have heard this, and it is in my innermost heart; and the freedom from
bonds is in your innermost heart. He who has ceased (to have worldly
attachments), the houseless, suffers with patience a long time.

The careless stand outside, the careful lead a religious life.

Maintain rightly this state of a sage. Thus I say. (5)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_201"></span>[44:1](sbe2225.htm#fr_204) For adopting the
right conduct.

<span id="fn_202"></span>[44:2](sbe2225.htm#fr_205) Annesî = anveshin. I
think that annesî may be an aorist of *gñ*â, knew.

<span id="fn_203"></span>[44:3](sbe2225.htm#fr_206) Âyata*n*a, i.e. the
triad: right knowledge, right intuition, right conduct.
