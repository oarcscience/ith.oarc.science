<p>The Venerable One was able to abstain from indulgence of the flesh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_317"></A><A HREF="#fn_313"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, though never attacked by</p>

<p>diseases. Whether wounded or not wounded, he desired not medical treatment. (1)</p>  
<p>Purgatives and emetics, anointing of the body and bathing, shampooing and cleansing of the teeth do not behove him, after he learned (that the body is something unclean). (2)</p>  
<p>Being averse from the impressions of the senses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_318"></A><A HREF="#fn_314"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a wandered about, speaking but little. Sometimes in the cold season the Venerable One was meditating in the shade. (3)</p>  
<p>In summer he exposes himself to the heat, he sits squatting in the sun; he lives on rough (food): rice, pounded jujube, and beans. (4)</p>  
<p>Using these three, the Venerable One sustained himself eight months. Sometimes the Venerable One did not drink for half a month or even for a month. (5)</p>  
<p>Or he did not drink for more than two months, or even six months, day and night, without desire (for drink). Sometimes he ate stale food. (6)</p>  
<p>Sometimes he ate only the sixth meal, or the eighth, the tenth, the twelfth; without desires, persevering in meditation. (7)</p>  
<p>Having wisdom, Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra committed no sin himself, nor did he induce others to do so, nor did he consent to the sins of others. (8)</p>  
<p>Having entered a village or a town, he begged for food which had been prepared for somebody else. Having got clean&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_319"></A><A HREF="#fn_315"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> food, he used it, restraining the impulses. (9)</p>  
<p>When there were hungry crows, or thirsty beings stood in his way, where he begged, or when he saw them flying repeatedly down, (10)</p>

<p>When a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a or <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a, a beggar or guest, a <I>K</I>&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>&acirc;la&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_320"></A><A HREF="#fn_316"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, a cat, or a dog stood in his way, (11)</p>  
<p>Without ceasing in his reflections, and avoiding to overlook them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_321"></A><A HREF="#fn_317"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the Venerable One slowly wandered about, and, killing no creatures, he begged for his food. (12)</p>  
<p>Moist or dry or cold food, old beans, old pap, or bad grain, whether he did or did not get such food, he was rich (in control). (13)</p>  
<p>And Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra meditated (persevering) in some posture, without the smallest motion; he meditated in mental concentration on (the things) above, below, beside, free from desires. (14)</p>  
<p>He meditated free from sin and desire, not attached to sounds or colours; though still an erring mortal (<I>kh</I>admastha), he wandered about, and never acted carelessly. (15)</p>  
<p>Himself understanding the truth and restraining the impulses for the purification of the soul, finally liberated, and free from delusion, the Venerable One was well guarded during his whole life. (16)</p>  
<p>This is the rule which has been followed, &amp;c.</p>
