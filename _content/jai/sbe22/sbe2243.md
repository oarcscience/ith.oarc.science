### EIGHTH LECTURE,

###### (CALLED)

###### THE PILLOW OF RIGHTEOUSNESS.

#### FIRST LESSON.

As I have heard it, I shall tell how the Venerable Ascetic, exerting
himself and meditating, after having entered the order in that winter,
wandered about <span id="fr_301"></span>[1](#fn_297),

'I shall not cover myself with that robe <span
id="fr_302"></span>[2](#fn_298),' only in that winter (he used it). He
had crossed (the sa*m*sâra) for the rest of his life. This (refusing of
dress) is in accordance with his doctrine. (1)

More than four months many sorts of living beings gathered on his body,
crawled about it, and caused pain there. (2)

For a year and a month he did not leave off his robe. Since that time
the Venerable One, giving up his robe, was a naked, world-relinquishing,
houseless (sage) <span id="fr_303"></span>[3](#fn_299). (3)

Then he meditated (walking) with his eye fixed on a square space before
him of the length of a

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

man <span id="fr_304"></span>[1](#fn_300). Many people assembled,
shocked at the sight; they struck him and cried. (4)

Knowing (and renouncing) the female sex in mixed gathering places <span
id="fr_305"></span>[2](#fn_301), he meditated, finding his way himself:
I do not lead a worldly life. (5)

Giving up the company <span id="fr_306"></span>[3](#fn_302) of all
householders whomsoever, he meditated. Asked, he gave no answer; he
went, and did not transgress the right path. (6)

For some it is not easy (to do what he did), not to answer those who
salute; he was beaten with sticks, and struck by sinful people. (7)

Disregarding slights difficult to bear, the Sage wandered about, (not
attracted) by story-tellers, pantomimes, songs, fights at quarter-staff,
and boxing-matches. (8)

At that time the son of *Gñ*ât*ri* saw without sorrow (or pleasure)
people in mutual conversation. *Gñ*ât*ri*putra obtained oblivion of
these exquisite sorrows. (9)

For more than a couple of years he led a religious life without using
cold water; he realised singleness, guarded his body, had got intuition,
and was calm. (10)

Thoroughly knowing the earth-bodies and water-bodies and fire-bodies and
wind-bodies, the lichens, seeds, and sprouts, (11)

He comprehended that they are, if narrowly

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

inspected, imbued with life, and avoided to injure them; he, the great
Hero. (12)

The immovable (beings) are changed to movable ones, and the movable
beings to immovable ones; beings which are born in all states become
individually sinners <span id="fr_307"></span>[1](#fn_303) by their
actions. (13)

The Venerable One understands thus: he who is under the conditions (of
existence) <span id="fr_308"></span>[2](#fn_304), that fool suffers
pain. Thoroughly knowing (karman), the Venerable One avoids sin. (14)

The sage, perceiving the double (karman) <span
id="fr_309"></span>[3](#fn_305), proclaims the incomparable
activity <span id="fr_310"></span>[4](#fn_306), he, the knowing one;
knowing the current of worldliness, the current of sinfulness, and the
impulse, (15)

Practising the sinless abstinence from killing, he did no acts, neither
himself nor with the assistance of others; he to whom women were known
as the causes of all sinful acts, he saw (the true state of the world).
(16)

He did not use what had expressly been prepared for him <span
id="fr_311"></span>[5](#fn_307); he well saw (that bondage comes)
through action. Whatever is sinful, the Venerable One left that undone:
he consumed clean food. (17)

He did not use another's robe, nor does he eat out of another's vessel.
Disregarding contempt, he went with indifference to places where food
was prepared. (18)

Knowing measure in eating and drinking, he was not desirous of delicious
food, nor had he a longing for it. A sage should not rub his eyes nor
scratch his body. (19)

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

Looking a little sideward, looking a little behind, answering little
when spoken to, he should walk attentively looking on his path. (20)

When the cold season has half-way advanced, the houseless, leaving off
his robe and stretching out his arms, should wander about, not leaning
against a trunk. (21)

This is the rule which has often been followed by the wise Brâhma*n*a,
the Venerable One, who is free from attachment: thus proceed (the
monks).

Thus I say. (22)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_297"></span>[79:1](sbe2243.htm#fr_301) The commentators
call this passage a *s*loka, though only the beginning of it looks like
a pâda, the rest showing no metrical law. The beginning of the last
passage looks also like the first pâda of a *s*loka; but the rest
requires some violent alterations to answer the metrical laws of a
*s*loka.

<span id="fn_298"></span>[79:2](sbe2243.htm#fr_302) The divine robe
given him by Indra.

<span id="fn_299"></span>[79:3](sbe2243.htm#fr_303) The commentator says
that this happened at the Suvar*n*abâlukâ river.

<span id="fn_300"></span>[80:1](sbe2243.htm#fr_304) Tiriyabhitti*m* is
left out in the translation. I cannot make out the exact meaning of it,
perhaps: 'so that he was a wall for the animals.'

<span id="fn_301"></span>[80:2](sbe2243.htm#fr_305) Saya*n*ehi*m* in the
original.

<span id="fn_302"></span>[80:3](sbe2243.htm#fr_306) Literally, the mixed
state.

<span id="fn_303"></span>[81:1](sbe2243.htm#fr_307) Or sinful? bâlâ.

<span id="fn_304"></span>[81:2](sbe2243.htm#fr_308) Upadhi.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[81:3](sbe2243.htm#fr_309) Present and future.

<span id="fn_306"></span>[81:4](sbe2243.htm#fr_310) I.e. religious life.

<span id="fn_307"></span>[81:5](sbe2243.htm#fr_311) Ahâka*d*am: yathâ
yena prakâre*n*a p*ri*sh*t*vâ ap*ri*sh*t*vâ vâ k*ri*ta*m* yathâk*ri*tam
âdhâkarmâdinâ.
