<p>'Knowing the connection of the world, (carelessness is not for his benefit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_172"></A><A HREF="#fn_171"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>).' 'Look at the exterior</p>

What is the characteristic of a sage? 'Recognising the equality (of all living beings), he appeases <A HREF="errata.htm#0">himself</A>.' (1)</p>  
<p><DIR>Knowing the highest good, one should never be careless;<br> Guarding one's self, always prudent, one should pass life on the right road.</DIR></p>  
<p>'One should acquire disregard of sensual enjoyment, being with a great one (i.e. a god) or the small ones (men).' When one knows whence men come and where they go, and when both ends are out of sight&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_173"></A><A HREF="#fn_172"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, one is not cut, nor slit, nor burnt, nor struck&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_174"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (2) by any one in the whole world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_174"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>Some do not remember what preceded the present: 'what has been his past? what will be his future?' Some men here say: 'what has been his past, that will be his future&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_176"></A><A HREF="#fn_175"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p><DIR>There is no past thing, nor is there a future one;<br> So opine the Tath&acirc;gatas.</DIR></p>

<p>who recognises the truth (stated above) and destroys sinfulness (thinks):</p>  
<p>What is discontent and what is pleasure? not subject to either, one should live;</p>  
<p>Giving up all gaiety, circumspect and restrained, one should lead a religious life. (3)</p>  
<p>Man! Thou art thy own friend; why wishest thou for a friend beyond thyself? Whom he knows as a dweller on high&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_177"></A><A HREF="#fn_176"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, him he should know as a dweller far (from sin) and whom he knows as a dweller far (from sin), him he should know as a dweller on high. Man! restraining thyself (from the outward world) 'thou wilt get free from pain.' Man, understand well the truth! exerting himself in the rule of truth a wise man overcomes M&acirc;ra. (4)</p>  
<p>'The gifted man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_178"></A><A HREF="#fn_177"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, following the law, sees well his true interest.' In a twofold way&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_179"></A><A HREF="#fn_178"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, for the sake of life's splendour, honour and glory (some men exert themselves), wherein they go astray. The gifted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_180"></A><A HREF="#fn_177"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, touched by calamity, are not confounded. 'Mind this! the worthy one, in this world, gets out of the creation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_181"></A><A HREF="#fn_179"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.' Thus I say. (5)</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_171"></A><A HREF="sbe2218.htm#fr_172">31:4</A> This is a very difficult passage. Connection (sandhi) is explained in different ways, as karmavivara, samyag<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;n&acirc;v&acirc;pti, and the state of the soul, which has only temporarily and not thoroughly come to rest. To complete the sentence the commentators add pram&acirc;do na <I>s</I>reyase. As the words of the text form the p&acirc;da of a <I>s</I>loka, it is probable that something like pam&acirc;o neva se<I>g</I><I>g</I>ase <a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="green">p. 32</font></A> concluded the hemistich. The meaning is, 'Make good use of any opening to get out of worldly troubles.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_172"></A><A HREF="sbe2218.htm#fr_173">32:1</A> See 1, lesson 4.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_173"></A><A HREF="sbe2218.htm#fr_174">32:2</A> The reading of the N&acirc;g&acirc;r<I>g</I>un&icirc;yas, according to the commentary, was, 'Knowing well and essentially the five (perceptions) in the object and the three degrees (i.e. good, middle, bad), in the twofold (i.e. what is to be avoided and to be adopted), one is not marred by either (love and hate).' These words form a <I>s</I>loka.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_174"></A><A HREF="sbe2218.htm#fr_175">32:3</A> The commentary connects these words with the preceding sentence, saying that the accusative stands for the instrumental, by any one.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_175"></A><A HREF="sbe2218.htm#fr_176">32:4</A> The words of the original read like a trish<I>t</I>ubh in disorder; the same is the case with a different reading quoted by the commentator.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_176"></A><A HREF="sbe2218.htm#fr_177">33:1</A> There is apparently a pun in the text: u<I>k</I><I>k</I>&acirc;laiya<I>m</I> is explained by u<I>k</I><I>k</I>&acirc;layit&acirc;ram = remover (of sins), but as contrasted with d&ucirc;r&acirc;laiya it has the meaning we have adopted above.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_177"></A><A HREF="sbe2218.htm#fr_180">33:2</A> With knowledge, &amp;c.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_178"></A><A HREF="sbe2218.htm#fr_179">33:3</A> For the sake of love and hate, or worldly and heavenly bliss.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_179"></A><A HREF="sbe2218.htm#fr_181">33:4</A> If loy&acirc;loya is omitted, the last words form the half of a <I>s</I>loka.</P>
