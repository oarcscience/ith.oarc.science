<p>He who is awakened amongst men, preaches; the man to whom all these classes of lives are well known, preaches the unparalleled wisdom. He praises the road to liberation for those who well exert themselves, who have forsworn cruelty, are zealous and endowed with knowledge. Thus some great heroes are victorious; but, look, some others who are wanting in control do not understand (the welfare of) their souls. Thus I say. (1)</p>  
<p>As in a lake a greedy leaf-covered tortoise cannot rise up; as the trees do not leave their place (though shaken by storms, &amp;c.): thus men, born in various families, cry bitterly because they are attached to the objects of the senses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_234"></A><A HREF="#fn_231"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; on account of their sinfulness they do not reach liberation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_235"></A><A HREF="#fn_232"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. (2)</p>  
<p>Now look at those who are born in these families to reap the fruit of their own acts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_236"></A><A HREF="#fn_233"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>:</p>  
<p>Boils and leprosy, consumption, falling sickness, blindness and stiffness, lameness and humpbackedness, 1</p>

<p>Dropsy and dumbness, look! apoplexy(?) and eye-disease, trembling and crippledness, elephantiasis and diabetes, 2</p>  
<p>These are the sixteen diseases enumerated in due order; besides them many illnesses and wounds occur. 3</p>  
<p>Contemplating their (i.e. the creatures') death, knowing their births in higher and lower regions, contemplating the fruit (of their acts), hear about this according to truth. 4</p>  
<p>There are said to be blind beings dwelling in darkness; once or frequently meeting this lot, they experience pleasant and unpleasant feelings. This has been declared by the awakened ones. (3) There are beings endowed with voice, with taste, water-beings dwelling in water, beings living in the air: 'beings torment beings. See the great danger in this world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_237"></A><A HREF="#fn_234"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>;' many pains (are the lot) of the creatures. Men who are given to their lusts, come to destruction through their weak, frail body. 'The fool works hard, thinking' that the unhappy one suffers many pains. 'Knowing that these diseases are many, should the afflicted search after (remedies)?' See! they are of no avail, have done with them! Sage! see this great danger! Do not hurt anybody! Contemplate. Be attentive! I shall proclaim the doctrine of renunciation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_238"></A><A HREF="#fn_235"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. (4)</p>  
<p>To reap the fruit of their acts they are born in these various families, they increase, are born, grow up, become awakened, and leave the world in due order as great sages. The lamenting parents say to them who proceed on the glorious road: 'Do not</p>

<p>leave us!' (5) Consulting their own pleasure, indulging their passions, 'making a noise&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_239"></A><A HREF="#fn_236"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the parents cry:' No man who leaves his parents is (fit to become) a flood-crossing sage! (The ascetic) does not take refuge there (in his family); for what could attract him there?</p>  
<p>He should always maintain this knowledge! Thus I say. (6)</p>
