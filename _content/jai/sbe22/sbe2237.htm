<p>Some are awakened as middle-aged men and exert themselves well, having, as clever men, heard and received the word of the learned&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_267"></A><A HREF="#fn_264"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The noble ones have impartially preached the law. Those who are awakened, should not wish for pleasure, nor do harm, nor desire (any forbidden things). A person who is without desires and does no harm unto any living beings in the whole world, is called by me 'unfettered.' (1)</p>  
<p>One free from passions understands perfectly the bright one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_268"></A><A HREF="#fn_265"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, knowing birth in the upper and nether regions.</p>  
<p>'Bodies increase through nourishment, they are frail in hardships.' See some whose organs are failing (give way to weakness).</p>  
<p>A person who has no desires, cherishes pity. He who understands the doctrine of sin, is a mendicant who knows the time, the strength, the measure, the occasion, the conduct, the religious precept; he disowns all things not requisite for religious purposes,</p>

<p>in time exerts himself, is under no obligations; he proceeds securely (on the road to final liberation) after having cut off both (love and hate)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_269"></A><A HREF="sbe2238.htm#fn_266"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. (2)</p>  
<p>A householder approaching a mendicant whose limbs tremble for cold, may say:</p>  
<p>O long-lived <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a! are you not subject to the influences of your senses?</p>  
<p>O long-lived householder! I am not subject to the influences of my senses. But I cannot sustain the feeling of cold. Yet it does not become me to kindle or light a fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_270"></A><A HREF="sbe2238.htm#fn_267"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, that I may warm or heat myself; nor (to procure that comfort) through the order of others.</p>  
<p>Perhaps after the mendicant has spoken thus, the other kindles or lights a fire that he may warm or heat himself. But the mendicant should well observe and understand this, that he may order him to show no such obsequiousness. Thus I say. (3)</p>
