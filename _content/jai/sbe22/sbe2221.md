#### SECOND LESSON.

There are as many âsravas <span id="fr_190"></span>[1](#fn_187) as there
are parisravas, and there are as many parisravas as there are âsravas.
There are as many anâsravas as there are aparisravas, and there are as
many aparisravas as there are anâsravas. He who well understands these
words and regards the world according to the instruction (and
understands), that which has been distinctly declared, that 'wise man
proclaims (the truth) here to men,' who still belong to the sa*m*sâra,
who are awakened, and have reached discrimination. (1)

'Those also who are afflicted and careless' (will be instructed). I say
this as a truth. There is nothing secure from the mouth of death. Those
who are led by their desires, who are the tabernacle of fraud, 'who
seized by Time dwell in the heap (of karman),' are born again and again.
\[Many who are again and again (immersed) in delusion, (will

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

often renew) their acquaintance with the places of pain; they experience
the pains inherent in regeneration. He who often does cruel acts, often
undergoes (punishment in hell, &c.) He who seldom does cruel acts,
seldom undergoes (punishment).\] <span id="fr_191"></span>[1](#fn_188)
(2)

Some say thus, also the wise ones; the wise ones say thus, also some
others <span id="fr_192"></span>[2](#fn_189). Many and several in this
world, Brâhma*n*as or *S*rama*n*as, raise this discussion: We have seen,
heard, acknowledged, thoroughly understood, in the upper, nether, and
sidelong directions, and in all ways examined it: all sorts of living
beings may be slain, or treated with violence, or abused, or tormented,
or driven away. Know about this: there is no wrong in it. (3)

That is a doctrine of the unworthy. But those who are teachers, have
said: You have wrongly seen, wrongly heard, wrongly acknowledged,
wrongly understood, in the upper, nether, and sidelong directions, in
all ways wrongly examined it, when you say thus, speak thus, declare
thus, explain thus: All sorts of living beings may be slain, or treated
with violence, or abused, or tormented, or driven away. Know about this:
there is no wrong in it. That is a doctrine of the unworthy. (4) But we
say thus, speak thus, declare thus, explain thus:

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> All sorts of
living beings should not be slain, nor treated with violence, nor
abused, nor tormented, nor driven away. Know about this, there is no
wrong in it. This is the doctrine of the teachers. (5)

First the persuasion of every one should be ascertained, and then we
will ask them severally: Ye professors! is pain pleasant to you, or
unpleasant? If they give the right answer, reply: For all sorts of
living beings pain is unpleasant, disagreeable. and greatly feared. Thus
I say. (6)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_187"></span>[37:1](sbe2221.htm#fr_190) Âsrava is that by
means of which karman takes effect upon the soul, parisrava that
(nir*g*arâ, &c.) by which the influence of karman is counteracted.
Anâsrava is that by which âsrava is avoided (religious vows), and
aparisrava that by which karman is acquired.

<span id="fn_188"></span>[38:1](sbe2221.htm#fr_191) The passage in
brackets is introduced by the words pâ*th*ântara*m* vâ, 'various
reading.' It occurs in all MSS. I have consulted, and is commented upon
by the commentaries as belonging to the text.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[38:2](sbe2221.htm#fr_192) By some is meant the
highest class of sages. The meaning is that all professors, high or low,
say the same, agree in the doctrine of ahi*m*sâ.
