#### FOURTH LESSON.

For a monk who has not yet reached discrimination <span
id="fr_212"></span>[1](#fn_209), it is bad going and difficult
proceeding when he wanders (alone) from village to village. Some men
(when going wrong) will become angry when exhorted with speech. And a
man with wary pride is embarrassed with great delusion <span
id="fr_213"></span>[2](#fn_210). (1) There are many obstacles which are
very difficult to overcome for the ignorant and the blinded. Let that
not be your case! That is the doctrine of the clever one (Mahavîra).
Adopting the (â*k*ârya's) views, imitating his indifference (for the
outer world), making him the guide and adviser (in all one's matters),
sharing his abode, living carefully, acting according to his mind,
examining one's way <span id="fr_214"></span>[3](#fn_211), not coming
too near (the â*k*ârya), minding living beings, one should go (on one's
business). (2)

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

(A monk should according to the â*k*ârya's order) go and return,
contract or stretch (his limbs), thoroughly clean (what ought to be
cleaned). Sometimes, though a monk be endowed with virtue and walks in
righteousness, living beings, coming in contact with his body, will be
killed. (If this happens through mere carelessness) then he will get his
punishment in this life; but if it was done contrary to the rules <span
id="fr_215"></span>[1](#fn_212), he should repent of it and do penance
for it <span id="fr_216"></span>[2](#fn_213). Thus he who knows the
sacred lore <span id="fr_217"></span>[3](#fn_214), recommends penance
combined with carefulness. (3)

(When a monk) with fully developed intuition and knowledge, calm,
guarded, endowed (with knowledge), always restrained, perceives (a woman
tempting him), he should consider within himself: what will this person
do? The greatest temptation in this world are women. This has been
declared by the sage. (4)

When strongly vexed by the influence of the senses, he should eat bad
food, mortify himself, stand upright, wander from village to village,
take no food at all, withdraw his mind from women. First troubles, then
pleasures; first pleasures, then troubles <span
id="fr_218"></span>[4](#fn_215): thus they are the cause of quarrels.
Considering this and well understanding it, one should teach oneself not
to cultivate (sensuality). Thus I say. He should not speak of women, nor
look at them, nor converse with them, nor claim them as his own, nor do
their work. Careful in his speech and

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

guarding his mind, he should always avoid sin. He should maintain this
sagedom. Thus I say. (5)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_209"></span>[47:1](sbe2227.htm#fr_212) Avyakta, either with
regard to sruta, sacred knowledge, or to his age.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[47:2](sbe2227.htm#fr_213) The result will be
that he thinks himself above the admonition of the spiritual head
(â*k*ârya) of the chapter (ga*kkh*a), and leaves the chapter, living as
a ga*kkh*anirgata.

<span id="fn_211"></span>[47:3](sbe2227.htm#fr_214) The monk must
closely inspect everything with which he comes in contact in order to
avoid killing animals; this holds good with regard to walking, sitting,
sleeping, eating, drinking, &c.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[48:1](sbe2227.htm#fr_215) Âu*tt*îkamma*m* =
âku*tt*ikarman.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[48:2](sbe2227.htm#fr_216) Vivega = viveka,
explained as prâya*sk*ittam.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[48:3](sbe2227.htm#fr_217) Vedavid.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[48:4](sbe2227.htm#fr_218) In order to attain
pleasure, one has to work for the means; after the enjoyment of the
pleasures one has to undergo punishment in hell, &c.
