<p>A mendicant may exert himself, or stand or sit or lie in a burying-place or in an empty house or in a mountain cave or in a potter's workshop. A householder may approach a mendicant who stays in any of these places, and say unto him: O long-lived <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a! I shall give you what I have bought or stolen or taken, though it was not to be taken, nor given, but was taken by force, viz. food, drink, dainties and spices, clothes, an alms-bowl, a plaid, a broom--by acting sinfully against all sorts of living beings; or I shall prepare you snug lodgings; eat (the offered food), dwell (in the prepared house&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_265"></A><A HREF="#fn_262"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>). (1)</p>  
<p>O long-lived <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a! A mendicant should thus refuse a householder of good sense and ripe age: O long-lived householder! I do not approve of thy words, I do not accept thy words, that, for my sake, thou givest unto me what thou hast bought or stolen or taken, though it was not to be taken, nor given, but was taken by force, viz. food, drink, dainties and spices, clothes, an alms-bowl, a plaid, a broom--by</p>

<p><a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="green">p. 65</font></A></p>  
<p>acting sinfully against all sorts of living beings; or that thou preparest pleasant lodgings for me. O long-lived householder! I have given up this, because it is not to be done. (2) A mendicant may exert himself, &amp;c. (first sentence of &sect; 1). A householder, without betraying his intention, may approach him who stays in some one of the above-mentioned places, and give unto him what has been taken, &amp;c. (all as above, down to) or prepare pleasant lodgings, and accommodate the mendicant with food (and lodging). A mendicant should know it by his own innate intelligence, or through the instruction of the highest (i.e. the T&icirc;rthakaras), or having heard it from others: This householder, forsooth, for my sake injures all sorts of living beings, to give me food, &amp;c., clothes, &amp;c., or to prepare pleasant lodgings. A mendicant should well observe and understand this, that he may order (the householder) not to show such obsequiousness. Thus I say. (3)</p>  
<p>Those who having, with or without the mendicant's knowledge, brought together fetters&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_266"></A><A HREF="#fn_263"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, become angry (on the monk's refusal) and will strike him, saying: Beat, kill, cut, burn, roast, tear, rob, despatch, torture him! But the hero, come to such a lot, will bravely bear it, or tell him the code of conduct, considering that he is of a different habit; or by guarding his speech he should in due order examine the subject, guarding himself.</p>  
<p>This has been declared by the awakened ones: The faithful should not give to dissenters food, &amp;c., clothes, &amp;c., nor should they exhort them (to give),</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_66"><font size="1" color="green">p. 66</font></A></p>  
<p>nor do them service, always showing the highest respect. Thus I say. (4)</p>  
<p>Know the law declared by the wise Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a one should give to one of the same faith food, &amp;c., clothes, &amp;c., and one should exhort him (to give) or do him service, always showing the highest respect. Thus I say. (5)</p>
