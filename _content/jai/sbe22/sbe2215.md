#### SIXTH LESSON.

He who perfectly understands (what has been said in the preceding
lesson) and follows the (faith) to be coveted, should therefore do no
sinful act, nor cause others to do one. Perchance he meditates a sin (by
an act against only) one (of the six aggregates of lives); but he will
be guilty (of sin against) every one of the six, Desiring happiness and
bewailing much, he comes ignorantly to grief through his own misfortune.
(1) Through his own carelessness every one produces that phase of life
in which the vital spirits are pained. Observing (the pain of mundane
existence, one should) not (act) with violence. This is called the true
knowledge (and renunciation). He who ceasing from acts relinquishes the
idea of property, relinquishes property itself. That sage has seen the
path (to final liberation) for whom there exists no property. Knowing
this, a wise man, who knows the world and has cast off the idea of the
world,

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

should prudently conquer <span id="fr_147"></span>[1](#fn_146) the
obstructions to righteousness. Thus I say. (2)

The hero does not tolerate discontent,

The hero does not tolerate lust.

Because the hero is not careless,

The hero is not attached (to the objects of the senses).

Being indifferent against sounds (and the other) perceptions, detest the
comfort of this life.

A sage adopting a life of wisdom, should treat his gross body roughly.

The heroes who have right intuition, use mean and rough food <span
id="fr_148"></span>[2](#fn_147).

Such a man is said to have crossed the flood (of life), to be a sage, to
have passed over (the sa*m*sâra), to be liberated, to have ceased (from
all activity). Thus I say. (3)

A sage is called unfit who does not follow the law and fails in his
office. (But on the contrary) he is praised as a hero, he overcomes the
connection with the world, he is called the guide (or the right way).
What has been declared to be here the unhappiness of mortals, of that
unhappiness the clever ones propound the knowledge. (4)

Thus understanding (and renouncing) acts, a man who recognises the
truth, delights in nothing else; and he who delights only in the truth,
recognises nothing else. As (the law) has been revealed for the full
one, so for the empty one; as for the empty

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

one, so for the full one <span id="fr_149"></span>[1](#fn_148). But he
(to whom the faith is preached) will perhaps disrespectfully beat (the
preacher). Yet know, there is no good in this (indiscriminate
preaching). (But ascertain before) what sort of man he is, and whom he
worships. He is called a hero who liberates the bound, above, below, and
in the sideward directions. He always conforms to all knowledge (and
renunciation); the hero is not polluted by the sin of killing. He is a
wise man who perfectly knows the non-killing <span
id="fr_150"></span>[2](#fn_149), who searches after the liberation of
the bound. The clever one is neither bound nor liberated; he should do
or leave undone (what the hero does or does not do); he should not do
what (the hero) leaves undone:

Knowing (and renouncing) murder of any kind and worldly ideas in all
respects <span id="fr_151"></span>[3](#fn_150).

He who sees himself, needs no instruction. But the miserable and
afflicted fool who delights in pleasures and whose miseries do not
cease, is turned round in the whirl of pains <span
id="fr_152"></span>[4](#fn_151). Thus I say. (5)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_146"></span>[26:1](sbe2215.htm#fr_147) See [p.
17](sbe2210.htm#page_17), note [1](sbe2210.htm#fn_115).

<span id="fn_147"></span>[26:2](sbe2215.htm#fr_148) These words
apparently form a *s*loka, though the third pâda is too short by one
syllable; but this fault can easily be corrected by inserting *k*a:
pa*m*ta*m* lûha*m* *k*a sevanti. The commentators treat the passage as
prose.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[27:1](sbe2215.htm#fr_149) The full and the
empty designate those who adopt the true faith, and those who do not.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[27:2](sbe2215.htm#fr_150) A*n*ugghâya*n*a.
According to the commentator, the destruction of karman.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[27:3](sbe2215.htm#fr_151) This is again a
stray half *s*loka. The text abounds in minor fragments of verses,
trish*t*ubhs, or *s*lokas.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[27:4](sbe2215.htm#fr_152) See the end of the
Third Lesson.
