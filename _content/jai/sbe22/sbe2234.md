#### FIFTH LESSON.

Staying in or between houses, in or between villages, in or between
towns, in or between counties, a monk is attacked by murderers, or is
subject to the hardships (of a mendicant's life). A hero should bear
these hardships. (1)

A saint <span id="fr_256"></span>[2](#fn_253), with right intuition, who
cherishes compassion for the world, in the east, west, south, and north,
should preach, spread, and praise (the faith), knowing the sacred
lore <span id="fr_257"></span>[3](#fn_254). He should proclaim it among
those who exert themselves, and those who do not <span
id="fr_258"></span>[4](#fn_255), among those who are willing to hear
(the word). (2)

Not neglecting tranquillity, indifference, patience, liberation, purity,
uprightness, gentleness, and freedom from worldly cares <span
id="fr_259"></span>[5](#fn_256), one should, with due consideration,
preach the law of the mendicants to all sorts of creatures. (3)

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

With due consideration preaching the law of the mendicants, one should
do no injury to one's self, nor to anybody else, nor to any of the four
kinds of living beings. But a great sage, neither injuring nor injured,
becomes a shelter for all sorts of afflicted creatures, even as an
island, which is never covered with water. (4)

Thus a man who exerts himself, and is of a steady mind, without
attachment, unmoved (by passion) but restless (in wandering about),
having no worldly desires, should lead the life of an ascetic.

Having contemplated the beautiful law, the discerning one is liberated.

Therefore look at worldliness, ye men, fettered in fetters!

Those whom lust conquers, sink; therefore do not shrink from the hard
(control)! He who knows (and renounces) perfectly and thoroughly these
injurious acts, from whom the injurers do not shrink <span
id="fr_260"></span>[1](#fn_257), 'who has shaken off wrath, pride,'
delusion, and greed, 'he is called a removed one.' Thus I say. (5)

On the decay of the body (he does not despond, but deserves) his
appellation, 'the leader of the battle.' The sage who has reached the
other side, unafflicted and unmoved like a beam, being in the power of
death, desires death as the dissolution of the body. Thus I say. (6)

End of the Sixth Lecture, called the Cleaning.
