#### FOURTH LESSON.

The disciples are thus regularly instructed, day and night, by the
knowledge-endowed great heroes, receiving knowledge from them. Some,
being seduced from the calmness of the mind, adopt rough manners. Some,
living in chastity, dispute the authority (of the teacher), others hear
and understand his words; they intend to lead a godly life, but having
left the world <span id="fr_252"></span>[2](#fn_249), they are not
qualified (for a religious life). Others, being incensed by lusts,

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

greedy, sensual, 'do not care for abstract meditation and religious
instruction: these men speak harshly unto the teacher.' It is a second
folly of the slow-minded to call virtuous, calm, religiously living men
worthless.

Some, turning from (control), assign its difficulty as their reason (for
doing so) <span id="fr_253"></span>[1](#fn_250); others, falling from
the pure knowledge and defiling the creed, though not without devotion,
for the love of life change (their vows). 'When they feel the hardships
(of a religious life) they slide back, for their love of life.' Their
leaving the world is a bad leaving. (1)

Those who deserve to be called fools, are born again and again. Standing
low (in learning or control) they will exalt themselves (and say) in
their pride: I am learned. They speak harshly unto the passionless; they
upbraid them with their former trades, or revile them with untrue
reproaches <span id="fr_254"></span>[2](#fn_251). The wise, therefore,
should know the law. Thou lovest unrighteousness, because thou art
young, and lovest acts, and sayest: 'Kill beings;' thou killest them or
consentest to their being killed by others. (Such a man) thinks
contemptuously: A very severe religion has been proclaimed. Sinking in
opposition to the law, he is called murderer. Thus I say. (2)

Some think: What have I to do with this or that man? Thus they leave
father and mother, kith and kin, like heroes exerting themselves, free
from murder. Look! the pious and calm become

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

desponding; the rising, cast down. Those troubled with sensuality, the
cowardly men become perverters of the faith <span
id="fr_255"></span>[1](#fn_252). Therefore the reputation of some
becomes bad. He is an apostate ascetic! He is an apostate ascetic! (3)

Look! Some, though living with religious, pious, calm, and worthy
(monks), are not religious, nor pious, nor calm, nor worthy. Knowing
them, the learned, the wise, the steadfast hero will always be
victorious through the right faith. Thus I say. (4)

their teacher?

<span id="fn_250"></span>[59:1](sbe2233.htm#fr_253) They do not upbraid
their teachers, and hence are not guilty of the second folly.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[59:2](sbe2233.htm#fr_254) Compare second
lesson, § 3. Paliya, which we have here as in the passage above
translated former trade,' is here explained by anush*th*âna, exertion.
