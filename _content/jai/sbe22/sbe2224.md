### FIFTH LECTURE,

###### CALLED

###### ESSENCE OF THE WORLD.

#### FIRST LESSON.

Many entertain cruel thoughts against the world with a motive or without
one; they entertain cruel thoughts against these (six classes of living
beings). To him <span id="fr_201"></span>[1](#fn_198) pleasures are
dear. Therefore he is near death. Because he is near death, he is far
(from liberation). But he who is neither near (death) nor far (from
liberation), considers the life of a slow and ignorant fool as similar
to a dewdrop trembling on the sharp point of the blade of Ku*s*a grass
which falls down when shaken by the wind. A fool, doing cruel acts,
comes thereby ignorantly to grief. Through delusion he is born, dies,
&c.' Being conversant with the deliberation about this delusion, one is
conversant with the sa*m*sâra; being not conversant with that
deliberation, one is not conversant with the sa*m*sâra. He who is
clever, should not seek after sexual intercourse. But having done so,
(it would be) a second folly of the weak-minded not to own it. Repenting
and excluding (from the mind) the begotten pleasures, one should
instruct others to follow the commandment. Thus I say. (1)

See! many who desire colours, are led around

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (in the
sa*m*sâra), they (experience) here again and again feelings (i.e.
punishment) <span id="fr_202"></span>[1](#fn_199). Many live by
injurious deeds against the world, they live by injurious deeds against
these (living beings) <span id="fr_203"></span>[2](#fn_200). Also the
fool, suffering (for his passions), delights in bad acts here, mistaking
that for salvation which is none. Many (heretics) lead the life of a
hermit (in order to avoid worldly sorrows and pains). (2)

Such a man has much wrath, much pride, much conceit, much greed; he
delights in many (works), acts frequently like a stage-player or a
rogue, forms many plans, gives way to his impulses, is influenced by his
acts though he pretends to be awakened: (thinking) that nobody will see
him. Through the influence of ignorance and carelessness the fool never
knows the law. Men! unhappy creatures, world-wise are those who, not
freeing themselves from ignorance, talk about final liberation: they
turn round and round in the whirlpool (of births). Thus I say. (3)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_198"></span>[42:1](sbe2224.htm#fr_201) The change of number
here and in the analogous passages at the beginning of the second and
third lessons is one of the grammatical irregularities in which our text
abounds.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[43:1](sbe2224.htm#fr_202) This interpretation
of the scholiast can scarcely be correct. Probably the same ideas which
are introduced in the last paragraph with the words, Being conversant
with, &c., are to be repeated here. For this passage is similar to the
commencement of that in § 1, or identical if we adopt the pâ*th*ântaram.

<span id="fn_200"></span>[43:2](sbe2224.htm#fr_203) This passage is
perfectly analogous to that in the beginning of the lesson. But the
scholiast explains the locatives which we have, according to his
explanation in the former place, translated against the world, against
these, here and in the similar passages which occur in this lecture, by,
in the world, amongst these, viz. householders.
