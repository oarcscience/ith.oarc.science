<p>Some not instructed (in the true law) make (only a show) of good conduct; some, though instructed,</p>

<p>have no good conduct. Let that not be your case! That is the doctrine of the clever one. Adopting the (&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya's) views, imitating his indifference (for the outer world), making him the guide and adviser (in all one's matters), sharing his abode, conquering (sinfulness), one sees the truth; unconquered one should be one's own master, having no reliance on anything (in the world). He who is great and withdraws his mind from the outer world, should learn the teaching (of the T&icirc;rthakaras) through the teaching (of the &acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya); by his own innate knowledge, or through the instruction of the highest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_225"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, or having heard it from others. A wise man should not break the commandment. Examining all (wrong) doctrines from all sides and in all respects, one should clearly understand (and reject) them. 'Knowing the delight of this world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_226"></A><A HREF="#fn_223"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, circumspect and restrained, one should lead the life of an ascetic.' Desiring liberation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_227"></A><A HREF="#fn_224"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, a hero should, through the sacred lore, ever be victorious. Thus I say. (1)</p>  
<p>The current (of sin)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_228"></A><A HREF="#fn_225"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> is said to come from above, from below, and from the sides; these have been declared to be the currents through which, look, there is sinfulness.</p>  
<p>'Examining the whirlpool&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_229"></A><A HREF="#fn_226"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, a man, versed in the sacred lore, should keep off from it.' Leaving the world to avert the current (of sin), such a great</p>

<p>man, free from acts, knows and sees the truth; examining (pleasures) he does not desire them. (2) Knowing whence we come and whither we go, he leaves the road to birth and death, rejoicing in the glorious (liberation). 'All sounds recoil thence, where speculation has no room,' nor does the mind penetrate there&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_230"></A><A HREF="#fn_227"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The saint&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_231"></A><A HREF="#fn_228"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> knows well that which is without support&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_232"></A><A HREF="#fn_229"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. (3)</p>  
<p>(The liberated) is not long nor small nor round nor triangular nor quadrangular nor circular; he is not black nor blue nor red nor green nor white; neither of good nor bad smell; not bitter nor pungent nor astringent nor sweet; neither rough nor soft; neither heavy nor light; neither cold nor hot; neither harsh nor smooth; he is without body, without resurrection, without contact (of matter), he is not feminine nor masculine nor neuter; he perceives, he knows, but there is no analogy (whereby to know the nature of the liberated soul); its essence is without form; there is no condition of the unconditioned. There is no sound, no colour, no smell, no taste, no touch--nothing of that kind. Thus I say. (4)</p>
