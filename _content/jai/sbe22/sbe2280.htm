<p>The creatures attain only a temporary residence (in one of the four states of being); hearing this supreme truth (i.e. the doctrine of the T&icirc;rthakara's) one should meditate upon it. The wise man should free himself from the family bonds; fearless should he give up acts and attachments. (1)</p>  
<p>A mendicant, living thus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_522"></A><A HREF="#fn_515"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, self-controlled towards the eternal (world of living beings), the matchless sage, who collects his alms, is insulted with words by the people assailing him, like an elephant in battle with arrows. (2)</p>  
<p>Despised by such-like people, the wise man, with undisturbed mind, sustains their words and blows, as a rock is not shaken by the wind. (3) Disregarding (all calamities) he lives together with clever (monks, insensible) to pain and pleasure, not hurting the movable and immovable (beings), not killing, bearing all: so is described the great sage, a good <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a. (4)</p>  
<p>As the lustre of a burning flame increases, so increase the austerity, wisdom, and glory of a steadfast sage who, with vanquished desires, meditates</p>  
<p>

<p>on the supreme place of virtue&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_523"></A><A HREF="#fn_516"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, though suffering pain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_524"></A><A HREF="#fn_517"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. (5)</p>  
<p>The great vows which are called the place of peace, the great teachers, and the producers of disinterestedness have, in all quarters of the earth, been proclaimed by the infinite <I>G</I>ina, the knowing one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_525"></A><A HREF="#fn_518"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, as light, illumining the three worlds, (repels) darkness. (6)</p>  
<p>The unbound one, living amongst the bound (i.e. householders), should lead the life of a mendicant; unattached to women, he should speak with reverence. Not desiring this or the next world, the learned one is not measured by the qualities of love. (7)</p>  
<p>The dirt (of sins) formerly committed by a thus liberated mendicant who walks in wisdom (and restraint), who is constant, and bears pain, vanishes as the dirt covering silver (is removed) by fire. (8)</p>  
<p>He lives, forsooth, in accordance with wisdom (and restraint), and walks free from desire, and with conquered sensuality. As a snake casts off its old skin, so is the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a freed from the bed of pain. (9)</p>  
<p>As they call the great ocean a boundless flood of water, difficult to traverse with the arms (alone), so should the learned one know (and renounce) it (the sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra): that sage is called 'Maker of the end.' (10)</p>  
<p>Here amongst men bondage and deliverance have</p>

<p>been declared; he who, according to that doctrine (of the church), knows bondage and deliverance: that sage is called 'Maker of the end.' (11) He for whom there is no bondage whatever in this world, and besides in the two (other continents, or heaven and hell), is indeed a (monk needing) no support and no standing place; he has quitted the path of births.
