<p>In that period, in that age lived the Arhat Arish<I>t</I>anemi, the five most important moments of whose life happened when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism <I>K</I>itr&acirc;. In <I>K</I>itr&acirc; he descended from heaven, &amp;c. (see &sect; 149, down to) obtained final liberation. (1 70)</p>  
<p>In that period, in that age, in the fourth month of the rainy season, in the seventh fortnight, the dark (fortnight) of K&acirc;rttika, on its twelfth day, the Arhat Arish<I>t</I>anemi descended from the great Vim&acirc;na, called Apar&acirc;<I>g</I>ita, where he had lived for thirty-six S&acirc;garopamas, here on the continent <I>G</I>amb&ucirc;dv&icirc;pa, in Bharatavarsha, in the town of <I>S</I>auripura&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_659"></A><A HREF="#fn_652"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and in the middle of the night when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism <I>K</I>itr&acirc;, he took the form of an embryo in the womb of the queen <I>S</I>iv&acirc;, wife of the king Samudravi<I>g</I>aya, &amp;c. (the seeing of the dreams, the accumulation of riches, &amp;c., should be repeated here). (171)</p>  
<p>In that period, in that age the Arhat Arish<I>t</I>anemi--after the lapse of nine months and seven and a half days, in the first month of the rainy season, in the second fortnight, the light (fortnight) of <I>S</I>r&acirc;va<I>n</I>a, on its fifth day, &amp;c.--(<I>S</I>iv&acirc;), perfectly healthy herself; gave birth to a perfectly healthy boy. (Repeat the account of the birth, substituting the name Samudravi<I>g</I>aya,</p>

<p>The Arhat Arish<I>t</I>anemi, clever, &amp;c. (see &sect;&sect; 155157, all down to) indigent persons. (172) In the first month of the rainy season, in the second fortnight, the light (fortnight) of Sr&acirc;va<I>n</I>a, on its sixth day riding in his palankin called Uttarakur&acirc;, and followed on his way by a train of gods, men, and Asuras, &amp;c. (Arish<I>t</I>anemi) went right through the town of Dv&acirc;r&acirc;vat&icirc; to the park called Revat&icirc;ka, and proceeded to the excellent A<I>s</I>oka tree. There, &amp;c. (see &sect; 116, down to) five handfuls. When the moon was in conjunction with the asterism <I>K</I>itr&acirc;, after fasting two and a half days without drinking water, he put on a divine robe, and together with a thousand persons he tore out his hair, and leaving the house entered the state of houselessness. (173)</p>  
<p>The Arhat Arish<I>t</I>anemi for fifty-four days neglected his body, &amp;c. (see &sect;&sect; 117-120). During the fifty-fifth day--it was in the third month of the rainy season, in the fifth fortnight, the dark fortnight of &Acirc;<I>s</I>vina, on its fifteenth day, in the last part of the day, when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism <I>K</I>itr&acirc;--(Arish<I>t</I>anemi) under a Ve<I>t</I>asa&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_661"></A><A HREF="#fn_654"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> tree on the summit of mount Girn&acirc;r&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_662"></A><A HREF="#fn_655"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, after fasting three and a half days without drinking water, &amp;c., obtained infinite, &amp;c., highest knowledge and intuition called Kevala, &amp;c.

<p>The Arhat Arish<I>t</I>anemi had eighteen Ga<I>n</I>as and eighteen Ga<I>n</I>adharas. (175)</p>  
<p>The Arhat Arish<I>t</I>anemi had an excellent community of eighteen thousand <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>as with Varadatta at their head; (176) forty thousand nuns with &Acirc;rya Yakshi<I>n</I>&icirc; at their head; (177) one hundred and sixty-nine thousand lay votaries with Nanda at their head; (178) three hundred and thirty-six thousand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_663"></A><A HREF="#fn_656"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> female lay votaries with Mah&acirc;suvrat&acirc; at their head; (179) four hundred sages who knew the fourteen P&ucirc;rvas, &amp;c.; (180) fifteen hundred sages who were possessed of the Avadhi knowledge; fifteen hundred Kevalins; fifteen hundred sages who could transform themselves; one thousand sages of vast intellect; eight hundred professors; sixteen hundred sages in their last birth; fifteen hundred male and three thousand female disciples who had reached perfection.</p>  
<p>The Arhat Arish<I>t</I>anemi instituted, &amp;c. (see &sect; 146, down to) the former ended in the eighth generation, the latter in the twelfth year of his Kevaliship. (181)</p>  
<p>In that period, in that age the Arhat Arish<I>t</I>anemi lived three centuries as a prince, fifty-four days in a state inferior to perfection, something less than seven centuries as a Kevalin, full seven centuries as a <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a, a thousand years on the whole. When his fourfold Karman was exhausted and in this Avasarpi<I>n</I>&icirc; era a great part of the Du<I>h</I>shamasusham&acirc; period had elapsed, in the fourth month of summer, in the eighth fortnight, the light (fortnight) of Ash&acirc;<I>dh</I>a, on its eighth day, in the middle of the night when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism <I>K</I>itr&acirc;, (Arish<I>t</I>anemi), after fasting a month</p>

<p>without drinking water, on the summit of mount Girn&acirc;r, in the company of five hundred and thirty-six monks, in a squatting position, died, &amp;c. (all down to) freed from all pains. (182)</p>  
<p>Since the time that the Arhat Arish<I>t</I>anemi died, &amp;c. (all down to) freed from all pains, eighty-four thousand years have elapsed, of the eighty-fifth millennium nine centuries have elapsed, of the tenth century this is the eightieth year. (183)</p>
