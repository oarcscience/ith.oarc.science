#### THIRD LESSON.

'Frequently (I have been born) in a high family, frequently in a low
one; I am not mean, nor noble, nor do I desire (social preferment).'
Thus reflecting, who would brag about his family or about his glory, or
for what should he long? (1)

Therefore a wise man should neither be glad nor angry (about his lot):
thou shouldst know and consider the happiness of living creatures.
Carefully conducting himself, he should mind this: blindness, deafness,
dumbness, one-eyedness,

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

hunchbackedness <span id="fr_125"></span>[1](#fn_124), blackness,
variety of colour (he will always experience); because of his
carelessness he is born in many births, he experiences various feelings.
(2)

Not enlightened (about the cause of these ills) he is afflicted (by
them), always turns round (in the whirl of) birth and death. Life is
dear to many who own fields and houses. Having acquired dyed and
coloured (clothes), jewels, earrings, gold, and women, they become
attached to these things. And a fool who longs for life, and
worldly-minded <span id="fr_126"></span>[2](#fn_125), laments that (for
these worldly goods) penance, self-restraint, and control do not avail,
will ignorantly come to grief. (3)

Those who are of a steady conduct do not desire this (wealth). Knowing
birth and death, one should firmly walk the path (i.e. right conduct),
(and not wait for old age to commence a religious life),

For there is nothing inaccessible for death. All beings are fond of
life <span id="fr_127"></span>[3](#fn_126), like pleasure, hate pain,
shun destruction, like life, long to live. To all life is dear <span
id="fr_128"></span>[4](#fn_127). (4)

Having acquired it (i.e. wealth), employing bipeds and quadrupeds,
gathering riches in the three ways <span
id="fr_129"></span>[5](#fn_128),

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

whatever his portion will be, small or great, he will desire to enjoy
it. Then at one time, his manifold savings are a large treasure. Then at
another time, his heirs divide it, or those who are without a living
steal it, or the king takes it away, or it is ruined in some way or
other, or it is consumed by the conflagration of the house. Thus a fool
doing cruel deeds which benefit another, will ignorantly come thereby to
grief. (5)

This certainly has been declared by the sage <span
id="fr_130"></span>[1](#fn_129). They do not cross the flood <span
id="fr_131"></span>[2](#fn_130), nor can they cross it; they do not go
to the next shore, nor can they go to it; they do not go to the opposite
shore, nor can they go to it.

And though hearing the doctrine, he does not stand in the right place;
but the clever one who adopts the true (faith), stands in the right
place (i.e. control) <span id="fr_132"></span>[3](#fn_131).

He who sees by himself, needs no instruction. But the miserable,
afflicted fool who delights in pleasures, and whose miseries do not
cease, is turned round in the whirl of pains. Thus I say. (6)

<span id="fn_124"></span>[19:1](sbe2212.htm#fr_125) Hereafter
va*d*abhatta*m* explained by vinirgatap*ri*thivi
va*d*abha-laksha*n*a*m*.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[19:2](sbe2212.htm#fr_126) Sa*m*pu*nn*a*m* =
sampûr*n*a*m*, lit. complete, i.e. the complete end of human existence
is enjoyment of the world.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[19:3](sbe2212.htm#fr_127) Another reading
mentioned by the commentator is piyâyayâ, fond of themselves.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[19:4](sbe2212.htm#fr_128) The original of this
paragraph reads partly metrical; after the verse marked in my edition
there follow three final pâdas of a *s*loka.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[19:5](sbe2212.htm#fr_129) According to the
commentators, the three modes of activity (yoga), action, order,
consent, or the three organs of activity (kara*n*a), mind, speech, body,
are meant.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[20:1](sbe2212.htm#fr_130) I.e. the Tîrthakara.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[20:2](sbe2212.htm#fr_131) I.e. the Sa*m*sâra,
represented under the idea of a lake or slough, in the mud of which the
worldly are sinking without being able to reach the shore.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[20:3](sbe2212.htm#fr_132) Ayâ*n*i*gg*a*m* *k*a
âdâya tammi *th*â*n*e na ki*tth*ai \| avitaha*m* pappa kheyanne tammi
*th*â*n*ammi ki*tth*ai \|\| These words form a regular *s*loka, which
has not been noticed by any commentator. Sîlâṅka seems to have read
vitaha*m* pappa akheyanne, but I consider the reading of our MSS.
better, for if we adopt it, *th*â*n*a retains the same meaning (viz.
control) in both parts of the couplet, while if we adopt *S*îlâṅka's
reading, *th*â*n*a must in the one place denote the contrary of what it
means in the other; âdânîya, doctrine, lit. to be adopted.
