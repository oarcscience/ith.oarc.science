<p>He may beg for a domicile in a traveller's hall, &amp;c. (see II, 1, 8, &sect; 2), having reflected (on its fitness); he should ask permission to take possession</p>

<p>of it from the landlord or the steward of that place: 'Indeed, O long-lived one! for the time and in the space you concede us, we shall dwell here&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_450"></A><A HREF="#fn_444"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,' &amp;c. (see 1, &sect; 2). Now what further after the place is taken possession of? He should not remove from without to within, or vice versa, any umbrella or stick, &amp;c. (see II, 2, 3, &sect; 2) belonging to <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>as or Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as (previously settled there); nor should he wake up a sleeping person, nor offend or molest the (inmates). (1)</p>  
<p>A monk or a nun might wish to go to a mango park; they should then ask the landlord's or steward's permission (in the manner described above). Now what further after the place is taken possession of? Then they might desire to eat a mango. If the monk or the nun perceive that the mango is covered with eggs, living beings, &amp;c. (see II, 1, 1, &sect; 2), they should not take it; for it is impure, &amp;c. (2)</p>  
<p>If the monk or the nun perceive that the mango is free from eggs, living beings, &amp;c., but not nibbled at by animals, nor injured, they should not take it; for it is impure, &amp;c. But if they perceive that the mango is free from eggs, living beings, &amp;c., and is nibbled at by animals and injured, then they may take it; for it is pure, &amp;c.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_451"></A><A HREF="#fn_445"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (3)</p>  
<p>The monk might wish to eat or suck one half of a mango or a mango's peel or rind or sap or smaller particles. If the monk or the nun perceive that the above-enumerated things are covered with eggs, or living beings, they should not take them; for they are impure, &amp;c. But they may take them, if they are</p>

<p>free from eggs, &amp;c., and nibbled at by animals or injured&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_452"></A><A HREF="#fn_446"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. (4)</p>  
<p>A monk or a nun might wish to go to a sugarcane plantation. They should ask permission in the manner described above. The monk or the nun might wish to chew or suck sugar-cane. In that case the same rules as for eating mango apply also; likewise if they wish to chew or to suck the sugar-cane's pulp, fibres, sap, or smaller particles. (5)</p>  
<p>A monk or a nun might wish to go to a garlic field. They should ask permission in the manner described above. The monk or the nun might wish to chew or suck garlic. In that case the same rules as for eating mangoes apply also; likewise if they wish to chew or suck the bulb or peel or stalk or seed of garlic&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_453"></A><A HREF="#fn_447"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. (6)</p>  
<p>A monk or a nun, having got possession of a place in a traveller's hall, &amp;c., should avoid all occasions to sin (proceeding from any preparations made by) the householders or their sons, and should occupy that place according to the following rules. (7)</p>  
<p>Now this is the first rule:</p>  
<p>He may beg for a domicile in a traveller's hall, &amp;c., having reflected (on its fitness for a stay), &amp;c. (&sect; 2 of the preceding Lesson is to be repeated here).</p>  
<p>This is the first rule. (8)</p>  
<p>Now follows the second rule:</p>  
<p>A monk resolves: 'I shall ask for possession of a dwelling-place, &amp;c., for the sake of other mendicants,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="green">p. 176</font></A></p>  
<p>and having taken possession of it for their sake, I shall use it.'</p>  
<p>This is the second rule. (9)</p>  
<p>Now follows the third rule:</p>  
<p>A monk resolves: 'I shall ask for possession of a dwelling-place, &amp;c., for the sake of other mendicants, and having taken possession of it for their sake, I shall not use it.'</p>  
<p>This is the third rule. (10)</p>  
<p>Now follows the fourth rule:</p>  
<p>A monk resolves: 'I shall not ask for possession of a dwelling-place, &amp;c., for the sake of other mendicants; but if the dwelling-place, &amp;c., has already been ceded to them, I shall use it.'</p>  
<p>This is the fourth rule. (11)</p>  
<p>Now follows the fifth rule:</p>  
<p>A monk resolves: 'I shall ask for possession of a dwelling-place for my own sake, not for two, three, four, or five persons.'</p>  
<p>This is the fifth rule. (12)</p>  
<p>Now follows the sixth rule:</p>  
<p>If a monk or a nun, occupying a dwelling-place in which there is Ikka<I>d</I>a reed, &amp;c. (see II, 2, 3, &sect; 18), get this thing, then they may use it; otherwise they should remain in a squatting or sitting posture.</p>  
<p>This is the sixth rule. (13)</p>  
<p>Now follows the seventh rule:</p>  
<p>A monk or a nun may beg for a dwelling-place paved with clay or wood. If they get it, then they may use it; otherwise they should remain in a squatting or sitting posture.</p>  
<p>This is the seventh rule.</p>  
<p>One who has adopted one of these seven rules, should not say, &amp;c. (all as in II, 1, 11, &sect; 12). (14)</p>  
<p><a name="page_177"><font size="1" color="green">p. 177</font></A></p>  
<p>I have heard the following explanation by the venerable (Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra): The Sthaviras, the venerable ones, have declared that dominion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_454"></A><A HREF="#fn_448"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is fivefold:</p>  
<p>The lord of the gods' dominion;</p>  
<p>The king's dominion;</p>  
<p>The houseowner's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_455"></A><A HREF="#fn_449"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> dominion;</p>  
<p>The householder's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_456"></A><A HREF="#fn_450"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> dominion;</p>  
<p>The religious man's&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_457"></A><A HREF="#fn_451"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> dominion.</p>  
<p>This is the whole duty, &amp;c.</p>  
<p>Thus I say. (15)</p>
