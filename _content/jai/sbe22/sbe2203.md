### FIRST LECTURE <span id="fr_93"></span>[2](#fn_92),

###### CALLED

###### KNOWLEDGE OF THE WEAPON.

#### FIRST LESSON <span id="fr_94"></span>[3](#fn_93).

O long-lived (*G*ambûsvâmin <span id="fr_95"></span>[4](#fn_94))! I
(Sudharman) have heard the following discourse from the venerable
(Mahâvîra): (1)

Here many do not remember whether they have descended in an eastern
direction (when they were born in this world), or in a southern, or in a
western, or in a northern direction, or in the direction from above, or
in the direction from below, or in a direction intermediate (between the
cardinal points), or in a direction intermediate between these (and the

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

cardinal points). (2) Similarly, some do not know whether their soul is
born again and again or not; nor what they were formerly, nor what they
will become after having died and left this world. (3) Now this is what
one should know, either by one's own knowledge or through the
instruction of the highest (i.e. a Tîrthakara), or having heard it from
others: that he descended in an eastern direction, or in any other
direction (particularised above). Similarly, some know that their soul
is born again and again, that it arrives in this or that direction,
whatever direction that may be. (4) He believes in soul <span
id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_95), believes in the world <span
id="fr_97"></span>[2](#fn_96), believes in reward <span
id="fr_98"></span>[3](#fn_97), believes in action (acknowledged to be
our own doing in such judgments as these): 'I did it;' 'I shall cause
another to do it;' 'I shall allow another to do it <span
id="fr_99"></span>[4](#fn_98).' In the world, these are all the causes
of sin <span id="fr_100"></span>[5](#fn_99), which must be comprehended
and renounced. (5) A man that does not comprehend and renounce the
causes of sin, descends in a cardinal or intermediate direction, wanders
to all cardinal or intermediate directions, is born again and again in
manifold births, experiences all painful feelings. (6) About this the
Revered One has taught

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

the truth (comprehension and renunciation). For the sake of the
splendour, honour, and glory of this life, for the sake of birth, death,
and final liberation, for the removal of pain, all these causes of sin
are at work, which are to be comprehended and renounced in this world.
He who, in the world, comprehends and renounces these causes of sin, is
called a reward-knowing sage (mu*n*i). Thus I say <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_91"></span>[1:1](sbe2203.htm#fr_92) Suyakkha*m*dha,
*s*rutaskandha.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[1:2](sbe2203.htm#fr_93) A*ggh*aya*n*a,
adhyayana. The first lecture is called sattha-pari*nn*â
(*s*astra-pari*gñ*â),'knowledge of the weapon.' Weapons are divided into
material weapon and weapon consisting in a state (bhâva). The latter is
explained to be non-control (asa*m*yama) or the wrong use of mind,
speech, and body. Knowledge (pari*gñ*â) is twofold: comprehension and
renunciation. The subject of the first lecture is, therefore, the
comprehension and renunciation of everything that hurts other beings.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[1:3](sbe2203.htm#fr_94) Uddesaya, udde*s*aka.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[1:4](sbe2203.htm#fr_95) *G*ambûsvâmin was the
disciple of Sudharman, one of the eleven chief disciples (ga*n*adhara)
of Mahâvira.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[2:1](sbe2203.htm#fr_96) I.e. in a permanent
soul, different from the body. This is said against the *K*ârvâkas.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[2:2](sbe2203.htm#fr_97) I.e. the plurality of
souls, not in one all-soul, as the Vedântins.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[2:3](sbe2203.htm#fr_98) Kamma (karma) is that
which darkens our intellect, &c. Its result is the suffering condition
of men, its cause is action (kiriyâ, kriyâ).

<span id="fn_98"></span>[2:4](sbe2203.htm#fr_99) The different tenses
employed in these sentences imply, according to the commentators, the
acknowledgment of the reality of time, as past, present, future.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[2:5](sbe2203.htm#fr_100) Kamma-samâra*m*bha.
Kamma has been explained above. Samâra*m*bha, a special action (kriyâ),
is the engaging in something blamable (sâvadyânush*th*âna).

<span id="fn_100"></span>[3:1](sbe2203.htm#fr_101) These words (tti
bemi) stand at the end of every lesson. The commentators supply them
also for the beginning of each lesson.
