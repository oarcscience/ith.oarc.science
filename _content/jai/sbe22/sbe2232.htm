<p>A sage who is well instructed in the law and leads a life of abstinence, is always a destroyer of the effects of works&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_248"></A><A HREF="#fn_245"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. To a mendicant who is little clothed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_249"></A><A HREF="#fn_246"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and firm in control, it will not occur (to think): My clothes are torn, I shall beg for (new) clothes; I shall beg for thread; I shall beg for a needle; I shall mend (my clothes); I shall darn them; I shall repair them; I shall put them on; I shall wrap myself in them. (1)</p>  
<p>The unclothed one, who excels in this (abstinence), will often be molested by (sharp blades of) grass, by cold, heat, gnats, and mosquitoes. The unclothed one, who effects scarcity (of his wants or of his karman), bears these and various other hardships. He is fit for penance, as has been declared by the Revered One. Understanding this in all respects and with his whole mind, he should perfectly know righteousness. The great heroes (i.e. the T&icirc;rthakaras) who for a long time&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_250"></A><A HREF="#fn_247"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> walked</p>

<p>in the former years&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_251"></A><A HREF="#fn_248"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the worthy ones bore the troubles (mentioned above); endowed with perfect knowledge they had lean arms and very little flesh and blood. He who discontinues (to sin) and is enlightened, is said to have crossed (the sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra), to be liberated, and to have ceased (to act). Thus I say. (2)</p>  
<p>But can discontent lay hold of a mendicant, who has ceased to act and leads a religious life, for a long time controlling himself? He advances in his spiritual career and exerts himself. As an island which is never covered with water, so is the law taught by the noble ones (a safe refuge for those in danger). They are free from desires, free from murder, beloved, wise, learned. For their benefit has been the exertion of the Revered One; as birds (feed) their young ones, so are the disciples regularly to be instructed day and night. Thus I say. (3)</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_246"></A><A HREF="sbe2232.htm#fr_249">57:2</A> A<I>k</I>ela, literally, unclothed. But it has that meaning only when it is applied to a <I>g</I>inakalpika. A <I>g</I>inakalpika is a monk who wears no clothes and uses the hollow of the hand for an alms-bowl. The only implements he has are the broom (ra<I>g</I>ohara<I>n</I>am) and the piece of cloth which the monk places before the mouth while speaking, in order to prevent insects from getting into his mouth (mukhavastrik&acirc;).</P>
