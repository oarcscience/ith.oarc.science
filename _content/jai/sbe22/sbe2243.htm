<p>As I have heard it, I shall tell how the Venerable Ascetic, exerting himself and meditating, after having entered the order in that winter, wandered about&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_301"></A><A HREF="#fn_297"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,</p>  
<p>'I shall not cover myself with that robe&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_302"></A><A HREF="#fn_298"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>,' only in that winter (he used it). He had crossed (the sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra) for the rest of his life. This (refusing of dress) is in accordance with his doctrine. (1)</p>  
<p>More than four months many sorts of living beings gathered on his body, crawled about it, and caused pain there. (2)</p>  
<p>For a year and a month he did not leave off his robe. Since that time the Venerable One, giving up his robe, was a naked, world-relinquishing, houseless (sage)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_303"></A><A HREF="#fn_299"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. (3)</p>  
<p>Then he meditated (walking) with his eye fixed on a square space before him of the length of a</p>

<p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="green">p. 80</font></A></p>  
<p>man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_304"></A><A HREF="#fn_300"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Many people assembled, shocked at the sight; they struck him and cried. (4)</p>  
<p>Knowing (and renouncing) the female sex in mixed gathering places&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_305"></A><A HREF="#fn_301"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, he meditated, finding his way himself: I do not lead a worldly life. (5)</p>  
<p>Giving up the company&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_306"></A><A HREF="#fn_302"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of all householders whomsoever, he meditated. Asked, he gave no answer; he went, and did not transgress the right path. (6)</p>  
<p>For some it is not easy (to do what he did), not to answer those who salute; he was beaten with sticks, and struck by sinful people. (7)</p>  
<p>Disregarding slights difficult to bear, the Sage wandered about, (not attracted) by story-tellers, pantomimes, songs, fights at quarter-staff, and boxing-matches. (8)</p>  
<p>At that time the son of <I>G</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;t<I>ri</I> saw without sorrow (or pleasure) people in mutual conversation. <I>G</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;t<I>ri</I>putra obtained oblivion of these exquisite sorrows. (9)</p>  
<p>For more than a couple of years he led a religious life without using cold water; he realised singleness, guarded his body, had got intuition, and was calm. (10)</p>  
<p>Thoroughly knowing the earth-bodies and water-bodies and fire-bodies and wind-bodies, the lichens, seeds, and sprouts, (11)</p>  
<p>He comprehended that they are, if narrowly</p>

<p>inspected, imbued with life, and avoided to injure them; he, the great Hero. (12)</p>  
<p>The immovable (beings) are changed to movable ones, and the movable beings to immovable ones; beings which are born in all states become individually sinners&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_307"></A><A HREF="#fn_303"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> by their actions. (13)</p>  
<p>The Venerable One understands thus: he who is under the conditions (of existence)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_308"></A><A HREF="#fn_304"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, that fool suffers pain. Thoroughly knowing (karman), the Venerable One avoids sin. (14)</p>  
<p>The sage, perceiving the double (karman)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_309"></A><A HREF="#fn_305"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, proclaims the incomparable activity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_310"></A><A HREF="#fn_306"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, he, the knowing one; knowing the current of worldliness, the current of sinfulness, and the impulse, (15)</p>  
<p>Practising the sinless abstinence from killing, he did no acts, neither himself nor with the assistance of others; he to whom women were known as the causes of all sinful acts, he saw (the true state of the world). (16)</p>  
<p>He did not use what had expressly been prepared for him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_311"></A><A HREF="#fn_307"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>; he well saw (that bondage comes) through action. Whatever is sinful, the Venerable One left that undone: he consumed clean food. (17)</p>  
<p>He did not use another's robe, nor does he eat out of another's vessel. Disregarding contempt, he went with indifference to places where food was prepared. (18)</p>  
<p>Knowing measure in eating and drinking, he was not desirous of delicious food, nor had he a longing for it. A sage should not rub his eyes nor scratch his body. (19)</p>

<p>Looking a little sideward, looking a little behind, answering little when spoken to, he should walk attentively looking on his path. (20)</p>  
<p>When the cold season has half-way advanced, the houseless, leaving off his robe and stretching out his arms, should wander about, not leaning against a trunk. (21)</p>  
<p>This is the rule which has often been followed by the wise Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, the Venerable One, who is free from attachment: thus proceed (the monks).</p>  
<p>Thus I say. (22)</p>
