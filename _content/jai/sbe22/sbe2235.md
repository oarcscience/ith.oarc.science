### SEVENTH LECTURE,

###### CALLED

###### LIBERATION.

#### FIRST LESSON.

I say: To friendly or hostile (heretics) one should not give food,
drink, dainties and spices, clothes, alms-bowls, and brooms; nor exhort
these persons to give (such things), nor do them service, always showing
the highest respect. Thus I say <span id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_258).
(1)

(A heretic may say): Know this for certain: having or not having
received food, &c. (down to) brooms, having or not having eaten (come to
our house), even turning from your way or passing (other houses; we
shall supply your wants). Confessing an individual creed, coming and
going, he may give, or exhort to give, or do service (but one should not
accept anything from him), showing not the slightest respect. Thus I
say. (2)

Some here are not well instructed as regards the subject of conduct; for
desirous of acts, they say: 'Kill creatures;' they themselves kill or
consent to the killing of others; or they take what has not been given;
or they pronounce opinions, e. g. the world exists, the world does not
exist, the world is

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

unchangeable, the world is ever changing; the world has a beginning, the
world has no beginning; the world has an end, the world has no end; (or
with regard to the self and actions): this is well done, this is badly
done; this is merit, this is demerit; he is a good man, he is not a good
man; there is beatitude, there is no beatitude; there is a hell, there
is no hell. When they thus differ (in their opinions) and profess their
individual persuasion, know (that this is all) without reason <span
id="fr_262"></span>[1](#fn_259). Thus they are not well taught, not well
instructed in the religion such as it has been declared by the Revered
One, who knows and sees with quick discernment. (One should either
instruct the opponent in the true faith) or observe abstinence as
regards speech. Thus I say. (3)

Everywhere <span id="fr_263"></span>[2](#fn_260) sins are admitted; but
to avoid them is called my distinction. For ye who live in a village or
in the forest, or not in a village and not in the forest, know the law
as it has been declared. 'By the Brahman, the wise (Mahâvîra),
three <span id="fr_264"></span>[3](#fn_261) vows have been enjoined.'
Noble and tranquil men who are enlightened and exert themselves in these
(precepts), are called free from sinful acts. (4)

Knowing (and renouncing) severally and singly

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

the actions against living beings, in the regions above, below, and on
the surface, everywhere and in all ways--a wise man neither gives pain
to these bodies, nor orders others to do so, nor assents to their doing
so. Nay, we abhor those who give pain to these bodies. Knowing this, a
wise man should not cause this or any other pain (to any creatures).
Thus I say. (5)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_258"></span>[62:1](sbe2235.htm#fr_261) This and the
following paragraph are extremely difficult to translate. I have
translated the words according to the scholiast, and supplied what he
supplies; but his interpretation can scarcely be reconciled with the
text.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[63:1](sbe2235.htm#fr_262) The *G*ainas do not
espouse one of the alternative solutions of the metaphysical and ethical
questions; but they are enabled by the syâdvâda to believe in the
co-existence of contrary qualities in one and the same thing.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[63:2](sbe2235.htm#fr_263) In all other
religious sects.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[63:3](sbe2235.htm#fr_264) *G*âma = yâma. These
are, (1) to kill no living being, (2) to speak no untruth, (3) to
abstain from forbidden things (theft and sexual pleasures). Or the three
ages of man are intended by *g*âma, which we have rendered vows.
