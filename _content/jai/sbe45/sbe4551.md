### SECOND CHAPTER.

A monk, living single <span id="fr_809"></span>[3](#fn_803), should not
fall in love; if he loves pleasures, he should again become indifferent.
Now hear the pleasures of *S*rama*n*as, which some monks enjoy. (1)

When a monk breaks the law, dotes (on a woman), and is absorbed by that
passion, she afterwards

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

scolds him <span id="fr_810"></span>[1](#fn_804), lifts her foot, and
tramples on his head. (2)

'O monk, if you will not live with me as a woman who has still her hair,
I shall tear it out; but do not live separated from me.' (3)

But when they have captured him, they send him on all sorts of
errands <span id="fr_811"></span>[2](#fn_805): 'Look (for the bodkin to)
carve the bottle-gourd <span id="fr_812"></span>[3](#fn_806), fetch some
nice fruit. (4)

'(Bring) wood to cook the vegetables, or that we may light a fire at
night; paint my feet <span id="fr_813"></span>[4](#fn_807), come and
meanwhile rub my back! (5)

'Look after my clothes, bring food and drink, get me some perfume, a
broom, a barber <span id="fr_814"></span>[5](#fn_808) (to shave my
head)! (6)

'Give me the collyrium-box, my ornaments, the lute, Lôdhra-powder <span
id="fr_815"></span>[6](#fn_809), a Lôdhra-flower, the
Vê*n*upalâsika-lute <span id="fr_816"></span>[7](#fn_810), a pill! (7)

'A Utpalakush*t*a <span id="fr_817"></span>[8](#fn_811), Tagara <span
id="fr_818"></span>[9](#fn_812)-powder, and aloe pounded together with
U*s*îra <span id="fr_819"></span>[10](#fn_813), oil for anointing the

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

face, baskets of bamboo wickerwork to put my things in! (8)

'Reach me the lip-salve, fetch the umbrella and slippers, the knife to
cut the string, have my robe dyed bluish! (9)

'Give me the pot to cook the vegetables in, Myrobalans <span
id="fr_820"></span>[1](#fn_814), the jar to fetch water in, the stick to
paint the mark upon the forehead, the pin to apply collyrium (to the
eyelids), or the fan when it is hot! (to)

'Fetch me the pincers <span id="fr_821"></span>[2](#fn_815), the comb,
the ribbon to bind up the hair, reach me the looking-glass, put the
tooth-brush near me! (11)

'Fetch me areca-nut and betel, needle and thread, the chamber-pot, the
winnowing basket, the mortar, the pot for liquefying natron <span
id="fr_822"></span>[3](#fn_816)! (12)

'Give me the vessel (used in worshipping the gods <span
id="fr_823"></span>[4](#fn_817)), the water-pot. Friend, dig a privy.
Fetch the bow for our son, the bullock for the *S*râma*n*êra! (13)

'The small pot, the drum, and the ball of cloth for the boy (to play
with). *S*rama*n*a, the rainy season is at hand, look after the house
and the stores! (14)

'(Fetch) the chair with woven twine seat <span
id="fr_824"></span>[5](#fn_818), the wooden shoes <span
id="fr_825"></span>[6](#fn_819) to walk on!' Pregnant women order

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

their husbands about like slaves to fulfil their craving. (15)

When a son, the reward (of their wedded life), is born, (the mother bids
the father) to hold the baby, or to give it her. Thus some supporters of
their sons have to carry burdens like camels. (16)

Getting up in the night they lull the baby asleep <span
id="fr_826"></span>[1](#fn_820) like nurses; and though they are ashamed
of themselves, they wash the clothes like washermen <span
id="fr_827"></span>[2](#fn_821). (17)

This has been done by many men who for the sake of pleasures have
stooped so low; they become the equals of slaves, animals, servants,
beasts of burden--mere nobodies. (18)

One should not mind the entreaties of women, but abstain from their
friendship and company. These pleasures which are derived therefrom are
called causes of blamable actions. (19)

Restraining himself by the thought that these dangerous (pleasures) will
not be to his benefit, a monk should abstain from women, and commit no
unnatural crime <span id="fr_828"></span>[3](#fn_822). (20)

A wise and learned monk whose soul is in a pure condition (Lê*s*yâ),
will abstain from doing work for others; in thoughts, words, and actions
he will bear all troubles. (21)

The hero (of faith) who has vanquished sin and delusion, has said all
this. A monk, therefore, whose soul is pure (and free from sins) should
wander about till he reaches final liberation. (22)

Thus I say.
