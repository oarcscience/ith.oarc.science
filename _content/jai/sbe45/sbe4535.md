### THIRTY-THIRD LECTURE.

###### THE NATURE OF KARMAN.

I shall now in due order explain the eight kinds of Karman, bound by
which the soul turns round and round in the Circle of Births. (1)

The eight kinds of Karman are briefly the following:

1\. *Gñ*ânâvara*n*îya (which acts as an obstruction to right knowledge);

2\. Dar*s*anâvara*n*îya (which acts as an obstruction to right faith);

3\. Vêdanîya (which leads to experiencing pain or pleasure);

4\. Môhanîya (which leads to delusion);

5\. Âyu*h*karman (which determines the length of life);

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

6\. Nâman (which determines the name or individuality of the embodied
soul);

7\. Gôtra (which determines his Gôtra);

8\. Antarâya (which prevents one's entrance on the path that leads to
eternal bliss <span id="fr_541"></span>[1](#fn_538)). (2, 3)

1\. Obstruction of knowledge is fivefold (viz. obstruction to):

*a*. *S*ruta, knowledge derived from the sacred books;

*b*. Âbhinibôdhika, perception;

*c*. Avadhi*gñ*âna, supernatural knowledge;

*d*. Mana*h*paryâya, knowledge of the thoughts of other people;

*e*. Kêvala, the highest, unlimited knowledge. (4)

2\. The nine kinds of obstruction to right faith are: 1. sleep; 2.
activity; 3. very deep sleep; 4. a high degree of activity <span
id="fr_542"></span>[2](#fn_539); 5. a state of deep-rooted greed; 6-9
refer to faith in the objects of the first three and the last kinds of
knowledge. (5, 6)

3\. Vêdanîya is twofold, pleasure and pain; there are many subdivisions
of pleasure and so there are of pain also. (7)

4\. Môhanîya is twofold as referring to faith and to conduct; the first
is threefold, the second twofold. (8)

The three kinds of Môhanîya referring to faith are: 1. right faith; 2.
wrong faith; 3. faith partly right and partly wrong. (9)

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

The two kinds of Môhanîya referring to conduct are: 1. what is
experienced in the form of the four cardinal passions; 2. what is
experienced in the form of feelings different from them. (10)

The first kind of this Karman is sixteenfold, the second sevenfold or
ninefold <span id="fr_543"></span>[1](#fn_540). (11)

5\. Âyushka is fourfold as referring to 1. denizens of hell; 2. brute
creation; 3. men; 4. gods. (12)

6\. Nâman is twofold, good and bad; there are many subdivisions of the
good variety, and so there are of the bad one also <span
id="fr_544"></span>[2](#fn_541). (13)

7\. Gôtra is twofold, high and low; the first is eightfold, and so is
the second also. (14)

8\. Antarâya is fivefold as preventing: 1. gifts; 2. profit; 3.
momentary enjoyment; 4. continuous enjoyment <span
id="fr_545"></span>[3](#fn_542); and 5. power. (15)

Thus the division of Karman and the subdivisions have been told.

Now hear their number of atoms <span id="fr_546"></span>[4](#fn_543),
place, time, and development. (16)

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

The number of atoms of every Karman is infinite; it is (infinitely)
greater than (the number) of fettered <span
id="fr_547"></span>[1](#fn_544) souls, but less than that of the
perfected ones. (17)

The Karman in the six directions of space <span
id="fr_548"></span>[2](#fn_545) binds all souls, and it binds the whole
soul in all its parts in every possible way. (18)

The longest duration (of Karman) is thirty Krores of Krores of
Sâgarôpamâs <span id="fr_549"></span>[3](#fn_546), and the shortest a
part of a muhûrta. (19)

This holds good with both Âvara*n*îyas, with Vêdanîya and Antarâya. (20)

The longest duration of Môhanîya is seventy Krores of Krores of
Sâgarôpamâs, and the shortest a part of a muhûrta. (21)

The longest duration of Âyushka is thirty-three Krores of Krores of
Sâgarôpamâs, and the shortest a part of a muhûrta. (22)

The longest duration of Nâman and Gôtra is twenty Krores of Krores of
Sâgarôpamâs, and the shortest eight muhûrtas. (23)

The number of perfected souls is infinite, and that

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

of the subdivisions of Karman <span id="fr_550"></span>[1](#fn_547) is
also (infinite); the number of atoms in all these (subdivisions) exceeds
(the number) of all souls. (24)

Therefore a wise man should know the different subdivisions of these
Karmans, and should exert himself to prevent and to destroy them. (25)

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_538"></span>[193:1](sbe4535.htm#fr_541) Compare Bhandarkar,
Report, p. 93, note \*.

<span id="fn_539"></span>[193:2](sbe4535.htm#fr_542) Nos. 1-4 are nidrâ,
pra*k*alâ, nidrânidrâ, pra*k*alâpra*k*alâ; I render the etymological
meaning of these words. According to the Dîpikâ, however, they have a
different meaning: nidrâ means the state of agreeable waking; pra*k*alâ,
the slumber of a standing or sitting person; nidrânidrâ, deep sleep;
pra*k*alâpra*k*alâ, sleep of a person in motion. Nos. 6 and 7 are here
called *k*akkhu and a*k*akkhu, instead of âbhinibôdhika and *s*ruta.

<span id="fn_540"></span>[194:1](sbe4535.htm#fr_543) The divisions of
the second Karman are the feelings or emotions enumerated in the 102nd
verse of the last lecture, from disgust onward. There are seven of them,
if desire for women, men, or both, is reckoned as one item, but nine, if
it is reckoned as three. The sixteen divisions of the Karman produced by
the cardinal passions are arrived at by subdividing each of the four
passions with reference to 1. anantânubandha; 2. pratyâkhyâna; 3.
apratyâkhyâna; 4. sa*mg*valana.

<span id="fn_541"></span>[194:2](sbe4535.htm#fr_544) In the Dîpikâ 103
subdivisions are enumerated; they correspond to our genera.

<span id="fn_542"></span>[194:3](sbe4535.htm#fr_545) 3. Bhôga, 4.
upabhôga; bhôga is enjoyment of flowers, food, &c.; upabhôga, that of
one's house, wife, &c. The Karman in question brings about an
obstruction to the enjoyment, &c., though all other circumstances be
favourable.

<span id="fn_543"></span>[194:4](sbe4535.htm#fr_546) The Karman is
considered to consist, like other substances, of atoms, here called
pradê*s*a point. The word I have translated <span id="page_195">p.
195</span> number of atoms is paêsagga*m* = pradê*s*âgram, which is
rendered paramâ*n*uparimâ*n*a.

<span id="fn_544"></span>[195:1](sbe4535.htm#fr_547) Ga*nth*iyasatta =
granthigasattva.

<span id="fn_545"></span>[195:2](sbe4535.htm#fr_548) The six directions
of space are the four cardinal points, zenith and nadir. The
commentators quote scripture that êkêndriyas, or beings with one organ
of sense, are bound by Karman in three and more directions. The true
meaning of this statement is beyond my grasp.--The Dîpikâ explains how
Karman acts on the soul. The soul absorbs all material particles of a
suitable nature (especially the karmapudgalas) with which it comes into
contact, i.e. all that are in the same space with the soul, and
assimilates them in the form of *gñ*ânâvaranîya, &c., just as fire
consumes everything within its reach, but nothing beyond it.

<span id="fn_546"></span>[195:3](sbe4535.htm#fr_549) I.e.
3,000,000,000,000,000 Sâgarôpamâs.

<span id="fn_547"></span>[196:1](sbe4535.htm#fr_550) Anubhâga, explained
karmarasavi*s*êsha.
