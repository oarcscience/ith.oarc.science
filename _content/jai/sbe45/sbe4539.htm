<p>One should know what causes the bondage of Soul, and knowing (it) one should remove&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_676"></A><A HREF="#fn_672"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> it.</p>  
<p>(<I>G</I>amb&ucirc;sv&acirc;min asked Sudharman):</p>  
<p>What causes the bondage (of Soul) according to Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra? and what must one know in order to remove it? (1)</p>  
<p>(Sudharman answered):</p>  
<p>He who owns even a small property in living or lifeless things&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_677"></A><A HREF="#fn_673"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, or consents to others holding it, will not be delivered from misery. (2)</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_236"><font size="1" color="green">p. 236</font></A></p>  
<p>If a man kills living beings, or causes other men to kill them, or consents to their killing them, his iniquity will go on increasing. (3)</p>  
<p>A sinner who makes the interests of his kinsmen&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_678"></A><A HREF="#fn_674"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and companions his own, will suffer much; for the number of those whose interest he takes to heart constantly increases. (4)</p>  
<p>All this, his wealth and his nearest relations, cannot protect him (from future misery); knowing (this) and (the value of) life, he will get rid of Karman. (5)</p>  
<p>Some men&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_679"></A><A HREF="#fn_675"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>as and Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, who ignore and deny these true words&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_680"></A><A HREF="#fn_676"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, adhere (to their own tenets), and are given to pleasures. (6)</p>  
<p>Some&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_681"></A><A HREF="#fn_677"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> profess (the exclusive belief in) the five gross elements: earth, water, fire, wind, and air. (7)</p>  
<p>'These five gross elements (are the original causes of things), from them arises another (thing, viz. &acirc;tman)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_682"></A><A HREF="#fn_678"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>; for on the dissolution of the (five elements) living beings cease to exist. (8)</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_237"><font size="1" color="green">p. 237</font></A></p>  
<p>'And as the Earth, though it is but one pile, presents many forms, so the intelligent (principle, viz. the &acirc;tman) appears under various forms as the universe&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_683"></A><A HREF="#fn_679"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' (9)</p>  
<p>Thus say some fools. (But how can they explain on their theory that) the man engaging in undertakings, who has committed a sin, will himself suffer severe pain.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_684"></A><A HREF="#fn_680"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>? (10)</p>  
<p>'Everybody, fool or sage, has an individual soul. These souls exist (as long as the body), but after death they are no more; there are no souls which are born again. (11)</p>  
<p>'There is neither virtue nor vice, there is no world beyond; on the dissolution of the body the individual ceases to be.' (12)</p>  
<p>'When a man acts or causes another to act, it is not his soul (&acirc;tman) which acts or causes to act&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_685"></A><A HREF="#fn_681"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.' Thus they (viz. the adherents of the S&acirc;&#7749;khya philosophy) boldly proclaim. (13)</p>  
<p>How can those who hold such opinions explain (the variety of existence in) the world? They go from darkness to utter darkness, being fools and engaged in works. (14)</p>  
<p>Some&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_686"></A><A HREF="#fn_682"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> say that there are five elements and that</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_238"><font size="1" color="green">p. 238</font></A></p>  
<p>the soul is a sixth (substance), but they contend that the soul and the world (i.e. the five elements) are eternal. (15)</p>  
<p>'These (six substances) do not perish neither (without nor with a cause); the non-existent does not come into existence, but all things are eternal by their very nature&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_687"></A><A HREF="#fn_683"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' (16)</p>  
<p>Some fools&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_688"></A><A HREF="#fn_684"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> say that there are five skandhas of momentary existence. They do not admit that (the soul) is different from, nor identical&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_689"></A><A HREF="#fn_685"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> with (the elements), that it is produced from a cause (i.e. the elements), nor that it is without a cause (i.e. that it is eternal). (17)</p>  
<p>The <I>G</I>&acirc;<I>n</I>ayas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_690"></A><A HREF="#fn_686"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> say that there are four elements: earth, water, fire, and wind, which combined form the body (or soul?). (18)</p>  
<p>(All these heretics say): 'Those who dwell in houses, in woods, or on hills, will be delivered from all misery if they adopt our creed.' (19)</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_239"><font size="1" color="green">p. 239</font></A></p>  
<p>But they do not cross the Flood of Life, who, ignoring the true relation of things, and not versed in the true Law, hold the above heretical opinions. (20)</p>  
<p>They do not reach the end of the Sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra, who, ignoring, &amp;c. (21)</p>  
<p>They do not reach the end of transmigration, who, &amp;c. (22)</p>  
<p>They do not put an end to birth, who, &amp;c. (23)</p>  
<p>They do not put an end to misery, who, &amp;c. (24)</p>  
<p>They do not put an end to death, who, &amp;c. (25)</p>  
<p>They will again and again experience manifold pains in this ring&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_691"></A><A HREF="#fn_687"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the earth, which is full of death, disease, and old age. (26)</p>  
<p>The highest <I>G</I>ina, Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra the <I>G</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;t<I>ri</I>putra, has said that they will undergo births without number, being placed in all sorts of existences. (27)</p>  
<p>Thus I say.</p>

I think that the word may be derived from y&acirc;na 'vehicle,' which the Buddhist used to designate the two sections of the church, viz. the H&icirc;nay&acirc;na and Mah&acirc;y&acirc;na schools. The commentator quotes a various reading: &acirc;var&ecirc; for <I>g</I>&acirc;<I>n</I>ay&acirc;, and explains it as referring to another sect of Bauddhas than those spoken of in the preceding verse. <I>S</I>&icirc;l&acirc;&#7749;ka comments on the reading avvar&ecirc; first, and then on <I>g</I>&acirc;<I>n</I>aya.</P>
