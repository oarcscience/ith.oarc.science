### FOURTH CHAPTER.

Some say that in old times great men, rich in religious penance, have
reached perfection though they drank (cold) water (and ate fruits and
roots). Ignorant men (who hear such assertions) are led astray (by
them). (1)

'Nami, the king of Vidêha, ate nothing, Râmagupta did eat, Bâhuka drank
(cold) water, and so did Târâga*n*a <span
id="fr_791"></span>[3](#fn_785), the seer. (2)

Âsila, Dêvala, the great sage Dvîpâyana, and

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pârâ*s*ara did
drink (cold) water, and did eat seeds and sprouts <span
id="fr_792"></span>[1](#fn_786). (3)

'I have heard that in old times these renowned and well-known great men
ate seeds and drank water, and have reached perfection.' (4)

When weak (monks hear such assertions) they become disheartened, as
donkeys break down under their burden; in case of danger they retreat
(and perish) like men who walk on crutches <span
id="fr_793"></span>[2](#fn_787). (5)

Some <span id="fr_794"></span>[3](#fn_788) say: Pleasant things are
produced from pleasant things <span id="fr_795"></span>[4](#fn_789).
(They are those who disdain) the noble path and the renowned highest
good. (6)

Do not, by disdaining it, lose much for the sake of little. If you do
not give up this (wrong law), you will repent of it as the man did who
carried iron (a long way) believing it to be silver. (7)

(And so will) those who kill living beings, who do not abstain from
untrue speech, who take what is not freely given them, who enjoy sexual
pleasures, and who own property. (8)

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

Some unworthy heretics <span id="fr_796"></span>[1](#fn_790), slaves of
women, ignorant men who are averse to the Law of the *G*inas, speak
thus: (9)

'As the squeezing of a blister or boil (causes relief) for some time,
(and has no dangerous consequences), so it is with (the enjoyment of)
charming women. How could there be any sin in it? (10)

'As a ram drinks the quiet water <span id="fr_797"></span>[2](#fn_791),
so, &c. (the rest as in verse 10). (11)

'As the bird Piṅga <span id="fr_798"></span>[3](#fn_792) drinks the
quiet water (flying), &c. (the rest as in verse 10).' (12)

So say some unworthy heretics who entertain false doctrines, and who
long for pleasures, as the ewe <span id="fr_799"></span>[4](#fn_793) for
her kid. (13)

Those who do not think of the future, but only enjoy the present, will
repent of it afterwards when their life or their youth is gone. (14)

But those who exert themselves at the proper time, feel no remorse
afterwards; these heroes who have got rid of their fetters, do not long
for life. (15)

As Vaitara*n*î, the river (of hell), is difficult to pass, so in this
world women are to the unwise (a temptation) difficult to overcome. (16)

Those who have given up intercourse with women

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

and have left off adorning themselves, are well established in control,
because they have renounced everything. (17)

As merchants go over the sea, so they will cross the flood (of
Sa*m*sâra), where living beings despond and suffer pains because of
their own deeds. (18)

A monk who knows this, will live as a virtuous man guarded by the
Samitis; he will abstain from untrue speech, and not take what is not
freely given him. (19)

He should cease to injure living beings whether they move or not, on
high, below, and on earth. For this has been called the Nirvâ*n*a, which
consists in peace <span id="fr_800"></span>[1](#fn_794). (20)

21, 22 = I, 3, 3, 20 and 21.

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_785"></span>[268:3](sbe4549.htm#fr_791) Concerning Nami,
see above, [p. 35](sbe4510.htm#page_35), note [2](sbe4511.htm#fn_130).
Râmagupta may be another name of Râma. Instead of Târâga*n*a *S*îlâṅka
writes Nârâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_786"></span>[269:1](sbe4549.htm#fr_792) Âsila is not known
from other sources; perhaps Asita is meant, and Âsila Davila stands for
Asita Dêvala. Concerning Dvîpâyana, the Pârâ*s*ara, compare Journal of
the German Oriental Society, vol. 42, p. 495. But in the Aupapâtika
Sûtra (ed. Leumann, § 76) Pârâ*s*ara and Dvîpâyana are two distinct
persons.

<span id="fn_787"></span>[269:2](sbe4549.htm#fr_793) Pî*dh*asappî =
pî*th*asarpin. *S*îlâṅka comments on the reading pi*tth*asappî, i.e.
p*ri*sh*t*asarpin; but he makes out no good meaning.

<span id="fn_788"></span>[269:3](sbe4549.htm#fr_794) According to the
commentators the Buddhists are intended. They quote some verses in
illustration of the push*t*imârga of the Buddhists, one of which is not
yet known I believe. It runs thus: ma*n*u*nn*a*m* bhôya*n*a*m* bhu*kk*â
ma*n*u*nn*a*m* saya*n*âsa*n*a*m* \| ma*n*u*nn*a*m*si agâra*m*si
ma*n*u*nn*a*m* *gh*âyae mu*n*î \|\| 'Having enjoyed a pleasant dinner,
and a pleasant seat and bed, a mu*n*i in a pleasant house meditates on
pleasant things.'

<span id="fn_789"></span>[269:4](sbe4549.htm#fr_795) Viz. Môksha, a
pleasant thing, is arrived at through a comfortable life, another
pleasant thing.

<span id="fn_790"></span>[270:1](sbe4549.htm#fr_796) Pâsattha =
pâr*s*vastha.

<span id="fn_791"></span>[270:2](sbe4549.htm#fr_797) The meaning seems
to be that by the ram's drinking the water is not disturbed.

<span id="fn_792"></span>[270:3](sbe4549.htm#fr_798) Explained by
kapi*ñg*ala, the francoline partridge.

<span id="fn_793"></span>[270:4](sbe4549.htm#fr_799) Pûya*n*â (pûtana,
who is ever desirous of young), explained either by *s*âkinî hog' or
ga*dd*arikâ 'ewe.' The commentators relate the following anecdote. In
order to find out which animal loved its young ones best, their young
ones were placed at the bottom of a well. Their mothers assembled round
the brink and howled, but the ewe threw herself recklessly into the
well. Therefore the ewe excels the other animals in maternal love.

<span id="fn_794"></span>[271:1](sbe4549.htm#fr_800) See below, I, 11,
11.
