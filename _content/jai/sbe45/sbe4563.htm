<p>What is past, present, and to come, all this is known to the Leader, the Saviour, who annihilates the hindrances to right faith. (1)</p>  
<p>The annihilator of doubt knows the incomparable (Law); he, the expounder of the incomparable (Law), is not inclined towards this or that (heretical doctrine). (2).</p>  
<p>On this or that (article of the creed he has) the correct opinion; hence he is rightly called a true (man); he who always possesses the truth, is kind towards his fellow-creatures. (3)</p>  
<p>Towards your fellow-creatures be not hostile: that is the Law of him who is rich in control; he who is rich in control renounces everything, and in this (world meditates on the) reflections on life&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_969"></A><A HREF="#fn_962"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. (4)</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_330"><font size="1" color="green">p. 330</font></A></p>  
<p>He whose soul is purified by meditating on those reflections is compared to a ship in water; like a ship reaching the shore he gets beyond misery. (5)</p>  
<p>A wise man gets beyond it who knows the sins of this world; sinful acts are got rid of by him who does not undertake any new acts. (6)</p>  
<p>He who does not undertake new acts does not acquire Karman, and he verily understands (Karman); understanding it he becomes a Great Hero&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_970"></A><A HREF="#fn_963"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, who is not born (again) and does not die. (7)</p>  
<p>A Great Hero, who has no Karman, does not die.--As the wind extinguishes a light, (so he puts down) the lovely women in this world. (8)</p>  
<p>Those men whom women do not seduce, value M&ocirc;ksha most; those men are free from bondage and do not desire life. (9)</p>  
<p>Turning from worldly life, they reach the goal by pious acts; by their pious acts they are directed (towards Liberation), and they show the way to others. (10)</p>  
<p>The preaching of the Law (has different effect) on different creatures; he who is rich in control, is. treated with honour&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_971"></A><A HREF="#fn_964"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, but does not care for it; he exerts himself, subdues his senses, is firm, and abstains from sexual intercourse. (i1)</p>  
<p>(He should not yield to temptations as a pig which) is decoyed by wild rice, being proof against sins, and free from faults. Being free from faults he always</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_331"><font size="1" color="green">p. 331</font></A></p>  
<p>subdues his senses, and has reached the incomparable cession of Karman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_972"></A><A HREF="#fn_965"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. (12)</p>  
<p>Knowing the incomparable (control), he should not be hostile towards anybody, in thoughts, words, or deeds, having eyes (to see everything). (13)</p>  
<p>He truly is the eye of men who (dwells so to speak) on the end&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_973"></A><A HREF="#fn_966"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of desire; on its end (i.e. edge) glides the razor, on its end (i.e. rim) rolls the wheel. (14)</p>  
<p>Because the wise use the ends (of things, i.e. bad food, &amp;c.), they are called 'makers of an end' here. Here in the world of men we are men to fulfil the Law. (15)</p>  
<p>In this creed which surpasses the world, (men) become perfected saints or gods, as I have heard; and I have heard that outside the rank of men this is not so&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_974"></A><A HREF="#fn_967"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. (16)</p>  
<p>Some (heretics) have said that they (viz. the gods) put an end to misery&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_975"></A><A HREF="#fn_968"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; but others (<I>G</I>ainas) have repeatedly said that this (human) body is not easily obtained. (17)</p>  
<p>To one whose soul has left (human life), it is not easy again to obtain instruction (in the Law), nor is such a mental disposition which they declare appropriate for adopting the Law&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_976"></A><A HREF="#fn_969"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. (18)</p>  
<p>How can it even be imagined that he should</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_332"><font size="1" color="green">p. 332</font></A></p>  
<p>be born again, who professes the pure, complete, unparalleled Law, and is a receptacle of the unparalleled Law? (19)</p>  
<p>How could the wise Tath&acirc;gatas be born again, the Tath&acirc;gatas who engage in no undertakings, the supreme, the eyes of the world? (20)</p>  
<p>And there has been declared by the K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa the supreme condition&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_977"></A><A HREF="#fn_970"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, by realising which some happy and wise men reach excellence. (21)</p>  
<p>A wise man who has gained strength (in control) which leads to the expiation of sins, annihilates his former works, and does not do new ones. (22)</p>  
<p>The Great Hero does no actions which are the effects of former sins. By his actions he is directed (towards M&ocirc;ksha), abstaining from works which are entailed by birth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_978"></A><A HREF="#fn_971"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. (23)</p>  
<p>That which all saints value highly (viz. control), destroys the thorn (viz. Karman); practising it some have been liberated, and others have become gods. (24)</p>  
<p>There have been wise men, and there will be pious men, who having come to the end and made manifest the end of the incomprehensible path, have been liberated. (25)</p>  
<p>Thus I say.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_961"></A><A HREF="sbe4563.htm#fr_968">329:1</A> This lecture has been named from its opening words <I>g</I>ama&icirc;yam, which also means, consisting of yamakas (compare Journal of the German Oriental Society, vol. xl, p. 101). For in this lecture each verse or line opens with a word repeated from the end of the preceding one. This artifice is technically called <I>s</I><I>ri</I>&#7749;khala-yamaka, or chain-yam aka, a term which seems to be contained in another name of our lecture, mentioned by the author of the Niryukti (verse 28), viz. &acirc;d&acirc;niya-sa&#7749;kaliy&acirc;. For sa&#7749;kaliy&acirc; is the Pr&acirc;k<I>ri</I>t for <I>s</I><I>ri</I>&#7749;khala (e.g. in our text I, 5, 2, 20), though <I>S</I>&icirc;l&acirc;&#7749;ka here renders it wrongly sa&#7749;kalita; and &acirc;d&acirc;niya by itself is used as a name of our lecture.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_966"></A><A HREF="sbe4563.htm#fr_973">331:2</A> There is a play on the word 'end' in this and the next verse which to a modern mind savours more of the absurd than the profound.</P>
