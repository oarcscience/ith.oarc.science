### THIRD CHAPTER.

If a monk should eat forbidden food which a pious (layman) has prepared
for some guest, and which food has been mixed up with even thousand
(times more

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

pure food) <span id="fr_709"></span>[1](#fn_705), he would be neither
monk nor layman. (1)

*S*rama*n*as who do not comprehend this and do not know what is
dangerous, who care for the pleasures of the moment only, will suffer
death an endless number of times, like big <span
id="fr_710"></span>[2](#fn_706) fishes who when the water rises are by
the water (deposited) on dry land and are killed (there), poor things,
by hungry *dh*aṅkas and herons. (2-4)

We hear also of another error of some (philosophers): some say that the
world has been created (or is governed) <span
id="fr_711"></span>[3](#fn_707) by the gods, others, by Brahman. (5)
Some <span id="fr_712"></span>[4](#fn_708) say that it has been created
by the Î*s*vara, others that it was produced from chaos, &c., this world
with living beings and lifeless things, with its variety of pleasure and
pain. (6)

The great *Ri*shi <span id="fr_713"></span>[5](#fn_709) said, that the
world has been created by Svayambhû; Mâra originated Mâyâ, therefore the
world (appears to be) uneternal. (7)

Some Brâhma*n*as and *S*rama*n*as say that the

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

universe was produced from the (primeval) egg, and He (Brahman) created
the things. These ignorant men speak untruth. (8)

Those who on arguments of their own maintain that the world has been
created, do not know the truth. Nor will (the world) ever perish. (9)

Know that misery arises from wicked deeds <span
id="fr_714"></span>[1](#fn_710). How can those who do not know the
origin (of misery) know its prevention? (10)

Some say that the soul (of him who is) pure will become free from bad
Karman (on reaching beatitude), but that in that state it will again
become defiled through pleasant excitement or hate. (11)

(According to them <span id="fr_715"></span>[2](#fn_711)) he who has
lived on earth as a restrained monk, will afterwards become free from
Karman. As clear water which was free from defilement becomes again
defiled, so (will be the soul). (12)

A wise man should consider that these (heretics) do not lead a life of
chastity, and that all these disputants proclaim their own creed in
opposition (to the others). (13)

(Others <span id="fr_716"></span>[3](#fn_712) maintain that) perfection
can only be reached by their method of religious life, not otherwise;
and that even before (that time) they have

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

their senses under control and possess everything to be wished for <span
id="fr_717"></span>[1](#fn_713). (14)

Some say that they will be perfected and sound.

On the head of Perfection some men are infatuated with their own
doctrines. (15)

But these uncontrolled (men) will whirl round in the beginningless
(Circle of Births); after a Kalpa they will rise from their sphere to
become the lowest of Asuras <span id="fr_718"></span>[2](#fn_714). (16)

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_705"></span>[244:1](sbe4541.htm#fr_709) This might also be
translated: 'though the food passes through the hands of a thousand men
before he accepts it.'

<span id="fn_706"></span>[244:2](sbe4541.htm#fr_710) Vêsâliya =
vai*s*âlika. The commentators offer three explanations of this word, (1)
marine, vi*s*âla*h* samudras tatrabhavâ*h*; (2) belonging to the genus
called vi*s*âla; (3) big, vi*s*âla.

<span id="fn_707"></span>[244:3](sbe4541.htm#fr_711) Dêvauttê. This is
either dêvair upta*h*, sown, i.e. produced by the gods, or dêvair
gupta*h*, governed by the gods.

<span id="fn_708"></span>[244:4](sbe4541.htm#fr_712) The adherents of
the Yôga and Sâṅkhya philosophy, or the theistical and atheistical
followers of the latter, are apparently meant by 'some' and 'others.'

<span id="fn_709"></span>[244:5](sbe4541.htm#fr_713) The commentators
unfortunately have not preserved the name of the great *Ri*shi; they
identify Svayambhû with Vish*n*u 'or some one else.' This Svayambhû,
afraid that the earth should become overcrowded, called to help Yama,
alias Mâra, who with the help of Mâyâ makes the creatures appear to die.

<span id="fn_710"></span>[245:1](sbe4541.htm#fr_714) It is not given us
by any of the above-mentioned agents whom the opponents believe to have
created the world.

<span id="fn_711"></span>[245:2](sbe4541.htm#fr_715) According to
*S*îlâṅka the followers of Gô*s*âla and the Trairâ*s*ikas are meant. The
latter are the *G*aina followers of the Vai*s*êshika philosophy. The
Trairâ*s*ika *S*âkhâ was founded by *Kh*aluka Rôhagupta, see part i, p.
290. The name Trairâ*s*ika is said to have been given to these
philosophers because they admit a third state besides those of the bound
and of the liberated.

<span id="fn_712"></span>[245:3](sbe4541.htm#fr_716) According to
*S*îlâṅka the *S*aivas and Ekada*nd*ins are meant.

<span id="fn_713"></span>[246:1](sbe4541.htm#fr_717) They acquire the
eight siddhis or magical powers.

<span id="fn_714"></span>[246:2](sbe4541.htm#fr_718) I translate the
words *th*â*n*â âsurakivvisiyâ according to the explanation of the
commentary. But they may also mean: from the sphere of Asuras and
sinners.
