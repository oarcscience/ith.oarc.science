## THIRD LECTURE,

###### CALLED

###### THE KNOWLEDGE OF TROUBLES <span id="fr_772"></span>[2](#fn_766)

### FIRST CHAPTER.

A man believes himself a hero as long as he does not behold the foe, as
did *S*i*s*upâla (before he beheld) the valorously-fighting, great
warrior <span id="fr_773"></span>[3](#fn_767). (1)

They go forward to the head of the battle; but when the fight has begun
the mother will not recognise her son, and he will be mangled by his
foe. (2)

So a novice, who as yet has not suffered pains and is not yet used to a
mendicant's life, believes himself a hero till he practises
austerities <span id="fr_774"></span>[4](#fn_768). (3)

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

When during the winter they suffer from cold and draughts, the weak
become disheartened like Kshattriyas who have lost their kingdom. (4)

When they suffer from the heat of summer, sad and thirsty, the weak
become disheartened like fish in shallow water. (5)

It is painful never to take anything but what is freely given, and
begging is a liard task. Common people say that (men become monks)
because they will not work and are wretched. (6)

Weak men who are unable (to bear) these insults in villages or towns,
become disheartened like cowards in the battle. (7)

Perchance a snarling dog will bite a hungry monk; in that case the weak
will become disheartened like animals burnt by fire. (8)

Some who hate (the monks), revile them: 'Those who lead such a
(miserable) life (as monks do), atone but (for their sins in a former
life).' (9)

Some call them names, as 'naked, lowest of beggars, baldhead, scabby,
filthy, nasty.' (10)

Those who behave in this way and do not know better, go from darkness to
utter darkness, being fools and shrouded in delusion <span
id="fr_775"></span>[1](#fn_769). (11)

When bitten by flies and gnats, and unable (to bear) the pricking of
grass, (they will begin to doubt), 'I have not seen the next world, all
may end with death <span id="fr_776"></span>[2](#fn_770)!' (12)

Some weak men who suffer from the plucking out of the hair, and who are
unable to preserve their chastity, will become disheartened like fish
transfixed by a spear <span id="fr_777"></span>[3](#fn_771). (13)

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

Some low people who lead a life of iniquity, and entertain heretical
opinions, being subject to love and hatred, injure a monk. (14)

Some fools in outlying countries take a pious monk for a spy or a thief,
bind him, and insult him with angry words. (15)

A weak monk being hurt with a stick or a fist or a fruit, remembers his
(kind) relations, just as a woman who in a passion has left (her husband
and house). (16)

All these hardships are difficult to bear; the weak return to their
house (when they cannot bear them), like elephants covered with arrows
(break down). (17)

Thus I say.
