<p>A very clever (monk) who practises the vow of chastity, should not adopt the following (heretical) doctrines, nor behave badly in this religion. (1)</p>  
<p>He should not believe that (this world) is without beginning or without end, eternal or not eternal, according to the argumentation (of heretics)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1194"></A><A HREF="#fn_1184"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. (2) From these alternatives you cannot arrive at</p>

<p>truth; from these alternatives you are, certainly, led to error. (3)</p>  
<p>One should not say: that there will be an end of beings who (know and) teach the truth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1195"></A><A HREF="#fn_1185"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; nor that all beings are not alike, nor that they shall be in (perpetual) bondage, or (that the prophets are) eternal. (4)</p>  
<p>From these alternatives you cannot arrive at the truth, &amp;c. (see verse 3). (5)</p>  
<p>One should not say: the guilt of killing small and great animals is the same, or not the same. (6) From these alternatives, &amp;c. (7)</p>  
<p>One should know that those who accept things especially prepared for them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1196"></A><A HREF="#fn_1186"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, will be affected by demerit (in some cases), or will not be affected (where it is allowed by scripture). (8)</p>  
<p>From these alternatives, &amp;c. (9)</p>  
<p>One should not maintain the identity of the aud&acirc;rika&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1197"></A><A HREF="#fn_1187"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, &acirc;h&acirc;rika, and k&acirc;rma<I>n</I>a bodies, nor</p>

<p>that everything cannot everywhere come into existence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1198"></A><A HREF="#fn_1188"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, nor that it can. (10)</p>  
<p>From these alternatives, &amp;c. (11)</p>  
<p>Do not maintain that the world does not exist, maintain that it exists. (12)</p>  
<p>Do not maintain that <I>G</I>&icirc;va and A<I>g</I>&icirc;va do not exist, but that they exist. (13)</p>  
<p>Do not maintain that Dharma and Adharma do not exist, but that they exist. (14)</p>  
<p>Do not maintain that bondage and liberation do not exist, but that they exist. (15)</p>  
<p>Do not maintain that virtue and vice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1199"></A><A HREF="#fn_1189"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> do not exist, but that they exist. (16)</p>  
<p>Do not maintain that &Acirc;srava and the stoppage of &Acirc;srava do not exist, but that they exist. (17)</p>  
<p>Do not maintain that the experiencing of the effect, and the annihilation of Karman do not exist, but that they exist. (18)</p>  
<p>Do not maintain that activity and non-activity do not exist, but that they exist. (19)</p>

<p>Do not maintain that anger and pride do not exist, but that they exist. (20)</p>  
<p>Do not maintain that deceit and greed do not exist, but that they exist. (21)</p>  
<p>Do not maintain that love and hate do not exist, but that they exist. (22)</p>  
<p>Do not maintain that the fourfold Circle of Births does not exist, but that it exists. (23)</p>  
<p>Do not maintain that there are no gods and goddesses, but that there are. (24)</p>  
<p>Do not maintain that there is no such thing as perfection and non-perfection, but that there is such a thing. (25)</p>  
<p>Do not maintain that there is no place exclusively reserved for those who attain to perfection, but that there is such&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1200"></A><A HREF="#fn_1190"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. (26)</p>  
<p>Do not maintain that there are no pious and wicked men, but that there are. (27)</p>  
<p>Do not maintain that there is no such thing as good and bad, but that there is good and bad. (28)</p>  
<p>The theory will not work that (a man is always) good, or (always) bad. The wrongly instructed <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>as do not comprehend the (soul's) bondage&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1201"></A><A HREF="#fn_1191"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (through Karman). (29)</p>  
<p>(Do not assert) that everything is imperishable, or full of pains, nor that criminals should be put to death or not be put to death; one should not speak in this way. (30)</p>  
<p>Do not assert that those men are well-behaved monks who lead a pure life, and that those others lead an impure life. (31)</p>

<p>A wise monk should not say: we get alms (from this householder) or we do not; but he should improve his chances for final liberation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1202"></A><A HREF="#fn_1192"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. (32)</p>  
<p>A monk should conform himself to these opinions taught by the <I>G</I>inas, and wander about till he reaches final liberation. (33)</p>  
<p>Thus I say.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1184"></A><A HREF="sbe4569.htm#fr_1194">405:1</A> The <I>G</I>ainas decide all such questions with the help of the sy&acirc;dv&acirc;da, which in an admirable way removes all difficulties; e.g. the world is eternal as far as that part is concerned which is <a name="page_406"><font size="1" color="green">p. 406</font></A> the substratum of the idea (s&acirc;m&acirc;nya) 'world'; it is not eternal as far as its ever-changing state is meant.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1185"></A><A HREF="sbe4569.htm#fr_1195">406:1</A> <I>S</I>&acirc;st&acirc;ra<I>h</I>, teachers, here those who reach perfection. The meaning is that the world would become empty if all beings should reach perfection. This should not he maintained, nor the opposite opinion, that some beings are qualified for Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a and others not.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1186"></A><A HREF="sbe4569.htm#fr_1196">406:2</A> Ah&acirc;kamm&acirc;<I>n</I>i, see <A HREF="sbe4526.htm#page_131">p. 131</A>, note <A HREF="sbe4526.htm#fn_337">7</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1187"></A><A HREF="sbe4569.htm#fr_1197">406:3</A> The <I>G</I>ainas assume that each individual possesses five bodies: (1) aud&acirc;rika, or the body that is seen; (2) k&acirc;rma<I>n</I>a, receptacle of Karman, it is composed of Karman particles; (3) tai<I>g</I>asa, a body composed of particles of fire, it causes digestion; (4) &acirc;h&acirc;raka, a subtile body of the soul, with which he goes to distant places (e.g. when a <I>k</I>aturda<I>s</I>ap&ucirc;rvin goes to the K&ecirc;valin to clear up some doubt); (5) vaikriya, a subtile body which can be changed at will. All these 'bodies,' except the first, are what in common language are called spirits or souls. We have here a Hindu counterpart of the belief in the plurality of souls shared <a name="page_407"><font size="1" color="green">p. 407</font></A> by many ancient and modern nations. Compare the following verses quoted in Tylor, Origin of Culture, Chapter XI:</p>  
<p><DIR>'Bis duo sunt homini, manes, caro, spiritus, umbra:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quattuor haec loci bis duo suscipiunt.<br> Terra tegit carnem, tumulum circumvolution umbra<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manes Orcus habet, spiritus astra petit.'</DIR></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> I am inclined to believe that the idea of the &acirc;h&acirc;raka and vaikriya <I>s</I>ar&icirc;ras is developed from the popular belief that the soul in sleep leaves the body and travels far away. Compare also the S&acirc;&#7749;khya terms vaik<I>ri</I>ta and tai<I>g</I>asa, Garbe, Die S&acirc;<I>m</I>khya-Philosophie, pp. 236, 249.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1188"></A><A HREF="sbe4569.htm#fr_1198">407:1</A> According to the commentator this is said against the S&acirc;&#7749;khya philosophy, for as everything is an effect of Prak<I>ri</I>ti, and Prak<I>ri</I>ti is present everywhere, everything may come into existence everywhere.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1189"></A><A HREF="sbe4569.htm#fr_1199">407:2</A> Pu<I>n</I>yam and p&acirc;pam. The one is the good Karman (<I>s</I>ubham karmapudgalam); the other, the bad.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1190"></A><A HREF="sbe4569.htm#fr_1200">408:1</A> See Uttar&acirc;dhyayana XXXVI, 62, 63, p. 212.</P>
