### SECOND CHAPTER.

Again some <span id="fr_692"></span>[2](#fn_688) say: 'It is proved that
there are individual souls; they experience pleasure and pain; and (on
dying) they lose their state of life. (1)

'But misery (and pleasure) is not caused by (the souls) themselves; how
could it be caused by other (agents, as time, &c.)? Pleasure and misery,
final beatitude <span id="fr_693"></span>[3](#fn_689) and temporal
(pleasure and pain) are not

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

caused by (the souls) themselves, nor by others; but the individual
souls experience them; it is the lot assigned them by destiny.' This is
what they (i.e. the fatalists) say. (2, 3)

Those who proclaim these opinions, are fools who fancy themselves
learned; they have no knowledge, and do not understand that things
depend partly on fate, and partly on human exertion <span
id="fr_694"></span>[1](#fn_690). (4)

Thus (say) some heretics <span id="fr_695"></span>[2](#fn_691); they are
very bold men; if they act up to their principles, they will never be
delivered from misery. (5)

As the swift deer who are destitute of protection, are frightened where
there is no danger, and not frightened where there is danger; (6)

(As) they dread safe places, but do not dread traps; they are bewildered
by ignorance and fear, and run hither and thither; (7)

If they did jump over the noose or pass under it, they would escape from
the snare; but the stupid animal does not notice <span
id="fr_696"></span>[3](#fn_692) it; (8)

The unhappy animal, being of a weak intellect, runs into the dangerous
(place), is caught in the snare, &c., and is killed there; (9)

So some unworthy *S*rama*n*as who hold wrong doctrines are afraid of
what is free from danger, and are not afraid of real dangers. (to)

The fools dread the preaching of the Law, but

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

they do not dread works, being without discernment and knowledge. (11)

Shaking off greed <span id="fr_697"></span>[1](#fn_693), pride <span
id="fr_698"></span>[2](#fn_694), deceit <span
id="fr_699"></span>[3](#fn_695), and wrath <span
id="fr_700"></span>[4](#fn_696), one becomes free from Karman. This is a
subject (which an ignorant man, like) a brute animal, does not attend
to. (12)

The unworthy heretics who do not acknowledge this, will incur death an
endless number of times, like deer caught in a snare. (13)

All Brâhma*n*as and *S*rama*n*as contend that they possess the knowledge
(of the truth), but the creatures in the whole world do not know
anything. (14)

As a Mlê*kkh*a <span id="fr_701"></span>[5](#fn_697) repeats what an
Ârya has said, but does not understand the meaning, merely repeating his
words, so the ignorant, though pretending to possess knowledge, do not
know the truth, just as an uninstructed Mlê*kkh*a. (15, 16)

The speculations of the Agnostics cannot lead to knowledge; they cannot
reach the truth by themselves, still less teach it to other men. (17)

As when a man in a wood who does not know it, follows a guide who also
does not know it, both being unacquainted (with the place), come to
great trouble; (18)

As when one blind man is the guide of another, the man walks a great
distance, loses his way, or follows a wrong way; (19)

Thus some who search after salvation and pretend

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

to practise the (true) Law, follow the false Law and do not arrive at
the thoroughly right (thing, viz. self-control). (20)

Thus some (wrong philosophers) do not apply to others for arguments, but
they continue to err because they believe their own arguments to be
right <span id="fr_702"></span>[1](#fn_698). (21)

Thus arguing according to their light, and ignorant about what is right
and wrong, they do not get out of misery as birds do not get out of
their cage. (22)

They praise their own creed and blame that of their opponents, but those
who act in this respect the part of philosophers, will be kept confined
in the Circle of Births <span id="fr_703"></span>[2](#fn_699). (23)

There is the doctrine of the Kriyâvâdins <span
id="fr_704"></span>[3](#fn_700), which has been previously explained; it
augments the misery of worldly existence of those who do not well
consider the nature of acts. (24)

'He who intends (to kill) a living being but does not do it by (an act
of) his body, and he who unknowingly kills one, both are affected by
that act through a slight contact (with it) only, but the demerit (in
their case) is not fully developed <span
id="fr_705"></span>[4](#fn_701).' (25)

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

'There are three ways of committing sins: by one's own activity, by
commission, by approval (of the deed). (26)

'These are the three ways of committing sins. Thus by purity of the
heart one reaches Nirvâ*n*a. (27)

'A layman may kill his son (during a famine) and eat him; a wise (monk)
who partakes of the meat, will not be defiled by the sin <span
id="fr_706"></span>[1](#fn_702).' (28)

The mind of those who sin in thoughts is not pure; they are wrong, they
do not conduct themselves carefully <span
id="fr_707"></span>[2](#fn_703). (29)

Men attached to pleasure, who think that the above-mentioned doctrines
will save them, commit sins. (30)

As a blind-born man getting into a leaky boat, wants to reach the shore,
but is drowned during the passage <span id="fr_708"></span>[3](#fn_704),
so some unworthy, heretical *S*rama*n*as wish to get beyond the Circle
of Births, but they are whirled round in it. (31, 32)

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_688"></span>[239:2](sbe4540.htm#fr_692) They are the
fatalists whose peculiar opinions are stated in verses 2 and 3.

<span id="fn_689"></span>[239:3](sbe4540.htm#fr_693) Sêhiya*m* =
saiddhikam, i.e. môkshê bhava*m* sukham. Another explanation of the
commentator makes saiddhika those pleasures which depend on external
causes, as wreaths, sandal, &c., and asaiddhika the pleasures of the
mind.

<span id="fn_690"></span>[240:1](sbe4540.htm#fr_694) To render
niyatâniyata*m*.

<span id="fn_691"></span>[240:2](sbe4540.htm#fr_695) Pâsattha, usually
translated pâr*s*vastha 'outsider,' those who do not acknowledge true
arguments; another rendering is pâ*s*astha 'held in bondage.'

<span id="fn_692"></span>[240:3](sbe4540.htm#fr_696) Dêhati = pa*s*yati.
The form dekkhati occurs in the Prâk*ri*t of plays.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[241:1](sbe4540.htm#fr_697) Savvappaga =
sarvâtmaka, lôbha.

<span id="fn_694"></span>[241:2](sbe4540.htm#fr_698) Viukkassa =
vyutkarsha, mâna.

<span id="fn_695"></span>[241:3](sbe4540.htm#fr_699) Nûma = mâyâ.

<span id="fn_696"></span>[241:4](sbe4540.htm#fr_700) Appattiya = krôdha.

<span id="fn_697"></span>[241:5](sbe4540.htm#fr_701) It is worthy of
note that the Mlê*kkh*as here are represented as not understanding the
language of the Âryas.

<span id="fn_698"></span>[242:1](sbe4540.htm#fr_702) The last part of
the verse might also be translated: 'because these fools believe the
subject to be cleared up (ma*ñg*û) by their own arguments.'

<span id="fn_699"></span>[242:2](sbe4540.htm#fr_703) There is a play on
the words viussanti and viussiyâ, in the last line of this verse
viussanti is a denominative verb from viusa = vidvân, and is translated
vidvân ivâ *k*arati. Viussiya = vi + ut + *s*rita.

<span id="fn_700"></span>[242:3](sbe4540.htm#fr_704) See above, [p.
83](sbe4520.htm#page_83). *S*îlâṅka defines the Kriyâvâdins here as men
who contend that the principal means of reaching Môksha is
*k*aityakarma, the construction of sanctuaries.

<span id="fn_701"></span>[242:4](sbe4540.htm#fr_705) An intentional
killing of a living being must actually take place in order to induce
the Karman on the soul. If one of the essential conditions which
constitute the guilt of slaughter (hi*m*sâ), <span id="page_243">p.
243</span> is wanting the Karman is still produced; however, it does not
take a firm hold of the soul, but merely 'touches' it. This is of course
the opinion of the Kriyâvâdins.

<span id="fn_702"></span>[243:1](sbe4540.htm#fr_706) According to
*S*îlâṅka the father too would not be guilty; but this interpretation is
against good sense and grammar.

<span id="fn_703"></span>[243:2](sbe4540.htm#fr_707) This is the answer
of the Siddhântin to the foregoing propositions.

<span id="fn_704"></span>[243:3](sbe4540.htm#fr_708) The same verse
recurs below, I, 11, 30.
