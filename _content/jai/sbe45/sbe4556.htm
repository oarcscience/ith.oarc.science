<p>It is said that two definitions of exertion are given; but in what does the exertion of the virtuous consist, and how is it defined? (1)</p>  
<p>Some say that it consists in works, and the pious (say that it consists) in abstention from works. Men appear divided into two classes from this point of view. (2)</p>  
<p>Carelessness is called (the cause of) Karman, carefulness that of the contrary (viz. absence of Karman); when the one or the other is predicated</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_298"><font size="1" color="green">p. 298</font></A></p>  
<p>(of a man, he is called) either a fool or a wise man. (3)</p>  
<p>Some learn sciences&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_885"></A><A HREF="#fn_878"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> which teach the destruction of living beings, others study spells for killing all sorts of creatures. (4)</p>  
<p>Deceivers practise deceit in order to procure themselves pleasures and amusement; they kill, cut, and dismember (beings) for the sake of their own comfort. (5)</p>  
<p>The careless (commit sins) by thoughts, words, and acts, with regard to this and the next world, both (by doing the act themselves and by making others do it). (6)</p>  
<p>A cruel&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_886"></A><A HREF="#fn_879"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> man does cruel acts and is thereby involved in other cruelties; but sinful undertakings will in the end bring about misery. (7)</p>  
<p>Sinners, subject to love and hate and doing wrong, acquire Karman arising from passions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_887"></A><A HREF="#fn_880"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and commit many sins. (8)</p>  
<p>Thus the 'exertion leading to works' of the sinners has been described; now learn from me the wise men's 'exertion not leading to works.' (9)</p>  
<p>A pious monk, who is free from bonds and has severed all fetters, annihilates his bad Karman, and removes definitely the thorn (of sin). (to)</p>  
<p>Following the right doctrine he exerts himself; as one becomes more and more the receptacle</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_299"><font size="1" color="green">p. 299</font></A></p>  
<p>of misery, so his bad thoughts (or sinfulness) increase. (11)</p>  
<p>Those who have good places (in heaven, &amp;c.) must surely leave them (some time). We live together with relations and friends but a limited time. (12)</p>  
<p>Considering this, a wise man should conquer his greed, and enter upon the noble (path), which contains all virtues and is not blamed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_888"></A><A HREF="#fn_881"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. (13)</p>  
<p>Whether he know the pith of the Law by intuition or through instruction, a houseless (monk) should exert himself and abstain from sins. (14)</p>  
<p>When a wise man, in whatever way, comes to know that the apportioned space of his life draws towards its end, he should in the meantime quickly learn the method (of dying a religious death)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_889"></A><A HREF="#fn_882"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. (15)</p>  
<p>As a tortoise draws its limbs into its own body, so a wise man should cover, as it were, his sins with his own meditation. (16)</p>  
<p>He should draw in, as it were, his hands and feet, his mind and five organs of sense, the effect of his bad Karman, and every bad use of language. (17)</p>  
<p>The virtuous exert themselves with regard to the distant end (viz. Liberation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_890"></A><A HREF="#fn_883"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>). One should live</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_300"><font size="1" color="green">p. 300</font></A></p>  
<p>indifferent to one's own happiness, calm, and without any attachment. (18)</p>  
<p>Do not kill living beings, do not take what is not freely given, do not talk false, treacherous speech! This is the Law of him who is rich in control. (19)</p>  
<p>Do not desire by words or thoughts what is a transgression (of the Law); guarding yourself in all ways, and subduing (the senses), practise control. (20)</p>  
<p>A man who guards his self and subdues his senses, abhors all sins, past, present, and future ones. (21)</p>  
<p>Benighted men of wrong faith, (though) they be renowned as heroes, exert themselves in a bad way, which will have, in all respects, evil consequences for them. (22)</p>  
<p>Wise men of right faith, who are renowned heroes, exert themselves in a good way which will have no (evil) consequences whatever for them. (23)</p>  
<p>Penance is of no good if performed by noble men who have turned monks (for the sake of fame); but that penance of which nobody else knows anything (is meritorious). Do not spread your own fame&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_891"></A><A HREF="#fn_884"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>! (24)</p>  
<p>A pious man should eat little, drink little, talk little; he should always exert himself, being calm, indifferent, a subduer (of his senses), and free from greed. (25)</p>  
<p>Meditating and performing religious practices,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_301"><font size="1" color="green">p. 301</font></A></p>  
<p>abandoning his body, regarding forbearance as the paramount duty, a monk should wander about till he obtains liberation. (26)</p>  
<p>Thus I say.</p>
