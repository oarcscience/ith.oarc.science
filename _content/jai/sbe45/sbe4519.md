### SEVENTEENTH LECTURE.

###### THE BAD *S*RAMA*N*A.

A Nirgrantha who has entered the order, who has learned the Law, who has
received religious

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

discipline, and who has obtained the benefit of Bôdhi which is difficult
to obtain, may perhaps afterwards begin to live as he likes. (1)

(He will say:) I have a good bed and wherewithal to cover me; I obtain
food and drink; I know everything that comes to pass, friend; why then
should I study, sir? (2)

He who, after entering the order, always sleeps, eats, and drinks as
much as he likes, and lives comfortably, is called a bad *S*rama*n*a.
(3)

The sinner who despises the learning and discipline which his preceptor
and teachers have taught him, is called a bad *S*rama*n*a. (4)

He who does not, as he should, strive to please his preceptor and
teachers, and does not, in his arrogance, treat them with respect, is
called a bad *S*rama*n*a. (5)

He who hurts living beings, seeds, and sprouts, who does not control
himself, though he believes himself well-controlled, is called a bad
*S*rama*n*a. (6)

He who uses a bed, a plank, a chair, a seat, or his duster <span
id="fr_205"></span>[1](#fn_204), without having well wiped these things,
is called a bad *S*rama*n*a. (7)

He who walks with great haste and without care, being overbearing and
fierce, is called a bad *S*rama*n*a. (8)

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

He who carelessly inspects things <span id="fr_206"></span>[1](#fn_205),
throwing down his duster at random, not being attentive to the
inspection of things, is called a bad *S*rama*n*a. (9)

He who carelessly inspects things, his attention being absorbed by what
he hears, who always slights his teachers, is called a bad *S*rama*n*a.
(to)

He who is deceitful, talkative, arrogant, greedy, who does not control
himself, nor share (his food, &c. with those who are in want), and is
not of an amiable disposition, is called a bad *S*rama*n*a. (11)

He who is a controversialist, and ill-behaved, who perverts the truth,
and delights in quarrels and contentions, is called a bad *S*rama*n*a.
(12)

He who sits down on a weak, shaking seat wherever he lists, and is not
careful in sitting down, is called a bad *S*rama*n*a. (13)

He who sleeps with dusty feet and does not inspect his couch, being
careless about his bed, is called a bad *S*rama*n*a. (14)

He who eats milk, curds, and other things produced from milk, and does
not practise austerities, is called a bad *S*rama*n*a. (15)

He who eats after sunset, and when admonished, makes an angry reply, is
called a bad *S*rama*n*a. (16)

He who leaves his own teacher, and follows heretical ones, who
continuously changes his school <span id="fr_207"></span>[2](#fn_206),
being of a bad disposition, is called a bad *S*rama*n*a. (17)

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

He who has left his own house, and busies himself in another's house,
who lives by fortune-telling, is called a bad *S*rama*n*a. (18)

He who eats the food of his relations, and does not like living by
alms <span id="fr_208"></span>[1](#fn_207), who reposes on the seat of
the householder, is called a bad *S*rama*n*a. (19)

Such a monk, who, like the heretics <span
id="fr_209"></span>[2](#fn_208), does not protect himself from sins, who
though having the appearance (of a monk) is the lowest among his worthy
brethren, is despised in this world like poison; he is nobody in this
world and in that beyond. (20)

But he who always avoids these sins, and is pious amongst his brethren,
is welcomed in this world like nectar; he conquers this world and the
next <span id="fr_210"></span>[3](#fn_209). (21)

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_204"></span>[78:1](sbe4519.htm#fr_205) Pâdakambala, usually
called ra*g*ôhara*n*a. One commentator suggests, as a possible
rendering, pâtrakambala 'a cloth to cover his almsbowl.'

<span id="fn_205"></span>[79:1](sbe4519.htm#fr_206) It is a monk's duty
closely to inspect everything that he uses or comes in contact with, in
order to avoid hurting inadvertently anything considered to possess
life. This is called pa*d*ilêhâ.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[79:2](sbe4519.htm#fr_207) Gâ*n*a*m*ga*n*ika,
according to the commentators one who attaches himself to another ga*n*a
every half-year.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[80:1](sbe4519.htm#fr_208) Sâmudâ*n*iya,
explained bhaiksham.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[80:2](sbe4519.htm#fr_209) Pa*ñk*aku*s*îla,
literally, those who practise the five wrong *s*îlas, whereby probably
those are denoted who do not keep the five great vows of the *G*ainas.
Note that the Buddhists too have their pa*ñk*a*s*îla. They could
therefore have been called pa*ñk*aku*s*îla by the *G*ainas.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[80:3](sbe4519.htm#fr_210) The text is not
settled in the last line; but there can be no doubt about the meaning.
