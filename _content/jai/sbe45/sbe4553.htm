<p>I shall now truly tell you another kind of perpetual suffering, how the sinners who have committed crimes suffer for the deeds they have done in their former lives. (1)</p>  
<p>Tying their hands and feet the (punishers) cut open their belly with razors and knives; taking hold of the mangled body of the sinner, they forcibly tear the skin off his back. (2)</p>  
<p>They cut off his arms at the armpits; they force his mouth wide open and scald it; they yoke the sinner to a car and drive him, and growing angry&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_840"></A><A HREF="#fn_834"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> they pierce his back with a goad. (3)</p>  
<p>The (sinners) walk over ground burning and glowing like red-hot iron; scorched they shriek horribly, being urged on with arrows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_841"></A><A HREF="#fn_835"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and put to a red-hot yoke. (4)</p>  
<p>The sinners are driven over slippery ground which is like a road of red-hot iron; in this dreadful place (the ministers of hell) make them go forward like slaves (beating them) with sticks. (5)</p>  
<p>Proceeding in this intolerable (hell) they are crushed by rocks tumbling down. There is the</p>

<p>They throw the sinners into caldrons and boil them; scalded they rise thence again; devilish crows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_843"></A><A HREF="#fn_837"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> feed on them and (so do) other beasts having claws devour them. (7)</p>  
<p>There is a place of smokeless fire in the form of a pile&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_844"></A><A HREF="#fn_838"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> where (the sinners) greatly distressed shriek horribly; head downwards they are lacerated and cut into pieces with iron knives. (8)</p>  
<p>Tied up and skinned they are devoured by steel-nebbed birds; it is the hell called Sa<I>m</I><I>g</I>&icirc;van&icirc;, where life is long, and where men of an evil mind are tortured. (9)</p>  
<p>The (punishers) pierce them with sharp pikes as people do with a captured pig. Transfixed by a pike the (sinners) shriek horribly; suffering both (bodily and mentally) they feel nothing but pains. (10)</p>  
<p>There is a great place always on fire, where fires burn without fuel; there for a long time stay the evildoers shrieking aloud. (11)</p>  
<p>Setting on fire large piles, they thrust into them (a sinner) who will cry horribly; as butter thrown in the fire melts, so does the evildoer there. (12)</p>  
<p>And there is an always crowded, hot place which one deserves for one's great sins, and which is full of misery. There (the punishers) tie (the sinner's)</p>

<p>hands and feet, and belabour him with sticks like an enemy. (13)</p>  
<p>They break the sinner's back with a weapon, and smash his skull with iron clubs; their bodies are split and sawn like a plank; and tortured with red-hot awls (the sinners) are subjected (to cruelties). (14)</p>  
<p>Cruel evildoers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_845"></A><A HREF="#fn_839"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, urged on with arrows, and put to work (by the punishers), carry burdens in the way of elephants; two or three (punishers) get on one (victim) and growing angry&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_846"></A><A HREF="#fn_840"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> hurt his vital parts. (15)</p>  
<p>The sinners are driven over the large, slippery, and thorny ground; tightly bound with straps&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_847"></A><A HREF="#fn_841"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> they lose their senses; the revenging (punishers) cut them into pieces&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_848"></A><A HREF="#fn_842"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and throw them about like a bali-sacrifice. (16)</p>  
<p>There is a dreadful mountain towering high up in the air, called Vait&acirc;lika&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_849"></A><A HREF="#fn_843"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, where the evildoers are tortured for more than a thousand hours. (17)</p>  
<p>Tortured, the sinners shriek, suffering day and night; in this horrid, great hell, which is full of implements of torture, they are put to a cruel death. (18)</p>  
<p>Full of wrath, like their enemies in a former life,</p>

<p>There are the ever hungry&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_850"></A><A HREF="#fn_844"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, savage, always wrathful, great jackals by whom the evildoers bound with shackles are devoured. (20)</p>  
<p>There is the dreadful, slimy river, which is always flowing and full of molten iron; in this very dreadful river (the sinners) must descend one by one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_851"></A><A HREF="#fn_845"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. (21)</p>  
<p>These pains are suffered without interruption by the sinner who stays there for a long time. There is no escape from the torture; he must, himself and alone, suffer the pains. (22)</p>  
<p>Whatever cruelty he has done in a former birth, the same will be inflicted on him in the Circle of Births. Having been born in an extremely miserable state of life, the sufferer experiences infinite pain. (23)</p>  
<p>A wise man hearing of these hells should not kill any living being in the whole world; believing in true doctrines and renouncing all property he should know the world, but not become a slave to it. (24)</p>  
<p>Knowing the endless Circle of Births&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_852"></A><A HREF="#fn_846"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> with regard to animals, men, and gods, and the reward they will get; knowing all this, (a wise man) should wait for his decease, practising meanwhile self-control. (25)</p>  
<p>Thus I say.</p>
