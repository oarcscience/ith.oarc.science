<p>'Listen, &Acirc;rdraka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1204"></A><A HREF="#fn_1194"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, to what (Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra) has done. At first he wandered about as a single monk; but now he has surrounded himself by many monks, and teaches every one of them the Law at length. (1)</p>

<p>'The inconstant man has decided upon this mode of life&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1205"></A><A HREF="#fn_1195"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: to stand up in a crowd of men, surrounded by monks, and to teach his doctrines for the benefit of many people. Therefore his former and his present life are not of a piece. (2)</p>  
<p>'Either to live as a single mendicant (was right conduct) or his present life; therefore both do not agree with each other.'</p>  
<p align="center">&Acirc;rdraka.</p>  
<p>"His past, present, and future lives agree with each other; for he is really always single and alone (though he be now surrounded by many followers). (3)</p>  
<p>"For if a <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a or Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a who causes peace and security, comprehends the nature of movable and immovable living beings and explains it in a crowd numbering thousands, he realises singleness, remaining in the same mental condition as before&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1206"></A><A HREF="#fn_1196"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. (4)</p>  
<p>"It is no sin to teach the Law, if (he who teaches it) is patient and resigned, subdues his senses, avoids bad speech, and uses virtuous speech. (5)</p>  
<p>"He who (teaches) the great vows (of monks) and the five small vows (of the laity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1207"></A><A HREF="#fn_1197"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>), the five &Acirc;sravas and the stoppage of the &Acirc;sravas, and control, who avoids Karman in this blessed life of <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>as, him I call a <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a."

<p>('As your Law makes it no sin for Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra to surround himself by a crowd of disciples), so according to our Law an ascetic, who lives alone and single, commits no sin if he uses cold water, eats seeds, accepts things prepared for him, and has intercourse with women.' (7)</p>  
<p align="center">&Acirc;rdraka.</p>  
<p>"Know this: those who use cold water, eat seeds, accept things especially prepared for them, and have intercourse with women, are (no better than) householders, but they are no <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>as. (8)</p>  
<p>"If those who eat seeds, use (cold) water, and have intercourse with women, are admitted to be <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>as, then householders too are <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>as; for they do the same things&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1208"></A><A HREF="#fn_1198"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. (9)</p>  
<p>"Monks who eat seeds and use cold water, who beg alms as a means of living, will, though they leave their relations, be born again and again, and will not put an end to mundane existence." (10)</p>  
<p align="center">G&ocirc;<I>s</I>&acirc;la.</p>  
<p>'In making this statement you blame all philosophers alike! '</p>  
<p align="center">&Acirc;rdraka.</p>  
<p>"Every philosopher praises his own doctrines and makes them known. (11)</p>  
<p>"<I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>as and Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as blame one another when they teach (their doctrines). (The truth, they</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_412"><font size="1" color="green">p. 412</font></A></p>  
<p>say,) is all on their side; there is none on that of the opponents. But we blame only the (wrong) doctrines and not at all (those who entertain them). (12)</p>  
<p>"We do not detract from anybody because of his personal qualities; but we make known the path pointed out in our creed. I have been taught the supreme, right path by worthy, good men. (13)</p>  
<p>"If a well-controlled man, afraid of injuring any movable or immovable living beings, above, below, or on earth, condemns (evil deeds), he does not at all blame (anybody) in this world." (14)</p>  
<p align="center">G&ocirc;<I>s</I>&acirc;la.</p>  
<p>'Out of fear your <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a will not stay in houses for travellers or in public garden-houses; for in such places he would meet with many clever people, with lower or nobler men, with talkative or silent ones. (15)</p>  
<p>'He will not stay there because he fears lest some monks, wise, well instructed, learned men, who are well versed in the sacred texts and their meaning, should put questions to him.' (16)</p>  
<p align="center">&Acirc;rdraka.</p>  
<p>"Doing nothing without a purpose, nor without consideration, neither on the behest of the king nor from fear of anybody, he answers questions or not (according to the circumstances); but he (answers) worthy people with a definite purpose (in his mind)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1209"></A><A HREF="#fn_1199"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.

<p>"He, the wise man, impartially teaches (the Law) whether he goes (to his pupils) or not; because unworthy men have fallen from the true faith, he does not go to places (frequented by them)." (18)</p>  
<p align="center">G&ocirc;<I>s</I>&acirc;la.</p>  
<p>'As a merchant desirous of gain (shows) his wares and attracts a crowd to do business, in a similar way (acts) the <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a <I>G</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;t<I>ri</I>putra. This is what I think and calculate about it.' (19)</p>  
<p align="center">&Acirc;rdraka.</p>  
<p>"(Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra) acquires no new (Karman), he annihilates the old, avoiding wrong opinions; and thus the saviour said to others: Herein is contained the vow (leading to) Brahman (i.e. M&ocirc;ksha); this is the gain which a <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a is desirous of. Thus I say. (20)</p>  
<p>"A merchant kills living beings and desires property; not leaving his kinsmen, he attracts a crowd in order to do business. (21)</p>  
<p>"Desiring riches and addicted to sensuality, merchants wander about to earn their living. But we (say) that they are passionately fond of pleasures, unworthy, and desiring the enjoyment of love. (22)</p>  
<p>"They do not abstain from slaughter and the acquirement of property, they are in bondage and full of wickedness; and their gain of which you spoke,. will be the endless Circle of Births and pains manifold&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1210"></A><A HREF="#fn_1200"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. (23)</p>  
<p>"They do not always make profit, nor does it last</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_414"><font size="1" color="green">p. 414</font></A></p>  
<p>for ever; they meet with both results (success and failure) in their quest of gain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1211"></A><A HREF="#fn_1201"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The profit (of the teacher), however, has a beginning, but no end; the saviour and sage shares his profit (with others). (24)</p>  
<p>"Him who kills no (living beings), who has compassion on all creatures, who is well grounded in the Law, and causes the truth of the Law to be known, him you would equal to those wicked men! This is the outcome of your folly." (25)</p>

<p>'If anybody thrusts a spit through a man or a baby, mistaking him for a fragment of the granary, puts him on the fire, and roasts him, that will be a meal fit for Buddhas to break fast upon. (28)</p>

<p align="center">&Acirc;rdraka.</p>  
<p>"Well-controlled men cannot accept (your denial of) guilt incurred by (unintentionally) doing harm to living beings. It will cause error and no good to both who teach such doctrines and who believe them. (30)</p>  
<p>"A man who knows the nature of movable and immovable living beings, above, below, and on earth, who is afraid of injuring them and abstains from wicked deeds, may speak and act (in accordance with our Law); he will not be guilty of any (sin). (31)</p>  
<p>"It is impossible to mistake (a fragment of the granary) for a man; only an unworthy man can say it. How can (the idea of a man) be produced by a fragment of the granary? Even to utter this is an untruth. (32)</p>  
<p>"Do not use such speech by means of which you do evil; for such speech is incompatible with virtues. No ordained (monk) should speak empty words&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1217"></A><A HREF="#fn_1207"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. (33)</p>

(34)</p>  
<p>"Thoroughly examining the consequences of acts of living beings, (our monks) have found out a pure way of sustaining life.

<p>"A man who always feeds two thousand worthy monks, does not control himself, and will be blamed in this world like a man with bloody hands. (36)</p>  
<p>"They kill a fattened sheep, and prepare food for the sake of a particular person; they season the meat with salt and oil, and dress it with pepper. (37)</p>  
<p>"You are irreligious, unworthy men, devoted to foolish pleasures, who say that partaking heartily of this meat you are not soiled by sin. (38)</p>  
<p>"All who partake of such food, commit sins in their ignorance; but the wise do nothing of the kind. Even to utter it is an untruth. (39)</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1193"></A><A HREF="sbe4570.htm#fr_1203">409:2</A> The commentators relate a romantic story about prince &Acirc;rdraka, which need not be repeated here. Suffice it to say that he became monk, and after many adventures held the disputation which forms the subject of our lecture. After having vanquished his opponents, he was about to join Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra, when a newly-tamed elephant broke his chain, rushed on him, but just in front of him went down on his knees and paid him reverence. King Sr&ecirc;<I>n</I>ika witnessed this scene, and wondered how the elephant could have broken his chains. &Acirc;rdraka replied that it was still more strange that a man could break the fetters which worldliness had fastened upon him. The whole story must be very old, for it is epitomised in ten g&acirc;th&acirc;s by the author of the Niryukti.--The names of the opponents not stated in the text of the verses are supplied from the commentaries.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1194"></A><A HREF="sbe4570.htm#fr_1204">409:3</A> This name is spelt either &Acirc;rdra or &Acirc;rdraka, Adda in Pr&acirc;k<I>ri</I>t.</P>

It may, however, stand for sn&ecirc;h&acirc;<I>h</I>, in which case the meaning would be: love's (reward will be) pain.</P>

During a struggle with savage men (ml&ecirc;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a) some one runs away and throws his cloak off on a granary. An enemy in pursuit of that man mistakes it for him and takes hold of it, together with the part of the granary.--This interpretation looks absurd; but it will appear not so if we remember that granaries are beehive-shaped reservoirs made of sun-baked mud or wattle and mud; compare Grierson, Bihar Peasant Life, p. 17.</P>
