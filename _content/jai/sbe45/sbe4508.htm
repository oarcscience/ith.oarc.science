<p>All men who are ignorant of the Truth are subject to pain; in the endless Sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra they suffer in many ways. (1)</p>  
<p>Therefore a wise man, who considers well the ways that lead to bondage&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_105"></A><A HREF="#fn_104"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and birth, should</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>

<p><a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="green">p. 25</font></A></p>  
<p>himself search for the truth, and be kind towards all creatures. (2)</p>  
<p>'Mother, father, daughter-in-law, brother, wife, and sons will not be able to help me, when I suffer for my own deeds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_105"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' (3)</p>  
<p>This truth should be taken to heart&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_106"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> by a man of pure faith; he should (therefore) cut off greed and love, and not hanker after his former connections. (4)</p>  
<p>Cows and horses, jewels and earrings, cattle, slaves and servants: all these (possessions) you must give up in order to obtain the power of changing your form at will. (5)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Everything that happens to somebody, affects him personally; therefore, knowing the creatures' love of their own self, do not deprive them of their life, but cease from endangering and combating them. (6)</p>  
<p>Seeing that to accept (presents) leads to hell, one should not accept even a blade of grass; only to preserve one's life&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_108"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> one should eat the food that is put in one's own alms-bowl. (7)</p>  
<p>Here some are of opinion that they will be delivered from all misery by merely attending the teacher&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_110"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, without abstaining from sins. (8)</p>

<p>Acknowledging the truth about bondage and liberation, but talking only, not acting (in accordance with these tenets), they seek comfort for themselves in mighty words. (9)</p>  
<p>Clever talking will not work salvation; how should philosophical instruction do it? Fools, though sinking lower and lower through their sins, believe themselves to be wise men. (to)</p>  
<p>They are (going) a long way in the endless Sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra; therefore looking out carefully one should wander about carefully&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. (11)</p>  
<p>Choosing what is beyond and above (this world, viz. liberation), one should never desire (worldly objects), but sustain one's body only to be able to annihilate one's Karman. (12)</p>  
<p>Those will reap pains who, in thoughts, words, or acts, are attached to their body, to colours, and to forms. (13)</p>  
<p>Recognising the cause of Karman, one should wander about waiting for one's death; (knowing) the permitted quantity of food and drink, one should eat (such food as has been) prepared (by the householders for their own consumption). (14)</p>  
<p>An ascetic should not lay by any store, not even so little as the grease (sticking to his alms-bowl); but as a bird with its plumage&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, so he with his alms-bowl should wander about without desires. (15)</p>  
<p>

<p>Receiving alms in a manner to avoid faults&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_112"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and controlling one's self, one should wander about in a village (&amp;c.) without a fixed residence; careful among the careless one should beg one's food. (16)</p>  
<p>Thus has spoken the Arhat <I>G</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;t<I>ri</I>putra, the venerable native of Vai<I>s</I>&acirc;l&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, who possesses the highest knowledge and who possesses the highest faith, who possesses (at the same time) the highest knowledge and the highest faith. (17)</p>  
<p>Thus I say.</p>
