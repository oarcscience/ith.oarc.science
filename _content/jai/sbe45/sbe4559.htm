<p>What is the Path that has been preached by the wise Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_919"></A><A HREF="#fn_912"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (i.e. Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra), having correctly entered upon which path a man crosses the flood (of Sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra) which is difficult to pass? (1)</p>  
<p>O monk and great sage, tell us this best path which leads to liberation from all misery, as you know it! (2)</p>  
<p>Tell us how we should describe that path, if somebody, a god or a man, should ask us about it! (3)</p>  
<p>If somebody, a god or a man, ask you about it, tell them the truth about the path. Listen to me! (4)</p>  
<p>The very difficult (path) explained by the K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa, following which some men from this earth</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_311"><font size="1" color="green">p. 311</font></A></p>  
<p>have formerly passed over. (the Sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra) like traders over the ocean&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_920"></A><A HREF="#fn_913"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, pass over it (even now), and will pass over it in future; (this path which) I have learned, I shall explain in due order; men, listen to me! (5, 6)</p>  
<p>Earth-lives are individual beings, so are water-lives, fire-lives, and wind-lives; grass, trees, corn; (7)</p>  
<p>And the remaining, (viz.) the movable beings; thus are enumerated the six classes of living beings; these are all the living beings, there are no more besides. (8)</p>  
<p>A wise man should study them with all means of philosophical research. All beings hate pains; therefore one should not kill them. (9)</p>  
<p>This is the quintessence of wisdom: not to kill anything. Know this to be the legitimate conclusion from the principle of the reciprocity with regard to non-killing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_921"></A><A HREF="#fn_914"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. (10)</p>  
<p>He should cease to injure living beings whether they move or not, on high, below, and on earth. For this has been called the Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a, which consists in peace&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_922"></A><A HREF="#fn_915"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. (11)</p>  
<p>Master (of his senses) and avoiding wrong, he should do no harm to anybody, neither by thoughts, nor words, nor acts. (12)</p>  
<p>A wise man who restrains his senses and possesses great knowledge, should accept such things as are freely given him, being always circumspect with regard to the accepting of alms, and abstaining from what he is forbidden to accept. (13)</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_312"><font size="1" color="green">p. 312</font></A></p>  
<p>A true monk should not accept such food and drink as has been especially prepared for him along with slaughter of living beings. (14)</p>  
<p>He should not partake of a meal which contains but a particle of forbidden food&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_923"></A><A HREF="#fn_916"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: this is the Law of him who is rich in control. Whatever (food a monk) suspects (to be impure), he may not eat. (15)</p>  
<p>A man who guards his soul and subdues his senses, should never assent to anybody killing beings.--In towns and villages cases (will occur, which place) the faithful (in a dilemma)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_924"></A><A HREF="#fn_917"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. (16)</p>  
<p>Hearing the talk of people, one should not say, 'this is a good action,' nor 'this is a bad action.' For there is an objection (to either answer). (17)</p>  
<p>He should not say that it is meritorious, because he ought to save those beings, whether they move or not, which are killed there for the sake of making a gift. (18)</p>  
<p>Nor should he say that it is not meritorious, because he would then prevent those for whose sake the food and drink in question is prepared, to get their due. (19)</p>  
<p>Those who praise the gift, are accessory&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_925"></A><A HREF="#fn_918"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> to the killing of beings; those who forbid it, deprive (others) of the means of subsistence. (20)</p>  
<p>Those, however, who give neither answer, viz.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_313"><font size="1" color="green">p. 313</font></A></p>  
<p>that it is meritorious, or is not so, do not expose themselves to guilt, and will reach Beatitude&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_926"></A><A HREF="#fn_919"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. (21)</p>  
<p>Knowing that Beatitude is the best thing as the moon is among the stars, a sage always restrained and subduing his senses brings about Beatitude. (22)</p>  
<p>A pious man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_927"></A><A HREF="#fn_920"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> shows an island to the beings which are carried away (by the flood of the Sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra) and suffer for their deeds. This place of safety has been proclaimed (by the T&icirc;rthakaras). (23)</p>  
<p>He who guards his soul, subdues his senses, puts a stop to the current (of the Sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra), and is free from &Acirc;sravas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_928"></A><A HREF="#fn_921"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, is (entitled to) expound the pure, complete, unparalleled Law. (24)</p>  
<p>Those who do not know this (Law), are not awakened, though they fancy themselves awakened; believing themselves awakened, they are beyond the boundary of right faith&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_929"></A><A HREF="#fn_922"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. (25)</p>  
<p>Eating seeds and drinking cold water&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_930"></A><A HREF="#fn_923"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and what</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_314"><font size="1" color="green">p. 314</font></A></p>  
<p>has been especially prepared for them, they enter upon meditation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_931"></A><A HREF="#fn_924"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, but are ignorant of the truth, and do not possess carefulness. (26)</p>  
<p>As <I>dh</I>a&#7749;kas, herons, ospreys, cormorants, and pheasants meditate upon capturing fish, (which is) a sinful and very low meditation, so some heretical, unworthy <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>as contemplate the pursuit of pleasures; (they are) sinful and very low like herons. (27, 28)</p>  
<p>Here some weak-minded persons, abusing the pure path, enter upon a wrong path. They thereby will go to misery and destruction. (29)</p>  
<p>As a blind-born man getting into a leaky boat wants to reach the shore, but is drowned during the passage&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_932"></A><A HREF="#fn_925"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; so some unworthy, heretical <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>as, having got into the full current (of the <I>S</I>a<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra), will incur great danger. (30, 31)</p>  
<p>But knowing this Law which has been proclaimed by the K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa, (a monk) crosses the dreadful current (of the Sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra), and wanders about intent on the benefit of his soul. (32)</p>  
<p>Indifferent to worldly objects, a man should wander about treating all creatures in the world so as he himself would be treated. (33)</p>  
<p>A wise man knowing (and renouncing) excessive pride and deceit, (in short) giving up all (causes of worldly existence), brings about his Liberation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_933"></A><A HREF="#fn_926"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. (34)</p>  
<p>He acquires good qualities, and leaves off bad qualities; a monk, who vigorously practises austerities, avoids anger and pride. (35)</p>  
<p>The Buddhas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_934"></A><A HREF="#fn_927"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> that were, and the Buddhas that</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_315"><font size="1" color="green">p. 315</font></A></p>  
<p>will be, they (as it were) have Peace as their foundation, even as all things have the earth for their foundation. (36)</p>  
<p>And if any accidents whatever befall him who has gained that (foundation), he will not be overpowered by them as a mountain by the storm&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_935"></A><A HREF="#fn_928"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. (37)</p>  
<p>A restrained, very learned, and wise (monk) should accept such alms as are freely given him, being free from passions and waiting for his end. This is the doctrine of the K&ecirc;valin. (38)</p>  
<p>Thus I say.</p>
