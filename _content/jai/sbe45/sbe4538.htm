<p>Now learn from me with attentive minds the division of Living Beings and Things without life&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_585"></A><A HREF="#fn_582"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, which a monk must know who is to exert himself in self-control. (1)</p>

<p>The Living Beings and the Things without life make up this world (L&ocirc;ka); but the space where only Things without life are found is called the Non-world (Al&ocirc;ka). (2)</p>  
<p>The Living Beings and the Things without life will be described with reference to 1. substance, 2. place, 3. time, and 4. development. (3)</p>  
<p align="center">A. Things without life.</p>  
<p>Things without life are 1. possessing form, 2. formless; the formless things are of ten kinds, those possessing form are of four kinds. (4)</p>  
<p>(1) The ten kinds of formless things: 1. Dharma, 2. its divisions, 3. its indivisible parts; 4. Adharma, 5. its divisions, 6. its indivisible parts; 7. space,</p>  
<p><a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="green">p. 208</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> 8. its divisions, 9. its indivisible parts, and 10. time&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_586"></A><A HREF="#fn_583"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. (5, 6)</p>  
<p>Dharma and Adharma are co-extensive with the World (L&ocirc;ka); space fills the World and the Non-world (Al&ocirc;ka); time exists in what is called the place of time&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_587"></A><A HREF="#fn_584"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. (7)</p>  
<p>Dharma, Adharma, and Space are ever without beginning and end. (8)</p>  
<p>And time also, if regarded as a continuous flow&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_588"></A><A HREF="#fn_585"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, is called so (i.e. without beginning and end); but with regard to an individual thing it has a beginning and an end. (9)</p>  
<p>(2) The four kinds of things possessing form are 1. compound things, 2. their divisions, 3. their indivisible parts, and 4. atoms&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_589"></A><A HREF="#fn_586"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. (10)</p>  
<p>Compound things and atoms occur as individual things and apart (or different from others)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_590"></A><A HREF="#fn_587"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, in the whole world and in parts of the world; this is their distribution with regard to place. (11)</p>  
<p>Subtile things occur all over the world, gross things only in a part of it.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_209"><font size="1" color="green">p. 209</font></A></p>  
<p>I shall now give their fourfold division with regard to time. (12)</p>  
<p>With regard to the continuous flow (or development of a thing) it is without beginning and without end; but with regard to its existence (as an individual thing) it has both a beginning and an end&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_591"></A><A HREF="#fn_588"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. (13)</p>  
<p>The longest duration of Things without life possessing form is an immeasurable&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_592"></A><A HREF="#fn_589"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> period; the shortest one Samaya. (14)</p>  
<p>The longest interruption&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_593"></A><A HREF="#fn_590"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in the existence of Things without life possessing form is an endless time; the shortest one Samaya. (15)</p>  
<p>Their development is fivefold: with regard to 1. colour, 2. smell, 3. taste, 4. touch, and 5. figure. (16)</p>  
<p>Those which develop with regard to colour are of five kinds: 1. black, 2. blue, 3. red, 4. yellow, 5. white. (17)</p>  
<p>Those which develop with regard to smell are of two kinds: 1. sweet-smelling substances, and 2. of bad smell. (18)</p>  
<p>Those which develop with regard to taste are of five kinds: 1. bitter, 2. pungent, 3. astringent, 4. sour, and 5. sweet. (19)</p>  
<p>Those which develop with regard to touch are of eight kinds: 1. hard, 2. soft, 3. heavy, 4. light, 5. cold, 6. hot, 7. smooth, and 8. rough.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="green">p. 210</font></A></p>  
<p>In this way the substances have been declared, which develop with regard to touch. (20, 21)</p>  
<p>Those which develop with regard to figure are of five kinds: 1. globular, 2. circular, 3. triangular, 4. square, and 5. long. (22)</p>  
<p>Things of black colour are subdivided with regard to smell, taste, touch, and figure. (23)</p>  
<p>The same subdivision holds good with blue, red, yellow, and white things. (24-27&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_594"></A><A HREF="#fn_591"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>)</p>  
<p>Things of sweet smell are subdivided with regard to colour, taste, touch, and figure; things of bad smell are similarly subdivided. (28, 29)</p>  
<p>Things of bitter taste are subdivided with regard to colour, smell, touch, and figure. (30)</p>  
<p>The same subdivision holds good with pungent, astringent, sour, and sweet things. (31-34)</p>  
<p>Things of hard touch are subdivided with regard to colour, smell, taste, and figure. (35)</p>  
<p>The same subdivision holds good with soft, heavy, light, cold, hot, smooth, and rough things. (36-42)</p>  
<p>Things of globular figure are subdivided with regard to colour, smell, taste, and touch. (43)</p>  
<p>The same subdivision holds good with circular, triangular, square, and long things. (44-47)</p>  
<p>Thus the division of Things without life has briefly been told.</p>  
<p align="center">B. Living Beings.</p>  
<p>I shall now, in due order, deliver the division of living beings. (48)</p>  
<p>Living beings are of two kinds: 1. those still</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="green">p. 211</font></A></p>  
<p>belonging to the Sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra, and 2. the perfected souls (siddhas). The latter are of many kinds; hear me explain them. (49)</p>  
<p>(1) The perfected souls are those of women, men, hermaphrodites, of orthodox, heterodox, and householders. (50)</p>  
<p>Perfection is reached by people of the greatest, smallest, and middle size&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_595"></A><A HREF="#fn_592"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, on high places, underground, on the surface of the earth, in the ocean, and in water (of rivers, &amp;c.). (51)</p>  
<p>Ten hermaphrodites reach, at the same time, perfection, twenty women, one hundred and eight men; four householders, ten heterodox, and one hundred and eight orthodox monks. (52, 53)</p>  
<p>Two individuals of the greatest size reach perfection (simultaneously), four of the smallest size, and one hundred and eight of the middle size. (54)</p>  
<p>Four individuals reach perfection (simultaneously) on high places, two in the ocean, three in water, twenty underground, and one hundred and eight on the surface of the earth. (55)</p>  
<p>From where are the perfected souls debarred? Where do the perfected souls reside? Where do they leave their bodies, and where do they go, on reaching perfection? (56)</p>  
<p>Perfected souls are debarred from the non-world (Al&ocirc;ka); they reside on the top of the world; they leave their bodies here (below), and go there, on reaching perfection. (57)</p>  
<p>Twelve Y&ocirc;<I>g</I>anas above the (Vim&acirc;na) Sarv&acirc;rtha is</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_212"><font size="1" color="green">p. 212</font></A></p>  
<p>the place called &Icirc;shatpr&acirc;gbh&acirc;ra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_596"></A><A HREF="#fn_593"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, which has the form of an umbrella; (there the perfected souls go). (58)</p>  
<p>It is forty-five hundred thousand Y&ocirc;<I>g</I>anas long, and as many broad, and it is somewhat more than three times as many in circumference. (59)</p>  
<p>Its thickness is eight Y&ocirc;<I>g</I>anas, it is greatest in the middle, and decreases&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_597"></A><A HREF="#fn_594"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> toward the margin, till it is thinner than the wing of a fly. (60)</p>  
<p>This place, by nature pure, consisting of white gold, resembles in form an open umbrella, as has been said by the best of <I>G</I>inas. (61)</p>  
<p>(Above it) is a pure blessed place (called <I>S</I>&icirc;t&acirc;), which is white like a conch-shell, the a&#7749;ka-stone&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_598"></A><A HREF="#fn_595"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and Kunda-flowers; a Y&ocirc;<I>g</I>ana thence is the end of the world. (62)</p>  
<p>The perfected souls penetrate the sixth part&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_599"></A><A HREF="#fn_596"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of the uppermost Kr&ocirc;<I>s</I>a of the (above-mentioned) Y&ocirc;<I>g</I>ana. (63)</p>  
<p>There at the top of the world reside the blessed perfected souls, rid of all transmigration, and arrived at the excellent state of perfection. (64)</p>  
<p>The dimension of a perfected soul is two-thirds of the height which the individual had in his last existence. (65)</p>  
<p>The perfected souls, considered singly, (as individuals) have a beginning but no end; considered</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="green">p. 213</font></A></p>  
<p>collectively&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_600"></A><A HREF="#fn_597"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (as a class) they have neither a beginning nor an end. (66)</p>  
<p>They have no (visible) form, they consist of Life throughout, they are developed into knowledge and, faith, and they possess paramount happiness which admits of no comparison. (67)</p>  
<p>They all dwell in one part of the world, and have developed into knowledge and faith, they have crossed the boundary of the Sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra, and reached the excellent state of perfection. (68)</p>  
<p>(2) Living beings which still belong to the Sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra, are of two kinds: a. movable, and b. immovable ones: the immovable ones are of three kinds: (69)</p>  
<p>&#0945;. Earth Lives, &#0946;. Water Lives, and &#0947;. plants; these are the three kinds of immovable living beings; now learn from me their subdivision. (70)</p>  
<p>&#0945;. The Earth Lives are of two kinds: subtile and gross; and both of them are either fully developed or undeveloped. (71)</p>  
<p>The gross and fully developed are of two kinds: viz. smooth or rough. The smooth ones are of seven kinds: (72)</p>  
<p>Black, blue, red, yellow, white, pale dust, and clay.</p>  
<p>The rough ones are of thirty-six kinds: (73)</p>  
<p>Earth, gravel, sand, stones, rocks, rock-salt&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_601"></A><A HREF="#fn_598"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, iron, copper, tin, lead, silver, gold, and diamond; (74)</p>  
<p>Orpiment, vermilion, realgar, S&acirc;saka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_602"></A><A HREF="#fn_599"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, antimony,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_214"><font size="1" color="green">p. 214</font></A></p>  
<p>coral, Abhrapa<I>t</I>ala, Abhrav&acirc;luka; these are varieties of gross (Earth-) bodies and kinds of precious stones. (75)</p>  
<p>Hyacinth, natron, A&#7749;ka, crystal, L&ocirc;hit&acirc;ksha, emerald, Mas&acirc;ragalla, Bhu<I>g</I>am&ocirc;<I>k</I>aka, and sapphire; (76)</p>  
<p><I>K</I>andana, red chalk, Ha<I>m</I>sagarbha, Pulaka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_603"></A><A HREF="#fn_600"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and sulphur; <I>K</I>andraprabha, lapis lazuli, <I>G</I>alak&acirc;nta, and S&ucirc;ryak&acirc;nta&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_604"></A><A HREF="#fn_601"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. (77)</p>  
<p>These thirty-six kinds of 'rough earth' have been enumerated. The 'subtile earth' is but of one kind, as there is no variety. (78)</p>  
<p>The subtile species is distributed all over the world, but the gross one (is found) in a part of the world only.</p>  
<p>I shall now give their fourfold division with regard to time. (79)</p>  
<p>With regard to the continuous flow (or development of an earth-body) it is without a beginning and end; but with regard to its existence in its present form it has both a beginning and end. (80)</p>  
<p>Twenty-two thousand years is the longest duration of the Earth Lives; its shortest is less than a muh&ucirc;rta. (81)</p>  
<p>The longest duration of the body of Earth Lives, if they do not leave that (kind of) body&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_605"></A><A HREF="#fn_602"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, is an</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="green">p. 215</font></A></p>  
<p>immeasurable time; the shortest is less than one muh&ucirc;rta. (82)</p>  
<p>The longest interval between an Earth Life's leaving its body (till its return to it), is an endless time; the shortest less than one Muh&ucirc;rta. (83)</p>  
<p>Their varieties, caused by (difference of) colour, smell, taste, touch, figure, and place, are (counted) by thousands. (84)</p>  
<p>&#0946;. The Water Lives are of two kinds: subtile and gross ones; and both of them are either fully developed or undeveloped. (85)</p>  
<p>The gross and fully developed ones are of five kinds: pure water, dew, exudations, fog, and ice. (86)</p>  
<p>The 'subtile water' is of one kind, as there is no variety. The subtile species is distributed all over the world, but the gross one (is found) in a part of the world only. (87)</p>  
<p>With regard to the continuous flow, &amp;c. (as in verse 80).</p>  
<p>Seven thousand years is the longest duration of the life of Water Lives, &amp;c. (as in verse 81). (All that has been said of Earth Lives in verses 82-84 is verbally repeated here of 'Water Lives.') (88-92)</p>  
<p>&#0947;. Plants are of two kinds: subtile and gross ones; and both of them are either fully developed or undeveloped. (93)</p>  
<p>The gross and fully developed plants are of two kinds: either many have one body in common, or each has its own body. (94)</p>  
<p>Those who severally have their own body are of</p>  
<p><a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="green">p. 216</font></A></p>  
<p>many kinds: trees, shrubby plants&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_606"></A><A HREF="#fn_603"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, shrubs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_607"></A><A HREF="#fn_604"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, big plants&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_608"></A><A HREF="#fn_605"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, creeping plants&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_609"></A><A HREF="#fn_606"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, grass&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_610"></A><A HREF="#fn_607"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>; (95)</p>  
<p>Palms&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_611"></A><A HREF="#fn_608"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, plants of knotty stems or stalks&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_612"></A><A HREF="#fn_609"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>, mushrooms&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_613"></A><A HREF="#fn_610"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>, water-plants, annual plants&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_614"></A><A HREF="#fn_611"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>, and herbs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_615"></A><A HREF="#fn_612"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A>. These are called plants possessing severally their own body. (96)</p>  
<p>Those plants of which many have one body in common are of many kinds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_616"></A><A HREF="#fn_613"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A>: &Acirc;luya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_617"></A><A HREF="#fn_614"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A>, M&ucirc;laya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_618"></A><A HREF="#fn_615"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A>, ginger; (97)</p>

<p>The subtile plants are of one kind, as there is no variety. Subtile plants are distributed all over the world, gross plants (are found) in a . part of the world only. (101)</p>  
<p>With regard to the continuous flow, &amp;c. (as in verse 80). (102)</p>  
<p>Ten thousand years is the longest duration of the life of plants, &amp;c. (All as in verses 81-84. Substitute plants, which are here called vanaspati and panaka, for Earth-bodies.) (103-106)</p>  
<p>Thus the three kinds of immovable living beings have briefly been told. I shall now explain in due order the three kinds of movable living beings. (107)</p>  
<p><i>b</i>. The movable beings are &#0945;. the Fire Lives, &#0945;. the Wind Lives, and &#0947;. those with an organic body; these are the three kinds of movable beings. Learn from me their subdivision. (108)</p>  
<p>&#0945;. The Fire Lives are of two kinds: subtile and gross ones; and both of them are either fully developed or undeveloped. (109)</p>  
<p>The gross and fully developed ones are of many kinds: coal, burning chaff, fire, and flame of fire; (110)</p>  
<p>Meteors, and lightning, and many other kinds besides.</p>

<p>The subtile Fire Lives are but of one kind, as there is no variety. (111)</p>  
<p>The subtile species, &amp;c. (see verses 79-84. Substitute Fire Lives for Earth Lives. In verses 114 f., corresponding to verses 81, 89, and 103, read: 'the longest duration of the life of Fire Lives is three days,' &amp;c.; the rest as above). (112-117)</p>  
<p>&#0946;. The Wind Lives are of two kinds, &amp;c. (as in verse 109). (118)</p>  
<p>The gross and fully developed ones are of five kinds: squalls&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_625"></A><A HREF="#fn_622"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, whirlwinds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_626"></A><A HREF="#fn_623"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, thick winds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_627"></A><A HREF="#fn_624"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, high winds, low winds; (119)</p>

<p>The subtile Wind Lives are but of one kind, as there is no variety. (120)</p>  
<p>The subtile species, &amp;c. (as above 79-84. Substitute Wind Lives for Earth Lives. In verse 123, corresponding to 114, read: 'the longest duration of the life of Wind Lives is three thousand years;' the rest as above). (121-126)</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_635"></A><A HREF="sbe4538.htm#fr_638">221:1</A> Kukku<I>t</I>a is given in the dictionaries as the name of a small lizard.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_636"></A><A HREF="sbe4538.htm#fr_639">221:2</A> Nandy&acirc;varta occurs elsewhere as the name of a particular fish, and of a shell. It can be neither of these in our passage, as both animals belong to other classes than the <I>K</I>aturindriyas.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_637"></A><A HREF="sbe4538.htm#fr_640">221:3</A> Etymologically: with many-coloured wings. Probably butterflies are intended.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_638"></A><A HREF="sbe4538.htm#fr_641">221:4</A> Tirikkha = tiryak. Apparently only the higher animals are intended by this term, the lower animals, from the insects downwards, being enumerated in the preceding classes of beings.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_639"></A><A HREF="sbe4538.htm#fr_642">222:1</A> It will be seen that the longest duration of life in each hell is always equal to the shortest in the preceding one.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_642"></A><A HREF="sbe4538.htm#fr_645">223:3</A> This is, according to the Ava<I>k</I>&ucirc;ri, the meaning of puhutta<I>m</I> p<I>ri</I>thaktvam.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_646"></A><A HREF="sbe4538.htm#fr_649">224:4</A> The comm. do not explain this expression; the meaning, therefore, is doubtful. I give a literal translation of it in this and the next. verse.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_649"></A><A HREF="sbe4538.htm#fr_652">225:2</A> These are seven groups of islands situated off the eastern and western ends of the Him&acirc;laya, which are inhabited by fabulous races.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_654"></A><A HREF="sbe4538.htm#fr_657">226:2</A> I am not sure that these are the correct Sanskrit forms of the two last Kalpas; the original has &Acirc;<I>n</I>aya and P&acirc;<I>n</I>aya.</P>

(A and D) insert after verses 245 the following two verses: The longest interval between a Graiv&ecirc;yika's leaving his rank in &Acirc;nata, &amp;c., and being again born to it, is an endless time, the shortest is from two to nine years. In the case of Anuttara gods the longest interval is a S&acirc;gar&ocirc;pam&acirc; plus one Sa<I>m</I>khy&ecirc;ya, the shortest is from two to nine years.</P>

The meaning is that at the end of his fasts a monk should eat &acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;mla, nirvik<I>ri</I>tika, &amp;c. In the Ava<I>k</I>&ucirc;ri a verse from the Ni<I>s</I>&icirc;tha<I>k</I>&ucirc;rni is quoted, which gives the same rule for the second four years.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_665"></A><A HREF="sbe4538.htm#fr_669">230:4</A> The definition of these technical terms is given below, verses 262 ff.</P>

The same explanation is given by the scholiast on the Nand&icirc; (Weber, Sacred Literature of the Jains, p.124).
