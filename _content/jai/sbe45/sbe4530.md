### TWENTY-EIGHTH LECTURE.

###### THE ROAD TO FINAL DELIVERANCE.

Learn the true road leading to final deliverance, which the *G*inas have
taught; it depends on four causes and is characterised by right
knowledge and faith. (1)

I. Right knowledge; II. Faith; III. Conduct; and IV. Austerities; this
is the road taught by the *G*inas who possess the best knowledge. (2)

Right knowledge, faith, conduct, and austerities; beings who follow this
road, will obtain beatitude. (3)

I. Knowledge is fivefold: 1. *S*ruta, knowledge derived from the sacred
books; 2. Âbhinibôdhika, perception <span
id="fr_396"></span>[1](#fn_395); 3. Avadhi, supernatural knowledge; 4.
Mana*h*paryâya <span id="fr_397"></span>[2](#fn_396), knowledge of the
thoughts of other people; 5. Kêvala, the highest, unlimited knowledge.
(4)

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

This is the fivefold knowledge. The wise ones have taught the knowledge
of substances, qualities, and all developments <span
id="fr_398"></span>[1](#fn_397). (5)

Substance is the substrate of qualities; the qualities are inherent in
one substance; but the characteristic of developments is that they
inhere in either (viz. substances or qualities). (6)

Dharma, Adharma, space, time, matter, and souls (are the six kinds of
substances <span id="fr_399"></span>[2](#fn_398)); they make up this
world, as has been taught by the *G*inas who possess the best knowledge.
(7)

Dharma, Adharma, and space are each one substance only; but time,
matter, and souls are an infinite number of substances. (8)

The characteristic of Dharma is motion, that of Adharma immobility, and
that of space <span id="fr_400"></span>[3](#fn_399), which contains all
other substances, is to make room (for everything) <span
id="fr_401"></span>[4](#fn_400). (9)

The characteristic of time is duration <span
id="fr_402"></span>[5](#fn_401), that of soul the realisation <span
id="fr_403"></span>[6](#fn_402) of knowledge, faith, happiness, and
misery. (10)

The characteristic of Soul is knowledge, faith, conduct, austerities,
energy, and realisation (of its developments). (11)

The characteristic of matter is sound, darkness,

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

lustre (of jewels, &c.), light, shade, sunshine; colour, taste, smell,
and touch. (12)

The characteristic of development is singleness, separateness <span
id="fr_404"></span>[1](#fn_403), number, form, conjunction, and
disjunction. (13)

1\. *g*îva, Soul; 2. a*g*îva, the inanimate things; 3. bandha, the
binding of the soul by Karman; 4. pu*n*ya, merit; 5. pâpa, demerit; 6.
âsrava, that which causes the soul to be affected by sins; 7. sa*m*vara,
the prevention of âsrava by watchfulness; 8. the annihilation of Karman;
9. final deliverance: these are the nine truths (or categories). (14)

He who verily believes the true teaching of the (above nine) fundamental
truths, possesses righteousness. (15)

II\. Faith is produced by 1. nisarga, nature; 2. upadê*s*a, instruction;
3. â*gñ*â, command; 4. sûtra, study of the sûtras; 5. bî*g*a,
suggestion; 6. abhigama, comprehension of the meaning of the sacred
lore; 7. vistâra, complete course of study; 8. kriyâ, religious
exercise; 9. sa*m*kshêpa, brief exposition; 10. dharma, the Law. (16)

1\. He who truly comprehends, by a spontaneous effort of his mind <span
id="fr_405"></span>[2](#fn_404), (the nature of) soul, inanimate things,
merit, and demerit, and who puts an end to sinful influences <span
id="fr_406"></span>[3](#fn_405), (believes by) nature. (17)

He who spontaneously believes the four truths (explicitly mentioned in
the last verse), which the

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *G*inas have
taught, (thinking) they are of this and not of a different nature,
believes by nature. (18)

2\. But he who believes these truths, having learned them from somebody
else, either a *Kh*admastha <span id="fr_407"></span>[1](#fn_406) or a
*G*ina, believes by instruction. (19)

3\. He who has got rid of love, hate, delusion, and ignorance, and
believes because he is told to do so, believes by command. (20)

4\. He who obtains righteousness by (the study of) the Sûtras, either
Aṅgas or other works <span id="fr_408"></span>[2](#fn_407), believes by
the study of Sûtras. (21)

5\. He who by correctly comprehending one truth arrives at the
comprehension of more -- just as a drop of oil expands on the surface of
water--believes by suggestion. (22)

6\. He who truly knows the sacred lore, viz. the eleven Aṅgas, the
Prakîr*n*as <span id="fr_409"></span>[3](#fn_408), and the
D*ri*sh*t*ivâda, believes by the comprehension of the sacred lore. (23)

7\. He who understands the true nature of all substances by means of all
proofs (pramâ*n*a) and nayas <span id="fr_410"></span>[4](#fn_409),
believes by a complete course of study. (24)

8\. He who sincerely performs (all duties implied)

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

by right knowledge, faith, and conduct, by asceticism and discipline,
and by all Samitis and Guptis, believes by religious exercise. (25)

9\. He who though not versed in the sacred doctrines <span
id="fr_411"></span>[1](#fn_410) nor acquainted with other systems <span
id="fr_412"></span>[2](#fn_411), holds no wrong doctrines, believes by
brief exposition. (26)

10\. He who believes in the truth <span id="fr_413"></span>[3](#fn_412)
of the realities <span id="fr_414"></span>[4](#fn_413), the Sûtras, and
conduct, as it has been explained by the *G*inas, believes by the Law.
(27)

Right belief depends on the acquaintance with truth <span
id="fr_415"></span>[5](#fn_414), on the devotion to those who know the
truth, and on the avoiding of schismatical and heretical tenets. (28)

There is no (right) conduct without right belief <span
id="fr_416"></span>[6](#fn_415), and it must be cultivated (for
obtaining) right faith; righteousness and conduct originate together, or
righteousness precedes (conduct). (29)

Without (right) faith there is no (right) knowledge, without (right)
knowledge there is no virtuous conduct <span
id="fr_417"></span>[7](#fn_416), without virtues there is no
deliverance <span id="fr_418"></span>[8](#fn_417), and without
deliverance there is no perfection. (30)

(The excellence of faith depends on the following) eight points: 1. that
one has no doubts (about the truth of the tenets); 2. that one has no
preference (for heterodox tenets); 3. that one does not doubt

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

its saving qualities <span id="fr_419"></span>[1](#fn_418); 4. that one
is not shaken in the right belief (because heretical sects are more
prosperous); 5. that one praises (the pious); 6. that one encourages
(weak brethren); 7. that one supports or loves the confessors of the
Law; 8. that one endeavours to exalt it. (31)

III\. Conduct, which produces the destruction of all Karman, is 1.
sâmâyika <span id="fr_420"></span>[2](#fn_419), the avoidance of
everything sinful; 2. *kh*êdôpasthâpana, the initiation of a novice; 3.
parihâravi*s*uddhika, purity produced by peculiar austerities <span
id="fr_421"></span>[3](#fn_420); 4. sûkshma samparâya, reduction of
desire; 5. akashâya yathâkhyâta, annihilation of sinfulness according to
the precepts of the Arhats, as well in the case of a *Kh*admastha as of
a *G*ina. (32, 33)

IV\. Austerities are twofold: external and internal; both external and
internal austerities are sixfold. (34) By knowledge one knows things, by
faith one believes in them, by conduct one gets (freedom from Karman),
and by austerities one reaches purity. (35)

Having by control and austerities destroyed their Karman, great sages,
whose purpose is to get rid of all misery, proceed to (perfection).

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_395"></span>[152:1](sbe4530.htm#fr_396) This is usually
called mati, and is placed before *s*ruta. The same enumeration recurs
in XXXIII, 4, p. 193. Umâsvâti in Môksha Sûtra I, 14, gives the
following synonyms of mati: sm*ri*ti, *k*intâ, abhinibôdha.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[152:2](sbe4530.htm#fr_397) Ma*n*anâ*n*a*m*.

<span id="fn_397"></span>[153:1](sbe4530.htm#fr_398) Dravya, gu*n*a,
paryâya (pa*gg*ava in *G*aina Prâk*ri*t). Gu*n*a, quality, is generally
not admitted by the *G*ainas as a separate category, see *S*îlâṅka's
refutation of the Vai*s*êshika doctrines at the end of his comments on
Sûtrak*ri*tâṅga I, 12 (Bombay edition, p. 482).

<span id="fn_398"></span>[153:2](sbe4530.htm#fr_399) They are frequently
called astikâyas, or realities.

<span id="fn_399"></span>[153:3](sbe4530.htm#fr_400) It is here called
nabhas instead of âkâ*s*a.

<span id="fn_402"></span>[153:6](sbe4530.htm#fr_403) Upayôga.

<span id="fn_403"></span>[154:1](sbe4530.htm#fr_404) Singleness (êkatva)
makes a thing appear as one thing, separateness (p*ri*thaktva) as
different from others.

<span id="fn_404"></span>[154:2](sbe4530.htm#fr_405) Sahasamuiya =
svaya*m*samudita. It is usually rendered sahasammati.

<span id="fn_405"></span>[154:3](sbe4530.htm#fr_406) Âsravasa*m*vara,
see above, verse 14, 6 and 7.

<span id="fn_406"></span>[155:1](sbe4530.htm#fr_407) A *kh*admastha is
one who has not yet obtained Kêvala, or the highest knowledge; he is in
the two gu*n*asthânas (the fourteen stages in the development of the
soul from the lowest to the highest) characterised as 1. upa*s*ântamôha,
and 2. kshî*n*amôha; viz. 1. that in which delusion is only temporarily
separated from the soul, and 2. that in which delusion is finally
destroyed.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[155:2](sbe4530.htm#fr_408) Bâhira; apparently
the same works are intended which are elsewhere called
anaṅgapravish*t*a.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[155:3](sbe4530.htm#fr_409) The original has
the singular.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[155:4](sbe4530.htm#fr_410) The seven nayas are
'points of view or principles with reference to which certain judgments
are arrived at or arrangements made.' Bhandarkar, Report, p. 112.

<span id="fn_410"></span>[156:1](sbe4530.htm#fr_411) Prava*k*ana.

<span id="fn_411"></span>[156:2](sbe4530.htm#fr_412) E. g. that of
Kapila, &c., Comm.

<span id="fn_412"></span>[156:3](sbe4530.htm#fr_413) Dharma.

<span id="fn_413"></span>[156:4](sbe4530.htm#fr_414) Astikâya; see note
on verse 7.

<span id="fn_414"></span>[156:5](sbe4530.htm#fr_415) I.e. true things as
soul, &c.

<span id="fn_415"></span>[156:6](sbe4530.htm#fr_416) Sa*m*yaktva
righteousness.'

<span id="fn_416"></span>[156:7](sbe4530.htm#fr_417) *K*ara*n*agu*n*a.
The commentators make this a dvandva compound, and interpret *k*ara*n*a
as vratâdi, and gu*n*a as pi*nd*avi*s*uddhi, &c.

<span id="fn_417"></span>[156:8](sbe4530.htm#fr_418) By deliverance I
have rendered môksha, and by final perfection nirvâ*n*a. Môksha denotes
freedom from Karman, a condition which in Brâhmanical philosophy is
called *g*îvanmukti.

<span id="fn_418"></span>[157:1](sbe4530.htm#fr_419) Nivvitigi*kkh*â =
nirvi*k*ikitsa. According to the commentary it may stand for
nir-vid-*g*ugupsâ 'without loathing the saints.'

<span id="fn_419"></span>[157:2](sbe4530.htm#fr_420) See Bhandarkar,
Report, p. 98, note ‡.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[157:3](sbe4530.htm#fr_421) The Dîpikâ contains
the following details. Nine monks resolve to live together for eighteen
months. They make one of their number their superior, kalpasthita, four
become parihârikas, and the remaining four serve them (anuparihârikas).
After six months the parihârikas become anuparihârikas and vice versa.
After another six months the kalpasthita does penance and all the other
monks serve him as anuparihârikas.
