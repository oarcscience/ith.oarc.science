<p>Being contemptuously treated for the sake of his birth (as a <I>K</I>&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>&acirc;la) Sambh&ucirc;ta took, in Hastin&acirc;pura,</p>

<p>the sinful resolution (to become a universal monarch in some later birth); descending from the heavenly region Padmagulma, he was born of <I>K</I>ulan&icirc; in K&acirc;mpilya as Brahmadatta; <I>K</I>itra, however, was born in the town Purimat&acirc;la in the great family of a merchant; when he had heard the Law, he entered the order. (1, 2)</p>  
<p>In the town K&acirc;mpilya, both Sambh&ucirc;ta and <I>K</I>itra (as they were called in a former birth) met again and told each other the reward they had realised for their good and bad actions. (3)</p>  
<p>The universal monarch Brahmadatta, the powerful and glorious king, respectfully addressed the following words to him (who had been) his brother (in a former birth): (4)</p>  
<p>We were brothers once, kind to each other, loving each other, wishing well to each other. (5)</p>  
<p>'We were slaves in the country of the Da<I>s</I>&acirc;r<I>n</I>as, then antelopes on mount K&acirc;la<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ara, then geese on the shore of M<I>ri</I>taga&#7749;g&acirc;, and <I>S</I>vap&acirc;kas in the land of K&acirc;<I>s</I>i. (6)</p>  
<p>'And we were gods having great power, in the regions of the gods. This is our sixth birth, in which we are separated from each other.' (7)</p>  
<p>"Karman is produced by sinful thoughts, and you have entertained them, O king; it is by the influence of this Karman that we were separated." (8)</p>  
<p><a name="page_58"><font size="1" color="green">p. 58</font></A></p>  
<p>'I had done actions derived from truth and purity, and now I enjoy their effect; is this also true in your case, <I>K</I>itra?' (9)</p>  
<p>"Every good deed will bear its fruit to men; there is no escape from the effect of one's actions. Through riches and the highest pleasures my soul has got the reward for its virtues. (10)</p>  
<p>"Know, Sambh&ucirc;ta, that you have got the reward of your virtues in the shape of great wealth and prosperity; but know, O king, that is just so with <I>K</I>itra; he also obtained prosperity and splendour. (11)</p>  
<p>"A song of deep meaning condensed in words has been repeated in the midst of a crowd of men, (having heard) which monks of piety and virtues exert themselves in this (religion): I have become a <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a." (12)</p>  
<p>'Renowned are my beautiful palaces U<I>k</I><I>k</I>a, Udaya, Madhu, Karka, and Brahman: this house, full of treasures and containing the finest products of the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>&acirc;las, O <I>K</I>itra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_171"></A><A HREF="#fn_170"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, regard it as your own! (13)</p>  
<p>'Surround yourself with women who dance, and sing, and make music; enjoy these pleasures, O monk; I deem renunciation a hard thing.' (14)</p>  
<p>As the virtuous <I>K</I>itra, for old friendship's sake, loved the king who was attached to sensual pleasures, and as he had at heart his welfare, he spoke to him the following words: (is)</p>  
<p>"All singing is but prattle, all dancing is but</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="green">p. 59</font></A></p>  
<p>mocking, all ornaments are but a burden, all pleasures produce but pains. (16)</p>  
<p>"O king, pleasures which the ignorant like, but which produce pains, do not delight pious monks who care not for pleasure, but are intent on the virtues of right conduct. (17)</p>  
<p>"Excellent king, the lowest caste of men is that of the <I>S</I>vap&acirc;kas, to which we twice belonged; as such we were loathed by all people, and we lived in the hamlets of <I>S</I>vap&acirc;kas. (18)</p>  
<p>"In that miserable birth we lived in the hamlets of <I>S</I>vap&acirc;kas, detested by all people; then we acquired the Karman (the fruit of which we now enjoy). (19)</p>  
<p>"You are now a king of great power and prosperity, enjoying the reward of your good actions; put from you the transitory pleasures, and enter the order for the sake of the highest good&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_172"></A><A HREF="#fn_171"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>! (20)</p>  
<p>"He who in this life has done no good actions and has not practised the Law, repents of it in the next world when he has become a prey to Death. (21)</p>  
<p>"As a lion takes hold of an antelope, so Death leads off a man in his last hour; neither mother, nor father, nor brother will, at that time, save a particle (of his life). (22)</p>  
<p>"Neither his kinsmen, nor his friends, nor his sons, nor his relations will share his suffering, he alone has to bear it; for the Karman follows the doer. (23)</p>  
<p>"Leaving behind bipeds and quadrupeds, his fields, his house, his wealth, his corn, and everything;</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="green">p. 60</font></A></p>  
<p>against his will, and accompanied only by his Karman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_173"></A><A HREF="#fn_172"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he enters a new existence, either a good or a bad one. (24)</p>  
<p>"When they have burned with fire on the funeral pile his forlorn, helpless corpse, his wife and sons and kinsfolk will choose another man to provide for them. (25)</p>  
<p>"Life drags on (towards death) continuously&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_174"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; old age carries off the vigour of man. King of the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>&acirc;las, mark my words: do no fearful actions." (26)</p>  
<p>'I, too, know just as well as you, O saint, what you have told me in your speech: pleasures will get a hold on men and are not easily abandoned by such as we are, sir. (27)</p>  
<p>'O <I>K</I>itra, in Hastin&acirc;pura&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_174"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> I saw the powerful king (Sanatkum&acirc;ra), and I took that sinful resolution in my desire for sensual pleasures. (28)</p>  
<p>And since I did not repent of it, this has come of it, that I still long for sensual pleasures, though I know the Law. (29)</p>  
<p>'As an elephant, sinking down in a quagmire,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="green">p. 61</font></A></p>  
<p>sees the raised ground but does not get to the shore, so do we who long for sensual pleasures, not follow the path of monks. (30)</p>  
<p>'Time elapses and quickly pass the days; the pleasures of men are not permanent; they come to a man and leave him just as a bird leaves a tree void of fruit.' (31)</p>  
<p>"If you are unable to abandon pleasure, then do noble actions, O king; following the Law, have compassion on all creatures: then you will become a god on entering a new existence. (32)</p>  
<p>"If you have no intention of abandoning pleasure, and still long for undertakings and property, my long talk has been to no purpose. I go, king, farewell." (33)</p>  
<p>And Brahmadatta, king of the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>&acirc;las, did not act on the counsel of the saint; he enjoyed the highest pleasure, and (afterwards) sank into the deepest hell. (34)</p>  
<p>But <I>K</I>itra the great sage, of excellent conduct and penance, was indifferent to pleasure; after he had practised the highest self-control, he reached the highest place of perfection. (35)</p>  
<p>Thus I say.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_169"></A><A HREF="sbe4515.htm#fr_170">56:3</A> The stories about <I>K</I>itra and Sambh&ucirc;ta and the fate they <a name="page_57"><font size="1" color="green">p. 57</font></A> underwent in many births are common to Brahmans, <I>G</I>ainas, and Buddhists. The whole subject has been exhaustively dealt with by Prof. Leumann in two learned papers in the Wiener Zeitschrift f&uuml;r die Kunde des Morgenlandes, vol. v, pp. 1 ff., 111 ff., where an analysis of the various documents which relate this legend is given, and the Pr&acirc;k<I>ri</I>t text of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Lectures together with a German translation is published. For all details, therefore, the reader is referred to Prof. Leumann's papers.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_170"></A><A HREF="sbe4515.htm#fr_171">58:1</A> The commentator constructs <I>K</I>itra with dha<I>n</I>appabh&ucirc;ya: full of manifold treasures; but Prof. Leumann is probably right in taking it as a vocative.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_172"></A><A HREF="sbe4515.htm#fr_173">60:1</A> This might be translated, as Professor Leumann suggests: possessing Karman as the germ (of his future destiny); still I prefer the meaning vouched for by the commentators, because karmab&icirc;<I>g</I>a generally means the germ, i.e. cause of Karman, see below, Thirty-second Lecture, verse 7.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_173"></A><A HREF="sbe4515.htm#fr_174">60:2</A> See Professor Leumann's remarks on this verse, l.c., p. 137 f.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_174"></A><A HREF="sbe4515.htm#fr_175">60:3</A> When Sunand&acirc;, wife of Sanatkum&acirc;ra, paid homage to Sambh&ucirc;ta, then a <I>G</I>aina monk, and touched his feet with the curls of her soft hair, he was possessed by the desire to become a universal monarch in reward for his penances. This is the nid&acirc;na of which the text speaks, and what I render in this connection by 'taking a resolution.' For the story itself, see my Ausgew&auml;hlte Erz&auml;hlungen in M&acirc;h&acirc;r&acirc;sh<I>t</I>r&icirc;, p. 5 f.</P>
