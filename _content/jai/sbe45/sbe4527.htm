<p>There was a famous Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, <I>G</I>ayagh&ocirc;sha by name, who was born in a Br&acirc;hmanical family, but who was pledged to the performing of the yamas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_350"></A><A HREF="#fn_349"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. (1)</p>  
<p>This great sage, who subdued all his senses, and who walked on the right road, came, on his wandering from village to village, to the town of Benares. (2)</p>  
<p>There outside of Benares he took up his lodgings in a pleasant park; there he took up his abode in a pure place to live and sleep in. (3)</p>  
<p>At the same time a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, versed in the V&ecirc;das, Vi<I>g</I>ayagh&ocirc;sha by name, offered a sacrifice in that town. (4)</p>  
<p>Now this houseless (monk) at the end of a fast of a month's duration, went to the sacrifice of Vi<I>g</I>ayagh&ocirc;sha to beg alms. (5)</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_137"><font size="1" color="green">p. 137</font></A></p>  
<p>The priest wanted to turn the approaching monk off: 'I shall not give you alms, mendicant, beg somewhere else. (6)</p>  
<p>'Priests who are versed in the V&ecirc;das and are chaste as behoves offerers, who are versed in the <I>G</I>y&ocirc;tish&acirc;&#7749;ga&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_351"></A><A HREF="#fn_350"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and are well grounded in the sacrificial science, who are able to save themselves. and others, such priests ought to be presented with food and all they desire.' (7, 8)</p>  
<p>When the great sage was thus refused by the priest, he was neither angry nor pleased, as he always strove for the highest good. (9)</p>  
<p>Not to obtain food, or drink, or whatever else he wanted, but to save these people he spoke the following words: (10)</p>  
<p>"You do not know what is most essential&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_352"></A><A HREF="#fn_351"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in the V&ecirc;das, nor in sacrifices, nor in the heavenly bodies&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_353"></A><A HREF="#fn_352"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, nor in duties&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_354"></A><A HREF="#fn_353"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. (11)</p>  
<p>"Nor do you know those who are able to save themselves and others; but if you do, then speak out!" (12)</p>  
<p>The priest did not make a reply to defend himself against his insinuation; but he and all there assembled joined their hands and questioned the great sage: (13)</p>  
<p>'Tell us the most essential subject in the V&ecirc;das, and tell us what is most essential in the sacrifice;</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="green">p. 138</font></A></p>  
<p>tell us the first of the heavenly bodies, and tell us the best of dharmas. (14)</p>  
<p>'Who are able to save themselves and others (viz. tell me). I ask you to solve this my doubt, O saint.' (15)</p>  
<p>"The most essential subject in the V&ecirc;das is the agnih&ocirc;tra, and that of the sacrifice is the purpose of the sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_355"></A><A HREF="#fn_354"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; the first of the heavenly bodies is the moon, and the best of dharmas is that of K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa (i.e. <I>Ri</I>shabha). (16)</p>  
<p>"The beautiful (gods) with joined hands praise and worship the highest Lord (i.e. the T&icirc;rthakara) as the planets, &amp;c., (praise) the moon. (17)</p>  
<p>"The ignorant (priests) pretend to know the sacrifice, those whose Br&acirc;hmanical excellence consists in (false) science; they shroud themselves in study and penance, being like fire covered by ashes. (18)</p>  
<p>"He who is called by people a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a and is worshipped like fire (is no true Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a). But him we call a true Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, whom the wise point out as such. (19)</p>  
<p>"He who has no worldly attachment after entering the order, who does not repent of having become a monk&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_356"></A><A HREF="#fn_355"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and who takes delight in the noble words, him we call a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. (20)</p>  
<p>"He who is exempt from love, hatred, and fear,</p>

<p>"A lean, self-subduing ascetic, who reduces his flesh and blood, who is pious and has reached Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a, him we call a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. (22)</p>  
<p>"He who thoroughly knows living beings, whether they move or not, and does not injure them in any of the three ways&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_358"></A><A HREF="#fn_357"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, him we call a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. (23)</p>  
<p>"He who does not speak untruth from anger or for fun, from greed or from fear, him we call a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. (24)</p>  
<p>"He who does not take anything that is not given him, be it sentient or not sentient, small or large, him we call a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. (25)</p>  
<p>"He who does not carnally love divine, human, or animal beings, in thoughts, words, or acts, him we call a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. (26)</p>  
<p>"He who is not defiled by pleasures as a lotus growing in the water is not wetted by it, him we call a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. (27)</p>  
<p>"He who is not greedy, who lives unknown, who has no house and no property, and who has no friendship with householders, him we call a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. (28)</p>  
<p>"He who has given up his former connections (with his parents, &amp;c.), with his kinsmen and relations, and who is not given to pleasure, him we call a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. (29)</p>

<p>"The binding of animals (to the sacrificial pole), all the V&ecirc;das, and sacrifices, being causes of sin, cannot save the sinner; for his works (or Karman) are very powerful. (30)</p>  
<p>"One does not become a <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a by the tonsure, nor a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a by the sacred syllable &ocirc;<I>m</I>, nor a Muni by living in the woods, nor a T&acirc;pasa by wearing (clothes of) Ku<I>s</I>a-grass and bark. (31)</p>  
<p>"One becomes a <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a by equanimity, a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a by chastity, a Muni by knowledge, and a T&acirc;pasa by penance. (32)</p>  
<p>"By one's actions one becomes a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, or a Kshattriya, or a Vai<I>s</I>ya, or a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra. (33)</p>  
<p>"The Enlightened One has declared these (good qualities) through which one becomes a (true) Sn&acirc;taka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_359"></A><A HREF="#fn_358"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; him who is exempt from all Karman, we call a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. (34)</p>  
<p>"The most excellent twice-born men&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_360"></A><A HREF="#fn_359"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> who possess these good qualities, are able to save themselves and others." (35)</p>  
<p>When thus his doubt had been solved, Vi<I>g</I>ayagh&ocirc;sha, the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, assented&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_361"></A><A HREF="#fn_360"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> to the great sage <I>G</I>ayagh&ocirc;sha and to his (speech). (36)</p>  
<p>Vi<I>g</I>ayagh&ocirc;sha, pleased, folded his hands and spoke</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="green">p. 141</font></A></p>  
<p>as follows: 'You have well declared to me what true Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>ahood consists in. (37)</p>  
<p>'You are a sacrificer of sacrifices, you are the most learned of those who know the V&ecirc;das, you know the <I>G</I>y&ocirc;tish&acirc;&#7749;ga, you know perfectly the Law. (38)</p>  
<p>'You are able to save yourself and others; therefore do us the honour to accept our alms, O best of monks.' (39)</p>  
<p>"I do not want any alms; but, O Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, enter the order at once, lest you should be drifted about on the dreadful ocean of the Sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra, whose eddies are dangers. (40)</p>  
<p>"There is glue (as it were) in pleasure: those who are not given to pleasure, are not soiled by it; those who love pleasures, must wander about in the Sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra; those who do not, will be liberated. (41)</p>  
<p>"If you take two clods of clay, one wet, the other dry, and fling them against the wall, the wet one will stick to it. (42)</p>  
<p>"Thus foolish men, who love pleasure, will be fastened (to Karman), but the passionless will not, even as the dry clod of clay (does not stick to the wall)." (43)</p>  
<p>When Vi<I>g</I>ayagh&ocirc;sha had learned the excellent Law from the houseless <I>G</I>ayagh&ocirc;sha, he entered the order. (44)</p>  
<p><I>G</I>ayagh&ocirc;sha and Vi<I>g</I>ayagh&ocirc;sha both annihilated their Karman by self-control and penance, and reached the highest perfection. (45)</p>  
<p>Thus I say.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_350"></A><A HREF="sbe4527.htm#fr_351">137:1</A> It is worthy of note that, according to the opinion of our author, the knowledge of astronomy, as taught in the <I>G</I>y&ocirc;tisha, was one Of the principal accomplishments of a priest.

According to the D&icirc;pik&acirc; sacrifice here means the ten virtues: truth, penance, content, patience, right conduct, simplicity, faith, constancy, not injuring anything, and Sa<I>m</I>vara.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_355"></A><A HREF="sbe4527.htm#fr_356">138:2</A> According to the commentators we should translate: He who does not embrace (his people) on meeting them, and is not sorry on leaving them.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_356"></A><A HREF="sbe4527.htm#fr_357">139:1</A> Niddhantamalap&acirc;vaga<I>m</I>. The commentator assumes a transposition of the members in this compound. Such irregular compounds are not unfrequent in our Pr&acirc;k<I>ri</I>t. If, however, p&acirc;vaga stands for p&acirc;paka, the compound would be regular, and would refer not to 'gold,' but to the person described.

Samud&acirc;ya stands, according to the commentators, for sam&acirc;d&acirc;ya, but there is no finite verb with which to construe the absolute participle, either expressed or easily supplies'. Perhaps we must read samuv&acirc;ya vaya<I>m</I> = samuv&acirc;<I>k</I>a va<I>k</I>as; for the perfect is retained in some cases. However, if this conjecture be right, the next line would be superfluous.</P>
