<p>discipline, and who has obtained the benefit of B&ocirc;dhi which is difficult to obtain, may perhaps afterwards begin to live as he likes. (1)</p>  
<p>(He will say:) I have a good bed and wherewithal to cover me; I obtain food and drink; I know everything that comes to pass, friend; why then should I study, sir? (2)</p>

<p>He who carelessly inspects things&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_206"></A><A HREF="#fn_205"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, throwing down his duster at random, not being attentive to the inspection of things, is called a bad <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a. (9)</p>  
<p>He who carelessly inspects things, his attention being absorbed by what he hears, who always slights his teachers, is called a bad <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a. (to)</p>

<p>He who eats the food of his relations, and does not like living by alms&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_208"></A><A HREF="#fn_207"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, who reposes on the seat of the householder, is called a bad <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a. (19)</p>  
<p>Such a monk, who, like the heretics&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_209"></A><A HREF="#fn_208"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, does not protect himself from sins, who though having the appearance (of a monk) is the lowest among his worthy brethren, is despised in this world like poison; he is nobody in this world and in that beyond. (20)</p>  
<p>But he who always avoids these sins, and is pious amongst his brethren, is welcomed in this world like nectar; he conquers this world and the next&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_210"></A><A HREF="#fn_209"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. (21)</p>
