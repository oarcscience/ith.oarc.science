<p>O long-lived (<I>G</I>amb&ucirc;sv&acirc;min)! I (Sudharman) have heard the following discourse from the Venerable (Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra). We now come to the Lecture called 'Knowledge of Food.' The contents of it are as follows:</p>  
<p>Here in the East, West, North, and South there are, all in all, in the world four kinds of seed: seeds generated at the top (of the plant), at its root, at its knots, at its stem&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1139"></A><A HREF="#fn_1131"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. According to the seed and place</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_389"><font size="1" color="green">p. 389</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (of growth) of these plants some beings--born in earth, originated in earth, and grown in earth, having in it their birth, origin, and growth, being impelled by their Karman, and coming forth in it on account of their Karman, growing there in particles of earth, the origin of various things--come forth as trees&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1140"></A><A HREF="#fn_1132"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. (1)</p>  
<p>These living beings feed on the liquid substance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1141"></A><A HREF="#fn_1133"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of these particles of earth, the origin of various things; these beings consume earth-bodies, water-bodies, fire-bodies, wind-bodies, bodies of plants; they deprive of life the bodies of manifold movable and immovable beings; the destroyed bodies which have been consumed before, or absorbed by the rind, (are) digested and assimilated (by them). And the bodies of these (trees) which bring forth their different parts, are of manifold colours, smells, tastes, touches, forms, and arrangement of corporeal particles&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1142"></A><A HREF="#fn_1134"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_390"><font size="1" color="green">p. 390</font></A></p>  
<p>These beings (animating trees) come into existence because of their Karman; so we are taught (by the T&icirc;rthakaras, &amp;c.) (2)</p>  
<p>And again it has been said of old: some beings born in trees, originated by trees, sprung from trees, (&amp;c., as in &sect; 1, down to) springing from trees that originated in earth, come forth as trees originated by trees&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1143"></A><A HREF="#fn_1135"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. These beings feed on the sap of the trees originated in earth, (&amp;c., all as in &sect; 2, down to the end). (3)</p>  
<p>(In the same way, and in nearly the same words, the offshoots of the trees mentioned in the preceding paragraph are treated of.) (4)</p>  
<p>And again it has been said of old: some beings born in trees, (&amp;c., all as above, down to) growing in trees, that are originated by trees, come forth as their roots, bulb, stem, branches, twigs, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1144"></A><A HREF="#fn_1136"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. These beings feed on the sap of those trees originated by trees, (&amp;c., all as in &sect; 2, down to) and the bodies of the roots, bulb, stem, &amp;c. are of manifold colours, (&amp;c., all as in &sect; 2, down to the end). (5)</p>  
<p>(The four paragraphs that come next, 6-9, are identical with the preceding ones, except that 'creeper&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1145"></A><A HREF="#fn_1137"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>' is substituted for 'tree.') (6-9)</p>  
<p>(In the same way 'grass&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1146"></A><A HREF="#fn_1138"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>' is treated in four paragraphs, but the whole is much abridged; then</p>  
<p>

<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_391"><font size="1" color="green">p. 391</font></A></p>  
<p>it is said that 'herbs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1147"></A><A HREF="#fn_1139"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>' and 'plants&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1148"></A><A HREF="#fn_1140"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>' are to be treated in four paragraphs each.) (10-15)</p>  
<p>And again it has been said of old: some beings born in earth, (&amp;c., all as in &sect; 1, down to) growing there in particles of earth that are the origin of various things, come forth as Aya, K&acirc;ya, Kuha<I>n</I>a, Kandu, Uvv&ecirc;haliya, Nivv&ecirc;haliya, &Ecirc;sava, Sa<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a, <I>Kh</I>attaga, V&acirc;s&acirc;<I>n</I>iya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1149"></A><A HREF="#fn_1141"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. (The rest as in &sect; 2, but substitute the words &Acirc;ya, &amp;c. for 'trees.') Here there is only one paragraph, the remaining three do not apply here&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1150"></A><A HREF="#fn_1142"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. (16)</p>  
<p align="center">_______________________</p>  
<p>And again it has been said of old: some beings born in water, (&amp;c., all as in &sect;&sect; 1-11, substitute only 'water' for 'earth.' Thus we have four paragraphs for trees, four for creepers, four for grass, four for herbs, four for plants). (17)</p>  
<p>Now it has been said of old: some beings born in water, (&amp;c., all as above, down to) growing in particles of water that are the origin of various things, come forth as Udaga, Avaga&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1151"></A><A HREF="#fn_1143"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, Pa<I>n</I>aga, S&ecirc;v&acirc;la&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1152"></A><A HREF="#fn_1144"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, Kalambuya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1153"></A><A HREF="#fn_1145"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>, Kas&ecirc;ruya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1154"></A><A HREF="#fn_1146"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>, Ka<I>k</I><I>kh</I>abh&acirc;<I>n</I>iya, Uppala,</p>

(The rest similar as in &sect; 2.) (18)</p>  
<p>And again it has been said of old: some beings come forth as movable beings from trees born in earth, from trees originated by trees, from the roots, (&amp;c., down to) seeds produced by trees, originated by creepers born on trees, from creepers born on creepers, from the roots, &amp;c. of creepers born on creepers, from grass&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1158"></A><A HREF="#fn_1150"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, from herbs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1159"></A><A HREF="#fn_1150"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, from plants&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1160"></A><A HREF="#fn_1150"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, from Aya, (&amp;c., all down to) K&ucirc;ra born in earth; from trees born in water (the rest similar as with trees born in earth), from Udaga, (&amp;c., all down to) Pukkhalatthibhaga born in water. (19)</p>  
<p>These creatures feed on the sap of the trees, creepers, grass, herbs, plants, be they born in earth or water, on trees or creepers or grass or herbs or plants; (the sap) of their roots, (&amp;c., all down to) seeds, of &Acirc;yas, &amp;c., of Udakas, &amp;c. And these creatures consume earth-bodies, (&amp;c., all as in &sect; 2, down to) assimilated by them. And the bodies of these beings born of trees, creepers, grass, herbs, plants, their roots, &amp;c., of &Acirc;yas, &amp;c., of Udagas, &amp;c., are of manifold colours, (&amp;c., the rest as in &sect; 2, down to the end).

<p>And again it has been said of old: a man and a woman combine in cohabitation in a cunnus, which was produced by their Karman, and there they deposit their humours. Therein are born the souls of different men, viz. of those born in Karmabh&ucirc;mi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1161"></A><A HREF="#fn_1151"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, or in Akarmabh&ucirc;mi, or in the minor continents, of &Acirc;ryas and barbarians, as women or men or eunuchs, according to the semen and blood of the mother&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1162"></A><A HREF="#fn_1152"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and the other circumstances&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1163"></A><A HREF="#fn_1153"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (contingent on their coming into existence). These beings at first feed on the menses of the mother and the semen of the father, or both combined into an unclean, foul (substance). And afterwards they absorb with a part (of their bodies) the essence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1164"></A><A HREF="#fn_1154"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of whatever food the mothers take. Gradually increasing and attaining to the proper dimensions of a foetus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1165"></A><A HREF="#fn_1155"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> they come forth from the womb, some as males, some as females, some as neuters. As long as they are babies, they suck the mother's milk; but when they grow older, they eat boiled rice, or gruel, or both movable and immovable beings. These beings consume earth-bodies, (&amp;c., all as before, down to) assimilated by them. And the bodies of these men, viz. those born in Karmabh&ucirc;mi, or Akarmabh&ucirc;mi, or in the minor continents, of &Acirc;ryas and barbarians, are of manifold</p>

<p>colours, (&amp;c., all as in &sect; 2, down to the end). (21)</p>  
<p>(This paragraph is nearly identical with the preceding one, but substitute 'aquatic animals of five organs of sense, viz. fishes, (all down to)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1166"></A><A HREF="#fn_1156"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> porpoises,' for 'different men' in the beginning and the end. The following sentence in the middle is slightly different; it runs thus: 'as long as they are young, they feed on the mothers&#8217; humours, but when they grow older they eat plants, or both movable and immovable beings.') (22)</p>  
<p>(This paragraph treats of) quadrupeds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1167"></A><A HREF="#fn_1157"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, terrestrial animals with five organs of sense, viz. solidungular animals, biungular animals, multiungular animals, and animals having toes with nails. (All as in the last paragraph, only 'as long as they are young, they feed on their mothers&#8217; milk.') (23)</p>  
<p>(This paragraph treats of) reptiles moving on the breast, (being) terrestrial animals with five organs of sense, viz. snakes, huge snakes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1168"></A><A HREF="#fn_1158"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, &Acirc;<I>s</I>&acirc;lika, and dragons&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1169"></A><A HREF="#fn_1159"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. (All as before, but the following passage is different.) Some bring forth eggs, some bring forth living young ones; some come out of the egg as males, some as females, some as neuters. As long as they are young, they live on wind. (The rest as above.) (24)</p>

(All as before; only the following passage is different): 'As long as they are young, they are hatched by their mothers&#8217; warmth.' (The rest as above.) (26)</p>  
<p>And again it has been said of old: there are beings of manifold birth and origin, (&amp;c., all as in &sect; 1, down to) growing there on the animate or inanimate bodies of manifold movable or immovable creatures, come forth as parasites&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1174"></A><A HREF="#fn_1164"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. These beings feed on the humours of various movable and immovable creatures, &amp;c. And the bodies of these movable and immovable parasites are of manifold colours, (&amp;c., as above). (27)</p>  
<p>In the same way vermin generated in filthy substances&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1175"></A><A HREF="#fn_1165"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and in the skin of living animals&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1176"></A><A HREF="#fn_1166"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> are to be treated of. (28, 29)</p>

These beings feed on the humours of these manifold movable and immovable creatures, &amp;c. And the bodies of these (water-lives, viz.) hoar-frost, &amp;c., produced by manifold movable or immovable creatures, are of manifold colours, (&amp;c., as above)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1178"></A><A HREF="#fn_1168"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. (30)</p>  
<p>And again it has been said of old: some beings, born in water, (&amp;c., all similar as in &sect; 1, down to) come forth in water(-bodies) in the water produced by manifold movable or immovable beings. These beings feed on the humours of the water(-bodies) produced by manifold movable and immovable creatures. (The rest similar as above.) (31)</p>  
<p>And again it has been said of old: some beings, born in water, (&amp;c., all similar as in &sect; 1, down to) come forth in water-bodies produced by other water-bodies. These beings feed on the humours of those other water-bodies produced by water-bodies. (The rest similar as above.) (32)</p>  
<p>And again it has been said of old: some beings, born in water, (&amp;c., all similar as in &sect; 1, down to) come forth as movable creatures in the water</p>

<p>And again it has been said of old: some beings, of various birth and origin, (&amp;c., all as in &sect; 1, down to) come forth as fire-bodies in the manifold animate or inanimate bodies of movable or immovable creatures&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1179"></A><A HREF="#fn_1169"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. These beings feed on the manifold movable or immovable creatures. The rest similar as before.)</p>  
<p>The remaining three paragraphs are similar (to those treating of) water-bodies. (34)</p>  
<p>(This paragraph treats of wind-bodies in the same way as the preceding ones treated of fire-bodies; like it, it consists of four paragraphs). (35)</p>  
<p>And again it has been said of old: some beings, of various birth and origin, (&amp;c., all as in &sect; 1, down to) come forth, in the manifold animate and inanimate bodies of movable and immovable creatures&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1180"></A><A HREF="#fn_1170"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, as earth, gravel, &amp;c. Here the following verses (from the Uttar&acirc;dhyayana XXXVI, 74-77) are to be made use of:</p>  
<p>1. Earth, gravel, sand, stones, rocks, rock-salt, iron, copper, tin, lead, silver, gold, and diamond;</p>  
<p>2. Orpiment, vermilion, realgar, S&acirc;saka, antimony, coral, Abhrapa<I>t</I>ala, Abhrav&acirc;luka; these are varieties of gross (earth-)bodies, and precious stones.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_398"><font size="1" color="green">p. 398</font></A></p>  
<p>3. Hyacinth, natron, A&#7749;ka, crystal, L&ocirc;hit&acirc;ksha, emerald, Mas&acirc;ragalla, Bhu<I>g</I>am&ocirc;<I>k</I>aka, and sapphire;</p>  
<p>4. <I>K</I>andana, red chalk, Ha<I>m</I>sagarbha, Pulaka, and sulphur; <I>K</I>andraprabha, lapis lazuli, <I>G</I>alak&acirc;nta, and S&ucirc;ryak&acirc;nta.</p>  
<p>These beings feed on the humours of these manifold movable and immovable beings. (The rest as above.)</p>  
<p>The remaining three paragraphs are similar (to those treating of) water-bodies. (36)</p>  
<p>And again it has been said of old: all sorts of living beings, of manifold birth, origin, and growth, born in bodies, originated in bodies, grown in bodies, feeding on bodies, experience their Karman, are actuated by it, have their form and duration of life determined by Karman, and undergo changes through the influence of Karman. This you should know, and knowing it you will be careful and circumspect with regard to your food, and always exert yourself. (37)</p>  
<p>Thus I say.</p>
