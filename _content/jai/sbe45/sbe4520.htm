<p>In the town of K&acirc;mpilya there was a king, named Sa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>aya, who possessed numerous troops and war-chariots; once he went a-hunting. (1)</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="green">p. 81</font></A></p>  
<p>He was surrounded on all sides by a large host of horses, elephants, chariots, and footmen. (2)</p>  
<p>He chased the deer on horseback in the K&ecirc;sara-park of K&acirc;mpilya; and intent on his sport he killed there the frightened deer. (3)</p>  
<p>Now in the K&ecirc;sara-park there was a houseless ascetic intent on sacred study and meditating on the Law. (4)</p>  
<p>Annihilating sinful inclinations&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_212"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he meditated in the Asph&ocirc;ta-bower&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_213"></A><A HREF="#fn_212"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. But the king killed the deer that fled to him. (5)</p>  
<p>Now the king on horseback came quickly there; he saw the killed deer and saw the monk there. (6)</p>  
<p>The king in his consternation (thought) 'I had nearly hurt the monk; ill-fated and cruel me that is mad for the sport.' (7)</p>  
<p>Having dismissed his horse, the king bowed respectfully to the monk's feet (saying), 'Forgive me this, Reverend sir.' (8)</p>  
<p>But the venerable monk, being plunged in silent meditation, made no reply to the king, who, therefore, was seized with fear. (9)</p>  
<p>'I am Sa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>aya; answer me, Reverend sir; a monk might by the fire of his wrath reduce millions of men to ashes.' (10)</p>  
<p>'Be without fear, O king; but grant safety to others also; in this transient world of living beings, why are you addicted to cruelty? (11)</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="green">p. 82</font></A></p>  
<p>'As you must, of necessity, one day part with everything, in this transient world of living beings, why do you cling to kingly power? (12)</p>  
<p>'Transient like a stroke of lightning are life and beauty, which you love so much; you do not comprehend what will benefit you in the next life. (13)</p>  
<p>'Wives and children, friends and relations, all are dependent on a man during his life; but they will not follow him in death. (14)</p>  
<p>'The sons, in great sorrow, will remove the corpse of their father (to the cemetery); and so will parents do with their sons and relations; O king, do penance! (15)</p>  
<p>'O king, other men, glad, and pleased, and well attired, will enjoy the riches (the deceased) had amassed, and will dally with the wives he had so well guarded. (16)</p>  
<p>'And whatever actions he has done, good or wicked ones, with their Karman he will depart to his next existence.' (17)</p>  
<p>Then the king was taught the Law by this monk, and was filled with a great desire for purity, and disregard of worldly objects. (18)</p>  
<p>Sa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>aya gave up his kingly power and adopted the faith of the <I>G</I>inas in the presence of the venerable monk Gardabh&acirc;li. (19)</p>  
<p>A Kshattriya, who had abandoned his kingdom and had turned monk, said to him: 'As you look so happy in outward appearance, you must have peace of mind. (20)</p>  
<p>'What is your name, to which G&ocirc;tra do you belong, and why have you become an ascetic&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_214"></A><A HREF="#fn_213"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>?</p>

<p>"My name is Sa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>aya; I belong to the G&ocirc;tra of G&ocirc;tama; my teacher is Gardabh&acirc;li, who is conversant with the sacred lore and good conduct. (22)</p>  
<p>"O great sage, the man of limited knowledge talks foolishly on these four heads&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_216"></A><A HREF="#fn_215"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, viz. the existence of the soul, its non-existence, idolatry, and the inefficiency of knowledge. (23)</p>  
<p>"This has been declared by him who is enlightened, wise, liberated, conversant with the sacred lore and good conduct, who is truthful and of right energy. (24)</p>  
<p>"Men who commit sins will go to hell; but those who have walked the road of righteousness, will obtain a place in heaven. (25)</p>  
<p>"All this delusive talk (of the heretics) is untrue and without any meaning; I live and walk about according to the rules of self-control. (26)</p>

<p>

<p>"I know all these heresies to be contemptible; I know that there will be a life hereafter, and I know my Self. (27)</p>  
<p>"I was an illustrious god in the Mah&acirc;pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a heaven, and reached old age as we here would say of a man who is a hundred years old; but in heaven, hundred years consist of as many Mah&acirc;p&acirc;l&icirc;s of P&acirc;l&icirc;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_217"></A><A HREF="#fn_216"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. (28)</p>  
<p>"Descending from the Brahmal&ocirc;ka, I was born as a man. I know exactly the length of my life as well as that of other men. (29)</p>  
<p>"A monk should abandon the manifold doctrines (of heretics), and his own fancies, and such deeds as are productive of evil everywhere. One should live up to this wisdom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_218"></A><A HREF="#fn_217"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. (30)</p>  
<p>"I keep clear of the (superstitious) questions and the spells of laymen, exerting myself day and night (in the true religion). Thinking thus, one should practise austerities. (31)</p>  
<p>"And what you of a pure mind asked me just now, that has been revealed by the enlightened one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_219"></A><A HREF="#fn_218"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; such knowledge makes part of the creed of the <I>G</I>inas. (32)</p>  
<p>"A wise man believes in the existence of the soul&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_220"></A><A HREF="#fn_219"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>,</p>

<p>he avoids the heresy of the non-existence of the soul; possessing true faith one should practise the very difficult Law according to the faith. (33)</p>  
<p>"Having learned this pure creed, which is adorned by truth and righteousness, Bharata&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_221"></A><A HREF="#fn_220"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> gave up Bharatavarsha and all pleasures, and entered the order. (34)</p>  
<p>"King Sagara&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_221"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> also gave up the ocean-girt Bharatavarsha and his unrivalled kingly power, and reached perfection through his compassion. (35)</p>  
<p>"After having given up Bharatavarsha, the famous universal monarch of great power, called Maghavan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_223"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, entered the order. (36)</p>  
<p>"King Sanatkum&acirc;ra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_224"></A><A HREF="#fn_223"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, a universal monarch of great power, placed his son on the throne, and then practised austerities. (37)</p>

<p>"King Kunthu, the bull of the Aikshv&acirc;ka race, the widely famed lord, reached perfection. (39)</p>  
<p>"King Ara, after he had given up the sea-girt Bharatavarsha, reached perfection on becoming exempt from defilement. (40)</p>  
<p>"After having given up his large kingdom, his army and war-chariots, his exquisite pleasures, Mah&acirc;padma&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_226"></A><A HREF="#fn_225"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> practised austerities. (41)</p>  
<p>"Having brought the (whole) earth under his sceptre, king Harish&ecirc;<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_227"></A><A HREF="#fn_226"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, who humbled the pride (of other kings), reached perfection. (42)</p>

<p>reached perfection which has been taught by the <I>G</I>inas. (43)</p>  
<p>"Da<I>s</I>&acirc;r<I>n</I>abhadra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_229"></A><A HREF="#fn_228"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, giving up his flourishing kingdom of Das&acirc;r<I>n</I>a, turned monk; he renounced the world, being directed to do so by <I>S</I>akra himself. (44)</p>  
<p>"Karaka<I>n</I><I>d</I>u was king of Kali&#7749;ga; Dvimukha, of Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>&acirc;la; Nami, of Vid&ecirc;ha; Naggati (or rather Nagna<I>g</I>it), of G&acirc;ndh&acirc;ra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_230"></A><A HREF="#fn_229"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. (45)</p>  
<p>"Nami humbled himself, being directed to do so by Sakra himself; the king of Vid&ecirc;ha left the house and became a <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a. (46)</p>  
<p>"These bulls of kings have adopted the faith of the <I>G</I>inas; after having placed their sons on the throne, they exerted themselves as <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>as. (47)</p>  
<p>"Ud&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_231"></A><A HREF="#fn_230"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, the bull of the kings of Sauv&icirc;ra, renounced the world and turned monk; he entered the order and reached perfection. (48)</p>  
<p>"And thus the king of K&acirc;<I>s</I>i&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_232"></A><A HREF="#fn_231"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, exerting himself for the best truth, abandoned all pleasures, and hewed down, as it were, his Karman like a forest. (49)</p>  
<p>"And thus king Vi<I>g</I>aya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_233"></A><A HREF="#fn_232"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, whose sins were not quite annihilated&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_234"></A><A HREF="#fn_233"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, turned monk after he, the famous man, had quitted his excellent kingdom. (50)</p>

<p>"Why should a wise man, for bad reasons, live on earth like a madman, since those persons (mentioned above) who reached eminence, exerted themselves strongly? (52)</p>  
<p>"I have spoken true words able to promote virtue; some have been saved, some are being saved, and some will be saved. (53)</p>  
<p>"Why should a wise man, for bad reasons, bring affliction upon himself? He who has become free from all ties and sins, will reach perfection." (54)</p>  
<p>Thus I say.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_210"></A><A HREF="sbe4520.htm#fr_211">80:4</A> The commentators Sanskritise this name in Sa<I>m</I>yata. But however appropriate it may be to a <I>G</I>aina, it certainly does not <a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="green">p. 81</font></A> look like a king's name. The Sanskrit form of the name was probably Sa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>aya or S<I>ri</I><I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>aya, both of which frequently occur in Sanskrit literature.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_213"></A><A HREF="sbe4520.htm#fr_214">82:1</A> Literally, a Brahman.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_214"></A><A HREF="sbe4520.htm#fr_215">83:1</A> Buddh&ecirc;, explained &acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;ry&acirc;n, preceptors.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_215"></A><A HREF="sbe4520.htm#fr_216">83:2</A> These are the four great heresies: (1) that of the kriy&acirc;v&acirc;dinas, who maintain that the soul exists; (2) that of the akriy&acirc;v&acirc;dinas, who hold the reverse of the preceding doctrine; (3) that of the vainayikas, which seems to be identical with salvation by bhakti; (4) that of the a<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;nav&acirc;dinas, who contend that knowledge is not necessary for salvation, but t a p a s; this seems identical with the karmapatha. The commentators explain kriy&acirc;v&acirc;dina<I>h</I> 'those who believe the soul or &acirc;tman to be characterised by the verb to be (i.e. by a permanent and unchangeable existence), and ascribe to it such qualities as ubiquity or non-ubiquity, activity or non-activity.' This they treat as heresy, but from Mah&acirc;vagga VI, 31, 2 (vol. xvii, p. 109) it is evident that the <I>G</I>ainas were considered kriy&acirc;v&acirc;dins. The akriy&acirc;v&acirc;da is also identified with the ksha<I>n</I>ikav&acirc;da or doctrine, usually ascribed to Buddhists, that everything has but a momentary existence and is in the next moment replaced by a facsimile of itself. About these heresies compare the S&ucirc;trak<I>ri</I>t&acirc;&#7749;ga I, 12; II, 2, 77.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_216"></A><A HREF="sbe4520.htm#fr_217">84:1</A> According to the commentary a p&acirc;l&icirc; seems to be what is commonly called paly&ocirc;pam&acirc;, and mah&acirc;p&acirc;l&icirc; a s&acirc;gar&ocirc;pam&acirc;. However the longest life of a god in Brahmal&ocirc;ka is but ten S&acirc;gar&ocirc;pam&acirc;s, see below, XXXVI, 225. The construction of the verse is very involved, but the drift of it cannot be mistaken.</P>

I believe that vi<I>g</I><I>g</I>&acirc;m here stands for vidv&acirc;n, as in the following verse. The meaning would then be, 'knowing this one should live as a monk.'</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_219"></A><A HREF="sbe4520.htm#fr_220">84:4</A> The <I>G</I>ainas do not deny the existence of the soul, but the unalterable character of the soul. Hence they object to the kriy&acirc;v&acirc;da.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_220"></A><A HREF="sbe4520.htm#fr_221">85:1</A> Bharata was the eldest son of <I>Ri</I>shabha, the first T&icirc;rthakara. He became the first <I>K</I>akravartin, or universal monarch, and resided in Ay&ocirc;dhy&acirc;. At his renunciation he was ordered by Indra himself to pluck out five handfuls of his hair as is the custom of <I>G</I>aina monks on entering the order.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_221"></A><A HREF="sbe4520.htm#fr_222">85:2</A> Sagara, king of Ay&ocirc;dhy&acirc;, was, according to the legend contained in the commentary (see R. Fick, Eine jainistische Bearbeitung der Sagara-Sage, Kiel, 1889), the younger brother of A<I>g</I>ita, the second T&icirc;rthakara. He became the second <I>K</I>akravartin, and, in the end, he was ordained by A<I>g</I>ita. The <I>G</I>aina legend seems to be but a strangely distorted version of the story of Sagara told in the first book of the R&acirc;m&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a.</P>

Kunthu sounds strange for a proper name. I think it just possible that it is a popular or Pr&acirc;k<I>ri</I>t corruption of Kakutstha, who was an Aikshv&acirc;ka. As is well known, R&acirc;ma is frequently called after him K&acirc;kutstha, and so are other kings of the same line, in which he stands as the twenty-fifth according to the list in the R&acirc;m&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a I, 70.</P>

He wrenched the sovereignty of the world from Namu<I>k</I>i, minister of his father Padm&ocirc;ttara, who had ascended the throne, by making him promise as much of his territory as he could cover with three strides. This is the Brahmanical story of Vish<I>n</I>u and Bali, for whom the <I>G</I>ainas have substituted Namu<I>k</I>i. According to them the minister Namu<I>k</I>i was, in a disputation, defeated by the <I>G</I>aina monks, and to revenge himself on them, he ordered them to quit his kingdom as soon as he got it.--Mah&acirc;padma's residence was Hastin&acirc;pura.</P>
