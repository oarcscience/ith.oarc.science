<p>The eight articles&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_327"></A><A HREF="#fn_326"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the creed are the Samitis and the Guptis; there are five Samitis and three Guptis. (1)</p>  
<p>The Samitis&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_328"></A><A HREF="#fn_327"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> are: 1. &icirc;ry&acirc;-samiti (going by paths trodden by men, beasts, carts, &amp;c., and looking carefully so as not to occasion the death of any living creature); 2. bh&acirc;sh&acirc;-samiti (gentle, salutary, sweet, righteous speech); 3. &ecirc;sha<I>n</I>&acirc;-samiti (receiving alms in a manner to avoid the forty-two faults that are laid down); 4. &acirc;d&acirc;na-samiti (receiving and keeping of the things necessary for</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="green">p. 130</font></A></p>  
<p>religious exercises, after having carefully examined them); 5. u<I>k</I><I>k</I>&acirc;ra-samiti (performing the operations of nature in an unfrequented place). The three Guptis (which are here included in the term Samiti in its wider application) are: 1. mano-gupti (preventing the mind from wandering in the forest of sensual pleasures by employing it in contemplation, study, &amp;c.); 2. v&acirc;g-gupti (preventing the tongue from saying bad things by a vow of silence, &amp;c.); 3. k&acirc;ya-gupti (putting the body in an immovable posture as in the case of K&acirc;y&ocirc;tsarga). (2)</p>  
<p>The eight Samitis are thus briefly enumerated, in which the whole creed taught by the <I>G</I>inas and set forth in the twelve A&#7749;gas, is comprehended. (3)</p>  
<p>1. The walking of a well-disciplined monk should be pure in four respects: in respect to 1. the cause&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_329"></A><A HREF="#fn_328"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; 2. the time; 3. the road; 4. the effort&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_330"></A><A HREF="#fn_329"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. (4)</p>  
<p>The cause is: knowledge, faith, and right conduct; the time is day-time; the road excludes bad ways. (5)</p>  
<p>The effort is fourfold, viz. as regards: 1. substance, 2. place, 3. time, and 4. condition of mind. Hear me explain them. (6)</p>  
<p>With regard to substance: the (walking monk) should look with his eyes; with regard to place: the space of a yuga (i.e. four hastas or cubits); with regard to time: as long as he walks; and with regard to condition of mind: carefully&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_331"></A><A HREF="#fn_330"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. (7)</p>  
<p>He walks carefully who pays attention only to</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_131"><font size="1" color="green">p. 131</font></A></p>  
<p>his walk and his body (executing it), whilst he avoids attending to the objects of sense, but (minds) his study, the latter in all five ways&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_332"></A><A HREF="#fn_331"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. (8)</p>  
<p>2. To give way to: anger, pride, deceit and greed, laughter, fear, loquacity and slander&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_333"></A><A HREF="#fn_332"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; these eight faults should a well-disciplined monk avoid; he should use blameless and concise speech at the proper time. (9, 10)</p>  
<p>3. As regards begging&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_334"></A><A HREF="#fn_333"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, a monk should avoid the faults in the search&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_335"></A><A HREF="#fn_334"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, in the receiving&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_336"></A><A HREF="#fn_335"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, and in the use&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_337"></A><A HREF="#fn_336"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> of the three kinds of objects, viz. food, articles of use, and lodging. (11)</p>  
<p>A zealous monk should avoid in the first (i.e. in the search for alms) the faults occasioned either by the giver (udgama) or by the receiver (utp&acirc;dana); in the second (i.e. in the receiving of alms) the faults inherent in the receiving; and in the use of the articles received, the four faults&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_338"></A><A HREF="#fn_337"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>. (12)</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="green">p. 132</font></A></p>  
<p>4. If a monk takes up or lays down the two kinds of things belonging to his general and </p>  
<p><a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="green">p. 133</font></A></p>  
<p>supplementary&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_339"></A><A HREF="#fn_338"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> outfit, he should proceed in the following way. (13)</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="green">p. 134</font></A></p>  
<p>A zealous monk should wipe the thing after having inspected it with his eyes, and then he should take it up or put it down, having the Samiti in both respects&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_340"></A><A HREF="#fn_339"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. (I 4)</p>  
<p>5. Excrements, urine, saliva, mucus, uncleanliness of the body, offals of food, waste things, his own body (when he is about to die), and everything of this description (is to be disposed of in the way to be described). (15)</p>  
<p>[A place may be not frequented and not seen (by people), or not frequented but seen, or frequented and not seen, or frequented and seen. (16)]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_341"></A><A HREF="#fn_340"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>In a place neither frequented nor seen by other people, which offers no obstacles to self-control, which is even, not covered with grass or leaves&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_342"></A><A HREF="#fn_341"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and has</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="green">p. 135</font></A></p>  
<p>been brought into its present condition&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_343"></A><A HREF="#fn_342"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> not long ago, which is spacious, has an inanimate surface-layer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_344"></A><A HREF="#fn_343"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, not too near (the village, &amp;c.), not perforated by holes, and is exempt from insects and seeds--in such a place he should leave his excrements, &amp;c. (17, 18)</p>  
<p>The five Samitis are thus briefly enumerated, I shall now explain in due order the three Guptis&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_345"></A><A HREF="#fn_344"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. (19)</p>  
<p>1. There is, 1. truth; 2. untruth; 3. a mixture of truth and untruth; 4. a mixture of what is not true, and what is not untrue. The Gupti of mind refers to all four&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_346"></A><A HREF="#fn_345"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. (20)</p>  
<p>A zealous monk should prevent his mind from desires for the misfortune of somebody else&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_347"></A><A HREF="#fn_346"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, from thoughts on acts which cause misery to living beings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_348"></A><A HREF="#fn_347"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, and from thoughts on acts which cause their destruction&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_349"></A><A HREF="#fn_348"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>. (21)</p>  
<p>2. The Gupti of speech is also of four kinds (referring to the four divisions as in verse 20). (22)</p>  
<p>A zealous monk should prevent his speech from (expressing) desires, &amp;c. (as in verse 21). (23)</p>  
<p>3. In standing, sitting, lying down, jumping, going, and in the use of his organs, a zealous monk should prevent his body from intimating obnoxious desires,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="green">p. 136</font></A></p>  
<p>from doing acts which cause misery to living beings, or which cause their destruction. (24, 25)</p>  
<p>These are the five Samitis for the practice of the religious life, and the Guptis for the prevention of everything sinful. (26)</p>  
<p>This is the essence of the creed, which a sage should thoroughly put into practice; such a wise man will soon get beyond the Circle of Births. (27)</p>  
<p>Thus I say.</p>

<p>There are sixteen udgama-d&ocirc;shas by which food, &amp;c. becomes unfit for a <I>G</I>aina monk:</p>  
<p>1. &Acirc;dh&acirc;karmika, the fault inherent in food, &amp;c., which a layman has prepared especially for religious mendicants of whatever sect.</p>  
<p>2. Audd&ecirc;<I>s</I>ika, is food, &amp;c., which a layman has prepared for a particular monk.</p>

<p>6. Pr&acirc;bh<I>ri</I>tika, is food, &amp;c., which has been prepared for some festivity.</p>

<p>(Some of these faults are enumerated in the Aupap&acirc;tika S&ucirc;tra, &sect; 96, III.)</p>  
<p>There are sixteen utp&acirc;dana-d&ocirc;shas; or such faults as are occasioned by the monk's using some means to make the layman give him alms:</p>  
<p>1. Dh&acirc;tr&icirc;karman, when the monk plays with the layman's children.</p>

<p>15. Y&ocirc;gapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>a, when he teaches people spells, tricks, &amp;c.</p>  
<p>16. M&ucirc;lakarman, when he teaches them how to obviate evils by roots, charms, &amp;c.</p>  
<p>There are ten faults of graha<I>n</I>aisha<I>n</I>&acirc;:</p>  
<p>1. Sa&#7749;kita, when a monk accepts alms from a frightened layman.</p>  
<p>2. Mrakshita, when the food is soiled (khara<I>n</I><I>t</I>ita) by animate or inanimate matter.</p>  
<p>3. Nikshipta, when the food is placed among animate things.</p>  
<p>4. Pihita, when animate food is covered with inanimate matter, and vice versa.</p>  
<p>5. Sa<I>m</I>h<I>ri</I>ta, when the layman has to take out the thing to be given from one vessel and puts it into another.</p>
