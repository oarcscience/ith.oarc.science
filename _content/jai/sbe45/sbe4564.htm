<p>Now the Venerable One said: He who thus subdues his senses, who is well qualified (for his task)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_980"></A><A HREF="#fn_973"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and abandons his body, is to be called a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, a <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a, a Bhikshu, a Nirgrantha. (The pupil) replied: Why is he who thus subdues his senses, who is well qualified (for his task) and abandons his body, to be called a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, a <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a, a Bhikshu, a Nirgrantha? Tell this, O great sage! (1)</p>  
<p>He is a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a for this reason that he has ceased from all sinful actions, viz. love, hate, quarrel, calumny, backbiting, reviling of others, aversion to control, and love of pleasures, deceit, untruth, and the sin of wrong belief; that he possesses the Samitis, always exerts himself, is not angry, nor proud. (2)</p>  
<p>He is a <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a for this reason that he is not hampered by any obstacles, that he is free from desires, (abstaining from) property, killing, telling lies, and sexual intercourse; (and from) wrath, pride, deceit, greed, love, and hate: thus giving up every passion that involves him in sin, (such as) killing of beings. (Such a man) deserves the name of a <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a, who subdues (moreover) his senses, is well qualified (for his task), and abandons his body. (3)</p>

<p>He is a Bhikshu for this reason that he is not conceited, but modest, and obedient (to his Guru), that he subdues his senses, is well qualified (for his task), and abandons his body, that he sustains all troubles and calamities, that he practises with a pure mind the (prescribed) conduct, exerts himself well, is steadfast, and eats but a moderate quantity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_981"></A><A HREF="#fn_974"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of food which is given him by others. (Such a man) deserves the name of a Bhikshu. (4)</p>  
<p>He is a Nirgrantha for this reason that he is single&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_982"></A><A HREF="#fn_975"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, knowing the absolute (&acirc;tman), awakened, proof against sins, well disciplined; that he possesses the Samitis and equanimity, knows the true nature of the Self, is wise, has renounced the causes of sin both (objectively and subjectively&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_983"></A><A HREF="#fn_976"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>), does not desire honour, respect, and hospitality, but searches and knows the Law, endeavours to gain Liberation, and lives restrained. (Such a man) deserves the name of a Nirgrantha, who subdues his senses, is well qualified (for his task), and abandons his body. (5)</p>  
<p>Know this to be thus as I have told you, because I am the Saviour. (6)</p>  
<p>Thus I say.</p>
