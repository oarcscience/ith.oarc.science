<p>The wise (Arhat) having pondered on the Law proclaimed it; learn from me correctly what is carefulness. A monk who forms no resolutions and is possessed of carefulness, should wander about, giving no offence to any creature; (1)</p>  
<p>To no living beings, whether they move or not, whether above or below or on earth, by putting a strain upon them by his hands or feet&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_911"></A><A HREF="#fn_904"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Nor should he take from householders anything that is not freely given. (2)</p>  
<p>Having mastered the Law and got rid of carelessness, he should live on allowed food&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_912"></A><A HREF="#fn_905"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and treat</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_307"><font size="1" color="green">p. 307</font></A></p>  
<p>all beings as he himself would be treated; he should not expose himself to guilt by his desire for life; a monk who performs austerities should not keep any store. (3)</p>  
<p>Restraining his senses from women, a sage should wander about free from all worldly ties. See, every creature and every being suffers pain and is afflicted. (4)</p>  
<p>Doing harm to these beings, an ignorant man becomes involved in sins. Sin is committed by injuring (beings), and one sins also by employing others (in such acts). (5)</p>  
<p>He too who leads a miserable life, commits sin. Therefore (the <I>G</I>inas) have enjoined thorough carefulness. One should know the truth, delight in control and sound judgment, cease from injuring beings, and be of a settled mind. (6)</p>  
<p>Looking at all people with an impartial mind, one should not do anything to please or to harm them. After a virtuous beginning some become miserable and lose heart, (since) they desire honour and fame. (7)</p>  
<p>Desiring unallowed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_913"></A><A HREF="#fn_906"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> food and accepting such, the sinner, careless in his conduct, is attached to women, and tries to acquire property. (8)</p>  
<p>Given to violent deeds he accumulates (Karman); on his decease he (meets with) really distressing misery. Therefore a wise man considers well the Law; a sage wanders about free from all worldly ties. (9)</p>  
<p>He should not expose himself to guilt by his desire for life, but he should wander about without any attachment. Speaking after due consideration,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_308"><font size="1" color="green">p. 308</font></A></p>  
<p>and combating his worldly desires, he should say nothing that involves slaughter of living beings. (10)</p>  
<p>He should not desire unallowed food, and he should not mix with people who desire such; he should mortify his flesh, thinking (of his duty), and giving up his sorrows without regard (to worldly interests). (11)</p>  
<p>Try to realise that you are single and alone; thereby you will obtain Liberation; mind, this is no false assertion! This Liberation is not anything unreal, but the best thing. An ascetic is free from anger, and delights in the truth. (12)</p>  
<p>Abstain from sexual intercourse with women, do not acquire property; a man possessed of carefulness will, beyond doubt, be a saviour (to others) in all circumstances. (13)</p>  
<p>A monk having conquered aversion to control and delight in sensual objects&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_914"></A><A HREF="#fn_907"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, should bear all troubles caused by (pricking) grass, cold, heat, and insects; he should endure pleasant and unpleasant smells. (14)</p>  
<p>Guarding his speech and possessed of carefulness, acquiring (pure) L&ecirc;<I>s</I>y&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_915"></A><A HREF="#fn_908"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, he should wander about; he should not thatch a house for himself or for others, nor behave towards other people like a householder. (15)</p>  
<p>Questioned by somebody who maintains the unchangeable character of the soul&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_916"></A><A HREF="#fn_909"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, he should expound the true (doctrine); those who engage in works and</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_309"><font size="1" color="green">p. 309</font></A></p>  
<p>are held in worldly bondage, do not know the Law which leads to Liberation. (16)</p>  
<p>Men here have various opinions; (they adhere) to the doctrine of the Kriy&acirc;v&acirc;dins and Akriy&acirc;v&acirc;dins. The iniquity of an unrestrained sinner, who after having been born injures the body (of beings to procure his own happiness), goes on increasing. (17)</p>  
<p>Forgetting that his life will have an end, a rash and foolish man is full of selfishness; he toils day and night, greedy of wealth, as if he never should grow old or die. (18)</p>  
<p>Leave wealth and cattle, all relations and dear friends! (A man) always talks (about these things), and he is infatuated with them; but other people will take away his wealth. (19)</p>  
<p>As smaller beasts keep at a distance from a lion, being afraid of him, so a wise man keeps aloof from sin, well considering the Law. (20)</p>  
<p>A wise man who has become awakened should turn away from sin, when he considers the evils arising from slaughter and the great dangers entailed by his cruel disposition. (21)</p>  
<p>A sage setting out for the real good&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_917"></A><A HREF="#fn_910"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (viz. Liberation), should not speak untruth; this (rule, they say,) comprises Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a and the whole of carefulness. He should not do works, nor cause others to do them, nor assent to others doing them. (22)</p>  
<p>When he gets pure (food), he should not be affected (by love or hate), and he should not be too</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_310"><font size="1" color="green">p. 310</font></A></p>  
<p>fond (of such food) nor long for it. A pious monk, free from bonds, should wander about desiring neither honours nor fame. (23)</p>  
<p>A monk who has left the house and is free from desires should abandon his body, annihilating his sins; he should not desire life nor death, and walk about, having got beyond the Circle (of Births)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_918"></A><A HREF="#fn_911"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. (24)</p>  
<p>Thus I say.</p>
