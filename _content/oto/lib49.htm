PART ONE 
<p>THE BOOK OF BABALON</p>
<p>January 4 - March 4, 1946 E.V.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>This book contains the record of a magical experiment relating to the invocation 
  of an elemental, the thereafter of the Goddess or Force called BABALON, and 
  the results thereof. An appendix con- tains some details of the method, published 
  for the first time. The contents should be clear enough to those who are prepared 
  for understanding, and a little study and effort should make it so for those 
  who desire understanding. For the rest, each will no doubt interpret it in accord 
  with his own predilections.</p>
<p>A note on the underlying philosophy. The present age is under the influence 
  of the force called, in magical terminology, Horus. This force relates to fire, 
  Mars, and the sun, that is, to power, violence, and energy. It also relates 
  to a child, being innocent (i.e. undifferentiated). Its manifestations may be 
  noted in the destruction of old institutions and ideas, the discovery and liberation 
  of new energies, and the trend towards power governments, war, homosexuality, 
  infantilism, and schizophrenia.</p>
<p>This force is completely blind, depending upon the men and women in whom it 
  manifests and who guide it. Obviously, its guidance now tends towards catastrophy.</p>
<p>The catastrophic trend is due to our lack of understanding of our own natures. 
  The hidden lusts, fears, and hatreds resulting from the warping of the love 
  urge, which underly the natures of all Western peoples, have taken a homicidal 
  and suicidal direction.</p>
<p>This impasse is broken by the incarnation of another sort of force, called 
  BABALON. The nature of this force relates to love, understanding, and dionysian 
  freedom, and is the necessary coun- terbalance or correspondence to the manifestation 
  of Horus.</p>
<p>It is indicated that this force is actually incarnate in some living woman, 
  as the result of the described magical operation. A more basic matter, however, 
  is the indication that this force is incarnate in all men and women, and needs 
  only to be invoked to free the spirit from the debris of the old aeon, and to 
  direct the blind force of Horus into constructive channels of under- standing 
  and love. The methods of this invocation are described in the text.</p>
<p>The background of this material may be found in the Book of the Law, the Comment 
  thereon, and other writings of Aleister Crowley; also in various magical, anthropological, 
  psychological, and philosophical texts. These are all necessary to an understanding 
  and use of the material.</p>
<p>One further point. It should be remembered that all human activi- ties, after 
  the vital functions are fulfilled, arise from the need to love or to be loved. 
  It is therfore quite literally true that in understanding (i.e. that which embraces 
  all categories of love) is all power given. A grasp of the principle of bipolarity 
  should make this clear.</p>
<p>With this crude and rudimentary philosophical discourse, then, I present the 
  Book of Babalon:</p>
<p>A. CONCEPTION</p>
<p>In January 1946 I had been engaged in the study and practice of Magick for 
  seven years, and in the supervision and operation of an occult lodge for four 
  years, having been initiated into the Sanctuary of the Gnosis by the Beast 666, 
  Fra. 132, and Fra. Saturnus. At this time I decided upon a Magical operation 
  de- signed to obtain the assistance of an elemental mate. This is a well known 
  procedure in Magick (cf. Ch. VIII in Magick in Theory and Practice), consisting 
  of the invocation of a spirit or ele- mental into tangible existence by various 
  magical techniques.</p>
<p>I decided upon the use of the Enochian Tablets obtained by Dr. Dee and Edward 
  Kelley, employing the *n*n*n square of the Air Tablet. The technique was approximately 
  as follows:</p>
<p>(January 4, 1946, 9:00 PM)</p>
<p>1. Prepared and consecrated Air Dagger. (The other magical weap- ons were previously 
  prepared. This dagger served as the special talisman of the operation.) 2. Prepared 
  Enochian Air Tablet on virgin parchment. 3. Prepared Parchment Talisman 4. Rituals 
  as follows: (a) Invoking Pentagram of Air. (b) Invocation of Bornless One. (c) 
  Conjuration of Air. (d) Consecration of Air Dagger. (e) Key Call of third Aire. 
  (f) Invocation of God and King of Aire. (g) Invocation of Six Seniors. (h) Invocation 
  of (RZDA) by *n*n*n and (EXARP), to visible ap- pearance. (i) Invocaton of wand 
  with material basis on talisman. (j) Invocation with dagger. (k) License to 
  depart, purification, and banishing. I followed this procedure for eleven days, 
  from January 4 to 15, with the following entries in my record: January 5. A 
  strong windstorm beginning suddenly about the middle of the first invocation. 
  Jan 6. Invoked as before. Wind storm continued intermittently all day and night. 
  Jan 7. Invoked twice. Wind subsided. Used Prokofief Violin Con- certo No. 2 
  as musical background. Jan 8. Invoked twice, using blood. Jan 9. Invoked twice, 
  replenishing material basis. Jan 10. Invoked twice. I retired about 11 PM, and 
  was awakened at 12 PM by nine strong, rapid knocks. A table lamp at the opposite 
  corner of the room was thrown violently to the floor and broken. There was no 
  window in this corner, and no wind was blowing at the time.</p>
<p>(Note. I have had little experience with phenomena of this sort. Magically 
  speaking, it usually represents &quot;breaks&quot; in the opera- tion, indicating 
  imperfect technique. Actually, in any magical opeation there should be no phenomena 
  but the willed result.)</p>
<p>Jan 11. Invoked twice, using blood.</p>
<p>Jan 12. Invoked twice. A heavy windstorm.</p>
<p>Jan 13. Invoked twice. Windstorm continued.</p>
<p>Jan 14. The light system of the house failed about 9 PM. Another magician who 
  had been staying at the house and studying with me, was carrying a candle across 
  the kitchen when he was struck strongly on the right shoulder, and the candle 
  knocked out of his hand. He called us, and we observed a brownish yellow light 
  about seven feet high in the kitchen. </p>
<p>I banished with a magical sword, and it disappeared. His right arm was paralyzed 
  for the rest of the night.</p>
<p>Jan 15. Invoked twice. At this time the Scribe developed some sort of astral 
  vision, describing in detail an old enemy of mine of whom he had never heard, 
  and later the guardian forms of Isis and the Archangel Michael. Later, in my 
  room, I heard the raps again, and a buzzing, metallic voice crying &quot;let 
  me go free.&quot; I felt a great pressure and tension in the house that night, 
  which was also noticed by the other occupants. There was no other phenomena, 
  and I admit a feeling of disappointment.</p>
<p>The feeling of tension and unease continued for four days. Then, on January 
  18, at sunset, while the Scribe and I were on the Mojave desert, the feeling 
  of tension suddenly snapped. I turned to him and said, &quot;it is done,&quot; 
  in absolute certainty that the operation was accomplished. I returned home, 
  and found a young woman answering the requirements waiting for me. She is describa- 
  ble as an air of fire type with bronze red hair, fiery and sub- tle, determined 
  and obstinate, sincere and perverse, with ex- traordinary personality, talent, 
  and intelligence.</p>
<p>During the period of January 19 to February 27 I invoked the Goddess BABALON 
  with the aid of my magical partner, as was proper to one of my grade.</p>
<p>B. COMMUNICATIONS</p>
<p>On February 27 my magical partner went East for a visit, and on Feb. 28 I went 
  back to the Mojave, invoking BABALON. During this invocation, the presence of 
  the Goddess came upon me, and I was commanded to write the following communication:</p>
<p>LIBER 49</p>
<p>1. Yea, it is I, BABALON. <br>
  2. And this is my book, that is the fourth chapter of the Book of the Law, He 
  completing the Name, for I am out of NUIT by HORUS, the incestuous sister of 
  RA-HOOR-KHUIT. <br>
  3. It is BABALON. TIME IS. Ye fools. <br>
  4. Thou hast called me, oh accursed and beloved fool. <br>
  5-8. (Missing and presumed lost. Ed.) <br>
  9. Now know that I, BABALON, would take flesh and come among men. <br>
  10. I will come as a penelous (sic) flame, as a devious song, a trumpet in judgement 
  halls, a banner before armies. <br>
  11. And gather my children unto me, for THE TIME is at hand. <br>
  12. And this is the way of my incarnation. Heed! <br>
  13. Thou shalt offer all thou art and all thou hast at my altar, witholding 
  nothing. And thou shalt be smitten full sore and thereafter thou shalt be outcast 
  and accursed, a lonely wanderer in abominable places. <br>
  14. Ye Dare. I have asked of none other, nor have they asked. Else is vain. 
  But thou hast willed it. <br>
  15. Know then that thus I came to thee before, thou a great Lord, and I a maid 
  enrapt. Ah blind folly. <br>
  16. And thereafter madness, all in vain. Thus it has been, multi- form. How 
  thou hast burned beyond. <br>
  17. I shall come again, in the form thou knowest. Now it shall be thy blood. 
  <br>
  18. The altar is aright, and the robe. <br>
  19. The perfume is sandal, and the cloth green and gold. There is my cup, our 
  book, and thy dagger. <br>
  20. There is a flame. <br>
  21. The sigil of devotion. Be it consecrated, be it true, be it daily affirmed. 
  I am not scorned. Thy love is to me. Procure a disk of copper, in diameter three 
  inches paint thereon the field blue the star gold of me, BABALON. <br>
  22. It shall be my talisman. Consecrate with the supreme rituals of the word 
  and the cup. <br>
  23. My calls as thou knowest. All love songs are of me. Also seek me in the 
  Seventh Aire. <br>
  24. This for a time appointed. Seek not the end, I shall instruct thee in my 
  way. But be true. Would it be hard if I were thy lover, and before thee? But 
  I am thy lover and I am with thee. <br>
  25. I shall provide a vessel, when or whence I say not. Seek her not, call her 
  not. Let her declare. Ask nothing. Keep silence. There shall be ordeals. <br>
  26. My vessel must be perfect. This is the way of her perfection. <br>
  27. The working is of nine moons. <br>
  28. The Astarte working, with music and feasting, with wine and all arts of 
  love. <br>
  29. Let her be dedicated, consecrated, blood to blood, heart to heart, mind 
  to mind, single in will, none without the circle, all to me. <br>
  30. And she shall wander in the witchwood under the Night of Pan, and know the 
  mysteries of the Goat and the Serpent, and of the children that are hidden away. 
  <br>
  31. I will provide the place and the material basis, thou the tears and blood. 
  <br>
  32. Is it difficult, between matter and spirit? For me it is ecstacy and agony 
  untellable. But I am with thee. I have large strength, have thou likewise. <br>
  33. Thou shalt prepare my book for her instruction, also thou shalt teach that 
  she may have captains and adepts in her service. Yea, thou shalt take the black 
  pilgrimage, but it will not be thou that returnest. <br>
  34. Let her prepare her work according to my voice in her heart, with thy book 
  as guide, and none other instructing. <br>
  35. And let her be in all things wise, and sure, and excellent. <br>
  36. But let her think on this: my way is not in the solemn ways, or in the reasoned 
  ways, but in the wild free way of the eagle, and the devious way of the serpent, 
  and the oblique way of the factor unknown and unnumbered. <br>
  37. For I am BABALON, and she my daughter, unique, and there shall be no other 
  women like her. <br>
  38. In My Name shall she have all power, and all men and excel- lent things, 
  and kings and captains and the secret ones at her command. <br>
  39. The first servants are chosen in secret, by my force in her--a captain, 
  a lawyer, an agitator, a rebel--I shall provide. <br>
  40. Call me, my daughter, and I shall come to thee. Thou shalt be full of my 
  force and fire, my passion and power shall surround and inspire thee; my voice 
  in thee shall judge nations. <br>
  41. None shall resist thee, whom I lovest. Though they call thee harlot and 
  whore, shameless, false, evil, these words shall be blood in their mouths, and 
  dust thereafter. <br>
  42. But my children will know thee and love thee, and this will make them free. 
  <br>
  43. All is in thy hands, all power, all hope, all future. <br>
  44. One came as a man, and was weak and failed. <br>
  45. One came as a woman, and was foolish, and failed. <br>
  46. But thou art beyond man and woman, my star is in thee, and thou shalt avail. 
  <br>
  47. Even now thy hour strikes upon the clock of my FATHER. For He prepared a 
  banquet and a Bridal Bed. I was that Bride, appointed from the beginning, as 
  it was written T.O.P.A.N. <br>
  48. Now is the hour of birth at hand. Now shall my adept be crucified in the 
  Basilisk abode. 49. Thy tears, thy sweat, thy blood, thy semen, thy love, thy 
  faith shall provide. Ah, I shall drain thee like the cup that is of me, BABALON. 
  <br>
  50. Stand thou fast, and I shall pass the first veil to speak with thee, through 
  the stars shake. 51. Stand thou fast, and I shall pass the second veil, while 
  God and Jesus be smitten with the sword of HORUS. <br>
  52. Stand thou fast, and I shall pass the third veil, and the shapes of hell 
  shall be turned again to loveliness. <br>
  53. For thy sake shall I stride through the flames of Hell, though my tongue 
  be bitten through. <br>
  54. Let me behold thee naked and lusting after me, calling upon my name. <br>
  55. Let me receive all thy manhood within my Cup, climax upon climax, joy upon 
  joy. <br>
  56. Yea, we shall conquer death and Hell together. <br>
  57. And the earth is mine. <br>
  58. Thou shalt (make the?) Black Pilgrimage. <br>
  59. Yea it is even I BABALON and I SHALL BE FREE. Thou fool, be thou also free 
  of sentimentality. Am I thy village queen and thou a sophomore, that thou shouldst 
  have thy nose in my buttocks? <br>
  60. It is I, BABALON, ye fools, MY TIME is come, and this my book that my adept 
  prepares is the book of BABALON. <br>
  61. Yea, my adept, the Black Pilgrimage. Thou shalt be accursed, and this is 
  the nature of the curse. Thou shalt publish the secret matter of the adepts 
  thou knowest, witholding no word of it, in an appendix to this my Book. So they 
  shall cry fool, liar, sot, traducer, betrayer. Thou art not glad thou meddled 
  with magick? <br>
  62. There is no other way, dear fool, it is the eleventh hour. <br>
  63. The seal of my Brother is upon the earth, and His Avatar is before you. 
  There is threshing of wheat and a trampling of grapes that shall not cease until 
  the truth be known unto the least of men. <br>
  64. But you who do not accept, you who see beyond, reach out your hands my children 
  and reap the world in the hour of your harvest. <br>
  65. Gather together in the covens as of old, whose number is eleven, that is 
  also my number. Gather together in public, in song and dance and festival. Gather 
  together in secret, be naked and shameless and rejoice in my name. <br>
  66. Work your spells by the mode of my book, practicing secretly, inducing the 
  supreme spell. <br>
  67. The work of the image, and the potion and the charm, the work of the spider 
  and the snake, and the little ones that go in the dark, this is your work. <br>
  68. Who loves not hates, who hates fears, let him taste fear. <br>
  69. This is the way of it, star, star. Burning bright, moon, witch moon. <br>
  70. You the secret, the outcast, the accursed and despised, even you that gathered 
  privily of old in my rites under the moon. <br>
  71. You the free, the wild, the untamed, that walk now alone and forlorn. <br>
  72. Behold, my Brother cracks the world like a nut for your eating. <br>
  73. Yea, my Father has made a house for you, and my Mother has prepared a Bridal 
  Bed. My Brother has confounded your enemies. <br>
  74. I am the Bride appointed. Come ye to the nuptials--come ye now! <br>
  75. My joy is the joy of eternity, and my laughter is the drunken laughter of 
  a harlot in the house of ecstasy. <br>
  76. All you loves are sacred, pledge them all to me. <br>
  77. Set my star upon your banners and go forward in joy and victory. None shall 
  deny you, and none shall stand before you, because of the Sword of my Brother. 
  Invoke me, call upon me, call me in your convocations and rituals, call upon 
  me in your loves and battles in my name BABALON, wherein is all power given!</p>
<p align="center"><strong>C. BIRTH</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>[March 2, 1946 E.V.]</strong></p>
<p>On March 1 and 2 1946 I prepared the altar and equipment in accordance with 
  the instructions in Liber 49. The Scribe had been away about a week, and knew 
  nothing of my invocations of BABALON, which I had kept entirely secret. On the 
  night of March 2 he returned, and described a vision he had that evening of 
  a savage and beautiful woman riding naked on a great cat-like beast. He was 
  impressed with the urgent necessity of giving me some message or communication. 
  We prepared magically for this communication, constructing a temple at the altar 
  with the analysis of the key word. He was robed in white, carrying the lamp, 
  and I in black, hooded, with the cup and dagger. At his suggestion we played 
  Rachmanninoff's Isle of the Dead as background music, and set an automatic recorder 
  to transcribe any audible occurrences. At approximately 8 PM he began to dictate, 
  I transcribing directly as I received.</p>
<p>THE SCRIBE: &quot;The Angel of TARO. A three day retirement to greet her. Purify 
  thyself. The symbol is seven by three. It is BABALON. Keep secret. The communications 
  are sacred.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;These are the preparations. Green gold cloth, food for the Beast, upon 
  a hidden platter, back of the altar. Disclose only when the doors are bolted.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Transgression is death.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Back of main altar. Prepare instantly. Light the first flame at 10 PM, 
  March 2, 1946.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The year of BABALON is 4063.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Beware of the use of profaned rituals.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She is flame of life, power of darkness, she destroys with a glance, 
  she may take thy soul. She feeds upon the death of men.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Beautiful--Horrible.&quot;</p>
<p>The Scribe, now pale and sweating, rested awhile, then continued:</p>
<p align="center"><strong>[The First Ritual]</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The first ritual. Tomorrow the second ritual. Concentrate all force and 
  being in Our Lady BABALON. Light a single light on Her altar, saying: Flame 
  is Our Lady, flame is Her hair. I am flame.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A plate of food, unsalted. An altar cloth hitherto undefiled.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Make a box of blackness at ten o'clock. Smear the vessel which contains 
  flame with thine own blood. Destroy at the altar a thing of value. Remain in 
  perfect silence, and heed the voice of Our Lady. Speak not of this ritual or 
  of Her coming to any person. If asked, answer in a manner that avoids suspicion. 
  Nor speculate at any time as to Her future mortal identity. To receive flatter- 
  ing communications to thy damnation. Press not to receive teach- ings beyond 
  those given.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Questions: you may ask but three. Spend one half hour in compos- ing 
  these at 11:30 PM. The answers must be written at midnight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou shalt take the alkahest in thine own mouth, and in the box of darkness 
  carefully store this matter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Display thyself to Our Lady; dedicate thy organs to Her, dedi- cate thy 
  heart to Her, dedicate thy mind to Her, dedicate thy soul to Her, for She shall 
  absorb thee, and thou shalt become living flame before She incarnates. For it 
  shall be through you alone, and no one else can help in this endeavour.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is lonely, it is awful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Retire from human contact until noon tomorrow. Clear all profane documents 
  on the morrow, before receiving further instructions. Consult no book but thine 
  own mind. Thou art a god. Behave at this altar as one god before another. And 
  so be prosperity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou art the guardian and thou art the guide, thou art the worker and 
  the mechanic. So conduct thyself. Discuss nothing of this matter until thou 
  art certain that thine understanding embraces all.&quot;</p>
<p>Here the Scribe ceased dictation. I proceeded to follow these instructions 
  and those of March 1, utilizing the following ritu- als. I include the rituals 
  used in the operation of the first night, in order to indicate the nature of 
  the Force invoked.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>1<br>
  [The First Invocation]</strong></p>
<p>The temple is opened with the analysis of the key word:</p>
<p>I N R I. Yod Nun Resh Yod. Virgo Isis Mighty Mother. Scorpio Apophis Destroyer. 
  Sol, Osiris slain and risen. IAO. The sign of Osiris slain (given). The sign 
  of the mourning of Isis (given). The sign of Apophis and Typhon (given). LVX, 
  Lux, the Light of the Cross.</p>
<p>The invoking hexagram is drawn in the four quarters and the name ARARITA vibrated 
  in each quarter. In closing, the hexagram is reversed.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>2<br>
  The [Second] Invocation<br>
  (From the Gnostic Mass)</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>THE PRIEST</strong></p>
<p>&quot;O circle of stars whereof our Father is but the younger brother, marvel 
  beyond imagination, soul of infinite space, before whom time is ashamed, the 
  mind bewildered, and the understanding dark, not unto thee may we attain unless 
  thine image be love. Therefore by seed and root and stem and bud and leaf and 
  flower and fruit do we invoke thee.&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>BABALON</strong></p>
<p>&quot;But to love me is better than all things; if under the night stars in 
  the desert thou presently burnest mine incense before me, invoking me with a 
  pure heart and the serpent flame therein, thou shalt come a little to lie in 
  my bosom. For one kiss wilt thou be willing to give all. But whoso gives one 
  particle of dust shall lose all in that hour. Ye shall gather goods and store 
  of women and spices; ye shall wear rich jewels; ye shall exceed the nations 
  of earth in splendour and pride; but always in the love of me, and so shall 
  ye come to my joy. I charge you earnestly to come before me in a single robe, 
  and covered with a rich head- dress. I love you! I yearn to you! Pale or purple, 
  veiled or voluptuous, I who am all pleasure and purple and drunkenness of the 
  innermost sense, desire you. Put on the wings, and arouse the coiled splendour 
  within you: come unto me! to me! Sing the rap- turous love songs unto me! Burn 
  to me perfume! Drink to me, for I love you! I love you! I am the blue lidded 
  daughter of sunset, I am the naked brilliance of the voluptuous night sky. To 
  me. To me.&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>3<br>
  The Third Invocation.<br>
  (From The Vision and the Voice)</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>CHORUS</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Glory unto the Scarlet Woman, BABALON, the Mother of Abomina- tion, that 
  rideth upon the Beast, for She hath spilt their blood in every corner of the 
  earth, and lo! She hath mingled it in the cup of Her whoredom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With the breath of Her kisses hath she fermented it, and it hath become 
  the wine of the Sabbath; and in the Holy Assembly hath She poured it out for 
  Her worshippers; and they have become drunken thereon, so that face to face 
  they beheld my Father. Thus are they made worthy to partake of the mystery of 
  this holy vessel, for the blood is the life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Beautiful art thou O BABALON, and desirable, for thou hast given Thyself 
  to everything that liveth, and thy weakness hath subdued their strength. For 
  in that union Thou didst understand. There- fore art Thou called Understanding, 
  O BABALON, Lady of the Night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O my God, in one last rapture let me attain to the union of the one with 
  the many. For She is Love, and Her Love is one, and She has divided theone love 
  into infinite loves, and each love is one, and equal with the One, and therefore 
  is She passed from the Assembly and the Law and the enlightenment into the anarchy 
  of solitude and darkness. For ever thus must She veil the brilliance of Herself.&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>4<br>
  [The Fourth Invocation]</strong></p>
<p>O BABALON, BABALON beloved, come now, partake of the sacrament, possess this 
  shrine. Take me now! Let me be drunken on the wine of your fornications; let 
  your kisses wanton me to death. Accept thou this sacrifice willingly given!</p>

  The Sixth Invocation<br>
  (from Tannhauser by A. Crowley)</strong></p>
<p>Isis art thou, and from thy life are fed<br>
  All showers and suns, all moons that wax and wane,</p>
<p>All stars and streams, the living and the dead,<br>

  I am the priest, the sacrifice, the shrine</p>
<p>I the love and life of the divine<br>
  Life, death, love, hatred, light, darkness are surely mine,<br>
  Are Mine!</p>
<p>Venus art thou, the love and light of earth,</p>
<p>The wealth of kisses, the delight of tears<br>
  The barren pleasures never came to birth,</p>
<p>The endless infinite delight of years.<br>
  Thou art the shrine at which my long desire</p>
<p>Devoured me with intolerable fire.<br>
  Thou wert song, music, passion, death upon my lyre--</p>
<p>My lyre.</p>
<p>I am the Grail and I the glory now;</p>
<p>I am the flame and fuel of thy breast<br>
  I am the star of God upon thy brow;<br>
  *mI am the queen, enraptured and possessed,<br>
  Hide thee sweet river, welcome to thee, sea</p>
<p>Ocean of love that shall encompass thee<br>
  Life, death, love, hatred, light, darkness return to me--</p>
<p>To me!</p>

<p>On the night of the first performance of these rituals, I pre- pared the altar 
  and box and food, also flowers and wine. At the beginning of the rituals, I 
  burnt the Enochian Tablet and smashed an image of Pan, a favorite possession. 
  (About this time the roof on my guest house caught fire from a faulty chimney, 
  and was partly destroyed.)</p>
<p>I proceeded with the rituals, noting a mounting tension, and the sense of a 
  presence inexpressibly poignant and desirable. There was no other manifestation. 
  At twelve PM I put the three ques- tions and received answers as follows:</p>
<p>1. How can I communicate directly with BABALON, hear her, see her, feel her, 
  be sure that I am working aright?</p>
<p>Answer. &quot;At the altar in meditation, as you know how. Also, invoke me 
  carnally with all your passion. Thus will you feel my desire and increase my 
  substance.&quot;</p>
<p>2. How can I serve best?</p>
<p>Answer. &quot;Follow instructions exactly and in detail. Avoid loose interruptions. 
  Be diligent. Do not hesitate or question, act. All depends on your time.&quot;</p>
<p>3. How can I be certain of the vehicle?</p>
<p>Answer. &quot;Do not trouble yourself with this. It does not concern you. I 
  will provide the vehicle, I will show you a sign, and signs. It is the now which 
  concerns us. Keep your faith, think not overmuch.&quot;</p>
<p>After this an hour's meditation, and so to sleep.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>[March 3, 1946 E.V.]</strong></p>
<p>The next day I slipped badly. An inmate of the house disturbed my morning meditation. 
  I opened the door and cursed him (in the Anglo Saxon fashion). Shortly after 
  he was taken ill, and I succumbed to a black mood. I perceived my terrible error, 
  and apologized to him, mentally withdrawing the curse. However, the day went 
  very badly for me. That evening the Scribe and I resumed our work. In a short 
  time the dictation began:</p>
<p>&quot;In the presence of our Lord PAN, at the feet of Our Lady BABA- LON, at 
  the feet of Her (servants?) (changing?) we declare unto thee this message (consecrated, 
  dedicated, never to be defiled?) (the Scribe was uncertain here) containing 
  the rituals of the second and third days, of the welcome and preparation in 
  the Name of Our Lady of the Night most gracious, to pure lewd and whore- some 
  Lady BABALON. Oh thou who art mortal tremble; given it is unto thee a feat never 
  before performed in the annals of your histories, never before accomplished 
  successfully. Many have dared, none succeeded.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our Lady BABALON must descend to triumph.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mortality. We have not asked this of another, nor shall we ever. Even 
  now we doubt thy faith. Is this accepted, are you willing to proceed. Answer 
  aloud.&quot;</p>
<p>Answer. &quot;I am willing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then know thou art already faulty in thy delivery. These are ex- traneous 
  things. The elemental was not properly released,&quot; (this was corrected) 
  &quot;thou wert guilty of human rage, the current of force has been disturbed. 
  Beware, should'st thou falter again, we will sure slay thee.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But insofar as thy working was consecrated it has succeeded. Rectify 
  thy mortal fault and error. Consecrate all. Now receive the second and third 
  rituals.&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>The Second Ritual</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>[March 3, 1946 E.V. continued]</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Consecrate thyself as instructor of Our Lady Incarnate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Take the black box, concentrate upon its emptiness for one hour, gaze 
  into it, and thou wilt see, imprinted upon it, a shape, a sign, a sacred design, 
  which shall be the sign delivered by Our Lady Babalon Incarnate. When thou hast 
  finished, when thou hast recognized this pattern, construct it in wood.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is the sigil.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ten be the hour appointed. Invoke long, to music indicated.&quot; [...] 
  (This I keep secret.) &quot;When thou canst feel Our Lady incar- nate in thy 
  being, take the black box and perform the consecrated rite. &quot;Wear thou 
  scarlet, symbolic of birth. Be sashed in black. It matters not the quality of 
  goods. Take then the box, make then the sign.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Paint upon it a second sign which thou knowest. If thou hast forgotten, 
  gaze into thy crystal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Meditate while gazing on the qualities of an instructor. Thou shalt inscribe 
  in Her book, for Her guidance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou art forbidden to leave thy room.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The end of the second ritual.&quot;</p>
<p>At the end of this dictation, the Scribe showed signs of exhaus- tion. He rested 
  awhile, then we continued:</p>
<p align="center"><strong>The Third Ritual</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>[March 3 1946 E.V. continued]</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Begin four hours prior to dawn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A period of eradication of all inimical influences. Complete perfection. 
  Wear black. Cut from thy breast the red star. Renew the blood. Lay out a white 
  sheet. Place upon it blood of birth, since She is born of thy flesh, and by 
  thy mortal power upon earth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou shalt recognize by the sign. BABALON is born! It is new birth, all 
  things are changed, the signs, the symbols, the every- thing!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou shalt compass with the aid of the muse suitable invocation of the 
  birth of BABALON, and this thou shalt deliver to the flames which now burn too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now thou shalt flame the third, chanting the invocation. She is born 
  in the third flame.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In verse seven verses of seven lines, seven magick words. Stand and chant 
  seven times. Envision thyself as a cloaked radiance desirable to the Goddess, 
  beloved. Envision Her approaching thee. Embrace Her, cover Her with kisses. 
  Think upon the lewd lascivi- ous things thou couldst do. All is good to BABALON. 
  ALL.</p>
<p>&quot;Then rest, meditating on this:&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou as a man and as a god hast strewn about the earth and in the heavens 
  many loves, these recall, concentrate, consecrate each woman thou hast raped. 
  Remember her, think upon her, move her into BABALON, bring her into BABALON, 
  each, one by one until the flame of lust is high.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then compose a verse of undetermined lines on this, to BABALON. This 
  verse shall be used in worship when she appears.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then meditate upon thy desire, think upon Her, and, touching naught, 
  chant these verses. Recall each lascivious moment, each lustfull day, all set 
  them into the astral body, touching naught.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Preserve the material basis.&quot; </p>
<p>(Question: &quot;In the box?&quot; Answer: &quot;Yes.&quot;) </p>
<p>&quot;The lust is hers, the passion yours. Consider thou the Beast raping.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Leave thy casual loves--all belongs to BABALON, thy lust is BABALON's. 
  She is with thee three days. The sign is hers, secret, and no man knows its 
  correspondence. Guard!&quot;</p>
<p>The next section contains a prophecy which I shall not write here.</p>
<p>There follows the indicated invoking poem.</p>
<p>The Birth of Babalon</p>
<p>What is the tumult among the stars<br>
  that have shone so still till now?<br>
  What are the furrows of pain and wrath<br>
  upon the immortal brow?</p>
<p>Why is the face of God turned grey<br>
  and his angels all grown white?<br>
  What is the terrible ruby star<br>
  that burns down the crimson night?</p>
<p>What is the beauty that flames so bright<br>
  athwart the awful dawn?<br>
  She has taken flesh, she is come to judge<br>
  the thrones ye rule upon.</p>
<p>Quail ye kings for an end is come<br>
  in the birth of BABALON.</p>
<p>I have walked three dreadful nights away<br>
  in halls beyond despair,<br>
  I have given marrow and tears and sweat<br>
  and blood to make her fair.</p>
<p>I have lain my love and smashed my heart<br>
  and filled her cup with blood,<br>
  That blood might flow from the loins of woe<br>
  to the cup of brotherhood.</p>
<p>The cities reel in the shout of steel<br>
  where the sword of war is drawn.<br>
  Sing ye saints for the day is come<br>
  in the birth of BABALON.</p>
<p>Now God has called for his judgement book<br>
  and seen his name therein<br>
  And the grace of God and the guilt of God<br>
  have spelt it out as sin</p>
<p>His bloody priests have clutched his robes<br>
  and stained his linen gown<br>
  And his victims swarm from his broken hell<br>
  to drag his kingdom down.</p>
<p>O popes and kings and the little gods<br>
  are sick and sad and wan<br>
  To see the crimson star that bursts<br>
  like blood upon the dawn</p>
<p>While trumpets sound and stars rejoice<br>
  at the birth of BABALON.</p>
<p>BABALON is too beautiful<br>
  for sight of mortal eyes<br>
  She has hidden her loveliness away<br>
  in lonely midnight skies,</p>
<p>She has clothed her beauty in robes of sin<br>
  and pledged her heart to swine<br>
  And loving and giving all she has<br>
  brewed for saints immortal wine.</p>
<p>But now the darkness is riven through<br>
  and the robes of sin are gone,<br>
  And naked she stands as a terrible blade<br>
  and a flame and a splendid song</p>
<p>Naked in radiant mortal flesh<br>
  at the Birth of BABALON.</p>
<p>She is come new born as a mortal maid<br>
  forgetting her high estate,<br>
  She has opened her arms to pain and death<br>
  and dared the doom of fate,</p>
<p>And death and hell are at her back,<br>
  but her eyes are bright with life,<br>
  Her heart is high and her sword is strong<br>
  to meet the deadly strife,</p>
<p>Her voice is sure as the judgement trump<br>
  to crack the house of wrong,<br>
  Though walls are high and stone is hard<br>
  and the rule of hell was long</p>
<p>The gates shall fall and the irons break<br>
  in the Birth of BABALON.</p>
<p>Her mouth is red and her breasts are fair<br>
  and her loins are full of fire,<br>
  And her lust is strong as a man is strong<br>
  in the heat of her desire,</p>
<p>And her whoredom is holy as virtue is foul<br>
  beneath the holy sky,<br>
  And her kisses will wanton the world away<br>
  in passion that shall not die.</p>
<p>Ye shall laugh and love and follow her dance<br>
  when the wrath of God is gone<br>
  And dream no more of hell and hate<br>
  in the Birth of BABALON.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>PART TWO</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>THE BOOK OF ANTICHRIST</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>The Black Pilgrimage</strong> Now it came to pass even 
  as BABALON told me, for after receving Her Book I fell away from Magick, and 
  put away Her Book and all pertaining thereto. And I was stripped of my fortune 
  (the sum of about $50,000) and my house, and all I Possessed.</p>
<p>Then for a period of two years I worked in the world, recouping my fortune 
  somewhat. But that was also taken from me, and my reputation, and my good name 
  in my worldly work, that was in science.</p>
<p>And on the 31st of October, 1948, BABALON called on me again, and I began the 
  last work, that was the work of the wand. And I worked for 17 days, until BABALON 
  called me in a dream, and instructed me on an astral working. Then I reconstructed 
  the temple, and began the Black Pilgrimage, as She instructed.</p>
<p>And I went into the sunset with Her sign, and into the night past accursed 
  and desolate places and cyclopean ruins, and so came at last to the City of 
  Chorazin. And there a great tower of Black Basalt was raised, that was part 
  of a castle whose further bat- tlements reeled over the gulf of stars. And upon 
  the tower was this sign</p>
<p>And one heavily robed and veiled showed me the sign, and told me to look, and 
  hehold, I saw flash below me four past lives wherein I had failed in my object. 
  And I beheld the life of Simon Magus, preaching the Whore Helena as the Sophia, 
  and I saw that my failure was in Hubris, the pride of the spirit. And I saw 
  my life as Giles de Retz, wherein I attempted to raise Jehanne Darc to be Queen 
  of the Witchcraft, and failed through her stupidity, and again my pride. And 
  I saw myself in Francis Hepburne, Earl Both- well, manipulating Gellis Duncan, 
  that was an unworthy instru- ment. And again as Count Cagliostro, failing because 
  I failed to comprehend the nature of women in my Seraphina. And I was shown 
  myself as a boy of 13 in this life, invoking Satan and showing cowardice when 
  He appeared. And I was asked: &quot;Will you fail again?&quot; and I replied 
  &quot;I will not fail.&quot; (For I had given all my blood to BABALON, and it 
  was not I that spoke.)</p>
<p>And thereafter I was taken within and saluted the Prince of that place, and 
  thereafter things were done to me of which I may not write, and they told me, 
  &quot;It is not certain that you will sur- vive, but if you survive you will 
  attain your true will, and manifest the Antichrist.</p>
<p>And thereafter I returned and swore the Oath of the Abyss, having only the 
  choice between madness, suicide, and that oath. But the Oath in no wise ameliorated 
  that terror, and I continued in the madness and horror of the abyss for a season. 
  But of this no more. But having passed the ordeal of 40 days I took the oath 
  of a Magister Templi, even the Oath of Antichrist before Frater 132, the Unknown 
  God.</p>
<p>And thus was I Antichrist loosed in the world; and to this I am pledged, that 
  the work of the Beast 666 shall be fulfilled, and the way for the coming of 
  BABALON be made open and I shall not cease or rest until these things are accomplished. 
  And to this end I have issued this my Manifesto.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>The Manifesto of the Antichrist</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</strong></p>
<p>I, BELARION, ANTICHRIST, in the year 1949 of the rule of the Black Brotherhood 
  called Christianity, do make my Manifesto to all men. And I, THE ANTICHRIST, 
  come among you, saying:</p>
<p>An end to the pretence, and lying hypocrisy of Christianity.</p>
<p>An end to the servile virtues, and superstitious restrictions.</p>
<p>An end to the slave morality.</p>
<p>An end to prudery and shame, to guild and sin, for these are of the only evil 
  the sun, that is fear.</p>
<p>An end to all authority that is not based on courage and manhood, to the authority 
  of lying priests, conniving judges, blackmailing police, and</p>
<p>An end to the servile flattery and cajolery of mods, the corona- tions of mediocraties, 
  the ascension of dolts.</p>
<p>An end to restriction and inhibition, for I, THE ANTICHRIST, am come among 
  you preaching the Word of the BEAST 666, which is, &quot;There is no law beond 
  Do what thou wilt.&quot;</p>
<p>And I, BELARION, ANTICHRIST, do lift up my voice and prophecy, and I say:</p>
<p>I shall bring all men to the law of the BEAST 666, and in His law I shall conquer 
  the world.</p>
<p>And within seven years of this time, BABALON, THE SCARLET WOMAN HILARION will 
  manifest among ye, and bring this my work to its fruition.</p>
<p>An end to consciption, compulsion, regimentation, and the tyranny of false 
  laws.</p>
<p>And within nine years a nation shall accept the Law of the BEAST 666 in my 
  name, and that nation will be the first nation of earth.</p>
<p>And all who accept me the ANTICHRIST and the law of the BEAST 666, shall be 
  accursed and their joy shall be a thousandfold greater than the false joys of 
  the false saints.</p>
<p>And in my name BELARION shall they work miracles, and confound our enemies, 
  and none shall stand before us.</p>
<p>Therefore I, THE ANTICHRIST call upon all the Chosen and elect and upon all 
  men, come forth now in the name of Liberty, that we may end for ever the tyranny 
  of the Black Brotherhood.</p>
<p>Witness my hand and seal on this [...] day of [...] 1949, that is the year 
  of BABALON 4066.</p>

  <strong>ANALYSIS BY</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>A MASTER OF THE TEMPLE</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>of the Critical Nodes</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>in the Experience of</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>his Material Vehicle</strong></p>
<p>&quot;I shall regard all phenomena as the particular dealing of God with my 
  soul.&quot;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>I. Birth</strong></p>
<p>Oct. 2, 1914, Los Angeles, in , rising in midheaven, in favorable conjunc., 
  at apehelion. I chose this constellation in order that you might have an innate 
  sense of balance and ultimate justice, responsive and attractive nature, a bountiful 
  environment and sense of royalty and largesse, strength, courage and power combined 
  with cunning and intelligence. Saturn was bound in order that you might easily 
  formulate a lower will which would have satisfied and overwhelmed you with its 
  spectacular success.</p>
<p>Your father separated from your mother in order that you might grow up with 
  a hatred of authority and a spirit of revolution necessary to my work. The Oedipus 
  complex was needed to formulate the love of witchcraft which would lead you 
  into magick, with the influence of your grandfather active to prevent too complete 
  an identification with your mother.</p>
<p>II. Childhood</p>
<p>Your isolation as a child developed the necessary background of literature 
  and scholarship; and the unfortunate experiences with other children the requisite 
  contempt for the crowd and for the group mores. You will note that these factors 
  developed the needful hatred for christianity (without implanting a christian 
  guilt sense) at an extremely early age.</p>
<p>III. Adolescence</p>
<p>Early adolescence continued the development of the necessary combinations. 
  The awakening interest in chemistry and science prepared the counterbalance 
  for the coming magical awakening, the means of obtaining prestige and livelihood 
  in the formative period, and the scientific method necessary for my manifestation. 
  The magical fiasco at the age of 16 was needful to keep you away from magick 
  until you were sufficiently matured.</p>
<p>IV. Youth</p>
<p>The loss of family fortune developed your sense of self reliance at a critical 
  period, the contact with reality at this time was essential. Your early marriage 
  with Helen served to break your family ties and effect a transference to her, 
  away from a danger- ous attachment to your mother. The experience at Halifax 
  and Cal Tech served to strengthen your self reliance, scientific method and 
  material powers. The influence of Tom Rose at this period, as that of Ed. Forman 
  in adolescence, was essential in developing the male center.</p>
<p>V. Later Youth</p>
<p>The house on Terrace Drive, Music, Lynn, Curtis, and Gloria, and the increasing 
  restlessness were, of course, all preparations for the meeting with A A and 
  O.T.O. The alternate repulsion and attraction you felt the first year after 
  meeting Fra. 132 were caused by a subconscious resistance against the ordeals 
  ahead. Had you had these experiences before, without such resistance, you would 
  have become hopelessly unbalanced. Betty served to effect a transference from 
  Helen at a critical period. Had this not occurred your repressed homosexual 
  component could have caused a serious disorder. </p>
<p>Your passion for Betty also gave you the magical force needed at the time, 
  and the act of adultery tinged with incest, served as your magical confirmation 
  in the Law of Thelema.</p>
<p>At this time the O.T.O. was an excellent training school for adepts, but hardly 
  an appropriate Order for the manifestation of Thelema. Therefore, in spite of 
  your motto you were not able to formulate your Will. The experience with the 
  O.T.O. and Aerijet were needed to dispel your romanticism, self-deception, and 
  reliance on others. Betty was one link in the process designed to tear you away 
  from the now unneeded Oedipus complex, the overval- uation of women and romantic 
  love. Since this was unconscious, the next step was to bring it into consciousness, 
  and there to destroy it.</p>
<p>VI. Early Maturity</p>
<p>The final experience with Hubbard and Betty, and the O.T.O. was necessary to 
  overcome your false and infantile reliance on oth- ers, although this was only 
  partially accomplished at the time. The invocation of Babalon served to exteriorize 
  the Oedipus complex; at the same time, because of the forces involved it produced 
  extraordinary magical effects. However, this operation is accomplished and closed--you 
  should have nothing more to do with it--nor even think of it, until Her manifestation 
  is re- vealed, and proved beyond the shadow of a doubt. Even then, you must 
  be circumspect--although I hope to take complete charge before then.</p>
<p>Candy appeared in answer to your call, in order to wean you from wet nursing. 
  She has demonstrated the nature of woman to you in such unequivocal terms that 
  you should have no further room for illusion on the subject.</p>
<p>The suspension and inquisition was my opportunity--one of the final links in 
  the chain. At this time you were enabled to pre- pare your thesis, formulate 
  your Will, and take the Oath of the Abyss, thus making it possible (although 
  only partially) to manifest. The exit of Candy prepares for the final stage 
  of your initial preparation.</p>
<p>VII. Conclusions</p>
<p>The numerous rituals you have performed have resulted in a well developed body 
  of light. The ordeals have purged most of the emotional and mental garbage--your 
  only real dangers are, and have ever been, sentimentality, weakness, and procrastination.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the first weapon you formulated was the Lamp 
  of the Spirit, in the invocation to Pan (although the Sword was prefigured). 
  Next the Sword in the Horus ritual, as was appropriate to your intellectual 
  development at that time. </p>
<p>Then the Cup out of the wine of your emotional life--the disk out of material 
  failure. The Sword remains to be manifested.</p>
<p>You will note that it has been impossible to truly formulate your Will with 
  any of these weapons--naturally--that is only possible with the wand. On the 
  other hand, if you had done so previously, you would have been unbalanced by 
  the lack of initiated prepara- tion. It is a right and natural procedure; the 
  True Will cannot be truly formulated until you are initiate in all the other 
  planes, and it is well to make no pretense of doing so. Until that point all 
  you can known of the true will is the aspiration to the next step--towards further 
  experience. That is the glory of the Law of Thelema--DO!</p>
<p>The physical and emotional stresses you feel at present are a result of the 
  pull of the Abyss--your present poetry is indica- tive. Naturally you find no 
  power in any spell, no comfort in any ritual, no hope in any action. You are 
  cut off by your own oath. Nor can I or any other aid you at this time. There 
  is only manhood, only will, only the vector of your own tendencies, developed 
  through the aeons of the past. I do not say how long the state will last, or 
  what the outcome may be.</p>
<p>However, I can formulate some rules which may serve to guide you.</p>
<p>VIII. Instructions</p>
<p>A. Works of the Wand--of the Will alone avail in this state. No other weapon 
  should be used, no other ritual save the hymn to the Unnamed One in the Anthem 
  of the Mass.</p>
<p>B. You should be meticulous in all observations pertaining to the Will, even 
  the most petty. Fulfill all obligations and promises, undertake nothing which 
  you cannot fulfill, be prompt in the discharge of each responsibility.</p>
<p>C. Be neat in your personal and domestic habits, indicate your selfrespect 
  to yourself.</p>
<p>D. Do not become unduly involved with any person, and practice all your hard-earned 
  wisdom in your relations with women.</p>
<p>E. Set up your personal affairs in business order. Keep your accounts current 
  and your papers neatly filed.</p>
<p>F. Finish your poetry for publication. Finish the synthesis of the Tarot and 
  start work on the preparation of the lessons of class instruction from your 
  book.</p>
<p>G. Pay no attention to any phenomena whatsoever, and continue in a sober and 
  responsible way of life under all circumstances.</p>
<p>Not magical! For you nothing is more magical. Only thus can the curse of Saturn 
  be overcome. I see you hate this way. But it is an ultimate time--it is you 
  that have taken the oath. The choice is me or Choronzon.</p>
<p>I await you in the City of the Pyramids.</p>
