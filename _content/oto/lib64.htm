<p>0. The Temple being in darkness, and the Speaker ascended into his place let 
  him begin by a ritual of the Enterer, as followeth. </p>
<ol>
  <li>HB:Vau Priocul, O procul este profani. </li>
  <li>Bahlasti! Ompehda! </li>
  <li>In the name of the Mighty and Terrible One, I proclaim that I have banished 
    the Shells unto their habitations. </li>
  <li>I invoke Tahuti, the Lord of Wisdom and of Utterance, the God that cometh 
    forth from the Veil. </li>
  <li>O Thou! Majesty of Godhead! Wisdom-crowned Tahuti! Lord of the Gates of 
    the Universe! Thee, Thee, I invoke. <br>
    O Thou of the Ibis Head! Thee, Thee I invoke. <br>
    Thou who wieldest the Wand of Double Power! Thee, Thee I invoke! <br>
    Thou who bearest in Thy left hand the Rose and Cross of Light and Life: Thee, 
    Thee, I invoke. <br>
    Thou, whose head is as an emerald, and Thy nemmes as the night-sky blue! Thee, 
    Thee I invoke. <br>
    Thou, whose skin is of flaming orange as though it burned in a furnace! Thee, 
    Thee I invoke. </li>
  <li>Behold! I am Yesterday, To-Day, and the Brother of To-Morrow! <br>
    I am born again and and again. <br>
    Mine is the Unseen Force, whereof the Gods are sprung! Which is as Life unto 
    the Dwellers in the Watch-Towers of the Universe. <br>
    I am the Charioteer of the East, Lord of the Past and of the Future. <br>
    I see by mine own inward light: Lord of Resurrection; Who cometh forth from 
    the Dusk, and my birth is from the House of Death. </li>
  <li>O ye two Divine Hawks upon your Pinnacles! <br>
    Who keep watch over the Universe! <br>
    Ye who company the Bier to the House of Rest! <br>
    Who pilot the Ship of Ra advancing onwards to the heights of heaven! <br>
    Lord of the Shrine which standeth in the Centre of the Earth! </li>
  <li>Behold, He is in me, and I in Him! <br>
    Mine is the Radiance, wherein Ptah floatheth over the firmament! <br>
    I travel upon high! <br>
    I tread upon the firmament of Nu! <br>
    I raise a flashing flame, with the lightning of Mine Eye! <br>
    Ever rushing on, in the splendour of the daily glorified Ra: giving my life 
    to the Dwellers of Earth. </li>
  <li>If I say &quot;Come up upon the mountains!&quot; the Celestial Waters shall 
    flow at my Word.<br>
    For I am Ra incarnate! <br>
    Kephra created in the Flesh! <br>
    I am the Eidolon of my father Tmu, Lord of the City of the Sun! </li>
  <li>The God who commands is in my mouth! <br>
    The God of Wisdom is in my Heart! <br>
    My tongue is the Sanctuary of Truth! <br>
    And a God sitteth upon my lips. </li>
  <li>My Word is accomplished every day! <br>
    And the desire of my heart realises itself, as that of Ptah when He createth! 
    <br>
    I am Eternal; therefore all things are as my designs; therefore do all things 
    obey my Word. </li>
  <li>Therefore do Thou come forth unto me from Thine abode in the Silence: Unutterable 
    Wisdom! All-Light! All-Power! <br>
    Thoth! Hermes! Mercury! Odin! <br>
    By whatever name I call Thee, Thou art still nameless to Eternity:. Come Thou 
    forth, I say, and aid and guard me in this work of Art. </li>
  <li>Thou, Star of the East, that didst conduct the Magi! <br>
    Thou art The Same all-present in Heaven and in Hell! <br>
    Thou that vibratest between the Light and the Darkness! <br>
    Rising, descending! Changing ever, yet ever The Same! <br>
    The Sun is Thy Father! <br>
    Thy Mother is the Moon! <br>
    The Wind hath borne Thee in its bosom: and Earth hath ever nourished the changeless 
    Godhead of Thy Youth! </li>
  <li>Come Thou forth, I say, come Thou forth! <br>
    And make all Spirits subject unto Me: <br>
    So that every Spirit of the Firmament <br>
    And of the Ether. <br>
    And of the Earth. <br>
    And under the Earth. <br>
    On dry land <br>
    And in the Water. <br>
    Of whirling Air <br>
    And of rushing Fire. <br>
    And every Spell and Scourge of God the Vast One, may be obedient unto Me! 
  </li>
  <li>I invoke the priestess of the Silver Star, Asi the Curved One, by the ritual 
    of Silence. </li>
  <li>I make open the gate of Bliss; I descend from the Palace of the Stars; I 
    greet you, I embrace you, O children of Earth, that are gathered together 
    in the Hall of Darkness. </li>
  <li>(A pause.) </li>
  <li>The Speech in the Silence. <br>
    The Words against the Son of Night. <br>
    The Voice of Tahuti in the Universe in the Presence of the Eternal. <br>
    The Formulas of Knowledge. <br>
    The Wisdom of Breath. <br>
    The Root of Vibration. <br>
    The Shaking of the Invisible. <br>
    The Rolling Asunder of the Darkness. <br>
    The Becoming Visible of Matter.<br>
    The Piercing of the Scales of the Crocodile. <br>
    The Breaking Forth of the Light! </li>
  <li>(Follows the Lection.) </li>
  <li>There is an end of the speech; let the Silence of darkness be broken; let 
    it return into the silence of light. </li>
  <li>The speaker silently departs; the listeners disperse unto their homes; yea, 
    they disperse unto their homes.</li>
