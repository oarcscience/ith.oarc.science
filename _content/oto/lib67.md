## Liber 67

> > I flung out of chapel and church  
> > Temple and hall an meeting-room  
> > Venus' Bower and Osiris' Tomb,  
> > and left the devil in the lurch,  
> > While God got lost in the crowd of gods,  
> > And soul went down in the turbid tide  
> > Of the metaphysical Lotus-eyed,  
> > And I was -- anyhow, what's the odds?  
> > \[...\]  
> > Yet by-and-by I hope to weave  
> > A song of Anti-Christmas Eve  
> > And First- and Second-Beast-er Day.  
> > There's one who loves me dearly (vrai!)  
> > Who yet believes me sprung from Tophet,  
> > Either the Beast or the False Prophet;  
> > And by all sorts of monkey tricks  
> > Adds up my name to Six Six Six.  
> > Retire, good Gallup! In such strife her  
> > Superior skill makes *you* a cipher!  
> > Ho! I adopt the number. Look  
> > At the quaint wrapper of this book!  
> > I will deserve it if I can: It is the number of a Man.

> > So great a fool that I disclaim  
> > Indeed Jehovah's hate for shame  
> > That man to-day should not be weaned  
> > Of worshipping so foul a fiend  
> > In presence of the living Sun,  
> > And yet replace him oiled and clean  
> > By the Egyptian Pantheon,  
> > The same thing by another name.  
> > Thus when of late Egyptian Gods  
> > Evoked ecstatic periods  
> > In verse of mine, you thought I praised  
> > Or worshipped them -- I stand amazed.  
> > I merely wished to chant in verse  
> > Some aspects of the Universe,  
> > Summed up these subtle forces finely,  
> > And sang of them (I think divinely)  
> > In name and form; a fault perhaps --  
> > Reviewers are such funny chaps!  
> > I think that ordinary folk,  
> > Though, understood the things I spoke.  
> > For Gods, and devils too, I find  
> > Are merely modes of my own mind!
