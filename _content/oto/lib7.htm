<ol>
  <li>Into my loneliness comes - 
  <li>The sound of a flute in dim groves that haunt the uttermost hills. 
  <li>Even from the brave river they reach to the edge of the wilderness. 
  <li>And I behold Pan. 
  <li>The snows are eternal above, above - 
  <li>And their perfume smokes upward into the nostrils of the stars. 
  <li>But what have I to do with these? 
  <li>To me only the distant flute, the abiding vision of Pan. 
  <li>On all sides Pan to the eye, to the ear; 
  <li>The perfume of Pan pervading, the taste of him utterly filling my mouth, 
    so that the tongue breaks forth into a weird and monstrous speech. 
  <li>The embrace of him intense on every centre of pain and pleasure. 
  <li>The sixth interior sense aflame with the inmost self of Him, 
  <li>Myself flung down the precipice of being 
  <li>Even to the abyss, annihilation. 
  <li>An end to loneliness, as to all. 
  <li>Pan! Pan! Io Pan! Io Pan! 
</ol>
<p align="center" class="heading">I</p>
<ol>
  <li>My God, how I love Thee! 
  <li>With the vehement appetite of a beast I hunt Thee through the Universe. 
  <li>Thou art standing as it were upon a pinnacle at the edge of some fortified 
    city. I am a white bird, and perch upon Thee. 
  <li>Thou art My Lover: I see Thee as a nymph with her white limbs stretched 
    by the spring. 
  <li>She lies upon the moss; there is none other but she: 
  <li>Art Thou not Pan? 
  <li>I am He. Speak not, O my God! Let the work be accomplished in silence. 
  <li>Let my cry of pain be crystallized into a little white fawn to run away 
    into the forest! 
  <li>Thou art a centaur, O my God, from the violet-blossoms that crown Thee to 
    the hoofs of the horse. 
  <li>Thou art harder than tempered steel; there is no diamond beside Thee. 
  <li>Did I not yield this body and soul? 
  <li>I woo thee with a dagger drawn across my throat. 
  <li>Let the spout of blood quench Thy blood-thirst, O my God! 
  <li>Thou art a little white rabbit in the burrow Night. 
  <li>I am greater than the fox and the hole. 
  <li>Give me Thy kisses, O Lord God! 
  <li>The lightning came and licked up the little flock of sheep. 
  <li>There is a tongue and a flame; I see that trident walking over the sea. 
  <li>A phoenix hath it for its head; below are two prongs. They spear the wicked. 
  <li>I will spear Thee, O Thou little grey god, unless Thou beware! 
  <li>From the grey to the gold; from the gold to that which is beyond the gold 
    of Ophir. 
  <li>My God! but I love Thee! 
  <li>Why hast Thou whispered so ambiguous things? Wast Thou afraid, O goat-hoofed 
    One, O horned One, O pillar of lightning? 
  <li>From the lightning fall pearls; from the pearls black specks of nothing. 
  <li>I based all on one, one on naught. 
  <li>Afloat in the aether, O my God, my God! 
  <li>O Thou great hooded sun of glory, cut off these eyelids! 
  <li>Nature shall die out; she hideth me, closing mine eyelids with fear, she 
    hideth me from My destruction, O Thou open eye. 
  <li>O ever-weeping One! 
  <li>Not Isis my mother, nor Osiris my self; but the incestuous Horus given over 
    to Typhon, so may I be! 
  <li>There thought; and thought is evil. 
  <li>Pan! Pan! Io Pan! it is enough. 
  <li>Fall not into death, O my soul! Think that death is the bed into which you 
    are falling! 
  <li>O how I love Thee, O my God! Especially is there a vehement parallel light 
    from infinity, vilely diffracted in the haze of this mind. 
  <li>I love Thee. I love Thee. I love Thee. 
  <li>Thou art a beautiful thing whiter than a woman in the column of this vibration. 
  <li>I shoot up vertically like an arrow, and become that Above. 
  <li>But it is death, and the flame of the pyre. 
  <li>Ascend in the flame of the pyre, O my soul! Thy God is like the cold emptiness 
    of the utmost heaven, into which thou radiatest thy little light. 
  <li>When Thou shall know me, O empty God, my flame shall utterly expire in Thy 
    great N. O. X. 
  <li>What shalt Thou be, my God, when I have ceased to love Thee? 
  <li>A worm, a nothing, a niddering knave! 
  <li>But Oh! I love Thee. 
  <li>I have thrown a million flowers from the basket of the Beyond at Thy feet, 
    I have anointed Thee and Thy Staff with oil and blood and kisses. 
  <li>I have kindled Thy marble into life - ay! into death. 
  <li>I have been smitten with the reek of Thy mouth, that drinketh never wine 
    but life. 
  <li>How the dew of the Universe whitens the lips! 
  <li>Ah! trickling flow of the stars of the mother Supernal, begone! 
  <li>I Am She that should come, the Virgin of all men. 
  <li>I am a boy before Thee, O Thou satyr God. 
  <li>Thou wilt inflict the punishment of pleasure - Now! Now! Now! 
  <li>Io Pan! Io Pan! I love Thee. I love Thee. 
  <li>O my God, spare me! 
  <li>Now! It is done! Death. 
  <li>I cried aloud the word - and it was a mighty spell to bind the Invisible, 
    an enchantment to unbind the bound; yea, to unbind the bound. 
</ol>
<p align="center" class="heading">II</p>
<ol>
  <li>O my God! use Thou me again, alway. For ever! For ever! 
  <li>That which came fire from Thee cometh water from me; let therefore Thy Spirit 
    lay hold on me, so that my right hand loose the lightning. 
  <li>Travelling through space, I saw the onrush of two galaxies, butting each 
    other and goring like bulls upon earth. I was afraid. 
  <li>Thus they ceased fight, and turned upon me, and I was sorely crushed and 
    torn. 
  <li>I had rather have been trampled by the World-Elephant. 
  <li>O my God! Thou art my little pet tortoise! 
  <li>Yet Thou sustainest the World-Elephant. 
  <li>I creep under Thy carapace, like a lover into the bed of his beautiful; 
    I creep in, and sit in Thine heart, as cubby and cosy as may be. 
  <li>Thou shelterest me, that I hear not the trumpeting of that World-Elephant. 
  <li>Thou art not worth an obol in the agora; yet Thou art not to be bought at 
    the ransom of the whole Universe. 
  <li>Thou art like a beautiful Nubian slave leaning her naked purple against 
    the green pillars of marble that are above the bath. 
  <li>Wine jets from her black nipples. 
  <li>I drank wine awhile agone in the house of Pertinax. The cup-boy favoured 
    me, and gave me of the right sweet Chian. 
  <li>There was a Doric boy, skilled in feats of strength, an athlete. The full 
    moon fled away angrily down the wrack. Ah! but we laughed. 
  <li>I was pernicious drunk, O my God! Yet Pertinax brought me to the bridal. 
  <li>I had a crown of thorns for all my dower. 
  <li>Thou art like a goat's horn from Astor, O Thou God of mine, gnarl'd and 
    crook'd and devilish strong. 
  <li>Colder than all the ice of all the glaciers of the Naked Mountain was the 
    wine it poured for me. 
  <li>A wild country and a waning moon Clouds scudding over the sky. A circuit 
    of pines, and of tall yews beyond. Thou in the midst! 
  <li>O all ye toads and cats, rejoice! Ye slimy things, come hither! 
  <li>Dance, dance to the Lord our God! 
  <li>He is he! He is he! He is he! 
  <li>Why should I go on? 
  <li>Why? Why? comes the sudden cackle of a million imps of hell. 
  <li>And the laughter runs. 
  <li>But sickens not the Universe; but shakes not the stars. 
  <li>God! how I love Thee! 
  <li>I am walking in an asylum; all the men and women about me are insane. 
  <li>Oh madness! madness! madness! desirable art thou! 
  <li>But I love Thee, O God! 
  <li>These men and women rave and howl; they froth out folly. 
  <li>I begin to be afraid. I have no check; I am alone. Alone. Alone. 
  <li>Think, O God, how I am happy in Thy love. 
  <li>O marble Pan! O false leering face! I love Thy dark kisses, bloody and stinking! 
    O marble Pan! Thy kisses are like sunlight on the blue Aegean; their blood 
    is the blood of the sunset over Athens; their stink is like a garden of Roses 
    of Macedonia. 
  <li>I dreamt of sunset and roses and vines; Thou wast there, O my God, Thou 
    didst habit Thyself as an Athenian courtesan, and I loved Thee. 
  <li>Thou art no dream, O Thou too beautiful alike for sleep and waking! 
  <li>I disperse the insane folk of the earth; I walk alone with my little puppets 
    in the garden. 
  <li>I am Gargantuan great; yon galaxy is but the smoke-ring of mine incense. 
  <li>Burn Thou strange herbs, O God! 
  <li>Brew me a magic liquor, boys, with your glances! 
  <li>The very soul is drunken. 
  <li>Thou art drunken, O my God, upon my kisses. 
  <li>The Universe reels; Thou hast looked upon it. 
  <li>Twice, and all is done. 
  <li>Come, O my God, and let us embrace! 
  <li>Lazily, hungrily, ardently, patiently; so will I work. 
  <li>There shall be an End. 
  <li>O God! O God! 
  <li>I am a fool to love Thee; Thou art cruel, Thou withholdest Thyself. 
  <li>Come to me now! I love Thee! I love Thee! 
  <li>O my darling, my darling - Kiss me! Kiss me! Ah! but again. 
  <li>Sleep, take me! Death, take me! This life is too full; it pains, it slays, 
    it suffices. 
  <li>Let me go back into the world; yea, back into the world. 
</ol>
<p align="center" class="heading">III</p>
<ol>
  <li>I was the priest of Ammon-Ra in the temple of Ammon-Ra at Thebai. 
  <li>But Bacchus came singing with his troops of vine-clad girls, of girls in 
    dark mantles; and Bacchus in the midst like a fawn! 
  <li>God! how I ran out in my rage and scattered the chorus! 
  <li>But in my temple stood Bacchus as the priest of Ammon-Ra. 
  <li>Therefore I went wildly with the girls into Abyssinia; and there we abode 
    and rejoiced. 
  <li>Exceedingly; yea, in good sooth! 
  <li>I will eat the ripe and the unripe fruit for the glory of Bacchus. 
  <li>Terraces of ilex, and tiers of onyx and opal and sardonyx leading up to 
    the cool green porch of malachite. 
  <li>Within is a crystal shell, shaped like an oyster - O glory of Priapus! O 
    beatitude of the Great Goddess! 
  <li>Therein is a pearl. 
  <li>O Pearl! thou hast come from the majesty of dread Ammon-Ra. 
  <li>Then I the priest beheld a steady glitter in the heart of the pearl. 
  <li>So bright we could not look! But behold! a blood-red rose upon a rood of 
    glowing gold! 
  <li>So I adored the God. Bacchus! thou art the lover of my God! 
  <li>I who was priest of Ammon-Ra, who saw the Nile flow by for many moons, for 
    many, many moons, am the young fawn of the grey land. 
  <li>I will set up my dance in your conventicles, and my secret loves shall be 
    sweet among you. 
  <li>Thou shalt have a lover among the lords of the grey land. 
  <li>This shall he bring unto thee, without which all is in vain; a man's life 
    spilt for thy love upon My Altars. 
  <li>Amen. 
  <li>Let it be soon, O God, my God! I ache for Thee, I wander very lonely among 
    the mad folk, in the grey land of desolation. 
  <li>Thou shalt set up the abominable lonely Thing of wickedness. Oh joy! to 
    lay that corner-stone! 
  <li>It shall stand erect upon the high mountain; only my God shall commune with 
    it. 
  <li>I will build it of a single ruby; it shall be seen from afar off. 
  <li>Come! let us irritate the vessels of the earth: they shall distil strange 
    wine. 
  <li>It grows under my hand: it shall cover the whole heaven. 
  <li>Thou art behind me: I scream with a mad joy. 
  <li>Then said Ithuriel the strong; let Us also worship this invisible marvel! 
  <li>So did they, and the archangels swept over the heaven. 
  <li>Strange and mystic, like a yellow priest invoking mighty flights of great 
    grey birds from the North, so do I stand and invoke Thee! 
  <li>Let them obscure not the sun with their wings and their clamour! 
  <li>Take away form and its following! 
  <li>I am still. 
  <li>Thou art like an osprey among the rice, I am the great red pelican in the 
    sunset waters. 
  <li>I am like a black eunuch; and Thou art the scimitar. I smite off the head 
    of the light one, the breaker of bread and salt. 
  <li>Yea! I smite - and the blood makes as it were a sunset on the lapis lazuli 
    of the King's Bedchamber. 
  <li>I smite! The whole world is broken up into a mighty wind, and a voice cries 
    aloud in a tongue that men cannot speak. 
  <li>I know that awful sound of primal joy; let us follow on the wings of the 
    gale even unto the holy house of Hathor; let us offer the five jewels of the 
    cow upon her altar! 
  <li>Again the inhuman voice! 
  <li>I rear my Titan bulk into the teeth of the gale, and I smite and prevail, 
    and swing me out over the sea. 
  <li>There is a strange pale God, a god of pain and deadly wickedness. 
  <li>My own soul bites into itself, like a scorpion ringed with fire. 
  <li>That pallid God with face averted, that God of subtlety and laughter, that 
    young Doric God, him will I serve. 
  <li>For the end thereof is torment unspeakable. 
  <li>Better the loneliness of the great grey sea! 
  <li>But ill befall the folk of the grey land, my God! 
  <li>Let me smother them with my roses! 
  <li>Oh Thou delicious God, smile sinister! 
  <li>I pluck Thee, O my God, like a purple plum upon a sunny tree. How Thou dost 
    melt in my mouth, Thou consecrated sugar of the Stars! 
  <li>The world is all grey before mine eyes; it is like an old worn wine-skin. 
  <li>All the wine of it is on these lips. 
  <li>Thou hast begotten me upon a marble Statue, O my God! 
  <li>The body is icy cold with the coldness of a million moons; it is harder 
    than the adamant of eternity. How shall I come forth into the light? 
  <li>Thou art He, O God! O my darling! my child! my plaything! Thou art like 
    a cluster of maidens, like a multitude of swans upon the lake. 
  <li>I feel the essence of softness. 
  <li>I am hard and strong and male; but come Thou! I shall be soft and weak and 
    feminine. 
  <li>Thou shalt crush me in the wine-press of Thy love. My blood shall stain 
    Thy fiery feet with litanies of Love in Anguish. 
  <li>There shall be a new flower in the fields, a new vintage in the vineyards. 
  <li>The bees shall gather a new honey; the poets shall sing a new song. 
  <li>I shall gain the Pain of the Goat for my prize; and the God that sitteth 
    upon the shoulders of Time shall drowse. 
  <li>Then shall all this which is written be accomplished: yea, it shall be accomplished. 
</ol>
<p align="center" class="heading">IV</p>
<ol>
  <li>I am like a maiden bathing in a clear pool of fresh water. 
  <li>O my God! I see Thee dark and desirable, rising through the water as a golden 
    smoke. 
  <li>Thou art altogether golden, the hair and the eyebrows and the brilliant 
    face; even into the finger-tips and toe-tips Thou art one rosy dream of gold. 
  <li>Deep into Thine eyes that are golden my soul leaps, like an archangel menacing 
    the sun. 
  <li>My sword passes through and through Thee; crystalline moons ooze out of 
    Thy beautiful body that is hidden behind the ovals of Thine eyes. 
  <li>Deeper, ever deeper. I fall, even as the whole Universe falls down the abyss 
    of Years. 
  <li>For Eternity calls; the Overworld calls; the world of the Word is awaiting 
    us. 
  <li>Be done with speech, O God! Fasten the fangs of the hound Eternity in this 
    my throat! 
  <li>I am like a wounded bird flapping in circles. 
  <li>Who knows where I shall fall? 
  <li>O blessed One! O God! O my devourer! 
  <li>Let me fall, fall down, fall away, afar, alone! 
  <li>Let me fall! 
  <li>Nor is there any rest, Sweet Heart, save in the cradle of royal Bacchus, 
    the thigh of the most Holy One. 
  <li>There rest, under the canopy of night. 
  <li>Uranus chid Eros; Marsyas chid Olympas; I chid my beautiful lover with his 
    sunray mane; shall I not sing? 
  <li>Shall not mine incantations bring around me the wonderful company of the 
    wood-gods, their bodies glistening with the ointment of moonlight and honey 
    and myrrh? 
  <li>Worshipful are ye, O my lovers; let us forward to the dimmest hollow! 
  <li>There we will feast upon mandrake and upon moly! 
  <li>There the lovely One shall spread us His holy banquet. In the brown cakes 
    of corn we shall taste the food of the world, and be strong. 
  <li>In the ruddy and awful cup of death we shall drink the blood of the world, 
    and be drunken! 
  <li>Ohe! the song to Iao, the song to Iao! 
  <li>Come, let us sing to thee, Iacchus invisible, Iacchus triumphant, Iacchus 
    indicible! 
  <li>Iacchus, O Iacchus, O Iacchus, be near us! 
  <li>Then was the countenance of all time darkened, and the true light shone 
    forth. 
  <li>There was also a certain cry in an unknown tongue, whose stridency troubled 
    the still waters of my soul, so that my mind and my body were healed of their 
    disease, self-knowledge. 
  <li>Yea, an angel troubled the waters. 
  <li>This was the cry of Him: IIIOOShBThIO-IIIIAMAMThIBI-II. 
  <li>Nor did I sing this for a thousand times a night for a thousand nights before 
    Thou camest, O my flaming God, and pierced me with Thy spear. Thy scarlet 
    robe unfolded the whole heavens, so that the Gods said: All is burning: it 
    is the end. 
  <li>Also Thou didst set Thy lips to the wound and suck out a million eggs. And 
    Thy mother sat upon them, and lo! stars and stars and ultimate Things whereof 
    stars are the atoms. 
  <li>Then I perceived Thee, O my God, sitting like a white cat upon the trellis-work 
    of the arbour; and the hum of the spinning worlds was but Thy pleasure. 
  <li>O white cat, the sparks fly from Thy fur! Thou dost crackle with splitting 
    the worlds. 
  <li>I have seen more of Thee in the white cat than I saw in the Vision of Aeons. 
  <li>In the boat of Ra did I travel, but I never found upon the visible Universe 
    any being like unto Thee! 
  <li>Thou wast like a winged white horse, and I raced Thee through eternity against 
    the Lord of the Gods. 
  <li>So still we race! 
  <li>Thou wast like a flake of snow falling in the pine-clad woods. 
  <li>In a moment Thou wast lost in a wilderness of the like and the unlike. 
  <li>But I beheld the beautiful God at the back of the blizzard - and Thou wast 
    He! 
  <li>Also I read in a great book. 
  <li>On ancient skin was written in letters of gold: Verbum fit Verbum. 
  <li>Also Vitriol and the hierophant's name V.V.V.V.V. 
  <li>All this wheeled in fire, in star-fire, rare and far and utterly lonely 
    - even as Thou and I, O desolate soul my God! 
  <li>Yea, and the writing<br>
    <img SRC="images/liber7.gif" ALT="Two rows of cryptic glyphs, sixteen in total." WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="138"> 
    It is well.<br>
    This is the voice which shook the earth. 
  <li>Eight times he cried aloud, and by eight and by eight shall I count Thy 
    favours, Oh Thou Elevenfold God 418! 
  <li>Yea, and by many more; by the ten in the twenty-two directions; even as 
    the perpendicular of the Pyramid - so shall Thy favours be. 
  <li>If I number them, they are One. 
  <li>Excellent is Thy love, Oh Lord! Thou art revealed by the darkness, and he 
    who gropeth in the horror of the groves shall haply catch Thee, even as a 
    snake that seizeth on a little singing-bird. 
  <li>I have caught Thee, O my soft thrush; I am like a hawk of mother-of-emerald; 
    I catch Thee by instinct, though my eyes fail from Thy glory. 
  <li>Yet they are but foolish folk yonder. I see them on the yellow sand, all 
    clad in Tyrian purple. 
  <li>They draw their shining God unto the land in nets; they build a fire to 
    the Lord of Fire, and cry unhallowed words, even the dreadful curse Amri maratza, 
    maratza, atman deona lastadza maratza maritza - maran! 
  <li>Then do they cook the shining god, and gulp him whole. 
  <li>These are evil folk, O beautiful boy! let us pass on to the Otherworld. 
  <li>Let us make ourselves into a pleasant bait, into a seductive shape! 
  <li>I will be like a splendid naked woman with ivory breasts and golden nipples; 
    my whole body shall be like the milk of the stars. I will be lustrous and 
    Greek, a courtesan of Delos, of the unstable Isle. 
  <li>Thou shalt be like a little red worm on a hook. 
  <li>But thou and I will catch our fish alike. 
  <li>Then wilt thou be a shining fish with golden back and silver belly: I will 
    be like a violent beautiful man, stronger than two score bulls, a man of the 
    West bearing a great sack of precious jewels upon a staff that is greater 
    than the axis of the all. 
  <li>And the fish shall be sacrificed to Thee and the strong man crucified for 
    Me, and Thou and I will kiss, and atone for the wrong of the Beginning; yea, 
    for the wrong of the beginning. 
</ol>
<p align="center" class="heading">V</p>
<ol>
  <li>O my beautiful God! I swim in Thy heart like a trout in the mountain torrent. 
  <li>I leap from pool to pool in my joy; I am goodly with brown and gold and 
    silver. 
  <li>Why, I am lovelier than the russet autumn woods at the first snowfall. 
  <li>And the crystal cave of my thought is lovelier than I. 
  <li>Only one fish-hook can draw me out; it is a woman kneeling by the bank of 
    the stream. It is she that pours the bright dew over herself, and into the 
    sand so that the river gushes forth. 
  <li>There is a bird on yonder myrtle; only the song of that bird can draw me 
    out of the pool of Thy heart, O my God! 
  <li>Who is this Neapolitan boy that laughs in his happiness? His lover is the 
    mighty crater of the Mountain of Fire. I saw his charred limbs borne down 
    the slopes in a stealthy tongue of liquid stone. 
  <li>And Oh! the chirp of the cicada! 
  <li>I remember the days when I was cacique in Mexico. 
  <li>O my God, wast Thou then as now my beautiful lover? 
  <li>Was my boyhood then as now Thy toy, Thy joy? 
  <li>Verily, I remember those iron days. 
  <li>I remember how we drenched the bitter lakes with our torrent of gold; how 
    we sank the treasurable image in the crater of Citlaltepetl. 
  <li>How the good flame lifted us even unto the lowlands, setting us down in 
    the impenetrable forest. 
  <li>Yea, Thou wast a strange scarlet bird with a bill of gold. I was Thy mate 
    in the forests of the lowland; and ever we heard from afar the shrill chant 
    of mutilated priests and the insane clamour of the Sacrifice of Maidens. 
  <li>There was a weird winged God that told us of his wisdom. 
  <li>We attained to be starry grains of gold dust in the sands of a slow river. 
  <li>Yea, and that river was the river of space and time also. 
  <li>We parted thence; ever to the smaller, ever to the greater, until now, O 
    sweet God, we are ourselves, the same. 
  <li>O God of mine, Thou art like a little white goat with lightning in his horns! 
  <li>I love Thee, I love Thee. 
  <li>Every breath, every word, every thought, every deed is an act of love with 
    Thee. 
  <li>The beat of my heart is the pendulum of love. 
  <li>The songs of me are the soft sighs: 
  <li>The thoughts of me are very rapture: 
  <li>And my deeds are the myriads of Thy children, the stars and the atoms. 
  <li>Let there be nothing! 
  <li>Let all things drop into this ocean of love! 
  <li>Be this devotion a potent spell to exorcise the demons of the Five! 
  <li>Ah God, all is gone! Thou dost consummate Thy rapture. Falutli! Falutli! 
  <li>There is a solemnity of the silence. There is no more voice at all. 
  <li>So shall it be unto the end. We who were dust shall never fall away into 
    the dust. 
  <li>So shall it be. 
  <li>Then, O my God, the breath of the Garden of Spices. All these have a savour 
    averse. 
  <li>The cone is cut with an infinite ray; the curve of hyperbolic life springs 
    into being. 
  <li>Farther and farther we float; yet we are still. It is the chain of systems 
    that is falling away from us. 
  <li>First falls the silly world; the world of the old grey land. 
  <li>Falls it unthinkably far, with its sorrowful bearded face presiding over 
    it; it fades to silence and woe. 
  <li>We to silence and bliss, and the face is the laughing face of Eros. 
  <li>Smiling we greet him with the secret signs. 
  <li>He leads us into the Inverted Palace. 
  <li>There is the Heart of Blood, a pyramid reaching its apex down beyond the 
    Wrong of the Beginning. 
  <li>Bury me unto Thy Glory, O beloved, O princely lover of this harlot maiden, 
    within the Secretest Chamber of the Palace! 
  <li>It is done quickly; yea, the seal is set upon the vault. 
  <li>There is one that shall avail to open it. 
  <li>Nor by memory, nor by imagination, nor by prayer, nor by fasting, nor by 
    scourging, nor by drugs, nor by ritual, nor by meditation; only by passive 
    love shall he avail. 
  <li>He shall await the sword of the Beloved and bare his throat for the stroke. 
  <li>Then shall his blood leap out and write me runes in the sky; yea, write 
    me runes in the sky.

  <li>Thou wast a priestess, O my God, among the Druids; and we knew the powers 
    of the oak. 
  <li>We made us a temple of stones in the shape of the Universe, even as thou 
    didst wear openly and I concealed. 
  <li>There we performed many wonderful things by midnight. 
  <li>By the waning moon did we work. 
  <li>Over the plain came the atrocious cry of wolves. 
  <li>We answered; we hunted with the pack. 
  <li>We came even unto the new Chapel and Thou didst bear away the Holy Graal 
    beneath Thy Druid vestments. 
  <li>Secretly and by stealth did we drink of the informing sacrament. 
  <li>Then a terrible disease seized upon the folk of the grey land; and we rejoiced. 
  <li>O my God, disguise Thy glory! 
  <li>Come as a thief, and let us steal away the Sacraments! 
  <li>In our groves, in our cloistral cells, in our honeycomb of happiness, let 
    us drink, let us drink! 
  <li>It is the wine that tinges everything with the true tincture of infallible 
    gold. 
  <li>There are deep secrets in these songs. It is not enough to hear the bird; 
    to enjoy song he must be the bird. 
  <li>I am the bird, and Thou art my song, O my glorious galloping God! 
  <li>Thou reinest in the stars; thou drivest the constellations seven abreast 
    through the circus of Nothingness. 
  <li>Thou Gladiator God! 
  <li>I play upon mine harp; Thou fightest the beasts and the flames. 
  <li>Thou takest Thy joy in the music, and I in the fighting. 
  <li>Thou and I are beloved of the Emperor. 
  <li>See! he has summoned us to the Imperial dais. The night falls; it is a great 
    orgy of worship and bliss. 
  <li>The night falls like a spangled cloak from the shoulders of a prince upon 
    a slave. 
  <li>He rises a free man! 
  <li>Cast thou, O prophet, the cloak upon these slaves! 
  <li>A great night, and scarce fires therein; but freedom for the slave that 
    its glory shall encompass. 
  <li>So also I went down into the great sad city. 
  <li>There dead Messalina bartered her crown for poison from the dead Locusta; 
    there stood Caligula, and smote the seas of forgetfulness. 
  <li>Who wast Thou, O Caesar, that Thou knewest God in an horse? 
  <li>For lo! we beheld the White Horse of the Saxon engraven upon the earth; 
    and we beheld the Horses of the Sea that flame about the old grey land, and 
    the foam from their nostrils enlightens us! 
  <li>Ah! but I love thee, God! 
  <li>Thou art like a moon upon the ice-world. 
  <li>Thou art like the dawn of the utmost snows upon the burnt-up flats of the 
    tiger's land. 
  <li>By silence and by speech do I worship Thee. 
  <li>But all is in vain. 
  <li>Only Thy silence and Thy speech that worship me avail. 
  <li>Wail, O ye folk of the grey land, for we have drunk your wine, and left 
    ye but the bitter dregs. 
  <li>Yet from these we will distil ye a liquor beyond the nectar of the Gods. 
  <li>There is value in our tincture for a world of Spice and gold. 
  <li>For our red powder of projection is beyond all possibilities. 
  <li>There are few men; there are enough. 
  <li>We shall be full of cup-bearers, and the wine is not stinted. 
  <li>O dear my God! what a feast Thou hast provided. 
  <li>Behold the lights and the flowers and the maidens! 
  <li>Taste of the wines and the cakes and the splendid meats! 
  <li>Breathe in the perfumes and the clouds of little gods like wood-nymphs that 
    inhabit the nostrils! 
  <li>Feel with your whole body the glorious smoothness of the marble coolth and 
    the generous warmth of the sun and the slaves! 
  <li>Let the Invisible inform all the devouring Light of its disruptive vigour! 
  <li>Yea! all the world is split apart, as an old grey tree by the lightning! 
  <li>Come, O ye gods, and let us feast. 
  <li>Thou, O my darling, O my ceaseless Sparrow-God, my delight, my desire, my 
    deceiver, come Thou and chirp at my right hand! 
  <li>This was the tale of the memory of Al A'in the priest; yea, of Al A'in the 
    priest. 
</ol>
<p align="center" class="heading">VII</p>
<ol>
  <li>By the burning of the incense was the Word revealed, and by the distant 
    drug. 
  <li>O meal and honey and oil! O beautiful flag of the moon, that she hangs out 
    in the centre of bliss! 
  <li>These loosen the swathings of the corpse; these unbind the feet of Osiris, 
    so that the flaming God may rage through the firmament with his fantastic 
    spear. 
  <li>But of pure black marble is the sorry statue, and the changeless pain of 
    the eyes is bitter to the blind. 
  <li>We understand the rapture of that shaken marble, torn by the throes of the 
    crowned child, the golden rod of the golden God. 
  <li>We know why all is hidden in the stone, within the coffin, within the mighty 
    sepulchre, and we too answer Olalam! Imal! Tutulu! as it is written in the 
    ancient book. 
  <li>Three words of that book are as life to a new aeon; no god has read the 
    whole. 
  <li>But thou and I, O God, have written it page by page. 
  <li>Ours is the elevenfold reading of the Elevenfold word. 
  <li>These seven letters together make seven diverse words; each word is divine, 
    and seven sentences are hidden therein. 
  <li>Thou art the Word, O my darling, my lord, my master! 
  <li>O come to me, mix the fire and the water, all shall dissolve. 
  <li>I await Thee in sleeping, in waking. I invoke Thee no more; for Thou art 
    in me, O Thou who hast made me a beautiful instrument tuned to Thy rapture. 
  <li>Yet art Thou ever apart, even as I. 
  <li>I remember a certain holy day in the dusk of the year, in the dusk of the 
    Equinox of Osiris, when first I beheld Thee visibly; when first the dreadful 
    issue was fought out; when the Ibis-headed One charmed away the strife. 
  <li>I remember Thy first kiss, even as a maiden should. Nor in the dark byways 
    was there another: Thy kisses abide. 
  <li>There is none other beside Thee in the whole Universe of Love. 
  <li>My God, I love Thee, O Thou goat with gilded horns! 
  <li>Thou beautiful bull of Apis! Thou beautiful serpent of Apep! Thou beautiful 
    child of the Pregnant Goddess! 
  <li>Thou hast stirred in Thy sleep, O ancient sorrow of years! Thou hast raised 
    Thine head to strike, and all is dissolved into the Abyss of Glory. 
  <li>An end to the letters of the words! An end to the sevenfold speech. 
  <li>Resolve me the wonder of it all into the figure of a gaunt swift camel striding 
    over the sand. 
  <li>Lonely is he, and abominable; yet hath he gained the crown. 
  <li>Oh rejoice! rejoice! 
  <li>My God! O my God! I am but a speck in the star-dust of ages; I am the Master 
    of the Secret of Things. 
  <li>I am the Revealer and the Preparer. Mine is the Sword - and the Mitre and 
    the Winged Wand! 
  <li>I am the Initiator and the Destroyer. Mine is the Globe - and the Bennu 
    bird and the Lotus of Isis my daughter! 
  <li>I am the One beyond these all; and I bear the symbols of the mighty darkness. 
  <li>There shall be a sigil as of a vast black brooding ocean of death and the 
    central blaze of darkness, radiating its night upon all. 
  <li>It shall swallow up that lesser darkness. 
  <li>But in that profound who shall answer: What is? 
  <li>Not I. 
  <li>Not Thou, O God! 
  <li>Come, let us no more reason together; let us enjoy! Let us be ourselves, 
    silent, unique, apart. 
  <li>O lonely woods of the world! In what recesses will ye hide our love? 
  <li>The forest of the spears of the Most High is called Night, and Hades, and 
    the Day of Wrath; but I am His captain, and I bear His cup. 
  <li>Fear me not with my spearmen! They shall slay the demons with their petty 
    prongs. Ye shall be free. 
  <li>Ah, slaves! ye will not - ye know not how to will. 
  <li>Yet the music of my spears shall be a song of freedom. 
  <li>A great bird shall sweep from the abyss of Joy, and bear ye away to be my 
    cup-bearers. 
  <li>Come, O my God, in one last rapture let us attain to the Union with the 
    Many! 
  <li>In the silence of Things, in the Night of Forces, beyond the accursed domain 
    of the Three, let us enjoy our love! 
  <li>My darling! My darling! away, away beyond the Assembly and the Law and the 
    Enlightenment unto an Anarchy of solitude and Darkness! 
  <li>For even thus must we veil the brilliance of our Self. 
  <li>My darling! My darling! 
  <li>O my God, but the love in Me bursts over the bonds of Space and Time; my 
    love is spilt among them that love not love. 
  <li>My wine is poured out for them that never tasted wine. 
  <li>The fumes thereof shall intoxicate them and the vigour of my love shall 
    breed mighty children from their maidens. 
  <li>Yea! without draught, without embrace: - and the Voice answered Yea! these 
    things shall be. 
  <li>Then I sought a Word for Myself; nay, for myself. 
  <li>And the Word came: O Thou! it is well. Heed naught! I love Thee! I love 
    Thee! 
  <li>Therefore had I faith unto the end of all; yea, unto the end of all.
