<h1 class="title" align="center">THE RITUAL OF PASSING THROUGH THE TUAT<br>
  Liber CXX</h1>
<h2 class="heading" align="center">A.'. A.'. Class D.</h2>
<p align="center">INTRODUCTION<br>
<p>This Rite, taken from materials in Crowley's Diary has the same numeration 
  as Liber CXX, SAMEKH.</p>
<p>In the matter of the directions, there are several markouts that make unclear 
  whether he intends to use the ordinary elemental directions: E. Air, S. Fire, 
  W. Water, N. Earth (as is implied in <a href="lib800">Liber Samekh</a>, 
  and used in the Lesser Pentagram, <a
        href="lib25">Star Ruby</a> and others) or if he intends the Directions 
  of the Cherubic Signs (as in the Planetary Stations): E. Fire, S. Earth, W. 
  Air, N. Water (used in the Lesser Hexagram, the <a href="lib36">Star Sapphire</a> 
  and others) or even the directions in <a
        href="lib5">Liber Reguli</a>: N. Air, S. Fire, E. Earth, W.Water.</p>
<p>The only set of directions that agree with the order of the Spell itself (ignoring 
  markouts on the directions) and go in order of the verse to be said, is that 
  of the Elemental Directions, which I have used.</p>
<p>There are a couple of other lacunae that I have not attempted to fill in, though 
  it is obvious what is intended. </p>
<p>Crowley sent this Ritual to Frater Semper Peratus as part of the material involved 
  in an Order called &quot;The Order of Thelemites&quot;.</p>
<p>In the Order of Thelemites (as also given in Liber AL vel Legis) there are 
  but three grades: the Hermit, the Lover, and the Man of Earth. In all official 
  documents of the Order (of Thelemites) they are referred to as Magister, Adeptus, 
  and Zelator.</p>
<p>The requirements to pass beyond the Grade of Zelator to the Grade of Adeptus 
  are that the candidate has completed the regular training of the Argentum Astrum 
  prior to the Grade of Adeptus.</p>
<p>The requirements for passage beyond the Grade of Adeptus to the Grade of Magister 
  are that the candidate be at least a Lord of the Paths of the Vault of the Adepts, 
  that eleven years as an Adeptus be completed, that the Grade of Babe of the 
  Abyss in the Argentum Astrum be completed, and that there be a retirement from 
  all active work in the Order involving contact with groups.</p>
<p>There were several other and more stringent requirements that also had to be 
  undergone according to the Constitution: pledge forms had to be signed and other 
  work completed.</p>
<p>Several papers were attached to this, which includes the opening and closing 
  of the Temple, as well as the Initiation Ritual for Zelator (which has to be 
  performed under four eyes).</p>
<p>These were:</p>
<p>Schedule A: Opening, Closing, Initiatiation Ritual of Zelators (this paper).</p>
<p>Schedule B: The Form of Initiation of Adepti (it is explicitly stated that 
  there shall be no Form of Initiation for Magisters).</p>
<p>Schedule C: Gives the Conditions by which Magisteri appoint Adepti to help 
  Zelators, and notes that the general plan of the O.T.O. is to be put before 
  all members of the Order ( of Thelemites).</p>
<p>Ritual CXX called &quot;of Passing through the Tuat&quot;. OPENING:</p>
<p>(Members assembled, clothed, throned)</p>
<p>Enter the Hierophant </p>
<p>(All rise and salute him.) The &quot;Ceremony of Recognition&quot; followeth. 
  But all, or one, shall show on entering the Temple The Mark of the Beast lest 
  the Guardian of the Temple be hasty with them.</p>
<p>All words and numbers affirmed, (crieth the Hierophant or Magus): </p>
<p>&quot;ABRAHADABRA. Hail unto thee, Heru-Ra-Ha, Ra-Hoor, ABRAHADABRA Lord of 
  the Day!</p>
<p>The Dark of the Sun is sunk in the waters of Amentet. Let there be a gathering 
  of the Lords of Silence!&quot;</p>
<p>111-11111-111</p>
<p>(He knocketh, He riseth, and giveth the 3 signs of...</p>
<p>Taking the weapon of which he means to work through out, or if he be assisted 
  by a child, the appropriate weapon be advanced to the center and crieth:</p>
<p>&quot;I am armed! I am armed! I am strong! I am strong!&quot;</p>
<p>(He goes to the West, where dwell the Undines.)</p>
<p>&quot;With my wand I drive back the dwellers of water&quot;</p>
<p>(To the South, where are Salamanders.)</p>
<p>&quot;Let the dwellers of Fire cower before the Fire of my Sword!&quot;</p>
<p>(In the East, the home of the Sylphs.)</p>
<p>&quot;Let the winds draw back at the waving of the spear!&quot;</p>
<p>(In the North, among the gnomes) </p>
<p>&quot;I have imprisoned the inhabitants of Earth. Let them keep silence before 
  me.&quot;</p>
<p>(Returns to center.)</p>
<p>&quot;I am armed! I am strong!</p>
<p>Let them bow, before the splendor of Ra-Hoor-Khuit!&quot;</p>
<p>(Next he performeth the 4 adorations as taught unto the outer world.)</p>
<p>&quot;I am the Lord of Thebes, and I<br>
  The inspired forth-speaker of Mentu;<br>
  For me unveils the veiled sky,<br>
  The self-slain Ankh-af-na-khonsu<br>
  Whose words are truth. I invoke, I greet<br>
  Thy presence, O Ra-Hoor-Khuit!</p>
<p>Unity uttermost showed!<br>
  I adore the might of Thy breath,<br>
  Supreme and terrible God,<br>
  Who makest the gods and death<br>
  To tremble before Thee:-<br>
  I, I adore thee!</p>
<p>Appear on the throne of Ra!<br>
  Open the ways of the Khu!<br>
  Lighten the ways of the Ka!<br>
  The ways of the Khabs run through<br>
  To stir me or still me!<br>
  Aum! let it fill me!</p>
<p>The light is mine; its rays consume<br>
  Me: I have made a secret door<br>
  Into the House of Ra and Tum,<br>
  Of Khephra and of Ahathoor.<br>
  I am thy Theban, O Mentu,<br>
  The prophet Ankh-af-na-khonsu!</p>
<p>By Bes-na-Maut my breast I beat;<br>
  By wise Ta-Nech I weave my spell.<br>
  Show thy star-splendour, O Nuit!<br>
  Bid me within thine House to dwell,<br>
  O winged snake of light, Hadit!<br>
  Abide with me, Ra-Hoor-Khuit!&quot;</p>
<p>(Followeth the mystical dance as taught in secret: or let the Magus trace 11 
  circles around the room, traveling against the course of the Sun, for that is 
  in effect He that is still, the Earth revolving.)</p>
<p>(Let the hymn be sung, or the Mantra recited. But ere he end, let him sing:)</p>
<p>&quot;Above, the gemmed azure is<br>
  The naked splendour of Nuit;<br>
  She bends in ecstasy to kiss<br>
  The secret ardours of Hadit.<br>
  The winged globe, the starry blue,<br>
  Are mine, O Ankh-af-na-khonsu!&quot;</p>
<p>(Then he cometh to the East of the Throne of Ra and crieth:)</p>
<p>&quot;Unity uttermost showed!<br>
  I adore the might of Thy breath,<br>
  Supreme and terrible God,<br>
  Who makest the gods and death<br>
  To tremble before Thee:-<br>
  I - I adore thee!&quot;</p>
<p>(Prostrating himself to the W. Then he resumes his Throne, assuming the Might 
  of the God &amp; saith:)</p>
<p>&quot;The light is mine; its rays consume<br>
  Me: I have made a secret door<br>
  Into the House of Ra and Tum,<br>
  Of Khephra and of Ahathoor.<br>
  I am thy Theban, O Mentu,<br>
  The prophet Ankh-af-na-khonsu!&quot;</p>
<p>(Silence: then:)</p>
<p>&quot;ABRAHADABRA 111 - 11111 - 111 (He knocketh.)</p>
<p><strong>CLOSING:</strong></p>
<p>&quot;ABRAHADABRA!</p>
<p>Hail unto thee, that art Ra in thy Rising! The Disk of Khephra standeth upon 
  the waters of Amentet: It is the Hour of the Dispersal of the Lords of Silence.&quot;</p>
<p>111 - 11111 - 111 (He knocketh)</p>
<p>(Rising, he doeth the ceremony, precisely as in the opening unto the 2nd verse 
  of the song called the spell. But he goeth with the Sun, as allowing Nature 
  to resume her sway. At the E. of the Throne of Ra he standeth and crieth:)</p>
<p>&quot;It is the Hour of the Feast of Ra-Hoor-Khuit.&quot;</p>
<p>(Lifting up the cakes of the Holy one of Light, the priest shall recite:)</p>
<p>&quot;I fly like an hawk! I perch upon that abode of the Aat on the festival 
  of the Mighty one of light. Let us live upon that which the Gods give us, &amp; 
  the Khus; let us live and get power by these cakes; let us eat them before the 
  gods and the Khus; let us get power by these cakes! Let us eat thereof under 
  the shade of the leaves of the Palm tree of that ..., our Lady and our Holy 
  one of Heaven!</p>
<p>Let the offering of the Sacrifice (He maketh such) and the offering of cakes 
  (He lifteth them) and vessels of libation (He poureth it) be made in them! </p>
<p>My head is like unto the Head of Ra, and my limbs are strong as the limbs of 
  Tum.</p>
<p>My tongue is the tongue of Ptah &amp; my throne is the Throne of our Lady Ahathoor.</p>
<p>I utter the words of my father Tum; the handmaid of Seb is constrained, and 
  all are bowed in fear before me.</p>
<p>They glorify me in their hymns; divine Hair of Seb is the name wherein They 
  do invoke me to protect the Earth, who am its Lord and God. The god Seb refreshing 
  me maketh his ... as mine own. </p>
<p>The dwellers in Amun bow down their heads unto me for I am their Lord, their 
  Bull.</p>
<p>I am more powerful than the Lord of Time; I shall enjoy the pleasures of love, 
  and gain the mastery over millions of years.&quot;</p>
<p>(He then resumeth the Throne of Ra, as the might of god, saying:)</p>
<p>&quot;The light is mine; its rays consume<br>
  Me: I have made a secret door <br>
  Into the House of Ra and Tum,<br>
  Of Khephra and of Ahathoor.<br>
  I am thy Theban, O Mentu<br>
  The prophet Ankh-af-na-khonsu!&quot;</p>
<p>(Rising he moveth to the West or as some say to the South saying with the sign:)</p>
<p>&quot;Hathoor, Lady of Amentet, mighty dweller in the funeral mountain, eye 
  of Ra, dweller before Him, beautiful of fire in the boat of millions of years, 
  be they favorable unto us, and let Thy light and beauty be with us Thy lovers 
  in the House of Peace!</p>
<p>ABRAHADABRA 111 - 11111 - 111 (He knocketh)</p>
<p>[This opening and closing of the Temple is observable on all occasions. Any 
  other ceremony, such as Evocation, Invocation, Initiation and all secret Rituals, 
  should be performed when the Temple is &quot;open&quot;. Also, in the case of 
  Initiations their Birth, Death, and Marriage, (with such additional Rituals 
  as may be taught) should take place actually in an open Temple. </p>
<p>Followeth the ceremony of admitting a Neophyte to the Mysteries, which is to 
  be performed upon him before he is admitted to an Ordeal.]</p>
<p>The Ritual called &quot;Passing through the TUAT&quot;</p>
<p>(The officers are Three in number, invisible are Ta-Nech for Nuit, Bes-n-Maut 
  for Hadit. Thence cometh forth Visable, the lowest point of the Red Triangle 
  of our Order, Ankh-f-n-Khonsu for Ra-Hoor-Khuit. The ceremony is to join the 
  candidate, or ego, with him.</p>
<p>The officer is also Tem, to open, Ra to close; Kephra, to Admit, and Ahathoor, 
  to seal the grade. He is thus the Pentagram in himself, ... the Hierophant. 
  His dress is that of the Magus described by Abramelin. The wand is in his hand; 
  but the spear and sword are ready. The candidate, dresses as is his custom, 
  fasts for four and twenty hours. Before the admission he eats a full meal. Then 
  the officer, approaching sayeth:)</p>
<p>&quot;Hail! hail unto thee O Tum, who comest forth from the abyss of water! 
  Hail unto thee, who shinest with double splendour, let thy words be spoken with 
  might unto those Khus that abide in the Hall, and let ------ Triumphant enter 
  into their assembly. ------ hath performed the decree which hath been spoken 
  to the armies of Ra at eventide; therefore let him/her come forth as a living 
  khu in the place of the Dead; let the gods rejoice , one and all, crying aloud: 
  Hail! ---------- ! even as they cry: Hail, O Ptah that ariseth from the Holy 
  Place of the ancient One that is Annu!&quot;</p>
<p>(The candidate then undresses; and is clad in the shroud of a corpse. His feet 
  and hands are wrapped closely, his mouth is stopped, and his eyes are blindfolded. 
  He is then placed in the Coffin. The officer approaches, now that the coffin 
  has been carried into the darkened temple. He stops with a napkin dipped in 
  the consecrated water the nostrils of the candidate, much distressing him.)</p>
<p>&quot;Hail thou God Temu, grant unto me the sweet breath that dwelleth in thy 
  nostrils!&quot;</p>
<p>(The officer unstops the nostrils of the Candidate, and breaths from his nostrils 
  upon them.)</p>
<p>&quot;Homage to thee, O thou Lord of Brightness, at the head of the great House, 
  prince of the night &amp; of thick darkness, I am come forth as a pure Khu. 
  My two hands are behind me and my lot is as that of my forefathers! O grant 
  thou me thy mouth, that I may speak therewith, and guide thou to me mine heart 
  in the hour of cloud and darkness!&quot;</p>
<p>(The officer removes the mouth wrapping, and kisses the candidate upon the 
  mouth.)</p>
<p>&quot;Homage to thee, O Ra, who in thy setting art Tum-Heru-Khut, of thou divine 
  one, O Thou who hast formulated Thy Father &amp; made fertile thy mother! Thou 
  primeval orb, whence all things arise!</p>
<p>When thou appearest in the back of thy Bark men shout for joy at thee, thou 
  maker of the gods! Thou didst stretch out the heaven wherein thy two eyes might 
  travel, thou didst make the Earth to be a vast chamber for thy Khus, so that 
  every man might know his fellow. The Sektet boat is glad, and the Matet Boat 
  rejoiceth, and they greet thee with exaltation as thou journeyest along. The 
  God Nu is content and thy mariners are satisfied. The Uraeus hath overthrown 
  thine enemies &amp; thou hast carried off the legs of Apep!&quot;</p>
<p>(The officer unbinds the legs of the Candidate.)</p>
<p>&quot;Thou art beautiful O Ra, each day; and thy mother Nuit embraceth thee; 
  thou settest in beauty and thy heart is glad when thou in the horizon of Manu 
  the mountain of the West; and the Holy ones thereof rejoice. The hearts of the 
  Lords of the Tuat are glad when thou sendest forth thy light in Amentet; Their 
  two eyes are directed towards thee!&quot;</p>
<p>(The officer removes the eye-bandage, makes a flash of light, and gazes deeply 
  into the eyes of the candidate, as he says:)</p>
<p>&quot;They press forward to see thee; their hearts rejoice when they see thee 
  at the end!&quot;</p>
<p>Thou hearkeneth unto the cries of them that are in the funeral Chest; thou 
  dost away with their helplessness and drivest away the evils that are about 
  them.&quot;</p>
<p>(The officer unbinds &amp; presses the hands of the candidate.)</p>
<p>&quot;I am thy father that lifteth thee up!&quot;</p>
<p>(He raises the Candidate.)</p>
<p>&quot;Thou givest breath to their nostrils, and they take hold of the bows 
  of thy Bark in the horizon of Manu. Thou art beautiful every day, O Ra! May 
  thy mother Nuit embrace ------ victorious!&quot;</p>
<p>(The officer looses and lets fall the shroud, and embraces the Candidate.</p>
<p>The officer leaves the Candidate, and circumambulates the temple 11 times widdershins, 
  chanting the song 'Even as the traitors breath... etc.)</p>
<p>(He then approaches the Candidate and says:)</p>
<p>&quot;Repeat after me: I who am nothing deny all that I was; I who am nothing 
  affirm all that I shall be. I swear that as Nuit is about me, as Hadit is within 
  me, so am I Ra-Hoor-Khuit! And blessing and worship to the Beast, the prophet 
  of the Lovely Star!&quot;</p>
<p>(The officer withdrawing the brand 666 from the altar, marks the Candidate 
  on brow, heart, &amp; head.</p>
<p>The officer now circumambulates the temple 11 times reciting:)</p>
<p>&quot;I am the girdle of the robe of the god Nu (here he robes the candidate 
  in the proper robe) which shineth and sheddeth light upon that which belongeth 
  to his breast, sending forth light into darkness, bringing to peace the two 
  gods that are at war in his heart.</p>
<p>Mine is the mighty spell that raiseth up him that was fallen. </p>
<p>I have taken possession of the Lord of Darkness; I have rescued the eye of 
  the Sun.</p>
<p>I have brought forth Thoth, and made even the scales of balance.</p>
<p>Mine is the Ureret-Crown; Maat is in my body; its' mouths are of turquoise 
  and rock crystals; my home is among the burrows of lapis-lazuli: I am he that 
  sheddeth light in the darkness: The darkness is made light and bright by me.</p>
<p>I have given light in the darkness.</p>
<p>I have overthrown the devourers.</p>
<p>I have sung praises to them that dwell in the darkness.</p>
<p>I have raised up those that wept, that had hidden their faces and sunk down 
  for sorrow; and they did look upon me.</p>
<p>Hail, for I am He whose voice is silence.</p>
<p>I have opened the way; I have made light the darkness; I am come, having made 
  an end of the darkness, which hath become light indeed.&quot;</p>
<p>(The lights are turned fully on. The candidate is led from the Temple to the 
  ... of the boat. This boat is 7 cubits in length. It is of green porcelain, 
  and canopied with a heaven of stars, consecrated. At the bow is the golden Disk 
  of RA, with his image. The officer says:)</p>
<p>&quot;The paths which are above are laid unto rest ... Hail thou great god 
  who art in thy boat, bring thou me into thy boat.&quot;</p>
<p>(The officer puts the candidate into the boat.)</p>
<p>&quot;I have entered the boat and I sail by the command of Ra. </p>
<p>(Place canopy of heaven over the boat.)</p>
<p>&quot;Get thee back o serpent dwellers in Fire, that maketh to <br>
  cease the motion of my boat. Get thee back to the sky, for that <br>
  which is in my hand is ready.<br>
  I stand up in the place of restraint; the boat advanceth <br>
  taking heed to thy way; thy head is covered up while I sail on <br>
  over the heaven.<br>
  I am he who lifteth up strength; I am come; I am become <br>
  master of the serpents of RA when he setteth in my sight, at <br>
  eventide I go round about heaven; but thou art fettered with the <br>
  fetters that Ra hath ordained. <br>
  I, even I, guide the ... wherewith Apep is driven back, and <br>
  I know the divine souls of the West: Tum, and Sebek the lord of <br>
  Baklan, and Hathoor the lady of the Evening.&quot;</p>
<p>(The boat advances:)</p>
<p>&quot;I, even I know the eastern gate of heaven whence RA cometh <br>
  with a favorable wind. I am the helmsman of the eternal Bark; I <br>
  know the two sycamores of ... between which RA showeth himself.<br>
  I, even I, know the divine souls of the East, Heru-khuit, <br>
  and the calf of the Goddess Khera, the Bright morning star.</p>
<p>(The boat advances to the first Pylon.)</p>
<p>&quot;Get thee back! Return! Get thee back, thou crocodile Sui!<br>
  Thou shalt not advance to me, for I live by the magical <br>
  words of my mouth.&quot;</p>
<p>(The boat circles the Temple deosil, leaves it, &amp; again faces the Pylon. 
  So for each utterance. )</p>
<p>&quot;My front teeth are like knives &amp; my jaw-teeth are like unto <br>
  his that dwelleth upon the Hill of Terror!&quot;</p>
<p>(Circle)</p>
<p>&quot;Hail thou that sittest with thine eyeballs upon my magical words.&quot;</p>
<p>(Circle)</p>
<p>&quot;Thou shalt not carry me away, O thou serpent Rerek, and <br>
  advance not hither unto me! Stand thou still and thou shall eat <br>
  the vat of the abomination unto Ra! Thou shalt crunch the bones <br>
  of the Cat of Slime!&quot;</p>
<p>(Circle)</p>
<p>&quot;Depart from me, Aphast, for thou hast lips that gnaw! For I <br>
  am Khnemu, the Lord of ... Peshemu ... I bring the words of the <br>
  gods to RA.</p>
<p>(Circle)</p>
<p>&quot;Homage to you, ye two Rekht Goddesses, ye sisters twin.&quot;</p>
<p>(Circle)</p>
<p>&quot;Hail ye two Mert goddesses, I bring a message to you <br>
  concerning my magical words.<br>
  I shine from the Sektet boat.<br>
  I am Ra-Hoor-Kaa, the sun of strength and light.&quot;</p>
<p>(Circle)</p>
<p>&quot;Get thee back, depart, get thee back from me, O Apep!<br>
  Depart from the divine place of Ra's birth, where in is the <br>
  House of thy Terror! </p>
<p>I am Ra, terrible and triumphant.<br>
  Ra setteth, Ra setteth; Ra is strong at his setting.<br>
  Apep hath fallen; Apep the enemy of Ra is overcome.</p>
<p>(Circle)</p>
<p>&quot;Get thee back, Hai, thou impure one, abomination of Asar!<br>
  Tahuti hath cut off thine head and I have slain thee and <br>
  hurled thee utterly asunder. Get thee back from the Neshuet boat, <br>
  as with a fair wind Ra saileth over his heaven.</p>
<p>(Circle)</p>
<p>&quot;O thou Scepter of joy! Let me not be hurt of any; nor by <br>
  man, nor by gods, nor by the holy dead, nor by the violently <br>
  slain, nor by them of old times, nor by any mortal, nor by any <br>
  human soul!&quot;</p>
<p>(The boat entereth the temple, and circleth it, but not going out; it is brought 
  to the center thereof. The canopy is removed.)</p>
<p>&quot;My hair is the hair of Nu!<br>
  My face is the face of the Disk!<br>
  My eyes are the eyes of Hathor!<br>
  My ears are the ears of Apu-t!<br>
  My nose is the nose of Kheuti Khas!<br>
  My lips are the lips of Anpu!<br>
  My teeth are the teeth of Serget!<br>
  My neck is the neck of Asi!<br>
  My shoulders are the shoulders of Ba-neb-Tahtu!<br>
  My arms are the arms of Neith!<br>
  My spine is the spine of Sati!<br>
  My phallus is the phallus of Asar!<br>
  (or) My kteis is the kteis of Asi!<br>
  My Sinews are the sinews of the Lords of Keraba!<br>
  My chest is the chest of the mighty and terrible one!<br>
  My belly and back are the belly and back of Sekhet.<br>
  My buttocks are the buttocks of the Eye of Hoor.<br>
  My hips and legs are the hips and legs of Nuit!<br>
  My feet are the feet of Ptah!<br>
  My bones are the bones of the living Gods!<br>
  There is no member of my body that is not the member of some God!</p>
<p>[The officer, who has touched each part of the candidate (as he has named it) 
  with his wand now raises him from the boat, and embraces him, kissing his brow. 
  Then cries he with a loud voice:)</p>
<p>&quot;ABRAHADABRA! I receive thee into the Order of Thelema!&quot;</p>
<p>(He knocks 111 - 11111 - 111 )</p>
<p>(The boat has been removed. The candidate kneels at the altar, while the officer 
  makes &quot;THE GREAT INVOCATION&quot; from his throne.)</p>
<p>(They then walk round the temple eleven times widdershins, the left arm of 
  the officer around the waist of the candidate, and the candidates right arm 
  around him. The officer sayeth as they go:)</p>
<p>&quot;I am a swallow! I am a swallow! I am the scorpion, the <br>
  daughter of Ra.<br>
  Hail thou flame whose scent is sweet!<br>
  Hail, ye gods whose scent is sweet!<br>
  Hail thou flame that cometh from the horizon! <br>
  Hail thou Lord of the city; stretch out thy hand unto me, <br>
  let me advance with my tidings, for my speech is of<br>
  great gladness.<br>
  Open the doors to me, and I will declare the things that I <br>
  have seen!<br>
  Horus hath become the divine Prince of the Boat of the Sun; <br>
  unto him hath been given the name of his father Osiris.<br>
  I have stretched out my arms at the word of Osiris; I am <br>
  entered in, I am justified, I come forth worthy at the gate.<br>
  I am pure at the palace of the passage of souls;<br>
  I have destroyed the evil that clung to my members upon <br>
  earth.<br>
  Hail, ye twin Hawks upon your pinnacles, ye that guard the <br>
  gate of the abyss, for I am made as ye!<br>
  I am He that cometh forth by day.<br>
  I have passed the hidden ways; yea ________, I am He, the <br>
  Bornless Spirit, having Sight in the feet; strong and<br>
  the immortal fire!<br>
  I am He, the Truth!<br>
  I am He, that hate that evil should be wrought in the world!<br>
  I am He, that lighteneth and thundereth!<br>
  I am He, from whom is the shower of the life of Earth.<br>
  I am He, whose mouth ever flameth!<br>
  I am He, the begetter and manifester unto the light.<br>
  I am He, the grace of the World!<br>
  The heart girt with a serpent is my name!&quot;</p>
<p>(They go to the Throne.)</p>
<p>&quot;O my seat, O my Throne, come unto me! and be Ye round about me!&quot;</p>
<p>(He sets the candidate on his Throne.)</p>
<p>&quot;I am your Lord, O ye Gods, Come ye and take your places in my train!&quot;</p>
<p>(The officer prostrates himself before the Candidate, and worships him.)</p>
<p>(The officer rises and takes his spear from beside the candidate. He touches 
  with its point the brand 666 and says:)</p>
<p>&quot;As this brand is not to be effaced from thy body, so is this Initiation 
  not to be effaced from thy soul!&quot;</p>
