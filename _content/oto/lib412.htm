<p>&quot; ... the obeah and the wanga; the work of the wand and the work of the 
  sword; these he shall learn and teach.&quot; Liber AL, I, 37. </p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1">The Pantacle.</a></h3>
<h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
<p>Take pure wax, or a plate of gold, silver-gilt or Electrum Magicum. The diameter 
  shall be eight inches, and the thickness half an inch. <br>
  Let the Neophyte by his understanding and ingenium devise a symbol to represent 
  the Universe. <br>
  Let his Zelator approve thereof. <br>
  Let the Neophyte engrave the same upon the plate with his own hand and weapon. 
  <br>
  Let it when finished be consecrated as he hath skill to formform, and kept wrapped 
  in silk of emerald green. </p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="2">The Dagger.</a></h3>
<h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
<p>Let the Zelator take a piece of pure steel, and beat it, grind it, sharpen 
  it, and polish it, according to the art of the swordsmith. <br>
  Let him further take a piece of oak wood, and carve a hilt. The length shall 
  be eight inches. <br>
  Let him by his understanding and ingenium devise a Word to represent the Universe. 
  <br>
  Let his Practicus approve thereof. <br>
  Let the Zelator engrave the same upon his dagger with his own hand and instruments. 
  <br>
  Let him further gild the wood of his hilt. <br>
  Let it when finished be consecrated as he hath skill to formform, and kept wrapped 
  in silk of golden yellow. </p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="3">The Cup.</a></h3>
<h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
<p>Let the Practicus take a piece of Silver and fashion therefrom a cup. The height 
  shall be 8 inches, and the diameter 3 inches. <br>
  Let him by his understanding and ingenium devise a Number to represent the Universe. 
  <br>
  Let his Philosophus approve thereof. <br>
  Let the Practicus engrave the same upon his cup with his own hand and instrument. 
  <br>
  Let it when finished be consecrated as he hath skill to formform, and kept wrapped 
  in silk of azure blue. </p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="4">The Baculum.</a></h3>
<h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
<p>Let the Philosophus take a rod of copper, of length eight inches and diameter 
  half an inch. <br>
  Let him fashion about the top a triple flame of gold. <br>
  Let him by his understanding and ingenium devise a Deed to represent the Universe. 
  <br>
  Let his Dominus Liminis approve thereof. <br>
  Let the Philosophus formform the same in such a way that the Baculum may be 
  partaker therein. <br>
  Let it when finished be consecrated as he hath skill to formform, and kept wrapped 
  in silk of fiery scarlet. </p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="5">The Lamp.</a></h3>
<h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
<p>Let the Dominus Liminis take pure lead, tin, and quicksilver, with platinum, 
  and, if need be, glass. <br>
  Let him by his understanding and ingenium devise a Magick Lamp that shall burn 
  without wick or oil, being fed by the Aethyr. <br>
  This shall he accomplish secretly and apart, without asking the advice or approval 
  of his Adeptus Minor. <br>
  Let the Dominus Liminis keep it when consecrated in the secret chamber of Art. 
  <br>
  This then is that which is written: &quot;Bring furnished with complete armour 
  and armed, he is similar to the goddess.&quot; <br>
  And again, &quot;I am armed, I am armed.&quot;</p>
