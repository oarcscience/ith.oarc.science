  The Magus with Wand. On the Altar are incense, Fire, Bread, Wine, the Chain, 
  the Scourge, the Dagger &amp; the Oil. In his left hand the Bell he taketh. 
</h4>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Hail! Asi! hail, Hoor-Apep! Let<br>
    The Silence speech beget! Two strokes on Bell. <br>
    Banishing Spiral Dance.<br>
    The Words against the Sons of Night<br>
    Tahuti speaketh in the Light.<br>
    Knowledge &amp; Power, twin warriors, shake<br>
    The Invisible; they roll asunder<br>
    The Darkness; matter shines, a snake.<br>
    Sebek is smitten by the thunderÄ<br>
    The Light breaks forth from Under. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes to the West, in the centre of the base of the Triangle of THOTH (Maim), 
  ASI (Aleph), &amp; HOOR (Shin).</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>O Thou, the Apex of the Plane,<br>
    With Ibis head &amp; Phoenix Wand<br>
    And Wings of Night! Whose serpents strain<br>
    Thou in the Light &amp; in the Night! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He lays the Wand, etc., on the Altar, uses the Scourge on his buttocks, cuts 
  a cross with the Daggar upon his breast &amp; tightens the Chain of the Bell 
  about his forehead, saying:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The Lustral Water! Smite thy flood<br>
    Through meÄLymph, marrow &amp; blood! Annointing the Wounds, say<br>
    The Fire Informing! Let the Oil<br>
    Balance, assain, assoil! The Invoking Spiral Dance.<br>
    So Life takes Fire from Death, &amp; runs<br>
    Whirling amid the Suns.<br>
    Hail, Asi! Pace the Path, bind on<br>
    The girdle of the Starry One! <br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sign of the Enterer: Homage to Thee, Lord of the Word! Sign of Silence: Lord 
  of Silence, Homage to Thee! Repeat both Signs: Lord we adore Thee, still &amp; 
  stirred Beyond Infinity. The Secret Word: MTzThBTzMÄ271 (Blue, Orange, Yellow-Green, 
  Yellow, Orange, Blue) </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>For from the Silence of the Wand<br>
    Unto the Speaking of the Sword,<br>
    And back again to the Beyond,<br>
    This is the toil &amp; the Reward.<br>
    This is the Path of HVAÄHo!<br>
    This is the Path of IAO. Bell.<br>
    Hail Asi! Hail, thou Wanded Wheel!<br>
    Alpha &amp; Delta kissed &amp; came<br>
    For five that feed the Flame. Bell.<br>
    Hail, Hoor-Apep! thou Sword of Steel!<br>
    Alpha &amp; Delta &amp; Epsilon<br>
    Met in the Shadow of the Pylon<br>
    And in Iota did proclaim<br>
    That tenfold core &amp; crown of flame.<br>
    Hail, Hoor-Apep! Unspoken Name! <br>
    Thus is the Great Pyramid duly builded. </p>

  The Candidate still bound and hoodwinked. The First Pylon. </h4>

    I know not whither I go; I seekÄbut What I do<br>

    Ring through Eternity; Arise &amp; follow me! </p>

  <p>Asar Un-nefer! I invoke<br>
    The four-fold Horror of the Smoke.<br>
    Unloose the Pit! by the dread Word<br>
    Of PowerÄthat Set-Typhon hath heardÄ SAZAZSAZAZADANATASANSAZAZ </p>

    The Fear of Him, the Demon dire<br>
    That on the Threshold of the Inane<br>
    Stands with his Dragon Fear to slay<br>
    The Pilgrim of the Way.<br>
    Thus I pass by with Force &amp; Care,<br>

    (Suit action to words.)<br>

    Who pins me down? Who stabs my heart?<br>
    I am unfit to pass within this Pylon of the Hall of Maat. </p>

<p>Rubric as above. (The Fear....surely Infinite.)</p>
