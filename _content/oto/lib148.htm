<p>&quot;Expect seven misfortunes from the cripple, and forty-two from the one-eyed

  <RIGHT> ARAB PROVERB</RIGHT> </p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="1">I</a></h3>
<h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
<p>INQUIRY. Let us inquire in the first place: What is Scepticism? The word means 
  looking, questioning, investigating. One must pass by contemptuously the Christian 
  liar's gloss which interprets &quot;sceptic&quot; as &quot;mocker&quot;; though 
  in a sense it is true for him, since to inquire into Christianity is assuredly 
  to mock at it; but I am concerned to intensify the etymological connotation 
  in several respects. First, I do not regard mere incredulity as necessary to 
  the idea, though credulity is incompatible with it. Incredulity implies a prejudice 
  in favour of a negative conclusion; and the true sceptic should be perfectly 
  unbiassed. </p>
<p>Second, I exclude &quot;vital scepticism.&quot; What's the good of anyfink? 
  expects (as we used to learn about &quot;nonne?&quot;) the answer, &quot;Why 
  nuffink!&quot; and again is prejudiced. Indolence is no virtue in a questioner. 
  Eagerness, intentness, concentration, vigilance --- all these I include in the 
  connotation of &quot;sceptic.&quot; Such questioning as has been called &quot;vital 
  scepticism&quot; is but a device to avoid true questioning, and therefore its 
  very antithesis, the devil disguised as an angel of light. </p>
<p>[Or &quot;vice vers&#131;&quot;, friend, if you are a Satanist; 'tis a matter 
  of words --- words --- words. You may write &quot;x&quot; for &quot;y&quot; 
  in your equations, so long as you consistently write &quot;y&quot; for &quot;x&quot;. 
  They remain unchanged --- and unsolved. Is not all our &quot;knowledge&quot; 
  an example of this fallacy of writing one unknown for another, and then crowing 
  like Peter's cock?] </p>
<p>I picture the true sceptic as a man eager and alert, his deep eyes glittering 
  like sharp swords, his hands tense with effort as he asks, &quot;What does it 
  matter?&quot; </p>
<p>I picture the false sceptic as a dude or popinjay, yawning, with dull eyes, 
  his muscles limp, his purpose in asking the question but the expression of his 
  slackness and stupidity. </p>
<p>This true sceptic is indeed the man of science; as Wells' &quot;Moreau&quot; 
  tells us. He has devised some means of answering his first question, and its 
  answer is another question. It is difficult to conceive of any question, indeed, 
  whose answer does not imply a thousand further questions. So simple an inquiry 
  as &quot;Why is sugar sweet?&quot; involves an infinity of chemical researches, 
  each leading ultimately to the blank wall --- what is matter? and an infinity 
  of physiological researches, each (similarly) leading to the blank wall --- 
  what is mind? </p>
<p>Even so, the relation between the two ideas is unthinkable; causality is itself 
  unthinkable; it depends, for one thing, upon experience --- and what, in God's 
  name, is experience? Experience is impossible without memory. What is memory? 
  The mortar of the temple of the ego, whose bricks are the impressions. And the 
  ego? The sum of our experience, may be. (I doubt it!) Anyhow, we have got values 
  of &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; for &quot;x&quot;, and the values of &quot;x&quot; 
  and &quot;z&quot; for &quot;y&quot; --- all our equations are indeterminate; 
  all our knowledge is relative, even in a narrower sense than is usually implied 
  by the statement. Under the whip of the clown God, our performing donkeys the 
  philosophers and men of science run round and round in the ring; they have amusing 
  tricks: they are cleverly trained; but they get nowhere. </p>
<p>I don't seem to be getting anywhere myself.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="2">II</a></h3>
<h4><a href="#Index">Tp</a> </h4>
<p>A fresh attempt. Let us look into the simplest and most certain of all possible 
  statements. &quot;Thought exists&quot;, or if you will, &quot;Cogitatur&quot;. 
</p>
<p>Descartes supposed himself to have touched bed-rock with his &quot;Cogito,&quot; 
  &quot;ergo Sum.&quot; </p>
<p>Huxley pointed out the complex nature of this proposition, and that it was 
  an enthymeme with the premiss &quot;Omnes sunt, qui cogitant&quot; suppressed. 
  He reduced it to &quot;Cogito;&quot; or, to avoid the assumption of an ego, 
  &quot;Cogitatur.&quot; </p>
<p>Examining more closely this statement, we may still cavil at its form. We cannot 
  translate it into English without the use of the verb to be, so, that, after 
  all, existence is implied. Nor do we readily conceive that contemptuous silence 
  is sufficient answer of the further query, &quot;By whom is it thought?&quot; 
  The Buddhist may find it easy to image an act without an agent; I am not so 
  clever. It may be possible for a sane man; but I should like to know more about 
  his mind before I gave a final opinion. </p>
<p>But apart from purely formal objections, we may still inquire: Is this &quot;Cogitatur&quot; 
  true? </p>
<p>Yes; reply the sages; for to deny it implies thought; &quot;Negatur&quot; is 
  only a sub-section of &quot;Cogitatur&quot;. </p>
<p>This involves, however, an axiom that the part is of the same nature as the 
  whole; or (at the very least) an axiom that &quot;A&quot; is &quot;A&quot;. 
</p>
<p>Now, I do not wish to deny that &quot;A&quot; is &quot;A&quot;, or may occasionally 
  be &quot;A&quot;. But certainly &quot;A is A&quot; is a very different statement 
  to our original &quot;Cogitatur&quot;. </p>
<p>The proof of &quot;Cogitatur&quot;, in short, rests not upon itself but upon 
  the validity of our logic; and if by logic we mean (as we should mean) the Code 
  of the Laws of Thought, the irritating sceptic will have many more remarks to 
  make: for it now appears that the proof that &quot;thought exists&quot; depends 
  upon the truth of that which is thought, to say no more. </p>
<p>We have taken &quot;Cogitatur&quot;, to try and avoid the use of &quot;esse;&quot; 
  but &quot;A is A&quot; involves that very idea, and the proof is fatally flawed. 
</p>
<p>&quot;Cogitatur&quot; depends on &quot;Est;&quot; and there's no avoiding it.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="3">III</a></h3>
<h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
<p>Shall we get on any better if we investigate this &quot;Est&quot; --- Something 
  is --- Existence is --- HB:Heh HB:Yod HB:Heh HB:Aleph HB:Resh HB:Shin HB:Aleph 
  HB:Heh HB:Yod HB:Heh HB:Aleph ? </p>
<p>What is Existence? The question is so fundamental that it finds no answer. 
  The most profound meditation only leads to an exasperating sense of impotence. 
  There is, it seems, no simple rational idea in the mind which corresponds to 
  the word. </p>
<p>It is easy of course to drown the question in definitions, leading us to further 
  complexity --- but </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>&quot;Existence is the gift of Divine Providence,&quot;<br>
        &quot;Existence is the opposite of Non-Existence,&quot; </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>do not help us much! </p>
<p>The plain &quot;Existence is Existence&quot; of the Hebrews goes farther. It 
  is the most sceptical of statements, in spite of its form. Existence is just 
  existence, and there's no more to be said about it; don't worry! Ah, but there 
  is more to be said about it! Though we search ourselves for a thought to match 
  the word, and fail, yet we have Berkeley's perfectly convincing argument that 
  (so far as we know it) existence must mean &quot;thinking existence&quot; or 
  &quot;spiritual existence&quot;. </p>
<p>Here then we find our &quot;Est&quot; to imply &quot;Cogitatur;&quot; and Berkeley's 
  arguments are &quot;irrefragable, yet fail to produce conviction&quot; (Hume) 
  because the &quot;Cogitatur;&quot; as we have shown, implies &quot;Est&quot;. 
</p>
<p>Neither of these ideas is simple; each involves the other. Is the division 
  between them in our brain a proof of the total incapacity of that organ, or 
  is there some flaw in our logic? For all depends upon our logic; not upon the 
  simple identity &quot;A is A&quot; only, but upon its whole structure from the 
  question of simple propositions, enormously difficult from the moment when it 
  occurred to the detestable genius that invented &quot;existential import&quot; 
  to consider the matter, to that further complexity and contradiction, the syllogism. 
</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="4">IV</a></h3>
<h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
<p>&quot;Thought is&quot; appears then (in the worst case possible, denial) as 
  the conclusion of the premisses: </p>
<p>There is denial of thought. </p>
<p>(All) Denial of thought is thought. </p>
<p>Even formally, 'tis a clumsy monster. Essentially, it seems to involve a great 
  deal beyond our original statement. We compass heaven and earth to make one 
  syllogism; and when we have made it, it is tenfold more the child of mystery 
  than ourselves. </p>
<p>We cannot here discuss the whole problem of the validity (the surface- question 
  of the logical validity) of the syllogism; though one may throw out the hint 
  that the doctrine of distributed middle seems to assume a knowledge of a Calculus 
  of Infinites which is certainly beyond my own poor attainments, and hardly impregnable 
  to the simple reflection that all mathematics is conventional, and not essential; 
  relative, and not absolute. </p>
<p>We go deeper and deeper, then, it seems, from the One into the Many. Our primary 
  proposition depends no longer upon itself, but upon the whole complex being 
  of man, poor, disputing, muddle-headed man! Man with all his limitations and 
  ignorance; man --- man! </p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="5">V</a></h3>
<h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
<p>We are of course no happier when we examine the Many, separately or together. 
  They converge and diverge, each fresh hill-toÿ of knowledge disclosing a vast 
  land unexplored; each gain of power in our telescÿes opening out new galaxies; 
  each improvement in our microscoÿes showing us life minuter and more incomprehensible. 
  A mystery of the mighty spaces between molecules; a mystery of the ether-cushions 
  that fend off the stars from collision! A mystery of the fulness of things; 
  a mystery of the emptiness of things! Yet, as we go, there grows a sense, an 
  instinct, a premonition --- what shall I call it? --- that Being is One, and 
  Thought is One, and Law is One --- until we ask What is that One? </p>
<p>Then again we spin words --- words --- words. And we have got no single question 
  answered in any ultimate sense. </p>
<p>What is the moon made of? </p>
<p>Science replies &quot;Green Cheese.&quot; </p>
<p>For our one moon we have now two ideas: </p>
<p>&quot;Greenness,&quot; and &quot;Cheese.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Greenness&quot; depends on the sunlight, and the eye, and a thousand 
  other things. </p>
<p>&quot;Cheese&quot; depends on bacteria and fermentation and the nature of the 
  cow. </p>
<p>&quot;Deeper, even deeper, into the mire of things!&quot; </p>
<p>Shall we cut the Gordian knot? shall we say &quot;There is God&quot;? </p>
<p>What, in the devil's name, is God? </p>
<p>If (with Moses) we picture Him as an old man showing us His back parts, who 
  shall blame us? The great Question --- &quot;any&quot; question is the great 
  question --- does indeed treat us thus cavalierly, the disenchanted Sceptic 
  is too prone to think! </p>
<p>Well, shall we define Him as a loving Father, as a jealous priest, as a gleam 
  of light upon the holy Ark? What does it matter? All these images are of wood 
  and stone, the wood and stone of our own stupid brains! The Fatherhood of God 
  is but a human type; the idea of a human father conjoined with the idea of immensity. 
  Two for One again! </p>
<p>No combination of thoughts can be greater than the thinking brain itself; all 
  we can think of God or say of Him, so long as our words really represent thoughts, 
  is less than the whole brain which thinks, and orders speech. </p>
<p>Very good; shall we proceed by denying Him all thinkable qualities, as do the 
  heathen? All we obtain is mere negation of thought. </p>
<p>Either He is unknowable, or He is less than we are. Then, too, that which is 
  unknowable is unknown; and &quot;God&quot; or &quot;There is God&quot; as an 
  answer to our question becomes as meaningless as any other. </p>
<p>Who are we, then? </p>
<p>We are Spencerian Agnostics, poor silly, damned Spencerian Agnostics! </p>
<p>And there is an end of the matter. </p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="6">VI</a></h3>
<h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
<p>It is surely time that we began to question the validity of some of our data. 
  So far our scepticism has not only knocked to pieces our tower of thought, but 
  rooted up the foundation-stone and ground it into finer and more poisonous powder 
  than that into which Moses ground the calf. These golden Elohim! Our calf-heads 
  that brought us not out of Egypt, but into a darkness deeper and more tangible 
  than any darkness of the double Empire of Asar. </p>
<p>Hume put his little ? to Berkeley's God-!; Buddha his ? to the Vedic Atman-! 
  --- and neither Hume nor Buddha was baulked of his reward. Ourselves may put 
  ? to our own ? since we have found no ! to put it to; and wouldn't it be jolly 
  if our own second ? suddenly straightened its back and threw its chest out and 
  marched off as !? </p>
<p>Suppose then we accept our scepticism as having destroyed our knowledge root 
  and branch --- is there no limit to its action? Does it not in a sense stultify 
  itself? Having destroyed logic by logic --- if Satan cast out Satan, how shall 
  his kingdom stand? </p>
<p>Let us stand on the Mount, Saviours of the World that we are, and answer &quot;Get 
  thee behind me Satan!&quot; though refraining from quoting texts or giving reasons. 
</p>
<p>Oho! says somebody; is Aleister Crowley here? --- Samson blinded and bound, 
  grinding corn for the Philistines! </p>
<p>Not at all, dear boy! </p>
<p>We shall put all the questions that we can put --- but we may find a tower 
  built upon a rock, against which the winds beat in vain. </p>
<p>Not what Christians call faith, be sure! But what (possibly) the forgers of 
  the Epistles --- those eminent mystics! --- meant by faith. What I call Samadhi 
  --- and as &quot;faith without works is dead,&quot; so, good friends, Samadhi 
  is all humbug unless the practitioner shows the glint of its gold in his work 
  in the world. If your mystic becomes Dante, well; if Tennyson, a fig for his 
  trances! </p>
<p>But how does this tower of Samadhi stand the assault of Question-time? </p>
<p>Is not the idea of Samadhi just as dependent on all the other ideas --- man, 
  time, being, thought, logic? If I seek to explain Samadhi by analogy, am I not 
  often found talking as if we knew all about Evolution, and Mathematics, and 
  History? Complex and unscientific studies, mere straws before the blast of our 
  hunchback friend! </p>
<p>Well, one of the buttresses is just the small matter of common sense. </p>
<p>The other day I was with Dorothy, and, as I foolishly imagined, very cosy: 
  for her sandwiches are celebrated. It was surely bad taste on the part of Father 
  Bernard Vaughan, and Dr. Torrey, and Ananda Metteyya, and Mr. G. W. Foote, and 
  Captain Fuller, and the ghost of Immanuel Kant, and Mr. Bernard Shaw, and young 
  Neuburg, to intrude. But intrude they did; and talk! I never heard anything 
  like it. Every one with his own point of view; but all agreed that Dorothy was 
  non-existent, or if existent, a most awful specimen, that her buns were stale, 
  and her tea stewed; &quot;ergo,&quot; that I was having a very poor time of 
  it. Talk! Good God! But Dorothy kept on quietly and took no notice; and in the 
  end I forgot about them. </p>
<p>Thinking it over soberly, I see now that very likely they were quite right: 
  I can't prove it either way. But as a mere practical man, I intend taking the 
  steamer --- for my sins I am in Gibraltar --- back to Dorothy at the earliest 
  possible moment. Sandwiches of bun and German sausage may be vulgar and even 
  imaginary --- it's the taste I like. And the more I munch, the more complacent 
  I feel, until I go so far as to offer my critics a bite. </p>
<p>This sounds in a way like the &quot;Interior Certainly&quot; of the common 
  or garden Christian; but there are differences. </p>
<p>The Christian insists on notorious lies being accepted as an essential part 
  of his (more usually her) system; I, on the contrary, ask for facts, for observation. 
  Under Scepticism, true, one is just as much a house of cards as the other; but 
  only in the philosophical sense. </p>
<p>Practically, Science is is true; and Faith is foolish. </p>
<p>Practically, 3 x 1 = 3 is the truth; and 3 x 1 = 1 is a lie; though, sceptically, 
  both statements may be false or unintelligible. </p>
<p>Practically, Franklin's method of obtaining fire from heaven is better than 
  that of Prometheus or Elijah. I am now writing by the light that Franklin's 
  discovery enabled men to use. </p>
<p>Practically, &quot;I concentrated my mind upon a white radiant triangle in 
  whose centre was a shining eye, for 22 minutes and 10 seconds, my attention 
  wandering 45 times&quot; is a scientific and valuable statement. &quot;I prayed 
  fervently to the Lord for the space of many days&quot; means anything or nothing. 
  Anybody who cares to do so may imitate my experiment and compare his result 
  with mine. In the latter case one would always be wondering what &quot;fervently&quot; 
  meant and who &quot;the Lord&quot; was, and how many days made &quot;many.&quot; 
</p>
<p>My claim, too, is more modest than the Christian's. He (usually she) knows 
  more about my future than is altogether pleasant; I claim nothing absolute from 
  my Samadhi --- I know only too well the worthlessness of single-handed observations, 
  even on so simple a matter as a boiling- point determination! --- and as for 
  his (usually her) future, I content myself with mere common sense about the 
  probable end of a fool. </p>
<p>So that after all I keep my scepticism intact - and I keep my Samadhi intact. 
  The one balances the other; I care nothing for the vulgar brawling of these 
  two varlets of my mind! </p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="7">VII</a></h3>
<h4><a href="#Index">Tp</a> </h4>
<p>If, however, you would really like to know what might be said on the soldierly 
  side of the question, I shall endeavour to oblige. </p>
<p>It is necessary if a question is to be intelligibly put that the querent should 
  be on the same plane as the quesited. </p>
<p>Answer is impossible if you ask: Are round squares triangular? or Is butter 
  virtuous? or How many ounces go to the shilling? for the &quot;questions&quot; 
  are not really questions at all. </p>
<p>So if you ask me Is Samadhi real? I reply: First, I pray you, establish a connection 
  between the terms. What do you mean by Samadhi? </p>
<p>There is a physiological (or pathological; never mind now!) state which I call 
  Samadhi; and that state is as real - in relation to man - as sleep, or intoxication, 
  or death. </p>
<p>Philosophically, we may doubt the existence of all of these; but we have no 
  grounds for discriminating between them - the Academic Scepticism is a wholesale 
  firm, I hope! - and practically, I challenge you to draw valid distinctions. 
</p>
<p>All these are states of the consciousness of man; and if you seek to destroy 
  one, all fall together. </p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="8">VIII</a></h3>
<h4><a href="#Index">Tp</a> </h4>
<p>I must, at the risk of appearing to digress, insist upon this distinction between 
  philosoÿhical and practical points of view, or (in Qabalistic language) between 
  Kether and Malkuth. </p>
<p>In private conversation I find it hard - almost impossible - to get peoÿle 
  to understand what seems to me so very simple a point. I shall try to make it 
  exceptionally clear. </p>
<p>A boot is an Illusion. </p>
<p>A hat is an illusion. </p>
<p>&quot;Therefore,&quot; a boot is a hat. </p>
<p>So argue my friends, not distributing the middle term. </p>
<p>But this argue I. </p>
<p>&quot;Therefore&quot; (though it is not a syllogism), all boots and hats are 
  illusions. </p>
<p>I add: </p>
<p>To the man in Kether no illusions matter. </p>
<p>&quot;Therefore:&quot; To the man in Kether neither boots nor hats matter. 
</p>
<p>In fact, the man in Kether is out of all relation to these boots and hats. 
</p>
<p>You, they say, claim to be a man in Kether (I don't). Why then, do you not 
  wear boots on your head and hats on your feet? </p>
<p>I can only answer that I the man in Kether ('tis but an argument) am out of 
  all relation as much with feet and heads as with boots and hats. But why should 
  I (from my exalted pinnacle) stoop down and worry the headed and footed gentleman 
  in Malkuth, who after all doesn't exist for me, by these drastic alterations 
  in his toilet? There is no distinction whatever; I might easily put the boots 
  on his shoulders, with his head on one foot and the hat on the other. </p>
<p>In short, why not be a clean-living Irish gentleman, even if you do have insane 
  ideas about the universe? </p>
<p>Very good, say my friends, unabashed, then why not stick to that? Why glorify 
  Spanish gipsies when you have married a clergyman's daughter? </p>
<p>Why go about proclaiming that you can get as good fun for eighteenpence as 
  usually costs men a career? </p>
<p>Ah! let me introduce you to the man in Tiphereth; that is, the man who is trying 
  to raise his consciousness from Malkuth to Kether. </p>
<p>This Tiphereth man is in a devil of a hole! He knows theoretically all about 
  the Kether point of view (or thinks he does) and practically all about the Malkuth 
  point of view. Consequently he goes about contradicting Malkuth; he refuses 
  to allow Malkuth to obsess his thought. He keeps on crying out that there is 
  no difference between a goat and a God, in the hope of hypnotising himself (as 
  it were) into that perception of their identity, which is his (partial and incorrect) 
  idea of how things look from Kether. </p>
<p>This man performs great magic; very strong medicine. He does really find gold 
  on the midden and skeletons in pretty girls. </p>
<p>In Abiegnus the Sacred Mountain of the Rosicrucians the Postulant finds but 
  a coffin in the central shrine; yet that coffin contains Christian Rosencreutz 
  who is dead and is alive for evermore and hath the keys of Hell and of Death. 
</p>
<p>Ay! your Tiphereth man, child of Mercy and Justice, looks deeper than the skin! 
</p>
<p>But he seems a ridiculous object enough both to the Malkuth man and to the 
  Kether man. </p>
<p>Still, he's the most interesting man there is; and we all must pass through 
  that stage before we get our heads really clear, the Kether-vision above the 
  Clouds that encircle the mountain Abiegnus. </p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="9">IX</a></h3>
<h4><a href="#Index">Top</a> </h4>
<p>Running and returning, like the Cherubim, we may now resume our attempt to 
  drill our hunchback friend into a presentable soldier. The digression will not 
  have been all digression, either; for it will have thrown a deal of light on 
  the question of the limitations of scepticism. </p>
<p>We have questioned the Malkuth point of view; it appears absurd, be it agreed. 
  But the Tiphereth position is unshaken; Tiphereth needs no telling that Malkuth 
  is absurd. When we turn our artillery against Tiphereth, that too crumbles; 
  but Kether frowns above us. </p>
<p>Attack Kether, and it falls; but the Yetziratic Malkuth is still there .... 
  until we reach Kether of Atziluth and the Infinite Light, and Space, and Nothing. 
</p>
<p>So then we retire up the path, fighting rear-guard actions; at every moment 
  a soldier is slain by a hunchback; but as we retire there is always a soldier 
  just by us. </p>
<p>Until the end. The end? Buddha thought the supply of hunchbacks infinite; but 
  why should not the soldiers themselves be infinite in number? </p>
<p>However that may be, here is the point; it takes a moment for a hunchback to 
  kill his man, and the farther we get from our base the longer it takes. You 
  may crumble to ashes the dream-world of a boy, as it were, between your fingers; 
  but before you can bring the physical universe tumbling about a man's ears he 
  requires to drill his hunchbacks so devilish well that they are terribly like 
  soldiers themselves. And a question capable of shaking the consciousness of 
  Samadhi could, I imagine, give long odds to one of Frederick's grenadiers. </p>
<p>It is useless to attack the mystic by asking him if he is quite sure Samadhi 
  is good for his poor health; 'tis like asking the huntsman to be very careful, 
  please, not to hurt the fox. </p>
<p>The ultimate Question, the one that really knocks Samadhi to pieces, is such 
  a stupendous Idea that it is far more of a ! than all previous !'s whatever, 
  for all its ? form. </p>
<p>And the name of that Question is Nibbana. </p>
<p>Take this matter of the soul. </p>
<p>When Mr. Judas McCabbage asks the Man in the Street why he believes in a soul, 
  the Man stammers out that he has always heard so; naturally McCabbage has no 
  difficulty in proving to him by biological methods that he has no soul; and 
  with a sunny smile each passes on his way. </p>
<p>But McCabbage is wasted on the philosopher whose belief in a soul rests on 
  introspection; we must have heavier metal; Hume will serve our turn, may be. 
</p>
<p>But Hume in his turn becomes perfectly futile, pitted against the Hindu mystic, 
  who is in constant intense enjoyment of his new-found Atman. It takes a Buddha-gun 
  to knock &quot;his&quot; castle down. </p>
<p>Now the ideas of McCabbage are banal and dull; those of Hume are live and virile; 
  there is a joy in them greater than the joy of the Man in the Street. So too 
  the Buddha-thought, Anatta, is a more splendid conception than the philosopher's 
  Dutch-doll-like Ego, or the rational artillery of Hume. </p>
<p>This weapon, too, that has destroyed our lesser, our illusionary universes, 
  ever revealing one more real, shall we not wield it with divine ecstasy? Shall 
  we not, too, perceive the inter-dependence of the Questions and the Answers, 
  the necessary connection of the one with the other, so that (just as 0 x ì is 
  an indefinite) we destroy the absolutism of either ? or ! by their alternation 
  and balance, until in our series ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ... ! ? ! ? ... we care nothing 
  as to which may prove the final term, any single term being so negligible a 
  quantity in relation to the vastness of the series? Is it not a series of geometrical 
  progression, with a factor positive and incalculably vast? </p>
<p>In the light of the whole process, then, we perceive that there is no absolute 
  value in the swing of the pendulum, thought its shaft lengthen, its rate grow 
  slower, and its sweep wider at every swing. </p>
<p>What should interest us is the consideration of the Point from which it hangs, 
  motionless at the height of things! We are unfavourably placed to observe this, 
  desperately clinging as we are to the bob of the pendulum, sick with our senseless 
  swinging to and fro in the abyss! </p>
<p>We must climb up the shaft to reach that point --- but --- wait one moment! 
  How obscure and subtle has our simile become! Can we attach any true meaning 
  to the phrase? I doubt it, seeing what we have taken for the limits of the swing. 
  True, it may be that at the end the swing is always 360ø so that the !-point 
  and the ?-point coincide; but that is not the same thing as having no swing 
  at all, unless we make kinematics identical with statics. </p>
<p>What is to be done? How shall such mysteries be uttered? </p>
<p>Is this how it is that the true Path of the Wise is said to lie in a totally 
  different plane from all his advance in the path of Knowledge, and of Trance? 
  We have already been obliged to take the Fourth Dimension to illustrate (if 
  not explain) the nature of Samadhi. </p>
<p>Ah, say the adepts, Samadhi is not the end , but the beginning. You must regard 
  Samadhi as the normal state of mind which enables you to begin your researches, 
  just as waking is the state from which you rise to Samadhi, sleep the state 
  from which you rose to waking. And only from Sammasamadhi --- continuous trance 
  of the right kind --- can you rise up as it were on tiptoe and peer through 
  the clouds unto the mountains. </p>
<p>Now of course it is really awfully decent of the adepts to take all that trouble 
  over us, and to put it so nicely and clearly. All we have to do, you see, is 
  to acquire Sammasamadhi, and then rise on tiptoe. Just so! </p>
<p>But there there are the other adepts. Hard at him! Little brother, he says, 
  let us rather consider that as the pendulum swings more and more slowly every 
  time, it must ultimately stp, as soon as the shaft is of infinite length. Good! 
  then it isn't a pendulum at all but a Mahalingam --- The Mahalingam of Shiva 
  (&quot;Namo Shivaya namaha Aum!&quot;) which is all I ever thought it was; all 
  you have to do is to keep swinging hard --- I know it's hook-swinging! --- and 
  you get there in the End. Why trouble to swing? First, because you are bound 
  to swing, whether you like it or not; second, because your attention is thereby 
  distracted from those lumbar muscles in which the hook is so very firmly fixed; 
  third, because after all it's a ripping good game; fourth, because you want 
  to get on, and even to seem to progress is better than standing still. A treadmill 
  is admittedly good exercise. </p>
<p>True, the question, &quot;Why become an Aarhat?&quot; should precede, &quot;How 
  become an Arahat?&quot; but an unbiassed man will easily cancel the first question 
  with &quot;Why not?&quot; --- the How is not so easy to get rid of. Then, from 
  the standpoint of the Arahat himself, perhaps this &quot;Why did I become an 
  Arahat?&quot; and &quot;How did I become an Arahat?&quot; have but a single 
  solution! </p>
<p>In any case, we are wasting our time --- we are as ridiculous with our Arahats 
  as Herod the Tetrarch with his peacocks! We pose Life with the question Why? 
  and the first answer is: To obtain the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy 
  Guardian Angel. </p>
<p>To attach meaning to this statement we must obtain that Knowledge and Conversation: 
  and when we have done that, we may proceed to the next Question. It is no good 
  asking it now. </p>
<p>&quot;There are purse-proud, penniless ones who stand at the door of the tavern, 
  and revile the guests.&quot; </p>
<p>We attach little importance to the Reverend Out-at-Elbows, thundering in Bareboards 
  Chapel that the rich man gets no enjoyment from his wealth. </p>
<p>Good, then. Let us obtain the volume entitled &quot;The Book of the Sacred 
  Magick of Abramelin the Mage&quot;; or the magical writings of that holy illuminated 
  Man of God, Captain Fuller, and carry out fully their instructions. </p>
<p>And only when we have succeeded, when we have put a colossal ! against our 
  vital ? need we inquire whether after all the soldier is not going to develoÿ 
  spinal curvature. </p>
<p>Let us take the first step; let us sing: </p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;I do not ask to see <br>
    The distant path; one step's enough for me.&quot; </li>
</ul>
<p>But (you will doubtless say) I pith your ? itself with another ?: Why question 
  life at all? Why not remain &quot;a clean-living Irish gentleman&quot; content 
  with his handicap, and contemptuous of card and pencil? Is not the Buddha's 
  goad &quot;Everything is sorrow&quot; little better than a currish whine? What 
  do I care for old age, disease, and death? I'm a man, and a Celt at that. I 
  spit on your snivelling Hindu prince, emasculate with debauchery in the first 
  place, and asceticism in the second. A weak, dirty, paltry cur, sir, your Gautama! 
</p>
<p>Yes, I think I have no answer to that. The sudden apprehension of some vital 
  catastrophe may have been the exciting cause of my conscious devotion to the 
  attainment of Adeptship --- but surely the capacity was there, inborn. Mere 
  despair and desire can do little; anyway, the first impulse of fear was the 
  passing spasm of an hour; the magnetism of the path itself was the true lure. 
  It is as foolish to ask me &quot;Why do you adep?&quot; as to ask God &quot;Why 
  do you pardon?&quot; &quot;C'est son m&#130;tier.&quot; </p>
<p>I am not so foolish as to think that my doctrine can ever gain the ear of the 
  world. I expect that ten centuries hence the &quot;nominal Crowleians&quot; 
  will be as pestilent and numerous a body as the &quot;nominal Christians&quot; 
  are to-day; for (at present) I have been able to devise no mechanism for excluding 
  them. Rather, perhaps, should I seek to find them a niche in the shrine, just 
  as Hinduism provides alike for those capable of the Upanishads and those whose 
  intelligence hardly reaches to the Tantras. In short, one must abandon the reality 
  of religion for a sham, so that the religion may be universal enough for those 
  few who are capable of its reality to nestle to its breast, and nurse their 
  nature on its starry milk. But we anticipate! </p>
<p>My message is then twofold; to the greasy &quot;bourgeois&quot; I preach discontent; 
  I shock him, I stagger him, I cut away earth from under his feet, I turn him 
  upside down, I give him hashish and make him run amok, I twitch his buttocks 
  with the red-hot tongs of my Sadistic fancy -- until he feels uncomfortable. 
</p>
<p>But to the man who is already as uneasy as St. Lawrence on his silver grill, 
  who feels the spirit stir in him, even as a woman feels, and sickens at, the 
  first leap of the babe in her womb, to him I bring the splendid vision, the 
  perfume and the glory, the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. 
  And to whosoever hath attained that height will I put a further Question, announce 
  a further Glory. </p>
<p>It is my misfortune and not my fault that I am bound to deliver this elementary 
  Message. </p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;Man has two sides; one to face the world with, 
    <p>One to show a woman when he loves her.&quot; </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>We must pardon Browning his bawdy jest; for his truth is ower true! But it 
  is your own fault if you are the world instead of the beloved; and only see 
  of me what Moses saw of God! </p>
<p>It is disgusting to have to spend one's life jetting dirt in the face of the 
  British public in the hope that in washing it they may wash off the acrid grease 
  of their commercialism, the saline streaks of their hypocritical tears, the 
  putrid perspiration of their morality, the dribbling slobber of their sentimentality 
  and their religion. And they don't wash it! ... </p>
<p>But let us take a less unpleasing metaphor, the whip! As some schoolboy poet 
  repeatedly wrote, his rimes as poor as Edwin Arnold, his metre as erratic and 
  as good as Francis Thompson, his good sense and frank indecency a match for 
  Browning! </p>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;Can't be helped; must be done --- 
    <p>So ...&quot; </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Nay! 'tis a bad, bad rime. </p>
<p>And only after the scourge that smites shall come the rod that consoles, if 
  I may borrow a somewhat daring simile from Abdullah Haji of Shiraz and the twenty-third 
  Psalm. </p>
<p>Well, I would much prefer to spend my life at the rod; it is wearisome and 
  loathsome to be constantly flogging the tough hide of Britons, whom after all 
  I love. &quot;Whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son that 
  He receiveth.&quot; I shall really be glad if a few of you will get it over, 
  and come and sit on daddy's knee! </p>
<p>The first step is the hardest; make a start, and I will soon set the hunchback 
  lion and the soldier unicorn fighting for your crown. And they shall lie down 
  together at the end, equally glad, equally weary; while sole and sublime that 
  crown of thine (brother!) shall glitter in the frosty Void of the abyss, its 
  twelve stars filling that silence and solitude with a music and a motion that 
  are more silent and more still than they; thou shalt sit throned on the Invisible, 
  thine eyes fixed upon That which we call Nothing, because it is beyond Everything 
  attainable by thought, or trance, thy right hand gripping the azure rod of Light, 
  thy left hand clasped upon the scarlet scourge of Death; thy body girdled with 
  a snake more brilliant than the sun, its name Eternity; thy mouth curved moonlike 
  in a smile, in the invisible kiss of Nuit, our Lady of the Starry Abodes; thy 
  body's electric flesh stilled by sheer might to a movement closed upon itself 
  in the controlled fury of Her love --- nay, beyond all these Images art thou 
  (little brother!) who art passed from I and Thou, and He unto That which hath 
  no Name, no Image. ... </p>
<p>Little brother, give me thy hand; for the first step is hard. </p>
<p>ALEISTER CROWLEY.</p>
