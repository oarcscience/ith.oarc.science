<h2 align="center">AN ACCOUNT OF A.<strong>·</strong>. A.<strong>·</strong>.</h2>
<p>IT is necessary, my dear brothers, to give you a clear idea of the interior 
  Order; of that illuminated community which is scattered throughout the world, 
  but which is governed by one truth and united in one spirit.</p>
<p>This community possesses a School, in which all who thirst for knowledge are 
  instructed by the Spirit of Wisdom itself; and all the mysteries of nature are 
  preserved in this school for the children of light. Perfect knowledge of nature 
  and of humanity is taught in this school. It is from her that all truths penetrate 
  into the world; she is the school of all who search for wisdom, and it is in 
  this community alone that truth and the explantation of all mystery are to be 
  found. It is the most hidden of communities, yet it contains members from many 
  circles; nor is there any Centre of Thought whose activity is not due to the 
  presence of one of ourselves. From all time there has been an exterior school 
  based on the interior one, of which it is but the outer expression. From all 
  time, therefore, there has been a hidden assembly, a society of the Elect, of 
  those who sought for and had capacity for light, and this interior society was 
  the Axle of the R.O.T.A. All that any external order possesses in symbol, ceremony, 
  or rite is the letter expressive outwardly of that spirit of truth which dwelleth 
  in the interior Sanctuary. Nor is the contradiction of the exterior any bar 
  to the harmony of the interior.</p>
<p>Hence this Sanctuary, composed of members widely scattered indeed but united 
  by the bonds of perfect love, has been occupied from the earliest ages in building 
  the grand Temple (through the evolution of humanity) by which the reign of L.V.X. 
  will be manifest. This society is in the communion of those who have most capacity 
  for light; they are united in truth, and their Chief is the Light of the World 
  himself, V.V.V.V.V., the One Anointed in Light, the single teacher for the human 
  race, the Way, the Truth, and the Life.</p>
<p>The interior Order was formed immediately after the first perception of man's 
  wider heritage had dawned upon the first of the adepts; it received from the 
  Masters at first-hand the revelation of the means by which humanity could be 
  raised to its rights and delivered from its misery. It received the primitive 
  charge of all revelation and mystery; it received the key of true science, both 
  divine and natural.</p>
<p>But as men multiplied, the frailty of man necessitated an exterior society 
  which veiled the interior one, and concealed the spirit and the truth in the 
  letter, because many people were not capable of comprehending great interior 
  truth. Therefore, interior truths were wrapped in external and perceptible ceremonies, 
  so that men, by the perception of the outer which is the symbol of the interior, 
  might by degrees be enabled safely to approach the interior spiritual truths.</p>
<p>But the inner truth has always been confided to him who in his day had the 
  most capacity for illumination, and he became the sole guardian of the original 
  Trust, as High Priest of the Sanctuary.</p>
<p>When it became necessary that interior truths should be enfolded in exterior 
  ceremony and symbol, on account of the real weakness of men who were not capable 
  of hearing the Light of Light, then exterior worship began. It was, however, 
  always the type or symbol of the interior, that is to say, the symbol of the 
  true and Secret Sacrament.</p>
<p>The external worship would never have been separated from interior revel but 
  for the weakness of man, which tends too easily to forget the spirit in the 
  letter; but the Masters are vigilant to note in every nation those who are able 
  to receive light, and such persons are employed as agents to spread the light 
  according to man's capacity and to revivify the dead letter.</p>
<p>Through these instruments the interior truths of the Sanctuary were taken into 
  every nation, and modified symbolically according to their customs, capacity 
  for instruction, climate, and receptiveness. So that the external types of every 
  religion, worship, ceremonies and Sacred Books in general have more or less 
  clearly, as their object of instruction, the interior truths of the Sanctuary, 
  by which man will be conducted to the universal knowledge of the one Absolute 
  Truth.</p>
<p>The more the external worship of a people has remained united with the spirit 
  of esoteric truth, the purer its religion; but the wider the difference between 
  the symbolic letter and the invisible truth, the more imperfect has become the 
  religion. Finally, it may be, the external form has entirely parted from its 
  inner truth, so that ceremonial observances without soul or life have remained 
  alone.</p>
<p>In the midst of all this, truth reposes inviolable in the inner Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Faithful to the spirit of truth, the members of the interior Order live in 
  silence, but in real activity.</p>
<p>Yet, besides their secret holy work, they have from time to time decided upon 
  political strategic action.</p>
<p>Thus, when the earth was night utterly corrupt by reason of the Great Sorcery, 
  the Brethren sent Mohammed to bring freedom to mankind by the sword.</p>
<p>This being but partially a success, they raised up one Luther to teach freedom 
  of thought. Yet this freedom soon turned into a heavier bondage than before.</p>
<p>Then the Brethren delivered unto man the knowledge of nature, and the keys 
  thereof; yet this also was prevented by the Great Sorcery.</p>
<p>Now then finally in nameless ways, as one of our Brethren hath it now in mind 
  to declare, have they raised up One to deliver unto men the keys of Spiritual 
  Knowledge, and by His work shall He be judged.</p>
<p>This interior community of light is the reunion of all those capable of receiving 
  light, and it is known as the Communion of Saints, the primitive receptacle 
  for all strength and truth, confided to it from all time.</p>
<p>By it the agents of L.V.X. were formed in every age, passing from the interior 
  to the exterior, and communicating spiritand life to the dead letter, as already 
  said.</p>
<p>This illuminated community is the true school of L.V.X.; it has its Chair, 
  its Doctors; it possesses a rule for students; it has forms and objects for 
  study.</p>
<p>It has also its degrees for successive develoÿment to greater altitudes.</p>
<p>This school of wisdom has been for ever most secretly hidden from the world, 
  because it is invisible and submissive solely to illuminated government.</p>
<p>It has never been exposed to the accidents of time and to the weakness of man, 
  because only the most capable were chosen for it, and those who selected made 
  no error.</p>
<p>Through this school were developed the germs of all the sublime sciences, which 
  were first received by external schools, then clothed in other forms, and hence 
  degenerated.</p>
<p>According to time and circumstances, the society of sages communicated unto 
  the exterior societies their symbolic hieroglyphs, in order to attract man to 
  the great truths of their Sanctuary.</p>
<p>But all exterior societies subsist only by virtue of this interior one. As 
  soon as external societies wish to transform a temple of wisdom into a political 
  edifice, the interior society retires and leaves only the letter without the 
  spirit. It is thus that secret external societies of wisdom were nothing but 
  hieroglyphic screens, the truth remaining inviolable in the Sanctuary so that 
  she might never be profaned.</p>
<p>In this interior society man finds wisdom and with her All--- not the wisdom 
  of this world, which is but scientific knowledge, which revolves round the outside 
  but never touches the centre (in which is contained all strength), but true 
  wisdom, understanding and knowledge, reflections of the supreme illumination.</p>
<p>All disputes, all controversies, all the things belonging to the false cares 
  of this world, fruitless discussions, useless germs of opinions which spread 
  the seeds of disunion, all error, schisms, and systems are banished. Neither 
  calumny nor scandal is known. Every man is honoured. Love alone reigns.</p>
<p>We must not, however, imagine that this society resembles any secret society, 
  meeting at certain times, choosing leaders and members, united by special objects. 
  All societies, be what they may, can but come after this interior illuminated 
  circle. This society knows none of the formalities which belong to the outer 
  rings, the work of man. In this kingdom of power all outward forms cease.</p>
<p>L.V.X. is the Power always present. The greatest man of his times, the chief 
  himself, does not always know all the members, but the moment when it is necessary 
  that he should accomplish any object he finds them in the world with certainty 
  ready to his hand.</p>
<p>This community has no outside barriers. He who may be chosen is as the first; 
  he presents himself among the others without presumption, and he is received 
  by the others without jealousy.</p>
<p>If it be necessary that real members should meet together, they find and recognize 
  each other with perfect certainty.</p>
<p>No disguise can be used, neither hypocrisy nor dissimulation could hide the 
  characteristic qualities which distinguish the members of this society. All 
  illusion is gone, and things appear in their true form.</p>
<p>No one member can choose another; unanimous choice is required. Though not 
  all men are called, many of called are chosen, and that as soon as they become 
  fit for entrance.</p>
<p>Any man can look for the entrance, and any man who is within can teach another 
  to seek for it; but only he who is fit can arrive within.</p>
<p>Unprepared men occasion disorder in a community, and disorder is not compatible 
  with the Sanctuary. Thus it is impossible to profane the Sanctuary, since admission 
  is not formal but real.</p>
<p>Worldly intelligence seeks this Sanctuary in vain; fruitless also will be the 
  efforts of malice to penetrate these great mysteries; all is indecipherable 
  to him who is not ripe; he can see nothing, read nothing in the interior.</p>
<p>He who is fit is joined to the chain, perhaps often where he though least likely, 
  and at a point of which he knew nothing himself.</p>
<p>To become fit should be the sole effort of him who seeks wisdom.</p>
<p>But there are methods by which fitness is attained, for in this holy communion 
  is the primitive storehouse of the most ancient and original science of the 
  human race, with the primitive mysteries also of all science. It is the unique 
  and really illuminated community which is absolutely in possession of the key 
  to all mystery, which knows the centre and source of all nature. It is a society 
  which unites superior strength to its own, and counts its members from more 
  than one world. It is the society whose members form the republic of Genius, 
  the Regent Mother of the whole World.</p>
