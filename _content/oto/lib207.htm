                           INSTRUCTIONS OF A.'. A.'.

                          A SYLLABUS OF THE OFFICIAL







                           INSTRUCTIONS OF A.'. A.'.







                              HITHERTO PUBLISHED











   THE publications of the A.'. A.'. divide themselves into four classes.



   Class &quot;A&quot; consists of books of which may be changed not so much as the style of a letter: that is, they represent the utterance of an Adept entirely beyond the criticism of even the Visible Head of the Organization.



   Class &quot;B&quot; consists of books or essays which are the result of ordinary scholarship, enlightened and earnest.



   Class &quot;C&quot; consists of matter which is to be regarded rather as suggestive than anything else.



   Class &quot;D&quot; consists of the Official Rituals and Instructions.



   Some publications are composite, and pertain to more than one class.







                            CLASS &quot;A&quot; PUBLICATIONS







   LIBER I. --- &quot;Liber V Vel Magi.&quot;



   This is an account of the Grade of Magus, the highest grade which it is ever possible to manifest in any way whatever upon this plane.  Or so it is said by the Masters of the Temple. {43}







   LIBER VII. --- &quot;Liber Liberi Vel Lapidis Lazvli, Advmbratio Kabbalae AEgyptiorvm Svb Figvra VII,&quot; being the Voluntary Emancipation of a certain Exempt Adept from his Adeptship.  These are the Birth Words of a Master of the Temple.



   The nature of this book is sufficiently explained by its title.  Its seven chapters are referred to the seven planets in the following order: Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, Sol, Mercury, Luna, Venus.







   LIBER X. &quot;Liber Porta Lucis.&quot;

   LIBER LXV. --- &quot;Liber Cordis cincti serpente.&quot;



   An account of the relations of the Aspirant with his Holy Guardian Angel. This book is given to Probationers, as the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel is the Crown of the Outer College. Similarly Liber VII is given to Neophytes, as the grade of Master of the Temple is the next resting-place, and Liber CCXX to Zelator, since that carries him to the highest of all possible grades.  Liber XXVII is given to the Practicus, as in this book is the ultimate foundation of the highest theoretical Qabalah, and Liber DCCCXIII to the Philosophus, as it is the foundation of the highest practical Qabalah.







   LIBER LXVI. --- &quot;Liber Stellae Rubeae.&quot;  A secret ritual, the Heart of IAO- OAI, delivered unto V.V.V.V.V. for his use {44} in a certain matter of &quot;Liber Legis,&quot; and written down under the figure LXVI.



   This book is sufficiently described by the title.







   LIBER XC. --- &quot;Liber TZADDI Vel Hamus Hermeticus Sub Figura XC.&quot;



   An account of Initiation, and an indication as to those who are suitable for the same.







   LIBER CLVI. --- &quot;Liber Cheth Vel Vallum Abiegni Sub Figura CLVI.&quot;



   This book is a perfect account of the task of the Exempt Adept, considered under the symbols of a particular plane, not the intellectual.







   LIBER CCXX. --- &quot;Liber L. Vel Legis Sub Figura CCXX as delivered by LXXVIII unto DCLXVI.&quot;



   This book is the foundation of the New AEon, and thus of the whole of our Work.

   &quot;Liber CCCCXVIII. --- Liber XXX AERVM Vel Saeculi.&quot;  Being of the Angels of the thirty AETHYRS, the Vision and the Voice.



   Besides being the classical account of the thirty AEthyrs and a model of all visions, the cries of the Angels should be regarded as accurate, and the doctrine of the function of the Great White Brotherhood understood as the foundation of the Aspiration of the Adept.  The account of the Master of the Temple should in particular be taken as authentic.



   The instruction in the 8th AEthyr pertains to Class D, &quot;i.e.&quot; it is an Official Ritual, and the same remarks apply to the account of the proper method of invoking AEthyrs given in the 18th AEthyr.
