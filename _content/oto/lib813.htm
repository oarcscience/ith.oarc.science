  (1)In Hebrew, ADNI, 65. The Gnostic Initiates transliterated it to imply their 
  own secret formulae; we follow so excellent an example. ON is an Arcanum of 
  Arcana; its significance is taught, gradually, in the O.T.O. Also AD is the 
  paternal formula, Hadit; ON is its complement NUIT; the final Yod signifies 
  "mine" etymologically and essentially the Mercurial (transmitted) hermaphroditic 
  virginal seed - The Hermit of the Taro - The use of the name is therefore to 
  invoke one's own inmost secrecy, considered as the result of the conjunction 
  of Nuit and Hadit. If the second A is included, its import is to affirm the 
  operation of the Holy Ghost and the formulation of the Babe in the Egg, which 
  precedes the appearance of the Hermit.<BR>
  (2)A thorough comprehension of Psycho-analysis will contribute notably to the 
  proper appreciation of this Ritual.<BR>
  (3)It is said among men that the word Hell deriveth from the word "helan", to 
  hele or conceal, in the tongue of the Anglo-Saxons. That is, it is the concealed 
  place, which since all things are in thine own self, is the unconscious, <EM>Liber

  through projection in conditioned Form) three pairs of opposites: (a) The Fixed 
  and the Volatile; (b) The Unmanifested and the Manifest; and (c) the Unmoved 
  and the Moved. Otherwise, the Negative and the Positive in respect of Matter, 
  Mind and Motion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Line 5 
<BLOCKQUOTE>He acclaims his Angel as "Himself Made Perfect"; adding that this 
  Individuality is inscrutable in inviolable. In the Neophyte Ritual of G: D: 
  (As it is printed in Equinox I, II, for the old aeon) the Hierophant is the 
  perfected Osiris, who brings the candidate, the natural Osiris, to identity 
  with himself. But in the new Aeon the Hierophant is Horus (Liber CCXX, I, 49) 
  therefore the Candidate will be Horus too. What then is the formula of the initiation 
  of Horus? It will no longer be that of the Man, through Death. It will be the 
  natural growth of the Child. His experiences will no more be regarded as catastrophic. 
  Their hieroglyph is the Fool: the innocent and impotent Harpocrates Babe becomes 
  the Horus Adult by obtaining the Wand. "Der reine Thor" seizes the Sacred Lance. 
  Bacchus becomes Pan. The Holy Guardian Angel is the Unconscious Creature Self 
  - the Spiritual Phallus. His knowledge and conversation contributes occult puberty. 
  It is therefore advisable to replace the name Asar-Un-Nefer by that of Ra-Hoor-Khuit 
  at the outset, and by that of one's own Holy Guardian Angel when it has been 
  communicated.</BLOCKQUOTE>

  existence through the Sacrament of dividual "Life" (Bread - the flesh of BESZ) 
  and "Love" (Wine - the blood or venom of AOPHRASZ).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>He acclaims His Angel as having "eaten of the Fruit of the Tree of

  apply Himself accurately to His self-appointed environment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Line 9 
<BLOCKQUOTE>He acclaims His Angel as having laid down the Law of Love as the Magical 
  formula of the Universe, that He may resolve the phenomenal again into its noumenal 
  phase by uniting any two opposites in ecstasic passion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Line 10 
<BLOCKQUOTE>He acclaims His Angel as having appointed that this formula of Love 
  should effect not only the dissolution of the separateness of the Lovers into 
  His own impersonal Godhead, but their co-ordination in a "Child" quintessentialized 
  from its parents to constitute a higher order of Being than theirs, so that 
  each generation is an alchemical progress towards perfection in the direction 
  of successive complexities. As Line 9 asserts Involution, Line 10 asserts Evolution.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Line 11 
<BLOCKQUOTE>He acclaims His Angel as having devised this method of self-realization;

<P>Line 1 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Adept asserts his right to enter into conscious communication 
  with His Angel, on the ground that that Angel has Himself taught him the Secret 
  Magick by which he may make the proper link. "Mosheh" is M H, the formation 
  in Jechidah, Chiah, Neshamah, Ruach, - The Sephiroth from Kether to Yesod - 
  since 45 is Sum 1-9 while Sh, 300, is Sum 1-24, which superadds to these Nine 
  an extra Fifteen numbers. (See in Liber D, the meanings and correspondences 
  of 9, 15, 24, 45, 300, 345.) 45 is moreover A D M, MDA, man. "Mosheh" is thus 
  the name of man as a God-concealing form. But in the Ritual let the Adept replace 
  this "Mosheh" by his own motto as Adeptus Minor. For "Ishrael" let him prefer 
  his own Magical Race, according to the obligations of his Oaths to Our Holy 
  Order! (The Beast 666 Himself used "Ankh-f-n-Khonsu" and "Khem" in this section.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Line 2 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Adept reminds his Angel that He has created That One Substance 
  of which Hermes hath written in the Table of Emerald, whose virtue is to unite 
  in itself all opposite modes of Being, thereby to serve as a Talisman charged 
  with the Spiritual Energy of Existence, an Elixir or Stone composed of the physical 
  basis of Life. This Commemoration is placed between the two personal appeals 
  to the Angel, as if to claim privilege to partake of this Eucharist which createth, 
  sustaineth and redeemeth all things.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Line 3 
<BLOCKQUOTE>He now asserts that he is himself the "Angel" or messenger of his 
  Angel; that is, that he is a mind and body whose office is to receive and transmit 
  the Word of his Angel. He hails his Angel not only as "un-nefer" the Perfection 
  of "Asar" himself as a man, but as Ptah-Apophrasz-Ra, the identity (Hadit) wrapped 
  in the Dragon (Nuit) and thereby manifested as a Sun (Ra-Hoor-Khuit). The "Egg" 
  (or Heart) "girt with a Serpent" is a cognate symbol; the idea is thus expressed 
  later in the ritual. (See Liber LXV which expands this to the uttermost.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<U> 
<P>Section B 
</U> 
<P>The Adept passes from contemplation to action in the sections now following 
  B to Gg. He is to travel astrally around the circle, making the appropriate 
  pentagrams, sigils, and signs. His direction is widdershins. He thus makes three 
  curves, each covering three-fourths of the circle. He should give the sign of 
  the Enterer on passing the Kiblah, or Direction of Boleskine. This picks up 
  the force naturally radiating from that point (1) and projects it in the direction 
  of the path of the Magician. The sigils are those given in the Equinox Vol. 
  I, No. 7, Plate X outside the square; the signs those shewn in Vol. I, No. 2, 
  Plate "The Signs of the Grades". In these invocations he should expand his girth 
  and his stature to the utmost (2), assuming the form and the consciousness of 
  the elemental god of the quarter. After this, he begins to vibrate the "Barbarous 
  Names" of the Ritual. 
<P>Now let him not only fill his whole being to the uttermost with the force of 
  the Names; but let him formulate his Will, understood thoroughly as the dynamic 
  aspect of his Creative Self, in an appearance symbolically apt, I say not in 
  the form of a Ray of Light, of a Fiery Sword, or of aught save that bodily Vehicle 
  of the Holy Ghost which is sacred to BAPHOMET, by its virtue that concealeth 
  the Lion and the Serpent that His Image may appear adorably upon the Earth for 
  ever. 
<P>Let then the Adept extend his Will beyond the Circle in this imagined Shape 
  and let it radiate with the Light proper to the element invoked, and let each 
  Word issue along the Shaft with passionate impulse, as if its voice gave command 
  thereto that it should thrust itself leapingly forward. Let also each Word accumulate 
  authority, so that the Head of the Shaft may plunge twice as far for the Second 
  Word as for the First, and Four Times for the Third as the Second, and thus 
  to the end. Moreover, let the Adept fling forth his whole consciousness thither. 
  Then at the final Word, let him bring rushing back his Will within himself, 
  steadily streaming, and let him offer himself to its point, as Artemis to PAN, 
  that this perfectly pure concentration of the Element purge him thoroughly, 
  and possess him with its passion. 
<P>In this Sacrament being wholly at one with that Element, let the Adept utter 
  the Charge "Hear me, and make", etc. with strong sense that this unity with 
  that quarter of the Universe confers upon him the fullest freedom and privilege 
  appurtenant thereto. 
<P>Let the Adept take note of the wording of the Charge. The "Firmament" is the 
  Ruach, the "mental plane"; it is the realm of Shu, or Zeus, where revolves the 
  Wheel of the Gunas, the Three forms (3) of Being. The Aethyr is the "akasha", 
  the "Spirit", the Aethyr or physics, which is the framework on which all forms 
  are founded; it receives, records and transmits all impulses without itself 
  suffering mutation thereby. The "Earth" is the sphere wherein the operation 
  of these "fundamental" and aethyric forces appears to perception. "Under the 
  Earth" is the world of those phenomena which inform those perceived projections, 
  and determine their particular character. "Dry land" is the place of dead "material 
  things", dry (i.e. unknowable) because unable to act on our minds. "Water" is 
  the vehicle whereby we feel such things; "air" their menstruum wherein these 
  feelings are mentally apprehended. It is called "whirling" because of the instability 
  of thought, and the fatuity of reason, on which we are yet dependent for what 
  we call "life". "Rushing Fire" is the world in which wandering thought burns 
  up to swift-darting Will. These four stages explain how the non-Ego is transmuted 
  into the Ego. A "Spell" of God is any form of consciousness, and a "Scourge" 
  any form of action. 
<P>The Charge, as a whole, demands for the Adept the control of every detail of 
  the Universe which His Angel has created as a means of manifesting Himself to 
  Himself. It covers command of the primary projection of the Possible in individuality, 
  in the antithetical artifice which is the device of Mind, and in a balanced 
  triplicity of modes or states of being whose combinations constitute the characteristics 
  of Cosmos. It includes also a standard of structure, a rigidity to make reference 
  possible. Upon these foundations of condition which are not things in themselves, 
  but the canon to which things conform, is builded the Temple of Being, whose 
  materials are themselves perfectly mysterious, inscrutable as the Soul, and 
  like the Soul imagining themselves by symbols which we may feel, perceive, and 
  adapt to our use without ever knowing the whole Truth about them. The Adept 
  sums up all these items by claiming authority over every form of expression 
  possible to Existence, whether it be a "spell" (idea) or a "scourge" (act) of 
  "God", that is, of himself. The Adept must accept every "spirit", every "spell", 
  every "scourge", as part of his environment, and make them all "subject to" 
  himself; that is, consider them as contributory causes of himself. They have 
  made him what he is. They correspond exactly to his own faculties. They are 
  all - ultimately - of equal importance. The fact that he is what he is proves 
  that each item is equilibrated. The impact of each new impression affects the 
  entire system in due measure. He must therefore realize that every event is 
  subject to him. It occurs because he had need of it. Iron rusts because the 
  molecules demand oxygen for the satisfaction of their tendencies. They do not 
  crave hydrogen; therefore combination with that gas is an event which does not 
  happen. All experiences contribute to make us complete in ourselves. We feel 
  ourselves subject to them so long as we fail to recognise this; when we do, 
  we perceive that they are subject to us. And whenever we strive to evade an 
  experience, whatever it may be, we thereby do wrong to ourselves. We thwart 
  our own tendencies. To live is to change; and to oppose change is to revolt 
  against the law which we have enacted to govern our lives. To resent destiny 
  is thus to abdicate our sovereignty, and to invoke death. Indeed, we have decreed 
  the doom of death for every breach of the law of Life. And every failure to 
  incorporate any impression starves that particular faculty which stood in need 
  of it.

  (3)They correspond to the Sulphur, Mercury, and Salt of Alchemy; to Sattvas, 
  Rajas, and Tamas in the Hindu system; and are rather modes of action than actual 
  qualities even when conceived as latent. They are the apparatus of communication 
  between the planes; as such, they are conventions. There is no absolute validity 
  in any means of mental apprehension; but unless we make these spirits of the 
  Firmament subject unto us by establishing right relation (within the possible 
  limits) with the Universe, we shall fall into error when we develop our new 
  instrument of direct understanding. It is vital that the Adept should train 
  his intellectual faculties to tell him the truth, in the measure of their capacity. 
  To despise the mind on account of its limitations is the most disastrous blunder; 
  it is the common cause of the calamities which strew so many shores with the 
  wreckage of the Mystic Armada. Bigotry, Arrogance, Bewilderment, all forms of 
  mental and moral disorder, so often observed in people of great spiritual attainment, 
  have brought the Path itself into discredit; almost all such catastrophes are 
  due to trying to build the Temple of the Spirit without proper attention to 
  the mental laws of structure and the physical necessities of foundation. The 
  mind must be brought to its utmost pitch of perfection, but according to its 
  own internal properties; one cannot feed a microscope on mutton chops. It must 
  be regarded as a mechanical instrument of knowledge, independent of the personality 
  of its possessor. One must treat it exactly as one treats one's electroscope 
  or one's eyes; one influence of one's wishes. A physician calls in a colleague 
  to attend to his own family, knowing that personal anxiety may derange his judgment. 
  A microscopist who trusts his eyes when his pet theory is at stake may falsify 
  the facts, and find too late that he has made a fool of himself.<BR>
  In the case of initiations itself, history is scarred with the wounds inflicted 
  by this Dagger. It reminds us constantly of the danger of relying upon the intellectual 
  faculties. A judge must know the law in every point, and be detached from personal 
  prejudices, and incorruptible, or iniquity will triumph. Dogma, with persecution, 
  delusion, paralysis of progress, and many another evil, as its satraps, has 
  always established a tyranny when Genius has proclaimed it. Islam making a bonfire 
  of written Wisdom, and Haeckel forging biological evidence; physicists ignorant 
  of radioactivity disputing the conclusions of geology, and theologians impatient 
  of truth struggling against the tide of thought; all such must perish at the 
  hands of their own error in making their minds, internally defective or externally 
  deflected, the measure of the Universe.<BR>

<U>Section E</U> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>He goes to the North to invoke Earth; flowers of green flame flash 
  from his weapon. As practice makes the Adept perfect in this Work, it becomes 
  automatic to attach all these complicated ideas and intentions to their correlated 
  words and acts. When this is attained he may go deeper into the formula by amplifying 
  its correspondences. Thus, he may invoke water in the manner of water, extending 
  his will with majestic and irresistible motion, mindful of its impulse gravitation, 
  yet with a suave and tranquil appearance of weakness. Again, he may apply the 
  formula of water to its peculiar purpose as it surges back into his sphere, 
  using it with conscious skill for the cleansing and calming of the receptive 
  and emotional elements in his character, and for the solution or sweeping away 
  of those tangled weeds of prejudice which hamper him from freedom to act as 
  he will. Similar applications of the remaining invocations will occur to the 
  Adept who is ready to use them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<U>Section F</U> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Adept now returns to the Tiphereth square of his Tau, and invokes 
  spirit, facing toward Boleskine, by the active Pentagrams, the sigil called 
  the Mark of the Beast, and the Signs of L.V.X. (See plate as before). He then 
  vibrates the Names extending his will in the same way as before, but vertically 
  upward. At the same time he expands the Source of that Will - the secret symbol 
  of Self - both about him and below, as if to affirm that Self, duplex as is 
  its form, reluctant to acquiesce in its failure to coincide with the Sphere 
  of Nuith. Let him now imagine, at the last Word, that the Head of his will, 
  where his consciousness is fixed, opens its fissure (the Brahmarandra-Cakkra, 
  at the junction of the cranial sutures) and exudes a drop of clear crystalline 
  dew, and that this pearl is his Soul, a virgin offering to his Angel, pressed 
  forth from his being by the intensity of this Aspiration.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<U>Section Ff</U> 
<P>With these words the Adept does not withdraw his will within him as in the 
  previous Sections. He thinks of them as a reflection of Truth on the surface 
  of the dew, where his Soul hides trembling. He takes them to be the first formulation 
  in his consciousness of the nature of His Holy Guardian Angel. 
<P>Line 1<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The "Gods" include all the conscious elements of his nature.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Line 3<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The "Winds" are his thoughts, which have prevented him from attaining 
  to his Angel.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Line 4<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>His Angel has made "Voice", the magical weapon which produces "Words", 
  and these words have been the wisdom by which He hath created all things. The 
  "Voice" is necessary as the link between the Adept and his Angel. The Angel 
  is "King", the One who "can", the "source of authority and the fount of honour"; 
  also the King (or King's Son) who delivers the Enchanted Princess, and makes 
  her his Queen. He is "Ruler", the "unconscious Will"; to be thwarted no more 
  by the ignorant and capricious false will of the conscious man. And He is "Helper", 
  the author of the infallible impulse that sends the Soul sweeping along the 
  skies on its proper path with such impetus that the attraction of alien orbs 
  is no longer sufficient to swerve it. The "Hear me" clause is now uttered by 
  the normal human consciousness, withdrawn to the physical body; the Adept must 
  deliberately abandon his attainment, because it is not yet his whole being which 
  burns up before the Beloved.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<U>Section G</U> 
<P>The Adept, though withdrawn, shall have maintained the Extension of his Symbol. 
  He now repeats the signs as before, save that he makes the Passive Invoking 
  Pentagram of Spirit. He concentrates his consciousness within his Twin-Symbol 
  of Self, and endeavours to send it to sleep. But if the operation be performed 
  properly, his Angel shall have accepted the offering of Dew, and seized with 
  fervour upon the extended symbol of Will towards Himself. This then shall He 
  shake vehemently with vibrations of love reverberating with the Words of the 
  Section. Even in the physical ears of the adept there shall resound an echo 
  thereof, yet he shall not be able to describe it. It shall seem both louder 
  than thunder, and softer than the whisper of the night-wind. It shall at once 
  be inarticulate, and mean more than he hath ever heard.<BR>
  <BR>
  Now let him strive with all the strength of his Soul to withstand the Will of 
  his Angel, concealing himself in the closest cell of the citadel of consciousness. 
  Let him consecrate himself to resist the assault of the Voice and the Vibration 
  until his consciousness faint away into Nothing. For if there abide unabsorbed 
  even one single atom of the false Ego, that atom should stain the virginity 
  of the True Self and profane the Oath; then that atom should be so inflamed 
  by the approach of the Angel that is should overwhelm the rest of the mind, 
  tyrannize over it, and become an insane despot to the total ruin of the realm.<BR>
  <BR>
  But, all being dead to sense, who then is able to strive against the Angel? 
  He shall intensify the stress of His Spirit so that His loyal legions of Lion-Serpents 
  leap from the ambush, awakening the adept to witness their Will and sweep him 
  with them in their enthusiasm, so that he consciously partakes this purpose, 
  and sees in its simplicity the solution of all his perplexities. Thus then shall 
  the Adept be aware that he is being swept away through the column of his Will 
  Symbol. and that His Angel is indeed himself, with intimacy so intense as to 
  become identity, and that not in a single Ego, but in every unconscious element 
  that shares in that manifold uprush.<BR>
  <BR>
  This rapture is accompanied by a tempest of brilliant light, almost always, 
  and also in many cases by an outburst of sound, stupendous and sublime in all 
  cases, though its character may vary within wide limits. (1)<BR>
  <BR>
  The spate of stars shoots from the head of the Will-Symbol, and is scattered 
  over the sky in glittering galaxies. This dispersion destroys the concentration 
  of the adept, whose mind cannot master such multiplicity of majesty; as a rule, 
  he simply sinks stunned into normality, to recall nothing of his experience 
  but a vague though vivid impression of complete release and ineffable rapture. 
  Repetition fortifies him to realise the nature of his attainment; and his Angel, 
  the link once made, frequents him, and trains him subtly to be sensitive to 
  his Holy presence, and persuasion. But it may occur, especially after repeated 
  success, that the Adept is not flung back into his mortality by the explosion 
  of the Star-spate, but identified with one particular "Lion-Serpent", continuing 
  conscious thereof until it finds its proper place in Space, when its secret 
  self flowers forth as a truth, which the Adept may then take back to earth with 
  him.<BR>
  <BR>
  This is but a side issue. The main purpose of the Ritual is to establish the 
  relation of the subconscious self with the Angel in such a way that the Adept 
  is aware that his Angel is the Unity which expresses the sum of the Elements 
  of that Self, that his normal consciousness contains alien enemies introduced 
  by the accidents of environment, and that his Knowledge and Conversation of 
  His Holy Guardian Angel destroys all doubts and delusions, confers all blessings, 
  teaches all truth, and contains all delights. But it is important that the Adept 
  should not rest in mere inexpressible realization of his rapture, but rouse 
  himself to make the relation submit to analysis, to render it in rational terms, 
  and thereby enlighten his mind and heart in a sense as superior to fanatical 
  enthusiasm as Beethoven's music is to West African war-drums.<BR>

<P>The adept should have realised that his Act of Union with the angel implies 
  (1) the death of his old mind save in so far as his unconscious elements preserve 
  its memory when they absorb it, and (2) the death of his unconscious elements 
  themselves. But their death is rather a going forth to renew their life through 
  love. He then, by conscious comprehension of them separately and together, becomes 
  the "Angel" of his Angel, as Hermes is the Word of Zeus, whose own voice is 
  Thunder. Thus in this section the adept utters articulately so far as words 
  may, what his Angel is to Himself. He says this, with his Scin-Laeca wholly 
  withdrawn into his physical body, constraining His Angel to indwell his heart.

<BLOCKQUOTE>"I am He" asserts the destruction of the sense of separateness between

  their own path. "Strong" is G B R, The Magician escorted by the Sun and the

  equally Absolute. He is in Tiphereth, whose office is Redemption, and he deplores 
  the events which have caused the apparent Sorrow from which he has just escaped.

  Thy wand to all Cups, and thy Disk to all Swords, but betray not thine Egg!<BR>
  <BR>
  Moreover also is IAF verily 666 by virtue of Number; and this is a Mystery of 
  Mysteries; Who knoweth it, he is adept of adepts, and Mighty among Magicians!<BR>
  <BR>
  Now this word SABAF, being by number Three score and Ten (2), is a name of Ayin, 
  the Eye, and the Devil our Lord, and the Goat of Mendes. He is the Lord of the 
  Sabbath of the Adepts, and is Satan, therefore also the Sun, whose number of 
  Magick is 666, the seal of His servant the BEAST.<BR>
  <BR>
  But again SA is 61, AIN, the Naught of Nuith; BA means go, for Hadit; and F 
  is their Son the Sun who is Ra-Hoor-Khuit.<BR>
  <BR>
  So then let the Adept set his sigil upon all the words he hath writ in the Book 
  of the Works of his Will.<BR>
  <BR>
  And let him then end all, saying, Such are the Words! (3) For by this he maketh 
  proclamation before all them that be about his Circle that these Words are true 
  and puissant, binding what he would bind, and loosing what he would loose.<BR>
  <BR>
  Let the Adept perform this Ritual aright, perfect in every part thereof, once 
  daily for one moon, then twice, at dawn and dusk, for two moons, next, thrice, 
  noon added, for three moons, afterwards, midnight making up his course, for 
  four moons four times every day. Then let the Eleventh Moon be consecrated wholly 
  to this Work; let him be instant in continual ardour, dismissing all but his 
  sheer needs to eat and sleep. (4) For know that the true Formula (5) whose virtue 
  sufficed the Beast in this Attainment, was thus:<BR>
  <BR>
  <CENTER>
    INVOKE OFTEN (6)<BR>
    <BR>
  </CENTER>
  So may all men come at last to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian 
  Angel: thus sayeth the Beast, and prayeth His own Angel that this book be as 
  a burning Lamp, and as a living Spring, for Light and Life to them that read 
  therein.<BR>

  (1)If we adopt the new orthography VIAOV (Book 4 Part III Chap. V.) we must 
  read "The Sun-6-the Son" etc. for "all"; and elaborate this interpretation here 
  given in other ways, accordingly. Thus O (of F) will not be "The Fifteen by 
  function" instead of "Five" etc., and "in act free, firm, aspiring, ecstatic", 
  rather than "gentle" etc. as in the present text.<BR>
  (2)There is an alternative spelling TzBA-F Where the Root, (ABz) "an Host", 
  has the value of 93. The Practicus should revive this Ritual throughout in the 
  Light of his personal researches in the Qabalah, and thus make it his own peculiar 
  property. The spelling here suggested implies that he who utters the Word affirms 
  his allegiance to the symbols 93 and 61 that he is a warrior in the army of 
  Will and of the Sun. 93 is also the number of AIWAZ and 6 of The Beast.<BR>
  (3)The consonants of LOGOS, "Word", add (Hebrew values: sGL) to 93. And EPH, 
  "Words", (whence "Epic") has also that value: EIDE TA EPH might be the phrase 
  here intended: its number is 418. This would then assert the accomplishment 
  of the Great Work; this is the natural conclusion of the Ritual. Cf. CCXX. III. 
  75.<BR>
  (4)These needs are modified during the process of Initiation both as to quantity 
  and quality. One should not become anxious about one's physical or mental health 
  on a priori grounds, but pay attention only to indubitable symptoms of distress 
  should such arise.<BR>
  (5)The Oracles of Zoroaster utter this:<BR>
  <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"And when, by often invoking, all the phantasms are vanished, thou 
  shalt see that Holy and Formless Fire, that Fire which darts and flashes through 
  all the Depths of the Universe; hear thou the Voice of the Fire!<BR>
  <BR>
  "A similar Fire flashingly extending through the rushings of Air, or a Fire 
  formless whence cometh the Image of a voice, or even a flashing Light abounding, 
  revolving, whirling forth, crying aloud. Also there is the vision of the fire-flashing 
  Courser of Light, or also a Child, borne aloft on the shoulders of the Celestial 
  Steed, fiery, or clothed with gold, or naked, or shooting with the bow shafts 
  or light, and standing on the shoulders of the horse, then if thy meditation 
  prolongeth itself, thou shalt unite all these symbols into the form of a Lion."<BR>
  <BR>
  This passage - combined with several others - is paraphased in poetry by Aleister 
  Crowley in his <EM>"Tannhauser"</EM>.<BR>
  <BR>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"And when, invoking often, thou shalt see<BR>
    That formless Fire; when all the earth is shaken,<BR>
    The Stars abide not, and the moon is gone,<BR>
    All Time crushed back into Eternity,<BR>
    The Universe by earthquake overtaken; Light is not, and the thunders roll,<BR>
    The World is done:<BR>
    When in the darkness Chaos rolls again<BR>
    In the excited brain:<BR>
    Then, O then call not to thy view that visible<BR>
    Image of Nature; fatal is her name!<BR>
    It fitteth not thy Body to behold<BR>
    That living light of Hell,<BR>
    The unluminous, dead flame,<BR>
    Until that body from the crucible<BR>
    Hath passed, pure gold!<BR>
    For, from the confines of material space,<BR>
    The twilight-moving place,<BR>
    The gates of matter, and the dark threshold,<BR>
    Before the faces of the Things that dwell<BR>
    In the Abodes of Night,<BR>
    Spring into sight<BR>
    Demons, dog-faced, that show no mortal sign<BR>
    Of Truth, but desecrate the Light Divine,<BR>
    Seducing from the sacred mysteries.<BR>
    But, after all these Folk of Fear are driven<BR>
    Before the avenging levin<BR>
    That rives the opening skies,<BR>
    Behold that formless and that Holy Flame<BR>
    That hath no name;<BR>
    The Fire that darts and flashes, writhes and creeps<BR>
    Snake-wise in royal robe<BR>

    Unto that sky beyond the starry deeps,<BR>
    Beyond the Toils of Time, - then formulate<BR>
    In thine own mind, luminous, concentrate,<BR>
    The Lion of the Light, a child that stands<BR>
    On the vast shoulders of the Steed of God:<BR>
    Or winged, or shooting flying shafts, or shod<BR>
    With the flame-sandals.<BR>
    Then, lift up thine hands!<BR>
    Centre thee in thine heart one scarlet thought<BR>
    Limpid with brilliance of the Light above!<BR>

    <BR>
    "The Seeds of Immortality!"</EM> 
  </CENTER>
<P>The Adept who has mastered this Ritual, successfully realising the full import 
  of this controlled rapture, ought not to allow his mind to loosen its grip on 
  the astral imagery of the Star-spate, Will-Symbol, or Soul-symbol, or even to 
  forget its duty to the body and the sensible surroundings. Nor should he omit 
  to keep his Body of Light in close touch with the phenomena of its own plane, 
  so that its privy consciousness may fulfil its proper functions of protecting 
  his scattered ideals from obsession. 
<P>But he should have acquired, by previous practice, the faculty of detaching 
  these elements of his consciousness from their articulate centre, so that they 
  become (temporarily) independent responsible units, capable of receiving communications 
  from headquarters at will, but perfectly able (1) to take care of themselves 
  without troubling their chief, and (2) to report to him at the proper time. 
  In a figure, they must be like subordinate officers, expected to display self-reliance, 
  initiative, and integrity in the execution of the Orders of the Day. 
<P>The Adept should therefore be able to rely on these individual minds of his 
  to control their own conditions without interference from himself for the time 
  required, and to recall them in due course, receiving an accurate report of 
  their adventures. 
<P>This being so, the Adept will be free to concentrate his deepest self, that 
  part of him which unconsciously orders his true Will, upon the realization of 
  his Holy Guardian Angel. The absence of his bodily, mental and astral consciousness 
  is indeed cardinal to success, for it is their usurpation of his attention which 
  has made him deaf to his Soul, and his preoccupation with their affairs that 
  has prevented him from perceiving that Soul. 
<P>The effect of the Ritual has been <BLOCKQUOTE>
<OL TYPE="a">
  <LI>to keep them so busy with their own work that they cease to distract him;<BR>
  <LI>to separate them so completely that his soul is stripped of its sheaths;<BR>
  <LI>to arouse in him an enthusiasm so intense as to intoxicate and anaesthetize 
    him, that he may not feel and resent the agony of this spiritual vivisection, 
    just as bashful lovers get drunk on the wedding night, in order to brazen 
    out the intensity of shame which so mysteriously coexists with their desire;<BR>
  <LI>to concentrate the necessary spiritual forces from every element, and fling 
    them simultaneously into the aspiration towards the Holy Guardian Angel; and<BR>
  <LI>to attract the Angel by the vibration of the magical voice which invokes 
    Him.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  
</OL>
<P>The method of the Ritual is thus manifold. 
<P>There is firstly an analysis of the Adept, which enables him to calculate his 
  course of action. He can decide what must be banished, what purified, what concentrated. 
  He can then concentrate his will upon its one essential element, over-coming 
  its resistance - which is automatic, like a physiological reflex - by destroying 
  inhibitions through his ego-overwhelming enthusiasm. (1) The other half of the 
  work needs no such complex effort; for his Angel is simple and unperplexed, 
  ready at all times to respond to rightly ordered approach. 
<P>It is impossible to overcome one's inhibitions by conscious effort; their existence 
  justifies them. God is on their side, as on that of the victim in Browning's 
  Instans Tyrannus. A man cannot compel himself to love, however much he may want 
  to, on various rational grounds. But on the other hand, when the true impulse 
  comes, it overwhelms all its critics; they are powerless either to make or break 
  a genius; it can only testify to the fact that it has met its master. 
<P>But the results of the Ritual are too various to permit of rigid description. 
  One may say that, presuming the union to be perfect, the Adept need not retain 
  any memory soever of what has occurred. He may be merely aware of a gap in his 
  conscious life, and judge of its contents by observing that his nature has been 
  subtly transfigured. Such an experience might indeed be the proof of perfection. 
<P>If the Adept is to be any wise conscious of his Angel it must be that some 
  part of his mind is prepared to realise the rapture, and to express it to itself 
  in one way or another. This involves the perfection of that part, its freedom 
  from prejudice and the limitations of rationality so-called. For instance: one 
  could not receive the illumination as to the nature of life which the doctrine 
  of evolution should shed, if one is passionately persuaded that humanity is 
  essentially not animal, or convinced that causality is repugnant to reason. 
  The Adept must be ready for the utter destruction of his point of view on any 
  subject, and even that of his innate conception of the forms and laws of thought. 
  (2) Thus he may find that his Angel consider his "business" or his "love" to 
  be absurd trifles; also that human ideas of "time" are invalid, and human "laws" 
  of logic applicable only to the relations between illusions. 
<P>Now the Angel will make contact with the Adept at any point that is sensitive 
  to His influence. Such a point will naturally be one that is salient in the 
  Adept's character, and also one that is, in the proper sense of the word, pure. 
  (3) 
<P>Thus an artist, attuned to appreciate plastic beauty is likely to receive a 
  visual impression of his Angel in a physical form which is sublimely quintessential 
  of his ideal. A musician may be rapt away by majestic melodies such as he never 
  hoped to hear. A philosopher may attain apprehension of tremendous truths, the 
  solution of problems that had baffled him all his life. 
<P>Conformably with this doctrine, we read of illuminations experienced by simple-minded 
  men, such as a workman who "saw God" and likened Him to "a quantity of little 
  pears". Again, we know that ecstasy, impinging upon unbalanced minds, inflames 
  the idolised idea, and produces fanatical faith fierce even to frenzy, with 
  intolerance and insanely disordered energy which is yet so powerful as to effect 
  the destinies of empires. 
<P>But the phenomena of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel 
  are a side issue; the essence of the Union is the intimacy. Their intimacy (or 
  rather identity) is independent of all partial forms of expression; at its best 
  it is therefore as inarticulate as Love. 
<P>The intensity of the consummation will more probably compel a sob or a cry, 
  some natural physical gesture of animal sympathy with the spiritual spasm. This 
  is to be criticised as incomplete self-control. Silence is nobler. 
<P>In any case the Adept must be in communion with his Angel, so that his Soul 
  is suffused with sublimity, whether intelligible or not in terms of intellect. 
  It is evident that the stress of such spiritual possession must tend to overwhelm 
  the soul, especially at first. It actually suffers from the excess of its ecstasy, 
  just as extreme love produces vertigo. The soul sinks and swoons. Such weakness 
  is fatal alike to its enjoyment and its apprehension. "Be strong! then canst 
  thou bear more rapture!" sayeth The Book of the Law. (4) 
<P>The Adept must therefore play the man, arousing himself to harden his soul. 
<P>To this end, I, the Beast, have made trial and proof of divers devices. Of 
  these the most potent is to set the body to strive with the soul. Let the muscles 
  take grip on themselves as if one were wrestling. Let the jaw and mouth, in 
  particular, be tightened to the utmost. Breathe deeply, slowly, yet strongly. 
  Keep mastery over the mind by muttering forcibly and audibly. But lest such 
  muttering tend to disturb communion with the Angel, speak only His Name. Until 
  the Adept have heard that Name, therefore, he may not abide in the perfect possession 
  of his Beloved. His most important task is thus to open his ears to the voice 
  of his Angel, that he may know him, how he is called. For hearken! this Name, 
  understood rightly and fully, declareth the nature of the Angel in every point, 
  wherefore also that Name is the formula of the perfection to which the Adept 
  must aspire, and also of the power of Magick by virtue whereof he must work. 
<P>He then that is as yet ignorant of that Name, let him repeat a word worthy 
  of this particular Ritual. Such are Abrahadabra, the Word of the Aeon, which 
  signifieth "The Great Work accomplished"; and Aumgn interpreted in Part III 
  of Book 4 (5); and the name of THE BEAST, for that His number showeth forth 
  this Union with the Angel, and His Work is no other than to make all men partakers 
  of this Mystery of the Mysteries of Magick. 
<P>So then saying this word or that, let the Adept wrestle with his Angel and 
  withstand Him, that he may constrain Him to consent to continue in communion 
  until the consciousness becomes capable of clear comprehension, and of accurate 
  transmission (6) of the transcendent Truth of the Beloved to the heart that 
  holds him. 
<P>The firm repetition of one of these Words ought to enable the Adept to maintain 
  the state of Union for several minutes, even at first. 
<P>In any case he must rekindle his ardour, esteeming his success rather as an 
  encouragement to more ardent aspiration than as a triumph. He should increase 
  his efforts. 
<P>Let him beware of the "lust of result", of expecting too much, of losing courage 
  if his first success is followed by a series of failures. 
<P>For success makes success seem so incredible that one is apt to create an inhibition 
  fatal to subsequent attempts. One fears to fail; the fear intrudes upon the 
  concentration and so fulfils its own prophecy. We know how too much pleasure 
  in a love affair makes one afraid to disgrace oneself on the next few occasions; 
  indeed, until familiarity has accustomed one to the idea that one's lover has 
  never supposed one to be more than human. Confidence returns gradually. Inarticulate 
  ecstasy is replaced by a more sober enjoyment of the elements of the fascination. 
<P>Just so one's first dazzled delight in a new landscape turns, as one continues 
  to gaze, to the appreciation of exquisite details of the view. At first they 
  were blurred by the blinding rush of general beauty; they emerge one by one 
  as the shock subsides, and passionate rapture yields to intelligent interest. 
<P>In the same way the Adept almost always begins by torrential lyrics painting 
  out mystical extravagances about "ineffable love", "unimaginable bliss", "inexpressible 
  infinities of illimitable utterness". (7) He usually loses his sense of proportion, 
  of humour, of reality, and of sound judgment. His ego is often inflated to the 
  bursting point, till he would be abjectly ridiculous if he were not so pitifully 
  dangerous to himself and others. He also tends to take his new-found "truths 
  of illumination" for the entire body of truth, and insists that they must be 
  as valid an vital for all men as they happen to be for himself. 
<P>It is wise to keep silence about those things "unlawful to utter" which one 
  may have heard "in the seventh heaven". This may not apply to the sixth. 
<P>The Adept must keep himself in hand, however tempted to make a new heaven and 
  a new earth in the next few days by trumpeting his triumphs. He must give time 
  a chance to redress his balance, sore shaken by the impact of the Infinite. 
<P>As he becomes adjusted to intercourse with his Angel, he will find his passionate 
  ecstasy develop a quality of peace and intelligibility which adds power, while 
  it informs and fortifies his mental and moral qualities instead of obscuring 
  and upsetting them. He will by now have become able to converse with his Angel, 
  impossible as it once seemed; for he now knows that the storm of sound which 
  he supposed to be the Voice was only the clamour of his own confusions. The 
  "infinity" nonsense was born of his own inability to think clearly beyond his 
  limits, just as a Bushman, confronted by numbers above five, can only call them 
  "many". 
<P>The truth told by the Angel, immensely as it extends the horizon of the Adept, 
  is perfectly definite and precise. It does not deal in ambiguities and abstractions. 
  It possesses form, and confesses law, in exactly the same way and degree as 
  any other body of truth. It is to the truth of the material and intellectual 
  spheres of man very much what the Mathematics of Philosophy with its "infinite 
  series" and "Cantorian continuity" is to schoolboy arithmetic. Each implies 
  the other, though by that one may explore the essential nature of existence, 
  and by this a pawnbroker's profits. 
<P>This then is the true aim of the Adept in this whole operation, to assimilate 
  himself to his Angel by continual conscious communion. For his Angel is an intelligible 
  image of his own true Will, to do which is the whole of the law of his Being. 
<P>Also the Angel appeareth in Tiphereth, which is the heart of the Ruach, and 
  thus the Centre of Gravity of the Mind. It is also directly inspired from Kether, 
  the ultimate Self, through the Path of the High Priestess, or initiated intuition. 
  Hence the Angel is in truth the Logos or articulate expression of the whole 
  Being of the Adept, so that as he increases in the perfect understanding of 
  His name, he approaches the solution of the ultimate problem, Who he himself 
  truly is. 
<P>Unto this final statement the Adept may trust his Angel to lead him; for the 
  Tiphereth-consciousness alone is connected by paths with the various parts of 
  his mind. (8) None therefore save He hath the knowledge requisite for calculating 
  the combinations of conduct which will organise and equilibrate for forces of 
  the Adept, against the moment when it becomes necessary to confront the Abyss. 
  The Adept must control a compact and coherent mass if he is to make sure of 
  hurling it from him with a clean-cut gesture. 
<P>I, The Beast 666, lift up my voice and swear that I myself have been brought 
  hither by mine Angel. After that I had attained unto the Knowledge and Conversation 
  of Him by virtue of mine ardour towards Him, and of this Ritual that I bestow 
  upon men my fellows, and most of His great Love that He beareth to me, yea, 
  verily, He led me to the Abyss; He bade me fling away all that I had and all 
  that I was; and He forsook me in that Hour. But when I came beyond the Abyss, 
  to be reborn within the womb of BABALON, then came he unto me abiding in my 
  virgin heart, its Lord and Lover! 
<P>Also He made me a Magus, speaking through His Law, the Word of the new Aeon, 
  the Aeon of the Crowned and Conquering Child. (9) Thus he fulfilled my will 
  to bring full freedom to the race of Men. 
<P>Yea, he wrought also in me a Work of wonder beyond this, but in this matter 
  I am sworn to hold my peace.

  (1)A high degree of initiation is required. This means that the process of analysis 
  must have been carried out very thoroughly. The Adept must have become aware 
  of his deepest impulses, and understood their true significance. The "resistance" 
  here mentioned is automatic; it increases indefinitely against direct pressure. 
  It is useless to try to force oneself in these matters; the uninitiated Aspirant, 
  however eager he may be, is sure to fail. One must know how to deal with each 
  internal idea as it arises.<BR>
  (2)Of course, even false tenets and modes of the mind are in one sense true. 
  It is only their appearance which alters. Copernicus did not destroy the facts 
  of nature, or change the instruments of observation. He merely effected a radical 
  simplification of science. Error is really a "fool's knot". Moreover, the very 
  tendency responsible for the entanglement is one of the necessary elements of 
  the situation. Nothing is "wrong" in the end; and one cannot reach the "right" 
  point of view without the aid of one's particular "wrong" point. If we reject 
  or alter the negative of a photograph we shall not get a perfect positive.<BR>
  (3)This means, free from ideas, however excellent in themselves, which are foreign 
  to it. For instance, literary interest has no proper place in a picture.<BR>
  (4)Liber Al vel Legis, II, 61-68, where the details of the proper technique 
  are discussed.<BR>
  (5)The essence of this matter is that the word AUM, which expresses the course 
  of Breath (spiritual life) from free utterance through controlled concentration 
  to Silence, is transmuted by the creation of the compound letter MGN to replace 
  M: that is, Silence is realized as passing into continuous ecstatic vibration, 
  of the nature of "Love" under "Will" as shewn by MGN = 40 + 3 + 50 = 93 AGAPH, 
  ThELHMA etc., and the whole word has the value of 100, Perfection Perfected, 
  the Unity in completion, and equivalent to KR the conjunction of the essential 
  male and female principles.<BR>
  (6)The "normal" intellect is incapable of these functions; a superior faculty 
  must have been developed. As Zoroaster says: "Extend the void mind of thy soul 
  to that Intelligible that thou mayst learn the Intelligible, because it subsisteth 
  beyond Mind. Thou wilt not understand It as when understanding some common thing."<BR>
  (7)This corresponds to the emotional and metaphysical fog which is characteristic 
  of the emergence of thought from homogeneity. The clear and concise differentiation 
  of ideas marks the adult mind.<BR>
  (8)See the maps "Minutum Mundum" in the Equinox I, 1, 2, & 3 and the general 
  relations detailed in Liber 777, of which the most important columns are reprinted 
  in Appendix V.<BR>
  (9)For the account of these matters see The Equinox, Vol. I, "The Temple of 
  Solomon the King", Liber 418, Liber Aleph, "John St. John", "The Urn", and Book 
  4, Part IV.<BR>
