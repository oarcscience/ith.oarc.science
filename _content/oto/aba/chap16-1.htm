<h2 class="title" align="center">CHAPTER XVI<br>
  <em>(Part I)</em><br>
  OF THE OATH</h2>
<p> The third operation in any magical ceremony is the oath or proclamation. The 
  Magician, armed and ready, stands in the centre of the Circle, and strikes once 
  upon the bell as if to call the attention of the Universe. He then declares 
  "who he is", reciting his magical history by the proclamation of the grades 
  which he has attained, giving the signs and words of those grades. 
<blockquote><em>This is not merely to prove himself a person in authority. It 
  is to trace the chain of causes that have let to the present position, so that 
  the operation is seen as karma.</em></blockquote>
<p> He then states the purpose of the ceremony, and proves that it is necessary 
  to perform it and to succeed in its performance. He then takes an oath before 
  the Lord of the Universe (not before the particular Lord whom he is invoking) 
  as if to call Him to witness to the act. He swears solemnly that he will perform 
  it --- that nothing shall prevent him from performing it --- that he will not 
  leave the operation until it is successfully performed --- and once again he 
  strikes upon the bell. 
<p> Yet, having demonstrated himself in that position at once infinitely lofty 
  and infinitely unimportant, the instrument of destiny, he balances this by the 
  "Confession", in which there is again an infinite exaltation harmonised with 
  an infinite humility. He admits himself to be a weak human being humbly aspiring 
  to something higher; a creature of circumstance utterly dependent --- even for 
  the breath of life --- upon a series of fortunate accidents. He makes this confession 
  prostrate 
<blockquote><em>Compare the remarks in a previous chapter. But this is a particular 
  case. We leave its justification as a problem.</em></blockquote>
<p> before the altar in agony and bloody sweat. He trembles at the thought of 
  the operation which he has dared to undertake, saying, "Father, if it be Thy 
  Will, let this cup pass from me! Nevertheless not my will but Thine be done!" 
<blockquote><em>Of course this is for the beginner. As soon as it is assimilated 
  as true, he will say: "My will which is thine be done!" And ultimately no more 
  distinguish "mine" from "thine". A sympathetic change of gesture will accompany 
  the mental change.</em></blockquote>
<p> The dread answer comes that It Must Be, and this answer so fortifies him with 
  holy zeal that it will seem to him as if he were raised by divine hands from 
  that prostrate position; with a thrill of holy exaltation he renews joyfully 
  the Oath, feeling himself once again no longer the man but the Magician, yet 
  not merely the Magician, but the chosen and appointed person to accomplish a 
  task which, however apparently unimportant, is yet an integral part of universal 
  destiny, so that if it were not accomplished the Kingdom of Heaven would be 
  burst in pieces. 
<p> He is now ready to commence the invocations. He consequently pauses to cast 
  a last glance around the Temple to assure himself of the perfect readiness of 
  all things necessary, and to light the incense. 
<hr>
<p> The Oath is the foundation of all Work in Magick, as it is an affirmation 
  of the Will. An Oath binds the Magician for ever. In Part II of Book 4 something 
  has already been said on this subject; but its importance deserves some further 
  elaboration. Thus, should one, loving a woman, make a spell to compel her embraces, 
  and tiring of her a little later, evoke Zazel to kill her; he will find that 
  the implications of his former Oath conflict with those proper to invoke the 
  Unity of the Godhead of Saturn. Zazel will refuse to obey him in the case of 
  the woman whom he has sworn that he loves. To this some may object that, since 
  all acts are magical, every man who loves a woman implicitly takes an Oath of 
  love, and therefore would never be able to murder her later, as we find to be 
  the not uncommon case. The explanation is as follows. It is perfectly true that 
  when Bill Sykes desires to possess Nancy, he does in fact evoke a spirit of 
  the nature of Venus, constraining him by his Oath of Love (and by his magical 
  power as a man) to bring him the girl. So also, when he wants to kill her, he 
  evokes a Martial or Saturnian spirit, with an Oath of hate. But these are not 
  pure planetary spirits, moving in well-defined spheres by rigidly righteous 
  laws. They are gross concretions of confused impulses, "incapable of understanding 
  the nature of an oath". They are also such that the idea of murder is nowise 
  offensive to the Spirit of Love. 
<p> It is indeed the criterion of spiritual "caste" that conflicting elements 
  should not coexist in the same consciousness. The psalm-singing Puritan who 
  persecutes publicans, and secretly soaks himself in fire-water; the bewhiskered 
  philanthropist in broadcloth who swindles his customers and sweats his employees: 
  these men must not be regarded as single-minded scoundrels, whose use of religion 
  and respectability to cloke their villainies is a deliberate disguise dictated 
  by their criminal cunning. Far from it, they are only too sincere in their "virtues"; 
  their terror of death and of supernatural vengeance is genuine; it proceeds 
  from a section of themselves which is in irreconcilable conflict with their 
  rascality. Neither side can conciliate, suppress, or ignore the other; yet each 
  is so craven as to endure its enemy's presence. Such men are therefore without 
  pure principles; they excuse themselves for every dirty trick that turns to 
  their apparent advantage. 
<p> The first step of the Aspirant toward the Gate of Initiation tells him that 
  purity --- unity of purpose --- is essential above all else. "Do what thou Wilt" 
  strikes on him, a ray of fierce white flame consuming all that is not utterly 
  God. Very soon he is aware that he cannot consciously contradict himself. He 
  develops a subtle sense which warns him that two trains of thought which he 
  had never conceived as connected are incompatible. Yet deeper drives "Do what 
  thou wilt"; subconscious oppositions are evoked to visible appearance. The secret 
  sanctuaries of the soul are cleansed. "Do What thou Wilt" purges his every part. 
  He has become One, one only. His Will is consequently released from the interference 
  of internal opposition, and he is a Master of Magick. But for that very reason 
  he is now utterly impotent to achieve anything that is not in absolute accordance 
  with his Original Oath, with his True Will, by virtue whereof he incarnated 
  as a man. With Bill Sykes love and murder are not mutually exclusive, as they 
  are with King Arthur. The higher the type of man, the more sensitive he becomes; 
  so that the noblest love divines intuitively when a careless word or gesture 
  may wound, and, vigilant, shuns them as being of the family of murder. In Magick, 
  likewise, the Adept who is sworn to attain to the Knowledge and Conversation 
  of his Holy Guardian Angel may in his grosser days have been expert as a Healer, 
  to find that he is now incapable of any such work. He will probably be puzzled, 
  and wonder whether he has lost all his power. Yet the cause may be no more than 
  that the Wisdom of his Angel depreciates the interference of ignorant kindliness 
  with diseases which may have been sent to the sufferer for a purpose profoundly 
  important to his welfare. 
<p> In the case of THE MASTER THERION, he had originally the capacity for all 
  classes of Orgia. In the beginning, He cured the sick, bewitched the obstinate, 
  allured the seductive, routed the aggressive, made himself invisible, and generally 
  behaved like a Young-Man-About-town on every possible plane. He would afflict 
  one vampire with a Sending of Cats, and appoint another his private Enchantress, 
  neither aware of any moral oxymoron, nor hampered by the implicit incongruity 
  of his oaths. 
<p> But as He advanced in Adeptship, this coltishness found its mouth bitted; 
  as soon as He took serious Oaths and was admitted to the Order which we name 
  not, those Oaths prevented him using His powers as playthings. Trifling operations, 
  such as He once could do with a turn of the wrist, became impossible to the 
  most persistent endeavour. It was many years before He understood the cause 
  of this. But little by little He became so absorbed in the Work of His true 
  Will that it no longer occurred to Him to indulge in capricious amusements. 
<p> Yet even at this hour, though He be verily a Magus of A.'. A.'., though His 
  Word be the Word of the Aeon, though He be the Beast 666, the Lord of the Scarlet 
  Woman "in whom is all power given", there are still certain Orgia beyond Him 
  to perform, because to do so would be to affirm what He hath denied in those 
  Oaths by whose virtue He is That He is. This is the case, even when the spirit 
  of such Orgia is fully consonant with His Will. The literal sense of His original 
  Oath insists that it shall be respected. 
<p> The case offers two instances of this principle. FRATER PERDURABO specifically 
  swore that he would renounce His personal possessions to the last penny; also 
  that He would allow no human affection to hinder Him. These terms were accepted; 
  He was granted infinitely more than He had imagined possible to an incarnated 
  Man. On the other hand, the price offered by Him was exacted as strictly as 
  if it had been stipulated by Shylock. Every treasure that he had on earth was 
  taken away, and that, usually, in so brutal or cruel a manner as to make the 
  loss itself the least part of the pang. Every human affection that He had in 
  His heart --- and that heart aches for Love as few hearts can ever conceive 
  --- was torn out and trampled with such infernal ingenuity in intensifying torture 
  that His endurance is beyond belief. Inexplicable are the atrocities which accompanied 
  every step in His Initiation! Death dragged away His children with slow savagery; 
  the women He loved drank themselves into delirium and dementia before His eyes, 
  or repaid His passionate devotion with toad-cold treachery at the moment when 
  long years of loyalty had tempted Him to trust them. His friend, that bore the 
  bag, stole that which was put therein, and betrayed his Master as thoroughly 
  as he was able. At the first distant rumour that the Pharisees were out, his 
  disciples "all forsook Him and fled". His mother nailed Him with her own hands 
  to the cross, and reviled Him as nine years He hung thereupon. 
<p> Now, having endured to the end, being Master of Magick, He is mighty to Work 
  His true Will; which Will is, to establish on Earth His Word, the Law of Thelema. 
  He hath none other Will than this; so all that He doth is unto this end. All 
  His Orgia bear fruit; what was the work of a month when He was a full Major 
  Adept is to day wrought in a few minutes by the Words of Will, uttered with 
  the right vibrations into the prepared Ear. 
<p> But neither by the natural use of His abilities, though they have made Him 
  famous through the whole world, nor by the utmost might of his Magick, is He 
  able to acquire material wealth beyond the minimum necessary to keep Him alive 
  and at work. It is in vain that He protests that not He but the Work is in need 
  of money; He is barred by the strict letter of His Oath to give all that He 
  hath for His magical Attainment. 
<p> Yet more awful is the doom that He hath invoked upon Himself in renouncing 
  His right as a man to enjoy the Love of those whom He loves with passion so 
  selfless, so pure, and so intense in return for the power so to love Mankind 
  that He be chosen to utter the Word of the Aeon for their sake, His reward universal 
  abhorrence, bodily torment, mental despair, and moral paralysis. 
<p> Yet He, who hath power over Death, with breath to call back health, with a 
  touch to beckon life, He must watch His own child waste away month by month, 
  aware that His Art may not anywise avail, who hath sold the signet ring of his 
  personal profit to buy him a plain gold band for the felon finger of his bride, 
  that worn widow, the World!
