<h2 class="title" align="center">CHAPTER X<br>
  OF THE GESTURES</h2>
This chapter may be divided into the following parts:
<p> 1. Attitudes.
<p> 2. Circumambulations (and similar movements).
<p> 3. Changes of position (This depends upon the theory of the construction of 
  the circle). 
<p> 4. The Knocks or Knells. 
<h3 align="center">I</h3>
Attitudes are of two Kinds: natural and artificial. Of the first kind, prostration 
is the obvious example. It comes natural to man (poor creature!) to throw himself 
to the ground in the presence of the object of his adoration. 
<blockquote><em>The Magician must eschew prostration, or even the "bending of 
  the knee in supplication", as infamous and ignominious, an abdication of his 
  sovereignty.</em></blockquote>
Intermediate between this and the purely artificial form of gesture comes a class 
which depends on acquired habit. Thus it is natural to an European officer to 
offer his sword in token of surrender. A Tibetan would, however, squat, put out 
his tongue, and place his hand behind his right ear. Purely artificial gestures 
comprehend in their class the majority of definitely magick signs, though some 
of these simulate a natural action --- e.g. the sign of the Rending of the Veil. 
But the sign of Auramoth (see Equinox I, II, Illustration "The Signs of the Grades") 
merely imitates a hieroglyph which has only a remote connection with any fact 
in nature. All signs must of course be studied with infinite patience, and practised 
until the connection between them and the mental attitude which they represent 
appears "necessary." 
<h3 align="center">II</h3>
The principal movement in the circle is circumambulation. 
<blockquote><em>In Part II of this Book 4 it was assumed that the Magician went 
  barefoot. This would imply his intention to make intimate contact with his Circle. 
  But he may wear sandals, for the Ankh is a sandal-strap; it is born by the Egyptian 
  Gods to signify their power of Going, that is their eternal energy. By shape 
  the Ankh (or Crux Ansata) suggests the formula by which this going is effected 
  in actual practice.</em></blockquote>
This has a very definite result, but one which is very difficult to describe. 
An analogy is the dynamo. Circumambulation properly performed in combination with 
the Sign of Horus (or "The Enterer") on passing the East is one of the best methods 
of arousing the macrocosmic force in the Circle. It should never be omitted unless 
there be some special reason against it. 
<p> A particular tread seems appropriate to it. This tread should be light and 
  stealthy, almost furtive, and yet very purposeful. It is the pace of the tiger 
  who stalks the deer. The number of circumambulations should of course correspond 
  to the nature of the ceremony. 
<p> Another important movement is the spiral, of which there are two principal 
  forms, one inward, one outward. They can be performed in either direction; and, 
  like the circumambulation, if performed deosil 
<blockquote><em>i.e. In the same direction as the hands of a watch move.</em></blockquote>
they invoke --- if widdershins 
<blockquote><em>i.e. In the opposite direction.</em></blockquote>
they banish 
<blockquote><em>Such, at least, is the traditional interpretation. But there is 
  a deeper design which may be expressed through the direction of rotation. Certain 
  forces of the most formidable character may be invoked by circumambulation Widdershins 
  when it is executed with intent toward them, and the initiated technique. Of 
  such forces Typhon is the type, and the war of the Titans against the Olympians 
  the legend. (Teitan, Titan, has in Greek the numerical value of 666.) 
  <p> WEH Addenda: Crowley is using the spelling Tau-epsilon-iota-tau-alpha-nu 
    in place of the more usual Tau-iota-tau-alpha-nu or Tau-alpha-iota-tau-alpha-nu 
    to obtain 666 in place of 661 or 662. 
  </em></blockquote>
. In the spiral the tread is light and tripping, almost approximating to a dance: 
while performing it the magician will usually turn on his own axis, either in 
the same direction as the spiral, or in the opposite direction. Each combination 
involves a different symbolism. 
<p> There is also the dance proper; it has many different forms, each God having 
  his special dance. One of the easiest and most effective dances is the ordinary 
  waltz-step combined with the three signs of L.V.X. It is much easier to attain 
  ecstasy in this way than is generally supposed. The essence of the process consists 
  in the struggle of the Will against giddiness; but this struggle must be prolonged 
  and severe, and upon the degree of this the quality and intensity of ecstasy 
  attained may depend. 
<p> With practice, giddiness is altogether conquered; exhaustion then takes its 
  place and the enemy of Will. It is through the mutual destruction of these antagonisms 
  in the mental and moral being of the magician that Samadhi is begotten. 
<h3 align="center">III</h3>
Good examples of the use of change of position are given in the manuscripts Z.1 
and Z.3; 
<blockquote><em>Equinox I, II, pp. 244-260.</em></blockquote>
explanatory of the Neophyte Ritual of the G.'. D.'., where the candidate is taken 
to various stations in the Temple, each station having a symbolic meaning of its 
own; but in pure invocation a better example is given in Liber 831 
<blockquote><em>Equinox I, VII, pp. 93 sqq.</em></blockquote>
. In the construction of a ceremony an important thing to decide is whether you 
will or will not make such movements. For every Circle has its natural symbolism, 
and even if no use is to be made of these facts, one must be careful not to let 
anything be inharmonious with the natural attributions. 
<blockquote><em>The practical necessities of the work are likely to require certain 
  movements. One should either exclude this symbolism altogether, or else think 
  out everything beforehand, and make it significant. Do not let some actions 
  be symbolic and others haphazard.</em></blockquote>
For the sensitive aura of the magician might be disturbed, and the value of the 
ceremony completely destroyed, by the embarrassment caused by the discovery of 
some such error, just as if a pre-occupied T-totaller found that he had strayed 
into a Temple of the Demon Rum! It is therefore impossible to neglect the theory 
of the Circle. 
<p> To take a simple example, suppose that, in an Evocation of Bartzabel, the 
  planet Mars, whose sphere is Geburah (Severity) were situated (actually, in 
  the heavens) opposite to the Square of Chesed (Mercy) of the Tau in the Circle, 
  and the triangle placed accordingly. It would be improper for the Magus to stand 
  on that Square unless using this formula, "I, from Chesed, rule Geburah through 
  the Path of the Lion"; while --- taking an extreme case --- to stand on the 
  square of Hod (which is naturally dominated by Geburah) would be a madness which 
  only a formula of the very highest Magick could counteract. 
<p> Certain positions, however, such as Tiphareth, 
<blockquote><em>Tiphareth is hardly "dominated" even by Kether. It is the son 
  rather than the servant.</em></blockquote>
are so sympathetic to the Magus himself that he may use them without reference 
to the nature of the spirit, or of the operation; unless he requires an exceptionally 
precise spirit free of all extraneous elements, or one whose nature is difficulty 
compatible with Tiphareth. 
<p> To show how these positions may be used in conjunction with the spirals, suppose 
  that you are invoking Hathor, Goddess of Love, to descend upon the Altar. Standing 
  on the square of Netzach you will make your invocation to Her, and then dance 
  an inward spiral deosil ending at the foot of the altar, where you sink on your 
  knees with your arms raised above the altar as if inviting Her embrace. 
<blockquote><em>But NOT "in supplication".</em></blockquote>
To conclude, one may add that natural artistic ability, of you possess it, forms 
an excellent guide. All Art is Magick. 
<p> Isadora Duncan has this gift of gesture in a very high degree. Let the reader 
  study her dancing; if possible rather in private than in public, and learn the 
  superb "unconsciousness" --- which is magical consciousness --- with which she 
  suits the action to the melody. 
<blockquote><em>This passage was written in 1911 e.v. "Wake Duncan with thy Knocking? 
  I would thou couldst!"</em></blockquote>
There is no more potent means than Art of calling forth true Gods to visible appearance. 
<h3 align="center">IV.</h3>
The knocks or knells are all of the same character. They may be described collectively 
--- the difference between them consists only in this, that the instrument with 
which they are made seals them with its own special properties. It is of no great 
importance (even so) whether they are made by clapping the hands or stamping the 
feet, by strokes of one of the weapons, or by the theoretically appropriate instrument, 
the bell. It may nevertheless be admitted that they become more important in the 
ceremony if the Magician considers it worth while to take up 
<blockquote><em>Any action not purely rhythmical is a disturbance.</em></blockquote>
an instrument whose single purpose is to produce them. 
<p> Let it first be laid down that a knock asserts a connection between the Magician 
  and the object which he strikes. Thus the use of the bell, or of the hands, 
  means that the Magician wishes to impress the atmosphere of the whole circle 
  with what has been or is about to be done. He wishes to formulate his will in 
  sound, and radiate it in every direction; moreover, to influence that which 
  lives by breath in the sense of his purpose, and to summon it to bear witness 
  to his Word. The hands are used as symbols of his executive power, the bell 
  to represent his consciousness exalted into music. To strike with the wand is 
  to utter the fiat of creation; the cup vibrates with his delight in receiving 
  spiritual wine. A blow with the dagger is like the signal for battle. The disk 
  is used to express the throwing down of the price of one's purchase. To stamp 
  with the foot is to declare one's mastery of the matter in hand. Similarly, 
  any other form of giving knocks has its own virtue. From the above examples 
  the intelligent student will have perceived the method of interpreting each 
  individual case that may come in question. 
<p> As above said, the object struck is the object impressed. Thus, a blow upon 
  the altar affirms that he has complied with the laws of his operation. To strike 
  the lamp is to summon the Light divine. Thus for the rest. 
<p> It must also be observed that many combinations of ideas are made possible 
  by this convention. To strike the wand within the cup is to apply the creative 
  will to its proper complement, and so perform the Great Work by the formula 
  of Regeneration. To strike with the hand on the dagger declares that one demands 
  the use of the dagger as a tool to extend one's executive power. The reader 
  will recall how Siegfried smote Nothung, the sword of Need, upon the lance of 
  Wotan. By the action Wagner, who was instructed how to apply magical formulae 
  by one of the heads of our Order, intended his hearers to understand that the 
  reign of authority and paternal power had come to an end; that the new master 
  of the world was intellect. 
<p> The general object of a knock or a knell is to mark a stage in the ceremony. 
  Sasaki Shigetz tells us in his essay on Shinto that the Japanese are accustomed 
  to clap their hands four times "to drive away evil spirits". He explains that 
  what really happens is that the sudden and sharp impact of the sound throws 
  the mind into an alert activity which enables it to break loose from the obsession 
  of its previous mood. It is aroused to apply itself aggressively to the ideals 
  which had oppressed it. There is therefore a perfectly rational interpretation 
  of the psychological power of the knock. 
<p> In a Magical ceremony the knock is employed for much the same purpose. The 
  Magician uses it like the chorus in a Greek play. It helps him to make a clean 
  cut, to turn his attention from one part of his work to the next. 
<p> So much for the general character of the knock or knell. Even this limited 
  point of view offers great opportunities to the resourceful Magician. But further 
  possibilities lie to our hand. It is not usually desirable to attempt to convey 
  anything except emphasis, and possibly mood, by varying the force of the blow. 
  It is obvious, moreover, that there is a natural correspondence between the 
  hard loud knock of imperious command on the one hand, and the soft slurred knock 
  of sympathetic comprehension on the other. It is easy to distinguish between 
  the bang of the outraged creditor at the front, and the hushed tap of the lover 
  at the bedroom, door. Magical theory cannot here add instruction to instinct. 
<p> But a knock need not be single; the possible combinations are evidently infinite. 
  We need only discuss the general principles of determining what number of strokes 
  will be proper in any case, and how we may interrupt any series so as to express 
  our idea by means of structure. 
<p> The general rule is that a single knock has no special significance as such, 
  because unity is omniform. It represents Kether, which is the source of all 
  things equally without partaking of any quality by which we discriminate one 
  thing from another. Continuing on these lines, the number of knocks will refer 
  to the Sephira or other idea Qabalistically cognate with that number. Thus, 
  7 knocks will intimate Venus, 11 the Great Work, 17 the Trinity of Fathers, 
  and 19 the Feminine Principle in its most general sense. 
<p> Analyzing the matter a little further, we remark firstly that a battery of 
  too many knocks is confusing, as well as liable to overweight the other parts 
  of the ritual. In practice, 11 is about the limit. It is usually not difficult 
  to arrange to cover all necessary ground with that number. Secondly, each is 
  so extensive in scope, and includes aspects so diverse from a practical standpoint 
  that our danger lies in vagueness. A knock should be well defined; its meaning 
  should be precise. The very nature of knocks suggests smartness and accuracy. 
  We must therefore devise some means of making the sequence significant of the 
  special sense which may be appropriate. Our only resource is in the use of intervals. 
<p> It is evidently impossible to attain great variety in the smaller numbers. 
  But this fact illustrates the excellence of our system. There is only one way 
  of striking 2 knocks, and this fact agrees with the nature of Chokmah; there 
  is only one way of creating. We can express only ourselves, although we do so 
  in duplex form. But there are three ways of striking 3 knocks, and these 3 ways 
  correspond to the threefold manner in which Binah can receive the creative idea. 
  There are three possible types of triangle. We may understand an idea either 
  as an unity tripartite, as an unity dividing itself into a duality, or as a 
  duality harmonized into an unity. Any of these methods may be indicated by 3 
  equal knocks; 1 followed, after a pause, by 2; and 2 followed, after a pause, 
  by 1. 
<p> As the nature of the number becomes more complex, the possible varieties increase 
  rapidly. There are numerous ways of striking 6, each of which is suited to the 
  nature of the several aspects of Tiphareth. We may leave the determination of 
  these points to the ingenuity of the student. 
<p> The most generally useful and adaptable battery is composed of 11 strokes. 
  The principal reasons for this are as follows: "Firstly", 11 is the number of 
  Magick in itself. It is therefore suitable to all types of operation. "Secondly", 
  it is the sacred number par excellence of the new Aeon. As it is written in 
  the Book of the Law: "...11, as all their numbers who are of us." "Thirdly", 
  it is the number of the letters of the word ABRAHADABRA, which is the word of 
  the Aeon. The structure of this word is such that it expresses the great Work, 
  in every one of its aspects. "Lastly", it is possible thereby to express all 
  possible spheres of operation, whatever their nature. This is effected by making 
  an equation between the number of the Sephira and the difference between that 
  number and 11. For example, 2 Degree=9Square is the formula of the grade of 
  initiation corresponding to Yesod. Yesod represents the instability of air, 
  the sterility of the moon; but these qualities are balanced in it by the stability 
  implied in its position as the Foundation, and by its function of generation. 
  This complex is further equilibrated by identifying it with the number 2 of 
  Chokmah, which possesses the airy quality, being the Word, and the lunar quality, 
  being the reflection of the sun of Kether as Yesod is the sun of Tiphareth. 
  It is the wisdom which is the foundation by being creation. This entire cycle 
  of ideas is expressed in the double formula 2 Degree = 9Square, 9 Degree = 2Square; 
  and any of these ideas may be selected and articulated by a suitable battery. 
<p> We may conclude with a single illustration of how the above principles may 
  be put into practice. Let us suppose that the Magician contemplates an operation 
  for the purpose of helping his mind to resist the tendency to wander. This will 
  be a work of Yesod. But he must emphasize the stability of that Sephira as against 
  the Airy quality which it possesses. His first action will be to put the 9 under 
  the protection of the 2; the battery at this point will be 1-9-1. But this 9 
  as it stands is suggestive of the changefulness of the moon. It may occur to 
  him to divide this into 4 and 5, 4 being the number of fixity, law, and authoritative 
  power; and 5 that of courage, energy, and triumph of the spirit over the elements. 
  He will reflect, moreover, that 4 is symbolic of the stability of matter, while 
  5 expresses the same idea with regard to motion. At this stage the battery will 
  appear as 1-2-5-2-1. After due consideration he will probably conclude that 
  to split up the central 5 would tend to destroy the simplicity of his formula, 
  and decide to use it as it stands. The possible alternative would be to make 
  a single knock the centre of his battery as if he appealed to the ultimate immutability 
  of Kether, invoking that unity by placing a fourfold knock on either side of 
  it. In this case, his battery would be 1-4-1-4-1. He will naturally have been 
  careful to preserve the balance of each part of the battery against the corresponding 
  part. This would be particularly necessary in an operation such as we have chosen 
  for our example.
