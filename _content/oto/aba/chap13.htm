<h2 class="title" align="center">CHAPTER XIII<br>
  OF THE BANISHINGS:<br>
  AND OF THE PURIFICATIONS.</h2>
Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and had better come first. Purity means singleness. 
God is one. The wand is not a wand if it has something sticking to it which is 
not an essential part of itself. If you wish to invoke Venus, you do not succeed 
if there are traces of Saturn mixed up with it.
<p> That is a mere logical commonplace: in magick one must go much farther than 
  this. One finds one's analogy in electricity. If insulation is imperfect, the 
  whole current goes back to earth. It is useless to plead that in all those miles 
  of wire there is only one-hundredth of an inch unprotected. It is no good building 
  a ship if the water can enter, through however small a hole. 
<p> That first task of the Magician in every ceremony is therefore to render his 
  Circle absolutely impregnable. 
<blockquote><em>See, however, the Essay on Truth in "Konx om Pax". The Circle 
  (in one aspect) asserts Duality, and emphasizes Division.</em></blockquote>
If one littlest thought intrude upon the mind of the Mystic, his concentration 
is absolutely destroyed; and his consciousness remains on exactly the same level 
as the Stockbroker's. Even the smallest baby is incompatible with the virginity 
of its mother. If you leave even a single spirit within the circle, the effect 
of the conjuration will be entirely absorbed by it. 
<blockquote><em>While one remains exposed to the action of all sorts of forces 
  they more or less counterbalance each other, so that the general equilibrium, 
  produced by evolution, is on the whole maintained. But if we suppress all but 
  one, its action becomes irresistible. Thus, the pressure of the atmosphere would 
  crush us if we "banished" that of our bodies; and we should crumble to dust 
  if we rebelled successfully against cohesion. A man who is normally an "allround 
  good sort" often becomes intolerable when he gets rid of his collection of vices; 
  he is swept into monomania by the spiritual pride which had been previously 
  restrained by countervailing passions. Again, there is a worse draught when 
  an ill-fitting door is closed than when it stands open. It is not as necessary 
  to protect his mother and his cattle from Don Juan as it was from the Hermits 
  of the Thebaid.</em></blockquote>
The Magician must therefore take the utmost care in the matter of purification, 
"firstly", of himself, "secondly", of his instruments, "thirdly", of the place 
of working. Ancient Magicians recommended a preliminary purification of from three 
days to many months. During this period of training they took the utmost pains 
with diet. They avoided animal food, lest the elemental spirit of the animal should 
get into their atmosphere. They practised sexual abstinence, lest they should 
be influenced in any way by the spirit of the wife. Even in regard to the excrements 
of the body they were equally careful; in trimming the hair and nails, they ceremonially 
destroyed 
<blockquote><em>Such destruction should be by burning or other means which produces 
  a complete chemical change. In so doing care should be taken to bless and liberate 
  the native elemental of the thing burnt. This maxim is of universal application.</em></blockquote>
the severed portion. They fasted, so that the body itself might destroy anything 
extraneous to the bare necessity of its existence. They purified the mind by special 
prayers and conservations. They avoided the contamination of social intercourse, 
especially the conjugal kind; and their servitors were disciples specially chosen 
and consecrated for the work. 
<p> In modern times our superior understanding of the essentials of this process 
  enables us to dispense to some extent with its external rigours; but the internal 
  purification must be even more carefully performed. We may eat meat, provided 
  that in doing so we affirm that we eat it in order to strengthen us for the 
  special purpose of our proposed invocation. 
<blockquote><em>In an Abbey of Thelema we say "Will" before a meal. The formula 
  is as follows. "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." "What is thy 
  Will?" "It is my will to eat and drink" "To what end?" "That my body may be 
  fortified thereby." "To what end?" "That I may accomplish the Great Work." "Love 
  is the law, love under will." "Fall to!" This may be adapted as a monologue. 
  One may also add the inquiry "What is the Great Work?" and answer appropriately, 
  when it seems useful to specify the nature of the Operation in progress at the 
  time. The point is to seize every occasion of bringing every available force 
  to bear upon the objective of the assault. It does not matter what the force 
  is (by any standard of judgment) so long as it plays its proper part in securing 
  the success of the general purpose. Thus, even laziness may be used to increase 
  our indifference to interfering impulses, or envy to counteract carelessness. 
  See Liber CLXXV, Equinox I, VII, p. 37. This is especially true, since the forces 
  are destroyed by the process. That is, one destroys a complex which in itself 
  is "evil" and puts its elements to the one right use.</em></blockquote>
By thus avoiding those actions which might excite the comment of our neighbours 
we avoid the graver dangers of falling into spiritual pride. 
<p> We have understood the saying: "To the pure all things are pure", and we have 
  learnt how to act up to it. We can analyse the mind far more acutely than could 
  the ancients, and we can therefore distinguish the real and right feeling from 
  its imitations. A man may eat meat from self-indulgence, or in order to avoid 
  the dangers of asceticism. We must constantly examine ourselves, and assure 
  ourselves that every action is really subservient to the One Purpose. 
<p> It is ceremonially desirable to seal and affirm this mental purity by Ritual, 
  and accordingly the first operation in any actual ceremony is bathing and robing, 
  with appropriate words. The bath signifies the removal of all things extraneous 
  to antagonistic to the one thought. The putting on of the robe is the positive 
  side of the same operation. It is the assumption of the fame of mind suitable 
  to that one thought. 
<p> A similar operation takes place in the preparation of every instrument, as 
  has been seen in the Chapter devoted to that subject. In the preparation of 
  the place of working, the same considerations apply. We first remove from that 
  place all objects; and we then put into it those objects, and only those objects, 
  which are necessary. During many days we occupy ourselves in this process of 
  cleansing and consecration; and this again is confirmed in the actual ceremony. 
<p> The cleansed and consecrated Magician takes his cleansed and consecrated instruments 
  into that cleansed and consecrated place, and there proceeds to repeat that 
  double ceremony in the ceremony itself, which has these same two main parts. 
  The first part of every ceremony is the banishing; the second, the invoking. 
  The same formula is repeated even in the ceremony of banishing itself, for in 
  the banishing ritual of the pentagram we not only command the demons to depart, 
  but invoke the Archangels and their hosts to act as guardians of the Circle 
  during our pre-occupation with the ceremony proper. In more elaborate ceremonies 
  it is usual to banish everything by name. Each element, each planet, and each 
  sign, perhaps even the Sephiroth themselves; all are removed, including the 
  very one which we wished to invoke, for that forces as existing in Nature is 
  always impure. But this process, being long and wearisome, is not altogether 
  advisable in actual working. It is usually sufficient to perform a general banishing, 
  and to rely upon the aid of the guardians invoked. Let the banishing therefore 
  be short, but in no wise slurred --- for it is useful as it tends to produce 
  the proper attitude of mind for the invocations. "The Banishing Ritual of the 
  Pentagram" (as now rewritten, Liber 333, Cap. XXV) is the best to use. 
<blockquote><em>See also the Ritual called "The Mark of the Beast" given in an 
  Appendix. But this is pantomorphous.</em></blockquote>
Only the four elements are specifically mentioned, but these four elements contain 
the planets and the signs 
<blockquote><em>The signs and the planets, of course, contain, the elements. It 
  is important to remember this fact, as it helps one to grasp what all these 
  terms really mean. None of the "Thirty-two Paths" is a simple idea; each one 
  is a combination, differentiated from the others by its structure and proportions. 
  The chemical elements are similarly constituted, as the critics of Magick have 
  at last been compelled to admit.</em></blockquote>
--- the four elements are Tetragrammaton; and Tetragrammaton is the Universe. 
This special precaution is, however, necessary: make exceedingly sure that the 
ceremony of banishing is effective! Be alert and on your guard! Watch before you 
pray! The feeling of success in banishing, once acquired, is unmistakable. 
<p> At the conclusion, it is usually well to pause for a few moments, and to make 
  sure once more that every thing necessary to the ceremony is in its right place. 
  The Magician may then proceed to the final consecration of the furniture of 
  the Temple. 
<blockquote><em>That is, of the special arrangement of that furniture. Each object 
  should have been separately consecrated beforehand. The ritual here in question 
  should summarize the situation, and devote the particular arrangement to its 
  purpose by invoking the appropriate forces. Let it be well remembered that each 
  object is bound by the Oaths of its original consecration as such. Thus, if 
  a pantacle has been made sacred to Venus, it cannot be used in an operation 
  of Mars; the Energy of the Exorcist would be taken up in overcoming the opposition 
  of the "Karma" or inertia therein inherent.</em></blockquote>
