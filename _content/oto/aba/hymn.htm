<p> <strong>Thrill with lissome lust of the light,<br>
  O man! My man!<br>
  Come careering out of the night<br>
  Of Pan! Io Pan!<br>
  Io Pan! Io Pan! Come over the sea<br>
  From Sicily and from Arcady!<br>
  Roaming as Bacchus, with fauns and pards<br>
  And nymphs and satyrs for thy guards,<br>
  On a milk-white ass, come over the sea<br>
  To me, to me,<br>
  Come with Apollo in bridal dress<br>
  (Shepherdess and pythoness)<br>
  Come with Artemis, silken shod,<br>
  And wash thy white thigh, beautiful God,<br>
  In the moon of the woods, on the marble mount,<br>
  The dimpled dawn of the amber fount!<br>
  Dip the purple of passionate prayer<br>
  In the crimson shrine, the scarlet snare,<br>
  The soul that startles in eyes of blue<br>
  To watch thy wantonness weeping through<br>
  The tangled grove, the gnarled bole<br>
  Of the living tree that is spirit and soul<br>
  And body and brain --- come over the sea,<br>
  (Io Pan! Io Pan!)<br>
  Devil or god, to me, to me,<br>
  My man! my man!<br>
  Come with trumpets sounding shrill<br>
  Over the hill!<br>
  Come with drums low muttering<br>
  From the spring!<br>
  Come with flute and come with pipe!<br>
  Am I not ripe?<br>
  I, who wait and writhe and wrestle<br>
  With air that hath no boughs to nestle<br>
  My body, weary of empty clasp,<br>
  Strong as a lion and sharp as an asp ---<br>
  Come, O come!<br>
  I am numb<br>
  With the lonely lust of devildom.<br>
  Thrust the sword through the galling fetter,<br>
  All-devourer, all-begetter;<br>
  Give me the sign of the Open Eye,<br>
  And the token erect of thorny thigh,<br>
  And the word of madness and mystery,<br>
  O Pan! Io Pan!<br>
  Io Pan! Io Pan Pan! Pan Pan! Pan,<br>
  I am a man:<br>
  Do as thou wilt, as a great god can,<br>
  O Pan! Io Pan!<br>
  Io Pan! Io Pan Pan! I am awake<br>
  In the grip of the snake.<br>
  The eagle slashes with beak and claw;<br>
  The gods withdraw:<br>
  The great beasts come, Io Pan! I am borne<br>
  To death on the horn<br>
  Of the Unicorn.<br>
  I am Pan! Io Pan! Io Pan Pan! Pan!<br>
  I am thy mate, I am thy man,<br>
  Goat of thy flock, I am gold, I am god,<br>
  Flesh to thy bone, flower to thy rod.<br>
  With hoofs of steel I race on the rocks<br>
  Through solstice stubborn to equinox.<br>
  And I rave; and I rape and I rip and I rend<br>
  Everlasting, world without end,<br>
  Mannikin, maiden, Maenad, man,<br>
  In the might of Pan.<br>
  Io Pan! Io Pan Pan! Pan! Io Pan!<br>
