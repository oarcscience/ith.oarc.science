  THE LOST CONTINENT 
<h2 class="heading" align="center">by Aleister Crowley</h2>
<h3 class="heading" align="center">FORWARD</h3>
<p>&quot;In particular there is a sort of novel, &quot;The Lost Continent&quot;, 
  purporting to give an account of the civilization of Atlantis. I sometimes feel 
  that this lacks artistic unity. At times it is a fantastic rhapsody describing 
  my ideals of Utopian society; but some passages are a satire on the conditions 
  of our existing civilization, while others convey hints of certain profound 
  magical secrets, or anticipations of discoveries in science.&quot;<br>
  --- Crowley, writing of the Summer of 1913 e.v. from Confessions, p. 730.</p>
<h3 class="heading" align="center">PREFACE</h3>
<p>Last year I was chosen to succeed the venerable K-Z --- who had it in his mind 
  to die, that is, to join Them in Venus, as one of the Seven Heirs of Atlantis, 
  and I have been appointed to declare, so far as may found possible, the truth 
  about that mysterious lost land. Of course, no more than one seventh of the 
  wisdom is ever confided to one of the Seven, and the Seven meet in council but 
  once in every thirty-three years. But its preservation is guaranteed by the 
  interlocked systems of &quot;dreaming true&quot; and of &quot;preparation of 
  the antinomy.&quot; The former almost explains itself; the latter is almost 
  inconceivable to normal man. Its essence is to train a man to be anything by 
  training him to be its opposite. At the end of anything, think they, it turns 
  out to be its opposite, and that opposite is thus mastered without having been 
  soiled by the labours of the student, and without the false impressions of early 
  learning being left upon the mind.</p>
<p>I myself, for example, had unknowingly been trained to record these observations 
  by the life of a butterfly. All my impressions came clear on the soft wax of 
  my brain; I had never worried because the scratch on the wax in no way resembled 
  the sound it represented. In other words, I observed perfectly because I never 
  knew that I was observing. So, if you pay sufficient attention to your heart, 
  you will make it palpitate.</p>
<p>I accordingly proceed to a description of the country.</p>

<h3 class="heading" align="center">OF THE PLAINS BENEATH ATLAS, AND ITS SERVILE 
  RACE.</h3>
<p>Atlas is the true name of this archipelago --- continent is an altogether false 
  term, for every &quot;house&quot; or mountain peak was cut from its fellows 
  by natural, though often very narrow waterways. The African Atlas is a mere 
  offshoot of the range. It was the true Atlas that supported the ancient world 
  by its moral and magical strength, and hence the name of the fabled globe-bearer. 
  The root is the Lemurian &quot;Tla&quot; or &quot;Tlas&quot;, black, for reasons 
  which will appear in due course. &quot;A&quot; is the feminine prefix, derived 
  from the shape of the mouth when uttering the sound. &quot;Black woman&quot; 
  is therefore as near a translation as one can give in English; the Latin has 
  aendered of the Virgin (&quot;L&quot;) and the Serpent (&quot;S&quot;). &quot;THEOS&quot; 
  (root &quot;O,&quot; first written &quot;0&quot;) means the Sun in his strength 
  and also the Lingam-Yoni conjoined. &quot;CHRISTOS&quot; is &quot;The love of 
  passion of the Rising Sun (&quot;R&quot;) and the Serpent&quot; (&quot;S&quot;). 
  The &quot;I&quot; and &quot;T&quot; indicate certain details which are foreign 
  to the present discussion. &quot;NEUMA&quot; (Atlantean &quot;NM&quot;) is the 
  &quot;Arch of the Woman,&quot; &quot;MARIA,&quot; the Woman of the Sun.[23] 
  The words &quot;MEITHRAS&quot; and &quot;ABRAXAS&quot; are again derived from 
  Atlas. &quot;The woman entered, Lingam being conjoined with Yoni, bears the 
  Sun from her serpent womb&quot; and &quot;From the womb's mouth the Sun (cometh 
  seeking) a womb for his desire, even the womb of a serpent,&quot; the course 
  of the year being signified in this manner, as usualy with the ancients. This 
  plain of an idea corresponding to each letter was carried out very strictly: 
  thus &quot;TLA,&quot; black, means the stigma or mark of the virgin's womb, 
  &quot;IA&quot; (Hail! Greeting!) &quot;Face to Face,&quot; from the other peculiarity 
  described above. These few examples will suffice to indicate the singular character 
  of the language,[24] and the way in which its essential dogmatic symbols have 
  been incorporated by the heirs of Atlas in the inmost sanctuaries of races which 
  they deemed worthy of such assistance.</p>
<p>I must not pass over in silence the question of sacrifice to the gods, to which 
  a passing reference has already been made. Such sacrifices were not very frequent; 
  the victims were the &quot;failures,&quot; those who were useless to the social 
  economy.<strong>[25]</strong> As they represented capital expenditure, the object 
  was to recover this, at least, since no interest could be expected. The victim 
  was therefore handed over to a High Priest or Priestess, who extracted the life 
  by an instrument devised for and excellently adapted to the purpose, so that 
  it died of exhaustion. The life thus regained was given to &quot;the gods&quot; 
  in a manner too complex to be described in this brief account.</p>
<p>The early age at which puberty occurred was due to design. The normal period 
  of gestation had also been shortened to four months. This was all part of the 
  scheme to economize time. Old age had been almost done away with by the great 
  readiness of the Atlanteans to &quot;go and see&quot; at the first sign of failing 
  power. No doubt, further improvements would have been made but for the loss 
  of interest in the matter, all generation being regarded as &quot;the old experiment,&quot; 
  not likely to repay the trouble of further research. In the 200 or 300 years 
  of a man's full vigour, only 8 years on the average was the wastage of childhood, 
  and even this was not all waste, since some time at least must be necessary 
  for the experts to discover and direct the tendencies of the mind. The body 
  ought therefore to be regarded as an engine, the theoretical limit of whose 
  efficiency had been reached.</p>
<p>So much I mention of the customs of the Atlanteans with regard to marriage, 
  education and religious sacrifices.</p>

<h3 class="heading" align="center">VIII</h3>
<h3 class="heading" align="center">OF THE HISTORY OF ATLAS, FROM<br>
  ITS EARLIEST ORIGINS TO THE<br>
  PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING<br>
  THE CATASTROPHE.</h3>
<p>The origin of Atlas is lost in the obscurity of antiquity. The official religious 
  explanation is this: &quot;We came across the waters on the living Atla,&quot; 
  which is pious but improbable. A mystic meaning is to be suspected. The lay 
  historian says &quot;We came, escaping from destruction, eight persons in a 
  ship, bearing the living Zro.&quot; This reminds me one of later legends of 
  presumably equal value. Poets frankly claim &quot;We descended from heaven,&quot; 
  and it has been seriously urged that seafarers would have preferred the plains 
  to the rocks. The law of contrariety to Nature explains this away. Others maintain 
  that the earliest settlers came &quot;by air,&quot; or &quot;through air.&quot; 
  This must mean balloons or airplanes, as flying was not known until centuries 
  after. What is definitely known is that the earliest settlers were of a purely 
  fighting race.</p>
<p>An Atlantean Homer, Ylo, has described the first battle in such detail as to 
  leave no doubt that he is retelling facts --- a marked contradiction to his 
  earlier books. There appear to have been but few Atlanteans, unless the names 
  given are those of chiefs, which internal evidence contraverts. The natives 
  were armed with every possible instrument of precision, having cavalry and artillery 
  in abundance, as well as weapons that must have been as superior to the modern 
  rifle (unless Ylo exaggerates) as that is to the arquebus. In spite of this 
  the men of Atlas &quot;smote them with rods&quot; or &quot;fell upon them with 
  their cones,&quot; and routed them utterly. This mention of rods and cones has 
  absurdly suggested to commentators that the Atlanteans used their eyes, and 
  hypnotized the enemy. To state such an opinion is sufficient to expose its author 
  to the contempt of the thoughtful. Altogether 86 battles were fought, extending 
  over five years, before the natives were reduced to sue for peace. This was 
  granted on generous terms, which the colonists broke, as soon as they dared 
  to do so, in accordance with the invariable rule of colonists, then as much 
  as today. However, it was nigh on an hundred years before the first college 
  of Magic was established. Previously the Atla had been carried about as occasion 
  demanded. It was now enshrined with some decency of ceremonial upon a mountain. 
  About three hundred years later we find ourselves face to face with the first 
  great Mystery of Atlas. This is a translation of the record of that most strange 
  event.</p>
<p>&quot;Now it came to pass that all men turned black and died, and that the 
  living Atla abode alone, bearing Mercury, whereof the Sun knoweth. Thus came 
  again the true men of Atlas, and their women, bearing gods and goddesses. And 
  the void suffered nothing, and the earth was at peace. Now then indeed arose 
  Art, and men builded, being blind. And there was light, and some of the light 
  wrought mischief. Wherefore the wise men destroyed them with their Magic, and 
  there is no record because it is written in that which is.&quot; A sort of &quot;Si&quot; 
  &quot;monumentum quaeris, circumspice&quot; seems here implied. In any case 
  there were clearly two gaps unbridgeable between the early struggles of the 
  settlers, the period of great buildings, and the modern period, which proved 
  stable of &quot;houses.&quot; The &quot;houses&quot; were only made possible 
  by the perfecting of Zro, and this helps considerably to fix the date. The next 
  2500 years were years of peaceable progress; the labour-mills were run without 
  a hitch, and the next event was the discovery of black phophorus. It had been 
  the custom to worship the Atla with lights, and these lights had been candles 
  of yellow phosphorus in golden sheathes. At that time the Atla was veiled. At 
  one festival of Spring the veils were burnt up, the lights extinguished, and 
  the yellow phosphorus was found to have been turned into the black powder. The 
  Magicians examined this, and brought Zro to its ninth stage. This revolutionized 
  the condition of things: old age and disease were no more, and death voluntary. 
  Strangely enough this led directly to the Great Conspiracy.</p>
<p>At the end of this period of 2500 years the system of &quot;houses&quot; was 
  well established. There were over 400 such &quot;houses,&quot; each of perhaps 
  1000 souls on an average. These were governed by 4 &quot;houses of houses&quot; 
  whose rulers took orders from the High House, at the head of which was the living 
  Atla. The plain principle of Atla was revolution; and like all revolutionary 
  bodies, was obliged to adopt the strictest form of autocracy. A democracy is 
  always soddenly conservative. The only hope is to catch it in one of its moments 
  of crazy enthusiasm, and crush it before it has time to recover. Caesar and 
  Napoleon both did this as far as they could: Cromwell and Porfirio Diaz did 
  the same within narrower limits.</p>
<p>Now a certain sophist --- for philosopher one cannot call him --- tried to 
  enunciate a magical law to the effect that the present standard of life was 
  all that could be desired; that further progress would be harmful, that Venus 
  was not worth attaining, and that the sole endeavour of the Magicians should 
  be to preserve things as they were. That such a proposition could be supposed 
  a &quot;law&quot; reflects no credit on its author or its supporters. Yet of 
  these it found many. The ninth stage of Zro was a leap calculated to unsettle 
  the calmest mind. Its reality had begared the optimist's daydream. Poets had 
  thrown down their stilettos.<strong>[26]</strong> High Priests who had spent 
  decades in hopeful experiment saw their results attained by an entirely different 
  method. In short, two thirds of the people were infected with the heresy, and 
  hoped to hear it promulgated as a Law of Magic.</p>
<p>It should here be explained that every Law of Magic had its turn as the principal 
  law of practical working, and the school supporting any law, or insisting on 
  it, became prominent with it. Every dominant law in all history had always been 
  made insignificant by a new discovery about Zro, or other matter of practical 
  importance, just as the &quot;Peace with Honour&quot; battle-cry of Disraeli 
  was drowned by the calculation of the cost of warships, soldiers and patriotism. 
  Each step in Zro had consequently implied the rise to power of a new school; 
  and the sophist was ambitious, and yet the law he wished to establish was the 
  ruling law of the servile races.</p>
<p>The &quot;law&quot; was accordingly sent to the High House for approval. Some 
  opposition may have been forseen, but no one was prepared for the blackness 
  of disapproval which actually radiated, striking hearts cold. A course without 
  precedent, no answer was vouchsafed. On the contrary, even normal communication 
  was suspended. The houses which favoured the innovation --- 333 in numbers --- 
  took counsel, came to the decision that it was useless to oppose the High House, 
  and were about to acquiesce, when a woman who had once been in the presence 
  of &quot;To Her&quot; rose and thought vehemently &quot;The Living Atla is the 
  head of our conspiracy.&quot; In other words, they were the loyalists, the Magicians 
  of the High House the rebels. This was why they had cut themselves off, because 
  their own head was against them. It was instantly resolved to go to the High 
  House, and demand the custody of &quot;To Her.&quot; Nearing the goal, however, 
  a remnant of the ancient reverence half cowed even the ringleaders --- I may 
  mention that five of every six of the heretics were women --- when they saw 
  a stern phalanx of Magicians, its point threatening their centre. As they wavered, 
  a woman cried &quot;They are only men such as we are.&quot; The ranks stiffened; 
  on all sides the army closed upon the tiny phalanx, which only numbered 66 all 
  told. It was then that the truth was known. Ere a blow could be struck, the 
  attacking party vanished;</p>
<blockquote>

    used to write on the rock walls of Atlas.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>*************</p>
<p>it was instantaneous and complete annihilation. From that moment it was certain 
  that the ruling power in Atlas was Something<strong>[27]</strong> infinitely 
  more awful than the Living Atla. In order to avoid any possible repetition of 
  such a disaster --- for the Magicians of the High House knew that any manifestation 
  of the Supreme must undo the work of centuries --- they gave out that they had 
  become too terrible to look upon, and for the future they always appeared with 
  heavy veils, or rather masks, since for the most part they were carven fantastically 
  by the wearers in their leisure hours. A further alteration was made in the 
  system of government. The head of one of the &quot;houses of houses&quot; was 
  made supreme: the High House took no part in affairs of state. Thus the Atla 
  was to all intents and purposes deposed, although the same reverence and sacrifice 
  were paid to it as formerly. It became a &quot;constitutional monarch,&quot; 
  in our modern jargon.</p>
<p>The next thousand years were years of serious trial in other ways. The toil 
  of repopulation was excessive, and there was a revolt or rather strike of the 
  servile races, which was ended by the substitution of &quot;bread from heaven&quot; 
  for those products of the earth on which they had formerly been fed, a diet 
  which proved so adapted to their natures that no labour troubles ever recurred.</p>
<p>The Greek legends of the wars between Gods, giants, Titans are traditional 
  of a real war or series of wars which continued with intervals over 200 years. 
  The enemy had developed naval armament to an extreme. Their tactics were these:</p>
<p>1. To wipe out the servile races and so to interfere with the production of 
  Zro.</p>
<p>2. To rush and destroy the High House.</p>
<p>The first of these met with a great deal of success, the floating rock being 
  struck with projectiles and sunk. This occurred chiefly on the outlaying islands, 
  where they were not too much afraid to make raids in force. They also sent epidemic 
  disease of many kinds. Atlas was reduced to such extremity in these ways that 
  at one time the waterways were forced and the assault on the High House was 
  actually carried out, bombardment continuing day and night for months together. 
  Through a misunderstanding of well known magical law, Atlanteans at that time 
  considered themselves prohibited from employing any other defence than the rods 
  and the cones of their forefathers; and these, it appears, were useless against 
  machinery, or against men protected by fortification in such a way that they 
  could not be got at from any quarter. Thus the sharklike submarines of the enemy 
  were unassailable. The war was therefore at first entirely one-sided. A certain 
  youthful Magician, however, resolving to die for his country if need were, decided 
  to retaliate. He had found that Zro in its nascent state (&quot;i.e.&quot; between 
  the globes) had the power of bringing about endothermic reaction, seawater for 
  example, becoming caustic soda and hydrochloric acid; and further that this 
  acid thus produced was many thousand times more active than in its normal state. 
  For example, the rock basins in which he conducted his first experiment dissolved 
  as rapidly as butter under boiling oil. He then prepared a number of pairs of 
  receiver-globes, and dropped them in the vicinity of the enemy's submarines 
  by night. In this manner he destroyed the hulls of almost the whole fleet in 
  a single night; and the remainder fled in panic at dawn. They returned the following 
  year, carrying out daylight raids only and devoting themselves chiefly to destroying 
  the labour-mills. The young magician had been rewarded for his services by being 
  presented to the Atla, and this example encouraged others to find means of attacking 
  the invaders. Artificial darkness was therefore invented, and combined with 
  the former method; but this was only partially successful, the tremendous pace 
  of the &quot;sharks&quot; enabling them to evade any threatening clouds. They 
  did enormous</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2">[#27] This matter is not for open discussion. Even at this 
    distant date it would be dangerous to do so much even as indulge in speculation.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>*************</p>
<p>damage, and the supplies of Zro were seriously curtailed. Things now went from 
  bad to worse, and culminated in the attack on the High House, the besiergers 
  keeping their battleships surrounded by rafts of fire, so that attack was impossible 
  even by night. It was then that the High House called on the heorism of its 
  sons. Armed with long swords of Zro, they plunged into the sea, to perish under 
  the tooth of the &quot;Zhee-Zhou,&quot; but not before they had time to hack 
  the invading battleships to shreds. Their floating torch-rafts only assisted 
  the attack by directing the swimmers to their quarry. The attack on the High 
  House had aroused Atlas at last. A counter invasion was plotted and carried 
  out with immediate and complete success, the enemy being exterminated, and their 
  country not merely ravaged but destroyed by arousing the forces of earthquake. 
  All activity of this kind however was deprecable, a recurrence was guarded against 
  by removing the High House to the lofty mountain previously described, and a 
  &quot;house&quot; was chosen to cultivate the art of war, and entrusted with 
  the duty of destroying any living thing that might approach within a hundred 
  miles of Atlas.</p>
<p>Only one other adventure of historical importance remains to be recorded. It 
  is the attempt of some foolish Atlanteans to found an &quot;Empire,&quot; and 
  so to be entirely distinguished from the missionary effort referred to previously. 
  The original settlement of Atlas, as has been the case with all flourishing 
  colonies, was made by a few hardy pioneers, who strengthened themselves gradually 
  by growth. But Atlas in her momentary madness poured out blood and treasure 
  in the fatuous attempt to impose alien domination on lands utterly unsuited 
  to the genius of the people. The idea, of course, was to increase the supply 
  of labour and consequently of crude Zro. In the first place the adventure was 
  expensive. It was uneconomical (in the scientific sense) to send ships with 
  less than 1000 fighting men. The Zro required for these meant the employment 
  of at least 7000 serviles, and the naval construction was therefore of a colossal 
  order. But although little difficulty was found in conquering the country in 
  the military sense, the natives had to be almost exterminated, and the labour 
  of the survivors proved difficult to enforce. It was even then not a tenth as 
  efficient as that of the serviles at home. The imported serviles moreover caught 
  native diseases, and died in hundreds; and though by prodigious sacrifices the 
  West African Empire was kept going for nearly 200 years, it had to end at last 
  no less ingloriously than the French adventure in Mexico, or the English in 
  India, and South Africa.<strong>[28]</strong></p>
<p>The main causes were the impossibility of breeding children in a climate so 
  unsuitable, even of maintaining their own women, and above all the fact that 
  the crude Zro was not of a quality equal to that obtained in Atlas, and that 
  the Zro generated by the Atlanteans themselves was not to be made at all outside 
  their own country. The lesson was learnt. Until the end no further attempt was 
  made to advance in any but the true direction. The great majority of the colonists 
  returned to Atlas; but many, degenerating as is the fashion with colonists of 
  this conquering kind, abandoned Zro for gross food, intermarried with the natives, 
  and have generally degenerated yet further to races inferior even to the present 
  descendants of those who were in those days the equivalents of the serviles 
  of Atlas.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2">[#28] I write a little, but not much, in advance of the events. 
    To illustrate the theory here advanced I will ask the reader to compare the 
    results of the attempts to colonize America by (a) the whole military power 
    of Spain at her zenith, (b) the handful of exiles in the &quot;Mayflower.&quot;</font></p>

<h3 class="heading" align="center">IX</h3>
<h3 class="heading" align="center">OF THE CATASTROPHE,<br>
  ITS ANTECEDENTS AND<br>
  PRESUMED CAUSES.</h3>
<p>In my remarks on Zro I have a necessarily somewhat diffuse account of the properties 
  of this remarkable substance. It must now be made clearer that the crude Zro 
  in its nine stages produced by the serviles, and consumed in the &quot;houses&quot; 
  was in each stage of inferior quality to that of the same degree produced by 
  the Atlanteans, and consumed by the High House. For example, the crude Zro was 
  made in a labour-mill with all sorts of insulations. The first stage of the 
  priest's Zro could be made anywhere and at any time, and naturally directed 
  itself to the receptable for it without any precautions. It must, I think, be 
  presumed that the Zro generated in the High House was again of far greater purity 
  and potency. Very little of it can have been used in the experiments of the 
  Magicians, and it is therefore necessary to account for enormous quantities, 
  produced during many centuries of uninterrupted labour. I have, however, no 
  data of any kind for this investigation; the mysteries of the High House have 
  ever been inscrutable, and were not wholly delivered to the Heirs of Atlas. 
  They must be rediscovered by the Magicians of the new race. It may be that in 
  some form or other the Zro had been made stable, and used to impregnate the 
  column which is alleged to have been driven &quot;through the Earth&quot;; perhaps, 
  and less improbably, only to the depth of a few hundred miles. This column, 
  however long it may have been, had certainly its top immediately beneath the 
  reservoir of the High House. It had been completed about 70 years before the 
  &quot;catastrophe&quot; but apparently no effort was made to utilize it in any 
  way. To me it appears probable that in some one mind the whole &quot;catastrophe&quot; 
  was brooding, that the column was part of the device, and that the event which 
  I shall now describe was the other part.</p>
<p>This event was the birth of a child in the High House, a child without the 
  distinguishing mark of the daughters of Atlas. That any child at all should 
  have been born there is so incredible that I am inclined to suspect an improper 
  use of the word &quot;born.&quot; I think rather that a Magician brought Zro 
  to its eleventh stage, when it takes human form, and lives! The alternative 
  theory is that of the &quot;Angel of Venus&quot; described in the chapter on 
  the Underground Gardens of Atlas. The supporters of this theory hold that the 
  child was not born of a Priestess, but of the Living Atla.</p>
<p>In any case, the whole country gave itself up to unbridled rejoicing. Work 
  was carried on at a greater speed than ever before: one might say a delirium 
  of labour. For eleven years this continued without cessation, and then without 
  warning came the order to repair to the High House --- every man, woman and 
  child of Atlas. What was then done, I know not, and dare not guess; that same 
  day seven volunteers, heroic exiles from the reward of so many centuries of 
  toil, voluntary maroons on the discarded planet, the Heirs of Atlas, turned 
  their faces from the High House, and severally sought distant mountains, there 
  each to guard his share of the Secrets of the Holy Race, and in due time to 
  discover and train up fit children of other races of the Earth so that one day 
  another people might be founded to undertake another such task as that now ended.</p>
<p>Hardly had the pinnacle of Atlas melted into the sea behind them, than the 
  &quot;catastrophe&quot; occurred. The High House and the column beneath it, 
  with all the inhabitants of Atlas, shot from the Earth with the vehemence of 
  a million lightnings, bound for that green blaze of glory that scintillated 
  in the West above the sunset.</p>
<p>Instantly the Earth, its god departed, gave itself up to anguish. The sea rushed 
  unto the void of the column and in a thousand earthquakes Atlas, &quot;houses&quot; 
  and plains together were overwhelmed forever in the ocean. Tidal waves rolled 
  round the world; everywhere great floods carried away villages and towns; earthquakes 
  roocked and tempest roared; tumult was triumphant. For years after the catastrophe 
  the dying tremors of the Event still shook mankind with fear.<strong>[29]</strong> 
  And the eternal waves of the great mother rolled over Atlas, save where Earth 
  in her agony thrust up gaunt pinnacles, bare masts of wreckage to mark the vanished 
  continent. Save for its heirs, of whose successors it is my highest honour to 
  be the youngest and the least worthy, oblivion fell, like one last night in 
  which the Sun should be forever extinct, upon the land of Atlas and its people.<br>
  Shall such high purpose fail of emulation, such achievement and example not 
  excite us to like striving? Then let Earth fall indeed from her high place in 
  heaven, and mankind be outcast forever from the Sun! Men of Earth! Seek out 
  the heirs of Atlas; let them order you into a phalanx, let them build you into 
  a pyramid; that may pierce that appointed which awaits you, to establish a new 
  dynasty of Atlanteans to be the mainstay and mainspring of the Earth, the pioneers 
  of their own path to heaven, and to our lord and Father, the Sun! And he put 
  his hand upon his thigh, and swore it.</p>
