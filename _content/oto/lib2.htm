<blockquote> 
  <p>``Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.''<br>
    ``There is no Law beyond Do what thou wilt.''<br>
    ``The word of the Law is Velhma.''<br>
    Velhma--Thelema--means Will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Key to this Message is this word-Will. The first obvious meaning of this 
  Law is confirmed by antithesis; ``The word of Sin is Restriction.''</p>
<p>Again: ``Thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that and no other shall 
  say nay. For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, 
  is every way perfect.''</p>
<p>Take this carefully; it seems to imply a theory that if every man and every 
  woman did his and her will--the true will--there would be no clashing. ``Every 
  man and every woman is a star,'' and each star moves in an appointed path without 
  interference. There is plenty of room for all; it is only disorder that creates 
  confusion.</p>
<p>From these considerations it should be clear that ``Do what thou wilt'' does 
  not mean ``Do what you like.'' It is the apotheosis of Freedom; but it is also 
  the strictest possible bond.</p>
<p>Do what thou wilt--then do nothing else. Let nothing deflect thee from that 
  austere and holy task. Liberty is absolute to do thy will; but seek to do any 
  other thing whatever, and instantly obstacles must arise. Every act that is 
  not in definite course of that one orbit is erratic, an hindrance. Will must 
  not be two, but one.</p>
<p>Note further that this will is not only to be pure, that is, single, as explained 
  above, but also ``unassuaged of purpose.'' This strange phrase must give us 
  pause. It may mean that any purpose in the will would damp it; clearly the ``lust 
  of result'' is a thing from which it must be delivered.</p>
<p>But the phrase may also be interpreted as if it read ``with purpose unassuaged''--i.e., 
  with tireless energy. The conception is, therefore, of an eternal motion, infinite 
  and unalterable. It is Nirvana, only dynamic instead of static--and this comes 
  to the same thing in the end.</p>
<p>The obvious practical task of the magician is then to discover what his will 
  really is, so that he may do it in this manner, and he can best accomplish this 
  by the practices of <em>Liber Thisarb</em> (see Equinox I(7), p. 105) or such 
  others as may from one time to another be appointed.</p>
<p>Thou must (1) Find out what is thy Will. (2) Do that Will with a) one-pointedness, 
  (b) detachment, (c) peace.</p>
<p>Then, and then only, art thou in harmony with the Movement of Things, thy will 
  part of, and therefore equal to, the Will of God. And since the will is but 
  the dynamic aspect of the self, and since two different selves could not possess 
  identical wills; then, if thy will be God's will, <em>Thou art That</em>.</p>
<p>There is but one other word to explain. Elsewhere it is written-- surely for 
  our great comfort--``Love is the law, love under will.''</p>
<p>This is to be taken as meaning that while Will is the Law, the nature of that 
  Will is Love. But this Love is as it were a by-product of that Will; it does 
  not contradict or supersede that Will; and if apparent contradiction should 
  arise in any crisis, it is the Will that will guide us aright. Lo, while in 
  <em>The Book of the Law</em> is much of Love, there is no word of Sentimentality. 
  Hate itself is almost like Love! ``As brothers fight ye!'' All the manly races 
  of the world understand this. The Love of <em>Liber Legis</em> is always bold, 
  virile, even orgiastic. There is delicacy, but it is the delicacy of strength. 
  Mighty and terrible and glorious as it is, however, it is but the pennon upon 
  the sacred lance of Will, the damascened inscription upon the swords of the 
  Knight-monks of Thelema.</p>
