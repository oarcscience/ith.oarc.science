  <Enumerating the Duties><br>

<p>These Regulations Come into Force in Any District Where the Membership of the

            Equinox III(1)</font></a><font size="2"> (Detroit: Universal, 
    1919) and constitute our best and most comprehensive guidelines for Thelemic 
    social intercourse. Certain provisions will need to be modified to take advantage 
    of the U.S.A.'s comparatively enlightened tax-exemption statutes as applied 
    to religious organizations--a few are of dubious legality at this writing.

<p>Issued by Order: BAPHOMET XI° O.T.O., HIBERNIAE IONAE ET OMNIUM BRITANNIARUM, 
  REX SUMMUS SANCTISSIMUS</p>
<p><em>AN EPISTLE OF BAPHOMET to Sir GEORGE MACNIE COWIE, Very Illustrious and 
  Very Illuminated, Pontiff and Epopt of the Areopagus of the VIII</em>°<em> O.T.O. 
  Grand Treasurer General, Keeper of the Golden Book, President of the Committee 
  of Publications of the O.T.O.</em></p>
<p align="center">Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</p>
<p>IT HAS BEEN REPRESENTED TO Us that some persons who are worthy to join the 
  O.T.O. consider the fees and subscriptions rather high. This is due to your 
  failure to explain properly the great advantages offered by the Order. We desire 
  you therefore presently to note, and to cause to be circulated throughout the 
  Order, and among those of the profane who may seem worthy to join it, these 
  matters following concerning the duties and the privileges of members of the 
  earlier degrees of the O.T.O. as regards material affairs. And for convenience 
  we shall classify these as pertaining to the Twelve Houses of the Heaven, but 
  also by numbered clauses for the sake of such as understand not the so-called 
  Science of the Stars. First, therefore, concerning the duties of the Brethren. 
  Yet with our Order every duty is also a privilege, so that it is impossible 
  wholly to separate them.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>OF THE DUTIES OF THE BRETHREN</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>FIRST HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>1. There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt. Yet it is well for Brethren to 
  study daily in the Volume of the Sacred Law, Liber Legis, for therein is much 
  counsel concerning this, how best they may carry out this will.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>SECOND HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>2. The private purse of every Brother should always be at the disposal of any 
  Brother who may be in need. But in such a case it is a great mischief if the 
  one ask, and the other consent; for if the former be really in need, his pride 
  is wounded by his asking; and if not, the door is opened to beggars and imposters, 
  and all manner of arrant knaves and rogues such as are no true Brethren. But 
  the Brother who is possessed of this world's goods should make it his business 
  to watch the necessity of all those Brethren with whom he may be personally 
  acquainted, anticipating their wants in so wise and kindly and delicate a manner 
  that it shall appear as if it were the payment of a debt. And what help is given 
  shall be given with discretion, so that the relief may be permanent rather than 
  temporary.</p>
<p>3. All Brethren shall be exceedingly punctual in the payment of Lodge Dues. 
  This is to take precedence of all other calls upon the purse.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>THIRD HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>4. The Brethren shall be diligent in preaching the Law of Thelema. In all writings 
  they shall be careful to use the prescribed greetings; likewise in speech, even 
  with strangers.</p>
<p>5. They shall respond heartily to every summons of the Lodge or Chapter to 
  which they may belong, not lightly making excuse.</p>
<p>6. Brethren should use every opportunity of assisting each other in their tastes, 
  businesses, or professions, whether by direct dealing with Brethren in preference 
  to others, or by speaking well of them, or as may suggest itself. It seems desirable, 
  when possible, that where two or more Brethren of the same Lodge are engaged 
  in the same work, they should seek to amalgamate the same by entering into partnership. 
  Thus in time great and powerful corporations may arise from small individual 
  enterprises.</p>
<p>7. They shall be diligent in circulating all tracts, manifestos, and all other 
  communications which the Order may from time to time give out for the instruction 
  or emancipation of the profane.</p>
<p>8. They may offer suitable books and pictures to the Libraries of the Profess-Houses 
  of the Order.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>FOURTH HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>9. Every Brother who may possess mines, land, or houses more than he can himself 
  constantly occupy, should donate part of such mines or land, or one or more 
  of such houses to the Order.</p>
<p>10. Property thus given will be administered if he desire it in his own interest, 
  thus effecting a saving, since large estates are more economically handled than 
  small. But the Order will use such property as may happen to lie idle for the 
  moment in such ways as it may seem good, lending an unlet house (for example) 
  to some Brother who is in need, or allowing an unused hall to be occupied by 
  a Lodge.</p>
<p>11. (Yet in view of the great objects of the Order, endowment is welcome.)</p>
<p>12. Every Brother shall show himself solicitous of the comfort and happiness 
  of any Brother who may be old, attending not only to all material wants, but 
  to his amusement, so that his declining years may be made joyful.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>FIFTH HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>13. Every Brother shall seek constantly to give pleasure to all Brethren with 
  whom he is acquainted, whether by entertainment or conversation, or in any other 
  manner that may suggest itself. It will frequently and naturally arise that 
  love itself springs up between members of the Order, for that they have so many 
  and sacred interests in common. Such love is peculiarly holy, and is to be encouraged.</p>
<p>14. All children of Brethren are to be considered as children of the whole 
  Order, and to be protected and aided in every way by its members severally, 
  as by its organization collectively. No distinction is to be made with regard 
  to the conditions surrounding the birth of any child.</p>
<p>15. There is an especially sacred duty, which every Brother should fulfil, 
  with regard to all children, those born without the Order included. This duty 
  is to instruct them in the Law of Thelema, to teach them independence and freedom 
  of thought and character, and to warn them that servility and cowardice are 
  the most deadly diseases of the human soul.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>SIXTH HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>16. Personal or domestic attendants should be chosen from among the members 
  of the Order when possible, and great tact and courtesy are to be employed in 
  dealing with them.</p>
<p>17. They, on their part, will render willing and intelligent service.</p>
<p>18. While in Lodge, and on special occasions, they are to be treated as Brothers, 
  with perfect equality; such behaviour is undesirable during the hours of service, 
  and familiarity, subversive as it is of all discipline and order, is to be avoided 
  by adopting a complete and marked change of manner and address.</p>
<p>19. This applies to all persons in subordinate positions, but not to the Brethren 
  Servient in the Profess-Houses of the Order, who, giving service without recompense, 
  are to be honoured as hosts.</p>
<p>20. In case of the sickness of any Brother, it is the duty of all Brethren 
  who know him personally to attend him, to see that he want for nothing, and 
  to report if necessary his needs to the Lodge, or to Grand Lodge itself.</p>
<p>21. Those Brethren who happen to be doctors or nurses will naturally give their 
  skill and care with even more than their customary joy in service.</p>
<p>22. All Brethren are bound by their fealty to offer their service in their 
  particular trade, business, or profession, to the Grand Lodge. For example, 
  a stationer will supply Grand Lodge with paper, vellum, and the like; a bookseller 
  offer any books to the Library of Grand Lodge which the Librarian may desire 
  to possess; a lawyer will execute any legal business for Grand Lodge, and a 
  railway or steamship owner or director see to it that the Great Officers travel 
  in comfort wherever they may wish to go.</p>
<p>23. Visitors from other Lodges are to be accorded the treatment of ambassadors; 
  this will apply most especially to Sovereign Grand Inspector Generals of the 
  Order on their tours of inspection. All hospitality and courtesy shown to such 
  is shown to Ourselves, not to them only.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>SEVENTH HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>24. It is desirable that the marriage partner of any Brother should also be 
  a member of the Order. Neglect to insist upon this leads frequently to serious 
  trouble for both parties, especially the uninitiate.</p>
<p>25. Lawsuits between members of the Order are absolutely forbidden, on pain 
  of immediate expulsion and loss of all privileges, even of those accumulated 
  by past good conduct referred to in the second part of this instruction.</p>
<p>26. All disputes between Brethren should be referred firstly to the Master 
  or Masters of their Lodge or Lodges in conference; if a composition be not arrived 
  at in this manner, the dispute is to be referred to the Grand Tribunal, which 
  will arbitrate thereon, and its decision is to be accepted as final.</p>
<p>27. Refusal to apply for or accept such decision shall entail expulsion from 
  the Order, and the other party is then at liberty to seek his redress in the 
  Courts of Profane Justice.</p>
<p>28. Members of the Order are to regard those without its pale as possessing 
  no rights of any kind, since they have not accepted the Law, and are therefore, 
  as it were, troglodytes, survivals of a past civilisation, and to be treated 
  accordingly. Kindness should be shown towards them, as towards any other animal, 
  and every effort should be made to bring them into Freedom.</p>
<p>29. Any injury done by any person without the Order to any person within it 
  may be brought before the Grand Tribunal, which will, if it deem right and fit, 
  use all its power to redress or to avenge it.</p>
<p>30. In the case of any Brother being accused of an offence against the criminal 
  law of the country in which he resides, so that any other Brother cognisant 
  of the fact feels bound in self-defence to bring accusation, he shall report 
  the matter to the Grand Tribunal as well as to the Civil Authority, claiming 
  exemption on this ground.</p>
<p>31. The accused Brother will, however, be defended by the Order to the utmost 
  of its power on his affirming his innocence upon the Volume of the Sacred Law 
  in the Ordeal appointed <em>ad hoc</em> by the Grand Tribunal itself.</p>
<p>32. Public enemies of the country of any Brother shall be treated as such while 
  in the field, and slain or captured as the officer of the Brother may command. 
  But within the precincts of the Lodge all such divisions are to be forgotten 
  absolutely; and as children of One Father the enemies of the hour before and 
  the hour after are to dwell in peace, amity, and fraternity.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>EIGHTH HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>33. Every Brother is expected to bear witness in his last will and testament 
  to the great benefit that he hath received from the Order by bestowing upon 
  it part or the whole of his goods, as he may deem fit.</p>
<p>34. The death of a Brother is not to be an occasion of melancholy, but of rejoicing; 
  the Brethren of his Lodge shall gather together and make a banquet with music 
  and dancing and all manner of gladness. It is of the greatest importance that 
  this shall be done, for thereby the inherited fear of death which is deep-seated 
  as instinct in us will gradually be rooted out. It is a legacy from the dead 
  aeon of Osiris, and it is our duty to kill it in ourselves that our children 
  and our children's children may be born free from the curse.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>NINTH HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>35. Every Brother is expected to spend a great part of his spare time in the 
  study of the principles of the Law and of the Order, and in searching out the 
  key to its great and manifold mysteries.</p>
<p>36. He should also do all in his power to spread the Law, especially taking 
  long journeys, when possible, to remote places, there to sow the seed of the 
  Law.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>TENTH HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>37. All pregnant women are especially sacred to members of the Order, and no 
  effort should be spared to bring them to acceptance of the Law of Freedom, so 
  that the unborn may benefit by that impression. They should be induced to become 
  members of the Order, so that the child may be born under its aegis.</p>
<p>38. If the mother that is to be have asserted her will to be so in contempt 
  and defiance of the Tabus of the slave-gods, she is to be regarded as especially 
  suitable to our Order, and the Master of the Lodge in her district shall offer 
  to become, as it were, godfather to the child, who shall be trained specially, 
  if the mother so wishes, as a servant of the Order, in one of its Profess-Houses.</p>
<p>39. Special Profess-Houses for the care of women of the Order, or those whose 
  husbands or lovers are members of the Order, will be instituted, so that the 
  frontal duty of womankind may be carried out in all comfort and honour.</p>
<p>40. Every Brother is expected to use all his influence with persons in a superior 
  station of life (so called) to induce them to joint the Order. Royal personages, 
  ministers of State, high officials in the Diplomatic, Naval, Military, and Civil 
  Services are particularly to be sought after, for it is intended ultimately 
  that the temporal power of the State be brought into the Law, and led into freedom 
  and prosperity by the application of its principles.</p>
<p>41. Colleges of the Order will presently be established where the children 
  of its members may be trained in all trades, businesses, and professions, and 
  there they may study the liberal arts and humane letters, as well as our holy 
  and arcane science. Brethren are expected to do all in their power to make possible 
  the establishment of such Universities.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>ELEVENTH HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>42. Every Brother is expected to do all in his power to induce his personal 
  friends to accept the Law and join the Order. He should therefore endeavor to 
  make new friends outside the Order, for the purpose of widening its scpe.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>TWELFTH HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>43. The Brethren are bound to secrecy only with regard to the nature of the 
  rituals of our Order, and to our words, signs, etc. The general principles of 
  the Order may be fully explained, so far as they are understood below the VIø; 
  as it is written, ``The ordeals I write not: the rituals shall be half known 
  and half concealed: the Law is for all.'' It is to be observed that punctual 
  performance of these duties, so that the report thereof is noised abroad and 
  the fame of it cometh even unto the Throne of the Supreme and Holy King himself, 
  will weigh heavily in the scale when it comes to be a question of the high advancement 
  of a Brother in the Order.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE BRETHREN</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>FIRST HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>44. The first and greatest of all privileges of a Brother is to be a Brother; 
  to have accepted the Law, to have become free and independent, to have destroyed 
  all fear, whether of custom, or of faith, or of other men, or of death itself. 
  In other papers the joy and glory of those who have accepted The Book of the 
  Law as the sole rule of life is largely, though never fully, explained; and 
  we will not here recapitulate the same.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>SECOND HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>45. All Brethren who may fall into indigence have a right to the direct assistance 
  of the Order up to the full amount of fees and subscriptions paid by them up 
  to the time of application. This will be regarded as a loan, but no interest 
  will be charged upon it. That this privilege may not be abused, the Grand Tribunal 
  will decide whether or no such application is made in good faith.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>THIRD HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>46. Members of the Order will be permitted to use the Library in any of our 
  Profess-Houses.</p>
<p>47. Circulating Libraries will presently be established.</p>
<p>48. Brethren who may be travelling have a right to the hospitality of the Master 
  of the Lodge of the district for a period of three days.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>FOURTH HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>49. Brethren of all grades may be invited to sojourn in the Profess-Houses 
  of the Order by Grand Lodge; and such invitation may confidently be expected 
  as the reward of merit. There they will be able to make the personal acquaintance 
  of members of the higher Grades, learn of the deeper workings of the Order, 
  obtain the benefit of personal instruction, and in all ways fit themselves for 
  advancement.</p>
<p>50. Brethren of advanced years and known merit who desire to follow the religious 
  life may be asked to reside permanently in such houses.</p>
<p>51. In the higher degrees Brethren have the right to reside in our Profess-Houses 
  for a portion of every year, as shown:</p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
    <table border="0"

        cellpadding="3">
      <tr> 
        <td>VI°. Two weeks.</td>
        <td>VII°. Two months.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr> 
        <td>G.T. One month.</td>
        <td>S.G.C. Three months.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr> 
        <td>P.R.S. Six weeks.</td>
        <td>VIII°. Six months.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p>52. Members of the IX°, who share among themselves the whole property of the 
  Order according to the rules of that degree, may, of course, reside there permanently. 
  Indeed, the house of every Brother of this grade is, ipso facto, a Profess-House 
  of the Order.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>FIFTH HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>53. All Brethren may expect the warmest co-operation in their pleasures and 
  amusements from other members of the Order. The perfect freedom and security 
  afforded by the Law allows the characters of all Brethren to expand to the very 
  limits of their nature, and the great joy and gladness with which they are constantly 
  overflowing make them the best of companions. ``They shall rejoice, our chosen; 
  who sorroweth is not of us. Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious 
  languor, force and fire, are of us.''</p>
<p>54. Children of all Brethren are entitled to the care of the Order, and arrangements 
  will be made to educate them in certain of the Profess-Houses of the Order.</p>
<p>55. Children of Brethren who are left orphans will be officially adoÿted by 
  the Master of his Lodge, or if the latter decline, by the Supreme Holy King 
  himself, and treated in all ways as if they were his own.</p>
<p>56. Brethren who have a right to some especial interest in any child whose 
  mother is not a member of the Order may recommend it especially to the care 
  of their lodges or of Grand Lodge.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>SIXTH HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>57. In sickness all Brethren have the right to medical or surgical care and 
  attendance from any Brethren of the Lodge who may be physicians, surgeons, or 
  nurses.</p>
<p>58. In special necessity the Supreme Holy King will send his own attendants.</p>
<p>59. Where circumstances warrant it, in cases of lives of great value to the 
  Order and the like, he may even permit the administration of that secret Medicine 
  which is known to members of the IX°.</p>
<p>60. Members of the Order may expect Brethren to busy themselves in finding 
  remunerative occupation for them, where they lack it, or, if possible, to employ 
  them personally.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>SEVENTH HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>61. Members of the Order may expect to find suitable marriage partners in the 
  extremely select body to which they belong. Community of interest and hope being 
  already established, it is natural to suppose that where mutual attraction also 
  exists, a marriage will result in perfect happiness. (There are special considerations 
  in this matter which apply to the VII° and cannot be discussed in this place.)</p>
<p>62. As explained above, Brethren are entirely free of most legal burdens, since 
  lawsuits are not permitted within the Order, and since they may call upon the 
  legal advisers of the Order to defend them against their enemies in case of 
  need.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>EIGHTH HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>63. All Brethren are entitled after death to the proper disposal of their remains 
  according to the rites of the Order and their grade in it.</p>
<p>64. If the Brother so desire, the entire amount of the fees and subscriptions 
  which he has paid during his life will be handed over by the Order to his heirs 
  and legatees. The Order thus affords an absolute system of insurance in addition 
  to its other benefits.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>NINTH HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>65. The Order teaches the only perfect and satisfactory system of philosoÿhy, 
  religion, and science, leading its members step by step to knowledge and power 
  hardly even dreamed of by the profane.</p>
<p>66. Brethren of the Order who take long journeys overseas are received in places 
  where they sojourn at the Profess-Houses of the Order for the period of one 
  month.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>TENTH HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>67. Women of the Order who are about to become mothers receive all care, attention, 
  and honour from all Brethren.</p>
<p>68. Special Profess-Houses will be established for their convenience, should 
  they wish to take advantage of them.</p>
<p>69. The Order offers great social advantages to its members, bringing them 
  as it does into constant association with men and women of high rank.</p>
<p>70. The Order offers extraordinary opportunities to its members in their trades, 
  businesses, or professions, aiding them by co-oÿeration, and securing them clients 
  or customers.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>ELEVENTH HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>71. The Order offers friendship to its members, bringing together men and women 
  of similar character, taste, and aspiration.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>TWELFTH HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>72. The secrecy of the Order provides it members with an inviolable shroud 
  of concealment.</p>
<p>73. The crime of slander, which causes so great a proportion of human misery, 
  is rendered extremely dangerous, if not impossible, within the Order by a clause 
  in the Obligation of the Third Degree.</p>
<p>74. The Order exercises its whole power to relieve its members of any constraint 
  to which they may be subjected, attacking with vigour any person or persons 
  who may endeavour to subject them to compulsion, and in all other ways aiding 
  in the complete emancipation of the Brethren from aught that may seek to restrain 
  them from doing That Which They Will.</p>
<p>It is to be observed that these privileges being so vast, it is incumbent upon 
  the honour of every Brother not to abuse them, and the sponsors of any Brother 
  who does so, as well as he himself, will be held strictly to account by the 
  Grand Tribunal. The utmost frankness and good faith between Brethren is essential 
  to the easy and harmonious working of our system, and the Executive Power will 
  see to it that these are encouraged by all means possible, and that breach of 
  them is swiftly and silently suppressed.</p>
<p>Love is the law, love under will.</p>
<p>Our fatherly benediction, and the Blessing of the All-Father in the Outer and 
  the Inner be upon you.</p>
<p>BAPHOMET X° O.T.O., IRELAND, IONA, AND ALL THE BRITAINS</p>
