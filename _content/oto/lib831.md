(This book was formerly called Vesta. It is referred to the path of
Virgo and the letter Yod.)  

### I.

1\. This is the book of drawing all to a point.  
2. Herein are described three methods whereby the consciousness of the
Many may be melted to that of the One.  

### II. FIRST METHOD

0\. Let a magical circle be constructed, and within it an upright Tau
drawn upon the ground. Let this Tau be devised into 10 squares (See
Liber CMLXIII., Illustration 1.)  
1. Let the magician be armed with the Sword of Art.1  
2. Let him wear the black robe of a Neophyte.  
3. Let a single flame of camphor burn at the top of the Tau, and let
there be no other light or ornament.{Note 1}  
4. Let him "open" the Temple as in DCLXXI or in any other convenient
manner.  
5. Standing at the appropriate quarters, at the edge of the circle, let
him banish the 5 elements by the appropriate rituals.  
6. Standing at the edge of the circle, let him banish the 7 planets by
the appropriate rituals. Let him face the actual position of each planet
in the heavens at the time of his working.  
7. Let him further banish the twelve signs of the Zodiac by the
appropriate rituals, facing each sign in turn.  
8. Let him at each of these 24 banishings make three circumambulations
widdershins, with the signs of Horus and Harpocrates in the East as he
passes it.

---------------- 1. In circumstances where this is inappropriate let him
be armed with wand and lamp instead of as in text. --- N.  

9\. Let him advance to the square of Malkuth in the Tau, and perform a
ritual of banishing Malkuth. But here let him not leave the square to
circumambulate the circle, but use the formula and God-form of
Harpocrates.  
10. Let him advance in turn to the squares Jesod, Hod, Netzach,
Tiphereth, Geburah, Chesed and banish each by appropriate rituals.  
11. And let him know that such rituals include the pronunciation of the
appropriate names of God backwards, and also a curse against the Sephira
in respect of all that which it is, for that which distinguishes and
separates it from Kether.  
12. Advancing to the squares of Binah and Chokmah in turn, let him
banish these also. And for that by now an awe and trembling shall have
taken hold upon him, let him banish these by a supreme ritual of
inestimable puissance; and let him beware exceedingly lest his will
falter or his courage fail.  
13. Finally, let him, advancing to the square of Kether, banish that
also by what means he may. At the end whereof let him set his foot upon
the light, extinguishing it1; and, as he falleth, let him fall within
the circle.  

### SECOND METHOD

1\. Let the Hermit be seated in his Asana, robed, and let him meditate
in turn upon every several part of his body until that part is so unreal
to him that he no longer includes it in his comprehension of himself .
For example if it be his right foot, let him touch that foot, and be
alarmed, thinking, "A foot! ... foot! What is this foot? Surely I am not
alone in the Hermitage!" And this practice should be carried out not
only at the time of meditation, but during the day's work.  
2. This meditation is to be assisted by reasoning; as "This foot is not
I. If I should lose my foot, I should still be I. This foot is a mass of
changing and decaying flesh, bone, skin, blood,

---------------- 1. If armed with wand and lamp let him extinguish the
light with his hand. --- N.

lymph, etc. while I am the Unchanging and Immortal Spirit, uniform, not
made, unbegotten, formless, self-luminous," etc.  
3. This practice being perfect for each part of the body, let him
combine his workings until the whole body is thus understood as the
non-Ego and as illusion.  
4. Let then the Hermit, seated in his Asana, meditate upon the Muladhara
Cakkra and its correspondence as a power of the mind, and destroy it in
the same manner as aforesaid. Also by reasoning: "This emotion (memory,
imagination, intellect, will, as it may be) is not I. This emotion is
transient: I am immovable. This emotion is passion. I am peace", and so
on.  
Let the other Cakkras in their turn be thus destroyed, each one with its
mental or moral attribute.  
5. In this let him be aided by his own psychological analysis, so that
no part of his conscious being be thus left undestroyed. And on his
thoroughness in this matter may turn his success.  
6. Lastly, having drawn all his being into the highest Sahasrara Cakkra,
let him remain eternally fixed in meditation thereupon. 7. AUM.  

### THIRD METHOD.

1\. Let the Hermit stimulate each of the senses in turn, concentrating
upon each until it ceases to stimulate.  
(The senses of sight and touch are extremely difficult to conquer. In
the end the Hermit must be utterly unable by any effort to see or feel
the object of those senses, O.M.)  
2. This being perfected, let him combine them two at a time. For
example, let him chew ginger (taste and touch), and watch a waterfall
(sight and hearing) and watch incense (sight and smell) and crush sugar
in his teeth (taste and hearing) and so on.  
3. These twenty-five practices being accomplished, let him combine them
three at a time, then four at a time.  
4. Lastly, let him combine all the senses in a single object. And herein
may a sixth sense be included. He is then to withdraw himself entirely
from all the stimulations, perinde ac cadaver, in spite of his own
efforts to attach himself to them.  
5. By this method it is said that the demons of the Ruach, that is,
thoughts and memories, are inhibited, and We deny it not. But if so be
that they arise, let him build a wall between himself and them according
to the method.  
6. Thus having stilled the voices of the Six, may he obtain in sense the
subtlety of the Seventh.

7\. AUMGN.

(We add the following, contributed by a friend at that time without the
A: A: and its dependent orders. He worked out the method himself, and we
think it may prove useful to many. O.M.)

\(1\) The beginner must first practise breathing regularly through the
nose, at the same time trying hard to believe that the breath goes to
the Ajna and not to the lungs.  
The Pranayama exercises described in the Equinox Vol. I, No. 4, p. 101
must next be practised, always with the idea that Ajna is breathing.

Try to realise that power, not air, is being drawn into the Ajna, is
being concentrated there during Kumbhakam, and is vivifying the Ajna
during expiration. Try rather to increase the force of concentration in
Ajna than to increase so excessively the length of Kumbhakam as this is
dangerous if rashly undertaken.

\(2\) Walk slowly in a quiet place; realise that the legs are moving,
and study their movements. Understand thoroughly that these movements
are due to nerve messages sent down from the brain, and that the
controlling power lies in the Ajna. The legs are automatic, like those
of a wooden monkey: the power in Ajna is that which does the work, is
that which walks. This is not hard to realise, and should be grasped
firmly, ignoring all other walking sensations.

Apply this method to every other muscular movement.

\(3\) Lie flat on the back with the feet under a heavy piece of
furniture. Keeping the spine straight and the arms in a line with the
body, rise slowly to a sitting posture, by means of the force residing
in the Ajna (i.e. try to prevent the mind dwelling one any other
exertion or sensation.)

Then let the body slowly down to its original position. Repeat this two
or three times, every night and morning, and slowly increase the number
of repetitions.

\(4\) Try to transfer all bodily sensations to the Ajna, e.g., "I am
cold" should mean "I feel cold", or better still, "I am aware of a
sensation of cold" --- transfer this to the Ajna, "the Ajna is aware",
etc.

\(5\) Pain if very slight may easily be transferred to the Ajna after a
little practice. The best method for beginner is to imagine he has a
pain in the body and then imagine that it passes directly into the Ajna.
It does not pass through the intervening structures, but goes direct.
After continual practice even severe pain may be transferred to the
Ajna.

\(6\) Fix the mind on the base of the spine and then gradually move the
thoughts upwards to the Ajna.

(In this meditation Ajna is a Holy of Holies, but it is dark and empty.)

Finally, strive hard to drive anger and other obsessing thoughts into
the Ajna. Try to develop a tendency to think hard of Ajna when these
thoughts attack the mind, and let Ajna conquer them.

Beware of thinking of "My Ajna". In these meditations and practices,
Ajna does not belong to you; Ajna is the master and worker, you are the
wooden monkey.
