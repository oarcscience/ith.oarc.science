<P>These are all halftone photos of a single human in a black Tau robe, barefoot 
  with hood completely closed over the face. The hood displays a six-pointed figure 
  on the forehead --- presumably the radiant eye of Horus of the A.'. A.'., but 
  the rendition is too poor in detail. There is a cross pendant over the heart. 
  The ten panels are numbered in white in the upper left, but the numerals are 
  very dim even in the Ist edition (some blurred out entirely in the Weiser edition).</P>
<P>The panels are identified by two columns of numbered captions, 1 to 6 to the 
  left and 7 to 10 to the right. The description is bottom to top and left to 
  right:</P>
<P align=center><IMG height=480 src="images/102_012.jpg" 
      width=381><BR clear=left>
</P>
<P>&quot;1. Earth: the god Set fighting.&quot; Frontal figure. Rt. foot pointed 
  to the fore and angled slightly outward with weight on ball of foot. Lf. heel 
  touching Rt. heel and foot pointed left. Arms form a diagonal with body, right 
  above head and in line with left at waist height. Hands palmer and open with 
  fingers outstretched and together. Head erect.</P>
<P>&quot;2. Air: The god Shu supporting the sky.&quot; Frontal. Heels together 
  and slightly angled apart to the front, flat on floor. Head down. Arms angled 
  up on either side of head about head 1.5 ft. from head to wrist and crooked 
  as if supporting a ceiling just at head height with the finger tips. The palms 
  face upward and the backs of the hands away from the head. Thumbs closed to 
  side of palms. Fingers straight and together.</P>
<P>&quot;3. Water: the goddess Auramoth.&quot; Same body and foot position as 
  #2, but head erect. Arms are brought down over the chest so that the thumbs 
  touch above the heart and the backs of the hands are to the front. The fingers 
  meet below the heart, forming between thumbs and fingers the descending triangle 
  of water.</P>
<P>&quot;4. Fire: the goddess Thoum-aesh-neith.&quot; Frontal. Head and body like 
  #3. Arms are angled so that the thumbs meet in a line over the brow. Palmer 
  side facing. Fingers meet above head, forming between thumbs and fingers the 
  ascending triangle of fire.</P>
<P>&quot;5,6. Spirit: the rending and closing of the veil.&quot; Head erect in 
  both. #5 has the same body posture as #1, except that the left and right feet 
  are countercharged and flat on the floor. Arms and hands are crooked forward 
  at shoulder level such that the hands appear to be clawing open a split veil 
  --- hands have progressed to a point that the forearms are invisible, being 
  directly pointed at the front. Upper arms are flat and horizontal in the plain 
  of the image. #6. has the same body posture as #1, feet in same position as 
  #1 but flat to the floor. The arms are elbow down against abdomen, with hands 
  forward over heart in claws such that the knuckles are touching. Passing from 
  #5 to #6 or vice versa is done by motion of shoulders and rotation of wrists. 
  This is different from the other sign of opening the veil, the Sign of the Enterer, 
  with is done with hands flat palm to palm and then spread without rotation of 
  wrists.</P>
<P>&quot;7-10. The L V X signs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;7. + Osiris slain --- the cross.&quot; Body and feet as in #2. Head bowed. 
  Arms directly horizontal from the shoulders in the plane of the image. Hands 
  with fingers together, thumbs to side of palm and palmer side forward. The tau 
  shape of the robe dominates the image.</P>
<P>&quot;8. L Isis mourning --- the Svastica.&quot; The body is in semi-profile, 
  head down slightly and facing right of photograph. The arms, hands, legs and 
  feet are positioned to define a swastika. Left foot flat, carrying weight and 
  angled toward the right of the photo. Right foot toe down behind the figure 
  to the left in the photo. Right upper arm due left in photo and forearm vertical 
  with fingers closed and pointing upward. Left arm smoothly canted down to the 
  right of photo, with fingers closed and pointed down.</P>
<P>&quot;9. V Typhon --- the Trident.&quot; Figure frontal and standing on tip 
  toe, toes forward and heals not touching. Head back. Arms angled in a &quot;V&quot; 
  with the body to the top and outward in the plain of the photo. Fingers and 
  thumbs as #7, but continuing the lines of the arms.</P>
<P>&quot;10. X Osiris risen --- the Pentagram.&quot; Body and feet as in #7. Head 
  directly frontal and level. Arms crossed over heart, right over left with hands 
  extended, fingers closed and thumb on side such that the palms rest on the two 
  opposite shoulders.}</P>

  MANVS ET SAGITTAE<br>
  SVB FIGVRA<br>
  VI <br>
  I.</H3>
<P>1. This book is very easy to misunderstand; readers are asked to use the most 
  minute critical care in the study of it, even as we have done in its preparation.</P>
<P>2. In this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth and the Paths; of Spirits and 
  Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres, Planes, and many other things which may or may 
  not exist.</P>
<P>It is immaterial whether these exist or not. By doing certain things certain 
  results will follow; students are most earnestly warned against attributing 
  objective reality or philosophic validity to any of them.</P>
<P>3. The advantages to be gained from them are chiefly these:<BR>
  (&quot;a&quot;) A widening of the horizon of the mind.<BR>
  (&quot;b&quot;) An improvement of the control of the mind.</P>
<P>4. The student, if he attains any success in the following practices, will 
  find himself confronted by things (ideas or {13} beings) too glorious or too 
  dreadful to be described. It is essential that he remain the master of all that 
  he beholds, hears or conceives; otherwise he will be the slave of illusion, 
  and the prey of madness.</P>
<P>Before entering upon any of these practices, the student should be in good 
  health, and have attained a fair mastery of Asana, Pranayama and Dharana.</P>
<P>5. There is little danger that any student, however idle or stupid, will fail 
  to get some result; but there is great danger that he will be led astray, obsessed 
  and overwhelmed by his results, even though it be by those which it is necessary 
  that he should attain. Too often, moreover, he mistaketh the first resting-place 
  for the goal, and taketh off his armour as if he were a victor ere the fight 
  is well begun.</P>
<P>It is desirable that the student should never attach to any result the importance 
  which it at first seems to possess.</P>
<P>6. First, then, let us consider the Book &quot;777&quot; and its use; the preparation 
  of the Place; the use of the Magic Ceremonies; and finally the methods which 
  follow in Chapter V. &quot;Viator in Regnis Arboris,&quot; and in Chapter VI. 
  &quot;Sagitta trans Lunam.&quot;</P>
<P>(In another book will it be treated of the Expansion and Contraction of Consciousness; 
  progress by slaying the Chakkrams; progress by slaying the Pairs of Opposites; 
  the methods of Sabhapaty Swami, &amp;c., &amp;c.)</P>
<H3 align="center" class="heading">II.</H3>
<P>1. The student must FIRST obtain a thorough knowledge of &quot;Book 777&quot;, 
  especially of columns i., ii., iii., v., vi., vii., ix., xi., xii., xiv., xv., 
  xvi., xvii., xviii., xix., xxxiv., xxxv., xxxviii., {14} xxxix., xl., xli., 
  xlii., xlv., liv., lv., lix., lx., lxi., lxiii., lxx., lxxv., lxxvii., lxviii., 
  lxxix., lxxx., lxxxi., lxxxiii., xcvii., xcviii., xcix., c., ci., cxvii., cxviii., 
  cxxxvii., cxxxviii., cxxxix., clxxv., clxxvi., clxxvii., clxxxii.</P>
<P>When these are committed to memory, he will begin to understand the nature 
  of these correspondences. (&quot;See&quot; Illustrations &quot;The Temple of 
  Solomon the King&quot; in this number. Cross references are given.)</P>
<P>2. If we take an example, the use of the table will become clear.<BR>
  Let us suppose that you wish to obtain knowledge of some obscure science.<BR>
  In column xlv., line 12, you will find &quot;Knowledge of Sciences.&quot; </P>
<P>By now looking up line 12 in the other columns, you will find that the Planet 
  corresponding is Mercury, its number eight, its lineal figures the octagon and 
  octagram. The God who rules that planet Thoth, or in Hebrew symbolism Tetragrammaton 
  Adonai and Elohim Tzabaoth, its Archangel Raphael, its Choir of Angels Beni 
  Elohim, its Intelligence Tiriel, its Spirit Taphtatharath, its colours Orange 
  (for Mercury is the Sphere of the Sephira Hod, 8), Yellow, Purple, Grey, and 
  Indigo rayed with Violet; its Magical Weapon the Wand or Caduceus, its Perfumes 
  Mastic and others, its sacred plants Vervain and others, its jewel the Opal 
  or Agate; its sacred animal the Snake, &amp;c., &amp;c.</P>
<P>3. You would then prepare your Place of Working accordingly. In an orange circle 
  you would draw an eight-pointed star of yellow, at whose points you would place 
  eight lamps. The Sigil of the Spirit (which is to be found in Cornelius {15} 
  Agrippa and other books) you would draw in the four colours with such other 
  devices as your experience may suggest.</P>
<P>4. And so on. We cannot here enter at length into all the necessary preparations; 
  and the student will find them fully set forth in the proper books, of which 
  the &quot;Goetia&quot; is perhaps the best example.</P>
<P>These rituals need not be slavishly imitated; on the contrary the student should 
  do nothing the object of which he does not understand; also, if he have any 
  capacity whatever, he will find his own crude rituals more effective than the 
  highly polished ones of other people.</P>
<P>The general purpose of all this preparation is as follows:<BR>
  5. Since the student is a man surrounded by material objects, if it be his wish 
  to master one particular idea, he must make every material object about him 
  directly suggest that idea. Thus in the ritual quoted, if his glance fall upon 
  the lights, their number suggests Mercury; he smells the perfumes, and again 
  Mercury is brought to his mind. In other words, the whole magical apparatus 
  and ritual is a complex system of mnemonics.</P>
<P>[The importance of these lies principally in the fact that particular sets 
  of images that the student may meet in his wanderings correspond to particular 
  lineal figures, divine names, &amp;c. and are controlled by them. As to the 
  possibility of producing results external to the mind of the seer (&quot;objective,&quot; 
  in the ordinary common sense acceptation of the term) we are here silent.]</P>
<P>6. There are three important practices connected with all forms of ceremonial 
  (and the two Methods which later we shall describe). These are: {16}<BR>
  (1) Assumption of God-forms.<BR>
  (2) Vibration of Divine Names.<BR>
  (3) Rituals of &quot;Banishing&quot; and &quot;Invoking&quot;.<BR>
  These, at least, should be completely mastered before the dangerous Methods 
  of Chapters V. and VI. are attempted.</P>
<H3 align="center" class="heading">III</H3>
<P>1. The Magical Images of the Gods of Egypt should be made thoroughly familiar. 
  This can be done by studying them in any public museum, or in such books as 
  may be accessible to the student. They should then be carefully painted by him, 
  both from the model and from memory.</P>
<P>2. The student, seated in the &quot;God&quot; position, or in the characteristic 
  attitude of the God desired, should then imagine His image as coinciding with 
  his own body, or as enveloping it. This must be practised until mastery of the 
  image is attained, and an identity with it and with the God experienced.</P>
<P>It is a matter for very great regret that no simple and certain test of success 
  in this practice exists.</P>
<P>3. The Vibration of God-names. As a further means of identifying the human 
  consciousness with that pure portion of it which man calls by the name of some 
  God, let him act thus:</P>
<P>4. (&quot;a&quot;) Stand with arms outstretched. (&quot;See&quot; illustration.)<BR>
  (&quot;b&quot;) Breathe in deeply through the nostrils, imagining the name of 
  the God desired entering with the breath.<BR>
  (&quot;c&quot;) Let that name descend slowly from the lungs to the heart, the 
  solar plexus, the navel, the generative organs, and so to the feet. {17}<BR>
  (&quot;d&quot;) The moment that it appears to touch the feet, quickly advance 
  the left foot about 12 inches, throw forward the body, and let the hands (drawn 
  back to the side of the eyes) shoot out, so that you are standing in the typical 
  position of the God Horus,[&quot;See&quot; Illustration in Vol. I. No. 1, &quot;Blind 
  Force.&quot;] and at the same time imagine the Name as rushing up and through 
  the body, while you breathe it out through the nostrils with the air which has 
  been till then retained in the lungs. All this must be done with all the force 
  of which you are capable. <BR>
  (&quot;e&quot;) Then withdraw the left foot, and place the right forefinger 
  upon the lips, so that you are in the characteristic position of the God Harpocrates[&quot;See&quot; 
  Illustration in Vol. I. No. 1, &quot;The Silent Watcher.&quot;]</P>
<P>5. It is a sign that the student is performing this correctly when a single 
  &quot;Vibration&quot; entirely exhausts his physical strength. It should cause 
  him to grow hot all over, or to perspire violently, and it should so weaken 
  him that he will find it difficult to remain standing.</P>
<P>6. It is a sign of success, though only by the student himself is it perceived, 
  when he hears the name of the God vehemently roared forth, as if by the concourse 
  of ten thousand thunders; and it should appear to him as if that Great Voice 
  proceeded from the Universe, and not from himself.</P>
<P>In both the above practices all consciousness of anything but the God-form 
  and name should be absolutely blotted out; and the longer it takes for normal 
  perception to return, the better. {18}</P>
<H3 align="center" class="heading">IV</H3>
<P>I. The Rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram must be committed to memory; they 
  are as follows:</P>
<H3 align="center" class="heading">The Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram 
  <P>(i) Touching the forehead say Ateh (Unto Thee).<BR>
    (ii) Touching the breast say Malkuth (The Kingdom).<BR>
    (iii) Touching the right shoulder, say ve-Geburah (and the Power).<BR>
    (iv) Touching the left shoulder, say ve-Gedulah (and the Glory).<BR>
    (v) Clasping the hands upon the breast, say le-Olahm, Amen (To the Ages, Amen).<BR>
    (vi) Turning to the East make a pentagram (that of Earth) with the proper 
    weapon (usually the Wand). Say (&quot;i.e.&quot; vibrate) I H V H.<BR>
    (vii) Turning to the South, the same, but say A D N I.<BR>
    (viii) Turning to the West, the same, but say A H I H.<BR>
    (ix) Turning to the North, the same, but say A G L A.</P>
  <P>Pronounce: Ye-ho-wau, Adonai, Eheieh, Agla.</P>
  <P>(x) Extending the arms in the form of a Cross say:<BR>
    (xi) Before me Raphael;<BR>
    (xii) Behind me Gabriel;<BR>
    (xiii) On my right hand Michael.<BR>
    (xiv) On my left hand Auriel;<BR>
    (xv) For about me flames the Pentagram,<BR>
    (xvi) And in the Column stands the six-rayed Star.<BR>
    (xvii-xxi) Repeat (i) to (v), the Qabalistic Cross. {19}</P>
  <H3 align="center" class="heading">The Greater Ritual of the Pentagram.</h3>

<P>For Caput and Cauda Draconis use the lunar hexagram, with the sigil of Caput 
  Draconis or Cauda Draconis.</P>
<P>To banish, reverse the hexagram.</P>
<P>In all cases use a conjuration first with Ararita, and next with the name of 
  the God corresponding to the planet or sign you are dealing with.</P>
<P>The Hexagrams pertaining to the planets are as in plate on preceding page.</P>
<P>2. These rituals should be practised until the figures drawn appear in flame, 
  in flame so near to physical flame that it would perhaps be visible to the eyes 
  of a bystander, were one present. It is alleged that some persons have attained 
  the power of actually kindling fire by these means. Whether this be so or not, 
  the power is not one to be aimed at.</P>
<P>3. Success in &quot;banishing&quot; is known by a &quot;feeling of cleanliness&quot; 
  in the atmosphere; success in &quot;invoking&quot; by a &quot;feeling of holiness.&quot; 
  It is unfortunate that these terms are so vague.</P>
<P>But at least make sure of this: that any imaginary figure or being shall instantly 
  obey the will of the student, when he uses the appropriate figure. In obstinate 
  cases, the form of the appropriate God may be assumed.</P>
<P>4. The banishing rituals should be used at the commencement of any ceremony 
  whatever. Next, the student should use a general invocation, such as the &quot;Preliminary 
  Invocation&quot; in the &quot;Goetia&quot; as well as a special invocation to 
  suit the nature of his working.</P>
<P>5. Success in these verbal invocations is so subtle a {26} matter, and its 
  grades so delicately shaded, that it must be left to the good sense of the student 
  to decide whether or not he should be satisfied with his result.</P>
<H3 align="center" class="heading">V</H3>
<P>1. Let the student be at rest in one of his prescribed positions, having bathed 
  and robed with the proper decorum. Let the place of working be free from all 
  disturbance, and let the preliminary purifications, banishings and invocations 
  be duly accomplished, and, lastly, let the incense be kindled.</P>
<P>2. Let him imagine his own figure (preferably robed in the proper magical garments 
  and armed with the proper magical weapons) as enveloping his physical body, 
  or standing near to and in front of him.</P>
<P>3. Let him then transfer the seat of his consciousness to that imagined figure; 
  so that it may seem to him that he is seeing with its eyes, and hearing with 
  its ears.</P>
<P>This will usually be the great difficulty of the operation.</P>
<P>4. Let him then cause that imagined figure to rise in the air to a great height 
  above the earth.</P>
<P>5. Let him then stop and look about him. (It is sometimes difficult to open 
  the eyes.)</P>
<P>6. Probably he will see figures approaching him, or become conscious of a landscape.</P>
<P>Let him speak to such figures, and insist upon being answered, using the proper 
  pentagrams and signs, as previously taught.</P>
<P>7. Let him travel about at will, either with or without guidance from such 
  figure or figures. {27}</P>
<P>8. Let him further employ such special invocations as will cause to appear 
  the particular places he may wish to visit.</P>
<P>9. Let him beware of the thousand subtle attacks and deceptions that he will 
  experience, carefully testing the truth of all with whom he speaks.</P>
<P>Thus a hostile being may appear clothed with glory; the appropriate pentagram 
  will in such a case cause him to shrivel or decay.</P>
<P>10. Practice will make the student infinitely wary in these matters.</P>
<P>11. It is usually quite easy to return to the body, but should any difficulty 
  arise, practice (again) will make the imagination fertile. For example, one 
  may create in thought a chariot of fire with white horses, and command the charioteer 
  to drive earthwards.</P>
<P>It might be dangerous to go too far, or to stay too long; for fatigue must 
  be avoided.</P>
<P>The danger spoken of is that of fainting, or of obsession, or of loss of memory 
  or other mental faculty.</P>
<P>12. Finally, let the student cause his imagined body in which he supposes himself 
  to have been travelling to coincide with the physical, tightening his muscles, 
  drawing in his breath, and putting his forefinger to his lips. Then let him 
  &quot;awake&quot; by a well-defined act of will, and soberly and accurately 
  record his experiences.</P>
<P>It may be added that this apparently complicated experiment is perfectly easy 
  to perform. It is best to learn by &quot;travelling&quot; with a person already 
  experienced in the matter. Two or three experiments will suffice to render the 
  student confident and even expert. See also &quot;The Seer&quot;, pp. 295-333.</P>
<H3 align="center" class="heading">VI</H3>
<P>1. The previous experiment has little value, and leads to few results of importance. 
  But it is susceptible of a development which merges into a form of Dharana --- 
  concentration --- and as such may lead to the very highest ends. The principal 
  use of the practice in the last chapter is to familiarise the student with every 
  kind of obstacle and every kind of delusion, so that he may be perfect master 
  of every idea that may arise in his brain, to dismiss it, to transmute it, to 
  cause it instantly to obey his will.</P>
<P>2. Let him then begin exactly as before, but with the most intense solemnity 
  and determination.</P>
<P>3. Let him be very careful to cause his imaginary body to rise in a line exactly 
  perpendicular to the earth's tangent at the point where his physical body is 
  situated (or to put it more simply, straight upwards).</P>
<P>4. Instead of stopping, let him continue to rise until fatigue almost overcomes 
  him. If he should find that he has stopped without willing to do so, and that 
  figures appear, let him at all costs rise above them.</P>
<P>Yea, though his very life tremble on his lips, let him force his way upward 
  and onward! 5. Let him continue in this so long as the breath of life is in 
  him. Whatever threatens, whatever allures, though it were Typhon and all his 
  hosts loosed from the pit and leagued against him, though it were from the very 
  Throne of God Himself that a Voice issues bidding him stay and be content, let 
  him struggle on, ever on.</P>
<P>6. At last there must come a moment when his whole {29} being is swallowed 
  up in fatigue, overwhelmed by its own inertia.<strong>*</strong> </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <P><strong>*</strong> This in case of failure. The results of success are so 
    many and wonderful that no effort is here made to describe them. They are 
    classified, tentatively, in the &quot;Herb 
    Dangerious,&quot; Part II., &quot;infra&quot;.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Let him sink (when no longer can he strive, though his tongue by bitten through 
  with the effort and the blood gush from his nostrils) into the blackness of 
  unconsciousness; and then, on coming to himself, let him write down soberly 
  and accurately a record of all that hath occurred, yea a record of all that 
  hath occurred.</P>
