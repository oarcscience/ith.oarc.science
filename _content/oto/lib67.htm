  <blockquote> 
    <p>I flung out of chapel and church<br>
      Temple and hall an meeting-room <br>
      Venus' Bower and Osiris' Tomb, <br>
      and left the devil in the lurch, <br>
      While God got lost in the crowd of gods, <br>
      And soul went down in the turbid tide <br>
      Of the metaphysical Lotus-eyed, <br>
      And I was -- anyhow, what's the odds? <br>
      [...] <br>
      Yet by-and-by I hope to weave <br>
      A song of Anti-Christmas Eve <br>
      And First- and Second-Beast-er Day. <br>
      There's one who loves me dearly (vrai!) <br>
      Who yet believes me sprung from Tophet, <br>
      Either the Beast or the False Prophet; <br>
      And by all sorts of monkey tricks <br>
      Adds up my name to Six Six Six. <br>
      Retire, good Gallup! In such strife her <br>
      Superior skill makes <em>you</em> a cipher! <br>
      Ho! I adopt the number. Look <br>
      At the quaint wrapper of this book! <br>
      I will deserve it if I can: It is the number of a Man. </p>

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>I find some folks think me (for one) <br>
      So great a fool that I disclaim <br>
      Indeed Jehovah's hate for shame <br>
      That man to-day should not be weaned <br>
      Of worshipping so foul a fiend <br>
      In presence of the living Sun, <br>
      And yet replace him oiled and clean <br>
      By the Egyptian Pantheon, <br>
      The same thing by another name. <br>
      Thus when of late Egyptian Gods <br>
      Evoked ecstatic periods <br>
      In verse of mine, you thought I praised <br>
      Or worshipped them -- I stand amazed. <br>
      I merely wished to chant in verse <br>
      Some aspects of the Universe, <br>
      Summed up these subtle forces finely, <br>
      And sang of them (I think divinely) <br>
      In name and form; a fault perhaps -- <br>
      Reviewers are such funny chaps! <br>
      I think that ordinary folk, <br>
      Though, understood the things I spoke. <br>
      For Gods, and devils too, I find <br>
      Are merely modes of my own mind! </p>
