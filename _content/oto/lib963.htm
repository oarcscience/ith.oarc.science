<P align="center">Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. </P>
<P>According to Hymenaeus Alpha in his Preface to &quot;The Holy Books of Thelema&quot;, 
  published by Samuel Weiser in 1983 only the short prefatory note is in Class 
  A, the remainder of the book is in Class B. It is therefore not considered to 
  be a &quot;Holy Book&quot;, however since it has proven its worth otherwise, 
  and since an earnest member of the Argentum Astrum will follow the instructions 
  in that class A note, we present it to you here. </P>
<P align=left>I have used it as part of planetary, and zodiac rituals for some 
  time, and recomend it for this purpose. Love is the law, love under will. </P>

  <LI>Let the student recite this book, particularly the 169 adorations, unto 
    his Star as it ariseth. 
  <LI>Let him seek out diligently in the sky his Star; let him travel thereunto 
    in his Shell; let him adore it unceasingly from its rising even unto its setting 
    by the right adorations, with chants that shall be harmonious therewith. 
  <LI>Let him rock himself to and fro in adoration; let him spin around his own 
    axis in adoration; let him leap up and down in adoration. 
  <LI>Let him inflame himself in the adoration, speeding from slow to fast, until 
    he can no more. 
  <LI>This also shall be sung in open places, as heaths, mountains, woods, and 
    by streams and upon islands. 
  <LI>Moreover, ye shall build you fortified places in great cities; caverns and 
    tombs shall be made glad with your praise.

  <DD>000. In the Beginning there was Naught, and Naught spake unto Naught saying: 
    Let us beget on the Nakedness of our Nothingness the Limitless, Eternal, Identical, 
    and United: And without will, intention, thought, word, desire, or deed, it 
    was so. 
  <DD>00. Then in the depths of Nothingness hovered the Limitless, as a raven 
    in the night; seeing naught, hearing naught, and understanding naught: neither 
    was it seen, nor heard, nor understood; for as yet Countenance beheld not 
    Countenance. 
  <DD>0. And as the Limitless stretched forth its wings, an unextended unextendable 
    Light became; colourless, formless, conditionless, effluent, naked, and essential, 
    as a crystalline dew of creative effulgence; and fluttering as a dove betwixt 
    Day and Night, it vibrated forth a lustral Crown of Glory. </DD>
</DL>
<OL>
  <LI>And out of the blinding whiteness of the Crown grew an Eye, like unto an 
    egg of an humming-bird cherished on a platter of burnished silver. 
  <LI>Thus I beheld Thee, O my God, the lid of whose Eye is as the Night of Chaos, 
    and the pupil thereof as the marshalled order of the spheres. 
  <LI>For, I am but as a blind man, who wandering through the noontide perceiveth 
    not the loveliness of day; and even as he whose eyes are unenlightened beholdeth 
    not the greatness of this world in the depths of a starless night, so am I 
    who am not able to search the unfathomable depths of Thy wisdom. 
  <LI>For what am I that I durst look upon Thy Countenance, purblind one of small 
    understanding that I am, blindly groping through the night of mine ignorance 
    like unto a little maggot hid in the dark depths of a corrupted corpse? 
  <LI>Therefore, O my God, fashion me into a five-pointed star of ruby burning 
    beneath the foundations of Thy Unity, that I may mount the pillar of Thy Glory, 
    and be lost in adoration of the triple Unity of Thy Godhead, I beseech Thee, 
    O Thou who art to me as the Finger of Light thrust through the black clouds 
    of Chaos; I beseech Thee, O my God, hearken Thou unto my cry! 
  <LI>Then, O my God, am I not risen as the sun that eateth up ocean as a golden 
    lion that feedeth on a blue-grey wolf? So shall I become one with Thy Beauty, 
    worn upon Thy breast as the Centre of a Sixfold Star of ruby and of sapphire. 
  <LI>Yea, O God, gird Thou me upon Thy thigh as a warrior girdeth his sword! 
    Smite my acuteness into the earth, and as a sower casteth his seed into the 
    furrows of the plough, do Thou beget upon me these adorations of Thy Unity, 
    O My Conqueror! 
  <LI>And Thou shalt carry me upon Thine hip, O Thou flashing God, as a black 
    mother of the South Country carrieth her babe. Whence I shall reach my lips 
    to Thy pap, and sucking out Thy stars, shed them in these adorations upon 
    the Earth. 
  <LI>Moreover, O God my God, Thou who hast cloven me with Thine amethystine Phallus, 
    with Thy Phallus adamantine, with Thy Phallus of Gold and Ivory! thus am I 
    cleft in twain as two halves of a child that is split asunder by the sword 
    of the eunuchs, and mine adorations are divided, and one contendeth against 
    his brother. Unite Thou me even as a split tree that closeth itself again 
    upon the axe, that my song of praise unto Thee may be One Song! 
  <LI>For I am Thy chosen Virgin, O my God! Exalt Thou me unto the throne of the 
    Mother, unto the Garden of Supernal Dew, unto the Unutterable Sea! </LI>

  <LI>&nbsp;O Thou Empress of Light and of Darkness, Thou pourer-forth of the

    eyes of a blind man smitten by a torch of burning fire. 
  <LI><IMG height=25 src="images/liten_pisc.gif" width=26> 
  <LI>&nbsp;O Thou crimson gladness of the midnight, Thou flamingo North of brooding

  <LI>The Light of my Life is as the light of two moons, one rising and the other 
    setting, one increasing and the other waning; the one growing fat as the other 
    groweth lean, like a paunchy thief sucking dry a skin of amber wine. Yet though 
    the light of the first devoureth the light of the second, nevertheless the 
    light of the second disgorgeth the light of the first, so that there is neither 
    the desire of light nor the need of light--- all being as a woven twilight 
    of day and night, a madness of mingling moons. Yet I behold! 
  <LI>Now mine eyes are seven, and are as stars about a star; and the lids of 
    mine eyes are fourteen, two to each eye. Also have I seven arms to do the 
    bidding of the seven eyes; and each arm hath an hand of three fingers, so 
    that I may rule the great ocean and burn it up with the Spirit of Flame, and 
    that I may drown the fire in the Abode of the Waters. Thus I am rendered naked; 
    for neither flame nor water can clothe me; therefore am I as a breath of wind 
    blown over an Earth of Adamant, that knoweth neither sorrow nor rejoicing; 
    then do I abide as a River of Light between the Night of Chaos and the Day 
    of Creation. 
  <LI>Two are the moons of my madness, like the horns on the head of a goat. And 
    between them burneth a pyramid of flame, which consumeth neither but blindeth 
    both, so that the one beholdeth not the other. Notwithstanding, when the one 
    is lost in the water, and the other is burnt up in the flame, they become 
    united in the form of a woman fashioned of Earth and of Air, who without husband 
    is yet mother of many sons. 
  <LI>Now the Sons are in truth but one Son; and the one Son but a daughter draped 
    and never naked; for her mother is naked, therefore is she robed. And she 
    is called the Light of my Love, for she is concealed and cannot be seen, as 
    the Sun burneth over her and drowneth her in fire, whilst below her surgeth 
    the sea, whose waves are as flames of water. When thou hast licked up the 
    ocean thou shalt not see her because of the fire; and when thou hast swallowed 
    the Sun surely shall the waters be driven from thee, so that though the fire 
    be thine the water hath slipped thee, as a dog its leash. Yet the path is 
    straight. 
  <LI>Along it shalt thou journey, and then shalt thou learn that the fear of 
    death is the blood of the world. So the woman dressed herself in the shrouds 
    of the dead, and decked herself with the bones of the fallen; and all feared 
    her, therefore they lived. But she feared life; therefore she wove a dew-moon 
    in her tangled hair as a sign of the fickleness of Death, and wept tears of 
    bitter sorrow that she should live in the blossom of her youth. And her tears 
    crept like scorpions down her cheeks, and sped away in the darkness like serpents; 
    and for each serpent came there an eagle which did carry it away. 
  <LI>&quot;Why weep?&quot; said the Balance swinging to the left. &quot;Why laugh?&quot; 
    said the Balance swinging to the right. &quot;Why not remain still?&quot; 
    answered the Hand that held the Balance. And the Balance replied: &quot;Because 
    on my right laughs Death and on my left weeps a Virgin.&quot; 
  <LI>Then the voice of the Hand said to the girl: &quot;Why weep?&quot; And the 
    maid answered: &quot;Because Death maketh jest of my life.&quot; Then the 
    Hand stayed the Balance, and at once the girl saw that she was Death, and 
    that Death that had sat opposite her was in truth a motherless babe. So she 
    took the child she had conceived in the arms of fear, and went her way laughing. 
  <LI>And the infant grew strong; yet its strength was in its weakness; and though 
    to look at it from before was to look upon a man-child, from behind it was 
    a little girl with golden hair. Now, when the child wished to tempt a maid 
    he faced and approached her; and when the child wished to tempt a man she 
    turned her back on him and fled. 
  <LI>But one day the child met, at the self-same hour, Love; and the man, seeing 
    a woman, approached her eagerly, and the woman, seeing a man, fled, so that 
    he might capture her. Thus it came about that the child met the child and 
    wondered, not knowing that the child had lost the child. So it was that they 
    walked side by side. 
  <LI>Then that part of the child that was man loved and lusted for that part 
    of the child that was woman; and each knew not that each was the other, and 
    felt that they were two and yet one, nevertheless one and yet two. And when 
    one said: &quot;Who art thou?&quot; the other answered at the self-same moment: 
    &quot;Who am I?&quot; 
  <LI>Soon becoming perplexed if I were Thou, or if Thou were I, it came about 
    that the I mingled with the Thou, and the Thou with the I, so that six added 
    to ten became sixteen, which is felicity; for it is the interplay of the elements. 
    Four are the elements that make man, and four are the elements that make woman. 
    Thus was the child reborn. 
  <LI>But though the man ruleth the woman, and the woman ruleth the man, the Child 
    ruleth both its mother and father, and being five is Emperor over the kingdom 
    of their hearts. To its father it giveth four, and to its mother it giveth 
    four, yet it remaineth five, for it hath of its father an half and of its 
    mother an half; but in itself it is equal to both its father and its mother; 
    for it is father of fathers and mother of mothers. </LI>
