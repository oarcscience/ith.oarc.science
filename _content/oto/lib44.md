*The Magician, his breast bare, stands before an altar on which are his
Burin, Bell, Thurible, and two of the Cakes of Light. In the Sign of the
Enterer he reaches West across the Altar, and cries:*

Hail Ra, that goest in thy bark  
Into the caverns of the Dark!

*He gives the sign of Silence, and takes the Bell, and Fire, in his
hands.*

East of the Altar see me stand  
With light and musick in my hand!

*He strikes Eleven times upon the Bell 333 - 55555 - 333* and places the
Fire in the Thurible.

I strike the Bell: I light the Flame;  
I utter the mysterious Name.  
ABRAHADABRA

*He strikes eleven times upon the Bell.*

Now I begin to pray: Thou Child,  
Holy Thy name and undefiled!  
Thy reign is come; Thy will is done.  
Here is the Bread; here is the Blood.  
Bring me through midnight to the Sun!  
Save me from Evil and from Good!  
That Thy one crown of all the Ten  
Even now and here be mine. AMEN.

*He puts the first Cake on the Fire of the Thurible.*

I burn the Incense-cake, proclaim  
These adorations of Thy name.

*He makes them as in Liber Legis, and strikes again Eleven times upon
the Bell. With the Burin he then makes upon his breast the proper sign.*

Behold this bleeding breast of mine  
Gashed with the sacramental sign!

*He puts the second Cake to the wound.*

I stanch the Blood; the wafer soaks  
It up, and the high priest invokes!

*He eats the second Cake.*

This Bread I eat. This Oath I swear  
As I enflame myself with prayer:  
"There is no grace: there is no guilt:  
This is the Law: DO WHAT THOU WILT!"

*He strikes Eleven times upon the Bell, and cries*

ABRAHADABRA.  
I entered in with woe; with mirth  
I now go forth, and with thanksgiving,  
To do my pleasure on the earth  
Among the legions of the living.

*He goeth forth.*
