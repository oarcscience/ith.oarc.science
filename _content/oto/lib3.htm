<p>0. Behold the Yoke upon the neck of the Oxen! Is it not thereby that the Field 
  shall be ploughed? The Yoke is heavy, but joineth together them that are separate 
  --- Glory to Nuit and to Hadit, and to Him that hath given us the Symbol of 
  the Rosy Cross!</p>
<p>Glory unto the Lord of the Word Abrahadabra, and Glory unto Him that hath given 
  us the Symbol of the Ankh, and of the Cross within the Circle!</p>
<p>1. Three are the Beasts wherewith thou must plough the Field; the Unicorn, 
  the Horse, and the Ox. And these shalt thou yoke in a triple yoke that is governed 
  by One Whip.</p>
<p>2. Now these Beasts run wildly upon the earths and are not easily obedient 
  to the Man.</p>
<p>3. Nothing shall be said here of Cerberus, the great Beast of Hell that is 
  every one of these and all of these, even as Athanasius hath foreshadowed. For 
  this matter <a href="#1"><font

<p>0. The Unicorn is speech. Man, rule thy Speech! How else shalt thou master 
  the Son, and answer the Magician at the right hand gateway of the Crown?</p>
<p>1. Here are practices. Each may last for a week or more.</p>
<p>2. (a) Avoid using some common word, such as &quot;and&quot; or &quot;the&quot; 
  or &quot;but&quot;; use a paraphrase.</p>
<p>(b) Avoid using some letter of the alphabet, such as &quot;t&quot;, or &quot;s&quot;. 
  or &quot;m&quot;; use a paraphrase.</p>
<p>(c) Avoid using the pronouns and adjectives of the first person; use a paraphrase.</p>
<p>Of thine own ingenium devise others.</p>
<p>2. On each occasion that thou art betrayed into saying that thou art sworn 
  to avoid, cut thyself sharply upon the writs or forearm with a razor; even as 
  thou shouldst beat a disobedient dog. Feareth not the Unicorn the claws and 
  teeth of the Lion?</p>
<p>3. Thine arm then serveth thee both for a warning and for a record. Thou shalt 
  write down thy daily progress in these practices, until thou art perfectly vigilant 
  at all times over the least word that slippeth from thy tongue.</p>
<p>Thus bind thyself, and thou shalt be for ever free.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>II.</strong></p>
<p>0. The Horse is Action. Man, rule thine Action. How else shalt thou master 
  the Father, and answer the Fool at the Left Hand Gateway of the Crown?</p>
<p>1. Here are practices. Each may last for a week, or more.<br>
  (a) Avoiding lifting the left arm above the waist.<br>
  (b) Avoid crossing the legs.<br>
  Of thine own ingenium devise others.<br>
  <br>
  2. On each occasion that thou art betrayed into doing that thou art sworn to 
  avoid, cut thyself sharply upon the wrist or forearm with a razor; even as thou 
  shouldst beat a disobedient dog. Feareth not the Horse the teeth of the Camel?</p>
<p>3. Thine arm then serveth thee both for a warning and for a record. Thou shalt 
  write down thy daily progress in these practices, until thou art perfectly vigilant 
  at all times over the least action that slippeth from the least of thy fingers.</p>
<p>Thus bind thyself, and thou shalt be for ever free.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>III.</strong></p>
<p>0. The Ox is Thought. Man, rule thy Thought! How else shalt thou master the 
  Holy Spirit, and answer the High Priestess in the Middle Gateway of the Crown?</p>
<p>1. Here are practices. Each may last for a week or more. (a) Avoid thinking 
  of a definite subject and all things connected with it, and let that subject 
  be one which commonly occupies much of thy thought, being frequently stimulated 
  by sense-perceptions or the conversation of others.</p>
<p>(b) By some device, such as the changing of thy ring from one finger to another, 
  create in thyself two personalities, the thoughts of one being within entirely 
  different limits from that of the other, the common ground being the necessities 
  of life.<a

    in the Holy Qabalah, a vegetarian, and a keen &quot;reactionary&quot; politician. 
    Let B be a bloodless and ascetic thinker, occupied with business and family 
    cares, an eater of meat, and a keen progressive politician. Let no thought 
    proper to &quot;A&quot; arise when the ring is on the &quot;B&quot; finger, 
    and vice versa.</li>
