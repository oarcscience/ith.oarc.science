<h1 align="center" class="title">Liber VIII</h1>
<h2 align="center" class="heading">A.·. A.·. Publication in Class D</h2>
<p>And thus shall he do who will attain unto the mystery of the knowledge and 
  conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel: </p>
<p>First, let him prepare a chamber, of which the walls and the roof shall be 
  white, and the floor shall be covered with a carpet of black squares and white, 
  and the border thereof shall be blue and gold. </p>
<p>And if it be in a town, the room shall have no window, and if it be in the 
  country, then it is better if the window be in the roof. Or, if it be possible, 
  let this invocation be performed in a temple prepared for the ritual of passing 
  through the Tuat. </p>
<p>From the roof he shall hang a lamp, wherein is a red glass, to burn olive oil. 
  And this lamp shall he cleanse and make ready after the prayer of sunset, and 
  beneath the lamp shall be an altar, foursquare, &amp; the height shall be thrice 
  half of the breadth or double the breadth. </p>
<p>And upon the altar shall be a censor, hemispherical, supported upon three legs, 
  of silver, and within it an hemisphere of copper, and upon the top a grating 
  of gilded silver, and thereupon shall he burn incense made of four parts of 
  olibanum and two parts of stacte, and one part of lignum aloes, or of cedar, 
  or of sandal. And this is enough. </p>
<p>And he shall also keep ready in a flask of crystal within the altar, holy anointing 
  oil made of myrrh and cinnamon and galangal. </p>
<p>And even if he be of higher rank than a Probationer, he shall yet wear the 
  robe of the Probationer, for the star of flame showeth forth Ra Hoor Khuit openly 
  upon the breast, and secretly the blue triangle that descendeth is Nuit, and 
  the red triangle that ascendeth is Hadit. And I am the golden Tau in the midst 
  of their marriage. Also, if he choose, he may instead wear a close-fitting robe 
  of shot silk, purple and green, and upon it a cloak without sleeves, of bright 
  blue, covered with golden sequins, and scarlet within. </p>
<p>And he shall make himself a wand of almond wood or of hazel cut by his own 
  hands at dawn at the Equinox, or at the Solstice, or on the day of Corpus Christi, 
  or on one of the feast-days that are appointed in &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;. 
</p>
<p>And he shall engrave with his own hand upon the plate of gold the Holy Sevenfold 
  Table, or the Holy Twelvefold Table, or some particular device. And it shall 
  be foursquare within a circle, and the circle shall be winged, and he shall 
  attach it about his forehead by a ribbon of blue silk. </p>
<p>Moreover, he shall wear a fillet of laurel or rose or ivy or rue, and every 
  day, after the prayer of sunrise, he shall burn it in the fire of the censor. 
</p>
<p>Now he shall pray thrice daily, about sunset, and at midnight, and at sunrise. 
  And if he be able, he shall pray also four times between sunrise and sunset. 
</p>
<p>The prayer shall last for the space of an hour, at the least, and he shall 
  seek ever to extend it, and to inflame himself in praying. Thus shall he invoke 
  his Holy Guardian Angel for eleven weeks, and in any case he shall pray seven 
  times daily during the last week of the eleven weeks. </p>
<p>And during all this time he shall have composed an invocation suitable, with 
  such wisdom and understanding as may be given him from the Crown, and this shall 
  he write in letters of gold upon the top of the altar. </p>
<p>For the top of the altar shall be of white wood, well polished, and in the 
  centre thereof he shall have placed a triangle of oak-wood, painted with scarlet, 
  and upon this triangle the three legs of the censor shall stand. </p>
<p>Moreover, he shall copy his invocation upon a sheet of pure white vellum, with 
  Indian ink, and he shall illuminate it according to his fancy and imagination, 
  that shall be informed by beauty. </p>
<p>And on the first day of the twelfth week he shall enter the chamber at sunrise, 
  and he shall make his prayer, having first burnt the conjuration that he had 
  made upon the vellum in the fire of the lamp. </p>
<p>Then, at his prayer, shall the chamber be filled with light insufferable for 
  splendour, and a perfume intolerable for sweetness. And his Holy Guardian Angel 
  shall appear unto him, yea, his Holy Guardian Angel shall appear unto him, so 
  that he shall be wrapt away into the Mystery of Holiness. </p>
<p>All that day shall he remain in the enjoyment of the knowledge and conversation 
  of the Holy Guardian Angel. </p>
<p>And for three days after he shall remain from sunrise unto sunset in the temple, 
  and he shall obey the counsel that his Angel shall have given unto him, and 
  he shall suffer those things that are appointed. </p>
<p>And for ten days thereafter shall he withdraw himself as shall have been taught 
  unto him from the fullness of that communion, for he must harmonize the world 
  that is within with the world that is without. </p>
<p>And at the end of the ninety-one days he shall return into the world, and there 
  shall he perform that work to which the Angel shall have appointed him. </p>
<p>And more than this it is not necessary to say, for his Angel shall have entreated 
  him kindly, and showed him in what manner he may be most perfectly involved. 
  And unto him that hath this Master there is nothing else that he needeth, so 
  long as he continue in the knowledge and conversation of the Angel, so that 
  he shall come at last into the City of the Pyramids.</p>
